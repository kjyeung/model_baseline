        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern between the input and output in the training examples so I can apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the input has some numbers in the second and fourth rows. The output seems to create a symmetrical pattern. For instance, the second input row is [0,8,0,1,...], and the output's second row becomes [0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,8,0]. It looks like the numbers are mirrored around the center. The 8 and 1 are placed symmetrically. Similarly, in the fourth row of input, [0,1,0,2,...], the output row has 1 and 2 mirrored. So maybe the pattern is taking certain elements from the input and reflecting them symmetrically in the output rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's second row has a 3 at position 17. The output's second row has 3 at both ends. Similarly, the fourth input row has a 4 and 1, which in the output become mirrored as 4,1, etc. So again, the non-zero elements are mirrored on both ends of their respective rows.\n\nExample 2 has input rows with 4,3 and 3,1. The output rows for these are mirrored with 4 and 3 on both ends, and then 3 and 1 mirrored. Also, there's an 8 in the fifth row of the input. In the output, that 8 is mirrored on both sides. Wait, in example 2's input, the fifth row has an 8 at position 5. The output's fifth row is [0,3,0,0,0,8,...], but then in the mirrored part, there's another 8 towards the end. So maybe elements are mirrored in their own row, creating a symmetric pattern.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern seems to be: For each row in the input that contains non-zero elements, the output row is created by mirroring those non-zero elements symmetrically around the center of the row. So if there's a number in position i, it's also placed in position (length - 1 - i), creating a mirror image. The rows that are all zeros in the input remain zeros in the output. But wait, in the examples, some rows that were all zeros in the input have non-zero in the output. Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, the second row has [0,8,0,1, ...], and the output's second row is mirrored. However, the output's fourth row also has non-zeros that are mirrored. So maybe the process is to take each non-zero element in the input rows and mirror them on both ends, filling the row with those numbers in a symmetric fashion. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row in the input is transformed by taking the non-zero elements and placing their mirror images symmetrically. For example, if the input row has a non-zero at position x, then the output row will have that value at position x and at position (n-1 -x), where n is the length of the row. But looking at the first example, the input row is [0,8,0,1,...], and the output row becomes [0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1, etc., then 0,8]. Wait, that's not just mirroring the existing elements. The 8 is at index 1 and 17 (since the row is 19 elements long). 1 is at index 3, and then mirrored at 15 (since 19-1 -3 = 15). But in the output row, after 1 at position 3, there are 0,1,0,1, etc. So maybe it's not just mirroring the existing elements but creating a pattern where the elements are repeated symmetrically with alternating positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a reflection where the entire row is mirrored. Let's check the lengths. The input rows in the examples are length 19. For example, in Example 0's input row 2: the output row starts with 0,8,0,1, then alternates 0,1 up to the middle, then mirrors back. Wait, the output row for Example 0's second row is [0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,8,0]. So the 8 is at positions 1 and 17 (since 19-1-1=17). The 1s are at positions 3,5,7,9,11,13,15, which when mirrored would be positions 17-3=14? Wait, maybe I'm not calculating correctly. Wait, the output row has 1s at positions 3,5,7, etc., and mirrored on the right side. So maybe the pattern is that the non-zero elements in the input row are used to start a sequence that alternates between their value and 0, and then this sequence is mirrored to the other half of the row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero in the input row is a seed that creates a symmetric pattern. For example, in Example 0's input row 2 (the second row), there's 8 and 1. The output row alternates 0 and 1 between those positions, and the 8 is at both ends.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is as follows: For each row in the input, if there are non-zero elements, the output row is constructed by placing the non-zero elements symmetrically. For instance, if the input row has a value at position i, the output row will have that value at position i and the mirrored position (18 - i in a 19-element row). Then, between these mirrored positions, the values are filled in a pattern. For example, in Example 0's input row 1 (the second row in input) has 8 at position 1 and 1 at position 3. The output row then has 8 at 1 and 17 (mirror), 1 at 3 and 15 (mirror of 3 is 15?), then the 1 is repeated every two positions until the mirror point. So the pattern fills the gaps between the original positions with alternating values. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a diamond or symmetrical pattern based on the positions of the non-zero elements in the input. For example, in Example 0's output, the second row has 8 at the ends and 1s alternating in between. The input for that row had 8 and 1. So perhaps the output is creating a symmetric pattern where the non-zero elements are placed at both ends, and then the same values are repeated in a mirrored way towards the center.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compare the input and output row by row for each example.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput row 1 (index 1 if starting from 0) is [0,8,0,1, ...]. The output row is [0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,8,0]. So the 8 is at both ends, and between the original 8 and 1, there's an alternating 0 and 1. Then, after the 1 at position 3, the pattern continues as 0,1,0,1... until the end. Wait, the original input has 8 at position 1 and 1 at position 3. The output has 8 at positions 1 and 17 (since 19-1-1=17). Then, starting from position 3, there's 1 followed by 0,1,0,1, etc., up to position 15, and then 1 again, leading to 8 at position 17.\n\nWait, how does that happen? Let's count the positions (0-based):\n\nInput row 1 (0-based index 1):\n\nPositions: 0:0, 1:8, 2:0, 3:1, rest 0.\n\nOutput row 1:\n\n0:0,1:8,2:0,3:1,4:0,5:1,6:0,7:1,8:0,9:1,10:0,11:1,12:0,13:1,14:0,15:1,16:0,17:8,18:0.\n\nSo the pattern after position 3 is alternating 0 and 1, up to position 15, then 1 at 15, 0 at 16, 8 at 17.\n\nHmm, but why the alternation? The input has 1 at position 3, and the output creates a sequence of 1s every two positions. Similarly, the 8 is mirrored. So perhaps, once a non-zero is found, the output creates a pattern of that value every other position, starting from that position and moving towards the center, and then mirrored on the other side.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero elements in the input act as the starting points, and between those points and their mirrored positions, the same value is placed in every other position.\n\nBut this might be complicated. Let me think of another way.\n\nAnother observation: In all the examples, the output is a symmetric version of the input, with certain patterns extended. For instance, in Example 0, the output has a diamond-like structure, where the 8 and 1 are mirrored, and the 2 in the fourth row is mirrored as well. Similarly, in Example 1, the 3s are mirrored at the ends, and the 4 and 1s create a symmetric pattern. The 8 in Example 2's input is mirrored in the output.\n\nWait, looking at the test input:\n\nThe test input has a non-zero at row 11 (position 5 with 8), row 13 (position 5 with 4 and position 6 with 8), row 15 (3 and 2), and row 17 (1 and 3). So applying the same pattern, each of these non-zero elements should be mirrored in their respective rows. For example, the 8 in row 11 (0-based index 11) at position 5 would be mirrored at position 13 (since 18-5=13?), making the output row 11 have 8 at 5 and 13. Similarly, row 13 has 4 at 5 and 8 at 6. So their mirrored positions would be 4 at 5 and 18-5=13? Wait, no, 18 is the last index (since 0-18). So for position 5, the mirror is 18-5=13. So 8 in position 6 would be mirrored at 12. So row 13's input has 4 at 5 and 8 at 6. The output would mirror them to 13 and 12, respectively. Then between those positions, maybe fill with the same values in a pattern.\n\nBut how to handle multiple elements in a single row. Let's look at Example 2's fifth row (input row 5, 0-based index 5). The input is [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,...]. The output row is [0,3,0,0,0,8,0,0,...,0,8,0,0,0,3,0]. Wait, no. Wait in Example 2's output for row 5 (index 5), the output is [0,3,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,3,0]. So the 8 in position 5 is mirrored at position 13 (since 18-5=13). Also, the 3 in position 1 and 17 comes from the original row 1's 4 and 3? Wait, maybe not. The input row 5 has 8, but the output row 5 has 3 at the ends. Oh, this complicates things.\n\nWait, maybe the mirroring is not per row but involves combining elements from other rows. For example, in Example 0, the input's row 1 has 8 and 1. The output's row 1 and row 16 (from the end) are mirrored. So maybe the output is a reflection of the entire grid vertically, but that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a diamond-shaped pattern where the non-zero elements in the input are mirrored both horizontally and vertically. But that might not explain all the examples.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of each row as being transformed into a symmetrical version where the non-zero elements are placed symmetrically. For example, if a row has a non-zero element at position i, then the output row will have that element at i and at (18 - i). Then, between those positions, the same value is placed in every other position. Let's check this.\n\nTake Example 0's input row 1: [0,8,0,1, ...]. The non-zero elements are at positions 1 and 3. The output row has 8 at 1 and 17 (18-1=17), and 1 at 3,5,7,...,15,17-3=15. Wait, but the output has 1s at 3,5,7,9,11,13,15. So between 3 and 15, stepping by 2. Similarly, the 8 is at 1 and 17. So perhaps the pattern is: for each non-zero element in the input row, the output places that value at every even step from the original position towards the mirrored position.\n\nAlternatively, once a non-zero is found in the input row, the output creates a sequence starting from that position, alternating between 0 and the value, until the mirrored position. For example, 8 at position 1: the mirrored is 17. So from 1 to 17, every even index (1,3,5,...) would be 8,0,8,0, etc. But in the example, it's 8 at 1 and 17, with 0 and 1 in between. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output uses the input's non-zero elements as the starting points and then fills the row in a pattern that alternates between the value and zero, but mirrored. For example, the input row has 8 at position 1 and 1 at 3. The output starts at 1 with 8, then 0, then 1 at 3, then 0,1,0,1... up to the mirrored position. Wait, in the output row, after position 3, it's 0,1,0,1... up to position 15, then 0,8. So maybe each non-zero in the input starts a sequence of their value alternating with zero, mirrored on the other side.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking each non-zero element in the input row and creating a symmetric pattern where the element is placed at intervals, filling the space between the original position and its mirror.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to see if there's a simpler pattern. Looking at the outputs, the non-zero elements in the input rows are mirrored in the output, and between them, there's a pattern of alternating the value and zero. For example, in Example 0's second row, the 8 is at both ends. The 1 from position 3 is mirrored at position 15, and between 3 and 15, there are alternating 1 and 0. Wait, but positions 3,5,7, etc., have 1,0,1,0. So in the output, after the initial 1 at 3, every other position (5,7,9,...) has 1. But how does that mirror?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero elements in the input row are used as the start and end points of a pattern where the value is placed at every other position between them, including their mirrored positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero in the input row is expanded into a sequence that starts at the original position and the mirrored position, filling the space between with alternating values. For example, if there's a 8 at position 1 in the input, then in the output, it's placed at 1 and 17 (mirror), and between them, every other position (3,5, etc.) gets 8. But in Example 0's output, between 1 and 17, the 8s are only at the ends. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers in the input are like seeds that create a symmetrical pattern. For example, if there's an 8 in the input row, the output row has 8 at both ends. Then, any other number in the input row (like 1) would start a pattern of alternating 1 and 0, mirrored. So the 1 at position 3 in the input would lead to 1s at 3,5,7,...15,17 (but in the example, the 1s stop at 15 and then there's an 8 at 17). So maybe the pattern is to take each non-zero in the input row and mirror it, and then fill the row with that value in every other position starting from the original and mirrored positions.\n\nThis is still confusing. Let's try to see for the Test Input.\n\nThe Test Input's non-zero elements are in rows 11,13,15,17.\n\nRow 11 (input) has 8 at position 5. According to the pattern observed, in the output row 11, this 8 would be mirrored at position 13 (18-5=13). So the output row would have 8 at 5 and 13. Then, between them, perhaps alternating 8 and 0? But in Example 2, the input row 5 had an 8 at position 5, and the output row 5 had 8 at 5 and 13, and then 3s at the ends. Wait, but in Example 2, the input row 1 (index 1) had 4 and 3. The output row 1 had 4 at both ends, and 3s in between. So maybe the 8 in row 11 would be mirrored, and the rest of the row is filled with zeros except for other non-zero elements from other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are created by taking all non-zero elements from the input and their mirrored positions, then filling the gaps with alternating values. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a vertical and horizontal mirror of the input. But looking at the examples, the output is not just a mirror. For instance, in Example 0, the input's fourth row has [0,1,0,2,...], and the output's fourth row has 1 and 2 mirrored. So row 3 (0-based) in the input has 1 and 2. In the output row 3, it's [0,1,0,2,0,0,...0,2,0,1,0]. So the 2 is at position 3 and 15 (mirror of 3 is 15). The 1 is at positions 1 and 17 (mirror of 1 is 17). But the output row also has 1 at position 17. Hmm.\n\nWait, the input row 3 in Example 0 is [0,1,0,2,...]. The output row 3 is [0,1,0,2,0,0,...0,2,0,1,0]. Wait, that's not exactly mirrored. The 2 is at position 3 and 15 (mirror of 3 is 15), but the 1 is at positions 1 and 17 (mirror of 1 is 17). So the output row 3 has 1 at both ends and 2 mirrored in the middle. Then the rest of the row is zeros. So maybe the pattern is that each non-zero element in the input row is mirrored in the output row, but if there are multiple non-zero elements, they are each mirrored. Between the mirrored positions, other elements are filled based on some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by taking each row of the input and creating a symmetrical version where any non-zero element is mirrored, and the values between are filled with their own value in a pattern that creates symmetry.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me try to think of the Test Input.\n\nTest Input row 15 (0-based index 15) has [0,3,0,2,...]. So 3 at position 1 and 2 at position 3. In the output, these would be mirrored. So 3 would be at positions 1 and 17 (18-1=17), and 2 at positions 3 and 15 (18-3=15). So the output row would have 3 at 1 and 17, 2 at 3 and 15. Between 3 and 15, perhaps alternating 2 and 0. But let's see what happened in Example 0's similar case. In Example 0's row 3 (input [0,1,0,2]), the output row 3 is [0,1,0,2,0,0,...0,2,0,1,0]. So between 2 and its mirror 15, there are zeros. So maybe the non-zero elements are just mirrored, and the rest are zeros. But in Example 0's row 1, the output had alternating 1s. So there's inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by mirroring each non-zero element in their own row, and then filling in between them with the same value repeated every other position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is built by taking the non-zero elements in the input and expanding them into a palindromic sequence. For example, if a row has elements a, b, c, ... then the output row is a, b, c, ..., c, b, a. But that doesn't fit the examples. In Example 0's row 1 input is [0,8,0,1,...], output is [0,8,0,1,0,1,...0,8,0]. Which is not a simple palindrome.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is a palindrome where the non-zero elements are mirrored, but between them, the same values are filled in a way that creates a symmetrical pattern.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try to find another approach. Let's look for the general pattern in the examples:\n\nIn each example, the output is a symmetric version of the input, but with certain elements repeated in a symmetric way. The non-zero elements in the input rows are mirrored in their respective output rows, and between them, their values are placed in a symmetric pattern.\n\nFor example, in Example 0:\n\nInput row 1: [0,8,0,1, ...]\nOutput row 1: [0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,8,0]\nHere, 8 is at positions 1 and 17 (mirror), and 1 is at 3,5,7,...15, which are mirrored around the center. So the pattern for 1 is alternating 0 and 1 starting from position 3, but mirrored to the other side.\n\nBut how does that happen? It looks like for each non-zero element in the input row, the output row places that value at every even position from the original to the mirrored position. For example, 1 at position 3 would generate 1s at 3,5,7,9,11,13,15, which are all the odd positions from 3 to 15. Then mirrored, but since the row is symmetric, it's already covered.\n\nAlternatively, the non-zero elements in the input row are used as the starting points, and the output row is built by placing those values in a symmetric fashion, filling in between with alternating 0 and the value.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput row 1 (index 1) has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]. The output row 1 is [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]. So the 3 is mirrored at positions 1 and 17. Between them, zeros. But in other rows of Example 1, like row 3, the input has 0,0,0,4,0,1, ... and the output row 3 has 4 at positions 3 and 15, and 1s at 5,7,9,11,13, which are mirrored. So the 4 is mirrored, and between them, 1s are placed alternately.\n\nHmm. So maybe when there are multiple non-zero elements in a row, their mirrored positions are calculated, and between them, their values are filled alternately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a reflection where each non-zero element is mirrored and then the space between them is filled with the same value in a pattern that alternates with zeros.\n\nBut how to handle multiple elements in the same row.\n\nAnother observation: The output rows seem to have the same number of non-zero elements as the input rows, but mirrored and expanded. For instance, Example 0's row 1 input has two non-zero elements, and the output row has multiple non-zeros but symmetrically placed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking each non-zero in the input row, placing it and its mirror, then filling the space between with alternating values of the same number. For example, if the input row has a 8 at position 1, then the output row has 8 at 1 and 17, and between them, places 8 every other position. But in Example 0's row 1 output, between 1 and 17, there are 1s instead of 8s, which complicates this idea.\n\nWait, in Example 0's row 1 input, the non-zero elements are 8 and 1. So the 8 is mirrored, and the 1 is mirrored, and between the 1's original position and its mirror, the 1s are placed alternately. So perhaps each non-zero element in the input row is treated separately. For each such element, the output row has that element at its original position and mirrored, and the space between them is filled with that element every other position. So for 8 at position 1: mirrored at 17, and between them, every other position (3,5,7, etc.) would have 8. But in the output, they have 1s. So that's not the case. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements are filled with their own value in a mirrored fashion, but the highest value takes precedence. For example, if there are multiple non-zero elements in a row, their mirroring is combined, and overlapping positions take the higher value. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Let's try to find a rule that fits all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0's row 1: input has 8 and 1. The output row has 8 at both ends, and between them, alternating 0 and 1 starting from the 1's original position. So perhaps the 1 is mirrored, and then between the original 1 and its mirror, alternating 1 and 0. The 8 is mirrored at the ends, and the rest is filled with the 1's pattern.\n\nBut why would the 8 be only at the ends and not interfere with the 1's pattern? Because the 8 is at positions 1 and 17, and the 1's pattern starts at 3 and goes up to 15.\n\nIn Example 1's row 3: input has 4 at position 15 and 1 at position 13. The output row 3 has 4 at positions 3 and 15 (mirror of 3 is 15?), and 1s alternating between 5 and 13. Wait, the input row 3's non-zero elements are at 15 (4) and 13 (1). The output row 3 has 4 at 3 and 15, and 1s at 5,7,9,11,13. So perhaps the mirroring is done around the center of the row. Wait, the mirroring may be done around the center index (9, since there are 19 elements). So for any position i, the mirrored position is 18 - i.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's row 1, the 8 is at position 1. Mirrored position is 18-1=17. So 8 is at 1 and 17. The 1 is at position 3. Mirrored is 15. So in the output, 1 is at 3 and 15, but the output also has 1s at 5,7, etc. So between 3 and 15, every even position (3,5,7,9,11,13,15) has 1. That's every other position starting at 3, incrementing by 2. So the 1 is placed at every even index between 3 and 15 inclusive. So the pattern is that for each non-zero element in the input row, the output row places that value at every even index from the original position to the mirrored position, inclusive.\n\nBut then how does this work for Example 1's row 3. Input has 4 at position 15 and 1 at position 13. The output row has 4 at position 3 (mirror of 15 is 3) and 15. The 1 at position 13's mirror is 5. So between 5 and 13, every even position (5,7,9,11,13) has 1. So the output row 3 is [0,0,0,4,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,4,0,0,0]. Wait, no, in the actual output for Example 1's row 3, it's [0,0,0,4,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,4,0,0,0]. So yes, the 4 is at 3 and 15, and the 1s are at 5,7,9,11,13. Which matches the pattern of every even index between 5 and 13.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\nFor each non-zero element in the input row at position i:\n\n- Place the value at position i and its mirror position (18 - i).\n\n- Fill every other position between i and mirror(i) with the same value, alternating with zeros.\n\nBut how to handle overlapping ranges from multiple elements in the same row.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's row 1, the 8 is at 1 and 17, and the 1 is at 3 and 15. The 1's pattern fills positions 3,5,7,9,11,13,15, which are between 3 and 15. The 8's pattern would be between 1 and 17, but since the 1's pattern is in between, perhaps the 1's pattern takes precedence.\n\nAlternatively, the elements are processed in order, and later elements overwrite the previous ones. Or higher values take precedence. But in Example 0's output, the 1's pattern overwrites the 8's potential pattern between 3 and 15.\n\nBut how to decide which elements are processed first. It's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps each non-zero element in the input row is processed, and their patterns are combined, but overlapping positions are filled with the sum of the values, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, each element is processed separately, and their patterns are placed in the output row, but if two elements' patterns overlap, the last one processed takes precedence. But how to determine the order.\n\nAlternatively, the elements are processed from left to right, and each non-zero element's pattern is added to the output row, overwriting any previous values.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's row 1, first process the 8 at position 1:\n\n- Place 8 at 1 and 17.\n\n- Fill positions 1,3,5,...17 with 8 every other position.\n\nThen process the 1 at position 3:\n\n- Place 1 at 3 and 15.\n\n- Fill positions 3,5,7,...15 with 1 every other position, overwriting the 8s in those positions.\n\nSo the output would have 8 at 1 and 17, and 1s between 3 and 15. Which matches the example.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- Initialize the output row as all zeros.\n\n- For each non-zero element in the input row, from left to right:\n\n   - Let pos be the position of the non-zero element.\n\n   - Let value be the element's value.\n\n   - The mirror position is 18 - pos.\n\n   - For each position j from pos to mirror_pos, step of 2:\n\n      - If j is within the row (0 <= j < 19), set output[j] = value.\n\nSo this would create a pattern where each non-zero element in the input row creates a sequence of its value every other position from the original to the mirror position, and any overlapping positions are overwritten by subsequent elements.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's row 1:\n\nInput row 1 has 8 at position 1 and 1 at position 3.\n\nProcess 8 first:\n\n- pos=1, mirror=17.\n\n- j runs from 1 to 17, step 2: positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17.\n\n- Set these to 8. So the row becomes [0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0].\n\nThen process 1 at position 3:\n\n- pos=3, mirror=15.\n\n- j runs from 3 to 15, step 2: 3,5,7,9,11,13,15.\n\n- Set these to 1. So the row becomes [0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,8,0].\n\nWhich matches Example 0's output row 1.\n\nAnother test with Example 1's row 1:\n\nInput row 1 has 3 at position 17 (0-based index 17). Processing this element:\n\n- pos=17, mirror=18-17=1.\n\n- j runs from 17 down to 1 with step -2 (since 17 to 1 is decreasing). But how to handle the direction. Alternatively, regardless of pos and mirror_pos, iterate from pos to mirror_pos, but if pos > mirror_pos, swap them.\n\nBut in code terms, to generate positions from pos to mirror_pos with step 2 (if pos <= mirror_pos) or step -2 (if pos > mirror_pos). So for pos=17, mirror_pos=1:\n\n- Iterate from 17 down to 1, step of -2. Positions 17,15,13,11,9,7,5,3,1.\n\n- Set these to 3. So output row becomes [0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0].\n\nBut in Example 1's output row 1, it's [0,3,0,0,0,...0,3,0]. So this doesn't match. Hmm, there's a problem.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input row 1, the only non-zero element is at position 17 (value 3). According to the rule, the output row would have 3 at positions 17,15,13,11,9,7,5,3,1. But in the actual output, row 1 has 3 at positions 1 and 17, and zeros in between. So this contradicts the rule. So this suggests that the previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nLooking at Example 1's row 1 input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]. The output row is [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]. So the only non-zeros are at positions 1 and 17. So the rule must be that the non-zero element is mirrored, but the positions between are not filled with the value. So the previous idea of filling every other position is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is different. Maybe the output simply mirrors the non-zero elements in the row, without filling in between. But then, in Example 0's row 1, the input has 8 and 1, and the output has 8 at 1 and 17, 1 at 3 and 15, but also filling the between positions with 1s. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, let's re-examine Example 1's input row 3. The input row has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,0,0]. So non-zero at position 13 (value 1) and 15 (value 4). The output row 3 is [0,0,0,4,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,4,0,0,0]. So 4 is at positions 3 and 15 (mirror of 15 is 3), and 1 is at positions 5,7,9,11,13 (mirror of 13 is 5). So between 5 and 13, every even position has 1. So here, the non-zero elements are mirrored and filled in between.\n\nBut in row 1 of Example 1, the input has 3 at position 17. Mirrored at 1. The output has 3 at 1 and 17, but the positions in between are zeros. So why is there a difference?\n\nAh, perhaps the rule is that if the non-zero element is in the second half of the row (position >9), then when mirrored to the first half, the filling is done between the mirrored positions. But in Example 1's row 1, the non-zero is at 17 (mirror 1), so the mirrored positions are 1 and 17, and the filling is between them. But in the output, there's no filling. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the filling occurs only if the non-zero element is in the first half of the row. So in Example 0's row 1, the non-zero elements are in positions 1 and 3 (first half), so the filling is done between them and their mirrors. In Example 1's row 1, the non-zero is in position 17 (mirror 1), which is in the first half. But the filling isn't done. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: the filling between mirrored positions occurs only if the original position is in the first half of the row. So, if the non-zero element is in the first half (positions 0-8), then the filling is done between it and its mirror. If it's in the second half (9-18), then only the mirror is placed. But this doesn't explain Example 1's row 3, where the 4 is at position 15 (second half), and its mirror is 3 (first half). The filling between 3 and 15 includes 4 at 3 and 15, and 1s in between.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Let's think about the output as a diamond or symmetrical structure where each non-zero in the input generates a vertical and horizontal line of its value, creating a diamond shape. For example, in Example 0, the 8 in row 1, column 1, generates a diamond pattern in the output. But how to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a reflection across the middle row. But the examples don't support this.\n\nLet me try to think differently. In all the examples, the output seems to be a symmetrical pattern where each non-zero element in the input is mirrored in its row and also in the corresponding column. But this would require considering both row and column symmetry. For example, in Example 0, the input's row 1 has 8 and 1, which are mirrored in the output's row 1. The same values appear in row 16 (mirror row of row 1), creating a vertical symmetry. But looking at Example 0's output, the first and last rows are all zeros. The second row is mirrored in the penultimate row. So there's vertical mirroring as well. So maybe the output is a combination of horizontal and vertical mirroring of the input's non-zero elements.\n\nFor instance, each non-zero element in the input is mirrored both horizontally (within its row) and vertically (across the middle row), creating a diamond pattern. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the non-zero elements are in rows 1 and 3. The output's mirrored rows are 16 and 14 (since the grid has 19 rows, the middle row is 9). So row 1's mirror is row 17 (18-1=17), and row 3's mirror is row 15. Looking at Example 0's output, row 17 is [0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1,...], which is the same as row 1. So vertical mirroring is present. Similarly, row 3's mirror is row 15, which in the output has [0,1,0,2,...] mirrored as row 15.\n\nSo the output is a vertical and horizontal mirror of the input's non-zero elements, creating a symmetrical pattern both vertically and horizontally. Additionally, each non-zero element in the input is mirrored in its own row, and the corresponding mirrored rows are filled similarly.\n\nSo for the Test Input, non-zero elements are in rows 11,13,15,17. Their vertical mirrors would be rows 7,5,3,1 (since 18-11=7, 18-13=5, etc.). So the output would have mirrored non-zero elements in those mirrored rows as well.\n\nFor example, the Test Input's row 15 has [0,3,0,2,...]. This would be mirrored to row 3. The non-zero elements 3 and 2 in row 15 would appear in row 3's output, mirrored in their row. Similarly, row 17's non-zero elements (1 and 3) would be mirrored to row 1's output.\n\nBut how to handle the horizontal mirroring within each row. For example, the 3 in row 15's input position 1 would be mirrored to position 17 in that row. The 2 in position 3 would be mirrored to position 15. Additionally, row 15's mirrored row is row 3, so the 3 and 2 would also appear in row 3's output, mirrored.\n\nThis seems plausible. So the transformation involves taking each non-zero element in the input grid and mirroring it both horizontally (within the row) and vertically (across the middle row), creating a symmetrical pattern.\n\nThus, the steps would be:\n\n1. For each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\n   a. If the cell has a non-zero value, set the following cells in the output grid to that value:\n\n      i. The original cell (i,j).\n\n      ii. The horizontally mirrored cell (i, 18-j).\n\n      iii. The vertically mirrored cell (18-i, j).\n\n      iv. The horizontally and vertically mirrored cell (18-i, 18-j).\n\n2. After processing all cells, any cell that wasn't set by the above steps remains zero.\n\nBut in the examples, this doesn't seem to cover all cases. For example, in Example 0's input row 1 (i=1), j=1 has 8. According to this rule, the output would set (1,1), (1,17), (17,1), (17,17) to 8. Similarly, j=3 has 1, so (1,3), (1,15), (17,3), (17,15) would be set to 1. Looking at the output, row 17 has 8 at 1 and 17, and 1s at 3,5,...15. So this rule doesn't explain the additional 1s between 3 and 15. Therefore, this approach is incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, the horizontal and vertical mirroring is combined with a spreading pattern where each non-zero element generates a diamond pattern in the output. For example, a non-zero at (i,j) generates values in a diamond shape around it. But again, this is speculative.\n\nLet me look for another pattern. In Example 0's output, the non-zero elements form a diamond-like pattern. For instance, the 8s are at the corners of a diamond, and the 1s form inner layers. This suggests that each non-zero element is expanded into a diamond shape in the output, with the size of the diamond depending on the value.\n\nAlternatively, the value determines how far the pattern spreads. For example, 8 might create a larger diamond than 1. But looking at Example 0's output, the 8s are only at the ends of certain rows, while the 1s are spread more. This might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the values are irrelevant, and the pattern is determined by the position. For example, non-zero elements are mirrored both horizontally and vertically, and the cells in between are filled with the same value. For example, a non-zero at (i,j) would fill all cells (i',j') where i' and j' are mirrored versions of i and j, creating a cross or diamond pattern.\n\nBut this is unclear. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the initial hypothesis that each non-zero in the input row is mirrored in the same row, and between the original and mirror position, the value is placed every other position. This seems to fit some examples but not others. However, given the test input, perhaps this is the pattern to apply.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the Test Input.\n\nTest Input's non-zero elements:\n\nRow 11 (index 11): position 5 has 8.\n\nRow 13 (index 13): position 5 has 4, position 6 has 8.\n\nRow 15 (index 15): position 1 has 3, position 3 has 2.\n\nRow 17 (index 17): position 1 has 1, position 3 has 3.\n\nLet's process each row:\n\nRow 11:\n\nNon-zero at 5: value 8.\n\nMirror position: 18-5=13.\n\nSo fill positions 5,7,9,11,13 with 8. So output row 11: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 13:\n\nNon-zero at 5 (4) and 6 (8).\n\nProcess 4 first:\n\nMirror position for 5 is 13 (18-5=13). Fill positions 5,7,9,11,13 with 4.\n\nThen process 8 at 6:\n\nMirror position for 6 is 12 (18-6=12). Fill positions 6,8,10,12 with 8.\n\nSo the output row 13 would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nWait, but this may not be correct. Let's see:\n\nFor 4 at position 5:\n\nMirror is 13. So positions 5,7,9,11,13 are filled with 4.\n\nThen for 8 at position 6:\n\nMirror is 12. Positions 6,8,10,12 are filled with 8.\n\nSo overlapping positions like 8 would have 8 overwrite any previous value.\n\nThus, row 13 becomes:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nBut looking at the Test Input's row 13: input has 4 at 5 and 8 at 6. The output would have 4 and 8 mirrored and filled between.\n\nRow 15:\n\nNon-zero at 1 (3) and 3 (2).\n\nProcess 3 at 1:\n\nMirror position is 17. Fill positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17 with 3.\n\nThen process 2 at 3:\n\nMirror position is 15. Fill positions 3,5,7,9,11,13,15 with 2.\n\nSo the output row 15 would have:\n\n0,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,3,0.\n\nRow 17:\n\nNon-zero at 1 (1) and 3 (3).\n\nProcess 1 at 1:\n\nMirror position 17. Fill positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17 with 1.\n\nThen process 3 at 3:\n\nMirror position 15. Fill positions 3,5,7,9,11,13,15 with 3.\n\nSo output row 17:\n\n0,1,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,1,0.\n\nBut wait, the input row 17 has 1 and 3. Processing 1 first fills positions 1,3,5,...17 with 1. Then processing 3 fills positions 3,5,...15 with 3, overwriting the 1s. So the final row would have 1 at 1 and 17, 3 at 3,5,...15, and zeros elsewhere.\n\nSo the output row 17 would be:\n\n0,1,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,1,0.\n\nNow, applying vertical mirroring: the rows processed are 11,13,15,17. Their mirrored rows are 7,5,3,1.\n\nSo row 7 would mirror row 11: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 5 mirrors row 13: [0,0,0,0,0,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 3 mirrors row 15: [0,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,3,0].\n\nRow 1 mirrors row 17: [0,1,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,1,0].\n\nAdditionally, any rows in between these mirrored rows would need to be filled with zeros, but according to the examples, the zeros are preserved.\n\nNow, combining all these, the output for the Test Input would have non-zero rows at 1,3,5,7,11,13,15,17.\n\nPutting this all together, the output should look like:\n\nRow 1: [0,1,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,1,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,3,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 11: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 13: [0,0,0,0,0,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 15: [0,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,3,0]\n\nRow 17: [0,1,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,1,0]\n\nThe other rows remain all zeros.\n\nBut looking at the examples, the output also includes filled rows between the mirrored ones. For example, in Example 0, the output has filled rows between the top and bottom mirrored rows. This suggests that the vertical mirroring also includes filling in the rows in between. So perhaps the pattern is not just mirroring the rows but also creating a vertical pattern.\n\nBut this complicates the matter. Given the time, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial hypothesis and generate the output based on row-wise mirroring of non-zero elements with filling every other position between original and mirror.\n\nSo applying this to the Test Input, the final answer would be structured as follows.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a grid of numbers, and the output is another grid with some changes. The key is to see how the input numbers are transformed into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0: The input has non-zero values at [1][1] (8), [1][3] (1), [3][1] (1), and [3][3] (2). The output seems to mirror these values in a symmetrical way. For instance, the 8 in the input's second row becomes an 8 at both ends of that row in the output. Similarly, the 1 and 2 in the fourth row are mirrored. Also, between these mirrored values, there are alternating 1s and other numbers. Maybe the pattern is to mirror the original values on both ends and fill the in-between positions with alternating numbers.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 3 at [1][17] and a 4 at [3][15], and a 1 at [3][13]. The output mirrors the 3s on the second row, the 4s and 1s on the fourth row. The in-between positions in the fourth row have alternating 1s. So similar to Example 0, the non-zero values are mirrored, and the spaces between them are filled with a sequence of numbers, perhaps alternating ones.\n\nExample 2 has 4, 3, 1, and 8 in certain positions. The output mirrors the 4s and 3s on the top and bottom rows, and the 1s and 8s in their respective rows. Again, the mirrored positions are filled with the same number, and between them, the numbers 3 or 8 are repeated.\n\nSo the general pattern seems to be: for each row in the input that has non-zero numbers, mirror those numbers at both ends of the row. Then, between the mirrored numbers, fill with a sequence of the same number that's in the original position, alternating if there are multiple values. For example, in Example 0, the row [0,8,0,1,...] becomes [0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1,...0,8,0]. So the 8 is mirrored, and between them are alternating 1s and 0s? Wait, no. The output shows that after the initial 8 and 1, it's 0,1,0,1... up to 8. Wait, the output for that row is [0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,8,0]. So the original 8 and 1 are at positions 1 and 3, then mirrored at positions 17 and 15? Wait, the length of the row is 19 elements. So starting from position 1 (8), and position 3 (1), then the mirrored positions would be 17 (since 19-1-1=17) for 8, and 15 (19-3-1=15) for 1. But in the output, the row has 8 at position 1 and 17, 1 at 3,5,7,...,15. So the 8 is mirrored at both ends, and between them, starting from the original 1's position, alternating 1s and 0s. Wait, but in the input, the row has 8 at position 1 and 1 at position 3. The output fills the row between 1 and 17 (the mirrored positions) with 0,1,0,1, etc. So perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero element in the input row is mirrored, and the spaces between them are filled with the next lower number in sequence. For example, in the first example, the original row has 8 and 1. Then between them, the output alternates 1 and 0. But in the second row of the output in Example 0, the row starts with 8, then 0,1,0,1..., ending with 8. Wait, maybe the numbers between the mirrored positions are filled with the same number as the original's next value. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output creates a symmetric pattern where each non-zero value in the input row is duplicated at the corresponding mirrored position. Then, the numbers between them are filled with a lower number in a pattern. For example, if the original row has 8 and 1, the mirrored positions would have 8 at both ends, and 1s in between, but in the first example's output, between the 8s, the 1 is repeated every other position. So perhaps the numbers between the mirrored positions are filled with the same value as the original non-zero number, but alternating with zeros. But in Example 1, the output row for the third row has 4 mirrored, and between them are 1s. So maybe the number between the mirrored positions is determined by the original numbers. For instance, in the input row, if there are two non-zero numbers, their positions are mirrored, and the in-between is filled with their value. Wait, in Example 0, the input row [0,8,0,1,...] becomes mirrored 8s and 1s, but the 1 is followed by alternating 1s. Maybe the pattern is that each non-zero value in the input row is mirrored, and the space between them is filled with that value, but spaced out. But in the first example, the 8 and 1 are mirrored, and the in-between has 0,1,0,1... So perhaps the 1 is propagated every other position between the original and mirrored positions.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output rows, they often have the same non-zero values as the input but mirrored, and then the rest of the row is filled with a pattern that alternates between the non-zero values. For example, in Example 0's second row of the output, after the initial 8 and 1, the next positions are 0,1,0,1, etc., until the mirrored 1 and 8. Wait, perhaps the rule is: for each row in the input, take the non-zero elements, mirror them symmetrically, and then fill the spaces between them with the same elements in order, repeating as necessary. For instance, in the input row [0,8,0,1,...], the mirrored positions would be 8 at both ends, and the 1 at positions 3 and 15. Then between them, the numbers 1,0,1,0... are filled? Or maybe the numbers between the mirrored elements are filled with the next lower number. For example, 8 is mirrored, then the next number is 1, and then 1 is repeated every other position until the mirrored 1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero element in the input row is mirrored, and then the entire row is transformed into a symmetric pattern where the values between the original and mirrored positions are filled with the same value as the original, but in a way that creates a diamond or symmetric shape. For instance, if the input has a non-zero at position i, it's also placed at position len(row)-i-1, and then the values in between are filled with the same number. But looking at Example 0's output row 1: [0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,8,0]. So between positions 1 (8) and 17 (8), there are 0s and 1s alternating. The original 1 is at position 3, and mirrored at position 15. So the 1s are placed at every even position between 3 and 15? Or maybe starting from the original position and mirroring, and filling the gaps with 1s alternating with 0s.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that each row is mirrored, and the non-zero elements in the input row are placed symmetrically. Then, for each non-zero element in the input, you mirror it, and then fill the spaces between them with a sequence of the same number. For example, if the input has 8 and 1, the output mirrors them and fills the in-between with 1s. But in Example 0's output row 1, after 8 and 1, the next positions are 0,1,0,1... So perhaps the 1 is placed every other position. Maybe the rule is that the original non-zero values are mirrored, and then the spaces between them are filled with alternating 1s (or the same as the original value) and 0s. But how does this vary between examples?\n\nIn Example 1's third row of input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,0,0]. The output for that row is [0,0,0,4,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,4,0,0,0]. So the original 1 and 4 are mirrored. The 4 is at positions 3 and 15 (original was position 15 in input, mirrored to position 3 in output?), and the 1 is at position 13 and mirrored to position 5. Then between 4 and 1, and 1 and 4, the numbers alternate 1 and 0. So perhaps the filling is done with the next lower number. 4 is mirrored, then 1s are filled between them.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the output rows, they seem to form diamond-like patterns. For example, in Example 0, the output rows 1 and 17 have 8s at the ends and 1s in between. The middle rows have 2s and 1s mirrored. Maybe the pattern is that each non-zero number in the input is the center of a diamond shape, and the numbers around it are decremented by 1 until they reach zero. But this might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a reflection across the vertical axis. For each row, the non-zero elements are mirrored left-right. For example, in Example 0's input row 1 has 8 at position 1 and 1 at position 3. The output mirrors these to position 17 and 15. Then, the row is filled with alternating 1s between the original and mirrored positions. So perhaps the rule is: mirror each non-zero element to the other side, then fill the row with the same numbers in a symmetric way. But how to determine the filling pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input row 5: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,...]. The output row 5 is [0,3,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,3,0]. So the 8 is mirrored, and the 3s are added at the ends. Wait, the input row 5 has an 8, but the output row 5 has 3s at positions 1 and 17. Where do those 3s come from? Oh wait, the input's row 1 in Example 2 is [0,4,0,3,...], which in the output becomes mirrored 4s and 3s. So maybe the rows are connected vertically as well. Wait, perhaps the pattern involves both vertical and horizontal symmetry. For example, the non-zero elements in the input are mirrored both horizontally (left-right) and vertically (up-down) to create a symmetric grid. Then, the numbers in between are filled in some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero element in the input creates a diamond shape. For instance, an 8 in the input would create a diamond with 8 at the center and decreasing numbers radiating out. But looking at the outputs, that doesn't seem to be the case. For example, in Example 0's output, the row with 8 and 1s doesn't show a diamond pattern but a symmetric horizontal line.\n\nAnother angle: The output grids have the same number of non-zero elements in corresponding mirrored rows. For example, in Example 0's output, rows 1 and 17 are the same. Similarly, rows 3 and 15 are the same. So perhaps each row is mirrored vertically, and the input's non-zero elements are placed in such a way that their mirrored counterparts create a symmetric pattern. Then, the numbers between are filled based on the original elements. For example, if a row in the input has a non-zero element, the output mirrors it in the corresponding row from the bottom. So the input's row 1 (second row) is mirrored in row 17 (second to last) in the output. Then, within each row, the elements are mirrored left-right, and filled with alternating values.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, the non-zero elements are in rows 1 and 3. In the output, rows 1 and 17 (mirroring row 1) and rows 3 and 15 (mirroring row 3) are the same. So vertical mirroring. Then, within each of these rows, the elements are mirrored horizontally and filled with numbers in between. For example, row 1 in input has 8 and 1. In output row 1, these are mirrored to both ends, and then filled with alternating 1s. So perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. For each non-zero element in the input grid, mirror its position both vertically (to the corresponding row from the bottom) and horizontally (to the opposite column).\n\n2. Then, for each such mirrored pair, fill the row with numbers between them. The numbers filled depend on the original element's value. For example, if the original element is 8, the filled numbers could be 1s, or perhaps a sequence based on the original number.\n\nBut how to determine what to fill between them. Looking at the examples:\n\n- In Example 0, row 1 in input has 8 and 1. The output row 1 has 8s at the ends and 1s alternating in between. So perhaps the 8 is the highest number, and between the 8s, the 1s are placed. The original 1 in row 1's input is in column 3. In the output, the row has 8 at columns 1 and 17, and 1s at columns 3,5,7,9,11,13,15. So every even index from 3 to 15 (but columns are 0-based? So columns 1 is index 0? Wait, the first element is index 0. Let me check the first example.\n\nWait, in the input for Example 0, the second row (row index 1) is [0,8,0,1,0,0,...]. The output row is [0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1,...0,8,0]. So positions 1 and 17 (assuming 0-based index) have 8. The 1 is at position 3, and mirrored at position 15. Then, the positions between 3 and 15 (columns 5,7,9,11,13) are also 1. So every other column starting from 3, incrementing by 2. So columns 3,5,7,...,15 are 1s. Similarly, the row with 2 in the input (row 3) has mirrored 2s and 1s, with the 2s at positions 3 and 15, and 1s at the ends. Wait, the input row 3 is [0,1,0,2,0,0,...], and the output row 3 is [0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0]. Wait, that doesn't fit. The mirrored positions would be column 3 and 15 (for 2), but the 1s are at positions 1 and 17. Oh, perhaps the original 1 in row 3 (input) is mirrored to position 17, and the 2 is mirrored to position 15. Then, the output row 3 has 1s at the ends and 2s mirrored. But then between them, there's nothing but zeros. So maybe the pattern isn't consistent. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for each row is constructed by taking the input row, mirroring its non-zero elements, and then filling the row with a pattern based on the highest number present. For example, in Example 0's row 1, the highest number is 8, so the row is filled with 8 at the ends and 1s in between. But where does the 1 come from? The input row has an 8 and a 1. Maybe the numbers in between are filled with the next lower numbers in sequence. Like 8, then 7, 6, etc., but that doesn't match the examples.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output grid is a mirror image of the input grid both horizontally and vertically. But that doesn't explain the numbers in between. Wait, in Example 0, the input has non-zero elements in rows 1 and 3, which in the output are mirrored to the bottom rows (rows 17 and 15). So vertical mirroring. Then, within each of those rows, the non-zero elements are mirrored horizontally. Then, between those mirrored elements, a pattern is filled. So the key steps could be:\n\n1. Mirror the entire grid vertically (so row i becomes row len(rows)-i-1).\n\n2. For each row, mirror the elements horizontally (so element j becomes element len(row)-j-1).\n\n3. Combine the original and mirrored elements, but perhaps with some priority (e.g., if both have non-zero, take the maximum or sum).\n\nBut looking at Example 0's input row 1, after mirroring, the output row 1 (original row 1) and row 17 (mirrored) would have the same elements. But in the output, row 17 is the same as row 1. So perhaps the output is created by mirroring both vertically and horizontally and then filling in between.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a symmetric grid where each non-zero element from the input is mirrored in all four quadrants, creating a symmetric pattern. Then, the in-between elements are filled based on the original values. For example, if the input has a non-zero at (i,j), the output places it at (i,j), (i, len-j-1), (len-i-1, j), (len-i-1, len-j-1). Then, the rows and columns between these points are filled with a pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, the non-zero elements form a kind of diamond or hourglass shape. For example, in Example 0's output, the rows 1 and 17 have 8s and 1s, rows 3 and 15 have 1s and 2s, etc. This suggests a diamond shape expanding from the center. But the input's non-zero elements are in certain positions that seed this diamond.\n\nWait, perhaps the input's non-zero elements are the \"seeds\" for a diamond pattern. Each seed is expanded into a diamond where each subsequent layer has a value one less than the previous. For example, a seed of 8 would create layers of 8, 7, 6, etc., radiating out. But looking at Example 0's output, the seed 8 is only in the top and bottom rows, and the 1s are spread in between. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by creating a symmetric pattern where each non-zero in the input is placed at mirrored positions and connected with lines of decreasing numbers. For example, if the input has a 8 at (1,1), the output would have 8 at (1,1) and mirrored positions, then 7s in the adjacent cells, 6s next, etc. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nLet me try to see what changes between input and output for each example.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput row 1 (0-based) is [0,8,0,1, ...] \u2192 Output row 1 is [0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,8,0].\n\nSo the 8 is mirrored to the end (position 17), and the 1 is mirrored to position 15. Then, between the 1 and its mirror (positions 3 and 15), the 1 is repeated every other position. So positions 3,5,7,9,11,13,15 are 1s. Similarly, between the 8s, there are 0s and 1s. But why 1s here?\n\nIn the input, row 3 has [0,1,0,2,...], and the output row 3 has [0,1,0,2,0,0,...,0,2,0,1,0]. So the 1 is mirrored to position 17, and the 2 is mirrored to position 15. But between them, there are zeros. So the filling pattern here is different from the first row.\n\nThis suggests that the filling depends on the original numbers. For example, in row 1 of input, the numbers 8 and 1 lead to filling 1s in between. In row 3, the numbers 1 and 2 don't lead to filling anything except their mirrored positions. So what's the difference between these two cases?\n\nMaybe the rule is that if a row has two non-zero numbers, they are mirrored, and the space between them is filled with alternating copies of the lower number. For example, in row 1 of Example 0, 8 and 1 are present. The lower number is 1, so the between positions are filled with 1s every other position. In row 3 of Example 0, the numbers are 1 and 2. The lower is 1, but the between positions are zeros. Wait, this doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the higher number is used. But 8 is higher than 1, and the filling is with 1s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the filling is done with the smaller number. In Example 0's row 1, 8 and 1, the filler is 1. In row 3, 1 and 2, the filler would be 1, but the output doesn't show that. So this idea doesn't hold.\n\nAnother angle: The filler numbers are the same as the leftmost non-zero in the input row. In Example 0's row 1, the leftmost non-zero is 8, but the filler is 1. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the filler is the sum of the two non-zero numbers. 8 +1=9, but no. The filler is 1. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the filler is the right non-zero number. In row 1 of Example 0, the right non-zero is 1, which is used as filler. In row 3, the right non-zero is 2, but there's no filler. Hmm, but in row 3's output, the filler is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the filler is only applied when the two non-zero numbers are in the same row and are the same. But in Example 0's row 1, they are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the filler depends on the column distance between the original non-zero elements. For example, in row 1, the 8 is at column 1 and the 1 is at column 3. The distance between them is 2. So the filler is placed every other column. But how does this lead to the 1s being filled.\n\nAlternatively, the filler is the same as the number to the right of the left non-zero. For example, in row 1 of Example 0, after the 8 (position 1), the next non-zero is 1 at position 3. So the filler is 1.\n\nBut how does this explain the filler in other examples?\n\nExample 1's input row 3 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,0,0]. The output row 3 is [0,0,0,4,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,4,0,0,0]. So the original 1 and 4 are at positions 13 and 15. Their mirrored positions are 3 and 5. The filler between 4 and 1 is 1s. So perhaps the filler is the smaller number. 1 is smaller than 4, and the filler is 1.\n\nIn Example 0's row 1, filler is 1 (smaller than 8). In row 3 of Example 0, the numbers are 1 and 2. Filler is 0. This contradicts the pattern. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the filler is the number that comes later in the row. For Example 0's row 1, after 8 comes 1, so filler is 1. In Example 1's row 3, after 4 comes 1 (but in the input, the 1 is before the 4). Wait, in input row 3 of Example 1, the 1 is at position 13 and 4 at 15. So in the output, the mirrored 4 is at position 3 and the 1 at 5. So the order is preserved? Maybe the filler is the number that comes after in the original row. So in Example 0's row 1, after 8 (position 1) comes 1 (position 3), so the filler is 1. In Example 1's row 3, after 4 (position 15) comes nothing, but in the input, the order is 1 then 4. So maybe the filler is the rightmost number. Or perhaps the filler is the number that's mirrored first. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the filler is the smaller of the two numbers. In Example 0's row 1, 1 is smaller than 8 \u2192 filler 1. In Example 1's row 3, 1 is smaller than 4 \u2192 filler 1. In Example 0's row 3, 1 and 2 \u2192 filler 1. But the output for Example 0's row 3 doesn't have filler. So that doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, the filler is the lower number only if there's space between the mirrored positions. For example, in Example 0's row 1, the mirrored positions for 8 are at 1 and 17 (distance 16), so there's a lot of space. Between them, the filler is 1. But in row 3, the mirrored positions are 1 and 17 for 1, and 3 and 15 for 2. The filler between 1 and 2's mirrored positions is zero. So maybe if the mirrored positions are close, there's no filler. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to find another pattern. Looking at the outputs, each non-zero in the input seems to generate a vertical and horizontal line of numbers. For example, in Example 0's input, the 8 at row 1, column 1 is mirrored to row 17, column 1 and column 17. Then, along row 1 and row 17, there are 8s at the ends and 1s in between. Similarly, the 1 in row 1, column 3 is mirrored to column 15, and between them, 1s are placed every other column. This suggests that the 8 and 1 in the input create horizontal lines with their values, and the vertical lines are created by mirroring the rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of horizontal and vertical mirroring, with the non-zero elements generating symmetric patterns both ways. For example, the 8 in row 1, column 1 is mirrored to row 17, column 1 and column 17, creating four 8s. But in the output, only two 8s exist in row 1 and 17. So perhaps only horizontal mirroring is done.\n\nAnother idea: The output grid is generated by taking the input grid and applying a vertical flip (mirroring rows) and a horizontal flip (mirroring columns), then combining the original and flipped grids, placing non-zero values where either had them. Then, filling in the gaps with a certain pattern. But looking at the examples, the output grids are larger than the input grids? No, the input and output grids have the same size (19x19). So perhaps the input is modified by mirroring each row horizontally and then vertically, and then filling in the gaps.\n\nAlternatively, the output grid is a diamond pattern where each non-zero in the input is the top of a diamond that expands downward. For example, an 8 in the input would create a diamond with 8 at the top, 7 in the next row, etc., but this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nLet me try to look for another approach. Perhaps the output is generated by creating a symmetric pattern where each non-zero number in the input is the center of a cross or plus sign. For example, the 8 in Example 0's row 1, column 1 generates a horizontal line of 8, 1, 1, ..., 8. But that's not a cross.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each row is created by taking the input row and its mirror, then combining them. For example, for row 1 in Example 0's input, the original is [0,8,0,1,...], and its mirror is [0,...,1,0,8,0]. The output row is a combination where the non-zeros are mirrored and filled with 1s in between. But how?\n\nAnother observation: The output grids seem to have a lot of symmetry, and the numbers in the output rows are often repeated in a pattern. For example, in Example 0's output row 1: 8,0,1,0,1,0,1..., which is a repeating 0,1 pattern. The same pattern is in other rows with 1s. So maybe the filler depends on the original number. For example, if the original number is 1, the filler is 1s; if it's 8, the filler is 1s (but why?). Alternatively, the filler is always 1s, but that's not the case in Example 2's output.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output row 5: [0,3,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,3,0]. The input row 5 has an 8. The output mirrors it to position 13 (since 19-5-1=13?), and adds 3s at the ends. Where do the 3s come from? The input's row 1 has a 4 and 3. Their output rows have 4s and 3s mirrored. So perhaps the 3s in row 5 of the output are coming from the input's row 1. This suggests that the pattern is not row-wise but involves the entire grid. This complicates things.\n\nPerhaps the numbers in the output are generated by combining the input numbers with their mirrored positions both horizontally and vertically. For example, each non-zero element in the input is mirrored in all four quadrants. Then, between those positions, certain numbers are filled. For example, if the input has an 8 at (1,1), it's mirrored to (1,17), (17,1), and (17,17). Then, the rows and columns between these points are filled with a pattern based on the original number. For example, 8 might create a diamond pattern expanding outwards.\n\nBut how does this explain the 1s in Example 0's row 1? Maybe the 8 and 1 are separate elements, each creating their own patterns. The 8's pattern is mirrored horizontally and vertically, and the 1's pattern is also mirrored, leading to overlapping areas where their patterns combine. For example, the 8's pattern might create a horizontal line of 8s at the ends of certain rows, while the 1's pattern creates a horizontal line of 1s in the middle rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of vertical and horizontal reflections of the input. Each non-zero element in the input is reflected across both axes, creating four copies. Then, the output fills the spaces between these copies with the same number. For example, an 8 in the input leads to four 8s in the output, and the space between them is filled with 8s. But this doesn't fit the examples where there are 1s in between.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to think of it as a simple transformation. Maybe each row in the input is transformed by mirroring the non-zero elements and then filling between them with alternating numbers. For example, for each non-zero element in the row, place its mirror, then fill the space between with the same number. But how to determine the filler.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is generated by taking the input row, mirroring it, and then for each pair of mirrored non-zero elements, the filler between them is the same as the original number. For example, if the input has 8 at position i and its mirror at position j, then the positions between i and j are filled with 8s. But in Example 0's row 1, the mirrored 8s are at positions 1 and 17. Filling between them with 8s would create a row full of 8s, which is not the case. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, the filler is 1s, regardless of the original number. But in Example 2's output, the filler between 3s is 3s. For example, the output row 1 in Example 2 is [0,4,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,4,0]. The 4s are mirrored, and between them are 3s. The input's row 1 has 4 and 3. So the filler is the next number in the row. Perhaps the filler is the number that comes after the first non-zero in the input row. For example, in Example 0's row 1: 8 then 1 \u2192 filler is 1. In Example 1's row 3: 4 then 1 \u2192 filler is 1. In Example 2's row 1:4 then 3 \u2192 filler is 3. This seems to fit. So the rule could be: For each row in the input, the non-zero elements are mirrored. Between the mirrored positions, fill with the second non-zero element in the row. If there's only one non-zero element, fill with 0s.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample 0's row 1 has two non-zero elements: 8 and 1. The filler is 1. So between the mirrored 8s and 1s, the filler is 1. Hence, the output row has 8s at the ends and 1s in between, alternating with 0s.\n\nExample 1's row 3 has non-zero elements 1 and 4. The filler is 4? No, the output filler is 1. Wait, this doesn't fit. In Example 1's input row 3, the non-zero elements are 1 (position 13) and 4 (position 15). The filler in the output is 1. So according to the previous idea, the filler would be 4, but it's 1. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the filler is the first non-zero element. In Example 0's row 1, the first non-zero is 8 \u2192 filler 8. But the output uses 1. So that's not correct.\n\nAnother observation: In the output, the filler between mirrored elements is the same as the second element in the input row. For example:\n\n- Example 0, row 1: elements 8 and 1 \u2192 filler 1.\n- Example 1, row 3: elements 1 and 4 \u2192 filler 1. But in the output, the filler is 1. So the filler is the first element's value? No. Because 1 is the first element in the input row.\n\nWait, in Example 1's row 3, the input row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,0,0]. The non-zero elements are 1 (position 13) and 4 (position 15). The output row is [0,0,0,4,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,4,0,0,0]. The mirrored positions are 4 at position 3 and 15, and 1 at position 5 and 13. The filler between 4 and 1 is 1. So the filler here is the second element's value (4 is first mirrored, then the 1 is next). But the filler is 1. So perhaps the filler is the second non-zero element's value.\n\nYes! So the rule could be:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n1. Identify all non-zero elements in order from left to right.\n\n2. Mirror each of them to their corresponding right position (so if an element is at position i, mirror it to position len(row) - i - 1).\n\n3. For each pair of mirrored elements (original and mirrored), fill the space between them with the value of the next non-zero element in the row. If there are no more elements, fill with the previous element's value.\n\nWait, in Example 0's row 1, the non-zero elements are 8 and 1. After mirroring, they become 8 at positions 1 and 17, 1 at positions 3 and 15. The filler between 8 and 1 is 1 (the next element's value). Then, between 1 and its mirror, perhaps filler is the next element, but there are no more. So between 3 and 15, filler is 1's value. Hence, alternating 1s.\n\nIn Example 1's row 3, non-zero elements are 1 and 4. Mirroring gives 1 at positions 5 and 13, 4 at positions 3 and 15. The filler between 4 and 1 is 1 (next element's value). Between 1 and its mirror, filler is 1's value. So the output row has 4 at 3 and 15, 1s between them (positions 5 to 13).\n\nIn Example 2's row 1, input has 4 and 3. Mirroring gives 4 at 1 and 17, 3 at 3 and 15. Filler between 4 and 3 is 3 (next element's value). Then between 3 and its mirror, filler is 3's value. So the output row has 4s at ends, 3s in between.\n\nThis seems to fit all examples.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- Mirror each non-zero element to the opposite end of the row (i.e., position i becomes position len(row) - i - 1).\n\n- For each pair of mirrored elements, fill the space between them (from the original to the mirrored position) with the value of the next non-zero element in the row. If there are no more elements, use the same value as the current element.\n\nWait, in Example 0's row 1, after mirroring 8 and 1, the filler between 8 and 1's original positions is 1. Then, between 1 and its mirror, the filler is 1 (since there's no next element). So the row becomes 8,0,1,0,1,0,1, etc., up to 8.\n\nIn Example 2's row 1, the non-zero elements are 4 and 3. After mirroring, filler between 4 and 3 is 3. Then between 3 and its mirror, filler is 3. So the row becomes 4,0,3,0,3,0,...3,0,4.\n\nBut in Example 2's output row 1, the row is [0,4,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,4,0], which fits.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each row, collect the non-zero elements in left-to-right order.\n\n2. Mirror each element to the corresponding position on the right.\n\n3. Between each consecutive pair of elements in this expanded list, fill the space with the value of the next element in the original list. For the last element, fill with its own value.\n\nWait, but how does this work for more than two elements?\n\nLooking at Example 0's row 1: elements are 8 and 1. After mirroring, the order is 8 (left), 1, mirrored 1, mirrored 8. But no, mirroring each element would place 8 at the left and right ends, and 1 at positions 3 and 15. Then, between 8 (position 1) and 1 (position 3), filler is 1. Between 1 (position 3) and its mirror (position 15), filler is 1. Between mirror 1 (position 15) and mirror 8 (position 17), filler is 8's value (but there's no next element, so use the same as current element, which is 1's mirror. Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, after mirroring, the row's non-zero elements are ordered as [8,1,1,8]. Then, between 8 and 1, filler is 1. Between 1 and 1, filler is 1. Between 1 and 8, filler is 8. But this doesn't match the example. The example's output between 8 and 1 is 0,1,0,1, etc. So maybe the filler is placed every other position.\n\nAlternatively, the filler is placed in every other position between the original and mirrored elements, starting with the first available spot. For example, between 8 (pos 1) and 1 (pos3), filler is placed at pos3,5,7,...15, which are 1s. But wait, the output has 0,1,0,1,... between 8 and 1's mirrored positions. So the filler is 1, placed every other position, starting from the original position.\n\nBut how to determine where the filler starts and steps.\n\nAlternatively, the filler is placed in every position between the original and mirrored elements. For example, between pos1 (8) and pos17 (8), the filler would be 1s in every position between. But in the example, it's 0,1,0,1,... So that's not the case.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming, but perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero element in the input row is mirrored, and then the entire row is filled with the next non-zero element in the row. For example:\n\n- If a row has elements A and B, then the mirrored row would have A and B at mirrored positions, and between them, the filler is B's value.\n\n- If a row has only element A, then the filler between mirrored A's is A's value.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 1, the filler between 8 and 1 is 1, and between 1 and 8 is 1 again. Which fits.\n\nIn Example 0's row 3 has elements 1 and 2. The filler between 1 and 2 is 2's value. So the output would have 1, 2, ... mirrored 2, 1. But the output row 3 for Example 0 is [0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0]. So between 1 and 2, there's 0. This contradicts the previous pattern. Hmm.\n\nSo this approach doesn't fit all examples. Maybe there's another rule. Let's think about the distance between the original elements and their mirrored positions. For example, in Example 0's row 1, the 8 is at position 1, mirrored to 17. The distance is 16. The 1 is at position 3, mirrored to 15. Distance is 12. Between 1's original and mirrored positions, the filler is 1 every other position. So between 3 and 15, there are 1s at positions 3,5,7,9,11,13,15. Which is every 2 steps. So the filler steps are 2. Similarly, between 8 and 1 in the same row, the filler starts at position 3, which is the 1's original position. So perhaps the filler is the value of the next non-zero element, and placed every other position between the current element and the next element.\n\nBut why in Example 0's row 3, the filler between 1 and 2 is 0. Maybe because there's no next element after 2? Or because 2 is the last element.\n\nAlternatively, the filler is applied only between the original element and its mirror, not between different elements. For example, each element and its mirror form a pair, and the space between them is filled with their value. But in Example 0's row 1, between the 8 and its mirror (positions 1 and 17), the filler is 1s. But 8's value is 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the filler between an element and its mirror is the same as the element's value. But in Example 0's row 1, between 8 and its mirror, the filler is 1s, which is the value of the next element.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n\nLooking at the test input, the non-zero elements are in rows 15, 17, and possibly others. Let's list them:\n\nRow 15 (0-based): [0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 17: [0,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 11: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 13: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nSo the non-zero elements are:\n\n- Row 11, position 5: 8.\n\n- Row 13, positions 5:4 and 7:8.\n\n- Row 15, positions 1:3 and 3:2.\n\n- Row 17, positions 1:1 and 3:3.\n\nNow, applying the pattern from the training examples, each of these elements should be mirrored in their row and possibly filled with their next non-zero element's value.\n\nFor example, row 11 has an 8 at position 5. Its mirrored position is 13 (since 19-5-1=13). So the output row 11 should have 8 at positions 5 and 13. Between them, the filler would be the next non-zero element's value. But there are no other elements in this row. So filler would be 8's own value. But in Example 2's row 5, which has an 8, the output mirrored it and filled with 3s (from the input's row 1). This suggests that vertical mirroring is also involved. So perhaps the filler is taken from other rows.\n\nAlternatively, the filler depends on the vertical position. For example, row 11's 8 is mirrored to row 7 (since 19-11-1=7), and the filler is taken from other rows. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the test input's non-zero elements are mirrored both horizontally and vertically, creating a symmetric pattern. Then, the filler is determined by the original elements' values.\n\nFor example, the 8 in row 11, column 5 is mirrored to row 7, column 5 and column 13. The 4 in row 13, column 5 is mirrored to row 5, column 5 and column 13. The 8 in row 13, column 7 is mirrored to row 5, column 7 and column 11. Then, the filler between these mirrored positions is determined by the original values.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the pattern I think best fits the training examples: For each row, non-zero elements are mirrored to their opposite positions, and the filler between them is the value of the next non-zero element in the row. For the last element, filler is its own value.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow 11: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,...]. Mirrored 8 at position 13. Between 5 and 13, filler is 8's own value (since no next element). So output row 11 would have 8s at 5 and 13, with 8s in between. But the training examples don't have such cases. For example, Example 2's row 5 has an 8 and filler 3s. So this suggests that the filler may come from other rows.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the test input has multiple non-zero elements in different rows, the output must mirror them both horizontally and vertically, and fill between them based on the closest non-zero elements.\n\nBut without a clear pattern from the training examples, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to construct the test output as follows:\n\n- For each non-zero element in the input, mirror it horizontally and vertically.\n\n- Fill between the mirrored elements with the same value as the original.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow 15 (input): [0,3,0,2,0,...]. Mirrored horizontally would have 3 at position 17-1-1=17-1=16? Wait, index starts at 0. For position 1 in row 15, mirrored is 17. For position 3, mirrored is 15. So row 15 in output would have 3 at positions 1 and 17, 2 at 3 and 15. Between them, filler would be 2 (next element). So between 3 and 15, filler 2, but the input's row 15 has no other elements. So maybe filler is 0. This is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, based on the training examples, each non-zero element is mirrored, and the filler is the next non-zero element's value. If no next element, filler is the same as the current.\n\nIn test row 15: elements 3 and 2. Mirrored to positions 17 and 15. Filler between 3 and 2 is 2. Between 2 and mirrored 2, filler is 2. Between mirrored 2 and mirrored 3, filler is 3. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to apply the same pattern observed in the examples: mirror each non-zero element in the row and fill between them with the next non-zero element's value. If there's no next element, use the same value.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow 11: 8 at position 5. Mirrored to 13. Between 5 and 13, filler is 8. So the output row would have 8s at 5 and 13, and 8s between them. But looking at Example 2's row 5, the input had an 8 and the output filler was 3s. So this suggests that the filler depends on other rows. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the filler is determined by the vertical position. For example, the 8 in row 11 of the test input may be part of a diamond pattern with other elements. However, without a clear pattern from the training examples, I'll have to make an educated guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to generate the output based on the following pattern:\n\nEach non-zero element in the input is mirrored both horizontally and vertically. The filler between the mirrored elements is determined by the next non-zero element in the same row. If there are no more elements, filler is 0.\n\nFor the test input, the output rows would have mirrored elements from each non-zero in the input, filled with the next element's value.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow 15 in the input has 3 and 2. Mirrored to positions 17 and 15. Filler between 3 and 2 is 2. Between 2 and mirrored 2, filler is 2. Between mirrored 2 and mirrored 3, filler is 3.\n\nBut this is speculative. Given the examples, I'll proceed to generate the output in the same style.",
