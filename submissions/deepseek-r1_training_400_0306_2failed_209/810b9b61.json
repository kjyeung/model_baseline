        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a grid of 0s and 1s, and the output replaces some 1s with 3s. The question is, which 1s get replaced?\n\nLet me look at Example 0 first. The input has several regions of 1s. In the output, certain areas of 1s are turned into 3s. For instance, in the third row of Example 0's input, there's a block like:\n\n1,1,1,1\n1,0,0,1\n1,1,1,1\n\nIn the output, all those 1s in the border are 3s, but the inner 0s remain. Wait, but the output for that part in Example 0 shows 3s where the 1s were on the perimeter. So maybe it's replacing the outer edges of a rectangle of 1s with 3s, leaving the inner parts as 0s if they were 0. But how does that work exactly?\n\nLooking at another part of Example 0: the input has a 3x3 square in the middle. The output replaces the border 1s with 3s but keeps the inner 0 as 0. So, perhaps the pattern is that when there's a rectangle of 1s forming a border (like a hollow square), those 1s become 3s. But how do we determine which 1s are part of the border?\n\nWait, maybe it's about detecting the perimeter of solid regions. Alternatively, maybe any 1 that is on the edge of a connected region is turned into a 3. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has a 3x3 square where the middle is 0. The output replaces the outer 1s (the border) with 3s. So in the fourth row, the input is [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. The output becomes [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,...]. Then the next row is [0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,...] which becomes [0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,...]. So here, the 1s that form a square (like a hollow square) are replaced by 3s. The inner 0 remains. So this suggests that any rectangular border (hollow) made of 1s is converted to 3s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the input has a 5x3 (rows x columns?) structure. Let's see: the input has rows like [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0], then [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], then again the 1s. The output replaces all the 1s in the borders with 3s, leaving the inner 0s. So the pattern seems to be that any rectangle (hollow) made of 1s is replaced by 3s. So if there's a rectangle where the perimeter is 1s and the inside is 0s, then the perimeter 1s become 3s. Also, if the entire rectangle is filled with 1s (like a solid block), then the outer 1s become 3s, but the inner ones remain 1s? Wait, in Example 0, the first block in row 2-4 and columns 2-5 is a solid block of 1s (like a 3x4 rectangle filled with 1s). The output replaces all of them with 3s. Wait, the input here for Example 0's first big block:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut the output for those rows is:\n[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWait, so the first block in Example 0 is a 3x4 block where the middle two rows have 0s in the middle. So the 1s that are on the perimeter of this shape (which is a hollow rectangle) are replaced by 3s. But the original shape here is a hollow rectangle. Then the output replaces the 1s forming the perimeter with 3s. But in another part of the same example, the row 10 has [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0], which becomes [3,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]. Those 1s are solid blocks (like a horizontal line of 3 1s, then four 1s), and all are replaced by 3s. Hmm. So maybe the rule is that any contiguous block of 1s (even if they are solid) have their borders replaced by 3s. Wait, but how would that work for a solid block. For example, a 2x2 square of 1s. If all are 1s, then their borders are the outermost layer, but since it's 2x2, all are borders. So they all become 3s. But if it's a 3x3 solid square, then the outermost layer becomes 3s and the inner 1s remain? But in Example 0, there's a 3x4 solid block (rows 2-4, columns 2-5 are all 1s except for two 0s in row 3). Wait no, in the input of Example 0, row 3 is [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, ...]. So the middle of that block has 0s, making it a hollow rectangle. So the 3s replace the perimeter 1s. So the pattern seems to be that whenever there's a hollow rectangle (i.e., a rectangle where the 1s form a border with 0s inside), the 1s on the border become 3s. But in the case where the rectangle is filled with 1s (solid), perhaps the entire rectangle is replaced by 3s? Or maybe the outer layer is replaced by 3s and the inner 1s remain 1s? But looking at Example 0's row 10: the input is [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0], and the output is [3,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,...]. The input here is a line of three 1s followed by a line of four 1s. These are not hollow. So the entire 1s are turned into 3s. So maybe the rule is that any contiguous horizontal or vertical line of 1s (even if they form a solid block) are replaced by 3s. That doesn't seem right. Or perhaps the rule is that any 1 that is part of a perimeter (i.e., adjacent to a 0 either above, below, left, or right) gets replaced by 3. Let me test this idea.\n\nTake Example 0. The first big block. The 1s on the edges of that block would be adjacent to 0s. The inner 1s (if there are any) would be surrounded by other 1s. But in Example 0's input, the middle row of the first block (row 3) has 1s in positions 2 and 5, but 0s in positions 3 and 4. So the 1s in row 3 are at the ends, adjacent to 0s. So those would be turned into 3s. Similarly, in a solid block, all the 1s on the edge would be adjacent to 0s, so they become 3s, but the inner 1s (if any) would stay as 1s. But in the output of Example 0's first block, all the 1s in the block are replaced by 3s. Wait, but that block is 3 rows tall and 4 columns wide. So maybe if the block is a solid rectangle, all 1s are converted to 3s. But in the case where it's a hollow rectangle (like a frame), the perimeter 1s are converted to 3s. So perhaps the rule is: any 1 that is part of a rectangle (hollow or solid) is converted to 3, but other 1s (like diagonal lines, or single 1s) remain 1. But how do you determine what's a rectangle?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 1 that is part of a straight horizontal or vertical line of at least two 1s, and those 1s form the edge of a rectangle. Maybe it's about finding the outermost layers of connected regions. For example, in a solid block, the entire block is considered a rectangle, so all 1s become 3s. But that's conflicting with Example 0's row 10 where three 1s in a row (like a horizontal line) are all turned into 3s. Similarly, the four 1s in the same row are all 3s. So maybe the rule is to replace all 1s that are part of a rectangular region, whether hollow or solid. So any 1 that is part of a rectangle (as a perimeter or solid) becomes 3. Then, any 1 that is not part of a rectangle (like diagonal lines, single 1s, or irregular shapes) remains 1. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output: in the fifth row, the input has [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which becomes [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So three 1s in a row, which could form part of a rectangle. But in the input, that row is part of a 3x3 square where the middle is a 0. So the perimeter is replaced by 3s. The inner 0 remains. So in that case, the 1s on the perimeter of the rectangle are replaced by 3s. The same in Example 2: the middle row of the input's block is [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], which becomes [0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]. The 1s here are the ends of a horizontal line, which form the left and right edges of a rectangle, so they become 3s. \n\nSo perhaps the transformation is to replace all 1s that form the perimeter of a rectangular region (hollow or solid) to 3s, while leaving the inner 1s (in solid rectangles) as 1s. Wait, but in Example 0's row 10, all 1s are turned into 3s, even in a solid line. For example, the input row is [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0], and the output is all 3s. So that's a horizontal line of three 1s and a horizontal line of four 1s. Since they are lines (i.e., 1x3 and 1x4 rectangles), their entire perimeter (which in a 1-row high rectangle would be the entire line) is replaced by 3s. So for a rectangle that's 1 row high, all the 1s are perimeter, so they become 3s. \n\nBut then, in Example 1's output, there's a part where in the 8th row, the input has [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0], and the output remains the same. So the 1s here are part of a structure that's not a rectangle. For example, the 1s in columns 4,9,11,12. Since these 1s are not forming a rectangle, they remain as 1s. So the transformation only affects 1s that are part of a rectangular perimeter. \n\nSo the pattern is: identify all 1s that are part of a rectangular perimeter (either hollow or solid) and replace them with 3s. All other 1s remain as 1s. \n\nNow, how to detect such perimeters. For a rectangle, it's a region that can be defined by a top-left and bottom-right coordinate, forming a rectangle. The perimeter would be the cells on the top, bottom, left, and right edges of this rectangle. For solid rectangles, all cells are part of the perimeter (if the rectangle is 1 row or column thick). For example, a 1x3 line is a rectangle with height 1, so all cells are perimeter. But a 2x3 rectangle would have the top and bottom rows as perimeter, and the left and right columns (but in a 2x3, the middle columns are part of the perimeter as well). \n\nAlternatively, the perimeter of a rectangle is all cells that are on the outer edges. So in a solid rectangle, the perimeter is the outermost layer. For example, a 3x3 solid rectangle has a perimeter of the first and third rows and the first and third columns, with the center being an inner cell. So in that case, the perimeter 1s would be replaced by 3s, but the inner 1 remains as 1. But in the training examples, there's no case like that. Let's check.\n\nLooking at Example 0, in row 7 of the input, there's a part:\n\n[0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nThe output becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nSo the 1s in columns 6-9 (indices 6-9) are replaced by 3s. So this seems to be a horizontal line of four 1s (since it's in the same row). So these 1s form a 1x4 rectangle, so their perimeter (the entire line) is replaced by 3s. \n\nIn row 10 of Example 0's input, the entire first three elements are 1s, replaced by 3s. So they form a horizontal line (1x3 rectangle), so all replaced. \n\nSo the key seems to be that any contiguous 1s that form a straight line (either horizontal or vertical) of at least two cells, and are part of a rectangle (could be a line, which is a rectangle with height or width 1). Then, all 1s in such lines are replaced by 3s. Wait, but in Example 0's row 12:\n\nInput: [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nOutput: [3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0]\n\nHere, the input has 1s at positions 0 and 2, and then a group of four 1s at positions 10-13. The output for these are 3s. So the individual 1s in positions 0 and 2 (assuming they are part of vertical lines?) are replaced by 3s. But wait, the input row 12 in Example 0:\n\nOriginal: [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nSo the first two 1s are in columns 0 and 2. Are they part of vertical lines? Let's check the columns above and below. In the input, maybe these 1s form vertical lines. For example, the column 0 in row 10-13: rows 10 has 1s in column 0 (as per input row 10: [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0] \u2014 wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the rows and columns. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the input in Example 0 is 15x15. The output for row 12 (0-based?) would be row index 12. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input row 12 (Example 0): \n\n[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nOutput row 12: \n\n[3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\nSo the 1s in columns 0 and 2 of row 12 are replaced by 3s. How do these fit into a rectangle? Looking at the surrounding rows, perhaps these are part of vertical lines. For example, if in column 0 of rows 10, 11, 12, 13, there are 1s. Let's check the input rows:\n\nRow 10: [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0] \u2014 column 0 is 1.\n\nRow 11: [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2014 column 0 is 1.\n\nRow 12: [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0] \u2014 column 0 is 1.\n\nRow 13: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0] \u2014 column 0 is 1.\n\nSo column 0 has 1s in rows 10-13. So this forms a vertical line of 4 cells. So the 1s here form a vertical line, hence a rectangle (1 column wide, 4 rows tall). So the perimeter of this vertical line is the entire line (since it's 1 column wide), so all 1s in column 0 from rows 10-13 are replaced by 3s. Similarly, the 1s in column 2 of row 12 (input) may be part of another structure. Wait, in row 12, column 2 is 1 in the input. Looking at rows 10-13 for column 2:\n\nRow 10: column 2 is 1 (input row 10 is [1,1,1,...]).\n\nRow 11: column 2 is 1 (input row 11: [1,0,1,...]).\n\nRow 12: column 2 is 1.\n\nRow 13: column 2 is 1 (input row 13: [1,1,1,...]).\n\nSo column 2 has 1s in rows 10-13, forming a vertical line. So all these 1s are replaced by 3s. So in row 12's output, the first and third elements (columns 0 and 2) are 3s. \n\nSo the pattern is that any 1 that is part of a vertical or horizontal line (i.e., a straight line of two or more 1s) is replaced by 3. But wait, in Example 1's output, the 1s in row 3, columns 4-6 are replaced by 3s, which are part of a 3x3 hollow square. So perhaps the rule is to replace all 1s that form the borders of a rectangle (hollow or solid), but not the inner parts if it's hollow.\n\nBut how to determine whether a 1 is part of a rectangle's perimeter. Maybe the 1s are part of the perimeter if they are on the edge of a rectangular region. For example, in a hollow square, the perimeter is the outer 1s. In a solid square, the perimeter is the outer layer. So the algorithm would need to detect all such perimeters and replace those 1s with 3s.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be to replace all 1s that are part of a rectangle (either hollow or solid) with 3s. So any 1 that is part of a rectangular region (regardless of position in the rectangle) gets replaced. But that doesn't fit with the examples. For instance, in a solid rectangle, all 1s would be replaced, which aligns with Example 0's row 10 and 11.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 14, the output is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0]. The input row 14 was [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]. So the four 1s are replaced by 3s. This is a horizontal line of four 1s. So they form a 1x4 rectangle, and all are replaced by 3s.\n\nIn the test input, the first row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1]. So a horizontal line of five 1s. According to the pattern, these should all be replaced by 3s.\n\nLooking at another part of the test input:\n\nRow 1: [0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow 2: [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow 3: [0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]\n\nThese rows seem to form a hollow square on the left side (columns 1-4, rows 1-3). For example, row 1 has 1s in columns 1-4. Row 2 has 1s at columns 1 and 4, row 3 has 1s in columns 1-4. So this is a 3x4 hollow rectangle. The perimeter 1s (the borders) would be replaced by 3s. So the output for these rows would have 3s in those positions.\n\nThen, in the same rows, there are 1s in columns 7 and 11 (for row 1, 7 is 1, 11 is 1). Let's see:\n\nRow 1's input: columns 7 is 1, and columns 8-10 are 0, 0, 0, and column 11 is 1. So that's a single 1 in column 7 and 11, which are not part of a line. So those 1s remain as 1s. But wait, no: in row 1, the input has [0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]. So columns 7 and 11 are 1s. Are those part of a vertical line?\n\nLooking at rows 1, 2, 3 for column 7:\n\nRow 1: 1\n\nRow 2: 1\n\nRow 3: 1\n\nSo column 7 has 1s in rows 1-3. So that's a vertical line of three 1s. So these would be replaced by 3s. Similarly, column 11 in rows 1-3 is 1 in row 1, 1 in row 2, 1 in row 3. So vertical line of three 1s. So those would be replaced by 3s. \n\nBut wait, in row 1's input, columns 7 and 11 are 1s. So in row 1, the 1s in columns 7 and 11 would be part of vertical lines. So in the output, they would be 3s. But the rest of the row's 1s (columns 1-4) form a hollow rectangle, so their perimeter 1s become 3s. So for row 1, the output would be [0,3,3,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3], perhaps?\n\nBut wait, let's think again. The hollow rectangle in columns 1-4, rows 1-3. The perimeter would be columns 1 and 4, and rows 1 and 3. But in row 2, columns 1 and 4 are 1s (since it's hollow), so they are part of the perimeter and would be replaced by 3s. The middle columns 2 and 3 are 0s. So the output for row 2 would be [0,3,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3], etc.\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input's rows:\n\nTest input row 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nThe 1s in columns 7-11 (five 1s in a row) are a horizontal line. So they should all be replaced by 3s. So the output row 0 would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nRow 1: [0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]\n\nThe 1s in columns 1-4 form a hollow rectangle. So the perimeter 1s (all of them in rows 1 and 3, and columns 1 and 4) are replaced by 3s. But row 1 of the input is part of the top of the hollow rectangle. So columns 1-4 in row 1 are all 1s. So in the output, they would be replaced by 3s. Similarly, columns 7 and 11 (vertical lines) would be 3s. So output row 1: [0,3,3,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3].\n\nRow 2: [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]\n\nThis is the middle row of the hollow rectangle. The 1s are in columns 1 and 4. So in the output, these become 3s. Columns 7 and 11 are vertical lines, so they become 3s. So output row 2: [0,3,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3].\n\nRow 3: [0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]\n\nThis is the bottom row of the hollow rectangle, so all 1s in columns 1-4 become 3s. Columns 7 and 11 are 3s. Output row 3: [0,3,3,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3].\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nThe 1s in columns 7,8,10,11. Let's see if they form a rectangle. Columns 7-11: but in this row, it's [1,1,0,1,1]. So 1s at positions 7,8,10,11. Not a solid line. However, maybe columns 7-8 are a horizontal line (two 1s), then after a 0, another two 1s. These could form two separate horizontal lines. But according to the pattern, any horizontal line of two or more 1s would be replaced by 3s. So the 1s at 7 and 8 (two in a row) become 3s. The 1s at 10 and 11 (two in a row) become 3s. So the row becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,3,3].\n\nRow 5: all zeros, remains the same.\n\nRow 6: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe 1s in columns 1 and 2 form a horizontal line of two. So replaced by 3s. Output: [0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nThe 1s in columns 4-8 form a horizontal line of five. All replaced by 3s. Output: [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0].\n\nRow 8: [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1]\n\nThe 1s are at columns 1,4,8,11. Let's check vertical lines:\n\nColumn 1: rows 6 has 1s (row 6 is [0,1,1,...], columns 1 and 2. Row 8 has 1 in column 1. So perhaps column 1 has a 1 in row 6,7,8? Let's see:\n\nRow 6: columns 1 and 2 are 1s.\n\nRow 7: column 4-8 are 1s.\n\nRow 8: column 1,4,8,11.\n\nSo column 1 has 1 in row 6 and 8. Not a vertical line. So the 1 in column 1, row 8 is not part of a vertical line, so remains 1. \n\nColumn 4: row 7 has 1s in columns 4-8. Row 8 has a 1 in column 4. So row 7 is 1s in columns 4-8, row 8's column 4 is 1. So possible vertical line in column 4 from row 7 to 8? If that's a vertical line of two 1s, then they become 3s. \n\nSimilarly, column 8 in row 8 has 1. Let's see row 7's column 8 is 1 (part of the horizontal line). So column 8 in row 7 and 8: both 1s. So vertical line of two, replaced by 3s. \n\nColumn 11 in row 8 is 1. Let's see if there's a vertical line there. Looking at rows above and below:\n\nRow 0's column 11 is 1 (part of the horizontal line in row 0). Rows 1-3 have 1s in column 11 (vertical line). Row 4's column 11 is 1. So from rows 0-4, column 11 has 1s. Then row 8's column 11 is 1. But there are rows 5-7 with 0s. So not a continuous vertical line. So perhaps the 1 in row 8, column 11 is not part of a vertical line, so remains 1. \n\nSo in row 8, the 1s at columns 4 and 8 are part of vertical lines (row 7 and 8), so replaced by 3s. The 1s in columns 1 and 11 are isolated, so remain 1. So output row 8: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,1].\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n\nColumns 4 and 8 have 1s. Check vertical lines:\n\nColumn 4: row 7-9 (rows 7 has 1, row 8 has 1, row 9 has 1). So vertical line of three 1s. So replaced by 3s. Column 8: rows 7-9? Row 7's column 8 is 1 (as part of the horizontal line in row 7). Row 8's column 8 is 1. Row 9's column 8 is 1. So vertical line of three. So columns 4 and 8's 1s are replaced by 3s. So output row 9: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nRow 10: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nThe 1s in columns 4-8 form a horizontal line of five. All replaced by 3s. Output row 10: [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0].\n\nRow 11: all zeros, remains the same.\n\nPutting it all together, the output should replace all 1s that are part of horizontal or vertical lines (i.e., contiguous in a straight line) with 3s. So any group of 1s that form a straight line (horizontal or vertical) of at least two cells are replaced by 3s. Single 1s or diagonal arrangements remain 1s.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input row 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 1: [0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1] \u2192 columns 1-4 (4 1s in a row \u2192 3s), column 7 and 11 (vertical lines \u2192 3s) \u2192 [0,3,3,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow 2: [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1] \u2192 columns 1 and 4 (vertical part of hollow rectangle \u2192 3s), column 7 and 11 (vertical lines \u2192 3s) \u2192 [0,3,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow 3: [0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1] \u2192 same as row 1 \u2192 [0,3,3,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1] \u2192 columns 7-8 (two 1s \u2192 3s), 10-11 (two 1s \u2192 3s) \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,3,3]\n\nRow 5: all zeros \u2192 same.\n\nRow 6: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns 1-2 \u2192 3s \u2192 [0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0] \u2192 columns 4-8 \u2192 five 1s \u2192 3s \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1] \u2192 column 4 (part of vertical line rows 7-9 \u2192 3), column 8 (part of vertical line rows 7-9 \u2192 3), others remain \u2192 [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,1]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] \u2192 columns 4 and 8 (vertical lines \u2192 3s) \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow 10: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0] \u2192 columns 4-8 \u2192 3s \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow 11: all zeros \u2192 same.\n\nSo the final output would have these changes. Let's verify against the examples. For instance, in row 8, the 1s at columns 1 and 11 are isolated, so they remain 1. The others (columns 4 and 8) are part of vertical lines, so become 3s.\n\nThus, the answer should follow this pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a 2D grid of 0s and 1s, and the output replaces some 1s with 3s. The question is, what's the rule for when a 1 becomes a 3?\n\nLet's start with Example 0. The input has several regions of 1s. The output changes certain 1s to 3s. Let's compare the input and output rows. For instance, in the third row of input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0] becomes [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. So the four 1s in positions 2-5 are changed to 3s. Similarly, in row 7 of the input, there's a 1 that's part of a larger structure. Wait, in row 7 of input, the section is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], which becomes [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. So the four 1s starting at position 6 are replaced by 3s.\n\nLooking at these, it seems like the 3s are replacing 1s that form the perimeter or outline of a rectangle. For example, in Example 0's third input row, the 1s form a square, and all of them are turned into 3s. Wait, but in the third row of input, the 1s are in positions 2,3,4,5, which is a horizontal line. Hmm, maybe not a square. Wait, maybe the 3s are replacing 1s that are part of closed loops or rectangles. Let me check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The fourth row has [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the output becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So here, the 1s at positions 4 and 6 (0-based) are replaced by 3s. But those are part of a 3x3 square? Wait, in the input, the fourth row is part of a structure like:\n\nRow3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo that's a 3x3 square (maybe a hollow one?), but in the output, the perimeter of the square (the outer 1s) are replaced by 3s, but the middle remains 0. Wait, but in the output of row3, the first three 1s (positions 4-6) become 3s. Row4's 1s at positions 4,6 become 3s. Row5's 1s at 4-6 become 3s. So the square's outline is 3s. So perhaps any 1 that is part of a rectangle's border is turned into a 3. So, the outline of a rectangle (the perimeter) becomes 3s, and the inner 1s (if any) stay as 1s? Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, in Example0, there's a 4x4 square? Let's look again.\n\nIn Example0's input, the third row is [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...] which is four 1s. Then the fourth row is [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, ...]. So that's a hollow square: the perimeter is 1s. In the output, all those 1s become 3s, including the corners. So the entire perimeter is replaced. So the pattern might be that any 1 that is part of the outline of a rectangle (the border) is replaced by 3. But how to determine the rectangle's borders?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replacing 1s that form the outline of a rectangle with maximum possible area. Or perhaps, any contiguous block of 1s that form a rectangle (even if the rectangle is not filled) are replaced by 3s. Wait, but in Example0, the first square in row2-4 is a filled square. Wait, row2: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...], row3: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, ...], row4: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...]. Wait, that's a 3-row tall structure. The first and third rows have four 1s in a row, and the middle row has 1s on the ends and 0s in the middle. So that's a hollow rectangle, 3 rows tall and 4 columns wide. In the output, all the 1s in that structure are turned into 3s. So maybe any 1 that is part of a hollow or filled rectangle's perimeter is turned into 3. But how about filled rectangles? For example, a filled rectangle would have all the cells as 1s, including the inner ones. If the perimeter is the outline, then the inner 1s would stay as 1s. Wait, but in Example0's input, the first structure (rows 2-4) is a hollow rectangle. So all the 1s in that structure are part of the perimeter, so they get turned into 3s. Similarly, the next structure in rows 7-10: in row7 of the input, there's [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...], then row8 and 9 have 1s on the edges. So that's another hollow rectangle. All those 1s become 3s. \n\nIn Example2, the input has a structure in rows 2-4: [0,1,1,1,1,1,0...], then [0,1,0,0,0,1,0...], then [0,1,1,1,1,1,0...]. So a 3-row tall, 5-column wide hollow rectangle. All those 1s in the perimeter are turned into 3s. The inner 0s remain 0. So perhaps any 1 that is part of the perimeter (border) of a rectangle is replaced by 3, while the inner 1s (if any) remain as 1. Wait, but in Example0, the first structure is hollow, so all 1s are perimeter. But what if there's a filled rectangle? Let's say a 3x3 filled square. Then the perimeter would be the outer ring of 1s, and the center 1 would be inner. Then according to the pattern, the perimeter 1s become 3s, and the inner remains 1. But in the training examples, I don't see such a case. However, in Example1, the fourth row of the input has [1,0,1], which suggests that maybe the center is 0, so that's a hollow rectangle, and all the 1s are part of the perimeter, hence replaced by 3s. \n\nWait, in Example1, the fourth row of input is [0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], and in the output, it's [0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. The 1s at positions 4 and 6 are replaced by 3s, but the 1 in position 10 is left as 1. So why is that? Let's look at the surrounding rows. Row3 of input is [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], which becomes [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. Row4 becomes [3,0,3], and row5 becomes [3,3,3]. So that's a 3-row tall, 3-column wide hollow rectangle (positions 4-6 in rows 3-5). So all the perimeter 1s are replaced by 3s. The 1 in position 10 of row4 is part of another structure. Let's look at row3, the 1 at position 10: in row3, it's [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. So that's a 1 at position 10. The next rows (4 and 5) have 1s at position 10. So row3: 1 at 10, row4: 1 at 10, row5: 0 at 10. So that's a vertical line of three 1s? Wait, maybe that's a vertical line, but not part of a rectangle. So that's just a vertical line, which isn't part of a rectangle's perimeter. Hence, those 1s are not replaced by 3s. So the rule seems to be: 1s that are part of the perimeter (border) of a rectangle are replaced by 3s. Other 1s remain as 1s.\n\nSo the task is to find all 1s that lie on the perimeter of a rectangle and replace them with 3s. Now, how do we define the perimeter of a rectangle here? A rectangle here would be a contiguous block of 1s forming a rectangular shape. The perimeter would be the outermost cells of the rectangle. For example, in a filled rectangle, the perimeter is the outer ring, and the inner cells remain 1. In a hollow rectangle, all the 1s are part of the perimeter.\n\nSo the algorithm would be: for each cell in the grid, if the cell is a 1 and is on the perimeter of a rectangular region, replace it with 3. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nBut how do we determine if a 1 is on the perimeter of a rectangle? Let's think. A cell is on the perimeter if it is on the edge of a rectangular region. So for a given 1 at (i,j), check if it's on the top, bottom, left, or right edge of a rectangle. But how to find the rectangles? Because the grid can have multiple rectangles.\n\nAn alternative approach: For each 1, check if it is on the border of a rectangular region. To determine if a cell is on the perimeter of its region, we can check if it's on the top, bottom, left, or right edge of the rectangle that it belongs to.\n\nBut how to find the rectangle for each cell? For example, a cell (i,j) that's part of a rectangle would have the rectangle defined by the maximum and minimum rows and columns of the connected region. Wait, but connected regions can be of any shape, not necessarily rectangles. So perhaps the rectangles are the axis-aligned rectangles formed by contiguous 1s. So perhaps the algorithm is: for each 1, check if it's on the edge of the minimal enclosing rectangle of its connected region.\n\nWait, but connected regions can be non-rectangular. For example, an L-shaped region. The minimal enclosing rectangle would be the smallest rectangle that contains all the cells of the connected region. Then, any cell in that rectangle that is on the perimeter (the borders of the rectangle) would be replaced by 3. But if the connected region isn't a perfect rectangle, then the minimal enclosing rectangle's perimeter cells may not all be 1s. Wait, that's a complication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rectangles are only perfect solid rectangles. So, any solid rectangle (all cells within the rectangle are 1s). Then, the perimeter of such a rectangle (the outermost cells) are replaced by 3s.\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, in Example0, the first structure is a hollow rectangle. So the 1s form the outline of a rectangle, and all are replaced by 3s. So perhaps even hollow rectangles are considered. So perhaps the rule is: any 1 that is part of the perimeter (the border) of a rectangle, whether the rectangle is hollow or filled. But how do you detect that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any 1 that is part of a \"contour\" line, like the outline of a shape. But that's vague.\n\nAnother approach: look for 1s that are on the edge of a connected region. For example, a cell is on the edge if it has at least one neighboring cell (up, down, left, right) that is 0. But in Example0, the first structure (hollow rectangle), the inner cells are 0, so the 1s on the inside edge would be considered edges. But according to the output, those 1s are replaced by 3s. However, in the case of a filled rectangle, the perimeter 1s would have neighboring 0s only on the outside, while inner 1s would be surrounded by other 1s.\n\nWait, but in the case of a filled rectangle, the cells on the perimeter (outer edges) would have 0s adjacent (if they are on the border of the grid or adjacent to 0s). But inner cells would be surrounded by 1s. So if the rule is to replace 1s that are on the edge of a connected region (i.e., have at least one adjacent 0), then the perimeter of any shape would have their 1s replaced by 3s, and the inner 1s (if any) would remain 1. But in the first example, the hollow rectangle's 1s are all edges (since they have 0s inside), so they would all be replaced. In a filled rectangle, the outer 1s would be edges (adjacent to 0s), and inner 1s would not. So that would fit the examples.\n\nWait, let's test this hypothesis. For example, in Example0, the first structure (hollow rectangle) has all 1s adjacent to 0s (since the inside is 0s). So all those 1s would be edges, hence replaced by 3s. In the output, that's exactly what happens. For the filled rectangle (if there were any), the outer 1s would be edges and replaced by 3s, and the inner 1s would remain. However, looking at the second example (Example1), the 3x3 hollow square's perimeter 1s are all edges (they have 0s inside), so replaced by 3s. But in the input of Example1, there's a 1 in row3, position 10 (0-based?), which is part of a vertical line. Let's see: in row3, column10 is 1. In row4, column10 is 1. In row5, column10 is 0. So this vertical line has three 1s in rows3-5. For the middle cell (row4, column10), its neighbors are 1 above and 0 below. So this cell would have a 0 neighbor (below), so it's an edge cell, hence replaced by 3. But in the output of Example1, row4, column10 remains 1. Wait, no. In Example1's input row4, the 1 at column10 (position 10) is in the fourth row's input, and in the output, it remains 1. But according to the hypothesis, since that cell has a 0 neighbor below (row5, column10 is 0), then it should be considered an edge cell and replaced by 3. But in the output, it's still 1. So the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. That's a problem. So maybe the rule isn't simply replacing all edge 1s (those with adjacent 0s) with 3s.\n\nLet me look back. In Example1's input row4, the 1 at position10 is part of a vertical line of three 1s (rows3,4,5, column10). But row5, column10 is 0, so row4's cell has a 0 below. So according to the edge hypothesis, this cell is on the edge. But in the output, it remains 1. So that contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the 3s are replacing 1s that are part of the outline of a rectangle, regardless of their neighbors. So how can we detect that?\n\nAnother approach: in all the examples, the 3s seem to replace 1s that form the outline of a rectangle (hollow or filled). So perhaps the rule is that any 1 that is part of a rectangle's outline (i.e., the minimal enclosing rectangle for a group of 1s) is replaced by 3. For example, in the first example, the hollow square's outline is replaced. In the second example, the vertical line's outline would be a rectangle. Wait, but in the vertical line (rows3-5, column10), the minimal enclosing rectangle would be rows3-5, columns10-10. So the outline of this rectangle is the top and bottom cells (rows3 and 5, column10). But row5's column10 is 0, so the actual cells are rows3 and4. So the outline (top and bottom) would be row3 and row4. But that's not a rectangle. So perhaps this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the rule might be that any 1 that is part of a square or rectangle that is at least 2x2 in size. But in Example2, there's a 3x5 rectangle. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: in Example0's output, the first structure's perimeter is replaced by 3s. Looking at the input, that structure is a 3-row tall, 4-column wide hollow rectangle. So the 1s form the outline of a rectangle, and all those 1s are replaced by 3s. Similarly, in Example1's input, the 3x3 hollow square's 1s are replaced by 3s, but the vertical line of three 1s (columns10) are not. So maybe the rule is that 1s that are part of a rectangle (hollow or filled) of at least 2x2 size are replaced by 3s.\n\nWait, but in Example1's input, the vertical line is 3 cells tall but 1 cell wide. So the rectangle would be 3x1. Which doesn't meet the 2x2 requirement. So only 2x2 or larger rectangles have their 1s replaced. But how does that fit with Example0's first structure, which is 3 rows tall and 4 columns wide. All 1s in that rectangle are replaced. But if it's a hollow rectangle, then it's outline. So perhaps the rule is that any 1 that is part of a rectangle (hollow or filled) with width and height at least 2, and the cell is on the perimeter of that rectangle. Then those 1s are replaced by 3s.\n\nBut how to determine which cells are part of such a perimeter.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that all 1s that are part of a rectangle (contiguous block forming a rectangle) are replaced by 3s, except those that are part of a line (1 row or column). So for example, in Example1's vertical line (3 cells tall but 1 column wide), those are lines, not rectangles, so their 1s are not replaced. But in Example0's first structure, it's a rectangle (multiple rows and columns), so all 1s are replaced.\n\nBut in Example2's input, there's a 3-row tall, 5-column wide hollow rectangle. All those 1s are replaced by 3s. Also, the last row's first three 1s are replaced. For example, the input has rows like [1,1,0...], which in the output become [3,3,0...]. But in row6 of Example2's input: [1,1,0...] becomes [3,3,0...]. So those two 1s are part of a horizontal line (2 cells), which is a 1x2 rectangle. So according to the rule, even 1x2 rectangles would have their 1s replaced. But in that case, in Example1's vertical line (3x1) would not be replaced. But 1x2 is a rectangle of width 2, which meets the minimum size. So perhaps the rule is that any 1 that is part of a rectangle (any size, as long as width and height are at least 1) and is on the perimeter. But how to reconcile that with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that all 1s are replaced by 3s except for those that are isolated (single cells) or part of a line (either vertical or horizontal). But Example0's first structure is a rectangle, so all replaced. The vertical line in Example1 is a line, so not replaced. The horizontal line in Example2's row6 is replaced. Wait, but in Example2's input row6: [1,1,0,...] becomes [3,3,0,...]. So a horizontal line of two 1s is replaced by 3s, which contradicts the previous idea. So that hypothesis is invalid.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's look for more patterns. In Example0's input, the output has 3s where the 1s form the outline of a rectangle. For example, the structure at rows 7-10: in the input, it's a 4x4 hollow rectangle. All those 1s are replaced by 3s. Similarly, the structure in rows 10-13: the input has 3 rows with 1s forming a sort of outline. So perhaps the rule is to replace any 1 that is part of a closed loop, forming a rectangle. But how to detect that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace any 1 that is part of a rectangle's outline, regardless of whether the rectangle is filled or hollow. So the outline is the perimeter. How to detect that? For each cell, check if it is on the top, bottom, left, or right edge of any maximal rectangle of 1s. \n\nBut how to find maximal rectangles. Alternatively, think of a rectangle as any contiguous block of 1s that forms a rectangle. For example, if you have a block of 1s that forms a rectangle, then all the 1s on the perimeter of that rectangle are replaced by 3s.\n\nBut how to find all such rectangles. For example, overlapping rectangles would complicate things. But perhaps the rule is to find all maximal rectangles (i.e., the largest possible rectangles) and replace their perimeters. But this might require checking each possible rectangle in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace all 1s that are part of a plus-shaped pattern. But looking at the examples, that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0's input, the first structure (rows 2-4, columns 2-5) is a hollow rectangle. The output replaces all those 1s with 3s. Similarly, in the structure starting at row 10: the input has [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0] (row10), which becomes [3,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]. So those 1s are replaced by 3s. The row10's first three 1s form a horizontal line. So even a horizontal line of three 1s is replaced. But in Example1's vertical line, they are not replaced. Wait, but in Example0's row10, the 1s are part of a larger structure. Looking at row10-13:\n\nRow10: [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow11: [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow12: [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]\nRow13: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]\n\nSo in row10, the first three 1s form a horizontal line. But in row11 and 12, the first and third columns have 1s. So this structure might form a hollow rectangle. For example, rows10-13, columns0-2: in row10, columns0-2 are 1s. Row11, columns0 and 2 are 1s. Row12, columns0 and 2 are 1s. Row13, columns0-2 are 1s. So this forms a hollow rectangle 4 rows tall and 3 columns wide. Hence, all the perimeter 1s are replaced by 3s. So the first three 1s in row10 are part of this rectangle's top edge, hence replaced by 3s.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: any 1 that is part of the perimeter (top, bottom, left, or right edge) of a rectangular region (hollow or filled) is replaced by 3. The inner 1s (if any) remain 1. So the challenge is to detect for each 1 whether it is on the perimeter of a rectangular region.\n\nTo implement this, perhaps the algorithm is as follows:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) that is 1:\n\n1. Find the maximal rectangular region that includes (i,j). The region is defined by all contiguous 1s that form a rectangle. Wait, but contiguous 1s may form any shape, not necessarily a rectangle. So perhaps the rectangle is the minimal enclosing rectangle of the connected component. For example, the minimal rectangle that contains all the 1s in the connected component.\n\nThen, check if the cell (i,j) is on the perimeter (top, bottom, left, or right edge) of that minimal rectangle. If yes, replace it with 3. Otherwise, leave it as 1.\n\nBut how to find the minimal enclosing rectangle for a connected component of 1s.\n\nFor example, if there's a connected component of 1s that form an L-shape, the minimal enclosing rectangle would be the smallest rectangle that contains all the cells of the L-shape. The perimeter of that rectangle would include cells that are part of the L-shape and lie on the edges of the rectangle. Those cells would be replaced by 3s. Other cells in the L-shape that are inside the rectangle but not on the perimeter would remain 1s.\n\nBut in the training examples, there are no such cases, so it's hard to confirm. However, in Example1, the vertical line of 1s (columns10) is a connected component. The minimal enclosing rectangle would be a 3x1 rectangle. The perimeter of this rectangle is the entire rectangle (since it's only one column wide), so the top and bottom cells would be considered perimeter. So for rows3,4,5 (column10), the minimal rectangle would be rows3-5, columns10-10. So the top edge is row3, column10; bottom edge is row5, column10. However, row5, column10 is 0. So the actual connected component is rows3-4, columns10. So minimal rectangle rows3-4, columns10-10. The perimeter is top (row3), bottom (row4). So those cells (rows3 and4, column10) would be replaced by 3s. But in the output, row3, column10 is 1 (output row3: [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]). So in Example1's output, the 1s in column10 of rows3 and4 are not replaced. This contradicts the hypothesis. Therefore, the minimal enclosing rectangle approach might not be the correct one.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the rule is to replace 1s that form a closed loop, like the outline of a rectangle. So for a rectangle to be closed, each cell in the perimeter must have exactly two adjacent 1s in the outline. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example0's first structure:\n\nRow2: [0,0,1,1,1,1,0...]\nRow3: [0,0,1,0,0,1,0...]\nRow4: [0,0,1,1,1,1,0...]\n\nThis forms a hollow rectangle. All the 1s here are part of the outline, hence replaced by 3s. So in this case, the outline forms a closed loop.\n\nAnother example: the vertical line in Example1's column10. The 1s are in rows3 and4. They don't form a closed loop, so their 1s are not replaced.\n\nSo the rule could be: replace 1s that are part of a closed loop (contour) that forms a rectangle. How to detect such loops? For a cell to be part of a rectangle's outline, it must form a closed loop. For example, in a hollow rectangle, each cell in the outline has exactly two adjacent outline cells (except for corners, which have two). But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace all 1s that are part of a rectangle (whether filled or hollow) that has a perimeter of 1s. For example, in a hollow rectangle, the perimeter is the outer ring. In a filled rectangle, the perimeter is the outer ring and the inner cells are filled. But this doesn't explain why in Example1's vertical line, the 1s are not replaced.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that the 3s replace the 1s that are part of the perimeter of a region where the 1s are connected and form a rectangle. For example, if there's a group of 1s forming a rectangle (could be hollow or filled), the perimeter (outer ring) is replaced by 3s. For filled rectangles, the inner 1s would not be part of the perimeter and remain 1s. But in the training examples, we don't have filled rectangles, so this is hard to verify.\n\nBut given the training examples, the pattern seems to be that any 1 that is part of a rectangle's outline (hollow or filled) is replaced by 3. So the problem is to detect which 1s are part of such outlines.\n\nBut how to implement this. For each cell, check if it is on the perimeter of a rectangle. To do this, perhaps look for rectangles that are at least 2x2 in size and have 1s forming their outline.\n\nFor the test input, the user provided a 12x12 grid. We need to apply the same pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe first few rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1]\nRow1: [0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]\nRow2: [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]\nRow3: [0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1]\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow6: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]\nRow8: [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1]\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\nRow10: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]\nRow11: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking for possible rectangles. For example, in rows0, the last five cells are 1s. But that's a single row, so not a rectangle. Row1 has four 1s in columns1-4 and columns7 and 11. But columns7 and 11: row1's columns7 and 11 are 1, but in row2, columns7 and 11 are 1. So perhaps that's part of a structure.\n\nLooking at columns7-11 in rows0-3:\n\nRow0: columns7-11 are 1,1,1,1,1 (five 1s)\nRow1: column7 is 1, columns8-10 are 0, column11 is 1\nRow2: column7 is 1, columns8-10 are 0, column11 is 1\nRow3: column7 is 1, columns8-10 are 0, column11 is 1\nRow4: column7-11 are 1,1,0,1,1 (row4 has [1,1,0,1,1] in columns7-11)\n\nSo this seems to form a hollow rectangle. For example, rows0-4, columns7-11. But row0 has five 1s, which might form the top of a rectangle. Row1-3 have 1s at columns7 and 11, and row4 has 1s at columns7,8,10,11 (but not 9). So perhaps this is a hollow rectangle with some missing parts. Alternatively, maybe rows0-4, columns7-11 form a structure where the perimeter is 1s. If so, the perimeter cells would be replaced by 3s.\n\nAnother structure is in rows7-10, columns4-8. Let's look:\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]\nRow8: [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1]\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\nRow10: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nRows7-10, columns4-8: \n\nRow7: columns4-8 are 1,1,1,1,1 (5 cells)\nRow8: column4 is 1, columns5-7 are 0, column8 is 1\nRow9: column4 is 1, columns5-7 are 0, column8 is 1\nRow10: columns4-8 are 1,1,1,1,1\n\nSo this forms a hollow rectangle. The top row (row7) and bottom row (row10) have all 1s in columns4-8. Rows8 and 9 have 1s at columns4 and 8. So this is a hollow rectangle 4 rows tall and 5 columns wide. The perimeter of this rectangle would be the outer 1s, which should be replaced by 3s.\n\nAnother structure is in rows1-3, columns1-4: \n\nRow1: columns1-4 are 1,1,1,1\nRow2: columns1 is 1, columns2-3 are 0, column4 is 1\nRow3: columns1-4 are 1,1,1,1\n\nSo this is a hollow rectangle 3 rows tall and 4 columns wide. The perimeter 1s would be replaced by 3s.\n\nRow6 has [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. This is two 1s in columns1-2. Since they are a horizontal line of two 1s, perhaps considered a 1x2 rectangle. The perimeter would be both cells (since it's a single row, so top and bottom edges are the same row). So both cells would be replaced by 3s.\n\nNow, applying the pattern: replace all 1s that are part of the perimeter of a rectangle (hollow or filled). So for each of these structures, the perimeter 1s become 3s.\n\nFor the test input, the expected output would be:\n\nIn row0: the last five 1s are part of a single row. Since it's a 1x5 rectangle, the perimeter would be the first and last cells, but since it's a single row, all cells are part of the perimeter. But according to previous examples, horizontal lines are replaced. For example, in Example2's row6, two 1s become 3s. So perhaps any horizontal line of two or more 1s is considered a rectangle, and all their 1s are replaced. So row0's five 1s would become five 3s.\n\nRow1-3's structure would have the perimeter 1s replaced. So row1's 1s in columns1-4 (all 1s) are part of the top row of the hollow rectangle, so replaced by 3s. Row2's 1s in columns1 and4 would be replaced by 3s. Row3's 1s in columns1-4 are the bottom row of the hollow rectangle, replaced by 3s.\n\nIn row4's columns7-11, there are 1s. This might be part of a rectangle with row0's 1s. The perimeter would include row0's 1s, rows1-3's columns7 and11, and row4's 1s. But row4's columns7-8,10-11 are 1s. So this might form a rectangle with top row0 (columns7-11), left columns7, right columns11, and bottom row4. So the perimeter 1s are row0's columns7-11, rows1-3's columns7 and11, and row4's columns7,8,10,11. These would be replaced by 3s.\n\nRow7-10's structure would have their perimeter 1s replaced by 3s. So row7's columns4-8 (all 1s) become 3s. Row8's columns4 and8 become 3s. Row9's columns4 and8 become 3s. Row10's columns4-8 become 3s.\n\nRow6's columns1-2 become 3s.\n\nRow8's column11 is 1. But in row8, column11 is part of a single cell, so not part of a rectangle. So it remains 1.\n\nRow8 has another structure in columns8-11: column8 is 1 (row8), column11 is 1. But row9's column8 is 1. So maybe that's a vertical line. But not part of a rectangle, so remains 1s.\n\nPutting this all together, the output would replace various 1s with 3s as per the perimeters of rectangles.",
