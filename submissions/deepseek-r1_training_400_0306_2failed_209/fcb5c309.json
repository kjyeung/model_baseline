        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The goal is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists. Let's start by looking at the training examples to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 13x13 grid (since there are 13 rows each with 13 elements). The output is a 7x7 grid. The numbers in the output are mostly 4s and 0s. Let's see where the 4s are in the output. The first and last rows are all 4s. The middle rows have 4s at the start and end, with some 4s in the middle. For instance, the third row in the output is [4,4,0,0,0,0,4]. Hmm. Looking at the input, there are several 4s scattered around. Maybe the output is capturing some kind of structure from the input. Like, perhaps the outline of a shape made by 4s in the input?\n\nWait, the input for Example 0 has a lot of 2s forming a frame. Like, rows 3 to 8 (0-indexed) have 2s forming a border. For example, row 3: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,...]. Maybe the output is creating a smaller grid that represents the outline of the largest structure made by the number (4 in this case), but how?\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, all the 4s might correspond to the positions of 4s in the input. Let me check. The input has 4s in positions like (0,4), (6,4), (9,4), (9,10), (10,9), (12,4), (12,11). But the output is a 7x7 grid. Maybe the output is a condensed version where each cell in the output corresponds to a certain area in the input. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the maximum value in each corresponding cell of some transformed grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the outline of a certain structure. For example, in Example 0's input, the 2s form a sort of square frame. The output's 4s could be forming a similar frame but with 4s. Wait, but where are the 4s in the input? For example, in row 4 of the input, there's a 4 at position 1. Then in row 6, position 4. And others. Maybe the output is a combination of certain elements from the input, but I'm not seeing it yet.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The output is a 6x7 grid (wait, no, the output for Example 1 is 6 rows, each with 7 elements). The numbers here are 3s and 0s. The input in Example 1 has 3s scattered. The output seems to form a frame again, with 3s around the edges and some internal 3s. For instance, the third row in the output is [3,3,0,3,0,0,3]. Maybe the output is capturing the positions where the number (3 in this case) is present in certain positions in the input. But how?\n\nAnother approach: the output dimensions. In Example 0, input is 13x13, output is 7x7. 13-7=6. So perhaps each dimension is reduced by 6? Not sure. Let's check other examples. Example 1's input has 13 rows (from the input list) but wait, the input for Example 1 has 13 rows? Let me count. Example 1's input is:\n\nThe input lists start with [0,0,...] and there are 13 lines (since the output is 6 rows, but the input for Example 1 is 13 rows as well? Wait, no. Let me count:\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nThere are 13 input rows. The output is 6 rows, each with 7 elements. Hmm. So 13 rows input to 6 rows output, and 16 columns (since the first input row is length 16) to 7 columns. So perhaps the output is a cropped or centered part of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the maximum value in a certain window of the input. For example, taking the middle section of the input. Let's check Example 0's input. The input is 13x13. The output is 7x7. If we take the middle 7 rows and middle 7 columns of the input, would that align with the output?\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 4s are at positions (0,4), (6,4), (9,4), etc. The output's first row is all 4s. The middle row (row 3) in the output has 4s at start and end. Maybe the output is a transformation that focuses on a central area, perhaps the largest contiguous block of non-zero numbers. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a kind of \"compression\" where each row in the output is the sum or presence of certain values in the input's rows. Let's think.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output grids. In Example 0's output, the 4s form a frame with some internal 4s. The first and last rows are all 4s. The second and sixth rows have 4s at the ends. The third, fourth, fifth have 4s at the start and end, plus a 4 in the middle for row 4 (position 4). Maybe this is the outline of a diamond or some symmetrical shape. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the result of tracing the positions of a certain number (like the highest number in the input) in the input, creating a minimal bounding box around them, and then drawing the outline. For example, in Example 0, the 4s are scattered. The output seems to form a diamond-like shape. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output. It's 7 rows, each with 7 elements. The numbers are 2s and 0s. The output starts and ends with all 2s. The middle rows have 2s at the start and end, with some 2s in between. Like in row 5 of the output: [2,0,0,0,0,2,2]. So maybe this is a frame with some internal structure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input, there are 3s forming a structure. The output is 2s. So the output's number might be the highest number in the input, but not sure. For Example 0, the output uses 4s which is the highest number in the input. Example 1 uses 3s, which matches the highest in the input. Example 2 uses 2s, which might be the highest in the input. Wait, in Example 2's input, the numbers include 3, 2, etc. But the output is 2s. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 2's input, the first few rows have 3s and 2s. The output is 2s. But why? Maybe the output is based on a certain number that's predominant in a certain structure. Alternatively, maybe the output is derived from a specific layer in the input. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the outline of a certain shape formed by a particular number. For instance, in Example 0, the 4s in the input are scattered, but the output forms a frame. Maybe the output is a minimal frame that encloses all the instances of the number (4 in this case). But in Example 0's input, the 4s are in positions that might form a cross or something. Wait, the output for Example 0 is a frame with 4s, but the input's 4s are in various positions. Maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output dimensions. Example 0 input: 13x13 \u2192 output 7x7. 13-7=6. 7 is half of 14 (close to 13). Example 1 input is 13 rows (each of length 16) \u2192 output is 6x7. So perhaps the output is taking a central section. For a 13-row input, maybe rows 3 to 9 (7 rows) and columns 5 to 11 (7 columns). Let me check Example 0's input.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 4s are in row 0, column 4; row 6, column 4; row 9, column 4; row 9, column 10; row 10, column 9; row 12, column 4 and 11. If the output is a central 7x7 section, but how do these positions map?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the maximum value found in each cell when the input is divided into a grid that's scaled down. For example, if the input is divided into 7x7 regions, each output cell is the max of the corresponding input region. But in Example 0, the input is 13x13. 13 divided by 7 is roughly 1.85 per cell. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking every other row and column, starting from the middle. For example, in a 13x13 grid, the middle row is row 6 (0-based). Then take row 6, and then skip some rows. But the output in Example 0 is 7 rows. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a diamond shape. For Example 0's output, the first and last rows are all 4s, and each middle row has 4s at positions that form a diamond. But how does this relate to the input?\n\nWait, looking at the input for Example 0: the rows that have 2s form a sort of square. For example, rows 2 and 8 are all 2s except for some zeros. The 4s are inside this square. The output seems to form a diamond or a rotated square. Maybe the transformation is to create a diamond-shaped frame where each layer corresponds to a certain distance from the center. But how would that connect to the input's numbers?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a result of some kind of cellular automaton or maze-solving, where the output represents the shortest path or walls. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output in each example seems to have a border made of the highest number from the input, and some internal structures. For example, in Example 0, the output's borders are all 4s, and there's a single 4 in the middle of the third row. Maybe the output is a compressed version where the borders are filled with the highest number, and internal cells are filled if there's a corresponding number in the input.\n\nWait, but how to map the input's cells to the output's. Let's see: Example 0's output has 7 rows. The input has 13. If we take the middle 7 rows (rows 3 to 9) and middle 7 columns (columns 3 to 9) of the input, does that match the output?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input rows 3 to 9:\n\nRow 3: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,2,2]\nRow 4: [2,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,2]\nRow 5: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,2]\nRow 6: [2,0,0,0,4,0,2,0,0,0,2,2,2]\nRow 7: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 8: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]\n\nIf we take columns 3 to 9 from these rows:\n\nRow 3 columns 3-9: [0,0,0,0,0,2,0]\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\nRow 6: [0,0,4,0,2,0,0]\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\nRow 8: [2,2,2,2,2,0,0]\nRow 9: [0,4,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nBut the output of Example 0 is:\n\n[4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n[4,4,0,0,0,0,4]\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n[4,0,0,0,4,0,4]\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n[4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nThis doesn't match. So perhaps that's not the approach.\n\nAlternative approach: look for the output being a transformation where each row in the output corresponds to the non-zero elements in a certain pattern in the input. For example, in Example 0's input, the 4s are scattered, but the output arranges them into a diamond shape. Maybe the pattern is that the output is a diamond where each layer corresponds to the presence of the highest number in the input at certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a minimal grid that contains all instances of the highest number (4 in Example 0, 3 in Example 1, 2 in Example 2) and forms a symmetrical shape. For example, in Example 0, the output is a diamond that includes all 4s from the input. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input 4s are at:\n\nRow 0, column 4\n\nRow 4, column 1\n\nRow 6, column 4\n\nRow 9, columns 4 and 10\n\nRow 10, column 9\n\nRow 12, columns 4 and 11\n\nThe output is a diamond-shaped grid. If we imagine a diamond where the center is at (3,3) of the output (since it's 7x7), then positions correspond to Manhattan distances. For example, the first row (all 4s) has maximum distance from center. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell (i,j) is 4 if there's a 4 in the input at position (i + offset, j + offset). But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's output, the number of 4s in each row is as follows:\n\nRow 0: 7\n\nRow 1: 2 (first and last)\n\nRow 2: 3 (first, second, last)\n\nRow 3: 2 (first and last)\n\nRow 4: 3 (first, fifth, last)\n\nRow 5: 2 (first and last)\n\nRow 6: 7\n\nThis forms a diamond pattern. So perhaps the output is always a diamond where the highest number in the input is placed in a diamond pattern. But how does the input's 4s lead to that? Because in the input, the 4s are scattered. But maybe the output is not directly related to the input's positions, but is a generated diamond pattern using the highest number.\n\nBut why would the training examples have different outputs if that's the case? Maybe the diamond's size depends on the input. For Example 0, it's 7x7. Example 1's output is 6x7. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a representation of a maze or a path. For example, in Example 0's output, the 4s form a border and certain internal walls. But this is speculative.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the Test Input. The numbers include 1, 8, etc. The highest number is 8. So the output should be 8s forming a diamond or similar structure. Let's see what the Test Input looks like.\n\nThe Test Input has 17 rows, each of 17 elements. The output should be a smaller grid, likely based on the highest number (8). Let's see:\n\nLooking at the Test Input, there's an 8 in row 2, column 6 and 8; row 3, column 12 and 14; row 6, column 6 and 16; row 8, column 13; row 9, column 1; row 10, column 5; row 14, column 3 and 4 and 7; row 16, column 8 and 9 and 16.\n\nIf the pattern is to create a diamond-shaped grid with 8s, then the output would have a similar structure to the training examples but with 8s. For example, the first and last rows would be all 8s, the second and penultimate rows would have 8s at the start and end, etc. But how to determine the exact pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the training examples, the number of rows in the output seems to depend on the input's structure. For example, Example 0's output has 7 rows, which is 13 (input rows) minus 6. Example 1's output has 6 rows, input has 13 rows. So that's inconsistent. Maybe the output's row count is determined by the number of times the highest number appears vertically or something. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is a central window of the input where the highest number is most concentrated. For example, in Example 0, maybe the 4s are in the middle 7 rows and columns. But looking at the input, the 4s are scattered, so not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the result of a flood fill algorithm starting from the highest number, creating a frame around the filled area. But I need to see if the input's highest numbers form a certain shape that's captured in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the outline of the largest connected region of the highest number. For Example 0, if the 4s form a certain connected shape, the output is its outline. But in Example 0's input, the 4s are not connected. So that might not be it.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a grid where each cell is the sum of the corresponding row and column in the input, modulo something. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input and output. The input has several 3s forming a structure, and the output uses 2s. That's confusing because 3 is higher than 2. So maybe the highest number in the output is not the highest in the input. That's conflicting with previous examples. Wait, in Example 2's input, the first few rows have a lot of 3s, but the output is made of 2s. Hmm. This breaks the earlier hypothesis that the output uses the highest number from the input. So I need to reconsider.\n\nWait, maybe the output uses the number that forms the largest continuous structure in the input. For Example 0, 2s form a large frame, but the output uses 4s. So that's not it. Alternatively, maybe the output uses a number that is present in a certain pattern in the input, like forming a closed loop.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs in the training examples all have borders made of the same number and some internal elements. The internal elements might correspond to positions where the input has that number in the same relative position. For instance, in Example 0's output, the middle row (row 4) has a 4 at position 4. In the input's middle rows, there's a 4 at column 4. So maybe the output's internal 4s are where the input's 4s are in the central area.\n\nBut how to map the input's positions to the output's. For example, in Example 0's input, the 4s are at (0,4), (4,1), (6,4), (9,4), etc. The output's 4s include positions that could be the central ones. But the mapping isn't obvious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a downsampled version where every other row and column is taken, but centered. For example, take rows 3,5,7,9,11,13 (if possible) from the input. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a transformation where the grid is rotated 45 degrees, turning squares into diamonds. If the input has a square made of a certain number, the output is its diamond-shaped rotation. But how to confirm.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2s form a square frame. If we rotate that 45 degrees, it would form a diamond shape. The output for Example 0 is a diamond made of 4s, but the input's square is made of 2s. So that might not be directly related. But perhaps the output is a diamond frame of the highest number, regardless of the input's structure.\n\nBut why in Example 0's output, the 4s form a diamond? Because the input's 4s are scattered. This is confusing.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output's structure. Each output starts and ends with a full row of the target number. The middle rows have the target number at the beginning and end, with some internal points. This resembles a diamond or hexagonal shape when viewed.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nRow 1: [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow 2: [4,4,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow 3: [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow 4: [4,0,0,0,4,0,4]\n\nRow 5: [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow 6: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nThis looks like a diamond with the top and bottom as full rows, and each row in between having varying numbers of 4s. The middle row (row 3) has 4s at the ends. The row above and below (rows 2 and 4) have an extra 4 in the middle.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a diamond pattern where the number of 4s in each row follows a certain pattern. For a 7x7 grid:\n\nRow 0: 7\n\nRow 1: 2\n\nRow 2: 3\n\nRow 3: 2\n\nRow 4: 3\n\nRow 5: 2\n\nRow 6: 7\n\nBut this doesn't form a symmetrical diamond. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a frame that's wider at the top and bottom and narrower in the middle. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output might be generated by some form of run-length encoding or by tracing the perimeter of a certain area in the input. For example, if the input's 4s form a certain shape, the output is its outline.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a maze-like structure where the target number forms paths. For instance, in Example 0's output, the 4s form a sort of path that you could navigate through.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's think differently. Perhaps the output is a transformation where each cell in the output is 1 if the corresponding input cell is non-zero, but scaled down. For example, if the input is larger, the output is a compressed version where each cell represents a block of the input. But how?\n\nFor instance, in Example 0's input (13x13), the output is 7x7. If each output cell represents a 2x2 block in the input (rounded up), but 13x13 divided into 7x7 would require overlapping blocks. But this is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the central part of the input where most non-zero values are located. For example, in Example 0's input, the 2s form a large square in the middle rows. The output could be the central 7x7 part of that square. But looking at the input's rows 2 to 8 (which are part of the 2s structure), and columns 0 to 6 (since the 2s are in the first 7 columns), but the output's 4s don't align with that.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by taking the maximum value in each diagonal of the input. For example, for each diagonal in the input, take the max value and place it in the output. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a result of a bitwise operation or some mathematical transformation. But since the numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, etc., that's unlikely.\n\nWait, looking at the Test Input. The highest number is 8. The output should be a grid made of 8s in a pattern similar to the training examples. Let's imagine what that pattern would look like. Based on the training examples, the output starts and ends with a full row of the target number, with the inner rows having that number at the start and end, and sometimes in the middle. For example, in Example 0, the third row has 4s at the start and end, and the fourth row has an additional 4 in the middle.\n\nSo perhaps the Test Input's output will have a similar structure but with 8s. Let's try to construct it. The output will likely be a 7x7 grid (since the training examples' outputs are 7x7, 6x7, 7x7). But the Test Input has 17 rows and columns, which is larger than the training examples. Maybe the output size depends on the input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, the Test Input's output might be 9x9, but the training examples' outputs are 7x7, 6x7, 7x7. Not sure. However, looking at the Test Input's structure, there's a large block of 1s in rows 1-8 (0-based?), and some 8s scattered around. For example, row 2 has 8s at columns 6 and 8. Row 3 has 8s at 12 and 14. The output for the Test Input might form a diamond-shaped frame of 8s around these positions.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, this is challenging. Maybe the pattern is that the output is a diamond-shaped grid where the number of rows is 2n+1, with n being the highest number's occurrence in the input. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a grid where each row is formed by taking the first occurrence of the highest number in each row of the input, then creating a frame from that. But I need to look for a pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in each training example, the output's first and last rows are all the highest number, and the middle rows have that number at the first and last positions, with possible internal positions based on the input's highest number occurrences.\n\nFor Example 0, the first and last rows are all 4s. The middle rows have 4s at the start and end, plus some in the middle where the input has 4s in the corresponding rows. Maybe the output rows correspond to the input rows that contain the highest number, and the columns are adjusted to form a diamond.\n\nBut how to map the rows and columns. For Example 0's input, the output has 7 rows. The input has 13 rows. If the output rows are the ones where the highest number (4) appears, there are several such rows. For example, rows 0,4,6,9,10,12. That's 6 rows. But the output has 7 rows, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows are the central rows of the input, and columns are the central columns. For Example 0's 13x13 input, central 7 rows are rows 3-9, and columns 3-9. But as checked earlier, that doesn't directly map to the output.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the rows and columns where the highest number appears, and then creating a minimal bounding box around those positions. For Example 0, the 4s are in rows 0,4,6,9,10,12. The minimal bounding box would be from row 0 to 12, but that's the entire input. So that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the outline of a certain shape that's implied by the input. For example, in Example 0, the 2s form a square frame. The output uses 4s to form a diamond frame. Maybe the output is a rotated version of the input's frame, using the highest number.\n\nBut why would Example 0's output use 4s instead of 2s then?\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to look for another angle.\n\nLooking at the Test Input's structure:\n\nRow 2: 1s and 8s.\n\nRow 3: 1s and 8s.\n\nRow 4: 1s and 8s.\n\nThere's a block of 1s forming a square in rows 1-8, columns 4-11 (since row 1 is [0,0,...,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0...], which starts at column 4). The 8s are inside and around this block.\n\nMaybe the output is a diamond-shaped frame around this block of 1s, but using the highest number (8). For example, the output would be a diamond made of 8s, perhaps surrounding the 1s structure.\n\nBut how to determine the exact positions. Alternatively, the output could be a diamond where each layer corresponds to the distance from the center. For example, the outer layer is all 8s, then the next layer has 8s at the edges, etc. But the training examples' outputs don't exactly follow this pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a grid where each cell is 8 if there's an 8 in the corresponding position of the input's central area. For example, taking the central 7x7 part of the Test Input's 17x17 grid. The Test Input's central 7x7 would be rows 5-11 and columns 5-11. Let's check what's in that area.\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,1,0,8,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,8,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 10: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 11: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nColumns 5-11 in these rows:\n\nRow 5: columns 5-11: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow 6: columns 5-11: [0,8,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow 7: columns 5-11: [0,0,0,0,8,0,1]\n\nRow 8: columns 5-11: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow 9: columns 5-11: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 10: columns 5-11: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 11: columns 5-11: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1]\n\nThis doesn't seem to form the diamond pattern of the output examples. So maybe that's not the approach.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps the pattern is that the output is a diamond-shaped grid where the highest number from the input forms the outline, and the size of the diamond corresponds to the number of occurrences of the highest number. For the Test Input, the highest number is 8, which appears multiple times. So the output would be a diamond made of 8s.\n\nAssuming that the output's diamond is 7x7 for the Test Input (as in Example 0 and 2), the pattern would be:\n\nRow 0: all 8s.\n\nRow 1: 8 at start and end.\n\nRow 2: 8 at start, next position, and end.\n\nRow 3: 8 at start and end.\n\nRow 4: 8 at start, middle, and end.\n\nRow 5: 8 at start and end.\n\nRow 6: all 8s.\n\nThis matches the structure of Example 0's output. So applying this to the Test Input, the output would be a 7x7 diamond of 8s with possible internal 8s based on the input's 8s.\n\nBut how to confirm if this is the case. Looking at Example 2's output, the highest number in the input is 3, but the output uses 2s. This contradicts the earlier hypothesis. So this approach is invalid.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not based on the highest number. So perhaps the pattern is based on another factor.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output: the output uses 2s, which is present in the input's structure. For example, the input has a 2 in row 2, column 3 and 5. The output's first row is all 2s. So maybe the output uses the number that forms the largest contiguous structure in the input. For Example 2, the 3s form a larger structure, but the output uses 2s, which is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output number is the one that forms a closed loop in the input. For Example 0, the 2s form a closed loop, but the output uses 4s. So that's not it.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of the output as a kind of kernel or filter applied to the input. For example, each output cell is a certain combination of the input cells around it. But without more examples, it's hard to determine the exact kernel.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the result of a maze-solving algorithm where the path is traced using the highest number. But again, without clear evidence from the examples, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of a line detection algorithm, where the highest number forms lines in a certain direction. For Example 0's output, the lines are diagonal, forming a diamond.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not making progress, perhaps I should try to infer the pattern based on the structure of the output grids and apply it to the Test Input.\n\nIn each training example, the output is a grid where the first and last rows are all the same number (the highest in the input), and the inner rows have that number at the start and end, plus some in the middle. The structure resembles a diamond or hexagonal shape.\n\nAssuming that the Test Input's output should follow the same pattern with 8s, the output would be:\n\nRow 0: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow 1: [8,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 2: [8,8,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 3: [8,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 4: [8,0,0,0,8,0,8]\n\nRow 5: [8,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 6: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nBut wait, the middle row (row 3) would have 8s at the ends, and row 4 would have an 8 in the middle. However, in Example 0's output, row 4 has a 4 in the middle. Maybe the Test Input's output would have an 8 in the middle if there's an 8 in the corresponding position of the input's center.\n\nLooking at the Test Input's central row (row 8) and column (column 8), there's a 1 in the input. So perhaps the middle 8 is not present. Alternatively, the output's middle 8 is based on an 8 in the input's corresponding position.\n\nBut given the Test Input's structure, there's an 8 in row 6, column 6, which is near the center. Maybe the output's middle position (row 3, column 3 in a 7x7 grid) corresponds to that 8. So the output's row 4 (middle row) would have an 8 in the center.\n\nHowever, without a clear mapping between input and output positions, this is speculative. But given the training examples, it's likely that the output follows a diamond pattern with the highest number, regardless of the input's exact positions. So the final answer for the Test Input would be a 7x7 grid with 8s forming a diamond, similar to Example 0's output but with 8s.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists for these training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 13x13 grid, and the output is a 7x7 grid. Similarly, in Example 1, the input is a 13x16 grid (since there are 13 rows each with 16 elements) and the output is a 6x7 grid. Wait, no, looking again: Example 1's input has 13 rows, each with 16 elements. The output has 6 rows of 7 elements each. Hmm, maybe the output size is related to the input's dimensions. But not sure yet. Let me check Example 2: input is 15 rows of 16 elements, output is 7 rows of 7 elements each. Wait, the output lengths vary. Example 0's output is 7 rows of 7 elements. Example1's output is 6 rows of 7. Example2's output is 7 rows of 7 again. Hmm. Maybe the output is a cropped version of the input, but how?\n\nLooking at the input and output of Example 0. Let me visualize. The output starts with [4,4,4,4,4,4,4], which is seven 4s. Then the next rows have 4s at the start and end. Looking at the input, the first input row has a 4 in the fifth position (index 4). But how does that relate to the output? Maybe the 4s in the input are forming a certain shape in the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves taking the largest connected region of a certain number and then creating a border around it. Wait, in Example 0's input, the output is all 4s. The input has multiple 4s. Let's see: the input rows have 4s at certain positions. The output seems to form a frame or a rectangle. For instance, the output in Example 0 is a square with 4s forming the perimeter and some 4s inside. Wait, the output's first row is all 4s. The next rows have 4 at the start and end. The middle rows have 4s on the edges and maybe some 4s in the middle where the input had 4s. Like, maybe the output is a compacted version of the regions in the input where the non-zero numbers are, creating a frame around them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a kind of \"maze\" structure, where the non-zero elements in the input are walls, and the output is their outline. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has a lot of 2s forming structures. The output is 4s. Wait, the output uses 4, which is one of the numbers in the input. Maybe the highest number in the input becomes the number used in the output. For example, in Example 0, the input has 4 and 2. The output is all 4s. In Example 1, the input has 3, 1, etc., and the output is all 3s. Example 2's input has 2,3, etc., and the output is all 2s. So the output uses the highest number from the input. So, the first step is to identify the maximum number in the input, and that becomes the number used in the output.\n\nSo the test input has 8, 1, etc. So the maximum is 8. So the output should be all 8s.\n\nNow, the structure. The output for each example seems to be a rectangle with borders made of the maximum number. Let's look at the output dimensions. Example 0's output is 7x7. The input's rows are 13 elements each. Maybe the output is a centered smaller matrix. Or perhaps it's the minimal rectangle that encloses all the non-zero elements of the maximum value.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 4s are in positions like row 0, column 4; row 4, column 1; row 6, column 4; row 9, column 4 and 10; row 12, column 4 and 11. The output is a 7x7 grid where all borders are 4, and some internal 4s. Maybe the output is a bounding box around the maximum value elements in the input. Let's check the positions. The 4s in the input are spread out. How would that form a 7x7 grid? Maybe the output is a specific structure that's a frame, and the positions of the 4s in the input are used to determine the frame's shape. Alternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell corresponds to a certain position relative to the original input, but scaled down.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output rows. For example, in Example 0's output, the first row is all 4s, which is the maximum number. Then the next rows have 4s at the start and end. The middle rows have 4s at the edges and some in between. The structure resembles a frame with some internal 4s. Similarly, Example 1's output is a frame of 3s with some internal 3s. So maybe the output is creating a border around the area where the maximum number appears in the input, and then filling in some cells where the max number exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the outline of a certain shape. For instance, in Example 0, the input has a structure made of 2s (like a rectangle) and 4s inside. The output could be taking the outline of the 2 structure and replacing it with 4s. But that might not fit.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: the input has a lot of 1s forming a structure. The output is all 3s. The 3s in the input are scattered. So perhaps the output is the outline of the largest contiguous block of the maximum value. Wait, but in Example 0, the maximum is 4, but the 4s are scattered. So that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell represents whether the original input's corresponding cell had the maximum value, and then transformed into a frame structure. But how?\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output rows and seeing if they correspond to certain rows in the input. For instance, in Example 0, the input has 13 rows, the output 7. Maybe taking a subset of rows. Let's check. The output for Example 0 is 7 rows. The input has rows 0 to 12. If we take rows 4 to 10 (which are 7 rows), but need to check if those rows correspond to the output. For example, in input row 4 of Example 0: [2,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,2]. The output row 2 is [4,4,0,0,0,0,4]. Not sure. Maybe it's centered? The input is 13 columns; the output is 7. So perhaps the middle 7 columns. For example, in input row 0: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]. The middle 7 columns would be positions 3 to 9 (since 13 columns, middle is 6th, so 3-9). But that would be columns 3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Original row 0's 4 is at position 4. So the middle 7 columns would include that 4. The output's first row is all 4s. But in the input's middle columns, there's a 4 and others are zeros. So that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking all the positions in the input where the maximum value occurs and creating a minimal bounding box around them, then creating a frame of the maximum value around that box, and filling in the positions where the maximum exists.\n\nFor example, in Example 0: the 4s are in positions:\n\nRow 0: 4 at position 4.\n\nRow 4: 4 at position 1.\n\nRow 6: 4 at position 4.\n\nRow 9: 4 at 4 and 10.\n\nRow 10: 4 at position 9.\n\nRow 12: 4 at 4 and 11.\n\nSo the minimal bounding box would need to cover all these positions. The leftmost column is 1 (from row 4), rightmost is 11 (row 12). The top row is 0, and the bottom row is 12. But the output is 7 rows. Wait, but the output has 7 rows. So perhaps this approach isn't matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a diamond shape or some other pattern. But the examples' outputs look more like rectangles with borders.\n\nAnother thought: the output rows have a certain pattern where the first and last elements are the maximum, and the middle elements depend on the input. For example, in Example 0's output, each row starts and ends with 4. The middle elements are 0 except where there were 4s in the input. So perhaps each row in the output is formed by taking the first and last occurrence of the maximum in the corresponding input row, and then filling in between as needed.\n\nBut how do the output rows correspond to the input rows? Because the input rows are longer than the output rows. For example, Example 0's input has 13 columns, the output has 7. So maybe the output is taking the middle section of each input row. For example, taking columns 3 to 9 (7 columns) from each input row. Let's check Example 0's first input row: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]. The middle 7 columns would be positions 3 (0), 4 (4),5 (0),6 (0),7 (0),8 (0),9 (0). So the middle part is [0,4,0,0,0,0,0]. But the output's first row is all 4s, which doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a transformation of the input where each cell in the output is 4 (the maximum) if the corresponding input cell is 4, or if it's on the perimeter of a region of 4s. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a kind of convolution or mask. For example, taking the maximum value's positions and creating a border around them. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: all 4s.\n\nRow 1: 4, then five 0s, then 4.\n\nRows 2-5: similar, with some 4s in the middle.\n\nRow 6: all 4s.\n\nThis looks like a rectangle with a border of 4s, and some 4s inside where the input had 4s. So the output is a frame (border) of 4s, and wherever there was a 4 in the input within that frame, it's kept as 4, otherwise 0. But how is the frame size determined?\n\nThe output dimensions vary. For example, in Example 0, the output is 7x7. Let's see: the input's 4s are spread out, but maybe the frame is of a certain size, like 7x7. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the same size for each example, but the examples given have different sizes. Wait, no: the outputs vary in rows. Example1's output is 6 rows, others are 7. So perhaps the number of rows in the output corresponds to the number of rows in the input that contain the maximum value. Let's check:\n\nExample0's input: 4s are in rows 0,4,6,9,10,12. So 6 rows. But output has 7 rows. Hmm, not matching. Example1's input has 3s in multiple rows. The output has 6 rows. Maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is a grid that's formed by combining certain rows and columns where the maximum number appears. For example, taking the minimal and maximal row and column indices where the maximum appears and creating a grid of that size. But how?\n\nIn Example0, the maximum is 4. Let's find the min and max row and column where 4 appears.\n\nRows with 4: 0,4,6,9,10,12.\n\nColumns with 4 in those rows:\n\nRow 0: columns 4, 12.\n\nRow4: column1.\n\nRow6: column4.\n\nRow9: columns4,10.\n\nRow10: column9.\n\nRow12: columns4,11.\n\nSo the min column is 1 (row4), max column is12 (row0). The min row is 0, max row is12. The bounding box would be rows 0-12 (13 rows) and columns 1-12 (12 columns). That's not matching the output size of 7x7. So that's probably not it.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is different. Let's think about the outputs. All output examples have a solid border (all max numbers) on the first and last rows. Then the inner rows have the max number at the first and last position, and the middle positions are 0 unless there's a max number in the input. For example, in Example0's output:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow2: [4,4,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow3: [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow4: [4,0,0,0,4,0,4]\n\nRow5: [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow6: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nLooking at row4 of the output, there's a 4 in the fifth position. Looking at the input's row6 (since the output rows might correspond to input rows?), but input row6 has a 4 in column4. How would that translate to the output's row4 being [4,0,0,0,4,0,4]? Maybe the output is a 7x7 grid where the borders are all 4, and internal 4s are placed where the input had 4s. But how to map the input positions to the output grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a square grid where each cell (i,j) is 4 if the corresponding position in the input, after some transformation, is 4 or part of the border. For example, the output could be a central part of the input, zoomed in. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the outline of a plus sign made by the maximum number. But in Example0, the output looks more like a rectangle.\n\nWait, another observation: the output for all examples has a certain symmetry. For example, the first and last rows are all max numbers. The other rows start and end with the max. So the output is a rectangular frame, possibly with some internal max numbers where the input had them.\n\nSo the steps might be:\n\n1. Identify the maximum number in the input. Let's call this 'm'.\n\n2. Create a new grid where the first and last rows are all 'm's.\n\n3. For the middle rows, set the first and last element to 'm'.\n\n4. For the other positions in the middle rows, check if the original input had 'm' in a corresponding position, and set to 'm' if so, otherwise 0.\n\nBut how to map the positions from the input to the output, especially since the output is smaller.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 7x7 grid regardless of input size, but that's not the case as Example1's output has 6 rows.\n\nWait, looking again at the training examples:\n\nExample0's output is 7x7.\n\nExample1's output is 6x7.\n\nExample2's output is 7x7.\n\nHmm, the number of rows varies. So maybe the number of rows in the output is determined by the number of times the maximum number appears in certain rows in the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is built by considering each occurrence of the maximum number in the input and creating a certain pattern around it.\n\nAnother idea: the output looks like a maze or a room with walls made of the maximum number. The input's structure of other numbers (like 2 in Example0) is somehow converted into this maze-like structure. But the 2s in the input of Example0 are not in the output. The output is all 4s, which were less frequent in the input. So perhaps the pattern is to create a border around the regions formed by the maximum number.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the result of flood filling the maximum number from certain positions, but that's speculative.\n\nWait, let's compare the input and output of Example0 in more detail.\n\nInput rows for Example0 have 2s forming a large structure. For example:\n\nRow2: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,2,2]\n\nRow4: [2,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,2]\n\nEtc. So the 2s form a kind of border, and inside are some 4s. The output is all 4s, but the input's 4s are sparse. So perhaps the output is not related to the 2s but only the 4s.\n\nBut how the output structure is generated from the 4s.\n\nIn the output of Example0, the 4s form a rectangle with a border and some internal points. For example, row 0 is all 4s (border top), row6 is all 4s (border bottom). Rows 1-5 have 4s at start and end (left and right borders). The internal cells have 4s where the input had 4s. For example, in output row2, position 1 is 4. Looking at input row4, which is part of the input's structure. Input row4 has a 4 at column1, which might correspond to output row2 (if the output rows are a subset of input rows). But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a transformed version where each row corresponds to a certain part of the input. For example, the output rows are centered around the rows where the maximum number appears. But this is vague.\n\nAnother approach: in the output, the first and last rows are all max numbers. The other rows have max numbers at the start and end. The middle elements are 0 except where the input had the max. So perhaps the output is a grid where the borders are the max number, and the inner cells are 0 except where the input had max numbers. But how to map the inner cells.\n\nThe output dimensions might be determined by the number of unique rows in the input that contain the max number. For example, in Example0, the max is 4, which appears in rows 0,4,6,9,10,12 (6 rows), but the output has 7 rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a square with odd dimensions. For example, 7x7. Example1's output is 6x7, but that's not square. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at Example1's output:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,0,0,3,0,0,3]\n\n[3,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\n[3,3,0,3,0,0,3]\n\n[3,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nThis is 6 rows, 7 columns. The first and last rows are all 3s, other rows start and end with 3. The middle columns have some 3s where the input had them. For instance, row1 has a 3 at position3. Maybe in the input, there was a 3 in a corresponding position.\n\nBut how to map the input's positions to the output's.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a compression of the input, taking the first occurrence of the max in each row and building a grid around that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by creating a grid where each cell (i,j) in the output is the maximum value if either i or j is 0 or the maximum index, or if the corresponding position in the input has the maximum value.\n\nBut the output for Example0 has 7 rows and 7 columns. So for cell (i,j), if i is 0 or 6 (the first or last row) or j is 0 or 6 (first or last column), then it's 4. Otherwise, it's 4 only if the input had a 4 in a corresponding position. But how to map input positions to output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a downsampled version of the input. For example, every other row and column is taken. But in Example0's input has 13 rows and columns, which is odd. 13/2 is 6.5, so perhaps taking 7 rows and columns. But how to select which ones.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the central part of the input. For example, in a 13x13 grid, the center 7x7 part. For rows, taking rows 3 to 9 (7 rows), and columns 3 to9 (7 columns). Let's check Example0's input row3: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,2,2]. The central columns 3-9 would be positions3 (0),4 (0),5 (0),6 (2),7 (0),8 (0),9 (0). So the row would be [0,0,0,2,0,0,0]. But the output's first row is all 4s, so that doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's try to think differently. The output's structure resembles a frame. Maybe the output is a frame with thickness 1, filled with the max number, and inside the frame, positions where the input had the max number are retained as max, others 0.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Find the max number in the input.\n\n2. Create a frame (border) of that number, with the size determined by some aspect of the input.\n\n3. Inside the frame, set cells to max if the corresponding input cell had the max number, else 0.\n\nBut the frame size is unclear.\n\nLooking at Example0's output: 7x7. The frame is the first and last row (all 4s), and first and last column of each row. Inside, some 4s.\n\nExample1's output is 6x7. So the number of rows may vary.\n\nMaybe the output's number of rows is determined by the number of input rows that have the max number, plus two (for the top and bottom borders). For example, Example0's input has 4s in 6 rows. Output has 7 rows. 6+1=7. Example1's input has 3s in, let's count:\n\nLooking at Example1's input: the max is 3. Let's see which rows have 3:\n\nRow0: no.\n\nRow1: 3 at column4.\n\nRow2: 3 at column3.\n\nRow3: 3 at column11.\n\nRow4: 3s at columns1 and5.\n\nRow5: 3 at column6 and 11.\n\nRow6: no.\n\nRow7: no.\n\nRow8: no.\n\nRow9: 3 at column5.\n\nRow10: no.\n\nRow11: 3 at columns0, 10.\n\nRow12: 3s at columns0 and7 and10.\n\nSo rows with 3s are rows1,2,3,4,5,9,11,12. Total of 8 rows. Output has 6 rows. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows in the output is the number of times the max number appears in the input vertically plus some adjustment.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is constructed by considering the positions of the max number in the input and creating a minimal bounding box around them, then adding a border around that box.\n\nFor example, in Example0:\n\nThe 4s are in various positions. The minimal bounding box would need to cover all their positions. The leftmost column is 1 (from row4), rightmost is 12 (row0 and row12), top row is 0, bottom row is12. The height is 13 rows, width is 12 columns. Adding a border around that would make it 15 rows and 14 columns, which is larger than the output. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the shape of the largest contiguous block of the max number in the input, but converted into a frame. But in Example0, the max 4s are not contiguous. They are scattered. So that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a new structure where the max number forms a frame, and the inner cells are 0 unless the input had the max number. The frame's size is fixed, like 7x7, but why?\n\nAlternatively, the output is the result of applying a cellular automaton rule that turns the max numbers into a frame. For example, any cell that has a max number and is on the edge of a region becomes part of the frame. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the output of Example0 again, the 4s in the output's middle rows (rows2 and4) have 4s in positions where the input's rows had 4s. For example, output row2 is [4,4,0,0,0,0,4]. The input's row4 has a 4 in column1, which would correspond to output row2's column1. So maybe the output rows are shifted versions of the input rows where 4s are present.\n\nBut how to map the rows. For Example0's output has 7 rows. Input has 13. So perhaps output rows are a subset of the input rows, possibly centered. Let's see:\n\nExample0's input rows are 0-12. Output rows are 7. Maybe output rows are the middle 7 rows of the input. Middle 7 rows of 13 are rows 3-9. Let's check input rows 3-9:\n\nRow3: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,2,2]\n\nRow4: [2,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,2]\n\nRow5: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,2]\n\nRow6: [2,0,0,0,4,0,2,0,0,0,2,2,2]\n\nRow7: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]\n\nBut the output is:\n\n[4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\n[4,4,0,0,0,0,4]\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\n[4,0,0,0,4,0,4]\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\n[4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nThe output's first row is all 4s. Looking at input row3, which has 2s and 0s. That doesn't match. So maybe that's not the approach.\n\nPerhaps the output is generated by a different rule. Let's look at the output of Example0:\n\nThe first and last rows are all 4s. The other rows have 4s at the beginning and end. The middle elements are 0 except for some 4s. For example, row2 has a 4 in the second position. How does this relate to the input?\n\nLooking at input row4 (assuming output row2 corresponds to input row4), which is [2,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,2]. The middle 7 columns (positions3-9) would be [0,0,0,2,0,0,0]. But output row2 is [4,4,0,0,0,0,4]. Not matching.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output is a 7x7 grid where each cell is 4 if the corresponding cell in the input is part of a certain pattern. For example, the outline of a square, plus any 4s inside. But the input's 4s are not forming a square.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 7x7 grid where the borders are 4s, and the inner cells are 4s if the input has a 4 in a corresponding position. But how to map the input's 13x13 to 7x7. Maybe by using a certain offset. For example, output row i corresponds to input row i + 3, and column j corresponds to input column j + 3.\n\nFor example, output row0, column0 corresponds to input row3, column3. Let's check:\n\nInput row3, column3 is 0. Output row0, column0 is 4. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the result of taking the input and replacing every occurrence of the maximum number with a 4 in the output, and creating a border around all of them.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother angle: the output for each example is a grid where the first and last row are all max numbers. Then, for the other rows, first and last element are max, and the middle elements are max if they were in the input. The output's width is determined by the number of columns that have the max number. For example, in Example0, the max 4 appears in columns 1,4, etc. But the output is 7 columns, which is the same for all examples, but Example1's output has 7 columns as well. So this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output is always 7 columns, and the number of rows varies. Example0 and 2 have 7 rows, Example1 has 6. So maybe the columns are fixed at 7, and rows are the number of input rows that have the max number plus some.\n\nBut Example0's input has 4s in 6 rows (0,4,6,9,10,12), output has 7 rows. So 6+1=7. Example1's input has 3s in more than 5 rows, but output has 6 rows. Maybe it's the number of unique rows with the max number plus 1.\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows are determined by the maximum distance between the first and last occurrence of the max number in the rows, plus some.\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLet me look at the Test Input. The max number is 8. The output should be all 8s. The structure should be similar to the examples. Let's see the Test Input:\n\nThe input has 17 rows and 17 columns. The 8s are present in various positions. For example, row0 has 8 at position14. Row2 has 8s at positions6,8. Row3 has 8s at positions12,14. Row4 has 8 at 12,14. Row6 has 8 at position6 and 16. Row7 has 8 at position9. Row8 has 8 at position13. Row9 has 8 at position1. Row10 has 8 at position5. Row13 has 8s at positions5, 11,13. Row14 has 8s at positions3,4,7. Row16 has 8s at position8,9,16.\n\nThe output should be a grid with 8s forming the borders and some internal 8s where the input has them. The number of rows and columns depends on how the pattern is applied.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the outputs have the following structure:\n\n- The first and last rows are all max.\n\n- The first and last elements of each row are max.\n\n- The middle elements are max if the corresponding input position had max, else 0.\n\nBut how to map the input's rows to the output's.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each row corresponds to a row in the input that contains the max number, and the columns are the range from the earliest to the latest occurrence of the max in those rows. Then, a border is added around that.\n\nBut that seems complicated. Let's try for Example0:\n\nMax is 4. The rows with 4 are 0,4,6,9,10,12. For each of these rows, the columns where 4 appears vary. The earliest column is 1 (row4), latest column is12 (row0). So the width would be 12-1+1=12 columns. But the output is 7 columns. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the result of a kernel or mask applied to the input. For example, a 3x3 kernel that checks if the center is max, and if so, sets the output to a certain pattern. But this is speculation.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the outline of a certain region. For example, in Example0's input, the 2s form a larger structure, and the output is the outline of that structure, converted to 4. But why 4?\n\nAlternatively, the output is the outline of the largest connected region of the max number. For example, in Example0, the 4s are scattered, so their outline would form a frame around their positions. But this seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each cell is max if it's on the perimeter of a certain area, and the inner cells are max if they have max in the input. But how to determine the area.\n\nPerhaps the output is a combination of the outline of a certain structure and the positions of the max. For example, the outline is the max number, and inside are 0s except where the input had max.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let me try to look for another pattern.\n\nIn all training examples, the output is a rectangle with the max number as border. The height and width vary. For example, Example0's output is 7x7, Example1 is 6x7, Example2 is7x7. The number of rows in the output seems to be one more than the number of rows in the input that contain the max number, but that's not exact.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows in the output is the number of rows in the input that contain the max number plus two. For Example0, the rows with 4 are 6 rows (0,4,6,9,10,12). 6+2=8, which doesn't match the output's 7 rows. Not helpful.\n\nAnother observation: the outputs for the examples are all odd in row count. Example0 has7, Example1 has6 (even), so that's not the case.\n\nWait, Example1's output has 6 rows. So perhaps the row count depends on the arrangement of the max numbers in the input. For example, if the max numbers are arranged in a way that requires a certain number of rows to frame them.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a minimal grid that includes all the max numbers in the input, with a border around them. For example, in Example0, the 4s are scattered, so the minimal grid that covers all of them and adds a border would be a certain size. But calculating that requires knowing the positions.\n\nFor Example0's input, the 4s are at:\n\nRow 0: col4 and 12.\n\nRow4: col1.\n\nRow6: col4.\n\nRow9: col4 and 10.\n\nRow10: col9.\n\nRow12: col4 and 11.\n\nThe minimal bounding box would have:\n\nmin_row=0, max_row=12 (13 rows).\n\nmin_col=1 (from row4), max_col=12 (from row0).\n\nAdding a border around this would make it 15 rows and 14 columns. But the output is 7x7. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of the output as a compression or transformation where the first and last rows are all max, and each row in between has max at the start and end, with internal values determined by the input.\n\nIf that's the case, then the output for the test input would be a grid where:\n\n- The first and last rows are all 8s.\n\n- Each row in between starts and ends with 8.\n\n- The middle elements are 8 if the corresponding input position has 8, else 0.\n\nBut how to map the input's columns to the output's columns.\n\nThe output's number of columns must be the same for all rows. For the test input's output, how many columns would there be? Looking at the training examples, the output columns are 7 in each case, even when the input's columns are more. So perhaps the output is always 7 columns. But Example1's output has 7 columns, and the test input's output should also have 7 columns. The number of rows could vary.\n\nBut how to determine the rows. For example, the test input's output would likely have a number of rows equal to the number of rows in the input that contain 8, plus some buffer.\n\nWait, the test input has 8s in rows: 0,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,13,14,16. That's 12 rows. But the output can't be 12 rows. The training examples' outputs are smaller. So this approach is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the output has a fixed number of rows and columns. For example, 7x7. But Example1's output has 6 rows. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs' internal structure. For example, in Example0's output, the 4s in the middle rows correspond to input rows that have 4s. For instance, output row2 has a 4 in the second position. Perhaps this corresponds to an input row where there's a 4 in a certain column. Maybe the output is a grid where each row corresponds to an input row that has the max, and each column corresponds to a position where the max is present.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each cell (i,j) is 8 if either i or j is 0 or the max index, or if the input has an 8 in a certain position. But again, mapping is unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without success, perhaps I should try to look for a different pattern. Let's think about the input and output for Example0:\n\nInput has a lot of 2s forming a structure like:\n\nRow2: all 2s for the first seven columns.\n\nRow3: 2s at start and end.\n\nRow4: 2s at start and end, with a 4 inside.\n\nThe output is all 4s. So maybe the output is formed by taking the outline of the 2 structure and replacing it with 4s. For example, the 2s form a sort of rectangle, and the output is that rectangle's outline, filled with 4s.\n\nLooking at the output of Example0, the first and last rows are all 4s (like the outline of the top and bottom), and the other rows have 4s at the start and end (like the outline of the sides). The middle 4s in the output could be where the input had 4s.\n\nSo perhaps the output is the outline of the largest contiguous block (like the 2s in Example0's input), but converted to the max number (4). But then the output is filled with 4s where the input had 4s.\n\nBut how to determine which structure to outline. In Example0, the 2s form a large block. The outline of that block would be a rectangle, and the output is that outline plus the 4s from the input.\n\nIf this is the case, then the steps are:\n\n1. Find the largest contiguous block of non-zero numbers (other than the max) in the input.\n\n2. Create an outline of that block using the max number.\n\n3. Fill in any positions where the input had the max number.\n\nBut how does this fit with the examples?\n\nIn Example0, the largest block is the 2s. The outline of that block would be the perimeter, which in the output is filled with 4s. The input's 4s are then added to the output.\n\nBut then why is the output all 4s and not 2s? Because the output uses the max number (4), not the number from the block (2).\n\nSo the process might be:\n\n- The outline of the largest contiguous block (of any non-zero number) is drawn with the max number.\n\n- Then, any positions where the input had the max number are also filled with the max in the output.\n\nThis could explain Example0's output. The largest block is the 2s' structure. Its outline is drawn with 4s (the max), and the 4s from the input are added.\n\nExample1's input has a large block of 1s. The max is 3. The output is a structure outline with 3s and includes the 3s from the input.\n\nExample2's input has a large block of 3s and 2s. The max is 2. The outline is drawn with 2s, and existing 2s are added.\n\nIf this is the case, then the steps are:\n\n1. Find the maximum number in the input.\n\n2. Identify the largest contiguous block of non-zero numbers (excluding the max).\n\n3. Create an outline of that block, filling with the max number.\n\n4. In the output, also fill any positions where the input had the max number.\n\nBut how to determine the largest contiguous block. For Example0, the 2s are connected, forming a large rectangle. The outline would be its perimeter. The output's outline would match that perimeter, filled with 4s.\n\nFor Example0's output, the outline is a rectangle that is 7 rows tall and 7 columns wide. The original 2s structure in Example0's input is from row2 to row8 (7 rows), and columns0 to6 (7 columns). So the outline of that block is a rectangle of 7x7. So the output is that outline filled with 4s, and the existing 4s from the input are added inside.\n\nYes! That makes sense. So the pattern is:\n\n- Identify the largest contiguous block of non-zero numbers (excluding the max number).\n\n- Create a rectangle (outline) around that block, using the max number.\n\n- Inside the outline, fill with max number where the input had the max number.\n\nSo, in Example0:\n\nThe largest block is the 2s from row2 to row8, columns0 to6. The outline of this block is a rectangle. The output is this outline filled with 4s, and any positions where the input had 4s are also 4s.\n\nThe output dimensions are the same as the block's dimensions. For example, the block is 7 rows (rows2-8) and 7 columns (columns0-6), so the output is 7x7.\n\nExample1's input has a large block of 1s. The largest block is the 1s structure. The outline is created with 3s (the max). The block's dimensions determine the output's size.\n\nExample2's largest block is the 3s and possibly others. The output is 7x7, filled with 2s (the max), forming the outline of the largest block.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nThe max number is 8.\n\nThe largest contiguous block of non-zero numbers (excluding 8) is likely the 1s. The input has a large block of 1s in rows1-8 and columns4-10 (assuming rows start at 0). For example, rows1 has 1s from columns4 to 10 (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1). Then rows2-8 have 1s in various positions. The largest contiguous block would be the 1s in rows1-8, columns4-10. The outline of this block would be a rectangle. The height is 8-1+1=8 rows, width is 10-4+1=7 columns. So the output would be 8 rows x7 columns, filled with 8s in the outline and any input 8s inside.\n\nBut looking at the output examples, they seem to have varying rows. For example, Example0's block was 7 rows (rows2-8), output 7x7. Example1's block may be smaller.\n\nWait, in Example0's input, the block is rows2-8 (7 rows), columns0-6 (7 columns). So output is 7x7.\n\nIn the test input, the block of 1s is rows1-8 (8 rows) and columns4-10 (7 columns). So the outline would be 8 rows x7 columns. So the output would be 8 rows x7 columns. The first and last rows are all 8s. The other rows have 8s at the first and last columns, and the middle columns are 0 except where the input has 8s.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the output has the same number of rows as the block's height. For Example0, block height is 7, output rows 7.\n\nSo for the test input, the output would be 8 rows x7 columns. Each row starts and ends with 8. The first and last rows are all 8s. The middle rows have 8s at the first and last positions, and in between, 8s where the input has 8s.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nThe largest contiguous block is the 1s in rows1-8, columns4-10. The outline of this block is a rectangle. So the output will have 8 rows and 7 columns. The first row of the output is all 8s. The last row (row7) is all 8s. The rows in between have 8s at the first and last positions (columns0 and6 of the output). The inner positions are 8 if the corresponding input cell has 8.\n\nBut how to map the input's cells to the output's cells. The block's columns are 4-10 (inclusive) in the input. So output columns0-6 correspond to input columns4-10. Output rows0-7 correspond to input rows1-8.\n\nSo for each cell in the output (i,j), it corresponds to input row (i+1), column (j+4).\n\nThe output's cell (i,j) is 8 if:\n\n- i is 0 or 7 (first or last row), or\n\n- j is 0 or 6 (first or last column of the output), or\n\n- the input cell (i+1, j+4) is 8.\n\nOtherwise, it's 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example0.\n\nExample0's block is rows2-8 (7 rows) and columns0-6 (7 columns). So output rows0-6 correspond to input rows2-8. Columns0-6 correspond to input columns0-6.\n\nOutput cell (i,j) is 4 if i is 0 or 6, or j is 0 or 6, or input cell (i+2, j) is 4.\n\nChecking Example0's output row0 (all 4s): yes, because it's the first row of the output, which is the outline.\n\nOutput row1: [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]. So j=0 and 6 are 4. The input rows2+1=3, columns0-6. Input row3 is [2,0,0,0,0,0,2]. But the output row1 has 4s at ends. So the outline is formed by the max number, and the inner is 0 unless input has max. But in this case, input row3's columns0 and6 are 2, not 4. So why are the output's edges 4? Because the outline is created by the max number, not the original numbers. So regardless of what the input's block was, the outline is filled with the max number.\n\nSo the outline is a rectangle of the max number, covering the block's outline. Then, inside, if the input has the max number, it's filled in.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nThe block is rows1-8 (8 rows), columns4-10 (7 columns). The output is 8x7.\n\nOutput row0 is all 8s.\n\nOutput row7 (last row) is all 8s.\n\nFor other rows (1-6):\n\n- Column0 and6 are 8.\n\n- Columns1-5 are 8 if the input cell (row=1+i, column=4+j) is 8.\n\nNow, let's check the test input's rows and columns:\n\nFor example, output row0 (all 8s).\n\nOutput row1:\n\nColumns0 and6 are 8. Columns1-5 are determined by input row2 (since i=1 corresponds to input row1+1=2) columns5-9+1=?\n\nWait, output columns0-6 correspond to input columns4-10. So for j in 0-6:\n\ninput column is 4 + j.\n\nSo for output cell (i,j) in rows 0-7 and j 0-6:\n\ninput_row = 1 + i (since input rows1-8 correspond to output rows0-7).\n\ninput_col = 4 + j.\n\nSo for example, output row0 corresponds to input row1 (i=0: 1+0=1).\n\nOutput row0, columns0-6 are input row1, columns4-10.\n\nInput row1: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nColumns4-10 are [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. So output row0 would be all 8s, but according to the outline rule, the first row of the output is all 8s. So regardless of the input's values in the block, the outline is filled with the max number.\n\nThen, the inner cells (not on the outline) are 8 if the input's corresponding cell is 8.\n\nSo for the test input's output:\n\nRow0: all 8s (outline top).\n\nRow7: all 8s (outline bottom).\n\nFor rows1-6:\n\n- Column0 and6 are 8 (outline sides).\n\n- Columns1-5: 8 if input cell (row=1+i, column=4+j) is 8.\n\nLet's construct the test output step by step.\n\nFirst, identify the max number, which is 8.\n\nThe block is rows1-8 (input rows) and columns4-10 (input columns). So output has 8 rows (0-7) and 7 columns (0-6).\n\nRow0: all 8s.\n\nRow7: all 8s.\n\nRows1-6:\n\nEach row starts and ends with 8. Middle columns 1-5: check if input has 8.\n\nLet's go through each output row and column:\n\nOutput row0 (all 8s).\n\nOutput row1:\n\ninput row is 1+1=2. Columns4-10.\n\nInput row2: [1,1,1,0,1,0,8,0,8,0,0,1,8,0,0,0,0].\n\nColumns4-10 are:\n\ncolumns4:1 (input row2[4] = 1)\n\ncolumn5:0 (input row2[5]=0)\n\ncolumn6:8 (input row2[6]=8)\n\ncolumn7:0\n\ncolumn8:8\n\ncolumn9:0\n\ncolumn10:0\n\nSo output row1 corresponds to input row2, columns4-10: [1,0,8,0,8,0,0].\n\nBut since it's row1 (not top or bottom), columns0 and6 are 8. The middle columns (1-5) are:\n\noutput columns1-5: check if input has 8.\n\ninput columns4+1=5 (j=1: 4+1=5): input row2[5] is 0 \u2192 0.\n\nj=2: input column4+2=6 \u2192 row2[6]=8 \u2192 output column2 is 8.\n\nj=3: column7 \u2192 row2[7]=0 \u2192 0.\n\nj=4: column8 \u2192 row2[8]=8 \u2192 output column4 is8.\n\nj=5: column9 \u2192 row2[9]=0 \u21920.\n\nSo output row1 is [8,0,8,0,8,0,8].\n\nBut wait, output columns are 0-6. So for row1:\n\ncolumns0:8.\n\ncolumns1: input column4+1=5 (value 0 \u21920).\n\ncolumns2: input column6 (value8 \u21928).\n\ncolumns3: input column7 (value0 \u21920).\n\ncolumns4: input column8 (value8 \u21928).\n\ncolumns5: input column9 (value0 \u21920).\n\ncolumns6:8.\n\nSo output row1: [8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8].\n\nBut according to the pattern, the outline is the first and last column, and the middle are 8s only where the input has 8s.\n\nRow2:\n\ninput row=1+2=3. Columns4-10.\n\nInput row3: [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,0,8,0,0].\n\nColumns4-10: row3[4] is 1, 5 is0,6 is0,7 is0,8 is0,9 is0,10 is0.\n\nSo the input row3's columns4-10 are [1,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nSo output row2:\n\ncolumns0:8.\n\ncolumns1: input column5 \u21920 \u21920.\n\ncolumns2: input column6 \u21920 \u21920.\n\ncolumns3: input column7 \u21920 \u21920.\n\ncolumns4: input column8 \u21920 \u21920.\n\ncolumns5: input column9 \u21920 \u21920.\n\ncolumns6:8.\n\nSo row2: [8,0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow3:\n\ninput row=1+3=4. Columns4-10.\n\nInput row4: [1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,8,0,0].\n\nColumns4-10: row4[4]=1, 5=0, 6=0, 7=0, 8=0, 9=0, 10=0.\n\nSo output row3:\n\ncolumns1-5: all 0.\n\nSo row3: [8,0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow4:\n\ninput row=1+4=5. Columns4-10.\n\nInput row5: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nColumns4-10: row5[4]=1, others are 0.\n\nSo output row4: [8,0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow5:\n\ninput row=1+5=6. Columns4-10.\n\nInput row6: [0,0,0,0,1,0,8,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nColumns4-10: row6[4]=1, 5=0,6=8,7=0,8=0,9=0,10=0.\n\nSo output row5:\n\ncolumns2 (input column6) is8 \u21928.\n\nSo row5: [8,0,8,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow6:\n\ninput row=1+6=7. Columns4-10.\n\nInput row7: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,8,0,1,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nColumns4-10: row7[4]=1,5=0,6=0,7=0,8=0,9=8,10=0.\n\nSo j=1: input column5=0 \u21920.\n\nj=5: input column9=8 \u21928.\n\nSo output row6: [8,0,0,0,0,8,8].\n\nWait, j ranges from 0 to6. For row6:\n\ncolumns0:8.\n\ncolumns1: input column5 \u21920.\n\ncolumns2: input column6 \u21920.\n\ncolumns3: input column7 \u21920.\n\ncolumns4: input column8 \u21920.\n\ncolumns5: input column9 \u21928 \u21928.\n\ncolumns6:8.\n\nSo row6 is [8,0,0,0,0,8,8].\n\nRow7: all 8s.\n\nBut this results in an output of 8 rows, which is different from the training examples. However, the training examples' outputs have varying row counts. Let's see if this makes sense.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe output for the test input would be:\n\nRow0: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow1: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8]\n\nRow2: [8,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow3: [8,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow4: [8,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow5: [8,0,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow6: [8,0,0,0,0,8,8]\n\nRow7: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs are presented with each row in a separate line. Let's format this correctly.\n\nHowever, looking at the test input, there are other 8s outside the block's outline. For example, input row13 has 8s at positions11 and 13. But according to our mapping, these are outside the block's columns4-10, so they would not appear in the output. Only 8s within the block's columns4-10 and rows1-8 would be considered.\n\nBut wait, the outline includes the block's perimeter, and any 8s within the block's area are included. So the output only considers 8s within the block's rows and columns.\n\nThus, the final output would be as constructed above.",
