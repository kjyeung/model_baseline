        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the given input lists into the output lists, and then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by analyzing the training examples to understand what's going on.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input has a few 8s scattered in a sea of 0s. The output seems to create a structure around those 8s. For instance, in the third row of the input, there's an 8 at position 11. In the output, that row becomes a series of 8s around that position. Similarly, other 8s in the input (like in row 5 and 8) seem to create lines or blocks of 8s in the output. Maybe the pattern is drawing shapes (like rectangles or lines) around each non-zero number in the input.\n\nExample 1's input has a couple of 2s. The output creates concentric rectangles of 2s. The first output row is all 2s, then the next has a border of 2s with 0s inside, and so on, getting smaller each time. It looks like each non-zero number in the input is creating a set of nested squares or rectangles, with the number's value, decreasing in size each time. Wait, but in the output, the numbers are all the same as the input number (2 in this case), so maybe each non-zero number in the input generates a series of expanding squares or layers around it.\n\nExample 2's input has 3s. The output has a large square made of 3s, and some other structures. The input's 3s are at positions that might correspond to the corners or parts of the squares in the output. Maybe each non-zero number is generating a cross or a square expanding from its position.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's output, the 8s form a sort of cross shape. For instance, in the third row of the output, there's a horizontal line of 8s. Then vertical lines. It might be that each non-zero number in the input is creating a plus sign (horizontal and vertical lines) centered at that position. Then maybe additional structures.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 1, the output seems to form nested squares. The first output row is a full row of 2s, which could be the outermost square. Then each subsequent layer is a smaller square inside. The number of layers might correspond to the value of the number. Wait, but in Example 1, the input has a 2, but the output has multiple layers of 2s. However, the 2 in the input is at a certain position, and the output creates a complex structure around it. Maybe each non-zero number creates a diamond or a square pattern around it, scaled by the number's value.\n\nWait, let's look at the positions of the non-zero numbers in the inputs and how they translate to the outputs.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 8 at row 2, column 11 (0-based index?), and in the output, that's part of a horizontal line of 8s. Also, there's another 8 in row 5, column 14, and another in row 8, column 16. In the output, those positions are part of larger structures. Hmm. Maybe each 8 in the input is creating a horizontal line and a vertical line intersecting at that point. Like a plus sign. But looking at the output, the third row (input's third row) has a horizontal line of 8s. The input's 8 is in the middle (column 11 of 23 elements, so position 11 is the 12th element, maybe the center). Then the output's third row is filled with 8s from column 8 to 16? Wait, not exactly. Let me check:\n\nInput for Example 0 has an 8 in row 2, column 11 (assuming rows and columns are 0-indexed). The output for row 2 is:\n\n[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nWait, that's the third row (index 2) of the output. It starts with 0,0,8, then some 0s and 8s. Maybe the 8 in the input is generating a cross shape. But the output seems more complex. Alternatively, maybe each 8 in the input is part of creating a larger structure, like a maze-like pattern with corridors and walls.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, they seem to form a kind of maze or grid structure with the non-zero numbers. For example, in Example 1's output, the 2s form a series of nested rectangles, each smaller than the previous. The number 2 in the input might determine the pattern's depth or layers. But since the input has multiple 2s, how do they combine? In Example 1's input, there are three 2s: one at row 11, column 13 (0-based?), another at row 13, column 10, and another at row 15, column 9. The output seems to create a complex nested pattern, perhaps combining these positions into a single structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero number in the input represents a point that generates a certain geometric shape in the output. For example, if the input has a number N at position (x,y), the output draws a shape (like a diamond or square) of size N around that point. But the examples don't seem to align exactly with that. For instance, in Example 0, the 8s in the input lead to structures with multiple 8s around them, but the output 8s are more extensive than just a single layer. Alternatively, maybe the number itself isn't the size but the value to fill, and the positions of the input numbers act as centers for certain patterns.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input, there are 3s at row 4, column 12; row 8, column 8; row 12, column 4. The output has a large square made of 3s. The output's first few rows are filled with 3s in a square pattern, but then there's a break. Maybe the input positions are acting as corners of a square. For example, the three 3s in the input might form three corners of a square, and the output fills in the square. But that's not exactly matching. Alternatively, each 3 in the input could be part of a cross or a line that forms the square in the output.\n\nAnother approach: let's compare the input and output dimensions. For Example 0, the input has 23 rows and 23 elements per row. The output is also 23 rows and 23 elements. Similarly for Examples 1 and 2. The test input has 28 rows and 28 elements, so the output should also be 28x28. The pattern likely applies to grids of varying sizes, adjusting based on the input's dimensions.\n\nLooking at the test input, there are three 4s: in row 12, column 7; row 18, column 13; and row 23, column 19. If the pattern is similar to previous examples, these 4s would generate some structure in the output. For example, perhaps each 4 creates a cross shape, or nested squares, or some other pattern based on the number 4.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0, the output creates a kind of 3D maze-like structure with 8s forming walls. The positions of the input 8s correspond to certain parts of this maze. Similarly, Example 1's output forms nested squares, which could be layers of 2s, perhaps with the input 2s positioned at certain key points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a cellular automaton that starts with the input's non-zero cells and applies certain rules. For example, each non-zero cell might expand in certain directions based on their value. But the outputs don't look like simple expansions. They seem more structured.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the first row is all 2s. Then the second row starts with 0, then 2s except the last element. The pattern forms a kind of recursive frame. The number 2's position in the input might determine where these frames start. But how?\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the 2s are at (11,13), (13,10), and (15,9). The output's structure seems to be a series of nested rectangles, each smaller by two units on each side. The first rectangle is the full row of 2s. Then each inner rectangle is indented by 1 on each side. The number of layers might correspond to the distance from the center or the number of input points. Alternatively, the input's 2s could be control points that define the layers.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero number in the input represents a \"seed\" that generates a certain number of concentric rectangles (or another shape) around it. For example, the number 2 in Example 1 might generate a series of rectangles, each step reducing the size. The number 8 in Example 0 could generate a different structure.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's output, there are horizontal and vertical lines of 8s. Let's see:\n\nIn the output of Example 0, the third row has a horizontal line of 8s from column 2 to column 20, but with some gaps. Wait, looking at the third output row:\n\n[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nHmm, that's not a solid line. It has 8s at positions 2,5,8,11-17,20. Maybe it's a combination of multiple patterns. Alternatively, each 8 in the input is part of a larger structure. For example, the 8 in row 2, column 11 of the input might generate a cross centered at that position, with horizontal and vertical lines. But the output's row 2 has multiple 8s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero number in the input is part of a grid that forms a larger pattern when connected. For instance, the 8s in Example 0's input might form points that are connected to form walls in a maze-like structure.\n\nAnother angle: the output in Example 0 has 8s forming a kind of H-shaped structure. Maybe each 8 in the input is part of a letter or symbol. But the letters would vary based on input positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each non-zero number in the input creates a diamond shape (like a square rotated 45 degrees) around its position. The size of the diamond could be determined by the number's value. But in Example 0, the number is 8, and the output has large structures, while in Example 1, the number is 2, and the structures are smaller. But Example 2 uses 3 and the output structures are also larger. So maybe the number doesn't determine the size but is the value to fill.\n\nWait, the output for Example 1 is filled with 2s, which is the same as the input number. Similarly for Examples 0 and 2. So the non-zero numbers in the input are used as the fill value in the output. So the pattern is to create some structure(s) using the input's non-zero numbers as the value, and their positions as the starting points.\n\nNow, the key is to figure out what structure is created based on the input positions. Let's see the positions of the non-zero elements in the inputs:\n\nExample 0:\n\n- Row 2, column 11 (0-based)\n- Row 5, column 14\n- Row 8, column 16\n\nIn the output, these positions are part of lines of 8s. For example, in the third output row (row 2), there's a horizontal line of 8s that includes column 11. Similarly, other rows with 8s might be related to the input positions.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a combination of horizontal and vertical lines passing through each non-zero input cell. For example, each non-zero cell creates a horizontal line and a vertical line in the output, forming a cross. Then, overlapping crosses create more complex structures. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 8 at row 2, column 11 would create a horizontal line in row 2 and a vertical line in column 11. But looking at the output row 2, it's not a full horizontal line. It has 8s at certain intervals. So maybe not a full cross.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be creating a grid of plus signs centered at each non-zero input cell. For example, each non-zero cell is the center of a plus sign (horizontal and vertical lines) of length determined by the cell's value. But in Example 0, the value is 8, but the lines are longer than 8. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to create a maze-like structure where each non-zero input cell is a node, and the output connects them with corridors. The corridors could be horizontal and vertical lines connecting the nodes. For example, in Example 0, the three 8s form a sort of connected structure with horizontal and vertical lines. Let's see:\n\nIn the output of Example 0, there's a horizontal line in row 2 (starting from column 2, then at 5, 8, 11, etc.), and vertical lines at columns 2, 5, 8, 11, 20. Maybe each input 8 is part of a larger grid system where lines are drawn between them.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a bitmap where each non-zero input cell is part of a larger character or symbol. For example, the 8s in Example 0 form the number '8' in a digital display style. But looking at the output, it's hard to see that.\n\nAnother idea: the output could be a reflection or transformation of the input. For instance, the input's non-zero cells are mirrored or rotated in some way. But Example 0's input has a few 8s, and the output has many more, so it's not a simple reflection.\n\nLet me think about Example 1. The input has three 2s. The output has nested squares. The first row is all 2s, then each subsequent row has a border that steps inward. The number of layers might correspond to the number of 2s in the input. But there are three 2s, and the output has multiple layers. Alternatively, the positions of the 2s determine where the squares start or end.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero cell in the input generates a square (or another shape) around it, and the output is the union of all such shapes. For Example 1, the three 2s might generate squares that overlap to form the nested pattern. Let's see:\n\nThe input 2s are at (11,13), (13,10), and (15,9). If each generates a square around their position, perhaps the combination creates the nested structure in the output. For example, the first square is large, centered at (11,13), and the others add smaller squares. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a maze where each non-zero input cell is a key point, and the corridors are generated based on Manhattan distance or other criteria.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in how the output is structured. For Example 0's output, the first few rows have 8s at positions that form vertical lines. For instance, column 2 has 8s in rows 0,1,2,... up to row 10. Then column 5 has 8s in rows 0-10. Similarly for column 8, 11, etc. This suggests vertical lines at certain columns, and horizontal lines at certain rows. The same applies to Example 1 and 2.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the first row is all 2s (a horizontal line). Then rows alternate between having 2s on the borders and stepping inward. The vertical lines are at the edges and then step inward each layer. This looks like a set of concentric squares, each smaller than the previous.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is: for each non-zero cell in the input, draw a set of concentric squares (or another shape) around it, with the number of squares equal to the cell's value. Wait, but in Example 1, the input is 2, and the output has multiple layers. But the output's layers are more than 2. So maybe the cell's value determines the thickness or the number of layers. Alternatively, the value is just used as the fill value, and the structure is based on positions.\n\nWait, in Example 1, all the output cells are filled with 2, which is the same as the input's non-zero value. So the value determines the fill, not the structure's parameters. The structure is determined by the positions of the non-zero cells.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input cells:\n\n- Row 11, column 13 (0-based) has a 2.\n- Row 13, column 10 has a 2.\n- Row 15, column 9 has a 2.\n\nThe output's structure seems to start with a full square (row 0 all 2s), then each layer steps inward. The positions of the input 2s might correspond to the corners of these layers. For example, the first layer (outermost) is the entire grid, then the next layer starts at (1,1), etc. But how do the input positions relate to this?\n\nAlternatively, the input's 2s are positioned in such a way that they form the innermost points of the nested squares. For example, the innermost square is around row 15, column 9. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern might be that the input's non-zero cells are the centers of the concentric squares. For Example 1, if each 2 is the center of a square, the output would have squares expanding from each center. But when there are multiple centers, the squares would overlap, creating a more complex pattern. However, in Example 1's output, the squares are perfectly nested, suggesting a single center. So maybe the input's non-zero cells are arranged in a way that their combined effect creates the nested pattern.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to think of another angle. The output for Example 1 has a series of nested squares that get progressively smaller. The number of layers could correspond to the number of non-zero cells in the input. But Example 1 has three non-zero cells and the output has several layers. Alternatively, each non-zero cell adds a layer. But that's not clear.\n\nWait, looking at the output of Example 1:\n\n- The first row is all 2s.\n- The second row starts with 0, then 2s except the last element.\n- This pattern continues, each layer stepping inward by 1 on all sides.\n\nThe number of layers here seems to be 12 (since the grid is 23x23, and the innermost layer is a single cell). But how does this relate to the input's 2s? The input's 2s are positioned at (11,13), (13,10), (15,9). These are not the centers of the grid. The grid's center would be row 11, column 11 (for 23 elements). So perhaps the input's 2s are placed in a pattern that generates these concentric squares.\n\nAlternatively, the input's 2s are part of a diagonal or specific pattern that when processed, creates the nested squares. For instance, the first 2 is at row 11, column 13, which is near the center but slightly to the right. The second is row 13, column 10 (down and to the left), and the third is row 15, column 9 (further down and left). Maybe these positions are part of a spiral or diagonal that defines the layers.\n\nThis is quite complex. Let's think about the test input. The test input has three 4s at positions (12,7), (18,13), and (23,19). The grid is 28x28. If the pattern is to create concentric squares around each of these points, filling with 4s, the output would have overlapping squares. But perhaps the structure is similar to Example 1, where the output is a set of nested squares, but with the fill value 4.\n\nAlternatively, each 4 in the input generates a cross shape (horizontal and vertical lines) of length 4 in each direction. For example, from the input's 4 at (12,7), the output would have a horizontal line from column 7-4=3 to 7+4=11 in row 12, and a vertical line from row 12-4=8 to 12+4=16 in column 7. Then overlapping lines from other 4s would form a grid.\n\nBut looking at Example 0, the 8s in the input generate longer lines. For example, the 8 in row 2, column 11 may generate a horizontal line spanning several columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the number in the input cell determines the length of the lines drawn from that cell. For example, an 8 would draw a line of length 8 in all four directions (up, down, left, right). But in Example 0, the output's third row has multiple 8s, which could be the result of multiple lines overlapping. However, the 8 in row 2, column 11 would create a horizontal line from column 3 to 19 (8 in each direction), but the output's third row has 8s at varying positions. So this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number is the radius of a square. For example, a 2 would create a square of radius 2 around the cell. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: The outputs in the examples seem to have a recursive structure. Each layer is a frame that's smaller than the previous. For instance, Example 1's output is a series of nested frames. The number of frames could be determined by the input's non-zero numbers. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the input's non-zero numbers are used to determine the starting point of drawing these frames. For example, each non-zero number's position is a corner of the frames. But in Example 1, the 2s are positioned at (11,13), (13,10), (15,9), which might form a diagonal that defines the corners of the frames.\n\nBut this is quite vague. Let's try to think of the test input. It has three 4s at positions (12,7), (18,13), (23,19). If the output is a series of nested frames (like in Example 1), the test output might be similar but with 4s instead of 2s. The frames would start from the outermost layer and step inward, creating nested squares. The positions of the 4s could be the centers or corners of these squares.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s in the input are used to define the layers. For example, each 4 adds a layer to the structure. Since there are three 4s, the output would have three layers. But in Example 1, there are three 2s and the output has more layers, so this might not fit.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the key is that the output is a set of rectangles (or other shapes) connected in a certain way, with the non-zero input cells acting as control points. For example, in Example 0, the 8s are positioned such that they form a path or a connected structure, and the output draws that structure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a bitmap where the non-zero input cells are part of a larger image, like digits or letters. But this seems unlikely given the varying sizes.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the output of Example 0. The third row (index 2) has a sequence of 8s: starting at column 2, then 5, 8, 11, etc. These positions increase by 3 each time (2,5,8,11,14,17,20). This might suggest a step of 3. Similarly, other rows have similar patterns. For example, row 0 and 1 have 8s at columns 2 and 20. Maybe the pattern is to create vertical lines every 3 columns and horizontal lines every 3 rows, starting from the input's non-zero positions.\n\nIf that's the case, then the input's non-zero cells are used as anchors to generate a grid with lines spaced at intervals determined by the cell's value. For example, an 8 in the input would create lines every 8 units. But in Example 0, the spacing between 8s in the output is 3, which doesn't match 8. So this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, the number in the input cell determines the spacing between the lines. For example, a 8 could mean lines every 8 units, but Example 0's output has lines closer than that.\n\nAlternatively, the number is irrelevant except for indicating the fill value. The structure is determined by the positions of the non-zero cells. For example, each non-zero cell generates a cross (horizontal and vertical lines) at its position, and the output is the union of all such crosses. Let's test this:\n\nIn Example 0, the input has three 8s. Each would generate a cross. The output's third row (where one of the 8s is) has a horizontal line through that position. Similarly, vertical lines would be present. However, the output's third row has multiple 8s, which could be where the crosses from different input cells intersect. For example, if each 8 creates a cross, their overlapping would form more complex structures.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, there are 8s in columns 2,5,8,11,14,17,20 in row 2. That's every 3 columns. So maybe each input 8 generates a cross with arms every 3 columns and rows. But why 3?\n\nAlternatively, the number in the input cell determines the step size for generating lines. For example, an 8 would create lines every 8 steps, but in Example 0, the steps are 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting quite challenging. Let's try to think of the test input. It has three 4s. If the pattern from Example 1 applies, the output would be a series of nested squares filled with 4s. The first few rows would be all 4s, then each subsequent row would have a border stepping inward. The number of layers would depend on the grid size. Since the test input is 28x28, the layers would step inward until they reach the center.\n\nAlternatively, the test output would have multiple structures based on the positions of the 4s. For example, each 4 generates a cross, and their overlaps create a more complex pattern.\n\nBut given that the training examples have different structures for different numbers, maybe the pattern is that each non-zero number in the input creates a diamond shape (like a square rotated 45 degrees) centered at that position, with the size determined by the number. For example, 8 would create a large diamond, 2 a smaller one. The diamonds are filled with the number's value.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, there's a large square made of 3s. The diamond shape might not fit, but perhaps the square is the filled area. If the input's 3s are at certain positions, the output fills a square around them.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero number generates a square with the number's value as the side length. For example, a 3 would generate a 3x3 square centered at the input cell. But Example 2's output has larger squares, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number is the radius of a square. For example, a 3 would create a square of radius 3 (total size 7x7) around the cell. But again, not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps the best approach is to look for common elements in the training outputs and extrapolate.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 8s form a pattern where each input 8 is part of a horizontal and vertical line in the output. The lines are spaced at intervals. For example, in row 2, the 8s are at positions 2,5,8,11,14,17,20. The spacing between these is 3. Similarly, in row 5, the 8s are at 14 and others. Maybe each input 8 generates a horizontal line at its row, with 8s every 3 columns, and a vertical line at its column with 8s every 3 rows. Then overlapping lines from multiple 8s create a grid-like structure.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the output forms nested squares, which could be generated by the input 2s spaced in a way that each square steps inward by a certain amount. The 2s in the input might be positioned at the corners of these squares.\n\nIn Example 2's output, the 3s form a large square, possibly generated by the input 3s at different positions.\n\nAssuming that the pattern is to create a grid where each non-zero input cell generates horizontal and vertical lines spaced at intervals equal to the cell's value, but the examples don't exactly fit this. For instance, in Example 0, the 8s are spaced 3 apart, but the cell's value is 8, which doesn't match. So this is probably not correct.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's output, the 8s form a pattern that resembles a barcode, with vertical lines at regular intervals. Similarly, Example 1's output has nested squares, and Example 2's output has a large square. The commonality might be that each input's non-zero cells are used to draw a specific pattern, like a barcode, nested squares, or a large square, with the value determining the pattern's parameters.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to proceed. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to hypothesize that the output is a series of concentric squares (like in Example 1), with the number of layers determined by the input's non-zero cells' positions, and the fill value being the input's number.\n\nFor the test input, which has three 4s, the output might be a series of concentric squares filled with 4s. The first row would be all 4s, then each subsequent row steps inward by one cell on each side, creating nested squares. The number of layers would be until the center of the grid is reached. Given that the grid is 28x28, there would be 14 layers (since 28/2=14). But how do the input's 4s influence this? Maybe each 4 contributes to the layers. But this is just a guess based on Example 1.\n\nAlternatively, the test output would be similar to Example 1's output, but with 4s instead of 2s, and the nested squares adjusted for the larger grid size.\n\nGiven the test input's 4s are at (12,7), (18,13), and (23,19), perhaps these positions are used to generate the concentric squares. The first square is the outermost, and each subsequent square steps inward. The fill value is 4.\n\nBased on this, the test output's first few rows would be filled with 4s, then each layer steps inward. The vertical positions where the input 4s are located might be the centers of these squares. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, each 4 in the input generates a cross (horizontal and vertical lines) centered at that position, and the output combines these crosses. The test output would thus have multiple crosses of 4s overlapping.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the concentric squares hypothesis, similar to Example 1, but with 4s. Here's how the output might look for the test input:\n\nThe first row would be all 4s. Each subsequent row would have a border of 4s, stepping inward by one cell on each side. The input's 4s might be positioned to mark the corners or centers of these squares. The final rows would have smaller squares until they reach the innermost layer.\n\nHowever, since the test input has three 4s at different positions, it's possible that the output combines structures from each. For example, each 4 generates its own set of concentric squares, and overlapping regions have 4s. But this would create a complex pattern, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the input's 4s are placed in such a way that they define the layers of the concentric squares. For instance, the first 4 at (12,7) starts the first square, the second at (18,13) the next, and so on. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to write the output based on the concentric squares pattern, similar to Example 1 but with 4s. The output would have nested squares of 4s, starting from the outermost and stepping inward each layer. Each row would start with a certain number of 4s, decreasing as we move inward.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a grid of zeros with a few numbers (like 8, 2, 3, etc.) placed in specific positions. The output grids are much more complex, filled with the same number in a structured pattern. \n\nLet's start with Example 0. The input has three 8s in different rows. The output seems to create a sort of maze-like structure with 8s forming borders and lines. The 8s in the output form a kind of expanding square or maybe a recursive pattern. Similarly, in Example 1, the input has 2s scattered, and the output creates concentric squares of 2s. For Example 2, the 3s in the input result in a similar pattern but with 3s, and there's a larger block in the output.\n\nHmm, maybe the pattern is that each number in the input acts as a seed to draw a certain shape, like a rectangle or a border around it. The position of the number determines where the shape starts, and then the output builds a structure expanding outward from those seeds. The number's value determines the structure's size or the level of recursion. \n\nIn Example 0, the 8 in the middle row might create a central square, and the other 8s add more structures. The output's lines of 8s might be forming a series of nested rectangles or borders. Each seed number might be creating a frame or a box around its position, and overlapping areas combine them. \n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the 2s in the input are at positions (11,14), (13,15), (15,9), etc. The output forms layers of squares, each layer getting smaller. The top of the output is a full line of 2s, then each subsequent layer has 2s forming a border, then another inside, and so on. This looks like concentric squares, each smaller than the previous, with the number 2. The depth of the squares might correspond to the positions of the input numbers. \n\nIn Example 2, the input has 3s at positions (4,12), (8,8), (12,4), and (19,19) in the test input. The output forms a larger square with 3s, then smaller squares inside. The positions of the 3s in the input might determine where these squares start. For instance, the 3 in row 4, column 12 (assuming 0-based indexing) could be the center of a square, and the others add more layers or different positions. \n\nWait, maybe each number in the input represents a certain distance or a radius. For example, a number 8 might create a border that's 8 units away from the center. Or perhaps the number indicates the size of the square or the level of recursion. Alternatively, the number could be the value that fills the area, and the position determines the starting point for expanding in all directions until a boundary is hit. \n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is creating a cellular automaton where each non-zero input cell acts as a seed, and the output is generated by expanding around those seeds, filling cells according to some rule. The rule could be that each cell in the output is the maximum of the surrounding cells from the input, but that doesn't quite fit. \n\nWait, looking at the first example's output, the 8s form vertical and horizontal lines. For instance, the third row in the output has a horizontal line of 8s in the middle. The input's 8 is in the middle of that row. So perhaps each 8 in the input creates a cross (vertical and horizontal lines) centered at that position, extending until they hit another structure. Then, overlapping crosses combine their paths. \n\nBut in Example 1, the output has layers of squares made of 2s. Each input 2 could be generating a square around it. For example, the first 2 in row 11, column 13 (assuming 0-based) might create a square that's larger, and the other 2s add smaller squares inside, creating the concentric pattern. \n\nAlternatively, each input number creates a diamond-shaped area (like a Manhattan distance) around it. The number's value might determine the radius. For example, an 8 could create a larger diamond than a 2. But the output in Example 0 doesn't look like diamonds. \n\nAnother thought: The output might be a combination of all the input numbers' positions, each contributing a certain structure. For instance, each input number draws a rectangle or a cross in the output. The output is the union of all these structures. \n\nLooking at Example 0's input: there are 8s at positions (2,11), (5,14), (8,17). In the output, those positions are part of vertical and horizontal lines. The 8 in row 2, column 11 in the input leads to a horizontal line in row 2 of the output, spanning columns 2,5,8, etc. Wait, the output's first few rows have 8s in columns 2,5,8. Maybe each 8 in the input creates a vertical line in the same column and horizontal lines in the rows where the input 8s are located. \n\nAlternatively, the output could be a grid where each cell (i,j) is 8 if in the input, there exists a cell (k,l) such that the Manhattan distance between (i,j) and (k,l) is less than or equal to some value based on the input's number. But the input numbers are the same (8, 2, 3), but their positions vary, so maybe the number's value is the radius. Wait, in Example 0, the 8s might be creating a cross that extends 8 cells in all directions. But the output structures don't seem to be that large. \n\nWait, perhaps the number in the input indicates the size of a square or a frame. For example, an 8 in the input creates a square frame of 8s around it. But how? Let's check. In Example 0's input, the 8 in row 2, column 11. The output row 2 has 8s in columns 2,5,8,11, etc. Maybe the 8s in the output are arranged in a pattern where each input 8 creates a plus sign that's 8 units in each direction. But the actual positions in the output don't seem to align with that. \n\nAnother angle: The outputs have a lot of 8s forming borders and corridors. Maybe each input number represents a certain \"room\" or \"path\" in a maze-like structure. The position of the number determines where the room is, and the output is a maze generated based on those positions. \n\nAlternatively, the input numbers are control points for a recursive pattern. For example, each number in the input is a center point for a certain recursive division of the grid. Like a quadtree split, where each split is determined by the input numbers. But how that would translate into the output patterns is unclear. \n\nWait, looking at the test input: the input has 4s at positions (12,7), (18,13), and (23,19). The output should follow the same pattern as the examples but with 4s. The expected output would likely form concentric squares or expanding structures around each 4. \n\nIn Example 1's output, the 2s form layers. The first row is all 2s, then each subsequent row has a border of 2s that steps inward. This looks like a series of nested squares. The number of layers might correspond to the number of input seeds. Or each input seed adds a layer. But in Example 1, there are 4 input 2s, and the output has multiple layers. \n\nAlternatively, each input number creates a square around it, and overlapping squares create the more complex patterns. For instance, in Example 1, the 2s in different positions create squares that overlap, forming the concentric pattern. \n\nWait, let's think about the output for Example 1. The first row after the input is all 2s. Then the next row starts with 0, followed by 2s, etc. It seems like each layer is a square that is one cell smaller on each side. The input 2s are possibly at key positions that initiate these layers. \n\nAlternatively, each input number's position is the center of a diamond shape (like a square rotated 45 degrees) with the radius equal to the number's value. But in Example 1, the input has 2s, but the output structures are larger than radius 2. \n\nHmm, maybe the number in the input is not directly related to the size but is a fixed value. Like, the presence of any number in the input (regardless of its value) triggers the same pattern, but the value determines the color (so 8, 2, 3 are just different colors for the same pattern). Wait, in Example 0, the output uses 8s, Example 1 uses 2s, and Example 2 uses 3s. So the number in the input is the value used in the output pattern. So the pattern's structure is the same regardless of the number, but the number determines what digit is used. \n\nSo the key is to find the pattern structure, which is the same across examples, just using the number from the input. The structure seems to be a series of concentric squares or frames. For example, in Example 1's output, the outermost layer is a full row of 2s, then a square with a border of 2s, then another inside, etc. \n\nBut how do the input positions relate to the output structure? Let's check where the input numbers are. \n\nIn Example 0, the input has 8s at rows 2,5,8. The output has vertical lines of 8s in columns 2,5,8, etc. Wait, in the output of Example 0, the first three rows start with 0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8... which suggests that the 8s are placed every 3 columns. Maybe each input 8 is in column 11 (in row 2), column 14 (row 5), and column 17 (row 8). If the output's columns are spaced 3 apart, that might be a clue. But how does that relate to their positions?\n\nAlternatively, each input number's column index determines the horizontal positions in the output. For instance, in Example 0, the input 8 is in column 11 (assuming 0-based). The output's first row has 8s at columns 2,5,8,11, etc. But 11 is part of that sequence. Wait, 2,5,8,11... each step is 3. So maybe the columns where 8s are placed in the output are multiples of 3 plus 2. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the input's positions are transformed into output positions by some formula. For example, the input's row and column indices are scaled or shifted to create the output structure. \n\nBut perhaps the pattern is that each input number generates a cross shape (horizontal and vertical lines) centered at its position. For Example 0, the 8 in row 2, column 11 creates a vertical line in column 11 and a horizontal line in row 2. But the output has multiple lines. Wait, looking at the output rows in Example 0, row 0 has 8s at positions 2,5,8, etc. So maybe each input 8 is part of a grid that's divided into sections, and the output fills certain sections with 8s. \n\nAnother idea: The output is a grid where each cell (i,j) is the maximum of all input numbers that are in the same row i or column j. So, for Example 0, since there's an 8 in row 2, column 11, every cell in row 2 and column 11 would be 8. But in the output, row 2 has 8s in multiple columns. So that's not it. \n\nWait, looking at the output of Example 0, the 8s form a kind of maze with horizontal and vertical lines. The structure seems to have a central cross, then other lines branching off. Maybe the input 8s are used to generate a certain fractal-like pattern, such as a H-tree or similar recursive structure. \n\nAlternatively, the output is a bitmap where the input numbers are control points, and lines are drawn between them. For example, connecting the input 8s in some order to form a path, and filling in the regions. But this seems complicated. \n\nLet me try to think of each example's input positions and how they relate to the output. \n\nExample 0's input has 8s at:\n\n- Row 2, column 11\n\n- Row 5, column 14\n\n- Row 8, column 17\n\nIn the output, looking at row 2, the 8s are in columns 2,5,8,11, etc. So maybe each input 8's column is part of a sequence where columns increase by 3 each time. So the output in row 0 has 8s at columns 2,5,8,11,14,17, etc. Similarly, rows 0,1,2 have 8s in those columns, forming vertical lines. Then, in the output's row 5, there's an 8 in column 14 (same as input), and the structure around it expands into a square. \n\nMaybe the output is a combination of vertical and horizontal lines at intervals determined by the input positions, with the input numbers acting as anchors. For example, each input number creates a vertical line in its column and horizontal lines in certain rows, creating a grid-like structure. \n\nIn Example 1's input, there are 2s at:\n\n- Row 11, column 13\n\n- Row 13, column 11\n\n- Row 15, column 9\n\nIn the output, the 2s form concentric squares. The first square is a full row of 2s (row 1), then the next square starts at row 3 and has borders, and so on. The positions of the input 2s might correspond to the centers of these squares. For instance, row 11 and column 13 could be the center of the first square. But the output starts the pattern from the top, so maybe the input positions are part of a recursive pattern where each square is nested within the previous one. \n\nAlternatively, the input numbers are placed at certain levels of a recursive split. For example, the grid is divided into quadrants, and each input number determines whether a split occurs, creating borders. But this is vague. \n\nLet's consider the test input. It has 4s at:\n\n- Row 12, column 7\n\n- Row 18, column 13\n\n- Row 23, column 19\n\nAssuming that the output pattern is similar to previous examples, the output should have concentric squares or frames made of 4s. For example, each 4 in the input could generate a square around its position, and overlapping squares form the pattern. \n\nAlternatively, each input number generates a cross (horizontal and vertical lines) in the output, centered at their position, with the length of the lines determined by the number's value. But in Example 0, the number is 8, and the lines are longer. Wait, in Example 0's output, the horizontal lines span multiple columns. For example, row 2 has 8s from column 2 to 21 (or so). But the input's 8 is at column 11. If the number 8 determines the length, perhaps the lines are 8 units long in each direction. So, from column 11-8=3 to 11+8=19. But in the output row 2, the 8s are at columns 2,5,8,11,14,17,20, which don't fit that. \n\nHmm, maybe the number's value isn't directly related to the length but is just the value to fill. So the pattern structure is the same regardless of the number, but the number is used as the fill value. \n\nThe key is that the output seems to build a structure where each input number's position starts a new layer of a nested square pattern. For example, each input number adds a layer to the structure. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\n- The first row is all 2s.\n\n- The third row starts with 0, then 2s forming a border.\n\n- Each subsequent layer steps inward, creating concentric squares.\n\nThe number of layers could correspond to the number of input numbers. Example 1's input has four 2s, but the output has multiple layers. Maybe each input number is placed at a corner of a square, and the output builds layers inward. \n\nAlternatively, the input numbers are at specific positions that form a diagonal, and the output creates a spiral or stepped pattern around that diagonal. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's look for a different approach. \n\nAnother observation: In each example's output, the first occurrence of the number is in the first few rows, then the pattern expands. For Example 0, the first three rows have 8s in specific columns. Then, further down, there are larger structures. \n\nWait, perhaps the output is a grid that's divided into regions, and each input number's position starts a new region. The regions are filled with the number, and the structure is built by combining these regions. \n\nAlternatively, the output is a maze where each input number is a key point, and the paths connect these points with the number's value. \n\nAnother angle: The output's structure resembles a binary matrix where each cell is 1 (the number) if it's part of a certain Manhattan distance from the input positions, but again, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the output is a reflection of the input's positions across certain axes. For instance, each input number's position is mirrored horizontally and vertically to create a symmetric pattern. \n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 8s are in rows 2,5,8. In the output, there are 8s in rows 0,1,2, etc., forming vertical columns. So maybe each input row is mirrored upwards and downwards. \n\nAlternatively, the output is a kind of cellular automaton where each input cell generates a certain pattern. For example, a cell with a number creates a cross in the output, and overlapping crosses form more complex structures. \n\nIn Example 1's output, the 2s form concentric squares. The outermost layer is row 1, then layer 3, etc. Each layer is a square that's two rows and columns smaller than the previous. The input 2s could be placed at the corners of these squares. \n\nBut how does that relate to the input's positions? In Example 1's input, the 2s are at (11,13), (13,11), (15,9), etc. These positions seem to form a diagonal. Perhaps the output's concentric squares are centered around this diagonal. \n\nAnother thought: The output's structure is a Sierpi\u0144ski triangle or another fractal pattern, with the input numbers serving as initial points. But the examples don't clearly show a fractal. \n\nAlternatively, the output is a series of overlapping rectangles, each centered at an input number's position, with the height and width determined by the number's value. For example, an 8 creates a rectangle that's 8 units tall and wide. But this doesn't align with the examples. \n\nWait, let's think about Example 2's input. It has 3s at (4,12), (8,8), (12,4), and the test input's 4s are at (12,7), (18,13), (23,19). The output for Example 2 shows a large square of 3s and other structures. The test input's 4s are positioned in a way that might form a similar pattern but scaled. \n\nPerhaps each input number creates a square frame around its position, with the size increasing based on the number's value. For example, 3 creates a 3x3 square, but in Example 2's output, the squares are larger. \n\nAlternatively, the number's value determines the distance from the center of the square. For example, a 3 in the input creates a square that's 3 layers thick. \n\nBut the examples don't clearly show this. For instance, Example 1's output has multiple layers of 2s, but the input numbers are 2s. \n\nMaybe the number in the input is irrelevant except for its position, and the output is a pattern of concentric squares where each square is offset based on the input positions. \n\nAlternatively, the input numbers are used to create a Voronoi diagram where each cell is filled with the input number, and the output shows the regions closest to each seed. But Voronoi regions would be polygons, and the examples show more structured patterns. \n\nAnother observation: In each example, the output starts with a horizontal line of the number at the top (like Example 0's first output row is [0,0,8,0,0,8,...], Example 1's second row is all 2s). Then, subsequent layers step inward. This suggests that the pattern is a series of nested squares, each stepping inward by a certain amount. The input numbers are placed at key positions that initiate these squares. \n\nBut how to determine which positions trigger the squares. For Example 0, the input has three 8s. The output's first row has 8s every three columns. Maybe each input 8 in a certain row determines the columns where vertical lines are drawn. \n\nAlternatively, the input numbers are placed at the centers of the squares in the output. For example, in Example 0's output, the central part of the pattern is around row 2, column 11. But the output's structure is more complex. \n\nThis is challenging. Let's summarize:\n\nThe output patterns involve nested squares or frames filled with the input number. The input numbers are placed at specific positions that seem to determine where these frames are centered. The number itself determines the value used to fill the frames. \n\nFor the test input, which has 4s, the output should create a similar pattern of nested squares filled with 4s, centered around the input positions. \n\nSo, applying this to the test input:\n\nThe input has 4s at positions (12,7), (18,13), and (23,19). The output would likely have concentric squares around these positions, filled with 4s. \n\nBut how exactly? Looking at the previous examples, each input number's position seems to contribute to a larger pattern. For example, in Example 1, the input 2s are placed along a diagonal, and the output forms nested squares along that diagonal. \n\nPerhaps the test input's 4s are positioned such that their output forms a series of squares that expand from those points. For example, the first 4 at (12,7) starts a square, then the next at (18,13) adds another layer, and so on. \n\nAlternatively, each 4 in the input creates a cross shape (horizontal and vertical lines) centered at their positions. Overlapping crosses form the pattern. \n\nBut looking at the previous examples, especially Example 0, the output isn't just crosses. It has more complex structures, including horizontal lines and blocks. \n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the vertical lines are spaced every 3 columns. The input 8s are in column 11, which is part of this pattern (11 = 3*3 + 2). Maybe the columns where vertical lines are drawn are determined by the input positions modulo some number. \n\nAlternatively, each input number's column and row are used to generate a grid of lines or blocks. For example, input at (x,y) generates lines at x \u00b1 k and y \u00b1 k for various k. \n\nAlternatively, the output is a union of all possible rectangles formed by pairs of input positions. For example, each pair of input positions forms a rectangle, which is filled with the number. But this would create many overlapping rectangles. \n\nAnother idea: The output is a bitwise OR of all possible squares anchored at each input position. Each input number generates a square of certain size, and the output combines them. \n\nBut given the time I've spent and the need to generate an answer, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each input number generates concentric squares around its position, and the output combines these squares. The number of layers or the size of the squares could be determined by the number's value. However, in the examples, the number's value doesn't seem to affect the size (since in Example 1, 2s create larger squares than in Example 0 with 8s). Therefore, perhaps the number's value is merely the fill value, and the pattern is based on the positions. \n\nFor the test input with 4s at (12,7), (18,13), and (23,19), the output would have concentric squares around these points, filled with 4s. The squares would form a pattern similar to the training examples but adjusted for the new positions. \n\nAlternatively, each input number's row and column are used to determine the boundaries of squares. For example, the output's first square is determined by the first input number, then the next square is determined by the next, and so on. \n\nGiven that the test input has three 4s, perhaps the output will have three layers of squares around each of these positions. The squares would overlap and combine to form a complex pattern. \n\nGiven the complexity, the best approach is to mimic the pattern from the training examples. For example, in Example 1, the output starts with a full row of 2s, then creates nested squares. For the test input with 4s, the output might start with a full row of 4s at some point and then create nested squares. \n\nAlternatively, the pattern involves creating a spiral or expanding from the input positions. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. The test input's 4s are positioned in a diagonal-like manner: (12,7), (18,13), (23,19). The row and column differences are increasing by 6 and 6 each time. Perhaps the output forms a diagonal series of squares around these positions. \n\nConsidering Example 2's output, which has 3s forming a large square and smaller ones, the test input's output may have a similar structure with 4s. \n\nTherefore, the final answer would be a grid where the 4s form nested squares or expanding frames around the positions of the input 4s. Each 4 in the input seeds a new part of the pattern, leading to a complex structure filled with 4s in a step-wise or nested manner.",
