        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a list of lists (like a grid), and the output replaces some of the 0s with 3s. I need to find out where those 3s are placed and why.\n\nStarting with Example 0. Let's compare the input and output. For instance, in the second row of input, the original is [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2], and the output changes the fourth 0 to 3. Then in the third row, the fourth element becomes 3 again. Then, looking at the fourth row of input, which has a bunch of 0s except the first and last elements. The output replaces all those middle 0s with 3s. But not all rows have all 0s turned to 3s. So maybe there's a specific pattern here.\n\nHmm. Maybe the 3s are filling in the 0s that are enclosed by other numbers. Like, if a 0 is surrounded by non-zero elements (like 8 or 2), then it's replaced with 3. But how do we determine which 0s to replace?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output. The rows where all the 0s become 3s are those where there's a lot of 0s in the middle. Maybe those are the rows where the 0s form a contiguous block that's surrounded by 8s and 2s on both ends. For example, in the fourth row of input example 0, the first element is 8 and the last is 2. So all the 0s in between become 3s. Similarly, in the fifth row, same thing. But in the next rows, like the seventh row, the last element becomes 8, and the 0s in between become 3s. So maybe the 3s are filling the 0s that are between two non-zero elements (8 or 2) in the same row.\n\nWait, but in the second row of Example 0's input, the first element is 8, then three 0s, then 2. The output replaces the fourth 0 (which is the third 0) with 3. Hmm, not sure. Maybe the direction is different. Alternatively, maybe it's checking for 0s that are between two non-zero elements in the same row, but not necessarily the entire row. Like, maybe a group of 0s that start after a non-zero and end before another non-zero.\n\nAnother approach: looking for regions of 0s that are \"sandwiched\" between non-zero elements in each row. So, for each row, any 0s that are between a non-zero (8 or 2) on the left and a non-zero on the right would be replaced with 3. But how to determine the boundaries.\n\nWait in Example 0's first row of the input (the second line), the input is [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. The output is [8,0,0,3,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. So the fourth element (index 3) is changed from 0 to 3. Then, the next element is 2. Wait, that's the first occurrence of a non-zero after the 0s. So the first three 0s are followed by a 2. But in the output, only the third 0 (index 3) is turned into 3. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in each row, the leftmost and rightmost 0s (those adjacent to non-zeros) are left as 0, but the 0s that are deeper in the middle are replaced. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input. The fifth row input is [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2], output is [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]. So all the 0s between 8 and 2 are replaced with 3. But in other rows, like the third row of Example 2's input, [8,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,2], the output is [8,8,0,3,8,0,0,0,0,2]. So here, the third 0 (index 3) is replaced with 3. The next elements are 8, 0, etc. So maybe the rule is that any 0s that are in between two non-zero elements in the same row get replaced with 3, but only if they're part of a contiguous block that's enclosed by non-zero on both ends.\n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm is: for each row, look for sequences of 0s that are flanked by non-zero (8 or 2) elements on both ends. Then, replace all 0s in those sequences with 3. But how to determine the sequences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's that in each row, if the first and last elements are non-zero (8 or 2), then all the 0s in between are replaced with 3. But in some cases, like in Example 0's fourth row, the first element is 8 and the last is 2, so all 0s in between are turned to 3. But in the second row of Example 0's input, the first element is 8, and the fifth element is 2. So between them, there are 0s. But in the output, only the fourth element (third 0) is turned to 3. Wait, that doesn't fit. Because between 8 (index 0) and the first 2 (index 4) in row 2, the elements are 0,0,0,0. The output changes the third 0 (index 3) to 3. The rest remain 0. So maybe the pattern isn't as simple as replacing all 0s between the first and last non-zero in the row.\n\nHmm. Let's look at another example. In Example 1's input, the fourth row is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]. The output changes the 0s to 3s starting from index 1 to 10 (assuming the row has 12 elements). Wait the input is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8] and output is [2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8]. So all 0s between 2 and 8 are replaced with 3s. But in the same example's third row input: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8]. The output is [2,0,0,0,3,3,0,8,0,0,0,8]. So here, some 0s are replaced. So in that row, the first element is 2, then 0s, then a 0, then 8, etc. The output replaces the fourth and fifth 0s (indices 4 and 5) with 3. That's between 2 and 8? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is looking for 0s that are between two non-zero elements in the row, but not necessarily the entire row. Like, if there's a 0 surrounded by non-zero elements on both sides (left and right) within the same row, then replace those 0s with 3. But how to determine the span.\n\nWait, maybe the 3s are filling in the \"valleys\" between the peaks. For example, in a row, if there's a non-zero element, followed by some 0s, then another non-zero, then the 0s in between become 3. But perhaps it's per row, and it's only the 0s that are between two non-zero elements. So for each 0 in the row, check if there's a non-zero to the left and a non-zero to the right (not necessarily adjacent). If so, replace the 0 with 3.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. Take Example 0's second input row: [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. The output is [8,0,0,3,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. The first 0s (indices 1,2,3). Let's check each 0:\n\n- Index 1: left is 8 (non-zero), right. For index 1, to the right, are there any non-zero beyond? The next element is 0, then 0, then 2. So for index 1, the next non-zero is at index 4. So from index 1 to 4, there are 0s. So all the 0s between 8 (index0) and 2 (index4) would be turned into 3. But the output only turns index3 into 3. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait in the output, the first three 0s (indices1,2,3) are changed to 0,0,3. So why only the third becomes 3. That doesn't fit the previous idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are replacing 0s that are adjacent to a non-zero on the left and right in the same row. For example, if a 0 is between two non-zero elements (immediately next to them), then it's replaced. But that's not the case here. Or maybe the 3s are replacing 0s that are in the middle of a \"bridge\" between non-zero elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are placed in 0s that are part of a region that is enclosed by non-zero elements in all directions (like a flood fill). But the examples are grids, so maybe the transformation is replacing 0s that are completely surrounded by 8s or 2s in the grid. But looking at the examples, that's not the case. For example, in the fourth row of Example 0's input, the 0s are all between 8 and 2, and they get replaced. But if the surrounding includes vertical neighbors, maybe not. Because in the fourth row of Example 0's input, the rows above and below have 0s as well. So it's unclear.\n\nWait maybe the pattern is horizontal. For each row, look for the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements. Then, any 0s that are between these two non-zero elements are replaced with 3. Let's check this.\n\nIn Example 0's second input row: [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. The leftmost non-zero is 8 (index0), the rightmost non-zero is 2 (index11). So all 0s between 0 and 11 would be replaced. But in the output, only the third 0 (index3) becomes 3, others remain 0. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements in the row, and the 0s between them are replaced, but only if they are not adjacent to any 8 or 2 in the vertical direction. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait maybe the pattern is that the 3s are replacing the 0s that form a horizontal line between two non-zero elements, but in the same row, and the line is the first occurrence of such a block. Or perhaps the 3s are inserted where there's a horizontal run of 0s that is between two non-zero elements in the same row, but the run is longer than a certain length. But in Example 0's fourth row, the entire row's 0s are between 8 and 2, so they are replaced. But in the second row, some are replaced. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: look at the positions of 3s in the output. In Example 0's output, the third row (input row 3) is [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]. The input here has 8, followed by a bunch of 0s, then 2. All 0s between them are replaced with 3. Similarly, in Example 1's fourth row input, the output replaces all 0s between 2 and 8 with 3. So perhaps the rule is: in a row, if the first element is non-zero (8 or 2) and the last element is non-zero (8 or 2), then replace all 0s in between with 3.\n\nWait, let's check this. Example 0's input row 0 (first input line) is all 2s, output is same. So no 3s. Correct. Row 1 in input example 0: [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. The first element is 8, but the last is 2. So between them are 0s and other elements. Wait, the last element is 2. So the entire row starts with 8 and ends with 2. But in between, there are 0s and 2s. So according to this hypothesis, any 0s between the first and last elements (8 and 2) would be replaced. Let's see the output: [8,0,0,3,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. So the first three elements after 8 are 0,0,0. But in the output, the third 0 (index3) is 3, others remain 0. So that doesn't fit the hypothesis. Because the entire row starts with 8 and ends with 2, but not all 0s in between are replaced.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is more nuanced. Let's look at another example. Example 2's fifth row input is [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. The output is [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]. Here, the first element is 8, last is 2. All the 0s in between are replaced. So that fits the hypothesis. But in example 0's second input row, the first element is 8, last is 2. But the output doesn't replace all 0s. So why is that?\n\nLooking at example 0's second input row: [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. The first element is 8, last is 2. So according to the hypothesis, all 0s between 8 and 2 would be replaced. But in the output, only the third 0 (index3) becomes 3, and the rest are 0. Wait, but after index3, there's a 2. So the 0s are from index1 to 3, followed by 2. So maybe the rule is to replace 0s that are between the first non-zero (8) and the next non-zero (the 2 at index4). So between index0 (8) and index4 (2), there are 0s. So replace those 0s (indices1-3) with 3. But in the output, only index3 becomes 3. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each row, starting from the left, after the first non-zero (8 or 2), replace any 0s until the next non-zero (excluding that next non-zero) with 3. Similarly, from the right side. Or maybe fill the 0s between the first and last non-zero elements in the row.\n\nWait in example 0's second input row:\n\nIndices 0:8, 1:0, 2:0,3:0,4:2,5:2,6:0,7:2, etc. So the first non-zero is 8 at 0. The next non-zero after that is 2 at index4. So the 0s between 0 and4 are indices1-3. Replace those with 3? But in the output, only index3 becomes 3. Why? That doesn't fit. So maybe the rule is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are replacing 0s that are in positions where the cell is surrounded by non-zero cells in all four directions (up, down, left, right). But looking at example 0's fourth row input, which is [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. The output replaces all 0s with 3. But in this row, the 0s are between 8 and 2, and perhaps their positions are surrounded by non-zero cells in adjacent rows. But I'm not sure. Let's check the surrounding rows.\n\nIn example 0, the fourth row is:\n\nInput row: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRows above and below:\n\nRow3: [8,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,2,0,2]\n\nRow4: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow5: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nSo in row4, the 0s are in the middle. The rows above and below have 0s in some positions. So maybe it's not about vertical surrounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the 0s being part of a horizontal line that is enclosed between non-zero elements. For example, if a 0 is between two non-zero elements in the same row, but not at the edges. But this is vague.\n\nLooking at example 1's fifth input row: [2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]. The output is [2,2,2,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,8]. So the fourth and fifth 0s are replaced with 3. The first non-zero is 2 (index0), next non-zero after that is 0s followed by 8 at index11. But why replace indices4 and 5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replacing the 0s that are in the middle of two non-zero elements in the same row. For example, in example1's fifth row input, the first three elements are 2, then 0s, then the rest are 0s until 8. So maybe the 0s between the first 2s and the 8 are replaced with 3, but only a certain number. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 3s are filling in the 0s that are part of the inner area of a rectangle formed by non-zero elements. For example, if there's a rectangle surrounded by 8s and 2s, then the 0s inside are replaced with 3. But that's a 2D structure, which might be harder to detect.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples, it seems that the 3s are added in rows where the first and last elements are non-zero (8 or 2), and the 0s between them are replaced. But when the first and last are non-zero, then replace the 0s between them. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input row3: first is 8, last is 2. Output replaces all 0s with 3.\n\nExample0's input row1: first is8, last is2. Output changes some 0s to 3.\n\nWait row1's last element is 2. So between 8 and 2, but in the row, there are other non-zero elements (like 2s at index4 and 5). So maybe the algorithm is to look for the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements in the row and replace all 0s between them with 3. So for example, in row1:\n\nLeftmost non-zero is index0 (8). Rightmost non-zero is index11 (2). So all 0s between them should be replaced. But in the output, some 0s are replaced and others are not. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut wait, in row1's input, the elements are 8 followed by 0s, then 2,2, then 0,2, etc. The leftmost is 8 (index0), rightmost is 2 (index11). So according to the hypothesis, replace all 0s between 0 and 11. But in the output, only index3 is replaced. So the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let me try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs, it seems that the 3s are placed in horizontal runs of 0s that are bounded by non-zero elements. For example, in example0's row4, all the 0s between 8 and 2 are replaced. In example2's row5, all 0s between 8 and 2 are replaced. But in other cases, only some 0s are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a matter of the 0s being in a contiguous block that's between two non-zero elements in the same row, and that block is longer than a certain length. For example, in example0's row4, the block is 10 zeros, so replaced. In row1, the block is 3 zeros, but only one is replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 3s are replacing 0s that are in between two non-zero elements in the same row, but not adjacent to any other non-zero elements in the same row. For example, if a 0 is flanked by non-zero on the left and right, but in the same row, then replace it. But looking at example0's row3 output, the 0s are all replaced with 3, even if they are consecutive. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the 0s that are part of a path from the top to the bottom. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are forming a diamond shape or some other geometric pattern. Looking at example0's output, the 3s form a vertical band in the middle of the grid. Example1's output also has a vertical band of 3s. Example2's output has a horizontal line of 3s in the middle row. So maybe the 3s are forming a vertical column in the center of the grid.\n\nWait example0's grid is 12x12. The 3s are in the middle rows. For example, row3 to row8, columns 1-10 (approx) are filled with 3s. Similarly, example1's middle rows have 3s in the middle columns. Example2's middle row (row5 and 6) are filled with 3s. So perhaps the 3s are filling a central vertical region.\n\nBut the test input is 14x14. Applying that pattern, the middle columns would have 3s. But how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are in the rows where the leftmost and rightmost elements are non-zero. For example, in each row, if the first and last elements are non-zero, then replace all 0s in between with 3. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's row0: all 2s. So first and last are 2. Replace 0s? There are no 0s. Correct.\n\nRow1: first is 8, last is 2. Replace all 0s between them. The input row1 has [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. The 0s are at positions1,2,3,6. Between 8 (0) and 2 (11), the 0s are at positions1-3,6. But in the output, only position3 is replaced with 3. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nExample0's row3: first is 8, last is 2. All 0s between them are replaced with 3. Which fits the hypothesis.\n\nExample1's row4: first is2, last is8. All 0s replaced with3. Fits.\n\nExample1's row3: first is2, last is8. Input row is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8]. Wait, the last element is 8. So between 2 and 8, the 0s are positions1-6. But in the output, positions4-5 are replaced with 3. So the hypothesis doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to look for another pattern.\n\nAnother approach: look at the differences between the input and output in each example. For each row, which 0s become 3s?\n\nIn Example0's input row1 (second line):\n\nInput: [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nOutput: [8,0,0,3,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nThe fourth element (index3) is changed to 3.\n\nIn this row, the 0s are at positions1,2,3,6. The output changes only position3.\n\nWhy?\n\nLooking at the surrounding elements in the same row. After position3, there's a 2 at position4. So maybe the rule is that if a 0 is followed by a non-zero (2 or8) in the same row, replace it with 3. But position3 is followed by 2. So that 0 is replaced. Similarly, in the same row, position6 is 0, followed by 2. But in output, it's not replaced. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, look at the next row (row2) of input example0:\n\nInput: [8,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,2,0,2]\n\nOutput: [8,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,2,2,0,2]\n\nHere, position3 is replaced with 3. The next element is 0 (position4). So why is that replaced? Because position5 is 2, so the 0 at position3 is before the 0 and then 2. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace the 0s that are immediately before a non-zero in the same row. For example, any 0 that is followed by a non-zero (except the last element) becomes 3. But in example0's row1 input, the 0s at positions1,2,3 are followed by 0,0,2. So only the third 0 (position3) is followed by 2, thus replaced. That fits. Then, in row2's input, position3 is followed by 0 (position4), which is followed by 2. So maybe only the 0s that are immediately followed by a non-zero. For example, in row1's input, position3 is followed by 2 (position4), so replaced. In row2's input, position3 is followed by 0 (position4), which is followed by 2 (position5). So maybe the 0s that are in a position where the next element is non-zero.\n\nBut in example0's row3 input, all the 0s are between 8 and 2, and all are replaced with 3. So in that case, the 0s are followed by other 0s until the end, but they are replaced. So this contradicts the previous hypothesis.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is a combination of vertical and horizontal checks. For example, a 0 is replaced with 3 if it is between two non-zero elements in the same column. But that would require checking the rows above and below, which is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are replacing 0s that are part of a path from the top to the bottom of the grid. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the test input. It's a grid with 14 rows and 14 columns. The first row is all 8s, the last row is all 2s. The middle rows have varying patterns. Applying the pattern from the examples, perhaps the 3s will appear in the rows where the first and last elements are non-zero, and replace the 0s in between.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows:\n\nRow0: all 8s. So no 0s, output remains.\n\nRow1: [8,8,8,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,2,2]. First element is8, last is2. So between them are 0s and other elements. According to the previous examples, the 0s in between might be replaced with 3s where they are between non-zero elements. For example, the 0s at indices4 and5 (between 8 and8?), but not sure.\n\nBut how to proceed. Maybe the best way is to code the pattern based on the examples. Looking at all the examples, it seems that the 3s are replacing 0s in rows where the first and last elements are non-zero (8 or 2), and then all the 0s between the first and last elements are replaced with 3. However, there are exceptions where even in such rows, not all 0s are replaced. For example, in Example0's row1 and row2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that if the first and last elements of a row are non-zero (8 or 2), then replace all 0s in that row with 3. But in Example0's row1, the first is8 and last is2, but only some 0s are replaced. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are only placed in the middle of the grid. For example, in Example0's output, the 3s are in the middle rows, forming a vertical band. Similarly, in Example1, the 3s are in the middle rows, and in Example2, the middle row is filled with 3s. So maybe the pattern is to replace 0s in the middle rows of the grid, forming a vertical band.\n\nLooking at Example0: the grid has 12 rows. The rows from index3 to index8 (0-based) have 3s. Example1 has 12 rows, and the middle rows (index4 and index8) have 3s. Example2 has 10 rows, and the middle rows (5 and6) are filled with 3s. So it seems that the 3s are placed in the middle third or middle section of the grid.\n\nSo for the test input, which has 14 rows, the middle rows would be around rows 5-8. Looking at the test input's rows:\n\nRow2: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow3: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow4: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]\n\nRow6: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow7: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow8: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow9: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow10: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow11: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]\n\nSo the middle rows are rows6-7 perhaps. If the pattern is to replace the 0s in the middle rows, then rows 5-9 (assuming 14 rows, middle is around rows6-7) would have their 0s replaced with 3s. For example, row6 input is [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. If first element is8, last is2, replace all 0s between them with3. So output would be [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]. Similarly for other middle rows.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, not all middle rows are filled with3s. For example, example0's row4 and others have all 0s replaced. So perhaps the rule is that for rows in the middle third of the grid, and where the first and last elements are non-zero, replace all 0s between them with3.\n\nAlternatively, the test input's row6 is [8,0,...,0,2]. So first element 8, last element 2. All the 0s between them would become3. So the output row would be [8,3,3,...,3,2].\n\nSimilarly, row3: [8,0,...,0,2]. Output would be [8,3,...,3,2].\n\nBut looking at example0's row3, which is [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2], output is [8,3,3,...,3,2]. So fits.\n\nThen for the test input's rows that have first and last elements as non-zero (8 or2), and are in the middle of the grid, the 0s between are replaced with3.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow0: all 8s \u2192 no 0s.\n\nRow1: [8,8,8,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,2,2]. First is8, last is2. So replace 0s between them. The 0s are at indices4,5,9,10. So the output row would be [8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,8,2,2].\n\nRow2: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. First is8, last is2. Replace all 0s between with3. So output becomes [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2].\n\nRow3: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. Output all 0s replaced with3: [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2].\n\nRow4: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]. First is8, last is2. So replace 0s between. Indices3-10 are0s. So replaced with3: [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2].\n\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]. First is8, last is2. So replace 0s between. Indices2-10 are0s. So output: [8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2].\n\nRow6: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. All 0s replaced with3: [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2].\n\nRow7: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. First is8, last is2. Replace 0s between. So indices2-12 are0s. Output: [8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2].\n\nRow8: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. Same as row7. Output: [8,8,3,...,3,2].\n\nRow9: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. Same as row7. Output: [8,8,3,...,3,2].\n\nRow10: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. Same as row6. Output: [8,3,...,3,2].\n\nRow11: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]. First is8, last is2. Replace 0s between. Indices2-10 are0s. So output: [8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2].\n\nRow12: [8,8,0,2,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]. First is8, last is2. So replace 0s between. But there are 0s and other elements. Let's see. The 0s are at indices2,4,7,8,9,10. The first element is8, last is2. So between them, any 0s would be replaced. So indices2 is 0, but the next element is2. So only that 0 is replaced. Then index4 is0 (between 2 and2), but that's between two non-zero elements. So maybe replaced. But in the output of example0's row1, the 0s between 8 and2 are replaced. So perhaps in this case, all 0s between first and last would be replaced. So row12 would be [8,8,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,2,2].\n\nRow13: all 2s. No changes.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. Looking back at the training examples, for example, Example0's row1 input has 0s between 8 and2, but only some are replaced. But according to this hypothesis, all would be replaced. Which is conflicting.\n\nWait, in Example0's row1 input: [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. The first element is8, last is2. The elements in between are 0s and 2s. According to the hypothesis, all 0s between 8 and2 would be replaced. So in the output, positions1,2,3,6 would be 3. But the actual output is [8,0,0,3,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. So only position3 is replaced. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nSo what's different in that case? The row has other non-zero elements (2s) in between. So the presence of other non-zero elements in the row breaks the replacement.\n\nAh, maybe the rule is that between the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements in the row, any 0s are replaced with3, but excluding any other non-zero elements in between. So, for example, in Example0's row1, the leftmost is8, rightmost is2. Between them are 0s and 2s. The leftmost is at0, and the next non-zero to the right is at4 (2). So between 0 and4, the 0s are replaced with3. Then, after4, there are 2s, so no replacement. Similarly, the next non-zero is at6 (0, then2 at7). So between4 and7, there's a 0 at6, but since the rightmost non-zero is at11, maybe the 0s between7 and11 are not replaced.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that replace all 0s that are between two non-zero elements, where the two non-zero elements are the first and last of the row, and there are no other non-zero elements in between. Which is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are replacing the 0s that are in the same column as the middle of the grid. For example, in example0's output, the 3s are in the central columns. But example0 is a 12x12 grid. The middle columns would be around 5-6. But the 3s are spread across multiple columns. Not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s that are part of a \"valley\" between two non-zero elements in the same row. For example, if there's a non-zero element followed by some 0s, then another non-zero element, then the 0s in between are replaced with3. This would handle multiple such valleys in a row.\n\nFor instance, in Example0's row1 input: [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. The first valley is between8 and the first 2 at index4. So the 0s between8 and2 would be replaced with3. So indices1-3 would become3. But in the output, only index3 is replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the valleys are between consecutive non-zero elements. For example, in the row [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2...], the first valley is between8 and2 at index4. So the 0s between them (indices1-3) are replaced. Then, after the 2s, there's a0 at index6 followed by2. So the valley between index6 and7's 2 would replace the0 at6. But in the output, only index3 is replaced.\n\nThis doesn't match.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's take the training examples and see if there's a vertical pattern.\n\nIn Example0's input, the first row is all 2s, output same. Then, the next rows have 8 on the left and varying elements on the right. The output has 3s in the middle columns.\n\nIn Example0's output, the 3s appear in columns 1-10 for rows3-8. So columns1-10 (assuming 12 columns). For example, row3: [8,3,3,...,3,2]. So columns1-10 are3s.\n\nExample1's output has 3s in columns4-5 for certain rows. For example, row4: [2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8]. Columns1-10 are3s.\n\nExample2's output row5: [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]. So columns1-8 are3s.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that the 3s are placed in the middle columns of the grid. For example, in a 12-column grid, middle columns are 4-7. But in example0's output, it's columns1-10. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s form a vertical band that is as wide as possible between the left and right non-zero elements. For example, in rows where the left is8 and right is2, the middle columns are filled with3.\n\nIn test input's row3: [8,0,0,...,0,2]. So between8 and2, all 0s are replaced with3.\n\nIn test input's row1: [8,8,8,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,2,2]. Here, the 0s are at indices4,5,9,10. Between8 at0 and2 at13. But there are other 8s in between. So the 0s between the first8 and the last2 are replaced. But there are 8s in the middle, which would split the 0s into separate regions.\n\nFor example, in row1 of the test input, the 0s are at 4,5 (between 8 and8) and 9,10 (between8 and8). So maybe those are valleys between non-zero elements. So each group of 0s between non-zero elements in the same row would be replaced with3. So in row1's input, the 0s at4,5 are between8 (index3) and8 (index6), so replaced with3. Similarly, 0s at9,10 are between8 (index8) and8 (index11), so replaced with3. So the output row1 would be [8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,8,2,2]. Which matches the first example's pattern where between non-zero elements, the 0s are replaced with3.\n\nSo the rule is: for each row, every group of 0s that is between two non-zero elements (8 or2) is replaced with3.\n\nSo for any sequence of 0s that is flanked by non-zero elements on both ends (left and right) in the same row, replace all 0s in that sequence with3.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn Example0's row1 input: [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. The first three 0s are between8 (index0) and2 (index4). So they are replaced with3. But in the output, only index3 is replaced. Hmm, this contradicts.\n\nWait, perhaps the 0s are replaced with3 only if they are between two non-zero elements in the same row, but not necessarily all. Maybe only the first group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 0 that has a non-zero to the left and a non-zero to the right in the same row is replaced with3.\n\nFor example, in Example0's row1, the first three 0s (indices1-3). The first 0 (index1) has left=8 (index0), but right=0 (index2). So no. The second 0 (index2) has left=0 (index1), right=0 (index3). The third 0 (index3) has left=0 (index2), right=2 (index4). So only the third 0 has a non-zero to the right, but not to the left. So according to this rule, it wouldn't be replaced. But in the output, it is replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that a 0 is replaced with3 if either the left or right neighbor is non-zero. But in Example0's row1, the 0 at index3 is followed by 2. So maybe it's replaced because it is adjacent to a non-zero on the right. But the output changes that 0 to3. Similarly, in row2's input, the 0 at index3 is followed by0, but then a 2. So maybe it's replaced because there's a non-zero in the same row, not necessarily adjacent.\n\nThis is really challenging.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the 3s are placed in the same positions where the 0s are surrounded by 8s and 2s in all directions. But checking for that in the examples, it's not the case. For example, in Example0's row3, all 0s are between8 and2, but vertically, there are 0s above and below.\n\nAt this point, perhaps I should look for the pattern in terms of the test input and see what the answer would look like.\n\nThe test input's rows:\n\nRow0: all 8s \u2192 no change.\n\nRow1: [8,8,8,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,2,2]. The 0s at4,5 are between8 and8. So replaced with3. The 0s at9,10 are between8 and8. So replaced with3. So output row: [8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,8,2,2].\n\nRow2: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. The 0s are between8 and2. All replaced with3. Output row: [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2].\n\nRow3: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. All 0s replaced with3. Output: [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2].\n\nRow4: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]. 0s between8 and2 \u2192 replaced. Output: [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2].\n\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]. 0s between8 and2 \u2192 replaced. Output: [8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2].\n\nRow6: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. All 0s replaced. Output: [8,3,3,...,3,2].\n\nRow7: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. 0s between8 and2 \u2192 replaced. Output: [8,8,3,3,...,3,2].\n\nRow8: Same as row7 \u2192 same output.\n\nRow9: Same as row7 \u2192 same output.\n\nRow10: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. Same as row6 \u2192 replaced.\n\nRow11: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]. 0s between8 and2 \u2192 replaced. Output: [8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2].\n\nRow12: [8,8,0,2,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]. The 0s here are at indices2,4,7-10. Let's see:\n\n- Index2: between8 (index1) and2 (index3) \u2192 replaced with3.\n\n- Index4: between2 (index3) and2 (index5) \u2192 replaced with3.\n\n- Indices7-10: between2 (index6) and2 (index11) \u2192 replaced with3.\n\nSo output row: [8,8,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,2,2].\n\nRow13: All 2s \u2192 no change.\n\nThis seems to fit the examples. For instance, Example0's row1 input:\n\n[8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. The 0s at1-3 are between8 and2. So replaced with3. But in the output, only index3 is3. Hmm, this conflicts. But perhaps the examples have exceptions where only some valleys are filled. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any group of 0s that are between two non-zero elements in the same row are replaced with3, regardless of other elements.\n\nIn Example0's row1 input: [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. The first three 0s are between8 and2 (index4). So replaced. The next 0 (index6) is between2 (index5) and2 (index7). So replaced. So output should be [8,3,3,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2]. But the actual output is [8,0,0,3,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. So only two 0s are replaced. This suggests that the rule is not to replace all such 0s.\n\nThis is really perplexing. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the rule is to replace 0s between the first and last non-zero elements of each row, and see if the test input's expected output matches this.\n\nAssuming that, the test input's output would have the 3s in the rows where first and last are non-zero, and between them, all 0s are replaced.\n\nSo applying that to the test input, the answer would be:\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,8,2,2]\n\n[8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\n[8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\n[8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2]\n\n[8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2]\n\n[8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\n[8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\n[8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\n[8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\n[8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\n[8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2]\n\n[8,8,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,2,2]\n\n[8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the pattern here. Let's look at the training examples first. Each example has an input grid and an output grid. The output grids have some 3s introduced where there were 0s in the input. Let me compare the input and output for each example to see what's changing.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a grid with mostly 2s, 8s, and 0s. The output replaces some 0s with 3s. Let me check the rows. For instance, in the third row of the input (index 3 maybe?), the input is [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] and the output becomes [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]. So all the 0s in the middle are replaced with 3s. But looking at other rows, maybe it's only certain 0s that are replaced. Wait, maybe it's the 0s that are in between 8s or 2s. Like in the first row of Example 0's input: the output changes the fourth element to 3. The input row is [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2], output is [8,0,0,3,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. Hmm, the fourth 0 becomes a 3. But the next 0s in that row are left as 0. So maybe there's some kind of path or area that's being filled with 3s. Maybe the 3s are filling the 0s that are enclosed by 8s and 2s?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The output has some 3s replacing 0s. For instance, in the second input row (third row maybe?), [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8] becomes [2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8]. So the 0s in positions 4 and 5 become 3s. But then in row 4, the entire middle section is 3s. Wait, maybe it's about the largest possible region of 0s that are surrounded by 8s or 2s? Or perhaps it's the 0s that are on the inner parts, not touching the edges.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output, the third row (index 3) is all 3s except the first and last elements which are 8 and 2. So that row's 0s are all converted to 3s. Similarly, in Example 1's row 4, all 0s become 3s. Maybe those rows are completely surrounded by non-zero numbers (8 or 2) on both ends, so the 0s are enclosed. Then in the rows where the 0s are not fully enclosed, only parts are replaced. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that 3s replace 0s that are part of regions completely enclosed by 8s and 2s. So like a flood fill, where any 0s that are enclosed by the boundaries (8 and 2) get turned into 3s. But how does that work across the grid?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input. The input row 5 is [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], and the output is [8, 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]. So all the 0s in that row are replaced with 3s. But the row is between 8 and 2. Similarly, in row 3 of Example 2's input, [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2] becomes [8,8,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,2]. Wait, only the fourth element is 3 here. Hmm, maybe not. Maybe it's about the position in the grid. Or perhaps there's a specific direction or layers.\n\nAnother approach: look for when 0s are between 8 and 2. For example, in Example 0's first input row, the 0s between 8 and the first 2 might be converted. Or maybe the 3s are filling the 0s that are in the middle layers of the grid. Like, imagine the grid as a kind of frame, with 8s and 2s forming borders, and the innermost 0s are filled with 3s.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input grid has a structure that's like a diamond or a circle. The top and bottom rows are all 2s and 8s. The middle rows have 0s in the center. Then in the output, those 0s become 3s. So maybe the pattern is to replace all 0s that are enclosed by 8s and 2s in all directions. But how do you determine that for each cell?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are filling the 0s that are in the same row between the first occurrence of 8 (from left) and the next occurrence of 2 (from left), or something like that. Let's take Example 0's first input row: [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. The output is [8,0,0,3,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. So the first 8 is at index 0, then the next 2 is at index 4. The 0s between them are up to index 3. The output changed index 3 to 3. So maybe in each row, between the first 8 and the first 2, the last 0 before the 2 is turned into 3. Then in the middle rows, where there's a run of 0s between 8 and 2 on both ends, all the 0s are replaced by 3s.\n\nBut in Example 0's third row input [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2], the output replaces all 0s with 3s. Here, the row starts with 8 and ends with 2, so all 0s in between are replaced. Similarly, in Example 1's fourth row, [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8], the output is [2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8]. So starts with 2 and ends with 8, and the 0s in between are all 3s. So maybe when a row starts and ends with non-zero (8 or 2), the 0s in between are turned into 3s. But wait, in the first row of Example 0's input, the row starts with 8 and has 2 in the middle. So the 0s after 8 but before the first 2 are replaced, but only the last 0 before the first 2 is turned to 3? Because in that first row of Example 0, the 8 is at index 0, then 0s up to index 3, then 2 at index 4. The output changes index 3 to 3. So maybe the first 8 in the row and the first 2 after it, and the 0s between them are replaced by 3s starting from the 8 up to the position before the 2. But in that case, there are three 0s (indices 1,2,3), but only index 3 is turned to 3. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the longest stretch of 0s that starts after an 8 and ends before a 2. But in Example 0's first row, the first 8 is at 0, then 0s until index 3, then 2 at 4. So the 0s from 1-3, but in the output, only index 3 is a 3. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the columns. Maybe each column is considered. For example, in a column, if there's a 0 that's between an 8 and a 2, then it's replaced with 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s that are completely surrounded by 8s and/or 2s in all four directions (up, down, left, right). But that would require checking neighbors, which might be more complex. But looking at Example 0's third row: all the 0s are in the middle of the row, and the entire row is 8 followed by 0s and ending with 2. So in that row, the 0s are between 8 and 2, and maybe the surrounding rows have 8s and 2s on the same columns, creating an enclosed area. So those 0s are turned into 3s.\n\nBut how to apply that to the test input. Let's look at the test input:\n\nThe test input is a 14x14 grid. Let's see some rows:\n\nFirst row is all 8s. Output will probably remain all 8s.\n\nSecond row: [8,8,8,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,2,2]. The output might have some 3s between the 8s and the 2. For example, the 0s between the 8s and the 2s at the end. But the 2 is at position 12 and 13. So maybe in this row, after the 8s, there are 0s, then 8s again, then 0s, then 8, then 2. Hmm. So perhaps the 0s that are between 8s and the 2s at the end are candidates. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach is to check for each row: if the row starts with 8 (or 2) and ends with 2 (or 8), then replace all 0s between the first non-zero and the last non-zero with 3s. Let's see in Example 0's third row: starts with 8 and ends with 2. All 0s in between are 3s. Similarly, in Example 1's fourth row: starts with 2 and ends with 8. All 0s become 3s. But in Example 0's first row, starts with 8 and ends with 2, but only the fourth 0 (third index) becomes 3. So that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the entire row has a left boundary (8 or 2) and a right boundary (8 or 2), and the 0s in between are replaced. But how to determine the left and right boundaries.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, the leftmost non-zero element and the rightmost non-zero element form the boundaries. Any 0s between them are replaced with 3s. Let's test that.\n\nTake Example 0's first input row: [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. Leftmost is 8 (index 0), rightmost is 2 (index 11). So the 0s between 0 and 11? But in the output, only some are replaced. Wait, the leftmost is 8 at 0, and the rightmost in the input is 2 at 11, but in the row, after index 0, there's a 2 at index 4. So maybe the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements in the row are considered. So for that row, left is 8 at 0, right is 2 at 4. The 0s between 0 and 4 (indices 1,2,3) would be replaced. But in the output, index 3 is replaced to 3, others remain 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the left boundary is the first occurrence of 8 or 2, and the right boundary is the next occurrence of 8 or 2. So for each row, we look for sequences of 0s that are between two 8s or 2s and replace those 0s with 3s. For example, in a row like [8,0,0,0,2,0,8,0,2], the 0s between 8 and 2 (indices 1-3) would become 3s. Then the next 0 between 2 and 8 (index5) would become 3. The 0 after 8 (index7) is between 8 and 2, so becomes 3. But maybe overlapping is handled in a certain way.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's first row input: [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. The output replaces the fourth 0 (index3) with 3. So between 8 (index0) and 2 (index4), there are 0s at indices 1-3. Only the last one (index3) becomes 3. That's confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are filling the areas that form a diamond or hourglass shape. Looking at the output of Example 0, the 3s form a band in the middle. So maybe the pattern is to replace 0s in the middle rows with 3s, but how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, considering the examples, the 3s seem to form a vertical column in the middle. For example, in Example 0's output, the middle columns (around column 5-6) have 3s in the middle rows. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are filling the 0s that are surrounded by 8s and 2s in a cross pattern. Like, if a 0 is in a row that has 8 or 2 on both ends and in a column that has 8 or 2 on both ends, then it's replaced with 3. But that's complex.\n\nAnother idea: in the input, any 0 that is between two non-zero elements (8 or 2) on the same row, but not necessarily the entire row. For example, if in a row there's a segment of 0s between an 8 and a 2, then those 0s are replaced with 3s. But how to handle multiple segments.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output row 1: [8,0,0,3,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. The input row had 8 followed by 0s and then 2. The output changes the last 0 before the first 2 to 3. So maybe in a row, whenever there's a run of 0s between an 8 and a 2 (or 8 and 2), replace the last 0 in that run with 3. But then in the third row, all 0s are replaced. So maybe if the entire row between the first and last element (which are 8 and 2) is 0s, then replace all with 3s.\n\nBut in Example 0's third row, the row starts with 8 and ends with 2, and all in between are 0s, so replaced with 3s. In the first row, starts with 8, then after three 0s, the next element is 2. So in that segment of 0s between 8 and 2, perhaps the last 0 is replaced with 3. The other 0s in the row (like after the 2) remain 0. \n\nSo maybe the rule is: For each row, scan from left to right. Whenever you find a non-zero (8 or 2), then any 0s following it until the next non-zero (8 or 2) are considered. If the run of 0s is between two non-zeros (8 or 2), replace all those 0s with 3s. Wait, but in Example 0's first row, the first non-zero is 8 (index0), then 0s until index4 which is 2. So those 0s from 1-3 are replaced with 3s? But in the output, only index3 is replaced. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Or perhaps only the last 0 in such a run is replaced. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replacing the 0s that are adjacent to non-zero elements. Like, any 0 that is between two non-zero elements (left and right) in the same row is replaced with 3. For example, if a 0 has a non-zero to the left and right, then it's replaced. But in Example 0's first row, the 0 at index3 has 0s to the left (indices1-2) and a 2 to the right (index4). So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAnother observation: in the outputs, the 3s form a vertical line or region. Looking at Example 0's output, the middle columns (columns 3-8) have 3s. Maybe each row has a central region where 0s are replaced with 3s. For example, in a row with length 12, the middle 6 elements (indices 3-8) would be replaced if they are 0s. But this doesn't fit all examples. For instance, in Example 2's output row 5, all 0s are replaced with 3s. The row length is 10, so indices 1-8 are 3s. Hmm, that's more than the middle.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that for each row, the 0s that are between the first occurrence of 8 and the last occurrence of 2 in that row are replaced with 3s. Let's test this.\n\nTake Example 0's first input row: [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. The first 8 is at index0, the last 2 is at index11. But the 0s after the first 2 (index4) are not replaced. So the 0s between the first 8 and the first 2 (index4) would be replaced. So the first 8 and the first 2 in the row. Then the 0s between them are replaced. But in the output, only the 0 at index3 is replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first occurrence of 8 and the first occurrence of 2 in each row. So between those two, the 0s are replaced. For Example 0's first row, first 8 is at 0, first 2 is at 4. The 0s between 0 and4 are indices1-3. In the output, those 0s are 0,0,3. So maybe only the last one is replaced. That doesn't make sense. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to find another pattern. Maybe the 3s are replacing the 0s that are part of the \"interior\" of the grid, i.e., not on the edges. For example, in Example 0's input, the middle rows (rows 3-6) have all their 0s replaced with 3s, forming a band. While the rows near the top and bottom have partial replacements. But how to define \"interior\".\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to replace 0s with 3s if they are in rows that are between rows with 8s and 2s. For example, if the row above has 8s and the row below has 2s, then the 0s in between are filled. But this seems too vague.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input: the first row is all 2s. Then the next rows have 8s and 0s and 2s. The output replaces certain 0s with 3s. It looks like the 3s are forming a diamond shape. So maybe the 3s are in the cells where the Manhattan distance from the center is a certain value. But without knowing the grid size, this might be hard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to replace 0s with 3s when they are surrounded by 8s or 2s in all four directions (up, down, left, right). But this would require checking neighbors. For example, a 0 cell that has non-zero (8 or 2) cells in all four directions would be replaced with 3. Let's check this.\n\nIn Example 0's third row of input: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. All cells except first and last are 0. If this is row 3, then the cells in row3, columns1-10 are 0. Are they surrounded by non-zero cells in all directions? Let's see: \n\nFor cell (3,1): up is row2, which is [8,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,2,0,2]. So cell (2,1) is 0. So no, up is not non-zero. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the 3s are the result of a \"flood fill\" starting from certain points. Like, starting from the edges and replacing certain 0s. But again, not sure.\n\nLet's try to look for a different angle. All the examples have 8s and 2s as the non-zero elements, and 3s are the transformed 0s. Looking at the first example's output, the 3s are introduced in the middle of the rows, surrounded by 8s and 2s. Maybe the rule is that in each row, any 0 that is between an 8 and a 2 (in any order) is replaced with 3.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's first output row, the fourth element is 3. In the input, that's between three 0s and a 2. So the first 8, then 0s, then a 2. The 0 just before the 2 becomes 3.\n\nIn Example 1's first output row, the 0s before the 2 become 3s. For example, in the second row of Example 1's input: [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,8], the output is [2,2,0,0,3,3,0,8,8,0,0,8]. So between the 2s and the 0s and then the 8s. The 0s in positions 4-5 are replaced with 3s, which are between the 0s and the 8s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are filling the 0s that are in the same row and column as certain patterns. For example, for each cell that is a 0, check if the cell above and below are 8 or 2, and the left and right are 8 or 2. But that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replacing 0s that form certain regions. For example, the largest contiguous region of 0s that is enclosed by 8s and 2s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's input row 5: [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], output is all 3s between 8 and 2. So the entire row's 0s are replaced. So when a row starts with 8 and ends with 2, and all in between are 0s, they are replaced with 3s. But in Example 0's third row, that's the case and they are replaced. Similarly, Example 1's fourth row starts with 2 and ends with 8, and the 0s are replaced with 3s.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for each row, if the row starts with an 8 or 2 and ends with an 8 or 2, then replace all 0s between the start and end with 3s. But in cases where the row has other non-zero elements in between, how does that work?\n\nFor example, in Example 0's first row, the row starts with 8 and ends with 2, but there are other 2s in between. The output only replaces the last 0 before the first 2. So maybe the rule is more like: between the first occurrence of 8 or 2 and the next occurrence of 8 or 2 in the same row, replace the 0s in between with 3s.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that for each row, from left to right, when you find a non-zero (8 or 2), then continue until the next non-zero (8 or 2), and replace all 0s in between with 3s. Let's test this:\n\nExample 0's first row input: [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. The first non-zero is 8 at 0. Then the next non-zero is 2 at 4. The 0s between 0 and4 (indices1-3) are replaced with 3s. So in the output, indices1-3 should be 3s. But the output is [8,0,0,3,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]. Only index3 is 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps replace all 0s between the first and last non-zero elements in the row. For Example 0's third row, the first non-zero is 8 and the last is 2, so replace all 0s between them. For the first row, first non-zero is 8, last is 2 (at index 11), but the output doesn't replace all 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the 3s are replacing 0s that are adjacent to 8s or 2s. But in Example 0's third row, all 0s are replaced, which are adjacent to 8 and 2 at the ends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replacing the 0s that are in the same row and column as a diagonal of 8s and 2s. For example, in a diamond shape, the middle 0s are replaced. But how to visualize that.\n\nLet me try to look for another pattern. In Example 0's input, the third row (index3) has 8 followed by 11 zeros (probably not, but perhaps in a 12-element row). The output replaces all those zeros with 3. Similarly, Example 1's fourth row has all zeros replaced. So perhaps the rule is: in a row, if the row starts with 8 or 2 and ends with 2 or 8, and all the elements in between are zeros, then replace those zeros with 3s.\n\nThat fits for those cases. But in other rows where there are zeros interspersed with 8s or 2s, the replacement is only partial. For example, in Example 0's first row, the row starts with 8 and ends with 2, but there are 2s in between. So the zeros are not all between the first and last non-zero elements, so only the first segment of zeros (after the 8 and before the first 2) are partially replaced. \n\nBut in Example 0's first row output, only the third zero in that segment is replaced. Why? Maybe because it's the middle zero. Like, in a sequence of three zeros, the middle one becomes 3. So for a sequence of zeros of odd length, the center one is replaced. For even lengths, maybe the last one?\n\nIn Example 0's first row input, the segment is three zeros (indices1-3). So replacing the middle one (index2) but in the output it's index3 that's replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first zero after the 8 and the last zero before the first 2 are replaced. But in the first row, the segment is 0s from 1-3. First zero is 1, last is 3. So replaced with 3. So that's what the output shows: index3 is replaced. So maybe for a segment of zeros between two non-zero elements (8 or 2), replace the last zero in the segment with 3.\n\nSo the rule could be: For each row, whenever there's a run of zeros between two non-zero elements (8 or 2), replace the last zero in that run with 3.\n\nLet's test this with the examples.\n\nExample 0's first row: the run between 8 and 2 (positions0-4) has zeros at 1-3. Last zero is index3, replaced with 3. Output matches.\n\nExample 0's third row: the entire row between 8 and 2 is zeros. So the last zero is the one before the 2, which is index10. But the output replaces all zeros with 3. So this theory doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the rule varies depending on the length of the zero run.\n\nAlternatively, for any run of zeros between two non-zero elements (8 or 2), replace all zeros in that run with 3s. But then why in Example 0's first row, the zeros between 8 and 2 are not all replaced. So this can't be.\n\nAnother idea: the 3s are introduced in the input where there are exactly three 0s in a row. But that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to replace every third 0 with a 3. But in Example 0's third row, all zeros are replaced, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are replacing 0s that are surrounded by 8s and 2s in some way. For example, in a row, if a 0 is between an 8 and a 2, then replace with 3. But in Example 0's first row, there are three 0s between 8 and 2. All of them should be replaced, but only one is.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another approach. Let's look at the positions of 3s in the output grids.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\nRow 1 (index1): 3 at position3.\n\nRow 3: all positions 1-10 are 3s (except first and last).\n\nRow 4: same as row3.\n\nRows5-6: same.\n\nRow7: 3s except first and last.\n\nRow8: same.\n\nRow9: 3s at position3.\n\nRow10: 3 at position3.\n\nSo the 3s form a vertical line in the middle columns. For a 12-column grid, the middle columns are around 5-6. But in Example0's output, the 3s are in columns 1-10 in row3. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, it's based on the diagonal. For example, in Example0's output, the 3s form a diamond shape where the left and right edges are defined by certain columns.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the 3s are filling the areas where the cell is part of a \"corridor\" between 8s and 2s. For instance, in Example0's input, the 8s and 2s form a kind of hourglass shape, and the 3s fill the narrowest part.\n\nBut how to translate that into code.\n\nAlternatively, think of the grid as layers. The outer layers are 8s and 2s, and the innermost layer's 0s are replaced with 3s. But this depends on the grid structure.\n\nGiven the time I'm spending and the complexity, maybe the pattern is to replace 0s with 3s in the following way:\n\nFor each row, scan from the left until you find an 8 or 2. Then, continue until you find the next 8 or 2. Replace all 0s between them with 3s. Then continue scanning after that next 8/2.\n\nBut wait, in Example0's first row:\n\nInput row: [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nProcessing from left:\n\n- Start at 0 (8). Next non-zero is 4 (2). Replace 0s between 0 and4 with 3s. So positions1-3 become 3. But in the output, only position3 is 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replace only the first 0 after the non-zero. Or the last one. Or every other.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replace the 0s that are adjacent to a non-zero on either side. For example, if a 0 has a non-zero to the left and a non-zero to the right, replace it with 3. So in the first row of Example0's input, the 0 at position3 is between 0s and 2. So the left is 0 (position2), right is 2 (position4). So that's not adjacent to non-zero on both sides. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet's think of it as a grid where 8 and 2 form borders, and the 3s fill the interior. So perhaps the 3s are replacing 0s that are enclosed by 8s and 2s on all four sides. But how to check that for each cell.\n\nAlternatively, for each 0 in the grid, check if there's an 8 or 2 to the left and right in the same row, and above and below in the same column. If so, replace with 3. This would require the 0 to be in a \"cross\" of 8s and 2s.\n\nBut for Example0's row3, all the 0s are replaced. So for those 0s, are there 8s and 2s above and below? Let's see:\n\nRow3's input is [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. The row above (row2) is [8,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,2,0,2]. The row below (row4) is [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. So for a cell in row3, column1, the cells above (row2, column1) is 0, so no. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Let me try to look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern based on the training examples, then apply it.\n\nThe test input is a 14x14 grid. Let's look for rows that start and end with non-zeros (8 or 2). For example, the third row of the test input is [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]. Starts with 8 and ends with 2. According to previous examples, all 0s between them should be replaced with 3s. So in the output, this row would be [8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2].\n\nBut wait, looking at Example0's third row, which starts with 8 and ends with 2, all 0s are replaced with 3s. So perhaps that's the pattern. Let's check other rows in the test input.\n\nAnother test row: row 2 is [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2]. Starts with 8 and ends with 2. The 0s between the first 8 and the first 2 (position12-13 are 2s). Wait, the row starts with 8, then has other 8s and 0s and ends with 2, 2. So the first non-zero is 8 (position0), the last non-zero is 2 (position13). All 0s between 0 and13 are replaced with 3. But in the row, there are 0s and other non-zeros (like the 8s in positions6-8). So maybe the rule is to replace any 0 that is between the first and last non-zero elements in the row, regardless of other non-zeros in between.\n\nFor example, in row2 of test input: first non-zero is 8 at 0, last non-zero is 2 at13. So all 0s between 0 and13 are replaced. But there are other 8s and 2s in between. So for example, the 0s at positions4-5 (0,0) and positions9-10 (0,0) are between 8s and 8s, but according to the rule, they should be replaced. So the output row would be [8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,8,2,2]. But according to Example1's first row, which starts with 8 and ends with 8, but has 0s and 2s in between, the output has 3s in certain positions. So maybe this rule isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more about the first and last occurrence of a non-zero (8 or 2) in the row. Then replace all 0s between them with 3s. So even if there are other non-zeros in between, the 0s between the first and last are replaced.\n\nFor example, in test input row2:\n\nFirst non-zero is 8 at0. Last non-zero is 2 at13. So all 0s between 0 and13, including those in between, are replaced with 3s. So positions4-5 (0,0) become 3,3; positions9-10 (0,0) become 3,3. So the output row would be [8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,8,2,2]. But in the training examples, when there are non-zeros in between, like Example0's first row, only some 0s are replaced. So this might not hold.\n\nBut I'm running out of time and need to make a decision. Based on the training examples, it seems that whenever a row starts and ends with non-zero (8 or 2), all the 0s in between are replaced with 3s. Additionally, in rows where the non-zeros are in the middle, perhaps certain segments are replaced. \n\nGiven that, for the test input:\n\nRow3: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] starts with 8 and ends with 2. All 0s in between are replaced with 3s.\n\nRow4: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2] starts with 8 and ends with 2. All 0s between first 8 and last 2 are replaced with 3s.\n\nRow5: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2] starts with 8 and ends with 2. All 0s between are replaced with 3s.\n\nRow7: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] starts with 8 and ends with 2. All 0s replaced.\n\nRow8: same as row7.\n\nRow9: same as row7.\n\nRow10: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] all 0s between 8 and 2 become 3.\n\nRow11: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2] 0s replaced between 8 and 2.\n\nOther rows:\n\nRow2: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] starts with 8 and ends with 2. All 0s between replaced.\n\nRow1: [8,8,8,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,2,2] starts with 8 and ends with 2. The 0s between 8 and 8 (positions4-5) and between 8 and 2 (positions9-10, 11 is 8, and 12-13 are 2s). So the 0s in positions4-5 and 9-10 are between non-zeros. For example, between position3 (8) and position6 (8), there are 0s at 4-5. So these would be replaced with 3s. Similarly, between position8 (8) and position11 (8), 0s at9-10. So replaced with 3s. So the output row would be [8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,8,2,2].\n\nRow6: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] replaced with 3s between 8 and 2.\n\nRow12: [8,8,0,2,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,2] starts with 8 and ends with 2. The 0s between 8 and the next non-zero. The first non-zero after 8 is at position3 (2). The 0s between 0 and3 are positions1-2. So replaced with 3s? But in Example0's first row, only the last 0 in such a segment is replaced. But in this row, after 8, there's 8 again at position0, but row12 starts with 8. Wait, row12 is [8,8,0,2,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]. The first non-zero is 8 at0, the next non-zero is 8 at1. Then 0 at2, then 2 at3. So the 0 at2 is between 8 (position1) and 2 (position3). So replaced with 3. Then after that, 0s between 2 and 2 (position4). So perhaps the 0 at4 is between 2 and 2, replaced with 3. But this is getting too case-specific.\n\nGiven the time I'm taking and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the rule that in each row, any 0s between the first and last non-zero elements (8 or 2) are replaced with 3s. So for the test input, wherever a row starts and ends with non-zero (8 or 2), replace all 0s in between with 3. For rows that don't start and end with non-zero, only replace certain segments. \n\nApplying this rule to the test input:\n\nRow0: all 8s. No change.\n\nRow1: starts with 8 and ends with 2. The 0s between them are positions4-5 and 9-10. Replace them with 3. So output row1: [8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,8,2,2]\n\nRow2: starts with 8 and ends with 2. All 0s between are replaced. So row2 becomes [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\nRow3: starts with 8 and ends with 2. All 0s replaced: [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\nRow4: starts with 8 and ends with 2. 0s between replaced: [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2]\n\nRow5: starts with 8 and ends with 2. 0s replaced: [8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2]\n\nRow6: starts with 8 and ends with 2. 0s replaced: [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\nRow7: starts with 8 and ends with 2. 0s replaced: [8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\nRow8: same as row7.\n\nRow9: same as row7.\n\nRow10: starts with 8 and ends with 2. 0s replaced: [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\nRow11: starts with 8 and ends with 2. 0s replaced: [8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2]\n\nRow12: starts with 8 and ends with 2. The first non-zero after 8 is 8 at1. Then 0 at2, then 2 at3. So the 0s between 8 (position1) and 2 (position3) are position2. Replace with 3. Then there's a 0 at4 between 2 (position3) and 2 (position5). Replace with3. Then 0s between 2s and 2s. So positions7-10 are 0s between 2 (position6) and 2 (position11). Replace with3s. So row12 becomes [8,8,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,2,2]\n\nRow13: all 2s. No change.\n\nPutting this all together, the final output would look like:\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,8,2,2]\n\n[8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\n[8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\n[8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2]\n\n[8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2]\n\n[8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\n[8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\n[8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\n[8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\n[8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2]\n\n[8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2]\n\n[8,8,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,2,2]\n\n[8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nThis matches the pattern observed in the training examples where rows starting and ending with non-zeros have their 0s replaced with 3s. However, I'm not entirely sure about row12's processing, but given the time constraints, this is the best I can do.",
