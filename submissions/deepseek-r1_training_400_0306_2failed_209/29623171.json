        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of lists (rows) of numbers, and the output modifies some of these numbers. Let's compare the input and output for each example to see what's changing.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some 1s and 0s, and the output replaces certain 1s with 0s except in the last three rows where 1s are turned into multiple 1s. Specifically, the last three rows in the output have [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,1,1,1]. Looking at the input for those rows, the original rows had a 1 in position 8 or 9 or 10. So maybe any row that has a non-zero value (other than 5) in positions beyond the 7th index gets those values replaced with the same number repeated in the last three positions. Wait, in example 0's output, the last three rows have 1s in positions 8,9,10. The input for those rows had 1s in various positions, but the output sets all three of those to 1. Similarly, in Example 1, the output has 2s in the last three positions of the first few rows, and then 2s at the start of some rows. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that for each row, any non-zero and non-5 number in the row is collected, and then those numbers are used to replace certain parts of the row. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. The input rows (excluding the 5-filled rows) have some 1s. For instance, the second input row is [1,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,1,0]. The output for that row is all zeros except the 5s and the last three elements. Wait, no. Wait the output rows for the first part of Example 0 have all zeros except the 5s, except in the last three rows where they have 1s in positions 8,9,10. Oh wait, the last three rows of the output in Example 0 have the 1s in the last three positions, but looking at the input's last three rows:\n\nOriginal input for Example 0:\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,1,0,0] \u2192 Output: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,1,1,1]\nRow 9: [0,1,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,1] \u2192 Output: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,1,1,1]\nRow 10: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 Output: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,1,1,1]\n\nWait, no. Wait the output for rows 8,9,10 in the first example all end with three 1s. But in the input, row 8 has a 1 in position 8 (0-based index 8?), row 9 has 1 in position 1 and 10, and row 10 has all zeros. So the output for these rows replaces the last three elements (positions 8,9,10) with 1s. But where does the 1 come from? Maybe the maximum non-5 number in the row? Let's check.\n\nIn row 8 input, the non-5 numbers are 0s except for a 1 at position 8. The output uses 1. In row 9 input, the non-5 numbers are 1 at position 1 and 10. But the output uses 1 again. So maybe the maximum number in the row (excluding 5s) is taken, and that value is used to fill the last three positions. But in row 8, the max is 1. Row 9's max is 1. Row 10 has 0, so maybe it's 0, but the output has 1. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum non-5 number in the entire input (excluding the 5s) is taken. In example 0, the inputs have 1s. The output's last three rows have 1s. In example 1, the inputs have 2s, and the output's first three rows have 2s in the last three positions, and the next three rows have 2s in the first three positions. In example 2, the inputs have 3s, and the last three rows have 3s in positions 8-10.\n\nWait, looking at example 1's output:\n\nThe first three rows of output have [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,2,2,2]. The original input for row 0 is [0,0,0,5,0,2,0,5,2,0,0]. The non-5 numbers here are 2, 2. So the output's last three positions are filled with 2. Similarly, the next three rows in the output have [2,2,2,5,...], which are the first three positions filled with 2. The input for row 4 was [2,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0], which has a 2 in the first position. So perhaps the maximum non-5 number in the row is used to fill certain positions. Then, in rows where that maximum is present, the fill is done either in the first three positions or the last three.\n\nWait, but how to determine which part of the row is filled.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output: the first several rows (0-2, 4-6) all have 0s except the 5s. Then rows 8-10 have 1s in the last three positions. The original input for these rows had 1s in various positions, perhaps indicating which part to fill.\n\nWait maybe the rows are divided into groups. The grid has 11 rows. Looking at example 0's input and output:\n\nOriginal input has 11 rows. Output's rows 8-10 (indexes 8,9,10) have the 1s. Similarly, in example 1, the first three rows (0-2) in output have 2s in the last three positions. Then rows 4-6 (indexes 4,5,6) have 2s in the first three positions. Then rows 8-10 in example 1's output are all 0s. Hmm, perhaps the rows are grouped into three sets. Wait example 0's output:\n\nRows 0-2: last three positions maybe? No, in example 0, the first three output rows are all zeros except 5s. Wait no. Let me recheck.\n\nWait in example 0's output:\n\nThe output for row 0: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] which is the same as the input's first row. Wait no. Wait example 0's input first row is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] and the output is the same. So for some rows, the output is the same as the input. But other rows are modified.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nINPUT Rows:\n\nRow 0: all zeros except 5s \u2192 output same.\n\nRow 1: has 1s in position 0 and 9 \u2192 output becomes all zeros except 5s and the last three positions are 0. Wait no. The output row 1 is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0], same as row 0. So the 1s in input row 1 are removed.\n\nBut in rows 8,9,10 of the input:\n\nRow 8 input: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,1,0,0] \u2192 output becomes [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,1,1,1]\n\nRow 9 input: [0,1,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,1] \u2192 output becomes [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,1,1,1]\n\nRow 10 input: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 output becomes [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,1,1,1]\n\nSo for rows 8-10 in the output, the last three elements are set to 1. But the input row 10 has no 1s, yet the output has 1s. That's confusing. How does that happen?\n\nWait maybe the 1s are coming from another part. Looking at the entire input, perhaps there's a pattern based on the position of the non-zero, non-5 elements. Let's check the positions where non-5 numbers are present.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRows 0: all 0 except 5s.\n\nRow 1: 1 at position 0 and 9.\n\nRow 2: 1 at position 6.\n\nRow 3: all 5s.\n\nRow 4: 1 at position 6.\n\nRow5: 1 at position 9.\n\nRow6: all 0 except 5s.\n\nRow7: all 5s.\n\nRow8: 1 at position8.\n\nRow9: 1 at position1 and 10.\n\nRow10: all 0 except5s.\n\nThe output for rows 8-10 have the last three elements set to 1. So maybe the maximum value in the entire input (excluding 5s) is 1, and rows 8-10 are replaced with that value in the last three elements. But why those rows?\n\nLooking at the other examples:\n\nIn Example 1, the maximum non-5 number is 2. The first three rows of the output have 2s in the last three positions. Rows 4-6 have 2s in the first three positions. And rows 8-10 are 0s. Wait, but how are these groupings determined?\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nOutput rows 0-2: last three positions are 2.\n\nOutput rows 4-6: first three positions are 2.\n\nOutput rows 8-10: unchanged (all 0s except 5s).\n\nBut the input for rows 0-2 in Example1 has some 2s. Row0 has 2 at positions 5 and8. Row1 has 2 at 0 and 10. Row2 has no 2s. So perhaps the presence of a 2 in any of the positions in the row causes that group of rows to be modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are divided into three groups: top, middle, bottom. Like, rows 0-2 (top group), rows 4-6 (middle group), and rows 8-10 (bottom group). The rows with 5s (rows 3 and7) are separators. Then, in each group, the maximum non-5 value in the entire group is taken, and that value is filled in certain positions of each row in the group.\n\nFor example, in example0:\n\nGroup1 (rows0-2): the maximum non-5 is 1 (from rows1 and2). So in group1's output rows, maybe certain positions are filled with 1. But in example0's output, rows0-2 are all zeros except 5s. So that idea might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in each group of three rows, the maximum non-5 value in that group is taken, and then the rows in the group are modified to set certain positions to that maximum.\n\nLooking at example0's groups:\n\nGroup1: rows0-2. The non-5 values include 1s. So the max is 1. Then, perhaps in these rows, the last three positions are set to 1. But in the output, the first three rows are all zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each group of three rows (excluding the 5 rows) is processed. For example, in example0, after the first 5-row (row3), the next group is rows4-6, and the next group after row7 is rows8-10.\n\nWait, the input is:\n\nRows:\n\n0,1,2: group1.\n\nRow3: all5s.\n\n4,5,6: group2.\n\nRow7: all5s.\n\n8,9,10: group3.\n\nIn example0's output:\n\nGroup1 (rows0-2) output: all zeros except 5s. Original group1 had 1s in rows1 and2. But output is zeros. So that's not the case.\n\nGroup2 (rows4-6) in example0 input: rows4 has 1 at position6, row5 has1 at position9, row6 is zeros. Output for group2 is all zeros except 5s.\n\nGroup3 (rows8-10) input has 1s in row8 and9. Output for group3 is last three positions set to1.\n\nSo, in group3, the max non-5 value is 1. The output for each row in group3 sets the last three elements to 1.\n\nSimilarly, in example1:\n\nGroup1 (rows0-2) input has 2s in row0 (positions5,8), row1 (positions0,10), and row2 has no 2s. The max is 2. The output for group1's rows (0-2) sets the last three elements to2.\n\nGroup2 (rows4-6) input has row4 with a 2 in position0, row5 has a 2 in position6, row6 has 2 in position9. Output for group2's rows (4-6) sets the first three elements to2.\n\nGroup3 (rows8-10) input has row8 (all zeros), row9 (2s at positions0,6,10), row10 (all zeros). Max is 2, but the output for group3's rows (8-10) is all zeros. Hmm, that contradicts the previous pattern.\n\nWait example1's output for group3 (rows8-10) is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] for each row. So why isn't the max 2 used here? Because in group3 of example1's input, the rows8-10 have some 2s. Row9 in the input has 2s in positions0,6,10. So the max is 2. But the output for group3 in example1's output has zeros. So that pattern isn't consistent.\n\nHmm, maybe the group is determined by the position of the maximum value in the row. Like, if the maximum value is in the first half of the row, then fill the first three positions, or if it's in the second half, fill the last three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each group of three rows, the maximum value in that group determines the number to fill, and the direction (left or right) is determined by which part of the group the max appears in.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows are divided into three groups (top, middle, bottom), and each group's non-5 maximum is determined. Then, for each row in the group, the first three or last three positions are filled with that maximum. Which part to fill depends on the group's position. For example, top group fills last three, middle group fills first three, bottom group fills last three.\n\nIn example0:\n\nTop group (rows0-2): max is1. So fill last three positions. But in the output, rows0-2 are filled with zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait no. The output for example0's rows0-2 are all zeros. So maybe the top group isn't filled. But in example1, the top group (rows0-2) have their last three filled with 2. Middle group (rows4-6) have their first three filled with2. Bottom group (rows8-10) are zeros. So perhaps the direction is determined by the group's position: top group fills last three, middle fills first three, bottom fills last three again. But in example0, the bottom group (rows8-10) fill last three with1. In example1's bottom group, rows8-10 are all zeros, but their input has a max of2. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction depends on the group's position. Top group fills last three, middle group fills first three, bottom group fills last three. But in example1's bottom group, the output doesn't fill anything. So maybe this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is determined by the presence of non-zero values in certain positions. For example, if the maximum in the group is found in the first three positions of any row in the group, then fill the first three positions. If found in the last three, fill the last three. But how?\n\nLooking at example1's group1 (rows0-2):\n\nThe max is2. In row0 of the input, the 2s are at positions5 and8 (which are positions 5 and 8 in the 0-based index, which are after the first three positions). So maybe the group's direction is determined by where the max first appears. If the max is first found in the first half of the row, fill first three; else fill last three.\n\nIn example1's group1, the max 2 appears in positions5 and8. So perhaps the group's direction is to fill last three. Which matches the output. Then, group2 (rows4-6) in example1: the max is2. In row4, the 2 is at position0 (first position), so fill first three. In group3 (rows8-10), the max is2 (in row9's position0,6,10). But the output doesn't fill. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nIn example0's output, the only rows that are modified (other than the 5-rows) are the last three rows (8-10), where the last three elements are set to1.\n\nIn example1's output, the first three rows (0-2) have last three elements as2. The next three rows (4-6) have first three elements as2. The last three rows (8-10) are unchanged.\n\nIn example2's output, the last three rows (8-10) have the last three elements as3.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each group of three rows (excluding the 5-rows), check if there is a non-zero, non-5 number. If yes, then in that group's rows, replace either the first three or last three elements with that number. The decision of first or last might depend on the group's position. For example, top group fills last three, middle group fills first three, bottom group fills last three.\n\nBut in example1, the middle group (rows4-6) is filled with 2 in first three positions. In example0, the bottom group (rows8-10) is filled with1 in last three. In example2, the bottom group is filled with3 in last three.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\nGroups are separated by the 5-rows. Each group (before and after 5-rows) has three rows. For each group, if there's a non-zero number (excluding5), take the maximum such number, and replace the first three or last three elements of each row in the group with that number. The direction (first or last) depends on the group's position. For example:\n\n- The first group (top) after the first 5-row: fill last three.\n\n- The middle group (after second 5-row): fill first three.\n\n- The bottom group (after third 5-row? But there's only two 5-rows in examples. Wait in example0, the 5-rows are at positions3 and7. So the groups are:\n\nRows0-2 (before first 5-row?), then rows4-6 (after first 5-row), then rows8-10 (after second 5-row).\n\nWait no. The structure is:\n\nRow3 is all5s. Then rows4-6 come after that. Row7 is all5s. Then rows8-10.\n\nSo groups are:\n\nGroup1: rows0-2.\n\nGroup2: rows4-6.\n\nGroup3: rows8-10.\n\nFor each group, check if there's a non-5 number. The direction to fill depends on the group. Group1 (top) fills last three positions. Group2 (middle) fills first three. Group3 (bottom) fills last three.\n\nIn example0:\n\nGroup1 has non-5 numbers (1s). Max is1. So fill last three. But in the output, group1's rows are all zeros. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nWait example0's group1 has rows0-2. In input, rows0 has 0s, row1 has 1s, row2 has a 1. The output for group1's rows0-2 are all zeros except the 5s. So that's not matching. So maybe my group division is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe groups are separated by the 5-rows. So between two 5-rows is a group. Let's see:\n\nIn example0, there are two 5-rows: row3 and row7. So the first group is rows0-2 (before row3), then rows4-6 (between row3 and row7), then rows8-10 (after row7).\n\nIn example0's output:\n\nGroup1 (0-2): output rows are zeros except 5s. So no change.\n\nGroup2 (4-6): output rows are zeros except 5s.\n\nGroup3 (8-10): output rows have last three positions as1.\n\nBut in group3's input, there are 1s. So group3's max is1. So the output for group3's rows fills last three positions with1.\n\nIn example1's groups:\n\nGroup1 (0-2): input has 2s. Max is2. Output fills last three positions of each row in group1 with2.\n\nGroup2 (4-6): input has 2s. Max is2. Output fills first three positions of each row in group2 with2.\n\nGroup3 (8-10): input has 2s. But output rows are zeros. So this contradicts.\n\nWait no, in example1's group3 input:\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 no 2s.\n\nRow9: [2,0,0,5,0,0,2,5,0,0,2] \u2192 has 2s at positions0,6,10.\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 no 2s.\n\nSo the max in group3 is2. But the output for group3 is zeros. So this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction alternates. First group fills last three, next fills first three, next fills last three again. But in example1, group3 would then fill last three, but in the output, group3's rows are unchanged.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is determined by the group's position. First group (top) \u2192 last three. Second group (middle) \u2192 first three. Third group (bottom) \u2192 last three. But in example1's group3 (bottom) the output doesn't follow. So maybe some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is determined by where the maximum value appears in the group. For example, if the maximum in the group appears in the first three columns, then fill first three. If it appears in the last three columns, fill last three.\n\nLooking at example0's group3 (rows8-10):\n\nInput rows8-10:\n\nRow8: 1 at position8 (which is the 9th element, 0-based index 8). So position8 is in the last three (positions8,9,10). So fill last three.\n\nExample1's group1 (rows0-2):\n\nRow0 has 2 at positions5 and8. Position5 is in the middle, 8 is last three. So fill last three.\n\nGroup2 (rows4-6):\n\nRow4 has 2 at position0 (first three). So fill first three.\n\nGroup3 (rows8-10):\n\nRow9 has 2 at positions0,6,10. Position0 is first three, 6 is middle, 10 is last three. So the maximum appears in multiple areas. How to decide?\n\nHmm, maybe if the maximum appears in any of the first three positions, then fill first three; else, fill last three.\n\nIn example1's group3:\n\nRow9 has a 2 in position0 (first three). So fill first three. But the output for group3's rows are zeros. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is determined by the first occurrence of the maximum in the group. If the first occurrence is in the first three positions, fill first three. Else, fill last three.\n\nIn example0's group3: the first occurrence of 1 is in position8 (last three), so fill last three.\n\nIn example1's group1: first occurrence of 2 is in row0's position5 (not first three). So fill last three.\n\nGroup2 in example1: first occurrence of 2 is row4's position0 (first three), so fill first three.\n\nGroup3 in example1: first occurrence of 2 is row9's position0 (first three), so fill first three. But the output doesn't do that. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction is determined by the group's position. Top group (group1) fills last three, middle group (group2) fills first three, bottom group (group3) fills last three.\n\nBut in example1's group3, the output rows are zeros. So that's not matching.\n\nWait example1's group3 has a max of2. According to this rule, since it's the bottom group, it should fill last three. But the output doesn't. So this can't be right.\n\nHmm. Maybe the number of groups with non-zero max determines where they are filled. For example, in example0, there's only group3 with non-zero max. So filled. In example1, group1 and group2 have non-zero max, so filled. Group3 has max2, but not filled. So perhaps there's a condition where only certain groups are filled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if a group has the same max as the previous groups, it is not filled. But example0's group3 has max1, example1's groups1 and 2 have max2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace all non-5 elements with zeros, except in certain rows where the maximum value in the entire input (excluding5) is used to fill certain positions.\n\nLooking at example0, the entire input's max non-5 is1. So any row that has a 1 is modified. For example, rows8-10 have 1s in the input, and in the output, their last three positions are filled with1.\n\nIn example1, the entire input's max is2. Rows0-2 have 2s, and their last three are filled with2. Rows4-6 have2s and their first three are filled with2. Rows8-10 have 2s but are not filled. So this doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are processed such that for each row, if there is a non-zero value (excluding5), then the leftmost or rightmost three positions are filled with the maximum value in that row. The direction (left or right) depends on the row's position.\n\nFor example, in example0's row8: the max is1. The row is part of the bottom group, so fill last three. Row9: max1, fill last three. Row10: max0, but in output it's filled with1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, the maximum non-5 value in the row is taken, and if it's non-zero, the entire row is replaced with zeros except 5s and the first or last three positions filled with that max. The direction depends on the row's position in the group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction is determined by the row's index modulo something. For example, even rows fill left, odd rows fill right. But looking at the examples, it's not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, in example0's output, the modified rows are the last three (8-10). In example1, the modified rows are the first three (0-2) and middle three (4-6). In example2, the modified rows are the last three (8-10). The test input has 11 rows, with 5-rows at positions3 and7.\n\nSo the pattern could be: for each group of three rows (0-2,4-6,8-10), if there's a non-zero value in that group, then the group's rows are modified. For each group, if the group has a non-zero value, then fill either the first three or last three positions of each row in the group with the maximum value in that group. The direction is determined by the group's position: first group (0-2) fills last three, second group (4-6) fills first three, third group (8-10) fills last three.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nExample0:\n\nGroup1 (0-2): max is1. Fill last three. So each row in group1 should have last three elements as1. But the output for group1's rows are all zeros. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. Wait, in example0's group1 input:\n\nRow0: all zeros except5.\n\nRow1: 1s at positions0 and9.\n\nRow2:1 at position6.\n\nMax in group1 is1. So according to the hypothesis, each row in group1's output should have last three positions as1. But the output for these rows in example0 are zeros. So that's not matching.\n\nBut in example0's output, group3 (rows8-10) has last three positions filled with1.\n\nExample1's group1 (0-2): max is2. Fill last three. The output does fill last three with2.\n\nGroup2 (4-6): max is2. Fill first three. Output for these rows have first three as2.\n\nGroup3 (8-10): max is2. Fill last three. But the output doesn't. So this contradicts.\n\nExample2's group3 (8-10): max is3. Fill last three. Output for these rows has last three as3.\n\nSo why does example1's group3 not follow the pattern?\n\nLooking back at example1's group3:\n\nInput rows8-10:\n\nRow8: all zeros except5.\n\nRow9: 2s at0,6,10.\n\nRow10: all zeros except5.\n\nMax is2. According to the hypothesis, should fill last three with2. But the output for these rows is all zeros.\n\nSo this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAlternative approach: look for the specific changes in each example.\n\nIn example0, the input rows 8-10 have some 1s. The output for these rows changes the last three elements to1. The rest of the rows with 1s are modified to have zeros except for 5s.\n\nIn example1, the input has 2s in various places. For group1 (rows0-2), the output sets last three to2. For group2 (rows4-6), the output sets first three to2. For group3 (rows8-10), the input has a row9 with 2s, but the output doesn't change them.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the pattern is that for each group, if the group contains a non-zero number, then the maximum non-zero number in the group is used to fill either the first three or last three positions of all rows in the group, depending on whether the majority of the non-zero elements in the group are in the first or last part.\n\nFor example, in example0's group3:\n\nThe non-zero elements are in positions8 and10 (last three positions). So fill last three.\n\nIn example1's group1:\n\nNon-zero elements are in positions5,8,0,10 (so some in first, some in last). But the majority are in last three? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the group is filled based on where the first occurrence of the maximum appears.\n\nIn example0's group3: first 1 appears in position8 (last three), so fill last three.\n\nIn example1's group1: first 2 appears in position5 (middle), but example1's group1 fills last three. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the first non-zero element in the group determines the direction.\n\nIn example1's group1: first non-zero is row0's position5 (middle), but output fills last three. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's try to find another angle.\n\nLooking at the outputs, for each modified row, either the first three or last three elements are set to the maximum non-5 value of that group. The rest are zeros and 5s.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn example0's group3, the output is three rows with last three 1s.\n\nIn example1's group1, three rows with last three 2s.\n\nIn example1's group2, three rows with first three 2s.\n\nIn example2's group3, three rows with last three 3s.\n\nThe test input has a group1 (rows0-2), group2 (4-6), group3 (8-10). Let's see what the maximum non-5 values are in each group.\n\nTest input:\n\nGroup0-2:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 non-5 values:4,4,0...\n\nRow1: [0,4,0,5,0,0,4,5,4,4,0] \u2192 non-5:4,4,4,4.\n\nRow2: [4,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,4,0] \u2192 non-5:4,4.\n\nMax in group0-2 is4.\n\nGroup4-6:\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,4,0] \u2192 non-5:4.\n\nRow5: [4,0,0,5,0,4,0,5,4,0,4] \u2192 non-5:4,4,4,4.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 all zeros except5.\n\nMax is4.\n\nGroup8-10:\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,5,0,4,0,5,0,0,4] \u2192 non-5:4,4.\n\nRow9: [4,0,0,5,0,0,4,5,0,4,0] \u2192 non-5:4,4,4.\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,5,4,4,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 non-5:4,4.\n\nMax is4.\n\nAccording to the previous pattern, each group's max is4, so each group's rows should be filled with4 in either first or last three positions. The direction depends on the group.\n\nBased on previous examples:\n\nGroup1 (0-2) \u2192 fill last three.\n\nGroup2 (4-6) \u2192 fill first three.\n\nGroup3 (8-10) \u2192 fill last three.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nGroup0-2's output rows should have last three positions as4.\n\nGroup4-6's output should have first three positions as4.\n\nGroup8-10's output should have last three positions as4.\n\nLet's see what that would look like.\n\nOriginal test input rows:\n\nGroup0-2:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 output would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4].\n\nRow1: [0,4,0,5,0,0,4,5,4,4,0] \u2192 output becomes [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4].\n\nRow2: [4,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,4,0] \u2192 output becomes [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4].\n\nGroup4-6:\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,4,0] \u2192 output becomes [4,4,4,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0].\n\nRow5: [4,0,0,5,0,4,0,5,4,0,4] \u2192 output becomes [4,4,4,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0].\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 output becomes [4,4,4,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0].\n\nGroup8-10:\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,5,0,4,0,5,0,0,4] \u2192 output becomes [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4].\n\nRow9: [4,0,0,5,0,0,4,5,0,4,0] \u2192 output becomes [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4].\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,5,4,4,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 output becomes [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4].\n\nThe 5-rows (row3,7) remain unchanged.\n\nThis would match the pattern seen in the examples, where the first group fills last three, middle fills first three, bottom fills last three. The 4s would replace the respective positions.\n\nNow, looking at the test input's group0-2:\n\nOriginal rows have 4s in various positions, but the output for these rows would have zeros except for 5s and last three as4.\n\nGroup4-6's rows would have first three as4, and the rest except 5s as zero.\n\nGroup8-10's rows would have last three as4.\n\nThis matches the pattern observed in the examples. So the final output for the test input should follow this structure.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Looking at the training examples, the input and output matrices. Let's see what's changing.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has some 1s and the output has those 1s turned into 0s except in the last three rows where the 1s are turned into three 1s. Like in the input, row 8 (0-based?) has a 1 at position 8, and in the output, the last three elements of that row are 1s. Similarly, rows 9 and 10 in the input have 1s, and the output rows 8-10 end with three 1s.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the first row is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0], which is the same in the output. But rows with 1s in the input (like row 1) become all zeros except the 5s. Then in the output, the bottom three rows (rows 8,9,10) have their last three elements set to 1. So maybe the pattern is that wherever there's a number (like 1, 2, 3) other than 5, they are aggregated into the last three positions of certain rows. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input, there are 2s. In the output, some rows have 2s in the last three positions, and others have 2s in the first three. For example, the first three rows of the output have 2s in the last three elements. Then rows 4-6 have 2s in the first three. The middle row (row 3, index 3) is all 5s. So maybe the rows are grouped in threes, and the numbers are moved to either the start or end based on their position relative to the 5s rows.\n\nIn Example 2, with 3s, the output's last three rows have 3s in the last three positions. The other 3s in the input get removed except when they're in certain positions. So perhaps each block of rows between the 5s rows (which are all 5s) is being processed. For each block, collect all the non-zero numbers (other than 5) and replace the corresponding parts of the block with those numbers in a certain position.\n\nWait, let's think structurally. Each input matrix is divided into sections by the all-5 rows. In Example 0, there's a 5s row at index 3 and 7. So the matrix is split into three parts: rows 0-2, 4-6, 8-10. Similarly, in Example 1, the 5s are at rows 3 and 7. Each section between 5s rows is a group. Then, for each group, collect the numbers (non-5) and replace parts of those rows with the numbers in a specific part of the row.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first group (rows 0-2), the input has a 1 in row 1, position 0, and row 2, position 6. The output for this group has all those turned to 0, except maybe the numbers are summed or moved. Wait, the output for this group is all 0s except the 5s. So perhaps the non-5 numbers in the group are being collected and placed in the last three positions of the last row of the group. Wait, in Example 0's first group (rows 0-2), the output is all zeros except 5s. But in the third group (rows 8-10), the input has 1s in certain positions. The output for those rows has the last three elements as 1. So maybe for each group, all the non-5 numbers in the group are collected and then placed in either the first three or last three positions of the group's rows.\n\nWait, Example 1's first group (rows 0-2 in input) has 2s in row 0 (positions 0 and 8?), row 1 (position 0 and 10), row 2 has none. The output for the first group (rows 0-2) has the last three elements as 2. So maybe all the non-5 numbers in the group are collected, and then those values are placed in the last three columns for that group. But then in the second group (rows 4-6), the input has 2s in row 4 (position 0), row 5 (positions 0 and 6), row 6 (position 9). The output for rows 4-6 has the first three elements as 2. So maybe depending on the group's position (above or below the middle 5s row?), the numbers are placed in the first three or last three columns.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the third group (rows 8-10) has the numbers in the last three columns, while the first group (rows 0-2) has no numbers. Wait, but in Example 0's group 3 (rows 8-10), the input has a 1 in row 8 (position 8?), row 9 (positions 1 and 10), row 10 (nothing). The output for group 3 has the last three elements as 1. So all the 1s in that group are replaced into the last three positions of each row in the group. Similarly, in Example 1, group 1 (rows 0-2) had 2s, so the output's group 1 has last three columns as 2. Group 2 (rows 4-6) had 2s, and the output has first three columns as 2. Then group 3 (rows 8-10) has 2s in the input, but in the output, they are in the last three columns? Or maybe it's the opposite. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the groups are divided by the 5s rows. Each group is the set of rows between two 5s rows. So, for Example 0:\n\nRows 0-2: group before the first 5s row (row 3)\nRows 4-6: group between first and second 5s rows (row 3 and 7)\nRows 8-10: group after the second 5s row (row 7)\n\nWait, but in Example 0's input, the 5s rows are at index 3 and 7. So the groups would be:\n\nGroup 1: 0-2\nGroup 2:4-6 (since row 3 is 5s)\nGroup3:8-10\n\nIn the output of Example 0, group 3 (8-10) has the last three elements as 1. The input for group 3 has 1s in certain positions. So maybe for each group, all the non-5 values (like 1,2,3, etc.) in the group are collected, and then in the output, for each row in the group, those values are placed in either the first three or last three columns of each row in the group. The position (first or last) depends on the group's position relative to the 5s rows.\n\nIn Example 0, group 3 (after the second 5s row) has the values placed in the last three columns. In Example 1, group1 (before first 5s) has values in last three, group2 (between 5s) has values in first three. Wait, in Example1's output:\n\nGroup1 (rows 0-2) has last three as 2.\n\nGroup2 (rows 4-6) has first three as 2.\n\nGroup3 (rows 8-10) has values in the output as 0s except maybe the last group. Wait, in Example1's output, group3 (rows 8-10) are all 0s except the 5s. But the input for group3 had some 2s in row9 (positions 6 and 10?), but in output, they are 0. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that for each group between 5s rows, if the group is above the middle 5s row (like in the first half), then the collected numbers are placed in the last three columns of the group. If the group is below the middle 5s row, then placed in the first three. But how to determine middle.\n\nAlternatively, the direction alternates. For example, group1 (before first 5s) uses last three, group2 (between first and second 5s) uses first three, group3 (after second 5s) uses last three again. But in Example1, group3's output didn't have 2s. Wait, Example1's test input has group3 (rows8-10) in the input as:\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n[2,0,0,5,0,0,2,5,0,0,2]\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nThe output for group3 in Example1 is:\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nBut the input has 2s in row9 (positions 0,6,10). But the output replaces them with 0. So maybe the 2s in group3 are not being placed. Hmm, that's confusing. So perhaps the pattern isn't just about grouping between 5s rows. Maybe there's something else.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the 5s in each row. The 5s are in the 3rd and 7th positions (index 3 and 7) in each row. So each row is split into parts. For example, in a row, positions 3 and 7 are 5. So the row looks like: [ ... ,5, ... ,5, ... ]\n\nSo maybe the elements before the first 5 (positions 0-2), between the two 5s (positions4-6), and after the second 5 (positions8-10). Then, any numbers in these segments are moved to a particular segment in their group.\n\nLooking at Example0's input row1: [1,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,1,0]. The 1s are in positions0 and9. The segments are: first segment (0-2) has 1,0,0; between 5s (4-6):0,0,0; after (8-10):0,1,0. In the output, row1 becomes all 0s except the 5s. But in the group3 rows, the 1s are moved to the last three positions (8-10). So perhaps any non-zero number (other than 5) in any segment is collected, and then all such numbers in a group are used to fill a particular segment in each row of the group. The target segment depends on the group's position.\n\nFor example, in Example0's group3 (rows8-10), the input has 1 in position8 (row8), 1 in position9 (row9), etc. The output for group3 has all those rows' last three positions (8-10) filled with 1s. So perhaps for group3, all non-5 numbers in any of the group's segments are collected, and then each row in the group has the target segment (like after the second 5) filled with those numbers. Wait, but how are the numbers aggregated. For example, in Example0 group3, the input has multiple 1s. The output replaces the last three elements (positions8-10) of each row in the group with 1s. So it's like taking the maximum value in the group's non-5 numbers and filling the target segment with that.\n\nWait, in Example0 group3, the numbers are 1s. The output fills the last three positions with 1. In Example1 group1 (rows0-2), the numbers are 2s, so the last three positions of each row in the group are filled with 2. In Example1 group2 (rows4-6), the numbers are 2s, and the output's first three positions are filled with 2. So perhaps the direction (first three or last three) depends on the group's position.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is:\n\nFor each group of rows between the all-5 rows, collect all the non-5 numbers. Then, for each row in the group, replace either the first three elements (positions 0-2) or the last three elements (positions8-10) with the collected number(s). The choice of which segment to replace depends on the group's position. Maybe groups before a certain 5s row use last three, others first three. Or even/odd group indices.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the number of groups. In Example0, there are three groups (before first 5s, between, after). The first group (rows0-2) and third group (rows8-10) have their non-5 numbers placed in the last three positions. The middle group (rows4-6) in Example0's output has all 0s except 5s. Wait, but in Example1, the first group's output has last three 2s, middle group's output has first three 2s, third group has no 2s. Hmm. Maybe it's based on the group's position modulo 2. If the group is the first or third (odd-numbered?), they use last three. The middle (even-numbered?) uses first three.\n\nAlternatively, the first and third groups (the ones that are outside the middle group) have their numbers placed in the last three, while the middle group (between two 5s) has numbers in the first three. Let's check:\n\nExample0: first group (0-2) output all 0s. Wait, no. In example0's first group, the output is all 0s except 5s. The non-5 numbers in the group (like 1s in rows1 and2) are removed, but in group3, the 1s are placed in the last three.\n\nHmm, maybe the groups that are after the first 5s row and before the next 5s row are considered middle groups. For those, non-5 numbers are placed in the first three. For groups before the first 5s row and after the last 5s row, the numbers are placed in the last three.\n\nIn Example0, group1 (before first 5s row) has some 1s in input, but in the output, they are cleared. So that contradicts. Unless the first group (before first 5s) is handled differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for any group (regardless of position), if the group contains a certain number, then that number is placed in either the first three or last three positions of all rows in the group. The direction (first or last) depends on the group's position relative to the 5s rows.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the positions of the non-5 numbers in the input and where they end up in the output.\n\nIn Example0's group3 (rows8-10):\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,1,0,0] \u2192 output [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,1,1,1]\nRow9: [0,1,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,1] \u2192 output [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,1,1,1]\nRow10: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 output [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,1,1,1]\n\nSo the numbers 1s in positions8 and9 and10 in row8 and row9 are replaced into the last three positions. So it's like any occurrence of the number (1 in this case) in the group causes the last three elements of all rows in the group to be filled with that number. But in row10, there was no 1, but the output has 1s. So the 1s from other rows in the group are aggregated, and then the entire group's rows have their last three positions filled with that number.\n\nIn Example1's group1 (rows0-2):\n\nInput has 2s in row0 (positions0,8?), row1 (positions0,10), row2 has none. Output for group1 has the last three positions (8-10) filled with 2. So the presence of 2s in the group leads to the last three of each row in the group being 2.\n\nIn Example1's group2 (rows4-6):\n\nInput has 2s in row4 (position0), row5 (positions0,6), row6 (position9). Output for group2 has first three positions (0-2) filled with 2. So the presence of 2s in the group leads to the first three positions being filled with 2.\n\nIn Example2's group3 (rows8-10):\n\nInput has 3s in various positions. Output's last three positions of each row in the group are filled with 3.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each group (rows between 5s rows), collect all the non-5 numbers. Then, for each row in the group, replace either the first three or the last three elements with the collected number(s). Which part to replace depends on the group's position.\n\nBut how to determine which group uses first or last.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nExample0's group3 uses last three.\n\nExample1's group1 uses last three, group2 uses first three.\n\nExample2's group3 uses last three.\n\nSo maybe groups are processed in order. The first group (after the first 5s row) uses last three, the next group (middle) uses first three, then the next uses last three again. Or maybe even and odd groups.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the position of the group relative to the entire matrix. For example:\n\nIn Example0, group3 is after the second 5s row (row7). The groups are:\n\nGroup0: rows0-2 (before first 5s row at row3)\n\nGroup1: rows4-6 (between first and second 5s rows)\n\nGroup2: rows8-10 (after second 5s row)\n\nBut in Example0, group0's output has no numbers (all zeros except 5s). Group1's output also has zeros. Group2's output has 1s in last three. So perhaps group0 and group2 are treated as 'outer' groups, and group1 as a 'middle' group. But how.\n\nAlternatively, the number of groups depends on the number of 5s rows. Each 5s row splits the matrix into sections.\n\nWait, each example's input has two 5s rows. So the matrix is divided into three sections: before the first 5s, between the two 5s, after the second 5s.\n\nIn Example0, the groups are:\n\n- Before first 5s: rows0-2\n\n- Between: rows4-6\n\n- After: rows8-10\n\nNow, for the first and third groups (before and after), non-5 numbers are placed in the last three positions. For the middle group (between), non-5 numbers are placed in the first three positions.\n\nIn Example0, the first group (before) has non-5 numbers (1s), but in the output, they are removed. Wait, no, in Example0's first group, input has 1 in row1, 0,0,5, etc. But the output for the first group has all zeros except 5s. So perhaps that's not the case. Wait, but why in Example0's first group, the 1s are removed. Hmm, maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the middle group's non-5 numbers are placed in the first three, and the other groups' numbers are placed in the last three. Let's check:\n\nIn Example1:\n\n- Group1 (before first 5s) has non-5 numbers 2s. Output: last three positions of each row in group are 2.\n\n- Group2 (between) has non-5 numbers 2s. Output: first three positions of each row in group are 2.\n\n- Group3 (after second 5s) has non-5 numbers 2s in input (row9), but output has zeros. Wait, no. In Example1's group3 input:\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [2,0,0,5,0,0,2,5,0,0,2]\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nThe non-5 numbers are 2s in row9 (positions0,6,10). The output for group3 is all zeros except 5s. So perhaps this group doesn't have any non-5 numbers. Wait, but there are 2s. Why are they not being placed in the last three?\n\nThis contradicts the earlier assumption. So maybe there's another factor. Perhaps the numbers in the middle group (between the 5s rows) are placed in the first three positions, and numbers in the other groups are placed in the last three. But in Example1's group3, which is after the second 5s row, why are the 2s not placed in the last three?\n\nWait, in Example1's output, group3 (rows8-10) are all zeros except 5s. But the input has 2s in row9. So maybe the numbers are only processed if they appear in certain segments of the input rows.\n\nLooking back at the structure of each row. Each row has 5s at positions3 and7. So the row is split into three segments:\n\n- Left segment: positions0-2\n\n- Middle segment: positions4-6\n\n- Right segment: positions8-10\n\nSo each row has three segments. Now, perhaps the non-5 numbers in a group are collected from all segments of all rows in the group, and then for each row in the group, the left segment is filled with the numbers if it's a middle group, or the right segment if it's a before/after group.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn Example1's group1 (before first 5s):\n\nInput rows have 2s in left segment (row0, position0) and right segment (row0, position8; row1, position10). The output for group1 has the right segment filled with 2s. So the non-5 numbers from all segments in the group are collected, and the right segment is filled.\n\nIn group2 (between 5s), the input has 2s in left segment (row4,0; row5,0 and6), and right segment (row6,9). The output's group2 has left segment filled with 2s.\n\nIn group3 (after), the input has 2s in left (row9,0), middle (row9,6), right (row9,10). But the output has all zeros. So perhaps the group3 is not processed. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that for each group, if the group is before or after the 5s rows, collect all non-5 numbers in the right segments and fill the right segments of all rows in the group with the maximum number found. For middle groups, collect all non-5 numbers in left and middle segments and fill the left segments with the maximum.\n\nBut in Example1's group3, there are 2s in left, middle, and right segments. But output group3 has zeros. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that in groups before the first 5s row and after the last 5s row, collect all non-5 numbers in the right segments (positions8-10), and fill those segments in each row of the group with the maximum number found. In groups between 5s rows, collect non-5 numbers in left and middle segments (positions0-6), and fill the left segments (positions0-2) with the maximum number.\n\nWait, let's check Example1's group1 (before first 5s row):\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,5,0,2,0,5,2,0,0] \u2192 right segment is [2,0,0] (positions8-10: 2,0,0)\n\nRow1: [2,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,2] \u2192 right segment [0,0,2]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 right segment [0,0,0]\n\nNon-5 numbers in right segments: 2 (row0), 2 (row1). The output's group1 has right segments filled with 2. So this fits.\n\nGroup2 (between 5s rows):\n\nInput rows4-6:\n\nRow4: [2,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 left segment [2,0,0], middle [0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [2,0,0,5,0,0,2,5,0,0,0] \u2192 left [2,0,0], middle [0,0,2]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,2,0] \u2192 left [0,0,0], middle [0,0,0], right [0,2,0]\n\nBut the middle group's non-5 numbers are in left and middle segments. So maximum is 2. The output's group2 has left segments filled with 2.\n\nGroup3 (after 5s rows):\n\nInput rows8-10:\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 right [0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [2,0,0,5,0,0,2,5,0,0,2] \u2192 right [0,0,2]\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 right [0,0,0]\n\nNon-5 numbers in right segments: 2 (row9). So output's group3 should have right segments filled with 2. But the actual output for group3 has all zeros except 5s. This contradicts. So maybe this theory is wrong.\n\nBut wait, looking at Example1's output, group3's rows are all [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. But according to the theory, the right segments should be filled with 2. So why is this not happening?\n\nHmm, this suggests that the pattern is more complex. Let me re-examine Example1's input and output.\n\nIn Example1's input, group3 (rows8-10) has:\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [2,0,0,5,0,0,2,5,0,0,2]\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nThe output for group3 is all zeros except 5s. So in this case, the 2s in row9's left and middle segments (positions0 and6) are not being moved to the right segment. So perhaps the rule is that only the numbers in the right segment of the group are considered for the right segments of the output. Similarly, only numbers in the left and middle segments are considered for the left segments of the output in the middle group.\n\nIn Example1's group3 (after 5s), the right segments of the input rows have:\n\nRow8's right: [0,0,0] (no non-5)\n\nRow9's right: [0,0,2] \u2192 2 is non-5\n\nRow10's right: [0,0,0]\n\nSo there's a 2 in the right segment of row9. So according to the theory, the output's group3 should have all rows' right segments filled with 2. But the actual output for group3 is all zeros. So this contradicts.\n\nThis suggests that the theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: look for the numbers in the input and see how they are transformed in the output.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output's rows have either 5s or 0s in positions3 and7. The other positions (0-2,4-6,8-10) are either 0 or the collected number.\n\nSo the transformation is that for each group between 5s rows, all non-5 numbers in the group are replaced into either the first three or last three positions of each row in the group, and the middle segments (4-6) are set to 0.\n\nWait, in Example0's group3, the input's middle segments (4-6) are zeros, and the output's middle segments are also zeros. But in Example1's group2, the input's middle segments have 2s (row5's position6), but the output's middle segments are zeros. So the middle segments are cleared, and the non-5 numbers are moved to either the first or last three positions.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Split the matrix into groups separated by all-5 rows.\n\n2. For each group, collect all non-5 numbers. \n\n3. For each row in the group:\n\n   a. Replace the first three elements (0-2) or last three (8-10) with the collected number(s).\n\n   b. Set middle segments (4-6) to 0.\n\nBut how to determine which to replace.\n\nLooking at Example0's group3: all non-5 numbers are 1s. The output's group3 has last three elements as 1.\n\nExample1's group1: non-5 numbers are 2s. Output's group1 has last three as 2.\n\nExample1's group2: non-5 numbers are 2s. Output's group2 has first three as 2.\n\nExample2's group3: non-5 numbers are 3s. Output's group3 has last three as 3.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that groups before the first 5s row and after the last 5s row have their non-5 numbers placed in the last three positions. Groups between 5s rows have their non-5 numbers placed in the first three positions.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0:\n\n- Group1 (before first 5s): rows0-2. Input has 1s. But output has all zeros. Wait, this contradicts.\n\nBut wait, in Example0's group1 (rows0-2):\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [1,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,1,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,5,0,0,1,5,0,0,0]\n\nNon-5 numbers: 1s in row1 (positions0 and9), row2 (position6).\n\nBut according to the theory, since this group is before the first 5s row, the non-5 numbers should be placed in the last three. But the output for this group is all zeros. So this suggests that the theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the groups are the ones between the 5s rows. Like the group after the first 5s and before the second. But in Example0, the first group is before the first 5s row, which may not be considered a group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the groups that are between two 5s rows are processed, and the groups before the first or after the last are not. But in Example0, group3 is after the second 5s row and is processed.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output for each group, the non-5 numbers are replaced by a certain value in the same positions across all rows of the group. For example, in Example0's group3, all rows have 1s in positions8-10. In Example1's group1, all rows have 2s in positions8-10. In Example1's group2, all rows have 2s in positions0-2. So the entire group's relevant segment is filled with the same number. This suggests that the number is determined by the maximum or the only non-zero number in the group.\n\nFor example, in Example0 group3, the non-5 numbers are 1s, so output segment is filled with 1.\n\nIn Example1 group1, non-5 numbers are 2s, output segment is 2.\n\nIn Example1 group2, non-5 numbers are 2s, output segment is 2.\n\nIn Example2 group3, non-5 numbers are 3s, output segment is3.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\nFor each group between 5s rows:\n\n- Collect all non-5 numbers in the group.\n\n- If there are any, take the maximum number (or the only number) and fill the corresponding segment (first or last three) of all rows in the group with that number.\n\n- The choice of segment depends on the group's position.\n\nBut how to determine first or last.\n\nLooking at Example0's group3 (after the second 5s row), fill last three.\n\nExample1's group1 (before first 5s row), fill last three.\n\nExample1's group2 (between two 5s), fill first three.\n\nExample2's group3 (after second 5s), fill last three.\n\nSo groups before first 5s and after last 5s fill last three; groups between two 5s fill first three.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Split the input into groups separated by the all-5 rows.\n\n2. For each group:\n\n   a. If the group is before the first all-5 row or after the last all-5 row:\n\n      i. Collect all non-5 numbers in the group.\n\n      ii. If there are any, replace the last three elements (positions8-10) of each row in the group with the maximum number found.\n\n   b. If the group is between two all-5 rows:\n\n      i. Collect all non-5 numbers in the group.\n\n      ii. Replace the first three elements (positions0-2) of each row in the group with the maximum number found.\n\n3. Any numbers in the middle segments (positions4-6) are set to 0.\n\nBut wait, in Example0's group1 (before first 5s):\n\nInput rows have 1s. According to the rule, the last three should be filled with 1. But the output for group1 is all zeros. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, but looking at Example0's group1 (rows0-2), the output is:\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nBut according to the rule, the non-5 numbers are 1s, so the last three should be filled with 1. But that's not the case. So this theory is invalid.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the way groups are defined. Maybe the groups are only those between 5s rows. So in Example0, the groups are:\n\nGroup1: rows4-6 (between first and second 5s)\n\nGroup2: rows8-10 (after second 5s)\n\nBut the first group (rows0-2) is before the first 5s row. According to the previous examples, only groups between 5s rows and after are processed. But Example0's group2 (rows8-10) is processed, but group0 is not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe groups before the first 5s row are not processed, and groups between and after are.\n\nBut in Example0, the first group (rows0-2) has non-5 numbers but their output is cleared. So perhaps groups before first 5s row are cleared. But why? Or maybe the first group is considered outside and not processed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the processing depends on the number of 5s rows. Each 5s row is a separator. The groups are the ones between separators. So in Example0, there are two separators (rows3 and7), creating three groups: 0-2 (before first), 4-6 (between), 8-10 (after). Then:\n\n- Groups before first separator: no processing (cleared).\n\n- Groups between separators: replace first three.\n\n- Groups after last separator: replace last three.\n\nSo in Example0:\n\nGroup0 (0-2): cleared.\n\nGroup1 (4-6): cleared.\n\nGroup2 (8-10): replace last three.\n\nBut in Example0's group1 (4-6), the input has 1s. The output for group1 is all zeros. So this fits. Group2 (8-10) is processed, replacing last three with 1.\n\nExample1:\n\nGroup0 (0-2): cleared.\n\nGroup1 (4-6): replace first three with 2.\n\nGroup2 (8-10): replace last three with 2.\n\nBut in Example1's output, group2 (8-10) is cleared, not filled with 2. So this contradicts.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input, which has 4s. The output should be generated based on the pattern from the examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,4,0,5,0,0,4,5,4,4,0]\n\nRow2: [4,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,4,0]\n\nRow3: all 5s\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,4,0]\n\nRow5: [4,0,0,5,0,4,0,5,4,0,4]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: all 5s\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,5,0,4,0,5,0,0,4]\n\nRow9: [4,0,0,5,0,0,4,5,0,4,0]\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,5,4,4,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 5s rows are at indices3 and7. Thus, groups are:\n\nGroup0: rows0-2 (before first 5s)\n\nGroup1: rows4-6 (between 5s)\n\nGroup2: rows8-10 (after second 5s)\n\nAccording to the previous examples, group0 (before first 5s) is cleared (output zeros except 5s), group1 (between) has first three filled with the collected number (4?), group2 (after) has last three filled with 4.\n\nBut let's check the non-5 numbers in each group.\n\nGroup0 (rows0-2):\n\nRow0: 4,4 in positions0 and1.\n\nRow1: 4 in positions1,6,8,9.\n\nRow2:4 in position0 and9.\n\nSo non-5 numbers are 4s in various segments. If group0 is cleared, the output would have zeros. But according to Example1's group0 (rows0-2) which had 2s, the output filled the last three. But in Example0's group0, which had 1s, the output was cleared. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the groups before the first 5s row are processed by filling the last three if they have non-5 numbers. For example, in Example1's group0 (rows0-2) had non-5 numbers, so output's last three filled with 2. But in Example0's group0 had non-5 numbers (1s), but the output was cleared. So this theory isn't correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe the key is that the group must have non-5 numbers in specific segments. For example, in groups before the first 5s row and after the last 5s row, non-5 numbers in the right segments (8-10) are collected. In groups between 5s, non-5 numbers in the left (0-2) and middle (4-6) segments are collected.\n\nIn Example1's group0 (rows0-2):\n\nRow0's right segment has 2 (position8).\n\nRow1's right segment has 2 (position10).\n\nRow2's right segment has 0.\n\nSo collected 2s. Output's group0's right segments are filled with 2.\n\nIn Example0's group0 (rows0-2):\n\nRow0's right segment is all 0.\n\nRow1's right segment has 1 (position9).\n\nRow2's right segment is 0.\n\nSo collected 1. Output's group0's right segments would be filled with 1. But the actual output has zeros. So this contradicts.\n\nThis is very confusing. Perhaps the pattern is that in groups between 5s rows, non-5 numbers in the left and middle segments are replaced in the first three positions. In groups after the last 5s row, non-5 numbers in any segments are replaced in the last three. But how to confirm.\n\nLooking at Example0's group2 (rows8-10):\n\nInput has 1s in various segments. Output's last three positions are 1. So regardless of where the 1s were in the input, the output's last three are filled with 1.\n\nSimilarly, in Example2's group2 (rows8-10):\n\nInput has 3s in various positions. Output's last three are 3.\n\nSo for groups after the last 5s row, any non-5 numbers in the group are collected, and the last three positions of each row in the group are filled with that number.\n\nFor groups between 5s rows, any non-5 numbers in the group are collected, and the first three positions are filled.\n\nFor groups before the first 5s row, perhaps any non-5 numbers are ignored, and the output is zeros. But in Example1's group0 (before first 5s), there are non-5 numbers (2s), and the output's group0 has last three filled with 2.\n\nSo maybe groups before the first 5s row are processed similarly to groups after the last 5s row: non-5 numbers anywhere in the group are collected and placed in the last three positions.\n\nBut why in Example0's group0, which has non-5 numbers (1s), the output's group0 is zeros. This suggests that the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the groups before the first 5s row are processed the same as groups after the last 5s row: collect all non-5 numbers and fill the last three positions. But in Example0's group0, there are 1s, but the output is zeros. So perhaps there's a threshold. For example, the majority number or the maximum.\n\nBut in Example0's group0, the 1s are present in row1 and row2. But the output is zeros. So this doesn't help.\n\nMaybe there's an error in the training examples. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet's try to apply the pattern to the test input.\n\nTest input has 4s. The 5s rows are at index3 and7.\n\nGroups:\n\nGroup0 (rows0-2) before first 5s.\n\nGroup1 (rows4-6) between 5s.\n\nGroup2 (rows8-10) after 5s.\n\nFor group0:\n\nNon-5 numbers are 4s in various positions. According to previous examples, if this group is before the first 5s row, then the last three positions should be filled with 4. Let's see.\n\nIn Example1's group0 (rows0-2), the non-5 numbers were 2s and the output's group0 had last three filled with 2. So according to this, group0's output should have last three as 4.\n\nFor group1 (between 5s):\n\nNon-5 numbers are 4s in various positions (rows4,5,6). According to examples, these should be placed in first three positions.\n\nFor group2 (after 5s):\n\nNon-5 numbers are 4s. These should be placed in last three positions.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nGroup0 (rows0-2):\n\nInput has 4s in various segments. Output should have last three (8-10) filled with4.\n\nSo row0's output: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4]\n\nGroup1 (rows4-6):\n\nCollect 4s. Output first three filled with4.\n\nRow4: [4,4,4,5,0,0,0,5,0,4,0] \u2192 becomes [4,4,4,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [4,4,4,5,0,0,0,5,4,0,4] \u2192 becomes [4,4,4,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [4,4,4,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nGroup2 (rows8-10):\n\nCollect 4s. Output last three filled with4.\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4]\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4]\n\nBut the middle segments (positions4-6) should be set to 0.\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\nFor group0:\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4]\n\nGroup1:\n\n[4,4,4,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[4,4,4,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[4,4,4,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nGroup2:\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4]\n\nThe 5s rows remain unchanged.\n\nPutting it all together, the output should look like this:\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[4,4,4,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[4,4,4,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[4,4,4,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,4]\n\nBut looking at the test input's group1 (rows4-6):\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,4,0] \u2192 in the output, first three are 4s, and positions8-10 are 0s.\n\nRow5: [4,0,0,5,0,4,0,5,4,0,4] \u2192 output first three 4s, middle segments 0s.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 output first three 4s.\n\nSo the first three positions of all rows in group1 are set to 4, and the last three are 0s.\n\nThis seems to fit the pattern observed in the training examples.\n\nThus, the final answer should be structured as above.",
