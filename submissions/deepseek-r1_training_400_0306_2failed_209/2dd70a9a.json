        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 2D array (like a grid) of numbers, and the output seems to be a modified version of the input. The main thing I notice is that in the outputs, some numbers are replaced with 3s. Let's see how that happens.\n\nStarting with Example 0: The input has a few 2s and 3s. In the output, there's a row (row 6) where a bunch of 0s are turned into 3s, forming a horizontal line. Similarly, other rows have some 0s turned into 3s. Maybe there's a connection between the 2s and the 3s.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 in row 6 and 7. The output shows that the 2s are still there, but in row 3, there's a horizontal line of 3s. Also, some cells around the 3s in the input are transformed. Wait, the original input in Example 1 has a 3 in rows 1 and 2. The output in row 3 has a line of 3s. Maybe the 3s are expanding downward?\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has 3s in row 5. The output changes some of those to 3s in a line and spreads them. Also, there's a 2 in row 9. The output for that row has 3s replacing some 2s and other 0s around them. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that any 2s in the input are replaced with 3s in the output, but also, there's some kind of filling happening. Or maybe when there's a 2, the cells below it (or in some direction) are filled with 3s until they hit a non-zero value. Let me check the examples again.\n\nIn Example 0's input, there's a 2 in row 2, column 17 (0-based index maybe). In the output, row 6 has a long horizontal line of 3s. But how does the 2 relate to that? The 2 is in row 2, column 17. The output's row 6 has 3s starting from column 3. Maybe it's not directly below. Alternatively, maybe the 3s are forming a vertical line from the 2s? Or perhaps the 3s are filling areas between 2s and 3s in some way.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input, there are 2s in rows 3 and 4 (columns 17 and 17). In the output, those 2s are still present, but in the next rows (rows 5 and 6), there's a line of 3s. So maybe the 3s are flowing downward from the 2s. Like, the 2s are acting as a source, and the 3s are filling downward until they hit a non-zero cell.\n\nIn Example 1, there's a 2 in row 6 and 7, column 5. The output in row 3 has a horizontal line of 3s. Wait, that might not align. Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of 3s. Let me check the positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s in the output are creating a path from existing 3s or 2s. For instance, in Example 0, the input has a 3 in row 15 and 16 (columns 3). The output's rows 4 and 5 have 3s in column 17. Wait, maybe it's not the same.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as replacing certain cells with 3s based on the presence of 2s. For instance, in Example 0's input, the 2 in row 2 (column 17) leads to the entire row 6 being filled with 3s. But how? The row 6 in the input has all 0s except for the last element being 8. The output changes those 0s to 3s except the last one. So maybe the rule is that whenever there's a 2, you fill all the cells to the left (same row) until a non-zero is found. But in that case, row 2's 2 is in column 17 (assuming 0-based), so in the output, row 6 has 3s from column 3 to 17. That doesn't align. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the direction is vertical. Let's take Example 1: the 2 is in row 6 and 7, column 5. In the output, the 2s remain, but the cells above them (like row 3) have 3s. Wait, in Example 1's output, row 3 (the fourth row) has a horizontal line of 3s from column 1 to 5. The input's row 3 has a 8 in column 6. So maybe when there's a 2, you look upwards and fill 3s in the same column until you hit a non-zero. For example, in Example 1's test input, the 2 is in row 6, column 5. So starting from there, moving up each row in column 5, replacing 0s with 3s until a non-zero is hit. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's input:\n\nRow 6: 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, ... \u2192 Output has 2 in column 5.\n\nIn output row 3, columns 1-5 are 3s. Let's see the input rows between 3 and 6:\n\nRow 3 (input) is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8]. The output for row 3 is [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, ...]. So in column 5 (index 5?), which was 0 in input, now 3. So if the 2 is in row 6, column 5, then moving up from there, rows 5,4,3, etc. in column 5 would be filled with 3 until a non-zero. The input in row 3, column 5 is 0, so it's filled. Row 4, column 5 is 0 \u2192 filled. Row 5, column 5 is 0 \u2192 filled. Then row 6 is the 2. So that might be the case.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 0's test input, the 2 is in row 2 and 3 (columns 17, perhaps). Let's see how the output is filled. For example, in row 4 and 5 of the output, columns 17 are 3. Then row 6 has a full line of 3s. Maybe when there are multiple 2s in adjacent rows, the 3s spread horizontally.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: for each 2 in the input, fill all cells in the same column upwards with 3s until a non-zero cell is encountered. Then, for any 3 in the input, fill all cells to the right in the same row with 3s until a non-zero cell is encountered. Let's test that.\n\nTake Example 1's input:\n\nThe 2 is in row 6 and 7, column 5 (if columns are 0-based). For row 6, column 5: fill upwards (rows 5,4,3, etc.) in column 5 with 3s until a non-zero. The input's row 4 has column 5 as 0, row 3 has column 5 as 0, etc. So in the output, rows 3,4,5 in column 5 are 3s. Then, looking at the 3 in input row 1 (column 1), the output for row 3 fills columns 1-5 with 3s. So maybe after filling upwards from 2s, then for existing 3s, fill to the right.\n\nBut how does Example 0's output get the long horizontal line of 3s in row 6? Let's see. The input has a 2 in row 2, column 17 (assuming 0-based). If we fill upwards from there, that would affect rows above. But in the output, the horizontal line is in row 6. Hmm, maybe the direction is downwards instead.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s act as starting points to fill 3s downwards until a non-zero, and existing 3s fill to the right. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, there's a 2 in row 2, column 17. So fill down from there: rows 3,4,5,6, etc., column 17. Looking at the output, row 2's 2 becomes 2, row 3's column 17 is 2. Then row 4's column 17 becomes 3, row5's column17 is3. Then row6's column3 starts a line of 3s. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the 2s are converted to 3s and then propagate in some direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that all 0s between 3s and 2s are replaced with 3s. But that might be too vague.\n\nWait, looking at the test input provided. Let's see what the test input is and try to apply the pattern once I figure it out.\n\nThe test input has a row (row 7) with [8, 0, 8, 3, 3, 0, ...]. So there are 3s in columns 3 and 4. The output for this row might have those 3s expanded. Also, there's a 2 in row 1, columns 6 and 7. So applying the pattern, perhaps the 2s will lead to 3s filling upwards, and the existing 3s will spread to the right.\n\nPutting this all together, maybe the transformation is:\n\n1. For each '2' in the input, fill all cells upwards (in the same column) with '3's until a non-zero cell is encountered.\n2. For each '3' in the input (or created by step 1), fill all cells to the right (in the same row) with '3's until a non-zero cell is encountered.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput has 2 in rows 6 and 7, column 5 (assuming 0-based). For each 2, fill upwards in column 5. So rows 5,4,3,2,1,0 in column 5 get 3s if they are 0. Let's check the output:\n\nRow 3 in the output has columns 1-5 as 3s. Wait, but the original input's row 3, column 5 is 0. So after filling up from 2, column 5 would have 3s in rows 3,4,5. But in the output, row 3 has 3s from column 1 to 5. So that suggests that after filling up, the 3s spread to the right. But why columns 1-5?\n\nWait, the input's row 1 has a 3 in column 1. So according to step 2, for each 3, fill to the right until non-zero. So row 1, column 1 is 3. Then fill all to the right until a non-zero. The input row 1 is [0,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So starting at column1 (3), fill right until 8 (column2). So columns1 and 2 would become 3s? But in the output, row1 is [0,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], same as input. Hmm, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe existing 3s in the input cause filling to the right. But in example1's input, row1 has a 3 in column1, so in the output, that 3 remains, and columns to the right (column2) is 8, so no change. So that's not the case. Then why in example1's output row3 has 3s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s in column5 are filled upwards, making 3s in column5 of rows3,4,5. Then, for each of those 3s, fill to the right until non-zero. Let's see:\n\nRow3 in input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8]. After filling up from the 2, column5 in row3 is 3. Then, fill to the right until non-zero. The row3 has 0s in columns5,6 is 0 (since original row3, column6 is 0?), wait no. The input row3's column5 is 0, column6 is 0, column7 is 8. So filling to the right from column5 would turn columns5,6 into 3s until column7 (which is 8). So row3's columns5 and 6 become 3s. But the output row3 has columns1-5 as 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach might not be correct. Let me think differently.\n\nLooking at example0's output, the 3s form a horizontal line in row6. The input for row6 is all 0s except for the last element. The output changes those 0s to 3s except where there's an 8. Maybe the 3s are filling the entire row except where there's a non-zero. But how does that relate to the 2s?\n\nWait, in example0's input, row2 and row3 have a 2. The output's row6 is filled with 3s. Maybe the 2s are replaced by 3s and the 3s spread in some way. But the output still has the original 2s in their positions, so that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the test input, in row1 there are two 2s. Let's see how they would be processed. If the rule is to fill upwards from each 2, then in column6 and 7 of row1's 2s, we'd fill upwards (since row1 is the second row, assuming rows are 0-based). Wait, row indices: in the test input, the rows are 0 to 12. The 2s are in row1 (second row), columns6 and7. So filling upwards from there would affect rows above. But the rows above are row0. Let's see the test input's row0: [8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0]. Columns6 and7 are 0. So filling upwards from the 2s in row1, columns6-7 would set row0's columns6-7 to 3? But in the output, maybe those would become 3s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replaced by 3s, and then 3s spread to the left and right. But in example0's output, the 2s are still present. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, in example0's output, the original 2s are still there. For example, row2 and row3 have 2s. So the 2s are not replaced. But in the output, new 3s are added. So maybe the 3s are being added based on the positions of the 2s and existing 3s. For example, if there's a 2, then in the output, certain cells adjacent to the 2s are turned into 3s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are forming a path that connects all existing 3s and 2s. For example, in example0's output, there's a continuous line of 3s from the 2s down to the bottom. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a directional component. In example0's output, the 3s in row6 are in a horizontal line. That could be a row filled with 3s from left to right. How does that row relate to the 2s in row2 and row3? Maybe the 3s are filling the rows between the 2s and the bottom of the grid. Or maybe it's the other way around.\n\nAlternatively, think of the numbers as representing different elements. Maybe 8 is a wall, 0 is empty, 2 is a starting point, and 3 is a path. The transformation could be creating a path (3s) from the 2s, moving downward until they hit a wall (8) or another number. Then, when they hit a wall, they spread horizontally. But this is speculative.\n\nAnother observation: in all training examples, the output seems to have more 3s than the input. The 3s form horizontal lines or blocks. For example, in example0's output, row6 is all 3s except the last element. The input row6 was all 0s. So this suggests that some rule is causing a whole row to be filled with 3s when certain conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a row contains a 2 or a 3, the next row is filled with 3s in the same columns. But in example0, the 2s are in rows2 and3, and the filled 3s are in rows4,5,6. So maybe each 2 or 3 in a row causes the next row to have 3s in the same columns, propagating downward until a non-zero is hit.\n\nWait, let's take example0:\n\nInput rows2 and3 have 2s. In the output, rows4,5,6 have 3s in the same column as the 2s. Then, row6 has a full horizontal line. Maybe the 3s are falling down until they hit something, then spreading horizontally.\n\nIn example0's row2 (input) has a 2. The output row2 still has 2. The next row (row3) has a 2. Output row3 still has 2. Then row4 and row5 have 3 in the same column as the 2. Then row6 has a horizontal line. So maybe the 3s are generated below the 2s, and once they reach a certain point, they spread left and right.\n\nBut how does that explain the horizontal line in example0's row6? Maybe after a certain number of steps, the 3s start spreading horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that each 2 in the input creates a vertical line of 3s downward starting from the cell below until a non-zero is hit, and each 3 in the input creates a horizontal line of 3s to the right until a non-zero is hit.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with example0:\n\nThe input has 2 in row2, column17 (assuming rows are 0-based). The cell below (row3, column17) is 2 in the input. So in the output, row4, column17 becomes 3, then row5, column17 becomes 3. Then, row6, column17 would be next, but in the input, row6's column17 is 0, so it becomes 3. But in the output, row6 has 3s from column3 to 17. So perhaps once the vertical line reaches a certain point, it starts filling horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after a vertical line of 3s, the horizontal spread starts. For example, in example0, the vertical line of 3s from the 2s in row2 and row3 would go down to row6, then spread left to fill the entire row.\n\nBut how does that work? Maybe when a 3 reaches the bottom of the grid or a non-zero cell, it starts spreading horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, the horizontal spread could be triggered by something else, like if a 3 is placed next to another 3.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try applying this hypothesis to the test input.\n\nTest input row1 has 2s in columns6 and7. So applying the vertical fill down:\n\nStarting from row1, column6 and7 (2s), fill downward with 3s until a non-zero. Looking at the test input's rows below row1:\n\nRow2: [0,8,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns6 and7 are 0.\n\nRow3: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8] \u2192 columns6 and7 are 0.\n\nRow4: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8] \u2192 column6 is 8 (non-zero), column7 is 0.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0] \u2192 columns6 and7 are 0 and 0.\n\nWait, but row4's column6 is 8. So for the 2s in row1, columns6 and7:\n\nFor column6: fill down from row1 to row3 (since row4, column6 is 8). So rows2,3 would get 3s in column6.\n\nFor column7: fill down from row1 to row3, and row4's column7 is 0, row5's column7 is 0. So rows2-5 column7 would get 3s.\n\nThen, for each of these 3s, fill to the right until non-zero.\n\nSo row2, column6 becomes 3. Filling to the right: columns6 and7 would be 3s until non-zero. Row2's columns6 and7 are 0, so they become 3s. Then, column8 is 0 \u2192 becomes 3. But row2's original input is [0,8,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], so filling to the right would turn columns6-8 into 3s. But maybe until a non-zero is hit. But row2's column9 is 0. Wait, this could get complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after placing the vertical 3s, each of those 3s will fill their entire row to the right until a non-zero. So for example, row2's column6 is 3, so fill to the right: columns6,7,8, etc. until a non-zero. Row2's original columns6-9 are 0,0,0,0. So those would become 3s. But the output for row2 might be [0,8,0,0,8,8,3,3,3,3,0,0,0]. But the actual expected output would depend on the pattern.\n\nThis is getting a bit time-consuming. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother approach: in the training examples, the 3s in the output are always forming a contiguous block that's connected either vertically or horizontally. It seems like the 3s are being filled in between existing 3s and 2s, possibly in a way that connects them.\n\nFor example, in example0's output, the 3s form a kind of path from the 2s down to the bottom and then spread horizontally. Maybe the rule is that from each 2, you flood fill all connected 0s in the downward direction and then horizontally to the right and left.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s might be filling in a specific direction based on the position of the 2s. \n\nAlternatively, the 3s could be forming a \"water flow\" effect, where they move down as far as possible and then spread horizontally.\n\nLet's consider that when a 2 is present, it causes 3s to fill downward in the same column until a non-zero is hit, and then spread horizontally in both directions from there until non-zero cells are hit.\n\nFor example, in example0:\n\nThe 2 in row2, column17 fills down to row6 (assuming rows are 0-based), then spreads horizontally left and right in row6 until hitting 8s. So row6 becomes all 3s except the last element (which is 8). That matches the output.\n\nSimilarly, in example1:\n\nThe 2s in row6 and7, column5 fill up (maybe upwards?) but example1's output has a horizontal line in row3. Wait, maybe if the 2s fill down, but the example1's output has the horizontal line in row3, which is above the 2s. That contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s flow upwards from the 2s. But in example0's case, the 3s are below the 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try to think of the test input's expected output based on the examples.\n\nIn the test input's row7, there are two 3s in columns3 and4. According to the examples, existing 3s may cause filling to the right. So in row7, columns3 and4 are 3s. Filling to the right, turning 0s to 3s until a non-zero. The row7 input is [8,0,8,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]. So columns3-4 are 3s. The next columns are 0 (column5), 0 (6), 0 (7), etc., until column10 is 8. So filling to the right would make columns5-9 into 3s. So row7's output would be [8,0,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,0,0].\n\nBut also, the test input's row1 has 2s in columns6 and7. Following the pattern, those 2s would be sources for 3s. If the rule is to fill downward from 2s:\n\nRow1, columns6 and7 are 2s. Fill down each column until a non-zero is found.\n\nFor column6:\n\nRow2: 0 \u2192 becomes 3.\n\nRow3: 0 \u2192 3.\n\nRow4: 0 \u2192 3.\n\nRow5: 0 \u21923.\n\nRow6:0\u21923.\n\nRow7:0\u21923.\n\nRow8:0\u21923.\n\nRow9:8 \u2192 stop. So columns6 in rows2-8 become 3s.\n\nFor column7:\n\nRow2:0\u21923.\n\nRow3:0\u21923.\n\nRow4:0\u21923.\n\nRow5:0\u21923.\n\nRow6:0\u21923.\n\nRow7:0\u21923.\n\nRow8:0\u21923.\n\nRow9:8 \u2192 stop.\n\nThen, for each of these new 3s, fill to the right until non-zero.\n\nSo, for example, row2's column6 is 3. Fill to the right: columns6,7,8, etc. until a non-zero. Row2's columns6-8 are 0, so they become 3s. But column9 is 0 \u2192 continue? Until a non-zero. But the original input row2 is [0,8,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So column6-9 are 0,0,0,0. So filling to the right would turn them into 3s. Similarly, row3's column6 is 3. Filling to the right until non-zero. Row3's input is [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8]. Columns6 is 0,7 is 0,8 is 8. So columns6 and7 would become 3s.\n\nThis way, each 3 generated from the 2's column would expand to the right until a non-zero.\n\nPutting this all together, the test input's output would have:\n\nRow1: [8,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 the 2s are replaced with 3s? Or remain as 2s. Looking at the examples, the 2s in the input remain as 2s in the output. So the output for row1 would still have 2s. But the 3s are filled in the columns below.\n\nSo row1's 2s would stay as 2s. Then, in rows2-8 of columns6 and7, there would be 3s. And each of those 3s would spread to the right until non-zero.\n\nFor example, row2's columns6-9 would become 3s. Row3's columns6-7 become 3s. Row4's columns6-7 become 3s until column6 is 8 in row4. Wait, row4's input is [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8]. Column6 is 8. So when filling down from row1's column6, row4's column6 is 8, so the vertical fill stops at row3. So rows2 and3's column6 would have 3s, and row4's column6 is 8.\n\nThen, row2's column6 is 3. Fill to the right until non-zero. Row2's columns6-8 are 0,0,0. So they become 3s. Column9 is 0 \u2192 also 3. So row2's columns6-9 are 3s.\n\nRow3's column6 is 3. Original row3's columns6-8 are 0,0,0, but column8 is 8. So columns6 and7 become 3s (up to column7, since column8 is 8).\n\nThis is getting quite involved, but applying this pattern would result in specific changes. Now, the test input's row7 has existing 3s in columns3-4. According to the pattern, these 3s would fill to the right. So in row7, columns3-4 are 3s. To the right, column5 is 0, column6-9 are 0. So those would become 3s until column10, which is 8. So row7's columns3-9 become 3s.\n\nPutting all this together, the test output would have various 3s filled in columns6 and7 downward and to the right, and row7's 3s spreading to the right.\n\nSo the final answer would look like:\n\n[8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,8,0,0,8,8,3,3,3,3,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,8,0,0,0,3,3,8,0,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,8,0,0,0,8,3,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,8,0,0,0,3,8,0,8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,8,0,0]\n\n[8,0,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,0,0]\n\n[0,8,8,0,0,8,3,3,0,0,8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,8,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nBut I need to make sure this aligns with the examples. For instance, in example0's output, the 2s remain, and 3s are added. The horizontal line in row6 of example0 is due to the 3s spreading to the right from a vertical fill.\n\nThus, the pattern seems to be: for each 2 in the input, fill all cells downward in the same column with 3s until a non-zero cell is hit. Then, for each 3 (original or generated), fill all cells to the right in the same row with 3s until a non-zero cell is hit.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nThe 2s are in row1, columns6 and7. Fill downward in those columns:\n\nFor column6:\n\nRow1: 2 \u2192 remains.\n\nRow2: 0 \u2192 3.\n\nRow3: 0 \u21923.\n\nRow4:8 \u2192 stop. So rows2 and3, column6 become3.\n\nFor column7:\n\nRow1:2 \u2192 remains.\n\nRow2:0 \u21923.\n\nRow3:0 \u21923.\n\nRow4:0 \u21923.\n\nRow5:0 \u21923.\n\nRow6:0 \u21923.\n\nRow7:0 \u21923.\n\nRow8:0 \u21923.\n\nRow9:8 \u2192 stop. So rows2-8, column7 become3.\n\nThen, for each 3 in these positions, fill to the right:\n\nRow2, column6:3 \u2192 fill to the right until non-zero. Row2's columns6-9 are 0s (original input), so they become3s up to column10 which is0 \u2192 fill all. Wait, but the original row2 is [0,8,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Columns6-9 are 0,0,0,0. Filling to the right, columns6-9 become3s.\n\nSimilarly, row2's column7 is3 (from column7 fill), which would also fill to the right. But since we're processing each 3 once, maybe overlapping is handled.\n\nRow3, column6:3 \u2192 fill to the right. Row3's columns6-7 are0,0. Columns8 is8. So columns6-7 become3s.\n\nRow3, column7:3 \u2192 fill to the right. Columns7-7 is already 3. Column8 is8. So no change.\n\nRow4's column7:3 \u2192 fill to the right. Row4's columns7-8 are0,0. Column9 is0. So columns7-9 become3s. But row4's original input is [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8]. Column7 is0. So filled to column9.\n\nThis process continues for each row and column where a 3 is placed.\n\nFor the existing 3s in row7, columns3 and4: each of these 3s will fill to the right. So row7's columns3-4 are3, then columns5-9 (0s) become3s until column10 is8.\n\nPutting all this together, the test output would have several 3s added based on the 2s and existing 3s.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples, then apply that pattern to the test input. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the training examples to see what's going on. Let's start with Example 0. The input and output look almost the same, but there are some changes. Let me compare them row by row.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nIn row 4 (0-indexed?), the input ends with 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. The output changes the 0 at position 17 to 3. Similarly, row 5 in the input has a 0 at position 17, which becomes 3 in the output. Then in row 6, there's a whole stretch of 3s replacing some 0s. It seems like whenever there's a 2 in the input, maybe there's a path of 3s leading up to it? Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 2 has a 2 at position 17. Then in the output, rows 4 and 5 have 3s at position 17, and row 6 has a line of 3s. Wait, in row 6 of the input, it's all 0s except the 8 at the end. The output for row 6 replaces a bunch of 0s with 3s, forming a horizontal line from position 3 to 17 (assuming 0-based). But the 2 is in row 2, position 17. Hmm. Maybe the 3s are forming a vertical path upwards from the 2?\n\nWait, let's look at Example 1. The input has a 2 in row 6, position 5. In the output, rows 3 to 5 have 3s leading up to that 2. For instance, row 3 in the output has a bunch of 3s from position 1 to 5. Then row 4 has a 3 at position 5. So it looks like the 3s are forming a path upwards from the 2, perhaps filling the cells directly above and to the left or right?\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the input has a 2 in row 9, positions 2 and 3. The output replaces those 2s with 3s in some way. Wait, in the input of Example 2, row 9 has 2,2. The output changes the 2s to 2,2 but adds 3s around them? Wait no, looking closer: the output row 9 is [8,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the 2s are followed by 3s. But the 2 is at position 5 in Example 1, and the 3s form a vertical path up to it. \n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that wherever there is a '2' in the input, the output replaces all cells in the same column above the 2 (upwards) with 3s until they hit a non-zero cell. Let me check that.\n\nTake Example 0. The 2 is in row 2, position 17. In the output, looking at column 17, rows 4,5,6,7,...? Let's see:\n\nIn row 2 (input), the 2 is present. Then in the output, row 4 (same column 17) becomes 3. Row 5's position 17 becomes 3. Row 6 has a long line of 3s starting from position 3 (maybe that's a different direction). Wait, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are filling the area to the left of the 2s. In Example 1, the 2 is in row 6, column 5. The output for row 3 has 3s from column 1 to 5. That's to the left of the 2, but also in the same column. So maybe it's filling left from the 2's position in a horizontal line, but how far?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are creating a path from the 2 upwards, moving left or right when blocked. Or perhaps the 3s are filling the cells to the left of the 2 in the same row and upwards.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 2 is in row 2, column 17. The output rows below it (rows 4,5,6) have 3s in column 17. Wait, row 4 is two rows below row 2. That seems like the 3s are spreading downward? But the examples may differ. Maybe the direction varies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are filling all cells in the same row as the 2, starting from the 2 and moving left until they hit a non-zero value. Let's check Example 1. The 2 is in row 6, column 5. The output in row 6 has 3s from column 1 to 5. Wait, no. The input row 6 is [0,8,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0], output is [0,8,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. So the 2 remains, but the 3s are in row 3. Hmm. That complicates things.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the row 3 (input was [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8]) becomes [0,3,3,3,3,3,8,0,0,8]. So the 3s are filling from column 1 to 5 in row 3, which is three rows above the 2. How does that connect?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 2 in the input creates a vertical line of 3s upwards until a block (non-zero) is hit. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1, the 2 is at (row 6, column 5). The output's row 3 (same column 5) has 3. Then row 4, column 5 is 3. Row 5, column 5 is 3. Then row 6, column 5 is 2. So it's a vertical line from row 3 to row 6, column 5. But the input in row 3, column 5 was 0. So the 3s are filling upwards from the 2. Wait, but the 3s start in row 3 and go down to row 6. That would be the opposite direction. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s fill upward from the 2, replacing all 0s in the same column until a non-zero is found. Let's check Example 1. The 2 is in row 6, column 5. The output has 3s in column 5 starting from row 3 up to row 5. But row 3's original input in column 5 was 0. So the 3s are filling upwards from the 2's column, but how many rows?\n\nIn Example 1's output, row 3 column 5 is 3, row 4 column 5 is 3, row 5 column 5 is 3. So that's three rows above the 2. But why does row 3 have 3s in columns 1-5? That's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the 3s are filling to the left in the same row as the 2 and upwards. Let's look at Example 1 again. The 2 is at row 6, column 5. The output's row 3 has 3s from column 1 to 5. That's three rows above, and spanning left. Maybe the 3s form a path that starts at the 2 and moves left and up, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s form a diagonal path. For Example 1, moving up and left from the 2. Let's see: row 6, column 5 (2) \u2192 row 5, column 4 \u2192 row 4, column 3, etc. But in the output, row 3 has 3s from columns 1-5. That doesn't fit a diagonal.\n\nThis is getting a bit tricky. Let me look at Example 2. The 2s are in row 9, columns 1 and 2. The output for row 9 has 3s starting from column 3 to 7. Wait, the input row 9 is [8,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0], and the output is [8,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So the 3s are to the right of the 2s, filling the next five positions. Also, in row 6 of the output, the 3s are in column 7 (position 7). The 2s are in row 9, columns 1 and 2. How does that connect?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are filling the cells to the right of the 2s. In Example 2, after the 2s, the next cells to the right in the same row are filled with 3s until a non-zero is hit. So in row 9, after the two 2s, the next five 0s are replaced with 3s. But why five? Because maybe the number of 3s is related to the number of 2s? Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 2 is in row 2, column 17. In the output, row 6 has a stretch of 3s from column 3 to 17. That's 15 positions. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are forming a horizontal line from the 2 to the left edge, but only if there are 0s. Let's check Example 1 again. The 2 is in column 5, row 6. The output row 3 has 3s from columns 1-5. That's a horizontal line from column 1 to 5 in row 3. But how does row 3 relate to the 2's row 6? There's a gap of three rows. Maybe the 3s are forming a vertical line upwards from the 2, and then a horizontal line to the left.\n\nIn Example 1, if the 2 is at (6,5), then moving up each row, the cell (5,5) becomes 3, (4,5) becomes 3, (3,5) becomes 3. Then in row 3, from column 1 to 5, all 0s become 3s. So it's like once you reach row 3, column 5, you also fill leftwards to column 1. So the 3s form a vertical line up from the 2 to row 3, then leftwards to the edge.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 0's row 2, the 2 is at (2,17). Then in the output, rows 4,5,6 have 3s in column 17. Then in row 6, the 3s start at column 3 and go to 17. So maybe after moving up a few rows from the 2, then leftwards.\n\nIn Example 2's output, the 2s are at (9,1) and (9,2), and the 3s start at column 3 in the same row and go to column 7. Then, in row 6, column 7 becomes 3. So perhaps from the 2s, the 3s spread right and then upwards?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's try to find a common pattern across examples.\n\nAnother approach: in all outputs, the 2s remain in the same positions as the input, but there are 3s added in certain paths. The 3s are always added in positions that were 0 in the input, so the transformation is replacing 0s with 3s based on the presence of 2s.\n\nThe key is to determine how the 3s are placed relative to the 2s. Let's look for the direction and how far they extend.\n\nIn Example 1, the 2 is in row 6, column 5. The output adds 3s in column 5 from row 3 to 5. Then, in row 3, columns 1-5 are 3s. So perhaps the rule is: from each 2, move up three rows, then fill left until a non-zero is found.\n\nBut why three rows? In Example 1, moving up from row 6 (2's row) to row 3 is three steps. Then filling left from column 5 to column 1. But row 3's original columns 1-5 were 0s, so they become 3s.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 is in row 2, column 17. The output has 3s in column 17 in rows 4,5,6, but also row 6 has 3s from column 3 to 17. So perhaps from the 2's position, moving down three rows (from row 2 to row 5: 3 rows down?), but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe moving up three rows from the 2's row. But row 2 minus 3 would be row -1, which doesn't exist. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each 2, we create a vertical line of 3s upward for three rows, then fill left. But Example 1's 2 is at row 6. Up three rows would be row 3. Then fill left from column 5 to 1. That matches Example 1.\n\nIn Example 0's 2 is at row 2. Up three rows would be row -1, which isn't possible. So perhaps the rule is to fill upward as much as possible, up to three rows, and then left. For Example 0, since row 2 is near the top, maybe filling upward until the top, then left.\n\nBut Example 0's output has 3s in row 6, which is below the 2's row. So that complicates things. Maybe the direction is not upward but downward. But in Example 1, the 3s are above the 2. Wait, no. In Example 1, the 2 is at row 6, and the 3s are in rows 3,4,5. That's above. But in Example 0, the 3s are in rows 4,5,6, which are below the 2 at row 2. So the direction varies.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that maybe the 3s are not strictly upward or downward. Another idea: perhaps the 3s form a cross shape around the 2s, but only in certain directions.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the numbers 3 and 2: maybe the 3s are forming a path that connects to the 2s. For instance, the 3s are the path leading to the 2, which might represent something like a door (2) with a path (3s) leading to it.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0, the 2 is in row 2, column 17. The output has 3s in column 17 in rows 4,5,6. Also, row 6 has a horizontal line of 3s from column 3 to 17. So perhaps the 3s form a vertical line from the 2 down to row 6, then left to column 3.\n\nIn Example 1, the 2 is in row 6, column 5. The 3s are in column 5 from rows 3 to 5, then in row 3, columns 1-5. So vertical up to row 3, then left.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2s are in row 9, columns 1 and 2. The output has 3s in row 9 from columns 3-7. Then in row 6, column 7, and row 8, column 7. So maybe after filling to the right in the same row, then up.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Maybe the rule is that each 2 generates a vertical line of 3s upwards for three cells, then a horizontal line to the left for five cells, but that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of 3s is determined by the number of 2s. For example, each 2 causes three 3s in a certain direction. But in Example 0, there's one 2, and multiple 3s.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the positions of the 3s in the input. In Example 0's input, there are 3s in row 14 and 15, columns 3 and 4. But the output's 3s are in different positions, so the input 3s are irrelevant. The output 3s are generated based on the 2s.\n\nLet me think again. The common pattern across examples is that wherever there's a 2 in the input, the output replaces certain 0s with 3s in a pattern that connects to the 2. The exact direction and spread of 3s varies, but perhaps the rule is:\n\nFor each 2 in the input, create a horizontal line of 3s extending to the left starting from the 2's position, and then create a vertical line upwards from the end of that horizontal line. But how far?\n\nAlternatively, in Example 1, the 2 is at (6,5). The horizontal line in row 3 is from column 1-5. Then the vertical line is from row 3-6, column 5. So the horizontal line is three rows above the 2, and spans left to column 1. The vertical line connects back down to the 2. This forms a sort of upside-down L shape.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 is at (2,17). The vertical line starts at row 6, column 17, and goes up to row 4 (rows 4,5,6 have 3 in column 17). Then a horizontal line from column 3 to 17 in row 6. So it's an L-shape but mirrored.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2s are at (9,1) and (9,2). The horizontal line in row 9 is from columns 3-7. Then in row 6, column 7, there's a 3. Maybe a vertical line upwards from column 7. So the shape here is a horizontal line to the right, then up.\n\nThis seems like the 3s are forming a path that moves left or right and then up. The direction varies per example, which makes it hard. But maybe the rule is:\n\nFor each 2 in the input:\n\n1. Move three cells to the left in the same row. If there's a non-zero cell, stop. Otherwise, fill those cells with 3s.\n\n2. Then move up three rows from that leftmost cell and fill to the left again.\n\nBut this is a guess. Alternatively, maybe the 3s form a specific geometric shape relative to the 2.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 3s added corresponds to the value of the 2. But since 2 is a single digit, that's not likely.\n\nAnother idea: in Example 0, the output row 6 has 3s from column 3 to 17. The 2 is at column 17, row 2. So maybe the 3s are filling from the 2's column leftwards for a certain number of steps. For example, 15 steps (17-3+1=15). But why 15?\n\nAlternatively, the 3s are filling all cells to the left of the 2 in the same row until a non-zero is found. In Example 0's row 6, the 2 is in column 17. The 3s start at column 3, so maybe from column 3 to 17. But why column 3? Maybe because in the input row 6, there's an 8 at column 18 (if the row length is 20). Wait, the input rows vary in length. For example, Example 0's input rows have 20 elements each. The test input has rows of varying lengths. So the row length depends on the input.\n\nWait, in Example 0's row 6 input: [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]. The output is [8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0]. So the 3s start at position 3 (0-based) and go to 17, which is column 17. The 2 is in row 2, column 17. So maybe from the 2's column, fill left in the same row until an 8 is hit. But in row 6, the leftmost 3 starts at column 3. What's in column 3 of the input? In row 6's input, column 3 is 0. So why start at 3? Maybe there's an 8 in column 2. Let's see:\n\nRow 6 input: [8, 0, 0, 0, ...]. So column 0 is 8. Then columns 1 and 2 are 0. So the 3s start at column 3 and go to 17. So between column 3 and 17, all 0s become 3s. But why not start at column 0? Because column 0 is 8, so the 3s start after the first non-zero cell to the left of the 2's column.\n\nWait, the 2 is in column 17 of row 2. The 3s in row 6 start at column 3. How are these connected?\n\nMaybe the 3s are filling a path from the 2's position to the nearest edge, but navigating around obstacles. This is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: comparing input and output for each example where there's a 2.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2 is in row 2, column 17. The output adds 3s in column 17 in rows 4,5,6 and a horizontal line in row 6 from column 3 to 17.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 2 is in row 6, column 5. The output adds 3s in column 5 from row 3 to 5 and a horizontal line in row 3 from column 1 to 5.\n\nIn Example 2's input, the 2s are in row 9, columns 1 and 2. The output adds a horizontal line in row 9 from column 3 to 7 and vertical lines in rows 6,7,8 at column 7.\n\nSo the pattern might be:\n\n1. For each 2 in the input, determine a certain number of cells to the left (maybe 4?) and then up.\n\nBut in Example 0, the horizontal line is 15 cells long. That's too many.\n\nAlternatively, for each 2, create a horizontal line of 3s to the left for 5 cells, then a vertical line up for 3 cells.\n\nExample 1's horizontal line in row 3 is 5 cells (columns 1-5), then vertical line down to row 6. But that's 3 rows (row 3 to 6). \n\nExample 0's horizontal line in row 6 is 15 cells (columns 3-17), which is more than 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line extends until the nearest non-zero cell to the left. In Example 0's row 6, the leftmost 3 is at column 3. Looking at the input row 6, columns 0 is 8, columns 1-2 are 0. So perhaps the 3s start after the first non-zero cell (column 0) and fill to the right until the 2's column. But in this case, the 2 is in row 2, not row 6. So that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s are filling a path from the 2 to the nearest edge, but the direction depends on the example. This seems too vague.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that each 2 generates a horizontal line of 3s to the left in its row, then from the start of that line, a vertical line upwards. The length of the horizontal line is 5 cells, and the vertical line is 3 cells. But Example 0's horizontal line is longer than 5, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical line is three cells long, and the horizontal line is as long as possible until a non-zero is found. For Example 1, the horizontal line in row 3 starts at column 1 (the first cell after non-zero?) and goes to column 5. The vertical line from row 3 to 6 (3 cells down). \n\nIn Example 0, the vertical line from row 4 to 6 (3 cells) and the horizontal line from column 3 to 17 (15 cells). So maybe the horizontal line starts at column (17 - 3) = 14? No, it starts at 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think differently. The output 3s might form a kind of arrow pointing to the 2. For example, in Example 1, the 3s form a vertical line down to the 2, with a horizontal line to the left at the top of the vertical line. So it looks like an arrow pointing to the 2 from above and to the left.\n\nIn Example 0, the 3s form a vertical line below the 2 and then a horizontal line to the left. So maybe the arrow is pointing down and left.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3s are to the right of the 2s in the same row and then go up. So maybe the arrow points right and up.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the direction of the arrow depends on the surrounding cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the 3s form a specific shape that is mirrored in each example. For instance, a kind of 'L' shape, but the direction varies.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the rule is that for each 2 in the input, replace all cells to the left in the same row with 3s until a non-zero cell, then move up three rows and repeat the process. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the 3s are filling a rectangle or other shape around the 2.\n\nLet's look at the test input to see if we can spot where the 3s should be added.\n\nThe test input has a 2 in row 1, columns 6 and 7 (indices 5 and 6 if 0-based). Wait, let's check:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow 0: [8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [8,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,8,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [8,0,8,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,8,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 10: [0,8,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 11: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nSo the 2s are in row 1, columns 6 and 7 (values 2,2). Also, row 7 has 3,3 in columns 3 and 4. But in the input, those are already 3s, so perhaps they are part of the input and need to be considered.\n\nThe expected output for the test input would have 3s added based on the 2s. Let's think: according to the examples, wherever there's a 2, the output adds 3s in a certain pattern. For the test input, since there are two 2s in row 1, columns 6 and 7, the 3s would be added in a pattern related to these positions.\n\nLooking at Example 1, which has a single 2 in row 6, column 5. The output adds a vertical line of 3s from row 3 to 5 in column 5, then a horizontal line to the left in row 3. So for each 2, maybe the pattern is:\n\n1. From the 2's position, move up three rows.\n\n2. In that row, fill 3s from the leftmost possible to the column of the 2.\n\n3. Then fill down from that row to the original 2's row, in the same column.\n\nSo for the test input's 2s in row 1, columns 6 and 7:\n\n- For each 2, move up three rows: row 1 -3 = row -2 (invalid), so perhaps just fill as much as possible upwards.\n\nBut since row 1 is the second row (0-based), subtracting 3 would give a negative row, which isn't possible. So maybe in such cases, the vertical line starts from the 2's row and goes down three rows. \n\nAlternatively, since we can't move up three rows, the horizontal line is created to the left of the 2's column in the same row.\n\nBut in Example 0, the 2 is in row 2, and the horizontal line is in row 6, which is four rows below. This doesn't fit a three-row rule.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let's try to see if there's any other pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input's row 7: [8,0,8,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]. The existing 3s here might interfere, but according to the training examples, input 3s are not modified (like in Example 0's input has 3s in row 14 and 15, but the output's 3s are in different places). So the output 3s are only those added based on the 2s.\n\nSo for the test input's 2s in row 1, columns 6 and 7:\n\nLooking at the other examples, perhaps the 3s will form a horizontal line to the left of the 2s in their row, then a vertical line downward.\n\nBut since row 1 is near the top, the vertical line can't go up, so it goes down.\n\nFor example, in row 1, columns 6 and 7 have 2s. The output would fill 3s to the left of these 2s in the same row until a non-zero is hit. Let's see: row 1's input is [8,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. So columns 0 is 8, columns 5 is 8, columns 6 and 7 are 2s. So between columns 5 (8) and 6 (2) there's a 0. So filling left from column 6: columns 6,5 are 2 and 8. So between them, column 5 is 8, so the left of the 2 is column 5, which is non-zero. So no space to fill. Similarly, the left of column 7 (2) is column 6 (2), which is also a 2. So perhaps the horizontal line can't be formed. Alternatively, maybe the 3s are added to the right of the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical line is added below the 2s. For each 2 in row 1, columns 6 and 7, add 3s in the same column in the rows below. For example, rows 2,3,4,5. Then in row 5, columns 6 and 7, fill 3s to the left until a non-zero is hit.\n\nBut row 1's columns 6 and 7 are 2s. Moving down three rows would be rows 4,5,6. In those rows, columns 6 and 7:\n\n- Row 2: columns 6 and 7 are 0 and 0.\n- Row 3: columns 6 is 0, 7 is 0.\n- Row 4: column 6 is 0, 7 is 0.\n- Row 5: column 6 is 0, 7 is 0.\n- Row 6: column 6 is 0, 7 is 0.\n\nSo filling those with 3s. Then, in row 5, columns 6 and 7, fill left until a non-zero.\n\nRow 5's input is [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0]. So columns 3 is 8. So filling left from column 6 to 3 would replace columns 3-6 with 3s. But that's not how the examples work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is three cells down, then a horizontal line to the left for five cells. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make an educated guess based on the examples. The pattern seems to be that for each 2, we add a vertical line of 3s upwards for three rows, then a horizontal line to the left in the topmost row of that vertical line. If moving up three rows isn't possible, adjust accordingly.\n\nIn the test input, the 2s are in row 1. So moving up three rows isn't possible. So perhaps the horizontal line is in the same row as the 2s, and the vertical line is downwards. For example, from row 1, columns 6 and 7, add vertical lines down three rows (rows 2,3,4), then in row 4, columns 6 and 7, fill left to the nearest non-zero.\n\nLooking at row 4's input: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8]. Column 6 is 8. So filling left from column 6 would stop at column 6. So perhaps the horizontal line starts at column 6 and goes left until column 0. But in row 4, column 3 is 8. So filling from column 6 to 3 would be columns 3-6. Those are zeros in row 4's input. So replacing them with 3s.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Based on Example 1, where the vertical line was three rows up, then a horizontal line left, maybe for the test input's 2s in row 1, the vertical line would go down three rows to row 4, then left from column 6 to the nearest non-zero (column 3, which is 8). So in row 4, columns 3-6 would become 3s.\n\nAdditionally, the vertical line from row 1 to 4 in columns 6 and 7 would have 3s.\n\nBut since there are two 2s in columns 6 and 7, perhaps both columns get vertical lines and horizontal lines.\n\nSo for each 2 in column 6 and 7 of row 1:\n\n- Create a vertical line down to row 4 (three rows down).\n- In row 4, fill left from columns 6 and 7 to the nearest non-zero (which is column 3 for column 6, and column 6 for column 7, but column 7's left is column 6, which is part of the same vertical line.\n\nThis is getting complex, but let's try to apply it.\n\nTest input's row 1 has 2s in columns 6 and 7. For each 2:\n\nVertical line down to row 4 (rows 1, 2, 3, 4), so three steps. Then in row 4, fill left from column 6 and 7.\n\nRow 4's input is [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8]. Column 6 is 8. So filling left from column 6 would stop at column 6. But that's an 8. So perhaps no horizontal line here. Alternatively, the horizontal line is to the left until the next non-zero. So column 6 is 8, so the left of that is columns 0-5. But in row 4, column 3 is 8. So from column 6 (8), moving left to column 3 (8), the cells between are 0s. So maybe filling columns 4-5 with 3s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each vertical line in column 6 and 7, the horizontal line would start at row 4 and go left until they hit a non-zero. For column 6: row 4's column 6 is 8, so no fill. For column 7: row 4's column 7 is 0. Fill left until 8 is found. Column 7 to left: column 6 is 8. So fill column 7 only. So no horizontal line. This doesn't seem right.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to format the test input with the 3s added based on the observed patterns, even if I'm not entirely sure. In the test input, the 2s are in row 1, columns 6 and 7. Following the pattern from Example 1, where the vertical line went up three rows and then left, but since here we can't go up three rows (row 1 is the second row), perhaps the vertical line goes down three rows. So from row 1 to row 4. Then in row 4, fill left from columns 6 and 7 until a non-zero is found.\n\nRow 4's columns 6 is 8, so no fill. Column 7 is 0. Moving left from column 7, the first non-zero is column 6 (8). So fill column 7 with 3. But that's only one cell. So the vertical lines would be in columns 6 and 7 from row 1 to 4, and in row 4, column 7 becomes 3. \n\nAdditionally, maybe in the same row as the 2s (row 1), fill left from columns 6 and 7. But row 1's column 5 is 8, so filling left from 6 would stop at 5. So columns 6 and 7 remain 2s. \n\nAlternatively, the horizontal line is in the row three steps down. For row 1, three steps down is row 4. So in row 4, columns 6 and 7, fill left until non-zero. For column 6, which is 8, no fill. For column 7, which is 0, fill left to column 6 (8), so only column 7 becomes 3. So the vertical line in column 7 from row 1 to 4 would have 3s, and column 7 in row 4 becomes 3.\n\nBut this seems too minimal. Looking at the examples, they often have larger sections of 3s. For instance, in Example 1, the 3s formed a horizontal line in row 3. So perhaps in the test input, the vertical line from row 1 to 4 in columns 6 and 7, and then in row 4, a horizontal line to the left from those columns until non-zero.\n\nBut in row 4, column 6 is 8, so no fill. Column 7 is 0. Moving left from 7, the first non-zero is column 6 (8). So column 7 becomes 3. That's one cell. But that's not a horizontal line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the horizontal line is to the right. For example, from column 6 and 7, fill right. But in row 4, columns 6 is 8, and 7 is 0. So column 7 would become 3. \n\nThis is getting too ambiguous. Based on the examples, I'll assume that for each 2, there's a vertical line of 3s downward three rows, then a horizontal line to the left in that row. So for the test input's 2s in row 1, columns 6 and 7:\n\n- Vertical line down to row 4 (three rows), so columns 6 and 7 in rows 2,3,4 become 3s.\n\n- In row 4, fill left from columns 6 and 7 until non-zero. Columns 6 is 8 (no fill), column 7's left is column 6 (8), so column 7 becomes 3.\n\nAdditionally, in row 4, columns 6 and 7: 8 and 3.\n\nThen, the horizontal line would be in row 4, column 7 is 3, but there's nothing to fill left. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the horizontal line is in row 4, starting from column 7 and moving left as far as possible. But column 6 is 8, so only column 7 is filled.\n\nThis doesn't produce a significant change. Alternatively, maybe the horizontal line is in row 4, columns 0-7, but that's unlikely.\n\nGiven that I'm not completely certain, but need to provide an answer, I'll proceed to modify the test input by adding vertical 3s below the 2s and a horizontal line in row 4. Let's see:\n\nIn row 1, columns 6 and 7 are 2s. The vertical line would be in columns 6 and 7 from rows 1 to 4. So rows 1,2,3,4 of columns 6 and 7 would become 3s (except row 1, which has 2s).\n\nSo:\n\nRow 1: [8,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 remains the same except the 2s.\n\nRows 2,3,4 columns 6 and 7:\n\nRow 2: columns 6 and 7 are 0,0 \u2192 become 3,3.\n\nRow 3: columns 6 and 7 are 0,0 \u2192 become 3,3.\n\nRow 4: column 6 is 8 (stays), column 7 is 0 \u2192 becomes 3.\n\nThen, in row 4, from column 7, move left until non-zero. Column 6 is 8, so column 7 becomes 3.\n\nThen, in row 4, perhaps fill left from column 7 to column 6 (but column 6 is 8), so no change. \n\nAdditionally, perhaps in row 4, column 7 is 3, and from there, we move up three rows and fill left. But this is getting too recursive.\n\nAlternatively, the horizontal line is in row 4, column 7 filled, and then leftwards. But in row 4, column 6 is 8. So no further left.\n\nSo the changes would be:\n\nRow 2: [0,8,0,0,8,8,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,8,0,0,0,3,3,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,3,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0] \u2192 unchanged except if any 3s are added.\n\nBut this doesn't create a horizontal line. To match the examples, there should be a horizontal line of 3s in one of the rows. Perhaps row 4's column 7 is 3, and the horizontal line is in row 4 from column 3 to 7. Because in row 4's input, column 3 is 0, and column 6 is 8. So filling from column 7 to 3 would require filling columns 3-7. But column 6 is 8, so filling columns 3-5 and 7. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the horizontal line is in row 4 from column 3 to 7, replacing 0s with 3s, except column 6 (8). So the output row 4 would be [0,0,8,3,3,3,8,3,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nThis would align with the idea that after the vertical line, we fill left from column 7 in row 4 until column 3 (which is 0 in input) but encountering column 6's 8. So the fill would stop at column 6, but since we're filling left from 7, columns 3-7 (excluding 6) become 3s. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to write the test output based on the pattern observed in the examples, assuming that for each 2, a vertical line is created downward three rows, then a horizontal line to the left in that row. For the test input, this would affect rows 2-4 in columns 6 and 7, and row 4 would have a horizontal line from column 3 to 7, with column 6 being 8.",
