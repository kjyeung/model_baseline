        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input is transformed into the output. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, there's a block of 4s in rows 1-3, then some 5s in the middle rows, and a sort of upside-down T shape made of 5s in rows 8-10. The output removes the vertical line of 5s and the horizontal line of 5s, keeping only the horizontal part but moving it up. Wait, in the input rows 4-7 have single 5s in column 3, and then rows 8-10 have a horizontal line of 5s. The output removes the vertical lines (rows 4-7's 5s) and shifts the horizontal part up to rows 4-6. So maybe it's moving certain blocks upward, removing the vertical parts.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 4 block that's shifted to the right in rows 5-7, and the output moves those 4s to the left. The 2s are in columns 7-13, and the 4s in the input are in columns 1-3 (row 5) but then expand in row 6. The output seems to move the 4s into a horizontal block aligned with the 2s. So maybe aligning different colored blocks horizontally?\n\nExample 2's input has a vertical line of 3s in the middle and a horizontal block at the bottom. The output removes the vertical line and keeps the horizontal block but moves it up. So the vertical parts are removed, and horizontal parts are kept or moved up.\n\nSo the pattern might be that for each color (number), any vertical lines (single columns) are removed, and only the horizontal blocks (rows) are kept. Alternatively, maybe merging or moving horizontal parts upward and eliminating vertical segments.\n\nLooking at the test input: There's a 3 in rows 3-10, forming a vertical block on the left (columns 1-5) and a 7 in rows 4-7. The 7s in row 4 are a horizontal line (columns 6-14), but in rows 5-6, the 7s are split, with some in columns 11-14. So perhaps the vertical 3s (the left part) and the 7s in row 4 (horizontal) would be kept, but the split 7s in rows 5-6 might be adjusted. Wait, in the input for the test, row 4 has a full horizontal 7s (columns 6-14), row 5 has 7s starting at column 12, and rows 6 have 7s starting at column 12 as well. So maybe the vertical part (like the split in 7s) would be removed, leaving only the full horizontal line. \n\nFollowing the pattern from examples, the output should retain the horizontal blocks and eliminate vertical or fragmented parts. For the 3s in the test input, they form a vertical stack from rows 3-10. But each row 3-10 for 3s is a horizontal block (columns 1-5). So maybe those horizontal blocks are kept as they are. However, in Example 0, the vertical line of 5s (single column) was removed. So perhaps if a color has both vertical and horizontal parts, the vertical parts (single columns) are removed, and horizontal blocks are kept. Wait in Example 0, the vertical line was single 5s in column 3, rows 4-7. These were removed, leaving the horizontal block (rows 8-10) moved up. So maybe vertical lines (single column) are removed, and horizontal lines (multiple columns) are kept. But in Example 2, the vertical 3s (columns 6-7?) were removed, but the horizontal block at the bottom (rows 3-8) were kept. Wait, no. In Example 2's input, there's a vertical line of 3s in column 7 (rows 3-6), and then a horizontal block of 3s starting from row 7. The output moved the horizontal block up. So perhaps the vertical lines are deleted, and any horizontal blocks are moved up to take their place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to collapse vertical structures into their horizontal counterparts. For instance, if there's a vertical line adjacent to a horizontal block, the vertical part is removed, and the horizontal part is shifted up. So in the test input's 7s: row 4 has a full horizontal line (columns 6-14), but rows 5-6 have 7s only starting at column 12. So those might be considered vertical fragments and removed, keeping only the full horizontal line in row 4. Similarly, the 3s are all in horizontal blocks each row (columns 1-5), so those would remain. Wait, but in Example 0, the horizontal block was moved up. So maybe any horizontal block that's part of a vertical structure is moved up, and the vertical parts are removed. Hmm.\n\nLet me re-examine Example 0. The input's 5s are a vertical line in rows 4-7 (column 3) and a horizontal line in rows 8-10 (columns 3-6). The output removes the vertical line and moves the horizontal line up to rows 4-6. So the horizontal part is shifted up where the vertical part was. So perhaps vertical structures (single column) are replaced by their corresponding horizontal blocks, moving them up. Similarly, in Example 1, the 4s in the input are arranged in a sort of vertical strip that's shifted right, but in the output, they're shifted left to form a horizontal block aligned with the 2s. So the pattern seems to be that for each color, any vertical segments (single columns) are removed, and their corresponding horizontal blocks are moved up to replace them.\n\nIn the test input, the 7s in row 4 are a full horizontal line. Rows 5-6 have 7s starting at column 12, which could be a vertical fragment. So those would be removed, leaving only row 4's 7s. The 3s in rows 3-10 are horizontal blocks (columns 1-5 each row). Since they are already horizontal, they remain. The vertical part (if any) would be removed, but here each row's 3s are horizontal. So the output would keep all the 3s as they are and the 7s in row 4. But looking at the test input's structure:\n\nInput rows (0-based? Or 1-based? The examples start with row 0 maybe):\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow 3: [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,...] (columns 1-5)\nRow 4: [0,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,...]\nRow 5: [0,3,...,7,7,7,7]\nRow 6: same as row 5.\n\nSo for 3s: each row from 3-10 has a horizontal block in columns 1-5, so those are all horizontal and should remain. The 7s in row 4 are a horizontal line from column 6-14. But rows 5 and 6 have 7s starting at column 12. So those are vertical? Not exactly. They are horizontal in their own rows but not part of a vertical structure. Wait, but maybe the 7s in rows 5-6 are vertical? Let me check. In row 5, columns 12-15 are 7s. In row 6, same. So vertically, columns 12-15, rows 5-6 have 7s. That's a 2-row high block. So in the output, those might be considered vertical and removed, leaving only the full horizontal line in row 4. So the output would have the 3s as they are, and the 7s only in row 4. So the 7s in rows 5-6 would be removed.\n\nSo the transformed test input would have:\n\nRows 3-10 (if 0-based, but in the test input, the first row is index 0?), let me count:\n\nThe test input has 12 rows. Let's list them:\n\nRow 0: all 0s\nRow 1: all 0s\nRow 2: all 0s\nRow 3: [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,...]\nRow 4: [0,3,...,7,7,7,7... up to column 14]\nRow 5: [0,3,...,7 starts at column 12]\nRow 6: same as row 5\nRow 7: [0,3,...,0s]\nRows 8-10: same as row 7\nRow 11: all 0s.\n\nIn the output, the 3s in rows 3-10 (columns 1-5) would remain as horizontal blocks. The 7s in row 4 (columns 6-14) are a horizontal line. The 7s in rows 5-6 (columns 12-15) are vertical? No, they are two rows of horizontal segments. Since they are in the same columns but not forming a vertical line (they are part of horizontal blocks), perhaps they are left as is. But according to the previous examples, maybe vertical segments (single column) are removed. Wait, in Example 1, the 4s were moved from a vertical arrangement (column 1-3 in row 5) to a horizontal block aligned with the 2s. So perhaps the idea is that for each color, any vertical segments (like single column or tall structures) are replaced by horizontal blocks aligned with other parts.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation might involve shifting certain blocks upward to merge with others. For instance, in Example 0, the vertical 5s were removed and the horizontal 5s moved up. So in the test input, the 7s in row 4 (full horizontal) would stay, and the 7s in rows 5-6 (partial) would be removed. The 3s are all horizontal, so they remain.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nRows 3-10 (assuming 0-based) for 3s as they are. The 7s in row 4 would remain, and the 7s in rows 5-6 would be removed, leaving 0s. The row 4's 7s are columns 6-14. So in row 4 of the output, columns 6-14 are 7s. Rows 5 and 6's 7s would become 0s.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, the vertical 3s were replaced by the horizontal block. So the vertical parts were removed, and the horizontal block (originally lower) was moved up. Similarly, in the test input, the 7s in row 4 are a full horizontal line, and the ones in rows 5-6 are a smaller horizontal part. But how do they relate? Maybe the full horizontal line is kept, and the partial ones (which are part of vertical structure) are removed. Alternatively, maybe any vertical structures (like multiple rows stacked in the same columns) are moved to the earliest possible row as a horizontal block.\n\nBut in Example 1, the 4s were shifted left. So perhaps the pattern is to take each color's blocks and shift them as far left or up as possible, merging with existing blocks. Alternatively, it's about aligning with other blocks of the same color.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation might be to collapse vertical runs into horizontal runs at the top. For example, in Example 0, the vertical 5s are replaced by moving the horizontal block up. So the vertical line (columns 3, rows 4-7) is replaced by the horizontal block (columns 3-6, rows 4-6). So the vertical line is removed, and the horizontal block is shifted up.\n\nIn the test input's 7s: the vertical part would be rows 5-6, columns 12-15. But in row 4, columns 6-14 are 7s, which is a horizontal line. The vertical part here is perhaps the part in rows 5-6, columns 12-15. But those are horizontal in their own rows. So maybe they're not vertical. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each color, all vertical lines (single columns) are removed, and any horizontal blocks are moved up to fill the space. So in the test input, the 3s are all horizontal, so they stay. The 7s in row 4 (horizontal) stay. The 7s in rows 5-6 are part of a vertical structure? Maybe not. So perhaps they remain. But according to the examples, maybe any vertical segments (even if part of a larger horizontal block) are removed. I'm a bit stuck here.\n\nAnother approach: Look for how the positions of numbers change between input and output in each example.\n\nIn Example 0's 5s:\n\nInput has vertical 5s (column 3, rows 4-7) and horizontal 5s (rows 8-10, columns 3-6). Output moves the horizontal 5s up to rows 4-6, replacing the vertical ones. So the vertical part is replaced by the horizontal part shifted up.\n\nIn Example 1's 4s:\n\nInput has a 4-block in row 5 (columns 1-3), row 6 (columns 1-4), row 7 (columns 1-3). The output shifts these 4s to columns 5-7 (rows 5-7), aligning with the 2s. So perhaps aligning horizontally with other blocks. But how?\n\nIn Example 2's 3s: Input has vertical 3s (column 7, rows 3-6) and a horizontal block (rows 7-12, columns 3-10). The output removes the vertical part and moves the horizontal block up to rows 3-8. So vertical parts are removed, horizontal parts shifted up.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For each color, any vertical segments (single columns) are removed, and the horizontal segments are shifted up to fill the space. So in the test input:\n\n- The 3s are horizontal in each row (columns 1-5) from rows 3-10. Since they are horizontal, they remain as is. No vertical parts to remove.\n\n- The 7s in row 4 are a horizontal line (columns 6-14). Then in rows 5-6, columns 12-15 are 7s. These are horizontal in their respective rows but perhaps form a vertical alignment. Wait, columns 12-15 in rows 5-6. So columns 12-15 have two rows of 7s. That's a 2-row high block, but each row is horizontal. So maybe these are considered vertical segments and are removed, leaving only row 4's 7s.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\n- All 3s in rows 3-10 (columns 1-5) as in the input.\n\n- 7s only in row 4 (columns 6-14), and rows 5-6 have 0s in those columns.\n\nBut in the test input, row 5 and 6 have 7s starting at column 12, so those would be replaced with 0s.\n\nSo putting it all together, the output would have the same 3s as input, and 7s only in row 4.\n\nLet me reconstruct the output rows:\n\nRow 0-2: all 0s.\n\nRow 3: [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (since the 7s here are removed)\n\nRow 6: same as row 5.\n\nRows 7-10: same as row 5.\n\nRow 11: all 0s.\n\nWait, but in the test input's row 5, the 7s start at column 12. So after transformation, those 7s would be 0s. So row 5 in the output would have 0s from column 6 onwards. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input row 5 (test input):\n\n[0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,0,0]\n\nIn the output, this becomes:\n\n[0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBecause the vertical alignment (if considered) of the 7s in rows 5 and 6 is removed. But according to the examples, vertical parts (like single columns) are removed. However, here, the 7s in rows 5-6 are in columns 12-15. So they form a horizontal block each in their own row, but vertically, they're a 2-row high block. So maybe this counts as vertical and is removed.\n\nTherefore, the output would have 7s only in row 4. So rows 4's 7s remain, and rows 5-6's 7s are replaced with 0s. Rows 7 and onwards have no 7s.\n\nSo the final output should look like this:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nYes, this aligns with the examples where vertical structures are removed, and horizontal blocks are kept. The 7s in row 4 are kept as a horizontal block, while the ones in rows 5-6 are removed. The 3s remain as they are horizontal in each row.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by looking at the examples closely.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has some 4s forming a horizontal block and some 5s arranged vertically and then a horizontal block. The output seems to move the vertical 5s into a horizontal block. The vertical lines of 5s in rows 4-7 (indices might be different) become a horizontal block starting at row 8. So maybe the pattern is moving vertical sequences into horizontal ones?\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a 4s structure that's kind of shifted. The output shifts the 4s to the right. In the input, the 4s start at column 1 and span 3 columns in row 5, but in the output, they're shifted to column 4. So perhaps it's moving certain blocks horizontally to align them next to other blocks of the same number.\n\nExample 2: The input has a vertical line of 3s in rows 3-6, column 7. The output moves those into a horizontal block in rows 3-8, columns 3-10. So the vertical line is transformed into a horizontal block adjacent to the existing horizontal 2s. Wait, but in the input, there's also a horizontal 3 block in rows 7-12. The output removes the vertical 3s and merges them into the horizontal ones. So maybe the pattern is to convert vertical lines into horizontal blocks adjacent to existing horizontal blocks of the same number?\n\nPutting this together, the pattern might be: For each number, if there's a vertical sequence (like a column of the same number), that vertical sequence is converted into a horizontal block adjacent to an existing horizontal block of the same number. The vertical blocks are removed and replaced with horizontal ones next to existing horizontal blocks.\n\nSo applying this to the test input. Let's look at the test input:\n\nRows 3-10 (assuming 0-based index) have 3s in a vertical column (column 1-5?), but wait no. Wait the test input's rows:\n\nRow 3: [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,...] So that's a horizontal block of 3s.\n\nRows 4: [0,3,3,...3,7s...] So row 4 has 3s in columns 1-5, then 7s from column 6.\n\nRow 5: 3s in columns 1-5, then 7s start at column 11.\n\nWait, maybe the vertical sequences here are the 7s. Let me check.\n\nIn row 4, the 7s start at column 6 and go to column 14 (since it's 7,7,...7). Then in rows 5-6, the 7s are at columns 11-14. Wait, no: row 5 has 7s starting at column 11. So the 7s in row 4 are a horizontal block from column 6 to 14 (assuming the length is correct), but in rows 5-6, the 7s are at columns 11-14. So there's a vertical sequence in columns 11-14, rows 5-6 (and 7?), but row 4 has a longer horizontal 7 block.\n\nWait, the test input has:\n\nRow 4: 7s from index 6 to 14 (assuming the list length is 17). Then rows 5 and 6 have 7s starting at index 11. So that's a vertical line of 7s in columns 11-14 for rows 5 and 6, but row 4 has a horizontal block. So maybe the vertical parts of 7s (rows 5-6, columns 11-14) need to be converted into a horizontal block adjacent to the existing horizontal 7s in row 4.\n\nSo the output should move those vertical 7s into a horizontal block next to the existing 7s. For example, the vertical 7s in rows 5-6, columns 11-14 would become a horizontal block in row 4, extending to the right? Or maybe left. Wait in Example 1, the 4s in row 5 (input) were shifted to the right in the output. So perhaps vertical sequences are moved to the right or left to form horizontal blocks adjacent to existing horizontal ones.\n\nIn Example 0, the vertical 5s (rows 4-7, column 3) became a horizontal block in rows 8-10, columns 2-5. So they were moved below the existing horizontal 5 block (which was in rows 8-10 already in input? Wait in the input of Example 0, the 5s are in rows 4-7 (single column) and then in rows 8-10 (horizontal). The output moves the vertical ones to the horizontal block, merging them. So the output's rows 4-6 (originally vertical) are replaced with the horizontal block from rows 8-10. Wait, maybe the vertical sequences are merged into the existing horizontal blocks of the same number, shifting them or extending them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that vertical lines are transformed into horizontal lines adjacent to other horizontal lines of the same number. For example, in Example 2, the vertical 3s in rows 3-6 column 7 are merged into the existing horizontal 3s in rows 7-12, columns 3-10, creating a longer horizontal block.\n\nIn the test input, the 7s in row 4 are a horizontal block (columns 6-14?), then rows 5 and 6 have 7s starting at column 11. So those are vertical in columns 11-14. The output should convert those vertical 7s into a horizontal block adjacent to the existing horizontal 7s in row 4. So perhaps extend the row 4's 7s to the right? Or move them into a new row below or above.\n\nWait in Example 1, the input's 4s in rows 5-7 (columns 1-3) are shifted to the right in the output to columns 4-6. So the vertical sequence (columns 1-3, rows 5-7) became a horizontal block shifted right. So maybe vertical sequences are moved to form horizontal blocks in the same rows but shifted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical blocks are moved to the nearest possible position where they can form a horizontal block adjacent to existing horizontal blocks.\n\nIn the test input's case, the existing horizontal 7s in row 4 are from column 6-14 (assuming 7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7). Then in rows 5 and 6, the 7s start at column 11. So those are vertical columns 11-14 (maybe columns 11-14 in rows 5 and 6). The vertical columns would be 11-14 for 2 rows. The output would convert those vertical 7s into a horizontal block. Since the existing 7s in row 4 end at column 14, perhaps the vertical ones are added as a horizontal block in the same row, extending towards the right. But since row 4 already has 7s up to column 14 (if the input's row 4 has 7s up to column 14), maybe there's no space. Alternatively, they could be moved to a new row. But looking at the examples, in Example 0, the vertical 5s (rows 4-7) were merged into the existing horizontal 5s in rows 8-10, but in the output, the vertical 5s are replaced by the horizontal block. Wait, in Example 0's input, rows 8-10 have 5s as a horizontal block (columns 2-5), and the vertical 5s (rows 4-7, column 3) are replaced with 0s in the output. Wait no, the output in Example 0 moves the vertical 5s into the horizontal block. Wait in the input of Example 0, the vertical 5s are in rows 4-7, column 3, and the horizontal 5s are in rows 8-10. The output removes the vertical 5s and merges them into the horizontal block, but in the output, rows 4-6 (original vertical) become the horizontal 5s. Wait, no, in the output of Example 0, the vertical 5s (rows 4-7) are replaced by a horizontal block starting at row 4. So the vertical 5s are transformed into a horizontal block in rows 4-6, columns 2-5. So the transformation is to take the vertical line and turn it into a horizontal block in the same area.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to find a different approach.\n\nLooking at all examples, the output seems to have the same numbers as the input, but their positions are adjusted such that vertical sequences become horizontal. So the pattern is to replace vertical lines (columns with the same number in consecutive rows) with horizontal lines (rows with consecutive same numbers) in the same general area, possibly adjacent to existing horizontal blocks of the same number.\n\nAnother possibility is that the transformation is to shift certain blocks horizontally to align them with others. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the input are in a kind of T-shape, and in the output, they are shifted to the right to form a solid block next to the 2s.\n\nIn the test input, there's a horizontal block of 7s in row 4 and vertical segments in rows 5-6. The output should merge those vertical segments into a horizontal block, possibly extending the existing horizontal block in row 4. But since row 4 already has 7s up to column 14 (assuming the input row 4 is [0,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0]), then columns 6-14 are 7s. The vertical segments in rows 5-6 are at columns 11-14. So to merge those, perhaps the vertical 7s in rows 5-6 (columns 11-14) become a horizontal block in row 4, but row 4 is already filled. Alternatively, they could be placed in rows 5-6 as horizontal blocks adjacent to the existing 7s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical 7s are moved to row 4, but since row 4's 7s already end at column 14, perhaps they are moved to the right. But the test input's row 4's 7s end at column 14 (index 14) and the row length is 17 (since the list has 17 elements). So columns 0-16. So in row 4, 7s are from 6 to 14. The vertical 7s in rows 5-6 are at columns 11-14. So maybe those are moved to form horizontal blocks in rows 5-6, columns 6-14 (but overlapping with existing 0s). Wait, but in the input's rows 5 and 6, columns 6-10 are 0s. So perhaps the vertical 7s in columns 11-14 (rows 5-6) are moved to columns 6-10, forming horizontal 7s in rows 5-6. That would align them with the existing 7s in row 4.\n\nLooking at Example 1 again, the 4s in the input are shifted to the right to align with the 2s. So the movement is to the right. So maybe in the test input, the vertical 7s in columns 11-14 (rows 5-6) are shifted left to columns 6-9, extending the existing horizontal 7s in row 4 down into rows 5-6. So rows 5-6 would have 7s from columns 6-9, forming a horizontal block adjacent to the existing one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical 7s are moved to the same row as the existing horizontal 7s (row 4), but since row 4's 7s are already there, maybe they're moved to form a larger horizontal block. But the vertical 7s are in rows 5-6, which are below row 4. So maybe they are shifted up into row 4, but that would overwrite existing 3s. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical 7s in rows 5-6 are transformed into a horizontal block in rows 5-6, but where? For example, in rows 5-6, columns 6-10 (since those are 0s in the input). So the 7s from columns 11-14 (vertical) would be moved left to columns 6-9 in the same rows, creating horizontal 7s there. This would make the output have a continuous block of 7s from row 4 (columns 6-14), rows 5-6 (columns 6-9), but that might not align. Alternatively, maybe they are moved to the end of the existing 7s. Like, row 4's 7s go up to column 14, so in rows 5-6, the 7s could start at column 6 and extend to column 14, filling in the 0s between 6 and 10. But in the input's rows 5-6, columns 6-10 are 0s, so they could be filled with 7s, making the 7s in rows 5-6 start from column 6 (aligned with row 4) and extend to column 14. That way, the vertical 7s in columns 11-14 (rows 5-6) would become part of a horizontal block from 6-14 in rows 5-6.\n\nIf that's the case, then the output for the test input would have:\n\nRow 4: 3s in 1-5, then 7s from 6-14.\n\nRow 5: 3s in 1-5, then 7s from 6-14 (since the input's row 5 has 7s starting at 11, but transformed into a full block from 6-14).\n\nSimilarly, row 6 would have 7s from 6-14.\n\nBut the original input's row 5 and 6 have 0s between columns 6-10. So in the output, those would become 7s, making the 7s in rows 4-6 as a larger horizontal block.\n\nLooking at the examples, in Example 0, the vertical 5s (rows 4-7, column 3) are transformed into a horizontal block in rows 4-6, columns 2-5, merging with the existing horizontal 5s in rows 8-10. Wait, but in the output of Example 0, the original horizontal 5s in rows 8-10 are still present. No, wait the output of Example 0's rows 4-6 have the horizontal 5s, and rows 8-10 are removed. Wait the input's rows 8-10 have horizontal 5s, but the output's rows 4-6 have horizontal 5s. So perhaps the vertical 5s are replaced by a horizontal block, and the existing horizontal block is removed. That doesn't make sense. Wait the output of Example 0 shows that the vertical 5s (rows 4-7) are replaced by a horizontal block starting at row 4, and the existing horizontal block in rows 8-10 is gone. So the transformation is moving the vertical block into a horizontal position, and removing the original horizontal block.\n\nHmm. So maybe the pattern is: for each number, if there's a vertical sequence (columns with consecutive same numbers), they are transformed into a horizontal block in the same rows where the vertical started, and any existing horizontal blocks of the same number are removed or replaced.\n\nIn the test input, the vertical 7s in rows 5-6 (columns 11-14) would be transformed into a horizontal block in rows 5-6, columns 6-14. So rows 5 and 6 would have 7s from 6 to 14. The original vertical 7s in columns 11-14 would be replaced by this horizontal block. Additionally, the existing horizontal 7s in row 4 (columns 6-14) would remain. So the output would have 7s in rows 4-6, columns 6-14, forming a larger block.\n\nBut looking at Example 1 again, the 4s are shifted to the right to align with the 2s. So the movement is towards the right. In the test input, maybe the vertical 7s are moved left to merge with the existing horizontal 7s. So the vertical 7s in columns 11-14 (rows 5-6) would become part of the existing horizontal block in row 4 by extending into rows 5-6, columns 6-14. That way, the 7s would form a larger block covering rows 4-6, columns 6-14.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nOriginal rows 4-6:\n\nRow 4: [0,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,0,0]\n\nAfter transformation, rows 5 and 6 would have 7s from columns 6-14. So:\n\nRow 5: [0,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0]\n\nThis way, the vertical 7s in columns 11-14 (rows 5-6) become part of the horizontal block starting at column 6 in their respective rows, merging with the existing 7s in row 4 to form a larger 7 block spanning rows 4-6, columns 6-14.\n\nBut looking at Example 2, the vertical 3s (rows 3-6, column 7) are merged into the existing horizontal 3s in rows 7-12. Wait, in Example 2's input, there's a horizontal block of 3s in rows 7-12, columns 3-10. The vertical 3s in rows 3-6, column 7 are transformed into horizontal 3s in rows 3-6, columns 3-10. So the vertical line becomes part of the horizontal block above the existing one.\n\nSimilarly, in the test input, the vertical 7s (rows 5-6, columns 11-14) would become part of the horizontal block in row 4, extending down into rows 5-6.\n\nSo, applying this, the output for the test input would have rows 4-6 with 7s from column 6 to 14.\n\nNow, what about the 3s? In the test input, the 3s are in rows 3-10, columns 1-5. There's no vertical sequence of 3s except in their own rows. Since each row has a horizontal block of 3s, there's no vertical line to convert, so they remain.\n\nSo the transformed test input's rows would be:\n\nRow 3: [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,...] remains the same.\n\nRow 4: [0,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0] (same as input).\n\nRow 5: [0,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0].\n\nRow 6: [0,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0].\n\nRows 7-10: [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,...] become [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,...] (since the vertical 3s are already horizontal blocks, but rows 7-10 in the test input have 3s in columns 1-5 and zeros elsewhere. Wait, but in the test input, rows 7-10 have 3s in columns 1-5. Are there any vertical sequences here? Each of these rows has a horizontal block of 3s, so no vertical lines. So they remain as is.\n\nThe vertical 7s in rows 5-6, columns 11-14 are transformed into horizontal blocks in rows 5-6, columns 6-14. So the 0s in columns 6-10 of rows 5-6 become 7s, merging with the existing 7s in columns 11-14.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nRows 0-2: all zeros.\n\nRow 3: [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: same as row 7.\n\nRow 9: same as row 7.\n\nRow 10: same as row 7.\n\nRow 11: all zeros.\n\nSo the final output would have the 7s extended horizontally in rows 4-6, columns 6-14, merging the vertical segments into horizontal ones.\n\nLet me check the training examples again to see if this aligns.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's 4s in rows 5-7 (columns 1-3) are moved to columns 4-6 in the output, forming horizontal blocks adjacent to the existing 2s. So the vertical blocks are shifted to the right. Similarly, in the test input, the vertical 7s are shifted left to columns 6-14 in their rows, aligning with the existing horizontal 7s in row 4.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the pattern is to convert vertical sequences into horizontal blocks adjacent to existing horizontal blocks of the same number, shifting them left or right to merge.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the test input, the vertical 7s in rows 5-6, columns 11-14 become horizontal in those rows, extending from column 6 to 14, merging with the existing 7s in row 4.",
