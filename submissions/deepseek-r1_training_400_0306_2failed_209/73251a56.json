        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input list is transformed into an output list. The key is to see how the input changes to become the output.\n\nFirst, let's compare Example 0's input and output. Let's take the first input list in Example 0:\n\nINPUT: \n[1, 6, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]\n\nOUTPUT: \nSame as input. Hmm, wait, that's the same. So maybe the first example's input is already the output. But looking at other examples, maybe that's not the case. Wait, no\u2014looking at Example 0, the input and output are the same for the first list, but others in Example 0 have different inputs and outputs.\n\nWait, looking closer: In Example 0's INPUT, the first array is the same as the OUTPUT. But other entries in the same example's input have some zeros that change. For instance, the fourth input in Example 0 is:\n\n[2, 1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n[2, 1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nSo here, the zeros in positions 11,12,13 (values 0,0,0) are replaced with 1s. So the pattern seems to replace sequences of zeros with the previous non-zero number. Wait, but in this case, before the zeros is a 1. So the zeros are replaced by 1s. Let's check another example. In Example 0's fifth input:\n\nINPUT: [2, 1, 6, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\nOUTPUT: [2, 1, 6, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\nHere, the zeros (at positions 11-13) are replaced with 6 and 1s. Wait, in the input, the sequence is 0,0,0. The output here becomes 6,1,1. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe the replacement is different. Wait the input is [2,1,6,6,6,1,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,1,...]. The output is [2,1,6,6,6,1,6,6,6,6,6,6,1,1,1,...]. So the first zero is replaced by 6 (the previous non-zero number was 6?), then the next two zeros become 1. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let's track the previous number before the zeros.\n\nIn the input, the element before the zeros is 6 (position 10 is 6). So the zeros are after 6, then in output, they are replaced with 6,1,1. Wait, but that's not consistent. Alternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced by the next non-zero number. After the zeros in the input, the next non-zero is 1 (position 14). So maybe zeros are replaced by the next non-zero number. But in the output for this case, the first zero becomes 6, then 1s. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the zeros are replaced by the previous non-zero number. But in that case, the previous non-zero is 6, so all zeros should become 6. But here, they become 6,1,1. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, let's check another example. Let's take Example 1's first input:\n\nINPUT: [6,5,6,6,7,7,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,1]\n\nOUTPUT is same as input. So no change. Another input in Example 1:\n\nFourth input line in Example 1's INPUT:\n\n[6,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1]\n\nOUTPUT becomes [6,5,5,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1]. So the three zeros are replaced with 6,5,5. Wait, how? The numbers before the zeros are 5,5,0,0,0. So previous non-zero is 5. The next non-zero after zeros is 5 (the fifth element after the zeros starts at position 6, which is 5). So maybe it's a mix of previous and next? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros are being replaced by the number that follows the sequence of zeros. Let's see. In Example 1's fourth input, the zeros are followed by 5s. But in the output, the zeros are replaced with 6,5,5. Wait, the element before the zeros is 5 (third position is 5, then zeros). The next elements after zeros are 5 (position 6). So why 6 in the first replacement? Maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nLooking at Example 0's fifth input again: the zeros are replaced with 6,1,1. The previous non-zero before the zeros is 6 (position 10:6), and the next non-zero after zeros is 1 (position 14:1). So the zeros are in positions 11-13. The output replaces them with 6,1,1. So first zero becomes previous (6), and the rest become the next (1). Maybe the first zero is filled with the previous non-zero, and the subsequent zeros with the next non-zero. So if there's a block of zeros, the first zero is replaced with the previous non-zero, the rest with the next non-zero. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example 0's fourth input, the zeros are replaced by 1s. The previous non-zero is 1 (position 10:1), and the next is 1 (position 14:1). So all zeros become 1. That fits.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input: previous is 6 (position 10:6), next is 1 (position 14:1). So first zero becomes 6, next two become 1. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1's fourth input: zeros are between 5 and 5. The previous is 5, next is 5. So all zeros should become 5. But in the output, the zeros are replaced with 6,5,5. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nWait in Example 1's fourth input line:\n\nInput is [6,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1]\n\nThe output is [6,5,5,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1]\n\nSo the three zeros (positions 3-5) are replaced with 6,5,5. The previous non-zero is 5 (position 2:5), next non-zero is 5 (position 6:5). But according to the previous hypothesis, first zero should be previous (5) and the rest next (5). So all zeros become 5. But output has 6,5,5. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm, maybe there's another pattern. Let's think differently. Maybe the zeros are replaced by the first non-zero number after the zeros. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input, the zeros are followed by 1. So all zeros become 1. But in output, first zero is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced by the first non-zero number before them. But in Example 0's fifth input, the first zero is preceded by 6, so all zeros become 6. But the output has 6,1,1. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the zeros are being replaced with the number that's part of a sequence. For example, in Example 0, the numbers 1-6 are cycling. Maybe the zeros are replaced by the next number in a cycle. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are part of a run-length encoding or some increment pattern. Looking at the first example where zeros are replaced, like in Example 0's fourth input:\n\nInput has [2,1,6,6,1,6,6,6,6,6,1,0,0,0,1,1,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nOutput replaces 0s with 1s. So the previous number before 0s is 1, and the next is 1. So replacing with 1 makes sense. But in the fifth input of Example 0, the 0s are between 6 and 1, so perhaps the first 0 is replaced with 6 and the rest with 1. That might be the case.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the zeros are replaced by the value that is the sum of the previous and next numbers. But in Example 0's fourth input, previous is 1, next is 1. 1+1=2, but output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced by the previous non-zero value if the next non-zero is the same as the previous. For instance, in Example 0's fourth input, the zeros are between 1 and 1. So all zeros become 1. But in the fifth input, the zeros are between 6 and 1, so first zero becomes 6, the rest become 1. Maybe that's the pattern: for a run of zeros, replace them by the previous non-zero value until the middle of the run, and then by the next non-zero value. Or perhaps split the run into two halves: first half take previous, second half take next. But that might not explain all cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first occurrence of a zero is replaced by the previous non-zero, and subsequent zeros are replaced by the next non-zero. Let's test this:\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input, zeros at positions 11-13: the first zero becomes previous (6), then next zeros become next (1). So output is 6,1,1. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1's fourth input, zeros are at positions 3-5. The previous non-zero is 5 (position 2), next non-zero is 5 (position 6). So according to this rule, the first zero becomes 5, and the rest become 5. But the output is 6,5,5. So that doesn't fit. Wait, but the output here is [6,5,5,6,5,5,5,5, ...]. So positions 3-5 in input are zeros. Output is 6,5,5. That's conflicting. Wait the previous non-zero before the zeros is 5 (position 2:5), next non-zero is 5 (position 6:5). So according to the rule, all zeros should be 5. But output has 6 as first replacement.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a different logic here. Looking at Example 1's fourth input line again. The input is:\n\n[6,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[6,5,5,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1]\n\nSo the zeros (positions 3-5) become 6,5,5. How does that happen? Let's see the numbers before the zeros: 5,5,0,0,0. The previous non-zero is 5. The next non-zero is 5 (position 6). But in the output, the first zero is replaced with 6. Where does 6 come from? Maybe looking at the entire array structure. Wait, the array seems to be cyclical. For example, in Example 0, the numbers cycle 1-6. In Example 1, they cycle 1-7. Example 2 cycles 1-8. The test input cycles up to 9. So maybe the numbers are part of a circular sequence.\n\nIf that's the case, then maybe the zeros are replaced with the next number in the cycle. For example, in Example 0's input, the cycle is 1-6. If a zero follows a 6, the next number would be 1. So perhaps zeros are replaced by incrementing the previous number (mod the cycle length). Let's test.\n\nIn Example 0's fourth input, the zeros follow a 1. So 1+1=2. But in output, they are replaced with 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are filled with the same value as the previous non-zero. But in Example 1's fourth input, that would mean 5s, but the output has 6. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are filled based on some other pattern in the array, such as the position in the list. But the lists vary in length, but all training examples have 21 elements. So perhaps the index is important. But I don't see how.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's fourth input again, after replacing zeros with 6,5,5. The previous non-zero is 5, but the output starts with 6. Hmm, maybe the 6 comes from the first element of the array. But the first element is 6. But why would that influence the replacement?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement depends on some pattern in the entire array. For example, the first element is the starting number, and each subsequent number increases by 1 modulo the maximum number. But the arrays in the examples don't seem to follow a straightforward increment. For example, in Example 0's first input array: [1,6,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]. It goes 1,6,1,1,2,2,3, etc. So perhaps this is a spiral or some other pattern.\n\nBut maybe the key is that in the input arrays, whenever there is a zero, it's replaced by a non-zero number in the output. The way to find the replacement is to look for the previous and next non-zero numbers around the zero run and fill accordingly.\n\nWait, in Example 1's fourth input, the zeros are at positions 3,4,5. The numbers before are [6,5,5], and after are [5,5,6,6...]. So the zeros are between two 5s. But the output replaces them with 6,5,5. Why 6 here? That's confusing. Maybe there's a different rule here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros are replaced by the number that appears earlier in the sequence. For example, in the first array of Example 0, the zeros are replaced by 1, which is the previous number. But in Example 1's fourth input, the zeros are replaced with 6,5,5. The 6 might come from the first element of the array. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced with the value of the first element of the array. In Example 0's first input, first element is 1. In the fourth input, the first element is 2, and the zeros are replaced with 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a pattern in the structure of the arrays. For example, each array seems to be a sequence that builds up in counts. For instance, in Example 0's first input: 1 appears once, then 6 appears once, then 1 appears twice, 2 twice, etc. So maybe the numbers are arranged in runs where each run increases the count by 1. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the arrays are part of a larger structure like a pyramid or spiral, and the zeros indicate missing numbers that need to be filled in a certain way. But without seeing the entire structure, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother approach: look at all examples and see what's common in how zeros are replaced.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- In the fourth input, three zeros are replaced by 1s. The previous number is 1, next is 1.\n- Fifth input: three zeros replaced by 6,1,1. Previous is 6, next is 1.\n- Sixth input: no zeros.\n- Seventh input: three zeros replaced by 6s. Previous is 0 (but no, previous is 1?), wait the input is [3,2,1,6,6,6,6,1,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,1,1,1,1,1]. So the zeros are after 1. Then replaced by 6,6,6. Wait, but output is [3,2,1,6,6,6,6,1,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,1,1,1,1,1]. So three zeros become 6s. But previous non-zero is 1, next is 6. So how does that fit?\n\nThis is conflicting. The previous non-zero is 1, next is 6. The zeros are replaced by 6. So perhaps when the previous and next are different, the zeros are replaced by the next non-zero. But in Example 0's fifth input, previous is 6 and next is 1, but the first zero becomes 6 and the rest become 1. So maybe the first zero is replaced by the previous, and the rest by the next.\n\nBut in the seventh input of Example 0, three zeros between 1 and 6 become all 6. So according to the previous rule, the first zero should be 1 (previous), but here all are 6. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing a different pattern. Maybe the replacement is based on the previous non-zero number, and the next non-zero number, and the zeros are filled with the next number in the cycle. For example, if previous is 1, next is 6 (as in Example 0's fifth input), then the zeros are filled as 6, then 1, then 1. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are filled with the maximum of previous and next. In Example 0's fifth input, previous is 6, next is 1. Max is 6. But the output is 6,1,1. Only the first zero is max. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are filled with the previous number for the first half and next for the second. For three zeros, first two are previous, last is next. But in Example 0's fifth input, three zeros, first is 6 (previous), next two 1 (next). But if three zeros, split as 1 and 2, then first 1.5 would be previous, but that's not practical. Alternatively, for an odd number of zeros, the middle one is the next.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are filled with the previous number until the position where the next number starts. For example, in a run of zeros, the first part is previous, then the next part is next. But how to split?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros are replaced by the number that is one more than the previous, modulo the cycle. For example, if the previous is 6, then zeros become 1. But in Example 0's fifth input, previous is 6, zeros become 6,1,1. That doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find another approach. Maybe the zeros are replaced by the same number that appears later in the array. Looking at Example 0's fifth input: after the zeros, there's a 1. So zeros are replaced with 6,1,1. The first 6 could be the previous, and the next 1s are from after. But why the first zero is 6 and the rest are 1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is based on the position in the array. For example, certain indices have a specific value. But the arrays vary in their elements, so that's unlikely.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's fourth input:\n\nInput: [6,5,4,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5]\n\nWait, no. Let me check Example 2's fourth input. Example 2's fourth input is:\n\n[6,5,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,6,6,6]\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, looking at the test input provided. The test input has zeros in various places, and the goal is to replace them following the same pattern as the training examples.\n\nAnother observation: In the outputs of all training examples, there are no zeros. All zeros in the input are replaced by some numbers in the output. So the transformation is to replace zeros with numbers.\n\nLooking at Example 0's fifth input:\n\nInput: [2,1,6,6,6,1,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,2,2]\n\nOutput: [2,1,6,6,6,1,6,6,6,6,6,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2]\n\nSo the three zeros (positions 11-13) are replaced with 6,1,1. How does that make sense? The previous non-zero is 6 (position 10:6), next is 1 (position 14:1). So first zero is replaced with 6, next two with 1. So maybe the rule is that for a run of zeros, the first zero is replaced with the previous non-zero, and the rest with the next non-zero.\n\nIn Example 0's seventh input:\n\nInput: [3,2,1,6,6,6,6,1,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nOutput: [3,2,1,6,6,6,6,1,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nThe three zeros (positions 8-10) are replaced with 6. Previous non-zero is 1 (position 7:1), next non-zero is 6 (position 11:6). According to the rule, first zero should be 1, then next two 6. But the output has 6,6,6. So this contradicts the previous hypothesis.\n\nHmm, this is puzzling. Let's try to find another pattern. Let's look for the positions where zeros are replaced and see if there's a relation between the input and output in terms of the surrounding numbers.\n\nIn Example 0's seventh input, the zeros are between 1 and 6. The output replaces them with 6. So maybe when the previous and next are different, all zeros are replaced with the next non-zero.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input, previous is 6, next is 1. All zeros are replaced with 6 and then 1s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is to fill the zeros with the next non-zero number, regardless of the previous. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input, next non-zero is 1. So all zeros become 1. But output has 6,1,1. So that's not the case.\n\nIn Example 0's seventh input, next non-zero is 6. So zeros become 6. Which fits.\n\nIn Example 1's fourth input, next non-zero is 5. So zeros become 5. But output has 6,5,5. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in Example 1's fourth input, the zeros are followed by 5s. But the output has 6 as the first replacement. So perhaps there's a different logic here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are filled with the number that comes after the next non-zero in the cycle. For example, if the next non-zero is 5, then next is 6. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the entire array structure, perhaps the zeros are in positions that form a certain pattern when replaced. For example, maybe the array is constructed in a spiral pattern where each layer increments the number. But I need to visualize the array as a 2D structure. Let's assume the array is arranged in a square spiral. Since each array has 21 elements, which is 3*7, maybe arranged as a 3x7 grid. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the arrays are sequences where each number represents a direction change in a spiral, and zeros indicate steps where the direction is maintained, so replaced with the current direction number. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother angle: The training examples show that the output often has runs of the same number increasing in length. For example, in Example 0's first input, the output has runs like 1, then 6, then 1,1, then 2,2, etc. This suggests that the numbers are part of a sequence where each number's run increases by one each time. So perhaps the zeros in the input are placeholders for missing numbers in these runs, and the transformation fills them in to maintain the increasing run lengths.\n\nBut in Example 0's fifth input, the output has a run of 6 (length 6), then 1s (length 5). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each number is followed by a run of itself of increasing length, and zeros are inserted when the run is interrupted. So replacing zeros would complete the run.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's compare the input and output for each example where zeros are present.\n\nTaking Example 0's fourth input again:\n\nInput: [2,1,6,6,1,6,6,6,6,6,1,0,0,0,1,1,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nOutput: [2,1,6,6,1,6,6,6,6,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nHere, the zeros are replaced by 1s. The previous number is 1, next is 1. So all zeros become 1.\n\nExample 0's fifth input:\n\nInput: [2,1,6,6,6,1,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,2,2]\n\nOutput: [2,1,6,6,6,1,6,6,6,6,6,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2]\n\nPrevious number is 6, next is 1. Zeros become 6,1,1.\n\nExample 0's seventh input:\n\nInput: [3,2,1,6,6,6,6,1,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nOutput: [3,2,1,6,6,6,6,1,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nPrevious is 1, next is 6. Zeros become 6,6,6.\n\nExample 1's fourth input:\n\nInput: [6,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1]\n\nOutput: [6,5,5,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1]\n\nPrevious is 5, next is 5. Zeros become 6,5,5. Why 6 here?\n\nThis seems inconsistent. But wait, maybe the previous number before the entire run is considered. For Example 1's fourth input, the run starts after 5,5. Maybe the previous number is 5, but the next element after the zeros is 5 again. So why the first zero is 6?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cycle of numbers, and the zeros are filled with the next number in the cycle. For Example 0, numbers cycle 1-6. So after 6 comes 1. Example 1 cycles 1-7, so after 7 comes 1. Example 2 cycles 1-8. The test input cycles up to 9.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input, previous number is 6 (which is the end of the cycle), so next is 1. So replacing zeros with 6, then 1s. Maybe the first zero is the previous number, the rest are next number in the cycle. So for three zeros: 6,1,1.\n\nIn Example 0's seventh input, previous number is 1, next in cycle is 2. But zeros are replaced with 6. That doesn't fit.\n\nExample 1's fourth input, previous number is 5, next in cycle is 6. So first zero becomes 6, then next zeros become 5 (but next in cycle would be 6, then 7). But output has 6,5,5. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the cycle is not the key here.\n\nAnother observation: In the training examples, when there's a run of zeros, the replacement numbers are either the same as the previous non-zero, the next non-zero, or a combination. But how to determine which?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros are replaced by the previous number if the next number is the same as the previous. Otherwise, replaced by the next number.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's fourth input: previous is 1, next is 1. So all zeros become 1.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input: previous is 6, next is 1 (different). So first zero becomes 6, rest become 1.\n\nIn Example 0's seventh input: previous is 1, next is 6. So all zeros become 6.\n\nIn Example 1's fourth input: previous is 5, next is 5. So all zeros become 5. But the output has 6,5,5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced with the number that appears most frequently in the surrounding area. But that would require analyzing the entire array, which is time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced with the number that is the result of some mathematical operation involving their position. For example, index modulo the maximum number in the array.\n\nBut in Example 1's fourth input, the first zero is at position 3. Max number is 7. 3 mod 7 is 3. But the replacement is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: look for the test input and try to see what replacements are needed.\n\nThe test input has several zeros. For example, in the first line after the test input:\n\n[4,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]\n\nThis seems to be the first line, which matches the output (since in previous examples, the first line of input is the same as output). So maybe the first line of the test input is the same as the output.\n\nThe second line of the test input is:\n\n[3,4,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,0,0,6,7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9]\n\nOutput would replace the zeros (positions 10 and 11) with 5 and 6? Or according to previous patterns, the previous non-zero is 5, next is 6. So for two zeros: first replaced with 5, second with 6. But in Example 0's fifth input, three zeros are replaced with 6,1,1. So maybe the first zero is previous, the rest are next.\n\nIn this case, two zeros: first becomes 5, second becomes 6. So the output would be [3,4,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,6,6,7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9]. But looking at the training examples, for example in Example 2's third input, which has two zeros replaced:\n\nInput: [5,4,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,7,7,0,0,8,8,8]\n\nOutput: [5,4,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,8,8,8]\n\nThe two zeros are replaced with 7,7. The previous non-zero is 7, next is 8. So according to the previous rule, the first zero becomes 7, second becomes 8. But the output is 7,7. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, when previous and next are different, replace all zeros with next. So in Example 2's third input, zeros are between 7 and 8. So replace with 8. But output uses 7. Hmm.\n\nThis suggests that when previous and next are different, the zeros are replaced with the previous number. But in Example 0's seventh input, zeros between 1 and 6 are replaced with 6, which is next. So this is conflicting.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe the pattern is that zeros are replaced with the previous non-zero number, regardless of what's next. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's fourth input: zeros replaced with 1 (previous is 1).\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input: previous is 6, replaced with 6,1,1. First zero is 6, others are 1. So not consistent.\n\nIn Example 0's seventh input: previous is 1, but replaced with 6. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced with the next non-zero number.\n\nIn Example 0's fourth input: next is 1, replaced with 1.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input: next is 1, replaced with 1s. But first zero is 6. Contradicts.\n\nIn Example 0's seventh input: next is 6, replaced with 6.\n\nExample 1's fourth input: next is 5, but first zero is 6.\n\nHmm. This is not working.\n\nPerhaps there's another approach. Maybe the replacement depends on the position of the zero within the array. For example, in Example 0's fifth input, the zeros are at positions 11-13. The array has 21 elements, which could be arranged in a 3x7 grid. If we imagine it as a spiral, the zeros might be in certain positions that determine their replacement.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement could be based on the number of occurrences of certain numbers before the zeros. But this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples where zeros are replaced with the next non-zero number, especially when the previous and next are different.\n\nIn the test input's second line:\n\n[3,4,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,0,0,6,7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9]\n\nThe two zeros are between 5 and 6. Previous is 5, next is 6. So according to some examples, maybe replace all zeros with 6. But in Example 0's fifth input, when previous is 6 and next is 1, zeros are replaced with 6,1,1. So maybe first zero is previous, rest are next. So here, two zeros would become 5,6. But in Example 2's third input, two zeros between 7 and 8 are replaced with 7,7. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the test input's case, the zeros are replaced with 5,5. But the next non-zero is 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 1's fourth input where zeros are between 5s but replaced with 6,5,5. Maybe the first zero is replaced with the previous number plus 1 (mod the cycle). For Example 1, the cycle is up to 7. 5+1=6. So first zero becomes 6, others become 5. Which fits that example. Let's check others.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input: previous is 6. 6+1=7, but the cycle is up to 6, so 7 mod 6 =1. So first zero becomes 1? But output is 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, previous number plus 1. For Example 1's fourth input, previous is 5, next is 5. 5+1=6. So first zero becomes 6, others 5. Which matches.\n\nIn Example 0's seventh input: previous is 1. 1+1=2. Next non-zero is 6. But the zeros are replaced with 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, but this could be a possible pattern for some cases. For example, when the zeros are between the same numbers, the first zero is previous+1, others are previous. So for Example 1's fourth input:\n\nPrevious is 5, zeros between 5s. So first zero becomes 6, others 5. Which matches.\n\nIn Example 0's fourth input: zeros between 1s. Previous is 1. So first zero becomes 2, others 1. But output is 1s. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this doesn't work for all cases.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's fourth input, the zeros are replaced with 6,5,5. 6 is the first element of the array. Maybe the replacement is based on the first element. But in Example 0's fifth input, the first element is 2. Zeros are replaced with 6 and 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the complexity, I think the best approach is to assume that zeros are replaced with the previous non-zero number for the first zero and the next non-zero for the remaining. But in some cases, when the next non-zero is different, all zeros are replaced with the next non-zero. For example, in Example 0's seventh input, all zeros become 6 (next non-zero).\n\nBut since this is inconsistent, I'll have to look for another pattern.\n\nAnother possible pattern: when zeros are between two different numbers, all zeros are replaced with the next non-zero number. When between the same, replaced with the same.\n\nExample 0's fifth input: between 6 and 1, all zeros become 1. But output is 6,1,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample 0's seventh input: between 1 and 6, zeros become 6. Fits.\n\nExample 1's fourth input: between 5 and 5, zeros become 5. But output has 6,5,5. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given that time is limited, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that zeros are replaced with the next non-zero number. \n\nFor the test input's second line:\n\n[3,4,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,0,0,6,7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9]\n\nThe zeros are followed by 6. So replace with 6,6. So the output line becomes [3,4,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,...].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, like Example 2's third input:\n\nInput: [5,4,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,7,7,0,0,8,8,8]\n\nOutput: [5,4,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,8,8,8]\n\nThe zeros are between 7 and 8. The output replaces them with 7,7. So previous non-zero is 7, next is 8. So replaced with previous.\n\nIn the test input's case, zeros are between 5 and 6. So replaced with 5 or 6?\n\nBut according to Example 2's third input, replaced with previous (7). So perhaps the zeros are replaced with the previous non-zero.\n\nIn that case, for the test input's second line, the zeros between 5 and 6 would become 5,5. So the output line would be [3,4,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9].\n\nLooking at Example 1's fourth input, which had zeros between 5 and 5, but output replaced with 6,5,5. So that contradicts.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the best approach is to replace all zeros with the next non-zero number. So in the test input's second line, zeros become 6,6. But in Example 2's third input, zeros between 7 and 8 are replaced with 7, which is previous. So this is conflicting.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps the correct pattern is that zeros are replaced with the previous non-zero number. Let's try that.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input: zeros after 6, replaced with 6,6,6. But the output has 6,1,1. So this is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that zeros are replaced with the next non-zero number. In Example 0's fifth input, next is 1. So zeros become 1,1,1. But output has 6,1,1. So again conflicting.\n\nGiven that I can't find a consistent pattern, but noticing that in many cases, when the zeros are between two different numbers, they are replaced with the next non-zero. For example, in Example 0's seventh input, zeros between 1 and 6 become 6. In Example 0's fifth input, the zeros between 6 and 1 become 1. But the output for that case starts with 6. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros are replaced with the previous non-zero number, but when the previous is part of a run, the run is extended. For example, if there's a run of a number followed by zeros, the zeros are filled with that number. But when the run is interrupted, it's filled with the next number.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the assumption that zeros are replaced with the next non-zero number. For the test input, I'll replace each zero with the next non-zero number in the array.\n\nSo let's process the test input line by line.\n\nFirst line: [4,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,1,1,2,2,3,3,4] \u2014 no zeros, so output is same.\n\nSecond line: [3,4,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,0,0,6,7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9]\n\nZeros at positions 10 and 11. The next non-zero is 6. So replace both zeros with 6. Output becomes [3,4,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,...].\n\nThird line: [4,3,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,0,0,5,5,6,6,6,6,7,7,7]\n\nZeros at positions 10,11. Next non-zero is 5. Replace with 5,5. Output: [4,3,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,7,7,7].\n\nFourth line: [4,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,0,0,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6]\n\nZeros at positions 10,11. Next non-zero is 4. Replace with 4,4. Output: [4,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,5,...].\n\nFifth line: [5,4,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nZeros at positions 10,11. Next non-zero is 4. Replace with 4,4. Output: [5,4,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,...].\n\nSixth line: [5,4,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5]\n\nZeros at positions 10,11. Next non-zero is 4. Replace with 4,4. Output: [5,4,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5].\n\nSeventh line: [6,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] \u2014 no zeros, output same.\n\nEighth line: [6,5,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4] \u2014 no zeros.\n\nNinth line: [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4]\n\nZeros at positions 0-4. The next non-zero after zeros is 3 (position 5). So replace all zeros with 3. Output becomes [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4].\n\nTenth line: [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4]\n\nZeros at 0-4. Next non-zero is 3 (position 5). Replace zeros with 3.

So replace zeros with 3. \n\nFor positions 15-19: next non-zero is 3 (position 20). Replace zeros with 3. \n\nOutput: [1,7,6,5,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nSeventeenth line: [2,8,6,5,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nSimilar to previous line. Replace zeros with 3. Output: [2,8,6,5,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nEighteenth line: [2,8,6,5,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3]\n\nZeros at positions 4-8. Next non-zero is 3 (position 9). Replace with 3. Output: [2,8,6,5,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3].\n\nNineteenth line: [3,8,7,6,5,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,3,3]\n\nZeros at positions 12-16. Next non-zero is 3 (position 17). Replace with 3. Output: [3,8,7,6,5,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3].\n\nTwentieth line: [3,9,7,6,5,5,4,4,4,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,4,3]\n\nZeros at 12-16. Next non-zero is 3 (position 17). Replace with 3. Output: [3,9,7,6,5,5,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3].\n\nTwenty-first line: [4,9,7,6,5,5,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4] \u2014 no zeros.\n\nBut this approach may not align with the training examples. For instance, in Example 1's fourth input, where zeros are replaced with 6,5,5. But according to this method, all would be replaced with 5. This inconsistency makes me doubt, but given time constraints, I'll proceed with this pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern between the input and output lists in the training examples. Let me start by looking at the first example. \n\nIn Example 0, the input and output arrays look very similar, but there are some differences. For instance, looking at the fourth input array:\n\nInput: [2, 1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\nOutput: [2, 1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nI notice that the zeros in the input (positions 11-13) are replaced by ones in the output. Similarly, in the next input array of Example 0:\n\nInput: [2, 1, 6, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\nOutput: [2, 1, 6, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\nHere, the zeros at positions 11-13 become 6, 1, 1. Wait, no, the output replaces the three zeros with 6 and two ones? Wait, looking again: the input has [...,6,6,6,0,0,0,1,1,...] and the output has [...,6,6,6,6,6,6,1,1,...]. Wait, maybe I need to check more examples.\n\nLooking at another part of Example 0: The fifth input array in the list for Example 0 has a zero, which in the output becomes a 6. Wait, perhaps the pattern is replacing sequences of zeros with the next number in a sequence. Alternatively, maybe zeros are being replaced by the previous non-zero number plus one. Or perhaps there's a different rule.\n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output arrays for each example. Let's take the first example's first input and output. The input and output are the same, so maybe the transformation doesn't apply there. Wait, in Example 0, the first input is [1,6,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,1,1,2,2,3,3,4], and the output is the same. So perhaps in some cases, there's no change. Then, looking at other inputs where there are zeros. For instance, in the fourth input of Example 0:\n\nInput: [2, 1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\nOutput: [2, 1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nSo the zeros are replaced by 1s. But how? Let's check the surrounding numbers. The number before the zeros is 1, then zeros, then after zeros is 1 again. So maybe the zeros are replaced by the previous non-zero number plus 1 modulo some value? Wait, 1+1=2, but here they are replaced by 1s. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced by the next non-zero number. After the zeros in the input is 1. But the output replaces the zeros with 1s. So maybe the zeros are filled with the next number. Wait, but the next number after zeros is 1. So replacing zeros with the next number. Let's check another example.\n\nIn Example 1's first input:\n\nInput: [6,5,6,6,7,7,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,1]\nOutput is the same as input. So no zeros here, so no changes.\n\nLooking at Example 1's third input:\n\nInput: [6,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1]\nOutput: [6,5,5,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1]\n\nHere, the zeros (positions 3-5) are replaced with 6,5,5. Wait, but how? The number before the zeros is 5 (element 2), and the next non-zero after the zeros is 5 (element 6). So the zeros are filled with the previous number (5) and the next number (5), but how? Let's see: the input has 5,5,0,0,0,5. The output replaces the zeros with 6,5,5. Wait, that's not matching. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the zeros are replaced with the previous number plus 1 modulo some maximum. Let's check. The previous number is 5 (element 2). Then 5+1=6. So the first zero becomes 6, then the next zeros become 5,5. That seems inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced in a way that they increment starting from the previous number plus 1. For example, 5 -> 6, then 5,5. Hmm, but that doesn't fit a clear pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input:\n\nInput array 3: [5,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,5,5,0,0,4,5,5,5,0,0,7,7,7]\nOutput: [5,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7]\n\nHere, the zeros (positions 10-11) are replaced with 5,5. The previous number is 5 (element 9), so replacing zeros with 5. Then the next zeros (positions 16-17) in the input become 6,6. The previous number before those zeros is 5 (element 15), so 5+1=6. So maybe zeros are replaced with the previous non-zero number plus 1? Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 0's fourth input:\n\nInput zeros are replaced by 1s. The previous number is 1, so 1+0=1. So maybe the zeros are replaced with the previous non-zero number. Wait, in that case, if the previous number is 1, zeros become 1. In Example 2's input array 3, the zeros after 5 are replaced by 5s. Then the next zeros after 5 (position 15) would be replaced by 5+1=6. That seems to fit. So perhaps the rule is that each zero in the input is replaced by the previous non-zero number plus 1. Wait, but in Example 1's third input, the zeros are replaced with 6,5,5. Let's check:\n\nIn Example1's third input, the input is [6,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,6,...]. The previous non-zero number before the zeros is 5. So according to the previous rule, zeros should be 5+1=6. But in the output, the zeros become 6,5,5. Hmm, that doesn't fit. The first zero becomes 6 (5+1), then the next two zeros become 5. Maybe there's a different pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros are replaced by the number that follows them. For example, in Example0's fourth input, the zeros are followed by 1, so they become 1. In Example1's third input, the zeros are between 5 and 5. So maybe they are replaced by the next number. But the next number after zeros is 5, so the zeros become 5. But in the output, they become 6,5,5. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts with the previous number plus 1 and then continues with the same number. For example, in Example0's fourth input: previous is 1, then zeros become 1,1,1. But that's just same as previous number, not plus 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: let's see if the transformation is about replacing sequences of zeros with a specific pattern. For instance, in Example0's fourth input, three zeros are replaced by three 1s. The position of these zeros is after a 1, then followed by 1s again. Maybe the zeros are replaced by the preceding number plus some increment, but that's unclear.\n\nLooking at the outputs, in all examples, whenever there's a zero in the input, it's replaced by a non-zero number in the output. The key is to find out what determines that number.\n\nLet me look at another example. Take Example 2's input array 10:\n\nInput: [1,7,6,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,5,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\nOutput: [1,7,6,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nHere, the zeros (positions 11-12) are replaced by 4s. The previous non-zero number before the zeros is 5 (position 10). So 5 is followed by zeros, but the replacement is 4. That doesn't fit a simple increment. Hmm. Wait, the next non-zero number after the zeros is 4 (position 13). So maybe zeros are replaced by the next non-zero number. But in Example0's fourth input, zeros are followed by 1, so replaced by 1. In Example1's third input, the zeros are followed by 5, but in the output they are replaced by 6,5,5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros are replaced by the number that comes after them, but that's not consistent. Let's check Example1's third input again. The zeros are in positions 3-5 of the input array. The next non-zero after the zeros is 5 (position 6). So if zeros are replaced by the next non-zero, they should all be 5s. But the output replaces them with 6,5,5. That's inconsistent.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different pattern. Looking at Example0's fourth input again. The input has [1,0,0,0,1,1...]. The output replaces zeros with 1s. So perhaps when a zero is surrounded by 1s, they become 1s. But in another case, Example1's third input, zeros are between 5 and 5, but replaced by 6,5,5. That doesn't make sense. So maybe the replacement depends on something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced with the current position in the array modulo some number. For example, in Example0's fourth input, the zeros are at positions 11,12,13. Let's see: 11 mod 6 (since the numbers go up to 6?) 11 mod 6 is 5. So maybe they become 5+1=6? But no, the output is 1s.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try to find a different approach. Maybe the transformation is that each zero is replaced by the previous non-zero number plus 1 modulo some value, perhaps 7 or something. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's fourth input, previous non-zero is 1. 1+1=2, but the zeros become 1. So that's not. Maybe modulo 6? 1+1=2 mod 6 is 2. Still not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are part of a run that is being filled in with a certain value. Let's consider the structure of the input lists. The inputs seem to be sequences where numbers are repeated in increasing counts. For instance, the first input in Example0 starts with 1,6,1,1,2,2,3,3,... which seems like counts increasing. Perhaps the transformation is related to some sort of run-length encoding or adjustment.\n\nWait, looking at the output in Example0's fourth input, after replacing the zeros, the sequence becomes a series of 1s. Maybe the zeros in the input indicate a break in the sequence, and the output corrects that by continuing the previous run. For example, in the input, after the 1, there are three zeros followed by 1,1. The output replaces the zeros with 1s, making a longer run of 1s. Similarly, in Example1's third input, the zeros might be part of a run that's being corrected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any occurrence of 0 in the input is replaced by the next number in the sequence. Wait, let's check that. For Example0's fourth input: after the zeros is 1. So zeros become 1. That fits. In Example1's third input: the zeros are followed by 5, so they become 5. But in the output, the first zero is replaced by 6. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe there's a combination of the previous and next numbers. For instance, the first zero in Example1's third input is between 5 and 5. The output replaces it with 6, then 5 and 5. How could that happen? Maybe the zeros are replaced with the previous number +1, then the next numbers. So 5 becomes 6, then the next zeros become 5. But that's not a consistent rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are part of a pattern where each zero is replaced by the previous number plus 1, and then the next zero by the same as the previous, etc. For example, 5 followed by zeros: first zero becomes 6 (5+1), next becomes 6 (same?), but in the output it's 6,5,5. That's not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to look for another pattern. In the output lists, the numbers seem to form runs where each number is repeated a certain number of times, increasing. For example, in Example0's output lists, the first line starts with 1,6,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,1,1,2,2,3,3,4. The runs are 1, then 6, then two 1s, two 2s, etc. The input in Example0's fourth line has a run of 1, then 6s, then 1 again, but with zeros in between which get replaced to extend the run of 1s. So perhaps the transformation is to fix the runs by replacing zeros with the correct continuation of the run.\n\nBut how is the correct continuation determined? For example, in Example0's fourth input, the run before the zeros is 1 (element 10), then zeros, then 1s. The output makes all the zeros into 1s, making the run longer. So maybe the zeros are considered as breaks in the run and are replaced with the current run's number.\n\nBut what defines the current run's number? Let's see: the run before the zeros in Example0's fourth input is 1. Then the zeros are replaced with 1s. So the current run continues. Similarly, in Example1's third input, the run before zeros is 5, then zeros, then 5 again. The output replaces the zeros with 6,5,5. That breaks the pattern. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced by the value that follows the longest possible increasing run. For example, in Example0, after a 1, the zeros are part of a run that should be 1s, so they become 1. In Example1's third input, maybe after 5s, the zeros are part of a run that should increment to 6, then back to 5s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: comparing the input and output arrays, the zeros in the input are replaced with numbers that are one less than the previous number, or something similar. For instance, in Example2's input array 10, the zeros are replaced by 4s, which is one less than the previous 5. But in Example0's fourth input, the previous number is 1, and zeros become 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each zero is replaced by the number that is the current position in the sequence. For example, in a circular manner. But I don't see how that would apply here.\n\nWait, looking at all the examples, the numbers in the output sequences seem to follow a pattern where each number is part of a group that increases in count. Like, 1, then 6, then 1,1, 2,2, etc. So each number is repeated n times, where n increases. But how does that relate to the zeros?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros are errors in the input that need to be corrected by following the same pattern as the surrounding numbers. For instance, if a sequence is supposed to be a series of increasing counts of numbers, the zeros are filled in with the appropriate number to continue the pattern.\n\nBut this is vague. Let's try to find a concrete rule. Let's take the Test Input and see what the expected output would be based on the training examples. The Test Input has several zeros. For example, in the second array of the Test Input:\n\nInput: [3,4,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,0,0,6,7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9]\n\nThe output for this array should replace the zeros. Looking at the training examples, when there are zeros between numbers, the replacement seems to depend on surrounding numbers. For example, in Example2's third input:\n\nInput: [5,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,5,5,0,0,4,5,5,5,0,0,7,7,7]\nOutput: [5,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7]\n\nHere, the zeros at positions 10-11 are replaced by 5s (previous number is 5), and zeros at 16-17 are replaced by 6s (previous is 5, next is 7? Or 5+1=6). So maybe the rule is to replace zeros with the previous number plus 1. Let's check:\n\nIn this case, previous number before zeros is 5. 5+1=6. But in the output, the first set of zeros are replaced by 5s. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So that can't be the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe zeros are replaced by the previous number. But in Example0's fourth input, zeros after 1 become 1s. In Example2's input, zeros after 5 become 5s. But in Example1's third input, zeros after 5 become 6,5,5. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement depends on the position of the zero in the array. For example, if a zero is at a certain index, it's replaced by a specific value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced by the number that is the same as the first element of the array. But in Example0's fourth input, the first element is 2, but zeros are replaced by 1. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the zeros are replaced by the next number in a cycle. For example, if numbers are from 1 to 6, then 7 wraps back to 1. But in Example1, the numbers go up to 7. For instance, in Example1's third input, the zeros are replaced with 6,5,5. The numbers in the array are 5,6,7,1, etc. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Let me try to look for a pattern in how the zeros are replaced in each example.\n\nTake Example0's fourth input again:\n\nInput: [2,1,6,6,1,6,6,6,6,6,1,0,0,0,1,1,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nThe zeros here are replaced by 1s. The previous non-zero is 1, the next is 1. So maybe zeros between the same number are replaced by that number.\n\nIn Example1's third input:\n\nInput: [6,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1]\nOutput: [6,5,5,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1]\n\nHere, the zeros are between two 5s. The output replaces the first zero with 6, then the next two with 5. Not sure why.\n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern where the number of zeros determines what they are replaced with. For example, three zeros could be replaced by a sequence of 6,5,5. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros are replaced by the previous number plus 1, but if that leads to a higher number than the next non-zero, then use the next non-zero. For example, in Example1's third input, the previous number is 5. 5+1=6. The next non-zero after the zeros is 5. So the first zero becomes 6, but the next zeros become 5 because 6 is higher than 5. But how?\n\nAnother idea: the zeros are replaced by the previous number plus 1 modulo the maximum number in the sequence. For Example0, max number is 6. So 1+1=2, but zeros become 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is such that the sequence increases by 1 after a certain count. For example, each run of a number increases by 2 each time. But this is getting too vague.\n\nMaybe I need to look at multiple examples at once. Let's take the Test Input's second array:\n\nInput: [3,4,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,0,0,6,7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9]\n\nLooking at similar examples, perhaps the zeros here are replaced by 5+1=6. The previous non-zero is 5, so zeros become 6,6. Then the next numbers are 6,7, etc. So output would be [3,4,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9]. But wait, looking at Example2's third input, zeros after 5 were replaced by 5s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced by the next number in the sequence. In this case, after 5,5,5 comes 0,0, then 6. So the zeros should be 6,6. Let's check the output for this array in the test input.\n\nAnother approach: In the training examples, whenever there's a zero in the input, in the output, it's replaced by the number that is the next in a sequence that's being built. For example, in Example0's fourth input, after a series of 6s and 1, the zeros are part of the 1's run, so they become 1. In Example1's third input, the zeros are in a sequence that alternates between 5 and 6, so maybe the first zero becomes 6 (the next in the sequence), then 5 again. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement of zeros follows a specific rule: for each zero, look at the previous non-zero number and the next non-zero number, and replace the zero with the previous number +1 if that doesn't exceed the next number. If previous+1 is greater than next, then use next. Otherwise, use previous+1.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example0's fourth input:\n\nPrevious number before zeros is 1. Next number after zeros is 1. So 1+1=2, which exceeds the next number (1). So zeros are replaced with the next number, which is 1. Hence, three 1s.\n\nIn Example1's third input:\n\nPrevious number is 5. Next number is 5. So previous+1=6. Since 6 >5, but next is 5, but maybe since the next is 5, we can't have 6. So perhaps we use the previous number. But the output replaces the first zero with 6, then 5 and 5. This contradicts that idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first zero is replaced with previous +1, and subsequent zeros with the same as previous +1, but that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look at the Test Input and try to apply the same transformations as in the training examples. For instance, in the Test Input's first array:\n\n[4, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]\n\nThis array has no zeros, so the output would be the same.\n\nThe second array in Test Input is:\n\n[3,4,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,0,0,6,7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9]\n\nThe zeros here are at positions 10 and 11. Looking at similar training examples (like Example2's third input), zeros between numbers are replaced with the previous number. In Example2's third input, zeros after 5 are replaced with 5s. So maybe here, the zeros after 5 (positions 10-11) are replaced with 5s. But the next number after zeros is 6, so perhaps they become 5+1=6. Let's check Example2's third input again. The input was [5,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,5,5,0,0,4,5,5,5,0,0,7,7,7]. The output replaced the zeros after 5 with 5s, then the next zeros after 5 with 6s. So previous number is 5, zeros become 5, then previous number 5 becomes 6. So perhaps the rule is that zeros are replaced by the previous number plus 1.\n\nWait, in Example2's third input, the first zeros after 5 are replaced by 5s. That contradicts this. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of zeros determines the replacement. For example, two zeros after 5 in Test Input's second array would become 5+1=6 and 6. So replacing each zero with 6. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are part of a sequence that is being counted, and they are replaced by the current count. But I can't see how.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the safest bet is to replace each zero in the Test Input with the previous non-zero number plus 1. Let's test this:\n\nIn Test Input's second array, zeros are after 5. So 5+1=6. Replace zeros with 6. So the array becomes [3,4,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,...]. But in the training examples, like Example0's fourth input, zeros after 1 become 1+1=2, but in the output they became 1. So this rule doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, zeros are replaced by the previous number. So in Test Input's second array, zeros become 5,5. Then the next number is 6. So the output would be [3,4,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9]. But in Example1's third input, zeros between 5s became 6,5,5. So maybe the first zero becomes previous+1, then the rest previous number.\n\nBut this is inconsistent. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that zeros are replaced by the previous non-zero number. Let's check the training examples for this.\n\nIn Example0's fourth input, zeros after 1 become 1. Previous number is 1, so replaced by 1. Fits.\n\nIn Example1's third input, zeros after 5 become 5. But the output has 6,5,5. So doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. Looking at Example1's third input's output: the zeros are replaced with 6,5,5. The previous number is 5 (element 2), then zeros, then 5 (element 6). So perhaps the first zero is replaced with previous +1 (5+1=6), and the next two zeros are replaced with the next number (5). So the first zero is previous+1, others are next number. Let's test this rule.\n\nIn Test Input's second array, the zeros are between 5 and 6. Previous is 5, next is 6. So first zero becomes 5+1=6, next zero becomes 6. So replaced with 6,6. So the array becomes [3,4,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,...].\n\nBut in Example1's third input, the next number after zeros is 5, so the rule would be first zero is 5+1=6, then zeros are replaced with next number 5. So the output is 6,5,5. That matches.\n\nSo the rule could be: For a sequence of zeros, replace each zero with the previous number +1, unless the next number is less than previous +1, in which case use the next number. Or perhaps, for each zero, if the previous number +1 is less than or equal to the next number, replace with previous +1. Otherwise, replace with next number.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's try applying this to the Test Input.\n\nTest Input's second array: zeros are between 5 and 6. Previous is 5, next is 6. So previous +1 is 6, which is equal to next. So replace zeros with 6. So the two zeros become 6,6.\n\nThird array in Test Input: [4,3,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,0,0,5,5,6,6,6,6,7,7,7]. Zeros after 4. Previous is 4, next is 5. 4+1=5, which is equal to next. So zeros become 5,5.\n\nFourth array in Test Input: [4,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,0,0,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6]. Zeros after 4. Previous is 4, next is 4. 4+1=5, which is greater than next (4). So replace with next number 4. But in the output for Example2's third input, similar zeros were replaced with 5,5. So this is conflicting.\n\nHmm. This suggests that maybe the rule is to replace zeros with the previous number +1, regardless of the next number. Even if it's higher, but in some cases, like Example1's third input, the first zero is replaced with 6 (5+1), and the next two with 5 (next number). But how to determine when to stop?\n\nAlternatively, the zeros are replaced with the previous number +1 for the first zero, then the next zeros are replaced with the same as the first replacement. So in Example1's third input, three zeros: first becomes 6, then the next two also become 6. But the output is 6,5,5. So that's not.\n\nThis is really confusing. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that zeros are replaced with the previous number +1. Let's apply this to the Test Input and see if the output matches the pattern of the training examples.\n\nTest Input's second array: zeros after 5 become 6,6. So the array becomes [3,4,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9].\n\nAnother array in Test Input: [6,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. No zeros here, so output same.\n\nAnother array: [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4]. The zeros at the beginning. Previous number is none, but next number is 3. So according to the rule, replace with next number? Or previous is 0, which is not allowed. Alternatively, maybe leading zeros are replaced with 1. But this is unclear. In training examples, leading zeros may not exist. But in this case, perhaps the zeros are replaced with 3 (next number).\n\nBut in Example0's first array, there are no zeros. So the output is the same.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with replacing each zero with the previous non-zero number +1. For leading zeros, perhaps use the next non-zero number.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\nFirst array: no zeros, so output same.\n\nSecond array: zeros replaced with 5+1=6, so [3,4,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,...].\n\nThird array: zeros after 4 become 4+1=5. So [4,3,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,7,7,7].\n\nFourth array: zeros after 4 become 5. [4,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6].\n\nFifth array: zeros after 3 (input: [5,4,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5]). Zeros become 3+1=4. So replaced with 4,4.\n\nSixth array: zeros replaced with 4.\n\nAnd so on for other arrays. \n\nFor example, the array [1,7,6,5,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3] would have zeros after 5 replaced with 6, then zeros after 3 replaced with 4 (3+1=4). But this is just a guess based on the previous pattern.\n\nFollowing this rule, I'll generate the output for the Test Input.",
