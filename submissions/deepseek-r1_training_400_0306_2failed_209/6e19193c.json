        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input grids and output grids. The numbers in the grids are mostly zeros except for some 7s, 9s, and in the test case, 8s. The outputs seem to add more of those numbers in certain positions. Let's look at the training examples first.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some 7s arranged in what looks like a vertical line in the middle. Then the output adds more 7s in diagonal lines above and below the original ones. Like, in the output, there are 7s forming diagonal lines going up to the top left and down to the bottom right. Maybe the pattern is that each 7 is creating a diagonal line extending in both directions?\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has 9s arranged in a similar vertical pattern. The output has those 9s and then diagonal lines of 9s spreading out from them. But here, the diagonals are longer. The original 9s are in a vertical line, and then the output creates a sort of X shape around them, but maybe only in one direction. Wait, in the output of example 1, the 9s form a diagonal from the top left to the bottom right. Like, the original vertical group in the middle, and then the output adds a diagonal line that starts from the bottom left and moves up to the top right. Wait, no. Let me check the input and output again.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 9s are in the middle rows, like rows 1,2,6,7. Then the output adds 9s in a diagonal pattern that starts from row 5 (the fifth row has a 9 in the first position) and goes up to the right. Wait, looking at the output rows, starting from row 5 (0-based or 1-based? The examples are written with the first line as row 0 probably). Let's see:\n\nOutput for Example 1:\n\nRow 1: ends with a 9 (index 9)\nRow 2: 9 at index 8\nRow 3: 9 at index 6, then 9 at index 7?\nWait, looking at the output, maybe the diagonals are spreading from the original positions. Like each 9 in the input is the center, and then a diagonal line is created going up-left and down-right or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each number (7,9,8) is part of a structure that's being rotated or mirrored. Another possibility is that the output adds a reflection of the original pattern in some direction.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input and output. The input has a vertical line of 7s in the middle (rows 2,3,4,5), and then the output adds two diagonal lines. The top part has 7s moving left and up, and the bottom part has 7s moving right and down. Like forming an hourglass shape around the original vertical line.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output:\n\nThe original vertical lines are still present. Then, above them, starting from row 0, there's a 7 in position [0][4], then in row 1, [1][3], row 2 stays the same. Then below the original structure, in row 6, there's a 7 at [6][5], row7 [7][4], row8 [8][3], row9 [9][2]. So that's a diagonal line going down and to the left. Similarly, above the original vertical, the 7s form a diagonal going up and to the left? Wait, in row 0, column 4, which is to the right of the original vertical (original 7s are in columns 1 and 1-2, etc. Hmm, maybe not. Let me look at the exact positions.\n\nOriginal input in Example 0:\n\nRow 2: [0,7,0,...]\nRow3: [0,7,7,0,...]\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0]\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0]\n\nSo the original vertical structures are in columns 1 (rows2-3), and columns 6-7 (rows4-5). Then the output adds:\n\nIn the first two rows, row0 has a 7 at position4 (column4?), row1 has 7 at column3. Then rows6-9 have 7s moving from column5 down to column2. So maybe the original vertical segments are creating diagonal lines that spread outward. Like, each vertical line of 7s is acting as a seed for diagonal lines in both directions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the original input and some mirrored or rotated version. For example, the original vertical lines are mirrored along a diagonal axis.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is that each vertical line in the input is transformed into a diagonal line in the output. Or the output is the original lines plus their diagonals rotated 45 degrees.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the positions of the non-zero elements in the input and output.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 7s are at:\n\nRow2: column1\n\nRow3: columns1,2\n\nRow4: columns6,7\n\nRow5: column7\n\nIn the output, the 7s are in the original positions plus:\n\nRow0: column4\n\nRow1: column3\n\nRow6: column5\n\nRow7: column4\n\nRow8: column3\n\nRow9: column2\n\nSo those form a diagonal from (0,4) down to (9,2) \u2014 each step down a row, column decreases by 1. Similarly, another diagonal starting at row6, column5 (7 in row6, column5), then row7, column4, etc. Wait, but how do these connect to the original input?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking each vertical segment in the input and extending it diagonally upwards and downwards. For example, the vertical line of 7s in rows2-3, column1-2. Then, moving upwards, they form a diagonal going left. In the output, the top part (rows0-1) have 7s moving left each step. Then in the lower part, rows6-9 have 7s moving left each step down. Similarly, the other vertical segment (rows4-5, columns6-7) might have their own diagonals.\n\nWait, let's check the original vertical segments:\n\nFirst vertical segment:\n\nRow2: column1\n\nRow3: columns1,2. Wait, maybe this is more like a 2x2 block? Or perhaps two separate vertical lines. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each individual cell with a non-zero number in the input is the center of a diagonal cross. For example, each 7 in the input generates a diagonal line going up-left and down-right. But looking at Example 0, the output has 7s that form a diagonal line from row0, column4 to row9, column2. That's a diagonal going from top right to bottom left, but where does that come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each non-zero number is part of a \"V\" shape or a chevron pattern. For instance, the input has certain elements, and the output adds elements to form a symmetric pattern around them.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input has 9s in rows1,2,6,7. The output adds a diagonal of 9s starting from row5, column0 (the 9 in row5, column0) up to row0, column9. So that's a diagonal line from (5,0) to (0,9), but how does that connect to the input?\n\nWait, in Example1's input, the 9s are arranged as follows:\n\nRow1: columns3,4\n\nRow2: column4\n\nRow6: column3\n\nRow7: columns3,4\n\nSo the input has a vertical structure in rows1-2 (columns3-4) and another in rows6-7 (columns3-4). The output then adds a diagonal line of 9s starting from row5, column0 up to row0, column5, and then continues to row0, column9? Wait, in the output:\n\nRow5 has a 9 at column0 (row5, column0 is 9?)\n\nWait, looking at the output for Example1:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,9] \u2192 column9 has a 9.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0] \u2192 column8.\n\nRow3: [0,0,9,0,0,0,0,9,0,0] \u2192 columns2 and 7.\n\nRow4: [0,9,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0] \u2192 columns1 and 6.\n\nRow5: [9,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns0 and5.\n\nSo that's a diagonal from (5,0) to (0,5) and then another from (0,5) to (0,9)? Or perhaps the diagonal continues from (5,0) to (0,5) and then another diagonal from (5,5) to (0,9)? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each vertical group in the input is mirrored along the diagonal. For example, in Example1, the input has vertical groups, and the output reflects them along the main diagonal (row to column). But I'm not sure how that would work.\n\nAnother angle: Let's think about the movement of the non-zero elements. In Example0, the original 7s are in the middle columns. The output adds 7s that form diagonals going up-left and down-right. For example, the top part of the output has 7s starting from row0, column4 and going down to row9, column2. Each step down a row, the column decreases by 1. So that's a diagonal line. Similarly, the original vertical segments might have their own diagonals.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that for each non-zero element in the input, the output creates a diagonal line extending both upwards and downwards from that element, moving left each time. For example, a 7 at (row2, column1) would generate 7s at (row1, column0) and (row3, column2), but that doesn't exactly fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each vertical line in the input and creating two diagonal lines: one moving up-left and the other down-left. For example, a vertical line of two 7s would generate two diagonals.\n\nLooking at Example0's output, the upper diagonal starts at row0, column4 and moves down to row9, column2. But how does that relate to the input's vertical lines? The original vertical lines are around column1 and columns6-7. The diagonal in the output is in column4, which is between them. Maybe the diagonals are formed by merging the two vertical lines into a single diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonals are mirror images of the original vertical structures. For instance, if you take the vertical lines and reflect them over a diagonal axis, you get the diagonal lines in the output.\n\nAnother approach: Look at the positions of the new elements added. In Example0's output, the new 7s form two diagonal lines. One starts at (0,4) and goes down-left to (9,2). The other starts at (6,5) and goes down-left to (9,2). Wait, perhaps the original vertical lines in the input are split into two parts and each part is extended diagonally.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as containing two separate \"blocks\" of 7s. One is in the upper part (rows2-3, columns1-2) and another in the lower part (rows4-5, columns6-7). The output adds diagonals that connect these blocks. For instance, the upper block's diagonal goes up-left and the lower block's diagonal goes down-left, forming an 'X' shape.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the input and a rotated version. Rotating the input 45 degrees and overlaying it. But how?\n\nWait, another possibility: The output is created by taking the input and adding a diamond pattern around each vertical segment. For example, each vertical line of two cells (like the 7s in rows2-3, columns1-2) would form a diamond shape with diagonals.\n\nAlternatively, each vertical segment in the input is transformed into a diamond shape. For example, a vertical line of length 2 would create a diamond with diagonals extending two steps in each direction.\n\nBut in Example0's input, the upper vertical segment is two rows (row2: 7 in column1, row3: 7s in columns1-2). So the output has a diagonal line above and below. Maybe each 7 in the input generates a diagonal line in both directions.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each cell in the input with a non-zero value is part of a diagonal line that extends in both directions (up-left and down-right, or up-right and down-left), and the output includes all these lines.\n\nBut in Example0, the 7 in row2, column1: if it extends up-left, then we'd have 7s at (1,0), (0,-1) which is invalid. But in the output, there's a 7 at row1, column3. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by shifting the input's columns in a certain way. For example, shifting each row by an increasing number of positions. For Example0, looking at the new rows added above the original input's rows, like row0 and row1 have 7s shifted to the left or right.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the first two rows have 7s in column4 and 3, which are to the right of the original 7s (column1). So maybe each row above is shifted to the right by (row difference). For example, row0 is two rows above row2 (original 7 in row2, column1). So row0 would be shifted by 2 columns to the right? 1 + 2 = 3, but in row0, it's column4. Hmm, that doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal steps between the added 7s. For example, in Example0's output, the 7 in row0, column4, then row1, column3, row6, column5, row7, column4, etc. The step between these is a shift of 1 column per row. So from row0 to row1, column4\u21923 (left), but from row5 to row6, column7\u21925? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal lines are arranged such that for each vertical segment in the input, there's a diagonal line that starts at the top of the segment and moves up-left, and another that starts at the bottom and moves down-left.\n\nFor example, in Example0's upper vertical segment (rows2-3), the top is row2, column1. So moving up-left from there would be row1, column0 (but that's 0 in the output). Instead, maybe moving right. The output's row0 has 7 at column4, row1 at column3. So perhaps the top of the vertical segment (row2, column1) is connected via a diagonal line moving up and to the right. But row2 to row1, column1 to column3? That doesn't make sense. Wait, row0: column4 is to the right of column1. So maybe the diagonal line is moving up and to the right. But the step from row0 to row1 is column4 to column3, which is left. Not sure.\n\nMaybe the key is to look for the number of non-zero elements in the input and output. For Example0, input has 7s: let's count. Row2:1, row3:2, row4:2, row5:1. Total 6. Output has more. The output's rows have:\n\nRow0:1\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:2\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:1\n\nRow7:1\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow9:1\n\nTotal 12. So exactly double. So each input cell generates two cells in the output. But how?\n\nIn Example1's input, the 9s are:\n\nRow1: 2, row2:1, row6:1, row7:2. Total 6. Output has more. Let's count output:\n\nRow1:2 (original) +1 new =3?\n\nWait, row1: [0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,9] \u2192 three 9s.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0] \u2192 two 9s.\n\nRow3: [0,0,9,0,0,0,0,9,0,0] \u2192 two.\n\nRow4: [0,9,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0] \u2192 two.\n\nRow5: [9,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0] \u2192 two.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 one.\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 two.\n\nOthers: zeros. So total 3+2+2+2+2+1+2 = 14. Not sure if this helps.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that each original non-zero cell is part of a diagonal line that extends both upwards and downwards, each time moving one row and one column in a certain direction.\n\nLooking at Example0's output again. The new 7s added in the upper part (rows0-1) are at (0,4), (1,3). Then, the lower part has (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2). So that's a diagonal line from (0,4) to (9,2), moving down-left. Similarly, the upper part's line is (0,4) to (1,3) but then stops. Wait, but in the original input's vertical segments, how does this line start?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original vertical segments are being \"rotated\" 45 degrees into diagonal lines, which could explain the new positions.\n\nFor instance, a vertical line in column1 (rows2-3) becomes a diagonal line starting at row0, column4 (maybe shifted some way). But how?\n\nAlternatively, the transformation involves creating a diagonal line that's a reflection of the vertical line across a certain axis. For example, reflecting over a diagonal axis would turn vertical lines into horizontal lines, but that's not what's happening.\n\nAnother thought: the output seems to have the original input's non-zero elements plus new ones arranged in a pattern that creates symmetry. For example, in Example0's output, the original vertical structures are present, and there are two diagonal lines that form an hourglass shape.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the original input plus a rotated version of it. For example, rotating the input 45 degrees and combining with the original. But how to rotate a grid by 45 degrees? It's a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the original input plus a mirrored version along a certain axis, but again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for the direction in which new elements are added. In Example0, the new 7s are added in a diagonal that starts at row0, column4 and moves down to the left. Then another diagonal starts at row6, column5 and moves down to the left. These could be extensions of the original vertical structures.\n\nWait, the original vertical segments in Example0 are in column1 (rows2-3) and columns6-7 (rows4-5). The diagonal in the output starts at column4 (row0) and moves down-left to column2 (row9). Column4 is between columns1 and6, so maybe it's the midpoint between them? 1 and6: midpoint is 3.5. Not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal is the sum of the two vertical segments. For example, the first vertical segment's center is at column1.5 (rows2-3), and the second's at column6.5 (rows4-5). The diagonal between these centers would be a line from (2.5, 1.5) to (4.5, 6.5). But that's a line in the grid, but how would that translate to the diagonal in the output?\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal in the output is formed by combining the vertical segments. For example, the upper vertical segment (columns1-2) is extended upwards to the right, and the lower vertical segment (columns6-7) is extended downwards to the left, forming a diagonal connecting them.\n\nBut this is getting a bit stuck. Let's look at the test input and see if applying a similar pattern would help.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 8s are in:\n\nRow2: column4\n\nRow3: columns3,4\n\nRow4: columns7,8\n\nRow5: column7\n\nRow6: columns2,3\n\nRow7: column3\n\nSo there are two vertical segments: one around row2-3, columns3-4 (upper part), and another around row6-7, columns2-3 (lower part), and a vertical segment in row4-5, columns7-8.\n\nFollowing the pattern from the training examples, perhaps each vertical segment will generate diagonal lines in the output.\n\nFor example, the upper vertical segment (rows2-3, columns3-4) would generate diagonals going up-left and down-right.\n\nThe lower vertical segment (rows6-7, columns2-3) would generate diagonals going up-left and down-right.\n\nThe middle vertical segment (rows4-5, columns7-8) would generate diagonals.\n\nBut how exactly?\n\nLooking at Example0 and Example1, when there are vertical segments, the output adds diagonals that spread out from them.\n\nIn the test case, the output should have diagonal lines of 8s extending from each of the vertical segments.\n\nFor the upper vertical segment (rows2-3, columns3-4):\n\nMaybe generate a diagonal going up-left (columns decreasing) and up-right (columns increasing). But in Example0, the upper vertical segments caused a diagonal to the left.\n\nAlternatively, for each vertical segment, the output adds a diagonal line going upwards to the left and downwards to the left, creating a symmetric pattern.\n\nIn the test input, the upper segment is at columns3-4. So the diagonal upwards would start at row2-3 and go up-left. For example, row1 would have an 8 at column2, row0 at column1. Similarly, the lower part of this segment would go down-left, row4, column2, row5 column1, etc. But in the existing input, there's already a vertical segment in row4-5, columns7-8. So maybe the diagonals from different segments interact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to take each vertical line and create a diagonal line that moves left by one column each row upwards and downwards.\n\nFor example, for each cell in the vertical line:\n\nOriginal cell at (row, col):\n\nUpwards: for each step up i rows, the column becomes col - i.\n\nDownwards: for each step down i rows, the column becomes col - i.\n\nSo, for the vertical line in rows2-3, columns3-4:\n\nRow2, column4:\n\nUpwards: row1:4-1=3, row0:4-2=2.\n\nDownwards: row3:4-1=3 (but original row3 is part of the vertical line), row4:4-2=2, etc.\n\nSimilarly, row3, column3:\n\nUpwards: row2:3-1=2 (original row2, column4 is already part of the input), row1:3-2=1, etc.\n\nBut this might cause overlapping 8s in the output.\n\nIf we apply this to the test input:\n\nFor row2, column4:\n\nUpwards: row1, column3 (4-1=3), row0, column2 (4-2=2).\n\nDownwards: row3, column3 (4-1=3), row4, column2 (4-2=2), row5, column1, etc.\n\nBut existing row3, column3 is part of the vertical line, so maybe it's already present.\n\nFor row3, column3:\n\nUpwards: row2, column2 (3-1=2), row1, column1 (3-2=1), row0, column0 (3-3=0).\n\nDownwards: row4, column2 (3-1=2), row5, column1 (3-2=1), row6, column0 (3-3=0).\n\nSimilarly, row3, column4:\n\nUpwards: row2, column3 (4-1=3), row1, column2 (4-2=2), row0, column1 (4-3=1).\n\nDownwards: row4, column3 (4-1=3), row5, column2 (4-2=2), row6, column1 (4-3=1), etc.\n\nBut the existing vertical line in row4-5, columns7-8:\n\nFor row4, column7:\n\nUpwards: row3, column6 (7-1=6), row2, column5 (7-2=5), row1, column4 (7-3=4), etc.\n\nDownwards: row5, column6 (7-1=6), row6, column5 (7-2=5), etc.\n\nRow4, column8:\n\nUpwards: row3, column7 (8-1=7), row2, column6 (8-2=6), etc.\n\nDownwards: row5, column7 (8-1=7), row6, column6 (8-2=6), etc.\n\nRow5, column7:\n\nUpwards: row4, column6 (7-1=6), row3, column5 (7-2=5), etc.\n\nDownwards: row6, column6 (7-1=6), row7, column5 (7-2=5), etc.\n\nFor the lower vertical segment in rows6-7, columns2-3:\n\nRow6, column2:\n\nUpwards: row5, column1 (2-1=1), row4, column0 (2-2=0).\n\nDownwards: row7, column1 (2-1=1), row8, column0 (2-2=0).\n\nRow6, column3:\n\nUpwards: row5, column2 (3-1=2), row4, column1 (3-2=1), row3, column0 (3-3=0).\n\nDownwards: row7, column2 (3-1=2), row8, column1 (3-2=1), row9, column0 (3-3=0).\n\nRow7, column3:\n\nUpwards: row6, column2 (3-1=2), row5, column1 (3-2=1), row4, column0 (3-3=0).\n\nDownwards: row8, column2 (3-1=2), row9, column1 (3-2=1).\n\nIf we apply this logic, the output would have a lot of 8s in various positions. Let's see if this aligns with the training examples.\n\nIn Example0's input, the vertical line in row2, column1:\n\nUpwards: row1, column0 (1-1=0), row0, column-1 (invalid). So only row1, column0. But in the output, there's a 7 in row0, column4. So that doesn't fit. Hence, this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the pattern isn't simply extending each vertical cell upwards and downwards by one column left per row.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each vertical segment in the input is converted into a diagonal line that starts at the top of the segment and moves to the right, and another that starts at the bottom and moves to the left.\n\nIn Example0, the upper vertical segment (rows2-3, columns1-2):\n\nTop is row2, column1. Moving right each row up: row1, column2; row0, column3. But in the output, row0 has 7 at column4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal moves up and to the left. Row2, column1 \u2192 row1, column0 \u2192 row0, invalid. But in the output, the 7s are at row0, column4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of the test input and try to apply the pattern from the examples.\n\nTest Input has vertical segments:\n\n1. Upper segment: rows2-3, columns4 (row2) and 3-4 (row3). So it's a vertical line from row2 to row3 in columns3-4.\n\n2. Middle segment: rows4-5, columns7-8 (row4) and 7 (row5).\n\n3. Lower segment: rows6-7, columns2-3 (row6) and 3 (row7).\n\nIn Example0 and Example1, the output adds diagonal lines extending from the vertical segments.\n\nPerhaps for each vertical segment, the output adds two diagonal lines: one going up-left and one going down-left.\n\nFor example, in Example0's upper vertical segment (columns1-2, rows2-3), the diagonal line starts at row0, column4 (which is to the right of the original segment) and moves down-left. Similarly, the lower vertical segment (columns6-7, rows4-5) has a diagonal starting at row6, column5 and moving down-left.\n\nBut how are these starting positions determined?\n\nAlternatively, each vertical segment has a midpoint, and the diagonal line starts from that midpoint and extends in a certain direction.\n\nFor the upper segment in the test input (rows2-3, columns3-4):\n\nMidpoint row: 2.5, midpoint column: 3.5. So the diagonal line might start around there. But in grid terms, perhaps the diagonal starts at row2, column3.5 \u2192 but since columns are integers, maybe the starting point is row2, column3 and row3, column4, forming a diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal lines are formed by taking the vertical segments and shifting them upwards and to the right, and downwards and to the left.\n\nFor Example0's upper vertical segment (rows2-3, columns1-2):\n\nShifting upwards and to the right by 2 rows and 3 columns \u2192 but this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal lines in the output are the sum of the original vertical segments and their mirror images across a certain axis.\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to have a pattern where each vertical segment is mirrored along a diagonal line that's at 45 degrees. For instance, a vertical line becomes a diagonal line in the output.\n\nBut how to mirror a vertical line along a diagonal axis. For example, the vertical line in columns1 would map to a diagonal line in the output. The mirror axis could be the main diagonal (row=column), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that each vertical segment is rotated 45 degrees, which would turn it into a diagonal line.\n\nBut rotating a vertical line of two cells (like in Example0's upper segment) by 45 degrees would create a diagonal line of two cells. But in the output, there are more cells in the diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to create a larger diamond shape around each vertical segment.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Let's try to see the test input's expected output.\n\nTest Input's vertical segments are:\n\nUpper: rows2-3, columns3-4 \u2192 two cells (row2,4 and row3,3-4).\n\nMiddle: rows4-5, columns7-8.\n\nLower: rows6-7, columns2-3.\n\nIf we follow Example0's pattern, each vertical segment will generate a diagonal line moving down-left and up-right.\n\nFor example, the upper vertical segment (columns3-4) may generate a diagonal line starting above it, moving down-left. So, the diagonal starts at row0 or row1 and moves down-left.\n\nIn Example0's output, the upper diagonal starts at row0, column4 and moves down-left each row. So for the test input's upper segment, perhaps the diagonal starts at row0, column7 (but that's a guess), and moves down-left.\n\nWait, in Example0, the vertical segments are in column1 and columns6-7. The diagonal in the output starts at column4, which is between them. So perhaps the diagonal is the midpoint between the two vertical segments.\n\nFor the test input, the upper vertical segment is at columns3-4, middle at columns7-8, and lower at columns2-3. The midpoint between columns3-4 and7-8 would be column5.5. So maybe the diagonal starts there.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal lines are connecting the different vertical segments.\n\nBut this is too vague. Let's think of the test input and what the output might look like.\n\nIn Example0, the output's new 7s are in a diagonal from (0,4) to (9,2), and another from (6,5) to (9,2). So perhaps the test input's upper segment (columns3-4) would generate a diagonal starting at row0, column5 or 6, moving down-left. The middle segment (columns7-8) would generate a diagonal starting at row0, column9, and the lower segment (columns2-3) would generate a diagonal starting at row5, column0.\n\nBut this is purely speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number in the input (7,9,8) determines the direction of the diagonal. For example, 7 and 8 might be irrelevant, but the pattern is the same regardless of the number.\n\nIn Example0 and Example1, the numbers are different, but the pattern is similar. So the number itself doesn't affect the pattern, only the positions.\n\nSo, for the test input with 8s, the pattern would be similar to Example0 and Example1: add diagonal lines extending from the vertical segments.\n\nLooking at Example1's input: the vertical segments are in columns3-4 (rows1-2 and6-7). The output adds a diagonal from row5, column0 to row0, column5 and then continues to row0, column9. Also, in the lower part, there's a diagonal from row6, column3 upwards.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nAnother approach: For each vertical segment, add a diagonal line that starts at the top of the segment and moves up and to the left, and another that starts at the bottom and moves down and to the left.\n\nIn Example0's upper segment (row2-3, column1-2):\n\nTop is row2, column1. Moving up-left would be row1, column0; row0, -1 (invalid). But in the output, the diagonal starts at row0, column4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal starts at the top of the segment and moves up and to the right. So row2, column1 \u2192 row1, column2 \u2192 row0, column3. But in the output, the 7 is at row0, column4. Not matching.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's think about the positions of the new elements in the outputs relative to the original segments.\n\nExample0's new elements:\n\nRow0:4, Row1:3, Row6:5, Row7:4, Row8:3, Row9:2.\n\nSo these positions form a diagonal from (0,4) to (9,2), which is a diagonal line with a negative slope (each step down, column decreases by 1).\n\nAnother diagonal from (6,5) to (9,2): but how does this relate to the original segments?\n\nThe original vertical segments are at columns1 and 6-7. The diagonal in row0-1 is at columns4-3, which is to the right of the original columns1. The lower diagonal starts at row6, column5 (which is between the middle of columns6-7 and columns2-3).\n\nMaybe the diagonal is formed by connecting the midpoints between the vertical segments.\n\nIn Example0, the two vertical segments are at column1 and columns6-7. The midpoint between columns1 and6-7 is around column4 (1 + (6-1)/2 = 3.5, but column4 is close). So the diagonal starts at row0, column4 and moves down-left. Similarly, the middle of the vertical segments in the test input's upper and middle segments could be column5 (3.5 and7.5 midpoint is (3.5 +7.5)/2 =5.5 \u2192 column5 or 6). But this is a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal lines in the output are centered between the vertical segments of the input. For Example0, between columns1 and6-7, the center is around column4, hence the diagonal starts there.\n\nIn the test input, the vertical segments are at columns3-4,7-8, and2-3. The midpoints between these would be columns5.5 (between3-4 and7-8) and columns2.5 (between2-3 and3-4). So the diagonal lines would start at those midpoints. For example, a diagonal starting at row0, column6 and moving down-left to row9, column4, and another starting at row5, column2 and moving down-left.\n\nBut how does this apply to the test input's specific case?\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal lines are created by taking each vertical segment and shifting it to the right by (number of rows from the top) or something similar.\n\nThis is taking too long. Maybe I should try to write the output for the test input based on the pattern from the examples.\n\nIn Example0 and Example1, the output includes the original vertical segments plus diagonal lines extending from them. In Example0, the diagonal lines are above and below the original segments. For the test input, the expected output would have the original 8s plus diagonals extending from each vertical segment.\n\nFor the upper vertical segment (rows2-3, columns3-4):\n\nMaybe a diagonal line going up-left starting from row0, column5 and moving down-left to row3, column2. Then another diagonal starting from row4, column6 and moving down-left to row7, column3.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Alternatively, look for the number of new elements added. The test input's output should have the original 8s plus new ones forming diagonals.\n\nAlternatively, for each vertical segment in the input, add a diagonal line moving down-left and up-left.\n\nFor example, the upper segment (rows2-3, columns3-4):\n\nEach cell in this segment would generate a diagonal line moving down-left and up-left.\n\nFor row2, column4:\n\nUp-left: row1, column3; row0, column2.\n\nDown-left: row3, column3 (existing), row4, column2.\n\nFor row3, column3:\n\nUp-left: row2, column2; row1, column1; row0, column0.\n\nDown-left: row4, column2; row5, column1; row6, column0.\n\nFor row3, column4:\n\nUp-left: row2, column3; row1, column2; row0, column1.\n\nDown-left: row4, column3; row5, column2; row6, column1; etc.\n\nSimilarly, the middle segment (rows4-5, columns7-8):\n\nRow4, column7:\n\nUp-left: row3, column6; row2, column5; row1, column4; row0, column3.\n\nDown-left: row5, column6; row6, column5; row7, column4; row8, column3; row9, column2.\n\nRow4, column8:\n\nUp-left: row3, column7; row2, column6; row1, column5; row0, column4.\n\nDown-left: row5, column7; row6, column6; row7, column5; row8, column4; row9, column3.\n\nRow5, column7:\n\nUp-left: row4, column6; row3, column5; row2, column4; row1, column3; row0, column2.\n\nDown-left: row6, column6; row7, column5; row8, column4; row9, column3.\n\nRow5, column8:\n\nBut in the test input, row5's column8 is 0. Oh wait, row5 has 8 only at column7. So the middle segment is row4, columns7-8 and row5, column7.\n\nThe lower segment (rows6-7, columns2-3):\n\nRow6, column2:\n\nUp-left: row5, column1; row4, column0.\n\nDown-left: row7, column1; row8, column0.\n\nRow6, column3:\n\nUp-left: row5, column2; row4, column1; row3, column0.\n\nDown-left: row7, column2; row8, column1; row9, column0.\n\nRow7, column3:\n\nUp-left: row6, column2; row5, column1; row4, column0.\n\nDown-left: row8, column2; row9, column1.\n\nIf we apply this pattern, the output would have new 8s along these diagonals. Let's try to construct the output.\n\nOriginal input 8s are present. The new 8s would be:\n\nFrom upper segment:\n\n- row2, column4:\n\n  - Up-left: row1,3; row0,2.\n\n  - Down-left: row3,3 (existing), row4,2.\n\n- row3, column3:\n\n  - Up-left: row2,2; row1,1; row0,0.\n\n  - Down-left: row4,2; row5,1; row6,0.\n\n- row3, column4:\n\n  - Up-left: row2,3; row1,2; row0,1.\n\n  - Down-left: row4,3; row5,2; row6,1; row7,0.\n\nFrom middle segment:\n\n- row4, column7:\n\n  - Up-left: row3,6; row2,5; row1,4; row0,3.\n\n  - Down-left: row5,6; row6,5; row7,4; row8,3; row9,2.\n\n- row4, column8:\n\n  - Up-left: row3,7; row2,6; row1,5; row0,4.\n\n  - Down-left: row5,7; row6,6; row7,5; row8,4; row9,3.\n\n- row5, column7:\n\n  - Up-left: row4,6; row3,5; row2,4; row1,3; row0,2.\n\n  - Down-left: row6,6; row7,5; row8,4; row9,3.\n\nFrom lower segment:\n\n- row6, column2:\n\n  - Up-left: row5,1; row4,0.\n\n  - Down-left: row7,1; row8,0.\n\n- row6, column3:\n\n  - Up-left: row5,2; row4,1; row3,0.\n\n  - Down-left: row7,2; row8,1; row9,0.\n\n- row7, column3:\n\n  - Up-left: row6,2; row5,1; row4,0.\n\n  - Down-left: row8,2; row9,1.\n\nNow, we need to merge all these new 8s with the original ones. However, in the output of Example0 and Example1, the original vertical segments are retained, and new elements are added around them.\n\nSo, the test output should include all original 8s and the new 8s generated by the diagonals.\n\nLet's list all the new positions:\n\nFrom upper segment:\n\n- row0:2 (from row2,4's up-left), 0 (row3,3's up-left), 1 (row3,4's up-left).\n\nWait, for row3, column4's up-left: row2,3; row1,2; row0,1. So row0,1 would get an 8.\n\nRow0: columns0 (from row3,3's up-left), 1 (row3,4's up-left), 2 (row2,4's up-left), 3 (from row4,8's up-left: row0,4), etc.\n\nThis is getting complicated. To construct the output, perhaps the best way is to simulate each possible new 8 from the diagonals and see which ones are present.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a pattern where each vertical segment causes a diagonal line to form in the output. For example, in Example0's output, the diagonal lines are two: one starting from row0,4 and moving down-left, and another starting from row6,5 and moving down-left. Similarly, in Example1's output, the diagonal starts from row5,0 and moves up-right.\n\nIn the test input, perhaps each vertical segment would generate similar diagonals. For example:\n\nThe upper segment (rows2-3, columns3-4) \u2192 diagonal starts at row0,4 and moves down-left.\n\nThe middle segment (rows4-5, columns7-8) \u2192 diagonal starts at row4,7 and moves down-left.\n\nThe lower segment (rows6-7, columns2-3) \u2192 diagonal starts at row6,2 and moves down-left.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each vertical segment, the diagonal starts at the top of the segment and moves up-left and down-right.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe the pattern is to create diagonal lines that connect the different vertical segments. For example, in Example0, the two vertical segments are connected by a diagonal line. Similarly, in the test input, the upper and lower segments are connected via diagonals.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's difficult. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the training examples.\n\nIn the test input, the vertical segments are in different columns. The output should have diagonal lines extending from each of these segments. For example:\n\nThe upper vertical segment (columns3-4) would generate a diagonal line starting from row0, column5 and moving down-left to row3, column2.\n\nThe middle segment (columns7-8) would generate a diagonal starting from row0, column9 and moving down-left.\n\nThe lower segment (columns2-3) would generate a diagonal starting from row6, column0 and moving down-left.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Looking at the test input and the expected output format, the answer should have 8s arranged in diagonal lines extending from the original vertical segments. Based on Example0 and Example1, the diagonals extend both upwards and downwards from the original segments.\n\nThus, the test output might look like:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut with added 8s in diagonal lines. For example, from the upper segment, adding 8s in row0, column5; row1, column4; row2, column3; row3, column2. Similarly, from the middle segment, adding 8s in row0, column9; row1, column8; etc. And from the lower segment, adding 8s in row8, column0; row9, column-1 (invalid), etc.\n\nBut this is speculative. Given the time, I'll proceed to format the answer based on the examples.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, there's some transformation happening from the input to the output. Let me start by comparing Example 0's input and output.\n\nIn Example 0's input, there are some 7s arranged in certain positions. For instance, the third row has a 7 in position 1 (0-based index?), then the fourth row has two 7s in positions 1 and 2. Then in the fourth and fifth rows, there's a group of 7s towards the right. The output seems to add more 7s around these existing clusters. For example, in the output's first row, there's a 7 in position 4. The second row has a 7 in position 3. Then, the sixth and seventh rows have 7s in positions 5 and 4, respectively. It looks like the existing 7s are being mirrored or rotated in some way.\n\nWait, maybe it's a reflection. Let me check. The original 7s are in certain positions, and the output adds new 7s that form a symmetrical pattern. Looking at Example 0's output, the new 7s form a diagonal line going from the top middle down to the bottom left. Like, starting at row 0, column 4, then row 1 column 3, then row 6 column 5, row 7 column 4, row 8 column 3, row 9 column 2. That seems like a diagonal line from (0,4) to (9,2). But how does that relate to the original input?\n\nHmm, maybe the original clusters are acting as centers for diagonal lines. Let's look at the input clusters. In the input, there's a vertical line of 7s in rows 2-3, column 1-2. Then another cluster in rows 4-5, columns 6-7. The output adds 7s that form diagonals. For the first cluster, maybe it's generating a diagonal line upwards and to the right? Wait, in the output, the first new 7s are in row 0, column 4, and row 1 column 3. That's a diagonal going up-left. Or maybe it's a reflection across some axis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the existing 7s are being extended in some direction. For example, in Example 0's input, the cluster at row 4 and 5 (columns 6 and 7) in the input. The output adds some 7s in the lower part, like row 6 column 5, row 7 column 4, etc. So maybe each cluster is generating a diagonal line moving down and to the left. Similarly, the upper cluster (rows 2-3, columns 1-2) might generate a diagonal moving up and to the right? Let me check.\n\nIn the output, above the original cluster, the first row (row 0) has a 7 at column 4, row 1 column 3. Wait, but the original cluster is in rows 2-3, columns 1-2. So the new 7s are moving upwards and to the right? Because from (2,1) to (0,4) would be moving two rows up and three columns right. That doesn't seem to form a straight line. Maybe the pattern is different.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has clusters of 9s. In the output, those clusters seem to generate diagonal lines extending in both directions. For instance, the input has a cluster in row 1 (columns 3-4) and row 2 (column 4). The output adds 9s in a diagonal going down-left from there. Like row 2 column 9, row 3 column 8, row 4 column 7, etc. Wait, looking at the output of Example 1, the upper cluster (row 1-2) in the input leads to a diagonal that starts at row 1 column 9 (the output's row 1, last element) and goes down-left through row 2 column 8, row 3 column 7, etc., forming a diagonal. Similarly, the lower cluster (rows 6-7) in the input has a diagonal in the output going up-right. So maybe each cluster in the input generates a diagonal line of the same number, either expanding in both directions or creating a mirror.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the upper cluster's diagonal starts at row 1, column 9 (the end of the row) and goes down-left. Similarly, the lower cluster's diagonal starts at row 6 column 3 and perhaps goes up-right. Wait, no. Let me check the output rows:\n\nIn Example 1's output, row 1 has 9,9,0,...,0,9. So the last element is 9. Then row 2 has 9 in column 8 (index 8). Row 3 has 9 in column 6 (index 6?), then row 4 column 5 (index 5?), etc. Wait, maybe each cluster in the input is creating a diagonal line that extends towards the bottom-left and top-right directions, creating a cross shape. But in Example 0, the output adds a diagonal line that starts from the original cluster and extends upwards and downwards.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by rotating the existing clusters by 45 degrees. For example, a vertical line of cells in the input is transformed into a diagonal line in the output. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's input, there's a vertical line of 7s in rows 2 and 3 (columns 1 and 2). The output has a diagonal line starting at row 0, column 4, then row 1, column 3, then rows 2-3 as original, then rows 6-9 columns 5,4,3,2. So that's a diagonal line going through the original vertical cluster, but extended in both directions. Similarly, in Example 1's input, the cluster in row 1 (columns 3-4) and row 2 (column4) is vertical. The output has a diagonal line from row1 column9 to row5 column0 (9's in row1 col9, row2 col8, row3 col7, row4 col6, row5 col5). Wait, but row5's 9 is at column5. So that's a diagonal line from (1,9) to (5,5). Similarly, the other cluster in rows 6-7, columns3-4: the output adds a diagonal line from (6,3) up to (4,5) and down to (5,5)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each cluster in the input (connected cells with the same number) is transformed into a diagonal line that starts from the top-left of the cluster and extends down-right, and another diagonal starting from the top-right and extends down-left, forming an X shape. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the original vertical cluster (columns 1-2, rows 2-3) is still present. But there are new 7s above and below. The new 7s above are in rows 0 and 1, columns 4 and 3. Then below, rows 6-9, columns5,4,3,2. That forms a diagonal line from (0,4) to (9,2). So that's a diagonal line going down-left. Similarly, the cluster on the right (rows4-5, columns6-7) in the input. The output adds 7s below that cluster: row6 column5, row7 column4, etc. So that's also a diagonal line extending down-left. So perhaps each vertical line of numbers is transformed into a diagonal line that extends downwards to the left.\n\nWait, but in Example 1's input, the upper cluster is a vertical line (columns3-4, rows1-2). The output's diagonal for that cluster extends to the right and down. For example, in the output, row1 has a 9 in column9, row2 column8, etc. That's a diagonal moving leftwards each row. So that's a diagonal going down-left from (1,9) to (5,5). But how does that relate to the original cluster's position?\n\nHmm, maybe the original vertical clusters are being copied as diagonal lines extending both upwards and downwards. Let me think again. For Example 0's input cluster (rows2-3, columns1-2), the output adds a diagonal line upwards and to the right (from row2, column1 up to row0 column4?), then a diagonal line downwards and to the left (from row3, column2 down to row9 column2). Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell in the input with a number (non-zero) is the center of a diagonal cross in the output. For instance, each such cell generates a diagonal line going up-left and down-right, etc. But looking at Example 0's input, row2 column1 has 7. In the output, there are 7s in row0 column4, which is two rows up and three columns right. That doesn't form a diagonal. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is rotating the original clusters by 45 degrees. For example, a vertical line becomes a diagonal. Let's see. In Example 0, the original vertical cluster in rows2-3, columns1-2. Rotating that 45 degrees clockwise would make it a diagonal line. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each vertical segment is turned into a diagonal line that's mirrored. For instance, the vertical cluster's length determines the length of the diagonal. In Example 0, the first cluster is two cells high. The output's diagonal for that cluster is two cells long? But the output's diagonal for that cluster extends much longer. Alternatively, the number of cells in the cluster determines how far the diagonal extends.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each vertical cluster in the input is converted into a diagonal line in the output, where the direction depends on the position. For example, clusters on the left side of the grid have their diagonals going towards the upper right, and clusters on the right have diagonals going towards the lower left. But in Example 0, the first cluster is on the left. The output adds a diagonal line that starts above and to the right of it, then goes down-left. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: compare the positions of the original numbers and the added numbers in the output.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first cluster is at (2,1), (3,1), (3,2). The output adds 7s at (0,4), (1,3), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2). Hmm. Let me plot these points. The original cluster is in rows 2-3 and columns 1-2. The added points form a diagonal line that starts at (0,4) and goes down-left each row by one column. From (0,4) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (2,2), but in row2, column2 is part of the original cluster. Then in row6, column5, then 7\u21924, 8\u21923, 9\u21922. That's a diagonal line from (0,4) to (9,2), which is a diagonal of slope -1/1 (each row increases by 1, column decreases by 1). So that's a diagonal line starting at row0, column4 and moving down-left.\n\nSimilarly, the cluster in rows4-5, columns6-7 in the input. The output adds 7s at (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2). Wait, (6,5) is part of the added points. So perhaps each vertical cluster generates a diagonal line in the output that starts from a certain point and moves down-left.\n\nBut how to determine where the diagonal starts and ends. For the first cluster (rows2-3, columns1-2), the diagonal starts at (0,4) and moves down-left. The original cluster is in rows2-3, so maybe the starting point is two rows above and three columns to the right of the cluster's position. Then each step is down one row and left one column. So for each cell in the vertical cluster, perhaps the starting point is calculated based on its position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each vertical line of N cells is transformed into a diagonal line of N cells, but the direction depends on the position. Alternatively, the diagonal lines are added symmetrically around the original cluster.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's output, the original clusters remain unchanged, but new 7s are added in a diagonal pattern around them. For instance, the upper cluster's original 7s are still present, and new 7s form a diagonal line above and below. Similarly, the lower cluster's 7s are still there, with new 7s forming a diagonal line below. Wait, in the output's row6, column5 is 7. Then row7 column4, row8 column3, row9 column2. That's a diagonal line extending from the lower cluster (rows4-5, columns6-7). So from row4, column6 (the start of the cluster) maybe the diagonal starts at row6, column5, which is two rows below and one column left. Then each step is down one and left one.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal starts at the bottom of the original vertical cluster. For the first cluster (rows2-3), the bottom is row3, column1. The diagonal starts two rows below and three columns right. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal starts at the midpoint of the original vertical cluster. For example, the first cluster spans rows2-3. The midpoint is row2.5. The diagonal starts at row0, column4. The vertical distance is 2.5 rows up. Then the horizontal distance is 3 columns right. So each step, perhaps for each row in the vertical cluster, you move a certain number of rows and columns.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to find a pattern between the input and output for each cluster.\n\nIn Example 0, the first cluster in rows2-3, columns1-2. The output adds a diagonal line starting at (0,4) and moving down-left. The original cluster is two cells tall. The new diagonal has four cells: rows0-1, then rows6-9. Wait, maybe the original vertical cluster's height determines the length of the diagonal. But how?\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output is a combination of the original input and some mirrored or rotated version. For example, the input is rotated 90 degrees and overlaid. But looking at Example 0's input and output, the original clusters are still present. So maybe it's adding a rotated version of the input.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation involves reflecting the original clusters across a diagonal axis. For instance, reflecting vertical clusters into diagonal lines. But how?\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the first cluster is a vertical line (two rows, same column). The output's added diagonal line for this cluster is a diagonal line of 7s. So vertical becomes diagonal. Similarly, the other cluster is vertical, and the added line is diagonal.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the upper cluster is a vertical line (two rows, columns3-4 and column4). The output adds a diagonal line of 9s going from row1, column9 down to row5, column5. So that's a diagonal line starting from the right edge. Similarly, the lower cluster (rows6-7, columns3-4) is vertical. The output adds a diagonal line going from row5, column5 up to row3, column7? Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the upper cluster's diagonal starts at row1 column9 (rightmost column) and moves down-left to row5 column5. So it's a diagonal that spans 5 rows and 4 columns. The lower cluster's diagonal starts at row6 column3 and moves up-right to row4 column5, but there's also a 9 in row5 column5. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, each vertical cluster in the input generates two diagonal lines in the output: one going down-left and one going up-right. For example, in Example 0, the first cluster generates a diagonal line upwards and to the right (from row0 col4 to row1 col3) and another line downwards and to the left (row6 col5 to row9 col2). But how are these positions determined?\n\nMaybe the diagonal lines are extensions of the original cluster. For example, if the original cluster is vertical, the diagonal lines are created by moving in opposite directions from the top and bottom of the cluster.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal lines are generated by taking the original vertical cluster and shifting each cell by a certain amount. For instance, each cell in the original vertical cluster contributes to a diagonal line by moving left and down. For example, the cell at (row, col) in the input becomes part of a diagonal at (row + k, col -k) for some k. But this needs to fit the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first cluster: cell (2,1) and (3,1), (3,2). In the output, the diagonal line starts at (0,4). If we take (2,1) and subtract 2 rows and add 3 columns: 2-2=0, 1+3=4. That would get (0,4). Then (3,1) \u2192 3-2=1, 1+2=3 \u2192 (1,3). Similarly, (3,2) \u2192 3-2=1, 2+1=3 \u2192 but (1,3) again. Hmm, but the output has (0,4), (1,3), then the original cells. Then below, (6,5) \u2192 perhaps (4,6) (original cluster) +2 rows, -1 column \u2192 (6,5). Then (5,7) \u2192 (5+2,7-3=4 \u2192 (7,4). But this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the diagonal lines are generated by offsetting the original vertical clusters. For example, for the first cluster in Example 0, the diagonal is shifted 2 rows up and 3 columns right. Then each subsequent cell in the diagonal shifts down-left by 1 row and 1 column. So starting at (0,4), then (1,3), (2,2), etc. But (2,2) is part of the original cluster, so maybe the diagonal continues past it. But in the output, the original cluster is still present, so the new 7s are added around it.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the diagonal line from (0,4) to (9,2) has 7s every step. But in between, the original cluster is also present. So perhaps the transformation is adding a diagonal line that starts at a certain offset from the original cluster and then extends.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation involves creating a diagonal line that is the same length as the original vertical cluster, but positioned in a way that mirrors the original. For example, a vertical cluster of length 2 (rows) becomes a diagonal of length 2. But in Example 0's output, the diagonal line is much longer. So that's probably not it.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation creates diagonal lines that are reflections of the original vertical clusters. For example, a vertical line in the input is reflected across a diagonal axis to become a diagonal line in the output. But I'm not sure how to apply that.\n\nLet me try to look for a different approach. The outputs for both examples have new numbers added in diagonal patterns. The original numbers are preserved. So the pattern is: for each vertical cluster (sequence of same numbers in adjacent rows, same column), add diagonal lines extending from that cluster in specific directions.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: the upper cluster is rows1-2, columns3-4. In the output, there's a diagonal line of 9s starting at row1 column9, then row2 column8, row3 column7, row4 column6, row5 column5. So that's a diagonal line going down-left. Additionally, there's a diagonal line from row6 column3 (part of the lower cluster) up to row4 column5. Wait, the lower cluster in the input is rows6-7, columns3-4. The output has 9s at row5 column5, row4 column6, row3 column7, row2 column8, row1 column9. Wait, but row5 column5 is in the output. So the lower cluster's diagonal goes up-right to row5 column5, then continues to higher rows? Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the upper cluster's diagonal starts at row1 column9 and moves down-left. The lower cluster's diagonal starts at row6 column3 and moves up-right. These two diagonals meet at row5 column5, which has a 9. So perhaps each vertical cluster generates a diagonal line in both directions (up and down), and where they cross, the number is present.\n\nBut how to determine the direction and starting point for each diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, each vertical cluster generates a diagonal line that starts from the top of the cluster and extends to the upper-right and lower-left. For example, the upper cluster in Example 1 is at rows1-2, columns3-4. The diagonal line extends from row1 column9 (top-right) and moves down-left. Similarly, another diagonal from the bottom of the cluster extending down-left. But in the output, there's only one diagonal for that cluster.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that each vertical cluster of number N is replaced by a diagonal line of Ns that starts at the position (original_row - (original_column), 0) or something. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's take the first cluster in Example 0's input: rows2-3, columns1-2. The diagonal in the output starts at row0 column4. The distance between row0 and row2 is 2 rows up. The column distance from column4 to column1 is 3 to the left. So 2 up, 3 right. So maybe for each cell in the vertical cluster, the diagonal line starts at a position that is (row - k, column + k), where k is some value. For example, the top cell of the cluster (row2, column1) is used to start a diagonal line at row0 (2-2) and column4 (1+3). So k=2 rows up and 3 columns right. Then each subsequent cell in the diagonal line steps down-left (row+1, column-1).\n\nBut how is k determined? For Example 0's first cluster, why 2 rows up and 3 columns right?\n\nMaybe k is related to the position of the cluster. For example, for clusters in the left part of the grid, the diagonal lines are shifted more to the right. Alternatively, the diagonal lines are positioned such that they don't overlap with the original cluster. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal line's starting point is determined by the original cluster's row and column. For Example 0's first cluster (row2, column1), the starting point is row0 (2-2) and column4 (1+3). The sum of row and column for the starting point is 0 +4=4, which equals the original row (2) + column (1) +1=4. Maybe that's a pattern. Let's check.\n\nOriginal cell (2,1) \u2192 2+1=3. Starting point (0,4) sum is 4. 3+1=4. For the next cell in the diagonal, (1,3) sum is 4. Then (2,2) sum 4. The original cluster's sum is 3 (2+1), but the starting point sum is 4. So maybe the sum of the starting point's row and column is one more than the original cluster's sum.\n\nIn Example 1's upper cluster: original cells (1,3), (1,4), (2,4). Their sum is 4, 5, 6. The starting point for the diagonal is (1,9) sum 10. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nLet me think of the diagonal line's direction. In Example 0's first cluster, the diagonal line starts at (0,4) and goes down-left. Each step, row increases by 1, column decreases by 1. So the line is (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0), but in the output, after (1,3), the next is (2,2) which is part of the original cluster, then the line continues below at (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2). Wait, that's inconsistent. How does that connect?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are two diagonal lines per cluster. One going up-right and another down-left. For Example 0's first cluster, the upper diagonal is (0,4), (1,3), and the lower starts at (6,5), (7,4), etc.\n\nBut how are these positions determined.\n\nAnother approach: look for the distance from the original cluster to the new diagonal line. For Example 0's first cluster, the new diagonal starts two rows above and three columns to the right. Then, for each step, it moves down and left. So maybe the displacement is (row -2, column +3) for the starting point. Then each step is +1 row, -1 column.\n\nBut why 2 and 3? Maybe it's the number of rows in the original cluster. For a two-row vertical cluster, displacement is 2 rows up and (columns) 3?\n\nNot sure. Let's check another example. In Example 1's upper cluster, the original cluster has two rows (rows1 and 2) in columns3-4. The diagonal starts at row1 column9, which is two columns to the right (from column4 to 9 is 5 columns right), and row1 is the same as the original cluster's row. So displacement is (0 rows, +5 columns). Then the diagonal steps down-left each row. So for row1 column9, then row2 column8, etc. How is the displacement determined here?\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal line starts at the same row as the top of the cluster, but mirrored to the other side of the grid. For Example 0's first cluster starts at row2, column1. The mirrored position would be row2, column (10-1-1)=8 (since it's 0-based and length 10). But 10-1-1=8. But the diagonal starts at column4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the starting column is determined by the row of the cluster. For Example 0's cluster at row2, the starting column is 4 (which is 2*2). Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the diagonal lines are created such that each original vertical cluster's column index becomes the row index of the new diagonal's starting point. For example, in Example 0's first cluster, column1. The new diagonal starts at row0 column4. Not directly related.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to see if there's a pattern in the Test Input and what the expected output would be.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLooking for vertical clusters. The first cluster is in row2, column4 (single 8). Then row3 has two 8s in columns3-4. Another cluster in row4-5, columns7-8. Then row6-7, columns2-3.\n\nSo each of these clusters should generate diagonal lines in the output.\n\nFor example, the cluster in row2, column4. Following the pattern from previous examples, perhaps this single 8 will generate a diagonal line starting two rows up and three columns right (like Example0's first cluster). So row0 (2-2) and column4+3=7. Then the diagonal would go down-left: row0 column7, row1 column6, row2 column5, etc. But row2's original 8 is column4. So maybe adding 8s in these positions.\n\nThe cluster in row3, columns3-4 (two 8s). Following the same logic, maybe start at row1 (3-2), column3+3=6. So row1 column6, then down-left to row2 column5, etc.\n\nThe cluster in row4-5, columns7-8. For row4, column7: start at row2 (4-2), column7+3=10 (but since columns are 0-9, perhaps 9). So row2 column9. Then down-left: row3 column8, row4 column7 (original), row5 column6, etc.\n\nThe cluster in row6-7, columns2-3. For row6, column2: start at row4 (6-2), column2+3=5. So row4 column5. Then down-left: row5 column4, row6 column3 (original), row7 column2, etc.\n\nPutting this all together, the output would have diagonal lines of 8s starting from these new positions and extending down-left. The original clusters would remain, and the new diagonals would be added.\n\nBut I need to verify this against the training examples.\n\nFor Example0's first cluster (rows2-3, columns1-2), the diagonal starts at row0 column4. So yes, row2-2=0, column1+3=4. Then the diagonal steps down-left. So that seems to fit. Similarly, the cluster in row4, column6 (Example0's other cluster) would start at row4-2=2, column6+3=9. But in Example0's output, there's a 7 in row4 column6 (original) and then in row6 column5. So maybe the starting point is row4-2=2, column6+3=9. But in Example0's output, there's no 7 in row2, column9. Hmm, maybe this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the displacement is row - cluster_length, column + cluster_length + 1. For Example0's first cluster (length 2 rows), displacement row0 (2-2=0), column 1 + 2 +1=4. Which fits the starting point row0 column4.\n\nFor Example1's upper cluster (rows1-2, columns3-4). Length is 2 rows. Displacement: row1-2= -1 (but can't be negative). So maybe it's adjusted. Alternatively, displacement is row - cluster_length + 1. For cluster starting at row1, length 2: row1-2+1=0. Column3 +2 +1=6. So starting at row0, column6. But in the output, the diagonal starts at row1 column9. That doesn't match. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look for another pattern. In Example0's output, the new 7s form a diagonal that seems to be a continuation of the original cluster in a different direction. The original vertical clusters become part of a diagonal line that extends in both directions. So maybe each vertical cluster is extended into a diagonal line that moves down-left and up-right.\n\nBut how to determine the length and direction.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by shearing the input such that vertical lines become diagonal lines. For example, a vertical shear transformation. But how to apply that here.\n\nAnother observation: the number of new cells added in the diagonal lines seems to vary. For Example0, the first cluster's diagonal has 4 new cells above and 4 below. But the original cluster was 2 cells. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal lines in the output are mirror images of the original vertical lines. For example, a vertical line in column X is mirrored into a diagonal line that starts at the top in column (9 - X) and moves down-left. But in Example0's first cluster, column1. 9-1=8, but the diagonal starts at column4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal lines are created by taking the original vertical clusters and moving them right by a certain amount and down or up. For example, each vertical cluster is duplicated and shifted right by 3 columns and up by 2 rows, then turned into a diagonal.\n\nBut why 3 and 2?\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal lines are generated by moving each cell in the vertical cluster three columns to the right and two rows up, then creating a diagonal from there.\n\nIn Example0's first cluster: cell (2,1) \u2192 2-2=0, 1+3=4 \u2192 (0,4). Then each subsequent cell in the diagonal steps down-left. So (0,4) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 etc. But (2,2) is part of the original cluster. So the diagonal line includes the original cluster as part of it. But in the output, the original cluster is still present, so the diagonal line is added on top.\n\nBut how does this apply to other clusters.\n\nIn Example0's other cluster, rows4-5, columns6-7. Shifting 2 rows up and 3 columns right would take (4,6) to (2,9). But in the output, the diagonal starts at (6,5). Wait, that's shifting down 2 rows and left 1 column. Not sure.\n\nMaybe the shift is different for each cluster. For example, the first cluster is shifted up and right, the other is shifted down and left. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the shift is determined by the position of the cluster. For example, clusters in the upper half are shifted down and right, and lower half shifted up and left. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, perhaps it's better to look for a rule that can be applied systematically. Given that in Example0's output, the new diagonal for the first cluster starts two rows above and three columns to the right of the original cluster's top cell, then steps down-left each row. Similarly, for the other cluster, the new diagonal starts two rows below and three columns to the left of the cluster's bottom cell, then steps up-right each row. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n\nCluster 1: row2, column4 (single 8). Top cell is (2,4). Shifting up two rows and right three columns gives (0,7). Then the diagonal steps down-left each row: (0,7), (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), etc. But in the original input, there's an 8 in (2,4), so the output would have these new 8s plus the original.\n\nCluster 2: row3, columns3-4 (two 8s). Top cell is (3,3). Shifting up two rows and right three columns: (1,6). Then diagonal steps down-left: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), etc. \n\nCluster3: rows4-5, columns7-8. Bottom cell is (5,8). Shifting down two rows and left three columns: (7,5). Then steps up-right: (7,5), (6,6), (5,7), (4,8), etc. But wait, the original cluster is in rows4-5, columns7-8. So (5,8) is the bottom cell. Shifting down two rows (5+2=7) and left three columns (8-3=5) gives (7,5). Then the diagonal would step up-right each row: (7,5) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,7) \u2192 (4,8), etc. So the diagonal line would have 8s at (7,5), (6,6), (5,7), (4,8), etc.\n\nCluster4: rows6-7, columns2-3. Top cell is (6,2). Shifting up two rows and right three columns: (4,5). Then steps down-left: (4,5) \u2192 (5,4) \u2192 (6,3) \u2192 (7,2), etc. The original cluster is at (6,2-3), so (6,3) is part of the original.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input, the output would have new diagonals for each cluster:\n\n- For row2, column4: diagonal from (0,7) down-left.\n\n- For row3, columns3-4: diagonal from (1,6) down-left.\n\n- For rows4-5, columns7-8: diagonal from (7,5) up-right.\n\n- For rows6-7, columns2-3: diagonal from (4,5) down-left.\n\nBut also, the original clusters remain.\n\nLet's sketch the output:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0] (from cluster1's diagonal starting at (0,7))\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0] (from cluster2's diagonal at (1,6))\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0] (original 8) + (2,5) from cluster1 and (2,5) from cluster2's diagonal.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0] (original) + (3,4) from cluster2's diagonal.\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0] (from cluster3's diagonal (4,8), and cluster4's diagonal (4,5))\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0] (from cluster2's diagonal (5,4), cluster3's diagonal (5,7))\n\nRow6: [0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0] (original) + (6,3) from cluster4's diagonal.\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0] (original 8 in (7,3)) + cluster3's diagonal (7,5).\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (maybe cluster3's diagonal continues here?)\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but this is a rough sketch. Also, the cluster3's diagonal starts at (7,5) and goes up-right to (6,6), (5,7), (4,8), (3,9) but column9 is out of bounds for row3. So maybe (5,7) and (4,8) are valid.\n\nPutting all together, the output would have 8s in:\n\nRow0: column7.\n\nRow1: column6.\n\nRow2: column5 and column4.\n\nRow3: columns3,4, and maybe 4 from diagonal.\n\nRow4: columns5 (from cluster4),8.\n\nRow5: columns4,7.\n\nRow6: columns3 (original),5 (cluster4's diagonal).\n\nRow7: columns3 (original),5.\n\nRow8: ?\n\nRow9: ?\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. The expected output would need to be formatted in the same way as the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each vertical cluster generates a diagonal line that starts at a certain point and extends in both directions. But this is getting too vague.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, another observation: the diagonal lines in the output seem to form a 'wave' pattern. In Example0's output, the new 7s are arranged in a diagonal that starts at the top, moves down-left through the original clusters, then continues below. Similarly, in Example1's output, the 9s form a diagonal that starts at the top-right and moves down-left.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that each non-zero number in the input is part of a vertical line, and the output adds a diagonal line moving down-left from the top of each vertical line and up-right from the bottom, forming a larger X shape.\n\nFor the Test Input, each vertical cluster would generate such diagonals. For example, the cluster in row2, column4 (8) would have a diagonal starting two rows above and three columns to the right (0,7) and moving down-left. Similarly, the cluster in row3, columns3-4 would start at row1, column6 and move down-left. The cluster in rows4-5, columns7-8 would start at row7, column5 and move up-right. The cluster in rows6-7, columns2-3 would start at row4, column5 and move down-left.\n\nPutting all these together, the output would have new 8s along these diagonals, creating a pattern similar to the training examples.\n\nGiven the complexity, the answer would likely follow this pattern: for each vertical cluster, add a diagonal line of the same number extending down-left and up-right from the cluster. The exact starting points and directions would need to be determined based on the examples.\n\nAfter all this analysis, I'll proceed to construct the output for the test input based on the observed patterns from the training examples.",
