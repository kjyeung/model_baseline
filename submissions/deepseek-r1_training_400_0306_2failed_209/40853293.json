        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids based on the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the training examples to understand the pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has several numbers like 2, 3, 6, 5, 8. The output seems to have more of those numbers spread out. For instance, in the input, there's a 2 in the third row, sixth column. In the output, that 2 is still there, but there are multiple 2s in the same column below and above. Wait, looking at row 6 (index 6) in the input, there's a 3 in column 3 and another 3 in column 11. In the output, those 3s are connected horizontally, forming a line of 3s. Similarly, the 5s in row 20 (input) are in columns 2 and 7, and in the output, they spread to adjacent columns. \n\nSo maybe the pattern is that each number creates a horizontal line extending to the left and right until it hits another number or the edge. But wait, in the first example's output, the 2 in the third row, sixth column, creates a vertical line of 2s. Wait, in the input, that 2 is alone, but in the output, the entire column from row 2 to row 13 (approximately) is filled with 2s. Similarly, the 8 in row 12 (input) becomes a vertical line downward in the output. The 6 in row 18 (input) is in column 4, and in the output, that column becomes a vertical line of 6s.\n\nWait, but in the output, the 2 in example 0's third row has 2s below and above. Wait, no. Let me check again. The input has a 2 at (2,6). The output has rows 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 in column 6 as 2s. So that's a vertical line. Similarly, the 3s in row 6 (columns 3 and 11) in the input become a horizontal line connecting them, and also vertical lines. Wait, the output for row 6 has 3s from column 3 to 11. So it's like the numbers are filling in between the same numbers horizontally if they are aligned, but vertically as well. Hmm, maybe it's that each number creates a cross (vertical and horizontal lines) from its position until blocked by another number.\n\nLooking at example 0's 3s: in input row 6, columns 3 and 11. In output, row 6 has 3s from column 3 to 11, forming a horizontal line. Also, each 3's column (columns 3 and 11) have vertical lines. Wait, no. In output row 6, column 3 is 3, and rows 6's columns 4,5, etc., up to 11 are 3. But vertically, for column 3, the output has 3s in row 6, but the rows above and below might not be. Wait, in output row 6, column 3 is part of a horizontal line of 3s. Then, in rows 7,8, etc., in column 3, there's 0. Wait, maybe the horizontal and vertical expansion is only for certain numbers. Alternatively, maybe each number creates a vertical line downward and a horizontal line to the right, but that doesn't fit exactly.\n\nLooking at the second example, Example 1. Input has a 4 in row 2, column 3. The output has a vertical line of 4s in column 3 from row 2 down to row 10. Also, in row 4, there's a 3 in column 2 and 7. In the output, those 3s form a horizontal line connecting them, but also the 4's column is filled. Then, the 7s in row 8, columns 2 and 5. In the output, they form horizontal lines (7,4,7,7?), perhaps merging with the 4's vertical line. The 9 in row 12 and 18, column 5. In the output, there's a vertical line of 9s in column 5 from row 12 to 18. The 8 in row 14, column 1 becomes a horizontal line and vertical line, but in the output, it's part of a cross with 9s.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is: for each number in the input, create a vertical line (up and down) and a horizontal line (left and right) from that number's position, changing all 0s along the way to that number, until another non-zero number is encountered. But how do overlapping numbers work? For example, in Example 1's row 4, the 3s are connected via horizontal line, but also the 4's vertical line is present. So the 4 in column 3 is vertical, and the 3s in row 4 are horizontal, overlapping at column 3. In the output, that cell is 4, which suggests that the vertical line takes precedence, or maybe the higher number? Because 4 is higher than 3, and the cell becomes 4. Or maybe the latest processed number overwrites. Alternatively, maybe the vertical lines are processed before horizontal, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical line is drawn first, then the horizontal line, and overlapping areas take the number from the last drawn. But this seems arbitrary. Let's check Example 1's row 4, column 3. The input has 0, but in the output it's 4. So the 4's vertical line (column 3) passes through row 4, and the 3's horizontal line (row 4) would have filled column 3. But since the 4's vertical line is there, maybe vertical lines take precedence. Alternatively, the order of processing numbers could affect this. For instance, if 4 is processed before 3, then when 3's horizontal line is drawn, it can't overwrite the 4 in column 3. \n\nSo the process could be:\n\n1. For each cell in the input grid, if it's a non-zero number, draw vertical lines (up and down) from that cell, changing all 0s to that number until another non-zero is hit.\n\n2. Then, for each cell in the input grid, draw horizontal lines (left and right), again changing 0s to that number, but not overwriting existing non-zero numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps vertical and horizontal lines are drawn for each number, in some order, and overlapping areas take the higher number. Or maybe vertical lines are done first, then horizontal. \n\nLooking at Example 1, the 4 in row 2, column 3 creates a vertical line from row 2 to 10 in column 3. The 3s in row 4, columns 2 and 7. Their horizontal lines would go from column 2 to 7, but in column 3, there's already a 4 from the vertical line. So the horizontal line for 3s in row 4 would create 3s from column 2 to 7, but column 3 remains 4 because it's already filled. Hence, in the output, row 4, column 3 is 4, and the rest of the row has 3s. So the vertical line (4) was drawn first, then the horizontal line (3) but can't overwrite the existing 4. So the order of processing is important. \n\nThis suggests that vertical lines are drawn first for all numbers, then horizontal lines. Alternatively, maybe each number's vertical lines are drawn first, then their horizontal lines. Or perhaps all vertical lines are drawn first, followed by all horizontal lines.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the processing is done in such a way that when a number is placed, both vertical and horizontal expansions happen, but in the order that higher numbers override lower ones. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: for each number in the input, expand vertically (up and down) as far as possible, then expand horizontally (left and right) as far as possible. But when expanding, only overwrite 0s, not existing numbers.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n- For each cell in the input grid:\n\n   - If the cell is non-zero, expand vertically in both directions (up and down) from that cell, setting all 0s in the same column to that number until a non-zero cell is encountered.\n\n   - Then, expand horizontally in both directions (left and right) from that cell (including the vertically expanded cells?), setting all 0s in the same row to that number until a non-zero cell is encountered.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's test this with example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2 is in row 2, column 6. When expanding vertically, all cells in column 6 (from row 2 down to row 13) become 2. Then, for each of those cells in column 6, expand horizontally. So each cell in column 6 would spread left and right. But in the output, the 2s in column 6 don't spread horizontally. Wait, but in the output, row 6 (original input has 3s in columns 3 and 11), the 3s spread horizontally. So perhaps the vertical expansion is done first, then horizontal, but only from the original input positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero cell in the input first expands vertically, then horizontally, but not considering the cells that were filled during the vertical expansion as new sources for horizontal expansion.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFor each original non-zero cell in the input:\n\n1. Expand vertically (up and down) as far as possible, changing 0s to the cell's value.\n\n2. Expand horizontally (left and right) as far as possible from the original cell's position, changing 0s to the cell's value.\n\nBut in Example 0, the 2 in row 2, column 6:\n\n- Vertical expansion fills column 6 from row 2 down to row 13 (based on output rows 2-13 in column 6 being 2).\n\n- Then horizontal expansion from (2,6) would spread left and right in row 2. But in the output, row 2's column 6 is 2, and the rest are 0. So that's not happening. So maybe the horizontal expansion is only done after vertical, but from the original cell's position. Wait, maybe the horizontal expansion is only done on the original row of the cell, not the vertically expanded cells.\n\nAlternatively, the process is:\n\nFor each original cell with a number:\n\n- Expand vertically up and down, changing 0s to that number.\n\n- Then expand horizontally left and right from the original cell's position, changing 0s to that number, but not considering the vertical expansion's cells as part of the horizontal expansion.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's 3s in row 6, columns 3 and 11. After vertical expansion, each 3 would fill their columns. Then horizontal expansion would spread left and right from row 6, columns 3 and 11. So from column 3, spread left and right in row 6, changing 0s to 3. Similarly for column 11. So the horizontal line connects the two 3s in row 6. That explains why in the output, row 6 has 3s from column 3 to 11. Because the original 3s are at 3 and 11 in row 6, their horizontal expansions meet in the middle.\n\nSimilarly, the 5s in row 20, columns 2 and 7. Vertical expansion would fill their columns, then horizontal expansion from each original position. So the horizontal expansion would spread left and right from columns 2 and 7 in row 20, which would merge into a single line if they meet. But in the output, row 20 (index 20) has 5s in columns 2-7. So the horizontal expansions from columns 2 and 7 in row 20 meet and fill the entire line between them.\n\nSo this seems to fit. The process is:\n\nFor each number in the input:\n\n1. Expand vertically (up and down) from the cell's position, filling 0s with the number until a non-zero is hit.\n\n2. Expand horizontally (left and right) from the cell's original position, filling 0s with the number until a non-zero is hit.\n\nBut when two numbers' horizontal expansions meet, they overwrite each other? No, because in Example 0's row 6, the 3s from columns 3 and 11 expand horizontally and meet in the middle. So all cells between 3 and 11 in row 6 become 3. That suggests that when expanding horizontally from the original positions, they can fill the entire row between them if there are no other numbers blocking.\n\nWait, but if two different numbers are expanding towards each other, how is that handled? For example, if a 3 is expanding right and a 4 is expanding left. But in the training examples, perhaps all numbers in the same row that are expanding horizontally are the same, so they merge.\n\nIn Example 1's input, row 4 has 3s in columns 2 and 7. Their horizontal expansions would fill the entire row between them with 3s. But in the output, row 4 has 3s from columns 2 to 7, except column 3 which is 4. Because the vertical expansion of the 4 in column 3 (from row 2) fills that column, so when the horizontal expansion of the 3s occurs, they can't overwrite the existing 4 in column 3. So in row 4, columns 2-7 are 3s except column 3 is 4.\n\nThis suggests that vertical expansions are done first, then horizontal expansions. Because the vertical 4 in column 3 was already placed before the horizontal 3s, so the 3s can't overwrite it. So the order is important: vertical first, then horizontal.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each non-zero cell in the input:\n\n   a. Expand vertically (up and down) from that cell, changing all 0s in the same column to the cell's value, stopping when a non-zero is encountered.\n\n2. For each non-zero cell in the input:\n\n   b. Expand horizontally (left and right) from that cell, changing all 0s in the same row to the cell's value, stopping when a non-zero is encountered.\n\nBut note that during the vertical expansion, cells are filled, and during horizontal expansion, the original cell's row is considered. So in Example 1, the 4 in row 2, column 3 expands vertically down to row 10. Then, when expanding horizontally from the original 4's position (row 2, column 3), it would spread left and right. But in the input, there are no other numbers in row 2, columns 0-3, so the horizontal expansion would fill from column 3 left to column 0? But in the output for row 2, the 4 is only in column 3. So that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the 4 is at row 2, column 3. So during vertical expansion, column 3 is filled from row 2 down to row 10. Then, during horizontal expansion from row 2, column 3, it would spread left and right in row 2. But the input row 2 has 0s in columns 0-3. So after vertical expansion, column 3 is filled. Then horizontal expansion would fill row 2, columns left and right from 3. But in the output, row 2's columns are 0 except column 3 is 4. That suggests that horizontal expansion doesn't happen for the 4. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe horizontal expansion only happens if there are multiple cells in the same row. Wait, but in Example 0's 3s in row 6, columns 3 and 11. Each 3's horizontal expansion would spread from their original positions. So from column 3, expanding left and right, and from column 11, expanding left and right. They meet in the middle. So the entire row between them is filled with 3s.\n\nBut in Example 1's 4 in row 2, column 3. After vertical expansion, column 3 is filled from row 2 to 10. Then, during horizontal expansion, the 4's original cell (row 2, column 3) would expand left and right. But since there are no other numbers in row 2, columns 0-3 are 0s. So the horizontal expansion would fill row 2 from column 3 to left and right. But in the output, row 2 is still only 4 in column 3. So this doesn't align. That suggests that horizontal expansion isn't happening for the 4. \n\nHmm, perhaps the horizontal expansion is only done for cells that are part of a horizontal pair. Or maybe there's another rule. Alternatively, maybe the horizontal expansion is done only if there's another number in the same row. For example, in Example 0, the 3s in row 6 are two cells. Their horizontal expansions connect them. But the 4 in Example 1's row 2 is alone, so no horizontal expansion. So the rule might be: if there are multiple numbers in the same row, expand horizontally to connect them. Otherwise, only expand vertically.\n\nBut how to determine which cells to connect. Alternatively, perhaps for each number, regardless of other numbers, during the horizontal expansion phase, expand left and right from their original position. So even if a single cell, it would expand as far as possible. But in Example 1's 4, after vertical expansion, the horizontal expansion would spread left and right. However, the input's row 2, column 3 is 4, and the rest are 0. So during horizontal expansion, row 2 would have 4s from column 0 to the end? But in the output, row 2's column 3 is the only 4. That's not happening, so this theory is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the horizontal expansion is done only between numbers of the same value. So for example, if there are two 3s in the same row, their horizontal expansions connect them. But a single 4 would only expand vertically. Let's check the examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the 3s in row 6 are two 3s. Their horizontal expansions connect them. The 2 is a single cell, so only vertical expansion. The 8s are two in row 12 and 17 (input) which might connect vertically and horizontally. But in Example 0's output, the 8s form a vertical line. So maybe for numbers that are alone, only vertical expansion is done, and horizontal is done only if there are multiple same numbers in the same row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the horizontal expansion is done regardless, but the presence of other numbers in the row (even different) blocks it. For example, in Example 1's row 4, the two 3s expand horizontally, but the 4 in column 3 blocks them. But how do they connect past the 4?\n\nWait, in Example 1's row 4, the original 3s are in columns 2 and 7. When expanding horizontally from each, they would spread left and right. From column 2, expanding right to column 7 (but the 4 is in column 3). Wait, but during horizontal expansion, the 3 in column 2 would spread right until it hits a non-zero. The first non-zero is column 3's 4 (from vertical expansion). So the 3 can't expand past column 2. Similarly, the 3 in column 7 expands left until column 3's 4. But in the output, row 4 has 3s from columns 2 to 7, including column 3's 4. Wait, no. In the output, row 4 is [0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]. So the 3s are in columns 2,4,5,6,7. The 4 is in column 3. So how does that happen? \n\nAh, perhaps the horizontal expansion from column 2's 3 goes right but stops at column 3 (4), so only column 2. Then the expansion from column 7's 3 goes left and stops at column 3 (4). But that would leave columns 2 and 7 as 3s, with column 3 as 4. But the output shows columns 2 and 4-7 as 3. How does column 4 get filled?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the horizontal expansion. Perhaps the horizontal expansion is done for each cell in the original input, but during horizontal expansion, if two cells of the same number are in the same row and their horizontal expansions meet, they form a continuous line. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the horizontal expansion is done after the vertical expansion. So the vertical lines are filled first, then in the horizontal phase, each original cell's row is processed, connecting any cells of the same number. For example, in Example 0's row 6, there are two 3s. After vertical expansion, their columns are filled. Then, during horizontal expansion, the 3s in row 6 are connected, creating a horizontal line between them, even if there are other numbers in between. But in Example 1's row 4, the two 3s are separated by a 4 (from vertical expansion), so their horizontal expansions can't connect. But in the output, the 3s are connected. Wait, in the output for Example 1's row 4, the 3s are in columns 2,4,5,6,7, with column 3 being 4. So the 3s are not connected. Wait, but columns 2 and 4-7 have 3s. So between column 2 and 4, there's a gap (column 3 is 4). So they aren't connected. So perhaps the horizontal expansion from the 3s in columns 2 and 7 can't reach each other because of the 4 in column 3. \n\nSo how do the 3s in columns 2 and 7 expand? The 3 in column 2 would expand right until column 3 (4) blocks it. So columns 2-2 (only itself). The 3 in column 7 expands left until column 3's 4, which is columns 3 to 7? No. Wait, expanding left from column 7 would go to column 6,5, etc., but if column 3 is a 4, then columns 4,5,6 would be 0s during horizontal expansion. So the 3 in column 7 can expand left to column 4 (since those are 0s), changing them to 3. But during horizontal expansion, after vertical expansion, column 3 is already 4. So during horizontal expansion from column 7's 3, moving left, the cells to the left are 0s until column 3 (4). So columns 4,5,6,7 would be filled with 3s. Similarly, expanding from column 2's 3 to the right, it would fill columns 2-3, but column 3 is 4, so only column 2. \n\nSo the result would be columns 2 (3), 3 (4), and 4-7 (3). Which matches the output. So this makes sense. \n\nSo the process is:\n\n1. Vertical expansion: For each cell in the input, expand vertically up and down, filling 0s with the cell's number until a non-zero is hit.\n\n2. Horizontal expansion: For each cell in the input, expand horizontally left and right, filling 0s with the cell's number until a non-zero is hit.\n\nBut during horizontal expansion, the cells that were filled during vertical expansion are considered non-zero and thus block the expansion.\n\nSo the order is vertical first, then horizontal. \n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nLet's look at the test input:\n\nThe input is a grid of 20 rows. Let's note the non-zero cells:\n\nRow 1: column 3 is 3.\n\nRow 2: column 9 is 5.\n\nRow 3: column 1 is 2, column 16 is 2.\n\nRow 7: column 7 is 7, column 13 is7.\n\nRow 9: column 9 is5.\n\nRow14: column 8 is8, column14 is8.\n\nRow18: column3 is3.\n\nSo the non-zero cells are:\n\n(1,3)=3\n\n(2,9)=5\n\n(3,1)=2, (3,16)=2\n\n(7,7)=7, (7,13)=7\n\n(9,9)=5\n\n(14,8)=8, (14,14)=8\n\n(18,3)=3\n\nNow, first, perform vertical expansion for each of these cells.\n\nFor (1,3)=3: expand up and down column3. Let's see:\n\nRow 1, column3 is 3. Going up, there's row0, which is 0. So row0, column3 becomes3. But wait, the input starts from row0 perhaps. Wait, the test input has rows 0 to 19 (20 rows). Let's index them as 0-19.\n\nWait, the test input is given as 20 rows, each starting with [0,...]. Let's assume they are rows 0 to 19.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 1 (index1), column3 is3.\n\nVertical expansion: move up (row0, column3): 0 \u2192 becomes3.\n\nThen down: row2, column3: 0 \u2192 becomes3. Continue until a non-zero is hit. For example, row3, column3: 0 \u21923. Row4, column3: 0\u21923. Continue until row18, column3 is3 (from input). Wait, row18 has a 3 in column3 (input cell (18,3)=3). So the vertical expansion from row1, column3 would go down to row18, but row18's column3 is already3. So the vertical expansion from row1's3 would fill rows0 to17, column3 with3. But row18's3 is part of another cell, which will also expand vertically.\n\nSo first, vertical expansion for (1,3)=3:\n\nUp: rows0, column3 \u21923.\n\nDown: rows2-17, column3 \u21923. Row18's column3 is3 (input's row18), which is non-zero, so stop at row17.\n\nThen vertical expansion for (18,3)=3:\n\nUp: rows17 down to row18's column3. But row17, column3 is3 (from previous vertical expansion), so no change. Down: row19, column3 \u21923.\n\nSo after vertical expansion for 3s:\n\nColumn3 has 3s from row0 to row19, except for row18's original3 and row1's original3, but because of vertical expansion from both (row1 and row18's3), they merge.\n\nNext, (2,9)=5. Vertical expansion: column9, rows above and below. Let's see:\n\nRow2, column9 is5. Up: rows0-1, column9 \u21925. Down: rows3-19, column9 \u21925, until a non-zero is hit. The next non-zero in column9 is row9, column9=5. So from row2 to row9, column9. So rows2-9, column9 become5. Then row9's5 will also expand vertically.\n\nBut during vertical expansion for row2's5:\n\nRow2's5 expands down to row9. Then row9's5 will expand up and down. But since row9's5 is part of the input, when processing it, during vertical expansion, it will expand from row9's5: up to row9 (since rows2-9 are already5), and down to row19. So rows9-19, column9 become5.\n\nSo combining these, column9 has 5s from row0 (from row2's vertical expansion up?), no, row2's vertical expansion up is rows0-1. Row2's down expansion is rows3-9. Then row9's vertical expansion up is rows9's original5, which is already filled by row2's expansion. Row9's vertical expansion down is rows10-19. So column9 ends up as 5s from row0 to row19.\n\nWait, row2's5 expands up to row0 and 1, down to rows3-9. Then row9's5 (input) expands up (already 5s) and down from 9 to 19. So column9 is 5s from row0 to row19.\n\nNext, (3,1)=2: vertical expansion. Column1:\n\nRow3, column1 is2. Up: rows0-2, column1 \u21922. Down: rows4-19, column1 \u21922, until non-zero. No other 2s in column1. So column1 becomes2 from row3 to row19. Wait, no, vertical expansion from row3's2: up to row0-2, column1 becomes2. Down to rows4-19, column1 becomes2. So entire column1 is 2s.\n\nSimilarly, (3,16)=2: column16, row3. Up: rows0-2, column16 \u21922. Down: rows4-19, column16 \u21922. So column16 becomes 2s from row0 to row19.\n\nThen (7,7)=7 and (7,13)=7. Vertical expansion for each.\n\nFor (7,7)=7: column7, rows0-6 and 8-19. But row7's7 expands up and down. So rows0-6, column7 \u21927. Rows8-19, column7 \u21927.\n\nSimilarly, (7,13)=7: column13, rows0-6, 8-19 \u21927.\n\nThen (9,9)=5 is already part of column9's vertical expansion, which is all 5s.\n\n(14,8)=8 and (14,14)=8. Vertical expansion for each:\n\nFor (14,8)=8: column8. Up: rows0-13, column8 \u21928. Down: rows15-19, column8 \u21928.\n\nFor (14,14)=8: column14. Up: rows0-13, column14 \u21928. Down: rows15-19, column14 \u21928.\n\nSo after vertical expansion, columns8 and14 are filled with 8s.\n\nNow, horizontal expansion for each original cell:\n\nStarting with row1, column3's3. Now, during horizontal expansion, expand left and right from (1,3). The row is row1. After vertical expansion, row1's column3 is3. Other columns in row1 are 0s (except any filled by other vertical expansions). But during vertical expansion, other columns may have been filled. For example, column1 has 2s from row3's vertical expansion. So row1's column1 is2. So during horizontal expansion for (1,3)=3:\n\nIn row1, columns left and right of 3. Columns0-2 are 0 except column1 is2. So expanding left from3, column3 is3, column2 is0 \u2192 becomes3. Column1 is2 (non-zero) \u2192 stop. So left expansion stops at column2. Right expansion: columns4-19 are0. So expand right until non-zero. But after vertical expansion, any columns in row1 may have numbers. For example, column9 has5 from vertical expansion. So row1, column9 is5. So during horizontal expansion for row1, column3's3:\n\nLeft to column2 (3), right to column8 (since column9 is5). So row1's columns2-8 become3. But wait, during vertical expansion, column3 is3. During horizontal expansion, we start from column3 and expand left and right.\n\nWait, no. Horizontal expansion is from the original cell's position. Original cell is (1,3)=3. So during horizontal expansion, we process row1, starting at column3, and expand left and right, changing 0s to3 until a non-zero is hit. But other columns in row1 may have been filled by vertical expansions.\n\nIn row1, after vertical expansion:\n\n- column1 is2 (from row3's vertical expansion).\n\n- column3 is3 (from vertical expansion).\n\n- column9 is5 (from row2's vertical expansion).\n\nOther columns are0.\n\nSo during horizontal expansion for (1,3)=3:\n\nLeft: column2 is0 \u21923. column1 is2 (non-zero) \u2192 stop. So left expansion covers column3-2.\n\nRight: columns4-8 are0 \u2192 fill with3. Column9 is5 (non-zero) \u2192 stop. So right expansion covers columns4-8. So row1's columns2-8 become3. But columns1 and9 remain as2 and5.\n\nSo row1 becomes: [0, 2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,5, ...].\n\nNext, (2,9)=5. Original cell is row2, column9. After vertical expansion, column9 is5. During horizontal expansion, expand left and right from column9. Row2's columns0-8 are0 (except any vertical expansions). For example, column3 is3 (from row1's vertical expansion). So during horizontal expansion for (2,9)=5:\n\nLeft: columns8,7,...,0. Each is0 until a non-zero is hit. In row2, column3 is3 (from row1's vertical expansion). So expanding left from column9, we can't go past column3. Wait, no. The horizontal expansion is done after vertical expansions, so in row2, column3 is3 (from row1's vertical expansion). So during horizontal expansion from column9, left expansion would start at column9 and move left. Columns8,7, etc., are0. So expand left until column3's3. So columns8 to4 are0 \u2192 filled with5. Column3 is3 \u2192 stop. So row2's columns4-9 become5. Columns0-3: column3 is3, others0. So row2's columns4-9 are5.\n\nThen (3,1)=2. Horizontal expansion from row3, column1. Expand left and right. Row3's columns0 and 2-19 are0 (except vertical expansions). Column16 has2 from vertical expansion. So during horizontal expansion for (3,1)=2:\n\nLeft: column0 is0 \u21922.\n\nRight: columns2-15 are0 (except column3 is3, which is from row1's vertical expansion). So expanding right from column1, column2 is0 \u21922. Column3 is3 \u2192 stop. So columns0-2 become2. Column3 remains3. Columns4-16: column16 is2 (from vertical expansion of row3's 16). So during horizontal expansion from column1, the right expansion stops at column3. Then, the horizontal expansion from column16's original cell (3,16)=2 would expand left and right. For row3, column16=2. Expand left until non-zero. Columns15,14,... are0 until column3's3. So columns4-16 (original column16's expansion left) would become2. But column3 is3, so columns4-16 become2. So after both expansions, row3's columns0-2 are2, column3 is3, columns4-16 are2, column17-19 are0. But this needs to be checked.\n\nWait, for (3,1)=2 and (3,16)=2, their horizontal expansions would be processed separately.\n\nFirst, (3,1)=2:\n\n- Expand left from column1: column0 becomes2.\n\n- Expand right from column1: columns2-15 (since column3 is3, which is non-zero). So columns2-15 become2? No, because during expansion, the code would check each cell to the right until a non-zero is found. Column3 is3 (non-zero), so expanding right from column1 would go to column2 (0 \u21922), then column3 is3 \u2192 stop. So right expansion from column1 would cover columns1-2. Then, (3,16)=2's horizontal expansion:\n\n- Expand left from column16: columns15-4 (since column3 is3). Columns4-15 are0 \u2192 filled with2. Column3 is3 \u2192 stop. So columns4-16 become2. Columns17-19 remain0.\n\nSo row3 becomes:\n\ncolumns0-2:2, column3:3, columns4-16:2, columns17-19:0.\n\nBut the original input's row3 has 2 at columns1 and16. So after vertical and horizontal expansion, row3's columns0-2 are2 (from column1's expansion), column3 is3, columns4-16 are2 (from column16's expansion).\n\nSo the entire row3 would be [2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0]. Wait, columns17-19 are0? Or up to column16. Let me check:\n\nRow3's columns are 0-19. So after (3,1)=2's horizontal expansion: columns0-2 are2. Column3 is3. (3,16)=2's horizontal expansion: expand left to column4, then to column3? No. Because (3,16)=2 is in column16. Expanding left from column16, moving left. Columns15,14,... until column3's3. So columns4-16 become2. Column3 is3, so expansion stops. So row3's columns4-16 become2. Columns17-19 are0. So row3 becomes:\n\n[2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nBut the original row3's columns1 and16 were2. After vertical expansion, columns1 and16 are filled. Then horizontal expansion from columns1 and16. \n\nMoving on to (3,16)=2: after vertical expansion, column16 is filled with2s. Horizontal expansion: from column16, expand left and right. Left: columns15-0. But during horizontal expansion, left expansion from column16 would change columns15,14,... until a non-zero. In row3, column3 is3. So columns4-16 are2, column3 is3. So expanding left from column16, columns4-16 become2. Columns3 is3 \u2192 stop.\n\nSo row3's columns4-16 are filled with2s from horizontal expansion of column16's original 2.\n\nNext, (7,7)=7 and (7,13)=7. Let's process their horizontal expansions.\n\nFor (7,7)=7: during horizontal expansion, expand left and right from column7. Row7's columns after vertical expansion:\n\ncolumn7 is7 (original), column13 is7 (from vertical expansion). Wait, vertical expansion of (7,7)=7 would make column7 filled with7 from rows0-6 and8-19. But during vertical expansion, row7's7 is the original cell. So during horizontal expansion in row7, columns0-6 and8-19 may have been filled by other vertical expansions.\n\nBut let's focus on row7. After vertical expansion, row7's columns7 and13 are7 (from original cells). Other columns may have numbers from vertical expansions. For example, column3 is3 (from row1's vertical expansion). Column9 is5 (from vertical expansion). Column14 is8 (from vertical expansion of row14's8). \n\nSo during horizontal expansion for (7,7)=7:\n\nExpand left from7: columns6,5,... are0 until non-zero. For example, column3 is3. So columns4-6 are0 \u2192 filled with7. Column3 is3 \u2192 stop. So left expansion from7 covers columns4-7. Right expansion: columns8-12 are0 (except column9 is5). So expand from7 to the right until column13 (which is7). So columns7-13 would be filled with7, but column9 is5. So during expansion, when encountering column9's5, the expansion stops. So expanding right from7: columns8-12 are0 \u2192 filled with7. Column13 is7 (original cell), which is same value. So the horizontal expansion from (7,7)=7 would cover columns4-7 (left) and columns8-12 (right). Then, the horizontal expansion from (7,13)=7 would expand left and right. \n\nFor (7,13)=7: expand left from13. Columns12-8 are0 (except column9 is5). So expand left to columns8-13. Column9 is5 \u2192 stops. So columns8-13 become7. Column9 is5, which is in between. So the result for row7:\n\ncolumns4-7:7, columns8-12:7, column13:7. column9 is5. So row7's columns4-12 (except column9) and column13 are7. column9 is5. \n\nSo row7 would look like:\n\n[...,4,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,...] (columns4-7:7; columns8-12:7, except column9=5; column13=7).\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Let's see:\n\nOriginal cells (7,7) and (7,13) are both7. During horizontal expansion:\n\nFor (7,7)=7: expand left to column4, and right to column12. So columns4-12, except column9 (5), become7. Then (7,13)=7: expand left to column13-1 (12), but those are already7. So no change. So row7's columns4-12 (except column9=5) are7. Column13 is7.\n\nSo the row becomes: columns0-3:0 (except column3=3), columns4-7=7, column8=7, column9=5, columns10-13=7.\n\nThen, (9,9)=5's horizontal expansion: row9, column9. After vertical expansion, column9 is5. Horizontal expansion: left and right. In row9, columns0-8 and10-19 are0 (except vertical expansions). For example, column3 is3, column9 is5. So expanding left from9: columns8,7,... until non-zero. Column3 is3. So columns4-8 are0 \u2192 filled with5. column3 is3 \u2192 stop. Right expansion: columns10-19 are0 \u2192 filled with5. So row9 becomes columns4-19:5, except column3=3. But wait, row9's column9 is5. Expanding left and right:\n\nLeft from9: columns8-4. Those are0 \u21925. Right: columns10-19 \u21925. So row9's columns4-8 and10-19 are5, with column9=5. So row9's columns4-19 are5. Columns0-3:0 except column3=3.\n\nNext, (14,8)=8 and (14,14)=8. Horizontal expansion for each.\n\nFor (14,8)=8: expand left and right in row14. After vertical expansion, columns8 and14 are8. Other columns may have numbers from vertical expansions. For example, column3=3, column9=5, column1=2, etc.\n\nSo row14, column8=8. Expand left and right. Left: columns7-0. Columns0-7 are0 (except column3=3). So expanding left from8: columns7-4 are0 \u21928. Column3=3 \u2192 stop. So columns4-8 become8. Right: columns9-13 are0 (except column9=5). So expanding right from8: columns9-13. column9=5 \u2192 stop. So columns8-9:8 and5. So only column8. \n\nThen, (14,14)=8: expand left and right. Left: columns13-0. Columns13-0 are0 except column3=3, column9=5. So expanding left from14: columns13-10 are0 \u21928. Column9=5 \u2192 stop. So columns10-14 become8. Right: columns15-19 \u21920 \u21928. \n\nSo combining both expansions:\n\ncolumns4-8 (from8), columns10-14 (from14), and columns15-19 (from14's right expansion). Column9=5. So row14's columns4-8=8, column9=5, columns10-19=8.\n\nFinally, (18,3)=3's horizontal expansion. After vertical expansion, column3 is3. Row18, column3=3. Expand left and right. In row18, columns0-2 are0, column3=3. Columns4-19 are0 (except any vertical expansions). So expanding left: columns0-2 \u21923. Right: columns4-19 \u21923. So row18 becomes columns0-3=3, columns4-19=3. \n\nNow, putting all this together for the test input's output. Each row would be:\n\nRow0: All 0s except column3=3 (from vertical expansion of row1's3), and column9=5 (from vertical expansion of row2's5).\n\nWait, row0's vertical expansions: column3=3 (from row1's3), column9=5 (from row2's5), column1=2 (from row3's2), column16=2 (from row3's16), columns7 and13=7 (from row7's7), columns8 and14=8 (from row14's8).\n\nBut during vertical expansion:\n\nFor row0:\n\n- column3:3 (from row1's vertical expansion).\n\n- column9:5 (from row2's vertical expansion).\n\n- column1:2 (from row3's vertical expansion).\n\n- column7:7 (from row7's vertical expansion).\n\n- column13:7 (from row7's vertical expansion).\n\n- column8:8 (from row14's vertical expansion).\n\n- column14:8 (from row14's vertical expansion).\n\n- column16:2 (from row3's vertical expansion).\n\nSo row0 has 3,5,2,7,8, etc. in those columns. Then during horizontal expansions, these might have changed.\n\nBut let's process each row based on the vertical and horizontal expansions.\n\nRow0: after vertical expansion, columns1,3,7,8,9,13,14,16 are filled with their respective numbers. The horizontal expansions may have filled other columns.\n\nBut in row0, there are no original cells (except for those in other rows), so horizontal expansion is only from other rows' original cells. Wait, no. Horizontal expansion is done for each original cell in the input, regardless of the row. So row0's cells are filled by vertical expansions from other rows, but no horizontal expansions because there are no original cells in row0.\n\nSo row0's columns are:\n\n0:0\n\n1:2 (from vertical expansion of row3's2).\n\n2:0\n\n3:3 (from row1's vertical expansion).\n\n4-6:0\n\n7:7 (from row7's vertical expansion).\n\n8:8 (from row14's vertical expansion).\n\n9:5 (from row2's vertical expansion).\n\n10-12:0\n\n13:7 (from row7's vertical expansion).\n\n14:8 (from row14's vertical expansion).\n\n15:0\n\n16:2 (from row3's vertical expansion).\n\n17-19:0.\n\nNow, during horizontal expansions from original cells, which are in other rows. So row0's columns are not affected by horizontal expansions from other rows, because horizontal expansions are per row.\n\nSo row0 remains as above.\n\nRow1: after vertical expansion and horizontal expansion from (1,3)=3, which expands to columns2-8 as3.\n\nSo row1's columns:\n\n0:0\n\n1:2 (from row3's vertical expansion).\n\n2:3 (from horizontal expansion).\n\n3:3.\n\n4:3.\n\n5:3.\n\n6:3.\n\n7:3.\n\n8:3.\n\n9:5.\n\n10-19:0.\n\nRow2: after vertical expansion and horizontal expansion from (2,9)=5.\n\nRow2's columns:\n\n0:0\n\n1:2.\n\n2:0.\n\n3:3.\n\n4:5.\n\n5:5.\n\n6:5.\n\n7:5.\n\n8:5.\n\n9:5.\n\n10-19:0.\n\nRow3: after vertical and horizontal expansions as discussed earlier.\n\nColumns0-2:2, column3:3, columns4-16:2, 17-19:0.\n\nRow4-6: all columns have 0s except those filled by vertical expansions.\n\nFor example, row4:\n\ncolumns1:2,3:3,7:7,8:8,9:5,13:7,14:8,16:2.\n\nOther columns:0.\n\nNo horizontal expansions in these rows since no original cells here.\n\nRow7: after vertical and horizontal expansions:\n\ncolumns4-7:7,8:7,9:5,10-13:7,14:8.\n\nRow8: columns7:7,13:7, others filled by vertical expansions.\n\nRow9: after horizontal expansion, columns4-19:5 except column3=3.\n\nRow10-13: similar to row9, columns9 filled with5 from vertical expansion, others based on vertical expansions.\n\nRow14: columns4-8:8,9:5,10-14:8,15-19:8.\n\nRow15-17: columns8 and14 filled with8 from vertical expansion.\n\nRow18: after horizontal expansion, columns0-19 filled with3.\n\nRow19: columns3:3 (from row18's vertical expansion), others based on vertical expansions.\n\nBut this is getting quite complex. The final step is to apply all these steps and create the output grid. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed to write the output based on the described pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a grid of numbers, mostly zeros with some non-zero numbers. The output seems to modify certain rows or columns based on those non-zero numbers. Let me start by examining Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, there's a 2 in the third row, seventh column. The output has a vertical line of 2s starting from that position, extending upwards and downwards. Then there's a 3 in the seventh row, which creates a horizontal line of 3s. Similarly, the 8 in the 13th row creates a vertical line downwards, and the 6 in the 19th row creates a vertical line upwards. The 5 in the 21st row forms a horizontal line.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for each non-zero number, draw a horizontal line (left and right) or vertical line (up and down) based on some condition. Wait, but how do we determine the direction? Let me check the numbers. In Example 0, the 2 is in row 3, column 7. The output creates a vertical line of 2s in column 7 from rows 3 up to 13. Then the 3s are in row 7, columns 4 to 12, making a horizontal line. The 8s in rows 13 and 14 start a vertical line going down. The 6 in row 19 (which is the 19th row, but the input shows row 19 as having a 6 in column 5) creates a vertical line upwards. The 5 in row 21 (input's 21st row) is in column 3 and 8, and in the output, they form a horizontal line between them and also connect with the 6.\n\nHmm, maybe each number represents a direction? Like 2 is vertical, 3 is horizontal, 5 is horizontal, 6 is vertical, 8 is vertical. Wait, but how? For example, in Example 1, the input has a 4 in row 2, column 4. The output creates a vertical line of 4s from row 2 down to row 10. Then the 3s in row 4 create a horizontal line. The 7s in row 8 are horizontal. The 9 in row 12 creates a vertical line down. The 8s in row 14 create a horizontal line connected to the 9's vertical.\n\nSo maybe each non-zero number acts as a \"source\" and propagates its value in a certain direction until it hits another non-zero number. The direction might be determined by the number itself. For example:\n\n- 2: vertical\n- 3: horizontal\n- 4: vertical\n- 5: horizontal\n- 6: vertical\n- 7: horizontal\n- 8: horizontal\n- 9: vertical\n\nWait, but how do we know which direction each number represents? Maybe even numbers are vertical and odd are horizontal? Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, 2 is even and vertical. 3 is odd and horizontal. 5 is odd and horizontal. 6 is even and vertical. 8 is even and vertical. In Example 1, 4 is even and vertical. 3 is odd and horizontal. 7 is odd and horizontal. 9 is odd and vertical? Wait, but in Example 1's output, 9 is vertical. That breaks the pattern. Hmm. Maybe the number's parity isn't the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number determines the direction. For example:\n\n- Numbers 2,4,6,8 (even) are vertical.\n- Numbers 3,5,7,9 (odd) are horizontal.\n\nBut in Example 1, the 9 in row 12, column 6 is vertical. Wait, the output shows that 9 is vertical. But 9 is odd. So that contradicts the previous idea. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at the numbers in the outputs:\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 is vertical. The 3 is horizontal. The 5 is horizontal. The 6 is vertical. The 8 is vertical.\n\nIn Example 1, the 4 is vertical. The 3 is horizontal. The 7 is horizontal. The 9 is vertical. The 8 is horizontal. Wait, in Example 1's output, the 8s in row 14 are part of a horizontal line connected to the 9's vertical line. So maybe the 8 is horizontal here. But earlier, in Example 0, the 8 was vertical. So that's inconsistent. So maybe the direction isn't determined by the number's value. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each number propagates in all directions until it hits another number. But that doesn't fit because in Example 0, the 2 in row 3, column 7 has 2s only in the same column, not rows. Similarly, the 3 in row 7, column 4 and 12 creates a horizontal line. So maybe each number starts a line in a particular direction and stops when another number is encountered.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each non-zero number creates a line in the direction determined by its parity. Even numbers are vertical, odd numbers are horizontal. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0:\n\n- 2 (even) \u2192 vertical line. Yes, in the output, column 7 has 2s vertically.\n- 3 (odd) \u2192 horizontal line. Yes, row 7 has 3s horizontally.\n- 5 (odd) \u2192 horizontal line. In the input, there are two 5s in row 21, columns 3 and 8. In the output, they are connected with 5s in between, forming a horizontal line.\n- 6 (even) \u2192 vertical line. In input row 19, column 5. Output has 6s vertically upwards and downwards? Wait, in the output, row 19 and 20 have 6s in column 5, and row 21 has 5s connected. Maybe the 6 in column 5 creates a vertical line upwards and downwards, but in the output, there are multiple rows with 6s in column 5. Let me check: in the input, the 6 is at row 19 (if we count starting from 0?), but the output shows rows 19-27 (assuming 0-based) with 6 in column 5. Wait, maybe the 6 is vertical downwards. Similarly, the 8 in row 13 is even and vertical. So maybe even numbers create vertical lines, odd horizontal.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\n- 4 (even) \u2192 vertical. Yes, in output, column 4 has 4s from row 2 down to row 10.\n- 3 (odd) \u2192 horizontal. In row 4, columns 3-7 are 3s.\n- 7 (odd) \u2192 horizontal. In row 8, columns 3-5 are 7s.\n- 9 (odd) \u2192 horizontal? But in the output, 9 is vertical. Wait, this contradicts. The 9 in input row 12, column 6 is in the output a vertical line. So if 9 is odd, but vertical, then the parity rule is invalid.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So maybe the direction isn't based on parity. Another idea: maybe the number's last digit modulo 4? Or perhaps the number itself indicates the direction. Like 2 is down, 3 is right, etc. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's see the positions of the numbers and their propagation.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 at (row 2, column 6) [assuming 0-based] propagates down to row 13, same column. The 3s at (6,3) and (6,11) spread horizontally. The 8 at (12,14) propagates down. The 6 at (18,4) propagates up and down? Wait, in the output, rows 18-27 (assuming input has 30 rows?), but in Example 0's input, the 6 is in row 18 (0-based), and the output shows multiple rows below (rows 18 to 27) with 6 in column 5. So maybe the 6 is propagating downward. The 5s in row 20 (input's row 20, columns 2 and 7) spread horizontally to connect.\n\nIn Example 1, the 4 at (2,3) propagates down to row 10. The 3s at (4,2) and (4,7) spread horizontally. The 7s at (8,2) and (8,5) spread horizontally. The 9 at (12,5) propagates down. The 8s at (14,1) and (14,6) spread horizontally.\n\nSo maybe the direction is: if a number is placed, it propagates downward (for even numbers) and horizontally (for odd numbers). But in Example 1, 9 is odd and propagates down. That breaks the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number propagates in all four directions (up, down, left, right) until it hits another non-zero. But in Example 0, the 2 only propagates vertically. So maybe the propagation is only in one direction per number. Maybe the number's value indicates direction. For example:\n\n- 2: vertical down\n- 3: horizontal right\n- 4: vertical up\n- 5: horizontal left\n- etc.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the lines seem to connect the numbers. For example, in Example 0, the 2 in row 2, column 6 connects down to the 8 in row 12. Then the 8 connects down. The 3s connect horizontally. The 6 in row 18 connects upwards to the 5s, which then connect horizontally.\n\nWait, maybe each non-zero number acts as a node, and the output connects them with lines of their own number in between, creating a path. The direction is determined by the positions. For instance, if two instances of the same number are aligned vertically or horizontally, they form a line between them.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, there's a single 2, but the output has a vertical line of 2s extending from it. So perhaps each number creates a line in one direction until it hits another number. The direction could be determined by the number's properties. Maybe even numbers go down, odd go right. Let's test:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- 2 (even) \u2192 down. The line of 2s extends down from row 2 to row 13. Then the 8 is even and in row 13, column 14, which then extends down. So maybe even numbers propagate down.\n- 3 (odd) \u2192 right. The 3s in row 6, columns 3 and 11. The line connects them horizontally, filling in between with 3s.\n- 5 (odd) \u2192 right. The 5s in row 20, columns 2 and 7, connected with 5s in between.\n- 6 (even) \u2192 down. The 6 in row 18, column 4. The output has 6s in column 4 from row 18 down to 27.\n- 8 (even) \u2192 down. The 8 in row 12, column 14. The output has 8s down from there.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\n- 4 (even) \u2192 down. The 4 in row 2, column 3. The output has 4s down to row 10.\n- 3 (odd) \u2192 right. The 3s in row 4, columns 2 and 7. The line connects them with 3s in between.\n- 7 (odd) \u2192 right. The 7s in row 8, columns 2 and 5. Line connects them.\n- 9 (odd) \u2192 right? But in the output, 9 is vertical. Wait, the 9 is in row 12, column 5. The output shows a vertical line of 9s down to row 18. So this contradicts the previous idea. Unless 9 is even, but 9 is odd. So maybe some numbers are exceptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers indicate the length of the line. Like 2 propagates 2 steps in some direction. But that doesn't fit because the lines are longer than the numbers.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's consider another angle. The output seems to fill in between non-zero numbers of the same value if they are in the same row or column. For example, in Example 0, the two 3s in row 6, columns 3 and 11 are connected with 3s in between. Similarly, the two 5s in row 20 are connected. The 2 and 8 in column 7 and 14 respectively are part of a vertical line. Wait, but in the input, there's a 2 and an 8 in the same column? Not exactly. The 2 is in column 7, and the 8 is in column 14, which is different. So that doesn't explain.\n\nWait, maybe each non-zero number acts as a \"source\" that propagates its number in all four directions until it hits another non-zero number. But in Example 0's 2, it's propagating only vertically. So maybe the direction is determined by the number's value. For example:\n\n- 2: vertical\n- 3: horizontal\n- 4: vertical\n- 5: horizontal\n- 6: vertical\n- 7: horizontal\n- 8: vertical\n- 9: vertical (since in Example 1, 9 is vertical)\n\nBut how does that work with 9 being vertical? Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's input, there's a 9 in row 12, column 5. The output shows a vertical line of 9s from row 12 down to row 18. So 9 is vertical. So maybe numbers 2,4,6,8,9 are vertical, and 3,5,7 are horizontal. That could be possible.\n\nIf that's the case, then for the test input:\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nNon-zero numbers are:\n\nRow 1, column 3: 3 (horizontal)\nRow 2, column 9:5 (horizontal)\nRow 3, column 1:2 (vertical)\nRow 3, column 16:2 (vertical)\nRow 7, column 7:7 (horizontal)\nRow 7, column 13:7 (horizontal)\nRow 9, column 9:5 (horizontal)\nRow 14, column 8:8 (vertical)\nRow 14, column 14:8 (vertical)\nRow 18, column 3:3 (horizontal)\n\nSo according to the pattern:\n\n- 3 (row1, col3) \u2192 horizontal line. So fill between any 3s in the same row. But in the input, there's only one 3 in row1. But in the output example 0, a single 3 would create a horizontal line? Wait in example 0, the 3s were two in the same row connected. So maybe if there's a single 3, it doesn't spread. But the test input has 3 in row1 and row18. So maybe each 3 in a row will spread horizontally until another number.\n\nWait, perhaps the direction is horizontal for odd numbers (3,5,7,9?) and vertical for even (2,4,6,8). But 9 is odd and vertical in example 1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that numbers spread in their direction (horizontal or vertical) based on their parity, but some exceptions like 9.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is determined by the number's position: if a number is alone in its row, it spreads vertically; if alone in its column, horizontally? Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to apply the pattern to the test input.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nRow 1, column 3 has a 3. Since 3 is odd, maybe it spreads horizontally. But there's another 3 in row18, column3. Are they in the same column? No, different rows. So each 3 would spread horizontally in their respective rows.\n\nRow3 has two 2s (even numbers) at columns1 and 16. So each 2 would spread vertically. So column1 and column16 would have 2s spreading down from row3.\n\nRow7 has two 7s (odd) in columns7 and13. So they spread horizontally, filling between them with 7s.\n\nRow9 has a 5 (odd) at column9. Since there's another 5 in row2, column9. Are they in the same column? Yes. So maybe the 5s in column9 (rows2 and9) would form a vertical line? But 5 is odd, which would suggest horizontal. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, for the 5s in column9 (rows2 and9), since they are in the same column, and 5 is odd, perhaps they spread horizontally in their own rows. So row2's 5 would spread left/right in row2, and row9's 5 would spread left/right in row9.\n\nRow14 has two 8s (even) in columns8 and14. Since even numbers spread vertically, so each 8 would spread down from their positions.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nRow1, column3 (3): spread horizontally left and right until another number. Since row1 has only 3 in column3, the entire row1 would be filled with 3s from column3 outward until the ends or another number. But in the input row1, there's only 3 in column3, so output row1 would be 3s from column3 onwards? Wait, in example0, the single 3s in row6 (columns3 and11) were connected, but when there's only one, maybe it's not. Wait, in example0's input, there were two 3s in the same row, and the output filled between them. So for a single 3, maybe it spreads in both directions until the ends.\n\nBut the test input's row1 has a single 3 in column3. So perhaps the output for row1 would have 3s from column3 to the end of the row. But looking at example1's input, the 4 in column3 of row2 was a single number, and the output filled the entire column3 from row2 down to row10. So maybe the direction is vertical for even numbers, horizontal for odd.\n\nThus, for the test input:\n\n- Each 3 (odd) spreads horizontally in their row.\n- Each 2 (even) spreads vertically in their column.\n- Each 7 (odd) spreads horizontally in their row between columns7 and13.\n- Each 5 (odd) spreads horizontally in their respective rows (rows2 and9).\n- Each 8 (even) spreads vertically in their columns (columns8 and14).\n\nSo let's try to construct the output:\n\nRow1 (input has 3 at column3): spread horizontally. So row1 becomes all 3s from column3 left and right until the ends, but since there are no other numbers, the entire row1 from column3 onward. Wait, but in example0, the 3s in row7 (input) at columns3 and11 created a horizontal line between them. So for a single 3, maybe it spreads to the entire row. But example1's input had a 4 in column3 of row2, which spread down the column. So maybe for a single even number, it spreads vertically, and a single odd spreads horizontally.\n\nThus, row1's 3 would spread horizontally all the way, making row1 from column3 to end as 3s. But the input's row1 starts as 0s except column3. So output row1 would be:\n\n[0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nBut wait, the test input's row1 is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo the output would replace all zeros in the same row after the 3 with 3s. But in example1's input, the 4 in column3 spread down the column, not the row. So perhaps even numbers spread vertically, odd horizontally.\n\nSo the 3 in row1, column3 (odd) spreads horizontally. So row1 becomes 3s from column3 to the end. But the first three columns remain 0.\n\nWait, but in example0's 3s in row6, columns3 and11 were connected, filling between. So if there's a single 3, would it spread to the entire row? Or only to the left and right until another number. Since in example1's input, the 3 in row4, column2 and7 were connected with 3s in between, but the 7s in row8, columns2 and5 were connected with 7s. So if there's a single instance, perhaps it spreads in both directions to the ends of the row.\n\nThus, row1 would have 3s from column3 to the end (columns3-19). So row1's output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nSimilarly, row18 has a 3 in column3. So row18 would spread 3s horizontally from column3 to the end.\n\nNow, the 2s in row3, columns1 and16 (even) spread vertically. So each column1 and16 would have 2s from row3 down to the next non-zero number. But in the input, below row3, columns1 and16 are zeros. So the 2s would spread down until they hit another number. Let's check if there's any numbers in those columns. For column1, the only number is the 2 in row3. So it would spread down to the bottom. Column16 has the 2 in row3 and possibly others. Let's check the input:\n\nLooking at the test input, the 2s are in row3, columns1 and16. Are there any other numbers in columns1 or16? For column1, the rest are zeros. So the 2 in column1 would spread down all rows from row3 to the bottom (rows3 to 19). Similarly, column16's 2 would spread down from row3 to the end.\n\nThe 7s in row7, columns7 and13 (odd) would spread horizontally between them. So row7 would have 7s from column7 to 13.\n\nThe 5s in row2, column9 and row9, column9 (odd) would each spread horizontally. So row2's 5 would spread left and right in row2. But row2's input is:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 5 is in column9. Spreading horizontally would fill the entire row2 with 5s from column9 to the ends. But wait, in example0's 5s were in row20, columns2 and7, and the output connected them with 5s. So if there's a single 5, it would spread the entire row. So row2 would have 5s from column9 to the end (columns9-19) and possibly to the start (0-9). But in example1, the 3 in row4 had two instances and filled between. So maybe for a single occurrence, it spreads to both directions until the ends.\n\nBut in example1's 4, which is even, a single 4 in column3 spread down the column. So for a single odd number in a row, it spreads horizontally to the entire row. For even, vertically to the entire column.\n\nThus, row2's 5 (odd) would spread left and right, filling the entire row2 with 5s. But the input row2 has 5 in column9. So output row2 would be all 5s from column0 to 19? Wait, but example0's single 2 was in column7 and spread vertically. So for a single even number, spread vertically. For single odd, spread horizontally.\n\nSo row2's 5 would make the entire row2 filled with 5s. Similarly, row9's 5 would fill the entire row9 with 5s.\n\nThe 8s in row14, columns8 and14 (even) would each spread vertically down. So column8 would have 8s from row14 down, and column14 from row14 down. Are there any numbers below row14 in those columns? The input doesn't show any, so they would spread to the bottom.\n\nPutting this all together, let's outline the test output step by step:\n\nRow1: all 3s from column3 to the end. [0,0,0,3,3,...,3]\n\nRow2: all 5s. [5,5,...,5]\n\nRow3: 2s in columns1 and16. The rest are 0 except for the original 2s, but since they spread vertically, the row3 would have 2s in columns1 and16, and the rest 0. Wait, no. Wait, the vertical spread is for the columns. So row3's 2s are in columns1 and16, and those columns will have 2s from row3 down. The row itself remains as input except for any horizontal spreads. But since the 2s are even, their spread is vertical, not affecting the row's other columns.\n\nWait, perhaps the vertical spread only affects the same column. So for each even number in a cell, the entire column below (and maybe above?) is filled with that number until another number is encountered.\n\nIn example0, the 2 in row3, column7 (input's third row, which is index 2) spread down to row13. So perhaps the vertical spread is downwards until another number is found. For example, in the test input, the 2 in row3, column1 would spread down from row3 to the end (rows3 to19) in column1. Similarly, column16's 2 spreads down from row3 to the end.\n\nSimilarly, the 8s in row14, columns8 and14 would spread down from row14 to the end.\n\nThe 7s in row7, columns7 and13 (odd) would spread horizontally between them. So row7 would have 7s from column7 to 13.\n\nThe 3s in row1 and row18 (columns3 and3) spread horizontally in their respective rows.\n\nThe 5s in row2 and row9 spread horizontally in their rows, filling them with 5s.\n\nSo constructing the output:\n\nRow0: all 0s.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow2: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0] (original input for row3, plus vertical spreads which don't affect this row's other columns)\n\nBut wait, the vertical spreads are in the columns, so other rows in columns1 and16 will have 2s. For example, row4, column1 would be 2, row5 column1 would be 2, etc.\n\nSimilarly, columns8 and14 from row14 down would have 8s.\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRows14-19 in columns8 and14: filled with 8s.\n\nAlso, row18's 3 in column3 spreads horizontally, filling row18 with 3s from column3 to end.\n\nSo compiling all these changes, the output should have:\n\n- Column1 filled with 2s from row3 down.\n- Column16 filled with 2s from row3 down.\n- Columns7-13 in row7 filled with 7s.\n- Rows1 and18 filled with 3s starting from column3.\n- Rows2 and9 filled with 5s.\n- Columns8 and14 filled with 8s from row14 down.\n\nPutting it all together, the final output would look like:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,2,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but row18's 3 in column3 would spread horizontally. So row18 would be:\n\n[0,2,0,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,2,0,0,0]\n\nBut I think I made a mistake here. The row18 in the test input is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAfter applying the spread, since it's a 3 (odd), it spreads horizontally. So the entire row18 would be 3s from column3 to the end. But columns8 and14 have 8s from the vertical spread. So the 3s would overwrite the 8s in row18, but since the 8s are even and spread down from row14, the 8s are in columns8 and14 for rows14-19. So row18's columns8 and14 are 8s, but the 3s from row18's spread would overlap. But according to the examples, when two numbers overlap, which one takes precedence?\n\nLooking at example0's row7, which had 3s and 2s. The 2 was in column7, and the 3s were in columns3-12. So in row7, column7, the 2 is present. But in the output, row7, column7 is 2. So the vertical line (2) takes precedence over the horizontal line (3). So when a cell is part of multiple spreads, the original number is kept, and the spread numbers are added where there were zeros. But wait, in example0's row7, column7 had a 2 in the input, and the output has 2 there, even though the 3s are spreading horizontally. So the original numbers are preserved, and the spread fills in the zeros.\n\nThus, in the test input's row18, the 3 in column3 spreads horizontally, filling columns3-19 with 3s, except where there are existing numbers. The columns8 and14 have 8s from the vertical spread (even numbers). But in row18, the original input has 3 in column3 and 0s elsewhere. The vertical spread from row14's 8s would fill columns8 and14 with 8s in rows14-19. So row18's columns8 and14 are 8s, and the rest of the row from column3 are 3s.\n\nSo row18's output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nBut wait, the original input for row18 is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo the 3 is in column3. The spread would be horizontal (left and right). But since the input has 3 only in column3, the horizontal spread would fill from column3 to the end (right) and maybe left. Wait, example0's 3s in row6 were in columns3 and11, and the spread was between them. So for a single 3, does it spread left and right to fill the entire row? In example1's row4, the 3s in columns2 and7 filled between. So perhaps if there's only one instance, it spreads to the entire row. But in example1's row2, the 4 was a single instance and spread down the column.\n\nSo for row18's 3 (single, odd), the entire row would be 3s, except where there are existing non-zero numbers (like the 8s in columns8 and14 from the vertical spread). So row18 would be:\n\n[0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nSimilarly, row14's columns8 and14 have 8s, and they spread down. So rows14-19 in columns8 and14 are 8s.\n\nPutting this all together, the final output for the test input would be:\n\nEach row:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow2: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0] (original input)\n\nRows4-13 for column1 and16: filled with 2s.\n\nRow7: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRows14-19, columns8 and14: filled with 8s.\n\nRow18: [0,2,0,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,2,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but in row3, columns1 and16 have 2s, and those columns are filled with 2s below. So rows4-19, column1 and16 are all 2s.\n\nSo row4 would be:\n\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nSame for rows5-13 and 14-19, except where other numbers are present.\n\nFor example, row7 would have:\n\ncolumns1: 2, column7-13:7, column16:2.\n\nSo row7:\n\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nSimilarly, row14 would have:\n\ncolumns1:2, column8:8, column14:8, column16:2.\n\nRow14:\n\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nBut since the 8s in columns8 and14 are even, they spread down. So rows14-19 in columns8 and14 are 8s.\n\nRow14:\n\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow15:\n\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,0,0]\n\n... and so on to row19.\n\nRow18:\n\n[0,2,0,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow19:\n\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nBut row19 in the input is all zeros except column3 in row18. So after applying the spreads, row19 has 2s in columns1 and16, and 8s in columns8 and14.\n\nPutting all this together, the final output would have:\n\n- Rows1 filled with 3s from column3 onwards.\n- Rows2 and9 filled with 5s.\n- Columns1 and16 filled with 2s from row3 down.\n- Row7 filled with 7s between columns7-13.\n- Columns8 and14 filled with 8s from row14 down.\n- Row18 filled with 3s from column3 onwards, except columns8 and14 which are 8s.\n\nThis seems to match the pattern observed in the training examples.",
