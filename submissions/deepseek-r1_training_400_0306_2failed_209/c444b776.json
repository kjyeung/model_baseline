        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, especially Example 0. The input and output are both grids of numbers. Let's compare the input rows to the output rows.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has a row of all 4s in the middle (the 10th row), and the output keeps that row the same. Then, looking at the rows above and below that middle row, there's some kind of reflection happening. For instance, in the input, the 12th row (0-based index 11) has a 7 at position 5. In the output, the same row has a 7 at position 5 and also at position 15, which is symmetric around the middle (position 9, since the length is 19). Wait, 19 elements, so the middle is index 9. So positions 5 and 13 would be symmetric around 9. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input row 11 (0-based) in Example 0:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput row 11 becomes:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\nAh, here the 7 is at position 5 and 15. Since the middle is at 9, 5 is 4 positions left, so the mirror is 9 + (9-5) = 13? Wait, 9 is the center. For a 19-element list, the middle index is 9 (since indexes start at 0). The distance from 5 to 9 is 4, so the mirror position would be 9 + (9-5) = 13? But in the output, the 7 is at position 15. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's see: 9 is the center. For position i, the mirrored position is 18 - i. Because the total length is 19, so the last index is 18. So if you have a position i, the mirror is 18 - i. Let's check for the 7 in position 5. 18 - 5 = 13. But in the output, the 7 is at position 15. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe the reflection is around the center column, which is index 9. So for any element in position j, its mirror is 18 - j. Let's test that. For position 5: 18 -5 =13. So if input has a 7 at 5, output should have it at 5 and 13? But in the output, the 7 is at 5 and 15. Wait, that's 5 and 15. 18-5=13, not 15. That doesn't fit. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the reflection axis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reflection is vertical, splitting the grid into left and right halves. So each row is mirrored around the center column. But in Example 0's input row 11, the 7 is in the left half, and in the output, it's mirrored to the right half. Let's check the positions again. Original position of 7 is 5. The center is 9, so 9 -5 =4. The mirror position would be 9 +4 +1=14? Or maybe 9 + (9 -5) =13. Wait, if the center is index 9, then the distance from 5 to 9 is 4. So the mirror would be 9 +4 =13. But in the output, the 7 is at 15. That's 6 positions from the end. Wait, maybe the reflection is not around the exact center but some other axis. Alternatively, maybe the entire grid is duplicated on the other side of the center row. Wait, looking at the first example's output, the middle row (all 4s) remains the same, and the rows above and below it are mirrored. For instance, the rows above the middle are copied below the middle in reverse order, or each row is mirrored around the center. But looking at the first example, the output has the same number of rows as the input. So maybe each row is mirrored around its own center. So for each row, elements are mirrored left-right around the center column.\n\nIn Example 0, the input row 11 has a 7 at index 5. The output row 11 has 7 at index 5 and 15. Wait, the original row is [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]. Wait, the 7 is at position 5 and 15. But in the original, position 15 is 0. So it's like the left side is mirrored to the right. Wait, the left half (before the center) is copied to the right half. So for example, the first 9 elements (indices 0-8) would be mirrored on the right side (indices 10-18). The center (index 9) stays as 4. So if the left side has a 7 at index 5, then the mirrored position would be 18 -5 =13? Or maybe it's mirrored across the center column. Let's see: in a 19-element row, the center is at index 9. So each element at position i (from 0 to 8) is mirrored at position 18 -i. So for i=5, the mirror is 18-5=13. So in the output, the 7 is at 5 and 13? But in the example given, the output row 11 is [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]. Wait, position 15 is 15, which is 15-9=6 to the right of center. The original position was 5, which is 4 to the left of center. So maybe the mirroring is not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the entire left half (up to index 9) is mirrored, but including the center. Wait, the original row has 19 elements, indices 0-18. The center is 9. So the left half is 0-8, and the right half is 10-18. So mirroring would take elements from the left and place them symmetrically on the right. So if the left half has a 7 at index 5, the right mirror would be index 13 (since 9 + (9-5) =13). Wait, 9 is the center. So for a position i in 0-8, the mirrored position is 18 -i. Let's check:\n\nOriginal position 5 (value 7) in the input row. The mirrored position would be 18-5=13. But in the output, the 7 is at position 15. Hmm, that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the reflection is not around the center but around the middle row of the entire grid. Wait, in Example 0, the input has 19 rows. The middle row is row 9 (0-based). The output seems to have the same structure. But in the output, the rows after the middle row (row 9) are copies of the rows before but mirrored. For example, row 10 in the output is the same as row 8 in the input. Wait, looking at the input and output:\n\nInput rows 0-8: all have a 4 at index 9. Output rows 0-8 are same as input. Then the output rows 10-18 are the mirrored versions of rows 8-0. Wait, looking at Example 0's output, row 10 is same as input row 8, which is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Then row 11 in output is same as input row 7 but mirrored. Wait, no. Let me check input row 7: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Output row 11 is [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]. But input row 7 has no 7. Wait, perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe each row is mirrored around its own center. So for each row, the elements left of the center are mirrored to the right. For example, in the input row 11 (index 11) of Example 0, which is [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The center is index 9 (value 4). The elements to the left of the center (indices 0-8) are [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]. If we mirror this part, the right side (indices 10-18) would become [0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0], but in the output row 11, the right side has a 7 at index 15. Hmm, maybe it's a different kind of mirroring.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be that each row is split into two halves around the center, and the left half is mirrored on the right. So for a row of length 19, the left half is 0-8, the center is 9, then the right half is 10-18. The output would take the left half and mirror it (reverse) and place it on the right. Wait, let's see. For the input row 11 in Example 0, the left half (0-8) is [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]. If mirrored (reversed), it would be [0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0]. So the right half (indices 10-18) would be this reversed left half. So the output row would be [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0]. But the actual output has a 7 at position 5 (original) and 15. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, in the output, the 7 is at position 5 and 15. Position 15 is 15-9=6 to the right. So maybe the mirroring is such that each element in the left half (positions 0-8) is mirrored to the right half (positions 10-18) such that position i in the left maps to position 18 - i. For example, position 5 in the left would map to 18 -5 =13. But in the output, the 7 is at position 15. So this doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe the mirroring is across the entire row, so that the entire row is mirrored. But that would mean the row is reversed. But in Example 0's output row 11, it's not reversed. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire grid is mirrored vertically. So the rows after the middle row are mirrored versions of the rows before. For example, row 10 in the output is row 8 from the input. Row 11 in output is row 7 from input, but mirrored. Let me check. Input row 7 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Output row 11 is [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]. That doesn't match. So maybe not that either.\n\nLooking at Example 1: input is a 19x9 grid (wait, the input has 19 rows, each of 9 elements). The output is the same as the input, but after the middle row (row 9, which is all 4s), the same rows from the top are repeated. For example, the rows 0-8 are copied again as rows 10-18. Wait, in Example 1's output, after row 9 (the all 4s), rows 10-18 are the same as rows 0-8. So input rows 0-8 are [0,0,0...], and output rows 10-18 are the same. So the pattern here is that the output duplicates the upper half below the middle row. But wait, in Example 0, the output's lower half (after the middle) isn't a direct copy. Let's compare.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 19 rows. The middle row (row 9) is all 4s. The output also has 19 rows. The rows after the middle (rows 10-18) are not the same as the rows before. For example, row 10 in the output is [0,0,...4,0...], same as input row 8. But row 11 in output is input row 7 with mirrored elements. Wait, input row 7 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], output row 11 is [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]. So perhaps the lower half rows are mirrored versions of the upper half rows. For example, output row 10 is input row 8, row 11 is input row 7 mirrored, row 12 is input row 6 mirrored, etc. But how is the mirroring done?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lower half is a mirror of the upper half, but each row is mirrored left-right. For example, in Example 0, row 11 in output corresponds to row 7 in input, but mirrored. Let's check:\n\nInput row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. If mirrored left-right, this would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], same as original. But in the output row 11, there's a 7 added. Wait, that doesn't fit. So maybe not simple row mirroring.\n\nLooking back at Example 0, the input's row 12 (index 12) is [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output row 12 is [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 2 is at index 3 and 13. Which are symmetric around the center. So index 3 and 18-3=15? Wait 18-3=15, but the 2 is at 13. Hmm. Wait, maybe the transformation is that the left half (excluding center) is copied to the right half in reverse order. So for each element in the left half (indices 0-8), place it in the right half's corresponding mirrored position. So for index i in 0-8, the mirrored position in the right half is 18 -i. For example, in row 12, the 2 is at index 3. The mirrored position would be 18-3=15. But in the output, it's at index 13. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are duplicated on both sides of the center. For example, any number in the left half is mirrored in the right half. So if there's a number in the left half (before the center), it's also placed symmetrically in the right half. So for each element at position i (0 \u2264 i < center), the mirrored position is (center * 2 - i). For a 19-element row, center is 9. So mirrored position is 18 - i. For example, if i=5, mirrored is 13. But in Example 0's output row 11, the 7 is at 5 and 15. Wait, 15 is 6 positions from the end. Maybe the mirroring is done around the center column. Wait, perhaps the center is considered the axis, and each element is mirrored across it. So for position i, the mirrored is (center * 2 - i). Let's compute that. For i=5, mirrored position would be 9*2 -5 =18-5=13. So if input has a 7 at 5, output has it at 5 and 13. But in Example 0's output row 11, the 7 is at 5 and 15. That doesn't fit. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is created by taking the input and, for each row, copying the non-zero elements from the left half of the row (before the center) to their mirrored positions on the right half. For example, any non-zero number in the left half is duplicated on the right half's mirrored position. Let's test this with Example 0.\n\nInput row 11 (index 11) has a 7 at position 5 (left half). The output row 11 has 7 at 5 and 15. Wait, 15 is 15-9=6 to the right of the center. So mirrored position would be 9 + (5 - (9 - position)), maybe? Alternatively, perhaps the mirrored position is (length -1) - i. For length 19, positions 0-18. So for i=5, mirrored is 18-5=13. But in the output, it's at 15. That's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers in the left half (positions 0-8) are copied to the right half (positions 10-18) in reverse order, but not overlapping with the center. So the left half is copied reversed to the right half. For example, left half is 0-8, then reversed would be 8-0, placed in 10-18. So element at 5 in left would be placed at 10 + (8-5) =13. So 5 \u219213. But in output row 11, the 7 is at 5 and 15. Hmm, not matching.\n\nLet's take another example. Example 0's input row 13 (index 13) is [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Output row 13 is [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 2 is at index 2 and 12. Index 2 is in the left half, and 12 is in the right half. 18-2=16, but 12 is not 16. Wait, 2 in the left half (index 2) is mirrored to index 12. How? 9 is the center. So 9 -2=7. The mirrored position would be 9 +7=16. So 2 would be at 16. But in output, it's at 12. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero element in the left half is duplicated in the right half at a position that is a certain offset from the center. For example, if there's a number at position i in the left, it's mirrored at position (center + (i - center))? Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: In Example 0's output, the middle row (all 4s) is unchanged. The rows above and below the middle row seem to have mirrored elements. For example, row 8 in the input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and row 10 in the output is the same. Row 7 in input is similar, but row 11 in output has mirrored elements. Maybe the lower half of the output is the upper half mirrored both vertically (row order) and horizontally (each row's elements). For example, rows below the middle are the rows above in reverse order, and each of those rows is mirrored left-right.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, row 11 (which is the second row below the middle) has elements that seem to correspond to row 7 (which is two rows above the middle). For example, input row 7 has no 7s, but output row 11 has two 7s. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output after the middle row (all 4s) is a copy of the rows before the middle. So the output is the input, then the input rows again, starting from row 0. But this isn't the case in Example 0. So the pattern may vary between examples. Wait, but that can't be. There must be a common pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the middle row is a line of 4s. Then, the rows below the middle are copies of the rows above, but each row is mirrored around the center column, with non-zero elements from the left copied to the right. So any non-zero element in the left half of a row in the upper part is mirrored in the right half of the corresponding row in the lower part.\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 11 (index 11, which is the second row below the middle) corresponds to row 7 (index 7, two rows above the middle). Input row 7 has a 4 in the center and 0s elsewhere. Output row 11 has 7s at positions 5 and 15. Wait, but input row 7 has no 7s. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take each non-zero element in the left half of a row and mirror it to the right half. For example, if there's a number in the left half (positions 0-8), then the same number is placed symmetrically in the right half (positions 10-18), with the center (position 9) remaining as 4.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's input row 11 (index 11):\n\nInput row 11: [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLeft half (positions 0-8): [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]\n\nThe right half (positions 10-18) should mirror this. So the mirror of the left half would be the same elements reversed. But reversed left half is [0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0]. So the right half would be this, making the output row:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output row 11 is [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]. So the 7s are at positions 5 and 15. Hmm, that doesn't fit the reversed left half. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: For each row, the right half (after the center) is a mirror of the left half (before the center), but the mirroring is such that each element at position i in the left is placed at position (18 - i) in the right. So for example, if there's a 7 at position 5 in the left, it would be placed at position 13 (18 -5) in the right. But in the output row 11, the 7 is at position 15, which is 18-3=15. Wait, 18-3=15. So if there was a 7 at position 3 in the left, it would be at 15. But in the input row 11, the 7 is at position 5, so why is it mirrored to 15? That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirroring is done around the entire grid's middle row. For example, the rows below the middle are mirrors of the rows above. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input and, for each row, adding a mirrored version of the row after the center. So the output has twice the number of rows. Wait, but in Example 0, input and output have the same number of rows. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the middle row is all 4s, and the rows after it are copies of the rows before it, but with their non-zero elements mirrored to the right side. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the rows before the middle (0-8) have non-zero elements only in the center (position 9) except for some rows. For example, row 12 (index 12) in the input has a 2 at position 3. In the output, row 12 has a 2 at position 3 and 13. So the left half's 2 is mirrored to the right half. So position 3 \u2192 position 15 (18-3=15). But the output has it at 13. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each row after the middle is a mirrored version of the corresponding row before the middle. For example, row 10 in output is row 8 (input row 8) mirrored. Row 11 is row 7 mirrored. Row 12 is row 6 mirrored. Etc. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, input row 8 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Output row 10 is the same. So no mirroring here. Row 11 in output is input row 7 mirrored. Input row 7 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. If mirrored, it would remain the same. But the output row 11 has 7s added. So this can't be.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the difference between input and output. In Example 0's output, the middle row is the same. Then, for each row in the input above the middle, the output has that row and also a mirrored version below the middle. But since the output has the same number of rows as the input, that would mean that the lower half is a mirror of the upper half. For example, row 9 is the middle. Rows 0-8 are upper, rows 10-18 are lower. Lower rows are mirrored upper rows. So row 10 in output is row 8 from input. Row 11 is row 7 from input. But in the input, row 7 has no 7s. So that doesn't explain the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking each row from the input and mirroring its left half to the right. So for each row, the left half (before center) is mirrored on the right. So the output has the same rows but with the right half filled with mirrored left half.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 11 (index 11), left half is [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]. Mirroring this would mean the right half is [0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0]. So the entire row would be [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0]. But the output row 11 is [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]. So the 7s are at positions 5 and 15. Which is different from the mirrored left half. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the right half is the reverse of the left half. So for the left half [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0], the reversed left half is [0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0], which would be placed in the right half. So the row becomes [left half][4][reversed left half]. Which would give the 7 at position 5 and 13. But the output has 7 at 15. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: Let's consider that the 4s are a central axis, and all non-zero elements are mirrored across this axis. So any non-zero element to the left of the 4 must have a corresponding element to the right of the 4 at the mirrored position, and vice versa. But in the input rows, some have elements only on the left. The output adds their mirrors on the right.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's input row 11 (index 11), there's a 7 at position 5 (left of center). The output adds a 7 at position 15 (right of center). The distance from 5 to the center (9) is 4. So mirrored position is 9 +4 +1=14? Or 9 + (9-5) =13? But 15 is 6 positions from the center. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the mirrored position is calculated as (center index * 2) - original index. For example, center is 9. So mirrored position is 9*2 - i = 18 -i. For i=5, mirrored position is 13. But the output has 7 at 15, which is 18-3=15. So this suggests that the original index is 3, but in the input row 11, the 7 is at 5. So this doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirrored position is the same distance from the center but on the opposite side. So if the original position is i, then mirrored position is (center index) + (center index -i). For example, center is 9. If i=5, then mirrored position is 9 + (9-5) =13. So 5\u219213. But in the output row 11, the 7 is at 5 and 15. 15-9=6. So the original position is 3 (9-6=3), but the input has a 7 at 5, not 3. This doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. Let's look for a pattern in the positions where numbers are added.\n\nExample 0's input row 11: 7 at 5. Output row 11: 7 at 5 and 15.\n\nExample 0's input row 12: 2 at 3. Output row 12: 2 at 3 and 13.\n\nInput row 13: 2 at 2. Output: 2 at 2 and 12.\n\nInput row 14: 3 at 1 and 5. Output: 3 at 1,5 and 13,17 (since output row 14 has [0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]. Wait, positions 1,5, 11, 15. Wait, no, the output row 14 is [0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]. So the 3s are at positions 1,5,11,15. How does this relate to the input row's 3s at 1 and 5?\n\nInput row 14: [0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So 3s at 1 and 5. Output row 14 has 3s at 1,5,11,15. Which are mirrored around the center. 11 is 9+2=11 (distance 2 from center). 15 is 9+6=15. So the original 3s are at positions 1 and 5 (distance 8 and 4 from the end). Hmm, perhaps the output duplicates the elements from the left to the right, but mirrored across the center. So each non-zero in the left is mirrored to the right. For example, 3 at position 1 (distance 8 from center) would be mirrored to position 17 (9+8=17?), but output has 3 at 11 and 15. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each non-zero element in the left half of any row, the same element is added to the right half of the same row, mirrored across the center. So in Example 0's input row 11, 7 is at position 5. The mirrored position is 13 (9 + (5-0) =14? Not sure. But output has it at 15.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the right half is a copy of the left half, but shifted. For example, the left half is [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0], and the right half (positions 10-18) become [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]. So the 7 is at 5 and 14 (5+9=14). But in output, it's at 5 and 15. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting really stuck. Let's think of another angle. The test input has a row with 29 elements. The middle element is position 14 (since indexes are 0-28). The rows have 4s at positions 9, 19 (assuming each row is 29 elements). Wait, the test input's first row is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo length is 29. So the middle is at index 14 (since 29 is odd). But there are two 4s at positions 9 and 19. So perhaps the middle is between these two 4s. Or maybe the grid is split into two halves around the two 4s. Or maybe each row has two 4s acting as centers.\n\nIn Example 0, the middle row has a single 4 in the center. But in the test input, each row has two 4s. For example, in the first row of the test input, the 4s are at positions 9 and 19. So the row is split into three parts: left of first 4, the two 4s, and the right part. So perhaps the pattern is that each segment between the 4s is mirrored. For example, the left part (before the first 4) is mirrored to the right part (after the second 4), and the middle part (between the two 4s) is treated as a new center.\n\nIn the test input's first row, between the two 4s (positions 9 and 19) are 9 zeros. So maybe the pattern is that for each row, the elements between the two 4s form a new central column, and the left part (before the first 4) is mirrored to the right part (after the second 4). So in the test input's first row, the left part (0-9) is [0,..0,4], and the right part (20-28) should mirror this. But the existing right part after the second 4 (position 19) is all zeros. So the output would mirror the left part (before first 4) to the right part (after second 4). \n\nLet's test this hypothesis. For the first test input row:\n\nLeft part before first 4: positions 0-8 (all zeros).\nMirrored to the right part (after position 19): positions 20-28. So they would also be zeros. So the output row would be the same as input.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the middle row (all 4s) is kept the same. In Example 1, the output after the middle row is a copy of the upper rows. But in the test input, each row has two 4s. So maybe the pattern is that between the two 4s is a new center, and each segment outside is mirrored.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is split into segments separated by 4s, and each segment is mirrored around their own centers. For example, in the test input's first row, there are two 4s. The segments are before the first 4, between the two 4s, and after the second 4. The middle segment (between 4s) has 9 zeros. Maybe each of these segments is mirrored. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the pattern from the training examples is that the output is the input with each row mirrored around its center, and any non-zero elements in the left half are duplicated in the right half. \n\nIn Example 0's input row 11, the 7 is in the left half, so mirrored to the right half. So the output has 7 in both positions. Similarly, the test input's rows have elements in the left half that need to be mirrored to the right.\n\nFor example, in the test input's third row:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe elements before the first 4 are all zeros. Between the two 4s, there's 0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,0. Then after the second 4, zeros. So the mirrored version would be to take the elements between the two 4s, mirror them, and place them after the second 4. So the segment between 4s is length 9. The center of this segment is position 14 (between 9 and 19). The elements are [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,0]. Mirroring this segment would give [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]. So the output row would have between the 4s the original segment, and after the second 4, the mirrored segment. But the length of the row is 29, so after the second 4 (position 19), there are 9 positions (20-28). Mirroring the segment between 4s (positions 10-18) would be to reverse that segment and place it after position 19. So the output for this row would have:\n\nBefore first 4: zeros.\n\nFirst 4 at 9.\n\nBetween 4s: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,0].\n\nSecond 4 at 19.\n\nAfter second 4: reversed segment [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0].\n\nSo the entire row would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,4,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nBut wait, the reversed segment of [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,0] is [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]. So yes, that's correct.\n\nApplying this to the test input's third row, the output should have the segment after the second 4 as the reversed version of the segment between the two 4s.\n\nLooking at other rows in the test input:\n\nTest input's second row:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBetween the two 4s: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0]. Reversed would be [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0], same as original. So the output would be the same as input.\n\nTest input's seventh row:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBetween the two 4s: [0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Reversed would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0]. So after the second 4, the segment becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0]. So the output row would have a 6 at position 25 (19 +6=25).\n\nPutting this all together, the pattern seems to be that for each row, the segment between the two 4s is reversed and appended after the second 4. \n\nIn Example 0, each row has a single 4 in the center. So the entire row is split into left and right around the center 4. The left half is reversed and appended to the right of the 4. So for a row with a single 4, the pattern is to mirror the left half to the right. For example, in Example 0's input row 11, the left half is [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0], reversed would be [0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0], placed to the right of the 4, resulting in the output row [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0]. But in the actual output, the 7 is at position 15, which suggests that maybe the entire left half (including the 4) is reversed and placed to the right. But I'm getting confused.\n\nAnother approach: in the training examples, whenever there's a single 4 in the center of a row, the output row is the input row with the left half mirrored to the right. When there are two 4s, the segment between them is reversed and placed after the second 4. \n\nIn the test input, each row has two 4s. So the pattern would be to reverse the segment between the two 4s and append it after the second 4. For example, the test input's third row has between the 4s the segment [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,0], which reversed is [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0], placed after the second 4. So the output for that row would have:\n\nBefore first 4: zeros.\n\nFirst 4 at 9.\n\nBetween 4s: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,0].\n\nSecond 4 at 19.\n\nAfter second 4: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0].\n\nSo the row becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,4,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nApplying this to all rows in the test input:\n\nFor each row, take the segment between the two 4s, reverse it, and place it after the second 4.\n\nFor example, the first test input row is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe segment between 4s is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Reversed is the same. So output row is the same.\n\nSecond test input row:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSegment between 4s: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]. Reversed: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]. So output row same as input.\n\nThird test input row:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSegment between 4s: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0]. Reversed: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0]. So output same as input.\n\nFourth test input row:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSegment between 4s: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,0]. Reversed: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]. So after second 4, append this reversed segment. The output row becomes:\n\n[...4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,4,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0].\n\nFifth test input row:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSegment between 4s: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. Reversed: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. Output same as input.\n\nSixth test input row:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSegment between 4s: [0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Reversed: [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0]. So after second 4, append this. The output row would have 6 at position 25.\n\nSeventh test input row is all zeros except for the two 4s. So output same as input.\n\nEighth test input row:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSegment between 4s: [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0].
