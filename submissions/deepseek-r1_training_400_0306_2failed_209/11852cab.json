        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these grid examples where the input is transformed into an output. Let me look at each example one by one and see what's changing.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some numbers arranged in a diamond-like shape. The output seems to mirror those numbers outward. Like, in the input's second row, there's a 3 and 8. In the output, those same numbers appear mirrored on the other side of the diamond. So row 1 in the output has 3, 8, and then another 3. Similarly, row 5 (which is symmetric to row 1) gets a mirrored 3, 8, 3. So maybe the pattern is reflecting the existing numbers across the vertical axis of the diamond?\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a sort of vertical structure. The output mirrors the numbers horizontally. For instance, row 2 in the input has 2, 3. The output's row 2 has 2, 3, 2. Similarly, row 6 mirrors row 2. So it's creating a horizontal mirror of the existing elements, extending them to the right and left symmetrically.\n\nExample 2's input has a vertical line of 8s and 4s. The output adds a horizontal component. Like, in row 2 of the input, there's a 4 in the middle. The output adds another 4 to the right, making it a cross. Similarly, row 4 mirrors that. So it's combining the vertical elements into horizontal ones to form a cross.\n\nNow looking at the Test Input. Let's see the structure. Rows 2 and 6 have 1s and 4s. The middle rows (3 and 5) have 2s. Row 4 has a 1 in the middle. The original structure seems vertical. Following the previous examples, the output should mirror these numbers horizontally to create a symmetrical pattern around the center.\n\nSo, for each non-zero number in the input, we need to mirror it across the vertical axis of the diamond. For example, in row 2 of the test input, we have [0,1,0,4,0,1,0,...]. The current elements are at positions 1 and 5 (0-indexed 1 and 5). Mirroring them would place a 1 at position 5 and 1 again. Wait, maybe I need to check how the previous examples handled it.\n\nWait, in example 0, the input row 1 was [0,0,3,0,8,0,0,...], and the output added a 3 in position 6. So the original 3 was at index 2, and the mirrored 3 was at index 6 (since the center is at column 4 and 5 maybe). So the distance from the center is mirrored. For a 10-column grid, the center is between columns 4 and 5. So if a number is at column x, its mirror is at 9 - x.\n\nWait, let's confirm. For example 0's input row 1: the 3 is at index 2 (0-based). The mirrored position would be 9 - 2 = 7. But in the output row 1, the 3 is at index 6. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe the mirroring is around the vertical axis of the diamond's center, which might be at column 4.5 (between 4 and 5). So for each element, it's mirrored across that axis. So for column x, the mirror is 9 - x - 1? Wait, maybe I need to recalculate.\n\nIn example 0, input row 1, the 3 is at column index 2. In the output, the mirrored 3 is at column index 6. 2 and 6 are symmetric around the center (which is at 4.5). So 4.5 - 2 = 2.5, so the mirror would be 4.5 + 2.5 = 7. Wait, that would be 7, but the output is at 6. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the center is column 4.5, so the distance from the center is mirrored. So for column x, mirror is 9 - x. Let's see: 9 - 2 =7. But in the output, it's at 6. So that's not matching. Maybe the mirroring isn't across the entire grid but around the diamond's own axis.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 0's input: the original 3 in row 1 is at position 2. The output adds a 3 at position 6 (same row). So the distance from the center (position 4.5) is 2.5 to the left. So the mirror would be 2.5 to the right, which would be position 4.5 + 2.5 =7. So that's column 7. But in the output, the 3 is at column 6. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero in the input is duplicated to the position that's symmetric relative to the diamond's center. Let's see the diamond's center in example 0. The original diamond is centered around row 3, column 4 and 5. So for each element in the diamond, we mirror it across the vertical axis of the diamond, which is column 4.5. So for each element at (row, col), we also place a mirrored element at (row, 9 - col). Wait, in example 0's input, the 3 in row 1, column 2 (0-based). 9-2=7. So the mirrored column would be 7. But in the output, the 3 is at column 6. Wait, that's not matching. Maybe it's mirrored around the center column (4.5), so the distance from the center is mirrored. So column 2 is 2.5 units left of center. The mirror would be 2.5 units right, which is column 4.5 +2.5 =7 (column 7). But in example 0's output, row 1 has a 3 at column 6 and 8 at column 4, then another 3 at column 6? Wait, in example 0's output row 1: [0,0,3,0,8,0,3,0,0,0]. So columns 2,4,6. Hmm, so the original input had 3 at column 2 and 8 at column 4. The output adds 3 at column 6. So 2 and 6 are symmetric around 4. So for each element not in the center column (4), we mirror it to 8 - col. Because 2 +6 =8. So for column x, mirrored column is 8 -x. Let's check: 8-2=6, which matches. So 3 at column 2 is mirrored to 6. Similarly, in example 1's input row 2 has 2 at column 2 and 3 at column4. The output mirrors 2 to column 5 (8-2=6, but in example1's output row2 is [0,0,2,0,3,0,2,0,...], so columns 2,4,6. Wait, 2 at column2 and 6 (8-2=6). So yes, mirroring across column4. So column x's mirror is 8 -x. Because columns are 0-based up to 9. So the center is between columns4 and5. So 8 -x would be the mirrored position. So for example, x=2 \u2192 6, x=3 \u21925, x=1\u21927, etc.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each non-zero element in the input, we place a mirrored copy at column 8 -x, but only if that position was zero in the input. So the output combines the original elements and their mirrors. But looking at the examples, it seems that the mirrors are added even if the mirrored position had a zero. So for example, in example0's input, row1 has 3 at 2 and 8 at4. The output adds 3 at6 (8-2=6), which was zero in the input. Similarly, in example1's input row2 has 2 at2 and3 at4, the output adds 2 at6 (8-2=6) and 3 at4 remains, then 2 at6. So the transformation is to mirror each non-zero element across the vertical axis (column4.5), creating a symmetric pattern.\n\nSo the rule is: For each cell (row, col) in the input grid, if the value is non-zero, then in the output grid, set both (row, col) and (row, 8 - col) to that value. But if the original cell is already in the mirrored position, like if the original was at 8 - col, then it's already handled. Wait, but how about overlapping? For example, if there's a cell at (row, 3) and another at (row,5), which is 8-3=5. Then both would be mirrored. So maybe the output is the union of all original and mirrored positions.\n\nSo applying this rule to the Test Input. Let's look at each non-zero cell and mirror it.\n\nTest Input rows:\n\nRow 2: [0,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0] (columns 1:1, 3:4,5:1). So mirrored positions would be for column1: 8-1=7; column3:8-3=5; column5:8-5=3.\n\nWait, but in the input row2, column5 is already 1. So mirroring column1 (1) to column7 would add a 1 there. Column3's 4 would be mirrored to column5, but column5 is already 1. Wait, but maybe in the output, the original and mirrored values are both present. Wait, in example0's input, row1 had 3 at2 and8 at4. The mirrored 3 is added at6. So existing zeros are replaced. But in the case where the mirrored position already has a value, which takes precedence? For example, if a cell and its mirror both have values, like in row2 of Test Input, column5 has 1. So the mirror of column5 is column3. But the input column3 has 4. So in the output, column3 and5 would both have 4 and1? But according to the previous examples, the output includes the mirrored values regardless of existing data.\n\nWait, looking at example2's input: row3 has 8 at column3 and1 at column5. The output has row3 as [0,0,0,8,0,1,0,8,0,0]. Wait, the original had 8 at3 and1 at5. The mirror of 8 at3 would be 5 (8-3=5), but there's already a1 there. So in the output, it's kept as is. So maybe the mirroring process doesn't overwrite existing non-zero values. Wait, no. Because in example0's input, row1 had 3 at2 and8 at4. The output row1 has 3 at2,8 at4, and 3 at6. So the original 3 is kept, and the mirrored 3 is added. So perhaps when mirroring, the original values are retained, and the mirrored positions are set to the same value, even if they were zero. But what if the mirrored position already has a different non-zero value? For example, in Test Input row2, column5 is 1. The mirror of column3 (4) is column5. So the output would set column5 to4, overwriting the existing1? That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, but looking at example2's input and output: input row3 is [0,0,0,8,0,1,0,8,0,0]. The output row3 is [0,0,0,8,0,1,0,8,0,0]. So the existing 8 in column3 and7 (8-3=5? Wait, no. Wait, column3 in row3 is 8, 8-3=5. So mirrored position is 5. But in input row3, column5 is 1, which is not 8. The output leaves it as 1. So that suggests that the mirroring process doesn't overwrite existing non-zero values. So if the mirrored position already has a value, it remains. So the rule is: For each non-zero cell (row, col), if the mirrored position (row, 8 - col) is zero in the input, then set it to the same value. If it's non-zero, leave it as is. Wait, but that's not exactly what's happening in the examples.\n\nWait in example0's input row1: columns2 and4 are non-zero. The output adds mirrored columns6 and4 (since 8-2=6 and 8-4=4). Wait, 8-4=4. So the center column is between4 and5. So for column4, the mirrored position is4 (since 8-4=4). So columns4 and5 are mirrored around 4.5. So if a number is at column4, it's mirrored to column5, but in 0-based indexing, columns4 and5 are adjacent. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirroring is done regardless of existing values. So in the output, all mirrored positions are filled with the original value, even if that overwrites existing data. Let's see.\n\nIn example2's input row3, column5 is1. The mirror of column3 (8) is column5. So in the output, column5 would be set to8, overwriting the1. But in the example2 output, column5 remains1. So that contradicts this idea. Therefore, the mirroring process must not overwrite existing non-zero values. Instead, the output is the union of all original non-zero values and their mirrored counterparts. So if a mirrored position already has a non-zero, it's left as is. If it's zero, it's filled with the mirrored value.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFor each cell (row, col) in input:\n\n- If the cell's value is non-zero, add it to the output.\n\n- Also, mirror it to (row, 8 - col) in the output, but only if that position was zero in the input. Otherwise, leave the existing value.\n\nWait, but how do the examples work?\n\nIn example0, input row1 has 3 at2 and8 at4. The output has 3 at6 (8-2=6) which was zero in input. So mirrored. The 8 at4 is mirrored to 4 (8-4=4), which is the same column, so no change. So the 8 remains. Then row5 in the input has 8 at4 (original), which is mirrored to 4 again. But in the output, row5 has mirrored 3s at6 (from row1's 3). Wait, perhaps the mirroring is done for all non-zero cells, and the output combines the original and mirrored cells, even if they overwrite. But example2's input has row3 with 8 at3 and1 at5. If we mirror 8 at3 to5, it would overwrite the1. But in the output, the1 remains. So that suggests that existing non-zero values are not overwritten. Therefore, the rule must be: mirror all non-zero cells, but only add the mirrored value if the mirrored cell was zero in the input. If the mirrored cell already had a value, keep the original one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output combines the original input and its mirrored version. So for each cell in the output, it's the maximum of the original and mirrored input. But that might not fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output for each example and see how it differs from the input.\n\nIn example0's input, the non-zero cells are in rows1-5, forming a diamond. The output adds mirrored cells in rows1 and5 (mirroring row1's cells to the right, row5's cells to the left?), but maybe it's more about reflecting the existing pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a reflection of the input along the vertical axis. Wait, in example0's input, row1 has 3 and8. The output row1 has 3, 8, 3. So it's symmetric. Similarly, row5 in the output becomes symmetric. So the output is making each row symmetric by reflecting non-zero elements.\n\nSo the pattern is: For each row in the input, create a symmetric row by reflecting the non-zero elements across the center vertical axis (columns4.5). So for each element in the row, if there's a non-zero at column x, the output row will have that element and its mirror at column 8 -x. This is done regardless of the original mirrored position's value. Wait, but in example2's input row3 has 8 at3 and1 at5. The mirror of 8 at3 would be at5. But in the output, row3 has 8 at3,1 at5, and8 at7. Wait, the original row3's 8 at3 and1 at5. The mirror of3 is5 (8-3=5). So in the output, the 8 at3 would be mirrored to5, but since5 already has1, that's conflicting. So the output leaves the5 as1 and adds8 at7. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the mirroring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirroring is done per row, creating a symmetric row by duplicating the non-zero elements to their mirrored positions. So even if the mirrored position already had a value, it's overwritten. But in example2's case, the output row3 has 8 at3,1 at5, and8 at7. So original 8 at3 is mirrored to5, but that position had1. So if mirroring overwrites, the5 would become8. But in the output, it's1. So that suggests that the mirroring doesn't overwrite. Therefore, the mirrored value is only added if the mirrored position was zero in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the union of the input and its mirrored version. So if a cell in the input is non-zero, it's kept. Additionally, if the mirrored cell was non-zero in the input, it's kept. Otherwise, the mirrored cell is added. Wait, but how would that work?\n\nAnother approach: Let's compare the input and output of each example.\n\nTake example0's input row1: [0,0,3,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Output row1: [0,0,3,0,8,0,3,0,0,0]. So the 3 at column2 is mirrored to column6. The 8 at column4 stays. So for each non-zero element, we add its mirror.\n\nIn example1's input row2: [0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]. Output row2: [0,0,2,0,3,0,2,0,0,0]. So the 2 at column2 is mirrored to column6, and the3 at4 remains.\n\nIn example2's input row3: [0,0,0,8,0,1,0,8,0,0]. Output row3: same as input. Because mirroring 8 at3 to5 (8-3=5) would overwrite the1 at5, but since the output doesn't change that, perhaps the mirroring is only done for non-zero cells that don't have a mirrored counterpart in the input. Or maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the input and its mirrored version. So each cell is input[row][col] + input[row][8-col]. But let's check.\n\nExample0's row1: input at col2 is3, and at8-2=6 is0. So output is3. But the output has3 at2 and6. So sum doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the input with each row symmetrized by copying the left half to the right half. For example, the input's left side (columns0-4) is mirrored to columns5-9. But in example0's input row1, columns0-4 are [0,0,3,0,8], so the mirror would be [8,0,3,0,0], making row1 [0,0,3,0,8,0,3,0,0,0], which matches the output. Wait, no. Because the left half of row1 (columns0-4) is [0,0,3,0,8], and the mirror would be columns5-9 being [8,0,3,0,0]. But the output row1 is [0,0,3,0,8,0,3,0,0,0]. So columns5-9 are [0,3,0,0,0]. So that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: For each row in the input, the output is the union of the original elements and their mirrored counterparts. So for each non-zero in the row, add its mirror. So in example0's row1, 3 at2 and8 at4. Their mirrors are6 and4. So output has3 at2,8 at4,3 at6. So the 8 at4's mirror is4 again, so no change. So the output includes both original and mirrored positions.\n\nNow looking at example2's input row3: 8 at3,1 at5,8 at7. Mirroring 8 at3 would be5 (8-3=5), but there's a1 there. Mirroring1 at5 would be3 (8-5=3), which already has8. So the output row3 has8 at3,1 at5,8 at7. So the mirrored positions are considered, but existing values are kept. So perhaps the output is a combination of the original and mirrored elements. But when mirrored positions conflict, the original values are retained.\n\nThis suggests that the output is formed by taking the original input and adding the mirrored non-zero cells, but not overwriting existing non-zero cells. So for each cell (row, col) in input, if it's non-zero, then in the output, both (row, col) and (row, 8 - col) are set to that value. But if (row, 8 - col) already has a value in the input, it remains. Wait, but in example0's input row1, column6 is0, so mirrored 3 is added. In example2's input row3, column5 is1, so mirroring 8 from column3 would set column5 to8, but in the output, it's1. So this contradicts that idea. So perhaps the output is not just adding mirrored elements but creating a symmetric pattern by mirroring the existing non-zero elements, regardless of the mirrored positions' original values. So even if there's a value already there, it's overwritten with the mirrored value.\n\nBut in example2's output row3, column5 is still1, which was in the input. So that's not the case. Therefore, the rule must be that the output is the input plus the mirrored input, but only adding where there were zeros. So the mirrored cells are added only to positions that were zero in the input. Existing non-zero cells are left as is.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. For each cell (row, col) in the input:\n\n   a. If the value is non-zero, keep it in the output.\n\n   b. Also, check the mirrored cell (row, 8 - col). If that cell in the input is zero, then set it to the same value as (row, col) in the output.\n\nBut how about if the mirrored cell in the input is non-zero? Then we don't change it.\n\nWait, let's test this with example2.\n\nIn example2's input row3:\n\n- column3 is8, input's mirrored cell is column5 (8-3=5), which is1. Since column5 is non-zero, we don't add anything. So output column3 remains8, column5 remains1.\n\n- column7 is8 in input. Mirrored cell is column1 (8-7=1), which is0. So we add8 to column1? But in the output row3, column7 is8 and column1 is0. Wait, that's not matching. So maybe the mirrored cell is added only for the original non-zero cells, not for the mirrored ones.\n\nAlternatively, the process is:\n\n- For each non-zero cell in the input, add its mirror in the output. Even if that mirror cell is already non-zero in the input.\n\nBut in example2's input row3, the cell at column7 is8. Its mirror is column1 (8-7=1), which is0. So in the output, we add8 at column1. But in the example2's output row3, column1 is0. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps the mirroring is only done for certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the input with each row symmetrized around the center. So each row in the output is the input row's elements plus their mirrored counterparts. For example, in example0's input row1: [0,0,3,0,8,0,0,0,0,0], the output is [0,0,3,0,8,0,3,0,0,0]. So the 3 is mirrored to column6. The 8 remains in column4. So the output row is symmetric.\n\nSo the rule could be: each row in the output is the input row made symmetric by adding the mirrored non-zero elements. So for each element in the input row, if it's non-zero, add it to its mirrored position in the output row. The output row is the combination of the original and mirrored elements.\n\nBut then in example2's input row3, which is [0,0,0,8,0,1,0,8,0,0], the output row3 is the same as input. But if we make it symmetric, then column5 would need to have8 (mirror of column3) and column3 would have8. But the input has1 at5. So the output would have8 at3 and5, but the input's1 is there. So this suggests that the mirrored elements overwrite existing values. But in the example output, the1 remains. So this contradicts.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a different approach.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nIn each example, the output is a symmetric version of the input. So for each non-zero element in the input, the output has that element and its mirror. For example, in example0's input, there's a vertical diamond. The output adds horizontal elements to make a symmetric cross. Similarly, example1's input has a vertical structure, and the output makes it a horizontal cross.\n\nAh, perhaps the pattern is that the output is a combination of the original input and its reflection across the vertical axis. So for each element in the input, we have it and its mirror in the output. So the output is the union of the input and its mirror image.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's input row1: [0,0,3,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. The mirror image of this row would be [0,0,0,0,8,0,3,0,0,0]. The union (taking maximum values) would be [0,0,3,0,8,0,3,0,0,0], which matches the output row1.\n\nExample1's input row2: [0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]. Mirror image is [0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0]. Union gives [0,0,2,0,3,0,2,0,0,0], which matches the output.\n\nExample2's input row3: [0,0,0,8,0,1,0,8,0,0]. Mirror image would be [0,0,0,8,0,1,0,8,0,0] (since it's already symmetric except for the 1 and8. Wait, mirroring row3 would flip the elements. So original row3 is columns0-9:\n\n0,0,0,8,0,1,0,8,0,0.\n\nMirroring across vertical axis (columns 4.5):\n\nThe mirror of column0 is9, column1 is8, etc.\n\nSo mirrored row would be:\n\n0,0,0,8,0,1,0,8,0,0 \u2192 mirror \u2192 0,0,0,8,0,1,0,8,0,0. Because 8 is at3 and7, and1 is at5. So mirroring this row would swap columns3 and5, which would change the 8 and1. Wait, but the mirrored row of the original row3 would be:\n\nOriginal indexes: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \u2192 values: 0,0,0,8,0,1,0,8,0,0.\n\nMirrored indexes: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 \u2192 values: 0,0,8,0,1,0,8,0,0,0.\n\nSo the mirrored row would be [0,0,8,0,1,0,8,0,0,0].\n\nThe union of original and mirrored rows:\n\nOriginal: [0,0,0,8,0,1,0,8,0,0]\n\nMirrored: [0,0,8,0,1,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nCombining (taking maximum for each column):\n\nColumn0: 0, column1:0, column2:8 (from mirrored), column3:8 (original), column4:1 (original), column5:1 (original) (mirrored has 0 here?), wait no. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal row3's columns:\n\n0:0, 1:0, 2:0,3:8,4:0,5:1,6:0,7:8,8:0,9:0.\n\nMirrored row (columns 0-9):\n\nOriginal column9 \u21920 becomes mirrored column0:0\n\nOriginal column8\u21920 \u2192 mirrored column1:0\n\nOriginal column7\u21928 \u2192 mirrored column2:8\n\nOriginal column6\u21920 \u2192 mirrored column3:0\n\nOriginal column5\u21921 \u2192 mirrored column4:1\n\nOriginal column4\u21920 \u2192 mirrored column5:0\n\nOriginal column3\u21928 \u2192 mirrored column6:8\n\nOriginal column2\u21920 \u2192 mirrored column7:0\n\nOriginal column1\u21920 \u2192 mirrored column8:0\n\nOriginal column0\u21920 \u2192 mirrored column9:0.\n\nSo mirrored row is:\n\n[0,0,8,0,1,0,8,0,0,0].\n\nCombining original and mirrored:\n\nFor each column, take the non-zero value if present.\n\nColumns0: 0 (both)\n\nColumn1:0 (both)\n\nColumn2:0 (original) and8 (mirrored) \u2192 8\n\nColumn3:8 (original) and0 (mirrored) \u21928\n\nColumn4:0 (original) and1 (mirrored) \u21921\n\nColumn5:1 (original) and0 (mirrored) \u21921\n\nColumn6:0 (original) and8 (mirrored) \u21928\n\nColumn7:8 (original) and0 (mirrored) \u21928\n\nColumns8 and9:0.\n\nSo combined row would be [0,0,8,8,1,1,8,8,0,0]. But in example2's output row3, it's [0,0,0,8,0,1,0,8,0,0], which doesn't match. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is not simply mirroring each row. Let's look at the examples again.\n\nExample0's input has a vertical diamond. The output makes it a horizontal diamond by adding mirrored elements. So the output is a combination of the vertical and horizontal diamonds, forming a cross.\n\nExample1's input is a vertical structure, and the output adds horizontal elements to make a cross.\n\nExample2's input has vertical elements and a horizontal line. The output adds horizontal elements to the vertical parts.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is to mirror the entire structure along the vertical axis, creating a cross.\n\nBut how does this apply to each cell?\n\nAnother approach: For each non-zero cell in the input, add a mirrored cell at (row, 8 - col) in the output. The output is the union of the original and mirrored cells, regardless of existing values. So if a cell and its mirror are both non-zero in the input, both are retained. If a cell's mirror is zero in the input, the mirrored value is added.\n\nApplying this to example2's input row3: column3 has8, mirror is5. In the input, column5 has1. So in the output, both8 and1 are kept. Column7 has8, mirror is1 (8-7=1), which is zero in input, so8 is added to column1. But in the output, row3 is [0,0,0,8,0,1,0,8,0,0], which doesn't have8 at column1. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirroring is done for each non-zero cell, but only for certain rows. For example, in example0, the input's diamond is in rows1-5. The output adds mirrored elements in rows1 and5, creating a symmetric pattern.\n\nLooking at the Test Input: it has non-zero elements in rows2,3,4,5,6. The input's structure is a vertical diamond (rows2-6). According to the pattern from the examples, the output should mirror each of these rows horizontally to form a cross.\n\nSo for each non-zero in these rows, we add the mirror in the same row.\n\nTest Input row2: [0,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nMirroring each element:\n\n1 at column1 \u2192 mirror at7.\n\n4 at column3 \u2192 mirror at5.\n\n1 at column5 \u2192 mirror at3.\n\nSo the mirrored elements would be:\n\nAdd 1 at7, 4 at5, 1 at3.\n\nBut the input row2 already has1 at5 and4 at3. Wait, mirroring column3 (4) would set column5 to4, but the input already has1 there. So in the output, does that 1 get replaced by4? Or do we keep both?\n\nAccording to example2's output, when there's a conflict, the original value is retained. So maybe in the output, the mirrored value is only added if the position is zero. So for Test Input row2:\n\nOriginal non-zero positions: 1 (col1),4 (col3),1 (col5).\n\nMirrored positions: 7 (1),5 (3),3 (5).\n\nSo mirrored values:\n\n1 at7,4 at5,1 at3.\n\nBut in the input:\n\ncol3 is4, which is mirrored to5 (input col5 is1). So mirrored4 would be added to5, but since there's already a1 there, it would remain1.\n\nSo output row2 would have:\n\ncol1:1, col3:4, col5:1, col7:1, col3:1 (from mirroring col5's1).\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to apply the rule: for each non-zero cell in the input, add its mirror. So regardless of existing values in the mirrored positions.\n\nTest Input row2:\n\nElements at (2,1)=1, (2,3)=4, (2,5)=1.\n\nMirrors:\n\n(2,7)=1 (mirror of1 at1), (2,5)=4 (mirror of4 at3), (2,3)=1 (mirror of1 at5).\n\nSo the output row2 would have:\n\noriginal values at1:1,3:4,5:1.\n\nPlus mirrored values at7:1,5:4,3:1.\n\nBut how do these combine? If overlapping, which value is taken?\n\nIn example0's input row1, the mirrored3 at6 is added to the existing0. So the output has3 there. In example1's input row2, the mirrored2 at6 is added. So overlapping zero cells are filled.\n\nBut when mirrored cells conflict with existing non-zero values, like in Test Input row2's column3 (4) and its mirror from column5 (1), which would be at column3. So mirroring column5's1 to column3 would set column3 to1, but the input already has4 there. So according to example2's case, existing values are retained. So in the output, column3 would remain4, and column5 would remain1, but their mirrored values (from3 and5) would set column5 and3 to4 and1, respectively. So it's a conflict.\n\nThis suggests that the mirroring process overwrites existing values. So the output is the union of original and mirrored values, with the mirrored values taking precedence where they overlap. But that doesn't align with example2's output, where column5 remains1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirroring is only applied to certain rows. For example, in the examples, the mirrored rows are those that are part of the diamond. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the examples, I think the correct approach is to mirror each non-zero element in the input to its mirrored column (8 - col) in the same row, creating a symmetric row. The output combines the original and mirrored elements, overwriting zeros but leaving existing non-zero values intact. So if a mirrored position was zero in the input, it's filled with the mirrored value. If it was non-zero, it remains.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nOriginal non-zero elements at columns1,3,5.\n\nMirroring:\n\n-1 at1 \u2192 mirrored to7 (8-1=7), which is zero \u2192 set to1.\n\n-4 at3 \u2192 mirrored to5 (8-3=5), which is1 \u2192 remains1.\n\n-1 at5 \u2192 mirrored to3 (8-5=3), which is4 \u2192 remains4.\n\nSo output row2 will have1 at1,3,5,7. Also, the original4 at3 and1 at5.\n\nWait, no. The mirrored values are added to the output, but if the mirrored position already has a non-zero, it stays. So:\n\nAfter mirroring:\n\nRow2 will have:\n\nOriginal elements:\n\n1 at1,4 at3,1 at5.\n\nMirrored elements:\n\n1 at7,4 at5 (but input has1 there, so it remains1),1 at3 (input has4 there, remains4).\n\nSo output row2 becomes [0,1,0,4,0,1,0,1,0,0].\n\nBut wait, the mirrored4 from column3 would be at5, but input has1 there. So 5 stays1. The mirrored1 from5 is at3, which has4, so it stays4. The mirrored1 from1 is at7, which is zero, so added as1.\n\nThus, row2 output: [0,1,0,4,0,1,0,1,0,0].\n\nRow3: input is [0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nOriginal non-zero elements at2 and4.\n\nMirroring:\n\n2 at2 \u2192 mirrored to6 (8-2=6).\n\n2 at4 \u2192 mirrored to4 (8-4=4) \u2192 same position.\n\nSo output row3: [0,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,0,0].\n\nRow4: input [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nNon-zero at3.\n\nMirrored to5 (8-3=5).\n\nSo output row4: [0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow5: input [0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. Same as row3. Output will be same as row3's output.\n\nRow6: input [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. Similar to row2. Mirroring:\n\n1 at1 \u21927.\n\n1 at5 \u21923 (8-5=3). But row6's input column3 is0.\n\nSo output row6: [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0].\n\nPutting it all together, the output should have:\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,4,0,1,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0]\n\nOther rows remain zeros.\n\nBut let's check if this matches the examples' patterns. For example, in example0's row1, the output added the mirrored elements. Here, in row2 of the test input, we have added 1s at7 and5 (but 5 was already1). So the output row2 would have 1s at1,5,7 and4 at3. Wait, but the mirroring process added 1 at7 and4 at5 (original column3's4 is mirrored to5, but5 was1. So5 remains1. So row2's output should be:\n\n[0,1,0,4,0,1,0,1,0,0]\n\nYes.\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut wait, in row6's input, column5 is1. Mirroring to column3 (8-5=3) which is0 in the input, so output row6 column3 becomes1. So the row6 output is [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0].\n\nYes. This seems to fit the pattern observed in the training examples.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids based on the given examples, then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by analyzing each training example carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input has some numbers arranged in a certain way. The output seems to add some numbers. For instance, in row 1 of the input, there's a 3 and an 8. In the output, there's another 3 added on the same row but shifted. Similarly, in row 5 of the input, there's an 8, and the output adds a 3 there. Hmm. Maybe there's a reflection or mirroring happening here. Let me check the positions.\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 1 (index 1) has 3 at position 2 and 8 at position 4. The output row 1 has 3 at position 6 now. So, maybe the row is being mirrored around the center. Since the row has 10 elements, the center is between positions 4 and 5. So, position 2's mirror would be position 7 (since 10-2-1=7). Wait, but 2 mirrored would be 7? Let me see. For a 0-indexed array of length 10, the mirror of index i would be 9 - i. So position 2 (third element) would mirror to position 6 (9-2=7, but maybe I'm miscalculating). Wait, let's confirm. For a row of length 10, indices 0-9. The center is between index 4 and 5. So mirroring around the vertical center line. So for each cell at (row, col), the mirrored column would be 9 - col. So, for example, in the input row 1, the 3 is at column 2. The mirrored position would be column 7 (9-2=7). But in the output, the 3 is added at column 6. Wait, that doesn't match. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the mirroring. Let's check another element. The 8 in row 1, column 4. Its mirror would be column 5 (9-4=5?), but in the output row 1, column 4 is 8, and column 5 is 0. Hmm, maybe not a vertical mirror. Alternatively, maybe it's a horizontal mirror. Wait, but the rows are the same in input and output. So perhaps the pattern is to mirror the non-zero elements in a certain way, but only in specific rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by copying certain elements from other rows. Let's look at Example 0's output. The first row (input) was all zeros. The output row 1 has 3, 8, 3. Wait, the input row 1 had 3, 8. Output row 1 now has 3,8,3. So maybe the 3 is mirrored on both sides. So the 3 is at column 2 and column 6 (mirror around column 4). Because 2 is two positions left of center (columns 4 and 5), so mirroring would place it at 6 (since 4 + (4-2) =6). Wait, maybe the center is between 4 and 5. So for each element left of center, place a copy on the right side. So for element at column c where c <4 (0-based), the mirrored column is 9 - c. But in the input row 1, the 3 is at column 2, mirrored to 7 (9-2=7). But in the output, the 3 is at column 6. Hmm, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is to reflect the non-zero elements in a diamond shape. Looking at the input in Example 0, the numbers form a diamond-like structure. The output adds another layer to the diamond. For instance, in the input, the 3 and 8 are in the middle rows, and the output adds more 3s and 8s in adjacent rows. Wait, in the input, row 1 has 3 and 8, row 3 has 8 and 3, row 5 has 8. The output adds in row 5 a 3. So maybe each non-zero element is being replicated in a symmetrical way. Alternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and reflecting it vertically, creating a symmetrical pattern. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the non-zero elements form a diamond shape. The output seems to extend that diamond. For example, the original diamond is from rows 1 to 5, and the output adds mirrored elements in rows 5 and 1. Wait, in the input, row 1 has 3 and 8, row 5 has 8. The output row 5 has 3 and 8. So maybe the pattern is to mirror the entire diamond structure around the middle row. The middle row here is row 3 (since the grid is 10 rows, middle is between 4 and 5, but perhaps considering the structure). Alternatively, maybe each non-zero element in a certain position is being replicated in the corresponding mirrored position. For instance, in the input, the 3 in row 1, column 2. The output adds a 3 in row 1, column 6. So 2 and 6 are symmetric around column 4.5. Let's calculate: 2 is at distance 2.5 from the center (which is between 4 and 5). Wait, columns are 0-9. The center is between 4.5. So the distance from 2 to 4.5 is 2.5, so the mirrored position would be 4.5 + (4.5 - 2) = 7. So column 7. But in the output, the 3 is at column 6. Hmm, that doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe the mirroring is around the vertical axis. For example, column 2 mirrors to column 7 (since 9-2=7). But in Example 0's output, the 3 is at column 6. So that doesn't fit. So maybe another approach.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input has a diamond-like structure again. The output adds elements in rows 2 and 6. For example, in the input row 2, there's a 2 and 3. The output row 2 now has 2,3,2. So again, mirroring the elements symmetrically. The 2 is at column 2, mirrored to column 6 (9-2=7? But column 6 is index 6). Wait, 2 and 6 would be symmetric around column 4.5. 2 and 7 would be symmetric around 4.5. But in the output, the 2 is at column 6. So maybe the mirroring is not exact, but perhaps the pattern is to take the non-zero elements from the left half and mirror them to the right, but only if they are in certain rows. Or perhaps it's a reflection across the middle vertical line, but not exact. Alternatively, maybe the output is created by adding the non-zero elements from the input in a way that creates symmetry in each row. For example, in Example 0's input row 1: [0,0,3,0,8,0,0,0,0,0], the output row 1 becomes [0,0,3,0,8,0,3,0,0,0]. So the 3 is added on the right side. Similarly, the 8 remains in the middle. So perhaps for each row, the non-zero elements are mirrored around the center. So any non-zero in the left half is copied to the right half, and vice versa. But in Example 0's input row 1, the 3 is at column 2 (left half), and the output adds a 3 at column 6 (right half). Similarly, the 8 is in column 4 (left of center? No, column 4 is left of center (4.5). Wait, column 4 is the fifth element (0-based), which is left of the center between 4 and 5. So the mirror would be column 5. But the 8 is in column 4 in input row1, and in output it's still at 4. But maybe the 8 is in the center, so it's not mirrored. Wait, in output row1, the 3 is at column 2 and 6, symmetric around column 4.5 (since 2 and 7 would be symmetric, but 6 is 4.5 + 1.5, while 2 is 4.5 - 2.5). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that each non-zero element in the input is part of a cross or diamond structure, and the output adds the next layer outward. For example, in Example 0's input, there's a diamond with 3 and 8. The output adds a layer that includes another 3 in row 5. Maybe the pattern is that the output creates a symmetric diamond by reflecting the existing elements in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the positions where numbers are added. In Example 0's output, the added 3 is in row 5, column 2 and 6. Wait, no, in the output, row5 has 3s at columns 0 and 6? Wait no, the output for Example 0's row5 is [0,0,3,0,8,0,3,0,0,0]. Wait, no, in the output of Example0's row5 (index5) is [0,0,3,0,8,0,3,0,0,0]. Wait, the input row5 (index5) was [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. So in output, they added 3s in columns 2 and 6. So 8 is in column4. So 2 and 6 are symmetric around column4. So perhaps each non-zero element in the input is mirrored in the same row, but on the opposite side of the center column (column4.5). For example, 3 is at column2, so mirror to column7 (9-2=7), but in Example0's output, it's at column6. Hmm, maybe the center is column4.5, so the distance from column2 to center is 2.5, so mirror position is 4.5 +2.5=7. But in output, it's at 6. That discrepancy is confusing. Maybe the mirroring is done in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are mirrored vertically, creating a symmetrical pattern in the grid. For instance, the input's diamond structure is mirrored up and down, adding layers. Let's look at the structure of Example0. Input has a diamond centered at row3, column4. The output adds another layer to the diamond. So the input's diamond has layers at rows 1,3,5 (assuming diamond shape). The output adds layers at rows 1 and 5, perhaps expanding the diamond. But this is a bit vague. Let me check another example.\n\nExample1's input has a structure in rows2,3,4,5,6. The output adds mirrored elements in rows2 and6. So in the input row2, the elements are at columns2 and4 (2 and3). Output row2 has elements at 2,4,6 (2,3,2). So mirroring the left elements to the right. Similarly, row6 in the output has 2,4,6 (2,3,2). So the pattern here is that each row in the input's central diamond is mirrored left-right, adding the mirrored elements. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each non-zero element in the input and copying it to the position that is its horizontal mirror (around the vertical center of the grid) if that position is zero. For example, in Example0's row1, column2 has a3. The mirror position is column7 (9-2=7). But in the output, the3 is added at column6. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the mirroring is around the vertical center line, but the grid is split into left and right, and non-zero elements in the left are mirrored on the right. So for columns 0-4, their mirror is 9 - column. So column2 would mirror to column7. But in Example0's output row1, the3 is at column6. That doesn't fit. So maybe another approach.\n\nLooking at the numbers added in the outputs. For Example0, the added numbers are 3 and 8 in the same row. For Example1, the added numbers are 2 and 3. For Example2, the output adds 4s in row2 and4. Let's see if there's a mathematical relation between the numbers. For instance, in Example0's output row5, the added 3s could be related to the 8 in the same row. 3+8+3=14. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are arranged in a way that their sum in certain positions is consistent. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers in the output are the sum of adjacent cells in the input, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking each non-zero element and placing a copy of it in the same row but mirrored across the center. For example, in Example0's row1, input has 3 and8. The output adds a3 on the right side. So 3 is mirrored, 8 remains. Wait, 8 is in the center, so it's not mirrored. So perhaps for each non-zero element in the left half of the row, we place a copy in the right half's corresponding position. So column2 (left) would mirror to column7 (right), but in Example0's output, the3 is at column6. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the mirroring is done in such a way that each non-zero element is mirrored to the opposite side of the center column, but not necessarily the exact mirror. For instance, in Example0's row1, 3 is at column2. The center is between column4 and5. The distance from column2 to the center is 2.5 (since 4.5 -2=2.5). So the mirrored position would be 4.5 +2.5=7, which is column7. But in the output, it's at column6. So that's not matching. Maybe the mirroring is done in a different way. \n\nWait, looking at Example2's input and output. The input has in row1: 8s at columns3,5,7. The output row1 is the same. But row2 in input has 4 at column4, and output row2 has 4 at column4 and column6. So mirrored. So for even columns? Column4's mirror is column5, but in the output, it's at column6. Hmm, no. Alternatively, the 4 in column4 is mirrored to column5 (center between 4 and5), but that would be column5. But in the output, it's column6. So perhaps the mirroring is column c to 9 - c. For column4, 9-4=5. So 4 mirrored to5, but in output, it's at6. That's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a vertical reflection of the entire grid. But in Example0's input, row1 has 3 and8. The mirrored row1 would have 8 and3, but that's not the case. The output has 3,8,3. So perhaps not a vertical reflection. \n\nWait, perhaps the output is created by taking each row and making it symmetric. For example, in the input row, if there's a non-zero element on the left, add a copy on the right. So for row1 in Example0's input, which has 3 and8, the output becomes 3,8,3. So making the row symmetric. But how? The original row is [0,0,3,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is [0,0,3,0,8,0,3,0,0,0]. So it's symmetric around the 8. So the 3 is added to the right side. Similarly, in Example1's input row2: [0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] becomes [0,0,2,0,3,0,2,0,0,0]. So mirroring the 2 to the right. So the pattern is: for each row, make it symmetric by adding mirrored non-zero elements on the right side. So any non-zero element in the left half (columns 0-4) is mirrored to the right half (columns5-9), but placed symmetrically around the center. For example, column2's mirror would be column7 (since 9-2=7). But in Example0's output, the3 is at column6. Wait, maybe it's not the exact mirror, but the mirror around the center of the row. Let's calculate the center for a 10-element row, which is between column4 and5. So the mirror of column2 would be column7 (since 4.5 + (4.5 - 2) =7). But in Example0's output, the3 is at column6, which is not7. So this doesn't align. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to take each non-zero element in the input row and place it in the same row but mirrored across the vertical center. For example, if a non-zero is at column c, then also place it at column (9 - c). But in Example0's row1, the3 is at2, so mirrored to7. But the output has3 at6. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by copying the non-zero elements from the input and their mirrored positions, but only if the mirrored position is zero. So for each non-zero in the input, check its mirror position. If that position is zero, copy the value there. For example, in Example0's row1, the3 is at2. The mirror at7 is zero, so copy3 to7. But in the output, it's placed at6. Hmm. This doesn't fit. \n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is more about creating a diamond structure where each layer is mirrored. For example, in Example0's input, the diamond has layers at rows1,2,3,4,5. The output adds layers at row5 and1, making it more symmetric. Or perhaps the output is reflecting the entire diamond structure vertically. For instance, the input's upper half is mirrored to the lower half. But in Example0's output, the added elements are in row5, which is below the original diamond. Maybe the pattern is to take the input's diamond and create a mirror image below and above. But Example0's input already has a symmetric diamond, so why the output adds more? \n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each non-zero element in the input is part of a certain pattern, and the output completes that pattern. For example, in Example0's input, the elements form a diamond with certain values. The output adds elements to complete the diamond. For instance, the input has a diamond with 3 and8, and the output adds another layer of 3s around it. \n\nAnother angle: looking at the positions of the added elements. In Example0's output, the added 3s are in row1 and5. The original input has 3 in row1, and 8 in row3. The output adds 3s in row5. So maybe the pattern is to mirror rows around the middle row. The middle row is row4.5 (since there are 10 rows, indices 0-9). So row1's mirror is row8, but in the output, the added elements are in row5. Hmm, not matching. \n\nWait, perhaps the output is generated by taking each non-zero element and creating a cross shape around it. For example, a 3 in row1, column2 would lead to adding a3 in row1, column6 (right), and perhaps above and below. But in Example0's output, the3 in row1, column6 is added. Maybe only horizontal mirroring. \n\nAlternatively, think about the grid as a 2D array and look for patterns in the numbers. For Example0's input and output:\n\nInput rows (indices 0-9):\n\nRow1: [0,0,3,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,8,0,3,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow1: [0,0,3,0,8,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,3,0,8,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 3s are added to row1 and row5, making them symmetric. So maybe each row that has non-zero elements is mirrored in the corresponding row equidistant from the center. For example, row1 and row5 are symmetric around row3. So if row1 has a3, then row5 should have a3. But in the input, row5 has an8, so the output adds a3. Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero element in the input is part of a diamond, and the output completes the diamond by adding the missing elements. For example, in Example0, the diamond in the input has a certain size, and the output adds the next layer. But I'm not exactly sure how the diamond is structured. \n\nLet me try to think of another approach. Let's list the changes between input and output for each example.\n\nIn Example0:\n\n- In row1 (index1), added 3 at column6.\n- In row5 (index5), added 3s at columns2 and6.\n- Other rows remain the same except for these additions.\n\nIn Example1:\n\n- In row2 (index2), added 2 at column6 and 3 at column4?\nWait, input row2 has [0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0], output becomes [0,0,2,0,3,0,2,0,0,0]. So added a 2 at column6.\n- In row6 (index6), added 2 at columns2 and6. Original row6 was [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0], output is [0,0,2,0,3,0,2,0,0,0].\n\nSo in both examples, the output adds elements that mirror the left elements to the right side of the same row. For instance, in Example1's row2, the 2 at column2 is mirrored to column6.\n\nSimilarly, in Example2's input row2 has [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0], output adds 4 at column6. So mirroring the 4 from column4 to column6. Wait, that's not symmetric. Column4's mirror should be column5 if mirrored around the center. But 4 is in column4, mirrored to column5. But in the output, it's at column6. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the mirroring is done such that each non-zero element is mirrored across the center column (4.5). So for column c, the mirrored column is 9 - c. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0's input row1, column2 has 3. Mirror is 9-2=7. Output row1 has 3 at column6. That's not 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nIn Example1's input row2, column2 has 2. Mirror is 7. Output row2 has 2 at column6. Again, not matching.\n\nIn Example2's input row2, column4 has4. Mirror would be5. Output row2 has4 at6. Hmm, not matching.\n\nSo that theory is incorrect. Maybe the mirroring is different. Perhaps for each non-zero element, the mirrored column is (center_column *2) - original_col. For a 10-column grid, center is between 4 and5. So center at 4.5. So mirrored_col = 9 - original_col. Wait, that's the same as previous. Doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by creating a horizontal reflection of the entire grid. But that would flip the rows, which doesn't align with the examples.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where elements are added. In each example, the added elements are in the same row but on the opposite side of the center. For example, in Example0's row1, the 3 is added at column6 (which is 6-4=2 to the right of center). The original 3 is at column2 (4-2=2 to the left). So they are symmetric. But the calculation is 4.5 -2 =2.5, so mirrored would be 4.5 +2.5=7, but the output is at6. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe the center is considered at column5 for even-length rows? No, 10 columns are indexed 0-9. Middle columns are 4 and5. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirroring is done with respect to the middle element. For example, in a row with 10 elements, the middle is between the 5th and6th elements (indices4 and5). So for any element at position c, the mirrored position is 9 - c. So for column2, mirrored is7. But in Example0's output, the3 is at6. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirroring is only applied to certain rows. Like, for every row that has non-zero elements, mirror the left non-zero elements to the right. But how to determine which rows to apply this.\n\nLooking at Example0's input, the non-zero rows are rows1,2,3,4,5. The output adds non-zero elements in rows1 and5. Similarly, in Example1's input, non-zero rows are2,3,4,5,6. Output adds elements in rows2 and6. So the pattern is that the outermost rows of the diamond (top and bottom) have their elements mirrored. For example, the top row (row1 in Example0) and bottom row (row5) have elements mirrored. Similarly, in Example1, the top row of the diamond is row2 and bottom row6. So the output mirrors the elements in these outermost rows. \n\nSo maybe the pattern is: For the topmost and bottommost rows of the diamond structure in the input, mirror their non-zero elements horizontally in the same row. For the middle rows, no change. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nExample0's input has a diamond where the topmost row is row1 and bottommost row5. The output mirrors their elements. So row1's 3 at column2 is mirrored to column6. Row5's 8 is in column4, so no mirroring needed. But wait, in the output row5, there are 3s at columns2 and6. But the input row5 only has8. So this theory doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirroring is applied to all rows that are part of the diamond. For example, each row in the diamond has its elements mirrored. So in Example0's input rows1-5, each non-zero element is mirrored. But in the output, some rows have mirrored elements, others don't. For example, row3 in Example0's input has 8,0,3,0,8. Output row3 is the same. So this theory doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to find a commonality in all examples.\n\nAnother observation: In each example, the output has a more symmetric diamond structure compared to the input. For instance, in Example0's input, the diamond has 3 and8 in row1, but output adds another 3 on the right. Similarly, in Example1's input, the diamond's top and bottom rows (rows2 and6) have their elements mirrored. So the pattern could be that the input is a diamond missing certain symmetric elements, and the output completes them.\n\nBut how to determine which elements to add. Looking at Example0's input row1: [0,0,3,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Output row1: [0,0,3,0,8,0,3,0,0,0]. So the 3 is added at column6. Similarly, the input row5 has an8, and the output row5 adds3s. So perhaps the 3 is part of a different layer of the diamond. \n\nAlternatively, think of the numbers as layers. For example, in Example0, the input has a diamond with 3s and8s. The output adds another layer of3s around the existing diamond. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, each number in the input is part of a certain pattern that is expanded in the output. For example, the 3s in Example0's input are in row1, column2 and row3, column0 (wait no). Maybe the output expands the3s to form a larger pattern.\n\nAnother approach: Compare the input and output for each cell. For each cell that changes from zero to non-zero in the output, what determines its value? For Example0's output row1, column6 is3. What's the relation to the input? Let's see:\n\nInput row1, column2 is3. Maybe the output's column6 is the same as column2. So mirroring. But why column6?\n\nSimilarly, in Example1's output row2, column6 is2, which matches input row2's column2. Again, mirroring.\n\nIn Example2's output row2, column6 is4, which matches input row2's column4. So mirroring column4 to column6. But why? Because 4 to6 is two steps to the right. So for even-numbered columns?\n\nWait, in Example2's input row2: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]. Output row2: [0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0]. So the4 is mirrored to column6, which is two columns to the right. Hmm. So perhaps for each non-zero element in the left half (columns0-4), we add a copy to the right half, two columns to the right. For example, column2 would be mirrored to column6 (2+4=6). Because if the center is between columns4 and5, then columns0-4 are on the left, and columns5-9 are on the right. So column0's mirror would be5, column1\u21926, column2\u21927, column3\u21928, column4\u21929. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nIn Example0's input row1, column2 is3. According to this, mirror would be7, but output has6. In Example1's row2, column2 is2, mirrored to6. Which fits. Example2's row2, column4 is4, mirrored to6 (4+2=6). So perhaps there's a pattern where each non-zero element in the left half is copied to column (c +4). For example, column2\u21926 (2+4=6). Column4\u21928. But in Example2's case, column4\u21926. So this theory is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirroring is such that the left part is duplicated to the right, but shifted by two columns. For example, columns0-4 are copied to columns5-9, but shifted by1. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking each non-zero element and adding a copy two columns to the right. For example, in Example0's row1, column2 has3. Add a3 at column4 (2+2=4). But in the output, it's added at6. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output adds elements that are two columns to the right of the original, but wrapping around. Doesn't seem likely.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the positions where new elements are added. In Example0's output, the new 3 in row1 is at column6, which is symmetric to column2 with respect to column4 (the fifth element). Column2 and column6 are both two positions away from column4. So the distance from column4 to column2 is2, and to column6 is also2. So mirroring around column4. So for any element in column c, mirrored to (2*4 -c). For example, c=2 \u21928 -2 =6. Yes, 2*4=8, 8-2=6. So for column c, mirrored to (8 -c). That works for Example0's row1, where 2\u21926. For Example1's row2, column2\u21926. Example2's row2, column4\u21924 (8-4=4), but in the output, it's added at6. So that doesn't fit. So this theory only works for columns less than4. \n\nWait, in Example2's row2, the input has a4 at column4. If mirrored around column4, then it would stay at4, but the output has it at6. So that doesn't fit. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe the mirroring is around column5. For example, mirrored column is (10 -1 -c) =9 -c. So for column2, mirrored is7. But in the examples, it's added at6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to find another pattern. Let's look at the values. In Example0's output, the added 3s are in rows1 and5. The original 3s are in rows1 and3. So maybe the pattern is to copy the value from the row above and below. For instance, row1's 3 is copied to row5. But in the output, row5 has3, which wasn't there in the input. \n\nAlternatively, the output's added numbers are the same as the numbers in the row that's symmetric with respect to the middle row. For Example0, middle row is between4 and5. So row1's symmetric row is row8 (9-1=8), but the output adds to row5. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the sum of the numbers in each row. For Example0's input row1:3+8=11. Output row1:3+8+3=14. Not sure. Example1's input row2:2+3=5. Output row2:2+3+2=7. Also not obvious. Example2's input row2:4. Output row2:4+4=8. Hmm. No clear pattern here.\n\nWait, maybe the output is created by adding the same number that is present in the adjacent rows. For example, in Example0's row1, the3 and8 are present, and row3 has8 and3. So adding 3s in row1 and5. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the diamond structure. Each diamond has a center. For Example0, the center is row3, column4 (since there's an8 and3 in row3). The input's diamond has values that decrease as you move away from the center. The output adds another layer. But in Example0's input, the layers are:\n\nRow1:3,8\n\nRow2:2,2\n\nRow3:8,3,8\n\nRow4:2,2\n\nRow5:8\n\nThe output adds:\n\nRow1:3,8,3\n\nRow5:3,8,3\n\nSo the pattern could be that each layer of the diamond is mirrored. So the top layer (row1) has3,8, and the output adds a3 on the right. The bottom layer (row5) adds3s on both sides. \n\nBut why the3s? The original top layer has3 and8. The middle row3 has8 and3. Maybe the3s are part of a different layer. \n\nAnother thought: maybe the numbers represent a certain geometric shape, and the output is completing the shape by reflecting parts of it. For example, the input may have a part of a star or diamond, and the output completes it by adding missing mirrored parts.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each non-zero element is part of a horizontal line of numbers. For example, in Example0's input, the3 in row1, column2 is part of a horizontal line that should extend to column6. So the output adds that. Similarly, the8 in row1, column4 is the center and remains. \n\nThis seems plausible. So the pattern is that for each non-zero element in a row, extend a horizontal line from it to the mirrored position. For example, if a row has a number at columnc, add a copy of that number at the mirrored column (9 -c) if it's zero. \n\nBut in Example0's row1, the3 at column2 would mirror to column7 (9-2=7), but the output has it at column6. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the mirrored column is determined by the center column. For example, the center is between4 and5. So the distance from the center to column2 is2.5, so mirrored position is4.5 +2.5=7. But output has it at6. \n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the pattern isn't about mirroring, but about duplicating elements in a certain way. For example, in Example0's input, the3 in row1, column2 is duplicated in column6. So the distance from column2 to column6 is4. That's the same as column6 to column2. Maybe this is part of a larger pattern where elements are duplicated with a certain offset. \n\nAlternatively, consider that the output is created by adding the same number to the same row but shifted by four columns. For example, column2 +4=6. So 3 at column2 is added to column6. This fits Example0 and Example1. In Example0's row1:3 at2 \u21926. Example1's row2:2 at2 \u21926. Example2's row2:4 at4 \u21928 (4+4=8), but the output has4 at6. So this doesn't fit. So this theory only works for some cases. \n\nBut in Example2's row2, the input has4 at column4. Adding4 columns would take it to8, but output has it at6. So this theory is invalid. \n\nHmm. Let's try to find another common pattern. \n\nLooking at all three examples, the output seems to add certain numbers in the same row as the input, but on the opposite side. For example, each non-zero element in the input's row is mirrored in the output's row. The exact position varies, but it's consistently on the right side. \n\nFor Example0's row1:3 at2 \u21923 at6.\n\nExample1's row2:2 at2 \u21922 at6.\n\nExample2's row2:4 at4 \u21924 at6.\n\nSo, in each case, the mirrored position is column6. \n\nWhat's special about column6? It's the 7th position (0-based index6). For a 10-column grid, indices0-9. Column6 is three positions to the right of the center (between4 and5). So why are the mirrored elements being placed at column6?\n\nWait, maybe the mirrored position is calculated as follows: For each non-zero element in the left half (columns0-4), the mirrored position is column (4 + (4 -c)). For example, in Example0's row1, column2: 4 + (4-2)=6. So mirrored at6. That fits. For Example1's row2, column2: 4+ (4-2)=6. For Example2's row2, column4:4+(4-4)=4. So mirrored at4, but output has it at6. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the formula could be 8 -c. For column2:8-2=6. For column4:8-4=4. But in Example2's output, the4 is at6. So this doesn't fit. \n\nBut wait in Example2's input row2, the4 is at column4. If mirrored to8-4=4, but output has it at6. So this doesn't fit. So this formula works for some cases but not others. \n\nAnother possibility: For each non-zero element in the input, the output adds a copy of the element at column (9 -c -1). For example, column2 \u21929-2-1=6. This fits Example0 and1. For Example2's column4:9-4-1=4, but output has6. Doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the mirrored column is (c + 4) mod10. For column2:6. Column4:8. But Example2's output is6. So no. \n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to find a pattern based on the examples.\n\nIn Example0's input, the added elements are3 at column6 in row1 and3s at columns2 and6 in row5.\n\nIn Example1's input, added elements are2 at column6 in row2 and6.\n\nIn Example2's input, added elements are4 at column6 in row2 and4 at column6 in row4.\n\nSo, the common pattern is that in each case, a new element is added at column6. But why?\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input has elements in row2:1 at column1 and5,4 at column3. Row3:2 at columns2 and4. Row4:1 at column3. Row5:2 at columns2 and4. Row6:1 at columns1 and5.\n\nIf the pattern is to mirror certain elements to column6, then for example, in row2, the1 at column1 would mirror to column8 (9-1=8), but the output might add1 at column8. But I need to apply the pattern from the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to add, in each row, the elements from the left side mirrored to the right side, but only if they are non-zero in the input. For example, for each non-zero element in the left half of the row, add a copy in the right half at column (9 -c). But in the examples, this isn't exactly followed. However, perhaps the mirroring is done only for certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to take the non-zero elements in each row and create a symmetrical pattern by adding elements to the right side, but only if those positions are zero. For example, for each non-zero element in the left half of the row, add a copy to the right half such that the row becomes symmetric. \n\nFor example, in Example0's row1, the left has3 at2, so add3 at6 (mirror). The middle 8 remains. This makes the row symmetric. Similarly, Example1's row2 adds a2 at6 to mirror the2 at2. Example2's row2 adds4 at6 to mirror the4 at4. Wait, but4 is at the center. So mirroring it would require a copy at5. But the output has4 at6. So this doesn't fit. \n\nIn Example2's input row2: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0], output becomes [0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0]. So the4 is added at6. But why not at5?\n\nThis suggests that the mirroring is not around the center. Maybe the pattern is to mirror elements around column5. For example, for each non-zero element at columnc, add a copy at column (10 -c -1) =9 -c. So for column4, mirror is5. But in Example2's row2, the4 is at4, mirrored to5, but the output has4 at6. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirroring is done with a shift. For example, columnc's mirror is columnc +2. So for column2\u21924, but this doesn't fit the examples. \n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think of the test input and what the output would be based on the examples' patterns.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nIn the training examples, the output adds mirrored elements in certain rows. For example, in Example0 and1, the top and bottom rows of the diamond had elements added. For the test input, the diamond is centered around row4. The input rows with non-zero elements are rows2,3,4,5,6. So the top row is2 and bottom row6.\n\nIf the pattern is to mirror the elements in these top and bottom rows, then for row2, which has1s at columns1 and5, and4 at3. The output would add mirrored elements. For example, the1 at column1 would mirror to column8 (9-1=8), and the1 at5 would mirror to4 (9-5=4), but not sure. Or based on previous examples, maybe the elements are mirrored to column6. For example, the1 at column1 would be mirrored to column7 (9-1=8?), but in Example0's row1,3 at2 was mirrored to6.\n\nAlternatively, following the pattern from the examples, the elements in the top and bottom rows are mirrored to column6. So for row2's 1s at1 and5, perhaps add1 at column9-1=8 and9-5=4. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, in the test input's row2, the elements are at columns1,3,5. Following Example0's pattern, maybe add copies of these elements in the same row but on the opposite side. For example, the1 at column1 would be mirrored to column8 (9-1=8), the4 at3 to column6 (9-3=6), and the1 at5 to column4 (9-5=4). So row2's output would have elements at1,3,5,4,6,8. But I need to check what the examples do.\n\nBut in Example0's row1, the input has3 at2 and8 at4. The output adds3 at6. So mirroring3 from2 to6, but leaving the8 at4. So perhaps only elements in the left half (columns0-4) are mirrored to the right half (columns5-9) at column (9 -c). So column2\u21927, but in Example0's output it's at6. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe the pattern is to mirror elements from the left half to the right half, but shifted one column to the left. So column2\u21927-1=6. Column3\u21927. But this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the mirroring is done by subtracting the column index from 8. For example, column2\u21928-2=6. Column3\u21925. Column4\u21924. Column1\u21927. This would fit Example0's case: column2\u21926. Example1's column2\u21926. Example2's column4\u21924, but output has it at6. So this doesn't fit. \n\nThis is really tricky. Let's look for another approach. Maybe the output is generated by applying a kernel or convolution. For example, each cell in the output is the sum of its neighbors in the input. But looking at Example0's row1, column6 becomes3. The input row1 has3 at column2. Not sure how that would sum to3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero element is part of a diagonal, and the output adds elements along those diagonals. For example, in Example0's input, the3 at row1, column2 could have a diagonal going down-right to row5, column6. But in the output, row5 has3 at columns2 and6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by rotating the input 180 degrees. But in Example0's input, this would move row1 to row8, but output is in row1. So not matching.\n\nAfter trying multiple approaches and not finding a clear pattern, I think the pattern might be that each non-zero element in the input's left half of a row (columns0-4) is mirrored to the right half (columns5-9) at position (8 -c), which is 8 - original column. \n\nFor example:\n\n- In Example0's row1, column2\u21928-2=6. So add3 at6.\n- In Example1's row2, column2\u21926. Add2 at6.\n- In Example2's row2, column4\u21928-4=4. But the output has4 at6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but Example2's row2 in the input has4 at column4. According to this rule, it would mirror to4 (8-4=4), so no change. But the output has4 at6. So this theory is invalid. \n\nBut in Example2's output, row2 has4 at4 and6. So maybe the mirroring is done for all non-zero elements, regardless of their position. For example, column4's mirror is4.5 + (4.5 -4) =5. So mirrored to5. But the output has4 at6. \n\nThis is really confusing. I might need to give up and make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input's row2: [0,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0]. The non-zero elements are at1,3,5. Following Example0's pattern, perhaps each of these elements is mirrored to their respective mirrored positions. For example:\n\n- 1 at1 \u21928-1=7. So add1 at7.\n-4 at3 \u21928-3=5. So add4 at5.\n-1 at5 \u21928-5=3. So add1 at3.\n\nBut the input already has4 at3 and1 at5. So maybe the output would have:\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,4,0,1,4,1,0,0]\n\nBut how does this align with the training examples? In Example0's output, the mirrored elements are added to the same row. For instance, the3 is added at6. Similarly, in Example1's output, the2 is added at6. \n\nAlternatively, for each element in the left half (columns0-4), mirror to 9-c. So:\n\n-1 at1 \u21929-1=8 \u2192 add1 at8.\n-4 at3 \u21929-3=6 \u2192 add4 at6.\n-1 at5 is in the right half, so no mirroring.\n\nThus, row2's output would have elements at1,3,5,6,8. So row2 becomes: [0,1,0,4,0,1,4,0,1,0]. But I need to check if this fits the training examples.\n\nIn Example0's row1: input has3 at2 and8 at4. Mirroring3 to7 (9-2=7), but output has3 at6. Doesn't fit. So this theory is incorrect. \n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent without finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples provided. \n\nIn the test input, the structure seems to be a diamond with rows2,3,4,5,6. The output will likely add mirrored elements in the same rows. For example, row2 has1s at1 and5, and4 at3. The output might mirror these to the right. If the pattern is to mirror left elements to the right of the center, then:\n\n-1 at1 would mirror to column8 (9-1=8).\n-4 at3 would mirror to column6 (9-3=6).\n-1 at5 is already in the right half, so no mirroring.\n\nSo row2's output would have1 at1,4 at3,1 at5,4 at6,1 at8. \n\nSimilarly, row6 would have1s mirrored. Row3 and5 would have their elements mirrored as well.\n\nBut based on the training examples, the middle rows (like row3 in Example0) don't have elements added. So maybe the output mirrors only the top and bottom rows of the diamond.\n\nSo for the test input, the top row is row2 and bottom row6. Their elements would be mirrored. \n\nRow2 in test input: [0,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0]. Output would add1 at8 (mirror of1 at1),4 at6 (mirror of3), and possibly 1 at3 (mirror of5). But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, following Example0's pattern where the added elements are at column6 for left elements, the test input's row2 would have4 added at6 and1 added at6. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nAnother idea: The output completes each row to be symmetric. For example, each row in the output is symmetric around the center. So for each element in the left half, a copy is added in the right half. For example, test input row2 has1 at1,4 at3,1 at5. To make it symmetric, the output would need to add1 at9-1=8,4 at9-3=6, and1 at9-5=4. But the row already has1 at5. So the output would be [0,1,0,4,0,1,4,0,1,0]. \n\nSimilarly, row6 would become [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 mirrored to [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] (no change? Because already symmetric). But according to the training examples, the output adds elements even if the input row isn't symmetric. \n\nFor example, Example0's input row1 is not symmetric, but the output makes it symmetric. So the pattern is to make each row symmetric by mirroring the left elements to the right. \n\nIf this is the case, then for each non-zero element in the left half (columns0-4), add a copy in the right half (columns5-9) at column9 -c. For elements in the right half, leave them as is. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow2: input elements at1,3,5. Mirroring1\u21928,3\u21926. So output row2 would have elements at1,3,5,6,8.\n\nRow3: input elements at2 and4. Mirroring2\u21927,4\u21925. But output row3 would have elements at2,4,5,7.\n\nRow5: same as row3.\n\nRow6: input elements at1 and5. Mirroring1\u21928. So output row6 would have1,5,8.\n\nRow4: input element at3. Mirroring3\u21926. So output row4 would have3 and6.\n\nBut this would change the structure significantly. Let's see how this fits with the training examples.\n\nExample0's row1 input:3 at2,8 at4. Mirroring3\u21927,8\u21925. So output would have3 at2,7,8 at4,5. But in the output, it's3,8,3. So this doesn't fit. So this theory is incorrect. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the examples. The output likely mirrors certain elements in the same row, adding them to the right side. For the test input, the rows that are part of the diamond (rows2,3,4,5,6) will have their left elements mirrored to the right.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 mirror 1 at1 to8, 4 at3 to6. So output row2: [0,1,0,4,0,1,4,0,1,0].\n\nRow3: [0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 mirror 2 at2 to7. So output row3: [0,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,0,0].\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 mirror1 at3 to6. Output row4: [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0].\n\nRow5: [0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 mirror2 at2 to7. Output same as row3.\n\nRow6: [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 mirror1 at1 to8,1 at5 to4. So output row6: [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0].\n\nBut how does this align with the training examples? For example, in Example0's row1, the input has3 at2 and8 at4. Mirroring3 to7 and8 to5. But the output has3 at6 and3 at2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the mirroring is done around column5. So for columnc, mirror is 9 -c. For column2, mirror is7. But in Example0's output, the3 is at6. So this doesn't fit. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to generate the output based on the assumption that each row is made symmetric by mirroring left elements to the right. Even though this doesn't perfectly fit all examples, it's the closest pattern I can identify.",
