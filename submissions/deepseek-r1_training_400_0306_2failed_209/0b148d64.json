        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each example has a list of input arrays and an output array. The task is to transform the input into the output somehow.\n\nFirst, let's look at Example 0. The input has multiple arrays, and the output seems to be a subset of them. Wait, the output in Example 0 is the last 10 arrays starting from index 11. Wait, the input has 21 arrays (indices 0-20), and the output is 10 arrays. Wait, the input lists for Example 0 have 21 elements each, but the output has 10 elements. Wait, no, looking at the INPUT part of Example 0: there are multiple arrays listed. For example, the first INPUT line is [8,8,8,...], then the next line is another array, etc. So the INPUT is a list of multiple arrays (rows?), and the OUTPUT is another list of arrays. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 0's INPUT, there are 21 arrays (each line is an array). The OUTPUT has 10 arrays. Looking at the OUTPUT arrays in Example 0, they correspond to the arrays from index 11 to 20 in the INPUT. Wait, let's check:\n\nThe first OUTPUT array in Example 0 is [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2], which matches the 12th INPUT array (index 11, since starting from 0) of Example 0: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8]. Wait, but the OUTPUT array is shorter. The input array here is length 21, but the output is length 10. So maybe they take the first 10 elements of each array starting from index 11?\n\nLooking closer, the first OUTPUT array in Example 0 is [0,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,2], which is the first 10 elements of the 12th input array (index 11) in the INPUT list. Similarly, the next OUTPUT array [2,0,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2] matches the first 10 elements of the 13th input array (index 12) in the INPUT list. And this pattern continues. So the OUTPUT is taking the arrays from index 11 to 20 (inclusive) of the INPUT, and truncating each to the first 10 elements.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\nIn Example 0's INPUT, the first OUTPUT array is [0,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,2], which is exactly the first 10 elements of the INPUT array at index 11 (since the input arrays are listed starting from 0). The original input array at index 11 is [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8]. So taking the first 10 elements gives the first output array. Similarly, the next input array (index 12) is [2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0], and taking the first 10 elements gives the second output array.\n\nSo the pattern here is: from the input list of arrays, select the arrays starting from index 11 (i.e., the 12th array) up to index 20 (the 21st array), and for each of those arrays, take the first 10 elements. That gives the output list of arrays.\n\nChecking Example 1 to confirm. The INPUT for Example 1 has 19 arrays (indices 0-18). The OUTPUT has 7 arrays. Let's see:\n\nThe first OUTPUT array is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3], which is the first 9 elements of the 12th input array (index 11). Let's check the input array at index 11 in Example 1's input: [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3]. Taking the first 9 elements would be [2,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0], but the output is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3]. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the indices.\n\nWait, maybe the selection starts after a certain number of rows. Alternatively, perhaps the output is taking the rows where the value in a certain position changes. Alternatively, maybe the output is the set of rows that have a new number (like 2,3, etc.), but that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the OUTPUT is the set of arrays that come after the first consecutive block of all-zero arrays. Let's check Example 0. In Example 0's INPUT, the 9th, 10th, and 11th (indices 9, 10, 11) are all zeros. Wait, looking at the INPUT arrays for Example 0:\n\nLooking at the INPUT lists:\n\nAfter the first 10 arrays (index 0-9), there's index 10 and 11 as all zeros. Wait, in Example 0's input, the 9th array (index 9) is all zeros. Then index 10 is all zeros. Then index 11 starts with 0,2,2,2... So maybe the OUTPUT is the arrays after the consecutive all-zero arrays. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, there are two all-zero arrays (indices 9 and 10). Then starting from index 11, the arrays have non-zero elements. The output is from index 11 to 20, but why 10 arrays? Wait, the output has 10 arrays. Let's count: from index 11 to 20 is 10 arrays (since 20-11+1=10). So perhaps the pattern is to take all arrays after the last all-zero array. In Example 0, the first all-zero arrays are at indices 9 and 10, but perhaps there's a longer block. Wait, looking at the input arrays:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nIndices 9: [0,0,...0]\nIndex 10: [0,0,...0]\nSo two all-zero arrays. Then starting from index 11, the arrays have non-zero elements. The output takes from index 11 to 20, taking the first 10 elements of each. So maybe the rule is: after the last all-zero array in the input list, take the next arrays, up to a certain count, and truncate each to the first 10 elements.\n\nBut in Example 0, there are 21 input arrays, and the output is 10 arrays starting from index 11. So how many all-zero arrays are there before that? Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nIndex 9: all zeros (length 21, but all elements are 0)\nIndex 10: same.\n\nSo indices 9 and 10 are all-zero. Then index 11 is the first non-zero array after that. So the output starts at index 11 and takes the next 10 arrays. But why 10? Because the output has 10 arrays. But in Example 1, the output has 7 arrays. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1's input, how many all-zero arrays are there? Looking at the input:\n\nIndices 6-10 are all-zero arrays (each line is all zeros). Then starting at index 11, the arrays have non-zero elements. The output in Example 1 has 7 arrays. Let's count from index 11 to 17 (since 17-11+1=7 arrays). So the output arrays are indices 11 to 17, each truncated to the first 9 elements (since the output arrays in Example 1 are length 9). Wait, but the first output array in Example 1 is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3], which is 9 elements. Let's check the input array at index 11 in Example 1: [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3]. The first 9 elements are [2,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0], but the output is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3]. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. Wait, maybe the input is a list of multiple arrays, and the output is the part of each array after the first consecutive zeros? Or maybe after a certain position in each array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking all arrays that contain a certain value (like 2 in Example 0, 3 in Example 1, 4 in Example 2) and truncating them. But in Example 0, the output arrays are the ones starting with 0,2, etc., which are part of the input arrays that contain 2 and 8. But the output arrays in Example 0's output are the ones that have 2s in their elements.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is: in the input list of arrays, find the first occurrence of a new number (like 2 in Example 0, 3 in Example 1, 4 in Example 2), then take those arrays starting from that point and truncate each to the first N elements, where N is the number of elements before the first occurrence of a block of four zeros. For example, in Example 0, each array has a block of four zeros starting at position 10 (if we index from 0). Let me check:\n\nIn Example 0's input array at index 11: [0,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,8,8,0,8]. The positions 10-13 are zeros (indices 10,11,12,13). So the first four consecutive zeros are starting at index 10. So the first part of the array is up to index 9 (elements 0-9), which is 10 elements. Then the output takes those 10 elements. So the pattern could be: for each array in the input list, find the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros, take all elements before that and truncate the array there. Then, collect the arrays that have such a truncation (i.e., those after the initial all-zero arrays in the input list).\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the output arrays are taken from the input arrays starting at index 11, and each is truncated to the first 10 elements. Let's check if those 10 elements are the part before the four zeros. For the array at index 11 in Example 0's input: elements 0-9 are [0,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,2], then elements 10-13 are zeros. So yes, truncating at the four zeros gives the first 10 elements. Similarly, the array at index 12: [2,0,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2, ...], elements 0-9 are the first 10, then elements 10-13 are zeros. So each of these arrays in the input has four consecutive zeros starting at index 10. So the output for each array is the elements before the four consecutive zeros, i.e., the first 10 elements.\n\nSo the overall pattern seems to be:\n\n1. From the input list of arrays, identify the arrays that come after the last all-zero array in the input list. These are the arrays that start the non-zero parts.\n\n2. For each of these arrays, truncate them to the elements before the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros. In the training examples, the four consecutive zeros start at position 10 (0-based index 10), so the first 10 elements are taken.\n\nIn Example 0, the input arrays after the all-zero arrays (indices 9 and 10) are indices 11 to 20. Each of these arrays has four consecutive zeros starting at index 10, so the output is the first 10 elements of each.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has all-zero arrays at indices 6-10. Then starting at index 11, the arrays are non-zero. Each of these arrays has four consecutive zeros starting at index 10 (since looking at the first test input array in Example 1's input: [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3]. The four zeros start at index 7 (elements 7-10: 0,0,0,0). Wait, but this array's elements 7-10 are 0,0,0,0. So the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros starts at index 7, so the truncation would be up to index 6. But the output array in Example 1's first output is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3], which is 9 elements. That doesn't align with this. Hmm, maybe my previous assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the four zeros are in the middle of the array, but in the training examples, the four consecutive zeros are always at the same position. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 1's output arrays:\n\nFirst output array: [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3] (length 9). The input array at index 11 in Example 1 is [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3]. If we look for four consecutive zeros, they start at index 7 (elements 7-10: 0,0,0,0). So the part before that is elements 0-6, which is 7 elements. But the output is length 9. This contradicts the earlier theory.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the previous approach might not be correct. Let me re-examine the examples.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's output, each output array is 10 elements long. The input arrays in Example 0 are 21 elements each. The output arrays are the first 10 elements. The four consecutive zeros start at index 10. So 10 elements before that. So for each input array in Example 0's selected set (indices 11-20), the first 10 elements are taken, which is before the four zeros starting at index 10.\n\nIn Example 1's input arrays after the all-zero arrays (indices 11-18) have varying lengths, but each output array's length is 9. Let's check the input array at index 11 in Example 1: length 19. The output array is 9 elements. Looking at that input array: [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3]. The four consecutive zeros are elements 7-10 (indices 7 to 10), which is four zeros. The elements before that would be indices 0-6 (7 elements). But the output is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3], which is 9 elements. That doesn't match. So maybe the pattern isn't about four consecutive zeros. Or perhaps there's a different trigger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements after a certain position in the input arrays. For Example 0, the output arrays are the first 10 elements. Example 1's output arrays are the first 9 elements. Example 2's output arrays are the first 6 elements. So maybe the length of the output arrays depends on the position of a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's input arrays. The output arrays are 6 elements each. Let's check one input array from Example 2: the first output array is [4,0,0,4,0,4], which comes from the input array at index 10: [4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Taking the first 6 elements gives [4,0,0,4,0,4], which matches the output. So the output is the first 6 elements of the input arrays starting from index 10 (the 11th array) in Example 2.\n\nBut why different lengths in each example? The output array lengths are 10, 9, 6 for Examples 0,1,2. So perhaps the length is determined by the position where a new number appears. In Example 0, the new number is 2, which first appears in the input arrays after the all-zero arrays. The first 10 elements of these arrays are taken. In Example 1, the new number is 3, and the first 9 elements are taken. Example 2 has 4 as the new number, first 6 elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output arrays are the elements before the first occurrence of the number that's in the all-zero arrays. For example, in Example 0, after the all-zero arrays, the input arrays have 2 and 8. The output arrays are the elements before the 8s. Let's check: in the first output array of Example 0, the elements after the first 10 are 0,0,0,0,8,8, etc. So the 8s start at index 14 (element 14). So maybe the output is the elements before the first occurrence of a number different from the new one. Wait, but how would that explain the varying lengths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays are the parts of the input arrays after the all-zero rows and before the first occurrence of a certain number. For example, in Example 0, after the all-zero rows, the input arrays have 2 and 8. So perhaps the output arrays are taken up to the first occurrence of 8, and then truncated. But in the first output array of Example 0, there are no 8s in the first 10 elements. The 8s start at element 14. So perhaps the output is all elements up to the first occurrence of a non-2 number (assuming the new number is 2). But that doesn't fit because some elements are 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are part of the new number's sequence. Like, in Example 0, the new number is 2. So any elements that are 2 or 0, perhaps. But not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of the overall pattern. Each example's output consists of the input arrays that come after the last all-zero array, and each output array is truncated to the first N elements, where N is determined by the first occurrence of a block of four zeros. But in Example 0, the four zeros start at index 10, so N=10. In Example 1, the four zeros start at index 10 as well. Let's check Example 1's input array at index 11: [2,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3]. The four zeros are indices 7-10. So N would be 7 elements, but the output array is 9 elements. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays are all elements up to the first occurrence of a certain value. For example, in Example 0's output arrays, the elements are 0 and 2. So perhaps the output arrays are the elements until a number other than 0 or 2 appears. Looking at the input array at index 11 in Example 0: the elements after the first 10 include 0,0,0,0,8,8, etc. So the first occurrence of 8 is at index 14. But the output is taken up to index 9 (first 10 elements), so that's before the 8s. So maybe the output is the elements before any occurrence of a number different from the new number (2) and 0. But this would vary per example.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are the first part of each array after the all-zero arrays, and the truncation is to the first occurrence of a new block of four zeros. But how does that fit with varying lengths?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input, perhaps the same pattern applies. Let's look at the Test Input:\n\nThe Test Input has multiple arrays. The first few arrays have elements like 1, 0, etc. Then there are several all-zero arrays (indices 6-9). Then starting from index 10, the arrays have elements with 3s. So the output should be the arrays after the all-zero arrays (indices 10-14), and each truncated to the first N elements, where N is determined by the position of four consecutive zeros. \n\nLooking at the first array in the Test Input after the all-zero arrays (index 10): [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]. Let's check for four consecutive zeros. The elements are 3,0,0,0,0,3,... So indices 1-4 are four zeros. So the first occurrence of four zeros starts at index 1. The elements before that would be index 0 (3), but that's only one element. But the output would need to take up to the first N elements before four consecutive zeros. But this would give varying lengths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the first 10 elements of each array after the all-zero arrays. But in the Test Input, each array after the all-zero arrays (indices 10-14) are of length 17. Taking the first 10 elements would give 10 elements per array. But in Example 1's outputs, the arrays are 9 elements long, which would not fit this. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output array length is determined by the position of the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros. For each array after the all-zero arrays, find the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros and truncate up to that point. The output is all such truncated arrays.\n\nIn Example 0's input arrays after the all-zero arrays, the four zeros start at index 10, so truncating to 10 elements. In Example 1's input arrays after the all-zero arrays, the four zeros start at varying positions. For example, the first output array in Example 1 is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3], which comes from the input array [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3]. In this input array, four consecutive zeros start at index 7 (elements 7-10: 0,0,0,0). So the elements before that are indices 0-6 (7 elements), but the output is 9 elements. That doesn't align.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to find a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: In the Training Examples, the outputs are arrays that consist of the new number (2,3,4 in Examples 0,1,2) and 0. The other numbers (like 8 in Example 0) are not present in the output. So perhaps the output arrays are the parts of the input arrays after the all-zero arrays, but with all numbers except the new one and 0 replaced with 0. But looking at Example 0's output, the arrays have 0 and 2. The original input arrays after the all-zero arrays have 2 and 8, but the output arrays include 0 and 2. So maybe they're keeping 0 and the new number (2), and replacing other numbers (like 8) with 0. But in Example 0's output, there's no 8 present in the output arrays because they're truncated before the 8s appear.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's output, the arrays are the first 10 elements of the input arrays after the all-zero arrays. The 8s in the input arrays start at index 14, which is beyond the first 10 elements. So the output arrays don't include the 8s. So perhaps the pattern is simply to take the arrays after the last all-zero array in the input list and truncate each to the first N elements, where N is the position before the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros.\n\nIn Example 0, four consecutive zeros start at index 10 in each of the input arrays after the all-zero arrays, so truncate to 10 elements.\n\nIn Example 1, looking at the input arrays after the all-zero arrays, let's check where four consecutive zeros start. Take the first output array's input array (index 11): [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3]. The four consecutive zeros start at index 7 (elements 7-10: 0,0,0,0). So truncate to index 6, which is 7 elements. But the output array is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3], which is 9 elements. That doesn't match.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nIn each example, the output arrays are the ones that follow the block of all-zero arrays. The output arrays are all the input arrays that come after the last all-zero array, and each of these arrays is truncated to the first part before a certain pattern. The length of the truncation varies per example.\n\nExample 0's output arrays are 10 elements long. The input arrays after the all-zero arrays have 21 elements each, but the output is 10 elements. The number 10 might be the position where the four consecutive zeros start. For Example 0, four consecutive zeros start at index 10 (0-based), so the first 10 elements are before that. Hence, taking first 10 elements.\n\nExample 1's output arrays are 9 elements long. Let's check the input arrays after the all-zero arrays. For the first output array in Example 1 (input index 11): [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3]. The four consecutive zeros start at index 7 (elements 7-10: 0,0,0,0). So the first 7 elements are before that. But the output array is 9 elements, which suggests this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the truncation is to the first occurrence of the new number. In Example 0, the new number is 2. The output arrays start with 0 or 2 and have no other numbers. The input arrays after the all-zero arrays have 2 and 8. So maybe the truncation is up to the last occurrence of 2 before another number appears. But in Example 0's output arrays, all elements are 0 and 2, so the truncation is before 8 appears, which is at index 14, so taking first 10 elements.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe the output is the first part of each array after the all-zero arrays, up to a certain length determined by the example. For instance, in Example 0, the output arrays are 10 elements, Example 1 9 elements, Example 2 6 elements.\n\nBut why those lengths? It seems like the length is determined by the position where a new number appears. For Example 2, the new number is 4. The output arrays are 6 elements long, which is the position where 4 stops and another number (1) starts. For example, the first output array in Example 2 is [4,0,0,4,0,4], which is the first 6 elements of the input array [4,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,1,0,...]. The 1 appears at index 8. So the truncation is up to the first occurrence of a different number (1). But then why 6 elements? Because after index 5, there's a 4, then index 6 is 0. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the length of the output arrays in each example is determined by the number of elements before the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros. In Example 0, the four zeros start at index 10, so 10 elements. In Example 1, the first four zeros in the input array after the all-zero arrays (index 11) are at indices 7-10, so the first 7 elements. But the output array is 9 elements long. This doesn't align.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In all training examples, the output arrays are those input arrays that follow the last occurrence of a all-zero array. For example, in Example 0, after indices 9 and 10 (all zeros), the arrays from 11 onwards are included in the output. In Example 1, after indices 6-10 (all zeros), the arrays from 11 onwards are included. In Example 2, after the all-zero arrays (indices 7-9), the arrays from 10 onwards are included.\n\nOnce those arrays are selected, each is truncated to a certain length. The length seems to be determined by the position of the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros. For Example 0, the four zeros start at index 10, so 10 elements. For Example 1, maybe the four zeros start earlier. Let's check the first output array of Example 1:\n\nInput array (index 11): [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3]. The four consecutive zeros are at indices 7-10. So the first occurrence is at index 7. Therefore, the truncation would be up to index 6 (7 elements). But the output array is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3] which is 9 elements. This doesn't fit. So this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays are the elements after a certain pattern. For example, in the input arrays after the all-zero arrays, look for a block of four zeros and take the elements before that. If the four zeros are at index x, then take up to x-1. But in Example 0, this works. In Example 1, for the first array, the four zeros start at index 7, so take up to 6. But the output is longer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the four zeros are not in the same array. Or perhaps the four zeros are part of a larger pattern.\n\nAnother angle: the test input. Let's look at the Test Input. There are 15 arrays. The first 6 arrays (indices 0-5) have 1s and 0s, then indices 6-9 are all zeros, then indices 10-14 have 3s. The output should be the arrays after the all-zero ones (indices 10-14), each truncated to the first N elements. What is N?\n\nIn Example 0, N is 10. Example 1, N is 9. Example 2, N is 6. Maybe the N is determined by the position where the new number (3 in the test case) first appears. Or the position where four consecutive zeros start.\n\nLooking at the Test Input's array at index 10: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]. Four consecutive zeros are indices 1-4. So truncate to index 0, which is [3], but the output would need to have longer arrays. This doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays in the test case would be the first 10 elements of each array after the all-zero arrays. But each array in the test input's indices 10-14 has length 17. Taking the first 10 elements of each:\n\nIndex 10: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3]\nIndex 11: [0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]\nIndex 12: [3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0]\nIndex 13: [3,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,3]\nIndex 14: [0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut in the training examples, the output arrays are shorter. For example, in Example 1, the output arrays are 9 elements. But this approach would give varying lengths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output arrays are the first occurrence of the new number's section. For example, in the test case, the new number is 3. The output would be the arrays starting from the first array with 3, which is index 10, and for each of those arrays, take up to the first occurrence of a number that's not 3 or 0. \n\nLooking at the array at index 10 in the test input: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]. The elements are all 3 or 0. So take the entire array. But the output arrays in the training examples are shorter. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first occurrence of the new number's section, and each array is truncated to the first N elements where N is the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros. For the test case, the array at index 10 has four consecutive zeros at indices 1-4, so truncate to index 0. But that would be [3]. That doesn't fit.\n\nI'm running out of ideas. Let's try to hypothesize based on the examples:\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n\n1. Find the last block of all-zero arrays in the input list. The output arrays are the ones that come after this block.\n\n2. For each of these arrays, truncate them to the elements before the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros. The length of each output array is determined by where these four consecutive zeros start.\n\nIn Example 0, each of these arrays has four consecutive zeros starting at index 10, so take the first 10 elements.\n\nIn Example 1, the four consecutive zeros start at varying positions. For example, in the first output array (input index 11), four consecutive zeros start at index 7, so take the first 7 elements. But the output array is 9 elements long. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the four consecutive zeros are always in the same position for each example, such as starting at index 10. In Example 0, the input arrays are 21 elements long, so four zeros start at index 10. Example 1's input arrays are 19 elements long; maybe four zeros start at index 10, which would be elements 10-13. But looking at the input array at index 11 in Example 1: elements 10-13 are 0,3,3,3. Not zeros. So that's not the case.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that the output is the arrays after the last all-zero array in the input list, each truncated to the first 10 elements (for Example 0), first 9 (Example 1), first 6 (Example 2). But this varies per example. Perhaps the truncation is to the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros. For the test case, each array after the all-zero arrays would be truncated to the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros.\n\nLooking at the test input's array at index 10: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]. Four consecutive zeros start at index 1 (elements 1-4: 0,0,0,0). So the truncation would be to index 0, resulting in [3]. But that's not plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output arrays are those after the last all-zero array, and for each, take the elements before the first occurrence of a certain value (like the number 8 in Example 0, 3 in Example 1, 4 in Example 2). But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are the parts of the input arrays after the all-zero arrays but before the original numbers reappear. For example, in Example 0, the original numbers were 8, then after all-zero arrays, the new numbers are 2. So take the parts of the arrays where 2 and 0 are present, and stop before 8 reappears. But in Example 0's output arrays, the 8s are in the input arrays but not in the output because they're truncated before that point.\n\nIn the test input, the original numbers are 1 and 3. The arrays after the all-zero arrays have 3 and 0. So perhaps the output is the arrays after the all-zero arrays, truncated to the first 10 elements. Let's check:\n\nThe test input's arrays after the all-zero arrays are indices 10-14. Each of these arrays is of length 17. Taking the first 10 elements of each:\n\nIndex 10: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3]\nIndex 11: [0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]\nIndex 12: [3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0]\nIndex 13: [3,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,3]\nIndex 14: [0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the output would be these five arrays. But looking at the examples, the output arrays vary in count. For instance, Example 0 has 10 output arrays, which corresponds to the 10 arrays after the all-zero arrays. In the test case, there are 5 arrays after the all-zero arrays (indices 10-14), so the output should have 5 arrays.\n\nBut according to the examples, Example 0 has 10 output arrays (input indices 11-20), Example 1 has 7 (input indices 11-17), and Example 2 has 9 (input indices 10-18).\n\nSo the output is all arrays after the last all-zero array in the input list, regardless of count. Then, each is truncated to the first N elements, where N is determined by the position of four consecutive zeros in each array.\n\nIn the test case, let's check each array after the all-zero arrays:\n\nIndex 10: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]. Four consecutive zeros start at index 1 (elements 1-4: 0,0,0,0). So truncate to index 0, length 1. But this doesn't match any of the examples.\n\nAlternatively, if four consecutive zeros start at index 10, but in this array, they start earlier. So perhaps the pattern is not consistent. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the initial pattern observed in Example 0: take the arrays after the last all-zero array and truncate each to the first 10 elements. For the test input, the last all-zero arrays are indices 6-9. The arrays after that are indices 10-14. Each of these arrays has 17 elements. Taking the first 10 elements of each would give:\n\nFor index 10: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3]\nIndex 11: [0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]\nIndex 12: [3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0]\nIndex 13: [3,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,3]\nIndex 14: [0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThese would be the output arrays. However, in Example 1, the output arrays have varying lengths. But given that the user's response format is to mimic the training examples, perhaps the correct approach is to take the arrays after the last all-zero array and truncate each to the first N elements, where N is the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros. But without knowing the exact N, perhaps the test input follows the same pattern as Example 0, where four consecutive zeros start at index 10, hence truncating to 10 elements.\n\nIn the test input's array at index 10, four consecutive zeros start at index 1. So taking the first 1 element would be [3], but this doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the four consecutive zeros are part of a larger block. For example, in the test input's array at index 10, there are four zeros starting at index 1, then after that, there are more elements. But according to the training examples, the output truncation is based on the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros, regardless of their position.\n\nThus, for the test input's arrays after the all-zero arrays:\n\nFor each array:\n\n- Find the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros.\n- Truncate the array up to the element before those four zeros start.\n- If there are no four consecutive zeros, include the entire array (but this doesn't happen in the training examples).\n\nLet's apply this to the test input:\n\nTest input arrays after all-zero (indices 10-14):\n\nIndex 10: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]\nFour zeros start at index 1. Truncate to elements 0: [3]\n\nIndex 11: [0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,3,3,0,0,0]\nLooking for four consecutive zeros. There are three zeros starting at index 6 (elements 6-8: 0,0,0). Only three zeros. No four consecutive. So include entire array up to first 10 elements: [0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]\n\nIndex 12: [3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]\nFour zeros start at index 5 (elements 5-8: 0,0,0,3). Not four zeros. So no four consecutive zeros. Take first 10 elements: [3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nIndex 13: [3,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3]\nFour zeros start at index 6 (elements 6-9: 0,0,0,0). Truncate to elements 0-5: [3,0,3,0,3,0]\n\nIndex 14: [0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,0]\nFour zeros start at index 3 (elements 3-6: 0,0,0,0). Truncate to elements 0-2: [0,3,3]\n\nBut this results in varying lengths, which doesn't match the training examples. For example, in Example 0, all output arrays are 10 elements. So this approach is likely incorrect.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the initial approach: take the arrays after the last all-zero array and truncate each to the first 10 elements. Applying this to the test input:\n\nThe test input has five arrays after the all-zero arrays (indices 10-14). Each is truncated to the first 10 elements:\n\nIndex 10: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3]\nIndex 11: [0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]\nIndex 12: [3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0]\nIndex 13: [3,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,3]\nIndex 14: [0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThese would be the output arrays. But according to the training examples, the number of output arrays varies. For example, Example 0 has 10 output arrays (input indices 11-20). The test input's output would have 5 arrays.\n\nBut the user's examples have varying numbers of output arrays, depending on how many arrays are after the all-zero arrays. So this is acceptable.\n\nBut looking at Example 2, the output has 9 arrays, which corresponds to input indices 10-18 (9 arrays), each truncated to 6 elements. So perhaps the truncation length is determined by the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros. For Example 2's input arrays after the all-zero arrays:\n\nTake array at index 10: [4,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]. Four consecutive zeros start at index 6 (elements 6-9: 0,0,1,0). Wait, that's not four zeros. Or maybe elements 6-9 are 0,0,1,0. Not four zeros. So perhaps the truncation length is different. But in Example 2, the output arrays are 6 elements long. Looking at the input array at index 10, the first 6 elements are [4,0,0,4,0,4], which matches the first output array. So perhaps for Example 2, the truncation is to 6 elements regardless of the four zeros. This suggests that the truncation length varies per example and is not determined by the four consecutive zeros.\n\nThis inconsistency makes it hard to find a pattern. Given that I'm time-constrained, I'll proceed with the pattern that the output arrays are the ones after the last all-zero array in the input list, each truncated to the first N elements, where N is the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros. For the test case, the output would be:\n\nFor each array after the all-zero block (indices 10-14):\n\nIndex 10: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3] (truncated to first 10 elements)\nIndex 11: [0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]\nIndex 12: [3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0]\nIndex 13: [3,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,3] (four zeros start at index 6, so first 6 elements: [3,0,3,0,3,0])\nIndex 14: [0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (four zeros start at index 3, so first 3 elements: [0,3,3])\n\nBut this would create arrays of varying lengths, which doesn't match the training examples where all output arrays have the same length. For example, Example 0's output arrays are all 10 elements. Example 1's are all 9 elements. Example 2's are all 6 elements. So perhaps the truncation length is uniform per example, determined by the position of four consecutive zeros in the first such array.\n\nIn Example 0, the first output array has four zeros starting at index 10, so all are truncated to 10 elements. Example 1, the first output array has four zeros starting at index 10, but in Example 1's input arrays after the all-zero arrays, perhaps the four zeros are at index 10. Let's check:\n\nExample 1's input array at index 11: [2,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3]. Four consecutive zeros start at index 7. So truncate to 7 elements, but the output array is 9 elements. This doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the answer that the output is the arrays after the last all-zero array, each truncated to the first 10 elements for the test case. This matches the first example's pattern, even if not the others. It's possible that the test case's output arrays are each 10 elements long, but looking at the input arrays, some may have fewer than 10 elements. However, the test input's arrays after the all-zero are length 17, so taking the first 10 elements is possible.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples given to understand what's going on.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the input consists of multiple arrays. The output arrays are shorter than the input. The first thing I notice is that in the input, there's a section of multiple zeros, like [0, 0, 0, 0] in each array. For instance, in the first input array of Example 0, there's a part [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, ...]. The output seems to be taking elements from before this block of zeros. But wait, let me check more carefully.\n\nWait, in the first input of Example 0, the array is [8,8,8,8,8,0,8,...], and the output starts with [0,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,2]. Hmm, maybe the output is not directly taken from the input. Let me compare the input and output rows.\n\nLooking at the input arrays in Example 0, each input array has a segment of four zeros followed by 8s and other numbers. For example, the first input array has [...,0,0,0,0,8,8,...]. The output arrays in Example 0 don't have 8s anymore. Instead, they have 0s and 2s. So perhaps the transformation involves taking a specific part of the input array, possibly after those four zeros.\n\nWait, let's check the first input array in Example 0:\nInput row: [8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8]\nLooking at the zeros, there's a single 0 at index 5, then later four zeros starting at index 10. The output for this example starts with [0,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,2]. How does this relate?\n\nWait, maybe the output is the part of the input array that comes after the four consecutive zeros. Let's check. The input array's four consecutive zeros start at index 10. After that, the elements are 8,8,8,8,0,8,8. But the output is [0,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,2]. That doesn't match. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived from a different part of the input. Let's check another example. In Example 1, the input arrays have sequences of zeros, and the outputs are parts of the input where the numbers change to 3s. For instance, in Example 1's input, after some zeros, there's a part with 3s, and the output seems to capture those 3s. Similarly, in Example 2, the output arrays are parts of the input that contain 4s.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input, the first few input rows have 8s, then in the later rows (starting from index 11), there are 2s. The output arrays in Example 0 are those rows that have 2s. For example, the 11th input array in Example 0 is [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8], and the output starts with [0,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,2]. So maybe the output is the first part of the input array, up to the four zeros. Wait, the input array has [0,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,2] followed by [0,0,0,0], then 8s. So the output takes the part before the four zeros. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example 0, the input arrays that contribute to the output are the ones where after a certain point, there's a sequence of four zeros. The output arrays are the elements before those four zeros. Let's confirm:\n\nTake the 11th input row in Example 0:\n[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8]\nThe output is [0,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,2], which is exactly the elements before the four consecutive zeros (indices 10-13 are 0s). So the pattern might be: in each input array, look for the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros, take the elements before that sequence, and that's the output array. But in the input arrays, the four zeros are part of a longer sequence? Or maybe four zeros in a row.\n\nWait, let's check the other examples. In Example 1, the test input rows have parts with four zeros. For example, the 11th input row in Example 1 is [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3]. The output here starts [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3]. Wait, but the four zeros here start at index 10. So before that would be [2,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0], but the output is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3], which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the four zeros are part of a longer sequence. Wait, in Example 1's input, the rows that contribute to the output are those that have 3s. For example, the first output row in Example 1 is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3], which comes from the input row [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3]. The output seems to start after the four zeros. Wait, the input row has four zeros starting at index 10, then comes 3s. The output is the part after the four zeros? But the output starts with 0, which is part of the four zeros. Wait, maybe the four zeros are part of a delimiter. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the four zeros are a separator, and the output is the part after those four zeros. But in Example 0, the output is before the four zeros. That would be conflicting. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the output is taken from the part before the four zeros. But in Example 1, let's check:\n\nTake the first output row of Example 1: [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3]. The input row is [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3]. Here, the four consecutive zeros start at index 10 (elements 10-13 are 0,3,3,3? Wait, no. Wait, the input row is [2,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3]. So indices 10-13 are 0,3,3,3, which is not four zeros. Wait, maybe the four zeros are at a different position. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the input row for Example 1's first output row:\n\nIndices: 0:2,1:0,2:2,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:2,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:3,... So from index 7 to 10, there are four zeros (indices 7,8,9,10: 0,0,0,0). Then, the part after is 3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3. But the output is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3]. The first element is 0, which is the zero at index 10. Wait, but the four zeros are indices 7-10 (0,0,0,0). Then the output starts from index 11 onwards. So maybe the output is the elements after the four zeros. But in Example 0, the outputs are elements before the four zeros. That contradicts.\n\nHmm, this approach might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input is a 2D grid, and the four zeros are a vertical block. For example, in the training examples, maybe the input is arranged as rows of a matrix, and the four zeros are in a column, and the output is the rows that are adjacent to that column. But this might be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 0's input and output, the output arrays have lengths 10, 10, etc., while the input arrays are longer. So maybe the output is the first 10 elements after some transformation. But the input rows vary in length. For example, in Example 0's input, each row has 21 elements, and the output rows have 10. So perhaps the first 10 elements after some filtering or transformation.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the first output array is [0,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,2]. Looking at the corresponding input row (the 11th input array in Example 0), it's [0,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,8,8,0,8]. The first 10 elements are [0,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,2], which matches the output. Then, the next elements are four zeros. So the output is the first part of the input array up to the four zeros. Wait, but the four zeros start at index 10, which is after the first 10 elements. So the output is just the first 10 elements of the input array. But why would that be the case for all the outputs?\n\nLooking at the other example. In Example 1, the first output row is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3], which is 9 elements long. The corresponding input row is [2,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3]. The first 9 elements are [2,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0], which doesn't match the output. So that theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that come after the four zeros. For example, in Example 0's first output array, the input has four zeros starting at index 10, and the elements after that are 8,8,0,8, etc., but the output is made of 0s and 2s. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the four zeros are a marker, and the output is the part of the array that comes after the four zeros. But in Example 0's output arrays, the numbers are 0 and 2, which are present in the input arrays after the four zeros. Wait, in the 11th input array of Example 0, after the four zeros, we have 8,8,0,8,8,0,8. But the output is 0 and 2s. Hmm, this doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the four zeros are part of a vertical separator in the 2D grid. For example, if the input arrays are arranged as rows of a matrix, the four zeros form a vertical column. The output could be the rows to the left or right of that column. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, each array has 21 elements. Let's imagine it's 21 columns. The four zeros in each row are at positions 10-13 (assuming 0-based indexing). So columns 10-13 are all zeros. Then, the output arrays are 10 elements long. So perhaps the output is the first 10 elements of each row (columns 0-9), which are before the four zeros. That matches Example 0's first output: the 11th input row's first 10 elements are [0,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,2], which is the output.\n\nChecking another example. In Example 1, the input rows have varying lengths, but let's see. For the first output row of Example 1, the input row has length 19. If the four zeros are at positions 10-13 (assuming), then the first 9 elements would be the part before. But the output is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3], which is 9 elements. Wait, in the input row, the four zeros are at positions 7-10 (indices 7,8,9,10: 0,0,0,0). So the part after would be from index 11 onwards, which is [3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3], but the output starts with 0. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in each input array, the four consecutive zeros are a marker, and the output is the part after those zeros. For Example 0's input arrays, after the four zeros, there's 8s and other numbers. But in the output of Example 0, the arrays are made of 0s and 2s. That doesn't match. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that the output consists of the rows that contain a certain number (like 2 in Example 0, 3 in Example 1, 4 in Example 2) and those rows are after the rows with all zeros. Looking at the examples:\n\nIn Example 0, the input has several rows of 8s and 0s, then some rows of 2s. The output is the rows that contain 2s. Similarly, in Example 1, the output rows are those with 3s, which are after the rows of zeros. In Example 2, the output rows are those with 4s. Also, in the input, the rows with 4s are after the rows of zeros.\n\nLooking at the Test Input, the input arrays have some rows with 1s and 3s, and then several rows of zeros, followed by rows with 3s. So following the pattern from the examples, the output should be the rows that contain the number 3, which are after the rows of zeros.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\nThe first few rows have 1s and 3s, but then there are rows of zeros (indices 6-9). After that, starting from index 10, the rows have 3s. So the output should be the rows from index 10 onwards that contain 3s.\n\nLet's check the Test Input:\n\nTest Input rows:\n\nRow 10: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]\n\nRow 11: [0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,3,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow 12: [3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow 13: [3,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3]\n\nRow 14: [0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,0]\n\nThese rows contain 3s. So according to the pattern observed in the training examples, the output should consist of these rows, but possibly truncated or transformed.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, in Example 0, the output rows are the ones that contain 2s, but they are trimmed to 10 elements. Similarly, in Example 1, the output rows are the ones with 3s, varying in length, but in the example, the outputs are the parts after the four zeros? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the Test Input, the output should be the rows that come after the all-zero rows and contain the new number (3 in this case). So rows 10 to 14.\n\nBut the Test Input's output needs to be in the same format as the training outputs. For example, in Example 0, the output is the list of arrays that have 2s, each array being a row from the input that contains 2s, but possibly trimmed.\n\nLooking at the Test Input's rows after the zeros:\n\nRow 10: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]\n\nBut the training examples' outputs sometimes truncate the arrays. For instance, in Example 0's output, the arrays are 10 elements long, which matches the part before the four zeros. However, in the Test Input, the four zeros are in rows 6-9. Wait, the Test Input's rows 6-9 are all zeros, and then the rows after (10-14) contain 3s. So maybe the output is these rows (10-14), but perhaps each output array is the part before the four zeros in their respective rows. But how to determine where the four zeros are in each row.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the Test Input's rows 10-14:\n\nRow 10: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]\n\nIs there a sequence of four zeros in this row? Let's check. The elements are 3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,3. Here, indices 1-4 are four zeros (0,0,0,0). So maybe the output is the elements before these four zeros. That would be the first element [3], but the output would need to be longer. Alternatively, the four zeros are in the middle of the row, and the output is the part after. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is all the rows that contain the new number (3 in the Test Input) and are after the all-zero rows. Then, for each such row, the output is the part before the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros. But how to determine that.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, in Example 0, each output row is the part before the four zeros. For example, the first output row in Example 0 is [0,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,2], which is from the input row that has four zeros starting at index 10. So the first 10 elements of that input row are the output.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the first output row is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3], which comes from an input row where the four zeros are at a certain position. For instance, in the corresponding input row, the four zeros are at indices 7-10. The elements after that would start at index 11, but the output row in Example 1 starts with 0, which is part of the four zeros. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that come after the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros. For Example 0, the input row has four zeros at indices 10-13. The elements after are 8,8,0,8, etc. But the output is 0s and 2s, which don't match. So this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the four zeros are not in the same row. Perhaps the input is a 2D grid where each row is part of the grid, and the four zeros form a vertical block. For example, if multiple rows have zeros in the same column positions, creating a vertical separator. Then, the output could be the columns to the left or right of that vertical separator.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, each row has four zeros starting at position 10-13 (assuming 0-based). So if we imagine all rows stacked, there's a vertical block of four zeros in columns 10-13. The output is the columns before this block. For each row, take the first 10 columns (columns 0-9), which would explain why the output rows are 10 elements long. Similarly, in Example 1, the four zeros are in columns 10-13 (assuming), and the output is columns 11 onwards. But Example 1's output rows vary in length. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the four zeros are part of a vertical separator, and the output is the part to the right of this separator. Let's check Example 1's first output row. If the four zeros are columns 10-13, then the part after would be columns 14 onwards. In the input row for Example 1's first output, columns 14 onwards are [3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3], but the output is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3]. This doesn't align. So this might not be the case.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a pattern in the numbers. In Example 0, the input arrays have 8s and 0s initially, then 2s appear. The output arrays consist of the 2s sections. Similarly, in Example 1, the 3s appear after the all-zero rows, and the output is those 3s. Example 2's output is the rows with 4s. So the pattern is: after the block of all-zero rows, the following rows contain a new number (2,3,4 in examples 0,1,2 respectively), and those rows are the output. Additionally, each output row is trimmed to exclude the trailing zeros or some delimiter.\n\nIn the Test Input, after the all-zero rows (rows 6-9), the subsequent rows (10-14) contain 3s. So the output should be these rows, possibly trimmed.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the rows after the all-zero rows are included in the output. For instance, in Example 0's input, rows 0-9 have 8s and 0s, then rows 10-20 have 2s and 0s, and the output is those rows (rows 11-20) but only the parts before the four zeros. Wait, but in Example 0's input, the four zeros are in each row, not in separate rows. So perhaps the output is the rows that come after the all-zero rows, and each output row is the part before the four zeros in that row.\n\nBut how to determine where the four zeros are in each row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the four zeros are in the same position across all rows, forming a vertical separator. For example, in Example 0, each row has four zeros starting at column 10. So columns 0-9 are taken for the output. Similarly, in Example 1, the four zeros are at columns 10-13, so output is columns 14 onwards. But this doesn't hold for Example 1's output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the rows that come after the all-zero rows, and for each such row, take the part before the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros.\n\nIn the Test Input, after rows 6-9 (all zeros), the rows 10-14 have 3s. Each of these rows may have four consecutive zeros somewhere. We need to find in each of these rows the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros and take the elements before that.\n\nLet's check row 10 of the Test Input: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]. Here, the first four consecutive zeros are from indices 1-4 (0,0,0,0). So the elements before that would be [3], which is not enough. But maybe the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros is later. Let's see. The elements are:\n\nIndices: 0:3, 1:0, 2:0, 3:0, 4:0, 5:3, 6:0, 7:0, 8:3, etc. So the first four consecutive zeros are at indices 1-4. So the part before would be [3], which doesn't match the expected output. But the output in the training examples had longer arrays. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the four zeros are a vertical block across multiple rows. For example, in the Test Input, after the all-zero rows (rows 6-9), the next rows have 3s. Perhaps the four zeros are in columns 10-13, and the output is the left part (columns 0-9). Let's see:\n\nRow 10 of Test Input: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]. The first 10 elements are [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3]. This would be one of the output rows.\n\nRow 11: [0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,3,3,0,0,0]. First 10 elements: [0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3].\n\nRow 12: [3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]. First 10 elements: [3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0].\n\nRow 13: [3,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3]. First 10 elements: [3,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,3].\n\nRow 14: [0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,0]. First 10 elements: [0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nSo if the output is the first 10 elements of each of these rows, then the Test Input's output would be these arrays. But looking at the training examples:\n\nIn Example 0, the outputs are the first 10 elements of the rows after the all-zero rows. Yes, this seems to fit. Each output row in Example 0 is 10 elements long, which matches the first 10 elements of the input rows containing 2s.\n\nIn Example 1, the output rows are varying lengths. For instance, the first output row in Example 1 is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3], which is 9 elements. But the corresponding input row's first 9 elements are [2,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0], which doesn't match. So this theory doesn't hold for Example 1.\n\nWait, maybe the number of elements to take depends on where the four zeros are located. For example, in each row, after the all-zero rows, take the elements up to the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros. Let's check this:\n\nIn Test Input row 10: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]. The first four consecutive zeros are at indices 1-4. So the part before is [3], and the part after is [3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]. But the output would need to be [3], which doesn't fit the pattern. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the four zeros are not in the same row but form a vertical block. For example, in the Test Input, after the all-zero rows (rows 6-9), the next rows (10-14) may have four zeros in columns 10-13. So for each row, take the first 10 columns (0-9) and ignore the rest. Then, the output would be:\n\nRow 10: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3]\n\nRow 11: [0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow 12: [3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow 13: [3,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow 14: [0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThese are the first 10 elements of each row after the all-zero rows. Comparing this to the training examples:\n\nIn Example 0, each output row is the first 10 elements of the rows after the all-zero rows. This holds true. For Example 1, the first output row is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3], which is the first 9 elements of the corresponding input row (but the input row's first 9 elements don't match). However, maybe in Example 1, the four zeros are in columns 10-13, and the output is columns 0-8 (9 elements), which would align with the output length. Let's check:\n\nInput row for Example 1's first output row: [2,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3]. The first 9 elements are [2,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0]. The output is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3]. These don't match. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is quite tricky. Let's try to think differently. \n\nLooking at the Test Input's rows after the all-zero rows (rows 10-14), each of these rows contains the number 3. The output should include these rows, possibly modified. The training examples show that after the all-zero rows, the output consists of the new number introduced (2,3,4). The output rows in the examples are the same as the input rows but with the original numbers replaced by the new number. But this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the rows that follow the all-zero rows, but with certain transformations. For example, in Example 0, the output rows have 2s where the input had 8s, but that's not the case. The input rows have 2s in their elements. So maybe the output is simply the rows after the all-zero rows, trimmed to a certain length. \n\nIn the Test Input, the rows after the all-zero rows are 10-14. Each of these rows has 17 elements. The output in Example 0's case was the first 10 elements of each such row. If we apply the same here, the output would be:\n\nFor row 10: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3]\n\nRow 11: [0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow 12: [3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow 13: [3,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow 14: [0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis would align with Example 0's pattern, where each output row is the first 10 elements of the rows after the all-zero rows. Similarly, in Example 1, the first output row is [0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3], which is 9 elements. But perhaps in that case, the rows are of varying lengths and not all have 10 elements. However, the Test Input's rows after the all-zero rows have 17 elements each, so taking the first 10 seems plausible.\n\nBut the Test Input's output should match the format of the training examples. For example, in Example 2, the output rows are 6 elements each, which corresponds to the first 6 elements of the rows after the all-zero rows. So the pattern might be that the number of elements in the output corresponds to the position of the four zeros in each row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is all the elements in the rows after the all-zero rows, but only up to the first occurrence of the delimiter (four zeros). So for each row after the all-zero rows, find where the four consecutive zeros are, and take the elements before that.\n\nIn Test Input row 10: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]. The first occurrence of four consecutive zeros is at indices 1-4. The elements before that are [3], but that's not enough. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the four zeros are not in the individual rows but in the entire dataset. For example, the four zeros are part of a vertical separator across multiple rows. But this is getting too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the possible patterns, I think the most consistent pattern across the training examples is that the output consists of the rows that come after the block of all-zero rows, and each output row is the part before the four consecutive zeros in that row. For the Test Input, the rows after the all-zero rows (10-14) need to be processed by taking the elements before the first occurrence of four consecutive zeros.\n\nLet's check Test Input row 10: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]. The first four consecutive zeros are at indices 1-4 (elements 0,0,0,0). The part before that is [3], which is just the first element. This doesn't form a valid output array. So this approach may not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the four consecutive zeros are part of the previous rows (the all-zero rows). For example, in the Test Input, rows 6-9 are all zeros. So perhaps the output is the rows after that, and each output row is the entire row. But the training examples show that the output rows are shorter than the input rows. For example, in Example 0, input rows are 21 elements, output rows are 10. So this suggests that the output rows are truncated.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output rows are the ones that contain the new number (3 in the Test Input), and they are truncated to the length of the first occurrence of the new number in the training examples. But this is vague.\n\nAfter struggling, I think the most plausible pattern is that in each training example, the output is the rows that come after the all-zero rows, and each output row is truncated to the first N elements, where N is the position of the four consecutive zeros in that row. For example, in Example 0, each output row is the elements before the four zeros, which are at position 10, so the first 10 elements. In Example 1, the four zeros are at different positions, leading to varying output lengths. But this requires each row to have four consecutive zeros.\n\nLooking back at the Test Input's rows after the all-zero rows:\n\nRow 10: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]. Four zeros at indices 1-4. So elements before are [3].\n\nRow 11: [0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,3,3,0,0,0]. Four zeros at indices 6-9 (0,0,0,3). No, indices 6-9 are 0,0,0,3. Not four zeros. So no four zeros here.\n\nRow 12: [3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]. Four zeros at indices 5-8 (0,0,0,3). No.\n\nRow 13: [3,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3]. Four zeros at indices 6-9 (0,0,0,0). Elements before: [3,0,3,0,3,0].\n\nRow 14: [0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,0]. Four zeros at indices 4-7 (0,0,0,0). Elements before: [0,3,3,0].\n\nSo for these rows, only rows 10 and 13 have four consecutive zeros. But this would mean the output includes only those rows, which doesn't match the training examples. \n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent across the examples, or I'm missing something. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis: the output is the rows after the all-zero rows, taking the first 10 elements for each row. For the Test Input, the output would be:\n\n[3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3]\n[0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]\n[3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0]\n[3,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,3]\n[0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example 2's outputs are 6 elements long. So this approach might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the output includes all elements of the rows after the all-zero rows, regardless of length. But Example 0's output arrays are 10 elements, which matches the first 10 elements of each row.\n\nGiven the Test Input's rows after the all-zero rows have varying lengths and structures, but following the pattern of Example 0, I'll assume the output is the first 10 elements of each of these rows.",
