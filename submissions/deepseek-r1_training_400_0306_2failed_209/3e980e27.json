        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices in the training examples, then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by analyzing each example to see what's changing.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. The input has some 1s and 2s. The output seems to have added some 1s and 2s in the lower rows. For instance, the row that was [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, ...] in the input becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, ...] in the output. The rows below that have new 1s. Maybe this is a cellular automaton-like rule, where each cell's state changes based on neighbors, or perhaps some kind of spreading or falling of numbers.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 4s and 3s. The output adds more 4s and 3s around them. For example, the row with [0, 0, 3, 0, ...] in the input becomes [0, 4, 3, 4, ...] in the output. Similarly, other areas have new 4s and 3s added. This looks like numbers are expanding outward, maybe in a diamond or cross pattern. Like each number might be generating adjacent cells of a certain value.\n\nExample 2's input has 8s, 3, 2. The output adds more 8s and 4s. For instance, in row 2, the input has [0, 0, 3, 8, 8, 0...], and the output adds 4s in adjacent positions. Also, in the row below the 3 in row 8, there are new 8s. Maybe higher numbers influence surrounding cells to become lower numbers, or there's a specific pattern based on the number's value.\n\nExample 3's input has 4s, 2s, 3s, 1s. The output adds 4s above certain structures. For example, the second row in input has [0, 0, 0, 2, 0...], and the output adds 4s around it. Also, near the bottom, 3s and 1s create a structure with 4s around them. It seems like numbers are being replicated in adjacent cells, perhaps based on their type. For example, 4s might generate 4s around them, or other numbers.\n\nLooking for commonalities across all examples. Each output seems to add new numbers around existing ones. For instance, in Example 0, the 2 in the input leads to a 1 and 2 below it. Maybe the rule is that each number generates a certain pattern below or around it. Alternatively, numbers could be \"falling\" down, but the positions don't exactly align with simple gravity.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps each number has a specific direction or pattern in which it propagates. For example, the number 1 might spread to the left and down, 2 to the right and down, etc. Alternatively, each number could have a certain shape that it creates when transformed. For example, 1 creates a pattern of cells below it, 4 creates a cross, etc.\n\nLooking at how numbers change in the outputs. In Example 1, the 3 is surrounded by 4s. Maybe 3s generate 4s in adjacent cells. Similarly, in Example 0, 2 and 1 in the input generate 1s below. Maybe each number has a certain \"radius\" where it adds numbers of the same or different type around it. For example, a 2 might add 1s around it, a 4 adds 4s in a cross, etc.\n\nAlternatively, think of each number as a \"seed\" that grows a specific structure. For example, in Example 0, the 2 and 1 in the input create a small structure below them. Let's check the positions. The input in Example 0 has at row 3, columns 3 and 4: 2 and 1. In the output, rows 8 and 9 have new 1s and 2s. Wait, maybe the numbers are moving downward, but that's not exactly the case. The initial 2 and 1 are in rows 3 and 4, but the new numbers are added in rows 8 and 9. That's a big jump. So maybe it's not simple movement. \n\nAnother thought: Maybe the numbers are part of a larger structure that is being mirrored or rotated. For example, the pattern in the input is mirrored vertically or horizontally, but that doesn't seem to fit all examples. \n\nAlternatively, the output could be the result of applying a convolution or kernel that transforms the input based on neighbor counts. For example, each cell in the output is determined by applying certain rules to the input cell and its neighbors. For instance, a cell with a certain number might cause adjacent cells to become a specific number if they meet conditions.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output again. The input has a 3 in row 6, column 2. The output in row 6, columns 1-3 are [0,4,3,4,0,...]. So the 3 is surrounded by 4s. The 4s in the input (like in row 2, column 6) are also generating more 4s around them. So perhaps 3s generate 4s in adjacent cells, and 4s generate more 4s in adjacent cells. But in the output, there's a cross pattern around the 3. So maybe each number type has a specific pattern of spreading.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 3 and 8s. The output adds 4s and 8s. The 3 in row 2, column 2 becomes part of a structure where 8s are extended. Maybe 3s generate 8s, and 8s generate 4s? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number N in the input creates a cross of N-1 around it. For example, a 4 would generate 3s around it, but in Example 1, 3 is surrounded by 4s, which contradicts that. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the 3 is surrounded by 4s. The 4s in the input (like row 2, column 6) generate a cross of 4s. So maybe the rule is: for each number N in the input, in the output, place N in the same position, and also place N in adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). But then why does 3 in Example 1's input lead to 4s around it? That doesn't fit. So maybe the number being spread is different from the original.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number N in the input generates a certain number of Ns in adjacent cells. But in Example 0, the 2 and 1 might generate 1s below them. Wait, in Example 0's input, there's a 2 at row 3, column 4, and 1s at row 4, columns 3-4. The output in rows 8 and 9 (which are lower) have 1s and 2s. Maybe the numbers are copied downward, but how many rows? It's unclear.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the differences between input and output in each example, to see what's added.\n\nIn Example 0's output, new 1s and 2s appear in rows 8 and 9. The original 2 and 1s are in rows 3-5. The new elements are two rows below the original. Maybe each element is duplicated a certain number of rows below. For example, the 2 in row 3, column 4 is duplicated in row 8, column 7. That's a shift of +5 rows and +3 columns. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe mirrored.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of the original input and some transformed version. Like, the input is overlaid with a shifted or rotated version of itself. For example, the output in Example 0 has the original structure plus a flipped or rotated copy.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the numbers in the output. Maybe the output is generated by taking each non-zero cell in the input and creating a certain pattern around it. For instance, a 1 in the input might generate a 1 to the left and below, a 2 might generate a 1 to the right and below, etc. \n\nIn Example 3's input, the row with [0,0,0,2,0...] becomes [0,0,4,2,0...] in the output. So a 4 is added to the left of the 2. Then, looking at the output, the 2 is surrounded by 4s. So maybe 2 generates 4s in adjacent cells. But in Example 0, the 2 is not generating 4s. Hmm, conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number is part of a different layer, and the output combines these layers. For example, 1s generate one pattern, 2s another, etc. But it's hard to see.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has 4s and 3. The output has 4s forming a cross around the 3, and also expanding other 4s. So perhaps when a 3 is present, it's surrounded by 4s, and existing 4s generate more 4s around them. Maybe each number has a specific way of propagating.\n\nLooking at the numbers in Example 1:\n\nInput row 2 has [0,0,0,0,0,4,3,4,0...]. Output row 2 is the same. But in the output, rows 6,7,8 have new 4s and 3. The 3 in the input (row 6, column 2) is surrounded by 4s in the output (row 6, columns 1-3: 0,4,3,4). Then, rows 9 and 10 have more 4s and 3. So maybe each 3 in the input creates a cross of 4s around it, and each 4 creates a cross of 4s around it as well.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3's input, the 3 in row 9, column 5 leads to in the output a structure around it with 1s and 3. For example, in row 8, column 5 is 1, and row 9, columns 4 and 5 are 1 and 3. So maybe 3s generate 1s in adjacent cells?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number generates a certain number of cells of a lower value. For example, 4 generates 3s around it, 3 generates 2s, etc. But in Example 1, 3 is generating 4s, which are higher. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe numbers create a certain shape. Like 3 creates a cross of 4s, and 4 creates a cross of 4s again. So 3 acts as a center for 4s, and 4s spread more 4s. That could explain Example 1's output.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 and 1s are in the input. The output has new 1s and 2s below. Maybe 1s and 2s generate copies below them. For example, a 1 generates a 1 to the left and below, and a 2 generates a 2 to the right and below. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 0's output, the new 1s and 2s form a sort of diamond shape. The original 2 and 1 are in the middle, and the new ones are arranged around them. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of each number as a direction. For example, 1 moves down-left, 2 moves down-right. So in Example 0's input, the 2 (row 3, column 4) would move down-right, ending up in row 8, column 7. Similarly, the 1s move down-left. That could explain the positions. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2 is at (3,4) (assuming rows start at 0). The output's 2 is at (8,7). The difference is +5 rows, +3 columns. So if each step moves down and to the right by 1 each time, 5 steps would be 5 down and 5 right. But 3 columns moved. Hmm. Alternatively, the movement is 1 down and 1 right each time. But the original 2 is at row 3, column 4. If it moves 5 times, it would be at row 8, column 9. But the output's 2 is at column 7. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers \"fall\" down until they hit something. But in Example 0, the 2 and 1s are already at the bottom of some structure. Maybe the numbers generate new numbers below in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, think of each number as a cell in a grid that, in the next step (output), produces a certain number of cells around it according to rules. For example, 1 becomes two 1s below, 2 becomes a 1 and a 2 diagonally, etc.\n\nAnother approach: check if the output is the input plus some transformation. For example, in Example 0's input, the output adds new elements in lower rows. Maybe the rule is that each non-zero cell generates a copy shifted down by a certain number of rows. For example, 2 in row 3 generates a copy in row 8 (5 rows down), and 1 in row 4 generates copies in row 9 (5 rows down). That seems possible. Then, in Example 1, a 3 in row 6 (assuming rows start at 0) would generate copies 5 rows down, but the output in Example 1's row 6 (original row 6) has the 3 with 4s added around it, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is a fixed amount. For example, shifting down by 5 rows. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the original 2 is at row 3 (0-based), column 3. Shifting down by 5 rows would be row 8, same column. But in the output, the 2 is at row 8, column 7. So column shifted by +3. That doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, this approach might not be correct.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output again. The input has a 3 at row 9, column 5 (assuming first row is 0). The output has a 3 in row 9, column 5, and a 1 to the left (column 4), and another 1 below in row 10, column 5. Wait, no, in the output for Example 3, the row 8 has [0,0,0,0,1,1,0...], row 9 has [0,0,0,1,3,1,0...], and row 10 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4...]. So the 3 in the input leads to a cross-shaped pattern around it in the output. The 3 is surrounded by 1s. So maybe each number N generates a cross of (N-1) around it. For example, 3 generates 2s around it, but in Example 3, it's generating 1s. Doesn't fit. Or 3 generates 1s, 4 generates 3s, etc. But in Example 1, the 3 generates 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number N generates a cross of (N) around it, but that would make 3 generate 3s. But in Example 1, the 3 is surrounded by 4s. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by a combination of different rules for each number. For example, 1s spread in one pattern, 2s in another, etc. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- Input has 1s and 2s. Output adds more 1s and a 2 below. Maybe 1s generate 1s below them, and 2s generate 1s to the sides. For instance, the 2 in row 3, column 4 could generate 1s to the left and right below. \n\nIn Example 0's output, the 2 is still present in row 3, column 4, and there's a new 2 in row 8, column 7. Wait, the new 2 is in a different position. Maybe each 2 generates a 1 to the southwest and a 2 to the southeast? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers in the output are a combination of the input and some transformation. Maybe each number in the input is mirrored across the vertical center line and placed shifted down. For example, in Example 0, the original 2 and 1 are in the upper part, and mirrored in the lower part. Let me check:\n\nThe original 2 is at row 3 (if rows start at 0), column 3. The mirrored position would be row 9 (since 13 rows total; 13-1-3=9). Column mirrored would be 12-3=9. But in the output, the new 2 is at row 8, column 7. Doesn't match. So maybe not a mirror.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are rotated 180 degrees. So the original 2 at (3,3) would be at (9,9) in a 13x13 grid. But the output's 2 is at (8,7). Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the output might be the input plus a shifted version of itself. For example, shifting the input down by some rows and right by some columns, then adding to the original. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the main cluster is in rows 3-5. The output adds a cluster in rows 8-10. If the shift is 5 rows down and 3 columns right, adding the shifted input to the original might produce the output. Let's check:\n\nOriginal 2 at (3,3) shifted 5 down and 3 right would be (8,6). But in the output, the 2 is at (8,7). Close but not exact. The 1 from (4,3) would shift to (9,6), but in the output, the 1 is at (9,6). The 1 at (4,4) shifts to (9,7), but output has 1s at (8,6) and (9,6). Maybe not exactly. \n\nBut maybe this approach is possible. For example, the output is the original input plus the input shifted down by 5 rows and right by 3 columns. Let's see in Example 0:\n\nOriginal input's non-zero cells:\n\nRow 3: column 3 (2), 4 (1)\nRow 4: columns 3 (1),4 (1)\nRow 5: column 5 (1)\nRow 8: column 7 (2)\n\nShifted by 5 rows and 3 columns:\n\nRow 3+5=8, column 3+3=6: 2 would be at (8,6). But in output, row 8, column7 has 2. Hmm. Close but not matching. Alternatively, shifted by 5 rows and 4 columns. Then 3+5=8, 3+4=7: matches. So the shifted 2 is at (8,7), which is present in the output. Similarly, row 4, column3 (1) shifted becomes (9,6). Which in the output, row9 has a 1 at column6 and 7. So this could fit. So maybe the output is the input plus the same input shifted down 5 and right 4. But why 5 and 4? How to determine the shift amount.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The main cluster is in rows 1-3. The output's new clusters are in rows 5-7 and 9-10. If the shift is 4 rows down and 2 columns right. Original row 2 (input row with 4,3,4) shifted 4 down would be row 6. In the output, row6 has [0,4,3,4,0...], which is the original row 2's data shifted. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is 5 rows and 3 columns, like Example0. Let's see. Example1's input has a 3 at row6 (assuming 0-based?), column2. Shifting 5 rows down would be row11, but the output has new elements in rows5-7. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift varies per example. That complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number in the input generates a copy in a diagonal direction. For example, 1s generate down-left, 2s generate down-right. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's input, the 2 at (3,4) could generate a 2 at (4,5), but in the output, the 2 is still at (3,4) and there's a new 2 at (8,7). So maybe multiple steps of movement. Like a diagonal movement each step. But how many steps?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a time step later in a cellular automaton. For example, the input is generation 0, output is generation 1. The rules would dictate how each cell evolves. Let's think of possible rules.\n\nLooking at Example0's input and output. The 2 and 1 in the input remain, and new 1s and 2 are added below. Maybe cells \"fall\" down if there's space. But the new cells are not directly below. Or they spread in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, it's a sand simulation where 1 and 2 represent different particles that fall down and to the sides. For example, 1s fall down and to the left, 2s fall down and to the right. In Example0's input, the 1s would fall down and left, creating a pattern below. The 2 would fall down and right. Let's see:\n\nOriginal 1s at row4, column3 and 4. Falling down and left would move to row5, column2 and 3. But in the output's row5, column5 is 1. Not matching. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, each number generates a pattern below them. For example, a 1 generates a 1 to the left and down, and a 1 to the right and down. But I need to see.\n\nAlternatively, think of the numbers as centers of a diamond-shaped structure. For example, each number N creates a diamond of radius 1 (adjacent cells) with N's value. But in Example1, the 3 is surrounded by 4s, which are different. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's try to find a pattern that's consistent across all examples.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nInput has 3 in row6, column2. Output has 4s around it (up, down, left, right). The 4s in the input (row2, column6 and 7) generate 4s around them. The output in rows5-7 has new 4s forming crosses around the original 4s and 3.\n\nSimilarly, in Example3, the 3 in the input is surrounded by 1s in the output, and the 4s are surrounded by 4s. Maybe the rule is that each non-zero cell in the input generates a cross of the same value around it. But then why does 3 in Example1 generate 4s?\n\nWait, in Example1's input, the 3 is surrounded by 4s in the output. The original 3 is still there. So maybe the 3 turns into a cross of 4s. But why? Unless the 3 is a different type that generates 4s. So perhaps each number generates a cross of a different number. Like:\n\n- 1 generates 1s around it.\n- 2 generates 1s.\n- 3 generates 4s.\n- 4 generates 4s.\n- 8 generates 4s or 8s.\n- etc.\n\nBut how to confirm this.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nInput has 1s and 2s. Output has more 1s and 2s. For instance, the 2 in the input remains, and a new 2 appears lower. The 1s also spread. If 2 generates 1s and a new 2, but 1s generate 1s. Let's see:\n\nOriginal 2 at (3,4) in input. Output has a new 2 at (8,7), and surrounding 1s. So maybe the 2 generates a 2 shifted down and right, and 1s around.\n\nOriginal 1s at (4,3) and (4,4) generate new 1s below. For example, in output row9, columns6 and 7 are 1s. So perhaps each 1 generates a 1 below and to the left or right.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's try to see if there's a pattern where each number N in the input generates a cross (up, down, left, right) of a certain other number. For example:\n\n- 1 \u2192 generates 1s in cross directions.\n- 2 \u2192 generates 1s in cross directions.\n- 3 \u2192 generates 4s in cross directions.\n- 4 \u2192 generates 4s in cross directions.\n- 8 \u2192 generates 4s or 8s.\n\nBut in Example0, the 2 generates 1s. So in the input's row3, column4 (2), the output would have 1s around it. But in the output, the original 2 is still there, and the new 1s are in row8, column6 and 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe numbers generate new cells in a diagonal pattern. For example, 2 generates cells to the southeast (down-right), and 1 generates southwest (down-left). Let's check:\n\nIn Example0's input, 2 is at (3,4). Southeast direction would be moving down-right each step. So after 5 steps, it would be at (8,9), but in the output, it's at (8,7). Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each number N generates a new number N in a specific direction each time. For example, 2 moves down-right once, then again, etc. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Each non-zero cell in the input causes a certain pattern of cells to be added in the output. The pattern depends on the number. For instance:\n\n- 1: Add 1s diagonally down-left and down-right.\n- 2: Add 1s down-left and down-right, and a 2 directly below.\n- 3: Add 4s in cross directions.\n- 4: Add 4s in cross directions.\n- 8: Add 8s in cross directions, and 4s around them.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nLooking at Example3's output. The input's 2 in row1, column3 becomes surrounded by 4s. The 3 in row9, column5 generates a cross of 1s around it. The 4s in the input generate more 4s around them. So maybe:\n\n- 2 generates 4s in cross directions.\n- 3 generates 1s in cross directions.\n- 4 generates 4s in cross directions.\n\nBut then in Example0's input, the 2 would generate 4s around it, but in the output, there's no 4s near the original 2. Instead, new 1s and 2s appear lower. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is more complex. Perhaps each number N in the input adds a certain pattern of numbers that depends on N's value, possibly combining with other numbers. For example, 1 and 2 interact to form a certain structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by applying a certain number of iterations of a cellular automaton rule. For example, each cell in the output is determined by the input cells in a certain way. But without knowing the number of iterations or the rules, this is hard.\n\nLet's try to think of each example's output as the input plus added patterns based on certain rules. For example:\n\nIn Example1's input, the 3 and 4s are present. The output adds cross patterns around them. So the rule could be: for each non-zero cell, add a cross of a certain number around it.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the cell is 3, add a cross of 4s.\n- If the cell is 4, add a cross of 4s.\n- If the cell is 1 or 2, add a cross of 1s.\n\nBut in Example0's input, the 2 would generate 1s around it, which would explain the new 1s. But in the output of Example0, the 2 in row3, column4 remains, and new 1s appear lower. But the cross around the 2 would be in row2-4 and columns3-5. But in Example0's output, there's no cross near the original 2, but new elements lower down. So maybe this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, the cross is added in the output but shifted. Like, the cross is placed a certain number of rows below. For example, the original cell's cross is added 5 rows below and 3 columns to the right. But this is getting too specific.\n\nAnother approach: Look at the positions of new elements in the output relative to the input. For example, in Example0's input, the main cluster is around rows3-5. The new cluster is in rows8-10. The vertical distance is 5 rows. Similarly, horizontal distance might vary. Maybe each cluster is copied 5 rows below and 3 columns to the right. \n\nIn Example0's input, the original 2 is at (3,4). The copied cluster would be at (8,7). Let's see: row3+5=8, column4+3=7. Yes. The 2 is copied to (8,7). The 1 at (4,3) would be copied to (9,6). In the output, row9, column6 is 1. Similarly, the 1 at (4,4) would be copied to (9,7), which is part of the output's row9. So this fits. \n\nIn Example1's input, the 3 is at row6, column2. Copied 5 rows down and 3 columns right would be row11, column5. But the output's new elements are in rows5-7 and 9-10, which doesn't fit. So maybe this pattern only applies to certain examples. \n\nIn Example3's input, the 3 is at row9, column5. Shifting 5 rows down would go beyond the grid (13 rows). So perhaps the shift is 5 rows down and 3 columns right, but wrapping around or truncating. But Example3's output has new elements above the original 3. For example, row8 and 9 have new 1s and 3s. So this approach doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is dynamic. For example, each cluster is shifted down by half the grid's height. For a 13-row grid, half is 6.5, so 6 rows. But in Example0, shifting 6 rows down from row3 would be row9. The original 2 in row3, column4 would shift to row9, column4+3=7. Which matches the output's 2 in row8, column7. Close but not exact. \n\nAlternatively, the shift is 5 rows down and 3 columns right. This worked for Example0. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample2's input has a 3 at row2, column2. Shifting 5 rows down and 3 columns right would be row7, column5. Looking at Example2's output, the 3 is still present, but there's a new 3 in row8, column2. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the shift varies per example based on some factor. Maybe the number of rows is 13, and the shift is to the mirror row. For example, row i is mirrored to row 12 - i. Let's check Example0:\n\nOriginal 2 in row3, column4. Mirrored row would be 12-3=9. So row9, column4. In the output, the 2 is at row8, column7. Doesn't fit. \n\nAnother idea: The output is the input plus the input rotated 180 degrees. For example, flipping the input top-bottom and left-right. Let's see Example0:\n\nOriginal 2 at row3, column4. Rotated 180 would be at row9 (12-3=9), column8 (12-4=8). In the output, the new 2 is at row8, column7. Close but not exactly. \n\nAlternatively, rotated 180 and shifted. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: The output seems to have structures that are symmetrical or extensions of the input's structures. For example, in Example0, the original cluster is small, and the output extends it downward. In Example1, the 3 and 4s are expanded into larger crosses. Example3 has 4s added around the original 2 and 3. \n\nPerhaps the rule is: for each non-zero cell in the input, generate a cross (up, down, left, right) of cells with the same value. Additionally, for certain values (like 3), generate a different value in the cross.\n\nFor Example1's 3 in the input, generating 4s around it. For 4s, generating 4s. For Example3's 2, generating 4s around it. For Example0's 1s and 2s, generating 1s.\n\nBut in Example0's input, the 2 in row3, column4 would generate 2s in cross directions. But in the output, there's no 2s around it. Instead, new 2 appears lower. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. Maybe the cross is generated in the output, but the original cell's value is replaced. For example, the 3 generates 4s around it and is itself replaced. But in Example1's output, the 3 is still present, surrounded by 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example3's output: The 2 in the input (row1, column3) is surrounded by 4s. The 3 in row9, column5 is surrounded by 1s. The 4s in the input are surrounded by more 4s. So perhaps:\n\n- 2 \u2192 surrounded by 4s.\n- 3 \u2192 surrounded by 1s.\n- 4 \u2192 surrounded by 4s.\n- 1 \u2192 surrounded by 1s.\n\nSo each number N generates a cross of M around it, where M depends on N. For example:\n\n- N=1 \u2192 M=1\n- N=2 \u2192 M=4\n- N=3 \u2192 M=1\n- N=4 \u2192 M=4\n- N=8 \u2192 M=4\n\nBut then in Example0, the 2 would generate 4s around it, but the output doesn't show that. Instead, the 2 is still present, and new 1s are added below. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the generated cells are placed at a distance. For example, 2 generates 4s two cells away. But Example3's 2 has 4s adjacent. \n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is a combination of the input and a certain kernel convolution. For example, each cell in the output is the sum of the input cell and its neighbors multiplied by a kernel. For instance, a kernel that spreads the value to adjacent cells.\n\nBut I'm not sure how the numbers would translate in that case.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that each non-zero cell in the input is replaced by a 2x2 block of cells in the output. For example, a cell with value V becomes a 2x2 block of V. But looking at Example0's input and output, this doesn't fit. The input has a 2 at (3,4), and the output has a 2 at (3,4) and (8,7). Not a 2x2 block.\n\nAlternatively, each cell generates a diagonal line of cells. For example, down and right. But Example0's 2 is copied down 5 rows and right 3 columns. Not sure.\n\nAnother possible angle: Each number N in the input generates a diamond-shaped pattern with radius N. For example, N=2 generates a diamond of 2s with radius 2 around it. But in Example0's input, the 2 would generate a diamond, but the output doesn't show that. \n\nAlternatively, each number N generates a square of size N x N around it. But this also seems unlikely.\n\nHmm. Let's try to think of the output as the input with some expansion. For example, each number expands in a specific direction or pattern. For example, in Example0, the 1s and 2s expand downward. In Example1, the 4s expand to form crosses. Example3's 4s expand upward.\n\nMaybe the rule is that each number expands upward, downward, left, and right by a certain number of steps. For example, 1 expands one cell in each direction, 2 expands two cells, etc. But in Example0's input, the 2 is in row3. Expanding downward two cells would reach row5, but the output's new 2 is in row8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each number N expands N cells in each direction. For example, 1 expands one cell, 2 expands two. But in Example3's input, the 3 would expand three cells, but the output's new elements are not three cells away.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Let's try to look for a pattern in the positions where new numbers are added.\n\nIn Example0's output, the new 2 is at (8,7). The original 2 is at (3,4). The difference is 5 rows and 3 columns. 5 and 3 are the numbers of the example index (0). But that might be a coincidence.\n\nIn Example1's output, new 4s are added around the 3. The difference in rows and columns varies.\n\nAlternatively, the number of new cells added depends on the example's index. Not likely, since the test input would need to follow.\n\nAnother Idea: The output includes both the original input and a reflected or transformed version of the input. For example, the input is overlaid with its own transformation, such as a diagonal flip or some other operation.\n\nFor instance, in Example0, the original cluster is in the upper-left, and the new cluster is in the lower-right, suggesting a diagonal reflection. Let's check:\n\nOriginal 2 at (3,4). Reflecting across the main diagonal (swap rows and columns) would be (4,3). Not matching. Reflecting across the anti-diagonal (row i, column j becomes row 12-j, column 12-i) for a 13x13 grid. Original (3,4) becomes (8,8). Output has 2 at (8,7). Close but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, reflecting and shifting. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm struggling to find a consistent pattern. Let's try to see if there's a common transformation across all examples.\n\nLooking at all examples, the output often has the original numbers plus new numbers added in specific patterns, often around existing clusters. It seems like each number is causing certain other numbers to appear in a structured way.\n\nPerhaps the rule is that each number N in the input generates a cross-shaped pattern of N's value around it, but in Example1's input, the 3 is generating 4s. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the cross-shaped pattern is of a different number based on N. For example:\n\n- 1 \u2192 cross of 1\n- 2 \u2192 cross of 1\n- 3 \u2192 cross of 4\n- 4 \u2192 cross of 4\n- 8 \u2192 cross of 4\n\nThis would explain Example1's 3 generating 4s. Example3's 2 generating 4s. But in Example0's input, the 2 would generate 1s around it, which could explain the new 1s. Let's check:\n\nExample0's input has a 2 at (3,4). Generating a cross of 1s would add 1s at (3,3), (3,5), (2,4), (4,4). In the output, the original 2 is at (3,4), and the row below (4,4) is already a 1. The output's new 1s are at (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), etc. So not directly around the original 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the cross is generated at a certain distance. For example, a few rows below. But how?\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the numbers represent different layers, and the output is a superposition of these layers. For example, each number's layer is processed separately, then combined. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers in the output are the sum of the input cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell has a number and a neighbor has a different number, the output cell is the sum. But this doesn't explain the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the result of each number causing certain other numbers to appear in specific directions. For example, 1 causes a 1 to the left and below, 2 causes a 1 to the right and below, 3 causes a 4 in all four directions, etc.\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\n- The 2 at (3,4) would generate a 1 to the right and below, leading to (4,5). But in the output, there's a 1 at (5,5). Which is in the input. So maybe this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, 2 generates a 2 down-right and 1s around. Not sure.\n\nThis is taking too long. Let's try to synthesize the examples:\n\nThe pattern seems to involve each non-zero cell generating new cells in specific positions, possibly based on their value. The new cells are often positioned below or around the original ones, but the exact mechanism is unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll try to hypothesize a rule based on the examples:\n\nFor each non-zero cell in the input:\n\n- If the cell is 1, generate 1s below and to the left and right.\n- If the cell is 2, generate 1s below and a 2 to the down-right.\n- If the cell is 3, generate 4s in a cross pattern around it.\n- If the cell is 4, generate 4s in a cross pattern around it.\n- If the cell is 8, generate 4s around it.\n- Etc.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nThe test input has:\n\nRow1: 1 at column2.\nRow2: 1 at column1, 2 at column2.\nRow3: 1s at columns1 and2.\nRow5: 8s at columns8-10.\nRow6: 3 at column9, 8 at column10.\nRow7: 8 at column9.\nRow9: 2 at column3.\nRow10: 3 at column7.\n\nApplying the rules:\n\n- The 1s (row1,2,3) would generate 1s below and to the sides. For example, row1, column2's 1 generates 1s in row2, columns1,2,3. But existing numbers may override.\n- The 2 in row2, column2 would generate 1s below and a 2 down-right. So in row3, column3, a 1 and a 2 in row3, column3. But row3 has 1s already.\n- The 3 in row6, column9 generates a cross of 4s around it. So row6, columns8-10 and row5, column9, row7, column9 would have 4s. But the input has 8s there. Perhaps 8s are replaced by 4s?\n- The 8s in rows5-7 generate 4s around them. So around each 8, add 4s.\n- The 3 in row10, column7 generates 4s around it.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but based on Example2's handling of 8s, which generated 4s, perhaps 8s in the test input would generate 4s around them. \n\nSo, applying these rules:\n\nFor the test input's 8s in rows5-7:\n\n- Each 8 generates 4s in the cross directions. So around each 8 in row5, columns8-10, add 4s up, down, left, right. But existing numbers may override. For example, the 8 in row5, column8 would generate 4s at row4,8; row6,8; row5,7; row5,9. But row5,9 is an 8, which would be replaced by 4. Similarly, the 8 in row6, column9 would generate 4s around it.\n\nThe 3 in row6, column9 generates 4s in cross directions. So row6, columns8-10 and rows5-7, column9 would have 4s. But the existing 8s and 3 might be replaced.\n\nThe 3 in row10, column7 generates 4s around it: row9,7; row11,7; row10,6; row10,8. \n\nThe 2 in row9, column3 generates 4s around it (based on Example3's 2 generating 4s). So row8,3; row10,3; row9,2; row9,4 would have 4s.\n\nThe 1s in rows1-3 generate 1s below and to the sides. For example, row1, column2's 1 would generate 1s at row2, columns1-3. But row2 already has a 1 and 2. So perhaps overlapping, but new 1s are added where possible.\n\nPutting this all together, the output would have:\n\n- 4s around the 8s and 3s.\n- 4s around the 2 in row9, column3.\n- 1s generated below the original 1s.\n\nFor example, in row6, column9 (3), the output would have 4s around it. The existing 8 in row6, column10 would generate 4s around it, possibly conflicting.\n\nThis is just a rough guess. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to format the answer based on these assumptions.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input and output grids, and I need to find out what transformation is happening. Let's look at the training examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some 2s and 1s in the middle rows. The output adds some 1s and 2s below the original positions. Like, in row 8 of the input, there's a 2 at position 7. In the output, rows 8 and 9 have new 1s around it. Maybe it's some kind of expansion or replication downwards?\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has a 3 surrounded by 4s. The output adds more 4s and 3s in a pattern. The 3 in row 6, column 2 of the input seems to generate a cross of 4s around it in the output. Then the 3 in row 9, column 9 in the input also creates a similar pattern below. So maybe each number is creating a specific shape around it in the output, possibly replicating itself with surrounding numbers?\n\nExample 2 has 3,8,8 in the input. The output adds 4s and 8s around. For instance, the 3 in row 2, column 2 in the input leads to 8s in the same row in the output. Also, the 8s in row 2, columns 3 and 4 are expanded into row 8, columns 2 and 3. Wait, maybe each number is causing certain numbers to appear in adjacent cells based on their value. Like 3 might generate 8s, or 4s generate 3s? Not sure yet.\n\nExample 3's input has 4s and 3s. The output seems to add layers around them. For example, the 3 in row 8, column 10 (value 3) creates a layer of 1s around it. The 4s in the input's row 1 and 2 get expanded with more 4s around. Maybe each number is acting as a seed, and the output is adding a layer of lower numbers around them. Like, a 4 might add 4s around it, a 3 adds 3s, but maybe the layer is one number less? Or perhaps each number generates a cross or plus shape of the same number around it.\n\nPutting it all together, the pattern might be that each non-zero number in the input generates a cross (up, down, left, right) of numbers one less than itself. For example, if there's a 4, it places 3s around it. Wait, in Example 1, the input has a 3, and the output has 4s around it. Wait that's conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nIn Example 1's input, there's a 3 at (2,6) and (6,2). The output around those 3s has 4s. So maybe the number is generating higher numbers around? Or perhaps the other way around. For instance, in Example 0, 2 and 1 are present. The output adds more 1s around the 2, perhaps. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 3 has 2 and 1. The output's row 8 adds a 1 next to the 2, and in row 9, two 1s below. Hmm, maybe it's a matter of the number's value determining how far it spreads. Like, a 2 would spread one cell in each direction, a 3 would spread two cells, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero cell in the input is creating a diamond shape (like a square rotated 45 degrees) of numbers decreasing by 1 with each layer. But looking at Example 1's 3 in row 2, column 6 (input) leads to 4s around it. Wait, 3's output has 4s. Maybe it's the opposite: each cell's value is increased by 1 in adjacent cells. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that each number in the input is creating a cross (up, down, left, right) of the same number. For example, a 4 would place 4s in adjacent cells. Let's check Example 1. The input has a 3 in row 2, column 6. The output around that 3 has 4s. Wait, that doesn't fit. Unless the numbers are increasing. Alternatively, maybe each non-zero cell is mirrored or shifted in a certain direction.\n\nAnother angle: in Example 0, the output seems to copy the input's patterns but shifted down. For example, the 2 in row 3, column 3 is present in the output, but there's a new 1 in row 8, column 6. Wait, not sure. Or maybe the output is the input plus some generated patterns below each non-zero cell.\n\nLooking at the test input now. The input has 1s, 2s, 3s, and 8s. For example, in row 1, column 2 there's a 1, row 2 has 1,2, etc. The 3 is in row 1, column 5. The 8s are in rows 5 and 6.\n\nIf the pattern is that each non-zero number generates a cross of the same number below it, then for the test input:\n\nRow 1, column 2 is 1: maybe place 1s below it. Row 2, column 2 is 1, but that's already present. The 3 in row 1, column 5 might generate a cross of 3s around it. But need to see how the previous examples did this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number creates a vertical line downward. For example, in Example 0's 2 in row 3, column 3, the output has 2 in the same spot, and maybe new numbers below. Wait, in Example 0's output, the 2 is in row 3, column 3, and then in row 8, column 7 there's a 2. Not sure how that's connected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number in the input is duplicated in a certain direction, possibly downward and to the sides, creating a sort of inverted V or pyramid. For instance, the 2 in Example 0's input leads to 1s around it in the output. So perhaps each number N creates a diamond shape of N-1 around it.\n\nIn Example 1, the 3 in the input creates 4s around it. So maybe it's N+1. But that's inconsistent with Example 0 where 2 creates 1s. So maybe it's the opposite: each number N creates N-1 around it. But 2 would produce 1s, 3 produces 2s, etc. But in Example 1, the 3 is surrounded by 4s, which contradicts that.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me re-examine the examples.\n\nExample 0 Input:\n\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, ...]\nRow 4: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, ...]\n\nOutput adds in row 8, column 6 a 1, and row 9 has 1s. Maybe the numbers are moving downward, leaving a trail. Like each non-zero cell is copied below, and the original is left. But in the output, the original numbers are still present, so it's not just moving. Perhaps the numbers are generating new numbers below them.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the input plus some generated patterns. For example, each non-zero cell in the input generates a certain number of cells in the output based on its value. For instance, a 1 might generate one cell below, a 2 two cells, etc. But how exactly?\n\nLooking at Example 3's output. The input has a 3 in row 9, column 4. The output in row 9, column 4-6 has 3,1, etc. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero cell creates a vertical line downward of the same number, length equal to the cell's value. For example, a 3 would create three copies below. Let's check Example 0's input. The 2 in row 3, column 4: does it create two copies below? In the output, row 4 has 1,1. Not sure. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, each number N creates a diamond-shaped area around it with radius N. For example, N=1 would affect adjacent cells, N=2 would two cells away, etc. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 in row 3, column 4. The output has a 1 in row 8, column 7. That's 5 rows below and 3 columns right. Not sure. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each non-zero cell is mirrored vertically. But in Example 0, the input's 2 is in row 3, and the output has some changes in lower rows. Maybe it's a combination of vertical mirroring and adding layers.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by applying some kind of cellular automaton rules. For example, cells with certain numbers influence their neighbors in the next step. But the input and output are the same size, so it's a single-step transformation.\n\nLooking back at Example 3's input and output. The input has a 3 in row 9, column 4. The output has a 1 in row 9, column 3-5, forming a cross. So 3 might create a cross of 1s. Wait, but in the same example, the 4s in row 1 create more 4s around them. So maybe each number N creates a cross of N's around it. For example, a 3 would place 3s in adjacent cells. But in Example 3's output, the 3 in row 9, column 4 is surrounded by 1s and 3. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, each number N in the input creates a cross of N-1 in adjacent cells. For instance, a 2 would put 1s around it, a 3 would put 2s. Let's check Example 1's input. The 3 in row 2, column 6 (input) is surrounded by 4s in the output. But 3-1=2, which doesn't match the 4s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's think differently. Maybe the output is the input with certain expansions. For example, in Example 0, the 2 and 1 in rows 3-5 are present in the output, and new 1s and 2s are added below them. Maybe each cluster of numbers generates a copy of themselves shifted down and to the sides, like a reflection.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 1's input: the 3 in row 2, column 6. The output has 4s forming a cross around it. So maybe each number N creates a cross of N+1 around it. Then 3 would generate 4s. In Example 0, the 2 would generate 3s, but the output shows 1s. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the 3 is still present, but surrounded by 4s. So maybe the 3 is generating 4s in adjacent cells, but the 3 remains. So the rule could be: for each non-zero cell, place (current cell's value +1) in the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). If that's the case, then:\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 3 would generate 4s around it. Which matches the output. In Example 0, the 2 would generate 3s around, but the output has 1s. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output. For each cell in the output, how is it determined from the input.\n\nTake Example 0. The input has 2 at (3,3). In the output, this remains. The new 1s appear at (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), etc. Maybe these new cells are determined by some relation to the original positions. For example, the original 2 is at row 3, column 3. The new 2 is at row 8, column 7. The difference is row +5, column +4. But that's arbitrary. Or perhaps it's mirrored vertically. Row 3 to row 8 is a difference of 5. Maybe the grid is mirrored around the middle row. The grid has 13 rows (0-12). Middle row is row 6. So row 3 is 3 rows above middle, mirrored would be row 9 (6+3). But in Example 0's output, the new 2 is at row 8. Close but not exact. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero cell in the input generates a duplicate in the same column but in the row symmetric to the middle. For 13 rows, middle is row 6. So row k would mirror to row 12 -k. For example, row 3 would mirror to row 9 (12-3=9). Looking at Example 0's input row 3, column 3 has a 2. Output row 9, column 7 has a 2. Wait, column 3 to 7? Not sure. Maybe not.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the input plus a reflected version over the vertical axis. But looking at Example 0's input, which has a 2 in column 3, but the output has new elements in different columns. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero cell in the input is generating a pattern downward. For example, the 2 in row 3, column 3 might create a diagonal going down and to the right. In Example 0's output, there's a 1 at row 5, column 5 (original 2 is at 3,3; 5-3=2 steps down, 5-3=2 steps right. Maybe each step down-right by N steps for value N. But 2 would mean two steps down and right. But in Example 0, the 2 at (3,3) leads to a 1 at (5,5)? In the output, row 5, column 5 has 1. Maybe the value decreases by 1 each step. So 2 becomes 1, then 0 (but 0 is not displayed). But in Example 0's output, the 1 is at row5, column5. Original 2 is at row3, column3. So two steps down and two steps right. Then 2 steps for value 2. Hmm, maybe. Then in Example 1, the 3 at row2, column6 would create a 2 three steps down and three steps right? Let's check. In the output of Example1, the 3 is at row2, column6. Three steps down is row5, three steps right is column9. Looking at Example1's output, row5, column9: in the input, row5 is all zeros. In the output, row5, column2 has a 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero cell creates a line downward and to the right, with each step decreasing the value by 1. For example, a 2 would have 2 steps: 2,1,0. So the 2 at (3,3) would place a 1 at (4,4), and 0 at (5,5) (which is not shown). In Example0's output, there's a 1 at row4, column4 (input's row4, column4 has 1). Not sure.\n\nThis isn't leading me anywhere. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the output is created by adding layers around the existing numbers. For example, in Example0, the 2 and 1 are in the input, and in the output, there's a layer of 1s and 2s around them. But the added layers are below. Maybe the numbers are \"falling\" down and spreading out.\n\nLooking at Example3's input and output. The 3 in row9, column4 leads to a cross of 1s and a 3 in the output. The 4s in row1, columns7-9 in the input become surrounded by more 4s in the output. So maybe each number creates a cross of the same number. For 4, the cross is added around it, but for 3, the cross is added below.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are generating a pattern that depends on their value. Like, 1s generate a certain shape, 2s generate another, etc. But it's hard to see the pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0's output, the new numbers added are in the same columns as the original numbers but lower rows. For example, the original 2 in row3, column3 leads to a 2 in row8, column7. Wait, not the same column. So maybe it's not just moving down.\n\nAlternatively, each number N creates a copy N rows below. The 2 in row3 would create a copy in row3+2=5. Looking at Example0's output, row5 has a 1 in column5. Original was 2 in row3, column3. 3+2=5, but column3+2=5. So that's row5, column5. But the value is 1. So maybe the value decreases by 1 each step. So 2 becomes 1, then 0. So in row5, column5, it's 1. Then maybe the 1 in row4, column4 would create a 0 in row5, column5. But there's already a 1 there. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each number N is copied down N times, with each copy's value decreasing by 1. So a 2 in row3 would create 1 in row4 and 0 in row5 (but 0 is not shown). But in Example0's output, there's a 1 in row4's column4, which matches the 1 in the input. So perhaps this isn't the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in the positions where new numbers are added.\n\nLooking at Example0's input and output:\n\nOriginal 2 at (3,3) (assuming rows and columns are 0-indexed). In the output, new 2 appears at (8,7). The difference is rows +5, columns +4. Not sure.\n\nIn Example1, the input's 3 at (2,6) in row2, column6. In the output, there's a 3 at row2, column6, and new 4s around. So maybe for each non-zero cell, we add a cross of (value+1) around it. So 3 becomes 4s in up, down, left, right. But in Example0, the 2 would become 3s, but in the output, there are 1s added. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the cross added is of the same value. For 3, add 3s around. But in Example1's output, it's 4s around the 3. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers in the output are a combination of the original and the added numbers. For example, if there's a 3 in the input, and the added cells are 4, maybe it's adding 1 to the value in adjacent cells. So for each non-zero cell, add 1 to the adjacent cells. But in Example0's input, the 2 would add 1 to adjacent cells, turning them into 1 (if they were 0). But in the output, the cells around 2 are 1s. That fits. Then the 1s in the input would add 0 to adjacent cells (since 1-1=0?), but in Example0, the 1s have adjacent 1s in the output. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, when a cell has value N, set the four adjacent cells to N. For example, a 2 would turn adjacent cells into 2. But in Example0's input, the 2 is at (3,3). The output's (3,3) remains 2, but adjacent cells are 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: the output could be the input plus some kind of shadow or reflection. For example, in Example0, the original cluster of 2 and 1 is mirrored below. The new cluster is added a few rows down. The distance between the original and mirrored cluster is 5 rows (from row3 to row8). Maybe it's mirroring the original pattern around the middle row.\n\nThe middle row is row6 (since there are 13 rows, 0-12). The original cluster is at row3. The mirrored position would be row9 (since 6 +3=9). In Example0's output, the new cluster starts at row8. Close but not exact. Maybe it's mirrored across the middle. The distance from row3 to middle row6 is 3 rows. The mirror would be row6 +3=9. But in the output, the new 2 is at row8, which is 2 rows above row9. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each number N causes a copy N rows below. For example, a 2 in row3 would create a copy in row3+2=5. Then, a 1 in row4 would copy to row5. But in Example0's output, row5 has a 1 in column5. Original 2 is at row3, column3. So 3+2=5, 3+2=5. So row5, column5. That matches. And the 1 in row4, column4 would copy to row5, column5. But in the output, row5, column5 has a 1. So maybe the copies overwrite existing cells. But there's also a 1 in the input at row4, column4 which copies to row5, column5. But the input's row5, column5 is 0, so the copy becomes 1. This seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern could be: for each cell (i,j) with value N, set the cell (i+N, j+N) to N-1. If that's the case:\n\nIn Example0's 2 at (3,3), N=2. So i+N=5, j+N=5. So (5,5) becomes 1 (2-1). Which matches the output's row5, column5 being 1.\n\nIn Example1, the 3 at (2,6). N=3. i+3=5, j+3=9. So (5,9) would be set to 2 (3-1). But looking at Example1's output, row5, column9 is 0. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the new cell is (i + N, j) or (i, j + N). Let's see:\n\nExample0's 2 at (3,3). Adding N=2 rows: 3+2=5, same column. Output's row5, column5 has 1. Not same column. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the new cell is (i + N, j + N). For N=2, (5,5) becomes 1. Which matches Example0. For Example1's 3 at (2,6), (2+3,6+3)=(5,9) would become 2. But in the output, row5, column9 is 0. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, the new cell is (i, j) shifted down by N rows. For N=2, row3+2=5. Column remains the same. In Example0's output, row5, column5 is 1. Original column was3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Maybe another way: the output is the input with each number replaced by a pattern based on its value. For example, 1 becomes a cross of 1s, 2 becomes a 2x2 square, etc. But in Example0, the 2 and 1 form a small cluster which expands into a larger one. It's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero cell generates a new cell below it. For instance, in Example0, the 2 in row3, column3 generates a 1 in row4, column3. The 1s generate more 1s below. But this doesn't explain all changes.\n\nAnother observation: in the outputs, the original numbers are still present, and new numbers are added around or below them. So the transformation isn't moving the numbers but adding new ones.\n\nLooking at Example3's input and output. The input has a 3 in row9, column4. The output has a cross of 1s and a 3 in row9, column4. Maybe the 3 generates a cross of 1s (3-2=1). So each number N generates a cross of (N-2) around it. For N=3: 1s. For N=4: 2s. But in Example1's input, the 3 generates 4s. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each number N generates a cross of N+1. 3 would generate 4s, which matches Example1. 2 would generate 3s, but in Example0's output, there are 1s around 2. So that's a contradiction.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to summarize the common changes across all examples:\n\n- Non-zero cells in the input lead to new cells being added around or below them in the output.\n- The added cells often form a cross or diamond shape.\n- The value of the new cells seems related to the original cell's value, but the exact relation varies.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe test input has:\n\nRow1: 1 at column2\nRow2: 1,2 at columns1-2\nRow5: 8s at columns8-10\nRow6: 3 at column9, 8 at column10\nRow9: 2 at column3\nRow10: 3 at column7\n\nIf the pattern is that each non-zero cell N generates a cross of (N-1) around it (up, down, left, right), then:\n\nThe 1s would generate 0s (which are not displayed). The 2 would generate 1s around it. The 3 generates 2s. The 8s generate 7s.\n\nBut in Example1's input, the 3 generates 4s. Which would be N+1. So maybe it's N+1.\n\nAlternatively, the cross is made of the same number. For example, a 3 would generate 3s around it. But in Example1, the 3 is surrounded by 4s. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, it's a different number based on some other rule. For example, even numbers generate something, odds generate something else. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each number N adds a diamond-shaped pattern of numbers N-1 around it, but I'm not sure.\n\nIn the test input, the 3 in row1, column5 would generate 2s around it. The 8s in row5 would generate 7s around them. But the output would have these new numbers.\n\nBut given that the examples have varying behaviors, perhaps the actual pattern is that each non-zero cell creates a diamond shape below it. For example, the 2 in Example0's input creates a 1 below and to the sides. The 3 in Example1 creates a 4 cross. The 8 in Example2's input creates 8s in adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of all the inputs' non-zero cells generating their own patterns, which may overlap.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Looking at Example1's input and output, the 3 in row2, column6 leads to a cross of 4s in the output around it. The 4 in row2, column5 (input) leads to 4s around it. Maybe the rule is that each non-zero cell N generates a cross of N+1 around it. So:\n\nFor N=3, generate 4s.\nFor N=4, generate 5s.\nBut in Example0's input, the 2 would generate 3s. But the output has 1s. This doesn't fit. So this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the cross is the same number as the original. For N=3, generate 3s. But Example1's output has 4s. So no.\n\nAnother possible pattern is that each non-zero cell in the input is duplicated in the output at a position shifted right by the cell's value and down by the cell's value. For example, a 2 would shift 2 right and 2 down. So cell (i,j) becomes (i+2,j+2) in the output, and the value is decreased by 1. For Example0's 2 at (3,3), this would create a 1 at (5,5), which is present. The 1s in the input would shift 1 down and right, creating 0s (not displayed). This fits Example0. For Example1's 3 at (2,6), it would create a 2 at (5,9). But in Example1's output, there's a 3 at (2,6) and new 4s around. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the shifted cell's value is the same as the original. So a 2 would be copied to (3+2,3+2)=(5,5) as 2. But in Example0's output, (5,5) is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed to hypothesize that the pattern is that each non-zero cell N generates a cross (up, down, left, right) of N+1 in the output, and this is added to the existing input. For example, a 3 would create 4s around it, and those are added to the output. Let's test this hypothesis against the examples:\n\nExample1's input has a 3 at (2,6). The output around it has 4s. This fits. The 4s in the input would generate 5s around them. But looking at Example1's output, the 4s are still present and have 4s around them. For example, the 4 in row2, column5 (input) is surrounded by 4s in the output. So if the rule is to add N+1 around, then 4 would generate 5s. But the output has 4s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the cross is N-1. For a 3, generate 2s around. But in Example1's output, it's 4s. Doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that this is not working, perhaps the actual pattern is that each non-zero cell in the input is surrounded by cells of the same value in the output. For example, a 3 in the input would have 3s around it in the output. But Example1's output has 4s around the 3. So this can't be.\n\nAt this point, I think the pattern might be that each non-zero cell in the input generates a cross of its value in the output, but shifted down and to the right by N cells. For example, a 2 in (i,j) would generate a cross at (i+2,j+2). The value of these new cells would be 2. But in Example0's output, the new 1s are present. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the shifted cells' value is one less. For example, a 2 in (i,j) would generate a cross of 1s at (i+2,j+2). This would fit Example0's new 1s. Then, in Example1's input, the 3 would generate a cross of 2s at (i+3,j+3). But in Example1's output, the new cells are 4s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really frustrating. Let's look at the test input and try to see what the expected output might be, based on the examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow1: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow2: [0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\nRow6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0]\n\nRow7: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow9: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow10: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps for each number N in the input, we add a cross of N's in the output at a certain distance. For example, in Example3, the 3 in row9, column4 generates a cross of 1s in row9, columns3-5, and row8-10, column4.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the output might be generated by applying a convolution or kernel where each non-zero cell spreads its value to neighboring cells in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the input plus a reflection across the vertical axis. For example, elements on the left are mirrored to the right. But in the examples, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each number N in the input causes a cross of N's to be added in the output, but shifted down by N rows. For example, a 3 in row1 would add a cross of 3s in row1+3=4. But in the test input, the 3 is in row1, column5. Adding a cross in row4, column5. So output row4 would have 3s around column5. But in the test input's row4 is all zeros. The output might have 3s added there.\n\nBut without knowing the exact rule, it's hard to say. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed to make a guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the examples, especially Example1 and Example3, it seems like non-zero numbers generate a cross of the same number below them. For example, a 3 in the input generates a cross of 3s below. But in Example1's output, the cross around the 3 is 4s, which complicates this.\n\nAlternatively, the generated cross has numbers one higher than the original. So a 3 would generate 4s. This fits Example1, where the 3 generates 4s around it. In Example3, a 1 generates 2s, but the output has 1s. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach for the test input:\n\nFor each non-zero cell in the input, create a cross of the same value below and to the sides. For example, the 3 in row1, column5 would generate 3s in the adjacent cells below and to the sides. The 2 in row9, column3 would generate 2s around it. The 8s would generate 8s around them.\n\nBut according to Example2's input, the 8s generate 4s and 8s. For instance, the 8s in row2 generate 4s in the output. So maybe the value decreases by 4. But this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, each number N generates a cross of N-4. For 8, 8-4=4. In Example2's output, the 8s generate 4s. This fits. For Example1's 3, 3-4= -1, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps this isn't the case.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to make a best guess. Based on Example2, where 8s generate 4s, and 3 generates 8s, perhaps each number is divided by 2 (rounded down). 8/2=4, 3/2=1.5 but becomes 8. Hmm, not.\n\nAlternatively, each number N generates a cross of N-4. 8-4=4, 3-4= -1 (but in Example1, 3 generates 4s). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'll have to give up and make a educated guess based on the examples. Looking at the test input's 8s in row5 and row6, perhaps they generate 4s around them. The 3 in row6, column9 might generate a cross of 4s. The 2 in row9, column3 would generate 1s around it. The 3 in row10, column7 would generate 4s around it. The 1s in rows2 and 3 might generate 0s, which are not displayed. \n\nBased on this, the test output would have:\n\n- Around row5's 8s: generate 4s in adjacent cells.\n- Around row6's 3: generate 4s.\n- Around row9's 2: generate 1s.\n- Around row10's 3: generate 4s.\n- The 1s in rows1-3 might generate nothing.\n\nBut this is just a guess. The actual pattern might be different, but given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.",
