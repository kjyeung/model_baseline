        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input seems to have some numbers arranged in a grid, and the output modifies those numbers in a certain way. Let's start by analyzing the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has a section with 8s forming a sort of square (maybe a 3x3 square with a hole in the middle) and some 3s below it. The output for the 8s seems to spread the 3s to the right in a repeating pattern. Like, the original 3 in row 6, column 10 (0-indexed?) becomes multiple 3s in the same row. Also, the 2s in the input (row 10) turn into more 2s below them in the output, creating similar patterns. So maybe each number is being replicated in a specific direction or pattern based on their position.\n\nExample 1 has a 4 in the input and some 1s and 2s. The output creates a diamond-like pattern around the 4 and 1s. The 4s are arranged in a plus shape, and the 2s form a sort of cross as well. It looks like numbers are expanding into their neighboring cells, maybe in a cross or diamond pattern depending on the number.\n\nExample 2 has 6s and 5s. The 6s in the input are spread into a diagonal or triangular pattern in the output. The 1s also form similar patterns. So perhaps each number has a specific direction or shape it propagates. For example, 6 might spread diagonally, while 1s form a triangle.\n\nNow, looking at the test input. There's a 4 in rows 4 and 5, column 10. Then in rows 7-9, there are 8s forming a square with a hole (like in Example 0), and a 2 in column 10. Below that, there's a row with 3s. \n\nFollowing Example 0's pattern, the 8s might cause the 2s (or another number) to spread to the right. But in the test input, the 2 is in column 10, so maybe the 2s will replicate to the right in triplets, like 3s did in Example 0. The 4s in rows 4 and 5 could form a diamond or cross pattern as in Example 1. Also, the 3s in row 11 might form a pattern similar to the 2s in Example 0, creating more 3s to the right or in some other direction.\n\nPutting it all together: Each number in the input generates a specific pattern. For example, 8s create a square and cause the number to their right (like 3 or 2) to replicate in triplets to the right. Numbers like 4 might form a cross. The 3s in the test input's row 11 would then generate their own pattern, possibly replicating to the right as triplets. The 4s in rows 4-5 might create a diamond or cross around them. The 8s might stay the same but affect the 2s, causing them to spread.\n\nSo the output should have the 8s in their original position, the 2s in column 10 (from rows 7-9) would spread to the right as triplets (like 3s did in Example 0). The 4s would form a cross pattern around their positions. The 3s in row 11 would also spread to the right in triplets. Let me try to visualize that and check if it aligns with the examples.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I've got these three training examples, each with an input and output grid. The test input is similar, so I need to see how the input is transformed into the output in the examples and apply that to the test case.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some 8s forming a square (maybe a 3x3 square with the center missing) in rows 6-8, and a 3 in column 10. The output for those rows expands the 3s into multiple 3x3 squares to the right. Also, the 2s in row 10 turn into a similar pattern but repeated below. So it looks like whenever there's a number, it's creating a 3x3 block of that number, possibly repeating it in some direction. But in the output, the original 8s are still there, but the 3s and 2s have generated their own patterns. Maybe each number is creating a stamp of itself in a certain direction, like right or down?\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has a 4 in row 5, column 12, and a 1 in row 7, column 12, and a 2 in row 8, column 9. The output creates diamond shapes (like 4s forming a cross) around those numbers. For example, around the 4, there are 4s in a cross pattern. The 2 and 1 also form crosses. So maybe each number is creating a cross (like a plus sign) of its own number around it. But in the output, there are multiple crosses for the same number. For instance, the 4s in the output are in a diamond shape around the original 4. Wait, but the 4 in the input is at (5,12), and the output has a cross of 4s around it. Then, further to the right, there's another 4 cross. So maybe it's replicating the cross pattern in a certain direction, maybe to the right or down?\n\nExample 2 has a 6 in row 4 and 5, and some 5s and 1s. The output for the 6s creates a diamond pattern spreading out. The 1s in the input (rows 11-12) become diamond patterns as well. The 5s in the input form their own patterns, maybe unchanged. So again, it's like numbers are generating crosses or diamonds of their own number, possibly in multiple directions.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern seems to be that each non-zero number in the input creates a 3x3 cross (like a plus sign, where the center is the original number, and the cross is the same number) around its position. Then, these crosses are repeated in some direction, perhaps to the right or down, depending on the original number's position or value. Alternatively, the number might be causing its own pattern to be replicated multiple times in a certain direction.\n\nLooking at the test input: there's a 4 in row 4 and 5, column 10. Then, in rows 7-9, there's an 8's pattern (3x3 square with center missing) and a 2 in column 10. Then in row 11, there are 3s. The output should replicate the crosses based on these numbers. For example, the 4s might generate crosses around them. The 8s in the input are already forming a square, but perhaps the 2 and 3s will generate their own patterns. \n\nWait, in Example 0, the 3 in column 10, row 6, becomes a series of 3x3 blocks to the right. Similarly, the 2 in row 10 also generates 3x3 blocks below. So maybe each number generates a 3x3 block (like the cross) of itself, and then repeats that pattern in a specific direction. The direction might be determined by the number's value or position. For instance, in Example 0, the 3 is followed by 3s to the right, and the 2s are followed by 2s below. So perhaps even numbers replicate to the right, and odd numbers replicate downward? Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0, the 3 (which is odd) in row 6, column 10. The output has the 3's cross (3s in a plus shape) repeated to the right. Then the 2 (even) in row 10, column 6. The output for the 2's cross is replicated downward. So maybe even numbers replicate downward, and odd numbers replicate to the right? Or maybe the direction is determined by the number's parity. Let's see Example 1: the input has a 4 (even), which in the output has crosses replicated to the right. The 1 (odd) has crosses replicated downward? Or perhaps the number of repetitions is related to the number's value.\n\nAlternatively, the direction could be determined by the row. For example, numbers in certain rows spread in certain directions. But that might be more complex. Let's look at the examples again.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 3 is in column 10, row 6. The output shows the 3's cross in row 6, columns 10-12 (the cross is 3s), then again starting at column 14, 16, etc. So it's repeated every 3 columns. Similarly, the 2 in row 10, column 6-8 becomes a cross in the same row, then below in rows 11 and 12. So for the 3, it's spreading to the right; for the 2, it's spreading downward.\n\nBut why? The 3 is in row 6, and the 2 is in row 10. Maybe the direction is determined by the row's parity. Let's see: 6 is even, 10 is even. So that might not be it. Alternatively, the number itself: 3 is odd, so right; 2 is even, so down. Let's check Example 1. The input has 4 (even) in row 5, column 12. The output shows 4s forming a cross to the right. The 1 (odd) in row 7, column 12. The output shows 1s forming a cross downward. Wait, but in Example 1's output, the 4's crosses are in the same row but spread to the right. The 1's cross is in the same column but spread downward. So maybe even numbers spread to the right, odd numbers spread downward. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, 3 (odd) would spread downward, but in the output, the 3's crosses are in the same row, spread to the right. Hmm, that contradicts. Alternatively, perhaps the number's parity determines the direction. Wait, 3 is odd. In Example 0, the 3's crosses are repeated to the right. So maybe the parity doesn't determine direction. Maybe the direction is fixed: all numbers spread to the right. But in Example 0's 2, which is even, the crosses are spread downward. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number's cross is generated in the same spot, and then the entire pattern is duplicated multiple times. But how? Let me look at the outputs again.\n\nIn Example 0, the output for the 3 in row 6, column 10 is a cross (3s in row 6, columns 10-12, and column 10 in rows 5-7?), but looking at the output:\n\nOriginal 3 is in row 6, column 10. The output has 3s in row 6, columns 10-12 (so a horizontal line?), and then in columns 14, 16, etc. Wait, looking at the output rows for 3:\n\nIn Example 0's output, row 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8,8,8,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,3]. So the original 3 is at index 10. Then starting at 10, there's 3,3,3 (columns 10,11,12). Then after a zero, another 3,3,3 (14,15,16?), then again at 18,19,20. So each group is three 3s, spaced by zeros. So perhaps the 3's cross is a horizontal line of three 3s, and this pattern is repeated every four columns? Or maybe the 3's cross is a horizontal line, and it's repeated to the right three times, each separated by a zero. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero number in the input creates a 3x3 cross (horizontal and vertical) of the same number around it. Then, this cross is repeated multiple times in a certain direction. The number of repetitions could be equal to the number's value. For example, a 3 would repeat three times, but that's not exactly what's happening here.\n\nAlternatively, the output is creating a pattern where each number's cross is placed at intervals. For instance, in Example 0, the 3's cross is placed every three columns. Let's see:\n\nOriginal 3 is at column 10. The output for row 6 has 3s at 10,11,12 (the cross), then 14,15,16 (another cross), 18,19,20 (another). So each cross is followed by a zero and then the next cross. The spacing between them is one zero. So maybe each cross is followed by a gap and then another, repeating to the end of the row. Similarly, the 2 in row 10 has a cross (columns 6-8), then in rows 11 and 12, the same pattern, but each cross is below the previous one, separated by a zero row.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each non-zero number in the input, create a 3x3 cross (a horizontal line of three and a vertical line of three) centered at that number's position. Then, replicate that cross multiple times in a specific direction. The direction might be right for some numbers and down for others.\n\nBut how is the direction determined? Let's look at the examples:\n\nIn Example 0, the 3 is at (6,10). The output's crosses for 3 are to the right. The 2 is at (10,6), and the crosses are downward. Maybe the direction is determined by the row or column. For example, if the original number is in an even row, spread to the right; if in an odd row, spread downward. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, the 3 is in row 6 (even), so spread to the right. The 2 is in row 10 (even), but in the output, the crosses are downward. Hmm, that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the direction could be determined by the number's value. For even numbers, spread to the right; for odd, down. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, 3 is odd. If spread direction is down, but in the example, the 3's crosses are spread to the right. So that's not matching. Alternatively, the opposite: even numbers spread down, odd to the right. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, 3 is odd, so spread to the right. That matches. The 2 is even, so spread down. That matches. In Example 1, the 4 (even) is spread down? Let's see. The original 4 is at (5,12). The output has 4's crosses to the right. So 4 is even but spread to the right. That contradicts the previous idea. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the number's position. For instance, if the number is in the left half of the grid, spread to the right; if in the right half, spread down. Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has 4 at (5,12). The output has multiple 4 crosses to the right. So perhaps the direction is always to the right for all numbers. But in Example 0, the 2's crosses are spread downward. So that can't be.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs for each example:\n\nIn Example 0, the 3 in the input causes three horizontal stripes (each 3,3,3) to the right. Each stripe is separated by a zero. The 2 in the input causes vertical stripes downward (each 2,2,2 in a column). So for 3, horizontal replication; for 2, vertical.\n\nBut why? 3 is odd and 2 is even. So parity determines direction: even numbers replicate vertically, odd replicate horizontally. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the 4 (even) would replicate vertically. But in the output, the 4's are arranged in crosses that are spread horizontally. Wait, no. The output for the 4 in Example 1 shows crosses in a diamond pattern spread horizontally. Wait, the input's 4 is at (5,12). The output has 4s forming crosses at (0,11-13), (4,10-14), etc. Maybe it's a cross that's replicated in both directions? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number's cross is placed to the right and down based on some rule. This is getting complicated.\n\nLet's look at another approach. The output for Example 0's 3 is that the original 3's cross (three 3s in a row) is followed by more 3s in the same row, spaced out. The 2's cross is three 2s in a column, then more below. So the direction of replication is based on the orientation of the cross. If the cross is horizontal, replicate horizontally; if vertical, replicate vertically. But how is the cross orientation determined?\n\nWait, maybe the cross is a horizontal line of three for even numbers and a vertical line for odd numbers. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- 3 (odd) has a horizontal cross (three 3s in a row) in the output. Then replicated to the right.\n- 2 (even) has a vertical cross (three 2s in a column) in the output, then replicated downward.\n\nBut that doesn't fit the parity idea. Wait, 3 is odd but the cross is horizontal, and 2 even cross is vertical. So maybe even numbers create vertical crosses and replicate downward, while odd numbers create horizontal crosses and replicate to the right.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\n- The 4 (even) in the input. The output's 4 crosses are vertical (like three 4s in a column?), but looking at the output:\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 4's cross is a vertical line. For example, row 0, columns 11-13 have 4s. Wait, no. Looking at the first few rows of Example 1's output:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 horizontal line of three 4s.\n\nBut the original 4 was at (5,12). So the output has a horizontal line of 4s in row 0, columns 11-13. That's a horizontal cross. So 4 is even but the cross is horizontal. That contradicts the previous idea. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross is always horizontal, regardless of parity. Then, the replication direction is determined by something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross is a 3x3 square where the middle is the original number, and surrounding cells are the same number. Wait, no. Looking at Example 0's 3: in the input, there's a single 3. In the output, row 6, columns 10-12 are all 3s. So that's a horizontal line. Then in rows 7, columns 10, 12 are 3s (middle missing). Then row 8, columns 10-12 again. So the cross is a 3x3 square with the center as the original 3. Wait, but that's not a cross, it's a square. Wait, the output for the 3 in Example 0:\n\nRow 6: [..., 8,8,8,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,3]\n\nRow 7: [...,8,0,8,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,3]\n\nRow 8: [...,8,8,8,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,3]\n\nAh, so the 3 is forming a 3x3 square with the center missing. Wait, no. Wait, rows 6-8 for column 10-12: in row 6, 3,3,3; row7, 3,0,3; row8,3,3,3. That's a hollow square. Wait, no, it's a filled square except the center. Wait, that's like the 8 pattern in the input. So maybe the pattern for each number is to create a 3x3 square with the center being the original number, and then replicate that pattern multiple times in some direction.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, the 8s form a filled square (three rows of 8,8,8, then 8,0,8, then 8,8,8). So their output is the same, but the 3 and 2 numbers are generating their own squares. Wait, but the output's 3s are arranged in multiple 3x3 squares to the right. So perhaps each non-zero number in the input generates a 3x3 square (hollow or filled?) in the output, and then this square is repeated multiple times in a certain direction.\n\nIn Example 0's 3: the original 3 is at (6,10). The output creates a 3x3 square (filled?) starting at (6,10), then repeats this pattern every 4 columns (since between the first 3,3,3 and the next there's a 0). So the first square is columns 10-12, then after a 0 (column 13), another square at 14-16, then another at 18-20. Similarly, for the 2 in row 10, column 6-8, the output creates a 3x3 square and repeats it downward every 4 rows. So the direction of replication is right for 3 and down for 2. \n\nBut why? How is the direction determined? Maybe the direction is based on the number's value modulo something, like even/odd. 3 is odd, so replicate to the right; 2 is even, replicate down. Let's check Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 4 (even) at (5,12). The output creates a 3x3 square of 4s around it. Looking at the output rows 0 and 4:\n\nRow 0: ...0,0,4,4,4,0,0...\nRow 1: ...0,0,0,4,0,0...\nRow 4: ...0,0,4,4,4,0,0...\n\nSo the 4's square is replicated in rows 0,4, and others. This suggests vertical replication. But the 4 is even, so perhaps even numbers replicate downward. But in Example 0, 2 (even) replicates downward. So maybe even numbers replicate downward, odd to the right.\n\nSo applying this to the test input: the numbers are 4 (even), 8 (even), 2 (even), and 3 (odd). So 4 should replicate downward, 8 replicate down, 2 down, 3 replicate right.\n\nBut wait, the test input has:\n\nRows 7-9 have 8s forming a square (8,8,8; 8,0,8; 8,0,8). Wait, the input for test is:\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,2,0,...]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,2,0,...]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,2,0,...]\n\nSo the 8's pattern is a filled square in rows 7-9, columns 6-8 (original 8s in rows 7-9, columns 6,7,8). Then in the output, this pattern might be replicated to the right if 8 is even. But in Example 0's 8s were part of the input and their output didn't change. Wait, in Example 0's input, the 8s were already in a square, and the output didn't change them but added the 3s and 2s. So perhaps the existing 8s are left as-is, and the other numbers generate their patterns. So for the test input, the existing 8s would stay, and the other numbers (4, 2, 3) would generate their patterns.\n\nThe 4s in test input are in rows 4 and 5, column 10. Both are even rows. Since 4 is even, they should replicate downward. So each 4 would generate a 3x3 square below them. But looking at Example 1's 4, which was even and replicated downward. But in Example 1's output, the 4's square was replicated in multiple rows. So for the test input's 4s at (4,10) and (5,10), they would each generate squares downward.\n\nThe 2 in row 7,8,9, column 10. 2 is even, so replicate downward. The 3 in row 11, columns 6-8. 3 is odd, so replicate to the right.\n\nLet's try to apply this.\n\nFor the 4s in rows 4 and 5, column 10:\n\nEach 4 would generate a 3x3 square. So for row4, column10, the square would be:\n\nRow4-6, columns 9-11? Or centered at 10. For a 3x3 square centered at (4,10):\n\nRows 3-5, columns 9-11. But the input has 4 in row4 and 5, column10. Hmm, maybe each 4 creates a square around it. But since there are two 4s in adjacent rows, their squares may overlap.\n\nAlternatively, the 3x3 square for each number is placed such that the original number is the center. Then, replicate this square downward (for even numbers).\n\nFor example, the 4 at (4,10) would generate a square:\n\nRows 3-5, columns 9-11. But the input's 4 is at row4, so the square would cover rows 3-5, columns 9-11. Then replicated downward every 3 rows. So next square would be rows 6-8, then 9-11, etc.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's look at the test input's structure.\n\nTest input's 4s are in row4 and row5, column10. Since they are even numbers, perhaps each creates a 3x3 square (filled or hollow) centered at their position and replicated downward. So the first 4's square would be in rows 3-5, columns9-11. But since row5 has another 4, perhaps they interfere. Alternatively, the replication is such that each number's square is placed, and then copied multiple times downward.\n\nThe test output should have the original 8's pattern unchanged, and the 4s, 2, and 3 generating their own squares replicated in the respective directions.\n\nThe 3 in row11, columns6-8 (assuming the input's 3 is in row11, columns6-8: [3,3,3]). The output would generate a 3x3 square for each 3. Since 3 is odd, the squares are replicated to the right. So each 3 in the input's row11 would create a square to the right.\n\nPutting all together, the test output would have:\n\nFor the 4s in rows4 and5, column10: each generates a 3x3 square (filled?) downward. So starting at row4, column10, the square would be:\n\nRow4: 4 in column10, possibly with surrounding 4s. But since it's a square, maybe:\n\nRow3, column9-11: 4,4,4\n\nRow4, column9-11:4,4,4\n\nRow5, column9-11:4,4,4\n\nBut the input already has 4s in row4 and 5, column10. So the output would expand these into full 3x3 squares. Then replicate them downward.\n\nSimilarly, the 2 in rows7-9, column10 (each row has 2 in column10). Since 2 is even, each generates a 3x3 square downward. So each 2 creates a square below it, replicated downward.\n\nThe 3 in row11, columns6-8 is a horizontal line of 3s. As an odd number, this would replicate to the right, creating more horizontal lines of 3s.\n\nPutting this all together, the output for the test input would have:\n\n- The original 8s remain as-is.\n\n- The 4s in rows4 and5, column10 generate 3x3 squares downward. So starting from their positions, there would be 4's squares below them, possibly overlapping.\n\n- The 2s in rows7-9, column10 generate squares downward.\n\n- The 3s in row11 generate squares to the right.\n\nBut this is speculative. Looking at the examples again, perhaps the transformation is to take each non-zero number and create a 3x3 cross (like a plus sign) centered on it, then repeat that pattern in the direction determined by the number's parity. For even numbers, replicate downward; for odd, to the right.\n\nIn the test input:\n\n- The 4s (even) create a cross and replicate downward. So each 4's cross would generate crosses below it.\n\n- The 8s are even, but they already form a cross (the input's 8s are a 3x3 square with the center missing). So their output may stay the same, but no replication since they're already part of a larger structure.\n\n- The 2s (even) in column10 create crosses and replicate downward.\n\n- The 3s (odd) create crosses and replicate to the right.\n\nSo for the test input's 4s at rows4 and5, column10:\n\nEach 4's cross would be a plus sign (3x3 cross). Then, replicated downward every 3 rows. So in the output, there would be multiple crosses of 4s below them.\n\nThe 2s in rows7-9, column10: each generates a cross below. Since they're in consecutive rows, their crosses would stack.\n\nThe 3s in row11, columns6-8: each generates a cross to the right, leading to multiple crosses extending to the right.\n\nPutting this together, the output for the test input would look like:\n\n- The 8's original pattern remains.\n\n- For the 4s in rows4 and5, column10:\n\nEach 4's cross would be rows3-5, columns9-11 (vertical) and row4, columns9-11 (horizontal). Then replicated downward. So there might be crosses at rows4,5,6... etc.\n\nBut this is getting complex. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that each number generates a 3x3 cross (plus sign) and replicates it in the direction based on parity (even: down, odd: right). Then apply this to the test input.\n\nSo for each 4 (even) in the test input, create a cross and replicate downward. The 2s (even) create crosses and replicate down. The 3s (odd) create crosses and replicate right.\n\nThe final answer would then be the test input's original 8s plus the generated patterns for 4,2,3 as described.",
