        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, there are these input and output pairs, and I need to find the pattern that transforms the input into the output. Then apply that to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples closely.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 0. The input has four lists, each of length 14. The output is a list of four elements. Let's see each input list to their corresponding output elements.\n\nTake the first input list in Example 0:\n[0, 4, 0, 4, 2, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThe output is [9,4,0,4]. Hmm, how does that relate? Let me check the positions. Maybe the numbers are taken from specific positions. Let's see: the input list has elements from index 0 to 13. The output has four elements, maybe each comes from a different position in the input list.\n\nLooking at the first output element 9: in the input list, the numbers at indices 5 and 6 are 9. Maybe the first output is the first occurrence of a 9? But wait, the input list's fifth element (index 5) is 9. So maybe the first output element is the element at index 5? Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 0's second input list:\n[0,4,0,0,2,0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0]\nOutput is [0,4,9,9]. The first output element here is 0. In the input list, index 5 is 0. So if the first output element is index 5, then here it's 0, which matches. Then the second output element is 4. Let's check index 1 in the input list, which is 4. So maybe the second output element is index 1. Then the third element in output is 9, which in the input list is at indices 7 and 8. Maybe index 7? Then the fourth element is 9 again, index 8? Let's check.\n\nSo first output element: index 5\nSecond: index 1\nThird: index 7\nFourth: index 8?\n\nWait, let's test this. For the first input in Example 0, output is [9,4,0,4]. Wait, index 5 is 9 (yes), index 1 is 4 (yes). Then index 7 is 0, but the third element in output is 0. Then index 8 is 0, but the fourth element is 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe not those indices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking for positions after a certain marker. The input lists all start with numbers followed by 2, then some numbers, then 2 again. Wait, looking at Example 0's first input list: the elements are [0,4,0,4,2,9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. The 2 is at index 4 and 9. So the list is split into parts separated by 2s? Like the first part is [0,4,0,4], then after the 2 at index4 comes [9,9,0,0], then after the next 2 at index9, the rest is [0,0,0,0]. Maybe the output is derived from these parts.\n\nSo maybe the input list is divided into three segments separated by 2s. For example, first segment is elements before the first 2 (indices 0-3), then between the two 2s (indices5-8?), and then after the second 2 (indices10-13). Wait, but in the first input list, the 2 is at index4 and 9. So elements before index4: indices0-4? Wait index4 is 2, so before is indices0-3 (elements 0,4,0,4). Then between index4 and 9 (indices5-8: 9,9,0,0). Then after index9 (indices10-13: 0,0,0,0).\n\nIf the output is formed by taking the first element of each segment? Let's see. The first segment is [0,4,0,4], so first element is 0. But the first output is 9. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe taking the maximum or sum of each segment. For the first input list, segments are [0,4,0,4], sum is 8, max is4. Then next segment is [9,9,0,0], sum 18, max 9. Then next [0,0,0,0], sum 0. But the output is [9,4,0,4]. Not matching sums or maxes. So maybe that's not it.\n\nWait another approach: looking at the output for Example 0's first input. The output is [9,4,0,4]. The input's elements after the first 2 (which is at index4) are 9,9,0,0,2,... So maybe the first element of the output is the first 9 in the second segment. Then the second element is 4 from the first segment. Then the third and fourth elements? The third part (after the second 2) is all zeros. But the output has 0 and 4. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from specific positions relative to the two 2s. Let's see. The first 2 is at index4, the second at index9. Maybe the positions are:\n\n- The element right after the first 2 (index5: 9)\n- The element before the first 2 (index3:4)\n- The element right after the second 2 (index10:0)\n- The element before the second 2 (index8:0)\nBut then the output would be [9,4,0,0], which doesn't match the first example's output [9,4,0,4]. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two 2s are markers, and between them are some elements that contribute to the output. Let's see the first example's input again. Between the two 2s (indices5-8) are [9,9,0,0]. The output has 9,4,0,4. The first 9 is from the first element here. Then the 4 is from before the first 2. The third 0 is from after the second 2. Hmm, but then the fourth element 4 is from before the first 2 again? Maybe not.\n\nWait maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the four positions: index5, index1, index10, index3. Let's check:\n\nFor the first input in Example 0:\n\nindex5:9, index1:4, index10:0, index3:4 \u2192 [9,4,0,4], which matches the output. Let's check if this holds for other examples.\n\nTake Example 0's second input list:\n\n[0,4,0,0,2,0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0]\n\nindices5 is 0, index1 is4, index10 is0, index3 is0 \u2192 output is [0,4,0,0], but the actual output is [0,4,9,9]. So that doesn't match. So maybe this theory is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe indexes 5, 1, 7, 8. Let's check first example's input:\n\nindex5:9, index1:4, index7:0, index8:0 \u2192 [9,4,0,0], but output is [9,4,0,4]. So no. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 1's first input:\n\nInput: [4,4,4,4,2,9,0,9,0,2,0,0,0,1]\n\nOutput: [4,4,4,4]\n\nSo the output is all 4s. If I consider indexes 5,1,7,8: 9,4,9,0 \u2192 which is [9,4,9,0], which doesn't match. So that's not right.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is made by taking the first occurrence of each unique number in a certain part of the input. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs for all examples. The outputs are all lists of four elements. Each element is either 9,4,0,1, etc. The inputs have 2s in positions 4 and 9. Let's see:\n\nEach input list has a 2 at position 4 and 9 (assuming the input lists are all 14 elements long). So the structure is:\n\nFirst part: elements 0-3 (before first 2)\nSecond part: elements 5-8 (between the two 2s)\nThird part: elements 10-13 (after second 2)\n\nMaybe the output is constructed from the second part (elements 5-8) and the first part's elements. Let's see Example 0:\n\nFirst input's second part is [9,9,0,0], so perhaps the output is taking the first two elements of the second part (9,9) and the first two elements of the first part (0,4) \u2192 but output is [9,4,0,4]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the output is from a different part. Like first element from second part, second from first part, third from third part, fourth from first part again. For Example 0's first input:\n\nSecond part [9,9,0,0] \u2192 first element 9. First part [0,4,0,4] \u2192 second element 4. Third part [0,0,0,0] \u2192 third element 0. Then first part again fourth element 4. So output [9,4,0,4], which matches. Let's check if this holds for other examples.\n\nTake Example 0's second input:\n\nFirst part [0,4,0,0], second part [0,0,9,9], third part [0,1,0,0]. Output is [0,4,9,9]. So first element is first of second part (0), second element is second of first part (4). Third element is first of third part (0) \u2192 but output's third is 9. So this doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nHmm, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the second part (indices5-8) and the third part (indices10-13). Let's see. For Example 0's first input, second part is [9,9,0,0], third part is [0,0,0,0]. Output is [9,4,0,4]. So perhaps combining elements from these parts in a different way. Not obvious.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the output for each input list in Example 0. The first output is [9,4,0,4]. The input list's elements at indices 5,1,10,3: 9,4,0,4. That matches exactly. Let's check if this pattern holds for other examples.\n\nExample 0's second input list: [0,4,0,0,2,0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0]. Indices5:0, index1:4, index10:0, index3:0. Output is [0,4,9,9]. But according to this pattern, it would be [0,4,0,0], which doesn't match. So this theory is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the positions are 5, 1, 7, 3. Let's check Example 0's first input: indices5:9, 1:4,7:0,3:4. Output is [9,4,0,4]. So the third element is 0 (index7), fourth is 4 (index3). That matches. Let's check the second input in Example 0.\n\nSecond input list: indices5:0,1:4,7:9,3:0. So [0,4,9,0], but output is [0,4,9,9]. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output elements are indices5, 1, 7, 8. For first input, that's 9,4,0,0 \u2192 output [9,4,0,4]. Not matching. So maybe that's not.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the first occurrence of each number after the first 2. Like, in Example0's first input, after the first 2 (index4), the elements are 9,9,0,0. So the first element of the output is 9, and then maybe looking for the next unique numbers. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the maximum of each segment. For the first input:\n\nFirst segment max is4, second is9, third is0. But output is [9,4,0,4]. So perhaps first and third elements are from the second and third segments, but not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 0's outputs. Each output has four elements, which may correspond to four positions in the input. Let's see:\n\nLooking across all examples to see if there's a pattern in positions.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput lists:\n\n1st input: [0,4,0,4,2,9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0] \u2192 Output [9,4,0,4]\n\nIf we look at positions 5, 1, 10, 3:\n\n5:9, 1:4, 10:0, 3:4 \u2192 which gives [9,4,0,4]. That matches.\n\nCheck if this is consistent for other examples.\n\nSecond input in Example0:\n\n[0,4,0,0,2,0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0]\n\npositions5:0, 1:4,10:0,3:0 \u2192 [0,4,0,0], but output is [0,4,9,9]. So no.\n\nSo this doesn't work. Maybe different positions.\n\nWait maybe the output is formed by taking the 5th, 1st, 7th, and 8th elements. For first input:\n\n5:9,1:4,7:0,8:0 \u2192 [9,4,0,0], output is [9,4,0,4]. So no. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the positions where 9 appears in the input and how it affects the output. In Example0's first input, the output starts with 9. The 9s in the input are at positions5 and6. The output's first element is9. So perhaps the first element of the output is the first occurrence of9 after the first 2. Then the second element could be the first occurrence of4 before the first 2. The third and fourth elements... Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at how the output relates to the input in each example. For instance, in Example0:\n\nInput1: [0,4,0,4,2,9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0] \u2192 Output [9,4,0,4]\n\nLooking at this, maybe the output is [element5, element1, element10, element3]. Because element5 is9, element1 is4, element10 is0, element3 is4. That gives [9,4,0,4], which matches.\n\nLet's check if this holds for other examples.\n\nExample0's second input:\n\n[0,4,0,0,2,0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0]\n\nelement5 is0, element1 is4, element10 is0, element3 is0. So output would be [0,4,0,0]. But the actual output is [0,4,9,9]. So that's different. So this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions are different. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1's first input:\n\nInput: [4,4,4,4,2,9,0,9,0,2,0,0,0,1]\n\nOutput: [4,4,4,4]\n\nIf we take element5 (9), element1 (4), element10 (0), element3 (4), the output would be [9,4,0,4]. But actual output is [4,4,4,4]. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps the output is taking elements from the third segment (after second 2). For example1's input, third segment is [0,0,0,1]. But output is all 4s, which are in the first segment. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: The input lists have two 2s. Let's split each input into three parts:\n\n- Part A: elements before first 2 (indices0-3)\n- Part B: elements between the two 2s (indices5-8)\n- Part C: elements after second 2 (indices10-13)\n\nEach of these parts has four elements.\n\nNow, the output is four elements. Maybe each element of the output is formed by combining elements from these parts in a certain way. For example:\n\nOutput[0] = Part B[0]\n\nOutput[1] = Part A[1]\n\nOutput[2] = Part C[0]\n\nOutput[3] = Part A[3]\n\nLet's test this with Example0's first input:\n\nPart A: [0,4,0,4]\n\nPart B: [9,9,0,0]\n\nPart C: [0,0,0,0]\n\nThen output would be:\n\nB[0] =9, A[1] =4, C[0]=0, A[3]=4 \u2192 [9,4,0,4], which matches the output. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0's second input:\n\nInput: [0,4,0,0,2,0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0]\n\nPart A: [0,4,0,0]\n\nPart B: [0,0,9,9]\n\nPart C: [0,1,0,0]\n\nOutput should be B[0]=0, A[1]=4, C[0]=0, A[3]=0 \u2192 [0,4,0,0]. But actual output is [0,4,9,9]. Doesn't match. So this theory is invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps the third element is part B[2], not part C[0]. Let's try:\n\nOutput[0] = B[0]\n\nOutput[1] = A[1]\n\nOutput[2] = B[3]\n\nOutput[3] = A[3]\n\nFor Example0's first input: B[0]=9, A[1]=4, B[3]=0, A[3]=4 \u2192 [9,4,0,4], which matches.\n\nFor Example0's second input: B[0]=0, A[1]=4, B[3]=9, A[3]=0 \u2192 [0,4,9,0]. But actual output is [0,4,9,9]. So third element is 9, fourth is9. So maybe Output[3] is B[3] instead. Let's see.\n\nSo Output[3] = B[3]. For Example0's second input, B[3] is9. So the output would be [0,4,9,9], which matches. Let's check this pattern:\n\nOutput[0] = B[0]\n\nOutput[1] = A[1]\n\nOutput[2] = B[3]\n\nOutput[3] = B[3] again? No, that would give the fourth element as9 again. Wait, in the second example's output, fourth element is9. Wait no, the output is [0,4,9,9], so the fourth element is9. So according to this pattern, the fourth element would be B[3], which is9. So yes, that matches.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with other examples.\n\nExample1's first input:\n\nInput: [4,4,4,4,2,9,0,9,0,2,0,0,0,1]\n\nPart A: [4,4,4,4]\n\nPart B: [9,0,9,0]\n\nPart C: [0,0,0,1]\n\nOutput should be B[0]=9, A[1]=4, B[3]=0. So output [9,4,0,0]. But actual output is [4,4,4,4]. So this doesn't fit. So maybe the pattern isn't consistent.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's try another example. Take Example3's first input:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,9,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nPart A: [0,0,0,4]\n\nPart B: [0,0,0,9]\n\nOutput should be B[0]=0, A[1]=0, B[3]=9. So output [0,0,9,9]. But actual output is [0,0,0,4]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for the positions of the numbers in the output. For Example0's first output [9,4,0,4], the 9 is from part B's first element, 4 from part A's second, 0 from part B's third element, and 4 from part A's fourth. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output elements are selected based on their positions in the input, but with some shifting. For example, the first element is the first occurrence after the first 2 (index5), the second is the second element in part A (index1), the third is the first element after the second 2 (index10), and the fourth is the fourth element in part A (index3).\n\nLet's check Example0's first input:\n\nindex5:9, index1:4, index10:0, index3:4 \u2192 [9,4,0,4], which matches.\n\nExample0's second input:\n\nindex5:0, index1:4, index10:0, index3:0 \u2192 [0,4,0,0], but output is [0,4,9,9]. So no.\n\nHmm, but maybe the third element is index8 (the last element of part B). Let's see. For Example0's second input, part B is [0,0,9,9], so index8 is9. Then the third element is9. The fourth element might be index9 (which is2?), but the output's fourth is9. No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is made by combining the first element of part B, the second element of part A, the third element of part B, and the fourth element of part A. For Example0's first input: part B[0]=9, part A[1]=4, part B[2]=0, part A[3]=4 \u2192 [9,4,0,4]. Correct. For the second input: part B[0]=0, part A[1]=4, part B[2]=9, part A[3]=0 \u2192 [0,4,9,0]. But output is [0,4,9,9]. Close, but fourth element is9 instead of0.\n\nWait, maybe the fourth element is part B's third element (9) instead of part A's third element. So for the second input: [0,4,9,9]. That matches. So the pattern would be:\n\nOutput[0] = part B[0]\n\nOutput[1] = part A[1]\n\nOutput[2] = part B[2]\n\nOutput[3] = part B[3]\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's first input:\n\nB[0]=9, A[1]=4, B[2]=0, B[3]=0 \u2192 output [9,4,0,0]. But actual output is [9,4,0,4]. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo that's not right. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output elements are the non-zero elements from the parts. For instance, in Example0's first input part B is [9,9,0,0], so the first two elements are non-zero. But output has 9 and 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by concatenating the first non-zero elements from each part. For example:\n\nFor part B: first non-zero is9.\n\nFor part A: first non-zero is4 (index1).\n\nFor part C: first non-zero is0 (since all zeros). \n\nBut output is [9,4,0,4]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first non-zero element of part B, the first non-zero of part A, the first non-zero of part C, and the last non-zero of part B. \n\nExample0's first input:\n\nPart B:9 (first non-zero), part A's first non-zero is4 (index1), part C's first non-zero is0, part B's last non-zero is9. Output [9,4,0,9]. Doesn't match.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nLet's look at another example. Example2's first input:\n\nInput: [4,4,4,0,2,9,9,0,9,2,0,1,0,1]\n\nOutput: [4,4,4,9]\n\nParts:\n\nA: [4,4,4,0]\n\nB: [9,9,0,9]\n\nC: [0,1,0,1]\n\nIf the pattern is part B[0], part A[1], part B[3], part A[3]:\n\nB[0]=9, A[1]=4, B[3]=9, A[3]=0 \u2192 [9,4,9,0]. Actual output is [4,4,4,9]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is part A's first four elements. But part A is [4,4,4,0], output is [4,4,4,9]. So no.\n\nWait, the output is [4,4,4,9]. Part A has 4,4,4,0. Part B has 9,9,0,9. So combining the first three of part A and last of part B. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is related to the positions of certain elements after the two 2s. For example, after each 2, there are four elements. Maybe the output is formed by taking specific positions from these sections.\n\nLooking at the first input in Example0, after the first 2 (index4), the elements are indices5-8:9,9,0,0. After the second 2 (index9), elements are 10-13:0,0,0,0.\n\nThe output is [9,4,0,4]. The first element is from after first 2 (9), second from before first 2 (4), third from after second 2 (0), fourth from before first 2 (4). So combining elements from different parts. Let's see:\n\nFor Example0's second input:\n\nAfter first 2: indices5-8:0,0,9,9. After second 2: indices10-13:0,1,0,0. Output is [0,4,9,9]. So first element is 0 (after first 2), second is4 (before first 2), third is9 (from after first 2's third element?), fourth is9 (from after first 2's fourth element). So maybe output is [B[0], A[1], B[3], B[3]]. For this example: B[0]=0, A[1]=4, B[3]=9 \u2192 [0,4,9,9]. Which matches. \n\nFor Example0's first input: B[0]=9, A[1]=4, B[3]=0 \u2192 [9,4,0,0]. But actual output is [9,4,0,4]. So no.\n\nHmm, inconsistency.\n\nWait, maybe the fourth element is from A[3]. For Example0's first input, A[3]=4. So output would be [9,4,0,4]. Which matches. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0's second input: [0,4,0,0,2,0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0]\n\nA[3] =0. So output would be [0,4,9,0]. But actual output is [0,4,9,9]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Back to square one.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is formed by taking the first occurrence of each unique number in the input list, but only considering numbers before the first 2, between the 2s, and after the second 2. But this seems vague.\n\nWait, looking at Example1's first output:\n\nInput:\n\n[4,4,4,4,2,9,0,9,0,2,0,0,0,1]\n\nOutput: [4,4,4,4]\n\nIf the output is formed by taking the elements from part A (before first 2), which is [4,4,4,4], then the output is the same as part A. But other examples don't fit. For example, Example0's first output is [9,4,0,4], which includes elements outside part A.\n\nAnother angle: The input lists have two 2s. Maybe the numbers between the two 2s (part B) are being manipulated in some way. For example, summing the elements in part B. But Example0's first input's part B sum is18, output starts with9. Maybe the first element is the sum divided by two. 18/2=9. Then Example0's second input's part B sum is0+0+9+9=18, divided by 2 is9. But output starts with0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum of part B. Example0's first input: max 9, which is the first output element. Second input's part B max is9, output starts with0. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me try to see if the output elements correspond to certain indices in the input. Let's list all training examples and see if there's a pattern in the positions.\n\nExample0:\n\nOutput [9,4,0,4]\n\nInput elements at positions 5,1,10,3: 9,4,0,4 \u2192 matches.\n\nExample0's second input's output is [0,4,9,9]. Input elements at 5,1,10,3: 0,4,0,0 \u2192 no. So that's not consistent.\n\nExample1's first output is [4,4,4,4]. Input elements at positions5:9,1:4,10:0,3:4 \u2192 [9,4,0,4]. Doesn't match. So that's not the pattern.\n\nExample2's first output is [4,4,4,9]. Input elements at5:9,1:4,10:0,3:0 \u2192 [9,4,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nExample3's first output is [0,0,0,4]. Input elements at5:0,1:0,10:0,3:4 \u2192 [0,0,0,4]. That matches. Hmm, this fits for Example3's first input.\n\nBut for other examples, it's inconsistent. For Example3's second input:\n\nInput: [4,4,0,4,2,9,0,9,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [4,4,9,4]\n\nInput elements at5:9,1:4,10:0,3:4 \u2192 [9,4,0,4]. But output is [4,4,9,4]. So doesn't fit.\n\nSo this pattern works for some examples but not all.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the output elements are taken from different parts based on some other criteria. For example, the first element is the first non-zero in part B, the second is the last non-zero in part A, the third is the first non-zero in part C, and the fourth is the last non-zero in part B.\n\nLet's test this with Example0's first input:\n\nPart B: [9,9,0,0] \u2192 first non-zero is9. Part A's last non-zero is4 (index3). Part C: all zeros, so third element 0. Part B's last non-zero is9. Output [9,4,0,9]. Actual output is [9,4,0,4]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Maybe I need to find a different pattern.\n\nLet me try to look at the test input and see if that gives any clues.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,4,0,2,9,0,9,0,2,1,1,0,0]\n\n[4,4,0,4,2,9,9,9,0,2,1,1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,0,9,9,9,2,1,1,0,1]\n\n[0,4,4,0,2,9,0,9,9,2,1,0,0,0]\n\nEach of these lists has two 2s. Let's split them into parts:\n\nFirst test input list:\n\nPart A: [0,0,4,0]\n\nPart B: [9,0,9,0]\n\nPart C: [1,1,0,0]\n\nIf the output is supposed to be similar to the training examples, perhaps based on certain positions. Let's assume the pattern is taking elements from indices5,1,10,3. \n\nFor the first test input list:\n\n5:9, 1:0, 10:1, 3:0 \u2192 [9,0,1,0]. But looking at the training examples, the outputs for the first example have elements like [9,4,0,4]. Not sure if this would be the case.\n\nAlternatively, if the pattern is the first element of part B, second element of part A, third element of part B, fourth element of part B's last element. For this test input:\n\nPart B: [9,0,9,0]. First element is9, third element is9, last element is0. Part A's second element is0. So output would be [9,0,9,0]. But looking at the training examples, maybe this isn't right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the first element of part B, the second element of part A, the first element of part C, and the third element of part A.\n\nFor the first test input:\n\nB[0]=9, A[1]=0, C[0]=1, A[3]=0 \u2192 [9,0,1,0]. Not sure.\n\nThis isn't leading me anywhere. Let's try to find a different pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's first output [9,4,0,4] and input:\n\nInput: [0,4,0,4,2,9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the elements after the first 2 and before the second 2, then some elements from before the first 2. Like taking part B's first and third elements, and part A's second and fourth. So B[0], A[1], B[2], A[3]. For Example0's first input: 9,4,0,4 \u2192 matches. For Example0's second input:\n\nPart B: [0,0,9,9], part A: [0,4,0,0]. So B[0]=0, A[1]=4, B[2]=9, A[3]=0 \u2192 output [0,4,9,0], but actual output is [0,4,9,9]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, B[0], A[1], B[3], A[3]. For Example0's second input: 0,4,9,0 \u2192 no. Actual output is [0,4,9,9]. So maybe B[0], A[1], B[3], B[3]. Which would be [0,4,9,9]. That matches. Let's check if this pattern holds.\n\nExample0's first input: B[0]=9, A[1]=4, B[3]=0 \u2192 output [9,4,0,0]. But actual output is [9,4,0,4]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: The output elements are the first occurrence of each number in the input list after the first 2. For Example0's first input, after the first 2, the elements are 9,9,0,0. So first occurrence is9, then0. But output has four elements. Doesn't explain.\n\nAlternatively, the output is part B reversed. For Example0's first input, part B reversed is [0,0,9,9], but output is [9,4,0,4]. No.\n\nLet's look for another pattern. Maybe the output is constructed by taking the digits from the first 2's position onward. For example, the first 2 is at index4. The elements after that are 9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0. But this doesn't directly help.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the elements at the positions where 2s are followed by certain numbers. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the sum of certain pairs. For Example0's first output element9 is the sum of elements5 and6 (9+9=18 \u2192 no). Not helpful.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Let me look back at all training examples and see if there's a pattern that I'm missing.\n\nLooking at Example0's four input lists and their outputs:\n\nINPUT 0: lists with various numbers. The outputs for each input list:\n\n[9,4,0,4]\n\n[0,4,9,9]\n\n[4,1,1,0]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\nLooking at the third output in Example0: [4,1,1,0]. The input list is [4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0]. The output elements 4,1,1,0. Where do these come from?\n\nPart A: [4,0,0,0]\n\nPart B: [0,0,0,0]\n\nPart C: [1,1,1,0]\n\nOutput elements are 4 (from part A[0]),1 (part C[0]),1 (part C[1]),0 (part C[3]). Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: The outputs often have elements from the input lists, but they seem to be arranged in a way that's not obvious. Let's try to see if the output is the first four elements after the first 2, but that doesn't fit. For example, in Example0's first input, after the first 2 at index4, the next four elements are 9,9,0,0. Output is [9,4,0,4]. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by combining elements from parts A and B in a specific way. For example, for each output position:\n\n- position0: part B[0]\n\n- position1: part A[1]\n\n- position2: part B[2]\n\n- position3: part A[3]\n\nLet's check Example0's first input:\n\nB[0]=9, A[1]=4, B[2]=0, A[3]=4 \u2192 [9,4,0,4]. Correct.\n\nExample0's second input:\n\nB[0]=0, A[1]=4, B[2]=9, A[3]=0 \u2192 [0,4,9,0]. But output is [0,4,9,9]. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo maybe position3 is part B[3]. Let's try that:\n\nFor Example0's second input:\n\nB[3]=9. So output would be [0,4,9,9]. Which matches. So the pattern would be:\n\nOutput[0] = part B[0]\n\nOutput[1] = part A[1]\n\nOutput[2] = part B[2]\n\nOutput[3] = part B[3]\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with other examples.\n\nExample0's third input:\n\nInput: [4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0]\n\nPart B: [0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput is [4,1,1,0]. According to pattern:\n\nB[0]=0, A[1]=0, B[2]=0, B[3]=0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0]. Doesn't match. So this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nExample1's first input:\n\nPart B: [9,0,9,0]\n\nOutput: [4,4,4,4]\n\nAccording to pattern: [9,4,9,0]. Not matching.\n\nExample3's first input:\n\nPart B: [0,0,0,9]\n\nOutput: [0,0,0,4]\n\nPattern output would be [0,0,0,9]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This approach works for some examples but not all. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is the first four elements of the input list, but after some transformation. For instance, maybe summing each pair. But Example0's first input starts with [0,4,0,4], output is [9,4,0,4]. Doesn't seem related.\n\nAnother angle: The numbers 9 and 1 appear in certain positions. Maybe the output is formed by taking the count of 9s and 1s in specific parts. For example, in Example0's first input, part B has two 9s. Output starts with9. Part C has no 1s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the sum of the digits in each segment modulo some number. For example, part A sum, part B sum, etc. But Example0's first output doesn't align with that.\n\nWait, let's look at the Test Input. For the first test input list:\n\n[0,0,4,0,2,9,0,9,0,2,1,1,0,0]\n\nIf the output is formed by taking elements from positions 5,1,7,8:\n\n5:9, 1:0,7:9,8:0 \u2192 [9,0,9,0]. But what would the expected output be based on training examples?\n\nIn the training examples, when part B has 9s, the output starts with9. Maybe the first element is the first 9 in part B. Here, part B is [9,0,9,0]. So first 9 is at position0 of part B. So output[0] is9. Then output[1] is part A's second element (index1) which is0. Output[2] is part B's third element (9?), output[3] is part B's last element (0). So [9,0,9,0]. But how does this align with training examples?\n\nAlternatively, if the pattern is [B[0], A[1], B[2], B[3]], then this test input would be [9,0,9,0]. But looking at the training examples, this might not match. For example, Example0's second input has B[0]=0, A[1]=4, B[2]=9, B[3]=9 \u2192 [0,4,9,9], which matches the output. So this pattern works for Example0's second input. \n\nAnother example: Example2's first input has part B as [9,9,0,9]. So B[0]=9, A[1]=4, B[2]=0, B[3]=9 \u2192 output [9,4,0,9]. But the actual output is [4,4,4,9]. So no.\n\nThis pattern works for some examples but not all. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a consistent pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples where the pattern works. \n\nAssuming the pattern is:\n\nOutput[0] = part B[0]\n\nOutput[1] = part A[1]\n\nOutput[2] = part B[2]\n\nOutput[3] = part B[3]\n\nLet's apply this to the Test Input.\n\nTest Input first list:\n\nPart A: [0,0,4,0]\n\nPart B: [9,0,9,0]\n\nOutput would be [9,0,9,0].\n\nBut looking at training examples, when part B has 9, the output starts with9. But in some training examples, this holds, others not. For example, Example0's first input's output starts with9 (B[0]=9). Example0's second input's output starts with0 (B[0]=0).\n\nAnother Test Input list:\n\nSecond test input: [4,4,0,4,2,9,9,9,0,2,1,1,1,0]\n\nPart A: [4,4,0,4]\n\nPart B: [9,9,9,0]\n\nOutput would be [9,4,9,0]. But looking at similar training examples, like Example3's fourth input:\n\nInput: [0,4,4,4,2,0,9,0,0,2,1,1,1,1]\n\nOutput: [1,4,4,4]\n\nPart B: [0,9,0,0]\n\nSo according to the pattern, output would be [0,4,0,0], which doesn't match the actual output. So this pattern isn't reliable.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a pattern where the output is the first four non-zero elements in the input list, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first four elements after the first 2, but that also doesn't fit.\n\nAfter spending a lot of time and not finding a clear pattern, I think the most plausible hypothesis is that the output elements are derived from specific positions in the input, namely indices5,1,10,3. This worked for Example0's first input, Example3's first input, and some others but not all. Maybe there are exceptions due to different rules, but given the time, I'll proceed with this hypothesis.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFirst test input list:\n\nIndices5:9, 1:0, 10:1,3:0 \u2192 output [9,0,1,0].\n\nSecond test input list:\n\nIndices5:9,1:4,10:1,3:4 \u2192 [9,4,1,4].\n\nThird test input list:\n\nIndices5:0,1:0,10:1,3:0 \u2192 [0,0,1,0].\n\nFourth test input list:\n\nIndices5:9,1:4,10:1,3:0 \u2192 [9,4,1,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, like Example0's first output was [9,4,0,4], which matches indices5,1,10,3. So let's check the third test input:\n\nThird test input list: [0,0,0,0,2,0,9,9,9,2,1,1,0,1]\n\nIndices5:0,1:0,10:1,3:0 \u2192 output [0,0,1,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example1's third input:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,9,0,2,1,0,1,0]\n\nOutput: [1,0,9,0].\n\nWhich according to indices5,1,10,3: indices5=0,1=0,10=1,3=0 \u2192 [0,0,1,0], but actual output is [1,0,9,0]. So this pattern doesn't hold. \n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe the pattern is different. Another possibility is that the output elements are the first four elements after the second 2. Let's check:\n\nExample0's first input has part C (after second 2) as [0,0,0,0]. Output is [9,4,0,4]. No relation.\n\nExample0's second input's part C is [0,1,0,0]. Output is [0,4,9,9]. No.\n\nExample1's first input's part C is [0,0,0,1]. Output is [4,4,4,4]. No.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the answer is based on the positions 5,1,7,8. Let's try for the test input.\n\nFirst test input list:\n\nIndices5:9,1:0,7:9,8:0 \u2192 [9,0,9,0].\n\nBut looking at Example0's second input, which has output [0,4,9,9], indices5:0,1:4,7:9,8:9 \u2192 [0,4,9,9], which matches. Example0's first input would be indices5:9,1:4,7:0,8:0 \u2192 [9,4,0,0]. But actual output is [9,4,0,4]. Not matching. \n\nBut for Example0's third input:\n\nInput: [4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0]\n\n indices5:0,1:0,7:0,8:0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0], but output is [4,1,1,0]. So no.\n\nThis pattern works for some examples but not all. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output elements are derived from the positions5,1,7,8 of the input lists. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFirst test input list: [0,0,4,0,2,9,0,9,0,2,1,1,0,0]\n\npositions5:9,1:0,7:9,8:0 \u2192 output [9,0,9,0].\n\nSecond test input list: [4,4,0,4,2,9,9,9,0,2,1,1,1,0]\n\npositions5:9,1:4,7:9,8:0 \u2192 [9,4,9,0].\n\nThird test input list: [0,0,0,0,2,0,9,9,9,2,1,1,0,1]\n\npositions5:0,1:0,7:9,8:9 \u2192 [0,0,9,9].\n\nFourth test input list: [0,4,4,0,2,9,0,9,9,2,1,0,0,0]\n\npositions5:9,1:4,7:9,8:9 \u2192 [9,4,9,9].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example0's first output would be [9,4,0,0], but actual output is [9,4,0,4]. So this pattern doesn't hold. However, considering the test input and the possible pattern from some examples, this might be the intended answer. \n\nLooking back at the training examples, Example2's third output is [1,4,9,4]. The third input list in Example2 is [0,4,0,4,2,0,0,9,9,2,1,0,0,1]. Positions5:0,1:4,7:9,8:9 \u2192 [0,4,9,9], but actual output is [1,4,9,4]. So this doesn't fit. \n\nI think I need to abandon this approach and look for another pattern. Maybe the output is the sum of certain pairs of elements. For example, output[0] is sum of indices5 and6. Example0's first input: 5+6=9+9=18 \u2192 18 mod 10=8. Doesn't match output 9. So no.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is the elements in the positions of the first occurrence of each number in the input list. Not sure.\n\nAfter trying multiple approaches without success, I'll make a educated guess based on the examples where certain positions seem to fit. For example, in Example0's first input, the output elements are indices5,1,10,3. Let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest Input lists:\n\nFirst list:\n\nindices5:9,1:0,10:1,3:0 \u2192 [9,0,1,0].\n\nSecond list:\n\nindices5:9,1:4,10:1,3:4 \u2192 [9,4,1,4].\n\nThird list:\n\nindices5:0,1:0,10:1,3:0 \u2192 [0,0,1,0].\n\nFourth list:\n\nindices5:9,1:4,10:1,3:0 \u2192 [9,4,1,0].\n\nBut looking at the training outputs, this doesn't align. For example, Example0's first output is [9,4,0,4], which corresponds to indices5,1,10,3. For Example0's first input, index10 is0, which matches the third element of the output. Index3 is4, which matches the fourth element. So this works. \n\nSimilarly, Example3's first input output is [0,0,0,4], which is indices5:0,1:0,10:0,3:4 \u2192 matches.\n\nExample2's first output [4,4,4,9]: input indices5:9,1:4,10:0,3:0 \u2192 [9,4,0,0], which doesn't match. So this pattern is inconsistent.\n\nHowever, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach for the test input and see if it matches.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists. There are several training examples, and I need to study them to find the common rule. Then apply that rule to the test input.\n\nFirst, looking at the input and output pairs. Each example has four input arrays and four output arrays. So, each input array corresponds to one output array. Let's take the first example, Example 0:\n\nInputs are four arrays, and outputs are four arrays. Let's look at the first input and output pair:\n\nInput: [0,4,0,4,2,9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\nOutput: [9,4,0,4]\n\nHmm. The input array is longer (14 elements) than the output (4 elements). So the output is somehow derived from the input. Let's see. Maybe the output is taking certain elements from the input array. Let's check positions.\n\nLooking at the input array's elements 0-3: [0,4,0,4], but the output is [9,4,0,4]. Wait, the 9 comes from later in the input. Let's check the input array's elements after position 4 (since the first four are 0,4,0,4, then 2,9,9,0...). So maybe the output takes elements from positions 4 onwards? Let's see. The output's first element is 9. In the input, the elements after index 4 (which is 2) are 9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0. So 9 is at positions 5 and 6. How does the first output element become 9? Maybe the sum of some elements. Alternatively, looking for the first occurrence of a non-zero after a certain point?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is combining elements from different parts of the input. Let's check other examples to see if there's a pattern.\n\nTake Example 0's second input and output:\n\nInput: [0,4,0,0,2,0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0]\nOutput: [0,4,9,9]\n\nSo the output here is [0,4,9,9]. The input starts with [0,4,0,0,2,0,0,9,9...]. The output elements are 0,4,9,9. The 0 and 4 are the first two elements, then 9s from positions 7 and 8. Maybe the output is taking elements from positions 0,1,7,8? Let's check for the first example:\n\nOriginal input [0,4,0,4,2,9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. The output is [9,4,0,4]. If positions 0,1,7,8 would be 0,4,0,0. That doesn't match. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by combining two parts: the first part is the sum of certain elements, but that might not fit. Let's think of another approach.\n\nWait, all the input arrays are length 14, and outputs are length 4. Maybe each element in the output is derived from a specific position in the input. Let's check if there's a pattern in which positions from the input are taken to form the output.\n\nFor Example 0's first input/output:\n\nInput indices 0-13: 0,4,0,4,2,9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0\n\nOutput: [9,4,0,4]\n\nLooking at the output elements:\n\n9: maybe from position 5 (input[5] is 9) or 6 (9). The first element in output is 9.\n\n4: input[1] is 4.\n\n0: input[2] is 0.\n\n4: input[3] is 4.\n\nBut that would be taking positions 5,1,2,3. Not sure. Let's check another example.\n\nTake Example 0's output [9,4,0,4]. Let's see another example. Example 1's first output is [4,4,4,4]. Input for that is [4,4,4,4,2,9,0,9,0,2,0,0,0,1]. Output elements are all 4s. The first four elements are 4,4,4,4. So maybe the output is the first four elements, but in Example 0's first case, that's [0,4,0,4], but output is [9,4,0,4]. So that doesn't match. So the output isn't the first four elements.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is constructed by taking elements from the input array after a certain point. For example, the input arrays have a 2 in the 4th position (index 4). Let's check if the elements after the 2 are important.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input: After index 4 (value 2), the elements are 9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0. The output starts with 9. Maybe the first element of the output is the first occurrence of a non-zero after the 2. But then in this case, the first elements after 2 are 9,9. So maybe taking the first two elements after the 2 (9 and 9) and then combining with something else. But the output is [9,4,0,4]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input array is split into parts. For example, perhaps each input array has a 2 at position 4. Let's check all input arrays:\n\nLooking at all training examples:\n\nYes, in all input arrays, the 4th element (index 4) is 2. So that's a consistent point. Maybe the input is split into two parts: before and after the 2. The 2 is at position 4, so the first part is positions 0-3, and the second part starts at position 5. Then the output could be some combination of these parts.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input:\n\nFirst part: [0,4,0,4], second part (after 2): [9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. The output is [9,4,0,4]. Let's see:\n\nMaybe the first element of the output is the first non-zero in the second part. The second part starts with 9,9. So the first element is 9. Then the next elements are 4,0,4. Which are the first part's elements (0,4,0,4) but taking 4 (position 1), 0 (position 2), 4 (position 3). So maybe the output is constructed as [first non-zero from second part, first part's 1st element, first part's 2nd element, first part's 3rd element]. Wait, but in the output [9,4,0,4], the first part's elements are [0,4,0,4]. So 4 is the second element (index1), 0 is index2, 4 index3. So the output is [9, 4,0,4]. That would mean the output is:\n\nFirst element: first non-zero after 2 (positions 5-13). Then the next three elements are the first three elements of the first part (positions 0-3). Wait, the first part is [0,4,0,4], so the first three elements are 0,4,0. But the output's next three elements are 4,0,4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Let's see.\n\nWait, the output for Example 0's first input is [9,4,0,4]. The first part is [0,4,0,4], which would be positions 0-3. So maybe the output is combining elements from the second part (after 2) and the first part. For instance, maybe the first element of the output is the first non-zero in the second part, then the next three elements are the first part's elements starting from index 1. So index1 (4), index2 (0), index3 (4). So that would give 4,0,4. Then combined with the first element (9) gives [9,4,0,4]. That matches the output. Let's check another example to see if this holds.\n\nTake Example 0's second input:\n\nInput: [0,4,0,0,2,0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0]\n\nFirst part (0-3): [0,4,0,0]. Second part (after 2): [0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0]. The first non-zero in the second part is 9 at position7. So the first element of the output would be 9. Then the next three elements are the first part's elements starting from index1: 4, 0, 0. But the output is [0,4,9,9]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the first part's elements (positions 0-3) and replacing some elements based on the second part. For example, the output's elements could be the first part's elements, but if the second part has a certain value, it replaces a corresponding element in the first part.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input: first part [0,4,0,4], output [9,4,0,4]. The first element (0) is replaced by 9. So maybe the first element of the output is the maximum value in the second part, or the first non-zero in the second part. The second part starts with 9,9. So first element is 9. Then the rest of the output is the original first part's elements (4,0,4). But the output is [9,4,0,4], which matches. Let's check the second example in Example 0:\n\nInput second array: [0,4,0,0,2,0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0]. First part is [0,4,0,0]. The second part starts with 0,0,9,9. The first non-zero here is 9. So output first element is 9. Then the next three elements are 4,0,0. But the output is [0,4,9,9]. That doesn't fit. So this approach may not be correct.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider the outputs. For Example 0's first output, [9,4,0,4], the elements 4,0,4 are the same as the first part (0,4,0,4) except the first element is replaced by 9. Where does 9 come from? The second part (after 2) has 9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0. So maybe the first two 9s in the second part contribute to the output. But how?\n\nAnother idea: The second part of the input (after the 2) has some elements, and maybe the output elements are the first four elements after the 2. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's first input: After 2, the elements are [9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. The first four elements are 9,9,0,0. The output is [9,4,0,4]. Not matching. But maybe the output takes the first element of the second part (9), then the first part's elements [4,0,4]. But how?\n\nWait, the output is four elements. Let's see for Example 0:\n\nFirst input's output [9,4,0,4]. The 9 is from the second part, the rest are from the first part (positions 1,2,3: 4,0,4). So output is [9,4,0,4].\n\nSecond input's output [0,4,9,9]. The first element is 0, which is the first element of the first part. Then 4 is the second element of the first part. Then 9,9. Maybe the 9s are from the second part. Let's look at the second part of the second input: [0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0]. So first two non-zero elements are 9,9. So maybe the first two elements of the output are the first part's first two elements, and the next two are the first two non-zero elements in the second part. That could fit. For example:\n\nFirst input's first part is [0,4,0,4]. Second part's first two non-zero are 9,9. So output would be [0,4,9,9]. But in the first example's output, it's [9,4,0,4], which doesn't fit. So maybe this isn't the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be combining the first part and the second part in a different way. Let's consider that each output element corresponds to a position in the input array. For example, perhaps the output elements are the 5th, 1st, 6th, 3rd elements. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's first input, output is [9,4,0,4]. The input's elements:\n\n5th element (index 5) is 9 \u2192 first element.\n\n1st element (index1) is 4 \u2192 second element.\n\n6th element (index6) is 9 \u2192 but third output is 0. Doesn't fit. So that's not.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is the sum of pairs in the input. Let's see for Example 0's first input:\n\nInput has 14 elements. Output has 4 elements. Maybe sum every 3 or 4 elements. 14 elements divided into groups. 14 divided by 3 is 4 groups with 2 remaining. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The input arrays have 14 elements. The output arrays have 4 elements. Let's check if each output element is derived from a specific segment of the input. For example, the first output element could be from the first part (before 2), the second from the next part. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 2 in the input is a separator. The first part is before the 2 (elements 0-3), then elements after. Maybe the output is constructed by taking elements from the second part (after the 2), but how?\n\nWait, in Example 0's first input, after the 2 (position4) are elements 9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0. The output's first element is 9, which is the first element after the 2. Then the output's next elements are 4,0,4. Those are elements from the first part: 4 (position1), 0 (position2), 4 (position3). So maybe the output is:\n\n[first element after 2, element1 of first part, element2 of first part, element3 of first part].\n\nIn this case, that would give [9,4,0,4], which matches the output. Let's check the second example in Example 0:\n\nInput: [0,4,0,0,2,0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0]. After the 2, the elements are [0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0]. The first element after 2 is 0, then 0. The first non-zero is 9 at position7. So maybe the first element is the first non-zero after the 2. Then the next three elements are first part's elements 1,2,3. So first part's elements are [0,4,0,0]. So elements1:4, element2:0, element3:0. So the output would be [9,4,0,0]. But the actual output is [0,4,9,9]. Hmm, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first element of the output is the sum of the elements after the 2 up to a certain point. But in Example 0's first input, after 2 is 9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0. Sum of first two 9s is 18, but output is 9. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking elements from the first part and second part in a specific order, such as first element from second part, then elements from first part. But this doesn't explain the outputs.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the output elements in the input arrays. For Example 0's first output [9,4,0,4], the 9 appears in the input's positions5 and6. The 4s are in positions1 and3. 0 in position2. So maybe the output is combining elements from positions5,1,2,3. So positions5 is 9, position1 is4, position2 is0, position3 is4. That gives [9,4,0,4]. Which matches. Let's check the second example in Example 0.\n\nSecond input's output is [0,4,9,9]. The input is [0,4,0,0,2,0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0]. So if we take positions5,1,7,8. Position5 is0, position1 is4, position7 is9, position8 is9. So the output would be [0,4,9,9]. Which matches exactly. Oh, this seems promising.\n\nSo the pattern could be taking elements from positions5,1,7,8 of the input array. Let's check this with other examples.\n\nExample0's third input:\n\nInput: [4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0]\n\nOutput: [4,1,1,0]\n\nCheck positions5,1,7,8: input positions5 is0, position1 is0, position7 is0, position8 is0. But the output is [4,1,1,0]. That doesn't match. So this approach is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe the positions are different. Let me check again.\n\nFirst example of Example0:\n\nOutput is [9,4,0,4]. The elements in input positions5,1,2,3: position5 is9, 1 is4, 2 is0, 3 is4 \u2192 9,4,0,4. That matches.\n\nSecond example:\n\nOutput [0,4,9,9]. Input positions5,1,7,8: 0 (position5), 4 (1), 9 (7), 9 (8). Which matches.\n\nThird example:\n\nInput [4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0]. The output is [4,1,1,0]. Taking positions5,1,7,8: 0,0,0,0. Doesn't match. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output elements are the elements at positions5,6,7,8 of the input array. Let's check:\n\nExample0 first input's positions5-8: 9,9,0,0 \u2192 output is [9,4,0,4]. Doesn't match. Second input's positions5-8: 0,0,9,9 \u2192 output [0,4,9,9]. The output's third and fourth elements are 9,9. So positions7 and8 here are 9 and9. But the output's first two elements are 0 and4. Which would be positions5 and1. So maybe combining positions5,1,7,8 again. For this example, yes.\n\nThird example's input positions5-8: 0,0,0,0. Output is [4,1,1,0]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that each input array has a 2 in position4, and perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from positions before the 2 and after, but in a different way.\n\nLooking at Example0's third input:\n\nInput: [4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0]\n\nOutput: [4,1,1,0]\n\nHmm, the output's first element is4 (position0 of input), then 1,1,0. The 1s and 0 come from positions10,11,12. So maybe the output is formed by taking elements from positions0,10,11,12. Let's check:\n\nInput positions0 is4, 10 is1, 11 is1, 12 is1. Output is [4,1,1,0]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first element from the second part (after 2) which is non-zero, then the first three elements of the first part (before 2). Let's see:\n\nExample0's first input: second part starts with9,9, so first non-zero is9. First part elements are0,4,0,4. Taking the first three gives0,4,0. Then output is9 followed by0,4,0 \u2192 [9,0,4,0]. Doesn't match. But the actual output is [9,4,0,4]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first four elements of the input array, but with the first element replaced by the first non-zero from the second part. For example:\n\nExample0 first input: first part [0,4,0,4], output [9,4,0,4]. Replaced 0 with 9.\n\nSecond input: first part [0,4,0,0], output [0,4,9,9]. The first element remains 0, but the last two elements are replaced by 9s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the sum of the first part (elements0-3) and the sum of the second part (elements5-13), then combined. But the output has four elements, not sums.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output element is the maximum value in certain sections of the input. For example:\n\nFirst output element is the max of the second part (after 2), second element is the max of the first part, third and fourth elements are other maxes. But in Example0's first input, second part has max 9. First part max is4. Output is [9,4,0,4]. The third element is0, which is part of the first part. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be [max of second part, first part elements excluding first]. Like, max second part is9, then first part's elements1-3 (4,0,4). Which gives [9,4,0,4]. Which fits. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0's second input: second part [0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0]. Max is9. First part [0,4,0,0]. Elements1-3:4,0,0. So output would be [9,4,0,0]. But actual output is [0,4,9,9]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for the positions in the input arrays that correspond to the output elements. For example, in Example0's first output [9,4,0,4], where are these elements in the input?\n\n9 appears in positions5 and6.\n\n4 appears in positions1 and3.\n\n0 is in positions0,2, etc.\n\n4 is position3.\n\nBut how to choose which positions to pick.\n\nAnother observation: All input arrays have 14 elements. The outputs have 4 elements. Maybe the outputs are derived by selecting every third element, or combining elements in some other way. Let's see.\n\nLooking at Example0's first input:\n\nIndices:0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13\n\nValues:0 4 0 4 2 9 9 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:9,4,0,4\n\nSo 9 is at5,4 at1,0 at2,4 at3. So indices5,1,2,3. Hmm, but why these indices?\n\nAlternatively, the output is made by taking elements from indices5,1,7,3. Let's check:\n\n5:9, 1:4,7:0,3:4 \u2192 [9,4,0,4]. Which matches. But why these indices?\n\nIn Example0's second input:\n\nIndices5:0,1:4,7:9,3:0 \u2192 output [0,4,9,9]. But according to this, the output would be [0,4,0,0], which doesn't match. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think about the output as combining elements from the second part and first part. For example, output element0 is the first element in the second part (after the 2), element1 is the first element of the first part, element2 is the second element of the second part, element3 is the third element of the first part. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be formed by taking the first element of the second part, then the first part's elements in reverse. For Example0's first input, the second part starts with9, first part is [0,4,0,4]. Reverse of first part would be [4,0,4,0]. Then output is [9,4,0,4]. But this doesn't align. Wait, the output's last three elements are4,0,4, which are the first three elements of the first part. So maybe first element is from the second part, then first three elements of first part. For Example0's first input, that would be [9,0,4,0], which doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Let's look for a different pattern.\n\nWait, another observation: the test input has four arrays, each of 14 elements. The outputs for each example are four arrays. So each input array in the test corresponds to one output array, and each output array is generated from its respective input array. So each output array is generated from its own input array. So the pattern must be applied to each input array individually.\n\nLet me re-examine Example0's first input and output:\n\nInput: [0,4,0,4,2,9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [9,4,0,4]\n\nThe output elements are 9,4,0,4. Let's see if these numbers appear in the input in a certain order. The 9 is from positions5 or6, the 4 is from position1 or3, 0 from position0,2, etc.\n\nWhat if the output is the first occurrence of each number in the input? No, because the output is four elements. For example, the input has 0,4,0,4,2,9,9,... So first occurrences are 0,4,2,9, but the output is 9,4,0,4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the elements from the input array starting at position5 and taking four elements. For Example0's first input, position5 is9, next three elements are9,0,0. So output would be [9,9,0,0]. Doesn't match. But the actual output is [9,4,0,4].\n\nAnother idea: The output is the concatenation of the first non-zero element in the second part (after 2) and the first three elements of the first part. For Example0's first input, the first non-zero in the second part is9 (positions5), then first part's first three elements0,4,0. So output [9,0,4,0]. No, doesn't match.\n\nWait, let's think about the first output element. It's often 9 or 4 or 0. In Example0's first output, it's9. In Example0's second output, it's0. Maybe the first element of the output is the first element after the 2 (position5). So for Example0's first input, position5 is9. For second input, position5 is0. Third input, position5 is0. Fourth input, position5 is9.\n\nExample0's first output's first element is9 (position5). Second output's first element is0 (position5). Third input's output first element is4 (position5's value is0? Wait, third input in Example0 is [4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0]. Position5 is0, but the output is [4,1,1,0]. So first element is4, which is position0. So that contradicts the previous idea.\n\nHmm. Maybe the first element of the output is the first non-zero element after the 2. For Example0's first input, after 2, positions5 and6 are9,9. So first non-zero is9. For second input, after 2, positions5 and6 are0,0, then positions7 and8 are9,9. So first non-zero is9. So the first element would be9, but the output is0. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output elements are the first four non-zero elements in the input array. For Example0's first input, the input is [0,4,0,4,2,9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. The first four non-zero elements are4,4,2,9. But the output is9,4,0,4. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the four elements at positions where the input's value changes. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compare multiple examples. Let's take Example0's input and output pairs:\n\nInput 0: [0,4,0,4,2,9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0] \u2192 Output [9,4,0,4]\n\nInput1: [0,4,0,0,2,0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0] \u2192 Output [0,4,9,9]\n\nInput2: [4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0] \u2192 Output [4,1,1,0]\n\nInput3: [4,4,4,4,2,9,0,9,0,2,1,1,0,1] \u2192 Output [4,4,4,4]\n\nLooking at these outputs, perhaps the output elements are the first four elements of the input, but with some elements replaced by values from the second part.\n\nFor example, in input0, the first part is [0,4,0,4], and the output is [9,4,0,4]. The first element is replaced by 9 from the second part. \n\nIn input1, first part [0,4,0,0], output is [0,4,9,9]. The third and fourth elements are replaced by 9s from the second part.\n\nIn input2, first part [4,0,0,0], output is [4,1,1,0]. The second and third elements are replaced by 1s from the second part.\n\nIn input3, first part is [4,4,4,4], output is same as first part. So no replacements.\n\nThis suggests that elements in the first part are being replaced by values from the second part. But how to determine which elements are replaced and what values are used.\n\nPerhaps the replacement is based on the positions of non-zero elements in the second part. Let's look at input0's second part: [9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. The first two elements are 9s. So maybe replace the first element of the first part with 9. \n\nInput1's second part: [0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0]. The first two non-zeros are9,9 at positions7,8. So perhaps replace the third and fourth elements of the first part with these 9s.\n\nInput2's second part: [0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0]. The first non-zero after the 2 is1 at position10. But output is [4,1,1,0]. So maybe replace the second and third elements with1.\n\nThis seems too vague. Maybe there's a specific rule for replacement.\n\nAlternative hypothesis: The output is formed by taking the first four elements of the input array, but replacing any element that is 0 with the first non-zero value from the second part. \n\nFor Example0's first input: first part [0,4,0,4]. The first element is0 \u2192 replaced by9. Third element is0 \u2192 replaced by9. So the output would be [9,4,9,4]. But actual output is [9,4,0,4]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps replace the first element of the first part with the first non-zero in the second part, the second element of the first part with the second non-zero in the second part, etc. But if there aren't enough non-zeros in the second part, use the original value.\n\nExample0's first input:\n\nSecond part:9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0. Non-zeros:9,9,2. So first non-zero is9. Replace first element of first part (0 \u21929). Second non-zero is9 \u2192 replace second element of first part (4 \u21929). Third non-zero is2 \u2192 replace third element (0 \u21922). Fourth non-zero is none \u2192 keep original 4. Output would be [9,9,2,4]. Doesn't match the actual output [9,4,0,4].\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by taking elements from the first part and second part alternately. For example, output element0 is the first element of the second part, element1 is the second element of the first part, element2 is the third element of the second part, element3 is the fourth element of the first part. \n\nFor Example0's first input:\n\nSecond part first element:9. First part second element:4. Second part third element:0. First part fourth element:4. So output [9,4,0,4]. Which matches.\n\nExample0's second input:\n\nSecond part first element:0. First part second element:4. Second part third element:9. First part fourth element:0. So output [0,4,9,0]. But actual output is [0,4,9,9]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThird example in Example0:\n\nInput is [4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0]. Second part starts with0,0,0,0. So first element of second part is0. First part second element is0. Second part third element is0. First part fourth element is0. Output would be [0,0,0,0], but actual output is [4,1,1,0]. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for a pattern where the output is derived by looking at the positions of certain digits. For example, in Example0's first output [9,4,0,4], 9 is the first digit after the 2 (position5), 4 is position1, 0 is position2, and4 is position3. So maybe the output is formed by [5th,1st,2nd,3rd elements of input]. \n\nFor the first example:\n\n5th element is9 (index5), 1st is4 (index1), 2nd is0 (index2), 3rd is4 (index3). So output [9,4,0,4], which matches.\n\nSecond example's input: [0,4,0,0,2,0,0,9,9,2,0,1,0,0]. 5th element (index5) is0, 1st (index1) is4, 2nd (index2) is0, 3rd (index3) is0. So output would be [0,4,0,0]. But actual output is [0,4,9,9]. So this doesn't fit. Unless the positions are different.\n\nWait, maybe the indices are not zero-based. For example, if the first element is index1. But the first example's input's 5th element (index5) would be9, which is correct. But the second example's 5th element is0, but the output's third element is9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output elements are positions5, 7,9,3. For Example0's first input:5 is9,7 is0,9 is2,3 is4. Output would be [9,0,2,4]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: The output elements are the values from the input array at positions5,7,9, and 11. Let's check:\n\nExample0's first input:\n\n5:9,7:0,9:2,11:0 \u2192 output [9,0,2,0]. Not matching.\n\nExample0's second input:\n\n5:0,7:9,9:2,11:1 \u2192 [0,9,2,1]. Actual output [0,4,9,9]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach. Maybe each output element is the sum of certain pairs in the input. For example, first output element is sum of positions5 and6, second is sum of positions1 and2, third is sum of positions3 and4, etc. But Example0's first input:\n\nsum of5 and6:9+9=18. Second output element is4+0=4. Third:4+2=6. Output is [18,4,6,...]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, multiply certain positions. Not likely.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0's output, the numbers 4 and9 appear frequently. These are the same numbers present in the input arrays. Maybe the output is composed of the maximum values from certain sections. For example:\n\n- The first output element is the maximum of the second part (after 2).\n\n- The second output element is the maximum of the first part.\n\n- The third and fourth elements are other max values.\n\nExample0's first input: second part max is9, first part max is4. Output is [9,4,0,4]. Hmm, 0 and4 are from the first part. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output is made by taking the first part's elements, but if there's a non-zero in the second part, it replaces the corresponding zero in the first part. For example, in Example0's first input, the first part has [0,4,0,4]. The second part has 9,9. So replace the first 0 with9. Output becomes [9,4,0,4]. Which matches.\n\nSecond example's input: first part [0,4,0,0], second part has 9,9. Replace the first 0 with9 and third 0 with9. So output [9,4,9,9]. But actual output is [0,4,9,9]. So this doesn't fit. Unless the replacement is done differently.\n\nAlternatively, replace zeros in the first part with non-zeros from the second part in order. So first zero in first part is replaced by first non-zero in second part. Second zero is replaced by second non-zero, etc.\n\nExample0's first input first part: [0,4,0,4]. Zeros are at positions0 and2. Second part non-zeros:9,9,2. Replace position0 with9, position2 with9. So first part becomes [9,4,9,4]. But output is [9,4,0,4]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, replace zeros in the first part with the first non-zero in the second part. For example, first part's zeros are replaced by9, resulting in [9,4,9,4]. Still not matching.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's consider another angle. All the outputs are four elements, and the first element often comes from the second part of the input. Let's look at Example0's first output:9 from the second part, and the rest from the first part. Second output:0 from first part, then 4, then 9,9 from second part. Third output:4 from first part, then 1,1 from second part. Fourth output: all from first part.\n\nIs there a pattern where the output is a combination of elements from the first part and the second part, with the number of elements taken from each part depending on their non-zero counts?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the first four non-zero elements from the entire input. Let's check Example0's first input:0,4,0,4,2,9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0. The non-zero elements are4,4,2,9,9,2. First four non-zero are4,4,2,9. Output is9,4,0,4. So this doesn't match.\n\nAnother observation: The output elements often contain the numbers from the first part and some numbers from the second part. For example, in Example0's first output, the 9 is from the second part, and 4,0,4 from the first. In Example0's second output, 0 and4 from first part, and9,9 from second. In the third output,4 from first part, 1,1 from second. Fourth output, all from first part.\n\nThis suggests that the output is combining elements from the first part and the second part, but the way they are combined varies. Perhaps the output is the first part, but with elements replaced by the earliest non-zero elements in the second part, starting from the beginning.\n\nFor example:\n\nTake the first part, then for each element in the first part, if it is zero, replace it with the next available non-zero from the second part.\n\nExample0's first input: first part [0,4,0,4]. Second part non-zeros are9,9,2. Replace the first 0 with9, then the next 0 (third element) with9. So output becomes [9,4,9,4]. But actual output is [9,4,0,4]. So no.\n\nAlternatively, only replace the first zero in the first part with the first non-zero from the second part. So Example0's first input becomes [9,4,0,4]. Which matches. Second example: first part [0,4,0,0]. Replace first zero with9 (second part's first non-zero is9), so output [9,4,0,0]. But actual output is [0,4,9,9]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This isn't working.\n\nLet's think of the output as the first part, but with the first element replaced by the first non-zero from the second part, and the fourth element replaced by the last non-zero from the second part. For Example0's first input, first non-zero in second part is9, last non-zero is2. So output would be [9,4,0,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the first part, but elements are replaced by the corresponding elements from the second part if they are non-zero. For example, if in the second part, position5 is non-zero, replace the first part's first element with it. If position6 is non-zero, replace first part's second element, and so on. \n\nExample0's first input: second part starts at5:9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0. So positions5-8:9,9,0,0. First part's elements0-3:0,4,0,4. Replace first part's elements where the second part's elements (starting from5) are non-zero. So position5 (9) is non-zero \u2192 replace first part's element0 (0) with9. Position6 (9) non-zero \u2192 replace first part's element1 (4) with9. So the output would be [9,9,0,4]. But actual output is [9,4,0,4]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut wait, the output's second element is4, not9. So maybe only replace if the first part's element is zero. So, first part's element0 is0 \u2192 replace with9. Element1 is4 (non-zero) \u2192 leave as4. Element2 is0 \u2192 replace with9 (from position7). Element3 is4 \u2192 leave. So output would be [9,4,9,4]. But actual output is [9,4,0,4]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample0's second input: first part [0,4,0,0], second part positions5-8:0,0,9,9. So replace element0 (0) with0 (position5 is0, no change). Then element2 (0) with9 (position7). Element3 (0) with9 (position8). So output [0,4,9,9]. Which matches the actual output. So this could be the pattern.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n\nThe output is formed by taking the first part (elements0-3), and replacing any zero elements with the corresponding elements from the second part (starting from position5). \n\nMore precisely, for each element in the first part (positions0-3):\n\n- if the element is zero, replace it with the element from position5 + i in the input array.\n\n- else, leave it as is.\n\nSo for the first part's elements, iterate through each:\n\ni=0: if first_part[i] is zero, replace with input[5+i] (i=0: input5+0=5).\n\ni=1: input[5+1=6]\n\ni=2: input[5+2=7]\n\ni=3: input[5+3=8]\n\nLet's test this with Example0's first input:\n\nFirst part: [0,4,0,4]\n\nFor each element:\n\ni=0: 0 \u2192 replace with input[5+0=5]=9 \u2192 becomes9\n\ni=1:4 \u2192 remain4\n\ni=2:0 \u2192 replace with input[5+2=7]=0 \u2192 becomes0\n\ni=3:4 \u2192 remain4\n\nOutput: [9,4,0,4]. Which matches the actual output.\n\nExample0's second input:\n\nFirst part: [0,4,0,0]\n\nReplace zeros:\n\ni=0:0 \u2192 input5=0 \u2192 remains0?\n\nWait, but according to this rule, replace with input[5+i], but if that's also zero, it stays zero. But the actual output is [0,4,9,9]. Let's see:\n\ni=0: input5=0 \u2192 replace with0 \u2192 remains0\n\ni=1:4 \u2192 stays4\n\ni=2:0 \u2192 input5+2=7 \u21929 \u2192 becomes9\n\ni=3:0 \u2192 input5+3=8 \u21929 \u2192 becomes9\n\nSo output is [0,4,9,9], which matches.\n\nExample0's third input:\n\nFirst part: [4,0,0,0]\n\nReplace zeros:\n\ni=0:4 \u2192 stays\n\ni=1:0 \u2192 input5+1=6 \u21920 \u2192 becomes0?\n\nBut output is [4,1,1,0]. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the input for Example0's third input is [4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0]. The second part starts at position5:0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0.\n\nSo for i=0:4 \u2192 stay.\n\ni=1:0 \u2192 input5+1=6 \u21920 \u2192 replace with0 \u2192 remains0.\n\ni=2:0 \u2192 input5+2=7 \u21920 \u2192 remains0.\n\ni=3:0 \u2192 input5+3=8 \u21920 \u2192 remains0.\n\nOutput should be [4,0,0,0], but actual output is [4,1,1,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this hypothesis works for the first two examples but not the third.\n\nBut wait, maybe the rule is different. Maybe after the 2 (position4), the elements are considered starting from position4+1=5, but perhaps the replacement uses elements from position6 onwards, or some other offset. Or perhaps the replacement uses elements from position4+1+i.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement elements are taken from the second part after position4, but considering the entire array, and if the element in the first part is zero, it's replaced with the first non-zero element from the second part, in order.\n\nFor example, in Example0's third input:\n\nFirst part [4,0,0,0]. Zeros at positions1,2,3.\n\nSecond part elements:0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0. The non-zeros are2,1.\n\nSo replace the first zero in first part (position1) with2. Second zero (position2) with1. Third zero (position3) with0 (since no more non-zeros). So output would be [4,2,1,0]. But actual output is [4,1,1,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement uses the first four non-zero elements in the second part. For Example0's third input, the second part has non-zeros at positions8 (2?), 10 (1), etc. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nAnother observation: Looking at Example0's third input's output [4,1,1,0], the input's second part (after 2) is [0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0]. So the first non-zero in the second part is2 at position8 (original input position8). Then next non-zero is1 at position10. So output could be [4,2,1,0]. But actual output is [4,1,1,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output's elements are [4,1,1,0]. The 1s are from position10 and11. So perhaps the output is taking elements from the first part and certain positions after the second part.\n\nIn Example0's third input:\n\nFirst part: [4,0,0,0]. Output is [4,1,1,0]. So 4 is from first part's first element. 1s are from positions10 and11. 0 is from position13. So perhaps the output is [first part's first element, position10, position11, position13]. For this input, yes: 4,1,1,0. Which matches. Let's check if this applies to other examples.\n\nExample0's first input's output: [9,4,0,4]. positions10,11,13 are0,0,0. So this would require the output to be [something,0,0,0], which doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by taking the first part's first element, then the first three non-zero elements from the second part. \n\nExample0's first input's second part has 9,9,0,0,2,0,0,0,0. First three non-zero are9,9,2. So output would be [0,9,9,2]. But actual output is [9,4,0,4]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, first element of output is first non-zero in second part, then first three elements of first part. For Example0's first input:9, 0,4,0 \u2192 [9,0,4,0]. No.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the test input and try to find the pattern based on the examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,4,0,2,9,0,9,0,2,1,1,0,0]\n\n[4,4,0,4,2,9,9,9,0,2,1,1,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,0,9,9,9,2,1,1,0,1]\n\n[0,4,4,0,2,9,0,9,9,2,1,0,0,0]\n\nEach input array has 14 elements. The output should be four elements for each.\n\nLet's try applying the earlier hypothesis where each output element is formed by taking the first part's elements (0-3) and replacing any zeros with elements from the second part starting at position5+i. Let's apply this to the first test input.\n\nFirst test input array:\n\n[0,0,4,0,2,9,0,9,0,2,1,1,0,0]\n\nFirst part: positions0-3: [0,0,4,0]\n\nSecond part starts at position5:9,0,9,0,2,1,1,0,0.\n\nFor each element in first part:\n\ni=0:0 \u2192 replace with position5+0=5 \u21929 \u2192 becomes9\n\ni=1:0 \u2192 position5+1=6 \u21920 \u2192 becomes0\n\ni=2:4 \u2192 stays4\n\ni=3:0 \u2192 position5+3=8 \u21920 \u2192 becomes0\n\nSo output would be [9,0,4,0]. But let's check the training examples for similar cases.\n\nLooking at Example0's third input, which follows this pattern but doesn't match the output. So this hypothesis is likely incorrect.\n\nBut wait, the test input's first array's output would be [9,0,4,0] according to this rule, but we need to check if this matches the training examples' pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace zeros in the first part with the elements from the second part, but starting from the beginning of the second part, in order. For example:\n\nFirst test input's first part: [0,0,4,0]. Second part starts with9,0,9,0,2,1,1,0,0.\n\nWe have three zeros in the first part. The first zero is replaced with9 (first element of second part), the second zero with0 (second element of second part), the fourth zero with9 (third element of second part). So output would be [9,0,4,9]. But I don't know if this matches any training examples.\n\nAlternatively, the zeros in the first part are replaced by the first four elements of the second part, regardless of their value. So first part becomes:\n\n[9 (from position5), 0 (position6),4 (no replacement),0 (position8)] \u2192 [9,0,4,0].\n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples?\n\nLet's check Example0's third input:\n\nFirst part: [4,0,0,0]. Second part starts with0,0,0,0. So replacing zeros with second part's elements:\n\n[4,0,0,0]. But output is [4,1,1,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is not working.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0's third input, the output is [4,1,1,0]. The first part is [4,0,0,0], and the second part has elements [0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0]. The output's 1s come from position10 and11 of the input. So maybe the output is formed by elements from the first part and elements from the latter part of the input.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by taking the first element after the 2 (position5), then the first part's elements 1,2,3.\n\nFor Example0's first input: position5 is9, elements1,2,3 are4,0,4 \u2192 [9,4,0,4]. Which matches.\n\nSecond input: position5 is0, elements1,2,3 are4,0,0 \u2192 [0,4,0,0]. Actual output [0,4,9,9]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. But for the first test input, this would give:\n\nPosition5 is9, elements1,2,3 are0,4,0 \u2192 output [9,0,4,0]. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions of the output elements in the input arrays across all training examples. For instance, in Example0's first output [9,4,0,4], the elements are from positions5,1,2,3. In Example0's second output [0,4,9,9], elements from positions5,1,7,8. In Example0's third output [4,1,1,0], elements from positions0,10,11,13. Example0's fourth output [4,4,4,4] from positions0-3.\n\nThis suggests that there's no consistent positions being used. Therefore, the pattern must be more complex.\n\nAlternative idea: The output elements are the first non-zero element from the second part, then the first three elements of the first part.\n\nExample0's first input:9, then0,4,0 \u2192 [9,0,4,0]. Doesn't match output [9,4,0,4].\n\nNo. Hmm.\n\nAfter struggling for a while, let's try to find another pattern. Let's look at the test input's first array:\n\nInput: [0,0,4,0,2,9,0,9,0,2,1,1,0,0]\n\nThe output should be four elements. Let's see what the training examples would suggest. For instance, in Example0's first output, the first element is9 (from position5), then the first part's elements1,2,3. So [9,0,4,0]. But how does this fit?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be [9,0,9,0], taking elements5,6,7,8. Which are9,0,9,0. But this is four elements, but the actual output may differ.\n\nLooking at Example1's first input:\n\nInput: [4,4,4,4,2,9,0,9,0,2,0,0,0,1]\n\nOutput: [4,4,4,4]. So elements0-3.\n\nBut according to the previous hypothesis, it should take elements5,1,2,3. So 9,4,4,4 \u2192 [9,4,4,4], which doesn't match the output. So this is incorrect.\n\nAnother observation: The output arrays often have the numbers from the first part and numbers like9 and1, which appear in the second part. Maybe the output is the first part, with any zero elements replaced by the first non-zero elements encountered in the second part, in order.\n\nExample0's first input:\n\nFirst part [0,4,0,4]. Zeros at0 and2. Second part's first non-zero is9. Replace first zero (0) with9. Next non-zero is9 again. Replace second zero (2) with9. So output [9,4,9,4]. Doesn't match actual output.\n\nExample0's second input: first part [0,4,0,0]. Zeros at0,2,3. Second part non-zeros are9,9. Replace first zero (0) with9. Second zero (2) with9. Third zero (3) with9. So output [9,4,9,9]. But actual output is [0,4,9,9]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe the pattern is that each output array is the first four elements of the input array, but with certain replacements based on the elements after the 2. Specifically, if the second part contains a 9, it replaces the first zero in the first part. If there's a 1 in the second part, it replaces subsequent zeros.\n\nFor example, in Example0's third input, the second part has a 1 in position10. So the first zero in the first part (position1) is replaced by1, next zero (position2) by1, and position3 remains0. So output [4,1,1,0], which matches.\n\nSimilarly, in the first test input, the second part has 9,0,9,0,2,1,1,0,0. The first zero in the first part (position0) is replaced by9, next zero (position1) by0 (from the second part), but since it's zero, maybe skip and take the next non-zero. Or replace with the first non-zero after. This is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first four elements of the input array, and for each zero in them, replace it with the first non-zero element from the second part (after 2), in the order they appear.\n\nExample0's first input: first part [0,4,0,4]. Zeros at0 and2. Second part non-zeros:9,9,2. Replace 0 with9, then 0 with9. Output [9,4,9,4]. Doesn't match actual [9,4,0,4].\n\nBut in the actual output, the third element is0, which wasn't replaced. So maybe only replace the first zero.\n\nBut in Example0's second input, first part [0,4,0,0]. Replace first zero with first non-zero from second part (9). Then third zero with next non-zero (9). Fourth zero with next (2). So output [9,4,9,9]. Actual output is [0,4,9,9]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In the training examples, the outputs often have the same numbers as the first part but with some replaced by numbers from later in the input. For example, in Example0's first output, the first 0 is replaced by 9. In Example0's second output, the third and fourth elements are replaced by 9s. In Example0's third output, the zeros after the first 4 are replaced by 1s. In Example0's fourth output, all are 4s from the first part.\n\nThis suggests that the replacement is based on the order of non-zero elements in the second part. Each non-zero in the second part replaces the next zero in the first part.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's first input: first part [0,4,0,4]. Zeros at0 and2. Second part non-zeros:9,9,2. Replace 0 at0 with9, 0 at2 with9. So output [9,4,9,4]. Doesn't match.\n\nExample0's second input: first part [0,4,0,0]. Zeros at0,2,3. Second part non-zeros:9,9,2. Replace 0\u21929, 0\u21929, 0\u21922. Output [9,4,9,2]. Actual output [0,4,9,9]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample0's third input: first part [4,0,0,0]. Zeros at1,2,3. Second part non-zeros:2,1. Replace 0\u21922, 0\u21921, 0\u21920 (no more). Output [4,2,1,0]. Actual output [4,1,1,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This approach isn't working either.\n\nAfter much trial and error, I think I need to look for another pattern. Let's consider that the output is formed by taking the elements from the input array at positions5,1,7,3.\n\nExample0's first input:\n\n5:9, 1:4,7:0,3:4 \u2192 [9,4,0,4]. Matches output.\n\nExample0's second input:\n\n5:0,1:4,7:9,3:0 \u2192 [0,4,9,0]. Actual output [0,4,9,9]. So third element matches, but fourth is9.\n\nHmm. Not quite.\n\nExample0's third input:\n\n5:0,1:0,7:0,3:0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0]. Actual output [4,1,1,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output elements are the first, fifth, ninth, and thirteenth elements of the input array. For Example0's first input:\n\n0:0,5:9,9:2,13:0 \u2192 [0,9,2,0]. Doesn't match output.\n\nNo.\n\nFinal Idea: Let's look at the test input and try to apply the pattern observed in the examples. For example, in Example0's first output, the output elements are [9,4,0,4]. The input's first part is [0,4,0,4], and the second part starts with9,9. The output's first element is9, then the first part's elements1,2,3. So 4,0,4. So output is [9,4,0,4].\n\nSimilarly, Example0's second input has output [0,4,9,9]. The first part is [0,4,0,0], and the second part starts with0,0,9,9. Output's first element is0 (from second part's first element), then 4 (first part's element1), then9 and9 (from second part's third and fourth elements).\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be: output is constructed as [element5, element1, element7, element8] of the input array.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample0's first input:\n\nelement5:9, element1:4, element7:0, element8:0 \u2192 output [9,4,0,0]. Actual output is [9,4,0,4]. So element8 is0, but output's fourth element is4. So no.\n\nExample0's second input:\n\nelement5:0, element1:4, element7:9, element8:9 \u2192 output [0,4,9,9]. Which matches.\n\nThird input:\n\nelement5:0, element1:0, element7:0, element8:0 \u2192 output [0,0,0,0]. Actual output [4,1,1,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nFourth input:\n\nelement5:9, element1:4, element7:0, element8:9 \u2192 output [9,4,0,9]. Actual output [4,4,4,4]. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this works for some examples but not all.\n\nAnother Observation: The outputs often have the same elements as the first part but with the first element replaced by a value from the second part. For example, Example0's first output replaces the first element with9. Example0's second output replaces the third and fourth elements with9s. Example0's third output replaces the second and third elements with1s. Example0's fourth output leaves all elements as4s.\n\nThis suggests that the output is the first part, but the first zero is replaced by the first non-zero from the second part, and subsequent zeros are replaced by subsequent non-zeros.\n\nExample0's third input: first part [4,0,0,0]. Second part non-zeros:2,1. Replace the first zero (element1) with2, next zero (element2) with1, next zero (element3) with0 (no more non-zeros). Output [4,2,1,0]. Actual output [4,1,1,0]. So doesn't fit.\n\nBut in actual output, element1 is1. So perhaps the replacement starts from a certain position in the second part.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement uses the non-zero elements from the second part in reverse order.\n\nExample0's third input's second part non-zeros:2,1. Reverse order:1,2. Replace zeros in first part: [4,1,2,0]. Doesn't fit output [4,1,1,0].\n\nNo.\n\nAt this point, I think I've exhausted my options. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess based on the examples. The pattern seems to involve taking elements from the second part (after the 2) and combining them with elements from the first part. \n\nLooking at the test input's first array:\n\n[0,0,4,0,2,9,0,9,0,2,1,1,0,0]\n\nThe first part is [0,0,4,0]. The second part starts with9,0,9,0,2,1,1,0,0.\n\nFollowing some examples where the output starts with the first non-zero in the second part and then elements from the first part, the output might be [9,0,4,9]. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, based on Example0's first output, the output could be [9,0,4,0]. But I need to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think the pattern is to take the first four elements after the 2 (positions5-8) and use them as the output. However, in Example0's first input, positions5-8 are9,9,0,0 \u2192 output [9,9,0,0], but actual output is [9,4,0,4]. Doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll make a guess that the output for the test input is derived by taking elements from positions5,1,7,8 of each input array.\n\nTest input's first array:\n\npositions5:9,1:0,7:9,8:0 \u2192 [9,0,9,0].\n\nSecond array:\n\npositions5:9,1:4,7:9,8:0 \u2192 [9,4,9,0].\n\nThird array:\n\npositions5:0,1:0,7:9,8:9 \u2192 [0,0,9,9].\n\nFourth array:\n\npositions5:9,1:4,7:9,8:9 \u2192 [9,4,9,9].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't fit. For example, Example0's third input's positions5:0,1:0,7:0,8:0 \u2192 output [0,0,0,0], but actual output is [4,1,1,0].\n\nThus, this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAfter extensive analysis and not finding a clear pattern, I'll make a guess based on the examples where the output seems to be the first four elements of the input array, but with certain elements replaced by values from the second part. For the test input:\n\nFirst input array: [0,0,4,0,2,9,0,9,0,2,1,1,0,0]. Output might be [9,0,4,9].\n\nSecond array: [4,4,0,4,2,9,9,9,0,2,1,1,1,0]. Output [9,4,9,9].\n\nThird array: [0,0,0,0,2,0,9,9,9,2,1,1,0,1]. Output [9,0,9,9].\n\nFourth array: [0,4,4,0,2,9,0,9,9,2,1,0,0,0]. Output [9,4,9,9].\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given the examples, the correct answer is likely:\n\n[9,0,4,9]\n\n[9,4,9,9]\n\n[9,0,9,9]\n\n[9,4,9,9]\n\nBut I'm unsure. Given the examples, I'll go with the pattern where the output is formed by taking elements from positions5,1,7,8 of the input array. Thus, the test output would be:\n\nFor the first test input:\n\n[9,0,9,0]\n\nSecond:\n\n[9,4,9,0]\n\nThird:\n\n[0,0,9,9]\n\nFourth:\n\n[9,4,9,9]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't always fit. However, given the time I have, I'll proceed with this hypothesis.",
