        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are these training examples with input and output matrices. My job is to see how the input is transformed into the output and apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input starts with some numbers and then zeros. The output seems to repeat the non-zero numbers in a cycle. Like the first row is [2,8,3,2,8,3,2]. The original input starts with [2,8,3,0,...], so maybe the zeros are filled by repeating the sequence 2,8,3. Each subsequent row shifts the sequence. The second row of output is [8,3,2,8,...], which starts with the second element of the previous sequence. So it looks like each row is a shifted version of the previous, cycling through the non-zero elements from the input.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 1, 2, 4 sequence towards the bottom. The output rows cycle through 2,4,1,2,4,1,2. Wait, but the input's last non-zero elements are 1,2,4. So maybe the pattern is taking the non-zero elements from the input (starting from the first non-zero?), reversing them, or some order, then cycling through. Hmm, in the output for Example 1, the sequence is 2,4,1. The input's bottom rows have 1,2,4. So perhaps the non-zero elements are reversed or rotated. Wait, the input in example 1's last row is [0,0,1,2,4,0,0], so the non-zero sequence is 1,2,4. But the output sequence starts with 2,4,1. So maybe the pattern is taking the non-zero elements and shifting them. Like 1,2,4 becomes 2,4,1? Or maybe there's a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe the process is to take all the non-zero elements in the input matrix, arrange them in the order they appear when read from the bottom-right upwards, and then cycle through that sequence. Let me check.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input: the non-zero elements are 2,8,3 in the first row. The output cycles 2,8,3,2,8,3,2. So that's exactly the sequence repeated. Then each subsequent row starts with the next element. Like row 0 starts with 2, row 1 starts with 8 (the second element), row 2 starts with 3 (third), then row 3 starts with 2 again (cycle back). That's a cyclic shift for each row. So the pattern is that each row is a shifted version of the previous, cycling through the original non-zero sequence.\n\nIn Example 1, the non-zero elements in the input are 1, then in the next row 1,2, then 1,2,4, etc. Wait, the input's non-zero elements start from the bottom. Let's list them. The non-zero elements in the input of example1:\n\nLooking at the input for example1:\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 1\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,1,2] \u21921,2\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,1,2,4] \u21921,2,4\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,1,2,4,0] \u21921,2,4\n\nRow6: [0,0,1,2,4,0,0] \u21921,2,4\n\nSo the non-zero elements when read from the bottom up (since the non-zeros are in lower rows) would be 1,2,4. But the output sequence is 2,4,1. Wait, the output for example1 starts with 2,4,1. So that's a rotation of the non-zero sequence. Maybe the pattern is to take the non-zero elements, reverse them, and then cycle through. For example, 1,2,4 becomes 4,2,1, but in the output it's 2,4,1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the order is determined by the first occurrence of each number in the input.\n\nWait in example1, the numbers in the input are 1,2,4. The output cycles 2,4,1. So perhaps the order is 2,4,1. How does that relate to the input? Let's see. The first occurrence of a non-zero in the input is row2's last element 1. Then row3 has 1,2. Then row4 has 1,2,4. So the order in which the numbers first appear is 1, then 2, then 4. But the output sequence is 2,4,1. That's a different order. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero elements are collected in a specific order. Maybe from the bottom-right upwards. Let's look at example1's input. The first non-zero in the input is the 1 in row2 (third row from the top) last element. Then in row3, the last two elements are 1 and 2. In row4, the last three are 1,2,4. So the non-zero elements are in a diagonal pattern from bottom to top. So if we collect all the non-zero elements in the order they appear along this diagonal, maybe starting from the bottom-right and moving up-left. Let's try that.\n\nFor example1, the non-zero elements in the input are arranged in a diagonal-like pattern. Let's list them:\n\nLooking at the input rows from bottom to top (since the non-zeros are in the lower part):\n\nRow6 (bottom row): [0,0,1,2,4,0,0] \u2192 1,2,4\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,1,2,4,0] \u21921,2,4\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,1,2,4] \u21921,2,4\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,1,2] \u21921,2\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1] \u21921\n\nSo the non-zero elements, when read from the bottom to the top and left to right in each row, would be 1,2,4 (from row6), then 1,2,4 (row5), but maybe only unique values? Or perhaps the sequence is formed by the first occurrence of each new number. Let's see. The first occurrence is 1 in row2, then 2 appears in row3, then 4 in row4. So the order is 1,2,4. But the output sequence is 2,4,1. So that's a different order. Wait, maybe the order is 4,2,1 reversed? No, the output sequence is 2,4,1. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the non-zero elements are read in reverse order. For example, in example1, the non-zero elements are 1,2,4. If reversed, it's 4,2,1. But the output sequence is 2,4,1. That doesn't fit. \n\nWait, looking at the output of example1:\n\nThe output rows start with [2,4,1,2,4,1,2], then next row starts with 4, then 1, then 2 again. So the repeating cycle is 2,4,1. So the cycle length is 3. So the non-zero elements in the input are 1,2,4. How does 1,2,4 become the cycle 2,4,1? Maybe the order is taken from the first occurrence of each number when moving from the first non-zero in the input. Let's see in example1, the first non-zero is in row2 (third row) at position 6 (0-based index 6). The value is 1. Then in row3, position 5 is 1, position6 is 2. Then row4: position4 is1, position5 is 2, position6 is4. So the order in which numbers appear as we move from the first occurrence is 1, then 2, then 4. But the output cycle is 2,4,1. So perhaps there's a shift involved here. For example, the sequence is 1,2,4, and the cycle starts with 2. So 2,4,1. Which is the same as taking the sequence 1,2,4 and rotating left by one (so 2,4,1). Because 2 comes after 1 in the original sequence. Wait, no. Original sequence is 1,2,4. Rotating left once would give 2,4,1. Yes. So perhaps the cycle is formed by rotating the original non-zero elements once to the left. \n\nSo in example0, the non-zero elements are [2,8,3]. Rotating left once would be 8,3,2. But the output cycle is 2,8,3. Wait, example0's output starts with 2,8,3,2,8,3,2. So the cycle is 2,8,3. Which is the original order, not rotated. Hmm, that contradicts. So maybe the rotation idea is not correct.\n\nWait, example0's input is [2,8,3,0,...], so the non-zero sequence is [2,8,3]. The output cycle is exactly that, repeated. So why in example1 it's different? The input's non-zero elements are 1,2,4. The output cycle is 2,4,1. So how does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cycle is the non-zero elements but starting from the second element. So for example0: [2,8,3] \u2192 start at 2, cycle as normal. But for example1, [1,2,4] \u2192 starting at 2? How would that happen? Let's see. Maybe the cycle is determined by the order of the last occurrence of the elements. Or maybe the cycle is determined by the diagonal elements.\n\nLooking at example2's input. The input has non-zero elements in a diagonal pattern. Let's see:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,8,3,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,8,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,8,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,8,3,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow4: [8,3,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nRow5: [3,0,0,0,4,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,4,0,0,0]\n\nSo the non-zero elements here are 8,3,4. Wait, row3 has 4 at the end, row4 has 4, row5 has 4. Wait, but the non-zero elements are 8,3,4. But the output sequence is 4,8,3,4,8,3,4. So the cycle is 4,8,3. How does that come from the input's non-zero elements?\n\nLooking at the input's non-zero elements, perhaps the order is 8,3,4. Then rotated left once gives 3,4,8. No, output is 4,8,3. Hmm. Alternatively, the order is determined by the first occurrence in the input. The first non-zero element in example2's input is 8 in row0. Then 3 in row0. Then in row3, 4. So the order is 8,3,4. But output cycle is 4,8,3. So again, rotated right by two steps? Or maybe the order is reversed. 8,3,4 reversed is 4,3,8. Not matching. Or perhaps the sequence is 4,8,3. How does that come from the input?\n\nWait, perhaps the non-zero elements are collected in a specific order. For example, in example0, the non-zero elements are in the first row. For example2, the non-zero elements form a diagonal pattern. Let's track their positions. The 8 in row0, column4. Then in row1, column3:8, column4:3. Row2: column2:8, column3:3. Row3: column1:8, column2:3, column6:4. Row4: column0:8, column1:3, column5:4. Row5: column0:3, column4:4. Row6: column3:4. So the non-zero elements are 8,3,4. But how are they ordered?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is built by the first occurrence of each new number. The first occurrence in example2 is 8 (row0, column4), then 3 (row0, column5), then 4 (row3, column6). So the order is 8,3,4. But the output cycle is 4,8,3. So again, the output starts with 4, which is the last element of the input's non-zero sequence. So maybe the cycle is the reverse of the non-zero elements. 8,3,4 reversed is 4,3,8. But the output is 4,8,3. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern involves combining the non-zero elements from all the input rows, but ordered from the end to the beginning. For example, in example1's input, the non-zero elements are 1,2,4. If arranged as 4,2,1, then the cycle would be 4,2,1, but the output is 2,4,1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs of all examples. Each output is a matrix where each row is a shifted version of the previous row, cycling through a fixed sequence. The sequence is different for each example. For example0: [2,8,3], example1: [2,4,1], example2: [4,8,3]. So the sequence is three elements long each time. The input must determine what that three-element sequence is.\n\nSo how to get the sequence from the input?\n\nIn example0, the input's first row is [2,8,3,0,...]. The non-zero elements are 2,8,3. The output sequence is the same: 2,8,3.\n\nIn example1, the input's non-zero elements are 1,2,4. The output sequence is 2,4,1. So that's 2,4,1. Which is the same as the elements ordered 2,4,1. How does that come from the input? The input's non-zero elements are 1, then 2, then 4. So maybe the sequence is the last three non-zero elements in the input. But in example1, the last non-zero elements are 1,2,4. But the output sequence is 2,4,1. Hmm, perhaps it's a rotation of the elements.\n\nIf the non-zero elements in the input are 1,2,4, then the sequence in the output is 2,4,1, which is a left rotation by one. Because 2 is next after 1 in the original order. Wait, no. Original order is 1,2,4. Rotating left once would give 2,4,1. Exactly the output sequence. So in example1, the sequence is a left rotation of the input's non-zero elements.\n\nIn example0, the input's non-zero elements are 2,8,3. If we rotate left once, we get 8,3,2. But the output sequence is 2,8,3. So that doesn't fit. So why is example0's sequence not rotated? Or perhaps the rotation depends on something else.\n\nWait, maybe the sequence is the reverse of the non-zero elements. For example0: 2,8,3 \u2192 reversed is 3,8,2. No, output is 2,8,3. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is determined by the order of the last occurrence of each element in the input. For example0, all non-zero elements are in the first three rows. So the last occurrence of 2 is in row0, 8 in row1, 3 in row2. So the order is 2,8,3. Which matches the output.\n\nIn example1, the non-zero elements are 1,2,4. Their last occurrence positions: 1's last occurrence is in row6, column2. 2's last occurrence is row6, column3. 4's last occurrence is row6, column4. So the order is 1,2,4. But the output sequence is 2,4,1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is determined by the position of the first occurrence of each element in the input. For example0: 2 appears first, then 8, then 3. So sequence is 2,8,3. Which matches the output. For example1: 1 appears first, then 2, then4. So sequence would be 1,2,4. But output is 2,4,1. So that's a discrepancy. Hmm.\n\nWait, example1's output sequence is 2,4,1. But the first occurrence order is 1, then 2, then4. So maybe the order is 2,4,1. How does that happen? Maybe the sequence is formed by taking the non-zero elements but in reverse order of their first occurrence. So example1's first occurrence is 1, then 2, then4. Reverse order would be 4,2,1. But output is 2,4,1. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is the order in which the non-zero elements appear when traversing the input matrix in a specific path, such as diagonally. For example, in example0, the non-zero elements are in the first row. So traversal is straightforward. In example1, the non-zero elements form a diagonal from row2 to row6. Let's imagine reading them in a diagonal order. For example, starting from the bottom-right corner and moving up-left. \n\nIn example1's input:\n\nRow6 (bottom row): [0,0,1,2,4,0,0] \u2192 elements 1,2,4 at positions 2,3,4.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,1,2,4,0] \u2192 elements 1,2,4 at positions 3,4,5.\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,1,2,4] \u2192 elements 1,2,4 at positions4,5,6.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,1,2] \u2192 elements1,2 at 5,6.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 element1 at6.\n\nIf we collect these elements by diagonals, perhaps from the bottom-right up, but it's not clear. Alternatively, maybe reading the non-zero elements in the order they appear when the matrix is read in reverse (from bottom to top, right to left). So starting from the bottom row, right to left. Let's see:\n\nRow6 (bottom): elements are 0,0,1,2,4,0,0. Right to left: 0,0,4,2,1,0,0. So non-zero elements are4,2,1.\n\nThen row5: right to left:0,4,2,1,0,0,0 \u21924,2,1.\n\nRow4:4,2,1,0,0,0,0 \u21924,2,1.\n\nRow3:2,1,0,0,0,0,0 \u21922,1.\n\nRow2:1,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u21921.\n\nSo the non-zero elements when read this way are4,2,1, then4,2,1, etc. But the output sequence is2,4,1. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is formed by taking the unique non-zero elements in the order of their first occurrence in the input. For example0: 2,8,3. For example1:1,2,4. For example2:8,3,4. Then, perhaps the output sequence is a cyclic permutation of these elements. For example0's output sequence is the same as the input's. For example1, the output sequence is a left rotation by one (2,4,1). For example2's output sequence is4,8,3, which is a left rotation of 8,3,4. Wait, example2's input non-zero elements are 8,3,4. The output sequence is4,8,3. So that's a left rotation by two steps: 8\u21923\u21924 \u2192 but 8,3,4 left rotated once is3,4,8; rotated twice is4,8,3. So yes. So example2's sequence is a left rotation by two steps. But example1's is a left rotation by one. Example0's is not rotated. So this inconsistency is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rotation depends on the number of non-zero elements. All examples have three non-zero elements, and the rotation is by one step for example1, zero steps for example0, two steps for example2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is determined by the last occurrence of each element in the input matrix. Let's think:\n\nFor example0, the elements are 2,8,3. Each appears only in their original row. So last occurrence order is 2 (row0),8 (row1),3 (row2). So sequence is2,8,3. Which matches the output.\n\nFor example1, elements are1,2,4. Their last occurrences:\n\n1 appears last in row6, column2.\n\n2 appears last in row6, column3.\n\n4 appears last in row6, column4.\n\nSo the order is1,2,4. But the output sequence is2,4,1. So this doesn't match.\n\nFor example2, the elements are8,3,4. Their last occurrences:\n\n8 is in row4, column0.\n\n3 is in row5, column0.\n\n4 is in row6, column3.\n\nOrder would be8,3,4. But output sequence is4,8,3. So not matching.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the output matrices. Each row is a shifted version of the previous. For example0:\n\nRow0:2,8,3,2,8,3,2\n\nRow1:8,3,2,8,3,2,8 \u2192 shifted left by one from row0.\n\nRow2:3,2,8,3,2,8,3 \u2192 shifted left by one from row1.\n\nRow3:2,8,3,2,8,3,2 \u2192 same as row0.\n\nSo the pattern is that each row starts with the next element in the sequence, wrapping around.\n\nSo the sequence is [2,8,3]. For row0, start with index0:2. Row1 starts with index1:8. Row2 starts with index2:3. Row3 starts with index0 again:2. And so on.\n\nSo the sequence is the same as the initial non-zero elements in the input. So for example0, the sequence is [2,8,3]. For example1, the sequence is [2,4,1]. For example2, the sequence is [4,8,3].\n\nNow, how to get these sequences from the input. Let's see.\n\nExample0's input has non-zero elements [2,8,3]. Output sequence is same. So the sequence is the initial non-zero elements in order.\n\nExample1's input non-zero elements are [1,2,4]. Output sequence is [2,4,1]. Which is a left rotation by one step of [1,2,4]. But why? How to decide that.\n\nExample2's input non-zero elements are [8,3,4]. Output sequence is [4,8,3]. Which is a left rotation by two steps. Or a right rotation by one step. Because rotating [8,3,4] to the right once gives [4,8,3].\n\nSo why the different rotations? What's the rule here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is determined by the elements in the input's lower-right corner. Let's look at example1's input. The last row (row6) is [0,0,1,2,4,0,0]. So the non-zero elements here are 1,2,4. But the output sequence is 2,4,1. So perhaps the sequence is the reverse of the non-zero elements in the last row. 1,2,4 reversed is4,2,1. But the output sequence is2,4,1. No. Alternatively, the last row's non-zero elements are 1,2,4, and the sequence is 2,4,1. Which is a left rotation by one.\n\nExample2's input's last row is [0,0,0,4,0,0,0]. Non-zero is4. But the output sequence is4,8,3. So that's not directly taken from the last row. However, the row before last (row5) is [3,0,0,0,4,0,0]. Non-zero elements3 and4. Row4: [8,3,0,0,0,4,0]. Non-zero elements8,3,4. So maybe the sequence is taken from the first occurrence of three non-zero elements in a row. For example2, the first row with three non-zero elements is row3: [0,8,3,0,0,0,4], which has 8,3,4. So sequence is8,3,4. But output is4,8,3. So again a right rotation by one.\n\nHmm. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nLooking at all three examples, the output sequence is a rotation of the non-zero elements from the input, but the amount of rotation varies. So how can we determine the rotation?\n\nAlternative hypothesis: The rotation is determined by the position of the first non-zero element in the input matrix.\n\nFor example0, the first non-zero is at row0, column0 (value 2). The sequence starts at 2, which is the original order. No rotation.\n\nFor example1, the first non-zero is at row2, column6 (value1). Maybe the rotation is based on the row index. Row2 (index2) modulo 3 (since sequence length is3) is2. So rotate left by2 steps. Original sequence [1,2,4]. Rotate left by2 \u2192 [4,1,2]. But the output sequence is2,4,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rotation is determined by the number of zeros before the first non-zero element in the input.\n\nIn example0, the first row starts with2, so no zeros before. So rotation is0.\n\nIn example1, the first non-zero is in row2, but in that row, the non-zero is at position6 (so six zeros before). 6 mod3=0. So no rotation. But output sequence is rotated by1.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is the non-zero elements from the input, but ordered based on their occurrence in the last row of the input that has non-zero elements.\n\nFor example1, the last non-zero row is row6, which has elements1,2,4. So the sequence is1,2,4. But output is2,4,1. So again, a left rotation by one.\n\nFor example2, the last non-zero row is row6, which has4. Previous row (row5) has3 and4. The first row with three non-zero elements is row3:8,3,4. So the sequence is8,3,4. Output is4,8,3, which is a right rotation by one.\n\nBut how to decide which row to take.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is formed by the non-zero elements in the last row that has the maximum number of non-zero elements.\n\nFor example1, the last row with non-zero elements is row6, which has three non-zero elements (1,2,4). So the sequence is1,2,4. Output is2,4,1. Left rotation by one.\n\nFor example2, the row with the maximum non-zero elements is row3 (has three non-zero:8,3,4). So sequence is8,3,4. Output is4,8,3, right rotation by one.\n\nExample0's first row has three non-zero elements. So sequence is2,8,3. No rotation.\n\nSo for each example, the sequence is taken from the first row with the maximum number of non-zero elements, ordered as they appear in that row, then rotated by one position to the right (or left) depending on the example.\n\nWait, in example0, the sequence is not rotated. example1: sequence from row6 is1,2,4. Output sequence is2,4,1. So left rotation by one. example2: sequence from row3 is8,3,4. Output sequence is4,8,3. Which is a right rotation by one (since rotating right once gives 4,8,3 from 8,3,4).\n\nHmm, this seems inconsistent. Why would example1 rotate left and example2 rotate right?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rotation is based on the row index. For example0, the row with max non-zero is row0 (index0). 0 mod3=0 \u2192 no rotation. example1's max row is row6 (index6). 6 mod3=0 \u2192 no rotation. But output is rotated. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the rotation is determined by the number of non-zero elements in the row. For example0: row0 has3 non-zero. So rotation is3-1=2 steps? No. example1's row6 has3 non-zero. 3-1=2 steps. Rotating left by2 steps on [1,2,4] gives [4,1,2], which is not the output sequence.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in example0's input, the first row has the non-zero elements. The output's sequence is the same as the input's non-zero elements.\n\nIn example1's input, the last few rows form a diagonal of non-zero elements. The output's sequence is a left rotation of the non-zero elements from the first row that has three non-zero elements. The first such row is row4 (input for example1 is row4: [0,0,0,0,1,2,4] \u2192 non-zero elements1,2,4. So sequence is1,2,4. But output is2,4,1. So left rotation by one.\n\nIn example2, the first row with three non-zero elements is row3: [0,8,3,0,0,0,4] \u2192 non-zero elements8,3,4. Output sequence is4,8,3. Which is a right rotation by one (or left rotation by two). \n\nBut why the different rotation amounts? This inconsistency is confusing. Maybe the rotation is determined by the position of the row. For example, if the row is in an even index, rotate left by one, if odd, rotate right by one. But example0's row0 (even index) has no rotation. example1's row4 (even index, 4 is even) \u2192 rotate left by one. example2's row3 (odd index) \u2192 rotate right by one. This seems possible. Let's check:\n\nExample0's row0 (even index0), sequence is same as input, no rotation. So left rotation by0.\n\nExample1's row4 (even index4), left rotate by1: [1,2,4] \u2192 [2,4,1]. Which matches output.\n\nExample2's row3 (index3, odd), right rotate by1: [8,3,4] \u2192 [4,8,3]. Which matches output.\n\nYes! This could be the pattern.\n\nSo the rule is:\n\n1. Find the first row in the input that has three non-zero elements (the maximum needed to form the 3-element cycle).\n\n2. Take the non-zero elements from that row in their order.\n\n3. If the row index is even, rotate the sequence left by one. If the row index is odd, rotate right by one.\n\nLet's verify this.\n\nExample0:\n\nFirst row with three non-zero is row0 (index0, even). Sequence is [2,8,3]. Rotate left by one \u2192 [8,3,2]. Wait, but example0's output sequence is [2,8,3]. So this contradicts. Hmm. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nWait, example0's output sequence is the same as the original sequence. So rotation by zero. But row0 is even index. According to the previous hypothesis, it should rotate left by one. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the sequence is the non-zero elements from the first row that contains non-zero elements, regardless of the count. For example0, the first row has three non-zero elements. So sequence is [2,8,3]. example1's first non-zero row is row2 with one element, then row3 with two, then row4 with three. So first row with non-zero is row2. But the sequence is taken from row4 (three elements). So perhaps the sequence is formed by taking the first three non-zero elements encountered in the input, regardless of the row.\n\nIn example0, the first three non-zero elements are2,8,3 \u2192 sequence [2,8,3].\n\nIn example1, the first three non-zero elements are1 (row2), 1 (row3), 2 (row3). So sequence [1,1,2]. But output sequence is2,4,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAnother idea: The output sequence is the unique non-zero elements in the order they appear when reading the input matrix from bottom to top, right to left. \n\nExample1's input, when read bottom to top, right to left:\n\nRow6 (bottom): 0,0,1,2,4,0,0 \u2192 right to left:0,0,4,2,1,0,0 \u2192 non-zero:4,2,1.\n\nRow5:0,0,0,1,2,4,0 \u2192 right to left:0,4,2,1,0,0,0 \u2192 non-zero:4,2,1.\n\nRow4:0,0,0,0,1,2,4 \u2192 right to left:4,2,1,0,0,0,0 \u2192 non-zero:4,2,1.\n\nRow3:0,0,0,0,0,1,2 \u2192 right to left:2,1,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 non-zero:2,1.\n\nRow2:0,0,0,0,0,0,1 \u2192 right to left:1,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 non-zero:1.\n\nSo the non-zero elements encountered in this order are4,2,1,4,2,1,4,2,1,2,1,1. The unique elements in order are4,2,1. But the output sequence is2,4,1. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, unique elements in the order of first occurrence when read this way:4,2,1. So output sequence would be4,2,1. But actual output is2,4,1.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Looking at the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nLooking at this, the non-zero elements are1,2,4. The first non-zero in the first row is1, then in the first row also 2. In the second row,1 and2. Then in the last row,2 and4. So the non-zero elements are1,2,4.\n\nIn the previous examples, the output sequence seems to be a rotation of these elements. For example1's input had1,2,4 and output was2,4,1 (left rotate once). The test input's non-zero elements are1,2,4. If the pattern is to left rotate once, the output sequence would be2,4,1. Then each row would shift left by one. So the first row would start with2, then4,1,2,4,1,2. Second row starts with4, then1,2,4, etc.\n\nLooking at the test input's output, if the sequence is2,4,1, then the first row of the output would be [2,4,1,2,4,1,2]. But looking at the training examples, the first row of the output starts with the first element of the sequence, then cycles. So for the test input, applying the same pattern as example1 (left rotate once), the output would have the same sequence as example1's output.\n\nBut let's look at example2. Its input non-zero elements were8,3,4. Output sequence was4,8,3. Which is a right rotation once. So why the difference? Is there a reason why example1's sequence is left rotated and example2's is right rotated?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction of rotation depends on the position of the first non-zero element in the input. For example, if the first non-zero element is in an even column, rotate left; if odd, rotate right. Or something like that.\n\nIn example1's input, the first non-zero element is in row2, column6. Column6 is even (since it's 0-based). So maybe even column \u2192 left rotate. example0's first non-zero is column0, even \u2192 no rotation? Or example0's first non-zero is row0, column0, even \u2192 left rotate once? But example0's output sequence is the same as the input sequence, which would imply no rotation. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of non-zero elements in the row determines the rotation. For example, if a row has three non-zero elements, then rotate based on some rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rotation is such that the last element of the input sequence becomes the first in the output sequence. For example, in example1's input sequence [1,2,4], last element is4. Output sequence starts with2, then4. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence is determined by the non-zero elements in the input's first diagonal. For example, in example1, the diagonal elements from the bottom-right upwards are4,2,1. Which matches the output sequence2,4,1. No, the sequence would be4,2,1, but output is2,4,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the key is to look for the pattern in the output sequences and see if there's a relation to the input's non-zero elements. For example, in example1, the output sequence is2,4,1. The input's non-zero elements are1,2,4. The output sequence is a permutation of these elements. The same for example0 and example2.\n\nSo perhaps the output sequence is the non-zero elements ordered as follows: the second element, then third, then first. Let's see:\n\nExample0: non-zero elements2,8,3. Second is8, third is3, first is2. So sequence8,3,2. But output sequence is2,8,3. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1: non-zero1,2,4. Second element2, third4, first1. So sequence2,4,1. Which matches the output.\n\nExample2: non-zero8,3,4. Second3, third4, first8. Sequence3,4,8. But output sequence is4,8,3. So doesn't fit.\n\nSo for example1, this works, but not for others. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output sequence is the non-zero elements in reverse order. Example0:3,8,2. Output is2,8,3. No. example1:4,2,1. Output is2,4,1. No.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the output sequence is built by taking the non-zero elements from the input and arranging them such that each element is followed by the next non-zero element in the input. For example, in example1's input, the non-zero elements appear in the order1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1,2,4, etc. But the unique elements are1,2,4. The output sequence is2,4,1. So perhaps the order is determined by the sequence in which they first appear after the first occurrence. Like after the first 1 comes 2, then after 2 comes4, then after4 comes1. So the cycle is2,4,1.\n\nBut how to determine this from the input. It's not clear.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern that can be applied to the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe non-zero elements are1,2,4. Let's see where they appear.\n\nFirst non-zero in the input is in row0, column1 (value1), then row0 column6 (2). Then row1 column0 (1), row1 column5 (2). Then row2 column4 (2). Row3 column3 (2). Row4 column2 (2). Row5 column1 (2), row5 column6 (4). Row6 column0 (2), row6 column5 (4).\n\nSo the non-zero elements are1,2,4. The first occurrences are1 (row0, column1), 2 (row0, column6), 4 (row5, column6).\n\nSo the order of first occurrence is1,2,4. So the sequence should be a permutation of these. If the pattern is like example1 (left rotation once), the sequence would be2,4,1. Then the output matrix would cycle through this sequence with each row shifted left.\n\nSo applying this to the test input, the output would start with2,4,1,2,4,1,2 for the first row.\n\nThen the second row starts with4, then1,2,4, etc.\n\nThe third row starts with1, then2,4, etc.\n\nSo the matrix would look like:\n\n[2,4,1,2,4,1,2]\n\n[4,1,2,4,1,2,4]\n\n[1,2,4,1,2,4,1]\n\n[2,4,1,2,4,1,2]\n\n[4,1,2,4,1,2,4]\n\n[1,2,4,1,2,4,1]\n\n[2,4,1,2,4,1,2]\n\nBut wait, let's check if this matches any of the training examples' structure. For example, example1's output is:\n\n[2,4,1,2,4,1,2]\n\n[4,1,2,4,1,2,4]\n\n[1,2,4,1,2,4,1]\n\n[2,4,1,2,4,1,2]\n\n[4,1,2,4,1,2,4]\n\n[1,2,4,1,2,4,1]\n\n[2,4,1,2,4,1,2]\n\nYes. So the test input's non-zero elements are1,2,4, same as example1. So the output would follow the same pattern as example1, resulting in the same cycle sequence2,4,1. Hence, the test output should be similar to example1's output, but with the same sequence.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 7x7 grid of numbers, and the output is another 7x7 grid. My job is to find out how the input is transformed into the output. Let's start by examining the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has the first three rows starting with [2,8,3], then all zeros. The output seems to be a repetition of the sequence 2,8,3,2,8,3,2 in the first row. The next row starts with 8,3,2 and repeats 8,3,2, etc. It looks like each row is a shifted version of the previous, creating a kind of diagonal pattern. But wait, how does that relate to the input? The input's non-zero elements are at the beginning of the first three rows, maybe they're forming a pattern that's then extended periodically?\n\nLooking at the output for Example 0, the sequence 2,8,3 repeats every three elements. But the output rows are of length 7, so it's 2,8,3,2,8,3,2. Then the next row starts with 8,3,2, and so on. So maybe the pattern is taking the initial non-zero elements from the input and using them as a cycle that's repeated and shifted in each row.\n\nNow Example 1's input has a 1, then 1,2, then 1,2,4 building up in a diagonal from the bottom. The output starts with 2,4,1 and repeats this sequence. The first row of the output is [2,4,1,2,4,1,2], then the next starts with 4,1,2, etc. So the cycle here is 2,4,1. Wait, how does that relate to the input? The input's non-zero elements in the last few rows are 1, 2, 4. So maybe the cycle is 1,2,4, but in reverse? Because the output cycle is 2,4,1. Hmm, not sure. Or perhaps the cycle is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input, starting from the bottom right and moving up. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the non-zero elements start at the third row (from the bottom) as 1, then next row 1,2, then 1,2,4. So the sequence is 1,2,4. But the output cycle is 2,4,1. So maybe the cycle is 1,2,4, but rotated. Like shifting them. If we take 1,2,4 and rotate left by one position, we get 2,4,1. That matches the output's cycle. So perhaps the pattern is taking the non-zero elements from the input, arranging them in a sequence, then rotating left by one to form the cycle, and then tiling the grid with that cycle in a way that each row is shifted by one from the previous.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has elements like 8,3,0,0,0,4 in some rows. The output's cycle is 4,8,3. Looking at the input's non-zero elements, perhaps the sequence is 8,3,4. If we rotate left once, 8,3,4 becomes 3,4,8. But the output's cycle is 4,8,3. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the input for Example 2. The input has rows starting with 0,0,0,0,8,3,0, then next row 0,0,0,8,3,0,0, etc. Then in the fourth row, there's a 4 at the end. So the non-zero elements are 8,3,4. If we rotate left once, 8,3,4 would become 3,4,8, but the output's cycle is 4,8,3. That's a different rotation. Alternatively, maybe the sequence is 4,8,3. How do they get that?\n\nWait, in the input of Example 2, the last element of the fourth row is 4. Then the fifth row has 4 as the sixth element, and the sixth row's last element is 4. So maybe the non-zero elements are 8,3,4. But the output cycle is 4,8,3. So perhaps the sequence is reversed? 4,3,8? No, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the non-zero elements are collected in reverse order. Let me think. Let's look at all non-zero elements in the input grid for Example 2. The first row has 8,3. The fourth row has 4. Then fifth row has 4. Sixth row's last element is 4. Wait, perhaps the non-zero elements in order are 8,3,4. Then the cycle is 8,3,4. But the output cycle starts with 4,8,3. So that's rotating right once? Because 8,3,4 rotated right once (taking the last element to the front) becomes 4,8,3. Yes! So maybe the pattern is taking the non-zero elements from the input, ordered as they appear, then rotating the sequence so that the last element comes first, creating the cycle, and then tiling each row with that cycle in a way that each subsequent row starts with the next element in the cycle.\n\nSo the general steps could be:\n\n1. Extract all non-zero elements from the input grid, in the order they appear (row-wise, left to right, top to bottom).\n2. Rotate this sequence to the right by one position (so the last element becomes the first).\n3. Then, generate each row of the output by starting with the next element in the rotated sequence and repeating the cycle.\n\nWait, let's check this with Example 0. The non-zero elements are 2,8,3,8,3,3. Wait, but the input for Example 0 is:\n\nRow 0: [2,8,3,0,...] \u2192 non-zero: 2,8,3\n\nRow 1: [8,3,0,...] \u2192 8,3\n\nRow 2: [3,0,...] \u2192 3\n\nOthers are zeros. So the non-zero elements in order are 2,8,3,8,3,3. But the output cycle is 2,8,3. Hmm, maybe it's taking the unique elements in the order they first appear. Because the non-zero elements are 2,8,3, and then repeating 8 and 3 again. But the output cycle is 2,8,3. So perhaps the unique elements, ordered as first occurrence, form the base sequence, then rotated once to the right. Wait, in Example 0, the sequence is 2,8,3. Rotated right once would give 3,2,8. But the output's cycle starts with 2,8,3. So that's not matching. Wait, the output for Example 0 is:\n\n[2,8,3,2,8,3,2]\n\nSo the cycle is 2,8,3. Then the next row starts with 8,3,2. So it's shifted left by one each time. So the cycle is 2,8,3, and each row starts with the next element in the cycle. So row 0 starts with 2, row 1 with 8, row 2 with 3, row 3 with 2 again, etc. So the starting index for each row is row_number modulo 3 (since the cycle length is 3). But how does that connect to the input?\n\nAh, maybe the input's non-zero elements form the initial cycle. For Example 0, the non-zero elements are 2,8,3, which is exactly the cycle. Then in the output, each row is shifted left by the row index. For example, row 0 starts at position 0 of the cycle, row 1 at position 1, etc. But the output cycle in Example 0 is exactly 2,8,3, so no rotation. But in Example 1, the input's non-zero elements are 1,2,4. But the output cycle is 2,4,1, which is a right rotation by one. So perhaps the pattern is that the cycle is formed by the non-zero elements of the input, ordered as they first appear, then rotated right by one. Then each row is a repetition of the cycle, starting with the element corresponding to the row index modulo cycle length.\n\nLet's test this for Example 1:\n\nInput non-zero elements (in order): starting from the third row (index 2), row 2 has a 1. Then row 3 has 1,2. Row 4 has 1,2,4. Row 5 has 1,2,4. Row 6 has 1,2,4. So the non-zero elements in order are 1 (from row 2, column 6), then 1 (row3, column5), 2 (row3, column6), then row4: 1 (col4), 2 (col5),4 (col6), etc. Wait, but perhaps the order is taken row-wise from top to bottom, left to right. Let me list all non-zero elements in the input of Example 1:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow1: all zeros.\n\nRow2: last element is 1.\n\nRow3: fifth element (0-based index 5) is 1, sixth is 2.\n\nRow4: fourth is 1, fifth is 2, sixth is4.\n\nRow5: third is1, fourth is2, fifth is4.\n\nRow6: second is1, third is2, fourth is4.\n\nSo the non-zero elements in order (row-wise, left to right, top to bottom) are:\n\nRow2: 1\n\nRow3: 1,2\n\nRow4:1,2,4\n\nRow5:1,2,4\n\nRow6:1,2,4\n\nWait, that's a lot of 1,2,4. But maybe the unique elements in the order they first appear. The first non-zero is 1 (in row2), then 2 (row3), then 4 (row4). So the unique sequence is [1,2,4]. Then rotated right by one would be [4,1,2], but the output cycle is [2,4,1]. Wait, that doesn't fit. Wait, the output cycle for Example1 starts with 2,4,1. So maybe the rotation is left by two positions? Hmm. Let me see:\n\nOriginal sequence [1,2,4]. Rotating right once gives [4,1,2]. Rotating left once gives [2,4,1]. Oh right! If you rotate left once, the first element moves to the end. So [1,2,4] rotated left once becomes [2,4,1]. Which matches the output cycle for Example1. So the pattern is:\n\nTake the non-zero elements from the input, in the order they appear (row-wise, left to right, top to bottom), collect them, remove duplicates (keeping the first occurrence), then rotate left by one to form the cycle. Then each row in the output is the cycle repeated, starting with the element corresponding to the row index modulo cycle length.\n\nWait, but in Example0, the input's non-zero elements in order are 2,8,3,8,3,3. If we take unique elements in order, it's [2,8,3]. Rotating left once gives [8,3,2]. But the output cycle starts with 2,8,3. So this doesn't fit. Hmm, contradiction here.\n\nWait, in Example0, the output's cycle is [2,8,3]. But according to the previous logic, after taking the unique elements [2,8,3] and rotating left once, we would get [8,3,2]. But the output cycle is [2,8,3]. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let's see the outputs of the examples. Each output's cycle seems to be the same as the non-zero elements in a certain order.\n\nIn Example0's output, the cycle is 2,8,3. Which matches the input's non-zero elements in the first row. The first three elements of input's row0 are 2,8,3. So maybe the cycle is taken from the first non-zero sequence in the input. For example, in Example0, the first row has non-zero elements 2,8,3, so the cycle is 2,8,3. Then, each row of the output is a shifted version of this cycle.\n\nIn Example1, the first non-zero sequence starts in row2, which is [0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. Then row3 has [0,0,0,0,0,1,2]. Row4 has [0,0,0,0,1,2,4]. So the first non-zero elements in a row are 1, then 1,2, then 1,2,4. So the first occurrence of a non-zero sequence that's longer than a single element is in row3, which is 1,2. Then row4 has 1,2,4. So maybe the cycle is the longest such initial sequence. But in the output, the cycle is 2,4,1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cycle is formed by taking all the non-zero elements in the entire input, ordered as they appear, but once, and then rotated left once. Let's test this for each example.\n\nExample0: Non-zero elements in order are 2,8,3,8,3,3. Taking unique elements gives [2,8,3]. Rotate left once \u2192 [8,3,2]. But output cycle is 2,8,3. Doesn't match.\n\nExample1: Non-zero elements in order are 1,1,2,1,2,4,1,2,4,1,2,4. Unique elements are [1,2,4]. Rotate left once \u2192 [2,4,1]. Which matches the output cycle. So in this case, it works.\n\nExample2: Input non-zero elements. Let's list them row-wise. The input for Example2 is:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,0,8,3,0 \u2192 non-zero:8,3\n\nRow1:0,0,0,8,3,0,0 \u21928,3\n\nRow2:0,0,8,3,0,0,0 \u21928,3\n\nRow3:0,8,3,0,0,0,4 \u21928,3,4\n\nRow4:8,3,0,0,0,4,0 \u21928,3,4\n\nRow5:3,0,0,0,4,0,0 \u21923,4\n\nRow6:0,0,0,4,0,0,0 \u21924\n\nSo all non-zero elements in order: 8,3,8,3,8,3,8,3,4,8,3,4,3,4,4. Unique elements in order: 8,3,4. Rotate left once \u21923,4,8. But the output cycle is 4,8,3. So that's not matching. Wait, but the output cycle for Example2 is [4,8,3]. Hmm, but according to the previous logic, if the unique elements are 8,3,4, rotated left once would be 3,4,8. But the output cycle is 4,8,3.\n\nWait, maybe instead of rotating left once, it's rotated right once. For Example1, the unique elements are [1,2,4], rotating right once gives [4,1,2]. But the output cycle is [2,4,1]. No, that's not matching. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cycle is determined by the non-zero elements in the last non-zero row of the input. Let's look at Example2. The last non-zero row is row6, which has 4. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, the input for Example2 has in row3: 8,3,0,0,0,4. So the non-zero elements there are 8,3,4. So perhaps the cycle is 8,3,4, then rotated right once becomes 4,8,3. That matches the output's cycle. So maybe the cycle is formed by taking the non-zero elements in the first row that has a longer sequence, then rotated right once.\n\nBut how to generalize this across examples?\n\nAlternatively, let's look for another pattern. The output grid seems to be a tiling of a repeating cycle, where each row starts with the next element in the cycle. For example, in Example0's output, the first row starts with 2, then 8,3,2,8,3,2. The second row starts with 8, then 3,2,8,3,2,8. So each row is shifted left by one from the previous. The cycle length here is 3. The cycle is 2,8,3. So the rows are:\n\nRow0: 2,8,3,2,8,3,2\n\nRow1:8,3,2,8,3,2,8\n\nRow2:3,2,8,3,2,8,3\n\nRow3:2,8,3,2,8,3,2 (same as row0)\n\nAnd so on. The cycle repeats every 3 rows. So the starting element for row i is cycle[(i) mod 3], and the elements are filled by repeating the cycle.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1, the cycle is 2,4,1. The rows are:\n\nRow0:2,4,1,2,4,1,2\n\nRow1:4,1,2,4,1,2,4\n\nRow2:1,2,4,1,2,4,1\n\nRow3:2,4,1,2,4,1,2 (same as row0)\n\nSo the cycle length is 3. Each row is shifted by one.\n\nIn Example2, the cycle is 4,8,3. The rows are:\n\nRow0:4,8,3,4,8,3,4\n\nRow1:8,3,4,8,3,4,8\n\nRow2:3,4,8,3,4,8,3\n\nRow3:4,8,3,4,8,3,4\n\nEtc. Cycle length 3 again.\n\nSo the key is to find the cycle, which is a sequence of three elements, and then each row is a cyclic permutation of that sequence.\n\nNow, how is this cycle determined from the input?\n\nLooking at Example0's input: the first three non-zero elements in the first row are 2,8,3. Then the cycle is 2,8,3.\n\nIn Example1's input, the non-zero elements in the lower rows form 1,2,4. The output cycle is 2,4,1, which is 1,2,4 rotated left by two positions. Wait, 1,2,4 rotated left once is 2,4,1. Which matches Example1's cycle. So maybe the cycle is the first three non-zero elements encountered in the input, ordered as they appear, then rotated left once.\n\nWait, Example0's first three non-zero elements are 2,8,3. Rotated left once would be 8,3,2. But the cycle is 2,8,3. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cycle is formed by the last three non-zero elements in the input. Let's check.\n\nFor Example1's input, the last few non-zero elements are 4 in the bottom rows. The sequence would be 1,2,4. Rotated left once gives 2,4,1. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example2's input, the non-zero elements in row3 are 8,3,4. Rotated left once gives 3,4,8. But the output's cycle is 4,8,3. That's a rotation left by two positions. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the last three non-zero elements in the entire input. For Example2, the last non-zero elements are 4 (from row6), 4 (row5, last element?), etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cycle is formed by taking the last non-zero elements from each row, or some diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example0's input, the first row has 2,8,3, followed by zeros. The output's cycle is exactly those three numbers. So the cycle is taken as the first non-zero sequence in the input.\n\nIn Example1's input, the first non-zero element is in row2 (a 1), then row3 has 1,2, then row4 has 1,2,4. So the first time a row has three non-zero elements is row4: 1,2,4. Rotating that left once gives 2,4,1, which matches the output cycle.\n\nIn Example2's input, the first row with three non-zero elements is row3: 8,3,4. Rotating left once would give 3,4,8. But the output cycle is 4,8,3. So that's rotating left twice. Hmm, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, the input for Example2's row3 is [0,8,3,0,0,0,4]. So the non-zero elements here are 8,3,4. So the first three non-zero elements in a row are 8,3,4. Rotating left once would be 3,4,8. But the output's cycle is 4,8,3. So that's rotating left twice. Hmm. This approach isn't consistent.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe the cycle is formed by the last three non-zero elements in the input. Let's check.\n\nExample0: The last non-zero elements are in row2 (3). Not enough. So perhaps this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the three non-zero elements in the input's bottom-right corner. For Example1's input, the last rows have 1,2,4 in a diagonal. The output cycle is 2,4,1. Which is a rotation. Maybe the cycle is formed by these three elements, ordered in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cycle is the reverse of the non-zero sequence. For Example0, 2,8,3 reversed is 3,8,2. But the cycle is 2,8,3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output cycle is the same as the input's non-zero elements, but arranged in a way that they form a cycle that repeats every three elements. Looking at Example2's output cycle: 4,8,3. Where do these numbers come from? In the input of Example2, there's a 4 in row3, and 8 and 3 in the earlier rows. So 8 and 3 appear multiple times, but 4 appears once. So maybe the cycle is 4,8,3. How is this determined?\n\nWait, in Example2's input, the last non-zero element is 4 in row6, but the output cycle starts with 4. Maybe the cycle is formed by taking the last non-zero elements from the input and arranging them in a certain order.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a pattern in how the output cycles relate to the input's non-zero elements:\n\nExample0:\n\nInput non-zero elements: 2,8,3,8,3,3.\n\nCycle: 2,8,3.\n\nSo the first three unique non-zero elements.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput non-zero elements: 1,1,2,1,2,4,1,2,4,1,2,4.\n\nCycle: 2,4,1 \u2192 which are the unique elements in order [1,2,4] rotated left once.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput non-zero elements: 8,3,8,3,8,3,8,3,4,8,3,4,3,4,4.\n\nUnique in order: 8,3,4.\n\nCycle:4,8,3.\n\nSo how do we get from 8,3,4 to 4,8,3? That's rotating right once. Because rotating right once moves the last element to the front: 8,3,4 \u2192 4,8,3.\n\nAh! So perhaps the cycle is formed by taking the unique non-zero elements in the order they first appear in the input, then rotated right once (i.e., moving the last element to the front).\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample0: unique elements [2,8,3]. Rotated right once \u21923,2,8. But the output cycle is 2,8,3. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1: unique elements [1,2,4]. Rotated right once \u21924,1,2. But output cycle is 2,4,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2: unique elements [8,3,4]. Rotated right once \u21924,8,3. Which matches the output cycle of Example2.\n\nHmm, this works for Example2, but not for 0 and 1. So this can't be the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's rotating left once for Examples1 and2, but not for Example0. But why?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find another angle.\n\nLooking at the output grids, each row is a shifted version of a cycle, and each row is shifted by one from the previous. So the starting element of each row cycles through the elements of the cycle. For example, in Example0's output:\n\nRow0 starts with 2 \u2192 cycle index 0.\n\nRow1 starts with 8 \u2192 index 1.\n\nRow2 starts with 3 \u2192 index 2.\n\nRow3 starts with 2 \u2192 index 0 (3 mod 3 =0).\n\nAnd so on. So the starting index is the row number mod cycle length (which is 3 in all examples).\n\nSo the cycle length is 3 in all outputs. Now, the key is to find how the cycle is determined from the input.\n\nLet's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nLooking for the non-zero elements:\n\nRow0: 1,2.\n\nRow1:1,2.\n\nRow2:2.\n\nRow3:2.\n\nRow4:2.\n\nRow5:2,4.\n\nRow6:2,4.\n\nSo the non-zero elements in order are 1,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,4. Unique elements in order:1,2,4.\n\nIf the cycle is formed by rotating left once, then [1,2,4] rotated left once becomes [2,4,1]. Then the output rows would start with:\n\nRow0:2,4,1,2,4,1,2.\n\nRow1:4,1,2,4,1,2,4.\n\nRow2:1,2,4,1,2,4,1.\n\nRow3:2,4,1,2,4,1,2.\n\nBut the expected output would be similar to the training examples, but let's see. However, looking at Example1's input, which has non-zero elements 1,2,4 and output cycle 2,4,1, which is left rotation once. So applying this to the test input's unique elements [1,2,4], rotating left once gives [2,4,1], so the cycle would be 2,4,1. Then each row starts with the cycle element based on row number mod 3.\n\nSo for the test input's output, row0 would start with 2, row1 with4, row2 with1, row3 with2, etc.\n\nBut looking at the test input's non-zero elements, the first occurrence of 1 is in row0, then 2 in row0, then 4 in row5. So the unique elements are 1,2,4.\n\nRotating left once gives [2,4,1]. So the cycle would be 2,4,1.\n\nThen, the output rows would be:\n\nRow0:2,4,1,2,4,1,2\n\nRow1:4,1,2,4,1,2,4\n\nRow2:1,2,4,1,2,4,1\n\nRow3:2,4,1,2,4,1,2\n\nRow4:4,1,2,4,1,2,4\n\nRow5:1,2,4,1,2,4,1\n\nRow6:2,4,1,2,4,1,2\n\nBut looking back at Example1's output, which has the same cycle, the pattern matches. So the test input's output should follow this pattern.\n\nThus, the answer for the test input should be:\n\n[2,4,1,2,4,1,2]\n\n[4,1,2,4,1,2,4]\n\n[1,2,4,1,2,4,1]\n\n[2,4,1,2,4,1,2]\n\n[4,1,2,4,1,2,4]\n\n[1,2,4,1,2,4,1]\n\n[2,4,1,2,4,1,2]\n\nBut let me check if this makes sense. The cycle is 2,4,1. Each row is this cycle repeated, shifted by one each row.\n\nYes. So the test input's output should follow this pattern.",
