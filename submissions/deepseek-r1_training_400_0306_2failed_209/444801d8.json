        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids based on the training examples provided. Then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nLooking at the training examples:\n\nIn Example 0, the input has a structure with 1s forming a sort of diamond or maybe a cross shape, and there's a 2 in the middle. The output seems to replace certain 0s with 2s around that central 2. Specifically, the 2 is surrounded by 0s, and in the output, those 0s become 2s, creating a sort of cross or diamond expansion. The first row in the output has a line of 2s where the input had 0s. The pattern might be that the number (like 2) in the center is expanding outward, turning adjacent 0s into its own number in some pattern.\n\nExample 1 has a similar setup but with a 3 in the lower part. The output here shows that the 3 spreads out in a cross shape as well. Similarly, the 2 in the upper part spreads as in Example 0. So maybe each number (2,3, etc.) acts as a seed, and the transformation fills the surrounding areas with that number in a certain way.\n\nExample 2 has a 6 and an 8. The outputs replace surrounding 0s with 6 and 8 respectively. So the pattern seems to be that when there's a number (non-zero and non-one), it propagates its value to adjacent cells in all four directions (up, down, left, right) but only if those cells are 0. Wait, but looking at the output, the 2 in Example 0's output creates a cross of 2s. For instance, in the input of Example 0, the 2 is at position (3,3) if rows start at 0. The output has 2s in the surrounding cells, creating a plus shape. Then in the next rows, the 2s spread further, but maybe up to a certain distance. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell with a number greater than 1 (like 2,3,6,8 in the examples) causes all the 0s in the same \"region\" around them to be filled with that number, but only if they're enclosed by 1s. Wait, looking at Example 0's input, the 2 is in the middle of a structure made of 1s. The output replaces the 0s within that enclosed area with 2s. Similarly, in Example 1, the 3 is in an enclosed area made of 1s, and the 0s in that area are replaced with 3s.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that regions enclosed by 1s (forming a sort of closed loop) and containing a single non-zero, non-one number (like 2,3,6,8) have all their internal 0s replaced by that number. So, the 2 in the first example is inside a diamond-shaped region of 1s. The output fills all the 0s inside that diamond with 2s. Similarly, the 3 in the second example is in a similar enclosed region, and the 0s inside are filled with 3s. The same applies to 6 and 8 in Example 2.\n\nLooking at the inputs:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2 is at row 3, column 3. The surrounding structure is made of 1s forming a diamond. The output replaces all the 0s inside that diamond with 2s. Similarly, in the test input, there's a 4 in row 2, column 2 (if rows start at 0). So perhaps the region enclosed by 1s around that 4 should be filled with 4s.\n\nWait, but let's check the Test Input. The Test Input's second row is [1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]. Then the third row is [1,0,4,0,1,...]. The fourth row is [1,0,0,0,1,...], and the fifth row is [1,1,1,1,1,...]. So this forms a sort of diamond or square structure. The 4 is inside this structure. So according to the pattern, the 0s inside this structure should be replaced with 4s.\n\nSimilarly, in the lower part of the Test Input, there's a 7 at row 7, column 6. The surrounding structure is made of 1s. The 7 is in the middle of a structure similar to the ones in the examples. So the 0s inside that structure should be replaced with 7s.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each number greater than 1, check if it's in a closed region formed by 1s. Then, replace all 0s within that region with the number. Additionally, the output in the examples also shows that the number's position and surrounding 0s are replaced. So the process could be:\n\n1. Identify all regions enclosed by 1s.\n2. For each such region, if there's exactly one cell with a number (non-zero, non-one), replace all 0s in that region with that number.\n\nBut how to define a region enclosed by 1s? Maybe a flood fill approach: regions of 0s that are completely surrounded by 1s. Then, if such a region contains a single non-1, non-0 number, all the 0s in that region are replaced by that number.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input: the 2 is in an enclosed region. The output replaces all 0s in that region with 2. Similarly, in Example 1, the 3 is in an enclosed region, and all 0s there become 3s. In Example 2, the 6 and 8 are each in their own enclosed regions, and the 0s are replaced accordingly.\n\nSo, applying this to the Test Input:\n\nIn the upper part, the 4 is inside a region enclosed by 1s. Let's check the structure. The rows from 1 to 4 form a diamond:\n\nRow 1: [1,1,0,1,1,...]\nRow 2: [1,0,4,0,1,...]\nRow 3: [1,0,0,0,1,...]\nRow 4: [1,1,1,1,1,...]\n\nThis seems to form a 5x5 square? Or perhaps a diamond shape. The enclosed area would be the 0s within the 1s. The 4 is in this area, so all the 0s here should become 4s. Let's see what that would look like.\n\nSimilarly, in the lower part, the 7 is in a structure that's perhaps a diamond or cross. The rows 6 to 9:\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0]\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,1,0,7,0,1,0]\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0]\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nThis forms an enclosed area around the 7. The 0s in that area should become 7s.\n\nSo applying this, the output should replace the 0s in the upper enclosed area with 4s and the lower enclosed area with 7s.\n\nLooking back at the examples, when there are multiple such numbers (like in Example 2 with 6 and 8), each in their own regions, each region's 0s are replaced by their respective numbers.\n\nNow, let's try to reconstruct the Test Input's output.\n\nFirst, the upper region (rows 1-4, columns 0-4):\n\nOriginal input for row 1: [1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [1,0,4,0,1, ...]\nRow 3: [1,0,0,0,1, ...]\nRow 4: [1,1,1,1,1, ...]\n\nThe enclosed 0s here are the positions in row 1, columns 2; row 2, columns 1 and 3; row 3, columns 1,2,3.\n\nIn the output, these 0s should be replaced with 4. So:\n\nRow 1 becomes [1,1,4,1,1, ...] but wait, in the output examples, the first row after transformation in Example 0 was filled with 2s. Wait, in Example 0, the input's first row is all 0s. But the output's first row becomes [0,2,2,2,2,2,0,...]. Hmm, maybe the enclosed region is not just the immediate area around the number but a larger area. Wait, perhaps the enclosed region is a diamond shape. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is similar to a cellular automaton where the number (like 2,3,6,8) spreads to all adjacent 0 cells within the enclosed area. So, the number acts as a seed and fills the entire enclosed region.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 0s surrounded by 1s, with a 2 in the middle. The output replaces all 0s in that enclosed region with 2. So it's a flood fill starting from the 2, replacing all connected 0s in the enclosed area.\n\nSimilarly, in the Test Input, the 4 is in an enclosed area. All 0s connected to it (within the 1s) should become 4. Let's see:\n\nThe upper structure in Test Input:\n\nRow 1: [1,1,0,1,1, ...]\nRow 2: [1,0,4,0,1, ...]\nRow 3: [1,0,0,0,1, ...]\nRow 4: [1,1,1,1,1, ...]\n\nSo the 4 is at (2,2) (assuming rows start at 0). The connected 0s would include:\n\nIn row 1, column 2 (0) is between 1s. Then row 2, columns 1 and 3 (0s). Row 3, columns 1,2,3 (0s). So all these 0s are connected and enclosed by 1s. So they should all be replaced by 4.\n\nSimilarly, the 7 is in the lower structure. The structure is:\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0]\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,1,0,7,0,1,0]\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0]\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nThe 7 is at (7,6). The 0s around it are in row 7, columns 5 and 7; row 8, columns 5,6,7; and row 6, column 6. But wait, row 6, column 6 is 0, but it's adjacent to 1s. Wait, but is this enclosed?\n\nLooking at rows 6-9:\n\nRow 6: ...1,1,0,1,1,0\nRow 7: ...1,0,7,0,1,0\nRow 8: ...1,0,0,0,1,0\nRow 9: ...1,1,1,1,1,0\n\nSo the structure here is similar to the upper part. The 0s in rows 6-9 around the 7 are enclosed by 1s. So replacing those 0s with 7s.\n\nPutting this together, the output for the Test Input should have:\n\nIn the upper part (rows 1-4, columns 0-4):\n\nRow 1: [1,1,4,1,1, ...] but wait, in Example 0, the output's first row (row 0) is [0,2,2,2,2,2,0,...] which seems to be the top of the filled area. So maybe the filled area includes the cells around the central number. Let me check Example 0 again.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2 is in row 3 (third row from the top). The output for that area starts at row 0 with [0,2,2,2,2,2,...]. Wait, that's a bit confusing. How does the filled area spread upwards?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the filled region is the entire area enclosed by 1s. In Example 0's input, the 2 is in the middle of a diamond shape formed by 1s. The output shows that the entire enclosed area (which includes multiple rows above and below the 2) is filled with 2s. So the 2 is in the center, and the surrounding 0s in the diamond are filled.\n\nSo for the Test Input's upper structure:\n\nThe 4 is in row 2, column 2. The enclosed area is a diamond or square. The output would fill all 0s in that structure with 4s.\n\nLooking at the input rows 1 to 4:\n\nRow 1: [1,1,0,1,1, ...]\nRow 2: [1,0,4,0,1, ...]\nRow 3: [1,0,0,0,1, ...]\nRow 4: [1,1,1,1,1, ...]\n\nThe enclosed area here is a diamond with 0s. Let's imagine filling all 0s in that area with 4s. So:\n\nRow 1: the 0 at column 2 becomes 4. Also, the 0s in columns 1 and 3 may be filled? Wait, in Example 0, the output's first row (row 0) becomes a line of 2s. So maybe the filled area extends outward.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the structure is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s\n\nRow 1: 0,1,1,0,1,1,0...\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,0,0,1,0...\n\nRow 3: 0,1,0,2,0,1,0...\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,0,0,1,0...\n\nRow 5: 0,1,1,1,1,1,0...\n\nRows 6-9: all 0s.\n\nThe output has:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,2,2,2,2,0...]\n\nRow 1: [0,1,1,2,1,1,0...]\n\nRow 2: [0,1,2,2,2,1,0...]\n\nRow 3: [0,1,2,2,2,1,0...]\n\nRow 4: [0,1,2,2,2,1,0...]\n\nRow 5: [0,1,1,1,1,1,0...]\n\nSo the 2s form a diamond shape. The filled area starts at row 0 (which was all 0s) and expands. Wait, how does that happen? Because the original input's row 0 was all 0s. But in the output, row 0's columns 1-5 become 2s. That suggests that the filled area isn't just the immediate surroundings of the 2 but a larger area. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the filled area is determined by expanding the number in all directions until hitting 1s. But in Example 0, the 2 is surrounded by 1s in a diamond shape, but the output's filled area is larger. This is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that the number (like 2) in the input is the center of a plus-shaped cross that expands to replace 0s in the same row and column, but only up to the edges of the 1s. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2 is at row 3, column 3. The output's row 0 has 2s in columns 1-5. That's a horizontal line. Then row 1 has 2 in column 3, and the 1s are around. Wait, maybe it's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the number in the input (like 2) causes all 0s in the same connected region (enclosed by 1s) to be replaced by that number. So the entire enclosed area is filled with the number. But how is the enclosed region defined?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, the 2 is in a region that's enclosed by 1s. The output replaces all the 0s in that region with 2. The region includes multiple rows. For example, in the input, the 0s in rows 1-5, columns 1-5 form a diamond-shaped area enclosed by 1s. So the output replaces all those 0s with 2s.\n\nBut how does that work in Example 0's output? The first row of the input is all 0s, but the output's first row (row 0) has 2s in positions 1-5. But in the input, row 0 is all 0s. So that doesn't seem to fit. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the coordinates.\n\nWait, perhaps the rows are zero-indexed. Let's recheck Example 0:\n\nInput for Example 0:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,1,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRows 6-9: all 0s.\n\nThe output's row 0: [0,2,2,2,2,2,0,...]\n\nSo row 0, which was all 0s, now has 2s in columns 1-5. But how is that part of the enclosed area? The 1s in rows 1-5 form a diamond. So the enclosed area must include row 0? That's confusing because row 0 is outside the structure of 1s. Unless there's a different logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2 in row 3 is the center of a cross that expands vertically and horizontally until hitting 1s. So from the 2, you go left until 1, right until 1, up until 1, down until 1, and replace all 0s in those directions with 2. Then, maybe expand outward in layers.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nFrom the 2 at (3,3):\n\n- Moving up: row 3, column 3 is 2. Up to row 0, but in row 2, column 3 is 0, row 1, column 3 is 0 (since input row 1 is [0,1,1,0,1,1,...] so column 3 is 0). So replacing those 0s with 2s. Similarly for down, left, right.\n\nWait, but in the output, the 2s form a cross. For example, row 0's columns 1-5 are 2s. That suggests that the cross expands in all directions until hitting boundaries, but that doesn't align with the input structure.\n\nThis approach might not be correct. Let's try another angle.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the training examples:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 2s form a diamond shape. The first row of the output has 2s from column 1 to 5. Then each subsequent row adds more 2s, creating a diamond. So perhaps the pattern is to create a diamond shape around the seed number (2), expanding outward in a diamond pattern, replacing 0s with the seed number.\n\nBut how many layers? In Example 0's input, the seed is at row 3, column 3. The output's diamond extends up to row 0 (top) and down to row 5 (bottom). So the radius is 3 layers.\n\nAlternatively, the diamond's size depends on the position of the seed. In Example 0, the seed is in row 3. The diamond expands up 3 rows and down 2 rows (since the output has 2s in rows 0-5). Maybe the seed's position determines the expansion.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's think of the examples again.\n\nIn Example 1, the 3 is in the lower part. The output shows a diamond filled with 3s around it. Similarly, the 8 in Example 2's output forms a diamond.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that each seed number (like 2,3,6,8) creates a diamond-shaped area around it, replacing all 0s in that diamond with the seed's number. The diamond's size is such that it extends as far as possible until it hits 1s or the grid's edge.\n\nBut how to determine the diamond's size. For example, in the Test Input's upper part, the 4 is at row 2, column 2. So perhaps the diamond would extend from row 0 to row 4, columns 0-4. But the input's structure has 1s forming a diamond that encloses the 4. So the filled area would be within that structure.\n\nAlternatively, the diamond's size is determined by the distance from the seed to the enclosing 1s. For example, in Example 0, the seed is in row 3. The 1s are in rows 1-5. So the diamond expands to fill all 0s within the 1s.\n\nAnother approach: each seed number (non-zero, non-one) is the center of a cross that extends in all four directions (up, down, left, right) until a 1 is hit, and all 0s in those directions are replaced with the seed's number. Then, for each cell filled this way, repeat the cross expansion.\n\nWait, but Example 0's output has a diamond that is more than a cross. For example, row 0 in the output is [0,2,2,2,2,2,0...], which is a horizontal line. Then row 1 has 2s in the middle. So maybe it's a combination of horizontal and vertical expansions.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to perform a flood fill starting from the seed number, replacing all connected 0s in the same enclosed area. So, in Example 0, the 2 is in an enclosed area of 0s surrounded by 1s. Flood fill replaces all those 0s with 2.\n\nThis seems more plausible. Because in the input, the 2 is in the middle of a region of 0s that are completely enclosed by 1s. The output fills all 0s in that region with 2.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the 3 is in a separate enclosed area, and the 0s there are filled with 3.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For each cell in the input grid, if it's a number greater than 1, check if it's in an enclosed area of 0s surrounded by 1s.\n\n2. For each such area, replace all 0s with the seed number.\n\nBut how to determine the enclosed area. It's essentially a contiguous region of 0s that are enclosed by 1s, such that you can't reach the grid's edge without passing through 1s.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n- Find all enclosed regions (contiguous 0s surrounded by 1s).\n\n- For each enclosed region, if there's exactly one cell with a number greater than 1, replace all 0s in that region with that number.\n\n- If there are multiple numbers in the same region, perhaps it's invalid, but the examples don't have that case.\n\nIn the Test Input, the upper enclosed region has a 4 and the lower has a 7, each in their own regions. So replace upper 0s with 4 and lower with 7.\n\nLet's verify this with the examples.\n\nExample 0: The enclosed region is the area where the 2 is located. All 0s there become 2.\n\nExample 1: The upper enclosed region has a 2, and the lower has a 3. So 0s in upper become 2, lower become 3.\n\nExample 2: Upper region has 6, lower has 8. Replace 0s accordingly.\n\nSo applying this to the Test Input:\n\nUpper region (around 4) is enclosed by 1s. All 0s there become 4.\n\nLower region (around 7) is enclosed by 1s. All 0s there become 7.\n\nNow, let's construct the output.\n\nFirst, the upper part:\n\nOriginal rows 1-4:\n\nRow 1: [1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [1,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe enclosed 0s are:\n\nRow 1: columns 2 (0)\n\nRow 2: columns 1 (0),3 (0)\n\nRow 3: columns 1 (0),2 (0),3 (0)\n\nSo replacing these with 4:\n\nRow 1 becomes [1,1,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, the output examples like Example 0's first row after transformation was filled with 2s. Wait, in Example 0's output row 0 (which was all 0s in input) becomes [0,2,2,2,2,2,0,...]. How does that fit into this logic?\n\nAh, maybe I'm missing something. In Example 0's input, the enclosed region includes row 0's 0s. But how? Because row 0 is all 0s, which are not surrounded by 1s. Unless the enclosed region is different.\n\nWait, maybe the enclosed region is not just a simple area. Let me re-examine Example 0's input:\n\nThe input for Example 0 has 1s forming a diamond shape from rows 1-5, columns 1-5. So the enclosed 0s are inside this diamond. The 2 is in row 3, column 3. So the enclosed region is the 0s inside the diamond. The output fills all those 0s with 2. But in the output, row 0 has 2s. That's confusing because row 0 in the input was all 0s, which are outside the diamond.\n\nThis suggests that my previous logic is incorrect. There must be a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number in the input is the center of a diamond-shaped area where all 0s within that diamond are replaced by the number, regardless of surrounding 1s. The size of the diamond could be determined by the position of the number.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 is at row 3, column 3. The diamond in the output spans from row 0 to row 5, columns 1-5. So the diamond's height is 6 rows, width 5 columns. The center is at row 3.\n\nWait, the output's row 0 in Example 0 is [0,2,2,2,2,2,0,...]. Columns 1-5 are 2s. So maybe the diamond is a horizontal line at the top, and gets wider towards the center.\n\nAlternatively, the diamond is formed by expanding the number's value in all four diagonal directions. For example, starting from the center, each layer adds a ring of the number around it.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the 2s form layers:\n\nRow 0: columns 1-5 (5 cells)\n\nRow 1: columns 1-2 (1s), then column 3 (2), then columns 4-5 (1s). Wait no, the output row 1 is [0,1,1,2,1,1,0...]. So it's not a diamond shape. Hmm, this is getting really confusing.\n\nLet me try to think of another approach. Looking at the training examples, the output seems to have layers around the seed number. For example, in Example 0's output, the seed is at row 3, column 3. The layers are:\n\nRow 3: [0,1,2,2,2,1, ...]\n\nRow 2: [0,1,2,2,2,1, ...]\n\nRow 1: [0,1,1,2,1,1, ...]\n\nRow 0: [0,2,2,2,2,2, ...]\n\nSo the 2s form a kind of diamond expanding upward and downward. Maybe it's a matter of expanding the seed number in all directions, replacing 0s with the seed number until hitting 1s or the grid's edge.\n\nBut how exactly?\n\nAnother observation: the seed number is in the central position of a structure made of 1s. The output replaces 0s in the same structure with the seed number, but also expands outward beyond the original structure. For example, in Example 0's input, the structure around the 2 is a diamond of 1s with 0s inside. The output replaces those 0s with 2s and also extends outward beyond the original structure.\n\nWait, but the output's row 0 in Example 0 is outside the original structure. That's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, the output for Example 0 is creating a larger diamond shape around the seed, which may extend beyond the original 1s. But that doesn't make sense because the original 1s should form a boundary.\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe I should try to see what the Test Input's output should look like based on the examples.\n\nIn the Test Input's upper region:\n\nSeed number 4 is at row 2, column 2.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the output for a seed in row 3, column 3 has the first row (row 0) filled with 2s from column 1-5.\n\nIn the Test Input, the seed is in row 2. So perhaps the filled area extends upward and downward similarly. For example, the filled area would start at row 0 and go to row 4, creating a diamond.\n\nBut the input's upper structure in Test Input has 1s forming a diamond. The 4 is inside. So the output should fill the 0s inside that structure with 4.\n\nSo row 1 of the Test Input's input is [1,1,0,1,1, ...]. The 0 is at column 2. So in the output, this 0 becomes 4. Row 2: [1,0,4,0,1, ...] becomes [1,4,4,4,1, ...]. Row 3: [1,0,0,0,1, ...] becomes [1,4,4,4,1, ...]. Row 4 remains the same as it's all 1s.\n\nSo the upper part of the output would look like:\n\nRow 1: [1,1,4,1,1, ...]\n\nRow 2: [1,4,4,4,1, ...]\n\nRow 3: [1,4,4,4,1, ...]\n\nBut according to the examples, like Example 0, the first row of the output has a line of 2s, which suggests that the filled area extends beyond the original structure. But that might not be the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the filled area is determined by the Manhattan distance from the seed. For example, the seed's value is placed in all cells that are at a certain distance, but this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the transformation as filling all cells that are in the same row or column as the seed, but only those that are 0 and within the enclosed area.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Let's look at Example 0's input and output again.\n\nInput:\n\nRow 3: [0,1,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput rows 0-5:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,2,2,2,2,0...]\n\nRow 1: [0,1,1,2,1,1,0...]\n\nRow 2: [0,1,2,2,2,1,0...]\n\nRow 3: [0,1,2,2,2,1,0...]\n\nRow 4: [0,1,2,2,2,1,0...]\n\nRow 5: [0,1,1,1,1,1,0...]\n\nSo the 2s form a diamond shape where the top row (row 0) is a horizontal line of 2s, and each subsequent row has more 2s until the middle row, then fewer. But how does this relate to the input's structure?\n\nThe input's structure has 1s forming a diamond, and the output's 2s fill the area inside that diamond. The 2 in the input is at the center of that diamond. So the output fills all 0s inside the diamond with 2s. \n\nSo the pattern is: for any enclosed area of 0s surrounded by 1s, if there's a single number (non-1, non-0) in that area, all 0s in that area are replaced with that number.\n\nThus, the Test Input's upper area has 0s enclosed by 1s and a 4. So all those 0s become 4s. Similarly, the lower area has 7 and enclosed 0s, which become 7s.\n\nSo applying this:\n\nFor the upper part:\n\nRow 1: [1,1,0,1,1, ...] \u2192 [1,1,4,1,1, ...]\n\nRow 2: [1,0,4,0,1, ...] \u2192 [1,4,4,4,1, ...]\n\nRow 3: [1,0,0,0,1, ...] \u2192 [1,4,4,4,1, ...]\n\nRow 4 remains [1,1,1,1,1, ...]\n\nFor the lower part:\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,1,1,7,1,1,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,1,0,7,0,1,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,1,7,7,7,1,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,1,7,7,7,1,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0] \u2192 remains same except the 0s inside are filled. Wait, but row 9 has [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0], which is all 1s except the first four 0s. But those 0s are outside the enclosed area. The enclosed area is the part around the 7 in row 7, column 6.\n\nIn the lower structure:\n\nRows 6-9:\n\nRow 6: columns 4-8 are 1,1,0,1,1,0\n\nRow 7: columns 4-8 are 1,0,7,0,1,0\n\nRow 8: columns 4-8 are 1,0,0,0,1,0\n\nRow 9: columns 4-8 are 1,1,1,1,1,0\n\nThe enclosed area is the 0s in rows 6-9, columns 5-7. So in row 6, column 6 is 0; row 7, columns 5 and 7 are 0; row 8, columns 5-7 are 0. So these 0s are enclosed by 1s and the seed 7 is in row 7, column 6. Thus, all these 0s should become 7s.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 6: columns 6 \u2192 7. So row 6 becomes [0,0,0,0,1,1,7,1,1,0]\n\nRow 7: columns 5 and 7 \u2192 7. So row 7 becomes [0,0,0,0,1,7,7,7,1,0]\n\nRow 8: columns 5-7 \u2192 7. So row 8 becomes [0,0,0,0,1,7,7,7,1,0]\n\nRow 9: no changes as there are no 0s in the enclosed area.\n\nPutting this all together, the Test Input's output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[1, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[1, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nWait, but comparing to the training examples, like Example 1, the output includes some surrounding 0s outside the immediate enclosed area. For example, in Example 1's output, there's a row with 3s in the middle of the grid that's outside the original enclosed area. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the filled area is not just the immediate enclosed region but extends further. For example, in the upper part of the Test Input, after filling the enclosed 0s with 4s, perhaps the entire area around the seed is filled in a diamond shape.\n\nBut how to reconcile that with the examples.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the filled area extends from row 0 to row 5, columns 1-5. But the input's structure is such that the 1s form a diamond in rows 1-5. So row 0's 0s are outside the 1s' structure. But in the output, they are filled with 2s. That suggests that the pattern isn't just filling enclosed 0s but something else.\n\nThis is perplexing. Perhaps the pattern is that the seed number expands in all four directions (up, down, left, right) until hitting a 1, and fills all 0s in those directions with the seed number.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nSeed at row 3, column 3. Expanding up:\n\n- row 3 column 3 \u2192 row 2 column 3 (0) \u2192 becomes 2.\n\n- row 1 column 3 (0) \u2192 becomes 2.\n\n- row 0 column 3 (0) \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nBut the output's row 0 has columns 1-5 as 2s. So expanding in all directions from the seed until hitting 1s.\n\nBut the 1s in Example 0's input form a diamond. So expanding up from the seed (row 3, column 3) would stop when hitting 1s. Wait, row 1 in Example 0's input has 1s at columns 1,2,4,5. So expanding up from row 3, column 3 would go through row 2 (0), row 1 (0), but row 0 is all 0s. But why does the output's row 0 have 2s from columns 1-5?\n\nThis suggests that the expansion isn't just straight lines but something else. Perhaps the seed expands in a diamond shape, covering all cells at a Manhattan distance less than or equal to a certain value. For example, the seed's value is placed in all cells where the Manhattan distance from the seed is <= a certain radius.\n\nIn Example 0, the output's row 0 (distance 3 from seed row 3) has 2s in columns 1-5. The Manhattan distance from (3,3) to (0,1) is 3+2=5. This doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the seed's number is placed in all cells that are part of a cross that extends in all four directions until hitting a 1. Then, perhaps this is done in layers, creating a diamond shape.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Given the time I have, I think the correct approach is to assume that the seed number fills all 0s in the enclosed region (surrounded by 1s) that contains it. So the upper region in the Test Input's upper part has 0s enclosed by 1s, with a 4, so all those 0s become 4s. Similarly for the lower region with 7.\n\nThus, the Test Input's output would be:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [1,1,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [1,4,4,4,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [1,4,4,4,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,1,1,7,1,1,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,1,7,7,7,1,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,1,7,7,7,1,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nBut looking at Example 1's output, the filled regions for 3 include more than just the immediate 0s around the seed. For instance, in Example 1's input, the 3 is in row 8, column 6. The output's row 6 has [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0], which is a horizontal line of 3s. This suggests that the filled area extends to include more cells than just the immediate enclosure.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that the seed number fills all 0s in the same connected component, even if that component is not enclosed. But that doesn't fit with the first example. This is really confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the seed number fills all 0s that are reachable from the seed without passing through 1s, but the examples show that even in enclosed regions, the 0s are replaced.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the deadline, I'll proceed with the assumption that each seed number fills all 0s in its enclosed region (surrounded by 1s), replacing them with the seed's number.",
