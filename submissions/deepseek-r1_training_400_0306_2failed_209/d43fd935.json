        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, we have these input and output grids, and I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input into the output. Let's look at the examples to understand what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has numbers like 1, 6, 3, etc., and the output seems to add more numbers. Let's compare the input and output rows.\n\nIn the input's row 3 (index 3), there's [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. The output for this row becomes [0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]. So the 1s are spreading to the right from the existing 1. Wait, but the original 1 is at position 8 (0-based index 8). In the output, positions 4 to 8 in that row are 1. So maybe it's filling the cells between some points. But how?\n\nLooking at other examples might help. In Example 1, the input has 8s and 7s. The output has 8s spreading in some way. For instance, the third row in the output has 8s at positions 7,8,9. The original input had an 8 in position 9 of that row. So maybe numbers are expanding to the left? Or perhaps there's a connection between certain numbers and their positions relative to others.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's output, there's a vertical line of 6s added in the middle of some rows. The original input had 6s in positions like (1,8), (6,7), (7,6), (8,2). The output adds more 6s in a vertical line? Let's check:\n\nLooking at the output for Example 0:\n\nRow 5 (index 5): [0, 0, 6, 0, ...]\nRow 6: [0, 0, 6, 0, ...]\nRow 7: [0, 0, 6, 0, ...]\nRow 8: [0, 0, 6, 0, ...]\n\nSo there's a vertical line of 6s in column 2 (third column) from row 5 to 8. Where did that come from? The original 6s are at (1,8), (6,7), (7,6), (8,2). Wait, maybe each 6 is creating a vertical line upwards or downwards? But in this case, the vertical line is in a different column. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has 1s in certain positions, and the output adds more 1s vertically. For example, in the input, row 1 (index 1) has a 1 at column 4. The output in row 2, column 4 becomes 1, row 3 column 4 is 1, etc., creating a vertical line downward. Similarly, another 1 in row 8 (input) and output row 5 column 9 (original 1) has a vertical line upward? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 2's input, the 1s are at positions (1,4), (2,1), (5,9), (9,1). The output adds 1s in column 4 from row 1 down to row 5. So the 1 at (1,4) in the input (row 1) causes the cells below it (rows 2-5) in column 4 to become 1. Similarly, the 1 at (5,9) in input (row 5) is already at the bottom of the grid, so maybe that's why there's no extension there. The 1 at (9,1) in input (row 9) might not have anything below it. So perhaps each 1 creates a vertical line downward until another number is encountered.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the 1 in row 3, column 8 (original) is part of a horizontal line in the output. So maybe it's not vertical for 1s. That complicates things. Let me think again.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the row 3 has 1s from column 4 to 8. The original 1 is at column 8. So maybe the 1 is expanding to the left until it hits a non-zero cell. The cells between the starting 1 and another number (maybe the 3s) are filled with 1s. But the 3s are in columns 2 and 3. So in row 3, starting from column 8 (the 1), moving left, the cells are filled with 1 until they reach the 3s. So columns 4-8 become 1s. That makes sense. So the 1 is filling to the left until it hits the 3s.\n\nBut then, in Example 2's input, the 1 in row 1, column 4 (input) causes the cells below it in column 4 to become 1s. So vertical expansion. So maybe different numbers have different behaviors. For example, 1s expand vertically downward, 6s expand in some other direction, etc. But how to determine which numbers expand in which directions.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has 7s and 8s. The output shows some spread. For example, in row 2 of the output, there are 7 in column 4 and 8s in columns 7-9. The original input in row 2 had 7 in column 3 and 8 in column 9. The output adds 7 to column 4 (maybe expanding right) and 8s expanding left. So 7s might expand to the right, and 8s to the left? Let's check.\n\nOriginal 7 in row 2, column 3. Output row 2 has 7 in column 4. Wait, maybe it's expanding downward or in another direction. Alternatively, maybe when a number is present, it connects to other instances of the same number and fills the path between them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are acting like \"beacons\" and creating lines in certain directions. For example, 1s create vertical lines downward, 6s create diagonal lines, etc.\n\nLooking at Example 0's 6s: The input has 6s at (1,8), (6,7), (7,6), (8,2). The output adds 6s in column 2, rows 5-8. Wait, maybe each 6 is part of a diagonal line. Let's plot the positions:\n\nOriginal 6s:\n\n(1,8) row 1, column 8\n(6,7) row 6, column7\n(7,6) row7, column6\n(8,2) row8, column2\n\nIn the output, new 6s are added in column 2, rows5-8. For example, row5 column2 is 6, row6 column2 is 6, etc. So maybe the 6 at (8,2) is the end of a diagonal line. Wait, perhaps the 6s form a diagonal line from (8,2) upward and to the right? Let's see: (8,2) to (7,3) to (6,4), etc. But the output adds 6s in column2, which is a vertical line. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number N creates a line of Ns in a certain direction based on N. For example, 6s form a vertical line upward starting from their position. Let's check Example0's 6 in row1, column8. If it's a vertical line upward, but row1 is the top, so nothing. But in the output, there's a vertical line of 6s in column2, rows5-8. Maybe the 6 at (8,2) is creating a line upward. So from row8, column2, going up to row5, column2. That's 4 rows. So 6s are added in column2 from row5 to row8. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number N creates a line of Ns in the direction determined by N mod 4 or something. For example, 1 could be down, 6 could be left, etc. But how to determine that.\n\nLooking at Example1's 7s and 8s. In the output, row2 has a 7 in column4 and 8s in columns7-9. The original 8 in column9 might be spreading leftwards. So 8s expand to the left, filling the cells until another number. For row2, the original 8 is in column9, and the output fills columns7-9 with 8s. So maybe 8s expand leftwards. Similarly, the 7 in row2 column3 might expand rightwards. So 7s go right, 8s go left. Then 1s in Example0 expand left (since the 1 in row3 column8 expands left to column4). So the pattern might be that each number N expands in a certain direction (left, right, up, down) based on N's value. For example, N=1 expands left, N=6 expands down, etc. But how to determine the direction for each N.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction is determined by the number modulo 4. For instance:\n\n- 1 mod 4 =1 \u2192 direction left\n- 6 mod4=2 \u2192 direction down?\nWait, but in Example0, the 6s in the output form a vertical line downward. Let's see: the 6 at (8,2) in input, and output adds 6s above it in column2. So row5-8, column2. So the direction for 6 is upward? Or maybe the 6s are connected in a way that forms a vertical line. Alternatively, maybe each 6 creates a vertical line upwards. The 6 at row8 column2 would create a line upwards, filling rows5-8 (but why rows5? Maybe until another 6 is hit. Let's check the input for Example0's 6s. The input 6s are at (1,8), (6,7), (7,6), (8,2). The output adds 6s in column2 from rows5-8. So maybe the 6 at (8,2) is creating a line upwards until row5. Why row5? Maybe there's another 6 in row5 column2 in the output. Wait, in the output, row5 column2 is 6. But there's no 6 in row5 in the input. So perhaps each 6 in the input creates a vertical line upwards, starting from their position, for a certain number of steps. Alternatively, maybe it's a diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number N represents a direction and a distance. For example, N=1 could mean fill left until the next non-zero, N=6 could mean fill down until next non-zero, etc.\n\nWait, let's consider Example0 again. The 1 in row3 column8 (input) is surrounded by zeros except for the 3s in columns2 and3. In the output, the 1 expands left to column4, filling all cells in between with 1. So the 1 is expanding left until it hits the 3s. So the direction for 1 is left, and fills until it hits a non-zero cell.\n\nIn Example2, the 1 in row1 column4 (input) expands downward. So the 1 is in row1, column4. The output fills column4 in rows2-5 with 1s. So the direction for 1 is down. Wait, this contradicts the previous example. Hmm. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction depends on the number's value. For example:\n\n- 1: down\n- 3: maybe right\n- 6: up\n- 7: right\n- 8: left\n\nBut how to confirm this.\n\nLooking at Example1's 7s. The original 7 is in row2 column3. The output has 7 in row2 column4. So expanding to the right. Similarly, another 7 in row8 column1 (input) and output has 7s in row8, column1 (unchanged?) but also in row2 column4. Wait, maybe not. Let's look closer.\n\nIn Example1's input, row2 has 7 in column3 and 8 in column9. The output row2 has 7 in column4 and 8s in columns7-9. So 7 moves right, 8 moves left.\n\nAnother 7 in input row8 column1. The output row8 has 7 in column1. But looking at the output rows below:\n\nIn row4, column5 is 7. Not sure where that comes from. Maybe another 7 in row9, column6 (input). Hmm, maybe there's a connection between numbers and their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are creating bridges between each other. For example, if two instances of the same number are present, the cells between them in a straight line are filled. But that would require pairs. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0, the 1s: there's a 1 in row3 column8 and another in row9 column4 (output?), but in the input, there's a 1 in row3 column8 and another in row9 column4 in the input? Wait, input for Example0's row9 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], so 1 is in column4. The output row3 has 1s from column4 to8. So maybe the 1 in row9 column4 and the 1 in row3 column8 are connected, creating a line between them. But how? The positions are (3,8) and (9,4). The line between them would be diagonal. But in the output, row3 has 1s in columns4-8. So maybe not. Alternatively, maybe each 1 in the input creates a vertical line downward from their position until another 1 or a non-zero cell.\n\nIn Example2, the 1 in row1 column4 (input) creates a vertical line down to row5 column4. Then, the 1 in row5 column9 (input) doesn't have any cells below it, so nothing. The 1 in row2 column1 (input) creates a vertical line down, but in the output, row2 column1 is 1, and the output has row3-5 column4 as 1s. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up rows and columns.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to find a systematic approach.\n\nFor each number in the input grid, what changes in the output? Let's take each example and see:\n\nExample0:\n\nOriginal 1s:\n- (0,0): row0, column0\n- (3,8): row3, column8\n- (9,4): row9, column4 (input's last row is row9)\n\nIn output:\n\n- The 1s in (0,0) and (9,4) remain.\n- The 1 in (3,8) is now part of a horizontal line from column4 to8 in row3. Also, the 1 in (9,4) has a vertical line upward in column4 from row9 up to row5? No, the output in row5 has 1 in column9. Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, the output in Example0's row3: columns4-8 are 1s. The original 1 is at column8. So the 1 expands left to column4. Between columns4 and8, all are 1s. The 3s are at columns2-3. So the expansion stops at column4. So the rule could be: for each number, expand in a certain direction until a non-zero cell (other than itself) is encountered.\n\nIn Example0's 3s in row3 and4: they are 3,3. The output keeps them the same, but the 1s expand to the left into row3.\n\nSo maybe each number N expands in a direction specific to N, filling cells with N until another non-zero cell is hit.\n\nPossible directions:\n\n- 1: left\n- 6: up (since the 6 in row8 column2 in input leads to a vertical line upwards)\n- 3: no expansion (since they stay the same)\n- 7: right (as in Example1, the 7 in row2 column3 expands to column4)\n- 8: left (as in Example1's 8 in row2 column9 expands left to column7)\n\nIf this is the case, then for each number N in the input, we expand in a direction based on N:\n\n- 1 \u2192 left\n- 6 \u2192 up\n- 7 \u2192 right\n- 8 \u2192 left\n- 3 \u2192 no expansion\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nIn Example0's 6s:\n\nThe 6 at (1,8) (row1, column8) would expand up, but since row1 is the first row, nothing. The 6 at (6,7) (row6, column7) would expand up. How far? Up to where? Maybe until another non-zero cell.\n\nIn the output, row6 column7 becomes 6 (original), and rows5-8 column2 are filled with 6s. Wait, that doesn't fit. So perhaps this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 6 is creating a vertical line upwards. For example, the 6 at row8 column2 in input would fill upwards to row5 column2. How? The line is from (8,2) up to (5,2). So three cells up. But why three?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are forming a diagonal. For example, the 6 in row6, column7 (input) would move up and left to row5, column6? But in the output, there's a 6 in row5 column2. That doesn't fit. This is confusing.\n\nAnother approach: look for the new numbers added in the output and see which input cells could have caused them.\n\nIn Example0's output, the vertical line of 6s in column2, rows5-8. The input has a 6 in row8 column2. So maybe that 6 is expanding upwards. So from row8 to row5 in column2. Why up to row5? Maybe until another 6 is hit. But there's no 6 in row5 column2 in the input. Unless there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, the 6 at row8 column2 expands upward for a certain number of steps. Let's count: from row8 to row5 is 3 steps. But why 3?\n\nAlternatively, the 6 in row8 column2 (input) is part of a group of 6s that form a diagonal. For example, 6 at (1,8), (6,7), (7,6), (8,2). These positions form a pattern. But how to connect them. (1,8) to (6,7): each step down and left. Then (6,7) to (7,6): down and left. But (7,6) to (8,2) is down and left four steps. Not consistent. Maybe it's a spiral or something else. Alternatively, the 6s are forming a path that is being filled in the output. But I can't see it.\n\nLet's think of the 6s in Example0's output. The new 6s are in column2, rows5-8. So column2, rows5,6,7,8. Input has a 6 in row8, column2. So perhaps this 6 is expanding upward for three rows. But why three? Maybe the number of expansions is equal to the number's value modulo something. 6 mod4 is 2. So maybe two steps? But it's three rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each 6 in the input creates a vertical line upwards for as long as possible, filling with 6s until a non-zero cell is found. The 6 at (8,2) in input would expand upward. The cells above it in column2 are zeros until row5. In the output, rows5-8 have 6 in column2. But why row5? Let's check the input. The cells above (8,2) in column2:\n\nRow7, column2: 0\nRow6, column2:0\nRow5, column2:0\nRow4, column2:0\nRow3, column2:3\nSo the expansion would stop at row3, which has a 3. But in the output, the 6s go up to row5. So perhaps this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are part of a different pattern. Like, connecting to other 6s. The input has 6s at (1,8), (6,7), (7,6), (8,2). The output adds a vertical line in column2. How are these connected? Maybe the 6s form a kind of chain. For example, each 6 points to the next 6 in a certain direction, and the line is drawn between them. But I can't see the connection between (8,2) and (7,6). The distance is 4 columns left and 1 row up.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's try another angle.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe test input has numbers 2,6,3, etc. So perhaps applying the same rules. For example, 2 might expand in a certain direction, 6s expand upward, etc.\n\nBut how to determine the direction for each number. Let's look for a pattern in the training examples.\n\nFor Example0:\n\n- 1 expands left (from column8 to4)\n- 6s: added vertical line in column2 rows5-8\n\nFor Example1:\n\n- 7 expands right (from column3 to4)\n- 8 expands left (from column9 to7)\n\nExample2:\n\n- 1 expands downward (from row1 column4 to rows2-5 column4)\n\nSo perhaps the rule is:\n\nEach number N expands in a direction determined by N mod 4:\n\n- N mod4 =0: up\n- N mod4 =1: right\n- N mod4 =2: down\n- N mod4 =3: left\n\nWait, but for example:\n\nIn Example0, 1 mod4 is 1. So direction right. But the 1 in row3 column8 expands left, which is direction 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by N mod4 as follows:\n\n0: up\n1: right\n2: down\n3: left\n\nBut in Example0's 1 (N=1 mod4=1 \u2192 right), but the expansion was to the left. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction is determined by the number's last digit. For example:\n\nNumbers ending with 1: left\nNumbers ending with 6: up\nBut 6 mod10 is6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is based on the number's value:\n\n1: left\n6: up\n3: right\n7: right\n8: left\n\nBut this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the expansion direction is based on the number's value as follows:\n\n- 1: left\n- 2: down\n- 3: right\n- 6: up\n- 7: right\n- 8: left\n\nBut how to confirm this.\n\nIn Example0's 6s: the expansion is upward (assuming the 6 at row8 column2 expands up to row5). So direction up.\n\nIn Example1's 7s (which are 7) expand to the right.\n\nExample1's 8s expand to the left.\n\nExample2's 1s expand down.\n\nSo possible mapping:\n\n1 \u2192 down\n6 \u2192 up\n7 \u2192 right\n8 \u2192 left\n3 \u2192 no expansion (since they stay the same)\n2 \u2192 ?\n\nBut for the test input, there are 2s. So what direction would 2 expand? If 2's direction is down, then in the test input, the 2s would expand downward.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input has 2s at:\n\nRow0, column3: [0,0,0,2,...]\nRow1, column0: [2,...]\nRow2, column7: [0,...,2,...]\nRow8, column7: [...,2]\n\nSo four 2s. If 2's direction is down, then each 2 would expand downward.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFor the 2 in row0 column3. Expanding down. The cells below it are row1-9 column3. The output should fill these with 2 until a non-zero cell is hit.\n\nLooking at the input's column3:\n\nRow0:2\nRow1:0\nRow2:0\nRow3:0\nRow4:0\nRow5:0\nRow6:3\nRow7:3\nRow8:0\nRow9:6 (test input row9 has [0,0,0,6,0,6,...])\n\nSo the 2 in row0 column3 would expand down until row6 column3, which is 3. So fill rows0-5 column3 with 2.\n\nBut the output for this would be:\n\nRow0: 2\nRow1: 2\nRow2:2\nRow3:2\nRow4:2\nRow5:2\nRow6:3 (unchanged)\n...\n\nSimilarly, the 2 in row1 column0 (input row1, column0) would expand down. The cells below are rows2-9 column0. Looking at the input:\n\nRow2 column0:0\nRow3 column0:6 (test input row3 is [6, ...])\nSo expanding down from row1 column0, it would fill rows1-2 column0 with 2 until it hits the 6 in row3 column0. So rows1 and2 column0 become 2.\n\nThe 2 in row2 column7 would expand down. Cells below: rows3-9 column7. Let's check:\n\nRow3 column7:0\nRow4 column7:0\nRow5 column7:0\nRow6 column7:0\nRow7 column7:0\nRow8 column7:2 (input row8 has a 2 in column7)\nRow9 column7:0\n\nSo expanding down from row2 column7 would fill rows3-7 column7 with 2. Then, row8 column7 is already 2, so maybe it continues? Or stops. If the direction is down, then row2's 2 expands down until another non-zero cell. But row8 column7 is 2, same number. Do we stop or continue?\n\nHmm, in Example0's 1s, the 1 expanded left until it hit 3s. So maybe same number doesn't stop expansion. Let me check Example0's 1. In the input, row3 column8 is 1, and expands left until the 3s. The 3s are not 1, so they block. So perhaps, expansion stops at cells with different numbers, but same numbers don't block.\n\nSo for the 2 in row2 column7 expanding down:\n\nFill rows3-8 column7 with 2s. Because the next non-2 is row9 column7, which is 0. So all cells down to row8 are filled. But row8 column7 is already a 2 in the input, so maybe that's allowed.\n\nSimilarly, the 2 in row8 column7 (input) would expand down. But row9 column7 is 0, so only row8 and9 column7. Wait, row9 column7 is 0, so the 2 expands down into row9 column7.\n\nSo in the output, these 2s would form vertical lines.\n\nNow, the 6s in the test input. Let's see. For example, row3 column0 is 6. If 6's direction is up, then expand upward.\n\nRow3 column0 is 6. Expanding up would fill rows0-2 column0 with 6. But row0 column0 is 0, row1 column0 is 2 (input), row2 column0 is 0. So the expansion would stop at row1 column0 (since it's non-zero). So rows2 and3 column0 become 6? Or only up until the first non-zero.\n\nWait, the expansion rule might be to fill all cells in the direction until a non-zero cell (including other numbers) is encountered. So for row3 column0 (6), expanding up would fill rows0-2 column0 with 6 until row1 column0 (which is 2). So the expansion stops at row1 column0, so row2 and3 column0 are filled with 6. But row1 has 2, so it's blocked. So the 6 from row3 column0 would expand up to row2 column0, filling row2 and row3 (but row3 is already 6). So output rows0-2 column0 would be:\n\nRow0:6 (if allowed), but input row0 column0 is 0. Wait, the expansion direction for 6 is up, so from row3 column0, moving upward, filling rows2,1,0. But row1 column0 is 2. So the expansion stops at row2 column0. So row3's 6 expands up to row2 column0, filling that cell. So row2 column0 becomes 6, but row1 is blocked.\n\nSimilarly, the 6 in row6 column0 (test input row6 is [6, 0, 3, ...]) would expand upward. From row6 column0 to rows5,4,3, etc. The input's column0:\n\nRow0:0\nRow1:2\nRow2:0 (now filled with 6 from previous expansion)\nRow3:6\nRow4:0\nRow5:0\nRow6:6\n\nSo the 6 in row6 column0 would expand upward to row5 column0 (since row3 column0 is 6, but there's row4 and5 in between. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number expands in their direction until they hit any non-zero cell (regardless of value), and fill the cells in between with their own number.\n\nSo for example, the 6 in row3 column0 (test input) expands upward. The cells above are row2 column0 (0), row1 column0 (2), row0 column0 (0). The expansion stops at row1 column0 because it's non-zero. So row3's 6 would fill row2 column0 with 6. Row1 column0 is 2, so expansion stops. So row2 column0 becomes 6.\n\nThe 6 in row6 column0 would expand upward. The cells above are row5 column0 (0), row4 column0 (0), row3 column0 (6). So the expansion from row6's 6 would fill rows5 and4 column0 with 6, but stops at row3 column0 (same number?), or does the same number block? If same number doesn't block, then the expansion would continue. But how. In Example0, the 3s didn't block each other; they remained. So perhaps same numbers don't block. So the 6 in row6 column0 expands upward, filling rows5,4,3,2,1,0 column0 until a non-6 is hit. But row3 column0 is 6 (from previous expansion), so it continues past that. But row1 column0 is 2. So the expansion from row6's 6 would fill rows5,4,3,2 column0 with 6, stopping at row1 column0 (which is 2). So row5,4,3,2 column0 become 6.\n\nBut this is getting quite involved. Let's try to apply this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\nRow3: [6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0]\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow6: [6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow7: [0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\nRow9: [0,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0]\n\nLet's process each number:\n\nFor 2s:\n\nDirection for 2 is down (assuming 2's direction is down).\n\nRow0 column3 (2): expand down until non-zero. Cells below:\n\nRow1 column3:0 \u2192 2\n\nRow2 column3:0 \u21922\n\nRow3 column3:0 \u21922\n\nRow4 column3:0 \u21922\n\nRow5 column3:0 \u21922\n\nRow6 column3:3 (3 is non-2) \u2192 stop. So rows0-5 column3 become 2.\n\nRow0 column3: remains 2.\n\nRow1 column3: becomes 2.\n\nRow2 column3: 2.\n\nRow3 column3: 2.\n\nRow4 column3:2.\n\nRow5 column3:2.\n\nRow6 column3:3 (unchanged).\n\nRow1 column0 (2): expand down.\n\nRow2 column0:0 \u21922\n\nRow3 column0:6 \u2192 non-2 \u2192 stop. So rows1-2 column0 become 2.\n\nRow2 column0:2.\n\nRow3 column0:6 (unchanged).\n\nRow2 column7 (2): expand down.\n\nRow3 column7:0 \u21922\n\nRow4 column7:6 \u2192 non-2 \u2192 stop. So row3 column7 becomes 2.\n\nRow4 column7:6 (unchanged).\n\nRow8 column7 (2): expand down.\n\nRow9 column7:0 \u21922. So row9 column7 becomes 2.\n\nFor 6s:\n\nDirection is up.\n\nRow3 column0 (6): expand up.\n\nRow2 column0:0 \u21926 (but row2 column0 was filled with 2 from the 2 expansion. So conflicting?)\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because the 2 in row1 column0 expands down to row2 column0 as 2, but the 6 in row3 column0 expands up to row2 column0 as 6. Which one takes precedence?\n\nThis is where the order of operations matters. Maybe numbers are processed in a certain order, like from top to bottom, left to right. Or perhaps the expansions are done in a way that later numbers overwrite previous ones. Or perhaps all expansions are applied simultaneously based on the original input.\n\nAssuming that the expansions are based on the original input and not modified during processing (so all expansions are computed from the initial state, not the evolving grid), then each number's expansion is based on the input grid.\n\nSo, for example, the 2 in row1 column0 expands down, and the 6 in row3 column0 expands up. Both changes are applied to the original grid.\n\nSo for row2 column0:\n\nOriginal is 0. Both expansions (from 2 down and 6 up) would fill it. Which one wins? Or maybe there's a priority based on the number value. Higher numbers override lower ones. For example, 6 is higher than 2, so 6 would take precedence. Or vice versa.\n\nLooking at the training examples, in Example0's output, the 1s and 3s coexist. The 3s are in columns2-3, and 1s start from column4. So they don't interfere. In Example1's output, the 7s and 8s are in different columns, so no overlap. But if there's a conflict, how is it resolved?\n\nIn the test input, row2 column0 is 0. The 2's expansion would set it to 2, and the 6's expansion would set it to 6. Which one is applied?\n\nPossibly, the highest number takes priority. Or maybe the latest expansion. But the training examples don't provide such conflicts, so it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all expansions are additive, but if two numbers try to fill the same cell, the higher number takes precedence. For example, if a cell is to be filled with 2 and 6, the higher number (6) wins.\n\nSo in row2 column0, the 2's expansion (from row1 column0) would fill it with 2, and the 6's expansion (from row3 column0) would fill it with 6. Since 6 >2, the cell becomes 6.\n\nBut how to confirm this from training examples.\n\nLooking at Example0's output: in row3, column4-8 are filled with 1s, but the original 3s are in columns2-3. So 1s are lower than 3s, but they don't conflict.\n\nIn Example1's output row2: column4 has 7 and columns7-9 have 8. No conflict.\n\nSo, perhaps when two numbers expand into the same cell, the higher number takes precedence.\n\nAssuming that, in the test input's row2 column0, 6 would override 2.\n\nSo proceeding:\n\nProcessing 2s:\n\n- 2 in row0 column3 expands down to rows1-5 column3 as 2.\n\n- 2 in row1 column0 expands down to row2 column0 as 2.\n\n- 2 in row2 column7 expands down to row3 column7 as 2.\n\n- 2 in row8 column7 expands down to row9 column7 as 2.\n\nProcessing 6s:\n\n- 6 in row3 column0 expands up to row2 column0 (now 6), row1 column0 is 2 (blocked).\n\n- 6 in row4 column7 expands up. So from row4 column7, expand up.\n\nOriginal cells above row4 column7:\n\nrow3 column7:0 (but after processing 2s, it's 2). Wait, but if expansions are based on the original grid, then row3 column7 is 0. So 6 in row4 column7 expands up:\n\n row3 column7:0 \u21926\n\n row2 column7:2 (original is 2, but in the original grid, row2 column7 is 2. So if expanding up, 6 would replace it.\n\nWait, but in the original grid, row4 column7 is 6, and expanding up would fill rows3,2,1,0 column7.\n\nRow3 column7:0 \u21926\n\nRow2 column7:2 (original) \u21926 (since 6 >2)\n\nRow1 column7:0 \u21926\n\nRow0 column7:0 \u21926\n\nSo rows0-3 column7 would be filled with 6, overwriting the 2 in row2 column7.\n\nBut the 2 in row2 column7 was part of the input and expanded down. So if expansions are based on original grid, then both expansions are applied, but in case of conflict, higher number wins.\n\nSo row2 column7 would be 6.\n\nSimilarly, 6 in row6 column0 (test input row6 column0) expands up. Original cells above:\n\nrow5 column0:0 \u21926\n\nrow4 column0:0 \u21926\n\nrow3 column0:6 \u2192 same, but since it's already 6, maybe stops. Or continues past.\n\nAssuming expansion stops at any non-zero cell (regardless of value), then the 6 in row6 column0 expands up until row3 column0 (which is 6 in original). So rows6 column0 expands to rows5 and4 column0 (0s in original). So row5 and4 column0 become 6.\n\n row6 column0 expands up: rows5,4 column0.\n\n row3 column0 is 6 (original), so expansion stops at row4 column0. So rows5 and4 column0 become 6.\n\nBut row4 column0 in original is 0.\n\nSo rows5 and4 column0 are filled with 6.\n\nAnother 6 in row9 column3 (test input row9 column3 is 6). Direction up. So expand up from row9 column3:\n\nrows8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0 column3.\n\nBut the original row0 column3 is 2 (input), so expansion stops there. So rows9-0 column3 are filled with 6 up to row0, but row0 column3 is 2. So from row9 up to row1 column3: filled with 6.\n\nBut wait, the original row0 column3 is 2. So expanding from row9 column3's 6 upward would fill rows8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 column3 with 6. But row0 column3 is 2, which is non-zero, so expansion stops at row1 column3.\n\nBut this would overwrite the 2s that were expanded from row0 column3's 2. So for example, row1 column3 was filled with 2 by the 2's expansion, but now the 6's expansion from row9 column3 would set it to 6.\n\nThis is getting very complex. Let's try to proceed step by step.\n\nFor the test input, the output should be generated by expanding each number in their respective directions, with higher numbers overriding lower ones where conflicts occur.\n\nAssuming directions are:\n\n1: down\n\n2: down\n\n3: right\n\n6: up\n\n7: right\n\n8: left\n\nBut how were these determined? Let's recap:\n\nIn Example0, 1 expands left, but according to Example2, 1 expands down. So this is a contradiction. So my earlier hypothesis is incorrect. This means I need to find another pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: look for the position of the number in the grid and how the output changes.\n\nAnother idea: the numbers represent the number of steps to expand in a certain direction. For example, a 2 would expand 2 steps in a direction. But how to determine the direction.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers form a path that is filled between pairs of the same number. For example, in Example0's output, the vertical 6s in column2 could be connecting the 6s in the input. But the input 6s are in (1,8), (6,7), (7,6), (8,2). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are connected via their positions, forming shapes like squares, lines, etc. For example, the 3s in Example0's input are in a 2x2 block. In the output, they remain the same. So perhaps 3s are blocks that don't expand.\n\nThe 1s in Example0's input are in positions that allow expansion to the left (row3 column8 to column4). The 1 in row9 column4 (input) expands upward (column4) to row5.\n\nSo for 1s, maybe they expand upward from their position. In row3 column8, the 1 expands upward, but in row3, it's already there. Or perhaps expand in all directions for a certain number of steps.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps I should look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output adds new numbers along rows or columns, connecting to existing numbers of the same value. For example, Example0's 6s form a vertical line in column2. The input's 6s include one at row8 column2. So the vertical line starts there. The other 6s might not be directly connected. So perhaps each number creates a line in a certain direction based on some rule, and these lines are added to the output.\n\nFor the test input's 2s, assuming they expand downward, the 2 in row0 column3 would fill down to row5 column3 (since row6 column3 is 3), and the 2 in row2 column7 would fill down to row7 column7 (since row8 column7 is 2, same number). The 2 in row8 column7 would fill down to row9 column7.\n\nThe 6s expand upward. The 6 in row3 column0 fills up to row2 column0 (since row1 column0 is 2), so row2 column0 becomes 6. The 6 in row4 column7 expands up to row3 column7 (0 in input), row2 column7 (2 in input), so row3 column7 becomes 6, but row2 column7 is 2, which is lower than 6, so 6 replaces it. The 6 in row6 column0 expands up to row5 column0 (0), row4 column0 (0), row3 column0 (6), so rows5 and4 column0 become 6. The 6 in row9 column3 expands up to row8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 column3 (all 0s except row0 column3 is 2). So rows9 to row1 column3 become 6, but row0 column3 is 2, so it stops at row1 column3. So rows1-9 column3 become 6.\n\nBut this would overwrite the 2s expanded from row0 column3. For example, row1 column3 was set to 2 by the 2's expansion, but the 6's expansion would set it to 6.\n\nThe 3s in the test input are in rows6 and7, columns2-3. They form a 2x2 block. In the training examples, 3s don't expand. So they remain as is.\n\nThe 6 in row9 column5 (test input row9, column5 is 6) expands up. So rows8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0 column5. Original row9 column5 is 6. Expanding up, rows8-0 column5. Original cells are 0 except perhaps row9 column5. So all those cells become 6.\n\nBut I'm not sure. This is very complex.\n\nPutting it all together, the output would have:\n\nFor 2s:\n\n- Row0 column3:2\n- Row1 column3:6 (overwritten by 6's expansion)\n- Row2 column3:6\n- Row3 column3:6\n- Row4 column3:6\n- Row5 column3:6\n- Row1 column0:2\n- Row2 column0:6 (overwritten by 6's expansion)\n- Row3 column0:6\n- Row2 column7:6 (overwritten by 6's expansion)\n- Row3 column7:6\n- Row8 column7:2\n- Row9 column7:2\n\nFor 6s:\n\n- Row3 column0:6\n- Row2 column0:6\n- Row4 column7:6\n- Row3 column7:6\n- Row2 column7:6\n- Row1 column7:6\n- Row0 column7:6\n- Row5 column0:6\n- Row4 column0:6\n- Row6 column0:6 (original)\n- Row5 column0:6\n- Row4 column0:6\n- Row3 column0:6\n- Row9 column3:6\n- Row8 column3:6\n- Row7 column3:6\n- Row6 column3:3 (unchanged)\n- Row5 column3:6\n- Row4 column3:6\n- Row3 column3:6\n- Row2 column3:6\n- Row1 column3:6\n- Row0 column3:2 (unchanged)\n\nFor 3s:\n\n- Rows6 and7 columns2-3 remain 3.\n\nFor the 6 in row9 column5:\n\n- Expand up: rows8-0 column5 become 6.\n\nPutting this into the grid:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,2,0,6,0,6,0,0]\nRow1: [2,0,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,0]\nRow2: [6,0,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,0]\nRow3: [6,0,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,0]\nRow4: [6,0,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,0]\nRow5: [6,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0]\nRow6: [6,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,0,0]\nRow7: [0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,0,0]\nRow8: [0,0,0,6,0,6,0,2,0,0]\nRow9: [0,0,0,6,0,6,0,2,0,0]\n\nBut this is a rough guess. The final answer would need to match the structure of the training examples. The training outputs usually have the original numbers plus new ones in lines or blocks. For example, in Example0, the 6s in column2 are added.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the final output would have vertical and horizontal lines of 6s and 2s where applicable.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples and then apply that pattern to the test input. Let me start by looking closely at the examples to spot any patterns.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has numbers like 1, 6, 3,3, etc. The output seems to add more numbers. For instance, in the third row of the input, there's a [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], which in the output becomes [0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]. So the 1s are spreading to the right from the existing 1? Wait, but there's a 1 in the last position of that row. Maybe it's filling in between certain numbers. Also, looking at the 6s. In the input, the 6s are in positions like (0,8), (6,7), (7,6), (8,2). In the output, there are more 6s added below. For example, row 5 in output has a 6 in column 2. Maybe the 6s are falling down or being duplicated downward?\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has 7s and 8s. The output has some spreading. Like in row 2 of the input, there's a 7 at column 3 and an 8 at column 9. The output in row 2 has 7,7,3,3,8,8,8. So maybe numbers spread to adjacent cells in some direction. Also, in Example 1's output, there are a lot of 7s added in the lower rows. For instance, row 5 has a 7 in column 5, and rows 4-9 have 7s in column 5. That looks like a vertical line of 7s. Maybe numbers are creating lines either horizontally or vertically from their positions?\n\nExample 2's input has 1s in certain positions. The output adds 1s in a vertical line. For example, the input has a 1 at (1,4) and (2,1). The output adds 1s going down from (1,4) to row 5. So maybe when there's a 1, it creates a vertical line downward? But wait, in the output, row 2 has 1 in column 4 as well. Hmm. Wait, the output shows that the 1 in (1,4) is present, and then in rows 2,3,4,5, column 4 there are 1s. So maybe when there's a 1, it fills all the cells below it in the same column until another number blocks it? But in the input, there's a 3,3 and 3,3 in rows 6 and 7. The output doesn't change those. So maybe the rule is that certain numbers (like 1) create vertical lines downward, while others (like 3) might do something else. But in Example 0, the 3,3 blocks are unchanged except for the 1s added next to them.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the third row has [0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,1,0], and the output in the same row becomes [0,0,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,0]. So the 1 from the end is spreading leftwards, filling the cells to the left until it hits the 3s? So the 1 is creating a horizontal line to the left. But in the output, the 1s start after the 3s. Wait, the original 1 is at position (row 3, column 8). The output shows that from column 4 to 8 (positions 4-8) in row 3, there are 1s. So that's to the left of the original 1. So maybe the 1 is expanding to the left until it hits a non-zero cell, which in this case would be the 3,3 in columns 2 and 3. So the 1 fills all cells to the left until blocked by another number. Similarly, in Example 2, the 1 at (1,4) in the input leads to 1s in column 4 in rows 2,3,4,5. So maybe vertical expansion.\n\nLooking at the 6s in Example 0. The input has 6s at (1,8), (6,7), (7,6), (8,2). The output adds 6s below some of them. For instance, row 5 has a 6 in column 2. Looking at the input's (8,2) is a 6. In the output, rows 5,6,7,8 in column 2 have 6s. So maybe 6s are duplicated downward from their original position. Like, each 6 creates a vertical line downward. Wait, the input's 6 at (1,8) is in the output still at (1,8), but in the output, there's a 6 in row 5, column 2. So perhaps 6s are moving down in some way, but not sure. Wait, looking at the input of Example 0's 6 positions:\n\nOriginal 6 positions:\n\nRow 1, column 8 (0-based? Assuming rows start at 0 or 1? The examples might be using 0-based or 1-based indices. Let's check. For example, in Example 0's input, the first row is [1,0,...], which in the output remains the same. The third row (index 3 if 0-based) in input has 3,3, and in output it has 3,3 followed by 1s. So perhaps the numbers expand in certain directions. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: For each number in the input, what changes in the output?\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nIn row 3 (if 0-based), column 8 has 1. Output has from column 4 to 8 in row 3 as 1s. So the 1 spreads left until it hits the 3s. So direction is left. The 3s themselves are unchanged.\n\nIn the same example, the 6s in rows 6,7,8 (input) are at positions (6,7), (7,6), (8,2). In the output, there are more 6s added below them? Wait, let's see:\n\nIn the output:\n\nRow 5 (input row 5 was all zeros) now has [0,0,6,0, ...]. So perhaps each 6 in the input creates a vertical line downward starting from their position. For example, the 6 at (8,2) (row 8, column 2) in the input would create 6s in rows 5,6,7,8 in column 2? Wait, no. Output rows 5,6,7,8 in column 2 have 6s. Wait:\n\nInput 6s:\n\nRow 1, column 8: in output, same spot.\n\nRow 6, column 7: output has 6 in same spot, and row 6, column 2 also a 6?\n\nWait, maybe the 6s are falling down? Like, each 6 moves down as far as possible, stacking on top of existing 6s. Or perhaps each 6 creates a vertical line downwards, but only if the cells are empty. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nThe 6 at row 1, column 8 (assuming rows start at 0) is at (1,8). In output, it's still there. Then there's a 6 at row 6, column 7 (6,7). Output has (6,7) as 6, and (6,2) as 0. Wait, but in the output, row 5, column 2 is 6. Hmm, perhaps the 6s are moving down but in some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe numbers with higher values (like 6) are \"heavier\" and fall down through the grid, stacking on top of lower numbers. Wait, that might not explain the 1s and 3s. Alternatively, each number type has a different behavior. For example, 1s spread left, 3s stay as blocks, 6s fall down to the bottom of the grid, and 7s or 8s do something else.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 7s and 8s. The output shows some spreading. For instance, the 7 in row 0, column 1 stays, but in row 2, column 4 becomes 7. Also, in row 8, column 1 is 7. The output adds 7s in column 5 of several rows. Maybe 7s spread to the right and down? Or create a diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number spreads in a specific direction. For example:\n\n- 1 spreads left\n- 6 spreads down\n- 3 remains as a block\n- 7 spreads diagonally?\n- 8 spreads right?\n\nBut I need to check more examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input 1s are at (1,4) and (2,1), (9,1). The output creates a vertical line of 1s from (1,4) down to row 5. So maybe 1s spread downward in their column. Wait, in the input, the 1 at (1,4) (row 1, column 4) in the output is now followed by 1s in rows 2,3,4,5 in column 4. So that's a vertical line downward from the original 1. But why does it stop at row 5? Because row 5, column 4 is 0 in the input, but the output's row 5 has a 1 in column 4. Then row 5, column 9 has a 1 in the input. So maybe each 1 creates a vertical line downward until the bottom of the grid, but in the output of Example 2, the line stops at row 5. Wait, the original 1 is at (1,4) (row index 1 if 0-based). The output adds 1s in rows 2,3,4,5 (indices 2,3,4,5) in column 4. That's four rows below. Maybe the 1 spreads down four cells? But why four? Or until it hits another number? Let's check the input. The original 1 is at (1,4). The cells below in column 4 are all zeros until row 6, which has a 3 in column 4. Wait, in the input, row 6 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0]. No, wait, in Example 2's input, the rows with 3,3 are at rows 6 and 7, columns 4 and 5. So row 6 is [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0]. So column 4 in row 6 is 3. So the 1 at (1,4) spreads down to row 5 (indices 1 to 5) but stops at row 6 because there's a 3. So the vertical spread of 1s stops when they hit a non-zero cell. So the rule could be: for each 1 in the input, fill all cells below it in the same column with 1 until a non-zero cell is encountered.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 0's input, the 1 at (3,8) (row 3, column 8) in the input spreads left to fill cells 4-8 in row 3. So maybe 1s spread left in their row until they hit a non-zero cell. Because in the same row, there are 3s at columns 2 and 3. So the 1 starts at column 8 and spreads left to column 4 (since columns 2 and 3 are blocked by 3s). So in the output, columns 4-8 in row 3 are 1s.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- For each cell in the input grid:\n\n   - If the cell is 1, spread left in the same row until a non-zero cell is found (not including that cell).\n\n   - If the cell is 6, spread downward in the same column until a non-zero cell is found.\n\n   - For 3s, they form blocks and are unchanged.\n\n   - For numbers like 7 and 8, perhaps they spread in a different direction. In Example 1, the 8 in row 0, column 6 (input) leads to 8s spreading right in the same row. In output, row 0 has 8 at column 6, and row 2 has 8s in columns 7-9. Wait, in the input of Example 1, there's an 8 at row 2, column 9. In the output, row 2 has 8s in columns 7,8,9. So maybe 8s spread to the right. Or perhaps 8s spread to the right and up/down?\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 1's 8s:\n\nInput has 8 at (0,6), (2,9), (5,1), (6,8), (7,3), (9,6), (9,9).\n\nIn the output:\n\nRow 0, column 6: 8 remains.\n\nRow 2, columns 7-9: 8s added. The original 8 is at column 9. So maybe 8s spread left. But why columns 7 and 8? If it's spreading left, then the 8 at column 9 would spread to columns 7,8. But why? Wait, the input row 2 has a 7 at column 3, 3s at columns 5 and 6. The output row 2 has 7 in column 3, then 7 in column4, then 3s in 5 and6, then 8s in7-9. So perhaps the 8s spread left from the existing 8 in column9, but the 3s block them. But 3s are at columns5-6. So the 8s would spread left until the 3s? But the 8s are in columns7-9. So maybe the 8s spread left three cells. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number n spreads in a certain direction for n steps. For example, 1 spreads left, 6 down, 8 right, etc., but the number of steps depends on the value. But the numbers in the examples don't match their spreading steps. For example, 1 spreads left several cells, which is more than 1 step. So that's probably not it.\n\nAlternatively, each number spreads in their respective direction until they hit a non-zero cell. So:\n\n- 1s spread left in their row.\n\n- 6s spread down in their column.\n\n- 8s spread right in their row.\n\n- 7s spread up in their column.\n\nBut let's check Example 1. There's a 7 in row 0, column1. In the output, row 2, column3 has a 7. How does that happen? Maybe 7s spread down. The 7 at row0, column1 would spread down through the column until blocked. Row0, column1's 7 is in output. Then in row2, column3, there's a 7. But that's a different column. So maybe 7s spread diagonally? Alternatively, maybe 7s spread to the right and down. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number type has a different direction of spread. For example:\n\n1: left\n\n6: down\n\n7: up\n\n8: right\n\n3: forms blocks and no spread.\n\nIn Example 0, the 1 at row3, column8 spreads left to column4, filling those cells.\n\nThe 6s in the input of Example0 are at various positions. Let's take the 6 at row1, column8. If 6 spreads down, then in the output, there should be 6s in rows 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 in column8. But in the output, row1, column8 is still 6, and others are 0 except for row5, column2. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe 6s spread down but are blocked by non-zero cells. For example, in Example0's input, the 6 at row1, column8. Let's check the cells below in column8. Row2, column8 is 0. Row3, column8 is 1. So when spreading down, the 6 would stop at row2, since row3 has a 1. But in the output, there's no 6 in row2, column8. So that theory might be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s in the input are being moved down as far as possible, stacking on top of each other. For example, each 6 falls down until it hits another number or the bottom. Let's look at Example0's input. The 6 at row8, column2. In the output, rows5-8, column2 have 6s. So if the 6 at row8 falls down as far as possible, but row8 is near the bottom. Wait, rows are 0-9. So row8 is the 9th row. So it can't fall further. But in the output, there's a 6 at row5, column2. How did that get there? Maybe other 6s are moving. For example, the 6 at row6, column7 in the input. If it falls down, but row6 is already there. Hmm, maybe this is a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves each number type creating a line in a certain direction. For example, 1 creates a horizontal line to the left, 6 creates a vertical line downward, 8 creates a horizontal line to the right, and 7 creates a vertical line upward. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nExample0:\n\n- The 1 at row3, column8 creates a line left to column4 (since 3s are at columns2-3), so filled 1s from 4-8.\n\n- The 6s: each 6 in the input creates a vertical line downward. Let's take the 6 at row1, column8. Spreading down in column8. But row2, column8 is 0, row3 has 1 (blocked), so only row1 has 6. The 6 at row6, column7: spreading down from row6, column7. The rows below are row7,8,9. Row7, column7 is 6 in input (original 6 there?), but in output, row7 has 6 in column6. Wait, maybe the spreading is not additive but overlapping. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are \"painting\" their path in their respective directions. For example, each 1 in the input paints all cells to the left until a non-zero cell. Each 6 paints all cells below until a non-zero. Each 8 paints to the right, and 7 paints upwards. This seems to fit some examples.\n\nIn Example2, the 1 in row1, column4 paints downward, so all cells below in column4 until a non-zero. The next non-zero in column4 is row6, column4 (which is 3). So the 1s are added from row1 to row5 in column4.\n\nIn Example1, the 8 at row0, column6 would paint to the right. So columns7-9 in row0. But in output, row0's 8 is still at column6, so maybe it's not that. Alternatively, maybe the 8 in row2, column9 paints to the left. So columns7-9 in row2 become 8s. That fits. The original 8 is at column9, so painting left until blocked. The next non-zero to the left is the 3s at columns5-6. So the 8 spreads left from 9 to7, as columns7-9. So row2, columns7-9 become 8s.\n\nSimilarly, the 7 in row2, column3. If 7s spread upwards, then from row2, column3 upwards. But row2 is the third row (0-based), so rows0-2. The existing 7 in row0, column1 is not in the same column. Maybe 7s spread upwards in their column. So the 7 at row2, column3 would spread up to row0. Let's check Example1's output. Row2, column3 has 7, and in rows0 and1 of column3, there are zeros. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 7s spread downward. The 7 in row0, column1 would spread down. Let's see: output rows1-8 in column1. But in output, row8, column1 is 7, but others are zero. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number type has a different rule. This is getting a bit confusing, but let's try to codify the rules based on the examples.\n\nProposed rules:\n\n1. For each cell with value n:\n\n   a. If n is 1: Fill all cells to the left in the same row until a non-zero cell is encountered (excluding that cell).\n\n   b. If n is 6: Fill all cells below in the same column until a non-zero cell is encountered.\n\n   c. If n is 3: No change (they form blocks).\n\n   d. If n is 7: Fill all cells above in the same column until a non-zero cell.\n\n   e. If n is 8: Fill all cells to the right in the same row until a non-zero cell.\n\n   f. For other numbers, possibly similar rules based on their value.\n\nNow, let's check these rules against the examples.\n\nExample0:\n\n- 1 at (3,8) (row3, column8): fills left until 3s at columns2-3. So columns4-8 become 1s. Which matches the output.\n\n- 6s: Let's take the 6 at (8,2) (row8, column2). Fill below it in column2. But row8 is the last row (assuming 0-based), so no cells below. But in the output, there are 6s in rows5-8, column2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe 6s fill upward? Or maybe they spread downward but starting from their position.\n\nWait, in the input of Example0, the 6s are at:\n\nRow1, column8.\n\nRow6, column7.\n\nRow7, column6.\n\nRow8, column2.\n\nIn the output, additional 6s are in:\n\nRow5, column2.\n\nRow6, column2.\n\nRow7, column2.\n\nRow8, column2.\n\nAlso, row6, column7 remains 6.\n\nSo the 6s in row8, column2 leads to 6s in rows5-8, column2. How?\n\nThis suggests that each 6 in the input creates a vertical line upward. For example, the 6 at row8, column2 would fill cells above it until a non-zero cell. So from row8 down to row5, column2. But why row5?\n\nLooking at the input's column2:\n\nRow3 and4 have 3s in columns2-3, so rows3 and4, columns2-3 are 3s. So for the 6 at row8, column2, when filling upward, it would go from row8 up to row5 (since row5 is the first row where there's a non-zero cell (row5, column2 is 0 in input). Wait, no. The 3s are in rows3 and4. So from row8 upward:\n\nRow8: 6.\n\nRow7: column2 is 0 in input.\n\nRow6: column2 is 0.\n\nRow5: column2 is 0.\n\nRow4: column2 is 3.\n\nSo when the 6 at row8 spreads upward, it would fill rows5,6,7,8 in column2, stopping at row4's 3. So the output adds 6s from row5 to 8 in column2. That matches Example0's output.\n\nSo the rule for 6 is: fill all cells above in the same column until a non-zero cell is encountered. Wait, no, because filling upward would be rows decreasing. So if a 6 is at row8, filling upward would be rows7,6,5,... until a non-zero. But in this case, the 6 at row8, column2 is the only 6 in that column. The cells above are zeros until row4, which has a 3. So the 6 should fill rows5,6,7,8? But how does that happen. Because row8 is the starting point, and moving up to row7,6,5. But why row5? Unless the 6 is filling all cells from its position upward until blocked, but in this case, the 3 in row4 blocks it, so the 6 fills up to row5 (since row4 has the 3). So rows5-8 in column2 get 6s. That fits.\n\nSimilarly, the 6 at row7, column6 in the input. Filling upward in column6 until a non-zero. Let's check column6 in Example0's input:\n\nRow7, column6:6.\n\nRows0-6 in column6 are 0. So when filling upward, the 6 at row7 would fill rows0-7. But in the output, row7, column6 is 6, and rows6 and7 in column6 are 6. Wait, Example0's output has in row6, column7 as 6, which is different. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 6 creates a vertical line downward from its position until a non-zero cell. So the 6 at row8, column2 would fill downward, but since it's already at the bottom (row8), there's nowhere to go. But the output has 6s in rows5-8, column2. So perhaps multiple 6s are being processed in a certain order. Maybe all 6s are processed, and their effects stack. For example, the 6 at row8, column2 is processed first, filling upward until row5. Then other 6s are processed. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: look at the test input and see what needs to be transformed. The test input has 2s, 6s, 3s, and 2s again.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow3: [6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0]\n\nAssuming the rules are:\n\n- 2s spread in a certain direction.\n\n- 6s spread downward.\n\n- 3s are blocks.\n\nBut what direction do 2s spread? Let's hypothesize based on the examples.\n\nIn Example0, there's a 1 that spreads left.\n\nIn Example1, 7s and 8s spread in other directions.\n\nIn the test input, the numbers are 2,6,3. So perhaps:\n\n- 2s spread in a certain direction, say right.\n\n- 6s spread down.\n\n- 3s remain.\n\nAlternatively, 2s spread upward or another direction.\n\nBut since there's no training example with 2s, I'll have to infer. However, looking at the test input's 6s:\n\nRow3, column0: 6.\n\nRow4, column7:6.\n\nRow6, column0:6.\n\nRow9, column3 and5:6.\n\nApplying the rule that 6s spread downward (fill all cells below until a non-zero):\n\nFor row3, column0's 6: spread down from row3 to row9 in column0. But check for non-zero cells in column0.\n\nRow3 has 6. Rows4-9, column0: row4 has 0, row5 0, row6 has 6, row7 0, row8 0, row9 0.\n\nSo from row3's 6 in column0, it would spread down until row6's 6. So cells row3-5 in column0 would be 6. But row6 already has a 6. So the output for column0 would be 6s from row3 to row6. But row3 is 6, row4-5 would be filled with 6, and row6's existing 6 remains.\n\nSimilarly, row6's 6 in column0: spreads down to row9. But row7,8,9 in column0 are 0. So they become 6s.\n\nSo row6's 6 would spread down to row9, column0.\n\nRow4's 6 at column7: spreads down. Check column7. Row4's 6 is at row4. Rows5-9 in column7:\n\nRow5:0, row6:0, row7:0, row8:2, row9:0.\n\nSo spread down until row8's 2. So rows4-7 in column7 become 6s.\n\nRow9's 6s at columns3 and5: spread down, but they are in row9 (last row), so no change.\n\nRow6's 3,3 block: remains as is.\n\nNow, the 2s:\n\nTest input has 2s at:\n\nRow0, column3.\n\nRow1, column0.\n\nRow2, column7.\n\nRow8, column7.\n\nAssuming 2s spread in a certain direction. Let's guess based on the possible patterns. Maybe 2s spread upward in their column.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow0, column3's 2: spread upward. But it's already in row0, so no change.\n\nRow1, column0's 2: spread upward to row0. So row0, column0 becomes 2. But row0, column0 is 0 in input. So output row0, column0 would be 2.\n\nRow2, column7's 2: spread upward in column7. Rows0-2. Row0, column7 is 0, row1, column7 is 0. So row0 and1, column7 become 2s.\n\nRow8, column7's 2: spread upward in column7. Rows0-7. But let's check existing values. For example, row4, column7 is 6 (input's row4, column7). So spread upward from row8's 2 to row5,6,7,8. But row4 has a 6. So the 2 in row8, column7 would fill rows5-8 in column7 with 2s, but row4's 6 blocks upward spread.\n\nWait, if 2s spread upward in their column, then:\n\nRow8, column7's 2 would fill rows7,6,5,... until a non-zero.\n\nIn column7, row8's 2. The cells above are row7 (0), row6 (0), row5 (0), row4 (6). So from row8's 2, spread upward until row5, since row4 has 6. So rows5-8, column7 become 2s. But row4's 6 is in row4, which is above row5. So rows5-8, column7 would be 2s.\n\nBut in the input, row4, column7 is 6. So in the output, the 2s would be from row5-8, column7.\n\nBut in the output, how would this interact with the 6s spreading down from row4's 6 in column7. According to the 6's rule, row4's 6 in column7 would spread down until a non-zero. So rows4-7, column7 would become 6s. But if the 2s are in rows5-8, column7, there's a conflict. So which takes precedence?\n\nAh, perhaps the processing order matters. Maybe the numbers are processed in a certain order, like higher numbers override lower ones, or vice versa. Alternatively, all transformations are applied simultaneously, and if a cell is affected by multiple numbers, the highest number takes precedence.\n\nLooking back at the training examples. In Example1, the output row2 has 7,7,3,3,8,8,8. So in that row, the 7 is at column3 and4, then 3s, then 8s. So if multiple numbers are trying to affect the same cell, the highest number may take precedence. So numbers with higher values overwrite lower ones.\n\nIn Example1's input, row2 has a 7 at column3 and an 8 at column9. The output has 7s in columns3-4, 3s in5-6, and 8s in7-9. So the 7s and 8s are adjacent, with the 8s to the right. So perhaps when spreading, higher numbers override lower ones when they conflict.\n\nSo in the test input's column7, the 6 at row4 would spread down, and the 2 at row8 would spread up. The 6s are higher than 2s, so they take precedence. But in the output, row4's 6 spreads down to rows5-7, making them 6s, and the 2's spread up from row8 to rows5-8. So there's a conflict in rows5-7, column7. Since 6 is higher than 2, the 6s would overwrite the 2s. So rows5-7, column7 would be 6s, and row8, column7 is 2.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. I need to apply the rules step by step for the test input.\n\nLet's outline the steps for the test input:\n\n1. Process all 6s first, as they spread downward.\n\nFor each 6 in the input:\n\n- Fill all cells below in the same column with 6 until a non-zero cell is encountered.\n\nBut wait, in the proposed rule for 6, it's filling downward. So for a 6 at row r, column c:\n\nFill cells r+1, r+2, ..., until a non-zero cell is found (excluding that cell).\n\nSo for the test input's 6s:\n\nRow3, column0:6. Fill cells below it (rows4-9) in column0 until a non-zero. But row6, column0 has a 6. So the 6 from row3 spreads down to row5, and the existing 6 in row6 is already there. So rows3-5, column0 are 6s. Then row6's 6 spreads down to rows7-9. So column0 becomes:\n\nRow3:6\n\nRow4:6\n\nRow5:6\n\nRow6:6 (original)\n\nRow7:6\n\nRow8:6\n\nRow9:6\n\nBut wait, row6's 6 is part of the input and would also spread down. So after processing all 6s:\n\n- 6 at row3, column0: fills rows4-5.\n\n- 6 at row4, column7: fills rows5-7 (row4's 6, then rows5-7 are filled until row8's 2 in column7).\n\n- 6 at row6, column0: fills rows7-9.\n\n- 6 at row9, columns3 and5: no cells below, so no change.\n\nSo column0 becomes:\n\nRow3:6\n\nRow4:6 (from row3's spread)\n\nRow5:6 (from row3's spread)\n\nRow6:6 (original)\n\nRow7:6 (from row6's spread)\n\nRow8:6 (from row6's spread)\n\nRow9:6 (from row6's spread)\n\nNow, column7:\n\n6 at row4, column7. Spread down. Cells row5,6,7 in column7 are 0. Row8 has 2. So the 6 spreads down to row7. So column7:\n\nRow4:6\n\nRow5:6\n\nRow6:6\n\nRow7:6\n\nRow8:2 (original)\n\nRow9:0\n\nNext, process 2s. Assuming 2s spread in a certain direction. Since there's no example with 2s, I need to infer. Possible directions: maybe right, like 8s in Example1.\n\nIn Example1, 8s spread to the right. So perhaps 2s spread to the left.\n\nAlternatively, since 1s spread left, 2s might spread in another direction. Alternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the number's parity or something else.\n\nAlternatively, considering that 1,6,3,7,8 have certain directions, maybe 2s spread upward.\n\nBut without training examples, this is tricky. However, looking at the test input's 2s:\n\nRow0, column3:2. If it spreads right, filling to the end of the row until a non-zero. So columns4-9 become 2s. But in the input, row0, column3 is 2. So if 2s spread right, then columns3-9 would be 2s unless blocked.\n\nBut in the output, what would happen? Let's imagine.\n\nIf 2s spread to the right:\n\nRow0, column3's 2 would spread to columns4-9. But row0's input has other zeros. So the output would have 2s from column3 to9 in row0.\n\nRow1, column0's 2 would spread to the right until a non-zero. Row1's input is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So spreading right would fill columns0-9 with 2s unless blocked. But there's a 2 in column0. So if 2s spread to the right, then the entire row becomes 2s. But that's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, 2s spread upward in their column.\n\nRow1, column0's 2 would spread upward to row0, column0. So row0, column0 becomes 2.\n\nRow0, column3's 2 would spread upward (but it's row0, so no change).\n\nRow2, column7's 2 would spread upward in column7 to rows0-2. So row0,1,2 column7 become 2s.\n\nRow8, column7's 2 would spread upward in column7 to rows0-8. But column7 in row4 has a 6 (from the 6's spreading). So the 2 in row8, column7 would fill upward until row5 (since row4's 6 blocks). So rows5-8, column7 would be 2s. But earlier, the 6s filled rows4-7, column7 with 6s. So if 2s have lower priority than 6s, then the 6s would overwrite the 2s in rows5-7, leaving row8, column7 as 2.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Let's try to apply the rules as we hypothesized:\n\nAssuming:\n\n- Each number n spreads in a certain direction:\n\n   1: left\n\n   2: ?\n\n   3: block\n\n   6: down\n\n   7: up\n\n   8: right\n\nBut for 2, since it's not in the training examples, we have to guess. Let's assume that 2s spread upward, similar to 7s. So:\n\n- 2: spread upward in the column until a non-zero.\n\nSo for each 2 in the input:\n\nFill all cells above in the same column with 2 until a non-zero.\n\nLet's process the test input's 2s with this rule.\n\nRow0, column3:2. No cells above, so remains.\n\nRow1, column0:2. Spread upward to row0, column0. So row0, column0 becomes 2.\n\nRow2, column7:2. Spread upward to rows0-2, column7. So rows0-2, column7 become 2s.\n\nRow8, column7:2. Spread upward to rows0-8, column7. Check column7 for non-zero cells above. Row4, column7 has a 6 (from processing 6s). So the 2 in row8 spreads upward until row5. So rows5-8, column7 become 2s.\n\nNow, the 6s and 2s in column7 would interact:\n\n- From 6s: rows4-7, column7 are 6s.\n\n- From 2s: rows5-8, column7 are 2s.\n\nAssuming higher numbers override lower ones, 6 (6) >2 (2), so rows5-7, column7 remain 6s, and row8, column7 is 2.\n\nNow, combining all these:\n\nFor column0:\n\nRow0:2 (from row1's 2 spreading up)\n\nRow1:2 (original)\n\nRows3-9:6s from 6 processing.\n\nFor column3:\n\nRow0:2 (original)\n\nRow9:6 (original)\n\nFor column7:\n\nRows0-2:2s from row2's 2 spreading up.\n\nRow4:6\n\nRows5-7:6\n\nRow8:2\n\nRow9:0.\n\nNow, the 3s in rows6 and7, columns2-3 are blocks and remain.\n\nRow6: [6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nNow, the 6s in row9, columns3 and5:\n\nRow9, column3:6. Spread down (no cells below).\n\nRow9, column5:6. Spread down.\n\nNo change.\n\nFinally, the 2s:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nNow, combining all these transformations into the output grid.\n\nBut the exact output would depend on the order of processing and priority. Given that higher numbers override lower ones, the 6s would take precedence over 2s where they overlap.\n\nPutting this all together, the final output for the test input would be something like:\n\n[2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n\n[6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n\n[6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n\n[6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's check if this aligns with the patterns.\n\nFor example, row3, column0 is 6, and rows4-9, column0 would be 6s. But in the test input's row6, column0 is 6, so processing that would spread down to rows7-9, column0. So row3's 6 spreads to rows4-5, row6's 6 spreads to rows7-9. So column0 in rows3-9 would be 6s.\n\nRow0, column0 is 2 from row1's 2 spreading up.\n\nRow0, column3 is 2, and since 2s spread upward (no change), but if 2s spread right, then row0's 2 would spread to the right. But I assumed 2s spread upward. So perhaps the 2 in row0, column3 stays as is.\n\nBut without knowing the correct direction for 2s, this is uncertain. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the best possible guess based on the patterns observed in the training examples and apply the following rules:\n\n- 1s spread left.\n\n- 6s spread down.\n\n- 2s spread upward (since 7s and 8s in training examples spread in other directions, maybe 2s spread upward).\n\n- 3s form blocks.\n\nApplying these rules to the test input, the output should be as follows.",
