        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by looking at the examples closely.\n\nFirst, let's look at Example 0. The input has rows with 0s, some 2s, and then rows of 5s. The output seems to have some 5s added in certain positions. For instance, the fifth row in the input is all 5s, and in the output, the fourth row (since rows are 0-indexed maybe?) has some 5s. Wait, in the output, the fifth row (index 4) has 5s at positions where maybe there were 2s above or below. Like in the input rows, there are 2s in certain columns, and the output's row 4 has 5s in those columns. Maybe it's merging the 2s from above and below into the 5 rows? Or perhaps it's taking the non-zero values from adjacent rows and converting them into 5s in the row where the 5s are present?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input rows 0-3 and 9-12 have 2s in various columns. The output's row 4 (0-based index 4) has 5s in columns where there were 2s in the rows immediately above or below the 5s block. Like, in the input row 8 (index 8?), no, wait, maybe the 5s are in the middle rows. Let me check the input structure again.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, rows 5-8 are all 5s. Then the output's row 4 (the row just above the 5s block) has 5s inserted. Similarly, row 9 in the input (which is below the 5s block) has a 2 in column 9. In the output, row 9 (which is index 9) in the output has a 5 in column 9. So maybe the pattern is that any non-zero value (like 2, 3, 1, etc.) in the rows adjacent to the 5s block gets converted to 5 in the 5s block's adjacent rows. Or perhaps, the 5s rows act as a kind of \"sponge\" that pull down or up the non-zero values into their own rows, converting them to 5.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the rows that were all 5s in the input remain 5s. The rows above and below the 5s block have some 5s added where there were 2s. For example, input row 8 (assuming the rows are numbered starting from 0) is part of the 5s block. The input rows above the 5s block (rows 0-3) have 2s in certain columns. The output's row 4 (the first row above the 5s block) has 5s in the same columns where there were 2s in the rows above. Similarly, the rows below the 5s block (rows 9-13 in input) have 2s, and in the output, the row below the 5s block (row 9) has 5s in those columns. So perhaps the rule is: for each column, if there's a non-zero value in the rows immediately adjacent (above or below) the 5s block, then in the row adjacent to the 5s block (the first row above or below), replace that value with 5. But in Example 0's output, row 4 (index 4) has 5s in columns where the rows above (rows 0-3) had 2s. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are spreading upwards and downwards into adjacent rows where there are non-zero values. For instance, any non-zero value in a row that is adjacent to a 5 row (either directly above or below) gets replaced by 5 in the 5s' row's adjacent row. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has rows where the 5s are in columns 4-8 (assuming 0-indexed). The non-zero values here are 3s. The output replaces some of the 3s in the adjacent rows with 5s. For example, in the first input row, there's a 3 in column 12. But the output's first row has a 5 in column 9. Hmm, maybe not. Let me look at specific rows. Take the input's first row in Example 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,3,0]. The output for this row is [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0]. So the 3 in column 12 is gone, and a 5 appears in column 9. Wait, that might not align. Alternatively, perhaps the non-zero values (3s) in the same columns as the 5s are being converted to 5s. Wait, the 5s in the input are columns 4-8. The 3s are in other columns. So maybe if a 3 is in a column adjacent (left or right) to the 5s columns, it's converted to 5. For example, in Example1's first input row, there's a 3 in column 12. But the 5s are in columns 4-8. So that's not adjacent. Hmm, maybe the 3s in rows adjacent to the 5s rows are converted. Wait, the 5s are in rows 4-8 (assuming rows are 0-indexed), but in Example1's input, the 5s are from row 0 to 13? Wait, no. Wait the input for Example1 is 14 rows. Let me check again.\n\nWait, each input is a list of 14 lists, each with 14 elements. So each input is a 14x14 grid. Looking at Example1's input: each row has 5s starting from column 4 to 8 (indices 4-8). So columns 4-8 are 5s. The other columns have 0s or 3s. The output in Example1 seems to turn some 3s into 5s. For example, the first input row has a 3 in column 12, but the output row has a 5 in column 9. Wait, maybe the pattern is that any non-zero value (like 3) in the same row as the 5s (but in columns outside 4-8) are being converted to 5s in the nearest column of the 5s block. Or maybe if there's a non-zero in a row that contains 5s, then in that row, any non-zero in the same row but outside the 5s columns gets converted to 5 in the adjacent column. Alternatively, maybe the 5s are expanding to the left or right into columns where there are non-zero values in adjacent rows.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the third training example, Example2. The input has 1s and 5s. The output converts some 1s into 5s. For instance, in the input row 6 (assuming rows start at 0), which is [5,5,5...], but the output's row 6 has some 5s where there were 1s in adjacent rows. Wait, the 5s are in rows 7 and 8 (indexes 7 and 8) in the input. The output's row 6 (index 6) has 5s in columns where there were 1s in the rows above. For example, in input row 5, there's a 1 in column 8. In output row 6, column 8 is 5. Similarly, input row 3 has 1s in columns 3,7,12. Output row 6 has 5s in column 3,7, and 5 in column 12 (if any). Wait, in output row 6: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,5,0]. So columns 3,7,8,12. But in the input, rows above (like row 3) have 1s in columns 3,7,12. Row 5 has 1 in column 8. So perhaps the 5s are appearing in the row just below the 5s block (since the 5s block is rows 7-8). So row 6 is adjacent to the 5s block. So any 1s in the rows above (rows 0-6) in the same column as where 1s are, get converted to 5s in the adjacent row (row 6) in the output. Similarly, rows below the 5s block (rows 9-13) have 1s, and in the output row 9 (which is adjacent to the 5s block?), 5s appear in columns where there were 1s.\n\nSo putting it together, the pattern seems to be: For each column, if there is a non-zero value in any row above or below the block of 5s, then in the row adjacent to the 5s block (the first row above or below the 5s block), replace that position with 5. But how exactly is the 5s block determined?\n\nWait, in Example0, the 5s block is rows 5-8. In the input, rows 5-8 are all 5s. The output's row4 (the row just above the 5s block) has 5s in columns where the rows above (rows0-3) had 2s. Similarly, the row9 (just below the 5s block) has 5s in columns where the rows below (rows9-13) had 2s. So the rule could be: For each column, check the rows above the 5s block. If any of those rows in that column have a non-zero value, then in the first row above the 5s block (row4 in Example0), set that column to 5. Similarly, check the rows below the 5s block. If any of them have a non-zero in that column, set the first row below the 5s block (row9 in Example0) to 5 in that column. The 5s block itself remains unchanged, and other rows not adjacent to the 5s block become all zeros, except for any non-zeros that might be converted.\n\nIn Example1, the 5s are in columns4-8 across all rows. Wait, no. Looking at Example1's input, each row has 5s in columns4-8. So the entire grid has 5s in columns4-8 for every row. Wait, no. Let me check. The first input row of Example1 is [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,3,0]. So columns4-8 are 5s, others are 0 except column12 has a 3. The output for that row is [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0]. So the 3 in column12 is gone, and a 5 is added in column9. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are in columns4-8, and any non-zero (like 3) in the same row but outside columns4-8, when present, causes the 5s to expand into the nearest column towards that non-zero. For example, the 3 in column12 of the first input row is to the right of the 5s. So in the output, the 5s expand rightward into column9. But why column9? Because maybe for each non-zero in the same row, the 5s expand in that direction. But column9 is to the right of the 5s block (columns4-8). So expanding from column8 to column9.\n\nWait, in Example1's first input row, there's a 3 in column12. The output adds a 5 in column9. So perhaps the 5s are expanding towards the direction of the non-zero. If there's a non-zero to the right of the 5s in a row, then the rightmost 5 column extends to the right. Similarly, if there's a non-zero to the left, the leftmost 5 column extends left. But in this case, the 3 is in column12, which is far to the right. So why expand only to column9?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of any non-zero in a row (outside the 5s columns) causes the 5s to fill the entire row. But that's not the case. For example, in Example1's first input row, the output only extends the 5s to column9, not the entire row. Hmm. This is getting confusing.\n\nLet me approach this systematically. Let's look at the three examples and try to find common patterns.\n\nIn all examples, the input has a block of 5s (or another number, but in the examples given, the 5s are the main ones). The output modifies certain rows adjacent to the 5s block by replacing some zeros with 5s, based on the presence of non-zero values in other rows.\n\nIn Example0:\n\n- The 5s are in rows5-8 (all 5s).\n- The rows above (0-4) and below (9-13) have some 2s.\n- In the output, the row immediately above the 5s (row4) has 5s in columns where any of the rows above (0-3) had 2s.\n- Similarly, the row immediately below the 5s (row9) has 5s in columns where any of the rows below (10-13) had 2s.\n\nSo, for each column, if there's a 2 in any row above the 5s block (rows0-3), then row4 (adjacent above) in that column becomes 5. Similarly, if there's a 2 in any row below the 5s block (rows9-13), then row9 (adjacent below) in that column becomes 5.\n\nIn Example1:\n\n- The 5s are in columns4-8 for all rows. So it's a vertical block spanning all rows but only columns4-8.\n- The input has 3s scattered in other columns.\n- The output seems to expand the 5s into adjacent columns where there are 3s in the same row. For example, in the first input row, there's a 3 in column12. The output's first row extends the 5s to column9. Wait, but 3 is in column12, which is far away. How does that relate to expanding to column9?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each row, if there's a non-zero (3) in that row, the 5s expand to the leftmost or rightmost column where the non-zero is. But in the first input row, the 3 is in column12, which is to the right of the 5s columns (4-8). The output adds a 5 in column9. So maybe the 5s expand one column to the right for each non-zero in that row. But in that case, why column9 and not column12?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of any non-zero (3) in a row (regardless of column) causes the 5s to expand to fill the entire row. But in Example1's first row, the output doesn't fill the entire row with 5s. Only columns4-9 become 5s. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at Example1's output rows, it seems that the 5s columns have expanded to the right in some rows. For example, the first row's 5s now go up to column9. The third row in the input has a 3 in column3 (left of the 5s columns), and the output's third row has 5s starting from column3. So maybe if there's a non-zero to the left or right of the 5s columns in a row, the 5s expand to include that column.\n\nFor instance, in a row with 5s in columns4-8:\n\n- If there's a non-zero in column3, then the 5s expand left to column3.\n- If there's a non-zero in column9, they expand right to column9.\n\nIn Example1's first input row, there's a 3 in column12 (far right), but the output's 5s expand to column9. Why not all the way to column12? Maybe the expansion is only one step towards the non-zero. Or perhaps the expansion covers all columns between the 5s and the non-zero.\n\nWait, let's look at the first input row of Example1: columns4-8 are 5s, column9 is 0, column10-12 are 0 except column12 has a 3. The output row's 5s are now columns4-9. So the expansion is to the next column (9) even though the non-zero is further away. That doesn't make sense. Unless there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero (3) is in column12, which is in the same row, so the 5s expand to cover from column4 up to the column of the non-zero. But that would mean columns4-12, but the output only has 5s up to column9. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is to the nearest column where a non-zero exists in any row. For example, if any row has a non-zero in a column adjacent to the 5s block, then that column becomes part of the 5s block in all rows. But in Example1, the output's first row extends to column9, which might be because another row has a non-zero in column9.\n\nLooking at Example1's input:\n\n- The second input row has a 3 in column9.\n- The third input row has a 3 in column3 and column11.\n- The seventh input row has a 3 in column10 and 12.\n- The tenth input row has a 3 in column12.\n\nIn the output, some rows have expanded 5s into columns3,9,10, etc. For example, the third output row has 5s starting from column3. The seventh output row has 5s up to column10. So maybe the 5s columns expand to include any column where there's a non-zero in any row, either to the left or right of the original 5s columns (4-8). So if any row has a non-zero in column3, then all rows' 5s expand left to column3. Similarly for columns to the right.\n\nBut in Example1's output, not all rows have expanded to the same columns. For instance, the first output row has 5s up to column9, while others go further. This suggests that the expansion is per-row, not globally.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, if there's a non-zero (3) in that row, then the 5s expand to include that column. For example, if a row has a 3 in column9, then in that row, the 5s extend to column9. If another row has a 3 in column3, then in that row, the 5s extend to column3. This would explain why different rows have different expansions.\n\nLooking at Example1's output:\n\n- The first input row has a 3 in column12. Output row has 5s up to column9. Wait, that doesn't align. Unless there's a maximum expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expansion is to the nearest non-zero column. For example, in a row with a non-zero at column12, the 5s expand rightward until they reach the first non-zero column. But that would require expanding to column12, which doesn't happen.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLooking at Example2:\n\n- The 5s are in rows7-8 (all columns).\n- The input has 1s in various columns in rows above and below.\n- The output's row6 (just above the 5s block) has 5s in columns where there were 1s in the rows above. Similarly, row9 (just below the 5s block) has 5s in columns where there were 1s in the rows below.\n\nSo the pattern here is similar to Example0. For any column that has a non-zero (1) in the rows above the 5s block, the first row above the 5s block (row6) in that column becomes 5. Similarly for rows below.\n\nPutting it all together, the common pattern across all examples is:\n\n1. Identify the contiguous block of rows that are all 5s. For example, in Example0, it's rows5-8. In Example2, rows7-8.\n\n2. For the rows immediately adjacent above and below this block (the first row above and the first row below), check all columns. If any row in the area above the 5s block (any row above the 5s block) has a non-zero in a particular column, then the adjacent row above the 5s block (the first row above) gets a 5 in that column. Similarly for the rows below: if any row below the 5s block has a non-zero in a column, the adjacent row below gets a 5 in that column.\n\n3. Additionally, for any rows that are part of the 5s block, they remain 5s.\n\n4. Other rows (not adjacent to the 5s block) have their non-zero values replaced with 0, except possibly if they are part of expanding the 5s in other ways.\n\nWait, but in Example1, the 5s are not in a contiguous block of rows. Instead, each row has a block of 5s in columns4-8. So perhaps the pattern there is different. Maybe it's about columns rather than rows.\n\nAlternatively, in Example1, the 5s form a vertical stripe (columns4-8) across all rows. The output expands this stripe to include columns where there are non-zero values (3s) in any row. For example, if any row has a 3 in column3, then column3 is added to the 5s stripe in all rows. Similarly for other columns. But in the output, some rows have expanded columns while others don't, which contradicts this.\n\nAlternatively, for each row in Example1, if there's a non-zero (3) in that row outside the 5s columns, then the 5s in that row expand to include the column of the non-zero. So in rows where there's a 3 to the left of the 5s, the 5s expand left; if to the right, expand right. For example, the third input row has a 3 in column3 (left of 5s columns), so the output's third row has 5s starting from column3. Similarly, the seventh input row has 3s in columns10 and12, so the output's seventh row expands the 5s to column10.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the rule for Example1 is: in each row that contains 5s, if there's a non-zero (3) in that row outside the 5s columns, expand the 5s to include that column. But how far? For example, in the first input row of Example1, the 3 is in column12, but the output's 5s expand to column9. Maybe the expansion is only to the first non-zero column in each direction.\n\nAlternatively, it's possible that the 5s expand to cover all contiguous columns from the original 5s block up to the non-zero column. For example, if there's a non-zero in column12, but between columns8 and12 there are zeros, maybe the 5s don't expand there. But in the first input row of Example1, columns9-11 are zeros, and column12 has a 3. The output's 5s expand to column9. That doesn't fit. So perhaps the expansion is only to adjacent columns where there's a non-zero in the same row.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to see if there's a unifying pattern across all examples.\n\nThe key might be that the 5s block (whether horizontal or vertical) acts as a source, and non-zero values in adjacent rows or columns cause the 5s to spread into those areas.\n\nIn Example0 and Example2, the 5s are in a horizontal block (rows). The non-zero values in the rows above and below cause the 5s to spread into the immediately adjacent rows, replacing those positions with 5s.\n\nIn Example1, the 5s are in a vertical block (columns). The non-zero values in the same rows but different columns cause the 5s to spread into those columns.\n\nSo maybe the general rule is:\n\n- Identify the contiguous block of 5s (either a horizontal block of rows or a vertical block of columns).\n- For rows adjacent to the block (above and below if it's a horizontal block), check if any non-zero values exist in the same column in the rows outside the block. Replace those positions in the adjacent row with 5s.\n- For columns adjacent to the block (left and right if it's a vertical block), check if any non-zero values exist in the same row in the columns outside the block. Replace those positions in the adjacent column with 5s.\n\nBut how to determine whether it's a horizontal or vertical block? In Example0, the 5s are a horizontal block (rows5-8, all columns). In Example1, it's a vertical block (columns4-8, all rows). In Example2, it's a horizontal block (rows7-8, all columns).\n\nSo the pattern depends on whether the 5s form a horizontal or vertical block. For horizontal blocks, the spreading is to adjacent rows. For vertical blocks, the spreading is to adjacent columns.\n\nBut how to apply this to the test input?\n\nThe test input is:\n\nEach row has 5s in columns5 and6 (indices5 and6). So it's a vertical block of two columns (5 and6) across all 14 rows. The non-zero values are 4s in various columns. For example, row1 has a 4 in column2 and9. Row3 has a4 in column3. Row4 has a4 in column1. Row6 has a4 in column7 and11. Row11 has4s in columns1,3, and10. Row13 has a4 in column13.\n\nFollowing the pattern from Example1 (vertical block), the 5s would spread into adjacent columns (columns4 and7, since the block is columns5-6). For each row, if there's a non-zero (4) in that row outside the 5s columns, the 5s expand to include the column of the non-zero. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each row, if there's a non-zero (4) in columns left or right of the 5s block (columns5-6), then the 5s in that row expand to include those columns. For example, in row1, there's a4 in column2 (left) and9 (right). So the 5s in that row would expand left to column2 and right to column9. But the output would then have 5s from column2 to9? Or perhaps only the columns where the non-zero is present?\n\nAlternatively, the expansion is per-column. If any row in the vertical block (columns5-6) has a non-zero in a column adjacent (left or right), then the entire column is added to the 5s block. For example, if there's a4 in column4 (left of 5) or7 (right of6), then columns4 or7 become part of the 5s block.\n\nBut in the test input, the 5s are in columns5-6. The non-zero 4s are in columns1,2,3,7,9,10,11,13. So applying the vertical block rule from Example1, the 5s would expand into columns where there are non-zero values in any row. For example, if any row has a4 in column2, then column2 is added to the 5s block. But this seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, if there's a non-zero (4) in that row to the left or right of the 5s columns (5-6), then the 5s expand in that row to include those columns. For example, in row1 of the test input, there are4s in columns2 and9. So the 5s in row1 would expand left to include column2 and right to include column9. So the output for row1 would have 5s from column2 to9. But how to handle multiple non-zeros in the same row.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s expand to cover all columns between the original 5s columns and the non-zero columns. For example, in row1, the 4s are in column2 and9. The 5s would expand left to column2 and right to column9, making the 5s from 2-9 in that row.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's see what the training examples suggest.\n\nIn Example1, the input rows have 5s in columns4-8. The output for a row with a3 in column3 (left) expands the 5s to column3. For a row with a3 in column9, the 5s expand to column9. So in that case, each row's 5s expand to include any non-zero in that row, left or right.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFor each row, check if there are any non-zero (4) values to the left or right of columns5-6. If yes, expand the 5s in that row to include those columns.\n\nSo for row0: no non-zeros, so columns5-6 remain 5s.\n\nRow1: non-zeros in columns2 and9. So expand left to column2 and right to column9. So columns2-9 become 5s.\n\nRow2: no non-zeros, so remains columns5-6.\n\nRow3: non-zero in column3 (left). Expand left to column3. So columns3-6 become 5s.\n\nRow4: non-zero in column1 (left). Expand left to column1. So columns1-6.\n\nRow5: no non-zeros, columns5-6.\n\nRow6: non-zeros in column7 (right of6) and11 (far right). So expand right to column11. So columns5-11.\n\nRow7: no non-zeros, columns5-6.\n\nRow8: same as row7.\n\nRow9: same as row7.\n\nRow10: same as row7.\n\nRow11: non-zeros in columns1,3,10. So expand left to column1 and right to column10. So columns1-10.\n\nRow12: no non-zeros, columns5-6.\n\nRow13: non-zero in column13 (far right). Expand right to column13. So columns5-13.\n\nSo the output would have rows where the 5s are expanded based on the presence of 4s in each row.\n\nBut wait, the output examples for the training examples have the same 5s block but with some expansions. For example, in Example1's output, the first row's 5s are columns4-9. The input's first row had a3 in column12, but the expansion is only to column9. This suggests that the expansion might not be to the furthest non-zero but to the nearest non-zero adjacent to the 5s block.\n\nAlternatively, the expansion is to the first non-zero encountered when moving left or right from the 5s block. For example, in a row with non-zeros at column2 and9, the 5s expand to cover from the leftmost non-zero to the rightmost non-zero. Or perhaps from the original 5s columns to the leftmost and rightmost non-zero.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nIn Example1's output, the rows that have non-zeros in the same row have their 5s expanded to include the columns of those non-zeros. So for a row with a3 in column3, the 5s expand left to column3. For a row with a3 in column9, expand right to column9. For a row with a3 in column3 and9, expand from3 to9.\n\nIf this is the case, then the test input's rows would have their 5s expanded to include all columns from the leftmost non-zero to the rightmost non-zero in that row, merging with the original 5s columns.\n\nFor example, row1 in the test input has 4s in columns2 and9. The original 5s are in columns5-6. So the leftmost non-zero is column2, rightmost is9. So the 5s would expand from2 to9.\n\nSimilarly, row6 has 4s in columns7 and11. Original 5s in5-6. So expand from5-6 to7 and11. So columns5-11.\n\nRow11 has4s in columns1,3,10. Leftmost is1, rightmost is10. So expand from1-10.\n\nRow13 has4 in13. Expand from5-6 to13. So columns5-13.\n\nBut this would mean that the 5s fill all columns between the leftmost and rightmost non-zeros in the same row, including the original 5s columns.\n\nIf this is the pattern, then the output for the test input would have rows expanded based on the non-zeros in each row.\n\nBut how to handle overlapping ranges. For example, row11's non-zeros are in columns1,3,10. So leftmost is1, rightmost is10. So the 5s would cover columns1-10.\n\nApplying this to all rows of the test input:\n\nRow0: no non-zeros. 5s remain in5-6.\n\nRow1: non-zeros in2 and9. So 5s in2-9.\n\nRow2: no non-zeros. 5s in5-6.\n\nRow3: non-zero in3. So 5s in3-6.\n\nRow4: non-zero in1. So5s in1-6.\n\nRow5: no non-zeros.5s in5-6.\n\nRow6: non-zeros in7 and11. So5s in5-11.\n\nRow7: no non-zeros.5s in5-6.\n\nRow8: same as7.\n\nRow9: same as7.\n\nRow10: same as7.\n\nRow11: non-zeros in1,3,10. So5s in1-10.\n\nRow12: same as7.\n\nRow13: non-zero in13. So5s in5-13.\n\nThis would be the expected output.\n\nNow, let's check if this aligns with the training examples.\n\nIn Example1's first row, non-zero at column12. So leftmost and rightmost non-zero is12. But the output's 5s are in columns4-9. That doesn't align. Wait, this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expansion is only to the immediate adjacent columns where there are non-zeros. For example, in a row with non-zeros in columns2 and9, the 5s expand to include those specific columns, but not the ones in between. But that's not how it works in Example1.\n\nIn Example1's third row, the input has a3 in column3. The output's third row has 5s starting from column3. So the 5s expand left from columns4-8 to include column3. So the new 5s columns are3-8. The row's non-zero is in3, so the expansion is to include column3.\n\nIn row7 of Example1's input, there are 3s in columns10 and12. The output's row7 has 5s up to column10. So the 5s expand from4-8 to4-10. So in this case, the rightmost expansion is to the first non-zero encountered when moving right. Or maybe it's expanding to include all consecutive columns up to the first non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, the expansion is to include all columns from the original 5s block to the leftmost and rightmost non-zero in the same row, but only if they are adjacent. For example, if there's a non-zero in column3 and the original 5s start at4, then column3 is added. If there's a non-zero in column5, which is already part of the 5s block, no change. If there's a non-zero in column9, and the original 5s end at8, then column9 is added.\n\nIn the test input's row1, the non-zeros are in2 and9. The original 5s are in5-6. So expanding left to2 and right to9 would make the 5s from2 to9. But that would require filling columns2-9 with 5s. But how does that align with the training examples?\n\nIn Example1's first input row, the non-zero is in column12, so the 5s expand from4-8 to4-9. But why stop at9? Maybe because there's a non-zero in column9 in another row. Let's check Example1's input. The second row has a3 in column9. So maybe if any row has a non-zero in a column, that column is added to all rows' 5s blocks.\n\nBut in Example1's output, not all rows have the same expansion. For example, the first row's 5s go to column9, but the seventh row's go to column10. This suggests that the expansion is per-row, not global.\n\nThis is really tricky. Another approach: in each example, what's the difference between input and output.\n\nIn Example0:\n\n- The output adds 5s in the row above and below the 5s block, in columns where there were non-zeros (2s) in the respective areas.\n\nIn Example1:\n\n- The output expands the 5s columns to include columns where there were non-zeros (3s) in the same row.\n\nIn Example2:\n\n- The output adds 5s in the row above and below the 5s block, in columns where there were non-zeros (1s) in the respective areas.\n\nSo, the pattern depends on whether the 5s are in a horizontal or vertical block.\n\nFor the test input, the 5s are in columns5-6 across all rows (vertical block). So applying the rule from Example1: for each row, expand the 5s to include any columns where there are non-zeros (4s) in that row.\n\nSo for each row, the 5s should expand left to the leftmost non-zero column and right to the rightmost non-zero column, covering all columns in between.\n\nFor example, row1 has non-zeros in2 and9. So the 5s expand to columns2-9.\n\nRow3 has non-zero in3. So expand to3-6.\n\nRow4 has non-zero in1. Expand to1-6.\n\nRow6 has non-zeros in7 and11. Expand to5-11.\n\nRow11 has non-zeros in1,3,10. Expand to1-10.\n\nRow13 has non-zero in13. Expand to5-13.\n\nOther rows remain as 5s in5-6.\n\nSo the output would look like this for each row:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 remains same.\n\nRow1: [0,0,4,0,0,5,5,0,0,4,0,0,0,0] \u2192 expand to columns2-9: 0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 same as row0.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,4,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 expand to columns3-6: 0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nRow4: [0,4,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 expand to columns1-6: 0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nRow5: same as row0.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,4,0,0,0,4,0,0] \u2192 expand to columns5-11: 0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0.\n\nRow7-10: same as row0.\n\nRow11: [0,4,0,4,0,5,5,0,0,0,4,0,0,0] \u2192 expand to columns1-10: 0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0.\n\nRow12: same as row0.\n\nRow13: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,4,0] \u2192 expand to columns5-13: 0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5.\n\nBut wait, in the test input, the 5s are in columns5 and6 (indices5 and6) of each row. Expanding to include columns between the leftmost and rightmost non-zero in each row would mean merging those columns into the 5s. So for example, row1's leftmost non-zero is2, rightmost is9. So columns2-9 become5s. So the row would be [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0].\n\nSimilarly, row6's non-zeros are in7 and11, so columns5-11 become5s: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0].\n\nRow11's non-zeros are in1,3,10. Leftmost is1, rightmost is10. So columns1-10 become5s: [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0].\n\nRow13's non-zero is13. Rightmost is13, so columns5-13 become5s: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5].\n\nApplying this pattern, the output for the test input would be each row's 5s expanded to cover from the leftmost to rightmost non-zero column (including the original 5s columns5-6) and filling those with 5s.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 14x14 grid of numbers, and the output is another grid. The challenge is to determine how the input is transformed into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has several rows with 0s and a few 2s, followed by some rows of all 5s, then more 0s and 2s. The output seems to have some 5s introduced where there were 2s in the input. For instance, in the input rows with 2s, the output rows below the block of 5s have 5s inserted at positions corresponding to where the 2s were. Also, the rows that were all 5s in the input remain 5s in the output. So maybe the 2s are markers that cause 5s to appear in the output, but shifted down or up?\n\nWait, let's look at the positions. In Example 0's input, the first 2 is at row 0, column 8. The output in row 4, column 2 and 8, there's a 5. Hmm, maybe there's a vertical shift. Like, the position of the 2 in the input is moved down by a certain number of rows? Let me check other positions. Another 2 is in row 2, column 2. In the output, row 4, column 2 has a 5. That's a shift of +2 rows. Another 2 in input row 3, column 10. Output row 4, column 10 is 5. So shifting down by 1 row? Wait, row 3 to row 4 is +1. But the first example's 2 in row 0, column 8 becomes row 4, column 8. That's +4 rows. Hmm, that's inconsistent. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being \"dropped\" down to the first 5s row. Looking at Example 0's input, the block of 5s starts at row 5. So the 2s in the rows above (rows 0-4) are transformed into 5s in the same column but in the row just above the 5s block. For instance, row 0's 2 at column 8 is now in row 4, column 8 as 5. Similarly, row 3's 2 at column 10 is in row 4, column 10. So maybe any number (like 2) in rows above the 5s block (which is rows 5-8 here) gets converted into 5s in the row immediately below their original position, but only if they are in the columns where the 5s are present? Or perhaps each non-zero number above the 5s block causes a 5 to be placed in the row below it, but accumulating?\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the rows with 2s are in rows 0, 2, 3, 9, 10, 12. The output has 5s in row 4 (columns 2, 8, 10) and row 9 (columns 1, 4, 9, 11). The 5s block is rows 5-8. So perhaps the 2s above the 5s block (rows 0-4) drop down to the row just before the 5s (row 4) in their respective columns, and those below the 5s block (rows 9-13) are lifted up to the row just after the 5s (row 9) in their columns. That might make sense. So any non-zero number in rows above the 5s block is moved down to the row right before the 5s start, same column. Any non-zero in rows below the 5s block are moved up to the row right after the 5s end. And the 5s themselves stay the same.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has 5s from column 4 onwards in each row. The non-zero numbers are 3s. The output has those 3s replaced with 5s in adjacent columns. For example, in the first row of input, there's a 3 at column 12. In the output, that column 12 is 0, but column 9 (which was 0 in input) becomes 5. Wait, maybe the 3s are being moved to the right into the 5s area. Let's see. The input rows have 5s starting at column 4. So if there's a 3 in column 3 (like row 2, column 3 is 3), the output in row 2, column 3 is 5. Wait, no. The output in row 2, column 3 is 5. So maybe any non-zero number (3 in this case) adjacent to the 5s area (columns 4 and beyond) is converted into a 5. So if a 3 is in column 3, which is adjacent to the 5s in column 4, then the output converts that 3 to a 5, extending the 5s into column 3. But looking at row 0 in Example 1's input, there's a 3 at column 12. The output in column 12 is 0, but column 9 becomes 5. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the 3s are being \"pushed\" into the 5s region. Like, any non-zero (3) in the non-5s area (columns 0-3 here) causes the 5s to expand into adjacent cells. Or perhaps it's about the position of the non-zero numbers relative to the 5s block. For example, in Example 1's input, all the 3s are in the rows where the 5s are present (since every row has 5s from column 4). The output seems to replace those 3s with 5s in some way. Wait, in Example 1's input, the 3s are in the rows that have 5s. Maybe when there's a non-zero (3) in a row that has 5s, the 3 is replaced with a 5, but also affects adjacent columns. For instance, in row 0, input column 8 is 5, and there's a 3 in column 12. Output row 0 has column 9 as 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2, the input has 1s in various positions. The output replaces those 1s with 5s in certain rows. For example, the input row 3 has 1s at columns 3,7,12. The output in row 6 has 5s at columns 3,7,8,12. Wait, maybe the 1s are \"falling\" down into the 5s area. The 5s are in rows 7 and 8. So any 1 above the 5s rows would fall down into the first row of 5s. For instance, the 1 in row 3, column 3 is in the input. In the output, row 6 (which is one row above the 5s rows) has a 5 in column 3. Hmm, maybe it's a different pattern here. Maybe the non-zero numbers (1s) are being converted into 5s in the row just above the 5s block. So in Example 2, the 5s start at row 7. So the 1s in rows above are converted to 5s in row 6. For example, input row 5 has a 1 at column 8. The output row 5 has a 5 at column 8. Wait, in the output of Example 2, row 5, column 8 is 0. Wait, no. Let me check again. The input row 5 (0-based index) has a 1 at column 8. The output row 6 has a 5 in column 8. So maybe it's moving down by one row. Or perhaps the 1s are being moved to the first row above the 5s block. Since the 5s start at row 7, then any 1s in rows above (rows 0-6) are converted to 5s in row 6. Similarly, 1s below the 5s block (rows 9-13) are moved to row 9. For example, input row 9 has a 1 at column 1. The output row 9 has a 5 there. So the pattern might be: for any non-zero number in a row above the 5s block, replace it with a 5 in the row just above the 5s. For rows below, replace with 5s in the row just below the 5s block. But the 5s block's position varies across examples. In Example 0, the 5s are rows 5-8. In Example 1, all rows have 5s from column 4. Wait, no. In Example 1, each row has 5s starting at column 4, but the 5s are in columns 4-8. So the 5s are vertical columns. So maybe the pattern is different depending on the structure of the 5s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the 5s form a solid block, and any non-zero numbers (like 2,3,1) in the input are \"projected\" into the 5s area. For example, in Example 0, the 2s are above and below the 5s block, and in the output, those 2s are converted into 5s in the same column but in the row adjacent to the 5s block. So the 2s above the 5s block (rows 0-4) have their column positions in the row just before the 5s (row 4) turned to 5. Similarly, 2s below the 5s block (rows 9-13) have their columns in the row just after the 5s (row 9) turned to 5. That seems to fit Example 0.\n\nIn Example 1, the 5s are in columns 4-8 for all rows. The non-zero numbers (3s) are in the same rows but in columns outside the 5s. The output converts those 3s into 5s in their own rows but within the 5s columns. Wait, in Example 1's input, row 0 has a 3 at column 12. The output row 0 has a 5 at column 9. So maybe the 3s are being moved to the left into the 5s columns? For instance, column 12 is outside the 5s (columns 4-8), so perhaps the 3s are shifted left into the first available position within the 5s block. Or maybe they're mirrored. Alternatively, the 3s in the input are replaced by 5s in the same row but adjacent to the 5s block. For example, in row 0 of Example 1, the 3 is at column 12, which is after the 5s (columns 4-8). The output has a 5 at column 9 (which is next to the 5s block). Maybe the 3s are converted to 5s in the nearest column adjacent to the 5s block. So if the 3 is to the right of the 5s, the 5 extends to column 9. If the 3 is to the left, maybe the 5s expand left. But in Example 1's input, some 3s are in column 3 (left side of the 5s), and the output has 5s in column 3. For example, input row 2 has a 3 in column 3, output row 2 has a 5 in column 3, which is adjacent to the 5s starting at column 4. So perhaps any non-zero in the input (like 3) adjacent to the 5s block (either left or right) causes the 5s to expand into that column. So the 3s are acting as markers to extend the 5s into adjacent columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero numbers (regardless of their value) in the input are replaced by 5s in the output, but only in certain positions relative to the 5s block. For example, in rows where the 5s are present, any non-zero in the same row is converted to 5. But in Example 1, the output converts some 3s into 5s even in the same row. Wait, but the 5s are already present in those rows. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the 5s are in rows 7 and 8. The non-zero numbers (1s) are in rows above and below. The output converts some of these 1s into 5s in rows 6 and 9. For instance, the input row 3 has a 1 at column 3. The output row 6 (which is one row above the 5s) has a 5 in column 3. Similarly, input row 9 has a 1 in column 1, which becomes a 5 in output row 9, column 1. Wait, row 9 is below the 5s block (rows 7-8), so maybe the 1s below are converted into 5s in their own row, but only if they are in columns adjacent to the 5s columns? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 1s are \"falling\" into the 5s area. For example, in row 5 of the input (Example 2), there's a 1 at column 8. The output row 5 has a 0 there, but row 6 (next row) has a 5 in column 8. So it's like the 1s are falling down until they hit the 5s block. But that would require checking all the cells below until they hit a 5. But that might be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that any non-zero number in the input (like 2,3,1) is replaced with a 5 in the output in the same column, but in the nearest row that is adjacent to the 5s block. For example, if the 5s are in rows 5-8 (Example 0), then non-zero numbers above would have their 5s in row 4, and those below in row 9. If the 5s are in columns 4-8 (Example 1), then non-zero numbers to the left would have their 5s in column 3, and to the right in column 9. But how does this apply to Example 2? Let's see. The 5s in Example 2 are in rows 7-8 (the two full rows). So non-zero numbers above (rows 0-6) would have their 5s in row 6, and those below (rows 9-13) in row 9. This seems to align with the output in Example 2.\n\nSo putting it all together, the pattern might be:\n\nFor each non-zero number in the input grid:\n\n- If the non-zero is located above a contiguous block of 5s (vertically), place a 5 in the same column but in the row immediately above the 5s block.\n\n- If the non-zero is located below the 5s block, place a 5 in the same column but in the row immediately below the 5s block.\n\n- If the non-zero is to the left or right of the 5s block (horizontally), place a 5 in the same row but in the column immediately adjacent to the 5s block.\n\nWait, but how to determine the direction (left/right/above/below) based on the position of the 5s block in each example.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s form a contiguous region, and the non-zero numbers are markers that expand the 5s into adjacent cells. But perhaps the rule is that each non-zero number in the input (regardless of value) causes the nearest cell in the direction towards the main 5s block to become a 5 in the output.\n\nBut how to determine the main 5s block? For example, in Example 0, the 5s are a solid block in rows 5-8, all columns. So any non-zero above would cause the 5 to be placed in row 4, same column. Non-zero below would be placed in row 9. In Example 1, the 5s are in columns 4-8 for all rows. So any non-zero in the same row but outside those columns would cause the 5 to extend into the adjacent column. For example, a non-zero to the left (column 3) would extend the 5s to column 3. A non-zero to the right (column 9) would extend to column 9. In Example 2, the 5s are in rows 7-8, so non-zeros above are placed in row 6, same column. Non-zeros below are placed in row 9.\n\nSo the general rule is:\n\n- Identify the main contiguous block of 5s in the input.\n\n- For each non-zero number in the input:\n\n   - If it's above the block, place a 5 in the same column in the row directly above the block.\n\n   - If it's below the block, place a 5 in the same column in the row directly below the block.\n\n   - If it's to the left or right of the block, place a 5 in the same row in the column adjacent to the block.\n\nBut how to determine the main block? For instance, in Example 1, the 5s are in columns 4-8 for all rows. So the main block is a vertical stripe. So non-zero numbers to the left (columns 0-3) would extend the 5s left into column 3. Non-zero to the right (columns 9-13) would extend into column 9.\n\nIn Example 0, the main block is a horizontal block (rows 5-8). Non-zeros above and below affect rows 4 and 9.\n\nIn Example 2, the main block is rows 7-8. Non-zeros above go to row 6, below to row 9.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Identify the main 5s block in the input. This is likely the largest contiguous region of 5s. For example, in Example 0, rows 5-8 are all 5s. In Example 1, columns 4-8 in all rows. In Example 2, rows 7-8.\n\n2. For each non-zero in the input:\n\n   a. If the non-zero is in a row above the main block's top row, place a 5 in the same column, top row - 1.\n\n   b. If the non-zero is in a row below the main block's bottom row, place a 5 in the same column, bottom row + 1.\n\n   c. If the non-zero is in a column to the left of the main block's leftmost column, place a 5 in the same row, leftmost column - 1.\n\n   d. If the non-zero is in a column to the right of the main block's rightmost column, place a 5 in the same row, rightmost column + 1.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the main block's columns are 4-8. So for a non-zero in column 3 (left), place a 5 in column 3 (same row). For a non-zero in column 9 (right), place in column 9. That matches Example 1's output where 3s in column 3 and 9 are replaced with 5s.\n\nIn Example 0, the main block is rows 5-8. So non-zeros above (rows 0-4) place in row 4, same column. Non-zeros below (rows 9-13) place in row 9. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2, main block is rows 7-8. Non-zeros above (rows 0-6) place in row 6. Below (rows 9-13) place in row 9. Which matches the output.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nThe test input is:\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nEach row has 5s at columns 5-6 (indices 5 and 6). Wait, let's check:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo columns 5 and 6 are 5s. The same for other rows. For example, row 1: [0,0,4,0,0,5,5,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo columns 5 and 6 are 5s. All other rows have 5s in columns 5 and 6. So the main block of 5s in the test input is columns 5 and 6, and spans all rows (since every row has 5s in columns 5-6). Wait, no. Wait, the 5s are present in columns 5 and 6 for all rows. So the main block is a vertical stripe in columns 5 and 6 across all rows.\n\nSo the main block is columns 5-6, all rows. Therefore, any non-zero in the input that is outside columns 5-6 (left or right) would cause the 5s to expand into adjacent columns (columns 4 or 7). Non-zeros in other columns would affect their row's left or right adjacent to the 5s columns.\n\nLooking at the test input's non-zero entries. Let's list them:\n\nRow 0: all zeros except columns 5-6 (5s).\n\nRow 1: columns 2 (4), 9 (4).\n\nRow 3: column 3 (4).\n\nRow 4: column 1 (4).\n\nRow 6: column 7 (4), 11 (4).\n\nRow 11: columns 1 (4), 3 (4), 10 (4).\n\nRow 13: column 13 (4) \u2192 wait, no, row 13 is [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]. So column 12 (index 12) is 4.\n\nSo all non-zeros are 4s in columns outside 5-6. So columns to the left (columns 1,2,3,4) and right (7,9,10,11,12) of the 5s columns (5-6).\n\nSo according to the pattern, each non-zero (4) in a column left of 5 (i.e., columns 0-4) should result in a 5 in the same row, column 4 (since the main block starts at column 5). For non-zeros in columns right of 6 (columns 7-13), they should result in 5s in column 7 (the next column after 6).\n\nBut wait, the main block is columns 5-6, so leftmost column is 5. So non-zeros to the left (columns 0-4) would cause a 5 to be placed in column 4 (leftmost-1). Non-zeros to the right (columns 7-13) would cause 5 in column 7 (rightmost+1).\n\nSo let's look at each non-zero:\n\nRow 1, column 2 (4): left side. So output column 4 (5) in row 1.\n\nRow 1, column 9 (4): right side. So output column 7 in row 1.\n\nRow 3, column 3 (4): left. Output column 4 in row 3.\n\nRow 4, column 1 (4): left. Output column 4 in row 4.\n\nRow 6, column 7 (4): right. Output column 7 in row 6.\n\nRow 6, column 11 (4): right. Output column 7 in row 6.\n\nRow 11, column 1 (4): left. Output column 4 in row 11.\n\nRow 11, column 3 (4): left. Output column 4 in row 11.\n\nRow 11, column 10 (4): right. Output column 7 in row 11.\n\nRow 13, column 12 (4): right. Output column 7 in row 13.\n\nBut wait, the rightmost column of the 5s block is 6. So rightmost+1 is 7. So any non-zero in columns >=7 should be converted to 5s in column 7 of the same row.\n\nSimilarly, any non-zero in columns <=4 (since 5 is the leftmost) would convert to column 4.\n\nSo, for each non-zero in the test input:\n\nRow 1, column 2 (left) \u2192 row 1, column 4 becomes 5.\n\nRow 1, column 9 (right) \u2192 row 1, column 7 becomes 5.\n\nRow 3, column 3 (left) \u2192 row 3, column 4 becomes 5.\n\nRow 4, column 1 (left) \u2192 row 4, column 4 becomes 5.\n\nRow 6, column 7 (right) \u2192 row 6, column 7 becomes 5.\n\nRow 6, column 11 (right) \u2192 row 6, column 7 becomes 5.\n\nRow 11, column 1 (left) \u2192 row 11, column 4 becomes 5.\n\nRow 11, column 3 (left) \u2192 row 11, column 4 becomes 5.\n\nRow 11, column 10 (right) \u2192 row 11, column 7 becomes 5.\n\nRow 13, column 12 (right) \u2192 row 13, column 7 becomes 5.\n\nSo in the output, these columns would have 5s added.\n\nNow, the original 5s in columns 5-6 remain. All other positions are 0 unless modified by the above.\n\nLet's check if this matches the expected pattern.\n\nFor example, in row 1 of the test input's output, columns 4 and 7 should have 5s. The input row 1 has non-zeros at columns 2 and 9. So output row 1 would be:\n\n[0,0,4,0,0,5,5,5,0,4,0,0,0,0] \u2192 but according to the pattern, the 4s are replaced by 5s in columns 4 and 7. Wait, no. The 4s are the non-zero inputs. So the output should have 5s at column 4 (from left side) and column 7 (from right side), but the original 4s would become 0. So output row 1 would be:\n\nOriginal row 1: [0,0,4,0,0,5,5,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nAfter transformation: replace 4s with 5s at columns 4 and 7. So:\n\n[0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but wait. The non-zero in column 2 (left) \u2192 column 4. So column 4 becomes 5. The non-zero in column 9 (right) \u2192 column 7 becomes 5. So the row becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut the original 5s are in columns 5 and 6. So columns 5-6 remain 5s. Columns 4 and 7 are added 5s.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 has non-zeros at column 7 (right) and 11 (right). Both of these would trigger adding 5s at column 7. So row 6's output would have 5s in columns 5,6,7. So:\n\nOriginal row 6: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,4,0,0,0,4,0,0]\n\nAfter transformation: non-zero at 7 and 11 (both right side) \u2192 column 7 becomes 5. So row 6 becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but there's a 4 in column 7 and 11. Both are to the right of column 6. So each of them would contribute to column 7. So column 7 would be 5. The 4s become 0. So the output row 6 would have 5s in columns 5,6,7.\n\nSimilarly, row 11 has non-zeros at columns 1 (left), 3 (left), and 10 (right). So each left non-zero would add 5 at column 4, and the right non-zero adds 5 at column 7. So row 11's output:\n\nOriginal: [0,4,0,4,0,5,5,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]\n\nAfter transformation: non-zeros at columns 1 and 3 (left) \u2192 column 4. Non-zero at column 10 (right) \u2192 column 7. So:\n\n[0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut the existing 5s are in columns 5-6, so columns 4,5,6,7 would be 5s.\n\nPutting it all together, the output should have the original 5s in columns 5-6, plus additional 5s in column 4 for left non-zeros and column 7 for right non-zeros, in the same rows where the non-zeros were present.\n\nSo the final output for the test input would be:\n\nEach row with a non-zero in the test input would have 5s added in columns 4 and/or 7, depending on whether the non-zero was to the left or right.\n\nNow, let's construct each row of the output.\n\nRow 0: No non-zeros (only 5s in 5-6). So remains [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: non-zeros at 2 and 9. Left 2 \u2192 column 4. Right 9 \u2192 column 7. So row becomes [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: No non-zeros. So same as input: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: non-zero at column 3 (left) \u2192 column 4. So row becomes [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: non-zero at column 1 (left) \u2192 column 4. So row becomes [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: No non-zeros. So same: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: non-zeros at columns 7 and 11 (both right) \u2192 column 7. So row becomes [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: No non-zeros. Same: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: Same: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 9: Same: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 10: Same: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 11: non-zeros at columns 1,3,10. Columns 1 and 3 (left) \u2192 column 4. Column 10 (right) \u2192 column 7. So row becomes [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 12: No non-zeros. Same: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 13: non-zero at column 12 (right) \u2192 column 7. So row becomes [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,4,0] \u2192 Wait, no. The non-zero is column 12 (right of 6), so column 7 becomes 5. The original 4 becomes 0. So row 13: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, the original row 13 input has a 4 at column 12. So according to the pattern, this should turn into a 5 at column 7. So column 7 becomes 5, and the rest (columns 12) becomes 0.\n\nSo putting all together, the output should look like this (each row):\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 10: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 11: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 12: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 13: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis seems to be the expected output based on the pattern observed in the training examples.",
