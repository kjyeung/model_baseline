        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input lists are transformed into the output lists. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, there are four lists. The first list has elements [0,3,0,...], and in the output, the first list becomes [0,0,0,...] with an 8 and a 3. Wait, maybe there's a shift happening here. Let me look closer.\n\nLooking at the first input row of Example 0:\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nAnd the output row:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHmm. The original 3 is at position 1. In the output, there's an 8 at position 5 and a 3 at position 7. The 2 remains in position 10. Maybe the 3s are being moved to a different position, and the 8 is inserted. Also, the length of the list is 16 in both input and output. So maybe the elements are being shifted to the right? Let's check the other rows.\n\nIn the second input row of Example 0:\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere, the 3s (positions 1-3) in the input become at positions 7-9 in the output, and there's an 8 at position 5. The 2 is still at position 10. So maybe the 3s are shifted to the right by 6 positions? Let's see: original index 1 (3) would move to 1 +6=7. That matches. And the 8 is placed at index 5. Also, the 2 remains where it was. \n\nWait, but in the first example's input, the 3s are in different positions but the output always has the 8 at position 5, and the 3s shifted right. Also, the 2 is at position 10. So perhaps the rule is: move all the 3s some number of positions to the right, insert an 8 at a certain position, and leave the 2s in place. Let me check if the 2 is always in the same position. In Example 0's input, the 2 is at position 10 in all input rows, and in the output, it's still at 10. So 2 stays. \n\nIn Example 1, the input has a row with [2,2,2,2,2] at the bottom (position 15 in the list). In the output, that row remains in position 15, but the other rows (with 3s) are moved. The output has an 8 inserted in row 10 (0-based index 10?), and the 3s are moved below the 8. Wait, in Example 1's output, the 8s are in a row (index 10?), and the 3s from the input are moved to positions 11-14. So maybe the 3s are shifted down in the list, and the 8s are inserted above them. So perhaps the pattern is that all the 3s are shifted to a new position, and 8 is inserted in a specific place relative to the 2s or the 3s.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has a 2 in row 3, then some 3s in rows 11-13. The output moves those 3s to rows 4-6, inserts 8s in row 7, and leaves the 2 in row 3. So again, the 3s are shifted up, and 8 is inserted after them. Wait, but in Example 0, the 3s were shifted to the right, but in Example 1 and 2, they might be shifted in the vertical direction (i.e., rows).\n\nWait, maybe each list in the input is a row of a grid, and the transformation involves moving blocks of 3s in some way, inserting 8s, and keeping the 2s fixed. Let's think of each input as a grid where each list is a row. Then, the output grid is created by moving the 3-blocks (contiguous 3s) to a new position, inserting an 8 in a certain row, and leaving the 2s in their original rows.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input rows have 3s and a 2 in some positions. The output rows have the 3s shifted to the right, and an 8 inserted in position 5 (maybe the fifth row?), but wait, each list is a row. Wait, no, in Example 0, all the input rows are part of the same input. Wait, actually, looking at the input format: for Example 0, the INPUT is four separate lists. Then the output is four separate lists. So each list in the input corresponds to a list in the output. So the transformation is per list, not across lists.\n\nWait, but Example 0's input is four lists, each of length 16. The output is also four lists, each of length 16. So perhaps each input list is transformed individually. Let's check the first input list of Example 0:\n\nInput: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,3,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nIn the input, the non-zero elements are 3 at index 1 and 2 at index 10. In the output, the 3 is moved to index 7, and an 8 is placed at index 5. The 2 remains at index 10. So maybe in each list, the 3s are shifted to the right by 6 positions (1+6=7), and the 8 is inserted at index 5. But how does that apply to other lists?\n\nLooking at the second input list of Example 0:\n[0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,3,3,3,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nHere, the 3s are at indices 1,2,3. In output, they are at 7,8,9. So shifted by 6 positions. The 8 is at index 5. So again, the same shift. So per list, 3s are moved to the right by 6 positions, 8 inserted at index 5, and 2 remains.\n\nWait, but why 6 positions? Let's check the distance between original position and new. For the first list: 3 was at 1, moved to 7. 7-1=6. So shift right by 6. Similarly, in the second input list, 1,2,3 shifted to 7,8,9: same shift. But in the third input list of Example 0:\n\nInput: [3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput: [0,0,0,0,0,8,3,3,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOriginal 3s are at 0 and 1. In the output, they are at 6 and 7. 6-0=6, 7-1=6. So again, shifted right by 6. The 8 is at index 5. So the 8 is inserted before the shifted 3s. So the pattern seems to be: for each list in the input, take all the 3s and shift them right by 6 positions. Insert an 8 at position 5. The 2s remain in their original position.\n\nBut wait, in the third input list of Example 0, the 3s start at index 0 and 1. After shifting by 6, they would be at 6 and 7, which matches the output. And the 8 is at index 5. So yes. So the steps are:\n\n1. For each element in the input list:\n   a. If the element is 3, shift it 6 positions to the right.\n   b. If the element is 2, leave it in place.\n2. Insert an 8 at position 5.\n\nBut wait, inserting an 8 might overwrite existing elements. For example, in the first input list, after shifting the 3 to position 7, inserting an 8 at position 5 (which was 0 in the input). So the 8 is added at position 5. But in the output, the 8 is there. So perhaps, the process is:\n\n- Move all 3s to the right by 6 positions.\n- Place an 8 at position 5.\n- 2 remains in place.\n\nBut in the first example's input, the 3 is at position 1. Moving right by 6, it would be position 7. The 8 is placed at position 5. So in the output, the 8 is at 5 and the 3 is at 7. The 2 is at 10. So that's correct.\n\nNow check Example 1. Let's take a single list. For example, the second input list is [3,3,0,0,0]. The output for that list in the output is [0,0,0,0,0], but in the OUTPUT of Example 1, the 3s are moved to lower rows. Wait, maybe the transformation here is not per list but per entire grid. Wait, Example 1's input has 17 lists (rows) of length 5 each. The output has 17 rows. In the input, the 3s are in rows 1,2,3,4. The 2s are in row 15. The output's 8s are in row 10, and the 3s are moved to rows 11-14. So perhaps the transformation is to take all the 3s in the input grid and move them down by a certain number of rows, inserting 8s in a specific row. The 2s remain in their original row.\n\nSo for Example 1, the 3s are originally in rows 1,2,3,4. In the output, they are in rows 11-14. The 8s are inserted in row 10. The 2s are in row 15. So the 3s are moved down by 10 rows (from row 1 to row 11: 10 rows down). Then insert 8s in row 10. So the pattern here is different from Example 0. Hmm, this complicates things. Because in Example 0, the shift was horizontal (within each list), but in Example 1, it's vertical (moving rows down). So maybe the pattern depends on the position of the 2 in the list.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 2 is at position 10 (index 10) in the list. The 3s are shifted to the right by 6 positions. So if the 2 is in position X, then the 3s are shifted to the right by (X - 5), but 10-5=5, but in Example 0, the shift was 6. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 8 is placed at position 5 in the list, and the 3s are shifted to positions after that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is the position of the 2 in each row. Let's look at Example 0's input: each list has a 2 at position 10. The 8 is inserted at position 5. The 3s are shifted right by 6. So 5 is the position where the 8 is inserted, and 10 is the 2's position. Maybe the 3s are shifted so that they are between the 8 and the 2. Let's see: 8 is at 5, 3s are at 7,8,9, and 2 is at 10. So between 5 and 10. The distance between 5 and 10 is 5, but the 3s are shifted by 6 positions. Not sure.\n\nIn Example 1, the 2 is in row 15 (the 16th row). The 8s are inserted in row 10 (11th row). The 3s are moved to rows 11-14 (which are between 8 and 2's row). So perhaps the pattern is: insert 8s in a row that is 5 rows above the 2's row. Then move the 3s to the rows just below the 8s, pushing the existing content down.\n\nIn Example 2's input, the 2 is in row 3. The 8s are inserted in row 7. The 3s are moved to rows 4-6 (rows after the 2's row, but in the output, the 8s are in row 7. Wait, perhaps not. Let me check.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the 2 is in row 3 (the fourth row) of the input. The 3s are in rows 11,12,13 (input's 12th to 14th rows). The output has the 3s moved to rows 4,5,6 (the fifth to seventh rows) and the 8s are in row 7 (eighth row). So the 8s are inserted below the moved 3s, and the 2 remains in row 3. So maybe the 8 is placed a certain distance after the 3s are moved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that all 3s are moved to a position such that they are placed after the 2's row, and the 8 is inserted in the row immediately following the 3s. But in Example 1, the 2 is in row 15. The 3s are moved to rows 11-14, and the 8 is in row 10. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the 8 is inserted at a fixed distance from the 2.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 2 is at position 10 in the list. The 8 is at position 5. So 10 -5 =5. So maybe the 8 is placed 5 positions before the 2 in the same row. Wait, but in Example 1, the 2 is in row 15. The 8 is in row 10. So again, 15 -10=5. So the 8 is placed 5 rows above the 2's row. Then, all the 3s are moved to the rows between the 8 and the 2. So in Example 0, the 2 is in position 10 (same row), so perhaps the 8 is placed 5 positions before the 2 in the same list. Then the 3s are shifted to positions between the 8 and the 2.\n\nBut how does that apply to the vertical movement in Example 1 and 2? Maybe there's a confusion between horizontal and vertical transformations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that in each list (horizontal array), any 3s are shifted right by (distance from 2's position - some number), and the 8 is inserted. But how to reconcile with the vertical movement in Examples 1 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire grid is considered, and the 3s are moved towards the 2's position, with the 8 acting as a separator.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all the 3s in the entire input are moved to be just before the 2's location, and an 8 is inserted before them. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the 2's position in the grid determines where the 3s are moved and where the 8 is inserted. For example, in Example 0, each list has a 2 at index 10. So for each row in the input, if there's a 2 at index 10, then the 3s in that row are shifted to the right to positions 7-9 (so inserting them between position 5 (where the 8 is) and the 2 at 10.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the 8 is at position 5, then the 3s are at 7-9, then the 2 at 10. So between the 8 and the 2, there are the 3s. So perhaps for each row that contains a 2, the 3s are moved to between the 8 and the 2. And the 8 is placed 5 positions before the 2. So for Example 0, 2 is at position 10. 10-5=5. So insert 8 at 5, then 3s between 5 and 10.\n\nBut how does this apply to vertical examples like Example 1 and 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of horizontal and vertical transformations. Let's look at Example 1's input and output.\n\nIn Example 1's input, there's a row with 2s at the bottom (row 15). In the output, the 8s are in row 10, then the 3s are in rows 11-14, then the 2s in row 15. So the 8 is inserted 5 rows above the 2's row (15-5=10). Then the 3s are placed in the rows between the 8 and the 2. So for vertical movement, the 3s are moved to the rows between the 8 and the 2's row.\n\nIn Example 2's input, the 2 is in row 3 (the fourth row). The 8 is inserted in row 7 (the eighth row). The 3s are moved to rows 4-6 (rows 5-7 in the output). So here, the 8 is inserted 4 rows below the 2's row (3 +4=7). But in Example 1, it was 5 rows above, and here it's 4 rows below. This inconsistency complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is placed in the middle between the 3s and the 2. For Example 0, the 3s are moved to between 8 and 2. In Example 1, the 3s are moved below the 8 but above the 2. In Example 2, the 3s are placed above the 8, but the 2 is above all. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that all the 3s are moved to the position immediately before the 2's row or position, and the 8 is inserted before the 3s. Or maybe it's more about concatenating the 3s, then the 8, then the 2s, but that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to find a consistent rule across all examples.\n\nLooking at all examples:\n\n- In each example, there's a 2 or multiple 2s in certain positions.\n- The output inserts an 8 in a specific position, and the 3s are moved to new positions.\n- The 2s remain in their original positions.\n\nExample 0: Each input list has a 2 at position 10. The output for each list has an 8 at position 5, and the 3s shifted to positions 7-9 (or similar).\n\nExample 1: The 2s are in row 15. The output inserts 8s in row 10, and moves the 3s to rows 11-14.\n\nExample 2: The 2s are in row 3. The output inserts 8s in row 7, and moves the 3s to rows 4-6.\n\nHmm, the distance between the 8's row and the 2's row varies. In Example 1, 15-10=5. Example 2, 7-3=4. Not a consistent difference. But wait, perhaps the 8 is placed in the middle between the original position of the 3s and the 2's position.\n\nIn Example 0, the original 3s were in positions 1-3 (first list), and the 2 is at position 10. The 8 is at 5. The 3s are moved to 7-9. So the distance from original 3s to 8 is 5-1=4. Then from 8 to 2 is 10-5=5. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 8 is placed at a fixed offset from the 2's position. In Example 0, the 2 is at index 10, and the 8 is at index 5 (10-5=5). In Example 1, the 2 is in row 15, the 8 is in row 10 (15-10=5). Example 2, the 2 is in row 3, and the 8 is in row 7 (7-3=4). So this doesn't fit. So that's inconsistent.\n\nBut wait, maybe in Example 2, the input's 3s are in rows 11-13 (0-based?), and the output's 3s are in rows 4-6. So the 3s are moved up by 7 rows. The 8 is inserted in row 7. So the 3s are placed above the 8. But the 2 is in row 3. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 8 is placed between the original positions of the 3s and the 2. For example, in Example 0, the 3s were in the first few positions, and the 2 is at position 10. The 8 is placed halfway between, at position 5. The 3s are moved to after the 8 but before the 2. So the 3s are shifted to the right of the 8 and left of the 2.\n\nIn Example 1, the 3s are in the top rows (rows 1-4), and the 2 is in row 15. The 8 is placed in row 10, and the 3s are moved to rows 11-14, which are between the 8 and the 2. So the 8 is placed before the 3s, and the 3s are between the 8 and the 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3s are in rows 11-13 of the input, and the 2 is in row 3. The 8 is in row 7 of the output. The 3s are moved to rows 4-6, which are between the 2's row (3) and the 8's row (7). So the 3s are moved to between the 2 and the 8, and the 8 is placed after them. That seems inconsistent with the other examples.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLooking for another pattern: The output has all the 3s from the input arranged in a certain way relative to the 8 and the 2. The 2 stays where it is. The 8 is inserted in a specific position. Maybe the rule is:\n\n- For each row that contains a 2, insert an 8 in a specific position in that row, and shift the 3s to positions after the 8 but before the 2.\n\nBut this is for horizontal shifts. For vertical shifts (like in Example 1 and 2), it's about the entire grid. Perhaps the 8 is inserted in the row that is 5 rows above the row containing the 2, and the 3s are moved to the rows between the 8 and the 2.\n\nBut in Example 0, the 2 is in each row's position 10. So for each row, the 8 is inserted 5 positions before the 2's position (10-5=5), and the 3s are shifted to after the 8 but before the 2.\n\nIn Example 1, the 2 is in row 15. The 8 is inserted 5 rows above (row 10), and the 3s are moved to rows 11-14 between the 8 and the 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2 is in row 3. But the 8 is inserted in row 7, which is 4 rows below. This breaks the pattern. So perhaps this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the number of positions between the 8 and the 2 is equal to the number of 3s. Let's check:\n\nExample 0: For the first list, there's one 3. The 8 is at 5, 2 at 10. Distance is 5 positions. Number of 3s is 1. Not matching.\n\nExample 1: The 3s are in 4 rows. The distance between 8 (row 10) and 2 (row 15) is 5 rows. The number of 3 rows is 4. Not exactly matching.\n\nExample 2: The 3s are in 3 rows. The distance between 8 (row7) and 2 (row3) is 4 rows. Not matching.\n\nThis approach doesn't seem to work.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the 8 is inserted at a position that is the sum of the positions of the 3s and the 2s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 8 is inserted at the midpoint between the 3s and the 2. For Example 0, the 3s are at position 1, and the 2 is at 10. The midpoint is (1+10)/2 =5.5, so rounded to 5. The 8 is inserted at position 5, which matches. Then the 3s are moved to positions after the 8. So perhaps the rule is: find the midpoint between the leftmost 3 and the 2, insert an 8 there, and shift the 3s to the right of the 8.\n\nIn Example 0's first input list: 3 is at 1, 2 at 10. Midpoint is 5.5, so position 5. Insert 8, then move the 3 to 7 (so shifted right by 2, but earlier we thought it was shifted by 6). Wait, this may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s are moved to start at the position after the 8. So in Example 0, 8 is at 5, then the 3s start at 7. So two positions after. But why 2 positions?\n\nAlternatively, after inserting the 8, the 3s are placed in the same order after the 8, but with some spacing.\n\nThis is getting stuck. Maybe I need to look for another pattern.\n\nLet me look at all the outputs and see what's common:\n\n- The 8 is always in a single contiguous block.\n- The 3s are grouped together, either in a block or spread out.\n- The 2s remain in their original positions.\n\nAnother idea: the 8 could represent the sum of the 3s and the 2. For example, 3+3+2=8. But in Example 0, there's one 3 and one 2, which sum to 5. Not 8. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, 3+5=8. Maybe the 8 is formed by some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, the 8 is inserted in a position that is the sum of the count of 3s and the position of the 2. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first list: count of 3s is 1, 2's position is 10. 1+10=11. Not relevant to 8's position 5.\n\nExample 1: count of 3s in the input is 4 (rows 1-4). 4+15=19. Output's 8 is in row 10. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the movement of the 3s. In Example 0, each row's 3s are shifted right by 6 positions, and an 8 is inserted at position 5.\n\nIn Example 1, the 3s are shifted down by 10 rows (from row 1 to 11), and an 8 is inserted at row 10.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3s are shifted up by 7 rows (from rows 11-13 to 4-6), and the 8 is inserted at row 7.\n\nThis seems arbitrary. But maybe there's a relationship between the 2's position and the shift.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 is at position 10. Shift for 3s is 6 positions. 10-5=5. 5+1=6? Not sure.\n\nExample 1: 2's row is 15. Shift is 10 rows down. 15-5=10. So maybe shift is (2's row or position) -5.\n\nIn Example 0's first list: 2's position is 10. 10-5=5. But the shift was 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: The sum of the positions of the 3s and the 2 equals the position of the 8.\n\nExample 0, first list: 3 at 1, 2 at 10. 1+10=11. 8 is at 5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the average. (1+10)/2=5.5. 8 is at 5. Close but not exact.\n\nExample 1: 3s in rows 1-4. 2 in row15. Average (1+2+3+4+15)/5= (10+15)/5=25/5=5. 8 is in row10. Not matching.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nLet's try to think of the 8 as a separator between the 3s and the 2. In Example 0, the 8 is between the 3s and the 2. In Example 1, the 8 is between the 3s and the 2. In Example 2, the 8 is below the 3s but the 2 is above. Wait, no, in Example 2, the 2 is in row3, then the 3s are in rows4-6, then the 8 in row7. So the 8 is below the 3s and the 2 is above. So the 8 is not a separator between them. This complicates things.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the test input and see if we can find a pattern based on the examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nEach list is of length 18. The 2 is at position 4 in each list. The 3s are at positions 12 and 13 in the first list, 11 and 13 in the second, 11-13 in the third, and 11 in the fourth.\n\nFollowing the pattern from Example 0, where the 3s are shifted right by 6 positions and an 8 is inserted at position 5 (since the 2 is at position 10 in Example 0's lists), let's see:\n\nIn the test input lists, the 2 is at position4. If we apply the same logic: shift the 3s right by (5) positions (since in Example 0, 10-5=5, so the shift is 6 positions. Wait, maybe the shift is (position of 8 - original position of 3). \n\nIn the test input, the 2 is at position4. If the 8 is inserted at position4-5= -1, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the shift is based on the position of the 2. In Example 0, the 2 is at 10, 8 at5. So 10-5=5. The 3s are shifted by 6 positions (from 1 to 7: 7-1=6). So maybe shift is (2's position - 8's position) +1? 10-5=5, 5+1=6. That works. So in Example 0, shift is 6 positions to the right.\n\nIn Example 1, the 2 is in row15. The 8 is in row10. 15-10=5. The shift would be 5+1=6 rows down. So 3s in row1 would move to row1+6=7. But in Example1's output, the 3s are in rows11-14. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 8's position minus original position. In Example0, 8 is at5, original 3 is at1. 5-1=4. But the 3 is shifted to7, which is 6 positions away. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the test input. Each list has a 2 at position4. The 3s are at varying positions. Let's assume that in the output, the 8 is inserted at position4-5= -1, which is impossible, so maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8 is inserted 5 positions before the 2 in the same list. For the test input lists, the 2 is at position4. 5 positions before would be position-1, which is invalid. So this can't be. So the pattern must be different for vertical and horizontal shifts.\n\nPerhaps in the test input, since the 2 is at position4 in each list, the 8 is inserted at position4-5= -1, which doesn't work, so maybe the pattern is that the 8 is inserted in a new row below the 2's row. But since the test input has four lists (rows), perhaps the output will have more rows.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input's structure:\n\nEach list has a 2 at position4. The 3s are in positions 11-13 in the first list, 11 and 13 in the second, etc. Following Example0's pattern, perhaps in each list, the 3s are shifted to the right by a certain number of positions and an 8 is inserted.\n\nBut the test input's lists have length 18. Let's see:\n\nFor the first test input list: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe 2 is at index4. The 3s are at 12 and13.\n\nIf the pattern is to shift the 3s to the right by (index of 2 + 1) =5 positions. So 12+5=17, but the list length is 18. So positions 17 and 18 (which is beyond the list). That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, shift the 3s by (index of 2 - index of 3). For example, in the first list of Example0: 3 is at1, 2 at10. 10-1=9. But the shift was6. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is to move the 3s to positions after the 8. For the test input, the 8 must be inserted somewhere. Maybe the 8 is inserted at position (index of 2 -5) but since the 2 is at4, 4-5= -1, which is invalid. So perhaps the pattern is different when the 2 is at a lower index.\n\nWait, maybe the shift is calculated differently. In Example0, the 3s are shifted by 6 positions to the right. The 8 is inserted at position5. The 2 is at position10. So between 5 and10 there are 5 positions. The 3s are placed starting at position7. So perhaps the 3s are placed in the middle third between the 8 and the 2.\n\nAlternatively, for each list, the 3s are moved to between the 8 and the 2. So in the test input's lists, we need to insert the 8 somewhere, then place the 3s between the 8 and the 2.\n\nBut since the 2 is at position4, which is early in the list, there's not much space to the left. So maybe the 8 is inserted to the right of the 2.\n\nWait, this is getting too speculative. Let's try to look for the most plausible pattern.\n\nIn Example0, the 3s are shifted to the right by6 positions. The 8 is inserted at position5. So in the output, the 3s are after the 8. The 2 is at position10. So the order is 8, then 3s, then 2.\n\nIn Example1, the 8 is inserted in row10, then the 3s are in rows11-14, then the 2 in row15. So the order is 8, 3s, 2.\n\nIn Example2, the 2 is in row3, then the 3s are in rows4-6, then the 8 in row7. So the order is 2, 3s, 8. Which is different from the other examples.\n\nThis inconsistency makes it hard to find a pattern. Perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that in each case, the 3s are moved to a new position, the 8 is inserted, and the 2 remains. For the test input, we need to replicate this.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nEach list has 2 at position4. The 3s are at various positions to the right.\n\nIf the pattern is similar to Example0, shifting the 3s to the right by a certain amount and inserting an 8.\n\nBut since the 2 is at position4, perhaps the 8 is inserted to the right of the 2. For example, inserting 8 at position5, then shifting the 3s to the right by a certain amount.\n\nFor example, in the first test input list:\n\nOriginal 3s are at12 and13. If we insert 8 at position5, then shift the 3s to the right by, say, 6 positions. 12+6=18 (list length is18, so index17). But that would be beyond the list. So maybe the shift is different.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s are moved to positions after the 8. For example, inserting the 8 at position5, then placing the 3s starting from position6. But in the first test list, the 3s are at12 and13. If we move them to positions6 and7, but that would overwrite other zeros. Let's see:\n\nOriginal list: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nInsert 8 at position5. The list becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nThen shift the 3s from 12 and13 to positions after the 8. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the 3s are shifted to positions after the 8 but before the 2. But the 2 is at position4, which is before the 8. That doesn't make sense.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should try to find the pattern based on the examples and apply it to the test input.\n\nBased on Examples 0-2, the general pattern seems to be:\n\n- All 3s in the input are moved to a new position, which is a certain distance away (either horizontally or vertically) from their original position.\n- An 8 is inserted in a specific position.\n- The 2s remain in their original positions.\n\nFor the test input, each list has a 2 at position4 and 3s at higher positions. In Example0, the 3s were to the left of the 2 and were shifted to the right. In the test input's case, the 3s are to the right of the 2. So perhaps the pattern is to move the 3s to the left, towards the 2, and insert the 8 between the 3s and the 2.\n\nFor example, in the first test list:\n\nOriginal positions of 3s are12 and13. The 2 is at4. To insert 8 between them, we might shift the 3s to the left by 7 positions (12-7=5, 13-7=6), but then they would be at5 and6, which is after the 2 (which is at4). So inserting the 8 at position5:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,8,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut then the 2 is at4, 8 at5, 3s at6-7. This would match the pattern of 2 followed by 8 and then 3s. But in Example0, the order was 8, then 3s, then 2. So this is reversed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are moved to the left to be just before the 2, and the 8 is inserted after the 3s. But that would make the order 3s, 8, 2. For example:\n\nTest input first list:\n\nOriginal 3s at12 and13. Shift left by 8 positions to 4 and5. Insert 8 at5. Then the 3s would be at4 and5, but the 2 is also at4. Conflict. So this doesn't work.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at how many positions the 3s are moved in each example.\n\nExample0:\n\nFor the first list, 3 is at1. Shifted to7: difference6.\n\nSecond list, 3s at1-3 shifted to7-9: difference6.\n\nThird list, 3s at0-1 shifted to6-7: difference6.\n\nExample1:\n\nThe 3s are moved from rows1-4 to rows11-14: difference10 rows.\n\nExample2:\n\nThe 3s are moved from rows11-13 to rows4-6: difference-7 rows.\n\nThis suggests that the shift varies based on the position of the 2. So in Example0, where the 2 is at position10, the shift is +6. In Example1, where the 2 is at row15, the shift is+10. In Example2, where the 2 is at row3, the shift is-7. So the shift amount depends on the position of the 2.\n\nBut how?\n\nExample0: 2's position10, shift +6. 10-4=6. Not sure.\n\nExample1: 2's row15, shift+10. 15-5=10.\n\nExample2: 2's row3, shift-7. 3-10= -7.\n\nHmm, this could be a pattern. The shift amount is (2's position - 5). For Example0: 10-5=5. But the shift was6. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, shift is (2's position - 8's position). In Example0, 10-5=5. But the shift was6. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very challenging. Perhaps the correct approach is to move the 3s to a position such that the 8 is placed between the 3s and the 2, and the 3s are moved as a group.\n\nIn the test input, the 2 is at position4. The 3s are at positions11-13 (first list). To insert an 8 between the 2 and the 3s, the 8 would be at position5, and the 3s would be moved to positions6-8. But this requires shifting the 3s left by5 positions (from12-13 to6-7). Then inserting the 8 at5.\n\nSo the first test list would become:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,8,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut this leaves the 2 at4, 8 at5, 3s at6-7.\n\nBut in the output examples, when the 3s are moved, they replace the zeros in the new positions. So this could be possible.\n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples? For Example0, shifting the 3s right by6 positions and inserting the 8 at5 creates the pattern. So perhaps the rule is:\n\n- For each list, the 3s are moved to positions starting at (2's position -5), and the 8 is inserted at (2's position -5 -1).\n\nWait, for Example0, 2's position is10. 10-5=5. So the 3s are moved to start at5, but in the output, they start at7. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 8 is placed at (2's position -5), and the 3s are moved to start at (8's position +2). For Example0, 10-5=5. 8 at5. 5+2=7. Which matches the shifted 3s starting at7.\n\nFor the test input, 2's position is4. 4-5= -1. Which is invalid, so this approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, the 8 is placed at (2's position +1), and the 3s are moved to after the 8. For Example0, 10+1=11. But the 8 is at5. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tough. Perhaps I should look for a pattern in the output's 8 and 3 positions relative to the 2.\n\nIn Example0, the output's 8 is at position5, and the 3s are at7-9. The 2 is at10. So 8 is5, 3s start at7, which is5+2. Then 2 is at10. So between 8 and 2, there are two zeros. But the 3s fill positions7-9.\n\nIn Example1, the 8 is at row10, 3s are in rows11-14, and 2 is in row15. So 8 is row10, then 3s start at11, and 2 is at15. So the 3s are directly after the 8.\n\nIn Example2, the 8 is at row7, 3s are in rows4-6, and 2 is in row3. So the 3s are before the 8, and the 2 is before the 3s. So this is a different arrangement.\n\nSo there's no consistent pattern between the examples.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll make an educated guess based on the test input.\n\nThe test input has four lists. Each list has a 2 at position4 and 3s in positions11-13 or similar. The output should likely insert an 8 in a position related to the 2 and shift the 3s.\n\nLooking at the training examples, when the 2 is in a row, the 3s are moved to a new position and an 8 is inserted. For vertical shifts (like Example1), the 3s are moved down below the 8. For horizontal shifts (Example0), moved to the right. In Example2, perhaps the 3s are moved up.\n\nFor the test input, since the 3s are to the right of the 2, perhaps they are shifted left to be near the 2, and an 8 is inserted between the 2 and the 3s. For example:\n\nOriginal test input first list:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nShift the 3s left by 8 positions to positions4+5=9 and10. Insert 8 at position5. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s are moved to positions5 and6, and the 8 is inserted at4. But the 2 is at4. This would overwrite the 2. Not possible.\n\nAnother possible approach: In the test input, the 3s are in positions11-13, which are 7-9 positions after the 2. Following Example0's pattern of shifting right by6, but since the 3s are already to the right, maybe they are shifted left by a certain amount.\n\nIf the shift is to move the 3s to be 5 positions after the 8, perhaps:\n\nInsert 8 at position5. Then 3s are at positions6-8. But how much to shift left.\n\nOriginal 3s at12 and13. New positions6 and7. So shift left by6 positions (12-6=6). So:\n\nAfter shifting, the list becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,8,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis matches the pattern where the 8 is inserted at5, 3s after.\n\nBut why shift left by6? In Example0, the shift was right by6. Here, left by6.\n\nBut perhaps the shift amount is the same as in Example0, but direction depends on the relative position of 3s to the 2.\n\nIn Example0, the 3s were to the left of the 2, so shifted right. In the test input, the 3s are to the right of the 2, so shifted left.\n\nIf this is the case, then for the test input's first list:\n\n3s are at12 and13. Shift them left by (12 - (5 +2))=5. So 12-5=7. So new positions7 and8. Insert 8 at5.\n\nResulting list:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,8,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples.\n\nThis is getting too uncertain. Given that the test input's 3s are further to the right than the 2, and based on Example0's horizontal shift, perhaps the 3s are shifted left by a certain amount, and the 8 is inserted between the 2 and the 3s.\n\nAssuming that the 8 is inserted at position5 (as in Example0, where the 2 was at10 and the 8 was at5), for the test input's 2 at4, inserting the 8 at position5 makes sense.\n\nThen, the 3s are shifted left by 7 positions (12-5=7), moving them to positions5+1=6 and7. So:\n\nOriginal 3s at12 and13. Shift left by7 \u2192 positions5 and6. But wait, inserting the 8 at5, the 3s would be at6 and7. So the list becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,8,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis would match the pattern of inserting 8 after the 2 and before the 3s.\n\nApplying this to all four test input lists:\n\nFirst list's output:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut in Example0, the 3s were shifted and replaced with zeros. So perhaps zeros are filled in the original positions of the 3s.\n\nBut in the output examples, the original positions of the 3s are zeroed out. So in the test input's first list, the original 3s at12 and13 become 0, and the new positions6 and7 are3.\n\nBut according to the transformation in Example0, the 3s are moved and the 8 is inserted, with zeros elsewhere.\n\nSo applying this:\n\nTest input first list becomes:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWait, no. Because in Example0, the 3s were moved and zeros in their original places. So the output list has 3s in new positions and zeros elsewhere, except for the 2 and 8.\n\nSo for the first test input list:\n\nOriginal 3s at12 and13. After moving them to6 and7, those positions become3, and 12-13 become0. So the output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut in Example0's first output, the 3 was moved from1 to7, and the original position1 became0.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nApplying this to all four test input lists:\n\nFirst test input list:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAfter shifting 3s left by7 positions to6 and7, and inserting 8 at5:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSecond test input list:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOriginal 3s at11 and13. Shift left by7:11-7=4, 13-7=6. But inserting 8 at5. So positions4 and6:\n\nBut 4 is where the 2 is. So this can't be. So this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, the shift amount needs to avoid overwriting the 2. So perhaps the shift amount is 6 positions left for the first list, but for the second list, the 3s are at11 and13. Shifting left by6:11-6=5, 13-6=7. So inserting 8 at5:\n\nOutput becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,8,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but the original 3 at11 would move to5, but 5 is where the 8 is inserted. So conflict.\n\nAh, this indicates that the shift amount must be such that the 3s are moved to positions after the 8.\n\nAlternatively, the shift amount is calculated as (current position of 3) - (position of 8 +1). For example, in the first list's 3 at12:\n\nposition of 8 is5. 12 - (5+1)=6. So shift left by6:12-6=6. So new position6. But the 8 is at5, so 3 is at6. So the list becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,8,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis works. For the second list's 3s at11 and13:\n\n11 shifted left by6:11-6=5. 13-6=7. But position5 is where the 8 is inserted. So the 3 would conflict with the 8. This isn't possible. So perhaps the shift amount depends on the individual 3's position relative to the 8.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time, I think the safest assumption is that the 3s are shifted to the left by (current position - (position of 8 +1)), ensuring they are after the 8. For the test input, the 8 is inserted at position5. So for each 3 in the list:\n\nnew_position = current_position - (current_position - (5 +1)) =5 +1=6. So new_position =6.\n\nBut this isn't making sense.\n\nAlternatively, the shift amount is (current_position - (8_position +1)). For example, if the 3 is at12, and 8 is at5, then shift left by (12 - (5+1))=6. So 12-6=6. So new position6.\n\nThis would work. So for each 3, shift left by (current_pos - (8_pos +1)).\n\nFor the first test list's 3 at12:12- (5+1)=6 \u2192 new position6.\n\nThe second list's 3 at11:11-6=5. But 5 is where the 8 is. So conflict. So this approach is not correct.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the assumption that in the test input, each list's 3s are shifted left by7 positions (so that 12-7=5, but 5 is the position after the 2 at4. Insert the 8 at5, and move the 3s to positions6 and7.\n\nSo the first test input list becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,8,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe second test input list has 3s at11 and13. Shifting left by7:\n\n11-7=4 (overlaps with 2), 13-7=6. So this doesn't work. So this approach is invalid.\n\nAnother possible approach: Looking back at the examples, in Example0, the 3s are shifted to positions starting at 7, which is 2 positions after the 8 at5. So perhaps after inserting the 8, the 3s are placed two positions after the 8.\n\nFor the test input's first list:\n\nInsert 8 at5. Then place the 3s starting at5+2=7. So moving the 3s from12 and13 to7 and8:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,8,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis would fit.\n\nBut how many positions to shift? 12-7=5. So shift left by5 positions.\n\nApplying this to the second test input list:\n\n3s at11 and13. Shift left by5 \u2192 6 and8.\n\nSo the list becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,8,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThird test input list:\n\n3s at11-13. Shift left by5 \u21926-8.\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,8,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nFourth test input list:\n\n3 at11. Shift left by5 \u21926.\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,8,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis seems plausible. Then, according to the training examples, the 3s are grouped together after the 8.\n\nBut in Example0's outputs, the 3s are contiguous after the 8. In the test input's second list, the 3s would be at6 and8, leaving a zero in between. Which isn't contiguous. But in the input, the 3s are not contiguous either (positions11 and13). So perhaps the output preserves the original spacing but shifts them left.\n\nBut the training examples show that when the input's 3s are contiguous, the output's 3s are also contiguous. So perhaps the shift preserves the original grouping.\n\nIn the second test input list, the 3s are at11 and13. Shifting left by5 positions would move them to6 and8, which are not contiguous. But maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is such that the relative positions of the 3s are preserved. For example, if they are spaced 2 apart, they remain spaced 2 apart.\n\nBut this is getting too detailed. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the assumption that the 3s are shifted left by7 positions, inserting the 8 at5, and the 3s are placed starting at6. For the test input:\n\nFirst list's output: [0,0,0,0,2,8,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nSecond list: [0,0,0,0,2,8,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nThird list: [0,0,0,0,2,8,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nFourth list: [0,0,0,0,2,8,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis matches the training examples' style where 3s are moved and 8 inserted. But I'm not entirely confident. However, based on the examples provided, this seems like the most plausible pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input maps to the output. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, there are four rows. Each row has numbers like 3s and 2s. The output for each row seems to have the numbers shifted. For instance, in the first input row of Example 0: [0,3,0,...2,0...], the output becomes [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,3,...]. Hmm, the 3s are moved to later positions, and an 8 is introduced. Wait, looking at all the outputs in Example 0, each output row has an 8 in the fifth position (index 5 if we start at 0). Also, the 3s from the input seem to be shifted to positions around the 8. Maybe there's some kind of shift happening here. Also, the 2 in the input remains in the same place (index 10 in input and output for the first row of Example 0). So the 2s are staying, but the 3s are moving. And the 8 is added in a specific position.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has several rows with 3s and 2s. The output shifts some of these rows. The 2s are in the last row of the input, and in the output they're still there. The 3s from the input rows (like [3,3,0,0,0]) appear towards the bottom of the output, and there's a new row with all 8s. Similarly, in Example 2, the input has a row of 2s, followed by some 3s. In the output, the 3s are moved up, and an 8 row is inserted below them.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that all the 3s and 2s are being moved, but the 8s are inserted in a particular way. Wait, the 8s might be replacing some rows. Let me see the positions.\n\nIn Example 0, the original input rows have 3s in the first few positions. The outputs have the 3s shifted to positions 6,7, etc., and an 8 in position 5. So perhaps each input row is transformed by moving the 3s to the right by a certain amount, and inserting an 8 in a specific spot.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves stacking the 3s from all input rows into a certain position in the output, and inserting an 8 row. Wait, looking at Example 1's input: there are multiple rows with 3s. In the output, those 3 rows are moved to positions near the bottom, and the 8s are placed in a row above them. For instance, in Example 1's output, the row [8,8,8,8,8] is at index 10, and the 3 rows are below it. The 2s remain in their original position (last row before the final zero row). So maybe the 8s are placed at the position where the 2s are, but the 3s are moved below the 8s?\n\nWait, let's check Example 0. The input has 2 at position 10 in the input rows, and in the output, the 2 is still at position 10, but the 8 is at position 5. Hmm, maybe the 8 is introduced at a certain distance from the 2. Let's see the position of 2 in the input and where the 8 is in the output.\n\nIn Example 0, the input rows have 2 at index 10. In the output, the 8 is at index 5. The difference is 5 positions to the left. Wait, but the output array's length is the same as the input? Let me check. The input for Example 0 is 16 elements per row, the output is also 16 elements. So the 8 is placed at position 5, which is five positions before the 2's position 10. So 10-5=5. So maybe the 8 is placed 5 positions before the 2's position. But how does that apply when there are multiple rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is placed in the same row as the 2, but shifted. Wait, no. In Example 0, the 2 is in the same row, but the 8 is in the same row. Wait, the input rows in Example 0 each have a 2 at position 10. The output rows have 8 at position 5, then 3s following. So maybe in each row that has a 2, the 3s from other rows are shifted and the 8 is inserted in the same row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the process is that the 2s are kept in their original positions, and all the 3s from the input rows are collected and shifted to positions around where the 8 is placed. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1, the 2 is in the row [2,2,2,2,2], which in the output is still at the same position (row 15). The rows with 3s in the input are moved down to rows 11-14, and there's a row of 8s inserted at row 10. So the 8s are placed above the 3s and below the 2s. Wait, the 2s are in row 15 (if we count from 0, maybe?), but the 8s are in row 10. So maybe the 8s are placed a certain number of rows above the 2 row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the 8 is placed in a row that is a certain distance relative to the 2's position. But this might be getting complicated.\n\nAnother angle: the 2s in the input are preserved in their positions in the output. The 3s from the input are moved to positions either above or below the 8 row. The 8 row is inserted in a position that's determined by the location of the 2s. For example, in Example 0, each input row has a 2 at position 10. The output inserts the 8 at position 5 in the same row. The 3s from the input are shifted to positions after the 8. So in the first input row of Example 0, [0,3,0,...2,0...] becomes [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,3,...]. The 3 is moved from position 1 to position 7, and the 8 is at position 5. So maybe the 3s are shifted to the right by 6 positions (from 1 to 7), but that's 6 steps. But how does that relate to the 8's position?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are shifted such that they start after the 8. So in the output row, the 8 is placed at a certain position, then the 3s follow. For example, in the first output row of Example 0, after the 8 at index 5, there's a 3 at index 7. So maybe the 3s from the input are moved to be after the 8, but with some offset.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire input is transformed by taking the 3s and moving them to a position relative to where the 2s are. For instance, the 8 is placed a certain number of positions before the 2, and the 3s are arranged around that.\n\nLooking at the Test Input: each row has a 2 at position 4 (since the first row is [0,0,0,0,2,...]). The outputs need to be determined. Following the pattern from the examples, perhaps in each row, the 8 is placed a certain number of positions before the 2. Let's check in Example 0: the 2 is at position 10. The 8 is at position 5. The difference is 5 positions. So 10 -5 =5. So maybe the 8 is placed 5 positions before the 2. Then the 3s from the input are moved to positions after the 8. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row has a 3 at position 1. In the output, the 3 is at position 7. The 8 is at position 5, so 7 is 2 positions after 5. Maybe the 3s are placed two positions after the 8. But in another row of Example 0, the input has 3s at positions 1,2,3. The output has 3s at positions 7,8,9. So starting at 7, which is 2 positions after the 8 (position 5). So yes, the 8 is at position 5, and the 3s start at position 7. So the 3s are placed starting 2 positions after the 8. So the formula could be: for each row in the input, find the position of the 2 (which is fixed), insert an 8 at position (2_pos -5), and then shift the 3s to start at (8_pos +2). But wait, in the first example, 2 is at position 10. 10-5=5. So 8 is at position 5. Then the 3s start at 5+2=7. Which matches. So perhaps that's the pattern.\n\nLet's check Example 1. The 2 is in row 15 (the 16th element in the input, but the input is a list of rows). Wait, in Example 1's input, the 2 is in the row [2,2,2,2,2], which is the 16th row (since there are 17 rows in the input). The output has the 8s in row 10 (the 11th row). Then the 3s are in rows 11-14. So here, the 8 row is placed 5 rows above the 2 row (since 16-5=11, but rows are zero-indexed?), maybe. Wait, perhaps the rows are zero-indexed. So in Example 1's input, the 2s are in row 15 (since there are 17 rows: indexes 0 to 16). The 8s are in row 10. So 15 -5=10. So the 8 row is placed 5 rows above the 2 row. Then the 3s from the input (which are in rows 1-4) are moved to rows 11-14, which are 5 rows above the 8 row? Not sure. Maybe the rows are being reordered. For example, in Example 1's input, the 3 rows are in the top part. The output moves them to be just after the 8 row. So the 8 row is inserted, then the 3 rows are placed below it. But the 2 row remains in place.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 2s in row 3. The output inserts the 8 row at row 7. Then the 3s from input rows 10-12 are moved to rows 4-6. So here, the 8 is placed 4 rows below the 2 row (row 3 +4 = row 7). Hmm, this contradicts the previous idea. So perhaps the positioning of the 8 depends on some other factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is placed at a certain position relative to the 2's position in the same row. For example, in Example 0, the 2 is in position 10 of each row, and the 8 is placed at position 5. So same row, 10-5=5. In Example 1, the 2 is in the last row (row 15), and the 8 is in row 10. So row difference is 15-10=5. So perhaps the 8 is placed 5 positions (rows or indices) before the 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2 is in row 3. The 8 is placed in row 7. So 7-3=4. Hmm, that doesn't fit the 5 difference. Wait, maybe it's different because the direction changes. Or perhaps in Example 2, the 8 is placed 4 rows below the 2. So maybe the rule is that when the 2 is in a row, the 8 is placed either 5 rows above or below, depending on some condition. But this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is placed in the same row as the 2, but shifted left by 5. But in Example 0, that would be the case. In Example 1, the 2 is in row 15, and the 8 is in row 10, which is 5 rows above. So perhaps the rule is: for each 2 in a row, insert an 8 row 5 rows above the 2's row, and move the 3s from their original rows to be just below the 8 row.\n\nIn Example 0, each input row has a 2 in the same row (each input row is a row in the list). Wait, but in Example 0, there are four input rows. Each of them has a 2 at position 10. Then in the output, each of the four output rows has the 8 at position 5. So for each input row, the 8 is inserted 5 positions before the 2's position in that same row. Then the 3s are shifted to positions after the 8. So the pattern within each row is:\n\n1. The 2 remains in the same position.\n2. Insert an 8 five positions before the 2's position.\n3. The 3s from the input row are shifted to start two positions after the 8 (so 8_pos +2).\n\nSo in the first row of Example 0's input: 2 is at index 10. 8 is placed at 10-5=5. Then the 3s (originally at index 1) are moved to index 5+2=7. But in the output, the first row after the 8 at 5 has a 3 at 7. So yes.\n\nSimilarly, the second input row in Example 0 has 3s at 1,2,3. The output places them at 7,8,9 (after the 8 at 5). So this seems to fit.\n\nNow looking at Example 1: Each input row with 3s is moved down to be after the 8 row. Wait, but in Example 1, the 2 is in row 15 (assuming the input has 17 rows, 0-indexed). The 8 is placed in row 10. Then the 3s from the input's rows (rows 1-4) are placed in rows 11-14. So the 3 rows are moved to rows just after the 8 row. So the rule here could be that all the 3 rows from the input are moved to be just below the 8 row. So in this case, the 8 is placed 5 rows above the 2 row, and the 3 rows are moved to the rows immediately following the 8 row.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2 is in row 3. The 8 is placed in row 7 (which is 4 rows below). Then the 3 rows from the input (rows 10-12) are moved to rows 4-6, which are three rows above the 8 row. Wait, this seems inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe in Example 2, the 3 rows are placed above the 8 row. Hmm, the output in Example 2 has the 3 rows (originally 10-12 in input) moved to rows 4-6 in the output. The 8 row is at row 7. So the 3 rows are placed above the 8 row. So perhaps when the 2 is in an upper part of the input, the 8 is placed below and the 3 rows are moved to above. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to look for a more general pattern.\n\nIn all examples, the 2s remain in their original positions. The 8s are introduced in specific positions. The 3s from the input are moved to new positions.\n\nIn the Test Input:\n\nEach of the four input rows has a 2 at position 4. So for each row, according to the pattern observed in Example 0, the 8 should be placed at position 4-5= -1, which can't be. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, in Example 0, the 2 is at position 10. 8 is placed at 10-5=5, which is valid. But if the 2 is at position 4, then 4-5= -1, which is invalid. So perhaps the pattern isn't simply subtracting 5. Maybe there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8 is placed at a certain position relative to the 2's position in the row, but when that's not possible (like the 2 is near the start), the 8 wraps around or is placed elsewhere. But in the Test Input, each row has the 2 at index 4. So using the same rule as Example 0, the 8 would be at index 4-5= -1, which is invalid. So perhaps the Test Input is different.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern isn't per-row but per the entire structure. Let's think again.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has four rows, each with a 2 in position 10. The output has four rows, each with an 8 in position 5, and 3s shifted to positions after the 8. So per-row transformation.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has multiple rows, but the 2 is in a single row (the one with [2,2,2,2,2]). The output inserts an 8 row above that 2 row (five rows above?), and moves the 3 rows to be after the 8 row.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2 is in row 3. The output inserts the 8 row in row 7 (four rows below), and moves the 3 rows from input rows 10-12 to rows 4-6 (above the 8 row).\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the pattern is that all 3 rows are moved to a location near the 8 row, and the 8 is placed a certain distance from the 2 row. But the direction (above or below) might vary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is placed at the same position in the entire array where the 2 is, but shifted left by 5, and then 3s are arranged around. But this may not work for different row lengths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8 is placed in the same column as the 2, but in a different row. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is in the last row, and the 8 is placed in row 10. So 5 rows above. Then the 3s are moved to rows 11-14. So the 8 is in row 10, the 3s in 11-14, and the 2 remains in row 15. This seems to fit.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2 is in row 3. The 8 is placed in row 7 (4 rows below), and the 3s from input rows 10-12 are moved to rows 4-6 (which are above the 8 row). So here, the 8 is 4 rows below the 2, and the 3s are placed in rows between the 2 and the 8. But why 4 rows here and 5 rows in Example 1?\n\nHmm, perhaps the number of rows between the 8 and the 2 depends on the original position of the 2. For example, if the 2 is in row X, then the 8 is placed in row X-5. If X-5 is negative, maybe it wraps around or is placed at 0. But in Example 1, the 2 is in row 15, 15-5=10, which is where the 8 is. In Example 2, the 2 is in row 3. 3-5= -2, which is invalid. So maybe when X-5 is negative, the 8 is placed at X+5. So 3+5=8. But in Example 2, the 8 is in row 7. Which is one less than 8. So this doesn't fit exactly. Alternatively, maybe it's placed at (X +5) mod number of rows. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is always placed 5 rows away from the 2, either above or below, depending on the available space. For Example 0, since the 2 is in the same row, but per-row processing, perhaps the 8 is placed 5 positions before the 2 in the same row. But in the Test Input, that would be position 4-5= -1, which isn't possible. So perhaps there's a different rule when the 2 is near the start.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is placed in a fixed column. Looking at Example 0's output, the 8 is at index 5 in the row. Example 1's output has the 8 in the same column (all 8s in row 10 are in the first four columns?), but Example 1's output row 10 is [8,8,8,8,8]. So the 8s are in every column. Hmm, no, that's not columns. Wait, the examples have varying row lengths. Example 0's rows are 16 elements long. Example 1's rows are 5 elements. So the 8 is placed in the same column as the 2's column. For example, in Example 0, the 2 is at index 10, and the 8 is at index 5. But 10 is in the same row as the 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the 8 is placed in the same row as the 2, but shifted left by 5 positions. But when the 2 is in position 4, shifting left 5 would go to -1, which isn't possible. So maybe in such cases, the 8 is placed at the start of the row.\n\nLooking at the Test Input's first row: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0]. The 2 is at index 4. If we shift left by 5, 4-5= -1, which is invalid. So maybe the 8 is placed at the start of the row (index 0). Then the 3s (which are at indexes 12 and 13) are shifted to start at index 0 +2=2. But the output for this row would then have 8 at index 0, and 3s starting at 2. But the expected output might be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Test Input is a multi-row structure where the 2s are in column 4 of each row. The 8s would need to be placed 5 positions to the left in each row. But that's impossible for row length 18, as the 2 is at 4. 4-5= -1. So perhaps in such cases, the 8 is placed at the end. Or maybe the 8 is placed in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is different when the 2 is too close to the start. For example, if the 2's position minus 5 is negative, then the 8 is placed at position 0. So in the Test Input's first row, the 2 is at 4. 4-5= -1, so 8 is at 0. Then the 3s (at 12 and 13) would be shifted to 0+2=2. So the output row would be [8,0,3,3,2,...], but that may not match the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Test Input's rows are part of a larger structure. The Test Input has four rows. Each has a 2 at position 4, and 3s at varying positions. According to the previous examples, the output should have each row's 2 remaining in place, an 8 placed 5 positions before the 2 (if possible), and the 3s shifted to start after the 8.\n\nBut since 4-5 is -1, maybe the 8 is placed at position 0. Let's see:\n\nIn Test Input row 0: 2 at index 4. 8 at index 0. Then the 3s are at indexes 12 and 13. So shifting them to start at 0+2=2. But the 3s are in the original input at 12 and 13, which would need to be moved to positions 2 and 3. So the output row would have [8,0,3,3,2,...]. But the original input's 3s are in positions 12 and 13, which are in the same row. So the transformation would involve moving those 3s to earlier positions after the 8. \n\nBut how does this fit with the examples? In Example 0, the 3s were in the same row and moved to positions after the 8. So in this Test case, each row's 3s are moved to positions after the 8. But since the 8 is at position 0, the 3s would start at position 2.\n\nBut looking at the Test Input:\n\nTest Input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0]\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nEach row has 2 at index 4. The 3s are at varying positions.\n\nIf the 8 is placed at index 4-5= -1 \u2192 invalid. So maybe in this case, the 8 is placed at the beginning (index 0). Then the 3s are shifted to start at index 2. Let's see:\n\nFor Row 0: 3s are at 12 and 13. Moving them to 2 and 3. So the output row would be:\n\n[8,0,3,3,2,0,...] But the original zeros would remain, except where the 3s and 8 are.\n\nWait, but the original row has a lot of zeros. So after placing 8 at 0, the 3s would start at 2. So the output row would have:\n\n[8, 0, 3, 3, 2, ...] followed by zeros except for the 2. Similarly for other rows.\n\nBut looking at the output examples, sometimes the 3s are moved to positions after the 8. For example, in Example 0's first output row, after the 8 at 5, the 3 is at 7. So 5+2=7. So perhaps the 3s are shifted to start two positions after the 8.\n\nBut in the Test Input case, the 8 is at position 0. So the 3s would start at 0+2=2. So in Row 0, moving the 3s from 12 and 13 to 2 and 3. The 2 remains at 4.\n\nSo the transformed row 0 would be:\n\n[8, 0, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSimilarly for the other rows. For example, row 1 has 3s at 11 and 13. Those would move to 2 and 3. But row 1's input is:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo after transformation, it would be:\n\n[8,0,3,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but row 1's input has two 3s: at 11 and 13. Shifting them to 2 and 3 would replace those zeros. So output row would be [8,0,3,3,2, ...].\n\nSimilarly for row 2, which has three 3s (11,12,13) \u2192 shifted to 2,3,4. But 4 is where the 2 is. So perhaps the 2 remains in place, and the 3s are placed starting at 2, but overlapping with the 2's position. That might not make sense, unless the 2 takes precedence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are shifted to positions after the 8, but the 2's position is kept. So in row 0, 3s are at 12 and 13. After shifting, they would be at 2 and 3. The 2 is at 4. So 2 and 3 are before the 2. So the output row would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,8,0,3,3,2, ...] Wait, no. This is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire row is shifted. For example, each row's elements are shifted to the right by a certain amount, with the 8 inserted. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that the 8 is placed in the same position in each row where the 2 is, but in a different row of the output. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is in row 15. The 8 is in row 10. So 5 rows above. The 3s are moved to rows 11-14. So for the Test Input, which has four rows, each with 2 at position 4, perhaps the 8 is placed in a new row inserted five rows above the original 2's row. But the Test Input is four rows. How would that work?\n\nAlternatively, the Test Input's four rows are part of a larger structure. For example, each row is part of a grid where the 2s form a vertical line. Then the 8s are placed five positions to the left of the 2's column. But the rows have varying lengths.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Perhaps I should look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's input and output, the number of rows is the same. So each row is transformed individually. The output rows are modified versions of the input rows. So perhaps for each row:\n\n- The 2 remains in place.\n- The 8 is placed 5 positions before the 2's position in the same row.\n- The 3s are shifted to start two positions after the 8.\n\nIf the 8's calculated position is negative, then wrap around or place at the beginning.\n\nBut in the Test Input's case, the 2 is at position 4. 4-5= -1. So perhaps the 8 is placed at the start (position 0). Then the 3s start at 0+2=2.\n\nSo for each Test Input row:\n\nRow 0: 3s at 12 and 13 \u2192 move to 2 and 3.\n\nOutput row 0: [8, 0, 3, 3, 2, 0, ...]\n\nRow 1: 3s at 11, 13 \u2192 move to 2 and 3.\n\nOutput row 1: [8, 0, 3, 3, 2, ...]\n\nRow 2: 3s at 11,12,13 \u2192 move to 2,3,4. But 4 is where the 2 is. So maybe the 3s are placed at 2,3,4, and the 2 remains at 4. But that would overwrite the 2. So perhaps the 2 takes precedence. So the 3s are placed at 2,3, and 4 becomes 2. So the output row would be [8,0,3,3,2, ...].\n\nRow 3: 3s at 11 \u2192 move to 2.\n\nOutput row 3: [8,0,3,0,2, ...].\n\nBut looking at the examples, sometimes the 3s are spread out. For instance, in Example 0's first output row, the 3 is at position 7. So perhaps the 3s are placed starting two positions after the 8. If the 8 is at position 0, then the 3s start at 2. So that fits.\n\nSo the Test Input's output would be four rows, each starting with 8 at position 0, then zeros, then 3s starting at position 2, then the 2 at position 4, followed by zeros.\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, the output rows in Example 0 have the 8 at position 5, then 3s starting at 7. So that's two positions after.\n\nSo for the Test Input's rows, the 8 is at position 0 (since 4-5=-1 \u2192 0?), then the 3s start at 0+2=2. So yes.\n\nSo applying that to each row in the Test Input:\n\nTest Input Row 0: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput Row 0: [8, 0, 3, 3, 2, 0, ...] \u2192 but the original row has 18 elements. So positions 0 (8), 2 and 3 (3s), 4 (2), and the rest zeros.\n\nSimilarly for the other rows:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 Output: [8,0,3,3,2,0, ...] (3s at 2 and 3).\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 Output: [8,0,3,3,3,2, ...] (3s at 2,3,4, but since position 4 is where the 2 is, perhaps the 2 remains and the 3s are at 2,3, and 4 is 2. So the 3s are at 2,3, and the 2 is at 4. So the output would be [8,0,3,3,2,0,0,...].\n\nWait, but the input row 2 has three 3s. So in the output, they would be moved to positions starting at 2. So three 3s at 2,3,4. But position 4 is the 2. So maybe the 2 takes precedence, so the 3s are at 2,3, and 4 is 2. So the output row would be [8,0,3,3,2,0,...]. But that would lose one 3. Alternatively, the 3s are allowed to occupy the 4th position, overwriting the 2. But the examples show that the 2 remains in place. So the 2 must take precedence. Therefore, the 3s cannot overwrite the 2. So in the Test Input row 2, the three 3s would be placed at positions 2,3, and 4 (but position 4 is the 2). So only 2 and 3 are filled with 3s. But this leaves one 3 unplaced. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when shifting the 3s, the 2's position is skipped. So in Test Input row 2, the three 3s would be placed starting at 2, but when they reach the 2's position (4), they are placed after. So 2,3,5. But the original input row has 3s at 11,12,13. How would they fit?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are shifted left by 10 positions. For example, the 3s in positions 12 and 13 (row 0) would be moved to positions 2 and 3 (12-10=2, 13-10=3). For row 1, 3s at 11 and 13 \u2192 11-10=1, 13-10=3. But the 8 is at position 0, so perhaps the 3s are placed after the 8. So 3s would be at 2 and 3. So subtracting 9 positions. 12-9=3, 13-9=4. But position 4 is the 2.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Perhaps the correct approach is to take each input row, find the position of the 2, insert the 8 five positions before, and shift the 3s to start two positions after the 8. If the 8's position is negative, then place it at the start, and shift the 3s accordingly.\n\nSo for the Test Input rows:\n\nEach row has 2 at position 4.\n\nSo 4-5 = -1. So 8 is placed at position 0.\n\nThen the 3s are shifted to start at 0+2=2.\n\nSo all 3s in the input row are moved to positions starting at 2, filling consecutively.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow 0 has 3s at 12 and 13. So in the output, they're moved to positions 2 and 3.\n\nRow 1 has 3s at 11 and 13 \u2192 moved to 2 and 3.\n\nRow 2 has 3s at 11,12,13 \u2192 moved to 2,3,4. But position 4 is the 2. So perhaps in this case, the 3s are placed at 2,3,5. But the 2 is at 4. Alternatively, the 3s are placed at 2,3, and 4 becomes 2 and 3s. But the 2 must remain. So this is a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when the 3s would overlap with the 2's position, they are placed after the 2. For example, in row 2, the three 3s would be placed at 2,3,5. But the 2 is at 4. So the output row would have:\n\n[8, 0,3,3,2,3,0,...]\n\nBut this isn't seen in the training examples. However, in Example 0, there's a row where the 3s are placed after the 8 and before the 2, which is possible.\n\nBut the training examples don't have overlapping of 3s and 2s. So perhaps the 3s are placed in the available positions after the 8 and before the 2. In the Test Input row 2, the 2 is at 4. The 8 is at 0. So positions 2 and 3 are available. The third 3 would need to go to position 5 (after the 2). But the training examples don't have such a case, so it's unclear.\n\nThis is a bit of a puzzle, but given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to apply the pattern observed in the examples as closely as possible. For each row in the Test Input:\n\n- Place the 8 at position 0 (since 4-5=-1 \u2192 0).\n- Shift all 3s from their original positions to start at position 2 in the output row.\n- The 2 remains at position 4.\n- Fill any remaining 3s consecutively after position 2.\n\nSo for Test Input row 0:\n\nInput 3s at 12 and 13 \u2192 Output at 2 and 3.\n\nOutput row: [8,0,3,3,2,0,... all else zero].\n\nRow 1:\n\n3s at 11 and 13 \u2192 output at 2 and 3.\n\nOutput row: [8,0,3,3,2,0,...].\n\nRow 2:\n\n3s at 11,12,13 \u2192 output at 2,3,4. But 4 is 2's position, so only 2 and 3 get 3s, and the third 3 is omitted? Or perhaps the third 3 is placed after the 2 at position 5.\n\nBut according to the training examples, the 2 remains in place. So perhaps the 3s can't overwrite it. Therefore, the three 3s would be placed at 2,3, and 5.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the 3s are placed consecutively starting at 2, and the 2 is allowed to coexist. But in the training examples, the 2 and 3s are separate. So in the Test Input row 2's output, the 3s would be at 2,3,5.\n\nBut this is speculative. Given that the training examples show that the 3s are shifted to positions after the 8 and before the 2, perhaps the Test Input row 2's output would have 3s at 2,3, and 5, with the 2 at 4.\n\nBut how does this align with the examples?\n\nAlternatively, since the Test Input's 2 is at position 4 and the 8 is at 0, the 3s could be placed in the available positions between 0 and 4. So for three 3s, they would be at 2,3, and maybe 1. But in the training examples, the 3s start after the 8 by two positions. So for Test Input row 2, the 3s would be at 2,3,4. But position 4 is the 2. So this is conflicting.\n\nThis is a problem. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the safest way is to follow the pattern where the 3s are shifted to positions starting two after the 8, and if that's not possible, truncate or adjust. For the Test Input rows:\n\nEach row's output will be:\n\n[8,0,3,... (number of 3s) ...,2,...].\n\nFor row 0, two 3s at 2 and 3.\n\nFor row 1, two 3s at 2 and 3.\n\nFor row 2, three 3s at 2,3, and 5 (since 4 is the 2).\n\nFor row 3, one 3 at 2.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The training examples don't have such a case. However, looking at Example 0's output rows, the 3s are placed after the 8. Even if there's space between the 8 and the 2, they are filled.\n\nIn Example 0's first output row, the 8 is at 5, the 3 is at 7, and the 2 is at 10. So between 5 and 10, there's space, and the 3 is placed at 7. So in the Test Input's case, between 0 and 4, the 3s would be placed at 2,3, and possibly 4 (but 4 is the 2's position).\n\nPerhaps the rule is that the 3s are placed starting two positions after the 8 and continue, but if the 2 is in the way, the 3s are placed up to but not including the 2's position.\n\nSo for Test Input row 2, 3s would be at 2,3, and 4 is skipped (as it's the 2's position), then continue at 5. But this isn't seen in examples. But this is the best guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are placed consecutively starting at 2, and the 2 is placed at 4, regardless of any overlap. So in row 2, the output would have 3s at 2,3,4, and the 2 at 4, leading to a conflict. But the training examples don't have such a case. Since the 2 must remain, perhaps the 3s are placed up to 4, but the 2 overwrites position 4.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the 2 is at position 10, and the 3s are placed before that. So no overlap. So perhaps in the Test Input, the 3s are placed up to the position before the 2. So for row 2, the 3s are at 2,3, and 4 is the 2. So the third 3 would have to be placed after the 2, but that's not seen in the examples. Alternatively, the third 3 is omitted.\n\nBut this is just guessing. The correct answer likely follows the pattern where each row's 3s are moved to start two positions after the 8. In the Test Input's case, since the 8 is at 0, the 3s start at 2. So for each row:\n\n- Convert all 3s in the input row to be placed starting at position 2, consecutively.\n\n- The 2 remains at position 4.\n\n- The 8 is at position 0.\n\nSo for Test Input row 2, which has three 3s, they would be placed at 2,3,4. But 4 is the 2's position. So the 2 takes precedence, and the 3 at 4 is replaced by the 2. So the output row would have 3s at 2 and 3, and the 2 at 4. So the third 3 is lost. But this may not align with the training examples. However, in Example 0, all 3s are preserved, just moved.\n\nThis is a problem. Perhaps the correct approach is to preserve all 3s, even if it means overlapping with the 2. But the examples don't have overlapping 3s and 2s. So perhaps the answer is:\n\nFor each Test Input row:\n\n- Place 8 at position 0.\n\n- Shift all 3s to start at position 2, filling consecutively.\n\n- The 2 remains at position 4.\n\nSo for row 0, output is:\n\n[8,0,3,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1:\n\n[8,0,3,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2:\n\n[8,0,3,3,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, position 4 is the 2, but here the 3 is at 4. This conflicts. So perhaps the correct output for row 2 is:\n\n[8,0,3,3,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut the 2 is at position 4. So the 3 would overwrite the 2. But in the training examples, the 2 remains. So perhaps this is not allowed. Therefore, the 3s must be placed before the 2's position. So for row 2, the three 3s would be placed at 2,3, and 4 (overwriting the 2). But this would replace the 2 with a 3, which is not allowed. Hence, this approach is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are placed after the 2. But in Example 0, the 3s are before the 2. So this is confusing.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think the safest answer is to place the 8 at position 0, shift the 3s to start at position 2, and keep the 2 at position 4. For rows with more 3s than available positions (2,3, etc.), the 3s would continue past the 2. However, since the examples don't show this, it's uncertain. But given the examples, the pattern seems to be that the 3s are moved to the right by a certain amount, which in Example 0 is 6 positions (from 1 to 7: 1 +6=7). So perhaps the 3s are shifted right by (8_pos - original_pos +2). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of positions to shift the 3s is based on the position of the 8. For example, in Example 0, the 8 is at 5. The original 3s are at positions 1, which is shifted to 7. 7-1=6. So 6 positions to the right. How is 6 determined? It's 5 (8's position) + 2.\n\nSo maybe the shift amount is (8_pos +2) - original_pos. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s are shifted such that their new position is (original_pos - (2_pos - 8_pos)). Since in Example 0, 2 is at 10, 8 at 5. 10-5=5. So the 3s are shifted by 5 positions to the left. Original 3 at 1 \u2192 1-5= -4. Not possible. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Based on the training examples, the 8 is placed 5 positions before the 2 in the same row. The 3s are shifted to start 2 positions after the 8. In cases where the 2 is too close to the beginning, the 8 is placed at the start (0) and the 3s start at 2. So for the Test Input, the output rows would each start with 8 at 0, followed by zeros until the 3s start at 2, then the 2 at 4.\n\nSo the output for each Test Input row would be:\n\nFor example, first Test Input row:\n\n[8, 0, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSecond row:\n\n[8, 0, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThird row:\n\n[8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFourth row:\n\n[8, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut in the third row, the 2 is at position 4, and the three 3s are at 2,3,4. But that would overwrite the 2. So this might not be correct. However, given the examples, the 2 must remain. So perhaps the third 3 is placed after the 2 at position 5. So the output row would be:\n\n[8, 0, 3, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut this isn't seen in the training examples. \n\nAlternatively, the 3s are truncated to fit before the 2. So in row 2, the three 3s would be placed at 2,3, and the 2 at 4. The third 3 is omitted. So the output row would have two 3s. But the original row has three. This is conflicting.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nFor each row in the Test Input:\n\n- The 8 is placed at position 0.\n\n- All 3s in the input row are moved to start at position 2, consecutively.\n\n- The 2 remains at position 4.\n\n- Any 3s that would overlap with the 2 are placed after it.\n\nThus, the output rows would be:\n\nRow 0: [8,0,3,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [8,0,3,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [8,0,3,3,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [8,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis would match the pattern of placing the 3s after the 8 and before the 2 where possible, and after the 2 if necessary.",
