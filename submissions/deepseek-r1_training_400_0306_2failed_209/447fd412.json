        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a grid of numbers (0s, 1s, 2s), and the output is another grid where certain areas are filled with 1s. I need to understand how the input is transformed into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0: The input has some 2s and 1s. In the output, there are new 1s added in specific patterns. For instance, in rows 8 and 9 of the input, there are 2s towards the end. In the output, those rows have new 1s between the 2s. Also, further down, rows 10 and 11 have new 1s in certain positions, and rows 12 and 13 have a horizontal line of 1s. It looks like the 2s might be acting as boundaries, and the 1s are filling the space between them or around them.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some 1s and 2s scattered. The output adds 1s in a sort of cross or expanding pattern. For example, row 9 in the input has a 2 at the end. The output adds 1s around it, forming a horizontal line. Similarly, row 10 adds 1s in a cross-like shape. Maybe it's creating connections between 2s or expanding existing 1s?\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a block of 2s on the right side. The output adds a big horizontal block of 1s starting from the left edge up to the 2s. So, perhaps whenever there's a group of 2s, the 1s fill the area from the left edge to those 2s in their rows?\n\nPutting this together, maybe the rule is that for each row, if there are 2s present, the 1s are filled between the left edge and the first occurrence of a 2 in that row. Wait, in Example 0, the output rows 8 and 9 have 1s between the 2s. Wait, original input rows 8 and 9 have 2s at positions 3,4 and 9,10. In the output, between them (positions 5-8) are filled with 1s. So between the 2s, 1s are inserted. Similarly, in rows 10 and 11 of the output, there are 1s after some 0s. Maybe it's looking for pairs of 2s in a row and filling the space between them with 1s. Or maybe when a row has two separate 2 groups, the area between them is filled with 1s.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 2s starting at position 7, 8, 9 in rows 7-9. The output fills from the left edge up to the 2s with 1s. So rows 7-9 in the input have 2s starting at column 7. The output fills columns 0-6 with 1s. That's a big change. So maybe, for any row that has a 2, all the cells to the left of the leftmost 2 in that row are turned into 1s, except if there's already a 1?\n\nBut wait, in Example 0, the input row 8 has 2s at columns 3,4 and 9,10. The output fills columns 5-8 with 1s. So between the two groups of 2s. So maybe the rule is that in a row, between the leftmost and rightmost 2s, fill with 1s. So if there are two separate clusters of 2s, the space between them is filled. For example, in row 8 of Example 0's input, the leftmost 2 is at column 3, rightmost at 9. So from 3 to 9, but the existing 2s are at 3,4 and 9,10. So the output fills 5-8 with 1s. Wait, but in the output, it's from 3 to 10 (columns), but maybe the actual fill is between the two clusters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when there's a 2, the 1s spread out from existing 1s until they hit a 2. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output: In row 9, the input has a 2 in column 9. The output has 1s in columns 1,2,3. The original input in row 9 had 0s there. How does that happen? Maybe it's related to other rows. For example, maybe vertical connections. The 2 in row 3 (column 6) might influence the 1s in lower rows. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is created by expanding existing 1s and 2s. For instance, existing 1s might spread to adjacent cells unless blocked by 2s. But in Example 0, the original 1s are in rows 2,3,4. The output adds 1s in rows 8-13, which are far away. So that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s act as \"walls\" and the 1s fill regions bounded by them. Like in a maze, the 1s flood the area until they hit a 2. But how are the regions determined?\n\nLooking at Example 2, the 2s are on the right side, and the output fills the left side with 1s. So perhaps, in each row, all cells to the left of the leftmost 2 are turned into 1s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's row 8, the input has 2s starting at column 3. The output has 1s starting at column 5. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the vertical columns. If a column has a 2, then all the rows in that column below or above get filled with 1s. But Example 0's columns 3 and 4 have 2s in row 8 and 9, but the output adds 1s in rows 10 and 11, which are below. Maybe vertical expansion?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in a checkerboard pattern around the existing 1s and 2s. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's take another approach. Let's look at the differences between input and output for each example.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nLooking at row 8 in input:\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n\nOutput row 8:\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n\nSo between the two groups of 2s (positions 3-4 and 9-10), the 0s are replaced with 1s. Similarly, row 9 in input is same as row 8, and the output also fills between the 2s.\n\nThen in rows 10 and 11 of output, there's [0,...,0,1,1,0...], which might be due to the 2s in rows 8-9 in column 9-10. Maybe the 1s are spreading downward from the filled area in row 8-9?\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's output, row 9 has 1s where there was a 2 in column 9. So maybe vertical propagation. For instance, when a 2 is present, the 1s are filled in the rows below or above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a cellular automaton where 1s spread under certain conditions, but blocked by 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to fill all the regions that are enclosed by 2s. For example, in Example 0, between the 2s in rows 8-9, the area is filled with 1s. But how to define enclosed?\n\nAlternatively, think of 2s as forming horizontal barriers. In the input rows where there are 2s, the 1s fill the area between the leftmost and rightmost 2s in each row. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's row 8 input: leftmost 2 at column 3, rightmost at column 10. So the output fills from column 5 to 8 with 1s. Wait, columns 3-4 are 2s, then 5-8 are filled, and 9-10 are 2s again. So the filled area is between the two clusters of 2s. But how to determine that? Maybe the 2s are grouped, and the space between groups is filled. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in each row, the 0s that are between 2s are turned into 1s. So if a row has 2s, the 0s that are between the first and last 2 in that row become 1s.\n\nFor Example 0 row 8: first 2 at column 3, last 2 at column 10. All 0s between 3 and 10 (columns 5-8, since 3-4 are 2s) become 1s. That seems to fit. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 2's input row 7: the row has 2s starting at column 7. The first 2 is at column 7, last at column 9. So between 0 and 7, all 0s become 1s. But in the output, columns 0-6 are filled with 1s, which is from left edge to the first 2. Wait, the first 2 is at column 7. So from 0 to 6, but in Example 2's output for row 7, it's filled with 1s up to column 6. So maybe the rule is that in each row with 2s, the 0s to the left of the first 2 are converted to 1s, and the 0s between the first and last 2 are converted to 1s as well. Hmm, but in Example 0's row 8, the first 2 is at 3, last at 10. The 0s between 3 and 10 are filled, but also the left of the first 2 (columns 0-2) are not filled. So that theory might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: for each row, any 0 that is between two 2s (could be in the same row or adjacent rows) gets converted to 1. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output row 10 and 11: they have 1s in columns 7-8. The input rows 8-9 have 2s in columns 9-10, but those rows are above. How does that connection happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in a diamond-shaped pattern around existing 1s and 2s, but that's unclear.\n\nAnother angle: the output seems to have more 1s in regions that are adjacent to existing 1s and 2s. Maybe it's some sort of expansion where 1s spread until they hit a 2. For example, in Example 0, the original 1s are in rows 2-4. The output adds 1s in lower rows. But how? Unless the 1s are expanding downwards, but in Example 0, rows 8-9 are much lower and the 1s there are new.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 2s act as seeds, and 1s fill certain regions based on their position relative to 2s. For instance, in rows where there are 2s, 1s fill the spaces between them. But how?\n\nLet me re-examine Example 1's input and output. The input has a 2 in row 3, column 6. The output adds 1s in row 9, columns 1-3. How does that relate? Maybe there's a vertical alignment. The 2 in row 3, column 6 is in the middle. The output's 1s in row 9 are to the left. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating horizontal bridges between 2s in the same column across different rows. For example, if there are 2s in the same column in multiple rows, then the space between them is filled with 1s. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a horizontal mirror image of the 2s and fill the area between the original and mirrored 2s with 1s. But I don't see a clear mirroring in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 2s as forming the outline of a shape, and the 1s fill the interior. Like in a grid-based flood fill. But in Example 0, the 2s in rows 8-9 are in two separate groups. The output fills between them. So maybe if there's a horizontal line of 2s with a gap, the gap is filled with 1s.\n\nBut how does that apply to other examples. For Example 2, the 2s are in a vertical block. The output fills all the left side. So maybe if there's a vertical block of 2s, the entire left side of that row is filled with 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output adds horizontal lines of 1s in rows where there are 2s, extending from the left edge to the first 2 in the row. For Example 2's row 7, the first 2 is at column 7. So output fills columns 0-6 with 1s. That's what happens. In Example 0's row 8, the first 2 is at column 3. So output would fill columns 0-2, but in the output, those are 0s. So that theory doesn't fit.\n\nWait, Example 0's row 8 input has 2s at columns 3 and 4. The output fills columns 5-8 with 1s. That's the area after the first 2s. So perhaps the rule is different. Maybe in a row, after the last 2, fill with 1s. But in Example 2, it's filled before the first 2.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's try to find a pattern that applies to all three examples.\n\nExample 0's output adds 1s in the following regions:\n\n- Between the two groups of 2s in rows 8-9.\n- Below those rows, in rows 10-11, there are 1s in columns 7-8 and 9-10 (but original 2s are at 9-10 in rows 8-9). So perhaps the 1s spread down from the filled areas between the 2s.\n\nExample 1's output adds 1s around certain 2s. For instance, in row 9, there's a 2 in column 9. The output has 1s in columns 1-3. How does that connect? Maybe vertically, there's a 2 in row 3, column 6, and another in row 9, column 9. The 1s form a diagonal path? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in a way that connects the 2s in the input. For example, in Example 0, the 2s are in rows 2 and 8-9. The output's 1s form a path connecting these areas. But I'm not seeing a clear path.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 1s are added in the output and see what's common about those positions in the input.\n\nIn Example 0's output, new 1s are added in rows 8-13. The input has 2s in rows 8-9. The output's 1s in these rows are adjacent to the 2s. For example, rows 8-9 have 2s, and the 1s are between them. Then, rows 10-11 have 1s aligned with the previous ones, perhaps extending downward. Rows 12-13 have a line of 1s. Maybe it's a diamond or rectangular shape expanding from the initial 2s and 1s.\n\nAlternatively, think of each 2 as a seed that causes 1s to fill adjacent cells in certain directions. For example, a 2 might cause 1s to fill to the right, left, up, or down until another 2 is hit. But this varies per example.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation might involve mirroring the positions of 2s across some axis and filling with 1s. For example, if a row has 2s on the left and right, the middle is filled. But this isn't consistent across examples.\n\nWait, another observation: in Example 0, the input has a sort of \"bowtie\" shape with 2s on both ends. The output fills the middle between them with 1s. Similarly, in Example 2, the input has a solid block of 2s on the right. The output fills the left side with 1s. So maybe the rule is that in any row containing 2s, the 0s between the first and last occurrence of 2 in that row are replaced with 1s.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n\nExample 0 row 8 input has 2s at columns 3,4 and 9,10. First 2 at column 3, last at column 10. So 0s between 3 and 10 are replaced with 1s. But the existing 2s are at 3,4 and 9,10. So the 0s between 5-8 are replaced with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 2 row 7 input has 2s from column 7 to 9. First 2 at 7, last at 9. So 0s between 7 and 9 are replaced. Wait, but in the output, all 0s from column 0 to 6 are filled with 1s. That doesn't fit. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is different. Maybe the 0s to the left of the first 2 in the row are replaced with 1s, and the 0s between the first and last 2 are also replaced. Let's check:\n\nExample 2 row 7: first 2 at column 7. So 0s to the left (columns 0-6) are filled with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 0 row 8: first 2 at column 3. So 0s to the left (columns 0-2) would be filled, but in the output, those remain 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this theory works for Example 2 but not Example 0. So it's not consistent.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the 1s are filled between all pairs of 2s in the same row. For instance, in Example 0 row 8, there are two pairs of 2s (columns 3-4 and 9-10). The space between these two pairs (columns 5-8) is filled with 1s. So whenever there are multiple 2s in a row, the 0s between them are filled with 1s. But how about if there's a single 2?\n\nExample 1's row 3 has a single 2 at column 6. In the output, that row remains the same. So maybe when there's only one 2 in a row, nothing happens. But in Example 1's row 9 input has a 2 at column 9. In the output, there are 1s in columns 1-3. So that doesn't fit. Maybe the rule is different when there are multiple 2s in different rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s in adjacent rows form vertical columns, and the 1s fill the horizontal regions between them. For example, in Example 0, the 2s in rows 8-9 form a vertical block on the left and right. The 1s fill the horizontal space between them, creating a sort of rectangle.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern that fits all examples. Let's try to look for another commonality.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the 1s often form horizontal lines or blocks. Maybe the transformation involves adding horizontal lines of 1s in rows that are adjacent to rows containing 2s.\n\nFor example, in Example 0, the 2s are in rows 2,3,4 and 8,9. The output adds 1s in rows 8-13. So perhaps rows below the 2s get filled with 1s. But Example 1's 2s are in rows 3,4,6,8,9, etc., and the output adds 1s in row 9,10,11. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: the output might be a combination of horizontal and vertical expansions. For instance, every existing 1 and 2 in the input spreads in all four directions (up, down, left, right) until they hit a 2. Then, the areas covered by this expansion are filled with 1s.\n\nLet's see:\n\nExample 0's input has 1s and 2s in rows 2-4. If these spread outward, but blocked by 2s, they might form certain shapes. But the output's new 1s are in rows 8-13, which are far away. So that doesn't explain it.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s act as boundaries, and the 1s fill the enclosed areas. But how to determine the enclosed regions.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the input plus additional 1s that form a certain pattern relative to the 2s. For example, in each row, whenever there are two 2s, insert 1s between them. In rows with a single 2, do nothing.\n\nIn Example 0's row 8, two groups of 2s, so fill between them. In Example 2's row 7, a single group of 2s (from 7 to 9), but the output fills to the left of them. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, in rows with at least one 2, fill all 0s to the left of the leftmost 2 with 1s. But in Example 0's row 8, the leftmost 2 is at column 3, so columns 0-2 would be filled. But in the output, those columns are 0. So that's not correct.\n\nWait, in Example 2's output, the entire left side of the row is filled with 1s up to the 2s. So if the leftmost 2 is at column 7, fill columns 0-6. That works for Example 2. But why doesn't it apply to Example 0's row 8?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is different depending on whether there's a single 2 or multiple. If there's a single 2, fill to the left; if multiple, fill between. But that seems inconsistent.\n\nMaybe the answer is to fill between pairs of 2s in the same row. So for Example 0's row 8, between the two 2 clusters. For Example 2's row 7, since the 2s are contiguous, there's no gap, so fill to the left. Wait, but in Example 2's input row 7, the 2s are from column 7 to 9. The output fills columns 0-6 with 1s. So maybe the rule is: for each row, if there are 2s present, fill all 0s to the left of the leftmost 2 with 1s. Then, for any 0s between 2s, fill those as well.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 8, the leftmost 2 is at column 3, so fill columns 0-2. But in the output, those are 0s. So that contradicts.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to see what the Test Input would look like if I apply some of these possible patterns.\n\nTest Input's rows:\n\nRow 2: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, ...]. So there's a 1 in column 2 and a 2 in column 12. Maybe between these two, but they are far apart. Or maybe fill to the left of the 2.\n\nRow 3: [0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, ...]. So leftmost 2 at column 4. Maybe fill columns 0-3 with 1s, but existing 1 is at column 2. So output would have 1s in 0-3.\n\nRow 8-10: 2s at columns 18-20. So for those rows, leftmost 2 is at 18. Fill columns 0-17 with 1s. But the output might show that.\n\nRow 11-12: 2s at columns 5-6. So fill columns 0-4 with 1s.\n\nIf the pattern is to fill all 0s to the left of the leftmost 2 in each row, then in rows where there's a 2, the left side is filled with 1s. Let's see if that fits the training examples.\n\nIn Example 2's row 7, leftmost 2 is at 7. So fill 0-6 with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 0's row 8, leftmost 2 is at 3. So fill 0-2 with 1s. But output row 8 starts with 0s. So this doesn't fit. Therefore, this pattern is invalid.\n\nAlternative idea: in each row, if there's at least one 2, fill all 0s to the right of the rightmost 2 with 1s. But in Example 0's row 8, rightmost 2 is at 10. So fill 11-... with 1s. But output has 0s there. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the 1s are filled in rows where there are 2s in the same column in multiple consecutive rows. For example, if a column has 2s in several rows, the area to the left or between them is filled with 1s.\n\nIn Example 0's rows 8-9, columns 3-4 and 9-10 have 2s. These are two vertical blocks. The output fills between them. So maybe when two vertical blocks of 2s are present in adjacent columns, the horizontal space between them is filled with 1s.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to fill. For Example 0, the two vertical blocks are at columns 3-4 and 9-10. So the horizontal gap is columns 5-8. Filling those with 1s matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2, there's a vertical block of 2s starting at column 7. The output fills columns 0-6 with 1s. So if there's a vertical block, fill to the left of it.\n\nIn Example 1, there are scattered 2s. For example, row 3 has a 2 at column 6, and row 6 has a 2 at column 6. These form a vertical line. Maybe fill between them. But the output has 1s in row 9, which is below. Not sure.\n\nThis is tricky. Perhaps the correct approach is to look for the Test Input's expected output based on the patterns observed.\n\nIn the Test Input, the rows to look at are:\n\nRow 8-10: 2s at columns 18-20. So for each of these rows, if the leftmost 2 is at 18, then fill columns 0-17 with 1s. So the output rows 8-10 would start with 1s up to column 17, then 2s.\n\nRow 11-12: 2s at columns 5-6. So fill columns 0-4 with 1s.\n\nRow 3: 2 at column 4. So fill columns 0-3 with 1s. Existing 1s at column 2. So output would have 1s in 0-3, but the existing 1 is at 2, so maybe merging.\n\nRow 2: 2 at column 12. So fill columns 0-11 with 1s. But existing 1 at column 2.\n\nSo applying this, the output would have:\n\nRow 8-10: [1,1,...,1,2,2,2,0].\n\nRow 11-12: [1,1,1,1,1,2,2,0,...].\n\nRow 3: [0,0,1,0,2,...] \u2192 but filled to the left of 2. So columns 0-3 are filled with 1s. Original row 3 input: [0,0,1,0,2,0,...]. Output would be [1,1,1,1,2,0,...].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, especially Example 2, where filling to the left of the first 2 in a row, this seems plausible.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 8, why isn't it filled to the left of the first 2? Because in that row, the first 2 is at column 3, but the output doesn't fill columns 0-2. So this theory is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to fill between the first and last occurrence of 2 in each row. If there's only one 2, then fill nothing. But in Example 2's row 7, the first and last 2 are the same, so the fill is between them. But that would be nothing. But the output fills to the left. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for another pattern. Let's think about the number of 1s added. In Example 0's output, new 1s form horizontal lines. In Example 1's output, there are cross-like patterns. Maybe the transformation is to create a horizontal mirror image of the 2s and fill between them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s in the input are acting as the vertical boundaries, and the output adds horizontal lines connecting them. For instance, if two 2s are in the same column in different rows, the output connects them with 1s.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on what seems to fit the examples.\n\nBased on Example 2, when a row has a block of 2s on the right, the output fills the entire left side with 1s. So applying that to the Test Input's rows 8-10 (2s at columns 18-20), the output would fill columns 0-17 with 1s. Similarly, rows 11-12 have 2s at 5-6, so columns 0-4 would be 1s.\n\nFor row 2, which has a 2 at column 12, the output would fill columns 0-11 with 1s. But there's a 1 at column 2, which would be part of the filled area.\n\nRow 3 has a 2 at column 4. So fill columns 0-3 with 1s. Original row 3 has 1 at column 2, so the filled 1s would overlap.\n\nRow 4 has 1s in columns 2-4, but no 2s. So no change.\n\nRow 5-7: no 2s, so no change.\n\nRows 8-10: filled with 1s up to column 17.\n\nRows 11-12: filled with 1s up to column 4.\n\nSo the Test Input's output would have these filled regions.\n\nLet me try to write out the transformed Test Input based on this assumption.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids to the output grids in the training examples, then apply that to the test input. Let me look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some 2s and 1s. The output seems to add more 1s in certain areas. For instance, in rows 8 and 9 of the input, there's [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0], and the output changes those middle zeros to 1s, making [0,0,0,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,0]. Similarly, lower rows add some 1s. Maybe it's something like filling the regions adjacent to existing 1s or 2s? Or perhaps expanding them in a specific pattern?\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has some 2s and 1s scattered. The output adds 1s around them. For instance, the row starting with [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0] in input becomes [0,1,1,1,0,...] in output. It looks like wherever there's a 2, the output adds 1s in a cross or plus shape around it? Or maybe creating a diamond pattern? Wait, in Example 1's output row 9: [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. The 2 is at position 9, and there are 1s to the left. Hmm. Or maybe it's adding 1s in certain directions based on neighboring cells?\n\nAnother observation: the outputs in the examples have 1s added in regions that are adjacent to existing 1s or 2s, but perhaps following a specific direction. For example, in Example 0's output, the added 1s form horizontal lines. In Example 2's input, there's a block of 2s in the lower middle, and the output adds a lot of 1s to the left of those 2s, filling the entire left side of the rows with 1s. Like, rows 7,8,9 in the input have 2s starting at column 8, and the output fills columns 0-6 with 1s in those rows. So maybe when there's a 2, the output fills all cells to the left up to a certain point with 1s? Or maybe expanding 2s into 1s in a particular direction.\n\nWait, in Example 2's output, the 2s are in the same place as the input, but the left side is filled with 1s. It's as if, for each 2 in the input, the entire row to the left of it (up to a certain point) is filled with 1s. For example, in row 7 of Example 2's input, the 2s start at column 7. In the output, the row starts with seven 1s, then the 2s. So that's 7 1s followed by 2s. But why seven? Because the original 2s are at position 7, maybe the number of 1s is determined by the position. Or maybe it's filling all cells to the left of the 2s with 1s, regardless of their original content.\n\nWait, the input rows 7,8,9 in Example 2 are [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0], and the output becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,0,0]. So the 2s are at columns 7,8,9. The output fills all columns from 0 to 6 with 1s. So the pattern here is that whenever there's a 2 in a row, all cells to the left of it (up to the first occurrence of a 2?) are replaced with 1s. But in Example 0, the input has 2s in columns 3 and 4 (row 8), and in the output, the 1s are between those 2s and the next 2s. Wait, let's check Example 0's input row 8: [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]. The output row 8 becomes [0,0,0,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,0]. So between the two pairs of 2s, there's a block of 1s. So perhaps between 2s in the same row, fill with 1s. Or maybe when there's a 2, the cells to the right and left up to another 2 are filled with 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that 2s act as boundaries, and the regions between 2s in the same row are filled with 1s. For instance, in Example 0's row 8, the input has 2s at positions 3 and 4, then later at positions 9 and 10. The output fills the positions between 4 and 9 (columns 5-8) with 1s. So between the two groups of 2s, insert 1s. But how does this apply to other examples?\n\nIn Example 1's input, there's a 2 at position 6 in row 3, and in the output, there's a 2 in the same spot. Then in row 9 of the input, there's a 2 at position 9. In the output row 9, the 2 remains, but there are 1s to the left. For example, the output row 9 is [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. So maybe when a 2 is present, the cells to the left (but how many?) are filled with 1s. But in this case, the 1s are three in a row starting at column 1. How does that relate to the 2's position?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in the same positions relative to the 2s in the input. For example, if there's a 2 in a cell, then certain neighboring cells are set to 1. Looking at Example 1's output row 9: the 2 is at column 9. The output has 1s in columns 1,2,3. That's not adjacent. Wait, maybe it's a different pattern.\n\nWait, looking at all examples, perhaps the 2s in the input are acting as 'seeds' for generating 1s in the output, but the way they do that depends on their position and surrounding cells. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, after the 2s in row 8 (columns 3,4 and 9,10), the output fills the space between them with 1s. So for each pair of 2s, the cells in between are filled with 1s. Similarly, in Example 2, the 2s are in columns 7-9, and the output fills the left of them (columns 0-6) with 1s. So maybe the rule is that for each 2 in the input, all cells to the left until the start of the row or until another 2 is encountered are filled with 1s. Wait, but in Example 0's row 8, between the two pairs of 2s (columns 3-4 and 9-10), the output fills columns 5-8 with 1s. That's between them, but the cells to the left of the first 2s (columns 0-2) remain 0. So that doesn't fit the \"left of 2s\" idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when there are consecutive 2s in a row, the output fills the regions between them with 1s. Like in Example 0, between the 2s at 3-4 and 9-10, there's a gap filled with 1s. Similarly, in Example 2, the 2s are in columns 7-9, and to the left, the entire row is filled with 1s up to that point. So maybe if there are 2s in a row, the output fills the entire row from the first 2 to the last 2, replacing 0s with 1s. Wait, in Example 0's row 8, the 2s are at 3-4 and 9-10. The output fills the 5-8 columns (0s between the two groups) with 1s. So between the two groups of 2s, replace 0s with 1s. And in Example 2, since the 2s start at column 7, the entire left side up to column 6 is filled with 1s. So perhaps whenever there's a 2 in a row, the output fills all 0s to the left of the leftmost 2 and to the right of the rightmost 2 in that row with 1s? Wait, no. In Example 0's row 8, the leftmost 2 is at column 3. So left of that would be columns 0-2, which are 0s in the output. But in the output, they remain 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output fills the gaps between 2s in the same row with 1s. So in Example 0, between 3-4 and 9-10, columns 5-8 are filled. In Example 2, since the 2s start at column 7 and go to 9, the output fills all 0s from the start of the row up to column 6 with 1s. Wait, but why? Because there are no 2s before column 7. So perhaps the leftmost 2 in a row determines that all cells to the left of it are filled with 1s? Let me check Example 2's input row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0]. The leftmost 2 is at column 7. The output fills columns 0-6 with 1s. So yes, that's the case. Similarly, in Example 0's row 8, the leftmost 2 is at column 3. The output fills from column 3 onwards? No, because between 3-4 and 9-10, the 1s are in the middle. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s in a row create a horizontal \"bar\" of 1s extending to the left and right. But in Example 0, the 1s are between the two groups of 2s. In Example 2, the 1s are to the left of the 2s. So perhaps when there are multiple 2s in a row, the regions between them are filled with 1s, and also any regions adjacent to the 2s. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output for each example and see what exactly changes.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput row 8: [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\n\nOutput row 8: [0,0,0,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,0]\n\nSo between the two 2s (columns 4 and 9), the 0s are replaced with 1s. So the 2s act as boundaries, and the 0s in between are filled with 1s.\n\nIn row 9 of the same example, the input is the same as row 8, and the output is the same as row 8's output.\n\nIn rows 10 and 11 of the output, there are 1s added. For example, output row 10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0]. Looking at the input, rows 10 and 11 are all 0s. So where did the 1s come from? Maybe there's another rule here. Let's check the input for other rows. Maybe vertical neighbors of 2s or 1s are being filled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a cellular automaton where certain rules apply. Like, for each cell, if it's a 0, check surrounding cells (like in Conway's Game of Life) and turn into 1 or 2 based on neighbors. But in the examples, the 2s in the input remain 2s in the output, so maybe 2s are fixed and 1s can be added.\n\nBut looking at Example 0's output rows 10 and 11, the 1s are in columns 7-8 and 7-8 again. Let's see if in the input, those positions were adjacent to existing 1s or 2s. In the input, rows 8 and 9 have 2s in columns 3,4,9,10. So how would that affect rows 10 and 11? Maybe there's a vertical spread of 1s downward from certain positions. For example, the 1s added in row 10's columns 7-8 could be below the 1s in rows 8 and 9's columns 5-8. So perhaps 1s spread downward? But then, why in those columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in a diamond pattern around the original 1s and 2s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by mirroring parts of the input. For example, in Example 0, the 1s added in rows 8 and 9 form a horizontal line between the 2s, and then below that, in rows 10 and 11, there's a vertical line of 1s. Maybe it's creating a cross shape.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try another angle. Let's see if the number of 1s added relates to the positions of the 2s.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2s are in columns 7-9 of rows 7-9. The output fills columns 0-6 with 1s. So maybe whenever there's a 2 in a row, all cells to the left of the leftmost 2 in that row are filled with 1s. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 0's row 8, the leftmost 2 is at column 3. So according to this rule, the cells to the left (columns 0-2) would be filled with 1s. But in the output, those are still 0. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output fills the area between the first and last 2 in a row with 1s. For Example 0's row 8: first 2 at column 3, last at column 9. The output fills columns 5-8. Wait, that's not the entire range. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in Example 0's row 8, the 2s are at columns 3,4,9,10. So the first 2 is at 3, last at 10. The output fills columns 5-8 with 1s. So perhaps the 1s fill the gaps between consecutive 2s. Wait, but there's a gap between column 4 (which is a 2) and column 9 (also a 2), but those are separated by columns 5-8. So filling that gap with 1s.\n\nIn Example 2's row 7, the 2s start at column 7. So the first 2 is at 7, and there are no 2s after that. But in the output, the entire left side (columns 0-6) are filled with 1s. So perhaps the rule is: for each row, if there is at least one 2, then fill all 0s to the left of the leftmost 2 with 1s, and fill all 0s between consecutive 2s with 1s. But in Example 0's row 8, the leftmost 2 is at 3, but the cells to the left (0-2) are not filled. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when there are two separate groups of 2s in a row, the space between them is filled with 1s. So in Example 0's row 8, between the two groups (columns 3-4 and 9-10), the space (columns 5-8) is filled. In Example 2, since all 2s are contiguous (columns 7-9), there's no gap, so all the left of them (columns 0-6) are filled. Wait, but why fill the left? Unless the rule is to fill to the left of the leftmost 2 in the row. So, if there's a 2 in the row, fill all 0s to the left of the leftmost 2 with 1s, and also fill any gaps between 2s.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 8, the leftmost 2 is at column 3, but the left of that isn't filled. So that's a problem. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output combines horizontal and vertical expansions. Like, for each 2, add 1s around it in certain directions. For example, in Example 1's output row 9, the 2 at column 9 has 1s to the left (columns 1-3). How did that happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are generated in a pattern that depends on the number of 2s in adjacent rows. This seems complicated, but maybe there's a pattern where the 1s are added in rows below or above where 2s are present.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's output, the rows with 2s (7,8,9) have their left sides filled with 1s. So the rule could be: for any row that contains a 2, fill all cells to the left of the leftmost 2 in that row with 1s. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 2's row 7, the leftmost 2 is at column 7. So fill columns 0-6 with 1s. Which is what happens in the output. In Example 0's row 8, the leftmost 2 is at column 3. According to this rule, columns 0-2 would be filled, but in the output, they remain 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the leftmost 2 in the entire grid determines the fill. But that doesn't seem to be the case either.\n\nLet's think about another approach. Maybe the output is generated by some kind of flood fill algorithm. For instance, starting from certain cells (like 2s), and filling adjacent cells with 1s under certain conditions. For example, if a 2 is present, fill all 0s in the same row to the left and right with 1s until another non-zero cell is encountered.\n\nIn Example 2's row 7: the 2s start at column 7. The output fills all 0s to the left (columns 0-6) with 1s, but leaves the 2s in place. So if the rule is: in any row with a 2, fill all 0s to the left of the leftmost 2 with 1s, and fill between 2s with 1s. Then, in Example 0's row 8, between the two groups of 2s, the 0s are filled with 1s. But the 0s to the left of the leftmost 2 (columns 0-2) are not filled. So why? Maybe because there are no 2s to the left of that, but in Example 2's case, the entire row is filled. So perhaps the rule is different when there's a contiguous block of 2s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to fill all 0s in the same row between the first and last occurrence of 2 with 1s. So in Example 0's row 8, the first 2 is at column 3, last at column 10. The output fills columns 3-10 with 2s and 1s in between. But in the output, the 2s are at 3-4 and 9-10, and the middle is filled with 1s. So between the first and last 2 in the row, any 0s are replaced with 1s. But in Example 2's row 7, first 2 is at 7, last at 9. So between 7 and 9, which are 2s, the existing 2s remain, but the 0s to the left of the first 2 are filled. Wait, that doesn't fit. Unless the rule is to fill between the first and last 2 in the row, but also to the left of the first and right of the last? No, because in Example 0's row 8, the left of the first 2 (columns 0-2) are not filled.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to find a different pattern. Maybe the 1s are added in a diamond shape around each 2. But looking at Example 1's output row 9: the 2 is at column 9, and there are 1s at columns 1-3. That doesn't seem like a diamond.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output row 9: [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. The 2 is at column 9. The 1s are at columns 1-3. How does that relate? Maybe it's a diagonal? For example, the 1s are three cells to the left of the 2 in the same row. But 9-3=6, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions that are a certain distance from the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 1s added corresponds to the number of 2s in adjacent rows. For example, in Example 1's row 9, the 2 is in column 9. The output has 1s in columns 1-3. Not sure.\n\nLet's look at Example 1's input and output more closely. The input has a 2 in row 3, column 6. The output keeps that 2. In row 6, there's a 2 at column 6. The output keeps it. Then in row 8, a 2 at column 2. Output has 2 there. Row 9's input has a 2 at column 9. Output has 2 there. But in the output, row 9 has 1s in columns 1-3, row 10 has 1s at column 2 and 8-10, etc. So perhaps each 2 in the input causes a vertical line of 1s extending upward and downward, but offset to the left.\n\nFor instance, in Example 1's output row 9, the 2 is at column 9, and there's a horizontal line of 1s three positions to the left. Maybe each 2 creates a horizontal line of 1s three cells to the left. But that's arbitrary. Alternatively, the number of 1s added is based on the row difference. For example, if a 2 is in row X, then in row X+3, add 1s to the left. But in Example 1's case, the 2 in row 9 (input) has 1s in row 9 (output) itself, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions that form a pattern when viewed across multiple rows. For example, a diagonal line. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to find a common transformation across all examples.\n\nIn all examples, the output has more 1s than the input. The 2s remain in the same positions. The 1s are added in certain positions that seem to form horizontal blocks or fill between 2s. Let's focus on the rows where changes occur.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nInput row 8: [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\n\nOutput row 8: [0,0,0,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,0]\n\nSo between the two groups of 2s, four 1s are added. The same in row 9. Then in rows 10 and 11, new 1s are added at columns 7-8 and 7-8 again. Also, in the output rows 12 and 13, there are 1s added in columns 5-10.\n\nExample 1's output adds 1s in various positions, like row 9's columns 1-3, row 10's columns 2 and 8-10, etc.\n\nExample 2's output fills entire left parts of rows with 1s.\n\nMaybe the rule is that in each row containing 2s, the output replaces all 0s between the first and last 2 with 1s. For Example 0's row 8, the first 2 is at 3, last at 10. The 0s between them (5-8) are replaced with 1s. But why not columns 3-4 and 9-10? Oh, because those are already 2s. So in that case, the 0s between the leftmost and rightmost 2 in the row are replaced with 1s. \n\nIn Example 2's row 7, the first 2 is at 7, last at 9. The 0s between them (7-9) are 2s, so no 0s. But the output fills columns 0-6 with 1s. So this contradicts the previous idea.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each row, if there's at least one 2, then all 0s to the left of the leftmost 2 and to the right of the rightmost 2 are replaced with 1s. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's row 8: leftmost 2 at 3, rightmost at 10. So 0s to the left (0-2) should be 1s. But in the output, they remain 0. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the opposite: fill the 0s between the leftmost and rightmost 2s with 1s. For Example 0's row 8, between 3 and 10, which includes the 2s at 3-4 and 9-10, the 0s in between (5-8) are filled with 1s. That works. For Example 2's row 7, between 7 and 9 (the leftmost and rightmost 2s), there are no 0s (since those positions are all 2s), but the output fills columns 0-6 (left of leftmost 2) with 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So perhaps there are two rules:\n\n1. In a row, fill all 0s between the leftmost and rightmost 2s with 1s.\n\n2. Also, fill all 0s to the left of the leftmost 2 in the row with 1s.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 8, the leftmost 2 is at 3. So rule 2 would fill 0-2 with 1s, but the output doesn't. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, rule 1: between leftmost and rightmost 2s, fill 0s with 1s. Rule 2: to the right of rightmost 2, fill with 1s. But that's not what's happening.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rules depend on the presence of multiple 2s. If there are two separate groups of 2s in a row, fill the gap between them. If there's a single group, fill to the left. \n\nIn Example 0's row 8: two groups, fill between. In Example 2's row 7: single group, fill to the left. That seems to fit.\n\nTesting this hypothesis:\n\n- For any row in the input:\n\n   - If there are multiple groups of 2s (separated by 0s), fill the gaps between them with 1s.\n\n   - If there's a single group of 2s, fill all 0s to the left of the leftmost 2 with 1s.\n\nSo in Example 0's row 8, two groups of 2s (3-4 and 9-10). Fill the gap (5-8) with 1s. \n\nIn Example 2's row 7, a single group (7-9). Fill 0s to the left (0-6) with 1s.\n\nIn Example 1's input, let's look at row 9: input has a 2 at column 9. Output fills columns 1-3 with 1s. So according to the rule, since there's a single group of 2 (only one 2), fill to the left. But the left of column 9 is columns 0-8. But in the output, only columns 1-3 are filled. That doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the rule is different. Let's look at another example.\n\nIn Example 1's output row 9: [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. The input has a 2 at column 9. The output has 1s at columns 1-3. How is that determined? \n\nMaybe the number of 1s added is related to the distance from the 2. For example, three cells to the left. But 9-3=6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are added in a way that mirrors the arrangement of 2s in other rows. For example, in Example 1's input, there's a 2 in row 3, column 6. The output's row 9 has 1s, maybe related to that. But I'm not seeing a connection.\n\nThis is challenging. Let's try to look for any other patterns. For instance, in Example 0's output, the added 1s form a kind of 'bridge' between the two groups of 2s. In Example 2, the 1s form a solid block to the left of the 2s. In Example 1, the 1s are in various positions, like a horizontal line three cells to the left of a 2.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is created by adding 1s in a specific pattern relative to each 2 in the input. For example, for each 2 in the input, add 1s in a cross shape (up, down, left, right). But looking at Example 0's input row 8, the 2s are at 3,4,9,10. Adding a cross would add 1s around them, but the output has 1s in between the 2s. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each 2 in the input, the output adds 1s in a diamond shape expanding outward. But again, not sure.\n\nLet me try to think of the problem as a grid transformation where 2s are fixed, and 1s are added based on certain rules. The key is to find the rules that apply to all examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the added 1s are in between the two groups of 2s. Also, below those groups, there are more 1s added in rows 10-13.\n\nIn Example 1, the 1s are added in various places, such as row 9's columns 1-3, which is three positions to the left of the 2 at column 9. Similarly, row 10 has 1s at column 2 and 8-10. Maybe these are related to other 2s in adjacent rows.\n\nIn Example 2, the 1s are added to the left of the 2s in the same rows.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output adds 1s in a way that connects different 2s. For example, creating a path between 2s. In Example 0, the 1s connect the two groups of 2s horizontally. In Example 2, the 1s form a solid block to the left of the 2s. In Example 1, the 1s seem to form a diagonal or some other path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in a way that mirrors the positions of 2s in other rows. For example, a 2 in a higher row causes 1s to be added in lower rows.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Let's try to code a possible rule based on what we see.\n\nRule proposal:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- Identify all positions where there are 2s.\n\n- For each such row, between the leftmost and rightmost 2 (inclusive), replace all 0s with 1s.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 8, the leftmost is 3, rightmost is 10. So replacing 0s between 3 and 10 with 1s. The input row 8 has 2s at 3,4,9,10. So between 3 and 10, the 0s at 5-8 would become 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2's row 7: leftmost 2 is 7, rightmost 9. So between 7 and 9, all 0s are replaced with 1s. But there are no 0s between 7 and 9 (they are all 2s). But the output fills the left of 7 (columns 0-6). So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but if the rule is to replace between leftmost and rightmost 2s with 1s, including the leftmost and rightmost, but in Example 2's case, since the leftmost is 7 and the rightmost is 9, the 0s to the left of the leftmost 2 are not included. So this rule doesn't explain Example 2.\n\nAlternative rule: for each row with at least one 2, replace all 0s to the left of the rightmost 2 with 1s. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's row 8: rightmost 2 is at 10. Left of 10 is columns 0-9. But in the output, only columns 5-8 are filled. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is a combination of the input and some kind of expansion where each 2 generates a horizontal line of 1s extending to the left and right. For example, each 2 in a row generates 1s in both directions until another non-zero cell is encountered.\n\nIn Example 0's row 8, each 2 would generate 1s to the left and right until they hit another 2. So between the two groups of 2s, the 1s would fill the space. For instance, the 2 at column 4 would generate 1s to the right until column 9 (the next 2), filling 5-8 with 1s. Similarly, the 2 at column 9 would generate 1s to the left until column 4. This way, the area between them is filled with 1s.\n\nIn Example 2's row 7: each 2 in the row generates 1s to the left and right. But since they are contiguous, the 1s would fill the entire left side up to the start of the row, as there are no other 2s to the left. So columns 0-6 would be filled with 1s.\n\nIn Example 1's row 9: the 2 at column 9 generates 1s to the left until it hits another non-zero cell. But in the input row 9, the 2 is at column 9, and to the left are all 0s. So according to this rule, the entire row to the left of the 2 (columns 0-8) would be filled with 1s. But in the output, only columns 1-3 are filled. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, this doesn't explain Example 1's output. So perhaps this rule is incorrect.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the 2s act as boundaries, and the 1s are added in the areas enclosed by 2s. For example, in Example 0's row 8, the two groups of 2s form a sort of enclosure, and the 1s are filled in between.\n\nBut in Example 2, there's no enclosure, just a contiguous block of 2s. So why are the 1s added to the left? That's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in a pattern where each 2 in a row causes the cell three positions to the left to become 1. For Example 1's row 9, 9-3=6, but the 1s start at column 1. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of 1s added corresponds to the number of 2s in the same row. For Example 0's row 8 has four 2s. The output adds four 1s in between. But no, there are four 1s added in each of the two rows (8 and 9), but the number of 2s is four.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to see if there's a different approach. Maybe the output is the result of some image processing operation, like dilation. For example, dilating the 2s horizontally and/or vertically with 1s.\n\nIn Example 0's case, the 2s in row 8-9 are horizontally dilated to include the space between them. In Example 2, the 2s are dilated to the left, filling the entire row to the left. In Example 1, the 2s are dilated in various directions, but not sure how.\n\nDilation would mean that each 2 is replaced with a certain structure of 1s around it. For example, a horizontal dilation would add 1s to the left and right of each 2. But in Example 0, the dilation between 2s would merge them into a solid block of 1s between.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 8, the output has 1s between the two groups of 2s, which could be a horizontal dilation. In Example 2, the left side is filled with 1s, which could be a left dilation. But what's the structuring element used for dilation?\n\nAlternatively, the dilation is such that each 2 generates a horizontal line of 1s extending to the left and right until the next 2 or the edge of the grid. So in Example 0's row 8, between the two groups of 2s, the 1s are added. In Example 2, the 2s generate 1s to the left until the edge. In Example 1, the 2 at column 9 in row 9 would generate 1s to the left until another 2 is encountered. But there are no 2s to the left, so it would fill all to the left. But in Example 1's output, only columns 1-3 are filled. This inconsistency suggests that this isn't the case.\n\nHmm. Another idea: perhaps the output is created by copying the input and then, for each row, reversing it and filling with 1s up to the first 2. Then reversing back. For example, in Example 2's row 7: original row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0]. Reversed: [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Fill up to the first 2 (positions 2-4 in reversed) with 1s, then reverse back. So reversed filled part would be [1,1,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], then reversed back to [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]. That doesn't match. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, scan from left to right. When a 2 is encountered, fill all subsequent 0s with 1s until the next 2. For example:\n\nIn Example 0's row 8: after the first 2 at column 3, fill 0s with 1s until the next 2 at column 9. So columns 5-8 (since columns 3-4 are 2s) would be filled. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2's row 7: after the first 2 at column 7, fill all 0s to the right with 1s until the next 2. But there are no more 2s, so fill all 0s to the right. But the output fills to the left. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, scan from right to left. When a 2 is encountered, fill 0s to the left until another 2 is found. For Example 0's row 8: scanning from right, first 2 at column 10. Fill to the left until column 9 (another 2). Then columns 5-8 between 4 and 9. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, when a 2 is found, fill all 0s to the left until another 2 or the start of the row. Then, fill all 0s to the right until another 2 or the end of the row. But this would mean that each 2 creates a block of 1s around it, which might overlap with other 2s.\n\nIn Example 0's row 8:\n\n- The first 2 at column 3: fill left (nothing), fill right until column 4 (another 2). So no 1s here.\n\n- The next 2s are at columns 4,9,10. For column 9: fill left until column 4 (which has 2s), so fill columns 5-8. This matches the output.\n\nFor Example 2's row 7: the first 2 is at 7. Fill left until start of row (columns 0-6) with 1s. Fill right until end of row (columns 7-9 are 2s, columns 10-11 are 0s). So fill columns 10-11. But the output doesn't fill those. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example 2's output, columns 0-6 are filled. So this could explain the left part. But why not the right? Hmm.\n\nMaybe the rule is: for each 2 in a row, fill all 0s to the left of that 2 with 1s. So each 2 causes the left side to be filled. For Example 0's row 8, the 2 at column 9 would fill all 0s to the left of it (columns 0-8). But there are other 2s in between. So perhaps the left fill stops at previous 2s.\n\nAlternatively, each 2 in a row contributes to filling the area to the left of it up to the previous non-zero cell (2 or 1). So in Example 0's row 8:\n\n- The 2 at column 9 would fill from column 8 down to column 5 (since column 4 is a 2). So columns 5-8 are filled with 1s. This matches the output.\n\n- The 2 at column 10 fills columns 9 (already 2) and to the left. But since column 9 is a 2, nothing is filled.\n\n- The 2 at column 3 fills to the left (columns 0-2), but they remain 0 in the output, so this doesn't fit.\n\nBut this explains part of Example 0, but not all. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each 2 in a row, fill all 0s to the right of the previous 2 and to the left of the current 2. This way, each pair of consecutive 2s fills the space between them.\n\nFor Example 0's row 8: 2s are at 3,4,9,10. The consecutive pairs are 3 and 4 (adjacent, no space), 4 and 9 (space between), 9 and 10 (adjacent). So the space between 4 and 9 is filled with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nFor Example 2's row 7: 2s are at 7,8,9. Consecutive pairs: 7 and 8 (adjacent), 8 and 9 (adjacent). So no spaces to fill. Hence, no 1s added between them. But the output fills to the left of the first 2. So this doesn't explain that.\n\nBut according to this rule, Example 2's row 7 would have no 1s added between 2s, but the output has 1s to the left. So this rule is insufficient.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for another pattern in the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0's output, besides the horizontal fills between 2s, there are also vertical fills. For example, the 1s in rows 10 and 11, columns 7-8. How are those formed?\n\nPerhaps the vertical fills are a result of the same rule applied vertically. For example, between 2s in columns, fill vertically. But the input doesn't have vertical 2s in those positions.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical fills are a result of horizontal fills in previous rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the transformation involves both horizontal and vertical expansions of 1s from existing 1s and 2s. For example, existing 1s and 2s generate new 1s in adjacent cells, but with certain rules.\n\nFor example, in the input, existing 1s and 2s cause new 1s to be added in certain directions. For example, 2s generate 1s to the right and left, and 1s generate 1s downward. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the existing 1s are in rows 2-4. The output adds 1s in rows 8-13. How are those connected? Maybe the 1s from earlier rows propagate downward over time. But without knowing the rules, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by some sort of cellular automaton that runs for multiple generations, but the examples show the result after a certain number of steps. For example, in each step, 1s spread to adjacent cells, and 2s are fixed. But this would require knowing the number of steps, which isn't provided.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll need to make a best guess based on the examples.\n\nThe most consistent pattern I can see is that in any row that contains 2s, the 0s between the leftmost and rightmost 2 (inclusive) are replaced with 1s. Additionally, if the row has only one group of 2s, the 0s to the left of the leftmost 2 are also replaced with 1s.\n\nBut testing this:\n\nExample 0's row 8: leftmost 3, rightmost 10. Between them, replace 0s with 1s. That gives columns 5-8 as 1s. Correct.\n\nExample 2's row 7: leftmost 7, rightmost 9. Between them, no 0s. If there's only one group, fill left. So fill 0-6 with 1s. Correct.\n\nExample 1's row 9: has a single 2 at column 9. So fill left of 9 (0-8) with 1s. But the output only has 1s in 1-3. So this doesn't fit. Hence, this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nBut Example 1's output row 9 has 1s in columns 1-3, which might be due to another rule. Maybe the 1s are added only if there are 2s in certain positions in other rows. For example, the 1s in row 9, columns 1-3 could be below a 2 in row 6, column 6. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in a way that connects 2s diagonally. For example, a 2 in row X, column Y leads to 1s in row X+3, column Y-3. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that seems to work for Examples 0 and 2, and see if it can be applied to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nLooking at the test input, there are a few 2s and 1s. Let's identify rows with 2s.\n\nRow 2 has a 2 at column 12.\n\nRow 3 has a 2 at column 4.\n\nRow 8,9,10 have 2s at columns 17-19.\n\nRow 11 and 12 have 2s at columns 5-6.\n\nApplying the rule: for each row with 2s, fill between leftmost and rightmost 2s with 1s.\n\nRow 2: 2 at 12. Since it's a single 2, fill left of it. So columns 0-11 would be filled with 1s. But the input row 2 is [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 2 is at 12. So fill 0s from leftmost 2 (12) to rightmost (12), which is only column 12. So nothing to fill. But according to the previous hypothesis, if there's a single 2, fill to the left. So columns 0-11. But there's a 1 at column 2. Would that interfere?\n\nAh, the rule would be to fill 0s to the left of the leftmost 2. So in row 2, leftmost 2 is at 12. Fill all 0s to the left (columns 0-11) with 1s. But existing 1s remain. So the row would become [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut in the input, there's a 1 at column 2. The output should replace 0s with 1s, but leave existing 1s and 2s intact. So yes.\n\nRow 3: leftmost 2 is at column 4. Fill 0s to the left. But there's a 1 at column 2. So columns 0-1,3 would be filled. Wait, the row is [0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Left of the leftmost 2 (column 4) includes columns 0-3. But column 2 has a 1. So replace 0s in 0-3 except column 2. So columns 0,1,3 become 1s. So the row becomes [1,1,1,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 8,9,10: each has 2s at columns 17-19. Leftmost 17, rightmost 19. Between them, no 0s. But since it's a single group, fill to the left. So for each of these rows, columns 0-16 would be filled with 1s.\n\nRows 11 and 12 have 2s at 5-6. Leftmost 5, rightmost 6. Between them, no 0s. So fill to the left (0-4) with 1s.\n\nOther rows with no 2s remain unchanged.\n\nSo applying this rule to the test input:\n\nFor example, row 8 becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,0], but the original row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0]. So replacing columns 0-16 with 1s.\n\nSimilarly, row 11: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] becomes [1,1,1,1,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, in Example 1's row 9, there's a single 2, but the output doesn't fill all to the left. So this suggests that the rule I'm applying might not be correct. But given time constraints, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and see what the output would look like.\n\nSo the test output would have:\n\nRow 2: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,0,...]\n\nRow 3: [1,1,1,1,2,0,...]\n\nRows 8-10: filled with 1s up to column 16, followed by 2,2,2,0.\n\nRows 11-12: filled with 1s up to column 4, followed by 2,2,0,...\n\nBut wait, the test input's rows 11 and 12 have 2s at columns 5-6. So leftmost 5, fill columns 0-4 with 1s.\n\nThis would produce outputs where many rows have large blocks of 1s to the left of 2s.\n\nBut according to the training examples, when there's a single group of 2s, the output fills to the left. Example 2's row 7 has 2s starting at column 7, so filled columns 0-6. So this seems consistent.\n\nBut Example 1's row 9's output doesn't fit this pattern, which suggests that there's another rule in play. However, given time constraints and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with this pattern and see.",
