        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Looking at the training examples, the input and output grids have some changes. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, there's a 2 in the fourth row, fourth column (indexes starting from 0 maybe?). The output for that row changes a bunch of 0s to 3s and 2s. Specifically, the fourth row becomes [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, ...], which seems like the 2 is spreading left and up? Wait, but in the input, the 2 is at position (4,3) (row 4, column 3 if starting from 0), and in the output, that row has 2s from columns 0 to 3. Also, looking at the output rows below, like rows 6 and 7, they have new 3s and 2s in later columns. Maybe there's a direction here.\n\nAnother observation: the presence of a '2' in the input seems to trigger some spreading of numbers. In Example 1, the input has a 2 in row 15, column 14. The output for that area has a line of 2s and 3s extending to the right. Similarly, in Example 2, there's a 2 in the input row 4 column 5, and the output has a row filled with 2s up to that column. \n\nWait, maybe the '2' acts as a seed, and the transformation involves filling the row (or maybe column) that the 2 is in, replacing 0s with 3s except around the 2. Or perhaps the 2s and 3s are expanding in a certain direction. For instance, in Example 0's output, the 2 in the input (row 4, column 3) leads to the entire row 4 being filled with 2s from the start up to the 3, then followed by 3s. Also, the rows below that (like rows 6 and 7) have 3s extending downward and to the right with 2s. Maybe the 2 is causing a fill to the left and up, while 3s fill to the right and down?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input: there's a 2 in row 4, column 4. The output shows that the row 4 has 2 and then 3s. But also, the rows below have 2s and 3s extending into other regions. For example, rows 5 and below start having 2s in the same column, and then 3s spread out. It seems like when a 2 is present, it propagates downward, filling the column with 2s and 3s. But maybe it's more about filling in certain directions based on adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that whenever a 2 is present in the input, all the cells in the same row to the left of the 2 are replaced with 2s, and to the right with 3s. Then, the columns below the 2 are filled with 3s and 2s. Let's check Example 0: the 2 is in row 4, column 3. In the output, row 4 has 2s from 0 to 3, then a 3. So that fits. Then the columns below that 2 (columns 3 and 4) might be filled with 3s and 2s in the lower rows. For example, in row 6, columns 8 and 9 are 3 and 2. Wait, maybe it's more about the direction from the 2.\n\nAnother angle: looking for regions of 3s and 2s. Maybe the 2 is part of a structure, and the transformation involves expanding the 3s around it, possibly in a way that connects regions. For instance, in Example 0's output, the 2 is surrounded by 3s that form a sort of vertical line below it, and then a horizontal line to the left. Maybe the rule is that when a 2 is present, all 0s in the same row to the left are turned into 2s, and to the right into 3s. Then, vertically below the 2, 3s are filled. Then, for each 3 adjacent to the filled area, they expand in their direction.\n\nWait, let's take the first example again. The input has a 2 in row 4, column 3. The output's row 4 is [2,2,2,2,3, ...]. So the row to the left of the 2 (which is at column 3) becomes 2s up to that point, and then the 3 continues. Then, looking at the columns below row 4, columns 6-9 in row 5 have 3s and a 2. Then rows 6 and 7 have 3s in column 3 and 4, and then later columns 8-9 have 0s turning into 3s and 2s. Maybe the 2 in row 4 column 3 causes the entire row to fill left with 2s and right with 3s, and then the column below (column 3) gets filled with 3s, and then any adjacent 3s propagate further. But it's a bit unclear.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output: the 2 is in row 15, column 14. The output has a row 15 filled with 2s from column 14 onwards, but wait, in the input, the 2 is at column 14, row 15. The output for row 15 has 2 followed by 3s. Wait no, looking at Example 1's input: the 2 is in row 15, column 14 (the input row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 2, 0, ...]). The output for that row in Example 1 is [0,0,...,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2], which suggests that starting from the 2, the cells to the right are filled with 2s. Wait, but the output row 15 in Example 1 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]. So from column 14 (where the 2 is), it's filled to the right with 2s, but the 3s before the 2 remain. Hmm, maybe the rule is that from the 2, fill in all 0s to the right (or left?) with 2s, but the 3s are kept. Or perhaps the 2 creates a horizontal line of 2s to the right, replacing 0s but leaving existing 3s as they are. Then, vertically below that 2, the same pattern continues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s and 3s form some kind of connected region, and the transformation fills in the area around them. For example, in Example 0, the 2 is part of a group of 3s. The output fills in surrounding 0s with 3s and 2s in a way that connects to existing structures. Maybe it's a flood fill where 3s expand into 0s, but when a 2 is present, certain directions are filled with 2s instead.\n\nAnother approach: notice that in the outputs, the 2s often form vertical lines. For instance, in Example 0's output, columns 8 and 9 in rows 6-9 are 3,2,3,3, etc., forming a vertical line. Similarly, in Example 1's output, columns 13-14 have 3,2 in rows 0-3, forming vertical lines. Example 3's output has vertical lines of 2s in column 4. So maybe the rule involves creating vertical lines of 2s adjacent to 3s, or expanding existing 2s vertically.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that wherever there is a 2 in the input, all the 0s in the same column below the 2 are turned into 2s, and 0s to the right are turned into 3s. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nTake Example 0's input: the 2 is in row 4, column 3. In the output, column 3 below row 4 (rows 5,6,7, etc.) have 3s. But row 4's column 3 is 2, then in row 5, column 3 is 3. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the 2 in the input causes the entire row to be filled with 2s to the left and 3s to the right. Then, each 3 in that row then propagates downward, filling their columns with 3s until they hit a boundary. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 is at row 4, column 3. The output row 4 becomes [2,2,2,2,3,0,3,3,3,3]. So the first four elements are 2s, then a 3, then 0 (but original input here had a 3?), wait original input row 4 is [0,0,0,2,3,0,3,3,3,3]. Wait, output row 4 is [2,2,2,2,3,0,3,3,3,3]. So the 2 is in column 3, and the entire row left of it (columns 0-3) become 2s. Then, columns 4-9 remain as original (3 and others). Then, perhaps each 3 in that row (columns 4,6-9) then propagates downward. For example, column 4 in row 4 is 3, so in the output rows 5-7, column 4 is 3. Then, maybe each 3 in that row (row 4) propagates down, filling their columns with 3s where there are 0s. Similarly, the 3 in column 6 of row 4 (input has 0, but output has 3?), wait no, input row 4 has 3 in column 6. Wait, the input row 4 is [0,0,0,2,3,0,3,3,3,3]. So in output row 4, columns 0-3 are 2s, columns 4 is 3, columns 6-9 are 3s. Then, in the rows below, columns 6-9 are filled with 3s and 2s. So maybe the 3s in row 4 spread downward into 0s, and the 2s spread downward as well. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the 2 in row 4 causes the left part of the row to become 2s and the right part (from the 2's position onwards) to become 3s, but that's not exactly what's happening. For example, in Example 0's input row 4, the 2 is at column 3. The output row 4 has columns 0-3 as 2s, column 4 as 3, and the rest as original (columns 6-9 are 3s). Then, in the next rows, perhaps each 3 in that row (columns 4 and 6-9) cause their columns to be filled downward with 3s where there were 0s. So the 3 in column 4 of row 4 would fill down into rows 5-7, column 4. Similarly, the 3s in columns 6-9 would fill down into lower rows. Additionally, the 2 in row 4, column 3 might cause the column 3 to be filled downward with 3s? Because in row 5, column 3 is 3, row 6 and 7 also have 3s in column 3. So maybe when the 2 is processed, the row to the left is filled with 2s, and the same column below the 2 is filled with 3s.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern could be:\n\n1. For each row that contains a 2:\n   a. Replace all 0s to the left of the 2 (inclusive) in that row with 2s.\n   b. Replace all 0s to the right of the 2 in that row with 3s.\n   c. Then, for each cell in that row that is a 3 (original or newly placed), fill the 0s below them in the same column with 3s until another number is encountered.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's input row 4, after replacing 0s to the left of the 2 (columns 0-3) with 2s, the rest (columns 4-9) have original values. The 3 in column 4 would then propagate downward. But looking at the output, in row 5, column 4 is 3 (same as row 4), then rows 6-7 column 4 are 3s. So the 3s in the original row are causing their columns to fill downward.\n\nAdditionally, the 2's column (column 3) in row 4 is filled with 3s in the rows below. For example, row 5 column 3 is 3, row 6 column 3 is 3, etc. So perhaps the 2's column is filled with 3s downward, starting from the 2's position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of a 2 in a row triggers two things: \n- All 0s to the left in that row become 2s.\n- All 0s in the same column below the 2 become 3s.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the column below the 2 (column 3) has 3s in rows 5,6,7. So that fits. Then, for any 3s in the modified row (row 4), their columns are filled downward with 3s until a non-zero is hit. For example, column 4 in row 4 is 3. The rows below (5-7) in column 4 are 3s. Then, row 5 has 3s in columns 6-9, which then propagate downward as well.\n\nAnother test case: in Example 1's input, the 2 is in row 15, column 14. The output for that row (row 15) is [0,...,3,3,2,2,2,...]. So the 0s to the right of the 2 are replaced with 2s. Then, the column below (columns 14) in rows 16-19 would be filled with 3s. But in the output, row 15's column 14 is 2, and the rows below that column have 3s. For example, in rows 16-19, column 14 is part of the filled 3s. Wait, in the output of Example 1, rows 13-16 in column 14 have 3,3,2,3. Hmm, maybe the 2's column is filled downward with 3s until another 2 is encountered.\n\nAlternatively, the 2's column is filled with 3s downward, but only if the original cell was 0. So in the input, wherever there's a 2 in a cell, all the 0s below it in the same column are turned into 3s. And in the same row, the 0s to the left of the 2 are turned into 2s, and to the right into 3s. But perhaps it's the other way around.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input: the 2 is in row 14, column 10. The output for that row (row 14) is [2,2,...2,3,3,3,3,0...]. So the 0s to the left of the 2 are filled with 2s, and to the right with 3s. Then, the column below (column 10) in rows 15-19 would be filled with 3s. But in the output, row 15 column 10 is 3, and rows 16-19 column 10 are 3s as well. So that fits.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\nFor each cell in the input that is a 2:\n1. In its row, replace all 0s to the left (including the 2's position) with 2s.\n2. Replace all 0s to the right of the 2 in the same row with 3s.\n3. Then, in the column of the 2, replace all 0s below the 2 with 3s.\n\nAdditionally, for any 3s that are present in the modified row (after step 1 and 2), their columns are filled downward with 3s where there are 0s. But maybe that's part of another rule.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, after modifying row 4, the 3s in that row (columns 4,6,7,8,9) have their columns filled downward. For example, column 4 has 3s in rows 4-7. Similarly, columns 6-9 have 3s filled downward. So perhaps after the initial transformation of the row with the 2, any 3s in that row (including the original and those added in step 2) cause their columns to be filled downward with 3s, replacing 0s until a non-zero is encountered.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For each row containing a 2:\n   a. Replace all 0s to the left of the 2 (inclusive) in that row with 2s.\n   b. Replace all 0s to the right of the 2 in that row with 3s.\n   c. For each cell in the row that is a 3 (either original or added), fill the 0s in the same column below with 3s until a non-zero is hit.\n\nBut how about multiple 2s? For example, if a row has multiple 2s, but the examples don't show that. So perhaps each row is processed once, and the leftmost 2 is considered? Or all 2s are processed, but in the given examples, each row with a 2 has only one.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nThe test input has a 2 in row 5, column 4 (assuming rows start at 0). Let's look at the test input rows:\n\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFollowing the steps:\n\nStep 1a: Replace 0s to the left of the 2 (columns 0-3 and column 4 (the 2 itself) with 2s. So columns 0-4 become 2s. But in the input row 5, columns 0-3 are 0s, column 4 is 2. So after step 1a, columns 0-4 would be 2s. Then step 1b: replace 0s to the right of the 2 with 3s. The 0 in column 7 (since row 5 is [0,0,0,0,2,3,3,0, ...]). So columns 7 and beyond would have 0s turned into 3s. Wait, but the input row 5 after step 1a would be [2,2,2,2,2,3,3,0,0,0,...]. Then step 1b: replace 0s to the right of the 2 (which is in column 4). So any 0s in columns 5 and beyond? Wait, in the input row 5, after step 1a, columns 0-4 are 2s, columns 5-6 are 3,3. Columns 7-19 are 0s. So step 1b would replace those 0s (columns 7-19) with 3s. So row 5 becomes [2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,...].\n\nThen step 1c: for each 3 in this row (columns 5,6,7-19), fill their columns downward with 3s. So columns 5-19 in the rows below row 5 (rows 6-19) where there are 0s would become 3s. But looking at the test input, rows 6-9 in column 4 are 3,3,3,3. So after processing, columns 5 and beyond would fill downward.\n\nBut the test input's lower part (rows 14-19) have some 3s and a 2. Let's see:\n\nThe test input's rows 14-19 are:\n\nRow 14: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\nRow 15: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\nAnd so on. So in row 14, there's a 2 in column 13. So this would trigger another transformation for row 14.\n\nSo applying the same steps to row 14:\n\nRow 14's input has a 2 in column 13. So step 1a: replace 0s to the left (columns 0-13) with 2s. But row 14 in the input has 0s from 0-6 and 7-12 are 3s, column 13 is 2. So replacing 0s in columns 0-6 with 2s. Then columns 7-13 are 3s except column 13 is 2. Wait, the input row 14 is:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nSo step 1a: replace columns 0-6 (since the 2 is at column 13) with 2s. So columns 0-6 become 2s, columns 7-13: columns 7-12 are 3s, column 13 is 2. Then step 1b: replace 0s to the right of the 2 (columns 14-19) with 3s. But columns 14-19 in row 14 are already 3s except column 13 is 2. Wait, the original row 14 after step 1a would have columns 0-6 as 2s, columns 7-12 as 3s, column 13 as 2, and columns 14-19 as 3s. So there are no 0s to the right of the 2. So step 1b does nothing here. Then step 1c: for each 3 in the row (columns 7-12 and 14-19), their columns are filled downward with 3s. But rows below row 14 (rows 15-19) in those columns already have 3s, so nothing changes. However, column 13 (the 2's column) would have its 0s below replaced with 3s. But looking at the input, rows 15-19 in column 13 are already 3s. So this might not change anything.\n\nBut in the test input, after processing row 5 and row 14, the output would have:\n\n- Row 5: all 2s up to column 4, then 3s from column 5 onward. Then, columns 5-19 in rows below 5 are filled with 3s where there were 0s. So rows 6-13, columns 5-19 would be filled with 3s. But the original input's rows 6-13 in columns 5-19 are mostly 0s. So these would become 3s. However, row 14 has a 2 in column 13, so when processing row 14, columns 0-6 would be filled with 2s, and the rest are 3s. Then, columns 7-19 are filled with 3s downward. But since the rows below row 14 already have 3s, that's already done.\n\nPutting it all together, the test input's output would have:\n\nRow 5: [2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nThen, rows 6-13 in columns 5-19 are filled with 3s. For example, row 6, which was [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,...], after processing, columns 5-19 are filled with 3s. So row 6 becomes [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,...3].\n\nAdditionally, row 14's processing would turn columns 0-6 into 2s, and the rest remain as 3s, and columns 7-19 filled downward (but those are already filled). So row 14's output would start with 2s in columns 0-6, then 3s up to column 13 (with a 2), then 3s onwards. But since the original row 14 has a 2 in column 13, the processing would make columns 0-13 (left of 2) into 2s up to the 2's position. Wait, no. The processing for row 14's 2 is:\n\nStep 1a: replace 0s to the left of the 2 (columns 0-13) with 2s. But the original row 14 has 0s in columns 0-6, and 3s in columns 7-12, and a 2 in column 13. So after step 1a, columns 0-6 become 2s, columns 7-12 remain 3s, column 13 is 2. Then step 1b: replace 0s to the right of the 2 (columns 14-19) with 3s. But those columns already have 3s. So row 14 becomes [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nThen, step 1c: for each 3 in row 14 (columns 7-12 and 14-19), fill their columns downward with 3s. But rows below row 14 (15-19) in those columns already have 3s, so no change.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nRow 0-4: unchanged except for row 5.\n\nRow 5: filled with 2s left of the 2 and 3s to the right.\n\nRows 6-13: columns 5-19 filled with 3s where there were 0s.\n\nRow 14: as processed above.\n\nRows 15-19: as per the input, but with their columns filled based on row 14's processing.\n\nBut the test input's rows 15-19 are:\n\nRow15: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow16: same as 15.\n\nRow17: same.\n\nRow18: same.\n\nRow19: same.\n\nSo after processing row 5's 2, rows 6-13 columns 5-19 would be filled with 3s. Let's see:\n\nRow6: originally [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. After step 1c from row5's processing, columns 5-19 are filled with 3s. So row6 becomes [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] but wait, no. Because the original row6 has 3s in columns 4-6 (indices 4,5,6). The processing from row5's step 1c would replace 0s in columns 5-19 in rows6-13 with 3s. So row6's columns 7-19 (which were 0s) become 3s. So row6 becomes [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but wait, the original row6's column7 is 0. After processing, columns5 and beyond (from row5's step 1b and 1c) would have their 0s filled with 3s. So row6's columns5-19 become 3s, except where there were non-zero values. For example, columns4 is 3, columns5-6 are 3, so they remain. Columns7-19 were 0s, so become 3s. But the original row6's columns4 is 3, columns5-6 are 3, columns7-19 are 0s. So after processing, columns5-19 are filled with 3s, making row6's output:\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nSimilarly, rows7-13 would have their columns5-19 filled with 3s. \n\nThen, processing row14's 2 would modify row14 as [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3]. Then, columns7-12 and 14-19 would have their columns filled downward. But rows15-19 in these columns are already 3s, so no change.\n\nThe test output would then look like:\n\nFor rows 0-4: same as input.\n\nRow5: [2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRows6-13: each of these rows has columns5-19 filled with 3s. So for example, row6 becomes [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3], but the original row6's column4 is 3, which remains. \n\nRow14: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRows15-19: unchanged except columns7-19 are 3s (but they already were in the input). However, row14's processing would lead to columns7-12 and 14-19 being filled with 3s downward. But since rows15-19 already have 3s, no change.\n\nWait, but row14's processing may also affect rows15-19. For example, columns7-12 in row14 are 3s, so their columns below would be filled with 3s. But rows15-19 in those columns already have 3s, so nothing changes. Similarly, columns14-19 in row14 are 3s, but rows15-19 already have 3s there.\n\nSo the final output would have:\n\nRow5: filled with 2s up to column4, then 3s.\n\nRows6-13: columns5-19 filled with 3s.\n\nRow14: filled with 2s up to column6, then 3s except column13 is 2.\n\nRows15-19: same as input but columns5-19 filled with 3s (from row5's processing). However, in the input, rows15-19 in columns5-19 already have 3s except row14. So no change.\n\nBut looking at the test input's row14, after processing, column13 is 2. Then, according to the pattern, the column below (rows15-19) in column13 would be filled with 3s. The input's rows15-19 in column13 are 3s (rows15: column13 is 3, row14's column13 is 2, rows15-19 column13 is 3). So in row14's processing, column13 is 2, so the 0s below it would be filled with 3s. But in the input, rows15-19 in column13 are already 3s, so no change.\n\nPutting all together, the test output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: same as row0.\nRow2: same.\nRow3: same.\nRow4: same.\nRow5: [2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow7: same as row6.\nRow8: same.\nRow9: same.\nRow10: same.\nRow11: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (but after processing, columns5-19 filled with 3s. Wait, row11's input is all 0s except columns7-10. So after processing, row11's columns5-19 would become 3s. But original row11 is [0,...,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So row11 becomes [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]. But in the input, row11 is all zeros except for columns7-19, but after processing row5's 2, all columns5-19 in rows6-13 are filled with 3s. So row11 (which is in rows6-13) would have columns5-19 filled with 3s.\n\nSimilarly, row14's output is [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRows15-19: their columns5-19 would have 3s, but in the input they already have 3s, so they remain the same.\n\nSo the final output for the test input would have:\n\nRows0-4: same as input except row5.\n\nRow5: filled with 2s up to column4, then 3s.\n\nRows6-13: columns5-19 filled with 3s.\n\nRow14: modified as per the 2 in column13.\n\nRows15-19: same as input, but columns5-19 are filled with 3s. Wait, no: rows15-19's columns5-19 are already 3s in the input, so they stay the same.\n\nBut looking at the test input's rows15-19:\n\nRow15: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nSo after processing, columns5-19 are filled with 3s. But columns5-6 were 0s. So row15's columns5-6 become 3s. But in the input, row15's columns7-19 are already 3s, but columns5-6 are 0s. So after processing, row15 becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nBut the original row15's columns5-6 are 0s. So after processing, those are filled with 3s.\n\nBut the initial processing from row5's step 1c would fill columns5-19 in rows6-13 with 3s. Row15 is beyond row13, so it's not filled by row5's processing. However, row14's processing would fill columns7-12 and 14-19 with 3s downward, but rows15-19 already have 3s. So row15's columns5-6 would remain 0s unless another 2 in row15 is present. But in the test input, row15 has no 2. So this part is unclear. \n\nWait, no: row5's processing (the 2 in row5, column4) causes columns5-19 in rows6-13 to be filled with 3s. Rows14-19 are not part of that range, so their columns5-19 remain as in the input unless modified by other 2s. But row14's processing (due to the 2 in row14, column13) modifies its own row, and any columns below it would have their 0s filled. But row14 is the last row with a 2, and rows15-19 are processed based on row14's 3s. So columns7-12 and 14-19 in row14 are 3s, so their columns below (rows15-19) are filled with 3s. But in the input, those columns already have 3s. So no change.\n\nBut row15's columns5-6 are 0s. They are not affected by any processing from row5's or row14's steps. So in the output, they remain 0s. Unless there's another rule I'm missing.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to re-express the pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: Each time a 2 is encountered, the row is processed as left 2s and right 3s, then each 3 in that row propagates downward. But in the test input's row5, after processing, columns5-19 are 3s, and the 3s in those columns propagate downward to rows6-19. So any 0s in those columns below row5 would be filled with 3s. For example, row6's columns5-19 are filled with 3s. Then row7's columns5-19 are filled, and so on down to row19. So even rows14 and below would have their columns5-19 filled with 3s if they were 0s. \n\nSo in the test input's row15, columns5-6 are 0s. These are in columns5-19, so after processing row5's 2, they would be filled with 3s. Because the propagation from row5's 3s is for all rows below. So row6-19's columns5-19 are filled with 3s where there were 0s.\n\nThus, in row15, columns5-6 would be 3s in the output. Similarly, row15's columns5-6 are 0s in the input, so they become 3s. So row15 becomes [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nBut the original row15's columns7-19 are already 3s, so no change there.\n\nSo the final output for the test input would have rows6-19's columns5-19 filled with 3s where there were 0s. \n\nPutting this all together, the test output would look like:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: same as row0.\nRow2: same.\nRow3: same.\nRow4: same.\nRow5: [2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow7: same as row6.\nRow8: same.\nRow9: same.\nRow10: same.\nRow11: same.\nRow12: [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow13: same.\nRow14: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow15: [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow16: same as row15.\nRow17: same.\nRow18: same.\nRow19: same.\n\nThis matches the pattern seen in the training examples where 2s trigger left fills and right fills with 3s in their row, and the 3s propagate downward.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern between the input and output in the training examples to solve the test input. Let me start by looking at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0: The input has a structure where there are some 3s and a 2. The output seems to add more 3s and 2s around those positions. For instance, the row with the 2 (row 4) in the input becomes [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, ...]. Also, rows above and below that row get filled with 3s. Maybe there's a spreading or filling effect starting from the 2 and 3s?\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a vertical line of 3s and a 2. The output shows that the 2 is surrounded by 2s in a row (like a horizontal line) and the 3s spread out in rows below. Also, in the output, the 2 seems to create a horizontal line of 2s, and the 3s fill in the areas around them. So perhaps whenever there's a 2, it propagates to the left (or right) in its row, replacing 3s with 2s, and 3s spread upwards or downwards?\n\nExample 2: The input has a group of 3s and a 2. The output shows that rows below the 2 are filled with 2s in a horizontal line, and the 3s above are filled out. It looks like the 2 acts as a seed, and the 3s expand in certain directions. Maybe the 2 causes a horizontal spread of 2s in its row, and the 3s spread vertically upwards and downwards from their original positions.\n\nExample 3: The input has a 2 in the middle of 3s. The output shows that the 2's row and the rows below it have 2s spreading to the right, and the 3s fill in the adjacent areas. Also, there's a vertical expansion of 3s from the original positions.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern seems to involve two main elements:\n\n1. When there's a 2 in a row, it propagates left or right in its row, replacing 3s with 2s, creating a horizontal line of 2s.\n2. The 3s expand vertically upwards and downwards from their original positions, filling in adjacent zeros. However, when a 2 is present, it might influence the direction or limit the expansion of 3s.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input's row 4 (index 4) has a 2. The output for that row is [2,2,2,2,3,...], so all the 3s to the left of the 2 are replaced with 2s. Then the rows below (like row 5) have 3s, but in rows 6 and 7, there's a vertical expansion of 3s downward. Similarly, in Example 1, the 2 in row 15 (input) leads to a horizontal line of 2s in the output row 15, and the 3s above and below expand into zeros.\n\nAnother observation: the 2 seems to create a horizontal line of 2s in its row, starting from the 2's position and extending leftward, replacing any 3s with 2s. Then, the 3s in the same column as the original 3s expand upward and downward, but maybe only if there's a 2 below them? Or perhaps the 3s expand as long as there's a 3 below them, creating vertical lines.\n\nWait, maybe the 3s form vertical columns, and the 2s form horizontal lines. The transformation could be that each 3 in the input starts a vertical column of 3s upwards and downwards, filling zeros until they hit a non-zero. Similarly, each 2 starts a horizontal line to the left and right, replacing 3s with 2s, but only within its row. So the process is:\n\n- For each 3 in the input, fill vertically (up and down) with 3s until blocked.\n- For each 2 in the input, fill horizontally (left and right) with 2s in the same row, replacing 3s.\n\nBut looking at the examples, in Example 0's input, the 2 is at position (4,3) (row 4, column 3). The output row 4 becomes [2,2,2,2,3, ...]. So starting from the 2, it fills left, converting 3s to 2s. The original 3s to the right of the 2 remain as 3s. Then, the vertical expansion of 3s occurs in other rows. So maybe the 2's horizontal expansion only affects the row it's in, and the 3s expand vertically.\n\nBut how do the 3s expand? In Example 0, the input has a group of 3s in rows 2-3 and 6-7. The output shows that those 3s expand into adjacent rows. For example, in row 3, the input is [0,0,0,3,3,0...], and the output is [3,3,3,3,3,0...]. So the 3s in row 3 expanded to the left. But in row 4, the 3s are converted to 2s except the one after the 2. Then rows 6 and 7 have 3s expanding downward into rows 8 and 9. So maybe the 3s expand both up and down, but when they hit a 2's horizontal line, they stop or are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s expand vertically (up and down) as far as possible, filling zeros, but if they encounter a 2 in their path, the 2's horizontal line takes precedence. So the process is:\n\n1. For each cell in the input:\n   a. If it's a 3, propagate 3s upwards and downwards in its column until a non-zero (other than 3) is encountered.\n   b. If it's a 2, propagate 2s left and right in its row, replacing 3s with 2s.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the output row 4 (input has a 2 in column 3 of row 4) becomes [2,2,2,2,3,0,3,3,3,3]. So the 2 is at column 3 (index starting from 0?), and the row becomes 2s from column 0 to 3, then 3 in column 4. The original input row 4 has 2 at column 3. So in the output, the 2's row has 2s to the left of the original 2's position, but the 3s to the right remain. Wait, original row 4 in input is [0,0,0,2,3,0,3,3,3,3]. The output row 4 is [2,2,2,2,3,0,3,3,3,3]. So the 2 is in position 3, and the propagation to the left converts the zeros (or maybe replaces existing 3s) to 2s. Wait, the original positions to the left of the 2 in that row are zeros. So how did they become 2s? That suggests that maybe the 2's propagation is not just replacing 3s but also filling zeros. But that's conflicting with the initial thought.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a 2 is present in a row, it creates a horizontal line to the left until the start of the row, filling with 2s. But in Example 0's output row 4, the 2s start from column 0 to 3, which were zeros in the input. So maybe the 2's expansion is to the left, filling all zeros and replacing any 3s with 2s. Similarly, in Example 1's output, the row with the 2 (row 15) has a horizontal line of 2s to the left, but the input had a 2 at column 14 (assuming zero-based). The output row 15 is [0,0,...,2,2,2,...], so the 2s spread left.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\n- For every 2 in the input, in its row, fill all cells to the left (from the 2's position towards the start) with 2s, replacing any existing 3s or zeros.\n\n- For every 3 in the input, in its column, fill all cells above and below with 3s, but only if they are zeros. However, if during this expansion, a 2 is encountered (from another row's horizontal spread), the 2 takes precedence.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's row 4, the 2's row has 2s to the left (original zeros), and the 3 in column 4 remains. So the 2's expansion to the left fills all cells to the left with 2s, regardless of their original value. Then, the 3's vertical expansion would fill their columns with 3s, but if a cell is already filled by a 2 (from a horizontal spread), it remains 2. So the priority is 2s over 3s.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Process all 2s first: for each 2, spread left in the same row, filling all cells to the left (including the original position) with 2s.\n\n2. Then process all 3s: for each 3, spread up and down in the same column, filling cells with 3s only if they are 0.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's output, the 3s in row 3 (input row 3) spread upwards. Let's see:\n\nInput row 3: [0,0,0,3,3,0...]\nOutput row 3: [3,3,3,3,3,0...]\n\nSo the 3s in columns 3 and 4 in row 3 (input) spread to the left in their row. Wait, but according to the vertical spreading idea, that's a horizontal spread. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s spread both vertically and horizontally. But how? Looking at Example 0's output, the 3s in row 3 and 4 are part of a larger block. Maybe each 3 in the input causes a horizontal spread in their row, but also vertical spread. But how does that work with 2s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s spread both left and right in their row and up and down in their column, but are blocked by non-3s. But then, when a 2 is present in the row, it overwrites the 3s.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to model the steps for Example 0.\n\nOriginal input for Example 0:\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,3,3,0...]\nRow 3: [0,0,0,3,3,0...]\nRow 4: [0,0,0,2,3,0...]\nRow 5: [0,0,0,3,3,0...]\nRow 6: [0,0,0,3,3,0...]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow 2 remains the same.\nRow 3 becomes [3,3,3,3,3,0...] \u2014 so the 3s spread left.\nRow 4 becomes [2,2,2,2,3,0...] \u2014 the 2 spreads left, converting the left cells (which were 0s) to 2s.\nRow 5 becomes [3,3,3,3,3,0...] \u2014 the 3s spread left.\nRows 6 and 7 become [0,0,0,3,3,0...] in input, but in output, rows 6 and 7 have 3s spreading downward. Wait, output rows 6 and 7 are:\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,2,3]\nRow 7: [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,2,3]\n\nBut in the input, rows 6 and 7 have 3s in columns 3-4. In the output, those 3s are now spreading to the right (columns 7-9) in those rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s spread in all directions (left, right, up, down) as long as they encounter zeros. But when a 2 is present in the same row, the 2's spread takes precedence in that row.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output row 4, the 2s have spread left, but the 3 in column 4 remains. Then, in row 5, the 3s spread left. So maybe the 3s spread left and right in their own rows, but in rows where a 2 is present, the 2's left spread overwrites the left part of the row.\n\nBut in that case, for each 3 in a row, spread left and right to fill with 3s, but if a 2 is present in the same row, the 2's left spread happens first, and then the 3s spread to the right of the 2.\n\nWait, in row 4 of Example 0's input, the 2 is at column 3, and the 3 is at column 4. The output row 4 has [2,2,2,2,3,0,3,3,3,3]. So the 2s filled left from column 3 to 0, and the 3s filled right from column 4 onwards. So perhaps the 2's spread is left in their row, and then the 3s spread right in their row, and also up and down.\n\nBut how do the vertical spreads work? For example, in Example 0's output, rows 8 and 9 have 3s in columns 7-9, which weren't present in the input. How did those appear?\n\nLooking at the input for Example 0, in row 5 (input), there are 3s starting from column 6 (values 3,3,3,3). The output for row 5 is [3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,2,3]. Wait, the input row 5 has 3s in columns 6-9. In the output, those 3s spread left to column 0 (since row 5's output starts with 3s). But the row 5's input also has a 2 in column 8. Wait, input row 5 is [0,0,0,3,3,0,3,3,2,3]. The 2 is in column 8. In the output row 5, it's [3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,2,3]. So the 2's left spread in row 5 would be from column 8 leftwards. But the output shows that the left part of row 5 is filled with 3s. So maybe the 3s spread left first, then the 2s spread left in their row, but in row 5, the 2 is in column 8. So the output row 5's left part is filled with 3s (from spreading left from columns 3 and 4?), then the 2 in column 8 spreads left, replacing 3s with 2s. But the output row 5's columns 0-3 are 3s, columns 4-5 are 3 and 0, then columns 6-7 are 3s, column 8 is 2, column 9 is 3. So perhaps the 3s spread left from their original positions, and the 2 in column 8 spreads left but only affects the part of the row to the left of it. But how?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to see a general pattern.\n\nThe main transformations observed:\n\n- The presence of a 2 in a row leads to a horizontal line of 2s extending to the left from the 2's original position.\n\n- The presence of a 3 leads to horizontal spreading (left and right) in the same row and vertical spreading (up and down) in the same column, filling zeros with 3s.\n\nBut how do the 2s and 3s interact?\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 in row 4, column 3, leads to 2s to the left (columns 0-3). The 3s in row 4, column 4, then spread to the right, and maybe vertically. The 3s in row 5, column 8's 2 is in the same row. The output for row 5 shows that the 3s spread left (columns 0-4) but the 2 in column 8 only affects its own position and perhaps left in that row. But in the output, the 2 is only in column 8, not spreading left. Wait, in Example 0's input row 5, there's a 2 at column 8. In the output row 5, columns 0-3 are 3s, columns 4-7 are 3s, then column 8 is 2, column 9 is 3. So the 2 in column 8 didn't spread left. Hmm, that's inconsistent with the earlier idea. So maybe the 2s only spread left in their row if they are in certain positions? Or maybe there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s spread left only in their own contiguous block. For example, if there's a 2 followed by 3s, the 2 converts the 3s to the left of it. But in Example 0's row 5, the 2 is after some 3s. Wait, input row 5 is [0,0,0,3,3,0,3,3,2,3]. The 2 is at column 8. In the output row 5, it's [3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,2,3]. So the 2 didn't spread left here. So why in row 4, the 2 spreads left, but in row 5, it doesn't? Because in row 4, the 2 is preceded by zeros, and in row 5, the 2 is preceded by 3s. So maybe the 2's spread to the left only converts zeros and 3s to 2s. But in row 5, the 2 is at column 8. To the left of it are 3s (columns 6 and 7) and zeros. So why didn't those 3s get converted to 2s?\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my initial hypothesis is incorrect. Let me re-examine Example 0.\n\nInput row 4: [0,0,0,2,3,0,3,3,3,3]\nOutput row 4: [2,2,2,2,3,0,3,3,3,3]\n\nAh, so in this row, the 2 is at column 3. The output converts all cells from column 0 to 3 to 2s. The 3 at column 4 remains. So the 2 spreads left, converting all cells (including zeros) to 2s up to column 0. Then, the 3s to the right of the 2 (columns 4 and beyond) are left as 3s. But why in this case, the 2 spreads left, but in row 5, the 2 at column 8 doesn't spread left?\n\nLooking at the input row 5: [0,0,0,3,3,0,3,3,2,3]\nOutput row 5: [3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,2,3]\n\nThe 2 is at column 8. In the output, columns 0-3 are 3s (from the original 3s in columns 3 and 4 spreading left?), columns 6-7 are 3s (original 3s there), column 8 is 2, column 9 is 3. So the 2 in column 8 didn't spread left. But why? Because maybe the 2 only spreads left if there are 3s or zeros to the left. In this case, the left of the 2 is a 3 (column 7) and another 3 (column 6). But in the output, those remain 3s. So the 2 didn't convert them. So maybe the rule is that a 2 only spreads left through zeros, not 3s. But in Example 0's row 4, the 2 spreads left through zeros and converts them to 2s, but in row 5, the 2 is to the right of 3s, so it doesn't spread left through them.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the 2 spreads left through zeros, converting them to 2s, but stops when it encounters a non-zero (like a 3). So in row 4, the 2 is at column 3, and to the left are zeros, so they become 2s. To the right of the 2 is a 3 (column 4), which remains. In row 5, the 2 is at column 8, and to the left are 3s (columns 6 and 7) and a zero (column 5). Wait, the input row 5 is [0,0,0,3,3,0,3,3,2,3]. So columns 0-2 are 0s, 3-4 are 3s, 5 is 0, 6-7 are 3s, 8 is 2, 9 is 3. So the 2 at column 8 has to the left column 7 (3), column 6 (3), column 5 (0). So according to the rule, the 2 would spread left through zeros (column 5) but stop at column 6 (3). But in the output row 5, columns 5 is 0. So maybe the 2 only spreads left through consecutive zeros. Let's see: in row 5's input, the 2 is at column 8. To the left is column 7 (3), so it can't spread past that. So the 2 remains only in column 8. But why in Example 0's row 4, the 2 can spread left through zeros, converting them to 2s, but in row 5, the 2's left is blocked by 3s. So the 2's left spread is only possible through zeros, and stops when it hits a non-zero (3 or another number). So the rule for 2s is: in their row, spread leftwards, converting all consecutive zeros to 2s until a non-zero is encountered.\n\nThen, for 3s, the rule is: in their row, spread left and right through zeros, converting them to 3s. And in their column, spread up and down through zeros, converting to 3s. But if during this spreading, they encounter a 2 (from a previous step), the 3s are overwritten by 2s. Wait, but how are the steps ordered?\n\nMaybe the order is:\n\n1. Process all 2s first: for each 2 in the input, spread left in the same row, converting zeros to 2s until a non-zero is encountered.\n\n2. Then process all 3s: for each 3 in the input (original, not the ones added by spreading), spread left and right in the row, converting zeros to 3s, and spread up and down in the column, converting zeros to 3s.\n\nThis way, the 2s' left spread happens first, and then the 3s spread, but they can't overwrite the 2s since the 2s were processed first.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 4 has a 2 at column 3. Processing 2s first:\n\n- For row 4, column 3 (2), spread left converting zeros to 2s. The cells to the left (columns 0-2) are zeros. So columns 0-3 become 2s. The cell at column 4 is 3, so it remains. The result is [2,2,2,2,3,0,3,3,3,3].\n\nThen, process the 3s. For each original 3 in the input, spread left, right, up, and down.\n\nFor example, the original 3s in row 2, columns 3 and 4. \n\nSpreading left in row 2: columns 0-2 are zeros. So they become 3s. So row 2 becomes [3,3,3,3,3,0,...].\n\nSpreading up and down for these 3s: \n\n- Up: row 1, column 3 and 4. Original zeros, so set to 3.\n\nBut looking at the output, row 2 becomes [3,3,3,3,3,0...], and row 3 becomes [3,3,3,3,3,0...]. So maybe the vertical spread of 3s from row 3's original 3s (columns 3 and 4) also contributes.\n\nThis could get complicated, but the key idea is that after processing 2s, the 3s spread in all directions, filling zeros with 3s.\n\nNow, looking at row 5's input, which has 3s in columns 3,4,6,7, and a 2 in column 8. After processing the 2 in column 8, since there are zeros to the left (column 5) but the 3s in columns 6 and 7 block the spread. So the 2 would only convert column 5 (if it's zero) and stop at column 6 (3). Wait, the input row 5 has column 5 as 0. So during 2 processing, the 2 in column 8 would spread left through column 5 (zero), converting it to 2, then hit column 6 (3) and stop. So the 2 would be in columns 5-8. But the output row 5 is [3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,2,3]. So columns 5 remains 0. That contradicts this hypothesis.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the initial hypothesis is incorrect. Let's think again.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the 3s spread first, and then the 2s overwrite some of them. But that doesn't fit with Example 0's row 4, where the 2's spread comes before the 3s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the processing is done in multiple passes. For example:\n\n- First, spread 3s in all directions, filling zeros.\n\n- Then, spread 2s left, overwriting any cells (including 3s) to the left.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 4, after spreading 3s, the row would have 3s from columns 3-4 and 6-9. Then the 2 spreads left, converting the 3s to the left (columns 0-3) to 2s. But in the output, columns 0-3 are 2s, and columns 4 is a 3. So that would make sense.\n\nBut how does the spreading work for 3s? Maybe the 3s spread in all directions (left, right, up, down) as much as possible, and then the 2s spread left, overwriting any 3s to the left of them.\n\nLet me re-express the steps:\n\n1. Expand all 3s:\n\n   For each cell in the input that is a 3, expand in all directions (left, right, up, down), turning all connected zeros into 3s. This is similar to a flood fill.\n\n   So any zero adjacent to a 3 (including diagonally?) or connected through zeros would become 3. Wait, but looking at Example 0's output, the 3s in row 3 expand left to fill columns 0-4. That suggests that the expansion is left and right in the row, and up and down in the column. But perhaps it's more like horizontal and vertical expansion.\n\n   For example, if a 3 is present in a row, all zeros to the left and right in that row become 3s. Similarly, all zeros above and below in that column become 3s. But this needs to be done for all 3s in the input.\n\n   But in Example 0's output, row 3 has 3s from column 0-4. The original 3s are in columns 3-4. So expanding left in the row fills columns 0-2 with 3s. Then, expanding up and down in their columns. For example, column 3's 3s expand up to row 1 and down to row 7.\n\n   But in the output, row 3's columns 0-4 are 3s, and rows 4-7 in column 3 are 3s. This seems like the 3s are expanding left in their row and down in their column.\n\n2. Expand all 2s:\n\n   For each 2 in the input, expand left in their row, turning all cells (including 3s and zeros) to 2s until the start of the row. So a 2 converts all cells to its left to 2s, regardless of their original value.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 5, the 2 is at column 8. If we first expand 3s, then expand 2s:\n\n- After 3s expansion, row 5's columns 3-4 and 6-9 are 3s (since the original 3s in columns 3,4,6,7,9 are in the input). So during 3s expansion, the 3s spread left and right in their row, and up and down in their columns. For example, columns 3 and 4's 3s spread left in row 5 to columns 0-2 and 5 (but column 5 is zero, so it becomes 3). Columns 6-7's 3s spread to column 5 and 8-9. Then, the 2 in column 8 would spread left, converting columns 0-8 to 2s. But in the output row 5, columns 0-3 are 3s, which contradicts this.\n\nSo this approach doesn't fit. Maybe the expansion of 2s and 3s happens in a different order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s and 2s are processed in a way that 2s have priority. For example:\n\n- Process 2s first, expanding left, converting all to 2s.\n\n- Then process 3s, expanding in all directions, but only filling zeros.\n\nSo in Example 0's row 4, the 2 spreads left, converting columns 0-3 to 2s. Then, the 3s in column 4 expand right and up/down. The 3s in column 4 of row 4 would expand to the right (columns 5-9 are zeros?), but in the output, row 4 has 3 in column 4 and then 0 in column 5. Wait, maybe the 3s can't expand right past a zero if there's a 2 in the row.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In the outputs, the 2s form horizontal lines to the left of their original position. The 3s form vertical and horizontal blocks. For example, in Example 0's output, rows 3 and 4 have 3s spreading left, and rows 6-9 have 3s spreading downward. The 2 in row 4 creates a horizontal line of 2s to the left.\n\nSo maybe the rule is:\n\n- For each row, if there's a 2, fill all cells to the left of it (including the cell itself) with 2s.\n\n- For each column, if there's a 3, fill all cells above and below with 3s.\n\nBut how does this account for the horizontal spread of 3s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each row, after handling the 2s, the 3s fill the rest of the row to the left and right.\n\nWait, let's think of each row independently:\n\n- For each row, process the cells from right to left.\n\n   a. If a cell is a 2, set all cells to the left of it (including itself) to 2.\n\n   b. If a cell is a 3, set all cells to the left and right of it to 3, but only if they are zeros.\n\nBut this doesn't explain the vertical spread. \n\nAlternatively, the vertical spread is handled by columns:\n\n- For each column, process from bottom to top or top to bottom:\n\n   a. If a cell is a 3, set all cells above and below to 3, if they are zeros.\n\nBut how do these two steps interact?\n\nThis is challenging. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe 2 in row 4, column 3, causes the entire left part of the row to be 2s. The 3 in column 4 remains. Then, the 3s in column 4 spread upward and downward. For example, row 3, column 4 is 3, so rows above and below in column 4 get 3s. But row 3's columns 0-3 are also 3s. So maybe the 3s spread both horizontally and vertically.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s form a cross shape: they spread horizontally in their row and vertically in their column. But the 2s cut the horizontal spread to the left.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\n1. For each 2 in the input, in its row, set all cells to the left (including itself) to 2.\n\n2. For each 3 in the input:\n\n   a. Spread horizontally in its row, setting all cells to the left and right to 3, but stop if a non-zero is encountered (except other 3s?).\n\n   b. Spread vertically in its column, setting all cells above and below to 3, stop if a non-zero is encountered.\n\nBut how do these steps interact? For example, after the 2s have been processed, the 3s spread. Or maybe the 3s spread first, then the 2s overwrite.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 4, the 2 overwrites the left part of the row, and the 3s spread to the right. So if 2s are processed after 3s, that would explain it. So the order would be:\n\n1. Expand all 3s horizontally and vertically.\n\n2. Expand all 2s to the left.\n\nBut in that case, the 2's expansion would overwrite the 3s to the left. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's input row 4: [0,0,0,2,3,0,3,3,3,3]\n\nStep 1: Expand 3s horizontally and vertically.\n\nOriginal 3s in row 4 at columns 4, 6,7,8,9.\n\nExpanding horizontally:\n\n- Column 4's 3: spread left to column 0? If allowed, but there's a 2 at column 3. So in row 4, during horizontal expansion of 3s, the 3 at column 4 would spread left until it hits the 2. So columns 3 is 2, so stops. So row 4's columns 4-9 are 3s, but columns 0-3 are 0s and 2.\n\nBut then step 2: expand the 2 to the left, converting columns 0-3 to 2s.\n\nBut this would result in row 4 being [2,2,2,2,3,0,3,3,3,3], which matches the output.\n\nBut how does the 3's vertical expansion work? For example, the 3 in row 4, column 4 would spread vertically up and down. So column 4, rows 0-9 would become 3s where possible. But in row 4, column 4 is 3, so rows above and below would have 3s filled if they are zeros.\n\nBut after the horizontal expansion of 3s, the vertical expansion would propagate 3s in column 4.\n\nIn Example 0's output, row 3, column 4 is 3, which matches. Row 5, column 4 is 3. So vertical expansion from row 4's 3s would contribute to that.\n\nThis seems plausible. So the steps are:\n\n1. For each 3 in the input:\n\n   a. Spread horizontally in the row, filling left and right with 3s, but stopping at non-zero cells (excluding other 3s).\n\n   b. Spread vertically in the column, filling up and down with 3s, stopping at non-zero cells.\n\n2. For each 2 in the input:\n\n   a. Spread to the left in the row, converting all cells (including 3s and zeros) to 2s.\n\nBut in step 1a, during horizontal spreading, 3s fill left and right until they hit a non-3. Then, in step 2, the 2s overwrite to the left.\n\nLet's apply this to Example 0's row 4:\n\nInput row 4: [0,0,0,2,3,0,3,3,3,3]\n\nStep 1a: Spread 3s horizontally. The 3s in columns 4,6,7,8,9.\n\n- For column 4's 3: spread left until a non-3. Columns 0-3 are zeros and a 2. So the 3 at column 4 spreads left to column 3 (which is 2), so it stops. So column 4's 3 doesn't spread left past the 2.\n\n- For column 6's 3: spread left to column 5 (0) becomes 3, and right to columns 7-9 (already 3s). So row becomes [0,0,0,2,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nStep 1b: Spread vertically from column 4's 3. This would fill column 4 in rows above and below with 3s where possible.\n\nStep 2: Spread the 2 in column 3 to the left. Convert columns 0-3 to 2s. Resulting row 4: [2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nBut the output row 4 is [2,2,2,2,3,0,3,3,3,3]. This doesn't match. So perhaps my steps are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the horizontal spreading of 3s in step 1a only fills contiguous zeros to the left and right. For example, the 3 in column 4 can spread left through zeros until it hits a non-zero (the 2 in column 3), so columns 4-3: but since column 3 is 2, it stops. So in row 4, after step 1a, the 3 in column 4 can't spread left because of the 2. So row 4 after step 1a is [0,0,0,2,3,0,3,3,3,3]. Then step 2: spread the 2 left, converting columns 0-3 to 2s. So row 4 becomes [2,2,2,2,3,0,3,3,3,3], which matches the output.\n\nThen, during step 1b: spread vertically. The 3s in column 4 (row 4) spread up to rows 3, 2, etc., and down to rows 5,6, etc. But row 4's column 4 is 3, so rows above and below in column 4 become 3s if they are zeros.\n\nIn the output, row 3's column 4 is 3 (original 3 in input row 3), but after spreading, it remains. Row 5's column 4 is 3 in the output, which could be from vertical spreading from row 4's column 4.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the steps are:\n\n1. Process 3s:\n\n   a. Horizontally spread each 3 in their row, filling left and right through zeros.\n\n   b. Vertically spread each 3 in their column, filling up and down through zeros.\n\n2. Process 2s:\n\n   a. For each 2, spread left in their row, converting all cells (including 3s and zeros) to 2s.\n\nBut the order here matters. If we process 3s first, then 2s, the 2s will overwrite any 3s to their left.\n\nNow, let's apply this to Example 0:\n\nInput row 4: [0,0,0,2,3,0,3,3,3,3]\n\nStep 1a: Spread 3s horizontally. The 3 in column 4 can spread left until column 3 (which is 2, so stops). The 3s in columns 6,7,8,9 can spread left to column 5 (zero) and right (already 3s). So row becomes [0,0,0,2,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nStep 1b: Spread vertically. The 3s in columns 4,6,7,8,9 would spread up and down. For column 4's 3 in row 4, spread to rows 3 and 5. Row 3's column 4 was already 3. Row 5's column 4 becomes 3.\n\nStep 2: Spread 2s. The 2 in column 3 spreads left, converting columns 0-3 to 2s. So row becomes [2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3]. But in the output, row 4's columns 5 is 0. This suggests that my model is still incorrect.\n\nHmm, in the output row 4, column 5 is 0, but according to the steps above, it would have been filled with 3s during step 1a. This suggests that the horizontal spreading of 3s is not as extensive as I thought.\n\nPerhaps the horizontal spreading for 3s is only to the immediate left and right, not filling the entire row. Or maybe the spreading is only to contiguous zeros adjacent to the 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s only spread to the left and right in their row if there's a contiguous block of zeros. For example, in row 4, the 3 in column 4 is next to a 2 (column 3), so it can't spread left. The 3s in columns 6-9 are contiguous and can spread left to column 5 (zero), making columns 5-9 3s. So after step 1a, row 4 would be [0,0,0,2,3,3,3,3,3,3]. Then step 2: 2 spreads left, making columns 0-3 2s. So row becomes [2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3]. But the output row 4 has column 5 as 0. So this still doesn't match.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me look at the output row 4 again:\n\nOutput row 4: [2,2,2,2,3,0,3,3,3,3]\n\nColumns 5 is 0. So during the 3s' horizontal spread, column 5 wasn't filled. But the 3s in columns 6-9 should have spread left to column 5. Why isn't that happening?\n\nAh, perhaps the 3s' horizontal spread is blocked by the 2's cell. For example, the 3s in columns 6-9 can spread left to column 5, but during the 3s' horizontal spreading, the cell at column 3 is a 2, which blocks the spread. So the 3s in columns 6-9 can spread left to column 5, but not further because there's a non-3 (the 2) in column 3.\n\nWait, no. The 2 is in column 3, and the 3s are in columns 6-9. The cells between them (columns 4-5) are 3 and 0. So during the horizontal spread, the 3s in columns 6-9 would fill column 5, making it 3. So row 4 after step 1a would be [0,0,0,2,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nThen step 2: 2 spreads left, converting columns 0-3 to 2s. The row becomes [2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3]. But the output has column 5 as 0, which doesn't match.\n\nThis indicates a flaw in the hypothesis. Maybe the 3s' horizontal spreading is limited to the original 3's row and doesn't cross certain boundaries.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the horizontal spreading for 3s is only to the immediate left and right, not the entire row. For example, each 3 can spread one cell left and right if they are zeros. But this would require multiple iterations, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s form contiguous blocks. For example, in the input, a group of 3s will expand to fill all zeros adjacent to them, both horizontally and vertically, in all directions, similar to a flood fill. So any zero adjacent to a 3 (horizontally or vertically) becomes a 3, and this process repeats until no more zeros are adjacent.\n\nBut in that case, the 2s would need to be processed after the 3s' flood fill.\n\nLet's try this approach:\n\n1. Flood fill all 3s: For each 3 in the input, perform a flood fill to all adjacent (including diagonal?) zeros, converting them to 3s. This is done recursively or iteratively until no more zeros are adjacent to any 3.\n\n2. For each 2 in the input, spread left in their row, converting all cells to the left (including the 2's cell) to 2s, regardless of their current value.\n\nBut in Example 0's input row 4:\n\nAfter flood fill, the 3s in column 4 would spread to adjacent zeros. The 3 in column 4 is adjacent to a 2 (column 3) and a zero (column 5). So the 3 can spread to column 5 (zero), converting it to 3. The 3s in columns 6-9 would spread left to column 5, which is now a 3, so no change. Then, the 2 in column 3 is processed, spreading left to columns 0-3, converting them to 2s. The resulting row would be [2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3]. But the output has column 5 as 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the flood fill approach is not correct.\n\nAlternative idea: The 3s only spread in their row, not column, and the 2s spread left. But how to explain the vertical spread in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical spreading of 3s is handled by a different rule. For example, each 3 in a column causes the entire column to be filled with 3s from that position upwards and downwards until a non-zero is encountered.\n\nSo, for Example 0's input row 3: columns 3 and 4 have 3s. The vertical spread would fill column 3 and 4 in all rows below and above until a non-zero is hit.\n\nBut in the output, row 3's column 0-4 are 3s (horizontal spread), and the vertical spread would fill column 3 and 4 in rows below.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. \n\nLet me try to find a different pattern. Looking at the test input:\n\nTest input has a vertical block of 3s in rows 0-10, columns 4-6. Then, a 2 in row 5, column 4. Then, in the lower part, there's a horizontal block of 3s and a 2 in row 14, column 13.\n\nFollowing the pattern from the examples, the 2 in row 5, column 4 should spread left in its row, converting columns 0-4 to 2s. The 3s in that row would spread right. Then, the vertical spread of 3s from the original 3s would fill columns 4-6 vertically.\n\nIn the test input's lower part, there's a horizontal line of 3s in row 14 with a 2 in column 13. The output would have the 2 spreading left in its row, converting columns 0-13 to 2s, but the 3s to the right (columns 14-19) would remain.\n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples?\n\nAlternatively, the final answer for the test input would have the 2 in row 5, column 4 spreading left, converting columns 0-4 to 2s. The 3s in that row would spread right, columns 5-6. The vertical spread of 3s from columns 4-6 would fill the rows below and above.\n\nIn the lower part, the 2 in row 14, column 13 would spread left, converting columns 0-13 to 2s, and the 3s in columns 14-19 would remain.\n\nBut considering the test input's lower part has a 2 in row 14, column 13. The row 14 in the test input is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\nProcessing the 2 first (spread left), converting columns 0-13 to 2s. Then the 3s to the right (columns 14-19) remain. So row 14's output would be [2,2,...,2,3,3,...].\n\nBut according to the training examples, when there's a 2 in a row, it spreads left, converting all to 2s, and the 3s to the right of the 2 remain.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nThe first part (rows 0-10) have a vertical block of 3s in columns 4-6. The 2 in row 5, column 4 would spread left to columns 0-4, making them 2s. The 3s in columns 5-6 would spread right and left (but left is blocked by 2s). The vertical spread of the 3s would fill the columns 4-6 in all rows above and below where possible.\n\nThe lower part (row 14) has a 2 in column 13. It would spread left to columns 0-13, making them 2s. The 3s in columns 14-19 would remain.\n\nThus, the output for the test input would have rows 0-4 in columns 4-6 filled with 3s (vertical spread), and row 5's columns 0-4 as 2s and 5-6 as 3s. The lower rows would have row 14's columns 0-13 as 2s and 14-19 as 3s.\n\nAdditionally, any 3s in other parts would spread vertically and horizontally. For example, the vertical block of 3s in columns 4-6 would spread down to the lower part if possible.\n\nBut looking at the test input's lower part (rows 14-19) have 3s in columns 7-19. So after processing, the vertical spread of 3s from these columns would fill upwards and downwards.\n\nThis is a bit speculative, but based on the training examples, I'll proceed with this approach.",
