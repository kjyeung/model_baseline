        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input and output grids. The task is to determine how the input is transformed into the output. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some 3s at the corners and some 2s in the middle. The output seems to have the 3s in the same positions. The 2s are shifted. Like, in the input's third row, there's a row of five 2s. In the output, that row is moved down to the fourth row, and it's centered with five 2s again. Also, some of the other 2s are moved to the left or right. Maybe there's a rotation or reflection happening here?\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has 3s on the second and eighth columns, maybe. The output shows that the 3s remain in the same positions. The 2s in the input's rows 3-6 are arranged differently in the output. For instance, the third row in the input is [2,2,2,0,...], and in the output, it's shifted to the right. Wait, the output's third row has 0s then 2,2,2. Maybe a right shift? Or maybe a mirror flip vertically or horizontally?\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is a vertical flip, but preserving the 3s. Let me check. In Example 0, the input has 3s at the top and bottom corners. The output keeps those 3s in the same place. The middle rows with 2s are perhaps being shifted downward. Like, the third row in the input (index 2) becomes the fourth row in the output (index 3). So maybe each row is shifted down by one, but wrapping around? But in Example 0, the input has 7 rows, output 7 rows. So shifting down by one, but the 3s stay. Wait, but the first and last rows in the input are the same in the output. So maybe only the middle rows (excluding the first and last) are shifted down, and maybe also mirrored?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the positions of 2s. In Example 0's input, the third row is all 2s. In the output, it's moved to the fourth row. Similarly, in Example 1, the input's third row (index 2) is [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0], and in the output, the third row becomes [0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0]. So the 2s are shifted to the right by two positions. Wait, but how does that fit with other rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each group of 2s is being moved down and to the right. Or perhaps the entire grid is rotated 180 degrees, but the 3s are kept in place. Wait, but in Example 0, the input's third row is a line of 2s. If rotated 180, the third row (of 7 rows) would stay in the middle. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the 3s are fixed markers, and the 2s are moving according to some rule. Let's see. In the input, the 2s form certain shapes, and in the output, they are shifted. For example, in Example 0, the input's third row is five 2s. The output's fourth row has five 2s. So maybe each 2 is shifted down by one, but only if they are part of a contiguous block? But how do the positions shift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are shifted diagonally. Like, each 2 moves down and to the right. Let's check. In Example 0's input, the third row (index 2) has 2s starting from column 0 to 4. If shifted down and to the right by one, they would be in row 3, columns 1-5. But the output's row 3 has 2s in columns 0,1,2,3,4. Hmm, not matching. Maybe not a diagonal shift.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input row 3: [2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Output row 3 is [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0]. So the 2s are shifted two positions to the right. But how? The input's third row is [2,2,2, ...], and output's third row is shifted two places. But why two?\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are being shifted in a way that depends on their original position relative to the 3s. The 3s are fixed. Let's see. Maybe the 2s are moving towards the center. In Example 0, the input has a vertical line of 2s in the middle. The output has a horizontal line. So maybe it's a rotation of some sort. But keeping the 3s in place.\n\nWait, another thought: the output looks like the input's 2s are being rotated 90 degrees clockwise, but the 3s remain in their corners. Let's check. Take Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal 2s in input row 2: positions 0-4 (columns 0 to 4). If rotated 90 degrees, that row would become a vertical column. But the output's row 3 has a horizontal line. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a reflection. For example, flipping the grid horizontally, but keeping the 3s in place. Let's see. In Example 0's input, row 1 is [0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. If flipped horizontally, it would become [0,0,0,0,2,2,0]. The output's row 1 is [0,0,0,2,0,0,0]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: Each 2 in the input is moved to a new position based on some rules. For example, moving each 2 down by one row and right by one column, but wrapping around. But in Example 0's input, the third row's 2s would move down to row 4, columns shifted right. But in the output's row 3 (index 3) there are 2s in columns 0-4. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the test input. Let's see what the input is. The test input has 10 rows and 8 columns. The 3s are in rows 1 and 7, columns 0 and 6. Then there are a bunch of 2s in rows 2-6, starting from column 0 and increasing in number. For example, row 2 is [2,0,0,...], row 3 has two 2s, row 4 three, row 5 five, row 6 a single 2. The output would need to be transformed based on the pattern from the examples.\n\nLooking at the examples, the 3s are always in the same positions in the output. The 2s are rearranged. Let's look for a pattern in how the 2s are moved.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal 2s are in rows 1,2,3,4. The output's 2s are in rows 1,2,3,4. So maybe the rows are shifted down. For instance, row 2 in input (with five 2s) becomes row 3 in output. Row 1's 2s (columns 1 and 2) become column 3 in output. So perhaps each 2 is shifted down by one and to the right by two? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are shifted in such a way that the entire structure is mirrored vertically but moved down. For example, the original 2s are in a certain pattern, and the output is that pattern flipped and shifted down.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern involves shifting each 2 to a new position based on their distance from the nearest 3. But that might be complicated.\n\nAnother approach: look at the test input and see what the output would be if the pattern from examples is applied.\n\nTest input has 3s in rows 1 and 7, columns 0 and 6. The 2s are in rows 2-6. Let's see:\n\nRow 2: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 3: [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 4: [2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 5: [2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0]\nRow 6: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nIf we look at the examples, the 2s in the input are transformed into a different arrangement. For instance, in Example 0, the input's 2s are clustered towards the left, and the output's 2s are more towards the center or right.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 2s are in the left part, and the output shifts them to the right. For example, the third row in input has three 2s starting at column 2, and in the output they are shifted right to column 4-6. So maybe a shift to the right by two columns.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's input, the first row (after the 3s) has 2s at columns 1 and 2. The output for that row has a single 2 at column 3. So that's shifted right by two as well.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that all 2s are shifted two columns to the right and one row down. But how do they handle the boundaries? For example, if shifting right pushes them beyond the grid, perhaps they wrap around or are truncated.\n\nBut looking at Example 0's third row (input row 2): [2,2,2,2,2,0,0]. Shifting right by two would make them start at column 2, but in the output's row 3, they are still starting at column 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So that theory is probably wrong.\n\nAlternatively, the shift might depend on the row. For example, each row's 2s are shifted right by (row index) positions. But not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. Let's take the input's row 2: [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0]. The output's row 2 is [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]. So shifted right by two. Hmm. The input row 4 is [2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0]. The output row 4 is [0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0]. So shifted left by one? That's inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the 2s are being shifted such that the entire block of 2s is moved towards the center. For example, in Example 0's input, the 2s are in the middle rows, and in the output, they form a diamond shape. Maybe the blocks of 2s are rotated or arranged into a different shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each line of 2s is rotated 90 degrees clockwise around the center of the grid. But the 3s stay in place. Let's think.\n\nIn Example 0, the input's third row is a horizontal line of 2s. Rotating 90 degrees would turn it into a vertical line. Looking at the output, the fourth row (index 3) is a horizontal line. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being transposed (rows and columns swapped), but again, the 3s stay. For example, in Example 0's input, the third row (row 2) has 2s from column 0 to 4. Transposing would make column 2 have 2s from row 0 to 4. But the output's column 3 (maybe) doesn't show that. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the number of 2s in each row. For example, in Example 0's input, row 1 has two 2s, row 2 has five, row 3 has one, row 4 has two. The output's rows 1 has one, row 2 has two, row 3 has five, row 4 has two. So it's like the rows are shifted downward. Row 2's 2s move to row 3, row 1's to row 2, etc. But the first and last rows (with 3s) stay the same. So perhaps the middle rows are shifted down by one, and within those rows, the 2s are arranged differently. But how?\n\nWait, in Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal rows (excluding first and last):\n\nRow 1: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 2: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nRow 3: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 4: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn the output, the same rows (excluding first and last):\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,2,2,2,2,2,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nSo the original row 1 (input) becomes output row 1, but shifted to the center. Original row 2 (five 2s) becomes output row 3. Original row 3 becomes output row 4, etc. So maybe the middle rows are being shifted down by two, but only the 2s? Or perhaps the 2s from each row are being moved down two rows and centered.\n\nAlternatively, the entire block of 2s is shifted down by one row and to the right by two columns. Let's check:\n\nOriginal row 1 (index 1) in input has 2s at columns 1 and 2. Output row 1 (same index) has a 2 at column 3. So shifted right by two. Original row 2 (five 2s) in input is row 2. In output, it's row 3 (index 3), shifted down by one. But the columns are still 0-4. Hmm, maybe not. Unless it's shifted right as well, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are shifted in a way that they form a diamond shape. For example, in Example 0's output, the 2s form a diamond with the center at row 3. The input's 2s are arranged vertically. Maybe the transformation is to rotate the 2s into a diamond pattern, keeping the 3s fixed.\n\nBut how does that apply to the other examples? For Example 1's input, which has 2s arranged in a certain pattern, the output seems to spread them into a diamond-like shape as well.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be a combination of shifting rows and columns. For example, the 2s are shifted down by one row and to the right by two columns, but wrapping around if necessary. However, in the examples, the shifting seems to vary, making this approach inconsistent.\n\nAnother idea: the 3s mark the corners of a frame, and the 2s inside are being rotated 180 degrees. For example, in Example 0, the input's 2s are arranged in a vertical line, and the output's 2s are arranged in a horizontal line in the middle. Rotating the interior of the frame (excluding the 3s) 180 degrees would cause such a shift.\n\nBut how to define the frame? The 3s are at the corners. The area inside the 3s (excluding the first and last rows and columns) is rotated 180. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 3s are at positions (0,0), (0,6), (6,0), (6,6). The interior is rows 1-5, columns 1-5. If we rotate that 180 degrees, then each 2 would move to the mirrored position within that frame. For example, a 2 at (1,1) would go to (5,5), but in the output, the 2s are not there. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the interior is shifted down and to the right. For example, each row in the interior is shifted down by one and to the right by two. But this is getting too vague.\n\nLet me try to compare the input and output for each example more carefully.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput row 1 (index 1): [0,2,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row 1: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nSo the two 2s in columns 1 and 2 are replaced with a single 2 in column 3.\n\nInput row 2: [2,2,2,2,2,0,0]\n\nOutput row 3: [0,2,2,2,2,2,0]\n\nSo the five 2s are centered in the output row 3.\n\nInput row 3: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row 4: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the single 2 in column 1 moves to column 2.\n\nInput row 4: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row 5: [0,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nSo the two 2s in columns 1-2 move to columns 2-3.\n\nHmm, this seems like each 2 in the input is shifted to the right by one column and down by two rows? Wait:\n\nInput row 1, column 1 \u2192 Output row 1, column 3. So shifted right by two, same row. No, but in row 1, output has 2 at column 3. Original 2s in columns 1 and 2. So if they move right by two, column 3 and 4. But output row 1 has only one 2. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s in each row are centered. Like, in input row 2, the five 2s are centered in output row 3. Input row 1's two 2s are centered in output row 1's column 3 (middle of the row). But the row length is 7, so the center is index 3. So maybe each group of 2s is centered in their respective row in the output, and shifted down by one row.\n\nWait, for input row 2 (five 2s), centered in row 3. Input row 1 (two 2s) centered in row 1. But output row 1's 2 is at column 3 (center). So two 2s would require columns 2 and 3, but output has one. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are arranged into a diamond shape. For example, the output of Example 0 has a diamond where each layer has more 2s. Row 3 has five 2s, row 2 and 4 have three, row 1 and 5 have one. But the input's 2s are arranged differently. So maybe the transformation is to form a diamond pattern.\n\nBut how does the input's 2s get transformed into that? Maybe the 2s are spread out to form a diamond. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that the 2s are rotated 90 degrees clockwise, but only the 2s, with the 3s fixed. Let's see. In Example 0, the input's rows with 2s form a vertical line. Rotating 90 degrees would turn them into a horizontal line, which matches the output's row 3.\n\nSo, if the entire 2 structure is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, but the 3s stay in the corners, that might work. Let's check this hypothesis.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nInput's 2s are in columns 1-2 (row 1), columns 0-4 (row 2), column 1 (row 3), columns 1-2 (row4). Rotating 90 degrees clockwise would transpose these positions. For example, the vertical line in row 2 (columns 0-4) would become a horizontal line in column 2 (rows 0-4). But the output's row 3 has a horizontal line. Wait, but rotating the entire grid (including the 3s) would move the 3s, but in the output, the 3s are in the same place. So perhaps only the 2s are rotated, while the 3s remain fixed.\n\nBut how to rotate the 2s around the center while keeping the 3s in place.\n\nAlternatively, the center of rotation is the center of the grid. For a 7x7 grid, the center is at (3,3). Rotating the 2s 90 degrees clockwise around this point. Let's see.\n\nFor example, input's row 2, column 0 (2) would rotate to row 0, column 3 + (3 - 0) = column 6? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, each point (x,y) is rotated to (y, len-1 -x). For a 90-degree rotation.\n\nIn a 7x7 grid, len is 7. So for a point (x,y), rotated 90 degrees clockwise becomes (y, 6 - x).\n\nSo for example, input's row 2 (x=2), column 0 (y=0). Rotated becomes (0, 6-2=4). So new position is row 0, column 4. But in the output, row 0 is [3,0,0,...3], so there's no 2 there. So that theory may not hold.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: look for the movement of the 2s in each example and see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the third row has 2s at columns 2-4. In the output, these are shifted to columns 4-6. So shifted right by two. The fourth row's 2s in input (columns 0-2) are shifted to columns 2-4 in output. Also a shift of two to the right. Similarly, the fifth row's 2s in input (columns 0,2) become columns 2 and 4 in output. So perhaps a shift to the right by two columns.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the second row has 2s starting at column 0. Output's third row has 2s starting at column 0 again. So perhaps no shift there. Hmm, this is inconsistent.\n\nAnother observation: in the output of all examples, the 2s are arranged symmetrically around the vertical center line. For example, Example 0's output has the third row (index 3) with 2s centered. Example 1's output third row has 2s centered. The test input's 2s are clustered towards the left, so the output would have them centered.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is to center the 2s in each row, shifting them to the center. For example, if a row has a certain number of 2s, they are centered in that row in the output. But how does that explain the shift in rows?\n\nAlternatively, each group of 2s in a row is centered within the row, and the rows themselves are arranged symmetrically around the middle row. For example, in Example 0, the input's row 2 (five 2s) is moved to the middle row (row 3) and centered. Other rows' 2s are also centered and shifted to different rows.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is:\n\n- The 3s remain in their original positions.\n- The 2s are rearranged such that each contiguous block of 2s in a row is centered within that row.\n- The rows containing 2s are then stacked in a way that forms a diamond shape, with the longest row in the middle.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's input, the rows with 2s are rows 1-4. The number of 2s in each row is 2,5,1,2. In the output, the rows with 2s are arranged such that the longest row (5 2s) is in the middle (row 3), and the others are arranged above and below, each centered. So row 1 has 1 centered 2, row 2 has 2 centered 2s, row 3 has 5, row 4 has 1, row 5 has 2.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's output, row 3 has five 2s centered. Rows 2 and 4 have two and two, but row 1 has one, row 5 has two. Hmm, maybe the rows are sorted by the number of 2s, with the largest in the middle.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Keep the 3s in their original positions.\n\n2. For all other rows, collect the groups of 2s and count their lengths.\n\n3. Sort these groups in descending order of length, placing the longest in the middle row of the output, and the others above and below, each centered in their respective rows.\n\nBut how are the original rows mapped to the output rows?\n\nAlternatively, each row's 2s are centered, and the rows are arranged such that the row with the most 2s is in the middle, and the others are ordered by decreasing length above and below.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the row with 5 2s is row 2. In the output, it's row 3. Then the rows with 2 2s are rows 1 and 4 in the input. In the output, they are rows 2 and 5, which have two 2s each. The row with 1 2 in input row 3 is output row 4. So it's like the rows are ordered based on the number of 2s, with the longest in the middle.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n- Preserve the 3s.\n- For the rows that contain 2s, sort them in such a way that the row with the most 2s is placed in the middle of the output's available rows (excluding the first and last rows which have 3s), and the others are placed in order of decreasing length above and below.\n- Each row's 2s are centered in their new row.\n\nBut in Example 0, the output has rows with 1, 2, 5, 2, 2. Wait, the input has rows with 2,5,1,2. So sorted by length: 5,2,2,1. The middle row would be 5, then 2, then 2, then 1. So output rows would be 5,2,2,1. But the output's middle rows are 3 (5), 2 (2), 4 (1), 1 (1), 5 (2). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, it's not about sorting, but shifting rows down by a certain amount and centering the 2s.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Let's look at the test input and see what the expected output might be.\n\nTest input's rows with 2s:\n\nRow 2: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 1 two.\n\nRow 3: [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 2 twos.\n\nRow 4: [2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 3 twos.\n\nRow 5: [2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0] \u21925 twos.\n\nRow 6: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u21921 two.\n\nIf the pattern is to center the 2s in each row and arrange the rows such that the longest row is in the middle, then:\n\nThe rows with 2s would be ordered with 5,3,2,1,1. So the middle row is the one with 5 twos. Then the rows with 3, then 2, then two rows with 1.\n\nIn the test input, the output would have:\n\n- The 3s stay in their positions.\n\n- The middle rows (excluding first and last) would be arranged with the longest row (5 twos) centered in the middle, then the other rows above and below.\n\nThe test input has 10 rows. The first and last rows (rows 0 and 9) are all zeros. The rows with 3s are rows 1 and 7. So the rows to process are rows 2-6 and 8. But row 8 is all zeros. So rows 2-6 (indices 2-6) have 2s.\n\nThe middle of these rows (rows 2-6) is row 4 (index 4). The longest row is row 5 (index 5) with 5 twos. So this row would be placed in the middle of the output's rows. Then, rows with 3, 2, 1, 1 twos are arranged around it.\n\nThe rows in the output would be:\n\nRow 2: 1 two centered.\n\nRow 3: 2 twos centered.\n\nRow 4: 3 twos centered.\n\nRow 5: 5 twos centered.\n\nRow 6: 1 two centered.\n\nBut the test input has rows 2-6 as follows:\n\nRow 2: 1 two.\n\nRow 3: 2 twos.\n\nRow 4: 3 twos.\n\nRow 5: 5 twos.\n\nRow 6: 1 two.\n\nSo if we center each row's 2s, then:\n\nRow 2's 1 two would be in the middle of the 8 columns, which is column 3.5 \u2192 rounded to column 4 (since even number of columns, perhaps column 3 or 4).\n\nBut the output rows would need to have the 2s centered. For example:\n\n- Row 2 (original) has one 2. Centered would be position 3 or 4 (since 8 columns). Let's say column 3.\n\n- Row 3 (two 2s) would be centered at columns 3 and 4.\n\n- Row 4 (three 2s) would be centered at columns 3,4,5.\n\n- Row 5 (five 2s) would be centered at columns 2-6.\n\n- Row 6 (one 2) centered at column 3.\n\nBut how does this fit with the examples?\n\nIn Example 0's input row 1 has two 2s, which in the output are centered as one 2 in column 3. That doesn't make sense. So maybe centering involves padding on both sides.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are moved to the center of the entire grid. For example, in the test input's row 5, which has five 2s, centering them in the 8 columns would start at column 1 (since 5 elements need positions 1-5, which is centered). But in an even-length row, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, the entire block of 2s is centered horizontally and vertically within the grid, excluding the 3s.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe the pattern is that each 2 is shifted to the right by two columns and down by one row. Let's test this.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow 2, column 0 (2) \u2192 shifted to row 3, column 2.\n\nRow 3, columns 0-1 (2,2) \u2192 row 4, columns 2-3.\n\nRow 4, columns 0-2 \u2192 row5, columns 2-4.\n\nRow 5, columns 0-4 \u2192 row6, columns 2-6.\n\nRow6, column 0 \u2192 row7, column2.\n\nBut in the output, row 7 is [3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0], which is part of the 3s' rows. So this would cause conflicts. Also, the 3s are in rows 1 and 7. Shifting down by one may overwrite the 3s.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are shifted to the right by two columns and down by one row, but the 3s are preserved and overwrite any 2s that would be in their positions.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nTest input row 2 (2) \u2192 shifted to row 3, column 2.\n\nRow3 (2,2) \u2192 row4, columns 2-3.\n\nRow4 (3 twos) \u2192 row5, columns 2-4.\n\nRow5 (5 twos) \u2192 row6, columns 2-6.\n\nRow6 (2) \u2192 row7, column2.\n\nBut row7 has 3 in column0 and 6. So the shifted 2s would be in rows 3-7, columns 2-6. The output would have:\n\nRow3: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0]\n\nRow7: [3,0,2,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nBut this would conflict with the 3s in row7. So maybe this isn't the case.\n\nAnother angle: in all examples, the output's 2s form a symmetrical pattern around the vertical center. Perhaps each input's 2s are mirrored horizontally and shifted down.\n\nFor example, the test input's 2s are all on the left side. Mirroring them would put them on the right, then shifted down.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2s are on the left and middle. Output has them mirrored to the right and centered.\n\nBut how does shifting down work?\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me look at another example.\n\nExample 3's input:\n\nRow 2: [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row 2: [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nSo mirrored horizontally within the row. Original starts at column 1, output starts at column 2. So mirrored with an offset.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, each row is reversed. For example, input row 2: [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0] reversed becomes [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0], but that's not the case. Output row2 is [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]. So reversed but with padding.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s in each row are centered. So the input row2 has 3 2s. To center them in 8 columns, they'd start at column 2 ( (8-3)/2 = 2.5 \u2192 floor to 2). So columns 2-4. But the output row2 starts at column 2.\n\nOriginal input row2 starts at column1. So maybe each group of 2s is centered in the row.\n\nThis seems plausible. So the pattern is:\n\n- The 3s remain in their positions.\n\n- For each row in the input, any group of 2s is centered in that row in the output.\n\n- Additionally, the rows are reordered such that the row with the longest sequence of 2s is placed in the middle of the output grid, with other rows arranged around it in descending order of length.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's input, the longest row (5 2s) is placed in the middle row (row3) of the output. Other rows are ordered such that their lengths decrease as you move away from the middle.\n\nIn the test input, the longest row is row5 (5 2s). This would be placed in the middle of the output's rows (excluding the 3 rows). The test input has 10 rows. The rows with 3s are rows 1 and 7. The rows with 2s are rows 2-6. The middle of these 5 rows is row4 (index4). So the longest row (row5 in input, which has 5 2s) would be placed in row4 of the output's middle section. Then the other rows (3,2,1,1) would be arranged around it.\n\nBut how are the rows ordered?\n\nLet's think:\n\nInput rows with 2s:\n\nRow2:1 two\n\nRow3:2 twos\n\nRow4:3 twos\n\nRow5:5 twos\n\nRow6:1 two\n\nSo sorted by length:5,3,2,1,1.\n\nIn the output's middle section (rows 2-6), the middle row is row4. So:\n\nRow4:5 twos\n\nRow3:3 twos\n\nRow5:2 twos\n\nRow2:1 two\n\nRow6:1 two\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the rows are arranged in such a way that the longest is in the center, then next longest above and below, etc. So the order would be:\n\nRow4 (5)\n\nRow3 (3)\n\nRow5 (2)\n\nRow2 (1)\n\nRow6 (1)\n\nBut how to determine their positions.\n\nAlternatively, the rows are arranged in the order of descending length, with the longest in the center. For example:\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:5\n\nRow5:3\n\nRow6:1\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the rows are sorted in descending order of 2s, placed in the middle rows. For example:\n\nMiddle row (row4) has 5 twos.\n\nAbove that, row3 has3.\n\nThen row2 has 2.\n\nRow5 and row6 have 1.\n\nBut this doesn't match the examples.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nThe common pattern seems to be that the 2s are shifted to the right and down, forming a symmetrical pattern. The 3s remain in place. The test input's 2s are all on the left side. The output should have them centered and possibly shifted down.\n\nLooking at the test input, the rows with 2s are rows 2-6. The longest row is row5 with 5 2s. In the output, this row should be centered. So in row5 of the output (if the rows are adjusted), the 5 2s would be centered. The other rows would have their 2s centered and arranged around it.\n\nSo the output for the test input would have:\n\nRow2: 1 two centered.\n\nRow3: 2 twos centered.\n\nRow4: 3 twos centered.\n\nRow5:5 twos centered.\n\nRow6:1 two centered.\n\nThus, the transformed rows would look like:\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, the original rows 2-6 are rows 2-6 in the test input. The output would need to center each row's 2s and arrange them in order of length, but keeping the 3s in rows 1 and 7.\n\nBut the output has to preserve the 3s. The test input's 3s are in rows 1 and 7, columns 0 and 6.\n\nSo the output would have the same rows 1 and 7 with 3s.\n\nThe other rows (2-6, 8-9) would have the 2s centered.\n\nBut given the test input's rows with 2s (rows 2-6), let's center each row's 2s:\n\nRow2: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 1 two \u2192 centered in an 8-column row. Since it's odd number of elements, the center would be between columns 3 and 4. So either column 3 or 4. Let's assume column 3 for even length. So output row2: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow3: [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 2 twos \u2192 centered at columns 3 and4. \u2192 [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0].\n\nRow4: [2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u21923 twos \u2192 centered at columns 2,3,4. \u2192 [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0].\n\nRow5: [2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0] \u21925 twos \u2192 centered at columns 1,2,3,4,5. \u2192 [0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0].\n\nRow6: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u21921 two \u2192 same as row2: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0].\n\nSo the output rows 2-6 would be:\n\n[0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n\n[0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut also, rows 8 and 9 are all zeros.\n\nPutting it all together, the output should have:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking back at the examples, especially Example 3, the rows with 2s are not just centered but also shifted down. For example, in Example 3's input, the rows with 2s are shifted down and centered.\n\nIn the test input's case, the longest row (5 2s) is in row5 of the input. In the output, it would be centered and placed in the middle of the grid's available rows. The test input has 10 rows. The middle rows are around row4.5. So rows4 and5. But considering the 3s are in rows1 and7, the available rows for 2s are rows2-6 and8-9. But perhaps the longest row is placed in the middle of the grid, row5.\n\nSo, the output would arrange the 2s such that the longest row is in row5, with others above and below.\n\nThus, the final output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWait, but how does this align with the examples? For instance, in Example 0, the longest row is in the middle. Maybe the rows are shifted down so that the longest is in the center.\n\nGiven the complexity, I think the correct approach is to center the 2s in each row and arrange the rows in order of decreasing length, with the longest in the middle. Thus, the test input's output would have the 5 2s in the middle row, 3 2s above, 2 above that, and 1s at the top and bottom.",
