        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is transformed into an output. The first thing I notice is that the numbers 2 and 8 are present in the inputs and outputs. Maybe they're moving in some way?\n\nIn Example 0, the input has some 2s in rows 2 and 3, and 8s in rows 10 and 11. The output moves the 2s down to rows 8 and 9, but the 8s stay in the same rows. Wait, no, the 8s in the input are at rows 10 and 11, and in the output they're also in rows 10 and 11. But the 2s shifted down. So maybe 2s are falling down, and 8s stay in place?\n\nLooking at Example 1: the input has 2s and 8s. The output shifts the 2s to the right. For instance, in the input row 4, there's a 8,8 in columns 7 and 8, and in the output, those stay. But the 2s in row 1 and 2 shifted to the right. Wait, row 1 input is [0,2,2,0,...], output row 1 becomes [0,0,0,0,2,2...]. So they moved right by 3 positions? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Or maybe they moved to the center? Or perhaps it's a gravity effect where blocks fall down, but in some direction.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the 2s and 8s are acting like different elements. The 2s might be moving downwards or to the right, while 8s are fixed. Or perhaps the 2s are moving, and 8s are stationary. Let me check Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2's input, the 8s are in rows 1 and 2, same as the output. The 2s in the input are in rows 6,7,8. The output moves those 2s up to rows 3,4,5. Wait, the input's rows 6,7,8 are:\n\n[0,0,0,2,2,2,0...]\n[0,2,2,2,2,2,0...]\n[0,0,2,2,0,0,0...]\n\nIn the output, those rows are now rows 3,4,5. So the 2s moved up. But why? That contradicts the previous examples where 2s moved down. Hmm, maybe there's another pattern here.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that the 2s and 8s are sorted in some way. Like, the entire grid is shifted such that all 2s and 8s are shifted towards the bottom or top, but the order of rows is preserved. Wait, in Example 0, the 2s in rows 2 and 3 of the input moved to rows 8 and 9 in the output, which are lower. But in Example 2, the 2s moved up. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows containing 2s and 8s are being reordered. Let me look at Example 0's input and output. The input has 2s in rows 2 and 3, and 8s in rows 10 and 11. The output has the 2s in rows 8 and 9, 8s in 10 and 11. So the 2s moved down, and the 8s stayed. So perhaps the rows with 2s are moved down as far as possible, but 8s stay. Then, the empty rows (all zeros) are kept in their original positions, except for the ones that are being replaced by the moving 2s.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, there's a bunch of zeros between the 2s and 8s. The output moves the 2s to the bottom, but above the 8s. So maybe the 2s fall down until they hit the 8s or the bottom.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 2s in rows 1,2,3,4 and 8s in rows 4 and 5. The output shows the 2s shifted to the right. Wait, in row 1 of the output, the 2s are in columns 4 and 5. Original row 1 had them in 1 and 2. So moved right by 3. That's odd. Alternatively, maybe the 2s are shifted to the right as much as possible without overlapping with other numbers. But how does that work with the 8s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is processed to shift non-zero elements to the right or left. For example, in Example 1's input row 4: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]. In the output, this becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 0, 0]. So the 2s shifted to the right, moving past the zeros, but stopping before the 8s. So maybe for each row, the non-zero elements (2s and 8s) are shifted to the right, with 8s acting as fixed blocks, and 2s can move through zeros but stop before 8s or other 2s.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Like in a puzzle where blocks are shifted right, and 2s are movable, 8s are fixed. So in each row, the 2s are pushed as far right as possible, but can't go past 8s or other 2s. Let me test this with Example 1.\n\nIn input row 1: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Shifting 2s to the right as far as possible. The output is [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. So the two 2s moved from positions 1-2 to 4-5. Because there's space to the right. The zeros to the right of them allowed them to shift.\n\nIn input row 4: [0,2,2,0,0,0,8,8,0,0]. The 2s can't move past the 8s, so they shift right as much as possible. The 8s are in positions 6 and 7. So the 2s start at positions 1-2. They can shift right until they hit the 8s. The zeros between 2 and 8s are positions 3,4,5. So shifting the 2s to positions 4-5. So the row becomes [0,0,0,0,2,2,8,8,0,0]. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 2: [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. Shifting right would move the 2s to the end? Let's see the output row 8: [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, in the output, the 2s are in the same positions. So this contradicts. Unless perhaps the shifting is not per row but columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are falling down in their columns, while 8s are fixed. So in each column, the 2s move down as far as possible, past zeros, until they hit a 8 or another 2 or the bottom.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input. Let's take the columns where 2s are present. For example, in column 1 (0-based?), let's see. Wait, the input has rows with 2s. For example, in row 3 (third row), the input is [2,2,0,2,0,...]. So column 0 has a 2 in row 3. The output for row 8 is [2,2,0,2,0,...]. So perhaps each 2 in a column falls down until it hits a 8 or another 2. But in column 0 of the input, the 2 is in row 3. In the output, it's in row 8. So that would require that there's space below. Let's check the input rows below row 3. Rows 4 to 13 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but the output's rows 8 and 9 have the 2s, which are lower than in the input. So perhaps each 2 in a column is moved to the lowest possible position in that column, considering that 8s are fixed.\n\nWait, let's think of each column individually. For example, in column 1 of Example 0's input:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 2 (maybe index 2 if starting from 0) has 2 in column 1.\n\nRow 3 has 2 in column 0 and 1.\n\nLooking at the output, in column 1, the 2s are in rows 8 and 9. So perhaps in each column, the 2s are moved down as far as possible, stacking at the bottom of the column, below any 8s. Wait, but in the input, the 8s are in rows 10 and 11 (if rows are 0-based). So in the output, the 2s are in rows 8 and 9, which are above the 8s. So the 2s can't pass through 8s, but they settle just above them if possible.\n\nSo the rule might be: for each column, move all 2s down as far as possible, stacking them, while 8s remain fixed and block the 2s from moving further.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example 0.\n\nIn column 1 of input:\n\nRow 2 has 2, row 3 has 2. So in the column, the 2s are at positions 2 and 3. The output has them at 8 and 9. But why? Because there are zeros below them. Let's check the input for column 1. From row 4 to row 13 (assuming rows are 0-based?), all are zeros except for row 2 and 3. So if we move the 2s down as far as possible, they would end up in the bottom of the column. But in the output, they are in rows 8 and 9, which are not the bottom. Wait, maybe the 8s are in columns 3 and 4 in rows 10 and 11, which are in the same columns as the 2s? No, in Example 0, the 8s are in columns 3 and 4 of rows 10 and 11. The 2s are in columns 0,1,2,3 in some rows. So perhaps columns with 2s and 8s are separate. So for columns that have 2s, the 2s fall to the bottom, ignoring 8s in other columns. That could be possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each column is treated independently. For each column, if there are 2s and 8s, the 2s fall down until they hit an 8 or the bottom.\n\nIn Example 0's column 3: input has 2 in row 3. Output has 2 in row 8. Wait, that's a big jump. But maybe there are 8s in column 3 in rows 10 and 11. So the 2 in column 3 can't go past rows 10 and 11. So the 2 would settle at row 9 (if possible). But in the output, the 2s are in row 8 and 9. Hmm, maybe I need to look at each column's structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire group of 2s is moved down as a block, not per cell. Like, in Example 0, the 2s form a certain shape, and that shape is shifted down until it hits 8s or the bottom.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2s are in rows 2 and 3. The output moves them to rows 8 and 9. The 8s are in rows 10 and 11. So perhaps the 2s are shifted down by 6 rows, but that's a fixed number. But Example 1 and 2 don't follow this. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input has 2s in rows 1,2,3,4 and 8s in rows 4 and 5. In the output, the 2s are shifted to the right. For example, in row 1 of input, 2s are in columns 1 and 2; in output, columns 4 and 5. So shifted right by 3. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the 2s in each row are pushed as far right as possible, while 8s are stationary. So in each row, the non-8 elements (2s and zeros) are shifted to the right, with 2s moving past zeros but stopping at 8s or the end of the row.\n\nSo for each row, we take the 2s and zeros, push them to the right, but 8s stay in their original positions. Let's see:\n\nTake Example 1's input row 4: [0,2,2,0,0,0,8,8,0,0]. The 8s are at positions 6 and 7. The 2s are at 1 and 2. The output for this row is [0,0,0,0,2,2,8,8,0,0]. So the 2s are moved right, passing through the zeros, until they are just before the 8s. So between positions 1-2 to 4-5. The zeros before the 2s are filled in from the left.\n\nSo the rule could be: For each row, separate the elements into two parts: 8s (fixed) and others (2s and zeros). Then, process the non-8 elements as a group, shifting them to the right as much as possible, maintaining their order. So for the non-8 elements, the 2s and zeros are shifted right, but their internal order is preserved.\n\nIn Example 1's row 1 input: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 8s are none. So the entire row is non-8 elements. So shifting them right would result in [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]? But in the output, the row becomes [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. Wait, that doesn't match. So perhaps the non-8 elements are shifted to the right, but the 2s are moved to the right within the row, but the zeros are filled in on the left. But in this case, the output's row 1 has 2s at positions 4 and 5, but the input's row 1 has them at 1 and 2. So shifting right by 3 positions. But why 3? There's space to shift them all the way to the end. Unless there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is split into segments between 8s, and within each segment, the 2s and zeros are shifted right. For example, in a row with no 8s, the entire row is a segment. Shift all 2s to the right, keeping their order, and zeros fill the left. So for row [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], shifting the 2s to the right would result in [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]. But the output in Example 1's row 1 is [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0], which is not shifted to the end. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try another approach. Let's look for the movement direction. In Example 0, the 2s moved down, but in Example 1, they moved right. Wait, that's confusing. There must be a different pattern.\n\nAnother possibility: The 2s are moving down and to the right, but the 8s are moving up. Or maybe the 8s are stationary and the 2s are moving towards them.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. Input has 8s in rows 1 and 2, and 2s in rows 6,7,8. The output moves the 2s up to rows 3,4,5, leaving rows 6,7,8 as zeros. So the 2s moved up three rows, but why? Unless the 8s act as a ceiling, and the 2s are moving up towards them? But in Example 0, the 8s are below the 2s, and the 2s moved down towards the 8s. So perhaps the 2s are moving towards the 8s, but the direction depends on the position. That seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the entire structure of the grid is being rotated or flipped. For instance, maybe the grid is flipped vertically. Let's check Example 0. The input's 2s are in rows 2 and 3 (assuming 0-based). If the grid is flipped vertically, those rows would move to the bottom. But the output has the 2s in rows 8 and 9. The original grid has 14 rows. Flipping would put row 2 at row 11 (14-2-1=11), but in the output, the 2s are at 8 and 9. So that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, the rows containing 2s are moved to the bottom, above any 8s. Let's see. In Example 0's input, the 2s are in rows 2 and 3, and 8s in rows 10 and 11. The output moves the 2s to rows 8 and 9, which are just above the 8s. So perhaps the 2s are moved down as far as possible but stopped before the 8s.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 8s are in row 4 and 5 (the input's row 4 and 5). The 2s are in rows 1,2,3,4. The output moves some 2s to the right, but also the rows containing 2s may have shifted. For example, the output's row 1 has 2s shifted to the right. Maybe the 2s in each row are shifted to the right, and then all the rows with 2s are moved down to just above the 8s.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation involves two steps: first, within each row, shift the 2s to the right as far as possible (without moving 8s), then move the rows containing 2s down to be just above the rows containing 8s.\n\nBut how does this fit with Example 0? Let's see:\n\nExample 0's input rows with 2s are 2 and 3. The 8s are in rows 10 and 11. So after shifting the 2s within their rows, then moving those rows down to just above the 8s. So rows 2 and 3 (after shifting) are moved to positions just before the 8s. But the 8s are at rows 10 and 11, so moving the 2 rows to 8 and 9. That matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s in rows 4 and 5 (assuming rows are 0-based). The rows with 2s are rows 1,2,3,4. So shifting those rows' 2s to the right, then moving those rows down to just above the 8s (rows 4 and 5). So the 2 rows would be placed in rows 3 and 4? But the output shows the 2 rows in rows 1,2,3,4. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows with 2s are sorted below the rows with 8s. But in Example 0, the 8s are in lower rows, and the 2s are moved to be just above them.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that all rows containing 2s are moved to be just above the rows containing 8s, maintaining their relative order, and within each row, the 2s are shifted to the right.\n\nIn Example 0, the input's 8s are in rows 10 and 11. The rows with 2s are 2 and 3. So moving rows 2 and 3 to be just above rows 10 and 11. That would place them at rows 8 and 9, which matches the output. Then, within each of those rows, the 2s are shifted to the right as much as possible.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 2: [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. Shifting 2s to the right would make [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2], but the output row 8 is [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. So that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the shifting is not to the right but just moving the rows down and keeping the 2s in their original positions. So maybe the shifting within the rows isn't happening. That doesn't fit with Example 1.\n\nExample 1's output shows that within the rows, the 2s are shifted to the right. For example, input row 1: [0,2,2,0,...] becomes [0,0,0,0,2,2, ...]. So there's a shift to the right. So the two steps might be: first, shift the 2s in each row to the right (like right-justified), then move the rows containing 2s to be just above the rows containing 8s.\n\nSo the process would be:\n\n1. For each row, shift the 2s to the right as much as possible, moving past zeros but stopped by 8s or the end of the row.\n\n2. Collect all rows that have 2s and move them down to be just above the rows that have 8s. The rows without 2s or 8s remain in their original order, filling the gaps.\n\nSo in Example 0:\n\n- Process each row by shifting 2s to the right. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row 2: [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. Shifting 2s to the right would result in [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2] (if the row length is 9, but the example shows 9 elements). Wait, the input row for Example 0 has 9 elements. Shifting right would move the 2s to the end. But the output for row 8 is [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0], which hasn't shifted. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm, this is getting me stuck. Let's look for another angle. Let's compare the input and output for each example again.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput:\n\nRows 2 and 3 have 2s.\n\nOutput:\n\nRows 8 and 9 have those 2s.\n\nThe 8s are in rows 10 and 11 in input and output.\n\nSo the 2s moved down 6 rows (from 2 to 8, assuming rows are 0-based). But why 6?\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput has 8s in rows 4 and 5 (output rows 4 and 5 same as input). The 2s are in rows 1,2,3,4. Output shows the 2s in rows 1,2,3,4, but shifted to the right.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput has 8s in rows 1 and 2. The 2s are in rows 6,7,8. Output moves them up to rows 3,4,5.\n\nSo in Example 2, the 2s move up by 3 rows.\n\nThis suggests that the 2s are moving towards the 8s. If 8s are below the 2s, the 2s move down. If 8s are above, the 2s move up. But how?\n\nWait, in Example 2, the 8s are in rows 1 and 2, and the 2s are in rows 6,7,8. So the 2s are below the 8s. In the output, the 2s are moved up to rows 3,4,5. So they moved up towards the 8s. But why would that happen?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are moving to the closest possible position near the 8s. But this doesn't make much sense.\n\nAnother approach: let's see the positions of 2s and 8s in the input and output.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\n2s are at:\n\nRow 2: [0,2,2,2,0,...]\n\nRow 3: [2,2,0,2,0,...]\n\n8s are at rows 10 and 11, columns 3 and 4.\n\nOutput:\n\n2s are at rows 8 and 9, same columns as before.\n\n8s are in same positions.\n\nSo the 2s have been moved down by 6 rows. The rows between input 2s and 8s are filled with zeros. So perhaps the 2s are moved down as much as possible, but stopped by the 8s. So the 2s fall down until they hit the 8s.\n\nBut why would they move down 6 rows? Because there are 6 rows between the original 2 rows and the 8 rows? Let's count. From row 2 to row 10 in the input: there are 8 rows (rows 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10). Wait, if input row indices are 0-based, then the distance from row 3 to row 10 is 7 rows. The output has the 2s at rows 8 and 9. So maybe the 2s are moved down as far as possible without overlapping the 8s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2's input, the 8s are in rows 1 and 2, and the 2s are in rows 6,7,8. The output moves the 2s up to rows 3,4,5, which is just below the 8s. So the 2s are moved up until they are just below the 8s.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: 2s are moved towards the 8s as much as possible, either down or up, and placed adjacent to them, with empty rows in between. But how is the direction determined? It depends on the position of the 8s relative to the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, all 2s are moved to the closest possible position to the 8s. If the 8s are below, move down; if above, move up.\n\nBut in Example 1, the 8s are in the same rows as some 2s (row 4 has both 2s and 8s). The output shifts those 2s to the right. So this complicates things.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input row 4: [0,2,2,0,0,0,8,8,0,0]. The 2s and 8s are in the same row. So in the output, the 2s are shifted to the right, next to the 8s. So the 2s are moved to the right as far as possible, but not overlapping the 8s.\n\nSo combining these observations: \n\n- For each row, the 2s are shifted to the right as much as possible, past zeros, but stopped by 8s or the end.\n\n- Then, all rows containing 2s are moved vertically to be as close as possible to the rows containing 8s. So if the 8s are below, the 2 rows are moved down to just above them. If 8s are above, the 2 rows are moved up to just below them. If 8s are in the same row, then the 2s are shifted within the row.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with all examples.\n\nExample 0:\n\nStep 1: Shift 2s to the right in their rows.\n\nRow 2: [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 shifted right \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2] (assuming 9 elements, but maybe the original row has 9 elements, so the shifted would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2] but the output row 8 is [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't match. So maybe the shifting to the right isn't part of the pattern. Hmm, perhaps the vertical movement is the only step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows containing 2s are moved vertically to be just above the rows with 8s, and their original order is preserved. Then, within those rows, the 2s are shifted to the right.\n\nBut how to explain Example 1.\n\nExample 1's input has 8s in rows 4 and 5. The rows with 2s are 1,2,3,4. Moving those rows down to be just above rows 4 and 5. But rows 4 and 5 already have 8s, so the 2 rows would be placed in rows 3 and 4. But the output's rows 1,2,3,4 have 2s. This is conflicting.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Maybe the correct approach is to think that for each column, the 2s are moved down as far as possible until they hit an 8 or another 2. So, similar to how blocks fall in Tetris.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input columns where there are 2s:\n\nTake column 1. In the input, there's a 2 in row 2 and 3. The output has them in row 8 and 9. So in between, there are zeros. So if the 2s fall down, they would fill the bottom of the column. But in Example 0, the 8s are in columns 3 and 4. So the 2s in column 1 can fall all the way to the bottom. But in the output, they're in rows 8 and 9, which are not the bottom. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire structure of 2s is moved down until it collides with the 8s. Like, the group of 2s is moved as a block downward. In Example 0, the 2s are in rows 2 and 3. The 8s are in rows 10 and 11. So moving the 2s down by 6 rows to rows 8 and 9, just above the 8s.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2s are in rows 6,7,8. The 8s are in rows 1 and 2. So moving the 2s up by 3 rows to rows 3,4,5, just below the 8s.\n\nSo the pattern is: the group of 2s (contiguous or not) is moved vertically as a whole towards the nearest 8s. If 8s are below, move down. If above, move up. And placed adjacent to the 8s.\n\nBut how to determine the direction? For Example 0, the 8s are below, so move down. Example 2, 8s are above, move up.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8s are in rows 4 and 5, and the 2s are in rows 1,2,3,4. So the nearest 8s are below, so move the 2s down. But how does that explain the output where the 2s are shifted right in the same rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows containing 2s are moved to be adjacent to the rows containing 8s, and within those rows, the 2s are shifted to the right as much as possible.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\n- Rows with 2s are moved down to just above the 8s (rows 10 and 11 \u2192 moved to 8 and 9).\n\n- Within those rows, the 2s are shifted to the right as much as possible. But in the output, the rows still have the 2s in the same positions. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows containing 2s are moved vertically to be next to the 8s, and within the columns of those rows, the 2s are shifted down.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Let's try to see if there's a pattern in the vertical movement.\n\nExample 0's input has 14 rows. Output moves the 2s from rows 2 and 3 to 8 and 9. That's a shift of 6 rows down.\n\nExample 2's input has 11 rows. The 2s are moved from rows 6,7,8 to 3,4,5. A shift of 3 rows up.\n\nExample 1's input has 9 rows. The 8s are in rows 4 and 5. The 2s are moved down to rows 1,2,3,4. So the rows with 2s are moved down to be just above the 8s. For example, row 1 in the input is moved down to row 1 in the output. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s and 8s are sorted such that all 8s are in their original positions, and the 2s are placed in the earliest possible rows after the 8s or before, depending on their position.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's think of the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nThe test input has 8s in rows 6 and 7 (assuming 0-based), columns 1 and 2.\n\nThe 2s are in rows 4,5,6,7 (columns 5,5-6,5-6,6).\n\nSo rows 4: [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,8,8,0,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,8,8,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 8s are in rows 6 and 7, columns 1 and 2.\n\nThe 2s are in columns 5,6, and 6 in rows 4,5,6,7.\n\nThe output should apply the same transformation as the examples.\n\nBased on Example 0 and 2, when 8s are below the 2s, the 2s are moved down as close as possible. But in the test input, the 2s are already in rows 4-7, with 8s in rows 6 and 7. So some 2s are in the same rows as 8s. For example, row 6 has both 8s and 2s. How would this be handled?\n\nIn Example 1, the input had 8s and 2s in the same row, and the 2s were shifted to the right. So perhaps the same happens here.\n\nSo for each row that has both 2s and 8s, shift the 2s to the right as much as possible, moving past zeros but stopping before 8s. Then, any rows with 2s (after shifting) are moved to be just above the rows with 8s.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nRows with 8s: 6 and 7.\n\nRows with 2s: 4,5,6,7.\n\nProcessing each row:\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0] \u2192 no 8s. Shift 2s to the right \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0]. But the output might have the 2 shifted to the end.\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 no 8s. Shift right \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2].\n\nRow 6: [0,8,8,0,0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 has 8s. So shift non-8 elements to the right. The non-8 elements are [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0] (but the 8s are in positions 1 and 2). So the row would split into two segments: before 8s, and after. The non-8 elements before 8s are [0], and after are [0,0,2,2,0,0,0]. So shift the after part to the right. So the row becomes [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,2,2].\n\nRow 7: [0,8,8,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]. The non-8 elements after 8s are [0,0,0,2,0,0,0]. Shift to the right \u2192 [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,2].\n\nNow, after shifting, the 2s are in rows 4,5,6,7. Now, the rows with 2s are 4,5,6,7. The 8s are in rows 6 and 7. So according to the pattern from Example 0 and 2, these rows should be moved to be just above the 8s. Since the 8s are in rows 6 and 7, the 2 rows (4,5,6,7) should be moved down to just above them. Wait, but rows 6 and 7 already have 8s and 2s. So maybe the rows that have only 2s (after shifting) are moved down to be above the 8s.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Let me think about what the correct output would be based on the examples.\n\nIn the test input, after shifting:\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow 6: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow 7: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nThen, the rows with 2s (rows 4,5,6,7) are moved to be just above the 8s. But the 8s are in rows 6 and 7. So moving the 2 rows to be above rows 6 and 7. But rows 6 and 7 are already occupied by the 8s and shifted 2s. So perhaps the rows 4 and 5 (which have only 2s) are moved down to rows 6 and 7, but since those rows have 8s, they would be placed just above. Wait, this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, after shifting the 2s to the right, the rows with 2s (4,5,6,7) are moved down to be just above the 8s. Since the 8s are in rows 6 and 7, the 2 rows are moved to rows 4 and 5. But that's where they already are. So maybe the rows that contain both 2s and 8s (rows 6 and 7) are left in place, and the other 2 rows (4 and 5) are moved down to just above the 8s.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's look for another approach. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the answer is to shift the 2s to the right in their rows and then move the rows containing 2s to be just above the 8s.\n\nFor the test input, the rows with 2s after shifting are 4,5,6,7. The 8s are in rows 6 and 7. So rows 6 and 7 have both 2s and 8s after shifting. The other 2 rows (4 and 5) are moved down to be just above the 8s (rows 6 and 7). So rows 4 and 5 become rows 6 and 7, but original rows 6 and 7 are already there. So this would overlap. Therefore, perhaps the entire block of 2s (rows 4-7) are moved down to be just above the 8s. But since the 8s are in rows 6 and 7, there's no space below. So they have to be moved up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are moved down until they are just above the 8s. In the test input, the 8s are in rows 6 and 7. So the 2s in rows 4 and 5 can move down to row 6 and 7, but those rows have 8s. So instead, they are moved to the first available rows above the 8s. But that would be rows 4 and 5. But they are already there. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct output is that the 2s are shifted to the right in their rows, and then the rows with 2s are reordered to be just above the rows with 8s. So in the test input, the rows with 8s are 6 and 7. The rows with 2s after shifting are 4,5,6,7. So the rows with only 2s (4,5) are moved to be just above the 8s (rows 6 and 7). So rows 4 and 5 become rows 6 and 7, and the original rows 6 and 7 (which now have 8s and shifted 2s) are moved down. But this would require shifting other rows as well.\n\nBut according to the training examples, the output's structure for Example 0 and 2 shows that the 2s are moved vertically to be close to the 8s. So in the test input, the 2s that are above the 8s (rows 4 and 5) would be moved down to be just above the 8s. The 2s that are in the same rows as 8s (rows 6 and 7) would stay in those rows but shifted to the right.\n\nSo the output would have the shifted rows 4 and 5 moved down to rows 6 and 7, but the 8s are already there. So this may require that the 8s' rows are left as is, and the 2 rows are placed just above.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and the examples, the likely output for the test input is that the 2s in rows 4,5,6,7 are shifted to the right within their rows and then moved down to be just above the 8s. So the 8s are in rows 6 and 7, so the 2 rows would be in rows 4 and 5, but shifted right. Let me try to construct the output.\n\nAfter shifting right:\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0] \u2192 shifted\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow 6: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow 7: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nThen, moving the rows with 2s to be just above the 8s. The 8s are in rows 6 and 7, so the 2 rows (4,5,6,7) are moved down to be just above. But rows 6 and 7 already have 8s. So perhaps the rows 4 and 5 (only 2s) are moved down to rows 6 and 7. But then what happens to the original rows 6 and 7?\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time I've invested and the examples, I think the pattern is:\n\n1. Shift 2s in each row to the right as far as possible, moving past zeros, but stopped by 8s.\n\n2. Move the rows containing 2s to be just above the rows containing 8s, maintaining the order of the rows.\n\nSo for the test input, after shifting:\n\nRows 4,5,6,7 have 2s.\n\nThe 8s are in rows 6 and 7.\n\nSo the rows with 2s are moved to be just above rows 6 and 7. So rows 4 and 5 are moved down to rows 6 and 7, and rows 6 and 7 (original) are moved down to rows 8 and 9.\n\nBut this would require the other rows to shift up. Alternatively, the rows with 2s are placed above the 8s, pushing the other rows up.\n\nBut according to the training examples, the output often has the 2 rows moved to the bottom part. So maybe the test output would have the shifted 2 rows moved down to be just above the 8s.\n\nIn the test input, the 8s are in rows 6 and 7. So after moving the 2 rows down, they would be in rows 4 and 5 (if they were above), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the rows with 2s after shifting are moved to the bottom of the grid, above the 8s.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given the time, I'll proceed to write the test output based on shifting the 2s to the right and moving them down.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, there's a transformation from the input to the output. Let's start by comparing each example's input and output.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has some 2s and 8s. The output seems to move the 2s down. Like, the third row in the input is [0,2,2,2,0,...], and in the output, that row moves down to the eighth row. Similarly, the fourth row [2,2,0,2,0,...] moves to the ninth row in the output. The 8s in rows 10 and 11 of the input stay in the same place in the output. The rest of the rows are zeros. So maybe the 2s are moving down, while the 8s stay put? But wait, how exactly?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input has some 2s and 8s. The output shifts the 2s to the right. For instance, the second row in the input starts with 0,2,2,0... and in the output, it's shifted to columns 4 and 5. Similarly, the third row [2,2,2,0...] becomes [0,0,0,2,2,2...]. The 8s in row 4 and 5 of the input are still in the same columns (columns 6 and 7) in the output. So maybe the 2s are moving right and down, but the 8s are staying?\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the 8s are in rows 1 and 2, and in the output, they remain there. The 2s are in lower rows. The output moves some 2s up. For instance, input rows 6 and 7 have 2s, which in the output are moved to rows 3 and 4. So maybe the pattern is that 2s \"fall\" down, but 8s are fixed. But how do they move? Let's think of it like gravity. Maybe the numbers 2 and 8 represent different objects. 2s are subject to gravity (they fall down) while 8s are fixed. But wait in Example 0, the 2s in the input are higher up and then in the output, they are lower. Similarly in Example 1, the 2s shift to the right. Hmm, maybe not just falling straight down.\n\nWait another approach: Maybe the transformation is rotating the positions of the non-zero elements. But the examples don't seem to be rotation. Let's look again.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the original input has 2s in rows 2 and 3. The output moves those to rows 8 and 9. So that's a shift down by 6 rows. But the 8s are in rows 10 and 11, which in the output are still rows 10 and 11. So the 8s didn't move. So maybe 8s are stationary, and 2s are moved down as far as possible. But how far?\n\nIn Example 0, the 2s in rows 2 and 3. In the output, they're in rows 8 and 9. Let's see how much space there is below them. The input has 14 rows. The original rows with 2s are at positions 2 and 3 (0-based or 1-based? Let's check the counts. For Example 0's input, the rows are 14 in total. The output moves the 2s to rows 8 and 9 (if starting from 0, that's index 8 and 9). So in the input, the 2s are in rows 2 and 3 (0-based). The output moves them down by 6 rows. But why? Because maybe they fall down until they hit the 8s or the bottom.\n\nWait, let's check Example 0's input. The 2s in rows 2 and 3. Below them are all zeros except the 8s at rows 10 and 11. So when moving the 2s down, they would fall until they reach the 8s. The distance between row 3 (input) and the 8s is rows 4-10 (assuming input's 8s are at rows 10 and 11). Wait, maybe the 2s fall down as far as possible without overlapping existing non-zero (2 or 8) elements. So in Example 0, the 2s in rows 2 and 3 can fall down until they reach the 8s. Let's see: The 8s are in rows 10 and 11. The 2s from row 3 would need to move down to row 8 and 9. How many steps? Let's see how much space is between them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are moved down to the bottom of the grid, but stopped by other non-zero elements. So for each 2, we move it down as much as possible until it hits another non-zero (either 2 or 8), and then stack them there. But how does this work in Example 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire group of 2s is moved down as a block until they can't go further. Let's take Example 0's input. The 2s are in rows 2 and 3. The group would move down as much as possible. Below them are zeros until rows 10 and 11, which have 8s. So the 2s would move down to the rows just above the 8s. How many rows are between row 3 (original) and row 10 (8s)? Let's count: rows 4,5,6,7,8,9. So from row 3, moving down 6 rows would land at row 9. But the output's 2s are in rows 8 and 9. Hmm, maybe each individual cell moves down as much as possible. So for each cell with a 2, move it down until it hits a non-zero cell or the bottom. But since the 8s are in rows 10 and 11, the 2s can move down into the empty rows below them.\n\nWait in Example 0's output, the 2s that were in rows 2 and 3 (input) are now in rows 8 and 9 (output). The 8s are in rows 10 and 11. So the 2s are placed just above the 8s. So maybe the 2s fall down until they hit the 8s. But how does this movement happen? For example, in Example 1's input, the 2s are in the left part, and in the output, they are shifted to the right. Wait, but the output shows 2s moved right, not down. Hmm, maybe I need to re-examine.\n\nWait in Example 1's input, the first few rows have 2s, and in the output, those 2s are shifted to the right. For instance, the second row input is [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and the output shifts this to columns 4 and 5. So moving 3 positions to the right. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are moving to the rightmost possible position in their row, avoiding 8s. But in the output of Example 1, the 8s are in the same columns as before. The 2s in the input are in columns 1 and 2 (assuming 0-based), and in the output, they are shifted to columns 4 and 5. So perhaps they are moving to the right as far as possible in their row, but avoiding overlapping with existing 8s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different pattern. Let's look for another angle.\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to have the 2s and 8s arranged in a way that they are sorted by their type. 8s stay where they are, and 2s are moved to the bottom. But in Example 0, the 8s are in the lower rows, and the 2s are moved down to be just above them. Wait, in Example 0's output, the 2s are in rows 8 and 9, and the 8s are in rows 10 and 11. So maybe 2s are moved to the lowest possible position above the 8s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s and 8s represent different layers, with 8s being fixed and 2s moving down through empty space until they hit a block (another 2 or 8). So each 2 in a column moves down as much as possible. Let's test this for the examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has a group of 2s starting in row 2. Let's take a column where there's a 2. For example, column 1 in row 2 has a 2. Below that, in the input, there are zeros until row 10. So in the output, that 2 would fall down to the bottom of the column, but in the output, it's in row 8. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe the movement isn't per column but per block. Maybe the entire blocks of 2s fall down as a group until they hit another block (either 2s or 8s). Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2s are in rows 2 and 3. If this block is moved down until it hits the 8s, then the distance between the bottom of the 2 block (row 3) and the top of the 8s (row 10) is 6 rows. So moving the block down 6 rows would place the original row 2 at row 8, row 3 at row 9. Which matches the output. So maybe the blocks of 2s are moved down as much as possible to be just above the 8s.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8s are in row 4 and 5 (input) in columns 6 and 7. The 2s are above them. The output shows the 2s shifted to the right. Wait, maybe the 2s are moved to the right as much as possible, but not overlapping the 8s. So in Example 1, the 2s in the input are on the left side. The output shifts them to the right, possibly to the right edge of their row, but avoiding the 8s. For example, in row 4 of the input, there's a 8 in columns 6 and 7. So the 2s in row 4 (columns 1 and 2) shift right to columns 4 and 5, avoiding overlapping with 8s. That's what the output shows.\n\nBut how do these two patterns (shifting down and shifting right) coexist? Maybe there's a priority. For example, first shift down, then shift right. Or maybe the blocks move in a specific direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that all the 2s are moved to the right and down as far as possible, while 8s remain fixed, and 2s can't pass through 8s.\n\nWait in Example 2's input, the 2s are in lower rows (rows 6,7,8). The output moves them up to rows 3,4,5. Wait that's the opposite. Hmm. So maybe this contradicts the previous idea.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 2's input and output. The input has 8s in rows 1 and 2 (columns 3 and 4). Then in the lower part, rows 6,7,8 have 2s. The output moves those 2s up to rows 3,4,5, right below the 8s. So the 2s are moved up to be just below the 8s. But that's the opposite of what happened in Example 0. So this complicates things.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 2s are above the 8s and move down to be just above them. In Example 2, the 2s are below the 8s and move up to be just below them? That doesn't make sense. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are grouped into contiguous blocks, and each block is moved either down or to the right until they hit another block (of 2s or 8s). But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire grid is rotated or mirrored. For example, in Example 0's input and output, the 2s are moved down, but maybe it's a vertical flip. Let's check. The input's 2s are in rows 2 and 3. The output's 2s are in rows 8 and 9. The total rows are 14. If it's a vertical flip, then row 2 would map to row 11 (14-1 -2=11?), but that doesn't fit. So no.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the non-zero elements (2 and 8) are sorted such that 8s are placed first (i.e., they stay in their positions), and then 2s are placed below them, as low as possible. But in Example 0, the 8s are in lower rows, so the 2s can't be placed lower. So the 2s are placed just above the 8s.\n\nIn Example 2, the 8s are in higher rows, so the 2s are moved up to be just below them. Wait, but in Example 2's output, the 2s are in rows 3,4,5, which are below the 8s in rows 1 and 2. So maybe the 2s are moved up as close as possible to the 8s. But why? This contradicts Example 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are moved towards the 8s, either up or down, depending on their initial position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are moving towards the nearest 8s. But in Example 0, the 2s are above the 8s and move down. In Example 2, the 2s are below the 8s and move up. That way, they end up adjacent to the 8s. But how does that happen in the other examples?\n\nWait in Example 1, the 8s are in rows 4 and 5, columns 6 and 7. The 2s are in rows 0,1,2,3,4. The output shifts the 2s to the right. For example, the 2s in row 1 (columns 1 and 2) are shifted to columns 4 and 5. So maybe they move right towards the 8s. The 8s are in columns 6 and 7. So moving the 2s from columns 1-2 to 4-5, getting closer to the 8s. Then maybe the 2s are moving towards the 8s in their row.\n\nBut in Example 0, the 2s move down towards the 8s. In Example 1, the 2s move right towards the 8s. So the direction depends on where the 8s are relative to the 2s. That seems possible. So the pattern is that each group of 2s moves in the direction towards the nearest 8s (either down, right, etc.), but how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, the movement is such that the 2s are attracted to the 8s and move as close as possible. For example, in Example 0, the 8s are below the 2s, so the 2s fall down to be just above. In Example 1, the 8s are to the right of the 2s, so the 2s shift right. In Example 2, the 8s are above the 2s, so the 2s move up to be just below.\n\nBut how is this movement quantified? Let's take Example 2: the 8s are in rows 1 and 2. The 2s are in rows 6,7,8. The output moves them up to rows 3,4,5. So they move up by 3 rows. The distance between the 8s (row 2) and the original 2s (row 6) is 4 rows. So moving them up by 3 rows brings them to row 3 (6-3=3?), no. Wait original row 6 (0-based?) would be row 6. If moved up by 3 rows, it becomes row 3. So that's the case. But why 3 rows? Because maybe the 2s can't overlap with the 8s, so they move as close as possible without overlapping.\n\nBut how do we determine the direction and distance for each group?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s and 8s are being merged or combined in some way. But looking at the examples, it's more like the 2s are moving towards the 8s.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the positions of the 2s and 8s in each example's input and output. For Example 0, in the input, the 2s are at (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,3). The 8s are at (10,3), (10,4), (11,3), (11,4). In the output, the 2s are moved down to rows 8 and 9, same columns, and the 8s remain. So the movement is strictly downward. For Example 1, the 2s in columns 1-2 move to columns 4-5 in the same rows. So movement to the right. For Example 2, the 2s in lower rows move up to higher rows. So the direction varies.\n\nWait, perhaps the 2s are moving towards the 8s along the path that requires the least movement. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are moving in a particular direction (like down or right) until they hit a barrier (8s or another 2). But in Example 1, the 2s move right. In Example 0, down. In Example 2, up. So direction varies. This is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the 2s are being sorted in a way relative to the 8s. For example, in Example 0, the 8s are at the bottom, so the 2s are moved down to be just above them. In Example 2, the 8s are at the top, so the 2s are moved up to be just below them. But how is that possible? Because in the first case, the 2s are above the 8s and move down. In the second case, the 2s are below the 8s and move up. So maybe the 2s are moved to be as close as possible to the 8s, regardless of direction.\n\nBut then, how is the movement direction determined? For each group of 2s, find the nearest 8 group and move towards them. That could be the case. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the 8s are below the 2s. The 2s are in higher rows. So they move down to be adjacent.\n\nIn Example 2, the 8s are above the 2s. So the 2s move up to be adjacent.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8s are in the same rows as some of the 2s (row 4). So perhaps the 2s move horizontally towards the 8s. The 8s in row 4 are in columns 6 and 7. The 2s in row 4 (input) are in columns 1 and 2. So moving right to columns 4 and 5 brings them closer to the 8s. That makes sense.\n\nSo the pattern could be: For each group of 2s, move them towards the nearest group of 8s along the vertical or horizontal axis, whichever is closer. If the nearest 8s are in a different row, move vertically (up or down) until they are in the same row. Then move horizontally (left or right) towards the 8s. Or perhaps the movement is in the direction that brings them closest, combining vertical and horizontal movement.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is determined by the majority direction. For example, if the 8s are to the right and below, the 2s move diagonally. But since the movement in the examples is either vertical or horizontal, perhaps it's one direction at a time.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but let's try applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nThe input has 8s in rows 6 and 7 (assuming rows start at 0?), columns 1 and 2. The 2s are in rows 4 (column 5), row5 (columns 5,6), row6 (columns5,6), and row7 (column6). The 8s are in rows 6 and7, columns1-2. So the 2s are to the right of the 8s. So according to the pattern, perhaps the 2s should move left towards the 8s. Or perhaps move down/up.\n\nWait, the 8s are in rows 6 and 7, columns 1-2. The 2s are in rows 4-7, columns5-6. So the nearest 8s are in the same columns but lower rows. So the 2s should move down towards them. Let's see. However, moving down would mean the 2s are in rows lower than 7, but the 8s are in rows 6-7. So maybe the 2s can't move down because the 8s are in the way. Alternatively, the 2s could move left towards the 8s.\n\nAlternatively, the direction of movement is determined by the position of the 8s relative to the 2s. The 8s are in the same columns (1-2), but the 2s are in columns5-6. So the 8s are to the left. So the 2s should move left towards the 8s.\n\nLooking at Example 1's movement, when the 8s were to the right, the 2s moved right. But in the test input, the 8s are to the left of the 2s, so perhaps the 2s move left.\n\nAlternatively, the movement is always to the right and down. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the 8s are to the right of the 2s, and the 2s move right. In the test case, the 8s are to the left, so maybe the 2s move left. Let's see.\n\nThe test input's 2s are in columns5-6. The 8s are in columns1-2. So moving left would shift them towards columns1-2.\n\nBut in the test input's output, how would this look?\n\nLooking at the test input's 2s:\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column5.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 columns5-6.\n\nRow6: [0,8,8,0,0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 columns5-6, but row6 also has 8s in columns1-2.\n\nRow7: [0,8,8,0,0,0,2,0,0,0] \u2192 column6.\n\nSo the 2s are in columns5-6 of rows4-7, except row7 has a 2 in column6.\n\nThe 8s are in rows6-7, columns1-2.\n\nIf the 2s need to move left towards the 8s, then they would shift left as much as possible. However, they have to avoid overlapping with existing 8s or other 2s.\n\nIn row6 of the input, there are 2s in columns5-6 and 8s in 1-2. If the 2s shift left, they would move towards columns1-2. But the 8s are there. So they can't overlap. So perhaps they move left until they hit the 8s. So the 2s in row6, columns5-6 would move left as far as possible. The 8s are in columns1-2. The space to the left of the 2s is columns0-4. So the 2s can shift left by 3 positions (from 5 to 2, for example). Let's see:\n\nOriginal positions in row6: columns5-6 (2s). To move left, they'd shift to columns2-3. Because moving left by 3 steps. But why 3 steps? Because perhaps there's space. Let's check:\n\nRow6 in the input is: [0,8,8,0,0,2,2,0,0,0]. So columns0-9.\n\nThe 2s are in columns5-6. To move left, the first available spot would be after the 8s. So the 8s are in columns1-2. So columns3-4 are empty. The 2s can shift left to fill columns3-4. So moving left by 2 steps (from 5-6 to 3-4). But how does that work with the other 2s in the same row?\n\nAlternatively, each group of 2s moves as a block. For example, in row6, the two 2s in columns5-6 could shift left by 2 columns to columns3-4, where there's space. Similarly, the 2s in row5 (columns5-6) could shift left to columns3-4. The 2 in row4, column5 would shift left to column3. The 2 in row7, column6 would shift left to column4.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nRow4: column3: 2.\n\nRow5: columns3-4: 2,2.\n\nRow6: columns3-4: 2,2.\n\nRow7: column4: 2.\n\nBut also, the 8s are in rows6-7, columns1-2. So these shifts would not interfere.\n\nLet's see how this fits with the examples. For instance, in Example 1, the 2s moved right. So in the test case, the 2s move left towards the 8s.\n\nIf this is the case, then the test input's output would have the 2s shifted left to columns3-4 in rows4-7.\n\nBut let's check the test input:\n\nOriginal 2 positions:\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,...]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0...]\n\nRow6: [0,8,8,0,0,2,2,0...]\n\nRow7: [0,8,8,0,0,0,2,0...]\n\nShifting left for the 2s in each row:\n\nRow4's 2 is in column5. The leftmost possible without overlapping 8s or other 2s would be to column3 (since columns0-2 are 0 except for 8s in rows6-7).\n\nWait, but in row4, there are no 8s. So the 2 in row4, column5 can move left as much as possible. The columns to the left are 0-4. So can it move to column0? But that depends on other rows. Wait, maybe each row is considered individually. So in row4, the 2 can move left to column0, but perhaps they need to align with other 2s.\n\nAlternatively, the movement is such that all 2s in a contiguous block move as a group towards the nearest 8s. Let's think of the test input's 2s as forming a sort of shape. The 2s are in a diagonal:\n\nRow4: column5.\n\nRow5: columns5-6.\n\nRow6: columns5-6.\n\nRow7: column6.\n\nThe nearest 8s are in rows6-7, columns1-2, which are to the left. So the entire group of 2s would shift left as much as possible.\n\nIn row4, the 2 can shift left to column0 (if possible), but there's no 8s blocking. But maybe they need to shift as a group. For example, the entire group moves left by three columns. So:\n\nRow4's 2 (column5) moves left by 3 \u2192 column2.\n\nRow5's 2s (5-6) \u2192 columns2-3.\n\nRow6's 2s (5-6) \u2192 columns2-3.\n\nRow7's 2 (6) \u2192 column3.\n\nBut in row6, columns1-2 are 8s. So shifting to columns2-3 would be adjacent to the 8s. That could make sense.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nRow4: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,8,8,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,8,8,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but in row6, columns2-3 are 2s. But the 8s are in columns1-2. So column2 is occupied by 8. So the 2s can't shift left into column2. This is a problem. So the original 2s in row6, columns5-6 can't shift left into columns3-4, because columns0-2 are occupied by 8s (columns1-2) and zeros. So maybe in row6, the 2s can only shift left into columns3-4, since columns0-2 are occupied.\n\nSo row6's 2s move from 5-6 to 3-4. That's possible, as those columns are empty.\n\nRow4: 2 moves from 5 to 3.\n\nRow5: 2s from 5-6 to 3-4.\n\nRow6: 2s from5-6 to3-4.\n\nRow7: 2 from6 to4.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,8,8,0,0,2,2 \u2192 wait no. Original row6 has 8s in 1-2, then zeros, then 2s in5-6. Shifting left by 2 would place them at3-4.\n\nSo row6 after shift: [0,8,8,2,2,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow7: original is [0,8,8,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]. Shifting the 2 from6 to4 \u2192 column4.\n\nSo row7 becomes [0,8,8,0,2,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut we need to check if there's any overlap with existing numbers. In row6, columns3-4 are zeros, so moving the 2s there is allowed. The 8s are in 1-2.\n\nSo the final output for the test case would have the 2s shifted left to columns3-4 in rows4-7.\n\nLet me check if this aligns with the examples' patterns.\n\nIn Example 1, the 2s were shifted right to be closer to the 8s. So if the 8s are to the right, they move right. If to the left, move left. \n\nThus, applying this pattern to the test input would result in the 2s shifting left to be closer to the 8s in columns1-2. The 8s remain in their original positions.\n\nTherefore, the test input's output would have the 2s shifted left as much as possible, without overlapping the 8s. The rows with 2s would be adjusted accordingly.",
