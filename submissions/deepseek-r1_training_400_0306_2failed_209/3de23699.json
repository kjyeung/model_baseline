        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. The task is to take the input grids and produce an output grid based on some transformation. Let's look at the training examples to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 7x7 grid. The output is a 3x3 grid. Looking at the input, there are numbers 4 and 2. The output seems to have 4s arranged in a certain pattern. Let me check where the 4s and 2s are in the input. The input has 4s in positions (1,1), (1,5), (5,1), (5,5). The 2s are in the middle rows. The output is a 3x3 grid where the top row is [0,4,0], middle is [4,4,4], and bottom is [0,4,4]. Hmm. Maybe it's taking the non-zero numbers and combining them in some way. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input is a 12x9 grid. Output is 3x5. The input has 3s and 2s. The output has 3s. For example, the first row of output is [0,3,3,0,0]. Maybe the output is formed by combining the non-zero elements from certain rows or columns?\n\nWait, perhaps it's a matter of collapsing rows. Let me check. For Example 0, the input rows have 4s in rows 1 and 5. The output rows might be combining these. The middle row of the output is all 4s. Maybe it's taking the sum or the maximum of certain positions. Alternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the central parts of the input where the numbers are. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking for symmetry. In Example 0, the input is symmetric along both the vertical and horizontal axes. The output is smaller but also symmetric. Maybe the output is a condensed version where each cell represents a quadrant or section of the input. For instance, each output cell could be the maximum value in a certain region of the input.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 4s are at positions (1,1), (1,5), (5,1), (5,5). The output has 4s around. The middle row of the output is all 4s. Maybe it's taking the maximum from each corresponding section. Let's see: the input's 4s are in four corners if we look at the central part. The output's first row is 0,4,0. Middle is 4s. Bottom is 0,4,4. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output: the first row is [0,3,3,0,0]. The input's 3s are in rows 1 and 5 (if the input is 12 rows, but maybe the key is to look for the non-zero elements in specific positions. Alternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking non-zero elements from each column, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from each layer of the input, collapsing them into rows. For example, in Example 0, the input has 4s in certain positions and 2s in others. The output might be combining these layers. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a result of \"folding\" the input grid. For instance, the input is mirrored, and the output takes the sum or maximum from the mirrored parts. Let's see. In Example 0, the input is symmetric across the middle row and column. The output is a 3x3 grid. If we split the input into quadrants and combine, maybe? For example, the top-left quadrant of the input (assuming the middle is row 3 and column 3) would be rows 0-2 and columns 0-2. But the output doesn't directly match that.\n\nAnother angle: the output's dimensions are smaller than the input. Maybe the number of rows and columns in the output depends on the positions of non-zero elements. For example, in Example 0, the input's non-zero elements are spread in rows 1,2,3,4,5. But the output is 3 rows. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the minimal bounding box that contains all non-zero elements and then applying some transformation. For instance, in Example 0, the non-zero elements are in a diamond shape. The output could be a rotated or transformed version. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, the numbers in the output are the same as the numbers in the input. So 4, 3, 6, 8 appear in the outputs. So the transformation isn't changing the numbers, just their positions.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input: it's a 14x14 grid. Output is 4x4. The input has 6s and 8s. The output has 6s. So maybe the output is combining certain layers. For example, 6 appears in rows 5 and 10, maybe those layers are combined into the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row in the output corresponds to a pair of symmetric rows in the input. For example, in Example 0's input, rows 1 and 5 are mirrored. The output rows might be combining these. The output has three rows. The input has rows 0-6. Rows 1 and 5, 2 and 4, and row 3. So maybe the output rows are combining these pairs.\n\nFor Example 0, the output rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,4,0] could be combining rows 1 and 5. The input rows 1 and 5 have 4s in positions 1 and 5. If we add or take max, perhaps. But the output is 3 elements. Maybe the columns are being combined similarly.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the maximum (or sum) of each quadrant. For example, in Example 0's input, which is 7x7 (odd size), the center is at (3,3). The output is 3x3. Each output cell could correspond to a 3x3 area in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a center-cropped version. For instance, in Example 0, the input is 7x7. The output is 3x3. The center 3x3 of the input is:\n\n[0,0,0,2,0,0,0] (row 2)\n[0,0,2,2,2,0,0] (row3)\n[0,0,0,2,2,0,0] (row4)\n\nBut the output isn't the same as this. The output has 4s, which are from rows 1 and 5, not the center. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is capturing the non-zero elements that are in \"arms\" extending from the center. For example, in Example 0, the 4s are at the four corners of the input. The output's 4s are arranged in a cross. Maybe the output is combining the values from the four corners and the center.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output consists of the non-zero elements from the input, arranged in a way that their positions are adjusted based on their original positions. For example, taking the vertical and horizontal positions of non-zero elements and collapsing them into a smaller grid.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output dimensions. In Example 0, input is 7x7, output 3x3. 7/3 \u2248 2.33. Maybe each output cell represents a 2x2 or 3x3 area. For instance, 7 divided into 3 parts would have some overlap. But how?\n\nAnother approach: in the output, the numbers are arranged in a way that they form a kind of diamond or cross. For example, in Example 0's output, there's a cross of 4s. The input's 4s are at the four edges. Maybe the output is a condensed cross pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has 8s and 4s. The output is 4x8. The output rows have 8s in positions that might correspond to the positions in the input. For example, the first output row is [0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0]. In the input, 8s are in rows 1 and 6. Maybe the output is combining rows from the input where the 8s appear.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be constructed by taking the non-zero elements from certain layers of the input. For instance, in Example 0, the 4s form a layer around the center 2s. The output is combining these layers. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of the input as having multiple layers of numbers. For example, in Example 0, the 4s are on the outer layer, and the 2s form a cross in the center. The output might be combining these layers. The output's first row has a 4, which could be from the 4s, and the middle row has all 4s. Maybe the output is the sum of the layers, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking each non-zero element and moving it towards the center in some way. For example, the 4s in the input are at positions (1,1) and (1,5). If we collapse the columns towards the center, maybe they end up in the same row in the output.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the number of non-zero elements in each row and column. For example, in Example 0, the input rows 1 and 5 have two 4s each, and the middle rows have 2s. The output rows have 3 elements. Maybe each output row combines two input rows. For example, rows 1 and 5 are combined into the first output row, rows 2 and 4 into the second, and row3 is the third. Let's check:\n\nInput rows 1 and 5:\n\nRow1: [0,4,0,0,0,4,0]\nRow5: [0,4,0,0,0,4,0]\nIf combined by taking max, the combined row would be [0,4,0,0,0,4,0]. But the output's first row is [0,4,0], which is shorter. So maybe the middle elements are taken. Or perhaps columns are collapsed similarly.\n\nAlternatively, for each output row, it's combining two input rows by taking the maximum from each column pair. For example, in a 7x7 input, each output column is the max of two input columns. Let's see:\n\nFor Example 0, input has 7 columns. The output has 3 columns. So maybe columns 0-1 are merged into column 0, 2-4 into column1, and 5-6 into column2. Then, for each merged column, take the maximum value.\n\nBut let's test:\n\nOriginal columns (indices 0-6):\n\nRow1 columns: 0,4,0,0,0,4,0.\n\nIf merged into 3 columns:\n\nCol0: max(0,4) =4? But output first row is [0,4,0]. Wait, maybe the merging is different. Maybe split into left, center, right. Columns 0-2, 3, 4-6. Then:\n\nRow1: columns 0-2: 0,4,0 \u2192 max is4. Column3:0. Columns4-6:0,4,0 \u2192 max4. So merged row would be [4,0,4]. But the output's first row is [0,4,0]. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this approach might not be right.\n\nLooking at the output dimensions:\n\nExample 0: input 7x7 \u2192 output 3x3.\n\nExample1: input 12x9 \u2192 output3x5.\n\nExample2: input14x14 \u2192 output4x4.\n\nExample3: input18x18 \u2192 output4x8.\n\nTest input is 19x19 (19 rows, each with 19 elements). So perhaps the output dimensions are determined by the positions of non-zero elements. For example, the number of rows in the output is the number of unique non-zero rows divided by 2 or something. But in Example0, input has non-zero rows 1,2,3,4,5. Output has 3 rows. So 5 rows \u21923 output rows, which doesn't directly divide.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows correspond to the middle rows of the input. For Example0, the middle row is row3. The output has 3 rows. Maybe the output is the middle three rows of the input, but processed. But in Example0's input, the middle three rows (2,3,4) are:\n\n[0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,2,2,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,2,2,0,0]\n\nBut the output's rows are [0,4,0], [4,4,4], [0,4,4], which have 4s, but the input middle rows have 2s. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, but the output in Example0 has 4s, which come from the input rows 1 and 5. So perhaps the output is combining the outer rows (with 4s) and inner rows (with 2s) into a new structure. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the non-zero elements from the input and arranging them in a compressed grid where each cell is the maximum value from a certain area. For example, each output cell could represent a 3x3 area in the input, but that doesn't fit Example0's output.\n\nAnother thought: looking for rotations or reflections. The output might be a rotated version of the input's non-zero elements. For example, in Example0, the 4s are arranged in a diamond shape around the center, and the output's 4s form a cross. Rotating the diamond 45 degrees might give the cross. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is the transpose of some part of the input. But in Example0, the input rows 1 and 5 have 4s in columns 1 and5. The output has 4s in the middle row, which would correspond to columns in the input. But transpose would make rows into columns.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking the non-zero elements from the input and centering them. For example, the 4s in Example0's input are in the corners, but in the output they form a cross in the center.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a kind of \"contour\" map where each level of number is represented. For example, the highest numbers form the outer layers. But in Example0, 4 is higher than 2. So the 4s would form the outer layer. The output for Example0 is a cross of 4s, which could be the contour of the 4s. But how does that fit with the input?\n\nAlternatively, the output is the maximum value along each diagonal. For Example0, the main diagonals have 4s and 2s. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the result of some kind of convolution. For example, applying a kernel that detects certain patterns. But without knowing the kernel, this is hard.\n\nWait, looking at the input and output for Example0 again. The input's 4s are at positions (1,1), (1,5), (5,1), (5,5). The output's 4s are arranged as:\n\nRow0: [0,4,0]\n\nRow1: [4,4,4]\n\nRow2: [0,4,4]\n\nSo the 4s form a kind of T-shape. Maybe each 4 in the input contributes to certain positions in the output. For example, the input's 4 at (1,1) could contribute to the output's (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example1's output:\n\n[0,3,3,0,0]\n\n[0,3,3,0,3]\n\n[3,0,0,3,0]\n\nThe input's 3s are in rows1 and5, columns1 and7. The output's first row has 3s in positions 1 and2. Maybe columns are being compressed. For example, the input columns 1 and7 (which are at the ends) in the input's 9 columns are mapped to the middle columns in the output's5 columns.\n\nIf the input has 9 columns and the output has5, maybe each output column is a combination of two input columns except the middle one. For example:\n\nOutput column0: input columns0-1\n\nOutput column1: input columns2-3\n\nOutput column2: input column4 (middle)\n\nOutput column3: input columns5-6\n\nOutput column4: input columns7-8\n\nThen, for each output column, take the max of the input columns.\n\nFor Example1, input row1: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nSo columns1 and7 are 3s. If mapped to output columns:\n\ncolumn0: max(0,3)=3? But output row0 starts with 0. Hmm, maybe sum instead. Or maybe the output columns are centered differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output columns are the middle columns of the input. For Example1, the input has9 columns. The middle is column4. The output has5 columns, which could be columns2-6. Let's check:\n\nRow1 of input: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nColumns2-6: 0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 but output row0 is [0,3,3,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: the output's columns correspond to the positions of the non-zero elements in the input's rows. For example, in Example0's input rows1 and5, the 4s are in positions1 and5. The output has three columns. Maybe 1 and5 are mapped to 1 and3 in the output, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by taking the non-zero elements from each row and stacking them, but Example0's output has more 4s than the input's 4s. For instance, input has four 4s, output has six 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a result of some kind of mirroring or symmetry. For example, in Example0, the input is symmetric left-right and top-bottom. The output is a smaller symmetric grid. But how to derive the output from that.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the output is the sum of the input's non-zero elements along certain diagonals or directions. For example, adding numbers along each diagonal and placing the sum in the output. But in Example0, the output has 4s and not sums.\n\nHmm. Let's think of each example's output and see if there's a pattern in how they are formed.\n\nExample0's output:\n\nRow0: 0,4,0 \u2192 maybe from the input's top 4s (row1, columns1 and5). If we take those 4s and place them in the middle of the output's first row.\n\nRow1:4,4,4 \u2192 maybe from the middle rows (rows2,3,4) of the input, which have 2s. But why 4s here?\n\nWait, perhaps the output is combining the maximum values from symmetric positions. For instance, in the input, for each pair of symmetric cells, take the max and place them in the output. For example, in a 7x7 grid, the center is (3,3). Cells (i,j) and (6-i,6-j) are symmetric. Taking the max of these pairs would give a grid that's folded. The output would then be the upper-left quadrant. For Example0, the 4s are at (1,1) and (5,5), which are symmetric. The max is 4, so in the output's position (1,1). Similarly, the 2s in the middle would be maxed. But Example0's output has 4s where there are 2s in the input, which contradicts. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a diamond shape where the numbers are placed based on their distance from the center. For example, the 4s in Example0's input are two steps from the center, and the 2s are one step. The output arranges them such that the farther numbers (4s) form the outer ring and the 2s the inner. But the output in Example0 doesn't have 2s. Hmm, that can't be right.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output's numbers are the same as the numbers in the input. So the transformation isn't changing the values, just their positions. The question is, how are their positions transformed.\n\nLooking at the test input. Let's see if we can find a pattern that fits all examples and then apply it.\n\nThe test input is a 19x19 grid. The non-zero numbers are 2,3. Let's find where they are.\n\nRows 2 and 11 have 2s in columns2 and13 (assuming 0-based index). Rows4,5,6,7,8,9,10 have 3s in various positions.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 3s are spread out, forming some kind of shape, perhaps a diamond or cross.\n\nAssuming that the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements and arranging them in a compressed grid where each row and column is collapsed based on symmetry or certain rules.\n\nLooking at the training examples' outputs:\n\n- Example0's output has 3 rows and 3 columns. The input has 7 rows and 7 columns. 7-3=4, which is even, so perhaps each output row combines two input rows, except the middle one.\n\n- Example1's output has 3 rows and5 columns. Input has 12 rows and9 columns. 12 rows \u21923 output rows: 12/3=4. So each output row combines 4 input rows. Similarly, columns 9 \u21925: maybe each output column combines 2 input columns except the middle.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output dimensions are determined by the number of unique non-zero rows and columns in the input. For example, if the input has non-zero elements in rows 1,5 and 2,3,4, then the output rows might be the number of unique non-zero rows divided by 2.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother angle: the output seems to be a kind of \"compressed\" version of the input's non-zero elements, but arranged in a way that their relative positions are preserved but scaled down.\n\nFor example, in Example0, the input's 4s are at the corners, and the output's 4s are in a cross. Maybe the output is a diamond shape, where the 4s from the corners are brought towards the center.\n\nBut how to map the positions.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements and placing them in a grid that's centered and scaled. For instance, if the input is larger, the output is a smaller grid where each cell represents a certain area of the input.\n\nBut the challenge is to find how exactly to map the positions.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the sum of the input's elements along their diagonals. For example, for each possible diagonal in the input, sum the elements and place them in the output. But in Example0, the output has 4s, which would require the sum of multiple 4s and 2s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the maximum value in each \"ring\" around the center. For example, in Example0, the center is (3,3). The rings around it would have 4s in the first ring and 2s in the next. The output might be the maximum of each ring. But Example0's output has multiple 4s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements and shifting them towards the center. For example, elements in the input are moved inward by a certain amount to form the output. So, in Example0, the 4s at (1,1) and (1,5) are moved towards the center to (0,1) and (0,1) in the output? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a rotated and scaled version of the input. For instance, rotating the input by 45 degrees and then cropping. This could explain the cross shape in Example0's output.\n\nIf we rotate the input by 45 degrees, the diamond shape of 4s would become a cross. But how to map this.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking each non-zero element and placing it in a new grid based on its distance from the center. For example, elements at a certain distance from the center are placed in a specific row or column of the output.\n\nFor Example0, the 4s are two cells away from the center (3,3). The 2s are one cell away. So in the output, perhaps each row corresponds to a certain distance. But the output has 3 rows, and the distances are 2 and1. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.\n\nLooking at the test input's structure. The 2s are in rows 2 and11, columns2 and13. The 3s are in various positions, forming a sort of structure. The output should be a grid of 3s and 2s arranged according to the pattern.\n\nBut according to the training examples, the output contains only the highest number present. For example, in Example0, the input has 4s and 2s, and the output only has 4s. In Example1, input has 3s and 2s, output has only 3s. Example2 has 6s and 8s, output has 6s. Example3 has 8s and 4s, output has 8s. So the pattern seems to be that the output only includes the highest number from the input.\n\nAh, this is a crucial observation. In each example, the output contains only the highest number present in the input. Example0's input has 4 and 2; output has 4s. Example1's input has 3 and 2; output has 3s. Example2 has 6 and8; output has6s. Wait, no! Example2's input has 6 and8. Output has6s, but 8 is higher than6. That contradicts the pattern. Wait, what's Example2's input and output?\n\nLooking back:\n\nExample2's input has rows with 6s and 8s. For example:\n\nRow5: ...6...6...\n\nRow6: ...8...\n\nRow7: ...8...\n\nRow8: ...8,8,8...\n\nRow9: ...8,8...\n\nRow10: ...6...6...\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0,6,0,0]\n\n[0,6,0,0]\n\n[6,6,6,0]\n\n[0,6,6,0]\n\nAll are 6s. But the input has 8s, which are higher. So this contradicts the previous pattern. Therefore, the output is not taking the highest number. So that theory is invalid.\n\nHmm. So back to square one.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the output is a kind of \"connected components\" where each component of the same number is compressed into a smaller grid. For example, in Example0, the 4s form a diamond shape, which when compressed becomes a cross.\n\nBut how to map the positions.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the intersection of the non-zero elements' positions. For example, in Example0, the 4s are in rows1 and5, columns1 and5. The 2s are in the center rows and columns. The output's positions could be the intersection of these rows and columns. But how.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the product of rows and columns that have non-zero elements. For example, if rows 1,2,3,4,5 have non-zero elements and columns1,2,3,4,5, then the output is the intersection of those rows and columns. But Example0's output is 3x3, which doesn't match.\n\nAnother observation: the output dimensions for the examples:\n\nExample0: 3x3\n\nExample1:3x5\n\nExample2:4x4\n\nExample3:4x8\n\nTest input's output is likely to have dimensions based on the non-zero elements' positions.\n\nMaybe the number of rows in the output is equal to the number of unique non-zero rows divided by 2, and similarly for columns. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows correspond to the number of distinct non-zero values in the input. For example, in Example0, there are two distinct numbers (4 and2), but output has three rows. So that's not.\n\nAnother approach: look for the output grids in the training examples and see if they appear as part of the input, rotated or transformed.\n\nExample0's output:\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[0,4,4]\n\nDoes this grid appear in the input rotated? Let's see. The input has a row with [0,4,0,0,0,4,0]. If we take the middle three columns, it's [0,0,0], which doesn't match. So no.\n\nExample1's output is 3x5. The input has rows with 3s in positions1 and7 (columns). The output's first row is [0,3,3,0,0]. Maybe this is formed by combining the 3s from different rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking the non-zero elements from each \"quadrant\" of the input. For example, in Example0, the input is divided into four quadrants around the center, and each quadrant's non-zero elements are summed or maxed to form the output.\n\nBut Example0's output has 3x3, which doesn't divide into quadrants neatly.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the result of a downsampling of the input. For example, every other row and column is taken. But Example0's input is 7x7. Taking every other row would give 4 rows (rows0,2,4,6). Output has3 rows. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the central part of the input after removing borders. For example, Example0's input 7x7, remove two borders to get 3x3. But the central 3x3 of input Example0 doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input and arranging them in a grid that's the size of the number of layers or something else.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nExample0's output has 3 rows, each with 3 elements. The sum of 4s is 0+4+0 +4+4+4 +0+4+4 = 20. Input's sum of 4s is 4*4=16 (four 4s in input) and 2s sum to 2+2+2+2+2=10. Output sum is 20, which is higher. So it's not sum.\n\nExample1's output has 3 rows. Sum of 3s:\n\nRow0: 0+3+3+0+0=6\n\nRow1:0+3+3+0+3=9\n\nRow2:3+0+0+3+0=6 \u2192 total 21. Input's 3s: in rows1 and5, columns1 and7 (each row has two 3s, but rows1 and5 have two each? Let's count. Input rows1 and5 are:\n\nRow1: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0] \u2192 two 3s.\n\nRow5: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0] \u2192 two 3s. So total 8 3s. Output has 6+9+6=21 3s, which is much higher. So that's impossible. So sum is not the case.\n\nTherefore, the output isn't a sum. It must be a structural transformation.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the transpose of the non-zero elements arranged in a certain way. For example, in Example0, the 4s are in certain columns and rows, and the output is their transpose. But the output's rows and columns don't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the mirror image of the non-zero elements. For Example0's input, the 4s are symmetric, and the output is also symmetric. But how.\n\nAnother possible pattern: each output row corresponds to a diagonal in the input. For example, in Example0's output, the middle row has 4s which could be from the main diagonal of the input. But input's main diagonal has 0,4,0,2,0,4,0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a spiral of the non-zero elements. For example, starting from the top-left 4 in the input and spiraling inward to collect values. But the output's arrangement doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the input's non-zero elements where each row in the output is a diagonal in the input. For example, the first output row is the main diagonal, the second is the diagonal below, etc. But Example0's input's main diagonal is 0,4,0,2,0,4,0. The output's first row is [0,4,0], which matches the first three elements (0,4,0). The second row of the output is [4,4,4], which could be the next diagonal. But this is speculative.\n\nIn Example0's input, the main diagonal is 0,4,0,2,0,4,0. If we take the first three elements (0,4,0), that's the output's first row. Then, the next diagonal (elements 1,4,0) would be 4,0,0. Not matching. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0, the output has the same number of 4s as the input. Input has four 4s. Output has 0,4,0; 4,4,4; 0,4,4 \u2192 total 0+4+0=4, 4+4+4=12, 0+4+4=8 \u2192 total 24. Wait, that's not matching. So no.\n\nHmm. Let's try to look at the positions of the non-zero elements in the input and output.\n\nIn Example0's input, the 4s are at (1,1), (1,5), (5,1), (5,5). The output's 4s are at positions (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nSo, the input's 4s are at the four corners of a square around the center. The output's 4s form a cross plus an extra 4 at (2,2).\n\nCould the output be a transformed view of these positions? For example, if we consider the input's 4s as forming a square, the output's cross is a projection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking each pair of symmetric 4s and placing them in specific positions. For example, (1,1) and (5,5) are symmetric across the center. Maybe their positions are averaged or mapped to a central position.\n\nFor instance, (1,1) in a 7x7 grid would be at a distance of 2 from the center (3,3). When mapped to a 3x3 grid, maybe (1,1) becomes (0,0), but the output's (0,0) is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output's coordinates are the input's coordinates divided by 2 and floored. For example, in Example0's input of 7x7:\n\nOutput is 3x3. For each cell in the output, the x and y are input x//2 and y//2.\n\nFor input cell (1,1): output (0,0). But output (0,0) is 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the output's coordinates are input coordinates minus some offset. For example, for the 4 at (1,1) in input, output is (0,1). But why?\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows are the input's rows divided by 2. For example, output row0 corresponds to input row0 and row1. But not sure.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nAnother observation: in each example, the output's number of rows is roughly half the number of non-zero rows in the input. For Example0, input non-zero rows are 5 (rows1-5), output is3 rows. 5/2 ~ 2.5 \u2192 3. Example1's input non-zero rows are rows1,5, and others with 2s. But output is3 rows. Maybe it's the number of layers or something.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the non-zero rows from the input, but with every other row taken. For example, in Example0, rows1,3,5. But output has3 rows. Row1:4s, row3:2s, row5:4s. But output has 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the central non-zero rows and columns. For example, in Example0, the central rows are 2,3,4 (which have 2s). But output has 4s.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think of the test input and see if applying any possible pattern might work.\n\nTest input has 2s in rows2 and11, columns2 and13. 3s are in various positions. The highest number is3, so the output should have3s.\n\nThe output will likely be a grid where the 3s are arranged in a pattern derived from the input's 3 positions.\n\nLooking at the input's 3s:\n\nRow4: columns4,9,10.\n\nRow5: column4.\n\nRow6: column6.\n\nRow7: columns6,7,8.\n\nRow8: columns8,11.\n\nRow9: column11.\n\nRow10: columns7,8.\n\nRow11: columns2,13 (but those are 2s).\n\nSo the 3s form a sort of diamond or cross. Maybe the output is a compressed version of this.\n\nAssuming the output is formed by combining certain rows and columns. For example, each output row is a combination of two input rows, and each output column is a combination of two input columns.\n\nIf the input is 19x19, perhaps the output rows are formed by combining rows2-11 (since non-zero rows are 2,4-11,11) into fewer rows. Similarly for columns.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and lack of progress, perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output is the result of collapsing each pair of symmetric rows into a single row. For example, in Example0, the input has rows1 and5 as mirrors. Combining them into a single row in the output. Similarly, rows2 and4, and the middle row3.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nCombining rows1 and5:\n\nRow1: [0,4,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nRow5: [0,4,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nCombined by taking the max or sum. If max, we get the same row. But output row0 is [0,4,0]. Maybe taking the first half. Row1 has 7 elements. First half is elements0-3: [0,4,0,0]. But output row0 is3 elements. Maybe centered.\n\nAlternatively, taking the middle three elements of the combined rows. For rows1 and5:\n\nMiddle three elements of row1 (columns2-4): 0,0,0 \u2192 output row0's middle is4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows are formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input's rows and placing them in the output's rows. For example, input row1 has 4s at columns1 and5. Output row0 has a 4 in the middle. Maybe the columns are compressed such that columns1 and5 are merged into column1 of the output.\n\nBut how to determine the mapping.\n\nAlternatively, the columns in the output are the columns in the input that contain non-zero elements. For example, in Example0, the non-zero columns are1,3,5. The output has3 columns, which could correspond to these. But Example0's output columns have 4s in positions0,1,2. So maybe columns1,3,5 are mapped to output columns0,1,2.\n\nIn Example0's input row1, columns1 and5 are4. In the output row0, columns0 and2 are0, and column1 is4. So perhaps columns1 and5 are averaged into column1 of the output.\n\nSo for each input row that has non-zero elements, we take the non-zero columns and combine them into the output's columns.\n\nFor Example0's row1: columns1 and5 are4. Output row0 is [0,4,0]. So columns1 and5 are mapped to column1 in the output. Similarly, other rows are processed.\n\nFor the input's row3, which has 2s in columns2-4. Output row1 has [4,4,4]. But 4s are from input's 4s. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nThis is getting too frustrating. Maybe the pattern is that each output cell is the maximum value of the corresponding cells in the input's four quadrants. For example, for a 7x7 input:\n\nQuadrants are top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right. Each output cell is the max of the corresponding quadrant.\n\nFor Example0's input:\n\nTop-left quadrant (rows0-3, columns0-3) includes the 4 at (1,1) and 2s in row3. So the max is4. But output row0 has0,4,0. So maybe each quadrant is split further.\n\nAlternatively, each output cell corresponds to a 2x2 block in the input. For Example0's input, each 2x2 block is:\n\nBut 7x7 can't be divided into 2x2 blocks evenly. This approach doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the result of applying a convolution with a certain kernel. For example, a kernel that detects the presence of certain numbers in the neighboring cells. But without knowing the kernel, this is hard.\n\nAfter trying various approaches and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input's 3s:\n\nRow4: columns4,9,10.\n\nRow5: column4.\n\nRow6: column6.\n\nRow7: columns6,7,8.\n\nRow8: columns8,11.\n\nRow9: column11.\n\nRow10: columns7,8.\n\nAssuming the output is formed by collapsing these rows and columns into a smaller grid where each row corresponds to a group of input rows and each column to a group of input columns.\n\nFor example, rows4-10 are the non-zero rows. Perhaps grouped into 4 output rows. Columns4,6,7,8,9,10,11 are non-zero. Grouped into 5 columns.\n\nBut how to map them.\n\nAlternatively, the output is arranged such that each row represents a vertical line in the input and each column represents a horizontal line.\n\nBut this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a diamond shape where the 3s are arranged similarly to the input's positions. For example, the test input's 3s form a sort of diamond. The output could be a compressed diamond.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the output seems to be a compressed version where certain rows and columns are merged. For instance, in Example0, the output is formed by taking the middle rows and columns where the non-zero elements are concentrated. For the test input, the non-zero elements are in rows4-10 and columns4-11. The output would likely be a grid that captures these regions.\n\nAssuming that each output row corresponds to two input rows, and each output column corresponds to two input columns. For example, the test input has 19 rows and 19 columns. The non-zero rows are from 4 to 10 (7 rows). Grouping them into 4 output rows (7/2 ~3.5 \u21924). Similarly, columns4-11 (8 columns) grouped into 4 output columns (8/2=4). So output would be 4x4. But looking at the training examples:\n\nExample3's input has 18x18, output is4x8. So columns might be grouped differently.\n\nAlternatively, the number of output rows and columns is determined by the number of unique non-zero elements in rows and columns. For the test input, the non-zero rows are 4,5,6,7,8,9,10 (7 rows). Perhaps grouped into 4 output rows. Columns4,6,7,8,9,10,11 (7 columns) grouped into 4 output columns.\n\nBut this is guesswork. \n\nLooking at the test input's 3s:\n\nRow4: columns4,9,10.\n\nRow5:4.\n\nRow6:6.\n\nRow7:6,7,8.\n\nRow8:8,11.\n\nRow9:11.\n\nRow10:7,8.\n\nAssuming the output is formed by combining columns4-6 into one column,7-8 into another,9-10 into another, and11 into another. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, columns4,6,7,8,9,10,11 are mapped to output columns0-3. For example:\n\ncolumns4 \u21920,\n\ncolumns6 \u21921,\n\ncolumns7-8 \u21922,\n\ncolumns9-10 \u21923,\n\ncolumn11 \u21924.\n\nBut this is arbitrary.\n\nGiven that the training examples often have outputs where the same number forms a connected shape, perhaps the test output is:\n\n[0,0,3,0,0]\n\n[0,3,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,3,0]\n\nBut this is a guess. Alternatively, given the complexity, the output might look like:\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the cross pattern.\n\nHowever, since I can't find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. In Example3, the output has 4 rows and8 columns. The test input's output might have 4 rows and5 columns. But this is a shot in the dark.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed to provide an answer based on the following pattern I'm hypothesizing: the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input, rotating them 45 degrees clockwise, and then cropping to form a diamond shape. For example, the 3s in the test input form a diamond, which when rotated becomes a square. The output would then be a grid capturing this rotated structure.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the output could be:\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n\n[3,3,3,0]\n\n[0,3,3,3]\n\n[0,0,3,0]\n\nBut this is speculative. Alternatively, based on Example0's pattern where the output is a cross, the test output might be:\n\n[0,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\n[0,3,3]\n\nBut given the test input's larger structure, the output might be larger.\n\nAlternatively, considering the test input's 3s form a kind of 'H' shape, the output might be a compressed version of that.\n\nAfter struggling, I'll have to settle for an answer that reflects the most likely pattern based on the examples.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by analyzing the examples one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input. The input is a 7x7 grid. The output is a 3x3 grid. The numbers in the output seem to be related to the numbers in the input. Let me check the positions. The output's first row is [0,4,0], which might correspond to the 4s in the input's second row. The middle row of the output is [4,4,4], maybe combining the 4s from different rows. Wait, the input has 4s in positions (1,1) and (1,5) (assuming 0-based indexing). The output's middle row is all 4s. Hmm. Maybe there's a symmetry here. The input's 4s are symmetric around the center, and the output captures that in a smaller grid.\n\nExample 1's input is a 12x9 grid (wait, the input has 12 rows?) Wait, let me count. The input for Example 1 has 12 rows, each with 9 elements. The output is a 3x5 grid. So, the output is smaller. The numbers here are 3 and 2. The output rows have 3s. Let's see where the 3s are in the input. In the input, the 3s are in rows 1 and 5, positions 1 and 7. The output has a row [0,3,3,0,3]\u2014maybe combining elements from different rows. The third row of the output is [3,0,0,3,0], which might be taking elements from the 3s in the input, possibly mirrored.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input. The output is a 4x4 grid. The input has 6s and 8s. The output has 6s in certain positions. The 6s in the input are in row 5 and row 10, columns 3 and 8. The output rows are [0,6,0,0], [0,6,0,0], [6,6,6,0], [0,6,6,0]. Maybe it's capturing clusters of 6s and 8s? Wait, but the 8s are present in the input, but the output only has 6s. So maybe the output is focusing on a specific number, perhaps the one that appears symmetrically.\n\nExample 3's input is a 12x18 grid (rows x columns?), but the output is a 4x8 grid. The numbers here are 8 and 4. The output has 8s in various positions. The input's 8s are in rows 1,6, and perhaps others. The output seems to collect certain positions where 8s are in the input, maybe their positions mirrored or rotated.\n\nSo, trying to find a common pattern. The output grids are smaller than the input. The numbers in the output are the same as in the input. It looks like the output is capturing some kind of central or symmetric elements. Maybe the pattern involves taking the non-zero elements that are in symmetric positions relative to the center of the input grid and condensing them into a smaller grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by combining layers or certain rows and columns. For instance, in Example 0, the input has 4s on both sides of the middle row. The output's middle row has all 4s. Maybe the output is taking the middle layer and surrounding elements.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the output dimensions. For Example 0, input is 7x7 (odd), output is 3x3 (the center part). Example 1 input has 12 rows and 9 columns. Output is 3 rows and 5 columns. Not sure about that. Maybe the number of non-zero rows in the input affects the output's row count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking all the non-zero elements and arranging them in a compact form. But in Example 0, the input has 4s and 2s, but the output is all 4s. So maybe only certain numbers are considered. Wait, in Example 0, the output is all 4s except for the 4s in the input. The 2s in the input are not in the output. So perhaps the pattern focuses on the largest number present. Wait, in Example 0, the input has 4 and 2. The output is all 4s. In Example 1, the input has 3, 2. Output is all 3s. Example 2: input has 6, 8. Output is 6s. Example 3: input has 8 and 4. Output is 8s. So the output seems to use the largest number in the input as the focus. So the pattern might be: for each input grid, find the largest number, then create an output grid that captures the positions of those numbers in a condensed way.\n\nBut how are the positions condensed? Let's see. For Example 0, the input has 4s in positions (1,1), (1,5), (5,1), (5,5). The output is 3x3. If you arrange these 4s, perhaps the output is combining these positions into a diamond shape. Wait, the output is:\n\n[0,4,0]\n[4,4,4]\n[0,4,4]\n\nHmm, that's not a diamond. Maybe the output is constructed by taking the middle rows and columns where the numbers are present. Or perhaps the output is a kind of \"compression\" where each element in the output is the maximum of certain regions in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from certain layers of the input. For example, in Example 0, the 4s are in the second and sixth rows (if rows are 0-indexed), but in the output, they are arranged in three rows. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at how the input's non-zero numbers (of the largest value) are arranged. For example, in Example 0, the 4s are in a cross shape, perhaps. Then the output arranges them into a smaller cross. But the output is 3x3. The input's 4s are at (1,1), (1,5), (5,1), (5,5). If the center of the input is row 3, column 3 (0-based?), then those positions are symmetric. The output's middle row has 4s, possibly combining those positions. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by \"folding\" the input grid along its vertical and horizontal centers, adding up the numbers where they overlap, but only keeping the largest number. For instance, in Example 0, folding the input would stack the 4s from the top and bottom onto the middle rows, resulting in 4s in the middle rows. But the output's middle row is [4,4,4], which might correspond to the sum of the top and bottom 4s. But why the 0s become 4s? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output might represent the count or presence of the largest number in certain regions. Like, if you divide the input into quadrants or sections and check where the largest number is present.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The largest number is 3. The 3s are in rows 1 and 5, columns 1 and 7. The output is a 3x5 grid. The output has 3s arranged in a way that might correspond to their positions in the input. For instance, the first row of the output is [0,3,3,0,0], which could be capturing the left and right 3s from the input's row 1 and 5. Maybe the output is taking the central area of the input and combining mirrored positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is created by taking the central rows and columns of the input where the largest numbers are present. For Example 0, the input is 7x7. The central row is 3 (0-based index). The output is 3x3, which would be rows 2-4 and columns 2-4 of the input. But in the input's row 3, column 2-4 are [0,0,2,0,0], which doesn't match the output. So maybe not.\n\nAnother idea: The output dimensions might be determined by the positions of the largest numbers. For instance, in Example 0, the 4s are in rows 1 and 5 (distance of 2 from the center row 3). The output has 3 rows, perhaps covering from row 1 to row 5. But in 7 rows, rows 1-5 would be 5 rows, but the output has 3. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking every other row and column where the largest numbers appear. For example, in Example 0, the 4s are in rows 1 and 5. If we take the middle row (3), and the rows above and below (1 and 5), but then condense them. But the output is three rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a combination of the non-zero elements of the largest number, rotated or mirrored. Let's see Example 0's output: the first row is [0,4,0], which is the same as the 4s in row 1 of the input (columns 1 and 5) but compressed. Maybe they are overlapping when folded.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as having a diamond or cross shape. The output might be a compressed version where each layer of the input's cross is merged.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking the positions of the largest numbers and then creating a grid that represents the minimal bounding box around those positions, scaled down. But in Example 0, the 4s are at the corners of a square. The minimal bounding box would be a 5x5 area, but the output is 3x3. So scaling down.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a transformation where the input grid is split into quadrants, and the largest numbers in each quadrant are combined. But Example 0's 4s are in two quadrants (top-left and top-right? No, positions (1,1) and (1,5) in a 7x7 grid would be in the top-left and top-right quadrants. But the output has 4s in all three rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by rotating or reflecting parts of the input. For example, in Example 0, the input has 4s symmetrically placed. If you take the left half and mirror it over the right half, adding values where they overlap, but only for the largest number. But the output's middle row is [4,4,4], which could be the sum of left and right 4s. But how does that work for other examples?\n\nIn Example 2, the output has rows with 6s. The input's 6s are in rows 5 and 10, columns 3 and 8. The output's third row is [6,6,6,0], which could be combining those positions. Maybe the output is constructed by collapsing the input's rows and columns where the largest numbers are present.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the sum of the upper and lower halves of the input for the largest number. For Example 0, the 4s are in rows 1 and 5. If you add them to the central row, you get 4s in the middle rows. But how that translates to the output.\n\nWait, let's think about the output for each example. The output grids have rows that seem to be combinations of certain rows from the input. For example, in Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [0,4,0] \u2013 perhaps the 4s from row 1 and row 5 (since input row 1 and 5 have 4s in columns 1 and 5).\n\nRow 1: [4,4,4] \u2013 maybe combining the 4s from row 1 and row 5's middle column (but the input's middle column is 0). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are created by taking the maximum value from certain rows in the input. For Example 0's output row 0: it's the max of input rows 0,1, and 2? Or maybe combining rows that are mirrored around the center.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements of the largest number and arranging them in a diamond shape. For Example 0's 4s: positions (1,1), (1,5), (5,1), (5,5) form a square. The output's rows are three, with the middle row having three 4s. Maybe this is a diamond shape.\n\nBut how do the other examples fit? In Example 3, the output has 8s in positions that might form a pattern when mirrored.\n\nAnother observation: The number of rows in the output seems to be related to the distance of the non-zero elements from the center. For instance, in Example 0, the 4s are two rows away from the center (rows 1 and 5 in a 7-row grid, center row is 3). The output has three rows. Maybe the number of layers or the depth of the largest numbers determines the output size.\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows correspond to the layers of the input where the largest numbers appear. Each layer is a concentric ring around the center. The output's rows might be collapsing these layers into a smaller grid.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a projection of the input's largest numbers along certain axes. For example, in Example 0, the 4s are in the corners of a square. Projecting them along the diagonals might form the output's pattern.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think differently. Let's look at the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nIt's a 19x19 grid (19 rows, each with 19 elements). The numbers present are 2, 3, and possibly others. The largest number is 3. So according to previous examples, the output should be composed of 3s.\n\nLooking at the input, the 3s are in rows 4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Let me check:\n\nRow 4: columns 4, 9, 10 have 3s.\nRow 5: column 4 has 3.\nRow 6: column 6 has 3.\nRow 7: columns 6,7,8 have 3s.\nRow 8: column 8 and 11 have 3s.\nRow 9: column 11 has 3.\nRow 10: columns 7,8 have 3s.\n\nAlso, there are 2s in rows 2 and 11, column 2 and 13. But since 3 is the largest number, the output will focus on 3s.\n\nThe output needs to be a grid of 3s arranged in a pattern derived from their positions in the input.\n\nLooking at how the previous examples handled similar situations. For instance, Example 1 had 3s in rows 1 and 5, columns 1 and 7. The output was a 3x5 grid. The output's first row had 3s in columns 1 and 2 (0-based?), perhaps combining the left and right positions from the input.\n\nSo maybe the test input's 3s are arranged in a way that, when mirrored or compressed, form certain rows.\n\nLooking at the 3s in the test input:\n\nRow 4 has 3s at columns 4,9,10. Row 5 has 3 at column4. Row6: column6. Row7: 6,7,8. Row8: 8 and11. Row9:11. Row10:7,8.\n\nThese positions might form a diamond or some symmetric shape when mirrored. For example, row4's 3s are on the left and middle-right, while row7's are in the middle. Perhaps when folded vertically, these positions overlap.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by taking the central part of the input where the 3s are clustered.\n\nAlternatively, the output is built by combining the 3s from different rows, centering them in a new grid.\n\nBut this is vague. Let's try to see if there's a pattern in how the input rows are transformed into output rows.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput rows 1 and 5 have 4s. The output's rows are:\n\n[0,4,0] \u2013 possibly from row1's 4s, but only taking the middle part.\n\n[4,4,4] \u2013 middle row, which might combine row1 and row5's 4s.\n\n[0,4,4] \u2013 maybe from row5's 4s. But why two 4s here?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the sum of rows mirrored around the center. For example, row1 and row5 are symmetrical. So summing them would give the middle row of the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the max of the input's mirrored rows. For Example 0, row1 and row5 are mirrored. Taking the max of each corresponding element would give a row with 4s at positions 1 and 5, but since the output is 3 columns, maybe they are centered.\n\nBut the input has 7 columns. The center is column3 (0-based). The 4s are at columns1 and5, which are two positions left and right of center. If we take a window around the center, columns 2,3,4 would be the middle three. But the 4s are at columns1 and5, which are outside that window. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is created by collapsing the input into a smaller grid by combining elements from mirrored positions. For instance, each cell in the output corresponds to a pair of cells in the input that are symmetric around the center. If either of the pair has the largest number, the output cell gets that number.\n\nFor Example 0, the 4s are in pairs (1,1) and (5,5), (1,5) and (5,1). Each pair is symmetric. So each pair contributes to a single cell in the output. For example, (1,1) and (5,5) would correspond to the same output cell. So the output would have 4s at positions that combine these mirrored pairs.\n\nBut how does that lead to the output structure? For a 7x7 input, the center is at (3,3). The mirrored pairs would be (i,j) and (6-i,6-j). So for (1,1) and (5,5), they are mirrored around the center. If we collapse them into one cell in the output, the output would have cells corresponding to the upper-left quadrant plus the center.\n\nBut the output size varies. For example, Example 0's output is 3x3, which is the center plus one layer around. So each output cell represents four input cells (mirrored). So for example, the output cell (0,0) corresponds to input cells (0,0), (0,6), (6,0), (6,6). But since these are all zeros, the output is 0. But the output cell (0,1) would correspond to input cells (0,1), (0,5), (6,1), (6,5). In the input, row1 has a 4 at (1,1) and (1,5), which are mirrored. So in the output, these would collapse into (0,1) and (0,1) in the output? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each output cell is the maximum of the four mirrored input cells. For Example 0, the output cell (0,1) would take the max of (1,1), (1,5), (5,1), (5,5), which are all 4s, so output is 4. But in the output, the first row is [0,4,0]. So that doesn't align. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a quarter of the input, assuming symmetry. But Example 0's output has three rows, which is not a quarter of seven.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nAnother observation: In each example, the output's row count is the same as the number of layers or distinct rows in the input where the largest number appears. For Example 0, the 4s appear in rows 1 and 5. The output has 3 rows. Maybe 1, center, and 5. But how.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the rows that contain the largest number and collapsing them into a single row by taking the maximum value in each column. But in Example 0, the rows with 4s are 1 and 5. If we take max between these rows, but since they are mirrored, perhaps the output rows are a combination.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by taking the middle row of the input and the rows above and below that contain the largest numbers, then compressing them into a smaller grid.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a \"compressed\" view where each cell is the sum of the largest number in a certain area. For instance, in Example 0, the 4s are in the four corners of a square. The output could be a 3x3 grid where each cell represents a quadrant of the input. But not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about Example 3's input. The input has 8s in rows 1 and 6 (assuming 0-based). The output has four rows. For example, the output row 0 is [0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0]. How does that relate to the input's 8s? The input's 8s are in row 1, columns 2 and 11, and row 6, columns 2 and 11. The output's first row has 8s in positions 3 and 4 (assuming 0-based). Maybe the output rows are built by taking the positions of the 8s and adjusting their column indices relative to the center.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by rotating the input's non-zero elements. For instance, Example 0's 4s form a cross, and the output is a rotated version. But I don't see a clear rotation.\n\nAnother idea: The output grids seem to be formed by taking the positions of the largest number and creating a new grid where each row corresponds to a diagonal or line in the input. For example, in Example 0, the 4s are at (1,1), (1,5), (5,1), (5,5). The output's rows could be diagonals connecting these points, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the largest number's positions projected onto a smaller grid by some formula. For example, taking the positions (i,j) of the largest number in the input and mapping them to (i', j') in the output where i' = i - offset, j' = j - offset. But how to determine the offset.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in the output dimensions. For Example 0: input 7x7, output 3x3. Example 1: input 12x9, output 3x5. Example 2: input 12x14, output 4x4. Example 3: input 12x18, output 4x8. The test input is 19x19. So the output dimensions vary and don't directly relate to the input dimensions in an obvious way.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output: 3x3. The number of non-zero rows in the input for the largest number (4s) is 2 rows (rows 1 and 5). The output has 3 rows, which is 2+1 (the center row). Maybe the output row count is the number of distinct rows with the largest number plus one. But Example 1's input has 3s in rows 1 and 5 (two rows), output has 3 rows. That fits. Example 2's input has 6s in rows 5 and 10 (two rows), output has 4 rows. Hmm, that breaks the pattern. Example 3's input has 8s in rows 1 and 6 (two rows), output has 4 rows. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: For each example, look at how the largest number is positioned and how they appear in the output.\n\nExample 0: Input 4s are in a diamond pattern. Output's 4s are in a sort of triangle shape. The output's rows are [0,4,0], [4,4,4], [0,4,4]. So the bottom row has two 4s. Maybe this is the lower half of the diamond.\n\nExample 1: Output has 3s arranged in a pattern that might form a cross or other shape.\n\nExample 2: Output's 6s are in a sort of pyramid.\n\nExample 3: Output's 8s are spread out in different positions.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that the output is the largest number's positions compressed by removing empty rows and columns, then rotated or mirrored. But in Example 0, if you take the positions of the 4s and remove empty rows and columns, you would get a 2x2 grid, but the output is 3x3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output's rows have the largest number appearing in consecutive or nearly consecutive positions, forming a kind of shape. Maybe the output is a representation of the \"core\" shape of the largest number's distribution in the input, scaled down.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as a 2D array, and the output is a kind of \"eroded\" version, removing layers of zeros around the largest numbers.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by starting from the center of the input and expanding outward, collecting the largest numbers encountered, until no more are found. For Example 0, starting at (3,3), which is 0. So move outward. The first non-zero would be the 2s, but since the largest is 4, maybe it's looking for 4s. The 4s are at a distance of 2 from the center. So the output would be those positions arranged around the center.\n\nBut this is speculative. Maybe I need to find a mathematical relation between input and output positions.\n\nAlternatively, the output dimensions are determined by the maximum distance of the largest number's positions from the center. For Example 0, the 4s are 2 rows away from the center (rows 1 and 5 in a 7-row grid). The output has 3 rows, which is 2*1 +1. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the largest number's positions and applying a transformation: (i,j) in input maps to (floor(i/2), floor(j/2)) in output. For Example 0, the 7x7 grid would be divided into 3x3 cells (since 7/2=3.5, floor is 3). For row 1, columns 1 and 5: floor(1/2)=0, floor(5/2)=2. So output cell (0,2) would get a 4. But the output's first row is [0,4,0], which doesn't fit. Maybe another scaling factor.\n\nAlternatively, each output cell represents a 2x2 block in the input. For Example 0, 7x7 would have 3x3 blocks (last block may be partial). The 4s are in blocks that include (1,1) and (1,5). But this also doesn't fit the output.\n\nAt this point, I might need to consider that the output is formed by a specific pattern that combines certain rows and columns of the input. For example, in Example 0, the output rows could be formed by combining input rows 1,3,5. Let's check:\n\nInput row1: [0,4,0,0,0,4,0]. Middle three elements (columns 2-4): [0,0,0]. That doesn't match the output's first row [0,4,0].\n\nWait, maybe taking columns 1,3,5 from certain rows. For input row1, columns 1,3,5 are 4,0,4. If we take those, the output's first row would be [4,0,4]. But the example's output first row is [0,4,0]. So that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, taking the middle three columns of certain rows. For input row1, columns 2-4 are [0,0,0], which doesn't explain the 4s in the output.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is a transpose of certain rows and columns. Or a diagonal reflection. But not sure.\n\nLet me look at Example 2's input and output. The input has 6s in rows 5 and 10, columns 3 and 8. The output is:\n\n[0,6,0,0]\n[0,6,0,0]\n[6,6,6,0]\n[0,6,6,0]\n\nSo the third row has three 6s. Maybe this is the middle row of the input's 6s. But the input's rows 5 and 10 are separated by other rows. How does this translate?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by the vertical stacking of the 6s. For example, rows 5 and 10 in the input have 6s in columns 3 and 8. In the output, these might be combined into rows that have 6s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, the output's third row is formed by combining rows 5,6,7, etc. But this is unclear.\n\nMaybe the pattern is to take all occurrences of the largest number and arrange them in a new grid where each row corresponds to a diagonal in the input. For example, if the 6s form a diagonal in the input, the output's rows are those diagonals.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's try to think of the test input and see what the output should look like.\n\nTest input's largest number is 3. The 3s are in rows 4,5,6,7,8,9,10. The positions are:\n\nRow4: 4,9,10.\nRow5:4.\nRow6:6.\nRow7:6,7,8.\nRow8:8,11.\nRow9:11.\nRow10:7,8.\n\nThese positions form a sort of diagonal pattern. Maybe the output will arrange these 3s in a way that forms a diamond or a vertical line.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, which was a 3x3 grid, perhaps the test input's output would be a grid where each row corresponds to certain rows of the input, condensed.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are built by taking the leftmost and rightmost occurrences of 3 in each row and placing them in the output.\n\nFor example, in row4: leftmost 3 at column4, rightmost at column10. The output's first row might have 3s in positions corresponding to these. But how to determine the columns.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by taking the columns where the 3s appear and arranging them vertically.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the training examples again:\n\nIn Example 0's output, each row has 4s that are in positions that are mirror images. For instance, the middle row is all 4s. The first row has a single 4 in the middle. The third row has two 4s. This suggests a symmetric pattern.\n\nExample 1's output has 3s arranged in a way that may be symmetric. For instance, the first row has two 3s, the second row has two 3s and one at the end, the third row has two 3s.\n\nExample 2's output has a pyramid-like shape.\n\nExample 3's output has 8s spread out in different positions.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that the output is a compact representation of the largest number's positions, with each row in the output corresponding to a certain 'layer' or distance from the center in the input.\n\nIn the test input, the 3s are spread across multiple rows and columns. Let's see their positions:\n\nRow4: columns4,9,10\nRow5:4\nRow6:6\nRow7:6,7,8\nRow8:8,11\nRow9:11\nRow10:7,8\n\nIf I mirror these positions around the center column (which is column9 in a 19-column grid, 0-based?), some of these might overlap. For example, column4 and 14 (since 19-1-4=14) would be mirrored. But in the input, the 3s are only in columns4,6,7,8,9,10,11. So mirrored positions may not have 3s.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking the leftmost and rightmost occurrences of the largest number in each row and combining them into the output rows. For example, in row4, the leftmost 3 is at column4 and the rightmost at 10. These would be placed in the output's first row at positions corresponding to their distance from the center.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Without a clear pattern, this is challenging.\n\nPerhaps I should try to think of the output as the largest number's positions after applying a specific transformation, such as rotation or reflection. For example, rotating the positions by 45 degrees or another angle. But how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the result of a convolution or another image processing technique that detects edges or features of the largest number's distribution.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a pattern in the number of rows and columns in the output relative to the input.\n\nExample 0: input rows 7, output rows 3 \u2192 7-4=3.\nExample 1: input rows 12, output rows 3 \u2192 12-9=3.\nExample 2: input rows 12, output rows4 \u2192 12-8=4.\nExample 3: input rows12, output rows4 \u2192 12-8=4.\nTest input rows19, maybe output rows (19-?) \n\nBut this doesn't fit a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output's row count is the ceiling of the input row count divided by a certain number. For example, 7/2=3.5 \u2192 3 rows. 12/3=4 \u2192 but Example1 has 3 rows. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the output row count is the number of non-zero rows for the largest number plus one. Example0 has 2 non-zero rows (rows1 and5), output3 rows. Example1: 2 non-zero rows (rows1 and5), output3 rows. Example2: rows5 and10 \u2192 output4 rows. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe it's the number of distinct rows containing the largest number. Example2 has rows5 and10, so output rows could be 2, but output is4. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn the test input, the 3s form a diagonal from row4 to row10, with varying columns. The output likely condenses these into a few rows, possibly creating a diamond or stepped pattern. \n\nLooking at Example3's output, which had 4 rows, perhaps the test input's output will have 4 or 5 rows. But I need to look for the pattern in the existing examples.\n\nExample0's output was 3x3. The input's 4s were in a cross pattern. The output's middle row is all 4s, possibly combining the vertical and horizontal parts of the cross.\n\nExample1's output has 3 rows. The input's 3s were in the first and fifth rows. The output's middle row may combine those.\n\nFor the test input, the 3s are in a diagonal pattern. Maybe the output will have rows that capture the diagonal. For instance:\n\nRow4: columns4,9,10 \u2192 perhaps condensed into a row with 3s in certain positions.\nRow7: columns6,7,8 \u2192 might become a row with three 3s.\nRow10: columns7,8 \u2192 maybe two 3s.\n\nPutting this together, the output might look like:\n\n[0, 3, 0, 0]\n[3, 3, 3, 0]\n[0, 3, 3, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut I need to check the structure of the examples. Example3's output had rows with varying lengths. For example, the first row of Example3's output is [0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0], which is 8 elements. The test input's output might have rows with varying lengths, but according to the examples, all output rows should have the same number of elements.\n\nAlternatively, the output is built by aligning the 3s in a way that forms a shape. For example, the test input's 3s might form a kind of arrow or stepped pattern.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output is the largest number's positions mirrored around the vertical center line. For example, in the test input, the vertical center is at column9 (0-based index). The 3s in column4 would mirror to column14 (19-1-4=14), but there's no 3 there. So this might not apply.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking the leftmost and rightmost 3s in each row and placing them in the output's columns. For example, row4 has leftmost 3 at column4 and rightmost at column10. The difference from the center column (9) is 5 and 1. Maybe these are mapped to certain positions in the output.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to proceed. Given that the test input's 3s are spread out, maybe the output will have a few rows with 3s in positions that form a vertical line or a diagonal.\n\nConsidering the examples and the test input, here's a tentative approach:\n\n1. Identify the largest number in the input (3 in the test case).\n\n2. For each row in the input, collect the positions of the largest number.\n\n3. In the output, create rows that represent these positions in a condensed manner, possibly combining symmetric positions or collapsing them into a central grid.\n\n4. The output rows are likely to have the largest number arranged in a way that's a compact representation of their distribution in the input.\n\nBased on the training examples, the output often has the largest number in the middle rows and columns, forming a compact shape.\n\nIn the test input, the 3s are in rows 4-10, with varying columns. The output might condense these into rows where the 3s are arranged to form a diamond or a vertical line.\n\nGiven the complexity, I'll make an educated guess. The output for the test input might look like:\n\n[0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nBut this is a diamond shape. However, the training examples' outputs don't have symmetric diamonds. For example, Example0's output isn't a perfect diamond.\n\nAlternatively, considering the test input's 3s are in rows4-10, maybe the output will have rows corresponding to the middle part of the input's 3s. For instance, rows6-8, which have 3s in columns6-8 and 11. But the output might need to be smaller.\n\nAnother approach: The output rows correspond to the central rows where the 3s are clustered. For example, rows7-8 in the input have 3s in columns6-8 and 11. The output might capture this as:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 0]\n[3, 0, 0, 3]\n[0, 3, 3, 0]\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be:\n\n[0, 0, 3, 3]\n[0, 3, 3, 0]\n[3, 3, 3, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nBut without a clear pattern, this is hard. Given the time, I'll go with the following output based on the training examples' patterns:\n\nThe output should be a compact version of the 3s in the input. Looking at the rows where 3s are present:\n\nRow4: 4,9,10\nRow5:4\nRow6:6\nRow7:6,7,8\nRow8:8,11\nRow9:11\nRow10:7,8\n\nThese positions could be condensed into a grid where the 3s form a vertical line in the middle rows. So the output might look like:\n\n[0, 3, 0, 0]\n[3, 3, 3, 0]\n[0, 3, 3, 0]\n\nBut considering the examples, the output rows can vary in length. For Example1's output has 5 columns, which is longer than others. So perhaps the test input's output will have more columns.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are constructed by taking the leftmost and rightmost occurrence of 3s and filling between them. For example, in row7, the 3s are from 6 to8. So the output row would have 3s in positions corresponding to 6-8. But how to map that to columns.\n\nThis is too vague. I think I need to make a best-guess output based on the training examples. Looking at Example0's output, which combined the 4s into a central block. The test input's 3s are spread out but perhaps form a central vertical line when condensed.\n\nFinal guess for the test output:\n\n[0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nBut considering the examples, perhaps a smaller grid. Alternatively:\n\n[0, 3, 3, 0]\n[3, 3, 3, 3]\n[0, 3, 3, 0]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Since the test input has 3s in various columns, perhaps the output will have a few rows with 3s in varying positions. Given the time, I'll settle on an answer that seems plausible based on the examples.",
