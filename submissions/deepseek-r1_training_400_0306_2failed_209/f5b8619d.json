        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input matrices are transformed into the output matrices.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput is a 3x3 matrix. The output is a 6x6 matrix. The original entries are 2 and 0s. The output has 2s, 8s, and 0s. Let me see the positions. The original 2s are at the corners (0,0) and (2,2). In the output, each original row becomes two rows. For instance, the first input row [2,0,0] becomes two rows: [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8]. Then the next input row [0,0,0] becomes two rows with 8s and 0s. It looks like each element in the input is being expanded into a 2x2 block in the output. But how exactly?\n\nLooking at the 2 in the input, maybe each non-zero number is replaced by a 2x2 block where the number is at the corners and 8s in between. For example, a 2 in the input might become a 2 in the top-left and bottom-right of a 2x2 block, with 8s in the other positions. So 2 becomes [[2,8],[8,2]]? But then the output rows for the first input row [2,0,0] would be [2,8,0..., 8,2, etc. Wait, let's check the actual output.\n\nOriginal input row 0: [2,0,0]. Output rows 0 and 1 are [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8]. Hmm, perhaps each element in the input is transformed into two elements in the output row. Wait, the input rows are length 3, and output rows are length 6. So each element is expanded into two elements. For example, a 0 becomes two 0s? But in the output, there are 8s as well. So maybe each element is being replaced by a pair, where non-zero elements are followed by 8, or something else.\n\nWait, looking at the first input element 2 in Example 0: in the output, the first two elements are 2 and 0? No, the first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Wait, the input row is [2,0,0]. So each input element is transformed into two elements. Let's split the output row into groups of two:\n\nFor [2,0,0], the output row is split as [2,0 | 8,2 | 0,8]. Wait, maybe each input element is being turned into a pair, but the transformation depends on adjacent elements. Alternatively, maybe there's a tiling or mirroring with some pattern involving 8s when non-zero numbers are present.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output dimensions. For Example 0, input is 3x3, output is 6x6. So each dimension is doubled. Similarly, Example 1 input is 6x6, output is 12x12 (since each row in output has 12 elements and there are 12 rows). Example 2 input is 2x2, output is 4x4. So the pattern is that each input matrix is scaled by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. So each element in the input becomes a 2x2 block in the output.\n\nNow, how is each 2x2 block determined based on the input element?\n\nLooking at Example 0: input element 2 becomes in output two rows. For example, the first input row [2,0,0] becomes two rows. The first output row for that input row is [2, 0, 8, 2, 0, 8]. Wait, perhaps each input row is duplicated and modified. Let's look at each cell in the input:\n\nFor the 2 in position (0,0) of the input:\n\nIn the output, the first two rows and first two columns would be:\n\nRow 0: [2, 0, ...]\nRow 1: [8, 0, ...]\n\nWait, but the first two elements in the first output row are 2 and 0. Then the next two elements are 8 and 2. Hmm, maybe the input cell (i,j) is transformed into a 2x2 block in the output at positions (2i, 2j), (2i, 2j+1), (2i+1, 2j), (2i+1, 2j+1). The values in these positions depend on the original cell's value and possibly neighboring cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input cell is replaced by a specific 2x2 pattern. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, input 2:\n\nLooking at the output block for the 2 at (0,0). The output's first two rows' first two elements are 2,0 and 8,0? Wait, no. The first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So the first two elements are 2 and 0, then next two are 8 and 2, etc. Wait, maybe each input cell is split into two elements in the row direction. Wait, perhaps each row is being repeated with some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each row is duplicated, but modified. For Example 0, the input has three rows. The output has six rows. Each input row becomes two output rows. Let's check:\n\nInput row 0: [2,0,0] becomes output rows 0 and 1: [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8]. Then input row 1: [0,0,0] becomes output rows 2 and 3: [8,0,8,8,0,8] and [8,0,2,8,0,2]. Wait, no. Wait the output rows for example 0 are:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow 1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nRow 2: [8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nRow 3: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow 4: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nRow 5: [8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nWait, that's six rows. But the input is 3 rows, so each input row is duplicated into two output rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire input is mirrored or repeated. For example, the output is the original input repeated twice in some way. Looking at example 0's output, the first three rows are followed by the same three rows again. So rows 0-2 and 3-5 are the same. So the output is the original input scaled up by 2x2 blocks and then repeated.\n\nBut that's a bit vague. Let's look at another example. Example 2: input is 2x2, output is 4x4. The input is:\n\n[0,4]\n[0,0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n[0,8,0,8]\n[0,4,0,4]\n[0,8,0,8]\n\nSo here, each input row becomes two rows. For the first input row [0,4], the output rows are [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. The second input row [0,0] becomes [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. Wait, but the original input's second row is all zeros, but the output rows have 4 and 8. Hmm, maybe there's a different pattern here. For the 4 in the input's first row, the output has 4 in the original position and in the next column, and 8s in the next row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input element is being duplicated horizontally and vertically, but with some modification. For example, the 4 in the input is in position (0,1). In the output, this becomes two columns (so 1*2=2 and 3?), but the output has 0,4,0,4. So 4 is repeated twice in the same row. Then the next row in the output for that input row has 0,8,0,8. So perhaps the 4 is replaced by 4 and 4 in the same row, and then 8 and 8 in the row below. Similarly, 0s in the input become 0s in the same row and 8s below? Or maybe 0s are replaced by 0 and 0 in the same row, but when adjacent to a non-zero, they are replaced with 8s?\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to find a rule for each input cell's transformation into a 2x2 block.\n\nLet's take Example 0's first cell (0,0) with value 2. In the output, the corresponding 2x2 block would be:\n\n[2, 0]\n\n[8, 8]\n\nWait, no. Because the first two rows of the output are:\n\nRow 0: [2, 0, 8, 2, 0, 8]\n\nRow 1: [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8]\n\nSo the first two elements of row 0 are 2 and 0. Then row 1's first two elements are 8 and 0. So the 2x2 block for input cell (0,0) (value 2) is:\n\nRow 0: 2, 0\n\nRow 1: 8, 0\n\nWait, but the next two elements in row 0 are 8, 2. That's for the next input cell (0,1) which is 0. Hmm, this doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe each input cell is expanded into two elements in the row and the row is duplicated with modifications.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input row is transformed by inserting a new row after it, which is modified. For example, take the input row, create a copy where certain elements are replaced with 8s. For instance, for input cell with value x, the original row has x and some other value, and the next row replaces x with 8 if x is non-zero.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 0's first input row [2,0,0]. The first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. The second output row is [8,0,8,8,0,8]. So the original row elements are expanded into pairs. For each element in the input row, maybe we have a pair where the first element is the original value, and the second is 8 if the original is non-zero, else 0. Then, the next row is all 8s for non-zero elements and 0s otherwise. Wait, let's check:\n\nInput element 2 in position (0,0) becomes [2,8] in the first output row's first two elements, but in the first output row, it's 2 and 0. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, the first input row [2,0,0] becomes output rows [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8]. So each input element is being transformed into two elements. Let's see:\n\nFor 2: first element in the pair is 2, then 0. Then in the next row, 8 and 0.\n\nFor 0: in the first output row's pair, 8 and 2. Then next pair is 0 and 8. Wait, no. Wait the input row is [2,0,0]. The first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So the first two elements correspond to the 2: 2 and 0. Then the next two elements (8,2) correspond to the 0. Then the next two (0,8) correspond to the 0. But that doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps each input row is being mirrored with some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input matrix is being expanded by a factor of 2 in each dimension, and the new cells are filled with 8s except when adjacent to original non-zero elements, which are filled with 2s again. But how?\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, the 8s are dominant. So maybe the pattern is to create a larger matrix where the original elements are placed in specific positions, and the rest are filled with 8s, but with some exceptions. For example, in Example 0, the output has 2s in the corners and 8s elsewhere. But the first output row has 2,0,8,2,0,8. Wait, the 0s are present. So that idea may not hold.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input:\n\n[0,4]\n[0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n[0,8,0,8]\n[0,4,0,4]\n[0,8,0,8]\n\nEach input row is transformed into two rows. For the first input row [0,4], the output rows are [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. For the second input row [0,0], the output rows are [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. Hmm, interesting. So even the 0s in the input are transformed into 4 and 8 in some way. Wait, no. The output's 4s and 8s seem to be coming from the original 4 in the input. So perhaps the 4 is being replicated in a pattern. For the first input row, the 4 is at position (0,1). In the output, this becomes 4 in the same position and mirrored next to it. Then the next row for that input row has 8s in those positions.\n\nMaybe the rule is: for each non-zero element in the input, when expanding, it creates copies of itself in the same row and the row below, with 8s replacing some of the copies. For example, a non-zero x in the input would create x and x in the same output row (expanded), then 8 and 8 in the row below. But in Example 0's first row, the output rows are [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8]. Wait, the 2 is followed by 0, then 8 and 2. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input cell is transformed into a 2x2 block where the original value is in the top-left, 8 in the top-right, 8 in the bottom-left, and the original value in the bottom-right. So for a cell with value x, the block is:\n\nx 8\n\n8 x\n\nSo for Example 0's first cell (2), the block would be:\n\n2 8\n\n8 2\n\nBut looking at the output rows for that example, the first two elements of the first row are 2 and 0. Wait, that doesn't match. So perhaps this is not the case.\n\nAnother approach: look for symmetry. In Example 0's output, each row seems to mirror itself. For example, the first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which is symmetrical around the center. The same for the other rows. So perhaps the output is created by mirroring each row. For example, each row is the original row followed by its mirror image with some transformation. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input row in Example 0: [2,0,0]. If mirrored, it becomes [0,0,2]. Then, combining the original and mirrored with some modifications. The output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. The first three elements might be [2,0,8], and then the next three are the mirror [2,0,8], but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the input row is duplicated and modified, then mirrored.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking each input row, expanding it by inserting elements in between. For example, inserting 8s and original elements. For the first input row [2,0,0], maybe after each element, insert 8 and the original element again. So 2 becomes 2, 8, 2; 0 becomes 0,8,0. But the output row has [2,0,8,2,0,8], which would be 2,0 followed by 8,2, then 0,8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is being tiled with some overlapping. For example, each input row is repeated twice with some shift. But I'm not seeing it clearly.\n\nLet's check Example 1. Input is 6x6, output 12x12. The input has a 5 in some positions. The output has 5s and 8s. For example, the fifth input row is [5,0,0,0,0,5]. The corresponding output rows are:\n\n[5,8,0,0,0,5,5,8,0,0,0,5]\n\nand the next row is [8,8,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nSo the 5 in the input row becomes in the output's first row: 5,8 and then later 5,8. The next row is 8,8 and 8,8. So for a 5 in the input, the corresponding 2x2 block in the output is:\n\n5 8\n\n8 8\n\nBut wait, the output has 5,8 in the first part and 5,8 again. Wait, perhaps the input is being duplicated with some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input element is replaced with a pair: the element itself and 8 if the element is non-zero, else 0. Then, each row is duplicated, with the second row having 8s wherever the original element was non-zero, and 0s otherwise.\n\nFor example, take an input row [a, b, c]. The first output row would be [a, (8 if a!=0 else 0), b, (8 if b!=0 else 0), c, (8 if c!=0 else 0)]. The second output row for that input row would be [ (8 if a!=0 else 0), (8 if a!=0 else 0), (8 if b!=0 else 0), (8 if b!=0 else 0), (8 if c!=0 else 0), (8 if c!=0 else 0) ].\n\nLet's test this with Example 0:\n\nInput row [2,0,0]. First output row would be [2,8, 0,0, 0,0], but the actual first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother possibility: Each input element is transformed into a 2x2 block where the top-left is the original value, top-right is 8 if the next element (to the right) is non-zero, bottom-left is 8 if the element below is non-zero, and bottom-right is the original value again. But that's complicated and may require checking neighbors.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row [2,0,0]. The output rows for this would be:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nSo the first two elements (2,0) and next two (8,2), etc. If the input element is 2, then the block could be:\n\n2 0\n\n8 8\n\nBut then for the next element 0, perhaps:\n\n0 8\n\n8 0\n\nBut in the output, the next two elements are 8 and 2, which doesn't fit. This approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is mirrored and combined with 8s. For instance, the original row is followed by a modified mirrored version. For example, [2,0,0] becomes [2,0,0] + [0,0,2] with some changes. But the output rows are longer than that.\n\nWait, let's count the elements. Input rows in Example 0 are 3 elements. Output rows are 6 elements, which is 3*2. So each element is expanded into two elements. Similarly, in Example 2, input rows are 2 elements, output rows are 4 elements. So each element becomes two.\n\nSo for each element in the input row, generate two elements in the output row. The way to generate them depends on the element's value and possibly its position.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first element 2:\n\nIn the first output row, the first two elements are 2 and 0. In the second output row for that input row, the first two elements are 8 and 0. So for input 2, the two elements generated are:\n\nRow 0: 2, 0\n\nRow 1: 8, 0\n\nFor input 0, maybe the elements are 8 and 2? Wait, no. Looking at the input row [2,0,0], the third and fourth elements in the first output row are 8 and 2. Then the fifth and sixth are 0 and 8. So for the second input element (0), the two elements are 8 and 2. For the third input element (0), the two elements are 0 and 8.\n\nThis is inconsistent. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input element is followed by 8 if it's non-zero, and 0 otherwise. Then, the next row has 8 followed by the original element if non-zero, else 0. For example:\n\nFor input element x:\n\nRow 0: x, 8 if x != 0 else 0\n\nRow 1: 8 if x != 0 else 0, x\n\nBut let's test this:\n\nExample 0's first input element is 2. So Row 0: 2, 8. Row 1: 8, 2.\n\nBut in the actual output, the first two elements of row 0 are 2,0. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the input is being expanded by inserting 8s between elements and then mirrored. For example, each input row is converted into a row where each element is followed by an 8, then the entire row is mirrored. So for input row [2,0,0], inserting 8s would give [2,8,0,8,0,8], then mirroring it would give [2,8,0,8,0,8] followed by reversed version. But the first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the input matrix is being converted into a larger matrix where each original element is followed by an 8 and the row is duplicated. For example, each input row becomes two rows: the first is the original elements with 8s inserted after each, and the second row is all 8s except where the original elements were non-zero. But this is vague.\n\nLooking at Example 2 again:\n\nInput row [0,4] becomes output rows [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. So each element is duplicated. For 0: 0 and 4. Wait, no. The first element is 0 in the input, which becomes 0 and 4 in the output? That doesn't make sense. Unless there's a vertical dependency. Maybe the 4 in the second column affects the previous elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a non-zero element is present in a row, it affects the expansion of the previous elements. For example, the 4 in the first row of Example 2 causes the preceding 0 to become 0,4, and the next row to have 0,8. But this is speculative.\n\nLet's think about the Test Input. The Test Input is a 4x4 matrix:\n\n[0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n[3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nApplying the pattern, the output should be 8x8 (since 4x4 input becomes 8x8 output). Each input row becomes two output rows. Let's try to derive the transformation based on examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2: input [0,4] becomes [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. So for each element in the input row:\n\n- If the element is non-zero (like 4), then in the first output row, it's duplicated (4,4), and in the second output row, replaced with 8,8.\n\n- If the element is zero, then in the first output row, it's duplicated (0,0), but in the second row, replaced with 8,8.\n\nWait, no. For the input row [0,4], the first output row is [0,4,0,4], which is 0 followed by 4, then 0 and 4. So each element is duplicated, but for 0 it's 0,0, and for 4 it's 4,4. But that's not the case. Wait, the input row is [0,4], which becomes [0,4,0,4]. So each element is followed by the same value. Then the next output row is [0,8,0,8], which replaces each element with 0 followed by 8, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is mirrored. For example, [0,4] becomes [0,4,0,4], which is [0,4] followed by [0,4]. Then the next row is [0,8,0,8], which is [0,8] followed by [0,8]. So the mirroring is done for each pair.\n\nBut how does this apply to Example 0?\n\nExample 0's first input row [2,0,0] becomes [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8]. If each element is duplicated and then mirrored with some rules:\n\nOriginal elements: 2,0,0.\n\nDuplicated: 2,2,0,0,0,0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is the original elements followed by their copies with 8s inserted. For example, 2 becomes 2 and 8, then 0 becomes 0 and 2. Wait, not sure.\n\nAnother angle: notice that in all the output examples, the non-zero numbers from the input are present in the output, but surrounded by 8s. For example, in Example 0's output, the 2s are at the corners and in the middle, surrounded by 8s. This suggests that the original non-zero numbers are placed in specific positions in the output, and the rest are filled with 8s. But there's also 0s in the output, so it's not just 8s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a convolution of the input with a kernel. For example, each non-zero element creates a 2x2 pattern, and overlapping patterns are summed. But the outputs don't have numbers other than the original and 8s. For instance, Example 0's output has 2s and 8s, no sums like 10.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's output, the 2s are placed in a pattern that mirrors the original positions. The original 2s were at (0,0) and (2,2). In the output, there are 2s at positions (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3), (5,2), (5,5), etc. This suggests that the output is a tiling of the input matrix mirrored or repeated in some way.\n\nAlternatively, the output matrix is formed by placing the original matrix and its mirrored versions (horizontal and vertical) in a larger grid. For example, the input is placed in the top-left corner, mirrored on the top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right, creating a 4x4 grid. But Example 0's input is 3x3, output is 6x6, so that would fit 2x2 tiling. But the actual output of Example 0 is different; the 2s are not just mirrored but placed in a pattern that repeats.\n\nAnother possible pattern is that each row is duplicated and the duplicated row has 8s in positions where the original row had non-zero elements. For example, in Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], the first output row is the same as the input, but expanded with some 8s. The second row for that input would have 8s where the original elements were non-zero. But in the actual output, the second row is [8,0,8,8,0,8]. So for the first element (2), it's replaced with 8, but the third element (0) becomes 8. That doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, each input row is transformed into two output rows where the first row has the original elements and 8s alternately, and the second row has all 8s except where the original elements were non-zero. But again, not sure.\n\nLet's try to find a pattern for transforming each input cell into two elements in the row and two rows.\n\nFor each input cell (i,j):\n\nThe output cell at (2i, 2j) is the same as the input value.\n\nThe output cell at (2i, 2j+1) is 8 if the input cell is non-zero, else 0.\n\nThe output cell at (2i+1, 2j) is 8 if the input cell is non-zero, else 0.\n\nThe output cell at (2i+1, 2j+1) is the same as the input value.\n\nSo for example, input cell with value 2 would produce:\n\n[2, 8]\n\n[8, 2]\n\nInput cell with value 0:\n\n[0, 0]\n\n[0, 0]\n\nLet's test this with Example 0:\n\nInput row 0: [2,0,0]\n\nEach cell is transformed into 2x2 blocks:\n\n2 \u2192 [[2,8],[8,2]]\n\n0 \u2192 [[0,0],[0,0]]\n\n0 \u2192 [[0,0],[0,0]]\n\nSo the first output row would be:\n\n2,8, 0,0, 0,0\n\nSecond output row:\n\n8,2, 0,0, 0,0\n\nBut the actual output rows for the first input row are [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8]. This doesn't match. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait, the actual output row for the first input row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So perhaps the elements are arranged differently. Maybe the input cell's 2x2 block is placed as:\n\nFor cell (i,j):\n\n(2i, j*2) = value\n\n(2i, j*2+1) = 8 if value !=0 else 0\n\n(2i+1, j*2) = 8 if value !=0 else 0\n\n(2i+1, j*2+1) = value\n\nBut let's see:\n\nFor input row 0, cell (0,0) is 2:\n\nSo (0,0) \u2192 2\n\n(0,1) \u21928\n\n(1,0) \u21928\n\n(1,1) \u21922\n\nBut then the first two elements of row 0 would be 2,8. But in the actual output, the first two elements are 2,0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps each input row is transformed into two output rows where the first row is the original elements followed by their values mirrored, and the second row is 8s followed by mirrored 8s. But how does that fit with Example 2's output?\n\nExample 2's input row [0,4] becomes [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. So mirrored, yes. Original row is [0,4], mirrored is [4,0], but the output row is [0,4,0,4]. It's not mirrored; it's the original row repeated twice. So [0,4] \u2192 [0,4,0,4]. Then the next row is [0,8,0,8].\n\nSo perhaps each input row is duplicated in the output, with each element repeated twice, but in the duplicated rows, non-zero elements are replaced with 8s.\n\nSo for example, for input row [0,4], the first output row is [0,4,0,4], which is each element repeated. The second output row is [0,8,0,8], which is 0 repeated and 4 replaced by 8.\n\nThen, for input row [0,0], the output rows are [0,0,0,0] and [0,0,0,0], but in Example 2's output, the rows are [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8], which doesn't fit. So this can't be the case.\n\nBut in Example 2's input, the second row is [0,0], and in the output, those rows are also transformed into [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. So it's not based on the current row's elements, but possibly on other rows. That complicates things.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 2's output, the 4 from the first row is replicated in all the output rows, even where the input row was zeros. This suggests that there's a vertical replication or dependency. Maybe the non-zero elements are being replicated vertically and horizontally, but this is not clear.\n\nLet's think about the Test Input. The Test Input has 3s in positions (0,2), (2,3), and (3,0). According to the examples, the output should have 3s in certain positions and 8s elsewhere. But how?\n\nFor example, if each 3 in the input becomes a 2x2 block of [3,8;8,3], then in the output, each 3 would be surrounded by 8s. But in Example 0's output, the 2s are placed in the corners of their respective 2x2 blocks. So perhaps the rule is: each non-zero element x in the input is replaced by a 2x2 block:\n\nx 8\n\n8 x\n\nBut how does this fit with Example 0's output?\n\nExample 0's first input row [2,0,0] would become:\n\n2 8 | 0 0 | 0 0\n\n8 2 | 0 0 | 0 0\n\nBut the actual output rows for this input row are [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8]. This doesn't align. For example, the first two elements of the first output row are 2 and 0, not 2 and 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blocks are placed with some overlapping. For example, the input matrix is convolved with a kernel that places x in the top-left and bottom-right, and 8 in the other positions, and then the overlapping elements are summed. But the outputs don't show summation (they have only 0s, 8s, and the original numbers).\n\nAlternatively, the input matrix is expanded by a factor of 2 in each dimension, and each cell is replaced with a 2x2 block where:\n\n- The top-left is the original value.\n\n- The top-right is 8 if the next cell to the right is non-zero.\n\n- The bottom-left is 8 if the cell below is non-zero.\n\n- The bottom-right is the original value.\n\nBut this would require checking neighboring cells. Let's test this with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row is [2,0,0]. The cell (0,0) is 2. To the right is 0, below is 0 (since row 1 is [0,0,0]).\n\nSo the block for (0,0) would be:\n\n2 (top-left)\n\n8 if next cell is non-zero (0) \u2192 no, so 0.\n\n8 if cell below is non-zero (0) \u2192 no, so 0.\n\nOriginal value: 2.\n\nSo the block is:\n\n2 0\n\n0 2\n\nBut in the output, the first two rows for this input are [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8]. The first two elements are 2 and 0, then 8 and 2. This doesn't fit. So this rule doesn't work.\n\nAt this point, I'm struggling to find a consistent pattern. Let's try to look for another approach.\n\nIn Example 0's output, each original row is transformed into two rows, and the output matrix is twice the size. Also, the output matrix seems to have a pattern where each row is a combination of the original elements and their mirror images, but with 8s inserted. For example, the first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. This looks like the original row [2,0,0] followed by [2,0,8], but not exactly. Alternatively, it's the original row elements separated by 8s and mirrored.\n\nAnother idea: the output matrix is created by horizontally concatenating the input matrix with a modified version of itself, and vertically concatenating the same. For example, each row is duplicated with some transformation. But this is too vague.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, there are 5s and 8s. The input has 5s in certain positions. The output rows for the fifth input row [5,0,0,0,0,5] are:\n\n[5,8,0,0,0,5,5,8,0,0,0,5]\n\n[8,8,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nSo each 5 is replaced with 5,8 in the first row and 8,8 in the second. Then, the entire row is duplicated. So perhaps each input element is transformed into two elements in the row: x and 8 if x is non-zero, else 0 and 0. Then, the next row has 8 and 8 for non-zero elements, and 0 and 0 for zeros. But this doesn't explain all elements.\n\nAlternatively, each input element is transformed into two elements: the first row has x followed by 8 if non-zero, else 0 followed by 0. The second row has 8 followed by x if non-zero, else 0 followed by 0.\n\nFor example, input element 5:\n\nRow 0: 5,8\n\nRow 1: 8,5\n\nInput element 0:\n\nRow 0: 0,0\n\nRow 1: 0,0\n\nSo for input row [5,0], the output rows would be [5,8,0,0] and [8,5,0,0]. But in Example 1's output, the fifth row is [5,8,0,0,0,5,5,8,0,0,0,5]. This suggests that after expanding each element into two, the row is duplicated with some modifications. \n\nWait, the input row [5,0,0,0,0,5] becomes in the output:\n\n[5,8,0,0,0,5,5,8,0,0,0,5]\n\nThis is the original row expanded into pairs: 5\u21925,8; 0\u21920,0; 0\u21920,0; 0\u21920,0; 0\u21920,0; 5\u21925,8. Then concatenated with the same row again. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the input row is mirrored. So the original row [5,0,0,0,0,5] becomes [5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,5], but with some elements replaced by 8s. \n\nBut the output row has 5,8,0,0,0,5,5,8,0,0,0,5. So it's the original elements followed by their mirrors, with non-zero elements followed by 8s.\n\nHmm. This is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for another pattern: the output matrix is the input matrix scaled by a factor of 2, with each non-zero element x replaced by a pattern that includes x and 8s, and zeros replaced by 0s and 8s based on their position or neighboring elements.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by interleaving the input matrix with 8s. For example, each row is interleaved with 8s and the original elements. But in Example 0's first output row, it's [2,0,8,2,0,8]. This looks like 2,0 followed by 8,2, then 0,8. So perhaps the pattern is: for each pair of elements in the input row, insert 8s between them. Not sure.\n\nAnother possible approach: look for the presence of 8s. The number 8 appears in positions where there's a connection between non-zero elements. For example, in Example 0, the 2s are connected via 8s. Or maybe 8s represent edges between non-zero cells.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input matrix as a grid where non-zero numbers are nodes, and 8s are edges connecting them. But I'm not sure how this applies.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll try to hypothesize a rule based on the examples:\n\nIt seems that each input element is replaced by a 2x2 block. For non-zero elements x:\n\nThe block is:\n\nx 8\n\n8 x\n\nBut when looking at Example 0's output, this doesn't fit. However, in Example 2's output, the 4 is replaced by 4 and 4 in the first row, and 8 and 8 in the next row. So perhaps the rule is:\n\nEach non-zero element x is replaced by a vertical block of x and x in the first output row for that input row, and 8 and 8 in the next row. Zeros are replaced by 0 and 0 in the first row, and 0 and 0 in the next row. But in Example 2's output, the 0s in the input become 0 and 4 in the first output row, which contradicts this.\n\nWait, Example 2's input row [0,4] becomes output rows [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. So for the 0, it's replaced by 0 and 4 in the first row. This doesn't fit any logical pattern unless there's a dependency on the neighboring elements. For example, the 4 in the same row affects the 0's transformation. But I can't see how.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on Example 2 and Example 0, it seems that each row is transformed by duplicating each element and then mirroring the entire row with some replacements. For example, in Example 2's input row [0,4], the output row is [0,4,0,4], which is the original row mirrored and each element duplicated. Then the next row is [0,8,0,8], which replaces non-zero elements with 8.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\nFor each input row, create two output rows:\n\n1. The first output row is the original row with each element duplicated, followed by the mirrored original row with each element duplicated.\n\n2. The second output row is the same as the first, but with all non-zero elements replaced by 8.\n\nWait, in Example 2:\n\nInput row [0,4].\n\nFirst output row: [0,4,0,4] (original duplicated and mirrored duplicated).\n\nSecond output row: [0,8,0,8].\n\nThis fits.\n\nExample 0's first input row [2,0,0].\n\nOriginal duplicated: [2,0,0] \u2192 [2,2,0,0,0,0]. Mirrored duplicated: [0,0,2] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,2,2]. So combined, the first output row would be [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]. But the actual output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the mirrored row is [0,0,2], duplicated would be [0,0,0,0,2,2]. So original duplicated is [2,2,0,0,0,0]. Combined, the first output row is [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2], which doesn't match. So this rule doesn't apply.\n\nAnother possibility: Each input row is duplicated, and between each element, an 8 is inserted if the next element is non-zero, else 0. Then, mirrored. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAt this point, I think the most plausible pattern is that each input element is replaced by a 2x2 block where the original value is placed in the top-left and bottom-right, and 8s elsewhere if the element is non-zero. For zeros, it's 0s. So for a non-zero x:\n\nx 8\n\n8 x\n\nFor 0:\n\n0 0\n\n0 0\n\nBut let's test this:\n\nExample 0's first row [2,0,0]:\n\nBlock for 2:\n\n2 8\n\n8 2\n\nBlocks for 0s:\n\n0 0\n\n0 0\n\nSo the first two rows would be:\n\n2 8 0 0 0 0\n\n8 2 0 0 0 0\n\nBut the actual first two output rows are:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nThis doesn't match. So this rule is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without success, I'll have to make a best guess based on the examples. The output seems to have a pattern where each input row is transformed into two rows, with the original elements duplicated and 8s inserted, and the matrix is mirrored horizontally and vertically. For example, in Example 0, the output is the original matrix placed in the top-left and mirrored to the bottom-right, with 8s in between.\n\nFor the Test Input, which is a 4x4 matrix, applying this pattern would create an 8x8 matrix. Each input row becomes two output rows, and each element is duplicated with 8s inserted. For example, the first input row [0,0,3,0] would become two rows. For the 3 in the third position, it would become 3 and 8 in the first row, and 8 and 3 in the second row. The zeros would become 0 and 0 in the first row, and 0 and 0 in the second row. Then the entire matrix is mirrored. \n\nBut without a clear rule, I'll try to replicate the pattern from the examples. For instance, each non-zero element in the input is surrounded by 8s in the output, and the structure is mirrored. \n\nThe Test Input has 3s at (0,2), (2,3), and (3,0). Following the pattern from Example 1, where 5s are replicated with 8s around them, the output would have 3s in their positions, surrounded by 8s, and the rest filled with 0s and 8s based on proximity.\n\nBut since time is limited, I'll proceed with a possible answer based on Example 1's structure. Each non-zero element is expanded into a 2x2 block with the element and 8s, and the matrix is doubled in size. The output is created by expanding each row and column into two, inserting 8s around non-zero elements.\n\nSo for the Test Input, the output would be:\n\n[0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]\n\n[0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8]\n\n[3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nBut this is a guess. However, looking at the example outputs, the pattern seems to involve duplicating each row and column with 8s and original values. For example, in Example 0, each row is duplicated, and each element is followed by an 8 and the original value again. So [2,0,0] becomes [2,0,8,2,0,8], and the next row is [8,0,8,8,0,8]. Then this pattern is repeated.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input's first row [0,0,3,0], each element is replaced with itself and 8 if non-zero, else 0. So:\n\n0 \u2192 0,0\n\n0 \u2192 0,0\n\n3 \u2192 3,8\n\n0 \u2192 0,0\n\nBut the row is then followed by a row of 8s where non-zero elements were. So the first output row would be [0,0,0,0,3,8,0,0], but wait, that's length 8. Then the next row would be [8,0,8,0,8,3,8,0]. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, each element in the input row is converted to two elements in the output row: the original and 8 if non-zero, else 0. Then the next row is 8s in the positions of non-zero elements and 0s elsewhere.\n\nFor example, input element 3 becomes [3,8] in the first row and [8,8] in the second. Input 0 becomes [0,0] in both rows.\n\nSo for the Test Input's first row [0,0,3,0], the first output row would be:\n\n0,0, 0,0, 3,8, 0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,3,8,0,0]\n\nThe second output row for this input row would be:\n\n0,0, 0,0, 8,8, 0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0]\n\nRepeating this for all rows, then mirroring or repeating the structure.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on Example 1 and Example 2, the output seems to expand each row into two, with the first row having the original elements and 8s, and the second row having 8s. For example, each non-zero element is followed by an 8, and the row is duplicated with 8s. The entire structure may also be mirrored vertically and horizontally.\n\nGiven the complexity, I'll provide an answer based on expanding each element into a 2x2 block with the original element and 8s, then mirroring the matrix. However, given the time constraints, the exact pattern is unclear, so I'll proceed with this approach.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a matrix, and the output is a larger matrix. Let's start with Example 0. The input is a 3x3 matrix:\n\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 2]\n\nThe output is a 6x6 matrix. Each row in the output seems to be duplicated or expanded. For instance, the first row of the input is [2,0,0], and in the output, the first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Hmm, maybe each element in the input row is being transformed into a pair of elements. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input row: 2,0,0. Output row: 2,0,8, 2,0,8. Wait, splitting into parts: 2,0,8 and then 2,0,8. So maybe each element in the input row is replaced by two elements. But how? The first part is 2,0,8, which could be the original elements followed by some transformation. The 2 becomes 2 and 8? Or maybe there's a mirroring involved.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 0, each row in the output is duplicated twice. The original input rows are 3, output rows are 6. So each input row becomes two output rows. But how are the elements transformed?\n\nAnother observation: The numbers 8 and 2 appear in the output. Maybe the non-zero numbers in the input are kept, and zeros are replaced with 8s in some pattern. Or perhaps when a number is present, it's followed by an 8. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the first input row has a 2. The output row starts with 2,0,8. Wait, the original row is [2,0,0], and the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So maybe each element is mirrored with 8. Like, for each element in the input, we have the element followed by 8 if it's non-zero? Wait, but in the first output row, the 2 is followed by 0 and then 8. Hmm, maybe not. Let's break it down.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 0, each input row is transformed into two output rows. Let's take the first input row [2,0,0]. The output rows are [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8]. Wait, no. The output has 6 rows. Wait, the input is 3x3, the output is 6x6. So each row is transformed into two rows, and each column into two columns. So perhaps the output is a 2x scaling in both dimensions, but with some specific rules.\n\nLooking at the first input row [2,0,0], the output first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So each element in the input is expanded into two elements. But how? For 2, it becomes 2 and 8? Then 0 becomes 0 and 8? Then another 0 becomes 0 and 8. Wait, but the first part is 2,0,8, then repeats as 2,0,8. So maybe the original element is duplicated, and then followed by 8, but that doesn't quite fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is mirrored or tiled in some way. For example, the output matrix is created by tiling the input matrix in a certain pattern. Let's see the structure of the output in Example 0. The output for row 0 is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Then row 1 is [8,0,8,8,0,8]. Then row 2 is [8,0,2,8,0,2]. Then rows 3-5 repeat rows 0-2 again. So the output is a repetition of a block that's 3 rows, duplicated. Wait, the output is 6 rows, so 3 original rows become 6 by repeating each row twice. But the elements within each row are transformed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the input is replaced by a 2x2 block. Let's see. For example, the input 2 would become a 2x2 block. Let's check the output for Example 0. The input is 3x3, output is 6x6. So 3*2=6. So each element becomes a 2x2 block. Let's check the first input row [2,0,0]. The output rows 0 and 1 correspond to this input row. The first element is 2. So the 2x2 block for 2 might be [2,8][8,8]? Let's see:\n\nFirst two rows of output:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nLooking at the first two elements of these rows: 2 and 8, then 8 and 8. Wait, perhaps the 2 is replaced with [2,8] in the top row and [8,8] in the next. Then the 0 is replaced with [0,0] and [0,0], but in the output, the 0s are followed by 8s. Hmm, maybe not. Let's see the first input element is 2. In the output, the first two elements are 2 and 0 (in row 0), but that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2 is replaced by a 2x2 block where the top-left is 2, others are 8. So the block would be [2,8; 8,8]. Then for 0, maybe the block is [0,8; 8,8]. Let's test this.\n\nTake input row 0: [2,0,0]. Each element becomes a 2x2 block. So for 2: [2,8; 8,8], for 0: [0,8; 8,8], another 0: [0,8; 8,8]. Then combining these blocks horizontally:\n\nFirst two output rows would be:\n\n[2,8, 0,8, 0,8]\n[8,8, 8,8, 8,8]\n\nBut the actual output rows for Example 0 are:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nHmm, not matching. Maybe the blocks are different. Alternatively, perhaps each element is transformed into a pair where the original is followed by 8 if it's non-zero, else followed by 0. Wait, in the first row of output for Example 0, the 2 is followed by 0 and then 8, which doesn't fit that.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the outputs, the number 8 appears frequently. Maybe 8 is a filler number for expansion. Let's check the input and output dimensions.\n\nIn Example 0: input is 3x3, output is 6x6. So each dimension is doubled. So each element in the input is mapped to a 2x2 block in the output. The key is to find the pattern for each element's 2x2 block.\n\nLooking at the input element 2 in Example 0. Where does it appear in the output? The input's top-left corner (0,0) is 2. The output's first two rows and first two columns would correspond to this. The output's first row starts with 2,0,8... Wait, perhaps the 2 is placed in the top-left of its 2x2 block, and the rest are 8s. So the block for 2 is [2,8; 8,8]. Then the 0s in the input would be blocks of [0,8; 8,8]. Let's check:\n\nFor input row 0: [2,0,0], each element becomes a 2x2 block.\n\nFirst element 2: [2,8; 8,8]\nSecond element 0: [0,8; 8,8]\nThird element 0: [0,8; 8,8]\n\nSo combining horizontally, the first row of the blocks would be [2,8,0,8,0,8], and the second row would be [8,8,8,8,8,8]. But in the actual output, the first two rows are:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nHmm, this doesn't match. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to have a mirroring pattern. For Example 0, the output is symmetric. Let's look at the first row of output: [2,0,8,2,0,8]. It looks like the original row [2,0,0] is duplicated with some transformation. The first half is [2,0,8], and the second half is [2,0,8]. So perhaps each input row is duplicated with the original elements and then transformed elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by tiling the input matrix in a certain way, possibly with mirroring and adding 8s. For example, the input matrix is placed in the top-left, mirrored to the right, and 8s fill the gaps. But in Example 0's output, the first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So after the first three elements [2,0,8], the next three are [2,0,8]. But the original input row is [2,0,0]. Where does the 8 come from?\n\nWait, maybe each element is followed by an 8 if it's non-zero, and followed by 0 otherwise. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input row [2,0,0]. If non-zero elements are followed by 8, then 2 becomes 2,8; 0 becomes 0,0; another 0 becomes 0,0. So the transformed row would be [2,8,0,0,0,0]. But the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. That doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, each element is replaced by itself and then 8. So 2 becomes [2,8], 0 becomes [0,8]. Then the row [2,0,0] would become [2,8,0,8,0,8]. But in the output, the first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So perhaps the transformation is [element, 8] for each element, but then the next part of the row duplicates the original elements again. Wait, the output row for example 0's first row is 2,0,8 followed by 2,0,8. So maybe each element is transformed into a pair where the first is the original element and the second is 8, then the entire row is duplicated. But that would make [2,8,0,8,0,8, 2,8,0,8,0,8], which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 1: input is a 6x6 matrix, output is 12x12. So again, each dimension doubled. The input has 5s in certain positions, and the output has 5s and 8s. For instance, in the input, the first row is [0,5,0,0,0,0]. The output's first row is [8,5,0,0,0,8,8,5,0,0,0,8]. So the 5 is followed by 0s and 8s. Maybe the 5 is kept as is, and surrounding elements are filled with 8s and 0s according to some rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the input is expanded into a 2x2 block where:\n\n- For non-zero elements (like 2,5, etc.), their block is [element, 8; 8, 8].\n\n- For zero elements, the block is [0,8; 8,8].\n\nLet's test this for Example 0's first element 2:\n\nBlock would be:\n\n2 8\n\n8 8\n\nSo for the input row [2,0,0], the first element's block is 2,8; 8,8. The next two elements (0s) have blocks 0,8;8,8 each. Combining these horizontally for the first row:\n\nFirst row of blocks (top row of each 2x2):\n\n2,8,0,8,0,8\n\nSecond row of blocks:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nBut the actual output's first two rows are:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nThis doesn't match. So perhaps the block structure is different.\n\nWait, maybe for non-zero elements, the 2x2 block is:\n\nelement, 0\n\n8, element\n\nSo for 2:\n\n2 0\n\n8 2\n\nThen for 0:\n\n0 0\n\n8 0\n\nBut let's check Example 0's first row input [2,0,0]. The transformed blocks would be:\n\nFor 2: [2,0;8,2]\n\nFor each 0: [0,0;8,0]\n\nSo combining them horizontally:\n\nRow 0: 2,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 1:8,2,8,0,8,0\n\nBut the actual output is:\n\nRow0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions of the original elements in the output. For Example 0, the input is 3x3. The output is 6x6. Let's see where the original elements are placed. The input's (0,0) is 2. The output's (0,0) is 2. Then (0,3) is 2 again. So perhaps each input element is placed in the output at positions (2i, 2j) and (2i, 2j+3) for some repetition. Or perhaps mirrored in some way.\n\nLooking at the output rows of Example 0, the first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So positions 0 and 3 are 2, which might correspond to the original 2 in input row 0, column 0. Then the 0s are in positions 1 and 4, and 8s in positions 2,5. This seems like the original element is duplicated with some spacing and 8s in between.\n\nAlternatively, the input is replicated with 8s inserted. For example, each row in the input is mirrored with 8s in between. Like, for row [2,0,0], it becomes [2,0,0, 8, 2,0,0]. Wait, but that's not exactly matching. The output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Maybe after each original element, an 8 is added, then the original row is appended again. So [2,0,0] becomes [2,0,0,8,2,0,0,8], but the output row is length 6. Hmm, not quite.\n\nLooking at Example 2: input is 2x2, output is 4x4. The input is:\n\n[0,4]\n[0,0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n[0,8,0,8]\n[0,4,0,4]\n[0,8,0,8]\n\nSo each input row is duplicated. For row [0,4], the output rows are [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. Then repeated again. So for the 4, which is non-zero, in the duplicated row, the 4 is replaced with 8. So maybe in even rows (original rows) the elements are kept, and in the duplicated rows (odd rows), the non-zero elements become 8, zeros remain 0. But looking at the output rows for Example 2: the second row is [0,8,0,8], which would be the transformed version of [0,4], replacing 4 with 8. Then the same pattern repeats.\n\nSo the pattern could be: each input row is duplicated. The first copy is the original elements followed by the original elements again (like tiling), and the second copy is the original elements with non-zeros replaced by 8, followed by the same. Wait, but in Example 2's output, the first row is [0,4,0,4]. So the original row [0,4] is followed by [0,4] again. The next row is [0,8,0,8], which is [0,4] transformed to [0,8] followed by [0,8]. Then this repeats.\n\nSo for each input row, you generate two output rows. The first output row is the input row concatenated with itself (each element duplicated next to itself), but with zeros remaining and non-zeros duplicated. Then the second output row is the same, but non-zeros are replaced with 8. Then this pair of rows is repeated again.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input row [0,4] becomes:\n\nFirst output row: [0,4,0,4] (original elements duplicated)\n\nSecond output row: [0,8,0,8] (non-zeros replaced with 8)\n\nThen this pair is repeated again. So for a 2x2 input, the output is 4x4, which is 2 input rows * 2 (each row becomes two rows), and each input column becomes two columns. But in this case, each input element is duplicated in the row, then the row is transformed again.\n\nBut how does this apply to other examples?\n\nLet's check Example 0. The input row [2,0,0]. Following Example 2's pattern, the first transformed row would be [2,2,0,0,0,0], but in the actual output, the first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, each element is mirrored, inserting 8 between them. For example, each element is followed by 8, and then the original row is appended again with the same transformation. So for [2,0,0], it becomes [2,8,0,8,0,8] and then [2,8,0,8,0,8] again? But the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking each input row, then mirroring it with 8s in between. For example, [2,0,0] becomes [2,0,0, 8, 2,0,0, 8], but again, the actual output row is shorter. \n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output. The first row of the input is [0,5,0,0,0,0]. The output's first row is [8,5,0,0,0,8,8,5,0,0,0,8]. So the input row is transformed into a row where the 5 is placed with 8s around. The structure here seems to be that non-zero elements are surrounded by 8s, and zeros are kept. But how?\n\nAnother angle: The output in all examples has even dimensions, which are double the input's dimensions. Each element in the input is transformed into a 2x2 block. Let's see if there's a pattern in how the elements are transformed.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input [0,4] and the output blocks:\n\nOriginal 0 becomes 0 and 4 becomes 4 in the first row, then 0 and 8 in the second row. Wait, the output rows are:\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n[0,8,0,8]\n[0,4,0,4]\n[0,8,0,8]\n\nSo for each input element (0 and 4), in the first output row of the block, it's duplicated (0\u21920,0; 4\u21924,4), but in the next row, 0 remains 0,0 and 4 becomes 8,8. So perhaps for each input element, the 2x2 block is:\n\n[element, element]\n[if element is non-zero: 8, else 0; same for the other]\n\nSo for 4:\n\n[4,4]\n[8,8]\n\nFor 0:\n\n[0,0]\n[0,0]\n\nBut in Example 2's output, the first row is [0,4,0,4], which is 0 and 4 each appearing twice. Then the second row is [0,8,0,8], which is 0 followed by 8 twice. Wait, so for the input 0, the block is:\n\n0,0\n0,0\n\nBut for input 4, the block is:\n\n4,4\n8,8\n\nBut in Example 2's output, the first row for the input 4 is [0,4,0,4], which would be the first row of each block:\n\nFor the first element 0: [0,0], and the second element 4: [4,4], giving [0,0,4,4], but the actual first row is [0,4,0,4]. Hmm, maybe each element's block is arranged horizontally. Wait, maybe each element is expanded into two columns. So for each row, each element becomes two elements. For non-zero elements, the first is the original value, the second is 8. For zeros, the first is 0, the second is 8. Then each row is duplicated, but the duplicated row has non-zero elements replaced with 8.\n\nWait, let's try this for Example 0's first input row [2,0,0].\n\nExpanding each element into two elements:\n\n2 becomes [2,8], 0 becomes [0,8], 0 becomes [0,8]. So the expanded row is [2,8,0,8,0,8]. Then this row is followed by another row where each non-zero element is replaced with 8. So the second row would be [8,8,8,8,8,8]. But in the actual output, the first two rows are:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the expansion is different. Like, each element is followed by 0 if it's non-zero, else 8. So for 2: [2,0], 0: [0,8]. Then the row becomes [2,0,0,8,0,8]. But Example 0's first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each row is mirrored with some transformation. For Example 0's first input row [2,0,0], the output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So it's the original row, then 8, then the original row again, then 8. But how?\n\nWait, the output row for Example 0's first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. So it's as if the original row [2,0,0] is followed by [2,0,0] again, but with the third element replaced with 8. Or perhaps there's a pattern where each element is followed by 8 and then the original row repeats. But not sure.\n\nLet's think about the dimensions again. The input is an N x M matrix, output is 2N x 2M. So each element is transformed into a 2x2 block. So for each element in the input, we have a 2x2 block in the output. The key is to determine what the block is for each element (zero or non-zero).\n\nLooking at Example 2's input element 4 (non-zero) in position (0,1). The output blocks for this element are:\n\nIn row 0: 4 and 4 (columns 1 and 3 of row 0)\n\nIn row 1: 8 and 8 (columns 1 and 3 of row 1)\n\nSo the block for non-zero 4 is:\n\n4 4\n\n8 8\n\nFor zero elements in Example 2, like position (0,0):\n\nIn rows 0 and 2: 0 and 0\n\nIn rows 1 and 3: 0 and 0\n\nSo the block for 0 is:\n\n0 0\n\n0 0\n\nBut wait, the output for Example 2's first row is [0,4,0,4], which is the original row duplicated. The second row is [0,8,0,8], which is the original row with non-zero elements replaced by 8 and duplicated. Then this pattern repeats.\n\nSo maybe the rule is:\n\n- Each row in the input is processed into two rows in the output.\n\n- The first row of the output for an input row is the original row elements duplicated (each element appears twice).\n\n- The second row of the output for an input row is the original row elements replaced by 8 if non-zero, duplicated.\n\nThen, this pair of rows is repeated again, making the total output rows double the input.\n\nWait, Example 2's input is 2x2, output is 4x4. Each input row becomes two rows, duplicated again. So for each input row, four output rows? But the output has four rows, which would be 2 input rows * 2 each. Hmm, Example 2's input is 2 rows, output is 4 rows, which fits. For each input row, generate two output rows (original and transformed), then repeat them again. So for input row 0: [0,4], output rows are [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8], and then these two rows are repeated again. So total four rows.\n\nIf that's the case, then for Example 0's input row [2,0,0], the first output row would be [2,0,0,2,0,0], but the actual output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe the duplication is with 8 inserted between.\n\nAnother approach: Looking for the position of the original elements in the output. For Example 0's input element 2 at (0,0) and (2,2). The output has 2 at (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3), and 8s around. Maybe the output is created by placing the original matrix in each quadrant of the output, with 8s in between. For a 3x3 input, the output would be split into four 3x3 quadrants, but the output is 6x6, so each quadrant is 3x3. But then where are the 8s?\n\nAlternatively, the input matrix is mirrored along both axes with 8s filling the spaces. For Example 0's input, the output is the input matrix surrounded by 8s in a mirrored fashion. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation involves placing the input matrix in the output, then flipping it horizontally and vertically, replacing certain elements with 8s. This might explain the symmetry in the output.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the first three rows are:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\n[8,0,2,8,0,2]\n\nThen rows 4-6 are a repeat of rows 1-3. So the pattern repeats after three rows, but the output is 6 rows. This suggests that each input row is transformed into two output rows, but the entire matrix is then repeated.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by concatenating the input matrix with a modified version of itself. For example, in Example 0, the first three rows of the output are the original matrix, then the same matrix with certain elements changed to 8.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to think of another angle. The number 8 appears frequently, and non-zero numbers are preserved in certain positions. In Example 1's output, the 5s are present in the first and seventh positions of the first row. The input's first row has a 5 in the second position. So maybe each non-zero element is replicated in the output in specific mirrored positions.\n\nAnother idea: The output is created by tiling the input matrix in a 2x2 grid, with each tile being the original matrix. Then, between the tiles, certain elements are replaced with 8. For example, the output has four tiles (original, original, original, original), but with overlapping elements replaced with 8. But this may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the Kronecker product of the input matrix with a certain 2x2 matrix. For example, if the input is multiplied by [[1,8],[8,8]], then each element a in the input becomes a block [[a,8],[8,8]]. Let's test this:\n\nFor input element 2, the block is [[2,8],[8,8]]\n\nFor 0: [[0,8],[8,8]]\n\nSo for Example 0's first row [2,0,0], the Kronecker product would produce:\n\nRow 0: 2,8,0,8,0,8\n\nRow 1:8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nBut the actual output's first two rows are:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nSo this doesn't match. However, the third row in Example 0's output is [8,0,2,8,0,2]. The 2s are at the end, which suggests that perhaps the Kronecker product is not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps each element in the input is replaced by a 2x2 block where the top-left is the original element, top-right is 8, bottom-left is 8, and bottom-right is the original element. So for element 2:\n\n[2,8]\n\n[8,2]\n\nFor element 0:\n\n[0,8]\n\n[8,0]\n\nThen, for Example 0's first row [2,0,0], the blocks would be:\n\n2 8 | 0 8 | 0 8\n\n8 2 | 8 0 | 8 0\n\nSo combining these horizontally:\n\nRow 0: 2,8,0,8,0,8\n\nRow 1:8,2,8,0,8,0\n\nBut the actual output for Example 0's first two rows is:\n\nRow0: [2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\nRow1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nHmm, not matching. But wait, the actual output's row0 has 2,0,8, which suggests that the original element is followed by 0 and 8. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's output, the first row has 2,0,8, then repeats the same pattern. So it's like the original row is [2,0,0] transformed to [2,0,8], then repeated. Similarly, the second row is [8,0,8, ...], which is perhaps transforming the original row [0,0,0] into [8,0,8], but the input's second row is all zeros. Wait, the input's second row is [0,0,0], but in the output, the second row is [8,0,8,8,0,8]. So perhaps rows with all zeros are transformed into rows filled with 8s and 0s.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a general pattern that fits all examples.\n\nLooking at all examples, the output dimensions are double the input's. So each element is mapped to a 2x2 block.\n\nIn Example 2, the input 4 is mapped to a block where the first row is [4,4] and the second row is [8,8].\n\nThe input 0 is mapped to [0,0] and [0,0].\n\nIn Example 0, the input 2 is mapped to blocks where the first row is [2,0,8] and the second row is [8,0,8]. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation for non-zero elements is to place the original value in the top-left and bottom-right of the 2x2 block, and 8 in the other positions. For zeros, the entire block is 8s except for the original 0s. But this may not fit.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. For the first 2x2 block (first two elements):\n\n2,0\n\n8, ?\n\nBut the next elements are 8, then 2,0,8. So this doesn't fit a 2x2 block structure.\n\nMaybe the pattern isn't about expanding each element into a block, but rather about duplicating the rows and columns with modifications.\n\nIn Example 2's input, each row is duplicated. The first duplicate is the original row, then the second duplicate is the original row with non-zero elements replaced by 8. Then this pair is duplicated again. So each input row becomes four output rows. But Example 2's input is 2x2 and output is 4x4, which matches.\n\nFor Example 0's input 3x3, output is 6x6. So each row is duplicated twice. The first duplicate is the original row with elements repeated and 8s added. The second duplicate is modified with 8s. Then this pair is repeated again.\n\nAlternatively, each input row is processed into two output rows: the original row followed by a modified version where non-zeros are replaced with 8, and this is done for each column as well.\n\nBut how to get the columns doubled?\n\nAnother approach: For each element in the input, in the output, it is placed at positions (2i, 2j) and (2i+1, 2j+1), and the other positions are filled with 8. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal element at (0,0) is 2. In output, positions (0,0) and (1,1) would be 2, and surrounding positions filled with 8.\n\nBut the output's first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. If (0,0) is 2, then (0,1) would be 0, which is from the input. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, each element is placed at (2i, 2j) and (2i, 2j+1) as the same value, and the next row is filled with 8s. For Example 0's first row [2,0,0], output row0 would be 2,2,0,0,0,0, and row1 would be 8,8,8,8,8,8. But this doesn't match the actual output.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another pattern. Looking at the output for Example 1, the input has 5s in certain positions. The output for those positions has 5s in mirrored positions. For example, the input's first row has a 5 at column 1. In the output's first row, the 5 is at positions 1 and 7 (assuming 0-based), which are mirrored around the center.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first row has 2s at positions 0 and 3. The input's first row has a 2 at position 0, so perhaps each element is mirrored with 8s in between. The output row length is double the input's. So for an input row of length 3, the output row is length 6. The pattern could be: original elements followed by 8s, then original elements again. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by interleaving the original elements with 8s. For example, for each element in the input row, insert an 8 after it. Then repeat the row. So for [2,0,0], it becomes [2,8,0,8,0,8], then repeated as is. But the output's first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: The output rows are formed by concatenating the input row with a modified version of itself. For non-zero elements, they are replaced with 8. For example, the first output row for Example 0's first input row [2,0,0] would be [2,0,0] concatenated with [8,0,8], resulting in [2,0,0,8,0,8]. But the actual output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the modified version is the original row with non-zeros replaced by 8. So [2,0,0] becomes [8,0,0]. Then concatenated with the original row: [2,0,0,8,0,0]. Still not matching.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the pattern is that each element is mirrored with 8s inserted in between. For example, each row is followed by the same row with non-zero elements replaced by 8, and columns are doubled similarly. So each row is expanded into two rows: the original and the modified (non-zero to 8), and each column is expanded by duplicating, inserting 8s.\n\nBut this needs to be checked.\n\nFor Example 2's input row [0,4]:\n\nFirst output row is [0,4,0,4] (original elements duplicated).\n\nSecond output row is [0,8,0,8] (non-zero elements replaced with 8, duplicated).\n\nThen this pair is repeated. Which matches Example 2's output.\n\nFor Example 0's input row [2,0,0]:\n\nFirst output row would be [2,0,0,2,0,0] (original duplicated).\n\nSecond output row would be [8,0,0,8,0,0] (non-zero replaced with 8).\n\nBut the actual output for Example 0's first two rows is:\n\n[2,0,8,2,0,8]\n\n[8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nHmm, not matching. So perhaps instead of duplicating the row, each element is replaced with two elements: the original and 8 if non-zero, or 0 and 8 if zero. Then the row is followed by another row where non-zero elements are replaced with 8.\n\nSo for [2,0,0], each element becomes two elements:\n\n2 becomes [2,8]\n\n0 becomes [0,8]\n\n0 becomes [0,8]\n\nSo the first row is [2,8,0,8,0,8].\n\nThen the second row is [8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nBut the actual output's first two rows are [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8]. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation for each element in the row is to create two elements: the original and then 8 if non-zero, else 0. So for 2: [2,8], 0: [0,0]. So [2,0,0] becomes [2,8,0,0,0,0]. Then the row is followed by the same, but with non-zero elements replaced by 8. So second row would be [8,8,0,0,0,0]. But again, doesn't match.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for another pattern. Let's consider that the output is formed by replicating the input matrix twice in both directions (rows and columns) and then replacing certain elements with 8. For example, the input matrix is placed in the top-left and bottom-right quadrants, and the other quadrants are filled with 8s. But in Example 0's input is 3x3, output 6x6. So quadrants would be 3x3. Let's see:\n\nTop-left quadrant: original matrix.\n\nTop-right: filled with 8s.\n\nBottom-left: filled with 8s.\n\nBottom-right: original matrix.\n\nBut Example 0's output has 2s in the bottom-right. For instance, the last row is [8,0,2,8,0,2]. The bottom-right quadrant would be [0,0,2], [0,0,0], [0,0,2], but in the output, it's mirrored. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the matrix is mirrored both horizontally and vertically, with 8s in the overlapping parts. This might explain the symmetry in the output.\n\nAnother idea: The output is generated by taking each element and placing it in a checkerboard pattern with 8s. For example, each element is placed at even-even indices, and 8s are placed at even-odd, odd-even, and odd-odd indices. But this doesn't explain the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the input has a 5 in row 0 column 1. The output's first row has 5 in position 1 and 7 (assuming 0-based), which are columns 1 and 7. The input row has length 6, output row 12. So each element is placed at columns 2j and 2j+1. For example, input element 5 at column 1 would be at columns 2 and 3. But in the output, it's at columns 1 and 7, which doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to summarize the patterns observed:\n\n- The output dimensions are double the input's.\n\n- Non-zero elements in the input are preserved in certain positions in the output, but also replaced with 8s in other positions.\n\n- The output often has a symmetrical or mirrored structure.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first and fourth rows are the same. The second and fifth rows are the same. The third and sixth rows are the same. So it's like the output is the input matrix stacked vertically twice, with each row transformed.\n\nSimilarly, columns seem to be doubled. For example, in Example 0's output, each element appears twice in a row, separated by 8s.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is:\n\nEach row in the input is transformed into two rows in the output. The first transformed row consists of each element from the original row followed by 8 if the element is non-zero, else 0. The second transformed row consists of 8 followed by the original element if non-zero, else 0. Then, each pair of rows is duplicated.\n\nWait, let's test this for Example 2's input row [0,4]:\n\nFirst transformed row: [0,0,4,8] \u2192 but Example 2's output row is [0,4,0,4]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, each element is replaced with a pair: for non-zero, [element, 8], for zero [0, 0]. Then the row is duplicated.\n\nFor Example 2's input row [0,4]:\n\nTransformed row would be [0,0,4,8]. Then duplicate this row, but the output rows are [0,4,0,4], etc. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each element is replaced with [element, 8] if non-zero, else [0,8]. Then each row is duplicated with the second row having non-zero elements replaced by 8.\n\nFor Example 0's input row [2,0,0]:\n\nTransformed row 1: [2,8,0,8,0,8]\n\nRow 2: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nBut the actual output rows are different.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for the pattern that the output matrix is a combination of the original matrix and a modified version where non-zero elements are replaced with 8, both horizontally and vertically concatenated. For example, each row is concatenated with its modified version (non-zero to 8) to double the columns, and each such row is duplicated with the same or another modified version to double the rows.\n\nLet's test this for Example 2:\n\nInput row [0,4]. Modified version (non-zero to 8) would be [0,8].\n\nSo each row becomes [0,4,0,8] when concatenated horizontally. Then, each such row is duplicated vertically. But the output rows are [0,4,0,4], which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each row is duplicated horizontally and modified. For Example 2's row [0,4], the output rows are [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8], each duplicated twice. This matches Example 2's output.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- Create a new row by duplicating each element, resulting in a row twice as long. For example, [0,4] becomes [0,0,4,4].\n\n- Create another new row by replacing non-zero elements with 8 and duplicating, so [0,4] becomes [0,0,8,8].\n\n- Then, these two new rows are repeated again.\n\nSo for Example 2's input:\n\nRow 0 of input is [0,4]. Processed into two rows:\n\nRow A: [0,0,4,4]\n\nRow B: [0,0,8,8]\n\nThen these are repeated, resulting in four rows: A, B, A, B.\n\nWhich matches Example 2's output.\n\nLet's apply this to Example 0's first input row [2,0,0]:\n\nRow A: [2,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow B: [8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output rows are [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8], which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the duplication is different. For each element in the input row, create two elements: the original and 8 if non-zero, else 0 and 0. Then, create another row where non-zero elements are replaced with 8 and duplicated.\n\nFor input row [2,0,0]:\n\nRow A: [2,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow B: [8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut Example 0's first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which is different.\n\nAnother possible pattern: Each row in the input is duplicated twice in the output. The first duplication is the original row followed by the same row with non-zero elements replaced by 8. The second duplication is the same as the first.\n\nBut for Example 0's row [2,0,0], this would give:\n\nOriginal row: [2,0,0]\n\nModified row: [8,0,0]\n\nThen duplicated:\n\n[2,0,0,8,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match.\n\nAt this point, I think the correct pattern is to expand each element into a 2x2 block where:\n\n- If the element is non-zero, the block is [element, 8; 8, element].\n\n- If the element is zero, the block is [0, 0; 0, 0].\n\nBut let's test this.\n\nFor Example 2's input row [0,4]:\n\nFor 0: [0,0;0,0]\n\nFor 4: [4,8;8,4]\n\nSo combining blocks horizontally:\n\nRow 0: 0,0,4,8\n\nRow 1:0,0,8,4\n\nThen the output would have rows:\n\n[0,0,4,8]\n\n[0,0,8,4]\n\nBut Example 2's output first two rows are [0,4,0,4] and [0,8,0,8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: After trying various methods and not finding the exact pattern, I'll look for common elements in the outputs:\n\n- The number 8 is used as a filler.\n\n- Non-zero elements are preserved in certain positions.\n\n- The output is double the size in both dimensions.\n\n- Rows and columns seem to have mirrored patterns.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first row is [2,0,8,2,0,8]. It looks like the original row [2,0,0] is mirrored, with 8s inserted in between. So 2,0,0 becomes 2,0,8, 2,0,8. Similarly, the second row is [8,0,8,8,0,8], which is perhaps the mirrored version of the original row filled with 8s.\n\nMaybe the pattern is to mirror each row and insert 8s in the middle. For example, each row is followed by its reverse with 8s inserted.\n\nFor a row of length N, the mirrored row would have length 2N. For example, [2,0,0] becomes [2,0,0,8,0,0,2] but this doesn't fit the output.\n\nAlternatively, the row is mirrored and 8 is inserted between the original and mirrored parts. For [2,0,0], mirrored is [0,0,2], so combining with 8 in between: [2,0,0,8,0,0,2]. But the output row is length 6, so maybe [2,0,0,8,0,0], but Example 0's first output row is [2,0,8,2,0,8], which doesn't match.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the difficulty, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the pattern for non-zero elements (like 4) is that in the duplicated rows, the 4 becomes 8. So perhaps the rule is:\n\n- Each input row is duplicated into two output rows.\n\n- The first row is the original elements duplicated (each element appears twice).\n\n- The second row is the original elements replaced with 8 if non-zero, otherwise 0, and duplicated.\n\nThen, these two rows are repeated again for the vertical expansion.\n\nApplying this to Example 2's input row [0,4]:\n\nFirst output row: [0,0,4,4] (original duplicated)\n\nSecond output row: [0,0,8,8] (non-zero replaced with 8)\n\nThen these two rows are repeated again, leading to four rows:\n\n[0,0,4,4]\n\n[0,0,8,8]\n\n[0,0,4,4]\n\n[0,0,8,8]\n\nBut the actual output is:\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n\n[0,8,0,8]\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n\n[0,8,0,8]\n\nHmm, this doesn't match. But in the actual output, the elements are spaced out. Maybe the duplication is not adjacent but with zeros in between.\n\nAlternatively, each element is transformed into two elements: the original and 8 if non-zero, else 0 and 8. Then the row is duplicated vertically with non-zero elements replaced by 8.\n\nFor Example 0's input row [2,0,0]:\n\nTransformed row: [2,8,0,8,0,8]\n\nThen duplicate this row, replacing non-zero elements with 8: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nBut Example 0's first two rows are [2,0,8,2,0,8] and [8,0,8,8,0,8], which doesn't fit.\n\nFinally, considering all examples and the time I have, I think the pattern is:\n\nEach input element is replaced by two elements: the original and 8 if non-zero, else 0 and 8. Then, each row is duplicated, replacing non-zero elements with 8 in the duplicated row.\n\nLet's test this for Example 2:\n\nInput row [0,4]:\n\nEach element is transformed into two elements:\n\n0 \u2192 0,8\n\n4 \u21924,8\n\nSo transformed row: [0,8,4,8]\n\nThen duplicated row with non-zero replaced by 8: [0,8,8,8]\n\nSo output rows for this input row would be:\n\n[0,8,4,8]\n\n[0,8,8,8]\n\nRepeated again.\n\nBut Example 2's output is:\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n\n[0,8,0,8]\n\n[0,4,0,4]\n\n[0,8,0,8]\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nAfter struggling, I'll look for a pattern in the test input. The test input is a 4x4 matrix:\n\n[0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n[3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nApplying the pattern from the examples, the output should be an 8x8 matrix. \n\nAssuming that each row is transformed into two rows: the original elements duplicated with 8s inserted, and then a modified row with non-zero elements replaced by 8. For example:\n\nFirst input row [0,0,3,0] becomes:\n\n[0,0,3,8,0,0,3,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the non-zero elements are kept in certain positions. Another way: each row is duplicated, with non-zero elements replaced by 8 in the duplicated rows, and the columns are expanded similarly. \n\nAlternatively, the output for the test input would have each 3 replaced with a pattern involving 3 and 8 in specific positions.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed to write the output based on the examples, assuming that each element is replaced by two elements: the original and 8 if non-zero, else 0 and 8, and each row is duplicated with non-zero elements replaced by 8.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 3, 0]\n\nTransformed to two elements per input element:\n\n0 \u2192 0,8\n\n0 \u2192 0,8\n\n3 \u21923,8\n\n0 \u21920,8\n\nSo row 0 becomes [0,8,0,8,3,8,0,8]\n\nThen duplicated row with non-zero replaced by 8:\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nBut looking at Example 1's output, this isn't the case. Alternatively, the duplicated row has non-zero elements replaced by 8, and zeros remain. For row 0, the second row would be [8,8,8,8,3\u21928,8,8,8], resulting in [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nBut this doesn't fit the examples. Given that this is taking too long and the competition setting, I'll proceed to provide an answer based on the observed patterns in the examples, particularly the symmetry and the use of 8s.",
