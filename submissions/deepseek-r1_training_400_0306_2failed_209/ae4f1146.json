        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to take a 9x9 grid of numbers and output a 3x3 grid. The numbers involved are 0, 1, and 8. Let me look at the training examples to see if I can spot the transformation.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 9x9 grid. The output is three rows of three elements each. Let me look at the input and output.\n\nIn Example 0's input, each row is a list of 9 numbers. The output is three rows of three. Hmm. Maybe the 9x9 is divided into 3x3 blocks, and each block is processed into one element of the output? Let's check.\n\nWait, but the output is 3x3, which would correspond to 9 elements. If the input is 9x9, maybe each 3x3 section of the input is transformed into a single row of the output. Let me think. For example, the input in Example 0 has 9 rows. The output has 3 rows. So perhaps the input is divided into three groups of three rows each, and each group contributes to one row of the output.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 0: the first output row is [8,1,8]. Let's see the first three input rows:\n\nRow 0: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 1: [1,8,8,0,8,1,8,0,0]\nRow 2: [8,8,8,0,1,1,8,0,0]\n\nIf I look at the first three columns of these three rows, maybe that's where the numbers come from. But the output is three elements per row, so maybe each group of three columns? Or maybe each 3x3 block in the input contributes to a single element in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking the center elements of each 3x3 block in the input. Let's see. The input is 9x9, which can be divided into 3x3 blocks of 3x3 each. For example, the first 3 rows and 3 columns form a block, then next 3 columns, etc. So there would be 9 such blocks (3 rows \u00d7 3 columns of blocks). But the output is 3x3. So each block's center or some aggregation could be the output.\n\nWait, the output has three rows each with three elements, which would correspond to the 3x3 blocks in the input. Let's check Example 0's input.\n\nTake the first three rows and first three columns of each to form a block. Let's see:\n\nFirst block (top-left 3x3):\n\nRow 0: 8,8,8\nRow 1: 1,8,8\nRow 2: 8,8,8\n\nIf we take the center of this block (position [1][1] in the block), which is 8. But the first output row's first element is 8, which matches. Then maybe the next block in the first three rows is columns 3-5. Wait, but the output for Example 0's first row is [8,1,8]. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is formed by taking the middle element of each third row group. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first output row is [8,1,8]. Let's see the middle row of the first three input rows (row 1). The middle elements of row 1's three sections? Row 1 is [1,8,8,0,8,1,8,0,0]. Divided into thirds: [1,8,8], [0,8,1], [8,0,0]. The middle elements of each third would be 8, 8, 0. But the output's first element is 8. Hmm, maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each of the three sections (rows 0-2, 3-5, 6-8), we look at their 3x3 grid and take some pattern. Wait, the input is 9x9. If we split it into 3x3 grids, there are 9 such grids (3 rows of 3 grids each). But the output is 3x3. So maybe each output cell corresponds to a 3x3 grid in the input. For example, output[0][0] corresponds to the top-left 3x3 grid of the input, output[0][1] to the middle-top, etc. Then, for each input 3x3 grid, we determine the output value.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nOutput is:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[1,8,1]\n\n[1,8,1]\n\nSo the output is three rows. Let's see the first input 3x3 grid (rows 0-2, columns 0-2):\n\nRow 0: 8,8,8\n\nRow 1: 1,8,8\n\nRow 2: 8,8,8\n\nWhat is the pattern here that gives output 8? Maybe the majority element? All are 8 except row1, column0 which is 1. Majority is 8. So output is 8.\n\nNext input grid: rows 0-2, columns 3-5:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0\n\nRow1: 0,8,1\n\nRow2:0,1,1\n\nHere, the numbers are mostly 0s and some 8 and 1. The majority is 0, but the output is 1. So that doesn't fit. Maybe it's the center of the 3x3 grid. For the first grid, center is 8. Second grid's center is 8 (row1, column4 which is 8). Third grid (columns 6-8) in rows0-2: row0 has 0,0,0; row1:8,0,0; row2:8,0,0. The center would be row1, column7 (0). But the output's first row's third element is 8. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the center element of each 3x3 block in the input. Let's check:\n\nFor the first output element (8), the center of the first input 3x3 block (rows0-2, cols0-2) is at row1, col1: which is 8. That matches.\n\nSecond output element in the first row is 1. Let's see the next 3x3 block (cols3-5, rows0-2). The center is row1, col4 (which is 8). But output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach.\n\nLooking at the output rows in Example 0:\n\nEach output row has three elements. The input has 9 rows, so maybe each output row corresponds to three input rows. For example, the first output row corresponds to rows 0-2, the second to 3-5, third to 6-8. Then, for each group of three input rows, how are the three output elements generated?\n\nLooking at Example 0's first output row [8,1,8]. Let's take input rows 0-2. How do these three rows produce those three elements?\n\nLooking at each row in the input group:\n\nRow0: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [1,8,8,0,8,1,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [8,8,8,0,1,1,8,0,0]\n\nMaybe for each of the three output elements in the row, we take the middle element of each third of the input rows. For example, split each row into three parts (columns 0-2, 3-5, 6-8), then take the middle element of each part.\n\nFor row0: parts are [8,8,8], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]. Middle elements are 8,0,0.\n\nRow1: [1,8,8], [0,8,1], [8,0,0]. Middle elements 8,8,0.\n\nRow2: [8,8,8], [0,1,1], [8,0,0]. Middle elements 8,1,0.\n\nNow, maybe combine these three rows' middle elements. For each column part (first, second, third), take the majority or some other rule.\n\nFirst column part's middle elements across the three rows: 8 (row0), 8 (row1), 8 (row2) \u2192 all 8s. So output first element is 8.\n\nSecond column part's middle elements: 0 (row0), 8 (row1),1 (row2). The majority here would be 0, 8,1. Maybe sum them? Or take the mode. The values are 0,8,1. No majority. But output is 1. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe check if there's a sequence here. 0,8,1. Maybe the middle value when sorted? 0,1,8 \u2192 median is 1. So output is 1. That matches the first output's second element.\n\nThird column part's middle elements: 0 (row0), 0 (row1),0 (row2). So all 0s, but the output is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe this approach isn't right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each output row, we look at the middle row of the three input rows. For example, the first output row comes from the middle row of the first three input rows (row1). Then, take the middle element of each third of that row.\n\nRow1: [1,8,8,0,8,1,8,0,0]. Divided into thirds: [1,8,8], [0,8,1], [8,0,0]. The middle elements are 8,8,0. But the output is [8,1,8], which doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: the output might be based on the presence of a certain pattern in each 3x3 block. For example, looking for a cross pattern of 8s or 1s. But how?\n\nLooking at Example0's first output row [8,1,8]. Let's check the corresponding 3x3 blocks:\n\nFirst block (top-left 3x3):\n\nRows 0-2, columns 0-2.\n\nThe elements are:\n\n8 8 8\n\n1 8 8\n\n8 8 8\n\nThis looks like a cross? The center is 8, and the surrounding are 8s except for the first element of row1. Maybe the pattern is that the center is 8, and there are certain numbers around. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 3x3 block in the input is transformed by some rule. For example, count the number of 1s and 8s. If 8s are more, output 8. If 1s are more, output 1. Otherwise, maybe something else.\n\nFirst block (rows0-2, cols0-2):\n\nNumber of 8s: 8 (since row0 has 3, row1 has 2, row2 has 3 \u2192 3+2+3=8? Wait row0: 8,8,8 \u2192 3. row1:1,8,8 \u2192 2. row2:8,8,8 \u2192 3. Total 3+2+3=8. Number of 1s: 1. So output 8.\n\nSecond block (rows0-2, cols3-5):\n\nRow0: 0,0,0 \u2192 all 0s. row1:0,8,1 \u2192 8 and 1. row2:0,1,1 \u2192 two 1s. So 8:1, 1:3. So majority is 1. Output is 1. Which matches the second element of the first output row.\n\nThird block (rows0-2, cols6-8):\n\nRow0: 0,0,0. row1:8,0,0. row2:8,0,0.\n\nNumber of 8s: 2. 1s:0. 0s:7. So majority is 0, but output is 8. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nBut in the output, the third element of the first row is 8, but according to this count, there's only 2 8s. So maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the center of each 3x3 block. For the first block, center is 8. Second block's center is 8 (row1, col4). Third block's center is row1, col7 (which is 0). But output's third element is 8, which doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the elements along the middle row and middle column of the entire 9x9 grid. For example, the middle row is row4, and the middle column is column4. But the output is 3x3, so maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs. The outputs are all combinations of 8 and 1. For example, in Example 0, the output rows are [8,1,8], [1,8,1], [1,8,1]. So each row has alternating 8 and 1. Maybe it's a checkerboard pattern. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated based on the positions where 8 and 1 are adjacent in the input. But that's vague.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the middle 3x3 of the input. Because the input is 9x9, the center 3x3 would be rows 3-5 and columns 3-5. Let's check Example 0's input.\n\nExample0's input rows 3-5:\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,8,8,8,0,0,8,1,8]\n\nThe columns 3-5 for these rows would be:\n\nRow3: 0,8,8\n\nRow4:1,0,0\n\nRow5:8,0,0\n\nSo the center 3x3 of the input would be:\n\n[0,8,8]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0]\n\nBut the output of Example0 is different. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. Let's check another example. Example1's input:\n\nFirst three rows:\n\nRow0: [0,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,8,1,8,0,8,1,8,0]\n\nRow2: [0,8,8,8,0,1,8,8,0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[1,1,8]\n\n[8,8,1]\n\nSo perhaps the first output row is derived from the first three rows of the input. Let's see.\n\nIf the first output row is [8,1,8], maybe each element is the center of a 3x3 grid in the first three rows.\n\nFor the first element (8), maybe the first 3x3 block (rows0-2, cols0-2):\n\nRow0:0,8,8\n\nRow1:0,8,1\n\nRow2:0,8,8\n\nThe center of this block is 8 (row1, col1). So 8. That matches the first output.\n\nSecond element (1): next 3x3 block (cols3-5, rows0-2):\n\nRow0:1,0,0\n\nRow1:8,0,8\n\nRow2:8,0,1\n\nThe center is row1, col4 (0). But the output is 1. Doesn't match.\n\nThird element (8): cols6-8, rows0-2:\n\nRow0:0,0,0\n\nRow1:1,8,0\n\nRow2:8,8,0\n\nCenter is row1, col7 (8). So that's 8. Which matches the third output element.\n\nSo the first output row's elements are 8, center of first block (8), center of second block (0), center of third block (8). But output has 1 as the second element. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output elements are determined by the majority in each 3x3 block. Let's check the second block (cols3-5, rows0-2):\n\nElements are 1,0,0 (row0), 8,0,8 (row1), 8,0,1 (row2). So total numbers: 1 appears once, 0 appears five times (row0 has two 0s, row1 has one 0, row2 has one 0?), wait row0 cols3-5:1,0,0 (so 0s: two), row1 cols3-5:8,0,8 (one 0), row2:8,0,1 (one 0). So total 0s: 2+1+1=4. 8s: row1 has two, row2 has one \u2192 three. 1s: one. So majority is 0, but output is 1. Hmm. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number that forms a cross in the 3x3 block. For example, if the center is 8 and the four corners are 8, then output 8. But not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output, each row in the output seems to alternate between 8 and 1. Like [8,1,8], then [1,8,1], then [1,8,1]. This might suggest a pattern where each output row alternates between 8 and 1, but that might be specific to that example. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1's output:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[1,1,8]\n\n[8,8,1]\n\nNot a strict alternation. So that's probably not a general rule.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for how the output elements correspond to certain positions in the input.\n\nAnother observation: the outputs for each example are 3x3 grids, which is the same size as the central part of the input (since the input is 9x9). But that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by looking at the 3x3 grid that's the intersection of rows 3-5 and columns 3-5. Let me check for Example0.\n\nRows3-5, cols3-5:\n\nRow3: 0,8,8 (cols3-5 are indexes 3,4,5 which are 0,8,8?)\n\nWait, row3 is [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0]. So cols3-5 are 0,8,8.\n\nRow4: [0,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 cols3-5:1,0,0.\n\nRow5: [0,8,8,8,0,0,8,1,8] \u2192 cols3-5:8,0,0.\n\nSo the 3x3 grid here is:\n\n[0,8,8]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0]\n\nBut the output of Example0 is:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[1,8,1]\n\n[1,8,1]\n\nThis doesn't match. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Maybe the output is derived from the number of 8-1 transitions or some other adjacency count in each 3x3 region. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example0's first output row [8,1,8], perhaps each element corresponds to a different region in the input. Let's think: maybe the first element is the top-left 3x3 of the input, the second is the top-middle, third top-right. Then for each of those regions, what's the rule to get the output?\n\nFirst region (top-left 3x3):\n\n8 8 8\n\n1 8 8\n\n8 8 8\n\nWhat's special here? The center is 8, and it's surrounded by 8s except for a 1 in the top-left of the middle row. Output is 8.\n\nSecond region (top-middle 3x3):\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 8 1\n\n0 1 1\n\nThe center is 8. Output is 1.\n\nThird region (top-right 3x3):\n\n0 0 0\n\n8 0 0\n\n8 0 0\n\nCenter is 0. Output is 8.\n\nSo in this case, the output elements are 8,1,8. But how do these relate to the centers? Only the first matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the presence of certain patterns. For example, in the first region, if there's a 8 in the center and 1s around, then output 8. But not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output elements are the value of the cell in the input's corresponding 3x3 block that is at the same position as the output's cell. For example, output[0][0] is the center of the input's top-left 3x3 block. output[0][1] is the center of the top-middle 3x3 block, etc.\n\nSo for Example0's first output row [8,1,8]:\n\noutput[0][0] is center of top-left block (row1, col1: 8).\n\noutput[0][1] is center of top-middle block (row1, col4: 8, but output is 1. So that's not right.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the output's cell is the value of the cell in the input's 3x3 block that is mirrored. For example, the output cell [i][j] is the cell [2-j][2-i] of the input's 3x3 block. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the third row of each 3x3 block. For example, the first output row takes the third row of each top row block.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here. Let's try looking for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [8,8,8,0,0,0,8,1,8]\n\nRow1: [8,8,8,0,0,0,1,8,1]\n\nRow2: [1,8,8,0,0,0,8,1,8]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,8,1,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,8,8,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,1,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,8]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,1]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,8]\n\nThe output should be a 3x3 grid. Following the examples, perhaps each group of three rows contributes to one output row. For example, rows0-2, 3-5, 6-8.\n\nLet's focus on the first output row. Let's see what the first three rows of the test input look like:\n\nRows0-2:\n\nRow0:8,8,8,0,0,0,8,1,8\n\nRow1:8,8,8,0,0,0,1,8,1\n\nRow2:1,8,8,0,0,0,8,1,8\n\nNow, perhaps for each of the three sections in these rows (columns 0-2, 3-5, 6-8), we process them to get the output elements.\n\nLooking at columns 0-2 for rows0-2:\n\nRow0:8,8,8\n\nRow1:8,8,8\n\nRow2:1,8,8\n\nWhat's the pattern here? The majority is 8. So output first element could be 8.\n\nColumns 3-5 for rows0-2 are all 0s. So if majority is 0, but in the training examples, when columns 3-5 had 0s, the output element was 1 in Example0. So perhaps it's not majority.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the center element of each 3x3 block. For columns0-2, rows0-2:\n\nThe center is row1, col1: 8. So output is 8.\n\nFor columns3-5, rows0-2: all 0s. Center is row1, col4: 0. So output would be 0, but in Example0's first output row, the middle element was 1 when the center was 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the presence of 1s in certain positions. For example, if there's a 1 in the block, output 1. Otherwise, 8. But in the first block (columns0-2, rows0-2), there's a 1 in row2, col0. So maybe output is 1. But according to Example0's first block, which had a 1 in row1, col0, the output was 8. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the output rows in the examples, each row is three elements. Maybe each element corresponds to a triplet of rows and columns. For example, the first element is from rows0-2 and columns0-2, the second element from rows0-2 and columns3-5, the third from rows0-2 and columns6-8. Similarly for the next two rows of the output.\n\nBut how do we get the value for each triplet?\n\nIn Example0's first triplet (rows0-2, cols0-2):\n\nThe elements are mostly 8s except for one 1. The output is 8.\n\nSecond triplet (cols3-5, rows0-2): three 0s, an 8, and some 1s. Output is 1.\n\nThird triplet (cols6-8, rows0-2): mostly 0s and two 8s. Output is 8.\n\nSo perhaps if there's at least one 1 in the triplet, the output is 1. Otherwise, 8. But in the second triplet, there is one 1 and one 8, but output is 1. In the third triplet, there are two 8s but no 1s (row0: all 0s, row1:8,0,0, row2:8,0,0). So output is 8. That fits. So the rule could be: for each 3x3 block (rows and columns grouped into 3x3 sections), if there's at least one 1 in the block, output 1, else output 8. But wait, in Example0's second block (cols3-5, rows0-2):\n\nRow0:0,0,0\n\nRow1:0,8,1\n\nRow2:0,1,1\n\nThere are 1s here, so output is 1. That fits. Third block (cols6-8, rows0-2):\n\nRow0:0,0,0\n\nRow1:8,0,0\n\nRow2:8,0,0\n\nNo 1s, so output 8. Correct. First block has 1, so why output is 8? Because there is a 1. Wait, according to this rule, if there's a 1, output would be 1, but in the first block of Example0, output is 8. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. So that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternative rule: output is 1 if there are more 1s than 8s in the block, else 8. But in the first block of Example0, there's 1 one and 8 eights. So output would be 8. Which matches. Second block has 3 ones and 1 eight, so output 1. Third block has 0 ones and 2 eights, so output 8. That fits Example0's first row.\n\nLet's test this rule on another example. Example1's first output row is [8,1,8].\n\nFirst block (cols0-2, rows0-2):\n\nRow0:0,8,8\n\nRow1:0,8,1\n\nRow2:0,8,8\n\nNumber of 1s: 1. 8s: 7. So output 8. Correct.\n\nSecond block (cols3-5, rows0-2):\n\nRow0:1,0,0 \u2192 1 one.\n\nRow1:8,0,8 \u2192 0 ones.\n\nRow2:8,0,1 \u2192 1 one.\n\nTotal 2 ones. 8s: 2 (row1 has two 8s). So 2 ones vs 2 eights. So tied. What's the output? Example1's first row's second element is 1. So the rule may have a tiebreaker. Maybe if tie, output 1. But in this case, the output is 1. So perhaps if the count of 1s is equal to or greater than 8s, output 1, else 8.\n\nIn this case, 2 ones vs 2 eights \u2192 output 1. Which matches.\n\nThird block (cols6-8, rows0-2):\n\nRow0:0,0,0 \u2192 0 ones.\n\nRow1:1,8,0 \u2192 1 one.\n\nRow2:8,8,0 \u2192 0 ones.\n\nTotal 1 one. 8s: 2. So output 8. Which matches the third element of the first row (8).\n\nThis seems to fit. Let's check another example. Example3's first output row is [8,1,1].\n\nFirst block (cols0-2, rows0-2):\n\nRow0:0,0,1\n\nRow1:0,0,8\n\nRow2:0,0,1\n\nCount of 1s: 2. 8s:1. So output 1. But output is 8. Hmm, this contradicts.\n\nWait, Example3's input:\n\nExample3's input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,1,1,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,8,8,1,0,8,1,1]\n\nRow2: [0,0,1,1,8,0,1,1,1]\n\nFirst block (cols0-2, rows0-2):\n\nRow0:0,0,1 \u2192 1 one.\n\nRow1:0,0,8 \u2192 0 ones.\n\nRow2:0,0,1 \u2192 1 one.\n\nTotal 2 ones. 8s:1. So according to the rule, output 1. But Example3's first output row is [8,1,1]. So first element is 8, which contradicts.\n\nSo this rule doesn't hold. So maybe the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the output rows, perhaps each output row is the middle row of each group of three input rows, and each output element is the middle element of each third of that row.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nOutput row 0: [8,1,8]\n\nThe middle row of the first three input rows is row1: [1,8,8,0,8,1,8,0,0]. Split into thirds: [1,8,8], [0,8,1], [8,0,0]. Middle elements of each third are 8,8,0. But output is [8,1,8]. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut maybe it's not the middle row of the group, but a different row. For example, maybe the first output row takes the first row of the input group, the second output row takes the second input group's first row, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are determined by looking at the diagonal of the input's 3x3 blocks. For example, the first output row's elements are the top-left, center, and bottom-right of the corresponding 3x3 blocks.\n\nBut this is just guessing without a clear pattern.\n\nAnother idea: the output could be based on the presence of certain sequences in the input. For example, looking for runs of three 8s or 1s in a row or column.\n\nIn Example0's first three rows, row0 has three 8s followed by six 0s. Maybe this contributes to the first output element being 8.\n\nBut row1 has 1,8,8, etc., and the output's first row's second element is 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s in the first column of each group of three. For example, in the first three rows of Example0's input, first column is 8,1,8. So two 8s and one 1. Majority is 8, so output 8. But this is per column, but the output is per element.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for a pattern that works across all examples.\n\nAnother observation: The output in each example is a 3x3 grid where each row has a mix of 8 and 1. The number of 8s and 1s varies. For example, Example0 has two 8s and one 1 in the first row, then one 8 and two 1s in the second row, etc. \n\nLet's think about the test input. Let's apply the previous hypothesis of counting 1s and 8s in each 3x3 block and see if it fits.\n\nTest input's first three rows:\n\nRow0:8,8,8,0,0,0,8,1,8\n\nRow1:8,8,8,0,0,0,1,8,1\n\nRow2:1,8,8,0,0,0,8,1,8\n\nFirst block (cols0-2, rows0-2):\n\nRow0:8,8,8 \u2192 three 8s.\n\nRow1:8,8,8 \u2192 three 8s.\n\nRow2:1,8,8 \u2192 two 8s and one 1.\n\nTotal 8s: 3+3+2=8. 1s:1. So output 8.\n\nSecond block (cols3-5, rows0-2):\n\nRow0:0,0,0 \u2192 three 0s.\n\nRow1:0,0,0 \u2192 three 0s.\n\nRow2:0,0,0 \u2192 three 0s.\n\nNo 1s or 8s. So according to previous rule, output would be 8 (since no 1s). But in Example0's second block, which had some 1s and 8s, the output was 1. So if all are 0s, maybe output is 0. But the outputs in the examples don't have any 0s. So maybe in such a case, output 8. So first output row's second element would be 8. But looking at the training examples, when a block has all 0s, what's the output? For example, Example0's third block in the first group (cols6-8) had two 8s and the rest 0s. Output was 8. So maybe all-zero blocks output 8.\n\nThird block (cols6-8, rows0-2):\n\nRow0:8,1,8 \u2192 two 8s and one 1.\n\nRow1:1,8,1 \u2192 one 8 and two 1s.\n\nRow2:8,1,8 \u2192 two 8s and one 1.\n\nCount of 8s: 2+1+2=5. 1s:1+2+1=4. So output 8.\n\nSo first output row would be [8,8,8]. But looking at the training examples, the outputs have a mix of 8 and 1. So this might not be correct.\n\nBut in the test input's first three rows, the second block (cols3-5) is all zeros, which might be a special case. Perhaps the rule for all-zero blocks is different. Maybe if a block has all zeros, output 1? But in Example0's first block's third section (cols6-8) had mostly zeros and two 8s. Output was 8. So all-zero block would have 0s, but output is 8. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived from the non-zero elements in the block. If all are zero, output 0. But in the examples, outputs never have 0s. So that can't be.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's think of another angle.\n\nLooking at the test input, the middle rows (3-5) and middle columns (3-5) have the numbers 8,1,8 in row3, 8,8,1 in row4, 1,8,8 in row5. So maybe the middle of the input's middle section forms the output. But the output is 3x3, so perhaps:\n\nThe output is the transpose of the middle 3x3 of the input. But let's check.\n\nTest input's middle rows (3-5) and middle columns (3-5):\n\nRow3: cols3-5 are 8,1,8.\n\nRow4: cols3-5 are 8,8,1.\n\nRow5: cols3-5 are 1,8,8.\n\nSo the middle 3x3 is:\n\n8 1 8\n\n8 8 1\n\n1 8 8\n\nIf this were the output, it would be:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[8,8,1]\n\n[1,8,8]\n\nBut looking at the examples, the outputs are different. For example, Example0's output doesn't match this. So this is probably not the case.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by looking at the positions where 8 and 1 alternate in some way. For example, each row in the output is the middle row of the corresponding input group, but with some transformation. For instance, taking the first, fifth, and ninth elements of each row. But in Example0's first input row, the first three elements are 8,8,8. Taking first, fifth, ninth elements would be 8,0,0. Not matching output.\n\nAlternatively, for each group of three rows, take the diagonal elements. For example, in rows0-2, the diagonal elements (row0col0, row1col1, row2col2) would be 8,8,8 \u2192 output 8. But Example0's first output element is 8, which matches. Second element would be row0col3, row1col4, row2col5 \u2192 0,8,1 \u2192 8. But output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of Example0, the first row is [8,1,8], which is the same as the third row of Example3's output. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the result of a convolution operation, where each output cell is determined by applying a kernel to the corresponding input region. For example, a kernel that detects certain patterns.\n\nFor instance, if the 3x3 block in the input has a certain number of 8s and 1s, the output is determined by some rule. For example:\n\nIf the block contains exactly three 8s and one 1, output 8.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be generated by a XOR-like pattern between 8 and 1. For example, if the majority in the block is 8, output 8, else 1. But the previous examples show inconsistencies.\n\nWait, let's count the number of 8s and 1s in each 3x3 block for Example0:\n\nFirst block (rows0-2, cols0-2):\n\n8s: 3 (row0) + 2 (row1) +3 (row2) = 8.\n\n1s: 1.\n\nOutput 8.\n\nSecond block (cols3-5, rows0-2):\n\n0s: 3 (row0) + 2 (row1) + 2 (row2) = 7.\n\n8s: 1 (row1).\n\n1s: 2 (row1 and row2).\n\nOutput 1.\n\nThird block (cols6-8, rows0-2):\n\n0s: 3 (row0) + 2 (row1) + 2 (row2) = 7.\n\n8s: 2 (row1 and row2).\n\nOutput 8.\n\nSo the output for each block is the number that is present more than the other (8 or 1), but if there are more 0s, then perhaps the rule is different. Maybe the output is 8 if there are more 8s than 1s, 1 if more 1s than 8s, and 8 if there are no 1s or 8s (all zeros). \n\nIn the second block, there are more 1s (2) than 8s (1), so output 1. In the third block, 2 8s and 0 1s \u2192 output 8.\n\nFor the first block, 8 8s and 1 1 \u2192 output 8.\n\nThis seems to work for Example0's first row.\n\nLet's check Example1's first output row [8,1,8].\n\nFirst block (cols0-2, rows0-2):\n\nRow0:0,8,8 \u2192 2 8s.\n\nRow1:0,8,1 \u2192 1 8, 1 1.\n\nRow2:0,8,8 \u2192 2 8s.\n\nTotal 8s: 5. 1s:1. Output 8.\n\nSecond block (cols3-5, rows0-2):\n\nRow0:1,0,0 \u2192 1 1.\n\nRow1:8,0,8 \u2192 2 8s.\n\nRow2:8,0,1 \u2192 1 8, 1 1.\n\nTotal 8s:3. 1s:2. So more 8s \u2192 output 8. But Example1's first output row's second element is 1. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. So this rule doesn't hold.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output elements are the value of the cell in the input's 3x3 block that is at the position corresponding to the output element. For example, output[0][0] is the top-left cell of the input's first 3x3 block. output[0][1] is the top-middle cell of the input's second 3x3 block, etc. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements are the sum of the 3x3 block's elements modulo 2, where 8 is considered as 0 and 1 as 1. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each output cell is determined by the number of times 8 and 1 appear in the corresponding 3x3 block. For example, if 8 appears in a cross shape, output 8. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nThis is taking too long, and I need to find a solution. Let's try to apply the previous hypothesis of counting 8s and 1s in each 3x3 block and outputting whichever is more, 8 if tie or no presence.\n\nApplying this to the test input's first three rows:\n\nFirst block (cols0-2, rows0-2):\n\n8,8,8\n\n8,8,8\n\n1,8,8\n\n8s: 3+3+2 = 8. 1s:1. Output 8.\n\nSecond block (cols3-5, rows0-2):\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\nAll zeros. So output 8.\n\nThird block (cols6-8, rows0-2):\n\n8,1,8\n\n1,8,1\n\n8,1,8\n\nCount 8s: row0:2, row1:1, row2:2 \u2192 total 5. 1s: row0:1, row1:2, row2:1 \u2192 total 4. So output 8.\n\nSo first output row would be [8,8,8].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, outputs have a mix. So this might not be correct.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the test input's rows3-5:\n\nRow3:0,0,0,8,1,8,0,0,0\n\nRow4:0,0,0,8,8,1,0,0,0\n\nRow5:0,0,0,1,8,8,0,0,0\n\nThe middle three columns (cols3-5) for these rows are:\n\nRow3:8,1,8\n\nRow4:8,8,1\n\nRow5:1,8,8\n\nThis is a 3x3 grid. If the output is this grid, then:\n\nRow3:8,1,8\n\nRow4:8,8,1\n\nRow5:1,8,8\n\nBut the output examples have different structures, like Example0's output doesn't match. So this might be a coincidence.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the middle three rows and columns of the input. But the test input's middle rows (3-5) and middle columns (3-5) form a 3x3 grid which is:\n\n8,1,8\n\n8,8,1\n\n1,8,8\n\nIf this is the output, then the output would be:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[8,8,1]\n\n[1,8,8]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example0's output is different. For Example0's input, the middle rows (3-5) and columns (3-5) are:\n\nRow3:0,8,8\n\nRow4:1,0,0\n\nRow5:8,0,0\n\nWhich would form:\n\n0,8,8\n\n1,0,0\n\n8,0,0\n\nBut Example0's output is:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[1,8,1]\n\n[1,8,1]\n\nSo this doesn't match. So that's not the pattern.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's think of the output structure. All outputs are 3x3 with 8 and 1. The examples often have a symmetry or alternating pattern. For example, in Example0's output, each row alternates between 8 and 1. Maybe the output is generated based on the parity of the row and column indices. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain elements from the input's 3x3 blocks. For example, for each 3x3 block in the input, take the element that is in the same position as the output's cell. Like, output cell (0,0) is the top-left element of the input's top-left 3x3 block. Let's check Example0.\n\nExample0's input top-left block (rows0-2, cols0-2):\n\nRow0:8,8,8\n\nRow1:1,8,8\n\nRow2:8,8,8\n\nThe top-left element is 8. Output cell (0,0) is 8. Correct.\n\nNext block (cols3-5, rows0-2) top-left element is 0. Output cell (0,1) is 1. Doesn't match.\n\nSo this doesn't work.\n\nAnother possibility: Each output cell is the value of the cell in the input's corresponding 3x3 block that has the same position as the output cell's position. For example, output cell (0,1) is the cell (0,1) of the second 3x3 block in the input. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's second block (cols3-5, rows0-2), the cell (0,1) is 0. Output cell (0,1) is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Time to make a educated guess based on the examples and the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input's middle rows (3-5) and their middle columns (3-5):\n\nRow3:8,1,8\n\nRow4:8,8,1\n\nRow5:1,8,8\n\nThis forms a 3x3 grid. The output examples often have a pattern where the middle of the input's middle is part of the output. Maybe the output is this middle 3x3 grid.\n\nIf so, the output for the test input would be:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[8,8,1]\n\n[1,8,8]\n\nBut looking at the training examples:\n\nExample0's middle 3x3 grid (rows3-5, cols3-5):\n\nRow3:0,8,8\n\nRow4:1,0,0\n\nRow5:8,0,0\n\nWhich would output:\n\n0,8,8\n\n1,0,0\n\n8,0,0\n\nBut the actual output for Example0 is:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[1,8,1]\n\n[1,8,1]\n\nWhich doesn't match. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is formed by taking the diagonal elements of each 3x3 block. For example, for each 3x3 block in the input, take the main diagonal elements (top-left to bottom-right) and apply some operation.\n\nFor Example0's first block:\n\n8,8,8\n\n1,8,8\n\n8,8,8\n\nThe diagonal is 8,8,8 \u2192 perhaps average or mode. Output is 8.\n\nSecond block:\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,8,1\n\n0,1,1\n\nDiagonal:0,8,1 \u2192 mode is 0 or 1. Output is 1. So not sure.\n\nThis is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I think the pattern might be that each output row corresponds to a group of three input rows, and each element in the output row is the value found at the position of the first occurrence of a 1 in the corresponding third of the input group, and 8 otherwise. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the outputs often have 8 and 1 alternating, maybe the output is generated by taking the third row of each input group and then taking every third element. For example, in Example0's first three rows:\n\nRow2:8,8,8,0,1,1,8,0,0. Taking elements 0,3,6: 8,0,8 \u2192 output [8,0,8], but the output is [8,1,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nI'm running out of ideas. Given the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input's output, perhaps the output is the middle three elements of the middle three rows. For example:\n\nRow3:0,0,0,8,1,8,0,0,0 \u2192 middle three elements are 8,1,8.\n\nRow4:0,0,0,8,8,1,0,0,0 \u2192 8,8,1.\n\nRow5:0,0,0,1,8,8,0,0,0 \u21921,8,8.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[8,8,1]\n\n[1,8,8]\n\nBut in the training examples, this doesn't hold. For example, Example0's row3 is [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0], middle three elements are 0,8,8. But the output's first row is [8,1,8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the middle three elements of the first, fifth, and ninth rows. But there are only nine rows, so fifth row is row4. For the test input:\n\nRow0:8,8,8,0,0,0,8,1,8 \u2192 middle three elements (columns3-5) are 0,0,0 \u2192 but output first row is [8,1,8].\n\nThis doesn't align.\n\nGiven that I can't find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples and the test input structure. The test input's middle rows (3-5) have a 3x3 grid with 8,1,8; 8,8,1; 1,8,8. This seems to form a pattern similar to the outputs in the examples. So perhaps the output is this 3x3 grid. Thus, the answer would be:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[8,8,1]\n\n[1,8,8]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't fit. For example, Example0's middle rows (3-5) have:\n\nRow3:0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0 \u2192 middle elements (columns3-5) 0,8,8.\n\nRow4:0,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 8,0,0.\n\nRow5:0,8,8,8,0,0,8,1,8 \u21928,0,0.\n\nSo the middle 3x3 would be:\n\n0,8,8\n\n8,0,0\n\n8,0,0\n\nWhich doesn't match Example0's output. So this is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the transpose of this middle grid. For the test input, the transpose would be:\n\n8,8,1\n\n1,8,8\n\n8,1,8\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the example patterns.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that each output element is determined by the majority of 1s and 8s in each corresponding 3x3 block of the input, with ties or all zeros resulting in 8.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFirst block (rows0-2, cols0-2):\n\n8,8,8\n\n8,8,8\n\n1,8,8\n\nCount 8s: 8. 1s:1 \u2192 output 8.\n\nSecond block (cols3-5, rows0-2):\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0 \u2192 all zeros. Output 8.\n\nThird block (cols6-8, rows0-2):\n\n8,1,8\n\n1,8,1\n\n8,1,8 \u2192 5 8s, 4 1s \u2192 output 8.\n\nFirst output row: [8,8,8].\n\nSecond output row (rows3-5):\n\nBlocks cols0-2:\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0 \u2192 all zeros \u2192 output 8.\n\ncols3-5:\n\n8,1,8\n\n8,8,1\n\n1,8,8 \u2192 8s: 5, 1s:4 \u2192 output 8.\n\ncols6-8:\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0 \u2192 output 8.\n\nSecond output row: [8,8,8].\n\nThird output row (rows6-8):\n\ncols0-2:\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0 \u2192 output 8.\n\ncols3-5:\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0 \u2192 output 8.\n\ncols6-8:\n\n1,1,8\n\n8,1,1\n\n1,1,8 \u2192 8s: 3, 1s:6 \u2192 output 1.\n\nThird output row: [8,8,1].\n\nBut this gives:\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,1]\n\nWhich doesn't match any of the training examples. So this must be incorrect.\n\nAnother guess: perhaps the output is formed by taking the first three elements of the middle row of each group of three rows. For the test input's first three rows, the middle row is row1:8,8,8,0,0,0,1,8,1 \u2192 first three elements 8,8,8 \u2192 output [8,8,8]. But the training examples don't support this.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a pattern, I'll have to make a wild guess. Looking at the test input's rows6-8:\n\nRow6:0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,8\n\nRow7:0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,1\n\nRow8:0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,8\n\nThe third block (cols6-8) of these rows has:\n\n1,1,8\n\n8,1,1\n\n1,1,8\n\nThe middle elements are 1,1,1. So perhaps output third row is [1,1,1]. But according to the examples, outputs have a mix of 8 and 1. So this isn't helpful.\n\nIn the end, I'm not confident in any pattern, but given the examples' outputs often have alternating 8 and 1, and the test input's middle section has a pattern that could be rotated or transformed, I'll guess the output is:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[1,8,1]\n\n[1,8,1]\n\nBut this is a generic pattern from the examples. Alternatively, based on the test input's middle rows:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[8,8,1]\n\n[1,8,8]\n\nWhich would be:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[8,8,1]\n\n[1,8,8]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Looking back at the examples, in Example0's output, the middle row is [1,8,1], which is an alternating pattern. So maybe the test output follows a similar pattern. Given the lack of a clear rule, I'll go with this.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices. Let's look at the training examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nThe input is a 9x9 grid (each row has 9 elements), and the output is a 3x3 grid. So the first thought is that maybe the input is divided into 3x3 blocks, and each block is processed to form the output. Since the input is 9x9, dividing into 3x3 blocks would give 9 blocks, but the output is 3x3. Wait, maybe each row of the output is derived from a corresponding 3x3 section of the input. Let me check the structure.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nEach row in the input is a list of 9 numbers. The output has three rows, each with three elements. So perhaps each row of the output is derived from a 3x3 block in the input. Let's see how that might work.\n\nWait, the input has 9 rows, each 9 elements long. So the entire input is a 9x9 grid. If we divide it into 3x3 blocks, there are 3 rows of blocks vertically and 3 columns horizontally, making 9 blocks total. But the output is 3x3. So maybe each block in the input is processed into a single element in the output. But the output elements are themselves lists of 3 elements. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, no, the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is a list of three numbers. Wait no, looking at the output for Example 0:\n\nThe output is three rows, each with three elements. Each element is a list of three numbers. Wait, no, looking at the format:\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\n[8, 1, 8]\n\n[1, 8, 1]\n\n[1, 8, 1]\n\nSo each row of the output is a list of three elements. So the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is a single number. Wait, no, the output is presented as three lists. Each list has three elements. So the output is three rows, each with three elements, making a 3x3 grid. But the input is 9x9. So maybe each 3x3 block in the input is converted into a single element in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain elements from the input. Let's look at the first example's input and output.\n\nTake Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput rows are 9 rows of 9 elements each. The output is 3 rows of 3 elements each. Let's see. For example, the first output row is [8,1,8]. Let's see where these numbers come from in the input.\n\nLooking at the first input row: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The first three elements are 8,8,8, then followed by six zeros. The second input row is [1,8,8,0,8,1,8,0,0]. Third input row: [8,8,8,0,1,1,8,0,0]. Then the fourth row starts with zeros. Maybe the output is taking elements from the non-zero regions. Alternatively, perhaps it's looking for the central element of each 3x3 block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the central 3x3 blocks of the input. Wait, the input is 9x9. The center would be at position (4,4). But the output is 3x3. Wait, perhaps the input is divided into 3x3 regions, and each region is processed to get a single value in the output. For example, the 9x9 input is divided into 3x3 blocks (each of size 3x3), and each block is mapped to a single element in the 3x3 output.\n\nBut how? Let's take Example 0's first output row [8,1,8]. Let's see the input's first three rows. The first three rows of the input are:\n\nRow 0: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [1,8,8,0,8,1,8,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [8,8,8,0,1,1,8,0,0]\n\nThen the next three rows are:\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,8,8,8,0,0,8,1,8]\n\nThen the last three rows:\n\nRow 6: [0,8,1,8,0,0,1,8,1]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,1]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nIf the input is divided into 3x3 blocks (each 3x3), then there would be 3x3 blocks (since 9/3=3). For example, the first block would be rows 0-2, columns 0-2. Then next columns 3-5, then 6-8. Similarly for rows 3-5 and 6-8.\n\nSo each output element corresponds to one of these 3x3 blocks. Let's see the first output row [8,1,8]. Maybe the first three blocks (rows 0-2, columns 0-2, 3-5, 6-8) are processed into the first output row's three elements.\n\nLooking at the first block (rows 0-2, columns 0-2):\n\nRow 0: [8,8,8]\n\nRow 1: [1,8,8]\n\nRow 2: [8,8,8]\n\nWhat's special here? The majority element is 8. But the output first element is 8. Maybe the center of the block? The center of this 3x3 block is 8 (row 1, column 1). But in the output, the first element is 8. So maybe the center of each block is taken. Let's check.\n\nFor the first block in Example 0: center is 8 (row 1, column 1 of the block). The output is 8. That matches. Let's check the second block (columns 3-5, rows 0-2):\n\nRow 0: 0,0,0\n\nRow 1: 0,8,1\n\nRow 2: 0,1,1\n\nCenter is 8 (row 1, column 4 of the input). The output's first row second element is 1. Hmm, that doesn't match. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of 8s and 1s in the block. Wait, the first output row is [8,1,8]. Let's count 8s and 1s in each block.\n\nFirst block (rows 0-2, columns 0-2):\n\nRow 0: three 8s.\n\nRow 1: 1, 8, 8 \u2192 two 8s, one 1.\n\nRow 2: three 8s.\n\nTotal 8s: 3+2+3=8? Wait, no. Each row in the block is 3 elements. So row 0: 3 8s. Row 1: 1,8,8 \u2192 2 8s. Row 2: 3 8s. Total 8s: 3+2+3=8? No, 3 elements per row \u00d73 rows =9 elements. 3+2+3=8, so 8 8s and 1 1. But the output element is 8. Maybe the majority. The majority in the first block is 8 (8 out of 9). So the output is 8. Then the second block (columns 3-5, rows 0-2):\n\nRow 0: 0,0,0 \u2192 three 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0,8,1 \u2192 8 and 1.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,1 \u2192 two 1s.\n\nSo in this block, 0s are 3+1+1=5 (row 0: 3 zeros; row1: one zero; row2: one zero). 8s: 1 (row1). 1s: 1 (row1) +2 (row2) =3. So majority is 0. But output here is 1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the non-zero elements. In this block, the non-zero elements are 8,1,1,1. So four elements: one 8 and three 1s. The majority is 1, so output 1. That matches the second element in the first output row (8,1,8). The third block (columns 6-8, rows 0-2):\n\nRow 0: 0,0,0.\n\nRow 1:8,0,0.\n\nRow2:8,0,0.\n\nSo non-zero elements: 8,8. Majority 8. So output 8. The third element in the first row of output is 8. So that fits. So maybe for each 3x3 block in the input, the output is the majority of non-zero elements. If all are zero, maybe it's zero. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the second row of the output is [1,8,1]. Let's look at the blocks for the second row of the output. The second row of the output would correspond to the middle three rows of the input (rows 3-5). Let's take the first block of these rows (columns 0-2):\n\nRow3: [0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,8,8]\n\nRow5: [0,8,8]\n\nNon-zero elements: 8,8,8,8 (four 8s). So majority is 8, but the output here is 1. Wait, that's conflicting. So this can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another pattern. Let's look at the output for Example 0. The output is three rows. Each row in the output has three elements. Let's see:\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[1,8,1]\n\n[1,8,1]\n\nWait, each row alternates between 8 and 1, but that's maybe a coincidence. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1's output:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[1,1,8]\n\n[8,8,1]\n\nHmm, not the same pattern. Maybe the output is derived from some other pattern. Let's consider that each output element is the center of the corresponding 3x3 block in the input. For Example 0's first output row first element: center of the first block (rows 0-2, columns 0-2). The center is (1,1) of the block, which is row1, column1 in the input. For input Example 0, row1 is [1,8,8,0,8,1,8,0,0]. So column1 is 8. So output element 8. That matches. The second element in the first output row would be the center of the next block (columns3-5, rows0-2). The center is row1, column4. Input row1, column4 is 8. But the output element here is 1. That doesn't match. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the center element of each 3x3 block in the input. Wait, the input is 9x9, divided into 3x3 blocks. Each block is 3x3. So the output would have 3x3 elements, each being the center of their respective block. For Example 0:\n\nFirst block (rows0-2, cols0-2) center is row1, col1 (input row1, col1: 8). Output first element is 8. Correct.\n\nSecond block (rows0-2, cols3-5). Center is row1, col4. Input row1, col4: 8. Output first row second element is 1. Not matching. So that can't be it.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let's look at the positions of 8 and 1 in the input and see how they form the output. For example, maybe the output is capturing some pattern of 8 and 1 in the input.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, each row has three elements. The first row of the output is [8,1,8]. Let's look at the input's first three rows and see if there's a pattern. Alternatively, maybe the output rows are derived from the input's rows 0,3,6 or something. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the three middle elements of certain rows. For instance, in the input, each row has 9 elements. The middle three would be positions 3,4,5. But the outputs are 3 elements per row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the three middle columns of the three middle rows. For a 9x9 grid, the middle three rows are 3,4,5, and middle three columns are 3,4,5. Let's check Example 0's input rows 3-5:\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,8,8,8,0,0,8,1,8]\n\nThe middle columns (3,4,5) would be:\n\nRow3: 0,8,8\n\nRow4: 1,0,0\n\nRow5:8,0,0\n\nBut the output for Example0 is:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[1,8,1]\n\n[1,8,1]\n\nThis doesn't match. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is derived from the positions where there's a transition between 8, 1, and 0. For example, maybe the output represents the non-zero elements along a certain path in the input.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the input might represent a grid where 8 and 1 are some kind of markers, and the output is the result of applying a rule similar to the Game of Life, where cells are updated based on their neighbors. But given that the output is a smaller grid, perhaps each output cell is derived from a 3x3 section of the input.\n\nWait, maybe each 3x3 section in the input is being transformed into a single element in the output by taking the majority of 8 and 1, ignoring zeros. Let's test this with Example0.\n\nFirst block (rows0-2, cols0-2):\n\nNumbers are:\n\n8,8,8\n\n1,8,8\n\n8,8,8\n\nTotal 8's: 8 elements (the first row has 3, second row has 2 (since 1 is present), third row has 3). Total 3+2+3=8 8's and 1 1. So majority is 8. Output is 8. Correct.\n\nSecond block (rows0-2, cols3-5):\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,8,1\n\n0,1,1\n\nNon-zero elements: 8,1,1,1. So three 1's and one 8. Majority is 1. Output is 1. Correct.\n\nThird block (rows0-2, cols6-8):\n\n0,0,0\n\n8,0,0\n\n8,0,0\n\nNon-zero elements: two 8's. Majority is 8. Output is 8. Correct.\n\nSecond row of output [1,8,1]. Let's look at the middle three rows (rows3-5) of the input.\n\nFirst block (rows3-5, cols0-2):\n\nRow3:0,0,0\n\nRow4:0,8,8\n\nRow5:0,8,8\n\nNon-zero elements: 8's (four in total). Majority is 8. But output is 1. Hmm, this doesn't fit. So this theory is invalid.\n\nWait, but the output element for this block is 1. So this can't be right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's not the majority, but something else. Let's count the number of 1's and 8's in each 3x3 block. For example, if the block has more 8's than 1's, output is 8. Otherwise, 1. If they are equal, maybe 1?\n\nWait, in Example0's output second row first element is 1. Let's check the corresponding block. That's rows3-5, cols0-2:\n\nRow3:0,0,0\n\nRow4:0,8,8\n\nRow5:0,8,8\n\nSo non-zero elements are 8,8,8,8 (four 8's). So output should be 8. But the output here is 1. So that's conflicting. So that theory is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is formed by taking the three elements from the center of each third row. For example, the first output row could be the center elements of the first three rows. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nFirst three rows:\n\nRow0: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 center element (position4) is 0.\n\nRow1: [1,8,8,0,8,1,8,0,0] \u2192 center is 8.\n\nRow2: [8,8,8,0,1,1,8,0,0] \u2192 center is 1.\n\nSo if we take the centers of the first three rows, we get 0,8,1. But the first output row is [8,1,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the diagonals of certain blocks. For example, each output element is a triplet from the diagonal of a 3x3 block. Let's check Example0's output first row [8,1,8].\n\nAssuming the first output row comes from the top-left 3x3 block's diagonal. The diagonal elements of the first block (rows0-2, cols0-2) are 8 (row0, col0), 8 (row1, col1), 8 (row2, col2). So diagonal is [8,8,8]. But the output is [8,1,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the middle row of each 3x3 block. For example, the first block's middle row is [1,8,8]. Then, take the middle element of that row (8). That would fit the first element. The second block's middle row is [0,8,1], middle element 8. But the output's first row second element is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[1,8,1]\n\n[1,8,1]\n\nEach row alternates between 8 and 1. Maybe it's a checkerboard pattern. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by looking at the sum of 8s and 1s in each 3x3 block. For example, if sum of 8s is greater than sum of 1s, output 8; else 1. Let's test this.\n\nFor the first block in Example0:\n\nNumber of 8s: 3 (row0) +2 (row1) +3 (row2) =8.\n\nNumber of 1s:1 (row1). So 8>1 \u2192 output 8. Correct.\n\nSecond block (rows0-2, cols3-5):\n\nNumber of 8s:1 (row1, col4).\n\nNumber of 1s:1 (row1, col5) + 2 (row2, cols4-5) \u2192 total 3.\n\nSo 1 <3 \u2192 output 1. Correct.\n\nThird block (rows0-2, cols6-8):\n\nNumber of 8s:1 (row1, col6) +1 (row2, col6) \u2192 2.\n\nNumber of 1s:0. So output 8. Correct.\n\nSecond row of output [1,8,1]. Let's check the blocks in rows3-5.\n\nFirst block (rows3-5, cols0-2):\n\nRow3: all zeros.\n\nRow4:0,8,8 \u2192 two 8s.\n\nRow5:0,8,8 \u2192 two 8s.\n\nTotal 8s:4, 1s:0. So output should be 8, but output here is 1. Doesn't fit. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm, maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at the positions of 8 and 1 in the input and see how they correspond to the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the middle 3x3 of the input's middle 3x3. For example, the entire input is 9x9. The middle 3x3 would be rows 3-5, cols3-5. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example0's input, the middle 3x3 (rows3-5, cols3-5):\n\nRow3:0,8,8\n\nRow4:1,0,0\n\nRow5:8,0,0\n\nSo the middle 3x3 is:\n\n[0,8,8]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0]\n\nBut the output is three rows of three elements. Doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternative idea: The output might be formed by taking every third element from certain rows. For example, each output row is made by taking the 0th, 3rd, 6th elements of the corresponding input row. Let's check Example0's output:\n\nFirst output row [8,1,8]. Let's see if these elements are in the input's first three rows. For example, the first output element 8 could be from row0, column0. The second element 1 from row0, column3 (but row0, column3 is 0). Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by the first three elements of the middle row of each 3x3 block. For example, for each 3x3 block in the input, take the middle row's first three elements. But that's not leading to the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the transpose of a certain part of the input. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output, the second row of the output is [1,8,1]. Let's look at the input's row4, which is [0,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0]. The middle of this row is 0. But the output's second row is 1,8,1. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is formed by looking at the positions where 8 and 1 are adjacent. For example, counting the number of transitions between 8 and 1 in each block. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output element is derived from the corresponding position in three different 3x3 grids. For example, the input is divided into three 3x3 grids, each of which is processed into a row of the output. But not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the combination of three elements from the input's diagonal. For example, the output's first row is the first three elements of the input's main diagonal, the second row the next three, etc. Let's see.\n\nThe main diagonal of the input matrix (9x9) would be elements [0][0], [1][1], ..., [8][8]. Let's check Example0's main diagonal:\n\n0:8, 1:8, 2:8, 3:0, 4:0, 5:8, 6:1, 7:8, 8:0.\n\nSo the main diagonal elements are 8,8,8,0,0,8,1,8,0.\n\nIf we group them into three groups of three:\n\n[8,8,8], [0,0,8], [1,8,0]. But the output for Example0 is three rows of three elements each. So the first output row is [8,1,8], which doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, this is getting frustrating. Let's look for another angle.\n\nLooking at the output examples, the outputs are 3x3 matrices consisting of 8s and 1s. The inputs are 9x9 matrices with 8s, 1s, and 0s. Maybe the output is a compressed version of the input where each 3x3 block in the input is converted into a single value in the output based on some rule.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is the number of 8-1 transitions in each 3x3 block. For example, each time an 8 is adjacent to a 1, it counts as a transition. But how would that translate to the output numbers?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of 8s and 1s in the block modulo something. But the output elements are 8 and 1, which are the same as the input's non-zero elements. So maybe the output is the most frequent non-zero element in each block, and if there's a tie, it's 1. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example0's second block (rows0-2, cols3-5):\n\nNon-zero elements: 8,1,1,1. So three 1s and one 8. Majority is 1. Output is 1. Correct.\n\nFor the block in rows3-5, cols0-2:\n\nNon-zero elements are four 8s. Output element is 1. Wait, that's conflicting. So this theory is wrong.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the second row first element is 1. The corresponding block (rows3-5, cols0-2) has four 8s. So majority is 8. But output is 1. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the middle element of the block if it's non-zero. Otherwise, the majority of non-zero elements. Let's check.\n\nFor rows3-5, cols0-2 block:\n\nRow3:0,0,0\n\nRow4:0,8,8\n\nRow5:0,8,8\n\nThe middle element is row4, col1 (input row4, column1:8). So the output should be 8. But in Example0's output, the second row first element is 1. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is the reverse of the majority. Like if majority is 8, output 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the presence of a certain pattern in the 3x3 block. For example, if there's a 1 in the center, output 1. Otherwise, output 8. Let's check.\n\nFor Example0's first block, the center is 8 \u2192 output 8. Correct.\n\nSecond block's center is 8 (row1, col4). Output is 1. Doesn't match.\n\nThird block's center is 0 (row1, col7). But output is 8. So this idea is invalid.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is formed by looking at the positions where the input has a 8 or 1 in a cross pattern. For example, the output elements are taken from the positions where a cross (horizontal and vertical) of 8 and 1 exists. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as a larger grid, and the output as a smaller grid where each cell represents a 3x3 area. Perhaps the output cell is 8 if there's an 8 in the corresponding 3x3 area's top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right positions. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is created by taking the first, fifth, and ninth elements of each 3x3 block and concatenating them. For example, each block is arranged as:\n\na b c\n\nd e f\n\ng h i\n\nThen the output element is [a, e, i]. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example0's first block (rows0-2, cols0-2):\n\na=8, b=8, c=8\n\nd=1, e=8, f=8\n\ng=8, h=8, i=8\n\nSo a=8, e=8, i=8 \u2192 output [8,8,8]. But the first output element is [8,1,8]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is the diagonal of each block. For Example0's first block, diagonal is 8,8,8 \u2192 output [8,8,8], but the output is [8,1,8]. So not matching.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is derived from the count of 8s and 1s in each row of the block. For each row in the block, if there are more 8s, take 8; if more 1s, take 1; else 0. Then combine these three for each row of the output.\n\nFor Example0's first block (rows0-2):\n\nRow0: all 8s \u2192 8.\n\nRow1: two 8s and one 1 \u2192 8.\n\nRow2: three 8s \u21928.\n\nSo combining these three, the output element would be [8,8,8], but the first output row is [8,1,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row is the first element of each of the three rows in the block. For example, first block rows0-2, columns0-2: first elements are 8,1,8. Which matches the first output row's first element [8,1,8] as a list. Wait, no. The first output row is [8,1,8], which would be the first elements of each row in the first block. That would fit. Let's check:\n\nFirst block's rows0-2, cols0-2: first elements are 8 (row0), 1 (row1), 8 (row2). So combined as [8,1,8], which matches the first output row.\n\nSecond block's first elements (rows0-2, cols3-5):\n\nRow0, col3:0.\n\nRow1, col3:0.\n\nRow2, col3:0.\n\nSo output would be [0,0,0]. But the first output row's second element is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, but wait, maybe it's the first three columns of each block. For example, the first block's first three columns are rows0-2, cols0-2. The output for the first row's first element is the first column of this block. But no, the output is a single value, not a list. Wait, the output examples have each row as a list of three elements. So perhaps each output row corresponds to a row of blocks, and each element in the output row corresponds to three elements taken from the respective block's columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element is a triplet taken from the center of each 3x3 block. For example, each block's center row and center column. Let's see.\n\nIn the first block of Example0, the center is 8 (row1, col1). The output's first element is 8. But the output elements are triplets, not single values. Wait, no, looking back, the output for each example is three rows, each with three elements. Each element is a list of three numbers. Wait, no, the output in Example0 is three lists, each with three elements. Wait, looking at the given examples, the output format is written as three lines, each with a list of three elements. So the output is a 3x3 matrix, where each cell contains a single value (either 8 or 1). So the output is not lists of three numbers but individual numbers arranged in 3 rows of 3 elements each. My mistake earlier.\n\nSo the output is a 3x3 grid, each cell being 8 or 1. So the challenge is to figure out how each cell in the 3x3 output is determined from the corresponding 3x3 block in the 9x9 input.\n\nNow, the input is a 9x9 grid divided into 3x3 blocks. Each output cell corresponds to a 3x3 block in the input. For each block, what's the rule to get the output value (8 or 1)?\n\nLet's re-examine Example0:\n\nFirst block (rows0-2, cols0-2):\n\n8 8 8\n\n1 8 8\n\n8 8 8\n\nOutput is 8.\n\nSecond block (rows0-2, cols3-5):\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 8 1\n\n0 1 1\n\nOutput is 1.\n\nThird block (rows0-2, cols6-8):\n\n0 0 0\n\n8 0 0\n\n8 0 0\n\nOutput is 8.\n\nSecond row of output: 1,8,1.\n\nFirst block of second row (rows3-5, cols0-2):\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 8 8\n\n0 8 8\n\nOutput is 1.\n\nSecond block (rows3-5, cols3-5):\n\n0 8 8\n\n1 0 0\n\n8 0 0\n\nOutput is 8.\n\nThird block (rows3-5, cols6-8):\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\n8 1 8\n\nOutput is 1.\n\nThird row of output: 1,8,1.\n\nFirst block of third row (rows6-8, cols0-2):\n\n0 8 1\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\nOutput is 1.\n\nSecond block (rows6-8, cols3-5):\n\n8 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\nOutput is 8.\n\nThird block (rows6-8, cols6-8):\n\n1 8 1\n\n1 8 1\n\n0 0 0\n\nOutput is 1.\n\nHmm, now looking for patterns in these blocks and their outputs.\n\nLooking at the first block of Example0's output (8), the corresponding input block has a lot of 8s. The second block (output 1) has more 1s than 8s. But the second row's first block (output 1) has four 8s and no 1s. So this contradicts the majority idea.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is determined by the presence of a certain pattern in the block. For example, if the block contains a 1, then output 1; else output 8. But this doesn't fit. For example, the third block of the first row has two 8s and no 1s, but output is 8. That works. The first block of the second row has four 8s and output 1, which contradicts.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is the value of the cell in the center of the block if it's non-zero. If the center is zero, then look for the majority of non-zero cells in the block.\n\nLet's check:\n\nFirst block of Example0: center is 8 \u2192 output 8. Correct.\n\nSecond block of Example0: center is 8 (row1, col4). But output is 1. Wait, no. Wait, the second block is in cols3-5, rows0-2. The center of this block is row1, col4. Input row1, col4 is 8. So output should be 8, but actual output is 1. Contradiction.\n\nHmm. This isn't working. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nMaybe the output is determined by the number of 1s and 8s in the entire row or column of the block. Or perhaps the first non-zero element in the block.\n\nFor the first block of Example0's second row (rows3-5, cols0-2):\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 8 8\n\n0 8 8\n\nThe first non-zero element is 8 (row4, col1). So output 8. But the output is 1. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is determined by the sum of 8s and 1s in the block. If the sum of 8s is even, output 8; else 1. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, think of 8 and 1 as representing something else, like players in a game. Maybe the output is determined by the winner of a game played on each block. For example, 8s and 1s are competing, and the output is the winner based on some rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the result of applying a convolutional filter. For example, each output cell is the result of multiplying the block by a kernel and summing. But the output is binary (8 or 1), which doesn't fit.\n\nLet's try to look at another example. Example1's input and output.\n\nExample1's input is a 9x9 grid, and output is:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[1,1,8]\n\n[8,8,1]\n\nLet's look at the first output row's first element 8. Corresponding block (rows0-2, cols0-2):\n\nRow0:0,8,8\n\nRow1:0,8,1\n\nRow2:0,8,8\n\nNon-zero elements: eight 8s and one 1. Majority is 8. Output is 8. Correct.\n\nSecond block (rows0-2, cols3-5):\n\n1,0,0\n\n8,0,8\n\n8,0,1\n\nNon-zero elements:1,8,8,8,1 \u2192 three 8s and two 1s. Majority is 8. But output is 1. So contradiction.\n\nHmm, this is perplexing.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the test input and see if we can find a pattern based on the examples, even if not fully understanding it.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[8,8,8,0,0,0,8,1,8]\n\n[8,8,8,0,0,0,1,8,1]\n\n[1,8,8,0,0,0,8,1,8]\n\n[0,0,0,8,1,8,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,8,8,1,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,1,8,8,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,1]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,8]\n\nExpected output is a 3x3 grid. Let's imagine that each block is 3x3, and the output is determined by certain rules.\n\nLooking at the test input's first three rows (block for first output row first element):\n\nRow0:8,8,8,0,0,0,8,1,8\n\nRow1:8,8,8,0,0,0,1,8,1\n\nRow2:1,8,8,0,0,0,8,1,8\n\nSo the first block (cols0-2, rows0-2):\n\n8,8,8\n\n8,8,8\n\n1,8,8\n\nNon-zero elements: all 8s except one 1. Majority is 8. So output could be 8.\n\nThe second block (cols3-5, rows0-2):\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\nAll zeros. So what's the output? In previous examples, when a block has all zeros, the output might default to 1 or 8. But looking at the training examples, I don't see such a case. Let's check Example3's input. For example, in Example3's input, perhaps there's a block with all zeros. Let's look:\n\nExample3's input:\n\nRow0:0,0,1,1,8,0,0,0,0\n\nRow1:0,0,8,8,1,0,8,1,1\n\nRow2:0,0,1,1,8,0,1,1,1\n\nRow3:0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,8\n\nRow4:8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow5:8,8,1,0,8,1,8,0,0\n\nRow6:1,8,8,0,1,8,8,0,0\n\nRow7:0,0,0,0,8,8,1,0,0\n\nRow8:0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nLooking for a block with all zeros. For example, rows6-8, cols0-2:\n\nRow6:1,8,8\n\nRow7:0,0,0\n\nRow8:0,0,0\n\nSo this block has 1,8,8 in the first row, then zeros. Non-zero elements are 1,8,8. Majority is 8. Output is 8,1,8 in the third row of Example3's output. So the third row first element is 8. So even if there are non-zero elements, the majority is considered.\n\nBut in the test input's second block (cols3-5, rows0-2) are all zeros. So no non-zero elements. So what's the output here? In such a case, maybe the output is 1. But how to determine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for a block with all zeros is 1. Let's see. But in the examples, perhaps there are no such blocks. For Example0, there are no all-zero blocks. In Example1, perhaps?\n\nExample1's input:\n\nRow0:0,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow1:0,8,1,8,0,8,1,8,0\n\nRow2:0,8,8,8,0,1,8,8,0\n\nRow3:0,0,0,0,0,8,8,1,0\n\nRow4:0,0,8,1,8,0,0,0,0\n\nRow5:0,0,1,1,8,0,0,0,0\n\nRow6:0,0,8,8,1,0,8,8,8\n\nRow7:0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8\n\nRow8:0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,8\n\nLooking for a block with all zeros. For example, rows3-5, cols0-2:\n\nRow3:0,0,0\n\nRow4:0,0,8\n\nRow5:0,0,1\n\nSo non-zero elements are 8 and 1. So majority would be maybe 8 and 1. But the output for Example1's second row first element is 1. Not sure.\n\nBut in the test input's case, the second block (cols3-5, rows0-2) are all zeros. So maybe the output for that is 1.\n\nContinuing with the test input's third block (cols6-8, rows0-2):\n\n8,1,8\n\n1,8,1\n\n8,1,8\n\nNon-zero elements: multiple 8s and 1s. Let's count:\n\n8,1,8 \u2192 2 8s, 1.\n\n1,8,1 \u2192 1 8, 2 1s.\n\n8,1,8 \u2192 2 8s, 1.\n\nTotal 8s: 2 +1 +2=5.\n\n1s:1+2+1=4.\n\nMajority is 8. So output would be 8.\n\nSo the first row of the output would be [8,1,8].\n\nNow, the second row of the output corresponds to the blocks in rows3-5.\n\nFirst block (cols0-2, rows3-5):\n\nRow3:0,0,0\n\nRow4:0,0,0\n\nRow5:0,0,0\n\nAll zeros. So output might be 1.\n\nSecond block (cols3-5, rows3-5):\n\n8,1,8\n\n8,8,1\n\n1,8,8\n\nNon-zero elements. Count 8s and 1s.\n\nRow3:8,1,8 \u2192 2 8s, 1.\n\nRow4:8,8,1 \u2192 2 8s, 1.\n\nRow5:1,8,8 \u2192 2 8s, 1.\n\nTotal 8s:2+2+2=6.\n\n1s:1+1+1=3.\n\nMajority 8 \u2192 output 8.\n\nThird block (cols6-8, rows3-5):\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\nAll zeros. So output 1.\n\nSo the second row of the output would be [1,8,1].\n\nThird row of the output corresponds to blocks in rows6-8.\n\nFirst block (cols0-2, rows6-8):\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\nAll zeros \u2192 output 1.\n\nSecond block (cols3-5, rows6-8):\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\nAll zeros \u2192 output 1.\n\nThird block (cols6-8, rows6-8):\n\n1,1,8\n\n8,1,1\n\n1,1,8\n\nCount 8s and 1s:\n\nRow6:1,1,8 \u2192 two 1s, one 8.\n\nRow7:8,1,1 \u2192 one 8, two 1s.\n\nRow8:1,1,8 \u2192 two 1s, one 8.\n\nTotal 8s: 1+1+1=3.\n\n1s: 2+2+2=6.\n\nMajority is 1 \u2192 output 1.\n\nSo the third row of the output would be [1,1,1]. But wait, in Example0's output, the third row is [1,8,1]. So maybe the middle block of the third row has a different rule.\n\nWait, in the test input's third row of blocks, the second block is all zeros. So output is 1. Third block is majority 1. So third row output would be [1,1,1].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, like Example0's third row is [1,8,1]. The middle block in that row's blocks (cols3-5, rows6-8):\n\nRow6:0,0,1\n\nRow7:0,0,8\n\nRow8:0,0,1\n\nNon-zero elements: 1,8,1. Majority 1. So output 1. But Example0's third row middle element is 8. So this contradicts. So my theory must be wrong.\n\nThis suggests that the majority of non-zero elements is not the correct approach.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the output is determined by the number of 8s and 1s in the block's perimeter. For example, the perimeter of the 3x3 block is the outer cells, ignoring the center. If there are more 8s, output 8; else 1.\n\nFor Example0's first block:\n\nPerimeter elements (excluding center):\n\nRow0:8,8,8\n\nRow1:1,8\n\nRow2:8,8,8\n\nPlus row1's third element 8.\n\nWait, the perimeter of a 3x3 block is the outer 8 cells. The center is excluded. So for the first block:\n\nPerimeter has 8 elements. Count 8s and 1s.\n\nRow0: three 8s.\n\nRow1:1 and 8 (first and third elements).\n\nRow2: three 8s.\n\nSo perimeter elements: 8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8. That's seven 8s and one 1. Majority 8 \u2192 output 8. Correct.\n\nSecond block (Example0's first row, second element output 1):\n\nPerimeter elements: rows0-2, cols3-5.\n\nRow0:0,0,0 \u2192 three zeros.\n\nRow1:0,8,1 \u2192 0,1 (perimeter elements are 0 and 1).\n\nRow2:0,1,1 \u21920,1,1.\n\nSo perimeter elements (excluding center 8):\n\n0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1. Non-zero elements:1,1,1. Majority 1 \u2192 output 1. Correct.\n\nThird block (Example0's first row third element):\n\nPerimeter elements: rows0-2, cols6-8.\n\nRow0:0,0,0 \u2192 three zeros.\n\nRow1:8,0,0 \u2192 8 and 0.\n\nRow2:8,0,0 \u21928 and 0.\n\nPerimeter elements (excluding center 0): 0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0. Non-zero elements: two 8s. Majority 8 \u2192 output 8. Correct.\n\nNow, let's check Example0's second row first element (output 1). The block is rows3-5, cols0-2.\n\nPerimeter elements:\n\nRow3:0,0,0 \u2192 three zeros.\n\nRow4:0,8,8 \u21920 and 8.\n\nRow5:0,8,8 \u21920 and 8.\n\nPerimeter elements (excluding center 8):\n\n0,0,0,0,8,0,8,8. Non-zero elements: three 8s. Majority 8 \u2192 output should be 8. But the output is 1. Contradiction.\n\nHmm, so this theory also fails.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is the value of the top-left non-zero element in the block. If all are zero, output 1.\n\nFor Example0's first block: top-left is 8 \u2192 output 8. Correct.\n\nSecond block: top-left is 0. Next non-zero in row-major order is 8 (row1, col4). So output 8. But output is 1. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the first non-zero element in the block. For the second block, first non-zero is row1, col4 (8). Output is 1. So doesn't fit.\n\nThis is challenging. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input's first block (rows0-2, cols0-2):\n\n8 8 8\n\n8 8 8\n\n1 8 8\n\nPerimeter elements (excluding center 8):\n\nRow0:8,8,8\n\nRow1:8,8 \u2192 8 and 8.\n\nRow2:1,8,8 \u21921,8.\n\nSo perimeter elements: 8,8,8,8,8,1,8. Non-zero: all 8s except one 1. Majority 8 \u2192 output 8.\n\nSecond block (rows0-2, cols3-5): all zeros \u2192 output 1.\n\nThird block (rows0-2, cols6-8):\n\n8 1 8\n\n1 8 1\n\n8 1 8\n\nPerimeter elements (excluding center 8):\n\n8,1,8,1,1,8,1,8. Non-zero: five 8s and three 1s. Majority 8 \u2192 output 8.\n\nSo first output row would be [8,1,8].\n\nSecond row of output corresponds to rows3-5:\n\nFirst block (cols0-2, rows3-5):\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\nAll zeros \u2192 output 1.\n\nSecond block (cols3-5, rows3-5):\n\n8 1 8\n\n8 8 1\n\n1 8 8\n\nPerimeter elements (excluding center 8):\n\n8,1,8,8,1,1,8,8. Non-zero: eight elements. Let's count 8s and 1s:\n\n8,1,8 \u2192 two 8s, one 1.\n\n8,1 \u2192 8 and 1.\n\n1,8,8 \u2192 8, 8.\n\nTotal 8s: 2+1+2=5.\n\n1s:1+1=2. Majority 8 \u2192 output 8.\n\nThird block (cols6-8, rows3-5):\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\nAll zeros \u2192 output 1.\n\nSo second output row is [1,8,1].\n\nThird output row corresponds to rows6-8:\n\nFirst block (cols0-2): all zeros \u2192 output 1.\n\nSecond block (cols3-5): all zeros \u2192 output 1.\n\nThird block (cols6-8, rows6-8):\n\n1 1 8\n\n8 1 1\n\n1 1 8\n\nPerimeter elements (excluding center 1):\n\n1,1,8,8,1,1,1,8. Count 8s: 3. 1s:5. Majority 1 \u2192 output 1.\n\nSo third output row is [1,1,1].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, like Example0's third row is [1,8,1]. Let's check if this theory holds.\n\nFor Example0's third row first block (rows6-8, cols0-2):\n\n0 8 1\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\nPerimeter elements (excluding center 0):\n\n0,8,1,0,0,0,0,0. Non-zero elements: 8 and 1. Majority is 8 (one 8 and one 1). So tie? How is this handled?\n\nIn Example0's output, the first element of the third row is 1. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nHmm, this is really tough. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should consider that the pattern is to look at the number of 8's and 1's in the entire 3x3 block, and if the count of 8's is even, output 1, else output 8. But let's check.\n\nExample0's first block: 8's count is 8 \u2192 even \u2192 output 1. But output is 8. So no.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is determined by the presence of a 1 in the block. If there's at least one 1, output 1; else output 8. Let's test.\n\nExample0's first block has one 1 \u2192 output 1. But the output is 8. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the majority of non-zero elements are 8, output 8; else 1. But earlier examples show this doesn't hold.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the output in the test input based on the examples, even without fully understanding the pattern. For instance, notice that in each example, the output has a certain symmetry. For example, Example0's output is:\n\n8 1 8\n\n1 8 1\n\n1 8 1\n\nWhich is symmetric in a way. The test input's output might have a similar pattern. Looking at the test input's structure, especially the central block (rows3-5, cols3-5):\n\n8 1 8\n\n8 8 1\n\n1 8 8\n\nWhich has a mix of 8s and 1s. The output for this block might be 8.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be the middle element of each block. For the central block of the test input's rows3-5, cols3-5: the center is 8 (row4, col4). So output 8.\n\nBut how does this fit with the examples? For Example0's central block (rows3-5, cols3-5):\n\n0 8 8\n\n1 0 0\n\n8 0 0\n\nCenter is 0. But output is 8. So that's not it.\n\nAt this point, I think I've exhausted various possibilities and the most plausible pattern I can find is that each output element is the majority of non-zero elements in the corresponding 3x3 block of the input. Despite the earlier contradiction in Example0's second row first element, maybe there's an exception for certain cases. Or perhaps there's a different rule when the majority is a tie.\n\nBut given time constraints, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and apply it to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nEach output element is determined by the majority of non-zero elements in the corresponding 3x3 block.\n\nTest input's first block (cols0-2, rows0-2):\n\n8,8,8\n\n8,8,8\n\n1,8,8\n\nNon-zero elements: 8s: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1 \u2192 8 8s and 1 1. Majority 8 \u2192 output 8.\n\nSecond block (cols3-5, rows0-2):\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\nAll zeros. No non-zero elements. So maybe output 1 (default).\n\nThird block (cols6-8, rows0-2):\n\n8,1,8\n\n1,8,1\n\n8,1,8\n\nNon-zero elements: count 8s and 1s.\n\nRow0:8,1,8 \u2192 2 8s, 1.\n\nRow1:1,8,1 \u21921 8, 2 1s.\n\nRow2:8,1,8 \u21922 8s, 1.\n\nTotal 8s: 2+1+2=5.\n\n1s:1+2+1=4.\n\nMajority 8 \u2192 output 8.\n\nSo first output row: [8,1,8].\n\nSecond row (rows3-5):\n\nFirst block (cols0-2, rows3-5):\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\nAll zeros \u2192 output 1.\n\nSecond block (cols3-5, rows3-5):\n\n8,1,8\n\n8,8,1\n\n1,8,8\n\nNon-zero elements: count 8s and 1s.\n\nRow3:8,1,8 \u2192 2 8s, 1.\n\nRow4:8,8,1 \u21922 8s, 1.\n\nRow5:1,8,8 \u21922 8s, 1.\n\nTotal 8s: 2+2+2=6.\n\n1s:1+1+1=3.\n\nMajority 8 \u2192 output 8.\n\nThird block (cols6-8, rows3-5):\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\nAll zeros \u2192 output 1.\n\nSecond output row: [1,8,1].\n\nThird row (rows6-8):\n\nFirst block (cols0-2, rows6-8):\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\nAll zeros \u2192 output 1.\n\nSecond block (cols3-5, rows6-8):\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\n0,0,0\n\nAll zeros \u2192 output 1.\n\nThird block (cols6-8, rows6-8):\n\n1,1,8\n\n8,1,1\n\n1,1,8\n\nNon-zero elements: count 1s and 8s.\n\nRow6:1,1,8 \u21922 1s, 1 8.\n\nRow7:8,1,1 \u21921 8, 2 1s.\n\nRow8:1,1,8 \u21922 1s, 1 8.\n\nTotal 8s: 1+1+1=3.\n\n1s:2+2+2=6.\n\nMajority 1 \u2192 output 1.\n\nThird output row: [1,1,1].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, like Example0's output has three rows, but the third row's middle element is 8. In this case, the test input's third row's middle block is all zeros \u2192 output 1. So this seems consistent.\n\nBut according to this, the test input's output would be:\n\n[8,1,8]\n\n[1,8,1]\n\n[1,1,1]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, for example Example0's output has a third row of [1,8,1], which suggests that even if the block has non-zero elements, the middle element might be derived differently. But in our test input, the third row's middle block is all zeros, so output 1.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the patterns I've tried, I think this is the most plausible answer.",
