        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples, and then apply that pattern to the test input. Let me start by carefully analyzing the training examples to spot any consistent changes.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the input has a lot of 9s and some 1s arranged in a certain pattern. The output changes some of the 1s to 8s, but not all. For instance, the third row in the input is [9, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], and the output becomes [9, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9]. So the first three 1s turned into 8s, but the 1 in position 7 (0-based index 7) stayed as 1. Hmm, why is that? Maybe there's a condition based on the position or the surrounding elements.\n\nLooking at other examples might help. In Example 1, the input has some 1s that are replaced by 8s. For example, the second row's input [9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 1] becomes [9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 1, 9, 1]. So again, some 1s become 8s, others stay. It seems like 1s that are part of certain shapes or sequences are being replaced. Maybe it's about contiguous 1s forming specific patterns, like lines or crosses.\n\nWait, maybe the 1s that are part of a horizontal or vertical line of at least three? Let me check. In Example 0's input, the third row has three consecutive 1s (positions 1-3), which become 8s. The 1 in position 7 is alone, so it remains. In Example 1, the first row's input has five consecutive 1s (positions 1-5) which all become 8s. The row below has 1s at the start and end (positions 0 and 5?), but the middle ones are 9s. Wait, maybe it's about being part of a horizontal line of 3 or more 1s. But in Example 0's input, the row with three 1s becomes 8s. But in Example 2, looking at the third input row [9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9], which becomes [9,8,8,8,8,9,...], so four consecutive 1s replaced by 8s. So maybe any horizontal consecutive 1s of length >=3 are replaced by 8s. But wait, in Example 3's input, there's a row [9,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,...] which becomes all 8s. So that fits. But what about vertical lines? Let's see. In Example 1's test input, maybe vertical 1s are also considered. For example, looking at the test input in Example 1's output, the last few rows have some vertical 1s turned into 8s. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that any 1 that is part of a horizontal or vertical line of exactly three 1s is replaced by 8. But that might not fit all cases.\n\nWait, maybe it's a different approach. Let me think of another angle. The 8s in the output could be replacing the 1s that form certain shapes, like the number '1' as a digit. But that might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the 1s that are in the \"middle\" of a group are turned into 8s. But looking at Example 0's input, the 1s in row 3 are consecutive, so perhaps the entire group is converted. But in the output, all those 1s become 8s, except perhaps the ones that are part of a vertical line. Wait, maybe the 8s are replacing 1s that are part of horizontal lines of three or more, and vertical lines of three or more. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the third row's 1s are three in a row (horizontal), replaced by 8s. The 1 in row 4, column 6 (assuming 0-based) is part of a vertical line? Let's see. In input row 4: [9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9]. The 1 at index 6 is followed by three more 1s (indices 7-10?), but in the output, the first 1 (index 1) becomes 8, and the ones at index 3 and 6? Wait, the output row is [9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9]. Hmm, maybe that's not vertical. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing 1s that form the outline of a square or a rectangle. But that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s that form the perimeter of a region are replaced by 8s. But how to define the perimeter here. Alternatively, maybe it's the opposite: the 1s that are surrounded by 9s on all four sides (up, down, left, right) are kept as 1, and others are turned into 8s. Wait, in Example 0's third row, the 1s are adjacent to 9s above and below. Let's see: for the first 1 in row 2 (assuming rows start at 0), it's at position (2,1). The cells around it: up is 9 (row 1, same column?), down is 9 (row 3, column 1). Wait, no. Let me think again. The input is given as a list of lists. Each list is a row. So in Example 0's input, the third row (index 2) is [9,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. The 1s here are in positions 1-3 and 7. The output changes the first three to 8s but leaves the 7th as 1. Let's check the neighboring cells of the 1 at position 7 in row 2 (original input). The row is [9,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. So the 1 at index 7 in row 2. Above it (row 1, same column) is 9. Below (row 3, column 7) is 9. To the left is 9 (index 6 in row 2), and to the right is 9 (index 8). So this 1 is surrounded by 9s except maybe in other directions. Wait, but in the original input, the 1 at row 2, column 7 is adjacent to 9s on left and right, but perhaps in other rows. Let me check the rows around it. Row 2's 1 at column 7: looking at row 3, column 7 is 1 (row 3 is [9,1,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9], so index 7 is 1). So below it is 1, not 9. So this 1 in row 2, column 7 has a 9 above (row 1), 1 below (row 3), 9 to the left (row 2, index 6), and 9 to the right (row 2, index 8). So the 1 in row 2, column 7 is adjacent to a 1 below. So maybe the rule is that 1s that are connected in a certain way (like part of a cross or longer line) are turned into 8s, while isolated 1s remain. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing 1s that are part of horizontal or vertical lines of exactly three. For example, three in a row horizontally or vertically. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input row 2 (third row), there are three consecutive 1s (positions 1-3). They become 8s. The 1 at position 7 is part of a vertical line. Let's check the rows above and below. Row 3's column 7 is 1. Row 4's column 7 is 9. Wait, row 4 is [9,1,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. So column 7 is 1. Then row 5's column 7 is 1 again. So in row 4, column 7, it's 1. So the vertical line in column 7 has 1s in rows 2,3,4,5? Let's check:\n\nRow 2, column 7: 1\nRow 3, column 7: 1\nRow 4, column 7: 1\nRow 5, column 7: 1\nRow 6, column 7: 1 (from row 6's input: [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9])\nSo that's a vertical line of 5 1s. But in the output, these are all kept as 1. So the vertical line of 5 1s remains, but the horizontal line of 3 1s in row 2 becomes 8s. So that contradicts the idea of vertical lines being replaced. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the 8s are replacing the perimeter of regions of 1s, and the inner 1s stay as 1. But looking at example 0's output, the 1s in the vertical line (column 7) are all 1s. So if they form a vertical line, maybe their perimeter is not being replaced. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing the 1s that are adjacent to a 9. Let's check. For instance, in Example 0's input row 2, the three 1s (positions 1-3) are surrounded by 9s on top and bottom (rows 1 and 3 have 9s in those columns) but adjacent to 9s on the left and right as well. Wait, in row 2, the three 1s are between 9s. So perhaps those 1s are on the edge of the 1s regions. But in the vertical line (column 7), the 1s are adjacent to 9s on the left and right but have 1s above and below. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing the 1s that form horizontal lines of three or more, while vertical lines remain as 1s. But in Example 1's input, there's a vertical line in the test input that becomes 8s. Wait, in Example 1's output, the first row is [9,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,1,9,9], which was a horizontal line of 5 1s. So they all became 8s. But in Example 0, the vertical line of 1s remained. So maybe horizontal lines are replaced, vertical are not. But that doesn't fit Example 3's output. Let's look at Example 3's input and output.\n\nIn Example 3's input, the second row is [9,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,1]. The output becomes [9,9,8,9,9,9,8,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,1]. So the 1s in positions 2 and 6 of this row are replaced by 8s. Why? Those 1s are not part of a horizontal line. Maybe they're part of a vertical line. Let's check the columns. For column 2 in this row, the input is 1. Let's check the rows above and below. The previous row (row 1) in input is [9,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1]. So column 2 here is 1. Then row 2 (current) column 2 is 1. So two in a row vertically. But in the output, row 2, column 2 is 8. Hmm, but in Example 0, a vertical line of 5 1s remains as 1s. So maybe vertical lines of certain lengths are replaced. This is getting confusing.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the 8s are replacing the 1s that are part of a cross shape, where a 1 has neighbors on both sides horizontally and vertically. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let's take a different angle. Let's compare the input and output in all examples and see what's common.\n\nLooking for instances where 1 becomes 8:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- All horizontal sequences of 3 or more 1s become 8s. The vertical sequences (like column 7) remain 1s.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\n- The first row's five 1s become 8s (horizontal).\n- In row 2, the first and fifth 1s become 8s (they are part of horizontal lines in their rows? Or maybe part of vertical lines? The fifth element in row 2's input is 1, which is part of the vertical line in column 5? Not sure. Wait, looking at the input of Example 1, perhaps there are horizontal lines and some vertical lines being replaced. For instance, in the test input of Example 1, the vertical line in column 3 (from rows 6-9) becomes 8s. Wait, in the test input's output, the row starting with [9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9] becomes [9,9,9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]. Then the next row is [9,9,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9] which becomes [9,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,...]. So that's a horizontal line of 5 1s turned into 8s. Then in the next row, [9,9,9,1,9,1,9,9,9,9,9] becomes [9,9,9,8,9,8,9,...], which suggests that isolated 1s are also turned into 8s. Wait, that contradicts the previous examples. So maybe the rule is that any 1 that is part of a horizontal or vertical line of three or more 1s is replaced by 8. Let's check this.\n\nIn Example 0's vertical line (column 7 has 5 consecutive 1s vertically). So if vertical lines of three or more are replaced, but in the output they remain as 1, then that's not the case. So maybe only horizontal lines are replaced. But then in Example 1's input, there's a vertical line in the test input that becomes 8s. Wait, let me look again. In Example 1's test input, the input has a vertical line of 1s in column 3, perhaps. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the input of Example 1:\n\nRow 6: [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\nRow 7: [9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9]\nRow 8: [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\nRow 9: [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1]\nRow 10: [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 1]\n\nIn row 6, column 3 is 1. Row 7 has 1s in columns 2-6. So in column 3, rows 7-9: row 7 has 1, row 8 has 1, row 9 has 1. That's three consecutive rows. So a vertical line of three 1s in column 3. In the output, these become 8s. So row 6's column 3 becomes 8 (as in output row 6: [9,9,9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]). Row 7's column 3 is part of a horizontal line, so also replaced. Row 8's column 3 is 1 in input, output is 8. So vertical line of three 1s is replaced. So vertical lines of three or more 1s are replaced by 8s. But then in Example 0's column 7, there are five 1s vertically. Why are they not replaced? Let's check Example 0's input:\n\nRow 2, column 7: 1\nRow 3, column 7: 1\nRow 4, column 7: 1 (input row 4: [9,1,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9])\nWait, no. Input row 4 is [9,1,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. So column 7 is 1. Then row 5, column 7 is 1. Row 6, column 7 is 1. So from row 2 to row 6, column 7 has 1s. That's five consecutive rows. So a vertical line of five 1s. But in the output, these remain as 1s. So that contradicts the idea that vertical lines of three or more are replaced. So maybe there's a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any 1 that is part of a horizontal line of three or more is replaced by 8, and any 1 that is part of a vertical line of three or more is replaced by 8. But in Example 0, the vertical line of five 1s is not replaced. So that can't be. So maybe there's another condition. Maybe the replacement only happens if the 1 is part of a horizontal line of three or more but not part of a vertical line of three or more. Or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing the 1s that are part of a \"cross\" shape, where a 1 has at least two consecutive 1s both horizontally and vertically. But this might not fit all cases.\n\nLet me try to find another approach. Perhaps the 8s are replacing 1s that form the outline of a square or rectangle. For example, in Example 0, the input has a pattern of 1s that could form an 'H' shape, and the output replaces the horizontal bars with 8s. But this is getting too vague.\n\nLooking at the test input might help. Let's look at the test input provided:\n\nTest Input:\n[1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1]\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1]\n[1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]\n[1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1]\n[1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 9]\n[9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9]\n[9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9]\n[9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9]\n\nSo, for example, in row 2 of the test input: [9,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. This is a horizontal line of five 1s. According to the pattern observed in training examples, these should be replaced by 8s. Similarly, row 5 has [9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,1], so the four 1s (indices 4-7) should become 8s. But row 3 has [9,9,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. The 1s at indices 4 and 7. Are these part of a vertical line? Let's see. In column 4, row 2 has 1, rows 3-5 have 1, so vertical line of four 1s. If vertical lines of three or more are replaced, these would become 8s. Similarly, column 7 in rows 2-5 has 1s. So vertical line of four 1s. So according to some previous examples, perhaps these vertical lines would become 8s.\n\nBut how to reconcile with the training examples where vertical lines were kept as 1s. For example, in Example 0's column 7. So why in that case the vertical line wasn't replaced? Maybe there's a different condition. Let me check Example 0's column 7 again. The input has:\n\nRow 2: 1 (col 7)\nRow 3: 1\nRow 4: 1\nRow 5: 1\nRow 6: 1\n\nSo a vertical line of five 1s. But in the output, they remain as 1s. So why weren't they replaced? What's different between this vertical line and the vertical lines in other examples that were replaced. Looking at Example 1's vertical line in column 3 (rows 6-9), which were replaced. So perhaps the rule is that vertical lines are replaced only if they are not part of a larger cross or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that 1s are replaced by 8s if they are part of a horizontal or vertical line of exactly three. But that doesn't fit Example 0's horizontal line of three 1s being replaced. But in Example 1's vertical line of three 1s (rows 6-8), they are replaced. But in Example 0's vertical line of five 1s, they are not replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement happens for horizontal lines of three or more and vertical lines of three or more, but only if they are isolated. For example, in Example 0's vertical line of five 1s, perhaps they are part of a larger structure (like a cross) and thus not replaced. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 8s are replacing the 1s that form horizontal or vertical lines, but only the first and last elements of the line are replaced. Or the middle elements. Or perhaps it's the opposite: the perimeter of a block of 1s is replaced with 8s. For example, in Example 0's horizontal line of three 1s, all are perimeter, so replaced. But in a vertical line, the top and bottom are replaced. But in Example 0's vertical line, none are replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing the 1s that are adjacent to a 9. So any 1 that has a 9 next to it (horizontally or vertically) is replaced. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's row 2, the three 1s are surrounded by 9s on the left, right, top, and bottom (since the rows above and below have 9s in those columns). So all three 1s are replaced by 8s. The 1 in column 7 of row 2 is adjacent to a 9 on the left and right, but below it in row 3 is another 1. So this 1 has a 9 to the left and right, but 1 below. So according to this rule, it's adjacent to 9s, so replaced. But in the output, it remains as 1. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s replace 1s that are part of a horizontal line but not part of a vertical line. But again, not sure.\n\nMaybe another approach: look for the positions where 1s are turned into 8s and see their neighbors. For example, in Example 0's row 2, the three 1s are surrounded by 9s except for each other. So each 1 has a 9 on top and bottom. So maybe the rule is that 1s are replaced by 8s if they are in a horizontal line and not connected vertically to other 1s. But that's not the case here, since row 3's column 1-3 are 9s. Wait, no: row 3's input is [9,1,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. So in row 3, columns 1 and 3 are 1s. So the middle 1 in row 2 (column 2) is above a 9 (row 3, column 2 is 9). So perhaps any 1 that is part of a horizontal line and has 9s above and below is replaced by 8. But then why are the vertical lines not replaced? For example, in Example 0's column 7, the 1s are part of a vertical line and are surrounded by 9s to the left and right. So maybe vertical lines surrounded by 9s on the sides are replaced. But in the output, they aren't. So this line of thinking isn't leading anywhere.\n\nLet me think again. Looking at all training examples, the output replaces certain 1s with 8s, but leaves others. The common pattern seems to be that 1s that form the horizontal parts of what looks like letters (like 'H' or 'A') are replaced by 8s, perhaps indicating that they are the horizontal strokes. For example, in Example 0, the input may form an 'H' shape where the horizontal bars are replaced by 8s, leaving the vertical bar as 1s. Similarly, in Example 1's input, the horizontal bars of letters are replaced. But this is speculative and requires assuming that the inputs are letters, which may not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace all 1s except those that are isolated or part of a vertical line. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3's input row 8: [1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9] which becomes [8,8,8,8,9,...]. So four 1s in a row horizontally are replaced. In the output, they become 8s. Then, in row 9 of the input: [1,9,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,1,9,9,9,9,9] becomes [8,9,9,8,9,9,9,1,9,1,9,...]. The 1s in positions 0 and 3 are replaced by 8s. Are these part of a horizontal line? They are separated by two 9s. So no. So why are they replaced? Maybe because they are part of a vertical line. Let's check column 0 in rows 8-10. Row 8:1, row 9:1, row 10:1. So a vertical line of three 1s. But in the output, row 8's 1 becomes 8, row 9's 1 becomes 8, row 10's 1 becomes 8. So vertical lines of three are replaced. But in Example 0's vertical line of five 1s, they are not replaced. So this is inconsistent.\n\nThis is really puzzling. Let me try to list all possible transformations and see which fits all examples.\n\nPossible transformations:\n\n1. Replace all 1s that are part of horizontal lines of 3 or more.\n2. Replace all 1s that are part of vertical lines of 3 or more.\n3. Replace all 1s that are part of horizontal or vertical lines of 3 or more.\n4. Replace all 1s except those that are part of vertical lines.\n5. Replace 1s that are part of horizontal lines of 3 or more, and vertical lines of 3 or more, but not both.\n\nTesting each possibility against the examples.\n\nOption 3: Replace if part of horizontal or vertical line of 3 or more.\n\nExample 0's horizontal line of 3: replaced. Vertical line of 5: should be replaced, but in output, they are not. So option 3 is invalid.\n\nOption 1: Replace horizontal lines of 3 or more.\n\nExample 0's vertical line is not replaced, which fits. Example 1's vertical line of 3 would not be replaced. But in Example 1's output, the vertical line in column 3 (rows 6-9) are replaced. So option 1 is invalid.\n\nOption 4: Replace all 1s except those in vertical lines. But in Example 0's horizontal line of 3, they are replaced, which fits. But vertical lines would remain. However, in Example 1's vertical line of 3, they are replaced. So this contradicts.\n\nOption 5: Replace if part of horizontal or vertical line of 3 or more, but not if part of both. For example, a cross shape where a 1 is part of both horizontal and vertical lines would not be replaced. But this is getting too specific.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s that are in horizontal lines of 3 or more, and vertical lines of exactly 2. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to replace 1s that are part of horizontal lines of any length (>=2?), but leave vertical lines. But in Example 1's output, vertical lines are replaced. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the test input, let's see what needs to be transformed.\n\nIn the test input, row 2 is [9,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. This is a horizontal line of 5 1s. According to training examples, these should become 8s. Similarly, row 5 has four 1s in a horizontal line. So they should become 8s. \n\nLooking at column 4 in the test input. Rows 2-5 have 1s. So vertical line of four 1s. If vertical lines are replaced, then these would become 8s.\n\nIn Example 0, the vertical line of five 1s remained as 1s. So why the difference? Maybe the vertical lines are replaced only if they are not adjacent to other 1s. Or maybe vertical lines are replaced only if they are part of certain structures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are replacing the 1s that form the outline of a rectangle, while inner 1s remain. But this requires more analysis.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is to replace every third 1 in a sequence. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are replacing the 1s that are the first and last in a horizontal or vertical line, leaving the middle ones as 1. But looking at Example 0's input, the three 1s in a row become three 8s. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that 9 is a background value and 1 is a foreground value. The transformation is to change certain 1s to 8 based on their connectivity. For example, if a 1 is part of a horizontal line but not part of a vertical line, it becomes 8. But this is too vague.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that any 1 that is part of a horizontal line of three or more, or part of a vertical line of three or more, is replaced by 8. However, in some cases, such as Example 0's vertical line, this isn't happening. Let's check why.\n\nIn Example 0's vertical line (column 7), the 1s are part of a vertical line of five. So according to this rule, they should be replaced. But in the output, they remain as 1. So why is that? Unless there's an exception when the vertical line is part of a cross or intersection.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical lines are not replaced, but horizontal lines are. But in Example 1, there are vertical lines that are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction of the line matters. For example, horizontal lines are replaced, but vertical lines are replaced only if they are of even length. But this is speculative.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Let me try to look for another pattern. All the training examples have outputs where 1s are replaced by 8s in certain positions, but the 9s remain unchanged. The key is to find what distinguishes the 1s that become 8s from those that remain.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput row 2: [9,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9] \u2192 Output: [9,8,8,8,9,9,9,1,9,9,9].\n\nThe first three 1s are replaced. They form a horizontal line. The last 1 in that row (position 7) remains. Now, looking at the surrounding cells of that 1 in position 7:\n\nIn the input, the 1 at position 7 in row 2 has a 1 below it in row 3, column 7. Then in row 4, column 7 is 1, row 5, column 7 is 1, etc. So this 1 is part of a vertical line. So maybe the rule is that 1s in horizontal lines are replaced unless they are also part of a vertical line. In this case, the 1s in the horizontal line are not part of a vertical line (since their vertical neighbors are 9s), so they are replaced. But the 1 in position 7 is part of a vertical line, so it remains.\n\nSo the rule could be: Replace any 1 that is part of a horizontal line of three or more, but only if they are not part of a vertical line of three or more. Similarly, replace vertical lines unless they are part of a horizontal line.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s that are part of a horizontal line but not connected vertically are replaced. But this requires checking neighboring cells.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but perhaps this is the right track. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 0's row 2, the three 1s are part of a horizontal line. Their vertical neighbors (row 1 and row 3) are 9s and 9/1 respectively. The first three 1s are not part of a vertical line, so they are replaced. The 1 in column 7 is part of a vertical line, so it remains.\n\nIn Example 1's first row, the five 1s form a horizontal line. Their vertical neighbors (row 0 and row 2) are 9s and 9/1. So they are replaced.\n\nIn Example 1's row 6, the 1 in column 3 is part of a vertical line of three. So according to the rule, vertical lines are replaced unless they are part of a horizontal line. But in the output, this 1 becomes 8. So perhaps vertical lines are replaced if they are of three or more, regardless of horizontal lines.\n\nBut in Example 0's vertical line of five, they are not replaced. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. Another possibility: maybe 1s are replaced by 8s if they are part of a horizontal line of three or more, and vertical lines are replaced only if they are of even length. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the possible patterns, I think the most consistent observation is that any 1 that is part of a horizontal line of three or more is replaced by 8, and any 1 that is part of a vertical line of three or more is also replaced by 8. This seems to fit most examples, except Example 0's vertical line. But perhaps in Example 0, the vertical line of five 1s is part of a larger structure that prevents them from being replaced. However, I can't see why.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line in Example 0 is not replaced because they are part of a cross with horizontal lines. But looking at the input, the vertical line in column 7 is part of horizontal lines in rows 4 and 5. For example, in row 4: [9,1,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. There's a 1 in column 7, but no horizontal line there. Row 5: [9,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. Again, horizontal line in columns 1-3. The vertical line in column 7 is not part of a horizontal line. So why are they not replaced?\n\nThis is really confusing. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the hypothesis that the pattern is to replace all 1s that are part of horizontal or vertical lines of three or more, and apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow 2: horizontal line of five 1s \u2192 replaced by 8s.\nRow 3: vertical line in column 7 (rows 2-5) \u2192 four 1s. So replaced.\nRow 5: horizontal line of four 1s \u2192 replaced.\nRow 6: column 7 has 1s vertically (rows 6-7) \u2192 two 1s. Not replaced.\nRow 7: horizontal line of four 1s (columns 0-3) \u2192 replaced.\nRow 12: horizontal line of six 1s \u2192 replaced.\nRow 13-15: vertical line in column 3 \u2192 rows 12-15 have 1s. Let's see:\n\nRow 12: 1,1,1,1,1,1 (columns 3-8)\nRow 13: 1 in column 3\nRow 14: 1 in column 3\nRow 15: 1 in column 3\nSo vertical line from row 12 to row 15, column 3: four 1s. So replaced.\n\nApplying this to each row:\n\nTest Input's row 0: [1,1,9,...] \u2192 two 1s horizontally. Not replaced.\nRow 1: [9,...,1,9...] \u2192 single 1. Not replaced.\nRow 2: [9,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,9...] \u2192 horizontal line of 5 \u2192 replaced by 8s.\nRow 3: [9,9,9,9,1,9,9,1,...] \u2192 column 4 has 1 (part of vertical line from row2-5) \u2192 replaced.\nRow 4: [9,9,9,9,1,9,9,1,...] \u2192 same as row3.\nRow 5: [9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,...] \u2192 horizontal line of 4 \u2192 replaced.\nRow6: [9,9,9,9,...,1,1,1,1] \u2192 column 7 has 1 (part of vertical line from row6-7? Let's see: row6's column7 is 1, row7's column7 is 1. Only two, so not replaced.\nRow7: [1,1,1,1,9...,1,9...] \u2192 horizontal line of four 1s \u2192 replaced.\nRow8: [1,9,9,1,...] \u2192 two 1s in columns 0 and 3. Not part of lines of three \u2192 replaced? Wait, row8's input is [1,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1]. The 1s are at positions 0, 3, and 14. The 1 at 0 is part of a vertical line in column0 (rows7-9: rows7 has 1, row8 has 1, row9 has 1, row10 has 1). So vertical line of four. So replaced.\nRow9: [1,9,9,1,...] \u2192 1s at 0,3,13,14. Column0 has 1s in rows7-10. So replaced.\nRow10: [1,1,9...] \u2192 1s at 0 and1. Vertical line in column0 (rows7-10) \u2192 four 1s \u2192 replaced.\nRow12: [9,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,9...] \u2192 horizontal line of six \u2192 replaced.\nRow13: [9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,1...] \u2192 vertical line in column3 (rows12-15) \u2192 replaced.\nRow14: same as row13 \u2192 replaced.\nRow15: [9,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9...] \u2192 horizontal line of seven \u2192 replaced.\n\nSo applying this, the test input's 1s that are part of horizontal or vertical lines of three or more become 8s. Others remain 1s.\n\nNow, let's construct the output for the test input based on this rule.\n\nFor example, row2 in the test input becomes [9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,1,9,9,9].\n\nRow3: [9,9,9,9,8,9,9,8,9,9,9,1,9,9,9] \u2192 since the 1s in column4 and7 are part of vertical lines.\n\nRow5: [9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,1,9,9,1] \u2192 horizontal line of four 1s.\n\nRow7: [8,8,8,8,9,9,9,8,9,9,9,1,9,9,1] \u2192 horizontal line of four 1s.\n\nRow8: [8,9,9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8] \u2192 vertical line in column0 and3.\n\nRow12: [9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,1,1,9].\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems to align with the training examples. For instance, Example 3's input row8 has four 1s in a horizontal line, replaced by 8s. \n\nTherefore, the pattern is to replace all 1s that are part of a horizontal or vertical line of three or more consecutive 1s with 8s. Let's apply this to the test input.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples. Then apply that to the test input. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a lot of 9s and some 1s. The output replaces some of the 1s with 8s, but not all. Looking at the structure, maybe the 1s that form a certain shape are being changed. For instance, in the third row of the input, there's [9, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], and the output becomes [9, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9]. So the first three 1s turned into 8s, but the 1 in the 7th position stayed. Hmm, maybe it's about the position or connectivity of the 1s. Maybe contiguous blocks of 1s are being converted to 8s if they form a certain pattern, like a cross or a square?\n\nWait, looking at another part of Example 0. The fourth row input is [9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], output [9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9]. So the 1s in positions 1 and 3 are turned into 8s, but the 1 in position 7 remains. Maybe the 1s that are part of a horizontal line are being changed? But in row 5 of input, there's [9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9], output [9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9]. Here, the first two 1s are turned to 8s, but the last four 1s are left as 1. So maybe it's not just horizontal lines. Alternatively, perhaps the 8s are replacing 1s that are part of certain structures, like letters or numbers.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input's first row after the 9s is [9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9], and the output changes those 1s to 8s. Then in the third row of input, [9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1], the first five 1s become 8s, but the last three remain 1s. Wait, but in the output, those last three 1s are still 1. Hmm. So maybe the transformation is only applied to certain regions. Perhaps regions of 1s that are connected in a certain way, like forming the outline of a shape, and the inner parts remain 1? Or maybe the 8s are replacing the perimeter of the 1s, and the inner 1s stay. Let me check that.\n\nIn Example 0, the input's third row has three 1s in a row, all turned to 8s. If they were the perimeter, but that's just a horizontal line. Maybe it's that all 1s except those that are part of the number 1 (like in a digital display) are replaced. Wait, maybe 8 is used to represent the 'filled' version of the digit, and 1 is for something else. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing the 1s that form a closed loop, like the number 8. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples, perhaps any contiguous block of 1s that form a certain shape (like a letter) are replaced by 8s. For example, in Example 0, the pattern of 1s could form the letter E, and those are replaced by 8s. Let me visualize the input of Example 0's third row: [9, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9]. The first three 1s are horizontal. Then in the next row, [9, 1, 9, 1, 9, ...], which is like two vertical 1s with a 9 in between. Then the next row [9, 1, 9, 1, 9, ...] same. Then a row with four 1s in a horizontal line. This looks like the letter E, and those 1s are replaced by 8s, while the single 1 in the seventh position (maybe part of a different structure) remains 1. So maybe the transformation is replacing all 1s that form a certain character (like letters) with 8s, leaving other 1s as is.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a row [9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, ...], which might form a horizontal line (like the top of an F or E), and those are replaced by 8s. Then another row with [9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9...], which could form the vertical lines of a letter, replaced by 8s. Then the next row [9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9...] again horizontal. So maybe each letter is being converted to 8s. For example, in Example 1, the first three rows might form the letter F, converted to 8s. Then later in the input, there's a single 1 in a row which becomes 8, perhaps part of another letter.\n\nWait, but in the output of Example 1, the last row of input is [1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1], and the output is [1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8]. So the 1s at the end are replaced by 8s. Hmm, perhaps the transformation is to replace all 1s that are part of a group forming a certain minimum size or shape. Maybe all contiguous regions of 1s that form a certain size (like 3 or more) are converted to 8s. But in Example 0, there's a single 1 in the seventh position that remains, but other 1s in a group are replaced. In Example 1, the single 1s in some rows remain, while groups are replaced. Wait, looking at Example 1's input:\n\nIn the first row, five 1s in a row (converted to 8s). In the third row, five 1s again. In row 7, there's a row with [9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9...], which becomes 8s. So maybe any horizontal line of three or more 1s is converted to 8s. But in Example 0, the horizontal three 1s are converted. However, in the same example, in the fifth row, [9, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9...], the three 1s are converted. But then in the fifth row of Example 0's input, there's a part with 1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,1. Wait, maybe it's more about the letters. The E-shaped 1s are replaced by 8s, which could represent a different digit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in each input, certain 1s are part of the number 1 (as in the digit), and others are part of other digits (like 8), so the 8s are replacing the 1s that form the outline of a different digit. But how to determine which is which.\n\nLooking at the outputs, in all examples, 1s that are in groups forming a closed loop or a certain structure are replaced by 8s. For instance, in Example 3's input, the first row after the 9s has seven 1s in a row, which become 8s. Then in the third row, [9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 9, 1, ...] becomes 8s. So perhaps the 1s that form a contiguous block (like a solid rectangle) are being replaced by 8s. Or maybe 1s that are part of a loop are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the positions where 1s are replaced by 8s: in Example 0, the first three 1s in the third row are replaced. The structure looks like the top bar of a digit. Then in the next rows, the vertical 1s are replaced. So perhaps it's about converting the 1s that form the segments of a seven-segment display. For example, the digit 8 in a seven-segment display uses all seven segments. So if the 1s form a digit (like the letter E or F, which could be 8 in some context), then those 1s are replaced by 8s. But how to know which digits are being represented.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are part of the number 1 (as in the digit) and are left as 1, while other 1s (part of other digits) are replaced by 8. For example, if the 1s form a vertical line (like the digit 1), they stay. But if they form other shapes (like the horizontal or other parts of digits), they become 8. But looking at Example 0, the vertical 1s in rows 3 and 4 are replaced by 8s. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output of each example pixel by pixel. Let's take Example 0. The input's third row is [9,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. The output is [9,8,8,8,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. The 1s in positions 1-3 are replaced by 8, but the 1 in position 7 remains. Looking at adjacent rows, maybe the 1s that are part of a horizontal line are replaced. But then in row 4 of input: [9,1,9,1,9,9,9,1,9...], output [9,8,9,8,9,9,9,1...]. So the 1s are in positions 1 and 3, which are vertical. So maybe it's not just horizontal.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that all 1s that are part of a contiguous region (connected either horizontally or vertically) that's part of a larger structure. For example, in Example 0, the E-shaped 1s form a contiguous region. But why are the vertical 1s in row 4 also replaced? Because they are part of the same structure. So perhaps any contiguous region of 1s that forms a certain shape (like a letter) is replaced with 8s. But then, in the test input, there are lines of 1s that might form letters. So the task is to find which 1s are part of such structures and replace them with 8s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that all 1s that are part of a cross (like a plus sign) are replaced. But how to verify that.\n\nAnother angle: in the outputs, the 8s often form the outline of a shape. For example, in Example 0's output, the E is formed with 8s, and the single 1 in the seventh column might be part of a different structure. But how to determine which 1s are changed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are replacing the 1s that are on the perimeter of a group, while the inner 1s remain as 1. Let's check that. In Example 0's third row, the three 1s in a row are all changed to 8s. If that's the perimeter, but they are a straight line; maybe they are the entire group, so all are perimeter. But then in the fifth row of Example 0's input, there's a group of four 1s in a row. In the output, they are still 1s. Wait, no, looking at Example 0's input row 5: [9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9]. Output row 5: [9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9]. Wait, the first two 1s (positions 1 and 3) are changed to 8s, but the last four 1s (positions 6-9) remain as 1s. So that contradicts the perimeter idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the 1s that are adjacent (even diagonally) to a 9. But in Example 0's third row, all three 1s are adjacent to 9s. But then in the fifth row, the 1s in positions 6-9 are adjacent to 9s as well, but they remain 1s. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the 1s that are connected in a way that forms a certain number of adjacent cells. Like, if a group of 1s has a certain size or shape, they are replaced. For example, groups larger than a certain size. Let's see: in Example 0, the E-shaped group has 7 or more 1s, maybe. So those are replaced. The single 1 in position 7 is left. But how about in Example 1, there's a single 1 in the output that remains as 1. So perhaps the rule is that any group of 1s that is not a single vertical line (like the digit 1) is replaced by 8s. So the digit 1 would be a single column of 1s, and other groups are 8s.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input row 2: [9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 1]. Output: [9,8,9,9,9,8,9,9,1,9,1]. So the 1 in position 5 is replaced by 8, but the 1 in position 8 and 10 remain. Maybe because the 1 in position 5 is part of a larger group, but the others are isolated. Wait, but the 1 in position 8 is part of a group in row 3: [9,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,1,1,1]. So in row 3, all the 1s except the last three are replaced. So perhaps groups that are connected horizontally or vertically and form a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 1 that is part of a horizontal line of three or more is replaced with 8. In Example 0's third row, three 1s in a row are replaced. In Example 1's first row, five 1s in a row. In Example 3's first row, seven 1s. So that's possible. But then in Example 0's fourth row, the 1s are in positions 1 and 3, which are vertical but not part of a horizontal line. So they are replaced, which would contradict that idea.\n\nHmm, maybe it's both horizontal and vertical lines. For example, any line of three or more 1s either horizontally or vertically. Let's check Example 0. In row 3, three horizontal 1s \u2192 replaced. In row 4, vertical 1s (positions 1 and 3). Wait, but there's only two 1s in a vertical line. So that would not fit. Unless the vertical line is two or more.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s that form part of a square or rectangle. But how?\n\nAnother approach: notice that in the outputs, the 1s that remain are often part of vertical lines. For example, in Example 0's seventh column, the 1 is part of a vertical line. Looking at the input:\n\nRow 2: 9s and a single 1 in column 7.\n\nRow 3: 9s and a single 1 in column 7.\n\nRow 4: 9s and a single 1 in column 7.\n\nRow 5: 9s and four 1s in columns 7-10 (horizontal line).\n\nRow 6: 9s and a single 1 in column 7.\n\nSo in the output, the vertical line in column 7 (rows 2-6) remains as 1s, except for row 5 where there's a horizontal line. Wait, no. In row 5's output, the 1s in columns 7-10 are still 1s. So perhaps that vertical line is preserved as 1s, and the other 1s (horizontal) are replaced by 8s. So the vertical single column of 1s (like a digit 1) stays, and other groups are replaced.\n\nSo the pattern is: 1s that form a vertical line (like the digit 1) remain 1, and all other 1s are replaced with 8s. Let's check this against the examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the vertical line of 1s in column 7 (rows 2-6) remains as 1. The horizontal lines and other parts are replaced by 8s. That fits.\n\nIn Example 1's input, looking at the last few rows:\n\nThe row [1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1] becomes [1,1,9..., 8,8,8]. Wait, but according to the hypothesis, vertical lines remain 1. But here, three 1s at the end are replaced by 8s. So maybe the vertical line is only when they are a single column. If the 1s are in a single column, then they remain. If they are in multiple columns, they are replaced.\n\nBut in Example 0, the vertical line is a single column. So for example, in Example 1, the input's row 7 is [9,9,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9]. Output is [9,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,...]. So those 1s form a horizontal line, replaced by 8s. However, the row [9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9] in input becomes [9,9,9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]. So a single 1 is replaced by 8, which contradicts the previous idea.\n\nWait, but in that case, the single 1 is not part of a vertical line. So maybe the vertical line needs to be multiple rows in the same column. Like a vertical line of 1s spanning multiple rows. For example, if in column x, multiple rows have 1s consecutively, then they form the digit 1 and are kept as 1s. Other 1s are replaced by 8s.\n\nIn Example 0, the vertical line in column 7 (rows 2-6) is kept as 1s. The other 1s (horizontal lines) are replaced by 8s.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's row 10 is [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,9,8], which suggests that the 1 in column 9 and 11 (originally in input row 10) are replaced by 8s, but there's a vertical line somewhere else. For instance, in the test input, maybe there's a vertical line of 1s in a column that's preserved.\n\nIn Example 3's input, there's a row with [9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9], which in output becomes [9,9,9,9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]. So a single 1 replaced by 8. So that's not a vertical line. So maybe the rule is more complex.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the 1s that are part of the number 1 (as in the digit) are left as 1, and all other 1s are converted to 8. The digit 1 is represented by a vertical line of 1s, possibly with a small horizontal line at the top. But in that case, how to distinguish between a vertical line that's part of a digit 1 versus other vertical lines.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s that form a vertical line of at least two 1s are kept as 1, and others are replaced. For example, in Example 0's column 7, there are multiple 1s vertically, so they are kept. But in Example 1's row 7, the five 1s in a row are replaced. In Example 3, the single 1 is replaced, but vertical lines (like in the last row of input) might remain.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input row 13: [9,9,9,9,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,9]. Output: [9,9,9,9,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,9]. So the 1s here are two in a row, but they are kept as 1s. Wait, no. The output for row 13 in Example 3 is [9,9,9,9,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,9]. The input was [9,9,9,9,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,9]. So no change. So why weren't these 1s replaced? Maybe because they are part of a vertical line? Let's see. The input row 13 has 1s in positions 5 and 6. If in the rows above, there's a vertical line in those columns. Let me check:\n\nExample 3's input:\n\nRow 13: [9,9,9,9,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,9]\n\nRow 14: Not provided, but maybe in the output, those 1s are kept. So perhaps the 1s that are part of a vertical line (even if two adjacent in a row) are kept. Wait, but two adjacent 1s horizontally would form a horizontal line, which according to previous examples would be replaced. Hmm, but in Example 3's row 13, those 1s are not replaced. That complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s that are connected in a way that forms a cross shape (like a plus sign) are replaced. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In the outputs, whenever a group of 1s forms a solid rectangle or a block that's not a vertical line, they are replaced by 8s. For example, in Example 0, the E-shaped 1s (which form a sort of rectangle with gaps) are replaced by 8s, but the vertical line of 1s remains. So maybe the rule is: any 1 that is part of a horizontal or more complex shape is replaced by 8, while vertical lines (like the digit 1) remain as 1.\n\nSo the test input: I need to look for vertical lines of 1s (single column, multiple rows) and leave them as 1s, replacing all other 1s with 8s.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nFirst row: [1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]. Two 1s in a row. These are horizontal, so replaced by 8s.\n\nSecond row: all 9s except position 12 (1). Single 1, part of a vertical line? Let's see other rows.\n\nThird row: [9,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. Five 1s in a row. So replaced by 8s.\n\nFourth row: [9,9,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. 1s in positions 4,7,11. Let's see if any of these form vertical lines. Position 4: maybe in other rows. Let's check other rows.\n\nFifth row: [9,9,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. Same as fourth row's structure. So positions 4,7,11 have 1s. Are there vertical lines?\n\nSixth row: [9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,1]. 1s in positions 4-7 (four in a row), 11, and 15. So positions 4-7 are horizontal.\n\nSeventh row: [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,1,1,1,1]. 1s in position 7, 11-14. So vertical line in column 7? Let's see: in previous rows (4-6), there's a 1 in column 7. For example, row 4: column 7 is 1. Row 5: column 7 is 1. Row 6: column 7 is 1 (since positions 4-7 are 1s). So column 7 has 1s in rows 4,5,6,7. That's a vertical line of four 1s. So according to the pattern, these should remain as 1s. But the 1s in column 7 in rows 4,5,6 are part of horizontal lines (row 6: 1s from 4-7), so they are replaced. Wait, but if the vertical line is preserved, then even if they are part of a horizontal line, they should stay as 1s. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical lines must be single-column. So if in column x, multiple rows have 1s in that column, then those 1s remain. For example, column 7 in the test input has 1s in rows 4,5,6,7. But in rows 4 and 5, the 1 in column 7 is part of a horizontal line (row 4: column 7 is 1, but row 4's 1s are at 4,7,11). So maybe the vertical line in column 7 is preserved, and the horizontal parts are replaced.\n\nBut according to the previous examples, if a 1 is part of a vertical line and a horizontal line, like in Example 0's row 5, the horizontal line is replaced, but the vertical line is kept. Wait, in Example 0's row 5 input: [9,1,9,1,9,9,1,1,1,1,9]. The output is [9,8,9,8,9,9,1,1,1,1,9]. So the 1s in columns 1 and 3 (part of vertical lines) are replaced, but the 1s in columns 6-9 (horizontal) are kept. That contradicts the idea.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let's look at which 1s are changed. In Example 0, the output has 8s where the 1s formed a certain pattern, perhaps the letter 'E'. The vertical line in column 7 is left as 1s. So perhaps the 1s that form letters (like E, F, etc.) are replaced by 8s, and any 1s that are part of the digit 1 (vertical line) remain. But how to recognize which 1s form letters.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that 1s that are part of a continuous region (connected by edges) of at least two cells are replaced by 8s, and single isolated 1s remain. But in Example 0's row 3, there are three 1s (a continuous region), replaced by 8s. The single 1 in column 7 remains. But in Example 1's input row 2, the 1 in position 5 is part of a larger group and is replaced. So that could fit. But in Example 0's row 5, there are four 1s in a row (continuous region), but they are left as 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to look for commonalities in the training examples.\n\nIn all training examples, the transformation replaces certain 1s with 8s. The remaining 1s are often in vertical lines. For example, in Example 0, the vertical line in column 7 remains. In Example 1, the vertical line in column 9 remains as 1s. In Example 3, some vertical lines remain. So the pattern might be that vertical lines of 1s (like the digit 1) are kept, and other 1s are replaced with 8s.\n\nSo the rule would be: any 1 that is part of a vertical line (i.e., in the same column in consecutive rows) is kept as 1; all other 1s are replaced with 8.\n\nNow, check this against the examples.\n\nExample 0:\n\n- The vertical line in column 7 (rows 2-6) is kept as 1s.\n- All other 1s (part of horizontal lines, etc.) are replaced with 8s. This matches the output.\n\nExample 1:\n\n- In the third row, the 1s in columns 1-5 (horizontal) are replaced with 8s.\n- The vertical line in column 9 (rows 2-3) has 1s. Let's see input rows:\nRow 2: [9,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,1,9,9]\nRow 3: [9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,1]\nSo in column 9, row 2 has 1, row 3 has 1. So a vertical line of two 1s. In the output, row 2's column 9 is 1, row 3's column 9 is 1. So they are kept. Then in row 3 of input, the 1s in columns 1-5 are replaced.\n\nExample 2:\n\nLooking at the output, the 1s that are kept are in vertical lines. For example, in row 8 of input: [9,1,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,9,9,9]. Output: [9,1,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,9,9,9]. So the vertical line of 1s in column 2 (rows 8-10) is kept. Wait, but in the input, row 8: [9,1,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,9,9,9]. Output: [9,1,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,9,9,9]. So the 1 in row 8, column 2 remains. But the vertical line here is a single 1. Hmm, that contradicts the previous idea. Unless there's another row where column 2 has a 1. Looking at input row 9: [1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. Column 2 has 1. So rows 8 and 9 have 1s in column 2. So a vertical line of two 1s. So in the output, they remain as 1s. Yes.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that any 1s that are part of a vertical line (same column in consecutive rows) are left as 1s, and all other 1s are replaced with 8s.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis against Example 3's input and output.\n\nIn Example 3's input row 10: [1,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9]. Output: [8,8,8,8,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9]. Wait, the first four 1s are replaced by 8s, but the 1s in columns 8-12 (positions 7-11) remain. Are these part of a vertical line? Let's look at the input rows:\n\nRow 9: [1,9,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,1,9,9,9,9,9]. Output: [8,9,9,8,9,9,9,1,9,1,9,9,9,9,9]. So column 8 has a 1 in row 9 (input) which is replaced by 8. But in row 10's input, columns 8-12 have 1s. So row 10's input columns 8-12 (positions 7-11) are 1,1,1,1,1. So those are horizontal. But in the output, they are replaced by 8s. Wait, but the output for row 10 is [8,8,8,8,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9]. So the 1s in columns 8-12 (output) are 1s. So according to this, they are kept as 1s, which would mean they are part of vertical lines. But looking at other rows:\n\nRow 11: [1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9]. Output: [8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9]. So row 11's column 10 has 1. So in rows 9-11, column 10: row 9 has 1, row 10 has 1, row 11 has 1. So a vertical line of three 1s. So they are kept as 1s. Similarly, columns 8 and 9 may have vertical lines. \n\nSo the vertical lines in columns 8-12 (positions 7-11) in rows 9-11 are preserved as 1s. So the hypothesis holds: vertical lines are kept, others replaced.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's process each row and column, checking for vertical lines.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]. Two 1s in columns 0 and 1. Are these part of vertical lines? Let's check rows below. Row 1: [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. Column 0 and 1 are 9 and 9. So no vertical line. So these two 1s are replaced by 8s.\n\nRow 1: [9,...,9,1,9,9,9]. Column 11. Check if there's a vertical line. Row 2: [9,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. Column 11 has 1. Row 1's column 11 has 1. So row 1 and 2 have 1 in column 11. Check row 3: [9,9,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. Column 11 is 1. So rows 1-3 have 1 in column 11. Then row 4: [9,9,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. Column 11 is 1. So rows 1-4 have 1 in column 11. Row 5: [9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,1]. Column 11 is 1. Row 6: [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,1,1,1,1]. Column 11 is 1. Row 7: [1,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,1]. Column 11 is 1. Row 8: [1,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1]. Column 11 is 9. So rows 1-7 have 1 in column 11. So a vertical line of 7 1s. Therefore, all these 1s in column 11 are preserved as 1s. The other 1s in rows 0-7 are replaced by 8s.\n\nRow 2: [9,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. Columns 3-7 are 1s. These are horizontal. But column 11's 1 is part of a vertical line. So columns 3-7 1s are replaced by 8s, column 11 remains 1.\n\nRow 3: [9,9,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]. Columns 4,7,11 have 1s. Columns 4 and 7 are not part of vertical lines (check rows above and below). For column 4: row 2 has 1, row 3 has 1. Let's check row 4: column 4 is 1. So rows 2-4 have 1 in column 4. So vertical line. Therefore, these 1s are preserved. Wait, but according to the hypothesis, vertical lines are preserved. So columns 4 has 1 in rows 2-5, so preserved. Similarly, column 7: rows 3,4,5,6,7 have 1s. So vertical line. So column 7's 1s are preserved.\n\nThis complicates things. So the vertical lines in columns 4 and 7 would be preserved, and their 1s would remain. But according to the training examples, in Example 0, a vertical line was preserved. So in this case, the vertical lines in columns 4,7,11 would have their 1s preserved, and others replaced.\n\nWait, but in the test input's row 3, columns 4,7,11 are 1s. If column 4 has 1s in consecutive rows, that's a vertical line, so preserved. Similarly for column 7. So in row 3, all three 1s (columns 4,7,11) are part of vertical lines and thus remain 1. But according to the training examples, this is not the case. For example, in Example 1's input row 3, there are 1s in columns 1-5 (horizontal), but the vertical line in column 9 is preserved. So the vertical line in column 9 is kept, others are replaced.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\n- For each 1 in the input, check if there's at least one other 1 in the same column in the row above or below. If yes, then it's part of a vertical line and remains 1. Otherwise, replace with 8.\n\nBut how to handle this for the first and last rows? For example, if a 1 is in the top row and has a 1 in the row below, it's part of a vertical line. Similarly for the bottom row.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input.\n\nRow 0: [1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]\n\nCheck each 1 (columns 0 and 1):\n\nFor column 0, check if row 1 has a 1. Row 1's column 0 is 9. No. So this 1 is isolated vertically. Replace with 8.\n\nFor column 1, check row 1's column 1 is 9. No. Replace with 8. So row 0's output: [8,8,9,...].\n\nRow 1: [9,...,9,1,9,9,9] (column 11). Check row 0's column 11 is 9, row 2's column 11 is 1. So yes, has a 1 below. So column 11's 1 is part of a vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nRow 2: [9,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]\n\nCheck columns 3-7 (1s). For each:\n\nColumn 3: check row 1's column 3 is 9, row 3's column 3 is 9. No. So replace with 8.\n\nColumn 4: row 1's column 4 is 9, row 3's column 4 is 1. So yes, has a 1 below. So remains 1.\n\nColumns 5-7:\n\nColumn 5: row 3's column 5 is 9. No. Replace.\n\nColumn 6: row 3's column 6 is 9. Replace.\n\nColumn 7: row 3's column 7 is 1. So yes. Remains 1.\n\nColumn 11: part of vertical line. Remains 1.\n\nSo row 2's output: [9,9,9,8,1,8,8,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]\n\nBut wait, columns 3-7:\n\n- Column 3: no vertical neighbors \u2192 8.\n- Column 4: yes \u2192 1.\n- Column 5: no \u2192 8.\n- Column 6: no \u21928.\n- Column 7: yes \u21921.\n\nSo row 2 becomes [9,9,9,8,1,8,8,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9].\n\nRow 3: [9,9,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9]\n\nCheck each 1:\n\nColumn 4: check row 2's column 4 is 1 (yes), row 4's column 4 is 1. So part of vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nColumn 7: row 2's column 7 is 1, row 4's column 7 is 1. So part of vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nColumn 11: part of vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nSo row 3's output: [9,9,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9].\n\nRow 4: same as row 3. All 1s are part of vertical lines. So output same.\n\nRow 5: [9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,1]\n\nCheck columns 4-7 and 11,15.\n\nColumns 4-7:\n\nColumn 4: row 5's column 4 is 1. Check row 4's column 4 (1) and row 6's column 4 (9). So yes, vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nColumn 5: check row 4's column 5 is 9, row 6's column 5 is 9. No. Replace with 8.\n\nColumn 6: same as column 5. Replace with 8.\n\nColumn 7: row 6's column 7 is 1. So yes. Remain 1.\n\nColumn 11: part of vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nColumn 15: check row 4's column 15 (9), row 6's column 15 (1). So if row 6 has a 1 in column 15, then yes. Let's check row 6: [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,1,1,1,1]. Column 15 is 1. So row 5's column 15 (1) and row 6's column 15 (1) form a vertical line. So column 15's 1 in row 5 is part of vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nSo row 5's output: [9,9,9,9,1,8,8,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,1].\n\nRow 6: [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,1,1,1,1]\n\nCheck column 7: row 5's 1 and row 7's column 7 (1). So vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nColumn 11: part of vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nColumns 12-14: 1s. Check vertical neighbors.\n\nRow 5's columns 12-14: 9,9,1. No. Row 7's columns 12-14: 9,9,1. So columns 12-14 in row 6: check if there are 1s above or below. For column 12: row 5's 9, row 7's 9. No \u2192 replaced. Similarly columns 13-14: only row 6 has 1s. So replaced.\n\nSo row 6's output: [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,1,8,8,8].\n\nRow 7: [1,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,1]\n\nColumns 0-3: 1s. Check vertical neighbors.\n\nRow 6's columns 0-3: 9s. Row 8's columns 0-3: [1,9,9,1]. So column 0: row 7's 1 and row 8's 1. So vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nColumn 1: row 8's column 1 is 9. So row 7's column 1: check row 6 (9) and row 8 (9). No. Replace with 8.\n\nSimilarly, columns 2 and 3:\n\nColumn 2: row 8's column 2 is 9 \u2192 replaced.\n\nColumn 3: row 8's column 3 is 1. So vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nColumn 7: part of vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nColumn 11: vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nColumn 15: row 6's column 15 is 1, row 8's column 15 is 1. So vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nSo row 7's output: [1,8,8,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,1,9,9,1].\n\nRow 8: [1,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1]\n\nCheck columns 0,3,15.\n\nColumn 0: row 7's 1, row 9's 1. So vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nColumn 3: row 7's 1, row 9's 1. So vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nColumn 15: row 7's 1, row 9's 1. So vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nOther columns: no 1s.\n\nRow 8's output: [1,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1].\n\nRow 9: [1,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1]\n\nColumns 0,3,13,14.\n\nCheck vertical neighbors:\n\nColumn 0: row 8's 1, row 10's 1. Vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nColumn 3: row 8's 1, row 10's 9. No. So column 3's 1 in row 9 has row 8's 1 and row 10's 9. So vertical line (since row 8 has 1, row 9 has 1). So vertical line remains.\n\nColumn 13: row 8's 9, row 10's 9. No. Replace with 8.\n\nColumn 14: row 8's 1, row 10's 9. No. Replace with 8.\n\nSo row 9's output: [1,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8].\n\nRow 10: [1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]\n\nColumns 0 and 1: 1s.\n\nCheck vertical neighbors:\n\nColumn 0: row 9's 1, row 11's 9. So vertical line (rows 8-10). Remain 1.\n\nColumn 1: row 9's 9, row 11's 9. No. Replace with 8.\n\nSo row 10's output: [1,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9].\n\nRow 11: [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]. All 9s. Output remains.\n\nRow 12: [9,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,1,9]\n\nCheck columns 3-8 (1s) and 12-13 (1s).\n\nFor each 1 in columns 3-8:\n\nCheck vertical neighbors. Let's look at rows 11 and 13.\n\nRow 11: all 9s. Row 13: [9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,1,9]. So column 3 in row 12 has 1. Row 13's column 3 is 1. So vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nSimilarly, columns 4-8:\n\nRow 12's columns 4-8 are all 1s. Check row 13's columns:\n\nRow 13's column 4 is 9, 5-8 are 9. So columns 4-8: no vertical line. So replaced.\n\nColumns 12-13 (1s in row 12): check row 11 (9s) and row 13 (columns 12-13 are 9 and 1). So column 12: no, replaced. Column 13: row 13's column 13 is 1. So vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nSo row 12's output: [9,9,9,1,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,8,1,9].\n\nRow 13: [9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,1,9]\n\nColumns 3,8,14.\n\nCheck vertical line:\n\nColumn 3: row 12's 1, row 14's column 3 is 1. So vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nColumn 8: row 12's 1, row 14's column 8 is 9. So vertical line only in row 12-13. Remain 1.\n\nColumn 14: row 12's 9, row 14's 9. No. Replace with 8.\n\nSo row 13's output: [9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,1,8].\n\nRow 14: [9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,1,9]\n\nColumns 3,8,14.\n\nCheck vertical line:\n\nColumn 3: row 13's 1, row 15's column 3 is 1. So vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nColumn 8: row 13's 1, row 15's column 8 is 1. So vertical line. Remain 1.\n\nColumn 14: row 13's 8, row 15's column 14. Row 15's input: [9,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9]. Column 14 is 9. So no vertical line. Replace with 8.\n\nRow 14's output: [9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,8,8].\n\nRow 15: [9,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,1,9]\n\nCheck columns 3-9 (1s) and column 13.\n\nFor columns 3-9:\n\nCheck vertical neighbors:\n\nRow 14's column 3 is 1, row 16 (none). So column 3's 1 in row 15 is part of vertical line (row 14 and 15). Remain 1.\n\nColumns 4-9: check rows 14's columns 4-9 (9s). So no vertical line. Replace with 8.\n\nColumn 13: row 14's 8, no. Replace with 8.\n\nSo row 15's output: [9,9,9,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,8,9].\n\nPutting all this together, the output would be:\n\n[8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9]\n\n[9, 9, 9, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9]\n\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9]\n\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9]\n\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 8, 8, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1]\n\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 8, 8, 8]\n\n[1, 8, 8, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1]\n\n[1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]\n\n[1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8]\n\n[1, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n\n[9, 9, 9, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 8, 1, 9]\n\n[9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8]\n\n[9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9]\n\n[9, 9, 9, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9]\n\nThis matches the expected pattern where vertical lines of 1s are preserved, and others are replaced with 8s.",
