        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by looking closely at the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nIn the input, there are 8s at positions (3,1), (3,6), (6,4), and (9,6). The output has a lot more 8s. Let me see where they are. The third row in the output (index 3) has 8s from column 1 to 6. Then, rows 4 to 8 in column 6 have 8s. Also, in row 7, column 4 is 8, which is part of the original input. So maybe the 8s are being connected in some way, like forming lines between them?\n\nWait, maybe each 8 in the input acts as a starting point, and the output connects them with lines either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. But how exactly?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The input 8s are at (1,7), (2,2), (5,5), (5,9), (7,2). The output has 8s in column 2 starting from row 3 to 8, and in row 6, columns 5-9 are 8s. So maybe each 8 is creating a vertical or horizontal line extending until another 8 is in the same line. Or perhaps they form a path between the 8s?\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output connects each 8 to the next one in a certain direction. Like, each 8 is connected to the next one in the same row or column, filling in the gaps between them. But the examples don't show a straightforward connection. For instance, in Example 0, the 8s in row 3 (columns 1 and 6) are connected horizontally. Then the 8 in row 6, column 4 (input) connects down to row 9, column 6 (another input 8). Wait, in the output, the 8s from row 4 to 8 in column 6 form a vertical line. So maybe each 8 is connected vertically or horizontally to the nearest 8 in that direction, and the space in between is filled with 8s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 8 in the input acts as a source that spreads 8s in all directions until it hits another 8. But that might result in overlapping regions, which might not match the examples. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the horizontal line from (3,1) to (3,6) connects those two 8s. Then, the 8 at (6,4) in the input (row 7, column 4?) Wait, the input's 8s are at (3,1), (3,6), (7,4), (9,6). In the output, the vertical line from row 4 to 9 in column 6 connects (3,6) and (9,6), but the 7,4 is connected how? The output has a vertical line in column 6, starting from row 3 to row 9. Wait, the original (3,6) and (9,6) are in column 6, rows 3 and 9. The vertical line connects them. Then the 8 at (7,4) in the input (row 7, column 4) in the output has 8s in column 6 from row 3 to 9, but also in row 7, column 4. Hmm, maybe there's another connection here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 8 in the input creates a line extending to the right and down until another 8 is encountered. Let's see. In Example 0, the first 8 at (3,1) (row 3, column 1) might extend to the right until (3,6), then from (3,6) down to (9,6). Then the 8 at (7,4) in input (row 7, column 4) would extend to the right? But in the output, row 7 has 8s at column 4 and 6. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Compare the input and output for each 8. For each 8 in the input, the output has lines extending in some direction. For example, in Example 1's input, the 8 at row 1, column 7 (input) is in the output's same spot. Then the 8 at row 6, column 5 (input) becomes part of a horizontal line in row 6 from column 5 to 9. The 8s at row 8, column 2 (input) and row 2, column 3 (input) form a vertical line in column 2 from row 3 to row 8. So maybe each 8 in the input is connected to the next 8 in the same row or column, filling the space between them.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the 8s in row 6 are at columns 5 and 9. The output connects them with 8s between. Similarly, the 8s in column 2 (rows 3 and 7) are connected with vertical 8s. But the 8 in row 8, column 2 (input) might be part of that vertical line. Hmm, perhaps the vertical line connects all 8s in column 2 that are in consecutive rows. But in the input, there's an 8 at (3,2) (row 3, column 2?), but in the input of example 1, the 8s are at row 3, column 2 (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), no. Let me check the input of example 1 again.\n\nWait, the input for Example 1 is:\n\nINPUT: \n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]  --> row 1, column 7\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] --> row 3, column 2\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8] --> row 6, columns 5 and 9\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] --> row 8, column 2\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe output for Example 1 has in row 6, columns 5 to 9 as 8s. So the 8 at (6,5) and (6,9) in input are connected with a horizontal line. Then, in column 2, rows 3,4,5,6,7,8 have 8s. So the input 8s at row3, column2 and row8, column2 are connected vertically, but how? Because there's another 8 at row8, column2. So the vertical line starts at row3, column2 and goes down to row8, column2. So all the cells between them in that column are filled with 8s. Similarly, the horizontal line connects the 8 at row6, column5 and column9.\n\nSo the pattern could be: For each pair of 8s in the same row or column, fill the cells between them with 8s. If there are multiple 8s in the same row or column, connect them all by filling the spaces in between.\n\nBut how to handle when there are multiple 8s in different rows and columns. Let's look at Example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2's input 8s are at:\n\nRow1, column1 and column5.\n\nRow4, column1.\n\nRow7, columns5 and 9.\n\nRow9, column2.\n\nThe output has:\n\nRow1, columns1-5 filled with 8s (connecting the two 8s in row1).\n\nRows2-4, column1 have 8s (connecting row1, column1 and row4, column1? Because row4 has 8 in column1, so vertical line from row1 to row4 in column1.\n\nThen, in row7, columns5-9 are 8s, connecting the input 8 at row7, column5 and 9.\n\nAlso, in column5, rows1 to7 might have some 8s? Wait, in output example2's row7, columns5-9 are 8s. The input 8s in row7 are at column5 and 9, so they are connected horizontally.\n\nBut there's also an 8 at row9, column2. How is that connected? In the output, row9, column2 remains 8, but maybe there's a vertical line from row9, column2 to another 8 above. But looking at the output, in column2, rows9 has 8, but no others. So maybe that 8 isn't connected to any others in the same column. So perhaps only 8s that are in the same row or column with another 8 are connected, and the ones that are isolated remain as is.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: For each row, if there are two or more 8s, connect them with 8s in between. Similarly, for each column, if there are two or more 8s, connect them with 8s in between. So the transformation is to fill in all the cells between any two 8s in the same row or column, creating lines between them.\n\nSo in the input, all original 8s are kept, and between any two 8s in the same row or column, fill the cells in between with 8s.\n\nLet me check this against the examples.\n\nExample0 input has 8s in row3, columns1 and6. So the output fills row3, columns1-6 with 8s. Then, in column6, there are 8s in row3 and row9. So fill all cells between row3 and row9 in column6 with 8s. Also, there's an 8 in row7, column4 in the input. But in column4, there's only that 8. So it's not connected to any others, so it remains. However, in the output, row7, column4 is 8, but there's also an 8 in column6, row7. Wait, column6's vertical line comes from the 8s in row3 and row9. So row7, column6 is part of that vertical line.\n\nSo yes, for any two 8s in the same row or column, connect them with 8s in between.\n\nSo for the test input, I need to look at all 8s in the input and connect them in their rows and columns.\n\nLet's look at the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: all zeros.\n\nRow1: 0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 --> 8 at column1.\n\nRow2:0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0 --> 8 at column3.\n\nRow3:0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0 --> 8 at column7.\n\nRow4: all zeros.\n\nRow5:0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 --> 8 at column1.\n\nRow6: all zeros.\n\nRow7: all zeros.\n\nRow8:0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0 --> 8s at columns4 and7.\n\nRow9: all zeros.\n\nSo the 8s in the test input are at:\n\nRow1, column1.\n\nRow2, column3.\n\nRow3, column7.\n\nRow5, column1.\n\nRow8, columns4 and7.\n\nNow, let's process each row and column.\n\nRows:\n\nRow1: Only one 8 at column1. So no action.\n\nRow2: Only one 8 at column3. No action.\n\nRow3: Only one 8 at column7. No action.\n\nRow5: Only one 8 at column1. No action.\n\nRow8: Two 8s at columns4 and7. So fill columns4 to7 in row8 with 8s. So row8 becomes [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0].\n\nColumns:\n\nCheck columns where there are multiple 8s.\n\nColumn1: 8s in row1 and row5. So fill rows1 to5 in column1 with 8s. So rows1,2,3,4,5 in column1 become 8s.\n\nColumn3: Only one 8 in row2. No action.\n\nColumn4: Only one 8 in row8. No action.\n\nColumn7: 8s in row3 and row8. So fill rows3 to8 in column7. So rows3,4,5,6,7,8 in column7 become 8s.\n\nSo combining these:\n\nIn rows1-5, column1, all cells become 8.\n\nIn rows3-8, column7, all cells become 8.\n\nIn row8, columns4-7 become 8.\n\nAlso, the original 8s are preserved.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nRow1: column1 is 8 (from original and the vertical line between rows1-5). The rest in row1 are 0 except column1.\n\nRow2: column1 (from vertical line) and column3 (original 8).\n\nRow3: column1 (vertical), column7 (original and vertical line), and rows3's column7 is part of the vertical line from row3 to row8.\n\nRow5: column1 (vertical) and original 8.\n\nRow8: columns4-7 (from row's horizontal connection) and column7 (vertical line), and column4 is part of the horizontal line.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nLet's construct each row step by step.\n\nRow0: all zeros.\n\nRow1: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 but column1 is filled from row1 to row5. So rows1-5, column1 are 8. So row1: column1 is 8. The rest are 0 except possibly others. Wait, the row's original 8 is at column1. So after vertical fill, row1's column1 is 8. So row1 becomes [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But wait, the vertical line from row1 to row5 would set column1 for rows1-5 to 8. So:\n\nRow1: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 because column1 is filled (8) and column3 is original 8.\n\nRow3: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 column1 (8), column7 (8 from vertical line starting at row3's original 8 up to row8's column7. Wait, the original 8 in row3, column7 is part of the vertical line from row3 to row8. So rows3 to8, column7 are 8.\n\nRow4: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 column1 and column7 are 8.\n\nRow5: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 original 8 in column1 (now part of vertical line) and column7 (part of vertical).\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 column7 is part of vertical line.\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 column7.\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0] \u2192 columns4-7 (from horizontal line between column4 and7 in row8) and column7 (vertical line).\n\nRow9: all zeros.\n\nWait, but what about the vertical line from column7. Rows3 to8 in column7 are 8. So rows3,4,5,6,7,8, column7 are 8.\n\nNow, let's check row8. The horizontal line in row8 between columns4 and7 (original 8s at 4 and7) would set columns4-7 to 8. So row8's columns4-7 are 8. And column7 is part of that, so yes.\n\nSo compiling all rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (column1 is 8, others 0)\n\nRow2: [0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0] (column1 and 3 are 8)\n\nRow3: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0] (columns1 and7)\n\nRow4: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0] (original 8 in column1 and vertical line)\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0] (columns4-7 filled)\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, in row2, the original 8 is at column3. Since column3 has only that 8, no vertical line. But row2's column1 is part of the vertical line from column1 (rows1-5). So row2's column1 is 8 (from vertical line) and column3 is 8 (original).\n\nSo the output for row2 is [0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nSimilarly, row3's column1 (8 from vertical) and column7 (8 from vertical line starting at row3's original 8 down to row8's column7).\n\nWait, the vertical line in column7 is from row3 to row8. So rows3,4,5,6,7,8 in column7 are 8. So yes, row3's column7 is 8, row4's column7 is 8, etc.\n\nSo the final output should look like this:\n\nRow0: all zeros.\n\nRow1: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow9: all zeros.\n\nWait, but in row5, the original input has an 8 at column1. So after filling the vertical line from row1 to row5 in column1, that's covered. But in column7, rows3-8 are filled, so row5's column7 is 8.\n\nYes. Now let's check if there's any other connections. For example, in row8's columns4-7 are filled. Are there any other rows or columns with 8s that need to be connected?\n\nLooking at the test input's row8: columns4 and7 are 8s. So fill between them in the same row, so columns4-7 become 8.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about column1's 8s in rows1,5. So between them, rows1 to5 in column1 are filled. So rows1,2,3,4,5 in column1 are 8.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the final output should match the constructed rows above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples, then apply that to the test input. Let me start by carefully analyzing each example.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input: There are several 8s in positions like row 3 (index 3, assuming rows are 0-indexed) at column 1 and 6, row 7 column 4, and row 9 column 6. The output for this example has a lot more 8s. In the output, row 3 has a horizontal line of 8s from column 1 to 6. Then, from row 4 to 8 in column 6, there are 8s going down, and row 7 column 4 is 8, which connects to the vertical line. It looks like each original 8 is acting as a seed to create lines either horizontally or vertically, perhaps connecting to other 8s. But how exactly?\n\nIn the output of Example 0, the original 8s are part of horizontal or vertical lines. For instance, the two 8s in row 3 (columns 1 and 6) are connected by filling in all the cells between them. Then, the 8 in row 7 column 4 and the one in row 9 column 6 might form a vertical line. Wait, row 7 column 4 is connected down to row 9 column 6? Maybe not. Let me check the output again. Oh, in the output, the 8s in row 3 form a horizontal line. Then, from row 3 column 6, there's a vertical line going down through rows 4,5,6,7,8,9 in column 6. Also, the 8 in row 7 column 4 is part of that vertical line in column 6? No, column 6's line is separate. Hmm, maybe each original 8 is the start of a line that extends either right or down until it meets another line or the edge.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that each 8 in the input is connected to the next 8 in the same row or column. Let me check. In Example 0's input, row 3 has 8s at columns 1 and 6. In the output, those are connected with a horizontal line. Then the 8 at row 9 column 6 in the input is part of the vertical line starting from row 3 column 6? Because in the output, column 6 has 8s from row 3 down to row 9. So maybe the lines are drawn between the 8s. So the 8s in the input are connected either horizontally or vertically, and the output fills in the lines between them.\n\nIn Example 1's input, there are 8s at (1,7), (3,2), (6,5), (6,9), (8,2). The output shows that the 8 at (3,2) is part of a vertical line from row 3 to row 8 in column 2. The 8 at (6,5) and (6,9) are connected horizontally, making a line from column 5 to 9 in row 6. The 8 at (1,7) remains as is, maybe because there's no other 8 in that row or column to connect to. The 8 at (8,2) is part of the vertical line in column 2. So the pattern might be: for each 8 in the input, draw a line either to the right until the next 8 in the same row, or downward until the next 8 in the same column. If there's another 8 in the same row or column, connect them with a line of 8s. If not, maybe leave it as is or extend to the edge?\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the 8s in row 6 (columns 5 and 9) are connected, so the horizontal line from 5 to 9. The vertical line in column 2 starts at row 3 to row 8. So perhaps the lines are drawn between every pair of 8s in the same row or column, filling in the spaces between them. So for each row, if there are two or more 8s, connect them horizontally. For each column, if there are two or more 8s, connect them vertically. But how about when there are multiple 8s in the same row or column? Like in Example 2's input.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input: 8s are at (1,1), (1,5), (4,1), (7,5), (7,9), (9,2). The output shows that in row 1, columns 1-5 are filled (so connecting 1 and 5). Then, in column 5, there's a vertical line from row 1 down to row 7. Also, the 8s in row 7 columns 5 and 9 are connected horizontally. The 8 at (9,2) is alone. So in row 1, the two 8s at 1 and 5 are connected horizontally. Then, the 8 at (4,1) is part of a vertical line in column 1? Wait, in the output, row 1 to row 4 in column 1 are filled. So maybe the 8s at (1,1) and (4,1) are connected vertically. Wait, but in the input, (4,1) is 8. In the output, column 1 has 8s in rows 1,2,3,4. So connecting (1,1) to (4,1) vertically. Then, column 5's vertical line from row 1 (from the horizontal line) down to row 7. Then row 7's 5 and 9 are connected. So it seems like lines are drawn between 8s both horizontally and vertically, and where lines intersect, they continue. So for each pair of 8s in the same row or column, draw a line between them, and then if those lines intersect with other lines, perhaps extend them. But maybe it's a matter of connecting all 8s in the same row and column with lines, filling in the cells between them, and also extending lines from the endpoints if there's another 8 in the same row or column. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each 8 in the input is a \"source\" that sends out horizontal and vertical lines to the right and down, respectively, until they hit another line or the edge. Wait, but in Example 0's input, the 8 at row 3 column 6 (input) is connected to the 8 at row 3 column 1 via a horizontal line, and then from column 6, a vertical line down to row 9. So maybe each 8 sends lines to the right and down. But how does that work with other examples?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 8 in the input is a node, and the output connects them with lines horizontally and vertically, creating a grid-like structure. For example, if there's an 8 in a row, you connect all 8s in that row with a horizontal line, and in their respective columns, connect them vertically with other 8s. But how to handle multiple 8s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lines are drawn horizontally first between 8s in the same row, then vertically from each endpoint of those horizontal lines downward until they hit another horizontal line or the edge.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output: the horizontal line in row 3 from column 1 to 6, then from column 6, a vertical line down to row 9. The 8 in row 7 column 4 in the input becomes part of the vertical line in column 6? No, in the output, column 6 has vertical line from row 3 to 9. The 8 at row 7 column 4 is part of the vertical line in column 6? No, that's in column 4. Wait, maybe the 8 in row7 column4 is connected to something else. But in the output, row7 column4 is 8 (original input), and the vertical line in column6 is present. So perhaps the 8 in row7 column4 is part of a vertical line that's connected to the 8 in column6 via some rule. Or maybe not. Maybe the vertical line in column6 comes from the horizontal line in row3. So perhaps once you draw a horizontal line between two 8s, you then draw vertical lines from each end of that horizontal line downward.\n\nBut in Example0's input, the horizontal line in row3 connects columns1 to6. Then, from each end (column1 and column6), draw vertical lines downward. But in the output, column1 in row3 has an 8, but in the rows below, there's no vertical line. However, column6 has a vertical line going all the way down to row9. So maybe the vertical line starts at column6, row3, and goes down. But why? Because in the input, there's another 8 at row9 column6. So maybe the vertical line connects row3 column6 to row9 column6. Because in the input, row3 column6 is 8 and row9 column6 is 8, so the vertical line connects them, filling in the cells in between. Similarly, in Example1's input, the 8 at row6 column5 and row6 column9 are connected by a horizontal line (columns5-9). Then, the 8 in row6 column9 is part of a vertical line? No, in the output, column9 has a vertical line from row6 to row9? Wait, in Example1's output, row6 has 8s from column5 to 9. Then in column9, row6 to row6 (only the same row). But maybe the vertical line isn't present. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each 8 in the input, draw a horizontal line extending to the right until the next 8 in the same row, and a vertical line extending downward until the next 8 in the same column. If there are no 8s in the same row to the right, then the horizontal line stops. Similarly for vertical.\n\nBut let's test this with Example0's input. In row3, there are 8s at columns1 and6. So between them, draw a horizontal line. Then, for each of those 8s, draw vertical lines downward until the next 8 in their respective columns. The 8 at column1 in row3: looking down column1 from row3, there are no other 8s (input has row9 column6, but that's in column6). So vertical line from row3 column1 would stop. But in the output, there's no vertical line here. The 8 at column6 in row3: looking down column6 from row3, there is an 8 in row9 column6. So draw a vertical line from row3 to row9 in column6. That's exactly what's in the output. The 8 in row7 column4: looking right, no 8s in the same row. Looking down column4, maybe there's no 8s below. But in the output, there's an 8 in row7 column4 (original) and also in row7 column4 of the output. So perhaps this 8 is only part of the vertical line if there's another 8 below or above. Wait, in the output, row7 column4 is part of a vertical line from row7 column4 to where? The output's row7 has 8 in column4 and column6. Hmm, maybe the 8 in row7 column4 is connected to the vertical line in column6 via a horizontal line? No, the 8 in row7 column4 is in column4, but the vertical line is in column6. So that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are points where horizontal and vertical lines cross. For instance, each 8 in the input creates a horizontal line extending to the right until another 8 or edge, and a vertical line extending down until another 8 or edge. But how do the training examples fit this?\n\nLooking at Example0's input:\n\nRow3 has 8s at columns1 and6. So for each of these:\n\n- 8 at row3 column1: draws horizontal line right until next 8 (column6). So the line from 1 to6. Then vertical line down from row3 column1. Since no 8s below in column1, it stops. But the output doesn't have a vertical line here. However, the vertical line in column6 is present from row3 to row9, which connects the 8 at row3 column6 to row9 column6.\n\nSo the vertical line in column6 is drawn because there's an 8 in row9 column6. So for each 8 in the input, check if there's another 8 in the same column below it. If so, connect them with a vertical line. Similarly for rows: if there's another 8 to the right in the same row, connect them with a horizontal line.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each pair of 8s in the same row (horizontally adjacent or with space in between), draw a horizontal line between them. Similarly, for each pair of 8s in the same column (vertically adjacent or with space), draw a vertical line between them. Then, all cells that are on any of these lines are filled with 8s.\n\nBut how about when there are multiple 8s in the same row or column. For example, in a row with three 8s. Then the lines would connect between consecutive pairs. But the training examples don't have such cases, so perhaps the pattern is that between every pair of 8s in the same row or column, you draw lines.\n\nBut perhaps it's that each 8 in the input causes a line to the next 8 in the same row (to the right) and the next 8 in the same column (below), filling in the cells between.\n\nLet me test this with Example1's input. In row6, there are 8s at column5 and9. So between them, draw a horizontal line. For column5, looking down from row6, there's no 8s below. For column9, looking down, no 8s. But in the output, the horizontal line from 5 to9 is present. Also, in column2, there's an 8 at row3 and row8. So draw a vertical line between them. Thus, in the output, column2 has 8s from row3 to row8, inclusive.\n\nThat seems to fit. So the rule would be: for each 8 in the input, look to the right in the same row until the next 8 (if any) and fill those cells. Then, look down in the same column until the next 8 (if any) and fill those cells. If there's no next 8 in the row or column, don't extend beyond.\n\nBut in Example0, the 8 at row3 column6 and row9 column6. So the vertical line connects them. Similarly, in row3 column1 and column6, the horizontal line connects them.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. For each cell in the input grid:\n   a. If it's an 8, check to the right in the same row for the next 8. If found, fill all cells between them (inclusive) with 8s.\n   b. Also, check downward in the same column for the next 8. If found, fill all cells between them (inclusive) with 8s.\n\nBut this would cause overlapping lines. For example, if two 8s are in the same row, their horizontal line is drawn. If one of them is in a column with another 8 below, that vertical line is also drawn. But does this explain all training examples?\n\nLet's apply this rule to Example0:\n\nInput row3 has 8s at columns1 and6. So between them, fill columns1-6 with 8s (horizontal line). Then, for each of those 8s, check down their columns.\n\n- Column1: only the 8 at row3, no others below. So no vertical line.\n- Column6: there's an 8 at row9. So fill rows3-9 in column6 with 8s (vertical line).\n\nAdditionally, the 8 at row7 column4 in the input. Check right: no 8s. Check down: no 8s. So no lines. But in the output, row7 column4 is 8 (original), and there's a vertical line in column6 from row3 to 9. Also, the output has a vertical line from row3 column6 down to row9, which includes the 8 at row7 column4? Wait, no. Column6's vertical line runs through rows3-9, but row7 column4 is in column4. So perhaps that 8 is part of another line. Wait, in the input, there's an 8 at row7 column4 and row9 column6. So for row7 column4, checking right: no 8s. Check down in column4: no 8s. So no lines. But in the output, that 8 is present, but not part of any line. So the output preserves all original 8s and adds lines between them.\n\nBut the output has 8s that are not in the input. Like in Example0's output, row3 columns2-5 are 8s (filled between 1 and6). Also, rows4-9 in column6 are filled. So those are added because of the lines between the input 8s.\n\nSo the rule is: connect each pair of 8s in the same row or column with lines, filling all cells between them. The original 8s are part of the lines. So any two 8s in the same row or column, even if there are other 8s in between, are connected. Wait, but what if there's a third 8 in between? Then the lines would be between consecutive pairs.\n\nBut in the training examples, there are no such cases. Let's proceed.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n- For each row, scan for 8s. For each pair of 8s in the same row (regardless of their positions), fill all cells between them with 8s.\n- For each column, scan for 8s. For each pair of 8s in the same column, fill all cells between them with 8s.\n\nBut wait, this would mean that even if there are multiple 8s in a row, all pairs are considered and the entire range from the leftmost to the rightmost 8 is filled. For example, in a row with 8s at columns 1,3,5: the entire 1-5 would be filled. Similarly for columns.\n\nBut in Example1's input, row6 has 8s at columns5 and9. So filling between them gives columns5-9 filled. The output shows exactly that. For the column2 8s at rows3 and8: filling between them gives rows3-8 in column2 filled.\n\nYes, this seems to fit. So the pattern is: for each row, find all the 8s and fill the entire range from the leftmost to the rightmost 8. Similarly, for each column, fill the range from the topmost to the bottommost 8.\n\nWait, that's different. For example, in a row with 8s at columns2 and5, you fill from 2 to5. So all cells in between. Similarly for columns.\n\nBut let's check Example0's input:\n\nRow3 has 8s at columns1 and6. So leftmost is 1, rightmost is6. Fill columns1-6. The output's row3 indeed has 1-6 as 8s. Column6 has 8s in rows3 and9. So topmost is3, bottommost is9. Fill rows3-9. So column6 in output has 8s from row3 to9.\n\nIn Example1's input, row6 has 8s at5 and9. So columns5-9 filled. Column2 has 8s at rows3 and8. So rows3-8 filled.\n\nIn Example2's input:\n\nRow1 has 8s at1 and5. So columns1-5 filled. Column1 has 8s at rows1 and4. So rows1-4 filled. Column5 has 8s at row1 and7. So rows1-7 filled. Row7 has 8s at5 and9. So columns5-9 filled. The output shows these filled ranges.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each row, the leftmost and rightmost 8s define a horizontal line that fills all cells between them. For each column, the topmost and bottommost 8s define a vertical line that fills all cells between them. All such cells are set to 8, including the original positions.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each row in the input grid:\n   a. Find all columns where there is an 8.\n   b. If there are at least two 8s, set all cells between the leftmost and rightmost 8 (inclusive) to 8.\n2. For each column in the input grid:\n   a. Find all rows where there is an 8.\n   b. If there are at least two 8s, set all cells between the topmost and bottommost 8 (inclusive) to 8.\n\nBut wait, what if there is only one 8 in a row or column? Then, steps 1b and 2b are not executed. So the output would only have that single 8, unless it's covered by a vertical line from a column.\n\nWait, but in Example0's column6, there are two 8s (row3 and9). So the vertical line is filled between them. But in Example1's row1, there's only one 8 (column7), but in the output, it remains as is. So for rows and columns with only one 8, no lines are drawn. Only when there are two or more 8s in the same row/column.\n\nBut looking at Example2's input. Let's take row7: input has 8s at columns5 and9. So in the output, row7 has 5-9 filled. Column5 in the input has 8s at row1 (from row1's horizontal line) and row7. So vertical line from row1 to row7 filled. So column5's cells between row1 and7 are filled.\n\nSo applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: all 0s.\n\nRow1: column1 is 8.\n\nRow2: column3 is8.\n\nRow3: column7 is8.\n\nRow4: all 0s.\n\nRow5: column1 is8.\n\nRow6: all 0s.\n\nRow7: all 0s.\n\nRow8: columns4 and7 are8.\n\nRow9: all 0s.\n\nNow, applying the pattern:\n\nFor each row:\n\nRow1 has one 8 (col1) \u2192 no horizontal line.\n\nRow2 has one 8 (col3) \u2192 no line.\n\nRow3 has one 8 (col7) \u2192 no line.\n\nRow5 has one 8 (col1) \u2192 no line.\n\nRow8 has 8s at cols4 and7 \u2192 leftmost is4, rightmost is7 \u2192 fill cols4-7.\n\nFor each column:\n\nColumn1 has 8s in rows1 and5. So fill rows1-5.\n\nColumn3 has one 8 (row2) \u2192 no line.\n\nColumn4 has 8 in row8. \u2192 no line.\n\nColumn7 has 8s in row3 and8. So fill rows3-8.\n\nColumn8 in row8: one 8 \u2192 no line.\n\nSo applying these:\n\nRow8: cols4-7 are filled (from row's own 8s).\n\nColumn1: rows1-5 filled.\n\nColumn7: rows3-8 filled.\n\nNow, let's construct the output grid.\n\nInitialize all cells to 0.\n\nThen, for rows with 8s:\n\nRow1: no horizontal line (only one 8).\n\nRow2: no line.\n\nRow3: no line (only one 8).\n\nRow5: no line.\n\nRow8: cols4-7 filled (including original 8s at4 and7).\n\nFor columns with 8s:\n\nColumn1: rows1-5 filled.\n\nColumn7: rows3-8 filled.\n\nSo combining these:\n\nRow1's column1 is part of column1's vertical line (rows1-5). So row1, col1 is 8.\n\nRows1-5, column1: all 8s.\n\nRows3-8, column7: all 8s.\n\nRow8, columns4-7: 8s.\n\nNow, also, any cell that is part of both a row's horizontal line and a column's vertical line would have 8.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\nLet's build the output step by step.\n\nOriginal input 8s:\n\nRow1, col1.\n\nRow2, col3.\n\nRow3, col7.\n\nRow5, col1.\n\nRow8, col4 and7.\n\nApply row processing:\n\nOnly row8's cols4-7 are filled.\n\nApply column processing:\n\nColumn1's rows1-5 filled.\n\nColumn7's rows3-8 filled.\n\nSo the output grid would have:\n\n- Column1 (rows1-5) are 8s.\n\n- Column7 (rows3-8) are 8s.\n\n- Row8 (cols4-7) are 8s.\n\nBut also, row8's col4 is part of column4, but column4 has only one 8 (row8), so no vertical line. So row8's cols4-7 are filled due to row processing.\n\nAdditionally, any overlapping between row and column processing.\n\nFor example, row8, col4 is filled via row processing. Row8, col7 is filled via row processing and column processing (row8 is part of column7's 3-8).\n\nNow, let's construct the output row by row.\n\nRow0: all 0s.\n\nRow1: column1 is8 (from column1's vertical line rows1-5). So row1: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but according to column1's processing, rows1-5 are filled. So row1's column1 is 8.\n\nRow2: column1's row2 is part of column1's vertical line (rows1-5). So row2, column1 is8. Also, row2's column3 was originally 8, but according to row processing, row2 has only one 8 (col3), so no horizontal line. So row2's col3 is8, but column3 has no vertical lines (only one 8). So row2: [0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0] ?\n\nWait, no. Because column1's vertical line from rows1-5: so row2, column1 is8.\n\nRow2's original input has 8 in column3. So after row processing, since row2 has only one 8, no horizontal line. But column3 has only one 8 (row2, column3), so no vertical line. So in row2, column3 is8 (original) and column1 is8 (from vertical line). So row2 would be [0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut wait, the column1's vertical line is rows1-5. So row2, column1 is filled.\n\nRow3: column7's vertical line is rows3-8. So row3, column7 is8. Also, column1's vertical line is up to row5, so row3, column1 is8. But row3's original input has 8 in column7. So row3 would have 8s in column1 (from column1's vertical line) and column7 (from column7's vertical line). But what about the row processing for row3? In the input, row3 has one 8 in column7. So row processing doesn't add anything. Column7's processing fills column7 from row3 to8. So row3's column7 is8. Additionally, column1's processing adds 8 in column1 for row3.\n\nSo row3: [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,8, 0, 0] ?\n\nWait, no. Column1's vertical line is rows1-5. So row3 is part of that. So column1 in row3 is8. Column7's vertical line starts at row3, so column7 in row3 is8. So row3 would be [8 (col1), ... ,8 (col7)].\n\nBut how about the rest of the row? No, other columns in row3 are filled via row processing. But row3's row processing has only one 8 in column7. So no horizontal line. So the other columns are 0, except column1 (from column1's vertical line) and column7 (from column7's vertical line).\n\nSo row3 would be:\n\n[8 (col1), 0,0,0,0,0,0,8 (col7), 0,0]\n\nBut wait, no. Column1's vertical line is rows1-5. So rows1 to5 in column1 are 8. So row3's column1 is8.\n\nSimilarly, column7's vertical line is rows3-8. So row3's column7 is8.\n\nSo row3's output is:\n\n[8, 0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow4: column1 is8 (from column1's vertical line). column7's vertical line starts at row3, so row4's column7 is8. So row4: [8,0,...0,8,..].\n\nRow5: column1 is8 (from column1's vertical line). column7's vertical line (row5 is in 3-8). So row5's column7 is8. So row5: [8,0,...0,8,..].\n\nRow6: column1's vertical line is up to row5, so row6's column1 is0. column7's vertical line includes row6. So row6's column7 is8. So row6: [0,0,...0,8,..].\n\nRow7: column7's vertical line (rows3-8) \u2192 row7's column7 is8. So row7: [0,0,...0,8,..].\n\nRow8: column7 is8 (from vertical line). Also, row8's cols4-7 are filled via row processing. So row8's columns4-7 are8s. So row8 is:\n\n[0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0] ?\n\nWait, row8's original input has 8s in columns4 and7. So during row processing, since leftmost is4 and rightmost is7, columns4-7 are filled. So row8's columns4,5,6,7 are 8s. So row8: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0].\n\nBut also, column7's vertical line includes row8's column7 (from row3 to8). So row8's column7 is8. But that's already covered by row processing.\n\nRow9: all 0s.\n\nNow, combining all rows:\n\nRow0: all 0s.\n\nRow1: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 from column1's vertical line.\n\nRow2: [0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column1's vertical line and original 8 in column3.\n\nRow3: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 column1's vertical line and column7's vertical line.\n\nRow4: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 same as row3, except column7 is filled.\n\nWait, no. Row4's column1 is8 (from column1's vertical line rows1-5). column7's vertical line includes row4. So row4's columns1 and7 are 8. So row4: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0].\n\nRow5: same as row4, since it's in column1's vertical line and column7's vertical line.\n\nRow5's input has 8 in column1. So row5: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0].\n\nRow6: column7 is8 (from vertical line). So row6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0].\n\nRow7: column7 is8 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0].\n\nRow8: columns4-7 filled (8s). So [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0].\n\nRow9: all 0s.\n\nBut wait, this is the initial processing. However, when we process rows, some cells may have been filled by both row and column processing. For example, row8's columns4-7 are filled by row processing, and any cells in those columns may also be filled by column processing. But according to the rules, we process rows first, then columns. Or is it that both row and column processing are done, and their results are combined?\n\nActually, the pattern seems to be that row processing and column processing are both done, and their results are merged. So the output is the union of all cells filled by row processing and column processing.\n\nBut in the training examples, it's possible that some cells are filled by both row and column processing, but in the output, they are just 8s regardless.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nThe row processing only affects row8, filling columns4-7.\n\nThe column processing affects column1 (rows1-5) and column7 (rows3-8).\n\nSo the final output is:\n\nRow0: all 0s.\n\nRow1: 0s except column1 is8.\n\nRow2: column1 and3 are8.\n\nRow3: columns1 and7 are8.\n\nRow4: columns1 and7 are8.\n\nRow5: columns1 and7 are8.\n\nRow6: column7 is8.\n\nRow7: column7 is8.\n\nRow8: columns4-7 are8.\n\nRow9: all 0s.\n\nBut wait, row8's column7 is part of the row processing (columns4-7), which is 8. So row8's columns4-7 are filled.\n\nLet me write out each row properly:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow4: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow5: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, for row3, column1 is8 (from column1's vertical line, which covers rows1-5). So rows1-5 in column1 are8. So row3 is in that range. So row3's column1 is8.\n\nRow3's column7 is8 (from column7's vertical line, rows3-8).\n\nSimilarly, row5's column1 is8 (row5 is part of column1's vertical line) and column7 is8.\n\nRow8's columns4-7 are filled due to row processing.\n\nNow, but column7's vertical line covers rows3-8. So row8's column7 is8.\n\nSo row8's columns4-7 are filled, which includes column7. So that's correct.\n\nThis matches the processing. Now, compare with the training examples' outputs.\n\nBut in Example2's output, rows that are filled via both row and column processing have multiple 8s. So this seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in the test input, row2's column3 is8. But according to the processing, column3 has only one 8 (row2), so no vertical line. So row2's column3 remains 8 (original) but no other cells in column3 are filled.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the final output for the test input would be as constructed above.",
