        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input. Let me start by looking at the examples carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 0. The input has a bunch of 5s forming some shapes. The output changes some of the 0s inside those 5 shapes into 2s. For instance, in row 3 of the input, the 5s form a sort of square, and in the output, the middle 0s become 2s. Similarly, in row 4 and 5, there are 0s inside the 5 structures that turn into 2s. So maybe the pattern is that any 0 that is completely surrounded by 5s (like in a closed area) gets replaced by 2.\n\nWait, let me check another example. Example 1: In the input, there's a section where 5s form a rectangle, and in the output, the inner 0s become 2s. For example, row 4 in the input has 5s around and 0s inside, and in the output, those 0s become 2s. Similarly, in rows 9 and 10, the 0s between the 5s become 2s. So the same idea applies here.\n\nBut how exactly are the 2s placed? It seems like they are replacing 0s that are enclosed by 5s on all four sides. Wait, maybe it's not just four sides. Let's think in terms of regions. Perhaps any contiguous region of 0s that is completely enclosed by 5s (forming a closed loop) gets filled with 2s. But looking at the examples, maybe it's more about individual cells that are surrounded by 5s in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). Wait, in Example 0, row 3, the original cell was 0, surrounded by 5s on top, bottom, left, and right. So maybe if a 0 is adjacent to 5s in all four directions, it becomes a 2.\n\nWait, let me check. In Example 0's input, row 3 is [0,5,0,0,5,...]. The output changes those 0s to 2s. So the two middle 0s in row 3. Let's check their neighbors. For the first 0 (third element in row 3), the cell above is row 2's same column: which is 5. The cell below is row 4's same column: 5. Left is 5 (same row, previous column), right is 0. Wait, wait. Row 3 in input is [0,5,0,0,5,0,...]. So the third element (0) has left as 5 (from index 1), right as 0 (index 3), top is row 2's index 2, which is 5. Bottom is row 4's index 2: which is 5. Wait, but left is 5, right is 0. So maybe that's not all four directions. Hmm. Wait, maybe the direction is not just immediate neighbors. Maybe the 0 is enclosed within a 5 structure. Like forming a loop. For example, if the 0 is part of a region that's entirely enclosed by 5s. So maybe it's a flood fill scenario where any 0 that is enclosed (like in a hollow square) gets filled with 2.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 0s inside the 5 structure are replaced by 2s. Let's look at row 3: the 0s are between 5s. For instance, the third element in row 3 is 0. The cells around it (above, below, left, right) are 5, 5, 5, 0 (from row 3's input). Wait, the right neighbor is 0, which is part of the same row. So maybe that's not surrounded by 5s. Hmm, maybe my initial thought is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the 0s that are part of the inner area of a rectangle made of 5s. Like, in the first example, the 5s form a square with a hollow center, and the 0s in that hollow become 2s. But how to detect such regions?\n\nLooking at Example 1's output. In row 9 and 10 of the input, there are 0s between two 5s. In the output, these 0s become 2s. For example, row 9: input is [5,0,0,5,5,0,...], output is [5,2,2,5,5,0,...]. So the two 0s are between 5s. But in that case, the 0s are adjacent to 5s on the left and right (assuming those positions). Wait, let me check the exact indices. Let's take row 9 of Example 1's input: [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, ...]. So the 0s at positions 1 and 2. The left neighbor is 5 (position 0), right neighbor is 5 (position 3). But what about the top and bottom? For the 0 at row 9, column 1: top would be row 8, column 1. Row 8 in the input is [5,5,5,5,5,0,...], so column 1 is 5. The bottom would be row 10, column 1, which is also 5 (input row 10 is [5,0,0,5,5,0,...], but column 1 is 0. Wait, that's not 5. Wait, maybe I'm getting the rows wrong. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, row indices go from 0 to 11. Let's take row 9 in the input: [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So for the 0s at columns 1 and 2. The cell above (row 8, columns 1 and 2) would be row 8: [5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5]. So columns 1 and 2 in row 8 are 5 and 5. The cell below (row 10, columns 1 and 2) is [5,0,0,5,5,0,...], so columns 1 and 2 are 0 and 0. Wait, so the 0s at row 9, columns 1 and 2 have 5 above, 0 below. So they're not surrounded on all four sides. But in the output, they become 2s. So maybe the direction isn't all four. Alternatively, maybe they're part of a horizontal corridor between 5s. Or maybe it's a vertical and horizontal enclosure.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that a 0 is replaced by 2 if it is part of a 2x2 square of 0s. Let's check example 0. In the input, the 0s that become 2s are in positions that form a 2x2 block. For instance, in row 3, columns 2 and 3, and row 4, columns 2 and 3. So that's a 2x2 block of 0s surrounded by 5s. But in example 1's row 9, the 0s are two in a row (columns 1 and 2), but not a 2x2. But in example 1's output, those two 0s become 2s, even though they are not a 2x2. So that theory is probably wrong.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs, the 2s are replacing 0s that are inside closed regions formed by 5s. So it's a flood fill scenario where any 0 that is enclosed by 5s (so cannot reach the boundary of the grid) is replaced by 2. Let's check example 0. The 0s that become 2s are in regions that are fully enclosed. For example, in row 3, columns 2 and 3. The 5s form a loop around them. Similarly, in example 1, the 0s in row 9 are between 5s on the left and right, but maybe they are enclosed in some other way. Wait, but if the 0s in example 1's row 9 are at the top or bottom of the grid, perhaps they are not enclosed. Wait, row 9 is near the bottom (assuming rows go from 0 to 11). If those 0s are in the middle of the grid, maybe they are enclosed by 5s in all directions except maybe up and down. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in cells that are exactly two cells away from the edge of a 5 structure. Wait, not sure. Let me try to think of another angle.\n\nLooking at all the training examples, the 2s are only present in the output where the input had 0s that are inside 5s. So perhaps the transformation is to fill the inner areas of 5s' loops with 2s.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's input, there's a square made of 5s. The inner 0s are replaced by 2s. Similarly, in Example 2's input, the inner 0s in the 5 structures become 2s.\n\nSo the pattern might be that any 0 cell that is enclosed by 5s (i.e., part of a closed region formed by 5s) is converted to 2. So the algorithm is to find all regions of 0s that are completely surrounded by 5s and replace them with 2s.\n\nTo implement this, we can perform a flood fill algorithm to detect 0 regions that are not connected to the grid's border. Those regions would be enclosed and thus replaced by 2s.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis against the examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the 0s that are in the middle of the 5 squares are enclosed and thus become 2s. The 0s near the edges of the grid remain 0 because they are connected to the border. Wait, but in the training example 0, the first two rows are all 0s. So any 0 connected to them would be part of the border and not filled. But in the output, some 0s in the middle are filled. So yes, that's consistent with the flood fill idea.\n\nSimilarly, in example 3's input, there's a 5 structure in the lower part. The inner 0s (like in row 7,8,9) would be surrounded by 5s. Wait, but in example 3's output, those cells are 0s. Wait, no. Let me check example 3's input and output. Wait, example 3's input has a structure in the lower half. Let me see:\n\nInput rows 6-10 (assuming 0-based) are:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn the output, these rows are the same as the input. So the inner 0s here are not replaced. But according to the flood fill theory, those 0s are part of regions that are connected to the border. For example, the 0s in row 7 (input row 7) are part of a structure that's not enclosed. Because the 5s are forming a U-shape perhaps, allowing the 0s to be connected to the outside.\n\nWait, maybe the 0s in the example 3 input's lower part are not enclosed. Let's visualize:\n\nIn row 6, the 5s form a horizontal line. Then rows 7 and 8 have 5s in columns 3 and 6-7. Wait, perhaps the 0s in row 7, columns 4 and 5 (if that's the case) are connected to the right side. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the 0s in row 7 are adjacent to 0s in other rows that connect to the border.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the algorithm isn't about enclosed regions, but about individual cells that are surrounded by 5s in all four directions. Let's check that.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's row 3, columns 2 and 3 are 0s. The cells above (row 2, same column) is 5, below (row 4, same column) is 5. Left (row 3, column 1) is 5. Right (row 3, column 4) is 5. So the four directions (up, down, left, right) are all 5s. Wait, but row 3 is [0,5,0,0,5,...]. So columns 2 and 3 in row 3: their left is 5 (column 1), right is 5 (column 4? Wait, column indexes: row 3 is [0,5,0,0,5,0,...]. So columns 0 to 11. So for column 2 (third element, 0), left neighbor is column 1 (5), right neighbor is column 3 (0). Wait, so in that case, the right neighbor is 0, not 5. So this 0 is not surrounded by 5s in all four directions. So that theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's about being enclosed in a 3x3 area. Or perhaps the pattern is that if a 0 is adjacent (including diagonally) to four 5s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in cells that are part of a \"hole\" in a 5 structure, similar to how the number 0 can have a hole, and the hole is filled with 2. For instance, the 5s form the outline of a shape, and the inner part (holes) are filled with 2s.\n\nSo the algorithm would be: identify all 0s that are enclosed within a loop of 5s (i.e., holes) and replace them with 2s.\n\nTo detect holes, one approach is to perform a flood fill from the borders, marking all 0s that are connected to the border. The remaining 0s (not marked) are the holes and are converted to 2s.\n\nThis seems plausible. Let's verify with the examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has several 0 regions. The first two rows are all 0s, which are connected to the top border, so they remain 0. The 0s in the middle (like row 3, columns 2 and 3) are enclosed by 5s and thus not connected to the border. So they get replaced by 2s. Similarly, in row 10, there's a 0 that is surrounded by 5s, so it becomes 2.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 0s in row 9 and 10 are in the middle of 5s. If they are enclosed and not connected to the border, they would be converted to 2s. But wait, in row 9, the 5s are on the left (column 0) and right (columns 3 and 4?), but are there 5s above and below? Let's see. The rows above and below (row 8 and 10) have 5s in certain columns. For example, in row 9, column 1: above is row 8, column 1 is 5 (from input example 1's row 8: [5,5,5,5,5,0,...]), so row 8, column 1 is 5. Below is row 10, column 1: input row 10 is [5,0,0,5,5,0,...], so 0. So the cell in row 9, column 1 is 0. Above is 5, below is 0. So it's connected to the 0 in row 10. If that 0 is connected to the bottom border (since row 10 is near the bottom), then the entire region would be connected to the border and not filled. But in the output, it's filled with 2. Hmm, this contradicts the flood fill theory.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let's re-examine example 1's input and output.\n\nIn example 1's input, rows 9-11 are:\n\n[5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe output for these rows is:\n\n[5, 2, 2, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[5, 2, 2, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo the two 0s in rows 9 and 10 (columns 1 and 2) are replaced by 2s. But according to the flood fill theory, if those 0s are connected to the border, they should remain 0. Are they connected?\n\nThe 0s in row 9, columns 1 and 2: let's see. The surrounding cells. The cells above (row 8, columns 1 and 2) are 5s. The cells below (row 10, columns 1 and 2) are 0s. The left is 5 (column 0), the right is 5 (column 3). So the 0s in row 9 are connected to row 10's 0s. But row 10's 0s are at the bottom rows (row 10 is the 10th row, since the grid is 12x12). If row 10's 0s are in columns 1 and 2, then they are not adjacent to the bottom border (row 11). Row 11 is [5,5,5,5,5,0,...], so columns 1-2 are 5s. So the 0s in row 10 are not adjacent to the bottom border. Are they connected to any other 0s that reach the border? Let's look at the entire grid. For example, rows 9-10 have 0s, but perhaps those 0s are part of a region that's enclosed by 5s. So the flood fill would mark all 0s connected to the borders. Any 0s not connected would be filled with 2.\n\nIn this case, the 0s in rows 9 and 10 (columns 1 and 2) are part of a region that is enclosed by 5s. Because the left is 5, right is 5, above is 5, and below (row 10's 0s) are enclosed as well. So these 0s are enclosed and thus filled with 2.\n\nSo the flood fill theory seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, the pattern is: replace all 0s that are enclosed by 5s (i.e., not connected to the grid's border) with 2s.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nThe test input is a 12x12 grid. Let's look for regions of 0s that are enclosed by 5s and not connected to the border.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRows:\n\n0: all 0s. Connected to the top border. So any 0s connected to this row remain 0.\n\n1: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0]\n\n2: [5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,0]\n\n3: [5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]\n\n4: [5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]\n\n5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0]\n\n6: all 0s.\n\n7: all 0s.\n\nRows 8-11:\n\n8: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0]\n\n9: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\n10: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\n11: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nNow, looking for enclosed 0 regions.\n\nIn rows 1-5, there are 5s forming structures. For example, row 1 has 5s in columns 0-4, then 0s. But the 0s in row 1 (columns 5, 6, etc.) are adjacent to row 0's 0s (since row 0 is all 0s). So any 0 connected to row 0 would remain 0.\n\nBut looking at the 5 structures in rows 1-5. For example, rows 2-5 form a structure like a '5' square. Let's check row 2: 5 at 0 and 4, with 0s in between. So the 0s in columns 1-3. Are these 0s enclosed?\n\nRow 2: [5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,0]\n\nThe 0s in columns 1-3: left is 5 (column 0), right is 5 (column4). Above is row1's columns 1-3: row1 is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0]. So columns 1-3 are 5,5,5. Below is row3's columns 1-3: 0,0,0. So the 0s in row2 columns 1-3 are surrounded by 5s on top and left/right, but connected to row3's 0s. Let's see row3's columns 1-3: 0s. Are those 0s connected to any border? Row3's 0s are in columns 1-3. Above is row2's 0s. Left is 5 (column0), right is 5 (column4). So these 0s are in a vertical column between 5s. But if they are connected to row4's 0s, which are also in columns 1-3. And row4's 0s are connected to row5's 0s? Wait, row5 is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0]. Columns 5 and 6 are 0s. So the 0s in rows 1-5, columns 5-6 are connected to the right side (since row0 is all 0s, but row1's columns 5-6 are 0,0. So those 0s are connected to row0's 0s. Therefore, the 0s in columns 5-6 are connected to the top border. So any 0s connected to those would remain 0.\n\nBut the 0s in rows 2-4 columns 1-3: are they part of a region connected to the border? Let's see:\n\nRow2, columns1-3: 0s. To the left is 5 (column0). To the right, column4 is 5. Above (row1) is 5,5,5. Below (row3) columns1-3 are 0s. Row3's 0s in columns1-3 have row4's 0s below. Row4's 0s in columns1-3 have row5's 0s below? No, row5's columns1-3 are 5,5,5. So row4's columns1-3 are 0s. Below row4 is row5, which is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0]. So columns1-3 are 5s. So the 0s in rows2-4 columns1-3 are enclosed by 5s. Because:\n\n- Above: row1's columns1-3 are 5s.\n\n- Below: row5's columns1-3 are 5s.\n\n- Left: column0 is 5.\n\n- Right: column4 is 5.\n\nSo these 0s form a vertical tunnel between 5s, but enclosed from top and bottom. Therefore, this region is completely enclosed by 5s and not connected to the border. So in the output, these 0s should be replaced with 2s.\n\nSimilarly, in row2, column8: it's 5. Let's look at other areas.\n\nLooking at rows 8-11: they form a structure similar to a square. Row8 has 5s in columns2-7. Row9 and 10 have 5s at column2 and 7. Row11 has 5s in columns2-7. The 0s in rows9 and 10, columns3-6 are enclosed by 5s. Because:\n\n- Left: column2 is 5.\n\n- Right: column7 is 5.\n\n- Above: row8's columns3-6 are 5s (row8 is [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns3-6 are 5,5,5,5).\n\n- Below: row11's columns3-6 are 5s (row11 is [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0], columns3-6 are 5,5,5,5).\n\nSo the 0s in rows9 and 10, columns3-6 are enclosed by 5s. Thus, they should be replaced by 2s.\n\nOther areas:\n\nIn row2, column8-9 are 5,5. row2, column10 is 5. But row2, column9 is 0. So column9 is 0. Let's see if that 0 is enclosed. Let's check row2, column9: 0. Its neighbors: left is 5 (column8), right is 5 (column10). Above is row1's column9:5. Below is row3's column9:0. So row3's column9:0. Let's track this. Row3, column9:0. Its neighbors: above (row2) is 0, below (row4) is 0. Left is 5 (column8), right is 5 (column10). So this 0 in row3, column9 is part of a vertical tunnel of 0s (rows2-4, column9) between 5s. Are these 0s enclosed? Let's see:\n\nRow2 column9:0. Above is row1 column9:5. Below is row3 column9:0. Row4 column9:0. Row5 column9:5 (since row5's columns8-11 are 5,5,5,0). So row5 column9 is 5. So the 0s in rows2-4 column9 are enclosed by 5s above (row1), below (row5), left (column8), right (column10). So this vertical strip of 0s is enclosed and should be replaced by 2s.\n\nSimilarly, row5's column10 is 5, but row5's column11 is 0. That 0 is connected to the right border (column11), so it remains 0.\n\nPutting this all together, the test input has several regions of 0s that are enclosed by 5s and should be replaced by 2s. The output should replace those regions.\n\nSo applying the pattern, the final output for the test input would replace the enclosed 0s with 2s. Let's try to write out the transformed rows.\n\nRow0: all 0s. No change.\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0]. The 0s here are in columns5-6 and 11. The 0s in columns5-6 are connected to row0's 0s, so remain 0. The 0 in column11 is part of the right border, so remains 0.\n\nRow2: [5,0\u21922,0\u21922,0\u21922,5,0,0,5,5,0\u21922,5,0]. So the 0s in columns1-3 and 9 become 2s.\n\nRow3: [5,0\u21922,0\u21922,0\u21922,5,0,0,5,0\u21922,0\u21922,5,0]. Columns1-3 and 8-9 become 2s.\n\nRow4: [5,0\u21922,0\u21922,0\u21922,5,0,0,5,0\u21922,0\u21922,5,0]. Same as row3.\n\nRow5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0]. The 0s are in columns5-6 and 11. Remain 0.\n\nRow6: all 0s. Connected to borders, no change.\n\nRow7: all 0s. No change.\n\nRow8: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0]. No 0s enclosed. All 0s are on the edges.\n\nRow9: [0,0,5,0\u21922,0\u21922,0\u21922,0\u21922,5,0,0,0,0]. Columns3-6 (0s) become 2s.\n\nRow10: [0,0,5,0\u21922,0\u21922,0\u21922,0\u21922,5,0,0,0,0]. Same as row9.\n\nRow11: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0]. No 0s enclosed.\n\nSo putting all these together, the output for the test input would have 2s in the enclosed regions described.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nLooking at the first example, the input has a lot of 5s forming some shapes. The output replaces some of the 0s inside those shapes with 2s. Like in row 3 of Example 0, the original was [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0...], and the output became [0, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0...]. So it looks like any 0 that's completely enclosed by 5s (like in a square) gets changed to 2. But how to define \"enclosed\"?\n\nIn Example 1, the input's row 2 is [0,5,5,0,5...], and the output changes that 0 to 2. Similarly, in other rows, 0s that are surrounded by 5s on all four sides (up, down, left, right) maybe? Wait, not exactly. Let me check another example.\n\nTake Example 2's input. The fifth row (index 4) of the input is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0]. The output changes the middle 0s to 2s. So in positions where the 0 is surrounded by 5s on top, bottom, left, and right? Wait, looking at that row, the 0s that became 2s are at positions 7 and 8 (assuming 0-based index). Wait, maybe it's the 0s that are in the interior of a rectangle formed by 5s. Like, if there's a loop of 5s, the 0s inside become 2s. So maybe the pattern is to fill enclosed areas.\n\nBut how to determine which 0s are enclosed. Like, in the input, if a 0 is completely surrounded by 5s in all four directions (up, down, left, right), then it's replaced by 2. Wait, let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the third row: [0,5,0,0,5...]. The two 0s in the middle are surrounded by 5s on the left and right (same row), and maybe above and below. Let's see the rows above and below. The row above (row 2) is [0,5,5,5,5,0...], so the 5s are in columns 1-4. The current row (row 3) has 5s at 1 and 4. The row below (row4) has 5s at 1 and 4 again. So the 0s in columns 2 and 3 of row3 are between 5s left and right, but maybe not vertically. Wait, but in the output, those 0s are replaced by 2s. Hmm. Maybe it's not requiring all four directions. Maybe it's a matter of being part of a region that's enclosed. Alternatively, perhaps it's filling the \"holes\" in the 5s structure. For example, if there's a loop of 5s forming a closed shape, the 0s inside get filled with 2.\n\nSo the pattern is: any 0 that is enclosed by 5s such that it's inside a closed loop of 5s (like the interior of a rectangle made of 5s) becomes 2. But how to detect that in the grid.\n\nAnother approach: look for 0s that are completely surrounded by 5s in all four directions (up, down, left, right). Wait, in Example 0's row3, the 0s are at positions 2 and 3. Looking at the cell (3,2) (assuming rows and columns are 0-based), the cell above (row2, column2) is 5, below (row4, column2) is 5. Left is 5 (column1), right is 0 (column3). Wait, that can't be. Because in row3, columns2 and3 are 0. For cell (3,2), left is 5 (row3, column1), right is 0 (row3, column3). So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the algorithm is to check if the cell is part of a 2x2 square of 0s surrounded by 5s. Let me check.\n\nIn Example0's row3 and row4: in row3, columns2 and3 are 0. In row4, columns2 and3 are 0. So that's a 2x2 block of 0s. And those are surrounded by 5s on all sides. So maybe any 0 that is part of a 2x2 block where all surrounding cells (including diagonally?) are 5s. But not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the output in Example0, the 0s in row3, columns2 and3 are replaced by 2s. Similarly, row4's 0s in those columns are replaced. So in the input, those 0s are part of a 2x2 block. So perhaps the rule is: any 0 that is part of a 2x2 block of 0s, surrounded by 5s on all four sides (left, right, top, bottom) becomes 2. But how to confirm this.\n\nLooking at Example1's output: in row2, column3, the 0 becomes a 2. Let's check the input here. The cell (2,3) is 0. The surrounding cells: left is 5 (row2, column2), right is 5 (row2, column4), top (row1, column3) is 5 (since row1 is [0,5,5,5,5,0...], column3 is 5). Bottom (row3, column3) is 5. So the 0 is surrounded by 5s on all four sides. So that's a single 0 cell, not part of a 2x2 block, but it's changed to 2. So that contradicts the previous idea. So maybe the rule is that any 0 that is completely enclosed by 5s in the four directions (up, down, left, right) becomes a 2. Let's check this.\n\nIn Example0's row3, column2: above is 5 (row2, column2), below is 5 (row4, column2?), wait row4 is [0,5,0,0,5,0...]. So row4, column2 is 0. So the cell (3,2) in the input is 0. The cells above (row2, col2) is 5. Below (row4, col2) is 0. So according to that, the cell (3,2) is not surrounded by 5s above and below. But in the output, it's replaced by 2. So that idea must be wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe the enclosing is not in all four directions. Maybe it's part of a region that is enclosed by 5s. For example, flood fill algorithm: any 0 that is not reachable from the grid's borders, considering 5s as walls, gets replaced by 2. That could be possible. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0's input, the 0s in row3 and row4, columns 2 and3: Are they connected to the border? The grid is 12x12. Let's imagine. The 0s in row3 are in columns 2-3. Are those 0s surrounded by 5s such that they form an enclosed area? If we can reach the edge of the grid via other 0s, then they are not enclosed. But maybe in the input, those 0s are part of an enclosed region. Let's see: in the input of example0, rows 2-5 have 5s forming a structure. The 0s in row3 and row4 (columns2-3) are in a sort of hollow square. Let me try to visualize. The 5s form a rectangle, and the 0s inside are surrounded by 5s. So if those 0s are enclosed, then they are replaced by 2s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1's input, the 0 in row2, column3 is inside a 5 structure. So if a 0 is enclosed by 5s such that it can't reach the grid's edge via adjacent 0s, then it's replaced by 2.\n\nYes, that seems plausible. So the transformation is to replace all 0s that are enclosed (i.e., part of a region not connected to the grid's border) by 2s.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n1. For the input grid, identify all 0 cells that are enclosed. Enclosed means they are not connected to the grid's border via adjacent 0s (including diagonally? Probably not, since adjacency is usually considered as 4-directional).\n\nWait, in flood fill, adjacency is typically 4-directional. So the process would be:\n\n- Mark all 0s that are reachable from the borders (i.e., 0s on the edge of the grid, and any 0 connected to them via up/down/left/right moves).\n\n- The remaining 0s (not reachable) are enclosed and are replaced with 2.\n\nYes, that's a common approach for detecting enclosed regions. For example, the problem is similar to the \"surrounded regions\" problem in programming, where O's that are surrounded by X's are replaced with X's, except those connected to the border.\n\nSo applying this here: all 0s that are not reachable from the grid's borders (via adjacent 0s) are turned into 2s.\n\nLet's verify this with the examples.\n\nTake Example0's input. The 0s that are turned into 2s are in the middle of 5 structures. For example, the ones in row3, columns2-3. Those 0s are surrounded by 5s and are not connected to the border. So they are replaced with 2.\n\nIn Example1's row2, column3, the 0 is surrounded by 5s. Since the 0 is not on the border and can't reach the border via 0s, it's replaced by 2.\n\nIn the test input, the 0s that are enclosed by 5s would be replaced by 2s. Let's look at the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow2: [5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow3: [5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nSo looking at rows1-5: they form a 5x5 square perhaps. The row2, columns1-3 are 0s. Are those enclosed? Let's see. The row1 is all 5s except for the 0s in columns5 and6. The row2 has 5s at start and end. So the 0s in row2 (columns1-3) are surrounded by 5s left and right (columns0 and4 are 5), but above (row1, columns1-3) are 5s. Below (row3, columns1-3) are 0s. Wait, so the 0s in row2, cols1-3 are connected to row3's 0s. So perhaps they form a larger region. But how do they connect to the border.\n\nLooking at the test input, the 0s in row1, columns5 and6 (values 0,0). Those 0s are on the edge (column5 and6 are in the middle, but row1 is not the first or last row. Wait, the rows are 12x12. So the test input's row indices 0-11.\n\nIn the test input, the first row (row0) is all 0s. So any 0 connected to row0's 0s would be part of the border-connected region.\n\nBut the 0s in rows1-5 (like row1, columns5 and6) are in the middle. Are they connected to the border?\n\nLet's see. The row1, column5 is 0. Let's check if this 0 can reach the border.\n\nRow0 is all 0s. So the 0s in row1, columns5 and6 (which are 0s) are adjacent (south) to row0's 0s. Wait, row1 is the second row (assuming 0-based), so row0 is the first. Wait, the test input's first row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Then row1 (second row) is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0]. So row1's columns5 and6 are 0. These are adjacent (down) to row0's columns5 and6, which are 0. So those 0s in row1 are connected to the border. Hence, any 0 connected to them is also part of the border-connected region.\n\nNow, looking at the 0s in the test input's rows2-4, columns1-3 (the 0s inside the 5 structure). Are they connected to the border via 0s?\n\nFor example, row2, column1 is 0. To reach the border, it would need to find a path of 0s to row0.\n\nBut in row2's 0s (columns1-3), they are surrounded by 5s except below (row3's columns1-3 are 0s). Row4's columns1-3 are 0s as well. So the 0s in rows2-4, columns1-3 form a vertical line. Are these connected to any border 0s?\n\nThe 0s in row2, column1: to reach the border, perhaps via row1's 0s. But row1's columns5 and6 are 0s. Are they connected? Let's see. The 0 in row1, column5 is connected to row0's column5, which is 0. Then, in row1, columns5 and6 are 0s. The 0s in row1 are in the middle of 5s. So to reach the 0s in row2's columns1-3, there must be a path of 0s connecting them.\n\nBut in row1, the 0s are at columns5 and6. How to get from row2's column1 to row1's column5. The path would need to go through 0s in adjacent cells.\n\nBut between row1's 0s (columns5-6) and row2's 0s (columns1-3), there's a gap filled with 5s. So the 0s in the 5 structure (rows2-4, columns1-3) are not connected to the border. Therefore, they are enclosed and should be replaced with 2s.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the test input's rows8-11. Rows8-11 form a structure similar to Example2's input. For example, row8: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0]. Rows9-10 have 5s with 0s in the middle. The 0s in rows9 and10, columns3-6 would be enclosed by 5s and thus replaced by 2s.\n\nWait, let's check rows9 and10:\n\nRow9: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow10: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo in these rows, the 0s at columns3-6 (positions 3,4,5,6) are between 5s. For example, row9, column3 is 0. Left is 5 (column2), right is 0 (column4). Wait, no. Wait row9's entries are: 0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0. So columns3-6 (indexes 3,4,5,6) are all 0. But the left of column3 is 5 (column2), and the right of column6 is 5 (column7). So those 0s form a horizontal line. Are they enclosed? For them to be enclosed, they must be surrounded by 5s on all four sides. But above and below may not be 5s.\n\nRow8 is [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0]. So the cells in row8, columns3-6 are 5s. The row9's 0s are below that. So the cells in row9, columns3-6 are 0s, with 5s above (row8), 5s to the left (column2) and right (column7). What about below? Row10's columns3-6 are 0s. Row11 is [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0]. So row11's columns3-6 are 5s again. So between row8 and row11, rows9-10 have 0s. So these 0s are surrounded by 5s above (row8) and below (row11), and left (column2) and right (column7). Therefore, those 0s are enclosed and should be replaced with 2s. \n\nSo in the test input, the enclosed 0s are:\n\n- The vertical line in rows2-4, columns1-3 (each cell in rows2,3,4, columns1-3 are 0s).\n\n- The horizontal lines in rows9-10, columns3-6.\n\nSo the output would replace these 0s with 2s.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nLooking at the first part (rows1-5):\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow2: [5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow3: [5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow5: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nIn rows2-4, columns1-3 (0-based), the cells are 0s. These are enclosed by 5s on the left (column0), right (column4), and above (row1, columns1-3 are 5s). Below, row5's columns1-3 are 5s. So these 0s are enclosed. So all these 0s become 2s.\n\nSo row2 becomes [5,2,2,2,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,0]\n\nWait, but in row2, columns5 and6 are 0s. But those are connected to the border via row1's columns5-6. So they remain 0.\n\nThen, rows3 and4, columns1-3 are replaced with 2s.\n\nIn the fifth row (row5), columns1-3 are 5s, so no change.\n\nNext, rows9-10:\n\nRow9: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow10: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe 0s in columns3-6 (positions 3-6) are between 5s on left (column2) and right (column7), and surrounded by 5s above (row8) and below (row11). So these 0s become 2s. So row9 becomes [0,0,5,2,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0]. Similarly for row10.\n\nPutting it all together, the output for the test input would have:\n\nRow2: [5,2,2,2,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow3: [5,2,2,2,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow4: [5,2,2,2,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow9: [0,0,5,2,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow10: [0,0,5,2,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nOther rows remain the same except for these changes.\n\nWait, but in the test input's rows6 and7 are all 0s, but they are connected to the border. So no changes there.\n\nNow, let's check the test input again. The test input's row6 is all 0s. Since it's row6, columns0-11 are 0. These are connected to row5 and row7. Row5's columns are 5s except for columns5-6 which are 0. So row6's 0s are connected to the border via row5's 0s? Wait, row5's columns5-6 are 0. So row5's columns5-6 are 0, which are connected to row6's 0s. And row6's 0s are connected to row7's 0s (since row7 is all 0s). So the 0s in rows5-7 are all connected to the border. So they remain 0.\n\nSo the only changes are in the enclosed areas: rows2-4 columns1-3, and rows9-10 columns3-6.\n\nSo the final output for the test input would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\n\n[5, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0]\n\n[5, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\n[5, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the pattern is replacing 0s that are enclosed (not reachable from the grid's border) with 2.",
