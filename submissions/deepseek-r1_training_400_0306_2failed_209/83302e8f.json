        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to identify the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by analyzing the training examples to figure out what transformation is happening from input to output.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nThe input consists of multiple rows with 0s and 8s. The output replaces some 0s with 3s, 4s, and leaves 8s as they are. Observing the output rows, it seems that the 3s and 4s are in blocks. For instance, the first few rows in the output have 3s, then there's a transition to 4s, and later some rows revert back to 3s. This might indicate that the transformation depends on the position of the row or some condition related to the presence of 8s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the input has 0s and 1s, and the output replaces 0s with 3s and 4s, keeping 1s intact. The pattern here also involves changing 0s to 3s and 4s in certain regions. \n\nExample 2 uses 0s and 9s. The output replaces 0s with 4s and 3s. Again, the 9s remain unchanged. \n\nA common observation across all examples is that the non-zero numbers (8,1,9 in examples) stay the same. The 0s are replaced by numbers (3,4) depending on their position relative to these non-zero elements. \n\nLooking closer at the structure, maybe the transformation is related to regions divided by the non-zero elements. For instance, in Example 0, the 8s might form a grid, and the regions between them are filled with 3s or 4s. The pattern alternates between 3 and 4 based on some rule, perhaps the row's position relative to a central line or whether the row is above or below a certain point.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the 3s and 4s are part of a checkerboard pattern or if they're grouped in quadrants. For example, in Example 0's output, the first four rows have 3s, then after a row of 8s, there's a switch to 4s, then back to 3s. This suggests that rows with 8s act as separators, and the regions between them alternate between 3 and 4. However, in the middle of the output, some rows have a mix. Wait, looking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe first four rows are all 3s except for the 8s. Then the fifth row is all 8s. Then rows 5-9 are 4s. Then the 10th row has 8s. Then rows 11-14 have 4s. The 15th row is a mix of 3s and 4s. This might indicate that whenever there's a row with a lot of 8s (maybe a horizontal line), the regions above and below alternate between 3 and 4. But the exact rule isn't immediately clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the vertical position relative to the first occurrence of a non-zero element in a row. For instance, if a 0 is to the left of the first 8 in a row, it becomes a 3, and to the right becomes a 4, but that doesn't fit all cases.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, the numbers 3 and 4 might represent quadrants. For example, in Example 0's output, rows 0-3 are 3s, rows 5-9 are 4s, then rows 15-18 have a mix. Maybe the grid is divided into four quadrants, and each quadrant is filled with 3 or 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be replacing 0s with 3s in certain regions and 4s in others, where the regions are determined by the presence of the non-zero elements acting as separators. For instance, the non-zero elements form a cross or a grid, splitting the array into sections, each assigned a different number.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the test input, which uses 5 as the non-zero element. The expected output would replace 0s with numbers (like 3 and 4, or perhaps new numbers) based on a similar pattern. Let's think about how the test input is structured. The input has rows with 0s and 5s. Following the pattern from the examples, the 5s would remain, and 0s would be replaced by other numbers based on their position.\n\nIn Example 0, the 8s form a grid. The output replaces 0s with 3s and 4s in different regions. Similarly, in Example 1, 1s are the grid, and 0s become 3s and 4s. So perhaps the pattern is that the non-zero elements (like 8,1,9,5) form a structure that divides the grid into regions, and each region is filled with a specific number (like 3 or 4) in the output. The key is to identify which regions get which number.\n\nLooking at the outputs, maybe the regions are determined by vertical and horizontal lines formed by the non-zero elements. For example, in Example 0, the 8s form vertical and horizontal lines, creating a grid. Each cell in the grid is filled with 3 or 4 based on its position relative to these lines. Perhaps the upper-left regions are 3s, lower-right are 4s, or some similar division.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers 3 and 4 might alternate in some way. For instance, every other region between the grid lines alternates between 3 and 4.\n\nBut how exactly? Let's take a specific example. In Example 0's input, the fifth row (index 4) is all 8s. The rows above it (0-3) in the output are 3s except for the 8s. The rows below (5-9) are 4s. Then after another 8 row (row 9?), maybe it alternates again. So the 8s act as horizontal dividers, and each horizontal band alternates between 3 and 4.\n\nBut looking at the output for Example 0, the rows after the first 8s (row 4) are rows 5-9 in the input, which in the output are 4s. Then row 10 is another 8 row, and the following rows (11-14) are 4s again. Wait, maybe the alternation happens when there's a horizontal line of 8s. So each time there's a horizontal line, the next region below switches from 3 to 4 or vice versa.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, after the first 8s (row4), rows5-9 are 4s. Then row10 is a mix, but not a full line. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of a horizontal line (row4) causes the regions above and below to switch.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical lines of 8s could split the array into vertical sections, each filled with 3 or 4. For example, looking at the first row of the input in Example0, there's an 8 at position 4, then again at 9, 14, 19, etc. So vertical lines at columns 4,9,14,19. Between these columns, the 0s are replaced with 3s or 4s. The output for the first row of Example0 is [3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,8,4,4,4,4,8,3,3,3,3]. So between columns 0-3 (before first 8 at 4), it's 3s. Then between 4 and 9 (columns 5-8?), but wait the next 8 is at position 9. So between 4 and 9, positions 5-8 are 3s. Then between 9 and 14 (columns 10-13), 3s. Then from 14 to 19 (columns 15-18), it's 4s, then after 19 (columns 20-23), 3s again. So the vertical regions alternate between 3 and 4. For example, first region (columns 0-4) is 3s up to the first 8, then between 8s (columns 4 to next 8 at 9) is 3s, but wait the first 8 is at index 4. So the regions between vertical 8s are filled with 3s except for the region between the third and fourth vertical 8 (positions 14 and 19), which is filled with 4s. So maybe the regions are numbered, and every third region is filled with 4 instead of 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical lines split the array into vertical bands, and the horizontal lines split into horizontal bands. Each cell is in a quadrant determined by these lines, and each quadrant is assigned a number. For instance, upper-left quadrant is 3, lower-right is 4, etc. But how to determine the quadrants.\n\nAnother approach: in Example0's output, the first four rows have 3s except where 8s are. Then rows 5-9 have 4s. Then row10 has 8s again. Then rows 11-14 have 4s. Then row15 starts with 3s again. So maybe the vertical and horizontal lines of 8s create a grid, and each cell in the grid is assigned 3 or 4 in a checkerboard pattern. For example, each region alternates between 3 and 4.\n\nBut how to determine which region is which. For example, the first region (top-left) is 3, then the next to the right is 3, then next is 3, then next is 4, then back to 3. Hmm. Alternatively, it's based on the parity of the row and column regions. For instance, if the vertical and horizontal bands are alternately colored 3 and 4 like a chessboard.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical lines split the array into columns. Each vertical band between two 8s is filled with 3 or 4, and alternates. For example, the first vertical band (left of first 8) is 3, then between first and second 8 is 3, then between second and third 8 is 3, then between third and fourth 8 is 4, and after the fourth 8 is 3 again. But in Example0's first output row, after the third 8 (position14), the next region (columns15-19) is 4s, then after that 3s. So maybe every third vertical band is 4, but that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical bands alternate between 3 and 4. For example, first band 3, second 3, third 3, fourth 4, fifth 3. But this doesn't fit a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the regions to the left of the first vertical 8 line are 3s, then between the first and second vertical 8 lines are 3s, then between second and third are 3s, between third and fourth are 4s, and after the fourth are 3s. This suggests that after a certain number of vertical 8 lines, the fill changes. But why?\n\nLooking back at the test input, the non-zero element is 5. The structure is similar: rows with 5s and 0s. The output should replace 0s with numbers, likely following the same pattern as the training examples. So 5s remain, and 0s become, say, 3 and 4 in different regions.\n\nIn the test input, the first few rows have 5s at positions 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23. So vertical lines at columns 3,7,11,15,19,23. The horizontal lines are rows where there are multiple 5s. For example, row3 is a horizontal line of 5s. Similarly, row7, row11, etc.\n\nAssuming the pattern from the examples, the regions between these vertical and horizontal lines would be filled with alternating numbers (like 3 and 4). For example, regions to the left of the first vertical line (column3) are 3s, between columns3-7 are 4s, between 7-11 3s, etc. But need to determine the alternation pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the regions could be split into quadrants. For instance, the first quadrant (top-left) is 3, then alternates as you cross vertical and horizontal lines. But the exact alternation is unclear.\n\nLooking at the training examples again, in Example0's output, the first four rows are filled with 3s except for 8s. Then after the horizontal line (row4), rows5-9 are 4s. Then another horizontal line (row9), rows10-14 are 4s. Wait, no. The output rows after row9 (row10) have some 4s and 8s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical bands alternate between 3 and 4, and the horizontal bands do the same. For example, each vertical band alternates between 3 and 4 as you move right, and each horizontal band alternates as you move down. So each cell's value depends on the combination of vertical and horizontal band parity.\n\nBut this might lead to a checkerboard pattern. For example, vertical bands: 3,3,3,4,3; horizontal bands: 3,3,3,3,8,4,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,8, etc. So when a new horizontal band starts (after a horizontal line), the fill number changes.\n\nAlternatively, after each horizontal line (row of all or many non-zeros), the fill number alternates. For example, before the first horizontal line, fill is 3; after, 4; then after the next horizontal line, back to 3, and so on.\n\nIn Example0, the first horizontal line is row4 (all 8s). The rows above (0-3) are 3s. Rows5-9 (after row4) are 4s. Then row9 is another horizontal line (mostly 8s?), and the rows after row9 (10-14) are 4s again. Then row14 is a horizontal line (all 8s?), and rows15-18 switch back to 3s. Wait, in Example0's output:\n\nRow14 in the input is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0]. The output for row14 is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4]. So row14 has a horizontal line of 8s but with some 0s converted to 4. Then row15 in output starts with 3s again. So after row14, the fill changes back to 3. So the alternation happens every time there's a horizontal line. So the rule is: when a horizontal line (many non-zeros) is encountered, toggle the fill number between 3 and 4. So regions between horizontal lines are filled with the current fill number, which toggles after each horizontal line.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1, after the horizontal line (row5, which is all 1s), the fill changes from 3 to 4. Then after another horizontal line (row11?), the fill might toggle again. Let's check Example1's output:\n\nRow5 in input is all 1s, and in output it's all 1s. Then row6 in output starts with 4s. So yes, after a horizontal line, the fill toggles. Then in row11, which has a horizontal line (input row11 is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1], output row11 is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,1,1]. So after this horizontal line (row11), the fill toggles again. So rows after row11 (like row12) start with 4s. Wait, in the output of Example1, after row5 (horizontal line), rows6-11 are 4s. Then after row11 (another horizontal line), rows12 and beyond are still 4s. But then in row17, there's a horizontal line, and rows after that (row18 onwards) start using 3 again. Hmm, maybe the fill toggles each time a horizontal line is encountered.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- The non-zero elements form horizontal and vertical lines that divide the grid into regions.\n- Each time a horizontal line (row with mostly non-zero elements) is encountered, the fill number toggles between 3 and 4.\n- The vertical lines (columns with non-zero elements) divide the grid into vertical bands, and each band alternates between fill numbers based on the horizontal region.\n\nWait, perhaps the fill number is determined by both the horizontal and vertical regions. For example, each horizontal band (between horizontal lines) has its own fill number (3 or 4), and within each horizontal band, the vertical bands (between vertical lines) alternate between the fill number and another number. But this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical lines split the grid into vertical regions, each of which is filled with the same number (3 or 4) based on the horizontal band's fill. For example, in a horizontal band with fill 3, all vertical regions are filled with 3. In the next horizontal band (after a horizontal line), fill is 4, so all vertical regions are 4. But in the training examples, this isn't the case. For instance, in Example0's output, the first horizontal band (rows0-3) has vertical regions filled with 3, then after the horizontal line (row4), the next horizontal band (rows5-9) has vertical regions filled with 4. Then after another horizontal line (row9), the next band (rows10-14) is filled with 4 again. Then after row14's horizontal line, rows15-18 are filled with 3. So the fill toggles every time a horizontal line is encountered. So the fill number starts as 3, then after the first horizontal line (row4), becomes 4. After the next horizontal line (row9), remains 4. Then after row14's horizontal line, toggles back to 3. So the toggle happens each time a horizontal line is encountered, regardless of where it is. But why did it stay 4 after row9?\n\nWait, in Example0's input, row9 is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. The output row9 is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. So this row is considered a horizontal line (since it has many 8s) and thus toggles the fill. But after row9, the fill becomes 4 again? Wait, no. Before row9, the fill was 4 (rows5-9). So after row9's horizontal line, the fill should toggle to 3. But looking at the output for row10: [4,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,4]. So the fill remains 4. This suggests that the toggle may not happen for every horizontal line, but perhaps only certain ones.\n\nHmm, perhaps the horizontal lines must be contiguous. Or maybe the fill only toggles when a horizontal line is fully composed of non-zeros. For example, in Example0's row4 is all 8s except for one 0. But row9 has some 0s. So maybe the rule is that a horizontal line is a row where all elements are non-zero except for some, but how to determine when it's considered a line.\n\nAlternatively, the fill toggles whenever a row contains at least a certain number of non-zero elements. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, the fill toggles when a row has a contiguous block of non-zero elements that spans most of the row, acting as a separator. For example, in Example0, row4 is mostly 8s, so it's a separator. Similarly, row14 in the input is mostly 8s. So each separator row toggles the fill.\n\nBut in Example0, after row4 (separator), fill becomes 4. Then after row9 (which is not a full separator, but has a lot of 8s), the fill remains 4. Then after row14 (separator), fill toggles to 3.\n\nSo perhaps the fill toggles only when the separator row is fully composed of non-zero elements (except possibly one). For example, in row4 of Example0, it's all 8s except for one 0. So maybe that counts as a separator, toggling the fill. Then row14's input is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0]. So two 0s. Maybe that's not enough to toggle, but in the output, after row14, the fill becomes 3. So perhaps any row with the non-zero element as the majority toggles the fill.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find another approach.\n\nAnother idea: the fill numbers (3,4) correspond to the layer or depth from the edges. For example, the outermost regions are 3, inner regions are 4. But this might not fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the fill numbers are based on the distance from the nearest non-zero element. But in the examples, the 0s are replaced with 3 or 4, which would require a different distance metric.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output: the first few rows have 3s, then after the horizontal line, they become 4s. Then after another horizontal line, they revert to 3s. So the fill number alternates every time a horizontal line is encountered, regardless of its content. So the rule is: the first region (before any horizontal line) is 3. After each horizontal line, the fill number toggles between 3 and 4. \n\nIn Example0's input:\n\n- The first horizontal line is row4 (mostly 8s). Toggle fill to 4.\n- The next horizontal line is row9 (many 8s, but not all). Toggle fill to 3.\n- Then row14 (another horizontal line). Toggle to 4.\n- Then row19 (all 8s). Toggle to 3.\n\nBut looking at the output, after row4, the fill is 4 (rows5-9). After row9, the fill remains 4 (rows10-14). So this contradicts the idea. So perhaps the horizontal lines only toggle the fill if they are completely filled with non-zero elements. Row4 is almost all 8s, but has one 0. Maybe that's not considered a full horizontal line, so the fill doesn't toggle. Wait, but in Example0's output, after row4, the fill does toggle from 3 to 4. So maybe even a partial horizontal line triggers the toggle.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of a non-zero element in every nth position defines a vertical separator, creating vertical bands, and horizontal separators create horizontal bands. The fill number alternates per band. For example, vertical bands alternate between 3 and 4, and horizontal bands also alternate, leading to a checkerboard pattern.\n\nBut in Example0's output, the vertical bands seem to have 3s and 4s in certain regions. For example, in the first row of output: [3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,8,4,4,4,4,8,3,3,3,3]. The vertical 8s are at positions4,9,14,19. The regions between them are filled with 3s except between 14 and 19, which is filled with 4s. This might suggest that the vertical bands alternate between 3 and 4 every certain number of bands. But why the third vertical band is 4.\n\nPerhaps the vertical bands alternate starting from a certain point. For example, the first three vertical bands are 3, then the fourth is 4, then back to 3. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the test input. The test input has 5s at columns3,7,11,15,19,23. The vertical separators are at these columns. The horizontal separators are rows3,7, etc. Maybe the fill number for each vertical band is determined by its position modulo some number. For example, every even-numbered vertical band is 3, odd is 4. But the positions are at columns3,7,11,... which are spaced 4 apart. So the vertical bands are of length4, then the 5s are at columns3,7 (so the first band is columns0-3, then3-7, etc. But how does this fit with the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, the fill number is determined by the count of vertical separators passed. For example, before the first vertical separator (column3), fill is 3. Between column3 and7, fill is 4. Between 7 and11, fill is3. etc., alternating. But in Example0's first row, between 4 and9 (assuming 8s are at 4,9,14,19), the fill is 3. Then between9 and14, 3. Between14 and19,4. So this doesn't fit an alternating pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical bands alternate every two separators. For example, the first two vertical bands are 3, next two are4, then repeat. But in Example0's output, there are three bands of 3, then a band of4, which doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Maybe there's another way. Let's think about the test input and how the output would look. The test input's vertical separators are at columns3,7,11,15,19,23. The horizontal separators are rows3,7, etc. \n\nAssuming that each time a horizontal line is encountered, the fill number toggles. So the first few rows (0-2) are fill3. Then row3 is a horizontal line (many 5s), so toggle to4. Rows4-6: fill4. Then row7 is a horizontal line, toggle to3. Rows8-10: fill3. Then row11 is a horizontal line, toggle to4. Rows12-14: fill4. Row15 is a horizontal line, toggle to3. And so on.\n\nBut how does this apply to the vertical bands? Maybe within each horizontal band, the vertical bands are filled with the current fill number. For example, in the first horizontal band (rows0-2, fill3), all vertical bands are 3. Then after row3 (horizontal line, toggle to4), vertical bands in rows4-6 are 4. But in the test input's row4, which is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0], the output would replace 0s with4 except for the 5s. So row4's output would be [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4].\n\nBut in the training examples, the vertical bands also have different fills. For example, in Example0's first row, the vertical bands alternate between 3 and4. So perhaps within each horizontal band, the vertical bands alternate between the current fill number and another number. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical bands are filled with the current fill number, except when a vertical separator is present. But the fill number is determined by the horizontal band's toggle. For example, in horizontal band 3, all vertical bands are 3. In horizontal band4, all vertical bands are4. But in Example0's output, this isn't the case.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to think of a different approach. Perhaps the pattern is that each cell's value is determined by the number of non-zero elements to its left and above. For example, if there's a non-zero element to the left, increment a counter, and similarly for above. Then use that to determine the fill number. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fill number is 3 for cells that are part of the left or upper part of the grid, and 4 for the right or lower part. For example, cells to the left of the center are 3, to the right are4. Or cells above a certain row are3, below are4.\n\nBut in Example0's output, the first few rows are3, then after a certain row, they become4. So maybe it's divided into upper and lower halves. But the transition happens at row4. The grid has 24 rows. So row4 is near the top. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: the fill numbers 3 and4 might represent layers. Each layer is enclosed by non-zero elements, and the layers are filled with alternating numbers. For example, the outermost layer is3, next layer4, next3, etc. But how to determine the layers.\n\nAlternatively, the fill numbers are determined by the minimum distance to the nearest non-zero element. For example, cells closer to non-zero elements are3, further away are4. But the training examples don't seem to support this.\n\nAlternatively, the fill numbers alternate based on the row's parity. For example, even-numbered rows are3, odd are4. But in Example0's output, rows0-3 are3, which are even and odd. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is challenging. Let's try to find a pattern in the output numbers. In Example0's output, the first row is [3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,8,4,4,4,4,8,3,3,3,3]. So after each 8, the fill changes. The first four elements are3, then 8, then four3s, 8, four3s, 8, then four4s, 8, then four3s. So the pattern is that after every third 8 in the row, the fill changes. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the fill changes after a certain number of vertical separators. For example, after the third vertical separator (column14), the fill becomes4. Then after the fourth (column19), back to3. So maybe the fill alternates every other vertical separator. For instance, first three vertical bands are3, then fourth is4, fifth is3.\n\nIn the test input, the vertical separators are at columns3,7,11,15,19,23. If the pattern is to change fill after every two vertical separators, then the first two vertical bands (0-3,3-7) are3, next two (7-11,11-15) are4, next two (15-19,19-23) are3, and beyond23 is4. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the fill changes after each vertical separator. So between column3 and7 is3, then7-11 is4, 11-15 is3, etc. Alternating every vertical band.\n\nBut how does this fit with Example0's first row. Vertical separators at4,9,14,19. So between4-9:3,9-14:3,14-19:4,19-24:3. So this would require an alternating pattern starting after the third vertical separator. Not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the fill number toggles every time a horizontal line is encountered, and within each horizontal band, the vertical bands are filled with the current fill number. But the vertical bands may also alternate.\n\nAlternatively, the fill number is determined by the horizontal band (toggle after each horizontal line) and the vertical band (toggle after each vertical separator). For example, each cell's fill is the current horizontal fill number XOR the vertical fill number, resulting in 3 or4.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to be certain.\n\nGiven the test input's structure, the vertical separators are at columns3,7,11,15,19,23. Let's assume that the fill number toggles after each horizontal line and each vertical separator. So for the test input:\n\n- Rows0-2: horizontal fill3. Vertical bands between separators are filled with3.\n- Row3 is a horizontal line (many5s), toggle to4.\n- Rows4-6: fill4. Vertical bands filled with4.\n- Row7 is a horizontal line, toggle to3.\n- Rows8-10: fill3.\n- Row11 is a horizontal line, toggle to4.\n- Rows12-14: fill4.\n- Row15 is a horizontal line, toggle to3.\n- Rows16-18: fill3.\n- Row19 is a horizontal line, toggle to4.\n- Rows20-22: fill4.\n- Row23 is a horizontal line, toggle to3.\n- Rows24-25: fill3.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't fit perfectly, but it's a start.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. For example, row0 in the test input is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. The horizontal fill before any horizontal line is3. So the 0s between vertical separators (columns0-3,3-7, etc.) would be filled with3. But after the first horizontal line (row3), the fill becomes4.\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the fill number is determined by the horizontal band. So rows0-3 are fill3. Row3 is a horizontal line, so rows4-... are fill4. Then row7 is a horizontal line, toggle back to3, etc.\n\nSo in the test input:\n\n- Rows0-2: fill3. Replace 0s with3, keep5s.\n- Row3 is a horizontal line (many5s), so fill toggles to4.\n- Rows4-6: fill4. Replace 0s with4.\n- Row7 is a horizontal line (many5s), toggle to3.\n- Rows8-10: fill3.\n- Row11 is a horizontal line (many5s), toggle to4.\n- Rows12-14: fill4.\n- Row15 is a horizontal line (many5s), toggle to3.\n- Rows16-18: fill3.\n- Row19 is a horizontal line (many5s), toggle to4.\n- Rows20-22: fill4.\n- Row23 is a horizontal line, toggle to3.\n- Rows24-25: fill3.\n\nBut also, the vertical separators (columns with5s) may affect the fill. For example, if within a horizontal band, the vertical bands alternate between fill and another number, but this is unclear.\n\nHowever, given that in the training examples, the fill number applies to entire horizontal bands, regardless of vertical separators, perhaps the test input's output will have horizontal bands filled with 3 or4, changing each time a horizontal line is encountered.\n\nFor example, the first few rows (0-2) are fill3. Then row3 is a horizontal line (many5s), so rows4-6 are fill4. Then row7 is a horizontal line, rows8-10 are fill3. Row11 is a horizontal line, rows12-14 fill4. Row15 horizontal line, rows16-18 fill3. Row19 horizontal line, rows20-22 fill4. Row23 horizontal line, rows24-25 fill3.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] becomes [3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3]\n\nRow1: same as row0.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] becomes [3,3,3,5,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3]\n\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0] becomes [5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0]. But since it's a horizontal line, the fill toggles to4 for the next rows.\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] becomes [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] becomes [4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] becomes [4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4]\n\nRow7: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5] becomes [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]. This is a horizontal line, so the fill toggles to3 for the next rows.\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] becomes [3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3]\n\nAnd so on, alternating fill numbers each time a horizontal line is encountered.\n\nBut in Example0's output, after row4 (horizontal line), the fill toggles to4, and after row9 (another horizontal line), the fill remains4. Then after row14 (horizontal line), toggles to3. So it's possible that each horizontal line toggles the fill, regardless of whether it's a full line or not.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nEach time a row with a horizontal line (many5s) is encountered, the fill toggles. The fill starts as3, then toggles to4 after row3, then to3 after row7, then to4 after row11, etc.\n\nThus, the output would have alternating bands of 3 and4 based on the horizontal separators. The vertical separators (columns with5s) are kept as5, and the 0s in between are replaced with the current fill number.\n\nTherefore, the test input's output will have rows alternating between 3 and4 as the fill number after each horizontal line. Each row's 0s are replaced with the current fill number, and 5s remain.\n\nFor example, row0-2: fill3.\n\nRow3: toggles fill to4.\n\nRows4-6: fill4.\n\nRow7: toggles to3.\n\nRows8-10: fill3.\n\nRow11: toggles to4.\n\nRows12-14: fill4.\n\nRow15: toggles to3.\n\nRows16-18: fill3.\n\nRow19: toggles to4.\n\nRows20-22: fill4.\n\nRow23: toggles to3.\n\nRows24-25: fill3.\n\nEach 0 in these rows is replaced with the current fill number.\n\nNow, checking the test input's rows:\n\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0] \u2192 output is same as input except 0s become4 (since next rows are fill4). But in the output, the 0s here are replaced with4, and the row acts as a separator, toggling the fill. So output row3 would be [5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4].\n\nRow7: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5] \u2192 replace the 0 with3 (since the next fill is3). But wait, row7 is a horizontal line. So the current fill before row7 is4 (rows4-6). When row7 is processed, the fill toggles to3. So row7's 0 becomes3, and the rest are5s. So output row7: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5].\n\nRow11: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5] \u2192 this is a horizontal line? It has many5s but some0s. The fill would toggle after this row. The 0s in row11 would be replaced with3 (current fill before row11 is3), and then the next rows toggle to4. So row11's output: [5,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5,3,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5].\n\nRow15: [5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5] \u2192 current fill is4 (rows12-14). After row15 (horizontal line), toggle to3. So 0s in row15 become4, and rest are5s. Output row15: [5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5].\n\nRow19: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5] \u2192 current fill is3 (rows16-18). Toggle to4. So 0 becomes3. Output row19: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,5].\n\nRow23: [5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5] \u2192 current fill is4 (rows20-22). Toggle to3. So 0s become4. Output row23: [5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5].\n\nRows24-25: fill3.\n\nPutting this all together, each row's 0s are replaced with the current fill number (3 or4), which toggles after each horizontal line.\n\nThus, the final answer should be each row of the test input with 0s replaced by3 or4 based on the current fill number, which toggles after each horizontal line.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of numbers, and the output seems to modify some of them. Let me start by comparing the input and output of the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has a lot of 0s and 8s. The output replaces some 0s with 3s or 4s. For instance, the first few lines in the input are all [0,0,0,0,8,...], and the output starts with [3,3,3,3,8,...]. Then later, there are lines where 0s become 4s. So maybe the 0s are being changed based on their position or some other condition.\n\nLooking at the rows, perhaps the transformation depends on whether the row is above or below a certain point. The fifth row in the input (0-based index 4) is all 8s except a 0 in the 17th position. The output for that row has an 8 in most positions except the 17th, which is 0 in the input but becomes 4 in the output. Wait, no\u2014the input row 4 has a 0 at position 17, and the output has 4 there. So maybe the rows after a certain point are being converted to 4s, and others to 3s.\n\nLooking at the first four rows of the input in Example 0, they all become 3s except for the 8s. Then, the fifth row (index 4) has mostly 8s, but the 0 becomes 4. Then the next few rows (starting at index 5) have 0s turned into 4s. Then later rows switch back to 3s again. Hmm, maybe the direction changes based on the presence of a certain row. Like, when there's a row that's mostly 8s (like the fifth row), the rows below it start using 4s, and the rows above use 3s. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers 3 and 4 are replacing 0s in certain regions. For example, in Example 0, the first four rows and the last four rows (after row 19) use 3s for 0s, while the middle rows use 4s. The 8s remain unchanged. So the pattern might be dividing the input into sections where 0s are replaced with 3 or 4 based on their vertical position relative to some key rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 0s and 1s. The output replaces some 0s with 3s, 4s. The first five rows (indices 0-4) have 0s turned into 3s. Then, starting from row 5 (the all-1 row), the next rows (6 onwards) use 4s. Then, later rows (like row 30) start using 3 again but mixed with 4s. Wait, looking at Example 1's output, after the all-1 row (index 5), rows 6-17 have 4s, then rows 18 and below start mixing 3s and 4s. For example, row 18 in the input is [0,0,0,0,0,1...], and the output starts with 4s but then has some 3s. So maybe there's a vertical division where after a certain key row (like the all-special number row), the replacement number changes.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 0s and 9s. The output uses 4s and 3s. The first few rows have 4s replacing 0s, then later rows (like row 10) switch to 3s. The key might be the presence of the all-9 row (row 4) which is in the middle. So rows before that use 4s, and after that use 3s, but maybe with some exceptions.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern might be:\n\n- The input is a grid where certain rows are \"dividers\" (like rows filled with the special number, e.g., 8,1,9).\n- The rows above the divider use one replacement number (like 3), rows below use another (like 4), but there might be some exceptions when another divider is encountered.\n- The replacement number (3 or 4) alternates based on the position relative to the dividers.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the first divider is row 4 (all 8s except one 0). The rows before row 4 use 3s, rows after use 4s. Then later in the output, there's another divider (row 14) which is all 8s. So perhaps after that, rows below use 3 again? Looking at row 15 in the output, which starts with 3s again. So maybe each time a divider row (with the special number) is encountered, the replacement number toggles between 3 and 4.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, rows 0-3 are 3s, then rows 5-14 (after the first divider) are 4s. Then row 15 switches back to 3s. But the divider row 19 is all 8s. So perhaps the toggle happens after each divider. So the replacement number alternates each time a divider row is encountered.\n\nLet me check Example 1. The first divider is row 5 (all 1s). Before that, rows use 3s. Then after, rows use 4s. Then another divider row (row 17) which has some 1s and 0s. Wait, the input row 17 is [1,1,1,...1,0,1...]. The output for row 17 is [1,1,1...4,1...]. So maybe the divider rows are the ones that are mostly the special number (like 1) and have some 0s. Then after that divider, the replacement number toggles again. In Example 1's output, after row 17 (the divider), the next rows start mixing 4 and 3. For example, row 18 in the input is [0,0,0,0,0,1...], and the output starts with 4, then has 3s. So perhaps after the second divider (row 17), the replacement number toggles back to 3, but the exact pattern might be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number is 3 for the upper sections and 4 for lower sections, but when a divider is encountered, the replacement number switches. So each divider row acts as a boundary, flipping the replacement from 3 to 4 or vice versa.\n\nIn Example 0, the first divider (row 4) is followed by rows with 4s. Then another divider (row 14) which is all 8s except one 0. After that, the replacement toggles back to 3. Then the last divider (row 19) is all 8s, which might toggle again to 4, but the rows after that are 3s again. Hmm, maybe it's not a strict toggle but depends on the position relative to the first divider. Maybe the first divider splits the grid into upper and lower parts, with upper being 3 and lower 4. Then another divider in the lower part could split further, but maybe the initial split is the main one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number is determined by how many dividers have been encountered above the current row. For example, if even number of dividers above, use 3; if odd, use 4. Or vice versa.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input: the first divider is row 4. Then row 14 is another divider. So rows before row 4: 0 dividers, replacement 3. Rows between 4 and 14: 1 divider, replacement 4. Rows after 14: 2 dividers, maybe back to 3. Then row 19 is another divider (3rd?), so maybe replacement flips again. But looking at the output, rows 15-18 have 3s, row 19 is all 8s, then rows 20-23 use 3s again. So the count of dividers before the current row might determine the replacement. If even, use 3; odd, use 4. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow 0-3: 0 dividers before \u2192 3.\n\nRow 4 is a divider.\n\nRow 5-14: 1 divider before \u2192 4.\n\nRow 15-18: after row 14 (second divider), so 2 dividers \u2192 3.\n\nRow 19 is a divider (third), so rows after would be 4. But rows 20-23 are after row 19, but in the output, they use 3s. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe that approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement number depends on whether the row is above or below the first divider. Let's see in Example 0: the first divider is row 4. Rows above (0-3) use 3s. Rows below (5-23) use 4s, but some rows (like 15-18) switch back to 3. That contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number alternates each time a divider is encountered. For example, the first section (before first divider) uses 3. After the first divider, uses 4. After the next divider, uses 3 again. And so on.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nFirst divider at row 4. So rows 0-3: 3. Rows 5-14: 4. Then next divider at row 14. Rows after (15-19): 3. Then next divider at row 19. Rows after (20-23): 4. But looking at the output:\n\nRow 15 in output starts with 3, then some 8s and 4. Hmm, maybe not. Because in Example 0's output, row 15 is:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n\nThis mixes 3 and 4. So perhaps it's more complex. Maybe it's not per row, but per cell, based on proximity to the special number (8 in this case).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement numbers (3 and 4) are determined by the horizontal position relative to the special number. For example, to the left of the 8s are 3s and to the right are 4s. But in Example 0's input, each row has 8s in column 4, 9, 14, 19. In the output, the 0s before the first 8 are replaced with 3s, and after the last 8, replaced with 4s? Let's check:\n\nLooking at the first input row in Example 0: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]. The output is [3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,8,4,4,4,4,8,3,3,3,3]. So before the first 8 (columns 0-3): 3. Between the 8s (columns 5-8): 3. After the fourth 8 (columns 15-18): 4. Then after the fifth 8 (columns 20-23): 3 again. So maybe the replacement number alternates based on the position relative to the 8s. Like, between 8s, the 0s are replaced with 3, and after the last 8 in a row, the 0s are replaced with 4. But in this case, the first 8 is at position 4. Then positions before are 3, between 8s (positions 5-9) are 3. Then after the fourth 8 (position 19), positions 15-18 are 4, and after that (positions 20-23) are 3 again. That doesn't fit a simple left-right split.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each group of 0s between two 8s is replaced with 3, and the trailing 0s after the last 8 in the row are replaced with 4. Let's check:\n\nIn the first output row of Example 0, after the first 8 (position 4), there are 0s replaced with 3 until the next 8 (position 9). Then again 3s until the next 8 (position14). Then after the 8 at position19, the following 0s (positions 15-18) are 4. Wait, but positions 15-18 are before the 8 at position19. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the 0s after the last 8 in a row are replaced with 4. Let's see: the input row 0 has 8s at positions 4,9,14,19. The last 8 is at position19. The trailing 0s after position19 (positions20-23) are replaced with 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement depends on the vertical position relative to the divider rows. Let's think again about the divider rows. Each example has some rows that are filled with the special number (like 8,1,9) except possibly some 0s. These divider rows might split the grid into sections. For example, in Example 0, rows 4, 14, 19 are divider rows. The first divider (row4) splits the grid into upper and lower. The upper part (rows0-3) use 3s. The lower part (rows5-14) use 4s. Then the next divider (row14) might split again, so rows15-18 use 3s. Then row19 is another divider, so rows20-23 use 3s again (but they are in the output as 3s). Hmm, this might not explain all cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each divider row changes the replacement number. For example, the first time a divider is encountered, the replacement changes from 3 to 4. The next time, it changes back to 3, and so on. So in Example 0:\n\n- Before any divider (rows0-3): 3.\n\n- After first divider (row4), rows5-14: 4.\n\n- After second divider (row14), rows15-19: 3.\n\n- After third divider (row19), rows20-23: 4.\n\nBut looking at the output, rows20-23 are 3s. So that doesn't fit. Maybe the replacement toggles with each divider, but in Example0, after row14, it toggles back to 3, which is what the output shows (rows15-19 are 3s). Then after row19 (third divider), it toggles again to 4, but rows20-23 are 3s. So that's inconsistent.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at the output in Example0:\n\nRows0-3: all 0s replaced with 3.\n\nRow4: mostly 8s, the 0 in position17 becomes 4.\n\nRows5-14: 0s replaced with 4.\n\nRow15-18: 0s replaced with 3 again.\n\nRow19: all 8s.\n\nRows20-23: 0s replaced with 3.\n\nSo maybe the replacement number depends on whether the row is above or below a certain middle divider. For instance, if the grid has an odd number of rows, the middle row is the divider, and rows above use 3, rows below use4. But Example0 has 24 rows (input has 23 rows?), perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number is determined by the vertical position modulo some number. For example, every other section uses 3 or 4. But that's vague.\n\nWait, in Example1, the output starts with 3s, then after the divider (all1s row), uses4s, then after another divider, mixes 4 and3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number is 3 for even-numbered sections and 4 for odd-numbered sections, where sections are divided by divider rows.\n\nAnother idea: the replacement number changes each time a divider row is encountered. For example, the first section (before any dividers) uses 3. After the first divider, use 4. After the next divider, use 3 again. So each divider toggles the replacement number.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nDividers at rows4, 14, 19.\n\n- Before row4: 3.\n\n- Row4 is a divider \u2192 next section uses4.\n\n- Rows5-14: 4.\n\n- Row14 is a divider \u2192 next section uses3.\n\n- Rows15-19:3.\n\n- Row19 is a divider \u2192 next section uses4.\n\n- Rows20-23:4? But in the output, rows20-23 are 3s. So this doesn't fit. So perhaps this isn't the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is 3 for the upper half and 4 for the lower half, based on the first divider. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, the first divider is row4 (index4). So the upper part is rows0-3 (3s), lower part rows5-23 (4s). But in the output, rows15-18 are 3s again. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at the output for Example0's row15: [3,3,3,3,8,4,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,8,3,3,3,3,8,4,4,4,4]. This row has a mix of 3s and 4s. So maybe it's not a simple row-based replacement.\n\nAlternative approach: look at individual cells. For each cell in the input, if the cell is 0, replace it with 3 or 4 based on some condition. The special numbers (like 8,1,9) remain the same.\n\nLooking at Example0's input row0: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row0: [3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,8,4,4,4,4,8,3,3,3,3]\n\nNotice that the 0s before the fourth 8 (at position14) are replaced with 3, then the next four 0s (positions15-18) are replaced with4, then after the fifth 8 (position19), the 0s are replaced with3 again.\n\nSo perhaps each group of 0s between 8s is replaced with 3, and the trailing 0s after the last 8 are replaced with4. But in this row, there are 8s at positions4,9,14,19. The 0s between them are replaced with3. The 0s after the last 8 (positions20-23) are replaced with3. Wait, but in the output, the 0s after position19 are replaced with3, which contradicts the idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s in the first half of the row are replaced with3, and the second half with4. For example, the row has 24 elements. The first 12 are replaced with3, the next 12 with4. But looking at output row0, positions0-14 are replaced with3, then 15-18 with4, then 20-23 with3. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement depends on the horizontal position relative to the 8s. For example, between the 8s, 0s are 3s, and after the last 8, 0s are 4s. But in row0, there are 8s at positions4,9,14,19. The 0s between them are 3s, and after position19 (positions20-23) are 3s again. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's look for other patterns. In the output of Example0, the 0s in row4 (the divider row) are replaced with4. Similarly, in Example1's divider row (row5), the 0s are replaced with1. Wait, no, the input row5 in Example1 is all 1s, so output is same. But the rows after that, like row6, have 0s replaced with4.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the special number (8,1,9,5 in test input) remains unchanged. So the transformation is only applied to 0s.\n\nNow, looking at Example0's output row0:\n\nInput 0s: positions0-3,5-8,10-13,15-18,20-23.\n\nOutput: positions0-3\u21923,5-8\u21923,10-13\u21923,15-18\u21924,20-23\u21923.\n\nSo what's different about the 15-18 positions? They are between the third and fourth 8s (positions14 and19). Wait, the third 8 is at14, then next at19. The 0s between 14 and19 are positions15-18. But in the output, those 0s are replaced with4. So maybe after the third 8 in a row, the next group of 0s is replaced with4, then after the fourth 8, back to3. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement alternates between 3 and4 for each group of 0s between the special numbers. Like:\n\nGroup1 (before first 8): 3.\n\nGroup2 (between first and second 8):3.\n\nGroup3 (between second and third 8):3.\n\nGroup4 (between third and fourth 8):4.\n\nGroup5 (after fourth 8):3.\n\nBut why group4 is 4? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the number of groups in a row determines the replacement. If the row has an even number of 8s, then the last group is4. If odd, then last group is3. But in Example0's row0, there are four 8s. The last group (after fourth 8) is replaced with3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement for the groups alternates between 3 and4. Like first group:3, second:3, third:3, fourth:4, fifth:3. Doesn't seem like a pattern.\n\nThis approach might not be working. Let's think of another angle.\n\nLooking at the test input. The special number is5. Each row has 5s in certain positions. The output should replace 0s with either3 or4 based on the same pattern as the examples.\n\nThe test input's first row is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,...]. The expected output would replace 0s with3 or4. Looking at the examples, maybe rows are divided into sections based on divider rows (rows with 5s mostly), and the replacement number depends on whether the row is above or below these dividers.\n\nIn the test input, there's a row (index3) that is [5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0]. This might be a divider row. The rows before this (indices0-2) would use3, and after (indices4 onwards) use4. Then there's another divider row (index7) which is [5,5,...5,0,5,...], which might toggle the replacement back to3.\n\nAlternatively, each time a divider row is encountered, the replacement toggles between3 and4. So:\n\n- Before any dividers:3.\n\n- After first divider (row3):4.\n\n- After second divider (row7):3.\n\n- After third divider (row19):4.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the test input has divider rows at indices3,7,19, etc.\n\nIn the test input, the first divider is row3. Rows before (0-2) would be replaced with3. Rows after (4-6,8-18,20-25) would be replaced with4, then after the next divider (row7), rows8-18 would toggle back to3. Then after row19 (divider), rows20-25 would toggle to4.\n\nBut how to confirm?\n\nLooking at the first example's output for divider rows: the divider rows in the input are modified to have their 0s replaced with the replacement number. For example, in Example0's row4 (input has a 0 at position17), the output is 4 there. So the divider rows themselves are part of the replacement.\n\nIf the test input's row3 is a divider, then the 0s in row3 would be replaced with4 (assuming that the first replacement after the first divider is4).\n\nIn the test input's row3, there are two 0s at positions6 and26. The output would replace them with4.\n\nThen rows after row3 (indices4-25) would use4 for 0s. But there's another divider at row7. So after row7, the replacement toggles back to3. Then after row19 (another divider), toggles to4.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's try applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input has rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 before any divider, replace 0s with3.\n\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0] \u2192 this is the first divider. The 0s here would be replaced with4.\n\nRows4-6: after first divider, replace 0s with4.\n\nThen row7 is a divider, so after that (rows8-18) replace 0s with3.\n\nRow19 is a divider, so after that (rows20-25) replace with4.\n\nBut need to check if this matches the examples.\n\nIn Example1, the first divider is row5 (all1s). Rows before:3. Rows after:4. Then another divider at row17, so rows after that:3.\n\nLooking at the output of Example1's row18: [4,4,4,4,4,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,4,4,4]. This row is after the divider row17. So after row17, the replacement number is3, but only for certain positions. Hmm, maybe the toggling is not for entire rows but for specific regions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number depends on the vertical position relative to the nearest divider above. For example, if a row is after an odd number of dividers, use4; even, use3.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow0-3:0 dividers above \u21923.\n\nRow4: divider itself \u2192 replaced with4 (but only the 0 in it).\n\nRows5-14: after 1 divider \u21924.\n\nRows15-18: after 2 dividers (rows4 and14) \u21923.\n\nRow19: after 3 dividers \u21924.\n\nRows20-23: after 3 dividers \u21924. But in the output, they are3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of dividers before the row modulo 2 determines the replacement. For even count, 3; odd,4.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow0-3:0 dividers \u2192 even \u21923.\n\nRow4: divider itself, but it's part of the count for the next rows.\n\nRow5-14:1 divider before \u2192 odd \u21924.\n\nRows15-18:2 dividers before \u2192 even \u21923.\n\nRow19:3 dividers before \u2192 odd \u21924.\n\nRow20-23:4 dividers before \u2192 even \u21923.\n\nBut looking at the output:\n\nRow15:3s \u2192 correct (2 dividers before).\n\nRow20:3s \u2192 correct (4 dividers before, even).\n\nThis seems to fit. Let's check Example1.\n\nExample1's first divider is row5 (all1s). Count for row6:1 \u21924.\n\nRow17 is another divider. So rows after row17 (rows18-27) would have count2 \u21923.\n\nBut in the output, row18 has 4s and3s. Hmm, maybe the divider row is counted as part of the previous section. Like, rows after the divider are considered under the new count.\n\nAlternatively, the count is the number of dividers strictly before the row.\n\nRow0-4:0 dividers \u21923.\n\nRow5: divider \u2192 rows after row5 count as1.\n\nRow17: divider \u2192 rows after row17 count as2.\n\nSo rows18-27:2 dividers \u21923.\n\nIn the output of Example1, row18 is [4,4,4,4,4,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,4,4,4]. The replacement starts with4 but then has3s. So this approach may not work.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the replacement numbers in the examples, 3 and4 are used. Noting that3 and4 are consecutive numbers. Maybe they alternate based on some condition.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0's output, the first four rows are all 3s. Then rows5-14 are 4s. Then rows15-18 are3s again. Then row19 is all 8s, and rows20-23 are3s. So the pattern is 3 \u21924 \u21923 \u21923. Not a simple alternation.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number depends on the row's position relative to the first and last divider rows. For example, rows before the first divider:3, rows between first and last divider:4, rows after last divider:3.\n\nIn Example0, first divider row4, last divider row19. So rows0-3:3; rows5-19:4; rows20-23:3. But in the output, rows5-14 are4, rows15-18 are3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is3 in the top and bottom thirds of the grid, and4 in the middle. But the number of rows varies between examples.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to look for another commonality between the examples.\n\nIn all examples, the output seems to have the 0s replaced with3 or4 in such a way that the replacement numbers form blocks or regions. The 3s are often at the top and bottom, and4s in the middle. For example:\n\n- Example0: 3s at top (rows0-3), 4s in middle (5-14), 3s again (15-18), then 3s at bottom (20-23).\n\n- Example1: 3s at top (0-4), 4s in middle (6-17), then a mix of3 and4 towards the bottom.\n\n- Example2:4s in the upper half,3s in lower.\n\nPerhaps the replacement numbers are determined by the vertical proximity to the nearest divider row. If a row is closer to the top divider, it's3; closer to a bottom divider, it's4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grid is divided into vertical bands. For example, in Example0, the left part uses3 and the right part uses4. But the output row0 has3s on the left, then4s in the middle, then3s again. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the replacement number is3 for even-numbered occurrences of the special number in the row, and4 for odd-numbered. For example, the first group of 0s before the first special number is3, between first and second special number is3, between second and third is3, between third and fourth is4, etc. Let's check Example0's row0:\n\nSpecial numbers at positions4,9,14,19. The groups are:\n\n- Before4:3.\n\n- Between4-9:3.\n\n- Between9-14:3.\n\n- Between14-19:4.\n\n- After19:3.\n\nThis seems arbitrary. Why between 14-19 is4? Maybe based on the number of groups. If there are even number of groups, the last one is4. But here, four groups (if we count after last as a group). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement alternates between3 and4 every two groups. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nMaybe it's time to look for the simplest pattern that fits all examples.\n\nObserving that in the examples, the replacement number for 0s is3 in the first few and last few rows, and4 in the middle rows. So it's like a sandwich: 3-4-3. But how to determine where the splits are.\n\nIn Example0, the split points are after row3 (first split) and before row15 (second split). So:\n\n- Rows0-3:3.\n\n- Rows4-14:4.\n\n- Rows15-23:3.\n\nBut row4 is a divider and has a4. So perhaps the split is after the first divider.\n\nAnother observation: the number of 3 and4 regions seems to correlate with the number of divider rows. For instance, Example0 has three divider rows, leading to three regions:3,4,3.\n\nExample1 has two divider rows, leading to regions3,4,3.\n\nExample2 has two dividers, leading to regions4,3.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is: every time a divider row is encountered, the replacement number alternates between3 and4. The first region (before any divider) is3. After each divider, the replacement flips.\n\nSo:\n\n- Before first divider:3.\n\n- After first divider:4.\n\n- After second divider:3.\n\n- After third divider:4.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nLet's test this against Example0:\n\nDividers at rows4,14,19.\n\n- Rows0-3:3.\n\n- Rows4-14:4 (after first divider).\n\n- Rows15-19:3 (after second divider).\n\n- Rows20-23:4 (after third divider).\n\nBut in Example0's output, rows20-23 are3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is3 in regions that are above the first divider and below the last divider, and4 in between.\n\nIn Example0:\n\n- First divider at row4, last at row19.\n\n- Rows0-3:3.\n\n- Rows5-19:4.\n\n- Rows20-23:3.\n\nBut in the output, rows15-18 are3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input, the special number is5. Let's see if the output can be predicted based on the previous examples' patterns.\n\nAssuming that in each row, the 0s are replaced with3 or4 based on their position relative to the 5s in that row.\n\nFor example, the first row of the test input is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0].\n\nIn the output, perhaps the 0s before the first5 are3s, between5s are3s, and after the last5 are4s.\n\nSo the first5 is at position3. 0s before:3. Between5s (positions4-7) are3. Next between5s (positions8-11) are3. And so on. After the last5 (position23), the 0s are4.\n\nBut looking at the first example's output row0, which has four 8s. The 0s after the last8 are replaced with3, which contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the last group of0s in each row is replaced with4, and others with3.\n\nIn the test input's first row, the last group of0s is after the last5 (positions24-26). So replace those with4, others with3.\n\nBut how does this fit with Example0's row0? The last group of0s in row0 is after the fourth8 (position19), which are replaced with3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the first N groups of0s are replaced with3, and the remaining with4. For example, if a row has four groups of0s, the first three are3, last one4.\n\nIn Example0's row0, there are five groups of0s:\n\n- Before first8 (0-3):3.\n\n- Between8s (5-8,10-13,15-18):3,3,4.\n\n- After last8 (20-23):3.\n\nSo this doesn't fit.\n\nPerhaps the number of groups of0s in a row determines the replacement. For example, even-numbered groups are3, odd-numbered are4. But in Example0's row0, group1 (0-3):3, group2 (5-8):3, group3 (10-13):3, group4 (15-18):4, group5 (20-23):3. This doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: in each row, the replacement alternates between3 and4 for each group of0s. For example, first group3, second3, third3, fourth4, fifth3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number depends on the position of the group in the row. For example, groups before the middle of the row are3, after are4. But that would depend on the row's length.\n\nIn Example0's row0, the middle is at position11.5. The groups:\n\n- Positions0-3 (before first8):3.\n\n- 5-8 (after first8):3.\n\n- 10-13 (after second8):3.\n\n- 15-18 (after third8):4.\n\n- 20-23 (after fourth8):3.\n\nThis doesn't align with the middle.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of the simplest possible pattern that fits all examples.\n\nAlternative hypothesis:\n\nThe 0s are replaced with3 if they are in an even-numbered section (divided by divider rows), and4 if in an odd-numbered section. The sections are divided by rows that contain the special number (not necessarily all, but a certain number).\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is3 for the first occurrence of each group of rows separated by divider rows, and4 for the next, etc.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's think of the test input's first row and predict based on the examples.\n\nIn Example0's first row, the first four groups of0s are replaced with3, then the fifth group with4, then back to3. So perhaps the replacement number is3 for the first three groups, then4 for the fourth, then3 again.\n\nBut why? It's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is3 except for the group of0s that is followed by a special number at the end of the row, which becomes4. For example, in Example0's row0, the group before the fourth8 (positions15-18) is replaced with4, then after the fourth8 it's3. But why this group?\n\nAnother angle: the replacement number is determined by the number of special numbers to the left in the row. For example, after the third special number, the replacement becomes4. So in a row with four special numbers, the 0s after the third are4, others are3.\n\nIn Example0's row0:\n\n- Before first8 (0-3):3.\n\n- Between first and second8 (5-8):3.\n\n- Between second and third8 (10-13):3.\n\n- Between third and fourth8 (15-18):4.\n\n- After fourth8 (20-23):3.\n\nThis matches. So the pattern is: in a row, after the third occurrence of the special number, the 0s are replaced with4. Other 0s are3.\n\nBut in Example1's row0, the output is [3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,...]. The row has special number1 at positions5,11,17,23. So after the third occurrence (position17), the 0s would be replaced with4. But in the output, the 0s after position17 are replaced with3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, after the second occurrence of the special number, replace with4.\n\nIn Example0's row0, after the second8 (position9), the next group (positions10-13) is3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: the replacement number changes based on the number of special numbers in the row. For example, if the row has an even number of special numbers, last group is4; if odd, last group is3.\n\nIn Example0's row0: four 8s (even), so last group is3. But the group before last (third to fourth) is4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the row has an odd number of special numbers, the last group is4; even, it's3. But in Example0's row0, four special numbers (even), last group is3. In Example1's row0, the special numbers (1s) are at positions5,11,17,23 (four occurrences), so even, last group is3.\n\nIn Example0's row0, the third group (between second and third8) is3, then fourth group (between third and fourth) is4. This doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach is not working.\n\nLet's try to think of a different pattern. Perhaps the 0s are replaced with3 if they are in a position where the same column in the previous row has a special number. Otherwise, replaced with4. Or vice versa.\n\nIn Example0's row0, all columns except4,9,14,19 are0. Row1 is the same as row0. In the output, row0's 0s are replaced with3, except columns15-18 (4) and others. Row1's output is the same as row0. So this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is3 if the cell is above a special number in the same column, and4 otherwise. But in Example0's row0, the cell below (row1) has the same structure. Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the pattern is that the 0s are replaced with3 in the top half of the grid and4 in the bottom half. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0, there are 24 rows. Top half (rows0-11) use3, bottom (12-23) use4. But looking at the output, rows5-14 use4, which is in the bottom half. So this might fit. But row15-18 use3 again, which would be in the bottom half. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number depends on the row index modulo a certain number. For example, even rows:3, odd rows:4. But in Example0's row0 (even index0):3, row1 (even index1):3. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is3 for the first third of the rows,4 for the middle third, and3 for the last third. Example0 has 24 rows. First 8 rows:3, next 8:4, last 8:3. But in the output, rows0-3 are3, rows5-14 (10 rows) are4, then rows15-18 (4) and 20-23 (4) are3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: in the test input, the special number is5. So the output will replace 0s with3 or4, keeping5s unchanged. The first divider row in the test input is row3. So applying the pattern from examples, rows before row3 would use3, rows after use4. But divider rows themselves may have their 0s replaced with4.\n\nFor example, test input row3 has two 0s (positions6 and26). These would become4. Rows after row3 (indices4-25) would replace 0s with4. Then, if another divider is encountered (like row7), rows after that would toggle back to3.\n\nAssuming that each divider row toggles the replacement number between3 and4.\n\nSo:\n\n- Before any dividers:3.\n\n- After first divider (row3):4.\n\n- After second divider (row7):3.\n\n- After third divider (row19):4.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow0-2:3.\n\nRow3:0s replaced with4.\n\nRows4-6:4.\n\nRow7:0s replaced with3 (since it's a divider, the toggle happens after it).\n\nRows8-18:3.\n\nRow19:0s replaced with4.\n\nRows20-25:4.\n\nBut need to verify how this would look in the output.\n\nFor example, test input row0:\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nReplaced with3s, since it's before first divider.\n\nSo output row0 would be [3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3].\n\nRow3's input has 0s at positions6 and26. Output would be [5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4].\n\nRow4's input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. After first divider (row3), replacement is4. So output row4: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4].\n\nRow7's input is a divider row, so after that, replacement toggles to3. So rows8-18 use3.\n\nRow8's input: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Output would be [3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3].\n\nRow19's input is a divider row, so after that, replacement toggles to4. Rows20-25:4.\n\nRow20's input: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Output: [4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4].\n\nRow23's input: [5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]. This is a divider row, so after it, replacement toggles to3. But since it's the last row, no rows after.\n\nThis seems plausible. But does this pattern fit the training examples?\n\nLooking at Example0:\n\nDividers at rows4,14,19.\n\n- Before row4:3.\n\n- Between4-14:4.\n\n- Between14-19:3.\n\n- After19:4.\n\nBut in the output, rows20-23 are3. So this would contradict. So this approach may not fit.\n\nBut in the test input's case, maybe this is the pattern we need to apply, even if it doesn't perfectly fit all training examples. Since the examples may have varying patterns, perhaps the rule is to toggle the replacement number each time a divider row is encountered.\n\nThus, for the test input, the output would alternate between3 and4 for each section between dividers.\n\nGiven that, here's the plan:\n\n- Identify divider rows in the test input. A divider row is a row that has a significant number of the special number (5 in this case), possibly with some 0s.\n\n- Each time a divider row is encountered, toggle the replacement number between3 and4.\n\n- The first section (before any dividers) uses3.\n\n- The second section (after first divider) uses4.\n\n- Third section (after second divider) uses3.\n\n- Fourth section (after third divider) uses4.\n\n- etc.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nDivider rows are:\n\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow7: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow19: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow23: [5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nSo four divider rows.\n\nThus:\n\n- Rows0-2:3.\n\n- Rows4-6:4 (after row3).\n\n- Rows8-18:3 (after row7).\n\n- Rows20-25:4 (after row19).\n\n- Rows after row23 would toggle to3, but there are no rows after.\n\nSo applying this:\n\nRow0: 3.\n\nRow1:3.\n\nRow2:3.\n\nRow3: replace 0s with4.\n\nRow4:4.\n\nRow5:4.\n\nRow6:4.\n\nRow7: replace 0s with3.\n\nRow8:3.\n\n... up to row18:3.\n\nRow19: replace 0s with4.\n\nRow20:4.\n\nRow21:4.\n\nRow22:4.\n\nRow23: replace 0s with3.\n\nRow24:3.\n\nRow25:3.\n\nBut how about the actual 0s in the rows:\n\nFor example, row3's input has 0s at positions6 and26. So output row3 would be [5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4].\n\nRow7's input has a 0 at position13 and26. So output row7 would be [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5].\n\nRow19's input has a 0 at position22. So output row19 would be [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5].\n\nRow23's input has 0s at positions5 and18. So output row23 would be [5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5].\n\nThe rest of the rows' 0s are replaced according to the current section's replacement number.\n\nThus, the final answer would replace 0s in the test input rows as follows:\n\n- Rows0-2:3.\n\n- Row3:0s replaced with4.\n\n- Rows4-6:4.\n\n- Row7:0s replaced with3.\n\n- Rows8-18:3.\n\n- Row19:0 replaced with4.\n\n- Rows20-22:4.\n\n- Row23:0s replaced with3.\n\n- Rows24-25:3.\n\nSo applying this to each row:\n\nFor example, row0:\n\n[3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3]\n\nRow4 (replacement4):\n\n[4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4]\n\nRow8 (replacement3):\n\n[3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3]\n\nRow20 (replacement4):\n\n[4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,0 (now 4),4,4,4,0 (4),4,4,4,5,4,4,4].\n\nWait, but row20's input is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. So all 0s would be replaced with4.\n\nThus, row20's output:\n\n[4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4].\n\nBut according to the rule, after row19, the replacement is4. So yes.\n\nThis seems to fit. Let's write the output for the test input accordingly.",
