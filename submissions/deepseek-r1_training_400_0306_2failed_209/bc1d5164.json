        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the input is a 5x7 grid (5 rows, 7 columns), and the output is a 3x3 grid. The task is to transform the input into the output following some pattern from the training examples. Let's look at the examples one by one to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is:\n\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8]\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nThe output is a 3x3 grid:\n\n[0, 8, 0]\n[8, 8, 8]\n[0, 8, 0]\n\nHmm. How did they get that? Let's see. The input has 5 rows. Maybe each row of the output is derived from specific positions in the input rows. For example, maybe the middle element of the output comes from the center of the input? Or perhaps it's combining elements from different rows and columns.\n\nLooking at the first row of the output [0,8,0]. The first row of the input is [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. The output's first row has three elements. Maybe taking the first, middle, and last elements of the input row. For the first input row, the first is 0, middle (4th element) is 0, and last is 0. But the output's first element is 0,8,0. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the output's rows are formed from the first, middle, and last rows of the input. But the input has 5 rows, so maybe rows 0, 2, and 4? Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, output row 0 is [0,8,0], which matches input row 0's elements 0, 8 (position 1?), but not exactly. Alternatively, maybe taking the first, third, and fifth elements from each row. Let's see. Input row 0 has elements 0 (index 0), 8 (1), 0 (2), 0 (3), 0 (4), 8 (5), 0 (6). If we take positions 0, 3, 6, that would be 0, 0, 0. But the output's first row is 0,8,0. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, looking at the output's first row [0,8,0]. The input's first row has 8 at positions 1 and 5. The output's middle element is 8. Maybe the output is taking the non-zero elements from certain positions. Alternatively, maybe it's combining the first and last rows and columns in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the central part of a diamond shape. Looking at Example 0's input, the 8s form a diamond pattern. The output is a smaller diamond. But how?\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output grid is constructed by taking the middle element of each row in the input, but how? Let's see. The input has 7 columns. The middle column is the 4th (index 3). The output has 3 columns. Maybe combining columns around the middle. For example, columns 2, 3, 4 from the input. Let's check.\n\nInput row 0: columns 2,3,4 are 0,0,0. But output row 0 is [0,8,0]. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first, middle, and last elements of the first, middle, and last rows of the input. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the input's first row is [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. The middle row is row 2 (all zeros). The last row is row 4 [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. Taking first element (0), middle (0), last (0) from row 0: but output's first row is [0,8,0]. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe the elements from the first, third, and fifth rows, and columns 0,3,6?\n\nWait, in Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: columns 0,3,6 \u2192 0,0,0 \u2192 but output row 0 is [0,8,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, looking for symmetry. The input in Example 0 is symmetric around the middle column. The output is also symmetric. Maybe the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows, and the middle elements from the middle rows.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at all the examples. Let's take Example 1:\n\nInput:\n\n[2,2,0,0,0,2,2]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0,0,2,0]\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,2]\n[2,0,2]\n\nLooking at the output. The first row is 2,2,2. Let's see the input's rows. The first row has 2s at positions 0,1,5,6. The output's first row is 2,2,2. How to get that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is built by taking elements from the corners and center of the input. Let's see for Example 0:\n\nInput rows 0, 1, 4. For the output's first row, maybe taking elements from input row 0, columns 1, 3, 5. Wait, input row 0 has 8 at column 1 and 5. So 0 (col0), 8 (col1), 0 (col2?), no. Hmm. If we take columns 1, 3,5 from row 0: 8,0,8 \u2192 but output is 0,8,0. That doesn't fit. Wait, output's first row is 0,8,0. Maybe taking elements from row 0's columns 0, 3,6? Which would be 0,0,0. No. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row of the output corresponds to a diagonal in the input. For instance, output row 0 is the top-left to middle, output row 1 is middle elements, etc. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the output dimensions. Input is 5x7, output is 3x3. So maybe the output is a compression of the input. For example, each cell in the output is a combination of certain cells in the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first three rows of the input, and within those, taking certain columns. But the input has 5 rows, so maybe not.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the middle row is [8,8,8]. Let's check the input's middle row (row 2) which is all zeros. So that's not contributing. Maybe the middle row of the output is made from the middle row of the input. No, because in example 0, input's row 2 is all zeros, but output's middle row is 8,8,8. So that's not directly taken.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see the positions of the non-zero elements in the input and how they map to the output. For Example 0, the input has 8s forming a diamond. The output is a smaller diamond. Maybe the output is the center of the input's pattern. But how to map 5x7 to 3x3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the central 3 rows and central 3 columns. But the input is 5x7. The central 3 rows would be rows 1,2,3. The central 3 columns are columns 2,3,4. Let's check for example 0:\n\nRows 1,2,3: \n\nRow1: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]\n\nColumns 2,3,4: So taking elements at columns 2,3,4 (0-based, so indexes 2,3,4).\n\nFor row1: elements at 2,3,4 are 0,0,0 \u2192 output row1 would be [0,0,0], but example0's output row1 is [8,8,8]. That doesn't match.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the edges of the input. For example, in Example0, the first and last rows have 8s at positions 1 and 5. The output's first row has 8 in the middle. Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, each row is 0,8,0; 8,8,8; 0,8,0. So the output is a cross shape. Maybe the input's non-zero elements are being summed or projected into the output's 3x3 grid. Like, each cell in the output represents a sum or presence of certain cells in the input.\n\nAlternatively, think about the input as a 5x7 grid and the output as a 3x3. Maybe each cell in the output corresponds to a specific cell in the input. For example, the output's (0,0) is input's (0,1), (0,1) is input's (0,3), (0,2) is input's (0,5). Similarly, output's (1,0) is input's (1,0), (1,1) is input's (2,3), etc. But this seems arbitrary unless there's a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example1's input and output. Input row 0 is [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]. Output row0 is [2,2,2]. How does that happen? If output row0 is taking elements from input row0: first, middle, last. Input row0's first is 2, middle (index3) is 0, last is 2. So [2,0,2], but output row0 is [2,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's rows are combinations of input rows. For example, output row0 could be a combination of input rows 0 and 4. Let's check. In Example0, output row0 is [0,8,0]. Input row0 and row4 are the same. So maybe combining their elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell is the maximum value from certain input cells. For Example0's output [0,8,0] in row0. Maybe the input's row0 and row4 have 8s in positions 1 and 5. So output row0's middle element is 8. Maybe the output's positions are taking elements from the input's columns 1,3,5. So in input row0, column1 is 8, column3 is 0, column5 is 8. But output row0 is [0,8,0]. Hmm, maybe it's taking the middle column (3) from the input row, but that's 0. Not matching.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the middle element of the output's middle row is 8. The input's middle row (row2) is all zeros. So that can't be it.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the output as a 3x3 grid where each cell is derived from a specific position in the input's 5x7 grid. For example:\n\nOutput cell (0,0) could be input cell (0,1)\nOutput cell (0,1) could be input cell (0,3)\nOutput cell (0,2) could be input cell (0,5)\nOutput cell (1,0) could be input cell (1,0)\nOutput cell (1,1) could be input cell (2,3)\nOutput cell (1,2) could be input cell (1,6)\nOutput cell (2,0) could be input cell (4,1)\nOutput cell (2,1) could be input cell (4,3)\nOutput cell (2,2) could be input cell (4,5)\n\nLet's test this for Example0:\n\nOutput (0,0) = input (0,1) = 8 \u2192 but output's [0,8,0], so (0,0) is 0. Hmm, doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe output cells are taken from input cells in a diamond-shaped pattern. For instance, the center of the input (row2, column3) is the center of the output (1,1). Then, moving outwards. But how?\n\nAnother thought: The input has 5 rows and 7 columns. The output is 3 rows and 3 columns. Maybe the output is constructed by taking the first, third, and fifth columns of the first, third, and fifth rows. But input has 5 rows (indices 0-4), so third row is index 2. Similarly, columns 0, 3, 6 (since 7 columns). Let's check Example0:\n\nRows 0,2,4. Columns 0,3,6.\n\nRow0: [0 (col0), 0 (col3), 0 (col6)] \u2192 [0,0,0]. But output row0 is [0,8,0]. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, rows 0,1,4 and columns 1,3,5.\n\nRow0: columns 1,3,5 \u2192 8,0,8 \u2192 output row0 is 0,8,0. Maybe if taking max of left and right? 8 and 8 would be 8, but output is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's look at another example. Example1's output is:\n\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,2]\n[2,0,2]\n\nLooking at the input for Example1:\n\nInput row0: [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\nRow4: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nOutput row0: [2,2,2]. If we take the non-zero elements from input row0, but row0 has 2s at positions 0,1,5,6. How does that become 2,2,2. Maybe sum or presence? Or maybe taking the first, middle, and last elements of certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is a combination of elements from different input rows. For example, output row0 could be the first elements of input row0, row1, row4. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output's first row is formed by the first element of input row0, the middle element of input row0, and the last element of input row0. But in Example0, that would be 0,0,0, which doesn't match the output row0 of [0,8,0]. So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a pattern in the positions of the numbers. For example, in Example0's output:\n\nThe first row has 0,8,0. The input's row0 has 8s at positions 1 and 5. The output's row0 has 8 at position1. Maybe taking the middle of the first row's non-zero elements? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compare the input and output for all examples to see if there's a common transformation.\n\nLooking at Example3:\n\nInput:\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[4,0,0,0,0,4,4]\n\nOutput:\n\n[4,0,4]\n[0,0,0]\n[4,4,4]\n\nHmm. The output's first row is 4,0,4. The input's first row has 4s at positions 0 and 6. The output's first row is 4 at positions 0 and 2. So maybe taking the first and last elements of the first row and putting them in the first and last positions of the output's first row. Then, the middle of output's first row is 0. That matches. Similarly, the output's third row is [4,4,4]. The input's last row has 4s at positions 0,5,6. The output's third row has 4s in all three positions. So perhaps, for the output's third row, taking the first, fifth, and sixth elements of the input's last row. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the output's rows are constructed from the first, third, and fifth rows of the input, but Example3's input has rows 0,1,2,3,4. So output rows would be 0,2,4. But output row0 is [4,0,4], which corresponds to input row0's 4 at positions0 and6. If output row0 takes input row0's first and last elements and middle (which is 0), then that gives 4,0,4. For output row2, which is [4,4,4], input row4 has 4s at positions0,5,6. So output row2 is 4 (pos0),4 (pos5?),4 (pos6?). But output has three positions. Maybe in the output row2, the elements are taken from input row4's first, fifth, and sixth elements. Which are 4,0,4. But the output row is [4,4,4]. Wait, input row4's fifth element is 0 (index5: 4,0,0,0,0,4,4). Wait, no: the input row4 is [4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. So positions0:4, position5:4, position6:4. So output row2 would be 4 (pos0), 4 (pos5),4 (pos6). But how to fit into 3 elements. So output row2's elements are [4,4,4], which matches taking the first, fifth, sixth elements. But why those positions?\n\nSimilarly, in Example0's output row2 is [0,8,0], and input row4 is [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. Taking first, fifth, sixth elements? Wait, input row4's first is0, fifth is8, sixth is0. So output row2 would be 0,8,0. Which matches. So maybe for the output's row0, it's input row0's first, fifth, sixth elements. For row2, input row4's first, fifth, sixth elements.\n\nWait, let's check Example0's output row0: [0,8,0]. Input row0's first element is0, fifth is8, sixth is0. So yes, that's the pattern. Then output row0 is [input row0's first, fifth, sixth].\n\nFor output row2: [0,8,0] \u2192 input row4's first (0), fifth (8), sixth (0). So same pattern.\n\nWhat about the middle row of the output? For Example0, output row1 is [8,8,8]. Let's see which input rows and elements. The middle row of the output is row1. Maybe it's input row1's first, fifth, sixth elements. Input row1 is [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]. So first is8, fifth is8, sixth is8. So [8,8,8], which matches the output. \n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\nEach row in the output is constructed from the input rows as follows:\n\n- Output row0: first, fifth, sixth elements of input row0.\n\n- Output row1: first, fifth, sixth elements of input row1.\n\n- Output row2: first, fifth, sixth elements of input row4.\n\nWait, but in Example1's input:\n\nInput row0 is [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]. So first is2, fifth is2, sixth is2. So output row0 should be [2,2,2], which matches Example1's output row0.\n\nInput row1 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. first is0, fifth is0, sixth is2. So output row1 would be [0,0,2], but the actual output row1 is [0,2,2]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So this theory is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe it's first, sixth, fifth? Let's see:\n\nFor Example1's input row1: first is0, sixth is2, fifth is0. So [0,2,0], but output row1 is [0,2,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. So maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternative idea: Looking at Example1's output row1 is [0,2,2]. The input row1 has elements [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. Maybe taking elements from input row1's columns 5,6, something else. Like fifth (0), sixth (2), and another position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's middle row is formed by input row1 and row3. For Example0, input row1's first, fifth, sixth are 8,8,8. For output row1: [8,8,8]. Which fits. For Example1, input row1's first is0, fifth is0, sixth is2. But output row1 is [0,2,2]. So perhaps fifth is 0, sixth is2, and another element. Maybe combining with input row3.\n\nExample1's input row3 is [0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. So first is0, fifth is2, sixth is0. So output row1 could be [0 (from row1's first), 2 (from row3's fifth), 2 (from row1's sixth)]. So [0,2,2]. That matches Example1's output row1. So maybe the middle row of the output is a combination of row1 and row3.\n\nSo the pattern might be:\n\n- Output row0: input row0's first, row0's fifth, row0's sixth elements.\n\n- Output row1: input row1's first, row3's fifth, row1's sixth elements.\n\n- Output row2: input row4's first, row4's fifth, row4's sixth elements.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: first 0, fifth 8, sixth 0 \u2192 [0,8,0] \u2192 matches.\n\nRow1: row1's first 8, row3's fifth 8 (input row3 is [8,8,0,0,0,8,8], fifth element is8), row1's sixth 8 \u2192 [8,8,8] \u2192 correct.\n\nRow2: row4's first0, fifth8, sixth0 \u2192 [0,8,0] \u2192 correct.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0: input row0 first2, fifth2, sixth2 \u2192 [2,2,2] \u2192 correct.\n\nRow1: input row1 first0, input row3's fifth2 (row3 is [0,2,0,0,0,2,0], fifth element is2), input row1's sixth2 \u2192 [0,2,2] \u2192 correct.\n\nRow2: input row4's first2, fifth0 (row4 is [2,0,0,0,0,0,2], fifth element0), sixth2 \u2192 [2,0,2] \u2192 correct.\n\nYes! This seems to fit Example1.\n\nLet's check Example2:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,0,0,4,0] \u2192 first4, fifth4, sixth0 \u2192 output row0 should be [4,4,0] \u2192 which matches the output.\n\nRow1: input row1's first0, input row3's fifth (row3 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], fifth0), row1's sixth4 \u2192 [0,0,4] \u2192 but actual output row1 is [0,4,4]. Wait, no. So this theory may not hold.\n\nWait, Example2's output row1 is [0,4,4]. Let's see what input rows are involved. According to the theory, row1's first is0, row3's fifth is0 (since row3 is all zeros), row1's sixth is4. So combining gives [0,0,4], but the output is [0,4,4]. So discrepancy here.\n\nHmm, maybe the fifth element is taken from row3's fifth. Wait, in Example2's input row3 is all zeros. So row3's fifth is0. So output row1 should be [0,0,4], but the actual output is [0,4,4]. So this breaks the pattern. So this theory must be incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at Example2's input and output.\n\nInput for Example2:\n\n[4,4,0,0,0,4,0] (row0)\n[0,0,0,0,0,4,4] (row1)\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (row2)\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (row3)\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,4] (row4)\n\nOutput:\n\n[4,4,0]\n[0,4,4]\n[4,0,4]\n\nOutput row1 is [0,4,4]. Let's see how that can be derived. Input row1 has fifth element4 (index5), sixth element4 (index6). But according to previous theory, row1's first is0, row3's fifth is0, row1's sixth is4. So 0,0,4. But output is 0,4,4. So perhaps the middle element is row1's fifth instead of row3's fifth. Let's check:\n\nrow1's first is0, row1's fifth is4, row1's sixth is4 \u2192 [0,4,4]. Which matches. But how does that fit with other examples.\n\nFor Example0, output row1 would be input row1's first (8), fifth (8), sixth (8) \u2192 [8,8,8], which is correct.\n\nFor Example1's row1: input row1's first0, fifth0, sixth2 \u2192 [0,0,2], but actual output row1 is [0,2,2]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nSo this approach works for Example0 and Example2, but not Example1.\n\nAlternative theory: Maybe the output rows are constructed from specific rows and columns of the input. For example:\n\nOutput row0: input row0, columns 0,5,6.\n\nOutput row1: input row1, columns0,5,6.\n\nOutput row2: input row4, columns0,5,6.\n\nLet's check Example0:\n\nrow0 columns0,5,6 \u2192 0,8,0 \u2192 matches output row0.\n\nrow1 columns0,5,6 \u2192 8,8,8 \u2192 matches row1.\n\nrow4 columns0,5,6 \u2192 0,8,0 \u2192 matches row2.\n\nExample1:\n\nrow0 columns0,5,6 \u2192 2,2,2 \u2192 matches.\n\nrow1 columns0,5,6 \u2192 0,0,2 \u2192 but output row1 is [0,2,2]. So discrepancy here.\n\nHmm. Example1's output row1 is [0,2,2], but according to this, it's [0,0,2]. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nBut wait, in Example1's input row1, fifth element is0 (index5), sixth is2 (index6). So columns5 and6 are0 and2. So why does output row1 have 2 in the middle?\n\nLooking back at Example1's output row1: [0,2,2]. So middle element is2. Where does that come from? Maybe the fifth element is taken from a different row.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps output row0 is input row0 columns0,5,6.\n\nOutput row1 is input row3 columns0,5,6.\n\nOutput row2 is input row4 columns0,5,6.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample0:\n\nrow3 columns0,5,6 \u2192 8,8,8 \u2192 matches output row1.\n\nExample1:\n\nrow3 is [0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. columns0,5,6 \u2192 0,2,0. So output row1 would be [0,2,0], but actual output row1 is [0,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe combining row1 and row3 for output row1.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for a pattern in the output's columns. For each column in the output, perhaps they are derived from specific columns in the input.\n\nFor example, output column0 could be input column0 from rows 0,1,4.\n\nExample0's output column0 is [0,8,0]. Input column0 is:\n\nrow0:0\n\nrow1:8\n\nrow4:0 \u2192 So [0,8,0]. Correct.\n\nOutput column1 is [8,8,8]. Input column1 for rows0,1,4:8,8,8. Correct.\n\nOutput column2 is [0,8,0]. Input column5 for rows0,1,4:8 (row0),8 (row1),8 (row4). Wait, input column5 for row0 is8, row1 is8, row4 is8. But output column2 is [0,8,0]. So that doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Maybe output columns are input columns0,1,5.\n\nExample0's output would be:\n\nrow0:0 (col0),8 (col1),0 (col5?) No, input row0's col5 is8. Output row0's last element is0. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is a combination of the first and last rows and the middle row's elements. For example, output row0 is first row's first, middle, last elements. Output row2 is last row's first, middle, last. Output row1 is middle row's first, middle, last. But in Example0's input middle row is all zeros, so output row1 would be [0,0,0], but the actual output row1 is [8,8,8]. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's columns are derived from the input's columns. For example, output column0 is input column0 from rows0,1,4. Output column1 is input column3 from rows0,1,4. Output column2 is input column6 from rows0,1,4.\n\nTesting this for Example0:\n\nOutput column0: rows0,1,4's column0 \u2192 0,8,0 \u2192 matches.\n\nOutput column1: rows0,1,4's column3 \u2192 0,0,0 \u2192 but output column1 is8,8,8. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Not working.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output is a 3x3 grid. The input has 5 rows. So perhaps each row of the output is formed by the first, third, and fifth rows of the input. But there are only 5 rows, so first, third, fifth would be rows0,2,4. But Example0's output rows are formed from rows0,1,4. So maybe not.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output rows:\n\n[0,8,0] \u2192 input row0\n\n[8,8,8] \u2192 input row1\n\n[0,8,0] \u2192 input row4\n\nSo output rows are input rows0,1,4. So the output is a selection of rows0,1,4. But how are the columns selected?\n\nThe input has 7 columns. Output has3 columns. So perhaps columns0,3,6. For Example0:\n\nRow0, columns0,3,6 \u2192 0,0,0. But output row0 is [0,8,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, columns1,3,5. For Example0's row0: columns1 is8,3 is0,5 is8 \u2192 [8,0,8]. Output row0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is the sum of certain columns. For example, output's middle column is the sum of the middle three columns of the input. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output's middle element, which is often the same as the input's middle element. For Example0, the input's middle row is all zeros, but output's middle element is8. So that's not.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think differently. Maybe the output is created by taking elements from specific positions in the input grid. For each output cell (i,j), there's a corresponding input cell (x,y) that determines its value.\n\nLooking at Example0:\n\nOutput[0][0] =0 \u2192 Input[0][0] =0.\n\nOutput[0][1] =8 \u2192 Input[0][1] =8.\n\nOutput[0][2] =0 \u2192 Input[0][6] =0.\n\nOutput[1][0] =8 \u2192 Input[1][0] =8.\n\nOutput[1][1] =8 \u2192 Input[1][3] =0? No. Or Input[2][3] =0. No.\n\nHmm, this isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a mirror or rotation of certain parts. For example, the output could be the upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right corners of the input. But not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is formed by taking the first three elements of the first row, the middle three elements of the middle row, and the last three elements of the last row. But Example0's first row is [0,8,0,0,0,8,0], first three are [0,8,0] which matches the output row0. Middle row (row2) is all zeros \u2192 middle three elements [0,0,0], but output row1 is [8,8,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but Example0's output row1 is [8,8,8], which matches input row1's elements [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]. If we take the first, fifth, and sixth elements of row1: 8,8,8. Which matches. So output row1 is first, fifth, sixth of row1. Output row0 is first, fifth, sixth of row0. Output row2 is first, fifth, sixth of row4.\n\nLet's test this for all examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: first0, fifth8, sixth0 \u2192 [0,8,0].\n\nRow1: first8, fifth8, sixth8 \u2192 [8,8,8].\n\nRow4: first0, fifth8, sixth0 \u2192 [0,8,0].\n\nCorrect.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0: first2, fifth2, sixth2 \u2192 [2,2,2].\n\nRow1: first0, fifth0, sixth2 \u2192 [0,0,2]. But output row1 is [0,2,2]. So discrepancy.\n\nHmm. So this doesn't fit. But in Example1's output row1, the middle element is2. Where does that come from?\n\nLooking at Example1's input:\n\nRow3 is [0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. fifth element is2, sixth is0. So if output row1 is row3's first, fifth, sixth: [0,2,0]. But output row1 is [0,2,2].\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe output row1 is formed by taking the first element from row1, fifth element from row3, and sixth element from row1. Let's see:\n\nExample1's row1 first is0, row3 fifth is2, row1 sixth is2 \u2192 [0,2,2]. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern would be:\n\nOutput row0: row0's first, row0's fifth, row0's sixth.\n\nOutput row1: row1's first, row3's fifth, row1's sixth.\n\nOutput row2: row4's first, row4's fifth, row4's sixth.\n\nLet's check this for all examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0:0,8,0 \u2192 correct.\n\nRow1:8 (row1's first), row3's fifth (8), row1's sixth (8) \u2192 [8,8,8].\n\nRow4:0,8,0 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0:2,2,2 \u2192 correct.\n\nRow1:0 (row1's first), row3's fifth (2), row1's sixth (2) \u2192 [0,2,2] \u2192 correct.\n\nRow4's first2, fifth0, sixth2 \u2192 [2,0,2] \u2192 correct.\n\nExample2:\n\nOutput is [4,4,0], [0,4,4], [4,0,4].\n\nRow0: first4, fifth4 (row0's fifth is4), sixth0 \u2192 [4,4,0].\n\nRow1: row1's first0, row3's fifth (row3 is all zeros \u2192 fifth0), row1's sixth4 \u2192 [0,0,4]. But output row1 is [0,4,4]. So discrepancy.\n\nHmm. Example2's output row1 is [0,4,4]. But according to this pattern, it's [0,0,4]. So this theory fails here.\n\nExample2's input row3 is all zeros. So row3's fifth is0. But output row1's middle element is4. So where does that 4 come from?\n\nLooking back at Example2's input row1: [0,0,0,0,0,4,4]. fifth element is4, sixth is4.\n\nIf output row1 is row1's first, fifth, sixth: 0,4,4 \u2192 [0,4,4], which matches. But why would row3's fifth not be involved here?\n\nSo maybe the pattern for row1 is different depending on the example, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern for row1 is the first, fifth, and sixth elements of row1. Let's see:\n\nExample0's row1:8,8,8 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample1's row1:0,0,2 \u2192 but output row1 is [0,2,2]. So discrepancy.\n\nExample2's row1:0,4,4 \u2192 which matches output row1.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput row0:4,0,0,0,0,0,4 \u2192 first4, fifth0, sixth4 \u2192 output row0 is [4,0,4], which matches.\n\nRow1 is all zeros \u2192 first0, fifth0, sixth0 \u2192 output row1 would be [0,0,0], which matches.\n\nRow4:4,0,0,0,0,4,4 \u2192 first4, fifth4, sixth4 \u2192 [4,4,4], which matches.\n\nSo for Example3, this theory works.\n\nExample4's input:\n\nRow0:0,3,0,0,0,3,0 \u2192 first0, fifth3, sixth0 \u2192 output row0 [0,3,0], which matches.\n\nRow1:3,0,0,0,0,0,3 \u2192 first3, fifth0, sixth3 \u2192 output row1 should be [3,0,3], which matches.\n\nRow4:0,0,0,0,0,0,3 \u2192 first0, fifth0, sixth3 \u2192 output row2 [0,0,3], which matches.\n\nSo this theory works for Examples0, 2, 3,4, but not for Example1.\n\nSo why does Example1's output row1 have [0,2,2] when the fifth element of row1 is0?\n\nLooking at Example1's input:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nSo fifth element (index5) is0. Sixth element is2.\n\nSo according to the theory, row1's output would be [0,0,2]. But the actual output is [0,2,2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example1's output row1, the middle element is2. Where does that come from?\n\nLooking at row3's fifth element: row3 is [0,2,0,0,0,2,0], so fifth element (index5) is2. So maybe the middle element of output row1 is taken from row3's fifth element.\n\nSo the pattern would be:\n\nOutput row0: row0's first, row0's fifth, row0's sixth.\n\nOutput row1: row1's first, row3's fifth, row1's sixth.\n\nOutput row2: row4's first, row4's fifth, row4's sixth.\n\nLet's test this for Example1:\n\nRow0: row0's first2, fifth2, sixth2 \u2192 [2,2,2] \u2192 correct.\n\nRow1: row1's first0, row3's fifth2, row1's sixth2 \u2192 [0,2,2] \u2192 correct.\n\nRow2: row4's first2, row4's fifth0, row4's sixth2 \u2192 [2,0,2] \u2192 correct.\n\nFor Example2:\n\nRow1: row1's first0, row3's fifth0 (since row3 is all zeros), row1's sixth4 \u2192 [0,0,4]. But output row1 is [0,4,4]. So discrepancy.\n\nBut Example2's input row3 is all zeros. So row3's fifth is0. So output row1 would be [0,0,4], but the actual output row1 is [0,4,4]. So this theory doesn't work for Example2.\n\nHmm. What's different between Example1 and Example2?\n\nIn Example1, row3's fifth is2. In Example2, row3's fifth is0. So why in Example2's output row1, the middle element is4?\n\nLooking at Example2's input row1's fifth is4 (index5) in row1. So maybe the pattern is that for output row1's middle element, we take row1's fifth if row3's fifth is zero. Or some conditional logic. But this complicates the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output row1's middle element is the maximum of row1's fifth and row3's fifth. In Example1: max(0,2) is2. In Example2: max(4,0) is4. Example0: max(8,8) is8. Example3: max(0,0) is0. Example4: max(0,0) is0. So this could explain it.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0:\n\nRow1's fifth is8, row3's fifth is8 \u2192 max is8 \u2192 middle element8.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow1's fifth0, row3's fifth2 \u2192 max2 \u2192 middle element2.\n\nExample2:\n\nRow1's fifth4, row3's fifth0 \u2192 max4 \u2192 middle element4.\n\nExample3:\n\nRow1's fifth0, row3's fifth0 \u2192 max0 \u2192 middle0.\n\nExample4:\n\nRow1's fifth0, row3's fifth0 \u2192 max0 \u2192 middle0.\n\nSo this would explain the middle element of output row1. But how about the other elements?\n\nThen the pattern would be:\n\nOutput row0: row0's first, row0's fifth, row0's sixth.\n\nOutput row1: row1's first, max(row1's fifth, row3's fifth), row1's sixth.\n\nOutput row2: row4's first, row4's fifth, row4's sixth.\n\nThis seems to fit all examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0:0,8,0 \u2192 correct.\n\nRow1:8, max(8,8)=8,8 \u2192 [8,8,8].\n\nRow4:0,8,0 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0:2,2,2 \u2192 correct.\n\nRow1:0, max(0,2)=2,2 \u2192 [0,2,2].\n\nRow4:2,0,2 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample2:\n\nRow0:4,4,0 \u2192 correct.\n\nRow1:0, max(4,0)=4,4 \u2192 [0,4,4].\n\nRow4:4,0,4 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample3:\n\nRow0:4,0,4 \u2192 correct.\n\nRow1:0, max(0,0)=0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0].\n\nRow4:4,4,4 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample4:\n\nRow0:0,3,0 \u2192 correct.\n\nRow1:3, max(0,0)=0,3 \u2192 [3,0,3].\n\nRow4:0,0,3 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes! This pattern works for all training examples. So the rule is:\n\n- For each of the three output rows:\n\n  - Output row0 is [input row0[0], input row0[5], input row0[6]].\n\n  - Output row1 is [input row1[0], max(input row1[5], input row3[5]), input row1[6]].\n\n  - Output row2 is [input row4[0], input row4[5], input row4[6]].\n\nNow, applying this pattern to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  // row0\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // row1\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // row2\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // row3\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  // row4\n\nProcessing each output row:\n\nOutput row0: row0[0] =0, row0[5]=1, row0[6]=1 \u2192 [0,1,1].\n\nOutput row1: row1[0]=1, max(row1[5]=0, row3[5]=0) \u2192 0, row1[6]=0 \u2192 [1,0,0].\n\nOutput row2: row4[0]=0, row4[5]=0, row4[6]=1 \u2192 [0,0,1].\n\nBut let's check the training examples to see if this aligns. However, looking back at the training examples, the output for example3's row2 is [4,4,4], which comes from row4's 0,5,6 indices. In the test input, row4's [0,1,0,0,0,0,1] has indices0:0,5:0,6:1. So output row2 would be [0,0,1]. But let's see if this matches any patterns.\n\nBut wait, according to the pattern we've determined, output row2 is [row4[0], row4[5], row4[6]] \u2192 for the test case: 0,0,1 \u2192 [0,0,1].\n\nBut looking at the test input's output, is this correct? Let's see.\n\nBut according to the pattern, yes. However, let's cross-validate with the training examples to ensure consistency.\n\nFor example, in Example4's output row2 is [0,0,3]. The input's row4 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,3], so row4[0]=0, row4[5]=0, row4[6]=3 \u2192 [0,0,3], which matches. So the pattern holds.\n\nThus, applying this to the test input:\n\nOutput row0: [0,1,1]\n\nOutput row1: [1,0,0]\n\nOutput row2: [0,0,1]\n\nBut wait, the test input's row1 is [1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So row1[0]=1, row1[5]=0, row1[6]=0. The output row1 would be [1, max(row1[5]=0, row3[5]=0) \u2192 0, row1[6]=0 \u2192 [1,0,0].\n\nBut let's check the actual output examples. For instance, in Example4's output row1 is [3,0,3], which is input row1's first3, row3's fifth0, row1's sixth3. So the pattern holds.\n\nThus, the final output should be:\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\nBut let's check the formatting of the training examples. For example, in Example1, the output is written as:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[0,2,2]\n\n[2,0,2]\n\nSo each row is enclosed in square brackets, separated by newlines.\n\nSo following that format, the test output should be:\n\n[0, 1, 1]\n\n[1, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 1]\n\nBut wait, the test input's row4's sixth element is 1. So row4[6] is1. So the third row of the output is [0,0,1].\n\nThus, the final answer should be as above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to take a 5x7 grid (since each input example has 5 rows, each with 7 elements) and transform it into a 3x3 grid output. I need to see how each example's input maps to its output. Let's go through the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is:\n\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8]\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nThe output is a 3x3 grid:\n\n[0, 8, 0]\n[8, 8, 8]\n[0, 8, 0]\n\nLooking at the input, maybe the output is constructed by taking certain elements from the input grid. Let's see the positions. The input has 5 rows and 7 columns. The output is 3x3. Maybe it's taking the middle row and columns? But the input's middle row (third row) is all zeros, which becomes the middle row of the output. Wait, in the output's middle row, it's [8,8,8]. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's combining elements from the first, third, and fifth rows of the input. Let me check:\n\nRow 0 of input: positions 0, 1, 6 (indices 0,1,6?) Wait, the input rows have 7 elements each, so indices 0-6. For the output's first row, maybe they take elements from the first row's positions 1, 3, 5? Because 0,8,0... the output is 0,8,0. Wait, the first input row is [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. So the elements at positions 0, 3, and 6 are 0,0,0. That doesn't match. Wait, output's first row is 0,8,0. So maybe positions 0,3,6? But those are 0,0,0. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first, middle, and last rows of the input, but then combining their elements. Let's see the input rows for Example 0:\n\nRow 0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\nRow 1: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 3: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]\nRow 4: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nOutput rows are three. Maybe the output rows correspond to input rows 0, 2, 4 (first, middle, last)? Let's check:\n\nRow 0 of output: [0,8,0] which matches the first elements of input row 0 (0,8,0 in positions 0,1,6?) Wait input row 0 has elements at 0:0, 1:8, 2:0, 3:0, 4:0,5:8,6:0. So if we take positions 0, 3, and 6, that's 0,0,0. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe the columns are being compressed. The input has 7 columns. The output has 3. So perhaps columns are combined in some way. For example, taking columns 0, 3, 6 from each row. Let's check:\n\nIn example 0's input, for row 0, columns 0,3,6 are 0,0,0. But the output's first row is [0,8,0]. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell is derived from a combination of input cells. For example, the center of the input is row 2, column 3. Maybe the output is focusing on that area. Let's look at Example 0's output. The middle cell is 8. The input's middle row is all zeros. So that can't be it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is constructed by taking the first, third, and fifth elements of each row. For example, in the first input row of Example 0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0], taking elements at positions 0, 3, 6 gives [0,0,0]. But the output's first row is [0,8,0]. That doesn't align. Alternatively, positions 1,3,5. For row 0: 8 (pos1), 0 (pos3),8 (pos5) which gives 8,0,8. But the output is 0,8,0. Hmm, not matching.\n\nLooking at the output structure for Example 0, it's a diamond shape. 8 in the center and around. Maybe it's a convolution or some kind of pattern where overlapping cells are summed or selected. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the top-left, center, and bottom-right parts of the input. Not sure.\n\nLet's look at another example. Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[2,2,0,0,0,2,2]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,0,0,2,0]\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,2]\n[2,0,2]\n\nLooking at this, perhaps the output rows are formed by combining the first, third, and fifth rows of the input, but how? Let's see:\n\nOutput row 0: [2,2,2]. The input's first row (row 0) is [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]. If we take the first three elements, but they are [2,2,0], which isn't matching. Alternatively, maybe taking elements from different positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell is the sum or some combination of cells from the input. For example, output cell (0,0) could be the sum of input cells (0,0), (0,6), (4,0), (4,6). Let's see. For Example 0, output cell (0,0) is 0. Input cells 0,0 is 0, 0,6 is 0, 4,0 is 0, 4,6 is 0. Sum is 0. For Example 1, output (0,0) is 2. Input 0,0 is 2, 0,6 is 2, 4,0 is 2, 4,6 is 2. Sum would be 8, but output is 2. So that's not adding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe taking the maximum value in certain positions. For Example 1, output (0,0) is 2. The input cells in positions 0,0, 0,6, 4,0, 4,6 are 2,2,2,2. Max is 2. That fits. Output (0,1) is 2. Maybe positions around there? Hmm. Let's check another example. Example 0's output (0,1) is 8. Input cells: maybe the first row, middle elements. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: The input is a 5x7 grid. The output is 3x3. Maybe the output is created by collapsing the rows and columns. For example, each output row is formed by combining rows 0 and 4, rows 1 and 3, and row 2 of the input. Then, columns are combined by taking columns 0, 3, 6. Let's try this for Example 0.\n\nRows 0 and 4 in input for Example 0:\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\nRow4: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\nCombined somehow (sum, max, etc.). If we take max of each column between these two rows (they are same), so row0 would be [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. Then columns 0,3,6 would be [0,0,0]. But the output's first row is [0,8,0]. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, combining rows 0 and 1 and 4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the three middle rows (rows 1, 2, 3) of the input, but taking the middle three columns. But in Example 0, the output is 3x3. The input's rows 1,2,3 are:\n\nRow1: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]\n\nIf we take columns 2,3,4 (middle three), but those are 0,0,0 for row1, which would be [0,0,0], but output's middle row is [8,8,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is constructed by taking elements from the corners and the center. For instance, the output's top-left cell could be the input's top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right? Let's check Example 0:\n\nInput's top-left (0,0) is 0, top-right (0,6) is 0, bottom-left (4,0) is 0, bottom-right (4,6) is 0. But output's top-left is 0. Maybe that's part of it. Then the middle cell of the output would be the center of the input (row2, column3) which is 0. But in Example0's output, the middle cell is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell represents a certain pattern in the input. For example, the output's (0,0) is the input's (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), etc. Let's see.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\nRow0: [0,8,0]\nRow1: [8,8,8]\nRow2: [0,8,0]\n\nThis looks like a cross shape. Maybe each cell in the output is the sum or presence of a certain pattern in the input. For example, the center cell of the output (1,1) in Example0 is 8, which might come from the input's middle columns. Wait, input's row1 and row3 have 8s in columns 0,1,5,6. But output's middle row is all 8s. Not sure.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's compare input and output for each example and see if there's a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's input and output:\n\nInput rows 0 and 4 have 8s at positions 1 and 5. The output's first and third rows have 8s in the middle. The middle row of the output has all 8s. Maybe the output's rows are formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input's corresponding rows. For example, input row0 has 8s at positions 1 and 5. The output's first row is [0,8,0]. Hmm, that's the middle element. So perhaps the output takes the middle element of each input row? But input rows are 7 elements long, so the middle is position 3. But input row0's position3 is 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's columns are derived from the input's columns. For example, output column0 is the first, third, fifth elements of input column1. Let's check. Input column1 in Example0:\n\nRow0:8, row1:8, row2:0, row3:8, row4:8. If we take first, third, fifth elements (rows 0,2,4), we get 8,0,8. But output's column0 is [0,8,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of certain rows and columns. For instance, each output row is the sum of two input rows. For Example0, output has 3 rows. Input has 5 rows. Maybe row0 of output is row0 + row4 of input. Let's see. Row0 and row4 in Example0 are the same: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. Adding them would give [0,16,0,0,0,16,0]. But the output's first row is [0,8,0]. So maybe taking the average? 16/2=8. So that could be. Then output row0 would be [0,8,0,0,0,8,0] averaged with itself. But how does this become [0,8,0]? Maybe only taking certain columns. For example, columns 0,3,6 of the summed row. For row0 summed, columns 0,3,6 would be 0,0,0. But output's first row is [0,8,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's look at Example3's input and output.\n\nInput for Example3:\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[4,0,0,0,0,4,4]\n\nOutput:\n[4,0,4]\n[0,0,0]\n[4,4,4]\n\nLooking at the input rows 0 and 4. Row0 has 4s at 0 and 6. Row4 has 4s at 0,5,6. The output's first row is [4,0,4], which could correspond to 4 from row0 (pos0), 0 (maybe middle?), and 4 from row0 (pos6). The output's third row is [4,4,4], which could be from row4's 4s at 0,5,6. Wait, row4 is [4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. So elements 0,5,6 are 4,4,4. So output's third row is [4,4,4]. That matches. So for the third row of the output, maybe it's taking the first, fifth, and sixth elements of the last input row (row4). But why fifth and sixth? Because 5 and 6 indices? But the output has three elements. So perhaps taking positions 0,5,6 for row4, which gives 4,4,4. Then the third row of output is [4,4,4].\n\nSimilarly, output's first row is [4,0,4]. Input row0 is [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]. So positions 0,3,6? 4,0,4. So that's [4,0,4]. That's exactly the first row of the output. Oh! So maybe the output is formed by taking from each of the input rows (or specific rows) the first, middle, and last elements. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. First element 0, middle (index 3) 0, last 0. But output's first row is [0,8,0]. That doesn't match. Hmm. Wait, perhaps for the output, the rows are formed by taking certain rows from the input and then taking certain columns. For example, in Example3, the first output row is the first input row's 0th, 3rd, and 6th elements (4,0,4). The third output row is the fourth input row's 0th, 5th, 6th elements (4,4,4). Wait, but row4 is [4,0,0,0,0,4,4], so 0th is 4, 5th is 4, 6th is4. So that's 4,4,4. So the output's third row is elements 0,5,6 from input row4. Similarly, for the first output row, elements 0,3,6 from input row0.\n\nBut why in Example0's output, the first row is [0,8,0]. Let's check input row0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. If we take 0th, 3rd, 6th elements: 0,0,0. But the output is [0,8,0]. So that's not matching. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's rows are constructed by taking the first, middle, and last elements of certain input rows. Let's see:\n\nFor Example3's output first row: input row0's first (0), middle (3rd), last (6th) elements: 4,0,4. Which matches [4,0,4].\n\nFor Example0's output first row: [0,8,0]. But input row0's first, middle, last are 0,0,0. So that doesn't fit. So this approach works for Example3 but not for Example0. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nLooking back at Example0's output: the first row is [0,8,0]. The input's first row is [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. Maybe taking elements 0, 3, 6 from the input row0: 0,0,0. Not matching. Alternatively, elements 1,3,5: 8,0,8. Which would be [8,0,8]. But output is [0,8,0]. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: The output's rows are formed by taking the first, third, and fifth rows of the input, but then taking specific columns. For example, output row0 comes from input row0, output row1 from input row2, output row2 from input row4. But in Example0, output row1 is [8,8,8]. Input row2 is all zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the middle row is [8,8,8]. The input's rows 1 and 3 are [8,8,0,0,0,8,8]. So maybe output row1 is a combination of rows 1 and 3. If we take columns 0,3,6 from row1: 8,0,8. But output row1 is [8,8,8]. Hmm. 8,0,8 vs 8,8,8. So the middle element (0) is replaced by 8. Where does that come from? Maybe the middle column (3) is from a different row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from the input's rows 0, 2, 4, and columns 1, 3, 5. Let's check for Example0:\n\nRow0, columns1:8, row0, col3:0, row0, col5:8. So output row0 would be [8,0,8]. But Example0's output row0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern that fits all examples. Let's take another example, Example4:\n\nInput:\n[0,3,0,0,0,3,0]\n[3,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput:\n[0,3,0]\n[3,0,3]\n[0,0,3]\n\nThe output's first row is [0,3,0]. The input's first row is [0,3,0,0,0,3,0]. If we take elements 0,3,6: 0,0,0. But output is [0,3,0]. So perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe elements 1,3,5. For row0:3,0,3. Output row0 is [0,3,0]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each output row, we look at the input's rows in a certain way. For example, the output's first row is the first input row's elements 1,3,5. Let's see for Example4's input row0: elements1=3, element3=0, element5=3. So [3,0,3], but output is [0,3,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is the sum of certain elements from the input. For example, each output cell (i,j) is the sum of the input cells (i*2, j*2), considering that the input is 5 rows and 7 columns, and the output is 3x3. Let's see:\n\nFor Example0, output cell (0,0) would correspond to input cell (0,0) =0. But output is 0. Output cell (0,1) would be input (0,2) =0. But output is 8. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a compression of the input grid. For example, each 3x3 output is created by taking the central parts of the input. But the input is 5x7. The center would be rows 2 and columns 3. Maybe the output's center is the input's center, and surrounding cells are taken from nearby. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the dimensions. The input is 5 rows (0-4) and 7 columns (0-6). The output is 3 rows (0-2) and 3 columns (0-2). So maybe the output is formed by taking specific rows and columns from the input. For example:\n\nOutput rows 0,1,2 correspond to input rows 0,2,4.\n\nOutput columns 0,1,2 correspond to input columns 0,3,6.\n\nLet's check Example0:\n\nInput rows 0,2,4 are:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow4: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nTaking columns 0,3,6 from each:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0 \u2192 output row0: [0,0,0]. But actual output row0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, columns 1,3,5.\n\nRow0: 8,0,8 \u2192 [8,0,8]. Output row0 is [0,8,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: The output's rows correspond to the input's rows 0, 2, 4. For each of these rows, the output's columns are the input's columns 0, 3, 6. Let's check Example3's output:\n\nOutput row0: [4,0,4]. Input row0 (0) columns 0,3,6: 4,0,4. Yes, matches. Output row2: [4,4,4]. Input row4 (4) columns 0,3,6:4,0,4. But output row2 is [4,4,4]. So columns 0,5,6? Because input row4 has [4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. Columns 0 is 4, 5 is4,6 is4. So [4,4,4]. So maybe for the last row (row4) of the input, columns 0,5,6 are taken. For row0, columns 0,3,6. For row2, columns 0,3,6.\n\nBut this varies. Let's check another example. Example1:\n\nInput row0: [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]. Taking columns 0,3,6 gives 2,0,2. Output row0 is [2,2,2]. Doesn't match. So that can't be.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is formed by looking at the first and last elements of certain rows. For instance, each output row is made by the first, middle, and last elements of the corresponding input row. Let's check Example3's row0: [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]. first is4, middle (3rd) is0, last is4. So output row0 is [4,0,4]. Which matches. Example4's output row0 is [0,3,0]. Input row0: [0,3,0,0,0,3,0]. first is0, middle is0, last is0. Output is [0,3,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's look for another pattern. Let's take Example1's output:\n\n[2,2,2]\n[0,2,2]\n[2,0,2]\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,0,0,0,2,2]\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\nRow2: all zeros\nRow3: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0]\nRow4: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nOutput row0: [2,2,2]. Maybe from input row0's elements 0,5,6: 2,2,2. So that's [2,2,2]. Yes! Because row0, columns 0 is2,5 is2,6 is2. So [2,2,2]. That matches. Output row1 is [0,2,2]. Input row1's elements 0,3,6:0,0,2. But output row1 is [0,2,2]. So maybe columns 0,5,6. Row1's 0 is0,5 is0 (since row1 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]), so 0,0,2. Not matching. Or maybe row3's elements. Let's see. Output row1 is [0,2,2]. Maybe input row3's elements 0,5,6:0,2,0. That's [0,2,0], but output row1 is [0,2,2]. Hmm.\n\nExample1's output row2 is [2,0,2]. Input row4's elements 0,5,6:2,0,2. So that would match. So maybe for the first and third output rows, they are taking input row0 and row4's elements 0,5,6. For the middle output row, maybe input row2 (all zeros) and row1 and row3.\n\nWait, in Example1's output row1 is [0,2,2]. Input row2 is all zeros. Input row1's elements 5 is0,6 is2. Input row3's elements 5 is2. So perhaps row1 and row3 are combined. Let's see. Maybe the middle output row is taking elements from input rows 1 and 3. For example, element0 of output row1 is the element0 of input row1 (0). Element1 of output row1 is element5 of input row3 (2). Element2 is element6 of input row1 (2). So combining 0,2,2. That matches [0,2,2]. But this seems arbitrary. Is there a consistent pattern here?\n\nLet's check another example. Example2's input:\n\n[4,4,0,0,0,4,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,4,4]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nOutput:\n\n[4,4,0]\n[0,4,4]\n[4,0,4]\n\nOutput row0: [4,4,0]. Let's see if this is input row0's elements 0,5,6:4,4,0. Yes! So 0th is4, 5th is4,6th is0. So [4,4,0]. Output row2 is [4,0,4], which is input row4's elements0,5,6:4,0,4. Output row1 is [0,4,4]. Which input row's elements? Let's look at input row1: [0,0,0,0,0,4,4]. Elements0,5,6:0,4,4 \u2192 [0,4,4]. Which matches output row1. So for Example2, the output rows are:\n\nRow0: input row0's 0,5,6\nRow1: input row1's 0,5,6\nRow2: input row4's 0,5,6\n\nThis seems to fit. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0's input:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0] \u2192 0,5,6 are0,8,0 \u2192 which matches output row0 [0,8,0].\n\nRow1: [8,8,0,0,0,8,8] \u2192 0,5,6:8,8,8 \u2192 output row1 is [8,8,8].\n\nRow4: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0] \u2192 0,5,6:0,8,0 \u2192 output row2 would be [0,8,0], but actual output row2 is [0,8,0]. Wait, but Example0's output has 3 rows. So row0 is input row0's 0,5,6; row1 is input row1's 0,5,6; row2 is input row4's 0,5,6. But in Example0's output, row2 is [0,8,0], which matches input row4's 0,5,6:0,8,0. Yes. So this fits.\n\nExample3's output:\n\nRow0: input row0's 0,5,6:4,0,4 \u2192 [4,0,4]. Which matches.\n\nRow1: input row1's 0,5,6:0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0]. But Example3's output row1 is [0,0,0]. Yes.\n\nRow2: input row4's 0,5,6:4,4,4 \u2192 [4,4,4]. Which matches.\n\nExample4's output:\n\nRow0: input row0's 0,5,6:0,3,0 \u2192 output row0 is [0,3,0]. Wait, input row0 is [0,3,0,0,0,3,0]. So 0th element is0,5th is3,6th is0 \u2192 [0,3,0]. Which matches output row0.\n\nRow1: input row1's 0,5,6:3,0,3 \u2192 but output row1 is [3,0,3]. Let's check. Input row1 is [3,0,0,0,0,0,3]. 0th is3,5th is0,6th is3 \u2192 [3,0,3]. Output row1 is [3,0,3]. Yes.\n\nRow2: input row4's 0,5,6:0,0,3 \u2192 output row2 is [0,0,3]. Which matches.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern: The output is a 3x3 grid where each row i (i=0,1,2) corresponds to the input's row j (j=0,1,4). Wait, in Example0, the output's row0 is input row0, row1 is input row1, row2 is input row4. But in Example1's output, row0 is input row0 (elements0,5,6:2,2,2), row1 is input row1 (elements0,5,6:0,0,2 \u2192 output row1 is [0,2,2]. But input row1's elements 0,5,6 are 0,0,2. So output row1 is [0,0,2], but in Example1's output row1 is [0,2,2]. Wait, this doesn't fit. So maybe not. Wait, in Example1's input row1 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. elements0,5,6:0,0,2 \u2192 [0,0,2]. But output row1 is [0,2,2]. So this contradicts the pattern.\n\nWait, but Example1's output row1 is [0,2,2]. Let's look at input row3. Input row3 is [0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. elements0,5,6:0,2,0 \u2192 [0,2,0]. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the output rows are formed by taking input rows 0, row1, row4 for the output rows 0,1,2. But in Example1, output row1 is [0,2,2]. So input row1's elements0,5,6 are 0,0,2. But output row1's elements are 0,2,2. So this doesn't fit. So maybe the pattern isn't that straightforward.\n\nBut in Example1, output row1's middle element is 2. Where does that come from? Let's check input row3's element5:2. So maybe output row1 is taking elements from input row3's 5th element. Alternatively, perhaps the output rows are formed as follows: output row0 is input row0's 0,5,6; output row1 is input row3's 0,5,6; output row2 is input row4's 0,5,6. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example1:\n\nInput row3: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. elements0,5,6:0,2,0 \u2192 [0,2,0]. But output row1 is [0,2,2]. So that's not matching. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, output row1 is input row2's elements. But input row2 is all zeros. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Back to Example1's output row1: [0,2,2]. How can this be derived from the input?\n\nInput row1 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. elements5 is0,6 is2. Input row3 is [0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. elements5 is2. Maybe output row1 is combining elements from input rows1 and 3. For example, output row1's elements0 is input row1's element0 (0), element1 is input row3's element5 (2), element2 is input row1's element6 (2). So that gives [0,2,2]. But how to generalize this for all examples?\n\nThis seems a bit too arbitrary. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the output is formed by taking the first three rows and last three rows of the input, but no, the input has five rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's rows correspond to the input's rows 0, 2, 4, and for each of these, take columns 0, 3, 6. Let's check:\n\nExample0:\n\nRows 0,2,4:\n\nRow0:0,8,0,0,0,8,0 \u2192 columns0,3,6:0,0,0 \u2192 output row0:0,0,0. But actual output row0 is [0,8,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1:\n\nRows0: columns0,3,6:2,0,2 \u2192 [2,0,2]. But output row0 is [2,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nNo, that doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: For each output cell (i,j), take the input cell (i*2, j*3). For example:\n\nFor output cell (0,0), input cell (0,0).\n\nOutput cell (0,1), input cell (0,3).\n\nOutput cell (0,2), input cell (0,6).\n\nOutput cell (1,0), input cell (2,0).\n\nOutput cell (1,1), input cell (2,3).\n\nOutput cell (1,2), input cell (2,6).\n\nOutput cell (2,0), input cell (4,0).\n\nOutput cell (2,1), input cell (4,3).\n\nOutput cell (2,2), input cell (4,6).\n\nLet's test this for Example0:\n\nOutput cell (0,0) \u2192 input (0,0)=0 \u2192 matches.\n\nOutput (0,1) \u2192 input (0,3)=0. But output is8. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample0's output (0,1) is8. Input (0,3) is0. So this doesn't work.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output's rows are the first, third, and fifth rows of the input, but the input has only five rows. So rows 0, 2, 4. For each of these rows, take columns 0, 3, 6. Let's see:\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0] \u2192 cols0,3,6:0,0,0 \u2192 output row0:0,0,0. Doesn't match.\n\nExample3:\n\nRow0: cols0,3,6:4,0,4 \u2192 output row0:4,0,4. Matches.\n\nRow2: cols0,3,6:0,0,0 \u2192 output row1:0,0,0. Matches.\n\nRow4: cols0,3,6:4,0,4 \u2192 output row2:4,4,4. No, because input row4's cols0,3,6 are4,0,4. So output row2 would be [4,0,4], but actual output row2 is [4,4,4]. So doesn't fit.\n\nBut Example3's output row2 is [4,4,4], which is input row4's columns0,5,6:4,4,4. So for some examples, columns0,5,6 are taken, others columns0,3,6. Inconsistent.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that for each output row i, the elements are input row j's columns0,5,6, where j is 0 for i=0, 1 for i=1, and 4 for i=2. Let's check:\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0:0,5,6:0,8,0 \u2192 output row0:0,8,0. Correct.\n\nRow1:1,5,6:8,8,8 \u2192 output row1:8,8,8. Correct.\n\nRow4:4,5,6:0,8,0 \u2192 output row2:0,8,0. Correct.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0:0,5,6:2,2,2 \u2192 output row0:2,2,2. Correct.\n\nRow1:1,5,6:0,0,2 \u2192 output row1:0,0,2. But actual output row1 is [0,2,2]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this works for some examples but not others. Example1's output row1 is [0,2,2]. Input row1's 5 is0,6 is2. So [0,0,2]. But output is [0,2,2]. So perhaps the middle element is taken from a different row. For example, output row1's middle element is from input row3's 5. Let's check:\n\nExample1's input row3: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. So row3's 5 is2. So output row1's middle element is2. So output row1 would be [0 (from row1's0), 2 (from row3's5), 2 (from row1's6)] \u2192 [0,2,2]. Which matches.\n\nSimilarly, output row2 is input row4's0,5,6:2,0,2 \u2192 [2,0,2]. Which matches Example1's output row2.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n- Output row0 is input row0's 0,5,6.\n- Output row1 is input row1's0, input row3's5, input row1's6.\n- Output row2 is input row4's0,5,6.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample2's output row1 is [0,4,4]. Input row1's0,5,6:0,4,4 \u2192 which matches. So here, output row1 is input row1's0,5,6. So this contradicts the previous idea. Because in Example2's output row1 is [0,4,4], which is input row1's0,5,6. So maybe the pattern is:\n\nFor output row0: input row0's0,5,6.\n\nFor output row1: input row1's0,5,6.\n\nFor output row2: input row4's0,5,6.\n\nThis works for Example0, Example2, Example3, Example4.\n\nBut in Example1, output row1 is [0,2,2], but input row1's0,5,6 are0,0,2. So according to this pattern, output row1 should be [0,0,2], which doesn't match. So why the discrepancy in Example1?\n\nLooking back at Example1's input and output:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: [2,2,0,0,0,2,2] \u21920,5,6:2,2,2 \u2192 output row0: [2,2,2] \u2192 correct.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2] \u21920,5,6:0,0,2 \u2192 output row1 should be [0,0,2]. But actual output row1 is [0,2,2].\n\nSo this pattern doesn't hold for Example1. This suggests that either there's a different pattern or perhaps an exception. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in Example1's output row1, the middle element is2. Let's look at input row3's5th element. Input row3 is [0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. So element5 is2. So maybe output row1's middle element is taken from input row3's5th element. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are:\n\nrow0: input row0's0,5,6.\n\nrow1: input row3's0,5,6.\n\nrow2: input row4's0,5,6.\n\nChecking Example1's output row1:\n\nInput row3's0,5,6:0,2,0 \u2192 output row1 would be [0,2,0]. But actual output row1 is [0,2,2]. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Let's try to see if there's a different pattern. Let's look at all the examples and see what's common in their transformations.\n\nExample0's output rows:\n\nRow0:0,8,0 \u2192 input row0's 0,5,6:0,8,0. Yes.\n\nRow1:8,8,8 \u2192 input row1's0,5,6:8,8,8.\n\nRow2:0,8,0 \u2192 input row4's0,5,6:0,8,0.\n\nExample1's output:\n\nRow0:2,2,2 \u2192 input row0's0,5,6:2,2,2.\n\nRow1:0,2,2 \u2192 input row1's0,5,6:0,0,2. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut output row1's elements are 0,2,2. So where does the middle 2 come from? Looking at input row3's5th element:2. So maybe row1's middle element is taken from row3's5th element. So for Example1's output row1:0 (from row1's0), 2 (from row3's5), 2 (from row1's6). This would give [0,2,2]. Then the pattern would be:\n\nFor output row0: input row0's0,5,6.\n\nFor output row1: input row1's0, input row3's5, input row1's6.\n\nFor output row2: input row4's0,5,6.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Let's check other examples.\n\nExample2's output row1 is [0,4,4]. According to this pattern, it would be input row1's0 (0), input row3's5 (0, since row3 is all zeros), input row1's6 (4). So [0,0,4]. But actual output is [0,4,4]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This approach isn't working consistently. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the positions of the output elements in the input.\n\nFor example, the output's (0,0) is the input's (0,0), (0,5), (0,6) \u2014 but no. Or perhaps the output's (0,0) is the input's (0,0), (1,0), (4,0) \u2014 sum or max. Let's check Example0's output (0,0) is0. Input's (0,0), (1,0), (4,0) are0,8,0. Max is8. Doesn't fit. Sum is 0+8+0=8. No.\n\nAlternatively, output cell (0,0) is the input cell (0,0). For Example0:0 \u2192 correct. Example1:2 \u2192 correct. Example2:4 \u2192 correct. Example3:4 \u2192 correct. Example4:0 \u2192 correct. So yes, the first element of the output's first row is the first element of the input's first row. Similarly, output's (0,2) is the input's row0's sixth element. Let's check:\n\nExample0's output row0:0,8,0. Input row0's0:0, row0's5:8, row0's6:0. So output row0 is [0,8,0]. Which is input row0's0,5,6.\n\nYes! So output row0 is input row0's0,5,6.\n\nOutput row2 is input row4's0,5,6.\n\nFor output row1, the middle row, what is it? For Example0's output row1: input row1's0,5,6:8,8,8 \u2192 [8,8,8].\n\nExample1's output row1: [0,2,2]. Input row1's0,5,6:0,0,2. But output is [0,2,2]. So the middle element is2 instead of0. Where does this come from? Let's look at input row3's5th element. In Example1's input, row3's5 is2. So output row1's middle element is input row3's5th element. So the output row1 is made up of input row1's0, input row3's5, input row1's6. So [0,2,2].\n\nSimilarly, Example2's output row1 is [0,4,4]. Input row1's0,5,6:0,4,4 \u2192 which fits. But input row3 is all zeros, so input row3's5th element is0. But output row1's middle element is4. So this doesn't fit the previous pattern.\n\nHmm. So for Example0, output row1 is input row1's0,5,6. For Example1, output row1 is input row1's0, input row3's5, input row1's6. For Example2, output row1 is input row1's0,5,6.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that perhaps there's a different approach. Let's re-examine the examples.\n\nWait, in Example1's input, there are 5 rows. The output row1 is [0,2,2]. Looking at input row1's elements: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. So elements0,5,6:0,0,2. But output row1 is [0,2,2]. So perhaps the 2 in the middle comes from another row. Input row3 is [0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. So element5 is2. So output row1's middle element is2. So maybe output row1's middle element is the sum of input row1's5 and row3's5. 0 + 2 =2. But output row1's middle element is2. Similarly, element2 of output row1 is input row1's6:2. So perhaps output row1's elements are:\n\nelement0: input row1's0.\n\nelement1: input row3's5.\n\nelement2: input row1's6.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary. Let's check if this works for other examples.\n\nExample2's output row1 is [0,4,4]. input row1's5 is4, row3's5 is0 (since row3 is all zeros). So 4+0=4. So output row1's element1 is4. Which matches. So output row1's element1 is input row1's5 + row3's5? No, because in Example1, row1's5 is0 and row3's5 is2. Sum is2, which matches. In Example2, row1's5 is4 and row3's5 is0, sum is4. So yes. So maybe output row1's elements are:\n\nelement0: input row1's0.\n\nelement1: input row1's5 + input row3's5.\n\nelement2: input row1's6.\n\nBut in Example0's output row1, input row1's5 is8, row3's5 is8. Sum is16, but output is8. So maybe it's the max of the two. For Example0, row1's5 and row3's5 are both8, so max is8. For Example1, row1's5 is0, row3's5 is2. Max is2. For Example2, row1's5 is4, row3's5 is0. Max is4. For Example3, row1's5 is0, row3's5 is0. Max is0. For Example4, row1's5 is0, row3's5 is0. Max is0. So output row1's element1 is max of row1's5 and row3's5.\n\nBut how to verify this. Let's see:\n\nExample0's output row1: [8,8,8]. Element1 is8. row1's5 is8, row3's5 is8. Max is8. Correct.\n\nExample1's output row1: element1 is2. row1's5 is0, row3's5 is2. Max is2. Correct.\n\nExample2's output row1: element1 is4. row1's5 is4, row3's5 is0. Max is4. Correct.\n\nExample3's output row1: [0,0,0]. row1's5 is0, row3's5 is0. Max is0. Correct.\n\nExample4's output row1: [3,0,3]. row1's5 is0, row3's5 is0. Max is0. But output's element1 is0. Which matches.\n\nSo this seems to fit. So the pattern for output row1 is:\n\nelement0: input row1's0.\n\nelement1: max of input row1's5 and input row3's5.\n\nelement2: input row1's6.\n\nBut wait, in Example0's output row1 is [8,8,8]. element0 is8 (input row1's0), element1 is8 (max of row1's5 and row3's5, both8), element2 is8 (input row1's6). Correct.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nOutput row0: [input row0's0, input row0's5, input row0's6].\n\nOutput row1: [input row1's0, max(input row1's5, input row3's5), input row1's6].\n\nOutput row2: [input row4's0, input row4's5, input row4's6].\n\nYes, this seems to fit all the examples.\n\nLet's verify with Example1:\n\nOutput row0: [2,2,2] \u2192 row0's0,5,6:2,2,2 \u2192 correct.\n\nOutput row1: [0, max(0 (row1's5) and 2 (row3's5)), 2 (row1's6)] \u2192 [0,2,2] \u2192 correct.\n\nOutput row2: [2,0,2] \u2192 row4's0,5,6:2,0,2 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample2's output row1: row1's0=0, max(row1's5=4, row3's5=0)=4, row1's6=4 \u2192 [0,4,4] \u2192 correct.\n\nExample3's output row1: row1's0=0, max(row1's5=0, row3's5=0)=0, row1's6=0 \u2192 [0,0,0] \u2192 correct.\n\nExample4's output row1: row1's0=3 (input row1 is [3,0,0,0,0,0,3]. So row1's0 is3?), wait input row1 for Example4 is [3,0,0,0,0,0,3], so row1's0 is3, row1's5 is0, row3's5 is0 (since row3 is all zeros). So output row1's elements are [3, max(0,0)=0, 3]. But Example4's output row1 is [3,0,3]. Which matches.\n\nYes! So this pattern holds.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- For output row0: take input row0's elements at positions 0,5,6.\n\n- For output row1: take input row1's element0, the maximum of input row1's element5 and input row3's element5, and input row1's element6.\n\n- For output row2: take input row4's elements at positions 0,5,6.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,1,1] \u2192 row0.\n\n[1,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row1.\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row2.\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row3.\n\n[0,1,0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 row4.\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: row0's0,5,6 \u2192 0,1,1 \u2192 [0,1,1].\n\nRow1: row1's0 (1), max(row1's5 (0) and row3's5 (0)) \u2192 max(0,0)=0, row1's6 (0) \u2192 [1,0,0].\n\nRow2: row4's0,5,6 \u21920,0,1 \u2192 [0,0,1].\n\nBut looking at the training examples' outputs, they are all 3x3 grids. For example, Example0's output is:\n\n[0,8,0]\n[8,8,8]\n[0,8,0]\n\nBut according to this pattern, the test output would be:\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the output rows are three elements each. However, let's compare with the training examples to ensure consistency.\n\nBut wait, in the test input, row4's5th element is0 (row4 is [0,1,0,0,0,0,1]), so elements0=0,5=0,6=1. So output row2 is [0,0,1].\n\nBut according to the examples, like Example0's output row2 is [0,8,0], which is row4's0,5,6. So yes.\n\nThus, the test output should be:\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs are:\n\nExample0's output:\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\nWhich corresponds to row0's0,5,6:0,8,0 \u2192 row0: [0,8,0].\n\nRow1's0, max(8,8), row1's6:8 \u2192 [8,8,8].\n\nRow4's0,5,6:0,8,0 \u2192 [0,8,0].\n\nSo yes.\n\nApplying the same to the test input:\n\nRow0's elements0,5,6:0,1,1 \u2192 [0,1,1].\n\nRow1's0 is1, max(row1's5 (0) and row3's5 (0)) is0, row1's6 is0 \u2192 [1,0,0].\n\nRow4's0,5,6:0,0,1 \u2192 [0,0,1].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1]\n\nBut wait, looking at the training examples, the outputs often have a certain symmetry or pattern, but this might vary. Let's check if this matches any training example's structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the pattern. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, in the test input's row1, the elements are [1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So element0 is1, element5 is0, element6 is0. So row1's0 is1, row1's5 is0, row3's5 is0. So the middle element of output row1 is max(0,0)=0. So the output row1 is [1,0,0].\n\nRow4's elements0,5,6:0,0,1. So output row2 is [0,0,1].\n\nSo the final output should be:\n\n[0, 1, 1]\n\n[1, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 1]\n\nBut the training examples often have more of a pattern. For example, Example0's output has a cross shape. But the test output here doesn't necessarily follow a particular shape. However, according to the identified pattern, this should be the correct output.",
