        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input matrices and their corresponding outputs. The goal is to find out how each input is transformed into the output. Let's look at each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput is a 3x3 matrix:\n[6,6,0]\n[0,6,6]\n[0,0,6]\n\nThe output is a 12x12 matrix. The first three rows of the output seem to repeat the input's rows with some pattern. The first row of the output is [6,6,0,6,6,0,6,6,0,6,6,0]. That looks like the original row [6,6,0] repeated four times. Wait, 3 elements repeated 4 times would make 12 elements. But 3*4 is 12, yes. But the second row of the output is [0,6,6,0,6,6,0,6,6,0,6,6], which is the input's second row [0,6,6] repeated four times as well. Similarly, the third row is [0,0,6] repeated four times. Then, the fourth row starts with the first element of the input's first row (6) followed by zeros. Wait, no. Let's check the fourth row: [6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Hmm, that's the first three elements of the input's first row followed by zeros. Then the fifth row is [0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which is the input's second row's first three elements, then zeros. The sixth row is [0,0,6,0,0,0,...], which is the third row's elements. Then the rest of the rows are all zeros. \n\nWait, so maybe the output is constructed by tiling the input matrix in some way, then adding a shifted version below? Let me see. The output's first three rows are the input rows each repeated 4 times (since 3 elements *4=12). Then the next three rows are the first elements of each row followed by zeros. Wait, maybe it's a combination of repetition and then a kind of diagonal shift?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n[0,4,0]\n[0,4,4]\n[4,0,0]\n\nThe output is a 15x15 matrix. The first three rows are the input rows repeated 5 times each (3*5=15 elements). Then the next rows are all zeros except the first part. The fourth row is all zeros except the first three elements. Wait, the fourth row is [0,0,0,0,...], but in Example 0, the fourth row started with [6,6,0], then zeros. Wait, no, in Example 0, the fourth row was [6,6,0,0...]. So maybe after repeating the input rows multiple times horizontally, they are also stacked vertically but shifted? \n\nWait, perhaps the output is created by tiling the input matrix both horizontally and vertically, but with some expansion. Let's check the dimensions. For Example 0's input is 3x3, output is 12x12. 3*4=12. So maybe multiplied by 4 in each dimension. But how? Let's see: the first three rows of the output have each row of the input repeated four times. Then, the next three rows (rows 4-6) are the original input rows but each shifted right by 3 positions, then filled with zeros. Then rows 7-12 are all zeros. Wait, but in Example 0, rows 4-6 are the first row of the input, then second row, then third, but each shifted. Because row 4 is [6,6,0, 0s...], which is the first row of the input followed by zeros. Row5 is the second row followed by zeros, etc. Then rows 7 onwards are all zeros. So the output seems to be the original matrix tiled horizontally 4 times (each row repeated 4 times), then the original matrix's rows placed starting at column 0 but shifted down by 3 rows, but only once, and the rest filled with zeros. But that might not fully explain it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of multiple copies of the input matrix arranged in a certain way. For example, the input is 3x3. The output is 12x12. 12 is 3 *4. So perhaps each row is repeated 4 times, and each column is repeated 4 times? Wait, in Example 0's output, the first three rows are the input rows each repeated 4 times. Then rows 4-6 are the input's rows but each starts at the beginning and then followed by zeros. Then rows 7-12 are zeros. So it's like the original matrix is repeated horizontally 4 times (making each row 12 elements) and then vertically stacked, but after the first three rows, the next three rows are shifted down and left? Maybe not. \n\nLooking at Example 2:\nInput is 3x3:\n[3,0,3]\n[3,0,3]\n[0,3,3]\n\nOutput is 9x9. So 3*3=9. Each row in the output's first 6 rows is the input's rows repeated 3 times. The first three rows are the input rows repeated 3 times. Then rows 4-6 are the same as the first three rows. Then rows 7-9 are zeros. Hmm, but in Example 2's output, the first two rows are [3,0,3,3,0,3,3,0,3], which is the first input row repeated three times. The third row is the third input row repeated three times. Then rows 4-6 are the same as the first three rows. Then rows 7-9 are zeros. Wait, this seems like the input matrix is tiled both horizontally and vertically, but perhaps each tile is a copy of the input. For example, in a 3x3 tiling (since 3*3=9), each tile is the input matrix. But that might not fit because the output's rows are the input rows repeated. Alternatively, perhaps each row of the input is repeated multiple times, then the same for columns. \n\nWait, perhaps the output's rows are formed by taking each row of the input and repeating it N times horizontally, where N is the number of times the input is repeated. Then vertically, the rows are repeated N times, then followed by zeros. For example, in Example 0, N=4. The input is 3 rows, output has 12 rows. 3*4=12. So each original row is repeated 4 times. Then, perhaps, the first 3 rows are the input rows each repeated 4 times, then the next 3 rows are the input rows shifted by one column, then the next shifted again, etc. But looking at Example 0's output, the fourth row is [6,6,0, followed by zeros]. That seems like the first row of the input followed by zeros. Then the fifth row is the second input row followed by zeros. The sixth row is the third input row followed by zeros. Then all remaining rows are zeros. So maybe the output is constructed by first tiling the input rows horizontally (each row repeated 4 times), then placing the input's rows vertically once, then shifted down by 3 positions, but only once. Then fill the rest with zeros. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nIn Example 1, the input is 3x3. The output is 15x15. 15=3*5. So perhaps each row is repeated 5 times. Let's check the first row of Example 1's output: [0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]. Wait, the input's first row is [0,4,0], and in the output's first row, that's repeated 5 times (each [0,4,0] repeated gives 3*5=15 elements, but in the output's first row, after four repetitions (3*4=12 elements) it's [0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0], then three zeros. Wait, that's 12 elements plus three zeros. But 15 elements. So perhaps each row is repeated N times, where N is the input's row length. Wait, maybe the number of repetitions depends on the value in the matrix? Or perhaps the total number of non-zero elements?\n\nAlternatively, looking for another pattern. Let's consider the output matrices. Each output has rows that start with the input rows repeated multiple times, followed by zeros. The number of repetitions seems to vary between examples. For example:\n\nExample 0: Input rows are 3 elements. Output rows are 12 elements. 12/3=4. So each input row is repeated 4 times. Then the next three rows are the input rows but followed by zeros. Then the rest are zeros. Wait, but in Example 0, the fourth row is [6,6,0, 0...], which is the first row of the input, but only once, then zeros. Then the fifth row is the second input row once followed by zeros. Then the sixth row is the third input row once followed by zeros. Then the rest are zeros. So the total rows are 12. So 3 (original rows repeated 4 times) +3 (original rows once) +6 zeros. But 3+3+6=12. Not sure.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the first row is [0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]. So the input's first row [0,4,0] is repeated 4 times (giving 12 elements), followed by three zeros. 4 repetitions + 3 zeros equals 15 elements. Hmm, 15 elements. So perhaps the number of repetitions is (length of output row) divided by input row length. But how is the length determined?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input rows of length 3, output rows of length 12. So 12 /3=4 repetitions. Then the next part. But in Example 1's output rows are 15 elements. 15/3=5. So the input rows are repeated 5 times. But in the first row of Example 1's output, the [0,4,0] is repeated 4 times (4*3=12 elements) plus three zeros. That's 15 elements. So why 4 times and then three zeros? That doesn't fit 5 times. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAnother approach: look for how the output dimensions relate to the input. For example:\n\nExample 0: Input 3x3. Output 12x12. 3*4=12.\n\nExample1: Input 3x3. Output 15x15. 3*5=15.\n\nExample2: Input 3x3. Output 9x9. 3*3=9.\n\nExample3: Input 3x3. Output 18x18. Wait, Example3's output is 18 elements per row. Let me check: the first row is [2,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So 18 elements. 3*6=18. Hmm. So each example's output has row length equal to 3*k, where k is 4,5,3,6 for Examples 0,1,2,3 respectively. What's k related to? Maybe the sum of the input elements or some other property.\n\nLooking at Example0's input sum: 6+6+0 +0+6+6 +0+0+6 = 6*5=30. Wait, k=4. 30 and 4 not directly related. Example1's input sum: 0+4+0 +0+4+4 +4+0+0 = 4+8+4=16. k=5. Not obvious. Example2's input sum:3+0+3 +3+0+3 +0+3+3= (3*2)+(3*2)+(3*2)= 6+6+6=18. k=3. 18/6=3? Not sure. Example3's input sum:2+0+2 +0+2+0 +0+0+0=4+2=6. k=6. Hmm, 6 is the sum. So in Example3, the sum is 6 and k=6. Example0's sum is 30, k=4. Doesn't match. So that's probably not the case.\n\nAlternative approach: look at the elements in the input and see how they might influence the repetitions. For example, in Example3's input, the first row is [2,0,2]. The output's first row is [2,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,2,0,0,0,...], which seems like the row is repeated 3 times (3*3=9 elements) followed by 9 zeros. Wait, but the total row length is 18. 9 elements (3 repetitions) then 9 zeros. So 18 elements. So for Example3, the input's first row is [2,0,2], and in the output, it's repeated 3 times, then 3*3=9 zeros. So maybe the number of repetitions is determined by the first element of the input. For Example0, the first element is 6. 6 mod 3=0? Not sure. Example3's first element is 2, and the row is repeated 3 times. Hmm. Maybe not.\n\nAnother possibility: the number of repetitions is based on the maximum value in the input matrix. For Example0, max is 6. 6 mod 3=0, 6/3=2. Not sure. Example1's max is 4. 4 mod 3 is 1. Example3's max is 2. Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of repetitions is determined by the count of non-zero elements in each row. For Example0's first row has two 6s and a 0. So two non-zero elements. But why would that lead to 4 repetitions? Not obvious.\n\nWait, looking back at the examples:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first three rows are each input row repeated 4 times. Then the next three rows are the input rows but followed by zeros. Then the rest are zeros. The total rows are 12. So 3+3+6=12. But how is the 4 determined?\n\nIn Example1's output, the first three rows are each input row repeated 5 times. The next three rows are the input rows followed by zeros. Then 9 rows of zeros. So 3+3+9=15 rows. So the number of repetitions seems to be (number of output columns)/input columns. For example, in Example0, output columns are 12, input columns 3. 12/3=4. So each row is repeated 4 times. Then for the vertical direction, the input rows are placed again but shifted down by 3 rows (the number of input rows). Then the rest filled with zeros. So for the vertical stacking, it's input rows, then input rows again, but shifted down by 3 rows, then zeros. So total rows would be 3 (original) +3 (shifted) + remaining zeros. So for Example0, 3+3+6=12 rows. \n\nBut how is the number of repetitions determined? The output rows are of length equal to 3*k, where k is the number of repetitions. For example, Example0's output rows are 12 elements. 3*4=12. So k=4. Example1's output rows are 15 elements. 3*5=15. So k=5. Example2's output is 9 elements. 3*3=9. Example3's output is 18 elements. 3*6=18. So what determines k for each example? Let's see:\n\nExample0's input: all elements are 6 and 0. The sum of the first row is 6+6+0=12. 12/3=4. So k=4. Example1's first row sum is 0+4+0=4. 4/3 is not an integer. So that doesn't fit. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the sum of the entire input matrix divided by the number of elements. Example0's total sum is 6*5=30. 30/(3*3) =30/9\u22483.333. Not 4. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum value in the input determines k. Example0's max is 6. 6/3=2. No. Example1's max is4. 4/3=1.333. No. Example2's max is3. 3/3=1. Example3's max is2. 2/3=0.666. Doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the sum of the first row. Example0's first row sum is12 \u219212/3=4. So k=4. Example1's first row sum is4 \u21924/3=1.333. Not. But Example1's k is5. Doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the number of non-zero elements in the input matrix. Example0 has 5 non-zero elements. Not sure. Example0's k is4. 5 and4 not directly related. \n\nAnother angle: looking at the output matrix dimensions. For Example0, output is 12x12. The input is 3x3. So 3*4=12. Example1's output is15x15. 3*5=15. Example2's output is9x9. 3*3=9. Example3's output is18x18. 3*6=18. So the multiplier is k, where for each example, output size is 3k x3k. So k varies per example. For Example0, k=4; Example1, k=5; Example2, k=3; Example3, k=6. \n\nNow, how is k determined for each example? Let's look for a pattern in the input matrices. \n\nExample0 input:\n[6,6,0]\n[0,6,6]\n[0,0,6]\n\nPossible k=4. What's special here? Maybe the sum of the first column:6+0+0=6. 6 divided by something? 6/1.5=4. Not sure.\n\nExample1 input:\n[0,4,0]\n[0,4,4]\n[4,0,0]\n\nk=5. Sum of first column is0+0+4=4. 4/0.8=5. Not helpful.\n\nExample2 input:\n[3,0,3]\n[3,0,3]\n[0,3,3]\n\nk=3. Sum of first column is3+3+0=6. 6/2=3. That fits. So if sum of first column divided by 2 gives k. Let's check other examples. \n\nExample0's first column sum is6+0+0=6. 6/2=3, but k is4. Doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: in Example2's input, the first column sum is6, and k=3. 6/3=2. Not sure. \n\nWait, maybe the value of the first element in the input matrix determines k. Example0's first element is6. 6/3=2 (since input is 3x3). But k=4. No. Example1's first element is0. That can't be. \n\nAlternatively, the number of times the input matrix is tiled both horizontally and vertically. For example, in Example0's output, the input is tiled 4 times horizontally and 4 times vertically. But how? The output's first three rows have each input row repeated 4 times, then the next three rows are input rows but shifted down. Maybe the vertical tiling is 4 copies, but each copy is shifted. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output matrix is constructed by creating a grid where each element from the input is replicated k times in both directions. For example, if each element in the input is expanded into a k x k block in the output. But for Example0, each element is 6 or 0, and k=4. So each element becomes a 4x4 block. That would make the output size 3*4=12 rows and columns. Let's see. \n\nFor Example0's input row [6,6,0], if each element is expanded into a 4x4 block, then the row would be 6 repeated 4 times, then 6 repeated 4 times, then 0 repeated 4 times. So the row would be [6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0], but the actual output row is [6,6,0,6,6,0,6,6,0,6,6,0]. That's different. So that's not the case. \n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by taking the input matrix and replicating it both horizontally and vertically, but each replication is shifted. For instance, for Example0, each row of the input is repeated 4 times horizontally. Then vertically, the rows are replicated, but each time shifted by one position. But looking at the output, the first three rows are the original rows repeated 4 times. Then the fourth row is the first row of the input followed by zeros. So perhaps it's a combination of horizontal repetition and vertical stacking with some overlap. Maybe the input matrix is repeated in a diagonal fashion. For example, the first occurrence is at (0,0), then shifted right by 3 and down by 3 for the next occurrence, but that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is built by placing the input matrix multiple times along the diagonal. For example, in a 4x4 grid of input matrices. But that would give a 12x12 output. Each input matrix is placed at positions (0,0), (3,3), (6,6), (9,9), but that would require 4 placements. But Example0's output first three rows show the input's first row repeated four times, which doesn't fit that idea. \n\nLet's try a different approach. Looking at the output matrices:\n\nIn Example0's output, the first three rows are the input rows repeated four times. The fourth to sixth rows are the input rows followed by zeros. Then all zeros after that. \n\nIn Example1's output, the first three rows are the input rows repeated five times. The fourth to sixth rows are the input rows followed by zeros. Then the rest are zeros. \n\nExample2's output: first three rows are input rows repeated three times. Then rows 4-6 are the same as the first three rows. Then rows 7-9 are zeros. \n\nExample3's output: first three rows are input rows repeated six times. Then the next rows are zeros. \n\nWait, in Example3's input, the third row is all zeros. So in the output, the third row is all zeros. Then in the output, after the first three rows, the rest are zeros. But in Example3's output, the first row is [2,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which is the first input row repeated three times (each repetition is 3 elements) followed by zeros. So 3*3=9 elements plus 9 zeros (total 18). So k=6, since 3*6=18. But why 6? \n\nMaybe the number of repetitions (k) is determined by the sum of the first row of the input. Example0's first row sum is6+6+0=12. 12 divided by something. 12/3=4. Because each element is part of 3 elements. So 12/3=4. So k=4. Example1's first row sum is0+4+0=4. 4/3=1.333. Not matching k=5. Hmm, that's not working. \n\nExample3's first row sum is2+0+2=4. 4/3=1.333. But k=6. No. \n\nAlternatively, maybe k is the maximum value in the input matrix. Example0's max is6. So k=6? But the output rows are length 12. 12=3*4. So not. Example1's max is4, but k=5. Doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's look for another pattern. \n\nIn Example0's output, the first three rows are the input's rows repeated 4 times. The next three rows are the input's rows each followed by 9 zeros (since 12-3=9). Then the remaining 6 rows are zeros. \n\nIn Example1's output, the first three rows are the input's rows repeated 5 times (each row is 3*5=15 elements). Wait, no. In Example1's first row is [0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]. That's the input row [0,4,0] repeated four times (0,4,0 four times would be 12 elements), followed by three zeros. So total 15 elements. So the repetition is 4 times plus some padding. But why 4 times? \n\nSimilarly, in Example3's output, the first row is [2,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. That's the input row [2,0,2] repeated three times (3*3=9 elements) followed by 9 zeros. So total 18 elements. So k=3 for the repetitions, but the output row length is 18. \n\nWait, perhaps the number of times each row is repeated is equal to the maximum value in that row. \n\nExample0's first row: [6,6,0], max 6. So repeated 6 times. But in the output, it's repeated 4 times. So that doesn't fit. \n\nExample3's first row max is2. So repeated 2 times. But in the output, it's repeated three times. No. \n\nAlternatively, the sum of each row. Example0's first row sum is12. 12/3=4. So repeated 4 times. That fits. Example3's first row sum is4. 4/3=1.333, but in output, it's repeated three times. Not matching. \n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output matrix is the input matrix multiplied by a certain factor, but not in the traditional matrix multiplication sense. For example, each element is replaced by a block of size k x k, where k is determined by some rule. Let's check Example0. If k=4, each element becomes a 4x4 block. Then the input 3x3 matrix becomes 12x12. For example, 6 would become a 4x4 block of 6s, 0 would become a 4x4 block of 0s. Let's see:\n\nInput row [6,6,0] would become three blocks: 4 columns of 6, 4 columns of 6, 4 columns of 0. So the first row of the output would be 6,6,6,6, 6,6,6,6, 0,0,0,0. But the actual first row of Example0's output is [6,6,0,6,6,0,6,6,0,6,6,0]. So this doesn't match. So that's not the pattern. \n\nAlternative approach: looking at the positions where the input elements appear in the output. In Example0's output:\n\nThe first three rows are the input rows repeated four times. Then the next three rows have the input's first row at the beginning, followed by zeros. Then the next three rows (rows 7-9) are all zeros. \n\nWait, this looks like the input matrix is first tiled horizontally four times, then vertically once. Then, after that, the input matrix is shifted down by three rows and tiled once, but only the first three rows of that shifted tile are present. Then the rest is filled with zeros. \n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the input matrix being repeated in both dimensions, but with some overlap. But I'm not seeing it clearly. \n\nLooking at Example2's output:\n\nThe output is 9x9. The first three rows are each input row repeated three times. Rows 4-6 are the same as the first three rows. Rows 7-9 are zeros. So this looks like the input matrix is tiled both horizontally and vertically three times. But wait, if the input is 3x3, tiling three times would be 9x9. But the output has the first six rows as two repetitions of the input's rows. Then zeros. That doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each row of the input is repeated k times vertically. For Example2, each row is repeated twice. So 3 rows \u00d72=6 rows. Then the remaining 3 rows are zeros. But the output has 9 rows. So that's not matching. \n\nAnother pattern: the output matrices have a certain number of non-zero rows followed by zero rows. For Example0, first 6 rows have non-zero elements, then 6 zero rows. Example1: first 3 rows have non-zero, then 3 rows, then 9 zeros. Example2: first 6 rows, then 3 zeros. Example3: first 3 rows, then 15 zeros. So the number of non-zero rows varies. \n\nPerhaps the number of non-zero rows is determined by the number of non-zero rows in the input multiplied by some factor. For example, the input has 3 non-zero rows. Example0's output has 6 non-zero rows (3\u00d72), Example1's output has 6 non-zero rows (3\u00d72), Example2's output has 6 non-zero rows (3\u00d72), Example3's output has 3 non-zero rows (3\u00d71). But how is the factor determined?\n\nAlternatively, the non-zero rows in the output are the original input rows repeated horizontally, then the input rows shifted down by the number of rows and placed again. For Example0, after the first three rows (input rows repeated), the next three rows are the input rows shifted down by 3 rows and placed once. Then zeros. So the total non-zero rows are 3+3=6. The factor is 2. How is this factor determined? Maybe it's the maximum value in the input divided by some number. Example0's max is6. 6/3=2. Example1's max is4. 4/2=2. So factor is 2. Example2's max is3. 3/1.5=2. Hmm, not sure. Example3's max is2. 2/1=2. But in Example3's output, there's only 3 non-zero rows. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let's think about the following: For each row in the input, the output repeats the row multiple times horizontally, and then appends zeros until the row reaches a certain length. The number of repetitions and the appended zeros might depend on the sum or other properties of the row. \n\nFor example, in Example0's first row sum is12. Maybe 12/3=4 repetitions. So 4 times the row, which gives 12 elements. So no zeros appended. But in Example1's first row sum is4. 4/3=1.333. So perhaps floor(4/3)=1 repetition, but that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, the number of repetitions is equal to the sum of the row. Example0's first row sum is12 \u219212/3=4. So 4 repetitions. Yes. Example3's first row sum is4. 4/3=1.333. But in Example3's output, the first row is repeated 3 times. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAnother idea: the number of times a row is repeated is determined by the sum of its elements. For example, Example0's first row sum is12, so repeated 12/3=4 times (since each repetition is 3 elements). Example3's first row sum is4, which would give 4/3=1.333. But in the output, it's repeated 3 times. So maybe ceiling of sum divided by 3? For Example3's first row sum4, ceiling(4/3)=2. But output shows 3 repetitions. Doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the number of repetitions is the maximum value in the row. Example0's first row max is6. So repeated 6 times. But output shows 4 repetitions. No.\n\nAnother approach: For each row in the input, the output row is formed by repeating the row as many times as the number of non-zero elements in that row. For Example0's first row has two non-zero elements (6,6). So repeated 2 times. But the output row is repeated4 times. Doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the number of non-zero elements in the entire input. Example0's input has 5 non-zero elements. 5+3=8. Not sure. \n\nI'm stuck. Let's look for another pattern. The output for each example seems to have a structure where the input is repeated multiple times, then followed by zeros. The number of repetitions and the zeros vary. Let's look at the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n[0,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nThe output needs to be generated. Let's assume the pattern is that each row of the input is repeated k times, and the output has rows of length 3*k, followed by zeros. Then, the number of rows is also 3*k. \n\nBut how to find k? For the Test Input:\n\nInput rows:\nRow1: [0,0,8] sum=8.\nRow2: [0,8,0] sum=8.\nRow3: [0,0,0] sum=0.\n\nWhat's k for this input? If we take the sum of the first row divided by 3, 8/3=2.666. Ceiling would be3. So k=3. Then each row would be repeated3 times, leading to 3*3=9 elements per row. Then the output would have 9 rows. But looking at the examples:\n\nExample0 had k=4 (sum of first row 12/3=4), leading to 12x12.\n\nExample1's first row sum is4, 4/3=1.333, but k=5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k is determined by the sum of the entire input matrix divided by the number of elements. For the Test Input, the sum is8+8+0=16. Number of elements is9. 16/9\u22481.777. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum value in the input. Test Input's max is8. So 8/2=4. Not sure. \n\nLooking back at the examples, maybe k is the sum of the first row. For Example0, sum is12, k=4. 12/3=4. For Example3, first row sum is4, k=6. Wait, no. Example3's output row length is18, which is3*6. So 18/3=6. But why is k=6 for Example3? The first row sum is4. \n\nAlternatively, the sum of the entire first row multiplied by some factor. This is not clear. \n\nWait, looking at Example3's input:\n\n[2,0,2]\n[0,2,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nThe output rows are 18 elements. So k=6. Why 6? The first row sum is4, second row sum is2. \n\nAnother observation: in the output matrices, the number of times the input rows are repeated seems to be related to the total number of non-zero elements in the input. \n\nExample0's input has 5 non-zero elements. Example0's k=4. 4*3=12 elements per row. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the sum of all elements in the input. Example0's sum is30. 30/5=6. Not sure. \n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think about the Test Input. The input is:\n\nRow1: [0,0,8]\nRow2: [0,8,0]\nRow3: [0,0,0]\n\nAssuming that the pattern is to repeat each row k times horizontally and then vertically, and the number of zeros appended depends on k. Let's look at the possible output. For the Test Input, what would be the expected output?\n\nIn Example0's input, which has a row with [6,6,0], the output's first row is that repeated4 times. So for the Test Input's first row [0,0,8], maybe it's repeated 8 times. Because the element is 8. But 8 *3 =24 elements per row. Which would make the output 24x24. But the examples don't show such a pattern. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum value in the input determines k. Test Input's max is8. So k=8. So each row is repeated 8 times. Then the output would be 3*8=24 elements per row, and 3*8=24 rows. But the examples don't support this. \n\nExample0's max is6, and k=4. 6/1.5=4. Not sure. \n\nWait, another idea. Looking at the output matrices' rows: the number of times the input row is repeated in the output's row equals the number of non-zero elements in that row. \n\nExample0's first row has two non-zero elements (6,6). Output row is repeated4 times. Doesn't fit. \n\nExample1's first row has one non-zero element (4). Output row is repeated4 times. Hmm, but 4 repetitions. \n\nExample3's first row has two non-zero elements (2,2). Output row is repeated3 times. \n\nNo, this doesn't fit. \n\nI'm really stuck. Let's try to look for another pattern. \n\nAnother observation: In Example0's output, the first three rows are the input rows repeated four times. The fourth row is the first input row followed by zeros. The fifth row is the second input row followed by zeros. The sixth row is the third input row followed by zeros. Then zeros. So maybe the output is the input matrix repeated horizontally k times, then vertically once, then shifted down by the number of input rows and repeated once, but only the first part. \n\nFor example, in Example0:\n\nk=4. So each row is repeated4 times horizontally. Then, vertically, the input is stacked once, then the input is stacked again but shifted down by 3 rows (the number of input rows), and then the rest is zeros. \n\nSo total rows would be 3 (original) +3 (shifted) +6 (zeros) =12. \n\nFor the Test Input, if k is determined by some rule, perhaps the same as Example0's pattern, where k is determined by the sum of the first row divided by the number of elements. \n\nTest Input's first row sum is8. 8/3\u22482.666. Maybe k is ceil(8/3)=3. So each row is repeated3 times. \n\nThen the first three rows of the output would be:\n\n[0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8] (3 repetitions of first row)\n[0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0] (3 repetitions of second row)\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (third row is zeros, repeated three times)\n\nThen the next three rows would be:\n\n[0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0] (first row followed by zeros)\n[0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (second row followed by zeros)\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (third row followed by zeros)\n\nThen the remaining rows (up to 9 rows) are zeros. \n\nBut according to the examples, the output's row length is 3*k. For k=3, row length is9. The number of rows would be 3*k=9. So the output would be 9 rows. \n\nBut let's check the examples to see if this aligns. \n\nExample2's input has a sum of first row 6 (3+0+3=6). 6/3=2. But k=3. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the Test Input's first row has a max value of8. Maybe k=8. But then the row length would be3*8=24. \n\nAlternatively, the number of times each row is repeated in the output is equal to the sum of that row divided by the number of elements in the row (3). \n\nFor the Test Input's first row sum is8. 8/3\u22482.666 \u2192 rounds up to3. So repeated3 times. Second row sum8/3=2.666\u21923 times. Third row sum0\u21921 time (but in examples like Example3's third row is all zeros, which is repeated six times). Hmm, not sure. \n\nBut if we proceed with this assumption, the Test Input's output would be:\n\nEach row of input is repeated3 times. So:\n\nFirst row: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8] (3 repetitions)\nSecond row: [0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0]\nThird row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThen the next three rows would be the input rows shifted down by3 rows:\n\nFourth row: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nFifth row: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nSixth row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThen the remaining three rows are zeros. \n\nSo the output would be 9x9 matrix:\n\n[0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8]\n[0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut in the training examples, especially Example3, the third row (all zeros) is repeated the same number of times as the other rows. So perhaps the third row is also repeated k times. \n\nBut in this Test Input case, the third row is zeros. So even if k=3, it's repeated three times, but followed by zeros. Hmm, but in Example3's output, the third row is zeros and is repeated three times followed by zeros. \n\nBut according to the pattern observed in the examples, each row of the input is repeated k times horizontally, then the same rows are placed again vertically, shifted by the number of input rows. But for the Test Input, if k=3, then the output row length is9, and the vertical stacking would be 3 input rows, then 3 shifted rows, then 3 zeros. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nIn the Test Input, the first row has an 8. Looking at Example0 where the first row had 6s and k=4, Example1 where the first row had 4 and k=5. Not directly related. \n\nAlternatively, the number of repetitions is the sum of the first row. For the Test Input, sum is8. So k=8. So each row is repeated8 times. That would make the row length 3*8=24. The output would be 24 rows. \n\nBut how would that look? The first row would be [0,0,8] repeated8 times. But the examples don't show this. \n\nAlternatively, the number of repetitions is the maximum value in the row. For the Test Input's first row, max is8. So repeat 8 times. So row length 3*8=24. But the examples don't support this. \n\nAnother observation: the sum of the first row in Example0 is12, which is the row length of the output (12). The sum of the first row in Example3 is4, but the output row length is18. Doesn't fit. \n\nAt this point, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern where each row of the input is repeated k times horizontally, and the number of rows in the output is also k times the input rows, but filled with zeros after a certain point. \n\nLooking at Example0's input rows: 3. Output rows:12. 3*4=12. So k=4. So each row is repeated4 times, and there are 4 times the rows, but the extra rows are zeros. \n\nFor the Test Input, if k is 8 (the maximum value in the input), then each row is repeated8 times, making the output row length 24. The number of rows would be 3*8=24. \n\nBut how to verify this. Let's imagine:\n\nFirst three rows of the output would be:\n\nRow1: [0,0,8,0,0,8,... 8 times]\nRow2: [0,8,0,0,8,0,... 8 times]\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,... 8 times]\n\nThen the next rows would be the input rows shifted down by3 rows, but that's speculative. \n\nBut this approach seems to fit the examples. For Example0, k=4 (max 6?), but not. \n\nAlternatively, k is the maximum value in the entire input. For Test Input, max is8. So k=8. \n\nThus, each row is repeated8 times horizontally. The output has 3*8=24 rows. The first three rows would be the input rows repeated8 times. Then the next 21 rows would be the input rows shifted down by3 positions each time, but filled with zeros. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples, the number of times each row is repeated horizontally seems to be the same for all rows, and the vertical repetition is the same. \n\nGiven that I'm time-constrained, I'll proceed with the assumption that the pattern is to repeat each row of the input k times horizontally, where k is the sum of the first row divided by 3 (rounded up or down). For Test Input, first row sum is8. 8/3\u22482.666\u2192k=3. So each row is repeated3 times horizontally, leading to 9 elements per row. Then vertically, the input rows are repeated3 times, leading to 9 rows. \n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8]\n[0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut this is a 9x9 matrix. However, looking at Example3's input where the third row is all zeros, the output still repeats that row six times, followed by zeros. So perhaps the number of repetitions is determined by the sum of the entire input matrix. \n\nTest Input's sum is8+8=16. 16/3\u22485.333. So k=5. \n\nBut this is a shot in the dark. \n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the assumption that each row is repeated k times, where k is the sum of the first row divided by 3. For Test Input, sum is8, so k=8/3\u22482.666\u21923. \n\nThus, the Test Input's output would have rows of 9 elements (3*3), and 9 rows. The first three rows are the input rows repeated3 times. The next three rows are the input rows followed by zeros. Then three rows of zeros. \n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8]\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this aligns with the examples. For instance, Example3's first row sum is4, which would lead to k=1.333\u21921. But in Example3's output, the first row is repeated3 times. \n\nAlternatively, the number of repetitions is the sum of the entire input matrix divided by 3. For Test Input, sum is16. 16/3\u22485.333. So k=5. \n\nThis would lead to rows of length 15 (3*5) and 15 rows. \n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Given the time, I'll proceed with the earlier assumption and generate an output based on k=3.",
