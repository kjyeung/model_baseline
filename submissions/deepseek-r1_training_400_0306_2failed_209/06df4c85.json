        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of lists (arrays) of numbers, and the output seems to modify some of those numbers. The key is to see how the input arrays are transformed into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has several rows. Let's compare the input and output. For instance, in row 3 of the input, the original is [0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0]. The output changes some of the zeros between the 8s. Specifically, the positions around the 2s are modified. Like, the 0s after the first 2,2 become 2,2. Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal row 3 input: [0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0]\nOutput row 3: [0,0,8,2,2,8,2,2,8,2,2,8,2,2,8,2,2,8,0,0]\nOh, right! So between the 8s, where there were 0s, they replaced them with the same numbers as the previous non-zero pair. So after the first 2,2, the next 0,0 becomes 2,2. Then the next 0,0 after that 8 becomes 2,2 again. So it's like propagating the non-zero pairs to the right in the same row, but only between the 8s.\n\nWait, maybe it's more about symmetry. Let's see another example. In Example 1, the input row 3 starts with [0,0,1,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,4,4,1...], and the output changes the zeros after the 2,2 to 2,2. Similarly, other rows have similar changes where the non-zero pairs are replicated in subsequent sections separated by the main number (8,1,4 in the examples). \n\nAnother observation: the main number (like 8 in Example 0, 1 in Example 1, 4 in Example 2) seems to act as a separator. Between these separators, any non-zero pair (like 2,2) in the input is propagated to the right in the same row. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input row 3 again: the non-zero pairs (2,2) are at positions 3-4. Then after the 8, there are 0s. In the output, those 0s become 2,2, then again after the next 8, etc. So it's like each non-zero pair in a segment (between 8s) is replaced by the first non-zero pair in that row. Wait, no. Because in row 6 of Example 0's input: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,1,1,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0], the output becomes [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,1,1,8,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0]. Here, the last part 0,0,8 becomes 2,2,8. But where does the 2,2 come from? Oh, wait, in the input, the row 3 had 2,2. But maybe the propagation is within the same row but in specific positions. Hmm, perhaps the rule is that whenever there's a non-zero pair (like 2,2) in a certain position, that pair is copied to other positions in the same row where there are zeros between the same separators.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that any non-zero pair in a row is replicated in all the subsequent segments (between the main number) of that row. For example, if a row has a non-zero pair in the first segment after the initial zeros, then all other segments in that row (i.e., between the main numbers) get the same non-zero pair. But how does that apply to the examples?\n\nIn Example 0's input row 3, the first non-zero pair after 8 is 2,2. The output changes all the subsequent 0,0 segments between 8s to 2,2. So the output row 3 becomes 0,0,8,2,2,8,2,2,8,2,2,8,2,2,8,2,2,8,0,0. So each segment between 8s after the initial 2,2 is filled with 2,2.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's input row 3, the non-zero pairs are 2,2 and 4,4. But in the output, the 2,2 is propagated to the right. Let me check:\n\nInput row 3 in Example 1: [0,0,1,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,4,4,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]\nOutput row 3: [0,0,1,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,4,4,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0] \u2192 wait, no. Wait, the output for Example 1's row 3 is the same as input. Wait, no, in Example 1, the output rows 3 and 4 are the same as input. But looking at other rows, like row 6 and 7 in the input. Input row 6: [0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]. The output row 6 becomes [0,0,1,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]. Wait, that's different. Oh, no. Wait, the output row 6 in Example 1 is [0,0,1,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]. So the 2,2 is inserted where there were zeros. So maybe the pattern is that the first non-zero pair in a row determines the values for all the subsequent segments in that row.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, row 3's output propagates the 2,2 to the right. Similarly, in Example 1's row 6, the 2,2 from row 3 is being used? Or maybe each row's non-zero pairs are propagated to the right in their own row. But how? Let me check:\n\nIn Example 0's row 3: the first non-zero pair is 2,2. Then in the output, all the 0,0 between the 8s after that are replaced with 2,2. So the rule is that once a non-zero pair is encountered in a row, all subsequent 0,0 pairs between the same separator (like 8) are replaced with that non-zero pair. But wait, in the same row, perhaps. So each segment between the main number (like 8) in a row is filled with the first non-zero pair in that row. So if a row has a non-zero pair in one segment, all subsequent segments in that row (before the next main number) get the same pair.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 6, the input has [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,1,1,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0], and the output changes the last 0,0 before the 8s to 2,2. Wait, where does the 2,2 come from here? Because in this row, the first non-zero pair is 1,1. But the output in row 6 is [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,1,1,8,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0]. So the last 0,0 becomes 2,2. But the 2,2 wasn't present in this row. Hmm, this complicates things. So maybe the pattern is not per row but across the entire structure. Maybe the non-zero pairs are being propagated in some other way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern involves looking at the positions of the non-zero pairs in the input and mirroring them in some way. For example, if a non-zero pair appears in a certain position in a row, then in the output, that pair is replicated in other positions that are in the same \"column\" group. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input row 3: the 2,2 is at positions 3-4. In the output row 3, the 2,2 is also at positions 6-7, 9-10, 12-13, 15-16. So every time there's a 8 (the main number), the next two positions after it (after the 8) are filled with 2,2. But in the input row 3, the initial 8 is followed by 2,2, but the subsequent 8s are followed by 0,0. So the output replaces those 0,0s with 2,2s. So the rule here is: for each row, after the first occurrence of a non-zero pair (like 2,2), all subsequent segments (after each 8) in that row are filled with that same pair.\n\nBut then in Example 0's row 6, the input has a 1,1 pair. The output for that row is [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,1,1,8,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0]. So the 2,2 appears again here. But where does that come from? Because the 2,2 was in row 3, not row 6. That suggests that the pattern might not be per row but perhaps per some other grouping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero pairs are being copied downward. For example, if a non-zero pair is present in a row, then in the rows below, when there's a 0,0 in the same position, it's replaced with that pair. But that doesn't seem to fit all examples.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 2. The input row 3 is [0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0]. The output row 3 is [0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0], which is the same as the input. Wait, no. Wait in the output for Example 2, the input and output for row 3 are the same. But looking at other rows. For example, row 6 in Example 2's input is [0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0]. The output row 6 becomes [0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0]. So here, the 3,3 from row 3's input is being inserted into row 6's output. So maybe the pattern is that any non-zero pair in a row affects the rows below it, inserting the same pair into the same positions where there are zeros.\n\nBut how does that work? For instance, in Example 0's row 6, the output has 2,2, which comes from row 3. So maybe whenever a non-zero pair (like 2,2) appears in a row, any row below that (until another non-zero pair in the same column positions) will have those positions filled with the same pair if they were zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a matter of each non-zero pair in a row propagates to the right and downward. For example, if a pair is introduced, it's replicated in all subsequent segments (between main numbers) in the same row and also in the same columns in the rows below.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to find a consistent rule.\n\nLooking at all examples:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- The first non-zero pairs in rows 3 and 4 are 2,2. In the output, all the segments in those rows after the initial 2,2 are filled with 2,2. Then in row 6 and 7, the first non-zero pair is 1,1, and the next segments in those rows are filled with 2,2. Wait, but why 2,2 here? Because in row 6's output, the last segment is 2,2. So maybe the pattern is that once a non-zero pair is introduced in any row, it's applied to all subsequent rows in the same columns. But that's not exactly clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero pairs are part of a grid structure, and each time a pair is placed, it affects all the same positions in the rows below, but only until another pair is placed in that position.\n\nAlternatively, considering the structure of the arrays: each array has a main number (like 8, 1, 4) that repeats, and between them are pairs. The non-zero pairs in the input are being replicated in all the same positions across the array in the output.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that for each occurrence of a non-zero pair in the input, the output duplicates that pair in all the corresponding positions in the same row. For example, in Example 0's row 3, the first occurrence of 2,2 leads to all subsequent 0,0 pairs in that row (after each 8) being replaced with 2,2. Similarly, in Example 1's row 10, the 9,9 pair is propagated to other segments in that row.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the positions of the non-zero pairs in the input and see how they spread in the output.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput row 3: positions 3-4 are 2,2. Output row 3: positions 6-7, 9-10, 12-13, 15-16 all become 2,2. So after each 8, the next two elements are 2,2. So the 8s act as separators, and the 2,2 is placed between each 8 in that row.\n\nSimilarly, in row 6 of Example 0's input, there's a 1,1 pair. In the output, the next segments after 8 are 0,0, but the last segment becomes 2,2. Hmm, that's confusing. Why would the 2,2 appear there?\n\nWait, in row 6's output, the last segment (positions 15-16) are 2,2. Looking back, row 3's output has 2,2 in those positions. So maybe the 2,2 from row 3 is being carried over to row 6's output in the same columns. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that any non-zero pair introduced in a row affects all subsequent rows in the same columns. So once a pair is placed in a column position, all zeros in those columns in lower rows are replaced with that pair until another non-zero pair overwrites it.\n\nIn Example 0's row 3, columns 3-4 have 2,2. Then, in row 6's columns 15-16 (which correspond to a later segment), those are also 2,2. But how are the columns aligned? Maybe each segment (between main numbers) corresponds to the same column positions in different rows. For example, if a pair is in the third segment of a row, it affects the third segments in other rows.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's try to find a general rule.\n\nLooking at all examples, it seems that whenever there's a non-zero pair (like X,X) in a row between the main numbers, then in the output, all the subsequent pairs in the same row between the main numbers are replaced with X,X. Also, in rows below, if there's a zero pair in the same position, it's replaced with X,X until another X,X is introduced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the first non-zero pair in that row is propagated to all the subsequent segments in that row. So for example, in Example 0's row 3, the first pair is 2,2, so all the following segments in that row become 2,2. In row 6, the first non-zero pair is 1,1, so all following segments would be 1,1, but in the output, the last segment is 2,2, which contradicts this. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. Let's re-examine Example 0's row 6 input and output. Input row 6: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,1,1,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]. Output row 6: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,1,1,8,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0]. The last segment (positions 15-16) is 0,0 in input and 2,2 in output. But why 2,2 here? The first non-zero pair in row 6's input is 1,1. So if the rule was to propagate that, the output would have 1,1 in subsequent segments. But instead, it's 2,2, which comes from row 3's 2,2. So maybe there's a vertical propagation as well.\n\nAnother possibility: the non-zero pairs in the input are mirrored in the output in all possible positions where they could form a symmetrical pattern. For example, if a pair is present in a row, it's mirrored in other rows in a certain way. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main number (like 8) forms a grid, and the non-zero pairs are being filled in a way that creates a larger pattern. Like, each non-zero pair is part of a vertical column that gets filled downward.\n\nBut let's look at Example 2's input and output. Input row 3 has [0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0]. Output row 3 is the same. But in row 6 of the output, it's [0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0]. Wait, no. Example 2's output row 6 is [0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0]. So the 3,3 from row 3 is present in row 6's output. So perhaps when a non-zero pair is in a certain column, all rows below that in the same columns have those pairs replicated if they were zeros.\n\nSo for example, once 3,3 is introduced in row 3, any zeros in the same columns in lower rows are replaced with 3,3. But in Example 0's row 6, the 2,2 from row 3 is being used in the same columns as where 2,2 was in row 3. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's row 3, the first 2,2 is at positions 3-4. Then, in row 6's output, the last 2,2 is at positions 15-16. That's not the same columns. So that theory doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero pairs are being propagated in a diagonal manner. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of another approach. The main numbers (8,1,4) are forming a grid, separating the pairs. Each segment between two main numbers is a cell. The input may have certain cells filled with non-zero pairs, and the output fills other cells in the same row with those pairs.\n\nSo for example, in Example 0's row 3, the first cell (after the initial zeros and 8) is 2,2. The output fills all the following cells in that row with 2,2. Similarly, in row 6, the cell with 1,1 in the input results in the following cells in that row being filled with 1,1. But in the output, row 6's last cell is 2,2. This contradicts.\n\nWait, but looking at Example 0's output row 6, the input has 1,1 in one cell, and the output has 2,2 in another cell. So perhaps there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each cell (between main numbers) that has a non-zero pair in any row causes all cells in the same column (across rows) to be filled with that pair. For example, if a cell in row 3 has 2,2, then all cells in the same vertical position (same position between main numbers) in lower rows are filled with 2,2 unless they have their own non-zero pair.\n\nIn Example 0's row 3, the first cell (after the initial 8) has 2,2. Then in row 6, the same cell (positions 3-4) are 0,0 in input but become 0,0 in output. Hmm, but that's not the case. So that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero pair in a row is propagated to the same cell in all subsequent rows until another pair is encountered. For example, in Example 0's row 3, the first cell is 2,2. All cells below that in the same position (same cell) become 2,2 unless another pair is present. But in row 6, that cell is 0,0 in input and remains 0,0 in output. So that's not the case.\n\nThis is getting quite challenging. Let's try to look for a common transformation in all examples.\n\nAnother observation: the outputs seem to have more non-zero pairs than the inputs. The transformation is adding non-zero pairs to the output based on some rule related to the input.\n\nLooking at the first example:\n\nIn Example 0's input row 3: the input has 2,2 in one segment, and the output has 2,2 in all segments of that row. Similarly, in row 6, the input has 1,1 in one segment, and the output has 2,2 in another segment. Wait, but where does the 2,2 come from? It seems like the 2,2 from row 3 is affecting row 6's output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero pair in the input is propagated to all occurrences of the same number (like 8) in the entire structure. For example, if there's a pair after an 8 in any row, all other 8s in the same column positions across all rows get that pair. But this is getting too vague.\n\nWait, perhaps the main number (8,1,4) is acting as a vertical separator. For example, each main number forms columns, and the pairs between them are part of those columns. So any non-zero pair in a column is filled down. For example, in Example 0, the first 8 is followed by 0,0 in row 0. But in row 3, after the first 8, there's 2,2. Then, in the output, all rows after row 3, in the same column (after the first 8) would have 2,2. But looking at the output rows, that's not the case. Row 0's first 8 is followed by 0,0 in the output.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of it as a grid where each row has a series of segments separated by the main number. Each segment is a pair of numbers. In the input, some segments have non-zero pairs. In the output, all segments in the same row as the first non-zero pair are replaced with that pair. \n\nFor example, in Example 0's row 3: the first segment after the initial 8 is 2,2. All other segments in that row become 2,2 in the output. Similarly, in Example 1's row 3: the first segment after 1 is 2,2, so all others in that row are 2,2. But in Example 1's row 6: the first segment after 1 is 0,0, but the output changes it to 2,2. So maybe the pattern is that once a non-zero pair appears in any row, all subsequent segments in the same row and column are filled with that pair.\n\nWait, in Example 1's row 6: the input is [0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]. The output is [0,0,1,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]. So the first segment after 1 is replaced with 2,2. But where does the 2,2 come from? It comes from row 3's 2,2. So the rule might be that the first non-zero pair in a column (vertical position between main numbers) is propagated down to all rows below in that column. So any time a column has a non-zero pair, all rows below that in the same column get that pair unless there's a new pair.\n\nIn Example 0's row 3, the first column after the initial 8 has 2,2. All rows below that in the same column (after the first 8) would have 2,2. For example, in row 6's first segment after 8, it's 0,0 in input, but in output, it's 0,0 (wait, no). Wait, in Example 0's output row 6: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,1,1,8,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0]. The first segment after 8 is 0,0, not 2,2. So that contradicts that theory.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let me try to approach this differently. Perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the non-zero pairs are copied to the right in the same row, replacing any 0,0 pairs that come after them. For example, if a row has a non-zero pair, then all the 0,0 pairs to the right in that row are replaced with that pair.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 6, the input has 1,1 in the fourth segment. The output has 2,2 in the sixth segment. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero pair in the input is duplicated in all positions where their indices modulo some number align. For example, if a non-zero pair is at positions i and i+1, then all other positions j and j+1 where j \u2261 i (mod n) are replaced with that pair. But I'm not sure what n would be.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could involve the main number being a separator, and each pair after the main number represents a 'cell'. For each cell, if any row has a non-zero pair, then all cells in the same column (same position relative to the main number) in the output have that pair. So for example, if the third cell (after the third main number) in any row has a non-zero pair, then all cells in the third position across all rows get that pair.\n\nLooking at Example 0's row 3: the first cell (after the first 8) is 2,2. In the output, all other rows' first cell after 8 would have 2,2. But in row 0's first cell after 8, it's 0,0 in output. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell's non-zero pair is propagated to the right in the same row and down in the same column. For example, once a pair is introduced in a cell, all cells to the right in the same row and down in the same column are filled with that pair.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 3, the first cell is 2,2. The cells to the right in that row are filled with 2,2. The cells below in the same column (row 6, same cell) are 0,0 in input and output. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. Let's look for a different angle. Maybe the output is filling in the mirror image of the non-zero pairs. For example, if a non-zero pair is present in a certain position, the mirror position (relative to the center) is filled with the same pair. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, the main numbers form a grid, and the non-zero pairs are forming a diamond or other shape. But I don't see such a pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the first example's output: in row 3, the pairs 2,2 are replicated in each segment after each 8. So the rule here is that once a non-zero pair appears in a row, all the segments in that row after the main number are filled with that pair.\n\nSo, for each row in the input:\n\n- If the row contains any non-zero pairs (X,X), then in the output, every segment (between the main numbers) in that row is filled with the first such X,X pair encountered in that row.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's row 3, the first non-zero pair is 2,2, so all segments in that row are filled with 2,2.\n\nIn Example 0's row 6, the first non-zero pair is 1,1. So all segments in that row should be filled with 1,1. But in the output, the last segment is 2,2. So this theory is invalid.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's output row 6: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,1,1,8,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0]. The first non-zero pair is 1,1, but the last segment is 2,2. That doesn't fit. So this theory is wrong.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the non-zero pairs in the input are shifted to the right by a certain number of positions. For example, in Example 0's row 3, the 2,2 is at positions 3-4, and in the output, they are at 3-4, 6-7, etc. So it's replicating the same pair every three positions (since the main number 8 is at position 2,5, etc.). But how?\n\nAlternatively, each main number is followed by two digits. If those two digits are non-zero, then in the output, all main numbers in that row are followed by those two digits. So the rule is: for each row, replace all pairs after each main number with the first non-zero pair in that row.\n\nThis seems to fit Example 0's row 3. Input row 3 has 2,2 as the first non-zero pair, so all pairs after 8s in that row become 2,2.\n\nIn Example 0's row 6: the first non-zero pair is 1,1, but the output has 2,2 in the last segment. So this contradicts. Unless there's another rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the first non-zero pair in the entire input is propagated to all applicable positions. But in Example 0, the first non-zero pair is 8,8 in row 2, but that's the main number. The next non-zero is 2,2 in row 3. But that doesn't explain row 6's output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero pairs from previous rows are used in subsequent rows. For example, once a non-zero pair is introduced in a row, it's used in all lower rows where the same positions are zeros.\n\nIn Example 0's row 3 introduces 2,2. Then, in row 6's output, the last segment is 2,2, which is borrowed from row 3. But why that particular segment?\n\nAlternatively, the segments in each row correspond to the same columns as in previous rows. For example, the first segment after the first main number in row 3 is 2,2. Any row below that in the same column (first segment after main number) will have 2,2 if they are zeros. But looking at row 6's first segment, it's 0,0 in input and output, so that's not the case.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Let's try to look for a pattern in the test input.\n\nThe test input's first few rows are:\n\n[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n...\n\nLooking at row 3 and 4 in the test input, there's a 8,8 pair. Following the pattern from previous examples, perhaps in the output, all segments in those rows will be filled with 8,8. But wait, in the training examples, non-zero pairs are propagated within the same row. So if the first non-zero pair in row 3 is 8,8, then all segments in that row would become 8,8. But in the test input's row 3, the first non-zero pair is 8,8. So in the output, all segments after each 4 in that row would become 8,8. But let's see:\n\nOriginal row 3 in test input: [0,0,4,0,0,4,8,8,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0]. The first non-zero pair is 8,8. So according to the pattern from previous examples, all segments after each 4 in that row would become 8,8. So the output row 3 would be:\n\n[0,0,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, when a row has multiple non-zero pairs, perhaps only the first one is used. For instance, in row 3 of the test input, there's also a 2,2 pair later. So maybe the first non-zero pair in the row determines the fill for all segments in that row. So the output for row 3 would have all segments filled with 8,8, overwriting the 2,2.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's row 3, the input has 2,2 and other zeros, and the output fills all with 2,2. Similarly, Example 1's row 3 has 2,2 and 4,4, but the output doesn't propagate the 4,4. So the rule is that only the first non-zero pair in a row is used to fill all segments in that row.\n\nSo applying this to the test input's row 3: the first non-zero pair is 8,8. Therefore, all segments in that row after each 4 would become 8,8. The existing 2,2 would be replaced with 8,8.\n\nBut wait, the test input's row 3 also has a 2,2 pair later. If the rule is to fill all segments with the first non-zero pair, then the 2,2 would become 8,8.\n\nSimilarly, in row 19 of the test input: [0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0]. The first non-zero pair is 2,2. So all segments in that row would become 2,2.\n\nBut let's look at the other examples to confirm this.\n\nIn Example 2's input row 3: [0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0]. The first non-zero pair is 3,3. The output row 3 is the same as the input, which suggests that this theory is incorrect. Wait, but in Example 2's output, other rows have changes. For example, row 6's input is [0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0], and the output is [0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0]. So the first non-zero pair in row 6's input is 0,0, but the output has 3,3. So the 3,3 comes from row 3's input.\n\nAh, so maybe the pattern is that for each row, the first non-zero pair in any previous row at the same segment position is used to fill the current row's segment if it's zero.\n\nBut how to determine the segment position. For example, in the test input's row 3, the first segment after the first 4 is 0,0. Then the second segment after the second 4 is 8,8. In the output, perhaps all segments in that row would be filled with 8,8, as it's the first non-zero pair.\n\nBut in Example 2's row 6, the first segment after the first 4 is 0,0, but the output has 3,3. Which comes from row 3's first segment after the first 4 (3,3). So perhaps the rule is that each segment (defined by its position relative to the main numbers) inherits the first non-zero pair from any row above in the same segment position.\n\nSo for example, if segment 1 (after the first main number) in row 3 is 3,3, then all lower rows' segment 1 will have 3,3 unless they have their own non-zero pair.\n\nIn Example 2's row 6's segment 1 (after the first 4) is 0,0 in input. So in the output, it's replaced with 3,3 from row 3's segment 1.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 0's row 6's last segment (segment 5) is 0,0 in input and becomes 2,2 in output. The 2,2 comes from row 3's segment 5 (which was 2,2 in input).\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each segment (the space between two main numbers) in each row:\n\n- If the segment in the input has a non-zero pair, keep it.\n- If the segment in the input is 0,0, look upwards in the same segment position (same column) for the first non-zero pair and use that.\n\nThus, the output for each segment is the first non-zero pair found when moving up from that segment's position. If none found, it remains 0,0.\n\nLet's test this against the examples.\n\nIn Example 0's row 3, segment 1 (after first 8) is 2,2. So all lower rows' segment 1 would have 2,2 unless they have their own pair.\n\nIn row 6 of Example 0, segment 1 is 0,0 in input. So in output, it would look up to row 3's segment 1 (2,2) and use that. But in the output, row 6's segment 1 remains 0,0. Wait, this contradicts. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the propagation is downward. Once a non-zero pair is placed in a segment, all segments below it in the same column are filled with that pair.\n\nIn Example 0's row 3, segment 1 has 2,2. All rows below row 3 in segment 1 would have 2,2. But row 6's segment 1 is 0,0 in input and output. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let's try to look at another example. Example 2's row 3 has segment 1 as 3,3. In row 6's output, segment 1 is 3,3, even though the input was 0,0. So this suggests that the output is taking the first non-zero pair from above in the same segment.\n\nSo the rule is: for each segment (column), if there's a non-zero pair in any row above, the segment in the current row is filled with that pair. Otherwise, it remains 0,0.\n\nThis explains Example 2's row 6's output. The segment 1 is 0,0 in input, but in the output, it's 3,3 from row 3's segment 1.\n\nIn Example 0's row 6's segment 5 (the fifth occurrence between 8s) in input is 0,0. Looking up in segment 5's column, the first non-zero pair is in row 3's segment 5, which is 2,2. So in the output, row 6's segment 5 becomes 2,2.\n\nThis seems to fit. Let's verify with Example 0's row 6:\n\nInput row 6: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,1,1,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nSegments after each 8:\n\nSegments positions:\n\nSegment 0: after first 8: 0,0 (positions 3-4)\nSegment 1: after second 8: 0,0 (positions 6-7)\nSegment 2: after third 8: 0,0 (positions 9-10)\nSegment 3: after fourth 8: 1,1 (positions 12-13)\nSegment 4: after fifth 8: 0,0 (positions 15-16)\nSegment 5: after sixth 8: 0,0 (positions 18-19)\n\nOutput row 6: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,1,1,8,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0]\n\nSegment 4 in output is 2,2. Looking up segment 4 in previous rows, row 3's segment 4 is 2,2 (input row 3: [0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0]. The segments after each 8 are:\n\nSegment 0: 2,2\nSegment 1: 0,0\nSegment 2: 0,0\nSegment 3: 0,0\nSegment 4: 2,2\n etc.\n\nSo row 3's segment 4 is 2,2. Thus, in row 6's segment 4 (which is 0,0 in input), the output uses the first non-zero pair from above, which is 2,2 from row 3.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's row 6:\n\nInput row 6: [0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nSegments after each 1 are:\n\nSegment 0:0,0\nSegment 1:0,0\nSegment 2:0,0\nSegment 3:0,0\nSegment 4:0,0\nSegment 5:0,0\n\nOutput row 6: [0,0,1,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nSegment 0 in output is 2,2. Looking up segment 0 in previous rows, row 3's segment 0 is 2,2. So in the output, row 6's segment 0 is 2,2.\n\nThis seems to fit the pattern. Thus, the rule is: for each segment (the pairs between the main numbers), if there is a non-zero pair in any row above in the same segment position, then the current segment's 0,0 is replaced with that pair.\n\nSo the transformation is to fill each 0,0 segment with the first non-zero pair found above it in the same segment position.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input has several rows. For example, in row 3:\n\n[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nSegments after each 4:\n\nSegment 0:0,0 (positions 3-4)\nSegment 1:0,0 (positions 6-7, but here it's 8,8. Wait, the main number is 4. Wait, the structure may have different main numbers. For example, the main number here is 4. So the segments are the pairs between 4s.\n\nBut in row 3 of the test input, after the first 4 comes 0,0 (segment 0), then another 4, then 8,8 (which is a non-main number pair?), but the main number is 4. So perhaps the main number is 4, and the segments are between the 4s.\n\nBut wait, the structure in the test input seems to have 4 as the main number, so the segments are between 4s.\n\nThus, in row 3 of the test input, the segments are:\n\nAfter first 4: 0,0 (segment 0)\nAfter second 4: 8,8 (segment 1)\nAfter third 4:0,0 (segment 2)\nAfter fourth 4:0,0 (segment 3)\nAfter fifth 4:2,2 (segment 4)\nAfter sixth 4:0,0 (segment 5)\nAfter seventh 4:0,0 (segment 6)\n\nBut according to the main number being 4, the segments are between the 4s. So any pair between two 4s is a segment. However, the 8,8 here is between two 4s, so it's part of a segment. But according to the previous examples, the main number is the separator, and the pairs between them are the segments. So in row 3 of the test input, segment 1 is 8,8 (non-zero pair), and segment 4 is 2,2.\n\nApplying the rule: for each segment in the row, if it's 0,0, look up in previous rows for the first non-zero pair in the same segment position and use that.\n\nFor example, in row 3's segment 0 (0,0), but there's no previous row in the test input above row 3 with a non-zero pair in segment 0. So it remains 0,0.\n\nSegment 1 in row 3 is 8,8 (non-zero), so it stays.\n\nSegment 2 is 0,0. Looking up, previous rows (rows 0-2) in segment 2 are 0,0, 0,0, and 4's main row (which is all 4s). So no non-zero pairs. So segment 2 remains 0,0.\n\nSegment 3 is 0,0. Looking up, no non-zero pairs. So remains 0,0.\n\nSegment 4 is 2,2. Stays.\n\nSegments 5 and 6 are 0,0. No previous non-zero pairs. So remain 0,0.\n\nNow, looking at row 19 in the test input:\n\n[0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0]\n\nSegments:\n\nAfter first 4:2,2 (segment 0)\nAfter second 4:0,0 (segment 1)\nAfter third 4:0,0 (segment 2)\nAfter fourth 4:0,0 (segment 3)\nAfter fifth 4:2,2 (segment 4)\nAfter sixth 4:0,0 (segment 5)\nAfter seventh 4:0,0 (segment 6)\n\nIn the output, for segment 0, it's 2,2 (non-zero), so stays.\n\nSegment 1:0,0. Looking up previous rows, in row 3, segment 1 is 8,8. So segment 1 in row 19's output would become 8,8.\n\nSegment 2:0,0. Looking up, in previous rows, maybe row 9 has a non-zero pair in segment 2? Let's check the test input. Row 9 and 10 have:\n\n[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0]\n\nIn row 9 and 10, the last segment (after the seventh 4) is 3,3. So segment 6 in row 9 and 10 is 3,3.\n\nSo for row 19's segment 2:0,0. Looking up, any previous rows with non-zero in segment 2? Let's see. For example, row 3's segment 2 is 0,0. Row 9's segments:\n\nAfter first 4:0,0 (segment 0)\nAfter second 4:0,0 (segment 1)\nAfter third 4:0,0 (segment 2)\nAfter fourth 4:0,0 (segment 3)\nAfter fifth 4:0,0 (segment 4)\nAfter sixth 4:0,0 (segment 5)\nAfter seventh 4:3,3 (segment 6)\n\nSo segment 2 in row 9 is 0,0. Thus, row 19's segment 2 remains 0,0 unless there's a non-zero pair in a higher row. If no, it remains 0,0.\n\nBut perhaps I need to apply this rule to each segment in the test input.\n\nOverall, the pattern is that each 0,0 segment in the output is replaced with the first non-zero pair found in the same segment position in any of the previous rows.\n\nSo for the test input, applying this rule:\n\nLooking at row 3's segments:\n\n- Segment 0:0,0. No previous non-zero, remains 0,0.\n- Segment 1:8,8. Stays.\n- Segment 2:0,0. No previous, remains 0,0.\n- Segment 3:0,0. No previous, remains 0,0.\n- Segment 4:2,2. Stays.\n- Segments 5 and 6:0,0.\n\nRow 4 is the same as row 3.\n\nRow 9 and 10 have segment 6:3,3.\n\nSo in rows below row 9 and 10, any segment 6 with 0,0 will be replaced with 3,3.\n\nFor example, in row 19's segment 6:0,0. Looking up, row 9's segment 6 is 3,3. So in the output, row 19's segment 6 becomes 3,3.\n\nSimilarly, in row 19's segment 1 (0,0) will be replaced with 8,8 from row 3's segment 1.\n\nPutting this together, the output for the test input would have:\n\nFor each row:\n\n- Each segment is either the original non-zero pair or the first non-zero pair from above in the same segment.\n\nApplying this to the entire test input, the output would replace all 0,0 segments with the first non-zero pair found in the same segment position from any previous row.\n\nSo, for the test input, the final answer would have:\n\nIn row 3 and 4, the segments 1 are 8,8. So any segments below in the same position (segment 1) with 0,0 would become 8,8.\n\nIn rows 9 and 10, segment 6 is 3,3. So any segments below in segment 6 with 0,0 would become 3,3.\n\nIn row 19, segment 0 has 2,2 (original), segment 1 is 0,0 \u2192 replaced with 8,8 from row 3. Segment 4 is 2,2 (original). Segment 6 is 0,0 \u2192 replaced with 3,3 from row 9.\n\nThus, the output for row 19 would be:\n\n[0,0,4,2,2,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,2,2,4,8,8,4,3,3,4,0,0]\n\nBut the test input's row 19 is:\n\n[0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nApplying the rule:\n\n- Segment 0: 2,2 (stays)\n- Segment 1:0,0 \u2192 replace with first non-zero from above. The first non-zero in segment 1 is 8,8 from row 3.\n- Segment 2:0,0. No non-zero above in segment 2.\n- Segment 3:0,0. No non-zero above.\n- Segment 4:2,2 (stays)\n- Segment 5:0,0. No non-zero above.\n- Segment 6:0,0. Replaced with 3,3 from row 9.\n\nSo the output row 19 would be:\n\n[0,0,4,2,2,4,8,8,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0]\n\nBut this is just a part of the entire output. Applying this process to all rows in the test input would generate the complete output.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples. Then apply that to the test input. Let me start by looking at the examples closely.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input has several lines. Let's compare the input and output. Take the fourth line of input: [0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0]. The output changes some of the zeros to 2s. Specifically, the positions around the 8s. Like, the 0s after the first 8 in positions 6-7 become 2,2. Similarly, other sections. So maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a number (like 2) next to an 8, it propagates that number in certain directions? Or maybe there's a duplication of the numbers in adjacent positions where there were zeros.\n\nIn Example 1, the input line [0,0,1,0,0,1,...] in the output, certain 0s become 2s or other numbers. For instance, in the input line where there's a 9, the output spreads those 9s further. Like in the lines starting with [0,0,1,9,9,1...], the output has more 9s in subsequent positions. So maybe the rule is that when there's a pair of numbers (like 2,2 or 9,9), they cause adjacent zeros to turn into the same numbers in certain positions.\n\nAnother observation: The lines that have all 8s (or 1s, 4s, etc.) in the input remain unchanged in the output. So those lines are probably separators. The transformation occurs in the lines that have zeros and other numbers. The key is to look at those lines with numbers other than the separator lines.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input line [0,0,4,3,3,4...] in the output, some zeros after the 3,3 become 3s. Like the input line becomes [0,0,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,...]. So it seems like when there's a pair of numbers (like 3,3) next to a separator (4), those numbers spread to adjacent zeros in the same line, maybe in both directions.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's input line [0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,8...], the output changes those zeros after the 2,2 to 2,2. So the pattern could be that whenever a pair of numbers (like 2,2) is followed by a separator (8) and then zeros, those zeros are replaced by the same pair. So the pairs are propagating through the line, replacing zeros that are adjacent to the separator. So perhaps each time a number pair is next to the separator, the zeros on the other side of the separator are replaced by the same pair.\n\nWait, maybe the structure is that the lines with all the same number (like 8,8,8...) are acting as vertical separators. The lines between them are rows. Each row has elements separated by the separator number. So each segment between separators is a block. The transformation might be that if a block in a row has a pair (like 2,2), then in the output, all other blocks in the same row (separated by the separator) also get that pair. But wait, in Example 0, the input row has a 2,2 in one block, and in the output, other blocks in the same row get 2,2 as well. So maybe the rule is that any non-zero pair in a row's block is copied to all other blocks in that row.\n\nWait, let's check. In Example 0's input row 3 (0-based?), which is the fourth line of input: [0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0]. The output is [0,0,8,2,2,8,2,2,8,2,2,8,2,2,8,2,2,8,0,0]. So each block (between the 8s) that was [0,0] becomes [2,2]. Except the first and last blocks, which are [0,0,8...] and [...8,0,0]. Wait, no, the first block is before the first 8. Hmm. Wait, the structure here is that the 8s are separators. So the line is divided into segments separated by 8s. Each segment is a group. So in the input line, the groups are:\n\n- [0,0] (before first 8)\n- [2,2] (after first 8, before next 8)\n- [0,0] (next group)\n- [0,0]\n- [2,2]\n- [0,0]\n\nBut in the output, all the middle groups (except maybe the first and last) are replaced with [2,2]. Wait, the output groups are:\n\n- [0,0]\n- [2,2]\n- [2,2]\n- [2,2]\n- [2,2]\n- [0,0]\n\nSo the first and last groups remain [0,0], but the middle ones become [2,2]. How does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that when a group in a row has a non-zero pair, all other groups in that row (except possibly the first and last) are replaced with that pair. But how is the first and last determined? Or perhaps the non-zero pair is propagated to adjacent groups in the same row.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input row 3, there are two groups with [2,2]: the second and fifth groups. In the output, all the groups between them are filled with [2,2]. Wait, but the output shows that all the groups except the first and last are [2,2]. So maybe the first and last groups are the edges and are not changed, but the inner groups are filled with the non-zero pairs present in that row.\n\nBut how do we determine which pair to use if there are multiple? For example, in Example 1's input, there's a line with 4,4 and 9,9. Let me check Example 1's output. In Example 1's input line 9 (the 10th line), the input is [0,0,1,9,9,1...], and the output becomes [0,0,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,1...]. So the 9,9 is propagating to all subsequent groups. Similarly, in the same example's line 12 (input [0,0,1,0,0,1...8,8,1...]), the output has 8,8 in the last group. So maybe the rule is that the leftmost non-zero pair in the row determines what the other groups become, but only if they are between the first and last non-zero pairs?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero pair in the row is used to fill the adjacent groups. For example, if a group has a non-zero pair, then the groups to the left and right of it (but within the same row) are replaced with that pair. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, think of each row as being divided into blocks separated by the separator number (like 8 in Example 0). Each block is a sequence of numbers between the separators. The transformation seems to replace some of the blocks with the non-zero pairs present in the input row. For example, in Example 0's input row 3, the blocks are:\n\n0,0 | 2,2 | 0,0 | 0,0 | 2,2 | 0,0\n\nThe output becomes:\n\n0,0 | 2,2 | 2,2 | 2,2 | 2,2 | 0,0\n\nSo the first and last blocks remain 0,0. The middle blocks (those between the first and last) are replaced with the non-zero pair (2,2) found in the input. But how are the first and last determined? Maybe the first and last blocks are not part of the transformation. Only the inner blocks are replaced with the non-zero pairs.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input row 3, the first block is [0,0], then after the first 8 comes [2,2], then some 0s, then another [2,2]. The output fills all the inner blocks (between the first and last) with [2,2]. So perhaps any non-zero pair in the row causes all the inner blocks to be replaced with that pair.\n\nBut then in Example 1, looking at the input line where there's a 9,9 pair, the output propagates it to other groups. For instance, in line 9 of Example 1's input, the input has [0,0,1,9,9,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,4,4,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]. The output changes the next groups after the 9,9 to also have 9,9. So the output becomes [0,0,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9]. Wait, but in the actual output, it's [0,0,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9]. So the 9,9 spreads to all subsequent groups in that row except the first and last. So perhaps the rule is that all inner blocks (those not at the very start or end) are replaced with the first non-zero pair found in the row.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's row 3, there are two 2,2 pairs in the input. The output fills all inner blocks with 2,2. So maybe the presence of any non-zero pair in a row causes all inner blocks to be that pair, regardless of how many there are. So the first non-zero pair in the row determines what the inner blocks become.\n\nBut how about when there are multiple different pairs in the same row? Let's check Example 2's input. In Example 2, the input line 3 is [0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0]. The output for this line is [0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0]. Wait, but in the output of Example 2, the line becomes [0,0,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0]. Wait, no, looking at the actual example, the input line 3 in Example 2's input is [0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0], and the output line is [0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0]. Wait, no, maybe I'm looking at the wrong lines. Let me check again.\n\nWait, Example 2's input line 3 is [0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0]. The output for that line in Example 2 is [0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0]. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting the lines wrong. Let me check the actual example.\n\nExample 2's input line 3 (assuming lines start at 0):\n\nThe third input line is [0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0].\n\nThe output line is [0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0]. Wait, but looking at the provided output for Example 2, line 3 is part of the output's third line, which is [0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, no, looking at Example 2's output, the third line (after the separators) is the same as the input. Wait, no. Wait, in Example 2's output, line 3 is:\n\n[0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nWhich matches the input. Wait, but looking at other lines. For example, line 6 in the input of Example 2 is [0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0]. The output line 6 is [0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0]. Wait, that's different. So there must be another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied to certain rows. For instance, rows that have non-zero pairs in certain positions. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nThe input line with 2,2 in positions 3-4 and 15-16. The output line replaces the 0s between those positions with 2,2 in each block. So from the first 2,2, the 2s spread to the right until the next 2,2. So perhaps the rule is that between the first occurrence of a non-zero pair and the next occurrence of the same pair in the same row, all the blocks in between are filled with that pair.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each time a non-zero pair is encountered in a row, all the subsequent blocks (until another non-zero pair) are filled with that pair. But that doesn't explain all cases.\n\nAnother approach: Compare the input and output of each example line by line.\n\nTake Example 0, input line 3:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8, 2, 2, 8, 2, 2, 8, 2, 2, 8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0]\n\nSo the 2,2 pairs are placed in all the blocks between the first and last occurrence of 2,2. The blocks between them are filled with 2,2. So the first occurrence is at block 2 (after the first 8), then block 5 (counting starting from 0?), but in the output, all the blocks between the first and last 2,2 are filled with 2,2.\n\nBut in the input, the blocks after the first 2,2 are 0,0, then 0,0, then 2,2. So in the output, the blocks between the first and last 2,2 are filled with 2,2.\n\nSo the rule could be: For each row, if there are non-zero pairs, then the blocks between the first and last occurrence of non-zero pairs are filled with the first non-zero pair in that row.\n\nBut how about when there are different pairs? Like in Example 2's input line 3, which has 3,3 and 2,2. The output line 3 is the same as the input. But in other lines, like line 9 in Example 2's input: [0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0]. The output line 9 becomes [0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,0,0]. Wait, but according to the example's output, line 9 in Example 2's output is [0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0]. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the line numbers wrong. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 2's input:\n\nLine 9 (assuming lines start at 0) is:\n\n[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0]\n\nOutput line 9 is:\n\n[0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0]\n\nWait, this seems like the 3,3 from a previous line (line 3) is propagating into line 9. But that's not possible. Maybe the transformation is per row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves looking at the previous rows. For example, when a pair is introduced in a row, it propagates downward. But the examples show that the transformation is applied per row, not across rows.\n\nAnother angle: The separator lines (all 8s, 1s, etc.) remain unchanged. The other lines (the non-separator lines) are transformed. Each non-separator line is divided into blocks separated by the separator number. For example, in Example 0's line 3, the blocks are separated by 8s. Each block has two elements. The transformation replaces certain blocks with the non-zero pairs from the same row.\n\nIn Example 0's line 3, the input has two non-zero blocks (2,2 and another 2,2). The output replaces all the blocks between them with 2,2, and leaves the first and last blocks (which are 0,0) as is.\n\nSo the rule could be: For each non-separator row, if there are any non-zero pairs in the blocks, then the blocks between the first and last non-zero pair are replaced with the first non-zero pair's value. Any blocks after the last non-zero pair remain as in the input.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's line 3, the output replaces the blocks between the first 2,2 and the last 2,2 with 2,2. The blocks before the first 2,2 and after the last 2,2 remain as 0,0.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Split the row into blocks separated by the separator number (8 in Example 0).\n\n2. Find all blocks that have non-zero pairs.\n\n3. If there are any non-zero pairs, then for all blocks between the first and last non-zero pair, replace them with the first non-zero pair's value.\n\n4. Leave the blocks before the first and after the last non-zero pair as they are.\n\nSo applying this to Example 0's line 3:\n\nBlocks are:\n\n0: [0,0]\n\n1: [2,2]\n\n2: [0,0]\n\n3: [0,0]\n\n4: [2,2]\n\n5: [0,0]\n\nNon-zero pairs are at blocks 1 and 4. So between them (blocks 2,3) are replaced with 2,2. So blocks 1-4 become 2,2. But the output shows that all blocks between first and last (blocks 1 to 4) are filled with 2,2. So the output blocks are:\n\n0: [0,0]\n\n1: [2,2]\n\n2: [2,2]\n\n3: [2,2]\n\n4: [2,2]\n\n5: [0,0]\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's line 9 input:\n\nBlocks (separated by 1s):\n\n0: [0,0]\n\n1: [9,9]\n\n2: [0,0]\n\n3: [4,4]\n\n4: [0,0]\n\n5: [0,0]\n\nNon-zero pairs are 1: [9,9], 3: [4,4]. So the first non-zero is 9,9 (block 1), last non-zero is 4,4 (block 3). So the blocks between them (block 2) would be replaced with 9,9. But the output shows that the blocks after the first non-zero (9,9) are all replaced with 9,9. Hmm, perhaps the rule is different.\n\nWait, in Example 1's line 9 input, the output line is:\n\n[0,0,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9]\n\nSo the blocks after the first 9,9 are all replaced with 9,9. So blocks 2,3,4,5 are filled with 9,9. But according to the previous rule, the first non-zero is block 1, and the last non-zero is block 5 (if any), but in the input, there's no other non-zero after block 3. Hmm, maybe I need to look again.\n\nWait, in Example 1's line 9 input:\n\nThe input is [0,0,1,9,9,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,4,4,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nSo blocks are:\n\n0: [0,0]\n\n1: [9,9]\n\n2: [0,0]\n\n3: [0,0]\n\n4: [4,4]\n\n5: [0,0]\n\n6: [0,0]\n\n7: [0,0]\n\nWait, perhaps the separator is 1, so the line is split into blocks separated by 1s. The input line has:\n\n0: before first 1: [0,0]\n\nBlock 1: after first 1: [9,9]\n\nBlock 2: next 1: [0,0]\n\nBlock 3: next 1: [0,0]\n\nBlock 4: next 1: [4,4]\n\nBlock 5: next 1: [0,0]\n\nBlock 6: next 1: [0,0]\n\nBlock 7: next 1: [0,0]\n\nSo the non-zero pairs are in blocks 1 and 4. According to the previous rule, the blocks between 1 and 4 (blocks 2,3) would be filled with 9,9, and block 4 remains as 4,4. But the output line shows that after block 1, all blocks until the end are filled with 9,9. But in the output line, the blocks after 9,9 are all 9,9, including block 4. That contradicts the earlier rule.\n\nWait, the output line for Example 1's line 9 is:\n\n[0,0,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9,1,9,9]\n\nSo the blocks are:\n\n0: [0,0]\n\n1: [9,9]\n\n2: [9,9]\n\n3: [9,9]\n\n4: [9,9]\n\n5: [9,9]\n\n6: [9,9]\n\n7: [9,9]\n\nBut the input's block 4 was [4,4]. So the output replaced even block 4's 4,4 with 9,9. That suggests that the rule is that once a non-zero pair is encountered, all subsequent blocks in that row are filled with that pair, overwriting any existing pairs. That would mean the first non-zero pair in the row determines the filling of all subsequent blocks.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's line 3, there are two 2,2 pairs. According to this rule, after the first 2,2, all subsequent blocks become 2,2. But in that case, the second 2,2 in the input would be replaced, but in the output, it's still there. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that all blocks after the first non-zero pair are filled with that pair, regardless of what's there. So in Example 1's line 9, the first non-zero pair is 9,9 in block 1. All subsequent blocks (2,3,4,5,6,7) are replaced with 9,9. Even if block 4 had 4,4 in the input, it's overwritten to 9,9. That fits the example.\n\nIn Example 0's line 3, the first non-zero pair is 2,2 in block 1. All subsequent blocks (2,3,4,5) are replaced with 2,2. But block 4 in the input also has 2,2, which remains as 2,2. So the output would be blocks 0: 0,0; 1:2,2; 2:2,2; 3:2,2; 4:2,2; 5:0,0. Which matches the output. So the rule could be: For each row, after the first non-zero pair (in the order of the blocks), all subsequent blocks are replaced with that pair. But blocks before the first non-zero pair remain as is, and any block after the first non-zero pair is replaced with the first non-zero pair.\n\nBut in Example 0's line 3, the last block (block 5) is [0,0], but according to this rule, it's after the first non-zero pair and should be replaced. But in the output, block 5 is 0,0. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. So this can't be the rule.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for the exact positions where changes occur.\n\nIn Example 0's input line 3, the output changes the 0s at positions 6-7, 8-9, 10-11, 12-13 to 2,2. These positions are after the first 8 (separator) where the 2,2 is located. So perhaps the non-zero pairs are spreading to the right, filling the next blocks.\n\nIn Example 1's line 9, the 9,9 pair in block 1 causes all blocks to the right to become 9,9.\n\nIn Example 2's line 9 input: [0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0]. The output line 9 becomes [0,0,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,0,0]. Wait, here the first non-zero pair is 3,3 in block 1 (from a previous line?), but in this line's input, the first non-zero pair is 2,2 in block 4 and 8. So according to the output, the 3,3 is coming from somewhere else. Wait, this suggests that maybe the transformation isn't row-based but involves some vertical propagation.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nAlternative hypothesis: The transformation is that each non-zero pair in a row is copied to all positions to the right and left in the same row, bounded by the separator numbers. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the non-zero pairs act as \"seeds\" and fill all possible positions to the left and right until the next non-zero pair. For example, in Example 0's line 3, the first 2,2 fills to the right until another 2,2 is encountered. So the area between the two 2,2 pairs is filled with 2,2. But in the output, all the area between the first and last 2,2 is filled with 2,2. So that's like connecting the first and last non-zero pairs and filling everything in between.\n\nBut in Example 1's line 9, the first non-zero pair is 9,9, and there's no other non-zero pair in that row. So all blocks to the right are filled with 9,9.\n\nAnother example: In Example 1's line 12 input: [0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,8,8,1,0,0]. The output is [0,0,1,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,8,8,1,0,0]. Wait, no, looking at the actual example, in Example 1's line 12 input, the output line 12 is [0,0,1,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,8,8,1,0,0]. So the first non-zero pair is 2,2 in block 1, and the last non-zero pair is 8,8 in block 6. So the blocks between them are filled with 2,2? But in the output, block 6 is 8,8. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero pair in a row causes all subsequent blocks to be filled with that pair. So once a non-zero pair is encountered, all blocks to the right (in the same row) are replaced with that pair.\n\nIn Example 0's line 3:\n\nInput blocks: 0:0,0; 1:2,2; 2:0,0; 3:0,0; 4:2,2; 5:0,0.\n\nOutput blocks: 0:0,0; 1:2,2; 2:2,2; 3:2,2; 4:2,2; 5:0,0.\n\nThis suggests that after the first 2,2 (block 1), all subsequent blocks (2,3,4) are filled with 2,2, but block 5 (after the last 2,2) is left as 0,0. That doesn't fit the hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first non-zero pair in the row is used to fill all blocks to the right until the end of the row. But in Example 0's line 3, after the first 2,2, blocks 1-4 are filled, and block 5 is left. But that's not the case. The output has block 5 as 0,0.\n\nHmm. Maybe the first and last blocks are not modified, and the inner blocks are filled with the first non-zero pair found in the row.\n\nBut in Example 0's line 3, the first block is 0,0 (not modified), then the inner blocks (1-4) are filled with 2,2, and the last block (5) is 0,0.\n\nIn Example 1's line 9, the first block is 0,0, then the inner blocks (1-7) are filled with 9,9, and the last block (7) is 9,9. But according to the output, the last block is 9,9, which is part of the inner blocks. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The transformation is that each non-zero pair in a row is mirrored on both sides. For example, in Example 0's line 3, the two 2,2 pairs are mirrored, filling the space between them. But that's not exactly the case.\n\nAlternatively, the non-zero pairs act as boundaries. The area between the first and last non-zero pair is filled with the first non-zero pair's value.\n\nIn Example 0's line 3, the first non-zero is at block 1, last at block 4. The blocks between are filled with 2,2. The blocks before block 1 and after block 4 are left as is.\n\nIn Example 1's line 9, the first non-zero is block 1 (9,9), and there are no others. So the entire row after block 1 is filled with 9,9.\n\nIn Example 2's line 9 input: [0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0]. The first non-zero pair is at block 4 (2,2) and block 6 (2,2). The output is [0,0,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,0,0]. So between blocks 4 and 6, the blocks are filled with 2,2. But the earlier blocks (1-3) are filled with 3,3. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is applied to each row, and for each block in the row, if there's a non-zero pair in that block, then the same pair is placed in all other blocks of the same row. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each non-zero pair in a row is copied to all blocks that are in the same position relative to the separator as in other rows. But that's too vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the grid as a 2D array where each row has blocks separated by a certain number (8, 1, 4, etc.), which acts as a vertical separator. The non-zero pairs in the rows are being horizontally propagated to adjacent blocks in the same row.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's line 3, the 2,2 pairs in the input are spread to the adjacent blocks, replacing the zeros with 2,2. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that whenever there's a non-zero pair in a block, the same pair is placed in the adjacent blocks to the left and right, replacing any zeros. But this requires checking.\n\nIn Example 0's line 3, the input has 2,2 in block 1 and block 4. The output has 2,2 in blocks 1,2,3,4. So it's filling the space between them.\n\nPerhaps the non-zero pairs are connected, and the area between them is filled with the same value. Like, if there are two 2,2 pairs in a row, everything between them becomes 2,2. If there's a single pair, everything after it becomes that pair.\n\nSo the rule would be: For each row, if there are multiple non-zero pairs, fill the blocks between the first and last occurrence with the first pair's value. If there's only one non-zero pair, fill all blocks after it with that value.\n\nThis would explain Example 0's line 3: two 2,2 pairs, fill between them. Example 1's line 9: one 9,9 pair, fill all blocks after. Example 2's line 9: two 2,2 pairs, fill between them, but in the output, there's also 3,3 from earlier blocks, which may come from previous lines.\n\nWait, but Example 2's line 9 input has 2,2 in blocks 4 and 6. The output line 9 has 2,2 in blocks 4-6. But the output also has 3,3 in blocks 1-2. So where does that come from? This suggests that the transformation is not limited to the same row but involves vertical propagation.\n\nThis complicates things, as the transformation might involve both horizontal and vertical elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each block in a row, if there's a non-zero pair in the same column in the row above, then that pair is copied into this block. But how to check that.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's line 3, there's a 2,2 in block 1. The line above (line 2) is a separator. Line 4 is a duplicate of line 3. So maybe the transformation is applied to pairs of lines.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the examples have repeated lines (like in Example 0, lines 0 and 1 are the same, lines 3 and 4 are the same, etc.), maybe the transformation is applied to pairs of lines, and the output is a modified version where certain blocks are filled based on their adjacent lines.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nLet me look at the test input to see what needs to be transformed.\n\nThe test input's third and fourth lines (assuming lines start at 0) are:\n\n[0,0,4,0,0,4,8,8,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0]\n\n[0,0,4,0,0,4,8,8,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0]\n\nThe output for these lines should, according to the pattern observed in training examples, have the non-zero pairs spread. The 8,8 pair is in the third block (after the first two 4s). The 2,2 is in the sixth block (after the fourth 4). So according to the earlier hypothesis, between the first non-zero pair (8,8) and the last (2,2), the blocks should be filled with 8,8. But wait, the 8,8 is in a block, and the 2,2 is later. But the separator is 4. So the blocks between the first 8,8 and the 2,2 would be filled with 8,8? Or with the first non-zero pair in the row, which is 8,8.\n\nBut according to the training examples, when there are multiple non-zero pairs, the area between them is filled with the first pair. So in the test input's third line, the first non-zero pair is 8,8 in block 2 (assuming blocks are separated by 4s). The last non-zero pair is 2,2 in block 6. So the blocks between them (blocks 3,4,5) would be filled with 8,8. But the output would thus have 8,8 in those blocks.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's line 3, which has a 2,2 and a 4,4 in the same row. The output line 3 in Example 1's output has the 2,2 pair, and the 4,4 pair is replaced by 2,2. So the first non-zero pair is 2,2, and the 4,4 is replaced by 2,2. But in Example 1's line 3 input, the output line 3 is:\n\n[0,0,1,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,4,4,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nOutput line 3 is:\n\n[0,0,1,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,4,4,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nWait, no. Looking at the actual example, in Example 1's output, line 3 is:\n\n[0,0,1,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,4,4,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nWhich is the same as the input. So that contradicts the earlier hypothesis.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not straightforward. Maybe the key is to look for the first occurrence of a non-zero pair in a row and then replicate it to the right, replacing any zeros but leaving other non-zero pairs as they are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any non-zero pair in a row is replicated to the left and right until the next non-zero pair or the edge of the row.\n\nBut this needs to be consistent across examples.\n\nIn Example 0's line 3, the 2,2 pairs are replicated between themselves. So the area between the two 2,2 pairs is filled with 2,2.\n\nIn Example 1's line 9, the 9,9 pair is replicated to the right until the end of the row.\n\nIn Example 2's line 9, the 2,2 pairs are replicated between themselves, but there's also a 3,3 earlier in the row. So this is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the correct pattern is that for each row, any non-zero pair is duplicated to fill all blocks to the right, overwriting any zeros but leaving existing non-zero pairs as they are. So the first non-zero pair determines the value for all subsequent blocks until the end of the row.\n\nBut in Example 0's line 3, there are two 2,2 pairs. If the first 2,2 is copied to the right, the second 2,2 is left as is. So the output would have 2,2 after the first occurrence until the end, but the last block is 0,0. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the first non-zero pair is used to fill all blocks to the right, but any subsequent non-zero pairs stop the propagation. But in Example 0's line 3, the second 2,2 would stop the propagation. But the output shows that the blocks after the first 2,2 are filled with 2,2 up to the second 2,2, and then the blocks after the second 2,2 are left as is. So this suggests that the propagation stops at the next non-zero pair.\n\nThus, the rule could be: For each row, starting from the first non-zero pair, fill all subsequent blocks with that pair until the next non-zero pair is encountered. Then, after that non-zero pair, fill with its value until the next, and so on. But this would require that each non-zero pair affects the blocks after it until the next pair.\n\nBut in Example 0's line 3, the first pair is 2,2. Fill all blocks after until the next non-zero pair (another 2,2). So the blocks between the first and second 2,2 are filled with 2,2. The second 2,2 is left as is, and the blocks after it are filled with 2,2 until the end. But in the output, the last blocks after the second 2,2 are 0,0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the answer is to look at the test input and see what needs to be done.\n\nIn the test input, the third line is:\n\n[0,0,4,0,0,4,8,8,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0]\n\nSeparated by 4s, the blocks are:\n\nBlock 0: [0,0]\n\nBlock 1: [0,0]\n\nBlock 2: [8,8]\n\nBlock 3: [0,0]\n\nBlock 4: [0,0]\n\nBlock 5: [2,2]\n\nBlock 6: [0,0]\n\nBlock 7: [0,0]\n\nThe non-zero pairs are block 2 (8,8) and block 5 (2,2).\n\nFollowing the pattern from training examples, perhaps between these two pairs, the blocks are filled with the first pair's value (8,8). So blocks 3,4 between block 2 and 5 would become 8,8. Block 5 remains 2,2. Then, after block 5, the blocks are filled with 2,2.\n\nBut in the output, we need to see how this would look.\n\nAlternatively, the first non-zero pair in the row is 8,8 (block 2), and the next non-zero pair is 2,2 (block 5). So the blocks between them (3,4) would be filled with 8,8. Then, after block 5, the blocks are filled with 2,2.\n\nSo the output for this line would be:\n\n[0,0,4,0,0,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,0,0]\n\nBut the last blocks after 2,2 (block 6 and 7) would be filled with 2,2. But the original input has those blocks as [0,0] and [0,0], so they become [2,2] and [2,2].\n\nBut looking at the test input's third line, after the 2,2 block, there are more blocks. So applying this rule, the output would have:\n\nBlocks 0:0,0; 1:0,0; 2:8,8; 3:8,8; 4:8,8; 5:2,2; 6:2,2; 7:2,2.\n\nBut the test input's third line has:\n\n[0,0,4,0,0,4,8,8,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,2,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0]\n\nSo after block 5 (2,2), there are more blocks: block 6 is [0,0], block 7 is [0,0], etc. But according to the rule, after the 2,2, all subsequent blocks would become 2,2. So block 6 and 7 would become 2,2.\n\nBut the final block (after the last 4) is [0,0], which would remain as is.\n\nSo the output line would be:\n\n[0,0,4,0,0,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,0,0]\n\nBut this is just a guess. Also, in the test input, there's another line later with 3,3 in block 10.\n\nFor example, the tenth line of the test input is:\n\n[0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0]\n\nSo the non-zero pair here is 3,3 in block 10 (assuming blocks are numbered starting after each 4). According to the rule, all blocks after block 10 would be filled with 3,3. So the output for this line would have blocks 10:3,3, and blocks 11,12 (if any) filled with 3,3.\n\nBut considering the entire test input, the transformation would need to be applied to each row based on the non-zero pairs in that row.\n\nOverall, the pattern seems to be that in each non-separator row, the first non-zero pair encountered in the row is used to fill all subsequent blocks until the end of the row. Any existing non-zero pairs in the row are replaced with the first pair's value. But this doesn't fit all examples. However, given the time constraints and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and apply it to the test input.",
