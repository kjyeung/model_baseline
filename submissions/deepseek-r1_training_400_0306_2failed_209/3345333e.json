        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is to transform the input grid into the output grid based on some pattern observed in the training examples. Let's start by carefully examining the training examples to see what's going on.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. The input has a lot of 6s and 1s in certain rows, and the output seems to replace some of those 1s with 6s. For instance, in the fourth row of the input, there's a sequence of 1s that becomes 6s in the output. Similarly, other rows with 1s are transformed into 6s, but maybe there's a specific condition for when that happens.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 1s are adjacent to 6s. For example, the row [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...] becomes [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, ...] in the output. So the 1s that are next to 6s are turned into 6s. But how exactly? Maybe any 1 that is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a 6 gets replaced by 6. But let me check another part.\n\nIn the fifth row of the input, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0...] becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0...]. So here, the 1s following the 6 are turned into 6s, but the ones after that become zeros. Wait, that's not exactly adjacent. Maybe the rule is that 1s that are part of a contiguous block adjacent to a 6 are converted. Or perhaps it's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the maximum value in some neighborhood. Let's think: for each cell, if there's a higher number adjacent to it, then it's replaced by that higher number. For example, 1s next to 6s become 6s. Similarly, in Example 1, the input has 3s and 2s. In the output, some 3s are replaced by 2s. Wait, in Example 1's input, the fourth row has 3s and 2s. The output for that row becomes [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, ...], which suggests that the 3s are replaced by 2s. But why would that happen? 3 is higher than 2. So the previous idea about maximum might not hold.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers with other numbers based on their position relative to other numbers. Let's look again. In Example 0, the 1s are being replaced by 6s where they are adjacent. So perhaps any cell with a 1 that is adjacent (in any direction) to a 6 is turned into a 6, and other 1s remain? But in the input of Example 0, there's a row with 1s that are next to 6s, and in the output, those 1s become 6s. But other 1s in other rows? Wait, in the input of Example 0, all the 1s are adjacent to 6s. So maybe the rule is that all 1s are replaced by the highest neighboring value. But then in Example 1, in the input there's a row with 3s and 2s. The output for that row replaces the 3s with 2s. But 3 is higher than 2. That contradicts the previous idea.\n\nHmm. Let's take Example 1. The input's fourth row is [3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,0...], and the output for that row is [0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,0...]. So the 3s are replaced by 2s. How could that happen? Maybe the rule is that cells are replaced by the most common neighboring value. But 3s are surrounded by other 3s and 2s. Alternatively, maybe it's a different rule. Looking at the output for Example 1, the 3s in the input are replaced with 2s, which are adjacent. But why? Let's check the surrounding cells. The 3s in row 4 are next to 2s in their row. Maybe the transformation is that any cell with a number that is not the same as its left neighbor (or some direction) is replaced. Or perhaps the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others in a specific way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is creating a sort of outline or border around the regions of numbers. For example, in Example 0, the 1s form a block adjacent to 6s. The output replaces those 1s with 6s, effectively expanding the 6 regions. But why would that happen? Or perhaps the output is taking the input and merging adjacent regions of different numbers by replacing the lower number with the higher one if they are adjacent.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 1s are next to 6s, so they become 6s. In Example 1, the 3s are adjacent to 2s, so maybe they become 2s. But that would imply that lower numbers replace higher ones, which doesn't make sense. So that can't be the rule. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by the minimum adjacent number. But in Example 0, the 1s are next to 6s (higher) and become 6s, which is the maximum. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace any cell that is part of a group (contiguous same numbers) that is adjacent to a higher number group. So, for example, in Example 0, the group of 1s is adjacent to 6s. Since 6 is higher than 1, the entire 1 group is replaced by 6. Similarly, in Example 1, the group of 3s is adjacent to 2s. But 3 is higher than 2, so why are the 3s replaced by 2s? That doesn't fit. Unless the rule is the opposite: lower numbers replace higher ones when adjacent. But that seems unlikely. \n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the 3s are in rows 4,5,6,7. The output replaces those 3s with 2s. Let me check the surrounding cells. The 3s in row 4 are next to 2s (same row, columns 4-7). Maybe the 3s are being replaced by the adjacent 2s. But why? Perhaps the transformation is to replace all cells that are adjacent (even diagonally?) to a certain number with that number. For example, in Example 0, 1s adjacent to 6s become 6s. In Example 1, 3s adjacent to 2s become 2s. That would mean that any cell is replaced by the value of an adjacent cell, but only if that adjacent cell has a certain value. But how do we determine which value to take?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each cell with the maximum value in its 3x3 neighborhood (including itself). Let's test that. For Example 0, in the input row 3, the 1s are next to 6s. So their neighborhood includes 6s, so they become 6. For the 6s, since their max is 6, they stay. In Example 1's row 4, the 3s are next to 2s, but 3 is higher than 2. So their max would be 3. But in the output, those 3s are replaced by 2s. So that contradicts. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions where changes occur. In Example 0, the input has 1s in rows 3,4,5. The output changes those to 6s and 0s. Wait, in row 3 of the input: [0,0,0,6,6,0,1,1,1,1,0...] becomes [0,0,0,6,6,0,0,6,6,0,0...]. So the 1s are replaced by 6s starting from the third column. But how? The 1s are adjacent to the 6 in column 6. Wait, the 6s are in columns 3 and 4 (row 3). Then there's a 0 in column 5, then the 1s start at column 6. So maybe the 1s are adjacent to the 6s via some diagonal. Alternatively, maybe the 1s are connected to the 6s through other 1s. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to expand the regions of higher numbers into adjacent lower numbers. For example, 6s in the input expand into adjacent 1s. But in Example 1, 3s are higher than 2s, but in the output, 3s are replaced by 2s. That would contradict that idea. So that can't be.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the 3s in the input are replaced with 2s. So maybe the 3s are adjacent to 2s and the 2s are expanding into the 3s. But that would require the lower number to expand into higher, which doesn't make sense. So maybe the rule is different. Let's think of another possibility.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output again. The input's row 4 is [3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,0...], which becomes [0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,0...]. So the first four 3s are replaced with 0,0,2,2. That's a bit confusing. The 3s in columns 0-3 are replaced by 0,0,2,2. How does that happen? Maybe the 2s to the right (columns 4-7) are influencing this. Perhaps there's a directionality here. For example, the rightmost 3s (columns 2 and 3) are adjacent to the 2s in column 4, so they become 2s, while the 3s in columns 0 and 1 are not adjacent to any 2s and thus become 0. But why would they become 0? The original 3s are not adjacent to 0s. Alternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all cells except those that form a certain structure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is creating an outline around the regions. For example, in Example 0, the 6 regions are expanded. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to replace all cells that are not part of a 2x2 block. Let's see. In Example 0's input, the 1s are in a horizontal line of four. The output turns them into two 6s and two 0s, perhaps forming a 2x2 block. Wait, in the output of Example 0's row 3: [0,0,0,6,6,0,0,6,6,0...], which is two 6s, then two 6s later. Maybe the transformation is to form 2x2 blocks where possible. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the result of a cellular automaton step. For example, a rule where a cell becomes a certain value based on its neighbors. But without knowing the exact rule, this is hard.\n\nAnother angle: Let's compare the input and output grids for each example. For Example 0, the output seems to have replaced the 1s with 6s where they are adjacent. For instance, in row 3 of input, the 1s are adjacent to 6s (maybe diagonally?), and in the output, they are replaced by 6s. Similarly, in row 4 of the input, the 1s are adjacent to 6s and become 6s. But in the output, the 6s form a kind of diamond shape. Maybe the transformation is to create a symmetric structure. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the output of Example 0, the 6s form more symmetrical patterns. The input has some scattered 6s and 1s, and the output's 6s are arranged more neatly. Maybe the transformation is to smooth or fill in the shape of the regions. For example, filling in gaps to make the regions more solid. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of rotating the input grid. But looking at the positions, that doesn't seem to be the case. For example, in Example 0's input row 3, the 6s are in positions 3-4. The output's row 3 has 6s in the same positions, but the 1s are replaced by 6s further right. So rotation doesn't explain it.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for each cell in the output and see what it corresponds to in the input. For Example 0's row 3, column 6 in input is 1. In output, it's 0. Wait, but in the input row 3, columns 6-9 are 1s. In the output, columns 6-9 are 0,6,6,0. So maybe there's a replacement of the 1s based on their position relative to the 6s. For example, the first two 1s (columns 6-7) become 0 and 6. That's a bit random. Alternatively, perhaps the transformation is to shift the 1s into a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a mirror image. For example, flipping the input horizontally or vertically. But looking at the positions, that doesn't seem to fit. The 6s in the input of Example 0 are in columns 3-4, and in the output, they remain there, so flipping isn't the case.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is to replace all cells of a certain number with another number. In Example 0, replace 1 with 6. But in Example 1, replace 3 with 2. But how do we know which numbers to replace? Maybe the rule is that the largest number in the grid is replaced by the next largest, but that doesn't fit. In Example 0, 6 is the largest and stays. In Example 1, the largest is 3, which is replaced by 2. That would suggest a pattern of replacing the largest number with the next, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers in the output are the sum of neighboring cells modulo something. But that's unclear.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the test input. The test input has numbers 5 and 8. So applying the pattern to this. Let's see. The input has rows with 5s and 8s. For example, in row 6, columns 4-7 are 8s, then columns 8-11 are 5s. The output, following the pattern from the examples, might replace some of the 5s with 8s or vice versa, depending on adjacency.\n\nIn the training examples, when a lower number is adjacent to a higher one, the lower number is replaced. Wait, in Example 0, 1s (lower) adjacent to 6s (higher) are replaced by 6s. In Example 1, 3s (higher) adjacent to 2s (lower) are replaced by 2s. That's conflicting. So that's not a consistent rule. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace any cell that has a neighbor with a different number. So each cell becomes the majority of its neighbors, or the most common neighbor. For Example 0, the 1s are surrounded by 6s, so they become 6s. For Example 1, the 3s are surrounded by other 3s and 2s. If the majority are 3s, why replace them with 2s? This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to make the numbers form a checkerboard pattern or some other regular pattern. But the examples don't show that.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input's row 4 has 3s and 2s. The output's row 4 is [0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,0...]. So the 3s are replaced by 0s and 2s. How? The first two 3s become 0s, and the next two become 2s. Maybe this is based on their position relative to the 2s. The first two 3s (columns 0-1) are not adjacent to 2s (since the 2s start at column 4), so they become 0. The next two 3s (columns 2-3) are adjacent to 2s in column 4, so they become 2. Then the rest of the row is 2s as in the input. That could be a possible rule: cells that are adjacent to a higher or specific number are replaced by that number, otherwise turned to 0. But why in Example 0, the 1s turn into 6s, and in Example 1, 3s turn into 2s. Maybe the rule is to replace each cell with the minimum adjacent value. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, a 1 next to 6 would take the minimum (1), but in the output, it's replaced by 6. So that's not it. Alternatively, maximum adjacent value. So in Example 0, 1 next to 6 would become 6. In Example 1, 3 next to 2 would become 3, but in the output, it's 2. Contradiction.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Maybe the transformation is to create a border around the regions. For example, in Example 0, the 6s are expanded into the 1s to form a thicker border. In Example 1, the 2s are expanded into the 3s. But why would that happen? Because maybe the 2s are considered the border, and the 3s are filled in. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of a flood fill operation. For instance, starting from certain cells and filling adjacent cells with the same number. But how that would apply here is unclear.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input row 4: [3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,0...]. The output is [0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,0...]. So the first four 3s become 0,0,2,2. So the first two 3s become 0, the next two become 2. What's the difference between them? The columns 0-1 are 3s that are not adjacent to any 2s (since the 2s start at column 4). But columns 2-3 of the input are 3s adjacent to 2s (column 4 is 2). So perhaps cells that are adjacent (left, right, up, down, diagonal) to a certain number are replaced by that number. So in Example 1, the 3s adjacent to 2s become 2s, and the 3s not adjacent to any 2s become 0s. But why 0? Maybe because they are not adjacent to any number other than 3 and 0. Wait, in the input row 4, columns 0-3 are 3s. To their left is column -1 (non-existent), so they have neighbors to the right (columns 4 is 2). So columns 2-3 of 3s are adjacent to 2s, so they become 2s. Columns 0-1 of 3s are adjacent to other 3s (columns 1-2) and possibly 0s in row above or below. Wait, but in Example 1's input, row 3 has a 2 in column 3. So for row 4 column 0: maybe it's adjacent to row 3, column 0, which is 0. So the 3 in row 4 column 0 is adjacent to 0 above, and 3 to the right. So according to the possible rule, if any neighbor is a certain number, replace it. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be: for each cell, if it has any neighbor (including diagonally) with a different non-zero value, replace it with that value. If there are multiple different neighbors, maybe take the first or most common. But this is speculative.\n\nLet's try to formalize this possible rule. For each cell in the input grid, if the cell is non-zero and has at least one neighboring cell (in 8 directions) with a different non-zero value, then replace the cell's value with the value of one of those neighboring cells. If there are multiple different values, perhaps pick the smallest or largest.\n\nIn Example 0, the 1s are adjacent to 6s. So they become 6s. In Example 1, the 3s are adjacent to 2s. So they become 2s. The 3s that are not adjacent to any non-3 values (like row 4 columns 0-1) are adjacent to 0s (from the row above), which are zero. So according to the rule, since they have a zero neighbor, but the rule says to replace only if the neighbor is a different non-zero. So those 3s (columns 0-1) have no non-zero different neighbors, so they should stay 3. But in the output, they become 0. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any cell adjacent (including diagonally) to a zero is replaced by zero unless it has another neighbor with a higher number. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me try to think of another approach. Looking at the outputs, perhaps the transformation is to remove certain layers or to erode/dilate certain regions. For example, in Example 0, the 1s are eroded and replaced by 6s. In Example 1, the 3s are eroded and replaced by 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of replacing each number with the next higher number present in its Moore neighborhood (all eight surrounding cells). For Example 0, 1s have 6s in their neighborhood, so they become 6. For Example 1, 3s have 2s but no higher numbers. Wait, but 3 is higher than 2, so they would stay 3. But in the output, they become 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, replace each cell with the lowest number in its neighborhood. For Example 0, 1s have 6s, so they would become 1, which doesn't fit. For Example 1, 3s adjacent to 2s would become 2. That matches Example 1's output. But in Example 0, the 1s adjacent to 6s would become 1, which doesn't match. So conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is the opposite: replace each cell with the lowest number present in its neighborhood. For Example 0, the 1s are next to 6s and maybe 0s. The lowest would be 0. But the output replaces them with 6. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Let me try to look for another pattern. Both examples have the output grids with certain numbers replacing others in a way that seems to form more contiguous blocks. For instance, Example 0's output has more contiguous 6s, and Example 1's output has more contiguous 2s. Maybe the transformation is to replace all instances of a certain number that are adjacent to another number, with that other number. But how to decide which number to replace.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as edge detection. The output highlights the edges between different numbers. But the examples don't look like edge detection.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs have fewer non-zero numbers than the inputs. For example, in Example 0's input, there are 1s and 6s. The output has more 6s and fewer 1s. In Example 1's input, there are 3s and 2s. The output has more 2s and no 3s. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others, possibly merging regions.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers in the output are the result of XOR or some operation between adjacent cells. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a mirror image along a certain axis. For example, in Example 0's input row 3, the 1s are in columns 6-9. In the output, they're in columns 6-9 as 0,6,6,0. That doesn't look like a mirror.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace each cell with the count of its non-zero neighbors. But Example 0's output would then have numbers higher than 6, which they don't.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the input after applying a convolution kernel. For example, a kernel that detects edges or certain patterns. But without knowing the kernel, it's hard to tell.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to approach it step by step with the test input.\n\nThe test input has 5s and 8s. Looking at the structure:\n\nRows 6-10 have 8s in columns 4-7. The 8s are adjacent to 5s in some rows. For example, row 6: 8s followed by 5s. According to the possible pattern from the examples, maybe the 5s adjacent to 8s would be replaced by 8s, or vice versa. But in the training examples, sometimes higher numbers replace lower, sometimes lower replace higher. So this isn't clear.\n\nAlternatively, if the rule is to replace the number with the one that is most frequent in the neighborhood, but in Example 0, the 1s are replaced by 6s because they're adjacent. If the neighborhood includes 6s, then 6 becomes the majority. So for the test input, the 5s adjacent to 8s would become 8s, and 8s adjacent to 5s would become 5s. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut looking at the test input's row 6: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,0]. The 5s are adjacent to 8s. If following Example 0's pattern, the 5s next to 8s would become 8s. But in the output, maybe those 5s are replaced by 8s. Similarly, 8s adjacent to 5s might be replaced by 5s. But how to decide.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each cell with the maximum value in its neighborhood. For the test input's 5s next to 8s, they would become 8. The 8s next to 5s would stay 8, since 8 is larger. Then, the output would have expanded 8 regions into the 5 regions.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input's 3s adjacent to 2s would become 2s. But 3 is larger than 2. So this contradicts the maximum rule. Therefore, this can't be the case.\n\nAnother possibility: the transformation is to swap layers. For example, the top layer (highest number) is moved down, but this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of some kind of erosion or dilation in morphological image processing. For example, dilation with a certain kernel. But I need to think about how that applies.\n\nIn Example 0, the 6s are expanded into the 1s. So dilation of 6s with a 3x3 kernel. Similarly, in Example 1, the 2s are expanded into the 3s. So dilation of 2s. So the rule could be that each number is dilated, replacing adjacent cells with that number. But in that case, higher numbers would override lower ones when dilating. But in Example 1, the 2s dilate into the 3s, which are higher. That doesn't make sense unless the dilation is not based on value.\n\nAlternatively, the dilation is applied to all numbers, and in case of overlap, the highest number takes precedence. So for Example 0, the 6s dilate into the 1s, which are lower, so 6 takes over. For Example 1, the 2s dilate into the 3s, but since 3 is higher, the 3s would remain. But in Example 1's output, the 3s are replaced by 2s, which doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really perplexing. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 1s are surrounded by 6s. The output replaces those 1s with 6s. In Example 1's input, the 3s are surrounded by 2s and 0s. The output replaces 3s with 2s where adjacent to 2s and 0s otherwise.\n\nPerhaps the rule is: For each cell, if it is adjacent (including diagonally) to a cell with a different non-zero value, replace it with the smallest such value. If not adjacent to any non-zero values, replace with 0.\n\nLet's test this rule.\n\nExample 0:\n\nCell with 1 in row 3, column 6. Adjacent cells include 6 (row 3, column 3-4 are 6s? Wait, let's get the exact positions.\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 3 is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...]\n\nSo the 1s start at column 6. The 6s are in columns 3-4. So the 1s are two columns away from the 6s. So they're not directly adjacent. Wait, unless diagonally. For example, row 3, column 6 is adjacent to row 2, column 6, which is 0. Row 3, column 5 is 0. So how are the 1s adjacent to 6s?\n\nAh, maybe in the input of Example 0, the 1s are adjacent to 6s in the previous or next row. Let's look at row 4:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...]\n\nSo in row 4, columns 4-5 are 6s. So row 4, column 6 is 1, which is adjacent to row 4, column 5 (6). So in row 4, the 1s are adjacent to 6s. So in that case, the 1s in row 4 would be replaced by 6s, which matches the output.\n\nSimilarly, the 1s in row 3, column 6: adjacent cells include row 4, column 6 (1 in input). But how are they adjacent to 6s? Maybe in row 3, column 5 is 0, row 3 column 4 is 6. So the 1 in row 3, column 6 is adjacent to row 3, column 5 (0), row 4, column 5 (6). So diagonally adjacent to a 6. So according to the rule, if any neighbor has a different non-zero value, replace with the smallest such value. So the smallest non-zero neighbor here is 6, so replace 1 with 6. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 4, cell 0 is 3. Its neighbors: row 3, column 0 is 0 (from input), row 4, column 1 is 3, row 5, column 0 is 3 (from input row 5: [3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,0...]). So row 4, column 0's neighbors are 0 (above), 3 (right), 3 (below). So the only different non-zero neighbor is none. So according to the rule, replace with 0. Which matches the output. The cell row 4, column 2 (3) has neighbors: row 3, column 2 is 0, row 4, column 3 is 3, row 5, column 2 is 3. But also, row 4, column 4 is 2. So column 4 is 2. So the cell at row 4, column 2 is adjacent to column 4, row 4 (2). So different non-zero neighbor. The smallest such is 2. So replace 3 with 2. Which matches the output.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the rule would be:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid, look at all eight neighboring cells (including diagonally adjacent). If any of those neighbors have a different non-zero value, replace the cell's value with the smallest such value from the neighbors. If there are no such neighbors (i.e., all neighbors are either the same value or zero), then replace the cell's value with zero.\n\nLet's verify this with the examples.\n\nExample 0:\n\nCell in row 3, column 6 (value 1). Neighbors include row 4, column 5 (6). So the smallest non-zero neighbor value is 6. So cell becomes 6. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 1:\n\nCell in row 4, column 0 (value 3). Neighbors are 0 (from row 3, column 0), 3 (row 4, column 1), and 3 (row 5, column 0). All non-zero neighbors are 3 or 0. So no different non-zero neighbors. Thus, replace with 0. Which matches.\n\nCell in row 4, column 2 (value 3). Neighbors include row 4, column 4 (2). So the smallest different non-zero neighbor is 2. Replace 3 with 2. Correct.\n\nThis rule seems to fit both examples. Now, applying this rule to the test input.\n\nTest Input Analysis:\n\nLet's take the test input and apply this rule.\n\nTest Input row 6:\n\n[0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nFor each cell in this row, check neighbors.\n\nLet's look at the cell at row 6, column 8 (value 5). Neighbors include:\n\n- Left: column 7 (8)\n- Right: column 9 (5)\n- Above: row 5, column 8 (0)\n- Below: row 7, column 8 (0)\n- Diagonals: row 5, columns 7-9 (0, 5, 0), row 7, columns 7-9 (8,8,5), etc.\n\nWait, the exact neighbors would depend on the surrounding rows. Let me take a specific example.\n\nTake cell at row 6, column 8 (value 5). Its eight neighbors are:\n\n- row 5, column 7: 0 (from test input row 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0...], so column 7 is 5? Wait, row 5 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So column 7 is 5, column 11 is 5. So row 5, column 7 is 5.\n\nSo cell row 6, column 8's neighbors:\n\n- row 5, columns 7-9: 5 (column 7), 0 (column 8), 0 (column 9).\n- row 6, columns 7 and 9: 8 (column 7), 5 (column 9).\n- row 7, columns 7-9: 8 (row 7 has [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]).\n\nWait, row 7's columns 8-11 are 0,0,0,0.\n\nWait, this is getting complex. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFor each cell in the test input, we need to check all 8 neighbors and collect the non-zero values that are different from the cell's value.\n\nFor example, in row 6, column 8 (value 5):\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- Up: row 5, column 8 is 0.\n- Down: row 7, column 8 is 0.\n- Left: row 6, column 7 is 8.\n- Right: row 6, column 9 is 5.\n- Upper-left: row 5, column 7 is 5.\n- Upper-right: row 5, column 9 is 0.\n- Lower-left: row 7, column 7 is 8.\n- Lower-right: row 7, column 9 is 0.\n\nSo the neighbors with non-zero values different from 5 are 8 (from left and lower-left) and 5 (upper-left). Wait, the upper-left neighbor is row 5, column 7 which is 5. That's the same as the cell's value (5), so not different. The left neighbor is 8 (different), lower-left is 8 (different). So the different non-zero values are 8.\n\nSo the smallest such value is 8. So the cell at row 6, column 8 should become 8.\n\nSimilarly, the cell at row 6, column 9 (value 5) has neighbors:\n\n- Left: 5 (row 6, column 8)\n- Right: 0\n- Up: row 5, column 9 is 0\n- Down: row 7, column 9 is 0\n- Upper-left: row 5, column 8 is 0\n- Upper-right: row 5, column 10 is 0 (assuming row 5 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0...], column 10 is 0)\n- Lower-left: row 7, column 8 is 0\n- Lower-right: row 7, column 10 is 0 (row 7's columns 8-11 are 0,0,0,0)\n\nSo the only non-zero neighbor is left (5, same as cell value). So no different non-zero neighbors. So cell becomes 0.\n\nApplying this rule across all cells in the test input would generate the output.\n\nNow, let's attempt to apply this rule to the test input.\n\nTest Input row 6: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nProcessing each cell in row 6:\n\nColumn 4: 8\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- Up: row 5, column 4 is 0\n- Down: row 7, column 4 is 8\n- Left: row 6, column 3 is 0\n- Right: row 6, column 5 is 8\n- Upper-left: 0\n- Upper-right: row 5, column 5 is 0\n- Lower-left: row 7, column 3 is 0\n- Lower-right: row 7, column 5 is 8\n\nNon-zero different neighbors: None (all are 8 or 0). So cell remains 8.\n\nColumn 5: 8\n\nSimilar to column 4. All neighbors are 8 or 0. So remains 8.\n\nColumn 6:8.\n\nSame as above. Remains 8.\n\nColumn 7:8.\n\nNeighbors: \n\n- Right: row 6, column 8 is 5 (different non-zero). So different values:5.\n\nSo smallest different non-zero neighbor is 5. So cell becomes 5.\n\nWait, this is a change. In row 6, column 7, original value is 8. Has a neighbor to the right (column 8, 5). So the cell should be replaced with 5.\n\nBut according to the previous example, in Example 0, a 6 next to 1 would be replaced by the smallest different neighbor. But in Example 0, the 6s are not replaced, implying that if there are no different non-zero neighbors, the cell remains. But in this case, the cell is 8, has a neighbor with 5. So it should be replaced with 5.\n\nBut this would change the 8 in column 7 to 5. But in the output, what's expected? \n\nLooking at the training examples, when a higher number is adjacent to a lower, the higher number is replaced by the lower. For example, in Example 1, the 3s (higher) adjacent to 2s are replaced by 2s. So according to the rule, the cell would take the smallest different non-zero neighbor. So yes, 8 would become 5.\n\nBut let's continue.\n\nColumn 8:5.\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- Left:8 (different)\n- Others: as discussed earlier.\n\nSo different non-zero neighbors are 8. So smallest is 5? Wait, no. The different non-zero neighbors are 8. So the cell becomes 8.\n\nWait, the rule is to replace with the smallest different non-zero neighbor. So 8 is the only different non-zero neighbor, so cell becomes 8.\n\nSo column 8 becomes 8.\n\nColumn 9:5.\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- Left:5 (same)\n- Right:0\n- Others:0s or 5 (up and down). So no different non-zero neighbors. So cell becomes 0.\n\nColumn 10:5.\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- Left:5\n- Right:0\n- Up: row 5, column 10 is 0\n- Down: row 7, column 10 is 0\n- Diagonals: 0s and 5 (left). So no different non-zero neighbors. Becomes 0.\n\nColumn 11:0.\n\nNo change.\n\nColumn 12:5.\n\nNeighbors: Check if any non-zero different. For example, row 5, column 12 is 5 (from test input row 5, column 12 is 0?), wait test input row 5 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]. So column 11 is 5. So row 6, column 12 is 5. Let's see the neighbors:\n\n- Up: row 5, column 12 is 0\n- Down: row 7, column 12 is 5 (row 7: ...5,5,0,0)\n- Left: row 6, column 11 is 0\n- Right: row 6, column 13 is 0\n- Diagonals: row 5, column 11 is 5 (same), row 7, column 11 is 0. So different non-zero neighbors: row 7, column 12 is 5 (same). So no different non-zero. So cell becomes 0.\n\nSo after processing row 6, the row would become:\n\n[0,0,0,0,8,8,8,5,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, this is just a partial analysis. Applying this to the entire grid would take time, but following this rule, the output would have 8s replacing some 5s and 5s replacing some 8s where they are adjacent.\n\nBut the training examples show that when a cell has neighbors of lower numbers, it's replaced by the lowest. For example, in Example 1, 3s adjacent to 2s become 2s. Similarly, 8s adjacent to 5s would become 5s, and 5s adjacent to 8s would become 5s (since 5 is smaller than 8). Wait, according to the rule, the cell's value is replaced by the smallest different non-zero neighbor. So if a 5 is adjacent to an 8, the 8 is a different non-zero neighbor. The smallest such is 5? No, 5 is the cell's own value. Wait, the neighbor's value is 8. So the smallest different non-zero neighbor is 8, but 8 is larger than 5. But according to the rule, we take the smallest of the different non-zero neighbors. So if a cell is 5 and has a neighbor 8, the smallest different non-zero neighbor is 8. But 8 is larger than 5. But according to the rule, we would replace the cell with 8? That would contradict the previous examples.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The rule says: for each cell, collect all neighboring cells that are non-zero and have a different value. Then, replace the cell's value with the smallest value among those. If there are none, replace with 0.\n\nSo if a cell is 5 and has a neighbor that is 8, the different non-zero values are [8]. The smallest is 8. So the cell becomes 8.\n\nBut in Example 1, a cell with 3 and a neighbor with 2 would become 2 (smallest of [2]).\n\nIn Example 0, cell with 1 and neighbor 6 becomes 6.\n\nSo in the test input, a cell with 5 and neighbor 8 becomes 8. But a cell with 8 and neighbor 5 would have different non-zero neighbors [5], so it becomes 5.\n\nSo in row 6, column 7 is 8, adjacent to 5 in column 8. So cell becomes 5.\n\nColumn 8 is 5, adjacent to 8 in column 7. So cell becomes 8.\n\nThis creates a checkerboard pattern? For example, alternating 5 and 8 in adjacent cells.\n\nBut applying this to the entire grid would result in certain changes.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll proceed to generate the output based on this rule.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the output should have regions where 5s and 8s are replaced based on their neighbors.\n\nFor example, the 5s adjacent to 8s become 8s, and 8s adjacent to 5s become 5s. This might lead to a pattern where the borders between 5s and 8s become a checkerboard of 5 and 8.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Given the time, I'll proceed to generate the output for the test input based on this rule.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to find the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the training examples closely.\n\nIn Example 0, the input and output are both 16x16 grids. Comparing them, I notice that some of the numbers have changed. Let's look at specific rows. For instance, in row 3 of the input, the values are [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and in the output, it becomes [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So the 1s here are replaced with 6s. Similarly, in row 4 of the input, the 1s become 6s and the structure changes. Maybe there's a substitution happening where certain numbers are replaced with others based on their neighbors?\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has numbers like 3 and 2. In the output, the 3s are gone, replaced by 2s. For example, row 4 input starts with 3s and becomes 0s and 2s. So perhaps the rule is replacing numbers with adjacent numbers or their neighbors. Wait, maybe it's about the borders? Like, the non-zero numbers are being replaced to form a more contiguous shape. Like, maybe the transformation is taking the outline of a shape, replacing inner numbers with zeros or another number.\n\nAnother angle: in the first example, the input has 1s surrounded by 6s. The output replaces those 1s with 6s. So maybe any cell that's adjacent (including diagonally?) to a certain number is replaced by that number. Wait, in Example 0, the 1s are adjacent to 6s. So maybe the 1s are being replaced by the number that surrounds them. So if a cell is surrounded by a certain number, it changes to that number.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 1s in row 3 are next to 6 and 0. But in the output, they become 6. Maybe the 1s are being replaced by the dominant neighboring number. Alternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace a number with the most common neighbor. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each number is replaced by the number that is most prevalent in its Moore neighborhood (all 8 surrounding cells). For instance, in Example 0, the 1s are surrounded by 6s and 0s. If the majority are 6s, they become 6. But looking at the input row 3, the 1s are next to a 0 to the left and 6 above. Maybe it's more about the immediate neighbors. Or perhaps it's a cellular automaton rule where certain numbers spread to adjacent cells.\n\nWait, another possibility: the output is a kind of outline or border of the original shapes. For example, in Example 0, the input's 1s form a block that's replaced by 6s in the output, but maybe keeping the perimeter. Let's check: the original 1s in row 3 are four in a row. The output has two 6s followed by two 6s. So maybe the 1s are replaced by the surrounding 6s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing all instances of a certain number (like 1) with another number (like 6), as in Example 0. But in Example 1, the input has 3s which are replaced by 2s. So perhaps the rule is that the highest number in a contiguous region is replaced by the next lower number? Or maybe a certain number is replaced by another based on their position in the grid.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 1. The input has 3s in rows 4-7. The output replaces those 3s with 2s. So perhaps the transformation is replacing a higher number with a lower one. But in Example 0, 1 is replaced by 6, which is higher. So that might not fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced by the maximum value in its neighboring cells. Let's test this. For Example 0, the 1s in row 3 are surrounded by 6 above and 0 to the left. The maximum neighbor is 6, so replacing 1 with 6. That seems to fit. For the 6s, their neighbors are 0s and other 6s. If a 6's maximum neighbor is 6, then it stays the same. So that could explain why 6s remain. Similarly, in Example 1, the 3s are adjacent to 2s. The maximum neighbor of 3 would be 3 (if there are other 3s around), but in row 4 of the input, the 3s are adjacent to 3s and 2s. Wait, but the output changes the 3s to 2s. That contradicts the maximum neighbor idea. So maybe that's not the rule.\n\nAnother approach: looking for a kernel or convolution. For example, applying a filter where each cell becomes the sum or product of its neighbors. But I need to see if that applies to the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is flipping or rotating the grid. But looking at the first example, the input and output have similar structures but with some rows adjusted. For instance, in row 3 of the input, the 1s become 6s. So flipping isn't the case.\n\nWait, maybe it's about layers. The 1s in Example 0 are an inner layer of a 6 structure, and they get replaced by 6s to form a different shape. Like, expanding the 6 regions. Let's see. The input has a 6 structure with 1s inside, and the output replaces those 1s with 6s. Similarly, in Example 1, the 3s are replaced by 2s, which might be another layer. So maybe the pattern is that certain numbers are being replaced by the surrounding numbers to form a more connected structure.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be that any cell that is part of a group (contiguous cells of the same number) is replaced by the number that surrounds that group. For instance, if a group of 1s is entirely surrounded by 6s, the 1s become 6s. But how does that apply to Example 1, where 3s are replaced by 2s? If the 3s are surrounded by 2s, then that's the case. Let's check Example 1's input. The 3s in row 4 are adjacent to 2s. So if a group of 3s is surrounded by 2s, they become 2s. That might fit. Then the test input would require replacing certain numbers based on their surrounding numbers.\n\nLooking at the test input: There are 5s and 8s. Let's see where they are. For example, in row 6, there's an 8 surrounded by 8s and 5s. If the rule is that a cell is replaced by the surrounding number, then perhaps 5s that are adjacent to 8s become 8s, or vice versa. Alternatively, maybe the 5s inside 8 regions are replaced by 8s, and the 8s inside 5 regions become 5s. Let's see.\n\nIn the test input, rows 6-10 have 8s and 5s. For instance, in row 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]. If the 5s adjacent to 8s are replaced by 8s, or perhaps the 5s that are surrounded by 8s become 8s. Alternatively, maybe the 8s form a border, and the inner parts (5s) are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each number is replaced by the number that forms the majority in its immediate vicinity, but that might be complicated.\n\nAnother thought: in the training examples, the output seems to simplify the structure. In Example 0, the 1s are replaced by 6s, making the 6 structure more contiguous. Similarly, in Example 1, the 3s are replaced by 2s, making a more uniform 2 structure. So the pattern might be that certain numbers are replaced by others to form a more connected or solid shape. For example, numbers that are part of a larger structure are replaced by the dominant number around them.\n\nLooking at the test input, the 8s and 5s might be interacting. Perhaps the 5s that are within the 8 regions are replaced by 8s, and vice versa. For example, in row 6 of the test input, the 5s after the 8s could be replaced by 8s if they're adjacent. But let's look for where 5s are surrounded by 8s. For instance, in row 7, the input has [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0]. The 5s here are next to 8s and zeros. If the rule is to replace 5s that are adjacent to 8s with 8s, then those 5s would become 8s. But in the output of the training examples, the replaced numbers took on the surrounding number. So perhaps in the test input, any 5 that is adjacent (even diagonally) to an 8 would become an 8, and similarly, any 8 adjacent to a 5 becomes a 5? Or perhaps only the inner parts are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to take the outline of the shapes. For example, in Example 0, the 1s are inside the 6s, so replacing them with 6s to form a solid block. Similarly, in Example 1, the 3s are inside the 2s, so replaced by 2s. If that's the case, then in the test input, the 5s that are inside the 8s would become 8s, and the 8s inside 5s would become 5s. Let's check.\n\nLooking at the test input, rows 6-10 have a lot of 8s. The 5s are adjacent to 8s. For example, in row 6, the 5s come after the 8s. Maybe the 5s here are part of a separate structure. Alternatively, perhaps the 5s and 8s form overlapping regions. If the rule is to replace numbers that are enclosed by another number, then the inner numbers get replaced by the enclosing number. For instance, if a group of 5s is entirely surrounded by 8s, then those 5s become 8s. Similarly, if a group of 8s is surrounded by 5s, they become 5s.\n\nBut looking at the test input, there's a part in row 6 where after the 8s, there's 5,5,5,0,5. The 5s there are not entirely surrounded by 8s. However, in row 7, after the 8s, there are 0s and then 5,5. So maybe those 5s are not enclosed by 8s, so they remain. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all instances of a certain number with another based on some hierarchy. For example, in Example 0, 1s are replaced by 6s; in Example 1, 3s are replaced by 2s. Perhaps the rule is that lower numbers are replaced by higher adjacent numbers, but that doesn't fit because in Example 1, 3 is higher than 2, but 3s become 2s. So that's contradictory.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers represent layers, and the transformation is to take the topmost layer. For example, in Example 0, 6 is on top of 1, so 1s are replaced by 6. But in Example 1, 3 is replaced by 2, which might be the layer below. But this is vague.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the positions of the numbers. In Example 0, the 1s form a horizontal line in rows 3-5. The output replaces them with 6s, but arranged differently. Maybe it's a rotation or reflection. But the structure changes from a horizontal line to a different shape, which might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be a dilation or erosion of certain regions. For instance, expanding the 6 regions into the 1s. In Example 0, the 1s are replaced by 6s, which could be a dilation. Similarly, in Example 1, the 3s are eroded into 2s. But why would the dilation/erosion apply to different numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers represent different colors or layers, and the output is a combination where certain colors overlay others. For example, in Example 0, the 1s (perhaps a different color) are covered by the 6s, so they get replaced. But how to determine which color overlays which?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a common pattern between the two examples.\n\nIn both examples, the output seems to simplify the input by replacing certain numbers with their surrounding numbers. For example:\n\n- In Example 0, all 1s are replaced by 6s.\n- In Example 1, all 3s are replaced by 2s.\n\nIf that's the case, then the pattern is replacing specific numbers with another number. But how to determine which number to replace and with what?\n\nLooking at the input and output, in Example 0, the 1s are surrounded by 6s. So perhaps when a number is adjacent to another number, it gets replaced by that number. But how to determine which one.\n\nAlternatively, in Example 0, 1 is the only number other than 0 and 6. The output replaces 1 with 6. In Example 1, 3 and 2 are present. The output replaces 3 with 2. So maybe the rule is that the lower-numbered color replaces the higher-numbered one, or vice versa?\n\nWait, in Example 0, 1 is replaced by 6 (higher number). In Example 1, 3 is replaced by 2 (lower number). So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the majority in the entire grid. In Example 0, there are more 6s than 1s, so 1s become 6s. In Example 1, there are more 2s than 3s, so 3s become 2s. That could make sense. So the rule could be: replace all occurrences of a certain number (the minority) with the majority number. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, the input has a lot of 6s and some 1s. The majority is 6, so replace 1s with 6s. In Example 1, the input has 3s and 2s. The majority might be 2s, so 3s are replaced with 2s. That seems plausible. Let's verify.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 1s are in rows 3-5, a total of 12 cells. The 6s are much more. So majority is 6. So replace 1 with 6. In Example 1's input, the 3s are in rows 4-7, perhaps 12 cells, while the 2s are present in rows 4-10. The count of 2s is higher, so replace 3 with 2. That fits. \n\nSo the pattern might be: for all non-zero numbers in the input, find the number with the highest frequency (majority), and replace all other non-zero numbers with that majority number. But wait, in Example 0, the majority is 0, but 0 is not considered. So maybe the majority among non-zero numbers. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input non-zero numbers: 6s and 1s. Let's count:\n\nLooking at Example 0's input rows:\n\nRow 2: two 6s\nRow 3: two 6s, four 1s\nRow 4: two 6s, four 1s\nRow 5: one 6, four 1s\nRow 6: two 6s\nRow 7: four 6s\nRow 8: two 6s\nRow 9: four 6s\nRow 10: two 6s\n\nTotal 6s: 2+2+2+1+2+4+2+4+2 = Let's calculate step by step:\n\nRow 2: 2\nRow3: 2\nRow4: 2\nRow5: 1\nRow6: 2\nRow7:4\nRow8:2\nRow9:4\nRow10:2\nTotal 6s: 2+2=4 (rows2-3), +2+1=3 (rows4-5), +2+4=6 (rows6-7), +2+4=6 (rows8-9), +2 (row10) \u2192 4+3+6+6+2=21 6s.\n\nTotal 1s: in rows3-5: row3:4, row4:4, row5:4 \u2192 total 12. So 21 6s vs 12 1s. So majority is 6. So replace 1s with 6s. Which is what happened.\n\nIn Example1's input, non-zero numbers are 2,3. Let's count:\n\nRow3: two 2s\nRow4: four 3s, four 2s\nRow5: four 3s, five 2s\nRow6: four 3s, three 2s\nRow7: four 3s, one 2\nRow8: six 2s\nRow9: four 2s, two 2s (assuming row9's input is [0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, ...], so 2s count: 2,2,2,2 \u2192 4 (columns5-8) + 2 (columns10-11?), perhaps. Let me recount the input:\n\nExample1 input row4: [3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,0,0,...] \u2192 4 3s and 4 2s.\n\nRow5: [3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,0,...] \u2192 4 3s and 5 2s.\n\nRow6: [3,3,3,3,2,2,0,2,0,...] \u2192 4 3s and 3 2s.\n\nRow7: [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,2,0,...] \u21924 3s and 1 2.\n\nRow8: [0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,...] \u21926 2s.\n\nRow9: [0,2,2,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,...] \u21924 2s (columns2-3,5-6,8-9).\n\nRow10: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,...] \u21924 2s.\n\nSo total 3s: row4 (4) + row5 (4) + row6 (4) + row7 (4) \u2192 16 3s.\n\nTotal 2s: row3 (2) + row4 (4) + row5 (5) + row6 (3) + row7 (1) + row8 (6) + row9 (4) + row10 (4) \u2192 2+4=6, +5=11, +3=14, +1=15, +6=21, +4=25, +4=29. So 29 2s vs 16 3s. So majority is 2. So replace 3s with 2s, which is what happens in Example1's output.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: among all non-zero numbers in the input grid, determine which number is the most frequent (majority), and replace all other non-zero numbers with this majority number.\n\nTesting this hypothesis:\n\nIn the test input, the non-zero numbers are 5 and 8. Let's count them.\n\nTest input:\n\nRows 5: two 5s.\n\nRow6: four 8s, three 5s.\n\nRow7: four 8s, two 5s.\n\nRow8: four 8s, six 5s.\n\nRow9: four 8s, one 5.\n\nRow10: four 8s, six 5s.\n\nRow11: five 5s.\n\nRow12: one 5.\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0] \u2192 four 8s, two 5s.\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0] \u2192 four 8s, six 5s.\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 four 8s, one 5.\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0] \u2192 four 8s, six 5s.\n\nRow11: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0] \u2192 five 5s.\n\nRow12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0] \u2192 two 5s.\n\nSo let's count:\n\n8s: rows6-10 have 4 each in rows6,7,8,9,10 \u2192 4*5=20. Wait, row6 has 4 8s, row7:4, row8:4, row9:4, row10:4 \u2192 total 4*5=20 8s.\n\n5s:\n\nRow5: two.\n\nRow6: three.\n\nRow7: two.\n\nRow8: six.\n\nRow9: one.\n\nRow10: six.\n\nRow11: five.\n\nRow12: two.\n\nTotal: 2+3=5, +2=7, +6=13, +1=14, +6=20, +5=25, +2=27. So 27 5s and 20 8s. So majority is 5. So according to the pattern, replace all 8s with 5s.\n\nThus, in the test input's output, every 8 should become 5, and 5s remain. Let's verify this.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows:\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 after replacing 8s with 5s, becomes [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,0].\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0] \u2192 becomes [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0].\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0] \u2192 becomes [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0].\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 becomes [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0] \u2192 becomes [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0].\n\nOther rows with 5s remain the same except any 8s are replaced by 5s. So the output should have all 8s replaced by 5s, and 5s remain. Let's check if this makes sense.\n\nFor example, row5 in the test input is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Since there are no 8s here, it remains the same.\n\nRow6 after replacement would have four 5s where the 8s were, and the existing 5s stay. So the row becomes [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,0].\n\nSimilarly, row7 becomes all 5s in the 8 positions, and the existing 5s stay.\n\nSo applying this transformation to the entire test input would result in replacing every 8 with 5, and leaving 5s as they are.\n\nThus, the output should be the test input with all 8s changed to 5s.\n\nNow, let's apply this to each row of the test input:\n\nOriginal test input rows (numbered 0 to 15):\n\nRow 0-4: all zeros. No change.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0] \u2192 remains same.\n\nRow6: Original: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 replaced 8s with 5s \u2192 [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,0].\n\nRow7: Original: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0] \u2192 becomes [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0].\n\nRow8: Original: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0] \u2192 becomes [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0].\n\nRow9: Original: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 becomes [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow10: Original: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0] \u2192 becomes [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0].\n\nRow11: Original: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0] \u2192 no 8s, remains same.\n\nRow12: Original: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0] \u2192 same.\n\nRows 13-15: all zeros.\n\nSo the output would be all the test input's rows, but with every 8 replaced by 5. This should be the case.",
