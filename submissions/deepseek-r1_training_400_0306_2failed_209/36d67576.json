        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids based on the training examples provided. Then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by analyzing the training examples one by one to identify any common transformations.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. Let's compare the two. The input has several numbers: 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s. The output seems to add some numbers in certain positions. For instance, in the third row of the input, there's a row with [0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]. The output for that row becomes [0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,3,4,0,0]. So a 3 was added in the 9th position. Similarly, in the fourth row, the output has a 1 added in the 11th position. \n\nAnother thing I notice is that in the input, certain numbers like 4s form blocks. The output seems to add numbers (like 3, 1, 2) around those blocks. Maybe it's about the adjacency to certain numbers. Let me check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1's input, looking at the fifth row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0] becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,4,4,0]. So a 1 is added next to the 2. Wait, but the output row here has a 1 in the 8th position (assuming zero-based or one-based? Hmm, maybe indexes start at 0). Wait, let's see. The input fifth row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]. The output fifth row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,4,4,0]. So the 2 in the input's 9th index (if zero-based, that's position 9) is replaced with 4s, and a 1 is added before it. Maybe the 2 is part of a structure that's being modified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about adding certain numbers next to others. For example, whenever there's a 4, maybe a 3 is added nearby. Or when there's a 2, a 1 is added. Let's check more examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. In the input's sixth row, there's [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0], which becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,1,0,0]. So a 1 is added next to the 4s. Similarly, in the same example, the seventh row input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0], output is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0]. So a 3 is added next to the 4 here.\n\nPutting this together, maybe the pattern is that for each cell in the input, if there's a certain number (like 4, 3, 2), we add a specific number adjacent to it. For example, 4s might have 3s added next to them, 3s might have 1s, 2s might have 1s. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers form a hierarchy where lower numbers are placed adjacent to higher numbers. Like 4s spawn 3s, 3s spawn 1s, 2s spawn 1s. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, in the third row, there's a row of 4s. The output adds a 3 in a nearby position. In the same example's second row, there's a 2, and in the output, the next row (fourth row) adds a 1 next to the 2. Wait, the input row has a 2 in position 5 (zero-based?), and the output's fourth row has a 1 in position 11. Not sure if that's adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being added in specific directions relative to the original numbers. For instance, 4s might have a 3 added below them, or to the right, or something like that.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input row 2 (third row) with 4s: [0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]. The output for that row is [0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,3,4,0,0]. So a 3 is added in the 9th position (zero-based index 9). Looking at the original row, the 4s end at index 5 (0-based) and then there's a 4 at index 10. The 3 is placed at index 9. So maybe adjacent to the 4 in position 10. The 3 is to the left of that 4. But then in the fourth row of input, there's a 3 in index 1. The output adds a 1 in index 11. Maybe the 3's are spawning 1s in a certain direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number X (excluding 0) in the input is causing a number X-1 to be placed in a specific adjacent cell. For example, a 4 would place a 3, a 3 places a 2 (but in the examples, maybe 3s place 1s?), but that might not align. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the third row has 4s, and the output adds a 3. So 4 \u2192 3. Then in the fourth row, the input has 3s, and the output adds a 1 (row 3, index 11). So 3 \u21921? That doesn't follow X-1. But maybe the next lower number, but with some exception. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a matter of each non-zero number creating a lower number in a certain direction. For example, each 4 adds a 3 to the left, each 3 adds a 1 below, and each 2 adds a 1 to the right. But this needs to be checked against the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0 again. The input row 2 (third row) has 4s. The output adds a 3 in the same row, but to the left of the 4 in index 10. So maybe each 4 adds a 3 to the left. Let's see:\n\nIn the third row of input, there's a 4 at index 10. The output row has a 3 at index 9. So left of the 4. Then, in the fourth row of input, there are 3s. For example, index 1 is a 3. The output in the fourth row has a 1 at index 11. That's not adjacent. Wait, maybe the direction depends on the number. Let me check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the fifth row has a 2 at index 9. The output adds a 1 at index 8. So to the left. Then in the seventh row of input, there's a 4 in index 9. The output adds a 3 at index 8 (left?) and 3s at 10 and 11. Wait, maybe when there's a 4, a 3 is added to the left, but that's not consistent. Alternatively, maybe the direction is based on some other factor.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers could be flowing in a certain direction. For example, 4s are solid blocks, and adjacent cells get lower numbers based on some flow. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output grids cell by cell to see what changes. For each cell in the output that is non-zero where the input was zero, check the surrounding cells in the input to see if there's a pattern.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's output, the cell at row 3, column 9 (assuming rows start at 0) is 3. In the input, that cell was 0. Looking at the input's neighbors of that cell:\n\nIn row 3, column 9, input is 0. Let's check adjacent cells. The cells above (row 2, column 9) in input is 0. To the left (column 8) in row 3 is 0. To the right (column 10) in row 3 is 0. Below (row 4, column 9) is 0. Wait, but in the input, row 3 has 3s in columns 1,3,5. How does the 3 get added in column 9? Maybe this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being added based on some other structure. Let's look at Example 0's input and output.\n\nAnother observation: The output seems to have some kind of diagonal or adjacent patterns. For instance, in Example 0's output, the fourth row (index 3) has a 3 at column 1, and in the output, there's a 1 at column 11. That's far apart. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe each number in the input creates a lower number in a specific direction. For example:\n\n- A 4 in the input adds a 3 to the left.\n- A 3 adds a 1 below.\n- A 2 adds a 1 to the right.\n- A 1 doesn't add anything (since there's no 0 in the numbering here).\n\nLooking at Example 0's input third row (row 2), the 4 at column 10 in the input. The output row 2 adds a 3 at column 9 (left). Then, in row 3 of input, there's a 3 at column 5. The output adds a 1 at column 11. Wait, that's not below. So perhaps this isn't the right pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction depends on the position in a sequence. For example, numbers are placed in a clockwise or counter-clockwise manner around the original number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are part of a chain: 4 \u21923 \u21921, and 2 \u21921. So each 4 generates a 3 in some direction, each 3 generates a 1, and each 2 generates a 1. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the row with 4s (row 2) generates a 3 to the left. Then those 3s (if any) would generate 1s. But in row 3 of input, the 3s are already present, and the output adds 1s in some positions. For example, in row 3, column 11 of the output, there's a 1. The input row 3 has a 3 at column 1, 3, 5. How does that lead to a 1 at column 11? Maybe the 3s generate 1s to the right? Or perhaps the direction is based on the position relative to other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each non-zero number in the input creates a new number (value-1) in a specific direction relative to their original position. For example:\n\n- 4s create a 3 to the left.\n- 3s create a 2 below.\n- 2s create a 1 to the right.\n\nBut in the examples, it's not clear. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 2 (third row), the 4 at column 10 (assuming columns are 0-based). If 4 creates a 3 to the left (column 9), then that's correct as in the output. Then, the new 3 in column 9 would create a 2 below, which would be in row 3, column 9. But looking at the input row 3, column 9 is 0. In the output, row 3, column 9 is 0, but row 3, column 11 has a 1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps the chain is shorter. Like 4 \u21923, and 3 \u21921, skipping 2.\n\nBut then, if 3s create 1s, where would they be placed? In Example 0's input, row 3 has 3s at columns 1,3,5. The output has a 1 in column 11 of row 3. That's far away. So maybe this isn't the pattern.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the positions where new numbers are added. Let's take Example 0's output and see where new numbers are added:\n\nIn row 2, column 9: 3 added. Input here was 0. The original row 2 has 4s in columns 1-5 and 10. So maybe the new 3 is adjacent to the 4 at column 10. Column 9 is left of column 10. So 3 added to the left of 4.\n\nIn row 3, column 11: 1 added. The original row 3 has 3s at columns 1,3,5. The new 1 is at column 11. How is that related? Not sure. Maybe it's to the right of a 2. Looking at row 1, column 5 is a 2. Maybe the 2 in row 1, column 5 generates a 1 to the right in row 3. But that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number generates a new number in a specific direction. For example, 4s generate 3s to the left, 3s generate 1s to the right, 2s generate 1s below. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input row 2, column 10 is 4. Output adds 3 to the left (column 9) \u2014 fits. Then, in row 3, columns 1,3,5 are 3s. If each 3 generates a 1 to the right, then columns 2,4,6 would get 1s. But in the output row 3, column 11 gets a 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new numbers are placed in a diagonal direction. For example, a 4 in (row, col) generates a 3 at (row+1, col-1), or something like that. Let's test:\n\nExample 0's input row 2, column 10 is 4. Output adds 3 at row 2, column 9. So same row, left column. Not diagonal. Then, input row 3, column 5 is 3. Output row 3, column 11 is 1. The difference is columns 5 to 11 is +6, same row. So that's not a diagonal. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is adding numbers in positions that form a mirror image or some symmetry. But looking at the examples, it's not clear.\n\nLet me think of Example 1. In the input's fifth row, there's a 2 at column 9. The output adds a 1 at column 8 (left). So 2 \u21921 to the left. Then, in the seventh row of the input, there's a 4 at column 9. The output adds 3s at columns 8, 10, 11. So maybe 4s generate 3s in multiple directions. For example, left, right, and down?\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a number is surrounded by certain other numbers, a new number is added. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 4 and is 0, it becomes a 3. But looking at Example 0's input row 2, column 9 is 0 and adjacent to column 10's 4. So it becomes 3. That fits. Then, in row 3, column 11: what's adjacent there? Let's see. Input row 3, column 11 is 0. Adjacent cells would be row 2, column 11 (0), row 4, column 11 (0), left and right. But in the input, row 3, column 10 is 4. So column 11 is to the right of column 10's 4. But the output has a 1 here, not a 3. So that contradicts the previous idea.\n\nWait, perhaps the rules vary depending on the number. For example:\n\n- For each 4 in the input, place a 3 to the left (if that cell is 0).\n- For each 3 in the input, place a 1 to the right (if 0).\n- For each 2 in the input, place a 1 below (if 0).\n\nLet's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow 2, column 10 is 4. To the left is column 9. In the output, column 9 is 3. That fits.\n\nRow 1, column 5 is 2. Below that is row 2, column 5 (which is 4 in input). Not a 0. So perhaps no placement. But in the output, row 3, column 5 is 3 (input) and output adds 1 in row 3, column 11. Not sure.\n\nAnother example: Example 1's input, row 4 has a 2 at column 9. Below that is row 5, column 9. In the output, row 5, column 8 is 1. Wait, that's to the left. So maybe the 2 generates a 1 to the left. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number X generates a (X-1) in a certain direction, but the direction depends on X. For example:\n\n- 4s generate 3s to the left.\n- 3s generate 2s to the right.\n- 2s generate 1s below.\n\nBut then, 3s would generate 2s, which in turn generate 1s. But in Example 0's output, after a 3 is placed, there's a 1, not a 2. So maybe it's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation might be that each number X in the input adds a number (X-1) in the cell that is one step clockwise around it. For example, for a 4, look in the next direction clockwise (right, down, left, up). So perhaps 4's next is to the left. Then 3's next direction is down. 2's next is right. 1's next is up.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's see:\n\nFor a 4, clockwise direction. Let's say the order is right, down, left, up. So for 4, the next direction after up is right. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, each number X has a direction associated with it. Like 4 is left, 3 is down, 2 is right, 1 is up. Then, when you have a number X, you place X-1 in the direction associated with X.\n\nFor example, 4 \u2192 left, so place 3 to the left. 3 \u2192 down, so place 2 below. 2 \u2192 right, so place 1 to the right. 1 \u2192 up, so nothing (since 0 is the base). Let's test this:\n\nExample 0's input row 2, column 10 is 4. Place 3 to the left (column 9). That fits.\n\nInput row 1, column 5 is 2. Place 1 to the right (column 6). But in the output, row 1, column 5 is still 2, and column 6 is 0. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input row 1, column 5 is 2. The output row 1 is the same. But in row 3, column 11, there's a 1. How is that connected? Maybe the 2 in row 1, column 5 leads to a 1 in row 3, column 11. That doesn't fit the direction idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a cascading effect where each number generates a lower number in a certain direction, and that lower number generates another, etc. But given the examples, it's not clear.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the outputs, the numbers added are often 3, 1, 2. Maybe they are placed in a way that forms a path or connects different numbers. For example, 4s are connected via 3s, which are connected via 1s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero number in the input is part of a shape, and the output adds certain numbers around those shapes. For example, 4s form a horizontal line, and 3s are added to the left end. Then, 3s form a vertical line, and 1s are added at the bottom. Let's check Example 0.\n\nIn the input, row 2 has a horizontal line of 4s (columns 1-5 and 10). The output adds a 3 at column 9 (left of column 10's 4). Then, row 8 (index 8) in the input has a horizontal line of 4s (columns 3-7). The output row 8 is the same. But in row 7 of the output, there's a pattern of 3s. So maybe the 4s in row 8 are adding 3s above them. Row 7, columns 3,5,7 are 3s. Each 4 in row 8's columns 3-7 would have a 3 above (row 7, same column). But in the input row 7, those columns are 0. The output row 7 has 3s in columns 3,5,7 and 0 in column 1. Wait, the input row 8 has 4s in columns 3-7, so columns 3,4,5,6,7. The output row 7 has 3s in columns 3,5,7. Not exactly matching. So maybe it's every other column? Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find another approach. Perhaps the transformation is that each non-zero number in the input is replaced with itself, and in addition, a new number (X-1) is placed in a specific adjacent cell based on the position of X. For example:\n\n- For each 4, place a 3 to the left.\n- For each 3, place a 1 to the right.\n- For each 2, place a 1 below.\n- For each 1, no action.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0:\n\nInput row 2 has 4s. So for each 4 in row 2, place a 3 to the left. The 4s are in columns 1-5 and 10. Placing 3s to the left would affect columns 0 (but 0 is already 0), columns 0, 2, 4, and 9. But the output row 2 has a 3 at column 9. So perhaps only the 4 at column 10 gets a 3 to the left (column 9). The others don't because the left cells are already part of the 4s. For example, the 4 at column 1 has left column 0 (already 0), but the output doesn't add a 3 there. So maybe only 4s that have a 0 to their left get a 3 added.\n\nWait, in row 2 of the input, the 4s start at column 1. The left of column 1 is column 0 (0), so maybe a 3 should be added there. But in the output, column 0 is 0. So that's not the case. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s that are at the end of a block. For example, the 4 at column 10 in row 2 is isolated from the main block. So the left of it is 0, so a 3 is added there. The other 4s are part of a contiguous block, so their left is another 4, so no 3 is added. That could be possible.\n\nSo the rule might be: for each 4 that has a 0 to the left, add a 3 to the left. Similarly for other numbers. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, row 2, column 10's 4 has a 0 to the left (column 9). So add 3 there. That fits.\n\nThen, in Example 1's input, row 5 has a 2 at column 9. The output adds a 1 to the left (column 8). So maybe for 2s, add a 1 to the left if possible.\n\nAnother example: Example 1's input row 11 (the one with 4,4,4,2). The output has a 3 in row 12, column 3. Wait, the input row 11 is [0,0,0,4,4,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output row 12 is [0,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 2 in column 6 adds a 1 to the left (column 5). But how does the 4s in row 11 add 3s? The output row 12 has a 3 in column 3. Maybe each 4 in row 11 adds a 3 below. The 4s in columns 3,4,5. Below them in row 12, column 3 is 3. So maybe for 4s, add a 3 below. But in Example 0, the 4s in row 8 (input) are columns 3-7. The output row 7 has 3s in columns 3,5,7. So maybe every other column? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each 4 in the input, add a 3 below. Let's check Example 0's input row 8, columns 3-7 are 4s. The output row 7 has 3s in columns 3,5,7. So yes, each 4 in row 8 adds a 3 in row 7. But why columns 3,5,7 and not 4,6? Maybe the 4s are placed in columns 3-7, and every other column adds a 3. Or perhaps only certain positions.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Let's try to summarize the possible rules based on the examples:\n\n- 4s generate 3s in certain positions (left or below).\n- 3s generate 1s in certain positions (right or below).\n- 2s generate 1s to the left or below.\n\nBut the exact pattern isn't clear. Let's try to codify the rules:\n\nFrom Example 0:\n\n- A 4 at (2,10) \u21923 at (2,9) (left).\n- The 4s in row 8 (columns 3-7) generate 3s in row 7, columns 3,5,7 (each below their respective 4s).\n- The 3s in row 3 (columns 1,3,5) generate 1s in row 3, columns 11 (not sure how).\n\nFrom Example 1:\n\n- The 2 in row 4, column 9 generates a 1 in row 5, column 8 (left and down?).\n- The 4s in row 11 generate 3s in row 12, columns 3,4,5, but only column 3 gets a 3. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe for 4s, the rule is to add a 3 to the left if possible (if the left cell is 0). For 3s, add a 1 to the right if possible. For 2s, add a 1 below if possible.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample 0's input row 2, column 10 is 4. Left is column 9 (0). Add 3. Correct.\n\nExample 0's input row 3, column 1 is 3. Right is column 2 (0). Add 1. But in the output row 3, column 2 is 0. So no. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 3s add a 1 below.\n\nExample 0's input row 3, column 1 is 3. Below is row 4, column 1 (0). Add 1. Output row 4, column 1 is 0. Not correct. So that doesn't work.\n\nExample 1's input row 4, column 9 is 2. Below is row 5, column 9 (0). Add 1. Output row 5, column 9 is 4. So no.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the numbers are being added in a way that forms a diamond or cross pattern around the original number. For example, a 4 adds 3s in the four surrounding cells (up, down, left, right), but only if those cells are 0. But looking at Example 0's output, the 4 at (2,10) adds a 3 to the left. Not other directions. So maybe only left.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is determined by the number modulo 4. For example, 4 mod 4 is 0 \u2192 left, 3 mod 4 is 3 \u2192 up, 2 mod 4 is 2 \u2192 down, 1 mod 4 is 1 \u2192 right. But this is a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is based on the value of the number. For example:\n\n- 4: left\n- 3: down\n- 2: right\n- 1: up\n\nThen, each number X places X-1 in that direction.\n\nExample 0's 4 at (2,10) places 3 to the left (correct).\n\nA 3 in (3,1) would place 2 down. Output row 4, column 1 is 0. Not present. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for the positions where new numbers are added in the output and see if they relate to the positions of certain numbers in the input.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the new numbers are:\n\nRow 2, col 9: 3 \u2192 adjacent to 4 at col 10.\n\nRow 3, col 11: 1 \u2192 adjacent to 4 at col 10 in row 3? No, row 3, col 10 is 4. So the 1 is to the right of 4. But 4's generated number is 3. Not 1.\n\nWait, in row 3, col 10 is 4. So according to the previous rule, a 3 should be added to the left. But in the input row 3, col 10 is 4 (from input row 3's original input). So output row 3, col 9 is 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new numbers are added in a way that connects different blocks. For example, the 4s in row 2 generate 3s to the left, which then generate 1s to the right. But in the output row 3, col 9 is 0. So that's not the case.\n\nThis is challenging. Let's look at the test input and see if applying any of these hypotheses can generate the output.\n\nTest Input:\n\nThe test input is a 15-column grid. Let's look for 4s, 3s, 2s.\n\nRows 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11 have non-zero numbers.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,4,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,4,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,4,4,1,0,0,0,0,4,4,2,0,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 10: [0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 11: [0,2,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nAssuming the pattern is to add numbers to the left of 4s, below 2s, and to the right of 3s, for example.\n\nLooking at row 3 of the test input: columns 2 and 3 are 4s, column 4 is 2. Let's see. The 4s might add 3s to the left. Column 2's 4 is at position 2, so left is column 1 (0). So add 3. Column 3's 4 would add 3 to column 2 (but column 2 is already 4). So no. The 2 at column 4 would add a 1 below (row 4, column 4). Let's check row 4, column 4 in the test input: it's 4. So no change. Hmm.\n\nRow 4 of test input: column 2 is 4 (left would be column 1, which is 0 \u2192 add 3). Column 4 is 4 (left is column 3, which is 0 \u2192 add 3). Column 10 is 4 (left is column 9, 0 \u2192 add 3). Column 12 is 4 (left is column 11, 0 \u2192 add 3). \n\nRow 5: column 3,4 are 4s, column 5 is 1. The 4s would add 3s to the left. Column 3's left is column 2 (0 \u2192 add 3). Column 4's left is column 3 (4 \u2192 no). The 1 in column 5 does nothing. The 2 in column 12 would add a 1 below (row 6, column 12 \u2192 0, but row 6 is all zeros except the middle. So maybe add 1 there.\n\nRow 9: has 4s in columns 1,2 and 8,9. Left of column 1's 4 is column 0 (0 \u2192 add 3). Column 2's 4's left is column 1 (4 \u2192 no). Column 8's 4's left is column 7 (0 \u2192 add 3). Column 9's 4's left is column 8 (4 \u2192 no).\n\nRow 10: 4s at columns 1,3,8,10. Left of 1's 4 is 0 \u2192 add 3. 3's 4's left is column 2 (0 \u2192 add 3). 8's 4's left is column 7 (0 \u2192 add 3). 10's 4's left is column 9 (0 \u2192 add 3).\n\nRow 11: 2 at column 1. Add a 1 below (row 12, column 1 \u2192 0). 4s in columns 2,3,8,9. Add 3s to the left of each where possible. Column 2's left is 1 (2 \u2192 no). Column 3's left is column 2 (4 \u2192 no). Columns 8 and 9: left of 8 is 7 (0 \u2192 add 3). Left of 9 is 8 (4 \u2192 no).\n\nThis would add a lot of 3s and 1s. But how does this fit with the training examples' outputs?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 4 adds a 3 to the left, each 3 adds a 1 to the right, each 2 adds a 1 below. Let's apply this to the test input.\n\nRow 3: 4 at columns 2 and 3. Adding 3s to columns 1 and 2 (but column 2 is already 4 in row 3, so only column 1 gets 3. The 2 in column 4 adds a 1 below (row 4, column 4).\n\nRow 4: 4s at columns 2,4,10,12. Add 3s to the left (columns 1,3,9,11). The 3 in column 5 adds a 1 to the right (column 6).\n\nRow 5: 4s at 3,4,10,11. Add 3s to columns 2,3,9,10. The 1 in column 5 does nothing. The 2 in column 12 adds a 1 below (row 6, column 12).\n\nRow 9: 4s at 1,2,8,9. Add 3s to columns 0,1,7,8. The 2 in column 8 adds a 1 below (row 10, column 8).\n\nRow 10: 4s at 1,3,8,10. Add 3s to columns 0,2,7,9. The 4 in column 3's left is 2 (0 \u2192 add 3). The 4 in column 8's left is 7 (0 \u2192 add 3). The 4 in column 10's left is 9 (0 \u2192 add 3).\n\nRow 11: 2 in column 1 adds a 1 below (row 12, column 1). 4s in columns 2,3,8,9. Add 3s to columns 1,2,7,8. But column 1 has a 2, so only 2's left is column 0, but 2's direction is adding 1 below.\n\nApplying all these would result in adding numerous 3s and 1s in specific positions. But this is just a hypothesis based on the initial examples. However, looking at the training outputs, sometimes new numbers are added in positions not directly adjacent. For example, in Example 0's output row 3, column 11 is 1. The input's row 3 has a 4 in column 10. So perhaps the 4's generated 3 (column 9) then generates a 1 to the right (column 10+1=11? But the 3 is at column 9. If 3s generate 1s to the right, then column 9's 3 would generate a 1 in column 10, which is already 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time I have, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each number X adds X-1 to the left if possible (0 cell). For 4\u21923 to the left, 3\u21922 to the left, 2\u21921 to the left, and 1\u21920 (no action). But the training examples don't follow this strictly, as Example 0's 3s don't generate 2s. Alternatively, perhaps only 4s generate 3s to the left, and 2s generate 1s below.\n\nLet's try applying this to the test input.\n\nFor each 4 in the input, add a 3 to the left if that cell is 0.\n\nFor each 2, add a 1 below if possible.\n\nFor each 3, maybe add a 1 to the right.\n\nBut the examples show that 3s can generate 1s in certain positions. For example, Example 0's row 3 has 3s, and the output adds 1s in row 3, column 11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 3s generate 1s to the right.\n\nSo applying:\n\n- 4 \u21923 to the left.\n- 3 \u21921 to the right.\n- 2 \u21921 below.\n\nLet's try this on the test input.\n\nRow 3: columns 2 and 3 are 4. Add 3s to columns 1 and 2. But column 2 is already 4 in row 3, so only column 1 gets 3. Also, column 4 is 2 \u2192 add 1 below (row 4, column 4). But row 4, column 4 is 4, so no.\n\nRow 4: 4s at columns 2,4,10,12. Add 3s to columns 1,3,9,11. The 3 in column 5 adds a 1 to the right (column 6).\n\nRow 5: 4s at columns 3,4,10,11. Add 3s to columns 2,3,9,10. The 1 in column 5 does nothing. The 2 in column 12 adds 1 below (row 6, column 12).\n\nRow 9: 4s at columns 1,2,8,9. Add 3s to columns 0,1,7,8. The 2 in column 8 adds 1 below (row 10, column 8).\n\nRow 10: 4s at columns 1,3,8,10. Add 3s to columns 0,2,7,9. The 3 in column 5 (from row 4) adds 1 to the right (column 6).\n\nRow 11: 2 in column 1 adds 1 below (row 12, column 1). 4s at columns 2,3,8,9. Add 3s to columns 1,2,7,8.\n\nNow, let's try to construct the output based on these rules.\n\nBut this is a bit tedious. Let's see:\n\nFor example, in row 3 of test input:\n\nOriginal: [0,0,4,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nAdd 3 to the left of each 4 where possible.\n\n- Column 2 (4): left is column 1 (0) \u2192 add 3.\n- Column 3 (4): left is column 2 (4) \u2192 no.\n- Columns 10 and 11 (4s): left of 10 is 9 (0) \u2192 add 3. Left of 11 is 10 (4) \u2192 no.\n\nSo row 3 becomes: [0,3,4,4,2,0,0,0,0,3,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nThen, the 2 in column 4 adds a 1 below (row 4, column 4). But row 4's column 4 is 4, so no change.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,4,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0]\n\nAdd 3 to the left of each 4:\n\n- Column 2 (4): left is 1 (0) \u2192 add 3.\n- Column 4 (4): left is 3 (0) \u2192 add 3.\n- Column 10 (4): left is 9 (0) \u2192 add 3.\n- Column 12 (4): left is 11 (0) \u2192 add 3.\n\nSo row 4 becomes: [0,3,4,3,4,3,0,0,0,3,4,3,4,0,0]\n\nThen, the 3 in column 5 adds a 1 to the right (column 6).

        "cot_2": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples. Let me start by looking closely at each example.\n\nStarting with Example 0. Let's compare the input and output. The input has several rows with numbers like 4, 3, 2, etc. The output seems to add new numbers in certain positions. For instance, in row 3 of the input, there's a 3, 0, 3, 0, 3 sequence. In the output, the last element of that row becomes a 1. Also, looking at the third row from the bottom in the input (index 8 maybe?), there's a 4,4,4,4,4. In the output, that row has some 3s added in the next rows. Hmm. Maybe there's some kind of flow or movement happening here.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's input, there's a vertical line of 4s in column 10 (assuming 0-based indexing). In the output, those 4s are still there, but some numbers like 3 and 1 appear around them. Maybe the numbers are being propagated downwards or in some direction, but only under certain conditions.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input has a 4,4,4,1 in the third row. In the output, the 1 is still there. Then, in row 5 (0-based) of the input, after some zeros, the output has a 1 inserted. Also, in row 7 of the output, there are 3s appearing where there were zeros in the input. Maybe when a certain number is present, it creates a pattern or adds adjacent numbers. For example, a 2 might cause a 1 to appear nearby, or a 3 might lead to some 3s spreading.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the row with 3s in the input (row 3) ends up with a 1 at the end. Also, looking at the vertical 4s in column 10, in the output, around them, there are 3s and 1s. Maybe when a number is adjacent to a 4, it triggers some change. Or perhaps numbers are following a specific rule based on their neighbors.\n\nAnother approach: Let's check if the transformation is based on some cellular automaton-like rules. For example, each cell's new value depends on its neighbors in the input. But the output numbers don't directly correspond to counts of neighbors. Alternatively, maybe each number type (1, 2, 3, 4) has a specific behavior when they're adjacent to others.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has a 2 in row 1, column 4, and in the output, that's still a 2. But in row 6 of the input, there's a 4,4,4, which in the output becomes followed by a 1. Similarly, in row 7, a 0 becomes a 3. Hmm. So maybe when a 4 is part of a horizontal line, certain numbers (like 1 or 3) are added next to them. But the rules aren't obvious yet.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are part of a path that's being extended. For example, 4s could form a line, and then 3s or 1s are added as a continuation. Or perhaps there's a hierarchy where 4 is the highest, and lower numbers (3, 2, 1) follow in some order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output adds numbers that are one less than the input numbers in certain positions. But looking at Example 0, the input has a 2 in row 1, column 5. The output keeps it as 2, but in row 3, column 10, the 4 becomes 4. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother angle: looking for specific patterns in the input that get transformed. For example, in Example 0's input row 3 is 3,0,3,0,3. The output row 3 is 3,0,3,0,3,0,4,1. So the 1 is added after the 4. Maybe when a 3 is followed by a 0 and then a 4, a 1 is placed there. Not sure.\n\nLooking at the vertical lines. In Example 0, the vertical 4s in column 10. In the output, around them, especially below, there are 3s and 1s. Maybe the 4s act like a source, and numbers below them get updated. For example, under each 4 in a column, the next cell down becomes a 3, then a 2, then 1, etc. But in Example 0's input, the 4s are in row 2 column 10, and the output in row 3 column 10 is 4, then row 4 column 10 is 4, etc. So that's not the case. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is created by adding numbers of the next lower value adjacent to existing numbers. For example, a 4 would have a 3 next to it, a 3 would have a 2, and so on. Let's check. In Example 0's input, the 4s in row 2 are part of a horizontal line. In the output, adjacent to them (maybe below or above) we have 3s. For example, row 3, column 9 in the output is 3. That's adjacent to the 4s. Then, perhaps each number propagates its decremented value to neighboring cells. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number in the input causes a certain number to be placed in specific relative positions. For example, a 4 might add a 3 to the right, down, left, or up. But in the outputs, the positions where new numbers are added vary. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output: in row 5, column 8 (0-based?), the input was 0, and the output is 1. The input row 5 has a 4 in column 9. Maybe the 4 in column 9 (input row 5) causes a 1 to appear to the left (column 8) in the output. Similarly, in row 7 of the output, there are 3s around the 4 in column 9. Maybe the 4 in row 5, column 9 (input) causes 3s to appear below or around in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a cell has a certain number, the output cell below it is modified. For example, a 2 in the input might cause a 1 to be placed below it. But in Example 0's input row 1 has a 2 in column 5. The output row 3 column 11 has a 1. Not directly below.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are part of a diagonal pattern. For instance, a 4 in a cell might lead to a 3 diagonally down-right. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where new numbers are added in the outputs and see what's in the input around those positions.\n\nTake Example 0's output row 3, column 11 (the 1). In the input, the cell below that (row 4, column 11) is 0, but in the input, the cell above (row 2, column 10) is 4. Maybe that 4 is influencing the 1's placement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of multiple transformations. For example, certain numbers are moved, others are added based on proximity.\n\nWait, looking at all examples, the output seems to add numbers that are lower (by 1) adjacent to higher numbers. For instance, a 4 in the input could have 3s added next to it. A 3 could have 2s, etc. But in Example 0, the input has a 2 in row 1, column 5, and the output has a 1 in row 3, column 11. That's not adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a direction involved. For instance, numbers flow downward, and each step they decrease. So a 4 in the input would create a 3 below it, then a 2 below that, etc. Let's check. In Example 0's input, there's a vertical line of 4s in column 10. The output has 4s in the same positions, but in the row below (row 6, column 10) there's a 4, then row 7 column 10 is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe each number in the input is part of a \"chain\" that extends in a certain direction in the output. For example, a 4 in the input could be the head, and the output adds a 3 next to it, then a 2, etc., forming a snake-like pattern. But how does this explain the positions where the new numbers appear?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the numbers are being connected in a way that creates paths. For instance, 4s form a horizontal line, and then 3s are added vertically next to them. Or something similar.\n\nLet me look at Example 2's output. In row 6, column 10, there's a 1 added. The input has a 4,4,4 in row 6, columns 7-9. The output adds a 1 at column 10. Then, in row 7, column 9, there's a 3. Maybe the 4s in row 6 lead to a 3 and 1 being added to the right or below.\n\nAnother possibility: the numbers represent different layers or elements that interact. For example, 4s might be walls, and 3s, 2s, 1s are other elements that are placed according to some rules relative to the walls.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is adding the next number in a sequence where possible. For example, if a cell has a number, check adjacent cells and if they are zero, add the next lower number. So a 4 would add 3s in adjacent zeros, a 3 adds 2s, etc. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 2 has 4s. Adjacent to them, in row 3 column 9, the output has a 3. So maybe the 4s in row 2, columns 1-5 (assuming 0-based) are causing a 3 to be added in the cell below (row 3, column 9? Wait, the positions don't match. Maybe it's the right or left neighbor. Alternatively, maybe the 4s in row 2 have their lower neighbors (row 3) set to 3. But in row 3 of the input, there are 3s already. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers could be part of a puzzle where each number represents a different color or state, and the transformation is applying a specific rule set, such as in a board game where numbers spread or change based on certain conditions.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output seems to have more numbers than the input, particularly 1s, 2s, 3s added in positions adjacent to existing numbers. For example, in Example 0's output, the 3s are added in row 8, columns 3-7. The input row 8 has 4s in those columns. So maybe the 4s are replaced by 3s, but wait, in the output, the 4s remain. So that's not it.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input row 8: [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]. Output row 8 is [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0], so same as input. But the output's row 7 is [0,0,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]. That row's input was all zeros. So the 3s in row 7 must have been added based on something. Perhaps the 4s in row 8 caused the 3s to appear in row 7. So the 4s below cause 3s above. That seems possible. So if there's a horizontal line of 4s in row N, then in row N-1, 3s are placed in certain positions. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, row 8 (input) has 4s. Output row 7 (the row above) has 3s. So yes. So a horizontal line of 4s in row N causes the row above (N-1) to have 3s spaced every other cell. Similarly, maybe a horizontal line of 3s would cause 2s above, etc.\n\nSo, the pattern could be:\n\nFor each horizontal sequence of the same number (like 4s), in the output, the row above that sequence has a sequence of the next lower number (3s) placed in positions that are offset or alternated. \n\nLooking at Example 0's input row 2 has 4s in columns 1-5. The output row 3 (the row below) has 3s in columns 1,3,5 (the same positions). So maybe the 4s in row 2 generate 3s in the same columns but the row below? Wait, in Example 0's input row 2 is 0,4,4,4,4,4,0... Output row 3 (next row) is 0,3,0,3,0,3,0... So the 3s are in the same columns as the 4s but in the next row, but spaced every other. Wait, columns 1,3,5. The original 4s were columns 1-5 (all). So every other column. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s in a horizontal line in row N generate 3s in the same columns but in row N+1, but only if the next row's cell is zero. But in Example 0's row 2 (input) has 4s in columns 1-5. The output row 3 (next row) has 3s in columns 1,3,5, which were zeros in the input. So maybe 4s generate 3s in the same columns below, but only every other cell. That could be a possible rule.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's input row 4 has 3s in columns 2-4. The output row 5 (next row) has a 1 in column 8. Not sure. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s in Example 0's output row 7 are generated by the 4s in row 8. The 4s are in columns 3-7. The 3s in row 7 are columns 3,5,7. So every other column. So the pattern for a horizontal line of number X in row N would generate (X-1) in row N-1 (above) in every other column of the same horizontal span.\n\nBut how does this explain other numbers like 1 and 2?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input row 1 has a 2 in column 5. The output row 3 column 11 has a 1. Not sure how they are connected. Maybe the 2 generates a 1 in some direction. Or perhaps vertical lines of numbers also affect adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers could represent steps in a path. For example, a 4 followed by a 3, then 2, then 1. But how are these placed?\n\nLet me try to think of another angle. The input might be a grid where each number represents a \"height\" and the output is some kind of erosion or deposition process. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, numbers could represent pipes or connections. For instance, 4 is a straight pipe, and 3s are bends, etc. But how does that lead to the output?\n\nWait, another observation: in Example 0's input, the 2 is in row 1 column 5. The output has a 1 in row 3 column 11. That's two rows down and six columns to the right. Not sure. Maybe the numbers are moving diagonally.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number is part of a sequence where each step decreases by 1 and moves in a certain direction. For example, 4 moves down, 3 moves right, 2 moves left, etc. But this is getting too vague.\n\nLet me try to find a common transformation across all examples. Let's take a cell in the input and see how it's transformed in the output.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's input row 3 has 3s in columns 1,3,5. The output row 3 has those 3s but adds a 1 in column 11. So perhaps the 3s are not changed, but new numbers are added elsewhere. The 1 in column 11 might be related to the 4s in column 10. For instance, a 4 to the left of a 0 could generate a 1 to the right. Like 4 \u2192 3 \u2192 2 \u2192 1 in some direction.\n\nAnother approach: numbers in the output are either the same as input or lower, but added in specific positions. For example, when a 4 is present, a 3 is placed adjacent, and a 3 places a 2, etc. This could form a chain of numbers decreasing by 1 in a certain direction.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, in row 3 column 10 is 4 (same as input). Then column 11 is 1. So maybe 4's next is 1? Doesn't fit. Or 4 is followed by 3, then 2, then 1. Maybe in a diagonal direction. For example, row 3 column 10 is 4, row 4 column 10 is 4, row 5 column 10 is 4, row 6 column 10 is 4. Then in row 6 column 11 is 2, row 7 column 11 is 2. Then the 2s might generate 1s nearby. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a number is present, the next number (decremented by 1) is placed at a certain relative position. For instance, a 4 in a cell places a 3 below it, a 3 places a 2 to the right, a 2 places a 1 above. But this varies per example.\n\nAnother idea: the numbers form a loop where 4 \u21923\u21922\u21921\u21920, but how does that lead to their placement?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers could be counts of neighboring cells of a certain type. But that's more of a cellular automaton approach.\n\nWait, maybe the output is created by applying a convolution or kernel to the input. For example, each cell is transformed based on its neighbors. For instance, if a cell has a 4, then the cell below it becomes 3, the cell to the right becomes 3, etc. But I need to see if this holds across examples.\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 2 has 4s. The row below (row 3) has 3s in the same columns. So maybe each 4 in the input causes a 3 below. But in Example 1's input, row 2 has 4,4,4,1. The output row 3 has 4 in column 4. But there's no 3 below. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 4 in the input places a 3 diagonally down-right. Let's check. Example 0's row 2 column 1 (4) \u2192 row 3 column 2 is 0. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are part of a crossword-like pattern where the output connects the numbers in a certain way. For example, horizontal 4s and vertical 3s intersecting. But this is vague.\n\nLet me think about the possible steps:\n\n1. For each cell in the input grid:\n   a. If the cell is non-zero, look in certain directions (up, down, left, right) and place the next lower number in those directions if the cell is zero.\n\nBut how does this work in the examples?\n\nIn Example 0's row 2 (input), columns 1-5 are 4s. The output row 3 (same columns) have 3s, but only in columns 1,3,5. So every other column. So perhaps the 4s generate 3s in the same columns but the next row, but only in alternating positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s generate 3s in the same row, but shifted. For example, every 4 in column x generates a 3 in column x+1. But that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the output for a row is generated by looking at the row below. For example, if a row has a sequence of 4s, then the row above it gets 3s in the same positions. But in Example 0's input row 8 has 4s, output row 7 has 3s. So row above gets 3s. Similarly, input row 2 has 4s, output row 3 has 3s. Wait, that's the row below. So inconsistency here.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, row 8 has 4s. Output row 7 (the row above) has 3s. So maybe a horizontal line of X in row N causes row N-1 to have X-1 in the same positions. But how does that apply to row 2's 4s causing row 3's 3s (same row N+1).\n\nThis is conflicting. Maybe there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s in row 8 (input) are in columns 3-7. The output row 7 has 3s in columns 3,5,7. So every other column. Similarly, in row 2's 4s (columns 1-5), the output row 3 has 3s in columns 1,3,5. So every other column. So perhaps for a horizontal line of X's, the row above has X-1 in every other column. But why every other?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for a horizontal line of X's in the input, the output places X-1 in every other cell of the same row's neighboring rows. For example, above and below, every other column.\n\nBut how does this explain the other numbers like 1 and 2?\n\nIn Example 0's input row 1 has a 2. The output has that 2, and in row 3 column 11, a 1. Maybe the 2 in row 1 column 5 causes a 1 to be placed two rows down and 6 columns to the right. That doesn't seem to fit any pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number creates a vertical line of decremented numbers below it. For example, a 4 creates a 3 below, then a 2, then a 1. But looking at Example 0's input column 10 has 4s in rows 2-6. The output has 4s in those positions, but also 3s and 1s nearby. So perhaps each 4 in a column leads to a 3 in the same column, next row, but in the output. Wait, in Example 0's input, row 2 column 10 is 4. Output row 3 column 10 is 4. So no change. Then where do the 3s come from?\n\nIn Example 0's output, row 3 column 9 is 3, which is adjacent to the 4 in column 10. So maybe 4s generate 3s to the left. Then, 3s generate 2s to the left, and so on. But in row 3 column 9 is 3, which is next to the 4 in column 10. Then, in the output row 3 column 9 is 3, which might generate a 2 in column 8, but looking at row 4, column 9 in the output is 3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, each number generates a lower number to the left. So a 4 generates a 3 to the left, a 3 generates a 2 to the left, etc. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input row 2 column 10 is 4. The output row 3 column 9 is 3. So the 4 generated a 3 to the left and below. Then, in row 3 column 9's 3, the output row 4 column 8 would have a 2. But looking at Example 0's output row 4 column 9 is 3. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is diagonally down-left. For example, a 4 at (row, col) generates a 3 at (row+1, col-1). Let's check:\n\nExample 0's row 2 column 10 (4) \u2192 row 3 column 9 (3). That works. Then row 3 column 9 (3) \u2192 row 4 column 8 (2). But in the output, row 4 column 9 is 3, not 2. So that doesn't fit. Maybe this is part of the pattern but not the whole story.\n\nIn Example 0's output row 4 column 9 is 3. The input row 4 column 9 is 0. So where did that 3 come from? Perhaps from the 4 in row 3 column 10. If so, then (row, column) (3,10) is 4 \u2192 (4,9) is 3. So diagonally down-left. Then, that 3 in (4,9) would generate a 2 at (5,8), but in the output row 5 column 9 is 0. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, each number generates the next lower number in the same direction. For example, if a 4 is in a cell, the cell to the left becomes 3, the cell below becomes 3, etc., but only one direction per number. \n\nAlternatively, the numbers are following a specific path. For example, starting from a 2, the path moves in a certain direction, placing 1s. But this is unclear.\n\nLet me look at another example. In Example 1's input row 11 has 4,4,4,2. In the output, row 12 (the row below) has 3,0,1,0. Hmm. The 2 is in column 6, and row 12 column 5 is 1. So perhaps the 2 generates a 1 below and to the left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is a combination of multiple rules. For example, horizontal lines of X generate X-1 in the row above/below, and vertical lines generate X-1 to the left/right. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: look at the differences between input and output for each example.\n\nIn Example 0, the output adds:\n\n- In row 3, column 9: 3\n- In row 3, column 11: 1\n- Row 4, column 9: 3\n- Row 5, column 9: 0 \u2192 3?\n- Wait, maybe I should list all the changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by placing numbers decremented by 1 in specific positions relative to their original positions, such as diagonally down-right or something. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are part of a numbering system where each number is a step in a process, and the output represents the next step. For example, 4 becomes 3, 3 becomes 2, etc., but the placement depends on movement rules.\n\nWait, another observation: in Example 0's output, the 1s are placed at the ends of certain sequences. For example, row 3 column 11 is 1, which is next to a 4 in column 10. Similarly, row 6 column 11 is 2, which might be part of a sequence. Maybe the 4s are followed by 3s and then 2s and 1s in a particular direction.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers could represent a pipe system where 4 is a straight pipe, 3 is a bend, and 1 is an end. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should try to find a general rule that explains all the changes.\n\nLooking at the test input. The input has some 4s arranged in a pattern. For example, row 3 has 4,4,2. Row 4 has 4,0,4. Row 5 has 0,4,4,1. Then in row 9-11, there are 4s arranged in a pattern. The output should follow the same pattern as the training examples. So, according to the possible rules I've thought of, like adding lower numbers adjacent to higher ones, especially in certain directions.\n\nAssuming that for each 4 in the input, the output places a 3 in the cell diagonally down-left. For example, a 4 at (row, col) \u2192 3 at (row+1, col-1). Then, each 3 would place a 2 in the same direction, etc. Let's see if this works for the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 2 column 1 (4) would place a 3 at row 3 column 0. But in the output row 3 column 0 is 0. So no. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 4 places a 3 to the right. Example 0's input row 2 column 1 (4) \u2192 3 in row 2 column 2. But row 2 in the output is still 4,4,4,4,4. So no.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by placing the next lower number in the cell directly below if it's zero. So for each cell with value X > 0, if the cell below is 0, set it to X-1. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's input row 2 column 1 (4) \u2192 row 3 column 1 is 3. In the output, row 3 column 1 is 3. Yes, that works. Similarly, row 2 column 2 (4) \u2192 row 3 column 2 is 0 in input. Output row 3 column 2 is 4. Wait, no. In Example 0's output row 3 column 2 is 0. Hmm, this doesn't fit. So maybe the rule is not that.\n\nAlternatively, if a cell has X, and the cell below has X-1, but only if the cell below is zero. But in Example 0's input row 2 column 1 is 4. The cell below (row 3 column 1) is 0. So output row 3 column 1 becomes 3. Yes. Then, row 3 column 1 (3) would check if the cell below (row 4 column 1) is zero. If yes, set to 2. But in the output row 4 column 1 is 0. So why isn't it 2? Because maybe the rule only applies once per cell in the input. So each cell in the input propagates X-1 below once.\n\nBut in the output, some cells have new X-1 values that were not in the input. For example, in Example 0's output row 7 has 3s. Those were zeros in the input. How are they generated?\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is applied to the output iteratively. For example, first propagate 4s down as 3s, then 3s down as 2s, etc. But this would require multiple passes.\n\nBut given that the training examples show a single transformation step, perhaps it's a one-pass process.\n\nAnother approach: the output is the result of each non-zero cell in the input propagating its value-1 to the cell below and to the right, but only if those cells are zero. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input row 2 column 1 (4) \u2192 cell below (row3 col1) is 0 \u2192 becomes 3. Cell to the right (row2 col2) is 4, so no change. Then row3 col1 (3) \u2192 cell below (row4 col1) is 0 \u2192 becomes 2, and cell to the right (row3 col2) is 0 \u2192 becomes 2. But in the output, row4 col1 is 0, so this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the test input and apply the possible rules I've thought of.\n\nThe test input has several 4s arranged in patterns. For example, in row 3, there's a 4,4,2. Row 4 has 4,0,4. Row 5 has 0,4,4,1. Also, rows 9-11 have 4s in a pattern.\n\nApplying the rule that each 4 adds a 3 below and to the left. For example, a 4 in row 3, column 3 would add a 3 in row 4, column 2. But the input row 4, column 2 is 0. Output would have 3 there. Similarly, a 4 in row 3, column 4 would add a 3 in row 4, column 3. Input row 4, column 3 is 0, so output would have 3.\n\nIn the test input's row 4, columns 2 and 4 are 4. So these would generate 3s below them. For example, row 5, columns 1 and 3 (if the direction is down-left). But in row 5, column 2 is 4, which might generate a 3 in row 6, column 1.\n\nBut this is all guesswork. Given the time constraints, I'll try to apply a rule where each 4 in the input generates a 3 in the cell below and to the left, each 3 generates a 2 in the same direction, and so on. Similarly, 2s generate 1s. Let's apply this to the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input's row 3:\n\nColumns 2-4: [4,4,2]. So the 4s here would generate 3s below and to the left (row 4, columns 1 and 2, and row 4 column 3). But the 2 would generate a 1 below and to the left.\n\nRow 4's columns 2 and 4 are 4s. These would generate 3s in row 5, columns 1 and 3.\n\nRow 5's columns 3 and 4 are 4s. Generating 3s in row 6, columns 2 and 3.\n\nRow 9 has 4s in columns 1 and 2. Generate 3s in row 10, columns 0 and 1.\n\nRow 10's columns 1 and 3 are 4s. Generate 3s in row 11, columns 0 and 2.\n\nRow 11 has 2,4,4 in columns 1-3. The 4s here generate 3s in row 12, columns 0 and 2. The 2 generates a 1 in row 12, column 2-1=1.\n\nThis could explain some of the additions. Additionally, the existing 3s in the input (row 2 column 3) would generate 2s below and to the left.\n\nBut this is a guess, and given the time I have, I'll proceed to generate an output based on this rule, hoping it matches the training examples' patterns.",
