        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples, then apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input has a central structure with 7s and 4s. The output seems to add more numbers around them. Let me compare the input and output row by row. In the input's row 4 (0-indexed maybe?), there's [0,0,0,4,7,4,0,0,0,0]. The output's row 5 becomes [0,0,7,7,4,7,7,0,0,0]. Wait, so the 7s are spreading out? Also, there are new 4s appearing in rows 3 and 7. Maybe it's some kind of expansion or mirroring.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 3 and some 6s. The output adds 3s and 6s around them. For instance, the 3 in row 3, column 1 in the input leads to 3s in row 3, columns 4 and 6, and in row 6, column 1 and 4. The 6s spread out to adjacent positions. So perhaps the pattern is to create symmetrical points or reflections around certain axes.\n\nExample 2: Input has 9s and 8s. The output adds 9s in a symmetrical pattern. The original 9 is at (2,6), and the output has 9s at (2,2) and (6,6), maybe mirroring across the vertical axis of the grid. The 8s form a horizontal line, but in the output, the 9s are placed symmetrically around them.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that for each non-zero number in the input, the output places copies of that number in positions that are symmetrical relative to the center of the grid or some axis. Alternatively, it could be creating a diamond or cross shape around each number.\n\nWait, let me check the positions more precisely. For Example 0's input, the 7s are in the middle rows. The output adds 4s diagonally. For example, the original 7 is in the center (row 4, column 4?), and then there's a 4 above and below, maybe forming a diamond pattern. The output's row 3 has 4s at positions 2 and 6. Hmm, maybe each number is mirrored in some way. Or perhaps each cell with a number is used to generate new numbers in certain directions.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is created by taking each non-zero cell in the input and placing copies of its value in specific positions relative to it, such as diagonally or in a cross shape. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has a 7 at (3,4) and (5,3) and (5,5). The output has 7s spreading out. Wait, the output's row 5 (middle row) has 7s in columns 2,3,5,6. So maybe each 7 in the input is generating 7s to the left and right, but that doesn't explain the 4s. Alternatively, the numbers might alternate. Like 7 and 4 are part of a cycle, and each step the numbers change based on their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a result of some cellular automaton-like rules where each cell's value is determined by its neighbors in the input. For instance, if a cell has a non-zero value, then in the output, certain neighboring cells take on a related value. Let's see.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, the 7 in the middle is surrounded by 4s. The output has more 4s and 7s arranged symmetrically. Maybe the pattern is that each number is surrounded by another number in a specific direction. For example, 7s are surrounded by 4s in the input, so in the output, those 4s generate new 7s in their adjacent cells. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a rotation or reflection.\n\nWait, in Example 2's output, the 9s are mirrored both left and right. The original 9 is at (2,6) in the input, and in the output, there's a 9 at (2,2) and (6,6), which suggests a reflection over the vertical center line (since the grid is 10x10, columns 0-9, center is between 4 and 5). So (2,6) mirrored over the vertical center would be (2,3), but in the output, there's a 9 at (2,2). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the original 9 is in column 6 (0-based index), and the mirrored 9 is in column 3 (since 9-6=3, but 6 is 6, so 9-6-1=2? Maybe that's not right. Alternatively, the grid is mirrored left-right, so column x becomes column 9 - x. For example, original 9 is at column 6. 9-6=3, so mirrored would be column 3. But in the output, there's a 9 at (2,2) and (6,6). Wait, perhaps there's both vertical and horizontal reflection. Original at (2,6) is mirrored vertically to (2,3), but in the output example 2, the 9s are at (2,2) and (6,6). Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is creating a cross shape. For example, in Example 0, the 7s form a vertical line, and the 4s form a diamond around them. Maybe the pattern is that each number is part of a certain shape, and the output creates symmetrical points based on that.\n\nLooking at the test input now. The input has a 2 in the center (row 2, column 4?), and surrounding 3s. Let's see. The input's row 3 has [0,3,3,3,2,3,0,0,0,0]. So maybe the 2 is in row 2, column 4, and the 3s are around it. The output might mirror these numbers in certain positions.\n\nIn Example 1, the input had a 3 at (3,1), and the output added 3s at (3,4) and (6,1) and (6,4). So maybe the 3 is mirrored both vertically and horizontally. For instance, if the original 3 is at (x,y), then the mirrored positions are (x, 9 - y) and (9 - x, y), but not sure. Alternatively, the output in Example 1 for the 3 creates a diamond shape: the original 3 is at (3,1), and in the output, there's a 3 at (3,4) and (6,1) and (6,4). That might suggest that for each 3 in the input, the output places 3s at positions that are 3 units away in some direction. Wait, (3,1) to (3,4) is 3 columns to the right, and (3,1) to (6,1) is 3 rows down, but then (6,4) is 3 columns right from (6,1). Hmm, maybe it's a cross with a certain distance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero number in the input is used to generate new numbers in the output at positions that are a knight's move away (like in chess, two in one direction and one in another), but that might not fit.\n\nAnother approach: The output seems to have numbers placed in symmetrical positions relative to the original input's positions. For example, in Example 0's input, the 7 is at (3,4) (assuming rows start at 0), and in the output, there are 4s at (3,2) and (3,6). Also, in row 5 (middle row), the 7s spread out. Maybe each non-zero number in the input is creating a diamond shape around it in the output, with a certain radius. For example, if the original number is at (x,y), then in the output, numbers are placed at (x \u00b1 1, y), (x, y \u00b11), and (x \u00b11, y \u00b11) depending on the value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the output are generated by adding the original number to cells that are a certain distance away. For instance, in Example 0, the 7 in the center causes 4s to be placed two cells away in the four diagonal directions, then the 4s in the input (from the center) lead to 7s in their adjacent cells. But this might be a stretch.\n\nLooking back at the examples, the outputs often have the same numbers as the inputs but arranged in a more symmetrical or expanded pattern. For instance, in Example 0, the 7s form a vertical line in the input, and the output creates a diamond shape with 7s and 4s. The 4s in the input are in a cross shape around the 7s, and the output extends that.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that each non-zero cell in the input is mirrored across the vertical and horizontal axes of the grid. For a 10x10 grid, the vertical axis is between columns 4 and 5 (since indices are 0-9), and the horizontal axis is between rows 4 and 5. So mirroring a cell (x,y) across the vertical axis would place a copy at (x, 9 - y), and across the horizontal axis at (9 - x, y). Then, combining both mirrors would place copies at (9 - x, 9 - y). Let's check if that works.\n\nTake Example 2's input. The original 9 is at (2,6) (assuming rows and columns are 0-based). Mirroring vertically would put it at (2,3), since 9 -6 =3. But in the output, there's a 9 at (2,2) and (6,6). Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the mirrors are across the center of the grid, which is at (4.5,4.5). So for a cell (x,y), its mirror across the vertical center is (x, 9 - y -1) = (x, 8 - y). Let's check. For the original 9 at (2,6), vertical mirror would be (2, 8-6)= (2,2), which matches the output's 9 at (2,2). The horizontal mirror would be (8-2,6)= (6,6), which matches the output's 9 at (6,6). So that fits. So the pattern is that each non-zero cell in the input is mirrored both vertically and horizontally across the grid's center, and those mirrored positions get the same number as the original.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0, the input has a 7 at (3,4). Mirroring vertically would place it at (3, 8-4)= (3,4) because 9-4-1=4. Wait, no. Let me clarify: the vertical mirror for a cell (x,y) would be (x, 9-1 - y) = (x, 8 - y). So for (3,4), mirror would be (3, 4), since 8-4=4. So that's the same cell. Hmm, that doesn't explain the 4s appearing. So maybe the pattern isn't just mirroring, but also something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero cell in the input is expanded in a cross or diamond pattern. For example, for each cell with value v, in the output, cells at a certain distance around it are set to v. Looking at Example 0's input, the 7s are at (3,4), (4,4), (5,3), (5,5), etc. The output has 7s spread out. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by adding cells in the four diagonal directions at a distance of 2. For instance, in Example 0's input, the 7 at (3,4) would have 4s placed at (3-2,4-2) = (1,2), but that's not the case. Alternatively, each cell's value is placed in adjacent cells based on some rule.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's input, the 7 is surrounded by 4s in a cross pattern. In the output, the 4s are expanded into a diamond, and the 7s are also expanded. Maybe each number in the input creates a diamond shape of the same number, but offset by their value. For example, 7 creates a diamond of 7s two cells away, and 4 creates diamonds one cell away. But that's speculative.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: the 3 is at (3,1). The output has 3s at (3,4), (6,1), and (6,4). So if you mirror (3,1) across the vertical center (column 4.5), you get (3, 8 -1)= (3,7). But that's not matching. Wait, 9-1-1=7? So column 7. But the output has a 3 at (3,4). Hmm, that's column 4, which is 3 units to the right of 1. Maybe the mirroring isn't exact. Alternatively, the distance from the original to the mirrored cell is calculated based on the value. For example, a 3 at (3,1) would generate copies 3 cells away in some directions.\n\nAlternatively, the output in each example adds new numbers in positions that are a certain number of steps away from the original, determined by the value of the original cell. For example, a cell with value v adds new cells at a distance v. But that doesn't fit. For instance, in Example 0, the 7s would need to be placed 7 cells away, which is impossible in a 10x10 grid.\n\nAlternatively, the number represents the radius of expansion. For example, a 7 would expand in all directions by 7 cells, but that's too large. Maybe the number determines the step count. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the input and output for each example, the output seems to have a symmetrical pattern. For example, in Example 0, the output is symmetrical both vertically and horizontally. Similarly, in Example 1, the output has symmetry. So maybe the pattern is to create a symmetrical version of the input by mirroring the existing numbers across both axes.\n\nBut how do the new numbers come into play? For instance, in Example 0, the input has a 7 at (3,4), and the output has 4s at (3,2) and (3,6), which are two columns away from the center. Then, the 4s in the input (like at (4,3)) could be mirrored to other positions. Wait, perhaps each non-zero number in the input is mirrored both horizontally and vertically, but then the mirrored numbers are added to the output along with the original.\n\nSo, for each cell (x,y) with value v, the output includes:\n\n- (x,y) as v\n- (x, 8 - y) as v (vertical mirror)\n- (8 - x, y) as v (horizontal mirror)\n- (8 - x, 8 - y) as v (both mirrors)\n\nBut in Example 0's input, the 7 at (3,4) would be mirrored vertically to (3,4) (since 8-4=4, same column), horizontally to (5,4) (since 8-3=5), and both mirrors to (5,4). So that would create 7s at (3,4), (5,4), (3,4), (5,4), which is redundant. But the output has 7s in row 5, columns 3 and 5. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the mirroring is done across the center points. For example, the center of the grid is at (4.5,4.5). So for a cell (x,y), the mirrored positions would be (9 - x, y), (x, 9 - y), and (9 -x,9 - y). Let's check Example 2. Original 9 is at (2,6). The mirrored positions would be (7,6), (2,3), and (7,3). But in the output, there's a 9 at (2,2) and (6,6). Wait, maybe my calculation is wrong. Wait, 9 - x where x is the row index. For a 10x10 grid, rows are 0-9. So the mirror of row 2 would be row 7 (since 9 -2=7). Similarly, column 6 would be mirrored to column 3 (9 -6=3). So original (2,6) would have mirrors at (2,3), (7,6), and (7,3). But in Example 2's output, the 9s are at (2,2) and (6,6). That doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirroring is done around the central cross (rows and columns 4 and 5). For example, a cell at (x,y) would be mirrored to (9 - x, y) and (x, 9 - y), but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's input, the 7s are arranged in a vertical line. The output's 7s form a horizontal line. So maybe the pattern is a rotation. Rotating the input 90 degrees would transpose the positions. But the numbers themselves are changing, so rotation alone isn't the answer.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation involves creating a symmetrical pattern by placing copies of each number in specific mirrored positions. For instance, each non-zero number in the input generates new numbers in positions that are mirrored across both the vertical and horizontal axes of the grid.\n\nLet me check Example 1 again. The input has a 3 at (3,1). If mirrored vertically, it would be at (3,8), but in the output, there's a 3 at (3,4). Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the number's value determines the direction or distance of the mirrored placement. For example, a 3 in the input causes copies to be placed 3 cells to the left and right. But in Example 1's output, the 3 at (3,1) has a copy at (3,4) which is 3 cells to the right (from column 1 to 4: 1+3=4). Similarly, there's a 3 at (6,1), which is 3 rows down from row 3. And a 3 at (6,4), which is 3 rows down and 3 columns right. So maybe for each cell (x,y) with value v, the output places v at (x, y+v), (x, y-v), (x+v, y), (x-v, y), etc. But in this case, the 3 is placed 3 cells away. Let's test this.\n\nOriginal 3 at (3,1). Adding 3 to column: (3,1+3)= (3,4). Subtracting 3 from column: (3,1-3)= (3,-2), which is invalid. Adding 3 to row: (3+3,1)= (6,1). Subtracting 3 from row: (0,1). So output would have 3s at (3,4), (6,1), and (0,1). In the output of Example 1, there's a 3 at (3,4), (6,1), and (6,4). The (6,4) isn't explained by this. Unless there's also a diagonal component. Maybe (3,1) + (3,3) movement in some way.\n\nAlternatively, the value determines how many steps to move in certain directions. For example, 3 could mean placing copies 3 cells up, down, left, right, etc. But in Example 1, the 3 is at (3,1). Moving 3 steps right would be column 4 (1+3=4). Moving 3 steps down would be row 6 (3+3=6). So that would create copies at (3,4) and (6,1). But in the output, there's also a 3 at (6,4). Which could be the combination of moving down 3 and right 3. So maybe each cell (x,y) with value v adds copies at (x + v, y), (x - v, y), (x, y + v), (x, y - v), and diagonals (x +v, y +v), etc. For v=3, that would generate positions (6,1), (0,1), (3,4), (3,-2), (6,4), (0,-2), etc. But since the grid is 10x10, some of these are out of bounds, but in Example 1's output, there are 3s at (3,4), (6,1), and (6,4). That would fit if the valid positions are (3,4), (6,1), and (6,4) (assuming diagonal movement is allowed). However, the output also has 3s in row 3, column 4 and row 6, column 4, and row 6, column 1. So that might be the case.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 0, the 7 in the input would generate positions (3+7=10, which is out of bounds), so maybe the maximum is row or column 9. But this approach might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by placing the number in all cells that are at a Manhattan distance equal to the number's value from the original cell. For example, for a cell with value v, all cells at Manhattan distance v from (x,y) are set to v. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1's cell (3,1) with v=3. Manhattan distance 3 means all cells where |x -3| + |y -1| = 3. Possible cells:\n\n(0,1) \u2192 3+0=3 \u2192 yes.\n\n(1,0), (1,2) \u2192 |2| + |0| =2, |2| + |1|=3 \u2192 no.\n\n(2,0), (2,2) \u2192 1 +1=2, 1 +1=2.\n\n(3, -2) \u2192 invalid.\n\n(3,4) \u2192 0 +3=3 \u2192 yes.\n\n(4,0), (4,2) \u2192 1 +1=2.\n\n(5,1) \u2192 2 +0=2.\n\n(6,1) \u2192 3 +0=3 \u2192 yes.\n\n(3-3=0,1) \u2192 (0,1) as above.\n\nSo the cells at Manhattan distance 3 would be (0,1), (3,4), (6,1), (3, -2) (invalid), and (3,4). Wait, but (3,4) is already counted. So the valid cells are (0,1), (3,4), (6,1). But in the output of Example 1, there's a 3 at (3,4), (6,1), and (6,4). Hmm, (6,4) has Manhattan distance |6-3| + |4-1|=3+3=6, which is more than 3. So this theory doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's Chebyshev distance (max of x and y distances). For v=3, cells where max(|x -3|, |y -1|) =3. That would include:\n\nx ranges from 0 to6, y ranges from -2 to4.\n\nValid cells: (0,1), (6,1), (3,4), (3,-2), (0,4), (6,4), (0,-2), (6,-2), etc. But in the output, we see 3s at (3,4), (6,1), and (6,4). So (6,4) would be max(3,3)=3, which fits. (3,4) is max(0,3)=3. (6,1) is max(3,0)=3. So those cells would be filled. Then (0,1) is also valid, but in the output, there's no 3 there. So maybe this is part of the pattern, but some cells are overwritten by other numbers.\n\nBut why doesn't the output have a 3 at (0,1)? Maybe because other cells are overwriting it. For example, in Example 1's input, there's a 6 in row4, columns 2 and3. If the 6s also generate their own patterns, perhaps they overwrite the 3s in some cells.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's try to apply this to the test input.\n\nThe test input has a 2 at row 2, column4 (assuming 0-based), and 3s around it. For example, row3 has [0,3,3,3,2,3,0,0,0,0]. So the 3s are at (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,5), etc. \n\nIf the pattern is to place numbers in the output at Chebyshev distance equal to the value from the original cell:\n\nFor each 3 in the input, say at (3,1), the Chebyshev distance 3 would be cells where max(|x-3|, |y-1|)=3. Possible cells:\n\nx: 0,6 (since 3-3=0, 3+3=6)\n\ny: -2,4 (since 1-3=-2, 1+3=4)\n\nSo cells like (0,1), (6,1), (3,4), (0,4), (6,4), (0,-2), (6,-2), etc. Some are out of bounds. In the output, these cells would get 3s. But the original 2 at (2,4) would have Chebyshev distance 2. So max(|x-2|, |y-4|)=2. Possible cells: (0,4), (4,4), (2,6), (2,2), etc.\n\nBut perhaps the output combines all these cells. However, the test input's output would need to have these positions filled with 2s and 3s according to the pattern.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Let's look back at the training examples to find a common rule.\n\nExample 0's input has 4s and 7s. The output has more 4s and 7s arranged in a diamond shape. For example, the 7s are in the center, and the 4s are in a diamond around them. The output's 4s are in positions that are two steps away diagonally from the 7s. The 7s in the output are in a horizontal line, perhaps mirroring the vertical line in the input.\n\nExample 1's input has 3s and 6s. The output has 3s mirrored in certain positions and 6s expanded. The 3s are placed at (3,4), (6,1), and (6,4), which could be the result of mirroring the original 3 across vertical and horizontal axes. The 6s form a larger cluster.\n\nExample 2's input has 9s and 8s. The output mirrors the 9s to the left and bottom. The 8s remain the same, but the 9s are mirrored.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is: for each non-zero cell in the input, the output places copies of that number mirrored across both the vertical and horizontal axes of the grid. The mirrored positions are (9 - x, y) and (x, 9 - y), and (9 - x, 9 - y). But how does this apply to Example 0?\n\nLet's take the 7 in Example 0's input at (3,4). Mirroring vertically would give (3,5) (since 9-4-1=4? Wait, maybe the vertical mirroring is over the central column (4.5), so for a cell at column y, the mirror is at column 9 - y. For example, column 4 becomes 5 (9-4=5). So the cell (3,4) would mirror to (3,5). But in the output, there's a 7 at (3,4) and (5,4). Hmm, maybe horizontal mirroring over the central row (4.5), so row x mirrors to row 9 - x. So (3,4) mirrors to (6,4). But in Example 0's output, there's a 7 at row5, columns3 and5. This is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each non-zero cell (x,y) with value v adds four cells: (x, y), (x, 9-y), (9-x, y), and (9-x,9-y). So for Example 2's input cell (2,6) with value 9, the mirrored cells are (2,3), (7,6), and (7,3). But the output has 9s at (2,2) and (6,6). Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. For a 10x10 grid, indexes 0-9, the mirror of x is 9 - x. So cell (2,6) mirrors to (7,3) (9-2=7, 9-6=3). But in the output, the 9s are at (2,2) and (6,6). So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the mirroring is done over the vertical and horizontal center lines. The vertical center line is between columns 4 and5, and the horizontal between rows4 and5. So for a cell at (x,y), the mirrored positions are (x, 9 - y) for vertical, (9 - x, y) for horizontal, and (9 -x,9 -y) for both. Let's see Example 2's cell (2,6):\n\n- Vertical mirror: column 3 (since 9 -6=3 \u2192 column 3). So (2,3).\n\n- Horizontal mirror: row 7 (9 -2=7). So (7,6).\n\n- Both mirrors: (7,3).\n\nBut the output has 9s at (2,2) and (6,6). This doesn't match. So maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the output is created by taking each non-zero cell and placing copies in all four diagonal directions, two cells away. For example, for a cell at (x,y), place copies at (x-2,y-2), (x-2,y+2), (x+2,y-2), (x+2,y+2). Let's see Example 0's input cell (3,4) with value7. Adding copies two cells diagonally would create cells (1,2), (1,6), (5,2), (5,6). But in the output, there are 4s in some of these positions. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero cell in the input generates a cross shape in the output, with arms of length equal to the cell's value. For example, a 7 would generate a cross with arms 7 cells long, but that's impossible in the grid. So perhaps it's a fixed length.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by applying a convolution or some kernel that spreads the numbers out. For example, each number is replaced by a 3x3 kernel with the number in the center and another number around it. But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0, the input's 7s are surrounded by 4s, and the output's 4s are surrounded by 7s. Maybe the numbers alternate between 7 and 4 in layers. Similarly, in Example 1, the input has 3 and 6, and the output has 3s and 6s in a pattern that alternates. So perhaps the transformation is that each number is replaced by another number (e.g., 7\u21924 and 4\u21927), and this is done in a certain pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput has 7s in the middle surrounded by 4s. Output has 4s where the 7s were and 7s around them. But no, in the output, the original 7s are still present. So maybe not a simple swap.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are part of a pattern where each layer outward changes value. For example, 7 in the center, 4 around, then 7 again. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nLooking for another approach: let's look at the positions of the new numbers in the output compared to the input.\n\nExample 0's input has a vertical line of 7s. The output has a horizontal line of 7s. So perhaps the transformation is rotating the pattern 90 degrees and changing some numbers. But the numbers aren't the same; in the output, 4s are also present.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the input's transpose. Transposing would swap rows and columns, but again, the numbers are not the same.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is a combination of the input and its mirrored versions. For example, the input is mirrored left-right and top-bottom, and combined with the original. But how does this create new numbers?\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero cell in the input generates a diamond-shaped pattern in the output. For instance, in Example 0, the 7s generate a diamond shape, and the 4s generate a smaller diamond. The diamond size could depend on the number's value.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to be sure. Let's try to find a rule that works for all three training examples and then apply it to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput 7 is at (3,4), (4,4), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), etc. Output has 7s in a horizontal line in row5, columns 2-7. Also, 4s are in a diamond shape around them.\n\nExample 1's input 3 at (3,1) and output 3s at (3,4), (6,1), (6,4).\n\nExample 2's input 9 at (2,6) and output 9s at (2,2) and (6,6).\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that for each non-zero cell (x,y) with value v, the output places v at (x, y), (x, center + (center - y)), (center + (center -x), y), and (center + (center -x), center + (center - y)), where center is 4.5. For example, for (x,y) = (2,6) in Example 2, the mirrored positions would be (2, 3), (7,6), and (7,3). But the output has 9s at (2,2) and (6,6). So maybe the mirroring is different.\n\nAlternatively, the mirroring is such that each cell (x,y) is mirrored across the center point (4.5,4.5). The mirrored position would be (9 -x, 9 -y). For Example 2's (2,6), mirrored position is (7,3). But the output has (2,2) and (6,6). Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the mirroring is across the vertical and horizontal axes individually. For example, vertical mirroring would be (x, 9 -y), and horizontal mirroring is (9 -x, y). So for each non-zero cell, the output adds the cell itself plus its vertical, horizontal, and both mirrors. Let's check Example 2's (2,6):\n\n- Vertical mirror: (2, 3) (since 9-6=3)\n\n- Horizontal mirror: (7,6) (9-2=7)\n\n- Both mirrors: (7,3)\n\nBut in the output, there are 9s at (2,2) and (6,6). So that doesn't fit. Unless there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, 9 -6 is 3, but the output's 9s are at (2,2) and (6,6). So maybe the mirroring is not across the entire grid but around the central cell. For example, if the central cell is (4,4), then the mirror of (x,y) is (8 -x, 8 -y). Let's try:\n\nFor Example 2's (2,6):\n\n8 -x =6 \u2192 row 6\n\n8 -y=2 \u2192 column 2\n\nSo mirrored position is (6,2). But the output has (2,2) and (6,6). Hmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, the mirroring is such that the original cell is reflected across the center cell (4.5,4.5), leading to positions (9 -x -1, 9 -y -1) = (8 -x, 8 -y). For (2,6), this would be (6, 2). The output has a 9 at (2,2) and (6,6). So not matching.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's think differently. Maybe each non-zero cell in the input is generating a pattern based on the number's parity or some other property. For example, even numbers expand horizontally, odd numbers expand vertically. But Example 0's 7 (odd) expands horizontally in the output, which contradicts.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the sum of the numbers. For Example 0's input, there are 4 7s and 4 4s. The output has more numbers, but the sum increases. However, this doesn't help in finding the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by replacing each non-zero cell in the input with a certain pattern. For example, a 7 might become a cross of 7s and 4s. But this is too vague.\n\nLet me try to find a common transformation between the inputs and outputs.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput row 4: [0,0,0,4,7,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row 4: [0,0,0,4,7,4,0,0,0,0] (same as input)\n\nOutput row 5: [0,0,7,7,4,7,7,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 7s in row5 are added to columns 2,3,5,6. This could be expanding the 7s from the input's row4 (which has a 7) into adjacent rows, but with some pattern. Or perhaps the 4s in the input's row4 (columns 3 and5) generate 7s in the output.\n\nExample 1's input row3 has a 3 at column1. Output row3 has 3s at columns1,4, and row6, columns1,4.\n\nThis seems like the 3 is generating copies in positions that are 3 cells away in some directions. So for (3,1), adding 3 to the row and column gives (6,4) (3+3=6, 1+3=4). And (3,1+3=4) gives (3,4). (3+3=6,1) gives (6,1). So the copies are at (3,4), (6,1), and (6,4). This matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern might be: For each non-zero cell with value v at (x,y), generate new cells at:\n\n- (x + v, y)\n\n- (x - v, y)\n\n- (x, y + v)\n\n- (x, y - v)\n\n- (x + v, y + v)\n\n- (x + v, y - v)\n\n- (x - v, y + v)\n\n- (x - v, y - v)\n\nBut only if within the grid bounds.\n\nLet's test this for Example 1's 3 at (3,1):\n\nv=3:\n\n(x + v, y) \u2192 (6,1)\n\n(x -v, y) \u2192 (0,1) (valid)\n\n(x, y +v) \u2192 (3,4)\n\n(x, y -v) \u2192 (3,-2) (invalid)\n\n(x +v, y +v) \u2192 (6,4)\n\n(x +v, y -v) \u2192 (6,-2) (invalid)\n\n(x -v, y +v) \u2192 (0,4)\n\n(x -v, y -v) \u2192 (0,-2) (invalid)\n\nSo the valid positions are (6,1), (0,1), (3,4), (6,4), (0,4). In the output, we see 3s at (3,4), (6,1), (6,4). The others might be overwritten by other numbers or not present because of other cells. For example, the input also has 6s which may generate their own numbers.\n\nBut the output of Example1 has 3s at (3,4), (6,1), (6,4), and (3,4) is already covered. The other positions (0,1) and (0,4) are not present in the output, possibly because they're out of bounds or not shown.\n\nIf this is the case, then applying this rule to the test input would involve generating copies based on each cell's value.\n\nTest input has a 2 at (2,4) and 3s around it. Let's take the 3 at (3,1) in the test input. Applying v=3:\n\nNew positions would be (6,1), (0,1), (3,4), (6,4), etc. Similarly, for the 3s at (3,2), (3,3), (3,5), etc., each would generate their own copies. The 2 at (2,4) would generate positions:\n\n(x +2, y) \u2192 (4,4)\n\n(x -2, y) \u2192 (0,4)\n\n(x, y+2) \u2192 (2,6)\n\n(x, y-2) \u2192 (2,2)\n\n(x+2, y+2) \u2192 (4,6)\n\n(x+2, y-2) \u2192 (4,2)\n\n(x-2, y+2) \u2192 (0,6)\n\n(x-2, y-2) \u2192 (0,2)\n\nSo these positions would have 2s. But the output also has 3s, so the numbers would overlap. But according to the training examples, when numbers overlap, they are overwritten? Or maybe the highest number takes precedence, or they are summed. But in the training examples, overlapping cells have only one number. For example, in Example 0's output, the center has 7s and 4s but they are arranged such that they don't overlap.\n\nAlternatively, each cell in the output is the maximum value of all generated numbers in that position.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFor each 3 in the input, generate copies in the positions described. For example, the 3 at (3,1) would generate 3s at (6,1), (3,4), (6,4). The 3 at (3,2) would generate 3s at (6,2), (3,5), (6,5). Etc. The 2 at (2,4) would generate 2s at (4,4), (0,4), (2,6), (2,2), etc.\n\nSo the output would have 3s and 2s in various positions. However, the actual test output is not provided, so I need to apply the pattern as per the training examples.\n\nBut how to format this into the output grid.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each non-zero cell in the input places copies of its value in all cells that are v steps away in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) and four diagonal directions. \n\nFor the test input's 2 at (2,4), this would mean placing 2s at (2+2,4)=(4,4), (2-2,4)=(0,4), (2,4+2)=(2,6), (2,4-2)=(2,2), and diagonally (4,6), (4,2), (0,6), (0,2). These positions would have 2s. Similarly, each 3 in the input would generate 3s in positions 3 steps away.\n\nBut in the training examples, for Example 0's 7s, this would place 7s 7 steps away, which is outside the grid. So perhaps this is not the case.\n\nAnother possibility: each non-zero cell (x,y) with value v adds v to the same cell in the output, and then creates a cross shape in the output with v at positions (x \u00b11, y), (x, y \u00b11), and (x \u00b11, y \u00b11). But in Example 0, the output has 4s and 7s arranged around the input's numbers.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by placing each non-zero cell's value in all cells adjacent to it (including diagonally), but changing the value according to some rule. For example, every adjacent cell gets a value that is the original cell's value minus 3, but this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to synthesize a possible rule based on the examples:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the original 7s in the input have 4s around them in a diamond pattern, and those 4s have 7s around them. This suggests an alternating pattern of 7s and 4s expanding outward.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 3s are placed in positions that form a diamond around the original 3, and the 6s form a larger cluster.\n\nIn Example 2's output, the 9s are mirrored across both axes.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern might be that each non-zero number in the input is placed in the output at its original position and mirrored across both the vertical and horizontal axes of the grid. This would explain the symmetry seen in the outputs.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFor each non-zero cell (x,y) with value v, create mirrored cells at (x,9-y), (9-x,y), and (9-x,9-y).\n\nLet's apply this to the test input's 3 at (3,1):\n\n- Original: (3,1)\n\n- Vertical mirror: (3,8) (9-1-1=7? Or 9-y? For y=1, 9-1=8. So column 8.\n\n- Horizontal mirror: (6,1) (9-3=6).\n\n- Both mirrors: (6,8).\n\nBut in the output, where would these 3s appear? For example, the original 3 at (3,1) would have mirrored 3s at (3,8), (6,1), (6,8). Let's check if this fits any of the training examples.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 3 at (3,1) leads to 3s at (3,4) in the output. Wait, this doesn't fit the mirroring idea. So perhaps this isn't the correct rule.\n\nAlternatively, the mirroring is across the central vertical and horizontal lines, which for a 10x10 grid would be between columns 4 and5 and rows4 and5. So the mirrored positions are:\n\nVertical mirror: (x, 9 - y)\n\nHorizontal mirror: (9 - x, y)\n\nBoth mirrors: (9 -x, 9 -y)\n\nFor Example 1's 3 at (3,1):\n\n- Vertical mirror: (3, 8 -1)= (3,7)\n\n- Horizontal mirror: (9-3=6,1)\n\n- Both mirrors: (6,7)\n\nBut the output has 3s at (3,4), (6,1), (6,4). These don't match. So this approach isn't working.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is to mirror each non-zero cell across the center of the grid, which would be position (4.5,4.5). So for a cell at (x,y), the mirrored position is (9 -x,9 -y). For Example 2's cell (2,6):\n\nMirrored position is (7,3). But the output has (2,2) and (6,6). So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the examples. The pattern seems to be that each non-zero cell in the input is mirrored across both the vertical and horizontal axes, creating a symmetrical pattern in the output. For example, a cell at (x,y) is mirrored to (x,9-y), (9-x,y), and (9-x,9-y). However, in the training examples, this doesn't fully explain the positions, but maybe there's an exception for certain values.\n\nFor the test input, let's apply this mirroring. The input has a 2 at (2,4). Mirroring it vertically would be (2,5), horizontally (7,4), and both (7,5). Similarly, the 3s in the input would be mirrored. But how does this create the output's numbers?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by creating a diamond shape around each non-zero cell. For instance, each cell (x,y) with value v creates a diamond with radius v. For v=2, the diamond would include cells at Manhattan distance 2 from (x,y).\n\nApplying this to the test input's 2 at (2,4), the Manhattan distance 2 cells would form a diamond around it. The 3s in the input would have diamonds of radius 3.\n\nBut again, this is speculative. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to apply the mirroring pattern as the likely rule and generate the test output accordingly.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples, then apply that pattern to the test input. Let me start by analyzing each training example one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nIn the input, the main non-zero numbers are a 7 in the middle (row 3, column 4), surrounded by 4s and 7s in a sort of cross pattern. The output seems to expand that. For instance, the 7 in the middle row (row 3) now has 4s on either side in the same row. Also, looking at the vertical line, the 7 in row 4, column 4 (input) is part of a cross that becomes more spread out. Wait, maybe the output is mirroring or extending the numbers in certain directions.\n\nWait, in the input of Example 0, the center is 7 at (3,4). Then, the output adds 4s around it. Like, in row 3 of the output, there's a 4 at (3,2) and (3,6), which are two columns away from the center. Also, in row 5 of the output, there's 7s in columns 2 and 6. Hmm. Maybe there's a diamond-shaped pattern or something where each number is replicated at a certain distance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is creating a symmetrical pattern based on the original numbers. For example, in the input, there's a 4 at (4,3), which in the output seems to generate 4s in other positions. Maybe each number is being copied to adjacent cells in a specific way, but not just adjacent. Let's look at the positions.\n\nOriginal input for Example 0:\nThe 7 is at (3,4) and (5,3) in the input? Wait, looking at the input rows:\n\nRow 3 (0-indexed?) Let's assume rows are 0-9. So row 3 is the fourth line. Let's index rows and columns from 0. So input row 3 (fourth line) is [0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0]. Then rows 4,5,6 have patterns with 4 and 7. The output for row 3 in Example 0 becomes [0,0,4,0,7,0,4,0,0,0]. So the 4s are two columns away from the 7. Then row 5 in the output is [0,0,7,7,4,7,7,0,0,0], which seems like a horizontal line of 7s around the 4. So perhaps each original number is generating a cross shape with copies in four directions, but the distance depends on the number's value.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 7 is in the middle. The output has 4s and 7s in a diamond pattern. Let me check if the numbers in the output are related to the original numbers. For instance, 4 and 7. Maybe 7 is the center, and 4 is placed at a certain distance. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are being placed at a distance equal to their value. Wait, 4 and 7: 4 could be steps away. But 4 steps from 7's position would go out of bounds. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero number in the input is being used to place copies of itself or another number at positions offset by a certain amount. For example, in Example 1's input, the 3 at (3,1) in the input leads to 3s in certain positions in the output. Let's check Example 1's input and output.\n\nExample 1's input has a 3 at (3,1). The output for row 3 has 3 at (3,1), (3,4), and (6,4). Wait, in the output, row 3 is [0,3,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 3 is at columns 1 and 4. Maybe the 3 is generating copies two steps to the right (column 1 +3 would be 4? Not sure). Then in the output's row 6, there's a 3 at (6,0) and (6,4). Not sure. Alternatively, maybe each non-zero number in the input causes certain numbers to be placed in the output at positions that form a cross, with the original number and some other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of all the original numbers plus their mirrored positions. For instance, in Example 0's input, the 7 is at (3,4). The output has 4s two steps left and right. Maybe each non-zero number in the input is replaced by a cross shape where the arms are of length equal to the number's value. Wait, 7 is a larger number. But in Example 0, the 7 in the input is part of a cross that's expanding. But in the output, the 7s are in row 5, columns 2 and 6. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe each number is being duplicated in four directions (up, down, left, right) at a distance equal to their value. But 7 would mean moving 7 steps, which is outside the grid. So maybe the numbers are steps, but modulo some value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each non-zero number in the input grid is transformed into a diamond pattern in the output, where the diamond's size is based on the number. For example, in Example 0's output, the 7s form a diamond, and 4s are around. Wait, perhaps each non-zero number in the input is creating a diamond shape with that number and another number (like 4 and 7 in Example 0) in the output.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the numbers in Example 0's input: the input has 4,7,4 in rows 4 and 5. The output has those plus more 4s and 7s arranged in a cross. Maybe it's a matter of taking each cell in the input and, for each non-zero, adding numbers around it in certain directions.\n\nAnother approach: compare each input and output cell. For each cell in the output, see if it's a sum or some operation of neighboring cells in the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a convolution. For example, applying a kernel where each cell is replaced by a combination of its neighbors. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input has a 3 at (3,1), and 6s in rows 4 and 5. The output has 3s at (3,1), (3,4), (6,1), (6,4), and 6s spread around. So maybe the 3 is creating a cross-shaped pattern with 3s at a certain distance. The 6s in the input are arranged in a 2x2 block, and the output has 6s forming a cross around them. For instance, in the output's row 4, the 6s are columns 2,3,4, forming a horizontal line. In row 5, the 6s are columns 1,2,3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that each non-zero number in the input creates a cross in the output where the arms are of length equal to the number. But in Example 0, the 7 in the input is at (3,4). If the arms are of length 7, that's way beyond the grid. So maybe not. But perhaps the number is split into digits. 7 could be 7 steps, but that's impossible. Alternatively, maybe the number indicates how many steps to place a copy. For example, 4 could mean placing copies 4 cells away. But again, for 7, that's outside.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input and output. The input has 9 at (2,6), and 8s in a 3x3 block. The output adds 9s at (2,2) and (2,6), and also at (6,2) and (6,6). So it's like mirroring the 9s diagonally. The 8s remain in the same place, but the 9s are placed in a diamond pattern. So the 9 in the input is at (2,6), and in the output, there's a 9 at (2,2) and (6,6), and also (6,2) perhaps. Wait, the output for row 2 is [0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0]. So the 9s are at columns 2 and 6. Then row 6 has 9s at columns 2 and 6. So the original 9 at (2,6) is mirrored to (2,2) and (6,6), perhaps. But how?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each non-zero cell in the input, the output places copies of that number at positions that are symmetric relative to the center of the grid. But the grid is 10x10, so the center is between (4.5,4.5). For example, a cell at (3,1) would be mirrored to (6, 8) if mirrored across the center. But in Example 1's output, the 3 is at (3,1) and (3,4), (6,1), (6,4). Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's mirrored along vertical and horizontal axes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero cell in the input generates four copies in the output: up, down, left, and right by a certain number of cells. For example, in Example 0's 7, which is at (3,4), perhaps placing a 4 two cells to the left and right. Then the 4s in the input generate their own copies. But how do the numbers relate?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be creating a kind of reflection or rotation. For example, in Example 0, the input has a vertical line of 4,7,4 in rows 4,5,6. The output seems to create a diamond shape around that. Maybe the output is a combination of the original pattern and its rotations.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 2's input. The input has a 9 at (2,6) and three rows of 8s. The output has 9s at (2,2), (2,6), (6,2), (6,6). So the 9 in (2,6) is mirrored to (2,2), (6,6), and (6,2). That's like mirroring across both the vertical and horizontal axes. So, if the original position is (row, col), then mirrored positions are (row, 9 - col), (9 - row, col), (9 - row, 9 - col). But since the grid is 10x10 (indices 0-9), 9 - col would be the mirror. For example, (2,6) mirrored across vertical axis would be (2,3) since 9-6=3. But in the output, it's (2,2) and (2,6). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the original 9 is at (2,6) in the input. The output adds another 9 at (2,2) (6 units left?), which is 6-2=4 steps left. Wait, 6 to 2 is a distance of 4. So maybe the number 9 causes a copy 9 mod something steps away. 9 mod 4 would be 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generating a cross for each non-zero cell, where the cross has a certain length. For example, a cell with value N creates a horizontal and vertical line of length N in the output. But N=7 would create a long line. However, looking at Example 0's 7 in row 3, column 4: in the output, it's surrounded by 4s two steps away. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers in the output are a combination of the original numbers and their neighbors. For example, each cell in the output is the maximum of the original cell and some of its neighbors. But the outputs in the examples have new numbers that weren't present in the input. Like Example 0's output has 4s where the input had 4s and 7s, but also new 4s and 7s.\n\nWait, another observation: in Example 0's input, the middle has a 7. The output has 4s around it. The 4s in the input (like row 4, column 3) are transformed into 4s in the output, but also generate 7s. Maybe there's a relationship between 4 and 7. For example, 4 + 3 =7. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: the 3 and 6s. The output has 3s and 6s. The 3 in the input leads to 3s in the output, and the 6s in the input lead to more 6s. So perhaps each number in the input is placed in the output and also some transformation based on neighbors.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is the result of applying a certain number of cellular automaton steps. But the examples don't seem to align with common rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero cell in the input is the center of a diamond-shaped region in the output. For example, a cell with value N creates a diamond of radius N in the output. But how?\n\nLet's take Example 0's input. The 7 in (3,4) could create a diamond of radius 7, but that would be too large. Alternatively, perhaps the value determines the distance. For example, 4 and 7 could be distances. But in the output, the 7 is surrounded by 4s two steps away. Maybe the distance is related to the difference between the numbers. 7-4=3. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has a 9 and three rows of 8s. The output adds 9s in positions (2,2), (2,6), (6,2), (6,6). So the original 9 is at (2,6), and the new ones are at (2,2) (4 steps left), (6,6) (4 steps down and same column?), and (6,2) (4 steps down and 4 left). Hmm. So maybe for each non-zero cell, you mirror it in four quadrants. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the input and its transposed or rotated version. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number in the input is replaced by a cross in the output where the cross's arms are of length equal to the number. For example, a 3 would create a cross with arms of length 3. Let's check Example 1. The 3 in (3,1) would create a cross of 3s in all directions. But in the output, the 3s are at (3,1), (3,4), (6,1), (6,4). Wait, the distance from (3,1) to (3,4) is 3 columns. So if the arm length is 3, then yes. So the horizontal arm would go from column 1 to 4 (distance 3 to the right) and maybe to the left, but since column 1-3 is 0, maybe it's only to the right. Then vertical arms would be up and down. But in Example 1's output, the 3 at (3,1) also has a 3 at (3,4), which is 3 columns away. Then in row 6 (3 rows down from row 3), which is 3 steps down, there's a 3 at column 1 and 4. So that would be vertical arm length 3. So the cross for the 3 in (3,1) has horizontal arms of 3 steps left and right, and vertical arms of 3 steps up and down. But in the input's 3 at (3,1), the output has 3s at (3,1) (original), (3,4) (right 3 steps), (6,1) (down 3 steps), (6,4) (down 3 and right 3). And maybe also up and left, but those would be out of bounds (row 0 or negative columns). So that makes sense. Then the 6s in the input would create crosses of length 6. Let's check Example 1's input has 6s at (4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (5,3). So each 6 would generate crosses of length 6. But 6 steps in any direction would go beyond the grid. But in the output, the 6s are spread in a cross. For example, in row 4 of the output, the 6s are at columns 2,3,4. So that's a horizontal cross of length 6 centered at (4,3). But since the grid is only 10 columns, maybe the cross is truncated. So the horizontal arm would be from column 3-6 to 3+6, but that's beyond the grid. So in the output, it's columns 2,3,4. Maybe it's taking the maximum possible.\n\nIf this is the case, then the pattern is: for each non-zero cell in the input, in the output, create a cross (horizontal and vertical lines) centered at that cell, with length equal to the cell's value. The cross is filled with the same number as the original cell, but overlapping cells may take higher values or sum. But looking at Example 0's output, the original 7 is in the center, and there are 4s around. So maybe when crosses overlap, a different value is used. Alternatively, perhaps the cross is filled with a different number. For example, the cross length is determined by the value, but the numbers in the cross are a function of the original number, like original number minus 3. So 7 would create a cross of 4s. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 7 at (3,4) would generate a cross of length 7. But 7 steps in each direction would go beyond the grid, so it's truncated. The horizontal cross would go from column 4-7 to 4+7, but since the maximum column is 9, it's from 0 to 9. But in the output for row 3, columns 2,4,6 have 4,7,4. Wait, perhaps the cross's length is divided by 2. For example, the 7's cross would have arms of 7/2=3.5 steps. But that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the cross uses the original number as the value. For example, the 7's cross would be filled with 7s. But in Example 0's output, the 7 is surrounded by 4s, which might come from other cells. So maybe overlapping crosses from different numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross uses a different number based on the original. Like 4 and 7 in Example 0: maybe the 4s in the input create crosses of 4s, and the 7 creates crosses of 7s, and where they overlap, the higher number is taken. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 4 has 4 at (4,3). So a cross of length 4 centered at (4,3). The horizontal arm would go from column 3-4= -1 (so 0) to 3+4=7. So columns 0 to 7 in row 4. But the output's row 4 has 4s at columns 3,4,5. Hmm, maybe the cross is not the full length. Alternatively, the cross is in the output for each cell, but only up to the grid's edges.\n\nAlternatively, this approach is getting too complicated. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's output, the 4s and 7s form a diamond pattern. The same happens in Example 2's output with 9s. Maybe each non-zero cell in the input generates a diamond-shaped area in the output, where the diamond's size is determined by the cell's value. The diamond could be a square rotated 45 degrees, with the Manhattan distance from the center not exceeding the value. For example, a value of 4 would create a diamond where each cell is at most 4 steps away (Manhattan distance) from the center. Then, in the output, those cells are filled with the same number. If multiple diamonds overlap, perhaps the numbers are summed or the maximum is taken.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's input. The 7 at (3,4) would generate a diamond with Manhattan distance 7. But the grid is 10x10, so that diamond would cover a large area. The output for Example 0 has 7s in a cross. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the diamond's size is the value divided by 2. For example, 7 would have a diamond with radius 3 (floor(7/2)), which would cover a diamond of Manhattan distance 3 from the center. Let's see. For the 7 in (3,4), the diamond would include cells where |row -3| + |col -4| \u22643. That would create a diamond shape. But in Example 0's output, the 7s are in a cross pattern. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the number determines the number of steps in each direction. For example, a 4 would create a cross with arms of length 4. But again, the output for Example 0 has 4s two steps away from the 7.\n\nAlternatively, the number is the distance between the original cell and the new cells. For example, a 4 in the input causes new cells to be placed 4 units away. But for 4 in row 4, column 3 of Example 0's input, placing cells 4 units away would be row 4-4=0, row 4+4=8, column 3-4=-1, column 3+4=7. But in the output, there's a 4 at row 3, column 2 (1 step up and left). So that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that each non-zero cell in the input is replaced by a cross in the output where the cross has a certain pattern. For example, for a cell with value N:\n\n- Place N in the original position.\n- Place N-3 to the left, right, up, and down by 1 cell.\n- Or some other pattern.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to find a different approach.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe test input has a 2 at (2,4) (third row, fifth column). Then in row 3, there's 3s around it. Then in rows 3,4,5, there's a pattern of 3s and 2s. The output needs to follow the same pattern as the training examples.\n\nAssuming that the pattern is that each non-zero cell in the input generates a cross in the output with arms of length equal to the cell's value, and filled with the cell's value. For example, a 2 would generate a cross two cells in each direction. But let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 7 would generate a cross of 7s seven cells in each direction, but since the grid is limited, it's truncated. But the output has 4s and 7s. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the cross's arms are the value of the cell, but filled with the cell's value minus 3. So a 7 becomes 4, a 3 becomes 0 (but in Example 1's output, the 3 is present). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the cross is filled with the original value, and overlapping crosses from different numbers use the sum. But this would require multiple passes. For example, in Example 0's input, the 4s and 7s generate crosses that overlap, creating higher numbers where they intersect. But the output has 7s and 4s, not sums. So maybe not.\n\nAnother idea: in Example 0's output, the 7 from the input is still present in the same position. The 4s around it are from the 4s in the input. The input's 4s are in rows 4,5,6. Their positions are (4,3), (4,5), (5,4), etc. In the output, these 4s generate crosses. For example, the 4 at (4,3) would generate a cross of 4s four cells in each direction. But the output's 4s are at (3,2), (3,6), etc. Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the 4s are placed two cells away from the 7s. For example, in row 3, columns 2 and 6 have 4s, two cells left and right of the 7. Similarly, in row 5, columns 2 and 6 have 7s. This seems like a diamond pattern. So maybe the pattern is that each non-zero cell generates a diamond where the distance from the center is the cell's value divided by 2. For instance, a value of 4 would create a diamond with radius 2 (4/2), and a value of 7 would create a radius of 3.5 (rounded down to 3). So the 7 in Example 0's input creates a diamond with radius 3, and the 4 creates a radius of 2. Then, in the output, these diamonds are filled with the same number as the original cell.\n\nLet's check Example 0. The 7 at (3,4) would generate a diamond where Manhattan distance \u22643. This diamond would include cells like (0,4), (3,7), (6,4), etc. But in the output, the 7 is still at (3,4), and there are 4s at (3,2) and (3,6), which are two cells away. So maybe the 7's diamond is filled with 7s, but overlapping with the 4's diamonds. But in the output, there are 4s where the 4's diamonds overlap with the 7's. So perhaps when two diamonds overlap, the higher value takes precedence. For example, if a cell is in both a 7's diamond and a 4's diamond, the 7 is used. This would explain why in Example 0's output, the center is 7 and surrounding are 4s.\n\nBut how do the 4s get there? The input has 4s in rows 4,5,6. For example, the 4 at (4,3) would generate a diamond with radius 2. This diamond would include cells from (4-2,3) to (4+2,3), and similarly for columns. So that would be rows 2-6 and columns 1-5 (since 3-2=1, 3+2=5). So in row 3, column 2 is part of this diamond (distance from (4,3) is 1 row up and 1 column left: total Manhattan distance 2). So that cell would get a 4. Similarly, the 4 at (4,5) would generate a diamond that covers row 3, column 6. So overlapping diamonds from multiple 4s would fill those positions with 4s, and the 7's diamond would have 7s in the center. But in the output, the 7s are only in the central cross, and the 4s are around. This seems plausible.\n\nApplying this to Example 2's input, which has a 9 at (2,6). The diamond radius would be 9/2=4.5, so 4. This would cover cells from (2-4,6) to (2+4,6) in rows and columns 6-4=2 to 6+4=10 (but column 9 is the max). So the diamond would include rows -2 (which is 0) to 6, and columns 2 to 10 (but columns up to 9). The 9's diamond would thus cover a large area. But in the output, the 9s are at (2,2), (2,6), (6,2), (6,6). These positions are Manhattan distance 4 from (2,6) (for (2,2): |2-2| + |6-2|=4; for (6,6): |2-6| + |6-6|=4; etc.). So the diamond for the 9 would have radius 4, which includes all cells with Manhattan distance \u22644. But in the output, only the corners of the diamond are filled with 9s. This doesn't fit the diamond theory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by placing the original number at positions offset by the number's value in each diagonal direction. For example, a 9 at (2,6) would place 9s at (2\u00b19,6\u00b19), but since the grid is limited, only those within bounds are placed. But 2+9=11 (which is beyond row 9), so this wouldn't work. Alternatively, modulo 10. For example, 2+9=11 mod 10 is 1, but that doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each non-zero cell in the input places copies of its value in the output at positions that are mirror images across the vertical and horizontal midlines of the grid. For a 10x10 grid, the midlines are between rows 4 and 5 and columns 4 and 5. For example, the cell at (3,4) would have a mirror at (5,4) and (3,5), and (5,5). But in Example 0's input, the 7 is at (3,4). The output has 7s at (5,4) and other positions. This could be a reflection. Let's check:\n\nOriginal position (3,4). The vertical mirror would be row 6 (since 3 mirrored over the vertical midline (between rows 4.5) would be 6: 3's mirror is 6, as 4.5 - (3-4.5) =6). Similarly, the horizontal mirror of column 4 is column 5. So the mirror positions would be (6,4), (3,5), (6,5). But in the output, the 7 is still at (3,4), and there's a 7 at (5,4). Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to mirror each non-zero cell across the center of the grid. The center is at (4.5,4.5). For example, a cell at (3,4) would have a mirror at (6,5) (since 3 + (5.5 -3) *2 =6.5? Not sure. This approach is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that each non-zero cell in the input is expanded into a plus sign (+) in the output, with arms length equal to the cell's value. For example, a cell with value 3 would create a plus sign extending 3 cells up, down, left, and right. Let's test this.\n\nExample 1's input has a 3 at (3,1). A plus sign with arms of length 3 would extend from (3,1) up to row 0, down to row 6, left to column -2 (which is invalid), and right to column 4. So the valid parts would be rows 0-6 in column 1 and columns 1-4 in row 3. But the output for Example 1 has 3s at (3,1), (3,4), (6,1), (6,4). This suggests that the horizontal arm is length 3, reaching column 4 (1+3=4), and the vertical arm is down 3 steps to row 6 (3+3=6). So the plus sign for the 3 would have 3s along row 3 from column 1 to 4, and along column 1 from row 3 to 6. Additionally, the 3 in row 6, column 1 would generate its own plus sign. But in the output, there's a 3 at (6,4), which is column 4 in row 6. That could be the horizontal arm of the plus sign for the 3 at (6,1), extending 3 columns to the right (1+3=4). This seems to fit. Similarly, the 6s in the input would generate plus signs. For example, a 6 at (4,2) would generate a plus sign with arms length 6. The vertical arm would extend from row 4-6= -2 (invalid) to row 4+6=10 (invalid). So only the valid parts are rows 0-9. But in the output, the 6s are spread in a cross pattern. For example, row 4 has 6s from column 2 to 4. Which is a horizontal arm of length 6, but centered at column 2, so from column 2-6= -4 (invalid) to 2+6=8. The valid part is columns 0-8, but in the output, columns 2,3,4 have 6s. This doesn't fit. So perhaps the arms are truncated to the grid's boundaries.\n\nIf this is the case, then the pattern is: each non-zero cell in the input generates a plus sign in the output, with arms of length equal to the cell's value, filled with the cell's value. If multiple plus signs overlap, the maximum value is taken.\n\nTesting this with Example 0's input: the 7 at (3,4) would generate a plus sign with arms of length 7. The horizontal arm would extend from column 4-7= -3 (0) to 4+7=11 (9), filling columns 0-9 in row 3 with 7s. But in the output, row 3 has 4,0,7,0,4. So this doesn't fit. Therefore, this theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has symmetries that the input lacks. For example, Example 0's input is asymmetric vertically but the output is symmetric. Maybe the output is a combination of the input and its mirror images. For instance, the output is the input plus its reflection across vertical and/or horizontal axes. But Example 0's input has a vertical line of 4,7,4. The output is symmetric in both vertical and horizontal axes. So perhaps the output is the original input plus its mirror images in all four quadrants.\n\nBut how does that explain the numbers? For example, Example 1's input has a 3 at (3,1). The output has 3s at (3,1), (3,4), (6,1), (6,4). Which would be mirroring across the vertical and horizontal midlines. The vertical midline is between columns 4 and 5. So column 1's mirror is column 8 (since 10-1-1=8). But in Example 1's output, the 3 is at column 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the mirroring is done across the center of the grid. For each non-zero cell (r,c), its mirror positions are (9-r,c), (r,9-c), and (9-r,9-c). For example, (3,1) becomes (6,1), (3,8), (6,8). But in Example 1's output, there are 3s at (3,4), (6,4). So perhaps the mirroring is not across the entire grid but around the center point.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero cell is copied to positions that are symmetric in a certain way. For example, in Example 2's input, the 9 is at (2,6). The output has 9s at (2,2) and (6,6), which are symmetric across the center. So, the center is (4.5,4.5). The original cell's position (2,6) is 2.5 units above and 1.5 units to the right of the center. The mirror would be 2.5 units below and 1.5 units to the left, which is (7,3). But the output has a 9 at (6,2), which is (6,2). Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm struggling to find the exact pattern. Let's try to look for a different angle.\n\nLooking at the outputs for all examples:\n\n- The output seems to have a symmetric pattern based on the input's elements.\n\n- The number of non-zero elements increases in the output, suggesting that each non-zero input cell generates multiple cells in the output.\n\n- The numbers in the output are the same as or derived from the input numbers.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 4s are placed in positions that form a diamond around the 7s. For instance, the 4s are two cells away from the 7s. The 7s are in the same positions as the input's 7s. So maybe the rule is: for each non-zero cell with value N, place N in the original position and N-3 in cells two steps away in all four directions (up, down, left, right). But 7-3=4, which matches the 4s around the 7. Similarly, in Example 1's input, the 3s would generate 0s (3-3=0), but the output has 3s and 6s. Wait, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each non-zero cell N in the input, place N in the original position and also at a distance of N/2 steps away. For example, 7/2=3.5, rounded down to 3 steps. So the 7 would generate copies 3 steps away. But this doesn't fit Example 0's output.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are placed at positions that are N mod 5 steps away. But this is too arbitrary.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's input, there's a 4 at (4,3) and (4,5), and a 7 at (3,4), (4,4), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). The output has 4s at (3,2), (3,6), (5,2), (5,6), etc. Maybe each 4 in the input is placed two steps left and right, and the 7s are placed two steps up and down. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the 3s are placed three steps to the right and down. The 3 in (3,1) generates a 3 at (3,4) (3 steps right) and (6,1) (3 steps down). Similarly, the 6s are placed six steps, but since the grid is smaller, they're placed at the edges. So the output's 6s form a cross.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the pattern is: for each non-zero cell with value N in the input, place N in the output at the original position, and also N steps to the right, left, up, and down. If a step goes beyond the grid, it wraps around or is truncated. However, in Example 1, the 3 at (3,1) steps right 3 positions to column 4 (1+3=4) and down 3 steps to row 6 (3+3=6). The 3 steps left would be column 1-3=-2 (invalid), so it's ignored. Similarly, up 3 steps would be row 0. But in the output, there's no 3 at row 0. So perhaps only the right and down steps are considered. Or perhaps the steps are placed in all four directions but only if within bounds.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 3 at (3,1) generates a 3 at (3,4) (right 3 steps) and (6,1) (down 3 steps), and also (3,1-3)= (3,-2) invalid, and (3-3,1)= (0,1). The output has 3s at (3,1), (3,4), (6,1), and (6,4). The last one might be from the down and right steps. For example, moving down 3 and right 3 from (3,1) gives (6,4), which is present in the output. So perhaps each non-zero cell generates four new cells: right N steps, down N steps, right and down N steps, etc. But that's speculative.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 3 at (3,1) also has a 3 at (3,4), (6,1), and (6,4). So that's adding N steps in both x and y directions. So the rule could be: for each non-zero cell (r,c) with value N, the output has cells at (r, c + N), (r + N, c), and (r + N, c + N), if within grid bounds. But let's check:\n\nFor Example 1's 3 at (3,1):\n\n- (3,1+3) = (3,4) valid. Output has 3 there.\n\n- (3+3,1) = (6,1) valid. Output has 3 there.\n\n- (3+3,1+3) = (6,4) valid. Output has 3 there.\n\n- Also, perhaps (r - N, c), (r, c - N), etc., but those would be out of bounds.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the 3 generates three new cells in the output. The output also has 3s at (3,1) (original), and (3,4), (6,1), (6,4). Similarly, the 6s in Example 1's input would generate cells at (4+6, 2) which is (10,2) invalid. But in the output, the 6s are spread in a cross, which may involve other rules.\n\nAlternatively, this approach works for Example 1's 3 but not for others. Let's check Example 0's 7 at (3,4):\n\nApplying the same rule:\n\n- (3,4+7) = (3,11) invalid.\n\n- (3+7,4) = (10,4) invalid.\n\n- (3+7,4+7) = (10,11) invalid.\n\nSo no new cells. But the output has 7s in the same position and 4s around. So this theory doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: in Example 0's output, the 4s are two steps away from the 7. The 7's value is 7. 7-3=4, so maybe the distance is 3 steps. But 3 steps from (3,4) would be (6,4), which is present in the output's row 5, but in Example 0's output, row 5 is [0,0,7,7,4,7,7,0,0,0]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the distance is the value of the cell. So a 7 in the input would generate cells 7 steps away. But that's impossible in a 10x10 grid.\n\nPerhaps the key is to look at the numbers in the input and output. For example, in Example 0's input, the numbers are 4 and 7. In the output, the 7 is surrounded by 4s. Similarly, in Example 1's input, there are 3 and 6. In the output, the 3s are surrounded by 6s. And in Example 2's input, 8 and 9. The output has 8s and 9s arranged around. So maybe each non-zero cell N in the input creates a cross in the output with N and another number (like N+3 or N-3) at certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero cell N in the input is replaced by a cross with arms of length 1, with N-3 in the arms. For example, 7-3=4. So a cross of 4s around the 7. But in Example 1's 3, 3-3=0, but the output has 3 and 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's input, the 7 is surrounded by 4s. 4+3=7. In Example 1's input, 3 and 6: 3+3=6. So perhaps the numbers in the output are the sum of neighboring cells. But this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the output for a cell with value N is N in the center and N-3 in the adjacent cells. But this doesn't explain the patterns.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling to find the pattern, perhaps I should look for commonalities between the examples:\n\n- Each output has symmetry. For example, Example 0's output is symmetric along both the vertical and horizontal axes.\n\n- The non-zero input cells generate patterns in the output that are symmetric.\n\n- The numbers in the output seem to form crosses or diamonds around the input's non-zero cells.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe test input has a 2 at (2,4), and 3s and 2s in a pattern. Applying the pattern from the examples, perhaps each non-zero cell generates a symmetric pattern around it. For example, the 2 in (2,4) would generate copies two steps away. The 3s in the input would generate copies three steps away.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nThe 2 at (2,4) would generate copies two steps in each direction. Assuming the pattern is to place copies at two steps in each diagonal direction (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right), then:\n\n- From (2,4), two steps up-left would be (0,2), but since row can't be negative, it's invalid.\n\n- Two steps up-right: (0,6).\n\n- Two steps down-left: (4,2).\n\n- Two steps down-right: (4,6).\n\nBut in the output, we need to see where these would be placed. However, the output examples suggest that the copies are placed symmetrically around the original cell. For example, in Example 2's input, the 9 at (2,6) is mirrored to (2,2) and (6,6), which are symmetric across the vertical axis.\n\nSo applying this to the test input's 2 at (2,4), the mirrors would be (2,5) (since 4 mirrored across 4.5 is 5), but that's not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to mirror each non-zero cell across the vertical and horizontal midlines. For the test input's 2 at (2,4), mirroring across the vertical midline (columns 4.5) would be (2,5). Mirroring across the horizontal midline (rows 4.5) would be (7,4). And mirroring across both would be (7,5). But the output may have these positions filled with 2s.\n\nSimilarly, the 3s in the input would be mirrored across the midlines. For example, the 3 at (3,1) would mirror to (3,8), (6,1), (6,8). But the test input's 3s are in rows 3 and 5, columns 1-4 and 4.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Given the time, I'll have to proceed with the best pattern I can deduce.\n\nBased on the examples, the pattern seems to involve creating symmetric copies of each non-zero cell in the input. For example, each cell's value is placed at positions mirrored across the vertical and horizontal axes. \n\nFor the test input:\n\nThe 2 at (2,4) would be mirrored to positions (2,5), (7,4), and (7,5). Similarly, the 3s would be mirrored to their respective symmetric positions. However, in Example 1's output, the 3s are placed at (3,4) and (6,1), which suggests that the mirroring is done at a certain distance.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by placing each non-zero cell in the input and also its value at positions offset by the value in all four directions (left, right, up, down). For example, a 2 would generate copies two cells left, right, up, down.\n\nApplying this to the test input's 2 at (2,4):\n\n- Two cells left: (2,2)\n\n- Two cells right: (2,6)\n\n- Two cells up: (0,4)\n\n- Two cells down: (4,4)\n\nThe output would have 2s at these positions. But in the test input's output, there might be 2s at (2,2), (2,6), (4,4), etc. \n\nSimilarly, the 3s in the input would generate copies three steps away. For example, a 3 at (3,1) would generate copies at (3,4), (6,1), etc.\n\nThis seems to align with the training examples. So the pattern is: for each non-zero cell (r,c) with value N, place N in the output at (r, c \u00b1 N) and (r \u00b1 N, c), within the grid boundaries.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow 2 has a 2 at column 4. So N=2. \n\n- (2,4-2)= (2,2)\n\n- (2,4+2)= (2,6)\n\n- (2-2,4)= (0,4)\n\n- (2+2,4)= (4,4)\n\nSo these positions would have 2s.\n\nRow 3 has 3s at columns 1-3 and 5 (assuming the input is):\n\n[0,3,3,3,2,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo for each 3 in row 3:\n\nAt column 1: N=3\n\n- (3,1-3)= invalid\n\n- (3,1+3)= (3,4)\n\n- (3-3,1)= (0,1)\n\n- (3+3,1)= (6,1)\n\nAt column 2: N=3\n\n- (3,2-3)= invalid\n\n- (3,2+3)= (3,5)\n\n- (3-3,2)= (0,2)\n\n- (3+3,2)= (6,2)\n\nAt column 3: N=3\n\n- (3,3-3)= (3,0)\n\n- (3,3+3)= (3,6)\n\n- (3-3,3)= (0,3)\n\n- (3+3,3)= (6,3)\n\nAt column 5: N=3\n\n- (3,5-3)= (3,2)\n\n- (3,5+3)= (3,8)\n\n- (3-3,5)= (0,5)\n\n- (3+3,5)= (6,5)\n\nRow 4 has a 2 at column 3 and 5.\n\nFor column 3: N=2.\n\n- (4,3-2)= (4,1)\n\n- (4,3+2)= (4,5)\n\n- (4-2,3)= (2,3)\n\n- (4+2,3)= (6,3)\n\nFor column 5: N=2.\n\n- (4,5-2)= (4,3)\n\n- (4,5+2)= (4,7)\n\n- (4-2,5)= (2,5)\n\n- (4+2,5)= (6,5)\n\nRow 5 has 3s at columns 1-3 and 5:\n\nFor example, column 1: N=3.\n\n- (5,1-3)= invalid\n\n- (5,1+3)= (5,4)\n\n- (5-3,1)= (2,1)\n\n- (5+3,1)= (8,1)\n\nBut the output would include valid positions.\n\nAdditionally, overlapping cells would take the maximum value.\n\nPutting this together, the output would have:\n\n- 2s at (2,2), (2,6), (4,4), (0,4), (4,4), etc.\n\n- 3s at (3,4), (6,1), (6,5), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,5), (6,2), (6,3), (6,5), (3,0), (3,6), (3,8), (5,4), (2,1), (8,1), etc.\n\nBut considering that the original cells are also present, and overlapping cells would have the highest value.\n\nLooking at the training examples, when multiple numbers overlap, the higher one takes precedence. For example, in Example 0, the 7s are in the center, and 4s around.\n\nSo applying this to the test input, the output would have:\n\n- The original 2s and 3s.\n\n- New 2s and 3s generated by the above rules.\n\n- Where they overlap, the higher value remains.\n\nBut this is a lot to map out. Given the time, I'll proceed to create the output based on this pattern.\n\nAfter applying this rule, the test input's output would have 2s and 3s placed in symmetric positions based on their values. The 2s would generate copies two cells away, and the 3s three cells away.\n\nFor example, the 2 at (2,4) generates 2s at (2,2), (2,6), (0,4), (4,4). \n\nThe 3s in row 3, column 1 generate 3s at (3,4), (6,1), (0,1). \n\nThe 3s in row 3, column 2 generate (3,5), (6,2), (0,2). \n\nThe 3s in row 3, column 3 generate (3,0), (3,6), (0,3), (6,3). \n\nThe 3 in row 3, column 5 generates (3,2), (3,8), (0,5), (6,5).\n\nThe 2s in row 4, columns 3 and 5 generate:\n\nFor column 3: (4,1), (4,5), (2,3), (6,3).\n\nFor column 5: (4,3), (4,7), (2,5), (6,5).\n\nRow 5's 3s:\n\nFor column 1: (5,4), (2,1), (8,1).\n\nFor column 2: (5,5), (2,2), (8,2).\n\nFor column 3: (5,0), (5,6), (2,3), (8,3).\n\nFor column 5: (5,2), (5,8), (2,5), (8,5).\n\nWhere multiple values would overlap, the highest value remains. For example, at (2,2), the 2 from the original 2 and possibly a 3 from another cell. Since 3 is higher, it would take precedence.\n\nBut this is getting too detailed. The final answer would need to reflect this pattern in a way similar to the training examples.\n\nGiven the time, I'll conclude that the pattern is: each non-zero cell with value N in the input generates copies N steps to the left, right, up, and down in the output. The copies are filled with the same value N, and overlapping cells take the highest value.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the output should have new 2s and 3s placed accordingly.\n\nAfter doing this, the output would look like:\n\nFor example, the 2 at (2,4) creates 2s at (0,4), (4,4), (2,2), (2,6).\n\nThe 3s in row 3 create copies three steps away. For instance, the 3 at (3,1) creates (3,4), (6,1), (0,1).\n\nThe 3 at (3,2) creates (3,5), (6,2), (0,2).\n\nThe 3 at (3,3) creates (3,6), (6,3), (0,3).\n\nThe 3 at (3,5) creates (3,8), (6,5), (0,5).\n\nAnd similarly for other 3s and 2s.\n\nWhere there are overlaps, like at (3,4), which is generated by the 3 at (3,1) (3 steps right) and possibly other cells, the value remains 3.\n\nPutting this together, the test input's output would have new 3s and 2s in symmetric positions around the original cells. The final output would resemble the training examples, with higher values overlapping lower ones.",
