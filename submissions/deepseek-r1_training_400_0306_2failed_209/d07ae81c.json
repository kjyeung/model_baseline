        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we've got these training examples where each input is a list of numbers, and the output is another list with some changes. The goal is to see how the input transforms into the output and apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input has a bunch of 8s and 2s. In the output, some of the 8s are replaced with 1s or 4s, and some 2s become 4s. Let me check where exactly. For instance, the first line of input is [8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8], and the output is [8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,1,8,8]. So, the 10th element changed from 8 to 1. Similarly, in other lines, 8s are turning into 1s or 4s, and 2s into 4s. Maybe it's about the position of certain elements relative to others?\n\nWait, maybe it's related to the number of consecutive elements. Like, if there's a run of a certain number, you replace specific positions. But looking at Example 0's input, the 2s are in a long block. The output for those lines sometimes replaces a 2 with a 4, but in different positions. For example, the third line of input is all 2s, and the output has 4s in positions 1, 2, 6, etc. Maybe it's every third element or something? Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has 3s and 1s, and the output introduces 2s and 8s. For example, the first input line is [3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3], output is [3,3,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,3,3,3]. So the fourth element changed from 1 to 2, and the tenth from 3 to 8. Also, in some lines, 1s become 2s, and 3s become 8s. Maybe there's a substitution rule: 8 becomes 1, 2 becomes 4, 3 becomes 8, etc. But that doesn't fit all examples. Wait, in Example 0, 8s turn into 1s and 4s. Maybe it's more about the context around the numbers.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the transformation is based on the position of the number in the list relative to other numbers. For example, if a number is adjacent to a different number, it changes. Let's check. In Example 0's first input line, the 8s are followed by 2s. In the output, the last few 8s have a 1 inserted. Maybe the boundaries between different numbers are where changes happen. Like, at the edges where 8s meet 2s, certain elements are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about symmetry. Looking at the output arrays, maybe the 1s and 4s are placed symmetrically. But that's a bit vague. Let's think of the numbers as representing different regions. For instance, 8s and 2s might be two different regions, and the output modifies the borders between them. In Example 0, the output lines that have 8s and 2s have 1s or 4s inserted where the 8s and 2s meet. So, perhaps whenever there's a transition from one number to another, the elements at the transition points are changed to a specific value, maybe based on the adjacent numbers.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has 1s and 6s, and the output introduces 3s and 8s. For instance, in the first input line, some 6s become 3s. The 8s in the input (like position 7 in the fifth line) lead to 8s in the output but also other changes. So maybe when a certain number is surrounded by others, it's replaced. For example, in Example 2's input, the 8 is in the middle of 1s, and in the output, it's still 8 but maybe adjacent elements change. Or perhaps when a number is at a certain position relative to the edges or to other numbers, it's replaced.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that each row is being modified by inserting certain numbers (like 1, 4, 8, 2, etc.) at positions that are a certain distance from the boundaries between different numbers. For example, when a number changes from 8 to 2, maybe the first occurrence of 8 after the 2s becomes a 1 or a 4. Let me check Example 0 again. The first input line for Example 0 has a block of 8s, then 2s, then 8s. The output changes the 10th element (which is the third 8 after the 2s) to 1. Maybe the third element from the transition point is changed. Or maybe every nth element in the block is replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and replacing certain elements with another number based on their position in the row. For instance, the first row in Example 0's input is 12 elements long. The output changes the 10th element to 1. Let's count the positions (0-based or 1-based?). If it's 1-based, position 10 would be the 10th element. But how does that relate to the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's related to the position of the number in the sequence of same numbers. For example, in a block of 8s, the last few elements are being replaced. Like, in the first line of Example 0's input, after the 2s, there are 8s again. In the output, the 10th element (which is the fifth 8 after the 2s) is changed to 1. Maybe the fifth element in the 8s block is changed. But how would this apply to other examples?\n\nAnother angle: Let's look for the numbers that are introduced in the outputs. In Example 0, 1s and 4s appear. The input has 8, 2, 4, 1. The output adds 1 and 4. In Example 1, the numbers 2 and 8 are added. The input has 3, 1, 2, 8. The output adds 2 and 8. Example 2 adds 3 and 8. The input has 1,6,3,8. So the added numbers seem to be either existing in the input but less frequent, or perhaps they're derived from the existing numbers.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is replacing certain elements with the sum of adjacent elements. But looking at Example 0's first input line: [8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8]. The output has an 8 changed to 1. Summing adjacent elements doesn't make sense here. Alternatively, maybe the number of occurrences in the row. For example, if a number occurs a certain number of times, replace some elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a Caesar cipher shift? Like, adding 1 modulo some number. For instance, 8 becomes 1 (8-7=1?), 2 becomes 4 (2+2=4). But then in Example 1, 1 becomes 2, 3 becomes 8. Not sure how that fits. 3 to 8 would be +5, but 1 to 2 is +1. Doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the transformation is based on the position of the element in the row. For example, in a row, every nth element is changed. Looking at Example 0's first output line: the 10th element is 1. Let's see the positions. If the row is length 12, maybe elements at positions 9 (0-based) are modified. But checking other rows: In Example 0's third input line (all 2s), the output has 4s at positions 1 and 6. Maybe it's every 5th element or something. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation involves inserting a certain number (like 1 or 4) at positions where the element is surrounded by a different number. For example, if an 8 is next to a 2, it gets changed to 1. But in Example 0's first line, the 8s adjacent to 2s are at positions 3 and 7 (if 0-based). But in the output, the changed element is at position 9. Maybe it's not directly adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first occurrence of a number after a transition is changed. For instance, after the 2s in Example 0's first input line, the first few 8s are changed. But the output changes the 10th element (which is after several 8s). Hmm.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Maybe each row is treated as a grid (like a 2D array) and the transformation is similar to a cellular automaton, where each cell changes based on its neighbors. For example, if a cell is of type A and is adjacent to type B, it changes to a certain value. But how would that work with the given examples?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, there's a block of 8s, then 2s, then 8s. The output modifies some 8s to 1s and some 2s to 4s. Maybe the 8s that are near the 2s are replaced with 1s, and the 2s near the 8s are replaced with 4s. But how many positions away? Let's check the first line. The 2s are from index 3 to 6 (0-based). The output changes index 9 (which is 3 positions after the 2s end). So if the 8s after the 2s start at index 7, then index 9 is the third 8 in that block. So maybe every third element in the block gets replaced. But how about other lines?\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 in the middle of 1s. The output line for that row keeps the 2 but adds others. Hmm. Maybe not. Alternatively, the numbers are replaced based on their distance from a different number. Like, in a block of 8s, the elements that are a certain distance away from the edge where 8s meet another number are replaced.\n\nAnother possibility: The output replaces certain elements with a new number based on their position in the entire list. For instance, every time a certain number occurs after a run of another number, replace the nth occurrence. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each row has certain \"hotspots\" where the number is changed. For example, in the first row of Example 0's input, the 8s are on both ends. The output changes some 8s near the end. Maybe the hotspots are at specific intervals from the start and end of the row. Like, replacing the third element from the end with 1. But in the first line, the output changes the 10th element (assuming 12 elements, which is index 9 if 0-based). If it's the third from the end, that would be element 9 (since 12-3=9). Yes, that fits. Let's check other lines.\n\nIn Example 0's third input line (all 2s), the output has 4s at positions 1, 2, 6, etc. If it's third from the start and third from the end, position 2 and 9 (for 12 elements) but not sure. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe every third element from the start and end are being replaced. But in that case, for a row of 12, positions 2 and 9 (0-based) would be third from start and third from end. But the output has 4s at positions 1 and 6 in that line. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe elements at positions that are prime numbers or multiples are changed. But that seems too arbitrary.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern in the numbers that are introduced. For example, in Example 0, 8 becomes 1 or 4. 2 becomes 4. In Example 1, 3 becomes 8, 1 becomes 2. In Example 2, 6 becomes 3, 1 becomes 8. Wait, maybe there's a substitution code where each number is replaced by another specific number. For instance:\n\nIn Example 0:\n8 \u2192 1 or 4\n2 \u21924\n\nIn Example 1:\n3 \u21928\n1 \u21922\n\nIn Example 2:\n6 \u21923\n1 \u21928\n\nBut this isn't consistent. For example, in Example 2, sometimes 6 becomes 3 and sometimes 8 is present. Also, in Example 0, 8 can become 1 or 4. So maybe it's not a direct substitution but depends on context.\n\nWait, perhaps the new number is the sum of the adjacent numbers. For example, if a number is between two others, it's replaced by their sum. Let's test this. Take Example 0's first output line: the 1 at position 9. Adjacent elements are 8 and 8. 8+8=16, which isn't 1. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the number is replaced by the count of a certain neighboring number. For example, if an 8 is next to two 2s, it becomes 1. But again, not sure.\n\nLooking back at the test input. The test input has 8s and 3s, with a 4 in one line. The output would need to follow the same pattern. If the pattern from examples is that when a number A borders number B, then certain positions in A's block are replaced with another number, perhaps derived from A and B. For example, 8 next to 2 becomes 1 (maybe 8-7=1?), 2 next to 8 becomes 4 (2+2=4). In Example 1, 3 next to 1 becomes 8 (3+5=8?), 1 next to 3 becomes 2 (1+1=2). In Example 2, 6 next to 1 becomes 3 (6-3=3?), and 1 next to 6 becomes 8 (1+7=8). Not sure if this makes sense, but maybe there's a pattern where the new number is the result of a mathematical operation between the two adjacent numbers.\n\nAlternatively, the new number is the sum of the two different numbers. For example, in Example 0, 8 and 2: 8+2=10, but the new numbers are 1 and 4. Not sure. 8-2=6, which doesn't help. 8 mod 7=1, 2*2=4. That could fit. So maybe when a number is adjacent to another, it's replaced by (A mod 7) if it's A, or (B squared) if it's B. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair of adjacent different numbers contributes to the transformation. For instance, 8 and 2 become 1 and 4. Let's see:\n\n8 \u2192 1 (since 8 / 8 =1, but that's a stretch)\n2 \u2192 4 (2 squared)\n\nIn Example 1, 3 and 1:\n\n3 \u2192 8 (3 +5)\n1 \u2192 2 (1 +1)\n\nExample 2, 6 and 1:\n\n6 \u21923 (6/2)\n1 \u21928 (1+7)\n\nThis seems arbitrary, but maybe there's a pattern where the transformation for a number when adjacent to another is to apply a certain operation. For example:\n\nWhen number X is adjacent to number Y, replace X with X - Y + some value. But I need to see if this holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new numbers are based on the product of the positions. This seems too vague.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look for the positions where changes occur. For instance, in Example 0's first input line, the 8s after the 2s start at index 7. The output changes index 9 (two positions into the 8s block). In the second line of Example 0's output, the 8s are changed at index 0 (to 1) and index 8 (to 1). Maybe every third element in a block is changed. For example, in a block of 8s, every third 8 is replaced with 1. But in the first line's block of 8s after the 2s, there are 5 8s. So positions 7,8,9,10,11. If every third element starting from the beginning, position 7+2=9, which is changed to 1. That fits. Then the next would be 9+3=12, but there's no element there. So maybe once per block.\n\nIn Example 1's first input line, after the 1s, the 3s start again. The output changes the 10th element (index 9) from 3 to 8. If the block of 3s after the 1s starts at index 9 (since input is [3,3,3,1,...1,3,3,3,3,3]), so the 3s after the 1s are positions 9-13. Changing the first one (index 9) to 8. But according to the 'every third' idea, that's the first element, not third. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the last element of a block is changed. For Example 0's first output line, the block of 8s after the 2s is five elements long. The third element (index 9) is changed. If it's the middle element, five elements would have a middle at position 2 (0-based: 7,8,9,10,11 \u2192 middle is 9). So changing the middle element. In the second line of Example 0's output, the block of 8s before the 2s is three elements long. The first element is changed to 1 (index 0). Middle of three is index 1, but in the output, it's index 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each block of a number, replace elements that are at a certain distance from the transition point. For example, in a block of 8s followed by 2s, the last two 8s before the transition become 1s. Or the first few after the transition. In Example 0's first line, after the 2s, the 8s start again. The first few 8s after the transition: the output changes the third 8 (index 9) to 1. Maybe three positions into the new block.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler rule. Let's look at the test input. The test input has 8s and 3s, with a 4 in one line. The output should follow the pattern seen in the examples. For example, 8s adjacent to 3s might become 1 or 4, and 3s adjacent to 8s might become 2 or another number.\n\nIn Example 1, where 3s and 1s are present, the output changes 3s to 8s and 1s to 2s. So if the test input has 3s adjacent to 8s, maybe 3s become 8s and 8s become 1s. But there's also a 4 in the test input. How does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input's first line: [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. The 4 is already there. In the output, maybe the 4 remains, but adjacent elements change. For instance, 8s near the 4 could become 1s. Or the 4 might be a special case.\n\nAnother observation: In the training examples, the output numbers (like 1, 4, 8, 2, 3) seem to be lower than or equal to the input numbers. Wait, in Example 0, 8 becomes 1 (lower), 2 becomes 4 (higher). In Example 1, 3 becomes 8 (higher), 1 becomes 2 (higher). Example 2: 6 becomes 3 (lower), 1 becomes 8 (higher). So there's no clear direction. Hmm.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the transformation is based on the sum of the digits of the number. For example, 8 \u2192 8 \u2192 8, but no. 2 \u21924 (sum of digits is still 2). Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of the numbers as layers. The higher numbers are \"background\" and the lower numbers are \"foreground\". When a foreground element is next to background, certain changes happen. For example, in Example 0, 2 is foreground, 8 is background. When a background element is near the foreground, it's replaced with a transition number (1 or 4). But how to determine which one?\n\nAlternatively, the replacement numbers (1, 4, 8, 2, 3) might be the count of surrounding different numbers. For example, if an 8 is adjacent to two 2s, it's replaced by 2. But that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a common pattern across all examples.\n\nIn all examples, the output introduces new numbers that are not present in the input (except when they are). For instance, Example 0's input has 8, 2, 4, 1. The output introduces 1 and 4 (but 4 was already there). So maybe the 4 is part of the input and not a transformation. Wait, in Example 0's input line 5 (0-based), there's a 4. The output line 5 still has the 4. So perhaps the 4 is a special marker and left as is. Maybe the transformation leaves certain numbers (like 4) unchanged and modifies others.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for each block of the same number, replace certain positions with a specific value. The specific value depends on the original number. For example:\n\n- If the block is of 8s, replace every third element with 1.\n- If the block is of 2s, replace every other element with 4.\nBut this varies across examples.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is determined by the original number modulo something. For example, 8 mod 7 =1, 2 mod 6=2, but 2 becomes 4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is the number's position in the row modulo some value. For example, if the position is even, replace with a certain number.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output is the input with certain elements replaced by the count of their occurrences up to that point. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output lines, the 1s and 4s are placed in positions that are symmetric. For example, in the first output line, the 1 is at position 9 (assuming 0-based). In the second line, 1s are at positions 0 and 8. Maybe there's a pattern where the replacement occurs at mirrored positions. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replacements are done in a way that creates a diagonal pattern. For example, in Example 0's output lines, the 1s and 4s form diagonal lines when the rows are stacked. But I'm not sure how to check this without visualizing.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll try to hypothesize based on the test input. The test input has blocks of 8s and 3s, with a 4 in one line. If following the patterns from examples:\n\n- 8 adjacent to 3s might turn into 1 or another number.\n- 3s adjacent to 8s might turn into 2 or 8.\n\nLooking at Example 1, where 3s and 1s are present, 3s next to 1s become 8s, and 1s next to 3s become 2s. So maybe in the test input, 3s next to 8s become 8s, and 8s next to 3s become 1s. But there's also a 4, which may stay as is.\n\nLooking at the first line of the test input: [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. The 4 is present and might remain. The 8s around the 3s would turn into 1s. So the first three 8s before the 3s might stay, but the 8s after the 3s (starting at position 9) could have some replacements. For example, the 8 at position 9 could become 1, and the 8s after that could have replacements at certain intervals. \n\nAlso, the line with the 4 (position 10) might have the 4 remain, and adjacent 8s could be replaced. But according to Example 0, the 4 in the input remains in the output. So perhaps the 4 is left as is, and the surrounding 8s are modified.\n\nBut I'm not certain. Another approach is to look for the number of replacements per row. In the training examples, each output row has a similar number of changes as the input. For example, in Example 0, each output line has 1-3 changes. The test input has 19 elements per row, so the output would have a similar number of changes.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the following observations:\n\n- When a number A is adjacent to a different number B, certain positions in the block of A are replaced with a specific number.\n- The specific replacement number might be derived from A and B (like A mod something plus B mod something).\n- In Example 0, 8 becomes 1 and 2 becomes 4. Maybe 8 \u2192 1 (8 mod 7), 2 \u2192 4 (2*2).\n- In Example 1, 3 \u21928 (3+5), 1\u21922 (1*2).\n- In Example 2, 6\u21923 (6/2), 1\u21928 (1+7).\n\nApplying this to the test input where 8s and 3s are adjacent:\n\n- 8 adjacent to 3 would become 1 (8 mod 7 =1).\n- 3 adjacent to 8 would become 8 (3+5=8).\n\nSo, in the test input's first line, the 8s that are next to 3s would be replaced with 1. The 3s next to 8s would be replaced with 8. Also, any existing 4s would stay. \n\nFor example, the first line of test input:\n\n[8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nAfter transformation:\n\nThe first three 8s are followed by 3s. The 8s at the start (before 3s) are replaced with 1s in certain positions. Maybe the third 8 becomes 1. Then, the 3s next to 8s would become 8s. So the first few 3s might become 8s. The 8 after the 3s (position 9) could become 1. The 4 remains, and surrounding 8s could become 1s.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to be precise. Given the examples, perhaps the replacement happens at the third position from the transition point. For example, after a block of 3s, the third 8 in the next block becomes 1. And similarly, the third 3 in the block becomes 8.\n\nIn the test input's first line:\n\nThe block of 3s starts at position 3 (0-based) and has 6 elements. So positions 3-8. After that, there's an 8 at position 9, then 4 at 10, then 8s. So the 8s after the 3s start at position 9. The third 8 from the transition would be position 11. So replacing position 11 with 1. The 3s adjacent to 8s (the first few 3s) would have their third element replaced with 8.\n\nThis is a bit speculative, but given the time constraints, I'll proceed to generate the output based on such patterns. The final answer will follow the same format as the training examples, replacing certain elements with 1, 8, or others based on adjacency and position.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The goal is to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by analyzing the training examples one by one to see if I can spot any consistent transformations.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nThe input has multiple rows with 8s, 2s, and some 4 and 1. The output rows have similar numbers but with some elements changed to 1, 4, or 8. Looking at the first input row [8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8], the output becomes [8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,1,8,8]. So the 10th element (index 9) changed from 8 to 1. Another row in input is [8, 1, 8, 2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8], and the output is [8,1,8,2,2,2,2,1,8,8,8,8]. The 8th element (index 7) changed from 8 to 1. Hmm. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced based on their neighbors or some positional rule.\n\nLooking at another part of Example 0's input: the third row is all 2s, and the output for that row has some 4s. Like [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2] becomes [2,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2]. The 2s at positions 1 and 7 are replaced with 4. Maybe there's a rule that if a 2 is surrounded by other 2s, every other one becomes a 4? Or perhaps it's based on their position in the row.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 3s, 1s, and a 2. The output introduces 2s and 8s. For instance, the first input row [3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3] becomes [3,3,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,3,3,3]. Here, the 4th element (index 3) changed from 1 to 2, and the 10th (index 9) from 3 to 8. Another row in the input has a 2 in the middle of 1s, and the output keeps that 2 but adds others. It seems like certain positions are being modified, possibly based on the presence of a different number nearby.\n\nExample 2's input has 1s, 6s, and a few 3s and 8. The output introduces more 3s and 8s. For example, an input row [1,1,6,6,6,6,1,1,1,1,6,6,6,6,6] becomes [1,1,3,6,6,6,1,1,1,1,6,6,3,6,6]. The third element (index 2) changes from 6 to 3, and the 13th (index 12) from 6 to 3. Again, maybe positions are being targeted when adjacent to certain numbers.\n\nLooking for a common pattern across all examples, it seems like the transformation involves replacing certain elements with either a 1, 4, 8, 3, or another number, depending on their position and neighboring elements. But how exactly?\n\nAnother observation: in the outputs, the replaced numbers often appear in symmetric positions. For example, in Example 0's output row [2,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2], the 4s are at positions 1 and 7. If the row length is 12, then positions 1 and 10 (if zero-indexed) might be related. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in rows where there's a break between two different numbers (like 8 and 2 in Example 0), the elements at the ends of those blocks are being modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves inserting a new number (like 4 or 8) in positions that are a certain distance from the edges or from other numbers. For example, in the rows of 2s in Example 0, the 4s are inserted at intervals, perhaps replacing every third 2 or something like that. But the positions vary between different rows, which complicates that idea.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the transformation is based on the number of times a particular number appears consecutively. For instance, in Example 0's input, there's a block of four 2s followed by five 8s. The output modifies some of the 8s to 1s. Maybe when a block of a certain length is present, the first or last elements are changed.\n\nWait, looking at the first input row of Example 0: the 8s are in the first three positions, then four 2s, then five 8s. In the output, the last few 8s have a 1 inserted. Specifically, the output is [8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,1,8,8]. The 1 is at position 9 (if zero-based, that's the 10th element). The original 8s in that part are five in a row. Maybe inserting a 1 in the middle or near the end of a long block.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that in each row, the first occurrence of a number (like 8) is followed by replacing a specific position in the next block. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's first input row: [3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3]. The output replaces the 4th element (1) with 2 and the 10th element (3) with 8. Maybe the positions being modified are at certain offsets from the start or end of each block. For example, in the 1s block of six elements (indices 3-8), replacing the first element (index 3) with 2, and in the next 3s block (indices 9-13), replacing the first element (index 9) with 8. That could be a pattern: replace the first element of a block after a certain length.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the input rows have varying lengths, perhaps the transformation is related to the central position or mirroring. For example, in a row of even length, the middle two elements might be modified. But in Example 0, the first row has 12 elements. The middle would be positions 5 and 6. But the changes are at position 9, which is towards the end.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that whenever a row has a certain number (like 8, 3, etc.), the last occurrence of that number in the row is replaced with 1 or another number. For instance, in Example 0's first input row, the 8s end at position 7 (if the row is 0-based), but the output changes position 9 to 1, which is part of the trailing 8s. But how does that determine the position?\n\nAlternatively, looking for the number that appears the most in the row. But in Example 0, the first row has more 8s than 2s, but the output changes some 8s to 1s and 2s to 4s. Maybe the transformation depends on the majority element.\n\nAnother approach: compare input and output rows side by side. For Example 0's first row:\n\nInput: [8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8]\nOutput: [8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,1,8,8]\n\nThe difference is at index 9: 8 becomes 1. Similarly, in the next row of input (same as first), the output is [1,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,1,8,8,8]. Here, index 0 becomes 1, and index 8 becomes 1. Wait, this seems inconsistent. Maybe it's not based on the same rule for each row. Alternatively, perhaps the transformation involves inserting certain numbers at positions that are a certain distance from the start or end, or relative to other elements.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Example 0, the input has a 4 in the fifth row, which remains in the output. Maybe the presence of a unique number (like 4) affects the transformation of other elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain positions are replaced with a different number, and the pattern is that the replacement numbers (like 1, 4, 8) are inserted in positions that are mirrored or follow a diagonal pattern when looking at the entire grid. For example, in Example 0's output, the 1s and 4s might form a diagonal or some other shape when viewed across all rows.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output as a grid, the 1s and 4s are placed in a way that might form a diagonal. For instance, in the first output row, the 1 is at position 9. In the second row, positions 0 and 8. Then, in the third row, positions 1 and 7. Fourth row positions 2 and 6. Fifth row position 4. This seems like a diagonal moving leftwards each row. Maybe the pattern is that each row has a 4 or 1 placed at a position that decreases by one each row, creating a diagonal effect.\n\nFor instance, in Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: position 9 \u2192 1\nRow 1: positions 0 and 8 \u2192 1s\nRow 2: positions 1 and 7 \u2192 4s\nRow 3: positions 2 and 6 \u2192 4s\nRow 4: position 4 and 5 \u2192 4 and 2? Wait, the fifth row in output is [8,8,8,2,4,2,2,8,8,8,8,8], so position 4 becomes 4. Then row 5's output has 4 at position 3, perhaps? Wait, maybe it's a diagonal that starts from the right in the first row and moves left each subsequent row. This could form a diagonal line of 1s and 4s across the grid.\n\nIf that's the case, then the transformation is to place numbers (like 1,4,8) along a diagonal in the grid. But how does that apply to varying row lengths and different input numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is transformed by replacing the element that is \"k\" positions from the end, where \"k\" depends on the row index. For example, row 0 replaces the third element from the end, row 1 replaces the fourth, etc. But in Example 0's first output row, the 1 is at position 9 in a 12-element row, which is 3 positions from the end (since 12-9-1=2? Wait, indexes are zero-based. 12 elements: positions 0-11. The end is position 11. Position 9 is two positions from the end. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the position to replace is determined by the row number modulo some value. For instance, row 0: replace position 9, row 1: replace positions 0 and 8, row 2: positions 1 and 7, etc. It looks like in Example 0's output, each subsequent row's replacement positions are moving one step to the left and right from the center. But this is getting a bit vague.\n\nAnother angle: the numbers being inserted (1,4,8) might relate to the numbers present in the input. For instance, in Example 0, 8 and 2 are the main numbers. The output inserts 1 and 4. 8-7=1, 2+2=4. Maybe the inserted numbers are derived from the existing numbers. Similarly, in Example 1, inserting 2 and 8 where there are 3s and 1s. 3-1=2, and 3+5=8? Not sure.\n\nWait, Example 1's input has a 2 in one row, and the output increases the number of 2s. Maybe the inserted numbers are one more than the surrounding numbers. For example, inserting 2 where there's 1, or 4 where there's 3. But in Example 0, inserting 4 in 2s (2+2=4), which fits. In Example 1, inserting 2 in 1s (1+1=2). And inserting 8, which could be 3+5=8, but that's not clear. Alternatively, 8 might be a special case when replacing 3s. But in Example 1's output, the 8s are replacing 3s. For example, in the first output row, the 10th element (originally 3) becomes 8. So maybe when replacing a 3, it becomes 8, and when replacing a 1, it becomes 2. Similarly, in Example 2, 6s become 3s (6/2=3?), and 1s become 8s (as in some rows).\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation has two parts: (1) identify certain positions in each row to replace, and (2) replace the number at those positions with a specific value based on the original number. For example:\n\n- If the original number is 2, replace with 4.\n- If it's 1, replace with 2.\n- If it's 3, replace with 8.\n- If it's 6, replace with 3.\n- If it's 8, replace with 1.\n\nBut looking at the examples:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nOriginal numbers are 8, 2, 4. The replacements are 8\u21921, 2\u21924, and 4 stays the same.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nOriginal numbers are 3, 1, 2. Replacements are 3\u21928 (sometimes), 1\u21922, 2 remains.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nOriginal numbers are 1,6,3. Replacements are 6\u21923, 1\u21928 (sometimes), 3 remains.\n\nBut this isn't entirely consistent. For example, in Example 1's output, there's a row where a 3 is replaced with 8, but in other rows, 3s are replaced with 8s. However, in Example 0, 8s are sometimes replaced with 1s. So maybe the replacement depends on the original number and the position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number is the sum of the original number and the number of occurrences in the row. But this might not fit.\n\nAnother possibility is that the replacement is based on the original number plus its position modulo something. But this is getting too vague.\n\nLet me think about the test input. The test input has rows with 8s, 3s, a 4, and a 1. For example, the first row is [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. The output would need to follow the same pattern as the training examples. If the pattern is replacing certain positions with a specific number based on the original, then perhaps:\n\n- 8s become 1s or 4s (from Example 0)\n- 3s become 8s (from Example 1)\n- 4 remains as is (since in Example 0, the 4 in input remains)\n- 1 becomes 2 (from Example 1)\n\nBut how to determine which positions to replace.\n\nLooking at the structure of the test input rows:\n\nThe first row starts with three 8s, then six 3s, then an 8, a 4, followed by seven 8s. The length is 19 elements.\n\nIf the pattern from the training examples is to replace elements at positions that form a diagonal when the rows are stacked, then in the test input, each row might have a replacement at a position that steps through the row.\n\nAlternatively, considering the training examples, the replaced positions seem to be moving towards the center or in a wave-like pattern. For example, in Example 0's output, the replaced positions start at the end, then move left, then center, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the output has exactly one element changed (or a few), and the position of the change depends on the row index. For instance, the first row of the output in Example 0 changes the 10th element (0-based index 9), the next row changes the 0th and 8th, etc. This seems like a pattern where for each row, the position to change is determined by the row number modulo the row length or something.\n\nBut without knowing the exact rule, this is challenging. Let's try to find a pattern in the positions where changes occur in the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output rows:\n\nRow 0: [8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,1,8,8] \u2192 changed at index 9 (1)\nRow 1: [1,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,1,8,8,8] \u2192 indexes 0 and 8 (1s)\nRow 2: [2,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2] \u2192 indexes 1 and 7 (4s)\nRow 3: [2,2,4,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2] \u2192 indexes 2 and 6 (4s)\nRow 4: [2,2,2,4,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2] \u2192 indexes 3 and 5 (4s)\nRow 5: [8,8,8,2,4,2,2,8,8,8,8,8] \u2192 index 4 (4)\nRow 6: [8,8,8,4,2,4,2,8,8,8,8,8] \u2192 indexes 3 and 5 (4 and 2\u21924)\nRow 7: [1,8,1,2,2,2,4,8,8,8,8,8] \u2192 indexes 0, 2, 6 (1s and 4)\n... etc.\n\nThis seems like a diamond or hourglass pattern, where the changes start from the ends and move towards the center, then back out. For example, in rows 0-4, the positions where changes occur move from the end towards the center, then in row 5 it's the middle, and then they start moving out again. But this is speculative.\n\nIf this pattern holds, then in the test input's rows, which are longer (19 elements), the changes would be placed symmetrically around the center. For example, in row 0 of the test input, the center is at position 9 (since 19 elements, zero-based index 9 is the middle). The test input's first row has a 4 at index 10. Maybe the transformation would involve placing a 1 or 8 in positions around there.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in the test input, some rows have a 4 and a 1. For example, the first row has an 8,4, then the fifth row has a 1. According to the training examples, maybe 8s are replaced with 1s, 3s with 8s, and 4 remains. But how to apply this.\n\nLet's attempt to process the test input's first row:\n\nInput: [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nIf the pattern is to replace certain 8s with 1s and 3s with 8s, then perhaps the first occurrence of 8 after the 3s is replaced. For example, the first three 8s, then six 3s, then an 8,4, and more 8s. The first 8 after the 3s is at index 9. Maybe replacing that 8 (index 9) with 1. But in the input, index 9 is 8, and perhaps the output would have a 1 there. Then the 4 remains, and other 8s may be replaced elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the training examples, when there's a 4 in the input (like Example 0's fifth row), the output keeps it. So the 4 in the test input's first row might stay. The 3s might be replaced with 8s. For example, the six 3s in the middle. But in the training examples, when 3s are present (Example 1), they are replaced with 8s in some positions. But in Example 1, the 3s are replaced with 8s at the end of the row. So maybe in the test input's first row, the 3s are replaced with 8s, but some of them might turn into other numbers.\n\nWait, in Example 1's first output row, the 3s at the start remain, but one of them is replaced with 8. For instance, the input is [3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3], output becomes [3,3,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,3,3,3]. So the 3 at index 9 is replaced with 8. So maybe in the test input, the first occurrence of 3 in the row is replaced with 8, or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that whenever a number is followed by a different number, the last element of the first block is replaced with a certain value. For example, in the first row of Example 0, the 8s are followed by 2s. The last 8 before the 2s is index 2. But in the output, the replacement is at index 9, which is in the trailing 8s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace the nth occurrence of a number in the row. For example, replace the third 8 with 1. But in the first input row of Example 0, there are many 8s. The output changes one of them to 1. It's unclear which one.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to hypothesize a rule based on the training examples and apply it to the test input.\n\nHypothesis: For each row, if the row contains two different numbers (like 8 and 2 in Example 0), then in the output, replace the last occurrence of the first number (8) with 1, and insert 4s in the middle of blocks of the second number (2). For rows with the same number throughout, replace every other element with 4 starting from the center.\n\nBut in Example 0's third row, which is all 2s, the output introduces 4s at positions 1 and 7. If the row length is 12, then the center is between positions 5 and 6. Inserting 4s symmetrically around the center.\n\nApplying this to the test input's rows:\n\nTake the first row of the test input:\n\n[8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nThis row starts with three 8s, then six 3s, then an 8, a 4, and seven 8s. According to the hypothesis, the last occurrence of the first block (8s) is the third 8 (index 2). But the output would replace a later 8 with 1. Wait, in the Example 0's first row, the replacement was in the trailing 8s. So maybe in the test input's first row, the first 8 after the 3s is at index 9. Replacing that with 1. So the output would have [8,8,8,3,...8 replaced with 1, then 4, etc.].\n\nBut in the training examples, when there's a transition from 8 to 2, the trailing 8s have replacements. Similarly, in the test input's first row, after the 3s, there's an 8 followed by a 4 and more 8s. Maybe the 8 after the 3s (index 9) is replaced with 1, and the 3s might have some replacements.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s are six in a row. According to Example 1, where six 1s were present, the output replaced the fourth 1 with a 2. So maybe in the test input's six 3s, replace the fourth 3 with an 8. But the first row's 3s are at indices 3-8 (six elements). The fourth would be index 6. So replacing index 6 (which is 3) with 8. Then, the output would have 8 at that position.\n\nWait, in the test input's first row, the input is [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. The six 3s are from index 3 to 8. The fourth 3 is at index 6. Replacing it with 8 would make the output row have 8 at index 6. Then, in the trailing 8s after the 4, maybe replace one with 1. For example, the first 8 after the 4 (index 10 is 4, so next is index 11: 8. Replace with 1? Or index 10 is 4, so maybe no replacement there. The 4 remains.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Let's look for another angle.\n\nIn all training examples, the output rows have the same length as the input rows. So the transformation doesn't add or remove elements, only changes certain elements.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0, rows with all 2s have their 2s replaced with 4s in a pattern that looks like two 4s per row, moving inward each subsequent row. Similarly, in Example 1, rows with all 1s have 2s inserted in a similar pattern. So the pattern might be that for each row of a single number, the transformation inserts a higher number (2 for 1s, 4 for 2s, 8 for 3s) in positions that move inward each row, creating a diamond pattern.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's all-2 rows:\n\nRow 2: [2,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2] \u2192 positions 1 and 7\nRow 3: [2,2,4,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2] \u2192 positions 2 and 6\nRow 4: [2,2,2,4,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2] \u2192 positions 3 and 5\nRow 5: [8,8,8,2,4,2,2,8,8,8,8,8] \u2192 position 4 (middle)\nRow 6: [8,8,8,4,2,4,2,8,8,8,8,8] \u2192 positions 3 and 5 (4s)\nAnd so on.\n\nThis suggests that for rows of a single number, the transformation places higher numbers in a pattern that starts from the edges and moves towards the center row by row.\n\nApplying this to the test input's rows that are all 3s, like row 12: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3]. This row has a 1 in the middle. The output might replace the 1 with something else, or apply the pattern around it.\n\nAnother possible rule: If a row contains a single different number (like the 4 in Example 0's input row 5), then in the output, that number remains, and other numbers are transformed around it. For example, the 4 stays, and surrounding 2s become 4s.\n\nPutting this together, the transformation seems to involve two main cases:\n\n1. Rows with multiple numbers (e.g., 8 and 2 in Example 0): Replace certain elements in the trailing part of the dominant number with 1s or other numbers, possibly based on position from the end or neighboring blocks.\n\n2. Rows with a single number: Insert higher numbers (like 4 for 2, 2 for 1, 8 for 3) in a diamond pattern that moves inward each row.\n\nFor the test input, we need to apply these rules. Let's look at the test input rows:\n\nRow 0: [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\nRow 4: [3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow 12: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 0 has 8s, 3s, a 4, and then 8s. According to the first case, the trailing 8s after the 4 might have some replacements. The 3s are six in a row. Maybe in the 3s block, replace certain positions with 8s. For example, the fourth 3 (index 6) becomes 8. Then, in the trailing 8s, replace one with 1, perhaps the first 8 after the 4 (index 10 is 4, next is index 11: 8 \u2192 1).\n\nRow 4 has a 1 in the middle of 3s. According to the second case, if this is a single different number, maybe the 1 remains, and surrounding 3s are replaced with 8s in a pattern. For example, replacing the 3s around the 1 with 8s in a diamond pattern.\n\nRow 12 has a 1 at index 14. Similar to row 4, the 1 might stay, and surrounding 3s replaced with 8s.\n\nBut without seeing more training examples, this is guesswork. However, based on the patterns observed, I'll try to construct the output for the test input by applying the following rules:\n\n- For rows with a mix of numbers (like 8 and 3 in the first row), replace the last few elements of the dominant number (8) with 1s, and in the 3s block, replace middle elements with 8s.\n\n- For all-3 rows (like row 4 and 12), insert 8s in a diamond pattern, moving inward each row.\n\n- For the row with a 4, leave it as is and maybe replace surrounding 8s with 1s.\n\nApplying this to the first test input row:\n\n[8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nPossible changes:\n- In the six 3s (indices 3-8), replace the fourth 3 (index 6) with 8.\n- In the trailing 8s after the 4, replace the first 8 (index 11) with 1.\n\nSo the output row becomes:\n[8,8,8,3,3,3,8,3,3,8,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nBut need to check if this aligns with the training examples. For example, in Example 1's first row, the sixth 1 was replaced with 8. So replacing the fourth 3 with 8 might make sense.\n\nFor the all-3 rows, like row 4:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nAssuming the 1 remains, and the surrounding 3s are replaced with 8s in a diamond pattern. For example, in row 4 (assuming it's the fifth row in the test input), the diamond pattern would insert 8s two positions away from the 1. So indices 5 and 7 (around the 1 at index 6) become 8s. So the output row would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nSimilarly, in row 12, which has a 1 at index 14, the surrounding 3s (indices 13 and 15) might become 8s.\n\nThis is a plausible approach, but the exact pattern is unclear. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed to generate an output based on these hypotheses.",
