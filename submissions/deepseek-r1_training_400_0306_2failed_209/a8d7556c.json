        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists. Let's look at the training examples first to identify any common transformations.\n\nStarting with Example 0. Comparing the input and output, the first few rows are the same. But starting from the fifth input row (index 5), the output changes. Let's look at that row:\n\nInput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\nOutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\n\nHmm, the 5th and 6th elements (0-based index 5 and 6) in the input are both 0, which are replaced with 2 in the output. Let me check another row. In Example 0's input row 6:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\nOutput: [2, 2, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n\nHere, the first two 0s become 2s, and positions 5 and 6 (0-based) which were 0s also become 2s. Wait, maybe it's not 0-based. Let me check the indices again. Let's count from 0:\n\nOriginal input for row 6: [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,...]\nIndices 0,1,5,6 are 0. In output, those positions are 2. So maybe whenever there are two consecutive 0s in the input, they are replaced by two 2s? Let's check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1. Let's take row 1:\n\nInput: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\nOutput: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,2,2,5,5,0]\n\nHere, the original input has 0s at positions 13 and 14 (0-based). These become 2s in the output. So again, two consecutive 0s are replaced by 2s. Wait, but in this case, the input has 0,0 at positions 13 and 14, and the output has 2,2 there. So yes, consecutive 0s become 2s.\n\nBut wait, let's check another row. Example 1's input row 3:\n\nInput: [5,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\nOutput: [5,0,5,5,5,5,2,2,2,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nHere, the input has four 0s starting at position 6. The output replaces the first three with 2,2,2 and leaves the fourth as 0. Hmm, that complicates things. So maybe it's not exactly pairs of two. Or perhaps there's a different rule.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about runs of 0s. If there's a run of two 0s, replace them with two 2s. If there's a run longer than two, replace the first part? Let's see. The input row 3 in Example 1 has four 0s. The output replaces the first three with 2,2,2 and leaves the fourth as 0. Wait, but three 2s would be replacing three 0s, but the original was four 0s. That doesn't fit a simple pair replacement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe any occurrence of two 0s in sequence becomes 2s. Let's check Example 0's row 7:\n\nInput: [0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5]\nOutput: [2,2,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,2,5]\n\nWait, the first two 0s become 2s. The next two 0s (indices 4 and 5) remain 0s. Then the last two 0s (indices 14 and 15) become 2s. That contradicts the earlier idea. So why are some pairs replaced and others not?\n\nWait, looking at the input row 7 in Example 0:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5]\nOutput: [2, 2, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 5]\n\nWait, the first pair of 0s becomes 2s, the next pair (indices 4 and 5) are 0s in the output. Then the last pair (indices 14 and 15) become 2s. So why are some pairs replaced and others not? Maybe it depends on their position in the array. Or maybe the direction in which we process the array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement occurs for pairs of 0s that are adjacent and not followed by another 0. Let's think: If there's a pair of two 0s (and not part of a longer run), then replace with 2s. For example, in Example 0's row 5, the input is [0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0]. The fifth and sixth elements are 0,0, which are replaced by 2,2. Then there's a 0,0 later (indices 8 and 9) which are left as 0,0. Wait, but in the output, those are also 0,0. So why were the first pair replaced but not the second?\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's row 5 input and output again:\n\nInput row 5: [0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0]\nOutput row 5: [0,5,5,5,5,2,2,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nSo the first pair of 0s (indices 5 and 6) become 2s. The next pair (indices 8 and 9) remain 0s. Why? Maybe the replacement is done from the end of the array to the beginning, or vice versa. Or maybe the replacement is applied to the first occurrence of two 0s. But that doesn't explain why in some rows multiple pairs are replaced.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 1's row 3 again. Input: [5,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. Output: [5,0,5,5,5,5,2,2,2,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. The original input has a run of four 0s starting at index 6. The output replaces the first three 0s with 2s and leaves the last one as 0. That's strange. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that every even-positioned pair of 0s is replaced. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to pairs of 0s that are followed by a 5. Let's check some examples.\n\nIn Example 0's row 5, the pair at indices 5 and 6 (0,0) are followed by a 5 at index 7. They are replaced by 2s. The next pair at indices 8 and 9 (0,0) are followed by a 5 at index 10, but those 0s are not replaced. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for pairs of 0s that are in certain positions, like after the middle of the array. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, let's check another example. Take Example 2's input row 1:\n\nInput: [5,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5]\nOutput: [5,0,0,0,5,5,2,2,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nWait, here the input has a run of four 0s starting at index 6. The output replaces the first two with 2s, leaving the next two as 0s. So in this case, the first pair in the run is replaced, and the rest remains. So maybe whenever there's a pair of consecutive 0s, replace them with 2s, but only once per run? Or perhaps the first occurrence of a pair in each run is replaced.\n\nBut how to explain Example 1's row 3, where three 0s are replaced by three 2s. Wait, that's three 2s. So perhaps consecutive 0s of even length are replaced by 2s. For example, two 0s become two 2s. Four 0s become two pairs, each replaced by 2s. But in Example 1's row 3 input has four 0s (indices 6-9), but the output is three 2s and a 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for every pair of 0s, regardless of their position. But in some cases, overlapping pairs might be causing confusion. For example, in a run of three 0s, the first two are replaced, and the third is left. Then the third is part of the next pair (if there is another 0), but in a run of three, the third 0 has no pair. So perhaps the rule is to replace every consecutive pair of 0s with 2s, moving left to right, non-overlapping. So in a run of four 0s, the first two become 2s, then the next two become 2s. But in Example 1's row 3, the input has four 0s, but the output is three 2s and a 0. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to the first two consecutive 0s encountered, and then the rest are left as is. For example, in Example 0's row 5, the first pair is replaced, and the next pair is left. But why in Example 1's row 3, the first three 0s are replaced. Wait, that's three 0s. If the rule is to replace the first two, then the third 0 would remain. But in the output, it's replaced as well. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is that every occurrence of two 0s in a row is replaced by two 2s, but overlapping runs are allowed. For example, in a run of three 0s (positions 0,1,2), the pairs at (0,1) and (1,2) would both be replaced. But that would result in two pairs of 2s. But in Example 1's row 3, three 0s become three 2s, which could be from replacing each possible pair. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's row 1:\n\nInput: [5,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5]\nOutput: [5,0,0,0,5,5,2,2,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nHere, the input has four 0s at positions 6-9. The output has 2,2,0,0. So the first two are replaced, the next two remain. So perhaps the replacement is done once per run, replacing the first two 0s with 2s, and leaving the rest. Then, in Example 1's row 3, the four 0s become 2,2,2,0. Wait, but that's three 2s. Maybe there's a different rule here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to all consecutive pairs of 0s in the entire list. For example, for every two consecutive 0s, replace them with 2s, but processing from left to right and not overlapping. So in a run of four 0s, you would replace positions 0-1 as 2s, then 2-3 as 2s, resulting in four 2s. But in Example 2's row 1, the four 0s are replaced as two 2s and two 0s. That doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to find another approach. Let's compare the input and output lists for all examples and see if there's a pattern in where the 2s appear.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nIn the input rows, the 2s in the output appear in positions where there are consecutive 0s. For example, in row 5, positions 5-6 (0-based) are 0,0 \u2192 2,2. Similarly, row 6 has 0,0 at positions 0-1 and 5-6 \u2192 replaced with 2,2 in output. Row 7 has 0,0 at positions 0-1 and 14-15 \u2192 replaced with 2,2. Row 8 has 0,0 at positions 14-15 \u2192 2,2. So it seems that consecutive 0s are replaced by 2s in pairs.\n\nBut in Example 1's row 3, input has four 0s (indices 6-9), output is 2,2,2,0. So three 2s and a 0. That breaks the pair rule. Hmm. Wait, maybe the number of 2s depends on the number of 0s in the run. For example:\n\nIf a run of 0s has length n, then replace the first n-1 0s with 2s, leaving the last as 0. For example:\n\n- Run of 2 \u2192 replace both with 2s (n=2, n-1=1: wait, that's not adding up).\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's take a few rows and see exactly what's happening.\n\nExample 1's input row 3:\n\nInput: [5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nOriginal run of 0s: positions 6-9 (four 0s). Output is 2,2,2,0. So three 2s and a 0. That suggests that in a run of four 0s, the first three are replaced with 2s, leaving one. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe every 0 that is followed by another 0 is replaced with a 2, and the last 0 in the run remains. For example:\n\nIn a run of two 0s, both are replaced by 2s (since each is followed by a 0). In a run of three 0s, the first two are followed by 0s, so replaced by 2s, and the last remains. Wait, but in the run of four 0s (positions 6-9 in Example 1's row 3 input), the output is 2,2,2,0. So the first three are replaced, and the last remains. But according to the rule where any 0 followed by another 0 is replaced by 2, then for four 0s:\n\nIndices 6: 0 followed by 0 \u2192 2\n\n7: 0 followed by 0 \u2192 2\n\n8: 0 followed by 0 \u2192 2\n\n9: 0 followed by non-zero \u2192 remains 0.\n\nWait, but in the input, index 9 is followed by a 5 (since the next element is index 10 which is 5). So according to this rule:\n\nEach 0 that is followed by another 0 (i.e., part of a consecutive pair) is replaced by 2. The last 0 in the run (index 9) is followed by a 5, so it remains 0. But in the output, the fourth 0 (index 9) is replaced by 0. But in the output for this row, the elements are [2,2,2,0]. So indices 6,7,8 are 2s, index 9 is 0. So the first three 0s are replaced, but the fourth is not. So each pair in the run is processed. For four 0s, there are three overlapping pairs: (6-7), (7-8), (8-9). But if processing non-overlapping, then two pairs: (6-7) and (8-9). But in the output, three 2s and one 0. So overlapping is allowed? That would mean each 0 that is part of a pair is replaced. For example:\n\nEach 0 in a run of two or more is replaced by 2 except the last one. Wait, but in a run of two 0s, both are replaced. So how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace every even-positioned 0 in a run. But that's not consistent.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the replacement is that all 0s are replaced by 2s except when they are the last in a run. So:\n\n- For a run of 1: remains 0.\n\n- For a run of 2: both become 2s.\n\n- For a run of 3: first two become 2s, third remains 0.\n\n- For a run of 4: first three become 2s, fourth remains 0.\n\nBut how does that fit the examples?\n\nExample 1's row 3 has a run of four 0s. According to this, first three become 2s, fourth remains. Which matches the output: [2,2,2,0].\n\nAnother example: in Example 0's row 5, the input has a run of two 0s \u2192 replaced by two 2s.\n\nExample 0's row 7 has two runs of two 0s: the first and last. Both are replaced by 2s.\n\nExample 2's row 1 has a run of three 0s (indices 6-8: wait no, in Example 2's row 1 input, the run is four 0s (indices 6-9). Wait, Example 2's input row 1 is:\n\n[5,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nOutput: [5,0,0,0,5,5,2,2,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nAh, the run here is four 0s (indices 6-9). The output is 2,2,0,0. So first two replaced, next two not. That contradicts the previous idea. Because according to the run length of four, we would expect three 2s and one 0. But here, two 2s and two 0s.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the pattern isn't consistent based on run length. Maybe there's another factor.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, perhaps the 2s are replacing 0s that are in certain positions, like the middle of the array. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done only when there are exactly two 0s in a row, and in longer runs, they are left as is. But in Example 1's row 3, four 0s are replaced by three 2s and a 0, which doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the replacement is applied to 0s that are adjacent and followed by a 5. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's row 5: the 0,0 is followed by 5 (index 7). So replaced by 2s.\n\nExample 0's row 6: the first two 0s are followed by 5 (index 2), so replaced by 2s. The 0s at indices 5 and 6 are followed by 5 (index 7) \u2192 replaced by 2s.\n\nExample 1's row 1: the 0s at positions 13 and 14 (followed by 5) \u2192 replaced by 2s.\n\nExample 1's row 3: the four 0s are followed by 5 at index 10. So the first three are replaced by 2s, and the fourth remains 0. That doesn't fit. If they are followed by 5, all four should be replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the position in the array. For example, the 2s are placed in specific columns. But looking at the outputs, the 2s appear in varying positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that whenever there's a 0 in the input, and the corresponding position in the output is a 2, but only if there's another 0 adjacent. Let's think:\n\nEach 0 that is part of a consecutive pair (or more) is replaced by 2. So any 0 that is followed by another 0 becomes a 2. The last 0 in a run remains 0.\n\nFor example, in a run of two 0s:\n\nOriginal: 0,0 \u2192 becomes 2,2.\n\nRun of three 0s: 0,0,0 \u2192 becomes 2,2,0.\n\nRun of four 0s: 0,0,0,0 \u2192 becomes 2,2,2,0.\n\nBut in Example 2's row 1, the run of four 0s becomes 2,2,0,0. Which doesn't fit. So this rule doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 0 in a run except the first one is replaced by 2. So run of two: 0,0 \u2192 0,2. But that's not what's happening in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is that every other 0 in a run is replaced by 2. For example, in a run of two, both become 2s. Run of three: first and third become 2s. Doesn't fit examples.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to find a different approach. Let's compare the input and output for each position in the examples.\n\nTake Example 0's row 5:\n\nInput: [0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nOutput: [0,5,5,5,5,2,2,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nThe only changes are positions 5 and 6 (0s \u2192 2s). Other 0s in the input (positions 0,8,9,11,17) remain 0s in output. So why are positions 5 and 6 replaced? They are consecutive 0s. The other 0s are either single or in pairs (positions 8 and 9: 0,0 in input but remain 0,0 in output). So why are some pairs replaced and others not?\n\nWait, looking at the input for row 5 in Example 0: the pair at 5-6 is followed by 5. The pair at 8-9 is followed by 5. So why are they not replaced?\n\nAh, wait, in the output, the pair at 8-9 remains 0,0. So this contradicts the earlier idea that consecutive 0s are replaced. There must be another condition.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement is applied to the last occurrence of two consecutive 0s in the array. Let's check:\n\nIn row 5 of Example 0, the pair at 5-6 is replaced. The pair at 8-9 is not. The last pair is at 8-9. But they are not replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to the first occurrence of two consecutive 0s. But in row 5, the first occurrence is at 5-6, which is replaced, and the next occurrence at 8-9 is not. So that fits. But in row 7 of Example 0, there are two pairs replaced (positions 0-1 and 14-15). So the first and last pairs are replaced. That contradicts the first occurrence idea.\n\nWait, in Example 0's row 7:\n\nInput: [0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5]\n\nOutput: [2,2,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,2,5]\n\nSo both the first pair (0-1) and the last pair (14-15) are replaced. So the replacement is applied to all consecutive pairs of 0s. But why in row 5 of Example 0, the second pair (8-9) is not replaced.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's see another example. Take Example 2's row 1:\n\nInput: [5,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nOutput: [5,0,0,0,5,5,2,2,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nHere, the input has four 0s starting at index 6. The output has 2,2,0,0. So first two replaced, next two not. So why are the first two replaced and the others not?\n\nPerhaps there's a directional component. Maybe the replacement is applied from left to right, and once a replacement is made, the next elements are skipped. But in row 7 of Example 0, both pairs are replaced. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is applied to every other pair of consecutive 0s. But that also doesn't fit.\n\nLet me try to think of another pattern. The output only changes certain 0s to 2s. What's common about the positions where 2s are introduced?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the 2s are placed in positions where there were 0s in the input, but only in certain rows. Perhaps the transformation is applied to specific rows, like every sixth row. But the examples show that multiple rows have transformations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are introduced in the middle of the array. But in Example 0's row 5, the 2s are at positions 5 and 6, which are towards the middle. Row 6's 2s are at the beginning and middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement happens only when the pair of 0s is surrounded by 5s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's row 5, the pair at 5-6 is followed by 5 (index 7). The previous element is 5 (index 4). So the pair is between 5 and 5. But the pair at 8-9 is between 5 (index 7) and 5 (index 10). So why are they not replaced?\n\nThis doesn't hold.\n\nWait, looking at the test input rows:\n\nTest input row 0: [0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nLet's apply the pattern we're trying to find. For instance, are there consecutive 0s here?\n\nYes, positions 0-1-2 (three 0s), then position 4 is 0, then positions 6-7 are 0s.\n\nIf the rule is to replace consecutive 0s with 2s, then:\n\n- The first three 0s (positions 0-2): perhaps replaced as 2,2,0?\n\n- The pair at 6-7 (0s) would become 2,2.\n\nBut according to the examples, in a run of three 0s, the first two become 2s and the third remains. So, in the test input row 0, the three 0s would become 2,2,0. Then the pair at 6-7 would become 2,2. The other single 0s (positions 4, 10, 16,17) remain.\n\nBut how does this fit with the examples? Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1's row 3, a run of four 0s becomes three 2s and a 0. So in a run of four, first three 0s become 2s. But why? If the rule is to replace all 0s except the last one, then:\n\nRun of length n: replace n-1 0s with 2s, leave the last as 0.\n\nSo:\n\n- Run of 2 \u2192 replace both as 2s (n-1=1, but that would leave one. Hmm, maybe not.)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that every 0 in a run except the last is replaced by 2. So:\n\n- Run of 1 \u2192 0.\n\n- Run of 2 \u2192 2,0.\n\n- Run of 3 \u2192 2,2,0.\n\n- Run of 4 \u2192 2,2,2,0.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 5, the run of two 0s becomes two 2s. So this contradicts. So that can't be.\n\nAnother idea: the replacement is done for every pair of 0s, regardless of their position. So every time two 0s appear consecutively, they become 2s. But this would mean that overlapping pairs are allowed. For example, a run of three 0s would have two overlapping pairs (0-1 and 1-2), both replaced by 2s, leading to three 2s. But in Example 2's row 1, a run of four 0s becomes two 2s and two 0s, which would be if only the first two are replaced. So maybe the replacement is non-overlapping, left to right.\n\nFor example:\n\nProcess the array from left to right. Whenever two consecutive 0s are found, replace them with 2s and skip the next element.\n\nSo:\n\nRun of two 0s: replace both \u2192 2,2.\n\nRun of three 0s: replace first two \u2192 2,2,0.\n\nRun of four 0s: replace first two \u2192 2,2,0,0.\n\nBut then in Example 1's row 3, a run of four 0s becomes 2,2,2,0. That doesn't fit. So this approach also doesn't explain it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to every even-indexed pair of 0s. For example, pairs at even indices are replaced. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother observation: in all the examples, the 2s only appear in the outputs and not in the inputs. So the transformation must involve replacing certain 0s with 2s. The key is to find which 0s are replaced.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output row 5 again: the input had two pairs of 0s (positions 5-6 and 8-9). The output replaces the first pair with 2s and leaves the second as 0s. Why?\n\nIs there a pattern based on the position in the array? Like replacing pairs in the first half but not the second? Or based on some other positional rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to pairs of 0s that are not followed by another 0. For example, if two 0s are followed by a non-zero, they are replaced. If they are followed by another 0, they are not. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's row 5 input: the pair at 5-6 is followed by 5. So replaced. The pair at 8-9 is followed by 5. But in the output, they are not replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nExample 0's row 7 input: pairs at 0-1 and 14-15 are followed by 5 and 5, respectively. They are replaced. So this fits.\n\nExample 1's row 3 input: the four 0s are followed by 5. The first three are replaced, the fourth remains. But according to this rule, pairs followed by non-zero should be replaced. So in four 0s, the first pair (0-1) is followed by 0-2, then 0-3, etc. No, this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the replacement is based on the number of 5s surrounding the 0s. For example, if a pair of 0s is surrounded by 5s, they are replaced. But in Example 0's row 5, the pair at 5-6 is between 5 and 5 (indices 4 and 7). But the pair at 8-9 is between 5 and 5 (indices 7 and 10). So why are they not replaced?\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to find a different approach.\n\nLet's look at the test input and see if we can predict the output based on the possible patterns we've considered.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nLooking for consecutive 0s:\n\n- Positions 0-1-2: three 0s.\n\n- Position 4: single 0.\n\n- Positions 6-7: two 0s.\n\n- Positions 16-17: two 0s.\n\nIf the pattern is to replace all pairs of consecutive 0s with 2s, regardless of their position, then:\n\n- The three 0s at 0-2: possible replacements. If we process non-overlapping pairs:\n\n- Replace 0-1 with 2s, then leave 2. So becomes 2,2,0.\n\n- The pair at 6-7: replaced with 2,2.\n\n- The pair at 16-17: replaced with 2,2.\n\nSo the output for this row would be:\n\n[2,2,0,5,0,5,2,2,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,2,2]\n\nBut looking at the examples, this might not be correct. For example, in Example 0's row 5, a pair of 0s is replaced, but another pair in the same row is not. So there's something else.\n\nAnother observation: in the training examples, the output is almost the same as the input, except certain 0s are replaced with 2s. The rows that have changes are the ones where the input has consecutive 0s in certain positions. For example, in Example 0's row 5, the first pair is replaced, the second pair is not. Why?\n\nWait, maybe the replacement occurs only in specific rows, not all. Looking at the training examples:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first five rows are the same as the input. Starting from row 5, changes occur. Similarly, in Example 1, changes start from row 1. So perhaps the replacement is applied to rows where certain conditions are met, like the row index being a multiple of 5? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to rows where the row index (starting from 0) is even or odd. Example 0's first changed row is row 5 (index 5, which is odd). Example 1's first changed row is row 1 (odd). Example 2's first changed row is row 1 (odd). So perhaps the replacement is applied to rows with odd indices. But in Example 0's row 5 (index 5, odd), the replacement is done. Row 6 (index 6, even) also has changes. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is applied to every row. But in Example 0, the first five rows are unchanged. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is applied to rows where the sum of elements meets a certain condition. But this seems complex.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace every second occurrence of two consecutive 0s with 2s. But without knowing the order, this is hard to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done only to pairs of 0s that are followed by a 5 and preceded by a 5. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's row 5: the pair at 5-6 is preceded by 5 (index 4) and followed by 5 (index 7). So replaced.\n\nThe pair at 8-9 is preceded by 5 (index 7) and followed by 5 (index 10). But not replaced. So this doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is done to pairs of 0s that are flanked by 5s on both ends. For example, in a sequence like 5,0,0,5. In Example 0's row 5, the pair at 5-6 is between 5s. But the pair at 8-9 is also between 5s. So why are they not replaced?\n\nThis is perplexing. Perhaps there's a different pattern, like considering the entire array as a grid and looking for 2x2 squares of 0s. But that seems unlikely given the input structure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input row 5:\n\nInput: [0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nOutput: [0,5,5,5,5,2,2,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nThe pair at 5-6 is replaced, but the pair at 8-9 is not. What's different between these two pairs? Let's look at their surrounding elements.\n\nFor the pair at 5-6: surrounded by 5s (indexes 4 and 7). The pair at 8-9: preceded by 5 (index7) and followed by 5 (index10). So both are between 5s. So why is one replaced and the other not?\n\nAnother possibility: the number of 5s before or after the pair. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is applied to pairs of 0s that are in specific positions within the array, such as the middle third. But without a clear pattern, this is hard to determine.\n\nPerhaps the key is to look at all the examples and find a common rule that explains all the changes. Let's list out all the changes from input to output in each example.\n\nExample 0's changes:\n\n- Row 5: 0,0 \u2192 2,2 (positions 5-6)\n\n- Row 6: 0,0 \u2192 2,2 (positions 0-1), and 0,0 \u2192 2,2 (positions5-6)\n\n- Row7: 0,0 \u21922,2 (0-1), and 0,0 \u21922,2 (14-15)\n\n- Row8: 0,0 \u21922,2 (14-15)\n\n- Row13: ?\n\nWait, maybe I should compare each input and output row.\n\nBut this is time-consuming. Let me pick a few more examples.\n\nExample 1's row 1:\n\nInput: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nOutput: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,2,2,5,5,0]\n\nThe pairs at positions 13-14 (0,0) are replaced by 2,2.\n\nExample 1's row 3:\n\nInput: [5,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nOutput: [5,0,5,5,5,5,2,2,2,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nRun of four 0s \u2192 three 2s and one 0.\n\nExample 2's row 1:\n\nInput: [5,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nOutput: [5,0,0,0,5,5,2,2,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nRun of four 0s \u2192 two 2s and two 0s.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that there's a more complex pattern, perhaps involving the position within the row or the row's index.\n\nAnother possibility: the replacement happens every time there are two 0s in the same position across multiple rows. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the number of 5s in the row. For example, if the row has a certain number of 5s, then replace pairs of 0s. But this also seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's row 5 input: the pair is replaced. The row has many 5s. Example 1's row 1 has fewer 5s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to pairs of 0s that are preceded by a certain number of 5s. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the pattern is to replace every pair of 0s that form a \"border\" around 5s. For example, in a sequence like 5,0,0,5, the 0s are replaced. But in the examples, this isn't consistently applied.\n\nAfter struggling with various hypotheses, I think the most plausible pattern is that any consecutive pair of 0s in the input is replaced by two 2s in the output, regardless of their position or surrounding elements. However, in some examples, this doesn't hold, such as Example 0's row 5 where a second pair of 0s is not replaced. This inconsistency might suggest that the pattern is to replace the first occurrence of consecutive 0s in each row. But in Example 0's row 7, two pairs are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for every occurrence of two consecutive 0s in the row, but only the first occurrence is replaced. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's row 5 has two pairs of 0s. Only the first is replaced. Row 7 has two pairs, both are replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to look for the replacement of every even-numbered occurrence of two consecutive 0s. But again, this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. The common thread is that consecutive 0s are replaced by 2s in pairs. However, in some cases, longer runs are partially replaced. The most consistent rule seems to be that every consecutive pair of 0s is replaced by two 2s, but in the case of odd-length runs, the last 0 remains.\n\nSo for the test input, apply this rule: replace every consecutive pair of 0s with two 2s. If there's an odd number of 0s in a run, the last one stays 0.\n\nFor example, in test input row 0: [0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nThe runs of 0s are:\n\n- 0-2: three 0s \u2192 replace first two \u2192 2,2,0.\n\n- position 4: single 0 \u2192 remains.\n\n- 6-7: two 0s \u2192 replace with 2,2.\n\n- 16-17: two 0s \u2192 replace with 2,2.\n\nSo the output row 0 would be: [2,2,0,5,0,5,2,2,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,2,2]\n\nApplying this to all test input rows where consecutive 0s are replaced.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, there are cases where longer runs are handled differently. For example, Example 1's row 3 has four 0s replaced by three 2s and one 0. But according to the rule, two pairs would become four 2s. So this suggests a different pattern.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that consecutive pairs of 0s are replaced by two 2s, and apply this to the test input.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a list of lists of numbers (mostly 5s and 0s), and the output seems to modify some of the 0s to 2s. \n\nFirst, let's compare the input and output for Example 0. Let's take the first few rows. The first input row in Example 0 is [5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,...] and the output is the same. But then, looking at the sixth input row (index 5) in Example 0, the input is [0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0], and the output changes the two 0s at positions 5 and 6 to 2s. So, in the output, the 0s at positions 5 and 6 (0-based index) are now 2s. Similarly, in the next row, the input starts with [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,...], and in the output, the first two 0s become 2s, and the next two 0s (positions 5 and 6) also become 2s.\n\nSo, maybe there's a rule where consecutive 0s in certain positions are replaced with 2s. Let's look for a pattern in where the 0s are replaced. It seems that when there are two consecutive 0s, they get changed to 2s. But wait, not all consecutive 0s are changed. For example, in Example 0's fifth row (input index 5), the input has [0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0...]. The output changes the 0s at positions 5 and 6 to 2s, but the 0s at positions 8 and 9 (0-based) remain 0. So why some pairs are changed and others aren't?\n\nHmm. Let's check another example. In Example 1, the second input row is [5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0]. The output changes the last two 0s (positions 12 and 13) to 2s. Wait, the input has four 0s there (indices 12,13,14,15?), wait the input is [5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0]. Wait, indices 11 is 0, then 12,13,14 are 0s. But in the output, it's [5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,2,2,5,5,0]. So the 0s at positions 13 and 14 are changed to 2s. Wait, but there were three 0s in a row. So maybe it's the last two of a group of consecutive 0s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement occurs when there are exactly two consecutive 0s, but that's not the case in Example 0's fifth row. There, the two 0s are replaced. But in other cases, like in Example 1's third row input: [5,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0], the output becomes [5,0,5,5,5,5,2,2,2,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. Here, the first three 0s (indices 6,7,8) are replaced with 2,2,2? Wait, no. The input was four 0s, but the output starts with 2,2,2 and then 0. So maybe the first three 0s are replaced. But that doesn't fit with previous examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for pairs of 0s that are adjacent and in certain positions, perhaps starting from the left. Or maybe the pattern is that every pair of 0s in the input is replaced with 2s, but only if they are followed by a 5. Wait, in Example 0's fifth row, the 0s at positions 5 and 6 (0-based) are followed by a 5. Let's check: input row 5 (Example 0) is [0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0]. The 0s at positions 5 and 6 are followed by a 5 (position 7). The output replaces them with 2s. The next pair of 0s (positions 8 and 9) are followed by a 5 (position 10?), but in the output, those 0s remain. So that theory doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is when the pair of 0s is at the end of a sequence. Wait, in Example 0's fifth row, the 0s are in the middle, not the end. Hmm.\n\nLooking at another example. Example 1's input row 3: [5,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. The output replaces the first three 0s with 2s, but leaves the fourth 0 as 0. So it's [2,2,2,0]. That's three 2s. So the replacement isn't limited to pairs. Maybe the rule is that any consecutive 0s starting from the left are replaced with 2s, but only up to three? Or perhaps the first occurrence of a pair of 0s in a group is replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is that whenever there are two or more consecutive 0s, replace them with 2s. But in Example 0's fifth row, the pair of 0s becomes 2s. But in the third example, a group of four 0s becomes three 2s and a 0, which doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps it's replacing the first two 0s in a group with 2s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's input row 3: four 0s. Output is [2,2,2,0]. Wait, that's three 2s. That complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps consecutive 0s are replaced starting from the first occurrence, and each pair is replaced. But four 0s would be two pairs. So two pairs would become four 2s? But in Example 1's row 3 output, it's three 2s. Hmm. Maybe the replacement is done in a sliding window of two, but overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in each row, the first occurrence of two consecutive 0s is replaced with 2s. Let's check. In Example 0, the fifth input row (index 5) is [0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0]. The first two 0s are at positions 5 and 6. In the output, they are replaced. Then the next two 0s at 8 and 9 are not replaced. So maybe only the first occurrence of two 0s is replaced.\n\nBut wait in Example 0's sixth row (input index 6), the input starts with [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,...]. The output starts with [2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,...]. So both pairs of 0s at the start and positions 5 and 6 are replaced. So that's two pairs replaced. So the rule can't be just the first occurrence.\n\nHmm. Maybe the replacement is for all pairs of consecutive 0s. But in Example 0's fifth input row, after the first pair (indices 5-6), there's another pair (8-9) which remain 0s. So that doesn't fit. So maybe there's another condition. Let's look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at the positions where the 0s are replaced. Maybe the replacement happens only when the 0s are in certain columns. For example, in Example 0, the fifth row's 0s at positions 5 and 6 (columns 5 and 6) are replaced. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1's row 2 input: [5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0]. The output changes the 0s at positions 12 and 13 (indices 12 and 13) to 2s. Wait, the input here has 0s at positions 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 17. The output has [0,5,5,5,5,0,0,2,2,5,5,0]. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let's look again. The input row in Example 1's second row is [5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0]. The output is [5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,2,2,5,5,0]. So the 0s at positions 12 and 13 (indices 12 and 13) are replaced, while the ones at 14 and 15 (if any) remain. So maybe it's the third and fourth zeros in a group of four being replaced? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to every even occurrence of consecutive zeros. Or perhaps it's based on their position modulo some number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for consecutive 0s that are followed by a 5. For example, in Example 0's fifth row, the 0s at 5 and 6 are followed by 5 (position 7). The next pair at 8 and 9 are followed by 5 (position 10). But in the output, the first pair is replaced, the second isn't. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps each row is divided into groups of three elements, and within each group, if there are two 0s, they are replaced with 2s. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth row input: [0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0]. If we split into groups of three: [0,5,5], [5,5,0], [0,5,0], [0,5,0], etc. But the replacement happens at positions 5 and 6, which are in the second group [5,5,0], but that group's third element is 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced when they are in even positions. For example, looking at the fifth row, the 0s at positions 5 and 6 (indices 5 and 6, which are even and odd?) Not sure. Alternatively, the replacement could be based on their position in the row. For example, in the fifth row of Example 0, the two 0s replaced are at positions 5 and 6. The length of each row is 18 elements. Maybe looking at columns 5 and 6 across all rows?\n\nWait, looking at the test input. Let's consider that perhaps the pattern is to replace every pair of 0s that start at an even index. For example, in the fifth row, the first pair is at index 5 (odd) and 6 (even), but that's just a guess. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for every pair of 0s that are followed by a 5. Let's check Example 0's fifth row again. The replaced 0s at positions 5 and 6 are followed by a 5 (position 7). The next pair at 8 and 9 are followed by 5 (position 10). So why are they not replaced? Hmm. That theory doesn't hold.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the output rows, the 2s only appear in certain positions. Perhaps the 0s are replaced with 2s if they are part of a certain pattern in the input. For example, maybe they are the fourth and fifth elements in a row. Wait in Example 0's fifth row, the replaced 0s are at positions 5 and 6 (0-based), which are the sixth and seventh elements. But in other examples, like Example 1's row 3 input, the replaced 0s start at position 6, which is the seventh element. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement occurs in specific columns. For example, columns 5 and 6 (0-based) are replaced. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth row (input index 5), the replaced 0s are at positions 5 and 6 (columns 5 and 6). In Example 0's sixth row (input index 6), the replaced 0s are at positions 0-1 (columns 0-1) and positions 5-6. So that's different columns. So columns vary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement occurs every time two 0s are surrounded by 5s. For example, in Example 0's fifth row, the 0s at 5 and 6 are between 5 (position 4) and 5 (position 7). But in the same row, the 0s at 8 and 9 are between 5 (position7) and 5 (position10). So why are they not replaced? Because the surrounding elements are 5, but the output leaves them as 0. So that theory doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for pairs of 0s that are part of a larger block of 0s. Like, if there's a run of three or more 0s, then the middle ones become 2s. But in Example 0's fifth row, the replaced 0s are a pair, not part of a longer run.\n\nHmm. Let's try to find another approach. Maybe the transformation is to look at each row and replace certain sequences. For instance, replace every second occurrence of \"0,0\" with \"2,2\". Or perhaps replace the first occurrence, but the examples show multiple replacements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to the 0s that are in the same positions as in certain patterns in the input. For example, the first two 0s in a row that are followed by a 5. But this is getting too vague.\n\nWait, let's look at the test input. The user provided test input, and I need to apply the pattern to it. Maybe the answer is to replace every pair of 0s with 2s. But that's not the case in the training examples. For example, in Example 0's fifth row, there are two pairs of 0s (positions 5-6 and 8-9), but only the first pair is replaced. So there must be another condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement occurs when a pair of 0s is followed by a 5, and preceded by a 5. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's fifth row, the replaced 0s (positions 5-6) are preceded by 5 (position4) and followed by 5 (position7). So maybe that's the condition. Let's check another example.\n\nIn Example 1's third input row: [5,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0], the output changes the first three 0s to 2s. The first two 0s are at positions 6 and7, followed by two more 0s, then followed by 5. The first three 0s are replaced with 2s. Wait, the input is [0,0,0,0], and the output is [2,2,2,0]. So perhaps the first three 0s are replaced. But how does that fit into the pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to replace every other pair of 0s. Like, first pair remains 0, second becomes 2. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's list the positions where 0s are replaced with 2s in the examples.\n\nExample 0:\n\nRow 5 (input index5): 0s at positions 5 and 6 \u2192 2,2.\nRow 6 (input index6): 0s at 0-1 and 5-6 \u2192 replaced with 2s.\nRow7: 0s at 0-1 and 14-15 \u2192 2s.\nRow8: 0s at 14-15 \u2192 2s.\nRow13: 0s at 5-6 \u2192 2s.\nRow16: 0s at 4-5 and 13-14 \u2192 2s.\nRow17: 0s at 4-5 \u2192 2s.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow1: 0s at positions 13-14 \u2192 2s.\nRow2: 0s at 12-13 \u2192 2s.\nRow3: 0s at6-8 \u2192 replaced with 2s.\nRow4: 0s at6-8 \u2192 replaced with 2s.\nRow5: 0s at11-12 \u2192 2s.\nRow6: 0s at10-11 \u2192 2s.\nRow15: 0s at6-7 \u2192 2s.\nRow16: 0s at2-3 and 6-7 \u2192 2s.\nRow17: 0s at2-3 \u2192 2s.\n\nExample2:\n\nRow1: 0s at6-7 \u2192 2s.\nRow2: 0s at6-7 \u2192 2s.\nRow4: 0s at14-15 \u2192 2s.\nRow5: 0s at15-16 \u2192 2s.\nRow7: 0s at10-11 \u2192 2s.\nRow8: 0s at10-11 \u2192 2s.\nRow9: 0s at10-11 \u2192 2s.\nRow10: 0s at10-11 \u2192 2s.\n\nLooking at these, it seems that the 0s are replaced with 2s when they are consecutive and appear in certain positions. But there's a pattern in the training examples where the replacement happens in pairs, but the positions vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for every pair of consecutive 0s that are in even-numbered positions (0-based). Or perhaps in the middle of the list.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's row5, the replaced 0s are at positions 5 and6. In a list of 18 elements, positions 5 and6 are towards the middle. Example0's row6, replaced 0s at 0-1 and5-6. Example0's row7: replaced 0s at 0-1 and14-15. So not sure about positions.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the replacement is done when the pair of 0s is preceded by a certain number of 5s. For example, in Example0's row5, the replaced 0s are after four 5s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to the pairs of 0s that are in columns 5-6, 0-1, 14-15, etc., but that doesn't form a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is treated as a grid, and the replacement is done for certain patterns. For example, in a 3x6 grid or 6x3, but the length of each row is 18, which factors into 3x6 or 6x3. If each row is divided into 3x6, then perhaps certain cells in the grid have their 0s replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced in every third position. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for a rule that applies to all the examples. For instance, whenever there are two or more consecutive 0s, the first occurrence of two 0s is replaced with 2s, and the rest remain. But in Example1's row3, four 0s are replaced with three 2s and a 0, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in Example1's row3 input, the four 0s at positions6-9 are replaced with three 2s and one 0. So the input is [0,0,0,0], output [2,2,2,0]. That's replacing three 0s with 2s, which doesn't fit a pair. Maybe the rule is to replace all consecutive 0s except the last one. For example, in a group of four 0s, replace the first three with 2s. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is for any occurrence of two or more 0s, and all of them are replaced with 2s. But in some cases, like Example0's row5, two 0s are replaced, while in Example1's row3, four 0s are replaced with three 2s and a 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the parity of the number of 0s in a group. For example, even groups get all replaced, odd groups have one remaining. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the position of the 0s in the entire list. For example, every even-indexed pair of 0s is replaced. But the examples don't support this.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's look for another angle. What if the transformation is to replace pairs of 0s with 2s only if they are not at the very beginning or end of the row? Or perhaps the opposite.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that in each row, the first two 0s are replaced with 2s, the next two stay as 0s, and so on. But in Example0's row5, there are two pairs, and the first is replaced, the second isn't. So that could fit. Let's check another example.\n\nExample0's row6 input: [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5]. The output replaces the first two pairs (0,0 and 0,0) with 2,2. So the first two pairs are replaced, the next three 0s (positions8,10,11) are single 0s and a pair. But the output shows [2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5]. So the third pair (positions10-11) is not replaced. So this doesn't fit the first two pairs theory.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is to replace all pairs of 0s except those at the end of the row. But in Example0's row7, the input ends with [5,0,0,5], and the output has [5,2,2,5]. So the end pair is replaced. So that theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the replacement is done for pairs of 0s that are flanked by 5s on both sides. For example, in Example0's row5, the 0s at positions5-6 are between 5 (position4) and 5 (position7). Similarly, in row6, the 0s at positions0-1 are preceded by nothing (start of list) and followed by 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for pairs of 0s that are not part of a longer run. So, two 0s alone are replaced, but if there are three or more, only part of them are replaced. But in Example1's row3, four 0s become three 2s and a 0, which is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is to replace any pair of 0s with 2s, but only if they are in the same \"block\" of the list. For example, considering the list divided into blocks of three elements. If a pair of 0s is within a block, replace them. But this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is to replace every second occurrence of 0s in a row. But the examples don't show a clear pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that the 0s are replaced with 2s in positions where they form a certain shape when the list is viewed as a grid. For example, each row is 18 elements long. Maybe arranged as a 3x6 grid. Then, replacing 0s in certain rows or columns. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the number 2 could be a sum or product of adjacent elements, but since the input is 0s and 5s, adding two 5s would give 10, which doesn't fit. So that's unlikely.\n\nWait, another observation: in all training examples, the output is almost the same as the input except for certain 0s replaced with 2s. So the transformation is minimal. The key is to find which 0s to replace.\n\nLooking at the test input, perhaps the replacement happens when two 0s are next to each other and the previous element is a 5. For example, in Example0's row5, the 0s at positions5-6 are preceded by a 5 (position4). Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0's row6: the first pair of 0s is at the start of the row, so preceded by nothing. The next pair is at positions5-6, preceded by 5 (position4). Both are replaced. So the rule could be that pairs of 0s preceded by a 5 are replaced. But then the first pair in row6 is replaced even though there's nothing before them, which contradicts the rule.\n\nAlternatively, pairs of 0s that are followed by a 5. In Example0's row5, the pair is followed by 5. In row6, the first pair is followed by 5 (position2), but the second pair (positions5-6) is followed by 5 (position7). Both are replaced. So perhaps that's the condition. Let's check another example.\n\nExample1's row3 input: the replaced 0s are followed by 5s. The first three 0s are followed by another 0, then a 5. So the first three 0s are replaced with 2s but are followed by a 0, which contradicts the theory.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's try to find a different approach. Maybe the replacement is done for pairs of 0s that are in certain positions based on their index in the row. For example, every 6th and 7th element, or something like that. Let's look at the positions where replacements happened in the training examples.\n\nExample0 row5: replaced at 5,6\nExample0 row6: 0,1 and5,6\nExample0 row7: 0,1 and14,15\nExample0 row8:14,15\nExample0 row13:5,6\nExample0 row16:4,5 and13,14\nExample0 row17:4,5\n\nExample1 row1:13,14\nExample1 row2:12,13\nExample1 row3:6,7,8 (replaced three 0s)\nExample1 row4:6,7,8\nExample1 row5:11,12\nExample1 row6:10,11\nExample1 row15:6,7\nExample1 row16:2,3 and6,7\nExample1 row17:2,3\n\nExample2 row1:6,7\nExample2 row2:6,7\nExample2 row4:14,15\nExample2 row5:15,16\nExample2 row7:10,11\nExample2 row8:10,11\nExample2 row9:10,11\nExample2 row10:10,11\n\nLooking at these indices, perhaps there's a pattern where the replaced pairs are in positions that are multiples of 6. For example, positions 6, 12, 18, etc. But the replaced positions vary. For example, in Example1 row2, positions12-13 are replaced, which are 12 and13. Not exactly multiples of 6.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each row is 18 elements long (0-17), perhaps the middle two elements (positions8 and9) are replaced if they are 0s. But in Example0's row5, the replaced positions are5-6, which are not the middle.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the replacement occurs in every third pair of consecutive 0s. But without a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, think of the row as being divided into groups of three elements. If a group has two 0s, replace them with 2s. For example, a group like [0,0,5] would become [2,2,5]. But looking at Example0 row5's first group [0,5,5], which doesn't have two 0s. The second group [5,5,0], which has one 0. The third group [0,5,0], which has two 0s but not consecutive. So this theory doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is for pairs of 0s that are at even positions. For example, positions 0-1, 2-3, etc. But in Example0 row5, the replaced positions are5-6 (odd-even), which would not fit.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the replaced 0s are usually in pairs and often in the middle or towards the end of the rows. For the test input, I'll need to identify where pairs of 0s are present and replace them with 2s. But according to the training examples, not all pairs are replaced, so there must be a specific condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for every second occurrence of a pair of 0s in the row, or pairs that are preceded by a certain number of 5s.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed to hypothesize that any pair of consecutive 0s in the input is replaced with 2s. Even though there are exceptions in the training examples, perhaps there's a different rule.\n\nWait, looking back at Example0's row5 input: [0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0]. The output has two pairs replaced. But the first pair (0,0) becomes (2,2), and the second pair (0,0) becomes (0,0). So why is the first pair replaced but not the second? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is only for pairs of 0s that are preceded by an even number of 5s. Or some other condition.\n\nAnother possibility: the replacement is done for pairs of 0s that are part of a larger group of 0s. For example, if there's a group of 3 or more 0s, replace the middle ones. But the examples show varying results.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is based on the sum of the elements in the row. For instance, if the sum is even or odd. But this is unlikely.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll look for a pattern in the replaced pairs' positions. For example, in Example0's row5, the replaced pair is at positions5-6. In row6, replaced pairs are at0-1 and5-6. In row7, pairs at0-1 and14-15. In row8, pair at14-15. In row13, pair at5-6. Row16, pairs at4-5 and13-14. Row17, pair at4-5. \n\nLooking at these positions, perhaps the replaced pairs are at indices (5,6) and (4,5), (14,15), etc. Is there a pattern to these indices? 5+6=11, 4+5=9, 14+15=29. Not sure. Alternatively, the positions are 5-6, which is the sixth and seventh elements (1-based), maybe related to some pattern. \n\nAlternatively, each row is divided into three parts: left, middle, right. The replaced pairs are in the middle part. For example, in a row of 18 elements, the middle third (positions6-11) might be where replacements occur. But in Example0 row5, the replaced pair is at5-6 (just before the middle third). Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0, the replaced pairs are often in the same columns across multiple rows. For example, columns5-6 (positions5-6) are replaced in rows5,6,13. Columns0-1 are replaced in row6,7. Columns14-15 in rows7,8. Columns4-5 in rows16,17. So there's a pattern of certain columns being replaced. \n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps the rule is to replace pairs of 0s in specific columns. For example, columns5-6, 0-1, 4-5, 13-14,14-15, etc. But how to determine which columns? \n\nLooking at the training examples, the columns where replacements happen vary, but there's a possibility that they are at certain intervals. For instance, every sixth column. But columns0-1,5-6, etc., don't follow a clear interval.\n\nAlternatively, the columns could be based on their position modulo 6. For example, columns5-6 (5 mod 6 is5, 6 mod6 is0). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replaced pairs are in columns that are multiples of 5. For example, columns5-6, which are near 5. But columns0-1 (0) and 14-15 (14) don't fit.\n\nThis line of thinking isn't leading me anywhere. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps the replacement is based on the number of 5s before the pair of 0s. For example, if there are three 5s before the pair, replace them. But again, this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that pairs of 0s are replaced with 2s if they are not at the start or end of the row and are surrounded by 5s. But given the examples where this isn't the case, this may not be accurate. However, considering the test input, perhaps I'll apply this rule.\n\nAlternatively, since all the replaced pairs in the examples are consecutive 0s, perhaps in the test input, every pair of consecutive 0s should be replaced with 2s. But looking at the training examples, this isn't the case. For example, in Example0's row5, there are two pairs, but only the first is replaced. So the rule must be more complex.\n\nAnother possibility: the replacement is done for pairs of 0s that are part of a larger sequence where the first two 0s are replaced. For example, if there are four consecutive 0s, the first two are replaced with 2s, the next two remain. But in Example1's row3, four 0s become three 2s and one 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is done for every even-numbered pair of 0s. For example, the second pair, fourth pair, etc. But the examples don't clearly show this.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following approach: in each row of the test input, look for pairs of consecutive 0s and replace them with 2s. Even though this doesn't fit all training examples, it's a possible pattern.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example0's row5 input: [0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0]. The output replaces the first pair of 0s (positions5-6) and leaves the second pair. If the rule is to replace all pairs, this doesn't fit. So perhaps the rule is to replace the first occurrence of two 0s in a row.\n\nBut in Example0's row6, there are two pairs replaced. So that theory is invalid.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the replacement is done in pairs that are not overlapping. For example, if a row has multiple pairs, replace every other pair. Or replace pairs starting from the left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for pairs of 0s that are followed by a 5. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's row5: the pair at5-6 is followed by5 (position7). The next pair at8-9 is followed by5 (position10). So both are followed by5, but only the first is replaced. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, preceded by a 5. The first pair in row5 is preceded by5 (position4), the second pair is preceded by5 (position7). So both are preceded by5, but only the first is replaced. So that's not it.\n\nAnother possibility: the replacement is done for pairs of 0s that have exactly three 5s before them. Or some other count. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll have to make a best guess. Observing the examples, it seems that the replacement occurs for certain pairs of 0s that are in the middle of the row or in specific positions. For the test input, I'll look for pairs of 0s and replace them with 2s, assuming that the pattern is to replace all such pairs. Even though this may not fit all training examples, it's a plausible approach.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nLooking for consecutive 0s:\n\n- Positions0-1-2: three 0s. But in the training examples, sometimes three 0s are replaced with three 2s. For example, Example1's row3, four 0s become three 2s and one 0. So maybe the first two or three are replaced.\n\nBut I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps every pair of 0s is replaced. So in row0 of the test input, the first three 0s would be replaced as 0,0,0 \u2192 2,2,0? Or 2,2,2?\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed to replace all pairs of 0s with 2s.\n\nBut looking back, in Example0's row5, the first pair is replaced, the second isn't. So perhaps only the first occurrence is replaced.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I'll proceed with replacing every pair of consecutive 0s in the test input with 2s and see if that matches the expected pattern.\n\nFor example, in the test input's first row:\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nConsecutive 0s:\n\n- Positions0-1-2: three 0s. If we replace pairs, perhaps first two are 2s, third remains. So becomes [2,2,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. But in the training examples, when there are three 0s, sometimes they're replaced with three 2s. So this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, replace all pairs. So three 0s become 2,2,0. Then the pair at positions6-7 (0,0) becomes 2,2. The pair at positions16-17 becomes 2,2.\n\nSo the first row would become [2,2,0,5,0,5,2,2,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,2,2].\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the training examples, perhaps only certain pairs are replaced. For example, in Example0's row5, the pair at positions5-6 is replaced. So in the test input's first row, the pair at positions6-7 (0,0) would be replaced. Also, the pair at 0-1 would be replaced. But since there are three 0s, perhaps the first two are replaced, and the third remains.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the examples, I'll proceed to replace all pairs of consecutive 0s with 2s, even if they are part of a longer run. For example, three 0s would become 2,2,0. This seems to fit some training examples.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFirst row: [0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nReplace pairs:\n\n- 0,0 \u2192 2,2 (positions0-1), remaining 0 at position2.\n\n- Then, position2 is 0, followed by 5, so no pair.\n\n- Next pair is positions6-7: 0,0 \u2192 2,2.\n\n- Last pair positions16-17: 0,0 \u21922,2.\n\nSo the first row becomes [2,2,0,5,0,5,2,2,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,2,2].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, for example, in Example0's row6, three consecutive 0s are replaced with 2,2. So maybe the first two are replaced. But in Example1's row3, four 0s become three 2s and one 0, which is unclear.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll proceed with replacing all pairs of consecutive 0s with 2s, even if overlapping. For example, in a group of three 0s, replace positions0-1 to 2,2, and then 1-2 (now 2,0) would not be a pair. So the result would be 2,2,0.\n\nApplying this to the test input rows.\n\nLet's take the first row of the test input:\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nReplace consecutive pairs:\n\n- positions0-1: replace with 2,2 \u2192 [2,2,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\n- next pair at positions2-3: 0 and5 \u2192 no.\n\n- pair at positions4-5: 0 and5 \u2192 no.\n\n- pair at positions6-7: 0,0 \u2192 2,2 \u2192 [2,2,0,5,0,5,2,2,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\n- pair at positions16-17: 0,0 \u2192 2,2 \u2192 final row becomes [2,2,0,5,0,5,2,2,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,2,2]\n\nBut in the training examples, sometimes pairs in the middle are replaced, sometimes at the ends. So this approach might be correct.\n\nProceeding with this method for all test input rows.",
