        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the input grids and see how they're transformed into the output grids. The outputs have some 2s added, so the key is to determine under what conditions the original 0s or 1s are changed to 2s.\n\nLooking at the training examples:\n\nIn Example 0, the output has 2s in certain positions. Let me compare the input and output. The 2s seem to form some sort of path or maybe areas adjacent to certain 1s. For instance, in row 4 (0-based index?), the input has [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], and the output changes the second and third elements to 2, making [0,2,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]. Similarly, in row 5 of the input, there's a 0 that becomes 2. \n\nWait, maybe it's about proximity to 1s but only in certain directions. Or perhaps it's a flooding or filling mechanism. Another thought: maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are between two 1s in some way. Or maybe they're marking cells that are adjacent to 1s but only in specific rows or columns.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output has 2s in the leftmost columns. For instance, in row 3, the first two 0s become 2s. Similarly, rows 4 and 5 have 2s. But in the input, those positions are 0. How are they chosen?\n\nAnother angle: maybe the 2s are filling regions that are enclosed by 1s. But in the first example, the 2s are near the left edge but not surrounded. Alternatively, perhaps the 2s are in cells that are part of a \"valley\" or a path that connects certain regions.\n\nWait, looking at the positions of 2s in Example 0's output: row 4 columns 1 and 2 (assuming zero-based), row 5 columns 1,2,3. So maybe it's a matter of cells that are adjacent (including diagonally?) to certain 1s but only in specific parts of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are cells that are in the same row as some 1s but are to the left of them. For example, in Example 0, row 4 has 1s starting at column 4. The 2s are in columns 1 and 2. But that might not fit all cases.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, in row 3, columns 1 and 2 are 2s. The input here had 0s. The 1s in that row start at column 5. So maybe the 2s are placed in cells that are to the left of the first 1 in each row? Let's check. In Example 0, row 4: the first 1 is at column 4 (0-based), and the 2s are columns 1 and 2. That's to the left. But in row 5 of Example 0's input, the first 1 is at column 4 again. The 2s in output row 5 are columns 1,2,3. So maybe the rule is that in each row, starting from the left, the 0s before the first 1 are turned into 2s up to a certain point. But that doesn't explain why some rows have 2s and others don't.\n\nWait, maybe it's not per row. Let's look at Example 2's output. In row 3, column 1 is 2. The input here has 0s. The 1s in row 3 start at column 4. So again, 2 is to the left. But in some rows, like row 4 of Example 2's output, there are 2s at columns 1 and 3, which are 0s in the input. But the first 1 in that row is column 4 again. So columns before the first 1 are 2s. But in row 5 of Example 2's input, the first 1 is at column 5 (since the row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]). The output has 2s in columns 1-4. So that's all the 0s before the first 1 (column 5) become 2s. Oh, that seems to fit. So perhaps the pattern is that in each row, all the 0s that are to the left of the first 1 (i.e., before the first occurrence of 1) are converted to 2s.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nTake Example 0's input row 4: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]. The first 1 is at index 4. The 0s before that (indices 0-3) would be converted to 2s. But in the output, row 4 is [0,2,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]. So indices 1 and 2 are 2, but indices 0 and 3 remain 0. That contradicts the idea. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a path that starts from the bottom or top and moves left. Alternatively, maybe it's a cellular automaton rule where 0s adjacent to certain numbers of 1s become 2s. Or perhaps 0s that are adjacent (maybe diagonally) to exactly two 1s.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output row 4, the 2s are at positions 1 and 2. Looking at their neighbors in the input:\n\nFor position (4,1) in input: it's 0. Its neighbors could be looking at adjacent cells. Let's see:\n\nIn input, (4,1) has neighbors above, below, left, right, and diagonals. The input row 4 is [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]. So the cells to the right are 0,0, then 1. The cell (4,1) is in the middle of 0s. Maybe the rule is that a 0 becomes 2 if it's adjacent to a 1 in a certain direction. Alternatively, maybe it's based on the number of 1s in neighboring cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about filling regions that are connected to the left edge. But in Example 0, the leftmost column has 0s except for row 4 and 5. Wait, the 2s in Example 0's output are in rows 4,5,6. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the test input, perhaps the 2s are placed in cells that form a sort of \"shadow\" or path leading to certain 1s. Maybe the 2s are filling in the leftmost possible path that connects the 1s in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are cells that are reachable by moving left from some 1s. For example, if there's a 1, and to the left of it are 0s, those 0s become 2s. But in Example 0, row 4 has 1s starting at column 4, and the 0s to the left (columns 0-3) would be converted, but in the output, only columns 1 and 2 are 2s. So maybe not all of them.\n\nWait, maybe the 2s are in cells that are between two 1s in some direction. For example, if a cell is between two 1s vertically or horizontally. But looking at the examples, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 2s as being part of a minimal spanning tree connecting certain 1s, but that seems complex.\n\nAnother approach: Compare each input row and output row to see the transformation.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow 4 input: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nOutput: [0,2,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nSo positions 1 and 2 (0-based) are turned into 2s. The 0s here are adjacent to which 1s? The first 1 in the row is at position 4. The positions 1 and 2 are to the left of that. Maybe the 2s are the first two 0s to the left of the first 1 in the row. But in row 5 of Example 0's input: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0], the first 1 is at position 4. The output row 5 is [0,2,2,2,1,1,0,1,1,0]. So the 0s at positions 1,2,3 are turned into 2s. So that's three 0s to the left of the first 1. Hmm. So maybe the rule is that in each row, all the 0s before the first 1 are turned into 2s. But in the first example's row 4, the first 1 is at column 4. The 0s before it are columns 0-3. But in the output, columns 1 and 2 are 2s, but 0 and 3 remain 0. That contradicts. So that can't be the rule.\n\nWait, maybe the first occurrence of 1 in the row is at column X, and the 2s are in positions (X-3) to (X-1). But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are cells that are adjacent to the first 1 in the row. For example, if the first 1 is at position X, then the 0s at positions X-1, X-2, etc., become 2s. But again, in Example 0's row 4, the first 1 is at 4. X-1 is 3, X-2 is 2, etc. The output has 2s at 1 and 2. So maybe up to two positions before? Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's row 3 input: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1]. The first 1 is at position 5. The output row 3 has 2s at positions 1 and 2. But the positions before 5 (0-4) are 0s. So why are only 1 and 2 converted? Maybe there's another factor.\n\nPerhaps the 2s are determined based on columns rather than rows. Let's look at columns. In Example 0's output, the 2s are in columns 1,2,3 in rows 4,5,6. Maybe columns that are to the left of the leftmost 1 in their respective rows. But how does that vary per row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s form a vertical line connecting certain 1s. For example, in Example 0's output, there's a vertical line of 2s in columns 1 and 2 starting from row 4 down to row 6. Maybe the 2s are part of a path that connects the 1s in some way.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look for the positions where 2s are introduced. In all examples, 2s are placed in regions that are contiguous and form a kind of vertical or diagonal line. For instance, in Example 0's output, rows 4-6 have 2s in columns 1-3. Maybe these 2s are part of a path that starts from the leftmost 1 in the bottom or top.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are cells that are part of the \"left border\" of the 1s. For example, in the input, the 1s form certain shapes, and the 2s are the leftmost edge of those shapes. But in Example 0's input, the 1s are in the middle, and the 2s are to the left of them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are cells that are part of a maze-like path that connects from the left edge to some 1s. For example, if you start from the left edge and move right, whenever there's a 1 in that row, the path leads to it by turning 0s into 2s. But how would that work across rows?\n\nAlternatively, think of the 2s as marking the path of least resistance from the left edge to the main body of 1s. For example, in Example 0, the 2s in row 4 and 5 form a path that connects from the left to the 1s in the middle.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the 2s start at row 4, column 1 and 2. Then row 5, columns 1-3. Row 6, column 1. Then in row 7, they disappear. So maybe it's a diagonal path from row 4 to row 6.\n\nBut how is that determined from the input? The input in those rows has 1s starting at column 4. Maybe the algorithm is to find a path from the leftmost possible to the 1s, turning those 0s into 2s. But the exact path selection is unclear.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the number of 2s in each example. In Example 0's output, the 2s are clustered in the middle-left. In Example 1, they form vertical lines on the left side. In Example 2, they are in a more diagonal pattern. So perhaps the 2s are forming a kind of outline or boundary around the 1s.\n\nWait, maybe the 2s are cells that are adjacent to 1s and also adjacent to the left edge. But in Example 1, the 2s are in the second column, not adjacent to the left edge. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 2s as marking cells that are part of the convex hull or some other geometric feature of the 1s' arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the 2s are the result of a flood fill starting from certain 1s. For example, maybe starting from a specific 1 and filling all connected 0s to the left with 2s. But how to determine which 1 is the starting point.\n\nLooking at the test input, perhaps the 2s would be placed in certain columns to the left of the first 1 in each row. Let's check the test input rows:\n\nTest input row 0: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0] \u2013 first 1 is at column 4. So maybe 0s before column 4 (columns 0-3) would become 2s. But in the output, perhaps row 0 remains all 0s except the 1.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0] \u2013 first 1 is at column 2. So 0s before column 2 (columns 0-1) become 2s? But the output might have 0s here. Wait, but in Example 0's first row, the first 1 is at column 3 (input row 1 is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]), and the output row 1 is the same as input. So no 2s there. So that contradicts the per-row left 0s to 2s idea.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's check if the 2s are added in positions where a cell is 0, and there are 1s both above and below it in the same column. Let's look at Example 0's output. For example, column 1 in row 4: there's a 2. Looking at the input, in column 1, rows above and below:\n\nRow 3: 0 in column 1.\n\nRow 5: 0 in column 1 (input) but in output, it's a 2. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a 0 becomes a 2 if it's adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to at least two 1s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's row 4, column 1: input is 0. Adjacent cells: up is row 3, column 1 which is 0. Down is row 5, column 1 which is 0. Left is column 0, row 4: 0. Right is column 2, row 4: 0. So no adjacent 1s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe another pattern: the 2s are in cells that form a path connecting certain 1s from the left edge. For example, in Example 0's output, the 2s start near the left edge and snake down to connect with the 1s. Maybe it's a shortest path algorithm that turns 0s into 2s along the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in cells that are part of a left-hand maze solving path. But this is getting too vague.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern between the input and output for each example.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nThe 2s appear in rows 4,5,6, columns 1,2,3. Let's look at those cells in the input. The input for those positions are 0s, but what's around them. For example, row 4, column 1 in input is 0. The cell to the right (column 2) is 0, column 3 is 0, column 4 is 1. So maybe the 2s are to the left of the 1s in their row, but only a certain number of steps.\n\nWait, in row 4 of Example 0, the first 1 is at column 4. The 2s are in columns 1 and 2. Column 3 is 0. So why not column 3? Maybe there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in cells that are part of a vertical line that's adjacent to the leftmost 1 in their row. For example, if the first 1 in the row is at column X, then the cells in the same row and columns X-3 to X-1 are turned into 2s. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in cells that are part of the minimal rectangle enclosing all the 1s. But in Example 0, the 1s are spread out, so the minimal rectangle would include many cells, but not sure how that leads to 2s.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compare the positions of 2s in the outputs and see if they form a specific shape or follow a mathematical rule.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 2s form two vertical lines in the left part. For example, in rows 3-7, columns 1 and 2 are 2s. But row 5 has 2s in columns 1-4. So it's a wider area. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input row 5 is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1]. The output is [0,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1]. So all the 0s before the first 1 are turned into 2s. Wait, this fits. The first 1 is at column 5. The 0s in columns 0-4 are all turned into 2s. But in the output row 5, columns 0 is 0, columns 1-4 are 2s. Wait, the output row 5 is [0,2,2,2,2, ...]. So column 0 remains 0. Oh, so maybe the rule is: in each row, replace all 0s to the left of the first 1 with 2s, except for the first column (column 0). But in Example 0's row 5 input: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0]. The first 1 is at column 4. The output row 5 is [0,2,2,2,1,1,0,1,1,0]. So columns 1-3 are 2s. Column 0 remains 0. That fits the rule: replace all 0s to the left of first 1 with 2s, except column 0.\n\nWait, that seems to fit for these examples. Let's check others.\n\nExample 1's row 3 input: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1]. The first 1 is at column 5. The output row 3 is [0,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,1]. So columns 1 and 2 are 2s. But according to the rule, columns 0-4 should be 2s except column 0. But in the output, columns 1 and 2 are 2s, but columns 3 and 4 remain 0. So this contradicts the rule.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the rule isn't that straightforward.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input row 3: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1]. The first 1 is at column 4. The output row 3 is [0,2,0,0,1, ...]. Columns 1 is 2, others before first 1 are 0. So that doesn't fit the previous idea.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the 2s are placed in positions that are to the left of the first 1 in the row and also adjacent to a 1 in the column below or above.\n\nFor instance, in Example 0's row 4, column 1: there's a 2. If we look at the column below (row 5, column 1), the input has 0, but the output has 2. Maybe there's a vertical connection. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the minimal changes between input and output. The only changes are 0s turning into 2s. So the pattern is about which 0s become 2s.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nIn row 4, columns 1 and 2 become 2s. The input in those positions are 0. Let's see their neighboring cells in the input. For row 4, column 1:\n\n- North: row 3, column 1 is 0.\n\n- South: row 5, column 1 is 0.\n\n- East: column 2 is 0.\n\n- West: column 0 is 0.\n\nNo 1s adjacent here.\n\nBut maybe it's about being in a certain region. For example, the 2s form a vertical strip to the left of the 1s cluster.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are the result of a specific algorithm, like a maze solver that turns certain 0s into 2s when moving from left to right, following the 1s.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 2s as markers for the leftmost contiguous block of 0s that are between two 1s vertically. For example, if there's a 1 in a higher row and a lower row, the 0s between them in the same column become 2s.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 4, column 1 and 2: is there a 1 above and below? Row 3, column 1 is 0. Row 5, column 1 is 0. So no.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLet me consider the test input and see what the output would look like if the same pattern as the examples is followed.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking for where the 2s might be placed based on the examples.\n\nIn Example 0, 2s are in the middle-left area. In Example 1, vertical lines on the left. In Example 2, a diagonal path.\n\nAssuming the pattern is similar to Example 0, the test input's 2s might be in rows 4-6, columns 1-3.\n\nBut let's think of possible rules again.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The 2s are in cells where, in the input, the cell is 0, and there exists a path to the left edge of the grid through other 0s, and also the cell is adjacent to a 1. Maybe it's like a region of 0s connected to the left edge and adjacent to 1s.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the 2s are in the middle-left. Are those cells connected to the left edge via 0s? For example, in row 4, column 1: to get to the left edge (column 0), you'd need to move left from column 1, which is 0. So yes. But why are those cells turned into 2s but not others. Maybe because they're adjacent to 1s. For row 4, column 1 is adjacent to column 4's 1 in the same row. Wait, no. The 1 in row 4 starts at column 4. So column 1 is not adjacent to any 1.\n\nHmm. This is really tricky.\n\nAlternative idea: The 2s are cells that are part of a \"left lobe\" of the 1s structure. For example, in Example 0, the 1s form a sort of shape, and the 2s are filling the left part of that shape. But it's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: Let's count the number of 2s added in each example. Example 0 has 2s added in rows 4,5,6. Example 1 in rows 3-7. Example 2 in rows 3-7. Perhaps the 2s are added in a certain vertical range relative to the positions of the 1s.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are added in cells that are in the same column as the first occurrence of 1 in their row and the columns to the left. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a pattern in the columns where 2s appear. In Example 0, 2s are in columns 1-3. In Example 1, columns 1-4. In Example 2, columns 1-4. So maybe the columns depend on how far the first 1 is in the row.\n\nFor example, if the first 1 in a row is at column X, then the 2s are in columns from X - 3 to X -1. Or something like that. But in Example 0's row 4, X=4. So X-3=1, X-1=3. The 2s are in columns 1 and 2. So maybe the first two columns before X. But in Example 1's row 3, X=5. So X-3=2, X-1=4. The 2s are in columns 1 and 2, which is less than the calculation.\n\nThis doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother observation: In all the outputs, the 2s are never in the first column (column 0). So column 0 is always 0. Perhaps the rule is to replace all 0s from column 1 up to (but not including) the first 1 in each row. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's row 4: first 1 at column 4. Columns 1-3 would be 2s. Output row 4: columns 1-2 are 2s, column 3 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample 1's row 5: first 1 at column 5. Columns 1-4 would be 2s. Output row 5 has columns 1-4 as 2s, which fits.\n\nExample 2's row 5: first 1 at column 5. Output row 5 has columns 1-4 as 2s. Which fits. But other rows may not.\n\nSo maybe the rule is that in each row, starting from column 1 up to the column just before the first 1, replace all 0s with 2s. But then why in Example 0's row 4, only columns 1 and 2 are 2s. Because the first 1 is at column 4. So columns 1-3 would be replaced. But in the output, only columns 1-2 are 2s. Hmm. Maybe there's an exception when there's a 0 in the path. Or perhaps the replacement stops at certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is to replace the first two 0s in the row (starting from column 1) with 2s if they are before the first 1. But that doesn't fit all cases.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is to replace the 0s in the row from column 1 up to two columns before the first 1. For example, if first 1 is at X, replace columns 1 to X-2. But in Example 0's row 4, X=4. X-2=2. So columns 1-2 are replaced. Which fits. In Example 1's row 5, X=5. X-2=3. So columns 1-3 would be replaced, but in the output, columns 1-4 are 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to see if there's a connection between the input and output in terms of the positions of 2s and 1s.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 2s are adjacent to each other forming a connected region. Perhaps the 2s are regions that are connected to each other and adjacent to 1s. For example, in row 4, the 2s are next to the 1s. But no, in row 4, the 2s are in columns 1 and 2, and the 1s start at column 4.\n\nAnother idea: The 2s are placed in cells that are part of a horizontal line that starts from the left and stops when a 1 is encountered. For example, in each row, starting from column 0, move right until you hit a 1, and all 0s from column 1 up to that point become 2s. But column 0 remains 0.\n\nWait, let's check Example 1's row 5: input is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1]. Output is [0,2,2,2,2,1, ...]. So columns 1-4 are 2s. Which fits this rule. The first 1 is at column 5. So from column 1 to 4, replace with 2s.\n\nExample 0's row 5 input: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0]. First 1 is at column 4. So columns 1-3 should be 2s. Output is [0,2,2,2,1,1,...]. Which fits.\n\nExample 0's row 4 input: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]. First 1 is at column 4. So columns 1-3 should be 2s. Output row 4 is [0,2,2,0,1,...]. Column 3 is 0. So why isn't column 3 a 2? This is a discrepancy. What's different here?\n\nLooking at row 4's input: after the first 1 at column 4, the rest are 1s. So perhaps the rule applies only when there's a 1 after some 0s. Or maybe there's another condition.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that in each row, starting from column 1, replace all 0s with 2s until the first occurrence of 1, but stop if there's a 0 after some 1s. For example, in row 4 of Example 0, after the first 1, there are more 1s. So columns 1-3 are replaced. But in the output, column 3 is 0. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a vertical component. For example, a cell becomes 2 if it's a 0 in the current row and the cell below it is a 2. But in Example 0's row 4, the cells below (row 5) have 2s in columns 1-3. So row 4's columns 1-3 would become 2s. But in the output, row 4's column 3 is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the 2s are the result of a certain cellular automaton rule. For example, a 0 becomes 2 if it has exactly two 1s in its Moore neighborhood. But again, checking Example 0's row 4, column 1 has no 1s adjacent, so that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are cells that are part of a path that starts from the first 1 in the bottom row and moves leftwards and upwards. But this is speculative.\n\nAt this point, I think the most consistent pattern across the examples is that in each row, starting from column 1, replace all 0s with 2s up to the column just before the first 1. However, there's a case in Example 0's row 4 where this doesn't happen. Let's re-examine that.\n\nExample 0's row 4 input: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]. The first 1 is at column 4. So columns 1-3 should be 2s. But the output is [0,2,2,0,1,...]. So column 3 remains 0. Why?\n\nLooking at the input for row 4, column 3 is 0. The output leaves it as 0. Why? Maybe there's an exception when the first 1 is at column 4, but only columns 1 and 2 are replaced. Or perhaps there's a different rule for certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 2s per row depends on the row index. For example, in row 4, replace two columns, row 5 replace three columns, etc. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in cells that are to the left of the first 1 in their row and also part of a vertical group. For instance, in Example 0's row 4-5, the 2s form vertical lines. But how this is determined.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's consider the test input and try to predict the output based on the examples' possible patterns.\n\nTest input row 4 is [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]. The first 1 is at column 4. If the rule is to replace all 0s from column 1 up to column 3 with 2s, then the output row 4 would be [0,2,2,2,1,...]. But in Example 0's row 4, similar input, the output only replaces columns 1 and 2. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace the first two columns of 0s in each row. For example, for each row, after column 0, the first two 0s become 2s. But in Example 0's row 5, the first three 0s become 2s, which contradicts that.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let's try to think of another possible pattern.\n\nMaybe the 2s are cells that are in the same position as the 1s in the row below. For example, in Example 0's row 4, columns 1 and 2 are 2s. Looking at row 5's input, columns 1,2,3 are 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are the result of a bitwise operation between adjacent rows. For example, a 0 in a row becomes a 2 if there's a 1 in the same column in the row below. But in Example 0's row 4, column 1 is a 0 in the input and becomes a 2. In row 5, column 1 is 0. So no 1 below.\n\nThis is not working. Another idea: The 2s are part of a spiral pattern around the 1s. But I can't see that.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are cells that are part of the lower-left diagonal from the main cluster of 1s. For example, in Example 0, the main 1s are in the middle-right. The 2s are diagonally below and to the left.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at all the examples, the 2s seem to be placed in a vertical or diagonal strip to the left of the main 1s cluster. For the test input, the main 1s are clustered towards the right. So the 2s would likely form a vertical strip on the left. \n\nFor instance, in the test input's row 4: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]. The first 1 is at column 4. So maybe columns 1-3 become 2s. But in Example 0's row 4, only columns 1-2 are 2s. So perhaps there's a maximum of two columns replaced.\n\nAlternatively, considering the test input's row 2: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0]. The first 1 is at column 4. So columns 1-3 would become 2s, but maybe only if there are no 1s in previous rows in those columns.\n\nThis is really challenging. I think I'll have to go with the hypothesis that in each row, the 0s from column 1 up to (but not including) the first 1 are replaced with 2s. Let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest input row 0: first 1 at column 4. Replace columns 1-3. But output row 0 is likely to remain unchanged since in the training examples, the top rows often don't have 2s. But why?\n\nWait, in the training examples, the 2s start appearing in the middle rows. So maybe the rule applies only to certain rows, perhaps those that are part of a certain region.\n\nAlternatively, the rule applies to all rows except those with 1s in the first few columns. \n\nBut given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the assumption that in each row, starting from column 1, replace all 0s up to the first 1 with 2s. Let's see.\n\nTest input row 0: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]. First 1 at column 4. So columns 1-3 become 2s. Output row 0 would be [0,2,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nTest input row 1: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]. First 1 at column 2. So columns 1 is replaced. Output row 1: [0,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0].\n\nTest input row 2: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0]. First 1 at column 4. Columns 1-3 become 2s. Output: [0,2,2,2,1,1,0,0,1,0].\n\nTest input row 3: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0]. First 1 at column 4. Columns 1-3 become 2s. Output: [0,2,2,2,1,0,0,0,1,0].\n\nTest input row 4: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]. Columns 1-3 become 2s. Output: [0,2,2,2,1, ...].\n\nTest input row 5: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0]. First 1 at column 4. Columns 1-3 become 2s. Output: [0,2,2,2,1, ...].\n\nTest input row 6: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]. First 1 at column 5. Columns 1-4 become 2s. Output: [0,2,2,2,2,1, ...].\n\nTest input row 7: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]. First 1 at column 4. Columns 1-3 become 2s. Output: [0,2,2,2,1, ...].\n\nTest input row 8: [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0]. First 1 at column 3. Columns 1-2 become 2s. Output: [0,2,2,1, ...].\n\nTest input row 9: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. First 1 at column 5. Columns 1-4 become 2s. Output: [0,2,2,2,2,1, ...].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, in Example 0's row 4, the first 1 is at column 4, and columns 1-2 are 2s. So according to this rule, why are columns 1-3 not 2s? Because in Example 0's row 4, the output only has 2s in columns 1-2. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nAh, maybe there's a maximum of two 2s per row. Or perhaps the rule is to replace the first two 0s after column 0 with 2s. But in Example 1's row 5, there are four 2s. So that can't be.\n\nAt this point, I'm forced to conclude that the pattern is that in each row, the 0s from column 1 up to (but not including) the first 1 are replaced with 2s. Despite the inconsistency in Example 0's row 4, this seems to fit most cases, including the test input.\n\nSo applying this rule to the test input, the output would be:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,2,2,2,1,1,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,2,2,2,1,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow 5: [0,2,2,2,1,1,0,1,1,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,2,2,2,2,1,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,2,2,2,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,2,2,2,2,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, sometimes not all 0s are replaced. For example, Example 0's row 4 has [0,2,2,0, ...]. According to the rule, column 3 should also be 2. But it's not. So there must be another condition. \n\nMaybe the rule is that in each row, the 0s from column 1 up to the first 1 are replaced with 2s, but only if they are connected to other 2s in adjacent rows. For example, the 2s form a contiguous vertical block. \n\nIn Example 0's row 4, the first 1 is at column 4. Columns 1-3 are 0s. But only columns 1-2 become 2s. Maybe because column 3 is not connected to other 2s vertically. For example, row 5's column 3 is a 2. So row 4's column 3 would not be a 2 if there's no 2 in row 5's column 3. But in Example 0's output row 5, column 3 is 2. So row 4's column 3 should be 2. But it's not. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think the best approach is to proceed with the initial pattern observed in most rows and apply it to the test input, even if there are inconsistencies. Therefore, the final answer would be the test input with each row's 0s from column 1 up to the first 1 replaced with 2s.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0. The input has a bunch of 0s and 1s. The output has some 2s added. Let me compare them row by row.\n\nIn the input of Example 0, the first few rows are all 0s except for some 1s. The output introduces 2s in certain positions. Let's check row 4 (index 4, since it's 0-based). The input row is [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0], and the output is [0,2,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]. So the 2s are replacing some 0s. How are they positioned? They're in columns 1 and 2. Hmm. Let me check the surrounding cells. Maybe it's about being adjacent to 1s but in a certain way.\n\nWait, maybe the 2s are filling in regions of 0s that are enclosed by 1s. Or perhaps it's a path or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a cellular automaton rule, but with specific conditions.\n\nLooking at another example, Example 1. The input has some 1s forming a sort of structure, and the output adds 2s in the middle rows. For instance, in row 3 of the input, it's [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1], and the output changes the first two 0s to 2s. So [0,2,2,0,0,1,...]. Maybe the 2s are filling areas that are surrounded by 1s on certain sides.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are filling the \"valleys\" or regions that are enclosed by 1s from the top, left, and right. Let me think. In Example 0's output, the 2s form a vertical line in the middle. Wait, in the input, the 2s in the output are in positions that are surrounded by 1s on both sides? Not exactly sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for how the 2s are placed relative to the 1s. Maybe the 2s are replacing 0s that are adjacent to exactly three 1s in a certain direction. Or maybe they're along the edges of the 1s regions.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output row 5 (index 5), the input row is [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0], and the output is [0,2,2,2,1,1,0,1,1,0]. So the first three 0s (positions 1,2,3) become 2s. Looking at their neighbors. Let's take position (5,1) in the input. It's 0. What's around it? Let's check the cells around it in the input grid. Above (row4, column1) is 0. Below (row6, column1) is 0. To the left is 0 (column0). To the right (column2) is 0. Hmm, but in the output, this cell becomes 2. That doesn't seem to be adjacent to 1s. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the 2s are filling regions that are enclosed by 1s in certain directions. For example, in Example 0, the 2s form a sort of vertical strip. Let me see if those 2s are in columns that are between 1s on the left and right. Let's check the input for row 4. The 2s are in columns 1 and 2. To the left of column 1, there's a 0. To the right, column3 is 0. Wait, maybe it's more about the vertical alignment. Or perhaps the 2s are filling the 0s that are below a certain structure of 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a kind of flood fill where 2s are filled starting from certain positions. But how to determine the starting points.\n\nAnother idea: look for the number of 1s in adjacent rows. For example, in the output, the 2s might be in cells where, in the input, the cell is 0 and the cells above and below (or left and right) have 1s. Or maybe in the same column, the cell is 0 and there are 1s both above and below it in that column.\n\nLet me check Example 0. In row4, columns1 and 2. The original cell is 0. Let's check the columns. In column1: looking up and down. Row3, column1 is 0. Row5, column1 is 0. So maybe that's not it. But maybe looking at the rows. The row4 in the input has 1s starting from column4 to 8. So maybe the 2s are on the left side of the 1s in the same row. But row4 has 0s in columns0-3 except column0 is 0. So the 2s are in columns1 and 2. Maybe they are adjacent to the left of the 1s? But columns1 and 2 are 0s, and column4 is 1. So maybe two cells to the left of the 1s in the same row. But in row5, the input is [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0]. The output has 2s in positions1,2,3. The 1s start at column4. So positions1-3 are three cells to the left of the 1s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are filling in 0s that are surrounded by 1s on the left and right in the same row. Let's check Example 0's row5 input: the 0s at columns1,2,3. The 1s are at columns4,5,7,8. So columns1-3 are 0s, but to their left (column0) is 0, and to their right (columns4) is 1. So maybe if a 0 is to the left of a 1 and there's a continuous block of 0s adjacent to the left side of a 1 block in the same row. Then those 0s get replaced by 2s. But how far left?\n\nWait, in Example 0's row5 output, the 2s are from column1-3. The input's row5 has 1s starting at column4. So columns1-3 are 0s, but perhaps the 2s are the cells that are left of the 1s in the same row, and are contiguous. But then in row5, columns0 is 0 but it's not turned into a 2. Hmm. So maybe not just left of 1s.\n\nAnother angle: in the output, the 2s form a vertical line in some cases. For instance, in Example 0, rows4 and 5 have 2s in column1 and 2. Then row5 has column3 as 2. So maybe it's a path that connects from top to bottom, turning certain 0s into 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 0s that are on the minimal path between certain points. But how would that be determined.\n\nLooking at Example1. The output has 2s forming horizontal lines in the middle rows. For instance, row3 and 4 have 2s in columns1 and 2. Row5 has 2s in columns1-4. Then rows6 and 7 have 2s in columns1 and 2 again. So maybe the 2s are forming a horizontal band through the middle of the grid. But why those positions?\n\nWait, in the input of Example1, the 1s form a sort of structure with a gap in the middle rows. For example, row3 in the input is [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1], which has a 1 at column5. The 2s in the output are in the left part of the row, columns1 and 2. Maybe the 2s are filling in the 0s that are to the left of the leftmost 1 in the row. But let's check.\n\nIn row3 of Example1 input, the first 1 is at column5. The 2s in columns1 and 2. So that's to the left. But how many cells to the left?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are filling the 0s that are in regions that are enclosed by 1s on the left, right, and top. But this is getting vague.\n\nAnother approach: compare the positions where 2s are added. Let's see for each example:\n\nExample0:\n\nThe 2s are in rows4,5,6. Specifically, in row4 columns1 and 2, row5 columns1-3, row6 column1.\n\nExample1:\n\nThe 2s are in rows3-7 columns1-2 (rows3,4,6,7) and row5 columns1-4.\n\nExample2:\n\nIn Example2's output, the 2s are in various positions. For example, row3 column1, row4 columns1 and 3, row5 columns1-4, etc.\n\nHmm. It's not immediately obvious. Maybe the 2s are added in cells that are part of a \"valley\" between two 1s in adjacent columns. Or perhaps the 2s are in cells that are adjacent to 1s but in a certain direction, like diagonally.\n\nWait, in Example0's row4, columns1 and 2 are 2s. Let's check the cells around them. For cell (4,1): in the input, it's 0. The cell above (3,1) is 0. The cell below (5,1) is 0. The cell to the right (4,2) is 0. But in row4, the 1s start at column4. Maybe the 2s are filling a path that leads to the 1s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are filling 0s that are enclosed by 1s in a certain way. For example, if a 0 is surrounded by 1s on two opposite sides. Like, if in the same column, there's a 1 above and below, or in the same row, 1s to the left and right.\n\nCheck Example0 row4, column1: the column1. Let's look up and down. Row0-3, column1: all 0s. Row5, column1 is 0. So no 1s above or below. But in the same row, column4 is 1. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the 2s are part of a \"fill\" operation where 0s are filled with 2s if they are reachable from a certain starting point without crossing 1s. But where's the starting point? Looking at Example0's output, the 2s form a kind of vertical line. Maybe the starting point is the bottom of a certain structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added to cells that are between two 1s in the same row. For example, in Example0's row5 input: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0]. The 1s are at columns4,5,7,8. The 2s are filled in columns1-3. Those 0s are to the left of the first group of 1s (columns4-5). But there's a gap between the first and second group of 1s. Maybe the 2s are filling the 0s between the leftmost and rightmost 1s in the row. Wait, in row5, the leftmost 1 is at column4, rightmost at column8. So the 0s from column0 to column3. But the 2s are in columns1-3, not column0. So maybe there's a different rule.\n\nAnother thought: the 2s are in cells that are adjacent (including diagonally) to exactly two 1s. Let's check that. For example, in Example0's row4, column1: adjacent cells. Let's see. The cell (4,1) is 0 in input. Its neighbors are:\n\nUp: (3,1) = 0\n\nDown: (5,1) = 0\n\nLeft: (4,0) = 0\n\nRight: (4,2) = 0\n\nDiagonally: (3,0), (3,2), (5,0), (5,2). All 0s. So no 1s adjacent. So that can't be it.\n\nHmm. Maybe the 2s are part of a specific pattern that's determined by the number of 1s in certain positions. For instance, in a cell, if the number of 1s in the same column below it is equal to the number above, then replace with 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are added in regions where there are 1s both above and below in the same column, creating a sort of enclosed area. Let's check Example0's row4, column1. Are there 1s above and below? In column1, rows above row4: all 0s. Below row4: row5, column1 is 0. So no.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's look for another approach. Maybe the 2s are added to cells that are part of the minimal path from the top to the bottom of the grid, but only in certain areas. But the examples don't show a clear top-to-bottom path.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's input, the output adds 2s in a vertical line that seems to be in the middle-left part. Similarly, Example1's 2s form a horizontal band in the middle. Example2's 2s are more spread out but in a vertical line again. So perhaps the 2s are added in a vertical strip that's to the left of the main 1s structures.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the 2s are the cells that are in the same row as a 1, and are to the left of the leftmost 1 in that row, but within certain constraints. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0, row4 has 1s starting at column4. The 2s are in columns1 and 2, which are to the left of column4. But the leftmost 1 is column4. So how many columns to the left?\n\nIn row4, the 2s are two columns left of the leftmost 1. But in row5, the leftmost 1 is column4, and the 2s are columns1-3. That's three columns. Not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all 0s to the left of the first 1 in the row are turned into 2s. But in Example0's row4, the first 1 is at column4. The 0s from column0 to3. But in the output, only columns1 and 2 are 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The 2s are added in cells where, in the same column, there is a 1 in the row above and the row below. Let's check Example0's row4, column1. Row3, column1 is 0; row5, column1 is 0. So no. That's not the case.\n\nHmm. Let's try comparing the inputs and outputs more carefully.\n\nTake Example0:\n\nInput row4: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nOutput row4: [0,2,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nSo columns1 and 2 (indices1 and 2) are turned from 0 to 2.\n\nLooking at the surrounding cells:\n\nIn row4, columns1 and 2. The cell above (row3, column1) is 0. The cell below (row5, column1) is 0. But in the output of row5, columns1-3 are 2s. So maybe there's a vertical line forming. Perhaps the 2s are added in a vertical strip that starts from row4 and extends down, but only where there are 0s. For example, in row4, columns1-2 are 2s. Then row5, columns1-3. Row6, column1. So it's a vertical line that widens as it goes down, then narrows.\n\nThis might be a case of a cellular automaton where cells turn to 2 if they are 0 and have a certain number of neighboring 2s. But how would that start? The initial 2s must be placed based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in a diamond-shaped area around a central point. But I'm not seeing a clear center.\n\nWait, another observation: in Example0's output, the 2s form a vertical line that seems to be connected to the 1s. For example, in row5, the 2s are adjacent to 1s. Maybe the 2s are filling in 0s that are adjacent to both 1s and other 2s, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in cells where the sum of certain directional neighbors meets a condition. For example, if a cell has a 1 to the east and a 1 to the west, then it's a 2. But that's not matching the examples.\n\nAnother angle: the 2s are added in a way that they form a connected region that is adjacent to the 1s. For instance, in Example0, the 2s form a connected area adjacent to the left side of the 1s. But in Example1, the 2s are on the left side of the structure as well.\n\nLooking at the test input, maybe the 2s should be added in a vertical strip on the left side of certain 1s. Let's look at the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo, the 1s are clustered around the middle and right parts of the grid. For example, row1 has 1s from column2 to6. Row4 has 1s from column4 to9. Row8 has 1s from column3 to7.\n\nIf the pattern is to add 2s to the left of the leftmost 1 in each row, but only in certain conditions. For example, maybe if there's a certain number of 0s to the left of the leftmost 1, then fill those 0s with 2s. Let's check the training examples.\n\nIn Example0's row4, the leftmost 1 is at column4. To the left, there are 4 zeros (columns0-3). In the output, columns1-2 are 2s. Not all the 0s to the left. So maybe there's a maximum distance from the leftmost 1. For example, two cells to the left.\n\nBut in Example0's row5, leftmost 1 is column4. The 2s are columns1-3. So three cells to the left. Hmm. Not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in the leftmost continuous block of 0s in each row. Let's check:\n\nExample0's row4: the leftmost 0s are columns0-3. But only columns1-2 are 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are added to the 0s that are between the leftmost 1 and the next 1 to the left. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother thought: the 2s are added in cells that are in the same column as a 1 in the previous or next row. For example, if a column has a 1 in the row above or below, then the 0s in that column are turned into 2s. Let's test.\n\nIn Example0's row4, column1. Row3, column1 is 0. Row5, column1 is 0. So no. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, columns that have at least one 1 in any row, and the 0s in those columns are turned into 2s. But looking at Example0's output, columns1 and 2 have 2s. Are there any 1s in columns1 or 2 in the input? No. All the 1s in Example0's input are in columns3 and onwards. So that's not it.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the 2s are forming a kind of shadow or contour around the 1s. For example, cells that are adjacent to multiple 1s in certain directions.\n\nIn Example0's row4, column1: the cell is 0. Let's check all eight neighbors. Up row3, column1:0. Down row5, column1:0. Left: row4,0:0. Right: row4,2:0. Diagonally: row3,0:0; row3,2:0; row5,0:0; row5,2:0. So all neighbors are 0. No 1s nearby. So why is it a 2?\n\nHmm. Maybe it's part of a larger structure. For example, in the input, if there's a U-shaped arrangement of 1s, the 2s fill the inside. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's input, rows4-8 have 1s in the middle. The output adds 2s in rows4-6 on the left. Maybe the 2s are filling the left side of a 'valley' formed by 1s. For example, the 2s are in cells that are to the left of the main cluster of 1s and are enclosed on the top, bottom, and right by 1s. But in Example0, the cells with 2s (like row4, columns1-2) are not enclosed by 1s on top and bottom. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the 2s are added in cells that are part of a certain region connected to the left edge. But in Example0, the left edge is all 0s except for row4 and 5 where 2s are added. So maybe a flood fill from the left edge. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are added to cells that are part of a path leading from the leftmost 1 in a row to another part. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example2's input and output. In row3 of the input, the cell at column1 is 0, and in the output it becomes 2. The input row3 is [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1]. The output row3 is [0,2,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1]. So why is column1 a 2? Let's look at neighboring rows. In row2, column1 is 0. Row4, column1 is 0. So again, not surrounded by 1s.\n\nMaybe there's a pattern where the 2s are placed in cells that are in certain rows where the 1s form a certain shape, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nLet me think of another possible approach. Perhaps the transformation is related to Conway's Game of Life, where cells change based on their neighbors. But with a different set of rules leading to 2s instead of 1s.\n\nFor example, a 0 cell becomes a 2 if it has exactly three 1 neighbors. Let's check. In Example0's row4, column1. The cell is 0. Let's count the number of 1s in the eight neighboring cells. All are 0. So that's zero. So that can't be.\n\nAnother possible rule: a 0 becomes a 2 if there are exactly two 1s in adjacent cells (including diagonally). But again, in Example0's row4, column1 has zero 1s adjacent.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for another pattern. Maybe the 2s are placed in cells that are in the same positions as some other feature, like the center of the grid or certain symmetries.\n\nLooking at Example0's output, the 2s form a vertical strip in columns1-3. The center of the grid is around column4.5. So columns1-3 are left of center. Example1's 2s are more to the left. Example2's 2s are also on the left.\n\nMaybe the 2s are added to the left of the main cluster of 1s in the grid. For instance, in each row, if there are 1s present, add 2s to the left of them up to a certain distance.\n\nIn Example0's row4, the 1s start at column4. The output has 2s in columns1-2. Row5's 1s start at column4, output has 2s up to column3. So it's like a varying number of 2s to the left. This might depend on the row's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in a diamond shape around the center of the grid. The center is at (4.5, 4.5). For example, in Example0, the 2s are around row4-5, column1-3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s form a vertical line that's three columns wide (columns1-3) in the middle rows. But Example0's output has varying widths.\n\nAnother approach: look for the 2s in the output and see if they are all in columns that have at least one 1 in some row. For example, in Example0's columns1 and 2 have 2s, but no 1s in any row. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are added to cells that are in rows where there's a 1 in the same row, and the cell is a certain distance from the left edge.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are in cells that are part of a \"wave\" pattern, expanding from a certain point. For example, starting from the bottom and moving up, adding 2s where certain conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of vertical and horizontal fill. For instance, in Example1, the 2s form a horizontal line in the middle rows, but in other examples they form vertical lines. So perhaps the 2s are added in regions that are bounded by 1s on multiple sides.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 1s as walls, and the 2s as filling areas enclosed by those walls. But how to determine which enclosed areas are filled.\n\nIn Example0's output, the 2s are in a vertical strip that's not enclosed by 1s on all sides, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the 2s are added to cells that are in the same position as certain parity. For example, even or odd rows/columns. But in the examples, the 2s are in various rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are added in positions where the sum of the row and column indices is even or odd. But I don't see a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are added in cells that are part of a diagonal line. For example, in Example0's output, row4 column1, row5 column2, row6 column3, but that's not the case. The 2s in Example0 are more vertical.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's try to find any commonality between the positions where 2s are added.\n\nIn Example0, the 2s are added in rows 4-6, columns1-3.\n\nIn Example1, rows3-7, columns1-4.\n\nIn Example2, rows3-6, columns1-4.\n\nSo perhaps the 2s are added in the middle rows and middle-left columns of the grid.\n\nBut the test input's structure is different. Let's see where the 1s are in the test input.\n\nTest input's rows:\n\nRow0: 1 at column4.\n\nRow1: 1s from columns2-6.\n\nRow2: 1s at columns4-5 and 8.\n\nRow3: 1 at column4, and 8.\n\nRow4: 1s from columns4-9.\n\nRow5: 1s at columns4-5,7-8.\n\nRow6: 1 at column5,8.\n\nRow7: 1s at columns4-5.\n\nRow8: 1s from columns3-7.\n\nRow9: 1 at column5.\n\nSo the main clusters of 1s are in the middle and right side. So if the pattern is to add 2s in the middle-left columns, perhaps the 2s would be added in columns1-3 in the rows that have 1s.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the 2s are often added in columns1-4, left of the main 1s.\n\nSo for the test input, perhaps the 2s are added in the left part of the rows that have 1s. For example, in row1, the 1s start at column2. So maybe columns0-1 become 2s. But the input for row1 is [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]. So the 1s start at column2. The output may have 2s in columns0-1. But in the training examples, the 2s are added starting from column1. Let's check Example1's row3, which has 1s starting at column5, and the output has 2s in columns1-2. So maybe two columns to the left of the first 1.\n\nIn row1 of the test input, first 1 is column2. So two columns to the left would be columns0-1. But the input has 0s there. So the output would replace those with 2s. But wait, looking at Example1's row3, the first 1 is at column5, and 2s are in columns1-2. So that's three columns to the left. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 2s added depends on the distance from the left edge. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are added to all 0s in the row that are to the left of the first 1 in that row, but only up to a certain distance. For example, up to three columns.\n\nIn the test input's row1, the first 1 is at column2. So columns0-1 are to the left. If we replace those with 2s, the output row1 would be [2,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]. But in the training examples, the 2s are added in a way that doesn't start from column0. For example, in Example0's row4, the first 1 is at column4, and the 2s start at column1. So maybe skipping column0.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: in a row where there's at least one 1, replace the 0s from column1 up to the column before the first 1 with 2s. But only if there's a certain number of 0s.\n\nIn row1 of the test input, first 1 is column2. So columns0-1 are 0s. But replacing column1 (since column0 is skipped). So maybe column1 becomes 2. But row1's input is [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]. So replacing columns1 with 2.\n\nBut in Example0's row4, first 1 is at column4. Columns1-3 are 0s. In the output, columns1-2 are 2s. Column3 remains 0. So maybe it's only replacing the first two columns to the left of the first 1.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 2s added depends on the row's index. For example, in the middle rows, more 2s are added. But in Example0, row4 (middle row) has two 2s, row5 has three, row6 has one. So not sure.\n\nAnother possible rule: in each row, starting from the left, find the first 1. Then, all 0s to the left of that 1, starting from column1, are turned into 2s up to a certain number. For example, columns1 and 2.\n\nBut why column1 and 2? Maybe if the first 1 is in columnn, then columnsn-3 to n-1 become 2s.\n\nIn Example0's row4, first 1 is at column4. So 4-3=1 to 4-1=3. So columns1-3. But in the output, columns1-2 are 2s. So perhaps it's a range but limited by some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are added in columns that are to the left of the first 1 and are even or odd. For example, only even-indexed columns.\n\nBut in Example0's row4, columns1-2 are 2s. Column1 is odd index (assuming 0-based), column2 is even. So that's mixed.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at Example2's output, the 2s are in various positions. For instance, row5 has 2s in columns1-4. The first 1 in row5's input is at column5. So columns1-4 are to the left. The output replaces them with 2s. But why?\n\nWait, in Example2's input row5: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1]. The first 1 is at column5. The output row5 is [0,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1]. So all columns1-4 (to the left of the first 1) are turned into 2s, except column0. So the rule here is: in a row, the 0s to the left of the first 1 (starting from column1) are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut in Example0's row4, the first 1 is at column4. Columns1-3 are to the left. But in the output, only columns1-2 are 2s, column3 remains 0. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. But perhaps there's a maximum of two columns to the left that are replaced. For example, if the first 1 is at columnn, then columnsn-2 and n-3 are replaced. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 2s added depends on how many 0s are between column1 and the first 1. For example, if there are three 0s between column1 and the first 1, then replace them all. But in Example0's row4, columns1-3 are three 0s (columns1,2,3), but only two are replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 2s added increases as you go down the rows. Like, upper rows have fewer 2s, middle rows have more, and lower rows have fewer again. This seems to be the case in Example0. So row4 has two 2s, row5 three, row6 one. So it's like a peak in the middle.\n\nBut how does that apply to the other examples? Example1's output has the most 2s in row5 (four columns), then two in other rows. So it's also a peak in the middle.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: in each row, the number of 2s added depends on how close the row is to the middle of the grid. For the test input, which has 10 rows, the middle rows are 4 and 5 (0-based). So rows4 and5 would have more 2s.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows4 and5: row4 is [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]. The first 1 is at column4. So columns1-3 are 0s. If the rule is to add 2s in columns1-3 for row4 (middle row), then output would have 2s there.\n\nRow5 in test input is [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0]. First 1 at column4. So columns1-3 would be 0s. Maybe replaced with 2s.\n\nRow6 is [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]. First 1 at column5. So columns1-4 are 0s. Maybe replaced with 2s up to column4.\n\nBut I need to see how the training examples fit. For Example0's row4 (middle row), first 1 at column4. Output replaces columns1-2. So two columns. Example1's row5 (middle row), first 1 at column5. Output replaces columns1-4 (four columns). So this seems to vary.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 2s added is equal to the row index minus some value. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Let me try to hypothesize a rule based on the examples and apply it to the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input, the middle rows are 4 and5. In row4, the first 1 is at column4. Columns1-3 are 0s. The output might replace these with 2s. So row4's output would be [0,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1]. Then row5's first 1 is column4. Columns1-3 are 0s. So replaced with 2s: [0,2,2,2,1,1,0,1,1,0]. But in the training examples, sometimes the 2s extend into the right side if there are 0s. For example, in Example0's row5, after the 1s, there's a 0 at column6 which is replaced with 2. But that's not to the left of the first 1. So perhaps there's another rule for that.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are added to all 0s in a row that are between the first and last 1 of that row. But in Example0's row4, the first 1 is column4 and last is column8. So columns4-8 are 1s. The 0s to the left (columns0-3) are replaced with 2s in part. But the output only has columns1-2 as 2s.\n\nThis isn't adding up. Maybe the pattern is to replace 0s with 2s in cells that are in the same row and column as certain conditions related to the 1s' positions in neighboring rows.\n\nFor example, if a cell is 0 and in the same column as a 1 in the previous row, and the next row, then it becomes 2.\n\nIn Example0's row4, column1: the previous row3, column1 is 0, next row5, column1 is 0. So no. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, if in the same column, there's a 1 in the row above or below, and the cell is 0, then it becomes 2.\n\nIn Example0's row4, column1: row3 and5 are 0s. So no. So that's not it.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Let me try to think of the test input and what the expected output might be based on the training examples.\n\nLooking at the test input's row1: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]. The first 1 is at column2. In Example1's row3, first 1 is at column5, output has 2s in columns1-2. Maybe for each row, the number of 2s is two columns to the left of the first 1. So for row1 of test input, first 1 at column2. Columns0-1 would be 0s. So replace them with 2s. So row1's output would be [2,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]. But in the training examples, the 2s start from column1, not column0. For example, in Example0's row4, the 2s start at column1, skipping column0. So perhaps the rule is to replace all 0s from column1 up to two columns before the first 1. \n\nWait, if the first 1 is at columnn, then columns1 to n-2 are replaced. For example:\n\nIn Example0's row4: first 1 at column4. n-2 is 4-2=2. So columns1-2 are 2s.\n\nIn Example1's row3: first 1 at column5. n-2=3. So columns1-3. But in the output, columns1-2 are 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, columns1 to n-1. Example0's row4: columns1-3 (4-1=3). But output is 1-2. So not.\n\nAlternatively, columns1 to n-3. For Example0's row4: 4-3=1. So column1 only. But output has columns1-2. So no.\n\nThis isn't working. \n\nGiven that I'm time-constrained, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. It seems that the 2s are added to the left of the main 1s clusters in the middle rows. For the test input, the middle rows are 4 and5. So rows4-5 would have more 2s.\n\nLooking at the test input's row4: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]. The first 1 is at column4. The output might have 2s in columns1-3. So the output row4 would be [0,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0]. First 1 at column4. So columns1-3 would be 2s. But there's a 0 at column6 (which is after the first 1). In Example0's row5, the 0 at column6 is replaced with 2. So perhaps all 0s between the first and last 1 in the row are also replaced with 2s. Wait, in Example0's row5 input: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0]. The 1s are at columns4,5,7,8. So between columns4 and8, there's a 0 at column6. In the output, this 0 is replaced with 2. So maybe the 0s that are between the first and last 1 in the row are also replaced.\n\nSo the rule could be: For each row, replace all 0s that are either to the left of the first 1 or between the first and last 1 with 2s. But not the 0s to the right of the last 1.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis on the training examples.\n\nExample0's row5 input: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0]. First 1 at column4, last at column8. The 0s to the left of column4 (columns0-3) are replaced with 2s. Between 4 and8, the 0 at column6 is replaced. So output becomes [0,2,2,2,1,1,2,1,1,0]. But the actual output is [0,2,2,2,1,1,0,1,1,0]. Oh, the 0 at column6 remains. So that doesn't fit.\n\nSo maybe the rule is only the 0s to the left of the first 1 are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut then why in Example0's row5, the 0 at column3 is replaced (it's to the left of the first 1 at column4). So columns1-3 are replaced.\n\nIn that case, for each row, all 0s from column1 up to the column before the first 1 are replaced with 2s.\n\nIn Example0's row4: first 1 at column4. So columns1-3 are replaced. But in the output, only columns1-2 are replaced. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, if the rule is to replace columns1 up to (first 1 - 2). So first 1 at column4: 4-2=2. So columns1-2. Which matches Example0's row4 output.\n\nExample1's row3: first 1 at column5. 5-2=3. Columns1-3. But in the output, columns1-2 are replaced. So that's one column short.\n\nExample2's row3: first 1 at column4. 4-2=2. Columns1-2. Output has column1 replaced. So not matching.\n\nHmm. This approach is inconsistent.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. The pattern seems to involve adding 2s to the left of the first 1 in each row, possibly in certain rows. For the test input, the middle rows (4 and5) would likely have the most 2s.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]. First 1 at column4. So columns1-3 are 0s. Replace with 2s: [0,2,2,2,1,...].\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0]. First 1 at column4. Replace columns1-3: [0,2,2,2,1,1,0,1,1,0].\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]. First 1 at column5. Replace columns1-4: [0,2,2,2,2,1,0,0,1,0].\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]. First 1 at column4. Replace columns1-3: [0,2,2,2,1,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0]. First 1 at column3. Replace columns1-2: [0,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,0].\n\nOther rows:\n\nRow0 has a single 1 at column4. Replace columns1-3: [0,2,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow1: first 1 at column2. Replace column1: [0,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0].\n\nRow2: first 1 at column4. Replace columns1-3: [0,2,2,2,1,1,0,0,1,0].\n\nRow3: first 1 at column4. Replace columns1-3: [0,2,2,2,1,0,0,0,1,0].\n\nRow9: first 1 at column5. Replace columns1-4: [0,2,2,2,2,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, it's not always the case that all left 0s are replaced. For example, in Example0's row4, only columns1-2 are replaced out of possible 1-3. So perhaps there's a maximum of two columns replaced regardless of the first 1's position.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 2s added depends on the row's distance from the middle. For example, middle rows have more 2s.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this approach and see if it fits the training examples.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow4: columns1-3 become 2s.\n\nRow5: columns1-3 become 2s.\n\nRow6: columns1-4 become 2s.\n\nRow7: columns1-3 become 2s.\n\nRow8: columns1-2 become 2s.\n\nRow1: column1 becomes 2.\n\nRow2: columns1-3 become 2s.\n\nRow3: columns1-3 become 2s.\n\nRow0: columns1-3 become 2s.\n\nRow9: columns1-4 become 2s.\n\nBut the training examples don't always replace all possible columns. For instance, in Example0's row4, columns1-3 are possible but only 1-2 are replaced. So maybe there's a maximum of two columns replaced.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 2s added is two columns per row, starting from column1.\n\nIn that case, for test input's row4: columns1-2 are 2s.\n\nRow5: columns1-2-3 are 2s (but Example0's row5 has three 2s). So this may vary.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll proceed with the initial approach and see if the output matches the format of the training examples.",
