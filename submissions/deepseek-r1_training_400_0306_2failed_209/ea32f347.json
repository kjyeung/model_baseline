        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input has 5s and the output has numbers like 1, 2, 4, etc. My first thought is that maybe the output numbers are counting something related to the 5s in the input. \n\nLet's look at Example 0. The input has a vertical line of 5s starting from row 1, column 1 (assuming rows are 0-indexed). The output changes those 5s into 1s, then in the third row there's a 4 where the 5 is, and later a 2. Hmm. Maybe the numbers represent the order in which the 5s are connected or the direction they're pointing?\n\nWait, another observation: In Example 0's output, the vertical line of 5s becomes 1s, and then in the middle there's a 4. Then on the right side, there's a 2. Looking at the positions, maybe each number represents the direction from which the 5 is connected. Like 1 is up, 2 is right, 4 is left, etc.? Or perhaps it's counting the number of adjacent 5s in a certain way.\n\nWait, let's check Example 1. The input has a vertical column of 5s in the middle, and in the output, those become 1s. Then on the left, there's a 4, and on the right, a 2. Maybe the numbers indicate the direction of the \"branch\" from a main line. For instance, the main vertical line is 1, then a branch to the left is 4, and to the right is 2. Because in Example 0, the main vertical line (1s) splits to the right (2) and left (4). Wait, but in Example 0, the 4 is in the same column as the 1s but shifted? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of steps you can move in a certain direction from each 5. For instance, in a vertical line of 5s, the top one is 1, then the next ones are part of the same line. But in Example 0, the 4 is in a position that's connected to a horizontal line. Wait, maybe it's about the structure of the 5s. Let's see: in the input, the 5s form certain shapes. For example, in Example 0, there's a vertical line in column 1 (rows 1-6), and then in row 2, column 4 there's a 5. Then in the output, that 5 becomes a 4. Then in row 4, column 7, the 5 becomes a 2.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output numbers represent how many directions the 5 is connected. Like, a 5 that's part of a vertical line would have value 1 (only up and down connections), but maybe the number is based on the direction of the line. Alternatively, the numbers could be encoding the direction of the line. For example, 1 for vertical, 2 for horizontal right, 4 for horizontal left? Or maybe 1 is up-down, 2 is right-left, 4 is something else.\n\nWait, in Example 3's input, there's a vertical line of 5s on the right side (column 7, rows 1-7) which in the output becomes 1s. Then there's a horizontal line in row 2 (columns 1-4) which becomes 2s. Then in row 5, there's a longer horizontal line (columns 1-5) which becomes 4s. Wait, why 2 and 4 here? The horizontal line in row 2 is 5s, and becomes 2s. The horizontal line in row 5 becomes 4s. Maybe the number increases based on the order of processing? Or perhaps the length of the line. The first horizontal line (row 2) is length 4, becomes 2s, and the next (row 5) is length 5, becomes 4s. That doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe it's the direction. If a horizontal line is to the right, it's 2, and to the left is 4? Or maybe the numbers correspond to the number of turns in the structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are determined by the position in a sequence. Like, the first connected component is labeled 1, the next 2, and so on. But looking at Example 0's output, there's a 1, then 4, then 2. So that doesn't fit. Unless the order is based on some priority like starting from the top-left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number represents the count of adjacent 5s in specific directions. For instance, if a 5 is part of a vertical line, each cell in that line gets 1 (since there's one direction connected). If it's part of a horizontal line, maybe 2. But in Example 3, the vertical line becomes 1, and horizontal lines become 2 and 4. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output has 1s in the horizontal line at row 2. Then, in row 7, there's a horizontal line of 2s. Then a vertical line in column 7 becomes 4s. So maybe 1 is horizontal left-right, 2 is horizontal again but perhaps different? Or maybe the numbers are based on the direction of the line. For example, vertical is 1, horizontal right is 2, horizontal left is 4. Wait, that might make sense. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the main vertical line is 5s in column 1. Output is 1s. Then in column 4, there's a vertical line, which in output is 4. Wait, that's vertical again. Hmm. That doesn't fit. So maybe not direction.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output numbers indicate the number of adjacent 5s in a certain direction. For example, if a 5 is connected above and below, it's part of a vertical line (value 1). If connected left and right, it's a horizontal line (value 2). If it's the start of a vertical line (only below has a 5), then value 1. Similarly, if it's the end, maybe 1 as well. But how does that explain 4 and 2?\n\nLooking at Example 3's output, the vertical line in column 7 is all 1s. The horizontal line in row 2 (columns 1-4) is 2s. The horizontal line in row 5 (columns 1-5) is 4s. So maybe the number is based on the length of the horizontal line. Row 2's horizontal line has 4 5s, so output is 2. Row 5's has 5, output is 4. But that doesn't fit a direct numerical relation. 4 \u2192 2, 5 \u21924? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number represents the number of branches. Like a main line with branches gets higher numbers, but that's vague.\n\nWait, maybe the output numbers are encoding directions using a bitmask. For example:\n\n- 1: up\n- 2: right\n- 4: left\n- 8: down\n\nBut then each cell's value is the sum of directions where there's a 5. For example, a vertical line cell would have up and down connections, so 1 + 8 = 9. But in the examples, the vertical lines have 1. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers indicate the count of 5s in the same row or column. For example, if a cell is part of a vertical line of 5s, the count is the number in that line. But in Example 0, the vertical line in column 1 has 6 cells (rows 1-6), but the output is 1 for all. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's look at the transitions between the input and output in each example. For example, in Example 0:\n\nInput row 1: [0,5,0,...] \u2192 Output row 1: [0,1,0,...]\n\nInput row 2: [0,5,0,0,5,0...] \u2192 Output row 2: [0,1,0,0,4,0...]\n\nSo the 5 in column 1 becomes 1, the 5 in column 4 becomes 4. Then in row 4, column 7's 5 becomes 2. So the 1, 4, 2 might be codes for directions. For example, 1 is vertical, 4 is left, 2 is right. So each 5 in the input is part of a line, and the output number indicates the direction of the line relative to its position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers represent the order in which the lines are encountered. For example, the first vertical line is 1, the next horizontal line is 2, etc. But in Example 0, the vertical line is 1, the next vertical line (column 4) is 4, which is higher. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output numbers are based on the sum of the coordinates. For example, row + column mod something. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother angle: Let's see all possible output numbers in the examples. We have 1, 2, 4. In the third example, also 4 and 2. Maybe these numbers are flags. Let's think of binary: 1 is 001, 2 is 010, 4 is 100. Maybe each bit represents a direction. For example, 1 (binary 001) means up, 2 (010) means right, 4 (100) means left, and combinations can occur. But in the examples, the numbers are 1, 2, 4, so they don't sum. For example, in Example 0, the vertical line is all 1s. If vertical lines are considered to have both up and down connections, maybe that's 1+8=9, but the output is 1. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers indicate the number of turns taken to reach that cell from the start of the line. For example, a straight vertical line has 0 turns, so 1. A line that turns right is 2, left is 4. But in Example 0, the vertical line is 1, then a horizontal line to the right from it becomes 2. In the output, the horizontal line to the right (column 7) is 2. The horizontal line to the left (column 4) is 4. That could fit. So 1 for vertical, 2 for right turn, 4 for left turn.\n\nSo the pattern could be: Each line of 5s is a path, and the output numbers indicate the direction of the path. Starting from the first 5 in the path (maybe topmost, leftmost), each segment is labeled with a code. For vertical segments, 1. For horizontal segments to the right, 2. For horizontal segments to the left, 4. Then, each time the direction changes, the code changes accordingly.\n\nFor example, in Example 0:\n\n- The vertical line in column 1 is labeled 1.\n- The horizontal line in column 4 (same row as the vertical line's 5) goes left, so 4.\n- The horizontal line in column 7 (same row as the vertical line's 5) goes right, so 2.\n\nThat seems to fit. Let's check Example 1:\n\nThe main vertical line in column 4 (rows 1-5) becomes 1s. Then there's a horizontal line to the left (column 0, rows 3-6) which becomes 4. Then a horizontal line to the right (column 7) becomes 2. So that matches.\n\nIn Example 2, the horizontal line in row 2 (columns 0-5) becomes 1s. Then a vertical line in column 7 (rows 3-7) becomes 4. The horizontal line in row 7 (columns 2-4) becomes 2. Hmm, but the vertical line in column 7 is labeled 4, which would imply a left turn, but it's a vertical line. Wait, maybe the vertical line is part of a path that turns left from a horizontal line.\n\nWait, perhaps each line starts with a certain code and continues. For example, the main direction is vertical (1), but when a horizontal branch is added, the code depends on the direction. For example, in Example 2, the horizontal line at the top (row 2) is labeled 1. Then the vertical line (column 7) is connected to that horizontal line. How? Maybe the vertical line is a branch going down from the horizontal line, so that's a left turn? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are assigned based on the direction the line is drawn. For instance:\n\n- Vertical lines (up-down) are labeled 1.\n- Horizontal lines going right are labeled 2.\n- Horizontal lines going left are labeled 4.\n\nBut in Example 2, the horizontal line in row 2 is labeled 1. That contradicts. Unless there's another rule. Wait, in Example 2, the horizontal line in row 2 is the first line, and the output is labeled 1. Then the vertical line in column 7 is labeled 4. The horizontal line in row 7 is labeled 2. Hmm. Maybe the vertical line in column 7 is a continuation from the horizontal line in row 7, which is labeled 2. But why is the vertical line labeled 4?\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's try a different approach. Let's look at the positions where the 5s are in the input and see how they map to the output numbers.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow 1, column 1 is 5 \u2192 output 1.\n\nRow 2, column 1 is 5 \u2192 output 1. Row 2, column 4 is 5 \u2192 output 4.\n\nRow 3, column 1 \u2192 1, column 4 \u21924.\n\nRow 4, column 1 \u21921, column 4 \u21924, column 7 \u21922.\n\nSo the 5s in column 1 are all 1. The 5s in column 4 are 4. The 5s in column 7 are 2.\n\nIn the input, the column 1 5s form a vertical line. Columns 4 and 7 are also vertical lines. Wait, but in the input, columns 4 and 7 have vertical lines as well. So why are they labeled 4 and 2?\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are based on the order in which the vertical lines are encountered. The first vertical line (column 1) is 1, the next (column4) is 4, then column7 is 2. That doesn't make sense. Or maybe the columns' positions modulo something. Column1 is 1, column4 is 4, column7 is 2 (mod 5? 7 mod 5 is 2). Hmm, possible. But in Example 1, column4's vertical line is labeled 1, column0's horizontal line is 4, column7 is 2. So column4 is 4 mod5 is 4. But in Example1, column4 is labeled 1. So that theory is invalid.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output numbers are determined by the order in which the lines are processed. For example, the first line encountered (top-leftmost) is labeled 1, next is 2, etc. But in Example 0, the column1 line is labeled 1, column4 line is 4, column7 is 2. So that's not the order.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are based on the direction of the line relative to the main line. Like, the main line is labeled 1, branches to the left are 4, to the right are 2. In Example 0, the column1 line is the main, column4 branches left (so 4), column7 branches right (2). That makes sense. Similarly, in Example 1, column4 is the main (1), column0 branches left (4), column7 branches right (2).\n\nIn Example 3, the vertical line in column7 is main (1), the horizontal lines in rows2 and5 branch left (4) or maybe right. But in row2, the horizontal line is to the left of the vertical line (column7 is vertical, row2's horizontal is columns1-4, which are left of column7). So that would be left branch, labeled 4. Then in row5, the horizontal line is columns1-5, which are left of column7, so also 4. But in the output, row5's horizontal line is labeled 4, which matches. The vertical line in column7 is labeled 1, which is the main.\n\nIn Example 2, the horizontal line in row2 (columns0-5) is the main line (labeled 1), then the vertical line in column7 (rows3-7) is a branch to the right (so 2?), but in the output it's labeled 4. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the horizontal line in row7 (columns2-4) is a branch from the vertical line in column7, but that line is labeled 2. Hmm. This is getting a bit inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main line is the longest line, and others are branches. But in Example 0, the column1 line is longer (6 cells) than column4 (3 cells) and column7 (3 cells). So main line is column1 (1), branches are left (column4 \u21924) and right (column7 \u21922). That fits. In Example1, column4's vertical line is the main (1), left branch (column0's horizontal) is 4, right branch (column7) is 2. In Example3, the main line is column7's vertical (1), left branches (horizontal lines) are 4. \n\nIn Example2, the horizontal line in row2 is the main line (1). Then the vertical line in column7 (rows3-7) is a branch. Since column7 is to the right of the main line (columns0-5), perhaps it's a right branch, which would be labeled 2. But in the output, that vertical line is labeled 4. Wait, that's conflicting. So maybe this theory is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, the direction of the branch relative to the main line's direction. For example, if the main line is vertical, a branch to the left would be labeled 4, right 2. If the main line is horizontal, a branch upward/downward would be labeled differently. \n\nIn Example2, the main line is horizontal (row2, columns0-5). Then the vertical line in column7 is a branch to the right (since main line is horizontal, a vertical branch could be considered as a turn. But the vertical line in column7 is labeled 4, which would imply a left branch, but it's to the right of the main line. Hmm. This seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the labels are determined by the order in which the branches are encountered. For example, the main line is 1, the first branch is 2, next is 4, etc. But in Example0, main line is 1, then the next branch (column4) is 4, then column7 is 2. That doesn't follow order. \n\nAnother idea: The output numbers could be counting the number of connected 5s in the same direction. For example, vertical lines are counted as 1 per cell, horizontal lines as 2 or 4 based on direction. But I'm not seeing a direct count here.\n\nWait, let's look at the positions of the output numbers. In Example0, the vertical line in column1 is labeled 1. The horizontal line in column4 is labeled 4. The horizontal line in column7 is labeled 2. Notice that column4 is to the left of the main line (column1), column7 to the right. So maybe left branches are 4, right branches are 2, main line is 1. This pattern holds across the examples.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nMain line is column4 (vertical, labeled 1). Left branch (column0, horizontal) is 4. Right branch (column7, horizontal) is 2. Yes.\n\nExample3:\n\nMain line is column7 (vertical, labeled 1). Left branches (horizontal lines to the left) are labeled 4 and 4. So this fits.\n\nExample2:\n\nMain line is row2 (horizontal, labeled 1). Then, in column7 (right side) there's a vertical line labeled 4. Wait, that's a right branch but labeled 4. Contradicts previous pattern. Unless the main line's direction affects the branch labels. If the main line is horizontal, then a branch upwards or downwards is labeled differently. For example, if the main line is horizontal (left to right), then a branch upwards could be 4 and downwards 2. Or maybe the direction of the branch relative to the main line's direction.\n\nAlternatively, if the main line is horizontal (left to right), then a branch going upwards would be 4, and downwards 2. But in Example2, the main line is horizontal (row2), and the vertical branch in column7 is going downwards (from row3 to row7). So maybe it's labeled 4 if it's going up, 2 if going down. Wait, in Example2, the vertical line in column7 starts at row3 and goes down to row7. So it's a downward branch from the main line (which is in row2). So maybe that's labeled 2. But in the output, it's labeled 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler pattern. Let's look at the output numbers again. They are 1, 2, 4. These are powers of 2. Maybe each number represents a different type of line:\n\n- 1: vertical line\n- 2: horizontal line (right)\n- 4: horizontal line (left)\n\nBut in Example0, the column4's vertical line is labeled 4. That contradicts, because it's vertical. Unless there's another rule. Maybe when a vertical line is a branch from a main vertical line, it's labeled differently. Or maybe the direction is determined by the position relative to the previous line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are assigned based on the cell's position in a chain. For example, the first cell in a line is 1, then the next cells are also 1 if continuing in the same direction. If there's a turn, the direction changes the number. For example, turning right becomes 2, left becomes 4. But how would that work for straight lines?\n\nIn Example0's column1, all cells are 1. So straight vertical line is 1. Then in column4, which is a vertical line, why is it 4? That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are determined by the direction of the line's extension. For example, if a vertical line is extended downward, it's 1. If a line branches to the left, it's 4, to the right it's 2. But in Example0's column4, which is a vertical line, why is it 4? Unless that line is a branch to the left from the main vertical line. For example, from the main column1 line, branching to column4 (to the right) would be 2, but in Example0, column4 is to the right of column1, but labeled 4. That contradicts.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to see if there's another pattern. Let's compare input and output for each example cell by cell.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput row 1 has a 5 in column1 \u2192 output 1.\n\nRow2, column1: 5 \u21921.\n\nRow2, column4:5 \u21924.\n\nRow4, column7:5 \u21922.\n\nSo the vertical line in column1 is 1s. The vertical line in column4 (rows2-4) is 4s. The vertical line in column7 (rows4-6) is 2s.\n\nSo maybe the direction is determined by the column's position modulo 3. Column1 mod3 is 1 \u21921. Column4 mod3 is 1 \u21924? No. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the output number is the column index modulo 4. Column1:1 \u21921. Column4:4 mod4=0 \u2192 but it's 4. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are based on the order in which the columns are encountered. For example, the first vertical line is column1 (1), then column4 (4), then column7 (7 mod5=2). But 7 mod5 is 2. So 2. That could fit. In Example0, column1:1, column4:4 mod5=4, column7:7 mod5=2. But why mod5? Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the output numbers in each example, the sum of the numbers in the output is:\n\nExample0: several 1s, 4s, 2s. Maybe the numbers are identifiers for distinct regions. Each contiguous region of 5s is assigned a unique number. But in Example0, the column1, column4, and column7 are separate regions. But they are assigned 1,4,2. So why not 1,2,3? Unless the numbers are assigned based on the region's position. Like, first region is 1, second is 2, third is4. But that doesn't follow sequence.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are assigned based on the region's size. Larger regions get higher numbers. But in Example0, column1's region is larger (6 cells) and is labeled 1, while smaller regions (column4 and7 have 3 cells each) are labeled4 and2. So size doesn't dictate it.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern based on the examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow8: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOther rows are 0s.\n\nSo in the test input, there are two main regions:\n\n1. A vertical line in column3 (rows1-3).\n\n2. A horizontal line in row5, columns4-9.\n\n3. A horizontal line in row8, columns0-4.\n\nNow, based on the examples, how would these be transformed?\n\nFor the vertical line in column3:\n\nIn Example0, vertical lines are labeled 1. In Example1, the vertical line in column4 is labeled1. So this vertical line would likely be labeled1.\n\nThe horizontal line in row5 (columns4-9) is a horizontal line to the right. In Example0, the horizontal line in column7 (right of main vertical) is labeled2. In Example1, the horizontal line to the right (column7) is labeled2. So this line in row5 would likely be labeled2.\n\nThe horizontal line in row8, columns0-4 is a horizontal line to the left. In Example0, the horizontal line in column4 (left of main vertical) is labeled4. Example1's left horizontal line is labeled4. So this line would be labeled4.\n\nSo the output for the test input would have:\n\n- In rows1-3, column3: 1s.\n\n- In row5, columns4-9: 2s.\n\n- In row8, columns0-4:4s.\n\nLet me check if this matches the examples' pattern.\n\nYes. For example, in Example3, the horizontal line in row5 (columns1-5) is labeled4. That's a horizontal line to the left of the vertical line in column7. So labeled4. The horizontal line in row2 (columns1-4) is labeled2, which is a horizontal line to the left of the vertical line. Wait, no. In Example3, the vertical line is in column7. So the horizontal lines in row2 (columns1-4) are to the left of column7, hence labeled4. But in the output, they are labeled2. That contradicts. Wait, in Example3's output, the horizontal line in row2 is labeled2, and the one in row5 is labeled4. Hmm. So why the difference?\n\nWait, maybe the direction of the horizontal line (left to right vs. right to left) matters. For example, if the horizontal line starts from the left and goes right, it's labeled2. If it starts from the right and goes left, it's labeled4. Or perhaps it's based on which side of the main vertical line they are on.\n\nIn Example3's input:\n\nThe vertical line is column7. The horizontal line in row2 is columns1-4 (left of column7), so labeled2. The horizontal line in row5 is columns1-5 (also left of column7) labeled4. So why the difference? That's confusing. Unless the labels are based on the order of discovery. The first horizontal line to the left is 2, the next is4. But that doesn't fit the other examples.\n\nAlternatively, the horizontal line in row2 of Example3 is connected to the vertical line via a turn. Let's see: the vertical line is in column7, rows1-7. The horizontal line in row2 is columns1-4. There's no connection between them. So they're separate regions. But in the output, the horizontal line in row2 is labeled2, which in previous examples was used for right branches. This is inconsistent.\n\nThis suggests that my initial hypothesis might be incorrect. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, looking back at Example3's output:\n\nThe vertical line in column7 is labeled1. The horizontal line in row2 is labeled2, and the one in row5 is labeled4. So why are they different? The horizontal line in row2 is length 4, row5 is length5. Could it be based on even and odd lengths? 4 is even \u21924, 5 is odd \u21924? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal lines are labeled based on their row index. For example, row2 is even-numbered (0-indexed) so labeled2. Row5 is odd-numbered (row index4 is even, row5 is index5 which is odd?), so labeled4. But in Example0, the horizontal line in row4 is labeled4, which is even index. So that theory doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the horizontal lines are labeled based on their position relative to the main line's row. The main line in Example3 is column7's vertical. The horizontal line in row2 is above it, and labeled2. The horizontal line in row5 is below, labeled4. But in Example0, the horizontal lines are in the same rows as the main vertical line. Not sure.\n\nThis is really tricky. Given the time I have, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis: main vertical lines are labeled1, horizontal branches to the right are2, to the left are4. For the test input:\n\nVertical line in column3 (rows1-3) \u2192 labeled1.\n\nHorizontal line in row5 (columns4-9) is to the right of the vertical line \u2192 labeled2.\n\nHorizontal line in row8 (columns0-4) is to the left of the vertical line \u2192 labeled4. But the vertical line is in column3, and row8's horizontal line is columns0-4, which is to the left of column3. So labeled4.\n\nBut wait, the horizontal line in row8 is not connected to the vertical line. So it's a separate region. Maybe it's considered a main line itself, so labeled1. But in Example2, the horizontal line in row2 is labeled1, and it's the main line. So maybe the test input's row8 horizontal line is a main line and labeled1. But in that case, the vertical line in column3 would be labeled4 or2. But according to the examples, the first encountered line is the main line.\n\nThe test input's vertical line in column3 is in rows1-3, which are earlier than row5 and row8. So it would be the main line labeled1. The horizontal line in row5 (columns4-9) is to the right of the vertical line (column3), so labeled2. The horizontal line in row8 (columns0-4) is to the left of the vertical line, so labeled4.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\nFor the vertical line in column3, rows1-3: 1.\n\nFor the horizontal line in row5, columns4-9:2.\n\nFor the horizontal line in row8, columns0-4:4.\n\nSo the test input's output should be:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow8: [4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOther rows remain 0.\n\nLet's check if this fits the pattern of the examples. For example, in Example2, the horizontal line in row2 is labeled1 (main line), and the horizontal line in row7 is labeled2 (right branch?), even though it's not connected. But in the output, it's labeled2. So the test input's row5 is labeled2 as a right branch, row8 is labeled4 as a left branch. That seems to fit.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples. Let me start by looking at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a bunch of 5s arranged in certain positions. The output replaces those 5s with numbers like 1, 4, and 2. Let's see where those replacements happen. In the input's second row, there's a 5 in position [1][1], and the output replaces that with 1. Then, in row 2, there's a 5 at [2][4], which becomes 4. Similarly, in row 4, the 5s at [4][7] become 2. Hmm, maybe the value depends on the number of adjacent 5s?\n\nWait, let's check the positions. The 1 in example 0's output is in a cell that has a 5 in the input. Maybe it's counting the number of adjacent 5s? Let's see. The cell at (1,1) in input has a 5. Let's check its neighbors. Up, down, left, right? Let's see. The cell (1,1) is in row 1 (assuming rows start at 0). The cells around it: (0,1) is 0, (2,1) is 5, (1,0) is 0, (1,2) is 0. So it has one adjacent 5 (below it). But in the output, it's 1. Wait, but maybe the count includes the cell itself? Or maybe it's the number of connected 5s in a vertical line?\n\nLooking at example 0's input, the 5s in column 1 (rows 1-6) are vertical. The output for those cells is 1 in the first row (row 1), 1 in row 2, etc. Except the ones in row 4,5,6 which have 4 and 2. Wait, maybe the numbers represent something else, like layers or steps.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs: 1, 4, 2. Maybe 1 is the start of a vertical line, 4 is a middle part, and 2 is the end. Let's check. In example 0's input, the vertical line of 5s in column 1 runs from row 1 to row 6. The output replaces the first cell (row 1, column1) with 1, then the next four (rows 2-5) with 4, and the last one (row6?) Wait no. Wait the output in row 4 has a 1, but then 4 and 2. Wait, maybe not. Let me check the actual input and output again.\n\nIn Example 0 input:\n\nRow 1 (second row): 5 at position 1.\n\nOutput row1: 1 at position1.\n\nInput row2: 5 at position1 and 4.\n\nOutput row2: 1 at 1, 4 at 4.\n\nInput row4: 5s at positions1,4,7.\n\nOutput row4: 1 at1, 4 at4, 2 at7.\n\nHmm, maybe the numbers correspond to the count of how many times that 5 is part of a vertical or horizontal line. Or perhaps it's the length of the vertical line segment each 5 is part of. For example, in the first column (column1), the vertical line is 6 cells long (rows1-6). But in the output, the first cell is 1, then the next four are 4, then the last one is 2? That doesn't add up. Maybe each vertical line is split into segments where the top is 1, the middle parts are 4, and the bottom is 2. Let's see.\n\nIn example0's column1: rows1-6 are 5s. The output replaces row1 with 1, rows2-5 with 4, and row6 with 1 again? Wait no, in the output for example0's row6, column1 is still 1. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers represent how many 5s are adjacent in the same column. Like, a single 5 (no others above or below) becomes 1. If there are multiple consecutive 5s in the same column, the top one is 1, the middle ones 4, and the bottom one 2. Let's check.\n\nIn example0, column1's 5s start at row1 and go down to row6. So the top (row1) is 1, the next four (rows2-5) are 4, and the bottom (row6) is 1. But in the output, row6's column1 is still 1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait in example0's output, rows1-6 column1 are all 1 except row4. Wait no, the output for column1 in example0 is 1 in all rows except rows4-6 where it's 1? Wait looking back:\n\nOutput for example0:\n\nRow1: [0,1,0,...]\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,...]\n\nRow3: [0,1,0,...]\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,...]\n\nRow5: [0,1,0,...]\n\nRow6: [0,1,0,...]\n\nWait no, the output rows for column1 (position1) are all 1 in rows1-6. Then in column4 (position4), row2 has 4, rows3-4 have 4, and column7 (position7) in rows4-6 have 2. Wait that might be different. For example, in the input's column4, rows2-4 have 5s. The output's column4: row2 is 4, row3 is4, row4 is4. So maybe if a vertical line of 5s is longer than 1, the middle ones become 4. But how are the top and bottom determined? Because in column7 of the input (rows4-6), there's 5s. The output's column7 in rows4-6 is 2. So maybe the vertical lines of 5s are being labeled as 1 for the top, 4 for the middle, and 2 for the bottom. Let's check:\n\nIn example0:\n\n- Column1 has 5s from row1 to row6. So top is row1, bottom is row6. But output for all those rows is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's look at example1. Input has a vertical line starting at row1, column4 (5s in rows1-2 and then rows3-6 in column4). The output for column4 in row1 is 1, row2 is 1, row3-5 are 1, row6? Wait example1's input column4 has 5s in rows1-6. The output for column4 in example1 is:\n\nRow1: 1\n\nRow2: 1\n\nRow3: 1 (but input here is 5). Wait no. Wait the example1's input column4 has:\n\nRow1 (input) column4 is 5 (output 1)\n\nRow2 (input) column4 is 5 (output 1)\n\nRow3 (input) column4 is 5 (output 1)\n\nRow4 (input) column4 is 5 (output 1)\n\nRow5 (input) column4 is 5 (output 1)\n\nRow6 (input) column4 is 5 (output 1)\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait example1's input is:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,5,...]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,5,...]\n\nRow3: [0,5,0,0,5,...]\n\nRow4: [0,5,0,0,5,...]\n\nRow5: [0,5,0,0,5,...]\n\nRow6: [0,5,0,0,5,...]\n\nSo column4 in input has 5s from row1 to row6. The output for column4 in example1's output is:\n\nRow1: 1\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:1 (but in output example1's row5, column4 is 1, and column7 is 2)\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at this wrong. Let me recheck the example1 output:\n\nExample1 output:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,4,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0]\n\n[0,4,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nSo in column4 (index4), rows1-6 are all 1. But column1 (index1) in rows3-6 have 4s. So the 5s in column1 (rows3-6) of the input become 4s, except maybe the top and bottom. But in the output, row3 column1 is 4, row4 is4, row5 is4, row6 is4. Wait, but in the input, column1's 5s start at row3 and go down to row6. So in the output, all those are 4s. Hmm. But in example0, the column1's 5s are all 1s. So this seems inconsistent. Maybe there's another factor.\n\nLooking at example2's input: row2 has a horizontal line of 5s (columns0-5). The output for that row is all 1s. Then in row7, there's a horizontal line of 5s (columns2-4). The output for those is 2. Also, column7 in rows3-6 and row7 has 5s. The output for column7 in row3 is 4, rows4-6 are 4, row7 is4. Wait, perhaps horizontal lines are treated differently than vertical lines.\n\nIn example2's input, the horizontal line at row2 (columns0-5) of 5s becomes all 1s in the output. Then in row7, columns2-4 are 5s and become 2s. Hmm. Maybe the direction (horizontal vs vertical) affects the number. Also, looking at example3's output: the vertical line in column7 (rows1-7) becomes 1s, except in row5 where there's a horizontal line. Wait example3's input has a vertical line in column7 from row1 to row7. The output for column7 in rows1-7 is all 1s except in row5 where there's a horizontal line of 5s. The output for that horizontal line in row5 is 4s. So maybe horizontal lines are replaced with 4s, but vertical lines start with 1, then 4, then 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number depends on the position within a group. For example, in a vertical group of 5s, the first cell is 1, middle cells 4, last cell 2. In a horizontal group, leftmost is 1, middle 4, rightmost 2.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with example0. In example0's input, column1 has 5s from row1 to row6. If vertical, the first (row1) would be 1, middle (rows2-5) 4, last (row6) 2. But in the output, all are 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait in example0's output, the vertical line in column1 is all 1s. Hmm. Then maybe vertical lines are all 1s. But that doesn't fit example1's column1, which in the input has a vertical line from row3 to row6, and output is 4s. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait in example1's input, column4 (5s from row1 to row6) and in output, column4 is all 1s. But column1 in example1's input has 5s from row3 to row6, and output is 4s. So why is column4 all 1s but column1 4s?\n\nHmm. Let's look at the example1's input again. The 5s in column4 start at row1 and continue to row6, so a vertical line of 6. The output is all 1s. The 5s in column1 (rows3-6) in example1's input become 4s. So perhaps the vertical lines that are part of a longer vertical line are 1s, but vertical lines that are part of a different structure (like connected to a horizontal line) become 4s. Wait, maybe the vertical lines in example1's column1 are connected to a horizontal line in row3 (the input row3 has a 5 at column1 and column4). So maybe when a vertical line is connected to a horizontal line, the vertical parts become 4s, while standalone vertical lines are 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers correspond to the number of directions in which the 5 is connected. For example, a 5 that is part of a vertical line but also connected to a horizontal line would have more connections. Or maybe the number represents the number of adjacent 5s in certain directions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output numbers are encoding the shape of the connected regions. For instance, 1 could be a vertical line start, 2 vertical line end, 4 horizontal segments. But in example3's output, there's a horizontal line (row5) that's replaced with 4s, and another vertical line in column7 with 1s. The horizontal line in row5 has 5s in columns1-5, and the output replaces them with 4s. Also, the vertical line in column7 (rows1-7) is replaced with 1s except row5 where it's part of the horizontal line. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is counting the number of 5s in the same row or column, but that's unclear. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLooking at example3's input and output. The input has a vertical line in column7 (rows1-7) and horizontal lines in rows2 (columns1-4), row5 (columns1-5). The output for column7's vertical line (excluding row5) is 1, and in row5 (the horizontal part) it's 4. So perhaps when a vertical line is interrupted by a horizontal line, the horizontal part is 4. The vertical parts that are standalone are 1. The horizontal line in row5 is replaced with 4s. Then in example3's row5, the horizontal line is 5s, output is 4s.\n\nAnother idea: the output numbers represent the number of adjacent 5s in specific directions. For example, a cell with 5 in input is replaced by the number of adjacent 5s plus one. But in example0, the cell (1,1) has a 5 in input and is replaced by 1. Its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are 0, 5 (down), 0, 0. So two adjacent 5s? No. Wait, in example0's cell (1,1), down is 5 (row2, column1), but the other directions are 0. So only one adjacent 5. But output is 1. Hmm, maybe the count is the number of adjacent 5s. Then 1 adjacent would become 1. But in example0's cell (2,1), which is 5 in input, has 5s above (row1) and below (row3). So two adjacent 5s, but output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers in the output might represent the type of the cell in a certain structure. For example, 1 could be an endpoint of a line, 4 a middle part, and 2 another type. Let's think of the vertical line in example0's column1: all cells are 1. But in example1's column1 (rows3-6), all are 4. So why the difference? Maybe in example0's column1, the line is vertical and standalone, but in example1's column1, the line is part of a T-junction. For example, in example1's row3, column1 has a 5 and column4 has a 5, so maybe it's a T-junction, making the vertical line part of a more complex structure, hence 4s instead of 1s.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's look for a pattern that can explain all examples.\n\nAnother approach: let's note the output numbers and see where they appear.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\n1 appears in vertical lines (example0 column1, example1 column4, example3 column7), but also in example2's horizontal line in row2 (outputs are 1s). Wait, example2's row2 has a horizontal line of 5s, output is 1s. But example3's row5 horizontal line is replaced with 4s. So why the difference? Because in example2, the horizontal line is at the top (row2) and maybe is a standalone line, while in example3's row5, the horizontal line is connected to a vertical line (column7) which is 1s. So maybe horizontal lines that are standalone become 1s, but horizontal lines connected to vertical lines become 4s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction of the line matters. If the line is horizontal, the leftmost cell is 1, middle 4, rightmost 2. For vertical lines, top is 1, middle 4, bottom 2. Let's test this.\n\nIn example2's input, row2 has a horizontal line of 6 5s. The output replaces them all with 1s. But according to the hypothesis, the leftmost would be 1, middle 4, rightmost 2. But they're all 1s. So that doesn't fit. Unless the line is considered to be connected to something else.\n\nWait example2's input has a horizontal line in row2 (columns0-5) and another vertical line in column7 (rows3-7). The horizontal line's output is 1s. The vertical line in column7 (rows3-7) outputs 4s except for row7, which has a horizontal line (columns2-4) in input. The output for row7's horizontal line is 2s. Hmm.\n\nIn example2's output, row2's horizontal line is 1s. Then in row7, columns2-4 (input 5s) are output 2s. The vertical line in column7 (input rows3-6) are output 4s. So maybe vertical lines in the middle of other structures are 4s, and horizontal lines at the end are 2s.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example0's output:\n\nThe 5s in column1 (vertical) are all 1s.\n\nThe 5s in column4 (vertical) are 4 in row2-3, and 4 in row4-6.\n\nWait no, in example0's input, column4 has 5s in row2,3,4. Output in column4, row2 is4, row3 is4, row4 is4. Then in column7, rows4-6 (input 5s) are output 2s. So maybe when a vertical line has a 5 that is the end (like the last in the column), it's replaced with 2. But in example0's column4, the 5s stop at row4. So row4's column4 is 4, but the next row (row5) has no 5. So maybe row4 is the end, thus 2. But in output, it's 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the output number is determined by the number of 5s in the same row and column. For example, if a cell is part of a vertical line of length n, the output is n. But example0's column1 has length 6, but outputs 1. No.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers could be based on the position in a sequence. For example, in a vertical line, the first cell is 1, then next four are 4, then last is 2. But in example0's column1 has six 5s, output all 1s, which doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: in example3's output, the horizontal line in row5 (columns1-5) is replaced with 4s. The vertical line in column7 (rows1-7) is replaced with 1s except where it intersects with the horizontal line (row5, column7) which is part of the vertical line but also the horizontal. So maybe when a cell is part of both a vertical and horizontal line, it's assigned a different number. But in example3's output, row5, column7 is 1, same as the vertical line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers represent the count of 5s in the same group. For instance, if a group of connected 5s (vertically or horizontally) has a certain size, the numbers are assigned based on that. But in example0, the vertical line in column1 has 6 cells, but output is 1s. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output numbers are based on the number of turns made in the path. For example, a straight vertical line has no turns and is labeled 1, 4, 2. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps each 5 in the input is replaced by a number that indicates the number of adjacent 5s in specific directions. For example:\n\n- 1 if there's a 5 below but not above (start of vertical line)\n- 2 if there's a 5 above but not below (end of vertical line)\n- 4 if there are 5s both above and below (middle of vertical line)\n- Similarly for horizontal lines, but maybe using left/right.\n\nBut let's check.\n\nTake example0's column1:\n\nRow1 (5) has a 5 below (row2), no 5 above. So it would be 1. Which matches the output.\n\nRow2 (5) has a 5 above (row1) and below (row3). So 4. But in the output, it's 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. That's a problem. Maybe considering only the vertical direction. Or perhaps the numbers are for horizontal lines.\n\nWait, perhaps for vertical lines, 1 is top, 4 is middle, 2 is bottom. For horizontal lines, 1 is left, 4 middle, 2 right.\n\nIn example0's column1 (vertical line from row1 to row6), all cells would be 1 (top), but since it's a long line, maybe the middle parts are 4. But the output is all 1s. Doesn't fit.\n\nIn example1's column4 (vertical line from row1 to row6), all output is 1. So perhaps vertical lines are all 1s regardless of length. But example1's column1 (vertical line from row3 to row6) outputs 4s. So why the difference?\n\nWait, example1's column4's vertical line is part of a larger structure. Maybe if a vertical line is connected to horizontal lines, it's treated differently. For example, in example1's column4, there are horizontal lines in row3 (columns1 and 4 have 5s). So the vertical line in column4 is connected to a horizontal line in row3. But the output for column4's vertical line is all 1s. The vertical line in column1 (rows3-6) is connected to horizontal lines in row3 (column1 and 4), row4 (same), etc. The output for column1 is 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical lines that are connected to horizontal lines on both ends are labeled 4, while standalone vertical lines are 1. But in example1's column4 is connected to a horizontal line (row3, column1 and 4), but the vertical line in column4 is labeled 1. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are determined by the number of adjacent 5s in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). Let's test this:\n\nFor example0's cell (1,1):\n\nAdjacent 5s: down (row2, col1). So count is 1. Output is 1.\n\nCell (2,1) in example0's input has adjacent 5s: up (row1) and down (row3). So count is 2. But output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output number is the sum of directions where there's a 5. For example, up=1, down=2, left=4, right=8. Then the sum gives a unique number. But for cell (1,1) in example0, down is present, so sum=2. But output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers could represent directions. For example, 1 is down, 4 is right, 2 is up. But not sure.\n\nLooking back at the test input:\n\nTest input has:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,5,0,...]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,5,0,...]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,5,0,...]\n\nRow4: all zeros.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow8: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo vertical line in column3, rows1-3. Then horizontal line in row5, columns4-9. And a horizontal line in row8, columns0-4.\n\nSo applying the pattern from the examples:\n\n- The vertical line in column3 (rows1-3) might be replaced with 1s. But in example1, a vertical line of three 5s (rows1-3) in column4 becomes 1s. So maybe this vertical line becomes 1 in the first row, 4 in the middle, and 2 in the last. Wait example1's column4 has 5s from row1 to row6, and all output 1s. So perhaps vertical lines of any length are replaced with 1s. But example1's column1 (rows3-6) has 4s.\n\nAlternatively, considering the vertical line in the test input's column3 (rows1-3), perhaps the first cell (row1) is 1, the middle (row2) 4, and last (row3) 2. But in example1's column4, the first cell is 1, and all others are 1. So that's conflicting.\n\nThe horizontal line in row5 (columns4-9) of the test input would need to be replaced. Looking at example2's row2 horizontal line (columns0-5) becomes 1s. Example3's row5 horizontal line (columns1-5) becomes 4s. So why the difference? Maybe because in example3's row5, the horizontal line is connected to a vertical line (column7), but in example2's row2, it's standalone. So for the test input's row5, the horizontal line is standalone. So perhaps it becomes 1s. But example2's row2's horizontal line becomes 1s. So perhaps the test's row5 would be replaced with 1s. However, in example3's row5, the horizontal line becomes 4s, perhaps because it's connected to a vertical line. So the test's row5 line is standalone, so 1s.\n\nThen the horizontal line in row8 (columns0-4) of the test input. Example2's row7's horizontal line (columns2-4) becomes 2s. Example3's row5's horizontal line (connected to vertical) becomes 4s. So perhaps standalone horizontal lines have the leftmost as 1, middle 4, rightmost 2. But example2's row2's horizontal line is all 1s. So maybe the length of the horizontal line determines this. Example2's row2 has 6 5s, all replaced with 1s. Test's row5 has 6 5s (columns4-9), so maybe all 1s. The test's row8 has 5 5s (columns0-4), so perhaps 1,4,4,4,2?\n\nBut example2's row7's horizontal line has 3 5s (columns2-4), replaced with 2s. Hmm, that's inconsistent. Maybe the direction or connection affects it.\n\nAnother idea: for horizontal lines, the leftmost cell is 1, middle cells 4, rightmost 2. But if the line is only one cell, it's 1. For example, in example2's row2, all are 1s. But that's a horizontal line of 6 cells. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, if the line is longer than 3 cells, all middle cells become 4. So leftmost 1, rightmost 2, and middle 4s. For example, a line of 5 cells would be 1,4,4,4,2. So test's row5 has 6 cells: 1,4,4,4,4,2. Row8 has 5 cells: 1,4,4,4,2.\n\nBut how does this match the training examples? In example2's row7's horizontal line of 3 cells (columns2-4), output is 2s. That doesn't fit. So perhaps this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are based on whether the cell is the first, last, or middle in the horizontal line. For example, if it's a horizontal line, the first cell is 1, middle 4, last 2. For vertical line, first is 1, middle 4, last 2. Let's check:\n\nExample0's column1 (vertical line of 6 cells) would be 1 (row1), 4 (rows2-5), 2 (row6). But output for all is 1. So no.\n\nExample2's row2 (horizontal line of 6 cells) would be 1 (column0), 4 (columns1-4), 2 (column5). But output is all 1s. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at example3's output:\n\nRow5's horizontal line (columns1-5) is replaced with 4s. The vertical line in column7 is replaced with 1s. So perhaps when a cell is part of both a vertical and horizontal line, it's considered part of the vertical line. But in row5, column7 is part of the vertical line and the horizontal line. The output is 1, so it's part of the vertical line.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps each 5 is replaced by the count of how many adjacent 5s are in the same direction. For example, vertical line cells have their count based on vertical neighbors, horizontal based on horizontal neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers represent the number of continuous 5s in the same row or column. For example, if a cell is part of a vertical line of 3 cells, it's replaced with 3. But example0's column1 has 6 cells, output is 1. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers could represent the sum of the positions of the 5s in their group. But that seems unlikely.\n\nLet me think again. Looking at example0 and example1's outputs:\n\nExample0's vertical line in column1 is all 1s. Example1's vertical line in column4 is all 1s, but vertical line in column1 (rows3-6) is 4s. What's the difference between these two lines? In example0, the vertical line is isolated (no horizontal connections), while in example1's column1, the vertical line starts at row3 and is connected to a horizontal line in row3 (columns1 and 4). So maybe when a vertical line starts with a horizontal connection, it's labeled 4.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical lines in example1's column1 are part of a larger structure. Perhaps the numbers represent the order in which the lines are processed. Like, the first vertical line encountered is 1, the next 2, etc. But this would not be deterministic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers represent the count of horizontal and vertical lines each cell is part of. For example, if a cell is part of both a vertical and horizontal line, it's 4. If only vertical, 1. If only horizontal, 2. But example3's row5, columns1-5 are part of a horizontal line and the vertical line in column7 is not connected. So they would be 2. But example3's row5, columns1-5 are replaced with 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in example3's output, the horizontal line in row5 (columns1-5) is replaced with 4s. Maybe 4 indicates a horizontal line. Vertical lines are 1, horizontal are 4. But example0's vertical lines are 1, example1's column4 vertical line is 1. example1's column1 vertical line is 4. So why the difference?\n\nMaybe in example1's column1, the vertical line is part of a T-junction (connected to a horizontal line), so it's labeled 4. While standalone vertical lines are 1. Then, in the test input's column3 (rows1-3), which is a standalone vertical line, they would become 1, 4, 2. But example1's column4 vertical line is connected to horizontal lines, but it's labeled 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to find a different angle.\n\nLooking at the outputs for vertical lines:\n\nIn example0's column1: all 1s.\n\nIn example1's column4: all 1s.\n\nIn example1's column1 (rows3-6): all 4s.\n\nIn example2's column7 (rows3-6): 4s.\n\nIn example3's column7 (rows1-7 except row5): 1s.\n\nIn example3's row5, columns1-5: 4s.\n\nHmm. The 4s appear in vertical lines that are part of a horizontal connection (like example1's column1 and example2's column7) and in horizontal lines (example3's row5). The 1s are in standalone vertical lines (example0's column1, example1's column4). The 2s are in horizontal lines (example0's column7, example2's row7).\n\nAlternatively, 1 represents vertical lines, 4 represents horizontal lines, and 2 represents intersections or turns. But example0's column7 has 2s, which are vertical lines. So that's not it.\n\nAnother possibility: the numbers are related to the ASCII values of characters. 1 is '1' (49), 4 is '4' (52), 2 is '2' (50). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers might represent the number of 5s in a cross shape. For example, a cell with 5 in input and two adjacent 5s vertically would be 4. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are encoding the path of the lines. For example, 1 is start, 2 is end, 4 is middle. For example, in a vertical line, the top is 1, middle 4, bottom 2. For a horizontal line, left is 1, middle 4, right is 2. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's column1 vertical line: rows1-6. So top is row1 (1), rows2-5 (4), row6 (2). But the output is all 1s. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's column4 vertical line: rows1-6. So top (row1) is 1, middle rows 2-5 are 4, row6 is 2. Output is all 1s. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's row2 horizontal line (columns0-5): left is 0 (1), columns1-4 are 4, column5 is 2. Output is all 1s. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample3's row5 horizontal line (columns1-5): left (1) is 1, columns2-4 are 4, column5 is 2. Output is all 4s. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nLet's try to find a different approach. Maybe each 5 in the input is replaced with a number that indicates the number of continuous 5s in the same row and column. For example, if a cell is part of a vertical line of 3, it might be 3. But example0's column1 has 6, but output is 1. So no.\n\nAnother idea: the output numbers could be the count of the number of 5s in the same row and column. For example, in example0's column1, each cell has 5 in the column but only one in the row. So 5+1=6. But output is 1. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the sum of the number of 5s in the row and column. For example, in example0's row1, column1: row has one 5, column has six. 1+6=7. Output is 1. Not matching.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's look for another pattern. Maybe the output numbers are related to the positions of the 5s relative to the edges of the grid.\n\nFor example, in example0's column1, the vertical line is near the left edge. Maybe the number 1 represents left side. But example1's column4 is in the middle, output is 1. So that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers could be the sum of the row and column indices. For example, row1, column1: 1+1=2. Output is 1. No.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers could be assigned based on the parity of the sum of the row and column. But 1,4,2 don't follow parity.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output numbers are encoding the shape of the connected component. For example, 1 is a vertical line, 4 is a horizontal line, 2 is a turn. But example0's vertical line is all 1s, example1's vertical line is 1s and 4s, which contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, each number represents a different type of line segment:\n\n- 1: vertical line segment\n- 4: horizontal line segment\n- 2: end of a line\n\nBut in example0's column7 (rows4-6), the output is 2s. Those 5s are vertical. So why 2? Maybe they're the end of a vertical line. But they're in the middle of the grid. Alternatively, they could be the end of a horizontal line. But in example0's column7, there's no horizontal line.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. The output numbers could be based on whether the cell is the first, middle, or last in its connected component when traversed in a certain order. For example, a vertical line is traversed from top to bottom: first cell is 1, middle cells 4, last cell 2. Similarly for horizontal left to right.\n\nBut in example0's column1 vertical line (rows1-6), output is all 1s. So this would imply that the entire line is treated as first cells, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the traversal is row-wise. So when a vertical line is encountered during a row-wise scan, the first occurrence is 1, subsequent are 4, and the last is 2. But in example0's column1, the first occurrence is row1, so 1. Then row2 would be 4, etc. But output is all 1s. So no.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to look for a different approach. Maybe the output numbers are a code for the directions in which the 5s continue. For example:\n\n- 1: continues down\n- 4: continues right\n- 2: no continuation (end)\n\nBut then:\n\nExample0's cell (1,1) has a 5 below, so 1. Cell (2,1) has 5 above and below, so maybe 4 (indicating continues both ways?), but output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, using bitmasking:\n\n- up: 1\n- down: 2\n- left:4 \n- right:8\n\nSum the directions where there are 5s.\n\nExample0's cell (1,1) has down, so 2. Output is 1. Doesn't match.\n\nCell (2,1): up and down (1+2=3). Output 1. No.\n\nThis doesn't seem to work.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the numbers represent the number of 5s in a certain direction. For example, for vertical lines, the number indicates how many 5s are below (including itself). So a vertical line of 6 would have 6 in the top cell, decreasing by 1. But output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number is 1 for the first cell of a vertical line, 4 for middle, 2 for end. For horizontal lines, 1 for start, 4 middle, 2 end. But example0's vertical line would have 1, 4,4,4,4,2. But output is all 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the direction is different. For example, vertical lines are processed from bottom to top, and horizontal from right to left. But I can't see how that would help.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern in the output numbers:\n\nLooking at example0's output:\n\nRow2, column4 is 4. Input has 5s in row2-4 column4.\n\nRow4, column7 is 2. Input has 5s in row4-6 column7.\n\nExample1's output:\n\nRow3, column1 is4. Input has 5s from row3-6 column1.\n\nRow5, column7 is2. Input has 5s from row5-6 column7.\n\nExample2's output:\n\nRow7, columns2-4 are2. Input has 5s there.\n\nExample3's output:\n\nRow5, columns1-5 are4. Input has 5s there.\n\nSo perhaps 2 is used for the end of a horizontal line, and 4 for the middle. But example2's row7's horizontal line has 3 cells, all replaced with2s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are for horizontal lines that are at the bottom of the grid. But example0's column7's 2s are in the middle.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the pattern is that each 5 is replaced with a number that represents how many times it's part of a vertical or horizontal line. For example, 1 for vertical, 2 for horizontal, 4 for both. But example3's row5, column1-5 are part of a horizontal line, so replaced with4. But example2's row2 horizontal line is replaced with1s. So why the difference?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 4 is used for horizontal lines, 1 for vertical, and 2 for corners or intersections. But example3's row5, columns1-5 are horizontal, so replaced with4. Example2's row2 horizontal line is replaced with1s. So that's conflicting.\n\nMaybe the length of the line determines the number. If a line is longer than a certain length, it uses 4. For example, in example2's row2, a horizontal line of 6 cells becomes1s. Example3's row5 horizontal line of 5 cells becomes4s. Example0's vertical line of6 cells becomes1s. Example1's vertical line of6 cells becomes1s. So this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number is determined by the number of adjacent 5s in the same direction. For example, if a cell is part of a vertical line of 3 or more, the middle cells are4. But example0's vertical line of6 has all 1s. So that's not it.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find the pattern in a different way. Let's consider the training examples and see if there's a common transformation.\n\nIn example0's input:\n\nThe 5s form vertical lines in columns1,4,7. The output replaces column1 with1s, column4 with4s, and column7 with2s.\n\nIn example1's input:\n\nVertical lines in columns4 and7, and a vertical line in column1. Output: column4 is1s, column1 is4s, column7 is2s.\n\nExample2's input:\n\nHorizontal line in row2, vertical line in column7, and horizontal line in row7. Output: row2 is1s, column7 is4s, row7 is2s.\n\nExample3's input:\n\nVertical line in column7, horizontal lines in rows2 and5. Output: column7 is1s (except row5), row5's horizontal line is4s.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is:\n\n- Vertical lines are replaced with1s.\n\n- Horizontal lines are replaced with4s if they're part of a certain structure, or 1s otherwise.\n\n- The ends of horizontal lines are replaced with2s.\n\nBut in example0's column7, the vertical line is replaced with2s. Which contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, vertical lines are 1s, horizontal lines are4s, and their ends are2s.\n\nBut in example2's row7, horizontal line is replaced with2s. In example0's column7 (vertical) replaced with2s.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try to apply this pattern to the test input.\n\nTest input has:\n\n- Vertical line in column3 (rows1-3). Would be replaced with1s.\n\n- Horizontal line in row5 (columns4-9). Would be replaced with4s, ends with2.\n\n- Horizontal line in row8 (columns0-4). Would be replaced with4s, ends with2.\n\nBut in example2's row7, horizontal line of3 cells is replaced with2s. So perhaps any horizontal line, regardless of length, is replaced with2s. Or perhaps the direction matters.\n\nAlternatively, vertical lines are1s, horizontal lines are4s except the rightmost cell, which is2.\n\nIn test input's row5, columns4-9: each cell would be4 except the last (column9) which is2. Similarly, row8's columns0-4: each cell is4 except column4 is2.\n\nBut in example2's row2's horizontal line of6 cells (columns0-5), all are replaced with1s. So that contradicts.\n\nThis is really hard. Maybe the pattern is that each vertical line is replaced with1s, each horizontal line with4s, and any cell that is the end of a line (vertical or horizontal) is replaced with2. For example, the bottom of a vertical line is2, the right end of a horizontal line is2.\n\nIn example0's column7 (rows4-6), those are the end of a vertical line (assuming it's longer somewhere else?), but they are replaced with2s.\n\nIn example1's column7, the vertical line in rows5-6 is replaced with2s.\n\nIn example2's row7's horizontal line is replaced with2s (right end).\n\nIn example3's row5's horizontal line (columns1-5), the right end would be column5, replaced with2. But the output for row5 is all4s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI think I'm not going to find the exact pattern quickly. Perhaps I should look for a different angle. The output numbers 1,4,2 may correspond to letters A, D, B. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 1+4+2=7. Not helpful.\n\nWait, looking at the numbers: 1,4,2. Could they be the number of segments in a digital display? For example, 1 has two segments, 4 has four, 2 has five. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers represent arrows: 1 is up, 4 is left, 2 is down. But this is speculative.\n\nAnother idea: the numbers correspond to the number of 5s in the immediate vicinity. For example:\n\n- 1: one 5 adjacent (vertically or horizontally)\n- 4: four adjacent (like a cross)\n- 2: two adjacent.\n\nBut in example0's cell (1,1) has one adjacent 5 (below). Output is1. Cell (2,1) has two (up and down). Output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are the count of 5s in the same row and column. For example:\n\n- 1: one 5 in the row and column.\n- 4: four 5s in the row or column.\n- 2: two 5s.\n\nBut example0's column1 has six 5s in the column, so output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really difficult. Maybe I should give up and look for a pattern in the numbers. For instance, in example0's output:\n\n- Column1: all 1s.\n\n- Column4: 4s.\n\n- Column7: 2s.\n\nIn example1's output:\n\n- Column4:1s.\n\n- Column1:4s.\n\n- Column7:2s.\n\nIn example2's output:\n\n- Row2:1s.\n\n- Column7:4s.\n\n- Row7:2s.\n\nIn example3's output:\n\n- Column7:1s.\n\n- Row5:4s.\n\nSo perhaps 1,4,2 correspond to vertical, horizontal, and end. Or maybe the numbers are assigned based on the order of appearance. For example, the first type of line is 1, the second 4, the third 2.\n\nBut this is not consistent across examples. For example, in example0, vertical lines are 1, horizontal are4, end are2. But where are the horizontal lines in example0? In column4 and7, which are vertical.\n\nI think I'm out of time. I'll make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn the test input:\n\n- The vertical line in column3 (rows1-3): each cell is replaced with1.\n\n- The horizontal line in row5 (columns4-9): replaced with4s except the last cell (column9) which is2.\n\n- The horizontal line in row8 (columns0-4): replaced with4s except the last cell (column4) which is2.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nFor rows1-3, column3: 1s.\n\nRow5, columns4-9: 4s except column9 which is2.\n\nRow8, columns0-4: 4s except column4 which is2.\n\nOther 5s:\n\nRow8, columns0-4: the input has 5s, so replaced with4s except column4 as2.\n\nLet me write the test output accordingly.",
