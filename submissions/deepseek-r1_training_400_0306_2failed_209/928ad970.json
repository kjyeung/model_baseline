        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices in the training examples and then apply that pattern to the test input. Let me start by looking at the training examples closely.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input has a structure with 5s and 1s arranged in a cross-like shape. The output seems to add layers around the original 1s. The original 1s are in the middle rows forming a sort of square. The output adds a border of 1s around them, creating a larger rectangle with a hollow center. Also, the 5s in the input are retained in the same positions in the output. So maybe the pattern is to create a frame around existing non-zero elements, using the same number as the existing structure?\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the middle has a cross of 1s. The output has a bigger rectangle of 1s surrounding that cross, but with a hollow inside. For example, the input's row 4 is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0], and in the output, rows 2 and 10 are filled with 1s except the edges. It looks like the output is creating a border around the original structure, expanding it by one layer each way, but keeping the original numbers (like 5s) in place.\n\nExample 1 has 3s in the input. The output adds a frame of 3s around the existing 3s. The 5s are again kept in their positions. Similarly, in Example 2, the input has 4s arranged in a square, and the output adds a larger frame of 4s around them. The 5s are still present where they were in the input.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each non-zero number (like 1, 3, 4) that forms a contiguous block, add a border around it, creating a larger rectangle or frame of the same number. The 5s are left as is, perhaps acting as markers that don't change. The frames added are like expanding the existing structure outward by one layer, making sure that the new frame is a solid border except where there are 5s or other existing structures.\n\nWait, but how exactly is the frame constructed? Let's take Example 0's input. The original 1s form a cross. The output creates a rectangle that encloses this cross. The frame is a layer of 1s around the cross, making a bigger rectangle, but with the inside hollowed out. So the transformation is creating a border around the existing non-zero (non-5) elements, turning them into a hollow rectangle (or frame) of the same number.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input has a 4x4 square (maybe 4s forming a square with a hollow center?), and the output adds another layer around it. Wait, the input for Example 2's 4s is:\n\nRows 5-8 in the input:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo that's a square of 4s with a hollow center. The output in Example 2 adds a larger frame around this, making a bigger rectangle of 4s. The new frame is a solid layer around the original square. The 5s remain in their positions.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each contiguous block of a number (other than 5), create a frame (a hollow rectangle) around that block, expanding it by one unit in all directions. The original numbers (except 5s) are replaced by this frame. Wait, but in the outputs, the original non-5 numbers are replaced by the frame. Or maybe the existing structure is expanded by adding a frame around it, but keeping the original structure. Wait, no. In Example 0, the original 1s are part of the cross, and the output has a larger structure. Let me check:\n\nInput Example 0's 1s are in rows 4-7:\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 6: [0,5,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,5,0]\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe output has a bigger rectangle of 1s around this. The output's rows 2-10 have 1s forming a frame. So the original cross is now inside a bigger hollow rectangle. It's as if the cross is the center, and the frame is added around it, but the cross's structure is still present. Wait, but in the output, the original cross's 1s are still there, but surrounded by the new frame. So maybe the transformation is to add a border around each contiguous block of a certain number (excluding 5), turning it into a hollow rectangle (with the same number) that surrounds the original block. The 5s are left as is.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Identify all regions of numbers that are not 5. For each such region (contiguous block of the same number), create a frame around it. The frame is a hollow rectangle of the same number, expanding the original region by one unit in all directions where possible.\n\nBut how to determine the boundaries of the frame. For example, in Example 0, the original cross is in rows 4-7 and columns 5-7 (assuming 0-based indexing). The output frame is from rows 2-10 and columns 2-10 (approx), forming a larger rectangle. Wait, but looking at the output of Example 0:\n\nThe output's rows 2 and 10 are filled with 1s except the first two and last two elements. Then rows 3 and 9 are 1s at the ends and 0s in between. Wait, maybe I need to re-examine.\n\nWait, the output of Example 0's first row is all zeros. The second row is [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which matches the input. Then rows 2 and 10 have 1s forming a horizontal line. Rows 3-9 have 1s on the edges and then the original cross structure. Wait, maybe the transformation is to create a frame around each contiguous block, but each frame is a hollow rectangle. For example, the original cross (1s) is surrounded by a hollow rectangle of 1s. The original cross is still present, but now inside a larger rectangle. So the frame is added around the original shape, creating a hollow area between the original and the frame.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original structure is replaced by a frame. But in the output, the original 1s are still present. For example, in Example 0's output row 4: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Wait, the original 1s are in positions 5-7 (middle). The output row has 1s at position 2, then 0s, then the original 1s, then 0s, then another 1. So the frame is added around the entire structure, but the original structure remains. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to create a frame around each \"cluster\" of a number (not 5), where the frame is a rectangle that tightly encloses the cluster and is filled with that number, but with the interior set to 0 (or whatever the input's original values are). Wait, but in Example 0's output, the frame is a hollow rectangle. So the perimeter is filled with 1s, but the inside is the original cross. Wait, maybe the frame is added around the entire cluster, expanding it by one layer in all directions, and the new frame is a solid border. But in Example 0's output, the frame is a hollow rectangle with 1s on the border and the original cross inside. Wait, the frame is a larger rectangle that encloses the original cross, with the border made of 1s and the inside being the original cross. But how is that possible?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a border around the entire grid where clusters are present, but that doesn't fit. Let's think of each cluster of a number (other than 5) as a shape. For each such shape, create a frame around it. The frame's size is determined by the maximum and minimum rows and columns of the cluster, then expanded by one in each direction. The frame is then filled with the same number, but only on the perimeter, creating a hollow rectangle.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's cross cluster:\n\nThe cross spans rows 4-7 (assuming 0-based) and columns 5-7. The minimum row is 4, max row 7. Min column 5, max column 7. The frame would be from row 3 to row 8 (expanding by one each way) and columns 4 to 8. Then, the perimeter of this rectangle is filled with 1s, creating a hollow frame. The original cross remains inside. The 5s are left as is.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the 1s start at row 2 and go to row 10. Hmm, maybe my indexing is off. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 5s are in row 1 (second row) at position 4, row 6 (seventh row) at positions 1 and 11. The output's 5s are in the same positions. The 1s in the output start from row 2 (third row) and column 2 (third column), forming a frame around the original cross. So the original cross's position is in rows 4-7, columns 5-7. The frame in the output is rows 2-10, columns 2-10. Wait, that's a much larger expansion. That doesn't fit with expanding by one. Maybe there's a different logic here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frame is added around the entire grid, but that's not the case. The frames in the examples are localized around the clusters. For instance, in Example 1, the input has a cluster of 3s in rows 5-7 (assuming 0-based) and columns 4-6. The output's frame for the 3s starts at row 2, columns 2, and spans more rows and columns. Wait, maybe the frame is added such that it's two layers thick? Or perhaps the pattern is that for each cluster of a number (non-5), you create a frame around it by surrounding it with a rectangle of that number, where the rectangle's borders are one cell thick, and the rectangle's size is the bounding box of the original cluster expanded by one cell on each side.\n\nWait, let's take Example 0's cross cluster. The original cross's bounding box would be rows 4-7 (inclusive), columns 5-7. Expanding by one on each side would make rows 3-8 and columns 4-8. But in the output, the frame is much larger. So perhaps that approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output for Example 0, the 1s form a larger cross. Wait, no. The output for Example 0's rows 2 and 10 are filled with 1s except the first two and last two elements. Rows 3 and 9 have 1s at the edges and 0s inside. Then rows 4-8 have 1s on the edges and the original cross structure inside. So it's more like a big rectangle with 1s on the borders and the original cross inside. Wait, but the original cross is in the center of this larger rectangle. So maybe the frame is a rectangle that is centered around the original cluster and expands in all directions to form a border.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to create a frame that is a certain distance away from the original cluster, but that doesn't fit. Let me think of the structure in the output. For Example 0, the output's 1s form a hollow rectangle that encompasses the original cross and adds a border around it. The original cross is inside this rectangle, but the rectangle's borders are made of 1s. The hollow part is where the original cross is. So the transformation is to create a hollow rectangle (frame) around the original cluster, with the same number, and the original cluster remains inside.\n\nBut how is the size of the frame determined? For Example 0's cross, the original cluster is in rows 4-7 and columns 5-7. The frame in the output starts at row 2 and column 2, extending to row 10 and column 10. That's a significant expansion. Wait, the output's rows are 0-11 (since there are 12 rows). So the frame spans from row 2 to row 10 (inclusive), which is 9 rows. The columns are from 2 to 10 (inclusive), which is 9 columns. So the frame is a 9x9 square. The original cross is in the center of this square.\n\nHmm, maybe the frame is centered around the original cluster and is as large as possible, but that seems too vague. Alternatively, perhaps the frame is formed by expanding the original cluster's bounding box by a certain number of cells. But in Example 0, the original cross's bounding box is rows 4-7 (4 rows) and columns 5-7 (3 columns). The frame's bounding box is rows 2-10 (9 rows) and columns 2-10 (9 columns). The difference is expansion by 2 rows up and down, and 2 columns left and right. Wait, 4-7 is 4 rows. 2-10 is 9 rows. The original cluster's min row is 4, so 4 - 2 = 2 as the new min. Max row 7 + 3 = 10. So expansion by 2 rows up and 3 rows down? That doesn't seem consistent. Maybe it's expanding the bounding box to the edges of the grid, but that's not possible for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frame is added in a way that the original cluster is centered within the frame, and the frame's size is determined by the size of the grid. But the examples have different grid sizes. Example 0's input is 12 rows, 13 columns. The output for Example 0 has the same dimensions as the input, so the frame must fit within the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the frame is a rectangle that starts two rows above and below the original cluster's bounding box, and two columns left and right. But I'm not sure. Let's look at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the cluster of 3s is in rows 5-7, columns 4-6. The output's frame for the 3s starts at row 2, column 2, and spans to row 10, column 9. The original cluster is in the middle. The frame is a hollow rectangle of 3s surrounding the original cluster. So again, it's a larger frame than just expanding by one cell.\n\nWait, maybe the frame is added such that it creates a border around the entire grid, but only around the clusters. That doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the frame is always two cells thick around the original cluster. But in Example 0, the frame's vertical borders are two cells thick (rows 2 and 10 are filled with 1s, rows 3 and 9 have 1s only at the ends). Wait, no. Let me check Example 0's output again.\n\nExample 0's output rows:\n\nRow 2: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0] \u2192 full of 1s except the first two and last two.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0] \u2192 1s at the start and end.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0] \u2192 1s at the start and end, and original cross.\n\nSo the frame has an outer layer (row 2 and 10) filled with 1s, and the inner rows (3-9) have 1s only at the edges. So it's a hollow rectangle where the top and bottom rows are filled, and the middle rows have 1s only on the sides. So the frame is two rows thick vertically (rows 2 and 10) but only one cell thick on the sides in the middle rows. Wait, no. The vertical part (left and right edges) of the frame are present in all rows from 2 to 10. For example, in row 3, positions 2 and 10 are 1. In row 4, positions 2 and 10 are 1. So the left and right borders of the frame are columns 2 and 10. The top and bottom borders are rows 2 and 10. So the frame is a rectangle from row 2 to 10 and column 2 to 10. The top and bottom edges of this rectangle are filled with 1s (rows 2 and 10), and the left and right edges (columns 2 and 10) are filled with 1s in all rows between 2 and 10. The interior of this rectangle (rows 3-9, columns 3-9) is the original structure.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So the frame is a rectangle that encloses the original cluster, expanding it to a larger rectangle where the borders are filled with the same number, and the interior is the original cluster. Wait, but in the output, the original cluster is inside the frame, but how? For example, in Example 0, the original cluster of 1s is inside the frame's area. So the frame's rectangle is created around the original cluster, and the original cluster is placed within this frame's interior. However, the frame's borders are added, and the interior of the frame (the area within the borders) is where the original cluster is placed. So the transformation is: for each cluster of a number (non-5), create a frame (a hollow rectangle) of that number, and place the original cluster inside this frame. The 5s are left unchanged.\n\nBut how is the size of the frame determined? In Example 0, the original cluster's position is such that the frame's borders are at columns 2 and 10, rows 2 and 10. So the frame is created by adding a border two columns to the left and right of the original cluster, and two rows above and below. Wait, perhaps the frame is added at a fixed distance from the cluster's edges. But that would require knowing how much to expand. Alternatively, maybe the frame is created by expanding the cluster's bounding box by a certain amount in all directions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the frame is created such that it's as large as possible given the grid's dimensions, but that doesn't fit. Let's look at Example 2's input and output. The input's cluster of 4s is in rows 5-8 and columns 4-7. The output's frame for the 4s starts at row 3, column 2, and spans to row 12, column 11. Wait, the output for Example 2 has rows 3 and 12 as part of the frame. The original cluster is in rows 5-8. The frame's rows start at 3 and end at 12. So that's adding two rows above and four rows below the original cluster. This seems inconsistent with the previous example.\n\nThis suggests that the frame's expansion isn't a fixed number of cells. Perhaps there's another pattern. Let's think differently. Looking at the outputs, the frame seems to be a hollow rectangle of the same number as the cluster, which is added such that it surrounds the original cluster. The 5s are left in their original positions. So maybe the transformation is: for each cluster of a number (non-5), create a hollow rectangle (frame) around the cluster. The rectangle's dimensions are such that it is the smallest possible to enclose the cluster with a border of one cell thickness. Wait, but in Example 0, the original cluster's bounding box is rows 4-7 and columns 5-7. The frame's bounding box is rows 2-10 and columns 2-10, which is much larger than a one-cell expansion. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frame is created by expanding the cluster's bounding box to the edges of the grid. But in Example 0, the grid has 12 rows. The frame goes from row 2 to 10 (0-based), which is 9 rows. The original cluster is in rows 4-7. Expanding to row 2 and 10 would be adding two rows above and three rows below. That doesn't seem systematic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the frame is created by adding a certain number of layers around the cluster. For example, in Example 0, the frame has a certain width around the cluster. But it's unclear how to determine the number of layers.\n\nAnother approach: look for the position of 5s in the input and output. In all examples, the 5s are present in the same positions in both input and output. So the 5s are preserved, and other numbers are transformed. The clusters of non-5 numbers are surrounded by frames of the same number.\n\nSo, the transformation steps could be:\n\n1. Identify all clusters of non-5 numbers. A cluster is a contiguous block of the same number (connected vertically or horizontally).\n\n2. For each such cluster, create a hollow rectangular frame of the same number around it. The frame is placed such that the original cluster is inside the frame.\n\n3. The frame's size is such that it is the maximum possible to fit within the grid, or perhaps it's a fixed expansion.\n\nBut how to determine the frame's size. Let's think about the output of Example 0. The frame for the 1s is a rectangle spanning rows 2-10 and columns 2-10. The original cluster is in the middle. The frame's top and bottom are rows 2 and 10, which are filled with 1s. The left and right edges are columns 2 and 10, which have 1s in all rows between 2 and 10. The interior of this rectangle (rows 3-9, columns 3-9) is where the original cluster is placed. Wait, but in the output, the original cluster is in rows 4-7 and columns 5-7, which is within the frame's interior. So the frame is a larger rectangle that contains the original cluster, and the frame's borders are filled with the same number as the cluster.\n\nSo perhaps the frame is created by expanding the cluster's bounding box to the maximum possible given the grid's dimensions, but that doesn't explain the exact expansion. Alternatively, the frame could be created by expanding the cluster's bounding box by a fixed amount. For example, adding two rows above and below, two columns left and right. But in Example 0's input, the cluster's min row is 4. Adding two rows above would take it to row 2 (4-2=2), and two rows below would take it to row 7+2=9, but the output's frame goes up to row 10. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frame is created by expanding the cluster's bounding box to the nearest edge of the grid. For example, in Example 0, the cluster is in the middle. The frame expands to cover from row 2 to 10, column 2 to 10. Maybe this is the maximum possible expansion given the grid's size. But the grid has 12 rows. The frame covers rows 2-10 (9 rows), which is centered around the original cluster. Similarly, columns 2-10 (9 columns), centered.\n\nBut how is the expansion determined? Maybe the frame is added such that it is centered around the original cluster and takes up as much space as possible, but leaving at least two rows/columns at the edges. But this is speculative.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the frames are added symmetrically around the original cluster. For example, in Example 0's output, the frame is symmetric around the original cross. So perhaps the frame is created by expanding the cluster's bounding box equally in all directions as much as possible, but keeping symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, the frame could be a fixed size larger than the original cluster. But without seeing more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nLet's try to see if there's a common pattern in the frame's dimensions across examples.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the original cluster of 1s has a bounding box of rows 4-7 (4 rows) and columns 5-7 (3 columns). The frame's bounding box is rows 2-10 (9 rows) and columns 2-10 (9 columns). The difference in rows: original cluster spans 4 rows, frame spans 9 rows. Original cluster starts at row 4. Frame starts at row 2. So expansion is 2 rows up and 3 rows down. Similarly, columns: original starts at column 5. Frame starts at column 2. Expansion is 3 columns left and 3 columns right.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the original 3s are in rows 5-7 (3 rows) and columns 4-6 (3 columns). The frame's rows are 2-10 (9 rows), columns 2-9 (8 columns). The expansion is 3 rows up (5-2=3) and 3 rows down (10-7=3). Columns: 4-6, expanded to 2-9. So 2 columns left (4-2=2) and 3 right (9-6=3). Hmm, this isn't consistent with Example 0.\n\nExample 2's input cluster of 4s is in rows 5-8 (4 rows) and columns 4-7 (4 columns). The frame's rows are 3-12 (10 rows) and columns 2-11 (10 columns). So expansion is 2 rows up (5-3=2) and 4 rows down (12-8=4). Columns: 4-7, expanded to 2-11: 2 left (4-2=2) and 4 right (11-7=4). Again, the expansion is not consistent across examples.\n\nSo perhaps the expansion isn't based on a fixed number of rows/columns but rather some other rule. Maybe the frame is created by expanding the original cluster's bounding box to the maximum possible given the grid's dimensions, but ensuring that the frame's borders are at least two rows/columns away from the cluster's edges. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frame is created such that the original cluster is centered within the frame. For Example 0's original cluster's center would be at row (4+7)/2 = 5.5, column (5+7)/2=6. The frame's center is at row (2+10)/2=6, column (2+10)/2=6. So centered. Similarly, Example 1's original cluster center is row (5+7)/2=6, column (4+6)/2=5. The frame's center is row (2+10)/2=6, column (2+9)/2=5.5. Close to centered. So maybe the frame is centered on the original cluster, and as large as possible to fit within the grid.\n\nBut how to determine the size. For Example 0's frame, the rows go from 2 to 10 (total 9 rows). The original cluster's center is at row 5.5, and the frame's center is row 6. So the frame extends 4 rows up and 4 rows down from the center. But 6 - 2 = 4, 10 -6=4. Similarly, columns 2-10: centered at 6. So 6 -2=4, 10-6=4. So the frame is a square of size 9x9, centered on the original cluster's center, extending 4 cells in all directions. This would require that the grid has enough space. For example, if the original cluster is near the edge, the frame can't extend as much.\n\nLooking at Example 0's grid has 12 rows. The frame's rows are 2-10, which is 9 rows. If the center is row 6, then extending 4 rows up and down would go from 2 to 10. That fits. Similarly for columns.\n\nExample 1's frame is rows 2-10 (9 rows), columns 2-9 (8 columns). The original cluster's center is row 6, column 5. The frame's rows are centered at row 6 (2-10), which matches. Columns: 2-9 is 8 columns, centered at (2+9)/2 = 5.5. The original cluster's column center is 5, so the frame is centered around 5.5, which is close. The frame's columns extend from 2 to 9 (8 columns), so 3.5 cells left and 3.5 cells right from the center. But since columns are integers, maybe it's asymmetric.\n\nExample 2's frame is rows 3-12 (10 rows), columns 2-11 (10 columns). The original cluster's center is row (5+8)/2=6.5, column (4+7)/2=5.5. The frame's center is row (3+12)/2=7.5, column (2+11)/2=6.5. Not exactly centered. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nMaybe the frame is created by expanding the original cluster's bounding box to the maximum possible in all directions, but leaving a certain margin. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the frame could be a fixed size of 9x9 (as in Example 0), but Example 1's frame is 9x8, and Example 2's is 10x10. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frame is created such that it's the largest possible square that can fit around the cluster, given the grid's size. But that also doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother approach: in the output, the frame's borders are at certain positions. For Example 0, the frame starts at row 2 and column 2. The 5 in row 1 is at column 4. The frame starts at column 2, which is two columns to the left of the 5. Similarly, in Example 1, the frame starts at row 2 and column 2, but the 5s are in different positions. So maybe the frame's position is not directly related to the 5s but is determined by the cluster's position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frame is always placed two rows above the top-most 5 in the input and two rows below, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, perhaps I should try to deduce the rule based on the examples. Let's think of each cluster of non-5 numbers. The output adds a frame around each such cluster. The frame is a hollow rectangle made of the same number as the cluster. The 5s remain in their original positions. The frame's dimensions are such that it's a certain expansion of the cluster's bounding box.\n\nBut in the examples, the frames seem to be added in such a way that they form a larger rectangle around the cluster, but the exact expansion varies. For instance, in Example 0's output, the frame is a hollow rectangle around the original cross, with the cross inside. The frame's borders are filled with 1s. The same applies to Example 1 and 2.\n\nAnother observation: the frame in the output seems to be two layers thick. For example, in Example 0, row 2 and row 10 are filled with 1s, and columns 2 and 10 are filled with 1s in each row between 2 and 10. So the frame is a rectangle with outer borders at row 2 and 10, column 2 and 10, and the inner area (rows 3-9, columns 3-9) contains the original cluster. So the frame is one cell thick on the borders. Wait, no: row 2 is all 1s (except the first two and last two), which are part of the frame's top and bottom. The left and right borders are columns 2 and 10, which are filled with 1s from row 2 to row 10. So the frame is a hollow rectangle where the top and bottom are rows 2 and 10, and the left and right are columns 2 and 10. The interior of this rectangle is from row 3 to 9 and column 3 to 9. The original cluster is placed inside this interior area.\n\nSo the frame's size is determined by adding a certain number of rows and columns around the cluster's bounding box. For example, in Example 0's original cluster, the frame's rectangle starts two rows above the cluster's top row and two rows below the cluster's bottom row. Similarly, two columns to the left and right of the cluster's leftmost and rightmost columns. But in Example 0, the original cluster's top row is 4, so frame's top row is 4-2=2. Bottom row is 7+3=10. Left column is 5-3=2. Right column is7+3=10. Wait, 5-3=2, 7+3=10. That adds three columns on the left and three on the right, but the numbers don't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frame's borders are two rows and columns away from the cluster's bounding box. For example, in Example 0, the cluster's top row is 4. The frame's top row is 4-2=2. Cluster's bottom row is 7. Frame's bottom row is 7+3=10. That's inconsistent. This approach isn't yielding a clear pattern.\n\nMaybe I need to focus on the test input and see what the expected output would be based on the examples.\n\nThe test input has clusters of 8s and 5s. Let's see:\n\nTest input:\n\nRows (0-based):\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,5,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nRow 13: [0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the clusters of non-5 numbers are:\n\n- The 8s in rows 5-7, columns 5-8 (since row 5 has 8s in columns 5-8, row 6 has 8s at 5 and 8, row 7 has 8s in 5-8. So it's a rectangle with a hollow center.\n\nThere's also a 5 in row 6, column 2, and row 9, column 12, row 13, column 5.\n\nFollowing the pattern from the examples, each cluster of non-5 numbers (here, the 8s) should be surrounded by a hollow frame of 8s. The 5s remain in their positions.\n\nSo the expected output would have a frame of 8s around the original 8 cluster, and any other clusters would also have frames. But in the test input, there's only one cluster of non-5 numbers: the 8s.\n\nSo for the 8s cluster, the output should have a frame of 8s around it, leaving the 5s in place.\n\nIn the training examples, the frame's position is such that it surrounds the cluster and expands outward. For the test input's 8s cluster, which is in rows 5-7, columns 5-8.\n\nFollowing the pattern, the frame would be a hollow rectangle of 8s around this cluster. Let's assume that the frame is created by expanding the cluster's bounding box by a certain amount. For example, the original cluster's rows are 5-7 (3 rows), columns 5-8 (4 columns). The frame would need to be placed around this.\n\nLooking at Example 0's cluster of 1s (rows 4-7, columns 5-7), the frame was rows 2-10, columns 2-10. So expanding from 4 rows to 9 rows (adding 5 rows) and 3 columns to 9 columns (adding 6 columns). But that doesn't seem to be a consistent pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frame is placed such that it's two rows above and below the cluster and two columns to the left and right. For the test input's 8s cluster:\n\nCluster rows: 5-7. Adding two rows above and below would make the frame rows 3-9.\n\nCluster columns: 5-8. Adding two columns left and right would make columns 3-10.\n\nBut the test input has 15 columns (0-14). So columns 3-10 are within bounds.\n\nSo the frame would be a hollow rectangle from row 3 to row 9, column 3 to 10. The top and bottom rows (3 and 9) would be filled with 8s. The left and right columns (3 and 10) would be filled with 8s in all rows from 3 to 9. The interior of this rectangle (rows 4-8, columns 4-9) would contain the original cluster of 8s.\n\nBut in the test input's original cluster is in rows 5-7, columns 5-8. So within the frame's interior, the original cluster would be centered. The original cluster's rows are 5-7, which are within the frame's rows 3-9. The columns are 5-8, within the frame's columns 3-10.\n\nAdditionally, any existing 5s in the frame's area would remain. For example, in row 6, column 2 is a 5. The frame's left column is 3, so the 5 is outside the frame and remains unchanged. The 5 in row 9, column 12 is outside the frame's columns (3-10). The 5 in row 13, column 5 is also outside the frame's rows (3-9).\n\nSo the expected output would have:\n\n- The frame of 8s around the original 8s cluster.\n\n- The 5s in their original positions.\n\n- Other cells remain 0.\n\nLet's try to construct this frame.\n\nRows 3 and 9 (0-based) would be filled with 8s except for the first three and last three columns (assuming the frame's columns are 3-10). Wait, no. In Example 0's output, the top and bottom rows of the frame (rows 2 and 10) are filled with 1s except the first two and last two columns. So for the test input's frame, rows 3 and 9 would have 8s from column 3 to 10.\n\nThen, for the columns 3 and 10 in rows 4-8, those positions would be 8s. The interior of the frame (columns 4-9, rows 4-8) would have the original 8s cluster.\n\nWait, but the original 8s cluster is in rows 5-7, columns 5-8. So within the frame's interior (rows 4-8, columns 4-9), the original cluster would be placed. The frame's interior would have 0s except where the original cluster is.\n\nBut the original cluster has 8s in rows 5-7, columns 5-8. So the output's rows 5-7 would still have the 8s as in the input, but surrounded by the frame.\n\nWait, the output would have:\n\n- Rows 3 and 9: filled with 8s from columns 3 to 10.\n\n- Columns 3 and 10 in rows 4-8: filled with 8s.\n\n- The interior (rows 4-8, columns 4-9) would have the original cluster's 8s. So rows 5-7, columns 5-8: 8s as per input, and other parts of the interior would be 0.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the original cross of 1s is surrounded by the frame. The frame's interior has the original cross plus possibly other 1s. Wait, no. In Example 0's output row 4: [0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0]. So the 1s are at column 2 (frame's left border), then 0s until column 5, which is part of the original cross. So the frame's left border is column 2, and the original cross starts at column 5. So the interior of the frame (columns 3-10) has the original cross. This suggests that the frame's interior is filled with 0s except for the original cluster.\n\nSo applying this to the test input's 8s cluster:\n\n- The frame would be a hollow rectangle of 8s around the cluster.\n\n- The frame's top and bottom rows are filled with 8s in their respective columns.\n\n- The frame's left and right columns are filled with 8s in all rows between top and bottom.\n\n- The interior of the frame (everything inside the borders) has the original cluster's 8s and 0s elsewhere.\n\nSo for the test input's 8s cluster, the frame's top row (row 3) would be [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]. Similarly, row 9 would have the same. The left column (column 3) would have 8s in rows 3-9. The right column (column 10) would have 8s in rows 3-9. The interior would be rows 4-8 and columns 4-9. In this area, the original cluster's 8s are present as per the input, and other cells are 0.\n\nAdditionally, the 5s in the input are preserved. For example, row 6, column 2 has a 5. The frame's left column is column 3, so this 5 is outside the frame and remains. The 5 in row 9, column 12 is outside the frame's columns (3-10). The 5 in row 13, column 5 is outside the frame's rows (3-9).\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\nRows 3 and 9 filled with 8s in columns 3-10.\n\nColumns 3 and 10 filled with 8s in rows 3-9.\n\nInterior (rows 4-8, columns 4-9) contains the original cluster:\n\n- Rows 5-7, columns 5-8 have the original 8s as per input.\n\n- For example, row 5 (input's row 5) was [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. In the output's row 5, columns 4-9 would be:\n\n[8 (col3), 0 (col4), 0 (col5), 8,8,8,8 (cols5-8), 0 (col9), 8 (col10)].\n\nWait, no. Wait, the frame's columns are 3 and 10. The interior is columns 4-9 and rows 4-8.\n\nIn row 5 of the output (which is input's row 5), the original 8s are in columns 5-8. So the output's row 5 would be:\n\ncolumns 3: 8 (left border)\n\ncolumns 4-9: 0 except for columns 5-8 which are 8s.\n\ncolumn 10: 8 (right border)\n\nSo the row would be: [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut in the frame's top and bottom rows (3 and 9), all columns from 3 to 10 are 8s. For example, row 3:\n\n[0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0].\n\nRows 4-8:\n\nEach row has 8s at columns 3 and 10. Between columns 4-9, only the original cluster's 8s are present.\n\nFor example, row 6 of the input has [0,0,5,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. In the output's row 6:\n\n- column 3: 8\n\n- columns 4-9: 0 except for columns 5 and 8 (from the original cluster), but in the input row 6, columns 5 and 8 are 8.\n\nWait, the input row 6's cluster has 8s at columns 5 and 8. So in the output's row 6, columns 4-9 would have 8s only at 5 and 8. But the frame's interior is columns 4-9. So row 6's output would be:\n\n[0,0,5,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0].\n\nWait, but the original 5 is in column 2, so it's outside the frame and remains.\n\nPutting this all together, the output should have a frame of 8s around the original 8s cluster, preserving the 5s.\n\nSo the test input's output would look like:\n\nRows 0-2: mostly zeros, except any 5s (none in these rows).\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,5,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow 10 and above: zeros except any 5s.\n\nBut wait, row 9 in the input has a 5 in column 12. In the output's row 9, which is part of the frame's bottom row (row 9), the 5 is in column 12, which is outside the frame's columns (3-10). So row 9's output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,5,0]\n\nSimilarly, row 13's 5 in column 5 is outside the frame's rows (3-9), so it remains.\n\nSo the final output should have a frame of 8s as described, with the 5s in their original positions.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by looking at the examples provided to understand what's going on.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the input has a structure with 5s and 1s arranged in a sort of diamond shape. The output seems to create a border around the original structure. The 5s remain in the same positions, but there's a new layer of 1s forming a frame around them. For instance, in the output, rows 2 and 10 have a series of 1s surrounding the original elements. The inner parts have a border of 1s, and the 5s are preserved. It looks like the transformation adds a frame of a certain number (which seems to be the number present in the original structure's blocks) around the existing elements, creating a sort of box or border.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 5s and 3s. The output again shows the 5s staying in place, and the 3s are now forming a larger border around the original 3x3 square. The new border is made up of 3s. Similarly, in Example 2, the input has 4s and 5s, and the output adds a border of 4s around the original 4s structure. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each block of a certain number (like 1, 3, 4 in the examples), the transformation adds a border of that number around it. Additionally, the 5s are left untouched and serve as markers that aren't part of the border. The border is created by surrounding the original blocks with the same number, expanding outward in all directions to form a frame. The borders are also hollow in the middle, creating a kind of outline.\n\nNow, looking at the test input. The input has 5s and a block of 8s. Following the pattern, the 5s should remain in their positions, and the 8s should have a border added around them. The original 8s form a horizontal line of four 8s in rows 5, 6, and 7. Let me check the positions. The 8s are in row 5, columns 5-8 (indices 5,6,7,8?), then row 6 has 8s at columns 5 and 8, and row 7 again columns 5-8. Wait, the input for the test is:\n\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, ...]\nRow 6: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, ...]\nRow 7: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, ...]\n\nSo the 8s form a sort of square or rectangle. The original 8s are in a 3-row structure. The border should be added around this entire block. The number used for the border would be 8, as that's the number in the original block. The 5s are left as they are, except those that are part of the border's path would be overwritten? Or perhaps the 5s are preserved regardless. From the training examples, the 5s were kept even when the new border passed through their positions. For instance, in Example 0, the 5 in row 6, column 1 is present in the output, and the new 1s are around it. So the 5s are not overwritten. So the border is added around the original blocks, but 5s are kept in their original positions, possibly overlapping with the border if they are in the way.\n\nSo for the test input, the 8s should get a border of 8s around them. Let's imagine the original 8s are in a rectangle from row 5 to 7, columns 5 to 8. The border would expand outward by one cell in all directions. So the border would start at row 4, columns 4-9, forming a larger rectangle. But also, the border would need to be hollow. Wait, in the training examples, the borders are hollow, like in Example 0, the output rows 2 and 10 are all 1s, but the inner rows have 1s on the edges and 0s inside. So the border is a frame, one cell thick.\n\nSo applying this to the test input's 8s block: the original 8s are in rows 5-7, columns 5-8. The border would be added around them. So the new rows would be 4-8 (since original starts at row 5, expand up and down by one), and columns 4-9 (original starts at column 5, expand left and right by one). The border would be a frame of 8s around the original block. However, the existing 8s would remain, and the new border would be added around them. Also, any 5s in the path of the new border would remain, as per the training examples.\n\nLooking at the test input, there's a 5 in row 6, column 2 (0-based or 1-based? Let me check the indices. The input is given as lists; in programming terms, they are 0-based. Wait, in Example 0, the input has a 5 at row 1 (second row) column 4 (fifth element), and in the output, that 5 remains. Similarly, in Example 1, the 5 in row 5, column 1 (input) is present in the output. So the 5s are preserved even if the new border overlaps their positions. So in the test input, the 5 in row 1 (second line) column 7 (eighth position) and the 5 in row 13 (fourteenth line) column 5 (sixth position) should remain, and the 8 border would go around the 8s block, possibly overlapping other 5s? Wait, the test input also has a 5 in row 6 (seventh line), column 2 (third position). Let's see:\n\nIn the test input:\n\nRow 1 (index 1): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, ...]\nRow 6 (index 6): [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, ...]\nRow 9 (index 9): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\nRow 13 (index 13): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, ...]\n\nThese 5s should remain in their positions. Now, the 8s block is in rows 5-7 (indices 5,6,7) and columns 5-8 (indices 5,6,7,8). So expanding the border would create a frame around this block, adding a layer of 8s. The top of the border would be row 4, columns 4-9 (since original starts at column 5, so left by one column, and original ends at column 8, so right by one column). The bottom of the border would be row 8. The left and right borders would be columns 4 and 9. Then, the vertical borders would be columns 4 and 9 from row 4 to row 8. The top and bottom borders would be rows 4 and 8, from column 4 to 9. But since the original block is three rows high (rows 5-7), adding a layer around would make the border from row 4 to 8 (inclusive). Wait, original starts at row 5, so top border would be row 4, bottom border row 8. Similarly, original columns start at 5, left border at 4, right border at 9. \n\nBut also, the border should be hollow. So the inside of the border (rows 5-7, columns 5-8) would remain as they are, and the border is the perimeter around them. Wait, no: the original 8s are in rows 5-7, columns 5-8. The border is added around that, so the new border would be a rectangle from row 4 to 8 and column 4 to 9. The perimeter of this rectangle would be filled with 8s, except for the original area, which is already filled. But since the original area may have 8s, perhaps the border is a new layer outside. For example, in Example 0, the original 1s are in rows 4-7 (indices 4-7) for the vertical part. The output adds a border around that, creating a larger rectangle. Similarly, in the test case, adding a border around the 8s would create a new frame of 8s around the existing ones.\n\nSo the steps are: identify all contiguous blocks of numbers (excluding 5s) and draw a border around each such block with the same number. The 5s are left as is. But in the training examples, there was only one such block per input. For example, Example 0 had a single 1 block, Example 1 had a 3 block, Example 2 had a 4 block. The test input has a single 8 block. So perhaps the rule is that each contiguous block (excluding 5s) gets a border of its own number. But the 5s are preserved, even if they are in the path of the border.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. The 8s are in a block. Let's outline the border:\n\nThe original 8s are in rows 5-7 (indices 5,6,7) and columns 5-8 (indices 5,6,7,8). The border will be a rectangle around this, so rows 4-8 and columns 4-9. The top border is row 4, columns 4-9. The bottom border is row 8, columns 4-9. The left border is column 4, rows 4-8. The right border is column 9, rows 4-8. The corners are part of the border. However, the existing 5s in these positions need to be checked. For example, in row 6 (index 6), column 2 (index 2) is a 5, which is outside the border area (since the border starts at column 4). The 5 in row 1, column 7 is also outside. The 5 in row 9, column 12 (index 12) is in a different part. The 5 in row 13, column 5 is also elsewhere. So the border would be added around the 8s, and any positions in the border that were 0 would become 8, but existing 5s or other numbers (there are none except 8 and 5 in the input) would remain. \n\nWait, the input has 8s and 5s. So when adding the border of 8s, any cell in the border area that was 0 would become 8. Any cell that was 5 would stay 5. So the 5 in row 6, column 2 is not in the border area. Let's check the coordinates:\n\nThe border area for the 8s is rows 4-8 and columns 4-9. So row 6, column 2 is outside of columns 4-9, so it's not affected. The 5 in row 1, column 7 (index 7) is in row 1, which is outside the border's rows (4-8). So that's safe. The 5 in row 9, column 12 is outside the columns 4-9, so that's also safe. The 5 in row 13, column 5 is in a different area. So the border can be added without conflicting with existing 5s.\n\nSo the output should have a border of 8s around the original 8s. Let's visualize:\n\nOriginal 8s block:\n\nRow 5: [0s..., 8,8,8,8, 0s...]\nRow 6: [0s...,8,0,0,8, 0s...]\nRow 7: [0s...,8,8,8,8, 0s...]\n\nBorder would add:\n\nRow 4: columns 4-9 as 8s\nRow 8: columns 4-9 as 8s\nColumns 4 and 9 for rows 4-8 as 8s.\n\nSo the output for these rows would be:\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0...]\nRow 5: [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0...] but wait, no. Wait, the original row 5 is columns 5-8. So the border would be row 4 (top) from column 4 to 9, all 8s. Then, rows 5-7 (original rows) would have 8s in columns 4 and 9. And row 8 (bottom border) would have columns 4-9 as 8s.\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the border is a frame. For instance, in Example 0's output, the 1s form a frame. Let me check how that was done. For example, in Example 0's output, the rows 2 and 10 are filled with 1s in the middle, creating a horizontal line. The vertical borders are in columns 2 and 10. So for the original 1s in rows 4-7, the border is added as a frame around them.\n\nSo applying that to the test case's 8s:\n\nThe original 8s are in a block that's 3 rows high (rows 5-7) and 4 columns wide (columns 5-8). The border would be added as a frame around this block. So:\n\n- The top border is row 4, columns 4 to 9 (since the original block's left is column 5, so border left is column 4; original right is column 8, so border right is column 9). So row 4, columns 4-9 are 8s.\n- The bottom border is row 8, columns 4-9.\n- The left border is column 4, rows 4-8.\n- The right border is column 9, rows 4-8.\n\nInside this frame (rows 5-7, columns 5-8) remain the original 8s and 0s. But wait, the original 8s are in rows 5-7 and columns 5-8. So the frame would be around this area.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's input, the 1s were in rows 4-7 and columns 5-7 (a diamond shape?), and the output added a frame around that, expanding to rows 2-10 and columns 2-10. Hmm, maybe I need to look more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the border is added such that each layer is added around the existing block, expanding by one cell in all directions. So for a block of cells, the border is the cells adjacent to the perimeter of the block, but not overlapping with the original block. Wait, but in the training examples, the original elements are still present. For instance, in Example 0, the original 1s are still there, and the border is added around them. So the border is a new layer outside the original block.\n\nSo for the test input, the original 8s are in rows 5-7, columns 5-8. The border would be added in the cells that are adjacent to this block. So:\n\nTop border: row 4, columns 4-9 (since the original block's top row is 5, so row 4 is the top border. The original block's leftmost column is 5, so left border starts at column 4 (to the left of 5). The rightmost original column is 8, so the right border is 9 (to the right of 8). The bottom border is row 8, columns 4-9.\n\nLeft and right borders: columns 4 and 9, from row 4 to row 8.\n\nSo the border would form a rectangle around the original block.\n\nBut how to determine the borders in the training examples. Let's check Example 0:\n\nInput has 1s in rows 4-7 (indices 4-7), columns 5-7. The output adds a border around them. The output's rows 2-10 and columns 2-10 are filled with 1s in the borders. So it's a larger rectangle. But perhaps the number of layers added depends on the original block's size. Wait, no. Example 0's output adds a single layer around the original 1s. The original block is a diamond shape, but the border is a square around it. So perhaps the border is added as a minimal rectangle encompassing the original block, then expanding outward by one cell in all directions.\n\nIn the test case, the original block is a rectangle. The minimal rectangle encompassing the original 8s is rows 5-7, columns 5-8. Adding a border around it would create a new rectangle from row 4-8 and columns 4-9. The border is one cell thick.\n\nSo, for each cell in the border (row 4, columns 4-9; row 8, columns 4-9; columns 4 and 9, rows 4-8), set them to 8, except where there's a 5. But in the test input's case, are there any 5s in the border area?\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow 4: all zeros except maybe not. Let me check the test input again.\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 6: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 7: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 8: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 9: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\nRows 10-14: all zeros except row 13 has a 5.\n\nSo the border area for the 8s is rows 4-8, columns 4-9. Let's check if any of these cells have 5s:\n\nRow 4: all zeros, so no 5s here.\nRow 5: columns 4 is 0, columns 5-8 are 8s.\nRow 6: column 4 is 0, column 5 is 8, column 9 is 0. But row 6, column 2 is 5, which is outside the columns 4-9.\nRow 7: columns 4 is 0, columns 5-8 are 8s.\nRow 8: all zeros in the original input, so columns 4-9 are 0.\n\nSo in the border area (rows 4-8, columns 4-9), there are no existing 5s. Therefore, all cells in the border area can be set to 8, except where there are existing 5s. But since there are no 5s there, the entire border becomes 8.\n\nSo the output should have:\n\n- Row 4: columns 4-9 set to 8.\n- Rows 5-7: columns 4 and 9 set to 8, other columns remain as per original (but the original 8s are present in columns 5-8).\n- Row 8: columns 4-9 set to 8.\n\nNow, let's construct the output rows:\n\nOriginal row 4 (all zeros) becomes:\n[0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOriginal row 5: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,...] becomes:\n[0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,...]\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original row 5 has 8s in columns 5-8. The border adds column 4 and 9 as 8s. So row 5 becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0 (column 3), 8 (column4), 8,8,8,8 (columns5-8), 8 (column9), 0, ...]\n\nSimilarly, row 6, which originally had 8s in columns 5 and 8, now has 8 in columns4 and9. So row6:\n\n[0,0,5,0,8 (column4), 8,0,0,8,8 (column9), ...]\n\nRow7: original 8s in columns5-8, border adds 8s in column4 and9.\n\nRow8: columns4-9 are 8s, so row8 becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,...]\n\nSo the final output would have these changes. Additionally, the other 5s in the input (rows1,6,9,13) remain in their positions.\n\nNow, checking the training examples, the output also has certain other patterns. For example, the borders are not just around the original block but also form a kind of frame that's hollow. For instance, in Example 0's output, the middle rows have 1s on the edges but 0s inside. So the border is a single-cell thick frame. Similarly, in the test case's output, the border added around the 8s should be a single-cell thick frame. Therefore, the inner part of the border (the original 8s' positions) remain as they are, and the border is added around them.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in Example 2, the input had a block of 4s and 5s, and the output added a border of 4s around the 4s. The 5s were preserved. So this pattern holds.\n\nPutting it all together, the test input's output should have a border of 8s around the original 8s block, with all 5s remaining in their original positions. The rest of the grid remains 0 except for the added 8s in the border.\n\nNow, let's write out the test output. The output should have the same number of rows as the input (15 rows) and each row has the same length as the input rows (15 elements).\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow0: all zeros. No changes.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] remains the same.\n\nRow2: all zeros. No changes.\n\nRow3: all zeros. No changes.\n\nRow4: columns4-9 (indices4 to9) set to 8. So:\n\n[0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: original is [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Now, set column4 and9 to8:\n\n[0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, wait. Original row5 has 8s in columns5-8 (indices5-8). Adding the left border (column4) and right border (column9), which were 0s. So row5 becomes:\n\ncolumns0-3: 0s; column4:8; columns5-8:8s (original); column9:8; columns10-14:0s.\n\nSo row5: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: original is [0,0,5,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Adding column4 and9 as 8s. So:\n\ncolumns0-3: 0s; column2 is5; column4:8; column5:8 (original), columns6-7:0 (original), column8:8 (original), column9:8; rest 0s.\n\nSo row6: [0,0,5,0,8,8,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: original is [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Add column4 and9 as8:\n\nrow7: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: columns4-9 set to8. Original row8 is all zeros. So:\n\n[0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0] remains the same.\n\nRow10-14: all zeros except row13 has a5.\n\nWait, but row13's 5 is at column5 (index5), which is outside the border of the 8s (columns4-9). So no change there.\n\nSo the final output would have the 8s border as described, and all 5s remain in place.\n\nNow, let's verify with the training examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has a border of 3s around the original 3s block. The 5s in the input are preserved. Similarly, here, the 5s are preserved, and the 8s' border is added.\n\nYes, this seems correct.",
