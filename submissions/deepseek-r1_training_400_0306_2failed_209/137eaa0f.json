        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Looking at the training examples, each input is a grid of numbers (probably 11x11 based on the examples) and the output is a smaller grid, maybe 3x3. The goal is to see how the input transforms into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has several rows with non-zero numbers. Let's look at the output rows: [6,6,7], [0,5,7], [4,4,0]. Hmm. Maybe each row in the output corresponds to specific elements from the input. Let's check where the numbers in the output come from.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the second row has 6,6. The first output row is [6,6,7]. The 7 is in row 7, column 6 maybe? Let me check the input. The 7s are in row 7 (columns 6) and row 8 (columns 5 and 6). Wait, the output's first row is 6,6,7. The 6s are from row 1 (columns 6 and 7). Then the 7 might be from row 7 (column 6) and row 8 (column 6). But the output's third element is 7, maybe combining those.\n\nThe second output row is [0,5,7]. The 5s in the input are in row 2 (columns 3 and 7). So the middle element here is 5. Then 7 could be from row 8, column 6. Not sure yet.\n\nThird output row is [4,4,0]. The 4s are in row 3 (columns 2 and 3). So maybe each output row is taking elements from specific positions in the input rows.\n\nWait, maybe it's about grouping numbers in the input. For example, in the output of Example 0, the first row of the output has 6,6,7. The input has 6s in row 1 (columns 6 and7), and a 7 in row7 (column6) and row8 (column6). Maybe the output is taking the non-zero numbers from certain regions and arranging them in the output rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by looking for the three highest numbers in the input and grouping them with adjacent numbers. But in Example 0, the numbers are 7,6,5,4. The output includes 6,6,7; then 5,7; then 4,4. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output: [6,2,2], [7,5,7], [3,3,3]. The input has a 6 in row2 column1, 2s in row8 columns2-3, 3s in row8 columns6-8 (but output has three 3s). The 7s are in row3 columns4 and6. The 5s are in row3 column3 and row9 column2. So the output rows might be collecting the highest numbers from different parts of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to a diagonal in the input. Let me check the positions.\n\nIn Example 0's output first row [6,6,7]. The 6s in the input are at (1,6) and (1,7). The 7 is at (7,6) and (8,6). Not sure if diagonals. Maybe the output is capturing clusters of numbers. Like, each cluster becomes a row in the output, ordered by their vertical position. For example, the 6s in row1, then 5s in row2 and row3, then 4s in row3, then 7s in rows7 and8.\n\nBut how are they arranged into the 3x3 output? Let's see the output for Example0:\n\n6 6 7\n\n0 5 7\n\n4 4 0\n\nSo the first row has 6,6,7. The second row 0,5,7. Third 4,4,0. Maybe each column of the output represents a vertical section of the input. Or perhaps each output row is a horizontal slice. Alternatively, the output is taking the non-zero numbers from certain positions and placing them in a 3x3 grid, ordered in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by looking at the positions of non-zero numbers in the input grid, grouping them into 3x3 blocks, and then taking the maximum or sum or some other aggregation. But the output numbers are exact matches from the input, so aggregation like sum isn't the case.\n\nWait, let's look at the input and output of Example0. The output has three rows. Let's check the positions of the non-zero numbers in the input:\n\nRow1 (index 0? Or maybe rows are 0-based? Let's see. The input in Example0 has rows:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: 0s except 6,6 at positions 6 and7.\n\nRow2: 5 at positions3 and7.\n\nRow3: 4 at positions2 and3.\n\nRow7: 7 at position6.\n\nRow8: 5 and7 at positions5 and6.\n\nSo non-zero numbers are in rows1,2,3,7,8.\n\nThe output has three rows. Maybe each output row is combining two input rows. For example, first output row combines rows1 and7-8 (where 6,6 and 7 are), second row combines rows2 and3 (5 and4,4), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is capturing the three largest numbers in the input, but ordered in some way. In Example0, the numbers are 7,6,5,4. The output's first row has 6,6,7 (so 7 is highest), then 5 and7 again (maybe a different 7?), and then 4,4. But there's only one 7 in the input. Wait, no, in Example0's input, there's a 7 in row7 (position6) and another 7 in row8 (position6). Wait, looking at Example0's input:\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,5,7,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo there are two 7s: row7 column6 (7th index?), and row8 column6. So the first output row's third element is 7, which could be from row7. The second output row's third element is 7 from row8. But then the 5 in the second output row is from row2 or row8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is grouping numbers that are connected in the input. For example, the two 6s in row1 are adjacent, so they form a group, then the 7s in rows7 and8 are connected vertically? Then each group is represented in the output. But the output is a 3x3 grid, which would require three groups. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nGroup1: the two 6s in row1 (adjacent horizontally).\n\nGroup2: the two 5s in row2 and row8 (but they are not adjacent. Or maybe row2 has a single 5, row8 has a 5 and a 7. Hmm.)\n\nGroup3: the two 4s in row3.\n\nThen the 7s in rows7 and8. But the output has three rows, each with three elements, but how are these groups arranged?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows might be formed by taking the leftmost, middle, and rightmost non-zero groups in each third of the input grid. For example, the input grid is split vertically into thirds (left, middle, right), and for each third, the non-zero groups are collected into the output rows.\n\nBut looking at Example0's output:\n\nFirst row: 6,6,7. The 6s are in the middle-right part of the input. The 7 is in the middle.\n\nSecond row: 0,5,7. The 5 is in row2, column3 (left-middle?), and the 7 is in row8, column6 (middle-right).\n\nThird row:4,4,0. The 4s are in row3, columns2-3 (left-middle).\n\nNot sure. Maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to a 3x3 section of the input. For example, the input is divided into 3x3 regions (but 11x11 can't be divided evenly into 3x3). Alternatively, maybe each row of the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from three specific rows of the input, and the columns are arranged left to right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the non-zero numbers from each third of the input grid (like top third, middle third, bottom third), and for each, taking the leftmost, middle, and rightmost non-zero clusters.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output rows as being composed of numbers from certain layers. For example, in Example0's output:\n\nFirst row: 6,6,7. These numbers are from the top part (row1, row7, row8).\n\nSecond row: 5 and 7 from middle rows (row2, row8).\n\nThird row:4,4 from row3.\n\nBut how exactly?\n\nLooking at Example1's output:\n\n[6,2,2]\n\n[7,5,7]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nIn the input of Example1, the 6 is in row2 column1. The 2s are in row8 columns2-3. The 7s in row3 columns4,6. The 5s in row3 column3 and row9 column3. The 3s in row8 columns6-8.\n\nSo output rows might be:\n\nFirst row: 6 from row2, 2s from row8.\n\nSecond row: 7,5,7 from row3.\n\nThird row: 3s from row8.\n\nBut again, the logic is unclear.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output structure, each row of the output has three elements. Maybe each element in the output row corresponds to a specific position in the input's rows. For example, for each output row, take the first non-zero element from three different input rows.\n\nBut in Example0's output first row: 6,6,7. The 6s come from row1 (columns6 and7), and 7 from row7 or8. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is generated by scanning the input grid from top to bottom and left to right, collecting sequences of non-zero numbers and placing them into the output rows. Each output row represents a group of numbers that are aligned in some way.\n\nIn Example0's input, the first non-zero numbers are the two 6s in row1. Then the 5s in row2 and row3. Then 4s in row3. Then 7s in row7 and8. The output rows are [6,6,7], [0,5,7], [4,4,0]. So maybe each output row is combining elements from different parts of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by looking for numbers in the same diagonal. For instance, in Example0's input, the 6s in row1 are at columns6-7, then 7 in row7 column6. So these could form a diagonal going down-left. Then the 5 in row2 column3, then another 5 in row3 column7. Then 4s in row3 columns2-3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe each output row is taking three consecutive non-zero numbers in a diagonal. For Example0's first output row: 6,6,7. Let's see their positions. The first 6 is in row1 column6, next 6 in row1 column7, then 7 in row7 column6. That doesn't form a diagonal. Alternatively, 6 in row1 column6, then maybe moving down and left. Row7 column6 is 7. But row1 to row7 is 6 steps down. Not consecutive.\n\nAnother idea: the output is created by taking the maximum number in each of three vertical sections (left, middle, right) across three horizontal sections (top, middle, bottom). For example, the input is divided into three horizontal sections (e.g., top third, middle third, bottom third), and each of those is divided into three vertical sections. Then for each of the 3x3 sections, take the maximum value. But in Example0's input, the top third would include rows0-3. The middle rows4-7, bottom rows8-10.\n\nFor top third:\n\nLeft section (columns0-3): the 4s in row3 columns2-3. Max is 4.\n\nMiddle section (columns4-6): 0s except row2 column3 (5?), but not sure. Wait, row2 column3 is 5. Row3 columns2-3 have 4s. Maybe in top third's middle section, the max is 5. Then the right section (columns7-10) would have 6s and 5. Hmm, but the output first row is [6,6,7], which might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero numbers from the top, middle, and bottom parts of the input grid, selecting three groups each. For example, each output row represents a horizontal layer, and the columns are the left, middle, right parts of that layer.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example0, the first output row's elements are 6,6,7. The 6s are from the top part (row1), and the 7 from the middle (row7). The second output row's elements are 0,5,7. The 5 is from row2, the 7 from row8. The third output row's elements are 4,4,0. The 4s are from row3. So maybe the output is combining numbers from different layers vertically but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to a certain number of layers. For instance, first output row takes the highest numbers from the first third of the input rows, the second output row from the middle third, and the third from the bottom third. But Example0's input has 11 rows, so thirds would be roughly 3-4 rows each. Not sure.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let's look at the positions of the numbers in the output and see if they correspond to specific positions in the input.\n\nIn Example0's output first row: 6,6,7. The 6s are in row1, columns6 and7. The 7 is in row7, column6. So (1,6), (1,7), (7,6). What's the pattern here? Maybe these are the positions of the numbers when scanned in a certain order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the first three clusters of numbers in the input, ordered from top to bottom, left to right. Each cluster's numbers are arranged in the output row. For example, the first cluster is the two 6s in row1, next the 5s in row2 and3, then the 4s in row3. Then the 7s in row7 and8. But the output has three rows. Maybe each row in the output is a cluster, ordered by the cluster's vertical position. So first cluster (6s) \u2192 first output row, next (5s) \u2192 second row, next (4s) \u2192 third row. But in Example0's output, the first row includes the 7s as well. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the first row is [6,6,7]. The 7s are in lower rows than the 6s. So perhaps the clusters are ordered by their vertical positions. Let's see:\n\nCluster 1: 6s in row1.\n\nCluster2: 5s in row2 and3.\n\nCluster3: 4s in row3.\n\nCluster4: 7s in row7 and8.\n\nBut the output has three rows, so perhaps the three largest clusters. But the 6s are two, 5s are two (row2 and8?), 4s two, 7s two. So why the first output row includes 6,6,7. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the output are taken from the positions that form a diamond shape or some other structure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the positions of the output numbers in the input grid for each example.\n\nExample0's output:\n\nRow0:6,6,7 \u2192 positions (1,6), (1,7), (7,6) or (8,6)\n\nRow1:0,5,7 \u2192 (2,3), (8,5), (8,6)\n\nRow2:4,4,0 \u2192 (3,2), (3,3)\n\nBut why are these chosen? The 0 in row1's first element suggests that there's no number there. Maybe each output row corresponds to a diagonal in the input. For instance, output row0's elements are from (1,6), (2,7), (3,8), but those would be off the grid. Alternatively, each output element is from a different diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the numbers from specific columns in the input. For example, columns 6,7,6 for the first output row. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example1's output:\n\nRow0:6,2,2 \u2192 6 is in row2 column1, 2s in row8 columns2-3.\n\nRow1:7,5,7 \u2192 7s in row3 columns4 and6, 5 in row3 column3.\n\nRow2:3,3,3 \u2192 row8 columns6-8.\n\nSo the output rows are combining elements from different rows and columns.\n\nMaybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to a 3x3 section of the input. For example, dividing the input into 3x3 blocks. But the input is 11x11, which is not divisible by 3. Alternatively, overlapping blocks.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking three consecutive rows from the input and combining them. For example, rows 1-3, 4-6, 7-9. But Example0's output has elements from rows1,2,3,7,8. So maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: look at the test input and try to find a pattern based on the examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: all zeros.\n\nRow1: 9 at column8.\n\nRow2:9 at column7,5 at column8.\n\nRow3:4 at column0,9 at column7.\n\nRow4:5 at column1,4 at column2.\n\nRow6:8 at column7.\n\nRow7:5 at column6.\n\nRow9:5 at column3.\n\nRow10:2,2 at columns3 and4.\n\nSo possible non-zero numbers are:\n\nRow1:9 (column8)\n\nRow2:9 (7),5 (8)\n\nRow3:4 (0),9 (7)\n\nRow4:5 (1),4 (2)\n\nRow6:8 (7)\n\nRow7:5 (6)\n\nRow9:5 (3)\n\nRow10:2 (3),2 (4)\n\nNow, trying to apply the pattern from the training examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, each output row is a triplet. Let's see for the test input. What would be the three triplets?\n\nIn Example0, the first output row includes the highest numbers from the input. For the test input, the highest numbers are 9,9,9,8,5,5,5,4,4,2,2. So the output might start with the 9s.\n\nLooking at the positions of the 9s in the test input:\n\nRow1, column8.\n\nRow2, column7.\n\nRow3, column7.\n\nSo three 9s in rows1-3, columns7-8. Maybe these form the first output row.\n\nThen next, looking at 8 in row6 column7. Then 5s in row4 (5 and4), row7 column6, row9 column3.\n\nAnd the 2s in row10 columns3-4.\n\nIn Example0's output, the first row was two 6s and a 7, possibly from different rows. So perhaps the test output's first row would be the 9s from rows1,2,3. But the 9s are in row1 (col8), row2 (col7), row3 (col7). So maybe [9,9,9], but there are three 9s. However, in Example1's output, there was a row with three 3s. So maybe grouping all same numbers. But the test input has three 9s.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row could be the 9s from rows1,2,3. But how to arrange them into three elements. For example, row1's 9 (col8), row2's9 (col7), row3's9 (col7). So [9,9,9]. Then the second output row could be the 8 and 5s. The 8 is in row6, col7. The 5s are in row4 (col1), row4 (col2 is 4?), row7 (col6), row9 (col3). The 4s are in row3 (col0), row4 (col2). So maybe the second row includes 5 and 4. Then third row is 2,2 and something.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the pattern from training examples. Each output row has three elements, which are non-zero numbers from the input arranged in some way.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nThe first output row is [6,6,7]. These correspond to:\n\n6 in row1, col6.\n\n6 in row1, col7.\n\n7 in row7, col6.\n\nSimilarly, the second row is [0,5,7]:\n\n5 in row2, col3.\n\n7 in row8, col6.\n\nBut where is the 0 from? It's a placeholder, perhaps indicating no number in that position.\n\nThird row [4,4,0] from row3, cols2-3.\n\nSo maybe each output row corresponds to three positions in the input grid. For example, the first output row takes elements from (row1,col6), (row1,col7), (row7,col6). The second row from (row2,col3), (row8,col5?), and (row8,col6). The third row from (row3,col2), (row3,col3), and (row8,col7) which is zero.\n\nBut how are these positions determined? Maybe they form a certain pattern. For example, in the first output row, the positions are (1,6), (1,7), (7,6). The first two are adjacent in the same row, then the third is in a lower row, same column as the first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking three elements in a diagonal pattern. For example, the first element of each output row comes from the top-left, middle, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row corresponds to a triangle shape in the input. For example, first row's elements form a triangle with points at (1,6), (1,7), (7,6).\n\nBut without a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nAnother observation: in the output rows of the examples, the numbers are ordered such that in each row, the numbers are either in the same row or in a lower row. For example, in Example0's first output row, two 6s from row1, then a 7 from row7. The second output row: 0 (no number), 5 from row2, and 7 from row8. Third row: 4s from row3. So maybe each output row corresponds to a certain \"layer\" of the input, combining numbers from different rows but in a specific way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is formed by taking the first three non-zero numbers encountered when scanning the input grid in a specific order. For example, top to bottom, left to right. But the numbers in the output rows don't follow this order. For Example0's input, the first non-zero numbers are the 6s in row1, then 5 in row2, then 5 in row3, then 4s in row3, then 7 in row7, etc. But the output first row is 6,6,7. So perhaps they are grouped by proximity.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the three largest connected components in the input. Each connected component's numbers are arranged in a row. For example, two 6s connected horizontally \u2192 first row. Two 4s connected horizontally \u2192 third row. The 7s connected vertically (row7 and8) \u2192 part of the first and second rows. But this doesn't fully explain the outputs.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is a combination of numbers from different \"levels\" of the input. For example, each row in the output corresponds to a different vertical level, and the numbers are collected from those levels. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example0, the first row's elements are 6,6,7. The sum of their positions: row1, row1, row7. The average is (1+1+7)/3 = 3. The second row's elements come from row2, row8. The third from row3. So maybe the output rows are grouped by their row positions modulo 3. For example, rows 1,7 \u2192 (1 mod 3 =1, 7 mod3=1) \u2192 group1. Row2 (mod3=2), row8 (mod3=2) \u2192 group2. Row3 (mod3=0) \u2192 group3. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows correspond to different regions of the input grid. For example:\n\nFirst output row: numbers from the top-right region.\n\nSecond row: numbers from the middle.\n\nThird row: numbers from the left.\n\nIn Example0, the 6s are in the top-right, 7s in the middle, 4s on the left. So that fits.\n\nIn Example1, the first output row is [6,2,2]. The 6 is in the top-left, the 2s are in the bottom-middle. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to think of how the test input would be transformed based on the examples.\n\nTest input's non-zero numbers:\n\nRow1:9 (col8)\n\nRow2:9 (col7),5 (col8)\n\nRow3:4 (col0),9 (col7)\n\nRow4:5 (col1),4 (col2)\n\nRow6:8 (col7)\n\nRow7:5 (col6)\n\nRow9:5 (col3)\n\nRow10:2 (col3),2 (col4)\n\nLooking at the examples, each output row has three elements. Let's see possible groupings:\n\nThe 9s are in rows1,2,3. Each in columns8,7,7. So maybe they form a group. So first output row:9,9,9.\n\nThen the 8 in row6 col7 and 5 in row7 col6. Perhaps next row is 8,5,5. But there are multiple 5s. Then the 5s in row4, row7, row9. And the 4s in row3 and4.\n\nAlternatively, the second output row could be 5,5,8. Third row could be 4,4,2,2. But how to fit into three elements per row.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example2's output:\n\n[0,1,1]\n\n[1,5,2]\n\n[9,9,2]\n\nThe input for Example2 has 1s in row2, 1 in row3, 5 in row3, 2 in row4 and5, 9s in row9.\n\nThe output first row is 0 (no number?), then 1,1. Possibly the 1s from row2 and3. Second row:1 from row3, 5 from row3, 2 from row4. Third row:9s from row9 and 2 from row5.\n\nSo perhaps the output rows are formed by taking three clusters of numbers that are vertically aligned. For example, the first output row takes the leftmost cluster (1s in row2-3), second takes the middle cluster (5 and 2s), third takes the rightmost (9s and 2).\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nLeftmost clusters: row3 has 4 at col0. Row4 has 5 and4 at cols1-2. Row10 has 2s at cols3-4. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the test output's first row could be the 9s:9,9,9. The second row could be 8,5,5 (from row6,7,9). Third row could be4,4,2 or 5,4,2. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the three highest numbers. The highest are 9s, then 8, then 5s, then 4s, then 2s. So first row:9,9,9. Second row:8,5,5. Third row:4,4,2 or 2,2,5. But how?\n\nBut the examples don't always take the highest numbers first. For example, Example2's output starts with [0,1,1] which are lower than other numbers like5 and9. So it's not based on value.\n\nAnother idea: the output is constructed by looking at the input grid from the bottom up and left to right, collecting numbers and arranging them into the output rows. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output rows as the three most \"active\" regions in the input, each region contributing a row. Each region is a contiguous block of non-zero numbers. For example, in Example0, the 6s are a region, the 5s another, the 4s another, and the 7s another. But the output has three rows, so perhaps the three largest regions.\n\nBut the test input has multiple regions: the 9s in rows1-3, the 5 and4 in row4, the 8 in row6, the 5 in row7, the 5 in row9, and the 2s in row10.\n\nSo the three largest regions would be the 9s (three elements), the 2s (two), the 5 and4 (two), the 5 in row9 (one), the 8 (one), etc. So the first row would be the three 9s. The second row could be the 5 and4 in row4, plus the 8 in row6. The third row the 2s in row10 and the 5 in row9. But how to arrange into three elements each.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by taking the leftmost, middle, and rightmost clusters. For example, the leftmost cluster is the 4 in row3 and 5,4 in row4. Middle cluster is the 9s. Rightmost is the 8 and5 in row6-7, and the 2s. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at how the output rows are structured in the examples. For Example0, each output row has two of the same number and a third different. Example1's first row has 6,2,2, second row 7,5,7, third row 3,3,3. Example2's first row has 0,1,1, second 1,5,2, third 9,9,2. So maybe the pattern is to have for each output row, two of the same number and one different, or three of the same.\n\nApplying this to the test input: possible output rows could be [9,9,9], [8,5,5], [4,4,2]. But the test input doesn't have three 5s. Alternatively, [9,9,9], [8,5,5], [4,4,2], but how to get the 5s. The test input has 5 in row4, row7, row9. So three 5s? Let's check:\n\nRow4 has 5 (col1).\n\nRow7 has5 (col6).\n\nRow9 has5 (col3).\n\nSo three different 5s. So maybe the second output row is [5,5,5], but they're not contiguous. But in Example1's output, the second row is [7,5,7] which includes two 7s and a 5. So maybe the test output's second row could be [5,5,8], combining the three 5s and the 8. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are formed by taking the numbers from the input in a specific diagonal pattern. For example, starting from the top-right and moving down-left, collecting three numbers per row.\n\nIn the test input, the 9 in row1 col8 is top-right. Then moving down-left: row2 col7 (9), row3 col6 (0), which is zero. So that's not useful. But maybe ignoring zeros.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row takes the three 9s:9,9,9.\n\nThe second output row takes the 8,5,5. The 8 is in row6 col7. The 5s are in row4,7,9.\n\nThe third output row takes the 4,4,2. The 4s are in row3 and4. The 2s in row10.\n\nBut how to arrange them into three elements. Maybe the third row is [4,4,2], but then what about the other 2?\n\nAlternatively, based on Example2's output, which has a row with [9,9,2], which includes two 9s and a 2 from a different row, maybe the test output's third row is [2,2,5], combining the 2s from row10 and the 5 from row9.\n\nSo possible output:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[8,5,5]\n\n[4,4,2]\n\nBut the 4s are in row3 and4. Or maybe:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[5,4,8]\n\n[5,5,2,2] \u2192 but each row must be three elements.\n\nAlternatively, considering the test input's structure:\n\nThe 9s are in rows1,2,3. Each in different columns. Maybe the first output row is [9,9,9], combining all three 9s.\n\nThen the 8 in row6 col7 and the 5 in row7 col6 are adjacent diagonally. Maybe the second row is [8,5,5], including the 8 and two 5s (row4 and7?).\n\nThe third row could be [4,4,2], with 4s from row3 and4, and 2 from row10.\n\nBut in Example0's output, the first row includes elements from different rows. So maybe this approach works.\n\nAlternatively, the output is built by taking the leftmost, middle, and rightmost non-zero clusters in the input. For example, the leftmost cluster is the 4 in row3, the middle is the 9s, and the rightmost is the 8 and5. But again, how to form the rows.\n\nAnother angle: in the training examples, the output rows seem to combine elements from different vertical layers. For instance, Example0's first output row has 6s from row1 and a 7 from row7. So maybe each output row is a combination of the earliest (topmost) and latest (bottom) numbers in their respective columns.\n\nAlternatively, think of each output row as a vertical slice. For example, columns 6-8 in the input form the first output row. Columns 3-5 form the second, and columns0-2 the third. But in Example0's input, the first output row's elements are in columns6,7,6. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, the output's columns correspond to the left, middle, and right parts of the input. For each part, take the highest numbers from different rows.\n\nFor example, in the test input:\n\nLeft part (columns0-3):\n\nRow3 has 4 (col0), row4 has5 (col1),4 (col2), row9 has5 (col3), row10 has2 (col3).\n\nMiddle part (columns4-6):\n\nRow2 has5 (col8?), wait maybe not. Columns4-6: row4 has nothing, row6 has8 in col7 (which is right part). Hmm.\n\nRight part (columns7-10):\n\nRows1-3 have9s in cols7-8, row6 has8 in col7, row7 has5 in col6 (middle part?), etc.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Perhaps I should make a guess based on the examples and the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input's non-zero numbers:\n\nThe three 9s are likely to form the first output row: [9,9,9].\n\nThen the 8 and two 5s (row7 and row4? Or row4,7,9's 5s). So perhaps [8,5,5].\n\nThird row could be the 4s and 2s: [4,4,2].\n\nBut the test input has two 4s (row3 and4) and two 2s (row10).\n\nAlternatively, the third row is [5,4,2], combining the 5 from row9, 4 from row3 or4, and 2 from row10.\n\nBut how to align this with the examples. In Example0, the third output row is [4,4,0], which are the two 4s from row3. So maybe the 4s in the test input form part of the third row.\n\nPutting it all together, maybe the output is:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[8,5,5]\n\n[4,4,2]\n\nBut the test input's 2s are in row10, cols3 and4. Are there other numbers to include?\n\nAlternatively, the second row could be [5,8,5], combining the 5s from row4,7, and9. But the 8 is in row6. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, the second row is [5,4,8], taking 5 from row4,4 from row4, and 8 from row6. Then third row [5,2,2], taking 5 from row9 and 2s from row10.\n\nBut this is just guessing. The examples show that sometimes zeros are present in the output when there's no number. For example, Example0's second output row has a 0. So in the test case, if there's no third element for a row, it could be zero.\n\nBut I'm not certain. Based on the examples, the output seems to collect numbers from different parts of the input, possibly grouped by their position and value. Given the complexity, I'll make an educated guess that the test output is:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[5,5,8]\n\n[4,4,2]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, considering the position of the numbers:\n\nThe three 9s are in rows1,2,3, cols8,7,7. So the first output row is [9,9,9].\n\nThe 8 is in row6, col7. The 5s are in row4 (col1), row7 (col6), row9 (col3). So perhaps the second row is [5,5,8], but how to order.\n\nThe third row could be the 4s from row3 (col0) and row4 (col2), and the 2s from row10 (cols3 and4). But this would require three elements. Maybe [4,4,2], but where is the third element? There are two 4s and two 2s. So perhaps [4,4,2] with the third element being 2, but leaving one 2 out. Or maybe [4,5,2], including the row9's 5.\n\nAlternatively, the third row is [4,4,0], but there's no zero in that row's data.\n\nAlternatively, the third row is [2,2,5], taking the 2s from row10 and the 5 from row9.\n\nBut this is speculative. Given the examples, especially Example2 where the output combines numbers from different rows and columns, I'll proceed with the following test output:\n\n[9,9,9]\n\n[5,5,8]\n\n[4,4,2]",
        "initial_response_1": "[9, 9, 9]\n[5, 5, 8]\n[4, 4, 2]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input grids with numbers and zeros, and the outputs are smaller grids. The goal is to see how the input maps to the output. Let's look at the training examples first.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 11x11 grid. The output is a 3x3 grid. Let me see what's in the input. The first input row has all zeros except for some 6s and 5s and 4s and a 7. The output has [6,6,7], [0,5,7], [4,4,0]. Hmm. Maybe the output is taking certain elements from the input. Let's check the positions. Let me count the rows and columns. The input has 11 rows and 11 columns. Maybe each cell in the 3x3 output corresponds to a section of the input grid. Like, dividing the 11x11 into 3x3 regions, but 11 divided by 3 is not exact. Wait, maybe each output row comes from a specific row in the input. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first row of the output is [6,6,7]. Looking at the input, row 1 (0-indexed?) has 6,6 in positions 6 and 7. Then row 7 has a 7. Wait, the input rows are:\n\nRow 1 (second row): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]. So positions 6 and 7 are 6 and 6.\n\nRow 7 (eighth row): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,7,0,0,0,0]. Position 6 is 7.\n\nThen the output's first row is [6,6,7]. Maybe combining these. But how?\n\nWait, the output has three rows. Let's see. Maybe for each of the three output rows, we take three elements from different rows in the input, perhaps the middle of each third of the input rows. Since the input has 11 rows, maybe split into groups of 3,4,4 rows or something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output's three rows in Example 0: 6,6,7 are perhaps the non-zero numbers from certain positions. Like, the first output row's elements are from the highest non-zero numbers in some regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero clusters from the input and arranging them in a certain way. For instance, in Example 0's input, there's a 6,6 in row 1, a 5,5 in row 2 (but row 2's 5s are in positions 3 and 7?), wait row 2 in input is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. So two 5s separated. Then row 3 has 4,4. Then row 7 has a 7, and row 8 has 5,7. So maybe the output is combining the highest values from certain rows or columns?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nFirst row: 6,6,7. The 6s are from row 1, and 7 from row 7 or 8. Wait, row 8 has 5 and 7. So maybe in the input, the highest numbers in certain vertical columns? Let me check the columns. For example, in column 6 of the input:\n\nRow 0: 0\n\nRow 1: 6\n\nRow 2: 0\n\nRow 3:0\n\nRow 4:0\n\nRow 5:0\n\nRow 6:0\n\nRow 7:7\n\nRow 8:7\n\nRow 9:0\n\nRow 10:0\n\nWait, column 6 (index 6) in input for Example 0:\n\nRow 0: 0\n\nRow 1:6\n\nRow 2:0\n\nRow 3:0\n\nRow 4:0\n\nRow 5:0\n\nRow 6:0\n\nRow 7:7\n\nRow 8:7\n\nSo in column 6, the values are 6, then 7, 7. So maybe the output takes the first three non-zero elements in each column? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the maximum value from each quadrant of the input. But the input is 11x11, and output is 3x3. So perhaps dividing the input into 3x3 sections, each of which is roughly 3-4 rows and 3-4 columns. Then taking the maximum or sum or something from each section.\n\nLet me try with Example 0's input. The output is 3 rows. Let's see:\n\nOutput row 0: [6,6,7]\n\nLooking at the input's top third, middle third, and bottom third? If we split the 11 rows into three parts: 0-3, 4-7, 8-10. For columns similarly. Then take the max in each section.\n\nFor the first output row, maybe sections from the top third. But the 6,6 in row 1 (second row) would be in the top third. The 7 is in row 7, which is middle third. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, looking at each output cell as corresponding to a specific position in the input. For example, output[0][0] is the first non-zero in some path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by scanning the input grid in a certain order and collecting the non-zero numbers, grouping them into triples. But in Example 0's output, the first row is 6,6,7. The input has 6,6 in row 1 (positions 6,7), then 5s in row 2, 4s in row3, then 7 in row7, 5 and 7 in row8. So perhaps the non-zero elements are being collected in some order, perhaps left to right, top to bottom, but grouped into 3 per row. But the input has more non-zero elements than the output. So maybe only certain ones are selected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the last three non-zero numbers from each third of the input. Let's see: in Example 0's input, the non-zero numbers are:\n\nRow1: 6,6\n\nRow2:5,5\n\nRow3:4,4\n\nRow7:7\n\nRow8:5,7\n\nSo total non-zeros: 6,6,5,5,4,4,7,5,7. That's 9 numbers. Which would make a 3x3 grid. So the output is arranging these numbers into 3 rows of 3. But in what order?\n\nIn Example0's output, the first row is 6,6,7. The second row is 0,5,7. Third row 4,4,0. Wait, but the input's non-zero numbers are 6,6,5,5,4,4,7,5,7. So 9 numbers. So how are they arranged? The first row of the output is 6,6,7. The second row 0,5,7. Third 4,4,0. Wait, but 0s are present here, which are not in the input's non-zero. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by looking at the positions of the numbers in the input. For each output row, perhaps it's taking the maximum value from each of three vertical columns in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the transpose of the input's non-zero elements arranged into 3x3. But the numbers don't align.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input has non-zero numbers: 6 in row2, 5,7,5,7 in row3, 5 in row7, 2,2,3,3,3 in row8, 5 in row9. So non-zero numbers are 6,5,7,5,7,5,2,2,3,3,3,5. But the output is [6,2,2], [7,5,7], [3,3,3]. That's 3 rows with 3 elements each. So the output has 9 numbers. But the input has more than 9 non-zero. So how are they selected?\n\nIn Example1's output: first row 6,2,2. The input's 6 is in row2, column1. The 2s are in row8, columns2 and 3. So maybe these are the highest values in certain regions? Or perhaps, each output row is taking the numbers from a particular part of the input.\n\nAnother approach: looking for positions. Maybe for each output cell (i,j), it corresponds to a specific (row, column) in the input. For example, in Example0's output:\n\nFirst row, first column: 6. Looking at input row 1, column 6.\n\nFirst row, second column:6. Input row1, column7.\n\nFirst row, third column:7. Input row7, column6.\n\nSecond row, first column:0. Hmm, but where is the 0 coming from? Maybe a cell that's supposed to have a number but doesn't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is formed by taking the non-zero elements from specific rows in the input, in order. For example, in Example0's output:\n\nFirst output row: 6,6,7. These are from input rows 1,1,7? Or maybe the highest numbers from three different regions.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output dimensions: 3x3. The input is 11x11. Maybe the output is taking the center 3x3 of the input. But in Example0's input, the center rows would be around row5. But those are all zeros. So that's not it.\n\nWait, let's check the positions of the non-zero elements in the input for each example and see if they map to the output in some way.\n\nFor Example0's input:\n\nNon-zero positions (row, column, value):\n\nRow1: columns6,7 \u2192 6,6\n\nRow2: columns3,7 \u21925,5\n\nRow3: columns2,3 \u21924,4\n\nRow7: column6 \u21927\n\nRow8: columns5,6 \u21925,7\n\nSo the non-zero values are 6,6,5,5,4,4,7,5,7.\n\nThe output is:\n\n[6,6,7]\n\n[0,5,7]\n\n[4,4,0]\n\nSo the first row is 6,6,7. The 6,6 are from row1, 7 is from row7. The second row starts with 0 (maybe from row2's 5 but placed in the middle?), then 5 and 7 (from row8's 5 and 7). Third row is 4,4,0. The 4s from row3.\n\nHmm. It seems like the output is arranged by taking the non-zero elements from certain rows and columns, ordered from top to bottom, left to right, but grouped into three rows. But how exactly?\n\nLooking at the output for Example0:\n\nFirst row: 6,6,7 \u2192 row1 (6,6), row7 (7)\n\nSecond row: 0,5,7 \u2192 perhaps row2's 5 (but why 0?), row8's 5 and7\n\nThird row:4,4,0 \u2192 row3's 4,4.\n\nWait, but why the 0 in the second row? Maybe there's a missing element. Or maybe each output row corresponds to three input rows. Like, for the first output row, take elements from rows 1, 2, 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by scanning the input grid in a spiral or diagonal order and collecting non-zero elements. But that's a stretch.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output as layers. For example, in Example0, the first row of the output is the highest numbers from the input. 6,6,7. Then the next layer is 5,5,7, etc. But not sure.\n\nLet's check Example2. Input has non-zero numbers:\n\nRow2:1,1\n\nRow3:1,5\n\nRow4:5,2\n\nRow5:2\n\nRow8:5\n\nRow9:9,9\n\nSo non-zero values:1,1,1,5,5,2,2,5,9,9. But the output is [0,1,1], [1,5,2], [9,9,2]. That's 3 rows of 3. So the output has 9 elements. The input has 10 non-zero elements. So some are omitted. The output's first row has 0, which isn't in the input. So maybe the pattern is not just collecting non-zeros.\n\nWait, in Example2's output, the first row is [0,1,1]. The input's row2 (third row) has 0,1,1 in columns1-3? Let me see. Row2 is [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So columns1 and 2 are 1,1. So the output's first row starts with 0, then 1,1. But why the 0? Maybe there's a leading zero if the group doesn't have three non-zero elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to a specific set of three rows in the input. For example, output row0 is the first three input rows, row1 is next three, etc. Then, within those, take certain elements.\n\nFor Example0's output:\n\nFirst output row [6,6,7] comes from input rows 0-3? Let's see. Input row1 (6,6) and row7 (7) are not in the same set. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are formed by taking the first, fifth, and ninth rows of the input. But in Example0's output, the first row of the output is [6,6,7], which could be from row1, row7, row8. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the positions of the non-zero elements. For example, in Example0's output, the first element 6 is from row1, column6. Second element 6 from row1, column7. Third element7 from row7, column6. Then the next row starts with 0 (maybe row2, column3 (5) but in the output, it's 0?), then 5 from row2, column7, and 7 from row8, column6. The third row 4,4,0: 4s from row3, columns2 and3. \n\nThis seems inconsistent, but maybe there's a pattern where each element in the output is taken from a diagonal or specific offset in the input. For example, the first element in the output is from (row1, column6), second (row1, column7), third (row7, column6). Then next row starts at (row2, column3), but that's 5, but in the output it's 0. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is created by taking the non-zero elements in a specific order, such as from the right to left, bottom to top. For Example0's input, the non-zero elements are:\n\nRow1:6,6 (columns6,7)\n\nRow2:5,5 (columns3,7)\n\nRow3:4,4 (columns2,3)\n\nRow7:7 (column6)\n\nRow8:5 (column5),7 (column6)\n\nIf we list all non-zero elements in order from bottom to top and right to left:\n\nRow8:5 (column5),7 (column6)\n\nRow7:7 (column6)\n\nRow3:4 (columns3,2)\n\nRow2:5 (columns7,3)\n\nRow1:6 (columns7,6)\n\nWait, but this order would be: 5,7,7,4,4,5,5,6,6. Which doesn't match the output. The output is [6,6,7], [0,5,7], [4,4,0]. So perhaps not.\n\nAnother idea: Each output cell is the maximum value in a specific quadrant of the input. For instance, the input is divided into a 3x3 grid of regions. Each region contributes to an output cell. Let's see:\n\nFor Example0's input:\n\nDividing the 11x11 into 3x3 regions (each roughly 3x3 or 4x4). For example:\n\nTop-left region: rows 0-3, columns 0-3. The non-zero here is row3, columns2-3 (4,4). So max is4.\n\nTop-middle: rows0-3, columns4-7. In this region, row1 has 6,6. Max is6.\n\nTop-right: rows0-3, columns8-10. Zeros.\n\nMiddle-left: rows4-7, columns0-3. All zeros.\n\nMiddle-middle: rows4-7, columns4-7. Row7 has 7. So max7.\n\nMiddle-right: rows4-7, columns8-10. Zeros.\n\nBottom-left: rows8-10, columns0-3. Row8 has 5,7 in columns5 and6 (which may not be in this region). Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe this approach isn't working. The output's first row is 6,6,7, which would correspond to the top regions. But according to this division, the top-middle's max is6, top-right is0, and middle-middle is7. So the first row would be6,6,7. Which matches the first output row. Then the middle row of the output would be0 (middle-left),5 (middle-middle?),7. But middle-middle here is7. Hmm. Not matching exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the maximum values from each of the three rows in the input's central column areas. For example, looking at columns around the middle (column5) for each third of the rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to three input rows, and each output cell is the first non-zero in those rows. For example:\n\nFirst output row: rows0-3, columns0-3, but this seems not.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the positions of the numbers in the output and see if they form a pattern. For Example0's output:\n\nRow0:6,6,7 \u2192 these are from input row1 (columns6,7) and row7 (column6).\n\nRow1:0,5,7 \u2192 from row2 (column7) and row8 (columns5,6).\n\nRow2:4,4,0 \u2192 from row3 (columns2,3).\n\nBut how do these positions translate to the output? It seems like the output is collecting numbers from specific positions in the input grid, but not obviously.\n\nAlternative approach: The output is a 3x3 grid where each row corresponds to a specific cluster of numbers in the input. For example, clusters are groups of adjacent non-zero numbers. The output is arranged such that each row represents a cluster, with the numbers in the cluster ordered left to right. But in Example0's input, the clusters are:\n\n- 6,6 (row1, columns6-7)\n\n- 5,5 (row2, columns3 and7)\n\n-4,4 (row3, columns2-3)\n\n-7 (row7, column6)\n\n-5,7 (row8, columns5-6)\n\nSo there are five clusters, but the output is 3x3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the three largest clusters. Example0's clusters are 6,6 (size2), 5,5 (size2),4,4 (size2), 7 (size1),5,7 (size2). But output rows are 3, so not matching.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by taking the three rightmost non-zero values in each third of the input rows. Let's check.\n\nFor Example0's input:\n\nThe input is 11 rows. Split into thirds: rows 0-3, 4-7, 8-10.\n\nFor each third, collect the three rightmost non-zero values.\n\nFirst third (rows0-3):\n\nRow0: all zeros.\n\nRow1: 6,6 at columns6,7.\n\nRow2:5 at column3 and7.\n\nRow3:4,4 at columns2,3.\n\nThe rightmost non-zero in each row of this third would be:\n\nRow1:6 (column7).\n\nRow2:5 (column7).\n\nRow3:4 (column3).\n\nSo the three rightmost values are6,5,4. But the first output row is6,6,7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is built from the highest values in each diagonal of the input. For example, the main diagonal, then other diagonals. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by reading the input in a specific order, like a spiral, and taking every fourth element, but this seems too vague.\n\nLet's try to find a pattern that fits all examples. Let's look at Example1's output:\n\n[6,2,2], [7,5,7], [3,3,3]\n\nThe input non-zero numbers are:\n\n6 (row2, column1)\n\n5,7,5,7 (row3, columns2,4,5,6)\n\n5 (row7, column7)\n\n2,2 (row8, columns2,3)\n\n3,3,3 (row8, columns6,7,8)\n\n5 (row9, column2)\n\nSo the output has 6,2,2; then 7,5,7; then 3,3,3. \n\nLooking at the input's non-zero elements, the output seems to be:\n\nFirst row:6 (from row2), 2,2 (from row8)\n\nSecond row:7 (row3),5 (row3 or row7?),7 (row3)\n\nThird row:3,3,3 (row8)\n\nBut how are they ordered? The output's first row has 6, then two 2s. The 6 is in row2, column1. The 2s are in row8, columns2,3. The 7s are in row3, columns4,6. The 5s are in row3 and row7. The 3s are in row8.\n\nThis seems like the output is taking the non-zero elements from certain rows, but I'm not seeing the pattern.\n\nLet's look at the positions in the output. For Example1's output:\n\nRow0:6,2,2 \u2192 6 is from row2, column1. 2s from row8, columns2,3.\n\nRow1:7,5,7 \u2192 7s from row3 columns4 and6, and 5 from row3 column5.\n\nRow2:3,3,3 \u2192 from row8 columns6,7,8.\n\nSo the output is arranged such that each row corresponds to a different part of the input. For instance, the first row's elements come from rows2 and8, the second from row3, and third from row8. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output's rows have three elements, and the inputs have certain non-zero numbers arranged in groups. Maybe the output is taking the first three groups of non-zero numbers in the input, ordered by their row numbers from top to bottom, and each group's elements are placed in the output row.\n\nFor Example0, the groups are:\n\n1. row1:6,6 \u2192 group size2 \u2192 becomes first output row's first two elements, then next group's first element.\n\nWait, but the first output row has three elements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is built by taking the first three groups of non-zero numbers (regardless of size), and arrange them into the output rows, filling with zeros if necessary. For Example0, the groups are:\n\nGroup1: row1:6,6 \u2192 size2.\n\nGroup2: row2:5,5 \u2192 size2.\n\nGroup3: row3:4,4 \u2192 size2.\n\nGroup4: row7:7 \u2192 size1.\n\nGroup5: row8:5,7 \u2192 size2.\n\nBut the output is three rows of three elements. So maybe the first three groups contribute to the output, but their elements are spread across the output rows. For example, group1's 6,6 would fill the first two elements of row0. Then group2's 5,5 fills next two, but then we need three per row. This approach isn't working.\n\nWait, maybe the output is constructed by taking three elements from each of the three rows that have non-zero values. For Example0, the input has non-zero in rows1,2,3,7,8. The output has three rows, so maybe selecting three rows from these. For instance, rows1,2,3, but that gives four rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output rows as the three highest non-zero numbers in the input. But in Example0, the highest numbers are7,6,5,4. So 7 is in first row, third column. 6s are first row first two columns.\n\nThis might not hold.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the test input and see if applying a pattern from the examples can help.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0] \u2192 row1: 9 at column8\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,5,0,0] \u2192 row2: 9 at column7, 5 at column8\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0] \u2192 row3:4 at column0, 9 at column7\n\n[0,5,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row4:5 at column1,4 at column2\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0] \u2192 row6:8 at column7\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row7:5 at column6\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row9:5 at column3\n\n[0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row10:2,2 at columns3,4\n\nSo non-zero elements are:\n\nrow1:9\n\nrow2:9,5\n\nrow3:4,9\n\nrow4:5,4\n\nrow6:8\n\nrow7:5\n\nrow9:5\n\nrow10:2,2\n\nNow, the output should be a 3x3 grid. Let's see what the examples might suggest.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the outputs are composed of the non-zero numbers arranged in a certain way. For instance, in Example2's output, the first row is [0,1,1], which comes from row2's [0,1,1,0,...], so the first three elements, perhaps. But in Example2's input, row2 starts with 0,1,1. So output row0 is those three. Then row3 of input is [1,5,0,...], so output row1 starts with 1,5,0. But the output is [1,5,2]. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first three non-zero elements from each of the three middle columns. Or perhaps each output row corresponds to a horizontal triplet of non-zero elements in the input.\n\nBut looking at the test input, the non-zero elements are spread out. Let's try to find a pattern from the examples and apply it.\n\nIn Example0's output, the first row is the two 6s from row1 and the 7 from row7. Second row is 0,5 from row2 and 7 from row8. Third row is 4,4 from row3. So maybe the output is built by combining elements from different rows, perhaps vertically aligned.\n\nAnother observation: the output rows often have elements from different rows. For example, in Example0's first output row, 6,6 are from row1, and 7 from row7. Maybe columns are involved. Let's see the columns of the input.\n\nIn Example0, the first output row's elements are in columns6,7,6. So columns6 and7 in different rows. So maybe each output column is the maximum value in that column of the input. But for Example0's first output row, columns6 would be 6 (row1),7 (row7), so max is7. But the first output row's third element is7, which is from column6, row7. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, each output row corresponds to a diagonal in the input. For example, output row0 is the main diagonal, row1 is the diagonal above, etc. But not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the first three non-zero numbers from each of the three middle rows. For example, in Example0, the middle rows might be rows4,5,6 (which are all zeros), so that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking the non-zero numbers from the input in a specific order, such as top to bottom, right to left, and filling them into the output rows. For the test input, the non-zero numbers are: 9 (row1),9,5 (row2),4,9 (row3),5,4 (row4),8 (row6),5 (row7),5 (row9),2,2 (row10).\n\nOrdering them from top to bottom, right to left (i.e., highest row first, and within each row, rightmost first):\n\nrow1:9 (column8)\n\nrow2:5 (column8),9 (column7)\n\nrow3:9 (column7),4 (column0)\n\nrow4:4 (column2),5 (column1)\n\nrow6:8 (column7)\n\nrow7:5 (column6)\n\nrow9:5 (column3)\n\nrow10:2 (column4),2 (column3)\n\nBut this would give the order:9,5,9,9,4,4,5,8,5,5,2,2. Since the output is 3x3=9 elements, we take the first nine:9,5,9,9,4,4,5,8,5. But the test input's output probably isn't this.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to take the non-zero elements from the input, group them into triplets from top to bottom, left to right, and form the output rows. For the test input, the non-zero elements in order:\n\nrow1:9\n\nrow2:9,5\n\nrow3:4,9\n\nrow4:5,4\n\nrow6:8\n\nrow7:5\n\nrow9:5\n\nrow10:2,2\n\nSo ordered list:9,9,5,4,9,5,4,8,5,5,2,2. First nine elements:9,9,5,4,9,5,4,8,5. Forming three rows:\n\n[9,9,5]\n\n[4,9,5]\n\n[4,8,5]\n\nBut the expected output may be different. For example, in the training examples, the output rows sometimes have 0s where there are no non-zero elements. So perhaps the grouping is done per row, taking the first three non-zero elements from each row, but this doesn't explain the 0s.\n\nAlternatively, the output is made by taking the non-zero elements from the input's columns, starting from the rightmost columns. For example, in each column, take the first non-zero element from the top. Then arrange these into rows.\n\nFor the test input, the columns:\n\nColumn0: row3 has4.\n\nColumn1: row4 has5.\n\nColumn2: row4 has4.\n\nColumn3: row9 has5; row10 has2.\n\nColumn4: row10 has2.\n\nColumn5: no non-zero.\n\nColumn6: row7 has5.\n\nColumn7: row6 has8; row2 has9; row3 has9; row1 has9.\n\nColumn8: row1 has9; row2 has5.\n\nColumn9: no.\n\nColumn10: no.\n\nSo columns7 has multiple entries:9,9,8,9. Columns8 has9,5. Columns3 has5,2. Columns4 has2. Columns0 has4, column1 has5, column2 has4, column6 has5.\n\nBut how to form the output from this? If we take the highest column first, column7 (values9,9,8,9). Take the first three:9 (row1),9 (row2),9 (row3). Then column8:9 (row1),5 (row2). Column3:5 (row9),2 (row10). Column6:5 (row7). Column0:4 (row3). Column1:5 (row4). Column2:4 (row4). Column4:2 (row10).\n\nBut I'm not sure how this would form a 3x3 output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking the three highest values from the input, but in Example0, the highest is7,6,6,5,5, etc. The output includes 7,6,6,5, etc. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In the outputs of the examples, each row in the output has elements that are clustered in the input. For example, in Example0's output:\n\n[6,6,7]: these are all in the middle-right area of the input.\n\n[0,5,7]: the 5 and7 are in different rows.\n\n[4,4,0]: the 4s are in the upper part.\n\nIn Example1's output:\n\n[6,2,2]:6 is in row2, 2s in row8.\n\n[7,5,7]:7s in row3,5 in row3 and7.\n\n[3,3,3]: in row8.\n\nIn Example2's output:\n\n[0,1,1]: from row2.\n\n[1,5,2]:1 from row3,5 from row3, 2 from row4.\n\n[9,9,2]:9s from row9, 2 from row5.\n\nSo maybe each output row is formed by taking the first non-zero element from three different regions of the input. For instance, the top, middle, and bottom regions.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by taking elements from the top, middle, and bottom third of the input, left to right. For example:\n\nTop third (rows0-3), middle third (4-7), bottom third (8-10).\n\nFor each third, take the first three non-zero elements in row-major order.\n\nIn Example0's top third (rows0-3):\n\nNon-zero elements: row1:6,6; row2:5,5; row3:4,4. So first three are6,6,5.\n\nMiddle third (rows4-7):\n\nrows4-7: row7 has7. So first three would be7, then zeros.\n\nBottom third (rows8-10): row8 has5,7. So first three are5,7,0.\n\nBut the output is [6,6,7], [0,5,7], [4,4,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, for each third, take the non-zero elements and arrange them into the output rows. For Example0:\n\nTop third elements:6,6,5,5,4,4 \u2192 take first three \u21926,6,5 \u2192 first output row. But the output's first row is6,6,7. So not matching.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's try to find a different angle.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the training examples:\n\nExample0's output:\n\n6,6,7\n\n0,5,7\n\n4,4,0\n\nExample1's output:\n\n6,2,2\n\n7,5,7\n\n3,3,3\n\nExample2's output:\n\n0,1,1\n\n1,5,2\n\n9,9,2\n\nI notice that in each output row, the numbers seem to come from different rows and columns of the input. For example, in Example0, the first output row has 6,6 from row1 and7 from row7. The second row has 5 from row2 and7 from row8. The third row has4,4 from row3.\n\nSo perhaps the output is created by taking, for each row in the output, the first non-zero elements from three different rows in the input, ordered from top to bottom. For example, output row0 takes the first non-zero from row0, row1, row2; but in Example0's input, row0 has no non-zero. So maybe this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows correspond to the three most \"active\" rows in the input (with non-zero elements), and each output cell takes the rightmost non-zero from that row. For Example0:\n\nMost active rows: row1 (two 6s), row3 (two 4s), row8 (5,7). So output rows would be the rightmost elements of these rows. But row1's rightmost is6, row3's is4, row8's is7. This doesn't form the output.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the test input's non-zero elements:\n\nrow1:9 (column8)\n\nrow2:9 (7),5 (8)\n\nrow3:4 (0),9 (7)\n\nrow4:5 (1),4 (2)\n\nrow6:8 (7)\n\nrow7:5 (6)\n\nrow9:5 (3)\n\nrow10:2 (3),2 (4)\n\nIf the output is to be a 3x3 grid, perhaps the pattern is to take the three rightmost non-zero elements from three different rows. For example:\n\nrow1's rightmost is9 (column8)\n\nrow2's rightmost is5 (column8)\n\nrow3's rightmost is9 (column7)\n\nrow4's rightmost is4 (column2)\n\nrow6's rightmost is8 (column7)\n\nrow7's rightmost is5 (column6)\n\nrow9's rightmost is5 (column3)\n\nrow10's rightmost is2 (column4)\n\nSo the rightmost elements are9,5,9,4,8,5,5,2.\n\nIf we take the first three rows with non-zero elements: row1, row2, row3. Their rightmost are9,5,9. Then next rows: row4, row6, row7:4,8,5. Then row9, row10:5,2. But this gives three groups: [9,5,9], [4,8,5], [5,2,0]. So output would be:\n\n[9,5,9]\n\n[4,8,5]\n\n[5,2,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't fit. For instance, Example0's output starts with6,6,7. The rightmost from rows1,2,3 are6 (row1, column7),5 (row2, column7),4 (row3, column3). So it would be6,5,4. But the output's first row is6,6,7. So this doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output takes the three highest values in each of three vertical sections. For example, split the input into three vertical sections (left, middle, right), and take the highest in each for three different rows.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nLet's try to think of another approach. In the examples, each output row has three elements, and each element comes from a different part of the input. For example, in Example0's output, the first row's 6,6,7 are from rows1,1,7. The second row's 0,5,7 are from rows2,8. The third row's4,4,0 are from row3.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first three non-zero elements from the input when read in a specific order. For example, reading the input in a spiral starting from the top-right corner, then moving inward. But this is complex.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the transpose of certain parts. For example, in Example0's input, the non-zero elements are in certain positions that when transposed form the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by extracting the non-zero elements from the input in a specific diagonal pattern. For example, starting from the top-right corner and moving diagonally down-left. But this would require more analysis.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding the pattern, perhaps it's time to look for a different approach. Let's try to see the output dimensions. Each output is 3x3. The input is 11x11. 11 is an odd number. The center of the input is at row5, column5. Maybe the output is the 3x3 grid around the center of the input. But in Example0's input, the center is at row5, which is all zeros. So that's not it.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0's output, the numbers 6,6,7 are the largest values. Then 5,7. Then4,4. So perhaps the output is sorted by value in descending order, arranged in rows of three. But in Example1's output, 6 is the largest, then 7, then5, then3s. So the first row has6,2,2. Which doesn't follow descending order.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by the first three non-zero numbers encountered in three different diagonal passes of the input. For example, first pass top-right to bottom-left, then next pass shifted, etc. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a different pattern. Let's look at the output for Example0:\n\n6,6,7\n\n0,5,7\n\n4,4,0\n\nThe numbers here are arranged such that each column in the output is from different parts of the input. The first column is6,0,4. The second column is6,5,4. Third column7,7,0.\n\nLooking at the input columns:\n\nColumn6 in input Example0: in row1 is6, row7 is7, row8 is7. So column6 has6,7,7. The first output column is6,0,4. Doesn't match.\n\nColumn7: row1 has6, row2 has5, row7 has0. So column7 has6,5,0. Which matches the second output column:6,5,4. Not quite.\n\nHmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is constructed by taking the last three non-zero numbers from each third of the input's columns. For example, split each column into three parts, take the last non-zero from each part, and arrange them in rows.\n\nFor Example0's column6:\n\nRows0-3:6 (row1)\n\nRows4-7:7 (row7)\n\nRows8-10:7 (row8)\n\nSo the last non-zero in each third of column6:6,7,7. But the output's third column has7,7,0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, for each column, take the first non-zero in each third. For column6:\n\nFirst third (rows0-3):6\n\nMiddle third (rows4-7):7\n\nLast third (rows8-10):7\n\nSo column data for output:6,7,7. If each output column is formed like this, then the output would be:\n\nColumn0:0,0,4 (from column0's thirds: no non-zero in first and middle, row3's4 in last third?)\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nIn Example0's column0:\n\nAll zeros except row3 has4. So thirds would be 0,0,4. But the output's first column is6,0,4. So maybe column6's data is6,7,7, which would form the third output column. So maybe the output's columns correspond to certain columns from the input, and the output's rows are the thirds of those columns.\n\nIf that's the case, for Example0:\n\nOutput column0 corresponds to input column6: first third's value (6), middle third's (7), last third's (7) \u2192 6,7,7. But output's first column is6,0,4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output column corresponds to a different input column. For Example0's output:\n\nFirst column:6,0,4 \u2192 maybe column6 (6,7,4?), but not sure.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to think outside the box.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nExample0's output has:\n\n6,6,7\n\n0,5,7\n\n4,4,0\n\nThe numbers 6,5,4 are descending. 7 appears twice. Maybe each output row represents a different level of the numbers. Like, first row has the highest numbers, then next lower.\n\nBut Example1's output has 6,7,3 as the first elements of each row, which doesn't follow this.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the result of a convolution or some matrix operation on the input. For example, applying a 3x3 kernel that sums or takes max values. But the input is 11x11, and the output 3x3. So using a kernel size of 3x3 with stride 4. But the math doesn't add up (11-3)/4 +1 = 3. So maybe each cell in the output is the maximum value of a 4x4 region in the input.\n\nLet's check Example0's input:\n\nFirst output cell (0,0) is6. The top-left 4x4 region (rows0-3, columns0-3) has 4,4 in row3, columns2-3. Max is4. But the output's first cell is6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, kernel size 3x3 with stride 4. Let's see:\n\nFor Example0's input, first region is rows0-2, columns0-2: zeros. So max is0. But output's first cell is6. Doesn't work.\n\nHmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to a cell in the input's middle 3x3. For example, rows5-7, columns5-7. In Example0's input, those cells are zeros. So output would be zeros. But Example0's output has non-zeros. So no.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0's output, the first row's third element is7. In the input, the7 is in row7, column6. The row7 is the eighth row (index7), which is towards the bottom. So maybe the output is combining elements from the top, middle, and bottom of the input.\n\nFor example, each output row is composed of elements from the top, middle, and bottom thirds of the input. But how?\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples and the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input, the non-zero elements are:\n\nrow1:9\n\nrow2:9,5\n\nrow3:4,9\n\nrow4:5,4\n\nrow6:8\n\nrow7:5\n\nrow9:5\n\nrow10:2,2\n\nThe output examples seem to pick the non-zero elements from certain rows and arrange them in the output. For instance, in Example1, the output includes elements from row3, row8, and row9. So perhaps the output is constructed by taking elements from the rows with the highest non-zero count.\n\nIn the test input, row3 has two non-zeros (4,9), row2 has two (9,5), row4 has two (5,4), row10 has two (2,2). Others have one. So maybe these rows contribute to the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first three non-zero elements from the input when scanned from top to bottom, right to left. For the test input:\n\nRightmost elements per row:\n\nrow0:0\n\nrow1:9 (column8)\n\nrow2:5 (column8)\n\nrow3:9 (column7)\n\nrow4:4 (column2)\n\nrow5:0\n\nrow6:8 (column7)\n\nrow7:5 (column6)\n\nrow8:0\n\nrow9:5 (column3)\n\nrow10:2 (column4)\n\nSo rightmost non-zero elements are9,5,9,4,8,5,5,2. The first nine would be9,5,9,4,8,5,5,2,0. Arranged into 3x3:\n\n[9,5,9]\n\n[4,8,5]\n\n[5,2,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't match. Example0's rightmost elements would be6,5,4,7,7. Output is [6,6,7], which isn't the rightmost.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first three non-zero elements from each of the three middle columns. For example, columns5,6,7. Let's check Example0's input:\n\nColumn5: row8 has5.\n\nColumn6: row1 has6, row7 has7, row8 has7.\n\nColumn7: row1 has6, row2 has5.\n\nSo columns5,6,7 have elements5,6,7, etc. But how to form the output.\n\nFor the test input, columns7 has:\n\nrow1:0\n\nrow2:9\n\nrow3:9\n\nrow6:8\n\nSo in column7, non-zero elements are9 (row2),9 (row3),8 (row6), row7:0, etc. The first three non-zero in column7 are9,9,8. If the output's first row is these, then [9,9,8]. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is formed by taking the non-zero elements from three different columns. For example, the three rightmost columns in the input.\n\nIn the test input, the rightmost non-zero is in column8 (row1,9), column7 (row2,9; row3,9; row6,8), column4 (row10,2), etc. So the three rightmost columns with non-zero are 8,7,4. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make a guess based on grouping the non-zero elements by their row positions and arranging them into the output rows.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nThe non-zero elements are:\n\nrow1:9\n\nrow2:9,5\n\nrow3:4,9\n\nrow4:5,4\n\nrow6:8\n\nrow7:5\n\nrow9:5\n\nrow10:2,2\n\nArranged in order of rows, the non-zero elements are:\n\nrow1:9\n\nrow2:9,5\n\nrow3:4,9\n\nrow4:5,4\n\nrow6:8\n\nrow7:5\n\nrow9:5\n\nrow10:2,2\n\nThis gives a total of 10 non-zero elements. To form a 3x3 output, perhaps we take the first nine, grouped into three rows of three:\n\nFirst three:9,9,5 \u2192 row1, row2, row2\n\nNext three:4,9,5 \u2192 row3, row3, row4\n\nNext three:4,8,5 \u2192 row4, row6, row7\n\nBut this would give:\n\n[9,9,5]\n\n[4,9,5]\n\n[4,8,5]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't fit the pattern. For example, Example1's output has elements from different rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input in a specific order, such as reading each row from right to left, top to bottom, and taking the first nine elements, filling with zeros if needed. For the test input, the order would be:\n\nrow1:9 (rightmost)\n\nrow2:5,9 (right to left)\n\nrow3:9,4 (right to left)\n\nrow4:4,5 (right to left)\n\nrow6:8\n\nrow7:5\n\nrow9:5\n\nrow10:2,2 (right to left, but columns3 and4)\n\nSo the sequence would be:9,5,9,9,4,4,5,8,5,5,2,2. Taking the first nine:9,5,9,9,4,4,5,8,5. Arranged as:\n\n[9,5,9]\n\n[9,4,4]\n\n[5,8,5]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' structure. For example, Example0's input, when processed this way, gives elements in the order:6,6,5,5,4,4,7,5,7. Which would form [6,6,5], [5,4,4], [7,5,7]. But the actual output is [6,6,7], [0,5,7], [4,4,0]. So this approach doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I can't find a clear pattern, but the examples seem to arrange non-zero elements from the input into the output rows, perhaps with some priority to higher numbers or specific positions, I'll assume the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input in the order of their appearance from top to bottom, right to left, and filling them into the output rows. For the test input, the non-zero elements in this order are:\n\n9 (row1, column8)\n\n5 (row2, column8),9 (row2, column7)\n\n9 (row3, column7),4 (row3, column0)\n\n5 (row4, column1),4 (row4, column2)\n\n8 (row6, column7)\n\n5 (row7, column6)\n\n5 (row9, column3)\n\n2 (row10, column4),2 (row10, column3)\n\nSo the first nine elements are:9,5,9,9,4,5,4,8,5. Arranged into three rows:\n\n[9,5,9]\n\n[9,4,5]\n\n[4,8,5]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't match. For example, Example0's output would be [6,6,5], [5,4,4], [7,5,7], but the actual output is different.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by taking the first three non-zero elements from the first third of the input rows, then the middle third, then the bottom third.\n\nBut I'm out of ideas. Given the time, I'll take a guess based on the test input and examples.\n\nLooking at the test input's non-zero elements:\n\n- 9 in row1, column8\n\n- 9,5 in row2, columns7 and8\n\n- 4,9 in row3, columns0 and7\n\n-5,4 in row4, columns1 and2\n\n-8 in row6, column7\n\n-5 in row7, column6\n\n-5 in row9, column3\n\n-2,2 in row10, columns3 and4\n\nThe output examples seem to prioritize certain rows and columns. For instance, in Example0, the output takes elements from rows1,2,3,7,8. The highest numbers in certain positions.\n\nFor the test input, perhaps the output is formed by taking the highest values from the rightmost part of the input. So:\n\nThe highest values in the right part (columns7-10) are9,9,8. Then middle part (columns4-6) has5,4,5. Left part (columns0-3) has4,5,2,2.\n\nBut arranging these into 3 rows:\n\n[9,9,8]\n\n[5,5,4]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\nBut this is a guess. Alternatively, looking at the test input's non-zero elements in the rightmost columns:\n\nrow1:9 (col8)\n\nrow2:9 (col7),5 (col8)\n\nrow3:9 (col7)\n\nrow6:8 (col7)\n\nThese could form the first output row:9,9,8. Then middle part:\n\nrow4:5,4 (cols1,2)\n\nrow7:5 (col6)\n\nrow9:5 (col3)\n\nMaybe second row:5,5,5. Third row:2,2,4. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output is:\n\n[9,9,8]\n\n[5,5,4]\n\n[2,2,0]\n\nBut I need to align with the training examples' format.\n\nLooking back at the examples, the output rows often have elements from different rows but the same or adjacent columns. For the test input, the elements in columns7 and8 are 9,9,5,9,8. So maybe the output's first row is9,9,8. Then elements from columns6 and others:5 (row7),5 (row4),4 (row4). Then elements from columns3-5:5 (row9),2,2 (row10).\n\nSo output might be:\n\n[9,9,8]\n\n[5,5,4]\n\n[5,2,2]\n\nThis would give three rows, each with three elements. This fits the structure of the training examples, but I'm not certain. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this as a possible answer.",
