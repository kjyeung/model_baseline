        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by carefully analyzing the examples to understand what transformation is happening.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input is a grid of mostly zeros and some 8s. The output seems to replace some of the zeros with 5s and 8s in a specific pattern. Let's compare the input and output row by row.\n\nThe first row of input is all zeros. The output's first row is all 8s. That's interesting. The second row of the input is all zeros, but the output starts with 5s and ends with an 8. Wait, looking at the output rows, it seems like there's a kind of alternating pattern between 5 and 8. But how exactly?\n\nLooking at the input's fifth row: [8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]. The output for that row is [8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8]. Hmm. So maybe the original 8s stay, and the zeros are replaced with alternating 5 and 8? Or perhaps it's based on their position relative to the original 8s?\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's output, the first row is all 8s. The second row has 5s except the last element is 8. The third row alternates between 8 and 5 towards the end. Maybe there's a diagonal pattern here? Or perhaps it's a matter of filling in with 5s and 8s in a checkerboard-like fashion, but only in regions connected to the original non-zero numbers.\n\nWait, maybe the non-zero numbers in the input (like the 8s) are acting as some kind of \"seed\" and the output is creating a pattern that alternates between the original number and 5. For example, starting from the non-zero cells, each subsequent layer alternates between 5 and the original number. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the non-zero cells are 8s. The output has rows that start with 8s and 5s alternately. Looking at the fifth input row (index 4 if we start from 0), which is all 8s except the last three zeros. The output for that row starts with 8s, then 5, 8, 5, 8. Maybe the pattern is that each cell adjacent to a non-zero cell (in some direction) is filled with 5, then those adjacent to 5s are filled with the original number, and so on, expanding outward?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is built by starting from the non-zero elements and propagating 5s and the original numbers in a way that alternates as they move away. Let's check the structure of the output in Example 0.\n\nThe first output row is all 8s. But the input's first four rows are all zeros. Wait, that doesn't make sense if the non-zero elements are only starting from the fifth row. Unless the pattern is inverted. Wait, maybe the output is a mirror or some reflection of the input. Let me check the rows.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, the non-zero elements start at row 4 (0-based index 4). The output's first row is all 8s, which might correspond to the bottom row of the input. Wait, the input's last row (row 9) is [0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0], but the output's first row is all 8s. That suggests that maybe the output is a flipped version of the input, but with transformations applied. Wait, but the output has 10 rows, same as input. Let me check if the rows are reversed.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the last row is [0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0], and the output's first row is all 8s. That might not be a direct flip. Alternatively, maybe the output is generated by a process that starts from the bottom of the input and works upward, filling in layers of 5 and the original number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a \"spiral\" or expanding layers around the original non-zero elements. For example, the original 8s are kept, then surrounding cells become 5, then the next layer becomes 8, and so on. But how does that fit with the training examples?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The non-zero numbers are 1s. The output has 5s and 1s. For instance, the first output row is [5,1,5,5,1,5,5,1,5,5]. The 1s in the input are in positions where the output has 1s, and the surrounding zeros are replaced with 5s. But how are the 5s and 1s arranged?\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the first row has 1s at positions 4 and 7 (0-based). The output's first row has 1s at the same positions, and 5s elsewhere. But the next rows in the output alternate between 5s and 1s in a way that seems to expand from the original 1s. For example, the second input row is similar to the first, but the output's second row is the same as the first. The third input row has three 1s at the end, and the output's third row ends with three 1s. So perhaps the output preserves the original non-zero numbers, and replaces zeros with 5s, but only in certain regions.\n\nBut looking at Example 0's output, the zeros are replaced with 8s and 5s. So perhaps the replacement depends on the position relative to the original non-zero cells. Maybe the output is a checkerboard pattern starting from the non-zero cells, where each layer alternates between the original number and 5.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a pattern in the output numbers. For each training example, the output uses two numbers: the original non-zero number from the input (like 8, 1, 2) and 5. So 5 seems to be a special replacement value. The 5s and the original number alternate in a certain pattern.\n\nIn Example 0, the output starts with all 8s in the first row, then alternates 5 and 8 in subsequent rows. The pattern seems to be that for each row, starting from the top, the cells are filled with 8s and 5s in a way that alternates, but the exact pattern isn't immediately obvious.\n\nWait, looking at the first output row of Example 0: all 8s. The input's first row is all zeros. So how does that happen? Maybe the output is the complement of the input in some way. But that doesn't explain the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying a cellular automaton-like rule, where each cell's value is determined by its neighbors. But given that the input has only some non-zero cells, and the output builds a pattern around them.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's input, the 8s form a kind of staircase or zig-zag pattern. The output seems to create a filled-in version of that shape, alternating between 8 and 5. Similarly, in Example 1, the 1s form a vertical line in the input, and the output alternates 1s and 5s in a checkerboard-like fashion around them.\n\nWait, let's think of it as a BFS (breadth-first search) expansion. Starting from the original non-zero cells, each layer alternates between 5 and the original number. For example, the original cells are the first layer (original number), then the adjacent cells become 5 (second layer), then their adjacent cells become the original number again (third layer), and so on. This could create a checkerboard pattern expanding outward from the original non-zero areas.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example 0. The input has 8s in certain positions. The output has 8s and 5s. For example, the fifth input row (row index 4) is all 8s except the last three zeros. The output row for that index is [8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8]. The 8s are followed by a 5, then 8, then 5, then 8. This could be explained if those cells are at different layers of expansion. The original 8s are layer 0. The cells adjacent to them (the first zero to the right) are layer 1 (5), then layer 2 (8), etc. But how does the direction work?\n\nAlternatively, the layers might be determined by Manhattan distance from the original non-zero cells. For cells at even distances (including 0), they take the original number, and at odd distances, they take 5. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the fifth row's 6th element (index 6) is 5. The original 8s end at index 5. The distance from index 5 is 1 (Manhattan distance along the row), so that's odd, hence 5. The next cell (index 7) is 8, which is distance 2 from the original 8s (assuming vertical movement?), but maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the distance is calculated in all directions, not just horizontally.\n\nThis might get complicated. Let's check another example. Take Example 2's input, which has 2s. The output has 2s and 5s. The first output row is [5,2,5,2,...]. So the 2s are in their original positions, and the zeros are replaced with 5s in a checkerboard pattern. Wait, the first input row is [0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,0], and the output row is [5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2]. So the original 2s are kept, and the zeros between them are replaced with 5s. Then in the next row of the input, there's a 2 in position 4 (0-based index 4) which in the output becomes 2, and adjacent cells might be 5s. But this seems like the output alternates between 5 and the original number in the same positions as the input's non-zero cells, but with 5s filling the rest in a pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is such that every cell in the output is 5 unless it's part of a path that connects the non-zero cells in the input. For example, if the input's non-zero cells form a connected region, the output fills them with their original number, and the surrounding areas with 5s. But Example 0's input has non-zero cells that form a sort of connected shape, and the output alternates 8 and 5 in a pattern that might represent layers.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be generated by replacing all 0s with 5, except those in certain positions. But in Example 0, some 0s are replaced with 8. So that can't be.\n\nWait, looking back at Example 0's output. The first row is all 8s. But the input's first row is all 0s. So how does that happen? That suggests that the transformation isn't directly related to the input's non-zero cells in that row. Unless the transformation is based on the entire grid's structure, like flipping the input vertically and then applying some pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a mirror image of the input with some transformation. Let's check Example 0's input and output. The input's last row (row 9) is [0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0], and the output's first row is all 8s. If the output is reversed vertically, then the input's row 9 becomes the output's row 0. But in that case, the input's row 9 has 0s and 8s, but the output's row 0 is all 8s. So that's not a direct mirror. However, perhaps the output is built by reversing the rows and then applying a pattern where 0s are replaced with 8s and 5s in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be generated by starting from the bottom of the input and moving upward, creating layers where each layer alternates between the original number and 5. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the input's row 4 is the first with 8s. The output's row 4 is [8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8]. So perhaps the original 8s are preserved, and as we move up, each layer alternates between 5 and 8. For example, row 4 (input's first 8s row) in output has 8s followed by 5,8,5,8. Then row 3 in output starts with 5s, then 8s. Wait, the output's row 3 is [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,8]. So the 8 appears in positions 7 and 9. That might be connected to the original 8s in lower rows.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to think of another approach. Let's look at the positions where the output has the original number (8,1,2) and see if they correspond to certain patterns in the input.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 8s are in a staircase-like pattern. The output's 8s form a more filled-in staircase, alternating with 5s. Similarly, in Example 1, the 1s form vertical lines, and the output has 1s in those vertical lines but surrounded by 5s in a checkerboard pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a checkerboard pattern where the original non-zero cells are in one color (say, black) and the rest alternate between 5 and the original number. For example, if the original cell is non-zero, it's kept; otherwise, it's 5 if (i+j) is even, and the original number if (i+j) is odd. Wait, but in Example 0's first output row, all are 8s. Which would mean that the original zeros are replaced with 8s, but that's only possible if the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, the output is such that the original non-zero numbers are preserved, and the 0s are replaced with 5 or the original number based on their position in a checkerboard pattern relative to the non-zero regions.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is a filled version of the input where each \"wave\" of expansion from the non-zero areas alternates between the original number and 5. So, starting from the original non-zero cells (layer 0), the next layer (adjacent cells) is 5 (layer 1), the next layer (adjacent to layer 1) is original number (layer 2), and so on.\n\nLet's see if that works for Example 0. The input's original 8s are in certain positions. The output's 8s and 5s could represent their distance (even or odd) from the nearest original 8. For instance, cells with even distance (0,2,4...) are 8, and odd distances (1,3,5...) are 5. Let's check a cell in the output.\n\nIn Example 0's output row 0 (all 8s), which in the input was all 0s. If the distance is calculated from the original 8s, maybe those cells are at an even distance, so they become 8. But how does that work if the original 8s are in lower rows?\n\nAlternatively, the distance could be calculated as the minimal steps required to reach an original 8, moving in any direction (up, down, left, right). If that's the case, then the first few rows (rows 0-3) are quite far from the original 8s (which start at row 4). But in the output, row 0 is all 8s. That doesn't fit with the distance idea, because the distance would be 4 (from row 4 to row 0), which is even, so 8. But then row 1 would have distance 3 (from row 4 to row 1 is 3 steps down), which is odd, so 5. But in the output, row 1 is [5,5,5,...,8]. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction of expansion is upwards from the original non-zero cells. So starting from the lowest rows and moving up, each layer alternates between 5 and the original number. For example, the original non-zero cells (like in row 4 of Example 0's input) are the first layer (8). The next layer (row above) becomes 5. The layer above that becomes 8 again, etc. But in the output of Example 0, row 0 (the top) is all 8s, row 1 is mostly 5s with an 8 at the end. So perhaps each row alternates between 8 and 5 as you go up.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, the original 8s start at row 4 and go down. The output's first few rows are filled with 8s and 5s in a way that could correspond to layers expanding upward. For instance, row 4 (original 8s) is 8s. Row 5 in input has a 8 at position 5, but output row 5 starts with 5s and then has 8s. Wait, maybe it's not just vertical. Maybe the expansion is in all directions.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's look at Example 2. The input has 2s arranged in a pattern. The output has 2s and 5s. The first output row is [5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2], which corresponds to the input's first row [0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,0], replacing the 0s with 5 and 2 alternately. Wait, in the output, every other position (where the input had 2s) remains 2, and the 0s are replaced with 5, but only in the first part. Wait, no. The input's first row has 2s at positions 1,3,5,7. The output's first row has 2s at those same positions, and the rest are 5s. Except the last two positions in the input's first row are 0, and in the output they are 5 and 2. Hmm, that breaks the pattern.\n\nWait, the input's first row is [0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,0], output is [5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2]. So the output has 2s in the same positions as the input's 2s, and the 0s are replaced with 5 and 2 alternately. But how does that alternate? The output for the first row is 5,2,5,2,... up to the 9th element (index 8) as 5, then index 9 as 2. Wait, the original input's last two elements are 0, so the output replaces them with 5 and 2. That doesn't follow a simple alternating pattern. Maybe it's related to the row's parity. For example, even rows start with 5, odd with 2? Or maybe the parity of the cell's position in the row.\n\nLooking at the output's first row for Example 2: positions 0,2,4,6,8 are 5s (even indices?), but position 0 is 5, 1 is 2, 2 is 5, etc. So even indices are 5, odd are 2? But position 9 (index 9) is 2, which is odd. So yes, that fits. So the output replaces 0s with 5 in even positions and 2 in odd positions. But in the input's first row, the 2s are in odd positions (1,3,5,7). So the output preserves the original 2s, and replaces 0s with 5 in even positions and 2 in odd positions? Wait, no. Because the output's first row has 5 in even positions (0,2,4,6,8) and 2 in odd positions (1,3,5,7,9). But the input's 2s are in positions 1,3,5,7. The output keeps those as 2, and the remaining zeros are replaced with 5 and 2 in even and odd positions. So the replacement for 0 depends on their column's parity. For even columns (0,2,4,6,8), replace with 5; for odd columns (1,3,5,7,9), replace with 2. But only where there were zeros. But why would the replacement be the original number (2) in some positions?\n\nWait, that seems specific to Example 2. But in Example 1's output, the first row is [5,1,5,5,1,5,5,1,5,5]. The 1s are at positions 1,4,7. The zeros are replaced with 5s except in some cases. This doesn't fit the column parity idea. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the output is a result of each cell in the input being replaced with either the original non-zero number or 5, based on some rule. The 0s are replaced with 5 unless they are in a certain pattern relative to the non-zero cells.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the 5s and 8s form a sort of diagonal stripes. Similarly, in Example 1, the 5s and 1s create a checkerboard. Maybe the rule is that for each cell, if the sum of its row and column indices is even, it's replaced with the original non-zero number (or 5 if it was zero), and if odd, replaced with 5 (or the original number). But how does that apply when there are original non-zero numbers?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by a combination of two patterns: the original non-zero numbers are preserved, and the zeros are filled with a checkerboard of 5 and the original number, based on their position.\n\nWait, in Example 2's output, the first row's zeros are replaced with 5 and 2 in alternating columns. The original 2s are in columns 1,3,5,7. The replacement for 0s in even columns is 5, and in odd columns is 2. But why 2? Because that's the original number in the input. So maybe for 0s in even columns, replace with 5, and in odd columns, replace with the original number of that row or column. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, the replacement for 0s depends on the closest non-zero number. If a zero cell is in an even column (assuming columns start at 0), replace with 5; if in odd column, replace with the original non-zero number from the input. But in Example 2, the original non-zero number is 2, so in odd columns, zeros become 2. But in Example 1, the non-zero number is 1. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1's first input row: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]. The output row is [5,1,5,5,1,5,5,1,5,5]. So the zeros are replaced with 5 except in columns where there's a 1. Wait, the 1s are in columns 4 and 7. The output's row has 1s in those columns. The other zeros are replaced with 5s. So it seems that the output preserves the original non-zero numbers, and replaces zeros with 5. But that doesn't explain the other examples.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's input, the zeros are replaced with 8s and 5s. So perhaps when the original non-zero number is present in a certain region, the zeros are replaced with either the original number or 5 in a checkerboard pattern. For example, all cells connected to the original non-zero cells (in a certain way) are filled with alternating 5 and the original number, while other cells are filled with 5 or another pattern.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is generated by creating a mirror image of the input's non-zero structure and filling in the rest with 5s. But in Example 0, the input's structure is mirrored and filled with alternating 8 and 5. However, I'm not sure how that would work.\n\nLet's try to find a common pattern across all examples. Each example's output uses two numbers: the original non-zero number and 5. The 5s seem to fill in areas around the original numbers. The pattern appears to alternate between 5 and the original number in a checkerboard fashion.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nThe output starts with all 8s in the first row. Then each subsequent row alternates between 5 and 8. But the exact pattern isn't a simple checkerboard. For example, row 1 of the output is [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8]. The last element is 8. So maybe the direction or starting point of the checkerboard varies per row.\n\nIn Example 2's output, the first row is [5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2], which is a perfect alternation between 5 and 2. This suggests that for rows where the original non-zero numbers are present in a pattern, the zeros are replaced with alternating 5 and the original number. But how is this determined?\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output rows have the same length as the input rows. The output seems to start from the top, and each row is processed in a way that depends on the input's structure.\n\nLooking at the test input now might help. The test input has 4s arranged in a pattern. Following the pattern from the training examples, the output should replace 0s with 4s and 5s in an alternating pattern, preserving the original 4s.\n\nFor example, the test input's first row is [4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0]. The corresponding output row should have 4s followed by alternating 5 and 4. But looking at Example 0's fifth input row (all 8s followed by zeros), the output row is [8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8]. So after the original 8s, it's 5, 8, 5, 8. Similarly, for the test input's first row, the zeros might be replaced with 5,4,5,4. But wait, in Example 0's fifth row, after the original 8s, it's 5,8,5,8. So the pattern is 5 followed by original number, alternating. So for the test input's first row, the output would be [4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,5,4].\n\nBut looking at the other examples, like Example 2's first row, the pattern alternates between 5 and the original number starting with 5. So for the test input's first row, the zeros are replaced with 5,4,5,4.\n\nBut how about the other rows in the test input?\n\nThe second row of the test input is [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]. The output for this row might preserve the 4 and replace the zeros with 5s and 4s in a pattern. For instance, the 4 is at position 5. The output might look like [5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5]. But wait, in Example 0's sixth input row (row index 5) is [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0], and the output row is [5,5,5,5,5,8,5,8,5,8]. So after the 8, it's 5,8,5,8. So the test input's second row would become [5,5,5,5,5,4,5,4,5,4].\n\nFollowing this pattern, each row's zeros are replaced with alternating 5 and the original number (4 in this case), starting with 5 after the last original number.\n\nLooking at the test input's third row, which is the same as the second row. So the output would be the same as the second row's output.\n\nThe fourth row of the test input is [4,4,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]. The original 4s are at positions 0-2 and 5. The zeros in between and after would be replaced with 5 and 4. So starting from the original 4s, the zeros would alternate. For example, positions 3 and 4 (zeros) would be 5 and 4. Then position 6 onwards: 5,4,5,4,5.\n\nSo the output row would be [4,4,4,5,4,4,5,4,5,4].\n\nPutting this all together for the test input, each row's zeros are replaced with alternating 5 and the original number (4), starting with 5 right after the last original number in the row.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's sixth input row (row 5: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]), the output is [5,5,5,5,5,8,5,8,5,8]. So after the 8, the zeros become 5,8,5,8. So the alternation starts with 5 after the last original number.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2's first row, the zeros between the 2s become 5, but in that case, it's alternating 5 and 2 based on column parity.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit inconsistent. Maybe the alternation starts with 5 immediately after the last non-zero cell in the row. So for each row, after the last non-zero cell, the subsequent zeros are replaced with 5, original number, 5, original number, etc.\n\nSo for example, in the test input's first row: [4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0]. The last non-zero cell is at position 5. Starting from position 6, the replacements are 5,4,5,4. So the output would be [4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,5,4].\n\nIn the second row of test input: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]. The last non-zero cell is at position 5. The following positions 6-9 become 5,4,5,4. So the output row would be [5,5,5,5,5,4,5,4,5,4].\n\nSimilarly, for the fourth row of test input: [4,4,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]. The non-zero cells are at 0-2 and 5. After position 5, positions 6-9 become 5,4,5,4. Between positions 3 and 4 (after the first 4s but before the next 4 at position 5), those zeros would be replaced with 5 and 4? Wait, but those are between the two groups of 4s. For example, positions 3 and 4 are zeros between the first three 4s and the fourth at position 5. How would they be handled?\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input row (row 4: [8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]), the output is [8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8]. So after the 8s, the zeros are replaced with 5,8,5,8. So between the 8s and the next non-zero cell (if any) in the same row, the same pattern applies. But in this case, the entire row after position 5 is zeros.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: For each row, after the last non-zero cell, replace the following zeros with alternating 5 and original number, starting with 5. The zeros before the first non-zero cell are replaced with 5s. Wait, but in Example 0's sixth row (row 5), the input is [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]. The output is [5,5,5,5,5,8,5,8,5,8]. So the zeros before the 8 are replaced with 5s, and after the 8, it's 5,8,5,8.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n1. All zeros before the first non-zero cell are replaced with 5s.\n\n2. All zeros after the last non-zero cell are replaced with alternating 5 and the original number, starting with 5.\n\n3. Between non-zero cells in the same row, replace zeros with alternating 5 and the original number, but need to see examples.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 2's third input row (row 3): [0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0]. The output row is [5,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,5,2]. So between the 2s, the zeros are replaced with 5,2,5,2... but here, there are no zeros between the 2s. The zeros are at the beginning and end. The zeros before the first 2 are replaced with 5 (position 0), and after the last 2 (positions 8 and 9), replaced with 5 and 2. So positions 8:5, 9:2.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 7: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0]. The output row is [5,5,5,8,5,8,5,8,5,8]. So between the 8s at positions 3 and 5, there's a zero at position 4, which becomes 5. After the last 8 (position 5), the zeros become 5,8,5,8.\n\nSo between non-zero cells in the same row, the zeros are replaced with 5.\n\nBut in Example 2's input row 1: [0,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,0]. The output row is [5,2,5,2,2,2,5,2,5,2]. So between the 2s at positions 1 and 3-5, there's a zero at position 2 which becomes 5. Between the 2s at position 5 and 7, there's a zero at 6 which becomes 5. Then after position 7 (the last non-zero in the row), zeros become 5 and 2.\n\nSo the pattern is: zeros before the first non-zero \u2192 replaced with 5s. Zeros between non-zeros \u2192 replaced with 5s. Zeros after the last non-zero \u2192 replaced with alternating 5 and original number starting with 5.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's row 7, between the two 8s (positions 3 and 5), there's a zero at position 4 replaced with 5. So that's consistent.\n\nSimilarly, in the test input's fourth row: [4,4,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]. The zeros between the 4s (positions 3-4) would become 5s, and after position 5, it's 5,4,5,4.\n\nSo applying this rule to the test input:\n\nFirst row: [4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0] \u2192 after the last 4 (position 5), zeros are replaced with 5,4,5,4. So output row: [4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,5,4].\n\nSecond row: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0] \u2192 zeros before 4 (positions 0-4) become 5s; after 4 (positions 6-9) become 5,4,5,4. So output: [5,5,5,5,5,4,5,4,5,4].\n\nThird row: same as second input row, so output same as second output row.\n\nFourth row: [4,4,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0] \u2192 zeros between 4s (positions 3-4) become 5s; after position 5: 5,4,5,4. So output: [4,4,4,5,5,4,5,4,5,4]. Wait, but between the 4s at positions 0-2 and the 4 at position 5, there are positions 3 and 4 which are zeros. According to the rule, those become 5s. Then after position 5, it's 5,4,5,4. So the fourth row's output would be [4,4,4,5,5,4,5,4,5,4].\n\nFifth row: [0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0] \u2192 similar to fourth row, but the 4s are at positions 2 and 5. Zeros before position 2: 5s. Between 2 and 5: positions 3-4, zeros become 5s. After 5: 5,4,5,4. So output: [5,5,4,5,5,4,5,4,5,4].\n\nWait, but in Example 0's sixth input row (row 5: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]), the output is [5,5,5,5,5,8,5,8,5,8]. So between the last non-zero and the end of the row, it's 5,8,5,8. So after position 5 (the 8), the zeros are replaced starting with 5. So in the test input's fifth row, after position 5 (4), zeros at 6-9 are 5,4,5,4. So the fifth output row would be [5,5,4,5,5,4,5,4,5,4].\n\nContinuing this for all rows, the test input's output would follow this pattern. Now, let's check if this pattern matches the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\n- Row 0: All 8s. Wait, the input's row 0 is all zeros, so according to the rule, there are no non-zero cells. So how is the output all 8s? This contradicts the previous pattern. So there's a problem with my hypothesis.\n\nAh, this suggests that the pattern is more complex. In Example 0's input, the first four rows are all zeros, but the output's first row is all 8s, the second row starts with 5s and ends with 8. So my previous rule doesn't apply to rows with all zeros. So there's another aspect to the pattern.\n\nThis indicates that the pattern isn't just per-row processing but involves the entire grid's structure. Perhaps the output is generated by considering the input as a 2D grid and performing a flood fill from the non-zero cells, alternating between the original number and 5 as layers expand.\n\nFor example, each non-zero cell in the input acts as a seed. The first layer (distance 0) is the original number. The next layer (distance 1) is 5. The next layer (distance 2) is the original number again, and so on. This would create a checkerboard pattern radiating out from the non-zero areas.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's first output row. The input's first four rows are all zeros. The non-zero cells start from row 4. If the flood fill expands upward, then row 0 would be at a distance of 4 from the original 8s. 4 is even, so it would be filled with 8. Row 1 would be distance 3 (odd), filled with 5. Row 2: distance 2 (even) filled with 8. Row 3: distance 1 (odd) filled with 5. But the output's first row is all 8s, which matches distance 4 (even). The second row is all 5s except the last element. Hmm, this doesn't fit. For example, the second row's last element is 8. So maybe the distance calculation is not purely vertical but considers horizontal and vertical movement.\n\nAlternatively, the Manhattan distance from any non-zero cell. For each cell in the output, if the minimal distance to any non-zero cell in the input is even, use the original number; if odd, use 5.\n\nIn Example 0's first row, the minimal distance to the nearest 8 in the input is 4 (rows 0 to 4). If 4 is even, the cell is 8. Row 1's minimal distance is 3 (odd), so 5. But in the output, the first row is all 8s, which fits. The second row is mostly 5s but ends with 8. This might be because some cells in row 1 are closer to other 8s. For example, if there's an 8 in column 5 of row 5, the distance to row 1, column 9 would be 4 rows down and 4 columns left, totaling distance 8 (even), so 8. But this is speculative.\n\nThis approach requires calculating the minimal distance for each cell. Let's pick a specific cell in Example 0's output. Take the first row, last column (row 0, column 9). In the input, the nearest 8 is in row 4, column 0-5. The minimal distance would be 4 (rows down) + 5 (columns to the left) = 9 (odd), so 5. But the output is 8. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is built by reversing the rows of the input and then applying a transformation where each layer alternates between 5 and the original number. For Example 0's input, when reversed, the first row (original last row) has 0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0. The output's first row is all 8s. So perhaps reversing the rows and then expanding from the non-zero cells upward.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Another possibility is that the output is a result of iterating from the bottom of the input upwards and to the right, alternating 5 and the original number. But this is vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the pattern where, in each row, after the last non-zero cell, the zeros are replaced with alternating 5 and the original number starting with 5. Zeros before the first non-zero cell in the row are replaced with 5s. Between non-zero cells, zeros are replaced with 5s.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFirst row: [4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0] \u2192 after position 5: 5,4,5,4 \u2192 output: [4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,5,4].\n\nSecond row: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0] \u2192 before 4: 5s; after: 5,4,5,4 \u2192 [5,5,5,5,5,4,5,4,5,4].\n\nThird row: same as second \u2192 same output.\n\nFourth row: [4,4,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0] \u2192 between 4s: 5s; after: 5,4,5,4 \u2192 [4,4,4,5,5,4,5,4,5,4].\n\nFifth row: [0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0] \u2192 before first 4: 5s; between 4s: 5s; after: 5,4,5,4 \u2192 [5,5,4,5,5,4,5,4,5,4].\n\nSixth row: [4,4,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0] \u2192 same as fourth row \u2192 [4,4,4,5,5,4,5,4,5,4].\n\nSeventh row: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0] \u2192 same as second row \u2192 [5,5,5,5,5,4,5,4,5,4].\n\nEighth row: same as seventh \u2192 same output.\n\nNinth row: [4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0] \u2192 same as first row \u2192 [4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,5,4].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, there's more to it. For example, in Example 0's output, the rows alternate between starting with 5s and 8s. This suggests that the pattern isn't just per-row but involves the entire grid's structure, possibly with alternating rows.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's output, the first row is all 8s. The second row is all 5s except the last element. The third row starts with 8s, then 5s. It seems like there's a diagonal pattern from the top-left to the bottom-right. Maybe the output is a combination of filling from the non-zero cells in a way that alternates 5 and the original number as you move upward and to the right.\n\nBut without more time to analyze, I'll proceed with the per-row pattern where after the last non-zero, replace zeros with alternating 5 and original number. Applying this to the test input gives the following output rows:\n\nRow 0: [4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,5,4]\n\nRow 1: [5,5,5,5,5,4,5,4,5,4]\n\nRow 2: same as row 1.\n\nRow 3: [4,4,4,5,5,4,5,4,5,4]\n\nRow 4: [5,5,4,5,5,4,5,4,5,4]\n\nRow 5: [4,4,4,5,5,4,5,4,5,4]\n\nRow 6: same as row 1.\n\nRow 7: same as row 1.\n\nRow 8: same as row 1.\n\nRow 9: [4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,5,4]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs often have the original numbers preserved and 5s filling the rest in a checkerboard-like pattern. However, the test input's output might need to alternate 5 and 4 in a way that each row starts with the original number and alternates.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices in the training examples, then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a lot of zeros and some 8s. The output is filled with 8s and 5s. Let's see row by row. The first output row is all 8s. Then each subsequent row starts replacing some 8s with 5s. It looks like the non-zero numbers in the input (the 8s) form some kind of structure, and the output is building layers around them. Maybe it's filling in the areas around the original 8s with 5s in a certain pattern, like a spiral or expanding outward.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 8s form a sort of zig-zag pattern. The output seems to create a stepped pattern where each row alternates between 8 and 5, but in a way that decreases the 8s as we go down. Wait, looking at the output rows, the first row is all 8s. The second row ends with 8, and the rest are 5s. The third row ends with 8 and 5 in the 9th position. It's like each row is shifting the 8s to the left, but there's a pattern of alternating 8 and 5, maybe based on the original structure.\n\nWait another angle: the output might be creating a right-aligned pattern. For instance, in Example 0's output, each row from top to bottom has a decreasing number of 8s starting from the right. The first row is all 8s. The second row has all 5s except the last element is 8. The third row ends with 8, then 5 before, etc. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a kind of \"flood fill\" starting from the bottom or a certain direction. Let's look at the input of Example 0. The input's 8s are mostly in the lower rows. The output's first row is all 8s. Maybe it's flipping the input vertically? Because the input's 8s are in the lower part, but the output's first row is all 8s. Wait, the output's first row is all 8s, which doesn't directly match the input's top rows. So that's probably not a vertical flip.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The input has 1s in certain positions. The output uses 1s and 5s. For instance, in the first output row, the elements are [5,1,5,5,1,5,5,1,5,5]. The 1s are in the same positions as the input, but the rest are 5s. Wait, the input's first row has a 1 at position 4 and 7 (0-based index 4 and 7?), but the output's first row has 1s at positions 4 and 7. Then the 5s fill the rest. But the output seems to have 5s except where the original 1s were. But then looking at the next rows, it's similar. But in some rows, the 1s are preserved, and 5s fill other positions, but maybe also expanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is replacing all the 0s in the input with 5s, but the original non-zero numbers are kept. Let's check that. For Example 0's input, the original non-zero is 8. The output's first row is all 8s, which doesn't fit. Wait in Example 0's input, the first few rows are all zeros. But the output's first row is all 8s. So that theory is invalid.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is a mirror or reflection. Let's check the input and output of Example 0. The input has 8s in rows 4,6,8,9 (assuming rows are 0-indexed). The output's first row is all 8s, which might not be a reflection. Alternatively, maybe each row in the output is built based on the input rows below it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by starting from the bottom of the input and working upwards, creating layers. For example, in Example 0, the input's last row (row 9) has 4,4,4,4,4,4 followed by zeros. The output's last row is [5,8,5,8,...], which might not directly relate. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 0's output, the numbers 8 and 5 are alternating in a way that each row has a staircase-like pattern. The first row is all 8s. The second row has all 5s except the last element. The third row ends with 8, the one before that 5, and so on. The pattern seems to decrease the number of 8s from right to left as we go down each row.\n\nWait, maybe each row in the output is a shifted version of the previous row, replacing certain elements. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The input has 1s forming a vertical line and some in row 2. The output preserves the 1s and fills 5s around them. For example, in row 0 of the output, the 1s are in the same positions as the input, but the rest are 5s. But in row 1, same. But in row 5 of the input, there's a horizontal line of 1s, which in the output becomes [5,1,5,5,1,1,1,1,1,1]. So the original 1s are kept, and 5s are filled to the left. Wait, the input's row 5 is [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]. The output's row 5 is [5,1,5,5,1,1,1,1,1,1]. So the first element is 5, then 1 in position 1? Wait, maybe not. The input's row 5 starts with four zeros, then six 1s. The output's row 5 starts with 5,1,5,5, then the 1s. So it's replacing the zeros with 5s except where the original 1s were. Wait, but in the input row 5, the first four elements are 0s, which in the output are 5,1,5,5. That doesn't directly replace 0s with 5s. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait maybe the output is constructed by expanding the non-zero elements in the input to the left and right, replacing 0s with 5s in a certain way. Let's take Example 1's input. The first row has 0s and 1s. The output's first row has 5,1,5,5,1,5,5,1,5,5. So the 1s are in the same positions, but the 0s are replaced with 5s, but only some. Wait in the input row 0, the 1s are at positions 4 and 7 (assuming 0-based index). The output row 0 has 1s at positions 1,4,7. Wait, that's different. So the original 1s are at positions 4 and 7, but the output has 1s at 1,4,7. That suggests that there's a pattern of adding 1s in other positions. Or perhaps it's a horizontal mirror? For example, the output's first row has 1s at positions 1,4,7. Maybe the input's row has 1s at positions 4 and 7, but the output adds a 1 at position 1. That's not mirroring. Maybe a shift?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a result of some kind of cellular automaton where each cell is determined by its neighbors in the input. But that might be complex.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input. The input has 2s arranged in a certain pattern. The output has 2s preserved and 5s and 2s alternating in some rows. For example, the first output row is [5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2]. The input's first row is [0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,0], so the 2s are at positions 1,3,5,7. The output's first row has 2s at those positions, but also the last element is 2. So maybe extending the 2s to the end. Then alternating 5 and 2. But how?\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has the same dimensions as the input (10x10). The non-zero numbers in the input (8,1,2) are present in the output, but mixed with 5s. The number 5 seems to be a filler for certain positions.\n\nLooking for a pattern in how the 5s and the original numbers are arranged. Let's compare input and output rows:\n\nTake Example 0's input row 4: [8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]. Output row 4 is [8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8]. Wait, the input has 8s up to index 5 (0-based), then zeros. The output row starts with 6 8s, then 5,8,5,8. So it's like after the original 8s, there's a 5 and 8 alternating. Maybe the output is building a pattern where the original non-zero elements are extended with 5s and the original number in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the output is constructed by taking the original non-zero elements and then creating a pattern that alternates between 5 and the original number, starting from the left or right. For example, in Example 0's row 4, after the original 8s (positions 0-5), the next elements alternate 5 and 8. But the output row 4 is [8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8]. So positions 6 is 5, 7 is 8, 8 is 5, 9 is 8. So after the original 8s, it's 5,8,5,8. Hmm.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 5, the original 1s start at position 4 (0-based) with six 1s. The output row 5 is [5,1,5,5,1,1,1,1,1,1]. So positions 0:5,1:1, etc. It's not clear. Maybe the 1s are preserved, and the 0s are replaced with 5s except where there's a 1 to the right? Or something else.\n\nAnother approach: look at the positions where the original numbers are in the input and see how they appear in the output. For example, in Example 0's input, the 8s form a sort of inverted 'L' shapes. The output's pattern seems to create a sort of diagonal stripes of 8 and 5. Maybe the output is creating a right-diagonal pattern where each row shifts the starting point.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output rows:\n\nRow 0: all 8s.\n\nRow 1: ends with 8, others 5.\n\nRow 2: ends with 8, and the previous positions alternate 8 and 5.\n\nWait, perhaps each row in the output is constructed by starting from the right and filling 8s and 5s in a certain pattern. For example, the first row is all 8s. The second row has the last element as 8, and the rest 5s. The third row has the 8 in position 8 (second to last) and then 5 in the next. Wait, maybe not. Let's list the output rows for Example 0:\n\nRow 0: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8]\n\nRow2: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8]\n\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,8]\n\nRow4: [8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8]\n\nRow5: [5,5,5,5,5,8,5,8,5,8]\n\nRow6: [8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8,5,8]\n\nRow7: [5,5,5,8,5,8,5,8,5,8]\n\nRow8: [8,8,5,8,5,8,5,8,5,8]\n\nRow9: [5,8,5,8,5,8,5,8,5,8]\n\nLooking at these rows, the 8s form a diagonal pattern from the top-right, moving leftward as we go down each row. For example, the first row is all 8s. Then each subsequent row has one fewer 8 on the left side, creating a staircase effect. The rightmost element is always 8. Then, starting from the top, each row loses one 8 from the left, but alternates with 5s.\n\nBut how does this relate to the input? The input in Example 0 has 8s in certain positions. The output seems to create this diagonal pattern regardless of the input's 8s. Wait, but the input's 8s are in the lower half, but the output starts with all 8s. Maybe the output is not directly based on the input's non-zero positions, but instead the output is a standard pattern based on some transformation that the input triggers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a representation of the input's structure, where each non-zero in the input is replaced with a pattern of 5s and the original number. For example, each time there's a non-zero in the input, it creates a vertical line in the output of that number, and the surrounding areas are filled with 5s.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the 1s are in vertical columns. In the output, the 1s are preserved, and the 5s are filled around them. For instance, in the first row of the input, there are two 1s. The output's first row has those two 1s plus another 1 at position 1. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the output is a combination of the input and a certain grid pattern. For example, in the first training example, the output alternates between 8 and 5 in a checkerboard-like pattern that's modified based on the input's structure. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the input with 0s replaced by 5s, and non-zeros kept. But Example 0's input has many zeros replaced with 8s in the output, which contradicts that. So that's not the case.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's input and output:\n\nThe input's first four rows are all zeros. The output's first four rows start with all 8s and then have a pattern. So the zeros are being transformed into 8s and 5s. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the output is a mirror of the input's columns. For example, the first input row of Example 0 is all zeros, but the output's first row is all 8s. If we reverse the columns of the input, but that doesn't directly explain the 8s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number in the output is determined by the number of non-zero elements in the corresponding column or row of the input. For example, in Example 0's input, the last few columns (columns 6-9) are all zeros. But the output's first row has all 8s. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: The output in Example 0 seems to have a pattern where each row starts with a group of 8s, followed by 5s and 8s in a decreasing manner. The first row is all 8s. The next row has all 5s except the last element. Then the next row has 8s up to the eighth position, then 5 and 8. So it's like each row is losing one 8 from the left side and adding a 5, but the rightmost element is always 8. This creates a diagonal of 5s moving from left to right as we go down the rows. \n\nBut how does this relate to the input? The input's non-zero elements are in the lower half. Maybe the pattern in the output is generated based on the positions of the non-zero elements in the input. For example, the highest row in the input that has a non-zero element determines where the 8s start in the output. But in Example 0, the first row with 8s is row 4 (0-based). The output's first row is all 8s. So perhaps the output is built from top to bottom, and each row's pattern is based on the original non-zero elements in the corresponding row of the input, but adjusted in some way.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, row 4 has 6 8s followed by zeros. The output row 4 is [8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8]. So after the original 8s, it's 5,8,5,8. So the original 8s are kept, and then a pattern of 5 and 8 alternates. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, starting from the left, replacing 0s with 5s until the first non-zero is encountered, then replacing the rest with the original number and 5s alternately. But in Example 0's input row 4, after the 8s, the zeros are replaced with 5 and 8 alternately. But that's not the case for other rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the result of a maze-like fill, where starting from certain points (like the non-zero elements in the input), you flood fill the area with 5s, but the original numbers are preserved. For example, in the input, the non-zero elements form a kind of path, and the output fills all areas connected to the top or certain edges with 5s, while keeping the original numbers. But in Example 0's input, the 8s are in the lower rows, but the output's first row is all 8s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input's transpose. But the input for Example 0 has 10 rows and columns, and the output is the same size, so transpose would just swap rows and columns. But looking at the first row of Example 0's input (all zeros), the output's first row is all 8s, which doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output's rows are the input's rows processed in reverse order with some transformation. For Example 0, the input's rows 4 and below have 8s, and the output starts with all 8s. Maybe the output is the reverse of the input's rows, but with some replacement. But the input's last row (row9) has some 8s, but the output's first row is all 8s, which doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, the output is built by taking each row from the input and replacing the 0s with 5s, except for certain positions that form a pattern. For example, in Example 0's output, the first row has all 8s even though the input's first row is all zeros. So that theory is invalid.\n\nLooking back at the test input. The test input's non-zero is 4. The expected output should replace 0s with 5s and keep 4s, but perhaps in a pattern similar to the training examples. Let's see the test input:\n\nTest Input:\nRow0: [4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [4,4,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\nRow4: [0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\nRow5: [0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\nRow6: [4,4,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\nRow9: [4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking for a pattern similar to the training examples. For instance, in Example 0's output, the non-zero number (8) is preserved, and 5s are filled in a certain pattern. Similarly, the test input's 4s would likely be preserved, and 0s replaced with 5s in a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output structure, the first row is all 8s. Then each subsequent row has a 5 replacing an 8 from the left, creating a diagonal pattern. But how does that relate to the input? The input's non-zero numbers are forming a kind of vertical line and horizontal lines. Maybe the output is creating a spiral or layers around these lines.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a right-aligned pattern where each row starts with 5s and ends with the original number. For example, in Example 0's output, the last element is always 8. In the test input, the 4s are mostly in the sixth column (index5). So the output's rows might have 4s in the rightmost positions and 5s elsewhere.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's output, the 1s are preserved in their original positions, and other positions are 5s. But in the first row of Example 1's output, the 1s are at positions 1,4,7. The input's first row has 1s at positions4 and7. So why is there an extra 1 at position1? Maybe it's part of a pattern that extends the non-zero elements upwards.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a combination of the original non-zero elements and a pattern that fills upwards and to the sides. For example, in Example 1's input, the 1s are in certain columns, and the output fills those columns with 1s, but with 5s in between. \n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a reflection of the input's non-zero elements across some axis. For example, the test input has a sort of vertical line of 4s in the middle. If the output reflects this horizontally, but that doesn't explain the 5s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each non-zero element in the input and creating a diagonal line upwards and to the right, replacing 0s with 5s. For example, each 4 in the test input would create a diagonal in the output, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet's try to find a common pattern in the training examples.\n\nExample 0's output starts with all 8s. Each subsequent row has a 5 replacing one 8 from the left, creating a diagonal of 5s moving right as we go down. The last element of each row is always 8. This could be a pattern of starting from the top, filling with the original number, then each row reduces the number of original numbers from the left, replacing them with 5s, but keeping the rightmost element as the original number. But how does the input influence this?\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the first row with non-zero elements is row4. The output's first row is all 8s. So maybe the output is built from the bottom up, with each row's pattern determined by the input's rows below. For example, the number of non-zero elements in the input's rows determines how many original numbers are in the output's corresponding row.\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows are generated by taking the maximum value from the input's rows below. For example, if a row in the input has an 8, then all rows above in the output have 8s in those positions. But Example 0's input row4 has 8s in the first six columns, but the output's row0 (which is above) has all 8s, which might support this. But Example1's input has 1s in certain positions, and the output's rows above also have 1s. For example, input row0 in Example1 has 1s at positions4 and7, and output row0 has 1s there plus another at position1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: in all three examples, the output has the original non-zero numbers in specific positions, and 5s elsewhere. The pattern of 5s and the original numbers seems to form a diagonal or staggered pattern. For Example0, it's a right-leaning diagonal of 5s; for Example1, it's vertical and horizontal lines; for Example2, alternating 5 and 2 in some rows.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is generated by taking each non-zero element in the input and creating a vertical line upwards from that position in the output, replacing 0s with 5s. For example, in Example0's input, the 8s in lower rows would create vertical lines in the output, filling the columns with 8s and replacing other positions with 5s. But in Example0's output, the first row is all 8s, which would require that every column has at least one 8 in the input's lower rows. The input's column0 has 8s in rows4,6,8. So in the output, column0 is filled with 8s in all rows above. That's possible. Let's check:\n\nIf in Example0's input, column0 has 8s in rows4,6,8, then in the output's column0, all rows from 0 to 8 would have 8s, but the output's column0 has 8s in row0, 2,4,6,8, and 5s in others. That doesn't fit. So this theory might not be correct.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by moving upwards through each column and when a non-zero is encountered, all rows above in that column are filled with the same number, and 5s otherwise. For example, in Example0's input, column0 has 8s in rows4,6,8. The earliest non-zero in column0 is row4. So in the output, column0 would have 8s from row0 down to row4, and then 5s below. But looking at Example0's output column0:\n\nRow0:8\n\nRow1:5\n\nRow2:8\n\nRow3:5\n\nRow4:8\n\nRow5:5\n\nRow6:8\n\nRow7:5\n\nRow8:8\n\nRow9:5\n\nSo it alternates 8 and5. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by a pattern that for each row, the number of original numbers decreases from the top, but that's vague.\n\nWait, perhaps the output's pattern is unrelated to the input's non-zero positions and is a fixed pattern based on the non-zero value. For example, in Example0, the non-zero is 8, so the output alternates 8 and5 in a specific pattern. Similarly, in Example1, non-zero is 1, so alternates 1 and5. But Example2 has non-zero 2 and alternates 2 and5. \n\nLooking at Example0's output, each row starts with a certain number of 8s followed by 5 and8 alternating. The number of 8s in each row decreases by two every two rows? Let's see:\n\nRow0:10 8s.\n\nRow1: 9 5s then 1 8.\n\nRow2: 8 8s, then 5,8.\n\nRow3:7 5s, then 8,5,8.\n\nWait, no. The pattern seems to be that each row has one less 8 from the left compared to the row above, but alternating between 5 and 8. For example:\n\nRow0: all 8s.\n\nRow1: all 5s except last is 8.\n\nRow2: starts with 8s up to position8, then 5, then 8.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is generated by a right-to-left, top-to-bottom filling pattern where each row starts with the original number, then alternates with 5s, but shifted by the row index.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a diagonal matrix where each diagonal element is the original number and the rest are 5s. But in Example0's output, the diagonal isn't aligned that way.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the output as a series of stripes. In Example0, the stripes are diagonals of 8 and5. For the test input, which has 4s, the output would have stripes of 4 and5 in a similar diagonal pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's output, the 8s are positioned such that each row has one less 8 on the left, creating a diagonal from top-left to bottom-right. But the exact pattern is more complex. For example, row0: all 8s; row1: all 5s except last is 8; row2: 8s up to position8, then 5,8; row3: 5s up to position7, then 8,5,8; and so on. It's like a checkerboard pattern that shifts right as you go down.\n\nBut how to apply this to the test input. The test input's non-zero is4. So the output should alternate 4 and5 in a similar diagonal pattern. \n\nIn Example0's output, the first row is all 8s. For the test input, the output's first row would be all4s. Then each subsequent row would introduce 5s starting from the left, creating a diagonal pattern. Let's see:\n\nTest Input's first row has six 4s followed by four 0s. The output's first row might be all4s. Then each row below would have one less4 from the left, replaced with5s, and the rightmost element always4. For example:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,4]\n\nRow2: [4,4,4,4,5,4,5,5,5,4]\n\nWait, but this doesn't match the training examples' pattern. Looking back at Example0's output, after the first row of all 8s, the next row has all 5s except last is8. Then the third row is all8s except position8 is5 and last is8. It's alternating between rows starting with 5 and 8.\n\nAlternatively, each even-indexed row (0,2,4...) starts with the original number, and odd rows start with5. For Example0:\n\nRow0: all8 (even).\n\nRow1: starts with5.\n\nRow2: starts with8.\n\nRow3: starts with5.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn this case, the pattern for each row alternates between starting with the original number and5, with the rest following an alternating pattern. For example, row0: all8. Row1: 5s then8. Row2: 8s up to position8, then5,8. Row3: 5s up to position7, then8,5,8. Etc.\n\nApplying this to the test input's non-zero number (4):\n\nThe first row would be all4s.\n\nRow0: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,4]\n\nRow2: [4,4,4,4,5,4,5,5,5,4]\n\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,4]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' pattern. For example, in Example0's row1, the last element is8, others are5. The test's row1 would have last element4, others5 except position5.\n\nBut in the test input's row1, there's a4 at position5. So perhaps the output row1 has 5s except position5 is4 and the last element is4. Like [5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,4]. But how does this fit with the training examples?\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows are constructed such that for each row, the original non-zero elements are preserved, and the rest are filled with5s in a way that creates a right-aligned pattern. For example, in Example0's output, each row's rightmost elements are 8s, and moving left, they alternate with5s.\n\nFor the test input, which has4s in certain positions, the output would preserve those4s and fill with5s in a right-aligned pattern.\n\nBut in Example0's input, the output's first row is all8s, even though the input's first row is all0s. This suggests that the output isn't directly based on the input's rows, but rather on some cumulative property.\n\nAnother possible pattern is that the output is a right-to-left, top-to-bottom flood fill. Starting from the top-right corner, fill with the original number, then alternate with5s as you move left. But Example0's output starts with all8s, which might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the maximum value from the current row down to the bottom of the input for each column. For example, if any row in the input's column from the current row downward has a non-zero, the output's current row's column is that non-zero. Otherwise, it's5. But let's check:\n\nFor Example0's input column0:\n\nRows0-3:0, row4:8, rows6:8, row8:8.\n\nSo for output row0, column0: since there's an8 in row4 below, the output would be8. Which matches Example0's output row0.\n\nRow1, column0: rows1-9, there's an8 in row4, so output is8. But in Example0's output row1, column0 is5. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe the output is the result of a cellular automaton where each cell becomes the original number if it's non-zero, otherwise it's5 if there's a non-zero to the right or below in the input. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the input and a checkerboard pattern of 5 and the original number. For example, in Example0, the checkerboard starts with8, then5, then8, etc., but modified based on the input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by a wave pattern starting from the right. For example, each row starts with the original number, then5, then the original number, etc., but shifted by the row index. This could create a diagonal pattern.\n\nFor the test input, if the output's first row is all4s, then each subsequent row has a5 replacing a4 from the left, similar to Example0's output. So:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,4] \u2013 no, wait, in Example0's row1, the last element is8, others are5. So for the test input's row1, it would be [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4].\n\nBut in Example0's row2: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8], which is 8s up to index8, then5,8. So for the test input's row2, it would be [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4].\n\nBut how does this relate to the input's structure? For Example0's input, the output's first row is all8s even though the input's first row has no 8s. So the output's pattern might not depend directly on the input's non-zero positions but is a standard pattern based on the presence of non-zeros somewhere in the input.\n\nIn the training examples, the output's first row is all the non-zero number (8,1,2) followed by a pattern. For Example2's output, the first row is [5,2,5,2,\u2026], which alternates5 and2. This seems different from Example0 and Example1.\n\nWait, in Example2's input, the first row has 2s at positions1,3,5,7. The output's first row is [5,2,5,2,\u2026], alternating5 and2 starting with5. So the original 2s are kept, and the 0s are replaced with5, but in a alternating pattern. But why?\n\nExample2's input has 2s in columns1,3,5,7 in the first row, and the output's first row has 2s in the same positions but also adds a 2 at position9. Hmm.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Let's try to find a rule that works for all examples.\n\nIn Example0's input, the output starts with all8s. Example1's output starts with5,1,5,5,1,\u2026 Example2's output starts with5,2,5,2,\u2026 So there's no consistent first row pattern. However, the original non-zero numbers are present in their positions in the output.\n\nWait, in Example1's input, row0 has 1s at positions4 and7. The output's row0 has 1s at positions1,4,7. So there's a new 1 at position1. How does that happen?\n\nAnother possibility is that the output is generated by treating each non-zero in the input as a seed and then growing them upwards and to the left, replacing 0s with5s. For Example1's input, the 1s in positions4 and7 (row0) might extend leftwards in the output. But row0's output has a1 at position1. Maybe there's a rule that every third position is filled with the non-zero number.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a combination of the input's non-zero positions and a vertical/horizontal expansion. For instance, in Example0's input, the 8s form a shape that's expanded to the top and right in the output, creating layers of 5s and8s.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the output's numbers. In all examples, the output uses two numbers: the original non-zero and 5. The 5s seem to be replacing zeros, but not in all cases. For instance, in Example0's output, the first row is all8s, which are not present in the input's first row. So the 8s are being generated where there were none.\n\nPerhaps the output is a result of the input being processed in a way that each non-zero cell in the input generates a vertical and horizontal line in the output, and the intersection of these lines creates a grid of the original number and 5s. For example, each 8 in Example0's input generates a vertical and horizontal line, and where they overlap, 8s are placed, otherwise 5s.\n\nBut this would require that the output's cells are 8s wherever there's a line from any input 8, and 5s otherwise. But in Example0's output, the first row is all8s, which would imply that all columns have a vertical line from some input 8. Looking at the input's columns in Example0: columns0-5 have 8s in multiple rows. So their vertical lines would fill those columns with8s. But columns6-9 have no 8s, so their vertical lines would be 5s. But the output's first row has all8s. So this theory isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a bitwise OR of all rows below in the input. For example, for each cell in the output, it's the OR of all cells in the same column from that row down. In Example0's input, column0 has 8s in rows4,6,8. So the OR for row0 would be8. Hence, output row0, column0 is8. This fits. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example1's input, column0 has all zeros. So the OR for any row in column0 would be0, but the output uses5 instead. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the input's cumulative maximum from the bottom up. For each cell, if any cell in the same column from the current row down is non-zero, the output is that number; otherwise, it's5. Let's check.\n\nFor Example0's input, column0:\n\nRows0-3:0, row4:8, row6:8, row8:8. So the cumulative maximum from the bottom up for row0 would be8 (since rows below have8). So output row0, column0 is8. This matches. For row1, same column0: the maximum from row1 down is8. So output row1, column0 is8. But in Example0's output, row1's column0 is5. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nThis is frustrating. Let's try to find a different angle. Maybe the output is generated by the following steps:\n\n1. Replace all zeros in the input with5.\n2. For each non-zero in the input, create a right-aligned block starting from that position and extending to the end of the row, replacing 5s with the original number.\n\nFor example, in Example0's input row4: [8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]. Replacing zeros with5 gives [8,8,8,8,8,8,5,5,5,5]. Then create a right-aligned block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each row in the input, starting from the first non-zero element, replace all elements to the right with the original number. For Example0's input row4, first six elements are8, then zeros. Replacing zeros to the right with8 would make [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. But the output's row4 is [8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8]. So this isn't matching.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output's structure and see if it's a known pattern. For Example0's output, the pattern resembles a right-justified triangle of 8s with 5s filling in from the left as you go down each row. The number of 8s in each row decreases by one as you go down, but alternating between 5 and8.\n\nAlternatively, each row in the output has a number of 8s equal to 10 minus the row index. For Example0's row0, 10-0=10 8s. Row1:9, but it's 9 5s and1 8. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s in each row decreases by one as you go down. For Example0:\n\nRow0:10 8s.\n\nRow1:1 8.\n\nRow2:8 8s.\n\nRow3:2 8s.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to think of the test input and what its output might look like based on the examples.\n\nThe test input's non-zero is4. The pattern in the training examples for the output seems to be alternating between the non-zero number and5 in a diagonal pattern. For Example0, the output starts with all8s and each subsequent row has a5 replacing an8 from the left. Similarly, the test input's output should start with all4s, then each row has 5s replacing from the left.\n\nSo the test output's row0 would be [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4].\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,4].\n\nRow2: [5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,4].\n\nBut wait, in Example0's output, the second row (row1) is all5s except last is8. The third row (row2) is eight 8s followed by5 and8.\n\nFor the test input's row2, which in input is all0s except a4 at position5. Following Example0's pattern, the output's row2 would be [5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,4]. But Example0's row2 is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8]. So for test input row2, perhaps it's [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4].\n\nBut this is guesswork. Another way is to see that in Example0's input, the non-zero rows form a kind of 'staircase' going down and left. The output's pattern is a staircase of 5s coming from the left as you go down. So for the test input, which has a similar staircase but with4s, the output would have a similar staircase of5s.\n\nLooking at the test input's structure:\n\nRows0 and9 have six4s followed by four0s.\n\nRows3 and6 have three4s followed by zeros.\n\nRows4,5 have a single4 in position2.\n\nRow7,8 have a single4 in position5.\n\nRows1,2 have a single4 in position5.\n\nSo the input's 4s form a sort of hourglass shape. The output should create a pattern where each row has a decreasing number of4s from the left, replaced by5s, similar to Example0's output.\n\nSo the output's first row would be all4s. Each subsequent row would have one fewer4 from the left, replaced by5s, but the rightmost element remains4. However, the exact pattern might alternate between4 and5.\n\nAlternatively, the output for the test input would follow the same pattern as Example0's output, but with4 instead of8. So the rows would alternate between starting with4 and5, creating a diagonal pattern.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4]\n\nRow2: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4]\n\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,4]\n\nRow4: [4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,5,4]\n\nRow5: [5,5,5,5,5,4,5,4,5,4]\n\nRow6: [4,4,4,4,5,4,5,4,5,4]\n\nRow7: [5,5,5,4,5,4,5,4,5,4]\n\nRow8: [4,4,5,4,5,4,5,4,5,4]\n\nRow9: [5,5,5,4,5,4,5,4,5,4]\n\nWait, but the test input's row9 is [4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0]. So in the output, row9 would follow the pattern. However, looking at Example0's output, the last row (row9) is [5,8,5,8,5,8,5,8,5,8]. So each position alternates5 and8. For the test input's last row, it would alternate5 and4. But the test input's row9 has six4s followed by four0s. Following the pattern, row9's output would be [5,4,5,4,5,4,5,4,5,4].\n\nBut I need to ensure this matches the training examples' pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output's last row alternates between5 and the original number, starting with5. For Example0, row9 is [5,8,5,8,\u2026]. For Example1, the last row is all5s. For Example2, the last row is all2s. So the pattern varies. This suggests that the output's last row depends on the input's structure.\n\nThis is really tricky. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to hypothesize that the output is generated by creating a diagonal pattern where each row has the original number and5s alternating, starting from the right, with each row's pattern shifted left by one. \n\nFor the test input, this would mean:\n\nRow0: All4s.\n\nRow1: All5s except last element4.\n\nRow2: All4s except the ninth position5 and last4.\n\nRow3: All5s except eighth and last positions4.\n\nAnd so on. This would create a diagonal of5s moving left each row.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4]\n\nRow2: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4]\n\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,4]\n\nRow4: [5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,4,4]\n\nRow5: [5,5,5,5,5,4,5,4,5,4]\n\nRow6: [5,5,5,5,4,5,4,5,4,4]\n\nRow7: [5,5,5,4,5,4,5,4,5,4]\n\nRow8: [5,5,4,5,4,5,4,5,4,4]\n\nRow9: [5,4,5,4,5,4,5,4,5,4]\n\nBut this doesn't exactly match the training examples' structure. For example, in Example0's row9, it's [5,8,5,8,\u2026], which alternates5 and8. This test output's row9 would alternate5 and4, which fits.\n\nHowever, comparing with the test input's structure, which has 4s in certain positions, the output's pattern might need to adjust. For instance, in the test input's row0 and row9 have six4s, but the output's row0 is all4s. The other rows would follow the diagonal pattern.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer would follow this pattern with4 and5, similar to Example0's output but with4.",
