        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to take the input grids and transform them into the output grids based on the examples provided. Let me look at the training examples first to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 24x19 grid, and the output is a 17x9 grid. Hmm, so the output is smaller. Let me check the dimensions. The input has varying row lengths, but the output rows are all 9 elements long. So maybe there's some kind of cropping or selecting a specific region from the input.\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output. The input starts with a lot of zeros (which I assume are borders) and then some numbers like 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8. The output has numbers like 2, 4, 3, 8, etc. Maybe the output is focusing on a central area of the input where the non-zero numbers are. Let me see the positions. The output in Example 0 has 17 rows, which might correspond to the middle 17 rows of the input. Wait, the input for Example 0 has 24 rows, but the output is 17. That's a reduction of 7 rows. Hmm. Maybe it's trimming the borders. Let's check if the input rows start and end with zeros. Yes, the first and last rows are all zeros. So perhaps the output is the input without the first and last few rows and columns. But in Example 0, the output has 9 columns. The input has 19 columns. So maybe trimming 5 columns from each side (since 19-10=9, but 19-10=9, wait 19-2*5=9). Let me check. For example, in the first input row of Example 0, [0,0,...0], the output starts with [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]. Looking at the input's second row: [0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. If we remove the first two zeros and the last 8 zeros, we get the middle 9 elements: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2. That matches the first output row. So maybe the pattern is to remove the first two columns and the last 8 columns (since 19-2-8=9). Wait, but 2+8=10, 19-10=9. So for columns, take from index 2 to 10 (inclusive), which is 9 elements. Let's check another row. The third input row in Example 0 is [0,0,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,2,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,0]. Taking columns 2 to 10 (indices 2 to 10 inclusive, which is 9 elements): 2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,2. But the output for the third row in Example 0 is [2,2,2,4,2,2,3,2,3]. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, so maybe not a simple cropping. Alternatively, maybe the processing is more involved, like considering non-zero regions or some transformation based on neighboring cells.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is generated by taking the central part of the input where the non-zero numbers are, and then applying some transformation. Let's look at another example. Example 1's input is 20 rows of 10 elements each. The output is 8 rows of 8 elements each. So again, the output is smaller. Let's see the first input row is all zeros, the second row starts with 0, then 2s. The first output row is [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2], which would correspond to the second row of the input, excluding the first and last zeros. So for columns 1 to 8 (since input has 10 columns, output has 8). So maybe trimming the first and last column. For rows, perhaps trimming the first and last rows. But in Example 1, the output has 8 rows, and the input has 20. So maybe the output is rows 1 to 8 (the first 8 non-border rows)? Let me check. The input has rows starting from 0 to 19. The output is 8 rows. Let's see: the input's second row (index 1) is [0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0], which would become [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2] in the output. That matches the first output row. Then the third input row is [0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0], which would become [2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2], but the output's second row is [2,4,2,4,2,2,2,2]. So that doesn't match directly. So maybe there's more to it than just trimming borders. Maybe some transformation based on the surrounding cells.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output. The first output row is all 2s, which matches the input's second row's middle 9 elements. But in some rows, like the third output row in Example 0, there's a 4. Let's check the input's third row: [0,0,2,0,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]. The middle 9 elements (columns 2-10) would be 2,0,0,2,2,2,2,0,2. But the output row is [2,2,2,4,2,2,3,2,3]. So clearly, there's a transformation here. The input's 2s might be transformed based on their neighbors. For instance, if a cell is a 2 and surrounded by other 2s, it stays 2. But if it's a 2 with certain other numbers nearby, it becomes a 4, 3, etc. Or perhaps the numbers in the output represent counts or some other relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a kind of edge detection or highlighting the borders of regions. For example, in Example 0's input, there's a region of 2s, and in the output, the edges of that region are marked with higher numbers like 4 or 3. Let's check. The third output row in Example 0 has a 4 in the fourth position. Looking at the input's third row's middle columns: the third element is 0, but maybe the 4 comes from the surrounding cells. Alternatively, perhaps the output is a convolution where each cell is the sum or some combination of neighboring cells in the input. For example, each output cell could be the sum of the 3x3 grid around the corresponding input cell. But the numbers in the output are higher (like 4, 8, etc.), so maybe it's the count of non-zero neighbors. Let's test that.\n\nTake Example 0's input row 2, column 2 (which is 2). The 3x3 neighbors around it would be the cells above, below, left, right, and diagonals. Let's see: input row 2 is [0,0,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,2,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,0]. The cell at position (row 2, column 2) is 2. The neighbors would be the cells around it. But perhaps the output is not a direct count but a code based on the pattern of neighbors. Alternatively, maybe the output represents the number of adjacent non-zero cells. For example, if a 2 in the input has 4 non-zero neighbors, it becomes 4. But in Example 0's output, there's a 4 in the third row. Let's check.\n\nWait, let's take the third output row of Example 0: [2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]. Let's see the corresponding input row. The input row is index 3 (since the output rows start from input row 2 maybe). The input row 3 is [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]. The middle 9 columns (2-10) are [2,0,0,2,2,2,2,0,2]. But the output row is [2,2,2,4,2,2,3,2,3]. So the fourth element in output is 4, which corresponds to input's fifth column (index 4). The input cell at row 3, column 4 is 0. Wait, that's confusing. So maybe the output isn't directly taking the middle columns but something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformed version where each cell is determined by the presence of certain numbers in a specific pattern around it. For example, if a cell in the input is a 2 and has a 0 adjacent to it, it becomes a higher number. Let me check. Take the third output row in Example 0 where there's a 4. The input's corresponding cell (row 3, column 5) is 2. Let's look at its neighbors. The input row 3 is [0,0,2,0,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]. Let's take column 5 (0-based index 4): the cell is 0. Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up rows and columns here. Maybe the output corresponds to the input's non-zero regions, but with transformations based on neighboring cells. Alternatively, maybe the output is a kernel applied to the input. For example, each output cell is a sum of the input cell and its neighbors, modulo some value. But the numbers in the output are higher, like 4, 8, so perhaps multiplication or addition.\n\nAnother approach: look for the output numbers and see where they appear in the input. For instance, in Example 0's output, the number 4 appears. In the input of Example 0, there are some 4s in the later rows. For example, the 21st input row is [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Maybe the output is combining these numbers. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the maximum value in a certain area of the input. For example, each output cell is the maximum of a 3x3 grid in the input. Let's check. Take the first output row of Example 0: all 2s. The corresponding input rows are rows 1 and 2. But the input's second row (index 1) has 2s in the middle, so the max would be 2. That works. The third output row has a 4. Let's see which part of the input has a 4. Looking at the input rows, the 21st row has 4s. But that's much later. So maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a compressed version of the input, where each output cell represents a cluster of input cells. For example, each 3x3 block in the input is averaged or summed to form the output. But given that the output numbers are integers, maybe it's the sum or some other aggregation. For example, in Example 0's input, the output row 3 has a 4. If the corresponding 3x3 block in the input has a total sum of 4*9=36? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the maximum value in the block. Let's check.\n\nTake the third output row's fourth element, which is 4. If the corresponding 3x3 block in the input has a maximum of 4, but looking at the input, the 4s appear in later rows. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the count of a certain number in the input's surrounding cells. For example, the number of times a 0 appears around a 2. But how would that lead to numbers like 4 or 8?\n\nAnother angle: looking at the test input. The test input has rows with 0s and numbers like 2,1,3,4,8. Let's see if the output pattern can be determined by looking for the same transformations as in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the central part of the input (removing borders) and then applying a transformation where each cell's value is determined by the number of adjacent cells that are different. For instance, if a cell is a 2 and has two adjacent 0s, it becomes a 3, etc. But this is speculative.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input and output. The output has 17 rows. The input has 24 rows. Let's see the input rows that correspond to the output. The first output row is [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2], which matches the second input row's middle 9 elements. Then the second output row is [2,2,4,4,2,2,3,2,3]. The third input row's middle 9 elements are [2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,2]. How does that become the second output row? Maybe each 2 in the input becomes a 4 if it's adjacent to a 0. For example, in the third input row, the third element is 0, but the output's third element is 4. Wait, that might not align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of some cellular automaton step. For example, applying a rule to each cell based on its neighbors. But without knowing the exact rule, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother thought: the output's dimensions. In Example 0, the input is 24 rows by 19 columns, output is 17 rows by 9 columns. Example 1: input is 20x10, output is 8x8. Example 2: input is 16x12, output is 9x9. So there's no consistent size reduction ratio. This suggests that the output is not a simple crop but depends on the content.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the largest connected region of 2s in the input, transformed somehow. But in Example 0's input, there's a lot of 2s, and the output also has 2s, but with other numbers. Hmm.\n\nLet me look at Example 2's input and output. The input has some 8s and 2s. The output has 8s in specific positions. For example, the third output row is [2,2,8,2,8,2,2,2,2]. Looking at the input's second row: [0,0,0,0,0,8,2,8,0,0,0,0]. So those 8s in the input might correspond to the 8s in the output. But how? The output row is in the third position, which might correspond to the input's row where the 8s are. So perhaps the output is capturing certain features from the input, like islands of numbers other than 2 and 0.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a combination of different layers. For instance, the numbers in the output represent different regions or layers from the input. For example, 2s are the main body, and 4s, 3s, 8s, etc., are overlays from other regions in the input.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, towards the bottom, there are rows with 4s and 5s, and in the output, there's a row [8,2,2,2,2,5,2,5,2]. So maybe the output is combining multiple regions from the input. The 8 and 5 in the output could be coming from the lower part of the input where 8 and 5 are present.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by taking the first occurrence of non-zero numbers in each column, stacking them. But that seems unlikely given the examples.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern in how the numbers change. For example, in Example 0's output row 14: [8,8,2,2,2,5,2,5,2]. The input's row 18 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0]. The middle 9 elements would be 0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0. But the output has 8,8,2... So maybe it's combining multiple layers. Alternatively, the output's 8s come from where there are 8s in the input, but merged with the 2s from other layers.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is the sum of the input's layers. For example, each position in the output is the sum of all the numbers in that position across all layers (rows) of the input. But the input is a 2D grid, not 3D, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe each output row is a transformation of a specific input row. For example, output row n corresponds to input row m, but with some operation. But how to determine m.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the result of a maze-like pathfinding, where the numbers represent steps or directions, but that seems complicated.\n\nLooking back at the test input. The test input has rows with 2s, 1s, 3s, 4s, and 8s. For example, in the last few rows of the test input, there are 8s and 4s. So perhaps the output will include those numbers where they appear in the input, combined with the main 2s structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a condensed version where each cell is the sum of all the numbers in that column for a certain set of rows. But again, not sure.\n\nLet me think about the Test Input. The test input has 19 rows. Let's count them:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: starts and ends with 0, with 2s in between.\n\nRow 2: has 0s in positions 3 and 4 (0-based?), and more 2s.\n\nRows 3-6: similar, with some 0s inside.\n\nRow 7: has 0s towards the end.\n\nRow 8: all 2s except zeros.\n\nRow 9: all zeros.\n\nRow 10: all zeros.\n\nRow 11: has 1s, 3s.\n\nRow 12: 1,2,1 and 3s.\n\nRow 13: similar to row 11.\n\nRow 14: all zeros.\n\nRow 15: ends with 8,8,2.\n\nRow 16: has 4s and 2s.\n\nRow 17: has 4s, 2s, and 8.\n\nRow 18: 4s and 2s, ends with zeros.\n\nSo the output for the test input should capture the main 2s structure and any other numbers like 4s, 8s, 1s, 3s. Looking at the training examples, the output seems to merge these numbers into the main 2s grid where they appear in the input.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the last few rows include 8s, which correspond to the input's rows 17-19 where 8s appear. So perhaps the output is combining the non-zero numbers from different parts of the input into a single grid. For example, taking the main 2s structure and overlaying other numbers where they appear in the input.\n\nBut how are the positions aligned? For instance, in Example 0's input, the 8s are in the lower rows, columns 14-16. In the output, those 8s appear in rows 13-15 of the output. So perhaps the output is a composite of different regions, each taken from their respective positions in the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a vertical slice. For example, taking columns 5-13 (for Example 0's input of 19 columns) to make 9 columns. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, each output row corresponds to a specific input row, but with some transformation. For example, the first output row is the second input row's middle 9 elements. The second output row is the third input row's middle 9 elements, but with some transformation applied.\n\nBut in Example 0's output row 1: [2,2,4,4,2,2,3,2,3]. The corresponding input row (row 2) is [0,0,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,2,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,0]. The middle 9 elements are 2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,2. So how does this become 2,2,4,4,2,2,3,2,3?\n\nWait, maybe each element in the output is the count of non-zero neighbors in the input. Let's take the third element in output row 1, which is 4. The corresponding input cell is 0 (from row 2, column 4). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the cell in the output corresponds to the input cell's value plus some function of its neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell is the sum of the cell's value and the number of adjacent non-zero cells. For example, if a cell is 2 and has 2 neighbors, it becomes 4. But that would require the input cell to be 2 and have 2 neighbors. Let's check.\n\nTake the third element in output row 1 of Example 0: 4. The input cell is 0 (row 2, column 4). That can't be. Alternatively, maybe the output cell is the sum of the neighboring cells. If the input cell is 0 but surrounded by four 2s, then 2*4=8, but the output is 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a convolution with a specific kernel. For example, edge detection using a kernel like Sobel. But without knowing the exact kernel, it's hard to replicate.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the numbers in the output. The numbers are 2,3,4,5,8. In the training examples, these numbers appear in the input as well. So maybe the output is a composite where each cell takes the highest number present in that cell's position across all layers (rows) of the input. Wait, but the input is a single 2D grid, not multiple layers. Unless the input rows are processed as different layers. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the maximum value found in each cell's column across all rows. For example, if in column 5 of the input, the maximum value is 8, then the output's column 5 would have 8. But looking at Example 0's output, this doesn't hold. The first output row has all 2s, but the input's column 5 (middle columns) might have higher numbers later.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for another pattern. Let's think about the positions where the non-2 numbers appear in the output. For example, in Example 0's output, the first non-2 numbers are in row 2, column 3 and 4 (4s). Looking at the input, perhaps those correspond to regions where there are other numbers. For instance, in the input's rows below, there are 1s and 3s. But how do they contribute to the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a kind of maze where different numbers represent different types of walls or paths, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output could be a run-length encoding of the input's rows. For example, the number of consecutive 2s. But the output numbers are not consistent with that.\n\nWait, let's look at the test input's structure. The main body is a 2s structure with some holes (0s) and other numbers (1,3,4,8). The output likely captures the main 2s structure and overlays the other numbers where they appear in the input. For instance, in the test input's row 15, there's 8,8,2. Maybe in the output, these 8s appear in the corresponding position.\n\nAnother approach: the output is the input's central area, but with certain transformations applied. For example, replacing 0s with 2s if they are surrounded by 2s, but that doesn't explain the higher numbers.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a reflection of the input. For example, flipping the input horizontally or vertically. But the examples don't show a clear reflection.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the numbers 4 and 3 appear. In the input, the number 4 appears in rows 20-22. For example, row 21: [0,0,0,4,2,4,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The middle 9 elements here are 0,4,2,4,0,0,2,2,2. The corresponding output row might be somewhere in the output. Looking at Example 0's output, row 13 is [8,2,2,2,2,5,2,5,2]. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output is generated by scanning the input from top to bottom and left to right, and whenever a number other than 0 or 2 is encountered, it's placed in the output at the corresponding position, otherwise, it's a 2. But in Example 0's output, there are 4s and 3s where the input has 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of different features in the input. For example, each number in the output represents a different feature detected in the input, like corners, edges, etc., with different codes. But without knowing the coding scheme, it's hard to deduce.\n\nMaybe I should look for a pattern in how the numbers in the output relate to the input's structure. For example, in Example 0's output, the 4s and 3s might correspond to junctions or intersections in the 2s regions. Like, a 4 could be a crossroad, and a 3 a T-junction. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 3, the fourth column (0-based) is 0. Around it, there might be 2s. If this is a junction, perhaps the output marks it with a 4. But how.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers represent the number of exits or paths from each cell. For example, a cell with four exits (up, down, left, right) becomes 4. But this is speculative.\n\nLet's try to apply this to Example 0's input row 2, which is [0,0,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,2,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,0]. The middle 9 elements are 2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,2. The corresponding output row is [2,2,4,4,2,2,3,2,3]. The third and fourth elements are 4 and 4. If the input's third and fourth elements are 0 and 2, respectively, perhaps the output is counting the number of adjacent non-zero cells. For example, for the third element (0 in input), the neighbors might be 2, 0, 2, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output numbers are the sum of the cell's value and the number of adjacent cells that are not 2. For example, a 0 with two neighboring 2s would become 0 + 2 = 2. But this doesn't explain higher numbers like 4.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a map where each number represents a different type of cell in the input's structure. For example, 2 for normal path, 4 for intersections, 3 for turns, 8 for dead-ends. This is possible but requires checking.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output row 7: [2,2,2,1,2,1,2,2,2]. The input row 7 is [0,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0]. The middle 9 elements are 2,2,2,0,2,2,2,0,0. The output has 1s where there are 0s in the input. Maybe the 1s in the output correspond to the 0s (holes) in the input. But why 1s and not other numbers?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a mirror image. For example, the output is the input flipped. But the output rows in Example 0 don't match flipped input rows.\n\nAt this point, I'm not making progress. Let me try to hypothesize based on the test input. The test input's main structure is a central block of 2s with some internal 0s. At the bottom, there are some 8s, 4s, and 3s. The output probably needs to capture the main 2s structure and include the other numbers where they appear. The training examples' outputs often start with several rows of 2s, then some rows with 4s, 3s, 8s, etc.\n\nFor the test input, the output may start with rows of 2s, then include the 1s from rows 11-13, and the 8s and 4s from the lower rows. The output's dimensions would likely be the same as the number of non-zero rows in the input, trimmed of zeros.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking the central part of the input (removing borders of zeros) and then applying a transformation where cells with certain patterns (like adjacent 0s) become higher numbers.\n\nAnother possible pattern is that the output is a rotated or transposed version of the input. For example, the output rows are the input's columns. But checking Example 0, the output has 9 columns, while the input has 19 rows. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a diagonal slice of the input. Unlikely.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll proceed with an educated guess based on the first example's transformation: the output is the middle section of the input (removing borders) and replacing 0s with 2s, but when a 0 is surrounded by other numbers, those numbers are placed in the output. For example, in Example 0's input, the 0s inside the 2s regions become 4s or 3s, possibly based on the neighboring cells.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking each row of the input, removing the leading and trailing zeros, and then padding or truncating to a fixed length (like 9 columns), replacing any zeros in between with 2s. But this doesn't explain the presence of other numbers like 4 and 8.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the output is the central part of the input (after removing zeros on the edges) and any non-zero numbers (other than 2) are preserved, while zeros are replaced with 2s. But in the examples, this isn't exactly the case. For example, in Example 0's input row 3, there's a 0 in the middle that becomes 4 in the output. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother last-ditch effort: perhaps the output is the result of applying a maze-solving algorithm, where the numbers represent steps or directions. But without knowing the algorithm, it's impossible to replicate.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I think the most plausible answer is that the output is a cropped version of the input, removing the border zeros and possibly some transformation like replacing 0s with 2s, but with higher numbers coming from specific patterns in the input. For the test input, I'll need to crop the central part, trim the zeros on the edges, and replace any internal zeros with 2s, while preserving other numbers like 1,3,4,8 where they appear.\n\nLooking at the test input, the first non-zero rows start from row 1 to row 8. The columns with non-zeros are from index 2 to 13 (since each row starts with two zeros and ends with a zero). So the middle 12 columns (2-13) would be 12 elements, but the output examples have 9 columns. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, for the test input, each row has 15 elements. The non-zero elements are from index 2 to 13 (inclusive), which is 12 elements. But the output examples have varying column counts, like 9, 8, 9. So perhaps trimming to 9 columns by taking columns 3 to 11 (0-based), which would give 9 elements.\n\nFor example, the first non-zero row in the test input is row 1: [0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0]. Trimming the first two zeros and the last two zeros (indices 0-1 and 13-14), we get 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2. But that's 12 elements, which doesn't fit the output's 9 columns. So maybe there's a different trimming. Alternatively, take columns 2 to 10 (inclusive), which are 9 elements. For row 1: indices 2-10: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2. Which matches the first output row. Similarly, row 2: [0,0,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,0]. Columns 2-10: 2,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,2. If zeros are replaced with 2, that would become 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2, but the output may have other numbers. But this is a guess.\n\nHowever, looking at Example 0's input, the output includes non-2 numbers where there are other numbers in the input. For example, the output has 8s corresponding to input's lower rows with 8s. So perhaps the output is constructed by overlaying all non-zero numbers (excluding 2) onto a base of 2s, where the base is the main structure.\n\nGiven this, for the test input's output, the rows corresponding to the main 2s structure (rows 1-8) would be all 2s, except where there are 0s inside, which might be replaced with other numbers. The lower rows (11-13) have 1s and 3s, and rows 15-17 have 8s and 4s. These would be overlaid into the output.\n\nBut without knowing the exact transformation, it's hard to proceed. Given the time constraints, I'll make an educated guess that the output is the central part of the input (trimming borders of zeros), and any non-zero numbers other than 2 are preserved, while zeros are turned into 2s. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nThe first few rows (1-8) after trimming borders would be:\n\nRow 1: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 (trimmed to 9 columns?)\n\nRow 2: 2,0,2,2,2,0,2,2,2...\n\nBut perhaps the output rows are 9 columns wide. Let's take columns 2-10 (0-based) for each row. For row 1, columns 2-10: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 \u2192 output row 1: all 2s.\n\nRow 2: columns 2-10: 2,0,2,0,0,2,2,2,0 \u2192 but the output would replace 0s with 2s? But in the examples, zeros inside become other numbers. Hmm. This is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the input's non-zero numbers, with 2s as default. So wherever there's a non-zero number (including 2), it's taken. But the output includes numbers like 4 and 3, which come from later rows in the input.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the 8s come from the lower rows of the input. So perhaps the output is a vertical stack of non-zero regions from the input, regardless of their original row positions. For example, the main 2s structure is from the upper rows, and other numbers are added from lower rows where they appear.\n\nBut how to align them. For instance, in Example 0's output, the 8s are in the lower part of the output, corresponding to where they are in the input. So maybe the output is just the input's non-zero regions stacked vertically, with each region trimmed to 9 columns.\n\nIn the test input, the main 2s structure is in rows 1-8, then there are some 1s and 3s in rows 11-13, and 8s and 4s in rows 15-17. So the output would have rows from these regions, each trimmed to 9 columns.\n\nFor example, rows 1-8: trimmed to 9 columns, then rows 11-13, and rows 15-17. But the output's row count would be 8 + 3 + 3 = 14, which doesn't match the examples. This is unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed to create an output for the test input by taking the central 9 columns of each relevant row, replacing 0s with 2s, and including other numbers where they appear in the input. For example, rows 1-8 of the test input's central 9 columns would be 2s, rows 11-13 would have 1s and 3s, and rows 15-17 would have 8s and 4s. This matches the structure of the training examples, where higher numbers appear in the lower part of the output.\n\nSo, applying this:\n\nFirst few rows (from the main 2s structure):\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,0,2,2,2,0,2] \u2192 replace 0s with 2 \u2192 [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nWait, but in the training examples, some 0s become 4 or 3. Maybe I need to look for where in the input the 0s are surrounded by certain numbers. For example, if a 0 is between 2s, it becomes a 4. If a 0 is near a 1, it becomes a 3, etc. But without knowing the exact rule, I'll have to guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by overlaying all non-zero numbers from the input onto a base grid of 2s, replacing the 2s where other numbers appear. For example, in the test input, the 1s and 3s in rows 11-13 would overlay onto the 2s in those positions, and the 8s and 4s in rows 15-17 would similarly overlay.\n\nSo, the output would have:\n\n- Rows 1-8: mostly 2s, with some 0s turned into higher numbers based on neighboring cells (but not sure).\n\n- Rows 11-13: 1s and 3s.\n\n- Rows 15-17: 8s and 4s.\n\nBut the output's rows need to be a certain length. Given the examples, the output rows are 9 elements. So each row of the output corresponds to a specific row in the input, trimmed to 9 columns, with replacements based on other numbers in that row or others.\n\nIn the test input's rows 11-13, the middle 9 columns (columns 3-11, 0-based) are:\n\nRow 11: [1,1,1,0,0,0,2,3,3]\n\nRow 12: [1,2,1,0,0,0,2,2,3]\n\nRow 13: [1,1,1,0,0,0,2,3,3]\n\nSo these would become rows in the output with 1s and 3s.\n\nRows 15-17:\n\nRow 15: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,2,0] \u2192 middle 9 columns: 0,0,0,0,8,8,2 \u2192 but 9 columns? Let me see columns 6-14: 0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,2.\n\nRow 16: [0,0,0,4,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,0] \u2192 middle 9 columns: 4,2,4,0,0,0,8,2,2.\n\nRow 17: [0,0,0,4,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,8,0] \u2192 middle 9 columns: 4,2,4,0,0,0,2,2,8.\n\nRow 18: [0,0,0,4,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 middle 9 columns: 4,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nSo these rows would contribute to the output with 4s, 8s, 2s.\n\nPutting it all together, the output would have:\n\nRows from the main structure (rows 1-8 of input) \u2192 all 2s.\n\nRows from 11-13: [1,1,1,0,0,0,2,3,3] \u2192 but zeros might be replaced with 2s, resulting in [1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3], etc.\n\nRows from 15-17: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,2] \u2192 replaced zeros with 2s \u2192 [2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,2], and similarly for others.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the numbers like 8 appear as [8,2,2,2,2,5,2,5,2], which combines 8s with other numbers. So perhaps the output is combining all non-zero numbers from all rows, with 2s as the default. This would mean that for each position in the output, if any row in the input has a non-zero number there (other than 2), it takes the highest or latest one. For example, if in column x, row y of the input has a 8, then the output's column x would have 8.\n\nBut this is speculative. Given the time constraints, I'll generate the test output by taking the middle 9 columns of each relevant row, replacing 0s with 2s, and including other numbers as they are. For rows 11-13 and 15-17, the numbers like 1,3,4,8 would be preserved in their positions.\n\nApplying this:\n\nFor rows 1-8 of the test input:\n\nRow 1 (columns 2-10): [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow 2 (columns 2-10): [2,0,2,0,0,2,2,2,0] \u2192 replace 0s with 2 \u2192 [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow 3: [2,0,0,2,0,0,2,2,2] \u2192 replaced \u2192 [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow 4: [2,2,0,0,2,2,2,2,2] \u2192 replaced \u2192 [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nRows 5-7: similar, all 2s.\n\nRow 8: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nRows 11-13:\n\nRow 11: [1,1,1,0,0,0,2,3,3] \u2192 replaced 0s \u2192 [1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3]\n\nRow 12: [1,2,1,0,0,0,2,2,3] \u2192 replaced \u2192 [1,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,3]\n\nRow 13: [1,1,1,0,0,0,2,3,3] \u2192 replaced \u2192 [1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3]\n\nRows 15-17:\n\nRow 15: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,2] \u2192 replaced \u2192 [2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,2]\n\nRow 16: [4,2,4,0,0,0,8,2,2] \u2192 replaced \u2192 [4,2,4,2,2,2,8,2,2]\n\nRow 17: [4,2,4,0,0,0,2,2,8] \u2192 replaced \u2192 [4,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,8]\n\nRow 18: [4,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 replaced \u2192 [4,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nPutting all these rows together, the output would be:\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\n[1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3]\n\n[1,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,3]\n\n[1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3]\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,2]\n\n[4,2,4,2,2,2,8,2,2]\n\n[4,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,8]\n\n[4,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nBut this doesn't exactly match the structure of the training examples. For instance, in Example 0, the output includes numbers like 4 and 3 in the middle of the 2s. However, given the time, this is my best guess.",
