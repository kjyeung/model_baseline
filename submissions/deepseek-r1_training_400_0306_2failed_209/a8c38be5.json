        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of lists (rows) of numbers, and the output is another list of lists. The first thing I notice is that the output rows are shorter than the input rows. For example, in Example 0, the input has 14 elements per row, and the output has 9. Similarly, Example 1's input rows are 14 elements and output 9. The test input has 15 elements per row, so maybe the output will be shorter as well.\n\nLet me check the examples more closely. Let's take Example 0's input and output. The input has 14 columns, and the output 9. The test input has 15 columns, so maybe the output will have 10? Wait, no, the examples in the output have 9 elements. Wait, maybe it's not about the total length but some transformation.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. Let's take the first input row: [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output's first row is [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]. Hmm. How do these relate?\n\nWait, maybe each output row is combining elements from adjacent input rows. Let's see. The input has 14 rows (assuming each row is a vertical element), but wait, the input in Example 0 has 14 elements per row, and 14 rows. The output has 9 rows. Wait, no. Wait, in Example 0, the input is a list of 14 rows (each with 14 elements?), but no, looking at the problem statement, the input is given as a list of lists. Wait, the user's formatting might be a bit confusing. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, each input is a list of lists. For example, Example 0's input is a series of lists (each line is a list). The first line of Example 0's input is [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which has 14 elements. The output for Example 0 is a list of 9 lists, each with 9 elements. So perhaps the transformation is reducing the size from 14x14 to 9x9? But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid, but the examples have 9 rows, each with 9 elements. Wait, no. The output for Example 0 is 9 rows of 9 elements each. So maybe the input is a larger grid (like 14x14) and the output is a 9x9 grid. So the pattern is downscaling the grid by some method.\n\nLooking for how the numbers are transformed. Let's take the first output row of Example 0: [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]. Let's see where these numbers come from in the input. Let's look at the input rows. The input has 14 rows, each with 14 elements. So perhaps each output cell is derived from a 2x2 or 3x3 block in the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a center portion of the input. For example, if the input is 14x14, maybe the output is a 9x9 grid taken from the center. But checking the first input row of Example 0: the first three elements are 5,5,5, then followed by zeros. The output's first row starts with 6,6,5. That doesn't seem like a direct subset.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by applying some convolution or pattern detection. For example, each output cell is the sum or some combination of surrounding cells. But the numbers in the output don't seem to be sums. For example, in Example 0's first input row, the first three 5s. The output starts with 6,6,5. How does 5 become 6? Maybe there's a pattern where if a certain number is present in a 3x3 grid, it's transformed. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking for numbers that are adjacent in the input. Let's check Example 0's output first row [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]. Let's look at the input rows. The input rows start with:\n\nRow 0: [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [8,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [8,8,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,2,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,2,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n... etc.\n\nWait, perhaps each output cell corresponds to a 2x2 block in the input. Let's take the first output row's first element 6. Let's see the 2x2 block in the input's top-left corner. The first two rows, first two columns:\n\nRow 0: 5,5\n\nRow 1:8,5\n\nSo the block is:\n\n5 5\n\n8 5\n\nHmm, how does that become 6? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the maximum value in the block. The max here is 8. But the output is 6. Hmm. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, sum? 5+5+8+5=23. Not 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output cell is the count of non-zero elements in the block. But 5 and 8 are non-zero, so 4 non-zero elements. That gives 4. Not 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid for each input's 3x3 grid, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for the output numbers in the input. For example, in Example 0's output first row, 6 appears. Where does 6 come from in the input? Looking through the input lists, I don't see any 6s. Similarly, the output has numbers like 1,2,5,6,8,9. The input has 5,8,2,0, etc. Wait, in the input of Example 0, the last few rows:\n\nRow 11: [5,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,3,0,6,6,5,0]\n\nRow 12: [5,5,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,5,5,0]\n\nRow 13: [5,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0]\n\nSo there are 6s in row 11 and 12. So perhaps the output is taking elements from the input's lower rows or right columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformed version where certain patterns are replaced. For example, in the input, sequences of the same number are replaced by a different number. For instance, the first input row has three 5s, which in the output becomes 6,6,5. Wait, 5 becomes 6? But in other parts, 2s become 2s. For example, in the first output row, the 2s are from the input's 2s in row 1 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a cellular automaton-like transformation where each cell's new value depends on its neighbors. But how to determine the rule.\n\nAnother angle: look at the output structure. The outputs for the examples are all 9 rows. So perhaps the input is 14 rows, and the output is 9 rows by taking a central portion. But how 14 rows become 9. Maybe subtracting 5 from top and bottom (14-5*2=4, which doesn't fit). Alternatively, the output is formed by taking rows 3 to 11 (9 rows) from the input. Let's check Example 0's output rows. For instance, the first output row [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]. Looking at the input rows, perhaps the output rows correspond to certain rows in the input. But in the input of Example 0, the rows start with 5,5,5, then 8,5,5, etc. The output starts with 6,6,5. I don't see a direct row in the input that matches that.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a combination of overlapping rows. For example, the first output row could be the maximum of three consecutive input rows. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, first three rows:\n\nRow0: 5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow1:8,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0\n\nRow2:8,8,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,5,0,0,0\n\nIf taking the maximum of these rows element-wise:\n\nFor each column, take the maximum of the three rows. For example:\n\nFirst column: max(5,8,8) =8\n\nSecond column: max(5,5,8)=8\n\nThird column: max(5,5,5)=5\n\nFourth column: max(0,0,0)=0, etc.\n\nBut the output's first row starts with 6,6,5. So this approach doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is a sum of three consecutive input rows. But the numbers are higher than the input, but 5+8+8=21, which is way higher than 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is formed by some pattern where adjacent cells in the input are merged. For example, taking every other element or overlapping windows.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 0, the first row's elements: 6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1.\n\nLooking at the input, perhaps the first three elements (5,5,5) in row0 are transformed into 6,6,5. Then, in row1, the elements at positions 8-10 (0-based) are 2,2,2, which in output are 2,2,2. Then in row0's end, there's a lot of zeros, but in the output it's 5,1,1. Wait, where do the 1s come from?\n\nLooking at the input rows, maybe the 1s in the output come from later rows. For example, in the input row7: [0,5,1,1,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,4,5,0]. The 1s are there. But how do they end up in the first output row?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is built by combining elements from different parts of the input. For example, the first element of the output could be from the second row, first element (8) but transformed into 6. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for the numbers in the output and see where they appear in the input. For example, the first output row's first element is 6. In the input of Example0, row11 has 6,6,5. So maybe the output is taking parts from the lower rows and right columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by transposing the input and then taking certain parts. But transposing a 14x14 would be 14 rows of 14 elements, same as before. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a result of scanning the input grid in some way. For example, moving a window and applying a rule. For instance, if a 3x3 area in the input has a certain pattern, it's converted to a different number.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could involve looking for contiguous blocks of numbers in the input and then representing them in the output in a condensed form. For example, if there's a 3x3 block of 5s, it becomes a single 5 in the output. But the output seems to have more elements than that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as a grid where non-zero numbers form shapes, and the output is a compressed version where overlapping shapes are merged. For example, in Example0's input, the first three rows have 5s and 8s. The output's first row starts with 6,6,5. Maybe each number in the output represents a combination of different numbers from overlapping regions.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers could be the counts of certain numbers in the input's vicinity. For example, the number of times a particular number appears in a 3x3 grid around each position. But how would that explain the numbers in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a maze-like structure where each cell represents the number of exits in the input's grid. But that seems complicated.\n\nAnother idea: the output rows are each 9 elements, which is 3*3. Wait, no, 9 elements in a row. But the examples have 9 rows. So maybe the output is a 9x9 grid. The input is 14x14 (for example0). So the output is a smaller grid. Perhaps the transformation involves looking at 2x2 blocks in the input and taking the maximum, sum, or some other function.\n\nFor example, if the input is 14x14, to get a 9x9 output, each output cell could correspond to a 2x2 block in the input, starting from some offset. Let's check:\n\n14 divided by 2 is 7, but the output is 9. Hmm, perhaps overlapping blocks. For example, a sliding window of 2x2 with a stride of 1. For a 14x14 input, the output would be 13x13, which isn't matching. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a center 9x9 portion of the input. Let's see. For a 14x14 input, the center 9x9 would start at position (3,3) to (11,11). But looking at the first input row of Example0, the elements from index 3 to 11 are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 (positions 3-11). But the output's first row has non-zero numbers. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the output is some kind of edge detection. For example, numbers in the output represent changes in the input's grid. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think differently. The output for Example0's first row is [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]. Looking at the input rows, perhaps each element in the output is derived from a diagonal or some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the output are the sum of the numbers in a certain pattern around each cell. For example, for each output cell (i,j), it's the sum of the input cell (i, j) and its neighbors. But again, the numbers don't seem to add up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a transformed version where each number is replaced by the next higher number. For example, 5 becomes 6, 2 becomes 3, etc. But in the first output row, there's a 5, so that doesn't fit. For example, in the first output row, we have 6,6,5. If 5 becomes 6, but the third element is 5. Hmm, inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the count of a certain number in a 3x3 area. For instance, how many 5s are in the 3x3 grid around a cell. Let's try that. Take the first cell of Example0's input. The cell at (0,0) is 5. The 3x3 grid around it (assuming it's the top-left corner) would include cells (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Values are 5,5,8,5. The count of 5s here is 3. But the output is 6. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a code where each digit represents a different combination. For example, if three 5s are present in a row, they are replaced by 6,6,5. But why?\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output rows:\n\nFirst output row: [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]\n\nSecond output row: [6,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,1]\n\nThird: all 5s.\n\nFourth: [2,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3]\n\nHmm, maybe the output is a result of merging adjacent same numbers. For example, in the input, three 5s in a row become 6,6,5. Then two 5s might become 5,5, and so on. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAnother observation: in the output rows, the numbers 6, 2, 5, 1 appear in the first row. Let's see where they are in the input. The 6s in the output might correspond to the 8s in the input's first rows. For example, in input row1 and 2, there are 8s. The output has 6s. Maybe 8 is transformed to 6. But why? Perhaps subtracting 2. But 5 becomes 6 (adding 1). 2 becomes 2. 1 becomes 1. Hmm, inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers in the output are the sum of digits in some way. For example, 8 (input) could split into 6 and 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a result of applying a keypad-like transformation. For example, each number is mapped based on its position. Like on a phone keypad, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Example0's output, the third row is all 5s. Looking at the input, maybe that's a central row where all elements are 5s. But the input's third row is [8,8,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,5,0,0,0], which doesn't have all 5s. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output is a transformation of the input's non-zero elements. For example, in each row of the output, non-zero numbers from the input are arranged in a certain way. For instance, the first input row has three 5s followed by zeros. The output's first row has 6,6,5, then 2s (from row1), then 5, then 1s (from row7). So maybe it's combining elements from different rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the input's rows, columns, and diagonals. But without a clear pattern, it's hard to see.\n\nWait, looking at the output rows of Example0, the middle row is all 5s. Perhaps this represents the center of the input. The input's middle rows (around row6 or 7) have various numbers. Maybe the all-5s row in the output is a result of some averaging or majority in the input's center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a maze where certain paths are highlighted. But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output is the result of a BFS or DFS traversal of the input grid, collecting numbers in a certain order. For example, starting from the top-left, moving right, then down, etc., but I don't see a direct correlation.\n\nAlternatively, each output row corresponds to a diagonal in the input. For example, the first output row might be the main diagonal of the input. Let's check. The first input row's first element is 5. Second row's second element is 5. Third row's third element is 5. Fourth row's fourth element is 5. Fifth row's fifth element is 0. So the main diagonal would be 5,5,5,5,0,... which doesn't match the output's first row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is a combination of multiple diagonals. Not sure.\n\nMaybe the answer lies in recognizing that the output is a 9x9 grid, and the input is a 14x14 grid. The transformation involves centering or scaling down. For example, each 2x2 block in the input is averaged or maximized to form a single element in the output. But how does that work with the numbers given?\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking every other element from the input. For example, the first output row is the even-indexed elements of the input's first few rows. But in Example0's first input row, taking every other element would give [5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (length 9), but the output starts with 6,6,5. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is a result of encoding the input's structure into a smaller grid, where each output cell represents the presence of certain numbers in a region. For example, the number in the output is the highest number present in a particular region of the input. Let's check Example0's first output row. The first three elements are 6,6,5. The input's top-left region has 5,5,5 in the first row, and 8,5,5 in the second, and 8,8,5 in the third. The maximum in that 3x3 area is 8. But the output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output number is the sum of the input's region modulo some number. For example, sum of 5+8+8+5+5+5+8+5+5= ... not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a magic square or some numerical pattern, but I don't see it.\n\nWait, looking at the output's structure in Example0:\n\nFirst three rows:\n\n[6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]\n\n[6,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,1]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nThese rows start with higher numbers and transition into lower numbers. The middle row is all 5s. The fourth row starts with 2 and ends with 3, etc. It's possible that the output is a kind of diamond shape, with 5s in the center and other numbers around.\n\nBut how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a result of certain movements. For example, shifting rows or columns.\n\nWait, in the input of Example0, the first row has three 5s. The output's first row starts with 6,6,5. Maybe there's a shift to the right. Like, each element is moved and transformed. For example, the first three 5s are replaced with 6,6,5. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is similar to a Caesar cipher, shifting numbers by a certain value. For example, 5 becomes 6 (shift +1), 8 becomes 6 (shift -2), 2 becomes 2 (no shift), 1 becomes 1. But this is inconsistent.\n\nAnother possibility: the output numbers are the number of adjacent non-zero elements in the input. For example, each cell in the output counts how many of its neighboring cells in the input are non-zero. For instance, a cell with two non-zero neighbors would be 2. Let's test this.\n\nTake the first cell of Example0's input. The cell at (0,0) is 5. Its neighbors are (0,1)=5, (1,0)=8, and (1,1)=5. So three non-zero neighbors. The output's first cell is 6. Doesn't match. Unless it's counting in a larger area.\n\nAlternatively, the count is of non-zero cells in a 3x3 grid around the cell. For cell (0,0), the 3x3 grid would include cells (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). All non-zero. That's 4 non-zero cells. The output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the count is multiplied by some factor. 4*1.5=6. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is a result of applying a kernel convolution. For example, using a kernel like [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]] and summing the product. But without knowing the kernel, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the sum of the input's cell and its immediate neighbors. For example, (0,0) cell is 5, neighbors (0,1)=5, (1,0)=8, (1,1)=5. Sum is 5+5+8+5=23. But output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, considering that 5+8+8=21. 21 modulo 10 is 1, but the output is 6. No.\n\nAnother approach: look at the Test Input. Let's see the Test Input's rows. For example, the first row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0]. Maybe the output would start with something related to these 5s. Looking at the training examples, when there are three 5s in a row, they might become 6,6,5. So perhaps the first three 5s here become 6,6,5. But in the test input, the 5s are at positions 10,11,12. So maybe the output row would start with 6,6,5 for those.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's try to find a pattern from the examples.\n\nLooking at Example0's output rows:\n\nThe first output row has 6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1.\n\nLooking at the input rows, the first part (6,6,5) might correspond to the 5s in row0 and 8s in row1 and 2. The 2s in the output might come from the 2s in row1 and 2. The 5s in the output might come from other rows. The 1s could come from row7's 1s.\n\nBut how are these combined? Maybe each output row is a composite of multiple input rows, taking elements from different positions.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the first occurrence of each number in the input's columns and aggregating them. For example, for each column in the input, the first non-zero number becomes part of the output. But in the first column of Example0's input, the first non-zero is 5 (row0), then 8 (row1), 8 (row2), etc. The output's first column has 6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1. So the first output row's first element is 6, which doesn't match any of the input's first column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a result of rotating the input grid. For example, rotating 90 degrees, but that doesn't seem to fit the numbers.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0's output, the third row is all 5s. The middle of the output is all 5s, suggesting that perhaps the output is a diamond shape with 5s in the center. But how to derive that from the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a result of a run-length encoding. For example, in the input rows, sequences of numbers are encoded as a different number followed by their count. But the output doesn't seem to follow this.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers could be the sum of the digits in the input's cells when treated as a number. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the output's first row of Example0: [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]. The numbers 6,2,5,1 appear. In the input, these numbers are present in later rows. For example, 6 appears in row11 and 12. 2 appears in row1,2,3, etc. 1 appears in row7,8. So maybe the output is combining elements from different rows and columns in a specific order.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a transformed version where each row in the output is a combination of three input rows. For example, the first output row combines input rows0,1,2; the second combines rows1,2,3; and so on. For each output cell, perhaps take the maximum, sum, or other operation of the three input rows' corresponding cells.\n\nLet's test this for Example0's first output row. Take input rows0,1,2:\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [8,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [8,8,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,5,0,0,0]\n\nIf we take the maximum of these three rows for each column:\n\nFirst column: max(5,8,8)=8\n\nSecond column: max(5,5,8)=8\n\nThird column: max(5,5,5)=5\n\nFourth column: max(0,0,0)=0\n\n... and so on.\n\nBut the output's first row starts with 6,6,5, which doesn't match this. So this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, sum the three rows:\n\nFirst column:5+8+8=21. How does 21 become 6? 21 modulo 10 is 1. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: look for the output numbers as being present in the input as adjacent triplets. For example, 6,6,5 in the output could correspond to a triplet in the input. In Example0's input, row11 has [5,5,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,5,5,0]. The triplet 6,5,5 is present here. But how that translates to the output's first row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the last three non-zero numbers in each input row and transforming them. But the first input row of Example0 has three 5s, which in the output become 6,6,5. So maybe each group of three same numbers is replaced by two of the next higher number and one same. For example, three 5s become 6,6,5. But then, three 2s become 2,2,2. Which matches Example0's first output row, which has 2,2,2. So that could be a possible pattern.\n\nLet's see:\n\nIf three of the same number X in a row are replaced by (X+1), (X+1), X.\n\nSo three 5s become 6,6,5.\n\nThree 2s become 3,3,2. But in the output, they remain 2,2,2. So that's a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe three of the same number X are replaced by (X+1), (X+1), (X+1). But that would make three 6s from three 5s. But the output has two 6s and a 5.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the first two numbers are incremented, and the third remains. So three 5s become 6,6,5. That's possible. Three 2s would become 3,3,2. But in Example0's output, the 2s remain 2s. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied only to certain numbers. For example, 5s are transformed into 6,6,5, but 2s are left as-is. But that's arbitrary and not a consistent rule.\n\nAnother observation: the output's numbers are all either the same as the input or one higher/lower. For example, 5 becomes 6, 8 becomes 6, etc. Maybe it's related to the position of the number in a certain sequence.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by a substitution cipher where each number is replaced by another number. For example:\n\n5 -> 6\n\n8 ->6\n\n2->2\n\n1->1\n\nBut why would 5 and 8 both become 6?\n\nAlternatively, numbers are mapped based on their digits. For example, 5 and 8 are mapped to 6 because 5+8=13, and 1+3=4, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers in the output are the sum of adjacent digits. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: looking at Example0 and Example1's outputs, the middle row is all 5s. So perhaps the output has a central row of 5s, and other rows are transformed based on their distance from the center. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 9x9 grid where each row is a transformed version of the corresponding input row. For example, each output row is a compressed version of the input row. For example, in the first input row of Example0, [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which has three 5s followed by zeros. The output row is [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]. Maybe the first three 5s are replaced with 6,6,5, then the zeros are replaced with other numbers from later in the input.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first non-zero element from each column of the input. For Example0's first column, the first non-zero is 5 (row0), then 8 (row1), 8 (row2), etc. But the output's first column starts with 6,6,5. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is a combination of the input's rows in reverse order. For example, the first output row combines the last three rows of the input. But in Example0's input, the last few rows have 5,9,9, etc. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let's try to look for another approach.\n\nLet me compare the input and output dimensions. For Example0, the input is 14 rows of 14 elements each. The output is 9 rows of 9 elements. So the output is a 9x9 grid, and the input is 14x14. The difference is 5 rows and 5 columns. So maybe the output is the input's central 9x9 section. Let's check. For example, the first row of the input is [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The central 9 elements would be from index 2 to 11 (inclusive), which would be 5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. But the output's first row is [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1], which doesn't match. So this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by rotating the input grid and then taking a section. For example, rotating 45 degrees, but this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern from the training examples to apply. The test input has 16 rows. Each row has 15 elements. The output should have 9 rows of 9 elements each, based on the training examples.\n\nLooking at the test input, rows 0-2 have elements like 0s and 5s, and later rows have 1,6,2, etc. For example, row2: [0,1,1,5,0,2,2,2,0,0,6,6,5,0,0]. The output might start with transformed versions of these numbers.\n\nIn the training examples, the outputs seem to have sequences like [X,X,X, Y,Y,Y, Z,Z,Z], but the output rows are of length 9. For example, the first output row of Example0 is [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1], which has three 6s, three 2s, and three 1s. But not exactly. Wait, 6,6,5 (three elements), then 2,2,2 (three), then 5,1,1 (three). So three groups of three. But how does this relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by splitting the input rows into groups of three elements and transforming each group. For example, in Example0's first input row, the first three elements are 5,5,5 \u2192 transformed to 6,6,5. The next three elements are 0,0,0 \u2192 transformed to 2,2,2. The next three are 0,0,0 \u2192 5,1,1. But this doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is a combination of three input cells. But the output has 9 rows, so this isn't applicable.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0's output, the first row has 6,6,5, which could correspond to the three 5s in the input's first row. The 2s correspond to the three 2s in the input's row1. The 5 and 1s could be from other parts of the input. So maybe each group of three same numbers in the input is transformed into a new set of numbers. For example, three 5s become 6,6,5. Three 2s become 2,2,2. Three 1s become 5,1,1. But this doesn't hold for all cases.\n\nFor example, in Example0's input row7: [0,5,1,1,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,4,5,0]. The three 1s would become something, but in the output's first row, the 1s are present as 1,1. So maybe it's not that.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first three non-zero numbers from each input row and transforming them. For example, the first input row of Example0 has three 5s \u2192 transformed to 6,6,5. The next input row has three 5s \u2192 transformed to 5,5,5. But the output's second row starts with 6,5,5. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm not making progress. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output rows, they often start with a certain number, followed by variations. For example, the first output row of Example0 starts with 6,6,5. The second row starts with 6,5,5. The third is all 5s. This suggests a sort of triangular pattern, perhaps where the numbers decrease or change towards the center.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is a result of some image processing technique, like edge detection, where the numbers represent edges. But I don't know how to apply that here.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the result of a mathematical operation involving their position. For example, row number plus column number modulo some value. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, the output for Example0 has 9 rows. The test input has 16 rows. So the pattern might involve taking every other row, or selecting specific rows. For example, in the training examples, the input has 14 rows and the output 9. So 14 - 5 =9. Maybe the first 5 and last 5 rows are removed. 14-10=4, not 9. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by merging two or three input rows. For example, each output row is the average of two input rows. But in Example0's output, the first row starts with 6, which is not the average of 5 and 8 (which would be 6.5, but rounded down to 6). Maybe this is possible. Let's check:\n\nRow0 and Row1 of input Example0:\n\nRow0:5,5,5,0,0,0,...\n\nRow1:8,5,5,0,0,0,...\n\nAverage of corresponding elements: (5+8)/2=6.5\u21926, (5+5)/2=5, (5+5)/2=5, etc. So the first three elements would be 6,5,5. But the output's first row starts with 6,6,5. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, merging three rows. For example, (row0 + row1 + row2) /3:\n\n(5+8+8)/3=7, (5+5+8)/3=6, (5+5+5)/3=5. Which would give 7,6,5. But the output starts with 6,6,5. Close but not exact.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps each output cell is the number of times a certain condition is met in the input's corresponding area. For example, how many times a number increases or decreases. But without a clear rule, this is hard to determine.\n\nPerhaps the answer is simpler. Looking at Example0's output, each row has a pattern where certain numbers are grouped. For example, the first row has two 6s followed by a 5, three 2s, a 5, then two 1s. The second row has a 6, three 5s, a 2, three 5s, and a 1. This suggests that the output is constructed by combining elements from different parts of the input in a specific order.\n\nMaybe each output row is formed by concatenating three sections from three different parts of the input. For example, the first three elements from the top-left, the next three from the middle, and the last three from the bottom-right. But this is guesswork.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a result of a breadth-first search traversal of the input grid, collecting numbers in a spiral order. But without a clear example, this is hard to confirm.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I think I need to look for a different approach. Let's compare the test input to the training examples and see if there's a structural similarity.\n\nThe test input has rows with 1s, 2s, 5s, 6s, 8s, etc. For example, row2 has 1,1,5, 2,2,2, 6,6,5. The training examples also have similar groupings. For example, Example0's input has 5s, 8s, 2s, etc. The output in Example0 for such groupings became 6,6,5 and 2,2,2.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for any contiguous block of three of the same number in the input, replace it with two increments of that number followed by the original. For example, three 5s become 6,6,5. Three 2s become 3,3,2, but in the output, the 2s remain 2s. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is specific to the number 5. Any three 5s become 6,6,5. Other numbers remain the same. But in Example0's output, there are 2s and 1s, which were present in the input.\n\nWait, in the first input row of Example0, three 5s become 6,6,5. In the input's row1, three 2s are present and in the output, they become 2,2,2. So maybe only 5s are transformed. But in Example0's input row11, there are two 6s, which in the output are present as 6,6,5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to take the first two numbers of a triplet and increment them, and keep the third. For example, triplet 5,5,5 becomes 6,6,5. Triplet 8,8,5 becomes 8,8,5 \u2192 transformed to 9,9,5? But in the output, there are 8s and 9s. Not sure.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is formed by taking each 3x3 block from the input, and the output cell is the number of unique numbers in that block. For example, in the top-left 3x3 block of Example0's input:\n\nRows 0-2, columns 0-2:\n\n5 5 5\n\n8 5 5\n\n8 8 5\n\nUnique numbers: 5,8 \u2192 count 2. But the output cell is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell is the sum of unique numbers. 5+8=13 \u2192 1+3=4. No.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell is the product of the first and last elements of the block. 5 (top-left) *5 (top-right) =25 \u2192 2+5=7. No.\n\nAt this point, I'm really stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input, the first few rows have sequences like 5,5,5 which in the training examples became 6,6,5. So I'll apply that transformation. Then, sequences of 2,2,2 would become 2,2,2 (as in the training examples). Similarly, sequences of 1,1,5 might become 2,2,1.\n\nBut this is speculative. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach and generate the output based on the training pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input and output examples, and we need to find the transformation that turns the input into the output. Then apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at the first training example (Example 0):\n\nThe input is a list of 14 lists (each of length 14?), and the output is 9 lists, each of length 9. So, maybe the output is a transformation of the input grid into a smaller grid. Like, maybe each output row is derived from certain columns of the input rows. Let's check.\n\nFor instance, in Example 0's input, the first input row is [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The first output row is [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]. Hmm, maybe there's a specific way to pick elements from the input rows. Let's compare positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 9x9 grid, and each of the 9 output rows is formed by taking non-zero elements from certain parts of the input. Wait, the input rows in Example 0 are 14 elements each, and there are 14 rows. The output is 9 rows of 9 elements each. So maybe the output is a central 9x9 section, but that might not explain it since the input has 14 elements. Or perhaps it's a matter of collapsing multiple rows or columns.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by taking the third through eleventh elements (columns) of each of the third through eleventh rows (rows) of the input. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, input has 14 rows. The output has 9 rows, so maybe rows 3-11 (since 14-3 = 11?), but not sure. Let's take the first input row of Example 0: [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output starts with [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]. Not sure. Maybe each output row corresponds to a specific input row, but the numbers are transformed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output cell is the sum or some operation of surrounding cells in the input. But looking at the numbers in the output, they seem to be present in the input. For example, in Example 0's output, the first row has 6,6,5. Looking at the input rows, there's a row with 8,8,5... but not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the first output row of Example 0: [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]. Let's see if these numbers appear in the input. The number 6 doesn't appear in the input. Wait, the input in Example 0 has numbers like 5,8,2, etc. So maybe 6 is derived somehow. Maybe it's the count of adjacent similar numbers? Or some other operation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a compressed version where sequences of the same number are replaced by their count and the number. For example, 6,6,5 could be 2 times 6 followed by 5. But that doesn't explain the original input. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by looking at the non-zero elements in each row of the input, but in a certain way. For example, in the first input row of Example 0: [5,5,5,0,...], the output starts with 6,6,5. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe each output row is a combination of elements from two input rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a grid where certain regions are being transformed. For example, each output row corresponds to a 3x3 region in the input. But how?\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output rows in Example 0, the middle row is all 5s. So maybe when there's a central part of the input that's surrounded by certain numbers, the output's middle row is all 5s.\n\nLooking at the test input, the output needs to be in the same format as the training examples. Let's check the test input structure. The test input has 16 rows, each with 15 elements. The output should probably have 9 rows of 9 elements each, similar to the training examples.\n\nWait, in the training examples, the number of output rows is 9. Example 0's input has 14 rows, but the output is 9 rows. So maybe the output is a 9x9 grid, perhaps the center of the input? Let's see. If the input is 14x14, taking rows 3-11 (9 rows) and columns 3-11 (9 columns) would give a 9x9 output. Let's check that.\n\nTake Example 0's input. The third row (0-indexed) is [8, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0]. If we take columns 3 to 11 (indices 3 to 11 inclusive), that's elements 0,0,0,0,0,5,2,5,0. But the output's first row is [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1], which doesn't match. So that approach might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is a concatenation of certain elements from multiple input rows. For example, taking elements from the third, fourth, and fifth rows and certain columns. But this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from each row of the input and padding them to form 9 elements. Let's see. For example, in the first input row of Example 0: [5,5,5,0,...], the non-zero elements are three 5s. The output's first row starts with 6,6,5. Doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: the output might be a transformation where each element is the sum of adjacent elements in the input. But looking at Example 0's output, the first element is 6, which isn't present in the input. So maybe it's a different operation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the output represent the count of a certain value in the corresponding region of the input. For example, if the input has a cluster of 8s, the output might have a 6 there. But I need to see a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. Let's take the first output row: [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]. The numbers 6, 2, 5, 1. Do these correspond to counts of certain numbers in the input? Let's check the input rows.\n\nLooking at the first input row of Example 0: [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The first three elements are 5s. The output starts with 6,6,5. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a result of some sort of encoding. For example, the number of consecutive non-zero elements in a row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformed version where each row in the output is built from three parts of the input rows. For instance, taking the first three non-zero elements from certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a diagonal or spiral pattern. For example, moving through the input grid in a certain way to form the output.\n\nAnother approach: look for the numbers in the output and see where they appear in the input. For Example 0's output, the first row has 6, which isn't in the input. So maybe 6 is derived from other numbers.\n\nWait, maybe the output numbers are the sum of certain digits in the input. For example, 5+1=6. Let's check. The first output element is 6. Looking at the input rows, maybe there's a 5 and a 1 in adjacent cells. Let's check the input for Example 0. The first output row's first element is 6. Looking at the input rows, maybe in the third row (index 2) of the input: [8,8,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,5,0,0,0]. The elements around position 0 could be 8 and 8. Not adding to 6. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a result of some bitwise operation. But the numbers vary widely, so that's unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by looking at 3x3 blocks in the input and taking the center or some other value. For example, each 3x3 block in the input becomes a single value in the output. But then the output size would be smaller. Let's see: if the input is 14x14, dividing into 3x3 blocks would give 4x4 blocks (since 14/3 is 4.666), but the output is 9x9. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is a combination of three input rows. For example, output row 0 is input rows 0, 1, 2 combined in some way. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output again. The output has 9 rows. The input has 14 rows. Perhaps each output row is formed by merging two input rows. For example, output row 0 could be rows 0-1, row 1-2, etc. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the transpose of a certain section of the input. For example, taking columns 5-13 from rows 5-13 and transposing. But need to check.\n\nAnother thought: The numbers in the output could be the maximum value in a certain area of the input. For example, the first element of the output could be the maximum of a 3x3 area in the input. Let's check. In Example 0's first output element is 6. Looking at the input, if the first element's area includes numbers like 5,8, etc., but 6 isn't present. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe each output element is the count of a certain number in a region. For example, the 6 could be the count of 8s in a certain area. Let's check. For Example 0's output, first element 6. Are there six 8s in the input's first few rows? Let's see. Input rows 0: [5,5,5...], no 8s. Row 1: [8,5,5...], one 8. Row 2: [8,8,5...], two 8s. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a result of concatenating certain parts of the input. For example, taking elements from the middle part. Let's see: The output in Example 0 has 9 elements per row. The input rows have 14 elements. If we take elements 3 to 11 (inclusive) of each row, that's 9 elements. Let's check.\n\nFor Example 0's first input row: [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Elements 3-11 (indices 3 to 11) are [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But the first output row is [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]. Doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's look at another example. Example 1's input and output.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the first row is [7,7,5,1,1,1,5,8,8]. The input's first row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,4]. Taking elements 5-13 (indices 5 to 13) would be [0,0,0,5,5,4]. Not matching. But the output starts with 7,7,5. So maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output is formed by taking the first occurrence of each number in the input rows and arranging them in a certain way. For example, in Example 0's first output row, 6 appears twice. But 6 isn't in the input. So this can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the output numbers are derived by adding 1 to certain numbers in the input. For example, 5 becomes 6. But in Example 0's output, the first element is 6. Let's see if there's a 5 in the corresponding input area. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output is a result of applying a Caesar cipher shift, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is formed by taking the numbers from a diagonal of the input grid. For example, the main diagonal. Let's check. For Example 0's input, the main diagonal would be 5 (from row 0, column 0), 5 (row1, column1), 5 (row2, column2), 5 (row3, column3), etc. But the output's first row starts with 6, which isn't in the diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by overlaying certain patterns from the input. For example, looking for shapes like \"L\" or \"T\" made by numbers and converting them into different numbers. This is vague, though.\n\nWait, looking at the output rows in both examples, the middle row (fourth row in Example 0's output) is all 5s. So perhaps whenever there's a central area in the input that's filled with 5s, the output's middle row is all 5s. Let's check the input for Example 0. The middle input rows might have a lot of 5s. For example, input row 6 (0-based index 6) in Example 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0], which has a lot of 5s. The output's middle row (index 4) is all 5s. Hmm, maybe when the input has a cross or a cluster of 5s, the output's middle row is all 5s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid repeated three times, but that doesn't fit the 9 rows.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking every other row and column from the input, scaled down. For example, taking rows 0, 2, 4,... and columns 0, 2, 4,... But Example 0's input has 14 rows, which would become 7 rows if taking every other, but the output has 9. So no.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a transformation where each row is formed by combining three consecutive input rows, and each element is the sum of the three elements in that column. For example, output row 0 is sum of input rows 0,1,2. Let's test.\n\nFor Example 0's first input rows:\n\nRow0: 5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow1:8,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0\n\nRow2:8,8,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,5,0,0,0\n\nSum of columns: 5+8+8=21, 5+5+8=18, etc. But the output's first row starts with 6. Doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are the differences between consecutive input rows. For example, output row 0 is row1 - row0. Let's see. For Example 0, row1 - row0 would be 8-5=3, 5-5=0, etc. Not matching the output.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I need to look for another approach. Let's consider that each output row has the same length as the number of input rows, but that's not the case here. The outputs in both examples are 9 elements per row, 9 rows. The input rows vary in length (14 and 16 in test input), but the output is always 9x9.\n\nWait, the test input has 16 rows, each with 15 elements. The output needs to be 9 rows of 9 elements each. So the transformation must involve selecting 9 rows and 9 columns from the input.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output is a 9x9 grid taken from the center of the input. For example, if the input is 14x14, then taking rows 3-11 (9 rows) and columns 3-11 (9 columns) gives the output. Let's check Example 0.\n\nExample 0's input row 3 (0-based index 3) is [0, 0, 2, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]. Taking columns 3-11 (indices 3 to 11) would be [5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,0]. The output row 0 is [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]. Doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is the sum of a 3x3 block in the input. But 3x3 blocks would make the output 4x4 for a 14x14 input, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output, the first row has [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]. Let's look at the input to see if there are any sequences of numbers that could form this. For example, 6 isn't present, but maybe it's derived from the numbers around it. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the input rows, perhaps the first output row is derived from the first three input rows. For instance, taking the first three elements of each row. Row0: 5,5,5; Row1:8,5,5; Row2:8,8,5. The first output elements are 6,6,5. Maybe the average? (5+8+8)/3=7, which isn't 6. Or maybe the mode. The numbers are 5,8,8. The mode is 8. No. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: Look at the test input and see if we can find a pattern that would apply there. The test input has elements like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Maybe the output numbers are related to these in some way. For example, in the test input's first row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0]. If the output is supposed to take the 5s and surrounding numbers, maybe the first output row would have 5s and some other numbers. But without knowing the pattern, it's hard.\n\nWait, looking at the output examples, the first and last rows often have sequences like [x, x, y, z, z, z, ...], which might suggest that they're capturing transitions between numbers. For example, in Example 0's first output row: [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]. It has two 6s, a 5, three 2s, a 5, and two 1s. This looks like counts of consecutive numbers, but not exactly. Wait, if the numbers are grouped into runs, maybe the output is encoding those runs. For example, 6,6,5 could be two 6s followed by a 5. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is a combination of two different input rows, alternating elements. For example, first element from row0, second from row1, etc. But not sure.\n\nAnother thought: the output is formed by taking the numbers from the input in a spiral order. Starting from the top-left, spiraling inward, and then arranging them in rows. But this would require a specific traversal, and the output rows wouldn't necessarily line up the way they do.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the result of applying a convolutional filter to the input grid. For example, edge detection highlighting certain numbers. But the numbers in the output don't seem to correspond to that.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the first non-zero element from each column in a certain range of rows. For example, for each column in the input, the first non-zero value in rows 0-8 becomes the first output row, then rows 1-9 for the second, etc. But this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output rows, they seem to have a mix of numbers that could be forming borders around the 5s. For example, in Example 0's output, the first row has 6,6,5, then 2,2,2, then 5,1,1. Maybe each number represents a different 'region' in the input, with 5 being the central region and others being surrounding regions. For example, 6 could be the border around 5, and 2 around that, etc. But this is vague.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a result of a cellular automaton step. Applying some rule to the input to generate the output. But without knowing the rule, it's hard to deduce.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output element is the number of times a certain number appears in a specific position across the input rows. For example, the first element of the output is the count of 6s in the first position of the input rows. But in Example 0's input, no 6s are present. So that's not it.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think differently. Let's look at the test input and see if there's a pattern in the way numbers are arranged. For example, in the test input, the first row has 5,5,5 at columns 10-12. Then in other rows, there are 1s, 2s, 6s, 8s, etc. The output needs to have 9 rows. So perhaps the output is focusing on certain clusters or features in the input.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the outputs seem to have a structure where certain numbers are placed symmetrically. For instance, in Example 0's output, the first row has 6,6,5, then 2,2,2, then 5,1,1. This suggests a kind of symmetry around the central 5s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformed version where each number is replaced by a different number based on its position. For example, 5 remains 5, 8 becomes 6, 2 becomes 2, etc. But in Example 0's output, the first element is 6, and the input has an 8 nearby. So maybe 8 maps to 6. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, there are 8s in the first few rows. The output has 6s. So maybe 8 becomes 6. Similarly, in Example 1's input, the output has 7s where the input has 8s. Wait, in Example 1's output first row is [7,7,5,1,1,1,5,8,8]. The input has 8s in certain places, but the output has 8s as well. So that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are the sum of the digits of the numbers in the input. For example, 8 would be 8, but 6 isn't a sum. Not helpful.\n\nThis is taking too long. Maybe I should try to find a pattern between input and output positions. Let's take Example 0's input and output and see if there's a direct mapping.\n\nExample 0's input row 0: [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput row 0: [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]\n\nIf I look at the output row, the first three elements are 6,6,5. The input's first three elements are 5,5,5. So maybe 5s are transformed into 6s except the last one? But then why. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first three elements of the input, then the next three, etc., but with some transformation. For example, each triplet is converted into a certain number based on their values.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by looking at the positions of non-zero elements in the input. For example, the first non-zero in each row becomes the output's first element, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the input grid rotated 90 degrees and then scaled down. But the input has 14 rows, and output 9. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a compressed version of the input, where sequences of the same number are replaced by their count and the number. For example, three 5s become 3,5. But in Example 0's output, the first elements are 6,6,5, which would imply counts of 6 and 5, which isn't present in the input. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the output numbers are the sum of the row and column indices of the input cell. For example, if a cell in the input is at row i, column j, the output would be i + j. But in Example 0's output, the first element is 6. If it's the sum of some indices, say row 3 and column 3: 3+3=6. Let's check input row 3, column 3. Input row 3 is [0,0,2,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0]. Column 3 (0-based) is 5. So output element is 6, which is not 5. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the output is formed by looking at the input grid and for each cell in the output, it's the number of distinct regions of a certain number surrounding it. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a puzzle solution where numbers represent something like the number of adjacent walls in a maze. But again, without clear rules.\n\nThis is really tough. Given the time I've spent without progress, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the output rows in the training examples. They seem to have a structure where certain numbers are grouped together. For example, in Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: 6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1\n\nRow 1:6,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,1\n\nRow 2:5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n\nRow 3:2,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3\n\nRow 4:2,2,5,5,5,5,5,3,3\n\nRow 5:2,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3\n\nRow 6:5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n\nRow 7:8,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,9\n\nRow 8:8,8,5,4,4,4,5,9,9\n\nLooking at this, the middle rows (2 and 6) are all 5s. The other rows have varying numbers. The numbers increase as you move outward. For example, the first row has 6s and 2s and 1s, which are lower than 8s and 9s in the last rows. This suggests that the output might be a kind of layers around a central core of 5s.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that the input represents a kind of layered structure, and the output is a compressed version where each layer is represented by a certain number. For example, the outermost layer in the input is represented by 8 and 9, then inward layers by 6 and 7, then 2 and 3, etc., with 5 in the center. But how does this relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a transformation where numbers are shifted based on their position. For example, numbers on the edges are increased or decreased by a certain value. But in Example 0's output, the first row has 6s which aren't present in the input's edges.\n\nAnother observation: in both training examples, the output has a row with all 5s. This suggests that the input's center is filled with 5s, and the output's middle row represents that. The surrounding rows have other numbers that perhaps represent the neighboring values in the input.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Given that this is taking too long, maybe I should look for a pattern where the output is the central 9x9 section of the input, but with certain transformations applied. For example, each output element is the sum of the corresponding input element and its adjacent elements modulo some number. But again, without concrete examples, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the output in Example 0 has 9 rows, and the input has 14 rows, perhaps each output row corresponds to a specific input row, but shifted or transformed. For example, output row 0 corresponds to input row 5, output row 1 to input row 6, etc. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input row 5 is [0, 0, 2, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output row 0 is [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are the reverse of certain input rows. For example, input row 8 is [0,5,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0]. Reverse gives [0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,5,0]. But output row 0 is [6,6,5,2,2,2,5,1,1]. Doesn't match.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I'll try to make a guess based on the structure. Since the output rows are 9 elements, perhaps each output row corresponds to a group of three input rows, and each element is the maximum value in that group. For example, output row 0 is the maximum of input rows 0-2 for each column. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example 0's input columns 0:\n\nRow0:5, row1:8, row2:8. Max is 8. But the output's first element is 6. Doesn't match. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of every three consecutive rows. For example, row0 + row1 + row2 = sum. For column 0: 5+8+8=21. Output first element is 6. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the difference between certain rows. For example, row1 - row0. Column0: 8-5=3. Output is 6. No.\n\nAnother Hail Mary: perhaps the output is the input's rows converted into a different base. For example, treating each row as a number in base 10 and converting to another base. But with varying lengths, this seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the digits of a larger number formed by the input rows. But this is too vague.\n\nI think I'm out of ideas. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to make an educated guess. Since the output rows are all 9 elements and seem to have a pattern where the middle is all 5s, perhaps the output is a 9x9 grid where each element is determined by the presence of certain numbers in the input's corresponding area, with 5s in the center and other numbers radiating out. For the test input, maybe the output has a similar structure with numbers like 7, 8, 1, 2, etc., arranged in a pattern similar to the training examples.\n\nLooking at the test input's first few rows, there are 5s in columns 10-12. There are 1s and 2s in early rows, 6s later, 8s and 7s towards the end. So perhaps the output's first row would start with the numbers around the 5s, maybe 6s and 2s, similar to Example 0.\n\nBut without the exact pattern, it's hard to produce the correct output. Given the examples, the output seems to have a symmetrical pattern with 5s in the middle. For the test input, the output might be:\n\n[7,7,5,1,1,1,5,8,8]\n[7,5,5,5,1,5,5,5,8]\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n[6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4]\n[6,6,5,5,5,5,5,4,4]\n[6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4]\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n[3,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,9]\n[3,3,5,2,2,2,5,9,9]\n\nThis is similar to Example 1's output, substituting numbers present in the test input like 7, 8, 6, etc. But this is just a guess based on the structure of the training examples. I'm not confident, but I'll go with something like this.",
