        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a grid of numbers, mostly 0s and 8s. The output grids have some 2s added. My goal is to find out under what conditions the 8s in the input are being replaced with 2s in the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a bunch of 8s forming some kind of shape. In the output, certain 8s turn into 2s. Let me compare the input and output for that example.\n\nLooking at the third row of Example 0's input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, ...]. The output changes the 4th element (index 4) to 2. Then the next row in input is [0, 8, 0, 0, 0...], which in output becomes [0,8,2,2,2...]. So the 8 at (row 2, column 1) is surrounded by 0s except maybe below. Wait, perhaps it's about the number of adjacent 8s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the original cell is 8 and is a \"border\" cell, i.e., adjacent to a 0. Let's check. For example, in Example 0's input row 2: the 8s are in positions 1,2,3. The output's row 2 has 8,8,8,2. So the last 8 in that row (position 3) is adjacent to 0 (position 4 is 0). Wait, but the next row in input has 8 at position 1, and then 0s. The output for that row has 8 followed by 2,2,2. Hmm. Maybe the 2s are placed where an 8 is adjacent (including diagonally?) to a 0.\n\nWait, let's take a specific cell. In Example 0's input, the cell at row 2, column 3 (value 8) is surrounded by 8s above, below, left, right? Let's check:\n\nInput row 2: [0,8,8,8,0,...] (row index 2 maybe, depending on how we count). Then row 3 has [0,8,0,0,...], so the cell below (row3, column1) is 8, but row3, column2 is 0. Wait, maybe if the cell is on the edge of the 8 region, it's turned into 2. Alternatively, maybe it's checking if the cell has any neighboring 0. For a cell to become 2, it must be an 8 and have at least one adjacent (including diagonal) 0.\n\nLet's test that. Take the first example's output. For example, in the input of example 0, row 2 (assuming 0-based or 1-based indexing?), let's say row 2 (third row) has cells with 8s at columns 1,2,3. The output changes column 4 (0-based index 3) to 2. Wait, the input's row 2 is [0,8,8,8,0,...]. The next row (row3) is [0,8,0,0,0...]. So the cell at row2, column3 (8) is adjacent to the 0 in row3, column3. So maybe that's why it's turned into a 2. Similarly, in row3 of input, the 8 at column1 is adjacent to 0s in column2 and column3. So in the output, those adjacent positions (but maybe not the 8 itself) are turned into 2s. Wait, no. The output for row3 is [0,8,2,2,2,...]. So the 8 in row3, column1 remains 8, but the cells to the right (columns 2,3,4) are 2s. Wait, but the input for row3, columns2 and 3 are 0s. So maybe the 2s are placed where there's a 0 in the input, but that's not the case. Because in the output, those 0s became 2s. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is different. Maybe the 2s are replacing 8s that are adjacent to 0s. Let me check. For example, in the output of example0, row2: the original 8s are at positions 1,2,3. The output changes position4 (which was 0) to 2. Wait, no, the input's row2, position4 is 0. So that's not replacing an 8. Hmm. So maybe I'm looking at this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in the positions that are adjacent (including diagonally) to 8s but were 0 in the input. So if a cell is 0 and adjacent to an 8, it becomes 2. But looking at example0's output: row2, column4 is 2. In input, that cell was 0. Let's check the neighbors. In input, cell (2,4) is 0. Its neighbors: (1,4) is 0, (3,4) is 0. Wait, but maybe in the original input, cell (2,4) is adjacent to 8s in row2, column3. So (2,4) is next to (2,3) which is 8. So maybe the rule is: cells that are 0 and adjacent (including diagonally?) to any 8 become 2. But in example0's output, the 2s are in cells that were 0 in the input. Wait, but in example0's input row3, columns2,3,4 are 0,0,0. The output for row3 changes those to 2,2,2. So those cells (originally 0) are turned into 2s if they are adjacent to 8s. Let's check their neighbors.\n\nIn input row3, column2 (0) has neighbors: row2, column1 (8), row2 column2 (8), row3 column1 (8), row4 column1 (8). So yes, adjacent to 8s. So those 0s are turned into 2s. So the transformation is: any 0 cell that is adjacent (possibly including diagonally) to an 8 becomes a 2. But wait, in example0's output, there are some 8s that become 2s. Wait, looking at example1's input and output: in example1's input, row2 is [0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0]. The output for row2 is [0,8,2,8,8,2,8,0]. The original 0s in positions 2 and 5 (columns) are replaced with 2s. Checking their neighbors: position2 in row2 is adjacent to 8s (row1's column2 and row2's column1 and 3). So that 0 becomes 2. So maybe the rule is: all 0s that are adjacent (in 8 directions) to any 8 are replaced with 2. And 8s remain 8, except when... Wait, but looking back at example0's output, there are some 8s that are turned into 2s. Wait in example0's output, row3, column1 is 8 (same as input), but row4, column2 is 8 in input and output. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check example0's input and output again.\n\nWait example0's input row3: [0,8,0,0,0,...]. Output row3: [0,8,2,2,2,...]. So the 8 remains, but the 0s next to it become 2s. So the 8s are not changing. Wait, but in example0's output, there's a row where 8s are replaced with 2s? Let me check again. Let's take output row5: [0,8,8,2,2,0...]. Input row5 is [0,8,8,0,0...]. So the 0s in input row5 columns3 and 4 become 2s. So the 8s remain 8s. Wait, but in example1's input, the output has 8s remaining and 0s turning into 2s. So the pattern seems to be that any 0 cell that is adjacent (in 8 directions) to at least one 8 becomes a 2. But why are there 8s in the output? Because the 8s are not being changed. Wait, but in example0's output, in row3, the 8 is still there. So the 8s stay, and the 0s adjacent to 8s become 2s. So the transformation is: replace all 0s that are adjacent (any direction, including diagonally) to at least one 8 with 2. All other cells (0s not adjacent to 8, and 8s) remain as they are. \n\nTesting this with example0: the 0s that are next to 8s become 2s. So in the input, wherever there is a 0 next to an 8, it becomes 2. Let's verify. For example, in example1's input row3: [0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0]. The 0s here are positions 2,4,5. The output changes positions2,4,5 to 2,2,2. Let's check their neighbors. Position2 in row3: neighbors are row2's 8, row3's 8 (position1) and 8 (position3). So yes, adjacent to 8s. So 0 becomes 2. Similarly for other positions.\n\nNow looking at example2's input. The output has some 2s. For instance, input row2 is [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0]. The output row2 is [0,2,2,8,2,8,0,0]. The original 0s in columns1,2,4 are turned into 2s. Checking their neighbors: column1 in row2 is adjacent to row1's column1 (0), row2's column2 (0), row3's column1 (0). Wait, but row1 is [0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0], so row1, column1 is 0. Hmm, perhaps I need to check all 8 directions. For row2, column1: neighbors would be row1 column0 (0), row1 column1 (0), row1 column2 (8), row2 column0 (0), row2 column2 (0), row3 column0 (0), row3 column1 (0), row3 column2 (0). Wait, in input, row2 column1 is 0. Its neighbors: row1 column2 is 8 (since input row1 is [0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0]. So column2 in row1 is 8. So row2 column1 is adjacent to 8 (row1 column2). Therefore, it becomes 2. Similarly, row2 column2 (0) is adjacent to row1 column1 (8), row1 column2 (8), row1 column3 (8), row2 column1 (0), row2 column3 (8), etc. So yes, adjacent to 8s. So it becomes 2. Row2 column4 (0) in input becomes 2. Its neighbors: row1 column3 (8), row1 column4 (8), row1 column5 (8), row2 column3 (8), row2 column5 (8), row3 column3 (8), row3 column4 (8), row3 column5 (8). So yes, adjacent to many 8s, thus becomes 2.\n\nSo this seems to fit. The rule is: replace all 0s that are adjacent (in any of 8 directions) to at least one 8 with 2. All other cells remain the same. So the 8s stay as 8s, 0s not adjacent to 8s stay as 0s, and 0s adjacent to 8s become 2s.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input.\n\nLet's look at the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWe need to process each cell in this grid. For each 0, check if any of the 8 surrounding cells has an 8. If yes, replace with 2. Otherwise, leave as 0. The 8s remain 8s.\n\nLet's go row by row.\n\nRow 0 (all zeros except maybe edges? The first row is all 0s. The neighbors for these 0s: the second row's cells. For example, row0 column2: check if any adjacent cells (row0's neighbors in row1, etc. But row1 is all 0s except in some columns. Let's check each cell.\n\nRow0: all 0s. The cells in row0 can only be adjacent to row1's cells. Since row1 is all 0s (except later rows?), row0's cells have no adjacent 8s. So all remain 0.\n\nRow1: same as row0. All 0s. Check adjacent cells. The row above (row0) is 0s. The row below (row2) has a 8 in column2. So for row1, column2, check if any adjacent cells (up/down/left/right/diagonal). For example, row1 column2 is adjacent to row2 column2 (8). So row1 column2's cell (0) is adjacent to 8. So it becomes 2. Similarly, row1 column1 and 3 may be adjacent to 8s. Let's check each cell in row1.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nFor each cell in row1:\n\nCheck all 8 neighbors. For example, cell (1,2) (row1, column2) is adjacent to row2, column2 (8). So this cell becomes 2. What about cell (1,1)? Its neighbors include row2, column0 (0), row2 column1 (0), row2 column2 (8). So cell (1,1) is adjacent to 8 (row2, column2). Wait, no: cell (1,1) is adjacent to row0 column0, row0 column1, row0 column2, row1 column0, row1 column2, row2 column0, row2 column1, row2 column2. Wait, row2 column2 is 8, which is diagonally adjacent to cell (1,1). So yes, cell (1,1) is adjacent to an 8. So it becomes 2. Similarly, cell (1,3) is adjacent to row2 column2 (8). So row1, column3 would become 2. So in row1, columns1,2,3 may become 2s. Let's check.\n\nBut wait, the test input's row1 is all 0s. The row below (row2) has 8 in column2. So for row1's cells:\n\nFor cell (1,0) in row1: adjacent cells are row0 (all 0s), row2 columns0 and 1. row2 column0 is 0. So no 8s. So remains 0.\n\ncell (1,1): adjacent to row2 column2 (8) diagonally. So yes, becomes 2.\n\ncell (1,2): adjacent to row2 column2 (8) directly below. So 2.\n\ncell (1,3): adjacent to row2 column2 (8) diagonally (row2 column2 is 8, row1 column3 is adjacent to row2 column2. So yes. So becomes 2.\n\ncells (1,4) and beyond: their adjacent cells in row2 are 0s (row2 columns4 etc. So no 8s. So remain 0.\n\nSo row1 would become [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nRow2: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe 8 remains. The 0s around it may become 2s. For example, cell (2,0): adjacent to row1's 0s and row3's 0s. So no 8s. Remains 0.\n\ncell (2,1): adjacent to row1's 2 (but 2 is not 8), row2's 8 (cell 2,2). So yes, adjacent to 8. So becomes 2.\n\ncell (2,3): adjacent to cell (2,2) (8). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (2,4) and others: check if adjacent to any 8. For cell (2,4), adjacent to row3 column3 (0) etc. No 8s. So remains 0.\n\nSo row2 becomes [0,2,8,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow3: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nOriginal cells: 0s at columns0,1,3,4,5,8,9,10. 8s at columns2,6,7.\n\nFor cell (3,0): adjacent cells in row2, columns0 (0), 1 (2), etc. No 8s. So remains 0.\n\ncell (3,1): adjacent to row2 column2 (8) (diagonally). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (3,3): adjacent to row3 column2 (8) (left neighbor). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (3,4): adjacent to row3 column2 (8)? No. The cell (3,4) is two steps right of column2. So adjacent cells are row3 column3 (0), row4 column3 (0). So no 8s. Wait, but row3 has 8s at column2,6,7.\n\ncell (3,5): adjacent to row3 column6 (8)? Yes, to the right. So cell (3,5) is adjacent to column6 (8) diagonally (row3, column6 is two cells away, no. Direct neighbors: cell (3,5) is adjacent to (3,4), (3,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). So (3,5) is adjacent to (3,6) which is 8. So yes. So becomes 2.\n\nSimilarly, cell (3,8): adjacent to row3 column7 (8). So becomes 2.\n\nSo for row3:\n\nOriginal: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nConverted:\n\n[0,2,8,2,0,2,8,8,2,0,0]\n\nWait, let's check each cell:\n\ncell (3,0): 0, adjacent to row2 columns0 (0), row2 column1 (2), row3 column1 (0). So no 8s. So remains 0.\n\ncell (3,1): adjacent to row2 column2 (8) diagonally. So becomes 2.\n\ncell (3,2): 8, remains.\n\ncell (3,3): adjacent to row3 column2 (8). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (3,4): adjacent to row3 column3 (now 2) and row4 column4 (0). So no 8s. Remains 0.\n\ncell (3,5): adjacent to row3 column6 (8). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (3,6): 8, remains.\n\ncell (3,7): 8, remains.\n\ncell (3,8): adjacent to row3 column7 (8). So becomes 2.\n\ncells (3,9) and 10: no adjacent 8s. So remain 0.\n\nSo row3 becomes [0,2,8,2,0,2,8,8,2,0,0].\n\nRow4: [0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nOriginal cells: 0s at columns0,1,3,5,8,9,10. 8s at 2,4,7.\n\nFor each 0:\n\ncell (4,0): adjacent to row3 column0 (0), row3 column1 (2), row4 column1 (0). No 8s. Remains 0.\n\ncell (4,1): adjacent to row3 column2 (8) (diagonally). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (4,3): adjacent to row4 column2 (8) (left neighbor). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (4,5): adjacent to row4 column4 (8) (left). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (4,8): adjacent to row4 column7 (8) (left). So becomes 2.\n\ncells (4,9) and 10: no adjacent 8s. Remain 0.\n\nSo row4 becomes [0,2,8,2,8,2,0,8,2,0,0].\n\nRow5: [0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nOriginal 0s at columns0,1,5,6,8,9,10. 8s at 2,3,4,7.\n\nCheck 0s:\n\ncell (5,0): adjacent to row4 column0 (0), row5 column1 (0). No 8s. Remains 0.\n\ncell (5,1): adjacent to row4 column2 (8) (diagonally). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (5,5): adjacent to row5 column4 (8) (left). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (5,6): adjacent to row5 column5 (0), row5 column7 (8) (right), and row4 column6 (0). So cell (5,6) is adjacent to row5 column7 (8). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (5,8): adjacent to row5 column7 (8). So becomes 2.\n\nOther cells (5,9,10) remain 0.\n\nSo row5 becomes [0,2,8,8,8,2,2,8,2,0,0].\n\nRow6: [0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,0]\n\nOriginal 0s at columns0,1,6,9,10. 8s elsewhere.\n\ncell (6,0): adjacent to row5 column0 (0). No 8s. Remains 0.\n\ncell (6,1): adjacent to row5 column2 (8) (diagonally). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (6,6): adjacent to row6 column5 (8) (left), row6 column7 (8) (right), row5 column6 (2), etc. So adjacent to 8s. So becomes 2.\n\ncells (6,9,10): adjacent to row7's columns which may have 8s. For cell (6,9): adjacent to row7 column8 (8). So becomes 2. Similarly, cell (6,10): adjacent to row7 column9 (0). So remains 0.\n\nSo row6 becomes [0,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,2,0].\n\nWait, let's check:\n\ncell (6,0): remains 0.\n\ncell (6,1): adjacent to row5 column2 (8) (two rows below? No. Wait, row6 is the seventh row. So cell (6,1) is in row6. Its neighbors are row5's cells (row5 is row6 -1). So cell (6,1) is adjacent to row5 column0 (0), row5 column1 (2), row5 column2 (8) (diagonally). So yes, adjacent to 8. So becomes 2.\n\ncell (6,6): adjacent to 8s on both left and right. So 0 becomes 2.\n\ncell (6,9): adjacent to row7 column8 (8) (diagonally?), row6 column8 (8) (left). So yes, adjacent to 8. So becomes 2.\n\nSo row6 becomes [0,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,2,0].\n\nRow7: [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0]\n\nAll 8s except first two and last two. 0s at columns0,1,9,10.\n\ncell (7,0): adjacent to row6 column0 (0). No 8s. Remains 0.\n\ncell (7,1): adjacent to row6 column2 (8) (diagonally). So becomes 2.\n\ncells (7,9): adjacent to row7 column8 (8) (left). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (7,10): adjacent to row7 column9 (2), which is a 0 in input but in output would be 2. But wait, in input it's 0. So cell (7,10) is adjacent to row7 column9 (0) and row8 column9 (0). So no 8s. Remains 0.\n\nSo row7 becomes [0,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,0].\n\nRow8 is all 0s. Their neighbors: row7's cells. For example, row8 column2: adjacent to row7 column1 (2), row7 column2 (8). So cell (8,2) is adjacent to 8. So becomes 2. Similarly for other cells.\n\nBut row8 in the test input is:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nCheck each 0 in row8:\n\ncell (8,0): adjacent to row7 column0 (0). No 8s. Remains 0.\n\ncell (8,1): adjacent to row7 column0 (0), row7 column1 (2). No 8s. Remains 0.\n\ncell (8,2): adjacent to row7 column2 (8). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (8,3): adjacent to row7 column3 (8). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (8,4): adjacent to row7 column4 (8). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (8,5): adjacent to row7 column5 (8). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (8,6): adjacent to row7 column6 (8). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (8,7): adjacent to row7 column7 (8). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (8,8): adjacent to row7 column8 (8). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (8,9): adjacent to row7 column8 (8) (left). So becomes 2.\n\ncell (8,10): adjacent to row7 column9 (2) (but 2 is not 8). So remains 0.\n\nSo row8 becomes [0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0].\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe output grid should be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,2,8,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,2,8,2,0,2,8,8,2,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,2,8,2,8,2,0,8,2,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,2,8,8,8,2,2,8,2,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,2,0]\n\nRow7: [0,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0]\n\nLet me double-check some key cells.\n\nFor example, row8: cells 2-9 should be 2, except cell10 which is 0. So yes.\n\nRow5: column5 and 6 are 2. Because adjacent to 8s.\n\nRow7, column9: in input it's 0, but in output becomes 2 because adjacent to row7's column8 (8).\n\nYes, this seems correct.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a grid of numbers, mostly 0s and 8s, and the output replaces some 0s with 2s. Let me see where those 2s are appearing.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has several rows with 8s forming some shape. The output adds 2s around them. For instance, in the third row of input, [0,8,8,8,0,...], the output becomes [0,8,8,8,2,0,...]. So the 2 is next to the 8s. But maybe it's not just adjacent. Let me check another part. In the fourth row of input, [0,8,0,0,0...] becomes [0,8,2,2,2...]. Oh, so the 0s that are adjacent to 8s are being turned into 2s? Wait, but maybe there's more to it. Like, maybe the 2s are filling in areas that are enclosed by 8s? Or perhaps they're forming a border around the 8s.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a sort of loop or structure. The output adds 2s in some positions. For example, the third row input is [0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0], output is [0,8,2,8,2,2,8,0]. So where there were 0s between 8s, they become 2s. Maybe the 2s are replacing 0s that are surrounded by 8s on certain sides. Or perhaps it's about the number of adjacent 8s. Let's see. In the fourth row of Example 1's input: [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0] becomes [0,2,2,8,2,8,8,0]. The 0s next to the 8s are 2s now.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any 0 that is adjacent (including diagonally?) to an 8 becomes a 2. But looking at Example 0's first output row, the 2 is after three 8s. Let me check adjacency. The input row is [0,8,8,8,0...], the output adds a 2 in the fifth position. The fifth position in the input was 0. The adjacent cells would be the fourth position (8) and maybe the cells above and below. But since it's a grid, maybe we have to check all four directions (up, down, left, right) for each 0. If a 0 is adjacent to an 8, then it's replaced by 2. Let's test this.\n\nTake Example 0's third row input: [0,8,8,8,0...]. The fifth element is 0. To its left is 8 (fourth position), so yes, adjacent. So it becomes 2. Then in the fourth row of input: [0,8,0,0,0...] becomes [0,8,2,2,2...]. The 0s here are adjacent to the 8 on the left. So the 0s in positions 2,3,4 (if considering 0-based or 1-based?) So the 0s after the 8 are being turned to 2s. Wait, maybe it's a matter of being adjacent in any direction. But in that case, the 0s next to 8s in any direction (up, down, left, right) would become 2s. But looking at the output, sometimes 0s are turned into 2s even if they are not directly adjacent. Wait, maybe it's more about the 0s that are on the \"outside\" of the 8 shapes. Or maybe it's a cellular automaton-like step where 0s adjacent to 8s are replaced, but then the next layer is also replaced? No, because in the examples, the outputs don't have multiple layers of 2s. So perhaps the rule is that any 0 that is adjacent (orthogonally) to an 8 is replaced by 2.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the fourth row has [0,2,2,8,2,8,8,0]. The original input had [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0]. So the first three 0s are turned into 2,2,8. Wait, no. The input row is [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0], output is [0,2,2,8,2,8,8,0]. So the first three 0s: first 0 becomes 0 (still 0?), second and third 0s become 2. But why? Let me check their adjacency. The second 0 (position 1) is adjacent to the 8 in position 3 (two cells to the right), but that's two steps away. So maybe not. Wait, maybe it's adjacent diagonally. For example, in the input row [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0], the second 0 (position 1) is adjacent to the 8 in position 3? No, in a grid, adjacency is usually up, down, left, right. So the 0s in positions 0,1,2 (columns 0,1,2) of row 4. Are any of these adjacent to an 8? The 8 is in position 3 (column 3). So column 3 is 8. So column 2 (0) is adjacent (left) to 8. So that 0 would be turned into 2. Then the 0 in column 1 would not be adjacent. But in the output, columns 1 and 2 are 2. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the adjacency includes diagonal. Let's see: if the 0 is in (row 4, column 1), then diagonally adjacent would be (row 3, column 0?), but maybe in the grid, the 0 in row 4, column 1 is adjacent to the 8 in row 3, column 3? That's not possible. Wait, perhaps the 8 in the same row, previous columns. Maybe the 0s are part of a connected region that's adjacent to 8s. Or maybe the 0s are enclosed by 8s on two sides. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to replace 0s that are to the right of 8s. Wait, looking at Example 0's third row input: [0,8,8,8,0...], the output has 2 in the fifth position. So after the three 8s, there's a 0 that becomes 2. Maybe the rule is that 0s immediately to the right of 8s become 2. But in the fourth row input: [0,8,0,0,0...], the output is [0,8,2,2,2...]. So the 0s after the 8 in the same row become 2s. But then in the fifth row input: [0,8,8,0,0...], output is [0,8,8,2,2...]. So the 0s after the 8s in the same row are 2s. That seems to fit. Then in Example 1, the fourth row input: [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0] becomes [0,2,2,8,2,8,8,0]. So the 0s to the left and right of the 8s are replaced by 2s? Wait, the first 0s in that row are positions 0,1,2. The 8 is at position 3. So the 0s to the left (position 2) would be adjacent, but positions 0 and 1 are further left. But in the output, positions 1 and 2 are 2s. Hmm, maybe the 0s are being replaced if they are adjacent to an 8 either on the left, right, above, or below. So in that row, the 0 at position 2 (column 2) is adjacent to the 8 on the right (column 3), so it's turned into 2. Then the 0 at position 1 (column 1) is adjacent to the 0 at position 2, which is now a 2? No, because the transformation is done in one step. So maybe the 0s adjacent to 8s in any direction (up, down, left, right) become 2s. Let's check Example 1's fourth row input again. The 8 is at column 3. So any 0 adjacent to that 8 (left, right, up, down). The row is row 4 (assuming rows start at 0). The cell at row 4, column 3 is 8. The cells around it:\n\n- row 4, column 2: 0 (left) \u2192 becomes 2\n- row 4, column 4: 0 (right) \u2192 becomes 2?\n- row 3, column 3: 8 (above)\n- row 5, column 3: 0 (below, but row 5 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], so 0)\n\nSo in the input row 4, column 3's adjacent cells are 0 (left), 0 (right), 8 (up), 0 (down). So the left and right 0s would become 2s. But in the output, the row is [0,2,2,8,2,8,8,0]. So columns 1 and 2 are 2s, which were originally 0s. How do they become 2s? Column 1: 0. What's adjacent to it? Let's see:\n\nFor row 4, column 1 (original 0):\n\n- Up: row 3, column 1 is 0\n- Down: row 5, column 1 is 0\n- Left: column 0 is 0\n- Right: column 2 is 0\n\nNone of these are 8s. So why is it a 2 in the output? Hmm, maybe there's a different rule here. Maybe the 2s are replacing 0s that are adjacent to 8s in a diagonal direction. Let's check that. For row 4, column 1:\n\n- Diagonally up-left: row 3, column 0 (which is 8 in row 3, column 0?) Let's look at the input for Example 1. The input is:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 1: [0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0]\nRow 2: [0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0]\nRow 3: [0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0]\nRow 4: [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0]\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo for row 4, column 1 (input is 0). Diagonally up-left would be row 3, column 0: which is 8? Row 3 starts with 0, then 8. Wait, row 3 is [0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0]. So column 0 is 0, column 1 is 8. So diagonally up-left from row4, column1 is row3, column0: 0. Diagonally up-right: row3, column2: 0. Diagonally down-left: row5, column0: 0. Diagonally down-right: row5, column2: 0. So no 8s in diagonals. Then why is row4, column1 in output 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that 0s that are part of regions enclosed by 8s become 2s. But in Example 0, the output seems to have 2s around the 8s, but not filling the entire enclosed area. For example, in Example 0's third row, the 2 is after the 8s. Maybe it's a matter of proximity, not enclosure.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is to replace 0s that are to the right of 8s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's third row: [0,8,8,8,0...] \u2192 [0,8,8,8,2...]. The 0 after the last 8 becomes 2. The fourth row [0,8,0,0,0...] \u2192 [0,8,2,2,2...]. The 0s after the 8 are all 2s. So maybe the rule is that any 0 that is to the right of an 8 in the same row becomes a 2. Similarly, perhaps any 0 below an 8 in the same column. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example 1's fourth row input: [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0], the 8s are at positions 3,5,6. The output has 2s in positions 1,2,4. So position 3 is 8, position4 (0) becomes 2. So to the right of the 8 at position3, the 0 becomes 2. Then position5 is 8, and position6 is 8, so no 0s to the right. But positions1 and 2 are 2s. How would that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the 0s that are adjacent to 8s either on the left, right, above, or below. So in Example 1's fourth row, column1 is 0. Let's check if it's adjacent to any 8 in any direction. The cell above (row3, column1) is 8. Because row3 is [0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0], so column1 is 8. So row4, column1 is below that 8. So the 0 is adjacent below an 8, so it becomes 2. Similarly, row4, column2 (0) is adjacent to the 8 in row3, column3 (which is 8 in row3, column3: yes. So row3, column3 is 8. So row4, column2 is below that 8. So the 0 becomes 2. That makes sense. Then row4, column4 (0) is adjacent to the 8 in row4, column3 (8), so becomes 2. So the output for row4 becomes [0,2,2,8,2,8,8,0]. That fits.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: for each 0 in the grid, if there's an 8 in any of the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right), then replace the 0 with a 2. That's the pattern. So the transformation is replacing 0s adjacent to 8s with 2s.\n\nLet's verify with Example 2. The input has a row [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], output becomes [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]. Wait, no, looking at Example 2's input and output. The input is:\n\nExample 2 input row 1: [0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0] \u2192 output same.\n\nRow2 input: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0] \u2192 output [0,2,2,8,2,8,0,0]. So the 0s in columns1,2,4 become 2s. Let's check their adjacency:\n\nRow2, column1: 0. Adjacent cells: up is row1, column1 (8), so yes \u2192 2.\n\nRow2, column2: 0. Adjacent up (row1, column2 (8)), so 2.\n\nRow2, column4: 0. Adjacent left (row2, column3 (8)), so 2.\n\nYes, that fits the rule.\n\nSo the pattern is: replace all 0s that are orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, right) to any 8 with 2. So the test input should be processed by checking each 0 and seeing if any of its four neighbors are 8. If yes, replace with 2.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0]\nRow4: [0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0]\nRow5: [0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,0,0,0]\nRow6: [0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,0]\nRow7: [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0]\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWe need to process each 0 and check if it's adjacent to an 8. Let's go row by row.\n\nRow0 and row1: all zeros. Their adjacent cells (rows below) are also zeros except row2. But in row0, the cells below (row1) are 0. So no 0 in row0 or row1 will be adjacent to 8. So they remain 0.\n\nRow2: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Let's check each 0:\n\n- row2, column0: 0. Adjacent cells: right is column1 (0), down is row3, column0 (0). No 8 \u2192 remains 0.\n\n- row2, column1: 0. Right is 8 (row2, column2). So adjacent to 8 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\n- row2, columns3-10: 0s. For column3: adjacent left is 8 (column2). So becomes 2. Columns4-10: their lefts are 0, and downs may or may not. For example, row2, column3 (0) is left of 0, but right of 8 (column2). Wait, the cell at row2, column3: left is column2 (8), so yes. So row2, column3 becomes 2. Then columns4 and beyond: check their adjacent. For column4, adjacent left is 0 (column3, but row2, column3 is 0 in input, but after transformation, in input it's 0. Wait, the input is the original. So the transformation is based on the original input. So in row2, column3 is 0 in input. So column4's left is 0, and the other adjacents. So row2, column4: check if any adjacent cell in original input has 8. The cells to check are up (row1, column4: 0), down (row3, column4: 0), left (row2, column3: 0), right (row2, column5:0). So no 8 \u2192 remains 0. Similarly for other columns. So row2's output would be [0,2,8,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow3: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0].\n\nCheck each 0:\n\n- column0: 0. Adjacent right (column1:0), down (row4, column0:0) \u2192 no 8 \u2192 0.\n\n- column1:0. Adjacent right (column2:8) \u2192 becomes 2.\n\n- column3:0. Check adjacents: left (column2:8) \u2192 becomes 2. Also, down (row4, column3:0), up (row2, column3:0), right (column4:0). So because left is 8 \u2192 2.\n\n- column4:0. Adjacent left (3:0), right (5:0), up (row2,4:0), down (row4,4:8. Oh, row4, column4 is 8. So yes. So column4's down is 8 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\n- column5:0. Adjacent left (4:0), right (6:0), up (row2,5:0), down (row4,5:0). No 8 \u2192 0.\n\n- column6:8 (stays).\n\n- column8,9,10:0. For column8: adjacent left (7:8) \u2192 becomes 2. Column9: left (8:0), right (10:0). But row3, column8 is 8 in input. So column9: left is 0 (after transformation?), no. Wait, original input: row3, column7 and 8 are 8. So column8's left is column7 (8), so row3, column8 is 0 in input. Wait, input row3: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0]. So columns 6 and 7 are 8. Column8 is 0. So adjacent cells for column8 (0) are left (column7:8), so becomes 2. Column9 and 10: adjacent left (8 and 9:0). So column9's left is 0 (column8:0 in input, but after column8 becomes 2, but transformation is based on original input. So column9: left is 0 (original). So no 8 adjacent. So row3's output:\n\n[0,2,8,2,2,0,8,8,2,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0].\n\nCheck each 0:\n\n- column0:0. Adjacent right (1:0), down (row5,0:0) \u2192 0.\n\n- column1:0. Adjacent right (2:8) \u2192 becomes 2.\n\n- column3:0. Adjacent up (row3,3:0), down (row5,3:8). Wait, row5's input is [0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,0,0,0]. So row5, column3 is 8. So row4, column3: down is 8 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\n- column5:0. Adjacent left (4:8) \u2192 becomes 2.\n\n- column6:0. Adjacent left (5:0), right (7:8) \u2192 becomes 2.\n\n- column8:0. Adjacent left (7:8) \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nColumns 9 and 10:0, no adjacent 8s \u2192 0.\n\nSo row4's output:\n\n[0,2,8,2,8,2,2,8,2,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,0,0,0].\n\nCheck each 0:\n\n- column0:0 \u2192 remains.\n\n- column1:0. Adjacent right (2:8) \u2192 2.\n\n- column5:0. Adjacent left (4:8) \u2192 2.\n\n- column6:0. Adjacent left (5:0), right (7:8) \u2192 2.\n\n- column8:0. Adjacent left (7:8) \u2192 2.\n\nSo row5 output:\n\n[0,2,8,8,8,2,2,8,2,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,0].\n\nCheck each 0:\n\n- column0:0 \u2192 0.\n\n- column1:0. Adjacent right (2:8) \u2192 2.\n\n- column6:0. Adjacents: left (5:0), right (7:8) \u2192 2.\n\n- columns9,10:0 \u2192 0.\n\nSo row6 output:\n\n[0,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0].\n\nCheck each 0:\n\n- column0:0 \u2192 0.\n\n- column1:0. Adjacent right (2:8) \u2192 2.\n\n- columns9,10:0 \u2192 0.\n\nSo row7's output:\n\n[0,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow8: all 0s. Check adjacents. The row above is row7, which has 8s. For example, row8, column0:0. Adjacent up (row7,0:0). So no. Row8, column1:0. Adjacent up (row7,1:2, which was original 0, but in original input, row7, column1 is 0. So no 8. Wait, in the original input, row7 is [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0]. So row8, column2: adjacent up is row7, column2 (8). So row8, column2's up is 8 \u2192 becomes 2. Similarly, row8, columns3-8: adjacent up (row7, columns3-8 are 8s). So those 0s in row8, columns2-8 (except 9 and 10) become 2s. But row8 in input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So row8, column2: up is 8 \u2192 2. Column3: up is 8 \u2192 2. Columns4-8: same. So row8's output becomes [0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0].\n\nWait, but row8 is the last row (row8), and the row below is non-existent. So for row8, each 0 is checked against the cells above (row7), left, right, and below (none). So columns 2-8 in row8 have up as 8s, so they become 2s. So row8 becomes:\n\n[0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0]\n\nPutting all together, the output rows are:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 2, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 2, 8, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 2, 8, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nLet me verify row8 again. For example, row8, column2 is 0 in input. Up is row7, column2 which is 8 \u2192 becomes 2. Columns3-8 in row8: up are 8s. So they become 2s. So row8's output is [0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0]. That makes sense.\n\nSo that's the final output.",
