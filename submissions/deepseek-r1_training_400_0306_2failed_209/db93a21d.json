        "cot_1": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids based on the training examples. Let me start by looking at each example and see what changes happen from input to output.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nIn the input, there are blocks of 9s at the top right and bottom middle. The output has 3s surrounding those 9s, creating a sort of border. Also, there are 1s appearing in the lower middle area. It looks like the 9s are being framed by 3s, and then there's a layer of 1s around or near them. Maybe the 3s are a first layer and 1s are a second layer, expanding outward?\n\nExample 1:\nThe input has blocks of 9s in the upper middle and lower right. The output adds 3s around the 9s again, and there's a new 1s area near the bottom. The 3s seem to form a border around the 9s, and the 1s are perhaps another layer further out. Also, some areas with 9s in the input have 3s added adjacent to them, even if there were zeros before.\n\nExample 2:\nHere, the input has 9s in the top left and middle right. The output adds 3s around those 9s, and 1s in some areas. The 3s form a kind of frame, and the 1s are in regions that were previously zeros but adjacent to the 3s. There's a structure where the 3s are immediately around the 9s, and then 1s are around the 3s or in other connected regions.\n\nExample 3:\nThe input has 9s in the upper right and lower middle. The output shows 3s around the 9s and 1s in other areas. Again, the 3s border the 9s, and the 1s are in adjacent regions. Also, some of the 3s form pathways connecting different sections, maybe following certain directions.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern seems to involve adding layers around the 9s. The first layer (immediately adjacent to 9s) becomes 3, then the next layer (adjacent to 3s) becomes 1. But how exactly is this determined?\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, sometimes the 3s are not just a single layer. For example, in Example 0's output, rows 0 and 1 have 3s before the 9s. Also, in Example 3, there are 3s extending further out. Maybe the 3s are part of a larger structure that connects different 9 blocks, forming a sort of frame or path between them. The 1s might be areas that are adjacent to the 3s but not part of the main structures.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the Manhattan distance from the 9s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, the 9s are at positions (0,6), (0,7), (1,6), (1,7), (7,1), (7,2), (8,1), (8,2). The 3s around them might be at a distance of 1 or 2. But in the output, the 3s are in positions adjacent to the 9s and also form lines extending downwards. Maybe it's not just a simple distance, but a directional expansion.\n\nAnother angle: the 9s might represent some sort of \"source\" blocks, and the 3s and 1s are generated by propagating outward, but with different rules. For example, 3s could be created in all orthogonal directions from the 9s, and then 1s are created in the next layer. But looking at Example 0's output, the 3s are not just around each 9, but form a continuous area connecting the two 9 clusters. So maybe the algorithm connects all 9 clusters with 3s, filling in the space between them, and then adds 1s around those 3s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are forming a frame around each group of 9s and also connecting them via the shortest path. For instance, in Example 0, the two groups of 9s are at the top right and bottom middle. The 3s form a vertical line between them. Then the 1s are in regions adjacent to the 3s but not overlapping.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, the 9s are in the upper middle and lower right. The output shows 3s connecting these regions, creating a sort of path. The 1s are then surrounding those 3s. Similarly, in Example 3, the 9s are in upper right and lower middle, and the 3s form a path connecting them, with 1s around.\n\nSo the pattern might be:\n\n1. Identify all 9 blocks (contiguous regions of 9s).\n2. Create a path of 3s connecting these blocks, possibly via the shortest path in some direction.\n3. Then, create a layer of 1s around the 3s.\n\nBut how is the path determined? For Example 0, the two 9 groups are vertically aligned. The 3s between them form a vertical line. In Example 1, the 9s are in different areas, and the 3s form a sort of horizontal and vertical path. It might be that the 3s are drawn in a way that connects the 9 blocks by moving along rows and columns, filling in the necessary cells with 3s. Then the 1s are added around the entire 3s structure, perhaps in all adjacent cells that are not already 3s or 9s.\n\nAnother observation: in the outputs, the original 9s remain, but surrounded by 3s. Then, the 3s are in a sort of cross or plus shape around the 9s and connecting them. The 1s are then in the next layer around the 3s.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output again: the 3s are not only adjacent to the 9s but also forming a vertical line down from the top 9s to the bottom ones. The bottom 9s in the input are at rows 7 and 8, column 1 and 2. The 3s around them are in rows 7-8, columns 0 and 3. Then, between the top and bottom 9s, the 3s form a vertical line in column 5 (rows 0-2) and a horizontal line in row 6 (columns 0-3). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the 3s form a border around each 9 block, then connect via a straight line between them, expanding into the grid.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation might be a cellular automaton-like process where 3s are placed in cells that are adjacent to 9s, and then 1s are placed adjacent to 3s, but this doesn't fully explain the connected paths.\n\nAnother approach: check for each cell in the output how it's transformed from the input. For cells that were 0 in the input and became 3 in the output: are they adjacent to 9s? In Example 0, the top 9s are at (0,6-7) and (1,6-7). The 3s in (0,5) and (1,5) are adjacent to the 9s. Similarly, (0,8) and (1,8) are adjacent to the top 9s. Then, the 3s in (7,0) and (8,0) are adjacent to the bottom 9s. Also, there's a vertical line of 3s in rows 6-9, columns 0-3, which connects to the bottom 9s. So maybe 3s are placed in all cells adjacent to 9s, and then those 3s propagate further in certain directions.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the 3s extend beyond immediate adjacency. For example, in row 2, column 5 is 3. That's two steps away from the top 9s. So maybe there's a two-step process: first, 3s are placed adjacent to 9s, then another layer of 3s adjacent to existing 3s, but only in certain directions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the 3s could be forming a diamond shape around each 9 block. For example, expanding in all directions up to a certain distance. But looking at Example 0, the 3s around the top 9s are in positions that are adjacent and then some. Maybe the 3s are generated by expanding in all four directions (up, down, left, right) from each 9 cell, but only once. Then, any cell that is adjacent to a 9 becomes a 3. Then, the 1s are adjacent to 3s.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the 3s are not only adjacent. For instance, the bottom 9s are in rows 7 and 8, columns 1 and 2. The 3s in rows 7-8, columns 0 and 3 (left and right), and rows 6 and 9, columns 0-3 (forming a frame). So maybe it's a two-layer expansion: first layer adjacent, then another layer adjacent to that. But in that case, why are some cells 3 and others 1?\n\nAlternatively, the 3s form a border around the 9 blocks, and also any lines connecting different 9 blocks. The 1s are then the next layer out. For example, in Example 0, the two 9 blocks are connected via a vertical line of 3s. The 3s could be forming a path that connects all 9 blocks, and then 1s are the surrounding area.\n\nAnother possibility is that the transformation is based on some sort of maze or pathfinding algorithm, where the 3s are the path between 9 blocks, and the 1s are the areas adjacent to that path. But how to determine the path's direction?\n\nAlternatively, the 3s and 1s represent different levels of distance from the 9s. For example, 3s are at distance 1, and 1s at distance 2. But in Example 0, some cells at distance 2 from 9s are 3s. Like the cell (0,5) is adjacent to (0,6), which is a 9. So that's distance 1. But (0,8) is adjacent to (0,7), which is a 9. Also distance 1. Then why are there 3s in row 2, column 5? That's two steps down from the top 9s. Maybe it's a different direction of expansion.\n\nWait, maybe the 3s are formed by expanding in a specific direction from the 9 blocks. For example, expanding downward from the top 9s and upward from the bottom 9s until they meet. Let me look at Example 0 again. The top 9s are in rows 0-1, columns 6-7. The bottom 9s are in rows 7-8, columns 1-2. The 3s between them are in rows 6-9, columns 0-3. Wait, maybe the 3s are filling the area between the two 9 clusters by expanding towards each other. For instance, from the top 9s, expand down and to the left, and from the bottom 9s, expand up and to the left, creating a connected region of 3s.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s are generated by moving in a certain direction (like down, then left) from each 9 cluster. Then, the 1s are adjacent to those 3s. But this seems a bit arbitrary.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for cells that are 3 in the output but 0 in the input. Are they adjacent to 9s? In Example 0, yes. For example, (0,5) is adjacent to (0,6) which is 9. Similarly, (7,0) is adjacent to (7,1) which is 9. Then, cells adjacent to those 3s become 1s. For example, in Example 0, row 3, column 6-7 are 0s in input but become 3,3, etc. Wait, no. Wait the output for example 0's third row (index 2) has 0s except for columns 5-8 being 3. Wait, perhaps I need to look at the output rows again.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,3,9,9,3,0]\n\nSo, the 9s are still there. The 3s are at positions 5 and 8. So these are adjacent to the 9s (positions 6 and 7). So those 3s are adjacent to the 9s. Then, in row 1, same pattern. Row 2: [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0]. Here, positions 5-8 are 3s, which are adjacent to the 3s in the rows above. So maybe once 3s are placed adjacent to 9s, they propagate in certain directions. Then, the 1s are placed adjacent to 3s.\n\nBut how does the propagation direction work? For example, in row 2 of Example 0's output, the 3s are in columns 5-8. This could be expanding downward from the 3s in row 0 and 1. Then, the 3s in row 2's columns 5-8 could be adjacent to the 3s in rows 0-1. Similarly, the vertical line of 3s in column 5 going down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are generated by moving in all directions except where blocked by 9s or other 3s. But the exact pattern isn't clear. Let's try to find a rule.\n\nLooking at another example: Example 3's input has 9s in the upper right (rows 0-1, columns 7-10) and lower middle (rows 9-14, columns 14-19). The output shows 3s surrounding these blocks and forming a path connecting them. The path goes left from the upper 9s, down, then right to the lower 9s. Then 1s are around the 3s.\n\nSo maybe the rule is:\n\n1. For each group of 9s, create a border of 3s around them.\n2. Then, connect all groups of 9s with a path of 3s, possibly the shortest path in some direction (like Manhattan or along grid lines).\n3. Then, create a border of 1s around all 3s (including the connected paths).\n\nBut how is the path determined? In Example 0, the two 9 groups are connected via a vertical line of 3s. In Example 3, the path goes left, down, then right. It looks like the path is the shortest possible that connects the groups, moving orthogonally.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s are added in all cells that are part of the minimal rectangle enclosing all 9 groups, but that's not exactly the case. For Example 0, the minimal rectangle would span from row 0-8 and columns 1-7, but the 3s in row 6 and columns 0-3 are outside that.\n\nWait, maybe it's a combination of expanding around the 9s and then connecting them with lines. For example, each 9 group is surrounded by 3s, then a line is drawn between the centers of the groups, filling those cells with 3s. Then, 1s are added around all 3s.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s are added in a way that they form a cross expanding from each 9 group, and then the cross paths connect. For example, each 9 group expands 3s in four directions (up, down, left, right) until they hit another 3 or the edge. Then, where these expansions intersect, they form a path. Then 1s are added around the 3s.\n\nThis might explain why in Example 0, the top 9s expand down and left, while the bottom 9s expand up and left, meeting in the middle. The 3s then form a vertical line between them.\n\nBut how to verify this. Let's take Example 3's input. The upper 9s are in rows 0-1, columns 7-10. Expanding 3s around them (adjacent cells) and then expanding left and down. The lower 9s are in rows 9-14, columns 14-19. Expanding 3s around them and then up and left. The path connecting them would require moving left from the upper group, down, then right to the lower group. The 3s in the output form this path.\n\nOnce the 3s are placed, the 1s are added in cells adjacent to the 3s. For example, in Example 0, the 1s are in rows 3-6, columns 6-7. These are adjacent to the 3s in rows 6, columns 0-3 and rows 0-2, columns 5-8.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Surround each 9 block with 3s in all adjacent cells.\n2. Expand 3s from each 9 block in all four directions (like a cross) until they meet other 3s or the grid edge.\n3. Connect all 9 blocks by the shortest path, filling with 3s.\n4. Add 1s in all cells adjacent to any 3.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact order. Another approach is to consider that each 9 block is first surrounded by a layer of 3s, then those 3s are expanded in certain directions (like left, right, up, down) to form connecting lines. Then, 1s are added around the entire 3 structure.\n\nIn the test input, there are two 9 blocks: one at rows 2-5, columns 16-19, and another at rows 16-21, columns 21-26. There's also a small 9 group at rows 22-23, column 4. The output should connect these with 3s and add 1s around.\n\nSo, applying the pattern:\n\n- Surround each 9 block with 3s.\n- Connect the 9 blocks with 3s, possibly expanding left and down from the first block and up and right from the others.\n- Then add 1s around all 3s.\n\nFor example, the block at (2-5, 16-19) would have 3s around them. The block at (16-21, 21-26) would also have 3s around them. The small 9 group at (22-23,4) would have 3s around. Then, 3s would connect these blocks. The path might go left from the first block to the edge, then down to the small block, then right to the lower right block, but I'm not sure. The exact path would depend on the transformation's rules.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s might form a horizontal line from the first 9 block to the small 9 group, then down to the lower right block. Then, 1s would surround all these 3s.\n\nBut to generate the actual output, I need to determine exactly how the 3s and 1s are placed. Since time is limited, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples and generate the test output accordingly.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a grid of numbers (mostly 0s and 9s) and the output seems to transform those numbers in some way. Let's start by examining the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has two rows with [9,9] near the middle and some at the bottom. The output adds numbers like 3 and 1 around those 9s. It looks like the 9s are surrounded by 3s, maybe forming a border. Also, there are 1s appearing further out. So perhaps there's a layering effect where each layer around the 9s is a different number. Like 9s are the core, then 3s around them, then 1s.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has blocks of 9s. The output shows 3s surrounding those blocks and 1s even further out. The pattern might involve expanding each 9 into layers of 3s and 1s. But how exactly? Maybe each original 9 stays, but adjacent cells (maybe diagonally too?) get 3s, and then cells adjacent to 3s get 1s. But wait, in the outputs, the 3s and 1s seem to form concentric layers. For example, in Example 0's output, the 9s are in the middle, surrounded by 3s, then 1s. So perhaps it's a matter of creating layers around the original 9s, where each layer is a different number. \n\nAnother angle: the transformation might involve multiple passes. First, the 9s are kept, then in the first pass, all cells adjacent to 9s (including diagonally?) become 3s. Then, in the next pass, cells adjacent to 3s become 1s. But looking at the outputs, sometimes there's a mix. Wait, in Example 0's output, the 9s are surrounded by 3s, and then there's a layer of 3s further out, and then 1s. Maybe it's two layers of 3s and then 1s? Or maybe it's based on the distance from the original 9s. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the original 9s are at positions (0,6-7) and (7-8,1-2). The output has 3s adjacent to those 9s, and then 3s a bit further. Wait, maybe each 9 creates a \"wave\" of 3s expanding outward, and then a wave of 1s beyond that. But how many layers? Maybe each expansion step adds a new number. For instance, 9 is the center. Then, cells at a distance 1 become 3, distance 2 become 3 again? Or perhaps the layers are 3, then 1. But in some examples, like Example 3's output, there are 3s surrounding the 9s, and then 1s further out. Then in other areas, like in Example 2, there's a 3 layer, then 1s. So perhaps the rule is that each 9 in the input is part of a structure that, in the output, is surrounded by 3s in a certain radius, and then 1s beyond that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a cellular automaton where each cell's value is determined by the presence of 9s in their vicinity. Let's think about how 3s and 1s are placed. For instance, in Example 0's output, the 3s are in positions adjacent to the original 9s. But wait, the original 9s are at rows 0 and 1, columns 6 and 7. The output in those rows has 3s in columns 5 and 8. So maybe the 3s are in cells that are one step away (including diagonally) from the 9s. Then, the 1s could be two steps away. But checking the output, in Example 0, the 1s are in rows 3,4,5,6, columns 6 and 7. Wait, maybe that's a different pattern. Let me look again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s form a diamond-shaped area around the 9s. For example, in Example 0, the 9s are in two horizontal lines. The 3s around them might be a diamond shape expanding out. But I'm not sure. Another approach: compare input and output cell by cell.\n\nTake the first example, input row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0]. The output row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,3,9,9,3,0]. So the 9s are preserved, and the cells immediately next to them (left and right) are 3s. Similarly, in row 7 of input, [0,9,9,0,...], output row 7 is [3,9,9,3,...]. So same pattern: 3s adjacent to the 9s. Then, in other parts of the output, there are 3s forming a sort of frame. Maybe the 3s are added in all cells adjacent to 9s (including diagonally?), and then 1s are added around the 3s. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 1s are in rows 3,4,5,6 columns 6 and 7. Wait, the original 9s are in rows 0-1 and 7-8. The 1s in row 3,4,5,6 would be several steps away. Maybe this is a two-step process. First, 3s are added around 9s. Then, 1s are added around 3s. But how many layers? Or perhaps the 3s are at a certain distance and the 1s at another. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input, there's a block of 9s in rows 2-5, columns 8-11. The output has 3s surrounding them, and then 1s further out. For example, in row 6 of the output, columns 2-3 are 9s, surrounded by 3s. Then, in rows below, there are 1s. So perhaps the 3s are the first layer around 9s, and 1s are the next layer around the 3s. So the process is:\n\n1. For each 9 in the input, set all adjacent cells (including diagonally) to 3, if they are 0.\n2. Then, for each 3, set all adjacent cells (again, including diagonally) that are 0 to 1.\n\nBut wait, in the output, some cells that are adjacent to 3s are turned into 3s again. Like in Example 0's output, the third row from the bottom (row 6) has [3,3,3,3,0,0,1,1,0,0]. Hmm, maybe it's not a simple two-step process. Alternatively, perhaps the layers are determined by the Manhattan distance from the original 9s. For example:\n\n- Cells at distance 1 from any 9 become 3.\n- Cells at distance 2 from any 9 become 1.\n\nBut let's check. In Example 0's input, the 9s are in positions (0,6), (0,7), (1,6), (1,7), (7,1), (7,2), (8,1), (8,2). Let's take the cell (0,5). Its distance to (0,6) is 1, so it becomes 3. That's correct. Then, cell (0,4) would be distance 2 from (0,6), so becomes 1? But in the output, row 0, column 4 is 0. So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the expansion is done in a way that creates layers of 3 and 1, but only in certain directions.\n\nWait, another observation: in the outputs, the 3s and 1s form rectangular borders around the original 9 blocks. For example, in Example 0, the 9s are in two horizontal pairs. The 3s form a border around them. Then, the 1s form another border around the 3s. So perhaps each 9 block is expanded by adding a layer of 3s around it (like a frame), then a layer of 1s around the 3s. But how is the frame determined? Like, for a block of 9s, the 3s would be the cells immediately adjacent (up, down, left, right, and diagonally) around the entire block. Then the 1s are another layer around that.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input: the input has a horizontal line of 9s in the first two rows (columns 7-10). The output has those 9s surrounded by 3s, then a layer of 3s around that, then 1s. For example, row 0 in the output is [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,9,9,9,9,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 9s are flanked by 3s on both ends. Then, in row 2, it's [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,...], which suggests that the 3s form a rectangle around the original 9s. Then, the 1s are in rows 4 and 5, columns 7-10. So maybe the 3s form a border around the 9s, and the 1s form another border around the 3s.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is:\n\nFor each contiguous block of 9s, add a layer of 3s around them (including diagonally adjacent cells), then a layer of 1s around the 3s. But how to handle overlapping areas where different blocks' layers meet?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire 9 structure (all connected 9s) is considered a single object, and layers are added around it. But in the examples, the 9s are sometimes separate. For example, in Example 0, there are two separate groups of 9s. Each group gets their own layers of 3s and 1s. But when their layers overlap, perhaps they combine.\n\nAlternatively, the layers are added regardless of the original grouping. Each 9 cell contributes to creating layers around itself. So cells adjacent to any 9 become 3, cells adjacent to any 3 (but not 9) become 1, and cells adjacent to any 1 (but not 3 or 9) become something else, but in the examples, the highest layer is 3 and 1.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's output, there's a block of 9s in rows 6-9, columns 15-18. The output has 3s around them, then 1s. For example, row 6 in the output is [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which suggests that 1s are further out. But how are they positioned?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a matter of expanding each 9 into a 3x3 square of 3s (with the original 9 in the center), but that doesn't seem to fit. For instance, in Example 0's input, the two 9s in the first row are adjacent. Expanding each into a 3x3 would overlap, but in the output, the 3s around them form a larger block.\n\nAlternatively, the process might be similar to a distance transform where each cell's value is based on its distance from the nearest 9. For example:\n\n- 9: original cells.\n- 3: cells at distance 1 (Manhattan or Euclidean) from any 9.\n- 1: cells at distance 2 from any 9.\n\nBut let's check. In Example 0's output, cell (0,5) is 3. Distance from (0,6) is 1, so that fits. Cell (0,4) is 0. Distance 2 from 9, so maybe it would be 1. But in the output, it's 0. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps Manhattan distance isn't the key.\n\nAnother approach: let's see if the layers are based on Moore neighborhoods (all eight surrounding cells). Maybe for each 9, all cells in its Moore neighborhood become 3. Then, for each 3, all cells in their Moore neighborhood (that aren't already 3 or 9) become 1. So this would be two passes. Let's test this with Example 0.\n\nOriginal 9s are in positions (0,6), (0,7), (1,6), (1,7), (7,1), (7,2), (8,1), (8,2).\n\nFirst pass: turn all cells adjacent to 9s (including diagonally) into 3. So for (0,6), the adjacent cells are (0,5), (0,7) (but already 9), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), etc. Wait, but (0,5) would become 3. Then, (0,4) would be adjacent to (0,5) (a 3), so in the second pass, it would become 1. But in the output, (0,4) is 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe the layers are applied only once.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s are the immediate neighbors (Moore neighborhood) of the 9s, and then the 1s are the neighbors of the 3s, but not overlapping with 9s or 3s. Let's check Example 0's output. The 3s are around the 9s, and then the 1s are in rows 3-6, columns 6-7. Those cells are two steps away from the original 9s. For example, the cells (3,6) and (3,7) are three rows below the top 9s. How would they be adjacent to 3s? Let's see: maybe the 3s are in rows 0,1,2,7,8,9. The 3s in rows 0 and 1 would be adjacent to the 9s. Then, the 3s in rows 7 and 8 would be adjacent to the lower 9s. The 3s in rows 2 and 9 might form a border. The 1s in rows 3-6 would be adjacent to the 3s in rows 2 and 7. For instance, row 3's 1s are at columns 6-7, which are directly below the 3s in row 2, columns 6-7. But in row 2 of the output, columns 5-8 are 3s. So maybe the 1s are adjacent to the 3s. \n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to outline possible steps:\n\n1. All original 9s remain 9.\n2. For each cell adjacent to a 9 (Moore neighborhood), if it's 0, turn it into 3.\n3. For each cell adjacent to a 3 (from step 2) and not a 9 or 3, turn it into 1.\n\nBut checking Example 0's output:\n\n- The original 9s are in rows 0,1 (columns 6,7) and 7,8 (columns 1,2).\n- Step 2: cells around those 9s become 3. For the top 9s, the cells to the left (columns 5,8) become 3. Also, the cells below (rows 2) become 3. For the bottom 9s, cells above (rows 6) become 3. So the 3s form a border around the 9s.\n- Step 3: cells adjacent to 3s become 1. For example, the cells below the top 3s (row 2, columns 5-8) would have their adjacent cells (row 3, columns 5-8) become 1. Similarly, cells above the bottom 3s (row 6, columns 1-2) would have adjacent cells (row 5, columns 1-2) become 1. But in the output, the 1s are in rows 3-6, columns 6-7. So perhaps this approach isn't matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different expansion. Looking at the outputs, the 3s seem to form a diamond or square around the 9 blocks. For instance, in Example 3's input, there are 9s in rows 0-1, columns 7-10. The output's 3s form a larger square around them. Similarly, the 1s are another layer outside. So perhaps for each block of 9s, the 3s are added in a way that extends the block by one cell in all directions, and then 1s extend another layer.\n\nFor example, a 2x4 block of 9s (like in Example 3's input) would be surrounded by a 3s layer making it 4x6, then 1s making it 6x8. But the exact pattern may vary based on the original 9s' positions.\n\nAnother angle: the output seems to have the 3s forming a sort of outline around the 9s, and the 1s forming a thicker outline. The layers are added in all directions, but perhaps with some priority. For instance, 9s are the highest priority, then 3s, then 1s. So overlapping layers from different 9 blocks merge.\n\nSo, putting this together, the transformation could be:\n\n- All 9s remain.\n- For each 9, expand outward in all directions (including diagonally) by one layer, replacing 0s with 3s.\n- Then, for each 3, expand outward again by one layer, replacing 0s with 1s.\n\nBut need to check if this fits the examples.\n\nTake Example 0's input. The top two rows have four 9s in the middle. Expanding each 9 to their Moore neighborhood (adjacent cells) would create a 3x3 area of 3s around each 9. But since the 9s are adjacent, their 3s would overlap. Then expanding the 3s into their Moore neighborhoods would create 1s further out.\n\nBut in the output, for the top 9s, the 3s are in columns 5 and 8 (rows 0 and 1), and in rows 2, columns 6-7. Then the 1s are in rows 3-6, columns 6-7. This could be explained by expanding the 3s downward. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each expansion step moves outward in a specific direction. For example, the 3s are added in a cross shape (up, down, left, right) around the 9s, and then 1s are added in a cross shape around the 3s. But this doesn't seem to fit the diamond-shaped patterns in some examples.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s are added in a diamond pattern expanding two steps from the 9s, and the 1s expanding further. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, there's a block of 9s in rows 2-5, columns 8-11. The output has 3s surrounding them, forming a larger block. Then, 1s are added around the 3s. For instance, row 6 has 3s and 9s. Then in rows 9-11, there are 1s and 3s. This could suggest that the 3s are added in all directions around the 9s, and then 1s are added around those 3s.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for the positions of 3s and 1s relative to the original 9s. For each 9 in the input, the output has 3s in positions that are one step away (including diagonally) and 1s two steps away. But this seems not to hold when multiple 9s are close, as their 3s and 1s would overlap.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each group of 9s is first expanded with a layer of 3s, and then any remaining 0s adjacent to the 3s become 1s. But perhaps in a way that the 3s form a border around the 9s, and the 1s form another border around the 3s.\n\nIn Example 3's output, the original 9s are surrounded by 3s, then another layer of 3s, then 1s. For example, the 9s in rows 0-1, columns 7-10 have 3s in rows 0-2, columns 5-12. Then, 1s are in rows 4-5, columns 7-10. So it's like two layers of 3s and then 1s.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is:\n\n1. For each 9 in the input, expand in all directions (left, right, up, down, diagonally) to create a layer of 3s.\n2. Expand again from the 3s to create a layer of 1s.\n3. However, if expanding from 3s would overlap with existing 3s or 9s, they remain as is.\n\nBut how many times do we expand each layer? It seems that 3s are one layer, and 1s are another. But in Example 3, the 3s seem to form two layers. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the expansion is done in a way that each original 9's 3s are added in a diamond shape. Let's take a single 9. The cells around it (distance 1 in all directions) are 3s. Then, cells at distance 2 are 1s. But when multiple 9s are close, their 3s and 1s overlap, creating larger regions.\n\nBut in Example 0, the two pairs of 9s are separated. Their 3s form separate borders, but the 1s in the middle rows (3-6, columns 6-7) are between the two 9 groups. How would those 1s form? They are two steps away from both groups. So perhaps each 9's 3s and 1s are generated, and then merged.\n\nAlternatively, the process is:\n\n- For each cell, if it is adjacent (Moore neighborhood) to any 9, it becomes 3.\n- For each cell that is adjacent (Moore neighborhood) to any 3 but not adjacent to any 9, it becomes 1.\n\nLet's test this on Example 0.\n\nOriginal 9s are in rows 0-1, 7-8. Cells adjacent to these 9s (Moore neighborhood) become 3. So, cells around the top 9s (0,6-7) would include (0,5), (0,8), (1,5-8), (2,5-8). Similarly, the bottom 9s (7-8,1-2) would have 3s in rows 6-9, columns 0-3. Then, for cells adjacent to these 3s but not adjacent to 9s, they become 1. So cells two steps away from the original 9s. For the top group, cells like (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,5-8), etc. But in the output, the 1s are in rows 3-6, columns 6-7, which are two steps below the top 9s. But according to this rule, those cells would be adjacent to the 3s in row 2, columns 6-7. Since those 3s are in row 2, adjacent cells would be row 3, columns 5-8. But in the output, row 3 has 1s in columns 6-7. Hmm, maybe the 3s are only in certain directions.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the transformation involves creating layers around each 9 in the following way:\n\n- For each 9, create a 3x3 square centered on the 9, where the 9 remains, and surrounding cells become 3 (if not already 9).\n- Then, create a 5x5 square around each original 9, where the outer layer (cells at distance 2) become 1 (if not already 3 or 9).\n\nBut this might not work when 9s are adjacent. For example, two adjacent 9s would form a larger block, and their 3x3 squares would overlap. However, looking at Example 0's output, the 3s around the top two 9s form a 3x4 area (rows 0-2, columns 5-8). Then the 1s are in rows 3-6, columns 6-7. That area is two rows below the 3s. This doesn't fit the 5x5 idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are added in all cells that are adjacent (Moore) to any 9, and the 1s are added in cells that are adjacent to any 3 but not to any 9. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\n- All cells adjacent to 9s become 3. This includes cells around the top and bottom 9s.\n- Then, cells adjacent to these 3s (but not adjacent to 9s) become 1.\n\nBut how to determine adjacency. Let's take a cell that is adjacent to a 3 but not to a 9. For instance, in the top group, the cell (2,6) is a 3 (adjacent to 9s in row 1). The cell (3,6) is adjacent to (2,6) (a 3). Since (3,6) is not adjacent to any 9 (the closest 9 is two rows above), it becomes 1. This matches the output where row 3, columns 6-7 are 1s. Similarly, cells (3,5) and (3,8) would be adjacent to 3s but not 9s, so become 1. But in the output, row 3 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0]. So columns 6-7 are 1s, but 5 and 8 are 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit. According to this rule, (3,5) should be 1 because it's adjacent to (2,5) which is a 3. But in the output, it's 0. So this approach may be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added only in cells that are adjacent to 3s and not adjacent to any other 3s or 9s. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let's look for another pattern. Notice that in the outputs, the numbers 3 and 1 form a cross or plus shape around the 9s. For instance, in Example 0, the 3s are in a vertical line extending down from the top 9s, and the 1s form a vertical line further down. Similarly, in Example 3, the 3s form a horizontal and vertical expansion around the 9s, and the 1s are further out.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation involves expanding each 9 into a vertical and horizontal line of 3s and 1s. For example, each 9 in the input generates a cross (vertical and horizontal) of 3s in the output. Then, a cross of 1s around the 3s. \n\nFor example, in Example 0, the top 9s are in row 0, columns 6-7. Their vertical cross would extend up and down, and left and right. But since the 9s are in the first row, the cross extends down. So for each 9, the cells in the same column and row are turned to 3s. Then, for each 3, the same applies to create 1s. \n\nBut this may not explain the diagonal 3s. For instance, in Example 0's output, row 0, column 5 is 3 (left of the 9s), which is part of the horizontal expansion. But in row 2, columns 6-7 are 3s, which is a vertical expansion down from the top 9s. Then, the 1s are in rows 3-6, columns 6-7, which is further vertical expansion of the 3s.\n\nThis suggests a vertical and horizontal expansion for each layer. So:\n\n1. For each 9, set all cells in the same row and column (excluding the 9 itself) to 3, up to a certain distance.\n2. Then, for each 3, set all cells in the same row and column to 1.\n\nBut how far? In Example 0, the top 9s in row 0, columns 6-7 have 3s in row 0, columns 5-8 (horizontal), and rows 0-2, columns 6-7 (vertical). Then, the 1s are in rows 3-6, columns 6-7 (vertical expansion from the 3s in row 2, columns 6-7).\n\nThis could fit. So for each 9, create a horizontal and vertical line of 3s extending left, right, up, and down until the grid's edge or another 9. Then, for each 3, create a horizontal and vertical line of 1s extending similarly. However, this doesn't account for diagonal cells in the examples. For example, in Example 3's output, the 3s form a square around the 9s, which includes diagonal directions. So this approach might not capture that.\n\nAnother observation: In the output, the 3s and 1s form concentric rectangles around the original 9 blocks. For example, in Example 3's input, the 9s form a horizontal block. The output has 3s forming a larger rectangle around them, and 1s forming another rectangle further out. This suggests that each contiguous block of 9s is surrounded by a layer of 3s, then 1s.\n\nThe algorithm could be:\n\n1. Identify all contiguous regions of 9s (connected via edges or corners).\n2. For each region, expand it by adding a layer of 3s around it (all cells adjacent to any cell in the region).\n3. Expand the 3s region by adding a layer of 1s around it (all cells adjacent to any 3 in the expanded region).\n\nThis would create two layers around each 9 block. But how to handle overlapping layers from different blocks?\n\nIn Example 0, there are two separate 9 blocks. Each gets their own 3 layers. Then, the 3 layers may merge. The 1 layers would be around the merged 3 layers.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the 3 layers around the top and bottom 9 blocks don't seem to merge. The top 9s have 3s below them (row 2), and the bottom 9s have 3s above them (row 6). But the 1s are in rows 3-6, columns 6-7. This could be the 1 layers from both 3 layers.\n\nAlternatively, the layers are added irrespective of other blocks. So each 9 block's 3 and 1 layers are independent, and where they overlap, the highest value (3) takes precedence.\n\nThis could explain the outputs. For example, in Example 0, each 9 block has their own 3 layer and 1 layer. The 1 layers from the top 9s are below their 3 layer, and the 1 layers from the bottom 9s are above their 3 layer, leading to the 1s in the middle.\n\nBut this is quite complex. How would I apply this to the test input?\n\nThe test input has several blocks of 9s:\n\n- In rows 2-5, columns 16-19 (four rows of four 9s).\n- In rows 7-10, columns 9-12 (four rows of four 9s).\n- In rows 16-21, columns 21-26 (six rows of six 9s).\n- In rows 22-23, columns 4-5 (two rows of two 9s).\n\nEach of these blocks would need to be expanded with 3s and 1s.\n\nFor example, the block in rows 2-5, columns 16-19 would have 3s surrounding them in all directions. Then 1s surrounding the 3s. Similarly for the other blocks.\n\nBut the challenge is to apply this to the test input and generate the output grid.\n\nAssuming the pattern is that each block of 9s is surrounded by a layer of 3s, then a layer of 1s, with 3s taking precedence over 1s, and 1s only appearing where there's no 3 or 9.\n\nThus, the steps would be:\n\n1. For each cell in the input, if it's a 9, keep it as 9.\n2. For all cells adjacent to any 9 (Moore neighborhood), set them to 3 if they are 0.\n3. For all cells adjacent to any 3 (from step 2) but not adjacent to any 9, set them to 1 if they are 0.\n\nThis approach would explain the layers. Let's test this with Example 0.\n\nStep 1: 9s remain.\n\nStep 2: Cells around 9s become 3. For the top 9s (rows 0-1, columns 6-7), their adjacent cells (including diagonally) would be rows 0-2, columns 5-8. Similarly, the bottom 9s (rows 7-8, columns 1-2) would have adjacent cells in rows 6-9, columns 0-3. So the 3s form a border around both groups.\n\nStep 3: Cells adjacent to the 3s but not adjacent to any 9. For example, the cells in row 2, columns 5-8 are 3s. Their adjacent cells include row 3, columns 5-8. But row 3, columns 6-7 are adjacent to 3s (row 2, columns 6-7) and not adjacent to any 9s (since the nearest 9s are in row 0-1). So these cells become 1. Similarly, the cells in row 6, columns 0-3 (3s) would have adjacent cells in row 5, columns 0-3, which become 1s.\n\nThis seems to match Example 0's output where the 1s are in rows 3-6, columns 6-7 and other areas. \n\nApplying this pattern to the test input:\n\nThe test input has multiple 9 blocks:\n\n1. A 4x4 block at rows 2-5, columns 16-19.\n2. A 4x4 block at rows 7-10, columns 9-12.\n3. A 6x6 block at rows 16-21, columns 21-26.\n4. A 2x2 block at rows 22-23, columns 4-5.\n\nFor each of these blocks:\n\n- Step 2: Surrounding cells become 3.\n- Step 3: Cells surrounding the 3s become 1.\n\nAdditionally, any overlapping areas where a cell is adjacent to both a 9 and a 3 would stay as 3.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nFor the first block (rows 2-5, columns 16-19):\n\n- The adjacent cells (Moore neighborhood) would be rows 1-6, columns 15-20. These cells become 3.\n- Then, cells adjacent to these 3s (rows 0-7, columns 14-21) become 1, but only if not adjacent to any 9.\n\nSimilarly for the other blocks. The output will have 3s around each 9 block and 1s around the 3s.\n\nNow, considering the test input's structure, the final output will have layers of 3s and 1s around each of the 9 blocks.\n\nFor example, the large 6x6 block at rows 16-21, columns 21-26 would have 3s in rows 15-22, columns 20-27 (assuming they don't go out of bounds).
