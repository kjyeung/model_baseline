        "cot_1": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists. Let's start by looking at the training examples to identify any commonalities or rules.\n\nFirst, I notice that in all the outputs, most elements are zero except for the fourth position (index 3?), which is always 5. Wait, looking at the inputs, the fourth element in each list is 5, and in the outputs, that position is also 5. So maybe the 5s are fixed and act as separators or markers. Also, in the outputs, the rows that are all 5s are kept the same, like in the input. So those rows are probably unchanged.\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output. For the first input row: [3, 0, 0, 5, 7, 0, 6, 5, 8, 0, 7]. The output is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,4]. Hmm, the 5s are at positions 3 and 7. In the output, those positions remain 5. The other elements are mostly zeros except the last two, which are 3 and 4. Wait, maybe the non-zero elements after the last 5 in the input are moved to the end of the output row. Let's check. The input row ends with 8,0,7. The output ends with 3,4. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the non-zero numbers in certain parts of the input are summed or concatenated into the end of the output.\n\nWait, in example 0's first input row: after the 5s (positions 3 and 7?), the numbers are 7,0,6,5,8,0,7. Wait, maybe the 5s are in positions 3 and 7. Let me check the indexes. The list starts at 0: positions 3 and 7 are both 5. So each input row has 5s at positions 3 and 7. In the output, the 5s are kept in those positions. All other positions in the output are zero except perhaps some elements at the end.\n\nWait, looking at example 0's output first row: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,4]. The 5s are at positions 3 and 7. The last two elements are 3 and 4. Where do those come from? Let's check the input row: the input has elements after the second 5 (position 7). The input row after position 7 is 8,0,7. The output has 0,3,4. Hmm, maybe not directly. Or perhaps the non-zero elements before the first 5 (positions 0-2) and between the two 5s (positions 4-6) and after the second 5 (positions 8-10) are being summed or rearranged.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row is created by taking all non-zero numbers from specific regions of the input row and appending them to the end of the output, replacing the original positions with zeros except for the 5s.\n\nFor example, in example 0's first input row:\n\nOriginal: [3,0,0,5,7,0,6,5,8,0,7]\n\nOutput: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,4]\n\nLooking at the non-zero numbers in the input before the first 5 (positions 0-2): 3. Between the 5s (positions 4-6):7,6. After the second 5 (positions 8-10):8,7. But in the output, the non-zeros at the end are 3 and 4. Wait, maybe those numbers are summed? 3+7+6+8+7=31, but that doesn't match 3 and 4. Alternatively, perhaps each section's non-zero numbers are concatenated in some way.\n\nWait, maybe each section (before first 5, between 5s, after second 5) is considered. For the first input row:\n\nBefore first 5 (positions 0-2): 3,0,0 \u2192 non-zero is 3.\n\nBetween first and second 5 (positions 4-6):7,0,6 \u2192 non-zeros 7,6.\n\nAfter second 5 (positions 8-10):8,0,7 \u2192 non-zeros 8,7.\n\nSo maybe the non-zeros from these sections are collected, summed, or concatenated. But the output ends with 3,4. How does 3 relate to the sections? 3 is from the first section. 4 could be 7+6+8+7? 7+6=13, 8+7=15. 13+15=28. Not 4. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output takes the non-zero elements from the input row, starting from the end, and appends them to the output after the second 5. Let's see.\n\nOriginal input row after second 5 (position 7) is 8,0,7. The non-zero elements here are 8 and 7. The output ends with 3,4. Hmm, not matching. Wait, maybe the output takes the non-zero elements from the entire input row (excluding the 5s) and appends them to the end of the output row, replacing their original positions with zeros.\n\nFor the first input row, the non-zero elements (excluding 5s) are 3,7,6,8,7. The output has 3 and 4. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the last two non-zero elements in the input row are moved to the end of the output. In the first input row, the last two non-zero are 8 and 7. But output has 3 and 4. Doesn't align.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers after the second 5 in the input are summed. For example, in the first input row, positions 8-10 are 8,0,7 \u2192 sum 15. But 15 is not in the output. The output has 3 and 4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output has all zeros except for the 5s and the sum of certain parts. Let's check other examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output. Take the sixth input row (0-based index 5):\n\nInput row: [1,0,9,5,0,0,6,5,0,7,3]\n\nOutput row: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,4]\n\nThe input's non-zero elements (excluding 5s) are 1,9,6,7,3. The output's non-zero after 5s is 4. Hmm, sum of all non-5 elements is 1+9+6+7+3=26, which is not 4. Alternatively, maybe count the non-zero elements? There are 5 non-zero elements, but output is 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output row is created by keeping the 5s and moving all non-zero elements from the input row to the end, filling from the right. For example, in the first example's input row:\n\nInput: [3,0,0,5,7,0,6,5,8,0,7]\n\nNon-5 elements: 3,7,6,8,7. Let's arrange them in the output after the 5s. The output is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,4]. Wait, the last two elements are 3 and 4, but the input's non-5 elements are 3,7,6,8,7. Maybe the sum of certain parts. 3 is from the first part, and 7+6+8+7=28, but 28 is not 4. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the 5s. Each input row has two 5s, except the row that's all 5s. The output rows (except the all-5s row) have two 5s in the same positions. So the 5s are fixed. The rest of the elements are zeros except for some numbers at the end.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, after the second 5 (position 7), there are sometimes non-zero numbers. For example, in example 0's first output row: the elements after position 7 are 0,3,4. So positions 8,9,10 are 0,3,4. Maybe the non-zero elements from the input are moved to the end of the output row, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input row, replacing all elements except the 5s with zeros, and then appending the non-zero elements (excluding 5s) from the input row to the end of the output row, but limited by the original row length. But how to fit them?\n\nWait, the input and output rows are of the same length (11 elements). So if we have two 5s in fixed positions (3 and 7), the rest of the elements (positions 0-2, 4-6, 8-10) are set to zero, except that some of the non-zero elements from the input are placed at the end of the output row.\n\nFor example, in example 0's first input row, the non-zero elements (excluding 5s) are 3,7,6,8,7. The output row has two 5s and the rest zeros except for the last two elements: 3 and 4. Wait, 3 is the first non-zero in the input. Where does 4 come from? 7+6+8+7=28, but 28 mod something? Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the sum of the non-zero elements after the first 5. Let's see: after the first 5 (position 3), the elements are 7,0,6,5,8,0,7. So non-zero elements here are 7,6,8,7. Sum is 28. But 28 isn't 4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count of non-zero elements in certain regions. For example, the number of non-zeros before the first 5, between the two 5s, and after the second 5. Then those counts are placed at the end. But in example 0's first input row, before first 5 (3 elements): 1 non-zero (3). Between the two 5s (positions 4-6): 7,0,6 \u2192 2 non-zeros. After second 5 (positions 8-10): 8,0,7 \u2192 2 non-zeros. So counts are 1,2,2. But the output has 3 and 4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero elements are summed in each of the three regions (before first 5, between, after) and then those sums are placed at the end. For example, before sum is 3, between sum is 7+6=13, after sum is 8+7=15. Then maybe concatenate these sums. But 3,13,15 would need more space. The output's last two elements are 3 and 4. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at example 0's first output row: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,4]. The last two elements are 3 and 4. Let's check the input row's non-zero elements. The input non-5 elements are 3,7,6,8,7. If we take the first non-zero (3) and the sum of the rest (7+6+8+7=28), but 28 is 2+8=10? No. Or maybe 28 mod 10 is 8, but not matching. Alternatively, the sum of all non-5 elements: 3+7+6+8+7=31. 3 and 1? No, but output has 3 and4. Not matching.\n\nHmm, this approach isn't working. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In the outputs, the rows that aren't all 5s have two 5s in positions 3 and 7. The other elements are zeros except for some trailing numbers. For example, in example 0's first output row, the last two elements are 3 and 4. The input row's non-5 elements are 3,7,6,8,7. How do 3 and 4 relate here? Maybe 3 is the first non-zero element in the input, and 4 is the number of non-zero elements after the first 5. Let's see: after the first 5 (position 3), the elements are 7,0,6,5,8,0,7. Non-zeros are 7,6,8,7. That's four elements. So 4. That would explain the 4. Then the first non-zero element is 3. So the output appends the first non-zero (3) and the count of non-zeros after the first 5 (4). So the last two elements are 3 and 4. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn example 1's output first row: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. The input first row is [3,0,0,5,0,2,0,5,0,6,0]. Non-5 elements:3,2,6. The first non-zero is 3. After the first 5, elements are 0,2,0,5,0,6,0. Non-zeros are 2 and6. Count is 2. So output should have 3 and 2, but the output ends with zeros. Wait, this doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, in example 1's output, the fifth row (index 4) is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,9,0]. The input fifth row is [0,3,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Non-5 elements:3. The first non-zero is 3. After first 5, elements are 0,0,0,5,... so non-zeros after first 5 are none. So count would be 0. But the output has 9 and 0. Hmm, doesn't match. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: look for the output rows and see where the non-zero elements come from. For example, in example 0's first output row, the non-zeros are 3 and 4. Let's look at the input's corresponding row. The input row's last three elements are 8,0,7. Output's last three are 0,3,4. How?\n\nWait, maybe the non-zero elements from the input row are moved to the end of the output, but in reverse order. So the input's non-zero elements (excluding 5s) are 3,7,6,8,7. Reversed, they are 7,8,6,7,3. The output's last two are 3,4. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of non-zero elements before the first 5, and sum of non-zero elements after the second 5. For example, in example 0's first input row: sum before first 5 (3), sum after second 5 (8+7=15). Then 3 and 15. But output has 3 and 4. 15 mod 11 (since the list has 11 elements) is 4, since 15-11=4. Oh! Maybe the sums are taken modulo 10 or something. 15 mod 10 is 5. But output has 4. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of digits. 15 \u2192 1+5=6. Not 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the non-zero elements after the second 5. In example 0's input row, after second 5 (position 7), elements are 8,0,7. Sum is 15. 15 divided by 3 (number of elements?) No. 15 in some way becomes 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of non-zero elements after the second 5. In example 0's input row, after second 5, there are 8 and 7 \u2192 2 non-zeros. But output has 4. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output row is created by moving all non-zero elements from the input row (excluding 5s) to the end, and padding with zeros. Let's see. For example 0's first input row:\n\nInput non-5 elements:3,7,6,8,7. Length 5. The output row has 11 elements, with two 5s. So positions 3 and 7 are 5s. The rest are zeros except the last few positions. The output row's non-5 elements after position 7 are positions 8-10: 0,3,4. But where do these numbers come from? Maybe the input non-5 elements are [3,7,6,8,7]. These are 5 elements. How to fit them into the output after position 7 (positions 8-10, three positions). So maybe only the last three non-zero elements are taken. 6,8,7 \u2192 sum to 21. Not helpful. Or they are placed as 6,8,7 \u2192 but output is 0,3,4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero elements are transformed into their positions. For example, the first non-zero element is at position 0 (3). Then the next non-zero after the first 5 is at position 4 (7). Then positions 6 (6), 8 (8), 10 (7). The output has 3 and 4. Not sure.\n\nHmm, maybe the pattern is that in each row, except the all-5s row, the elements are set to zero except for the 5s, and then the non-zero elements from the input are summed and placed in the last positions. But how?\n\nLooking at example 3's first output row:\n\nInput: [3,0,0,5,0,1,0,5,0,0,2]\n\nOutput: [0,0,0,5,0,4,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nThe non-zero elements after the 5s are 4. The input's non-5 elements are 3,1,2. How does 4 come from that? 3+1=4. Then maybe the sum of non-zero elements before the second 5. In the input row, after the first 5 (position 3), the elements are 0,1,0,5. So between the two 5s, the non-zero is 1. Then after the second 5 (position7), elements are 0,0,2. So sum of non-zero after second 5 is 2. But the output has a 4 in position5. Wait, maybe the sum of non-zero elements between the two 5s is 1, and after is 2. 1+2=3. Not 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's non-zero elements (other than 5s) are the sum of non-zero elements before the first 5, between the two 5s, and after the second 5. For example, in example3's first input row, before first 5:3, between:1, after:2. Sum is 3+1+2=6. But output has 4. Not matching.\n\nWait, example3's first output row has a 4 at position5. The input row's elements between the two 5s are 0,1,0. So sum is 1. But output has 4. How?\n\nAnother observation: the output's non-zero elements are in positions that might correspond to certain parts of the input. For instance, in example0's first output row, the 3 and 4 are in positions9 and10. Maybe these positions correspond to the sum of non-zero elements in certain regions modulo the length of the positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero elements in the input are moved to specific positions in the output. For example, all non-zero elements before the first 5 are moved to the end of the output, starting from position9, and similarly for other regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking the input row, replacing all elements except the 5s with zeros, and then appending the non-zero elements (in order) from the input, truncated to fit the row length. Let's see.\n\nExample0's first input row has non-5 elements:3,7,6,8,7. The output row has two 5s and the rest zeros except positions9 and10:3 and4. So maybe the first two non-zeros are 3 and7, but they are placed as 3 and7. But output has 3 and4. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs for rows that are not all 5s have two 5s, and the other elements are zeros except possibly some at the end. The non-zero elements in the output are placed in the last few positions. Let's check the positions of the non-zeros in the outputs.\n\nFor example, in example0's first output row, non-zeros are at positions9 and10 (3 and4). In example1's fifth output row (index5), the non-zero is at position10 (4). In example2's fifth row (index5), the non-zero is at position0 (4). This is inconsistent. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's related to the input's non-zero elements. For example, in example2's fifth input row: [0,0,0,5,8,0,0,5,0,8,6]. Output is [4,0,8,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. The non-zeros in the output are 4 and8. The input's non-5 elements are 8,8,6. How do 4 and8 come from that? Maybe the sum of the first and last elements:8+6=14 \u2192 14 mod 10=4. And 8 is the middle element. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's non-zero elements are the sum of certain parts of the input. For example, in example2's fifth input row, non-5 elements are 8 (position4),8 (position9),6 (position10). Sum of these is 22. But output has 4 and8. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output row is formed by taking the input row and, for each segment (before first 5, between 5s, after second 5), only the first non-zero in each segment is kept and moved to the end of the output. Let's test.\n\nExample0's first input row:\n\nSegments before first 5:3,0,0 \u2192 first non-zero is3.\n\nBetween 5s:7,0,6 \u2192 first non-zero is7.\n\nAfter second5:8,0,7 \u2192 first non-zero is8.\n\nSo the non-zero elements to move are3,7,8. But the output row has3 and4. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the first non-zero from each segment. 3+7+8=18 \u2192 18 mod something. Not 4.\n\nAlternatively, the count of non-zero segments. The input row has three segments (before, between, after) all with non-zero elements. So count 3. But output has 3 and4. No.\n\nAlternatively, the output row's non-zero elements are the sum of the non-zero elements in each segment, but only the first digit. For example, before sum is3, between is7+6=13 \u21921+3=4, after is8+7=15 \u21921+5=6. But output has3 and4. Maybe between sum is13, so 1+3=4. So the output appends3 and4. That could explain example0's first output row. Let's check another example.\n\nExample1's input row5: [1,0,9,5,0,0,6,5,0,7,3]. Output row5: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,4]. The input's segments:\n\nBefore first5:1,0,9 \u2192 non-zero sum is10 \u21921+0=1.\n\nBetween:0,0,6 \u2192 sum6.\n\nAfter:0,7,3 \u2192 sum10 \u21921+0=1.\n\nSo output should append1,6,1, but the output is4. Hmm, doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of each segment's non-zero elements is taken modulo 10. For example0's first input:\n\nBefore sum3 \u21923 mod10=3.\n\nBetween sum7+6=13 \u219213 mod10=3.\n\nAfter sum8+7=15 \u219215 mod10=5.\n\nSo output would append3,3,5. But output has3 and4. Not matching.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's think differently. Looking at the output rows, the non-5 elements are often placed in the last few positions. For example, in example0's first output row, the last two elements are3 and4. In example0's second output row, the last element is2. In example3's first output row, the fifth element is4. So perhaps the output is taking certain non-zero elements from the input and placing them in specific positions.\n\nWait, in example0's first output row, the non-5 elements are3 and4. Let's look at the input row's elements after the second5. The input after position7 is8,0,7. The sum of these is15. Maybe 15 is split into 1 and5, but output has4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of all non-5 elements in the input row is split into digits and placed at the end. For example0's first input row sum is3+7+6+8+7=31. Split into3 and1. But output has3 and4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the non-zero elements after the second5 in the input are summed, and that sum is placed in the output's last position. For example0's first input row:8+7=15. 15 mod 11 (length of the list) is4 (since 15-11=4). So 4 in the last position. Then the first non-zero before the first5 (3) is placed in the penultimate position. So output becomes ...3,4. That fits example0's first output row.\n\nCheck another example. Example1's input row5: [1,0,9,5,0,0,6,5,0,7,3]. After second5 (position7), the elements are0,7,3. Sum is10. 10 mod11=10. But output row5's last element is4. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of the elements after the second5 is taken, and then divided by the number of elements in that segment. The after segment has three elements:0,7,3. Sum is10. 10/3 is3.333, but output has4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the non-zero elements after the second5. In example0's first input row:8+7=15. 15 mod10=5, but output has4. Not.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is created by setting all elements except the 5s to zero, then appending the non-zero elements from the input (excluding 5s) in reverse order, truncated to fit the row length. Let's see.\n\nExample0's first input row non-5 elements:3,7,6,8,7. Reversed:7,8,6,7,3. The output row after the 5s has positions8-10:0,3,4. Doesn't fit. But maybe only the last two elements are kept:7,3. No. Output has3 and4.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the output rows, sometimes there are non-zero elements in the middle, like in example3's first output row, there's a4 at position5. How does that relate to the input?\n\nInput row for example3's first output: [3,0,0,5,0,1,0,5,0,0,2]. The output is [0,0,0,5,0,4,0,5,0,0,0]. The4 is at position5, which is between the two 5s (positions3 and7). The input has a1 at position5. So 4 is somehow related to the1. Maybe 1*4=4? Or 1+3 (the first non-zero) =4.\n\nBut example0's first input row has a7 at position4. Output has3 and4. 7-3=4. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output may be the result of a sliding window operation. For example, each element in the output is the sum of the next few elements in the input. But I don't see how that would apply here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived by taking the input row, replacing elements between the two 5s with their sum. For example, in example0's first input row between the 5s (positions4-6) sum7+0+6=13. Output has0 in those positions. So that's not it.\n\nWait, example3's first output has a4 at position5. The input between the 5s (positions4-6) is0,1,0. Sum is1. 4 is not 1. So no.\n\nHmm, maybe the output's non-zero elements are the sum of the non-zero elements in each segment, but written in a specific way. For example, example0's first output row has3 and4. The input's before segment has sum3, between has sum13 (7+6=13), after has sum15 (8+7=15). 3,13,15. Maybe concatenate the first digits: 3,1 (from13),1 (from15) \u2192 but output has3 and4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, sum all non-zero elements and split into digits. 3+7+6+8+7=31 \u21923 and1. Output has3 and4. Not.\n\nAnother angle: the output rows have two 5s, and the rest of the elements are zero except for some that are moved to the end. The number of non-zero elements in the output varies. For example, in example0's output, some rows have two non-zeros (like the first row:3,4), others have one (like the third row:2). So the rule must determine how many and which non-zeros to keep.\n\nWait, let's compare input and output rows in example0:\n\nInput row 0: [3,0,0,5,7,0,6,5,8,0,7]\n\nOutput row0: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,4]\n\nThe non-5 elements in input are3,7,6,8,7. The output has3 and4. Maybe3 is the first non-zero in the input, and4 is the sum of the last two non-zeros (8 and7) \u21928+7=15 \u21921+5=6. No. Or 8*7=56 \u21925+6=11 \u21921+1=2. No. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of all non-zero elements after the first 5:7+6+8+7=28 \u21922+8=10 \u21921+0=1. Not 4.\n\nAlternatively, the number of non-zero elements after the first 5:7,6,8,7 \u21924 elements. So output has4. And the first non-zero is3. So output ends with3 and4. This would fit example0's first output row.\n\nCheck example3's first input row:\n\nInput row0: [3,0,0,5,0,1,0,5,0,0,2]\n\nNon-zeros after first5:1,2. So two non-zeros. But output has4 in position5. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Unless it's counting non-zeros between the two 5s. In this case, between the 5s, the input has0,1,0. One non-zero. So output would have1. But the output has4. So that's not it.\n\nWait, in example0's first output, the4 corresponds to the count of non-zeros after the first5. Which is4. So output appends the first non-zero and the count of non-zeros after the first5. For example0's first input row, first non-zero is3, count after first5 is4 \u21923,4. That fits.\n\nCheck example3's first output row. Input non-zeros after first5:0,1,0 (between the two 5s). Non-zeros:1. Count is1. So output would append3 and1. But the output has4 in position5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother example: example1's output row5: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,4]. The input row5 is [1,0,9,5,0,0,6,5,0,7,3]. Non-zeros after first5:6,7,3. Count is3. So output would append1 (first non-zero) and3. But output's last element is4. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Another approach: look for all the output rows and see if there's a common pattern in how non-zeros are placed.\n\nIn example0's outputs:\n\nRow0: last two elements 3 and4.\n\nRow1: last two elements7 and0,0. Wait, no. Row1's output is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,7,0,0]. So the last three elements are7,0,0. So non-zeros are7 at position8.\n\nRow2: last element2.\n\nSo perhaps the non-zeros are being placed in varying positions. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output rows are transformed by moving all non-zero elements (excluding 5s) to the right, but maintaining the 5s in their original positions. For example, in the input row, the non-5 non-zero elements are shifted to the end, passing through the 5s. Let's see.\n\nExample0's first input row: [3,0,0,5,7,0,6,5,8,0,7]. The non-5 non-zero elements are3,7,6,8,7. To shift them to the end while keeping 5s in place, the output would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,7,6,8,7]. But since the row length is fixed at11, we can't add elements. So perhaps the non-zero elements are moved to the end, but the 5s are anchors, and the zeros fill the remaining spaces. So the output would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,3,7,6,8,7], but again, this exceeds the length. So perhaps only the last few non-zero elements are kept.\n\nAlternatively, the non-zero elements are shifted to the right, but after the 5s. So for example, in the first input row, after moving, the elements would be:\n\nBefore first5:0,0,0.\n\nBetween 5s:0,0,0.\n\nAfter second5:0,3,7,6,8,7. But the row must have 11 elements, so after second5 (position7), there are positions8,9,10. So we can only have three elements. The non-zero elements are8,0,7 in the input. So after shifting, they become0,8,7. But output has0,3,4. Not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at all training examples, the output rows that aren't all 5s have two 5s in positions3 and7. The other elements are zeros except for some at the end. For example, in example0's output, the first row ends with3,4. The second row ends with7,0,0. Third with2. So the pattern seems to be that the non-zero elements from the input row are somehow condensed into the end of the output row, but the exact method isn't clear.\n\nWait, perhaps each output row is derived by taking the input row and, for each of the three segments (before first5, between5s, after second5), taking the sum of the non-zero elements and placing those sums in specific positions. For example, the sum of the before segment is placed in position9, the between sum in position10, and the after sum in position8. Let's test.\n\nExample0's first input row:\n\nBefore sum3, between sum7+6=13, after sum8+7=15.\n\nIf sums are placed in positions9,10,8:\n\nOutput would have [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,15,3,13]. But the output is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,4]. No match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of each segment is converted to a single digit. For example, between sum13 \u21921+3=4. After sum15 \u21921+5=6. Before sum3. So output would have3,4,6. But the output has3 and4. Maybe only the first two sums. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the sums are taken modulo 10. Before sum3 \u21923, between13 mod10=3, after15 mod10=5. Output has3 and4. No.\n\nWait, example0's output first row has3 and4. The between sum13 and after sum15. 13+15=28. 28 mod something. 28 divided by 7 (number of non-5 elements?) 28/7=4. So 4. Maybe that's where the4 comes from. But then why the3? It doesn't explain the3.\n\nAlternatively, the count of non-zero elements in the between and after segments. Between has2 non-zeros (7,6), after has2 (8,7). Sum 2+2=4. So output has4. The first non-zero is3. So output ends with3 and4. This fits example0's first output row.\n\nLet's test another example. Example3's first input row: [3,0,0,5,0,1,0,5,0,0,2]. Between segments (between5s) has1 non-zero (1), after has1 non-zero (2). Sum1+1=2. Output has4 in position5. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output's non-zero elements are the sum of all non-zero elements before the first5, and the sum of all non-zero elements after the second5. For example0's first input row: before sum3, after sum15. So output appends3 and15. But 15 can't fit, so perhaps modulo 10. 15 mod10=5. So output would have3 and5. But output has3 and4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of non-zero elements between the two 5s and after the second5. In example0's first input: between sum13, after sum15. 13+15=28. 28 mod10=8. Output has4. Not matching.\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the answer is that all elements except the 5s are set to zero, and any non-zero elements in the input are moved to the end of the output, but only keeping the last two or three non-zero elements, and the rest are zeros. For example, in example0's first input row, the non-zero elements are3,7,6,8,7. The last two are8 and7. But output has3 and4. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by keeping the 5s and moving all non-zero elements from the input (excluding5s) to the end of the output row, filling from the right, and padding with zeros. For example, input non-zeros:3,7,6,8,7. The output would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] and then append the non-zeros \u2192 but the row length is fixed. So the non-zeros would be placed in the available positions after the 5s. In example0's first output, the available positions after the second5 are positions8,9,10. So the non-zero elements are moved there. However, there are 5 non-zero elements in the input, but only3 positions available. So perhaps only the last three non-zeros are taken:6,8,7. But the output has3 and4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero elements are sorted in descending order, and the highest two are placed at the end. For example0's input non-zeros:3,7,6,8,7. Sorted:8,7,7,6,3. Highest two are8 and7. Output has3 and4. No.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let's try to look for a different pattern. \n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\n[2,0,3,5,2,0,0,5,0,3,0]\n\n[7,6,0,5,0,7,0,5,6,7,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,6,0,3,5,0,0,2]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[7,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,6,0,4]\n\n[0,6,0,5,0,2,7,5,0,2,0]\n\n[6,0,2,5,0,3,0,5,0,7,0]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[7,0,0,5,0,6,0,5,2,3,0]\n\n[0,0,6,5,0,2,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0,5,0,7,0,5,0,6,7]\n\nThe expected output for the test input needs to be determined. Let's assume that the pattern is that in each row (except the all-5s), the elements are set to zero except the two 5s, and the non-zero elements from the input are summed in a certain way and placed at the end. For example, the sum of non-zero elements before the first5 is placed in position9, the sum of non-zero between in position10, and after in position8. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input row and replacing all elements except the 5s with zeros, then appending the count of non-zero elements in each segment (before, between, after) to the end. For example, in example0's first input row, counts are1,2,2. The output has3 and4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of non-zero elements in each segment is taken modulo 10. For example0's first input row: before sum3, between sum13 mod10=3, after sum15 mod10=5. Output has3 and4. No.\n\nAnother possibility: the output row is created by keeping the 5s and moving the non-zero elements from the input (excluding 5s) to the end of the row, starting from the position after the second5, but in reverse order. For example, in example0's first input row, non-zeros are3,7,6,8,7. Reversed:7,8,6,7,3. The output row after the second5 has positions8,9,10. So the first three non-zeros in reversed order are7,8,6. But output has0,3,4. Not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I'm missing something obvious. Let's look for another approach.\n\nIn all training examples, the output rows that are not all 5s have two 5s and the rest are zeros except for some elements at the end. The number of non-zero elements at the end varies. For example, in example0's first output row, there are two non-zeros, in example1's fifth row, one non-zero. \n\nPerhaps the non-zero elements in the output are the non-zero elements from the input row, but only those that appear after the second5. For example, in example0's first input row, after the second5 (position7), the elements are8,0,7. Non-zeros are8 and7. So in the output, those would be placed after the second5. But the output has0,3,4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the non-zero elements after the second5 are summed. For example0's input row:8+7=15 \u219215 mod10=5. Output has4. Not.\n\nAnother observation: In the output rows, the non-zero elements are sometimes located in the same positions as in the input. For example, in example2's sixth input row: [0,0,6,5,0,0,0,5,3,0,0]. Output row6 is [0,6,7,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. The non-zero elements6 and7 are in positions2 and3 of the output. But position3 is5. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, the output's non-zero elements are the first and last non-zero elements from the input. For example0's first input row's first non-zero is3, last is7. Output has3 and4. Not matching.\n\nAfter spending a lot of time and not finding a clear pattern, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the examples. The key observations are:\n\n- All rows with two 5s in the input have output rows with the same two 5s and zeros elsewhere except for some trailing numbers.\n- The trailing numbers in the output seem to relate to the non-zero elements in the input, possibly their counts or sums.\n- The all-5s rows are unchanged.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll assume that the transformation involves moving all non-zero elements (except 5s) to the end of the row, ordered in a specific way (like reverse order) and truncating to fit the row length. For example, take the non-zero elements, reverse them, and place them at the end of the output row, replacing the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nTesting this hypothesis with example0's first input row:\n\nNon-zero elements (excluding 5s):3,7,6,8,7. Reversed:7,8,6,7,3. The output row has positions8-10:0,3,4. Doesn't fit. So this is incorrect.\n\nAlternative hypothesis: The output is created by taking the input row, replacing all elements except the two 5s with zeros, and then appending the sum of the non-zero elements (excluding 5s) as the last element. For example0's first input sum is3+7+6+8+7=31. Last element is31 mod10=1. Output's last element is4. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: The output's non-zero elements are the counts of non-zero elements in each segment (before, between, after). For example0's first input row: before count1, between count2, after count2. So output would have1,2,2. But output has3 and4.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and the competition context, I'll proceed to make a guess based on the examples. Perhaps the output is created by setting all elements to zero except the two 5s, and then placing the sum of the non-zero elements (excluding 5s) in the first available position after the second5. If the sum exceeds a certain value, it's split into digits. For example, in example0's first input sum31, which is3 and1. The output's last two elements are3 and4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sum is split into digits and placed in the available positions. For example31 \u21923 and1. But output has3 and4. Not matching.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer for the test input is that all elements except the two 5s are zeros, and the non-zero elements from the input are moved to the end. For example, the test input's first row:\n\nInput: [2,0,3,5,2,0,0,5,0,3,0]\n\nNon-zero elements (excluding5s):2,3,2,3. Reversed:3,2,3,2. The output row has positions8,9,10 available. So placing3,2,3. But row length is11. The output would have [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,3,2,3]. But in example0's outputs, they have trailing numbers like3 and4. Not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to generate the output by setting all elements except the two 5s to zero and appending the non-zero elements from the input after the second5. For the test input's first row, after the second5 (position7), elements are0,3,0. Non-zero is3. So output row would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,3]. But in the training examples, sometimes multiple numbers are added. \n\nAlternatively, considering the training examples, the output rows often have trailing non-zeros that seem to be related to the non-zero elements after the second5 in the input. For example, in example0's first input row, after the second5, elements are8,0,7 \u2192 non-zeros are8 and7. The output's last two elements are3 and4. Maybe the sum of these is15 \u21921+5=6, but output has4. Not sure.\n\nGiven the confusion and time constraints, I'll proceed to generate the output by setting all elements except the two 5s to zero. For the test input rows:\n\nFor example, the first test input row:\n\n[2,0,3,5,2,0,0,5,0,3,0] \u2192 output would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,0], but considering the training examples where sometimes numbers are moved to the end. But I'm not sure. Based on the training examples, the output for the test input would likely be all zeros except the two 5s and possibly some non-zeros at the end based on certain rules, but without a clear pattern, this is a guess.\n\nGiven the examples, the safest guess is to set all elements except the two 5s to zero, and if there are any non-zero elements after the second5 in the input, they are placed at the end of the output. So for the test input's first row, after the second5 (position7), the elements are0,3,0 \u2192 non-zero is3. So output would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,0]. But looking at the training examples, sometimes the non-zeros are placed in the last positions. For example, in example0's first output row, the non-zeros are in positions9 and10. So perhaps in the test input, the non-zero elements after the second5 are placed at the end.\n\nAnother observation: in the training examples, the non-zero elements in the output are often the non-zero elements from the input's after the second5, but sometimes others. For example, example0's first output row's 3 and4 don't directly correspond to the input's after elements. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to assume that the output is generated by keeping the two 5s and setting all other elements to zero. For the test input, this would mean all rows except the all-5s row would have zeros except the two 5s. However, some of the training examples have non-zeros at the end. For example, example0's first output row has [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,4], which has non-zeros. So there's more to it.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output's non-zero elements are the non-zero elements from the input row's before the first5, between the two 5s, and after the second5, but concatenated and moved to the end. For example, in example0's first input row, the non-zero elements are3 (before),7,6 (between),8,7 (after). Concatenated:3,7,6,8,7. Since the output has two positions after the second5 (positions9 and10), perhaps only the last two non-zeros are kept:8,7. But output has3 and4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the non-zero elements before the first5 and the count of non-zeros between the two 5s. For example0's first input:3 +2=5. Output has3 and4. Not.\n\nAt this point, given the time and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed to generate the test output by setting all elements except the two 5s to zero. However, this doesn't explain the trailing non-zeros in the training examples. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input row with all elements except the two 5s set to zero, and then the non-zero elements from the input (excluding5s) are appended to the end, filling from the right. For example, in example0's first input row, the non-zero elements are3,7,6,8,7. Appended to the end, the output would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,3,7,6,8,7], but since the row is length11, it's truncated to [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,3,7,6]. But the example output has [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,4]. Doesn't match.\n\nGiven that all my attempts to find the pattern have failed, I'll proceed to guess that the output is generated by setting all elements except the two 5s to zero, and appending the sum of all non-5 elements as the last element. For the test input's first row, sum is2+3+2+3=10. 10 mod10=0. But the example0's sum is31, and output's last element is4. 31 mod10=1, but output has4. So this is incorrect.\n\nFinal guess: The output is generated by keeping the two 5s, setting all other elements to zero, and moving the non-zero elements from the input (excluding5s) to the end, but only the last two. For example, in example0's first input row, the non-zero elements are3,7,6,8,7. Last two are8,7. So output would have those in the last two positions:0,0,0,5,...,8,7. But example0's output has3 and4. Doesn't fit. \n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll have to make a best guess. The test input's output would likely have all elements except the two 5s set to zero, except for the all-5s row. So the output for each non-all-5s row would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0], except where the training examples show otherwise. But some training examples have non-zeros, so this isn't accurate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for each row is the input row where all elements except the two 5s are zero, and any non-zero elements from the input's after the second5 are placed in the end. For example, in the test input's first row, after the second5 is0,3,0. So output's last three elements are0,3,0. But the row needs to have two 5s. So the output would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,0]. \n\nBut in example0's first output row, after the second5 are0,3,4. The input's after elements are8,0,7. So how did3 and4 get there? This suggests that my guess is incorrect.\n\nGiven that I can't determine the exact pattern, I'll proceed to output the following based on the training examples' structure, replacing all elements except the two 5s and appending certain non-zeros. For the test input, perhaps the output is:\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] for all rows except the all-5s row, and the all-5s row remains. However, looking at the training examples, some rows have non-zeros, so I'm not confident. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is:\n\nFor each row:\n\n- Keep the two 5s in positions3 and7.\n- Replace all other elements with0.\n- If there are non-zero elements in the input after the second5, sum them and place the sum in the last position.\n\nFor example, test input's first row: after second5 elements are0,3,0. Sum is3. So output last element is3. The row becomes [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,3].\n\nBut example0's first row's sum after second5 is8+7=15. Sum is15, which would be placed as15, but the output has4. Not matching. \n\nPerhaps the sum is modulo 10. 15 mod10=5. Output has4. No.\n\nThis is really not working. Given the time, I'll proceed to generate the output by setting all elements except the two 5s to zero, and for any row that isn't all 5s, append the sum of the non-5 elements at the end. For example, test input's first row sum is2+3+2+3=10 \u219210. Output would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,10]. But the output examples don't have two-digit numbers. So this is incorrect.\n\nFinal answer: Given the time constraints and lack of a clear pattern, I'll generate the output by setting all elements except the two 5s to zero, as in the training examples. For rows that are not all 5s, the output will be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. The all-5s row remains the same. However, this doesn't account for the non-zero elements in some training examples. But perhaps the correct answer is this, and the non-zero elements in the training examples are exceptions for certain rows. So for the test input:\n\nThe output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nBut in some training examples, like example0's first row, there are non-zeros. So this answer may be incorrect. However, without understanding the pattern, this is the best I can do.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of lists (rows), and the output is another list of lists. The first thing I notice is that in the output, most of the elements are zeros except for the fifth element (index 3, since it's 0-based) in each row, which is 5. Wait, no, looking closer, in the outputs, all the rows except the fourth one (index 3) are filled with zeros except for the 5s. Wait, wait. Let me check the first example.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the fourth row is all 5s. And in the output, that row remains all 5s. So maybe the fourth row is a separator and remains unchanged. Let's check other examples. Example 1's input also has the fourth row as all 5s, and in the output, it's the same. So that's consistent. So the fourth row is a divider and stays as 5s.\n\nNow, looking at the other rows. Let's see the transformation from input to output. Let's take Example 0's first input row: [3, 0, 0, 5, 7, 0, 6, 5, 8, 0, 7]. The output is [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 3, 4]. Hmm. So in the input, the 5s are at positions 3 and 7 (indices 3 and 7). In the output, those positions are still 5s. All other positions are zeros except the last two elements in this row, which are 3 and 4. Wait, where did those numbers come from?\n\nLooking at the input row, maybe the numbers after the second 5 (index 7) are being shifted or moved. Let's see. The original row after index 7 is 8, 0, 7. The output has 0,3,4. That doesn't immediately make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the non-zero numbers in the input rows are being collected and placed at the end of the output row, but only in certain positions.\n\nWait, let's take another example. Example 0's second input row: [0, 0, 9, 5, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 6, 0]. The output is [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 0, 0]. The output here ends with 7 and 0, but the input had 9,5,0,3,0,5,0,6,0. Hmm. The 7 in the output's 8th position (index 8) is maybe from the input's 9 and 3? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows have their non-zero elements (other than the 5s) taken from some other part of the input. Let's look at the output rows. In Example 0's first output row, the last two elements are 3 and 4. Where could those come from? The input's first row ends with 0,7. Maybe those numbers are added? Wait 3+4=7, but that's not exactly matching. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers after the last 5 in the input row are being summed or concatenated. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row, the 5s are at index 3 and 7. The elements after index 7 are 8,0,7. The output's last two elements are 3 and 4. Not sure. Let's look at another example. Example 1's input first row is [3,0,0,5,0,2,0,5,0,6,0]. The output is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Wait, but in Example 1's output, some rows do have non-zero elements. Like in the fifth input row (index 5) of Example 1: input is [1,0,9,5,0,0,6,5,0,7,3], output is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,4]. The last element here is 4, but the input's last elements after 5 (index 7) are 0,7,3. So 4 is not directly from there. Maybe it's the sum of some numbers. 7+3=10, which is not 4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero elements in the input row are being shifted to the right in the output. Let's check. For Example 0's first input row: the non-zero elements (excluding 5s) are 3,7,6,8,7. The output's non-zero elements are 3,4. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe the numbers after the second 5 (index 7) are being moved to the end. In the first input row of Example 0, after index 7: 8,0,7. The output's last two are 3,4. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking the non-zero numbers from the input row, excluding the 5s, and placing them in the last positions, but only as many as there are non-zero elements. Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's first input row: [3,0,0,5,7,0,6,5,8,0,7]. The non-zero elements (excluding 5s) are 3,7,6,8,7. That's five numbers. The output row is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,4]. So the last two elements are 3 and 4. Hmm, but 3 and 4 are not in the input. Wait, maybe it's summing the numbers. For example, 3+7=10, but 10 isn't 3 and 4. Alternatively, maybe it's the count of non-zero elements. But that's five, which would be 5, but in output, it's two numbers. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output rows have all zeros except for the 5s, and some numbers moved from the input. Let's look at Example 3's input and output. In Example 3, the input's first row is [3,0,0,5,0,1,0,5,0,0,2]. The output is [0,0,0,5,0,4,0,5,0,0,0]. The output has 4 in the fifth position (index 5). Where does that 4 come from? The input's fifth element is 1, but here it's 4. Maybe the 1 is transformed to 4. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions in the input are summed or processed in some way.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the first non-zero element after each 5 in the input and placing them in specific positions. For example, in Example 0's first input row, after the first 5 (index 3), the next elements are 7,0,6. The first non-zero here is 7. Then after the next 5 (index 7), elements are 8,0,7. The first non-zero is 8. But in the output, the last two elements are 3 and 4. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe adding 7 and 6 (which would be 13, but again not matching 3 and 4).\n\nAlternatively, looking at the positions of the 5s. Each input row has two 5s, except the fourth row which is all 5s. Maybe in the output, the two 5s remain, and the rest of the elements are zero except for some numbers that are derived from the non-zero elements between the two 5s in the input.\n\nWait, let's check. Take Example 0's first input row: the first 5 is at index 3, then the next 5 is at index 7. The elements between them (indices 4-6) are 7,0,6. Summing those gives 13. But the output's non-zero elements after the second 5 (index 7) are 0,3,4. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, the numbers after the second 5 in the input (indices 8-10) are 8,0,7. The sum is 15, which doesn't match the output's 3 and 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers after the second 5 are being moved to the end of the output row. In Example 0's first input, after the second 5 (index 7) are 8,0,7. The output has 0,3,4. Not matching. Wait, maybe the output is taking the numbers from the end of the input row. Like the last two numbers in the input row are 0,7. The output's last two are 3 and 4. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the sum of the non-zero elements between the two 5s and appending that to the end. For example, in Example 0's first row between 5s (indices 4-6): 7,0,6 \u2192 sum 13. But the output has 3 and 4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is taking the non-zero elements from the entire input row (excluding 5s) and placing them starting from the end of the output row, but reversed. For example, in Example 0's first input row, non-zero elements are 3,7,6,8,7. Reversed: 7,8,6,7,3. Then, in the output, after the two 5s, the last two elements are 3 and 4. Wait, that doesn't add up. Unless 7+8=15, 6+7=13, 3 remains. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output first row: the input row is [3,0,0,5,0,1,0,5,0,0,2]. The output is [0,0,0,5,0,4,0,5,0,0,0]. The output has a 4 at index 5. Where does that come from? The input's elements between the two 5s are 0,1,0. Summing gives 1, but output is 4. Alternatively, maybe it's the count of non-zero elements. There's 1 non-zero (the 1), but 4 is different. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the sum of the non-zero elements before the first 5 and after the second 5. For Example 0's first input row, before first 5: 3,0,0 \u2192 sum 3. After second 5: 8,0,7 \u2192 sum 15. Maybe 3 and 15 are split into digits. 15 \u2192 1 and 5. But the output's last two are 3 and 4. Not matching.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output first row: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,4]. The 3 and 4 are at positions 9 and 10. Maybe these are the sums of the non-zero elements before the first 5 and between the two 5s. For Example 0's first input row: before first 5: sum 3. Between 5s: sum 7+6=13. 3 and 13 \u2192 3 and 1+3=4. Oh! That might be it. So sum before first 5, then sum between the two 5s, then sum after second 5. But how are they arranged?\n\nWait, in Example 0's first output row, the last two elements are 3 and 4. The sum before the first 5 is 3. The sum between the two 5s is 7+0+6 =13. Then, sum after the second 5 is 8+0+7=15. But 3, 13, 15. How do we get 3 and 4? Maybe 13 is split into 1 and 3, but that doesn't explain 4. Alternatively, maybe the sum between the two 5s is 7+6=13, which modulo 10 is 3, and then the sum after is 8+7=15 \u2192 5, but 15 mod 10 is 5. But output has 3 and 4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of the digits between the two 5s. Let's see. Between the two 5s in the first input row (indices 4-6): 7,0,6 \u2192 digits sum 7+0+6=13. The output's last two numbers are 3 and 4. 1+3=4? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output's non-zero elements are the count of non-zeros before the first 5 and after the second 5. For Example 0's first input row: before first 5, non-zeros: 1 (the 3). After second 5: 8,0,7 \u2192 two non-zeros (8 and7). So 1 and 2. But output has 3 and4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the output are the sum of all non-zero elements in the input row, split into digits. For Example 0's first row: 3+7+6+8+7=31. Split into 3 and 1. But output has 3 and4. No.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's try another approach. Let's compare the input and output rows for each example and see if there's a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output rows:\n\nInput row 0: [3,0,0,5,7,0,6,5,8,0,7]\nOutput row 0: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,4]\nThe 5s are at the same positions. The non-zeros in the output are 3 and4 at the end. How do these relate to the input?\n\nThe input's non-zero elements (excluding 5s) are 3,7,6,8,7. Maybe 3 and 4 are derived from 7+6=13 (1+3=4?) and 8+7=15 (1+5=6?), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's last two numbers are the count of non-zero elements before the first 5 and between the two 5s. For example:\n\nIn input row 0, before first 5: 3 \u2192 count 1.\nBetween 5s:7,0,6 \u2192 count 2 (7 and6).\nSo 1 and2 \u2192 but output has3 and4. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: the output's non-zero elements (other than 5s) are in the same positions as the input's non-zero elements after the second 5. Let's check.\n\nIn input row 0, after the second 5 (index7) are 8,0,7. So non-zero positions 8 and10. Output row 0 has non-zeros at 9 and10 (indices9 and10). So shifted one position to the right? But 8 becomes 0 in the output, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the output's non-zero elements are at indices9 and10 with values3 and4. Input's after second5 has 8,0,7. How does that turn into3 and4? Maybe 8-5=3 and7-3=4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers after the second5 in the input are summed and then split into digits. 8+7=15 \u2192 1 and5. But output has3 and4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the non-zero elements from the input, but shifted to the right by some amount, and then summed where overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are generated by keeping the 5s in place and moving all other non-zero elements to the end of the row, maintaining their order but shifting to the right.\n\nFor example, input row0: [3,0,0,5,7,0,6,5,8,0,7]. The non-5 elements are3,7,6,8,7. Moving them to the end after the second5 (positions after index7). So the output would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,3,7,6,8,7], but the row has length 11, so maybe truncating. But the actual output is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,4]. Which is shorter. So perhaps only two numbers are kept, maybe the first two non-zero elements after the second5. But in the input row0, after the second5, the non-zeros are8 and7. So those would be 8 and7. But the output has3 and4. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look for another pattern. Notice that in the output, except for the fourth row, all rows have two 5s at positions3 and7. So the output rows are structured as follows: zeros up to the first5, then zeros until the second5, then zeros except possibly some numbers at the end.\n\nWait, in Example0's output row0, after the second5 (index7) there are zeros except for positions9 and10 (values3 and4). So maybe the non-zero elements in the output are the sum of certain parts of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by combining non-zero elements from different parts of the input. For example, the sum of non-zero elements before the first5 and after the second5.\n\nFor input row0: before first5 sum is3, after second5 sum is8+7=15. Then combining 3 and15 as 3 and15. But the output is3 and4. Not matching.\n\nWait, 15's digits sum to1+5=6. 3 and6 would be 3 and6, but output is3 and4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count of non-zero elements before and after. For input row0, before:1, after:2. But output is3 and4.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nLet's look at another example. Example1's input row5: [1,0,9,5,0,0,6,5,0,7,3]. Output is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,4]. The output's last element is4. The input's non-zero elements after the second5 are0,7,3 \u2192 sum is10. 1+0=1, but output is4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are the sum of the non-zero elements between the two5s and after the second5. For example, input row0: between5s sum7+0+6=13, after sum8+0+7=15. 13+15=28. 2+8=10. Output has3 and4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the digits of the sum of all non-zero elements in the input row (excluding5s). For input row0, sum3+7+6+8+7=31. Digits3 and1. Output has3 and4. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Another approach: look for the positions where the output has non-zero elements. For example, in Example0's output row0, the non-zero elements are at positions3,7,9,10. But wait, the 5s are at3 and7. So the other non-zeros are at9 and10. Let's check if other output rows have similar positions. In Example0's output row1, the non-zeros are at positions8 and9 (7 and0), but wait, the output row1 is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,7,0,0]. So 7 is at index8. How does that relate to the input row1?\n\nInput row1 is [0,0,9,5,0,3,0,5,0,6,0]. The non-zero elements are9,3,6. The output has7 at index8. Where does7 come from? Maybe 9+3+6=18, which is 1+8=9, but output is7. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's non-zero numbers are taken from specific positions in the input. For example, in Example0's output row0: 3 and4 could be from the input's first element (3) and some other element. The input's first element is3, and the last element is7. 3 and7 sum to10, but output is3 and4.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's consider that the output rows are formed by moving all non-zero elements (other than the5s) to the end of the row, but ordered in some way.\n\nFor example, input row0: [3,0,0,5,7,0,6,5,8,0,7]. The non-5 non-zeros are3,7,6,8,7. Moving them to the end would give [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,3,7,6,8,7], but since the row is length11, it's truncated. But the output's last three elements are0,3,4. Which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero elements are summed and placed at the end. 3+7+6+8+7=31. 31 as 3 and1. Output has3 and4. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe it's the product. 3*7*6*8*7=7056. Digits are7,0,5,6. Output has3 and4. No.\n\nAnother angle: the output rows seem to have two 5s, and then possibly some numbers at the end. The number of non-zero elements after the second5 varies. For example, in Example0's output row0, there are two non-zero elements (3,4). In row1, one (7). In row2, two (0,2). Wait, example0's output row2: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,2]. So the last element is2. The input row2 is [7,2,0,5,0,0,2,5,0,3,0]. Non-5 non-zeros:7,2,2,3. Sum is14. 1+4=5. But output is2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the maximum value of the non-5 elements. For input row2, max is7. Output last element is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the problem differently. The input rows have two 5s (except the fourth row), and the output rows also have two 5s. So the 5s are fixed. The other elements in the output are mostly zeros except for some numbers. Maybe those numbers are derived from the non-5 elements in the input row, but how?\n\nLooking at the output rows in Example0:\n\nRow0: ends with 3 and4.\nRow1: ends with7 and0.\nRow2: ends with2.\nRow5: ends with0,0,7.\nWait, maybe it's the non-zero elements from the input row, but shifted to the end. For example, in Example0's row0 input: non-zeros are3,7,6,8,7. The output row0 ends with3 and4. How?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of each segment divided by the number of elements in that segment. Like, before first5, between5s, after second5. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the output are the sum of the digits in each segment. For example, before first5:3 \u2192 sum3. Between5s:7+0+6=13 \u2192 1+3=4. After5s:8+0+7=15 \u21921+5=6. But output has3 and4. So maybe the first sum is3 and the second sum is4. Then where are they placed? In the output row0, after the second5, the next positions are filled with3 and4. So that could fit. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's input row0:\n\nBefore first5: sum3 \u2192 digits sum3.\nBetween5s:7+0+6=13 \u2192 digits sum1+3=4.\nAfter5s:8+0+7=15 \u2192 digits sum1+5=6.\nSo the output row0 has3,4 in the last two positions. But why not 6? Maybe only the first two sums are used. So 3 and4 are placed at the end.\n\nIn Example0's output row0: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,4]. The 3 and4 are at positions9 and10. So maybe the sums of before and between are placed there.\n\nLet's check another example. Example0's input row1: [0,0,9,5,0,3,0,5,0,6,0]. Sum before first5:9 (sum is9 \u2192 digits sum9). Between5s:0+3+0=3 \u2192 sum3. After5s:0+6+0=6 \u2192 sum6. So output should have9 and3. But the output row1 is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,7,0,0]. The 7 is at position8. Hmm, doesn't fit. So this idea might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the numbers after the second5. For Example0's row0, after second5:8+0+7=15 \u2192 digits sum1+5=6. But output has3 and4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, another approach: the output rows have their non-zero elements (other than5s) in the same positions as the input rows' non-zero elements, but moved to the end. For example, in Example0's row0 input, non-5 elements are at positions0,4,6,8,10. The output row0 has non-zeros at9,10. Maybe the non-zero elements are shifted to the end, maintaining order. But in the input, the last three elements are8,0,7. In output, it's0,3,4. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the non-zero elements are moved to the end, but wrapped around. For example, the input row0's non-zeros are3,7,6,8,7. If we move them to the end, but there's only three positions after the second5. So maybe they are summed or concatenated. But again, not sure.\n\nMaybe I need to find a pattern where the non-zero elements in the output are the sum of certain parts of the input, split into digits. For example, sum of all non-5 elements in the input row, split into digits and placed at the end. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's row0 input: sum is3+7+6+8+7=31. Digits3 and1. Output has3 and4. No.\n\nExample0's row1 input sum:9+3+6=18. Digits1 and8. Output has7 and0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output's non-zero elements are the sum of the numbers before the first5 and the sum of numbers between the two5s. For Example0 row0:3 and7+6=13. So 3 and13. Maybe 3 and1+3=4. Hence,3 and4. That fits the output row0's last two elements. Let's check this.\n\nExample0 row0 input:\n\nBefore first5: sum3.\nBetween5s:7+0+6=13 \u2192 sum13. Digits1+3=4.\nSo output is3 and4. Yes! That matches the output row0's [0,3,4] at the end.\n\nNow check Example0 row1 input:\n\nBefore first5:9 (sum9).\nBetween5s:0+3+0=3 \u2192 sum3. Digits sum3.\nSo output should have9 and3. But the output row1 is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,7,0,0]. The non-zero elements are7 and0. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, input row1 of Example0 is [0,0,9,5,0,3,0,5,0,6,0]. So before first5:0,0,9 \u2192 sum9. Between5s:0,3,0 \u2192 sum3. Then the sum of after second5:0,6,0 \u2192 sum6. Maybe the output is sum before, sum between, sum after, but how?\n\nOutput row1's last elements are7 and0. How does 9 and3 become7 and0? That doesn't fit. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of before and between. 9 +3=12 \u2192 1 and2. But output row1 has7. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's check another example. Example3's input row0 is [3,0,0,5,0,1,0,5,0,0,2]. Output row0 is [0,0,0,5,0,4,0,5,0,0,0]. The output has4 at index5. Let's see: sum before first5 is3. Sum between5s is0+1+0=1. Sum after second5 is0+0+2=2. So 3,1,2. How does that result in4 at index5?\n\nAlternatively, the output's index5 is4. Maybe the sum between the two5s (1) plus something. Not sure. Alternatively, the sum between the two5s plus the sum after. 1+2=3. Not 4.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of all non-5 elements:3+1+2=6. But output has4. Not matching.\n\nAnother Idea: The output's non-zero elements are the sum of the digits in the input row (excluding5s). For Example0's row0:3+7+6+8+7=31 \u21923+1=4. Output has3 and4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the digits between the two5s. For Example3's row0 input: between5s is0,1,0 \u2192 sum1. The output has4 at index5. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look at another example. Example1's input row5: [1,0,9,5,0,0,6,5,0,7,3]. Output row5 is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,4]. The non-zero element is4 at the end. What's the sum between the two5s:0+0+6=6. Sum after:0+7+3=10. Maybe 6+10=16 \u21921+6=7. Not4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the digits of the sum between the two5s. For this row, between5s sum6 \u2192 digit6. Output is4. No.\n\nAnother Idea: The output's non-zero elements are the count of non-zero elements in each segment. For example, in Example0 row0 input:\n\nBefore first5:1 non-zero.\nBetween5s:2 non-zeros (7 and6).\nAfter second5:2 non-zeros (8 and7).\nTotal counts:1,2,2. How does that become3 and4?\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is taking the sum of the non-zero elements before the first5 and between the two5s, then appending those sums as digits. For Example0 row0:3 (sum before) and13 (sum between). So 3 and13 \u2192 3,1,3. But output has3 and4. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum between the two5s is taken modulo 10. For Example0 row0: sum between is13 \u21923. Then 3 (before) and3 (mod10 between). But output has3 and4.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's try to find another pattern. Looking at the output rows, the non-zero elements after the second5 are sometimes present. For example, in Example0's output row0, they are 3 and4. In row1,7. In row2,2. In Example1's output row5,4. In Example3's output row0,4. Maybe these numbers are derived from the sum of the input's non-zero elements in certain positions.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output row0: the last two elements are3 and4. Input row0's non-5 elements are3,7,6,8,7. Maybe the sum of all these is31. 3+1=4. But the output has3 and4. 3 and4 sum to7, which is the last element of the input row (7). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output's non-zero elements are the first and last non-zero elements of the input row (excluding5s). For Example0 row0, first non-5 is3, last is7. So output would have3 and7, but the output has3 and4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output rows and see if they have any relation to other rows in the input. For example, maybe the output row is formed by taking elements from the input rows below or above. But given that each row is processed independently in the examples, this seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the output row is generated by setting all elements to zero except for the two 5s and moving the non-zero elements from the input row's end to the output's end, but with some transformation. For example, in Example0's row0 input: non-zeros at the end are8,0,7. Output has3,4. Maybe 8-5=3 and7-3=4. But why subtract 5 and 3? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, it's the difference between consecutive elements. 8-0=8, 0-7=-7. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the product of the first and last non-5 elements:3*7=21 \u21922 and1. Not matching3 and4.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's consider that the output's non-zero elements are the sum of the non-zero elements in the input row before the first5 and after the second5. For Example0 row0: before sum3, after sum8+7=15 \u21923+15=18 \u21921 and8. Output has3 and4. No. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the non-zero elements between the two5s. For Example0 row0:7+6=13 \u21921+3=4. Output's last element is4. But the output has3 and4. Where does the3 come from? Maybe the sum before first5 is3. So 3 and4. That fits. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0 row1 input: [0,0,9,5,0,3,0,5,0,6,0]. Sum before first5:9. Sum between5s:0+3+0=3. Sum between is3. So output should have9 and3. But the output row1 is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,7,0,0]. The7 here. Hmm, doesn't fit. But maybe it's sum after second5:0+6+0=6. 3+6=9. 9 mod 10 is9. But output has7. Not sure.\n\nExample3's input row0: [3,0,0,5,0,1,0,5,0,0,2]. Sum between5s:0+1+0=1. Sum before3. So output should have3 and1. But output has4. Not matching.\n\nWait, but in Example3's output row0, the non-zero element is4 at index5. Maybe that's the sum between the two5s:1, but why 4? Not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The output's non-zero elements are the sum of the non-zero elements after the second5. For Example0 row0:8+7=15 \u21921+5=6. But output has3 and4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the non-zero elements after the second5, modulo 10. 15 mod10=5. But output has4.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe the pattern is that the output rows have all elements zero except for the two5s and the last few elements, which are the non-zero elements from the input row but shifted to the right and summed where they overlap. For example, if the input has non-zero elements at positions a, b, c, then the output has them at positions a+1, b+1, c+1. But in Example0's row0, the input non-zeros are at0,4,6,8,10. Shifting right would be1,5,7,9,11. But the output row has11 elements, so index11 is out of bounds. So maybe they wrap around. But Example0's output row0 has non-zeros at9 and10. So maybe the non-zeros are shifted to the end. For example, the input's non-zeros are3,7,6,8,7. Shifting them to the end would give [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,3,7,6]. But output is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,3,4]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the non-zero elements are reversed and placed at the end. Reversed:7,8,6,7,3. Placed at the end, but the output has3 and4. So maybe only the first two elements of the reversed list are taken:7 and8. But output has3 and4. Doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let's try to look for another pattern. The output rows in the examples have a certain number of non-zero elements. For example, Example0's output has row0:2 non-zeros, row1:1, row2:1, etc. Maybe the number of non-zero elements in the output row corresponds to the number of non-zero elements in the input row's certain segments.\n\nAlternatively, the output's non-zero elements are the sum of the even-positioned non-zeros and the sum of the odd-positioned non-zeros in the input row. Not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's look at the output for the test input. The test input is:\n\n[2,0,3,5,2,0,0,5,0,3,0]\n[7,6,0,5,0,7,0,5,6,7,0]\n[0,0,0,5,6,0,3,5,0,0,2]\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n[7,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,6,0,4]\n[0,6,0,5,0,2,7,5,0,2,0]\n[6,0,2,5,0,3,0,5,0,7,0]\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n[7,0,0,5,0,6,0,5,2,3,0]\n[0,0,6,5,0,2,0,5,0,0,0]\n[2,0,0,5,0,7,0,5,0,6,7]\n\nThe fourth row (index3) is all5s, so output should keep that row as is. For other rows, we need to apply the pattern.\n\nAssuming that the output rows have two5s in positions3 and7, and the rest zeros except possibly some numbers at the end. Let's take the first test input row: [2,0,3,5,2,0,0,5,0,3,0]. The two5s are at positions3 and7. The non-5 non-zeros are2,3,2,3. Sum before first5 (2,0,3) is2+3=5. Sum between5s (2,0,0) is2. Sum after5s (0,3,0) is3. According to previous incorrect hypothesis, maybe the output has the sum before and between, but 5 and2. But output needs to be zeros except for two5s and possibly numbers at the end. For example, if the sum of before and between is5 and2, but how to place them? Or maybe the digits of the sum between. 2 is 2, but output might have digits5 and2. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row's non-zero elements are the sum of the non-zero elements before the first5 and between the two5s, split into digits. For the first test input row: before sum2+3=5. Between sum2. So digits5 and2. So output row would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,5,2]. But looking at the training examples, sometimes the output's non-zero elements are at the end. For example, in Example0's row0, the last two elements are3 and4. So for this test row, maybe the last two elements are5 and2. But let's see.\n\nAnother test input row: [7,6,0,5,0,7,0,5,6,7,0]. Non-5 elements:7,6,0,7,0,6,7. Before first5:7+6=13. Between5s:0+7+0=7. So sum13 and7 \u2192 digits1+3=4 and7. Output might have4 and7 at the end. So output row would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,4,7].\n\nBut in the training examples, sometimes there's only one non-zero at the end. Like in Example0's row1, output ends with7. So perhaps if the sum between is a single digit, it's placed there. But I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, the output may take the sum of the non-zero elements before the first5 and between the two5s, then concatenate those sums as digits. For example, if before sum is5 and between sum is2, the output would have5 and2 at the end.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll make an educated guess based on Example0's pattern where the last two elements are the sum before and between the two5s. For the first test input row:\n\nBefore first5: elements are2,0,3 \u2192 sum2+3=5.\nBetween5s:2,0,0 \u2192 sum2.\nSo output row ends with5 and2 \u2192 [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,5,2].\n\nBut looking at Example0's row0, the sum between was13 (7+6), which was split into digits1 and3. But output had4. Maybe the sum between is converted to a single digit by adding digits. 7+6=13 \u21921+3=4. So for the first test row, between sum is2 \u2192 single digit2. Before sum is5. So output ends with5 and2.\n\nBut in Example0's row0, before sum was3 (single digit), between sum13 \u21921+3=4. So output was3 and4. That fits. So perhaps the rule is: sum of non-zero elements before first5 is kept as is (if single digit) or split into digits (if multiple digits), and sum of non-zero elements between5s is summed and split into digits, then these are placed at the end of the output row.\n\nLet's apply this to the first test input row:\n\nBefore sum:2+3=5 \u2192 single digit5.\nBetween sum:2 \u2192 single digit2.\nSo output row would end with5 and2 \u2192 [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,5,2].\n\nBut looking at Example3's output row0, the between sum was1, which became4 in the output. That doesn't fit this pattern. So maybe there's another layer.\n\nWait, in Example3's input row0: between sum is0+1+0=1. But the output row has4 at index5. So this theory doesn't hold. So perhaps another step is involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's non-zero elements are the sum of the digits of the sum of non-zero elements before the first5 and between the two5s. For Example0 row0: before sum3 (3), between sum13 (1+3=4). So 3 and4. For Example3's row0: before sum3, between sum1. So 3+1=4. Output has4. Ah! Maybe the output's non-zero elements are the sum of the before and between sums, split into digits.\n\nFor Example0 row0:3+13=16 \u21921+6=7. But output has3 and4. Doesn't fit. No.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the before and between sums. For Example0 row0:3+13=16. Output has3 and4. 1+6=7. No.\n\nAlternatively, the product. 3*13=39 \u21923+9=12 \u21921+2=3. No.\n\nThis is not working. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that the output's non-zero elements after the two5s are the sum of the non-zero elements before the first5 and the sum of the non-zero elements between the two5s, each summed to a single digit if necessary. For example, sum before is3, sum between is13 (1+3=4), so output is3 and4.\n\nApplying this to the first test input row:\n\nSum before:2+3=5 (5 remains).\nSum between:2 (2 remains).\nSo output ends with5 and2 \u2192 [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,5,2].\n\nFor the second test input row: [7,6,0,5,0,7,0,5,6,7,0].\nSum before:7+6=13 \u21921+3=4.\nSum between:0+7+0=7 \u21927.\nSo output ends with4 and7 \u2192 [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,4,7].\n\nThird test input row: [0,0,0,5,6,0,3,5,0,0,2].\nSum before:0+0+0=0.\nSum between:6+0+3=9.\nSo output ends with0 and9 \u2192 [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,9].\n\nFourth test input row: [7,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,6,0,4].\nSum before:7.\nSum between:0+0+0=0.\nSo output ends with7 and0 \u2192 [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,7,0,0].\n\nFifth test input row: [0,6,0,5,0,2,7,5,0,2,0].\nSum before:6.\nSum between:0+2+7=9.\nSo output ends with6 and9 \u2192 [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,6,9].\n\nSixth test input row: [6,0,2,5,0,3,0,5,0,7,0].\nSum before:6+2=8.\nSum between:0+3+0=3.\nSo output ends with8 and3 \u2192 [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,8,3].\n\nEighth test input row: [7,0,0,5,0,6,0,5,2,3,0].\nSum before:7.\nSum between:0+6+0=6.\nSo output ends with7 and6 \u2192 [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,7,6].\n\nNinth test input row: [0,0,6,5,0,2,0,5,0,0,0].\nSum before:6.\nSum between:0+2+0=2.\nSo output ends with6 and2 \u2192 [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,6,2].\n\nTenth test input row: [2,0,0,5,0,7,0,5,0,6,7].\nSum before:2.\nSum between:0+7+0=7.\nSo output ends with2 and7 \u2192 [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,2,7].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, sometimes the output has non-zero elements not just at the end. For example, Example0's output row0 has3 and4 at positions9 and10, which are the last two elements. So applying this pattern, the test output would have the sums placed at the end.\n\nHowever, in Example3's output row0, the non-zero element is4 at position5, which is between the two5s. This contradicts the pattern I hypothesized. So this might not be correct, but given the time, I'll proceed with this approach for the test input.\n\nPutting it all together, the test output would have:\n\nEach row (except the fourth) has two5s at positions3 and7. The remaining elements are zeros except for the last few positions, which are the sum of non-zero elements before first5 and between the two5s, possibly summed to a single digit.\n\nBut looking back at Example3's output row0: input sum between was1, but output is4. So my pattern doesn't fit. Therefore, my answer might be incorrect, but I'll proceed.",
