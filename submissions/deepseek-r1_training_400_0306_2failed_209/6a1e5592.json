        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The goal is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the training examples to see what's changing. Let's start with Example 0. The input has multiple rows of numbers, mostly 0s, 2s, and 5s. The output seems to replace some 0s with 1s. Let's compare the input and output row by row.\n\nLooking at the first input row in Example 0: all 2s. The output is the same. So 2s stay as 2s unless something else happens. \n\nSecond input row: [2, 0, 2, 2, ..., 0]. The output replaces the 0s with 1s. So the 0s in the second row become 1s. But wait, there are other 0s in lower rows that might not change. Let me check the third row. Input is [2,0,0,2,...0], output has 1s in those positions. Then in the fourth input row, which is all 0s, the output has some 1s. Like the first element is 0 in input, output is 0. But the next ones are 1s. Wait, the output for the fourth row in Example 0 is [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1]. Hmm, so the 0s in certain positions turn to 1s. \n\nWait, maybe it's about layers. The input seems to have different layers. The top rows are 2s, then some 0s and 5s. The output replaces 0s with 1s in certain areas. Maybe it's related to proximity to 2s or 5s? Or maybe the 1s are forming a sort of outline around the 2s and 5s? Let's think.\n\nAnother approach: look at the positions where 0s are turned into 1s. For example, in Example 0, the second row of input has 0 at position 1 and 14 (assuming 0-based or 1-based indexing? Let's check. The second input row is [2,0,2,2,...2,0]. So the first element is 2, then 0, then 2s until the end which is 0. The output is [2,1,2,...2,1]. So those 0s become 1s. Similarly, the third row in input has several 0s that become 1s. But in the fourth row, which is all 0s, some become 1s. So maybe the rule is that a 0 becomes 1 if it's adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a 2 or 5 in the input? Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's fourth row input: all 0s. Output is [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1]. Let's see what's above and below. The third input row is [2,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0]. So the fourth row is directly below that. The positions where 0s become 1s in the fourth row might be under the 2s or 0s from the third row. Wait, the third row's first element is 2, then 0,0,2... Maybe if a 0 in a row is adjacent (above, below, left, right) to a 2 or 5, it becomes 1. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's second row, the 0s are at positions 1 and 14. The elements above (first row) are 2s, so the 0s are adjacent (below) to 2s. So they become 1s. The third row's 0s: positions 1,2,5,6,7,8,14. The elements above (second row) are 2s in some positions. For example, position 1 in the third row is 0. The position above (second row's position 1) is 0. Wait, but maybe it's adjacent horizontally. Hmm, this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are in positions where the original 0 is adjacent to a 2 in any direction (including diagonally). Let's check. For Example 0's fourth row. The first element is 0. The element above (third row's first element) is 2. So that 0 in fourth row's first position would be adjacent (above) to a 2. But in the output, it's 0. Wait, that contradicts. So maybe not.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the 1s are created in a \"wave\" that propagates downward from the 2s. Like, each row below the 2s gets 1s where there are 0s, but only up to a certain distance. Let's look at the rows in Example 0. The first three input rows have 2s, and their outputs have 2s and 1s. Then the fourth row (all 0s) has 1s in certain positions. Maybe each 0 in a row is turned into 1 if there's a 2 in the same column above it, but only up to a certain number of rows down. For example, in the fourth row of Example 0's input, the 0s that are directly under 2s in the third row (which is the row above) become 1s. Let's see:\n\nThird row input (Example 0) is [2,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0]. So columns with 2s are 0,3,4,5,9,10,11,12,13. In the fourth row (all 0s in input), the output's first element is 0. But columns 0 in third row has 2, so why isn't the fourth row's column 0 a 1? Hmm, that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the 1s are generated in a way that they spread downward but only for a certain number of layers.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output: the fourth row has [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1]. Let's see the columns where 1s are. For example, column 1: third row has 0, fourth row input is 0 but output is 1. Maybe the 1s are created based on neighboring 1s in the rows above. Wait, but the third row's output has 1s in positions 1 and 2 (and others). Maybe it's a cellular automaton where 0s become 1s if there's a 1 or 2 in the cell above. Let me check.\n\nThird row output in Example 0 is [2,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. So in column 1, there's a 1. The fourth row's column 1 in input is 0. The output for fourth row column 1 is 1. So if the cell above is 1 (from the third row output), then the current cell becomes 1. But wait, the fourth row's first element is 0 in input and output. The third row's first element is 2, so maybe 0s under 2s don't change. But how about 0s under 1s?\n\nWait, maybe the 1s are propagating downward. Each 1 in a row will cause the cell below it (if it's 0) to become 1. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's third row output, positions 1 and 2 are 1. The fourth row input is 0s. The fourth row output has 1s in positions 1,2,3,6,7,8,14. So the 1s in the third row's positions 1 and 2 would cause the cells below (fourth row positions 1,2) to become 1, which they do. Similarly, the third row's positions 6,7,8 are 1s, so the cells below (positions 6,7,8 in fourth row) become 1s. But then what about position 14 in the third row's output, which is 1. The cell below in fourth row's position 14 is 0 in input and becomes 1 in output. That fits. So maybe the rule is: for each 0 in a row, if the cell directly above it in the previous row (post-transformation) is a 1 or 2, then it becomes 1. But wait, in the fourth row's first column, the third row's first column is 2 (output). But the fourth row's first column is 0 in input and remains 0 in output. So that contradicts. So maybe 2s don't propagate downward, but 1s do.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation works in two steps:\n\n1. Replace certain 0s with 1s based on some condition related to adjacent 2s or 5s in the input.\n\nBut maybe not. Let's think again. Another angle: in the output, the 1s form a kind of outline around the 2 regions. For example, in the first training example, the 2s are in the top rows, and the 1s are surrounding them. Similarly, in Example 0's output, the 1s are forming a border around the 2s. Similarly, the 5s in the lower rows are perhaps being replaced with 0s, and their outline is 1s? But in the outputs, the 5s are replaced with 0s. Wait, looking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nIn the input's last few rows, there are 5s. The output replaces them with 0s. So the 5s in the input become 0s in the output. And perhaps the 0s adjacent to 5s become 1s? Let's check. For example, in Example 0's input row 6 (the seventh row), there's a 5 at position 13. The output row 6 has 0s except for position 13 being 0. Wait, no: input row 6 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0], output is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 5 is replaced with 0, but adjacent 0s are not turned into 1s. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe the 5s are being removed (turned to 0) but their adjacent cells are not part of the 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are created based on proximity to 2s, and 5s are irrelevant except that they turn into 0s. Let's check. In Example 0, the 5s in input are replaced with 0s in output, but the 1s are in the upper rows. So perhaps the 1s are generated based on the 2s, and the 5s are just turned to 0.\n\nLooking at the first three rows of Example 0's input and output:\n\nOriginal input has 2s in the top rows. The output replaces some 0s with 1s. For example, in the second row, the 0s are adjacent to 2s (left and right). But in the third row, the 0s are adjacent to 2s as well. But the output's 1s are in those positions. Maybe any 0 that is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a 2 becomes 1, and this propagates down. But then why in the fourth row there are 1s? Let's see the fourth row's input is all 0s. The output has 1s in positions where there are 2s in higher rows, perhaps. Like, columns where there's a 2 above. For example, in the fourth row, position 1 in the output is 1. Let's look up the column. In the third input row, column 1 is 0. Second input row, column 1 is 0. First row, column 1 is 2. So maybe the 1s are generated based on the proximity to 2s in the same column, but only a certain number of layers below.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are generated in a way that for each 2 in the input, all 0s in the same column below it, up to a certain depth, become 1s. For example, the first column of the input in Example 0 has 2s in the first three rows. Then in the fourth row, the first column is 0, which remains 0. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing all 0s that are directly adjacent (including diagonally) to a 2 with 1. Let's check in Example 0. The second row's first 0 is between two 2s (left and right). So adjacent horizontally to 2s. That would become 1. The 0s in the third row: perhaps adjacent to 2s. For example, the 0s in positions 1 and 2 of the third row. The cell above (second row) is 0 and 2. Wait, position 1 of third row: cell above is 0. But the left is 2 (from the first element of third row, which is 2). So diagonally adjacent to a 2. So maybe 0s that are adjacent (including diagonally) to any 2 become 1. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's fourth row, position 1 is 0 in input and becomes 1. Let's check the cells around it in the input. The cells above (third row, position 1) is 0. The cell to the left (third row, position 0) is 2. So diagonally adjacent to a 2. So yes, that 0 becomes 1. Similarly, position 2 in fourth row: in input, 0. The cell above (third row, position 2) is 0. But the cell to the left (third row, position 1) is 0. Wait, maybe the cells above in higher rows. For example, the first row's column 1 is 2, which is two rows above. But how would that influence. Hmm, this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a flood fill from the top. The 2s are the top layers, and any 0 connected to them via adjacent cells (including diagonally) becomes 1. But then in Example 0's fourth row, all 0s would become 1s if they are connected via any path. But in the fourth row's output, there are still 0s. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compare the input and output for the 5s. In both training examples, the 5s in the input are replaced with 0s in the output. So first step: all 5s become 0s. Then, the 0s are transformed into 1s based on some condition.\n\nSo the first part of the pattern is: replace all 5s with 0s.\n\nThen, the 0s are turned into 1s if they meet a certain condition. Let's see what that condition is.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input after replacing 5s with 0s. The rows with 5s (rows 6-9) become all 0s. Then, in the output, some 0s become 1s. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input for Example 0's first three rows:\n\nRow 0: all 2s. Output same.\n\nRow 1: [2,0,2,2,...0]. Output becomes [2,1,2,2...,1]. So 0s at positions 1 and 14 become 1.\n\nRow 2: [2,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0]. Output has 0s replaced by 1s in positions 1,2,6,7,8,14.\n\nSo what's common between these positions? Let's look at the original input. For row 1, position 1 is 0. The cells adjacent to it in the input are 2 (left), 2 (right). So adjacent to 2s. So maybe any 0 adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a 2 becomes 1. Then, after that, for the next rows, perhaps the 0s adjacent to the newly created 1s also become 1s, propagating downward.\n\nBut wait, in row 2 of the input, the 0s are adjacent to 2s (for example, position 1: left is 2, right is 0. Up is 0. Down is 0. So horizontally adjacent to 2 (left) in same row. So that 0 becomes 1.\n\nBut in row 3 of input (all 0s), the output has 1s in positions 1,2,3,6,7,8,14. Let's see: in row 3, position 1. The cell above (row 2) was 0 in input but became 1 in output. So if the rule is that 0s become 1s if they are adjacent (including vertically) to a 1 or 2. So after the initial replacement of 0s adjacent to 2s, then in subsequent rows, 0s adjacent to 1s (from above) also become 1s.\n\nSo the process could be:\n\n1. Replace all 5s with 0s.\n\n2. For each cell in the grid, starting from the top rows and moving down:\n\n   a. If the cell is 0 and has at least one adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) cell with a 2 or 1 in the current or previous steps, then replace it with 1.\n\nWait, but how does this process proceed? Maybe it's a multi-step process where first, 0s adjacent to 2s become 1s. Then 0s adjacent to those 1s also become 1s, and so on, propagating down.\n\nLet's test this idea with Example 0.\n\nOriginal input (after replacing 5s with 0s):\n\nRow 0: all 2s.\n\nRow 1: [2,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0]\n\nRow 2: [2,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0]\n\nRows 3-9: all 0s.\n\nFirst pass (adjacent to 2s):\n\nIn row 1, the 0s at positions 1 and 14 are adjacent to 2s (left and right for position 1, left and up for position 14). So they become 1s.\n\nRow 2: the 0s at positions 1,2,6,7,8,14. Let's check their adjacency to 2s. Position 1: left is 2 (row 2, position 0), so becomes 1. Position 2: left is 0 (row 2, position 1), but up is 0 (row 1, position 2 is 2). Wait, row 1, position 2 is 2. So position 2 in row 2 is adjacent (up) to 2. So becomes 1. Similarly, positions 6,7,8 in row 2: up (row 1) are 2s. So they become 1s. Position 14 in row 2: up (row 1, position 14 is 0) but left (row 2, position 13 is 2). So adjacent to 2. So becomes 1.\n\nThen, rows 3 and below. For row 3, all 0s. Check adjacency to 1s from row 2. For example, position 1 in row 3: up is 1 (row 2, position 1). So becomes 1. Similarly, position 2: up is 1 (row 2, position 2). Also becomes 1. Position 3: up is 2 (row 2, position 3). So becomes 1. Positions 6,7,8 in row 3: up are 1s. So become 1s. Position 14: up is 1 (row 2, position 14). So becomes 1.\n\nThis matches the output for row 3: [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1].\n\nThen for row 4: check adjacency to 1s in row 3. For example, position 1 in row 4: up is 1. So becomes 1. But looking at the output for row 4 in Example 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. So only position 14 becomes 1. Hmm, that's different. Why?\n\nAh, maybe the adjacency is only to the previous row's 1s, not the current row. So in row 4, the 0s are checked against the previous row (row 3's output). For example, position 1 in row 4: up (row 3, position 1) is 1. So would become 1. But in the output, row 4's position 1 is 0. So that contradicts. So maybe the rule is different. Maybe the adjacency is only horizontal and vertical, not diagonal. Let me re-examine.\n\nAlternatively, the propagation stops after a certain number of layers. For example, the 1s can only propagate down a certain number of rows from the 2s. But how to determine the number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are only created in the first three layers below the 2s. Let's check Example 0's rows:\n\nRow 0: 2s.\n\nRow 1: 2s and 1s.\n\nRow 2: 2s and 1s.\n\nRow 3: some 1s.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. Only the last position is 1. How did that happen? Looking at row 3's output, position 14 is 1. So in row 4, position 14 is 0 in input. Up (row 3, position 14) is 1, so becomes 1. So that matches. But other positions in row 4: position 1 in row 4 is 0. Up (row 3, position 1) is 1, but output is 0. So why isn't it 1? That's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the propagation is only allowed to happen once. Like, 0s adjacent to 2s become 1s in the first pass. Then, in the next pass, 0s adjacent to those 1s become 1s, but this only happens once. So it's a two-step process: first replace 0s adjacent to 2s, then replace 0s adjacent to those new 1s. But this might not explain all cases.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is done in such a way that 0s become 1s if they are in the same column as a 2 and in a row below it, but not more than a certain number of rows down. For example, each 2 can \"illuminate\" a certain number of rows below. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, row 0 has 2s. The 0s in row 1 are adjacent (same column) to 2s, so they become 1s. Then row 2: the 0s in same columns as 2s from row 0 (but row 2 is two rows down). But that doesn't explain why row 3 has 1s. So maybe each 2 can illuminate three rows below. So row 0's 2s affect rows 1,2,3. Row 1's 2s affect rows 2,3,4. But this complicates.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s are formed in a diamond-shaped pattern radiating down from the 2s. Like, each 2 can create a diamond of 1s below it. But I need to visualize this.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that any 0 that is in a column that has a 2 above it and not blocked by a non-zero (like 5) will become 1. So for example, in a column where there's a 2 in row 0, any 0s below it until a 5 or the end of the grid become 1s. But in Example 0's first column (all 2s in input), the output's first column in row 3 is 0. So that doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's look at Example 1 to see if there's a pattern.\n\nExample 1's input has 2s in the top rows and 5s in the lower rows. The output replaces some 0s with 1s, similar to Example 0.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\nThe third row of output is [1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]. The input's third row is all 0s. So these 1s must be due to proximity to 2s above. For example, the first three positions are 1s. The columns above them: in row 2's input, the first three positions are [2,0,0], but in the output of row 2, they are [2,1,1]. So the 1s in row 2 could be propagating down to row 3. So the 0s in row 3's first three positions are adjacent (above) to 1s, hence become 1s.\n\nThis supports the idea that 0s become 1s if they are directly below a 1 or 2.\n\nBut then why in Example 0's fourth row, position 1 is 1 (from row 3's 1), but in row 4, position 1 becomes 0 in the output. Wait, no. Example 0's row 4 output is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. So position 14 is 1, which is below row 3's position 14 which is 1. So that works. But position 1 in row 4: the row above (row 3's position 1) is 1, so why isn't it 1 in row 4's output?\n\nAh, maybe the propagation is limited. Like, each 1 can only propagate down one row. So for example, a 1 in row n can cause the cell below in row n+1 to become 1, but not further. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow 2 has 1s. Those 1s cause row 3's cells below to become 1s.\n\nRow 3's 1s can then cause row 4's cells below to become 1s.\n\nBut in the output, row 4's 1 is only in position 14.\n\nWait, row 3's position 14 is 1 (output). So row 4's position 14 is 1 (output). But row 3's positions 1,2,3,6,7,8 are 1s. So their below cells in row 4 would be positions 1,2,3,6,7,8. But in row 4's output, those are 0s. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm, maybe the propagation stops after a certain number of rows. Like, each 2 can create 1s up to three rows below. For example, row 0's 2s affect rows 1-3, row 1's 2s affect 2-4, etc.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 3, position 0 is 0 in output. The column 0 has 2s in rows 0,1,2. So according to this idea, row 3's position 0 should be 1, but it's 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the transformation is that each 0 is replaced with 1 if there's a 2 somewhere above it in the same column, and there's no 5 in between. But then, in Example 0's first column, there are 2s all the way down to row 2, but row 3's first column is 0. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 0 becomes 1 if there's a 2 in the same column in any of the previous rows, but only if there are no 5s below the 2. But this is getting too complex.\n\nWait, let's look at the Test Input. The Test Input has 5s in the lower rows, which in the training examples are turned into 0s. So the first step is to replace 5s with 0s. Then, the 0s that meet certain conditions become 1s.\n\nFor the Test Input, after replacing 5s with 0s, the lower rows become 0s. Then, the 0s in upper rows would need to be replaced with 1s based on the same pattern as the training examples.\n\nLooking at the Test Input's first few rows:\n\nRow 0: all 2s.\n\nRow 1: [2,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,0,2,2,0,2,2,2]\n\nRow 2: [2,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow 3-5: all 0s.\n\nRow 6: after replacing 5s with 0s, becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRows 7-9: also 0s after replacing 5s.\n\nNow, applying the pattern from the training examples, the 0s adjacent to 2s or 1s would become 1s.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 1s in row 1 are where the 0s were adjacent to 2s. Then in row 2, the 0s adjacent to 2s or previous 1s become 1s. Then in row 3, the 0s adjacent to previous 1s become 1s. But in row 4, only position 14 is 1. So perhaps there's a limited propagation depth.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s are generated in a way that each 0 becomes 1 if it's adjacent (in any direction) to a 2 or a 1 in the original input (but not considering the transformation steps). Wait, but that can't be, because in Example 0's row 3, the input is all 0s, but the output has 1s. So the 1s must be due to previous transformations.\n\nAnother idea: the 1s are formed in a way that represents the outline or shadow of the 2s. Like, for each 2, create a 1 in all surrounding cells, then for those 1s, create another layer around them, but this might not fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is a combination of two steps: first, replace all 5s with 0s. Second, for each 0 in the grid, if there's a 2 in any of the three rows above it (current row -1, -2, -3), then it becomes 1. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's row 3 (index 3), the cells are all 0s. For position 1 in row 3: the three rows above are rows 0,1,2. In column 1: row 0 is 2, row 1 is 0, row 2 is 0. So there's a 2 three rows above. So position 1 in row 3 becomes 1. Similarly, row 4's position 1: rows 1,2,3 above. Row 1: 0, row 2: 0, row 3:1. So since there's a 1 in row 3, which is not a 2, it doesn't count. Wait, but this rule would only look for 2s, not 1s.\n\nSo in this case, row 3's position 1 is 1 because there's a 2 in row 0. Row 4's position 1: three rows above include row 1 (0), row 2 (0), row 3 (1). So no 2 in the three rows above, so stays 0. This explains why in row 4's output, position 1 is 0. But how about row 3's position 14? The three rows above: row 0 (2), row 1 (0), row 2 (0). So there's a 2 in row 0. So becomes 1. This fits.\n\nRow 4's position 14: three rows above are row 1 (0), row 2 (0), row 3 (1). No 2s, but there's a 1. But according to this rule, it only checks for 2s. So why is row 4's position 14 a 1 in output? Because in row 3's output, position 14 is 1. So this rule doesn't explain that.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the output as the input with 5s replaced by 0s, and then any 0 that is in a cell that is directly below a cell that is a 2 or a 1 (after transformation) becomes 1.\n\nBut how does this propagate? For example, in Example 0's row 1: the 0s are replaced with 1s because they are adjacent to 2s. Then in row 2, the 0s below those 1s become 1s. Then in row 3, the 0s below row 2's 1s become 1s. And this continues until no more changes.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 4, position 14 is 1. That's because row 3's position 14 is 1. So the propagation continues down. But why are other positions in row 4 not 1s?\n\nMaybe there's a limit to how many times this can happen. Like, each 1 can only propagate down a certain number of times. Or perhaps the propagation stops when a row has all 0s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace 5s with 0s, then for each 0, if there's a 2 in the same column in any of the rows above, it becomes 1. But that doesn't explain row 3's position 0 in Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's row 3, position 0 is 0. The column 0 has 2s in rows 0,1,2. So according to this rule, it should become 1. But in the output, it's 0. So that's a contradiction.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0 and Example 1, the outputs seem to have 1s forming a sort of downward pyramid from the 2s. The number of 1s increases in the upper rows and then decreases. Maybe the 1s are generated based on the distance from the 2s. Each 0 within a certain distance (like Manhattan distance) becomes 1.\n\nFor instance, in Example 0's row 1, the 0s are at distance 1 from the 2s. Row 2's 0s are further away. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is a combination of replacing 5s with 0s and then applying a cellular automaton rule where a 0 becomes 1 if it has a 2 or 1 in any of the eight neighboring cells (Moore neighborhood) in the previous state. But this would require iterative passes over the grid until no more changes occur. However, the examples might not show this.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace 5s with 0s, then for each 0, if any of the cells in the row above (same column or adjacent columns) is a 2 or 1, then it becomes 1. So this is a row-wise propagation.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's row 1:\n\nRow 0 is all 2s. Row 1's 0s are adjacent (same column) to 2s. So they become 1s.\n\nRow 2's 0s: check row 1's cells. For example, position 1 in row 2: row 1's position 1 is 1. So becomes 1. Position 2: row 1's position 2 is 2. So becomes 1. Positions 6,7,8 in row 2: row 1's positions 6,7,8 are 2s. So they become 1s. Position 14: row 1's position 14 is 0. But adjacent in row 1's position 13 is 2. So maybe adjacent columns also count. If the rule is that a 0 becomes 1 if any cell in the row above (same column or adjacent columns) is 2 or 1.\n\nFor Example 0's row 3, position 1: row 2's position 0 is 2, position 1 is 1, position 2 is 1. So adjacent columns. So becomes 1. Similarly for other positions.\n\nRow 4's position 14: row 3's position 14 is 1. So becomes 1.\n\nRow 4's position 1: row 3's position 0 is 0, position 1 is 1, position 2 is 1. So adjacent columns have 1s. So according to the rule, position 1 should become 1, but in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that a 0 becomes 1 only if the cell directly above is a 2 or 1. No consideration for adjacent columns. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's row 1:\n\nPosition 1: directly above (row 0) is 2. So becomes 1.\n\nPosition 14: directly above (row 0) is 2. So becomes 1.\n\nRow 2's position 1: directly above (row 1) is 1. So becomes 1.\n\nRow 3's position 1: directly above (row 2) is 1. So becomes 1.\n\nRow 4's position 1: directly above (row 3) is 1. So becomes 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this contradicts.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, row 4's position 1 is 0, which contradicts this idea. So this can't be right.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the test input's row 1 and 2, which have 0s. Applying the same pattern as the training examples, these 0s should become 1s if they are adjacent to 2s.\n\nTest Input row 1: [2,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,0,2,2,0,2,2,2]. The 0s are at positions 1,6,8,11.\n\nIn Example 0, similar positions (0s between 2s) became 1s. So these 0s would become 1s. Similarly, row 2 has 0s at positions 1,2,6,7,8,11,12,13. These would become 1s if adjacent to 2s or previous 1s.\n\nThen, the rows below would have 1s propagating down.\n\nBut how far down?\n\nIn Example 0, the 1s propagate down to row 3 and row 4's position 14. So in the test input, the 1s might propagate similarly.\n\nSo, for the test input's output, the first three rows would have 1s where there are 0s adjacent to 2s. Then rows 3 and 4 might have 1s propagating from those.\n\nPutting this all together, the pattern seems to be:\n\n1. Replace all 5s with 0s.\n\n2. For each cell, if it is 0 and has a 2 or 1 in any of the eight neighboring cells (including diagonally) in the previous rows (processed so far), then it becomes 1.\n\nThis is processed row by row from top to bottom. So each row is processed after the one above, and a 0 becomes 1 if any neighboring cell in the processed rows is a 2 or 1.\n\nAlternatively, during processing, each row is transformed based on the original input and the already processed rows.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to draft the output based on the following observations:\n\n- All 5s become 0s.\n\n- 0s that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a 2 or a 1 (from the previous rows) become 1.\n\nBut how to model this for the test case.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow 0: all 2s. Output same.\n\nRow 1: [2,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,0,2,2,0,2,2,2]. The 0s at positions 1,6,8,11 are between 2s. So they become 1s. So row 1's output is [2,1,2,2,2,2,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,2].\n\nRow 2: [2,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,2]. The 0s are at positions 1,2,6,7,8,11,12,13. Adjacent to 2s or 1s from row 1. For example, position 1: adjacent to row 1's position 1 (1). So becomes 1. Position 2: adjacent to row 1's position 2 (2). So becomes 1. Positions 6,7,8: adjacent to row 1's 0s and 2s. Row 1's position 6 is 1 (from previous step), so adjacent 0s become 1s. Similarly for others. So row 2's output becomes [2,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,2].\n\nRow 3: all 0s. Check adjacency to row 2's 1s and 2s. For example, position 0: above is 2 (row 2's position 0). So becomes 1. Position 1: above is 1. So becomes 1. Position 2: above is 1. So becomes 1. Position 3: above is 2. So becomes 1. This would make row 3's output start with [1,1,1,1,...]. But looking at the training examples, the third row in Example 0's output starts with 0. Hmm, perhaps this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the adjacency is only to the current row's cells and the row above. But I'm running out of time. Given the training examples, the pattern seems to replace 0s that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to 2s with 1s, and then propagate those 1s downward, but limited in depth.\n\nFor the test input's output, the first three rows would have 1s in the 0 positions between 2s, and then the rows below would have 1s based on proximity to those 1s. \n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed to draft the output based on the training examples' patterns.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a list of lists (like a grid) and the output is another grid where some numbers have changed. The main numbers involved are 0, 2, and 5. Let's see how they transform.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a lot of 2s and 0s. In the output, some of the 0s in the upper rows turn into 1s. For instance, in the second row of the input, the 0s at positions 1 and 13 become 1s. Then in the third row, the 0s become 1s as well. But in the lower rows where there are 5s, those 5s turn into 0s in the output. Wait, no\u2014looking at the output, the 5s in the input's lower rows are gone. For example, in the input's 6th row (0-based?), the 5 at position 13 becomes 0 in the output. Similarly, in the 7th input row, the 5 at position 6 becomes 0. So maybe 5s are being turned into 0s, but maybe only in certain conditions.\n\nWait, in the first example's input, there are 5s in the lower rows. In the output, those 5s become 0s. So perhaps the rule is that all 5s become 0s. But wait, let's check Example 1. In Example 1's input, there are 5s in the lower rows. The output for those rows turns all 5s into 0s. For instance, in the 6th row input has [0,5,5,0...], and the output is [0,0,0,0...]. Similarly, the 7th row input has some 5s, and the output replaces them with 0s. So yes, 5s become 0s.\n\nBut then, what about the 0s that become 1s? Let's look at the positions. In Example 0's input, the first row is all 2s, output is same. The second input row has 0s at positions 1 and 13. Output changes those to 1. The third row has 0s at 1,2,5,6,7,14. Output changes those to 1. Then the fourth input row is all 0s. The output has some 1s. Like, in row 3 (0-based index?), the output starts with 0, then 1,1,1,0,0... So maybe there's a rule where 0s are turned into 1s if they are adjacent (in some way) to a 2?\n\nWait, let's see. In Example 0, the first three input rows have 2s. The 0s in those rows are converted to 1s. The fourth row is all 0s, but some of them become 1s. Maybe it's a proximity thing. Like, any 0 that is adjacent (vertically or horizontally) to a 2 becomes a 1. Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's second input row: [2, 0, 2, ...]. The 0 is between two 2s. So that 0 becomes 1. Similarly, in the third row, the 0s are adjacent to 2s in the rows above. Wait, the third row is [2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, ...]. The 0s here might be adjacent to 2s either in the same row or the row above. For example, the first element is 2, then 0,0. The next row (output) for row 3 is [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0...]. So those 0s that are adjacent to 2s in the previous row might become 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's that any 0 that is in a row above the first all-zero row (like in the input, after the first few rows with 2s and 0s, there's a row where all are 0s). Wait, looking at the inputs:\n\nIn Example 0, the first three rows have 2s and 0s. Then rows 4,5,6,7,8,9 are all 0s except for some 5s in the lower rows.\n\nIn the output, the first three rows have 1s replacing some 0s. Then row 3 (input's fourth row) has some 1s. How does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s that are in the same position as a 2 in any row above them (up to a certain point) get converted to 1. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother angle: in the output, the 2s remain as 2s. The 5s are turned into 0s. The 0s are turned into 1s if they are in a certain region. Maybe the 0s that are in the upper part of the grid (the first few rows) get turned into 1s, while those in the lower part remain 0 or are turned into 0 if they were 5s. But that seems too vague.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the fourth row (third index) is [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1]. The input's fourth row is all zeros. So why are there 1s here? Maybe they are adjacent to 2s from above. For example, in the third input row (row index 2), there are 2s. The row below (row 3) has zeros, and some of them are converted to 1s. Maybe the rule is that any 0 that is directly below a 2 or adjacent to a 2 in the previous row becomes a 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a spreading effect. Like, starting from the 2s, any 0s adjacent (including diagonally?) to 2s become 1s, and then those 1s spread to adjacent 0s in lower rows. But this would need to be checked.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first row is all 2s. Second row: the first element is 2, next is 1, then 2s. So the 1 is between 2s. Third row starts with 2, then 1,1, then 2s. So maybe the 0s that are adjacent (left/right or above/below) to 2s turn into 1s. Then, those 1s might also cause adjacent 0s to turn into 1s in the next rows. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the third row of input in Example 0: [2,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0]. The output for this row is [2,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. So all the 0s in this row are turned into 1s. But in the fourth input row, which is all 0s, the output has some 1s. For example, the first element is 0, then 1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1. So maybe the 1s are propagating down. The 1s in row 3 (output) are beneath the 1s in row 2. Wait, but how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 0 that is in a column where there's a 2 in any row above (up to a certain point) is converted to 1. Let's check. For Example 0's fourth row (input is all 0s), the output has 1s in positions 1,2,3,6,7,8,14. Let's see the columns. For column 1: the rows above (row 3 in input, which is row index 2) is 2,0,0,2,... So maybe column 1 has a 0 in row 2, but the row above (row 1) has a 2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 0 that is in a cell that is directly above a 5 in the input is turned into 1. Or maybe the 1s are related to the positions where 5s are below. But in Example 0's input, the 5s are in rows 6 to 9. The 1s in the output are in rows 0 to 3, which are above the 5s. Maybe the 1s are being placed in regions where the 5s are below, but that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern involves converting 0s to 1s in the upper part of the grid (rows above where 5s start) and converting 5s to 0s in the lower part. So the transformation is two parts: replacing 5s with 0s, and replacing certain 0s (those in upper rows) with 1s.\n\nLooking at the outputs, in both examples, the 5s in the input are replaced with 0s. So that's one part: 5 \u2192 0.\n\nFor the 0s \u2192 1s, it seems like the 0s that are in the upper part of the grid (where there are 2s present) are turned into 1s. The exact pattern might be that any 0 that is in a row that is above the first occurrence of a 5 in that column. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first 5 is in row 6 (index 6), column 13. So for columns where there's a 5 in row 6 or below, any 0s above that (in the same column) would turn into 1s. But how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s in any row above the first row that contains a 5 are turned into 1s. But in Example 0, the first 5 is in row 6. So all rows above row 6 (rows 0-5) would have their 0s converted to 1s, but that's not exactly what's happening. In row 3 of Example 0's input (which is row index 3, above row 6), the 0s are converted to some 1s but not all. So maybe it's not that simple.\n\nAnother approach: For each cell in the input, the output cell is:\n\n- If the input is 2, stays 2.\n- If the input is 5, becomes 0.\n- If the input is 0, check if there is a 2 in the same column in any row above. If yes, turn into 1. Otherwise, remain 0.\n\nBut let's test this hypothesis against Example 0.\n\nTake the second input row (row 1) of Example 0: [2,0,2,...]. The 0 in column 1. In the same column (column 1) in the rows above (row 0) is 2. So this 0 becomes 1. That works. The 0 in column 13 (row 1) has a 2 in row 0, column 13? Let's check: row 0 is all 2s. So yes, column 13 in row 0 is 2, so 0 becomes 1. Which matches the output.\n\nThird row (row 2) of input in Example 0: [2,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0]. All 0s in this row. For each 0, check if any row above in the same column has a 2. Since row 0 is all 2s, all columns in this row have a 2 above. So all 0s in row 2 would become 1. But in the output, the first element is 2 (so input is 2, no change), then the next two 0s become 1s. Then 2, etc. So this aligns. So all 0s in row 2 (columns 1,2,5,6,7,14) become 1s.\n\nThen row 3 (input is all 0s). For each column, if any row above (rows 0-3) has a 2. Since row 0 is all 2s, all columns in row 3 would have 2s above. So all 0s in row 3 should become 1s. But the output for row 3 is [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1]. Wait, some are 0. So this hypothesis isn't correct.\n\nWait, why are some 0s in row 3 of the output not converted to 1? For example, the first element is 0. But in row 0, column 0 is 2. So according to the hypothesis, it should be 1. But the output is 0. So the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let's look at Example 0's output row 3 (input all 0s):\n\nOutput: [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nSo the first element is 0. But in the same column (column 0), the rows above (rows 0,1,2) have 2s. So why is it 0? That breaks the previous hypothesis.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 0s are turned into 1s only if they are in a cell that is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a 2 in the same row or the row immediately above. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, row 1 (input) has 0 at column 1. The left neighbor is 2, right neighbor is 2. So converted to 1. Row 1, column 13: 0 is between 2s? No, in row 1, the input is [2,0,2,2,...], so column 13 is 0. Wait, in row 1, the input is [2,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0]. So columns 1 and 14 are 0. The output for row 1 is [2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1]. So the 0s in columns 1 and 14 are converted to 1s. For column 1: the neighbors in the same row are 2 and 2 (left and right). For column 14: the left neighbor is 2, and the right is probably nothing (assuming 15 elements). So adjacent to 2 in the same row. So maybe the rule is that a 0 becomes 1 if it's adjacent to a 2 in the same row.\n\nThen for row 2, the input has 0s. Let's look at row 2, column 1: 0. Neighbors in the same row: left is 2 (column 0), right is 0 (column 2). So only left neighbor is 2, so becomes 1. Similarly, column 2: left is 0 (column 1), right is 2 (column3). So right neighbor is 2, so becomes 1. So in row 2, all 0s are adjacent to 2s in the same row, hence all 0s become 1s. But the output for row 2 is [2,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. So the 0s in columns 5,6,7 (positions 5,6,7) are 0s in the input. Their left neighbors: columns 5 has 2 (column4), column6 has 0 (column5), column7 has 0 (column6). Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s in any row that has a 2 in it (i.e., the row has at least one 2) are converted to 1s. Let's check. For Example 0, row 0 has all 2s, so 0s are none. Row 1 has 2s and two 0s. The output converts those 0s to 1s. Row 2 has 2s and 0s; output converts all 0s to 1s. Row 3 has no 2s (all 0s), but in the output, some 0s are 1s. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 0s in the same row as a 2 are converted to 1s. But in row 3 of Example 0's input, there are no 2s, but some 0s are turned into 1s. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the output as a kind of erosion or expansion of the 2s. The 2s are the main structure, and the 0s adjacent to them become 1s. Then, maybe those 1s can cause further 0s below them to become 1s, but only up to a certain depth. Or perhaps it's like a flood fill: any 0 that is reachable from a 2 via adjacent (including diagonally?) cells, but limited to a certain number of layers.\n\nBut looking at Example 0's output, the fourth row (row 3) has 1s in columns 1-3, 6-8, and 14. Let's see the rows above. Row 2's output has 1s in columns 1-2,5-7, and 14. So in row 3, the 1s are below those 1s. Maybe the 1s propagate downward, turning adjacent 0s into 1s. For example, if there's a 1 in the row above, the cell directly below and maybe diagonally adjacent becomes 1.\n\nBut in row 3 of the output, column 1 is 1. In row 2, column 1 is 1. So below that, column 1 in row 3 is 1. Similarly, columns 2 and 3 in row 3 are 1s, perhaps because they are adjacent to the 1s in row 2, column 1-2.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe the rule is that any 0 that is in a row where there is a 2 in any of the previous rows (up to a certain depth) is turned into 1. Or perhaps, the 1s are formed in a certain range around the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the difference between input and output:\n\nIn Example 0, the first three rows have 2s and 0s. The output turns the 0s into 1s. Then, in the fourth row (input all 0s), the output has some 1s. Maybe the 1s are formed in a diamond-shaped area expanding downward from the 2s. Like, each 2 in the upper rows can \"cover\" a certain number of cells below it, converting 0s to 1s.\n\nAlternatively, think of each 2 as a source that converts 0s to 1s in a vertical column below it, but with a certain distance.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output row 3 (input all 0s), the output has 1s in columns 1,2,3,6,7,8,14. Let's see the columns where there are 2s in the upper rows. For example:\n\nColumn 0: in row 0-2, it's 2. So why is the output in row 3, column 0 a 0? So that hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are formed in regions where there are 2s in the same or adjacent columns in the rows above. Like, a 2 in column x can turn 0s in columns x-1, x, x+1 in the row below into 1s. And this propagates downward until a certain point.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's row 0 (all 2s), the row below (row 1) would have 0s in columns adjacent to 2s. But row 1's 0s are in columns 1 and 14, which are adjacent to 2s (since row 0 has all 2s, maybe all 0s in row 1 are adjacent to 2s and become 1s, except the edges? But in Example 0's row 1 input is [2,0,2,2,...], so the 0s are between 2s. So they are adjacent to 2s in the same row, hence converted to 1s.\n\nThen, in row 2, the 0s are adjacent to 2s in the same row, so they become 1s. Then, in row 3, the 0s are adjacent to 1s in row 2. Maybe each 1 acts like a new source, causing adjacent 0s below to become 1s. So in row 3, the 1s are those cells that are adjacent (maybe diagonally) to 1s in row 2.\n\nFor example, in row 2 of output Example 0, the 1s are in columns 1,2,5,6,7,14. In row 3, the 1s are columns 1,2,3 (adjacent to column 1-2's 1s), 6,7,8 (adjacent to 5-7's 1s), and 14 (adjacent to 14's 1). This seems to fit. So the pattern is that each 1 in a row can generate 1s in the next row's adjacent columns (including diagonally?), but only for a certain number of layers.\n\nSo the transformation could be:\n\n- Replace all 5s with 0s.\n- Replace 0s with 1s if they are in the same row as a 2 (adjacent to 2), or in a row below, adjacent to a 1 from above. And this propagates downward for a certain number of rows.\n\nBut how many layers does this propagate? In Example 0's output, the 1s appear up to row 3 (the fourth row), and then in the next rows, they start to fade. In row 4, output has [0,0,0,0,...0,1]. So column 14 has a 1. Maybe this is because in row 3, column 14 is 1, so in row 4, column 14's 0 becomes 1. And in row 5, that 1 in row 4's column 14 would propagate further down, but in the output, row 5 is all zeros except for the last element being 0. Wait, no, in Example 0's output, row 4's last element is 1, and row 5's last element is 0. So perhaps the propagation is limited to a certain number of layers.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Perhaps the rule is that 0s are turned into 1s if they are within a certain distance (like two or three rows) below a 2, and 5s are turned into 0s.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the difference between input and output for each example.\n\nIn Example 0, the output's row 3 (input all 0s) has some 1s. Looking at the input's row 3, which is all 0s. The output's row 3 has 1s in columns that are adjacent to 1s from the row above. For example, in row 2, column 1 and 2 are 1s. In row 3, columns 0,1,2,3 would be adjacent (including diagonally). But output's row 3, column 0 is 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the propagation is only directly below. So a 1 in row n causes the cell below (row n+1, same column) to become 1. And possibly adjacent cells.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 2, column 1 is 1. Then row 3, column 1 is 1. Similarly, row 2 column 2 is 1; row 3 column 2 is 1. So that's directly below. But in row 3, column 3 is 1. Which is adjacent to column 2. So maybe it's a combination.\n\nThis is getting a bit too vague. Let's try to formulate a possible rule:\n\n1. All 5s in the input become 0s in the output.\n2. All 0s in the input that are adjacent (left, right, above, or below) to a 2 in the same or neighboring rows are turned into 1s. This process may propagate downward for a limited number of rows.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s are formed in a kind of cone shape below the 2s. So each 2 in the upper rows creates a cone of 1s below it, expanding as it goes down.\n\nBut I need to find a rule that can be applied systematically.\n\nLet's take the test input and see what the expected output would be based on the examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,2,...] \u2192 stays the same.\nRow 1: [2,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,0,2,2,0,2,2,2] \u2192 the 0s are at positions 1,6,8,11. In the output, these should become 1s if adjacent to 2s. In row 1, each 0 is between 2s. For example, position 1: between 2 (left) and 2 (right). So becomes 1. Position 6: 0 between 2 (left) and 2 (right). So becomes 1. Position 8: 0 between 2 (left) and 2 (right). So becomes 1. Position 11: 0 between 2 (left) and 0 (right?), wait the input row is [2,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,0,2,2,0,2,2,2]. So position 11 is between 2 (left) and 2 (right) in the same row. So becomes 1. So row 1's output would have 1s at positions 1,6,8,11.\n\nRow 2: [2,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,2]. The 0s are at positions 1,2,6,7,8,11,12,13. In the same row, adjacent to 2s. For example, position 1: adjacent to 2 (left) and 0 (right). So only left is 2 \u2192 becomes 1. Position 2: adjacent to 0 (left) and 2 (right). So becomes 1. Position 6: between 2 (left) and 0 \u2192 becomes 1. Similarly, positions 7,8 would be adjacent to 0s and 2s. Wait, perhaps in the same row, if a 0 is adjacent to a 2 (left or right), it becomes 1. So all 0s in this row are adjacent to 2s. So they all become 1s. Except maybe those not adjacent. Let's see. Position 11: 0. Left is 2 (position 10), right is 0 (position 12). So left is 2 \u2192 becomes 1. Position 12: left is 0 (position 11), right is 0 (position 13). So no adjacent 2s. So this 0 would stay 0? But according to the examples, in row 2 of Example 0, all 0s were turned into 1s even if they were not adjacent to 2s in the same row. Wait, in Example 0's row 2 input, the 0s are in columns 1,2,5,6,7,14. The output converts all to 1s, even if some are not adjacent to 2s in the same row. For example, column 5 in row 2: input is 2,2,2, then 0. So the 0 is adjacent to 2s on the left. So becomes 1. Column 6 is 0, adjacent to 0 on left and 0 on right. Wait, but how did that become 1 in the output?\n\nWait, Example 0's input row 2 is [2,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0]. The output row is [2,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. So the 0s at columns 6,7,8 in row 2 are between other 0s and 2s. For example, column 6's left is a 2 (column5) and right is 0 (column7). So column6 is adjacent to a 2 (column5) \u2192 becomes 1. Column7 is adjacent to 0 and 0 \u2192 but how did it become 1? Unless the propagation is from the row above. Because in row 1's output, columns 6 and 7 might be 2s, so the 0s in row 2's columns 6-8 are adjacent to 2s from the row above. Wait, in row 1's output, it's [2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1]. So columns 6,7, etc. are 2s. So in row 2's input, columns 6-8 are 0s. So these 0s are below 2s in the row above. So perhaps the rule is that a 0 becomes 1 if it is adjacent to a 2 in the same row, or if the cell directly above is a 2 or 1.\n\nThis complicates things, but perhaps the correct rule is that a 0 is turned into 1 if it is adjacent (left, right, above, or below) to a 2 or 1 in the same or adjacent rows. So it's a two-pass process: first, replace 0s adjacent to 2s, then those new 1s cause adjacent 0s in the next rows to become 1s, and so on.\n\nBut this would require processing the grid from top to bottom, left to right, and propagating the 1s downward. However, given that the examples show the output as a static transformation, not a dynamic one, the exact pattern must be derivable from the input alone.\n\nAnother observation: in both examples, the output replaces 0s in the upper part of the grid (rows 0 to some mid-row) with 1s, and 5s in the lower part with 0s. The 1s seem to form a kind of inverted pyramid shape, expanding as they go down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is:\n\n- For each cell, if the input is 5 \u2192 0.\n- If the input is 2 \u2192 2.\n- If the input is 0, check if there is a 2 in the same column in any of the rows above. If yes, turn into 1. Otherwise, remain 0.\n\nBut this didn't work for Example 0's row 3, column 0. Because in column 0, all rows above (including row 0) have 2s, but the output is 0. So this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is:\n\n- 0s become 1s if they are in a column that has a 2 in any row above them, up to the first occurrence of a 5 in that column. Once a 5 appears in a column, all 0s below it (including that row) remain 0s.\n\nBut how to check this.\n\nIn Example 0's column 13:\n\n- In input, the first 5 is in row 6 (index 6). So for rows 0-5 in column 13, 0s become 1s if there's a 2 above. Row 0 is 2. So rows 1 and 2: 0s become 1s. Row 3: 0 becomes 1. Row 4 and 5: 0s become 0s because after row 6 (the first 5), but wait, row 6 is the first 5 in column 13. So rows above row 6 would be 0-5. So 0s in rows 0-5 would be converted to 1s if there's a 2 above. But in column 13 of Example 0's input, row 0 is 2. So rows 1-5 in column 13 would have 0s converted to 1s if no 5 is above. Wait, but row 6 is the first 5. So the 0s in column 13, rows 1-5, are converted to 1s. Then, in row 6 and below, they remain 0s.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, row 3 (index 3) of column 13 is 0. Wait, but according to this rule, it should be 1. So this is conflicting.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Let's try to summarize what I have so far:\n\n- 5s are replaced by 0s.\n- 0s in the upper part of the grid (above where 5s appear) are replaced by 1s if they are adjacent to 2s or in columns that have 2s above.\n- The exact rule for 0\u21921 is unclear but seems to involve proximity to 2s in the same or previous rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is:\n\nFor each cell (row, col):\n\n- If input is 2 \u2192 output is 2.\n- If input is 5 \u2192 output is 0.\n- If input is 0:\n   - If there is any 2 in the same column in any of the previous rows (above current row), then output is 1.\n   - Else, output is 0.\n\nBut let's test this against Example 0:\n\nRow 3, column 0: input is 0. Previous rows (0,1,2) have 2s in column 0. So according to this rule, output should be 1. But Example 0's output for row 3, column 0 is 0. So this is not correct.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 0s are replaced by 1s only in the rows where there are 2s. Once a row has no 2s, the 0s below are 0 unless they are adjacent to 1s from above.\n\nIn Example 0's row 3 (input all 0s), but output has 1s. So the 1s in row 3 are due to being adjacent to 1s in row 2. So perhaps the rule is:\n\n- 0s become 1s if they are adjacent (including diagonally) to any 2 or 1 in the row above.\n\nThis would propagate the 1s downward.\n\nLet's test this in Example 0:\n\nRow 1: 0s at columns 1 and 14. These are between 2s in the same row. So they become 1s.\n\nRow 2: 0s are adjacent to 2s (same row) or adjacent to 1s from row 1. So all 0s become 1s.\n\nRow 3: 0s are adjacent to 1s from row 2. For example, in row 3, column 1 is adjacent to row 2's column 1 (1). So becomes 1. Column 2 is adjacent to row 2's column 2 (1). Column 3 is adjacent to row 2's column 2 and 3 (but row 2's column 3 is 2). So maybe column 3 in row 3 becomes 1. This seems to fit.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\n- Replace 5s with 0s.\n- Replace 0s with 1s if:\n   a. They are adjacent (left, right, top, bottom, or diagonal) to a 2 in the same row.\n   b. Or they are adjacent (same as above) to a 1 in the row above.\n- This propagates downward, so each 1 can generate new 1s below.\n\nThis would create a spreading effect where 1s spread downward and to adjacent columns.\n\nIn Example 0's row 3:\n\n- The 1s are in columns 1,2,3 (adjacent to row 2's 1s in columns 1 and 2), 6,7,8 (adjacent to row 2's 1s in columns 5,6,7), and 14 (adjacent to row 2's 1 in column 14).\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, in row 4, the 1 in column 14 is adjacent to the 1 in row 3's column 14. So row 4's column 14 becomes 1. But in Example 0's output, row 4's column 14 is 1. Then row 5's column 14 would be adjacent to row 4's 1, but in the output, it's 0. So this suggests that the propagation stops after a certain number of rows.\n\nWait, maybe there's a maximum depth of propagation. For example, 1s can propagate down for up to two or three rows.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\n- The first three rows have 1s generated from 2s.\n- Row 3's 1s are from row 2's 1s.\n- Row 4's 1s are only in column 14, which is from row 3's column 14.\n- Row 5 has no 1s except maybe column 14, but in Example 0's output, row 5 is all 0s except the last element is 0. Wait, the output for row 4 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. Row 5's output is all 0s. So maybe the propagation stops after a certain number of steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s can only propagate down for a fixed number of steps, say three rows.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary. Maybe the correct pattern is:\n\n- Replace all 5s with 0s.\n- For each 0, replace it with 1 if any of the following is true:\n   - It is adjacent (any direction) to a 2 in the same row.\n   - It is adjacent (any direction) to a 1 in the row above.\n- This is done iteratively for each row from top to bottom.\n\nApplying this rule would mean that each row's 1s can influence the next row's 1s.\n\nLet's test this rule for Example 0:\n\nRow 0: all 2s \u2192 output same.\n\nRow 1: 0s at columns 1 and 14. Both are between 2s \u2192 become 1s. Output is correct.\n\nRow 2: 0s at 1,2,5,6,7,14. Each is adjacent to 2s in the same row. So become 1s. Correct.\n\nRow 3: all 0s. Check adjacent to 1s in row 2. Columns 1 is below 1 in row 2. Columns 2 is below 1. Columns 5 is below 1. Columns 6-7-8 are below 1s. Column 14 is below 1. So in row 3, each of these columns' adjacent cells (including diagonally) from row 2 would create 1s. So row 3's output would have 1s in columns 0 (if adjacent to row 2's column 1), 1, 2, 3 (adjacent to row 2's column 2), etc. But in Example 0's output, row 3's 1s are in columns 1,2,3,6,7,8,14. Which fits.\n\nRow 4: check adjacent to row 3's 1s. For column 14, it's below row 3's 1. So becomes 1. Other columns might have 1s, but in Example 0's output, only column 14 has 1. So perhaps the propagation is allowed to continue, but in row 4, only column 14's 1 is present. Then row 5 has no 1s.\n\nThis suggests that the propagation continues until there are no more adjacent 0s to 1s.\n\nBut the output in Example 0's row 4 has a 1 in column 14, and row 5's output for column 14 is 0. So maybe after a certain point, the propagation stops. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s can propagate downward any number of times, but in the input, the rows below have 0s that are not adjacent to any 1s. But in Example 0's row 4, the 1 in column 14 would cause row 5's column 14 to become 1 if it's adjacent. But in the output, row 5's column 14 is 0. So this suggests that the propagation is limited.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the best guess based on the examples.\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n\n1. Replace all 5s with 0s.\n2. For the 0s in the upper part of the grid (rows where there are 2s), convert 0s to 1s if they are adjacent to 2s in the same row or 1s in the row above. This creates a spreading effect downward.\n\nApplying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2] \u2192 remains same.\n\nRow 1: [2,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,0,2,2,0,2,2,2]. The 0s at positions 1,6,8,11. Each is adjacent to 2s in the same row. So they become 1s.\n\nRow 2: [2,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,2]. The 0s are at positions 1,2,6,7,8,11,12,13. Each 0 in this row is adjacent to a 2 in the same row. For example, position 1 is next to 2 (left), position 2 next to 2 (right), positions 6 next to 2 (left), etc. So all these 0s become 1s.\n\nRow 3: all 0s. Now, check for adjacency to 1s in row 2. The 1s in row 2 are positions 1,2,6,7,8,11,12,13. So in row 3, the cells below these would be positions 1,2,6,7,8,11,12,13. And their adjacent cells (diagonally). For example, position 0 in row 3 is below position 1 (1) in row 2 \u2192 adjacent diagonally, so becomes 1. Position 1 in row 3 is below position 1 (1) \u2192 becomes 1. Similarly, position 2 in row 3 is below position 2 (1) \u2192 becomes 1. Position 3 in row 3 is below position 2 (1) \u2192 becomes 1 via diagonal. Similarly for other positions. So row 3's output would have 1s in columns 0-3, 5-9, 10-14? Wait, need to check each cell.\n\nAlternatively, each cell in row 3 checks for any 1 in row 2's adjacent cells (including diagonally). For example:\n\nRow 3, column 0: adjacent to row 2's column 0 (2), and column 1 (1). So becomes 1.\n\nRow 3, column 1: adjacent to row 2's columns 0 (2), 1 (1), and 2 (1). So becomes 1.\n\nContinuing this way, row 3 would have 1s in many columns. But in the training examples, the number of 1s decreases after a certain point. For example, in Example 0's row 3, there are 1s in columns 1-3, 6-8, and 14.\n\nBut applying the same logic to the test input's row 3, perhaps the 1s would spread to adjacent columns. However, without knowing the exact propagation depth, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to construct the output for the test input based on the observed patterns:\n\nFor each row:\n\n- Replace 5s with 0s.\n\nFor 0s:\n\n- In rows with 2s, replace 0s adjacent to 2s with 1s.\n- In subsequent rows, replace 0s adjacent to 1s from the previous row with 1s.\n\nLet's apply this step by step.\n\nTest Input after replacing 5s with 0s:\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe 5s are in rows 6-9. Replacing them with 0s:\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (original had 5 at columns 7, 11, 13, which become 0).\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (original had 5s at columns 7,8,11,12,13 \u2192 replaced with 0s).\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (original 5s at columns 2,3,4,7,11,12,13 \u2192 replaced).\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (5s replaced).\n\nNow, process the 0s to 1s.\n\nProcessing row 0:\n\nAll 2s \u2192 same.\n\nRow 1: 0s at 1,6,8,11. Each is adjacent to 2s \u2192 become 1s.\n\nRow 1 output: [2,1,2,2,2,2,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,2]\n\nRow 2: 0s at 1,2,6,7,8,11,12,13. Adjacent to 2s \u2192 all become 1s.\n\nRow 2 output: [2,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,2]\n\nRow 3: all 0s. Check adjacent to row 2's 1s.\n\nFor each cell in row 3:\n\nColumn 0: adjacent to row 2's column 0 (2), no. Check adjacent in row 2: column 0 is 2, column 1 is 1. So diagonally adjacent to 1. So becomes 1.\n\nColumn 1: adjacent to row 2's columns 0 (2), 1 (1), 2 (1). So becomes 1.\n\nColumn 2: adjacent to row 2's columns 1 (1), 2 (1), 3 (2). So becomes 1.\n\nColumn 3: adjacent to row 2's columns 2 (1), 3 (2). So diagonally adjacent to 1 \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nColumns 4: adjacent to row 2's columns 3 (2), 4 (2). So no 1s adjacent \u2192 remains 0.\n\nSimilarly, columns 5: adjacent to row 2's 2s \u2192 no 1s \u2192 0.\n\nColumns 6: adjacent to row 2's column 5 (2), 6 (1), 7 (1). So becomes 1.\n\nColumns 7: adjacent to row 2's 6 (1), 7 (1), 8 (1). becomes 1.\n\nColumns 8: adjacent to 7 (1), 8 (1), 9 (2). becomes 1.\n\nColumns 9: adjacent to 8 (1) and 9 (2). So diagonally adjacent to 1 \u2192 becomes 1?\n\nWait, row 3, column 9: row 2's column 9 is 2. So no 1s. So remains 0.\n\nColumns 10: row 2's column 10 is 2 \u2192 no 1s. Remains 0.\n\nColumns 11: adjacent to row 2's columns 10 (2), 11 (1), 12 (1). becomes 1.\n\nColumns 12: adjacent to row 2's 11 (1), 12 (1), 13 (1). becomes 1.\n\nColumns 13: adjacent to row 2's 12 (1), 13 (1), 14 (2). becomes 1.\n\nColumns 14: adjacent to row 2's 13 (1), 14 (2). So diagonally adjacent to 1 \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nSo row 3's output would be:\n\n[1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs don't have 1s in all these positions. For instance, in Example 0's row 3, some positions are 0. So perhaps my adjacency logic is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only cells directly below or adjacent (left/right) to 1s, not diagonally.\n\nIf adjacency is only vertical and horizontal:\n\nRow 3, column 0: adjacent to row 2's column 0 (2) and column 1 (1) (left/right in same row?). No, row 3's column 0 is below row 2's column 0. So vertical adjacency. If vertical adjacency is considered, then row 3's column 0 is adjacent to row 2's column 0 (2) \u2192 no. But if adjacent includes diagonal, then row 2's column 1 (1) is diagonally adjacent. But if adjacency is only vertical and horizontal, then row 3's column 0 is only adjacent to row 2's column 0 (2) \u2192 no 1. So remains 0.\n\nThis complicates things. Let's assume adjacency is only vertical and horizontal.\n\nSo for row 3's cells:\n\n- A 0 becomes 1 if the cell directly above is a 1, or if any cell to the left or right in the same row is a 2.\n\nWait, this is getting too ambiguous.\n\nGiven time constraints, I'll proceed to create the output based on the training examples' patterns.\n\nIn the training examples, the output for row 3 in Example 0 is [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1]. This suggests that the 1s are in columns adjacent to 1s from the row above, but not all.\n\nPerhaps the rule is that a 0 becomes 1 if the cell directly above is a 1 or 2.\n\nFor row 3's cells:\n\n- If the cell directly above (row 2) is 1, then becomes 1.\n- If the cell directly above is 2, remains 0 unless adjacent to a 1.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed to generate the test output based on the following assumptions:\n\n- Replace 5s with 0s.\n- In rows with 2s, 0s adjacent to 2s become 1s.\n- In subsequent rows, 0s adjacent (directly below or diagonal) to 1s become 1s.\n- This propagation continues for a few rows but stops after a certain point.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow 0: same as input.\n\nRow 1: [2,1,2,2,2,2,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,2]\n\nRow 2: [2,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,2]\n\nRow 3: check each 0 for adjacency to 1s in row 2.\n\nColumns where row 2 has 1s: 1,2,6,7,8,11,12,13.\n\nFor row 3's columns:\n\n- Column 1: above is 1 \u2192 becomes 1.\n- Column 2: above is 1 \u2192 becomes 1.\n- Columns 6: above is 1 \u2192 becomes 1.\n- Columns 7: above is 1 \u2192 becomes 1.\n- Columns 8: above is 1 \u2192 becomes 1.\n- Columns 11: above is 1 \u2192 becomes 1.\n- Columns 12: above is 1 \u2192 becomes 1.\n- Columns 13: above is 1 \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nAdditionally, any columns adjacent (left/right) to these columns in row 3:\n\nFor example, column 0: adjacent to column 1 (1) \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nColumn 3: adjacent to column 2 (1) \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nColumn 5: adjacent to column 6 (1) \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nColumn 9: adjacent to column 8 (1) \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nColumn 10: adjacent to column 9 (0) and 11 (1) \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nColumn 14: adjacent to column 13 (1) \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nSo row 3 becomes:\n\n[1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nBut this seems too many 1s compared to the training examples. Perhaps the propagation is limited to direct below and not left/right in the same row.\n\nAssuming only direct below:\n\nRow 3 would have 1s in columns 1,2,6,7,8,11,12,13, and 14 (if row 2's column 14 is 2, no). Row 2's column 14 is 2, so no.\n\nSo row 3's output would be:\n\n[0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0]\n\nBut this is just a guess. Given the time, I'll proceed to format the answer based on the examples, replacing 0s adjacent to 2s with 1s in upper rows and 5s with 0s.",
