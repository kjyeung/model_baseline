        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a list of lists (rows) with 0s and 1s, and the output replaces some 0s with 8s. The question is, how do the 8s get placed?\n\nLet me start by comparing Example 0's input and output. In the input, there's a 1 in the first row at position 3 (0-based index 3). The output shows that same 1, but there are 8s in the same column below it. For instance, row 1 has an 8 in column 3, row 2 also, and so on until row 4. Wait, but in the output, the first row's 1 is at [0][3], and then rows 1-4 have 8s in column 3. Then, in row 4, there's a 1 at column 1 and 7. Looking at their columns, maybe the 8s are filling the space between 1s in the same column?\n\nWait, but the 1s in row 0 column 3 and row 1 column 8 (from the input of example 0). The output has 8s in column 3 starting from row 1 down to row 4, where there's a 1 at row 4 column 1 and 7. Hmm, maybe not. Let me check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The first row has a 1 at column 4 and 9. The output for that row is [0,0,0,0,1,8,8,8,8,1,0]. So between the two 1s in columns 4 and 9, the 0s are replaced with 8s. Oh! So maybe whenever there are two 1s in the same row, the 0s between them are replaced with 8s. That would explain the first row of Example 1's output: between the two 1s, the 0s become 8s.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's input, the first row has only one 1. However, looking at the output for Example 0, the first row remains the same, but rows below have 8s in the same column. So perhaps there's another rule here. Maybe vertical lines between 1s as well.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the first row has a 1 at column 3. Then, in the fifth row (row 4), there's a 1 at column 1 and 7. In the output, in column 3, starting from row 1 down to row 4, there are 8s. So maybe the 8s are filling vertically between two 1s in the same column. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example 0's input, column 3 has a 1 in row 0 and another 1 in row 9. Wait, row 9 of the input (example 0) is [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]. So the output for column 3 in rows 0-9 would be 1 in row 0, then 8s from row 1 to row 8, then 1 again in row 9. That's exactly what the output shows. So for column 3, between the two 1s in rows 0 and 9, all the 0s in between are replaced with 8s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 0's input, row 4 has 1s at columns 1 and 7. In the output, row 4 has 8s between them. So in the same row, between two 1s, the 0s are replaced with 8s. So the pattern seems to be: in each row and each column, wherever there are two 1s, the 0s between them (inclusive of the endpoints?) are replaced with 8s. Wait, no. The endpoints are still 1s. So between the 1s, the 0s become 8s. So for any two 1s in the same row or column, the 0s between them are turned into 8s.\n\nBut how about if there's only one 1 in a row or column? Like in Example 0's row 1, the input has a 1 in column 8. In the output, the same row has 1, and the column 3 (from other rows) has 8s. Wait, maybe it's the combination of both row and column processing. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: For each cell in the output, if the cell was a 1 in the input, it stays 1. Otherwise, if it's between two 1s (either horizontally in the same row or vertically in the same column), then it becomes 8. If not, it remains 0.\n\nSo, for example, in the first row of Example 1's input, there are two 1s at columns 4 and 9. So all the cells between them (columns 5-8) are 8s. Similarly, in Example 0's column 3, between row 0 and row 9's 1s, all the cells in between are 8s.\n\nAdditionally, if a cell is in between 1s both horizontally and vertically, maybe the 8s are added for both. For instance, in Example 0's row 4, between columns 1 and 7, there are 8s. Also, maybe if there's a 1 in a column, and another 1 below, the vertical 0s become 8s.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each cell, if it's a 0 in the input and lies between two 1s in the same row or in the same column, replace it with 8. Otherwise, leave it as 0 or 1.\n\nNow let's verify with Example 3. The input has a row [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. The output for that row is [0,1,8,8,1,0,0,0,0]. So between the two 1s in columns 1 and 4, the 0s are replaced with 8s. Similarly, in another row, there's [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0], which in the output becomes [0,1,8,8,8,8,8,1,0]. So between the two 1s in columns 1 and 7, all 0s become 8s. That fits.\n\nNow, columns. For instance, in Example 0's column 3, between rows 0 and 9, all cells are 8s. So vertical 1s create vertical 8s between them. Similarly, in Example 3's input, there's a 1 in row 5, column 2 (input row 5: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0]), and in the output, between that 1 and another 1 in the same column? Wait, maybe not. Let's check. Wait in Example 3's input, the 1s in the output's column 2 (row 5) might be part of a horizontal line. But perhaps there are vertical lines too.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is: for every cell that is a 0 in the input, check if it's between two 1s in its row or in its column. If yes, replace with 8. So the 8s are the union of all horizontal and vertical bridges between 1s.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For each cell in the input that is 1, leave it as 1 in the output.\n\n2. For each cell that is 0 in the input:\n\n   a. Check if there exists at least one pair of 1s in the same row such that the cell is between them. If yes, mark as 8.\n\n   b. Check if there exists at least one pair of 1s in the same column such that the cell is between them. If yes, mark as 8.\n\n   c. If either a or b is true, the cell becomes 8. Otherwise, remains 0.\n\nBut wait, in the output, some cells that are 0 in the input and between 1s in both row and column are 8. So it's sufficient to be between in either direction.\n\nBut how to check for pairs. For example, in a row, for each 0 cell, check if there is a 1 to the left and a 1 to the right. Similarly, in a column, check if there's a 1 above and below. Then, the cell is between them.\n\nBut how to handle multiple 1s in the row or column. For example, if there are three 1s in a row, like 1,0,1,0,1. Then the 0s between the first and third 1s would be between two 1s. But perhaps the rule is to connect consecutive pairs. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps any 0 that is between any two 1s in the same row or column, regardless of other 1s, is turned into 8. For example, in a row like [1,0,0,1,0,1], then the 0s between the first and second 1 (positions 1 and 2) become 8s, the 0 between the second and third 1 (position 4) becomes 8, and the 0s between first and third are also between. But how would the algorithm decide? It depends on whether for each 0, there exists at least one pair of 1s such that the 0 is between them.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row has a single 1. So in that row, no 0s are between two 1s. But in column 3, that 1 is paired with the 1 in row 9. So all 0s in between those two vertically become 8s.\n\nSo the rule is: for each 0 cell, check in its row if there are 1s both to the left and right (so the cell is between them), and/or check in its column if there are 1s both above and below (cell is between them). If either is true, replace with 8.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nThe test input is a 19-row list. Let's take the first row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So in this row, there are 1s at positions 7, 10, and 14. Let's process the row:\n\nBetween 7 and 10: the 0s at positions 8,9 become 8.\n\nBetween 10 and 14: 0s at 11,12,13 become 8.\n\nBut also, between 7 and 14, which would include positions 8-13. So the output for the first row should have 8s from 7 to 14, but wait the 1s are at 7,10,14. So the row would have 1 at 7, 10,14. Between 7 and 10: 8s. Between 10 and14: 8s. So the row becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,8,1,8,8,8,1,...]. Wait but the output would be:\n\nOriginal 1s at 7,10,14. So between 7 and10, 8s. Between 10 and14, 8s. So the first row's output starts as:\n\n[ ... 1,8,8,1,8,8,8,1 ... ].\n\nSo in the first row, the 0s between 7-10, 10-14, and 7-14 are covered.\n\nSimilarly, in the columns where there are 1s. Let's look for vertical pairs.\n\nFor example, in the first row, column 7 has a 1. Are there any other 1s in column 7 in other rows? Let's check the test input.\n\nLooking through each row's 7th index (since first row is index 0, 7th column is index 7). Let's see:\n\nRow 0: 7th index is 1.\n\nRow 1: column 7 is 0.\n\nRow 2: column 7 is 0.\n\nRow 3: column 7 is 0.\n\nRow 4: column 7 is 0.\n\nRow 5: column 7 is 0.\n\nRow 6: column 7 is 0 (input row 6 has 1 at column 6).\n\nRow 7: column 7 is 0.\n\nRow 8: column 7 is 0.\n\nRow 9: column 7 is 0.\n\nRow 10: column 7 is 0.\n\nRow 11: column 7 is 0.\n\nRow 12: column 7 is 0.\n\nRow 13: column 7 is 0.\n\nRow 14: column 7 is 0 (but row 14 has 1 at column 14 and 6).\n\nWait, no. The test input's row 14 is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo column 7 here is 0. So the 1 in row 0, column 7 is isolated vertically. So no other 1s in column 7, so no vertical 8s there.\n\nBut in column 10 of row 0, there's a 1. Are there other 1s in column 10? Let's check:\n\nRow 0: column 10 is 1.\n\nRow 2: column 10 is 1.\n\nRow 8: column 10 is 1.\n\nRow 14: column 10 is 0.\n\nSo in column 10, rows 0,2,8 have 1s. So between row 0 and row 2: rows 1, any 0s in column 10 would be 8s. Then between row 2 and row 8: rows 3-7 in column 10 would be 8s. So the cells in column 10, rows 1, 3-7 would be 8s.\n\nSimilarly, column 14 in row 0 has a 1 (row 0, column 14). Let's check if other rows have 1s in column 14.\n\nRow 14 has a 1 in column 14. So between row 0 and row 14, any rows in between (rows 1-13) in column 14 would have 8s if they are 0.\n\nLooking at column 14:\n\nRow 0: 1.\n\nRow 14:1.\n\nOther rows: check.\n\nRow 1: column 14 is 0.\n\nRow 2: column 14 is 0.\n\nRow 3: column 14 is 0.\n\nRow 4: column 14 is 0.\n\nRow 5: column 14 is 0.\n\nRow 6: column 14 is 0.\n\nRow 7: column 14 is 0.\n\nRow 8: column 14 is 0.\n\nRow 9: column 14 is 0.\n\nRow 10: column 14 is 0.\n\nRow 11: column 14 is 0.\n\nRow 12: column 14 is 0.\n\nRow 13: column 14 is 0.\n\nRow 14:1.\n\nSo the cells in column 14 between rows 0 and 14 (rows 1-13) would be 8s. So all those cells are 0 in input and between two 1s vertically, so they become 8s.\n\nSo for example, row 1, column 14 is 0, but since it's between row 0 and 14's 1s, it becomes 8.\n\nSimilarly for other rows in column 14 between 0 and 14.\n\nNow, let's look at the first row of the test input. The 1s are at columns 7,10,14. So the 0s between 7 and10, 10 and14, and 7 and14 are all filled with 8s. So the output row would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,8,1,8,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, between 7 and10: positions 8,9 become 8s. Between 10 and14: positions 11,12,13 become 8s. Also, between 7 and14: positions 8-13. So the row becomes:\n\n0s up to position 6, then 1, 8 (7+1), 8 (8+1), 1 (position10), 8 (11), 8 (12), 8 (13), 1 (14), then 0s.\n\nYes. So that's the first row.\n\nNow, another example: row 5 of the test input is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The input has a 1 at column1. Are there any other 1s in row5? Let's check: no. So horizontally, no 8s. But in column1, there's a 1 in row5. Are there any other 1s in column1? Looking at other rows:\n\nRow 1: column2 is 1 (row1 is [0,0,1,...]).\n\nRow5: column1 is 1.\n\nRow7: column1 is 1 (row7 is [0,1,0,...]).\n\nRow17: column1 is 1 (row17 is [0,1,0,1,0,...]).\n\nSo column1 has 1s in rows5,7,17. So the cells between rows5 and7 (rows6), and between rows7 and17 (rows8-16) would become 8s if they are 0.\n\nSo for example, row6, column1: 0 in input. Since it's between row5 and7 (both have 1s in column1), this cell becomes 8.\n\nSimilarly, rows8-16 in column1 would be 8s.\n\nNow, applying this to row5: the 1 is at column1, but in the row, there's no other 1. So the row remains 0 except for the 1. But in the column, there are other 1s, so the vertical cells in column1 would have 8s. But row5's cell is 1, so it's unchanged.\n\nBut for row5's column1, the output is still 1.\n\nAnother example: row14's input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So in this row, there's a 1 at column6 and column14. The 0s between them (columns7-13) should become 8s. So the row becomes:\n\n0s up to column6, then 1, then 8s from 7-13, then 1 at 14, then 0s.\n\nSo output row14: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nNow, putting all this together for the entire test input.\n\nEach cell that is 0 in the input becomes 8 if:\n\n- In its row, there are 1s to the left and right of it.\n\nOR\n\n- In its column, there are 1s above and below it.\n\nOtherwise, it remains 0.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nIf input[i][j] is 1: output is 1.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck row i for any two 1s such that j is between them. If exists, output 8.\n\nElse, check column j for any two 1s such that i is between them. If exists, output 8.\n\nElse, output 0.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nThe test input has 19 rows and 21 columns.\n\nFirst, process each cell.\n\nLet's go row by row.\n\nRow 0:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput will have 1s at columns7,10,14. Between them:\n\nBetween 7 and10: columns8-9 \u2192 8s.\n\nBetween 10 and14: columns11-13 \u2192 8s.\n\nSo the output row is:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,8,1,8,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1:\n\nInput: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOnly 1 at column2. Check if in row1, any other 1s. No. So column2:\n\nCheck vertical. Are there other 1s in column2?\n\nLooking through other rows:\n\nRow2 has a 1 at column10.\n\nRow5: no.\n\nRow8: column10 is 1.\n\nWait, let's check for column2 in all rows:\n\nRow1: column2 is 1.\n\nRow3: column2 is 0.\n\nRow others: let me check.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column2 is 0.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0] \u2192 column2 is 0.\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column2 is 0.\n\nRow5: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column2 is 0.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column2 is 0.\n\nRow7: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column2 is 0.\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column2 is 0.\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column2 is 0.\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column2 is 0.\n\nRow11: all zeros \u2192 column2 is 0.\n\nRow12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column2 is 0.\n\nRow13: all zeros.\n\nRow14: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column2 is 0.\n\nRow15: all zeros.\n\nRow16: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column2 is 0.\n\nRow17: all zeros except column1.\n\nRow18: [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column2 is 0.\n\nSo, column2 has a 1 only in row1. So no other 1s vertically. Thus, in row1's column2, the 1 remains, and all other cells in column2 are 0 (except row1's). So row1's output is the same as input: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, in row1, the 1 is in column2. Are there any other 1s in column2? No. So the vertical check for any cell in column2 except row1 would be 0. So row1's cell remains 1, others in column2 remain 0.\n\nBut what about other cells in row1. For example, in row1, are there any cells that are between two 1s in their columns? Let's take cell row1, column0. Input is 0. Are there 1s above and below in column0? Let's check column0:\n\nRow0: 0.\n\nRow1:0.\n\nRow2:0.\n\nRow3:0.\n\nRow4:0.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:0.\n\nRow7:0.\n\nRow8:0.\n\nRow9:0.\n\nRow10:0.\n\nRow11:0.\n\nRow12:0.\n\nRow13:0.\n\nRow14:0.\n\nRow15:0.\n\nRow16:0.\n\nRow17:0.\n\nRow18:0.\n\nSo column0 has no 1s. So row1's column0 remains 0.\n\nSimilarly, all other cells in row1 are 0 except column2. So row1's output is the same as input.\n\nRow2:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOnly 1 at column10. Check if there are other 1s in row2. No. Check column10: other 1s are in row0, row8, row2. So row0: column10 has 1, row2: column10 has 1, row8: column10 has 1.\n\nSo in column10, rows0,2,8 have 1s. So cells between row0 and row2 (rows1) and between row2 and row8 (rows3-7) would be 8s.\n\nBut in row2's column10 is 1. The other cells in row2 are 0. For example, cell row2, column5: is there a horizontal pair in row2? No. So it remains 0. But in column10, cells in rows1 and 3-7 would be 8s.\n\nBut row2's other cells are not between any vertical pairs. So row2's output is same as input except for column10 which is 1.\n\nBut wait, in row2's input, the cell at column10 is 1, so output is 1.\n\nSo row2's output remains same as input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nWait, but row2's column10 has 1. So in column10, the cells between row0 and row2 (row1) and between row2 and row8 (rows3-7) would be 8s. But in row2's column10, it's a 1, so no change.\n\nRow3:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nOnly 1 at column19. Check row3 for other 1s. No. Check column19. Are there other 1s?\n\nLooking at column19:\n\nRow3:1.\n\nRow18: [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column19 is 0.\n\nOther rows: probably no. So column19 has only one 1. So no vertical pairs. So row3's output is same as input.\n\nRow4:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOnly 1 at column9. Check column9 for other 1s. Let's see:\n\nRow4's column9 is 1.\n\nRow12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column9 is 1.\n\nSo column9 has 1s in row4 and row12. So cells between them (rows5-11) would be 8s.\n\nBut row4's cell is 1. So in row4's output, the 1 remains. Other cells in row4 are 0. Check if any of them are between two 1s in their row or column.\n\nFor example, cell row4, column5: 0. Are there 1s left and right in row4? No. Check column5: are there 1s above and below? Let's check column5:\n\nRow4:0.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:0.\n\nRow7:0.\n\nRow8:0.\n\nRow9:0.\n\nRow10:0.\n\nRow11:0.\n\nRow12:0.\n\nRow13:0.\n\nRow14:0.\n\nRow15:0.\n\nRow16:0.\n\nRow17:0.\n\nRow18:0.\n\nSo column5 has no 1s. So row4's cell column5 remains 0.\n\nBut column9: between row4 and row12's 1s. So rows5-11 in column9 would be 8s. So row4's column9 is 1, others in column9 between 4 and12 are 8s.\n\nBut in row4, all other cells are 0, except column9. So row4's output is same as input.\n\nRow5:\n\nInput: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOnly 1 at column1. Check column1:\n\nOther 1s in column1 are in row7, row16, row18 (row7: [0,1,0...], row16: [0,1,0...], row18: [0,1,0,1,...].\n\nSo column1 has 1s in rows5,7,16,18.\n\nSo between row5 and7: row6 \u2192 8.\n\nBetween row7 and16: rows8-15 \u2192 8.\n\nBetween row16 and18: rows17 \u2192 8.\n\nBut in row5's column1 is 1. The rest of row5's cells are 0. For example, row5, column0:0. Check if there's a pair in row5: no. Check column0: no 1s. So remains 0.\n\nSo row5's output remains same as input: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow6:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOnly 1 at column6. Check column6 for other 1s:\n\nRow14: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,...].\n\nSo column6 has 1s in row6 and row14. So cells between them (rows7-13) in column6 would be 8s.\n\nIn row6's output: the 1 remains. Other cells in row6 are 0. For example, cell row6, column7:0. Check row6 for other 1s: no. Check column7: in row0's column7 is 1. Are there other 1s in column7? No. So column7 has only row0's 1, so no vertical pairs. So cell row6, column7 remains 0.\n\nBut in column6, cells between row6 and row14 (rows7-13) are 8s.\n\nBut in row6's own cells, only column6 is 1. So row6's output is same as input.\n\nRow7:\n\nInput: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOnly 1 at column1. Check column1: other 1s in rows5,16,18. So between row5 and7: row6 (already processed). Between 7 and16: rows8-15. So those would be 8s. But row7's column1 is 1. The rest of row7's cells are 0. Are any of them between two 1s in row or column?\n\nFor example, row7, column2:0. Check row7 for other 1s: no. Check column2: only row1's 1. So no. So row7's output remains same as input.\n\nRow8:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOnly 1 at column10. Column10 has 1s in rows0,2,8. So between rows0 and2: row1 (already 0). Between rows2 and8: rows3-7. So those are 8s. Row8's column10 is 1. The rest of row8's cells are 0. So row8's output is same as input.\n\nRow9:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOnly 1 at column11. Check column11 for other 1s. Let's see:\n\nRow9: column11 is 1.\n\nAny others? No. So row9's output is same as input.\n\nRow10:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOnly 1 at column13. Check column13 for other 1s. Looking through rows:\n\nRow10: column13 is1.\n\nOther rows? Row14: column13 is0. Row others: no. So column13 has only row10's 1. So row10's output is same as input.\n\nRow11:\n\nAll zeros. So all cells remain 0 unless between two 1s in row or column.\n\nCheck each cell in row11.\n\nFor example, column14: in column14, row0 and row14 have 1s. So row11, column14 is between them (rows0 and14) \u2192 becomes 8.\n\nSimilarly, other cells in row11:\n\nFor each column j in row11:\n\nCheck if there are 1s left and right in row11 (no, since row11 is all zeros).\n\nCheck column j for any 1s above and below.\n\nFor example, column0: no 1s.\n\nColumn7: only row0 has 1. So no.\n\nColumn10: 1s in rows0,2,8. So row11's column10 is between row8 and... no, row8 is below row11? Wait, row indices start at 0, so row11 is after row8. So row11's column10 is below row8's 1. Are there any 1s below row11 in column10? No. So no vertical pairs.\n\nColumn14: row0 and row14 have 1s. So row11 is between row0 and14. So column14 in row11 becomes 8.\n\nOther columns:\n\nColumn13: only row10's 1. So no.\n\nColumn19: row3's 1. So no.\n\nSo row11's output would be all 0s except column14, which is 8.\n\nSo row11's output: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow12:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOnly 1 at column9. Column9 has 1s in row4 and row12. So between them, rows5-11 are 8s. row12's cell is 1. The rest are 0. Are any of those 0s between 1s in their column or row? For example, row12, column9 is 1. Other cells in row12 are 0. Check if any are between 1s.\n\nFor example, row12, column0:0. Check column0: no 1s.\n\nColumn9: between row4 and12, cells in rows5-11 are 8s. But row12's column9 is 1.\n\nSo row12's output is same as input.\n\nRow13:\n\nAll zeros. Check for any vertical pairs. For example, column14 has 1s in row0 and14. row13 is between them. So column14 in row13 becomes 8. Others: check.\n\nSo row13's output would be all 0s except column14 \u2192 8.\n\nSo row13's output: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow14:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow14 has 1s at column6 and14. So between them, columns7-13 \u2192 8s.\n\nAlso, in column6, there's a 1 in row6 and row14. So between them, rows7-13 \u2192 8s.\n\nSo row14's output:\n\nColumns6:1, columns7-13:8s, column14:1.\n\nSo the row becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow15:\n\nAll zeros. Check for any vertical pairs. For example, column14 has 1s in row0 and14. row15 is below row14 \u2192 no, since row15 is after row14. So no. So row15 remains all zeros.\n\nRow16:\n\nInput: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOnly 1 at column1. Column1 has 1s in rows5,7,16,18. So between row16 and18: row17 \u21928. But row16's column1 is 1. Rest of row16's cells are 0. So row16's output is same as input.\n\nRow17:\n\nAll zeros. Check column1: row16 and18 have 1s. row17 is between them. So column1 in row17 becomes 8. Other columns: check.\n\nFor example, column3: row18 has a 1 in column3. Any other 1s in column3? Let's see:\n\nRow18: column3 is 1. Are there other 1s? No. So no vertical pairs. So row17's column1 is 8, others remain 0.\n\nSo row17's output: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow18:\n\nInput: [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nTwo 1s in columns1 and3. So between them, columns2 \u2192 8.\n\nAlso, check column1: 1s in rows5,7,16,18. So cells between row16 and18: row17 is 8. But row18's column1 is 1.\n\nSo row18's output:\n\nColumns1 and3 are 1. Column2 is between them \u2192 8. So row becomes:\n\n[0,1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nPutting all this together, the test input's output is as follows:\n\nThe final answer would be a list of lists where each 0 is replaced with 8 if it's between two 1s in its row or column. The 1s remain unchanged.\n\nThe first row's output, for example, becomes:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAnd row14's output:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRows like row11 and row13, which are all zeros except for column14, have 8 in column14.\n\nRow17's output is [0,8,0,0,...] because it's between two 1s in column1 (rows16 and18).\n\nRow18's output has an 8 in column2 between the 1s in columns1 and3.\n\nSo, the final answer is structured accordingly.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices in the training examples, then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples to figure out what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has several 1s in different positions. The output replaces some 0s with 8s. Let me look at where those 8s are. For instance, in the first row of the output, the input has a 1 at position 3 (0-indexed), and the output has 1 there, but the next rows have 8s around that area. Maybe the 8s are connecting the 1s in some way. Like, perhaps they form bridges between the 1s. \n\nLooking at the first example, the input has two 1s in the first row (position 3) and the second row (position 8). The output shows 8s forming a vertical line between them. Wait, maybe the 8s are filling the cells between the 1s in the same column or row. Let me check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 1s in the first row at positions 4 and 9. The output's first row has 1 followed by 8s until the next 1. Oh, right, so maybe the 8s are filling the horizontal gaps between 1s in the same row. But wait, in Example 0, the input's first row has only one 1. So perhaps it's vertical. Hmm, maybe the 8s are between 1s in the same column. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, looking at column 3 (since the first row's 1 is at index 3), there are 1s in row 0 and row 9. The output has 8s in rows 1-8 in column 3. So that's a vertical line of 8s between the two 1s in column 3. Similarly, in Example 1's first row, the 1s are at columns 4 and 9. The output shows 8s between them horizontally. Wait, in the first row of Example 1's output, the 1 is at position 4, followed by 8s until position 9 (the next 1). So that's a horizontal line. So perhaps the pattern is that between any two 1s in the same row or column, all the 0s in between are replaced with 8s, but only if they are directly in between. \n\nBut how about other examples. Let's check Example 3. The input has a row [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output for this row is [0, 1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So between the two 1s in the same row, the 0s are replaced with 8s. That's horizontal. Then in column 4 of Example 3's input, there's a 1 in row 0 (position 4) and another in row 2 (position 4). The output has 8 in the rows between them. For example, row 1 in column 4 has 8. So vertical connections.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: For any two 1s that are in the same row or column, all the cells between them (but not including other 1s?) are replaced with 8s. However, in Example 0, the input's fifth row is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0], and the output has 8s between the two 1s in that row. So in the output row 4, we have [0,1,8,8,8,8,8,1,0], which connects the two 1s with 8s horizontally. Similarly, the columns with two 1s have 8s between them vertically.\n\nBut wait, in the fifth row of Example 0's input, the two 1s are at positions 1 and 7. The output fills the 8s in between. So yes, the 8s connect adjacent 1s in the same row or column. But what about if there are multiple 1s in a row or column? Like if there are three 1s in a row, would the 8s be between each consecutive pair? Let's check Example 2's input. Let's look at row 5: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. The output for row 5 is [0,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,0]. So between the 1s at position 1 and 9, all the 0s are replaced by 8s. Also, there's an 8 after the second 1, but maybe that's part of another connection. Wait, maybe there's a 1 in another row that's connected vertically. Hmm.\n\nWait, the output of Example 2's row 5 has 8s spanning from the first 1 at position 1 to the next 1 at position 9, and then there's another 8 at position 10. Maybe that 8 is part of a vertical connection. Let me check column 10 in Example 2. The input has a 1 in row 0 (position 6) and row 6 (position 6) maybe? Wait, the input is a bit complicated, but maybe the output's 8s are both horizontal and vertical connections.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each cell in the matrix, if it's a 0 and lies on a straight line (horizontal or vertical) between two 1s, then it's replaced with an 8. So, for example, between two 1s in the same row, all the 0s in between are turned to 8s. Similarly for columns.\n\nBut how to determine which 1s to connect. Maybe all pairs of 1s that are in the same row or column, and all the cells between them are turned into 8s, but overlapping connections would just be 8s. So even if a cell is between multiple pairs, it's still 8.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n1. For each row, find all the 1s. For each consecutive pair of 1s in the row, replace the 0s between them with 8s.\n2. For each column, find all the 1s. For each consecutive pair of 1s in the column, replace the 0s between them with 8s.\n3. The original 1s remain 1s, and other 0s remain 0s.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0, the input's first column (column 3) has 1s in rows 0 and 9. So the 8s are in rows 1-8 in column 3. Similarly, in row 4 of Example 0's input, there are two 1s at positions 1 and 7, so the 8s are between them.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the 8s are only between the 1s. So even if there's another 1 in the same row but not consecutive, that's not considered. Wait, no. For example, if a row has three 1s, then the first and second are connected, and the second and third are connected. So all the 0s between the first and third would be filled, but if the first and third are not consecutive, but the 1s are spaced, then the 0s between each consecutive pair are filled.\n\nWait, but consecutive in terms of their positions. So in a row like [1,0,0,1,0,1], the 1s are at positions 0,3,5. So between 0 and 3, fill 8s; between 3 and 5, fill 8s. So the output would be [1,8,8,1,8,1].\n\nBut in the examples, let's check. For example, in Example 3's input row 5 is [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. The output is [8, 0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0]. Wait, maybe there's a vertical connection here. Let me check the columns. For instance, the 1 in row 5, column 2 (0-based) might have a vertical connection. Let me check the column 2 in Example 3's input. The input has a 1 in row 5 (column 2) and another in row 2 (column 4? No, row 2's input is [0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0], so column 4 and 6 have 1s. Maybe the 8s in row 5's output are part of horizontal connections. The input row 5 has 1 at position 2 and 7. So in the output row 5, the 8s are between them. So from position 2 to 7, 0s become 8s. The output for row 5 is [8,0,1,8,8,8,8,1,0]. Wait, but the first element is 8. That doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe there's a vertical connection here. Let me check column 0. The input has a 1 in row 3 (column 0). The output's row 4,5,6 in column 0 are 8. So maybe in column 0, the 1 in row 3 and the 1 in row 7 (input row 7 is [1,0,...]) are connected. So rows 3,4,5,6,7 would have 8s in column 0. So in row 5, column 0 becomes 8. Which explains why in row 5's output, the first element is 8. So that's a vertical connection. So in that case, the 8s are a result of both horizontal and vertical connections. So each cell is checked for both horizontal and vertical directions. If a cell is between two 1s in either direction, it's replaced by 8.\n\nSo the transformation is: for every cell that is a 0 in the input, if it lies between any two 1s along the same row or column, replace it with 8. The original 1s remain 1s.\n\nSo the steps to apply would be:\n\n1. For each cell (i,j) in the input matrix:\n   a. If the cell is 1, leave it as 1.\n   b. Else, check if there's any pair of 1s in the same row i such that j is between their columns. Or any pair of 1s in the same column j such that i is between their rows. If yes, replace with 8. Otherwise, 0.\n\nBut how to efficiently determine this for each cell?\n\nFor the given problem, perhaps the approach is:\n\nFor each row, process each row to find the 1s and mark the 0s between them as 8s. Similarly, for each column, process each column to find the 1s and mark the 0s between them as 8s. Then combine the results, with any cell that is marked as 8 in either row or column processing becomes 8.\n\nWait, but if we do it separately for rows and columns, we need to apply both transformations. So the overall rule is: a 0 becomes an 8 if it's between two 1s in the same row or in the same column.\n\nSo the way to generate the output is:\n\n1. For each row, find all the 1s. For each pair of consecutive 1s, fill the cells between them with 8s (if they are 0s in the input).\n\n2. For each column, find all the 1s. For each pair of consecutive 1s, fill the cells between them with 8s (if they are 0s in the input).\n\n3. The original 1s are kept, and any 0 that is covered in either step becomes 8. If a cell is 0 but not between any two 1s in the same row or column, it remains 0.\n\nBut how to implement this? Let's think of it as two passes: first process all rows, then process all columns, and in each pass, mark the cells that need to be 8. But since the original 1s are preserved, any cell that is 0 in the input and is in between two 1s in the same row or column in the input becomes 8.\n\nYes. Because the 8s are only dependent on the original 1s. So the transformation doesn't consider other 8s when processing. It's only based on the original 1s.\n\nSo for the test input, we need to:\n\n- For each row, look for all 1s. For each pair of 1s in the row, fill the 0s between them with 8s.\n\n- For each column, look for all 1s. For each pair of 1s in the column, fill the 0s between them with 8s.\n\nThen combine these two results. The order might not matter because overlapping regions would still be 8s.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the examples.\n\nTake Example 0:\n\nInput row 0: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]. Only one 1. So no horizontal 8s in this row.\n\nBut column 3 (the fourth column, since indexing starts at 0) has 1s in row 0 and row 9. So between those two rows in column 3, all the 0s are replaced by 8s. So rows 1-8, column 3 are 8s.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 in the input has two 1s at columns 1 and 7. So between those columns in row 4, the 0s become 8s. Hence the output row 4 is [0,1,8,8,8,8,8,1,0].\n\nIn Example 1's first row, input is [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0]. The 1s are at columns 4 and 9. So between them, in the same row, the 0s become 8s. So the output's first row is [0,0,0,0,1,8,8,8,8,1,0]. That matches.\n\nSo the logic holds.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nThe test input is a 19-row matrix with varying lengths. Let's process each row and column.\n\nFirst, process the rows:\n\nFor each row, find the positions of 1s. Then for each consecutive pair, fill the 0s between them with 8s.\n\nThen process each column, find the positions of 1s. For each consecutive pair, fill the 0s between them with 8s.\n\nLet's start with the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nIn this row, the 1s are at positions 7, 10, and 14.\n\nSo between 7 and 10: columns 7 to 10. So columns 8,9 (0-based) are 0s and should become 8s. Then between 10 and 14: columns 10 to 14. So columns 11,12,13 are 0s and become 8s. So after processing the row, the row becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,8,1,8,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, the original row has 1 at 7, 10, 14. So between 7 and 10: indexes 7 (1), then 8,9,10 (but 10 is 1). So columns 8 and 9 are filled with 8. Then between 10 and 14: columns 11,12,13,14 (14 is 1). So 11-13 are filled with 8. So the row after row processing would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,8,1,8,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut also, between 7 and 14: but since we have 1s at 7,10,14, the consecutive pairs are (7,10), (10,14). So the 8s are between 7 and 10, then between 10 and 14. So the row processing would mark those 8s.\n\nNow, column processing. For each column, check if there are 1s and fill between them.\n\nTake column 7 (since in row 0, column 7 is 1). Let's look down the column. Are there any other 1s in column 7?\n\nLooking at the test input rows:\n\nRow 0: column7 is 1.\n\nRow 1: column7 is 0.\n\nRow 2: column7 is 0.\n\nRow3: column7 is 0.\n\nRow4: column7 is 0.\n\nRow5: column7 is 0.\n\nRow6: column7 is 0.\n\nRow7: column7 is 0.\n\nRow8: column7 is 0.\n\nRow9: column7 is 0.\n\nRow10: column7 is 0.\n\nRow11: column7 is 0.\n\nRow12: column7 is 0.\n\nRow13: column7 is 0.\n\nRow14: column7 is 0 (row14's input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So column7 is 0).\n\nRow15: 0.\n\nRow16: 0.\n\nRow17: 0.\n\nRow18: column7 is 0.\n\nSo column7 has only one 1 (row0). So no vertical 8s here.\n\nNow column10:\n\nLooking for 1s in column10.\n\nRow0: column10 is 1.\n\nRow2: column10 is 1 (row2's input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]).\n\nRow8: column10 is 1 (row8's input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]).\n\nSo in column10, the 1s are at rows 0,2,8.\n\nSo consecutive pairs: 0 and 2, 2 and 8. So between rows 0-2: rows1. Between rows2-8: rows3-7. So in column10:\n\nRow1 is 0: becomes 8.\n\nRow3-7: between 2 and8, so rows3-7 (indices 3,4,5,6,7) in column10 are 0s and become 8s.\n\nRow8 is 1.\n\nSo column10 after processing would have 1s at 0,2,8, and 8s in rows1,3-7.\n\nBut the original column10 has 1s in rows 0,2,8. So in the vertical processing, between 0 and2: rows1. Between 2 and8: rows3-7.\n\nSo any 0s in those rows would become 8s.\n\nSimilarly for other columns.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Let's try to outline the steps for the test input.\n\nProcessing rows:\n\nFor each row:\n\nFind all the positions where 1s are present. Then, for each consecutive pair (sorted by column index), mark the 0s between them as 8s.\n\nProcessing columns:\n\nFor each column:\n\nFind all the positions (rows) where 1s are present. Then, for each consecutive pair (sorted by row index), mark the 0s between them as 8s.\n\nThen, for each cell, if it was a 0 in the input and marked as 8 in either row or column processing, it becomes 8. The original 1s remain.\n\nNow, let's try to apply this to the test input.\n\nFirst, process all rows.\n\nLet's look at each row of the test input and process the horizontal connections.\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n1s at columns 7,10,14.\n\nConsecutive pairs: 7-10, 10-14.\n\nBetween 7 and10: columns8,9,10 (but 10 is 1, so columns8-9 are 0s \u2192 8s.\n\nBetween10 and14: columns11,12,13,14 (14 is 1, so 11-13 \u2192 8s.\n\nSo after row processing, row0 becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,8,1,8,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOnly one 1 at column2. No other 1s. So no horizontal 8s.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOnly one 1 at column10. No horizontal 8s.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\n1 at column19. Only one 1. No horizontal 8s.\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n1 at column9. Only one. No horizontal 8s.\n\nRow5: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n1 at column1. Only one.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n1 at column6. Only one.\n\nRow7: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n1 at column1. Only one.\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n1 at column10. Only one.\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n1 at column11. Only one.\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n1 at column13. Only one.\n\nRow11: All zeros. No changes.\n\nRow12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n1 at column9. Only one.\n\nRow13: All zeros. No changes.\n\nRow14: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n1s at column6 and14. So between column6 and14:\n\nColumns7-13. These are zeros in the input. So they become 8s.\n\nSo after row processing, row14 becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow15: All zeros.\n\nRow16: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n1 at column1.\n\nRow17: All zeros.\n\nRow18: [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n1s at columns1 and3. Between them, column2 is 0. So becomes 8.\n\nSo after row processing, row18 becomes:\n\n[0,1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nNow, process the columns for vertical 8s.\n\nFor each column, find the positions of 1s and fill between consecutive pairs.\n\nLet's go through each column:\n\nColumn0: All zeros. No changes.\n\nColumn1: Check rows where 1s are present.\n\nRow5: column1 is 1.\n\nRow7: column1 is 1.\n\nRow16: column1 is 1.\n\nRow18: column1 is 1.\n\nSo the 1s are at rows5,7,16,18.\n\nConsecutive pairs: (5,7), (7,16), (16,18).\n\nBetween 5 and7: row6.\n\nBetween7 and16: rows8-15.\n\nBetween16 and18: row17.\n\nSo in column1:\n\nRow6 becomes 8.\n\nRows8-15 (all zeros) become 8s.\n\nRow17 becomes 8.\n\nSo after processing column1, these rows in column1 become 8s.\n\nBut original 1s are at rows5,7,16,18. So:\n\nRow5: remains 1.\n\nRow6: 8.\n\nRow7: remains 1.\n\nRows8-15: 8s.\n\nRow16: remains 1.\n\nRow17: 8.\n\nRow18: remains 1.\n\nOther rows in column1: remain 0 or as processed.\n\nBut during row processing, some of these rows might have already been 0. So during column processing, we need to mark these 0s as 8s.\n\nSo after column processing, in column1:\n\nRows5:1\n\nRow6:8\n\nRow7:1\n\nRows8-15:8\n\nRow16:1\n\nRow17:8\n\nRow18:1\n\nOther rows remain 0.\n\nSo for example, row6, column1: was 0 in input. Now becomes 8.\n\nSimilarly, row17, column1: was 0, becomes 8.\n\nNow, column2:\n\nRow1: 1.\n\nNo other 1s. So no vertical 8s.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow18 has a 1. No others. So no changes.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow6: 1.\n\nRow14: 1.\n\nSo between rows6 and14: rows7-13.\n\nIn column6, rows7-13 are 0s. So during column processing, these rows become 8s.\n\nSo column6 after processing:\n\nRow6:1\n\nRows7-13:8\n\nRow14:1\n\nSo row7's column6 is 8, row8's column6 is 8, etc.\n\nRow9's column6 was 0, becomes 8.\n\nRow10's column6 was 0, becomes 8.\n\nEtc.\n\nColumn9:\n\nRow4:1.\n\nRow12:1.\n\nSo between rows4 and12: rows5-11.\n\nIn column9, these rows are 0s (except row9, column9 is 0 in input).\n\nSo rows5-11 in column9 become 8s.\n\nSo after column processing:\n\nRow4:1.\n\nRows5-11:8.\n\nRow12:1.\n\nRow9, column9: becomes 8.\n\nColumn10:\n\nRow0:1.\n\nRow2:1.\n\nRow8:1.\n\nConsecutive pairs: (0,2), (2,8), (8, ... no others).\n\nBetween 0 and2: row1.\n\nBetween2 and8: rows3-7.\n\nSo column10:\n\nRow1 becomes 8.\n\nRows3-7 become 8s.\n\nSo row1, column10: 0 \u21928.\n\nRow3, column10: 0\u21928.\n\nRow4, column10:0\u21928.\n\nRow5, column10:0\u21928.\n\nRow6, column10:0\u21928.\n\nRow7, column10:0\u21928.\n\nRow8: remains1.\n\nColumn13:\n\nRow10:1.\n\nNo other 1s. So no vertical 8s.\n\nColumn14:\n\nRow0:1.\n\nRow14:1.\n\nConsecutive pair: rows0 and14. Between them, rows1-13.\n\nSo column14:\n\nRows1-13 become 8s.\n\nColumn19 (index19):\n\nRow3:1.\n\nNo others. So no vertical 8s.\n\nColumn11:\n\nRow9:1.\n\nNo others. So no changes.\n\nOther columns: like column4,5, etc., don't have any 1s.\n\nSo after processing columns, the vertical 8s are added.\n\nNow, combining the row and column processing.\n\nEach cell that was 0 in the input and is marked as 8 in either row or column processing becomes 8. The original 1s remain.\n\nLet's take row0. After row processing, it has 8s in columns8,9,11-13. Column processing for column0's row0 is 0. Column7,10,14 are 1s. Column10's row0 is 1. So no impact from column processing on row0.\n\nRow1: after row processing, no changes. Column1's row1 is 0. Column2's row1 is1. Column10's row1 is 8 (from column processing). So row1's column10 becomes 8.\n\nRow2: after row processing, no changes. Column10's row2 is1. So no changes.\n\nRow3: after row processing, no changes. Column10's row3 is 8 (from column processing). Column19's row3 is1. So row3's column10 becomes8.\n\nRow4: after row processing, column9 is1. Column processing for column9's row4 is1. Column10's row4 becomes8 (from column processing). Also, column9's row4 is1. So row4's column10 becomes8.\n\nRow5: after row processing, column1 is1. Column processing for column1's row5 is1. Column9's row5 becomes8 (from column9's processing between rows4 and12). So row5's column9 becomes8.\n\nRow6: after row processing, column6 is1. Column processing for column6's row6 is1. Other columns: column1's row6 becomes8 (from column1 processing). Column6's rows7-13 are8. But row6's column1 is now8.\n\nRow7: after row processing, column1 is1. Column processing for column1's row7 is1. Column6's row7 becomes8 (from column6 processing).\n\nRow8: after row processing, column10 is1. Column processing for column10's row8 is1. Other columns: column10's rows3-7 are8. But row8 is processed as 1.\n\nRow9: after row processing, column11 is1. Column processing for column9's row9 is8 (from column9 processing). Also, column6's row9 is8 (from column6 processing between rows6 and14).\n\nRow10: after row processing, column13 is1. Column processing for column6's row10 is8 (from column6 processing), column10's row10: during column processing, column10's row10 is not in any pair (row10 is after row8 in column10). But column10's 1s are rows0,2,8. So row10 is beyond row8. So column processing for column10: no effect on row10. So row10's column13 is1, others are0 except column6 becomes8.\n\nRow11: after row processing, all zeros. Column processing for column6's row11 is8 (from column6 processing), column9's row11 is8 (from column9 processing). So row11's columns6 and9 become8.\n\nRow12: after row processing, column9 is1. Column processing for column9's row12 is1. Column9's rows5-11 are8. So row12's column9 remains1.\n\nRow13: after row processing, all zeros. Column processing for column6's row13 is8 (from column6 processing between rows6 and14), column9's row13 is8 (from column9 processing between rows4 and12), column14's row13 is8 (from column14 processing between rows0 and14). So row13's columns6,9,14 become8.\n\nRow14: after row processing, columns7-13 are8. Column processing for column6's row14 is1, column14's row14 is1. Column6's row14 is1, column14's row14 is1. Other columns: column14's rows1-13 are8, but row14's column14 is1.\n\nRow15: all zeros. No processing.\n\nRow16: after row processing, column1 is1. Column processing for column1's row16 is1. Column processing for column1's row17 becomes8.\n\nRow17: all zeros. Column processing for column1's row17 is8.\n\nRow18: after row processing, columns1,3 are1, column2 is8. Column processing for column1's row18 is1. No other vertical processing here.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the final output matrix is the combination of row and column processing.\n\nThis is quite involved. Let's try to write the final answer by combining all these changes.\n\nBut given the complexity, it's easy to make a mistake. Let's focus on the test input and apply the pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input's first row, after processing:\n\nRow0's columns7,10,14 are1. Between them, columns8-9 and11-13 become8. So the output row0 should be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,8,1,8,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut also, column14's processing affects rows1-13. For row0, column14 is1, so no change.\n\nRow1: originally has 1 at column2. Column10's row1 becomes8 (from column processing between 0 and2). So row1's output is:\n\n[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut also, column1's processing for row1 is0 (since column1's 1s are in rows5,7,16,18. Row1 is not between any pairs, so no change. So the row1's output is [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow2: after processing, column10 is1, and in column processing, no changes except for column10's row2 is1. So row2 remains:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: column10's processing makes row3's column10 8. Also, column19 is1. So row3's output is:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow4: column9 is1 (from input). Column10's processing makes row4's column10 8. So row4 becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: column1 is1. Column9's processing makes row5's column9 8. So row5's output is:\n\n[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: column6 is1. Column1's processing makes row6's column1 8 (from column1's processing, row6 is between 5 and7). So row6 becomes:\n\n[0,8,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: column1 is1. Column6's processing makes row7's column6 8 (since row7 is between row6 and14 in column6). So row7's output is:\n\n[0,1,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: column10 is1. Column6's processing makes row8's column6 8 (from column6's processing between rows6 and14). So row8's output is:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: column11 is1. Column9's processing makes row9's column9 8 (between rows4 and12). Column6's processing makes row9's column6 8 (between rows6 and14). So row9's output:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow10: column13 is1. Column6's processing makes row10's column6 8. Column14's processing makes row10's column14 0 (since column14's 1s are row0 and14, so row10 is between them, so column14's row10 is 8. Wait, row10's column14 is 0 in the input. But column14's 1s are at row0 and14. So between them, rows1-13 are 8. So row10's column14 becomes8. So row10's output:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow11: all zeros, but column6's processing makes row11's column6 8, column9's processing makes row11's column9 8, and column14's processing makes row11's column14 8. So row11's output:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow12: column9 is1. Column processing for column9's rows5-11 are8, but row12's column9 is1. So row12's output:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow13: column6's processing makes it8, column9's processing makes it8, column14's processing makes it8. So row13's output:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow14: after row processing, columns6,7-13,14 are1,8s,1. Column6's row14 is1. Column14's row14 is1. So row14's output is:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow15: all zeros. No changes.\n\nRow16: column1 is1. Column processing for column1's rows16-18: row17 becomes8. So row16's output:\n\n[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow17: column1's processing makes it8. So row17's output:\n\n[0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow18: after row processing, columns1,3 are1, column2 is8. Column1's row18 is1. So row18's output is:\n\n[0,1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nPutting all these rows together, the final output would be as follows. However, given the complexity, there might be some errors in the manual processing. But based on the pattern observed in the training examples, the answer should follow this structure, with 8s connecting 1s in the same row or column.",
