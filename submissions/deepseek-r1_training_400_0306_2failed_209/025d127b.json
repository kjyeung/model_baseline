        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Looking at the training examples, the input and output matrices seem to represent some kind of transformation. Let's start by examining Example 0. \n\nIn the input, there's a group of 6s forming a shape and then some 2s. The output shifts those groups. For the 6s: the second row in the input is [0,6,6,6,0,...], which becomes [0,0,6,6,6,0,...] in the output. So it looks like the entire block of 6s is shifted to the right by one position. Similarly, the 2s in the input are in rows starting with [0,0,2,2,2...], which in the output become [0,0,0,2,2,2...], again shifted right by one. \n\nSame with Example 1. The input's 8s start at column 1, but the output shifts them to start at column 2. For instance, the second input row is [0,8,8,8,8,8,0...], and the output row is [0,0,8,8,8,8,8...]. The shift seems consistent here as well. \n\nSo the pattern might be that each non-zero block is shifted one column to the right. But wait, looking closer: the 8s in the third row of input Example 1 are [0,8,0,0,0,0,8...], which becomes [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8...]. So each element in the row is shifted right by one, but perhaps only the non-zero elements? Or maybe the entire row is shifted, but preserving the structure.\n\nWait, maybe it's that each row is shifted right by one, but the leading zeros are added and the trailing zeros are removed to maintain the same row length. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's first non-zero row of input (row 1) is [0,6,6,6,0...]. The output shifts this to [0,0,6,6,6,0...]. So inserting a zero at the start and dropping the last element. Wait, but the row length remains the same. So shifting right would require that each element moves one position to the right, discarding the last element and adding a zero at the beginning. But in the examples, the row length stays the same, so maybe each row is shifted right by one, with a zero added at the start and the last element removed. That way, the row length remains the same.\n\nLet me check the third row of Example 0's input: [0,6,0,0,6,0...]. Output is [0,0,6,0,0,6...]. So shifting each element right by one. So the first element becomes 0, then the previous elements are shifted. But the last element (originally 6 in position 4) would move to position 5, but in the output row, the last element is 6 in position 5. So yes, the entire row is shifted right by one, with the first element becoming 0 and the last element (if any) being truncated to keep the same row length. Wait, but the input rows have the same length as the output. So perhaps each row is shifted to the right by one, and the first position becomes 0. So each element in the row moves right by one, and the first element is 0, the last element is lost. Let's confirm:\n\nTake Example 1's input row 2: [0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0]. Output row 1 becomes [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0]. So the original elements are shifted right by one, inserting a 0 at the start, and the last element (originally 0) is removed. So yes, the shift is right by one, each row. The output rows are each input row shifted right by one, with leading zero and trailing element cut off. \n\nSo the test input's rows need to be shifted right by one. Let's test this on the test input. The test input's first non-zero row is [0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0]. Shifting right by one would make it [0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0]. Then the next row is [0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]. Shifting right gives [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]. Then the third row [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0] becomes [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4]. Wait, but the original third row after shifting would be [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0] shifted to [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4], but the last element (0) is cut off. Wait, the original row has 10 elements. Shifting right by one would insert a 0 at the start, making 11 elements, then truncate to 10. So the last element (the original 0) is removed. So for the third row input [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0], shifting right by one would make the first element 0, then the rest shifted, leading to [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4], but wait, the original row ends with 0. So after shifting, the new row would start with 0, then the original elements up to position 8 (which was 4), then the next position was 0, which would be the last element. Wait, maybe the shift is that each element is moved right, the first element becomes 0, and the last element is dropped. So for a row of length N, after shifting, the new row is [0] + original_row[0:N-1]. Let me check:\n\nOriginal row in Example 0, first row input: [0,6,6,6,0,...] shifted to [0,0,6,6,6,0...]. So [0,6,6,6,0...] becomes [0,0,6,6,6...] \u2014 that's inserting a 0 at the start and cutting the last element. Wait, original row is length 9. After shift, new row is 0 followed by the first 8 elements. Let's see: original row is [0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0]. Shifting right by one would take the first element (0) and put it at the start, then shift all others. Wait, maybe it's a rotation? No, that's not the case. Alternatively, it's a right shift where each element moves right, the first position becomes 0, and the last element is removed. So for a row [a, b, c, d, e], shifted would be [0, a, b, c, d]. But the original example's first shifted row in example 0: input [0,6,6,6,0...] becomes [0,0,6,6,6...]. So original row's first element is 0, then 6,6,6, etc. After shifting, the first element is 0, then the original elements up to the 8th index. Wait, perhaps the shift is a right shift by one, with the first element being set to 0. Wait, maybe each row is shifted right by one, but the new first element is 0, and the rest are shifted. So the new row is [0] followed by the original row's elements from index 0 to len-2. So for a row of length 9, the new row would be [0] + original_row[0:8]. Let me test:\n\nOriginal example 0 input row 1 (0-indexed) is [0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0]. The output row 1 is [0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0]. So the output row is [0] followed by the first 8 elements of the input row. Yes, that works. Because input row 1 starts with 0,6,6,6,0... the output is 0 followed by the first 8 elements of the input row (excluding the last element). So the pattern is to shift each row to the right by one, adding a 0 at the beginning and dropping the last element.\n\nSo for any row in the input, the output row is [0] + row[:-1]. \n\nLet me check example 1's input row 2: [0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]. The output row would be [0] + [0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0], which becomes [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0], which matches the output. Yes, that works.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Each row in the test input should be shifted right by one, with the first element becoming 0 and the last element being dropped.\n\nLet's process the test input row by row:\n\nTest input has 10 columns. Each row in the output will be [0] + input_row[:-1].\n\nFirst row of test input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Shifting gives [0] + the first 9 elements (all 0s). So same as input.\n\nSecond row input: [0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0]. Shifted becomes [0] + [0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0]. So new row is [0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0].\n\nThird row input: [0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0] \u2192 shifted \u2192 [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0].\n\nFourth row input: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4].\n\nFifth row input: [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, wait. Let me check. The original row is [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4]. Shifted would be [0] + first 9 elements. The first 9 elements are [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]. So the new row is [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]. But the original fifth row's last element was 4. So after shifting, the 4 in position 9 is dropped. Hmm. So the output row becomes [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nWait, but the input fifth row is [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4]. So the first 9 elements are [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]. So the shifted row is [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]. But the original fifth row in the test input's output should be part of a shape. Let me check the test input's structure. The test input seems to have a structure similar to Example 1 but with 4s. The input has a diamond or arrow shape made of 4s. The output after shifting should shift that shape to the right by one. \n\nLet's see the test input's structure. The second row is a line of six 4s starting at column 1. Then each subsequent row has 4s moving to the right and down. The fifth row ends with four 4s. After shifting, the 4s should all move right by one. So the second row becomes starting at column 2. The third row's 4s would start at column 2. Wait, but according to the shift, the entire row is shifted right. So in the third row, the first 4 is at column 2 (originally column 1 in input) becomes column 2 in output. But according to the shift rule, the third row input is [0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]. Shifting gives [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]. So the 4s are at positions 2 and 7. Similarly, the fifth row input is [0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4]. Shifting gives [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4]. Wait, wait no. The fifth row of the test input is [0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4]. Shifting right would be [0] + first 9 elements: [0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4]. Wait, the original fifth row is [0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4]. The first nine elements after the shift are [0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4]. So the shifted row is [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4]. But in the test input's expected output, maybe the 4s form a similar pattern shifted right. \n\nWait, let me check the expected output for the test input. Let me reconstruct what the output should look like.\n\nOriginal test input rows (after processing):\n\nRow 0: all zeros. Shifted remains same.\n\nRow 1: [0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nThen rows 6-9 are zeros, which shift to same.\n\nPutting it all together, the output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0]\n\n[0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\n[0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\n[0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nThen the remaining rows are all zeros.\n\nWait, but in the original training examples, after shifting, the pattern might form a different shape. Let me check example 1's output. The input for example 1 had a structure where the 8s formed a diagonal pattern. After shifting right, the output maintains that structure but shifted. So applying the same logic here should work.\n\nTherefore, the correct output for the test input would be each row shifted right by one, with leading zero and last element truncated. That's the pattern observed in the training examples.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Looking at the training examples, the input and output grids seem to represent some kind of transformation. Let me start by comparing the first example.\n\nIn Example 0's input, there are two shapes made of 6s and 2s. The output for 6s seems to have shifted to the right. For instance, the first line with 6s in the input starts at position 2 (0-based index), but in the output, they start at position 3. The same goes for the 2s; they also shift right. Wait, but looking more closely, maybe it's not just a shift. Let me check the structure.\n\nThe input has a diamond-like shape for the 6s. The output's 6s are shifted right by one column. Similarly, the 2s in the input form a triangle, and in the output, they're also shifted right. But maybe there's more to it than just shifting. Let me see the rows. For example, the second row of the input for 6s is [0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0], and the output's corresponding row is [0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0]. So each non-zero element is shifted right by one. But then looking at the next rows: input's third row is [0,6,0,0,6,0,0,0,0], output's third row is [0,0,6,0,0,6,0,0,0]. So each 6 in the input moves right by one. Similarly, the 2s also shift right by one. So maybe the transformation is shifting each non-zero element to the right by one column, padding with zero on the left. But wait, the first element in the row becomes zero, and each element moves right. So that's a possible pattern.\n\nLet's check Example 1. The input has 8s forming a sort of arrow. The output's 8s are shifted right by one as well. For instance, the input's second row is [0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0], and the output's second row starts at index 2: [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0]. So again, shifting right by one. The next rows follow the same pattern. The fifth row in input is [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8], and output is [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8], but wait, here the shift would make the 8s start at position 4. Wait, input's fifth row has 8s starting at index 4 (0-based) in the input. Output's fifth row starts at index 4 as well. Hmm, maybe in some cases, when the shift would go beyond the row's length, it's truncated. Or perhaps there's a different pattern. Alternatively, maybe the shift is only applied to certain parts of the structure.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the third row is [0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]. The output's third row is [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0], so each 8 is shifted right by one. Similarly, the fourth input row is [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0], and output is [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8]. So yes, shifting right by one. The fifth input row is [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]. The output's fifth row is [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]. Wait, if shifted right by one, that would make the 8s start at index 5, but the output's fifth row starts at index 4. So maybe that row isn't shifted? That's confusing. Or perhaps the shift is only applied to the elements except the last row of the structure. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each row is shifted right by one, but the first element is dropped. Let me see. For example, in the first example's input row [0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0], shifting right by one would make the new row [0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0], which matches the output. Similarly, in the second row of input [0,6,0,0,6,0,0,0,0], shifting right gives [0,0,6,0,0,6,0,0,0], which is the output. So that seems to work.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row input: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8], shifting right by one would make [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8], but the output is [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]. Wait, that's the same as the input. Hmm, that's a problem. Unless there's an exception here. Alternatively, maybe the shifting is applied only to the parts of the structure that are not at the rightmost edge. But this seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, maybe the shift is applied to each individual element, but when shifted, if there's already a non-zero element in the new position, it's kept. Or perhaps it's a rotation or some other transformation. Alternatively, perhaps the entire structure is shifted to the right, but maintaining the shape.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input and output. The 6s form a diamond shape. In the output, the diamond is shifted to the right by one. Similarly, the 2s triangle is shifted right by one. So the entire structure is shifted right by one column, maintaining their positions relative to each other. So the pattern is shifting all non-zero elements to the right by one column, with the leftmost column becoming zeros. But how does that work with elements at the end? Like in Example 1's fifth row, shifting right by one would push the 8s to the right, but the original row was [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]. Shifting right would make [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8], but the output is the same as the input. That contradicts. Wait, no. Wait the output's fifth row is [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]. Wait, maybe in that case, shifting right would push the 8s but since the row can't extend beyond the original length (9 elements), the rightmost element is dropped. So for the input row [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8], shifting right would make [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8], but the output's fifth row is [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8], which is the same as input. That's a problem. Maybe there's another aspect here.\n\nWait, perhaps the shifting is only applied to the rows that are part of the upper structure, and the bottom part (like the fifth row in Example 1) is not shifted because it's the base. Alternatively, maybe the shift is applied to all rows except the last row of each figure. But in Example 0, the fifth row in the input is [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0], which after shifting becomes [0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0], but the output's fifth row is [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0]. Wait, no, the output's fifth row is [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0], which is same as input. Wait, but in Example 0's output, the fifth row is [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0], but according to the input, the fifth row is [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0], so in this case, the output fifth row is the same as input. But in the example given, the input's fifth row is shifted. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait Example 0's input fifth row is [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0]. The output fifth row is [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0]. So same as input. But other rows like the fourth input row [0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,0] becomes [0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,0]. So shifted right. So why is the fifth row not shifted? Because it's the bottom of the diamond. Hmm. Maybe the pattern is that each row is shifted right by one, except for the last row of each structure. Alternatively, perhaps the shift is applied to the entire structure except for the bottom row. But this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is applied to all rows, but when a row is shifted, any elements that would be shifted beyond the row's length are dropped, and zeros are added at the beginning. Wait, no. For example, the fifth row in Example 0's input is [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0]. If shifted right by one, it would become [0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0]. But the output is the same as input. So that contradicts. So this approach might not be correct.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is different. Let's think of the structures as some kind of diagonal elements. For example, in Example 0, the 6s form a diamond shape. The output's diamond is shifted right by one. But perhaps the shift is only applied to the left part of the structure. Alternatively, maybe each non-zero element is moved one cell to the right, but if that cell is non-zero, it's left as is. But that's not the case in the examples. For instance, in Example 0's input second row [0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0], the output is [0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0]. So each 6 is shifted right, and the first position becomes zero. That suggests a right shift.\n\nBut in the fifth row of Example 1's input and output, the fifth row remains the same. Maybe that's because the shift would cause the elements to wrap around, but since they're at the end, they can't shift further. Wait, but the fifth row in input is [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]. If shifted right by one, the first element would be 0, then 0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8, but the last element is dropped. So the row would become [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8], but in the output, it's [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]. So that's not matching. Hmm. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is not a shift but a mirroring. Let's check. For example, in Example 0's input second row [0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0], the output is [0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0]. That's not a mirror image. Mirror would reverse the elements. So no. Alternatively, maybe the structure is moved to the right, but the last element is preserved. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that each non-zero element is shifted right by one, but the last column is kept as is. Or maybe the entire structure is shifted to the right, and the parts that would go beyond the grid are removed, but the bottom rows are adjusted to maintain the shape.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each row is shifted right by one, but the first element is removed (shifted right and the row length remains the same). For example, a row [0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0] becomes [0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0]. So each element is shifted right, and the first element (0) is moved to the left, but that's not quite. Wait, in shifting right, each element moves to the right, and the leftmost position is filled with zero. So yes, that's a right shift by one. So for each row, all elements are shifted right by one position, and a zero is added at the start. Wait, but the row length remains the same. So the last element is dropped. For example, a row of 9 elements when shifted right would lose the last element and add a zero at the beginning. Wait, but in the examples, the output rows are the same length as input. For example, in Example 0, each row has 9 elements. So shifting right would require that each element is moved right, and the first position becomes zero. The last element would be dropped. Wait, but in the input row [0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0], shifting right would make [0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0], which matches the output. Similarly, the row [0,6,0,0,6,0,0,0,0] becomes [0,0,6,0,0,6,0,0,0]. That fits. Then, the fifth row input [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0] becomes [0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0], but the output fifth row is the same as input. That's a problem. But in Example 0's output, the fifth row is [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0]. So the input fifth row wasn't shifted. Hmm. That contradicts the pattern. So why isn't the fifth row shifted?\n\nWait, maybe the shift is applied only to certain parts of the grid. For example, in Example 0, the first structure (6s) spans rows 1 to 5. The output shifts those rows. The 2s structure is in rows 7 to 9, which are also shifted. The rows that are all zeros remain unchanged. But in the fifth row of the 6s structure, after shifting, the fifth row would be shifted. But according to the output, it's the same as input. So perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each non-zero element is shifted right by one, except for the last element in each row, which remains the same. But I need to check.\n\nLooking at Example 1's fifth input row [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]. The output fifth row is [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]. So if shifting right, the last element would be dropped, but the output remains the same. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Perhaps the pattern is to shift the entire structure to the right by one column, maintaining the structure's shape. So any part of the structure that would go beyond the grid's boundary is cut off. For example, in Example 0's 6s structure, shifting right by one makes the entire diamond shape move right, so any part that was on the right edge is now cut off. But looking at the output, the diamond in Example 0's output is indeed shifted right and some elements are missing. For example, the third row of the input's 6s is [0,6,0,0,6,0,0,0,0]. The output's third row is [0,0,6,0,0,6,0,0,0]. So the left 6 moves right, the right 6 also moves right. But then in the fifth row of the input's 6 structure, which is [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0], the output fifth row is [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0], same as input. But according to a right shift, it should become [0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0]. But the output hasn't shifted. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is applied only to the leftmost elements. For example, the leftmost part of the structure is shifted, but the rightmost part is left as is. But that's not clear.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output. The fifth row in input is [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]. Output is the same. If the shift is applied to all non-zero elements, then each 8 should move right, but in this case, the 8s are already at the end. So shifting them would push them beyond the grid, hence they are dropped, and zeros are added to the left. But the output is the same as input. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the shift is applied only to certain parts of the structure. Alternatively, maybe the entire structure is shifted, but only the upper part, and the lower part is left as is. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is a right shift by one column for all elements, but when the element is in the last column, it wraps around to the first. But that would make a circular shift, which doesn't fit the examples. For instance, in Example 0's fifth row input [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0], a circular shift would make [0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0], but the output is the same as input. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's look for another pattern. Perhaps the transformation is not a shift, but a certain kind of rotation or reflection. For example, a reflection over a vertical axis. Let's check. In Example 0's input, the first row of 6s is [0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0]. If reflected vertically, the row would become [0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0], which is not the output. The output is [0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0]. So that's not a reflection.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of shifting and filling. Let's think of each structure as being shifted right by one column, and the shifted elements are placed, but overlapping elements are overwritten. But this is getting too vague.\n\nWait, let's consider the positions of the numbers. In Example 0's input:\n\nFor the 6s:\n\nRow 1: columns 1,2,3\n\nRow 2: columns 1,4\n\nRow 3: columns 2,5\n\nRow 4: columns 3,6\n\nRow 5: columns 4,5,6\n\nIn the output:\n\nRow 1: columns 2,3,4\n\nRow 2: columns 2,5\n\nRow 3: columns 3,6\n\nRow 4: columns 4,7 (but in the output row 4, it's [0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,0], which is columns 4 and 6?)\n\nWait, maybe the output is the same as the input shifted right by one column. For each cell (i,j) in the input, the output cell (i,j+1) has the same value if j+1 is within the grid. So all non-zero elements are moved to the right by one column, and zeros are added on the left.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row with 6s is at columns 1,2,3 (row 1). Shifting right by one would place them at 2,3,4 (row 1), which matches the output.\n\nRow 2 of input: columns 1 and 4. Shifted right to columns 2 and 5, which matches output row 2.\n\nRow 3: columns 2 and 5 \u2192 columns 3 and 6. Output row 3: yes.\n\nRow 4: columns 3 and 6 \u2192 columns 4 and 7. Output row 4 is [0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,0], so columns 4 and 6. Wait, column 4 is 6, and column 6 is 6. Wait, that's inconsistent. Because shifting column 3 to 4, column 6 to 7. So why is there a 6 in column 6 in output row 4?\n\nAh, maybe the input row 4 is [0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,0]. Shifting right would give [0,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0]. But the output row 4 is [0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,0]. Hmm, that's not matching. So this approach might be incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe there's another pattern. Looking at the numbers, perhaps the transformation is shifting each non-zero element to the right by one, but when two elements are adjacent in the original, they merge or something. But that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is creating a right diagonal shift. For example, each row is shifted right by one more than the previous row. But in Example 0's input, the first row is shifted by one, the second by one, etc. No, that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nWait, let's look at the second example. Example 1's input has 8s forming a kind of diagonal structure. The output shifts each row's 8s to the right by one. For example, input row 2: [0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0] \u2192 output [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0]. Shifted right by one. Row 3 input [0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 output [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0]. Shifted right by one. Row 4 input [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0] \u2192 output [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8]. Shifted right by one. Row 5 input [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8] \u2192 output [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]. Wait, this row isn't shifted. Why? Because shifting right would push the first 8 to column 5, but in the output, it's still in column 4. So maybe the shift is applied to all rows except the last one of each figure.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 8s structure spans rows 1 to 5. The output's rows 1 to 4 are shifted, but row 5 is not. Similarly, in Example 0's 6s structure spans rows 1 to 5. The output's rows 1-4 are shifted, row 5 remains the same. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input row 5: [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0]. Output row 5: same. So maybe the pattern is to shift all rows of the structure except the last one. That would explain why in Example 1, the fifth row (last of the structure) is not shifted. Similarly, in Example 0's 6 structure, the fifth row is the last of the structure and is not shifted.\n\nIf that's the case, then the transformation is: For each contiguous block of non-zero elements (each figure), shift each row in the figure right by one column, except for the last row of the figure, which remains unchanged.\n\nBut how do we determine where a figure starts and ends? In Example 0, the 6s are from row 1 to row 5 (0-based?), then the 2s are from row 7 to row 9. So each figure is separated by rows of zeros. So the algorithm would be:\n\n1. Split the input into figures (contiguous non-zero rows, separated by zero rows).\n\n2. For each figure, process each row except the last one by shifting right by one column.\n\n3. The last row of the figure remains as is.\n\nWait, let's test this with Example 0:\n\nThe 6s figure is rows 1-5. Process rows 1-4 by shifting right, leave row 5 as is. Let's see:\n\nRow 1 (original): [0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 shifted \u2192 [0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0] (matches output row 1).\n\nRow 2 (original): [0,6,0,0,6,0,0,0,0] \u2192 shifted \u2192 [0,0,6,0,0,6,0,0,0] (output row 2).\n\nRow 3 (original): [0,0,6,0,0,6,0,0,0] \u2192 shifted \u2192 [0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,0] (output row 3).\n\nRow 4 (original): [0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,0] \u2192 shifted \u2192 [0,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0]. But the output row 4 is [0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,0]. Hmm, that's different. So this approach doesn't match here.\n\nWait, maybe the last row of the figure is not processed, but the others are shifted. For the 6s figure in Example 0:\n\nRows 1-5. Shifting rows 1-4, leave row 5. But the output row 4 is [0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,0]. The original row 4 is [0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,0]. Shifting right gives [0,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0]. But output row 4 has 6 at position 4 and 6. So perhaps this is not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire figure is shifted right by one column. For Example 0's 6s figure, shifting the entire structure right by one column. However, the last row would then shift as well. But in the output, the last row is the same as input. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's another way. Looking at the output rows for each figure:\n\nIn Example 0's 6s figure:\n\nInput rows 1-5:\n\nRow1: [0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,6,0,0,6,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,6,0,0,6,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0]\n\nOutput rows 1-5:\n\nRow1: [0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,6,0,0,6,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0]\n\nSo the first four rows are shifted right by one. The fifth remains the same.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's 8s figure:\n\nInput rows 1-5:\n\nRow1: [0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nOutput rows 1-5:\n\nRow1: [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nAgain, rows 1-4 are shifted right by one, row5 remains the same.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For each figure (contiguous non-zero rows), shift all rows except the last one of the figure to the right by one column. The last row of the figure remains unchanged.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Split the input into figures separated by zero rows.\n\n2. For each figure:\n\n   a. For each row in the figure except the last one:\n\n      i. Shift the row right by one column (adding a zero at the start, and dropping the last element).\n\n   b. Keep the last row of the figure as is.\n\n3. The zero rows between figures remain unchanged.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 row0 (zeros)\n\n[0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0] \u2192 row1 (part of a figure)\n\n[0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0] \u2192 row2 (part of figure)\n\n[0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0] \u2192 row3 (part of figure)\n\n[0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4] \u2192 row4 (part of figure)\n\n[0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4] \u2192 row5 (last row of figure)\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 zero row\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 zero row\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 zero row\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 zero row\n\nSo the figure here is rows1-5. Rows1-4 need to be shifted right by one, row5 remains the same.\n\nProcessing each row:\n\nRow1 input: [0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0] \u2192 shift right \u2192 [0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0] \u2192 but wait, shifting right by one in a row of 10 elements would add a zero at the start and drop the last element. So original row1 has 10 elements. Shifting right would take the first element (0) and move all others right, making the new row [0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0] \u2192 but the original row1 is [0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0]. Shifting right would result in:\n\nOriginal: positions 0-9:\n\n0:0, 1:4, 2:4, 3:4,4:4,5:4,6:4,7:0,8:0,9:0.\n\nShifted right: new row is [0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0]. Wait, because shifting right by one, each element moves to the next index. So the new row would be:\n\nnew[0] = 0\n\nnew[1] = original[0] =0\n\nnew[2] = original[1] =4\n\nnew[3] = original[2] =4\n\nnew[4] = original[3] =4\n\nnew[5] = original[4] =4\n\nnew[6] = original[5] =4\n\nnew[7] = original[6] =4\n\nnew[8] = original[7] =0\n\nnew[9] = original[8] =0\n\nBut original[9] is 0, so the last element (original[9]) is dropped. So after shifting, the row is [0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0]. But the output row1 should be shifted right by one. Let's check the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's input row1: [0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0] (9 elements). Shifted right becomes [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0], which is adding a zero at the start and shifting. So for the test input row1 which is 10 elements, shifting right would add a zero at the start, and drop the last element. So the row becomes [0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0]. Wait, the original row is 10 elements. Let's count:\n\nOriginal row1: 0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0 (10 elements).\n\nShifting right: each element moves to the right by one, so the new row is:\n\n0 (new first element), then original elements 0-8 shifted right:\n\n0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0. Wait, original elements 0-8 are 0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0. Shifting right would make them start at index 1: [0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0]. The original last element (0) is dropped. So yes.\n\nSo row1 becomes [0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0].\n\nRow2 input: [0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0] \u2192 shift right \u2192 [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0].\n\nRow3 input: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0] \u2192 shift right \u2192 [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4].\n\nRow4 input: [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4] \u2192 shift right \u2192 [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow5 remains the same: [0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4].\n\nSo the transformed rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nRows6-9 are zeros.\n\nSo the final output should be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut let me check the example outputs for formatting. The training examples have outputs with the same number of rows as input, each row same length. The test input has 10 rows. The output should follow the same structure.",
