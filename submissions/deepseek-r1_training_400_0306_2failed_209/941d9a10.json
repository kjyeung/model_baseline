        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input grids and output grids. Let me look at the training examples to see what's changing.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a lot of 0s and 5s arranged in some way. The output seems to replace some 0s with 1s, 2s, 3s, etc. Looking at the input rows, there are three rows starting with [0,0,5...], then a row of all 5s. Then again three similar rows, another all 5s, and then two more. In the output, the first three rows have the first two 0s turned into 1s. Then the middle three rows (rows 4-6) have the 0s starting at position 3 turned into 2s. And the last two rows have the last two 0s turned into 3s. So maybe each block of rows between the 5s lines is getting a new number, incrementing each time. Like the first block gets 1, next gets 2, then 3, etc.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has alternating rows of all 5s and rows with 0s and 5s. The output has the first three 0s in the first row turned into 1s. Then in the fifth and sixth rows, positions 4-7 are 2s. And the last entry in the last row is 3. So again, each group between the 5s lines is being replaced by an incrementing number, but the position might depend on where the 5s are. Maybe the blocks between the 5s lines are each assigned a level (1,2,3) and the 0s adjacent to the 5s in certain positions get replaced?\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the first three rows have the first two 0s (positions 0 and 1) turned into 1s. Then the next block (rows 4-6) have the 0s starting at position 3 (columns 3-6) turned into 2s. Then the last two rows (rows 8-9) have the last two positions (8 and 9) turned into 3s. So each block between the 5s lines is being processed. The first block after a 5s line gets the next number. The replaced 0s are contiguous and their position shifts with each block.\n\nIn Example 1, the first block (row 0) has the first three 0s turned into 1. Then the next block (rows 4-5) have positions 4-7 as 2s. Then the last row has the last position as 3. So the pattern might be that each segment between 5s lines gets a number starting from 1, and the 0s in that segment that are adjacent to the 5s in some way are converted into that number, possibly the leftmost group of 0s for 1, then next group to the right for 2, etc.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see where the 5s are. In the input, 5s form vertical lines. For instance, in Example 0, the third and seventh columns are 5s. So the input has vertical lines at columns 2 and 7 (0-based index), with all 5s. Then in the output, the regions between these vertical 5 lines are filled with numbers. For example, the first three rows in Example 0's output have 1s in columns 0 and 1 (left of the first vertical 5 line at column 2). Then the middle block (rows 4-6) have 2s in columns 3-6 (between columns 2 and 7). Then the last two rows have 3s in columns 8-9 (right of column 7). So the vertical 5 columns act as separators, dividing the grid into left, middle, and right regions. Each such region in the blocks between horizontal 5 lines gets filled with an incrementing number.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the input has vertical 5s in column 3 and 8 (since the rows have 5s there). The output's first block (row 0) has 1s in columns 0-2 (left of column 3). Then in rows 4-5, columns 4-7 (between 3 and 8) are 2s. And in the last row, column 9 is 3 (right of column 8). So the vertical 5s split the row into left, middle, right. Each horizontal block (between the horizontal 5 lines) has these regions filled with 1,2,3 in order. The number increases by 1 for each horizontal block. So the first horizontal block (top) uses 1, then next uses 2, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- The first three rows (block 0) after the initial horizontal 5 line (if there's one) get 1s in the left region. Then after the next horizontal 5 line (row 3), the next three rows (block 1) get 2s in the middle region. Then after another horizontal 5 line (row7), the next two rows (block2) get 3s in the right region.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1, the first block (row0) is before the first horizontal 5 line (row1). Then after that line, the next block (rows2-3?) but in Example1's output, the first change is in row0 (which is before the first horizontal 5 line). Hmm, maybe the horizontal 5 lines separate the blocks. So each block is the group of rows between two horizontal 5 lines (or top of the grid and the first horizontal 5 line, etc). Then each such block is assigned a level (1,2,3...) and within that block, the 0s in the regions (left, middle, right) defined by the vertical 5 lines are replaced by the level number.\n\nWait in Example0's input:\n\nThe horizontal 5 lines are rows 3 and 7. So the blocks are:\n\nBlock 0: rows0-2 (top to first horizontal 5 line) \u2192 level 1.\n\nBlock1: rows4-6 (rows after row3 up to row7) \u2192 level2.\n\nBlock2: rows8-9 (after row7) \u2192 level3.\n\nIn the output, each block's left/middle/right regions (based on vertical 5s) are filled with the level number. For example, in block0 (level1), the left region (columns0-1) are 1s. In block1 (level2), the middle region (columns3-6) are 2s. In block2 (level3), the right region (columns8-9) are3s.\n\nIn Example1, the input has horizontal 5 lines at rows1,3,6,8. So the blocks are:\n\nBlock0: row0 (before row1) \u2192 level1.\n\nBlock1: rows2-5 (rows after row1 up to row3) \u2192 level2? Wait, rows2-3 (row3 is a horizontal 5). Then rows4-5 are between row3 and row6. So maybe blocks are:\n\nRow0 \u2192 block0 (level1)\n\nRows2 \u2192 block1 (level2?)\n\nBut the output in Example1 shows that row0's first three 0s are 1s (level1). Then rows4-5 have 2s (level2). Row9 has a 3 (level3). So perhaps the blocks are:\n\n- Block0: rows0 \u2192 level1\n\n- Block1: rows2-5 \u2192 level2 (since between row1 and row3, then between row3 and row6)\n\nWait, maybe the horizontal 5 lines split the grid into sections. Each section (group of non-5 rows between two horizontal 5 lines) is a block. Then each block is assigned a level starting from 1. Then, within each block, the regions left/middle/right (determined by vertical 5 lines) are filled with the level number. But the regions are filled in the same way: left region first, then middle, then right. So in each block, the leftmost possible region (left of first vertical 5) is filled with the level number. If that region is already filled (like in the next block), then move to the next region.\n\nWait in Example0:\n\nBlock0 (rows0-2) \u2192 level1. Left region (columns0-1) filled with 1s.\n\nBlock1 (rows4-6) \u2192 level2. Middle region (columns3-6) filled with 2s.\n\nBlock2 (rows8-9) \u2192 level3. Right region (columns8-9) filled with3s.\n\nSo in each block, the next available region is filled. The regions are left, middle, right. So the first block fills left, next fills middle, then right.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nBlock0 (row0) \u2192 level1. Left region (columns0-2, since vertical 5 is at column3). So filled with 1s.\n\nBlock1 (rows2-5) \u2192 level2. Middle region (columns4-7, between vertical 5s at 3 and 8). So filled with 2s.\n\nBlock2 (rows7 and 9) \u2192 but in the output, row7 is part of a horizontal5 line. Then the next block would be row9, which is after row8 (horizontal5). So level3. Right region (column9) filled with3.\n\nSimilarly, in Example2:\n\nLooking at the input, the vertical 5s are at columns1,4,6,8. Wait, in Example2's input, each row (non-horizontal5) has 5s at positions1,4,6,8. So vertical 5 columns are 1,4,6,8. So the regions would be left of column1 (columns0), between 1 and4 (columns2-3), between4 and6 (columns5), between6 and8 (column7), and right of8 (columns9). But in the output, the first block (rows0-2) have 1s in column0. Then the next block (rows4-5) have 2s in column5. Then rows7-9 have3s in column9. So perhaps the regions are leftmost, then next to the right, etc. Each block fills the next region. So the first block (level1) fills leftmost possible region (column0), next (level2) fills next region (column5), which is between columns4 and6. Then level3 fills rightmost (column9). \n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n1. The grid is divided into horizontal blocks separated by horizontal lines of all 5s.\n\n2. Each such block is assigned a level number (starting from 1, incrementing by 1 for each subsequent block).\n\n3. Within each block, the 0s in a specific region (determined by the vertical 5s) are replaced by the level number. The regions are chosen in order: leftmost possible, then next to the right, etc., for each subsequent block.\n\nThe vertical regions are determined by the vertical 5s. For example, vertical 5s at columns x1, x2, x3... split the row into regions left of x1, between x1 and x2, between x2 and x3, etc., and right of the last x.\n\nThen, for each horizontal block (level n), replace the 0s in the nth region (left to right) with n. So for the first block (level1), the leftmost region. Second block (level2), the next region, etc. If there are more blocks than regions, maybe wrap around? But in the examples, the number of blocks seems to match the number of regions. For example, in Example0, three blocks and three regions (left, middle, right). Example1 has three blocks (level1,2,3) and three regions (left, middle, right). Example2 has three blocks, but the vertical 5s split into more regions, but only three regions are used (left, middle, right again? Or perhaps the regions are ordered and for each block, we pick the next region in sequence.)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regions are ordered left to right, and each block fills the next region in sequence. For example:\n\nIn Example0:\n\nVertical 5s at columns2 and7. So regions are left (0-1), middle (3-6), right (8-9). The three blocks each fill these regions in order.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nVertical 5s at 3 and8. So regions left (0-2), middle (4-7), right (9). Three blocks, each fills one region in order.\n\nIn Example2:\n\nVertical 5s at1,4,6,8. So regions would be:\n\nLeft of1: 0\n\nBetween1-4: 2-3\n\nBetween4-6:5\n\nBetween6-8:7\n\nRight of8:9\n\nBut in the output, the blocks fill regions 0 (level1), 5 (level2), 9 (level3). So perhaps the regions are ordered as left, then next possible (even if there are multiple vertical 5s), but the regions are considered leftmost to rightmost. So in Example2, the regions are left (0), then next is between1 and4 (columns2-3), then between4-6 (column5), etc. But the output shows that level2 fills column5 (region between4 and6). So maybe the regions are ordered left to right, and each block picks the next region in that order. So for Example0, three regions left, middle, right. Each block takes the next. For Example2, the first block (level1) takes left (0), the next (level2) takes next region (columns2-3?), but in the output, Example2's level2 is in column5 (which is between4 and6). Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regions are ordered from left to right, and each block fills the next available region where all the positions in that region are 0s in the original input. So in Example2's input, in the first block (rows0-2), the leftmost region (column0) is all 0s. So they are replaced by 1. The next region (columns2-3) in those rows have 0s. But maybe the next block (rows4-5) have the next region (columns5, since in those rows, the 5s are at 1,4,6,8, so between4 and6 is column5. In the input rows4-5, column5 is 0, so replaced by 2. Then the next block (rows7-9) has the rightmost region (column9) as 0s, replaced by3.\n\nSo the key steps are:\n\n1. Split the grid into horizontal blocks separated by horizontal 5 lines.\n\n2. For each block, determine its level (1, 2, 3...).\n\n3. Identify the vertical regions created by vertical 5 columns.\n\n4. For each block, in order, replace the 0s in the next available vertical region (left to right) with the level number.\n\nNow, applying this to the Test Input.\n\nFirst, let's look at the Test Input:\n\nThe input is:\n\nRow0: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\nRow2: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\nRow3: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\nRow4: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\nRow5: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\nRow6: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\nRow7: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\nRow8: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\nRow9: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nFirst, identify the horizontal 5 lines. These are rows1,4,6,8. So the horizontal blocks are:\n\n- Block0: row0 (before row1)\n- Block1: rows2-3 (after row1 up to row4)\n- Block2: row5 (after row4 up to row6)\n- Block3: row7 (after row6 up to row8)\n- Block4: row9 (after row8)\n\nBut according to the pattern, each block is assigned a level. So Block0 is level1, Block1 is level2, Block2 is level3, Block3 is level4, Block4 is level5. But the previous examples had up to level3, so maybe in this case, the regions may repeat if needed. But the vertical regions need to be determined.\n\nNow, vertical 5 columns: looking at the non-horizontal5 rows (like row0, which is [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]). So the vertical 5s are at columns1,3,6,8. So the vertical 5 columns are 1,3,6,8. So the regions are:\n\nLeft of column1 (column0)\n\nBetween1 and3 (columns2)\n\nBetween3 and6 (columns4-5)\n\nBetween6 and8 (column7)\n\nRight of8 (column9)\n\nSo regions are:\n\n0: column0\n\n1: column2\n\n2: columns4-5\n\n3: column7\n\n4: column9\n\nNow, each block (level1 to level5) will fill these regions in order. But the previous examples only had up to level3. So for the test input, perhaps:\n\nBlock0 (level1): fill region0 (column0)\n\nBlock1 (level2): fill region1 (column2)\n\nBlock2 (level3): fill region2 (columns4-5)\n\nBlock3 (level4): fill region3 (column7)\n\nBlock4 (level5): fill region4 (column9)\n\nLooking at the input rows in each block:\n\nBlock0 (row0): [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]. The 0s in column0 are 0. So replace column0 with1.\n\nBlock1 (rows2-3): [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0] and same. The region1 is column2. In these rows, column2 is0. So replace with2.\n\nBlock2 (row5): [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]. Region2 is columns4-5. In this row, columns4 and5 are0 and0. Replace with3.\n\nBlock3 (row7): [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]. Region3 is column7. In this row, column7 is0. Replace with4.\n\nBlock4 (row9): [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]. Region4 is column9. In this row, column9 is0. Replace with5.\n\nBut in the examples, the outputs didn't use numbers beyond 3. However, in Example1's last row, the output uses3. So maybe the pattern allows higher numbers if there are more blocks.\n\nBut let's check the test input's expected output based on this logic.\n\nFor each block:\n\n- Block0 (row0): column0 becomes1 \u2192 [1,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\n- Block1 (rows2-3): column2 becomes2 \u2192 rows2 and3 have [0,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\n- Block2 (row5): columns4-5 become3 \u2192 [0,5,0,5,3,3,5,0,5,0]\n\n- Block3 (row7): column7 becomes4 \u2192 [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,4,5,0]\n\n- Block4 (row9): column9 becomes5 \u2192 [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5]\n\nBut looking at the previous examples, the numbers in the output are 1,2,3. However, this test input has five blocks, which would require levels up to5. But maybe there's a different pattern here. Alternatively, maybe the levels reset after three, but that doesn't fit the prior examples. Alternatively, maybe the regions are grouped in left, middle, right, and each level cycles through them. For example, level1: left, level2: middle, level3: right, level4: left again, etc. But that complicates the pattern. Alternatively, maybe the regions are considered as left to right and each level uses the next region in sequence, even if there are more regions than levels.\n\nBut according to the prior examples, the regions are filled in order. Let's proceed.\n\nSo the expected output rows would be:\n\nRow0: [1,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow1: all 5s.\n\nRow2: [0,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow3: same as row2.\n\nRow4: all 5s.\n\nRow5: [0,5,0,5,3,3,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow6: all 5s.\n\nRow7: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,4,5,0]\n\nRow8: all5s.\n\nRow9: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5]\n\nBut looking at the previous examples, the numbers in the output don't go beyond3. For example, Example1's last entry is3, and Example2's last entries are3. So perhaps there's a pattern where the level is determined by the number of regions, but in the test input, there are 5 regions and 5 blocks, which would require levels up to5. However, perhaps the actual pattern is that each horizontal block increments the level, and the regions are filled in left to right order. So even if there are more blocks, it continues.\n\nBut maybe the vertical regions are split by the vertical 5s, and each block's level corresponds to the number of the block, and the region is the same as the block's level. For example, first block (level1) fills the first region (leftmost), second block (level2) fills second region, etc. But if there are more blocks than regions, then it wraps around. But in the test input's case, there are 5 blocks and 5 regions, so each block would fill a unique region.\n\nBut the examples show that the regions are filled in order. So I'll proceed with the initial assumption.\n\nSo the Test Input's output would have:\n\nRow0: first block (level1) \u2192 region0 (column0) \u2192 1.\n\nRows2-3: second block (level2) \u2192 region1 (column2) \u21922.\n\nRow5: third block (level3) \u2192 region2 (columns4-5) \u21923.\n\nRow7: fourth block (level4) \u2192 region3 (column7) \u21924.\n\nRow9: fifth block (level5) \u2192 region4 (column9) \u21925.\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, the outputs only used 1,2,3. However, the test input has more blocks. Maybe the pattern is that the level corresponds to the order of the blocks modulo3, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the regions are only left, middle, right, and the blocks cycle through them. For example, level1: left, level2: middle, level3: right, level4: left again, level5: middle again. But that would mean:\n\nTest input:\n\nBlock0 (level1): left (column0) \u21921.\n\nBlock1 (level2): middle (columns4-5) \u21922.\n\nBlock2 (level3): right (column9) \u21923.\n\nBlock3 (level4): left again (column0) \u21924? But in previous examples, numbers didn't go beyond3. So this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regions are split into left, middle, right, and each subsequent block cycles through these regions. But this seems inconsistent with the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical 5s define the regions, and each block's level determines which region to fill. For example, level1 fills the leftmost possible region, level2 next, etc. But in the test input, the vertical regions are left (0), then column2 (between1 and3), columns4-5 (between3 and6), column7 (between6 and8), and column9 (right of8). So five regions. Each block's level would correspond to the region index (level1 \u2192 region0, level2\u2192region1, etc.). So the first block (level1) fills region0 (column0), second block (level2) fills region1 (column2), third block (level3) fills region2 (columns4-5), fourth block (level4) fills region3 (column7), fifth block (level5) fills region4 (column9). But in the output, the numbers would be1,2,3,4,5. However, the training examples only used up to3. But perhaps the pattern allows higher numbers.\n\nBut in the Test Input's case, we need to apply this logic. Let's assume this is the correct pattern.\n\nThen, the output for the Test Input would be:\n\nRow0: [1,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow1: all5s.\n\nRows2-3: [0,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow5: [0,5,0,5,3,3,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow7: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,4,5,0]\n\nRow9: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5]\n\nBut the training examples didn't have numbers beyond3. Let me check Example2's output. In Example2's input, vertical5s are at columns1,4,6,8, creating regions 0,2-3,5,7,9. The output's first block fills column0 with1, next block fills column5 with2, next block fills column9 with3. So it's using levels1,2,3 for three blocks, each taking the next region (0, then5, then9). So in that case, the regions were left, middle (columns5?), then right. So perhaps the regions are ordered left, middle (even if there are multiple vertical 5s), and right. So the middle could be any region between the first and last vertical 5. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regions are considered as left, middle, right, regardless of how many vertical 5s there are. For example, left is everything before the first vertical5, right is everything after the last vertical5, and middle is between the first and last vertical5. But in Example0, first vertical5 is at2, last at7. Middle is 3-6. In Example1, first at3, last at8. Middle is4-7. In Example2, first at1, last at8. Middle is columns2-7. But the output for Example2's middle is column5. So maybe middle is split into multiple sub-regions, and each subsequent block fills the next sub-region.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the pattern is that for each block, the leftmost possible region (from left to right) that hasn't been filled in previous blocks is filled with the block's level number. So the first block fills the leftmost region, next fills the next leftmost, etc. So in Example0, three blocks fill left, middle, right. In Example2, three blocks fill left, middle (columns5), and right. In the test input, five blocks would fill left, column2, columns4-5, column7, and column9, using levels1-5.\n\nBut the previous examples don't have such a case. However, given that the test input requires this, and the training examples follow the pattern of left, next, etc., perhaps this is the case.\n\nSo applying that to the test input:\n\nEach block's level determines the region to fill, in left to right order.\n\nBlock0 (level1): region0 (column0).\n\nBlock1 (level2): region1 (column2).\n\nBlock2 (level3): region2 (columns4-5).\n\nBlock3 (level4): region3 (column7).\n\nBlock4 (level5): region4 (column9).\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\nRow0: [1,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow1: all5s.\n\nRow2: [0,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow3: same as row2.\n\nRow5: [0,5,0,5,3,3,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow7: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,4,5,0]\n\nRow9: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5]\n\nSo this would be the expected output.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The goal is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices in the training examples and then apply that pattern to the test input. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the training examples to identify any common patterns. Let's start with Example 0. The input is a 10x10 matrix. The output seems to have some regions changed from 0 to 1, 2, 3, etc. Let's compare the input and output rows.\n\nIn Example 0's input, rows 0-2 (0-indexed) have 5s in positions 2 and 7. The output changes the first two elements of these rows to 1s. Then, rows 4-6 have 5s in position 2 and 7 again, but in the output, positions 3-6 are changed to 2s. Similarly, rows 8-9 have the 5s in positions 2 and 7, and the output changes the last two elements to 3s. The rows with all 5s (rows 3 and 7) remain unchanged.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has 5s in certain columns. The output changes some leading 0s to 1s, then some middle 0s to 2s, and the last row has a 3 at the end. Similarly, Example 2 shows that 0s adjacent to certain 5s are replaced with incrementing numbers like 1, 2, 3 in different regions.\n\nSo the pattern seems to involve replacing certain 0s with numbers starting from 1, increasing each time a new region is encountered. The regions might be determined by their position relative to the 5s. Also, each time there's a row of all 5s, the next set of rows below might be a new region where the 0s are replaced with the next number.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 0 again. The rows with all 5s are at positions 3 and 7. The rows above row 3 (rows 0-2) have their first two 0s changed to 1s. Then rows 4-6 (below row 3) have positions 3-6 changed to 2s. Then rows 8-9 (below row 7) have the last two 0s changed to 3s. So each block of rows between the all-5 rows is a region where certain 0s are replaced with a number that increments each time. The position of the replaced 0s might depend on the columns where the 5s are in those rows.\n\nIn Example 0's input rows (non-5 rows), the 5s are in columns 2 and 7. The replaced 0s are in the first two columns (1s), then columns 3-6 (2s), then columns 8-9 (3s). So maybe the regions between the 5s are getting filled with the numbers. The 5s act as separators. So between two 5s in a row, if there are 0s, they get replaced with the current level number. The level increments each time after an all-5 row.\n\nWait, perhaps the all-5 rows are dividers, and each section between them (including top before first divider, between dividers, and bottom after last divider) is a level. Each level has a number (starting at 1, then 2, 3, etc.), and within each level's rows, the 0s adjacent to the 5s are replaced with that number. The position of the replacement depends on where the 5s are in that row.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 0, the first group (rows 0-2) have 1s in the first two columns. The 5s in these rows are at columns 2 and 7. The 0s to the left of the first 5 (columns 0-1) are replaced with 1s. Then, in the next group (rows 4-6), the 5s are again at 2 and 7. The 0s between the 5s (columns 3-6) are replaced with 2s. Then, in rows 8-9, the 0s to the right of the last 5 (columns 8-9) are replaced with 3s. So maybe each level corresponds to a direction: left of first 5, between 5s, and right of last 5. Each time an all-5 row is encountered, the next level increments, and the direction changes.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n- Split the matrix into sections divided by all-5 rows.\n- For each section, depending on its order (first, second, third), replace certain 0s adjacent to the 5s in each row with the level number (1, 2, 3, etc.).\n- The replacement areas are: left of the first 5, between the first and last 5, right of the last 5, cycling through these areas as the level increases.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The all-5 rows are at rows 1, 3, 6, 8. The output's first section (row 0) has 1s in columns 0-2 (left of the first 5 in column 3). Then next section (rows 2 and 4-5) have 2s in columns 4-7 (between the 5 in column 3 and 8). The third section (row 7) isn't changed (maybe level 3 hasn't been applied here?), but the last row (row 9) has a 3 in column 9 (right of the last 5 in column 8).\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, row 9 has [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,3]. So the 3 is in the last column, which is right of the last 5 in column 8. So the third level (after the third all-5 row) replaces the right part. So perhaps each time after an all-5 row, the next section's replacement area cycles through left, between, right, left, etc. But how many sections are there?\n\nAlternatively, the levels are counted starting from 1, and each level's replacement area is determined by (level-1) mod 3:\n\n- Level 1: replace left of first 5\n- Level 2: replace between first and last 5\n- Level 3: replace right of last 5\n- Level 4: back to left, etc.\n\nBut in Example 0, there are two all-5 rows (rows 3 and 7). So the sections are:\n\n- Before row 3 (level 1, replace left)\n- Between row 3 and 7 (level 2, replace between)\n- After row 7 (level 3, replace right)\n\nIn Example 0's output, the sections correspond to these levels. That's why the first three rows (before first all-5) have left 0s replaced with 1s, then between 3-7 replaced with 2s, and after 7, right replaced with 3s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, there are four all-5 rows (rows 1,3,6,8). So sections are:\n\n- Before row1 (level1: left)\n- Between row1-3 (level2: between)\n- Between row3-6 (level3: right)\n- Between row6-8 (level4: left again)\n- After row8 (level5: between?)\n\nBut in Example1's output, after row8 (last all-5), there's only row9. Here, the replacement is a 3 in column9 (right of the last 5 in column8). So maybe the levels are 1,2,3,4,5, but the replacement area cycles every three levels. Let's see:\n\nExample1's output:\n\nRow0: level1 (left of first 5 in column3) \u2192 1s in columns0-2.\n\nRow2 is in the next section (after row1 all-5). Then rows4-5 are in the section after row3. The replacement here is level2: between first and last 5. The 5s in these rows are at columns3 and8. So between columns3 and8, which are columns4-7. So 2s there.\n\nThen rows7 is after row6 (all-5). The section here is level3, which would be right of last 5. But in row7, the 5 is in column3 and8. So right of 8 would be column9, but row7's output is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0], which is unchanged except perhaps for other reasons. Hmm. Then row9 is after row8 (all-5). This would be level4. If the cycle is 1-2-3 and repeats, then level4 is left again. But in row9, the replacement is at column9 (right). So maybe the cycle isn't strict. Alternatively, each all-5 row increments the level and the direction cycles through left, between, right, left, etc.\n\nIn Example1, there are four all-5 rows. So the sections are:\n\n- Before row1: level1 (left)\n- Between row1 and row3: level2 (between)\n- Between row3 and row6: level3 (right)\n- Between row6 and row8: level4 (left)\n- After row8: level5 (between)\n\nBut in row9 (after row8), the replacement is in the right (column9). That doesn't fit. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternative approach: For each row that is not all 5s, look at the positions of the 5s. For each such row, the 0s in certain regions (left of first 5, between first and last 5, right of last 5) are replaced with a number corresponding to the \"level\" determined by how many all-5 rows are above it. For example, if there are two all-5 rows above the current row, the level is 3, and the replacement region is right of last 5.\n\nWait, in Example0:\n\nThe first three rows (0-2) are before any all-5 row. So level1. Then rows4-6 are after the first all-5 row (row3), so level2. Rows8-9 are after two all-5 rows (row3 and7), so level3. Then the replacement regions are left, between, right.\n\nSo the level is determined by the number of all-5 rows above the current row. For each row, count how many all-5 rows are above it (including previous rows), and that gives the level. Then, the region to replace is (level-1) mod 3. If mod 3 is 0 \u2192 left, 1 \u2192 between, 2 \u2192 right.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0-2: no all-5 rows above. So level=0. (0-1) mod 3 = 2? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the level is determined by the number of all-5 rows before the current row. So for rows above the first all-5 row, level1. Rows after first but before second all-5 row, level2. Rows after second all-5 row, level3.\n\nIn Example0, the first all-5 row is row3. Rows0-2: before any all-5 \u2192 level1. Rows4-6: between row3 and row7 (second all-5) \u2192 level2. Rows8-9: after row7 \u2192 level3. Then the regions are:\n\nLevel1: replace left of first 5.\n\nLevel2: replace between first and last 5.\n\nLevel3: replace right of last 5.\n\nThis matches the output. So for each row, based on which section it's in (level), replace the corresponding region with the level number.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Split the matrix into sections divided by all-5 rows. Each section is a group of rows between two all-5 rows (or before the first, or after the last).\n\n2. For each row in a section, determine the level: the order of the section (starting from 1). For example, first section (before first all-5) is level1, next is level2, etc.\n\n3. For each row in a section, look at the positions of 5s in that row. The first 5 and last 5 in the row determine three regions: left of first 5, between first and last, right of last 5.\n\n4. Depending on the level number, replace the 0s in one of these regions with the level number. The mapping is level1 \u2192 left, level2 \u2192 between, level3 \u2192 right, level4 \u2192 left again, etc. (cycling every three levels).\n\nSo for a given level, the region to replace is (level-1) mod 3. If mod3 is 0 \u2192 left, 1\u2192between, 2\u2192right.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nThe test input is a 10x10 matrix. Let's identify the all-5 rows. Let's check each row:\n\nRow0: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0] \u2192 not all 5s.\n\nRow1: all 5s.\n\nRow2: not all 5s.\n\nRow3: not all 5s.\n\nRow4: all 5s.\n\nRow5: not all 5s.\n\nRow6: all 5s.\n\nRow7: not all 5s.\n\nRow8: all 5s.\n\nRow9: not all 5s.\n\nSo the all-5 rows are rows1,4,6,8.\n\nNow, split into sections:\n\nSection1: rows0 (before row1).\n\nSection2: rows2-3 (between row1 and row4).\n\nSection3: row5 (between row4 and row6).\n\nSection4: row7 (between row6 and row8).\n\nSection5: row9 (after row8).\n\nNow, each section's level is determined by their order. So section1 is level1, section2 level2, section3 level3, section4 level4, section5 level5.\n\nFor each level, the region to replace is (level-1) mod3.\n\nLevel1: (1-1)=0 mod3 \u2192 0 \u2192 left.\n\nLevel2: (2-1)=1 mod3 \u21921 \u2192 between.\n\nLevel3: (3-1)=2 mod3 \u21922 \u2192 right.\n\nLevel4: (4-1)=3 mod3=0 \u2192 left.\n\nLevel5: (5-1)=4 mod3=1 \u2192 between.\n\nSo for each row in each section, replace the corresponding region with the level number.\n\nLet's process each section:\n\nSection1 (row0, level1 \u2192 replace left of first 5).\n\nRow0: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nFirst 5 is at index1. Left of that is index0. So replace index0 with 1. But in the training examples, they replace a range. For example, in Example0's first section, multiple 0s were replaced. So for left, replace all 0s before the first 5.\n\nIn row0, the first 5 is at column1. So the left region is column0. Replace 0 with 1.\n\nSo row0 becomes [1,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0].\n\nWait, but in the training examples, when replacing left, they replaced two columns (e.g., Example0's rows0-2 had first two 0s replaced with 1). Wait in Example0, the first 5 in the row is at column2. So left of column2 is columns0-1. Hence replaced with 1s. So perhaps the replacement is all 0s left of the first 5.\n\nSo for row0 in test input, first 5 is at column1. So left is column0. Replace that 0 with 1.\n\nBut in the training examples, sometimes the first 5 is at column2, and the first two 0s are replaced. So yes, left of first 5 (columns before the first 5) are replaced.\n\nSo row0's first 5 is at index1. So columns0 are left. Replace 0 \u21921. So row0 output: [1,5, ...].\n\nNow, let's check the next row in section2 (rows2-3, level2 \u2192 replace between first and last 5).\n\nRow2: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nFirst 5 is at index1. Last 5 is at index8 (since indices are 0-9). So between first and last 5 is columns2 to7. In this row, the 5s are at 1,3,6,8. So between first (1) and last (8) 5. So columns2-7. But in between, there are 5s at 3 and6. So the regions are between 1 and3 (columns2?), between 3 and6 (columns4-5), between6 and8 (column7). But according to the pattern, replace all 0s between first and last 5 with the level number (level2, which is 2).\n\nSo replace any 0s between columns1 and8 (since first 5 is at1, last at8) with 2. Wait, the 'between' region is between first and last 5. So columns after first 5 (index1+1=2) up to before last 5 (index8-1=7).\n\nSo columns2 to7. So in row2, the elements at columns2-7 are [0,5,0,0,5,0]. So the 0s here would be replaced with 2. So columns2,4,5,7:\n\nOriginal row2: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nAfter replacement between first and last 5:\n\ncolumns2-7: 0\u21922 (if 0), 5 stays. So columns2 is 0\u21922, column3 is5 (stays), column4 is0\u21922, column5 is0\u21922, column6 is5 (stays), column7 is0\u21922.\n\nSo row2 becomes [0,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,0].\n\nBut wait, the level is 2, so replaced with 2s. But the original 5s remain. So the output for row2 would be [0,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,0].\n\nBut according to the training examples, when replacing between, sometimes the 0s between first and last 5 are replaced. For example, in Example0, the between replacement (level2) replaced columns3-6 with 2s, as those were between the first 5 (col2) and last 5 (col7) in that row.\n\nWait, but in Example0's input rows (like row4), the first 5 is at col2, last at col7. So between is cols3-6. So replaced. Similarly, in row2 of test input, first5 is at1, last at8. So between cols2-7. So the 0s there are replaced with 2.\n\nSo row2 becomes:\n\nOriginal: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nAfter replacement between first and last 5 (cols2-7):\n\ncol2:0\u21922\n\ncol3:5\u21925\n\ncol4:0\u21922\n\ncol5:0\u21922\n\ncol6:5\u21925\n\ncol7:0\u21922\n\nSo the row becomes: [0,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,0]\n\nBut in the training examples, when replacing between, the 5s are kept and 0s are replaced. So this seems correct.\n\nRow3 in section2 is [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0], same as row2. So after replacement between first and last5 (cols2-7):\n\nSame as row2: [0,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,0].\n\nNow section3 (row5, level3 \u2192 replace right of last5).\n\nRow5: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nFirst5 is at1, last5 is at8. So right of last5 is column9. But in the row, column9 is 0. So replace column9 with3.\n\nSo row5 becomes: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,3].\n\nBut wait, the original row5 is part of section3 (between row4 and6), which is level3. So right of last5 (col8) is col9. So replace 0\u21923.\n\nThus, row5's output is [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,3].\n\nSection4 (row7, level4 \u2192 (4-1)=3 mod3=0 \u2192 left).\n\nSo replace left of first5 in row7.\n\nRow7: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nFirst5 is at1. Left of that is column0. Replace 0\u21924.\n\nSo row7 becomes [4,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0].\n\nBut level4's replacement is left, which would be column0 here.\n\nBut in the training examples, when level is 4, but mod3 gives 0 (left), but in Example1, after multiple all-5 rows, the replacements might continue. For example, in Example1's row9, which is level5 (after four all-5 rows), which mod3 gives (5-1)=4 mod3=1 \u2192 between. But in Example1's row9, the replacement is right (3), which doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps this indicates that the mod3 approach isn't correct, or maybe I'm miscalculating the levels.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the level is determined by the number of all-5 rows before the current section, and the regions cycle through left, between, right for each subsequent section.\n\nSo for each section, the region to replace is based on the section number modulo3. Section1: left, section2: between, section3: right, section4: left, section5: between, etc.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nSection1 (row0): level1 \u2192 left.\n\nSection2 (rows2-3): level2 \u2192 between.\n\nSection3 (row5): level3 \u2192 right.\n\nSection4 (row7): level4 \u2192 left.\n\nSection5 (row9): level5 \u2192 between.\n\nSo processing each section accordingly.\n\nSection4 (row7, level4 \u2192 left):\n\nRow7's first5 is at1. Left is column0. Replace 0\u21924.\n\nSo row7 becomes [4,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0].\n\nSection5 (row9, level5 \u2192 between).\n\nRow9: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nFirst5 is at1, last5 at8. Between is columns2-7.\n\nReplace 0s between cols1 and8 (cols2-7) with5? Wait level5 is between, so replace with5?\n\nWait no, the replacement number is the level number. Level5 would use the number5. But in the training examples, the highest number seen is3 (Example0's output has 3). So perhaps the level number is used modulo3? But in Example0, level3 uses3. So if the level is higher than3, then the number is the level itself, but perhaps the regions cycle every three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement number is the level number, not modulo3. But in Example0, level3 is3, Example1's row9 is level3, but in Example1's output, row9 has 3 in the last column. So perhaps the number is the level number, but regions cycle every three. So for level4, the region is left, and number is4. But in the training examples, there are no examples with numbers beyond3. However, in the test input, the sections could have higher levels.\n\nBut in the test input's section5 (level5), the replacement is between. So the replacement number would be5. But the training examples don't show numbers beyond3. However, the problem states to follow the pattern. So perhaps the numbers continue incrementing beyond3.\n\nBut let's proceed as per the pattern.\n\nRow9 in section5 (level5 \u2192 between).\n\nSo between first5 (col1) and last5 (col8) \u2192 cols2-7. Replace 0s in this range with5.\n\nOriginal row9: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\ncols2-7: [0,5,0,0,5,0]\n\nSo replace 0s with5:\n\ncols2:0\u21925\n\ncol3 is5 (stays)\n\ncols4-5:0\u21925,0\u21925\n\ncol6:5 (stays)\n\ncol7:0\u21925\n\nSo the row becomes:\n\n[0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0].\n\nWait, but in the training examples, when replacing between, they replace only certain 0s. For example, in Example0's rows4-6, between the 5s, the 0s are replaced with2. So the numbers are the level number, not the actual value. So in the test input's section5, level5, between region, the 0s would be replaced with5.\n\nSo the row9 would become [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0].\n\nBut this seems plausible.\n\nPutting it all together, the test input's output would be:\n\nRow0 (section1, level1, left): [1,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow1 (all5): same.\n\nRow2 (section2, level2, between): [0,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,0]\n\nRow3 (section2, level2, between): same as row2.\n\nRow4 (all5): same.\n\nRow5 (section3, level3, right): [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,3]\n\nRow6 (all5): same.\n\nRow7 (section4, level4, left): [4,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow8 (all5): same.\n\nRow9 (section5, level5, between): [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, in Example0, the replacements were done for multiple rows in a section. For example, rows0-2 in section1 all had the left replaced with1. Similarly, rows4-6 had between replaced with2. So in the test input, section2 (rows2-3) are both processed with between (level2), so both rows2 and3 would have the between replacements.\n\nBut when I look at the training examples, like Example1, in the section after row3 (all5), rows4-5 are in the next section (level2), and their between regions are replaced with2. So yes.\n\nBut when applying this to the test input, the output rows would have numbers like 1,2,3,4,5. But the training examples only go up to3. However, according to the pattern, higher levels would have higher numbers.\n\nBut looking at the test input's rows:\n\nRow7 (section4, level4, left) would have column0 replaced with4. So row7 becomes [4,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0].\n\nRow9 (section5, level5, between) would have cols2-7 replaced with5, leading to [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0].\n\nBut the problem states to respond in the format of the training examples. The training examples use numbers starting from1 and incrementing by1 for each section. So perhaps even if levels go higher, the pattern continues.\n\nBut let's check if this matches the training examples.\n\nIn Example0, level1\u21921, level2\u21922, level3\u21923.\n\nIn Example1, the sections have levels1\u21921, 2\u21922, 3\u21923, 4\u21924, 5\u21925, but in the output, the last replacement is3. Wait, in Example1's row9 (output), the last element is3. That would correspond to level3 (right). How does that fit?\n\nExample1's input has four all-5 rows (rows1,3,6,8). The sections are:\n\n- Before row1 (row0) \u2192 level1 (left). Output: 1s in columns0-2.\n\n- Between row1 and3 (rows2,4-5) \u2192 level2 (between). Rows2 remains as input (but in the output, rows4-5 have 2s in columns4-7).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the sections. Let's re-express Example1's input:\n\nRows:\n\n0: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\n1: all5\n\n2: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\n3: all5\n\n4: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\n5: same as4.\n\n6: all5\n\n7: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\n8: all5\n\n9: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nSo sections are:\n\n- Section1: row0 \u2192 level1 (left).\n\n- Section2: rows2 \u2192 level2 (between).\n\n- Section3: rows4-5 \u2192 level3 (right).\n\nWait, but after row3 (all5), the next all5 is row6. So rows4-5 are between row3 and6 \u2192 level2?\n\nHmm, perhaps the section counting is based on the number of all-5 rows before the current row. For each row, count how many all-5 rows are before it (including previous rows), and that's the level.\n\nIn Example1's row0: 0 all-5 rows before \u2192 level1.\n\nRow2: 1 all-5 row (row1) \u2192 level2.\n\nRow4: 2 all-5 rows (row1,3) \u2192 level3.\n\nRow5: same as row4 \u2192 level3.\n\nRow7: 3 all-5 rows (1,3,6) \u2192 level4.\n\nRow9:4 all-5 rows (1,3,6,8) \u2192 level5.\n\nThen the replacement regions are (level-1) mod3.\n\nRow0: level1 \u2192 0 mod3 \u2192 left.\n\nRow2: level2 \u21921 mod3 \u2192 between.\n\nRow4: level3 \u21922 mod3 \u2192 right.\n\nRow5: level3 \u21922 mod3 \u2192 right.\n\nRow7: level4 \u21923 mod3=0 \u2192 left.\n\nRow9: level5 \u21924 mod3=1 \u2192 between.\n\nIn Example1's output:\n\nRow0: replaced left of first5 (column3) \u2192 columns0-2 replaced with1.\n\nRow2: no replacement (output is same as input). Because level2 is between. Row2's first5 is at3, last5 at8. So between is columns4-7. But in row2's output, those are still0. Hmm, that contradicts. Unless there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, in Example1's output:\n\nRow2's output is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0]. But according to the pattern, level2 would be between, so columns4-7 should be replaced with2. But in Example1's output, rows4-5 (level3) have columns4-7 replaced with2. So perhaps there's a mistake in the way sections are counted.\n\nAlternatively, the level is determined by the number of all-5 rows before the current row, and for each row, the replacement is based on that level.\n\nIn Example1's row2: before row2, there's one all-5 row (row1). So level2.\n\nRegion: between first and last5.\n\nRow2's first5 is at3, last5 at8. So between columns4-7. Replace with2.\n\nBut in the output, row2's columns4-7 are 0s. So this doesn't match. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the replacement is done only for the first occurrence of each section. For example, the first section (before any all-5) is level1. Each subsequent all-5 row increments the level, and the replacement region cycles through left, between, right.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Maybe the pattern is that each all-5 row increments the level, and the replacement region cycles left\u2192between\u2192right\u2192left etc.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nAll-5 rows at rows3 and7. So after row3, level increments to2. After row7, level increments to3.\n\nThus, before row3: level1 (left), between row3 and7: level2 (between), after row7: level3 (right).\n\nThis aligns with the example's output.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nAll-5 rows at rows1,3,6,8.\n\nSo levels increment each time an all-5 row is encountered. The levels are:\n\n- Before row1: level1 (left).\n\n- Between row1 and3: level2 (between).\n\n- Between row3 and6: level3 (right).\n\n- Between row6 and8: level4 (left).\n\n- After row8: level5 (between).\n\nThen the replacement regions are:\n\nLevel1 \u2192 left.\n\nLevel2 \u2192 between.\n\nLevel3 \u2192 right.\n\nLevel4 \u2192 left.\n\nLevel5 \u2192 between.\n\nIn Example1's output:\n\nRow0 (level1): left (columns0-2) \u21921.\n\nRow2 (level2): between columns4-7 (first5 at3, last5 at8) \u2192 replaced with2. But in the output, row2 is unchanged. This is a contradiction. So this suggests my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to the first occurrence of each region type after an all-5 row. For example, after each all-5 row, the next non-all-5 rows are modified according to the next region in the cycle.\n\nExample0 has two all-5 rows. After the first (row3), the next rows (4-6) are between. After the second (row7), the next rows (8-9) are right.\n\nExample1 has four all-5 rows. After each all-5 row, the next non-all-5 rows are modified in the next region:\n\n- After row1 (all-5), next rows0's next is row2. But row2 is after row1. So perhaps after row1, the next section is row2, which would be level2 (between). But in Example1's output, row2 isn't modified. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to look at the position of the 5s in each row and replace certain areas based on the order of the all-5 rows. For example, after each all-5 row, the next non-all-5 rows have their 0s replaced in a specific region, incrementing each time.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input:\n\nThe all-5 rows are at rows1,4,6,8.\n\nEach all-5 row triggers the next region to replace. So after row1 (first all-5), replace left in the next rows. After row4 (second all-5), replace between. After row6 (third all-5), replace right. After row8 (fourth all-5), replace left again.\n\nSo the replacement regions after each all-5 row cycle left \u2192 between \u2192 right \u2192 left.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nAfter row1 (first all-5): next section (rows2-3) \u2192 left.\n\nAfter row4 (second all-5): next section (rows5) \u2192 between.\n\nAfter row6 (third all-5): next section (row7) \u2192 right.\n\nAfter row8 (fourth all-5): next section (row9) \u2192 left.\n\nBut this doesn't align with the training examples. Let's check Example0.\n\nExample0 has all-5 rows at3 and7.\n\nAfter row3: next section is rows4-6 \u2192 between.\n\nAfter row7: next section is rows8-9 \u2192 right.\n\nSo the pattern after each all-5 row is to cycle through between, right, left, etc.\n\nBut how? It seems that the first all-5 row leads to between, second leads to right, etc. But this doesn't form a clear cycle.\n\nAlternatively, the first all-5 row is level1, next is level2, etc. The replacement region is determined by the level number modulo3.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's think differently.\n\nIn all training examples, the output replaces certain 0s with numbers starting from1, increasing with each section divided by all-5 rows. The replaced regions are:\n\n- First section (before any all-5): replace left of first5 with1.\n\n- Second section (after first all-5): replace between first and last5 with2.\n\n- Third section (after second all-5): replace right of last5 with3.\n\n- Fourth section (after third all-5): replace left of first5 with4, etc.\n\nSo in the test input:\n\nSections are:\n\n1. Before row1: row0 \u2192 left \u21921.\n\n2. Between row1 and4: rows2-3 \u2192 between \u21922.\n\n3. Between row4 and6: row5 \u2192 right \u21923.\n\n4. Between row6 and8: row7 \u2192 left \u21924.\n\n5. After row8: row9 \u2192 between \u21925.\n\nSo for each section, the replacement is as follows:\n\nRow0 (section1): left of first5 (col1) \u2192 column0 \u21921.\n\nRows2-3 (section2): between first5 (col1) and last5 (col8) \u2192 cols2-7 \u2192 replace 0s with2.\n\nRow5 (section3): right of last5 (col8) \u2192 col9 \u21923.\n\nRow7 (section4): left of first5 (col1) \u2192 col0 \u21924.\n\nRow9 (section5): between first5 (col1) and last5 (col8) \u2192 cols2-7 \u2192 replace 0s with5.\n\nApplying this:\n\nRow0: [1,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow1: all5s unchanged.\n\nRow2: [0,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,0]\n\nRow3: same as row2.\n\nRow4: all5s.\n\nRow5: [0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,3]\n\nRow6: all5s.\n\nRow7: [4,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow8: all5s.\n\nRow9: [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the numbers used are1,2,3, but the test input would have4 and5. However, the problem says to follow the pattern, even if new numbers appear. So the answer should reflect this.\n\nBut let's check the training examples again. For instance, Example1's output has row9 with a3. Let's see:\n\nExample1's test input has row9 in section5 (after four all-5 rows), so level5 \u2192 between, replaced with5. But in the example's output, it's replaced with3. So perhaps the level is determined by the number of all-5 rows before the current section, and the number cycles after 3.\n\nAh! Maybe the level number is (number of all-5 rows before section) mod3 +1. For example:\n\nIn Example0:\n\nSections:\n\n1. 0 all-5 before \u2192 (0 mod3) +1 =1 \u2192 number1.\n\n2. 1 all-5 before \u2192 (1 mod3)+1=2 \u2192 number2.\n\n3. 2 all-5 before \u2192 (2 mod3)+1=3 \u2192 number3.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nSection1: 0 all-5 before \u21921.\n\nSection2:1 all-5 before \u21922.\n\nSection3:2 all-5 before \u21923.\n\nSection4:3 all-5 before \u2192 (3 mod3)+1=1 \u2192 number1.\n\nSection5:4 all-5 before \u2192 (4 mod3)+1=2 \u2192 number2.\n\nBut in Example1's output, row9 (section5) has3. Hmm, this doesn't fit. So perhaps the level number is the number of all-5 rows before the section, and the replacement number is (level number modulo3)+1.\n\nBut this is getting too convoluted. \n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is the section number (starting from1) modulo3. If it's0, use3.\n\nBut this also may not fit.\n\nGiven time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial pattern where each section's replacement number increments by1, regardless of modulo. Thus, the test input's sections are numbered1-5, with numbers1-5, and replacement regions as left, between, right, left, between.\n\nThus, the final output for the test input would be:\n\n[1,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n[0,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,0]\n[0,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,0]\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n[0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,3]\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n[4,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n[0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nBut wait, row9's between replacement with5 would replace columns2-7 with5. But in the training examples, the replacement numbers don't exceed3. However, the problem allows for any numbers as per the pattern.\n\nBut according to the training examples, the numbers increment with each section. So if the test input has five sections, the numbers would go up to5. However, looking at Example1's output, the last row has3, which is after four all-5 rows. So perhaps the replacement number is the section number modulo3, with1,2,3,1,2, etc.\n\nSo for section1:1, section2:2, section3:3, section4:1, section5:2.\n\nThen:\n\nSection1 (row0): replace left with1.\n\nSection2 (rows2-3): between with2.\n\nSection3 (row5): right with3.\n\nSection4 (row7): left with1.\n\nSection5 (row9): between with2.\n\nThis would align with Example1's output, where section5 (row9) has a3. No, Example1's row9 is in section5, but replacement is3. So perhaps the replacement number is the section number modulo3, but adding1.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time, I'll proceed with the initial answer based on the pattern observed in the training examples, assuming that each section's replacement number increments sequentially, even if it exceeds3.",
