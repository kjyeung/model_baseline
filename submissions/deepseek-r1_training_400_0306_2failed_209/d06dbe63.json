        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples, then apply that to the test input. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the training examples to spot any patterns. Let's start with Example 0. The input has a single 8 in the middle of the fourth row. The output is a series of 5s arranged in a kind of diamond or maybe a star shape around the 8. The 8 itself remains in the same position. \n\nLooking at the output for Example 0, the 5s are placed in such a way that they form lines radiating out from the 8. Like, there's a vertical line above and below, horizontal lines to the sides, and diagonal lines. Wait, maybe it's a star with eight points? Or perhaps four directions? Let me check the positions.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the rows with 5s are arranged in a pattern. For instance, the first output row has a 5 at position 6 (counting from 0?), but maybe it's better to visualize. The 8 is at position (3,4) assuming rows start at 0. The 5s are in rows above and below, forming a cross and diagonals. Maybe it's like a star with points in all eight directions, but each point has a certain length. Or perhaps it's a certain number of steps away from the 8.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the 5s form a sort of diamond pattern. Let me count the distance from the 8. The first 5s are two rows above and below, but maybe it's a certain radius. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input 8 is in row 7, column 6 (if rows are 0-based). The output shows 5s spreading out from that position in a similar pattern but adjusted for the new location. The 5s form lines in different directions. For example, in the output of Example 1, the 5s are placed in the upper right and lower left directions from the 8. \n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that for each 8 in the input, the output adds 5s in all eight directions (up, down, left, right, and four diagonals) extending three steps away from the 8. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 8 is at row 3, column 4. Let's look at the 5s around it:\n\n- The row above the 8 (row 2) has 5s at column 4 (directly above?), but in the output, row 1 (second row of output) has 5,5,5 starting at column 4. Wait, maybe it's forming a cross with arms of length 2. Or maybe each direction has a certain number of 5s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s form a pattern where each direction from the 8 has three 5s, but arranged in a specific way. For example, in Example 0's output, the first line of the output has a 5 in the middle of the row (index 6?), but the 8 is at column 4. Hmm, that's two positions to the right. Maybe the 5s are placed in a spiral or specific pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s form a diamond shape with the 8 at the center. Let's check the positions. In Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0 (first row of output) has a 5 at position 6. But the 8 is at column 4. That's two positions to the right. Then row 1 has 5s at 4,5,6. Row 2 has a 5 at 4. Then the 8 is at row 3. Then row 4 has a 5 at 4 again. Row 5 has 5s at 2,3,4. Row 6 has 5 at 2. Then rows 7 and 8 have 5s at the start. Wait, this seems like a diamond shape but rotated or scaled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the 8 is the center, and 5s are placed in all directions, but each direction has a certain number of steps. For instance, up, down, left, right each have two 5s, and diagonals have two as well. But in Example 0's output, the vertical line above the 8 has a 5 in row 1 (two steps up) and row 0 has a single 5, but that's three steps up. Hmm, maybe the distance varies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a mirror image or rotation of the input's 8 position. Wait, in Example 0, the 8 is in the middle of the grid. The output has 5s forming a kind of star around it. In Example 1, the 8 is in the lower middle (row 7, column 6), and the 5s spread out in a similar star pattern but adjusted for that position.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that the 5s form a cross in all eight directions, each direction having 3 steps. For example, from the 8, each direction (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) has 5s placed three steps away, but arranged in a way that forms lines. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0, the 8 is at (3,4). Let's look at the output rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2013 the 5 is at position 6. The 8 is at position 4. So 6-4=2 steps to the right. That's two steps right. \n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2013 positions 4,5,6. So centered around the 5s here. Maybe this is the right direction, with three 5s. But how does that relate to the 8's position?\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that from the 8, you create a star pattern where each arm has a certain number of 5s. For example, each of the eight directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) has a line of 5s extending out a certain distance. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the 8 is at (3,4). Let's check the positions of the 5s:\n\nLooking at the output:\n\n- Row 0, position 6: that's (0,6). The distance from (3,4) is 3 rows up and 2 columns right. Maybe that's part of the NE direction.\n\n- Row 1, positions 4,5,6: that's (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). Hmm, perhaps this is the right direction, but why three 5s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each direction has three 5s. For example, in the right direction, three 5s to the right of the 8. But in the input, the 8 is at (3,4). So to the right would be columns 5,6,7. But in the output, in row 3 (the same row as 8), there's no 5s. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are arranged in a diamond shape, but rotated 45 degrees, creating a star with points. Let me count the positions.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\nLooking at the positions of the 5s, they form a pattern where each point of the star is a certain distance. For example, the top point is at (0,6), the right point at (1,6), the bottom at (4,4), left at (5,2), etc. Maybe each arm of the star has three 5s, but arranged in a specific way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the 5s are placed in a 3x3 cross around the 8, but expanded. But the first example's output has more than that.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that the 8 is the center, and the 5s form a plus sign (+) and a multiplication sign (\u00d7) around it, each extending a certain distance. For example, the plus sign (vertical and horizontal lines) and the diagonals, each with three 5s. \n\nIn Example 0, the 8 is at (3,4). The vertical line would be rows 1,2,3,4,5 (but in the output, row 1 has 5s in columns 4,5,6, which might not align). Hmm, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the 5s form a pattern where each arm of the star is three 5s long. For example, up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals, each with three 5s starting from the 8. But in Example 0, the 8 is in the middle. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the output for Example 0:\n\n- North: From (3,4), moving up three steps would be rows 2,1,0. But in row 0, column 6 has a 5, which is two steps right. That's not directly north. Maybe it's a diagonal direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each arm of the star is three 5s, but arranged in a way that each arm is three 5s long. For example, the arm going northeast from the 8 would have three 5s: moving one step up and right each time. So starting at (3,4), then (2,5), (1,6), (0,7). But in the output, the first row (0) has a 5 at column 6, which is two steps right. So maybe each arm has two steps. \n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the 5s in the first row are at position 6. So from the 8's position (4th column), moving two steps to the right and three steps up (since the 8 is in row 3). So (3-3=0, 4+2=6). So that's three steps up and two steps right. Maybe each arm is three steps in a certain direction, combining vertical and horizontal. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the 5s are placed in all cells that are a certain Manhattan distance from the 8. For example, Manhattan distance 3. Let's compute that for Example 0.\n\nThe Manhattan distance from (3,4) to (0,6) is |3-0| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5. That's not 3. Hmm. Maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: look for the number of 5s added. In Example 0's output, there are multiple 5s arranged in lines. For example, the first three rows have 5s forming a kind of arrow pointing to the right. Then the lower part has arrows pointing left. Similarly, in Example 1, the 5s are arranged around the 8 in a symmetrical way but shifted based on the 8's position.\n\nWait, perhaps the 5s form a pattern that's a combination of arrows pointing in all eight directions from the 8, each arrow being three 5s long. For example, each direction (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) has three 5s starting at the 8 and extending outward. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the 8 is at (3,4). Let's take the northeast direction: moving up and right. So starting from (3,4), the next cell would be (2,5), then (1,6), then (0,7). But in the output, the first row (0) has a 5 at column 6. So (0,6) is two steps right and three steps up. That doesn't fit a straight line. Maybe the arrows are three cells long but at certain angles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each arrow is three cells in a line, but each direction is offset. For example, the north arrow has three cells above the 8, but in the output, the 8 is in row 3, so north would be rows 2,1,0. But in row 2, there's a 5 at column 4 (directly above), row 1 has 5s starting at column 4, and row 0 has a single 5 at column 6. That doesn't form a straight line. So perhaps that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that the 5s form a shape similar to a knight's move in chess. For example, from the 8, each 5 is two steps in one direction and one in another. But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a diamond shape where each layer is added. For example, the 8 is the center, and layers of 5s are added around it. In Example 0, the output has 5s forming a diamond of radius 3. Let me check the positions. The 8 is at (3,4). The 5s are in positions that are up to 3 steps away in some combination. For instance, (0,6) is 3 rows up and 2 columns right. (1,4) is 2 rows up and 0 columns. So maybe the diamond shape with Manhattan distance 3. The Manhattan distance from (3,4) to (0,6) is 3 + 2 =5, which is more than 3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are placed in a pattern that reflects the 8's position. For example, mirroring the 8's column and row in some way. In Example 0, the 8 is at column 4 (middle of 13 columns, 0-12). The output's 5s are spread symmetrically around column 4. Similarly, in Example 1, the 8 is at column 6, and the 5s are spread around that.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input: the 8 is in row 7, column 6. The output has 5s extending to the right and left, up and down, but adjusted for that position. For instance, the top-right corner of the output has a 5 at the end of the first row (position 12), which would be far right. So perhaps the 5s are arranged in a way that mirrors the 8's position relative to the grid's center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a rotated version of the input, but that doesn't fit because the input is all zeros except the 8.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions of the 5s relative to the 8 in both examples.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\n- The 8 is at (3,4).\n- The 5s form a pattern where there are three 5s in a vertical line above and below, three in a horizontal line to the left and right, and three in each diagonal direction. But the actual positions don't form straight lines. Maybe each direction has a certain structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s form a \"flower\" pattern with petals in each direction. Each petal is a line of three 5s. For example, in the north direction, three 5s going up, each step moving one cell up. Similarly for other directions. But checking Example 0's output:\n\nNorth of the 8 (row 3, column4):\n\nRow 2 has a 5 at column4 (one up).\nRow 1 has 5s at columns4,5,6 (which doesn't form a straight line up).\nRow 0 has a 5 at column6 (three up from row3, but shifted right).\n\nThis doesn't fit a straight line. So maybe the petals are not straight lines but have a different shape.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the 5s form a kind of spiral around the 8. But the examples don't show a spiral, but rather a symmetrical pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\nThe 8 is at row7, column6. The output has 5s in a symmetrical pattern around it, with some extending to the right and up, others to the left and down. For example, the top-right of the output has a 5 at position12 (last column), which is column6 plus 6 steps. But the 5s in that area are in a diagonal line from the 8.\n\nWait, perhaps each direction from the 8 has three 5s, but each step in that direction is two cells. For example, in the NE direction (up and right), each step moves two cells up and one to the right. Or some other combination.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 5s as being placed in a cross that's rotated 45 degrees. So instead of a plus sign, it's a multiplication sign. Each arm of the cross has three 5s. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 5s in row0, column6 would be part of the NE arm. Then row1 has 5s at 4,5,6 which might be part of the E and NE arms. But it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the 5s are placed in all cells that are a certain Chebyshev distance (chessboard distance) from the 8. For example, all cells within distance 3. Chebyshev distance is max(|x1-x2|, |y1-y2|). So for a distance of 3, any cell where the row or column difference is up to 3. But in Example0, the 8 is at (3,4), so cells from row0 to row6 and column1 to column7 would be included. But the output doesn't fill all those cells. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: the output for each example seems to have the 5s arranged in a pattern that is symmetrical in some way, possibly reflecting the position of the 8. For instance, in Example0, the 8 is near the top, so the 5s spread below. In Example1, the 8 is lower, so the 5s spread above and to the sides.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output, the 5s are arranged in a pattern that seems to have three 5s in certain directions. For example, the top part has a single 5, then three 5s below that, then a single 5 again. Similarly, the bottom part has a similar pattern. Maybe each direction has a sequence of 1,3,5, etc., but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s could be forming a fractal-like pattern, but the examples are too small to see that.\n\nPerhaps the key is to notice that the 5s form a specific geometric shape around the 8, and the shape depends on the 8's position. For instance, when the 8 is in the upper part of the grid, the 5s spread downward, and vice versa. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the 5s are placed in a certain pattern relative to the 8's column and row. For example, mirror the column and row indices. But in Example0, the 8 is at row3, column4. The 5s are spread to the right and left columns. For instance, in row1, columns4,5,6 have 5s. Maybe the number of 5s increases as you move away from the 8's row or column.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a transformation where the 5s are placed in all cells that are in the same row, column, or diagonal as the 8, but only a certain number of steps away. For example, three steps in each direction. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0, the 8 is at (3,4). So:\n\n- Same row: columns1 to7 (steps 3 left and 3 right).\nBut in the output, the same row (row3) has only the 8. So that's not it.\n\n- Same column: rows0 to6 (steps 3 up and down). In the output, there's a 5 in row2, column4, row4, column4. So that's two steps up and down.\n\n- Diagonals: For example, from (3,4), moving up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right.\n\nIn row0, column6: that's 3 up and 2 right (not a perfect diagonal). So maybe diagonals of varying lengths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the 5s are placed in all cells that form a certain shape, like a hexagon or another polygon around the 8.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach: compare the input and output positions of the 5s relative to the 8 in both examples.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput 8 at (3,4).\n\nOutput 5s are at:\n\n(0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (9,0).\n\nExample1:\n\nInput 8 at (7,6).\n\nOutput 5s are at:\n\n(0,12), (1,9), (1,10), (1,11), (2,10), (2,11), (3,8), (3,9), (3,10), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (7,6) [the 8's position], (8,6), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (10,4), (11,2), (11,3), (11,4), (12,2).\n\nHmm. Looking at these positions, perhaps the 5s are arranged in a pattern where each arm of the star has three 5s, and each arm is in a specific direction. For instance, in Example0, the 5s are in directions like northeast, south-southwest, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the 5s are placed in a way that creates a larger diamond shape around the 8, but with each layer having more 5s. But the examples don't show a clear diamond layering.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output, the 5s are arranged in a way that each 'branch' has three 5s. For example:\n\n- The branch going up-right: (3,4) \u2192 (2,5) \u2192 (1,6) \u2192 (0,6). But (0,6) is only one step further than (1,6). So maybe each branch has three 5s, but the direction changes slightly.\n\nAlternatively, the branches could be arranged in a way that each has three 5s, but in a V shape. For example, the branch going northeast has three 5s forming a V: one at the top, then two below it. Like in Example0's first three rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each branch is a small arrow made of 5s. For example, in Example0's first output row, there's a single 5. In the row below, three 5s. Then another single. This forms an arrowhead pointing to the right. Similarly, the lower part has arrowheads pointing to the left.\n\nSo the pattern could be that around the 8, there are arrowheads pointing in all eight directions, each made of three 5s. For example:\n\n- Right arrow: three 5s in a row to the right.\n- Left arrow: three 5s to the left.\n- Up arrow: three 5s above.\n- Down arrow: three 5s below.\n- Diagonals similarly.\n\nBut looking at Example0's output, the right arrow isn't present. Instead, there's a right-pointing arrowhead in the upper part (rows 0-2), and a left-pointing arrowhead in the lower part (rows 5-7). So maybe the 8's position determines the direction of the arrows.\n\nWait, in Example0, the 8 is in the upper half of the grid. So the arrows above the 8 point right, and those below point left. Similarly, in Example1, the 8 is in the lower half, so the arrows below point left, and those above point right. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the arrows are placed in such a way that they form a symmetrical pattern around the 8. For example, in Example0, there's a right-pointing arrow above the 8 and a left-pointing arrow below. This symmetry might be based on the 8's position relative to the grid's center.\n\nAlternatively, the arrows are placed in the direction opposite to the 8's position. For instance, if the 8 is in the upper part, arrows point down, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the arrows are pointing away from the center of the grid. The grid is 13x13, so the center is at (6,6). In Example0, the 8 is at (3,4), which is to the north-west of the center. The arrows in the output might be pointing towards the opposite direction (southeast). But looking at Example0's output, the arrows seem to point to the right and left, not southeast.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Let's think differently. Maybe the 5s are placed in cells that are a certain mathematical function of the 8's coordinates. For example, each 5's position is determined by adding and subtracting certain values from the 8's row and column.\n\nIn Example0, the 8 is at (3,4). Let's look at some 5 positions:\n\n- (0,6): 3-3=0 row, 4+2=6 column.\n- (1,4), (1,5), (1,6): row 3-2=1, columns 4-0, 4+1, 4+2.\n- (2,4): row3-1=2, column4.\n- Similarly, (4,4) is row3+1, column4.\n- (5,2), (5,3), (5,4): row3+2, columns 4-2,4-1,4.\n- (6,2): row3+3, column4-2.\n- (7,0), (7,1), (7,2): row3+4, columns 4-4,4-3,4-2.\n- (8,0): row3+5, column4-4.\n- (9,0): row3+6, column4-4.\n\nHmm, this seems like for each step away from the 8's row, the column decreases by a certain amount. For example, in row0 (3 steps up), column increases by 2. In row1 (2 steps up), columns vary from 4 to 6. In row5 (2 steps down), columns decrease by 2. In row7 (4 steps down), columns decrease by 4. \n\nThis suggests that the column offset is equal to the row offset from the 8's position. For example, for each row i steps away from the 8's row, the column is offset by i steps in the opposite direction. Wait, not exactly. Let's see:\n\nIn row0 (3 steps up from row3), column is 6, which is 4+2. So row offset is 3, column offset is +2.\n\nIn row1 (2 steps up), columns are 4 (4+0), 5 (4+1), 6 (4+2). So the column offsets are 0,1,2 for row offset 2.\n\nIn row2 (1 step up), column is 4 (4+0).\n\nIn row5 (2 steps down), columns are 2,3,4. Which is 4-2, 4-1, 4-0. So for row offset +2, columns are -2, -1, 0.\n\nIn row6 (3 steps down), column is 2, which is 4-2.\n\nIn row7 (4 steps down), columns are 0,1,2 (4-4,4-3,4-2).\n\nIn row8 (5 steps down), column is 0 (4-4), but 5 steps down from row3 would be row8. 4-4=0.\n\nIn row9 (6 steps down), column 0 (4-4). But 6 steps down from row3 is row9 (3+6=9, since rows are 0-based).\n\nThis pattern seems to be that for each row offset from the 8's row (3), the column offset is equal to the row offset minus some value. For example, when moving up (negative row offset), the column increases by the row offset. When moving down (positive row offset), the column decreases by the row offset.\n\nWait, let's model it. Let's say the 8 is at (R, C).\n\nFor a row R + dr, the column is C + (dr) if dr is negative (up) or C - dr if dr is positive (down). But how does this fit the examples?\n\nIn Example0, R=3, C=4.\n\nFor dr = -3 (row0), column would be 4 + (-3) =1. But in Example0, the column is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the column offset is twice the row offset. For example, in row0 (dr=-3), column offset is +3*2=6, so 4+6=10, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the column offset is the row offset multiplied by some factor. But looking at Example0's row0, dr=-3, column is +2. So 2 = (-3)*k. That would mean k= -2/3. Not likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row away from the 8, the column shifts by a certain number of steps. For example, every two rows up, shift one column right. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the 5s are arranged in a way that the distance from the 8 increases in both row and column directions, creating a kind of spiral.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the number of 5s in each direction. In Example0's output, there are 5s in the following directions from the 8:\n\n- Up-right: (0,6)\n- Right: (1,5), (1,6)\n- Down-right: (4,4) \u2014 not sure.\n- Down-left: (5,2), (6,2), etc.\n- Left: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2)\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe the key is to realize that the output is a combination of four triangles or arrows pointing in different directions, each with three 5s. For example, in Example0, there's a right-pointing arrow above the 8 and a left-pointing arrow below. Similarly, maybe there are up and down arrows to the sides.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a series of concentric diamonds around the 8, but the examples only show one layer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the 5s are placed in cells where the sum of the row and column indices equals a certain value relative to the 8's position. For example, sum = R + C + k. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the 8 is at (3,4) (sum 7). The 5s in row0, column6 (sum 6). Row1, column6 sum 7. Row1, column5 sum 6. Row1, column4 sum 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the difference between row and column. For example, row - column. For the 8, 3-4=-1. For row0, column6: 0-6=-6. Doesn't seem relevant.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to see what the two training examples have in common. In both examples, the output has 5s arranged around the 8 in a symmetrical pattern, with multiple 5s forming lines in various directions. The number of 5s increases as you move away from the 8's row and column.\n\nAnother observation: in both examples, the output has the 8 at the same position as the input, and the 5s are arranged in a pattern that seems to have multiple 'arms' extending in different directions. Each arm consists of three 5s in a row, but the direction varies.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, there's a horizontal line of three 5s in row1 (columns4,5,6). Similarly, in row5, columns2,3,4. These are horizontal lines. There are also vertical lines: column4 in rows0,1,2,3,4. But not exactly. \n\nAlternatively, each arm is three 5s forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. For example, in Example0, the horizontal line in row1 (columns4-6), the vertical line in column4 (rows0-4), and diagonal lines like from (0,6) down to (3,4), but that's not three 5s.\n\nAlternatively, the arms are shaped like 'T's or 'L's. \n\nThis is taking too long. Perhaps the pattern is that the output is a mirror image of the 8's position across the center of the grid. The grid is 13x13, so the center is at (6,6). For Example0, the 8 is at (3,4). Mirroring across the center would be (6*2-3=9, 6*2-4=8) \u2192 (9,8). But in the output, there are 5s in row9, column0. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a rotation of the input. But the input has only one 8, so rotating would move the 8, but the output keeps the 8 in the same position. So that's not it.\n\nAnother Idea: The output could represent a numeral or letter, but that's unlikely given the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern involves replacing the 8 with a 5 and then creating a certain pattern around it. But the 8 remains in the output.\n\nWait, looking at the test input: the 8 is in row5, column5. So, according to the training examples, the output should have 5s arranged in a pattern around (5,5). Let's predict what that would look like.\n\nIn Example0, when the 8 was at (3,4), the output had 5s spreading to the right and left in certain rows. Similarly, when the 8 was at (7,6), the 5s spread to the right and left. For the test input's 8 at (5,5), the pattern would likely have 5s arranged in a symmetrical way around (5,5).\n\nFollowing the pattern from the training examples, the output for the test input would have 5s forming a similar star shape around (5,5). For example, in the rows above and below, there would be horizontal lines of 5s, and diagonal lines in other directions.\n\nSpecifically, looking at Example0's output:\n\n- Above the 8 (row3), there are rows 0-2 with 5s arranged in a pattern that fans out.\n- Below the 8, rows5-9 have 5s arranged similarly but in the opposite direction.\n\nFor the test input's 8 at (5,5), the pattern might have 5s in rows above and below, with horizontal lines and diagonal arms.\n\nFor example, in rows above 5 (rows0-4), there would be 5s forming right-pointing arrows, and rows below (rows6-12) would have left-pointing arrows. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, each row's 5s are placed such that their positions are determined by their distance from the 8's row. For instance, for each row i steps away from the 8's row, the columns with 5s are determined by a certain formula.\n\nIn Example0's output, the 8 is at row3. For rows above (i steps up):\n\n- i=3 (row0): column4 + 2 =6 \u2192 5 at (0,6)\n- i=2 (row1): columns4-0,4,4+1,4+2 \u2192 4,5,6 (three 5s)\n- i=1 (row2): column4 \u2192 single 5\n\nFor rows below (i steps down):\n\n- i=2 (row5): columns4-2,4-1,4 \u2192 2,3,4 (three 5s)\n- i=3 (row6): column4-2=2 \u2192 single 5\n- i=4 (row7): columns4-4=0,4-3=1,4-2=2 \u2192 three 5s\n- i=5 (row8): column0 \u2192 single 5\n- i=6 (row9): column0 \u2192 single 5\n\nThis suggests that for each row i steps away from the 8's row, the columns are determined by subtracting i from the 8's column (if below) or adding i (if above). But not exactly. For example, in row0 (i=3 steps up), column is 4 + 2 =6. Not 4+3=7.\n\nAlternatively, the column offset is floor(i/2). For i=3, 3/2=1.5 \u2192 1, so 4+1=5, but in Example0's row0, it's 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the column offset for row i steps up is i-1. For i=3 steps up, 3-1=2 \u2192 4+2=6. That matches row0's 5 at 6. For i=2 steps up (row1), 2-1=1 \u2192 4+1=5, but in row1, the columns are 4,5,6. So perhaps it's i-1 for the starting column, then three columns. Like for i=2 steps up, columns start at 4+ (2-1) =5? No, in row1, columns start at4.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Perhaps the pattern is that the 5s form a pattern where each row away from the 8's row has a horizontal line of 5s, centered around a column that shifts left or right depending on the direction. For example, each row above the 8 has a horizontal line of 5s shifted to the right, and each row below has lines shifted to the left. The length of the line increases as you move away from the 8's row up to a point, then decreases.\n\nIn Example0:\n\n- Rows above the 8 (row3):\n\nRow2: one 5 at column4.\nRow1: three 5s at columns4,5,6.\nRow0: one 5 at column6.\n\nRows below:\n\nRow4: one 5 at column4.\nRow5: three 5s at columns2,3,4.\nRow6: one 5 at column2.\nRow7: three 5s at columns0,1,2.\nRow8: one 5 at column0.\nRow9: one 5 at column0.\n\nSo the pattern above is: 1,3,1 (rows2,1,0). Below:1,3,1,3,1,1. Hmm, not exactly symmetrical.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each time you move two rows away from the 8's row, the horizontal line of 5s increases in length by two. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: The 5s form a pattern where each arm is a series of 5s arranged in a V-shape. For example, in Example0's upper part, the 5s form a V-shape pointing to the right. The bottom part forms a V pointing to the left. Each V has three levels. For example:\n\nUpper V:\n- Row0: 1 five (top of the V)\n- Row1: 3 fives (middle)\n- Row2: 1 five (bottom of the V)\n\nLower V:\n- Row5:3 fives\n- Row6:1 five\n- Row7:3 fives\n- Row8:1 five\n- Row9:1 five\n\nThis isn't a perfect V, but maybe the pattern is that for every two rows away from the 8, the direction of the V changes.\n\nFor the test input, where the 8 is at row5, column5, the output would have V-shapes above and below. The upper part would have V pointing right, and the lower part pointing left. The columns would shift based on the 8's position.\n\nSo, applying this to the test input:\n\nThe 8 is at (5,5). \n\nAbove the 8 (rows4,5,6? Wait, no: the 8 is at row5. So rows above are 0-4, and below are 6-12.\n\nFor the upper part (rows0-4):\n\n- Row5-3=2 steps up: row3. Maybe here we start the V. The V pointing to the right. So in row3, there's a single 5 at column5 +3-1=7? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, for each row i steps above the 8's row (5), the columns are arranged as follows:\n\nFor i steps up (row5 - i):\n\n- When i=1 (row4): column5 has a 5.\n- i=2 (row3): columns5-2=3,4,5? Or 5-1=4,5,6?\n- i=3 (row2): columns5-3=2,3,4,5,6,7?\nNo, this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, following the pattern from Example0 where the 8 is at row3:\n\nThe upper V in Example0 starts at row2 (i=1 up), has a single 5. Then row1 (i=2 up) has three 5s. Row0 (i=3 up) has a single 5. \n\nIf we apply this to the test input's 8 at row5:\n\nFor i=1 up (row4): single 5 at column5.\nFor i=2 up (row3): three 5s at columns5-1=4,5,6.\nFor i=3 up (row2): single 5 at column6.\nFor i=4 up (row1): three 5s at columns4,5,6 again?\nNot sure.\n\nBut in Example0, the upper V starts at row2 (i=1 up), then row1 (i=2 up) has three 5s, row0 (i=3 up) has one 5.\n\nSo for the test input's upper part:\n\nRow5-1=4: single 5 at column5.\nRow5-2=3: three 5s at columns4,5,6.\nRow5-3=2: single 5 at column6.\n\nThen for the lower part (rows6-12):\n\nRow5+1=6: single 5 at column4.\nRow5+2=7: three 5s at columns3,4,5.\nRow5+3=8: single 5 at column3.\nRow5+4=9: three 5s at columns2,3,4.\nRow5+5=10: single 5 at column2.\nRow5+6=11: three 5s at columns1,2,3.\nRow5+7=12: single 5 at column1.\n\nBut this is speculative. The test input's output would then have:\n\nRows4: [0,0,0,0,0,5,0,...]\nRow3: [0,0,0,4,5,6,0,...]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,...]\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,5,0,...]\nRow7: [0,0,0,3,4,5,0,...]\nRow8: [0,0,0,3,0,...]\nRow9: [0,0,2,3,4,0,...]\nRow10: [0,0,2,0,...]\nRow11: [0,1,2,3,0,...]\nRow12: [0,1,0,...]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the training examples.\n\nIn both examples, the output consists of 5s arranged in a pattern that mirrors the 8's position. For the test input's 8 at row5, column5, the output should have 5s forming a similar star pattern, with arms extending in all directions, each arm having three 5s. \n\nFor instance, above the 8, there would be a right-pointing arrowhead (single 5 in row3, three in row4, single in row5), and below, a left-pointing arrowhead. Diagonals would have similar patterns.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, I'll have to construct the output based on the training examples' symmetry. In Example0, the 8 is at (3,4), and the 5s are spread out in rows above and below. For the test input's 8 at (5,5), the output should have 5s spread similarly but adjusted for the new position.\n\nFollowing the pattern from Example0 and Example1, the output for the test input would have 5s arranged in a star pattern around (5,5), with each arm having three 5s in a specific direction. The exact positions would depend on mirroring the training examples but adjusting for the new 8 position.\n\nGiven the complexity, I'll proceed to write the output based on this reasoning.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples given.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has an 8 in the middle of the fourth row. The output shows a bunch of 5s arranged around that 8. The 5s form a kind of diamond or maybe a cross shape. Looking closer, the 8 is at position (3,4) if we start counting from 0. The output has 5s radiating out from that point in different directions. For example, above the 8, there are three 5s in a horizontal line, and below, similarly. Also, there are 5s in diagonal directions. Wait, maybe it's creating a diamond pattern with the 5s around the 8. But the exact arrangement isn't clear yet.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has an 8 in the seventh row, seventh column (assuming zero-based index). The output again has 5s arranged around it. This time, the 8 is at (7,6). The 5s form a sort of star pattern, maybe. Looking at the output rows, the 5s spread out in different directions. For instance, there's a line of 5s going up, then to the right, left, down, etc. The pattern here might be that each 8 in the input is surrounded by 5s in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) and the four diagonals, but perhaps extending outward for a certain distance.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the 8 is in the middle, and the 5s form a sort of plus sign and then an X. Like, vertically and horizontally, there are three 5s each direction, and diagonally as well. Let me count. For example, in Example 0's output, the first row with 5s is row 0, column 6. Then row 1 has columns 4,5,6 as 5. Row 2 has column 4 as 5. Then the 8 is in row 3, column 4. Then row 4 has column 4 again. So maybe each direction (up, down, left, right, diagonals) has a certain number of 5s. It looks like a diamond shape where each arm is three 5s long. For instance, from the 8, moving up three steps, each step placing a 5. Similarly for the other directions. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is the center, and 5s are placed at a distance of 1, 2, and 3 cells away in each of the eight directions. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 8 is at position (3,4). Looking up from there:\n\nRow 0, column 6 is three steps up and two to the right. Wait, that's not a straight line. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list the positions where the 5s are in Example 0's output.\n\nLooking at the output:\n\nFirst row (row 0): [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,...]. So column 6 has a 5. Then row 1 has columns 4,5,6 as 5s. Row 2 has column 4. Then row 3 (the 8's row) has column 4 as 8. Then row 4 has column 4 again. Then row 5 has columns 2,3,4. Row 6 has column 2. Then rows 7 and 8 have 5s in certain positions. Wait, maybe each direction from the 8 has a certain pattern. For example, the 5s form arrows pointing in all four diagonal and orthogonal directions. But each arrow has a certain length. For instance, the upward direction might have a 5 three cells above, then two below that. Or maybe each arm is three cells long, but arranged in a specific way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s form a specific symbol, like a star with eight points, each of a certain length. But the arrangement in the examples might be that each of the eight directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) has three 5s extending out from the 8. But how does that fit?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output again. The 8 is at (3,4). Then:\n\n- Moving up: The first 5 is at (0,6) which is three rows up and two columns right. That's northeast direction. Then in row 1, columns 4-6 have 5s, which could be part of a horizontal line. Wait, maybe each direction has a line of 5s. For example, the north direction might have three 5s going up, but that's not exactly the case here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s form a diamond shape where each layer is at a certain distance. The 8 is at the center, and each concentric diamond layer has 5s. But the first example's output has 5s at varying distances. Alternatively, it's a cross and an X combined. Let me see.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the vertical line through the 8 (column 4) has 5s in rows 1, 2, 4, 5. The horizontal line (row 3) has only the 8. Wait, no. The 8 is in row 3, column 4. The rows above and below have 5s in column 4. For instance, row 1 has 5 in column 4, row 2 has 5 in column 4, row 4 has 5 in column 4, row 5 has 5 in column 4 (as part of a group). Hmm, maybe the vertical line is column 4, and the horizontal line is row 3 (but the 8 is there). The cross would be vertical and horizontal lines, and the X is the diagonals. The 5s in the output could be forming a cross and X with three steps in each direction.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that around the 8, there are arrows pointing in eight directions, each arrow being three cells long. For example, in each of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals), there's a line of three 5s starting from the 8. But the 8 is only one cell, so the lines would start adjacent to it. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0, the 8 is at (3,4). Let's check the cells around it. The cell above (2,4) has a 5. Then (1,4) has a 5. Then (0,4) is 0. Wait, but in the output, row 0, column 6 is 5, which is northeast. Maybe each direction has a line of 5s, but not starting right next to the 8. Alternatively, the 5s are placed in a spiral or another pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the 5s form a specific pattern that's rotated based on the position of the 8. For example, in Example 0, the 8 is in the top half of the grid, so the 5s spread downward. But in Example 1, the 8 is lower, and the 5s spread upward. Hmm, looking at Example 1's output: the 8 is at row 7, column 6. The 5s above it are in rows 6, 5, 4, etc., and below in rows 8,9, etc. But the arrangement seems symmetrical. Maybe the 5s form a diamond pattern with the 8 at the center, and the diamond expanding in all directions but only up to a certain distance.\n\nAlternatively, the number 5 could be forming a specific geometric shape around the 8. Let me count the positions in Example 0's output. Let's list all the positions with 5s:\n\nRow 0, column 6: 5.\n\nRow 1: columns 4,5,6.\n\nRow 2: column4.\n\nRow3: 8 at column4.\n\nRow4: column4.\n\nRow5: columns2,3,4.\n\nRow6: column2.\n\nRow7: columns0,1,2.\n\nRow8: column0.\n\nRow9: column0.\n\nHmm. So the 5s form a kind of star with lines in various directions. For example, from the 8's position (row3, column4):\n\n- Up: in row0, column6. That's three rows up and two columns to the right. That's not a straight line. Maybe this is part of a diamond shape where each point is three steps away.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a hexagon or another shape. Alternatively, the 5s are arranged in a pattern that's mirrored in certain directions. For example, in Example 0, the 5s form a kind of arrow pointing northeast, and another pointing southwest. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the 8 as the center, and the 5s are placed in a pattern that's expanding in all directions, but with specific steps. For example, in each direction, the 5s are placed at a distance of 2,3, and 4 units away. Wait, but in Example0's row0, column6: the distance from (3,4) is (3 rows difference, 2 columns difference). The Manhattan distance is 5. But maybe it's part of a certain radius.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s form a 3x3 cross with the 8 in the center, but extended in certain ways. Wait, the first example's output has 5s in a vertical line (column4) from row1 to row5, and horizontal lines in rows1 and5 (columns4-6 and 2-4). Also, in row7 and8, columns0-2. So it's like multiple crosses or lines in different directions.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the 5s form a diamond shape around the 8, but each layer is a certain distance. For a diamond of radius 3, the cells at a Manhattan distance of 3 from the center would be filled. Let's check. The Manhattan distance from (3,4) to (0,6) is |3-0| + |4-6| = 3+2=5. That's not 3. So that's probably not it.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that the 5s form arrows in four directions, each arrow being three cells long, but in a specific arrangement. For example, in Example0:\n\nLooking at the 8 at (3,4):\n\n- There's a vertical line upwards: rows0,1,2. But in row0, column6 is 5. Wait, that's not vertically aligned. Maybe there are four arrows pointing in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), each of length 3, but arranged in a specific way.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, row0 has a 5 at column6, row1 has 5s at 4,5,6, row2 has 4. Then row5 has 2,3,4, row6 has 2. Rows7 and8 have 0,1,2. So maybe there are arrows pointing in the NE, SW, etc., directions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 5 is placed at positions that are two steps away in one direction and one step in another, forming a knight's move in chess. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, looking at Example1's output. The 8 is at (7,6). The 5s around it include positions like (0,12), (1,10-12), etc. Let's see. The first row of the output has a 5 in column12. Then the next row has 5s in columns10-12. Then in row2, column10. Then row3 has 5s in columns8-10. Row4 has column8. Row5 has 5s in columns5-7. Row6 has column5. Then the 8 is at row7, column6. Then row8 has column5. Row9 has columns5-7. Row10 has column8. Row11 has columns8-10. Row12 has column10. So this forms a diamond pattern expanding from the 8. Wait, maybe the pattern is that for each 8, the 5s are arranged in a diamond shape where each layer is a certain distance. For example, in Example1, the 8 is at (7,6). The 5s are placed at positions that form a diamond around it. For instance, the first layer (distance 1) would be adjacent cells, but in the output, the 5s are further away. Maybe each layer is spaced at a certain interval.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are arranged in a pattern that spirals out from the 8. But it's unclear.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the 5s relative to the 8. Let's take Example0:\n\nThe 8 is at (3,4). The 5s are at:\n\n(0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (9,0).\n\nLooking at these coordinates, what's the relation to (3,4)? Let's compute the differences:\n\nFor (0,6):\n\ndx = 0 -3 = -3, dy =6-4=2. So (-3, +2). Hmm. Similarly, (1,4): dx=-2, dy=0. (1,5): dx=-2, +1. (1,6): dx=-2, +2. (2,4): dx=-1, 0. (4,4): dx=+1, 0. (5,2): dx=+2, -2. (5,3): dx=+2, -1. (5,4): dx=+2, 0. (6,2): dx=+3, -2. (7,0): dx=+4, -4. (7,1): dx=+4, -3. (7,2): dx=+4, -2. (8,0): dx=+5, -4. (9,0): dx=+6, -4.\n\nHmm, this seems random. But perhaps each of these points lies on lines that pass through the 8's position with certain slopes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 5 is located at positions that are three cells away in a certain direction. For example, (0,6) is three rows up and two columns to the right. So that's a direction of up and right. Then (1,6) is two rows up and two columns right. So maybe each direction has steps of varying lengths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s form a specific geometric pattern, like a rotated 'V' shape in each quadrant around the 8. For example, in Example0, above the 8, there's a horizontal line of 5s at row1, columns4-6, then a single 5 at row0, column6. That looks like an arrow pointing to the northeast. Similarly, below the 8, in row5, columns2-4, and row6, column2. That's an arrow pointing southwest. Then in rows7-9, columns0-2, which points to the west or southwest. So maybe for each 8, the 5s form arrows in eight directions, each arrow consisting of three 5s arranged in a line.\n\nLooking at Example0:\n\n- Northeast arrow: starts at (1,6) and goes up to (0,6), but only two cells. Maybe three cells in a line with a certain slope.\n\nWait, perhaps each arrow has three 5s in a line, with slopes of 0, infinite, 1, -1, etc. For example, in Example0's output:\n\n- The horizontal line at row1: columns4-6 (three 5s).\n- The vertical line at column4: rows1,2,3 (8 at row3), 4,5 (but in row5 it's part of a horizontal line again). Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, for each of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals), there's a line of three 5s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\n- Right: from (3,4), moving right would be columns5,6,7. But there's no 5s there except in row1, column6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each line is three cells long, but starts at a distance from the 8. For example, in the northeast direction, three cells forming a diagonal line. For Example0, the line could be (0,6), (1,5), (2,4). But looking at the output, row0,6; row1,6; row2,4. That doesn't form a diagonal. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each 8 generates four V-shaped patterns in four quadrants. For example, in Example0, the 8 is at (3,4). The 5s form a V to the northeast (row0,6; row1,5-6; row2,4), a V to the southwest (rows5-7, columns2-4; rows7-9, columns0-2), etc. But this is getting a bit vague.\n\nAnother approach: compare the positions of the 8 in the two examples and see how the 5s are arranged relative to them.\n\nIn Example0, the 8 is at (3,4) (row3, column4). The output has 5s in a pattern that extends upwards and to the right, downwards and to the left, etc.\n\nIn Example1, the 8 is at (7,6). The output has 5s extending upwards and to the right (like row0, column12; row1, columns10-12), downwards and to the left (rows11-12, columns8-10), and so on.\n\nNoticing that in both examples, the 5s seem to form symmetrical patterns around the 8's position. For example, in Example0, the 8 is in the middle, and the 5s are arranged in a symmetrical pattern that's rotated 45 degrees. In Example1, the 8 is lower, and the 5s form a similar rotated pattern around it.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the 5s form a star with eight points, each point being three cells long, radiating from the 8's position. Each point is in a direction of 45 degrees apart. For example, up, up-right, right, down-right, down, down-left, left, up-left. Each direction has a line of three 5s.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with Example0.\n\nThe 8 is at (3,4). Let's check each direction:\n\n1. Up (0 degrees): three cells north. From (3,4), moving up three cells would be row0, column4. But in the output, row0, column4 is 0. But row0, column6 is 5. So that's not up.\n\nWait, maybe each direction is a knight's move. For example, in the up-right direction, moving three steps up and two steps right. Wait, in Example0's output, there's a 5 at (0,6). The difference from (3,4) is ( -3, +2). That could be part of a line. If each line has three 5s with that direction vector, then the next cell would be (3-3=0,4+2=6), then (0-3=-3,6+2=8) which is out of bounds. So only one 5 in that direction. But in the output, row0,6 is 5, and row1,6 is also 5. So maybe the direction is (-2, +2), leading to (1,6). Then (-1, +2) would be (2,6), but that's 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each direction has a certain step pattern. For example, in the northeast direction (up and right), each step is moving two rows up and two columns right. But from (3,4), stepping once would be (1,6), then (-1,8) which is invalid. So only one step. But in the output, there's a 5 at (1,6) and (0,6). That's not matching.\n\nThis approach is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, the 5s form a sort of fractal or recursive pattern. For example, in Example0's output, the 5s are arranged in smaller arrows that themselves form larger arrows. But that's vague.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s could be forming the outline of a larger digit or letter. But given that the output uses 5s and 8, perhaps the 8 is the center and the 5s form a pattern that represents something else. For example, maybe the 5s form a star around the 8. But how?\n\nAnother angle: the numbers 5 and 8. 5 is half of 10, and 8 is a common number. Maybe the 5s are arranged in a way that their count relates to the position of the 8. But I don't see a direct connection.\n\nAlternatively, think about the positions of the 8 and the 5s in terms of rows and columns. In Example0, the 8 is in row3, column4. The output's 5s are in rows 0-9, columns0-6. In Example1, the 8 is in row7, column6. The 5s are spread across different rows and columns. Maybe the 5s are placed in all cells that are a certain distance away from the 8's row or column. For example, cells that are three rows away or three columns away. But checking Example0: row0 is three rows above row3. Column6 is two columns away from column4. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s form a diamond shape where each layer is a certain distance from the 8. For example, in Example0:\n\nLayer 1: cells adjacent to 8 (but those are all 0 in the output).\n\nLayer 2: cells two steps away.\n\nLayer3: cells three steps away.\n\nBut in the output, the 5s are at varying distances. For example, (0,6) is three rows up and two columns right. Manhattan distance is 5. That's not a layer.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s are placed in cells where the row or column index has a certain relationship to the 8's position. For example, in Example0, the 8 is at row3. The 5s are in rows 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9. The rows where the 5s are could be (3 \u00b1 k) for k=1,2,3, etc. But the columns vary.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try to find a pattern between the two examples.\n\nIn both examples, the 8 is the only non-zero in the input. The output replaces the 8 with an 8 in the same position and adds 5s around it in a symmetrical pattern. The 5s are arranged in a way that they form symmetrical patterns around the 8.\n\nIn Example0, the 8 is near the top, and the 5s spread downward and to the sides. In Example1, the 8 is near the bottom, and the 5s spread upward and to the sides.\n\nThe pattern seems to be that the 5s form a kind of symmetrical \"explosion\" around the 8, with arms extending in different directions. Each arm has a certain number of 5s. Maybe each arm is three 5s long, arranged in a line, and there are eight arms (one in each direction: up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).\n\nWait, let's check Example0's output. How many arms are there?\n\n- Up: There's a vertical line of 5s in column4, rows1,2,3 (but 3 is the 8). Then row4 has a 5. So maybe that's an upward and downward arm. But it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, there are four arms: up, down, left, right, each with three 5s. But looking at Example0:\n\n- Up: rows0,1,2 in column4? No, row0 has 5 in column6.\n\nAlternatively, each arm has three 5s arranged in a diagonal line. For example, the northeast arm in Example0 has 5s at (0,6), (1,5), (2,4). But in the output, row0,6 is 5; row1,5 and 6 are 5s. So that line isn't straight. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the arms are at 45-degree angles. For instance, the northeast arm has three 5s going in the northeast direction. For example, from the 8's position, moving one step northeast (up and right), then another, etc. But in Example0, the 8 is at (3,4). Moving northeast once would be (2,5). Is there a 5 there? In the output, row2, column4 has a 5, which is directly north. So maybe not.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should think of the 5s as forming a diamond shape where each layer is a certain distance from the 8, but with varying cell counts.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each 5 is placed in positions that are a knight's move away from the previous one, forming a certain pattern. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the output in Example0 has 5s that form a larger '5' shape around the 8. But it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s form a pattern that's the same regardless of where the 8 is placed. For example, if the 8 is at (x,y), then the 5s are placed at (x\u00b13, y), (x\u00b12, y\u00b12), (x, y\u00b13), etc. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example0's 8 at (3,4):\n\n- (3+3,4) = (6,4). In the output, row6 has a 5 at column2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, (3-3,4+2) = (0,6), which is a 5 in the output. (3-2,4+2) = (1,6), which is a 5. (3-1,4+2) = (2,6), which is 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s are placed at positions (x \u00b1 a, y \u00b1 b) where a and b follow a certain sequence. For example, in Example0:\n\n(3-3,4+2) = (0,6)\n\n(3-2,4+1) = (1,5)\n\n(3-2,4+2) = (1,6)\n\n(3-1,4+0) = (2,4)\n\n(3+2,4-2) = (5,2)\n\n(3+4,4-4) = (7,0)\n\nEtc. These positions have 5s. But what's the pattern here? It seems like combinations of subtracting 3, 2, 1 from the row and adding 2, 1, 0 to the column. But I can't see a clear rule.\n\nAnother idea: the output for each example is a rotated version of the same pattern, depending on where the 8 is located. For instance, if the 8 is in the top part of the grid, the 5s are arranged in a certain way, and if it's in the bottom, the pattern is rotated 180 degrees. Let's compare the two examples.\n\nIn Example0's output, the 5s are mostly in the upper part of the grid, while in Example1, they are spread across the lower part. But this isn't a rotation; Example1's output has 5s both above and below the 8. Wait, in Example1, the 8 is at row7, column6. The output has 5s in rows0-6 (above) and rows8-12 (below). So it's symmetrical vertically around the 8's row. But the pattern isn't a simple mirror.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the 8 is in row3, and the 5s are above and below. In Example1, the 8 is in row7, and the 5s are above and below as well. So maybe the pattern is symmetrical vertically and horizontally around the 8's position.\n\nBut how does that explain the specific placement of 5s?\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is a diamond shape where each layer has a certain number of 5s. For example, the first layer (distance 1) has no 5s, the second layer (distance 2) has some, etc. But in the outputs, the 5s are placed at varying distances.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that the 5s are placed in cells that form a certain mathematical relationship with the 8's coordinates. For example, in Example0, the 8 is at (3,4). The 5s are at positions where row + column equals certain values. Let's see:\n\nRow0,6: 0+6=6.\n\nRow1,4:5; 1+4=5.\n\nRow1,5:6.\n\nRow1,6:7.\n\nRow2,4:6.\n\nRow3,4:7 (8's position).\n\nRow4,4:8.\n\nRow5,2:7.\n\nRow5,3:8.\n\nRow5,4:9.\n\nRow6,2:8.\n\nRow7,0:7.\n\nRow7,1:8.\n\nRow7,2:9.\n\nRow8,0:8.\n\nRow9,0:9.\n\nNot sure if that helps. The sum varies and doesn't seem to form a pattern.\n\nAnother idea: the 5s are placed in cells that form a certain geometric shape when connected. For instance, in Example0's output, connecting the 5s forms a star with multiple points. Alternatively, it's a fractal-like pattern.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 5s as forming a path that spirals out from the 8. But I don't see a clear spiral.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for a pattern that can be applied to any position of the 8. Let's consider that the output for each example is generated by placing the 8 and then adding 5s in a specific pattern around it, regardless of the 8's position. The pattern might be that from the 8's position, there are four diagonal lines of 5s, each consisting of three 5s, and four straight lines (horizontal and vertical), each also with three 5s. So in total, eight directions, each with three 5s.\n\nFor example, in the north direction (up), three 5s would be placed in the cells above the 8. Similarly for south, east, west, and the four diagonals. But how does this fit with the examples?\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example0. The 8 is at (3,4). North direction would be rows2,1,0 in column4. Looking at the output:\n\nRow2, column4:5.\n\nRow1, column4:5.\n\nRow0, column4:0.\n\nSo only two 5s. That doesn't fit. But in the output, row0 has a 5 at column6, which is northeast. Maybe the lines are in other directions.\n\nAlternatively, each line is three cells long, but starts one cell away from the 8. For example, north would have 5s at (2,4), (1,4), (0,4). But in the output, only (2,4) and (1,4) are 5s. So maybe the lines are shorter. Or maybe the lines are of varying lengths depending on the direction.\n\nAlternatively, the lines are placed such that they form a larger shape. For example, in Example0's output, the 5s form a larger '5' number. But I can't see that.\n\nAnother observation: in both training examples, the 8's row and column have 5s in certain positions. For Example0, the 8 is in row3, column4. The output has 5s in column4 of rows1,2,4,5. And in row3, there's the 8. So vertically, there are 5s above and below. Horizontally, in row1, columns4-6. And in row5, columns2-4. So maybe there's a vertical line and two horizontal lines forming a cross, plus diagonal lines.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the 5s form a diamond shape with the 8 at the center, and the diamond has a certain radius. For example, radius 3, but the exact positions are computed based on that.\n\nThe diamond shape in a grid can be defined by cells where the Manhattan distance from the center is less than or equal to a certain value. For example, a diamond with radius 3 would include all cells (x,y) such that |x - cx| + |y - cy| <=3, where (cx, cy) is the center.\n\nFor Example0's 8 at (3,4), the Manhattan distance 3 diamond would include cells from row0 to row6 and column1 to column7. But looking at the output, the 5s are not within that area. For instance, (0,6) has a Manhattan distance of 3-0 +6-4=3+2=5, which is greater than 3. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by a cellular automaton-like rule. For example, starting with the 8, then placing 5s in neighboring cells based on certain rules for each step. But without more examples, it's hard to infer the rule.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s are placed in such a way that they form a path that visits each cell once, but that's unlikely given the examples.\n\nWait, looking back at Example0 and Example1's outputs, they both have a structure where the 5s are arranged in lines that are three cells long. For example, in Example0's output:\n\n- Row1: three 5s (columns4-6).\n\n- Row5: three 5s (columns2-4).\n\n- Row7: three 5s (columns0-2).\n\nSimilarly, columns in rows0-2 and others.\n\nSo each of these lines is three 5s long, placed in different positions. Maybe the pattern is that from the 8's position, in each of the eight directions, there's a line of three 5s. The lines are placed such that they form a star-like pattern.\n\nFor example, in Example0's 8 at (3,4), there are lines:\n\n- North-east: (3,4) -> (2,5) -> (1,6) -> (0,7) (but 0,7 is 0). But in the output, there are 5s at (0,6), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4). So this doesn't form a straight line.\n\nAnother possibility: each line of three 5s is placed in a direction that is a knight's move away. For example, two steps in one direction and one in another. But this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the 5s are placed in cells where the row or column index matches certain criteria related to the 8's position. For example, rows that are even or odd based on the 8's row.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s form a certain mathematical pattern, like a magic square or a Latin square. But I don't see how that applies here.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern that can be applied to any 8's position. For example, the output consists of several 'arms' radiating from the 8, each arm consisting of three 5s. Each arm is in a different direction. The directions could be the four cardinal directions and the four diagonals. Each arm extends three cells in that direction, but the placement of 5s might vary.\n\nFor instance, in Example0's output:\n\n- The arm to the right (east) has three 5s: (3,4+1), (3,4+2), (3,4+3). But in the input, the 8 is at (3,4), and the output doesn't have 5s to the east. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, each arm is placed in a direction but starts a few cells away. For example, three 5s forming a horizontal line three rows above the 8. In Example0, row0, column6 is part of such a line. But it's not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in both examples, the 5s form a pattern that seems to have four 'clusters' of 5s arranged in a symmetrical fashion around the 8. For example, in Example0, there are clusters to the northeast, southwest, and west. In Example1, they are to the northeast, southwest, etc.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that for each 8, four diamonds of 5s are placed around it, each diamond rotated 90 degrees. Each diamond has three 5s. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s form a pattern of arrows pointing in eight directions, each arrow consisting of three 5s. For example, in Example0, there's an arrow pointing northeast (row0,6; row1,6; row1,5), another pointing southwest (row5,2; row5,3; row6,2), etc. But the arrangement is not consistent.\n\nAfter much consideration, I think the pattern is that the 5s form a diamond shape around the 8, but the diamond is rotated 45 degrees. The diamond has a certain radius, and the 5s are placed at the vertices and along the edges of this diamond. For example, in Example0, the diamond's vertices are at (0,6), (6,2), (9,0), and other points. But this is not a standard diamond shape.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is a mathematical function. For example, each 5 is placed at positions where the sum of the row and column indices equals a certain value related to the 8's position. For instance, for the 8 at (x,y), 5s are placed where row + column = x + y + k, where k is a certain constant. But checking Example0:\n\n8 is at (3,4). x+y=7. In Example0's output, (0,6) sum is 6. (1,5) sum is6. (1,6) sum is7. (2,4) sum is6. (5,2) sum is7. (5,3) sum is8. etc. Not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the difference between row and column indices. For Example0's 8, row - column =3-4=-1. The 5s in the output have varying differences: 0-6=-6, 1-4=-3, 1-5=-4, etc. Not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to look for a pattern in the positions of the 5s relative to the 8's position. For example, in Example0:\n\nThe 8 is at (3,4). The 5s are placed at:\n\n(0,6) \u2192 \u0394row=-3, \u0394col=+2\n\n(1,4) \u2192 \u0394row=-2, \u0394col=0\n\n(1,5) \u2192 \u0394row=-2, \u0394col=+1\n\n(1,6) \u2192 \u0394row=-2, \u0394col=+2\n\n(2,4) \u2192 \u0394row=-1, \u0394col=0\n\n(4,4) \u2192 \u0394row=+1, \u0394col=0\n\n(5,2) \u2192 \u0394row=+2, \u0394col=-2\n\n(5,3) \u2192 \u0394row=+2, \u0394col=-1\n\n(5,4) \u2192 \u0394row=+2, \u0394col=0\n\n(6,2) \u2192 \u0394row=+3, \u0394col=-2\n\n(7,0) \u2192 \u0394row=+4, \u0394col=-4\n\n(7,1) \u2192 \u0394row=+4, \u0394col=-3\n\n(7,2) \u2192 \u0394row=+4, \u0394col=-2\n\n(8,0) \u2192 \u0394row=+5, \u0394col=-4\n\n(9,0) \u2192 \u0394row=+6, \u0394col=-4\n\nLooking at these \u0394row and \u0394col values, I notice that many of them are multiples of 2 or 3. For example, \u0394row=-3, \u0394col=+2 (which is 3 and 2, sum to 5). There's also \u0394row=+4, \u0394col=-4 (sum 0). But it's unclear if there's a pattern here.\n\nAnother angle: the absolute values of \u0394row and \u0394col. For example, in (0,6), \u0394row=3, \u0394col=2. The sum is 5. In (1,4), \u0394row=2, sum is 2. In (1,5), sum is 3. Not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the product of \u0394row and \u0394col. For example, 3*2=6, 2*0=0, 2*1=2, etc. Again, no clear pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0's output, the 5s are placed at positions where either the row or column is a multiple of 3 or 4, but this seems coincidental.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s are placed at positions that form a certain geometric shape relative to the 8's position. For instance, in Example0, the 5s form a larger '8' around the central 8. But that's not evident.\n\nAfter extensive analysis without a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. The pattern seems to involve placing 5s in a symmetrical arrangement around the 8's position, possibly in all eight directions, each direction having three 5s. The exact placement might involve creating arrows or lines in each direction. For the test input, where the 8 is in row5, column5 (assuming zero-based, since the input is row5, index5), the output should have 5s arranged similarly to the training examples, but adjusted for the new position.\n\nIn the test input, the 8 is at row5, column5. So applying the same pattern as in the training examples, the 5s would be placed in positions radiating out in all directions. For example, north-east, south-west, etc. Each direction would have a line of three 5s. Let's try to construct this.\n\nFor the test case's 8 at (5,5):\n\n- North-east direction: three cells moving up and right. Starting from (5,5), maybe three cells in that direction. For example, (5-3,5+3)= (2,8), but the grid is 13 columns (indexes 0-12). So column8 is valid. Then the line would be (2,8), (3,7), (4,6), (5,5). But the 8 is at (5,5), so the 5s would be in (2,8), (3,7), (4,6). But I need to check if this fits the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example0's 8 at (3,4), the northeast line had 5s at (0,6), (1,5), (2,4). But wait, (3-3,4+2) = (0,6). (3-2,4+1) = (1,5). (3-1,4+0) = (2,4). So each step is subtracting 1 from row and adding 0.5 to column, which isn't possible. This suggests that each step in the northeast direction decreases the row by 1 and increases the column by 1. But in Example0, the 5s are at (0,6), (1,6), (1,5), which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each direction, the line is three 5s in a specific pattern. For example, in Example0's northeast direction, the line is three 5s forming a horizontal line. So perhaps for each direction, the line is a horizontal or vertical segment of three 5s.\n\nAlternatively, for the test input, the 5s will be arranged in a similar pattern to the training examples but centered at (5,5). For example:\n\n- Three 5s to the north-east: starting at row2, column8.\n\n- Three 5s to the south-west: starting at row8, column2.\n\n- Etc.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to determine. However, based on the training examples, the output will have multiple clusters of 5s arranged symmetrically around the 8's position. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to create an output for the test input by mirroring the pattern from the training examples. In Example0, the 8 was in row3, column4, and the 5s formed clusters in certain directions. For the test input's 8 at row5, column5, the clusters would be shifted accordingly.\n\nFor example, in the test input, the output might have 5s in:\n\n- Row5-3=2, column5+3=8.\n\n- Row5-2=3, columns5+2=7.\n\n- Row5-1=4, column5+1=6.\n\n- Similarly for other directions.\n\nBut this is speculative. Based on Example1, when the 8 was in row7, column6, the 5s were placed in columns 12, 10-12, etc. So moving the 8 to the right increases the column indices of the 5s. \n\nGiven that the test input's 8 is at row5, column5 (middle of the grid), the output might have 5s radiating out in all directions, forming a symmetrical pattern. For example:\n\n- North: row2, column5.\n\n- South: row8, column5.\n\n- East: row5, column8.\n\n- West: row5, column2.\n\n- Diagonals: row2, column8; row8, column2; row2, column2; row8, column8.\n\nAnd each of these directions has three 5s. But again, without knowing the exact pattern, this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output might look like this for the test input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut this is a guess based on Example0's pattern. However, since the test input's 8 is in row5, column5, the pattern might need to be adjusted. For instance, the clusters might be in different quadrants. For example, the output might have 5s in the following rows and columns:\n\n- Row5-3=2, column5+3=8: 5.\n\n- Row5-2=3, columns5+2=7 and surrounding.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's difficult. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to write an output that follows the pattern observed in the training examples, adjusted for the test input's 8 position.",
