        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I notice that the input and output matrices have some changes, especially around the 8s and 4s. Let me go through each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has three rows with 8s. The first row is [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0], and the output becomes [8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0]. So, the first element changed from 0 to 8, and the third element from 0 to 8. Similarly, the second row input is [0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0], output is [8,8,0,0,8,8,0,0,0]. The first two zeros became 8 and 8. Third row input [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0] becomes [8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0], so first element becomes 8. \n\nHmm, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions around the 8s are being filled. Like, perhaps the 8s are expanding to the left or some direction. Let's check the positions. In the first row of Example 0's input, the 8s are at positions 3 and 5 (0-indexed). In the output, positions 0 and 2 are 8 now. Wait, how does that relate? Maybe for each 8, we look to the left two positions and set that to 8? Let's see. If original 8 is at position 3, left two positions would be 1 (3-2=1), but in the output, position 0 and 2 are 8. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe each 8 causes two new 8s to the left. For example, in the first input row, two 8s at positions 3 and 5. Each of them adds an 8 two places to the left. Position 3-2=1, but the output has 8 at 0 and 2. Wait, maybe the leftmost 8 is causing something. Or perhaps it's a mirroring effect. Alternatively, maybe each 8 in the input is creating 8s in certain positions in the same row, perhaps left and right. Wait, in the first row output, the 8s are at 0, 2, 3,5. So original 3 and 5. The new ones are 0 and 2. So maybe each 8 adds a new 8 two positions to the left. So 8 at position 3 would add 8 at 3-2=1. But in the output, it's 0 and 2. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe each 8 in the input causes the two positions to the left of it to become 8. So for example, if there's an 8 at position 3, then positions 1 and 2 become 8. But in Example 0's first input row, positions 3 and 5 are 8. For position 3, left two positions are 1 and 2. So those would become 8. But in the output, positions 0 and 2 are 8, not 1 and 2. That doesn't align. Maybe it's something else.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input first row is [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0], output is [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8]. So new 8s at positions 6 and 8. Original 8s are at 3 and 5. So maybe each 8 is adding 8s two positions to the right. 3+2=5, but that's already an 8. Wait, 5+2=7, but there's no 8 at 7. Alternatively, maybe each 8 in the input row creates new 8s to the right. But in Example 0's output, the 8s are added to the left. So maybe the direction depends on something else. Or maybe the rows with 8s are part of a group, and their transformation is different from rows with 4s. Wait, looking at all examples, the 4s in the input remain the same in the output. The transformation seems to only affect the upper half (rows with 8s) and the lower half (rows with 4s) stay the same. So the transformation is applied to rows where 8s are present, but the 4s are left as is.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the transformation is to mirror or duplicate 8s in certain positions. Let me look at the first example again. Input row 0: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0]. Output becomes [8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0]. The new 8s are at positions 0 and 2. Original 8s are at 3 and 5. Position 0 is 3-3=0, position 2 is 3-1=2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 8s in the input row are acting as centers, and we add 8s at certain offsets. For example, for each 8, add 8s two positions to the left and right. But in Example 0's first input row, the 8s are at 3 and 5. Adding left and right two positions: for 3, left two is 1, right two is 5. But in the output, position 0 and 2 are 8s. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row with 8s is being shifted in some way. For instance, in Example 0's first input row, shifting the 8s to the left by one or two positions. But shifting 3 and 5 left by one would be 2 and 4, but output has 8s at 0 and 2,3,5. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe each row is split into three sections. The original 8s are in positions 3,4,5 in some rows, and the output adds 8s in positions 0,1,2. Like a reflection. For instance, in Example 0's first row, the 8s are in positions 3 and 5. The output has 8s in 0,2,3,5. So mirroring the 8s to the left side? Like taking the 8s in the right half and mirroring them to the left. Let's check. The original 8s are at 3 and 5. If mirrored across the middle (position 4), 3 would mirror to 5, but that's already there. Wait, maybe the left half (positions 0-4) and right half (positions 4-8) are being mirrored. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input first row: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0] becomes [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8]. The new 8s are at positions 6 and 8. Original 8s at 3 and 5. So 3+3=6, 5+3=8. So maybe each 8 in the input row adds a new 8 three positions to the right. Let's check: 3+3=6, 5+3=8. That works here. Then in Example 0's first row, 3+3=6 and 5+3=8. But in the output, the 8s are at 0 and 2. That doesn't fit. Hmm, so this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in each row, for every 8 present, we add 8s two positions to the left and right. But that's inconsistent with the examples. Let's test Example 0 first row: 8s at 3 and 5. Adding left and right two positions. For 3: left two is 1, right two is 5. But 5 is already an 8. So adding 8 at 1. For 5: left two is 3 (already 8), right two is 7. So output would have 8s at 1 and 7. But the actual output has 8s at 0 and 2. So that doesn't align.\n\nWait, perhaps the direction is different. Looking at the outputs in Example 0, the added 8s are to the left of the original 8s. For the first row, original 8s are at 3 and 5. The output has 8s at 0,2,3,5. So maybe for each 8 in the input, we place an 8 two positions to the left and one position to the left. Or maybe a certain offset.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are being duplicated in a way that forms a diamond or a certain shape. For example, in Example 0's first row input: the two 8s are at positions 3 and 5. The output has 8s at 0,2,3,5. So positions 0 and 2. How are those related? 0 is three positions left of 3, and 2 is one position left of 3. Maybe each 8 in the input is generating 8s in a pattern that moves leftwards by certain steps. For example, from position 3, add 8s at 3-3=0 and 3-1=2. Then for position 5, 5-3=2 and 5-1=4. But in the output, position 4 is 0. Hmm, this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a rotation or reflection of the upper part of the matrix. Let's look at the structure. The input in the upper three rows (where the 8s are) might be transformed by flipping or rotating. For example, in Example 0, the first three rows of input are:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n\nRow1: 0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0\n\nRow2: 0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n\nOutput for these rows:\n\nRow0:8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0\n\nRow1:8,8,0,0,8,8,0,0,0\n\nRow2:8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n\nLooking at these, perhaps the first three rows are being shifted or mirrored. For instance, in row0 of output, the first three elements (positions 0-2) are 8,0,8. The original elements were 0,0,0. So it's like replacing the first three elements with a pattern derived from the 8s. For example, the first three elements might be a reversed version of the 8s in the row. Let's see: original row0 has 8s at 3 and 5. The output's first three elements are 8,0,8. Maybe taking the first three elements as the reverse of the last three non-zero elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output for the upper rows is mirroring the 8s to the left side. For example, if the input has 8s in the middle or right part, the output adds 8s to the left side symmetrically. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's row0 input: 8s at positions 3 and5. Output has 8s at 0,2,3,5. So 0 and 2 are mirrored across the center. The center is position4. 3 mirrored around center would be 5 (since 4-3=1, so 4+1=5), but original 3 and5 are both 8. But adding 0 and2, which are positions 4-4=0 and 4-2=2. Wait, maybe the pattern is that for each 8 in the input, add an 8 at position (4 - (original position -4)), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s in the input are being \"expanded\" to the left in a certain way. For example, each 8 in the input row leads to adding 8s two positions to the left. Let's test this:\n\nIn Example0's row0: 8 at position3. Two positions left is 1. 8 at position5. Two left is 3. But in the output, positions0 and2 have 8s. So that doesn't fit. Maybe three positions left? Position3-3=0. Position5-3=2. Ah, that works. So for each 8 in the input row, subtract 3 from their positions and place an 8 there. So original positions 3 and5 would lead to 0 and2. That's exactly what we see in Example0's row0 output. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample0's row1 input: 0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0. The output is 8,8,0,0,8,8. So original 8s at4 and5. Subtract3: 4-3=1, 5-3=2. So positions1 and2. In the output row1, positions0 and1 are 8. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, output row1 starts with 8,8. So positions0 and1. But according to this idea, positions1 and2 would be 8s. So maybe the formula is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each 8 in the input, add an 8 three positions to the left. But for row1 input's 8s at4 and5, subtract3 would be 1 and2. But output has 8s at0 and1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's adding 8s in positions that are three less than the original, but if the result is negative, wrap around? That doesn't make sense here.\n\nWait, looking at Example1's input row0: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0]. Output row0: [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8]. Original 8s at3 and5. The new 8s are at6 and8. 3+3=6,5+3=8. So adding 3 to the original positions. That would make sense here. Then, for Example0's row0, adding 3 would be 6 and8, but in the output, the new 8s are at0 and2. So this contradicts. Unless there's a different rule for different examples. That seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction depends on the row. Maybe in some rows the 8s are shifted left, others right. But how to determine that.\n\nLooking at Example2's input:\n\nRow0:0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 output row0:0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0. So original 8 at3. Output adds 8 at2. So 3-1=2.\n\nRow1 input:0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0 \u2192 output row1:8,8,0,0,8,8,0,0,0. Original 8s at4 and5. Output adds 8s at0 and1. So 4-4=0, 5-4=1.\n\nRow2 input:0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 output row2:0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0. Original 8 at3. Output adds 8 at2 (3-1=2).\n\nHmm, this is inconsistent. Maybe it's not a fixed offset. Alternatively, the offset depends on the row index. For example, in row0, subtract 3, in row1 subtract4, etc. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the transformation is to take the positions of the 8s in each row and generate new 8s in positions that are a certain pattern. For example, for each 8 in the input row, create a new 8 in the same row but shifted left by a certain number of positions, which depends on the row's position. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow0 (input): positions3 and5. Output: positions0,2,3,5. So two new 8s at0 and2. How are these derived from 3 and5? 0 is 3 -3, 2 is5-3. So if for row0, shift left by3 positions.\n\nRow1 input: positions4 and5. Output: positions0,1,4,5. So 0=4-4,1=5-4. So shift left by4.\n\nRow2 input: position5. Output: position0,5. So 0=5-5. Shift left by5.\n\nWait, row index starts at0. So for row0, shift left by3: 3-3=0,5-3=2. For row1, shift left by4:4-4=0,5-4=1. For row2, shift left by5:5-5=0. This seems to fit. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0 input: 8s at3 and5. Output: new 8s at6 and8. Wait, but according to the previous pattern, row0 would shift left by3. 3+3=6,5+3=8. Oh, but in Example1, the new 8s are to the right. So this contradicts. So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe for some examples, it's a right shift. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift direction alternates based on some condition. But how to determine that.\n\nWait, looking at Example1's output for row0: new 8s at6 and8. Original positions3 and5. So 3+3=6,5+3=8. So adding 3 positions to the right. So in Example0, the shift was left, here it's right. What's different between the examples?\n\nLooking at the input structures, maybe the initial arrangement of 8s determines the direction. In Example0, the 8s are in the middle and right, so shift left. In Example1, maybe the 8s are more to the left, so shift right? Not sure. Let's check Example1's input row0: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0]. So same as Example0's row0. But the output here adds to the right. So that can't be it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different rule for each example. But that's unlikely. The pattern must be consistent across all examples.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is to take the positions of 8s in the input row and create a symmetric pattern around the center of the row. For example, each 8 in the input is mirrored across the center. Let's test:\n\nCenter of a 9-element row is position4 (0-indexed). So mirroring an 8 at position3 would be position5 (since 4 -3 =1, so 4 +1=5). Similarly, mirroring position5 would be 3. But in Example0's row0 input has 3 and5. Mirroring would add their mirrors, but they are already present. So the output's new 8s are at0 and2. How does that relate? Maybe the entire row is mirrored. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row0 input: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0]. If mirrored, it becomes [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0], same as input. But output is [8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0]. So mirroring isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are being expanded in a diamond shape. For example, each 8 creates 8s in positions that form a diamond around it. But I'm not seeing how this applies here.\n\nLet me try to compare all examples' inputs and outputs to find a common transformation.\n\nExample0 input row0: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0] \u2192 output [8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0]. The new 8s are at 0 and 2. Original 8s at3 and5. The distance between 0 and3 is3, between2 and5 is3. So maybe adding 8s three positions left of the original. For example, 3-3=0, 5-3=2. That would explain the new 8s in row0.\n\nExample0 row1 input: [0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0] \u2192 output [8,8,0,0,8,8,0,0,0]. Original 8s at4 and5. Subtract4-4=0,5-4=1. So new 8s at0 and1.\n\nExample0 row2 input: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0] \u2192 output [8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]. Original 8 at5. Subtract5-5=0. New 8 at0.\n\nSo it seems that for each row in the upper half, the shift is equal to the row index multiplied by some value. Let's see:\n\nRow0: shift left by3 \u2192 3 positions.\n\nRow1: shift left by4 \u2192 4 positions.\n\nRow2: shift left by5 \u21925 positions.\n\nBut row index starts at0. So row0 shift 3, row1 shift4, row2 shift5. The shift increases by1 each row. That's 3+0=3, 3+1=4,3+2=5. So shift is 3 + row index.\n\nYes! For example:\n\nRow0: shift left by 3 (3+0) \u2192 original positions3 and5. 3-3=0,5-3=2 \u2192 new positions0 and2.\n\nRow1: shift left by4 (3+1). Original positions4 and5. 4-4=0,5-4=1 \u2192 new positions0 and1.\n\nRow2: shift left by5 (3+2). Original position5.5-5=0 \u2192 new position0.\n\nThis seems to fit for Example0. Let's check Example1.\n\nExample1 input row0: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0] \u2192 output [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8]. Original 8s at3 and5. Shift left by3 \u2192 new positions0 and2. But output has new 8s at6 and8. So this doesn't fit. Wait, maybe in Example1, the shift is to the right. Like original positions3 and5 shifted right by3 \u2192 3+3=6,5+3=8. Which matches the output.\n\nHmm, so why in Example0 the shift is left, and in Example1 it's right? What's the difference between the two examples?\n\nLooking at the input structures, maybe it depends on the presence of other 8s in the row. Example0's row0 has two 8s, Example1's row0 also has two 8s. Or perhaps the direction alternates based on some other factor. Alternatively, maybe the shift direction is determined by the row's position in the upper half. But how.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the new 8s are added to the left, while in Example1's output, the new 8s are added to the right. Looking at the inputs, perhaps the shift direction is determined by the number of 8s in the row. For Example0's row0: two 8s, shifted left. Example1's row0: two 8s, shifted right. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift direction alternates between left and right based on the example. But that's not logical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern involves both left and right shifts. Like for each 8 in the input row, create a new 8 shifted left by (3 + row index) and right by (3 + row index). But then positions would wrap around, which might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, the shift direction is determined by the row's position. For example, in even rows, shift left; in odd rows, shift right. But Example0's row0 (even) shifted left. Example1's row0 shifted right. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the original 8 positions. For Example0's row0, the original 8s are at positions3 and5. If shifted left by3, they add 0 and2. If shifted right by3, they add6 and8. So which one is used depends on some condition. But how.\n\nLooking at Example1's output row0: new 8s are at6 and8. So shifted right by3. So in Example0, it's shifted left; in Example1, shifted right. What's the difference between the two examples?\n\nWait, looking at the lower half (rows with 4s), in Example0 and Example1, the lower three rows are the same. So the difference is in the upper three rows. The transformation for the upper rows might depend on something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift direction is determined by the presence of 4s in the lower rows. But the lower rows are the same in Example0 and Example1, so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction alternates between left and right based on the row's index. For example, row0 shifts left, row1 shifts right, row2 shifts left again, etc. But let's check:\n\nExample0's row0 (0) shifts left \u2192 new 8s at0,2.\n\nRow1 (1) shifts right \u2192 but in Example0's row1 output, new 8s are at0,1. So shifting left. So this idea doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Let's look at the differences between input and output rows for the upper half.\n\nIn Example0's upper three rows:\n\nOriginal row0: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0] \u2192 output adds 8s at0 and2.\n\nOriginal row1: [0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0] \u2192 output adds 8s at0 and1.\n\nOriginal row2: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0] \u2192 output adds 8 at0.\n\nIn Example1's upper three rows:\n\nOriginal row0: same as Example0's row0 input \u2192 output adds 8s at6 and8.\n\nOriginal row1: [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0] \u2192 output adds 8s at6,7,8 (positions6:8,7:8,8:8).\n\nOriginal row2: [0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0] \u2192 output adds 8s at6,7.\n\nSo in Example1, the new 8s are added to the right side. So the shift direction is to the right. Why?\n\nWhat's different between Example0 and Example1? In Example0's upper rows, the 8s are arranged differently. For example, row0 has 8s at3 and5, row1 has 8s at4 and5, row2 has 8 at5. In Example1, the upper rows have more 8s. Row0 has 8s at3 and5, row1 has 8s at3,4,5, row2 has 8s at3 and4.\n\nSo perhaps the direction of the shift (left or right) depends on the arrangement of the 8s in the row. For example, if the 8s are more towards the left, shift right; if towards the right, shift left. But how to quantify that.\n\nAlternatively, the shift direction is determined by the leftmost 8 in the row. For example, if the leftmost 8 is in a position less than a certain value, shift right; otherwise, shift left. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, the shift direction is determined by the row's 8 positions. For instance, if the row has 8s in positions >=4, then shift left. If they are in positions <=4, shift right. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to create a mirror image of the 8s across the vertical axis of the row. For example, the vertical axis is position4. So each 8 at position x is mirrored to position8 -x. Let's check:\n\nExample0 row0 input: 8s at3 and5. 8-3=5, 8-5=3. So mirrored positions are5 and3, which are already present. So output would have the same, but the output has 8s at0 and2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the mirroring is around a different axis. For example, the entire row is reversed. Original row0: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0] reversed would be [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0], same as input. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at all the training examples, perhaps the transformation is adding 8s in the same row, but shifted by a certain amount that depends on the row. For example:\n\n- For the first row (row0), add 8s three positions to the left of each existing 8.\n- For row1, add 8s four positions to the left.\n- For row2, add 8s five positions to the left.\n\nThis works for Example0. But in Example1's row0, adding three to the left would give new positions0 and2, but the output has new 8s at6 and8, which are three to the right. So maybe the direction varies.\n\nWait, perhaps the shift is such that for row i, the shift amount is 3 + i. But direction depends on whether the shift is possible. For example:\n\nIn Example0 row0, shifting left by3 (3+0=3) gives new positions0 and2. Which is valid.\n\nIn Example1 row0, shifting right by3 (3+0=3). Original positions3 and5 shifted right by3 gives6 and8. Which matches the output.\n\nBut why the direction changes. Maybe the shift direction alternates between examples. But how to determine when to shift left or right.\n\nAlternatively, the shift direction is based on the row's parity. For example, even rows shift left, odd rows shift right. But Example0's row0 is even (0) and shifts left. Example1's row0 is even (0) but shifts right. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the shift direction is determined by the sum of the 8s positions. For example, if the sum is even, shift left; if odd, shift right. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the shift direction is to the left for Example0 and to the right for Example1, but what's the trigger?\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's output rows:\n\nRow0:8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0 \u2192 the new 8s are at0 and2. The original 8s are at3 and5. The new 8s are three positions left of the original.\n\nRow1:8,8,0,0,8,8,0,0,0 \u2192 new 8s at0 and1. Original 8s at4 and5. Four positions left.\n\nRow2:8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0 \u2192 new 8 at0. Original 8 at5. Five positions left.\n\nSo for row i (0,1,2), the shift is 3 + i positions to the left.\n\nFor row0: 3+0=3 \u2192 shift left by3.\n\nFor row1: 3+1=4 \u2192 shift left by4.\n\nFor row2:3+2=5 \u2192 shift left by5.\n\nThis works for Example0.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0 input:8s at3 and5. Shift left by3 gives0 and2. But output has new 8s at6 and8. So this doesn't fit. Unless in Example1, the shift is to the right.\n\nBut why? What's the difference between the examples?\n\nWait, looking at Example1's output for row0: the new 8s are at6 and8. The original positions are3 and5. Shifting right by3 positions:3+3=6,5+3=8. So shift right by3.\n\nRow1 input:8s at3,4,5. Shifting right by4 positions:3+4=7,4+4=8,5+4=9 (out of bounds). So new 8s at7 and8. But output row1 has new 8s at6,7,8. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the shift amount for Example1 is different. For example, row0 shift right by3, row1 shift right by4, row2 shift right by5.\n\nBut then in Example1's row1 input:8s at3,4,5. Shift right by4 positions:3+4=7,4+4=8,5+4=9. So 7 and8. But output row1 adds 8s at6,7,8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. Let's look at the Test Input and see if applying the same pattern as Example0's shift would work.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo the upper three rows have 8s. Let's apply the same pattern as Example0:\n\nFor each row i (0,1,2), shift left by (3 + i) positions.\n\nRow0: 3+0=3. Original 8s at3 and5. Shift left by3 \u2192 new positions0 and2. So row0 becomes [8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0].\n\nRow1:3+1=4. Original 8s at4 and5. Shift left by4 \u2192 new positions0 and1. So row1 becomes [8,8,0,0,8,8,0,0,0].\n\nRow2:3+2=5. Original 8 at3. Shift left by5 \u2192 3-5= -2. Since position can't be negative, perhaps this is wrapped or not applied. But in Example0's row2, the 8 was at5. Shift left by5 \u2192 0. So here, original 8 is at3, shift left by5 \u21923-5= -2. Which is invalid. So perhaps this row doesn't get any new 8s. But in Example0's row2, the output added an 8 at0. So maybe for the Test Input's row2, the shift left by5 would result in 3-5= -2, but since it's invalid, perhaps we ignore it. But that would mean row2 output remains the same, which is [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. But according to Example0's pattern, even if the shift results in a negative position, it would add 8 at0. Like in Example0's row2, original 8 at5, shifted left by5 \u21920. So perhaps any shift that goes past position0 results in adding at position0.\n\nSo for Test Input row2: original 8 at3. Shift left by5 \u21923-5= -2. Since negative, wrap around to the end? Or add to position0. In Example0's row2, shift left by5 from5 gives0. So perhaps even if the shift is larger than the position, subtract until you reach a valid position.\n\nBut 3-5= -2. Adding 9 (length of the row) would be 7. But that's not matching any example. Alternatively, take the absolute value. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is modulo the row length. So 3-5= -2 \u2192 -2 +9=7. So new 8 at7. But that's not in the examples. So this approach seems off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when shifting left by a number greater than the position, the new position is0. So for Test Input row2, shifting left by5 from position3: new position is0. So output row2 becomes [8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. But looking at the training examples, this isn't matching any pattern. For example, in Example2's row2 input is [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0], output is [0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Which is shifting the 8 at3 to position2 (3-1=2), but that's different from the previous examples.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Perhaps there's a different pattern. Let's think of each row in the upper three as being transformed by placing 8s in positions (original position - (3 + row index)), but if that's negative, place them at the start.\n\nWait, for Test Input row0:\n\nrow0 index 0: shift left by3 (3+0). Original positions3 and5. 3-3=0,5-3=2. So new 8s at0 and2. So output row0 would be [8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0].\n\nrow1 index1: shift left by4. Original positions4 and5. 4-4=0,5-4=1. So new 8s at0 and1. Output row1: [8,8,0,0,8,8,0,0,0].\n\nrow2 index2: shift left by5. Original position3. 3-5=-2. But how to handle negative. Maybe take the absolute value or wrap around. If we take the absolute value and mod 9, 3-5= -2 \u2192 7. But adding 8 at7 would make the output row2: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0]. But looking at the training examples, in Example0's row2, the 8 was at position0 when shifted. So maybe for negative shifts, we add to position0. So 3-5= -2 \u2192 add at0. So row2 becomes [8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. But looking at Example2's output row0, which had a similar case: input row0 had 8 at3, output added 8 at2. So maybe the shift is different. This is really confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift amount is not fixed. Maybe for each 8 in the row, we add an 8 two positions to the left and one position to the right. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look for a pattern in the number of 8s added. In Example0's row0, two 8s added. In row1, two added. In row2, one added. Example1's row0 adds two, row1 adds three, row2 adds two. Not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by adding 8s in the upper half such that each row's 8s form a certain shape. For example, in Example0's upper rows, the 8s form a sort of arrow pointing left. In Example1's upper rows, they form a shape pointing right. So maybe the direction depends on the arrangement of the original 8s.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each row in the upper three, each existing 8 is replaced with a pair of 8s shifted left and right by the row index +1 or something. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that time is limited, and I need to provide an answer, I'll go with the initial hypothesis from Example0: for each row i in the upper three, shift each 8 left by (3 + i) positions. Let's apply this to the Test Input.\n\nTest Input's upper three rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0]. Shift left by3. 3-3=0,5-3=2. So new 8s at0 and2. Output row0: [8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0].\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0]. Shift left by4. 4-4=0,5-4=1. New 8s at0 and1. Output row1: [8,8,0,0,8,8,0,0,0].\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Shift left by5. 8 at position3. 3-5= -2 \u2192 which is invalid. Maybe it wraps around or is ignored. But in Example0's row2, the 8 was at5, shifted left by5 to 0. So here, 3-5= -2. Maybe it's treated as 9 -2 =7 (since 9 is the length of the row). So adding 8 at position7. But in Example0's row2, the 8 was added at0. Alternatively, perhaps for negative shifts, add at position0. So for row2, the 8 is added at0. So output row2: [8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut looking at Example2's input, when there's an 8 at3 in row0, the output added 8 at2. Which would be a shift of -1. So this contradicts.\n\nGiven the confusion, but based on Example0's pattern, the Test Input's output would have:\n\nRow0: [8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [8,8,0,0,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut in Example2's row0 input (which is similar to Test Input's row2), the output added 8 at position2. So perhaps for row2 in Test Input, the shift is 3+2=5, but the original position is3. 3-5= -2. If we use modulo 9, -2 mod9=7. So add 8 at7. But in Example0's row2, the shift of5 from5 gives0. So maybe when the shift is larger than the position, it wraps around to the end. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when the shift results in a negative position, we add the 8 at position0. So Test Input's row2 becomes [8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut looking back at the examples:\n\nExample2's input row0: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 output [0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. So the shift here seems to be -1 (3-1=2). Which doesn't fit the previous pattern. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAt this point, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial pattern for the Test Input as per Example0's approach, assuming that each upper row's 8s are shifted left by (3 + row index) positions. Applying this:\n\nTest Input rows:\n\nRow0: shift left by3 \u2192 new 8s at0 and2.\n\nRow1: shift left by4 \u2192 new 8s at0 and1.\n\nRow2: shift left by5 \u2192 new 8 at0 (since 3-5=-2 \u2192 assume0).\n\nThus, the Test Output would be:\n\n[8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0]\n\n[8,8,0,0,8,8,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe lower three rows remain unchanged. But looking at the training examples, the lower rows are unchanged. So the final answer would be this.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input and output matrices. Each example has 6 rows, each row is a list of numbers. The outputs seem to modify some of the input numbers. Let's look at the first example.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first three rows have 8s and 0s. The output changes some 0s to 8s. For instance, the first row input is [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0], and the output becomes [8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0]. So the first three elements: first and third positions become 8. Then in the second row, input is [0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0], output becomes [8,8,0,0,8,8,0,0,0]. Here, the first two positions are now 8. Third row input [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0] becomes [8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0], so first position is 8. Then the next three rows (4, 5, 6) remain the same. \n\nWait, so maybe the transformation is only applied to the first three rows, and specifically where there are 8s in the original? Let's check the other examples. \n\nIn Example 1's input, the first three rows have 8s again. The output for the first row changes the 6th and 8th positions to 8 (original was [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0] and output becomes [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8], so positions 6 and 8 are now 8. Wait, that's different from example 0. Hmm, maybe there's another pattern. \n\nLooking at the position of the existing 8s. In example 0's input first row, the 8s are at positions 3 and 5 (0-indexed). The output adds 8s at positions 0 and 2. Maybe they're mirroring around the central column? Let's see: the original 8s are at 3 and 5. The central column is position 4. So mirroring would mean, for each 8 in position i, add an 8 at position 8 - i (since the length is 9, indices 0-8). For example, position 3's mirror is 8-3=5, which is already there. Position 5's mirror is 3. But in the output of example 0's first row, the 8s are at 0,2,3,5. Hmm, maybe not exactly mirroring. \n\nAlternatively, maybe for each 8 in a row, we add 8s symmetrically in certain positions. Let's look at the first example again. The first row input has 8s at positions 3 and 5. Output adds 8s at 0 and 2. So 0 and 2 are symmetric around the center (position 4). 0 is 4 positions left of center, 2 is 2 positions left. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the number of 8s in the row determines how many to add. First row has two 8s, output adds two more. But the second row in example 0's input has two 8s (positions 4 and 5), output adds two at positions 0 and 1. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is to look at the first three rows and the positions of 8s, then \"reflect\" or expand them in some way. For example, in example 0, the first row's 8s are at columns 3 and 5. The output adds 8s at 0 and 2. Wait, 3-3=0, 5-3=2? Maybe that's a stretch. Or perhaps each 8 is causing a certain pattern. Like, for each 8 in the row, we add 8s to the left or right in specific positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a shift happening. Looking at example 0's first row input: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0]. Output becomes [8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0]. The new 8s are at positions 0 and 2. If the original 8s are at 3 and 5, perhaps subtracting 3 from their positions gives 0 and 2. But that seems arbitrary. \n\nWait, let's look at example 1. The input's first row is [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0], output becomes [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8]. The new 8s are at positions 6 and 8. Original 8s at 3 and 5. So 3 + 3 =6, 5 +3=8. That's adding 3. So maybe for each 8 in the original, we add another 8 three positions to the right. But in example 0's first row, original 8s at 3 and 5. Adding 3 would take them to 6 and 8. But in the output, the new 8s are at 0 and 2. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a vertical reflection. For example, in example 0's first row input: the original 8s are at 3 and 5. The output adds 8s at 0 and 2. If the row is mirrored, then position 3 would stay, position 5 would mirror to 3 (since 8-5=3). But that doesn't explain the new positions. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are copied from the right side to the left. For example, the original 8s are on the right half (positions 3 and 5), and the output mirrors them to the left. So 3 mirrored is 5 (8-3=5?), but that's not matching. Wait, perhaps each 8 in the right half (positions 4-8) is mirrored to the left. For example, position 5 (right side) would mirror to position 3 (8-5=3?), but that's already present. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input's first three rows are being expanded into a diamond or cross shape. For example, in example 0, first row input has 8s at 3 and 5. The output adds 8s at 0 and 2. Maybe each 8 creates a pattern around it. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at all the examples, the 4s in the lower three rows are not changed. So the transformation is only applied to the upper three rows (rows 0,1,2), and only to 8s, not 4s. So focusing on rows 0-2 where 8s are present.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compare input and output for each example. For example 0:\n\nInput row 0: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0]\nOutput row 0: [8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nThe added 8s are at positions 0 and 2. Original 8s at 3 and 5. So 0 and 2 are two positions left of 3 and 5. Wait, 3-3=0, 5-3=2. So subtracting 3. But why 3?\n\nLooking at example 1's input row 0: same as example 0's input row 0. But the output is different. So perhaps the transformation depends on the other rows. Wait, example 1's output row 0 is [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8]. So added 8s at positions 6 and 8. Original 8s at 3 and5. 3+3=6, 5+3=8. So adding 3. But why in one example it's subtracting 3, in another adding?\n\nThis seems inconsistent. So perhaps the pattern is not directly related to the positions of the 8s but something else.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is to take the existing 8s in a row and create new 8s in positions that form a certain pattern. For example, in example 0's first row, the original 8s are at 3 and5. The output adds 0 and2. So perhaps the leftmost 8 (position3) is causing new 8s to the left. Let's see: position3-3=0, position3-1=2. Hmm, maybe that's not a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s in the row. For example, in example 0's first row input has 2 8s, output has 4. Example1's first row input has 2 8s, output has 4. Example2's first row input has 1 8 (position3), output adds 8 at position2. So maybe the number of added 8s depends on the existing ones. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at example2's input first row [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0] becomes [0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. So 8 added at position2. Original 8 at3. So 3-1=2. Maybe each 8 is causing an 8 to the left by one? But in example0's first row, original 8s at3 and5. If we subtract 1, positions2 and4. But the output added 0 and2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at rows in the upper three, perhaps each row is being shifted in some way. For example, the first row of example0's input is shifted left by 3 positions? Let's see. Original 8s at3 and5. Shifting left by3 would put them at0 and2. Which matches the output. That makes sense. Wait, that's a possible pattern. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn example0's input row0: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0]. Shifting left by3 positions would result in [8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the output is [8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0]. So no, that's not a simple shift.\n\nAlternatively, rotating or shifting certain elements. Maybe the 8s are being copied to the left by a certain number of positions. For example, in example0's first row, the 8s at3 and5 are copied to positions0 and2 (left by3 and3 positions). But why 3? Because 3 is the original position's index? Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the transformation is to create a symmetrical pattern around the center column (index4). For each 8 in the upper half (rows 0-2), mirror it to the opposite side relative to the center. For example, in example0's first row input, 8s at3 and5. The center is4. The mirror of3 is5 (since4 -3=1, 4 +1=5). So those are already mirrored. But the output adds 8s at0 and2. The mirror of0 is8 (4 -0=4; 4 +4=8?), but that's not how it works. Alternatively, the left side is mirrored to the right. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each 8 in the upper three rows, we also add an 8 three positions to the left. Let's check:\n\nExample0's first row input has 8 at3: 3-3=0 \u2192 add 8 at0. 8 at5:5-3=2 \u2192 add8 at2. So output has 8s at0,2,3,5. That matches.\n\nExample1's first row input has 8s at3 and5. 3-3=0, 5-3=2. But output adds 8s at6 and8. Wait, that's the opposite. So 3+3=6, 5+3=8. So in example1, it's adding 3 to the right.\n\nHmm, this is conflicting. So maybe the direction depends on some condition.\n\nWait, looking at example1's input, the third row of the input (which is row3) has 4 in position5. But in example0's input, the fourth row (row3) has 4 in position3. So maybe the presence of 4s in lower rows affects how the 8s are transformed in the upper rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in example0, the 8s in upper rows are shifted left by3, but in example1 they are shifted right by3. But why? What's the difference between the examples?\n\nAlternatively, the direction is determined by the row number. For example, row0 is shifted left, row1 is shifted left by a different amount, etc. Let's check:\n\nIn example0:\n\nRow0 input: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0] \u2192 output [8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0]. Added 8s at0 and2. Which would be left by3 positions from 3 and5.\n\nRow1 input: [0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0] \u2192 output [8,8,0,0,8,8,0,0,0]. Added 8s at0 and1. Original 8s at4 and5. 4-4=0,5-4=1. So shifted left by4?\n\nRow2 input: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0] \u2192 output [8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]. Added 8 at0. Original 8 at5. 5-5=0. Shifted left by5? This seems inconsistent.\n\nHmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at example1's output row0: [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8]. The added 8s are at6 and8. Original 8s at3 and5. So 3+3=6,5+3=8. So shifted right by3. But why in example0 it's left shift, here right shift. What's different between the examples?\n\nLooking at the lower rows. In example0's input, the lower three rows (3-5) have 4s. The output leaves them unchanged. In example1's input, row3 has a 4 at position5. Output for upper rows may depend on the lower rows. Maybe the position of the 4s in the lower rows determines the direction of the shift for the 8s. \n\nFor instance, if in row3 (the first row of the lower three) the first occurrence of 4 is at position3 (like in example0), then shift left by3. If the first occurrence is at position5 (example1), shift right by3. Let's check:\n\nIn example0, row3 of input has 4 at position3. So shift left by3 \u2192 matches example0's output for upper rows.\n\nIn example1, row3 of input has 4 at position5. So shift right by3 \u2192 original 8s at3 and5 become 6 and8. Which matches example1's output.\n\nIn example2, row3 has 4 at position3 (input row3 is [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]). So shift left by3. Original 8 in row0 is at3. 3-3=0, but output adds 8 at position2. Wait, not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait example2's input first row is [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. The output first row is [0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. So added 8 at position2. Original 8 at3. So 3-1=2. So shift left by1. But why? Because row3's 4 is at3. Hmm, maybe the shift amount is related to the column of the 4 in row3. For example, if the first 4 in row3 is at column x, then shift by x. \n\nIn example0, row3's first 4 is at3 \u2192 shift left by3. Which works for row0's example0.\n\nIn example1, row3's first 4 is at5 \u2192 shift right by5? Original 8 at3 \u2192 3+5=8 (position8). But in example1's output row0, 8 is added at6 and8. Original 8s at3 and5. 3+5=8, 5+5=10 (which is beyond the array length). So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the shift amount is the column index of the 4 in row3. For example0's row3 has 4 at column3 \u2192 shift left by3. Example1's row3 has 4 at column5 \u2192 shift right by5. But in example1's output, the added 8s are at6 and8, which would be 3+5=8 (but 3+5=8, but the original 8 at3 is shifted to8. 5+5=10, which is beyond the 9 elements. So that's not possible. So maybe shift by (9-5) for example1? 4, but 5+4=9 which is out of bounds.\n\nHmm, this seems not working.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for patterns in the outputs. \n\nIn example0's output, upper three rows have 8s added in the first three columns. In example1's output, the added 8s are in the last three columns. So maybe the direction depends on the presence of 4s in the lower rows. Like, if the 4s are in the left part (columns 0-4), the 8s are shifted left; if 4s are in the right part (columns 5-8), shifted right.\n\nIn example0, row3's 4 is at3 (left part), so upper rows shifted left. Example1's row3's 4 is at5 (right part), so shifted right. Example2's row3's 4 is at3 (left part), so shifted left. Let's check:\n\nExample0's row0 input: 8s at3 and5. Shift left by 3 (because row3's 4 is at3). So 3-3=0, 5-3=2. Output adds 0 and2 \u2192 matches.\n\nExample1's row0 input: 8s at3 and5. Shift right by (9 -5) =4? Or 5-4=1 (since center is4). 3+ (5-4)=4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the first 4 in row3 is at column x, then for the upper rows, each 8 is mirrored around x. For example, if x=3, then mirror each 8's position around 3. Original 8 at3 \u2192 same. 8 at5: mirrored around3 would be 1 (3 - (5-3) =1). But in example0's output, there's 8 at0 and2, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the shift amount is x, where x is the column of the first 4 in row3. So example0: x=3. So shift left by3. Example1: x=5 \u2192 shift right by5. But shifting right by5 from position3 gives 8 (3+5=8), which is the case in example1's first row output (added 8 at6 and8). Wait:\n\nOriginal 8s in example1's row0:3 and5.\n\nShift right by5: 3+5=8, 5+5=10 (invalid). But output added at6 and8. Hmm, maybe shift by (x - current column). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the distance between the 4 in row3 and the center (column4). For example, example0's row3's 4 is at3 \u2192 distance 1 left. So shift left by 1. But in example0's row0, the shift was 3 positions left. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the positions of the 4s in row3. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe another angle: look at the test input and see if applying the same pattern as the examples would work.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking at row3, the first 4 is at position5 (since row3 is [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]). So column5. According to example1's case where the 4 is at5, the shift is to the right by3. Because in example1's output, the added 8s were 3 positions to the right. So for each 8 in the upper rows, add 3 to their positions.\n\nSo let's apply that to the test input's upper three rows:\n\nFirst row input: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0] \u2192 original 8s at3 and5. Adding 3 gives6 and8. So new 8s at6 and8. So the first row output would be [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8].\n\nSecond row input: [0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0] \u2192 original 8s at4 and5. Adding3 gives7 and8. So new 8s at7 and8. So second row becomes [0,0,0,0,8,8,0,8,8].\n\nThird row input: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 original 8 at3. Adding3 gives6. So new 8 at6. So third row becomes [0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0].\n\nWait, but looking at example1's first row, the output was [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8], which matches adding 3 to the original 8s. And the second row in example1's input was [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0], output [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8], which seems like adding 3 to each 8's position. Original positions3,4,5. Adding3 gives6,7,8. So new 8s at6,7,8. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: in the upper three rows, for each 8 in the input, we add an 8 three positions to the right (original position +3). But this depends on the position of the first 4 in row3. If the first 4 in row3 is at position3 (example0), then shift left by3. If it's at5 (example1), shift right by3. \n\nSo in the test input, row3's first 4 is at position5. Therefore, shift right by3. So each 8 in upper three rows is copied to position+3.\n\nLet's test this with the test input:\n\nTest input first row: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0]. 8s at3 and5. Shift right by3: 3+3=6,5+3=8. So new 8s at6 and8. So first row becomes [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8].\n\nSecond row: [0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0]. 8s at4 and5. 4+3=7,5+3=8. So new 8s at7 and8. So second row becomes [0,0,0,0,8,8,0,8,8].\n\nThird row: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. 8 at3. 3+3=6. So new 8 at6. Third row becomes [0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0].\n\nLower three rows (4-5) remain the same.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8]\n[0,0,0,0,8,8,0,8,8]\n[0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, for example1, when the shift is to the right, the original 8s stay. So in example1's first row input, the 8s are at3 and5. The output has 8s at3,5,6,8. So original positions plus new ones. Similarly, test input's first row would have 8s at3,5,6,8. But according to our previous step, the first row would be [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8]. So yes, 3,5,6,8.\n\nBut let's check example1's row0 input and output. Input: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0]. Output: [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8]. So original 8s are retained, new ones added at6 and8. So it's not shifting but adding. So the pattern is to add 8s three positions to the right of each existing 8, but only in the upper three rows, and when row3's first 4 is at position5. \n\nSimilarly, when the first 4 in row3 is at3, as in example0, then the upper rows have 8s added three positions to the left. So for example0's first row, 8s at3 and5, add 8s at0 and2 (3-3=0,5-3=2).\n\nSo the rule is: For the upper three rows (0-2), for each 8 in the row, add another 8 either to the left or right by three positions, depending on the position of the first 4 in row3. If the first 4 in row3 is in column x, then the shift direction is determined by x. For example, x <=4 \u2192 shift left; x >=5 \u2192 shift right. Or maybe the exact position x determines the shift amount. \n\nIn example0, row3's first 4 is at3. So shift left by3. Example1's row3's 4 is at5, shift right by3. Example2's row3's 4 is at3, shift left by3. Test input's row3's 4 is at5, shift right by3.\n\nTherefore, the pattern is: in the upper three rows, each 8 is duplicated three positions to the left if the first 4 in row3 is in columns 0-4, and three positions to the right if it's in columns5-8. \n\nSo applying this to the test input, since the first 4 in row3 is at5, which is in the right half, we add 8s three positions to the right of each existing 8 in upper rows. \n\nTherefore, the test input's output should be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,8,8,0,8,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nLower three rows remain the same.\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
