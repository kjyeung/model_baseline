        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a grid with zeros and some 5s arranged in blocks. The outputs have numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 inserted around those 5 blocks. \n\nLet's start with Example 0. The input has a 2x2 block of 5s in the middle. The output adds 1, 0, 0, 2 in the third row above the 5s, and 3, 0, 0, 4 in the fifth row below. So maybe the numbers 1,2 are placed above the 5 block and 3,4 below? Let me check the positions. In the input, the 5s are at rows 3 and 4 (if we start counting from 0), columns 4 and 5. The output has 1 and 2 in row 2, columns 3 and 6. Wait, the 5s start at column 4, so 3 is one left, and 6 is one right. Then in the row below, row 5, columns 3 and 6 again for 3 and 4. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's about surrounding each 2x2 block of 5s with numbers 1,2,3,4 in a specific pattern. Let's see another example. Example 1's input has two 5 blocks. The first is in rows 2 and 3, columns 2 and 3. The output places 1 and 2 in row 1 (above) at columns 1 and 4, and 3 and 4 in row 4 (below) at columns 1 and 4. Then there's another 5 block in rows 6 and 7, columns 6 and 7. The output has 1,2 in row 5, columns 5 and 8, and 3,4 in row 8, columns 5 and 8. So the pattern seems to be that for each 2x2 block of 5s, we place 1 and 2 one row above, one column to the left and right of the block's left and right edges, and 3 and 4 one row below, same columns. Wait, maybe. Let's confirm.\n\nIn Example 0, the 5 block is centered. The 1 and 2 are placed one row up, left and right. For columns: the 5s are columns 4-5. So left is column 3, right is column 6. Then 1 is at column 3, 2 at 6. Similarly, 3 and 4 are in the row below (row 5), same columns. That fits. Example 1's first block: columns 2-3. So left is 1 (column 1?), right is 4 (column 4). So 1 at column 1, 2 at column 4. Then 3 and 4 are in the row below (row 4) same columns. That matches. So the pattern is for each 2x2 block of 5s, insert 1 and 2 in the row above, to the left and right of the block, and 3 and 4 in the row below, same positions.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, the output has some overlapping numbers. Let's look. For instance, the third row (0-based?) in the input has a 5 block at columns 3-4. In the output, row 2 (assuming rows start at 0), there's 1 and 2 at columns 2 and 5. Then in row 3, there's a 1 and 2 at columns 7 and 10. Wait, maybe each 5 block is being processed, and each time, the surrounding numbers are placed. So each 5 block is surrounded by 1,2 above and 3,4 below. But in Example 2, there are multiple blocks, so each gets their own set of numbers. But how are the numbers ordered? Like 1,2,3,4 for each block, but the numbers increment globally. Wait, in Example 0, the output has 1,2,3,4. In Example 1, the output has 1,2,3,4 for the first block and then another 1,2,3,4 for the second block. Wait, looking at Example 1's output:\n\nFirst block in rows 2-3, columns 2-3. The output rows 1 and 4 have 1,2 and 3,4. Then the second block is in rows 6-7, columns 6-7. The output rows 5 and 8 have 1,2 and 3,4 again. Wait, but in the output of Example 1, the first occurrence is 1,2 in row 1 (columns 1 and 4), then 3,4 in row 4. Then in row 5, columns 5 and 8 (which is the row above the next block) there's 1,2 again. So the numbers are reused per block. But how? Because in Example 2's output, there are multiple 1,2,3,4 numbers. Like in row 1, columns 2 and 5 (1,2), then row 3, columns 7 and 10 (another 1,2), and so on. So the numbers 1,2,3,4 are placed for each 5 block, but each block's set is independent. But the numbers are placed in order, so maybe for each block, the numbers are 1,2,3,4, but the numbering continues. Wait, but in Example 0, the output has only 1,2,3,4. In Example 1, the first block has 1,2,3,4, then the next block has 1,2,3,4 again. So perhaps each 5 block is replaced with these numbers, but the numbers are reset for each block. But wait, in Example 1's output, the first block's numbers are 1,2,3,4, and the second block's numbers are again 1,2,3,4. But in the output given for Example 1, the second block's numbers are in row 5 (1,2) and row 8 (3,4). So the numbers are 1,2,3,4 for each block. However, looking at Example 2, the numbers are 1,2,3,4, then again 1,2,3,4 for another block. So each block gets its own set of 1,2,3,4. Wait, but the output in Example 2 shows numbers like 1,2, then 3,4, then 1 again. So maybe the numbers are per block and each block's numbers start at 1 again. So each 2x2 block of 5s is surrounded by 1,2 above and 3,4 below, regardless of other blocks. So the numbers are not unique across the entire grid but per block.\n\nNow, the test input has multiple 5 blocks. Let's list them:\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow 1 and 2 (0-based?) have 5s in columns 1-2 and 11-12 (since the test input is 15 columns). So two 2x2 blocks here. Then rows 4 and 5 have 5s in columns 5-6. Then rows 6 and 7 have 5s in columns 12-13. Then rows 10 and 11 have 5s in columns 2-3 and 9-10 (row 11 has columns 9-10 as 5s, but row 10 has 5s in columns 2-3). Wait, row 10: [0, 0, 5,5,0...], so columns 2-3. Row 11: [0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0]. Wait, columns 9-10 are 5s in row 11. So that's another 2x2 block. Then rows 11 and 12 have 5s in columns 9-10 (row 12 has 5s there? Wait, row 12 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0]. So rows 11 and 12 have 5s in columns 9-10. So that's another 2x2 block.\n\nSo total blocks:\n\n1. Rows 1-2, columns 1-2 (5s)\n2. Rows 1-2, columns 11-12 (5s)\nWait, looking at the test input:\n\nRow 1: [0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]\nSo columns 1-2 and 11-12 in rows 1-2. So two separate 2x2 blocks here. Then rows 4-5, columns 5-6. Then rows 6-7, columns 12-13. Then rows 10-11, columns 2-3 (but row 10 has 5s in columns 2-3, and row 11 has 5s in columns 2-3 as well? Wait, row 10: [0,0,5,5,0,...], so columns 2-3. Row 11: [0,0,5,5,0,...], yes. So that's a 2x2 block. Then rows 11-12, columns 9-10 (row 11 has 5s in columns 9-10, row 12 also in 9-10). So that's another block. Wait, but rows 11 and 12? So row indexes start at 0, so row 10 and 11 would be the next block? Let me check again:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: 5s in 1-2 and 11-12.\n\nRow 2: same as row 1.\n\nRow 3: zeros.\n\nRow 4: 5s in 5-6.\n\nRow 5: same as 4.\n\nRow 6: 5s in 12-13.\n\nRow 7: same as 6.\n\nRow 8: zeros.\n\nRow 9: zeros.\n\nRow 10: 5s in 2-3.\n\nRow 11: 5s in 2-3 and 9-10.\n\nRow 12: 5s in 9-10.\n\nRow 13: zeros.\n\nRow 14: zeros.\n\nSo the blocks are:\n\n1. Rows 1-2, columns 1-2.\n\n2. Rows 1-2, columns 11-12.\n\n3. Rows 4-5, columns 5-6.\n\n4. Rows 6-7, columns 12-13.\n\n5. Rows 10-11, columns 2-3.\n\n6. Rows 11-12, columns 9-10.\n\nWait, but some of these might overlap. For example, row 11 is part of two blocks: columns 2-3 and 9-10. Each 2x2 block is identified as contiguous 5s.\n\nNow, for each of these blocks, we need to add 1,2 above and 3,4 below.\n\nSo for block 1 (rows 1-2, columns 1-2):\n\nThe row above is row 0. The columns left and right would be columns 0 and 3. So place 1 at row 0, column 0, and 2 at row 0, column 3. Then below (row 3), place 3 at column 0 and 4 at column 3. Wait, but in example 0, the block is in rows 3-4, and the 1,2 are in row 2 (above), and 3,4 in row 5 (below). So the row above is the row before the block's top row, and the row below is the row after the block's bottom row.\n\nSo for a block in rows r and r+1 (since 2x2), the row above is r-1, and the row below is r+2.\n\nSimilarly, columns: for columns c and c+1, left column is c-1, right is c+2.\n\nSo for each 2x2 block of 5s starting at (r, c), the 1 is placed at (r-1, c-1), 2 at (r-1, c+2), 3 at (r+2, c-1), and 4 at (r+2, c+2).\n\nWait, let's check example 0. The 5 block is in rows 3 and 4 (assuming 0-based), columns 4 and 5. So r=3, c=4. Then 1 is at (2,3), 2 at (2,6). Then 3 is at (5,3), 4 at (5,6). Which matches the output. So yes, that's the pattern.\n\nIn example 1, the first block is rows 2-3, columns 2-3. So r=2, c=2. So 1 at (1,1), 2 at (1,4), 3 at (4,1), 4 at (4,4). Which matches the output.\n\nSo the rule is: for each 2x2 block of 5s starting at (r,c), insert 1 at (r-1, c-1), 2 at (r-1, c+2), 3 at (r+2, c-1), 4 at (r+2, c+2). And if those positions are within the grid, replace 0s with these numbers. Now, overlapping may occur if two blocks are close, but according to the examples, each block's numbers are added regardless of others.\n\nSo for the test input, we need to identify all 2x2 blocks of 5s and apply this pattern.\n\nLet's list all the 2x2 blocks in the test input:\n\n1. Rows 1-2, columns 1-2 (since rows 1 and 2 have 5s in columns 1 and 2).\n\n2. Rows 1-2, columns 11-12 (columns 11 and 12 have 5s in rows 1 and 2).\n\n3. Rows 4-5, columns 5-6 (rows 4 and 5 have 5s in columns 5 and 6).\n\n4. Rows 6-7, columns 12-13 (rows 6 and 7 have 5s in columns 12 and 13).\n\n5. Rows 10-11, columns 2-3 (rows 10 and 11 have 5s in columns 2 and 3).\n\n6. Rows 11-12, columns 9-10 (rows 11 and 12 have 5s in columns 9 and 10).\n\nWait, row 10 has 5s in columns 2-3, and row 11 has 5s there as well, so that's a 2x2 block. Then row 11 has 5s in columns 9-10, and row 12 also. So that's another block.\n\nNow, applying the pattern for each block.\n\nLet's process each block one by one.\n\nBlock 1: rows 1-2 (r=1), columns 1-2 (c=1).\n\nSo 1 at (0, 0), 2 at (0,3).\n\n3 at (3,0), 4 at (3,3).\n\nCheck if these positions exist. The grid is 15x15 (rows 0-14, columns 0-14). All positions exist.\n\nBlock 2: rows 1-2 (r=1), columns 11-12 (c=11).\n\n1 at (0,10), 2 at (0,13).\n\n3 at (3,10), 4 at (3,13).\n\nBlock 3: rows 4-5 (r=4), columns 5-6 (c=5).\n\n1 at (3,4), 2 at (3,7).\n\n3 at (6,4), 4 at (6,7).\n\nBlock 4: rows 6-7 (r=6), columns 12-13 (c=12).\n\n1 at (5,11), 2 at (5,14) (but columns go up to 14, so 14 is valid).\n\n3 at (8,11), 4 at (8,14).\n\nBlock 5: rows 10-11 (r=10), columns 2-3 (c=2).\n\n1 at (9,1), 2 at (9,4).\n\n3 at (12,1), 4 at (12,4).\n\nBlock 6: rows 11-12 (r=11), columns 9-10 (c=9).\n\n1 at (10,8), 2 at (10,11).\n\n3 at (13,8), 4 at (13,11).\n\nNow, inserting these into the grid. Also, need to check if any overlapping occurs. For example, if two blocks insert into the same cell, which number takes precedence? Looking at the training examples, in Example 1, the second block's 1,2 are in row 5, columns 5 and 8. But there's no conflict. In Example 2, some cells have multiple numbers, but the examples show that each block's numbers are added even if they overlap. For example, in Example 2's output, row 3 has 1 and 2 in columns 7 and 10, which might be from a different block. So overlapping numbers are allowed. So all numbers are placed, even if they overwrite previous zeros. However, in the training examples, the numbers 1,2,3,4 are placed even if there are existing numbers, but the original input's non-5 cells are all zeros. So in the output, the 5s remain, and the numbers are placed in zeros. Therefore, in the test input, wherever the 1,2,3,4 are placed, they replace the 0s, but 5s are left untouched.\n\nSo applying all these positions:\n\nLet's go step by step.\n\nStarting with the test input grid, which is 15 rows (0-14) and 15 columns (0-14).\n\nFirst, for Block 1 (rows 1-2, columns 1-2):\n\nInsert 1 at (0,0), 2 at (0,3).\n\nInsert 3 at (3,0), 4 at (3,3).\n\nSo row 0: columns 0 and 3 become 1 and 2.\n\nRow 3: columns 0 and 3 become 3 and 4.\n\nBlock 2 (rows 1-2, columns 11-12):\n\nInsert 1 at (0,10), 2 at (0,13).\n\nInsert 3 at (3,10), 4 at (3,13).\n\nRow 0: columns 10 and 13 become 1 and 2.\n\nRow 3: columns 10 and 13 become 3 and 4.\n\nBlock 3 (rows 4-5, columns 5-6):\n\nInsert 1 at (3,4), 2 at (3,7).\n\nInsert 3 at (6,4), 4 at (6,7).\n\nRow 3: columns 4 and 7 become 1 and 2.\n\nRow 6: columns 4 and 7 become 3 and 4.\n\nBlock 4 (rows 6-7, columns 12-13):\n\nInsert 1 at (5,11), 2 at (5,14).\n\nInsert 3 at (8,11), 4 at (8,14).\n\nRow 5: columns 11 and 14 become 1 and 2.\n\nRow 8: columns 11 and 14 become 3 and 4.\n\nBlock 5 (rows 10-11, columns 2-3):\n\nInsert 1 at (9,1), 2 at (9,4).\n\nInsert 3 at (12,1), 4 at (12,4).\n\nRow 9: columns 1 and 4 become 1 and 2.\n\nRow 12: columns 1 and 4 become 3 and 4.\n\nBlock 6 (rows 11-12, columns 9-10):\n\nInsert 1 at (10,8), 2 at (10,11).\n\nInsert 3 at (13,8), 4 at (13,11).\n\nRow 10: columns 8 and 11 become 1 and 2.\n\nRow 13: columns 8 and 11 become 3 and 4.\n\nNow, let's check if any of these positions already have non-zero values in the input. The test input's non-zero cells are the 5s. The positions we're inserting into are all 0s in the input, so they can be safely overwritten.\n\nSo compiling all these changes into the test input's grid:\n\nOriginal rows (0-14):\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nAfter Block 1 and 2:\n\nRow 0 becomes: [1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0]\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first block adds 1 at (0,0), 2 at (0,3). Block 2 adds 1 at (0,10), 2 at (0,13). So row 0:\n\nIndices 0: 1\n\n3: 2\n\n10: 1\n\n13: 2\n\nThe rest are 0. So row 0:\n\n[1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nRow 3: Original all zeros. After Block 1's 3 at (3,0), 4 at (3,3); Block 2's 3 at (3,10), 4 at (3,13).\n\nSo row 3 becomes:\n\n[3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nRow 5: Original has 5s in columns 5-6 (rows 4-5). Block 4's 1 at (5,11), 2 at (5,14).\n\nSo row 5 (original is [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]) becomes:\n\nColumns 11: 1, 14:2. So row 5:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\nRow 6: Original has 0s except columns 12-13. Block 3's 3 at (6,4), 4 at (6,7).\n\nSo row 6 (original [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0]) becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nRow 8: Original all zeros. Block 4's 3 at (8,11), 4 at (8,14).\n\nSo row 8:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4]\n\nRow 9: Original all zeros. Block 5's 1 at (9,1), 2 at (9,4).\n\nSo row 9:\n\n[0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 10: Original has 5s in columns 2-3. Block 6's 1 at (10,8), 2 at (10,11).\n\nSo row 10 (original [0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]) becomes:\n\n[0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow 12: Original has 5s in columns 9-10. Block 5's 3 at (12,1),4 at (12,4).\n\nSo row 12 (original [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0]) becomes:\n\n[0,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 13: Original all zeros. Block 6's 3 at (13,8),4 at (13,11).\n\nSo row 13:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,0,0,0]\n\nOther rows may remain as original except where modified.\n\nPutting all this together, the final output grid should have the 5s unchanged and the inserted numbers as per the pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples, and then apply that to the test input. Let's start by analyzing each training example closely.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nThe input has a 2x2 block of 5s in the middle (rows 3-4, columns 4-5). The output introduces numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 around that block. Specifically, in row 2 (third row from top) at columns 3 and 6, there are 1 and 2. Then in row 5 (sixth row) at columns 3 and 6, there are 3 and 4. So it looks like the 1 and 2 are above the block, and 3 and 4 are below. The positions are diagonally adjacent to the corners of the 5-block.\n\nWait, let me check the positions. The 5s are at (3,4) to (4,5) (assuming 0-based or 1-based indexing? The input is written as rows, each with 10 elements. Let's assume rows and columns are 0-indexed. So in Example 0's input, the 5s are in rows 3 and 4 (4th and 5th rows if 1-based), columns 4 and 5. The output in row 2 (third row) has 1 at column 3 and 2 at column 6. That's one row above the top of the 5-block. Similarly, row 5 (sixth row) has 3 and 4, which is one row below the bottom of the 5-block. The columns for 1 and 2 are one to the left and right of the 5-block's left and right edges. The 5-block starts at column 4 (left) and ends at column 5 (right). So 1 is at column 3 (left -1) and 2 at column 6 (right +1). Similarly, 3 is at column 3 (left -1) and 4 at column 6 (right +1) but in the row below.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each 2x2 block of 5s, we place numbers 1, 2 above the block (left and right of the block's top corners), and numbers 3, 4 below (left and right of the block's bottom corners). The numbers increase in sequence as we encounter more blocks. Wait, in Example 0, there's only one 5-block, so 1,2,3,4. In Example 1, there are two 5-blocks. Let's check that.\n\nExample 1's input has two 5-blocks. The first is in rows 2-3 (third and fourth rows), columns 2-3. The output has 1 and 2 in row 1, columns 1 and 4 (since the block's left is 2, so left-1 is 1, right+1 is 4). Then 3 and 4 are in row 4, columns 1 and 4. The second 5-block is in rows 6-7 (seventh and eighth rows), columns 6-7. In the output, for this block, the numbers are 1 and 2 in row 5, columns 5 and 8 (left-1=5, right+1=8?), but looking at the output, the numbers are in row 5, columns 5 (1) and 8 (2)? Wait, let's look at the output for Example 1. The output has in row 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0]. So that's columns 5 and 8 (if 0-indexed). Wait, the block is in columns 6-7. So left is 6, right is 7. Left-1 would be 5, right+1 would be 8. So the 1 and 2 are at columns 5 and 8. Then 3 and 4 would be below, in row 8, columns 5 and 8. Looking at the output's row 8: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0]. Yes, that's columns 5 and 8. So each 5-block adds its own set of 1,2 above and 3,4 below, and these numbers are sequential across all blocks. So in Example 1, the first block adds 1,2,3,4, then the next block starts with 1 again? Wait no. Let's look at the output of Example 1 again. The first block's 1,2 are in row 1, then the next block's 1,2 are in row 5. But the numbers are 1,2,3,4 for the first block, then 1,2,3,4 again for the second. Wait, but looking at the output, the numbers go up to 4 in the first part, then 1,2 again. Let me check:\n\nExample 1's output:\n\nRow 1 (second row) has [0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. So 1 and 2 here.\n\nRow 4 has [0,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]. So 3 and 4 here.\n\nThen in row 5, [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0]. Then row 8 has [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,0].\n\nSo for the first block (top), it's 1,2,3,4. Then for the second block (bottom), again 1,2,3,4. That suggests that each 2x2 5-block is surrounded by 1,2 above and 3,4 below, and each block's markers are independent. But wait, in the output, the numbers are not overlapping. So perhaps each block adds 1,2,3,4 in the order they appear. Or maybe the numbers are per block, but how do they increment? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are assigned in the order the blocks are encountered. For example, the first block (top) gets 1,2,3,4, the next block (bottom) gets 5,6,7,8, but in Example 1, the output for the second block uses 1 and 2 again. So that's not the case.\n\nWait in Example 1's output, the second block's markers are 1,2,3,4 again. So maybe each block has its own 1-4 numbers. But that's conflicting because in the output, the same numbers appear multiple times. But how does that fit with the example outputs?\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the numbers go up to 4 again, but more blocks. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 2's output, there are multiple 1,2,3,4 sets. For example, in row 1 (second row) columns 2 and 5: 1 and 2. Then row 3 (fourth row) columns 7 and 10 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's see the output of Example 2:\n\nRow 1 (0-based index 1) is [0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So columns 2 and 5 (0-based) have 1 and 2.\n\nThen row 3 (index 3) has [0,0,0,5,5,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. Here, columns 7 and 10 (if 0-based) have 1 and 2. Then in row 4 (index 4), columns 2 and 5 have 3 and 4. Row 6 (index 6) columns 7 and 10 have 3 and 4. So each 5-block's markers are 1,2 above and 3,4 below. The numbers are per block, and each block uses the same numbers, but perhaps the numbers are placed in such a way that they don't overlap. So the same numbers can appear multiple times in the grid as long as they are from different blocks.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for every 2x2 block of 5s, insert a 1 and 2 in the row above, one column left of the block's left edge and one column right of the block's right edge. Then insert 3 and 4 in the row below, same columns. The rest of the grid remains 0 except for existing 5s.\n\nLet me verify with Example 0. The 5s are in rows 3-4, columns 4-5. The row above is row 2. Left edge is column 4, so left-1 is 3. Right edge is column 5, right+1 is 6. So 1 at (2,3) and 2 at (2,6). Then row below is row 5. So 3 at (5,3) and 4 at (5,6). Which matches the output.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's first block (rows 2-3, columns 2-3). Row above is row 1. Left-1 is 1, right+1 is 4. So 1 at (1,1) and 2 at (1,4). Row below is row 4. So 3 at (4,1) and 4 at (4,4). The second block is in rows 6-7, columns 6-7. Row above is row 5. Left-1 is 5, right+1 is 8. So 1 at (5,5) and 2 at (5,8). Row below is row 8. So 3 at (8,5) and 4 at (8,8). Which matches the output.\n\nSo the rule is: for each 2x2 block of 5s, add 1 and 2 in the row above, left-1 and right+1 columns, and 3 and 4 in the row below, same columns.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nThe test input is a 15x15 grid. Let's look for all 2x2 blocks of 5s.\n\nLooking row by row:\n\nRow 1 (index 1): [0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]. So columns 1-2 (5s) and 11-12 (5s). But each of these is a 2x2 block? Wait, row 1 and row 2 (next row) both have 5s in columns 1-2 and 11-12. Wait, let's check:\n\nRow 1: columns 1 and 2 are 5,5.\n\nRow 2: columns 1 and 2 are 5,5. So this forms a 2x2 block starting at (1,1) to (2,2). So that's one block.\n\nAlso, in row 1, columns 11 and 12 are 5,5. Row 2, columns 11 and 12 are 5,5. So another 2x2 block at (1,11) to (2,12). Wait, but looking at row 2: [0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]. So columns 1-2 and 11-12. So two 2x2 blocks in rows 1-2, columns 1-2 and 11-12.\n\nWait, but row 2 is the same as row 1 here. So these are two separate 2x2 blocks. Each is 2x2.\n\nThen, in rows 4-5 (indices 4 and 5), columns 5-6: 5,5. Check row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Row 5: same as row4. So a 2x2 block at (4,5) to (5,6).\n\nNext, rows 6-7 (indices 6 and7), columns 12-13: 5,5. Let's check row6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0]. Row7: same. So a 2x2 block at (6,12) to (7,13).\n\nThen in rows 10-11 (indices 10 and11), columns 2-3: 5,5. Wait, row10: [0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Row11: [0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0]. Wait, row11 has 5s at columns 2-3 and 9-10. But row10's columns 2-3 are 5,5. So the block at (10,2) to (11,3) is a 2x2. Also, row11's columns 9-10 are 5,5. Row12 has columns 9-10 as 5,5. So another 2x2 block at (11,9) to (12,10).\n\nSo total blocks:\n\n1. Rows 1-2, columns 1-2.\n\n2. Rows 1-2, columns 11-12.\n\n3. Rows 4-5, columns 5-6.\n\n4. Rows 6-7, columns 12-13.\n\n5. Rows 10-11, columns 2-3.\n\n6. Rows 11-12, columns 9-10.\n\nEach of these 2x2 5-blocks will generate their own 1,2 above and 3,4 below.\n\nNow, let's process each block:\n\nBlock 1: rows 1-2, columns 1-2.\n\nAbove row: row0 (index 0) is the row above. Left-1 is column0. Right+1 is column3. So place 1 at (0,0) and 2 at (0,3). But check if those positions are within the grid. The grid is 0-14 rows and columns. So row0, column0 is valid. However, the test input's row0 is all zeros. So in the output, we need to place 1 and 2 here.\n\nThen below row is row3 (index3). Place 3 at (3,0) and 4 at (3,3).\n\nBlock 2: rows 1-2, columns 11-12.\n\nAbove row: row0. Left-1 is column10, right+1 is column13. So 1 at (0,10), 2 at (0,13). Below row: row3. 3 at (3,10), 4 at (3,13).\n\nBlock3: rows4-5, columns5-6.\n\nAbove row: row3 (index3). Left-1=4, right+1=7. So 1 at (3,4), 2 at (3,7). Below row: row6. 3 at (6,4), 4 at (6,7).\n\nBlock4: rows6-7, columns12-13.\n\nAbove row: row5. Left-1=11, right+1=14. So 1 at (5,11), 2 at (5,14). Below row: row8. 3 at (8,11), 4 at (8,14).\n\nBlock5: rows10-11, columns2-3.\n\nAbove row: row9. Left-1=1, right+1=4. So 1 at (9,1), 2 at (9,4). Below row: row12. 3 at (12,1), 4 at (12,4).\n\nBlock6: rows11-12, columns9-10.\n\nAbove row: row10. Left-1=8, right+1=11. So 1 at (10,8), 2 at (10,11). Below row: row13. 3 at (13,8), 4 at (13,11).\n\nNow, we need to insert these numbers into the test input's grid. The original 5s remain, and the 1,2,3,4 are placed accordingly.\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the numbers are placed even if there's another 5-block nearby. For example, in Example2, multiple blocks are processed, each adding their own 1-4 numbers. So overlapping numbers may occur, but in the output, they are placed as per each block's position.\n\nNow, let's construct the output step by step.\n\nStart with the test input grid. For each 5-block, add the 1,2 above and 3,4 below.\n\nFirst, process Block1 (rows1-2, cols1-2):\n\nRow0: place 1 at column0 and 2 at column3.\n\nRow3: place 3 at column0 and 4 at column3.\n\nBlock2 (rows1-2, cols11-12):\n\nRow0: place 1 at column10, 2 at column13.\n\nRow3: place 3 at column10, 4 at column13.\n\nBut row3 already has these positions from Block1's 3 and 4. Wait, in Block1's processing, row3's column0 and3 are 3 and4. Block2 adds 3 and4 at column10 and13. So no conflict.\n\nBlock3 (rows4-5, cols5-6):\n\nRow3 (index3): place 1 at column4 and 2 at column7.\n\nRow6: place 3 at column4 and4 at column7.\n\nBlock4 (rows6-7, cols12-13):\n\nRow5 (index5): place1 at column11 and2 at column14.\n\nRow8: place3 at column11 and4 at column14.\n\nBlock5 (rows10-11, cols2-3):\n\nRow9: place1 at column1 and2 at column4.\n\nRow12: place3 at column1 and4 at column4.\n\nBlock6 (rows11-12, cols9-10):\n\nRow10 (index10): place1 at column8 and2 at column11.\n\nRow13 (index13): place3 at column8 and4 at column11.\n\nNow, let's check if these positions are possible. For example, row0:\n\nOriginal row0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nAfter Block1: 1 at 0,0 and 2 at0,3.\n\nAfter Block2: 1 at0,10 and2 at0,13.\n\nSo row0 becomes: [1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0].\n\nWait, but in the training examples, each block's numbers are independent. So even if multiple blocks contribute to the same row, their markers are added. So overlapping might happen, but according to the training examples, it's allowed.\n\nSimilarly, row3:\n\nFrom Block1: 3 at3,0 and4 at3,3.\n\nFrom Block2:3 at3,10 and4 at3,13.\n\nFrom Block3:1 at3,4 and2 at3,7.\n\nSo row3 will have 3 at0, 4 at3, 1 at4, 2 at7, 3 at10,4 at13.\n\nSo row3: [3,0,0,4,1,0,0,2,0,0,3,0,0,4,0].\n\nBut wait, in the original test input, row3 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So all the inserted numbers are in zeros.\n\nNow, let's proceed to build the output grid.\n\nBut wait, the test input's existing 5s should remain. So in the output, all the original 5s are kept, and the 1,2,3,4 are added as per the blocks.\n\nSo each row in the output is the original row with 0s replaced by the markers where applicable.\n\nLet's start building each row of the test input's output.\n\nRow0 (original all zeros):\n\nAfter Block1 and Block2:\n\nIndices 0 (1),3 (2),10 (1),13 (2). So row0:\n\n[1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow1 (original has 5s at 1,2 and 11,12):\n\nWe don't modify the 5s. The markers are added in the rows above and below.\n\nRow1 remains as in input, except if any markers are added here. But for Block1, the markers are in row0 and row3. So row1's 5s are kept.\n\nRow2: same as input. 5s at 1,2 and 11,12.\n\nRow3 (original all zeros):\n\nNow after processing:\n\n3 at0, 4 at3, 1 at4, 2 at7, 3 at10,4 at13.\n\nSo row3 becomes:\n\n[3, 0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nRow4: original has 5s at columns5-6. So they remain. Also, from Block3, markers in row3 and row6.\n\nRow4 remains as in input.\n\nRow5: original has 5s at columns5-6. Also, from Block4, markers are added in row5 (1 and 2 at columns11 and14) and row8 (3 and4).\n\nSo row5's original input is [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Now, adding 1 at column11 and 2 at14 (from Block4):\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2]\n\nRow6: original has 5s at columns12-13. Also, from Block3, markers in row6 (3 and4 at4 and7). So row6's input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0]. Adding 3 at4 and4 at7:\n\n[0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nRow7: input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0]. No markers here except from Block4, which affects row5 and8.\n\nRow8: original all zeros. From Block4, add3 and4 at11 and14. So row8 becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4].\n\nRow9: original all zeros. From Block5, add1 at1 and2 at4.\n\n[0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow10: input has 5s at2-3. From Block5, add1 and2 in row9 and row12. Also, from Block6, add1 at8 and2 at11 in row10. So row10's input is [0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Adding 1 at8 and2 at11:\n\n[0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow11: input has 5s at2-3 and9-10. Also, from Block6, markers added in row10 and13. So row11 remains as input, except for any markers added in its row. But Block6's markers are in row10 and13. So row11's 5s remain.\n\nRow12: input has 5s at9-10. From Block5, add3 and4 in row12 (columns1 and4). From Block6, add3 and4 in row13. So row12's input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0]. Adding3 at1 and4:\n\n[0,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow13: original all zeros. From Block6, add3 at8 and4 at11. So row13 becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,0,0,0].\n\nRow14: original all zeros. No markers here.\n\nNow, putting all together, the output rows should be as follows:\n\nRow0: [1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nRow1: [0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0] (unchanged)\n\nRow2: [0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0] (unchanged)\n\nRow3: [3,0,0,4,1,0,0,2,0,0,3,0,0,4,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (unchanged)\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0] (unchanged)\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4]\n\nRow9: [0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow10: [0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow11: [0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0] (unchanged)\n\nRow12: [0,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow13: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow14: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLet me check if this matches the pattern in the training examples.\n\nFor example, in Example1, the markers are added around each 5-block, and multiple blocks can have markers in the same rows. For instance, in Example1's output, row5 has markers from the second block. Similarly, in the test input's row5, markers are added from Block4.\n\nNow, let's verify if there are any overlaps or errors.\n\nLooking at Block1 and Block2's markers in row0 and row3. All markers are placed correctly.\n\nBlock3's markers in row3 and row6. Correct.\n\nBlock4's markers in row5 and row8. Correct.\n\nBlock5's markers in row9 and row12. Correct.\n\nBlock6's markers in row10 and row13. Correct.\n\nYes, this seems to follow the pattern from the training examples. Each 2x2 block of 5s has 1 and 2 in the row above, left-1 and right+1, and 3 and4 in the row below. The numbers are assigned per block and can appear multiple times in the grid.",
