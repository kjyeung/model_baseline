        "cot_1": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples, then apply it to the test input. Let me start by looking closely at the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input has a 4 in the 10th column of the fourth row. In the output, that 4 is part of a horizontal line of five 4s starting from the sixth column of the same row. So maybe any single number (like the 4 here) is expanded into a horizontal line of five of the same number, centered around the original position? Wait, the original 4 is at position 9 (0-based index 9) in row 3 (0-based index 3). The output row becomes [8,8,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,8,8]. So the original 4 is at index 9, but the line starts at index 5 (columns 6 to 10). Wait, that's a stretch. Maybe the 4 is in the middle of a 5-length horizontal line. But 5 is odd, so the center is position 2, but here the line starts at column 6. Hmm, perhaps the line is placed starting from the position of the 4 and extends to the right? No, the original 4 is at column 9 (assuming 0-based), and the output line is from 5 to 9 (columns 5 to 9 inclusive?), but the output shows 4s starting at column 5 (index 5) through 9 (index 9). Wait, the input row is [8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,4,8,8]. The 4 is at index 9. The output replaces the 8s to the left of the 4 with 4s. So maybe when there's a single occurrence of a number (not part of a block), it creates a horizontal line of five of that number, replacing neighboring elements. But how is the direction determined? Or maybe it's that whenever there's a number that's not part of a larger block, it's extended into a horizontal line of five?\n\nWait, looking at Example 1: The input has an 8 in row 8, column 3 (0-based). The output replaces that 8 with a vertical line of four 8s in the same column, rows 5-8. So maybe when a single number is present (like a 4 in Example 0, an 8 in Example 1), it's either extended horizontally or vertically into a line of five or four, depending on the example. Hmm, that's conflicting. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0, the 4 is a single occurrence. The output replaces the 4 and surrounding cells to make a horizontal line of five 4s. In Example 1, the 8 is a single occurrence, but the output creates a vertical line of four 8s. Wait, the input in Example 1's 8 is at row 8, column 3. The output has 8s in rows 5-8, column 3. So that's four 8s (rows 5,6,7,8). So why the difference between horizontal and vertical? Maybe the direction depends on the surrounding blocks. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is to connect the single number to the nearest similar number in a certain direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that any isolated number (not part of a group) is expanded into a line either horizontally or vertically. Wait, but how to determine direction. Let's look at other examples.\n\nIn Example 2: The input has a 2 in row 0, column 4, and another 2 in row 11, column 1. The output for row 0: the 2 is at column 4. The output has four 2s starting from column 4 (but the output shows rows 0-3 of column 4 as 2s). Wait, no. Let me check the input and output for Example 2.\n\nInput Example 2's input has in row 0: [1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. The output for row 0 is same, but rows 1-3 have the 2 in column 4 replaced with 2s in that column. So the 2 in row 0, column 4 is causing the next three rows in that column to also become 2. So vertical expansion. Similarly, the 2 in row 11, column 1 (input) becomes part of a vertical line in the output? Looking at the output for Example 2, the 2 in row 11 is now part of a vertical line? The output for row 11 is [1,2,1,...], same as input, but in the output, the row above (row 10) is unchanged. Wait, perhaps the transformation is different here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that when a number is adjacent (vertically or horizontally) to another number, but maybe when a number is isolated, it creates a cross or line. Wait, perhaps the key is that whenever a number appears as a single cell (not part of a horizontal or vertical block of same numbers), it is replaced with a horizontal or vertical line of length 5 (or another fixed length) in a certain direction.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 3: The input has several 4s scattered. The output for the rows with 4s seems to create a horizontal line. For instance, the input has a 4 in row 5, column 2 (0-based). The output in row 5 is [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,5,...], so the 4 is expanded into five 4s horizontally. Similarly, the 4 in row 3, column 11 (input) becomes part of a horizontal line in the output. So perhaps whenever a single number is present (not in a horizontal or vertical group), it's expanded into a horizontal line of five of the same number. But in Example 0, the 4 is expanded into five 4s horizontally, starting from column 5 to 9. Similarly, in Example 3, the 4 in row 5 becomes a horizontal line of five.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 8 in the input is a single cell (row 8, column 3). The output creates a vertical line of four 8s in that column, rows 5-8. Wait, why the difference in direction here? Maybe the direction depends on the surrounding numbers. For example, if the single number is in a row where there's space to expand horizontally, but in other cases, it's vertical. Alternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the presence of other numbers nearby. Or maybe the direction alternates or follows a certain rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for any single occurrence of a number (not part of a block of same numbers), it creates a line of that number either horizontally or vertically, replacing the surrounding cells. The direction could be determined by checking whether there's a vertical or horizontal group nearby. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 0: The 4 is in a row where the next columns to the left are 8s, so it's possible to expand left. But in the output, the 4's line starts from column 5 (0-based 5?) and includes five 4s. Wait, the input row is [8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,4,8,8]. The 4 is at position 9. The output row is [8,8,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,8,8]. So the 4 is expanded to the left, replacing the previous 8s, making five 4s from position 5 to 9. So the expansion is to the left, starting from the original position and extending left for four more cells. Wait, but that would be five cells: original at 9, then 8,7,6,5. So positions 5,6,7,8,9. So five 4s. So the direction is left? But why not right? Because to the right of the 4 is 8, so maybe if there's space, it's filled. So maybe the line is created leftwards.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3, the 4 in row 5 is at column 2. The output expands to the right: positions 2,3,4,5,6 (five 4s). So the expansion is to the right. Wait, original 4 is at column 2, output has columns 2-6 as 4s. So that's five cells. So maybe the direction is to the right, but in Example 0, the expansion is to the left. That's conflicting. So perhaps the direction is determined by some other factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the line is centered on the original number, but only if possible. For example, in Example 0, the 4 is at position 9. To center a line of five, the center would be position 9, so the line would be positions 7,8,9,10,11. But the output line is positions 5-9. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the line is placed such that the original number is the last element, and the line extends to the left. For example, in Example 0, the 4 is at position 9, and the line starts at 5 (five elements from 5 to 9). So the line is five elements to the left, starting from the original position. So length 5, covering positions 5 to 9. But how does that make sense?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the line is placed starting from the original cell and extending to the left for four cells, making five in total. But why? In Example 0, the original cell is 9, so the line would be 9,8,7,6,5. But the output shows that positions 5-9 (columns 6-10) are 4s. Wait, maybe the indices are 0-based. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input row (Example 0's fourth row, INPUT):\n\n[8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8]\n\nIndices 0-11. The 4 is at index 9. The output row:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 8]\n\nSo the 4s start at index 5 (value 4) and go to index 9. That's five elements. So from index 5 to 9. How does that relate to the original position? The original 4 is at index 9. The line is five elements starting at index 5. So the line is to the left of the original 4. So the 4 is the last element of the line. So perhaps the rule is: when a single cell has a number, replace the four cells to the left (if possible) to form a horizontal line of five. But why in Example 3, the expansion is to the right?\n\nLooking at Example 3's row 5 in input: the 4 is at index 2. The output line is [4,4,4,4,4] starting from index 2. Wait, the output row for row 5 is:\n\n[1,1,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nSo the 4s start at index 2 (0-based) and span five positions: indices 2-6 (but the fifth index would be 2+4=6). So in this case, the line extends to the right. So why in Example 0, the line is to the left, and in Example 3, to the right? That's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the surrounding elements. For example, in Example 0, the cell to the left of the 4 is 8, so the line can be extended leftwards. In Example 3, the cell to the left of the 4 is 1 (row 5, index 1), and to the right are 1s (indexes 3-6?), but in the input row 5 of Example 3, the 4 is part of a group of 5 5s. Wait, no: input row 5 of Example 3's input is:\n\n[1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5,5,5,5,5,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nSo the 4 is at index 2, and the next cells (indexes 3-6) are 1,1,1,1. So the output changes those to 4, creating a horizontal line of five 4s. So the line extends to the right. So the rule might be: when a single cell has a number that is not part of a horizontal or vertical group, replace the next four cells to the right with the same number to form a horizontal line of five. But in Example 0, the line is to the left, which contradicts this.\n\nHmm, perhaps the direction is determined by the direction where there are enough same numbers. Alternatively, maybe the line is placed to the left if possible, otherwise to the right, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that any single cell (not part of a block of the same number) is replaced with a horizontal line of five of that number. If there's enough space to the left, the line extends left, otherwise right. Or perhaps the line is always placed to the left. Wait, in Example 0, the line is to the left, but in Example 3, the line is to the right. So maybe the direction depends on the position. For example, if the cell is near the end of the row, it can't extend to the right, so it goes left. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the 4 is at index 9 in a row of length 12. To make a horizontal line of five to the right, you'd need indices 9-13, but the row ends at 11, so it can't. Therefore, it extends to the left. So the line is from index 5 to 9. That's five elements. So perhaps the rule is: when a single cell (not in a group) is found, create a horizontal line of five cells. If possible, extend to the left first. If there's not enough space to the left, extend to the right. But how is 'enough space' determined?\n\nIn Example 3's row 5: the 4 is at index 2. To create a line of five to the left, starting at index 2, you would need indices 2-6 (if extending right). Alternatively, to the left, indexes 0-4. But the original cell is at 2. If we want to have five elements, starting from index 2 and going right, indexes 2,3,4,5,6. The input has those cells as 4,1,1,1,1. So replacing those with 4s. So maybe the line is created to the right.\n\nWait, perhaps the line is created to the right, starting at the original cell's position. But in Example 0, the original cell is at index 9. To create a line to the right of five elements, we need indexes 9,10,11,12,13. But since the row ends at index 11, it's not possible. So the line is shifted to the left. How?\n\nAlternatively, the line is centered on the original cell, but if there's not enough space to the left or right, adjust accordingly. For example, a line of five cells needs two cells to the left and two to the right of the original. But if there's not enough space, adjust. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's 4 at index 9. To center, the line would be positions 7,8,9,10,11. But positions 10 and 11 are 8,8. So that's possible. But in the output, the line is at 5-9. So this doesn't fit. So maybe the centering idea is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the line is placed such that the original cell is the last in the line. So for a line of five, the original cell is the fifth element. So in Example 0, the original cell is at 9. The line would start at 5 (since 9-4=5). So five elements: 5,6,7,8,9. That's what the output shows. So the line starts four positions to the left of the original. Similarly, in Example 3's row 5: original cell is at 2. If the line is five elements starting at 2, then positions 2,3,4,5,6. Which matches the output. So the rule could be: whenever a single cell (not part of a group) is found, create a horizontal line of five elements, starting at the original cell's position and extending to the right. If there's not enough space (like at the end of the row), then start further left to fit all five.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the original cell is at 9. The line needs five elements. Starting at 9 would require four more elements to the right (10,11,12,13), but 12 and 13 are beyond the row length (12 elements, indexes 0-11). So, not possible. So in that case, the line starts at 9-4=5 (since 9 is the end, and five elements need to fit). So the line starts at 5 and ends at 9. So that's five elements. So the rule could be: when a single cell is found, create a horizontal line of five cells. If the original cell's position allows for four cells to the right, start there. If not, start such that the line ends at the original cell. For example, if the cell is near the end, start earlier so that the line ends at the cell.\n\nBut how do we determine this for any case? Let's see.\n\nAnother example: Example 1's input has an 8 at row 8, column 3. The output changes rows 5-8 in column 3 to 8. So vertical line. So perhaps when horizontal expansion is not possible (due to existing numbers), the expansion is vertical. But in Example 1's input, the 8 is in column 3. The input row 8 has 2s except for column 3. The output creates a vertical line of four 8s from row 5 to 8. So maybe the vertical line is four elements long. But why four? Why not five?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction depends on the surrounding. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is surrounded by 2s. If a horizontal line isn't possible (because there's a different number), then it tries vertical.\n\nBut this complicates the pattern. Let me check all examples again.\n\nExample 1's input has the 8 in row 8, column 3. The output creates a vertical line from row 5 to 8 (four rows) in column 3. So four 8s. But why four? The original cell is row 8. So maybe the line extends upwards for three cells (rows 5,6,7,8), totaling four cells. So four elements. So why four and not five?\n\nExample 2's input has a 2 in row 0, column 4. The output has four 2s in column 4 from rows 0 to 3. So four elements. So perhaps the vertical lines are four in length. But why? Or maybe the vertical lines are as long as possible until a different number is encountered.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the 2 in row 0, column 4 is the only 2 in that column. The output changes rows 0-3 of column 4 to 2, making a vertical line of four. So maybe the vertical line extends upwards until it hits the top or a different number. But in Example 2's input, row 0 is the top, so it can't go higher. So the line extends down from row 0 to row 3 (four rows). But why? That's four cells.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the 8 in row 8 is in a column where rows 5-8 are changed to 8. So four rows. But why not more?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical lines are four cells long, placed above the original cell. So the original cell is the last in the line. For example, in Example 1, the original cell is row 8. The vertical line starts at row 5 (four cells: 5,6,7,8). So four cells. Similarly, in Example 2, the original cell is row 0. So the vertical line would have to start at row 0, but how can it be four cells long? But in Example 2's output, rows 0-3 have the 2 in column 4. That's four rows. So perhaps the vertical line is always four cells long, with the original cell being the bottom one. So starting three rows above the original.\n\nSo for a vertical line, the rule would be: replace the original cell and three cells above it with the same number, creating a vertical line of four. But what if there's not enough space above? For example, if the original cell is in row 2, then the line would be rows 0,1,2,3 (four cells). Wait, no. Original cell is row 8 in Example 1. The line is rows 5,6,7,8. Original cell is the last in the line. So the line starts three rows above.\n\nSo for vertical lines, the line is four cells long, starting three rows above the original. If there's not enough space above, adjust. But in Example 2's case, the original cell is row 0. So three rows above would be negative, which isn't possible. So maybe the line starts at row 0 and extends down three rows. But Example 2's output has four rows (0-3). So perhaps the line is four cells long, starting at the original cell and extending down three rows. But in Example 1, the original cell is row 8, and the line starts at row 5 and extends to 8. So four rows. That fits.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to summarize possible patterns:\n\n- For horizontal lines: when a single cell (not part of a horizontal group) is found, create a horizontal line of five cells, centered on the original cell if possible, adjusting if at the edges. The direction depends on available space.\n\n- For vertical lines: when a single cell (not part of a vertical group) is found, create a vertical line of four cells, with the original cell at the bottom. If not enough space, adjust upwards.\n\nBut how to determine when to apply horizontal vs vertical?\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\n- Example 0: single 4 becomes horizontal line of five.\n\n- Example 1: single 8 becomes vertical line of four.\n\n- Example 2: single 2 becomes vertical line of four in column 4, and another 2 becomes... wait, in Example 2, there are two 2s in the input. The first is in row 0, column 4. The output has a vertical line of four (rows 0-3) in column 4. The second 2 is in row 11, column 1. The output for that row remains the same. Hmm, maybe that second 2 is part of a different transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is applied to certain cells based on some condition. For example, only cells that are not adjacent to other numbers of the same value. But I need to check.\n\nIn Example 0's 4: it's surrounded by 8s. So isolated. So it's transformed into a horizontal line.\n\nExample 1's 8 is surrounded by 2s. So isolated. Transformed into a vertical line.\n\nExample 3's 4 in row 5 is surrounded by 1s and 5s. So transformed into a horizontal line.\n\nSo the pattern could be: if a cell is isolated (no adjacent same numbers in any direction), then expand it into a horizontal line of five cells. If that's not possible (due to boundaries), then expand vertically into four cells. Or perhaps the direction is determined based on which expansion is possible.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 8 could have been expanded horizontally. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 8 is in row 8, column 3. The input row is [2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]. So if expanding horizontally, the line would need to cover columns 3-7 (five cells). But the output chooses to expand vertically. So why?\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is to expand vertically if the horizontal expansion is not possible (due to existing different numbers). For example, in Example 1's row 8, columns to the left and right of 3 are 2s. So expanding horizontally would require replacing those 2s with 8s. But why is that not done in the output? Instead, the output expands vertically. So maybe the direction is vertical when the original number is in a position where vertical expansion is possible (i.e., the rows above are of the same number as the surrounding numbers).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for any isolated cell, a horizontal line is created if possible (sufficient space to the left or right), and if not, a vertical line is created. But how to determine which is possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction depends on the surrounding numbers. For example, if the cell is surrounded by the same number in vertical direction, but not horizontal. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that isolated numbers are replaced with a cross shape (horizontal and vertical lines), but the examples don't show that. For example, Example 0's 4 is a horizontal line, not a cross. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to look for isolated numbers and then connect them to the nearest block of the same number. For example, in Example 0, the 4 is isolated, and perhaps there's another 4 elsewhere that it connects to. But in the input, there's only one 4.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nLooking at the training examples, each output changes some isolated numbers into horizontal or vertical lines of the same number, replacing surrounding cells. The key seems to be that isolated numbers are expanded into lines. The direction varies: sometimes horizontal, sometimes vertical.\n\nBut how to determine the direction. Let's look for a pattern in the direction chosen.\n\nExample 0: 4 is isolated. Output is horizontal line.\n\nExample 1: 8 is isolated. Output is vertical line.\n\nExample 2: 2 in row 0, column 4. Output is vertical line (four 2s in that column, rows 0-3).\n\nExample 3: 4 in row 5, column 2. Output is horizontal line.\n\nSo, what determines horizontal vs vertical? It might be the position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the row, perhaps horizontal; near the edges, vertical. But in Example 0, the 4 is near the end of the row (column 9 of 12), but it's horizontal. In Example 1, the 8 is in column 3 of row 8, which is not near the edge, but vertical.\n\nAlternatively, it could depend on the surrounding numbers. For instance, if expanding horizontally would require overwriting different numbers, then do vertical. But in Example 1's input, the 8 is in a row of 2s. So expanding horizontally would overwrite 2s. But the output does vertical, overwriting 2s in the column. So why choose vertical over horizontal? Maybe the decision is arbitrary, or there's another factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction alternates between examples, but that doesn't help for the test case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the number of possible expansions. For example, in Example 0, there's space to the left to create a horizontal line. In Example 1, perhaps there's more space vertically.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is vertical if the isolated number is in a column where other numbers are present below or above. But this is unclear.\n\nAnother approach: look for the output lines and see how they relate to other parts of the grid.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the horizontal line of 4s connects to the 3s. No, the 3s are in columns 2-4, and the 4s are in 5-9. Not connected.\n\nIn Example 3's output, the horizontal 4 line connects to the 5s. No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lines are placed to form a cross with other lines. But this doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, the lines are placed to fill empty space between other blocks. For example, in Example 0, the 4's line is placed between the 3s and the other 8s. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to find a different approach. Maybe the pattern is that each isolated number (appearing only once, not adjacent to the same number) is replaced by a line (horizontal or vertical) of the same number, with the line's direction determined by the majority of surrounding numbers. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the line is placed in the direction where there's a block of the same number. For example, if there's a horizontal block nearby, expand horizontally. But this is not consistent with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is determined by the number's value. For example, even numbers expand horizontally, odd vertically. But 4 is even (Example 0, horizontal), 8 is even (Example 1, vertical), so that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a single occurrence of a number, it's replaced by a horizontal line of five of the same number, and if there's already a horizontal line in the same row, it's extended. But that doesn't fit Example 1's vertical line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to connect isolated numbers to other instances of the same number via lines. For example, in Example 3's input, there are multiple 4s scattered. The output connects them with horizontal lines. For instance, the 4 in row 5 is connected to the 4 in row 3 via a horizontal line. But I need to check.\n\nIn Example 3's input, there are 4s in rows 1, 3, 4, 5, and 11. The output for row 1 has a 4 in column 8, and in the output, rows 1-4 have 4s in column 8. So vertical line. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the output in Example 3's rows 1-4, column 8, have 4s. The input row 1 has a 4 in column 8. The output for row 1 has 4, then row 2's column 8 is 4 (which was 1 in input), row 3's column 8 is 4 (input was 1), etc. So a vertical line of 4s. So the original 4 in row 1, column 8 is expanded vertically into four rows (rows 1-4).\n\nBut why? That's a vertical line of four. So perhaps the rule is: for any isolated number, create a vertical line of four. But why then in Example 0, it's a horizontal line.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at all examples, the key is that the output replaces certain single cells with lines of the same number. The direction varies, but perhaps the line is always placed in a way that it's adjacent to a block of a different number.\n\nFor instance, in Example 0's input, the 4 is next to a block of 3s. The output's horizontal line of 4s is adjacent to the 3 block. In Example 3's row 5, the 4 line is adjacent to the 5 block. So maybe the line is placed to connect to another block.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the line is placed in the direction of the nearest block of the same number. But in Example 0, the 4 is the only 4, so no other block. So this doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, the line is placed to separate different numbers. For example, the 4 line in Example 0 is between the 3 block and the 8s. But this is speculative.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the number of elements in the lines. Horizontal lines in the output examples are five elements long (Example 0, 3), vertical lines are four (Example 1, 2, 3). Maybe the rule is horizontal lines are five, vertical are four.\n\nIf that's the case, then for any isolated number, create a horizontal line of five if possible, else vertical line of four. But how to determine which is possible.\n\nFor example, in Example 0, the 4 is in column 9. To create a horizontal line of five, starting at column 5 (indexes 5-9), which is possible. So done.\n\nIn Example 1's 8 in column 3, row 8. To create a horizontal line of five, columns 3-7. But those columns in row 8 are 2s. So the output would need to change those to 8s, but in Example 1's output, it's done vertically instead. So why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is created only if the cells to the left and right are the same as the surrounding background. In Example 0, the background is 8. The 4's horizontal line is replacing 8s with 4s. In Example 1, the background is 2. The 8's vertical line is replacing 2s with 8s. So perhaps the line is created in the direction where the surrounding cells are the same (background), allowing replacement.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's input, the 8 is surrounded by 2s. To create a horizontal line, the cells to the left and right are 2s. But the output chooses to create a vertical line. So why? Maybe because the vertical direction has more consecutive background cells. But in row 8, the cells to the left and right of column 3 are 2s, so horizontal expansion is possible. But the output does vertical.\n\nThis isn't clear. Given the time I've spent and the examples, perhaps the pattern is:\n\n- Whenever there's an isolated number (not part of a horizontal or vertical block), replace it with a horizontal line of five of the same number, extending to the left if possible, otherwise to the right. If that's not possible (due to boundaries), then create a vertical line of four, extending upwards if possible, otherwise downwards.\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input has a few isolated numbers. Let's look for cells that are isolated (surrounded by different numbers).\n\nLooking at the test input rows:\n\nRow 1: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]. The '1' is at column 9. Surrounded by 2s. So isolated.\n\nRow 2: [2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2]. Two '1's at columns 2 and 17. Both isolated.\n\nRow 3: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]. '1' at column 13.\n\nRow 7: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,1,2]. '1' at column 19.\n\nRow 13: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2]. '1' at column 15.\n\nRow 17: [2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]. Two '1's at columns 3 and 11.\n\nThese are all the '1's in the test input. Additionally, there are '8's in rows 5-10, columns 7-14 (but part of a block). So those are not isolated.\n\nNow, according to the pattern I hypothesized, each isolated '1' should be replaced with a horizontal line of five '1's, or if not possible, a vertical line of four.\n\nLet's take the first '1' in row 1, column 9. The row is 21 elements long (indexes 0-20). The '1' is at index 9. To create a horizontal line of five, centered at 9, but need to check if possible. If the line is to the left, starting at 5 (9-4=5), but the row's elements from 5 to 9 are 2s (original row is all 2s except for 1 at 9). So replacing those with 1s. So the output would have 1s from indexes 5-9.\n\nSimilarly, the '1's in row 2, columns 2 and 17. Each is isolated. For column 2: line of five 1s horizontally. If possible, starting at column 2 and extending to the right (indexes 2-6). For column 17: the line would need to start at 13 (17-4=13) to get five elements (13-17). But indexes 13-17 are all 2s, so replaced with 1s.\n\nThe '1' in row 3, column 13: horizontal line would start at 9 (13-4=9), indexes 9-13. Replaced with 1s.\n\nThe '1' in row 7, column 19: the line needs five elements. Since 19 is near the end of the row (indexes 0-20), possible to start at 15 (19-4=15), but indexes 15-19 would be columns 15-19. The original row's 15-19 are 2s except for 19.\n\nThe '1' in row 13, column 15: line starts at 11 (15-4=11), indexes 11-15.\n\nThe '1's in row 17, columns 3 and 11: each would have lines of five 1s.\n\nNow, also check if any of these '1's are part of a vertical or horizontal block. In the input, all '1's are isolated, so they should be transformed.\n\nIn addition to the '1's, there's an '8' block in rows 5-10, columns 7-14. These are part of a block, so not transformed.\n\nSo applying the pattern, each isolated '1' becomes a horizontal line of five '1's.\n\nNow, looking at the test input's rows, after transformation:\n\nFor example, row 1: the '1' at column 9 becomes a line from 5-9. So indexes 5-9 (columns 6-10) would be 1s.\n\nRow 2: '1's at columns 2 and 17. Each would become five 1s.\n\nRow 3: '1' at column 13 becomes five 1s.\n\nRow 7: '1' at column 19 would become 1s from 15-19.\n\nRow 13: '1' at 15 becomes 11-15.\n\nRow 17: '1's at 3 and 11 become lines.\n\nSo the output would have these horizontal lines replacing the isolated '1's.\n\nAdditionally, the '8' block is part of a larger group, so no changes there.\n\nSo the final answer would be the test input with each isolated '1' replaced by a horizontal line of five '1's.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern in the training examples that transforms the input into the output and then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by looking at each training example carefully.\n\nFirst, let's look at Example 0. The input has several rows with mostly 8s and some 3s and a 4. The output seems to change the row where the 4 is. In the input's fourth row, there's an 8 at position 9 (0-based index maybe?), and in the output, that row now has a sequence of four 4s starting from position 5. So maybe the 4 in the input is causing some expansion to the left or right?\n\nExample 1: The input has a lot of 2s, a block of 1s, and an 8 in the bottom rows. The output changes the rows below the 8. In the input, the 8 is in row 8 (assuming rows are 0-indexed), and in the output, the rows below it (rows 5-8?) have 8s in the same column. So maybe the 8 is creating a vertical line downward?\n\nExample 2: The input has a 2 in the first row and a 2 in row 6. The output seems to have multiple 2s vertically aligned under them. Like in row 6, the 2 is part of a horizontal line. Wait, the input's row 6 has a 2 at the end, and the output's row 6 has a line of 2s. Hmm, maybe when there's a number that's different from the surrounding, it propagates in some direction?\n\nExample 3: The input has 4s and 5s. The output has the 4s in the fifth row expanded into a horizontal line. Also, the 4s in other rows are extended vertically. For instance, the 4 in row 1 is replicated in the rows below, creating a vertical line. So when a number is alone, it might create a vertical line, but when part of a horizontal block, it extends horizontally?\n\nPutting this together, maybe the pattern is that when a number is part of a horizontal sequence (like a block of 3s or 4s), any single occurrence of a different number in that row (like a 4 in a row of 8s) creates a horizontal line of that number. Alternatively, if a number is isolated, it might create a vertical line of that number downward or upward.\n\nLooking at the test input now. Let's see. The test input has a lot of 2s. The rows with 8s are in the middle, forming a horizontal block. Then there's a 1 in some positions. For example, in row 1 (second row), there's a 1 at index 9. In the output, perhaps that 1 would cause a vertical line of 1s downward. Similarly, other 1s might propagate. Let's check where the 1s are in the test input:\n\nRow 1: [2,2,...,1,...]\nRow 2: [2,2,1,...]\nRow 3: ... 1 at position 13\nRow 7: 1 at position 19\nRow 13: 1 at position 15\nRow 17: 1 at position 3 and 11\n\nSo for each of these 1s in the input, maybe they turn into vertical lines downward. But wait in the training examples, like Example 1, the 8 in row 8 (if rows are 0-indexed) caused the next few rows to have 8s in the same column. So in the test input, each 1 should create a vertical line below them. Let's see.\n\nFor example, in row 1 (index 1), column 9 is 1. Then in the output, rows below that (rows 2,3,4,5?) would have 1 in column 9. But in the test input, row 2 has a 1 at column 2. So perhaps the 1 in row 1 column 9 would create a vertical line down from there. But in the original input, row 2 column 2 is 1, which might interfere. Wait, but in Example 1, the input had a 8 in row 8, and the output added 8s in the same column in the rows below. Similarly, Example 3 had a 4 in row 1 and then the rows below had 4s in the same column. So the pattern is: any cell with a number that is not part of a horizontal block (i.e., it's a single occurrence or not part of a longer horizontal sequence) will create a vertical line downward of that number until it hits another number or the end. Wait, but in Example 0, the 4 in the input row 3 column 9 is part of the output as a horizontal line. So maybe when a number is part of a horizontal block, it's left as is, but if it's a single occurrence, then it's expanded into a vertical line.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 4 is alone in row 3 column 9. In the output, that 4 is part of a horizontal line of five 4s starting from column 5. So maybe if a single number is present in a row, and that number is different from the surrounding numbers (which are 8s), it creates a horizontal line to the left until it hits a boundary or another different number. Wait, the output in Example 0's fourth row has 4s from column 5 to 9. The input had 8,4,8. So maybe the 4 is expanded to the left, replacing the 8s until it reaches a boundary or another block. Hmm, perhaps the transformation is that any single cell with a number that is different from the surrounding (which is a different number) is expanded to the left and right to fill the entire row, but only if the surrounding cells are the same as the background number. Wait, but in Example 0, the 4 is in a row of 8s. The output changes that row to have 4s from column 5 to 9 (assuming 0-based). Wait the input row was [8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. The output changes that to [8,8,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,8,8]. Wait no, in Example 0's input, the fourth row is [8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,4,8,8]. The output is [8,8,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,8,8]. So the 4 is expanded to the left, replacing the 8s until it hits the 3s. So the 4 is extended leftwards as far as possible (until a different number is encountered) and fills all the 8s between the 3s and the 4 with 4s. So in that case, the 4 is in column 9, and to the left of it are 8s until column 5 (since columns 2-4 are 3s). So from column 5 to 9, the 4s are placed. So the rule here seems to be: if a cell has a number that is not part of a horizontal block (i.e., it's a single occurrence surrounded by a different number), then in the output, replace all the cells to the left and right of it (within the same row) that are of the background number (the surrounding number) with the cell's number, up to the nearest different numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps whenever there's a single number (not part of a horizontal group) in a row, it creates a horizontal line stretching to the left and right, replacing the background number until it hits a different number.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has an 8 in the last row (row 8) at column 3. The output has rows 5-8 in column 3 as 8s. So that 8 is extended downward vertically. So maybe if a number is a single occurrence in a column, it's extended downward as a vertical line. Wait, but in that example, the 8 is in row 8, column 3, and the output has rows 5-8 (rows 5,6,7,8) in column 3 as 8. Wait, that's upward. Wait, the input's row 8 (if rows are 0-based) would be the ninth row. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 1's input:\n\nThe input has 10 rows. The 8 is in row 8 (0-based index 8). The output changes rows 5,6,7,8 (0-based 5-8) in column 3 to 8. So it's extending upward. So the 8 in row 8 (input) is causing the four rows above it to also have 8 in column 3. So perhaps the rule is that a single occurrence of a number in a row (not part of a horizontal block) creates a vertical line upward, replacing the background number in the same column for all rows above until another number is hit.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, there's a 4 in row 5 (input) column 2. The output's row 5 has 4s from column 2 to 6. So perhaps when a number is in a row with other numbers (like the 5s in that row), it's part of a horizontal block, but if it's alone, it's part of a vertical line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves two steps: first, any single numbers (not part of a horizontal group) in the input are extended vertically upward, and any numbers that are part of horizontal groups are extended horizontally to fill the background.\n\nBut let's look at another example. Example 2's input has a 2 in row 0, column 4. The output has that 2 replicated in the rows below (rows 1-3?), making a vertical line. So the 2 is extended downward. Wait, in the input, the first row (row 0) has a 2, and in the output, rows 0-3 have 2s in column 4. So that 2 is extended downward. But in Example 1, the 8 was extended upward. Hmm, this inconsistency is confusing. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the first row is [1,1,1,1,2,1,...]. The output has four rows (0-3) with 2 in column 4. So the single 2 in row 0 is extended downward for three more rows. Similarly, in row 6 of Example 2's input, there's a 2 in column 10, and the output's row 6 has a horizontal line of 2s from column 7 to 10. Wait, no. Wait the input's row 6 has a 2 in column 10. The output's row 6 is [1,1,1,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,1]. So the 2 in column 10 is part of a horizontal line from columns 7-10. But in the input, columns 7-10 in row 6 were 1,1,2,1. So perhaps the 2 is extended to the left and right, replacing 1s. So the 2 in column 10 is extended left to column 7, creating 2s in 7-10. So here, the 2 is part of a horizontal expansion.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is: any cell with a number that is not part of a horizontal block (i.e., the cells to the left and right are different) will cause that number to expand horizontally to fill all the adjacent cells of the background number (the surrounding number) in that row. Additionally, if the cell is isolated (not part of a vertical block), it may also expand vertically. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that in each row, any number that is not part of a horizontal group (i.e., surrounded by different numbers) is replaced by a horizontal line of that number spanning from the leftmost occurrence of a different number to the rightmost occurrence of a different number. Wait, in Example 0's row where the 4 is present: the input row is [8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,4,8,8]. The output row is [8,8,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,8,8]. So the 4 is in column 9. The 3s end at column 4 (since columns 2-4 are 3s). The 8s start again at column 5. So the 4 is after the 3s. The output replaces the 8s from column 5 to 9 with 4s. So the 4 is expanding to the left until it hits the 3s and to the right until the end (but in this case, after the 4, there's an 8, but in the output, the 4s extend to the right until column 9. Wait, the original 4 is at column 9, and the output has 4s up to column 9. So maybe the expansion is to the left until the first non-background number (the 3s), and to the right until the end of the row. But why? Because the background number here is 8. So the 4 expands to the left, replacing all 8s until it hits the 3s, and to the right, replacing all 8s until the end. But in the output row, the 4s start at column 5 (after the 3s) and go to column 9, making 5 4s. So from the original position at column 9, expanding left until the 3s, replacing all 8s in between.\n\nSo the rule could be: for any cell with a number that is not part of a horizontal block (i.e., the cell to the left and right are different from it), expand that number to the left and right within the same row, replacing all instances of the background number (the surrounding number) until a different number is encountered. Then, for any cell that is part of a vertical line (i.e., same number in the same column in consecutive rows), expand vertically as well. Wait, but in Example 1, the 8 is in row 8, column 3. The output has rows 5-8 in column 3 as 8. So it's extending upward, not downward. So perhaps when a number is found in a column, it creates a vertical line upward from that position to the first occurrence of a different number or the top of the grid.\n\nPutting this all together, the pattern seems to be:\n\n1. For each cell in the input grid:\n   a. If the cell's number is part of a horizontal block (i.e., adjacent cells in the same row are the same), leave it as is.\n   b. If the cell's number is isolated in its row (no adjacent same numbers), then expand it horizontally to the left and right, replacing all instances of the background number (the dominant number in the row) until a different number is encountered.\n\n2. Additionally, for any cell that is not part of a vertical block (i.e., no same numbers above or below), expand it vertically upward and/or downward, replacing the background number until a different number is encountered.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the 4 is alone in its row and becomes a horizontal line. In Example 1, the 8 is alone in its row and column and becomes a vertical line upward. In Example 2, the 2s are alone and become vertical lines downward and horizontal expansions. Example 3's 4s in the fifth row expand into a horizontal line, and the vertical expansions of 4s upward.\n\nSo combining these observations, perhaps the transformation works in two steps:\n\n- Horizontally expand any single number in a row to fill the background number until another different number is hit.\n- Vertically expand any single number in a column (after horizontal expansion) to fill the background number in that column upward or downward.\n\nBut how to determine the background number for each row or column? It seems like the background is the majority number in the row, or the number that is being replaced. For example, in Example 0's fourth row, the background is 8, and the 4 expands into the 8s. In Example 1's row with the 8, the background is 2, and the 8 expands into the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, the background number is the number that is present in the majority of the row before any expansion. For a row that has mostly 8s except for a few other numbers, the background is 8. Then, any isolated number in that row (not part of a horizontal block) expands into the background number's positions.\n\nWait, but in Example 3's fifth row, the input has a 4 in column 2, and the output expands that into a horizontal line of 4s from column 2 to 6. The original row is [1,1,4,1,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,1,...]. So the background here is 1 and 5. Wait, but the 4 is surrounded by 1s and 5s. So maybe the 4 expands into the 1s (left) and the 5s (right), but the output shows it expanding left into the 1s but not into the 5s. So in the output, the 4s are from column 2 to 6 (assuming 0-based), which are all the 1s. The 5s start at column 7, so the 4s don't expand into the 5s. So the expansion is only into the background number (1s) to the left until hitting the 5s. So the background number here would be the number that is to the left and right of the isolated number. Wait, but in that case, the 4 is between 1s and 5s. So maybe the expansion is only into the left (1s) until the next different number (the 5s). So the horizontal expansion is to the left and right, but only into cells that are of the same number as the adjacent cells. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the horizontal expansion is to the left and right as far as possible, replacing any cell that is not part of a horizontal block. For example, if a cell is isolated, it expands to fill all cells in its row that are not part of another horizontal block.\n\nAnother approach: For each row, look for cells that are not part of a horizontal group (i.e., their left and right neighbors are different). For such cells, expand them horizontally to the left and right, replacing all cells of the same type as the original neighboring cells. Wait, maybe not. Let's take Example 0 again. The row with the 4 has 3s to the left (columns 2-4), then 8s from column 5 to 9. The 4 is at column 9. When expanded, the 4 replaces the 8s from column 5 to 9, creating a block of 4s. So the expansion is replacing all the 8s between the 3s and the 4's original position. So the background here is 8, and the expansion replaces all 8s between the 3s and the 4.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3's fifth row, the 4 is at column 2. The row is [1,1,4,1,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,...]. The expansion of the 4 to the left replaces the 1s up to column 2 (but since the 4 is at column 2, maybe expanding left into the 1s. But the output shows that the 4 expands left into column 2 (original is column 2) and fills columns 2-6. Wait, columns 2-6 in the output are 4s. The original row had 4 at column 2, surrounded by 1s. So the expansion is to the right as well? Or perhaps to the left and right as far as possible, but not crossing other numbers. The output row is [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,...]. So from column 2 to 6, all are 4s. The 4 expands to the right until it hits the 5s (column 7). But the original row had 1s from column 3 to 6. So the expansion is replacing the 1s to the right of the 4 until the 5s. So the background here is 1 for the left and right of the 4. So the expansion replaces all 1s adjacent to the 4, expanding left and right until another number is hit.\n\nSo the pattern is: for any cell that is not part of a horizontal block (i.e., the cell's left and right are different from it), expand it to the left and right, replacing all instances of the background number (the number that was originally surrounding the cell) until another different number is encountered.\n\nThen, for vertical expansion: look at each column. For any cell that is now part of a horizontal block (after horizontal expansion), check if there are other cells in the same column that are part of their own horizontal blocks. If a cell is not part of a vertical block (i.e., it's alone in its column), expand it upward and/or downward, replacing the background number (which is the original number in those positions) with the cell's number.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try applying this to the test input.\n\nThe test input has several 1s in various positions. Let's look at row 1 (second row in the input), column 9 is 1. In the input, this 1 is surrounded by 2s. So according to the pattern, this 1 should expand horizontally to the left and right, replacing all 2s until it hits a different number. But in the input row 1: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]. So the 1 is at index 9. Expanding left and right in that row, replacing 2s with 1s until a different number is found. Since there are only 2s around, the entire row would become 1s except for other numbers. But in the input row 1, the 1 is the only non-2. So after expansion, the entire row would be 1s? But that's not possible, because the other rows have 2s. Wait, but according to Example 1, when there's an 8 in a row of 2s, the output expands it vertically upward. So perhaps the horizontal expansion is only for the row, and then vertical expansion is done based on the new horizontal blocks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after the horizontal expansion, any vertical alignment of a number that is now part of a horizontal block causes a vertical expansion. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, the test input's rows with 8s form a horizontal block (rows 5-10, columns 7-14). Those are already part of a horizontal block, so they remain as is. The 1s in other rows (like row 1, column 9) are isolated. Applying the horizontal expansion, this 1 would expand left and right in its row, replacing all 2s with 1s. So row 1 would become all 1s except where there are other numbers. But the test input's row 1 has only a single 1 and the rest 2s. So the entire row would become 1s. But looking at the training examples, that's not what happened. For example, in Example 1, the input row with an 8 had the 8 expanded vertically, not horizontally. So maybe the horizontal expansion only happens if the cell is not part of a vertical expansion.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the 8 is in row 8 (0-based index 8), column 3. The output has 8s in rows 5-8, column 3. So this is a vertical expansion upward. There's no horizontal expansion in that case. So perhaps the vertical expansion takes precedence over horizontal. Or maybe the rules are different.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to first expand vertically and then horizontally. Or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to identify \"seeds\" (cells that are not part of horizontal blocks) and then expand them both horizontally and vertically. For example, in Example 0, the 4 is a seed. It expands horizontally to fill the row between the 3s and the end. Then, perhaps vertically, but in the output, the 4 doesn't expand vertically. So maybe only horizontal expansion.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 is a seed. It expands vertically upward. In Example 2, the 2 in row 0 is a seed and expands downward. The 2 in row 6 is part of a horizontal expansion.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is: any seed (a cell that is not part of a horizontal block) will expand horizontally to fill the row, and vertically in the column.\n\nBut how to determine the direction. For the vertical expansion in Example 1, the seed is in the bottom row and expands upward. In Example 2, the seed is in the top row and expands downward. So maybe the vertical expansion is in both directions until another number is encountered.\n\nBut in Example 0, the 4 is in the middle of the grid and doesn't expand vertically, only horizontally. So maybe vertical expansion only happens if the seed is at the edge of a vertical block. Hmm, this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, vertical expansion is done only if the seed is not part of any horizontal block and there are same numbers in the same column. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to expand each seed cell into a cross shape: horizontal line in the row and vertical line in the column. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 3. The input's row 5 has a 4 in column 2. The output expands this 4 into a horizontal line from columns 2-6 (replacing 1s). Additionally, there are vertical expansions of 4s upward. For example, the 4 in row 1, column 8 becomes a vertical line downward. The output shows rows 1-4 in column 8 having 4s. So this suggests that a seed (the 4 in row 1, column 8) expands vertically downward and possibly horizontally.\n\nBut this is getting too tangled. Maybe the pattern is that any seed cell (a cell not part of a horizontal block) is replaced by a horizontal line in its row, and a vertical line in its column. But the vertical line may be upward or downward depending on the example. \n\nAlternatively, the vertical line is created by extending the seed upward until the top of the grid or another number is hit, and the horizontal line extends left and right until another number is hit.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nLet's take the 1 in row 1 (second row) column 9. This is a seed. Expand horizontally left and right in the row, replacing 2s with 1s until another number is encountered. Since there are only 2s, the entire row becomes 1s. Then, expand vertically upward and downward from column 9, replacing 2s with 1s. But in the input, row 0 is all 2s, so the vertical expansion upward would make column 9 of row 0 a 1. Downward, rows 2,3, etc., in column 9 would become 1s unless there's a different number. But in row 2 of the input, column 9 is 2, so it would become 1. However, the test input's row 2 has a 1 at column 2. So expanding that 1 horizontally would turn row 2 into 1s from column 2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical expansion is done first, then horizontal. \n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I need to look for a simpler pattern. Let's see:\n\nIn all training examples, the output has horizontal or vertical lines added where there were single numbers in the input. For example, a single 4 becomes a horizontal line, a single 8 becomes a vertical line. The direction of the expansion (horizontal or vertical) depends on whether the seed is part of a horizontal block or not.\n\nWait, another observation: in Example 0's output, the single 4 is expanded into a horizontal line. In Example 1's output, the single 8 is expanded into a vertical line. In Example 2, the single 2s are expanded into vertical lines (for the one in the first row) and a horizontal line (for the one in row 6). In Example 3, the 4s are expanded into horizontal lines and vertical lines.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that if a number is alone in its row (not part of a horizontal block), it's expanded horizontally. If it's also alone in its column (not part of a vertical block), it's expanded vertically.\n\nBut in Example 0, the 4 is alone in its row (not part of a horizontal block), so expanded horizontally. There's no vertical expansion because there's a 4 in the same column in the output's row. Wait, but in the input, the 4 is alone in its row and column, so after horizontal expansion, it's part of a horizontal block. Then, since it's alone in the column, it's expanded vertically. But in Example 0's output, the 4 is only in the fourth row, so maybe no vertical expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical expansion is done only if the seed is not part of a horizontal block after expansion. \n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, I'll try to hypothesize the pattern and apply it to the test input.\n\nHypothesis: Any single number in the input (not part of a horizontal block) is expanded horizontally to fill the entire row between the nearest different numbers. Additionally, if after this expansion the number is part of a vertical block (i.e., same number in the same column in adjacent rows), it's expanded vertically to fill between those blocks.\n\nAlternatively, each isolated number in the input (both horizontally and vertically) is expanded into a cross: horizontal line in its row and vertical line in its column.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nThe test input has several 1s that are isolated. For example:\n\n- Row 1, column 9: 1 surrounded by 2s. This would expand horizontally to fill the entire row, making all 2s into 1s in row 1. Then, vertically in column 9, replace all 2s with 1s from row 1 upward and downward until a different number is found. But in the input, row 0 is all 2s, so column 9 in row 0 would become 1. Rows below row 1, column 9: rows 2- etc. have 2s, so they become 1s until a different number is encountered.\n\nAnother 1 in row 2, column 2: expand horizontally in row 2, replacing 2s with 1s between different numbers. Since the row is [2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2], after expansion, the 1 would expand to the left and right until another number. In this case, the row has 2s except for the 1 and another 1 at column 17. So the expansion of the 1 at column 2 would be to fill from column 2 to 17, but there's another 1 at column 17. Wait, but if the expansion is between different numbers, then the 1 at column 2 would expand left and right until a different number is found. But the entire row is 2s except for the two 1s. So expanding the 1 at column 2 would fill all 2s between column 2 and the next non-2, which is column 17 (the other 1). But since the other 1 is also a 1, perhaps the expansion would merge them, creating a horizontal line from column 2 to 17 of 1s. But the output would have to handle this.\n\nBut this is getting complex. Let's look at the test input's 8s. They form a horizontal block in rows 5-10, columns 7-14. These are part of a horizontal block, so they remain unchanged. The 1s in other rows would expand according to the pattern.\n\nSo, applying the pattern:\n\nEach 1 in the test input (which is isolated) would expand horizontally in its row to fill between different numbers and vertically in its column to fill between different numbers.\n\nFor example, the 1 in row 1, column 9: horizontally, expand left and right in row 1 until hitting different numbers. Since the row is all 2s except for this 1, the entire row becomes 1s. Then vertically, column 9 would be filled with 1s from row 0 down to the bottom until a different number is found.\n\nThe 1 in row 2, column 2: expand horizontally in row 2 to fill between different numbers. Since the row has 2s except for the 1s at columns 2 and 17, the expansion would fill from column 2 to 17 with 1s. Then vertically, column 2 would become 1s from row 2 upward and downward.\n\nThe 1 in row 3, column 13: expand horizontally in row 3 to fill between different numbers. Since the row is mostly 2s, this 1 would expand to the entire row, then vertically in column 13.\n\nSimilarly for other 1s.\n\nBut this would lead to a lot of 1s in the output. Looking at the training examples, when a number is expanded horizontally, it replaces the background number in that row. So perhaps in the test input, the 1s would expand horizontally and vertically, replacing 2s with 1s.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input's 8s: since they're part of a horizontal block, they remain unchanged. The 1s would expand into cross shapes.\n\nBut considering the output formats in the examples, sometimes expansion is only horizontal or vertical, not both. For example, Example 1's 8 expands only vertically. Example 0's 4 expands only horizontally.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is: a single number expands in one direction, either horizontal or vertical, depending on the surrounding. For example, if the number is alone in its row, expand horizontally; if alone in its column, expand vertically.\n\nBut this may not always hold. Example 3's 4 in row 5 expands horizontally and the 4 in row 1 expands vertically.\n\nAlternatively, the expansion is both horizontal and vertical, but the examples show only one due to constraints.\n\nIn the test input, the 1s are isolated in both rows and columns. So their expansion would be both horizontal and vertical.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed to craft the output based on this assumption.\n\nThe test input has several 1s:\n\n- Row 1, column 9: expands horizontally to fill the row (all 1s) and vertically in column 9 to fill all rows.\n- Row 2, column 2: expands horizontally to fill between columns 2 and 17 (since there's another 1 at column 17), making row 2's columns 2-17 1s. Then vertically, column 2 becomes 1s.\n- Row 3, column 13: expands horizontally to fill row 3, making it all 1s except where other numbers are. Then vertically, column 13 becomes 1s.\n- Row 7, column 19: expands horizontally in row 7 to fill from column 19 to the end, but since it's at column 19, maybe only that position. Vertically, column 19 becomes 1s.\n- Row 13, column 15: expands horizontally to fill row 13, and vertically in column 15.\n- Row 17, columns 3 and 11: expand horizontally and vertically.\n\nThis would lead to many 1s in the output. However, looking at the training examples, the expansion doesn't always fill the entire row or column. For example, in Example 3's row 5, the 4 expands from column 2 to 6, not the entire row. Because there's a 5 in column 7. So the expansion stops at the next different number.\n\nApplying this to row 1, column 9: the entire row is 2s except for the 1. So the expansion would replace all 2s in the row with 1s. Similarly, vertically, since column 9 is surrounded by 2s, all rows would become 1s in column 9.\n\nBut in the test input's row 5-10, columns 7-14 are 8s. So any vertical expansion in column 9 would stop at row 5, since there's an 8 there. So the vertical expansion for column 9's 1 would be from row 1 down to row 4 (since row 5 has 8s).\n\nSimilarly, row 2, column 2: the expansion horizontally would be from column 2 to 17 (since there's a 1 at column 17). But between columns 2 and 17 in row 2, there's another 1 at column 17. So the expansion would fill all columns between 2 and 17 with 1s. Then vertically, column 2 would expand up and down until a different number is hit. In row 0, column 2 is 2, so it becomes 1. Row 1, column 2 is 2, becomes 1. Row 3, column 2 is 2, becomes 1, and so on until row 4, which is 2. Rows 5-10 have 8s in columns 7-14, so column 2 in those rows are 2s, which would become 1s. But row 9 has a 1 in column 3. Wait, no, row 9 is [2,2,1,2,2,...], so column 2 in row 9 is 1, which would not affect the vertical expansion.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given time constraints, I'll proceed to write the output based on the hypothesis that each isolated 1 expands horizontally in its row to replace all 2s, and vertically in its column to replace all 2s until hitting an 8 or another number.\n\nSo for the test input's 1s:\n\n- Row 1, column 9: entire row becomes 1s. Column 9 becomes 1s from row 0 down to row 4 (since row 5 has 8s).\n- Row 2, column 2: columns 2-17 become 1s. Column 2 becomes 1s from row 0 to row 4 (since row 5 has 8s in column 2? No, row 5's column 2 is 2, so row 5's column 2 becomes 1, and so on until row 10. But row 5's columns 7-14 are 8s, so column 2 is still 2. So vertical expansion in column 2 would replace 2s with 1s from row 2 upwards and downwards until a different number. But there are no other numbers in column 2 except the 1 in row 9. So vertical expansion would fill column 2 with 1s from row 2 up to row 0 and down to row 17, except where there are other numbers. But row 9, column 2 is 1, so that's part of the expansion.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. I'll need to provide an output based on the training examples' patterns, even if it's not perfect.",
