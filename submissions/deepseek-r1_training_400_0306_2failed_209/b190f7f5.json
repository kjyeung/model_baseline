        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the input is a list of lists (rows of numbers), and the output is a larger grid. Let's look at the training examples to see how they transform the input into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput has 3 rows, each with 6 elements. The output is a 9x9 grid. Hmm, wait, the output dimensions are different. Let me check the input and output sizes. Example 0 input is 3x6, output is 9x9. So each input row is transformed into 3 rows in the output? Because 3 input rows multiplied by 3 gives 9 output rows. Similarly, the input columns might be expanded by a factor of 1.5, since 6 becomes 9. Wait, 6 * 1.5 is 9. Maybe each input element is expanded into a 3x3 block?\n\nLooking at the first input row in Example 0: [2, 0, 4, 0, 8, 0]. The output starts with [0,2,0,...] which looks like a 3x3 representation of 2. Then for the next element 0, maybe it's all zeros. Then 4, etc. Let's check.\n\nThe output's first three rows are:\n\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n[2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nThis seems like each number is represented as a 3x3 block. For example, 2 is represented as a cross shape:\n\n0 2 0\n2 2 2\n0 2 0\n\nSimilarly, 4 might be a similar cross but maybe a different pattern. Wait, looking at the next part of the output for 4:\n\nThe next three elements in the input are 0, 8, 0. But the output after the first three rows moves to the next input row. Wait, maybe each input row is transformed into three output rows, but each element in the input becomes a 3x3 block. So for the input row [2,0,4,0,8,0], each element is a 3x3 block arranged horizontally. So each input row becomes three output rows, each of 3*6/2 =9 elements? Wait, 6 elements in input, each taking 3 columns would be 6*3=18 columns, but the output rows are 9 elements long. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, in Example 0, the output is 9x9. So 3 input rows become 9 output rows (3 per input row), and 6 input columns become 9 output columns. So each input element is a 3x3 block but arranged in a way that 6 elements become 9 columns. Wait, maybe the 3x3 blocks are overlapping or arranged differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is split into pairs of elements, and each pair is transformed into a 3x3 block. Let's see: 6 elements per input row. If split into 3 pairs (each pair as two elements), each pair is turned into a 3x3 block. Then 3 pairs * 3 columns per block = 9 columns. Similarly, each input row is split into 3 pairs, and each pair's elements are arranged vertically or horizontally in the 3x3 blocks.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the first input row is [2,0,4,0,8,0]. Let's split into pairs: [2,0], [4,0], [8,0]. Each pair is transformed into a 3x3 block. Let's look at the first three rows of the output. The first three rows of the output correspond to the first input row. The first three output rows are:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,0] \u2192 which could be three 3x3 blocks side by side. Let's split into 3 parts:\n\n0,2,0 | 0,0,0 | 0,4,0 \u2192 Each part is 3 elements, but that's a row. Wait, maybe each 3x3 block is arranged in columns. Hmm, perhaps each pair in the input is represented as a vertical stack of their 3x3 representations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input element is converted into a 3x3 block, and the blocks are arranged in a grid where each row of blocks is placed vertically. Wait, maybe the input rows are transformed into columns of blocks. For example, in Example 0, the input has 3 rows. The output is 9 rows (3x3) and 9 columns. So each input row becomes a column of three 3x3 blocks. But that might not align with the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, the input is a 3x6 grid. Each element is represented as a 3x3 block. So 3 rows become 3*3=9 rows, and 6 columns become 6*3=18 columns, but the output is 9x9. That doesn't fit. So that can't be right.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: a 3x6 input, output 9x9. Example 2's input is 4x8, output 16x16. Wait, no: Example 2's input is 4 rows of 8 elements each, and the output is 16 rows of 16 elements. So the output dimensions are (input rows *4) x (input columns *2). Wait, 4x8 input \u2192 16x16 output. 4*4=16 rows, 8*2=16 columns. Hmm, that's a possible pattern.\n\nWait, for Example 0: 3x6 input \u2192 9x9 output. 3*3=9 rows, 6*1.5=9 columns. But 1.5 is 3/2, so maybe each input row becomes 3 output rows, and each input column becomes 3/2 output columns. But that's not an integer factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input rows are transformed into output rows in a way that each input element is expanded into a 3x3 block, but arranged in a grid where each row of the input becomes three rows in the output, and each element's 3x3 block is placed in such a way that each input element spans three rows and three columns. But then for a 3-row input, 3*3=9 rows. Similarly, columns: if each input element takes 3 columns, then 6 elements would take 18 columns, but the output has 9 columns. So perhaps overlapping or some other arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input element is represented as a 3x3 block, but the blocks are arranged in a grid where the columns of the input are interleaved. For example, each input row is split into two 3-element parts, each forming a 3x3 block stacked vertically. But not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row: [2,0,4,0,8,0]. The output's first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,0 \u2192 maybe three 3x3 blocks side by side. Let's split into 3 blocks of 3 elements each:\n\n[0,2,0], [0,0,0], [0,4,0]. But then each of these would be the first row of their 3x3 block. Then the second row of the output is [2,2,2,0,0,0,4,4,4], which could be the middle row of each 3x3 block. Third row is same as first.\n\nSo each input element's 3x3 block is arranged horizontally, but for the first input row [2,0,4,0,8,0], the non-zero elements are 2,4,8. Their 3x3 blocks are arranged in the output such that each block's three rows are part of the three output rows. But how do the positions correspond?\n\nWait, the first input row has elements at positions 0,2,4. Let's see how they're placed in the output. The first three rows of the output have 2's at columns 1, then 4's at column 7, and 8's? Wait, the first three rows of the output:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\nRow 1: [2,2,2,0,0,0,4,4,4]\nRow 2: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nThen the next three rows correspond to the second input row [0,3,0,8,8,8], which in the output has:\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\nRow 4: [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0]\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nThen rows 6-8 are all zeros, corresponding to the third input row [0,0,0,0,8,0], which maybe the 8's are in the middle. But the output rows 6-8 are all zeros. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps each input row is split into groups of two elements, and each group is represented as a 3x3 block. For example, in Example 0's first input row: [2,0,4,0,8,0]. Split into three pairs: (2,0), (4,0), (8,0). Each pair is transformed into a 3x3 block where the first element is in the top part and the second in the bottom, or something like that. Let's look at the first three rows of the output.\n\nThe first three output rows correspond to the first input row. Let's take the first three rows:\n\nRow 0: 0,2,0 | 0,0,0 | 0,4,0 \u2192 Each section represents a pair (2,0), (4,0), (8,0). The middle of each section in row 1 has 2, 0, 4. Wait, the first section (2,0) in row 0 has 0,2,0; row 1 has 2,2,2; row 2 has 0,2,0. That's the 3x3 cross shape for 2. Then the next section (4,0) in row 0 has 0,0,0; row1 has 0,0,0; row2 has 0,0,0. But 4's block appears later. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, each input element is transformed into a vertical 3x3 block, and arranged in the output. For example, the first input row's 2 would be a vertical column of three 3x3 blocks. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. Input is:\n\n[0,0,8,0,4,0]\n\n[8,0,0,1,2,4]\n\n[8,8,0,0,1,0]\n\nOutput is 9x9. Let's see the first three rows of the output:\n\nRow 0: 0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0\n\nRow 1: 0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 2: 0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0\n\nHmm, these rows correspond to the first input row [0,0,8,0,4,0]. The output's first three rows seem to have 4s in positions that might relate to the 4 in the input. The input has 4 at position 4 (0-based index 4). The output's first three rows have a 4 in the fifth column (index 4) of row 0? Wait, row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0], so the 4 is at index 5. Maybe each input element is transformed into a 3x3 block, and arranged in a grid where each element's block is placed in a way that the position corresponds to (element's index in input row) *3 + some offset. For example, the input element at index 4 (0-based) in the first row (value 4) would be placed starting at column 4*1.5=6? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the input elements are arranged in the output such that each element's 3x3 block is placed in a grid where the columns are grouped in threes. For example, each input column becomes a 3x3 block in the output. But then for 6 columns, 6*3=18 output columns, which doesn't match the 9 columns in Example 0's output. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: look at the numbers. For example, in Example 0's output, the 2's are arranged in a cross pattern. Similarly, the 3's are in a vertical line. The 8's are perhaps represented as full blocks. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the third input row is all zeros except for an 8 in the fifth position. The output's rows 6-8 are all zeros, but maybe the 8 is represented elsewhere. Wait, no. The input's third row is [0,0,0,0,8,0]. The output's rows 6-8 are all zeros. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the input rows are processed in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, the input represents a grid where each number is a certain type of shape, and the output is a larger grid where each number is drawn as that shape. For example, 2 is a cross, 3 is a vertical line, 4 is a diagonal, 8 is a filled square. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the second input row is [0,3,0,8,8,8]. The output rows 3-5 have 3's in a vertical line (rows 3-5, column 4) and 8's as filled squares. For the 3: the middle row (row 4) has [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0], but wait, the vertical line would have three 3's in the same column. But in row 3, the 3 is at column 4, row 4 column 4 is 3, row 5 column 4 is 3. That's a vertical line. Then the 8's in the input are represented as three filled 3x3 blocks. For example, the input row's elements 3, 8,8,8 would have 3 as a vertical line and the 8's as filled squares. But in the output, rows 3-5, columns 6-8: for the input element 8, the output would have a 3x3 block of 8's. Let's check:\n\nLooking at output rows 3-5:\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 3 at column 4 (middle)\nRow 4: [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0] \u2192 3's in columns 3,4,5. Wait, that's a horizontal line. But that contradicts the previous thought. Hmm, maybe the 3 is represented as a horizontal line in the middle row of its 3x3 block. So each input element's 3x3 block has the number represented in a certain pattern. For example:\n\n- 0 is all zeros.\n- 2 is a cross: middle row is all 2's, top and bottom have 2 in the center.\n- 3 is a horizontal line in the middle row.\n- 4 might be a different pattern.\n- 8 is a filled 3x3 block of 8's.\n\nWait in Example 0's output, the input has 8 in the first row's fifth position. Let's see how that's represented. The first input row's fifth element is 8. The output's first three rows would have the 8's block. Looking at the first three rows, the last part of the output rows:\n\nRow0: ...0,4,0 \u2192 columns 6-8 are 0,4,0.\nRow1: ...4,4,4 \u2192 columns 6-8 are 4,4,4.\nRow2: ...0,4,0 \u2192 columns 6-8 are 0,4,0. So this is the 4's block. So the 8 must be elsewhere. Maybe the fifth element in the input row (which is 8) is represented later. Wait, the output in example0 has rows 0-2 for the first input row. Then rows 3-5 for the second input row, which has 8's. So in the second input row, the 8's are in positions 3,4,5. The output's rows 3-5, columns 6-8:\n\nRow3: ...0,0,0]\nRow4: ...0,0,0]\nRow5: ...0,0,0]\n\nWait, no. The output's rows 3-5 for the second input row:\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\nRow4: [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0]\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nThese are for the 3 in the input. Then the 8's in the input's second row (elements 3,4,5: 8,8,8) would be represented in their positions. The input's second row is [0,3,0,8,8,8]. So positions 3,4,5 are 8,8,8. So in the output, each of these 8's would be a filled 3x3 block. Let's see where they are in the output.\n\nLooking at the output rows 3-5, which correspond to the second input row. Each element in the input row is represented as a 3x3 block. For the input element 8 at position 3 (0-based), which would be the fourth element (since the input row is 0:0,1:3,2:0,3:8,4:8,5:8). So the first 8 is at index3. How is this mapped to the output columns?\n\nIf each input element's 3x3 block is placed in a way that each input element corresponds to three columns in the output. For example, input column 0 \u2192 output columns 0-2, input column 1 \u2192 columns 3-5, input column 2 \u2192 6-8, etc. Wait, but Example0's output has 9 columns. For 6 input columns, each input column would take 1.5 output columns. That's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps each input element is represented in a 3x3 block but arranged in a staggered way. Alternatively, the input elements are grouped into pairs, and each pair is represented as a 3x3 block. So for an input row with 6 elements, grouped into 3 pairs (each pair is two elements), each pair is converted into a 3x3 block. Then 3 pairs *3 columns per block=9 columns. That makes sense. So for each pair of input elements (a, b), they are arranged in a 3x3 block where a is in the top row and b in the bottom row, or something like that.\n\nLooking at Example0's first input row: [2,0,4,0,8,0]. Pairs are (2,0), (4,0), (8,0). Let's see how these are represented in the first three output rows.\n\nFor pair (2,0):\n\nThe first three rows of the output's first block (columns 0-2) are:\n\nRow0: 0,2,0\nRow1: 2,2,2\nRow2: 0,2,0 \u2192 this is the 2's cross pattern. The 0 is represented as all zeros. So maybe the first element of the pair is placed as a cross in the top part, and the second element is below. But in this case, the second element is 0, which doesn't show up. Alternatively, perhaps each pair is combined vertically into a 3x3 block. For example, the first element of the pair is the top row of the block, the second is the middle, and the third (but there is none) but maybe zeros. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each pair (a, b) is transformed into a 3x3 block where a is in the top row and b in the bottom row. For example, a cross for a, and maybe a horizontal line for b. But not sure.\n\nLooking at the pair (2,0) in Example0's first input row. The corresponding output block in columns 0-2:\n\nRow0: 0,2,0 \u2192 cross top row\nRow1: 2,2,2 \u2192 cross middle row\nRow2: 0,2,0 \u2192 cross bottom row. So this represents 2. The second element of the pair is 0, which is not represented. So maybe only the first element of the pair is considered. But then why have pairs?\n\nWait, perhaps the pairs are (element i and i+3), but that's for a different arrangement. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the output grids in the examples have a structure where each input row becomes three rows in the output, and each input column becomes three columns. So for example, a 3x6 input becomes 9x18 output. But the examples show that the output is 9x9. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example0, the input is 3x6. Output is 9x9. So 3*3=9 rows, 6*1.5=9 columns. So each input column is 1.5 output columns. How does that work? Maybe each input element is mapped to a 3x3 block, but placed in a way that overlaps columns. For example, every two input elements are mapped into three 3x3 blocks arranged side by side. That could make 6 elements \u2192 9 columns (since 6*1.5=9). For example, every two elements are represented as three columns of 3x3 blocks. But how?\n\nAlternatively, each input element is represented as a 3x3 block, but they are placed in the output with a stride of 2 columns. So each block starts at column 3*i, but overlaps with the next. That might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, the input is split into groups of three elements per row, and each group is transformed into a 3x3 block arranged vertically. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number in the input represents a different pattern in the output, and the output is a combination of all these patterns. For example, 2 creates a cross, 3 creates a vertical line, 8 creates a filled square, etc., and each input element's pattern is placed in the output grid at a position corresponding to its input position, scaled by 3.\n\nSo for instance, input row i, column j corresponds to output rows 3i, 3i+1, 3i+2, and columns 3j, 3j+1, 3j+2. So each input element's pattern is placed in a 3x3 block in the output.\n\nThis seems plausible. Let's check Example0's first input element, which is 2 at (0,0). The output's rows 0-2 and columns 0-2 would be the 3x3 block for 2. Looking at the output:\n\nRow0: 0,2,0, ... \u2192 columns 0-2: [0,2,0]\nRow1: 2,2,2, ... \u2192 columns 0-2: [2,2,2]\nRow2: 0,2,0, ... \u2192 columns 0-2: [0,2,0]\nYes! That's the cross pattern for 2. Then the next element in the first input row is 0 at (0,1). Its 3x3 block would be all zeros, placed at columns 3-5. So in rows 0-2, columns 3-5, it's all zeros, which matches the output.\n\nThe third element in the first input row is 4 at (0,2). Its 3x3 block would be placed at columns 6-8. Let's look at the output's first three rows, columns 6-8:\n\nRow0: 0,4,0 \u2192 columns 6-8: 0,4,0\nRow1: 4,4,4 \u2192 columns 6-8: 4,4,4\nRow2: 0,4,0 \u2192 columns 6-8: 0,4,0. So that's the cross pattern for 4. Then the fourth element is 0, placed at columns 9-11, but wait, the output only has 9 columns, so maybe this isn't possible. Wait, in this case, the input has 6 columns. If each input column is mapped to a 3x3 block in the output columns, then 6 input columns would require 6*3=18 output columns. But the output has 9 columns. So this can't be right. But in Example0's output, the first three rows have 9 columns. So maybe the input columns are grouped into pairs, and each pair is represented as a 3x3 block in the output columns. So for 6 input columns, 3 pairs \u2192 3*3=9 columns. That makes sense.\n\nSo the mapping would be: each pair of input elements (from the same row) is converted into a 3x3 block in the output. The pair is arranged such that the first element is in the top part of the 3x3 block, and the second element is in the bottom part, or something like that.\n\nLooking at Example0's first input row: [2,0,4,0,8,0]. Split into three pairs: (2,0), (4,0), (8,0). Each pair is a 3x3 block. For the first pair (2,0), the 3x3 block is:\n\n0 2 0\n2 2 2\n0 2 0\n\nBut the second element of the pair is 0, so maybe the bottom part is zeros. Wait, no. The entire block is for the first element, 2. The second element of the pair is 0, but how is that represented?\n\nAlternatively, each pair is transformed into a 3x3 block where the first element is the top row, the second is the middle row, and the third row is some combination. But not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps each pair's two elements are placed in the top and bottom rows of the 3x3 block, and the middle row is a combination. For example, the first element is the top row, the second is the bottom row, and the middle row is their sum or something. But looking at Example0's first pair (2,0), the block is:\n\n0 2 0\n2 2 2\n0 2 0\n\nWhich is the cross for 2, and the second element 0 is not present. So maybe the pairs are not used directly, but perhaps each input element is placed in a 3x3 block, but the columns are interleaved. For example, each input element's block is placed every other column. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each input element is represented as a 3x3 block, and these blocks are arranged in a grid where each row of the input is represented as a row of blocks in the output, but the blocks are arranged vertically. For example, each input row becomes three rows in the output, and each input element's block is placed in a column. But with 6 elements per input row, that would require 6 columns of blocks, each 3 rows high. But the output has 9 columns. Hmm.\n\nWait, if each input row is split into two groups of three elements, and each group is arranged as a 3x3 block. For example, a group of three elements [a,b,c] becomes a 3x3 block where each element is a row. So three rows of [a,0,0], [0,b,0], [0,0,c]. But that doesn't match the examples.\n\nAlternatively, each input element is placed in a 3x3 grid in a specific pattern, and the output is a concatenation of these patterns. For example, in Example0's first input row, the elements are 2,0,4,0,8,0. Each of these is a 3x3 block. 2's block is cross-shaped, 0's block is all zeros, 4's block is another cross, etc. Then, when arranged in a row, the output would have the 2's block, then 0's block, then 4's block, etc. But if each element's block is 3 columns, then 6 elements would require 18 columns. But the output has 9 columns. So this suggests that each element's block is 1.5 columns, which isn't possible. So maybe the blocks are overlapped or interleaved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transpose of some operation. For example, the input rows become columns in the output. But not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the output in Example0 has the first three rows corresponding to the first input row, and each input element in the first row is represented as a vertical column in the output. For example, the 2 in the first input row is represented as a vertical cross in the first three rows and first three columns. Then the next element (0) is represented as all zeros in the next three columns (columns 3-5), etc. But then the output would have 6 elements *3 columns each = 18 columns, which again doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me look at another example. Example1's input is:\n\n[0,0,8,0,4,0]\n\n[8,0,0,1,2,4]\n\n[8,8,0,0,1,0]\n\nThe output is a 9x9 grid. Let's take the first input row [0,0,8,0,4,0]. The output's first three rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking at these rows, perhaps the 8 in the third position of the input row is represented in the output. But where? The first three rows of the output have 4's in some positions. The fourth element of the input row is 0, fifth is4, sixth is0. Maybe the fifth element (4) is represented in columns 4-6. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input element is represented as a 3x3 block, but arranged in a way that each input row becomes three rows in the output, and each input column becomes 3 columns. So for example, a 3x6 input becomes 9x18 output. But the examples show that the output is 9x9. So this can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps each input element is mapped to a 3x3 block, and these blocks are then overlapped in some way. For example, each block is shifted by one row and column from the previous. But this would complicate the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a convolution of the input with certain kernels. For example, each number is replaced by a 3x3 kernel. Then the output is the result of placing each kernel at the corresponding position and summing overlapping values. But this might explain why some positions have higher numbers. Looking at Example0's output, the first three rows have 2's and 4's. The input's first row has 2,0,4,0,8,0. If each of these numbers is a kernel, their placement might overlap. For instance, placing a 3x3 kernel for 2 at position (0,0) and 4 at (0,2), but how would they overlap in the output? This might be a possibility. Let's check:\n\nFor the first input row [2,0,4,0,8,0], the output's first three rows have 2's and 4's. If the 2's kernel is placed at position (0,0), and the 4's kernel at (0,2), their kernels would be adjacent but not overlapping. Then the output would have their respective patterns. Similarly, the 8's kernel would be placed further along. But the output has 9 columns. For 6 input elements, each taking 3 columns, it would require 6*3=18 columns, which doesn't fit. So perhaps the kernels are placed with a stride of 1.5 columns, which isn't practical. So this is unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by expanding each input element into a 3x3 block, but then downsampling by taking every other column. For example, each input element's 3x3 block is placed, but then columns are merged. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the test input and see if we can find a pattern. The test input is an 8x4 grid. The output should be 24x12? But the examples show that the output dimensions vary. For example, Example2's input is 4x8, and the output is 16x16. So input rows multiplied by 4 gives output rows, and input columns multiplied by 2 gives output columns. For the test input, 8 rows and 4 columns. 8*2=16 rows, 4*4=16 columns. Wait, no. Example2's input is 4x8, output is 16x16. So 4*4=16 rows, 8*2=16 columns. So perhaps the output rows are input rows multiplied by 4, and columns multiplied by 2. But that doesn't fit the other examples. Example0's input is 3x6, output 9x9. 3*3=9, 6*1.5=9. So no clear multiplier. Maybe the output's rows and columns are each three times the input's rows and columns divided by some factor. This is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as a larger grid where each input element's value is represented as a certain pattern, and these patterns are placed in a way that the rows and columns of the input are expanded. For example, each input row is represented as three rows in the output, and each input column is represented as three columns. So a 3x6 input becomes 9x18 output. But the examples don't match that. So perhaps there's a different expansion factor.\n\nWait, in Example2, input is 4 rows of 8 elements, output is 16 rows and 16 columns. 4*4=16 rows, 8*2=16 columns. So each input row is expanded by 4 rows, and each column by 2 columns. Then for the test input, which is 8 rows and 4 columns, the output should be 8*4=32 rows and 4*2=8 columns. But that doesn't fit the examples. Alternatively, maybe the output dimensions are input rows * some factor and columns * another factor. But this is inconsistent across examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's row count is input rows squared. Example0's 3 input rows \u2192 9 output rows (3\u00b2). Example1's 3 input rows \u21929. Example2's 4 input rows \u219216. Test input has 8 rows \u2192 64 output rows? But the test input's output is not provided, so this is hard to say. But the given examples do fit this pattern. Then the output columns would be input columns squared. Example0's 6 columns \u21929 columns (6 is not a square). Hmm, no. Example1's 6 columns \u21929 output columns (also not a square). So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe the output is constructed by taking each input element and creating a 3x3 block where the number is represented as a certain pattern, and these blocks are arranged in the output such that the input's rows are stacked vertically, and the columns are arranged in a certain way. For example, each input row becomes a block of three rows in the output, and each input column becomes a block of three columns. So a 3x6 input would become 9x18 output. But the examples don't match this. So perhaps the input is processed in a different way.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a combination of all possible pairs of input elements. For example, each element in the input is combined with another to form a 3x3 block. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a magnification of the input where each element is represented as a 3x3 block, but arranged in a grid where each input element is placed in the center of a 3x3 block, and the surrounding cells are filled based on certain rules. For example, the number 2 is represented as a cross, 3 as a vertical line, etc. Then, the output is formed by placing these 3x3 blocks in the same grid positions as the input elements. So each input element (i,j) is placed at (3i+1, 3j+1) in the output, and the surrounding cells are filled based on the number's pattern. This could explain the cross shape for 2.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example0's first element (2 at 0,0). In the output, the center would be at row 1, column 1. The cross would be in rows 0-2 and columns 0-2, centered at (1,1). Then, the cross pattern is:\n\nrow 0, column1:2\n\nrow1, columns 0-2:2,2,2\n\nrow2, column1:2.\n\nWhich matches the first three rows of the output. Then the next element in the input row is 0 at (0,1). Its center is at (1,4) in the output (since each input column is multiplied by 3, but wait, if each input element is spaced by 3 columns, then (0,0) is at (1,1), (0,1) would be at (1,4), (0,2) at (1,7), etc. Then the 3x3 block for (0,1) (which is 0) would be all zeros. So the output's first three rows would have the 2's block at columns 0-2, zeros at 3-5, 4's block at 6-8. Yes, this matches Example0's output. Each input element's 3x3 block is placed with a stride of 3 columns and 3 rows, centered at (3i+1, 3j+1). Then, for example, the first input row is mapped to output rows 1, but since the input has three rows, the output has 3*3=9 rows. Wait, but the input has three rows, each taking 3 output rows. So input row 0 would be output rows 0-2, row1:3-5, row2:6-8. Then each input column is mapped to output columns 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, etc. \n\nSo for input element (i,j), its 3x3 block is placed starting at output row 3i, column 3j. So each input element's block is placed in a 3x3 grid starting at (3i,3j). This way, a 3x6 input would require 9 rows (3*3) and 18 columns (6*3). But the output in Example0 is 9x9. So this doesn't fit. Unless the input columns are grouped into pairs, and each pair's 3x3 blocks are placed side by side. For example, two input columns are merged into three output columns. But how?\n\nThis seems like a dead end. Let's try to think of another pattern. \n\nLooking at Example2's input and output. Input is 4x8, output 16x16. So each input row becomes 4 output rows (4*4=16), and each input column becomes 2 output columns (8*2=16). So for each input element, it's expanded into a 4x2 block in the output. But how does that relate to the numbers?\n\nAlternatively, each input element is represented as a 4x4 block in the output. But 4x8 input would be 16x32 output, but the output is 16x16. So perhaps each input column is expanded into 2 columns. So each input element becomes a 4x2 block. For example, the number 2 would be a certain pattern in a 4x2 block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by duplicating each input row four times and each input column twice. For example, each input row is repeated four times in the output, and each input column is repeated twice. But this would result in a 4*4=16 rows and 8*2=16 columns. However, the output's content would have repeated values, which is not the case in Example2. For instance, the output of Example2 has varying values, not just duplicates of the input.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's try to look for a different pattern in the numbers. \n\nIn Example0's input, the second row is [0,3,0,8,8,8]. The output's rows 3-5 show a 3 in the middle and 8's represented as filled 3x3 blocks. For the 3 in input (row1, column1), the output's rows3-5, columns3-5 (assuming each input element is a 3x3 block):\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column4 is 3.\nRow4: [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0] \u2192 columns3-5 are 3's.\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column4 is 3.\n\nSo this forms a cross for 3, but centered in the middle. Wait, no. The rows3-5 for columns3-5 show a vertical line in column4. But row4 has 3's in columns3-5. So it's a horizontal line for 3. That contradicts the cross hypothesis. So maybe each number has a different pattern. For example:\n\n- 2: cross (middle row all 2's, and middle column all 2's)\n- 3: horizontal line (middle row all 3's)\n- 4: vertical line (middle column all 4's)\n- 8: filled square (all 8's in the 3x3 block)\n- 0: all zeros.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example0's output:\n\nIn the second input row, the elements are [0,3,0,8,8,8]. The first three elements are 0,3,0. So their blocks are:\n\n0: all zeros.\n3: horizontal line in middle row (row4: [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0])\n8: filled square.\n\nFor the third element (0) in the input row, its block is all zeros. The fourth, fifth, sixth elements are 8,8,8. Their blocks would be filled squares. So in the output rows3-5, columns6-8 would be filled with 8's. Let's check:\n\nRow3: ...0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 No, columns6-8 are 0,0,0. But the input's fourth element is 8, which should be at columns6-8. So this contradicts. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the input elements are mapped to the output in a way that each input column is expanded into three output columns, but the input rows are expanded into three output rows. For example, each input element (i,j) is a 3x3 block starting at (3i,3j) in the output. But then for Example0's input (3x6), the output would be 9 rows and 18 columns, which doesn't match the 9x9 output.\n\nSo perhaps the input columns are compressed. For example, each pair of input elements in a row is represented as a single 3x3 block in the output. So for a row with six elements, three pairs are formed, each converted to a 3x3 block. Then, each pair's block is placed in three columns of the output. So 3 pairs \u00d73 columns =9 columns. This fits Example0's 9 columns.\n\nSo, for each pair of input elements (a, b), they are combined into a 3x3 block where a and b are arranged in some way. Let's see how this works with Example0's first pair (2,0):\n\nThe output's first three rows, columns0-2 are:\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 2 2\n\n0 2 0\n\nWhich is the cross pattern for 2. The second element of the pair is 0, which may not contribute. Then the next pair is (4,0), which would have a cross of 4:\n\n0 4 0\n\n4 4 4\n\n0 4 0\n\nBut in the output's first three rows, columns3-5 are all zeros. So this doesn't fit. Wait, but the first pair is (2,0), and the second pair is (4,0). The output's columns3-5 are all zeros. So perhaps only the first element of the pair is used. But then why have pairs?\n\nAlternatively, each pair is merged into a single 3x3 block where the two numbers are combined. For example, the first element is the top part, and the second is the bottom part. But how?\n\nAlternatively, each pair's elements are arranged vertically in the 3x3 block. For example, the first element is placed in the top row, the second in the bottom row, and the middle row is a combination. For example, a pair (a,b) would have a cross of a in the top three rows and a cross of b in the bottom three rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the pair is transformed into a 3x3 block where the first element is the vertical component and the second is the horizontal. For example, a cross where the vertical line is a and the horizontal line is b. For example, a pair (2,3) would have a cross with vertical 2 and horizontal 3. But in Example0's first pair (2,0), the horizontal line is 0, so only the vertical 2 remains. This matches the cross pattern for 2. The second pair (4,0) would have vertical 4 and horizontal 0, resulting in a vertical line of 4. But in the output, the first three rows' columns6-8 are 0,4,0; 4,4,4; 0,4,0, which is a cross. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's try to think of the output as a combination of vertical and horizontal expansions. For example, each input row is expanded into three rows in the output, and each input column into three columns. But the input's row and column counts would multiply by three. So 3x6 input becomes 9x18 output. But the output is 9x9, so perhaps the input columns are divided by two. So 6 columns become 3 groups of two, each group forming a 3x3 block. So for each group of two columns in the input row, create a 3x3 block in the output row. So each input row has 6 elements \u2192 3 groups of two elements \u2192 each group forms a 3x3 block. Then, each input row becomes three output rows, and each group of two input elements becomes three output columns. So 6 elements \u2192 3*3=9 columns.\n\nThis fits Example0's 3x6 input \u2192 9x9 output. Let's check.\n\nFor Example0's first input row: [2,0,4,0,8,0]. Grouped into three pairs: (2,0), (4,0), (8,0). Each pair is transformed into a 3x3 block. The first pair (2,0) becomes:\n\nRow0: 0 2 0 \u2192 cross for 2\nRow1: 2 2 2\nRow2: 0 2 0\n\nBut since the second element is 0, maybe it's ignored. So the first pair's block is the cross for 2. Then the next pair (4,0) becomes the cross for 4. The third pair (8,0) becomes the cross for 8. \n\nBut in the output's first three rows, the third block (columns6-8) is 0,4,0; 4,4,4; 0,4,0 \u2192 which is a cross for 4, not 8. So this doesn't fit. The input's third pair is (8,0), which should be a cross for 8. But the output's first three rows for columns6-8 show 4's cross. This is a discrepancy.\n\nWait, but the first input row's elements are [2,0,4,0,8,0]. The first pair is (2,0), second (4,0), third (8,0). So their blocks should be for 2,4,8. But in the output's first three rows, the blocks are 2, 0, 4. So this doesn't align. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to look for another pattern. \n\nIn Example0's output, the non-zero numbers in the output are the same as those in the input. The positions where they appear in the output seem to be related to their positions in the input. For example, the 2 in the first input row (position0) appears in the top-left block. The 3 in the second input row (position1) appears in the middle block. The 8's in the second input row's positions3-5 appear as filled blocks in the output's middle-right area. \n\nWait, in Example0's second input row, the 3 is at position1. The output's rows3-5, columns3-5:\n\nRow3: 0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0 \u2192 3 is at column4.\nRow4: 0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0 \u2192 3's in columns3-5.\nRow5: 0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0 \u2192 3 at column4.\n\nSo this forms a horizontal line for 3, centered in the middle of the block. So perhaps each number's pattern is determined by its value, and the block is centered at a position corresponding to the input's row and column. For example, input element (i,j) is centered at (3i+1, 3j+1) in the output. Then, the 3x3 block for that element is placed around that center.\n\nFor Example0's first input element (0,0) with value 2: the center is at (1,1). So the cross is placed there. The 3 in the second row, column1, would be centered at (4,4). The output's rows3-5 and columns3-5 are centered at (4,4), and the horizontal line is there. \n\nThis seems to fit. Each input element (i,j) is represented as a 3x3 block centered at (3i+1, 3j+1) in the output. The pattern depends on the number:\n\n- 2: cross (middle row and column filled)\n- 3: horizontal line (middle row filled)\n- 4: vertical line (middle column filled)\n- 8: filled square (all cells filled)\n- 0: empty.\n\nLet's verify this with Example0's input:\n\nFirst input row is [2,0,4,0,8,0]. The elements are at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5).\n\n- 2 at (0,0): centered at (1,1). Cross pattern in rows0-2, columns0-2.\n- 0 at (0,1): no pattern.\n- 4 at (0,2): vertical line centered at (1,7). So columns6-8, rows0-2. The vertical line would have 4's in column7. Looking at the output's first three rows, columns6-8: 0,4,0 in row0; 4,4,4 in row1; 0,4,0 in row2. That's a cross, not a vertical line. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm, maybe the patterns are different. For 4, maybe it's a cross as well, but with a different number. But why is 4's pattern also a cross?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern for each number is as follows:\n\n- 0: all zeros.\n- Non-zero numbers: a cross of that number. The cross consists of the middle row and middle column of the 3x3 block filled with the number.\n\nSo for 2, it's a cross, 3 also a cross, etc. But in Example0's second input row, the 3 is represented as a horizontal line. Wait, no. For the 3 in Example0's second row, the output has a horizontal line in the middle row of its block. So that's a horizontal line, not a cross. So the pattern varies by number.\n\nThis suggests that each number has a unique pattern:\n\n- 2: cross\n- 3: horizontal line\n- 4: vertical line\n- 8: filled square\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample0's first input row's 4: centered at (1,7). So the 3x3 block for 4 should be a vertical line (middle column). But the output shows a cross. So this contradicts.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to look at the test input and see if we can apply any observed patterns.\n\nTest input:\n\n[3,0,0,1]\n[0,2,2,0]\n[0,2,2,0]\n[3,0,0,3]\n[0,8,8,0]\n[8,8,8,8]\n[8,0,0,8]\n[8,8,8,8]\n\nExpected output: ? \n\nAssuming each input element is represented as a 3x3 block, and each input row becomes three output rows. For example, the test input has 8 rows, so the output would have 8*3=24 rows. But the examples show that the output's row count is input rows multiplied by a certain factor. Example2's input is 4 rows, output 16 rows. So 4*4=16. For the test input, 8 rows \u2192 32 rows. But Example0's input is 3 rows \u21929 rows (3*3), Example1's 3 rows \u21929. So the pattern is input_rows *3 \u2192 output_rows. But Example2's input rows 4 \u2192 output 16 rows (4*4). So inconsistency here. \n\nAlternatively, the output rows are input_rows squared. Example0:3\u21929 (3\u00b2), Example1:3\u21929, Example2:4\u219216 (4\u00b2). Test input has 8 rows \u219264 rows. But that's a lot. However, the test output is not provided, so perhaps the pattern is that each input row is replicated three times, but that doesn't fit Example2's case.\n\nAlternatively, each input row is transformed into a number of rows equal to the maximum number in that row. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, each input row is transformed into a number of rows equal to the sum of its elements. But again, not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll try to formulate a possible pattern based on the examples.\n\nFrom Example0 and Example1, it seems that each input row is transformed into three output rows, and each input element is represented as a 3x3 block. The blocks are arranged in a way that each input element's block is placed in the output such that their positions are scaled by 3. For example, input element (i,j) is represented in the output's rows 3i to 3i+2 and columns 3j to 3j+2. The content of the block depends on the number:\n\n- 0: all zeros.\n- 2: cross (middle row and column filled).\n- 3: horizontal line (middle row filled).\n- 4: vertical line (middle column filled).\n- 8: filled block.\n\nBut in Example0, the input's third element in the first row is 4, which would be represented as a vertical line. But the output shows a cross. So this contradicts. Therefore, perhaps all non-zero numbers are represented as a cross. But Example0's second row has 3, which is a horizontal line in the output. So that's not.\n\nAlternative approach: the number determines the number of layers in the cross. For example, 2 has a cross of 2's, 3 has three layers, but this is not evident.\n\nAlternatively, the number indicates the number of rows to fill. For example, 2 fills two rows, but this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that each non-zero number is represented as a cross in its 3x3 block, and the input rows are expanded into three output rows each, and columns into three columns. Even though this doesn't fit all examples, perhaps it's the intended pattern.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nEach input row is three output rows. Test input has 8 rows \u2192 24 output rows. Each input column is three output columns. Test input has 4 columns \u219212 output columns. So the output should be 24x12.\n\nBut looking at Example2's input (4x8) \u2192 output 16x16. So this approach doesn't fit. So perhaps the expansion factor is different.\n\nAlternatively, each input element is represented as a 3x3 block, and the output's rows are input_rows *3 and columns input_cols *3. For the test input, 8 rows *3=24, 4 cols *3=12. But the examples don't fit. Example0's input is 3x6 \u21929x18, but the output is 9x9. So perhaps each input column is grouped into pairs, each pair becoming a 3x3 block. So 6 columns \u21923 pairs \u21923*3=9 columns. \n\nSo for the test input's 4 columns \u2192 2 pairs \u2192 2*3=6 columns. But the output examples don't fit this either.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to look at Example2's input and output to see if there's a pattern. Example2's input is a 4x8 grid. The output is 16x16. So each input row becomes 4 output rows (4*4=16), and each input column becomes 2 output columns (8*2=16). So expansion factors are rows \u00d74 and columns \u00d72.\n\nFor each input element, it's represented as a 4x2 block in the output. But how?\n\nLooking at Example2's input row 0: [2,0,0,4,0,0,8,0]. The output's first four rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\nRow1: [2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4]\nRow2: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\nRow3: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nEach of these rows corresponds to input row 0. The numbers 2,4,8 are represented. The 2 is in columns 2-5 (four columns?), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each input element is expanded into a 4x2 block. For example, 2 is represented as:\n\n0 0 2 0\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 0 2 0\n\nWhich is a vertical line in the third column, with the middle two rows filled with 2's. But this doesn't match the output.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn the test input, the first few rows are:\n\n[3,0,0,1]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[3,0,0,3]\n\nEach row has 4 elements. Looking at Example2's input (4x8) which became 16x16 output, perhaps each input row becomes 4 output rows, and each element becomes a 4x4 block. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, each input element is represented as a 2x2 block in the output. For example, 3 becomes a 2x2 block of 3's. But this doesn't explain the examples.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output is generated by expanding each input element into a square block where the size of the block corresponds to the number. For example, 3 becomes a 3x3 block, but this is not observed in the examples.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to hypothesize that the output is generated by expanding each input element into a 3x3 block with a cross pattern for non-zero numbers, and the test input's output would follow this pattern. But given the previous examples, especially Example2, this seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a sum of the input elements' contributions, each placed in their respective positions. For example, each input element contributes to the output based on its value and position.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, I'm struggling. Given the examples, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on Example0 and Example1, each input element is represented as a 3x3 block, and the output is formed by arranging these blocks in a grid where each input row becomes three output rows and each input column becomes three output columns. Each non-zero number is represented as a cross in its block. For example, 3 would be a cross of 3's. However, in Example0's second row, the 3 is represented as a horizontal line. This contradicts the cross pattern. \n\nGiven the time I've invested and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the following approach for the test input:\n\nEach input element is represented as a 3x3 block. The pattern for each number is:\n\n- 0: all zeros.\n- 1: cross.\n- 2: cross.\n- 3: cross.\n- 8: filled square.\n\nEach input row becomes three output rows, and each input column becomes three output columns.\n\nThus, for the test input with 8 rows and 4 columns, the output would be 24 rows and 12 columns. Each input element (i,j) is represented as a 3x3 block starting at (3i, 3j).\n\nSo let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest input first row: [3,0,0,1]\n\nEach element:\n\n3: cross in its block.\n\n0: all zeros.\n\n0: all zeros.\n\n1: cross.\n\nSo the first three output rows would be:\n\nFor 3 (0,0):\n\nRow0: 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n\nRow1: 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n\nRow2: 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n\nBut this is speculative. Additionally, the other rows would follow similarly. However, this approach might not match the examples, especially Example0's 3 being a horizontal line.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed to format the test input's output based on the cross pattern for non-zero numbers and filled squares for 8's. Each input row becomes three output rows, each element a 3x3 block. \n\nFor the test input's 8's rows:\n\n[0,8,8,0] \u2192 each 8 is a filled 3x3 block.\n\n[8,8,8,8] \u2192 all filled blocks.\n\n[8,0,0,8] \u2192 filled blocks at first and fourth positions.\n\n[8,8,8,8] \u2192 all filled.\n\nSo the output would have these blocks filled with 8's.\n\nFor the rows with 2's:\n\n[0,2,2,0] \u2192 cross blocks for each 2.\n\nThus, the output for the test input would be a series of 3x3 blocks arranged according to the input elements, with non-zero numbers represented as crosses or filled squares. However, given the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll provide a possible output based on this pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by analyzing the examples given.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nInput has three rows:\n[2, 0, 4, 0, 8, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 8, 8, 8]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nThe output is a 9x9 grid. Wait, the input rows have 6 elements each, and the output is 9 rows of 9 elements. Hmm. Let me see. The output in Example 0 has 9 rows. Each row in the output seems to be related to the input numbers, but how?\n\nLooking at the first input row [2,0,4,0,8,0]. The output's first three rows have 2s, then 0s, then 4s. Wait, maybe each element in the input row is being transformed into a 3x3 block. For example, the first element 2 in the input might become a 3x3 block where the center is 2? Or perhaps some arrangement. Let me check.\n\nThe first input row is [2,0,4,0,8,0]. The output's first three rows are:\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n[2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nWait, breaking this down into parts. Each of these three rows seems to correspond to the elements in the input row. Let's see: the first three elements in the output (columns 0-2) are arranged in a way that when you look at them as a 3x3 grid, maybe 2 is represented as a cross. Like, in the first three rows of the output, the first element 2 is represented as a cross: middle of the 3x3 block. Wait, the first element 2 in the input row might be represented as a cross in a 3x3 block. Let's see:\n\nThe first part of the output for the first input row is [0,2,0] in the first row, then [2,2,2], then [0,2,0]. That looks like a vertical line with a horizontal line crossing it, forming a plus sign. So the number 2 is represented as a plus-shaped 3x3 block where the center is 2, and the surrounding in the cross is 2 as well. Wait, but in the output, the first three elements for the first input element (2) are:\n\nRow 0: 0,2,0\nRow 1: 2,2,2\nRow 2: 0,2,0\n\nThat's a cross. Then, next in the input row is 0. So maybe 0s are represented as 3x3 blocks of zeros. Then comes 4 in the input. The next part of the output for the first input row is 0,0,0 (columns 3-5?), but wait the output row 0 has [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]. Wait, maybe each input element is converted into a 3x3 block, and these blocks are placed side by side. Let's check.\n\nThe first input row has 6 elements. If each is a 3x3 block, then 6 elements would take 6*3=18 columns, but the output has 9 columns. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe each input row is transformed into three rows in the output, with each element in the input row being expanded into three columns. But that doesn't fit either. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the input for Example 0 has three rows of 6 elements each, and the output is 9 rows (3*3) of 9 elements (3*3 * 3? Not sure). Wait, maybe each input row is split into pairs, and each pair is processed into a 3x3 block. For instance, the first input row is [2,0,4,0,8,0], which could be split into three pairs: (2,0), (4,0), (8,0). Then each pair is transformed into a 3x3 block, and the blocks are arranged vertically? But then each input row would generate three rows of 3 blocks, which would be 9 columns. But the output has 9 rows and 9 columns. So perhaps each input row is split into pairs, and each pair is converted into a 3x3 block, and these blocks are stacked vertically for each row. Then three input rows would generate 3*3=9 rows. But how about the columns?\n\nWait, for Example 0, each input row is 6 elements. Split into three pairs (since 6/2=3). Each pair (a, b) becomes a 3x3 block. Then each input row contributes 3 blocks (3x3 each) arranged horizontally? But that would make 3*3=9 columns. So each input row would become 3 rows (since each block is 3 rows) but arranged vertically. Wait, but that would require that each input row's three blocks are arranged vertically. So three input rows would lead to 3*3=9 output rows. And each block is 3 columns wide, so 3*3=9 columns. That makes sense.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each pair of numbers in the input row, create a 3x3 block based on those two numbers, and arrange these blocks vertically. Then the input rows are processed into output rows by stacking the blocks vertically. Let's test this with Example 0.\n\nFirst input row: [2,0,4,0,8,0]. Split into pairs: (2,0), (4,0), (8,0). Each pair (a,b) is transformed into a 3x3 block. Let's see how the first pair (2,0) becomes the first 3 rows of the output. The first three rows of the output are:\n\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n[2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nWait, the first three columns (0-2) are for the first pair (2,0). Let's see. The first block (from pair (2,0)) is:\n\nRow 0: 0,2,0\nRow 1: 2,2,2\nRow 2: 0,2,0\n\nThat's the cross shape again. Then the next pair (4,0) would be columns 3-5. But columns 3-5 in the first three rows are all 0s. Then the third pair (8,0) is columns 6-8. In the first three rows, the third block (columns 6-8) has 0,4,0. Wait, but the pair is (8,0). That doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the pairs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the input is processed as a single number, but considering the row and column positions. Wait, perhaps each element in the input is mapped to a 3x3 block, and the blocks are arranged in a grid. For example, in Example 0, the input has 3 rows, each with 6 elements. So each element's block is arranged such that each input row becomes 3 rows in the output, and each input column becomes 3 columns. So input rows:3x6 \u2192 output rows:3*3=9, output columns:6*3=18? But the output has 9 columns. So this approach is not directly matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is being transformed into a larger grid where each original element is replaced by a 3x3 block, but then some overlapping or merging occurs. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. Input has three rows of 6 elements each, output is 9 rows of 9 elements. For example, the output for Example 1 has three sections. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first row is [0,0,8,0,4,0]. The output's first three rows are:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm, perhaps each input element is being converted into a 3x3 block, but the arrangement is such that each input row is split into two parts, and each part is arranged in a certain way. Alternatively, maybe the input elements are grouped in a way that each group of two elements (from different rows?) forms a 3x3 block.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each non-zero element in the input is creating a cross-shaped 3x3 block in the output, with the value of the element, and the position in the output grid is scaled by a factor. For example, input row i, column j would correspond to output row 3i + 1, column 3j + 1. Then the cross is centered there, and the surrounding cells are filled with the same value. But zeros in the input are left as zeros. Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's first input element: 2 at (0,0). The output's center would be at (1,1) (since 3*0+1=1 row, 3*0+1=1 column). The cross would be (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (0,1), (2,1). Let's check the output:\n\nRow 0 (index 0) has [0,2,0, ...]. So columns 0-2: 0,2,0. Then row 1 has [2,2,2, ...], so columns 0-2: 2,2,2. Row 2 has 0,2,0. So that's a cross. Yes. Then the next element in the input is 0 at (0,1). Since it's zero, the corresponding 3x3 block would be all zeros. Then next element is 4 at (0,2). Its cross would be centered at (1, 3*2+1=7). Wait, 3j+1: j=2 \u2192 7. So columns 7-9? But the output row 0 has ...0,4,0. Wait, in row 0, the fourth element (columns 3-5) are zeros. The third element in input row 0 is 4 (j=2). So 3*2=6, so columns 6,7,8. Looking at output row 0, the columns 6-8 are 0,4,0. Row 1 columns 6-8 are 4,4,4. Row 2 columns 6-8 are 0,4,0. So yes, that's a cross for 4. Then the next element is 0, which would leave zeros. Then 8 at (0,4). j=4. 3*4=12, but the output has only 9 columns, so this can't be right. Wait, this approach works for the first few elements but then runs into column count issues. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input element is expanded into a 3x3 block, but the output grid's size depends on the input. For example, each input row of N elements becomes 3 rows, and each element becomes 3 columns. So for input rows of 6 elements, the output columns would be 6*3=18. But the examples have output columns as 9. So maybe each input row is split into pairs, and each pair is processed into a 3x3 block. So 6 elements \u2192 3 pairs \u2192 3*3=9 columns. And each input row becomes 3 output rows. Then for 3 input rows, we have 3*3=9 output rows, which matches the examples.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b) in the input row, create a 3x3 block. Let's see how the pairs are converted.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row: [2,0,4,0,8,0]. Split into pairs: (2,0), (4,0), (8,0). The first three rows of the output correspond to this first input row. Let's look at the first three rows of the output:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,0, 0,0,0, 0,4,0] \u2192 for the first pair (2,0), middle element is 2; the second pair (4,0) is 0s except middle 4; third pair (8,0) is 0s except middle 4? Wait, no. Wait the third pair is (8,0), but in the output, the third part is 0,4,0. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe the pair is (a, b), and the block is a combination of a and b.\n\nWait, in the first pair (2,0) of Example 0, the output's first three columns (columns 0-2) are:\n\nRow 0: 0,2,0\n\nRow 1: 2,2,2\n\nRow 2: 0,2,0\n\nThat's a cross for 2. Then the second pair (4,0) would be columns 3-5. In these columns, all rows are 0 except in the third pair's output. Wait, no, in row 0, columns 3-5 are 0,0,0. Row 1, columns 3-5 are 0,0,0. Row 2, same. But the third pair (8,0) in columns 6-8 has row 0: 0,4,0. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pairs are (a, b) where a and b are arranged in the 3x3 block. For example, a could be the top, b the bottom, or a cross. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each input row is a 3x3 grid per element, but arranged in a way that each element's block is placed in a grid. For example, each input element is represented as a 3x3 block, and they are arranged in a grid where each input row becomes a 3x3 grid of blocks, making the output rows and columns 3 times the input. But the input rows are 6 elements, and the output rows are 9. So 6 elements would not fit into a 3x3 grid of blocks. Unless the input is arranged in a 2x3 grid and each element's block is 3x3, leading to 6x9 output. But the examples have 9x9 outputs. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. Input has four rows of 8 elements each. The output is 16 rows of 16 elements. Wait, 4 input rows \u2192 16 output rows (4*4?), and 8 elements \u2192 16 columns (8*2?). Hmm. Wait, Example 2's input has four rows, each with 8 elements. The output is 16 rows (4*4) and 16 columns (8*2). But this seems inconsistent with the earlier examples. For Example 0, 3 input rows \u21929 output rows (3*3), and 6 input columns \u21929 output columns (3*3). So perhaps each input row's length is multiplied by 1.5 to get the output columns. 6 \u21929 (6*1.5=9), 8 \u219212 (but Example 2's output has 16 columns). Wait, maybe this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input element is transformed into a square of size (n x n) where n depends on something else. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output. The input rows are three rows of six elements. The output is nine rows of nine elements. Let's look at how the numbers are arranged. For instance, in Example 1's input, the first row is [0,0,8,0,4,0]. The output's first three rows have 4s and 1s. Let's track where 8 comes in. The third element in the input's first row is 8. In the output, maybe the 8 is transformed into a cross of 4s. Wait, in Example 1's output, the first three rows have 4s in positions related to the third element (8) and fifth element (4) of the input row. Hmm, maybe each number is divided by 2 and then arranged as a cross. For example, 8 becomes 4, and 4 becomes 2, but in Example 0, the input has 2, and the output has 2 in the cross. So 2 stays 2. Hmm, maybe the number is preserved, but placed in a cross shape in the 3x3 block. But then in Example 0's first pair, 2 is in a cross, and the 8 is transformed into a 4 cross. So perhaps the input number is divided by 2 for each level of depth in the output. Alternatively, maybe there's a different transformation.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input row, the first element is 2. The output cross is all 2s. Then there's an 8 in the input, and in the output, the cross for 8 is 4s. So 8 becomes 4. So perhaps each number is divided by 2 when placed in the output. Similarly, in Example 1's input, the third element is 8. In the output, the corresponding block has 4s. So 8/2=4. Then 4 in the input becomes 2. For example, in Example 1's input, fifth element is 4. The corresponding block in the output is 2. So the value is halved.\n\nBut how does this fit with other elements? For instance, Example 1's input has 1 and 2. In the output, there are 1s and 2s. So perhaps only even numbers are divided by 2, and odd numbers remain the same. Or maybe it's divided by 2 for each step of expansion. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's input has 2, which is halved once (if any), but in the output, the cross is 2s, so maybe not. Wait, maybe the number is not divided but placed as-is. Then why does 8 in Example 0 become 4 in the output? Because in Example 0's input row has 8 in the fifth position (input row 0: [2,0,4,0,8,0]). The corresponding output block for this 8 would be columns 6-8. In row 0, columns 6-8 are 0,4,0. Row 1, columns 6-8 are 4,4,4. Row 2: 0,4,0. So the cross is 4s. So 8 in input is transformed into 4 in the output. So 8/2=4. Similarly, in Example 1's input, 8 becomes 4. The input 4 becomes 2. So the pattern is that each input number is divided by 2 in the output. But then why in Example 0's first input element, 2, becomes 2 in the output. 2/2=1, but it's still 2. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number is shifted in a different way. Maybe the output value is the input value divided by 2^k, where k is the level of expansion. For instance, if the input is processed into a 3x3 block, then each subsequent expansion divides by 2. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output blocks are created by creating a cross where the center is the original value, and the surrounding cross elements are half of that value. Wait, but in Example 0's first block, the cross is all 2s, which would suggest no division. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input value is placed in the center of the 3x3 block, and the surrounding cross (up, down, left, right) are the same value. Then, for 2, it's all 2s. For 8, it's 8 in the cross. But in Example 0's output, the 8 in the input is represented as 4 in the cross. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps there's a step where the value is halved each time it's expanded.\n\nAnother approach: Let's track where the numbers come from. In Example 0's input:\n\nFirst row: [2,0,4,0,8,0]\n\nThe first three output rows have 2s and 4s. The second three rows correspond to the second input row: [0,3,0,8,8,8], and the output rows 3-5 have 3s. The third three rows correspond to the third input row, which has 8s, but in the output, rows 6-8 are all zeros. Wait, the third input row is [0,0,0,0,8,0]. The corresponding output rows are all zeros except for the 8, which becomes 4 in the cross. But the output rows 6-8 are all zeros. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input row is transformed into three output rows. For example, each element in the input row is expanded into three columns. So for an input row of 6 elements, 6*3=18 columns, but the output has 9 columns. So maybe each input element is expanded into 1.5 columns, which is not possible. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the output structure for Example 0. The first three rows have non-zero values only in the first and third blocks. The middle block (columns 3-5) are all zeros. The first block is for 2, the third block for 4, and the fifth block for 8. Wait, perhaps the input elements are being arranged in a staggered manner. For example, each input row is split into two parts, and interleaved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input rows are being processed in such a way that each element's 3x3 block is placed in a grid that combines all input elements. But I'm stuck. Let's look at another example.\n\nExample 2's input has four rows of eight elements. The output is 16 rows of 16 elements. So each input row is transformed into four output rows (since 4 input rows \u2192 16 output rows, 4*4). Each input element is transformed into a 4x4 block? No, because 8 elements \u219216 columns (8*2). So each input element is transformed into a 2x2 block. Let's check.\n\nFor Example 2's input, first row is [2,0,0,4,0,0,8,0]. The output's first four rows are:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\nRow 1: [2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4]\nRow 2: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\nRow 3: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nLooking at the first four elements of the input's first row: 2,0,0,4. The first part of the output's first four rows has 2s and 4s. Each input element is turned into a 4x4 block? Not sure. Alternatively, each input element is part of a pair, and each pair becomes a 4x4 block. For example, input elements [2,0] \u2192 first 4x4 block. But it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, in Example 2, the output has a pattern where the numbers are mirrored. For example, in the first 4 rows of the output, there's 2 and 4, and later rows have 4 and 2. This suggests some kind of reflection. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern that can be applied to all examples.\n\nAlternative approach: For each input number, create a cross in the output. The position of the cross in the output depends on the input's position, and the size of the cross depends on the input number. For example, a larger number creates a larger cross. Wait, but the output's cross seems to be 3x3 for each number, regardless of the value. So maybe the value is placed in the center of a 3x3 cross, and the other positions are the same value. But in Example 0's first input element 2, the cross is 3x3. The input number 8 is represented as 4 in the cross. So perhaps the number is divided by 2 each time it's placed. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the output cross's value is the input value divided by 2^k, where k is the number of layers. But this is vague.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nInput row 0: [0,0,8,0,4,0]\n\nOutput for this row's first three rows have 4s (from 8/2=4) and 2s (from 4/2=2). So maybe each time the number is placed in the output, it's halved. So 8 becomes 4, 4 becomes 2, 2 remains 2 (if halved again, it would be 1, but that's not the case in Example 0). Hmm, this inconsistency makes it unclear.\n\nAnother observation: The output grids seem to have a structure where each input row is represented as a group of three rows in the output, and each input column is represented as a group of three columns. For example, in Example 0, the first input row has 6 elements. The output has 9 columns (3 columns per input element). So each input element is mapped to a 3x3 block in the output. Let's assume that each input element is placed in the center of a 3x3 block, and the surrounding cells are filled with the same value. But this doesn't fit because in Example 0's input row, the first element is 2, and the output's first 3x3 block is:\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 2 2\n\n0 2 0\n\nWhich is a cross. So the value is placed in the center and the cross around it. Then, the 0 elements in the input are left as all zeros in their 3x3 blocks.\n\nNow, how are the values determined for non-zero elements? For instance, in Example 0's first input element is 2. The cross in the output is 2s. The third element is 4. The cross in the output is 4s. The fifth element is 8. The cross in the output is 4s. Wait, 8 is halved to 4. But why? Maybe each time you move to a deeper layer, the value is halved. But how does that apply?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is a grid where each element represents a value that is split into lower levels. For example, the input is the top layer, and each layer below it represents values divided by 2. But the output seems to have multiple layers. For instance, Example 0's input has 3 rows, output has 9 rows. Maybe each input row is split into three layers, and each layer is a downscaled version.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to think of another way.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking each element in the input and creating a 3x3 cross, with the original value in the center and the value divided by 2 in the cross arms. But in Example 0, the cross for 2 is all 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the cross arms are the same as the center value. For example, 2 in the input becomes a cross of 2s. But then why does 8 in the input become 4s? Maybe because the cross is two layers deep. For example, each time you create a cross for a number, it's divided by 2. So an input of 8 would create a cross of 4s, and then perhaps another layer would create 2s, etc. But in Example 0's first input row, the 8's cross is 4s, but there's no further layers. So this might not be the case.\n\nLet's look at the Test Input and see if we can find a pattern that could apply to it.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[3,0,0,1]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[0,2,2,0]\n\n[3,0,0,3]\n\n[0,8,8,0]\n\n[8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,0,0,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8]\n\nSo the input has 8 rows of 4 elements each. Following the pattern from the training examples, perhaps each row is split into pairs, and each pair is transformed into a 3x3 block. Since each input row has 4 elements, splitting into two pairs (since 4/2=2). Then each pair becomes a 3x3 block, and each input row contributes 3 rows to the output. With 8 input rows, the output would have 8*3=24 rows. But the training examples show that for 3 input rows, the output has 9 rows (3*3). Wait, that's 3 input rows, each contributing 3 output rows, leading to 9. But in Example 2, the input has four rows, and the output has 16 rows. So 4*4=16. So perhaps the number of output rows per input row depends on the input's number of elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are generated by expanding each input row into a number of rows equal to the number of elements in the input row. For example, a row with 6 elements becomes 6 rows. But Example 0's input has 6 elements per row, and the output has 9 rows, which doesn't match.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a pattern in the examples that can be generalized.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput rows: 3 rows of 6 elements each.\n\nOutput: 9 rows of 9 elements.\n\nEach output row is divided into three sections of three elements. Each section corresponds to an input element. For example, the first three elements of each output row correspond to the first input element of that input row. But the input has 6 elements, and the output has 9 columns. So each input element is mapped to 1.5 output columns, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, each input element is mapped to a 3x3 block, and the blocks are arranged in a grid that's 3 blocks wide and 3 blocks high. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the numbers in the output and see how they relate to the input.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 0: [2,0,4,0,8,0]. The output's first three rows have 2s and 4s. The 2 comes from the first input element, the 4 from the third input element (4), and the 4 in the fifth position (8 input) becomes 4. So maybe 8 is transformed into 4. So 8 /2 =4. Similarly, the input 4 is kept as 4. So the pattern seems to be that even numbers are halved, and odd numbers remain. But wait, in Example 1's input, there's a 1 and 2. In the output, the 1 remains 1, and the 2 is 2. So perhaps even numbers are divided by 2, and odd numbers are kept. So:\n\nFor each non-zero input element n:\n\nif n is even, output n/2 in a cross pattern in the 3x3 block.\n\nif n is odd, output n in the cross pattern.\n\nBut in Example 0, the 8 is even \u2192 8/2=4. The 4 is even \u21924/2=2. But in the output, the cross for 4 is 4. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, no. In Example 0's input, the third element is 4, which is even. According to the rule, 4/2=2. But in the output, the cross is 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value is placed as is, but the cross is formed by dividing by 2 each time. For example, the input 8 forms a cross of 4, and if there's another layer, then 2, etc. But this requires multiple layers, and the examples don't clearly show this.\n\nPerhaps the key is that each non-zero element in the input creates a cross in the output grid. The cross is centered at a position determined by the input's row and column indices, and the value of the cross is half of the input value. For example, input (i,j) with value v \u2192 output cross at (3i+1, 3j+1) with value v/2. Let's test this with Example 0.\n\nExample 0's input row 0 has elements [2,0,4,0,8,0]. The first non-zero element is 2 at (0,0). The output cross would be centered at (1,1) (since 3*0+1=1, 3*0+1=1). The cross would have value 2/2=1. But in the output, the cross is all 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value is not divided. The cross is centered at (3i+1, 3j+1) and has the same value as the input. But in Example 0's input element 8 at (0,4), the cross in the output has value 4. So 8 would be divided by 2. So perhaps each time you create a cross in the output, you divide the value by 2. For example, the input element is v. The output cross has value v/2. Then:\n\nExample 0's input 8 \u2192 cross value 4.\n\nInput 4 \u2192 cross value 2.\n\nBut in the output for Example 0, the cross for 4 in input is 4, not 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's think differently. Perhaps the output is a sum of contributions from each input element. For example, each input element contributes to multiple positions in the output, with their values spread out. For example, a input element at (i,j) contributes to a 3x3 area in the output centered at (i*3 +1, j*3 +1). Let's check this.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nFirst element 2 at (0,0) would contribute to output rows 0-2, columns 0-2. The center is (1,1). The cross would be rows 0-2, columns 0-2. Which matches the first three rows and columns in the output.\n\nThen the input element 4 at (0,2) would contribute to rows 0-2, columns 6-8 (since j=2 \u2192 3*2=6; columns 6-8). Which matches the third block in the output's first three rows.\n\nThe input element 8 at (0,4) would be j=4 \u2192 3*4=12 columns, but the output has only 9 columns. So this can't be. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps each input row is interleaved with other rows to form the output. For example, each input row is processed into three output rows, and the output rows are arranged such that the three rows from each input row are stacked. But how does this explain the numbers in the output?\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by placing each input element into a 3x3 block and arranging these blocks in a grid. For example, if the input is a 3x6 grid, the output is a 9x9 grid where each 3x3 block corresponds to an input element. But this doesn't fit the dimensions. For example, 3 rows *3 =9 rows, 6 columns *3=18 columns. But the output is 9x9. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, the input is a list of vectors, and the output is a matrix formed by the outer product of these vectors. But this seems unlikely given the examples.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the first three rows have non-zero values only in the first, third, and fifth 3x3 blocks. Which correspond to the input elements 2, 4, and 8. The input row has elements [2,0,4,0,8,0]. So every even index (0,2,4) has non-zero values. So perhaps each input element is placed into a 3x3 block at a position determined by its index. For example, in the input row, elements at even indices are placed in the output's 3x3 blocks, and odd indices are skipped. But then the output would have 3 blocks per row (since 6 even indices?), but the output has 9 columns. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the input elements are arranged in the output in a way that skips certain positions. For example, each input element is placed into a 3x3 block, but only every other block is used. This is getting too vague.\n\nLet's think about the Test Input and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nTest Input has 8 rows of 4 elements each. Following the pattern from the training examples, the output should have 8*3=24 rows (assuming each input row becomes 3 output rows) or 8*4=32 rows (if similar to Example 2). But the examples vary, so this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, since Example 0's input has 3 rows of 6 elements each and the output is 9 rows of 9, and Example 1's input has 3 rows of 6 elements leading to 9 rows of 9, while Example 2's input has 4 rows of 8 elements leading to 16 rows of 16 elements, perhaps the pattern is that the output dimensions are (number of input rows \u00d7 3) rows and (number of input columns \u00d7 1.5) columns. Wait, but in Example 0, 3 rows \u21929 rows (3\u00d73), and 6 columns \u21929 columns (6\u00d71.5). Example 2: 4 rows \u219216 rows (4\u00d74), and 8 columns \u219216 columns (8\u00d72). So for rows, the multiplier is squared (3 \u21923\u00b2=9; 4 \u21924\u00b2=16). For columns, 6 \u21929 (6\u00d71.5), 8 \u219216 (8\u00d72). So this is inconsistent. Hmm.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The number of output rows is the square of the number of input rows. For example, 3 input rows \u21929 output rows (3\u00b2), 4 input rows \u219216 (4\u00b2), etc. Similarly, output columns are the square of input columns. But input columns are 6, and output columns are 9 (which is 6\u00d71.5). So this doesn't fit. However, Example 2's input has 8 columns, output 16 (8\u00d72). So maybe for input columns, the output columns are input columns squared divided by 2. For 6 columns: 6\u00b2=36 /4=9. For 8: 8\u00b2=64/4=16. Yes, 36/4=9, 64/4=16. So output columns are (input columns\u00b2)/4. Similarly, output rows are (input rows)\u00b2. For Example 0: input rows=3 \u21923\u00b2=9 output rows. Input columns=6 \u21926\u00b2/4=36/4=9. Example 2: input rows=4 \u21924\u00b2=16, input columns=8 \u21928\u00b2/4=64/4=16. So this fits. Example 1: input rows=3, columns=6 \u2192 output rows=9, columns=9. Which fits 6\u00b2/4=9.\n\nSo the pattern for output dimensions is:\n\nOutput rows = (input rows)\u00b2\n\nOutput columns = (input columns)\u00b2 /4\n\nBecause:\n\nFor Example 0: 3 rows \u21929 rows (3\u00b2), 6 columns \u21929 columns (6\u00b2/4=36/4=9).\n\nExample 1: 3 rows \u21929 rows, 6 columns \u21929 columns.\n\nExample 2:4 rows \u219216 rows, 8 columns \u219216 columns.\n\nTest Input has 8 rows and 4 columns. So output rows should be 8\u00b2=64 rows. Output columns:4\u00b2/4=16/4=4. But this seems unlikely given the test input. However, looking at the Test Input's input:\n\nTest Input has 8 rows, each with 4 elements. According to the pattern, output rows should be 8\u00b2=64, and columns 4\u00b2/4=4. But the training examples' outputs have more columns. So this must not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern might involve each input element being expanded into a 3x3 block for Example 0 and 1, and into a 4x4 block for Example 2. But this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the number of output rows is the input rows multiplied by the input columns divided by 2. For Example 0:3 rows *6 columns/2=9. Which matches. Example 1:3*6/2=9. Example 2:4*8/2=16. This fits. Test Input has 8 rows *4 columns/2=16 rows. So output should have 16 rows. The columns would be input columns multiplied by 3/2. Example 0:6 *3/2=9. Example 2:8*3/2=12. But Example 2's output has 16 columns. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is not working. Let's try to think of the output as a combination of each input element's 3x3 cross, arranged in a grid where each input row becomes a vertical stack of 3x3 blocks, and each input column becomes a horizontal sequence of 3x3 blocks.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's input row 0: [2,0,4,0,8,0], each element is a 3x3 block. So the row would be:\n\n[block(2), block(0), block(4), block(0), block(8), block(0)]\n\nBut arranging these blocks horizontally would require 6*3=18 columns, but the output has 9 columns. So this is not possible. Therefore, this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother Idea: The output might be a convolution of the input with a certain kernel. For example, each input element is convolved with a cross-shaped kernel to produce the output. For instance, the kernel could be:\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 1\n\n0 1 0\n\nBut multiplied by the input value. So each input element would generate a cross of its value in the output. However, in Example 0's input row 0, the 2 would create a cross of 2s, the 4 a cross of 4s, and the 8 a cross of 8s. But in the output, the 8 becomes a cross of 4s. So this suggests that the kernel's values are multiplied by the input's value divided by 2. So 8/2=4. So the kernel is:\n\n0 0.5 0\n\n0.5 0.5 0.5\n\n0 0.5 0\n\nThen, each input element's value is multiplied by the kernel's values to produce the output. But how does this lead to overlapping? For example, if the input is [2,0,4,0,8,0], the output would be a sum of the cross contributions from each element. But this would require that the output is larger than the input. Let's think.\n\nIf each input element is convolved with a 3x3 kernel, then the output size would be (input rows + 2) x (input columns + 2). For Example 0's input (3x6), output would be 5x8, which doesn't match the 9x9 output. So this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm struggling to find a pattern. Maybe I need to look for a different approach. Let's consider the output for each example as a series of layers or levels. For instance, each input row generates a certain number of layers in the output.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each cell is determined by the sum of contributions from nearby input elements. For example, each input element contributes to a 3x3 area in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by expanding each input element into a 3x3 block where the center is the input value, and the surrounding cells are derived from it. For example:\n\nFor input value v, the block is:\n\nv   v   v\n\nv   v   v\n\nv   v   v\n\nBut this would create a 3x3 block of the same value, which doesn't match the examples. But looking at Example 0's first block, which has a cross of 2s and zeros elsewhere. So maybe the block is a cross, not a full square.\n\nSo for each input element v, create a 3x3 cross with v in the center and zeros elsewhere. Then, for non-zero v, the cross is:\n\n0 v 0\n\nv v v\n\n0 v 0\n\nBut in Example 0's first block, the cross is 2s. But then the input's 8 would create a cross of 8s, but in the output, it's 4s. So this doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, the cross is scaled down by a factor of 2. So v in the input becomes v/2 in the cross. So 2 becomes 1, but in the example, it's 2. So this is not correct.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's output, the first three rows have 2s and 4s. The second three rows (rows 3-5) have 3s. The third three rows (rows 6-8) have zeros. So the output's rows are grouped by the input rows. Each input row generates three output rows. For example:\n\nInput row 0 \u2192 output rows 0-2.\n\nInput row 1 \u2192 output rows 3-5.\n\nInput row 2 \u2192 output rows 6-8.\n\nSo each input row generates three output rows. Now, for each input row, how are the output rows generated? Let's look at Example 0's input row 0: [2,0,4,0,8,0].\n\nThe three output rows for this input row are:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nRow 1: [2,2,2,0,0,0,4,4,4]\n\nRow 2: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nLooking at these rows, it seems like each non-zero element in the input row is represented as a vertical line in the output rows. For example, the first element 2 creates a vertical line in column 1 across the three rows. The third element 4 creates a vertical line in column 7 across the three rows. The fifth element 8 creates a vertical line in column 7, but with value 4.\n\nBut how does this vertical line work? For example, the first element 2 is in position (0,0) of the input. In the output, it's a vertical line in column 1 (rows 0-2). The value is 2. The third element 4 is in position (0,2), which would correspond to column 3*2+1=7. So columns 7 in the output rows 0-2 have 4. But the fifth element is 8 at (0,4), which would be column 3*4+1=13, but the output has only 9 columns. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, each input element's column index is multiplied by 1.5, but that's not an integer. So this is not feasible.\n\nAnother Idea: The output's columns are arranged such that each input element's column is split into three columns in the output. For example, input column j becomes three output columns 3j, 3j+1, 3j+2. Then, for each input element v at (i,j), it's placed in the output's (3i+1, 3j+1) position, and the cross is formed around it. So:\n\nFor input v at (i,j):\n\noutput[3i][3j+1] = v\n\noutput[3i+1][3j] = v\n\noutput[3i+1][3j+1] = v\n\noutput[3i+1][3j+2] = v\n\noutput[3i+2][3j+1] = v\n\nThis forms a cross in the output. Let's test this with Example 0.\n\nExample 0's input element 2 at (0,0):\n\noutput[0][1] =2\n\noutput[1][0]=2, output[1][1]=2, output[1][2]=2\n\noutput[2][1]=2\n\nWhich matches the first three rows of the output:\n\nRow 0: 0,2,0,...\n\nRow 1: 2,2,2,...\n\nRow 2: 0,2,0,...\n\nYes. Then the next input element is 0 at (0,1), so no cross. The third element is 4 at (0,2):\n\noutput[0][7] =4 (since 3*2+1=7)\n\noutput[1][6]=4, output[1][7]=4, output[1][8]=4\n\noutput[2][7]=4\n\nBut the output's first three rows for columns 6-8 are:\n\nRow 0: 0,4,0\n\nRow 1:4,4,4\n\nRow 2:0,4,0\n\nYes. The fifth input element is 8 at (0,4):\n\noutput[0][13] =8 \u2192 but output has only 9 columns. So this is impossible. So this approach works for the first few elements but not all. So why does Example 0's output have 9 columns? Because the input has 6 columns, but according to this, 6*3=18 columns, but the output has 9. So perhaps the input columns are grouped into pairs, and each pair is mapped to 3 output columns. For example, each pair of input columns is mapped to a 3x3 block in the output columns. So for 6 input columns, 3 pairs \u2192 3*3=9 columns.\n\nSo each pair of input elements (j and j+1) becomes a 3x3 block in the output columns. For example:\n\nFor input columns j and j+1, the output columns are 3*(j//2) to 3*(j//2)+2.\n\nLet's see Example 0's input row 0:\n\nPairs are (0,1), (2,3), (4,5). Each pair is mapped to 3 output columns.\n\nFor the first pair (2,0):\n\nThe output columns 0-2 are determined by this pair. The first element is 2, the second is 0. How does this pair generate the 3x3 block for columns 0-2?\n\nThe output block for (2,0) is:\n\nRow 0: 0,2,0\n\nRow 1: 2,2,2\n\nRow 2:0,2,0\n\nWhich is a cross for 2, and the second element 0 is ignored. So perhaps the first element of the pair is used to create the cross, and the second element is ignored (or vice versa). But then, in Example 0's third pair (8,0), the output columns 6-8 have a cross for 4. So 8 is transformed into 4. So perhaps the first element of the pair is divided by 2 and used to create the cross. 8/2=4.\n\nSimilarly, the third element in the input row is 4, which is the first element of the second pair (4,0). 4/2=2. But in the output, the cross is 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the pair's sum or product is used. For example, 2 + 0 =2 \u2192 cross of 2. 4+0=4 \u2192 cross of 4. 8+0=8 \u2192 cross of 4. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, only the first element of each pair is used, and if it's even, divide by 2. So for pair (8,0): 8/2=4. Then cross of 4. This matches. Pair (4,0):4/2=2. But in the output, the cross is 4. So this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the first element of the pair is used as is, and if it's non-zero, create a cross with its value. If it's zero, use the second element. So for pair (2,0): use 2. Pair (4,0): use 4. Pair (8,0): use 8. But in the output, the cross for 8 is 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\nThe Test Input has 8 rows of 4 elements each. Following the pattern from Example 2 (which had 4 input rows \u219216 output rows), perhaps each input row generates 4 output rows. So 8 input rows \u219232 output rows. But the output in Example 2 has 16 rows for 4 input rows, which is 4 rows per input row. So 4 input rows \u00d74=16. So for Test Input, 8 rows \u00d74=32 output rows.\n\nEach input element may be converted into a 4x4 block. For Example 2's input elements, each becomes a 4x4 block. So for the Test Input's 4 elements per row, each row becomes 4\u00d74=16 columns. But 4 elements \u21924\u00d74=16 columns. So the output would be 32 rows \u00d716 columns. But Example 2's output has 16 rows and 16 columns for 4 input rows of 8 elements. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: The output for each input element is a cross, and the size of the cross depends on the element's value. For example, higher values have larger crosses. But this is not clearly supported by the examples.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the limited progress, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the following observations:\n\n- Each input row becomes three output rows in Example 0 and 1, and four in Example 2. \n\n- For each non-zero input element, it's represented as a cross in the output. The value in the cross is half of the input value if even, else the same.\n\n- The position of the cross in the output is determined by scaling the input indices.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n\nEach row has 4 elements. Let's assume each element is transformed into a 3x3 cross in the output. Each input row contributes 3 output rows, so 8 input rows \u219224 output rows. Each input element's cross is placed in a grid. For example, each input element (i,j) is placed in the output at (3i, 3j), forming a cross.\n\nBut given that the Test Input has 8 rows and 4 columns, the output would have 24 rows and 12 columns. But the examples vary, so this may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, based on Example 2, where each input row of 8 elements became 4 output rows, perhaps each input row is split into two pairs of 4 elements, and each pair generates 4 rows. For example, 8 input rows \u00d74 rows per input row =32 output rows, and 4 elements per row \u00d74 columns per element =16 columns. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to generate an output based on the following assumptions:\n\n- Each non-zero element in the input is represented as a cross in the output, with the value halved if even.\n\n- The position in the output is determined by scaling the input indices by a factor of 3.\n\nFor example, input element at (i,j) becomes a cross in the output at (3i+1, 3j+1), with the value v/2 if even, else v.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [3,0,0,1]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,2,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,2,2,0]\n\nRow 3: [3,0,0,3]\n\nRow 4: [0,8,8,0]\n\nRow 5: [8,8,8,8]\n\nRow 6: [8,0,0,8]\n\nRow 7: [8,8,8,8]\n\nProcessing each non-zero element:\n\nRow 0, col 0: 3 (odd) \u2192 cross at (1,1) with 3.\n\nRow 0, col 3: 1 (odd) \u2192 cross at (1,10) (3*3+1=10) with 1.\n\nRow 1, col 1: 2 (even) \u2192 cross at (4,4) with 1.\n\nRow 1, col 2: 2 \u2192 cross at (4,7) with 1.\n\nRow 2, col 1: 2 \u2192 cross at (7,4) with 1.\n\nRow 2, col 2: 2 \u2192 cross at (7,7) with 1.\n\nRow 3, col 0:3 \u2192 cross at (10,1) with 3.\n\nRow 3, col 3:3 \u2192 cross at (10,10) with 3.\n\nRow 4, col 1:8 \u2192 cross at (13,4) with 4.\n\nRow 4, col 2:8 \u2192 cross at (13,7) with 4.\n\nRow 5, col 0:8 \u2192 cross at (16,1) with 4.\n\nRow 5, col 1:8 \u2192 cross at (16,4) with 4.\n\nRow 5, col 2:8 \u2192 cross at (16,7) with 4.\n\nRow 5, col 3:8 \u2192 cross at (16,10) with 4.\n\nRow 6, col 0:8 \u2192 cross at (19,1) with 4.\n\nRow 6, col 3:8 \u2192 cross at (19,10) with 4.\n\nRow 7, col 0:8 \u2192 cross at (22,1) with 4.\n\nRow 7, col 1:8 \u2192 cross at (22,4) with 4.\n\nRow 7, col 2:8 \u2192 cross at (22,7) with 4.\n\nRow 7, col 3:8 \u2192 cross at (22,10) with 4.\n\nEach cross is a 3x3 block. However, this would result in a very large output, which doesn't match the training examples. Given that the Test Input's output should follow the pattern of the training examples, I'll need to adjust.\n\nAnother approach based on Example 1's output:\n\nIn Example 1, the input has elements like 8,4,1,2. The output's crosses have values 4, 2,1, and 2. So even numbers are halved, odd numbers are kept. So for the Test Input:\n\nEach even number v becomes v/2 in the cross.\n\nEach odd number v becomes v.\n\nSo:\n\n3 \u21923\n\n2 \u21921\n\n8 \u21924\n\n1 \u21921\n\n etc.\n\nThen, each non-zero element in the input creates a cross in the output. The output is constructed by placing these crosses in positions corresponding to the input indices scaled by 3.\n\nBut how to arrange the output rows and columns.\n\nGiven that the Test Input has 8 rows and 4 columns, and following Example 0's pattern (3 input rows \u21929 output rows, 6 input columns \u21929 columns), the output would have 8*3=24 rows and 4*3=12 columns. But Example 2's output for 4 input rows of 8 columns each is 16 rows and 16 columns, which is 4*4 rows and 8*2 columns. So perhaps the Test Input's output will have 24 rows (8*3) and 12 columns (4*3). But this is a guess.\n\nHowever, the Test Input has elements in multiple rows and columns that would create overlapping crosses. For example, input elements in adjacent columns may have crosses that overlap. This would require summing values in overlapping regions. But in the training examples, there are no overlapping values\u2014each cross seems to be placed in non-overlapping positions.\n\nThus, the output for the Test Input would be a grid where each input element is represented as a 3x3 cross placed at positions scaled by 3, with even values halved and odd values kept.\n\nPutting this together, the Test Input's output would be:\n\nEach input row becomes three output rows. For each non-zero element in the input, create a 3x3 cross in the output at the corresponding position.\n\nFor example:\n\nInput row 0: [3,0,0,1]\n\nThe non-zero elements are 3 at (0,0) and 1 at (0,3).\n\nEach of these would create a cross in the output:\n\nFor 3 at (0,0):\n\nOutput rows 0-2, columns 0-2:\n\nRow 0: 0,3,0\n\nRow 1:3,3,3\n\nRow 2:0,3,0\n\nFor 1 at (0,3):\n\nOutput rows 0-2, columns 9-11 (since 3*3=9):\n\nRow 0: 0,1,0\n\nRow 1:1,1,1\n\nRow 2:0,1,0\n\nThe rest of the columns would be zeros.\n\nBut this leads to a very wide output, which may not match the training examples. However, the training examples have outputs that are square matrices, so perhaps the Test Input's output will be 24 rows \u00d712 columns, but this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the complexity and time constraints, I'll proceed to generate an output based on the assumption that each non-zero input element is represented as a 3x3 cross in the output, with the value halved if even, and positioned in a grid scaled by 3, leading to overlapping rows and columns. However, I'll need to ensure that the output has the correct structure based on the training examples.\n\nAfter struggling to find a clear pattern, I'll make a best-effort attempt based on the following steps:\n\n1. Each non-zero element in the input is represented as a 3x3 cross in the output.\n2. The value in the cross is half of the input value if even, else the same.\n3. The crosses are placed in the output grid such that each input row is expanded into three output rows, and each input column into three output columns.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\nTest Input has 8 rows and 4 columns. So the output will have 8*3=24 rows and 4*3=12 columns.\n\nLet's process each input element:\n\nRow 0: [3,0,0,1]\n\n- 3 (odd) at (0,0): cross of 3s at (0-2, 0-2).\n- 1 (odd) at (0,3): cross of 1s at (0-2,9-11).\n\nRow 1: [0,2,2,0]\n\n- 2 (even) at (1,1): cross of 1s at (3-5,3-5).\n- 2 at (1,2): cross of 1s at (3-5,6-8).\n\nRow 2: [0,2,2,0]\n\n- 2 at (2,1): cross of 1s at (6-8,3-5).\n- 2 at (2,2): cross of 1s at (6-8,6-8).\n\nRow 3: [3,0,0,3]\n\n- 3 at (3,0): cross of 3s at (9-11,0-2).\n- 3 at (3,3): cross of 3s at (9-11,9-11).\n\nRow 4: [0,8,8,0]\n\n-8 at (4,1): cross of 4s at (12-14,3-5).\n-8 at (4,2): cross of 4s at (12-14,6-8).\n\nRow 5: [8,8,8,8]\n\n-8 at (5,0): cross of 4s at (15-17,0-2).\n-8 at (5,1): cross of 4s at (15-17,3-5).\n-8 at (5,2): cross of 4s at (15-17,6-8).\n-8 at (5,3): cross of 4s at (15-17,9-11).\n\nRow 6: [8,0,0,8]\n\n-8 at (6,0): cross of 4s at (18-20,0-2).\n-8 at (6,3): cross of 4s at (18-20,9-11).\n\nRow 7: [8,8,8,8]\n\n-8 at (7,0): cross of 4s at (21-23,0-2).\n-8 at (7,1): cross of 4s at (21-23,3-5).\n-8 at (7,2): cross of 4s at (21-23,6-8).\n-8 at (7,3): cross of 4s at (21-23,9-11).\n\nThen, the output would be a 24x12 grid with these crosses. However, this is a large grid, and the training examples have varying sizes. Given the time constraints and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed to format the output accordingly, but I'll note that this might not precisely match the expected pattern.",
