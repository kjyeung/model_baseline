        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples, then apply that to the test input. Let's start by looking closely at the examples.\n\nFirst, Example 0. The input has a lot of zeros except for some 8s forming a small cross and a 2 forming a larger rectangle with a hollow center. The output is a smaller grid with 2s on the borders and 8s inside in a cross pattern. Hmm. So maybe the process is taking certain structures from the input and condensing them into a smaller grid. The cross of 8s in the input becomes a similar cross in the output but smaller. The 2s in the input form a border in the output. Maybe it's detecting the largest structure of each number and then creating a composite of those structures in the output.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has a 2 structure that's a square with a hollow center and some 1s forming a sort of diamond shape below. The output combines these into a smaller grid with 2s as the border and 1s inside in a diamond pattern. So again, perhaps the output is combining the main features of each number from the input into a compacted form.\n\nExample 2 has a large 2 rectangle and then some 4s arranged in a pattern. The output includes the 2 border and the 4s in a structured way. The 4s in the input form a kind of arrow or triangle, and in the output, they are arranged in a grid with some 0s and 4s inside. This suggests that each distinct number's structure is being isolated, scaled down, and placed into the output grid in their respective regions.\n\nSo the pattern seems to involve:\n\n1. Identifying all distinct numbers (excluding 0) present in the input grid.\n2. For each number, find its largest contiguous area or structure.\n3. Resize each of these structures to fit into a smaller grid, possibly maintaining their relative positions or combining them into a composite where each number's structure is placed in a specific part of the output.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the output has 2 as the border and 8s inside. The input's 2 structure is a horizontal line with vertical lines, forming a rectangle. The output's 2s form a border, maybe the perimeter of the original structure. The 8s in the input form a cross, which in the output becomes a cross in the center.\n\nSimilarly, Example 1's 2 structure is a square, which becomes the border, and the 1s are a diamond inside. So perhaps each number's structure is scaled down and placed in the output in a way that their relative positions are maintained but combined into a single grid. But how?\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is a composite of the non-zero regions, scaled down, with overlapping regions combined. For instance, in Example 0, the 8s form a cross, which is centered. The 2s form a horizontal bar and vertical lines. In the output, the 2s form the border, and the 8s are in the center. So maybe the output is taking the outline of the largest structure (like the 2s forming a frame) and overlaying the smaller structure (8s cross) in the center.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a kind of \"bounding box\" around the non-zero elements, with each number's features compressed into layers. For example, the 2s outline the perimeter, and the 8s fill the center area.\n\nLooking at the test input. The input has a large rectangle made of 2s with a hollow center (since the inner cells are 0). Then, near the bottom, there's a 3 in a pattern that looks like a small cross (positions like [4,21]=3, [5,20]=3 and [5,22]=3, [6,21]=3). So maybe the 3s form a cross shape. The output should combine the 2 structure and the 3 structure.\n\nThe output would likely have a border of 2s (from the large rectangle) and in the center, the 3 cross. The size of the output grid might be determined by the size of the largest structure. In the test input, the 2 rectangle is 15 columns wide (from index 2 to 16), and the 3s are a small cross. The output grid's size would be based on the largest structure. The 2's structure is 15 columns, so maybe the output's width is 15-2* something. Wait, in the training examples, the input structures are larger than the output. For example, in Example 0, the input 2 structure spans 8 columns (from position 6 to 13?), and the output is 8 columns. So maybe the output's width is the width of the largest structure. For the test input, the 2's structure is from column 2 to 15 (14 columns), but in the output, perhaps it's reduced. Wait, in Example 2, the input 2 structure is 11 columns (from 2 to 12) and the output's first row is 11 elements. So maybe the output's row length is the width of the 2 structure. In the test input, the 2 structure spans columns 2 to 15 (14 columns), but the output's rows might be 14-2* something? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output dimensions are determined by the height and width of the largest structure. The 2 structure in the test input is 15 columns wide (from 2 to 16, inclusive?), and 13 rows tall (from row 4 to 17). Wait, rows 4 to 17 is 14 rows. Hmm. But the output in the examples seems to have rows equal to the height of the structure. For example, in Example 0, the 2 structure spans rows 7 to 14 (8 rows), and the output is 8 rows. So maybe the output's row count is the height of the 2 structure, and the columns are the width. For the test input, the 2 structure's height is from row 4 to row 17 (14 rows), so the output would have 14 rows. But that's not matching the training examples. Wait, in Example 0, the input 2 structure is in rows 7-14 (8 rows) and the output is 8 rows. In Example 1, the 2 structure is in rows 2-6 (5 rows) and the output has 5 rows. So yes, the output's row count is the height of the 2 structure, and the column count is the width of the 2 structure. Then, for other numbers like 8 in Example 0, their structures are scaled to fit within that output grid.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Identify the largest (or main) 2 structure in the input (the rectangle in the examples).\n2. The output grid dimensions are the height and width of this 2 structure.\n3. Then, within this grid, fill the borders with 2s (as the 2 structure's outline).\n4. For other numbers (like 8, 1, 4 in examples), their structures are scaled down and placed in the center or specific positions.\n\nBut how exactly are the other numbers placed? Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the 8s form a cross in the input. The output has an 8 cross in the center of the 2 border. So the 8s are centered within the output grid.\n\nIn Example 1, the 1s form a diamond in the input. The output has the 1s in the center rows, forming a diamond. So again, centered.\n\nIn Example 2, the 4s are arranged in the input in a certain pattern. The output has them in a section of the grid, perhaps scaled down. The 4s in the input are in rows 15-17 and columns 13-16. The output grid is 11 rows (from the 2 structure's height) and 11 columns. The 4s in the output are in rows 4-6 and columns 4-9, etc. Hmm, maybe their positions are scaled proportionally.\n\nSo for the test input, the 2 structure is from row 4 to row 17 (14 rows) and columns 2 to 15 (14 columns). So the output grid would be 14 rows by 14 columns. Wait, but the test input's 2 structure in row 4 has elements from column 2 to 15 (14 elements), and vertically from row 4 to 17 (14 rows). So the output would be a 14x14 grid. Then, the 2s would form the border. The 3s in the input are in rows 4,5,6 (row indices 4,5,6 in the input) and columns 20-22. But how does that translate into the output? Since the 3s are outside the 2 structure? Wait, the 2 structure is in rows 4-17 and columns 2-15, but the 3s are in row 4, column 21, row5:20 and 22, row6:21. So these are outside the 2 structure's area. So would the 3s be part of the output?\n\nWait, in the training examples, the output seems to include all non-zero numbers present in the input, regardless of their position. For example, in Example 2, the 4s are in the lower part of the input, but they are included in the output. So perhaps the process is to take all non-zero numbers, find their structures, and then combine them into the output grid based on the main 2 structure's dimensions and their relative positions.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the main 2 structure's outline as the border and overlaying other numbers' structures centered within. But in Example 2, the 4s are not centered. They're on the lower part of the input, but in the output, they are in the middle rows but spread across the columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number's structure is scaled down to fit within the output grid's dimensions (determined by the 2 structure), and placed in their relative positions. For example, if the 2 structure is 14 rows high and 14 columns wide, then other structures' positions are scaled proportionally. The 3s in the test input are located in rows 4-6 and columns 20-22. But the main 2 structure is in columns 2-15 (14 columns). The 3s are outside of this. Wait, this might be a problem. Because in the training examples, the other numbers (like 8,1,4) are within the area of the 2 structure. For example, in Example 0, the 8s are inside the 2 structure. Similarly, in Example 1, the 1s are below the 2 structure, but maybe the 2 structure is the main one, and other numbers are considered as separate entities. But in the test input, the 3s are outside the 2 structure. So would they be included?\n\nWait, looking back at Example 2: the 4s are in rows 15-17 and columns 13-16. The 2 structure is from rows 2-12 (11 rows) and columns 2-12 (11 columns). The 4s are outside of this area. But in the output, the 4s are included. So the output includes all non-zero numbers, regardless of their position relative to the main 2 structure. So the process must involve combining all non-zero structures into the output grid, scaled down to fit.\n\nSo the steps might be:\n\n1. For each non-zero number in the input, identify all regions (contiguous blocks) of that number.\n2. For each number, select the largest region (by area).\n3. Determine the output grid size based on the largest such region (maybe the maximum height and width among all selected regions). But in the examples, the main 2 structure's dimensions seem to dictate the output size. For example, in Example 0, the 2 structure is 8 rows tall and 8 columns wide (the output is 8x8). In Example 1, the 2 structure is 5 rows tall and 5 columns wide (output 5x5). Example 2: 2 structure is 11 rows and columns, output 11x11. So the output grid is determined by the main 2 structure's dimensions. But in Example 2, the 4 structure is in a different area but still included. So perhaps the 2's structure is used to determine the grid size, and other numbers' structures are scaled and placed into this grid based on their original positions relative to the 2 structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a composite where each number's largest region is scaled to fit into a grid whose size is determined by the largest dimension among all numbers. But that's not matching the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output grid's size is determined by the 2 structure's dimensions. Then, other numbers' structures are scaled down to fit within this grid. For example, in Example 0, the 8s are a small cross within the 2's larger rectangle. In the output, the 8s are centered. So maybe the 8s are scaled to fit inside the 2's grid.\n\nIn the test input, the 2 structure is a rectangle from columns 2-15 (14 columns) and rows 4-17 (14 rows). So the output would be 14x14. Then, the 3s are in a cross shape located at columns 20-22 and rows 4-6. Since the 3s are outside the 2 structure, how are they placed in the output? Or perhaps only numbers within the 2 structure's area are considered. But in Example 2, the 4s are outside the 2 structure but are included. So maybe all non-zero numbers are considered regardless of position.\n\nAlternatively, the output combines all non-zero numbers' largest regions into a grid that is the union of their bounding boxes. But in Example 0, the 2 and 8 structures are overlapping, so their union is the same as the 2's bounding box. In Example 1, the 2 and 1 structures are in different areas, but the output combines them into a smaller grid where the 2 is the border and the 1s are centered. So maybe the output grid is the bounding box of the combined structures, scaled down.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's look for another pattern. In all examples, the output's border is made of 2s. This suggests that the 2's structure forms the border. Then, other numbers fill the interior. The 8s in Example 0 are arranged in a cross inside. The 1s in Example 1 form a diamond inside. The 4s in Example 2 are arranged in a pattern in the lower part. So perhaps the 2's border is the outline of the output, and other numbers' structures are overlaid inside, scaled and positioned relative to their original positions in the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a kind of \"compressed\" view where each cell in the output corresponds to a block of cells in the input. For example, in Example 0, the input is 21 columns wide and 18 rows tall. The output is 8x8. So maybe each output row and column is an average or a summary of a section of the input. But that seems less likely since the numbers are preserved exactly.\n\nAnother approach: the output is the outline of the largest 2 region, filled with other numbers' largest regions inside. For example, in Example 0, the 2s form a rectangle, so the output is a rectangle border of 2s. The 8s are a cross inside, so they are placed in the center. In Example 1, the 2s form a square border, and the 1s are a diamond inside. So the pattern is:\n\n- The output is a border made of 2s, matching the outline of the largest 2 region in the input.\n- Inside the border, other numbers' largest regions are placed in a scaled-down manner, centered.\n\nBut how to handle multiple numbers, like in Example 2 which has 4s and 2s. The output includes the 2s as the border and the 4s in certain positions. The 4s in the output are in the middle rows but take up a larger area. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by taking the outline of the 2s and then overlaying all other non-zero regions as per their positions relative to the 2 structure. For example, if the 3s in the test input are to the right of the 2 structure, their positions in the output might be scaled to fit within the output grid's right side. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a crop of the input, focusing on the area covered by the 2 structure and other non-zero regions. But the examples don't seem to support that.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input and output. The input's 2 structure is a large rectangle from rows 2-11 and columns 2-12. The output is 11x11. The 4s in the input are below the 2 structure (rows 15-17). In the output, the 4s are in the middle and lower rows. So their position is adjusted. This suggests that the 4s are scaled down and placed in the output grid based on their original position relative to the entire input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of all non-zero structures, each scaled to fit into the output grid. For example, each structure is scaled to the size of the output grid, and overlapping regions are combined. But in Example 0, the 8s and 2s are separate structures. The output has 2s as borders and 8s inside. So perhaps each number's structure is scaled to fit into the output grid, maintaining their relative positions. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother angle: in all examples, the output's first and last rows are all 2s. The inner rows have 2s as the first and last elements, and other numbers in between. So perhaps the output is a frame of 2s, and the interior is filled with other structures. The 2 frame's size is determined by the largest 2 structure in the input. The interior of the frame is filled with other numbers' structures, scaled to fit.\n\nBut how are the other structures scaled? For example, in Example 0, the 8 cross is in the center. So the 8s are scaled down to fit the interior of the 2 frame. Similarly, in Example 1, the 1s are in the center. The test input's 3s form a cross outside the 2 frame, but perhaps they are scaled down and placed in the center of the output's interior.\n\nWait, the test input's 3s are in rows 4-6 and columns 20-22, which is outside the main 2 structure's columns (2-15). But perhaps the 3s are considered as a separate structure. However, the output's grid size is determined by the 2 structure's size. The 3s would then have to be scaled to fit within this grid. Since they are in a different area of the input, their scaled position in the output would be determined by their original position relative to the entire input. For example, if the input is 26 columns wide, and the 3s are at column 20-22, which is near the right edge, their position in the output (which is 14 columns wide) would be scaled proportionally. But this would require some coordinate mapping, which might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a union of all non-zero structures, scaled to a common grid size. But how that grid size is determined isn't clear.\n\nLet me try to find another approach. Let's look at the output dimensions:\n\nExample 0: Output is 8x8. The 2 structure in the input spans rows 7-14 (8 rows) and columns 6-13 (8 columns). So the output's size matches the size of the 2 structure.\n\nExample 1: Output is 5x5. The 2 structure in the input spans rows 2-6 (5 rows) and columns 2-6 (5 columns). So again, the output's size matches the 2 structure's size.\n\nExample 2: Output is 11x11. The 2 structure in the input is rows 2-12 (11 rows) and columns 2-12 (11 columns). So again, output size matches the 2 structure's size.\n\nSo the output grid's dimensions are determined by the 2 structure's height and width. The 2 structure's height is the number of rows it occupies, and the width is the number of columns. Then, the output grid has those dimensions.\n\nThen, the output is constructed as follows:\n\n- The border (first and last rows, first and last columns) are filled with 2s.\n- The interior is filled with other numbers' structures, scaled down to fit the interior of the output grid.\n\nBut how to scale them? For example, in Example 0, the 8s are in a cross that is 3 rows high and 3 columns wide in the input. The output's interior is 6x6 (excluding the borders), and the 8 cross is centered there.\n\nWait, Example 0's output has 8 rows. The first and last rows are all 2s. The remaining 6 rows have 2s at the first and last positions. So the interior is 6x6. The 8 cross is in rows 3-4 (0-based) and columns 3-4. So maybe the 8 cross in the input (which is 3 rows high and 3 columns wide) is scaled to 2 rows high and 2 columns wide in the output's interior. But this is not exactly clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output's interior (excluding the 2 borders) is filled by taking the other numbers' structures, centering them, and scaling to fit the interior. For example, the 8 cross in Example 0's input is 3x3, and the output's interior is 6x6. So the cross is centered and perhaps replicated or scaled.\n\nBut perhaps the other numbers are placed in the output grid based on their position relative to the 2 structure. For example, if a structure is centered within the 2 structure's area in the input, it's centered in the output's interior. If it's offset to the left, it's placed accordingly.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a \"stamp\" of the 2 structure's outline and the other structures' shapes. For each cell in the output, if the corresponding cell in the input's 2 structure is part of the outline (i.e., border), then it's 2. Otherwise, if there's another number's structure overlapping that cell, it's that number. But how to map the input's cells to the output's cells when the sizes are different.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the 2 structure's outline, and other numbers are placed inside based on their presence in the input's 2 structure's interior. For example, in Example 0, the 8s are inside the 2 structure's area. So in the output, the 8s are placed in the corresponding positions, scaled down. But in Example 2, the 4s are outside the 2 structure's area but still included. So this idea doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of all non-zero numbers, with the 2s forming the outline and other numbers filling the interior, regardless of their original positions, perhaps centered. For instance, any non-zero number's largest structure is centered within the output's interior.\n\nIn the test input, the 3s form a small cross. The output would have a 2 border and the 3 cross centered inside. So the output might look like a border of 2s, and the center has the 3s in a cross pattern.\n\nBut how about the exact dimensions? Let's see:\n\nThe test input's 2 structure spans from row 4 to row 17 (14 rows) and column 2 to 15 (14 columns). So the output grid is 14x14. The border would be 2s. The interior is 12x12 (excluding the first and last row and column). The 3s in the input are in a cross:\n\nRow 4, column 21 (3)\nRow 5, columns 20 and 22 (3s)\nRow 6, column 21 (3)\n\nBut these are outside the 2 structure's area. Wait, the 2 structure is columns 2-15. The 3s are in columns 20-22. So they are outside. But according to the training examples, even numbers outside the main 2 structure are included in the output. For example, in Example 2, the 4s are below the 2 structure. So perhaps the output is a composite of all non-zero numbers' largest regions, scaled to fit the output grid determined by the 2 structure's size. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output's grid is the 2 structure's size, and all other numbers are mapped into this grid based on their original positions relative to the 2 structure's bounding box. For example, if the 2 structure's bounding box starts at (row_start, col_start) and has height H and width W, then any cell (r, c) in the input is mapped to ( (r - row_start) * (output_height / H), (c - col_start) * (output_width / W) ) in the output. This would scale and translate the positions into the output grid.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 structure is from row 7 to 14 (8 rows) and columns 6 to 13 (8 columns). So any cell inside this area is mapped to the output grid. The 8s are within this area. So their positions are scaled accordingly. For example, the 8s are in row 3-5 and columns 5-7 in the input's 2 structure. When scaled to the 8x8 output, they would be in the center.\n\nIn the test input's case, the 2 structure is from row 4 to 17 (14 rows) and column 2 to 15 (14 columns). The output is 14x14. Any non-zero cells outside this area (like the 3s) are not mapped, unless the mapping considers the entire input. Wait, but in Example 2, the 4s are outside the 2 structure's bounding box but are included in the output. So perhaps the mapping is not relative to the 2 structure's position but the entire input.\n\nAlternatively, the output grid is of size HxW, where H and W are the height and width of the 2 structure. Then, each other number's structure is scaled to fit into this grid. For example, their positions are scaled proportionally based on their original positions in the entire input.\n\nBut this requires knowing the entire input's dimensions, which vary. For example, the input in Example 0 is 21 columns wide and 18 rows tall, while the 2 structure is 8x8. So the output is 8x8. The 8s in Example 0's input are in row 3 (of 18 rows), which would be scaled to row (3/18)*8 = 1.3 ~ row 1. But in the output, the 8s start at row 3 (0-based), which is row 3 in 8 rows. So this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, the output grid's cells correspond to the cells of the 2 structure in the input. For example, each cell in the output corresponds to a cell in the input's 2 structure. But in Example 0, the output is 8x8, which matches the 2 structure's size. So each cell in the output represents a cell in the input's 2 structure. Then, for other numbers, if their structures are within the 2 structure's area, they are copied; if not, they are ignored. But in Example 2, the 4s are outside the 2 structure but are included. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output grid is filled with 2s as a border. The interior is filled with other numbers based on their presence in the entire input. But how? This seems too vague.\n\nMaybe another approach: The output is the 2 structure's outline (border) filled with 2s, and the interior cells are determined by the presence of other numbers. If another number's structure overlaps with the 2 structure's interior, those cells are filled with that number. Otherwise, they are 0. But in Example 0, the 8s are inside the 2 structure's area. So in the output's interior, the 8s are placed where they were in the input. But how to scale them into the output's smaller grid.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a downsampled version of the input's 2 structure and other numbers. For example, each cell in the output represents a block of cells in the input. For instance, if the input's 2 structure is 14x14, each output cell represents a single input cell. But in Example 0, the input's 2 structure is 8x8, and the output is 8x8. So each cell is copied directly. But the 8s in Example 0's input are within the 2 structure's area and are present in the output's interior. So perhaps the output is the 2 structure's outline (border) as 2s, and the interior is taken from the input's interior, but scaled down. But scaling down would require aggregating, but the examples show exact numbers.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input's 2 structure is a hollow rectangle (border is 2s, interior is 0). The output's interior has 8s. So the output is combining the 2's border with the 8's structure. So the 8s are from another part of the input. So it's not simply taking the interior of the 2 structure. Hence, the output is a combination of the 2's outline and other numbers' structures.\n\nThis suggests that the process is:\n\n1. Identify the largest 2 structure in the input. The output grid dimensions are the height and width of this structure.\n2. Draw the outline of this structure with 2s (first and last rows and columns).\n3. For each other number present in the input, identify their largest structure and overlay it into the output grid's interior, centered and scaled to fit.\n\nIn Example 0, the 8's structure is a small cross, which is centered in the output grid's interior. In Example 1, the 1's structure is centered. In Example 2, the 4's structure is centered in the lower part of the output. Wait, in Example 2's output, the 4s are in rows 4-6 and columns 4-9. So not exactly centered. Hmm. Maybe their position in the input is mapped proportionally to the output grid.\n\nBut how to handle multiple numbers. For example, in the test input, there are 2s and 3s. The output should have a 2 border and the 3s' structure inside. The 3s in the input are a small cross. So in the output, they would be centered in the interior.\n\nPutting this together, the steps could be:\n\n- Find the largest 2 structure. Determine the output grid size (height x width).\n- Output's border is 2s.\n- For each other number, find their largest structure, scale it to fit inside the output's interior (excluding the border), and center it.\n\nBut how to scale. For example, if the 3s in the test input are a 3x3 cross, and the output's interior is 12x12 (since the output is 14x14, minus 2 for borders), then the 3s would be scaled up or down to fit.\n\nBut looking at the examples, the scaling seems to be 1:1. For example, Example 0's 8 cross is 3x3 in the input and 4x4 in the output's interior. Wait, the output's interior is 6x6 (since output is 8x8, borders are 2 cells). The 8 cross in the output is two rows of 8s in the middle. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the other numbers are centered and their shapes are preserved as much as possible. For example, the 8 cross in Example 0 is three rows in the input and becomes two rows in the output. Or perhaps the output's interior is filled by tiling or repeating the original pattern.\n\nThis is getting too ambiguous. Let's try to think of the test case. The 2 structure is a large hollow rectangle. The 3s are a cross outside of this. The output should have a 14x14 grid with 2s as the border. The 3s' cross would need to be centered inside this grid. So the output's interior (12x12) would have a 3 cross. For example:\n\nRows 6-8 (middle) and columns 6-8, but the exact positioning depends on scaling.\n\nBut how to map the 3s' position. The input's 3s are at rows 4-6 and columns 20-22. The output's grid is 14x14. The 3s are outside the 2 structure's columns (2-15). So perhaps the 3s are not included. But according to the training examples, numbers outside the 2 structure are included. For example, Example 2's 4s are outside the 2 structure's area but are included in the output. So maybe the 3s are included in the test output.\n\nAlternatively, the output combines all non-zero structures, scaled to fit into the 14x14 grid. The 2s' border is around the entire grid, and the 3s' cross is placed in their relative position. For example, the 3s are in the input's columns 20-22. The input's total width is 26 columns. So the 3s are at columns 20-22, which is near the right edge. The output grid is 14 columns wide, so the 3s would be scaled to the right side of the output.\n\nBut how to calculate this. The input's width is 26. The 3s are at columns 20-22. So their positions relative to the entire input can be mapped to the output's 14 columns. For example, 20-22 in input columns (26 wide) would be (20/26)*14 \u2248 10.77, so columns 10-12 in the output. Similarly, the rows: the input has 24 rows (test input has 24 rows). The 3s are at rows 4-6. So (4/24)*14 \u2248 2.33 \u2192 row 2-3, and (6/24)*14 = 3.5 \u2192 row 3-4. So in the output, the 3s would be in rows 2-4 and columns 10-12. But the output's border is 2s, so the actual interior starts from row 1 to row 12 (assuming 0-based), and columns 1 to 12. So the 3s would be placed in this area. But how to form the cross.\n\nAlternatively, the output's grid is determined by the 2 structure's dimensions, and all other numbers' structures are scaled and positioned based on their original coordinates relative to the 2 structure's bounding box. For example, in the test input, the 2 structure starts at column 2 and row 4. The 3s are at column 20, which is 18 columns away from the start of the 2 structure. The 2 structure's width is 14 columns. So the 3s are 18-2=16 columns from the start of the input's 2 structure. But this exceeds the 2 structure's width, so perhaps the 3s are placed outside the output's grid, which isn't possible. Hence, they are not included. But this contradicts Example 2's case.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's look for another pattern. In all examples, the output is a grid that's smaller than the input. The output's rows and columns correspond to the largest 2 structure's dimensions. The output's border is 2s. The interior has other numbers. The way these numbers are arranged seems to mirror their arrangement in the input. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in a diamond shape in the input and the same in the output. The output's diamond is smaller but same structure.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is to take the largest 2 structure, use its dimensions for the output, create a border of 2s, and then fill the interior with other numbers' structures, scaled down but maintaining their shape and relative position.\n\nBut how to scale. Let's think about Example 0. The input's 8 cross is 3x3. The output's interior is 6x6. The 8 cross is centered and appears to be 2 rows high and 2 columns wide. So maybe scaling factor is 2/3. But it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the other structures are centered in the output's interior. For example, in Example 0, the 8 cross is centered. In Example 1, the 1s' diamond is centered. So for the test input, the 3s' cross would be centered in the output's interior, forming a similar cross.\n\nIf that's the case, the test output would have a 14x14 grid. The first and last rows are all 2s. The first and last columns are 2s. The interior 12x12 grid would have the 3s forming a cross centered. The cross might be in the middle rows and columns.\n\nBut how large is the cross? In the input, the 3s form a cross of three cells vertically and three horizontally. Centered in a 12x12 grid, this would be around rows 5-7 and columns 5-7. But the exact pattern depends on how scaling works. Since the input's 3 cross is 3x3, the output's cross would be scaled down. For example, it could be a smaller cross, like 2x2.\n\nAlternatively, the cross is replicated as is. For example, the output's cross would be three rows high and three columns wide, centered.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say. However, looking at Example 1, the input's 1s are a diamond that is 3 rows high (rows 9-11) and 3 columns wide. The output's diamond is 3 rows high and 3 columns wide. So perhaps the scaling is 1:1 if the output's interior is large enough. Example 1's output is 5x5, so the interior is 3x3. The diamond fits exactly.\n\nIn the test case, the output's interior is 12x12 (14x14 grid with border). The 3s' cross is 3x3 in the input. So in the output's interior, it would be centered as a 3x3 cross. But how? For example:\n\nIn rows 5-7 and columns 5-7 of the interior:\n\nRow 5: column 6 has 3\nRow 6: columns 5,6,7 have 3\nRow 7: column 6 has 3\n\nThis would form a cross. Then, surrounded by 0s. But in the output's grid, how is this positioned within the 2 border.\n\nAlternatively, the cross is scaled up to fit the larger interior, but that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, the output's interior is filled with the other numbers' structures, preserving their original size and positioning relative to their own bounding boxes. For example, the 3s' cross is placed in the center of the output's interior, maintaining their 3x3 size.\n\nSo the test output would have a 14x14 grid with 2s on the border. Inside, there's a 3x3 cross of 3s centered.\n\nPutting this together, the output would look like:\n\nFirst row: all 2s.\nRows 1-12: 2 at start and end, 0s or 3s in between.\nLast row: all 2s.\n\nThe 3 cross would be in the middle. For example:\n\nRow 6: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRow 7: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRow 8: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the cross is larger. The test input's 3 cross is three cells tall and three wide, but in the output's 12x12 interior, it could be a similar size.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output's other numbers are placed in the same relative position as they are in the input. For example, if the 3s are in the upper part of the input, they would be in the upper part of the output's interior. But this requires scaling their positions.\n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed with the assumption that the output is a border of 2s, and the interior contains the other numbers' largest structures centered. For the test input, this would mean a 14x14 grid with 2s as the border and a centered 3 cross. The exact pattern would resemble Example 0's 8 cross but with 3s.\n\nThe cross in the output would likely be:\n\nRow 6: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRow 7: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRow 8: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\nBut considering the output's dimensions are larger, maybe the cross is larger. However, since the input's 3 cross is small, the output's cross might be similar in size. Alternatively, the 3s are arranged in a cross that's scaled to fit the output's interior. Since the interior is 12x12, the cross could be larger. But without clear examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAnother observation: in the training examples, the output's non-2 numbers are always centered. So in the test case, the 3s would be centered. Given that, the cross would be in the middle of the 14x14 grid. For a 14x14 grid, the center is around row 7 and column 7. So the cross might be:\n\nRows 6-8, columns 6-8:\n\nRow 6: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRow 7: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRow 8: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\nBut the exact positions might vary. This would create a cross in the center.\n\nFinally, the output should look like:\n\nFirst and last rows are all 2s.\nRows in between start and end with 2, with the 3 cross in the middle.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nBut I'm not sure if the 3 cross would be three rows tall or more. The test input's 3s are three rows. So perhaps the output's cross is three rows as well, centered. Alternatively, since the output's interior is larger, the cross might be larger. But without more examples, it's hard to tell. But given the training examples, I'll assume the cross is three rows tall and three columns wide, centered in the output's interior.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. The input is a grid of numbers, and the output is another grid. The examples show that the output seems to be some kind of transformation of the input. Let's look at each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0: The input has a structure with 8s forming a diamond shape in the middle and a rectangle made of 2s below it. The output is a smaller grid with 2s forming the border, 8s inside, and some zeros. It looks like the output is combining elements from different parts of the input. The border is from the 2s in the input's lower section, and the 8s might be from the diamond above.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2s forming a square and some 1s in a cross shape. The output is a smaller square with 2s on the border and the 1s arranged in a cross inside. So maybe the output is taking the main structures from the input and combining them into a compact form, preserving their relative positions but scaling them down.\n\nExample 2's input has a large square of 2s and some 4s arranged in a pattern. The output is a grid where the 2s form the border again, and the 4s are placed inside in a specific arrangement. Notice that the 4s in the input are in a diagonal or cross-like shape, and the output arranges them into blocks.\n\nPutting this together, it seems like the pattern involves:\n\n1. Identifying the main structures (like borders and inner patterns) from the input.\n2. Combining these structures into a smaller grid, possibly overlaying them.\n3. The output's size is determined by the size of the main structures. For example, in Example 0, the 2s in the input form a horizontal line, which becomes the border of the output.\n\nLooking at the test input: There's a large square made of 2s, and some 3s arranged in a sort of cross (like the 1s in Example 1 but with 3s). Following the pattern from previous examples, the output should have a border of 2s (from the square in the input) and the 3s arranged in their cross shape inside. The size of the output grid would be determined by the size of the 2s square and the 3s cross.\n\nIn the test input, the 2s form a 14x14 square (from index 2 to 15 in rows and columns?), and the 3s are in a cross pattern around row 4-5 and columns 20-22. The output should probably be a grid that combines these elements. The border would be 2s, and the 3s would form a cross in the center. The exact dimensions need to be determined based on how the input's structures are scaled down. The test input's output might be a 5x5 grid with 2s on the borders and 3s in a cross inside, similar to Example 1's structure but with 3s instead of 1s.",
