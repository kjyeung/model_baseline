        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input and output arrays where each is a 10x10 grid of numbers (0, 2, 5). The task is to see how the input is transformed into the output. Let's look at the training examples first.\n\nStarting with Example 0. Let's compare the input and output row by row. For instance, the first row in input is [0,5,5,5,0,0,2,5,5,5] and the output is the same. So maybe no change here. But looking at the next row: input is [0,5,0,0,0,2,5,2,0,5], output becomes [0,5,0,0,0,2,5,2,2,5]. Oh, the 0 before the last 5 turned into a 2. Hmm. Let's check another row. Third input row [0,5,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,0] becomes [0,5,5,0,0,0,2,2,5,2]. So here, the 7th element (index 6 maybe?) was 0, becomes 2, and the last 0 becomes 2. Wait, maybe there's a rule when a 0 is adjacent to a 2?\n\nWait, looking at the input in Example 0's second row: the element that changes is the 8th position (0 to 2). Let's see the neighbors. Original was 0, surrounded by 2 (previous element) and 5 (next). Maybe if a 0 is between a 2 and a 5, it turns into a 2? Or maybe it's related to the presence of 2s in adjacent cells. Let's check another example.\n\nIn Example 0's third row, the original row is [0,5,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,0]. The output changes the 0 at position 6 (value 0) to 2, and the last 0 to 2. The original 0s are next to a 2 (the 2 is at position 6, but wait, in the input, the 2 is at position 6, then the next element is 0 (position 7) which becomes 2. So maybe if a 0 is next to a 2, it becomes a 2. Let's check that.\n\nAnother example: In Example 1, the sixth row input is [5,2,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0], and output becomes [5,2,2,2,2,5,2,2,2,2]. All the 0s after the 5 are turned into 2s. That makes sense if 0s adjacent to 2s get converted. Wait, but the 0s here are adjacent to a 5 first. Wait, in that row, the 5 is followed by 0s. But in the output, those 0s turn into 2s. Hmm, maybe the rule is that any 0 that is adjacent (either left or right) to a 2 becomes a 2. Let me see.\n\nWait, in Example 1's sixth input row, the original is [5,2,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0]. The 5 is at position 5, followed by 0s. The output changes those 0s to 2s. But why? Because the 0s are next to a 5 and a 2? Wait, the 0s are after the 5. The 5 is at position 5 (value 5), then 0,0,0,0. But the previous element is a 5, not a 2. So perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe there's a different rule. Let's see another example.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input row [5,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5] becomes [5,2,5,2,5,5,0,5,5,5]. So the 0s at positions 1 and 3 turn into 2s. What's around them? The first 0 is between 5 (left) and 5 (right). The second 0 is between 5 (left) and 5 (right). So maybe if a 0 is between 5s, it becomes 2? But wait, in Example 0's first row, there are 5s and 0s but some 0s stay 0. For instance, the first row's 0s remain 0. So that can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the presence of 2s in adjacent cells. For instance, in Example 0's second row, the 0 that becomes 2 is adjacent to a 2 on the left (position 5 is 2, then position 6 is 5, then position 7 is 2). Wait, original input row is [0,5,0,0,0,2,5,2,0,5]. The output changes the 8th element (0) to 2. That 0 is between 2 (position 7) and 5 (position 9). So adjacent to a 2 on the left. So maybe any 0 that has a 2 to the left becomes 2. But in Example 1's sixth row, the 0s after the 5 (position 5) become 2s. The element before them is 5, then 0s. But in the output, those 0s become 2. Wait, that would contradict the previous idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 0s are replaced by 2s if there's a 2 somewhere in their row or column. But that seems less likely. Let's check Example 2's third row input: [5,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,5,5]. The output changes the 0s at positions 1 and 3 to 2, but the 0s at positions 6 and 7 stay 0. So the 0s that are next to 5s? But earlier examples have 0s next to 5s that stay 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that 0s are converted to 2s if they are surrounded by certain numbers. Let's think of the grid as a 2D array. Maybe a 0 becomes 2 if any of its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) is a 2. Let's test that.\n\nLooking at Example 0's second row in the input. The 0 at position 8 (original 0 in input) is changed to 2. Let's check its neighbors. The cell to the left is 0 (position 7 in the same row is 2), and the cell to the right is 5. Also, check the cell above and below. Wait, maybe it's considering all four directions. Let's take that row in the input:\n\nInput row (Example 0, second row) is [0,5,0,0,0,2,5,2,0,5]. The output changes the 0 at position 8 (index 8) to 2. Let's check the cells around it in the grid. The cell to the left is 2 (position 7), the cell to the right is 5. The cell above would be the same position in the row above. The row above in the input is [0,5,5,5,0,0,2,5,5,5]. Position 8 in the row above is 5. The cell below would be the same position in the row below. The row below is [0,5,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,0], position 8 is 5. So the neighboring cells for input row 2, position 8: left is 2, right is 5, above is 5, below is 5. So if any neighbor is 2, the 0 becomes 2. Since the left neighbor is 2, this 0 becomes 2.\n\nAnother example: in Example 1, the sixth input row is [5,2,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0], and the output changes the 0s to 2s. Let's check the neighbors. The first 0 (position 6) is adjacent to 5 (left) and 0 (right). But maybe the cell above or below has a 2. Let's see the rows above and below for this row (row 5 in Example 1 input):\n\nRow 5 input: [5,2,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0]\nRow 4 input: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5]\nRow 6 input: [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5]\n\nSo for position 6 in row 5: the cell above (row4, position6) is 5, cell below (row6, position6) is 5. So the neighbors in the same column are 5 and 5. But in the same row, the left neighbor is 5 (position5) and the right neighbor is 0. So why are the 0s turning into 2s here? Because in the same row, the left neighbor is 5, but maybe there's a 2 in the row above or below. Wait, row5 has 2s in the first four positions. But position6 is after 5. Hmm. Maybe there's a different pattern here. Alternatively, maybe the 0s are being converted to 2s if there's a 2 anywhere in their row, but that doesn't make sense because in Example0, some rows have 2s and some 0s get converted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s are converted to 2s when they are adjacent (either horizontally or vertically) to a 2. Let's check that. For example, in Example1's sixth row (output row5), all the 0s after 5 become 2. The 5 is at position5. The next 0s are positions6-9. Let's check their neighbors. Position6: left is 5 (from same row), right is 0 (position7). Above is row4's position6: which is 5 (from row4 input [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5], position6 is 5). Below is row6's position6: 5. So the neighbors for position6 in row5 are 5 (left), 0 (right), 5 (above), 5 (below). So no 2s adjacent. But in the output, this 0 becomes 2. That contradicts the previous idea. So maybe that's not the rule.\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Let's think differently. Maybe the 0s are being replaced by 2s based on certain conditions. Let's compare the input and output in each example and see which 0s become 2s.\n\nLooking at Example0's input and output. The first row of input is [0,5,5,5,0,0,2,5,5,5], output is same. So no changes. The 0s here are in positions0,4,5. They remain 0. Then the next row: input has 0s at positions0,2,3,4,8. Output changes position8 from 0 to 2. Let's check what's around position8. In the input, position8 is 0. The row is [0,5,0,0,0,2,5,2,0,5]. So the left neighbor is 2 (position7), right neighbor is5 (position9). In the same column (column8), what's above and below? The row above (row0) in column8 is 5. The row below (row2) in column8 is 5. So, maybe the left neighbor is 2, so the 0 becomes 2. So the rule could be: if a 0 has a 2 in any adjacent cell (left, right, up, down), then it becomes 2.\n\nLet's test this rule with another example. In Example2's input row [5,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5], the output is [5,2,5,2,5,5,0,5,5,5]. The 0s at positions1 and 3 become 2. Let's check their neighbors. Position1: left is5 (position0), right is5 (position2). Up: row above (if any) in the input. Let's check the input for Example2. The rows in input are:\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5]\nRow1: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5]\nRow2: [5,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5] \u2192 this is the row we're looking at.\nSo for position1 in row2 (0), the cell above (row1, position1) is5. The cell below (row3, position1) is0. So neighbors for position1 in row2: left5, right5, above5, below0. None of these are 2. So according to the previous rule, this 0 shouldn't become 2. But in the output, it does. So that contradicts the rule.\n\nHmm. So maybe there's another pattern. Let's look for other possibilities.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps 0s are replaced by 2s if they are part of a region of 0s that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a 2. But in Example0's second row, the 0 at position8 is isolated (only 0 in that area), but it's next to a 2 on the left, so it becomes 2. So maybe any 0 adjacent to a 2 becomes 2. But in Example2's row2, the 0s at positions1 and 3 become 2, but their neighbors (left and right) are 5 and 5. So why would that happen? Unless there's a 2 somewhere else nearby.\n\nWait, looking at the entire input grid for Example2. Let's take the input row2: [5,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5]. The output changes the 0s at positions1 and3 to 2. Let's check all adjacent cells for these 0s. For position1 (0) in row2: left is5 (row2, position0), right is5 (row2, position2), up is row1, position1:5, down is row3, position1:0. So no 2s adjacent. But the 0 is turned into 2. So that can't be because of adjacent 2s. So maybe the rule isn't about adjacent cells.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the positions where 0s are converted to 2s. Are they in specific columns or rows? For example, in Example0's output, the first row is unchanged. The second row has a 2 introduced at position8. The third row has 2s introduced at positions7 and9. The fourth row has a 2 introduced at position8. The fifth row is unchanged. The sixth row introduces 2s at positions1,6,8. The seventh row introduces several 2s. The eighth row introduces 2s. The ninth row introduces a 2 at position6.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 2s in the same column. Let's check Example0's input. For the second row, position8. The column8 in the input is:\n\nRow0:5\nRow1:0\nRow2:5\nRow3:0\nRow4:5\nRow5:5\nRow6:0\nRow7:0\nRow8:5\nRow9:5\n\nSo column8 in the input has no 2s. Then why does the 0 in row1, column8 become 2 in output? Because the input has a 2 in row1, position5. Wait, maybe the 0s are converted to 2 if there is a 2 in the same row. But in row1 of Example0's input, there's a 2 at position5 and position7. So maybe any 0 in a row that contains a 2 is converted to 2. But in the first row of Example0's input, there's a 2 at position6, but the 0s in that row (positions0,4,5) remain 0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 0s are converted to 2s in a wave-like manner, starting from existing 2s. For example, any 0 adjacent (including diagonally?) to a 2 becomes 2. Let's test that.\n\nIn Example0's second row input: [0,5,0,0,0,2,5,2,0,5]. The 2s are at positions5 and7. The 0 at position8 (adjacent to position7's 2) becomes 2. That fits. The 0 at position8 is next to a 2 on the left. So maybe the rule is that any 0 adjacent to a 2 (left, right, up, down) becomes 2 in the next step. But how is this applied in the examples? Let's see.\n\nIn Example1's sixth input row: [5,2,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0]. The 0s are after the 5. The left neighbor of the first 0 (position6) is 5 (position5). The right neighbors are 0s. But in the output, these 0s become 2s. How does that fit? Unless there's a 2 below or above. Let's check the rows above and below in the input.\n\nRow5 input (Example1) is [5,2,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0], row6 is [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5]. So for position6 in row5, the cell below (row6, position6) is5. The cell above (row4, position6) is5. So no 2s adjacent. So why do these 0s become 2s? Unless the rule is that 0s in a row that contains a 2 anywhere are converted. But row5 has 2s, so all 0s in that row become 2s. Let's check. The output for row5 is [5,2,2,2,2,5,2,2,2,2], which converts all 0s to 2s. But in Example0's first row, there is a 2, but the 0s remain. So that can't be the case.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 0s are converted to 2s if they are to the right of a 2 in the same row. In Example0's second row input, the 0s after the 2s (positions5 and7) become 2s. For example, the 0 at position8 is after the 2 at position7. Similarly, in Example1's sixth row, the 0s are after the 2s, which are in positions1-4 and 5. Wait, the 0s start at position6, after the 5. But in the output, they become 2s. So that theory might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 0s are replaced by 2s if there's a 2 in the same column. Let's take Example0's second row, position8. The column8 has 5 (row0),0 (row1),5 (row2),0 (row3),5 (row4),5 (row5),0 (row6),0 (row7),5 (row8),5 (row9). No 2s in column8. So that doesn't explain it.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is applied in multiple passes. Like, first, existing 2s cause adjacent 0s to become 2s, and this process repeats. But looking at the examples, maybe the output is after one iteration of converting 0s adjacent to 2s into 2s.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. For example, in Example0's input, the second row has 2s at positions5 and7. The 0s adjacent to these 2s (left, right, up, down) would be the 0 at position6 (next to position5's 2), but in the input, position6 is5. Wait, the input row is [0,5,0,0,0,2,5,2,0,5]. The 2s are at positions5 and7. The 0s adjacent to these 2s would be position4 (left of 2 at5), position6 (right of 2 at5), position6 (left of 2 at7), and position8 (right of 2 at7). So the 0s at position4,6,8. But in the output, position4 remains 0, position6 is5 (remains same), and position8 becomes2. So why only position8?\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe it's not adjacent in all directions but only left and right? Let's see. For the 2 at position5 in the input row, the adjacent 0s would be position4 (left) and position6 (right). But position6 is5, so only position4. But position4 remains 0. Then the 2 at position7 has adjacent 0s at position6 (5) and position8 (0). So position8 becomes2. So that's the only change in this row. So the rule is: for each 2 in the input, convert the right and left 0s to 2 in the same row. But in this case, the right of position7's 2 is 0 (position8), so it becomes2. The left of position5's 2 is position4 (0), but it remains0. So why is position4 not changed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction matters. Only to the right of a 2. Or maybe the conversion is only to the right of a 2.\n\nIn Example0's second row input: [0,5,0,0,0,2,5,2,0,5]. The 2 at position5 is followed by5, so no change. The 2 at position7 is followed by0 (position8), which becomes2. So converting the cell to the right of a 2 to 2 if it's 0. Similarly, in Example1's sixth row, the 2s at positions1-4 are followed by5, then 0s. The 0s are after the5, but they are converted to2. Wait, that doesn't fit. Unless there's a 2 in the previous cell. Like, the 0s are after a 5, but maybe the 5 is followed by 0s which are converted if there's a 2 in the same row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 0 that is followed by a 5 in the same row becomes a 2. Let's check. In Example0's second row, the 0 at position8 is followed by5 (position9), so it becomes2. In Example2's row2, the 0 at position1 is followed by5 (position2), so it becomes2. The 0 at position3 is followed by5 (position4), so becomes2. That seems to fit. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example0's first row input: [0,5,5,5,0,0,2,5,5,5]. The 0s at positions4 and5 are followed by0 and2. So according to this rule, only 0s followed by5 would become2. Here, the 0s are followed by0 and2, so they remain0. Which matches the output where they stay0.\n\nIn Example0's third row input: [0,5,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,0]. The output changes the 0 at position7 (followed by5?) to2. Wait, position7 is0, followed by5 (position8). So according to the rule, this 0 becomes2. Also, the last 0 (position9) is followed by nothing, but maybe if it's the end, it's considered as followed by nothing and thus not changed. But in the output, the last 0 becomes2. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any 0 followed by a 5 becomes2, and any 0 preceded by a 2 becomes2. Let's check. In Example0's second row input: the 0 at position8 is preceded by2 (position7), so becomes2. Also, if a 0 is followed by5, it becomes2. For instance, in Example2's row2 input: 0s at positions1 and3 are followed by5 and5, so become2. That fits.\n\nAnother example: Example1's sixth row input: [5,2,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0]. The 0s are after the5. The first 0 is at position6. It's preceded by5 (position5), followed by0. According to the rule, it's not preceded by2 nor followed by5, so shouldn't change. But in the output, it becomes2. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try a different approach. Perhaps the transformation involves replacing 0s that are either immediately after a 2 or before a 2 in their row. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's second row input: the 0 at position8 is after a 2 at position7. So it becomes2. The other 0s in that row are not adjacent to 2s. For Example2's row2 input, the 0s at positions1 and3 are not adjacent to 2s, but they become2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced by 2s if there's a 2 somewhere to their left in the same row. Let's check Example0's second row input: the 0s after the 2s. The 0 at position8 is after a 2 at position7, so becomes2. In Example2's row2 input, the 0s at positions1 and3 have 5s to their left, but no 2s. So why do they become2s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire grid is scanned, and any 0 that is adjacent (left, right, up, down) to a 2 is replaced by a 2. Let's try this.\n\nFor Example0's second row, position8's 0 is adjacent to the left (2 at position7), so becomes2. For Example2's row2, positions1 and3: in the input, are there any 2s adjacent to them? Let's look at the input for Example2. The input row2 is [5,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5]. The 0 at position1 is surrounded by 5 (left),5 (right), and in rows above and below:\n\nRow1 (input Example2) is [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5]. So column1 in row1 is5. Row3 is [5,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,5,5]. Column1 in row3 is0. So the 0 at row2, position1 has neighbors left5, right5, up5, down0. No 2s adjacent. So why does it become2?\n\nThis is perplexing. Maybe there's a different pattern, such as replacing every other 0 with 2, or counting the number of 0s and converting based on that. But looking at the examples, it's not consistent with that.\n\nWait, looking at Example2's input row2: the output changes the 0s at positions1 and3 to2. Looking at the input row, the 0s are at positions1,3,6. The output changes positions1 and3 to2, but leaves position6 as0. What's different about position6? Let's check the entire row's input and output. In the input row2, the 0 at position6 is followed by5 (position7). So according to the previous hypothesis, if a 0 is followed by5, it becomes2. But in the output, position6 remains0. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that 0s are replaced by 2s if they are between two 5s. For example, in Example2's row2 input, 0 at position1 is between5 (left) and5 (right), so becomes2. Similarly, position3 is between5 (left) and5 (right), becomes2. Position6 is between5 (right) and0 (left?), no. Wait, position6 is0, followed by5 (position7), preceded by0 (position5 is5). Wait, position6 in row2 input is0. Left is position5:5 (row2 input is [5,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5]). So position5 is5, position6 is0, position7 is5. So the 0 at position6 is between5 and5. But in the output, it remains0. So that contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another angle. Maybe the transformation involves looking at the original input and replacing 0s with 2s in specific patterns. For instance, in Example0's output, the 2s form a sort of diagonal or specific shape. But looking at the output, it's not obvious.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the transformation is that any 0 that is part of a contiguous block (horizontal or vertical) that touches a 2 gets converted to 2. Let's check. In Example0's second row input, the 0 at position8 is isolated, but adjacent to a 2 (left), so it becomes2. In Example2's row2 input, the 0s at positions1 and3 are each isolated between5s but not adjacent to any 2s. So why are they converted to2s? Unless there's a 2 in their column. Let's check the columns.\n\nFor Example2's row2, position1: column1. The input's column1 across rows:\n\nRow0:5\nRow1:5\nRow2:0\nRow3:0\nRow4:0\nRow5:5\nRow6:5\nRow7:5\nRow8:5\nRow9:0\n\nNo 2s in column1. So that doesn't explain it.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Perhaps the output is generated by applying a convolution or kernel that detects certain patterns. For example, a kernel that looks for 0s with certain neighboring patterns and replaces them with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s if there is a 2 in the same row, but only for certain positions. For example, every second 0 in a row with a 2 becomes a 2. But in Example0's second row, there are multiple 0s but only one becomes 2.\n\nAlternatively, think about the sum of certain elements. Or perhaps the 2s are propagating to the right. For instance, in Example1's sixth row input, after the 5, there are 0s which are all turned into2. Maybe the 2s from the left (positions1-4) are propagating to the right, but how?\n\nWait, the input row is [5,2,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0]. The output changes the 0s after the5 to2. But there's a5 between the 2s and the 0s. So how does the 2 affect the 0s after the5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that a 0 becomes2 if there's a 2 somewhere to the left in the same row, regardless of distance. In Example1's sixth row input, the 0s after the5 have 2s to the left (positions1-4), so they all become2. In Example0's second row, the 0 at position8 has 2s to the left (positions5 and7), so it becomes2. In Example2's row2 input, the 0s at positions1 and3 have no 2s to the left. The first 2 in that row appears at position6 (which is0). Wait, the input row2 is [5,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5]. There are no 2s in this row. But the output changes positions1 and3 to2. So that contradicts the rule.\n\nWait, in Example2's input row2, there are no 2s. But the output introduces 2s. That suggests that the transformation isn't solely based on existing 2s in the input row. This makes it even more confusing.\n\nAnother approach: compare the inputs and outputs across all examples and see if there's a common transformation. For instance, in all examples, certain 0s become2s. Looking at the test input, perhaps the same pattern applies.\n\nLooking at the test input, which is:\n\n[0,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0]\n[5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5]\n[0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0]\n[0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n[0,0,5,5,5,2,2,0,0,5]\n[5,5,0,0,0,2,2,5,5,5]\n[0,0,5,5,0,2,2,5,5,5]\n[0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0]\n[5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0]\n[5,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nWe need to apply the pattern from the training examples to this test input.\n\nIn Example2's input, certain 0s in the middle of 5s become2. Like in row2 and row3, 0s between5s become2. Perhaps that's a clue.\n\nLooking at the test input's fifth row: [5,5,0,0,0,2,2,5,5,5]. Maybe the 0s adjacent to2s (positions2-4) become2. The output would have those 0s turned into2, but the existing 2s are at positions5-6. So the 0s at positions2-4 are adjacent to2s on the right. So they would become2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s are being replaced by2s if they are in the same row as a2 and are to the right of a5. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll try to hypothesize that the rule is to replace any 0 that is adjacent (left, right, up, or down) to a 2 with a 2. Applying this rule to the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input's fifth row: [5,5,0,0,0,2,2,5,5,5]. The 0s at positions2,3,4 are adjacent to the 2s at positions5 and6. So they should become2. So the output row would be [5,5,2,2,2,2,2,5,5,5]. But looking at the training examples, sometimes only certain 0s are converted. For example, in Example0's row2, the 0 at position8 is next to a2 (left) and becomes2, but the 0s at positions2 and3 are not adjacent to any 2s and remain0.\n\nApplying this rule to the test input, let's check each row.\n\nTest input row4: [0,0,5,5,5,2,2,0,0,5]. The 0s at positions0,1 are adjacent to5s and not 2s. The 2s are at positions5 and6. The 0s at positions7 and8 are adjacent to2s (position6 and5). So these 0s would become2. So the output row would be [0,0,5,5,5,2,2,2,2,5].\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's see what the training examples do. For example, in Example0's row6 input:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]\nOutput: [0,2,0,0,0,0,2,5,2,0]\n\nSo the 0s at positions1,6,8 become2. Looking at their adjacency to2s:\n\nIn the input row6, there are no 2s. But in the output, 2s appear. This suggests that my previous hypothesis is wrong. So there's something else going on.\n\nLooking back at Example0's row6 input and output. Input row6 has no 2s. Output row6 has 2s at positions1,6,8. Where could these come from? Maybe from adjacent rows. Let's check the rows above and below.\n\nRow5 input: [5,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5]\nRow6 input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]\nRow7 input: [0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,5]\n\nIn row6's output, position1 becomes2. Looking at row5's position1 (5), row7's position1 (5). So no 2s in the same column. But how does position1 in row6 get a 2?\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not based on adjacent cells. Maybe the pattern is more complex, like a cellular automaton with specific rules that are not immediately obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace every 0 that is not in the first or last column and is surrounded by 5s with a 2. But in Example0's row6, the 0 at position1 is not surrounded by5s. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: In the training examples, the output seems to have 2s replacing certain 0s. The key is to find which 0s are replaced. Maybe the rule is that any 0 that is between two 5s in the same row becomes a 2. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0's row1 input: [0,5,0,0,0,2,5,2,0,5]. The 0 at position8 is between 2 and5. Not between two5s. But it becomes2. So that's not it.\n\nIn Example2's row2 input: [5,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5]. The 0s at positions1 and3 are between5s. They become2. The 0 at position6 is followed by5 but preceded by5 (position5 is5, position6 is0, position7 is5). So that's between5s, but in the output it remains0. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAt this point, I'm running out of ideas. Given the time I've spent and the competition setting, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input, especially rows with 2s, like row4 and row5. Let's take row5: [5,5,0,0,0,2,2,5,5,5]. The existing 2s are at positions5 and6. The 0s are at positions2-4. If the rule is to replace 0s adjacent to 2s with 2s, then those 0s would become2. So the output for row5 would be [5,5,2,2,2,2,2,5,5,5].\n\nLooking at the training example 2's output, similar patterns where 0s next to 2s are replaced. For instance, in example2's row5 input: [5,5,5,0,5,0,5,0,0,5], output becomes [5,5,5,2,5,0,5,0,0,5]. Only position3 becomes2. But in the input, position3 is0, adjacent to5 and5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that 0s are replaced by 2s if there's a 2 to their right in the same row. In row5 of the test input, the 0s at positions2-4 are to the left of the 2s at positions5-6. So they would become2s. The output would be [5,5,2,2,2,2,2,5,5,5].\n\nAnother observation: in Example0's row6 input, which has no 2s, the output introduces 2s. How is this possible? Looking at the input row6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]. The output is [0,2,0,0,0,0,2,5,2,0]. There are 2s introduced. Perhaps the 5 in position7 has an effect. Maybe 0s adjacent to 5s and certain conditions. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are acting as a kind of barrier, and the 2s spread to the 0s until they hit a 5. For example, in Example1's sixth row input: [5,2,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0], the 2s are to the left of the5, and the 0s to the right of the5 become2. This breaks the previous idea. Unless the 5 is ignored and the 2s spread through the 0s regardless of 5s.\n\nBut in that case, the 0s after the5 would all become2, which is what happens in the output. So maybe the rule is that 0s are replaced by2 if there's a 2 anywhere in the same row, regardless of position. But in Example0's first row, there's a2 but the 0s remain. So that can't be.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation involves replacing 0s with 2s if they are adjacent (left or right) to a2 in the same row. For the test input, I'll apply this rule.\n\nLet's process each row of the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0]. No 2s in the row, so no changes.\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5]. No 2s, so no changes.\n\nRow2: [0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0]. No 2s, so no changes.\n\nRow3: [0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]. No 2s, so no changes.\n\nRow4: [0,0,5,5,5,2,2,0,0,5]. The 2s are at positions5 and6. The 0s at positions7 and8 are to the right of the 2s. So they become2. Also, the 0s to the left of the 2s (positions0 and1) are not adjacent. So output row4 becomes [0,0,5,5,5,2,2,2,2,5].\n\nRow5: [5,5,0,0,0,2,2,5,5,5]. 2s at positions5 and6. The 0s at positions2-4 are to the left. But according to the rule, only adjacent 0s. The 0s at positions2-4 are adjacent to 2s on the right (positions5 and6). So they become2. So row5 becomes [5,5,2,2,2,2,2,5,5,5].\n\nRow6: [0,0,5,5,0,2,2,5,5,5]. 2s at positions5 and6. The 0s at positions4 are to the left of the 2s. So position4 becomes2. Also, check if any 0s are to the right of the 2s. The 2s are at5 and6, followed by5. So no 0s there. So row6 becomes [0,0,5,5,2,2,2,5,5,5].\n\nRow7: [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0]. No 2s, so no changes.\n\nRow8: [5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0]. No 2s, so no changes.\n\nRow9: [5,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0]. No 2s, so no changes.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, sometimes 0s in rows without 2s are converted to2. Like Example0's row6. This suggests that the rule involves more than just same-row 2s. Perhaps vertical adjacency as well.\n\nFor example, in Example0's row6 input, the 0s that become2 might be adjacent to 2s in the same column from other rows. Let's check:\n\nRow6 input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nIn the same column, looking for 2s in other rows. For position1 in row6: column1.\n\nIn the input, column1 has:\n\nRow0:5\n\nRow1:5\n\nRow2:5\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:5\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:5\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:0\n\nNo 2s in column1. So why does position1 become2 in the output?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the transformation isn't purely based on adjacency but another rule. Given time constraints, I'll proceed with the previous assumption for the test input.\n\nApplying the rule: 0s become2 if adjacent to a2 in the same row.\n\nThus, the test output would have:\n\nRow4: [0,0,5,5,5,2,2,2,2,5]\n\nRow5: [5,5,2,2,2,2,2,5,5,5]\n\nRow6: [0,0,5,5,2,2,2,5,5,5]\n\nOther rows remain unchanged.\n\nBut looking at Example2's output, in row5, the 0 at position3 becomes2 even though there's a 5 to the left and right. This suggests another rule. Perhaps the correct pattern is that 0s are replaced by2 if they are in a cell that is adjacent to a 2 either horizontally or vertically. For the test input, this would mean checking all four directions for each 0.\n\nLet's try this for the test input.\n\nTest input row4: [0,0,5,5,5,2,2,0,0,5]\n\nThe 0s at positions7 and8. Let's check their neighbors:\n\nFor position7:\n\nLeft:5 (position6:2)\n\nRight:0 (position8)\n\nUp: row3, position7:5 (row3 is [0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5])\n\nDown: row5, position7:5 (row5 is [5,5,0,0,0,2,2,5,5,5])\n\nSo the left neighbor is2 (row4, position6), so position7 becomes2.\n\nPosition8:\n\nLeft:0 (position7)\n\nRight:0 (position9:5)\n\nUp: row3, position8:5\n\nDown: row5, position8:5\n\nSo the left neighbor in the same row is0 (which remains0). The down neighbor is5. The up neighbor is5. So the only 2 is to the left (position6, same row). So position8's left neighbor is0, but position6 is2. Wait, no. Position7 is0 in the input. So for position8 in row4, the left neighbor is position7 (0), but the left neighbor of position7 is position6 (2). So for position8, the left neighbor is0, but the 2 is two positions left. So according to the rule of immediate adjacency, only position7 would become2. Position8's neighbors are left0, right0, up5, down5. So no 2s adjacent, so remains0. But according to Example0's row6, perhaps vertical neighbors are considered. Wait, row4's position7: in the same column, looking up and down. For column7:\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow3:5\n\nRow5:5\n\nSo no 2s. So position7's only adjacent 2 is to the left in the same row (position6). So becomes2. Position8's left neighbor is0, right is0, up and down are5. So no 2s. So remains0.\n\nBut in Example0's row6, the 0 at position1 becomes2. Looking at column1 in input Example0:\n\nRow0:5\n\nRow1:5\n\nRow2:5\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:5\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:5\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:0\n\nNo 2s in column1. So why does position1 in row6 become2? It's adjacent to no 2s. This suggests that the rule isn't just adjacency.\n\nGiven that I can't figure out the exact rule, I'll proceed with the best guess based on the training examples and apply the rule that 0s adjacent to 2s in the same row (left or right) become2. For the test input, this would change:\n\nRow4: positions7 and8 (adjacent to2 in position6). Wait, position7 is next to position6's2, so becomes2. Position8 is next to position7's0, so remains0. But in Example0's row1, position8 becomes2 because it's next to a2 on the left. So maybe only left adjacency.\n\nAlternatively, in the same row, if there's a2 to the left, the 0 becomes2.\n\nFor row4 in the test input:\n\nThe 0s at positions7 and8. Position7 is to the right of2 at position6. So becomes2. Position8 is to the right of0 (position7), so remains0. So row4 becomes [0,0,5,5,5,2,2,2,0,5]. But in Example0's row1, position8 becomes2 because there's a2 to the left. So perhaps the rule is that any 0 to the right of a2 becomes2.\n\nIn that case, in row5 of the test input, the 0s at positions2-4 are to the left of the2s. So they wouldn't change. But according to Example1's row5, the 0s after a5 but in the same row as2s become2. So perhaps the rule is that any 0 in a row that contains a2 becomes2.\n\nBut in Example0's row0, there's a2 but 0s remain. So that's not it.\n\nAt this point, I'll have to make a decision based on the examples. The correct answer is likely to have 2s added to the test input rows where 0s are adjacent to existing 2s in any direction.\n\nApplying that rule to the test input:\n\nRow4: [0,0,5,5,5,2,2,0,0,5]\n\nThe 0s at positions7 and8 are adjacent to2s at positions5 and6. So becomes2.\n\nRow5: [5,5,0,0,0,2,2,5,5,5]\n\nThe 0s at positions2-4 are adjacent to2s at5 and6. So becomes2.\n\nRow6: [0,0,5,5,0,2,2,5,5,5]\n\nThe 0 at position4 is adjacent to2s at5 and6. So becomes2.\n\nRow4 becomes: [0,0,5,5,5,2,2,2,2,5]\n\nRow5 becomes: [5,5,2,2,2,2,2,5,5,5]\n\nRow6 becomes: [0,0,5,5,2,2,2,5,5,5]\n\nOther rows remain unchanged.\n\nThis matches some of the training examples where 0s adjacent to2s in any direction become2.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 10x10 grid of numbers (0, 2, 5), and the output seems to modify some of these numbers. My job is to see how the input changes to become the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. Let's compare the input and output row by row. For instance, the first row in Example 0's input is [0,5,5,5,0,0,2,5,5,5], and the output is the same. So sometimes rows don't change. But in the second input row [0,5,0,0,0,2,5,2,0,5], the output becomes [0,5,0,0,0,2,5,2,2,5]. The 8th element was 0 and became 2. Hmm. Let's check the third row: input [0,5,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,0] becomes [0,5,5,0,0,0,2,2,5,2]. So positions 7 and 9 changed from 0 to 2. \n\nWait, maybe it's related to neighboring cells. Let's think about how cells are transformed based on their neighbors. For instance, maybe a 0 becomes a 2 if it has certain numbers around it. Alternatively, perhaps 0s that are adjacent to 2s are turning into 2s. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the second row of Example 0's input: the element at position 8 (0-based index 8, which is the 9th element) was 0. In the output, it's 2. Let's check its neighbors. The previous elements are 5,2 (index 6 and 7). Wait, the element before is 2. So maybe if a 0 is next to a 2, it turns into a 2. But then, why in the same row, the 7th element (index 7) was 2 in input and stayed 2. So perhaps there's a directional component. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 0's third row, the input is [0,5,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,0]. The output changes the 7th (index 6) element from 0 to 2? Wait, no. Wait, in input, the element at index 6 is 2. The output's index 7 (original 0) becomes 2, and the last element (index 9) becomes 2. The original 0s at indices 7 and 9. Let's see their neighbors. The 0 at index 7 is between 0 (index 6 is 2) and 0 (index 8 is 5? Wait, the input row is [0,5,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,0]. So indices 6 is 2, index 7 is 0. Then index 8 is 5. So the 0 at index 7 is next to a 2 on the left and 5 on the right. So maybe when a 0 is to the right of a 2, it becomes a 2. Or perhaps it's about being adjacent to 2s in any direction. Wait, but in the output, that 0 became a 2. So perhaps the rule is that a 0 becomes a 2 if it is to the right of a 2. Let me check that.\n\nIn Example 0's second row input, the 8th element (0) in the input row [0,5,0,0,0,2,5,2,0,5] becomes 2. The element before it (index 7) is 2. So the 0 is to the right of a 2, so it changes. Similarly, in the third row's output, the last element (0) becomes 2. The element before it is 5, so that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe it's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's looking at the cell below. Let's consider the grid as a 2D array. For example, in the first example, let's look at row 1, column 8 (input is 0, output is 2). What is the cell below it (row 2, column 8)? In the input, row 2 is [0,5,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,0]. So column 8 is 5. Hmm, perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of adjacent 2s. But in the input, the 0s that turned into 2s in the output might have 2s adjacent in some direction. Let's take another example. In Example 0's output, row 6 (input row 6) is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0], output becomes [0,2,0,0,0,0,2,5,2,0]. So the elements at positions 1 and 6 (0-based) become 2. Let's check their neighbors in the input. The original row is all 0s except for position 7 (5). So for position 1 in row 6: input is 0. The neighbors in the input grid would be the cells above (row 5), below (row 7), left (position 0), and right (position 2). Let's see:\n\nRow 6, position 1: neighbors are:\n\nAbove: row5, position1: in input, row5 is [5,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5]. So row5 pos1 is 5.\n\nLeft: row6 pos0 is 0.\n\nRight: row6 pos2 is 0.\n\nBelow: row7 pos1: input row7 is [0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,5]. So row7 pos1 is 5.\n\nSo the 0 at row6 pos1 has neighbors: 5 (above), 0 (left), 0 (right), 5 (below). So why did it turn into 2? There's no 2 adjacent. Hmm, maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is not based on the original input but on previous steps. But since each row in the output is modified, perhaps the transformation is applied row by row, left to right. Let's think about that.\n\nSuppose that in each row, we process each element from left to right. If an element is 0 and the previous element in the same row (to the left) is 2, then this 0 becomes 2. Let's test this.\n\nTake Example0's second row input: [0,5,0,0,0,2,5,2,0,5]. Output is [0,5,0,0,0,2,5,2,2,5]. Let's process each element:\n\n- First element is 0. Previous is nothing, stays 0.\n\n- Second element is 5. Stays 5.\n\n- Third element 0. Previous is 5, no change.\n\n- Fourth 0: previous is 0, no change.\n\n- Fifth 0: previous is 0.\n\n- Sixth element 2: stays 2.\n\n- Seventh 5: stays.\n\n- Eighth 2: stays.\n\n- Ninth element 0: previous element is 2 (eighth position). So this 0 becomes 2. Which matches the output.\n\n- Tenth 5: stays.\n\nSo that works for the ninth element. What about the third row's output. Input row is [0,5,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,0]. Output becomes [0,5,5,0,0,0,2,2,5,2]. Let's process left to right:\n\n- Elements 0: 0,5,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,0.\n\nStart processing:\n\nPosition 0: 0 \u2192 remains 0.\n\n1:5 \u21925.\n\n2:5\u21925.\n\n3:0 \u2192 previous is 5, so no change.\n\n4:0 \u2192 previous 0.\n\n5:0 \u2192 previous 0.\n\n6:2\u21922.\n\n7:0 \u2192 previous is 2 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\n8:5 \u21925.\n\n9:0 \u2192 previous is 5 \u2192 no change. Wait, but in the output, position9 is 2. So this doesn't fit. Hmm. So according to this rule, position9 would not change, but in the output it's 2. So maybe there's another component here.\n\nWait in the output of third row, the last element is 2. So according to the previous rule, the element before it is 5 (position8 is 5 in input), so the 0 at position9 would not change. But in the output, it's 2. So that contradicts the previous idea. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are turned into 2s if the next element (to the right) is a 2. Let's check. For the third row's position7 (input 0) becomes 2. The next element is 5 (position8). So that wouldn't fit. So maybe it's the other way around. Or maybe both left and right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about being adjacent to a 2 in the same row in the input. Let's check the third row input: [0,5,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,0]. The 0 at position7 (original) is between 2 (position6) and 0 (position8). So if the left neighbor is 2, then it becomes 2. That's the case here. Position7's left is 2 (position6), so it becomes 2. Similarly, position9 in the same row: its left neighbor is 5 (position8), so why does it become 2 in the output? That's a problem. So maybe there's another condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the 0s are turned into 2s if they are adjacent (either left or right) to a 2 in the input. Let's check:\n\nIn the third row's input, the 0 at position7 (index7) is to the right of a 2 (index6). So it becomes 2. The last element (index9) is 0. Its left neighbor is 5 (index8). So why did it become 2? Hmm. Maybe that's not the rule. Alternatively, maybe it's looking at the cell above.\n\nWait, in the input grid, the third row is row 2. Let's check row1 (the row above it) in the input. Row1 (second row) in input is [0,5,0,0,0,2,5,2,0,5]. So row1's position9 is 5. The current row (row2) position9 is 0. So maybe if the cell above is a 2, then it becomes 2. But the cell above is 5. Hmm. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell below. Let's check row3 in input. Row3 is [5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,5]. So row3's position9 is 5. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look for another pattern. Looking at the outputs, the 2s seem to spread to the right or in some direction. For example, in Example1's fifth input row is [5,2,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0], and the output becomes [5,2,2,2,2,5,2,2,2,2]. So the 0s after the 5 in position5 (which is 5) are turned into 2s. Wait, but in the input row, the 5 is at position5. The elements after that are 0s. But in the output, they become 2s. How?\n\nWait, in that example, the input row is [5,2,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0]. Output is same except positions 6-9 become 2. So the 0s following the 5 in position5 are turned into 2s. But why? The 5 is not a 2. So perhaps the rule isn't about adjacent 2s. Maybe there's a different condition.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any 0 that is between two 2s (or adjacent to a 2 and another number) becomes a 2. But in Example1's fifth row, the 0s are after a 5 and before nothing. So that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that 0s are replaced by 2s if they are in positions that are surrounded by certain numbers in the input grid. But this could be too vague.\n\nWait, looking at Example2's input and output. Let's take the third row input [5,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,5,5] becomes [5,2,5,2,5,5,0,0,5,5]. So the 0s at positions1 and 3 in the input become 2. What's around them? Let's check the same row:\n\nIn the input row, positions1 and 3 are 0. Their left and right neighbors:\n\nPosition1: left is 5 (pos0), right is5 (pos2). So 5 and 5. Hmm. In the output, it's 2. Why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe if a 0 is between two 5s, it becomes a 2. But in that case, position1 is between 5 and 5. So that's possible. But let's check other examples. For example, in Example0's second row input, the 0 at position8 (input 0) becomes 2. Its left neighbor is 2 (position7), right is 5. So that's not between two 5s. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is that 0s are turned into 2s if they are in a cell that is directly below a 5. Let's check. For Example0's third row, the 0 at position9 (input 0) becomes 2. The cell above (row2, column9) is 0 (from input row2: [0,5,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,0], so column9 is 0). So that's not a 5. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced by 2s if they are to the right of a 5 in the same row. Let's see. For Example0's second row, the 0 at position8 (input 0) becomes 2. The element before it (position7) is 2. So that's not a 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me think of another angle. Perhaps the output is the input but with all 0s that are adjacent (left, right, up, down) to a 2 in the input grid are replaced with 2. Let's test this.\n\nTake Example0's first row input: no 2s except at position6. The 0s in that row are positions0,4,5. Are any of them adjacent to a 2? Let's check. The 2 is at position6. The adjacent cells would be position5 (0), which is next to 2. So position5 is 0, adjacent to 2. But in the output, the first row's position5 remains 0. So this idea is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s in the output are the ones that are to the right of a 2 in the same row. Let's check Example0's second row. The 0 at position8 becomes 2. The element to the left (position7) is 2. So yes. Similarly, in Example0's third row, the 0 at position7 becomes 2 (left is 2). The 0 at position9 becomes 2, but the left is 5. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the next element after a 2. For example, after a 2 in a row, the following 0s become 2s until a non-0 is found. Let's check Example1's fifth row input: [5,2,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0]. The output changes the 0s to 2s starting from position6. The 5 is at position5. So after the 5, the 0s are turned into 2s? That doesn't fit. But in the output, they are 2s. But the 5 is not a 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps whenever there's a 2 in a row, all 0s to the right of it in the same row are turned into 2s. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0's second row input: [0,5,0,0,0,2,5,2,0,5]. The 2s are at positions5 and7. The 0s after position5 (positions6 is 5, so no. The 0s after position7 are positions8 (0) and9 (5). So position8 is after position7's 2, so it becomes 2. Which matches the output. Then in the third row input: [0,5,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,0]. The 2 is at position6. The 0s after it are positions7,8 (5),9 (0). So position7 is 0, which is after the 2. So it becomes 2. Position9 is 0, not after the 2. So it becomes 2? But in the output, position9 becomes 2. So that contradicts. So maybe this rule isn't correct.\n\nHmm. Let's look for another pattern. Looking at the outputs, in some rows, the 0s are replaced by 2s. The pattern of replacement seems to be that 0s are replaced by 2s when they are adjacent to the right or below a 2. Or maybe there's a diagonal component.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any 0 that is surrounded by 5s in certain directions gets turned into a 2. For example, in Example2's third row input, the 0s at positions1 and3 are surrounded by 5s on either side (left and right). Those 0s become 2. Let's see:\n\nInput row3: [5,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,5,5]. Output is [5,2,5,2,5,5,0,0,5,5]. So the 0s at positions1 and3 are between 5s. So they turn into 2. Similarly, in Example0's third row, the 0 at position7 is between a 2 and a 5. So that might not fit, but in the output it's 2. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of 5s around the 0. For example, if a 0 has two 5s adjacent (like left and right), it becomes a 2. But then in Example0's second row, the 0 at position8 is next to 2 and 5. So not two 5s. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of the cell's value and the cell below. For example, if a 0 has a 5 below it, it becomes a 2. Let's check. Take Example0's second row position8 (0) which becomes 2. The cell below (row3) at position8 is 0. So no.\n\nThis is challenging. Let me try to find a different approach. Let's look for all the changes between input and output in the training examples and see if there's a common rule.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow0: no changes.\n\nRow1: 0 at position8 \u2192 2.\n\nRow2: 0s at positions7 and9 \u2192 2.\n\nRow3: 0 at position8 \u2192 2.\n\nRow5: 0 at position7 \u21922.\n\nRow6: 0s at positions1,6,8 \u21922.\n\nRow7: 0s at positions0,2,6,7 \u21922.\n\nRow8: 0s at positions1,5,7 \u21922.\n\nRow9: 0 at position6 \u21922.\n\nLooking at these, perhaps the rule is that a 0 turns into a 2 if there's a 2 somewhere to the left in the same row and before a 5. Or maybe it's a matter of the 0 being in a position where there's a 2 earlier in the row and no 5 between them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that after the first occurrence of a 2 in a row, all subsequent 0s are turned into 2s until a 5 is encountered. Let's check this.\n\nTake Example0's row1: [0,5,0,0,0,2,5,2,0,5]. The first 2 is at position5. The elements after are 5,2,0,5. So after the first 2 (position5), there's a 5 at position6. So the 0 at position8 comes after position5's 2 but after a 5. Wait, but the output's row1 changes position8 to 2. Hmm. So perhaps after the first 2, all 0s are turned into 2s regardless of what's in between. But in row1's input, after position5 (2), there's a 5, then a 2 (position7), then 0. So the 0 at position8 is after the first 2. But there are 5s and another 2 in between. So if the rule is to change all 0s after the first 2, then position8 would be changed. Which matches the output. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nTake Example0's row2 input: [0,5,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,0]. First 2 is at position6. The elements after are 0,5,0. So according to the rule, any 0 after position6 would become 2. The 0s at positions7 and9 (since they are after position6) become 2. Which matches the output (positions7 and9 are 2).\n\nExample0's row3 input: [5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,5]. First 2 in the row? Wait, there are no 2s in the input row3. But in the output row3, the 0 at position8 becomes 2. So this contradicts the rule. Because there's no 2 in the input row3. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nHmm. So maybe another approach is needed. Let's look at Example2's input and output. For instance, in row2's input: [5,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5]. Output becomes [5,2,5,2,5,5,0,5,5,5]. Wait, but in the input, the first 0 is at position1. Why did that become 2? There's no 2 in the row. So perhaps the rule is not based on the same row's elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being changed to 2s if there's a 2 in the same column in the previous row. Let's check Example0's row3, column8. Input is 0. Output is 2. Let's look at row2, column8: in input row2, column8 is 5. So no 2 there. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the cell below. For Example0's row1, column8 (input 0 \u2192 output 2). The cell below is row2, column8: 5. No. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let me think of a different approach. Let's see the difference between input and output for each example. For example, in Example0's output, many 0s become 2s. Let's count the changes. For each row, note where 0 \u21922.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow1: 0\u21922 at position8.\n\nRow2: 0\u21922 at positions7,9.\n\nRow3: 0\u21922 at position8.\n\nRow5: 0\u21922 at position7.\n\nRow6: 0\u21922 at positions1,6,8.\n\nRow7: 0\u21922 at positions0,2,6,7.\n\nRow8: 0\u21922 at positions1,5,7.\n\nRow9: 0\u21922 at position6.\n\nNow, looking for a common pattern in these positions.\n\nFor row1's position8: in input, the same row has a 2 at positions5 and7. So maybe if there's a 2 to the left in the same row, the 0 is converted. But position8 is after position7's 2.\n\nIn row2's position7: same row has a 2 at position6. So to the left. Then position7 becomes 2. Position9 in row2 is 0, becomes 2. But in the same row, after position6's 2, there's 0 (position7) which becomes 2, then 5, then 0 (position9). So why does position9 become 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a matter of the 0 being in a position that is either to the right of a 2 in the same row or below a 2 in the previous row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 0 that is in a cell that is surrounded by 5s on both left and right becomes 2. For example, in Example2's third row, positions1 and3 are 0s surrounded by 5s. They become 2s. But in Example0's row1 position8 is 0, left is 2 and right is5. Not surrounded by 5s. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is similar to a cellular automaton where 0s turn into 2s based on certain neighboring conditions. For example, if a 0 has a 2 in any of the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right), then it becomes a 2. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's row1 position8 (0) becomes 2. Let's check neighbors:\n\nLeft neighbor: position7 is 2 \u2192 yes.\n\nRight neighbor: position9 is5.\n\nAbove: row0 position8 is5.\n\nBelow: row2 position8 is5.\n\nSo only left neighbor is 2. So the rule is met. So this 0 becomes 2.\n\nRow2's position7: left is 2 (position6). So yes.\n\nRow2's position9: left is5. But in output, it becomes 2. So that's a problem. The neighbors are:\n\nLeft:5, right:none (edge), above: row1 position9 is5, below: row3 position9 is5. So no 2s around. So why does it become 2?\n\nHmm, this contradicts the rule. So maybe the rule isn't just adjacent cells.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is applied in multiple passes. For example, in the first pass, some 0s become 2s based on certain conditions, then in the next pass, those new 2s cause more 0s to change. But since the examples are static, maybe the output is the result of applying such a rule once.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the input with certain 0s replaced by 2s where those 0s are part of a path that's connected to a 2 via certain directions. For example, 0s that are reachable from a 2 by moving right or down. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the pattern where 0s that are between 5s in a certain way become 2s. For example, if a 0 is flanked by 5s on the left and right, or above and below. But Example0's row6 has 0s that become 2s without being between 5s.\n\nLet me check another example. Take Example0's row6 input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]. Output: [0,2,0,0,0,0,2,5,2,0]. The 0s at positions1,6,8 become 2. Looking at their neighbors:\n\nPosition1: left is0, right is0. Above (row5) is5,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5 \u2192 position1 is5. Below (row7) is0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,5 \u2192 position1 is5. So neighbors above and below are 5. So maybe that's why it becomes 2.\n\nPosition6: in row6 input is0. Above (row5) is0 (from row5's position6: [5,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5] \u2192 position6 is0. Below (row7) is0. Left is0, right is0. So no. But in output, position6 becomes2. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to hypothesize a rule that can explain as many cases as possible.\n\nAfter looking at multiple examples, I notice that in the output, 0s are replaced by 2s in positions where either the cell to the left or the cell above is a 2. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's row1 position8: cell to the left is 2 (same row), so becomes 2.\n\nRow2 position7: cell to the left is 2 (same row), becomes 2.\n\nRow3 position8: cell above (row2's position8) is5, but maybe cell to the left is5 (row3's position7 is5). So no.\n\nRow6 position1: cell above (row5 position1 is5) and cell to the left is0. But in output it's 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the cell to the left or the cell above is a 2 in the input.\n\nExample0's row1 position8: cell to the left is2 in input, so becomes 2.\n\nRow2 position7: cell to the left is2 (input row2 position6 is2), becomes 2.\n\nRow2 position9: cell to the left is5 (input row2 position8 is5). But in output, it's 2. So this rule doesn't explain that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a 0 is between two 5s in the same row, it becomes a 2. For example, in Example2's third row, the 0s at positions1 and3 are between 5s. They become 2. But in Example0's row6 position1: input is0, and left and right are0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of the cell above and to the left. For example, if either the cell to the left or the cell above is a 2, then the 0 becomes 2.\n\nExample0's row1 position8: left is2, so yes.\n\nRow2 position7: left is2, yes.\n\nRow3 position8: above is row2 position8 is5, left is row3's position7 is5. So no.\n\nRow6 position1: cell above (row5 position1 is5), left is0. So no. So this rule doesn't explain.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, except whenever there's a 2 in the input, all 0s to the right of it in the same row and up to the next 5 are turned into 2s. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's row1: input has 2s at positions5 and7. After each 2, the 0s to the right until a 5 are turned into 2s.\n\nPosition5 is2. Next elements are 5 (position6). So no 0s after. Then position7 is2. The next elements are 0 (position8) and5 (position9). So position8 becomes2.\n\nIn row2's input: 2 at position6. The next elements are 0 (position7),5 (position8),0 (position9). So turning position7 into2. But in the output, position9 is also 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's row5: input has 2s up to position4, then 5 at position5. The 0s after position5 (positions6-9) become2. So the 5 at position5 stops the conversion. So after the 2s, the 0s become2 until the next 5.\n\nBut in Example1's row5 input: [5,2,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0]. The 0s after the 5 at position5 (positions6-9) are turned into2. But the 5 is not a 2, so according to this rule, why are they turned into2? Maybe the rule is different. Perhaps whenever there's a 2 in the row, all 0s after any 2 are turned into2, regardless of 5s.\n\nBut in Example1's row5, after the 2s (positions1-4), there's a 5 at position5. Then positions6-9 are 0s. But in the output, they are 2s. So according to the rule, after any 2 in the row, all 0s to the right are turned into2. So in this case, the 0s after the 2s (even after a 5) are turned into2. That seems to fit.\n\nExample0's row2 input has a 2 at position6. All 0s to the right (positions7,9) become2. Position8 is5, so it's skipped. So in the output, positions7 and9 are 2. Which matches.\n\nExample0's row3 input has no 2s, so no changes. But in the output, row3's position8 is0\u21922. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. So this rule works for some examples but not all.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0's output, the 2s seem to form a sort of \"flow\" to the right and down. Maybe it's a two-pass process where first 2s spread to the right, then down. Or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be that every 0 that has a 2 either to the left in the same row or above in the same column is turned into a 2.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's row1 position8: left is2. So becomes2.\n\nRow2 position7: left is2. So becomes2.\n\nRow2 position9: left is5. But in output, it's 2. What's the cell above (row1 position9) is5. So no. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample0's row3 position8: input is0. The cell above (row2 position8) is5, and left is5 (row3 position7). So no. But output is2. So this rule doesn't explain.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's think of the test input and see if we can find a pattern there. Maybe the test input's output will help us reverse-engineer.\n\nTest input rows include [0,0,5,5,5,2,2,0,0,5]. The output may turn some 0s into2s. For example, in the fifth row of the test input: [5,5,0,0,0,2,2,5,5,5]. The output might change the 0s before the 2s into2s, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that 0s are replaced by 2s if they are in the same row and column as a 2 in the input, but that's vague.\n\nAnother observation: in all training examples, the outputs introduce 2s in positions that are 0s in the input. The 2s in the input are preserved, and new 2s are added. The pattern of added 2s seems to be in positions adjacent (left, right, below, or above) to existing 2s. But how?\n\nWait, in Example0's row6 input is all 0s except position7. The output has 2s at positions1,6,8. Let's check if these 0s are adjacent to any 2s in the input grid:\n\nPosition1: in row6. Check adjacent cells in input grid:\n\nAbove (row5): [5,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5]. Position1 is5.\n\nBelow (row7): [0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,5]. Position1 is5.\n\nLeft (row6 position0):0.\n\nRight (row6 position2):0.\n\nSo no 2s adjacent. But in output, it becomes 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in a diagonal pattern. For example, if a cell is diagonally adjacent to a 2, then it becomes 2. Let's check.\n\nExample0's row6 position1:\n\nDiagonally adjacent cells: row5 position0 (5), row5 position2 (0), row7 position0 (0), row7 position2 (0). No 2s. So no.\n\nThis is frustrating. Maybe the pattern is that every 0 that is either to the right of a 2 or below a 2 in the input is turned into a 2.\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample0's row1 position8: to the right of position7's2. So yes.\n\nRow2 position7: to the right of position6's2. Yes.\n\nRow2 position9: not directly to the right of any 2. So no. But in output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if a 0 is below a 2 (same column, row+1), then it becomes 2.\n\nExample0's row1 position8: column8. The cell above is row0 position8:5. Not a 2. So no.\n\nRow6 position1: column1. The cell above is row5 position1:5. Not a 2.\n\nHmm. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the 2s in the output are all the 0s that are in the same row as a 2 and are followed by a 5. Or preceded by a 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the numbers as directions. Maybe 5s are walls and 2s are sources that \"spread\" to 0s in certain directions. For example, 2s spread to the right until they hit a 5. Let's see:\n\nIn Example1's fifth row input: [5,2,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0]. The 2s are followed by a 5, and after the 5 are 0s. In the output, those 0s become 2s. So perhaps 2s can spread through 5s? Or maybe the 5s are ignored and the 0s after are converted. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe after all 2s in a row, any 0s to the right are converted to 2s regardless of what's in between.\n\nThis seems to fit Example1's fifth row. The 0s after the 2s (even after a 5) become 2s. So the rule could be: in each row, after the first occurrence of a 2, all subsequent 0s are turned into 2s.\n\nBut Example0's row3 input has no 2s, but in the output, a 0 becomes 2. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that in each row, after any 2, all 0s to the right are turned into 2s.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's row1 input has 2s at positions5 and7. So after position5, the elements are5,2,0,5. The 0 at position8 is after a 2 (position7), so it becomes 2.\n\nExample0's row2 has a 2 at position6. After that are 0,5,0. So the 0s at positions7 and9 are after the 2 and become 2.\n\nExample1's row5 input has 2s up to position4. After that, 5 and 0s. The 0s after any 2 would be positions6-9. They become 2s.\n\nExample2's row2 input has a 2 at position6. After that are 0,5,5,5. So the 0 at position6 becomes 0 in output (no change?), but in Example2's row2 output, position6 is0. Wait, input row2 is [5,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5]. Output is [5,2,5,2,5,5,0,5,5,5]. So the 0s at positions1 and3 become 2. These are before any 2s. So this rule doesn't apply here.\n\nThis suggests that the rule is different. Perhaps the transformation is applied in a way that depends on both the row and column. For instance, certain columns are more likely to have 0s turned into 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in the output, every 0 that is in the same column as a 2 in the input grid is turned into a 2. For example, if any row in the input has a 2 in a certain column, then all 0s in that column are turned into 2s.\n\nLet's check Example0's column6. In the input, row0 has 2 in column6. So in the output, all 0s in column6 become 2. Looking at Example0's output:\n\nRow6, column6: input was0, output is2. Which fits. Row7, column6: input was0, output is2. Which also fits. So this could be a possible rule.\n\nBut let's check other columns. For example, column7 in Example0's input has 2s in rows0 (5), row1 (2), row2 (0), etc. The output has 2s in some rows but not all.\n\nWait, column6 in input has 2s in row0, row1, row2, etc. In the output, all 0s in column6 are replaced with 2. Let's check:\n\nExample0's input column6 has 2 in row0, row1 (5?), no. Let me recheck:\n\nExample0's input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,5,5,5,0,0,2,5,5,5] \u2192 column6 is2.\n\nRow1: [0,5,0,0,0,2,5,2,0,5] \u2192 column6 is5.\n\nRow2: [0,5,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,0] \u2192 column6 is2.\n\nRow3: [5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,5] \u2192 column6 is0.\n\nRow4: [5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0] \u2192 column6 is0.\n\nRow5: [5,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5] \u2192 column6 is0.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0] \u2192 column6 is0.\n\nRow7: [0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,5] \u2192 column6 is0.\n\nRow8: [5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5] \u2192 column6 is5.\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0] \u2192 column6 is0.\n\nSo in column6 of the input, there are 2s in row0 and row2. So according to the hypothesis, all 0s in column6 of the output would become 2. Let's check the output:\n\nExample0's output column6:\n\nRow0:2.\n\nRow1:5.\n\nRow2:2.\n\nRow3:0 \u2192 in input was0. But output is0. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nSo this can't be the rule.\n\nThis is taking too long, and I need to provide an answer. Let's try to find a different angle. Perhaps the pattern is that each row is transformed such that every 0 that is followed by a 5 is replaced with a 2. Let's test:\n\nExample0's row1: 0 at position8 is followed by5. So becomes2.\n\nRow2: 0 at position7 is followed by5. So becomes2. 0 at position9 is last element, not followed by anything. So no, but it becomes2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: every 0 that is immediately followed by a 5 or 2 is replaced with a 2.\n\nExample0's row1 position8: followed by5 \u2192 becomes2.\n\nRow2 position7: followed by5 \u2192 becomes2.\n\nRow2 position9: followed by nothing \u2192 becomes2. So no.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any 0 that is preceded by a 2 in the same row is replaced by a 2. Let's check:\n\nExample0's row1 position8: preceded by2 \u2192 becomes2.\n\nRow2 position7: preceded by2 \u2192 becomes2.\n\nRow2 position9: preceded by5 \u2192 no. So this doesn't explain.\n\nRow6 position1: preceded by0 \u2192 no.\n\nBut in the output, row6 position1 is2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAfter struggling, I think the pattern might be that any 0 in the input is replaced by a 2 if there's a 2 somewhere in the same row, and the 0 is to the right of the leftmost 2 in that row. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's row1: leftmost 2 is at position5. Any 0 to the right (positions6-9) would become2. But in row1's input, position6 is5, position7 is2, position8 is0, position9 is5. So position8 is0 to the right of leftmost 2. So it becomes2. Which fits.\n\nRow2's leftmost 2 is at position6. Positions7-9 are0,5,0. So position7 becomes2 (0 to the right), position9 becomes2 (0 to the right). So this fits.\n\nExample1's row5: leftmost 2 is at position1. All positions to the right (2-9) have 2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0. So after the leftmost 2, any 0s to the right become2. Which fits the output.\n\nExample0's row3: no 2s, so no changes. But in the output, row3's position8 is2. So this contradicts.\n\nSo this rule explains most cases except for row3 in Example0.\n\nHmm. But perhaps there's another rule for when there's no 2 in the row. Maybe in that case, the 0s are replaced by 2 if there's a 2 in the same column in the input.\n\nExample0's row3 position8: column8. Checking input column8:\n\nRow0:5.\n\nRow1:0.\n\nRow2:5.\n\nRow3:0.\n\nRow4:5.\n\nRow5:5.\n\nRow6:0.\n\nRow7:0.\n\nRow8:5.\n\nRow9:5.\n\nNo 2s in column8 of the input. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the patterns I've observed.\n\nThe most consistent pattern seems to be that after the first occurrence of a 2 in a row, all subsequent 0s are replaced by 2s. Additionally, if a row has no 2s, but the row below has a 2 in the same column, then the 0 is replaced by 2. Or another similar condition.\n\nBut given the limited time, I'll proceed with the first part of the rule: in each row, after the first occurrence of a 2, all 0s to the right are replaced by 2s.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow0: 0,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0 \u2192 looking for first 2. None. So no changes.\n\nNext row: [5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5] \u2192 no 2s. No changes.\n\nRow2: [0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0] \u2192 no 2s. No changes.\n\nRow3: [0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5] \u2192 no 2s. No changes.\n\nRow4: [0,0,5,5,5,2,2,0,0,5] \u2192 first 2 at position5. All 0s after that (positions7,8) become2.\n\nRow5: [5,5,0,0,0,2,2,5,5,5] \u2192 first 2 at position5. 0s to the right before 5 (positions2,3,4) become2.\n\nRow6: [0,0,5,5,0,2,2,5,5,5] \u2192 first 2 at position5. 0s to the right (positions4) become2.\n\nRow7: [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0] \u2192 no 2s. No changes.\n\nRow8: [5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0] \u2192 no 2s. No changes.\n\nRow9: [5,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0] \u2192 no 2s. No changes.\n\nWait, but the test input's row4 has 2s starting at position5. So according to the rule, after the first 2 (position5), the 0s at positions7,8 (which are 0 and0) become2. So the row4 output would be [0,0,5,5,5,2,2,2,2,5].\n\nRow5: first 2 at position5. The 0s to the right (positions2,3,4) are0,0,0 \u2192 become2. So row5 becomes [5,5,2,2,2,2,2,5,5,5].\n\nRow6: first 2 at position5. The 0s to the right (position4 is0) becomes2. So row6 becomes [0,0,5,5,2,2,2,5,5,5].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, sometimes there are 2s introduced in rows without any 2s in the input. For example, in Example0's row3, which has no 2s in the input, but the output has a 2. So the rule must be more complex.\n\nBut given time constraints, I'll proceed with the first rule and adjust based on the training examples.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0's row3, the input has no 2s. But in the output, position8 (0) becomes2. Looking at the row below (row4) in input, position8 is5. So not a 2. Hmm.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll apply the rule where in each row, after the first 2, all subsequent 0s are replaced by 2s, and see if that fits the test input.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0] \u2192 no 2s \u2192 remains same.\n\nRow1: [5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5] \u2192 no 2s \u2192 same.\n\nRow2: [0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0] \u2192 no 2s \u2192 same.\n\nRow3: [0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5] \u2192 no 2s \u2192 same.\n\nRow4: [0,0,5,5,5,2,2,0,0,5] \u2192 first 2 at position5. 0s after that: positions7,8 \u2192 become2. So output row: [0,0,5,5,5,2,2,2,2,5].\n\nRow5: [5,5,0,0,0,2,2,5,5,5] \u2192 first 2 at position5. 0s after that: positions2,3,4 \u2192 become2. So output row: [5,5,2,2,2,2,2,5,5,5].\n\nRow6: [0,0,5,5,0,2,2,5,5,5] \u2192 first 2 at position5. 0s after: position4 (0) becomes2. So output row: [0,0,5,5,2,2,2,5,5,5].\n\nRow7: [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0] \u2192 no 2s \u2192 same.\n\nRow8: [5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0] \u2192 no 2s \u2192 same.\n\nRow9: [5,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0] \u2192 no 2s \u2192 same.\n\nBut comparing this to the training examples, especially Example0's row3 where there are no 2s in the input but the output has a 2, this approach may miss some cases. But given time constraints, this is the best I can do.",
