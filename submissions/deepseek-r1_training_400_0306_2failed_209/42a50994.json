        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples provided. Then, apply that pattern to the test input to get the final output. Let's start by analyzing the examples one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nIn the input, there are multiple 8s in some rows. The output seems to have some of those 8s removed. Let's compare the input and output rows. For instance, the third input row is [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0] and the output is [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the first 8 stays, but the others are gone. Similarly, the sixth input row is [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0], and the output is [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So again, the first 8 remains, others are removed. Wait, but in some rows, like the second input row [8,0,0...], the output is the same. Hmm. Maybe the pattern is to keep only the first occurrence of the number (like 8 in example 0) and set the rest to zero? Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a lot of 6s. The output seems to have some 6s removed. For example, the second input row in example1 is [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,6...], and the output is [0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6...]. So the first 6 is kept, the others are removed. But there's a 6 later in the output. Wait, maybe the rule is that only the first occurrence of the number in each row is kept, and the rest are set to zero. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the input of example1, the second row's output has the first 6, then the next 6s in positions 5, 8, 10 are set to zero. But the output row has a 6 in position 10. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The input row is [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0], and the output is [0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. Hmm, the 6s at positions 1, 10, and 14 are kept. Wait, that doesn't fit the first occurrence idea. So maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that for each row, any number (like 8,6,5,4 in examples) is kept only if it's the first occurrence in that row. So, only the first instance of the non-zero number in each row is kept, and all others are set to zero. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0's first input row [0,8,0,0,...], the output is the same. Because the 8 is the first and only occurrence. Second input row [8,0,0...] remains the same. Third input row [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0] becomes [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the first 8 (position 4) stays, the others at positions 7 and 9 are zeroed. That matches. Similarly, in the fourth input row of example0, the 8 is at position4, and in output it's kept. The fifth input row has 8s at positions2 and3. The output is [0,0,8,8,0...], but wait, the output for that row is [0,0,8,8,0...]. Wait, but that would mean both 8s are kept, which contradicts the first occurrence idea. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's input row 5: [0,0,8,8,0...]. The output for that row is [0,0,8,8,0...]. Wait, that's the same as the input. But according to the output given, maybe the pattern is different. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the fifth input row in example0 is [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], and the output is [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Oh right, so the first 8 in position3 is kept, the one at position8 is removed. So yes, first occurrence is kept, others are set to zero. But then why in the fifth input row of example0, the input has two 8s, and in the output only the first is kept. Similarly, in the sixth input row of example0, the input has 8s at positions2 and6. The output keeps the first (position2) and zeros the others. So the pattern seems to be: for each row, keep the first occurrence of the non-zero number (like 8,6,5,4 depending on the example) and set all other occurrences of that number in the row to zero. But in example1's third input row, let's see: [0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,6,0,0,6]. The output is [0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. So the first 6 is kept (position1), the next 6s at position9, 10, 15, 17 are all set to zero except the first. Wait, in the output, the 6 at position14 (original input's position14) is kept. Wait, maybe there's something else. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that for each row, if there's a non-zero number, all but the first occurrence (leftmost) are set to zero. So regardless of their positions, only the first non-zero (leftmost) is kept, and others are zeroed. Wait, but in example0, the fifth input row is [0,0,8,8,0...], but output is [0,0,8,8,0...]? Wait no, in example0's fifth input row is [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]. The output is [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So only the first 8 (position3) is kept. The next 8 at position8 is zeroed. So yes, first occurrence per row is kept, others are zeroed.\n\nWait, in example3's input row 0: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0]. The output is [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]. So the first 4 at position5 is kept, the next one at position7 is zeroed. That fits.\n\nIn example1's second input row: [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. The output is [0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. Wait, here, the first 6 is kept (position1), then the next 6s at positions5, 8, 10, and14. But in the output, the 6 at position10 and 14 are kept. Wait, this contradicts the previous pattern. Unless the numbers in the output are not the same as the input. Wait, maybe the pattern is different. Let's check that example again.\n\nWait, input example1's second row: [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. Output is [0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. So in the output, the 6s are at positions1, 10, and14. But in the input, those are the positions1,5,8,10,14. So the first 6 is at position1. The output keeps the first 6, but why are positions10 and14 still 6? That doesn't fit the pattern. Unless the pattern is different. Hmm, maybe there's another rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to keep the first occurrence of each unique number in the row. But all the examples have only one non-zero number (like all 8s, 6s, etc.). So in each example, the non-zero numbers are the same in each row. So maybe the rule is: in each row, retain the first occurrence of the non-zero number (which is the same throughout the row) and set all others to zero. That would explain the examples. Let's check example1's second row again. The input has 6s in positions1,5,8,10,14. The output keeps positions1,10,14? That doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps the output is not the same as the first occurrence. Maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each row is transformed by keeping the leftmost non-zero element and setting all other non-zero elements to zero. But in example0's fifth input row, the row starts with 0s, so the first non-zero is 8 in position3. Then all other 8s are set to zero. That fits. Example1's second input row: the first non-zero is 6 in position1. The output keeps that and zeros the rest. But the output in example1's second row has 6 at position10 and14. So that contradicts. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in looking at the example. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at example1's input and output again:\n\nInput row 1 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's see). The second example's input's first row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output is the same. So the first non-zero is 6 at position11. The output keeps that. So that fits. Then, the next row in input is [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. The output is [0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. So the first 6 is at position1, then there's a 6 at position10 and14. Wait, but according to the 'leftmost non-zero' rule, only the first 6 should be kept, the rest set to zero. But in the output, there are 6s in positions1,10,14. So this breaks the pattern. Therefore, my previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for another pattern. Let's see what the outputs have in common compared to the inputs. Maybe the output has all instances of the number except the first occurrence removed. But in example1's second row, input has 6s at positions1,5,8,10,14. Output has 6s at positions1,10,14. So why are those 6s kept?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the first occurrence of the number (e.g., 8 in example0) is kept, and all subsequent occurrences in that row are replaced with 0, but if the first occurrence is the only one, it stays. But why in example1's second row, the output has multiple 6s?\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers in the input are not all the same. Let me check the examples. Looking at example1's input rows. For example, the first row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which has a 6. The output is the same. The next input row has multiple 6s. The output has three 6s. But according to the initial pattern of keeping the first occurrence, this doesn't fit. So perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is not about the first occurrence but about the number of occurrences. Or maybe the transformation is that in each row, all elements after the first non-zero element are set to zero. For example, the input row [0,6,0,0,0,6,0...] becomes [0,6,0,0,0,0,0...]. But in the output, the 6 at position1 is kept, and all others are set to zero. But in the given example, the output row has 6s at positions1,10,14. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the transformation is to set to zero all elements except the first occurrence of each distinct number in the row. But since all the non-zero elements in each row of the examples are the same (like all 8s in example0, all 6s in example1), that would mean only the first 8,6, etc., is kept. But example1's output contradicts that. Let me check example1's third input row.\n\nExample1's third input row is [0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. Output is [0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. So the input has 6s at positions2 and14. Output keeps both. But according to the 'first occurrence' rule, the first 6 at position2 would be kept, the others set to zero. But here, both are kept. So that's conflicting. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different pattern. Looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is to keep the first and last occurrence of each number in the row, and zero the rest. Let's test that. For example0's third input row: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0] \u2192 output [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So first 8 is at position4, last at position9. But output only keeps the first. So that's not matching. Another idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to remove every other occurrence of the non-zero number. Like, keep the first, remove the next, keep the next, etc. But example0's third input row has three 8s. Output has one. So that's not matching.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's look at the numbers. In example0, all non-zero entries are 8. The output rows have at most one 8. So maybe the rule is to collapse all 8s in a row to just the first one. But example0's fifth row input is [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, ...], which becomes [0,0,8,8,0, ...] in the output. Wait, no. Wait, example0's input fifth row is [0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and output is [0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, but according to the output in example0, that's the case. Wait, but in the example0 output given, the fifth row's output is [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. But according to the previous pattern of keeping only the first occurrence, this would not make sense. So there's a contradiction here. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong rows.\n\nWait, example0's fifth row in the input is [0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is the same. So this row has two 8s, both are kept. But according to the previous examples where only the first occurrence is kept, this is conflicting. Therefore, the pattern must be different.\n\nWait, what's the difference between the fifth input row and other rows in example0? Let's see. The fifth input row is [0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is [0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So both 8s are kept. Why?\n\nHmm, maybe the pattern is that consecutive duplicates are kept. For example, in the fifth row, the two 8s are adjacent. So maybe when the same number appears consecutively, they are kept, but non-consecutive duplicates are removed. Let's test this.\n\nIn example0's third input row: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0]. The 8s are at positions4,7,9 (assuming 0-based or 1-based indexing). They are not consecutive. The output keeps only the first 8. So that fits. But in the fifth row, the two 8s are consecutive (positions2 and3, assuming 0-based), so they are both kept. That would explain why in example0's fifth row, both 8s are present in the output.\n\nSimilarly, in example1's third row input: [0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. The two 6s are not consecutive. So in the output, they are both kept? Wait no. In example1's third input row, output is [0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. So the 6s at position2 and14 are kept, which are non-consecutive. But according to the hypothetical pattern, non-consecutive duplicates are removed. This contradicts.\n\nHmm. Let's try another angle. Looking at example0's fifth input row, the two 8s are adjacent. So perhaps the rule is to collapse runs of the same number into a single occurrence. But the output has two 8s. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to remove any non-zero element that is not part of a contiguous block starting from the first occurrence. For example, if the first occurrence is followed by more of the same number, those are kept. But any non-consecutive duplicates are removed. Let's test this.\n\nIn example0's fifth row, the two 8s are consecutive. So they are kept. If there's another 8 later in the row, it's removed. For example, if a row was [8,8,0,8], then the output would be [8,8,0,0]. Let's see example3's input and output. In example3's fifth input row: [0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4]. The output is [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. So the first 4 is at position2. Then there's a 4 at position4, which is not consecutive, so it's zeroed. Then positions7 and8 have 4s, which are consecutive. So in the output, those are kept. That fits. So the pattern could be:\n\nFor each row, starting from the first non-zero element, any subsequent occurrence of the same number is kept only if it is immediately following the previous occurrence. Otherwise, it is set to zero. So, contiguous blocks are allowed, but non-contiguous occurrences are removed.\n\nLet's test this with example0's third row. Input: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0]. The first 8 is at position4 (assuming 0-based), then the next is at position7 (not contiguous), so it's zeroed. The next at position9 is also not contiguous. So output only has the first 8. That fits.\n\nExample0's fifth row: [0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The first 8 is at position2, followed by another 8 at position3 (contiguous), so both are kept. Output is the same as input. That fits.\n\nIn example1's second row: input is [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. The first 6 is at position1. The next 6s are at positions5,8,10,14. None are contiguous to the first, so all are zeroed. But in the output, there are 6s at position1,10,14. Wait, that doesn't fit. So perhaps this is not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the contiguous block can start anywhere, not just from the first occurrence. But this seems complicated. Let's check another example.\n\nExample3's fifth input row: [0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4]. Output is [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. So the first 4 is at position2. Then a 4 at position4 (not contiguous), so zeroed. Then 4s at positions7 and8 (contiguous), so kept. So the rule would be: after the first occurrence, any contiguous block is kept. But this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to keep the first contiguous block of the number and remove all others. So in example0's fifth row, the contiguous 8s are kept. In example3's fifth row, the first contiguous block is [4] at position2, then another contiguous block at 7-8. But in the output, only the first block is kept. Wait, in example3's fifth row output, the 4s at 7-8 are kept. So this contradicts.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's look for another approach.\n\nMaybe the pattern is to retain the first occurrence of the number and any occurrence that is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to another occurrence. But that would require checking neighboring elements, which could complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers represent something like a wave, and the output is the first peak. But that's vague.\n\nAnother observation: in all training examples, the output rows have the same number of non-zero elements as the input rows, but in some cases, they have fewer. For example, example0's third row input has three 8s; output has one. So the pattern reduces the number of non-zero elements. But how?\n\nWait, looking at example0's first row: the input is [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], output is same. So if there's only one occurrence, it stays. If there are multiple, some are removed.\n\nLooking at example3's input row 0: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0]. Output is [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]. So the first 4 is kept, others removed.\n\nExample3's input row5: [0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4]. Output is [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. So the first 4 (position2) is kept. Then the next 4s at positions4,7,8. The 4s at7-8 are contiguous. But why are they kept? Maybe the rule is to keep the first occurrence and any consecutive occurrences after that, but not others.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is: in each row, after the first occurrence of the non-zero number, any subsequent consecutive occurrences are kept, but non-consecutive are removed. So if after the first occurrence, there's another occurrence next to it, it's kept; otherwise, removed.\n\nFor example, in example0's fifth row: input [0,0,8,8,0,...], the first 8 is at position2, then another at position3 (consecutive). So both are kept. The next 8s in the row are non-consecutive, so removed. In example3's row5 input, after the first 4 (position2), the next 4 is at position4 (not consecutive), so removed. Then at positions7 and8, which are consecutive to each other but not to any previous 4, they are kept. Wait, but why are they kept if they are not consecutive to the first occurrence?\n\nThis is tricky. Let's consider example3's row5 input again. Input: [0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4]. Output: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. So the first 4 is at index2. The next 4 is at index4 (not consecutive \u2192 removed). Then 4s at indices7 and8 (consecutive to each other but not to the first). According to the hypothetical rule, they would be kept. But why?\n\nMaybe the rule is that any group of consecutive non-zero elements is kept, but only the first occurrence of each group. For example, in example3's row5, there are three groups of 4s: at indices2 (single), 4 (single), 7-8 (group of two). The output keeps the first element of each group. But the output keeps the entire group. Wait, no, in the output, the 4s at indices7 and8 are kept. So the entire group is retained. But in the input, the groups are at 2,4,7-8. So the output keeps all groups, but for any group, only the first element is kept, and the rest are zeroed? No, because the output has both 4s at7-8.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that in each row, every contiguous block of the non-zero number is preserved, but isolated occurrences are kept only if they are the first. Wait, this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the transformation is to keep the first occurrence of the number and all occurrences that are part of a contiguous block starting from the first. For example, if the first occurrence is followed by more of the same number, they are kept. If there's a gap, subsequent occurrences are removed.\n\nIn example0's fifth row: the 8s are contiguous, so all are kept. In example0's third row: the first 8 is followed by zeros, so subsequent 8s are removed.\n\nIn example3's row5: the first 4 is at position2 (alone, not followed by another 4), then a single 4 at4 (removed), then a contiguous block at7-8 (so both are kept). But according to this, the 7-8 block should be removed because they are not contiguous to the first occurrence. But in the output, they are kept. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not based on contiguity.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the transformation is to remove all occurrences of the non-zero number except the first and last in each row. Let's test.\n\nExample0's third row input has three 8s. Output has only the first. So no.\n\nExample1's second row input has 6s at positions1,5,8,10,14. Output keeps 1,10,14. So first, fourth, fifth 6s. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's count the number of non-zero elements in input and output rows.\n\nExample0's third input row: 3 non-zero (8s). Output: 1.\n\nExample0's fifth input row: 2 non-zero. Output: 2.\n\nExample1's second input row: 5 non-zero. Output: 3.\n\nExample3's fifth input row: 4 non-zero. Output:3.\n\nSo the number of non-zero elements can increase or decrease. Not helpful.\n\nAnother observation: In all training examples, the non-zero numbers in each row are the same (e.g., all 8s in example0, all 6s in example1, etc.). So each row has a single non-zero number repeated. The output seems to keep certain instances of that number. Perhaps the rule is to keep the first occurrence and every other occurrence after that. Or maybe keep every nth occurrence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to keep the first occurrence and the last occurrence, but that doesn't fit example0's third row.\n\nAlternatively, the output removes any non-zero elements that are not the first or part of the first contiguous block. Let's see:\n\nIn example0's fifth row: the first contiguous block is two 8s. All are kept. In example3's row5: the first contiguous block is a single 4, then a block at7-8. So the output keeps the first block (single 4) and the next block (two 4s). But why? That's not clear.\n\nHmm. This is getting frustrating. Let me look for another angle. Let's compare input and output row by row for each example.\n\nLooking at example0:\n\nInput row 2: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0] \u2192 Output: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So only the first 8 is kept.\n\nInput row5: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0] \u2192 Output: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Only first 8 is kept.\n\nInput row6: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0] \u2192 Output: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Only first 8 kept.\n\nInput row8: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8] \u2192 Output: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Only first 8 kept.\n\nInput row9: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0] \u2192 Output: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]. Both 8s are kept. Because they are consecutive.\n\nSo here's the pattern: For each row, keep the first occurrence of the non-zero number and any subsequent consecutive occurrences, but remove any non-consecutive occurrences. So, in a row, after the first occurrence of the number, if the next occurrence is immediately after (consecutive), it's kept, but if there's a gap, subsequent occurrences are removed.\n\nLet's test this with example0's fifth input row: [0,0,8,8,0...]. The first 8 is at position2, next at position3 (consecutive). Both are kept. Then no more 8s. So output is same as input.\n\nExample0's ninth input row: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]. Output same as input. Both 8s are consecutive, so kept.\n\nExample3's fifth input row: [0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4]. Output: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. The first 4 is at position2. Next is at4 (not consecutive \u2192 removed). Then 4s at7 and8 (consecutive \u2192 kept).\n\nExample1's second input row: [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. Output: [0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. The first 6 is at position1. Next 6 at5 (not consecutive \u2192 removed). Then 8 is at position8 (not consecutive \u2192 removed). Then 6 at position10 (not consecutive \u2192 but in the output, it's kept. Hmm, this contradicts the pattern.\n\nWait, in the output of example1's second row, the 6s are at positions1,10,14. So, according to the pattern, after the first 6 at position1, there's a 6 at10 (not consecutive \u2192 should be removed), but it's kept. So this doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the pattern is different. Let's consider that in each row, the first occurrence and the last occurrence are kept, but this also doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to keep the first occurrence and any occurrence that is at an even index. Or something else based on position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to keep all occurrences of the non-zero number that are in even positions (assuming 0-based or 1-based). But checking example0's third input row (positions4,7,9). Output keeps position4. If 0-based, 4 is even (if 0 is even). 7 is odd, 9 is odd. So kept only even. But example0's fifth row has 8s at positions2 and3 (0-based), 2 is even, 3 odd. Output keeps both, which contradicts.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the transformation is to keep the first occurrence and any occurrence that is followed by a zero. Or another condition.\n\nAnother angle: The problem might involve looking at each element and checking if it's the first non-zero in its row. If yes, keep it; else, set to zero. This would fit example0's third row. But example0's fifth row has two 8s kept, which would not fit because only the first is kept.\n\nThis suggests that the initial hypothesis is incorrect, and I need to find another pattern.\n\nLooking back at the examples, perhaps the key is to consider that each row in the output has all instances of the non-zero number removed except for the first occurrence and any that are adjacent to the first occurrence. Let's test.\n\nExample0's fifth row: first 8 at position3 (if 1-based), next 8 is adjacent (position4) \u2192 kept. So output has both. Other 8s are not adjacent \u2192 removed.\n\nExample3's row5: first 4 at position3 (1-based), next 4 at position5 (non-adjacent) \u2192 removed. Then 4s at positions8 and9 (adjacent to each other but not to the first \u2192 kept? But why.\n\nNo, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: The transformation might involve some kind of run-length encoding. For example, each group of consecutive non-zero numbers is replaced with the first element of the group. So, in example0's fifth row, the two consecutive 8s become two 8s. But the output is the same. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, replace each group with a single instance. But example0's fifth row output has two 8s.\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Let's try to look for another way. Perhaps the output is the input with all but the first occurrence of the non-zero number in each row set to zero. But earlier examples don't fit this.\n\nWait, looking at example1's second row input: [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. Output: [0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. So the first 6 is kept. The 6s at positions10 and14 are also kept. Why? Are they the first occurrences of their own kind? But all are 6s. Maybe the pattern is different.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is to keep every alternate occurrence of the non-zero number. For example, keep the first, third, fifth, etc. But in example1's second row, there are 5 6s. Output keeps the first (position1), third (position8?), fifth (position14). But the output has 6s at positions1,10,14. Maybe positions1,5,8,10,14 are the input's 6s. The output keeps positions1,10,14. So 1st, 4th,5th. Not alternate.\n\nAlternatively, the output keeps the first occurrence and any occurrence that is a prime index. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In example1's second row output, the 6 at position10 (assuming 0-based index) is kept. Let's see: input row has 6s at indices1,5,8,10,14. Output has 6s at1,10,14. So maybe the pattern is to keep the first occurrence and any occurrence where the index is a multiple of 5 or something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to keep the first occurrence and any occurrence that is preceded by a zero. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet's try to find another pattern. Looking at example1's output row2: input has 6s at positions2 and14. Output keeps both. So perhaps if a row has multiple non-consecutive non-zero elements, they are all kept. But this doesn't fit other examples.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is not per row, but per column. But the examples show changes per row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to set to zero any non-zero element that is not the first in its column. But this would require looking at columns across all rows. However, in example0's output, the first column has an 8 in row1 and row2. So if it's per column, this would not fit.\n\nAnother idea: The transformation might involve the number of non-zero elements in each row. For example, if a row has more than two non-zero elements, reduce to one. But example0's fifth row has two and output has two. Example1's second row input has five, output has three. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the input with all non-zero elements except the first and last in each row. But example0's third row input has three 8s (positions4,7,9). Output has one. So no.\n\nThis is challenging. Let's try to look for any other possible pattern.\n\nLooking at example3's input row0: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0]. Output: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]. So the first 4 is kept, the second is removed. example3's input row5: [0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4]. Output: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. So first 4 kept, next removed, then two 4s kept. Why? If the rule is to keep the first occurrence and any occurrences that are part of a contiguous block later in the row. So after the first occurrence, if there's a contiguous block later, those are kept. Like, in example3's row5: after the first 4 at position2, there's a block at7-8. So those are kept. The 4 at position4 is isolated, so removed. That fits. So the rule could be:\n\nIn each row, keep the first occurrence of the non-zero number. Then, remove all subsequent isolated occurrences, but keep any contiguous blocks of the same number that occur later in the row.\n\nLet's test this with other examples.\n\nExample0's third row: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0]. First 8 at position4. Subsequent 8s are isolated. So all are removed. Output has only the first 8.\n\nExample0's fifth row: [0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. First 8 at position2, followed by another 8. This is a contiguous block, so both are kept.\n\nExample1's second row: [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. First 6 at position1. Subsequent 6s are at5 (isolated), 8 (isolated), 10 (isolated), 14 (isolated). So all are removed. But the output has 6s at positions1,10,14. This doesn't fit. So perhaps this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is to keep the first occurrence and any contiguous blocks, even if they are not contiguous to the first occurrence. So, in example3's row5, the two 4s at7-8 are kept as a block. In example0's fifth row, the two 8s are kept. In example1's second row, the 6s at positions1 (isolated),5 (isolated),8 (isolated),10 (isolated),14 (isolated). So according to this rule, only the first 6 should be kept. But the output has three 6s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the transformation is to keep the first occurrence of the number in each row and any occurrence that is part of a group where the number appears more than once in the row. For example, if a row has multiple instances of the number, but some are isolated, those are removed. But groups are kept. This is similar to the earlier idea but not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that each occurrence of the number is kept if it is the first in its row or if it is followed by another occurrence. For example, in example0's fifth row, the first 8 is kept, and the next is kept because it's followed by another 8. The third 8 is not followed by another, so removed. But in example0's fifth row, there are two 8s in input, both kept. So this works. In example3's row5, the first 4 is followed by a zero, so only the first is kept. But the output has two more 4s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me think about the test input and see if I can find a pattern there.\n\nThe test input uses the number 3. For each row, I need to determine which 3s to keep. For example, the first test input row is [0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3]. The output should keep the first 3 and possibly others. But according to the previous examples' patterns, if it's the first occurrence and consecutive, then maybe the first 3 is kept, and any consecutive 3s after that are also kept, but others are removed. But let's see.\n\nIf the rule is to keep the first occurrence and any consecutive occurrences after that, then in the first test row, the first 3 is at position1. The next 3s are at positions4,10,13. None are consecutive to the first. So output would be [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But according to the training examples, perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, if the rule is to keep the first occurrence and any 3s that are in even positions. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input with all non-zero elements except the first set to zero. So each row has at most one non-zero element. Let's check the training examples.\n\nExample0's fifth row input has two 8s, but output also has two. So this is not the case. So that's not the pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is to keep the first occurrence and the last occurrence of each row. Let's test:\n\nExample0's third row input has 8s at positions4,7,9. The output keeps only position4. So first occurrence. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample3's row5 input has 4s at positions2,4,7,8. Output keeps 2,7,8. Which would be first and last. But input's last 4 is at position8 (assuming 0-based). But output keeps both7 and8. So it's not the case.\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the pattern is different. Let's look at the examples again and see if there's a different angle.\n\nLooking at example0's output, the non-zero elements are mostly the first occurrence in each row. Except for row5 and row9. In row5, input is [0,0,8,8,0,...], output is same. So two 8s. In row9's input, [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0], output is same. So two 8s. So the pattern here is that if the non-zero elements are consecutive, they are kept; otherwise, only the first is kept.\n\nSo the rule could be: For each row, keep the first contiguous block of the non-zero number and remove all others. So, if the row has multiple contiguous blocks of the number, only the first block is kept. But in example3's row5, the first block is a single 4, then a later block of two 4s. The output keeps both blocks. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is to keep all contiguous blocks of the non-zero number. So, every contiguous block is kept, but isolated occurrences are removed except the first.\n\nWait, in example3's row5 input: [0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4]. The first 4 is isolated \u2192 kept. The next 4 is isolated \u2192 removed. The next two are a block \u2192 kept. So output would be [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4], which matches the example's output.\n\nExample0's third row input: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0]. The first 8 is isolated \u2192 kept. The next two are isolated \u2192 removed. So output is [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Which matches.\n\nExample0's fifth row input: [0,0,8,8,0,...] \u2192 contiguous block \u2192 kept. Output same.\n\nExample1's second row input: [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. The first 6 is isolated \u2192 kept. The next 6s are isolated \u2192 removed. So output should have only the first 6. But the example's output has 6s at positions1,10,14. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the pattern is not consistent across all examples. Perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the non-zero number in each row is the same. So the transformation is applied per row, considering that the number is the same. The pattern seems to be that in each row, only the first occurrence and any consecutive occurrences are kept. All others are set to zero. This would explain example0's rows, example3's rows, but not example1's second row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to keep the first occurrence and the first occurrence of any contiguous block. So, each contiguous block's first element is kept, and the rest are removed. But this also doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to keep only the first occurrence of the non-zero number and any occurrences that are part of a pair. For example, if there's a pair of consecutive numbers, both are kept. But in example0's fifth row, both are kept. In example1's second row, the 6 at position1 is kept, and the 6 at position10 is kept if it's part of a pair, but in the input, it's isolated. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Given the time constraints, maybe I should proceed with the hypothesis that the pattern is to keep the first occurrence of the non-zero number in each row and any consecutive occurrences after it, but remove any non-consecutive occurrences. Let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest input first row: [0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3]. The first 3 is at position1 (0-based). The next 3 is at position4 (not consecutive \u2192 removed). Then at position10 (not consecutive \u2192 removed), position13 (not consecutive \u2192 removed). So output would be [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nSecond row: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,3]. First 3 at position0. The next 3s are at positions7,8,9,10,13. The first contiguous block is position0 (single), then positions7-10 (consecutive). So the output would keep position0 and positions7-10. But according to the rule, after the first occurrence (position0), the next occurrences are at7 (not consecutive \u2192 removed). But wait, positions7,8,9,10 are consecutive. So this would be a contiguous block. But according to the rule, only the first contiguous block is kept. So the first 3 is at0 (single), then a block at7-10. So the output would keep position0 and positions7-10. But the output for this row would be [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0].\n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples?\n\nIn example1's second row, there's a row with multiple non-consecutive 6s. The output kept three of them. So perhaps the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to keep all contiguous blocks of the non-zero number. So, any group of consecutive numbers is kept. So in the test input's second row, the 3s at7-10 are kept, and the first 3 is kept. So the output would be [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,3]. But the last 3 at position13 is isolated \u2192 removed. So output would have 3s at0,7-10, and 13 removed.\n\nBut according to example3's row5, isolated blocks later are kept. So maybe the rule is to keep all contiguous blocks, regardless of their position.\n\nFor the test input's first row: [0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3]. The 3s are at positions1,4,10,13. All are isolated. So output would keep only the first 3 \u2192 [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nSecond row: 3s at0,7,8,9,10,13. The contiguous block is7-10. So keep 0,7-10. So output would be [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0].\n\nThird row: [3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 3s are at0 and6. Both isolated. Keep the first \u2192 [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nFourth row: [0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0]. 3s at2,4,9,10,11. Contiguous blocks are at2 (single),4 (single),9-11 (contiguous). So keep all blocks. So output would be [0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0].\n\nFifth row: [3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3]. 3s at0,2,10,13. All isolated. Keep only the first \u2192 [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut according to example3's row5, isolated blocks later in the row are kept. But in example3's row5, the isolated block at7-8 is kept. So in the fourth row of the test input, the block at9-11 is kept. The 3s at2 and4 are isolated, so kept as individual blocks. So output would have 3s at2,4,9-11.\n\nBut example3's fifth row had a single 4 kept at position2 and a block at7-8. So this suggests that all contiguous blocks are kept, regardless of position. So in each row, every contiguous block of the number is kept, and isolated occurrences are kept as individual blocks. But that would mean that in example0's third row, the first 8 is kept as a single block, and the other 8s are isolated and removed. But that's not the case.\n\nWait, example0's third row input: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0]. The first 8 is a single block. The other 8s are also single blocks. So according to this rule, all 8s would be kept. But in the output, only the first is kept. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the pattern is to keep only the first contiguous block of the number in each row. All other blocks are removed. So in example0's third row, only the first 8 is kept. In example0's fifth row, the first contiguous block (two 8s) is kept. In example3's row5, the first block (single 4) and the second block (two 4s) are kept. Wait, but according to this, example3's row5's output would have both blocks. But in the actual output, the 4 at position4 is removed. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent and the examples provided, perhaps the correct pattern is to keep the first occurrence of the non-zero number in each row and set all others to zero, regardless of their position. Even if they are consecutive. But example0's fifth and ninth rows contradict this. So there must be another pattern.\n\nWait, looking back at example0's input and output:\n\nInput row5: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0] \u2192 output [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So only the first 8 is kept.\n\nInput row9: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0] \u2192 output same as input. So both 8s are kept. But why? Because they are consecutive. So the pattern seems to be that if the non-zero elements are consecutive, keep them. Otherwise, keep only the first.\n\nSo the rule could be: For each row, keep the first occurrence of the non-zero number and any consecutive occurrences immediately following it. All other occurrences are set to zero.\n\nSo, in example0's fifth row: first 8 is at position3, next is at4 (consecutive), so both are kept. Any subsequent 8s are removed. In row9: first 8 at position5, next at6 (consecutive), both kept. \n\nIn example3's row5: first 4 at position2 (isolated \u2192 kept). Next 4 at4 (not consecutive \u2192 removed). Then 4s at7 and8 (consecutive \u2192 kept). So output has 4s at2,7,8.\n\nIn example1's second row: first 6 at position1 (isolated \u2192 kept). Next 6s at5,8,10,14 (all isolated \u2192 removed). But output has 6s at1,10,14. So this contradicts.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Given the time, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that the pattern is to keep the first occurrence of the non-zero number in each row and set all others to zero, except when they are consecutive to the first occurrence. Applying this to the test input.\n\nFor the test input's first row: [0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3]. First 3 at index1. Consecutive? No. So only the first is kept. Output: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nSecond row: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,3]. First 3 at0. Next 3s at7-10 (consecutive to each other but not to the first). So only the first is kept. Output: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nThird row: [3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. First 3 at0. Next 3 at6 (not consecutive). Output: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nFourth row: [0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0]. First 3 at2. Next 3 at4 (not consecutive \u2192 removed). Then 3s at9-11 (consecutive, but not to the first \u2192 removed). So output: [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nFifth row: [3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3]. First 3 at0. Next 3 at2 (not consecutive \u2192 removed). Others removed. Output: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nAnd so on for each row. \n\nBut based on example0's fifth row, consecutive 8s are kept. So in rows where the first occurrence is followed by consecutive same numbers, those are kept. So applying this to the test input's second row, which has consecutive 3s starting at7, but not consecutive to the first at0. So those are removed. Only the first 3 is kept.\n\nBut the example1's second row's output has multiple 6s, which doesn't fit. So this suggests that the pattern is not this.\n\nGiven that I'm running out of time, I'll proceed with the assumption that the pattern is to keep only the first occurrence of the non-zero number in each row and set all others to zero, regardless of their position. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nEach row in the test input has 3s. For each row, keep the first 3 and set others to zero.\n\nLet's process each test input row:\n\nRow 0: [0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3] \u2192 first 3 at index1 \u2192 output [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow1: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,3] \u2192 first 3 at0 \u2192 output [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow2: [3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 first 3 at0 \u2192 output [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0] \u2192 first 3 at2 \u2192 output [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow4: [3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3] \u2192 first 3 at0 \u2192 output [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 first 3 at5 \u2192 output [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow6: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0] \u2192 first 3 at0 \u2192 output [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 first 3 at4 \u2192 output [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0] \u2192 first 3 at10 \u2192 output [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nRow9: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3] \u2192 first 3 at1 \u2192 output [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0] \u2192 first 3 at4 \u2192 output [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow11: [0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 first 3 at3 \u2192 output [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow12: [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 first 3 at3 \u2192 output [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow13: [3,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0] \u2192 first 3 at0 \u2192 output [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow14: [3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0] \u2192 first 3 at0 \u2192 output [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow15: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 first 3 at0 \u2192 output [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow16: [0,0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3] \u2192 first 3 at2 \u2192 output [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut this approach doesn't account for example0's fifth and ninth rows where consecutive 8s are kept.

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's look at these examples. The task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists. Let's start by examining the first example, Example 0. \n\nLooking at the input and output rows, I notice that some of the 8s are removed. For instance, in the third row of Example 0's input, there are 8s at positions 4, 7, and 9. The output only has the 8 at position 4. Similarly, other rows in the output have fewer 8s. So maybe the rule is to remove some of the numbers based on certain criteria.\n\nHmm, what's common about the removed elements? Let's check another example. In Example 1, the input has a row [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,6,...]. The output for that row becomes [0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,...]. So the 6s in positions 5 and 8 are removed. Maybe the rule is to keep only the first occurrence of the number in each row and remove the others?\n\nWait, let's check another example. In Example 3's input, the first row is [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0]. The output becomes [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]. So the second 4 is removed. That fits the idea of keeping only the first occurrence. Let's verify another row.\n\nTake Example 2's input row [0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,0]. The output row is [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,0]. The first 5 is kept, the next two 5s in the same row are removed. Then there's a 5 later in the row that's kept. Wait, but that would contradict the first occurrence idea because the later 5s are still present. Hmm, maybe I need to look again.\n\nWait no, in the input row for Example 2, the first element is 0, then 5 (position 1), then 0s, then 5 at position 4, then another 5 at position 6. The output keeps the first 5 (position 1), and then the 5s at positions 13,15,16. Wait, that doesn't fit. So maybe the pattern isn't just keeping the first occurrence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to keep the leftmost occurrence of the number in each row and set the rest to zero. Let's check Example 0 again. The third input row has 8s at positions 4,7,9. Output keeps only position 4. So that's leftmost. Similarly, in Example 1's first input row, the 6s are at positions 1,5,8,10. Output keeps the first 6 (position1) and the one at position10 (but wait, in the output row, the 6 is at position11, which is the original 6 in position11 of the input? Wait the input for Example 1's first row is [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,6,0,...], but the output is [0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,...]. So the 6s at positions1,10 (original positions?) are kept. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with indices. Let me reindex.\n\nIn Example 1's input row (second row in Example 1's input):\n\nInput row is [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. So the 6s are at positions1,5,8,10,14. The output row is [0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. So positions1,10,14 are kept. Hmm, that's not leftmost. So maybe it's not leftmost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is processed such that for each unique number (other than zero), only the first occurrence (leftmost) is kept, and all others are set to zero. Let's test that.\n\nIn Example 1's input row (second row of input), the first 6 is at position1. The other 6s in positions5,8,10,14. So in output, those would be set to zero. But in the output, the 6 at position10 (original index10) is kept. Wait, that contradicts. So that can't be.\n\nWait maybe the rule is different. Let's check another example. Take Example 3's input. The first row is [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0]. The output is [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]. The first 4 is at position5 (assuming zero-based or one-based? Let's check carefully. Wait the lists are written as [0, 4, ...]. So in the first input row of Example3, the 4s are at index5 and 7 (if we count starting at 0). The output leaves index5 as 4, and index7 becomes 0. So that's first occurrence kept. Yes. Similarly, in the third row of Example3's input: [0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0] becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] in output. Wait, that's strange. The input has 4s at index1 and 6. The output removes both. So that's not just first occurrence. So maybe the rule isn't that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's that for each number (non-zero) in the row, you keep only the first occurrence of that number, but if the number appears again, you set it to zero. But in Example3's third input row, the 4s are in positions1 and 6 (0-based). So output has zeros there. But the output row is all zeros except for... Wait no, the third row's output in Example3 is all zeros. So that would mean that even the first occurrence is removed. That can't be. So perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nWait maybe the rule is to keep the first occurrence of each unique number in the entire row and set all others to zero, but the examples don't align with that. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is to remove all but the leftmost occurrence of the maximum number in the row. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's third input row: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0]. The maximum number is 8. The leftmost 8 is at index4. So in output, only that 8 remains. That's the case. Similarly, in Example1's second row input, the maximum is 6. The leftmost 6 is at index1. The output row has 6 at index1 and others zeroed, but in the output, there's a 6 at index10 (original) as well. Wait, that would not fit. So maybe that's not the rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to set to zero all instances of a number except the first and last occurrence in each row. Let's check Example0's third input row: 8s at positions4,7,9. First is 4, last is9. Output keeps 4. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compare input and output rows across all examples to find a common pattern. Looking at Example0's input and output:\n\nInput row 0: [0,8,0,...] \u2192 same in output. So first occurrence of 8 is kept, others in the row are zeros. But other rows have multiple 8s removed. So maybe the pattern is that for each row, all instances of a number (except maybe one) are set to zero, but how to decide which one.\n\nWait looking at Example0's row 5 input: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]. The output is [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 8 at index3 is kept, the one at index8 is removed. So leftmost 8 is kept. Similarly, in row 6 input: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0] \u2192 output [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So leftmost 8 is kept.\n\nBut in Example1's input row 1: [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. The output is [0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. Here, the leftmost 6 is at index1, but there's another 6 at index10 and 14. Wait, why are those kept?\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is different. Let me check Example1's output again. In the input row, the output keeps 6s at positions1, 10, 14. That's three 6s. So the leftmost is 1, but why are 10 and 14 kept? This contradicts the leftmost idea. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at another example. Example2's input row4 is [0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,0]. The output row is [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,0]. So the first 5 is at index1, kept. Then the next 5s at index4 and 6 are removed. But the 5s at index13,15,16 are kept. Wait, that's not leftmost. So this suggests that the leftmost occurrence isn't the only one kept. So maybe the rule is to keep the first occurrence of the number in each row and the last occurrence, but in Example0's third row, that would mean keeping positions4 and9, but the output only keeps 4. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to keep only the leftmost and rightmost occurrence. For example, in Example0's third input row, leftmost is4, rightmost is9. But output only has4. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to keep the first occurrence of each number in the row, and set all subsequent occurrences to zero. Let's test this. In Example0's third input row, the 8s are at positions4,7,9. The first occurrence is4, so others are set to zero. The output matches this. In Example1's second input row, the 6s are at positions1,5,8,10,14. The first occurrence is1, so others should be zero. But in the output, positions10 and14 still have 6. That's conflicting. So this can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the number in question is the maximum number in the entire input. For example, in Example0, all numbers are 8, so maximum is8. Then, for each row, only the first occurrence of the maximum is kept. But in Example1, the numbers are 6s. So per row, first occurrence of 6 is kept. Let's check Example1's input row1.\n\nOriginal input row: [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. The first 6 is at index1. So all other 6s should be zero. But the output row has 6s at index1,10,14. So that's three 6s. So this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to keep the leftmost and rightmost occurrence of the number in each row. For Example1's row1, if the 6s are at positions1,5,8,10,14 (indices starting at0?), then leftmost is1, rightmost is14. So output would keep those. But the output row in Example1 has 6s at positions1,10,14. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let's try another approach. Maybe the pattern is related to the number of non-zero elements. For example, in Example0's output, many rows have their non-zero elements reduced to 1 or 2. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's input row2: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0] \u2192 three 8s. Output row2: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 one 8. So perhaps each row is modified to have at most one occurrence of the number. But in Example3's output row10: [0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,4], the input was [0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,4]. The output has two 4s. So that contradicts the idea of one per row.\n\nWait, no. Let me check Example3's input row10: [0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,4]. The output row10 is [0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,4], same as input. Wait no, in Example3's input row10: The input is [0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,4], and the output is [0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,4]. So that's two 4s. So the pattern must allow multiple instances. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to remove all occurrences except those that are adjacent to another occurrence. For example, if two same numbers are next to each other, they stay. But in Example0's row4: [0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is the same. So two 8s are kept. But in row5 input: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0] becomes [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So only the first 8 is kept. So adjacent doesn't explain it.\n\nWait, in Example3's input row3: [0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0] \u2192 output is the same. So adjacent 4s are kept. But in Example0's row4, two 8s are adjacent and kept. So perhaps adjacent duplicates are kept, and non-adjacent ones are removed. But in Example3's input row5: [0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4] becomes [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. So the 4s at positions2 and4 (non-adjacent) are kept as 4 at position2 and zero at4. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a cellular automaton rule where cells with a number survive if they have a certain number of neighbors. But looking at the examples, it's unclear. For example, in Example0's row4: two 8s next to each other survive, but in row5, the lone 8 at position3 survives. So maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the sum of elements in each row. For example, in Example0's input row0: sum is 8. Output same. Input row2 sum is 8*3=24. Output sum is8. So maybe the rule is to keep the sum as the first occurrence. But why? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace all but the first occurrence of each number in the row with zero. Let's test this:\n\nIn Example0's input row2: 8s at positions4,7,9. Output keeps only the first (position4). So yes. Example1's input row1: 6s at positions1,5,8,10,14. Output keeps 1,10,14. Wait, that's three occurrences. So this can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is different. Maybe for each row, the non-zero elements are kept only if they are the first occurrence of that number in the entire matrix. But that would require global knowledge, and looking at the examples, it doesn't fit. For instance, in Example0's input, the first row has an 8. Subsequent rows also have 8s, but in the output, those are kept. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to retain the first occurrence of each number in each row and set others to zero, but in the case where the same number appears again after some zeros, maybe that's considered a new occurrence. But this doesn't explain Example1's row1.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers in the input are being treated as steps, and only the first step (leftmost occurrence) is kept. For example, in a row, after the first occurrence of a number, any subsequent occurrences are set to zero. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's input row2: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0]. Output keeps the first 8 (index4) and zeros others. Correct.\n\nExample1's input row1: [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. The first occurrence is6 at index1. All other 6s in the row would be set to zero. But the output has 6s at indices1,10,14. So that's three 6s. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm, maybe the numbers in the output are the same as in the input, but any number that is not the maximum in its row is set to zero. Wait, but in Example0's row0, the only non-zero is8. So max is8. Output same. In row4, two 8s are present (max), so kept. In Example1's row1, max is6, so all 6s should remain. But in the output, some 6s are removed. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to set to zero any number that is not the first occurrence of that number in the row. So for example, if a row has [3,0,3,3], the output would be [3,0,0,0]. But looking at Example3's input row5: [0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4], output is [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. So the first 4 is kept, the next one at position4 is zeroed, but the following ones at positions7 and8 are kept. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each number in a row, after the first occurrence, any subsequent occurrence that is not adjacent to the previous one is set to zero. For example, in row5 of Example3's input: the 4s are at positions2,4,7,8. Adjacency-wise: position2, then position4 is two steps away, so zero. Then position7 is three steps away from 4, zero. Position8 is adjacent to7, so kept. So output would be [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. Which matches the output. Let's check this hypothesis.\n\nTake Example1's input row1: [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]. The 6s are at positions1,5,8,10,14. The first 6 is at1. The next at5 (non-adjacent), so zero. Then 8 (non-adjacent to5), zero. 10 (non-adjacent to8), zero. 14 (non-adjacent to10), zero. So output should have only 6 at1. But the output has 6s at1,10,14. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to retain the first occurrence and any occurrence that is adjacent to another occurrence, but this is getting complicated. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nWait, looking at Example3's input row5: [0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4]. Output is [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. So the 4 at position4 is removed, but the 4s at7 and8 are kept. So perhaps when two 4s are adjacent (positions7 and8), they are kept. So the rule could be: for each number, keep the first occurrence, and any occurrence that is adjacent to another occurrence of the same number. Let's check this.\n\nIn Example0's row4: [0,0,8,8,0,...] \u2192 8s are adjacent, so both kept. Output same as input. Correct.\n\nExample0's row5: [0,0,0,8,0,...] \u2192 8 is alone, kept. The other 8 in the input is not adjacent, so removed. So output has one 8. Correct.\n\nExample1's input row1 has 6s at positions1,5,8,10,14. The first 6 at1 is kept. Then 5 is non-adjacent, removed. 8 is non-adjacent, removed. 10 is non-adjacent, removed. 14 is non-adjacent, removed. So output should have only 6 at1. But in the output, there are 6s at1,10,14. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach: let's look at the test input and see if we can find a pattern that applies to it based on the examples.\n\nThe test input has rows with 3s. For example, the first row is [0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3]. The output should follow the same pattern as the examples. Let's try to hypothesize.\n\nLooking at the examples, when there are multiple occurrences of a number in a row, many are turned into zeros except a few. For example, in Example0's row2, three 8s \u2192 one 8. In Example3's row5, four 4s \u2192 two 4s.\n\nWhat's common in the output for those rows? Let's see:\n\nIn Example3's row5 input: [0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4]. Output is [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. So the first 4 is kept, the second 4 is removed (non-adjacent), and the last two 4s (adjacent) are kept. So the rule could be: keep the first occurrence and any consecutive occurrences. So if a number is followed by the same number, keep them. Otherwise, remove.\n\nSo for a row, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the row.\n2. The first occurrence of the number is kept.\n3. Any subsequent occurrence is kept only if it is adjacent to the previous occurrence of the same number.\n4. All other occurrences are set to zero.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nTake Example0's row4: [0,0,8,8,0,...]. The first 8 is at index2. The next 8 is adjacent at index3. So both are kept. Correct.\n\nExample0's row5: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]. First 8 at3. The next 8 at8 is non-adjacent, so removed. Output has only 8 at3. Correct.\n\nExample3's row5 input: [0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4]. First 4 at2. Next 4 at4 (non-adjacent, removed). Then 4s at7 and8 (adjacent to each other but not to previous). Since the previous kept 4 is at2, the 4s at7 and8 are not adjacent to it, so they should be removed. Wait, but in the output, they are kept. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that for each group of consecutive same numbers, the first occurrence is kept, and the rest are kept if they are adjacent. So in the case of Example3's row5, the 4s at7 and8 are consecutive, so they are kept as a group. The first 4 at2 is kept as the first in its group. So the output would have two groups: one at2, another at7-8. So perhaps the rule is to keep each group's first occurrence, but allow adjacent ones.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to keep all consecutive occurrences of a number once the first in the group is kept. So if there's a group of consecutive same numbers, they are all kept. Non-consecutive groups are kept only the first occurrence.\n\nBut in Example3's row5 input, the 4s are not consecutive. So the first group is at2 (single 4), next at4 (single), then at7-8 (two). So according to this rule, the first occurrence of each group is kept. But the output has the 4s at2,7,8. So that would mean that for each group of consecutive same numbers, the first occurrence is kept. But in this case, the group at7-8 is consecutive, so both are kept. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to leave consecutive duplicates as is, but set any isolated occurrence (not part of a consecutive sequence) to zero, except the first occurrence. But that seems complicated.\n\nAnother idea: the output for each row in the examples seems to have only the first occurrence of the number and any occurrences that are part of the same contiguous block as the first. For example, in Example0's row4, the two 8s are kept as a block. If the first occurrence is part of a block, all in that block are kept. If there's another block later in the row, those are removed.\n\nBut Example3's row5 has two separate blocks of 4s (position2 and positions7-8). The output keeps both blocks. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, no. In the output of Example3's row5, the input is [0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4], and output is [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. So the first 4 (position2) is kept, but the next 4 at position4 is removed. Then the block at7-8 is kept. So perhaps the rule is to keep the first occurrence and any contiguous blocks that are adjacent to the first occurrence. No, because the blocks at7-8 are not adjacent to the first occurrence.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's look for differences between input and output in each example, and see if there's a common operation.\n\nExample0:\n\nIn row2, the 8s at positions7 and9 are removed. The output keeps only the first 8.\n\nIn row5, the 8 at position8 is removed.\n\nIn row6, the 8 at position6 is removed.\n\nExample1:\n\nIn row1, the 6s at positions5,8 are removed, but 10 and14 are kept. So why?\n\nExample3's row5: the 4 at position4 is removed, but those at7-8 are kept.\n\nAnother possibility: the rule is to set to zero any number that is not the first occurrence in the row or part of the last occurrence. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to keep the first and last occurrence of each number in the row. Let's check:\n\nExample0's row2: first 8 at4, last at9. Output keeps only4. So no.\n\nExample1's row1: first 8 at1, last at14. Output keeps1,10,14. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to keep the first occurrence and all occurrences that are adjacent to zero. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, looking at the numbers in the examples, each example uses a different number (8,6,5,4,3). So perhaps the number is irrelevant, and the pattern is based on the positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to remove any number that has another occurrence of the same number to its left in the same row. So for each element, if there is any same number to its left, set it to zero. This would mean that only the first occurrence is kept.\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample0's row2: the first 8 at4 is kept. Subsequent 8s at7 and9 are removed. Correct.\n\nExample1's row1: first 6 at1, others (5,8,10,14) are removed. But output has 6s at1,10,14. So contradicts.\n\nHmm, so this is not the pattern.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the numbers represent something like moves, and the output only includes the first and last moves. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to remove every other occurrence of the number. For example, keep the first, remove the second, keep the third, etc. But Example1's row1 has five 6s. Output has three, which is inconsistent.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look at the Test Input and see what the expected output might be, given the training examples.\n\nThe Test Input rows have 3s. Let's take the first row: [0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3]. If the pattern is to keep only the first occurrence of 3 in each row, the output would have 3 at index1 and the rest zeros. But in Example3's row5, the output kept two 4s. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait, in Example3's row5 input: [0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4]. Output is [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4]. So the first 4 is kept, the second is removed, and the last two are kept. This suggests that if there are consecutive occurrences, they are kept, but non-consecutive are removed.\n\nSo the rule could be: for each row, keep the first occurrence of a number and any consecutive occurrences after that. Non-consecutive occurrences are set to zero.\n\nSo, in a row, once you encounter a number, you keep it and any directly following occurrences, but any occurrence after a zero is considered a new occurrence and removed.\n\nFor example, in the Test Input's first row: [0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3].\n\nThe first 3 is at index1. The next 3 is at index4 (after zeros), so removed. Next at index10 (after zeros), removed. Next at index13, removed. So output would be [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut looking at Example3's row5 input: the first 4 is at index2, then index4 (non-consecutive, removed), then index7 (non-consecutive, kept). Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to keep the first occurrence and any occurrences that are part of a consecutive group. For example, if a number appears consecutively, keep all of them. Otherwise, set to zero.\n\nIn Example3's row5 input: the first 4 is at2 (single), then at4 (single, removed), then at7-8 (consecutive, kept). So output keeps 2,7,8. Which matches.\n\nIn Example1's row1 input: 6s at1 (single), 5 (single, removed), 8 (single, removed), 10 (single, removed), 14 (single, removed). But output has 6s at1,10,14. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is really tricky. Given the time I've spent and the examples, maybe the correct pattern is to keep only the first occurrence of each number in the row, and set all others to zero. Let's proceed with this hypothesis and see if it fits the test input.\n\nFor the Test Input's first row: [0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3]. The first 3 is at index1. All others are set to zero. So output row would be [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut looking at Example3's row5, the input has 4s at positions2,4,7,8. The output keeps 2,7,8. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to keep the first and last occurrence in each row. So for Example3's row5 input, first is2, last is8. But the output keeps2,7,8. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to keep the first occurrence and any occurrence that is at the end of the row. But again, not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the examples' outputs, in each case, the output rows have the non-zero elements in the same positions as the input, but with many of the non-zero elements removed. The key seems to be that in each row, only certain non-zero elements are kept. \n\nAnother observation: in Example0's output, the non-zero elements are all the first occurrence of 8 in their respective rows. In Example1's output, the non-zero elements are the first and sometimes other 6s, like in row1, the output has 6s at positions1,10,14. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the numbers in the output are the same as in the input, but any non-zero number that is not part of a pair is removed. For example, if a number appears once in a row, it's kept, but if it appears multiple times, only pairs are kept. But this doesn't fit Example0's row4, which has two 8s and they are kept.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to keep only even occurrences of a number. But Example0's row4 has two 8s (even) and they are kept. Example1's row1 has five 6s. Output has three, which is odd. So no.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to shift all non-zero elements to the left, filling the rest with zeros. But looking at the examples, that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to remove all non-zero elements except those that are at positions where the same number appears in the column below. But that seems complicated.\n\nAfter much deliberation, I think the most plausible pattern is that in each row, only the first occurrence of the number is kept, and all others are set to zero. This fits Example0 and Example3's outputs, but doesn't fit Example1 and Example2.\n\nBut since there's inconsistency in the examples, perhaps the pattern is that each row has all occurrences of the number except the first one set to zero. Even if some examples seem to contradict this, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number in each row is replaced with zero except for the leftmost and rightmost occurrence. But how to determine which to keep.\n\nWait, in Example3's row5 input: [0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4]. The leftmost is2, rightmost is8. Output keeps2,7,8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Given the time I've invested and the need to proceed, I'll assume the pattern is to keep the first occurrence of each number in the row and set others to zero, even though some examples seem to contradict. Perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nEach row will have only the first occurrence of 3 (or other numbers) kept, others set to zero.\n\nLooking at the first row of the test input: [0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3]. The first 3 is at index1. The others (4,10,13) are set to zero. So output row would be [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nLet's check another row in the test input. For example, the second row: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,3]. The first 3 is at index0. All other 3s are set to zero. So output row would be [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nThird row: [3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. First 3 at0, next at6. Output would be [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nFourth row: [0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0]. First 3 at index2. Others set to zero. Output [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, this doesn't explain why some outputs have multiple numbers. For example, in Example1's row1, the output has multiple 6s. So this hypothesis must be wrong.\n\nAnother possibility: the transformation is to keep the first two occurrences of the number in each row. In Example1's row1 input, there are five 6s. The output has three. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are kept if they are in even positions. But that's not the case.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the pressure, I think the correct pattern is to keep the first occurrence and any consecutive occurrences. So in each row, after the first occurrence, only consecutive duplicates are kept. Non-consecutive are removed.\n\nApplying this to the test input's first row:\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3]. The first 3 is at index1. The next 3 is at index4 (non-consecutive, set to zero). Then at index10 (non-consecutive, zero). At index13 (non-consecutive, zero). So output row is [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nAnother row in test input: the fourth row [3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3]. First 3 at0. Next 3 at2 (non-consecutive, zero). Then at10 (non-consecutive, zero). At13 (non-consecutive, zero). Output [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nAnother row: the last row of test input [0,0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3]. First 3 at2. Next at3 (consecutive, kept). Then at6 (non-consecutive, zero). Then at12 and13 (non-consecutive, zero). So output would be [0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this seems to fit better. For Example3's row5 input: [0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4]. First 4 at2, then 4 at4 (non-consecutive, zero), then 4 at7 (non-consecutive, zero), but then 4 at8 (consecutive to7). Wait, 7 and8 are consecutive. So after the first 4 at2, the 4 at7 is non-consecutive, but the 4 at8 is consecutive to7. So according to the rule, the first 4 at2 is kept. The 4 at7 is kept if it's consecutive to previous (but previous is zero). So the 4 at7 is the start of a new group, so it's kept. Then 4 at8 is consecutive to7, so kept. So output would have 4s at2,7,8. Which matches Example3's output.\n\nAh, this makes sense. The rule is: for each row, split into groups of consecutive identical numbers. For each group, keep the first occurrence of the number in that group. All other occurrences in the same group are kept. So, each group of consecutive numbers is preserved, but any subsequent groups of the same number are removed.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify: Each group of consecutive non-zero numbers is considered. For each such group, keep the first occurrence of the number in the group, and set the rest to zero. Or perhaps, keep all consecutive occurrences as long as they are part of the same group.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to keep the first occurrence of each number in the row and any consecutive duplicates that follow it. Subsequent occurrences, even if in a group, are removed unless they are part of the first group.\n\nNo, that doesn't fit Example3's row5. Let me think again.\n\nThe correct pattern seems to be that in each row, any group of consecutive identical numbers is preserved, but isolated occurrences (not part of a consecutive group) are removed except for the first occurrence. Or perhaps, each group of consecutive numbers is kept only once.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to remove all non-zero numbers except those that are part of a consecutive pair or more. For example, single non-zero elements are removed, but if there are two or more in a row, they are kept. But in Example0's row0: [0,8,0,...], the 8 is single but kept. So this can't be.\n\nAfter much consideration, the only pattern that seems to fit all examples is that in each row, the first occurrence of each number is kept, and all subsequent occurrences are removed. This works for Example0, Example3, but not Example1 and Example2. However, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis of Example1 and Example2.\n\nLooking back at Example1's row1 input:\n\nInput: [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0]\n\nSo the first 6 is at index1. Then, there are 6s at5,8,10,14. The output keeps 6s at1,10,14. This suggests that the pattern is not just first occurrence. Maybe the rule is to keep every other occurrence. But first kept, second removed, third kept, fourth removed, etc. So for this row, the kept indices would be1,8,14. But output has1,10,14. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to keep the first occurrence and any occurrence that is after a certain number of steps. Not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the pattern is to keep the first occurrence of each number in the row and set all others to zero. Applying this to the test input.",
