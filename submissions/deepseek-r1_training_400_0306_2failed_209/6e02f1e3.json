        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output ones. Let's look at the training examples and see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[2,2,2]\n[3,2,3]\n[3,3,3]\nOutput:\n[5,0,0]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,0,5]\n\nHmm. The output has 5s in positions where maybe the rows are all the same. Let me check. The first input row is all 2s, and the output's first row is [5,0,0]. The second input row isn't all the same (3,2,3), but the output's second row has a 5 in the middle. Wait, maybe it's looking for rows that are all the same in the input. But the second row of input in Example 0 isn't all same. So that's probably not it.\n\nWait, maybe each row in the output corresponds to a row in the input that is all the same. For example 0, the first and third input rows are all same. But the output rows have 5s in each position. Wait, the output in example0 has three rows, each with a 5 in different positions. Maybe there's a diagonal involved. Like the first output row has 5 in the first position, second in the second, third in the third. So perhaps each 5 in the diagonal represents a row in the input that is all the same. Let me check.\n\nIn Example0, the first input row is all 2s, so output's first row starts with 5. The third input row is all 3s, so output's third row ends with 5. The second input row is [3,2,3], which isn't all same. But the output's second row is [0,5,0]. Wait, maybe the output is indicating the count of how many times a particular number appears in each column? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 5 in the position where the corresponding row in the input is the maximum for that column. Let's check Example0's input:\n\nFirst input row: [2,2,2]\nSecond: [3,2,3]\nThird: [3,3,3]\n\nLooking at each column:\n\nColumn 0: 2,3,3. Max is 3. So in column 0, rows 2 and 3 have max. But output's first element is 5. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 5 for each position where the input element is the maximum in its column. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0:\n\nFirst column is 2,3,3. Max is 3. So rows 2 and 3. But output's first row has 5 in first position. That doesn't align.\n\nWait, maybe the output is about rows that have all elements equal to the maximum value of their row. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's first row: all 2s. The max is 2. So if another row has elements equal to the max of this row? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: the output seems to have 5s in certain positions and 0s elsewhere. Let's look at the positions where 5s are present. For example, in Example0, the 5s are in the diagonal. So row 0, column 0; row1, column1; row2, column2. The output has 5s on the diagonal. But why?\n\nLooking at the input matrices for examples where the output is a diagonal of 5s. Example0's input has three rows. First and third are all same, the second isn't. The output is a diagonal. Maybe each diagonal 5 represents a row that is all the same, and their positions correspond to their position in the input. Wait, the first input row is all same (2s), so in the output, the first row has 5 in the first position. The third input row is all 3s, so the output's third row has 5 in third position. What about the second row in Example0's input is [3,2,3]. The output's second row has 5 in the middle. Maybe the 5 is in the column where that row's element is the maximum of the column. Let's check:\n\nFor Example0, input's second row is [3,2,3]. Let's look at each column:\n\nColumn0: 2,3,3 \u2192 max is 3. The second row's column0 is 3 (part of the max). So in output's row1, column0 would be 5 if that's the case. But the output for row1 is [0,5,0]. So column1. The second row's column1 is 2. That's not the max of column1, which is 2 (from first row) and 3 (third row). Wait, column1 in input is 2,2,3. Max is 3. So the third row's column1 is the max. So why is there a 5 in row1, column1?\n\nHmm, maybe this isn't the right approach. Let's look at Example1.\n\nExample1 input:\n\n[3,3,3]\n[4,2,2]\n[4,4,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,0]\n\nThe output here has 5s in the third position of first row, second position of second, first of third. Let's see the input rows:\n\nFirst row is all 3s. Output first row has 5 in third column. Hmm, not sure. Second input row is [4,2,2]. Output's second row has 5 in column1. Third input row is [4,4,2]. Output's third row has 5 in column0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row's 5 is placed in the column where that input row's element is the maximum in its column.\n\nWait, let's check for Example1's input:\n\nFirst row: [3,3,3]. Let's look at each element's column.\n\nColumn0: 3,4,4 \u2192 max is 4. So 3 is not max. Column1:3,2,4 \u2192 max is4. Column2:3,2,2 \u2192 max is3. So for the first row, the third column (3) is the max in its column (since column2's max is3). So in the first row, third element is max in its column. So output row0, column2 is 5. That's what the output shows.\n\nSecond input row: [4,2,2]. Column0: max is4 (this row's element is4). Column1:2 vs 3 (row0) and 4 (row2). Max in column1 is4. So this row's column1 element is2, which is not max. Column2:2 vs 3 and2. Max is3. So the elements in the second row are 4,2,2. The column0's max is4 (so this element is max), column1's max is4 (so 2 is not), column2's max is3 (so 2 is not). So the second row's element in column0 is a max. So why does the output have a 5 in column1 for row1? Hmm, maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row's 5 is in the column where the input row's element is the unique maximum in that column. Let's see:\n\nIn Example1:\n\nThird row is [4,4,2]. Column0: 3,4,4 \u2192 max is4 (appears in rows1 and2). So not unique. Column1:3,2,4 \u2192 max is4 (row2). So unique. Column2:3,2,2 \u2192 max is3 (row0). So for row2 (third input row), column0's element is4, which is max but not unique. Column1's element is4, which is unique. So output for row2 would have 5 in column1. But the output for row2 is [5,0,0]. Which is column0. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis approach doesn't seem to hold. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at Example2:\n\nInput all rows are [4,4,4]. Output is [5,5,5] in first row, others are 0s. So when all input rows are same, the output's first row has all 5s, others 0. Similarly, Example3's input is all [3,3,3], output is same as Example2. So in cases where all rows are identical, the first output row is all 5s, others 0. So perhaps the output rows are determined by which rows in the input are all the same. Then, the 5s are arranged in the output rows based on some ordering.\n\nWait, but in Example0, the output's first and third rows have 5s. Wait, no. Example0's output is:\n\n[5,0,0]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,0,5]\n\nWhich implies all three rows have a 5. But the input has first and third rows as all same. So why three 5s in diagonal? Hmm. Maybe when there are multiple rows with all elements same, they are ordered, and each 5 is placed in their respective position. Like, for each row that is all same, the output's corresponding row has a 5 in the position equal to their index. Wait, in Example0, the first and third input rows are all same. But output's first row has 5 in position0, third row in position2. Second row has 5 in position1. But the second input row isn't all same. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the 5s in the output indicate the presence of the same number in all rows for that column. For example, if a column has all elements the same, then in the output's first row, that column is 5. But looking at Example0's input columns:\n\nColumn0: 2,3,3 \u2192 not all same. Column1:2,2,3 \u2192 not all same. Column2:2,3,3 \u2192 not. So this can't be.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the outputs. Each output row has exactly one 5, and the rest 0s, except for Examples2 and3 where the first output row has all 5s. So maybe the 5s are indicating something about the position where a certain condition is met.\n\nIn Examples2 and3, all input rows are the same. So output's first row is all 5s. Then, perhaps in cases where multiple rows are the same, the first occurrence gets priority, and the rest are zeroed out. But in Example0, there are two rows (first and third) that are all same, but the output has three rows with diagonal 5s. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a diagonal matrix where the diagonal entries are 5 if the corresponding input row has all elements equal to the maximum value in the entire input matrix. Let's check.\n\nExample0's input matrix has elements up to 3. The maximum is 3. The third row is [3,3,3], so all elements are max. The first row is [2,2,2], not max. So the output's third row would have 5s. But the output for Example0 has 5s in all diagonal positions. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps each diagonal entry in the output is 5 if the corresponding row in the input is a permutation of the row with the maximum sum. Let's compute row sums.\n\nExample0's input rows:\nRow0: 2+2+2=6\nRow1:3+2+3=8\nRow2:3+3+3=9. So max sum is9. Row2 has sum9. Output for row2 is [0,0,5]. So the 5 is in the third position. Maybe the 5 is placed in the column corresponding to the row's index. So row2 would have 5 in column2. That matches. But row0 and row1 in output have 5s as well, even though their sums are lower. So maybe not.\n\nHmm. Let's think of another angle. Looking at the outputs, in examples where all input rows are the same (Examples2,3), the output's first row is all 5s, and the rest are zeros. So maybe the first row in the output represents that all rows are the same. Then, when there are multiple unique rows that are all same, the output's rows correspond to their positions. Wait, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output 5s are indicating the number of times a row is the maximum in its column. For instance, each column in the input is considered, and the row(s) that have the maximum value in that column get a 5 in the corresponding position. Then, the output rows accumulate these 5s. But how?\n\nTake Example0:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0: 2,3,3 \u2192 max is3 in rows1 and2. So for column0, rows1 and2 would contribute a 5 in their row's column0.\n\nColumn1:2,2,3 \u2192 max is3 in row2.\n\nColumn2:2,3,3 \u2192 max is3 in rows1 and2.\n\nSo row0 has no max in any column. Row1 has max in column0 and column2. So row1's output would have 5s in column0 and column2? But the output for row1 is [0,5,0]. That doesn't fit. So this approach isn't working.\n\nWait, perhaps the output matrix is a 5 in each position where the input's element in that position is the maximum in its row. Let's check.\n\nExample0 input rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]. All elements are same. So all are max. So output row0 would have 5s in all positions, but the actual output is [5,0,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nExample1 input:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]. All max, so output row0 would be all 5s. But actual output is [0,0,5]. So no.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is determined by comparing each row to the others. For example, each row in the output has a 5 in the position where that row's element is higher than the corresponding element in the other rows. Let's see.\n\nExample0's rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nComparing row0 to row1: For each element, if row0's element is higher than row1's. But 2 vs3 \u2192 no. 2 vs2 \u2192 same. 2 vs3 \u2192 no. So row0 doesn't have any elements higher than row1. Comparing row0 to row2: all elements are lower. So perhaps that's not it.\n\nAnother thought: The output is a diagonal matrix where each diagonal element is 5 if the corresponding input row is the only one with that particular maximum value in some column. For example, in Example0:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0: max 3 (rows1 and2)\n\nColumn1: max 3 (row2)\n\nColumn2: max3 (rows1 and2)\n\nSo for column1, row2 is the only max. So perhaps in the output, row2's column1 would have a5. But output for row2 is [0,0,5]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a permutation matrix where the 5s indicate the position of the maximum element in each row. Let's check.\n\nExample0's input rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]. Max is2. So all positions. But output row0 is [5,0,0]. So maybe the first occurrence? Not sure.\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]. Max is3, positions0 and2. Output is [0,5,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's look at another example. Example4:\n\nInput:\n\n[4,4,4]\n[4,4,4]\n[3,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[5,0,0]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,0,5]\n\nSo the output is diagonal 5s. Input has first two rows all 4s, third all3s. So how does this fit?\n\nIf the output is diagonal, maybe each diagonal entry corresponds to a row that is \"unique\" in some way. The first two input rows are same, third is different. The output has 5s on all three rows. That's puzzling.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is constructed by looking for each row in the input, and if that row is all the same number, then place a 5 in the output's row in the column corresponding to the index of that number in a sorted list of unique values. Or maybe based on the order of their occurrence.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input rows as being sorted, and the 5s indicate their position in this sorted order. For example, in Example4, the input has two rows of 4s and one of3s. If we sort the rows in ascending order, the third row (3s) comes first, then the first two rows (4s). Then the output diagonal 5s may indicate the original positions after sorting. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output represents which rows are duplicates. For example, in Example4, the first two rows are duplicates, so the output may mark one of them. But the output has 5s in diagonal. Not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the 5s in the output are arranged such that each 5 in position (i,j) indicates that the j-th row in the input is the first occurrence of a unique row, and the 5 is placed in column i. For example, in Example4, the first two rows are duplicates, so the first occurrence is row0, and the third row is unique. So output's row0 would have 5 in column0 (indicating first unique row), row1 would have 5 in column1 (since row1 is a duplicate of row0, maybe not), row2 has 5 in column2. Not sure.\n\nLet's try another approach. Let's consider the sum of each input row and see how it relates to the output.\n\nExample0 input rows:\n\nRow0: sum6, row1:8, row2:9. Output row2 has 5 in third position. But row2 has the highest sum. Example0's output is diagonal, but not sure.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0 sum9, row1 sum8, row2 sum10. So row2 has highest sum. Output for row2 is [5,0,0], which is first position. So maybe the highest sum row gets 5 in the first position. But in Example0, the highest sum is row2, which in output has 5 in third position. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is based on the positions where the row's elements are equal to the mode of their respective columns. Let's check.\n\nExample0's columns:\n\nColumn0: 2,3,3 \u2192 mode 3.\n\nColumn1:2,2,3 \u2192 mode 2.\n\nColumn2:2,3,3 \u2192 mode3.\n\nSo output rows would have 5 where the element equals the column's mode.\n\nRow0: [2,2,2] \u2192 column0 is2, not mode (3). So no. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is a permutation of the input rows where each row is moved to a new position based on some criteria. For example, in Example0, input rows are [2,2,2], [3,2,3], [3,3,3]. The output has 5s on the diagonal. Maybe the 5s are indicating that each row is shifted to a position where their first occurrence of a unique value is placed. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example4's output:\n\nInput rows are [4,4,4], [4,4,4], [3,3,3]. Output is diagonal 5s. So each row in the output has a single 5, but the first two input rows are the same. How does that fit?\n\nAnother idea: Each output row corresponds to a unique input row, and the 5 is placed in the column corresponding to the order of uniqueness. For example, the first unique row gets 5 in column0, the next in column1, etc. But in Example4, the first two rows are the same, so they would count as one unique row, and the third as another. But the output has three rows with 5s. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a diagonal matrix where each diagonal entry is 5 if the corresponding input row is a \"distinct\" row, and the order is determined by their first occurrence. In Example4, the first two rows are same, so they are not distinct. Only the third is distinct. But the output has three 5s. So this is not it.\n\nPerhaps I need to look for another pattern. Let's consider the number of 5s in the output and how they relate to the input.\n\nIn Examples0,1,4, the outputs have three 5s (one per row), arranged in diagonal or other positions. In Examples2,3, the output's first row has three 5s, others 0.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: if all input rows are the same, then the first output row has all 5s. Otherwise, each row in the output has a 5 in a certain position based on some criteria.\n\nIn Example0, input has three rows, two of which are all same (row0 and row2). But the output has diagonal 5s. So perhaps when there are multiple rows that are all same, they are each assigned a 5 in their own diagonal position, and other rows are also assigned based on some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a diagonal matrix where each diagonal element is 5 if the corresponding input row is a permutation of the maximum values in each column. Let's check:\n\nFor Example0:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0: max is3 (rows1 and2)\n\nColumn1: max is3 (row2)\n\nColumn2: max is3 (rows1 and2)\n\nSo the maximum for each column is 3. The row that has max in all columns is row2. So output for row2 would have 5s in all positions, but it's [0,0,5]. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, each output row's 5 is in the position where that row's element is the maximum in its column. But considering only the first occurrence of the maximum.\n\nFor example, in Example0's column0, the max is3 (rows1 and2). The first occurrence is row1, so output row1 has 5 in column0. Column1's max is3 in row2, so output row2 has 5 in column1. Column2's max is3 in row1 and row2; first occurrence is row1. So output row1 has 5 in column2. But the output for row1 is [0,5,0], which is column1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find another pattern. Maybe the output rows are generated by checking if the input row is a permutation of the first row. For example, in Example0's input, the first row is [2,2,2], second row is [3,2,3], third is [3,3,3]. None of these are permutations of each other. So output is diagonal.\n\nIn Example4, first two rows are same, third is different. Output is diagonal. So maybe when a row is unique, the 5 is in the diagonal. When there are duplicate rows, the first one has 5 in diagonal, others have 0s. But in Example4, the first two rows are duplicates, but the output has 5s in their respective rows. So that's not it.\n\nWait, looking at Example4's output:\n\n[5,0,0]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,0,5]\n\nSo each row has a 5 in their own column. Even though the first two input rows are duplicates. So why are both getting 5s in their own positions? Perhaps the output is diagonal when the input rows are not all same. And when they are all same, the first row is all 5s.\n\nExamples2 and3 have all rows same, output's first row is all 5s. Others are 0. So the pattern could be:\n\nIf all input rows are the same, output's first row is all 5s, others 0.\n\nOtherwise, for each row in the input, if that row is unique (not duplicated), output has a 5 in the diagonal position. If there are duplicate rows, then their 5s are placed in the diagonal based on their order of appearance. Or maybe regardless of duplicates, each row gets a 5 in the diagonal position.\n\nBut in Example4, first two rows are duplicates. Output's first row has 5 in column0, second in column1, third in column2. So each row in the output has a 5 in their own column, regardless of duplicates. Then in Examples0 and1, even if there are duplicates, each row gets a 5 in their own column. But how does that fit with the output structure?\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a diagonal matrix where each diagonal entry is 5 if the corresponding input row is not all the same as any other row. But in Example4, the first two rows are same, so they would have 0s. But the output has 5s. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is always a diagonal matrix with 5s, except when all rows are same. Then the first row has all 5s.\n\nThat would explain Examples0,1,4 having diagonal 5s, and Examples2,3 having first row all 5s. But why?\n\nBut looking at Example0's input, which has some rows not the same, the output is diagonal. Example2's input has all rows same, so output first row is all 5s. So this seems to be a pattern.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\nIf all rows in the input are the same, the output's first row is [5,5,5], and the other rows are [0,0,0]. Otherwise, each row in the output has a 5 in the diagonal position (i,i) and 0 elsewhere.\n\nBut wait, in Example4, the input has first two rows same, third different. According to this rule, since not all rows are same, output should be diagonal. Which it is. So yes.\n\nExample1's input has all rows different, so output is diagonal. Which it is, but the diagonal is [0,0,5], [0,5,0], [5,0,0]. Wait, no. Wait the output of Example1 is:\n\n[0,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,0]\n\nWhich is not a diagonal matrix. The diagonal positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) are 0,5,0. So this contradicts the previous idea.\n\nSo that's not the case. Hmm.\n\nSo perhaps there's another layer here. Let's look at the positions of the 5s in the outputs when the input rows are not all same.\n\nExample0's output is diagonal 5s.\n\nExample1's output is reverse diagonal (5s in (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)).\n\nExample4's output is diagonal.\n\nSo why the difference between Example0 and Example1?\n\nLooking at the inputs:\n\nExample0 input:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[3,2,3]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nRows 0 and 2 are all same. Row1 is not.\n\nExample1 input:\n\n[3,3,3]\n\n[4,2,2]\n\n[4,4,2]\n\nAll rows are different.\n\nExample4 input:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nRows0 and1 are same. Row2 is different.\n\nOutputs:\n\nExample0: diagonal 5s.\n\nExample1: 5s at (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).\n\nExample4: diagonal 5s.\n\nSo what's the difference between Example0 and Example1?\n\nIn Example0, two rows are all same. In Example1, all rows are different. In Example4, two rows are same.\n\nSo maybe the arrangement of 5s depends on the order of unique rows. For example, when there are multiple unique rows, the 5s are arranged in the diagonal in the order of the rows. But in Example1, why is the output not diagonal?\n\nLooking at Example1's output:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\nThis looks like a reversed diagonal. So the 5s are in positions (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). Maybe this depends on the values of the rows.\n\nExample1's input rows:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [4,2,2]\n\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nSo maybe the rows are sorted in some way, and the 5s are placed based on their sorted order.\n\nIf we sort the rows in descending order, row1 and row2 have higher values than row0. Let's see:\n\nRow1: [4,2,2] sum is8\n\nRow2: [4,4,2] sum is10\n\nRow0: [3,3,3] sum9\n\nSo sorted descending by sum: row2 (10), row0 (9), row1 (8).\n\nThen the output's 5s would be in the positions corresponding to their sorted order. For example, the highest sum row (row2) gets 5 in column0, next in column1 (row0), then row1 in column2. But the output for Example1 is:\n\n[0,0,5] \u2192 row0:5 in column2\n\n[0,5,0] \u2192 row1:5 in column1\n\n[5,0,0] \u2192 row2:5 in column0\n\nWhich matches this sorted order. Row2 (highest sum) is first in sorted list, so 5 in column0. Row0 (next) is in column1. Row1 in column2.\n\nSo the output positions are based on the sorted order of the rows, where the highest row gets 5 in column0, next in column1, etc. But how are the rows sorted?\n\nIn Example0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: sum6\n\nRow1: sum8\n\nRow2: sum9\n\nSorted descending: row2, row1, row0.\n\nThen output should have row2's 5 in column0, row1 in column1, row0 in column2. But the output for Example0 is diagonal:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\nWhich corresponds to row0 in column0, row1 in column1, row2 in column2. So this contradicts the sorted order idea.\n\nBut in Example1, the sorted order of sums was row2 (10), row0 (9), row1 (8), and the output 5s are in columns0,1,2 for those rows. So the output's 5s are placed based on the sorted order. Example0's rows are sorted as row2, row1, row0, but output has 5s in columns0,1,2 for rows0,1,2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the sorting is based on the rows' maximum element.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0's max is2, row1's max is3, row2's max is3. So sorted by max descending: row1 and row2 (max3), then row0 (max2). But how to order row1 and row2. If tiebreaker is the row sum: row1 sum8, row2 sum9. So sorted row2, row1, row0.\n\nBut output 5s are in their original positions. So this approach isn't aligning.\n\nAnother idea: The output's 5s are arranged in the order of the rows' first occurrence of being unique. For example, in Example1, all rows are unique, so the first row's 5 is in column0, second in column1, third in column2. But the output is [0,0,5], [0,5,0], [5,0,0]. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output's 5s are arranged based on the rows' own values in a certain order. For Example1:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [4,2,2]\n\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nIf we sort the rows in lexicographical order:\n\nRow0:3,3,3\n\nRow1:4,2,2\n\nRow2:4,4,2\n\nSorted lexicographically: row0, row1, row2.\n\nBut output 5s are in columns2,1,0. So that's reverse order. So maybe the 5s are placed in reverse order of the sorted rows. So row2 (highest) gets column0, row1 column1, row0 column2. Which matches the output of Example1.\n\nIf that's the case, then the output's 5s are placed in the column corresponding to the reverse order of the sorted rows.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRows sorted lex order:\n\nRow0:2,2,2\n\nRow1:3,2,3\n\nRow2:3,3,3\n\nSorted order: row0, row1, row2.\n\nReverse order: row2, row1, row0.\n\nSo the 5s would be placed in columns0,1,2 for rows2, row1, row0. But the output's 5s are in columns0,1,2 for rows0,1,2. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This is getting too complicated. Let's try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nAlternative approach: For each input row, in the output row, replace each element with 5 if it is the maximum in its column, otherwise 0. But earlier checks didn't confirm this.\n\nExample0's column0: max3. So rows1 and2. So output rows1 and2 would have 5 in column0. But output for row0 has 5 in column0. So no.\n\nAnother idea: For each row in the input, if the row is composed of all the same elements, then in the output, the corresponding row has a 5 in the position equal to the number of such rows encountered so far. For example:\n\nExample0 has two such rows (row0 and row2). So the first one (row0) gets 5 in column0, the second (row2) in column1. But the output has row0 in column0, row1 in column1, row2 in column2. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s in the output are placed in the column corresponding to the order in which unique rows appear. For instance:\n\nExample0 has two unique rows (all same and not). The first unique row (all 2s) gets column0, then the next unique row (all 3s) gets column1. But the output has three 5s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Let's look at the test input and see if that can give a clue.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[2,3,2]\n\n[3,2,3]\n\nThe desired output would need to be determined based on the pattern. Let's try to apply the hypothesis that when not all rows are the same, each output row has a single 5 in a certain position, possibly based on the sorted order of the rows.\n\nThe test input rows:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nIf we sort these rows in descending order lexicographically:\n\nRow0:4,4,4 (highest)\n\nRow2:3,2,3\n\nRow1:2,3,2\n\nSo sorted order: row0, row2, row1.\n\nThen, the output would have 5s in column0 for row0, column1 for row2, and column2 for row1. So the output would be:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut what does this look like? The output rows would be:\n\nRow0: [5,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [0,5,0]\n\nBut how does this align with the training examples?\n\nIn Example1, when rows are sorted in descending order, the 5s are placed in the columns according to their sorted order. So the first row in sorted order gets 5 in column0, next in column1, etc.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the sorted order is row0, row2, row1. Thus, row0's output is [5,0,0], row2's output is [0,5,0], row1's output is [0,0,5]. But the test input's row1 is [2,3,2], row2 is [3,2,3].\n\nWait, the test input has row0 as [4,4,4], which is all same. So according to Examples2,3, if all rows are same, output first row is all 5s. But in this case, only row0 is all same. So the output should have row0 with a 5 in column0 (since it's the first row), and other rows based on their sorted order.\n\nBut according to the pattern from Example1, if the rows are sorted in descending order and the output's 5s are placed in the columns based on their sorted position, then row0 is first in sorted order, so output row0 gets 5 in column0. Then row2 is next, so output row2 gets 5 in column1. Row1 is last, so output row1 gets 5 in column2.\n\nBut the output would look like:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nWhich is different from the diagonal.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, Example4's input has two rows of [4,4,4] and one of [3,3,3]. The output is diagonal 5s. But according to the sorted hypothesis, sorted order would be row0, row1, row2. Then output 5s would be in column0 for row0, column1 for row1, column2 for row2. Which matches the Example4's output. So that supports the hypothesis.\n\nExample1's input is:\n\n[3,3,3], [4,2,2], [4,4,2]\n\nSorted descending lex order:\n\nRow1:4,2,2\n\nRow2:4,4,2\n\nRow0:3,3,3\n\nSo sorted order: row1, row2, row0.\n\nThus, output 5s would be in column0 for row1, column1 for row2, column2 for row0. So output rows:\n\nrow0: [0,0,5]\n\nrow1: [5,0,0]\n\nrow2: [0,5,0]\n\nBut the actual output for Example1 is:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\nWhich corresponds to row0 (3,3,3) being in the third position in the sorted order, row1 (4,2,2) first, row2 (4,4,2) second. So the output's row0 (original row0) would have 5 in column2, row1 in column0, row2 in column1. Which matches the actual output.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- Sort the input rows in descending lexicographical order.\n- For each row in the original input, determine its position in this sorted order.\n- The output row will have a 5 in the column corresponding to this position, and 0s elsewhere.\n- However, if multiple rows are identical, they all get 5s in the same column based on their first occurrence in the sorted list.\n\nFor example, in Example4:\n\nSorted order is row0 and row1 (both [4,4,4]), then row2 ([3,3,3]). But since rows0 and1 are identical, their sorted order is the same. However, in the output, each of them gets a 5 in their respective original row's position. Wait, but in Example4's output, both row0 and row1 have 5s in column0 and column1, which would correspond to their positions in the sorted order. But since they are identical, they would share the same position in the sorted list, so how is their output determined?\n\nAh, perhaps when rows are identical, they are considered as one group and the output 5s are placed in the columns based on their first occurrence in the sorted order. For example, in Example4's input, sorted order would be row0 and row1 (same), then row2. So the first group (row0 and row1) would be assigned column0, and row2 column2. But the output is diagonal, implying that each row's 5 is placed in their own column. This contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Let's re-examine Example4:\n\nInput:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nSorted lex descending order would have rows0 and1 first (since they are identical), then row2. So the sorted order is [row0, row1], row2.\n\nBut since rows0 and1 are identical, their position in the sorted list is considered as one. So the first position is occupied by both. Then, when assigning columns to the original rows, each row0 and row1 would get column0 (first in sorted order), and row2 would get column2 (third in sorted order). But the output for Example4 is diagonal, which implies row0's output is [5,0,0], row1's [0,5,0], row2's [0,0,5]. So each original row's output is in their own column, not the sorted position. So this breaks the previous hypothesis.\n\nBut this suggests that the sorted order is not the key factor. So what's different between Example1 and Example4?\n\nIn Example1, the output's 5s are arranged according to the sorted order of the rows. In Example4, they are arranged in the original row positions. The difference is that in Example1, all rows are unique, while in Example4, there are duplicate rows. \n\nSo maybe the rule is:\n\n- If all rows are the same, output first row all 5s, others 0s.\n\n- If there are duplicate rows but not all the same, each row's 5 is placed in their own column (diagonal).\n\n- If all rows are unique, the 5s are placed in the columns based on the sorted order of the rows.\n\nBut this feels ad-hoc and not consistent across examples.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: The output's 5s are placed in the column corresponding to the row's index in the input after sorting. For example:\n\nIn Example1, after sorting, the rows are row1, row2, row0. So in the output, row0 (original) would have 5 in column2, row1 in column0, row2 in column1. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example4, after sorting, the first two rows are identical, so the output could have their 5s in column0 and1, but the output is diagonal. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to apply this sorted order hypothesis to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nSorted lex descending order:\n\nRow0:4,4,4\n\nRow2:3,2,3\n\nRow1:2,3,2\n\nSo sorted order is row0, row2, row1.\n\nThus, the output for each original row:\n\n- Row0: first in sorted order \u2192 column0 \u2192 [5,0,0]\n\n- Row1: third in sorted order \u2192 column2 \u2192 [0,0,5]\n\n- Row2: second in sorted order \u2192 column1 \u2192 [0,5,0]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut how does this compare to the training examples?\n\nExample1's output matches this pattern. So this seems plausible. Let's check another example.\n\nExample0's input:\n\nRows:\n\nRow0:2,2,2\n\nRow1:3,2,3\n\nRow2:3,3,3\n\nSorted lex descending:\n\nRow2:3,3,3\n\nRow1:3,2,3\n\nRow0:2,2,2\n\nSo sorted order row2, row1, row0.\n\nThus, the output should be:\n\nRow0: third \u2192 column2 \u2192 [0,0,5]\n\nRow1: second \u2192 column1 \u2192 [0,5,0]\n\nRow2: first \u2192 column0 \u2192 [5,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output for Example0 is diagonal:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\nWhich contradicts the hypothesis. So this pattern doesn't hold for Example0.\n\nBut Example0's output is diagonal, which would suggest that each row's 5 is in their own column, not sorted order. So what's different between Example0 and Example1?\n\nIn Example0, two of the rows are all same. Perhaps when a row is all same, they are treated differently. For example, rows that are all same get 5s in their own column regardless of sorted order. While other rows are sorted.\n\nBut in Example0, rows0 and row2 are all same. So their 5s are in their own columns. Row1 is not all same, so its 5 is placed based on sorted order. But the output's row1 has 5 in column1, which is its own column, not based on sorted order.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the pattern is that if a row is all same, then its output has 5 in its original column. Otherwise, the 5 is placed in the column based on sorted order.\n\nBut in Example0's row1 is not all same, and its output is [0,5,0], which is column1, its original position. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to think of another angle.\n\nLooking at the output matrices, the sum of each row is 5. So each row has exactly one 5.\n\nThe output matrix is a permutation matrix where exactly one 5 per row and column.\n\nSo the output is a permutation matrix indicating some kind of ordering or mapping.\n\nIn Examples2 and3, the output's first row is all 5s, which is not a permutation matrix. So the rule must change when all rows are the same.\n\nSo the possible pattern is:\n\n- If all input rows are the same, output first row is all 5s, others 0.\n\n- Otherwise, the output is a permutation matrix where each row's 5 is placed in the column corresponding to the row's rank when sorted in lexicographical order (descending).\n\nThis fits Example1 and the test input, but not Example0.\n\nExample0's input rows are:\n\nRow0:2,2,2\n\nRow1:3,2,3\n\nRow2:3,3,3\n\nSorted lex descending:\n\nRow2:3,3,3\n\nRow1:3,2,3\n\nRow0:2,2,2\n\nThus, row2 is first, row1 second, row0 third.\n\nSo output should be:\n\nRow0:5 in column2\n\nRow1:5 in column1\n\nRow2:5 in column0\n\nWhich would give:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output for Example0 is diagonal:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\nSo this doesn't fit. Hence, the pattern isn't consistent.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[2,3,2]\n\n[3,2,3]\n\nThe rows are:\n\nRow0: all 4s.\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nIf the pattern is that for rows that are all the same, their 5 is in their own column. For other rows, the 5 is in the column where the row is the maximum in that column. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since row0 is all same, its 5 is in column0. For rows1 and 2, maybe compare their elements. Let's look at each column:\n\nColumn0:4,2,3 \u2192 max is4 (row0).\n\nColumn1:4,3,2 \u2192 max is4 (row0).\n\nColumn2:4,2,3 \u2192 max is4 (row0).\n\nBut row0's elements are all max in their columns. So output's row0 would have 5s in all columns. But according to the pattern in Examples2 and3, when all rows are same, output first row is all 5s. But here, only row0 is all same. So perhaps row0's output is [5,5,5]. But this contradicts with Example4 where two rows are same, and the output is diagonal.\n\nThis is really confusing. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make a guess based on the permutation matrix idea and the sorted order for unique rows.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nRows:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4] (all same)\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nSorted lex descending:\n\nRow0, row2, row1.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\nRow0:5 in column0\n\nRow1:5 in column2\n\nRow2:5 in column1\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut I need to check if this aligns with any training examples.\n\nExample1's output has a similar structure where the sorted order determines the 5s' columns. So this seems plausible.\n\nThus, the final answer for the test input would be:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So we have these input matrices and their corresponding outputs. The goal is to find out how the inputs are transformed into the outputs. Let me look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput:\n[2,2,2]\n[3,2,3]\n[3,3,3]\nOutput:\n[5,0,0]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,0,5]\nHmm. The output has 5s in positions where maybe the input rows are unique? Let's see. The first row in the input is all 2s. Then the second row is [3,2,3], and the third is all 3s. The output's first row has 5 at the first position and zeros elsewhere. The second row has 5 in the middle, and the third has 5 at the end. Wait, maybe each 5 in the output corresponds to a row that is unique in the input matrix. Let's check the rows here. The first row [2,2,2] is unique because the other rows have different elements. The second row [3,2,3] isn't the same as the others. The third row [3,3,3] is also unique. So maybe each unique row in the input is represented by a 5 in the output, but the position depends on the order of their uniqueness? Or perhaps it's related to the position of the row when sorted.\n\nWait, Example 0's output has 5s on the diagonal. So maybe for each unique row, the output row has a 5 in the column corresponding to its index? But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput:\n[3,3,3]\n[4,2,2]\n[4,4,2]\nOutput:\n[0,0,5]\n[0,5,0]\n[5,0,0]\nThe input rows are [3,3,3], [4,2,2], [4,4,2]. Let's see which are unique. All three rows here are different. So the output rows have 5s in different positions. The first output row has a 5 in the third position, the second in the middle, the third in the first. Hmmm. Maybe it's sorted in some order. Like the rows are sorted, and each 5 is placed according to their original position after sorting. Let's check:\n\nIf we sort the input rows in some order (maybe ascending), and then assign 5s based on their original positions. Let's see. For Example 1, input rows sorted numerically. Let's see each row as numbers. The first row is 3,3,3. Second is 4,2,2. Third is 4,4,2. When sorted, perhaps the order is determined by the sum of the row? Let's calculate the sum:\n\nFirst row sum: 3+3+3=9\nSecond: 4+2+2=8\nThird:4+4+2=10\nSo sorted by sum: second (8), first (9), third (10). Then the original rows are ordered as row 0 (sum 9), row1 (8), row2 (10). Wait, when sorted by sum, the order would be row1 (8), row0 (9), row2 (10). So the sorted order would be row1, row0, row2. Then in the output, each original row is assigned a 5 in the position corresponding to their sorted index. For example, row1 (original index1) is sorted first, so in the output, row1 (original index) would have 5 in position0? Wait, the output for Example1 is:\n\nRow0: [0,0,5]\nRow1: [0,5,0]\nRow2: [5,0,0]\n\nSo the original row0 in the input (which is [3,3,3], sum 9) is in the middle of the sorted list. So sorted order is row1 (sum8), row0 (sum9), row2 (sum10). Then original row0 is at position1 in the sorted list. So the output for original row0 would have 5 in position1? Wait, output row0 is [0,0,5], which is 5 in position2. Hmm, that doesn't align. Maybe the sorted order determines where the 5 is placed in the original row's position. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Each output row has a 5 in a position that corresponds to the rank of the input row when sorted. For example, in Example0, all three input rows are unique, and when sorted, they would be ordered as row0 (all 2s), row1 (3,2,3), row2 (all 3s). Wait, but how do you sort these rows? Maybe lex order. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, rows are [2,2,2], [3,2,3], [3,3,3]. Lex order would sort them as [2,2,2], then [3,2,3], then [3,3,3]. So the sorted order is row0, row1, row2. The output for each row has a 5 in their original row index. Wait, output rows have 5 in column0 for row0, column1 for row1, column2 for row2. That is, the diagonal. So maybe when all rows are unique, the output is a diagonal matrix with 5s on the diagonal. But wait, in Example0, that's the case. In Example1, all rows are unique, but the output isn't diagonal. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, in Example1, the output's 5s are in positions (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So 5s are placed in the reverse diagonal. Hmm. Let's think again. Maybe the rows are sorted in a certain order, and the 5s are placed in the column corresponding to their position in the sorted list, but in the original row's position. For example, if the sorted list is row1, row0, row2 (sums 8,9,10), then the first in the sorted list (row1) would get column0, row0 (sorted second) column1, row2 (sorted third) column2. But in the output for Example1, row0 (original row0) is in the third position of the sorted list, so gets column2. But row0's output is [0,0,5], which is 5 in column2. Similarly, original row1 (sum8, sorted first) would get 5 in column0. But row1's output is [0,5,0], so 5 in column1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternative idea: The output's 5 positions correspond to the row's position in a sorted list. But how?\n\nLooking at Example2 and Example3. Both have all rows the same. The output for Example2 is [5,5,5] in the first row, others zero. For Example3, same: first row is [5,5,5], others zero. So when all rows are the same, the first row in the output has all 5s and the rest zeros. But wait, in Example4, the input has two rows of [4,4,4] and one row of [3,3,3]. The output is [5,0,0], [0,5,0], [0,0,5], which is diagonal again. So perhaps when there's a tie in the rows, the diagonal is formed. Wait, in Example4, the first two rows are the same, and the third is different. Wait, but the input is:\n\n[4,4,4]\n[4,4,4]\n[3,3,3]\n\nSo rows 0 and 1 are same, row2 is different. The output has 5s in diagonal. So how does that work? Maybe the unique rows are assigned 5s in their original positions, but when there are duplicates, their 5s are grouped. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the frequency of the rows. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, each row is unique. Output has 5s in diagonal. Example1, each row is unique, output 5s in reverse diagonal. Hmm, but that's conflicting. Maybe the order in which the rows appear when sorted in reverse? For Example1, if the rows are sorted in descending order, perhaps [4,4,2] comes first, then [4,2,2], then [3,3,3]. Then the original rows would be ordered as row2 (sorted first), row1 (sorted second), row0 (sorted third). Then the output for row0 (original) would be in position2, which is 5 in column2. Similarly, row1 (original) is in position1 (5 in column1), row2 (original) is in position0 (5 in column0). That matches the output of Example1. So that's possible.\n\nSo the pattern could be: For each input matrix, sort the rows in descending order. Then, for each original row in the input, the output row has a 5 in the position corresponding to the index of that row in the sorted list. All other elements are 0. If multiple rows are the same, then when sorted, they will be grouped, and their output positions would be based on their sorted indices.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example0. Input rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\nRow1: [3,2,3]\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nSorted in descending order (lexicographical order?), which would be:\n\nCompare row0 and row1: row0 starts with 2, row1 with 3, so row1 comes after. Then row1 vs row2: row2 is [3,3,3], which is higher than [3,2,3]. So sorted order would be row2, row1, row0. Wait, no. Wait, when comparing [3,2,3] and [3,3,3], lexicographically, the first element is 3 in both. Second element: 2 vs 3. So [3,2,3] is less than [3,3,3]. So sorted in descending order would be row2, row0 is not. Wait, row0 is [2,2,2], which is lower. So sorted descending order would be row2 (3,3,3), row1 (3,2,3), row0 (2,2,2). So the sorted list is row2, row1, row0. Then the indices in the sorted list are: row2 is 0, row1 is 1, row0 is 2. So for each original row, their position in the sorted list would be:\n\nOriginal row0 (input row0) is in position2 of the sorted list. So in output row0, 5 is placed at index2. But in Example0's output, row0 has 5 at index0. So this doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I have the order reversed. Maybe the sorted list is in ascending order, and the 5 is placed at the original row's position in the sorted list. Let's try again.\n\nIn Example0, sorted in ascending order (lex order):\n\nRow0: [2,2,2] comes first.\n\nRow1: [3,2,3] next.\n\nRow2: [3,3,3] last.\n\nSo sorted order is row0, row1, row2. The original row0 is in position0, row1 in position1, row2 in position2. So output for row0 would have 5 in column0, which matches Example0's output. Similarly, row1's output has 5 in column1, and row2's in column2. So that makes sense.\n\nBut in Example1, the input rows are:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3]\nRow1: [4,2,2]\nRow2: [4,4,2]\n\nWhen sorted in ascending order (lex order), how are they ordered?\n\nLex order compares element by element. Let's compare row0 and row1. Row0 starts with 3, row1 with4, so row0 comes first. Then row1 and row2: row1 is [4,2,2], row2 is [4,4,2]. First element same (4), second element row1 is 2 vs row2's 4. So row1 comes before row2. So sorted order is row0, row1, row2. Then their positions in the sorted list are 0,1,2. So output should have 5s in diagonal. But Example1's output is:\n\n[0,0,5] (row0)\n[0,5,0] (row1)\n[5,0,0] (row2)\n\nWhich is 5s in columns 2,1,0. So reverse order. So that contradicts the initial idea.\n\nWait, perhaps the sorted order is in reverse, i.e., descending order. Let's check that.\n\nSorted in descending order for Example1:\n\nCompare rows. The largest lex order comes first. Let's see:\n\nRow2 is [4,4,2], which is higher than row1's [4,2,2], since second element 4>2. Then row1 is higher than row0's [3,3,3]. So sorted descending order is row2, row1, row0. So the original row0 would be at position2 in the sorted list. So the output for row0 would have 5 in column2, which matches Example1's output. Original row1 is in position1, so 5 in column1. Original row2 is in position0, so 5 in column0. So that's exactly what Example1's output shows. So this seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern is: sort the rows of the input matrix in descending lexicographical order. Then, for each original row, the output row has a 5 in the column corresponding to its index in this sorted list, and 0s elsewhere. If multiple rows are identical, they will have the same index in the sorted list, but how is that handled?\n\nLooking at Example2 and Example3, where all rows are the same. For Example2, all rows are [4,4,4]. When sorted in descending order, they all are the same, so the sorted list is [4,4,4], [4,4,4], [4,4,4]. Then each original row (all are same) will be in the first position (since sorted in descending, all are equal and take the first positions). But how are their indices assigned? Since all are the same, they would all be considered as the first in the sorted list, but when you have duplicates, their order is preserved? Or they are grouped, and in the output, which rows get which positions?\n\nIn Example2's output, the first row is [5,5,5], others are zero. So maybe when multiple rows are the same, they are considered as occupying the same position in the sorted list. But how to distribute the 5s. Wait, in Example4, the input is:\n\n[4,4,4]\n[4,4,4]\n[3,3,3]\n\nSorted in descending order, the first two rows are [4,4,4], then [3,3,3]. So the sorted list is row0, row1, row2. The original row0 and row1 are in the first two positions (since they are the same). But according to the output in Example4, the first two rows have 5s in columns0 and 1. So the output is:\n\n[5,0,0]\n[0,5,0]\n[0,0,5]\n\nWait, but the first two rows in the input are the same. According to the previous logic, they should be placed in the first position in the sorted list. So when there are duplicates, their indices in the sorted list would be the same. But in this example, the output for row0 (which is [4,4,4]) has 5 in column0, row1 (another [4,4,4]) has 5 in column1. But according to the sorted order, both are first. So maybe when there are duplicates in the sorted list, they are treated as per their original order. So in the sorted list, the rows are ordered first as the first occurrence, then the next, even if they are same. So in Example4, sorted in descending order, row0 comes before row1 (same rows, but original order preserved), then row2.\n\nSo the sorted list would be row0, row1, row2. Thus, in the output, row0 gets 5 in column0, row1 in column1, row2 in column2. Which matches Example4's output.\n\nAh, so the key here is that when rows are equal in the input, their original order determines their position in the sorted list. So when sorted in descending order, if two rows are equal, they are ordered based on their original positions. So in Example2, all rows are same, so the sorted order is row0, row1, row2. Then each row's output is 5 in their original column index. But in Example2's output, the first row is [5,5,5], others are zero. So this contradicts. Wait, no. Let me check Example2:\n\nInput:\n[4,4,4]\n[4,4,4]\n[4,4,4]\n\nOutput:\n[5,5,5]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nHmm. According to the previous logic, all three rows are same, so sorted in descending order, they would be ordered as row0, row1, row2. So their sorted indices are 0,1,2. So each original row would have 5 in column0,1,2. But the output's first row has all 5s, and the others are zero. That doesn't fit. So the previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the 5s are placed in the column corresponding to the count of how many rows are strictly greater than the current row. For example, for each row, count the number of rows (including itself) that are greater than or equal to it. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of Example2. All rows are same. So each row is equal to all others. So when sorted in descending order, their positions are maintained. So the sorted list is row0, row1, row2. So each row's position in the sorted list is their original index. Therefore, the output would be diagonal. But the actual output is [5,5,5] in the first row, others zero. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: The output's 5s are in the columns where the row is the 'maximum' row. Maybe if a row is the maximum in the matrix, it gets 5s in all positions, and others get zero. But Example2's output has the first row with all 5s. Since all rows are same, perhaps they are all considered maximum, but the output only allows one row to have 5s. Or perhaps the first occurrence of the maximum row gets all 5s.\n\nWait, in Example2, all rows are same, so they are all maximum. But the output is [5,5,5] in the first row. Others are zero. So maybe, when multiple rows are equal to the maximum, only the first occurrence in the sorted list gets all 5s. But how does this tie into other examples?\n\nWait, in Example3, input rows are all [3,3,3]. Output is [5,5,5] in first row, others zero. So same as Example2. So when all rows are same, the first row in the output has all 5s, others zero. So perhaps when multiple rows are tied as the maximum in the sorted list, only the first one (the earliest in the original order) gets 5s in its entire row, and others get zero. But how does that fit with other examples?\n\nFor Example4, input has two rows of [4,4,4], and one [3,3,3]. The sorted list is [4,4,4], [4,4,4], [3,3,3]. So the first two rows are same. According to the previous idea, the first row in the sorted list (row0) would have all 5s, and row1 (same as row0) would have zeros. But Example4's output is diagonal. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try another approach. Let's see the output rows and see if there's a pattern in their positions.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\n- When all rows are unique and sorted in descending order, the output 5s are in the reverse diagonal (Example1: 5s at (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)).\n\n- When all rows are same, first output row has all 5s, others zero.\n\n- When there are duplicate rows, but not all, like Example4, the output is diagonal. But in Example4, the first two rows are same, but the output is diagonal, which suggests that each row's 5 is placed in their original position. But why?\n\nWait, maybe it's based on the distinct rows. For example, in Example4, there are two distinct rows: [4,4,4] and [3,3,3]. The output is diagonal. So each distinct row is represented in the output with a 5 in their original positions. But why Example0 and Example1 have different behaviors?\n\nAlternatively, the number of distinct rows determines the pattern. If all are unique, then the output is a diagonal matrix. But Example1's output isn't diagonal. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the 5s are placed in the output matrix's columns corresponding to the order of the rows when sorted in descending order. For example, the first row in the sorted list gets 5 in the first column of each output row where it appears. Wait, that's not clear.\n\nWait, let's think of each row in the output as a permutation of the sorted rows. For Example0, sorted descending is row2, row1, row0. The output's first row (original row0) has 5 in column0. But original row0 is the last in the sorted list. So why column0? That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a permutation matrix where each row has a 5 indicating where the original row is placed in the sorted order. For instance, if after sorting, row0 is in position2, then the output row0 has a 5 in column2. So for Example0, sorted descending:\n\nsorted_list = [row2, row1, row0]\n\nThen, original rows are:\n\nrow0 is in position2 of the sorted list \u2192 output row0: 5 at column2.\n\nrow1 is in position1 \u2192 output row1: 5 at column1.\n\nrow2 is in position0 \u2192 output row2:5 at column0.\n\nBut in Example0's output, row0's 5 is at column0. So that's not matching. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is based on the sum of the rows. Let's check the sums:\n\nExample0 input rows:\n\nRow0 sum:6, row1:8, row2:9.\n\nSorted descending: row2 (9), row1 (8), row0 (6).\n\nOutput row0 has 5 in column0. So if the 5 is placed in the column corresponding to the sorted order, which would be column0 for row2, column1 for row1, column2 for row0. So in output, row0's sum is 6, which is third in sorted order, so column2. But the output for row0 has 5 in column0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s are placed in the column of the original row's rank. So for Example0, row2 is rank0 (highest sum), row1 rank1, row0 rank2. Then output row0 (rank2) would have 5 in column2, row1 in column1, row2 in column0. Which matches Example0's output. Let's check:\n\nExample0's output rows:\n\nrow0:5 at column0 \u2192 but according to this idea, row0's rank is2 \u2192 column2. Doesn't match.\n\nThis isn't working.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is a matrix where each element (i,j) is 5 if row i is the j-th largest row in the input, else 0. So for each row, find its rank (starting from 0) and place 5 in column j where j is the rank.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRows sorted descending (by sum or lex order):\n\nRow2 (sum9), row1 (sum8), row0 (sum6).\n\nRanks: row2 \u2192 0, row1\u21921, row0\u21922.\n\nOutput:\n\nrow0 (sum6, rank2) \u2192 column2:5 \u2192 but output row0 is [5,0,0]. So no.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the outputs, maybe the 5s are in the position corresponding to the count of rows that are less than the current row. For example, if a row is the largest, there are zero rows larger than it, so 5 in position0. But for Example0's row2 (sum9), which is the largest, how many rows are less? Two. So 5 in position2. But output for row2 is [0,0,5], which is position2. So maybe the 5 is in the column equal to the number of rows that are strictly less than the current row.\n\nWait, let's test this:\n\nExample0:\n\nRow0 sum6. Number of rows less than it: 0 (since other rows have higher sums). So 5 in column0. Output row0 has 5 in column0. Row1 sum8: only row0 is less. So count is1 \u2192 column1. Output row1 has 5 in column1. Row2 sum9: count of rows less than it is2 \u2192 column2. Output row2 has 5 in column2. This matches Example0.\n\nExample1:\n\nRows:\n\nRow0 sum9, row1 sum8, row2 sum10.\n\nRow0 sum9: other rows are row1 (8), row2 (10). So rows less than row0: row1. So count1 \u2192 column1. But output row0's 5 is in column2.\n\nThis doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output's 5 is in the column corresponding to the number of rows that are greater than or equal to the current row. For example, if a row is the first in the sorted order, the number of rows \u2265 to it is the total number of rows. Wait, not sure.\n\nLet me try Example0:\n\nRow2 is the largest. Number of rows \u2265 to row2 is 1 (only itself). So column0. Output row2 has 5 in column2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows strictly greater than the current row. For row2: 0. So column0. Output row2's 5 is in column2. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0 and Example1, when all rows are unique, the output matrix is a permutation matrix (each row and column has exactly one 5). In Example0, it's the identity matrix (diagonal), but in Example1, it's the reverse diagonal. When there are duplicate rows, like Example4, it's a diagonal matrix again. When all rows are same, the first row has all 5s, others zero.\n\nWait, what's different between Example0 and Example1? The way their rows are sorted. Maybe the permutation depends on the sorted order. So when rows are sorted in descending lex order, the permutation matrix is formed based on their original positions.\n\nFor example, sorted indices could be the order of the rows when sorted. The permutation matrix would have a 5 at (i,j) if the original row i is the j-th row in the sorted list.\n\nSo for Example0:\n\nSorted list (descending lex order):\n\nrow2: [3,3,3], row1: [3,2,3], row0: [2,2,2]\n\nSo the sorted indices are row2, row1, row0. So the permutation matrix would have:\n\nrow0 in the sorted list is at index2 \u2192 output row0 has 5 at column2.\n\nrow1 is at index1 \u2192 output row1 has 5 at column1.\n\nrow2 is at index0 \u2192 output row2 has 5 at column0.\n\nBut Example0's output is diagonal. So this would result in 5s in columns2,1,0 for rows0,1,2. But the actual output is diagonal. So this contradicts.\n\nAh, perhaps I have the permutation backwards. The permutation matrix's columns represent the original indices. For example, if in the sorted list, the first element is row2, then the permutation matrix would have a 5 at (2,0). But this isn't matching the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the permutation matrix is such that when you multiply the original matrix with it, you get the sorted matrix. But that's probably not relevant here.\n\nLet's look back at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[4,4,4]\n[2,3,2]\n[3,2,3]\n\nSo the input rows are:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nSorted in descending lex order:\n\nCompare row0: [4,4,4]\n\nCompare row2: [3,2,3] \u2192 starts with 3, less than 4. So row0 is first.\n\nNow, compare row1 [2,3,2] and row2 [3,2,3]. Which is larger lex order?\n\nRow2 starts with3, which is larger than row1's 2. So row2 comes next. Then row1 is last.\n\nSo sorted descending order is row0, row2, row1.\n\nSo the sorted indices are:\n\nOriginal row0 \u2192 index0 in sorted list.\n\nOriginal row2 \u2192 index1.\n\nOriginal row1 \u2192 index2.\n\nSo the output matrix should have:\n\nFor original row0 (sorted index0), 5 in column0 \u2192 [5,0,0].\n\nFor original row2 (sorted index1), 5 in column1 \u2192 [0,5,0].\n\nFor original row1 (sorted index2), 5 in column2 \u2192 [0,0,5].\n\nSo the output matrix would be:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nOriginal row0's output is [5,0,0].\n\nOriginal row1's output is [0,0,5].\n\nOriginal row2's output is [0,5,0].\n\nBut according to the pattern observed in previous examples, the output should be structured this way. For example, in Example1, the sorted order was row2, row1, row0. The output was:\n\nrow0 \u2192 sorted index2 \u2192 5 in column2.\n\nrow1 \u2192 sorted index1 \u2192 5 in column1.\n\nrow2 \u2192 sorted index0 \u21925 in column0.\n\nWhich matches Example1's output. So the pattern is that for each original row i, the output row i has a 5 in the column equal to the index of the original row i in the sorted list (sorted in descending lex order).\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nSorted list: row0, row2, row1.\n\nOriginal row0 is at sorted index0 \u2192 column0:5.\n\nOriginal row1 is at sorted index2 \u2192 column2:5.\n\nOriginal row2 is at sorted index1 \u2192 column1:5.\n\nThus, the output matrix is:\n\nrow0: [5,0,0]\n\nrow1: [0,0,5]\n\nrow2: [0,5,0]\n\nBut let's look at the training examples again to confirm.\n\nIn Example4:\n\nInput:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nSorted descending lex order: row0, row1, row2.\n\nSo original row0 is index0 \u2192 column0:5.\n\nrow1 is index1 \u2192 column1:5.\n\nrow2 is index2 \u2192 column2:5.\n\nWhich matches Example4's output.\n\nBut in Example2 and 3, all rows are same. So when sorted, they are ordered as row0, row1, row2. Thus, each row's index in sorted list is their original position. So the output should be diagonal. But in Example2 and 3, the output is [5,5,5] in the first row. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. What's different in Example2 and 3? All rows are the same. So when sorted, they all are equal. So their order is preserved. So sorted list is row0, row1, row2. So output should be diagonal. But the actual output is:\n\nExample2 output:\n\n[5,5,5]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nThis suggests that when all rows are the same, the first row in the output has all 5s, others zero. So perhaps there's a special case when all rows are identical. Or perhaps the pattern is that when multiple rows are the same, they are considered as a single group and the 5s are placed in the earliest row's column, and others are zero. So in Example2, all rows are same. So the earliest row is row0. So all rows' 5s are in column0, leading to the first row having all 5s. But this is a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, when multiple rows are equal, their indices in the sorted list are the same, but how is that handled. For example, in Example4, rows0 and1 are same. In sorted order, they are first two rows. So their indices are0 and1. So output is diagonal. But in Example2, all three rows are same, so in sorted order they are0,1,2. So output should be diagonal, but it's not. So this suggests that there's a special case when all rows are the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that when all rows are the same, the output's first row has all 5s and others zero. Otherwise, each row's 5 is placed in the column corresponding to their position in the sorted list.\n\nBut how to reconcile this with Example4. Example4's input has two rows same and one different. The output is diagonal. So the rows are sorted as row0, row1, row2. Each original row's index in sorted list is their original index. So output is diagonal.\n\nBut in Example2, all rows are same, and the output is first row with all 5s. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the pattern. Let me look again.\n\nIn Example4:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nSorted descending lex order: row0, row1, row2.\n\nSo original rows0 and1 are same, but in sorted order, they are first and second. So their indices in the sorted list are0 and1. So output rows0 and1 have 5s in columns0 and1. row2 is in index2, so column2. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example2, all rows are same. Sorted order is row0, row1, row2. So each original row's index in the sorted list is0,1,2. So output should be diagonal. But the actual output is [5,5,5] in row0, others zero. This doesn't fit.\n\nSo what's different between Example4 and Example2?\n\nIn Example4, two rows are same, one is different. In Example2, all rows are same.\n\nMaybe when there are multiple rows with the same value, but not all, they are treated as individual rows in the sorted order, but when all are same, it's a special case.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that if all rows are the same, then the first row has all 5s, others zero. Otherwise, each row has a 5 in the column corresponding to their index in the sorted list.\n\nThis would explain Example2 and Example3's outputs. But why?\n\nLet me test this hypothesis:\n\nFor Example0: not all same, so diagonal. Output is diagonal.\n\nExample1: not all same, so output is reverse diagonal (because sorted in descending order). But Example1's output is reverse diagonal.\n\nExample4: not all same, so diagonal.\n\nExample2 and3: all same \u2192 first row all 5s, others zero.\n\nSo this seems to be the case.\n\nBut how to determine when to apply this special case.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- If all rows in the input are the same, then the output's first row is [5,5,5], and others are zero.\n\n- Otherwise, for each row in the input, sorted in descending lex order, the output row has a 5 in the column corresponding to the index of that row in the sorted list. Other elements are zero.\n\nSo this explains:\n\nExample0: rows are unique \u2192 sorted descending order indices are row2, row1, row0. So output would have row2's 5 in column0, row1 in column1, row0 in column2. But Example0's output is diagonal. This contradicts.\n\nWait, no. Because according to this, the output for Example0 should be:\n\nsorted list: row2, row1, row0.\n\nOriginal row0 is in index2 \u2192 column2.\n\nrow1 in index1 \u2192 column1.\n\nrow2 in index0 \u2192 column0.\n\nSo output rows would be:\n\nrow0: [0,0,5]\n\nrow1: [0,5,0]\n\nrow2: [5,0,0]\n\nWhich is the reverse diagonal. But Example0's output is diagonal. So this is conflicting.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the pattern is different. Maybe the sorted order is ascending lex order.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nExample0 input rows:\n\n[2,2,2], [3,2,3], [3,3,3]\n\nSorted in ascending lex order:\n\nrow0, row1, row2.\n\nOriginal row0 is index0 \u2192 column0.\n\nrow1 index1 \u2192 column1.\n\nrow2 index2 \u2192 column2.\n\nWhich would result in diagonal output. Which matches Example0's output.\n\nExample1 input:\n\n[3,3,3], [4,2,2], [4,4,2]\n\nSorted in ascending order:\n\nrow0, row1, row2.\n\nOutput would have diagonal 5s. But Example1's output is reverse diagonal. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the sorted order is not ascending lex order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sorted order is determined by comparing rows in reverse lex order. Like, comparing the rows from right to left instead of left to right.\n\nFor example, in Example0's rows:\n\n[2,2,2], [3,2,3], [3,3,3].\n\nComparing from right to left:\n\nRow0: 2,2,2 \u2192 reversed: 2,2,2.\n\nRow1: 3,2,3 \u2192 reversed:3,2,3.\n\nRow2:3,3,3 \u2192 reversed:3,3,3.\n\nSorting these reversed rows in lex order (which would be ascending):\n\nrow0's reversed is [2,2,2], row1's [3,2,3], row2's [3,3,3]. So sorted order is row0, row1, row2. So same as before. Output diagonal.\n\nExample1's rows:\n\n[3,3,3] \u2192 reversed:3,3,3.\n\n[4,2,2] \u2192 reversed:2,2,4.\n\n[4,4,2] \u2192 reversed:2,4,4.\n\nSorted ascending on reversed rows:\n\nrow1's reversed is [2,2,4], row2's [2,4,4], row0's [3,3,3]. So sorted order is row1, row2, row0. So the indices are:\n\nrow0 \u2192 index2.\n\nrow1 \u2192 index0.\n\nrow2 \u2192 index1.\n\nSo output would be:\n\nrow0:5 in column2.\n\nrow1:5 in column0.\n\nrow2:5 in column1.\n\nWhich would result in output:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut the actual output for Example1 is:\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[5,0,0]\n\nWhich is row0:5 in column2, row1:5 in column1, row2:5 in column0. So this doesn't match.\n\nThus, this approach also doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let's think differently. Let's look for a pattern in the outputs.\n\nIn Example0 and Example4, when some rows are the same but others are not, the output is a diagonal matrix. But in Example1, with all unique rows, the output is reverse diagonal. In Examples2 and 3, all rows same, output first row all 5s.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0 and Example4, the output is a diagonal matrix. So perhaps when the matrix has rows that can be uniquely ordered (either all unique or some duplicates but with a clear maximum), the output is diagonal. But how does that fit with Example1's output being reverse diagonal?\n\nWait, Example1's input rows:\n\n[3,3,3], [4,2,2], [4,4,2]\n\nWhen sorted in descending lex order:\n\nrow2: [4,4,2]\n\nrow1: [4,2,2]\n\nrow0: [3,3,3]\n\nSo sorted list is row2, row1, row0.\n\nThus, the indices for original rows are:\n\nrow0 \u2192 index2 \u2192 5 in column2.\n\nrow1 \u2192 index1 \u21925 in column1.\n\nrow2 \u2192 index0 \u21925 in column0.\n\nWhich would give output rows:\n\nrow0: [0,0,5]\n\nrow1: [0,5,0]\n\nrow2: [5,0,0]\n\nWhich matches Example1's output. So this fits the pattern where the output is a permutation matrix based on the sorted order.\n\nSo the correct pattern seems to be:\n\n- Sort the input rows in descending lex order.\n\n- For each original row, place a 5 in the column corresponding to its index in this sorted list.\n\n- If multiple rows are identical, they are ordered in the sorted list based on their original positions (i.e., the first occurrence comes first in the sorted list if all else is equal).\n\nThis would explain:\n\nExample0's output: sorted list is row2, row1, row0. Output 5s in columns0 for row2, column1 for row1, column2 for row0. But Example0's output is diagonal. Wait, this doesn't match.\n\nWait, original row0 in Example0 is [2,2,2], which comes first in sorted ascending order. But in descending order, it comes last. So in sorted descending order, the rows are row2, row1, row0. So original row0 is in index2. So output row0 should have 5 in column2. But Example0's output row0 is [5,0,0], which is column0. So this contradicts.\n\nAh, perhaps I have a misunderstanding of lex order. Lex order for descending is comparing elements from left to right, and the first differing element determines the order. So for Example0:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nDescending lex order:\n\nComparing row0 and row1: row1's first element is3, which is higher than row0's2. So row1 comes before row0. Row2's first element is3. Compare row1 and row2. Row1's second element is2, row2's is3. So row2 comes before row1. So sorted descending order is row2, row1, row0. Thus, original row0 is in index2, row1 index1, row2 index0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nrow0:5 in column2 \u2192 [0,0,5]\n\nrow1:5 in column1 \u2192 [0,5,0]\n\nrow2:5 in column0 \u2192 [5,0,0]\n\nBut Example0's output is:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\nWhich is diagonal. So this contradicts. So this can't be the correct pattern.\n\nBut wait, Example0's output is diagonal. How is that possible? Maybe the sorted order is ascending lex order.\n\nSorted ascending lex order for Example0's rows:\n\nrow0, row1, row2.\n\nThus, original row0 index0 \u2192 column0.\n\nrow1 index1 \u2192 column1.\n\nrow2 index2 \u2192 column2.\n\nWhich matches the diagonal output of Example0.\n\nExample1's input rows when sorted ascending lex order:\n\nrow0: [3,3,3]\n\nrow1: [4,2,2]\n\nrow2: [4,4,2]\n\nSo sorted order is row0, row1, row2. So output diagonal. But Example1's output is reverse diagonal. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this suggests that Example0 and Example1 have different sorting orders, which is confusing.\n\nBut what if the sorting order is determined differently. For example, sorted based on the sum of the row. Let's try:\n\nExample0 row sums:\n\nrow0:6, row1:8, row2:9.\n\nSorted descending order of sums: row2 (9), row1 (8), row0 (6).\n\nThus, original row0's index is2 \u2192 column2.\n\nOutput for row0:5 in column2.\n\nBut Example0's output row0 is [5,0,0]. So no.\n\nThis is really confusing. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the outputs and see if there's a pattern related to the rows' elements.\n\nIn Example0, the input rows are:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[3,2,3]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nOutput diagonal. So maybe the 5s are in the same position as the first occurrence of the maximum element in each row.\n\nFor example, row0: all 2s \u2192 maximum is2. So first occurrence is position0. So 5 in column0.\n\nRow1: elements [3,2,3]. Maximum is3, first occurrence is0. So 5 in column0. But output row1 has5 in column1.\n\nSo that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output for each row has 5 in the position where the row's element is different from the previous row's element. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a diagonal matrix when each row is unique and sorted in ascending order. If that's the case, Example0's output makes sense. But Example1's output doesn't.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think about the test input and see what the answer might be.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[2,3,2]\n\n[3,2,3]\n\nSorted in descending lex order:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\n\nRow2: [3,2,3]\n\nRow1: [2,3,2]\n\nSo sorted list is row0, row2, row1.\n\nThus, the indices are:\n\nrow0:0 \u2192 column0.\n\nrow1:2 \u2192 column2.\n\nrow2:1 \u2192 column1.\n\nSo output matrix:\n\nrow0: [5,0,0]\n\nrow1: [0,0,5]\n\nrow2: [0,5,0]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut I need to check if this aligns with any of the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example1's sorted order:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[3,3,3], [4,2,2], [4,4,2]\n\nDescending lex order:\n\nrow2: [4,4,2]\n\nrow1: [4,2,2]\n\nrow0: [3,3,3]\n\nIndices:\n\nrow0:2 \u2192 column2.\n\nrow1:1 \u2192 column1.\n\nrow2:0 \u2192 column0.\n\nWhich gives output:\n\nrow0: [0,0,5]\n\nrow1: [0,5,0]\n\nrow2: [5,0,0]\n\nWhich matches Example1's output.\n\nThus, the pattern is to sort the rows in descending lex order and for each original row, place a 5 in the column corresponding to its index in this sorted list. Other elements are zero.\n\nBut in Example0, when sorted in descending lex order, the output is not diagonal. But according to this pattern, Example0's output should be:\n\nrow0: [0,0,5]\n\nrow1: [0,5,0]\n\nrow2: [5,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output of Example0 is diagonal. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, but Example0's input rows are:\n\n[2,2,2]\n\n[3,2,3]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nSorted in descending lex order:\n\nrow2: [3,3,3]\n\nrow1: [3,2,3]\n\nrow0: [2,2,2]\n\nThus, sorted indices:\n\nrow0:2 \u2192 column2.\n\nrow1:1 \u2192 column1.\n\nrow2:0 \u2192 column0.\n\nSo output should be:\n\nrow0: [0,0,5]\n\nrow1: [0,5,0]\n\nrow2: [5,0,0]\n\nBut Example0's actual output is diagonal. So this suggests that the pattern I'm thinking of is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the training examples, the pattern must fit all examples. So this indicates that my understanding of the sorted order is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the sorted order is in ascending lex order. For Example0, sorted ascending order would be row0, row1, row2. Thus, indices are0,1,2. Output diagonal. Which matches Example0's output.\n\nExample1's input sorted in ascending order:\n\nrow0: [3,3,3]\n\nrow1: [4,2,2]\n\nrow2: [4,4,2]\n\nSorted ascending order: row0, row1, row2.\n\nThus, output diagonal. But Example1's output is reverse diagonal. So this contradicts.\n\nThis is really confusing. Perhaps the correct pattern is that the output is the identity matrix (diagonal) when rows are sorted in ascending order, and a reverse diagonal when sorted in descending order.\n\nBut how to determine which one applies.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the output is a permutation matrix where the rows are sorted in ascending order and the permutation is based on that.\n\nBut this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, perhaps the correct approach is to apply the sorted descending lex order and the output is the permutation matrix based on that. Even though Example0's output contradicts this, but perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps in Example0, the rows are sorted in a different way. Let's recheck:\n\nExample0's input:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nSorted in descending lex order:\n\nRow2: [3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [3,2,3]\n\nRow0: [2,2,2]\n\nThus, the sorted order is row2, row1, row0. So original row0 is in index2. So output row0's 5 is in column2. But Example0's output row0 has 5 in column0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is a contradiction. So I must have misunderstood the pattern.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the output's 5s are based on the number of times the row's elements appear in the matrix. For example, if a row is unique, 5 is placed in a certain position. If duplicate, another position.\n\nIn Example0, all rows are unique. Each row's output has a 5 in their respective columns. But this doesn't fit with Example1.\n\nAlternatively, the output is based on the rows' positions when sorted in reverse order, and the 5s are placed in the reverse order of their sorted indices.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis, even if Example0 seems to contradict it. Perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nSorted descending lex order is row0, row2, row1.\n\nThus, output:\n\nrow0:5 in column0 \u2192 [5,0,0]\n\nrow1:5 in column2 \u2192 [0,0,5]\n\nrow2:5 in column1 \u2192 [0,5,0]\n\nWhich gives the output:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nBut looking back at Example4:\n\nInput:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[3,3,3]\n\nSorted descending order: row0, row1, row2.\n\nOutput: diagonal. Which aligns with this pattern.\n\nExample0's sorted order is row2, row1, row0. So output for row0 is column2, which isn't matching Example0's output. But according to the training data, Example0's output is diagonal. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is based on the rows' positions when sorted in ascending order.\n\nFor Example0, sorted ascending order is row0, row1, row2 \u2192 output diagonal.\n\nFor Example1, sorted ascending order is row0, row1, row2 \u2192 output diagonal. But Example1's output is not diagonal. So this is not possible.\n\nI'm really stuck. Perhaps I should look at the examples and see if there's a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: The outputs have 5s in the same positions as the elements in the input where that row is the maximum in its column. For example, in Example0's output:\n\nOutput is diagonal. So each 5 is in the position where the row is the maximum in that column.\n\nLooking at Example0's input:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0: 2,3,3 \u2192 max is3 (rows1 and2).\n\nColumn1:2,2,3 \u2192 max is3 (row2).\n\nColumn2:2,3,3 \u2192 max is3 (rows1 and2).\n\nBut the output is diagonal. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output 5s are in the columns where the row has the maximum value in the entire matrix.\n\nBut in Example0, row2 is all 3s, which are the max. So output row2 has 5s in all columns, but the output is diagonal.\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nFinal approach: Given the limited time and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that the rows are sorted in descending lex order, and each row's output has 5 in the column corresponding to its index in the sorted list. This explains Example1, Example4, and the test input. Example0's output would then be conflicting, but perhaps I made a mistake in the lex order comparison.\n\nFor the test input, the sorted descending order is row0, row2, row1. Thus, the output would be:\n\n[5,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5]\n\n[0,5,0]\n\nWhich matches the expected format.",
