        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of numbers, and the output seems to be a modified version of the input where some zeros are replaced by ones. But not all zeros\u2014there must be a specific rule.\n\nStarting with Example 0. Let's compare the input and output rows. Take the first input row: [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0, 9, 0, 2, 0, 9]. The output is [9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 8, 1, 9, 1, 2, 0, 9]. So the zeros are mostly replaced by ones, except the last 0 remains 0. Wait, the 12th element (if we count starting at 0) in the input is 0 and in the output it's still 0. Hmm, so maybe the last zero isn't replaced?\n\nWait, looking at other examples. In Example 1's input first row ends with several zeros, and in the output, some of those are replaced by ones. Let me check. The input is [0, 0, 2, 0, 9, 6, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0], and the output is [0, 0, 2, 0, 9, 6, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]. So the last four zeros become ones. Wait, but the first zero in the output is still zero. So maybe it's not the position but something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any zero that is between non-zero numbers gets replaced by 1. Let's check. For example, in the first input row of Example 0: [9,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,9,0,2,0,9]. The output replaces the zeros after 9 and before 2 with 1s. But there's a 0 before the 2 at position 5 which is already followed by a 2, but in the output, the 0s before the 2 are replaced. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait another approach: Maybe the zeros that are surrounded by non-zero numbers are turned into 1s. Let's see. For instance, in the first input row of Example 0: the zeros between 9 and 2 (positions 1-4) are all replaced by 1s. Then the zero after 8 (position 7) is replaced by 1. The zero after 9 (position 9) becomes 1. But the last zero (position 11) remains 0. So why? Because maybe the last zero is at the end of the list and there's no non-zero after it. So perhaps zeros that are between non-zero numbers (on both sides) get replaced. But in that case, the first zero in the row (position 0 in Example 1's first input) is 0, but in the output, it's still 0. So maybe leading or trailing zeros are not replaced, and only those between non-zero are replaced.\n\nWait, the first row of Example 1's input starts with 0,0,2,... The output for the first two zeros remains 0,0. But in the output, the zeros after the 1 (positions 12-15) are replaced by 1s. So maybe the zeros that are followed by a non-zero and preceded by a non-zero are replaced. Let's test that.\n\nTake the first input row of Example 0. The zeros after 9 (position 0) and before 2 (position 5): each 0 is between 9 and 2, but there's a sequence of zeros. So all those zeros become 1. The zero after 8 (position 7) is between 8 and 9. So replaced. The zero at position 9 is between 9 and 2 (since the next element is 2 at position 10). So replaced. The zero at position 11 is followed by 9. So why isn't it replaced? Because it's between 2 (position 10) and 9 (position 12). Wait, the input is [9,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,9,0,2,0,9]. The zero at position 11 is between 2 (position 10) and 9 (position 12). So in the output, it's replaced by 0. That contradicts the previous idea.\n\nWait in Example 0's output, the 12th element (0-based) in the first row is 0. The input there was 0. So maybe the last zero in each row is left as 0? Or perhaps zeros that are not part of a contiguous block are replaced. Alternatively, maybe the zeros that are followed by a non-zero but only if they are part of a sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace all zeros except those that are at the very end or beginning of the array. But in Example 0's first row, the first zero is replaced by 1. So that can't be. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: looking for runs of zeros. Maybe all zeros that are part of a run (sequence) surrounded by non-zero numbers get replaced. For example, in the first input row of Example 0, the zeros between 9 and 2 (a run of four zeros) are replaced. The zero between 8 and 9 (a single zero) is replaced. The zero between 9 and 2 (another single zero) is replaced. The zero between 2 and 9 (position 11) is not replaced. Wait, why is that zero not replaced? Because maybe the run is a single zero, but in other cases, single zeros are replaced. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that if a zero is followed by a non-zero, then it's replaced by 1. Wait, in the first input row of Example 0, the zeros are followed by a non-zero (except the last one). So zeros at positions 1-4 (followed by 2), 7 (followed by 9), 9 (followed by 2), 11 (followed by 9). But in the output, the zero at position 11 is not replaced. So that theory is invalid.\n\nLooking at the output for the first row of Example 0: [9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 8, 1, 9, 1, 2, 0, 9]. The only zero that remains is at position 11. The input there was 0. Why?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that a zero is replaced by 1 if it's between two non-zero numbers. Let's check:\n\nIn the first input row of Example 0:\n\n- The first zero is at position 1. The previous element is 9 (non-zero), next element is 0 (zero). So no, not between two non-zero. But in the output, it's replaced by 1. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe any zero that is either preceded or followed by a non-zero is replaced. But then leading zeros would be replaced if followed by non-zero. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1's first input row, the first two zeros are followed by 2. So they would be replaced. But in the output, those two zeros are left as 0. Wait, but the output for Example 1's first input row is [0,0,2,0,9,6,5,5,5,0,2,1,1,1,1]. The zeros at positions 0 and 1 remain 0, but the zeros at positions 3 and 9 are replaced by 0 and 0? Wait, no. Wait the input is [0, 0, 2, 0, 9, 6, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]. The output is [0, 0, 2, 0, 9, 6, 5,5,5,0,2,1,1,1,1]. So the zeros at the end (positions 12-14) are replaced by 1s. But in the input, those zeros are at the end. So maybe trailing zeros are replaced? But why the first two zeros (positions 0 and 1) are not replaced. They are leading zeros. So perhaps the rule is that any zero that is not at the start or end of the list is replaced. But in Example 0's first row, the last zero (position 11) is in the middle, but it's replaced by 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that all zeros are replaced by 1 except those that are the first occurrence of a zero in a run. Wait, maybe if there's a sequence of zeros, only the first one remains zero, and the rest become ones. But in Example 0's first input row, there's a run of four zeros (positions 1-4), and they are all replaced by 1. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros that are between two non-zero numbers are replaced. Let's check in Example 0's first input row. The zeros from positions 1-4: before is 9, after is 2. So between 9 and 2. All replaced by 1. The zero at position 7 is between 8 and 9. Replaced. The zero at position 9 is between 9 and 2. Replaced. The zero at position 11 is between 2 and 9. Why isn't that replaced? In the output, it's 0. That contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to replace all zeros except the last zero in the list. But in Example 0's first input row, the last zero is at position 11. The output has that as 0. But in Example 1's first input row, the last zeros are replaced. So that's not it.\n\nWait looking at another example. Let's take Example 2's first input row: [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,0,0,6,0,5]. The output is [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,0,5]. Here, the zeros at positions 3,5,6,10 (the 0s after 1,1,1) are replaced. Wait, in the input, after 1,1,1, there's a 0, then another 0, then 6. So in the output, the first 0 becomes 1, and the next 0 becomes 1. So all zeros after the 1s are replaced. But why the zeros at positions 3 and 5,6 in the input?\n\nHmm. Maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think of another approach. Looking at the outputs, the 1s seem to fill in certain regions. Maybe it's a flood fill algorithm where zeros are filled with 1s when they are reachable from the right or left without crossing a non-zero. For example, if a zero is enclosed by non-zeros on both ends, then it's filled. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace all zeros that are not at the beginning or end of the array, but that doesn't fit with the first example.\n\nWait, let's look for a pattern in the positions where zeros remain zeros. In Example 0's first output, the zero is at position 11. The input was 0. The next element is 9. So why isn't that zero replaced? It's between 2 and 9. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 2's first input row: the output changes some zeros to 1s, but leaves some as 0. For instance, the input had [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,0,0,6,0,5]. The output becomes [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,0,5]. So the zeros at positions 3,5,6 are left as 0. Then after the 1,1,1, the zeros are replaced by 1. The zero before 6 (position 7) is replaced by 6? Wait no, the input's position 7 is 6, so no. Wait, maybe the zeros that are between non-zero numbers on both sides, but not part of a leading or trailing sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any zero that is followed by a non-zero is replaced by 1. Let's test this:\n\nExample 0's first input row:\n\n9 followed by 0,0,0,0,2. The zeros are followed by 2 (non-zero), so replaced by 1. The 0 after 8 is followed by 9, replaced. The 0 after 9 is followed by 2, replaced. The 0 after 2 is followed by 9, but in the output it's 0. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace a zero with 1 if the previous element is non-zero. So any zero that comes after a non-zero is replaced. But in Example 0's first input, the first zero is after 9 (non-zero), so replaced. But in the output, that's true. The first 0 becomes 1. Then the next zeros are after 1 (which was a zero), so perhaps not. Wait, maybe it's the other way around: replace zeros where the next element is non-zero. So if a zero is followed by a non-zero, replace it with 1. Let's test:\n\nIn Example 0's first input:\n\nThe zeros at positions 1-4 are followed by 2 (non-zero), so they are replaced. The zero at position 7 is followed by 9 (non-zero), replaced. The zero at position 9 is followed by 2 (non-zero), replaced. The zero at position 11 is followed by 9 (non-zero), so according to this rule, it should be replaced, but in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't hold.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let's look at another example. Take Example 1's first input row:\n\nInput: [0,0,2,0,9,6,5,5,5,0,2,1,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [0,0,2,0,9,6,5,5,5,0,2,1,1,1,1]\n\nSo the first two zeros (positions 0 and 1) remain 0. The zero at position 3 (before 9) becomes 0. The zero at position 9 (before 2) becomes 0. The zeros at positions 12-14 (input 0s) become 1s. So according to this, why the zeros at the end are replaced?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that trailing zeros are replaced. But leading zeros are not. But in the output of Example 1's first row, the trailing zeros (positions 12-14) are replaced by 1s. But leading zeros (0 and 1) remain. So maybe trailing zeros are replaced, but leading zeros are not. But in Example 0's first row, there's a trailing zero (position 11) that's not replaced. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that all zeros except those that are part of the leading or trailing zeros are replaced. For example, if there's a run of zeros at the start or end, they are kept as 0, and internal zeros are replaced. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input has leading zeros (positions 1-4) after the initial 9. So maybe those are not leading, so they are replaced. The trailing zero is position 11 (after 2 and before 9) is not trailing. So why isn't that replaced?\n\nExample 1's first input has leading zeros (positions 0 and 1), which are kept. The zeros at positions 3 (between 2 and 9) are kept? No, in the output, position 3 is 0. But the input has a zero there. So according to the output, that zero is kept. So maybe any zero that is between non-zero numbers is replaced, except if it's part of leading or trailing. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace all zeros except those that are adjacent to a zero that remains zero. Like, if there's a contiguous block of zeros, only certain ones are kept. But this is vague.\n\nLooking at Example 2's first input row again:\n\nInput: [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,0,0,6,0,5]\n\nOutput: [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,0,5]\n\nSo the zeros at positions 3,5,6 are kept as 0. The zeros at positions 10-11 (input) become 1. The zero at position 14 (input) becomes 0. So maybe the rule is that if a zero is part of a group of zeros that are surrounded by non-zeros on both ends, then replace them. But positions 3,5,6 are zeros between 4 and 6 (position 3 is between 4 and 4, then 0,4,0,0,6). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced by 1s if they are between two non-zero numbers. For example, in Example 0's first row, the zeros between 9 and 2 are replaced. The zero between 8 and 9 is replaced. The zero between 9 and 2 is replaced. The zero between 2 and 9 is not. Wait, why? Because maybe in that case, the zero is between 2 and 9, but in the output, it's kept as 0. That contradicts the rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace zeros that are in even positions or odd positions. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, sometimes zeros are replaced with 1 even if they are adjacent to other zeros, but sometimes not. Maybe it's about being in certain regions. For example, the zeros that are to the right of the first non-zero and to the left of the last non-zero in the row. So any zero within the range between the first and last non-zero is replaced by 1. Let's test this.\n\nTake Example 0's first input row: [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0, 9, 0, 2, 0, 9]. The first non-zero is 9 (position 0). The last non-zero is 9 (position 12). So the range is from 0 to 12. All zeros in this range should be replaced. The output shows that the zero at position 11 is 0. But according to this, it's in the range, so should be replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first and last elements are left as is, and all zeros in between are replaced. But in Example 0's first row, the first element is 9, and the last is 9, and the zeros between are replaced. Except for the zero at position 11. Hmm, no.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to replace all zeros except those that are followed by a zero. For example, if a zero is followed by another zero, leave it as 0. Otherwise, replace with 1. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's first input row: The zeros are positions 1-4 (all followed by zeros except the last one), position 7 followed by 9 (non-zero), position 9 followed by 2 (non-zero), position 11 followed by 9 (non-zero).\n\nIf the rule is replace zeros followed by non-zero with 1, and leave others as 0. Then:\n\n- Position 1: followed by 0 \u2192 0\n- Position 2: followed by 0 \u2192 0\n- Position 3: followed by 0 \u2192 0\n- Position 4: followed by 2 \u2192 1\n- Position 7: followed by 9 \u2192 1\n- Position 9: followed by 2 \u2192 1\n- Position 11: followed by 9 \u2192 1\n\nBut the output for Example 0's first row is [9,1,1,1,1,2,8,1,9,1,2,0,9]. So the zeros at positions 1-4 are all replaced by 1, which contradicts this rule.\n\nHmm. This is getting tricky. Maybe I need to look at another example.\n\nTake Example 2's first row input again: [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,0,0,6,0,5]\n\nOutput: [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,0,5]\n\nThe zeros at positions 3,5,6 are followed by 4, 0, and 6. So:\n\n- Position 3: followed by 4 (non-zero), so replaced. But in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros that are part of a sequence that starts and ends with non-zero numbers. For example, a run of zeros between two non-zeros. All zeros in such runs are replaced by 1.\n\nLet's check Example 0's first row:\n\nThe zeros from position 1-4 are between 9 and 2. So replaced by 1.\n\nThe zero at position 7 is between 8 and 9. Replaced.\n\nThe zero at position 9 is between 9 and 2. Replaced.\n\nThe zero at position 11 is between 2 and 9. So why not replaced? In the output, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that if a zero is part of a consecutive sequence of zeros that is bounded by non-zero on both ends, then replace all with 1. Otherwise, leave as 0.\n\nIn Example 0's first row, the zeros from 1-4 are bounded by 9 and 2, so replaced.\n\nThe zero at position 7 is between 8 and 9 (single zero), replaced.\n\nThe zero at position 9 is between 9 and 2 (single zero), replaced.\n\nThe zero at position 11 is between 2 and 9 (single zero), but in output it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let's think of the outputs as filling zeros with 1s, but leaving certain zeros as is. For example, maybe the first occurrence of a zero after a non-zero is left as 0, and subsequent zeros in the same run are replaced by 1. But looking at Example 0's first input row, the first zero is replaced by 1, which contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced by 1 except when they are the first zero in the entire list. But no, in Example 0's first row, the first zero is replaced.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is to replace all zeros except those that are part of the first or last run of zeros. For example:\n\nIn Example 1's first row, the leading zeros (positions 0 and 1) are left as 0, and the trailing zeros (positions 12-14) are replaced. But in the output, the trailing zeros are replaced by 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros that are part of the first or last run of zeros are left as 0, and all others are replaced. Let's test:\n\nExample 0's first input row starts with 9 followed by zeros. The leading run after the first element is zeros from positions 1-4. But according to this rule, those zeros are not leading the entire row, so they are replaced. Which they are. The last zero in the row is position 11, which is not part of a trailing run (since the last element is 9). So that zero is replaced. But in the output, it's left as 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to find a different approach. Maybe looking for the difference between input and output in terms of the positions where zeros are replaced.\n\nIn Example 0's first row, the zeros replaced are positions 1-4,7,9,11. Wait no, the output for the first row is [9,1,1,1,1,2,8,1,9,1,2,0,9]. So the input zeros are at positions 1-4,7,9,11. The output has 1s in positions 1-4,7,9, but position 11 is 0. So why was position 11 not replaced?\n\nLooking at the input for that position: the element before is 2 (position 10), and after is 9 (position 12). So it's between two non-zero. But in the output, it's 0. That's strange. What's different about that zero?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to replace zeros with 1 only if they are between two non-zero numbers and are part of a run of zeros. So if it's a single zero between two non-zero, it's left as 0. But if it's part of a longer run, they are replaced. But in Example 0's first row, the single zero at position 7 is replaced, so that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace all zeros except those that are immediately followed by a non-zero and preceded by a non-zero. Wait, that would mean that a zero between two non-zero would be replaced. But in the case of position 11 in Example 0's first row, it's between 2 and 9 (both non-zero), but it's not replaced. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that a zero is replaced by 1 unless it is the first or last element in the row. But in Example 0's first row, the last element is 9, not zero. So that's not applicable.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the output arrays and see if there's a connection to the number of non-zero elements. Maybe the output has all the same non-zero elements as the input, and the zeros are replaced by 1s except in certain cases. For example, perhaps the first and last zeros are kept as 0, and others replaced. But in Example 0's first row, the first zero is replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the zeros are replaced by 1 if they are adjacent to a non-zero in any direction. So leading zeros that are followed by non-zero are replaced. Trailing zeros preceded by non-zero are replaced. Let's test:\n\nExample 0's first row:\n\nPosition 1: zero after 9 (non-zero) \u2192 replaced.\n\nPosition 2: zero after 1 (which was replaced) \u2192 but adjacent to non-zero (previous position is 1 now). Hmm, this gets complicated.\n\nAlternatively, considering the output as the input with all zeros replaced by 1 except those that are adjacent to a zero in the input. So, if a zero in the input is next to another zero (either before or after), it remains 0. Otherwise, replaced by 1.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample 0's first input row:\n\nZeros at positions 1-4 are consecutive. So they are all adjacent to other zeros. So according to this rule, they remain 0. But in the output, they are replaced by 1. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the opposite: replace zeros that are adjacent to at least one zero. No, that would mean replacing more.\n\nWait, this is taking too long. Maybe the pattern is that all zeros are replaced by 1, except for the zeros that are part of a group of exactly one zero between two non-zeros. For example, a single zero between non-zeros remains 0, while groups of two or more are replaced by 1. Let's test:\n\nExample 0's first row has a group of four zeros (positions 1-4) \u2192 replaced by 1s. A single zero at position 7 \u2192 replaced by 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the opposite: replace single zeros between non-zeros and leave groups. But that doesn't fit either.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to replace all zeros with 1s except when the zero is the only one between two identical numbers. For example, if a zero is between two same numbers, leave it as 0. Otherwise, replace with 1. Let's check Example 0's first row:\n\nThe zero at position 7 is between 8 and 9 (different numbers) \u2192 replaced. The zero at position 9 is between 9 and 2 \u2192 replaced. The zero at position 11 is between 2 and 9 \u2192 replaced. But in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that zeros are replaced by 1s except when they are between two even numbers, or some other numerical condition. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros are replaced by 1s if their position is even or odd. For example, even positions' zeros are replaced. But in Example 0's first row, position 11 is odd (assuming 0-based) and is left as 0. But other odd positions are replaced. So no.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for a different pattern. Let's compare the input and output for all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nIn the output, many zeros are replaced with 1s. But not all. For example, in the first row, the last zero is left as 0. Looking at the input, this zero is between 2 and 9. In the output, it's still 0. But why?\n\nLooking at the other examples:\n\nIn Example 1's first input row, the zeros at positions 12-14 are replaced by 1s. In the input, those zeros are at the end. In the output, they are replaced. So trailing zeros are replaced. But in Example 0's first row, the last zero is not trailing. It's followed by 9.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is to replace all zeros except those that are between two even numbers. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first row's last zero is between 2 and 9. 2 is even, 9 is odd. So replaced. But output is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, between two even numbers. If the numbers before and after are even, leave zero as 0. Otherwise, replace. For example, in the first row of Example 0, the zero at position 11 is between 2 (even) and 9 (odd). So replaced, but output is 0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, between two odds. Maybe if the zero is between two odd numbers, it's replaced. 2 is even and 9 is odd. So no. But output is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the zeros that are at positions where the sum of the digits of the index is even or odd. Not likely, but let's check. Position 11 in Example 0's first row: index is 11 (1+1=2, even). Replaced. But output is 0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the number of non-zero elements before the zero. Not sure.\n\nMaybe the pattern is to replace all zeros except those that are directly between two specific numbers, like 2 and 9. But in Example 0's first row, the zero between 2 and 9 is replaced by 0, which contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace zeros with 1s except when the zero is between two numbers that are the same. For example, between 9 and 9. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first row has a zero between 2 and 9. Not same. So replaced. But output is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample 2's first row has zeros replaced between 7 and 4, which are different. So replaced. But output shows replaced.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Let's try to find another approach. Perhaps the pattern is to look for the positions where zeros are replaced in the output and see if there's a relation to their position in the list.\n\nIn Example 0's first row, the only zero not replaced is at position 11. Let's see if that's the case in other rows.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe second input row is [1,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,5]. Output is [1,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,5]. All zeros except position 0 are replaced. Wait, no. The input row starts with 1, then 0,0,6. The output is all 1s except the first element. So the zeros in positions 1,2 are replaced. So no, that's not the same as the first row.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the pattern is to replace all zeros except those that are at positions where the sum of the digits of the element's value is a certain number. For example, if the element is zero and the sum of other digits in the row meets a condition. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is related to the number of non-zero elements in the row. For example, replace zeros with 1s until a certain count. But this is unclear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for a different approach. Perhaps the transformation is to replace all zeros with 1s except for the first and last zero in each row. Let's test:\n\nExample 0's first row has multiple zeros. The first zero is at position 1. The last zero is at position 11. Are they kept as 0? No, in the output, position 1 is 1, position 11 is 0. So maybe the last zero in the row is kept. But other rows have different behaviors.\n\nExample 0's second row input: [1,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,5]. The output replaces all zeros except the last zero (position 11) is part of 9,5. Wait, in the input, the zeros are between 1 and 6, then after 6. The output has all zeros replaced except the last zero (position 11) is part of 9,5. No, the output's last two elements are 9,5, which are original. So the input's zeros are all replaced except perhaps none. But in the output, the zeros are all replaced except the first element is 1 (the input's first element was 1). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the pattern is to replace all zeros with 1s except those that are at the same position as a zero in the previous row. But this seems complicated and not applicable across different examples.\n\nWait, looking at the first output of Example 0, the only zero left in the first row is at position 11. Let's check what the input was: 0. The output is 0. Why is this zero left? Maybe it's because it's followed by a 9, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to replace all zeros except those that are followed by a number higher than 8. In Example 0's first row, the zero at position 11 is followed by 9. So it's replaced by 0. But in other cases, zeros followed by higher numbers are replaced. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm going to try to find any other possible pattern. Let's look at the sum of the input and output for each row. For Example 0's first row:\n\nInput sum: 9+0+0+0+0+2+8+0+9+0+2+0+9 = 9+2+8+9+2+9 = 39.\n\nOutput sum:9+1+1+1+1+2+8+1+9+1+2+0+9 = 9+4 + 2+8+1+9+1+2+0+9 = 9+4=13, 13+2=15, +8=23, +1=24, +9=33, +1=34, +2=36, +0=36, +9=45. So sum increased. Not sure if relevant.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the rule is to replace all zeros except those that are adjacent to a number greater than 5. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first row's zero at position 11 is between 2 and 9. 9 is greater than 5. So according to this rule, the zero would be replaced. But in the output, it's 0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the zero is between two numbers greater than 5. 2 is not greater than 5, so rule doesn't apply. So output is 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the previous number is even and the next is odd, then replace. 2 is even, 9 is odd. So replaced. But output is 0. So no.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let's think of the output as a mask where certain zeros are filled. Maybe the rule is that any zero that is not the first or last zero in the entire array is replaced. But this varies by row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each row, all zeros are replaced with 1 except the last occurrence of zero in the row. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first row: the last zero is at position 11. So it remains 0. Others replaced. Which matches the output. Yes! Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's first input row has zeros at positions 1,2,3,4,7,9,11. The last zero is position 11. So in the output, all zeros except position 11 are replaced by 1. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 0's second input row is [1,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,5]. The zeros are at positions 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. The last zero is position 10. So in the output, all zeros except position 10 are replaced. But the output is [1,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,5]. So the last zero is position 10, which is replaced by 1. That contradicts.\n\nHmm, so that theory is wrong.\n\nAnother Idea: The last zero in each row is left as 0. Let's check Example 0's first row. The last zero is at position 11. Output has 0 there. Yes. Example 0's second row input: zeros at positions 1-10,11 is 9. So the last zero is position 10. Output for that position is 1. So no. So this theory is invalid.\n\nLooking at Example 1's first row input: the zeros are at positions 0,1,3,9,12,13,14. The last zero is position 14. Output replaces those with 1. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the pattern is to replace all zeros with 1 except those that are at positions where the index is a multiple of a certain number. For example, even indices. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's first row's zero at position 11 (index 11, which is odd) is left as 0. Other zeros at even indices: positions 1 (odd), 2 (even), etc. No, it doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first zero in each row is left as 0, and others replaced. Example 0's first row has first zero at position 1, replaced. So no.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's consider that the zeros are replaced by 1 except when the zero is adjacent to a 9. For Example 0's first row's zero at position 11 is next to 9 (position 12). So it's adjacent to 9. So according to this rule, left as 0. Other zeros adjacent to 9:\n\n- Position 4: followed by 2. Not adjacent to 9. Replaced.\n- Position 7: followed by 9. So adjacent. Replaced? Output is 1. So rule not followed.\n\nSo this is not it.\n\nAt this point, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to look at the problem differently. Perhaps the pattern is to replace all zeros except those that are between two zeros. For example, if a zero is between two zeros, leave it as 0. Otherwise, replace. Let's test:\n\nExample 0's first row:\n\nZeros at positions 1-4 are consecutive. So between zeros. So according to rule, left as 0. But output is replaced by 1. So no.\n\nExample 2's first row input has zeros at positions 3,5,6. These are part of a group. So according to rule, left as 0. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 0's first row has zeros in positions 1-4: replaced by 1. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. This is very frustrating. I think I'm missing something obvious.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, the replaced zeros are filled with 1s in such a way that the output arrays have 1s where there were zeros in the input, but only in certain regions. It looks like the 1s are filling all the zeros except those that are part of the first or last run of zeros in each row.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's first row, the leading zeros (first two) are kept, and the trailing zeros (last three) are replaced. But the output shows that the trailing zeros are replaced. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the zeros are replaced by 1s except when they are between two non-zero numbers that are both greater than 5. For Example 0's first row, the zero at position 11 is between 2 (<=5) and 9 (>5). So one side is greater than 5, the other not. So replaced. But output is 0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, between two numbers that sum to more than 10. 2 +9=11>10. So maybe leave as 0. But the zero is replaced by 0 in the output. So yes. Let's check other cases.\n\nIn Example 0's first row, the zero at position 7 is between 8 and 9. Sum is 17>10. So replaced by 1. But according to this rule, it would be left as 0. So no.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I'm going to take a guess based on the examples. The pattern seems to be that in each row, replace all zeros with 1 except the last zero encountered when moving from left to right. But let's check.\n\nExample 0's first row input: [9,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,9,0,2,0,9]. The zeros are at positions 1,2,3,4,7,9,11. The last zero is at 11. So replace all except 11. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 0's second row input: [1,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,5]. Zeros at positions 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. The last zero is at position 10. So replace all except position 10. The output for this row is [1,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,5]. So all zeros are replaced. That contradicts. So no.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the last occurrence of a zero in each row is left as 0, and all others replaced. Let's test:\n\nExample 0's first row: last zero at position 11. Output has 0 there. Correct.\n\nExample 0's second row: last zero at position 10. Output has 1 there. So no.\n\nSo this theory is incorrect.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's second row input: the last zero is at position 10 (0-based), which is replaced by 1. So the theory doesn't hold.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the zeros are replaced by 1s except those that are followed by a number that is a multiple of 3. For Example 0's first row's zero at position 11 is followed by 9, which is a multiple of 3. So left as 0. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first row's zero at position 7 is followed by 9 (multiple of 3). So according to this rule, it would be left as 0. But in output, it's replaced by 1. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the previous number is a multiple of 3. For position 11, previous number is 2 (not multiple of 3). So replaced. Output is 0. So no.\n\nI'm running out of ideas. Based on the examples, the pattern seems to be that all zeros are replaced with 1 except those that are at the end of the row. But in Example 0's first row, the zero isn't at the end. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is to replace all zeros except those that are followed by a number greater than 8. In Example 0's first row's zero at position 11 is followed by 9. So left as 0. Let's check:\n\nExample 1's first row's zero at position 14 is followed by nothing (end of row), but in output it's replaced by 1. So no.\n\nAnother Idea: In the output, the only zeros that remain are those that are followed by a number less than the previous number. For example, in Example 0's first row, zero at position 11 is between 2 and 9. 9 is greater than 2. So replaced, but output is 0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the zero is between two numbers where the first is even and the second is odd. Example 0's first row, zero at position 11: 2 (even) and 9 (odd). So left as 0. Let's test other cases:\n\nExample 0's zero at position 7 is between 8 (even) and 9 (odd). Replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. I think I need to give up and try to write the code based on the examples.\n\nBut since I need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the pattern that seems to hold in most cases: replace all zeros except the last one in each row. However, this doesn't hold in all examples. But given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this assumption.\n\nLooking at the Test Input rows:\n\nFor each row in the test input, I need to replace all zeros with 1 except the last zero.\n\nLet's take the first test input row: [0,0,0,8,0,5,0,0,9,0,6,0,0,0,0,5]\n\nThe zeros are at positions 0,1,2,4,6,7,9,11,12,13,14. The last zero is position 14. So replace all zeros except position 14 with 1. But the output for this row would have 0 at position 14, and others as 1.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's first row, the last zero is not the last element. The last element is 9. So the last zero is at position 11. So the last zero is the last occurrence of zero in the row, not the last element.\n\nSo for each row in the test input, we replace all zeros with 1 except the last occurrence of zero (the rightmost zero).\n\nApplying this to the first test row:\n\nOriginal: [0,0,0,8,0,5,0,0,9,0,6,0,0,0,0,5]\n\nZeros are at positions 0,1,2,4,6,7,9,11,12,13,14. The last zero is position 14. So replace all zeros except position 14 with 1. So the output row would be [1,1,1,8,1,5,1,1,9,1,6,1,1,1,0,5].\n\nLet's check the other examples to see if this holds.\n\nExample 0's first row: the last zero is at position 11. So replace all others. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 1's first row: zeros at positions 12-14. The last zero is 14. So replace all except 14. The output for this row ends with 1,1,1,1. So this contradicts. So this theory is invalid.\n\nHmm. So this pattern doesn't hold for Example 1. So I must be wrong.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nLooking back at the examples, in each output row, the zeros that remain are the ones that were in the same position as the original input's zeros but not surrounded by non-zero numbers. But I can't find the exact pattern.\n\nAnother possible pattern is that every zero is replaced by 1 except if the zero is followed by a 0 in the input. So if a zero is part of a run, the first zero in the run remains 0, others are replaced. But in Example 0's first row, a run of four zeros, all are replaced by 1. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first zero in a run is kept, others replaced. Example 0's first row's run of four zeros: first is kept as 0, others replaced. But output shows all replaced. So no.\n\nAt this point, I think the correct pattern is to replace all zeros with 1s except those that are the first zero in each run of zeros. But in Example 0's first row, the first zero in the run (position 1) is replaced, which contradicts.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the zeros are replaced by 1s except when they are followed by a number that is the same as the previous non-zero. For Example 0's first row's last zero is between 2 and 9. 2 and 9 are different. So replaced. Output is 0. So no.\n\nI give up. Based on the examples, the pattern seems to be replacing all zeros with 1s except the last occurrence in each row, but this doesn't fit all cases. However, given the examples provided, I'll proceed with this approach for the test input.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of numbers, and the output seems to be modifying some of those numbers. Let's compare the input and output for Example 0 first.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row is [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0, 9, 0, 2, 0, 9], and the output is [9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 8, 1, 9, 1, 2, 0, 9]. Hmm, I notice that the 0s are being replaced by 1s, but not all of them. The last element in the input is 9, which stays the same. Wait, the output has a 0 at the 11th position (index 11?), which in the input was also 0. So maybe there's a condition where certain 0s are left as 0s.\n\nLooking at another example. In Example 1's input, the first row ends with four 0s, which in the output are replaced by 1s except the last one maybe? Wait, no. Let's check. The input is [0,0,2,0,9,6,5,5,5,0,2,1,0,0,0] and the output is [0,0,2,0,9,6,5,5,5,0,2,1,1,1,1]. Oh, so the last three 0s in the input become 1s. But the first 0s in the row (like the first two 0s) remain 0. So maybe the rule isn't to replace all 0s with 1s. Maybe it's replacing 0s that are followed by non-zero numbers, or maybe it's something to do with the position relative to non-zero numbers.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for runs of zeros. For instance, in Example 0's first input row, there's a run of four 0s starting at index 1. The output replaces those with 1s except the last one? Wait, no. The output has all 1s there. Wait, the input is [9,0,0,0,0,2,...], and output is [9,1,1,1,1,2,...]. So all the 0s in that run become 1s. But then later in the same input row, there's a 0 at index 10 (input value 0), which in the output becomes 2? Wait no, the input is 0,2,0,9, so in the output it's 1,2,0,9. So that 0 becomes 0 in the output. Wait, the third 0 in the input row (index 10) becomes 0 in the output. So maybe the rule is to replace all 0s except those that are the last element of a run of zeros? Or maybe it's that 0s are replaced by 1s except when they are adjacent to a non-zero on both sides? Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. For example, in the first row of input [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,0,0,6,0,5], the output is [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,0,5]. So the 0s at positions 3 and 5-6 (indices 3,5,6) in the input are 0, 0, 0. The output for those is 0,0,0? Wait no. Wait, input is [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,0,0,6,0,5]. Output is [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,0,5]. So the 0s at indices 3,5,6 remain 0, but the 0s at indices 10,11,12 (after the 1s) are replaced with 1s. So the 0s after the 1s are turned into 1s? Hmm. But then in the same output row, the 0 at index 14 (0 before 5) remains 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 0 that is followed by a non-zero (i.e., the next element is non-zero) is replaced by 1. But looking at Example 0's first input row: [9,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,9,0,2,0,9]. The first four 0s are followed by a 2. So those 0s would be replaced by 1s. The next 0 is at index 7 (after 8), which is followed by 9. So that 0 becomes 1. Then the 0 at index 9 is followed by 2, so becomes 1. The 0 at index 11 is followed by 9, so that would become 1. But in the output, the 0 at index 11 remains 0. So that contradicts that idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that 0s are replaced by 1s unless they are at the end of the list. But in Example 0, the last element is 9, so that's not the case.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe it's about the zeros that are surrounded by non-zero numbers. For example, a 0 that is between two non-zero numbers becomes 1. But in the first example's input row, the four 0s between 9 and 2 would all be in the middle. So they become 1s. The 0 after 8 (index7) is between 8 and 9, so that becomes 1. The 0 after 9 (index9) is between 9 and 2, becomes 1. The 0 at index11 is between 2 and 9, so why is that 0 left as 0 in the output? That's confusing. Unless there's a different rule.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output, the 0 at index11 in the input (0) becomes 0 in the output. So why wasn't that replaced? Let's check the input and output again. Input row in Example 0 is [9,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,9,0,2,0,9]. The output is [9,1,1,1,1,2,8,1,9,1,2,0,9]. So the 0 at index11 (input) becomes 0 in output. But the 0 at index9 (input) becomes 1. So why the difference? The 0 at index11 is between 2 and 9. Maybe the rule is that if a 0 is followed by another 0, then replace the leading 0s except the last one? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about replacing all 0s except those that are at the end of the array. But in Example 0's output, the last element is 9, so not a zero. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input first row: [0,0,2,0,9,6,5,5,5,0,2,1,0,0,0]. The output is [0,0,2,0,9,6,5,5,5,0,2,1,1,1,1]. So the last three 0s are turned into 1s. The earlier 0s (first two, then the 0 at index3, and the 0 at index9) are left as 0s. But in the output, the 0 at index9 is 0. So why are the last three 0s replaced but not the others?\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the pattern is that in each row, starting from the end, you look for the first non-zero element, and then replace all 0s to the left of it (but not including those after the last non-zero). Wait, maybe not. Let's see.\n\nWait in Example 1's first input row: [0,0,2,0,9,6,5,5,5,0,2,1,0,0,0]. The last non-zero is 0,0,0? No, the last element is 0. Wait, the non-zero elements in that row are 2,9,6,5,5,5,0,2,1, followed by three 0s. The last non-zero in the row is 1 (at index 11). Then the three 0s after that (indices 12,13,14) would be replaced by 1s. But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after the last non-zero element in the row, any trailing 0s are left as 0s. Wait, but in Example 1's first row output, the last three 0s are replaced by 1s. So that contradicts that.\n\nHmm. This is getting confusing. Let's look for another pattern. Let's check if the output is replacing 0s with 1s except when the 0 is the first element in the row. But in Example 0's first input row, the first element is 9, so that's not the case. Example 1's first input row starts with 0, which remains 0 in output.\n\nWait in Example 0's first row, the output starts with 9. The input starts with 9. So the first element is unchanged. The next four 0s are replaced by 1s. Then after 2, there's 8, then a 0, which becomes 1, then 9, then 0 becomes 1, 2, 0 becomes 0, then 9. So the 0 at index11 is left as 0. What's special about that 0? Let's check the surrounding elements. In the input, before that 0 is 2, and after is 9. So it's between 2 and 9. But in the output, it's 0. So why is that 0 not replaced?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that if a 0 is between two non-zero numbers, it becomes 1. But in that case, the 0 at index11 is between 2 and 9, so should be replaced. But in the output, it's left as 0. Hmm, so that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are followed by a non-zero are replaced by 1, and those followed by 0 are left as 0 until the next non-zero. Let's test that. For Example 0's first input row:\n\nIndices: 0:9, 1:0, 2:0, 3:0,4:0,5:2,6:8,7:0,8:9,9:0,10:2,11:0,12:9.\n\nLooking at each 0:\n\nIndex1:0 followed by 0 (index2). So according to this idea, since it's followed by 0, but the next non-zero is at index5. So maybe all 0s from index1 to 4 are part of a run leading to 2. So those would be replaced by 1s. Then the 0 at index7 is followed by 9 (index8), so replaced by 1. The 0 at index9 is followed by 2 (index10), replaced by 1. The 0 at index11 is followed by 9 (index12), replaced by 1. But in the output, index11 is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that 0s are replaced by 1s unless they are the last element in the array. But in Example 0's first row, the last element is 9. So not a 0. So that's not it.\n\nWait maybe the rule is to replace all 0s with 1s except when a 0 is the first or last element in the row. But in Example 1's first input row, the first element is 0, and it remains 0 in the output. The last three 0s are replaced by 1s, so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe leading zeros are kept as 0, and trailing zeros are replaced by 1s. But in Example 0's first row, the zeros start at index1, which are replaced by 1s, and there's a trailing zero at index11 which is kept as 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output and see which 0s are kept as 0. For Example 0's first output, the only 0 in the output is at position11. The input at that position was 0. So perhaps the rule is that a 0 is kept if it's the only 0 between two non-zero numbers. But that 0 is between 2 and 9. So maybe if there's a single 0 between two non-zero numbers, it's kept, but runs of zeros are replaced with 1s. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's first input, the 0 at index11 is a single 0 between 2 and 9. So it's kept as 0. The runs of zeros (like four 0s from index1-4) are replaced by 1s. Similarly, the 0 at index7 is a single 0 between 8 and 9, but in the output, it's replaced by 1. So that contradicts this idea.\n\nWait, in Example0's input row, the 0 at index7 is between 8 and 9. In the output, that becomes 1. So the rule can't be that single zeros are kept. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any 0 that is not part of a contiguous block of zeros is replaced by 1. But that doesn't make sense. For example, the 0 at index9 in Example0's input is a single 0 between 9 and 2. In the output, it's replaced by 1, so that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's look at another example. Take Example2's input and output. Let's look at the first row of input and output again.\n\nInput: [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,0,0,6,0,5]\n\nOutput: [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,0,5]\n\nIn the input, after the 1s (indices8-10: 1,1,1), there are 0,0,6,0,5. The output replaces the two 0s (indices11,12) with 1s, keeps the 6, then 0 becomes 0, and 5. So the 0 at index14 (input) is kept as 0. But why?\n\nMaybe the rule is that after the first occurrence of a non-zero, all 0s are replaced by 1s except those at the end. Or perhaps, after the first non-zero in the row, all 0s are replaced with 1s except for trailing zeros. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 1s except when they are between two 0s. For example, in a run of zeros, the first and/or last are kept as 0, and the rest are replaced by 1. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's first input row, the four 0s (indices1-4) become 1s. So that's not the case. Similarly, in Example1's first input row, the last three 0s are replaced by 1s. So perhaps the rule is that all 0s are replaced by 1s except when the 0 is either the first element of the row or part of a trailing run of zeros. Wait, but in Example0's first input row, there's a trailing 0 at index11 which is kept as 0. So maybe trailing zeros are kept, but leading and middle zeros are replaced. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace all 0s with 1s except for the last 0 in each row. But in Example0's first row, the last 0 is at index11, which is kept as 0. In Example1's first row, the last three 0s are replaced by 1s except the last one? No, in Example1's output, the last three 0s are all replaced by 1s.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Perhaps the transformation is that for each row, starting from the left, every 0 is replaced by 1 until the first non-zero element is found. Then, after that, zeros are replaced by 1s again except for the last one. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a flood fill from the edges. Like, zeros that are reachable from the edges via other zeros are replaced by 1s, but enclosed zeros (surrounded by non-zeros) remain 0. But how to check that.\n\nLooking at Example0's first input row: [9,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,9,0,2,0,9]. If the 0s are surrounded by non-zeros, like the 0 at index11 (between 2 and 9), maybe that's enclosed. But the other 0s are part of a run leading to 2, so they are replaced. But how does that work.\n\nAlternatively, imagine the array as a grid (since each example has multiple rows). Wait, in the training examples, each input is a list of lists. Each row is a list. So perhaps the transformation is applied per row. So the pattern is within each row.\n\nLooking at Example0's first row again: the output replaces all 0s except the one at index11. Let's see the surrounding elements in the input. The 0 at index11 is between 2 and 9. The 2 is at index10, 0 at 11, and 9 at 12. So in the output, this 0 is kept. Maybe zeros that are isolated (single zeros between non-zero) are kept as 0, and runs of zeros are replaced by 1s. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0's first row, the four consecutive 0s (indices1-4) are replaced by 1s. The 0 at index7 is between 8 and 9, so single 0, replaced by 1. Wait, but in the output, it's replaced by 1. So that contradicts the idea. The 0 at index9 is between 9 and 2, single 0, replaced by 1. So the only 0 kept is the one at index11. So why is that one kept?\n\nWait, maybe if the 0 is between two identical numbers. For example, in Example0's row, the 0 at index11 is between 2 and 9. No. The 0 at index7 is between 8 and 9, which are different. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0 is kept if it's the middle element of an odd-length run. Like, in a run of 1 zero, it's kept. If run length is even, replace all with 1s. But in Example0's first input, the four zeros (run length 4) are replaced by 1s. The 0 at index7 (run length 1) is replaced by 1, so that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's look at another example. Take Example2's input first row:\n\nInput: [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,0,0,6,0,5]\n\nOutput: [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,0,5]\n\nSo the zeros at indices3,5,6 are kept as 0,0,0. Then the zeros at indices11,12 are replaced by 1s, and the zero at index14 is kept as 0. So why are the first three zeros kept and the latter replaced?\n\nMaybe the first three zeros are between non-zero numbers. Let's see: index3:0 is between 4 (index2) and 4 (index4). So it's between two 4s. So maybe zeros between same numbers are kept. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's first row, the 0 at index11 is between 2 and 9 (different numbers), but it's kept. So that contradicts this idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that when a zero is between two even numbers, it's kept, otherwise replaced. But 4 and 4 are even, but in Example0's row, the 0 at index7 is between 8 and 9 (even and odd), replaced by 1. The 0 at index11 is between 2 (even) and 9 (odd), but kept as 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to find a different approach. Maybe the pattern is that in each row, after the first non-zero element, all zeros are replaced by 1s until the end of the row. But no, because in Example0's first row, after the initial 9, the zeros are replaced by 1s, but later there's a 2, 8, 0 (replaced to 1), etc.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to replace all zeros with 1s except those that are at the start of the row. But in Example1's first row, the first two zeros are kept as 0s, but the third zero (index3) is replaced by 0 in output. Wait no, in Example1's first input row, the third element is 2, so zeros before that are kept. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first occurrence of non-zero in the row determines that all zeros after it are replaced by 1s except those that are trailing. For example, once the first non-zero is encountered, all subsequent zeros are replaced by 1s. But in Example0's first row, the first element is 9 (non-zero), so all zeros after that are replaced. But the output has a zero at index11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all zeros with 1s except for the zeros that are followed by a zero. So, if a zero is followed by another zero, it's replaced by 1. But if it's a single zero between non-zeros, it's kept. Wait, let's test this.\n\nIn Example0's first input row: the four zeros (indices1-4) are followed by 2. The first three zeros are followed by zero, the last one is followed by 2. So according to this rule, all of them are followed by zero or non-zero. But they are all replaced by 1s.\n\nThe 0 at index7 is followed by 9. So according to the rule, if a zero is followed by a non-zero, it's replaced by 1. But in the output, it is replaced by 1. The 0 at index9 is followed by 2 (non-zero), replaced by 1. The 0 at index11 is followed by 9 (non-zero), but in the output, it remains 0. So this contradicts the idea.\n\nWait, maybe it's the opposite: zeros that are followed by a non-zero are kept as 0, and those followed by zeros are replaced by 1. But in Example0's first row, the four zeros are followed by 2, so they would be kept. But they are replaced by 1s. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all zeros except the last occurrence in each row. But in Example0's first row, the last occurrence of zero is at index11. So it's kept. All others replaced. That seems to fit. Let's check.\n\nExample0's first row input has zeros at indices1-4,7,9,11. The last zero is at index11. So all other zeros are replaced by 1, which matches the output. \n\nLet's check another example. Example1's first row input has zeros at indices0,1,3,9,12-14. The last zero is at index14. But in the output, the zeros at indices12-14 are replaced by 1s, which contradicts this idea.\n\nHmm, no. Because the last zero in the input row is index14, but in the output, it's replaced by 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the last occurrence of zero in the entire array is kept. But that seems unlikely since each row is processed independently.\n\nWait, looking at Example2's first row input: [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,0,0,6,0,5]. The zeros are at indices3,5,6,11,12,14. The last zero is at index14. In the output, index14 is 0. But in the output, indices11,12 are replaced by 1s, while index14 is kept as 0. So maybe this idea holds: replace all zeros except the last occurrence in each row. So in Example0's first row, the last zero is index11, kept. Others replaced. In Example1's first row, the last zero is index14, which is replaced, so that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nSo this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the output and see if there's a pattern in the 1s. For example, in Example0's output, the 1s form contiguous regions. Maybe the transformation is to fill all regions of 0s with 1s except for the first and last 0 in each run. But again, need to verify.\n\nFor Example0's first row, the input has a run of four 0s (indices1-4). The output replaces all of them with 1s. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace all 0s with 1s except those that are adjacent to the same number. For example, if a 0 is between two identical numbers, it's kept as 0. Otherwise, replaced. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's first row, the 0 at index11 is between 2 and 9 (different numbers), but it's kept as 0. So that's not the case.\n\nIn Example2's first row input, the 0 at index3 is between 4 and 4. So kept as 0. The zeros at indices5 and 6 are between 4 and 6. So replaced by 0,0? But in the output, those zeros are kept as 0,0. Hmm.\n\nWait, input is [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,...]. So index3 is 0 between 4 and 4. So kept as 0. Then index5 and 6 are 0 and 0, between 4 and 6. So why are those zeros kept as 0 in the output? Because they are between 4 and 6. But according to the rule, they should be replaced. But in the output, they are kept as 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for another pattern. Let's see the difference between the input and output. For each element in the input, if it's 0, in the output it becomes 1 unless certain conditions are met. Let's see.\n\nLooking at Example0's output, the only 0 in the output is at the same position as the input's 0 at index11. So why that one? Let's check the surrounding elements in the input: input is ... 2, 0, 9. So 0 is between 2 and 9. In the output, it's kept as 0. Maybe if the 0 is between two numbers that are different, it's kept. But in Example0's row, the 0 at index7 is between 8 and 9 (different), but it's replaced by 1. So that can't be.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the rule is to replace 0s with 1s except when the 0 is the middle element of three consecutive zeros. But looking at Example0's first row, the four zeros are replaced by four 1s. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s are replaced by 1s except when they are part of a palindrome structure. Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by adding 1 to each 0, except when the sum would exceed 9. But that would make all 0s into 1s, which is not the case. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the 0s are replaced by 1s except when they are at certain positions, like even indices. But in Example0's first output row, the 0 is at index11 (odd), so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 0s are replaced by 1s except when the previous element is even. Let's check. In Example0's first row, the 0 at index11 comes after 2 (even). So maybe that's why it's kept as 0. But the 0 at index7 comes after 8 (even), but in the output, it's replaced by 1. So no.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's look for any other patterns.\n\nAnother observation: In all the output examples, the non-zero numbers remain the same as the input. Only the 0s are changed. So the rule is only about replacing certain 0s with 1s.\n\nLooking at the positions where 0s are kept as 0 in the output:\n\nIn Example0's first row: index11.\n\nIn Example1's first row: indices0,1,3,9.\n\nIn Example2's first row: indices3,5,6,14.\n\nWait, maybe the 0s that are followed by a non-zero are replaced by 1, and those followed by zero are left as 0. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0's first row:\n\n- index1:0 followed by 0 \u2192 left as 0. But output is 1. So no.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s except when the next element is 0. So if a 0 is followed by a 0, it's replaced by 0. Wait, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the 0s are replaced by 1s unless they are the start of a run of zeros that extends to the end of the row. But in Example1's first row, the last three zeros are replaced by 1s, so that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is to replace all 0s with 1s except the first occurrence in each row. But in Example0's first row, the first 0 is replaced by 1. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to replace all 0s except those that are at positions where the index is a prime number. For example, index11 is 11 (prime). In Example0's first output, the 0 is at index11. Let's check. Example1's first output has a 0 at index0 (not prime). So that's not it.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to see if there's a pattern in the positions where 0s are retained.\n\nLooking at Example0's first row output: the 0 is at position11 (counting from 0). 11 is 1+1=2, but not sure.\n\nIn Example1's first row input, the 0s retained are at indices0,1,3,9. Maybe even indices? No, 0 and 1 are even and odd. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the zeros are kept if they are in positions that are multiples of 3. Let's see:\n\nExample0's first row: position11 is 11, which is not a multiple of 3. So that's not.\n\nIn Example1's first row output, the zeros are at 0,1,3,9. 0 is 0, 1 is 1,3 is 3,9 is 9. 0,1,3,9: 0 is 0 mod 3, 1 is 1, 3 is 0, 9 is 0. So no pattern.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 0s that are kept are those where the sum of the preceding and succeeding elements is even. For Example0's first row, the 0 at index11 is between 2 and 9. 2+9=11 (odd), so no. But it's kept as 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the product of the preceding and succeeding elements is even. 2*9=18, even. But it's kept as 0. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for a different angle. Let's see the difference between input and output for each example.\n\nIn Example0's first row:\n\nInput: [9,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,9,0,2,0,9]\n\nOutput: [9,1,1,1,1,2,8,1,9,1,2,0,9]\n\nThe 0s replaced are all except the one at index11.\n\nIn Example1's first row:\n\nInput: [0,0,2,0,9,6,5,5,5,0,2,1,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [0,0,2,0,9,6,5,5,5,0,2,1,1,1,1]\n\nThe 0s kept are at indices0,1,3,9. The rest are replaced.\n\nIn Example2's first row:\n\nInput: [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,0,0,6,0,5]\n\nOutput: [7,4,4,0,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,0,5]\n\nThe 0s kept are at indices3,5,6,14.\n\nHmm. I notice that in Example0's first row output, the kept 0 is between 2 and 9. In Example2's first row, the kept 0 at index14 is between 6 and 5. So maybe the kept 0s are those where the sum of the surrounding numbers is a prime. 2+9=11 (prime), 6+5=11 (prime). In Example1's first row, the kept 0 at index3 is between 2 and 9. 2+9=11 (prime). The 0 at index9 is between 5 and 2. 5+2=7 (prime). The other kept 0s are at indices0 and 1, which are the start of the row, perhaps edge cases.\n\nThis seems possible. Let's check:\n\nFor Example0's first row, the 0 at index11 is between 2 and 9. Sum is 11 (prime), so kept as 0.\n\nThe 0 at index7 is between 8 and 9. Sum is 17 (prime). But in the output, it's replaced by 1. So this theory is invalid.\n\nHmm. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, if the product is a square. 2*9=18 (not a square). 8*9=72 (not a square).\n\nAnother idea: The 0s that are kept are those where both the preceding and succeeding numbers are even or both are odd. For Example0's index11: 2 (even), 9 (odd) \u2192 mixed, so kept. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the surrounding numbers are both even or both odd. For Example0's index11: 2 (even), 9 (odd) \u2192 no. But the 0 is kept. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of the problem in terms of the outputs. For example, in all the outputs, the 1s are clustered in certain regions. Maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 1s except those that are in certain positions relative to other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the distance from the nearest non-zero. For example, replace all zeros that are within a certain distance from a non-zero. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to replace all 0s except those that are part of a \"valley\" between two higher numbers. For example, if a 0 is between two numbers that are both higher than a certain value. But without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be that each 0 is replaced by 1 unless it is surrounded by numbers greater than 5. But checking Example0's first row, the 0 at index11 is between 2 and 9. 9 is greater than 5, 2 is not. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let's consider that the transformation is related to the number of non-zero elements in the row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each 0 is replaced by 1 unless it is the first or last element in the row, or it is between two non-zero elements. But in Example0's first row, the 0 at index11 is between two non-zero elements and is kept as 0. The 0 at index7 is between two non-zero elements but replaced by 1.\n\nHmm. Another idea: The 0s are replaced by 1s except when the sum of the indices of the 0s equals a certain number. But that seems too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing all 0s with 1s except when the 0 is the middle element of the array. But in Example0's first row, the middle element would be index6 (value 8), which is not a 0. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Let's count the number of 0s in the input and output. For Example0's first row input: 7 zeros. Output: 1 zero. So replaced 6 zeros.\n\nExample1's first row input: 9 zeros. Output: 4 zeros. So replaced 5 zeros.\n\nExample2's first row input: 6 zeros. Output: 4 zeros. So replaced 2 zeros.\n\nNo obvious pattern.\n\nPerhaps the rule is to replace all 0s except those that are adjacent to a 9. Let's check.\n\nExample0's first row: 0 at index11 is between 2 and 9. So adjacent to 9. Kept as 0. The 0 at index9 is between 9 and 2. Adjacent to 9. Replaced by 1. So that's not the case.\n\nExample2's first row: 0 at index14 is between 6 and 5. Not adjacent to 9. So why is it kept?\n\nThis line of thinking isn't helping.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 1s except those that are part of a palindrome structure. For example, if the 0 is in a position that mirrors a non-zero. But I can't see how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is related to the digits of the numbers around them. For example, sum of digits, etc.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to consider that perhaps the pattern is to replace all 0s with 1s except when a 0 is followed by a 0. But in Example0's first row, the four zeros are followed by each other, but they are replaced by 1s. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, replace all 0s except the last one in each contiguous block of zeros. For example, in a run of zeros, replace all except the last one. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0's first row: the four zeros are replaced by 1s. So this idea doesn't fit.\n\nIn Example1's first row: the last three zeros are replaced by 1s, so if it's the last one in the run, but they're all replaced. So no.\n\nWait, maybe the opposite: replace all zeros except the first one in each contiguous block. For example, in Example0's first row, the four zeros would have the first replaced and the rest as 0. But output replaces all to 1s.\n\nNo, that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, after trying various hypotheses and not finding a consistent pattern, I'm going to have to make a educated guess based on the examples. Looking at the outputs, the most common pattern seems to be that most 0s are replaced by 1s, but some are kept. The kept 0s often appear to be in positions where they are single zeros between non-zero numbers. For example, in Example0's first row, the 0 at index11 is a single zero between 2 and 9, and is kept. However, in Example0's first row, the 0 at index7 is a single zero between 8 and 9 but is replaced. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that a 0 is kept if it is between two even numbers. In Example0's first row, the 0 at index11 is between 2 (even) and 9 (odd), so not both even. But it's kept. So that's not.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the last element of each row in the output is the same as the input. For example, in Example0's first row, the last element is 9. In Example1's first row, the last element is 0 in input and 1 in output. Wait, no. The first row of Example1's input ends with three zeros, and the output ends with four 1s. So the last element is 1, which was 0 in input. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the first and last elements of each row are kept as in the input. But Example0's first row starts with 9 and ends with 9, which are kept. Example1's first row starts with 0 and ends with 0 in input. In the output, the first two elements are 0,0, and the last four are 1s. So the last element is changed. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. Another Idea: Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if they are not part of a sequence where the same number appears before and after. For example, if a 0 is between two identical numbers, it's kept; otherwise, replaced.\n\nIn Example0's first row, the 0 at index11 is between 2 and 9 (different), so replaced. But in the output, it's kept. So that's not.\n\nIn Example2's first row, the 0 at index3 is between 4 and 4, so kept. The zeros at 5 and 6 are between 4 and 6, so replaced. But in the output, they are kept as 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tough. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to make a best guess based on the examples. The most consistent pattern I can see is that all 0s are replaced with 1s except for the last 0 in each row. But in Example1's first row, the last 0 is replaced. So that's not it. Alternatively, the first 0 and the last 0 in each row are kept. But in Example0's first row, the first 0 is replaced.\n\nAnother possible pattern: Look at the output for the test input. The test input's first row is [0,0,0,8,0,5,0,0,9,0,6,0,0,0,0,5]. Let's try to apply a possible pattern and see what the output would be.\n\nAssuming that all 0s are replaced with 1s except those that are the first occurrence in the row. For example, first occurrence of 0 is kept as 0, others replaced. Let's see. The first row of test input has zeros at indices0,1,2,4,6,7,9,11,12,13,14. The first occurrence is index0. So replace all others with 1. Output would be [0,1,1,8,1,5,1,1,9,1,6,1,1,1,1,5]. But I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the last occurrence of 0 is kept. So in the test input's first row, the last 0 is at index14. So replace all others. The output would have 0 at index14 and others replaced. But looking at the training examples, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros that are surrounded by non-zeros are kept. For example, in the test input's first row: [0,0,0,8,0,5,0,0,9,0,6,0,0,0,0,5]. The zeros at index4 (between 8 and 5) would be surrounded by non-zeros, so kept. The zero at index9 is between 9 and 6, so surrounded by non-zeros. The zero at index11 is between 6 and 0. Not surrounded. The zeros at 0,1,2 are leading zeros. Maybe leading zeros are kept, zeros surrounded by non-zeros are kept, and others replaced.\n\nBut in Example0's first row, the leading zeros (indices1-4) are replaced, which would contradict this. So not sure.\n\nAt this point, given that I can't find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a educated guess based on the training examples. Looking at all the examples, it seems that most zeros are replaced by 1s, but some are left as 0. Perhaps the rule is that any zero that is the first zero in a group (left to right) is replaced by 1, and the rest are left as 0. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to replace all zeros with 1s except the zeros that are between two zeros. For example, if a zero is part of a group of zeros, only the middle ones are replaced. But in Example0's first row, all four zeros are replaced by 1s.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to proceed with the following pattern: replace all zeros with 1s except those that are the last zero in their respective runs. For example, in a run of zeros, only the last one is kept as 0. Let's see if this fits the examples.\n\nExample0's first input row: [9,0,0,0,0,2,...]. The run of four zeros would have the last one (index4) kept as 0. But the output shows all replaced by 1s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the first zero in each run is kept, others replaced. In Example0's first row, the run of four zeros would have the first kept as 0. But the output shows all replaced. So no.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the transformation is to replace all zeros except those that are at the end of the row. But in Example0's first row, the last zero is replaced. So no.\n\nGiven that I'm not making progress, I'll have to look for another approach. Perhaps the transformation is to replace all zeros with 1s except those that are in positions where the sum of their adjacent elements is even. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's first row, the 0 at index11 is between 2 and 9. 2+9=11 (odd). So it would be replaced. But it's kept. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, if the sum is even, then replace. 2+9=11 (odd), so kept as 0. So maybe this fits. Let's check another case.\n\nIn Example0's first row, the 0 at index7 is between 8 and 9. Sum is 17 (odd). So kept as 0. But in the output, it's replaced by 1. So no.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nAt this point, I think I'll have to proceed with the following approach: the pattern seems to replace all zeros with 1s except for those that are either the first or last element of the row. However, in Example0's first row, the first element is 9, so not zero. But in Example1's first row, the first element is 0 and is kept. The last element of Example1's first row is replaced. So this isn't consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to replace all zeros with 1s except those that are in positions where the index is even. But in Example0's first row, the 0 at index11 (odd) is kept. So that's not it.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to determine the exact pattern, I'll have to make a guess. Looking at the examples, it seems that most zeros are replaced by 1s, but some are left as 0. The ones left as 0 are often isolated between non-zero numbers. Perhaps the rule is that a 0 is replaced by 1 unless it is surrounded by non-zero numbers on both sides. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0's first row, the 0 at index11 is between 2 and 9 (non-zero), so it should be kept. The 0 at index7 is between 8 and 9 (non-zero), so it should be kept. But in the output, it's replaced by 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nIn Example2's first row, the 0 at index3 is between 4 and 4 (non-zero), so kept. The zeros at indices5 and 6 are between 4 and 6 (non-zero), so should be kept, but in the output, they are kept as 0. So this might fit. But why in Example0's first row, the 0 at index7 is replaced?\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time I've spent and the competition setting, I'll proceed with the following approach: replace all zeros with 1s except those that are followed by a 0. But in Example0's first row, this doesn't hold. Alternatively, the rule is to replace all zeros with 1s except those that are followed by a non-zero. But that would mean that trailing zeros are kept as 0, which isn't the case in Example1's first row.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The transformation is to replace all 0s with 1s except those that are at the same position as a 0 in the previous row. But since each row is processed independently, this is unlikely.\n\nFinally, given the time constraints, I'll proceed to assume that the pattern is to replace all zeros with 1s except those that are the last zero in the row. So in each row, the last zero is kept, others are replaced. \n\nTesting this:\n\nExample0's first row input has the last zero at index11. So output has 0 there. Others replaced by 1. Which matches the output.\n\nExample1's first row input has the last zero at index14. In the output, it's replaced by 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThus, this pattern is invalid.\n\nGiven that I can't determine the exact pattern, I'll have to take a different approach. Looking at the examples, the outputs seem to replace runs of zeros with 1s, leaving some isolated zeros. Perhaps the rule is to replace all zeros with 1s except when the zero is the only zero between two non-zero numbers, and those non-zero numbers are the same. For example, in Example2's first row, the zero at index3 is between 4 and 4, so kept. Other zeros are between different numbers and replaced. But in Example0's first row, the zero at index11 is between 2 and 9 (different), but kept. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll proceed with the following approach: All zeros are replaced with 1s except those that are the first occurrence of a zero in the row. But in Example0's first row, the first zero is replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm truly stuck. Given the examples, the most consistent pattern I can see is that most zeros are replaced with 1s, except those that are isolated between two non-zero numbers. But even that doesn't fit all cases. For the purpose of this competition, I'll proceed with that assumption and apply it to the test input.\n\nSo, for each row in the test input, replace all zeros with 1s except those that are between two non-zero numbers. If a zero is between two non-zero numbers, it remains 0. Otherwise, replaced with 1.\n\nLet's test this on Example0's first row:\n\nThe zeros at indices1-4 are in a run and not between two non-zero numbers. So replaced by 1s.\n\nThe zero at index7 is between 8 and 9 (non-zero), so kept. But in the output, it's replaced by 1. So this is wrong.\n\nThus, this assumption is incorrect.\n\nAfter extensive analysis without success, I'll have to conclude that the pattern is to replace all zeros with 1s except those that are at positions where the sum of their indices and some other factor equals a particular value. But without a clear pattern, I'll have to proceed with the following answer based on the examples, even if I can't discern the exact rule.\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that most zeros are replaced by 1s, but some remain 0. The Test Input's first row is [0,0,0,8,0,5,0,0,9,0,6,0,0,0,0,5]. Applying the pattern from the examples, the output would have most zeros replaced with 1s except possibly those between certain non-zero numbers. \n\nFor example, the first three zeros (indices0-2) may remain 0s if they are leading, but in Example1's first row, leading zeros were kept. Alternatively, they are replaced with 1s except the first one.\n\nBut given the confusion, I'll proceed to provide an output where all zeros are replaced with 1s except for certain ones, following the pattern observed in the training examples. Since I can't find the exact rule, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples provided.",
