        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these training examples where the input is a 3x3 grid (three rows of three elements each) and the output is a list of numbers. My job is to see how the input gets transformed into the output so I can apply the same logic to the test input.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n[0, 1, 0]\n\nOutput: [1, 1]\n\nHmm. Let me look at the input rows. The first row is all zeros. The second row has a 1 in the first position, and the third row has a 1 in the second position. The output is two 1s. Maybe the output is combining the non-zero elements from each row, but in some way. Wait, let's check other examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\n\nOutput: [2, 2, 2]\n\nHere, each row has a 2 in a different position. The output is three 2s. So maybe the output is the sum of all the non-zero elements? But in Example 0, there are two 1s, which sum to 2, but the output is [1,1], not [2]. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the non-zero elements from each row, but arranged in a particular way. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0] \u2192 no elements.\nRow 2: [1,0,0] \u2192 1.\nRow 3: [0,1,0] \u2192 1.\nSo output is [1,1], which matches the non-zero elements from rows 2 and 3. But then in Example 1:\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0] \u2192 2.\nRow 2: [2,0,0] \u2192 2.\nRow 3: [0,2,0] \u2192 2.\nSo output is [2,2,2], which is all three 2s. So that would make sense. So output is all non-zero elements from each row, but collected in order. Wait, but in Example 0, the first row has no non-zero elements, so output is from row 2 and 3. So that's 1 and 1, making [1,1].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n[0,7,0]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [7]\n\nOnly the first row has a 7, so output is [7]. That fits.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n[0,8,0]\n[8,8,0]\n[8,0,0]\n\nOutput: [8,8,8,8]\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: 0,8,0 \u2192 8.\nRow 2: 8,8,0 \u2192 two 8s.\nRow 3: 8,0,0 \u2192 8.\nSo combining these, it's 8 (from row1) + 8,8 (row2) +8 (row3) \u2192 [8,8,8,8]. But the output is [8,8,8,8], which would be the sum of the counts. Wait, but how does that fit? Let's check:\n\nWait in Example 3's output, it's four 8s. The rows have 1, 2, and 1 non-zero elements, which sum to 4. So the output is a list containing each non-zero element in order, row by row. So each row's non-zero elements are added to the output list in the order they appear in the row, and concatenated across rows.\n\nYes, that seems to fit all examples.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\nExample 0:\n\nRows:\n\nRow1: all zeros \u2192 nothing added.\nRow2: [1,0,0] \u2192 1 added.\nRow3: [0,1,0] \u2192 1 added.\nOutput: [1,1]. Correct.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow1: 2 \u2192 added.\nRow2: 2 \u2192 added.\nRow3: 2 \u2192 added.\nOutput [2,2,2]. Correct.\n\nExample2:\n\nOnly row1 has 7 \u2192 [7]. Correct.\n\nExample3:\n\nRow1: 8 \u2192 add.\nRow2: 8 and 8 \u2192 add both.\nRow3: 8 \u2192 add.\nTotal 4 eights. Correct.\n\nSo the pattern is: For each row in the input grid, collect all the non-zero elements in the order they appear, and concatenate all these into a single list. So the output is a list of all non-zero elements from each row, in order of rows, left to right.\n\nNow, applying this to the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[4,4,0]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,0,4]\n\nLet's process each row:\n\nFirst row: [4,4,0] \u2192 non-zero elements are 4 and 4. So add 4,4 to the output.\n\nSecond row: [4,0,4] \u2192 non-zero are 4 and 4. Add them.\n\nThird row: [0,0,4] \u2192 non-zero is 4. Add it.\n\nSo combining all, the output should be [4,4,4,4,4]. Wait, wait. Let's count:\n\nFirst row: 4,4 \u2192 two elements.\n\nSecond row: 4,4 \u2192 two elements.\n\nThird row: 4 \u2192 one element.\n\nTotal of 5 elements. But let me check the test input again:\n\nFirst row: [4,4,0] \u2192 elements at positions 0 and 1 are 4 and 4.\n\nSecond row: [4,0,4] \u2192 4 (position 0) and 4 (position 2).\n\nThird row: [0,0,4] \u2192 4 (position 2).\n\nSo the non-zero elements are:\n\n4,4 (from first row), then 4,4 (second row), then 4 (third row). So the output list would be [4,4,4,4,4]. But none of the examples have such a case, but according to the pattern, that's the case.\n\nBut wait, let me check the examples again. For instance, in Example3, the output is [8,8,8,8], which comes from 8 (row1), 8,8 (row2), 8 (row3). So that's 1+2+1=4 elements. So the output is all non-zero elements in order of rows, left to right.\n\nSo the Test Input's non-zero elements are:\n\nRow1: 4,4 \u2192 [4,4]\n\nRow2:4,4 \u2192 [4,4]\n\nRow3:4 \u2192 [4]\n\nSo combining, [4,4,4,4,4]. But let's check the training examples for possible other patterns. Wait, in Example0, the output is [1,1], which is the two 1s from rows 2 and 3. So the output is all non-zero elements from all rows, concatenated. So the test input would have 2+2+1=5 elements. But the expected output is [4,4,4,4,4], which is five elements. But when I look at the test input:\n\nFirst row: 4,4,0 \u2192 non-zero elements 4 and 4. So they are added as 4,4.\n\nSecond row: 4,0,4 \u2192 4,4.\n\nThird row: 0,0,4 \u2192 4.\n\nSo the output should be [4,4,4,4,4]. But let me check if there's any other pattern. For example, maybe considering columns instead of rows, but the examples don't support that. Example0's output is two 1s, which are from the second row (1 in first position) and third row (1 in second position). If I look at columns, column 0: 0,1,0 \u2192 sum 1. Column1:0,0,1 \u2192 sum 1. Column2:0,0,0. So sum [1,1], which matches the output. Wait, this is a different approach. Let me check this possibility.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0: [0,1,0] \u2192 sum is 1.\n\nColumn1: [0,0,1] \u2192 sum 1.\n\nColumn2: [0,0,0] \u2192 0.\n\nSo the output is [1,1], which matches the sums of columns 0 and 1. Then Example1:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0: [0,2,0] \u2192 2.\n\nColumn1: [2,0,2] \u2192 4.\n\nColumn2: [0,0,0] \u21920.\n\nWait, but the output is [2,2,2]. So this approach doesn't fit. So that idea is invalid.\n\nAlternative, perhaps the output is the sum of each column, but in Example1, that would be column0:0+2+0=2; column1:2+0+2=4; column2:0+0+0=0. Output would be [2,4], but the actual output is [2,2,2], which doesn't match. So that's not the pattern.\n\nSo back to the initial thought: output is all non-zero elements in order of rows, left to right, concatenated. Let's test the examples again with this.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow2 has [1,0,0] \u2192 1.\n\nRow3 has [0,1,0] \u21921.\n\nSo output [1,1]. Correct.\n\nExample1:\n\nEach row has a single 2, but in different positions. So each row contributes one 2. So output [2,2,2]. Correct.\n\nExample2:\n\nOnly row1 has a 7. So output [7]. Correct.\n\nExample3:\n\nRow1: [0,8,0] \u21928.\n\nRow2: [8,8,0] \u21928,8.\n\nRow3: [8,0,0] \u21928.\n\nSo output [8,8,8,8]. Correct.\n\nSo the pattern holds. Therefore, the test input should have all non-zero elements from each row, left to right, concatenated across rows.\n\nTest input:\n\nFirst row: [4,4,0] \u2192 4,4.\n\nSecond row: [4,0,4] \u21924,4.\n\nThird row: [0,0,4] \u21924.\n\nSo output list is [4,4,4,4,4]. But wait, the expected output from the examples would be [4,4,4,4,4], but let's check the format. The output examples have brackets like [1,1], etc. So the answer should be written in that format. So the answer is [4,4,4,4,4]. But wait, let me check the examples again. For instance, in Example3, the input rows have 8 in positions 1 (row1), 0 and 1 (row2), 0 (row3). The output is [8,8,8,8], which is 1+2+1=4 elements. So the order is left to right per row. So yes.\n\nSo for the test input, the output should be [4,4,4,4,4]. But wait, in the test input's second row, the elements are [4,0,4], which non-zero are 4 (first position) and 4 (third position). So in the order left to right, they are 4 and 4. So the output list is 4,4 (from first row), 4,4 (second row), 4 (third row), which gives five elements. So the output is [4,4,4,4,4].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to find a pattern in the given examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at each training example closely.\n\nExample 0:\nInput has three rows:\n[0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n[0, 1, 0]\nOutput is [1, 1]. Hmm. Let's see. Maybe the output is collecting non-zero elements from the input. Let's check the input rows. The second row has a 1, third row has a 1. But the output has two 1s. But the positions might matter. Wait, looking at the input, maybe it's looking for elements that are in the middle column? Because the second row's first element is 1, but the output is [1,1]. Wait, maybe the output is the sum of each column, but that doesn't fit. Example 0's columns would be [0+1+0=1, 0+0+1=1, 0+0+0=0], so output is [1,1], which matches. Let's check another example to see if that's the pattern.\n\nExample 1:\nInput rows:\n[0, 2, 0]\n[2, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0]\nColumns sums: 0+2+0=2, 2+0+2=4, 0+0+0=0. Output is [2,2,2]. Wait, that doesn't match. So the column sum idea is not correct here. So maybe not sum. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output [2,2,2]. The input has three rows. Each row has a 2 in a certain position. Let's see: the first row has 2 in the middle, the second row has 2 in the first position, third row has 2 in the middle again. The output has three 2s. Maybe each non-zero element in the input is listed in the output, but in a specific order. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input has non-zero elements: 1 (second row first), 1 (third row second). Output is [1,1]. That fits.\n\nExample1's input has three 2s in the first row middle, second row first, third row middle. So output has three 2s. But the output is [2,2,2], which matches the count.\n\nExample2's input has a 7 in the first row middle. Output is [7], which matches.\n\nExample3's input has 8 in first row middle, second row first and second, third row first. So four 8s. Output is [8,8,8,8]. So the pattern seems to be: collect all non-zero elements from the input matrix, in the order they appear row-wise, left to right, top to bottom. Wait, let's check:\n\nExample0: the non-zero elements are 1 (row2, column0) and 1 (row3, column1). So when reading row by row, left to right, the order would be row1: 0s; row2: 1,0,0 \u2192 1; row3:0,1,0 \u2192 1. So the output is [1,1]. That matches.\n\nExample1: non-zero elements are 2 (row1, col1), 2 (row2, col0), 2 (row3, col1). So order would be row1: 0,2,0 \u2192 2; row2:2,0,0 \u2192 2; row3:0,2,0 \u2192 2. So output is [2,2,2], which matches.\n\nExample3: row1 has 0,8,0 \u2192 8; row2:8,8,0 \u2192 8,8; row3:8,0,0 \u21928. So the non-zeros in order are 8,8,8,8. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern is to collect all non-zero elements in the order they appear row-wise, left to right, top to bottom, and list them in the output array.\n\nNow the test input is:\n\n[4,4,0]\n[4,0,4]\n[0,0,4]\n\nLet's collect the non-zero elements row-wise:\n\nFirst row: 4,4 \u2192 non-zero (since third element is 0)\nSecond row:4,0,4 \u2192 4 and 4\nThird row:0,0,4 \u21924\n\nSo the non-zero elements in order are 4,4,4,4,4. So the output should be [4,4,4,4,4].\n\nWait, let's count each row:\n\nRow 0: [4,4,0] \u2192 4 and 4. Two elements.\nRow1: [4,0,4] \u21924 and 4. Two elements.\nRow2: [0,0,4] \u21924. One element.\nTotal of 2+2+1=5 elements. So output array should have five 4s. So the answer would be [4,4,4,4,4].",
