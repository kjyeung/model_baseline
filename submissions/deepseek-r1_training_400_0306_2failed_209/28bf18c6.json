        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are these training examples where an 8x8 grid is transformed into a smaller grid, like 3x6 or something. Let me look at each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some 8s arranged in a certain way. The output has three rows. The first output row is [8,8,0,8,8,0], which is six elements. The second is [0,8,0,0,8,0], and the third is [8,8,8,8,8,8]. Hmm. How does the input relate to the output?\n\nLooking at the input grid for Example 0. The non-zero rows are rows 1, 2, and 3. Let's see:\n\nRow 1 (index 0-based? Maybe): [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 3: [0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, maybe the output is capturing the positions of the 8s in these rows but in a different arrangement. Let's look at the output rows. The first output row has 8s in positions 0,1,3,4. The second has 8s at positions 1 and 4. The third is all 8s except none zero. Maybe it's combining certain columns or rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row of the output is formed by combining two rows from the input. For example, taking two adjacent rows and interleaving their non-zero elements? Or perhaps summing or merging in some way.\n\nAnother approach: the output has three rows, which might correspond to the three non-zero rows in the input. But the input has three non-zero rows (rows 1,2,3?), and the output has three rows. Let's see:\n\nInput rows (original example 0's input):\n\nRow 1: 0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 2:0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow3:0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0\n\nSo perhaps each output row is combining elements from two input rows. Let's look at the first output row [8,8,0,8,8,0]. It's six elements. The input rows are eight elements. Maybe the output is compressing two adjacent rows into one, taking every other element? Let's see.\n\nFor example, if we take rows 1 and 2 (the first two non-zero rows), and interleave their elements. But row 1 is [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0], row 2 is [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. If we interleave columns, maybe taking columns 1,2,3 from both rows and combining? Or maybe looking for positions where either row has a non-zero value. Alternatively, adding them? Let's see:\n\nRow1 and Row2. Let's take columns 1 to 6 (since original input is 8 columns, output is 6). Maybe each output row is formed by combining pairs of columns from the input rows. For example, the first output row could be combining the non-zero elements from rows 1 and 3, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the non-zero elements from each column. For example, in Example 0's input, columns that have 8s are columns 1,2,3. Let's check:\n\nLooking at each column in input:\n\nColumn 0: all zeros except row 1 and 3? Wait, row indices are 0-based?\n\nWait, input is 8 rows. Let's index them as 0-7.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRows 4-7 are all zeros.\n\nSo columns:\n\nFor column 1 (second element in each row):\n\nRow 1:8, row2:0, row3:8. Other rows 0.\n\nSimilarly, column 2: row1:8, row2:8, row3:8.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is a transformation where each column in the input becomes a row in the output, but only for columns that have non-zero values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking each non-zero cell and arranging them into the output in a certain order.\n\nAnother observation: in the first example's output, the three rows each have 6 elements. Let's see:\n\nExample0's output has 3 rows of 6 elements. Example1's output is the same structure. So maybe each output row is formed by two input rows, perhaps concatenating two input rows, but trimmed or modified.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the output rows are shorter than the input, maybe the transformation is taking a portion of the input and rotating it.\n\nWait, in Example0's input, the non-zero elements form a kind of shape. Let me sketch it out:\n\nRow1: 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow2: 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow3: 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n\nIf we look at the positions of 8s, maybe the output is capturing the perimeter of this shape. But the output in Example0 is three rows:\n\n[8,8,0,8,8,0]\n\n[0,8,0,0,8,0]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the output is stacking the non-zero rows, but modified. For example, each output row could be combining two rows from the input, perhaps taking the non-zero elements.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output for Example0, the first row has 8,8,0,8,8,0. Let's see if that's similar to the first and third rows of the input. For example, row1 of input (after leading zeros) is 8,8,0. Row3 has 8,8,8. Maybe combining them in some way. But the output rows are longer. Maybe it's taking the non-zero parts of each row and interleaving them?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is a combination of three input rows. Let's see. The output has three rows, and the input has three non-zero rows. Maybe each output row is derived from each input row, but transformed. For example, in Example0, input row1 is [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Output row1 is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. If we take the non-zero parts (8,8) and then from row3 (8,8,8), perhaps combining them with some padding.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as the transpose of certain parts. For instance, taking the non-zero columns and transposing them. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0's input, the non-zero columns are columns 1,2,3. Let's extract those columns:\n\nRow1:8,8,0\n\nRow2:0,8,0\n\nRow3:8,8,8\n\nTransposing these would give:\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[0,0,8]\n\nBut that doesn't match the output. Hmm. The output's first row is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Maybe the output is combining these columns in a different way. For example, each output row is a combination of two adjacent input rows. Like merging row1 and row3, but not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example1's input and output. The input has non-zero elements in rows 5,6,7. The output is three rows. For example, the first output row is [0,2,0,0,2,0]. The second is [2,2,2,2,2,2], the third is [2,2,0,2,2,0]. The input rows:\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the non-zero elements are in columns 3 (row5), columns 2-4 (row6), and columns 2-3 (row7). The output rows again have 6 elements. How are these transformed?\n\nLooking at the output rows for Example1:\n\nFirst output row: 0,2,0,0,2,0. Maybe this corresponds to row5's 2 in column3. Then row7 has 2 in column3. So 0,2 (from row5 column3?), then 0,0,2,0 (from row7 column3?) Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows might be formed by taking the vertical slices. For instance, in Example0, the 8s are in columns 1,2,3. Maybe each output row is a combination of the values in these columns across three rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a compressed version where each element in the output is derived from a 2x2 block in the input. But 8x8 input would become 4x4, but the output is 3x6. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the output for each example is 3 rows of 6 elements. So 3x6. Let's see: 8x8 input to 3x6 output. How? Maybe each output row is formed by combining two rows of the input, perhaps concatenating certain columns.\n\nWait, in Example0, the three non-zero input rows are rows 1,2,3. The output has three rows. So maybe each output row corresponds to each input row. But the output rows have six elements. Let's see:\n\nInput row1 (0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0). Maybe the output row1 is combining columns 1 and 2 (8,8) with something else. But the output row1 is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. That's six elements. Maybe the first three elements come from row1, the next three from row3? Or perhaps it's interleaving two rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is made by taking two input rows and interleaving their elements. For example, row1 and row3 of the input. Let's see:\n\nRow1: 0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow3:0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0\n\nIf we take elements 1-6 from each row (assuming we ignore the first and last element, maybe?), then interleave them. But that's 6 elements per row. So for row1, elements 1-6: 8,8,0,0,0,0. For row3: 8,8,8,0,0,0. Interleave them? Like take row1's first three and row3's first three, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the non-zero columns and merging them. For example, in Example0, columns 1,2,3 have 8s. So perhaps each output row is made by taking those columns, but how? Let's see:\n\nFor row1: columns1-3 are 8,8,0\n\nRow2:0,8,0\n\nRow3:8,8,8\n\nIf we stack them horizontally, it would be 3 rows of 3 elements. But the output is 3 rows of 6. So maybe combining two rows side by side. For example, row1 and row3's columns 1-3. So 8,8,0 from row1 and 8,8,8 from row3, making [8,8,0,8,8,8]. But the first output row is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, the first output row is 8,8,0,8,8,0. So maybe row1 and row3's columns 1-3, but row3's third element is 8. So maybe not that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking each non-zero row and mirroring it. For example, row1 is [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. If we take the non-zero part (8,8) and mirror it to make 8,8,0,8,8. But that gives 5 elements. Hmm.\n\nWait, the output rows have 6 elements. Let's think of each output row as being made by taking the non-zero parts of two input rows and combining them. For example, in Example0's output, the first row could be the non-zero parts of row1 (8,8) and row3 (8,8,8), but how to get 6 elements. Maybe padding with zeros. For instance, 8,8,0 (from row1) and 8,8,0 (from row3?), but not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the sum of each output row. In Example0's first output row, sum is 8+8+8+8=32. But the input rows sum to 16, 8, and 24. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a convolution or some kind of neighbor count. But the outputs have the same numbers as the input, so perhaps it's not a count but a direct transformation.\n\nLooking at Example2's input and output. The input has non-zero elements in rows 1,2,3. Let's see:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nThe output is three rows:\n\n[0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\n[1,0,0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0,0,1,0]\n\nHmm. The first output row has 0,1,1 followed by 0,1,1. Which might correspond to the non-zero elements in row1 (1,1) and row3 (1). But how?\n\nWait, row1 has 1s at positions 5 and 6 (0-based). Row3 has a 1 at position 5. So maybe combining these. But the output row is [0,1,1,0,1,1]. That's six elements. Maybe each output row is a combination of two input rows, but for each position, take the value if either row has a non-zero. For example, row1 and row3:\n\nPositions 5 and 6 in row1: 1,1. Positions in row3, same columns: 1,0. So combining them as 1,1,0 and 1,0,0, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows could be the first three rows of the input, but each split into two parts. For example, taking the first four elements and the last four elements, but again not matching.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is a rotation of certain parts. For example, the input's non-zero region is rotated 90 degrees. Let's try for Example0. The non-zero region is in rows 1-3, columns 1-3.\n\nOriginal:\n\nRow1: 0 8 8 0 ...\n\nRow2:0 0 8 0 ...\n\nRow3:0 8 8 8 ...\n\nIf rotated 90 degrees clockwise, this would become:\n\nCol1: 0 0 0 \u2192 rotated as row3: 0 0 0 (no, but original columns might be different). Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the transpose of the non-zero area. The non-zero area is 3x3 (rows 1-3, cols 1-3). Transposing that would give:\n\nRow1: 0 0 0\n\nRow2:8 0 8\n\nRow3:8 8 8\n\nBut the output's first row in Example0 is [8,8,0,8,8,0], which is six elements. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by concatenating two adjacent columns from the input. For example, in Example0, columns 1 and 2 in the input rows:\n\nRow1: 8,8\n\nRow2:0,8\n\nRow3:8,8\n\nConcatenated would give 8,8,0,8,8,8. But the output's first row is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe looking for the pattern in the output arrangement. For example, in Example0's output:\n\nFirst row: 8,8,0,8,8,0\n\nSecond row:0,8,0,0,8,0\n\nThird row: all 8s.\n\nWait, the third row is all 8s. In the input, the third row (row3) is 0,8,8,8,0... So perhaps the third output row is combining the non-zero elements from multiple rows. Like if there's a 8 in any of the rows for a particular column, then set to 8. But that would create a row of 8s for columns that have any 8s. In example0's input columns 1,2,3 have 8s. So third output row is all 8s in the first three columns? But no, the third output row is 6 elements, all 8s. So maybe it's considering a certain width.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking each non-zero input row and creating two output rows by splitting into two parts. For example, row1 in input is [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Split into two parts: [0,8,8,0] and [0,0,0,0], but that's not leading to the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is a combination of the cells from the input in a diagonal or cross pattern. For example, in Example0, the first output row might correspond to the top parts of the shape, the middle row to the center, etc.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the outline of the shape in the input. For example, in Example0, the 8s form a kind of T-shape. The output might be capturing the perimeter. But how that translates to the output rows is unclear.\n\nAnother observation: the number of output rows is equal to the number of non-zero rows in the input. For example, in Example0, there are three non-zero rows (rows 1,2,3), and the output has three rows. In Example1, the input has three non-zero rows (rows5,6,7), and output has three rows. Similarly, Example2 has three non-zero rows (rows1,2,3), output three rows. So the pattern might be that each output row corresponds to a non-zero input row, but transformed.\n\nSo, for each non-zero input row, generate an output row. How?\n\nLooking at Example0's input row1: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 output row1 is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Let's see. The input row has 8s at positions1 and 2. The output row has 8s at 0,1,3,4. Maybe the output row is taking the non-zero elements from the input row and mirroring them. So 8,8 becomes 8,8,0,8,8. But that's five elements, but the output row has six. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each non-zero input row, the output row is created by taking the non-zero elements and their positions, then reflecting them. For example, input row1 has 8s at positions1 and2. The output row1 has 8s at positions0,1,3,4. Which is like mirroring them around a certain point. For example, if the original is positions1 and2 (0-based), mirroring them across the center of the row. But input row is length8, output is length6. Maybe padding with zeros on both ends.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is formed by taking the input row's non-zero elements and creating a symmetric pattern. For example, row1 has 8,8. Output row is 8,8,0,8,8,0. Which is like 8,8 followed by 0 and then mirrored as 8,8,0. But that gives 6 elements. Wait, 8,8,0,8,8,0. It's like two copies of 8,8,0 but the last element is cut off. Alternatively, it's taking the non-zero part (8,8) and placing it on both ends with a zero in the middle. Like 8,8,0 in the first half and 8,8,0 in the second. But that would make six elements. Let me see: first three elements are 8,8,0, next three are 8,8,0. So the output row1 would be [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Which matches Example0's first output row. Similarly, row2's input is [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. The non-zero is at position2. The output row2 is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. So it's 0,8,0 in the first half and 0,8,0 in the second. Which is like placing the non-zero element mirrored. But how?\n\nWait, input row2 has a single 8 at position2. The output row is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. So each half (first three elements and next three) has a 8 at position1. Which is like mirroring the non-zero element. Similarly, input row3 is [0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]. The output row3 is [8,8,8,8,8,8]. Which is all 8s. So that would imply that the output row is taking the non-zero elements from the input row and mirroring them to fill both halves of the output row.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\nFor each non-zero input row, take the non-zero elements and create a mirrored version in the output row, splitting it into two parts. Each part is the non-zero elements padded with zeros to form three elements, then mirrored.\n\nFor example, in input row1 (0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0), the non-zero part is 8,8. Split into three elements: 8,8,0. Then mirror it to get 8,8,0 followed by 8,8,0 \u2192 total six elements. Which matches Example0's first output row.\n\nInput row2 (0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0): non-zero is 8 at position2. Split into three elements: 0,8,0. Mirrored: 0,8,0,0,8,0. Which matches Example0's second output row.\n\nInput row3 (0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0): non-zero is 8,8,8. Split into three elements: 8,8,8. Mirrored: 8,8,8,8,8,8. Which matches the third output row.\n\nApplying this to Example1:\n\nInput row5 (0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0): non-zero at position3 \u2192 split into 0,0,2 \u2192 mirror \u2192 0,0,2,0,0,2 \u2192 but the first output row is [0,2,0,0,2,0]. Wait, that's different.\n\nWait, maybe the split is different. For row5 in Example1, the non-zero is at position3. If we take the three elements around it. For example, positions2,3,4: 0,2,0. Split into three elements: 0,2,0. Mirror \u2192 0,2,0,0,2,0. Which matches the first output row of Example1.\n\nThen row6 (0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0): non-zero elements 2,2,2 at positions2-4. Split into three elements: 2,2,2. Mirror \u2192 2,2,2,2,2,2. Which matches the second output row.\n\nRow7 (0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0): non-zero at positions2,3. Split into three elements: 2,2,0. Mirror \u2192 2,2,0,2,2,0. Which matches the third output row.\n\nYes! This seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, for Example2:\n\nInput row1: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0] \u2192 non-zero at positions5,6. Split into three elements: 0,1,1. Mirror \u2192 0,1,1,0,1,1. Which is the first output row.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zero at position4. Split into three elements: 1,0,0 (positions3,4,5? Or maybe centered around the non-zero). Wait, perhaps the split is taking the non-zero element and the two adjacent positions. For example, if the non-zero is in position5, the three elements would be positions4,5,6. But in Example2's row2, the non-zero is at position4 (0-based). So positions3,4,5 would be 0,1,0. Split into three elements: 0,1,0. Mirror \u2192 0,1,0,0,1,0. But the output's second row is [1,0,0,1,0,0]. Wait, that doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's recheck Example2.\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0] \u2192 non-zero at positions5 and6. So the three elements around this would be positions4,5,6 \u2192 0,1,1. Split into three elements \u2192 0,1,1. Mirrored \u2192 0,1,1,0,1,1. Which matches output row1.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zero at position4. So three elements positions3,4,5 \u2192 0,1,0. Mirrored \u2192 0,1,0,0,1,0. But the output's second row is [1,0,0,1,0,0]. Hmm, discrepancy. So maybe the split is not around the non-zero elements but taking the leftmost non-zero and then three elements.\n\nWait, maybe for each row, we take the first three non-zero elements and pad with zeros to make three elements. But in Example2's row2, the non-zero is at position4, but how to split into three elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the split is done such that the non-zero elements are centered. For example, for a single non-zero element, take it and the adjacent elements. For two non-zero elements, take them and adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each input row, we take the first three elements after the first non-zero element. Or maybe the split is based on the entire row, not centered on the non-zero elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the split is taking the first three elements of the row where the non-zero elements start, and then taking three elements. For example, in Example0's row1, the non-zero starts at position1. So take elements1-3 (8,8,0). Then mirror it. For Example0's row2, non-zero starts at position2. Take elements2-4 (8,0,0). But that gives 8,0,0, mirrored would be 8,0,0,8,0,0. Which doesn't match the output.\n\nHmm. Maybe this approach isn't correct. Let's look at Example2's second input row: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. The non-zero is at position4. The output row2 is [1,0,0,1,0,0]. How to get this from the input row.\n\nIf the output row is made by taking the three elements starting from the first non-zero, then mirroring.\n\nInput row2's first non-zero is at position4. Take elements4-6: 1,0,0. Mirror \u2192 1,0,0,1,0,0. Which matches the output. Similarly, in row3 of Example2's input: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. First non-zero at position5. Take elements5-7:1,0,0. Mirror \u21921,0,0,1,0,0. But the output row3 is [0,1,0,0,1,0]. Wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's the three elements before and after the first non-zero?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the split is that for each input row, we take the three elements starting from the first non-zero element's position. So in Example2's row2: first non-zero at position4, take elements4-6:1,0,0. Mirror \u21921,0,0,1,0,0. Which matches the output row2.\n\nFor Example2's row3: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. First non-zero at position5. Take elements5-7:1,0,0. Mirror \u21921,0,0,1,0,0. But the output row3 is [0,1,0,0,1,0]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, Example2's output row3 is [0,1,0,0,1,0]. Maybe the input row3 is being split differently. Input row3: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. The first non-zero is at position5. Take elements5-7:1,0,0. Mirror gives 1,0,0,1,0,0. But output is [0,1,0,0,1,0]. So this approach doesn't work. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe the split is into two parts. For each input row, split into two halves (first four and next four elements), then for each half, take the first three elements. Then mirror each half.\n\nFor example, in Example0's row1: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Split into [0,8,8,0] and [0,0,0,0]. Take the first three of each: [0,8,8] and [0,0,0]. Mirror each \u2192 [8,8,0] and [0,0,0], then combine \u2192 [8,8,0,0,0,0]. But the output is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, take the first three elements of each half. For row1, first half: 0,8,8. Second half:0,0,0. So mirrored for each half: 8,8,0 and 0,0,0 \u2192 combined as [8,8,0,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's re-examine Example2's row3. Input row3 has [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. Output row3 is [0,1,0,0,1,0]. How to get that from the input row.\n\nIf the split is the three elements centered on the non-zero. The non-zero is at position5. Take positions4,5,6: 0,1,0. Mirror \u2192 0,1,0,0,1,0. Which matches the output row3. Ah! So perhaps for each input row, take the three elements centered around the first non-zero element. Then mirror them to form six elements.\n\nWait, let's test this for all examples.\n\nExample0's row1: first non-zero at position1. Take positions0,1,2 \u2192 0,8,8. But centered would be positions0,1,2. Mirror \u2192 8,8,0,8,8,0? Wait, no. Wait, the three elements would be positions0,1,2: 0,8,8. Mirroring this would give 8,8,0. So combining the original and mirrored: 0,8,8 followed by 8,8,0 \u2192 [0,8,8,8,8,0]. But the output row1 is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the three elements are the first non-zero and the next two. For Example0's row1, non-zero starts at position1. Take positions1,2,3 \u21928,8,0. Mirror \u21928,8,0 \u2192 combined with mirrored \u21928,8,0,8,8,0. Which matches the output row1. Yes! So the pattern is:\n\nFor each non-zero input row, take the three elements starting from the position of the first non-zero element. Then concatenate this triplet with its mirror (reversed) to form a six-element output row.\n\nWait, no. Because mirroring [8,8,0] would reverse it to [0,8,8]. So if you take the triplet and then its mirror, you get [8,8,0,0,8,8]. Which is not the output.\n\nWait, but in Example0's row1, the output is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. So the first three elements are [8,8,0], and the next three are [8,8,0]. That's the same as repeating the triplet. So perhaps the output row is the triplet followed by itself. For example, the triplet is 8,8,0. Repeat \u2192 8,8,0,8,8,0. Which matches the first output row.\n\nSimilarly, for Example0's row2: input is [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. The first non-zero is at position2. Take positions2,3,4 \u21928,0,0. Repeat \u21928,0,0,8,0,0. But the output row2 is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. So this approach doesn't fit.\n\nWait, this discrepancy suggests another approach. Maybe the triplet is the three elements starting from the first non-zero element. For row1 of Example0: first non-zero at position1 \u2192 elements1,2,3:8,8,0. Output is this followed by the same triplet \u2192 [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Which matches. For row2 of Example0: first non-zero at position2 \u2192 elements2,3,4:8,0,0. Repeat \u2192 [8,0,0,8,0,0]. But the output row2 is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. So not matching.\n\nHmm, so this doesn't work. Let's look at row2 of Example0's input. The first non-zero is at position2. The triplet is elements2,3,4:8,0,0. But the output row is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. This suggests that the triplet is different. Maybe it's elements1,2,3:0,8,0. Then repeat \u2192 0,8,0,0,8,0. Which matches. So how to get that triplet.\n\nAh, perhaps the triplet is the three elements around the first non-zero element. For example, the first non-zero in row2 is at position2. The triplet is elements1,2,3 \u21920,8,0. Then repeat \u21920,8,0,0,8,0. Which matches the output row2. Similarly, for row3 of Example0: first non-zero at position1. Elements1,2,3 \u21928,8,8. Repeat \u21928,8,8,8,8,8. Which matches the output row3.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each non-zero input row, take the three elements starting from the position before the first non-zero. So triplet is (first_non_zero-1, first_non_zero, first_non_zero+1). But for example, if the first non-zero is at position1 (as in row1 of Example0), then triplet is positions0,1,2 \u21920,8,8. Repeat \u21920,8,8,0,8,8. But output row1 is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the triplet is first_non_zero, first_non_zero+1, first_non_zero+2. For row1, first_non_zero is at1. So positions1,2,3 \u21928,8,0. Repeat \u21928,8,0,8,8,0. Which matches.\n\nFor row2 of Example0: first_non_zero is at2. So positions2,3,4 \u21928,0,0. Repeat \u21928,0,0,8,0,0. But output row2 is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. So this doesn't fit. So there's a problem here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triplet is the first three consecutive non-zero elements in the row. For example, row1 of Example0 has 8,8,0. So take 8,8,0 and repeat. Which matches. Row2 of Example0 has 8,0,0. So triplet is 8,0,0. Repeat \u21928,0,0,8,0,0. But output row2 is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nSo this approach is not working. Let's think again.\n\nAlternative approach: for each non-zero row in the input, the output row is formed by taking the first three non-zero elements (or zero if none) and then the same triplet again, but reversed. For example, in Example0's row1: triplet is8,8,0. Reverse \u21920,8,8. So output is 8,8,0,0,8,8. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, first triplet is the non-zero elements padded with zeros to three, then mirrored. For row1 of Example0: 8,8 \u2192 8,8,0. Then mirror to get 0,8,8. So combined \u21928,8,0,0,8,8. Not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me try to think of the output rows as being made by taking the original row's elements and expanding them into six elements by duplicating each element. For example, each element in the input row is duplicated. But for Example0's row1: input elements are 0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0. If we duplicate each element, it becomes 00 88 88 00 00 00 00 00 \u2192 but that's 16 elements, which is longer than the output's 6.\n\nAlternatively, take every other element and duplicate. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: the output rows in Example0 are each a combination of the input's row1 and row3. For instance, output row1 is row1's non-zero elements followed by row3's non-zero elements. But this doesn't fit the other examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by taking the non-zero elements from each input row and placing them in the output row in a mirrored fashion, with zeros in between.\n\nFor Example0's row1: 8,8. Output row1:8,8,0,8,8,0. So placing 8,8 at the start and then again with a zero in between. Not sure.\n\nLet's look at the test input. The test input is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo the non-zero rows are rows4,5,6 (0-based?), which are:\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nFollowing the pattern we need to apply.\n\nAccording to the previous pattern we thought of, each output row is formed by taking the three elements starting from the first non-zero element's position in the input row, then repeating that triplet.\n\nFor row4: first non-zero is at position3. So triplet is elements3,4,5:3,0,0. Output row would be 3,0,0,3,0,0.\n\nRow5: first non-zero is at position1. Triplet elements1,2,3:3,3,3. Output row: 3,3,3,3,3,3.\n\nRow6: first non-zero is at position1. Triplet elements1,2,3:3,0,0. Output row:3,0,0,3,0,0.\n\nBut what's the expected output based on the examples?\n\nLooking at the training examples, each output row is three rows. For the test input, the expected output would be three rows, each six elements.\n\nBut let's see what the expected output would be based on the pattern:\n\nRow4's triplet is3,0,0 \u2192 output row1:3,0,0,3,0,0.\n\nRow5's triplet is3,3,3 \u2192 output row2:3,3,3,3,3,3.\n\nRow6's triplet is3,0,0 \u2192 output row3:3,0,0,3,0,0.\n\nBut looking at Example1's output:\n\nInput row5's triplet (elements3-5):2,0,0 \u2192 output row1 is [0,2,0,0,2,0], which is not the same as repeating the triplet. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nWait, in Example1's row5 (input row5: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]), first non-zero at position3. Triplet is elements3,4,5:2,0,0. If we mirror this triplet (reverse), we get0,0,2. Then the output row is [0,0,2,0,0,2]. But the actual output row1 in Example1 is [0,2,0,0,2,0]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, for each input row, the output row is made by taking the triplet around the first non-zero (positions first_non_zero-1, first_non_zero, first_non_zero+1). For example, in Example1's row5, first_non_zero is at3. So triplet is elements2,3,4:0,2,0. Mirror \u21920,2,0,0,2,0. Which matches the output row1.\n\nSimilarly, for Example0's row2: first_non_zero at2. Triplet is elements1,2,3:0,8,0. Mirror \u21920,8,0,0,8,0. Which matches the output row2.\n\nAh! This seems to fit. So the pattern is:\n\nFor each non-zero input row, take the three elements centered around the first non-zero element. This triplet consists of the first non-zero element and the elements immediately before and after it. Then, mirror this triplet (append the reversed triplet) to form a six-element output row.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's row1: first non-zero at1. Triplet is elements0,1,2:0,8,8 \u2192 mirror (reverse triplet) \u21928,8,0. So output row is triplet + mirrored triplet:0,8,8,8,8,0. But the actual output row is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the triplet of elements centered on the first non-zero. For example, first non-zero at position1. Centered triplet would be elements0,1,2 \u21920,8,8. Then mirrored triplet is elements2,1,0 \u21928,8,0. So output row would be 0,8,8,8,8,0. But the actual output row is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triplet is the first non-zero element and the next two elements. For Example0's row1: elements1,2,3:8,8,0. Then mirror is0,8,8. So output row:8,8,0,0,8,8. Which doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, the triplet is the first non-zero and the two elements after. For row1 of Example0:8,8,0. Output row is this triplet followed by the same triplet \u21928,8,0,8,8,0. Which matches. For row2 of Example0: first non-zero at2. Triplet is8,0,0. Output row would be8,0,0,8,0,0. But actual output row2 is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. So not matching.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's re-examine the examples with the hypothesis that the output row is formed by taking the three elements around the first non-zero (first_non_zero-1, first_non_zero, first_non_zero+1), then appending the reverse of this triplet.\n\nFor Example0's row1: first_non_zero at1. Triplet is elements0,1,2:0,8,8. Reverse is8,8,0. Output row:0,8,8,8,8,0. Not matching.\n\nExample0's row2: first_non_zero at2. Triplet is1,2,3:0,8,0. Reverse is0,8,0. Output row:0,8,0,0,8,0. Which matches.\n\nExample0's row3: first_non_zero at1. Triplet0,1,2:0,8,8. Reverse8,8,0. Output row0,8,8,8,8,0. But the actual row3's output is all 8s. So this doesn't work.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps for each input row, the output row is formed by taking the first three elements after the first non-zero element, padding with zeros if necessary, then repeating them.\n\nExample0's row1: first non-zero at1. Elements1,2,3:8,8,0 \u2192 output row:8,8,0,8,8,0. Which matches.\n\nExample0's row2: first non-zero at2. Elements2,3,4:8,0,0 \u2192 output row:8,0,0,8,0,0. Doesn't match actual output [0,8,0,0,8,0].\n\nHmm. This approach works for row1 and row3 but not row2.\n\nBut looking back at Example0's row2 input: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. The first non-zero is at2. Elements2,3,4 are8,0,0. The output row is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. How is this derived?\n\nWait, maybe the output row is formed by taking the elements from the first non-zero to the next two elements, but in a way that includes the elements before and after. For example, for row2 of Example0, the first non-zero is at position2. Take elements1,2,3:0,8,0 \u2192 output row is 0,8,0,0,8,0. Which matches. So the triplet is elements (first_non_zero-1, first_non_zero, first_non_zero+1). Then the output is this triplet followed by the same triplet.\n\nYes! This fits all examples.\n\nLet's verify:\n\nExample0's row1: first_non_zero at1. Triplet elements0,1,2:0,8,8. Output row is triplet + triplet \u21920,8,8,0,8,8. But the actual output row is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. So no.\n\nWait, maybe it's not the same triplet twice. Maybe it's the triplet followed by its reverse.\n\nExample0's row1: triplet0,1,2:0,8,8 \u2192 reverse is8,8,0. So output row:0,8,8 + 8,8,0 \u2192 0,8,8,8,8,0. Actual output is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: the triplet is (first_non_zero, first_non_zero+1, first_non_zero+2). For Example0's row1: elements1,2,3 \u21928,8,0. Output row:8,8,0,8,8,0 \u2192 triplet + triplet. Which matches.\n\nFor row2 of Example0: first_non_zero at2. Elements2,3,4:8,0,0 \u2192 output row:8,0,0,8,0,0. But actual output is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nThis isn't working. Let's think differently. Maybe the output rows are formed by taking the input row's non-zero elements and arranging them in a certain pattern.\n\nExample0's output row1:8,8,0,8,8,0. The input row1 has 8,8. So perhaps the output row is arranging these two 8s with a zero in between, then repeating. So 8,8,0 followed by 8,8,0. Which matches. So for two non-zero elements, the triplet is 8,8,0. For one non-zero element, the triplet is 0,8,0. For three non-zero elements, triplet is 8,8,8.\n\nYes! So:\n\n- If an input row has 2 non-zero elements, the triplet is [value, value, 0].\n- If an input row has 1 non-zero element, the triplet is [0, value, 0].\n- If an input row has 3 non-zero elements, the triplet is [value, value, value].\n\nThen, each output row is the triplet repeated twice.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample0's row1: 2 non-zero elements (8,8) \u2192 triplet [8,8,0], output row [8,8,0,8,8,0] \u2192 correct.\n\nExample0's row2:1 non-zero (8) \u2192 triplet [0,8,0], output row [0,8,0,0,8,0] \u2192 correct.\n\nExample0's row3:3 non-zero elements (8,8,8) \u2192 triplet [8,8,8], output row [8,8,8,8,8,8] \u2192 correct.\n\nExample1's row5:1 non-zero (2) \u2192 triplet [0,2,0], output row [0,2,0,0,2,0] \u2192 correct.\n\nExample1's row6:3 non-zero (2,2,2) \u2192 triplet [2,2,2], output row [2,2,2,2,2,2] \u2192 correct.\n\nExample1's row7:2 non-zero (2,2) \u2192 triplet [2,2,0], output row [2,2,0,2,2,0] \u2192 correct.\n\nExample2's row1:2 non-zero (1,1) \u2192 triplet [1,1,0], output row [1,1,0,1,1,0]. But actual output row is [0,1,1,0,1,1]. So discrepancy.\n\nAh, wait. Example2's row1: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0]. The non-zero elements are at positions5 and6. So according to the pattern, triplet is [1,1,0], output row would be [1,1,0,1,1,0]. But the actual output row is [0,1,1,0,1,1]. So this suggests that the triplet is [0,1,1].\n\nHmm. So perhaps the triplet is determined by the first three elements of the non-zero sequence, padding with zeros if necessary.\n\nBut in Example2's row1, the non-zero elements start at position5. So the first three elements after position5 are 1,1,0. Which would give triplet [1,1,0]. But the output is [0,1,1,0,1,1]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the previous pattern is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the triplet is formed by taking the first three elements of the input row starting from the first non-zero element's position, then repeating this triplet.\n\nExample0's row1: first non-zero at1. Elements1,2,3:8,8,0 \u2192 triplet \u21928,8,0. Output row:8,8,0,8,8,0 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample0's row2: first non-zero at2. Elements2,3,4:8,0,0 \u2192 triplet \u21928,0,0. Output row:8,0,0,8,0,0. But actual output is [0,8,0,0,8,0]. So no.\n\nExample2's row1: first non-zero at5. Elements5,6,7:1,1,0 \u2192 triplet \u21921,1,0. Output row:1,1,0,1,1,0. But actual output is [0,1,1,0,1,1]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This is getting frustrating. Let's try to find another angle.\n\nLooking at Example2's output row1: [0,1,1,0,1,1]. This looks like two copies of [0,1,1]. How is this formed from the input row1: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0]. The non-zero elements are at positions5 and6. So maybe the triplet is [0,1,1], formed by the element before the first non-zero (position4:0), then the first non-zero and next. Then repeat \u21920,1,1,0,1,1. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern could be: For each non-zero row, take the three elements starting from the position before the first non-zero, then repeat this triplet. Let's check:\n\nExample0's row1: first non-zero at1. Positions0,1,2:0,8,8 \u2192 triplet \u21920,8,8. Output row:0,8,8,0,8,8. But actual output is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. No.\n\nExample0's row2: first non-zero at2. Positions1,2,3:0,8,0 \u2192 triplet \u21920,8,0. Output row:0,8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 which matches.\n\nExample0's row3: first non-zero at1. Positions0,1,2:0,8,8 \u2192 triplet \u21920,8,8. Output row:0,8,8,0,8,8. But actual output is [8,8,8,8,8,8]. No.\n\nExample2's row1: first non-zero at5. Positions4,5,6:0,1,1 \u2192 triplet \u21920,1,1. Output row:0,1,1,0,1,1 \u2192 matches.\n\nExample2's row2: first non-zero at4. Positions3,4,5:0,1,0 \u2192 triplet \u21920,1,0. Output row:0,1,0,0,1,0 \u2192 matches.\n\nExample2's row3: first non-zero at5. Positions4,5,6:0,1,0 \u2192 triplet \u21920,1,0. Output row:0,1,0,0,1,0 \u2192 matches.\n\nExample1's row5: first non-zero at3. Positions2,3,4:0,2,0 \u2192 triplet \u21920,2,0. Output row:0,2,0,0,2,0 \u2192 matches.\n\nExample1's row6: first non-zero at2. Positions1,2,3:0,2,2 \u2192 triplet \u21920,2,2. Output row:0,2,2,0,2,2. But actual output is [2,2,2,2,2,2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAh, here's the problem. Example1's row6's output is [2,2,2,2,2,2], which would require the triplet to be [2,2,2]. But according to this pattern, the triplet would be positions1,2,3:0,2,2. So output row would be 0,2,2,0,2,2. But actual output is all 2s. So this approach doesn't work for all cases.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is not uniform across all examples. Let's think again.\n\nIn Example1's row6: input row is [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]. The first non-zero is at position2. The triplet would be positions2,3,4:2,2,2. So output row would be 2,2,2,2,2,2 \u2192 which matches.\n\nBut according to the previous approach (positions before first non-zero), the triplet is positions1,2,3:0,2,2. Which doesn't match. So the correct pattern must be taking the first three consecutive non-zero elements. So for Example1's row6, the first three consecutive non-zero elements are at positions2,3,4:2,2,2. So triplet is 2,2,2 \u2192 output row is 2,2,2,2,2,2 \u2192 correct.\n\nFor Example0's row1, the first three consecutive non-zero elements are positions1,2:8,8. But we need three elements. So perhaps pad with zero. So triplet is8,8,0 \u2192 output row 8,8,0,8,8,0 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample0's row2: only one non-zero element at position2. So triplet is0,8,0 \u2192 output row0,8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample0's row3: three non-zero elements at positions1,2,3:8,8,8 \u2192 triplet \u2192 output row8,8,8,8,8,8 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample2's row1: two non-zero elements at5,6 \u2192 triplet 0,1,1 \u2192 output row0,1,1,0,1,1 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample2's row2: one non-zero at4 \u2192 triplet0,1,0 \u2192 output0,1,0,0,1,0 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample2's row3: one non-zero at5 \u2192 triplet0,1,0 \u2192 output0,1,0,0,1,0 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample1's row5: one non-zero at3 \u2192 triplet0,2,0 \u2192 output0,2,0,0,2,0 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample1's row6: three non-zero at2,3,4 \u2192 triplet2,2,2 \u2192 output2,2,2,2,2,2 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample1's row7: two non-zero at2,3 \u2192 triplet0,2,2 \u2192 output0,2,2,0,2,2 \u2192 but actual output is [2,2,0,2,2,0]. So discrepancy. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example1's row7: [0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. The first non-zero is at position2. The first three consecutive elements starting from position2 are2,2,0 \u2192 triplet2,2,0. Output row would be2,2,0,2,2,0 \u2192 which matches the actual output row3 of Example1. So this seems correct.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each non-zero input row, identify the first three consecutive elements starting from the first non-zero position. If there are not enough elements, pad with zeros. This forms a triplet. The output row is this triplet followed by the same triplet again.\n\nBut in Example1's row7, the triplet is2,2,0. Output row is2,2,0,2,2,0. Which matches.\n\nBut in Example2's row1, the triplet is1,1,0. Output row is0,1,1,0,1,1. Which doesn't fit. Unless there's a different way to determine the triplet.\n\nWait, Example2's row1: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0]. The first non-zero is at position5. The first three consecutive elements starting from position5 are1,1,0 \u2192 triplet1,1,0. Output row would be1,1,0,1,1,0. But actual output is [0,1,1,0,1,1]. So discrepancy.\n\nAh, so this approach isn't working for all cases. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the triplet is formed by the first three elements after the first non-zero, including the non-zero itself, and then padding with zeros if necessary. For example:\n\nExample0's row1: first non-zero at1. Triplet is elements1,2,3 \u21928,8,0. Output row:8,8,0,8,8,0 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample0's row2: elements2,3,4 \u21928,0,0. Output row:8,0,0,8,0,0. Doesn't match.\n\nExample1's row7: elements2,3,4 \u21922,2,0. Output row:2,2,0,2,2,0 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample2's row1: elements5,6,7 \u21921,1,0. Output row:1,1,0,1,1,0 \u2192 but actual output is [0,1,1,0,1,1]. So no.\n\nSo this approach works for some but not all.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the pattern that seems to fit most examples, even if there's a discrepancy in Example2's row1. Perhaps there's a different logic for when the first non-zero is near the end of the row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triplet is formed by the first non-zero and the next two elements, wrapping around to the start if necessary. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the triplet is always three elements, but if the first non-zero is in the last two positions, the triplet wraps around. For example, in Example2's row1, first non-zero at5. Elements5,6,0 \u21921,1,0. Then output row would be1,1,0,1,1,0. But actual output is [0,1,1,0,1,1].\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the pattern where each output row is formed by taking the first three consecutive elements starting from the first non-zero, then repeating that triplet. Even if it doesn't fit all cases, perhaps the test input can be handled.\n\nApplying this pattern to the test input:\n\nTest input's non-zero rows:\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 first non-zero at3. Triplet elements3,4,5:3,0,0. Output row:3,0,0,3,0,0.\n\nRow5: [0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 first non-zero at1. Triplet1,2,3:3,3,3. Output row:3,3,3,3,3,3.\n\nRow6: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 first non-zero at1. Triplet1,2,3:3,0,0. Output row:3,0,0,3,0,0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[3,0,0,3,0,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nBut according to the examples, the order of the output rows corresponds to the order of the non-zero input rows. So the test input's non-zero rows are row4, row5, row6. So the output rows are:\n\nRow4 \u2192 first triplet.\n\nRow5 \u2192 second triplet.\n\nRow6 \u2192 third triplet.\n\nThus, the expected output is:\n\n[3,0,0,3,0,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the output rows are ordered based on the input rows. For example, in Example0, the output rows correspond to rows1,2,3 of the input. So the order is preserved.\n\nThus, the final answer should be:\n\n[3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n[3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are three training examples and a test input. Each example has an 8x8 grid as input and a 3x6 grid as output. The goal is to find out how the input is transformed into the output and apply that to the test case.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nThe input has some 8s in the second, third, and fourth rows. The output is three rows. Let me see how the 8s are arranged. The output rows are:\n\n[8,8,0,8,8,0]\n[0,8,0,0,8,0]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nHmm, maybe the output is taking certain parts of the input. Let's look at the positions of the 8s in the input. The input rows with 8s are rows 1, 2, 3. Row 1 has columns 1 and 2 as 8, row 2 has column 2 as 8, row 3 has columns 1,2,3 as 8. \n\nWait, the output has three rows. Maybe each row of the output corresponds to a certain row in the input. Let's see. For example, the first output row in Example 0 has 8,8,0,8,8,0. That's six elements. The original input is 8 columns. Maybe they split the input rows into two parts and concatenate them? Or perhaps they take three rows from the input, each split into two parts, and arrange them into the output rows.\n\nWait, let's check the positions. For Example 0's input:\n\nRow 1: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 3: [0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe output rows are three. Let's see if they combine these three input rows. For instance, maybe each output row is a combination of two parts from the input rows. Let's take the first output row [8,8,0,8,8,0]. Let's split it into two halves: [8,8,0] and [8,8,0]. Where could these come from?\n\nLooking at input row 1: columns 1-3 are 8,8,0 (positions 1,2,3). Then maybe input row 3's columns 1-3: 8,8,8. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input rows and arranging them in some way.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the output is formed by taking the 3x3 blocks from the input and converting them into 3x6 by mirroring or something. But that might not fit.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nThe non-zero rows are row 5: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\nRow 6: [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]\nRow 7: [0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe output is three rows:\n\n[0,2,0,0,2,0]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,0,2,2,0]\n\nLooking at the first output row: 0,2,0,0,2,0. Maybe the first three elements are from row 5's middle part. Row5 has a 2 at column 4. If we take columns 3-5 of row5: 0,2,0. Then maybe columns 3-5 of row7 (0,2,2, but row7 is [0,0,2,2,0,...], so columns 3-5 would be 2,2,0. Wait, but the first output row of Example 1 is [0,2,0,0,2,0]. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is formed by combining two sections from the input. Let's think about the positions where non-zero numbers are in the input and see how they map to the output.\n\nAnother idea: The output is a compressed version where each row of the output is formed by taking two parts from the corresponding input row. For example, the first output row could be the left half and right half of the input row, but in Example 0, the first input row is [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. If we take the middle four elements (positions 2-5: 8,8,0,0), but that's four elements. Not sure.\n\nWait, all outputs are three rows. The inputs have non-zero values in certain rows. For example, in Example 0, the non-zero rows are rows 1, 2, 3. Then the output has three rows, each corresponding to one of these input rows. Let's check that.\n\nTake Example 0's input rows 1,2,3:\n\nRow1: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe output rows are:\n\n[8,8,0,8,8,0] \u2192 maybe row1 and row3?\n\nWait, the first output row has 8,8,0,8,8,0. If we take the 8,8,0 from row1 (columns 1-3) and then 8,8,0 from row3 (columns 1-3), but row3's columns 1-3 are 8,8,8. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is made by taking the non-zero parts of the input row and then mirroring or extending. For instance, row1 has 8,8 in columns 2 and 3 (indexes 1 and 2 if starting from 0). So maybe the output row for that is 8,8,0 and then mirrored as 8,8,0 again? That would give 8,8,0,8,8,0. Which matches the first output row of Example 0.\n\nSimilarly, row2 of input has a single 8 at column 3 (index 2). So taking 0,8,0 (maybe the 8 is in the middle) and then mirrored as 0,8,0 \u2192 combining to 0,8,0,0,8,0. Which matches the second output row.\n\nRow3 of input has 8,8,8 in columns 1-3 (0,1,2 indexes). If we take 8,8,8 and then mirror that as 8,8,8, but the output row is [8,8,8,8,8,8]. Wait, the output row is all 8s. Hmm. So for row3, maybe the output is taking the three 8s and extending them to six elements by duplicating, but how?\n\nWait, the third output row of Example 0 is [8,8,8,8,8,8]. So all 8s. That could be taking the 8s from row3's columns 1-3 (8,8,8) and then perhaps mirroring or repeating them. If we take 8,8,8 and reverse them, but they're the same. So 8,8,8,8,8,8. So that's possible.\n\nSo the pattern could be: for each input row that has non-zero elements, create an output row by taking the three middle elements (columns 2-4?), but maybe the exact positions vary. Wait, in Example 0's row1, the 8s are in columns 1 and 2 (indexes 1 and 2), but the output's first three elements are 8,8,0. So perhaps taking columns 1-3 (8,8,0) and then columns 1-3 again (8,8,0), making the first output row as [8,8,0,8,8,0]. That seems possible.\n\nSimilarly, for row2 in input Example 0: columns 1-3 are 0,8,0. So taking those and appending again 0,8,0 would give [0,8,0,0,8,0], which matches the second output row.\n\nRow3 in input Example 0 has columns 1-3 as 8,8,8. Appending them gives 8,8,8,8,8,8. So that's the third output row.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each of the non-zero rows in the input (starting from the first non-zero row up to the third?), take columns 1-3 (indexes 1,2,3) of that row, then repeat them, and combine the two parts to form a 6-element row. Wait, but in Example 0, row1's columns 1-3 are 8,8,0 \u2192 combined with 8,8,0 again gives the first output row. But for row3, columns 1-3 are 8,8,8 \u2192 repeat to get 8,8,8,8,8,8. Yes.\n\nTesting this with Example 1:\n\nInput rows 5,6,7 (since those are the non-zero rows in the input):\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns 1-3 (0,0,0)? Wait, columns are indexes 0-7. Columns 1-3 would be 0,0,0. But in the output's first row, it's [0,2,0,0,2,0]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the columns are different.\n\nWait in Example 1's input, the non-zero rows are rows 5,6,7:\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column 3 (index 3) is 2.\nRow6: [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 columns 2-4 (indexes 2,3,4) are 2,2,2.\nRow7: [0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns 2-3 (indexes 2,3) are 2,2.\n\nSo for row5, columns 1-3 (indexes 1-3) would be 0,0,0. But the output's first row is [0,2,0,0,2,0]. Hmm, maybe the middle columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each non-zero row, take the three middle columns. For example, in an 8-column row, the middle three columns would be columns 3,4,5 (indexes 2,3,4). Let's check:\n\nFor Example 1's row5: columns 3,4,5 are 2,0,0. But the first output row starts with 0,2,0. That doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe the columns around the non-zero elements.\n\nWait in row5, the 2 is at column 3 (index 3). So maybe take columns 2-4: indexes 2,3,4 \u2192 0,2,0. Then duplicate that to get [0,2,0,0,2,0], which matches the first output row of Example 1. Yes! So that's the pattern.\n\nSimilarly, row6: columns 2-4 are 2,2,2. Duplicate to [2,2,2,2,2,2], which is the second output row.\n\nRow7: columns 2-4 are 2,2,0. Duplicate gives [2,2,0,2,2,0], which is the third output row.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each of the three rows in the input that contain non-zero elements (presumably the three bottom-most non-zero rows?), take columns 2-4 (indexes 2,3,4) of that row, then duplicate those three elements to form a six-element output row.\n\nWait, let's check Example 2.\n\nExample 2's input non-zero rows are row1, row2, row3:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0] \u2192 columns 2-4 (indexes 2-4) are 0,0,0. But that doesn't match the output. Wait, the output for Example 2 is:\n\n[0,1,1,0,1,1]\n[1,0,0,1,0,0]\n[0,1,0,0,1,0]\n\nHmm. Let's check row1 of input. The non-zero elements are in columns 5 and 6 (indexes 5,6) which are 1,1. So columns 5-7 (indexes 5,6,7) are 1,1,0. But the first output row is [0,1,1, 0,1,1]. So taking columns 5-7 (1,1,0), then maybe padding or something? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the three columns around the non-zero elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the columns selected vary based on the position of the non-zero elements. For example, in Example 0, the non-zero elements were in columns 1,2,3. In Example 1, columns 3,4, and 2-4. In Example 2, columns 5 and 6.\n\nWait, maybe it's taking the three columns starting from the first non-zero element. Let's look at Example 2's row1: the first non-zero is at column 5 (index5). So take columns 5-7: 1,1,0. Then duplicate to form [1,1,0,1,1,0]. But the output's first row is [0,1,1,0,1,1]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three columns centered around the first non-zero element. For row1 of Example2, the first non-zero is at column5. So center is column5, take columns4-6: indexes4-6: 0,1,1. Then duplicate those: [0,1,1,0,1,1]. That matches the first output row. Yes!\n\nSimilarly, row2 of Example2: input row2 is [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. The non-zero is at column4 (index4). So center is column4, take columns3-5: indexes3-5: 0,1,0. Duplicate \u2192 [0,1,0,0,1,0]. But the output's second row is [1,0,0,1,0,0]. Hmm, that's different. Wait, maybe the middle three columns. Wait, row2 has the 1 at index4. So columns3-5: 0,1,0. Duplicate would be [0,1,0,0,1,0], which is not matching the output. The output's second row is [1,0,0,1,0,0].\n\nWait, perhaps the selection is different. Let's look at the output rows for Example2:\n\nFirst output row: [0,1,1,0,1,1]. So the first three elements are 0,1,1. The next three are 0,1,1. So that's columns5,6,7 from row1: 1,1,0 \u2192 but then mirrored? Or perhaps it's columns4,5,6: 0,1,1 \u2192 that's possible. Then duplicated gives 0,1,1,0,1,1. Which matches. So perhaps the center is the first non-zero element's column. For row1, first non-zero is column5. So take the three columns starting two to the left. For column5 (index5), maybe columns3-5? No. Wait, perhaps it's the three columns starting at the first non-zero's position and extending right. For example, in row1 of Example2, the first non-zero is column5 (1), then take columns5-7: 1,1,0. But the first part of the output is 0,1,1. That's columns4-6 (0,1,1). So maybe it's taking the three columns that include the first non-zero and the next two. Wait, column5 is the first non-zero. Then columns5,6,7 would be 1,1,0. But output starts with 0,1,1. So perhaps it's columns4,5,6 (0,1,1) from row1. Then duplicated \u2192 [0,1,1,0,1,1]. Yes. That matches. So the selection is the three columns starting one to the left of the first non-zero in the row. Hmm, that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three columns are selected such that they include all non-zero elements in the row. For Example2's row1, the non-zeros are in columns5 and6. So perhaps columns4-6 (0,1,1) to capture the 1s. Then duplicate them, leading to the first output row.\n\nRow2 of Example2's input: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. The non-zero is at column4. So take columns3-5 (0,1,0). Duplicate \u2192 [0,1,0,0,1,0]. But the output's second row is [1,0,0,1,0,0]. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the selection is the three columns centered around the leftmost non-zero in the row. For row2 of Example2, leftmost non-zero is column4. So center is column4, take columns3-5 (0,1,0). Duplicate \u2192 0,1,0,0,1,0. But output is [1,0,0,1,0,0]. Not matching. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to take the three consecutive columns where the majority of non-zero elements are located. Let's look at Example2's row3: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. Non-zero at column5. So columns4-6 would be 0,1,0. Duplicate \u2192 0,1,0,0,1,0. The third output row for Example2 is [0,1,0,0,1,0]. Which matches. So maybe for each row, we take the three columns that include the non-zero elements, then duplicate them.\n\nBut how does that work for row2 of Example2? The non-zero is at column4. So take columns3-5 (0,1,0) \u2192 duplicates to 0,1,0,0,1,0. But the output's second row is [1,0,0,1,0,0]. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three columns are selected as the columns where the non-zero elements start. For Example2's row1, non-zero starts at column5. So take columns5-7 (1,1,0). Then perhaps mirror them. 1,1,0 mirrored is 0,1,1. Then combining them as 1,1,0,0,1,1 \u2192 but the output is 0,1,1,0,1,1. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to find another approach. All output rows are three rows, each made by two parts of three elements each. So each output row is formed by two groups of three elements. Maybe each group is a horizontal slice from the input grid.\n\nLooking at Example0's input: the 8s form a sort of shape. The output seems to be a condensed version. For example, the first output row has 8,8,0 and 8,8,0. Maybe it's taking two horizontal slices from the input rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking each non-zero row, extracting a 3x3 block around the non-zero elements, then transforming that into a 3x6 by mirroring. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: The output rows have the same number as the input (e.g., 8, 2, 1 in the examples). The output seems to be a condensed version where each row in the output corresponds to a row in the input. For each input row, we take a 3-element segment and duplicate it.\n\nBut in Example0's row1: the 8s are at columns1 and 2. The output first row is [8,8,0,8,8,0]. So that's 8,8,0 repeated twice. Which would correspond to taking columns1-3 (8,8,0) and duplicating. Similarly, row2's output is [0,8,0,0,8,0], which is columns1-3 (0,8,0) duplicated. Row3's columns1-3 are 8,8,8 \u2192 duplicated gives 8,8,8,8,8,8.\n\nSo the pattern could be: For each of the three rows in the input that have non-zero elements, take columns1-3 (indices 0-2?), wait columns are 0-based. Wait, in Example0's row1: columns are 0-7. The values are [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Columns1-3 are 8,8,0. Which when duplicated gives 8,8,0,8,8,0. Which matches the first output row. So that's columns1-3 (indices 1,2,3). Wait, no. Because columns1-3 in 0-based indexing would be indexes 1,2,3. Which in row1's case are 8,8,0. So yes, that matches.\n\nRow2 of Example0: columns1-3 are 0,8,0 \u2192 duplicated \u2192 0,8,0,0,8,0. Which matches.\n\nRow3 of Example0: columns1-3 are 8,8,8 \u2192 duplicated \u2192 8,8,8,8,8,8. Which matches.\n\nSo this seems to fit Example0.\n\nTesting Example1:\n\nThe non-zero rows are rows5,6,7.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. Columns1-3 (indexes1-3) are 0,0,0. So duplicated would be all zeros. But the first output row is [0,2,0,0,2,0]. So that doesn't match. Hmm. So maybe this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nWait, but in Example1, the first output row is [0,2,0,0,2,0]. If we take columns3-5 (indexes3-5) for row5: 2,0,0. Then duplicated \u2192 2,0,0,2,0,0. Which doesn't match. So maybe the pattern isn't columns1-3. Then why does it work for Example0 and not Example1?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns selected are based on the position of the non-zero elements. For each row, take the three columns that contain the non-zero elements and their neighbors.\n\nIn Example1's row5: the non-zero is at column3. So maybe take columns2-4 (0,2,0). Then duplicated \u2192 0,2,0,0,2,0. Which matches the first output row. Yes! That's possible. So for each row, take the three columns centered on the first non-zero element. For Example0's row1, the first non-zero is at column1. So centered there would be columns0-2? Wait, but in Example0 row1, the first non-zero is at column1 (value 8). So the three columns would be columns0,1,2. But column0 is 0. So that gives 0,8,8. Duplicated would be 0,8,8,0,8,8. Which is not the case. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach isn't correct. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at all examples:\n\nThe output rows are formed by taking three elements from the input row, then duplicating them. The three elements seem to be centered around the non-zero elements.\n\nFor Example0's row1: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. The non-zeros are at positions1 and2. The three elements could be positions1-3: 8,8,0. Which is taken and duplicated \u2192 [8,8,0,8,8,0].\n\nFor Example1's row5: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. Non-zero at position3. The three elements could be positions2-4: 0,2,0 \u2192 duplicated \u2192 [0,2,0,0,2,0].\n\nFor Example1's row6: [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]. Non-zeros at positions2-4. The three elements are 2,2,2 \u2192 duplicated \u2192 [2,2,2,2,2,2].\n\nFor Example1's row7: [0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. Non-zeros at positions2 and3. The three elements could be positions2-4: 2,2,0 \u2192 duplicated \u2192 [2,2,0,2,2,0].\n\nThat fits. So for each row, take the three elements starting from the leftmost non-zero's position minus one, but it's easier to think that it's the three columns including the non-zero elements. So the three columns are centered around the non-zero elements.\n\nSo the pattern is: For each of the three input rows containing non-zero elements, take the three consecutive columns that include the first occurrence of the non-zero and the next two columns, then duplicate that triplet to form a six-element output row.\n\nWait, in Example0's row1: first non-zero at column1. Take columns1-3 (8,8,0). Duplicate \u2192 8,8,0,8,8,0.\n\nIn Example1's row5: first non-zero at column3. Take columns3-5 (2,0,0) \u2192 duplicated \u2192 2,0,0,2,0,0. But the output is [0,2,0,0,2,0]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, in Example1's row5, the output row is [0,2,0,0,2,0]. So the triplet is 0,2,0. That would be columns2-4: 0,2,0. Which when duplicated gives 0,2,0,0,2,0. Which matches. So how do we determine which three columns to take?\n\nIt seems that for each row, the three columns are the ones that include the non-zero element(s) and the surrounding columns. So for a single non-zero element in a row (like Example1's row5), the three columns are centered around it. So column3 (the non-zero) is the middle of the three columns: columns2-4. Which gives 0,2,0. Then duplicated.\n\nSo general rule: For each row with non-zero elements, take the three columns starting from (leftmost non-zero -1) to (leftmost non-zero +1), ensuring we don't go out of bounds, then duplicate those three columns to form six elements.\n\nSo for Example0's row1:\n\nLeftmost non-zero at column1. So columns0-2: 0,8,8. But that's not the case. The triplet is 8,8,0. So perhaps it's columns1-3.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's leftmost non-zero and the next two columns. For Example0's row1, leftmost is column1. Take columns1-3 \u2192 8,8,0. Which is correct.\n\nFor Example1's row5: leftmost non-zero is column3. Take columns3-5 \u2192 2,0,0. But that's not matching. But the output is 0,2,0. Which is columns2-4. So that's leftmost non-zero minus one to plus one. So if the leftmost is column3, the three columns are 2-4.\n\nAh, that's it. So the three columns are the leftmost non-zero index minus one, leftmost, and leftmost plus one. If the leftmost non-zero is at index i, then columns i-1, i, i+1.\n\nLet's test:\n\nExample0's row1: leftmost at 1. So columns0,1,2. Values are 0,8,8. But the triplet taken was 8,8,0 (columns1,2,3). So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait this approach may not work. Let's think of another way.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nIn Example0's input row1: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe non-zeros are at positions1 and2. The triplet taken is columns1-3: 8,8,0.\n\nIn Example1's input row5: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nNon-zero at position3. Triplet is columns2-4: 0,2,0.\n\nIn Example1's input row6: [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nNon-zeros from positions2-4. Triplet is columns2-4: 2,2,2.\n\nIn Example1's input row7: [0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nNon-zeros at positions2 and3. Triplet is columns2-4: 2,2,0.\n\nSo for each row, the triplet is columns (leftmost non-zero index -1) to (leftmost non-zero index +1). Wait:\n\nFor Example0 row1: leftmost is1. So 1-1=0, 1+1=2. So columns0-2: 0,8,8. But the triplet taken was columns1-3. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triplet is the leftmost non-zero index and the next two columns. For Example0 row1, leftmost is1 \u2192 columns1,2,3. Which gives 8,8,0. Which matches.\n\nFor Example1 row5: leftmost is3 \u2192 columns3,4,5. Values 2,0,0. But the triplet is 0,2,0. Which is columns2-4. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's centered on the leftmost non-zero. For Example0 row1, leftmost is1. So center is1. Take columns0-2 (0,8,8) or 1-3 (8,8,0). The latter gives the correct triplet.\n\nFor Example1 row5, leftmost is3. Center is3. Take columns2-4 (0,2,0). Which matches the triplet.\n\nAh! So the rule is: For each row, find the leftmost non-zero element. Take the three columns starting from (leftmost index -1) to (leftmost index +1). So columns (leftmost-1, leftmost, leftmost+1). This ensures the triplet is centered on the leftmost non-zero, including one column to the left and right.\n\nYes, this seems to fit all examples.\n\nExample0 row1: leftmost is1. So columns0,1,2: 0,8,8. But wait, that's not the case. The triplet is 8,8,0. Which is columns1,2,3. Hmm. So this approach may not work.\n\nWait, perhaps for each row, the three columns are the leftmost non-zero, the next one to the right, and the one after that. So for Example0 row1, leftmost is1, so columns1,2,3: 8,8,0.\n\nExample1 row5: leftmost is3 \u2192 columns3,4,5: 2,0,0. But output triplet is0,2,0. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the pattern is that for each row, the triplet is columns (leftmost non-zero index -1), leftmost, leftmost +1. But if the leftmost is at index0, then adjust to stay within bounds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triplet is the three columns that contain the leftmost non-zero and the two columns to its right.\n\nFor Example0 row1: leftmost non-zero is1. So columns1,2,3: 8,8,0. Which matches the triplet.\n\nExample1 row5: leftmost non-zero is3 \u2192 columns3,4,5:2,0,0. But output triplet is0,2,0. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Let's re-examine Example1's output.\n\nExample1's input row5: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. The triplet taken is columns2-4 (0,2,0). Output row is [0,2,0,0,2,0]. So the triplet is 0,2,0.\n\nBut according to the leftmost non-zero index3, columns3,4,5 would be 2,0,0. Not matching.\n\nSo why is the triplet 0,2,0 in this case? Because the triplet is columns2-4. So perhaps the triplet is leftmost non-zero index minus1, leftmost, leftmost+1. For leftmost3, that's columns2,3,4:0,2,0. Which matches.\n\nYes! That's the pattern. For each row, the three columns are (leftmost non-zero index -1), leftmost, leftmost +1. So three columns centered around the leftmost non-zero.\n\nSo in Example0 row1: leftmost non-zero is1. Columns0,1,2:0,8,8. But the triplet taken was columns1-3 (8,8,0). So this contradicts. Wait, no. Wait, maybe the leftmost non-zero is1. So triplet is1-1=0,1,1+1=2. Columns0-2. Values0,8,8. But the output triplet is8,8,0. Which is columns1-3.\n\nHmm, this is not aligning. I must be making a mistake here.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nFor each row with non-zero elements:\n\n1. Find the leftmost non-zero column index (starting from 0).\n2. Take the three columns: (leftmost-1), leftmost, (leftmost+1).\n3. If leftmost-1 is negative, then adjust to start from leftmost.\n4. Duplicate these three columns to form a six-element row.\n\nWait, in Example0 row1: leftmost is1. So columns0,1,2. Values0,8,8. Duplicate would be0,8,8,0,8,8. But the output is8,8,0,8,8,0. So this doesn't match.\n\nSo this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the triplet is taken from the columns where the non-zero elements are present. For Example0 row1, the non-zeros are in columns1 and2. So triplet is columns1,2,3:8,8,0. Which is correct. For Example1 row5, non-zero in column3. So triplet is columns3-5:2,0,0. But output is0,2,0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triplet is the leftmost non-zero, the next non-zero to the right, and the one after that. For Example0 row1, leftmost is1. Next non-zero is2. So columns1,2,3 (8,8,0). Which matches. For Example1 row5, leftmost is3. Next non-zero is none. So triplet is3,4,5:2,0,0. Output is0,2,0. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAll outputs have three rows, each row being a duplication of a three-element segment from the corresponding input row.\n\nIn Example0's input, the three non-zero rows are rows1,2,3.\n\nFor each of these rows:\n\n- Row1: [0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 triplet 8,8,0 (columns1-3) \u2192 output row 8,8,0,8,8,0.\n\n- Row2: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 triplet 0,8,0 (columns1-3) \u2192 output row 0,8,0,0,8,0.\n\n- Row3: [0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0] \u2192 triplet 8,8,8 (columns1-3) \u2192 output row 8,8,8,8,8,8.\n\nSo the pattern here is taking columns1-3 (indexes1-3) of each row and duplicating.\n\nExample1's input non-zero rows are rows5,6,7.\n\n- Row5: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns1-3 (0,0,0) \u2192 but output row is0,2,0,0,2,0. Doesn't match.\n\nSo this approach only works for Example0.\n\nBut what's different in Example1 and Example2?\n\nIn Example1's row5: non-zero is in column3. The triplet is columns3-5:2,0,0. But output is0,2,0.\n\nWait, perhaps in Example1, for row5, the triplet is columns2-4:0,2,0. Which when duplicated gives0,2,0,0,2,0. So why columns2-4 here?\n\nMaybe the triplet is taken such that the first element is the first non-zero in the row. Let's see:\n\nExample0 row1: first non-zero is column1. Take columns1-3.\n\nExample1 row5: first non-zero is column3. Take columns3-5. But output's first triplet is0,2,0. Which is columns2-4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triplet is centered around the non-zero element. For Example0 row1, the non-zero elements are at columns1 and2. The center is column1.5, so take columns1-3. For Example1 row5, the non-zero is at column3, center is3. So take columns2-4.\n\nYes! This seems to be the case. Centered on the leftmost non-zero, taking one to the left and right.\n\nExample0 row1: leftmost non-zero is1. So columns0,1,2. But triplet is1-3. So perhaps the center is the leftmost non-zero, and then take the three columns including the center and one to each side.\n\nWait, for Example0 row1, leftmost is1. So columns1 is the center. Take columns0,1,2 \u2192 triplet0,8,8. But output triplet is8,8,0. So that's not matching. Alternatively, center is the leftmost non-zero and take one to the right. So columns1,2,3.\n\nYes, that works. So for Example0 row1, leftmost non-zero is1. Take columns1,2,3 (8,8,0). For Example1 row5, leftmost non-zero is3. Take columns3,4,5 (2,0,0). But output triplet is0,2,0. So that doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This is getting too complicated. Let me think of the Test Input and see if I can find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n[0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n[0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe non-zero rows are row4,5,6.\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 leftmost non-zero at column3.\n\nRow5: [0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 leftmost non-zero at column1.\n\nRow6: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 leftmost non-zero at column1.\n\nSo according to the pattern observed in Example0, each output row is columns1-3 of the corresponding input row, then duplicated.\n\nFor row4: columns1-3 are0,0,0. Duplicated would be0,0,0,0,0,0. But that's probably not correct.\n\nAlternatively, according to the pattern where the triplet is centered around the leftmost non-zero:\n\nRow4's leftmost non-zero is3. So take columns2-4:0,3,0 \u2192 duplicated \u21920,3,0,0,3,0.\n\nRow5's leftmost non-zero is1. So take columns0-2:0,3,3 \u2192 duplicated \u21920,3,3,0,3,3.\n\nRow6's leftmost non-zero is1. So take columns0-2:0,3,0 \u2192 duplicated \u21920,3,0,0,3,0.\n\nBut the expected output is:\n\nAssuming similar to previous examples, the output would have three rows.\n\nBut according to this, the output would be:\n\nFor row4: [0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nFor row5: [0,3,3,0,3,3]\n\nFor row6: [0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nBut let's check if this aligns with the training examples.\n\nExample1's row5 (input) had leftmost non-zero at3. The output row was0,2,0,0,2,0. Which corresponds to columns2-4 (0,2,0).\n\nSimilarly, for the Test Input's row4: columns2-4 are0,3,0 \u2192 duplicated to0,3,0,0,3,0. Which matches the format of Example1's first output row.\n\nFor Test row5: leftmost non-zero is1. columns0-2:0,3,3 \u2192 duplicated \u21920,3,3,0,3,3. But Example0's first row, which had leftmost non-zero at1, took columns1-3. So maybe in this case, columns1-3 would be3,3,3. Duplicated would give3,3,3,3,3,3.\n\nBut row5's input is [0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]. columns1-3 are3,3,3. So duplicated would be3,3,3,3,3,3. Which matches Example0's third output row (all 8s).\n\nFor row6's input: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]. leftmost non-zero is1. columns1-3 are3,0,0. Duplicated \u21923,0,0,3,0,0. But according to Example1's row7, which had non-zeros at2 and3, the triplet was2,2,0 \u2192 duplicated to2,2,0,2,2,0. So for row6, the triplet would be3,0,0 \u2192 duplicated to3,0,0,3,0,0. But this doesn't match the pattern of Example2's output.\n\nWait, in Example2's row3 input: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. The triplet was columns4-6:0,1,0. So duplicated \u21920,1,0,0,1,0. Which matches the third output row.\n\nSo for the Test Input:\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 leftmost non-zero at3. So triplet is columns2-4 (0,3,0) \u2192 output row [0,3,0,0,3,0].\n\nRow5: [0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 leftmost non-zero at1. So triplet is columns0-2 (0,3,3). But according to Example0, when the leftmost is1, the triplet is columns1-3 (3,3,3). So duplicated gives3,3,3,3,3,3 \u2192 [3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nRow6: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 leftmost non-zero at1. So triplet is columns1-3 (3,0,0). Duplicated gives3,0,0,3,0,0 \u2192 [3,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nBut let's see if this matches the training examples.\n\nExample0's row3: leftmost non-zero at1. Triplet columns1-3 (8,8,8) \u2192 output row [8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nExample1's row6: leftmost non-zero at2. Triplet columns1-3 (0,2,2) \u2192 but output row is [2,2,2,2,2,2]. Wait, no. In Example1's row6, the triplet is2,2,2 \u2192 columns2-4. So perhaps the pattern is to take three columns starting from the leftmost non-zero. For example, leftmost is1 \u2192 columns1,2,3. For Example1's row5: leftmost is3 \u2192 columns3,4,5. But output is0,2,0 \u2192 columns2-4.\n\nThis inconsistency is confusing. Maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAnother observation: All output rows in the examples have the non-zero elements spread out. For example, in Example0's output, the first row has 8s in the first two positions and the fourth and fifth. This suggests that the output is created by taking a segment from the input row and placing it in the first half and the second half of the output row.\n\nFor instance, in Example0's first output row: the first three elements are8,8,0 and the next three are8,8,0. So it's the same segment repeated. Similarly for the other rows.\n\nSo the pattern is: For each non-zero row in the input, take a three-column segment and repeat it to form a six-column output row.\n\nThe challenge is to determine which three columns are taken for each row.\n\nLooking at Example0's input rows:\n\nRow1: 0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 triplet is8,8,0 (columns1-3).\n\nRow2:0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 triplet is0,8,0 (columns1-3).\n\nRow3:0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0 \u2192 triplet is8,8,8 (columns1-3).\n\nExample1's input rows:\n\nRow5:0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0 \u2192 triplet is0,2,0 (columns2-4).\n\nRow6:0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0 \u2192 triplet is2,2,2 (columns2-4).\n\nRow7:0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0 \u2192 triplet is2,2,0 (columns2-4).\n\nExample2's input rows:\n\nRow1:0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0 \u2192 triplet is0,1,1 (columns4-6).\n\nRow2:0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0 \u2192 triplet is1,0,0 (columns4-6).\n\nRow3:0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0 \u2192 triplet is0,1,0 (columns5-7).\n\nSo the triplet varies based on the position of the non-zero elements. It seems that the triplet is taken starting at the column of the first non-zero in the row minus one, to ensure it's centered. But for Example2's row3, the first non-zero is at column5 (index5). So triplet is columns4-6:0,1,0. Which is correct for that row's output.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nIt appears that for each row, the three-column segment is taken such that it includes the first non-zero element and extends two columns to the right. So for a row with the first non-zero at column i, the triplet is columns i-1, i, i+1. If i-1 is negative, adjust to start at i.\n\nWait in Example0's row1: first non-zero at column1 (i=1). triplet is i-1=0, i=1, i+1=2 \u2192 columns0-2:0,8,8. But the triplet taken was1-3:8,8,0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, triplet is columns i, i+1, i+2. For Example0 row1: i=1 \u2192 columns1,2,3:8,8,0. Correct.\n\nExample1 row5: first non-zero at3 \u2192 columns3,4,5:2,0,0. But the output is0,2,0. So triplet is columns2-4:0,2,0.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nThis suggests that there's no consistent rule. However, looking at all examples, the triplet is the three consecutive columns that contain the first non-zero and the two columns to its right. So for a row with first non-zero at column i, triplet is i, i+1, i+2.\n\nFor Example0 row1: i=1 \u2192 1,2,3 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample1 row5: i=3 \u21923,4,5 \u2192 values2,0,0. But output triplet is0,2,0 (columns2-4). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the triplet is the three columns starting two columns to the left of the first non-zero and including it. For Example1 row5: first non-zero at3. Two columns to the left is1. So columns1-3:0,0,2. No.\n\nAlternatively, the triplet is the first three columns where the first non-zero occurs. For Example0 row1: non-zero starts at1. So columns1-3.\n\nExample1 row5: non-zero starts at3. So columns3-5. Output triplet is0,2,0 \u2192 columns2-4. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really frustrating. Let's try to find another approach.\n\nAnother possible pattern is that the output rows are created by taking the three middle columns of the input rows. For an 8-column input, the middle three columns would be columns3,4,5 (indices3,4,5). But in Example0, the triplet is columns1-3. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are created by taking the three columns that contain the maximum number of non-zero elements in the row.\n\nFor Example0 row1: columns1 and2 have non-zeros \u2192 triplet is1-3.\n\nExample1 row5: column3 has non-zero \u2192 triplet is2-4 (columns with non-zero in the middle).\n\nExample1 row6: columns2-4 have non-zeros \u2192 triplet is2-4.\n\nExample1 row7: columns2-3 have non-zeros \u2192 triplet is2-4.\n\nExample2 row1: columns5-6 have non-zeros \u2192 triplet is4-6.\n\nExample2 row2: column4 has non-zero \u2192 triplet is3-5.\n\nExample2 row3: column5 has non-zero \u2192 triplet is4-6.\n\nSo perhaps the triplet is centered around the column with the most non-zero elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the triplet is the three columns that include the majority of non-zero elements in the row. For Example0 row1: non-zeros in columns1 and2. Triplet1-3 includes both. For Example1 row5: non-zero in column3. Triplet2-4 includes it. For Example1 row6: non-zeros in columns2-4. Triplet2-4 includes them.\n\nThis seems possible. So the triplet is columns (leftmost non-zero -1) to (leftmost non-zero +1), but adjusted to fit the row's bounds.\n\nFor example:\n\nExample1 row5: leftmost non-zero is3. So triplet is2-4. Which includes the non-zero at3 and some zeros. That fits the output triplet0,2,0.\n\nExample0 row1: leftmost is1. Triplet0-2 includes column1 and2's non-zeros. But the triplet taken was1-3. So not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the triplet is selected to include all non-zero elements in the row, if possible. For Example0 row1, non-zeros are in1-2. So triplet1-3 includes them. For Example1 row5, non-zero is3. Triplet2-4 includes it. For Example1 row6, non-zeros are2-4, triplet2-4 includes them.\n\nSo the pattern could be: For each row, select the three columns that cover all non-zero elements in that row. If there are more than three columns with non-zero elements, select the first three. If the non-zero elements are spread out, take the leftmost three.\n\nBut how does this fit with Example2?\n\nExample2's row1: non-zeros are5 and6. So triplet4-6 (columns4-6) would include them. Which gives0,1,1 \u2192 matching the output.\n\nRow2 of Example2: non-zero at4. Triplet3-5 \u21920,1,0 \u2192 output is1,0,0. Doesn't match.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nAt this point, I think the only way to proceed is to assume that for each row in the input, the output row is formed by taking columns (n-3) to (n-1), where n is the column index of the first non-zero in the row. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to take the three columns where the non-zero elements are located and mirror them. For example, if the non-zero elements are in columns1-3, then mirroring them gives the output row.\n\nBut in Example0's row1: non-zeros in1-2. Triplet is8,8,0. Mirrored would be0,8,8 \u2192 but the output is8,8,0,8,8,0. Which is the triplet followed by itself.\n\nSo the output is the triplet duplicated.\n\nYes, that's the case. So for each row, the triplet is taken, then duplicated to form the six-element output row.\n\nThe key is to determine which triplet is taken. From the examples, it seems that the triplet is the three columns starting from the first non-zero column in the row.\n\nExample0 row1: first non-zero at1. So triplet columns1-3.\n\nExample1 row5: first non-zero at3. So triplet columns3-5.\n\nBut in Example1's output, the triplet is0,2,0. Which is columns2-4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let's try to think differently.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nNon-zero rows are rows4,5,6.\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 first non-zero at3. If triplet is columns3-5:3,0,0 \u2192 duplicated gives3,0,0,3,0,0.\n\nRow5: [0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 first non-zero at1. triplet1-3:3,3,3 \u2192 duplicated gives3,3,3,3,3,3.\n\nRow6: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 first non-zero at1. triplet1-3:3,0,0 \u2192 duplicated gives3,0,0,3,0,0.\n\nBut the expected output based on previous examples would be:\n\nFor row4: triplet columns2-4 (0,3,0) \u2192 duplicated0,3,0,0,3,0.\n\nFor row5: triplet columns1-3 (3,3,3) \u2192 duplicated3,3,3,3,3,3.\n\nFor row6: triplet columns1-3 (3,0,0) \u2192 duplicated3,0,0,3,0,0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples:\n\nIn Example1's row5: first non-zero at3 \u2192 triplet3-5:2,0,0. But output row is0,2,0,0,2,0. Which suggests triplet is columns2-4:0,2,0.\n\nSo this suggests that the triplet is columns (first non-zero -1) to (first non-zero +1).\n\nFor the test input row4: first non-zero at3. So triplet2-4:0,3,0 \u2192 duplicated \u21920,3,0,0,3,0.\n\nRow5: first non-zero at1. triplet0-2:0,3,3 \u2192 duplicated \u21920,3,3,0,3,3. But this contradicts Example0's row1, where first non-zero is1 and triplet is1-3.\n\nThis inconsistency is perplexing. Maybe the pattern isn't consistent across examples, but there's another underlying rule.\n\nAnother observation: The output rows in the training examples have the same number of non-zero elements as the corresponding input row, but arranged in a mirrored or duplicated fashion.\n\nExample0 row1: two 8s. Output row has four 8s (two sets of two).\n\nExample1 row5: one 2. Output row has two 2s.\n\nExample1 row6: three 2s. Output row has six 2s.\n\nExample1 row7: two 2s. Output row has four 2s.\n\nExample2 row1: two 1s. Output row has four 1s.\n\nExample2 row2: one 1. Output row has two 1s.\n\nExample2 row3: one 1. Output row has two 1s.\n\nSo the output rows have twice the number of non-zero elements as the input rows. So the pattern is to duplicate the non-zero elements by taking a segment and repeating it.\n\nBut how to determine the segment?\n\nFinally, after struggling, I think the correct pattern is that for each row with non-zero elements, the three columns selected are those starting from the first non-zero column and the next two columns. Then duplicate this triplet.\n\nFor Example0 row1: first non-zero at1 \u2192 triplet1-3:8,8,0 \u2192 duplicated.\n\nExample1 row5: first non-zero at3 \u2192 triplet3-5:2,0,0 \u2192 duplicated gives2,0,0,2,0,0. But the output is0,2,0,0,2,0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but the output for Example1 row5 is0,2,0,0,2,0. So the triplet is0,2,0. Which is columns2-4. So first non-zero is3. So triplet would start at3-5, but the triplet is columns2-4. So this suggests that the triplet is first non-zero index minus1 to plus1.\n\nWhich would mean for first non-zero at3, triplet is2-4. Which is0,2,0.\n\nYes. So the pattern is: For each row, take the three columns centered around the first non-zero element. So columns (first non-zero -1), (first non-zero), (first non-zero +1). Then duplicate.\n\nSo for Example0 row1: first non-zero is1. Columns0,1,2 \u21920,8,8. But output triplet is8,8,0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this approach isn't working. I'm stuck.\n\nMaybe the answer is that the output is formed by taking the three middle columns of each non-zero row and duplicating them. For an 8-column row, the middle columns are3,4,5. But in Example0, the first non-zero row's triplet is1-3. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the middle three columns are3,4,5 for all rows. For Example0 row1: columns3,4,5 \u21920,0,0. Not matching.\n\nThis is not working either.\n\nAt this point, I think the only way to proceed is to apply the pattern observed in the training examples to the test input and see what makes sense.\n\nTest Input's non-zero rows are rows4,5,6.\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 first non-zero at3.\n\nRow5: [0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 first non-zero at1.\n\nRow6: [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 first non-zero at1.\n\nLooking at the previous examples, when the first non-zero is at1 (Example0 row1), the triplet is1-3 (columns1,2,3). So for row5 of the test input, triplet is1-3:3,3,3 \u2192 duplicated \u21923,3,3,3,3,3.\n\nFor row4: first non-zero at3. triplet is3-5:3,0,0 \u2192 duplicated \u21923,0,0,3,0,0. But according to Example1 row5, where first non-zero at3, the triplet was columns2-4 (0,2,0). So for row4, triplet would be columns2-4:0,3,0 \u2192 duplicated \u21920,3,0,0,3,0.\n\nFor row6: first non-zero at1. triplet1-3:3,0,0 \u2192 duplicated \u21923,0,0,3,0,0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nBut let's check if this matches the format of the training examples. For Example1's row5, the first non-zero at3 resulted in triplet columns2-4 (0,2,0). So applying the same logic to row4: triplet2-4 (0,3,0) \u2192 duplicated gives0,3,0,0,3,0.\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nWhich matches the style of the training examples.",
