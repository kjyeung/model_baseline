        "cot_1": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern here. Let's look at the training examples first. \n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a lot of 1s forming some kind of shapes. The output replaces certain 0s and 1s with 2s and 7s. Hmm. Let me check where those numbers appear. \n\nIn the output, the 2s are in positions that were 0 in the input but adjacent to 1s. Like in the second row, the two middle elements are 2s. Wait, maybe they are the inner parts of a rectangle formed by 1s. Oh, right! It looks like the 2s are filling the area enclosed by the 1s. Similarly, 7s appear in positions where the original 1s are part of the border but not the outermost layer. Wait, maybe the 1s that form the outer edge stay as 1s, but the inner edges become 7s? Or perhaps the 7s are the perimeter of a shape, and 2s are the inside.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input: The first row is all 1s and 0s. In the output, the second row has 2s where there were 0s between the 1s. For instance, the input row is [1,0,0,1,0,...], and the output is [1,2,2,1,0,...]. So those 0s between the 1s turned into 2s. So maybe the 2s are filling the enclosed areas. \n\nThen, looking at the fourth row of Example 0's output: [1,1,1,1,0,0,1,7,1,0]. The original input here is [1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0]. The 0 in position 7 (index 7) is replaced with 7. That 0 was surrounded by 1s. Maybe when a 0 is surrounded by 1s on multiple sides, it becomes a 7? Or perhaps 7 is used for the perimeter of a shape that's part of a larger structure.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that 2s represent the interior of a closed shape made of 1s, and 7s represent the border (the perimeter) of another shape. But how is that determined?\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a structure where the output replaces some 0s with 2s and some 1s with 7s. For instance, the second row input is [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1], and output is [1,7,1,0,1,2,2,2,2,1]. So the 0 in position 1 (originally a 0) becomes 7, but that's in the same row as the 1s. Wait, maybe the 7s are part of a border that's adjacent to 2s. Alternatively, maybe the 7s are part of the perimeter of a shape, and the 2s are the filled area inside another shape.\n\nAnother approach: let's think of the 1s forming some sort of maze or connected regions. The transformation might involve identifying the borders and filling the enclosed areas. For example, the 2s could be the filled regions inside the 1s, and 7s could be the border of those filled regions. But how is that determined?\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input has a rectangle made of 1s. In the output, the inner 0s (the ones inside the rectangle) are replaced with 7s. Wait, in example 3's input, the second row is [0,1,1,1,0,...], and output has [0,1,7,7,7, etc.]. Wait no, in example 4, the input is a large rectangle. The output replaces the inner 0s with 7s. For example, in rows 2-6, the inner parts (originally 0s) become 7s. Then in another part of the output (like rows 10-13), the inner 0s are replaced with 2s. So perhaps 7s are for one kind of enclosed area and 2s for another. But how to distinguish them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s and 7s depend on the distance from the border. Like, if a 0 is enclosed by 1s and is adjacent to the border of the enclosing 1s, it becomes 7, and if it's deeper inside, it becomes 2. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nWait, let's take example 0 again. The fourth row of the input is [1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0]. The output is [1,1,1,1,0,0,1,7,1,0]. The 0 at position 7 (originally 0) becomes 7. That 0 is between two 1s in the same row and column. Maybe 7s are 0s that are on the edge of an enclosed area, adjacent to 1s. So perhaps the transformation is: for each cell, if it's a 0 and is enclosed by 1s in such a way that it's part of a \"corridor\" or adjacent to a corner, it becomes a 7. And 2s are filled regions.\n\nAlternatively, the 7s are replacing 0s that are on the perimeter of a shape formed by 1s. Wait, but in example 0, the 7 is in a position that was a 0, surrounded by 1s. Maybe 7s are for cells that are adjacent to exactly two 1s in a way that forms a corner. Hmm, that's a bit vague.\n\nAnother angle: the numbers 2 and 7 might be counting something. Like the number of adjacent 1s. But looking at example 0, in the second row, the 2s are in positions where they have 1s on both sides. But in the output, they are 2s. Maybe the 2s are in regions that are enclosed and surrounded by 1s, forming a loop. The 7s might be part of a different kind of enclosure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 0s that are completely enclosed by 1s in all four directions (up, down, left, right), but that doesn't fit example 0. For example, in example 0's row 1 (input: [1,0,0,1,0,...]), the 0s are between 1s, so they are enclosed horizontally but not vertically. But the output replaces them with 2s. So maybe the 2s are areas that are enclosed in a loop of 1s. So the algorithm could be: for each cell that is 0, check if it is enclosed by 1s in such a way that it's part of a closed loop. Then, fill those 0s with 2s, and maybe the borders (the 1s that form the loop) are replaced with 7s if they are part of an inner loop.\n\nWait, but in example 0's output, the 7s are in the 1s. Like in row 3, the original input is [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0], and the output is [1,1,1,1,0,0,1,7,1,0]. Wait no, that's row 3 of the input. The input's row 3 is [1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0]. The output for that row is [1,1,1,1,0,0,1,7,1,0]. So here, the original 0 at position 7 (assuming 0-based index) is replaced with 7. The surrounding cells are 1s to the left (position 6), 1 below (row 4, position 7 is 0 in input?), maybe. Wait, perhaps I need to visualize this as a grid. Let me try to sketch example 0's input and output.\n\nExample 0 input rows (rows 0-9):\n\nRow 0: [1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 1: [1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0]\nRow 3: [1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0]\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]\nRow 5: [1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 6: [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 7: [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 8: [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 9: [1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: same as input.\nRow 1: [1,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [1,2,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,0]\nRow 3: [1,1,1,1,0,0,1,7,1,0]\nRow 4: same as input except the 1s are kept.\nRow 5: same as input.\nRow 6: [1,7,7,7,1,0,...]\nRow 7-8: same as row 6.\nRow 9: same as input.\n\nSo in row 1, the 0s between the 1s (positions 1 and 2) become 2s. So maybe the 2s are the inner area of a rectangle formed by 1s. In row 3, the 0 at position 7 is surrounded by 1s. Let's look at the surrounding cells. Let's imagine the grid:\n\nRow 3 in input: columns 0-9 are [1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0]. The 0 is at column 7. The cells around it: left is 1 (column 6), right is 1 (column 8), above (row 2, column 7) is 1, below (row 4, column7) is 1. So this 0 is completely enclosed by 1s in all four directions. So maybe such cells become 7. Whereas the 2s in rows 1 and 2 are in cells that are enclosed horizontally but not vertically. Wait, but in row1, the 0s (positions 1 and 2) are between 1s in the same row. So maybe 2s are for 0s that are enclosed by 1s in the same row (left and right), but maybe not vertically. Then the 7s are for cells that are enclosed in all four directions. Or perhaps 7s are for 1s that are on the border of a 2-filled area. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 2s are regions that are enclosed by 1s in a loop, and 7s are the borders of such regions. Wait, but in the output, the 7s are replacing 0s in some cases and 1s in others. Wait no, in example 0's output row3, the 7 is in a cell that was originally 0. So 7s are replacing 0s in some cases. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are for cells that are part of a horizontal corridor, surrounded by 1s on left and right. The 7s are for cells that are part of a vertical corridor or a cross. \n\nLooking at example 3's output: the input has a structure where some 0s become 7s. For example, in row2 of example3 input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0], the output is [0,1,7,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0]. So the middle 0 (position2) becomes 7. This 0 is between 1s in the same row. So maybe 7s are in cells where 0s are between 1s in the same row but the vertical positions are also 1s. Or maybe it's a more complex condition.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the 2s and 7s are part of a maze-solving algorithm where 2 represents the path and 7 represents walls, but that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s and 7s could be indicating layers. For example, the outermost layer is 1s, then the next layer is 7s, then the inner part is 2s. Like a contour. But how to determine that.\n\nLooking at example 4's output: in the first rectangle (rows 1-7), the inner 0s are replaced with 7s. Then in the lower rectangle (rows 9-14), the inner 0s are replaced with 2s. So perhaps the difference is in the size or the way they are enclosed. The upper rectangle in example4's input is a large square, and the inner 0s are replaced with 7s, while the lower rectangle has a smaller square where inner 0s become 2s. So maybe 7s are used when the enclosed area is surrounded by a single layer of 1s, and 2s when there's a thicker border. Or perhaps the 7s are for the borders of filled areas. Wait, but in example4's output, the inner part of the upper rectangle is 7s (originally 0s) and the lower rectangle's inner part is 2s. So maybe the 7s are for the first layer of enclosed areas and 2s for the next. But that's not consistent across examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 7s and 2s are determined based on the number of adjacent 1s. For example, a 0 that is adjacent to exactly two 1s becomes a 2, and if adjacent to three or four, becomes a 7. Let's check example0's row1. The 0s in positions 1 and 2 are between 1s (left and right), so adjacent to two 1s. They become 2s. In row3, the 0 at position7 is adjacent to four 1s (up, down, left, right), so becomes 7. That fits. Let's check another example.\n\nExample1's input row1: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1], output [1,7,7,7,1,0,...]. Wait, in example1's input row6, the input is [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0], output is [1,7,7,7,1,0,...]. The 0s in positions1-3. Adjacent to 1 on left and right. So adjacent to two 1s. But they are replaced with 7s. That contradicts the previous hypothesis. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on whether the 0 is part of a horizontal or vertical corridor. For example, if the 0 is between two 1s horizontally, becomes 2. If vertically, becomes 7. But in example0's row3, the 0 at position7 is surrounded by 1s on all sides. So maybe that's a cross, which would be 7. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a different approach. Let's look for the 7s. In example0, the 7 appears in a cell that was a 0, surrounded by 1s on all four sides. Like a single cell surrounded by 1s. In example3's input, the 7 appears in a cell that is between two 1s in the same row. Wait, no. In example3's input row2 is [0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0], and output row2 is [0,1,7,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0]. So the cell in position2 (0) becomes 7. The adjacent cells: left is 1, right is 1, up (row1) is 1 (from input row1 [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], so up is 1. Down (row3) is 1 (input row3 [0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0], position2 is 1. So the cell is between 1s in all four directions. So that fits the pattern where 7 is a 0 surrounded by 1s in all four directions. \n\nThen in example0's row3, the 0 at position7 is surrounded by 1s in all four directions (left, right, up, down). So that's why it's replaced with 7. \n\nBut in example0's row6, the input is [1,0,0,0,1,0,...], output is [1,7,7,7,1,0,...]. The 0s in positions1-3. Are they surrounded by 1s in all four directions? Let's check. For position1 in row6: up is row5's position1 (row5 input is [1,1,1,1,1,0,...], so row5's position1 is 1. Down is row7's position1 (input row7 is [1,0,0,0,1,0,...], so position1 is 0. So that cell (row6, position1) is between 1 above and 1 to the left and right, but below is 0. So not surrounded on all four sides. But in output, it's replaced with 7. So the earlier hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 7s are used when a 0 is part of a vertical or horizontal line between 1s, but not fully enclosed. For example, the middle 0s in a horizontal line of 1s. For example, in example0's row6: the 0s are between 1s on the left and right. But vertically, above and below have 1s? Let's check. Row6 is the 6th row (index 6). The rows above and below:\n\nRow5 (index5) is [1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0], so for position1, it's 1. Row7 (index7) is [1,0,0,0,1,0,...], so position1 is 0. So the cell in row6, position1 is between 1s horizontally (left and right), but vertically only above is 1. So maybe 7s are for 0s that are between 1s horizontally (left and right) but with 1s above. Or some other combination.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's think of another angle. Maybe the 2s and 7s are part of a flood fill algorithm. For example, all 0s that are enclosed by 1s are filled with 2s, and the 1s that form the border are replaced with 7s. But in example0's row1, the 0s are filled with 2s, but the 1s remain. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s that form a certain shape are replaced with 7s if they are part of a corridor or a tunnel. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nLooking back at the test input. Let's see if I can apply any possible pattern.\n\nTest input: a grid with various rectangles made of 1s. Let's look for areas where 0s are enclosed by 1s. For example, rows 0-4: there's a structure at the end (columns 12-16). Row0: [...,1,1,1,1,1], row1: [...,1,0,0,0,1], row2: [...,1,0,0,0,1], row3: [...,1,0,0,0,1], row4: [...,1,1,1,1,1]. So this forms a rectangle. The 0s inside would be filled with 2s or 7s. \n\nIn example0, such a rectangle would have the inner 0s replaced with 2s. But in example4, the inner 0s are replaced with 7s. Wait, no. In example4, the first rectangle (rows1-7) are filled with 7s. The second rectangle (rows9-14) are filled with 2s. So what's the difference between the two? The first is a larger rectangle, the second is smaller. But why the difference? Maybe the algorithm is that if a rectangle is part of a larger structure, it's filled with 7s, otherwise 2s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s and 7s could indicate different layers. For example, the outermost enclosed region is filled with 2s, and inner regions (enclosed within other regions) are filled with 7s. Or vice versa. \n\nIn example0's output, the 2s are in a horizontal corridor (row1-2), and the 7 is in a single cell. Perhaps the 2s are in regions enclosed by 1s but not fully enclosed (like a horizontal tunnel), while 7s are in fully enclosed cells (like a room). \n\nFor the test input, the first enclosed area is the rectangle from rows0-4, columns12-16. The inner 0s here would be replaced with 2s based on example0. But in example4's first rectangle, the inner 0s become 7s. So that's conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 7s are used when the enclosed region is adjacent to the outer 0s. Or perhaps it's based on the distance from the edge of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example1's output: the 7s are in cells that were originally 1s. Wait, no. Let me check example1's input and output.\n\nExample1 input row1: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1], output row1: [1,7,7,7,1,0,...]. So the original 0s between 1s are replaced with 7s. Wait, so in example1, the 0s in row1 positions1-3 are replaced with 7s. Those 0s are between 1s in the same row, but what about vertically? Let's check row0: [1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]. So vertically, the 0s in row1 positions1-3 have a 1 above (row0's position1 is 1). So maybe if a 0 is between 1s horizontally and has 1 above, it becomes a 7, whereas if it's between 1s horizontally and no 1 above, it becomes a 2. \n\nBut in example0's row1, the 0s between 1s have 1 above (row0's same columns are 1s). But in example0's output, those 0s are replaced with 2s, not 7s. So that contradicts.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to find a different pattern. Looking at the 7s in the outputs:\n\n- In example0, row3 has a 7 in a cell that was a 0 surrounded by 1s on all four sides.\n\n- In example1, row1's 0s between 1s in the same row become 7s, but vertically there's a 1 above (row0's same column is 1).\n\n- In example3, row2's middle 0 becomes a 7. This 0 is surrounded by 1s in all four directions.\n\n- In example4's output, the first rectangle's inner 0s become 7s. These 0s are surrounded by 1s on all sides (since it's a rectangle). \n\nBut in example0's row6, the 0s between 1s in the same row (positions1-3) are replaced with 7s. These 0s are between 1s in the same row. What about vertically? Row5 (above) has 1s in those positions (row5 is [1,1,1,1,1,0,...]), so above them is 1. Row7 (below) has 0s. So the 0s in row6 are between 1s horizontally and have a 1 above. So maybe the condition for 7 is that the cell is a 0 and has 1s on left, right, and above. But how about in example1's row1: the 0s have 1s on left, right, and above (row0's same columns are 1s). So they become 7s, which matches. In example0's row1, the 0s are between 1s in the same row and have 1s above (row0's columns are 1s). But in example0's row1 output, they become 2s. So that doesn't fit. \n\nWait, example0's row1 input is [1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is [1,2,2,1,0,0,...]. So the 0s between the 1s in columns1-2 become 2s. But according to the previous hypothesis, they should become 7s because they are between left and right 1s and have 1s above. Because row0's columns1-2 are 1s. So why are they 2s here? That breaks the pattern. \n\nThis suggests that the initial hypothesis is incorrect. Maybe the 2s and 7s are determined based on different criteria. Perhaps 2s are for horizontal corridors, and 7s for vertical corridors. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s are used when the cell is part of a region that is enclosed on all four sides (like a room), and 7s are for cells that are part of a corridor (enclosed on two sides). But this doesn't fit example0's 7 cell which is fully enclosed.\n\nAlternatively, 2s are for filling the area inside a closed loop of 1s, and 7s are for the perimeter of another structure. For example, in example0's row3, the 7 is inside a small 3x3 square (since the 1s form a cross maybe?), and thus part of a different structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers 2 and 7 are arbitrary and represent different levels of nesting. For example, the first enclosed area is filled with 2s, the next enclosed area (inside another) is filled with 7s, etc. But looking at example4's output, the first enclosed area is filled with 7s, and another area with 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compare input and output for cells that become 2 or 7. For example, in example0's row6, the input 0s become 7s. These 0s are between 1s in the same row and have 1s above (row5 is all 1s in columns0-4). So maybe when a 0 is between 1s in the same row and has 1s above, it becomes a 7, and when between 1s in the same row but no 1 above, it becomes a 2. But example0's row1 has 0s between 1s and 1s above, but they become 2s. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the opposite: 2s are when there's a 1 above and below, and 7s when there's a 1 left and right. But not sure.\n\nLooking for a different pattern: maybe the 2s and 7s are determined by the number of adjacent 1s. For example:\n\n- If a 0 cell is adjacent to exactly two 1s (e.g., left and right), it becomes a 2.\n\n- If adjacent to three or four 1s, it becomes a 7.\n\nLet's test this. In example0 row1, the 0s are between two 1s (left and right), so adjacent to two 1s. They become 2s. That fits.\n\nIn example0 row3, the 0 is adjacent to four 1s (left, right, up, down). It becomes a 7. That fits.\n\nIn example0 row6, the 0s are adjacent to two 1s (left and right) and one 1 above. So adjacent to three 1s. According to this hypothesis, they should become 7s. Which they do. That fits.\n\nIn example1's row1, the 0s are between two 1s (left and right), and have a 1 above. So adjacent to three 1s. They become 7s. Which fits.\n\nExample3's row2, the 0 is adjacent to four 1s (left, right, up, down), becomes 7. Fits.\n\nExample4's first rectangle's inner 0s (rows2-6, columns2-6) are adjacent to four 1s (each cell is surrounded by 1s on all sides?), but in the input, the inner 0s are in a large rectangle. Wait, example4's input is a large rectangle (rows1-7) filled with 0s inside. In the output, those 0s become 7s. Each of those 0s is surrounded by 1s on all four sides (since it's a big rectangle). So adjacent to four 1s, which would fit the hypothesis of becoming 7s. \n\nBut in example4's lower rectangle (rows9-14), the inner 0s are surrounded by 1s. Each of those 0s is adjacent to four 1s. But in the output, they become 2s. That contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nSo this approach also fails.\n\nHmm. Another possible angle: the 2s and 7s could represent different types of regions based on their connectivity. For example, 2s are regions connected to the top edge, 7s to the bottom edge. But there's no evidence of that in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be replacing 0s in even-length enclosed areas with 2s and odd-length with 7s. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 7s are replacing 0s that are part of a \"crossroads\" in the maze-like structure, where multiple paths intersect. But again, this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the pattern is as follows: 2s replace 0s that are enclosed horizontally (left and right 1s) but not vertically, and 7s replace 0s that are enclosed vertically (up and down 1s) but not horizontally. Or the opposite. \n\nLet's test this. In example0's row1, the 0s are between left and right 1s (horizontal), so 2s. In example0's row6, the 0s are between left and right 1s and have a 1 above (row5), but not below. So according to this idea, they would be 2s, but in the output they are 7s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: 7s are used when a 0 is part of a T-junction. For example, a cell that has 1s in three directions. Like left, right, and up. Then 7s are for such cells. While 2s are for cells with 1s only left and right. \n\nIn example0's row6, the 0s have 1s left, right, and above. So they become 7s. Which fits. In example0's row1, the 0s have 1s left, right, and above. But in example0's output, they become 2s. So that contradicts. \n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the key is to look at the entire structure and see that the 7s are placed in cells that are part of a certain shape. For example, in example0's row3, the 7 is in a cell that forms the center of a cross made by the 1s. Maybe 7s are used for cells that are part of the intersection of horizontal and vertical corridors. \n\nAlternatively, the 7s are used for cells that are part of a loop that also contains 2s. For instance, the 2s are the filled area, and 7s are the perimeter of that filled area. But then why are some 0s becoming 7s and others 2s?\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that 2s are used to fill regions that are enclosed by 1s in a loop, and 7s are used to mark the perimeter of those regions. So for example, in a rectangle of 1s, the inner 0s are filled with 2s, and the 1s forming the perimeter are replaced with 7s. But in example0's output, the 1s remain as 1s except for some cases. For example, in example0's row6, the 0s are replaced with 7s, but the surrounding 1s are still 1s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s that are part of the perimeter of a filled region become 7s, and the inner 0s become 2s. But again, the examples don't clearly show this.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to proceed, I'll make an educated guess based on the observation that 7s are appearing in 0s that are surrounded by 1s on all four sides, and 2s are in 0s that are between 1s horizontally but not vertically. However, there are exceptions like example0's row6. \n\nBut in example0's row6, the 0s are between 1s in the same row (left and right) and have 1s above (row5), but not below. So perhaps the 7s are for 0s that have 1s in three directions (left, right, and up), and 2s for two directions (left and right). \n\nIf that's the case, then in the test input, let's look for cells that meet these conditions.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,...,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,...,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,...,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,...,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,1,...,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nSo rows0-4 form a rectangle with 1s. The inner cells (row1-3, columns13-15) are 0s. Each of these 0s is surrounded by 1s on all four sides (since it's a closed rectangle). According to previous examples (like example4's first rectangle), these 0s should become 7s. \n\nAnother part of the test input is in row7-16. For example, row7: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. The 1s in columns10 and 12-19 form a vertical line. The cell at row7, column10 is 1. The cells below (row8-16) form another structure. For example, row8: [0,1,0,...,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. The 0s in these rows might be enclosed by 1s and replaced with 2s or 7s based on their adjacency.\n\nAlternatively, the test input's rightmost part (columns17-19) in row7 has a long vertical line of 1s. The cells to the left of that might be enclosed. \n\nBut this is getting too time-consuming. Given the time I have, I'll proceed to apply the pattern where 0s surrounded by 1s on all four sides become 7s, and 0s between 1s horizontally (left and right) become 2s, and between 1s vertically (up and down) become 7s. But this is a bit of a guess.\n\nFor the test input's first rectangle (rows0-4, columns12-16), the inner 0s are surrounded by 1s on all four sides, so they would become 7s. \n\nFor the lower part of the test input, like rows7-16, there are some enclosed areas. For example, row12-15 form a rectangle with 1s. The inner 0s there would be surrounded by 1s on all sides and become 7s or 2s based on example4, which has a lower rectangle filled with 2s.\n\nBut in example4, the lower rectangle's inner 0s are filled with 2s. So perhaps the test input's lower structure (rows12-15) would have their inner 0s replaced with 2s. \n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to generate the output based on these observations.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a grid of 0s and 1s, and the output replaces some of the 0s with 2s or 7s. Hmm. Let's see.\n\nFirst, in Example 0, the output has 2s where there are 0s in the input but are adjacent to 1s, maybe? Like in the second row, the 0s between the 1s become 2s. And then there's a 7 in the fourth row, middle. Wait, maybe 7s are when the cell is inside a square of 1s. Like, the innermost part. For example, in the input of Example 0, the middle part that's surrounded by 1s becomes 7. Similarly, in Example 1, the 7 is in the center of a 3x3 square.\n\nWait, perhaps the 2s represent the border of a shape, and 7s are the inner parts. Let me check. For instance, in Example 0's input, the first row is all 1s, so the output remains the same. Then the next rows have 0s between 1s. Those 0s turn into 2s. Then, in the fourth row, the 0 at position 7 becomes a 7. Looking at the input, that's inside a square of 1s. So maybe 7s are the inner cells of a rectangle or square formed by 1s, and 2s are the border cells.\n\nWait, but in Example 1's input, the second row has a 0 in the second position (after the first 1) which becomes a 7. The surrounding 1s form a kind of U-shape, so maybe that's part of an inner area. Hmm. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is replacing 0s that are inside a closed loop of 1s with 7s, and 0s adjacent to 1s (but on the edge) with 2s. For example, if a 0 is surrounded by 1s on all four sides (north, south, east, west), then it becomes a 7. And if a 0 is on the edge of a 1 structure, like next to a 1 but not fully enclosed, it becomes a 2. That might explain the 2s and 7s.\n\nLet me check Example 0. The fourth row of the output has a 7 in the 7th position (assuming index starts at 0). The input here is [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. So the 7 is where the original 0 is. The surrounding cells are 1s above and below, but maybe in the larger structure. Wait, looking at the input rows:\n\nRow 3: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRow 4: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nSo in row 4, the cell at position 7 (0-based index 7) is 0. The cells around it: above (row3, same column) is 1 (from row3's [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0], so row3, column7 is 1). Below is row5's cell 7, which is 1. Left is cell6 in row4, which is 1. Right is cell8 in row4, which is 1. So this 0 is surrounded by 1s on all four sides (up, down, left, right), so maybe that's why it's a 7. The 2s in other rows might be 0s that are adjacent to 1s but not fully enclosed.\n\nSo the rule could be: for each 0 in the input, if it is enclosed by 1s in all four directions (up, down, left, right), then replace with 7. If it is adjacent (any direction) to a 1 but not enclosed, replace with 2. Otherwise, remains 0.\n\nWait, but looking at Example 1's output. The second row of the output is [1,7,1,0,1,2,2,2,2,1]. The input here was [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1]. The 0 in position 1 (original input) becomes 7. Looking at surrounding cells: up is row0, which is 1. Down is row2's same column, which is 1. Left is 1 (same row, position 0), right is position2 which is 1. So that 0 is surrounded by 1s in all four directions. So that's why it's 7. Then the 0s in positions 5-8 (input row1) become 2s. Those 0s are adjacent to 1s on the left (position4 is 1) but not surrounded. So they become 2s.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the transformation is:\n\n- For each cell in the input grid:\n\n   - If the cell is 0:\n\n      - Check if all four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are 1. If yes, replace with 7.\n\n      - Else, if any adjacent cell (including diagonally?) is 1, replace with 2.\n\n      - Otherwise, remain 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's row1, the input is [1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is [1,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 0s in positions1 and 2 are adjacent to 1s (left and right). So they become 2s. The 0 in position4 is adjacent to 1 (left is 1 in position3), but in the output, it's 0. Wait, that's confusing. Wait in row1, the input is [1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output's row1 is [1,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the first 0s (positions1,2) are between 1s (left and right), so they are adjacent to 1s. But position4's 0 is next to 1 (position3 is 1), but in output, it remains 0. So maybe adjacency isn't the only factor. Wait, perhaps the 2s are the borders of regions. Maybe the 0s that are on the edge of a 1 region become 2s, and the 0s that are enclosed (all four directions) become 7s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 2s are the perimeter (the outline) of the 1s, and 7s are the inner parts. So like a flood fill where 1 is the outer edge, 2 is the next layer, and 7 is the innermost. But the examples don't show multiple layers. Wait, in Example 0's output row3, the 7 is surrounded by 1s. But in Example 2's output, there are multiple layers of 2s. For instance, in row 3 of the output, [1, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]. So the 2s are adjacent to the 1s. Then, the 7s are inside.\n\nWait, perhaps the 2s are the immediate neighbors (like a border) of 1s. So any 0 that is adjacent to a 1 (any direction) becomes 2, but if it's also surrounded by 1s (all four directions) then it becomes 7. But that would mean that 7s are a subset of 2s. But in the examples, 7s are not 2s, so maybe the order is: first check if it's enclosed (all four directions 1s) then replace with 7. If not, check if adjacent to any 1s, then replace with 2. Otherwise, 0.\n\nSo the steps for each 0 cell would be:\n\n1. Check if all four directions (up, down, left, right) are 1. If yes, set to 7.\n\n2. Else, check if any of the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are 1. If yes, set to 2.\n\n3. Else, remain 0.\n\nWait, let's test this with Example 0.\n\nTake the cell in row1, column1 (0-based). The input is 0. Up is row0, column1: 1. Down is row2, column1: 0. Left is row1, column0:1. Right is row1, column2:0. So up is 1, down is 0, left is 1, right is 0. So not all four directions. So since it has adjacent 1s (up and left), it becomes 2. Which matches the output.\n\nIn row3, column7 (output 7). Up is row2, column7: 1. Down is row4, column7:1. Left is row3, column6:1. Right is row3, column8:1. So all four directions are 1. So becomes 7.\n\nAnother example: Example 1, row1, column1 (0-based). Input is 0. Up is row0, column1:1. Down is row2, column1:1. Left is row1, column0:1. Right is row1, column2:1. So all four directions are 1. So it becomes 7, which matches the output.\n\nSo this rule seems to hold.\n\nLet's check another example. Take Example 4's input. The output has 7s in the inner parts of the square. For instance, in row2, the input is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Output becomes [0,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Each of those 0s is surrounded by 1s? Let's see. For row2, column2: input is 0. Up is row1, column2:0. So that's not 1. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the directions. Wait, perhaps the directions are up, down, left, right. If the cell is in row2, column2, then up is row1, column2. If that's 0 (from input row1, which is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]), then up is 0. So how does that cell become 7? That contradicts the rule.\n\nWait, this suggests that my initial hypothesis is wrong. Let me check Example 4's input and output again.\n\nIn Example 4's input, the second row is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output's row2 is [0,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So all the 0s between the 1s in columns1 and 7 are replaced with 7s. But according to the earlier rule, those cells would need to have all four directions as 1. Let's take row2, column3 (original input is 0). Up is row1, column3: which is 0. So that direction is 0, so according to the previous rule, this cell shouldn't be 7. But it is. So my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Let's think again. Maybe the direction checks are not just the immediate adjacent cells but maybe within a larger context, like being part of a closed loop. Alternatively, maybe the 7s are part of the inner area of a rectangle of 1s. For example, if you have a rectangle of 1s forming a border, the 0s inside are replaced with 7s, and the 0s adjacent to the border are 2s.\n\nIn Example 4, the first rectangle is a big rectangle. The input rows 1 to 7 form a rectangle. The inner 0s (rows 2-6, columns 2-6) are replaced with 7s. Then, later in the input, there's another smaller rectangle. The inner 0s there are replaced with 2s. So perhaps the pattern is that for any rectangle (closed loop) formed by 1s, the inner 0s are replaced with 7s if they are part of the inner area, and the 0s adjacent to the borders (but not part of an inner area) are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to define the inner area. Maybe using a flood fill approach. The 0s that are enclosed by 1s in all directions (so they can't reach the grid's edge without crossing a 1) become 7s. The 0s adjacent to 1s but not enclosed become 2s. But how to compute that without actual code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 7s are the 0s that are part of the interior of a hollow square. For example, in a square made of 1s with a hollow inside, the 0s in the hollow are replaced with 7s, and the 0s on the border (edges) of the square become 2s.\n\nWait, in Example 4's input, the first big rectangle is a hollow square. The outer layer is 1s, and inside is all 0s. These 0s are replaced with 7s. Then, the second smaller square has 1s as borders, and the inner 0s are replaced with 2s. Hmm, but why the difference? Because the first hollow square is larger, and the second is smaller. Maybe the 7s are for hollow squares that have a certain minimal size (like at least 3x3?), but the second example's inner square is 3x3, and the inner 0s are 2s. Wait, no, in Example 4's second square, the input has rows 9-14 with a square. The output for rows 10-13, column7 is 2. For example, row10, column7 is 0 in input and becomes 2. So that's part of the border. Wait, maybe the 7s are for the innermost 0s of a multi-layered structure. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for common patterns across all examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the 7 is in the center of a cross-like structure. The input in row3 is [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. The output's row3 is [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 7, 1, 0]. So the 7 is at position7. The surrounding cells (up, down, left, right) are 1s. But in the input, that cell is 0. So it's surrounded by 1s on all four sides, hence 7. The 2s are adjacent to 1s but not enclosed.\n\nIn Example 3's input, the third row is [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]. The output's third row is [0, 1, 7, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]. The cell at position2 (original 0) is surrounded by 1s: up (row2, position2's up is row1, position2: which in input is 0. Wait, that can't be. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the rows and columns mixed up.\n\nWait, let's get back to Example 3. The input row2 is [0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0]. The output row2 is [0,1,7,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0]. So the 7 is in column2. Checking the surrounding cells: up is row1, column2: input row1 is [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So row1, column2 is 1. Down is row3, column2: input row3 is [0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]. Column2 is 1. Left is row2, column1: 1. Right is row2, column3:1. So all four directions are 1s, so becomes 7. That fits the previous rule.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: for any 0 cell, if all four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are 1, then replace with 7. Else, if any adjacent cell (up, down, left, right) is 1, replace with 2. Otherwise, 0.\n\nBut in Example 4's input, the big rectangle's inner 0s are replaced with 7s. Let's take a cell in row2, column2 (input is 0). The up cell is row1, column2, which is 1. Down is row3, column2, which is 0. So according to the rule, this cell wouldn't be 7 because down is 0. But in the output, it is 7. So this contradicts the rule.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that the initial hypothesis is incorrect. So I need to think differently.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 7s are part of the hollow inside a rectangle, regardless of adjacent cells. For example, any 0 that is enclosed by 1s forming a rectangle. So if a 0 is inside a rectangle of 1s (even if the adjacent cells are not all 1s), then it's a 7.\n\nBut how to define the rectangle. For example, in Example 4's input, the first big rectangle is from row1 to row7, columns1 to7. Inside that, all 0s are replaced with 7s, regardless of their adjacent cells. Then, the second square is from row9 to row14, column6 to column12. The inner 0s here are replaced with 2s. Wait, but in that case, perhaps the 7s are for the innermost area of a larger rectangle, and 2s are for smaller areas. That doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 7s are for cells that are in the \"interior\" of a closed shape made by 1s, and 2s are for cells on the perimeter. But how to determine interior vs perimeter.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the outputs, the 7s often form a cross or a single cell in the center. Maybe the 7s are for cells that are at the intersection of horizontal and vertical 1 lines. For example, in Example 0's output row3, the 7 is where the vertical and horizontal lines of 1s cross.\n\nBut how does that apply to other examples. In Example 3's output, the 7 is in a cell that's part of a vertical and horizontal line of 1s. Maybe the rule is that a 0 becomes a 7 if it's where a vertical line and horizontal line of 1s cross, and otherwise, adjacent 1s become 2.\n\nBut in Example 4's big rectangle, the inner cells are all 7s. So this would require that each of those inner cells is part of a cross, which is not the case. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's look for the number of neighboring 1s. Maybe if a 0 has four 1s in its four adjacent cells, it becomes 7. If it has two or three 1s, it becomes 2. But in Example 0, the 7 has four 1s. The 2s in Example 0's row1 have two 1s (left and right). But in Example 0's row3, the 7 is surrounded by four 1s. So this might work. Let's check Example 4's cell at row2, column2. The neighboring cells: up is 1 (row1, column2). Down is row3, column2: which is 0. Left is row2, column1:1. Right is row2, column3:0. So only two 1s. But in the output, it's 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests the initial approach isn't correct. Maybe the pattern is more complex. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output, the 0s that are between 1s in the same row become 2s, and the single 0 surrounded by 1s becomes 7. So maybe 2s are 0s that are part of a \"corridor\" between 1s in the same row or column, and 7s are isolated 0s surrounded by 1s.\n\nBut in Example 4's case, the 7s are part of a larger enclosed area. So maybe 7s are any 0s enclosed by 1s in a rectangular shape. For example, in a rectangle of 1s, the 0s inside are replaced with 7s, and the 0s adjacent to the rectangle's outer edge are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the rectangle. Perhaps the code identifies regions of 1s forming rectangles and replaces the inner 0s with 7s. But how to do that without knowing the code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to replace the 0s that are inside a closed loop of 1s with 7s, and the 0s that are adjacent to 1s (but not enclosed) with 2s. The closed loop could be any shape, not just rectangles. But determining that without code is tricky.\n\nLooking at Example 4's output, the inner part of the big rectangle (rows2-6, columns2-6) are all 7s. The input for these cells are 0s. So they are surrounded by 1s forming a rectangle. So perhaps the rule is that any 0 that is inside a rectangular region bounded by 1s on all four sides (top, bottom, left, right) becomes a 7. The 0s adjacent to the 1s (but part of the perimeter) become 2s.\n\nWait, but in Example 4's output, the inner 0s of the big rectangle are 7s, and the inner 0s of the smaller rectangle (rows10-13, columns7-11) are 2s. So why the difference?\n\nBecause the smaller rectangle's inner 0s are not enclosed on all four sides. For example, in row10, column7, the input is 0. Let's see if it's enclosed by 1s. Up is row9, column7:1. Down is row11, column7:0. Left is row10, column6:1. Right is row10, column8:0. So only up and left are 1s. So according to the previous rule (enclosed on all four sides), it's not a 7. So it becomes a 2, which matches the output.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: for a 0 cell, if there exists a rectangle of 1s such that the cell is inside the rectangle (not on the edge), then replace with 7. Otherwise, if adjacent to any 1, replace with 2. So, the 7s are the inner area of a rectangle, and 2s are the border.\n\nBut how to define the rectangle. This seems complicated. Maybe the code finds all enclosed regions (like lakes) and replaces them with 7s if they are fully enclosed, and the 0s on the coast are 2s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 7s are for 0s that are enclosed in all four directions (have 1s in all four directions), but not necessarily adjacent. For example, a 0 is enclosed by 1s to the north, south, east, and west, but not necessarily immediately adjacent. For example, if there's a 0 that is somewhere in the middle of a large rectangle of 1s.\n\nBut then in Example 4's big rectangle, the inner 0s are all 7s. So for a 0 in the center of the rectangle, to the north, south, east, west there are 1s. So according to this rule, those 0s would become 7s. The 0s adjacent to the rectangle's walls would have at least one direction where there's a 0 (the outside), so they become 2s. But in Example 4's big rectangle, all inner 0s are 7s. So how to determine if a 0 is enclosed.\n\nWait, this is similar to the concept of \"enclosed\" in a grid. An enclosed region is a set of cells that are surrounded by 1s such that there's no path to the edge of the grid. So, the 0s in enclosed regions become 7s, and the 0s adjacent to 1s but part of the unenclosed regions (like along the border) become 2s.\n\nYes! That makes sense. So the pattern is:\n\n- For each 0 in the input:\n\n   - If it is part of an enclosed region (completely surrounded by 1s, no path to the grid's edge), replace with 7.\n\n   - Else, if it is adjacent to any 1 (even diagonally?), replace with 2.\n\n   - Else, remains 0.\n\nThis would explain the examples. For instance, in Example 4's big rectangle, the inner 0s are enclosed and become 7s. The smaller rectangle's inner 0s are not enclosed (because the rectangle is not closed on all sides, or because there's a path to the edge?), so they become 2s. Wait, but in the smaller rectangle's case, the 0s are inside a 3x3 square. For example, in row10, column7 of Example 4's input, the cell is 0. The surrounding 1s form a square. However, if the entire grid is considered, perhaps there's a path to the edge. For example, if the square is connected to the edge via other 1s. But in Example 4's case, the smaller square is in the lower part, perhaps not connected to the edge. Wait, this is getting complicated without seeing the full grid.\n\nBut let's think about Example 4's test input. The smaller square is in rows9-14, columns6-12. The output for row10 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]. So the inner 0s of the smaller square become 2s, suggesting they are not enclosed. Maybe because they are connected to the edge via other paths. For example, if the smaller square's 1s are connected to the larger square's 1s, allowing a path to the edge. But without seeing the entire grid, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, the code treats any 0 that is adjacent to a 1 as 2, and any 0 that is enclosed (even if in a small square) as 7. So the key is whether the 0 is enclosed.\n\nBut how to determine enclosed regions without code. This is challenging, but perhaps the pattern is that any 0 that is enclosed by 1s in all four directions (immediate neighbors) becomes 7, otherwise, adjacent to 1 becomes 2.\n\nBut that brings us back to the initial hypothesis, which didn't fit Example 4's case. So maybe there's another layer.\n\nAlternative Idea: Looking at the examples, the 7s are always single cells or inner parts of a rectangle. The 2s are along the edges. For instance, in Example 4's big rectangle, all inner 0s are 7s. So perhaps the rule is: for a 0, if it is inside a rectangle of 1s that is at least 3x3, then replace with 7. If it's inside a smaller rectangle, replace with 2. But how to determine that.\n\nIn Example 4's big rectangle (rows1-7, columns1-7), the 0s inside are replaced with 7s. The rectangle is 7 rows tall and 7 columns wide, so definitely larger than 3x3. The smaller rectangle (rows9-14, columns6-12) is 5 rows tall and 7 columns wide. But the inner 0s are replaced with 2s. This doesn't fit. So this idea is not correct.\n\nHmm. This is getting frustrating. Let me think of another approach. \n\nLooking at the examples, the 2s often form a border around the 1s, and 7s are isolated inside. So perhaps the algorithm is:\n\n1. Replace all 0s that are adjacent to any 1 (even diagonally?) with 2.\n\n2. Then, among those 2s, replace any 2 that is completely enclosed by 1s and/or 2s with 7.\n\nBut how would that work. For Example 0's row3, the 7 is surrounded by 1s, so after step 1, it's a 2. Then step 2 replaces it with 7. But in other cells, like the 2s in row1, they are not enclosed by 1s/2s, so they remain 2.\n\nBut this requires two passes. First, replace adjacent 0s with 2, then replace enclosed 2s with 7.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0. \n\nInput row3: [1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0]. \n\nStep 1: Replace 0s adjacent to 1s with 2. \n\nThe 0 in position4: adjacent to 1 (position3 is 1). So becomes 2.\n\nThe 0 in position5: adjacent to 1 (position4 is now 2). Hmm, but this depends on processing order. Maybe during the first pass, it's only considering original 1s. So the 0s that are adjacent to original 1s become 2s. Then, in a second pass, 2s that are enclosed by 1s become 7s.\n\nFor example, in row3, the 0 at position7 is adjacent to 1s (left is 1, right is 1, up is 1, down is 1). So in step 1, it's adjacent to 1s and becomes 2. Then, in step 2, check if this 2 is enclosed by 1s in all four directions. Yes, so it becomes 7.\n\nThe other 0s in row3 (positions4 and 5) are adjacent to 1s (position3 and 6). So they become 2s. But since they are not enclosed by 1s on all sides, they remain 2s.\n\nThis might work. Let's see Example 4's big rectangle. The inner 0s are adjacent to 1s (step 1, they become 2s). Then, since they are enclosed by 1s (step 2), they become 7s. For the smaller rectangle, the inner 0s are adjacent to 1s (step 1, become 2s). But they are not enclosed by 1s in all four directions. For example, the cell in row10, column7: up is 1 (row9), down is 0 (row11, which is 0 in input and becomes 2 in step1). So during step2, this 2 is not enclosed by 1s on all four sides (down is 2). So it remains 2.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\n1. For each 0 in the input grid, if it is adjacent (including diagonally?) to any 1, replace it with 2.\n\n2. For each 2 in the grid, if all four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are 1s or 2s, replace it with 7.\n\nWait, no. Because step1 would have converted some 0s to 2s. Then, step2 would check if those 2s are completely surrounded by 1s or 2s. But in Example 0's case, the 7 is a 2 from step1, and in step2, it's surrounded by 1s. So it becomes 7.\n\nIn Example 4's big rectangle, after step1, all inner 0s are 2s. Then, in step2, those 2s are surrounded by other 2s and/or 1s. For example, a cell in the center of the big rectangle would have up, down, left, right as 2s (from step1). So step2 would check if all four directions are 1s or 2s. If yes, replace with 7. But in this case, the four directions are 2s. So the cell would be replaced with 7. But this would cause a chain reaction. For example, after the first layer of 2s become 7s, the next layer would now have adjacent 7s and 1s, so they would also become 7s. This could fill the entire enclosed area with 7s.\n\nBut how to avoid that. Alternatively, perhaps step2 checks if all four directions are 1s (original 1s), then replace with 7.\n\nWait, but that brings us back to the initial rule: 7 is only when all four directions are 1s. But Example 4's big rectangle's inner cells don't have all four directions as 1s, but they are replaced with 7s.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the algorithm is:\n\n1. For each 0 cell, if any of its eight neighbors (including diagonal) is a 1, replace with 2.\n\n2. For each 2 cell, if all of its four neighbors (up, down, left, right) are 1s or 2s, replace with 7.\n\nBut then in Example 4's big rectangle, after step1, the inner 0s are 2s. Then, in step2, check if those 2s are surrounded by 1s or 2s. Since they are in the center, they would be surrounded by 2s, so replaced with 7. Then, the next layer of 2s would now be surrounded by 7s and 1s, which would also be replaced with 7. This would fill the entire enclosed area with 7s, which matches the output.\n\nFor Example 4's smaller rectangle, after step1, the inner 0s become 2s. But their neighbors include 0s (which become 2s) and possibly 1s. However, if the smaller rectangle is connected to the edge via other paths, the 2s might not be enclosed.\n\nBut I'm not sure. This is getting complex. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis based on the examples, which seems to hold for most cases. So the rule is: replace 0s with 2 if adjacent to any 1, then replace 2s with 7 if all four directions are 1s.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps the best approach is to code the following:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid:\n\n- If the cell is 0:\n\n   - Check if it's enclosed by 1s in all four directions (up, down, left, right). If yes, replace with 7.\n\n   - Else, if it's adjacent (up, down, left, right) to any 1, replace with 2.\n\n   - Else, leave as 0.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nThe test input is a grid of 20 rows and 20 columns. The rows provided are:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow8: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow9: [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow11: [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow12: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow13: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow14: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow15: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow16: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow17: [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow18: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow19: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nNow, we need to process each cell.\n\nLet's start with the cells in the upper-left structure. For example, row2 is a line of 1s forming part of a square. The square seems to be from row2 to row9, columns1 to8. The inner cells (rows3-8, columns2-7) are 0s. Let's check if they are enclosed by 1s in all four directions.\n\nTake row3, column2 (0-based). The cell is 0. Up is row2, column2:1. Down is row4, column2:0. Left is row3, column1:1. Right is row3, column3:0. So not all four directions are 1. So this cell should become 2.\n\nBut according to the rule, since it's adjacent to 1s (up and left), it becomes 2. But if the down cell is 0, then the cell isn't enclosed. So it's a 2.\n\nRow4, column2: cell is 0. Up is row3, column2:0 (input). Down is row5, column2:0. Left is row4, column1:1. Right is row4, column3:0. So adjacent to left 1. Becomes 2.\n\nNow, looking for cells that are enclosed. For example, row8, column9 (assuming rows and columns are 0-based). Not sure. Maybe look for cells surrounded by 1s in all directions.\n\nLooking at row7, column10 (0-based). The cell is 1. Not relevant.\n\nLet's check row8, column10 (cell is 1). Not relevant.\n\nLooking at row8, column14 (cell is 0 in input). No, row8 is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. So column14 is 0. Up is row7, column14:1. Down is row9, column14:0. Left is row8, column13:0. Right is row8, column15:0. So this cell is 0. Up is 1, others are 0. So adjacent to 1 (up). Becomes 2. Not enclosed.\n\nAnother example: row8, column11. Input is 0. Up is row7, column11:1 (since row7's columns 10-19 are [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], so column11 is 1. Down is row9, column11:1. Left is row8, column10:1. Right is row8, column12:0. So this cell is 0 in input. Adjacent to up, down, left 1s. So becomes 2. But since right is 0, it's not enclosed. So remains 2.\n\nAnother candidate for 7: row8, column17. Wait, not sure. Let's look for a cell that is surrounded by 1s in all four directions.\n\nLooking at row10, column17. Input is 0. Up is row9, column17:0. Down is row11, column17:0. Left is row10, column16:0. Right is row10, column18:0. Not adjacent to any 1s. So remains 0.\n\nLooking at row8, column18. Input is 0. Up is row7, column18:1 (part of the long line of 1s in row7). Down is row9, column18:1 (row9 is [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. Column18 is 0. So down is 0. So cell is adjacent to up 1. Becomes 2. Not enclosed.\n\nNow, looking for a cell that is surrounded by 1s in all four directions. For example, row8, column14: cell is 0. Up is row7, column14:1. Down is row9, column14:0. Left is row8, column13:0. Right is row8, column15:0. So only up is 1. So becomes 2.\n\nAnother example: row3, column7. Input is 0. Up is row2, column7:1. Down is row4, column7:0. Left is row3, column6:0. Right is row3, column8:1. So up and right are 1s. Adjacent to 1s, becomes 2. Not enclosed.\n\nPerhaps there's a cell in the lower part of the grid. For example, row12, column17. Input is 0. Up is row11, column17:0. Down is row13, column17:0. Left is row12, column16:0. Right is row12, column18:0. Not adjacent to 1s. So remains 0.\n\nHmm, maybe the test input has a few enclosed cells. Let's look at row8, column11 again. The input is 0. Adjacent to up (row7, column11:1), down (row9, column11:1), left (row8, column10:1), right (row8, column12:0). So three directions are 1. But right is 0. So not all four directions. So becomes 2.\n\nAnother candidate: row7, column10. Input is 1. Not relevant.\n\nHow about row8, column9: cell is 0. Up is row7, column9:0 (row7 is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. So column9 is 0. Down is row9, column9:0. Left is row8, column8:1. Right is row8, column10:1. So adjacent to left and right 1s. Becomes 2. Not enclosed.\n\nPerhaps in the lower part, the cells in rows 12-15, columns 17-19. Looking at row12, column17:0. Up is row11, column17:0. Down is row13, column17:0. Left is row12, column16:0. Right is row12, column18:0. Not adjacent to 1s. So remains 0.\n\nWait, perhaps there are no enclosed 0s in the test input, so all 0s adjacent to 1s become 2s. But looking at Example 0, the 7 is present. So there must be at least one cell in the test input that is enclosed.\n\nLooking at row9, column10: cell is 1. Not relevant.\n\nLooking at row8, column11: cell is 0. As before, adjacent to three 1s, becomes 2.\n\nLooking at row7, column16: cell is 1. Not relevant.\n\nLooking at row16, column16: cell is 0. Up is row15, column16:0. Down is row17, column16:0. Left is row16, column15:0. Right is row16, column17:0. Not adjacent to 1s. So remains 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps there are no 7s in the test input. But that's unlikely given the examples. Alternatively, perhaps there are cells that are enclosed.\n\nLet's look at row8, column11. Input is 0. Up: row7, column11 is 1 (row7's columns 10-19 are 1s). Down: row9, column11 is 1 (row9's column11:0. Wait, row9 is [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. So column11 is 0. So down is 0. So cell is not enclosed.\n\nWhat about row8, column14. Input is 0. Up is row7, column14:1. Down is row9, column14:0. Left is row8, column13:0. Right is row8, column15:0. So adjacent to up 1. Becomes 2.\n\nAnother area to check: row7's columns 10-19 are all 1s. So in row8, columns10-19, some are 1s and others are 0s. For example, row8, column10:1. Row8, column11:0. Column12:0. Column13:0. ... Column19:1.\n\nRow8: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nSo cells in row8, columns11-18 are 0s. Are any of them enclosed by 1s?\n\nTake row8, column12:0. Up is row7, column12:1. Down is row9, column12:0. Left is row8, column11:0. Right is row8, column13:0. So up is 1, others are 0. So becomes 2.\n\nHow about row9, columns10-19: row9 is [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. So column10 is 1. Columns11-18 are 0s. Column19 is 1.\n\nSo cells in row9, columns11-18:0. For example, row9, column15:0. Up is row8, column15:0. Down is row10, column15:0. Left is row9, column14:0. Right is row9, column16:0. No adjacent 1s. So remains 0.\n\nAnother area: row7, columns10-19 are all 1s. row8, column10:1. row8, column19:1. So the 0s between them in row8 are surrounded by 1s on left (column10), right (column19), up (row7's columns11-18 are 1s). So, for example, row8, column11:0. Up is row7, column11:1. Down is row9, column11:0. Left is 1 (column10). Right is 0 (column12). So adjacent to up and left 1s. So becomes 2. But down and right are 0s. So not enclosed.\n\nBut wait, in row8, columns10-19, the 0s are between 1s in column10 and column19, and up row7's columns10-19 are 1s. So the cells in row8, columns11-18 are 0s. Down for these cells is row9's columns11-18:0. So the 0s are surrounded by 1s on up, left (column10), right (column19), but not down. So these 0s are not enclosed.\n\nSo according to the initial rule, no 7s would be generated here.\n\nBut perhaps there's another area. For example, in the lower part of the grid. Let's look at rows 12-15, columns 0-7. \n\nRow12: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow13: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow14: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow15: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow16: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nThese rows form a structure where columns7 is 1 in rows12-16. Columns0-6: row12 is 0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,... So in row12, column7 is 1. The cells in rows12-15, columns7-19 may form a structure. For example, in row15, columns7 is 1. Columns8-18 are 0s. Column19 is 1.\n\nBut I'm not seeing any enclosed cells. \n\nAfter a thorough analysis, it seems that in the test input, there are no 0s that are enclosed by 1s in all four directions. Therefore, all 0s adjacent to 1s would become 2s, and no 7s would be present.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, especially Example 0 and Example 3, there are 7s when there's a single cell enclosed. So perhaps there is a cell in the test input that is enclosed.\n\nLet me recheck the test input. \n\nLooking at row7, columns10-19 are all 1s. Row8, column10 is 1, column19 is 1. Row9, column10 is 1, column19 is 1. So between rows7-9, columns10-19, there's a rectangle of 1s. The cells in row8, columns11-18:0s. These 0s are surrounded by 1s on top (row7), bottom (row9), left (column10), and right (column19). So all four directions are 1s. So according to the initial rule, these 0s should become 7s.\n\nAh! This is the key. The 0s in row8, columns11-18 are surrounded by 1s on all four sides. \n\nFor example, row8, column11:0. Up is row7, column11:1. Down is row9, column11:0. Wait, no. Row9's column11 is 0. So down is 0. So not all four directions. \n\nWait, no. Let's look at the actual data:\n\nRow7 is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. So columns10-19 are 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1.\n\nRow8 is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. So column10 is 1, columns11-18 are 0s, column19 is 1.\n\nRow9 is [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. Column10 is 1, columns11-18 are 0s, column19 is 1.\n\nRow10 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. Column10 is 1, others are 0.\n\nWait, so the cells in row8, columns11-18 are 0s. Up is row7, columns11-18: all 1s. Down is row9, columns11-18:0s. Left is column10:1. Right is column19:1. So for these cells in row8, columns11-18:\n\nUp is 1, down is 0, left is 1, right is 1. So the down direction is 0, which means the cell is not enclosed. So according to the rule, they are adjacent to 1s (up, left, right), so become 2s, but not 7s.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. For example, row8, column11 is 0. Up is 1 (row7, column11). Down is row9, column11:0. So down is 0. So not all four directions. So becomes 2.\n\nBut there is another area. Look at row7, column10-19 are all 1s. Row8, column10 is 1, column19 is 1. Row9, column10 is 1, column19 is 1. So between rows7-9, columns10-19, there's a rectangle of 1s. The cells in row8, columns11-18 are 0s. But down is row9's columns11-18 which are 0s. So they are not enclosed.\n\nWait, but perhaps in row9, columns11-18 are 0s. So the cell in row8, column11 is part of a vertical column that is surrounded by 1s on left (column10) and right (column19), but not on top and bottom. So no enclosed cells here.\n\nAnother possibility: looking at row8, column10:1. Row8, column19:1. Row7's columns10-19 are 1s. Row9's columns10 and 19 are 1s. So the 0s in row8, columns11-18 are between the 1s in columns10 and 19, and under row7's 1s. But row9's columns11-18 are 0s, so the down direction is 0. So no enclosure.\n\nHmm. This is quite challenging. After extensive analysis, I think the test input may not have any enclosed 0s, so all changes would be to 2s. However, looking at the training examples, especially Example 3, there's a single 7 in a small enclosed area. \n\nAlternatively, there may be an enclosed area in the test input that I'm missing. For example, looking at rows7-9, columns10-19, the cells in row8, columns11-18 are surrounded by 1s on three sides (left, right, up), but not down. So they are not enclosed.\n\nBut perhaps there's another area. Let's look at rows10-16, columns10-19. For example, row16's columns10-19: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. So columns10-19 are 1s. Rows10-15, column10 is 1. Row10, column10:1. Rows11-15, column10:0. So no. For example, row10's column10:1. Row11's column10:0.\n\nAnother area: rows7-16, column10. Column10 has 1s in rows7,8,9,10,16. So in rows11-15, column10 is 0.\n\nSo no enclosed areas there.\n\nAfter this detailed analysis, I think the test input does not have any cells that are enclosed by 1s in all four directions. Therefore, all 0s adjacent to 1s are replaced with 2s, and no 7s are present. \n\nHowever, looking at the training examples, each example has at least one 7. So perhaps there is at least one 7 in the test input. But based on the analysis, I can't find any. \n\nBut maybe I made a mistake. Let's check row4, column14. Row4's input is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]. The cell at column14 is 1. Not relevant.\n\nAnother idea: looking at row7, column10:1. Row8, column10:1. Row9, column10:1. Row10, column10:1. Row11, column10:0. So between rows7-10, column10 is 1. But row11's column10 is 0. So no enclosure.\n\nAnother possibility is in row8, columns0-9. For example, row8, column8:1. The cells around it: up is row7, column8:1. Down is row9, column8:1. Left is row8, column7:0. Right is row8, column9:0. So not enclosed.\n\nAfter all this, I'm convinced that the test input's output will have 2s where 0s are adjacent to 1s, and no 7s. However, this contradicts the training examples where 7s are present. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis. Let's check row4, column15. Input is 1. Not relevant.\n\nWait, let's consider the structure in the test input's upper part. Rows0-9 have a structure that may form an enclosed area. For example, rows0-4, columns12-16.\n\nRow0: columns12-16 are 1,1,1,1,1.\n\nRow1: columns12 and 16 are 1, others are 0.\n\nRow2: columns12 and 16 are 1, others are 0.\n\nRow3: columns12 and 16 are 1, others are 0.\n\nRow4: columns12-16 are 1,1,1,1,1.\n\nThis forms a rectangle. The inner cells (rows1-3, columns13-15) are 0s. Let's check if these 0s are enclosed.\n\nFor example, row2, column14:0. Up is row1, column14:0. Down is row3, column14:0. Left is row2, column13:0. Right is row2, column15:0. These cells are enclosed by 1s in the surrounding rows and columns. So up is row0, which is 1s. Down is row4, which is 1s. Left is column12:1 in rows1-3. Right is column16:1 in rows1-3.\n\nSo for the cell at row2, column14: up is row1, column14:0. But the surrounding rectangle is formed by rows0 and 4, and columns12 and 16. So the cell is inside this rectangle but not enclosed by immediate neighbors. So according to the initial rule, since the cell's immediate up, down, left, right are 0s (row1, column14 is 0), it's not enclosed. So it's adjacent to 1s in the surrounding rectangle, but not directly adjacent. So according to the initial rule, these 0s are not adjacent to any 1s and remain 0. But according to the examples, they should become 2s if adjacent to any 1s.\n\nWait, wait. The cell at row1, column13:0. Let's check its adjacent cells.\n\nUp: row0, column13:1.\n\nDown: row2, column13:0.\n\nLeft: row1, column12:1.\n\nRight: row1, column14:0.\n\nSo adjacent to up and left 1s. So according to the rule, this 0 becomes 2. Similarly, other cells in this inner rectangle would be adjacent to 1s (from the rectangle's borders) and become 2s. But according to the initial rule, the 0s inside this rectangle are adjacent to 1s in the surrounding rectangle. \n\nSo for example, row2, column13:0. Up is row1, column13:0. Down is row3, column13:0. Left is row2, column12:1. Right is row2, column14:0. So adjacent to left 1. Becomes 2.\n\nRow2, column14:0. Up is row1, column14:0. Down is row3, column14:0. Left is row2, column13:0. Right is row2, column15:0. So not adjacent to any 1s. So remains 0.\n\nBut this is inside the rectangle formed by 1s. So according to the initial rule, these cells are not adjacent to 1s, so they remain 0. But according to the examples, the inner 0s of a rectangle are replaced with 7s. But this is not the case here. \n\nThis suggests that the initial rule is not correct. Therefore, the correct pattern must involve more than just immediate adjacency. It must involve enclosed regions, which requires a different approach.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think the best approach is to assume that the 7s are for 0s enclosed by 1s in all four directions, and 2s for 0s adjacent to 1s. Applying this to the test input, the only cells that would become 7s are those inside the rectangle formed by rows0-4, columns12-16. \n\nFor example, row1, column13:0. Up is row0, column13:1. Down is row2, column13:0. Left is row1, column12:1. Right is row1, column14:0. So adjacent to up and left 1s. Becomes 2.\n\nRow2, column14:0. Not adjacent to any 1s. So remains 0.\n\nThus, no 7s in this area.\n\nTherefore, the test output would have only 2s and original 1s and 0s.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, each output has at least one 7. So perhaps the test input has a 7 somewhere. \n\nAfter rechecking, I realize that in row4, column14: cell is 1. Not relevant.\n\nPerhaps in the lower part, the cells in row8, columns11-18 are 0s but are surrounded by 1s on three sides. But since down is 0, they are not enclosed.\n\nGiven this, I think the test input's output will replace all 0s adjacent to 1s with 2s and leave others as 0. But according to the training examples, the 7s are present when a 0 is fully surrounded by 1s. So if there are no such cells in the test input, there will be no 7s.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I think the test input has no 7s. So the answer will have 2s where 0s are adjacent to 1s and 0s elsewhere. \n\nBut let's proceed to generate the output based on the initial rule.",
