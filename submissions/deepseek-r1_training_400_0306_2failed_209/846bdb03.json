        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to transform the given input grids into the output grids based on some pattern observed in the training examples. Let's look at the examples one by one to understand what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0: The input has several rows with zeros and some numbers like 2, 1, 4. The output is a shorter grid. The output starts with [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4], which seems like it's taking the 4 from the 7th row (index 7 maybe) of the input's last element. Then the next line in the output is [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1]. Looking at the input rows, maybe the non-zero elements are being collected from specific rows? For instance, the fourth row in the input is [0,0,2,2,0,1,0,...], and the fifth row has 2, 1s. The output rows might be combining these elements. Also, the output has 6 rows compared to the input's 13. Maybe it's taking certain rows and condensing them.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 3s and 8s. The output starts and ends with 4s, which are present in the input's first and last rows. The middle rows of the output have 8s and 3s arranged in a pattern. For example, the second output row is [8,8,0,8,0,3,0,3]. Looking at the input rows, the second row has 3 and 8, and the third row has 3s and 8s. Maybe the output is taking non-zero elements from certain columns in the input rows and stacking them.\n\nAnother observation: The outputs are shorter in height than the inputs. The input has 13 rows, but the outputs have 6, 7, 4, 5 rows respectively. So perhaps the pattern involves selecting specific rows from the input and transforming their non-zero elements into the output rows.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has 4s, 2s, 1s. The output starts with [4,0,0,0,0,4], which corresponds to the 4s in row 1 and 4 of the input. Then the next rows are [2,0,2,1,1,1], which might be combining the 2s and 1s from rows 2,3, etc. So maybe each output row is formed by taking non-zero elements from certain input rows and concatenating them, or maybe combining adjacent non-zero elements.\n\nWait, another approach: The output rows might be formed by taking the non-zero elements from specific columns of the input rows. For example, in Example 0's input, the first output row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4], which could correspond to the 4s in the 7th and 13th positions of the 7th and 12th input rows. But how are the positions chosen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from each row of the input and then concatenating them, but only for certain rows. But looking at Example 0's input, the first three rows are all zeros, so they don't contribute to the output. The fourth row has 2,2,1, which might form part of the output's second row. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from each row, left to right, and combining them in some way. Let's check Example 0:\n\nInput rows (indices 0 to 12):\n\nRow 3: [0,0,2,2,0,1,0,...] \u2192 non-zeros: 2,2,1 \u2192 possible part of output row.\n\nOutput rows:\n\nFirst output row: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4] \u2192 perhaps from input rows 7 and 12 (which have 4s at the end). But how?\n\nAnother thought: The output might be formed by taking the borders of the input. For example, the first and last elements of certain rows. But Example 0's output first row has 4 and 4, which might correspond to the 4s in the input rows 7 and 12. Then the second output row has 2s and 1s, maybe from rows 3,4,5, which have 2s and 1s.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the non-zero elements from each column of the input, but only certain columns. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, looking at column 5 (index 5) in the input:\n\nRow 3: 1\n\nRow 4:1,1,1\n\nRow 5:1\n\nRow 7:4\n\nRow 12:4\n\nBut the output's first row is 4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4. Maybe columns that have non-zero elements in the first and last positions? Or perhaps it's grouping the non-zero elements from the input into vertical slices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a condensed version where each row in the output corresponds to a group of adjacent non-zero rows in the input. For example, in Example 0, input rows 3-5 have non-zeros, rows 7-12 have non-zeros. The output has 6 rows, maybe each output row is combining non-zero elements from those input rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input grid and arranging them in a certain way, like stacking them vertically but trimming zeros. But how does the order work?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output:\n\nInput has rows with 7s and 3s. The output rows are [7,7,7,0,3,3], [7,7,7,3,3,3], etc. These could be the non-zero elements from the corresponding input rows. For example, the input row 9 has 7,7,3. Output rows 1 and 2 have 7s and 3s arranged. So maybe the output rows are the non-zero elements of certain input rows, but how are they ordered?\n\nWait, perhaps each output row is a combination of non-zero elements from two adjacent input rows. For example, in Example 1, the second output row is [8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3]. The input rows 2 and 3 have 3,3,3 and 8,8,8. So combining them gives 8,8,8,8 (from row 2's 3,3,3 and row 3's 8,8,8? Wait, that doesn't match. Maybe each output row is taking non-zero elements from a vertical slice of the input. For example, looking at columns where there are non-zero elements in multiple rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is built by taking the non-zero elements from each column in the input, but only the columns that have non-zero elements. Then, for each such column, collect the non-zero values and arrange them in rows, possibly merging consecutive columns if they form a block.\n\nFor example, in Example 0, the input has non-zero elements in columns 2,3,5, etc. The output rows might be combining adjacent columns. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the columns with non-zero elements are:\n\nColumn 2: 2 (row3), 2 (row4?), etc. Maybe the output rows are formed by the columns that have non-zero elements, and each output row corresponds to a horizontal slice of those columns.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first and last non-zero elements from each row. For example, in row 3 of Example 0's input, the non-zero elements are at positions 2,3,5. The output row for that might take those values, but in the output, the second row is [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output structure in the examples, the first and last rows of the output often have 4s at the ends, which might correspond to the 4s in the input's first and last rows. So maybe the output is formed by taking the borders and then the inner non-zero elements.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern might be that the output is the \"compression\" of the input's non-zero elements. For each row in the input, if there are non-zero elements, they are added to the output, but merged in some way. For example, in Example 0, the input rows 3-5 and 7-12 have non-zero elements. The output has 6 rows: the first and last are the 4s from rows 7 and 12, and the middle rows are from rows 3-5 and 8-11 (which have 2s and 1s). So maybe the output is combining the non-zero elements from consecutive non-zero rows, merging them into a single row by taking the maximum value, or concatenating non-zeros.\n\nBut how to determine the order? For example, in Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4] \u2192 possibly from rows 7 and 12 of the input, which have 4s in the 5th and 12th positions.\n\nRow 1: [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1] \u2192 rows 3,4,5. The input row 3 has 2,2,1. Row4 has 2,1,1,1. Row5 has 2,2,1. So combining these, perhaps taking the non-zero elements from these rows in sequence. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by taking the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements in each row, then stacking them. For example, in Example 3's input, row 9 has 7,7,0,3. The output's first row after the 4s is [7,7,7,0,3,3]. Maybe combining the 7s from the left and 3s from the right.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the test input. Let's see:\n\nTest Input rows:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: 4 at position 1 and 8.\n\nRow 2: 2 at 1 and 8 at position 8.\n\nRows 2-5 have 2s and 8s.\n\nRow 6: 4s at positions 1 and 8.\n\nThen rows 9-12 have 8s and 2s.\n\nThe desired output should follow the pattern. Let's think about how the examples were transformed.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 3s and 8s arranged in a pattern, and the output seems to capture the outer 4s and then the inner 8s and 3s.\n\nLooking at the test input's structure:\n\nThe first part (rows 1-6) have 4, 2s, and 8s. Then rows 9-12 have 8s and 2s. So perhaps the output starts with the 4s from rows 1 and 6, then takes the 2s and 8s from rows 2-5 and 9-12.\n\nLooking at the test input rows 2-5 (indices 2 to 5):\n\nRow 2: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,...]\n\nRow 3: same as row 2.\n\nRow 4: same.\n\nRow 5: same.\n\nSo these rows have 2 at position 1 and 8 at position 8. So perhaps each of these rows contributes 2 and 8, but how?\n\nIn Example 0, the rows with 2s and 1s are combined into output rows with multiple 2s and 1s. So maybe the output rows are formed by taking the non-zero elements from each column across multiple rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from each column of the input and stacking them horizontally, but only for the columns that have non-zero values. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, column 5 has 1,1,1,1,4, etc. But in the output, there are 1s in some rows. But this is not matching directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a mirror image or rotated version. For example, in Example 0's output, the first row is [4,0,...4], which could correspond to the 4s in the input's rows 7 and 12. Then the next rows correspond to the 2s and 1s in the input's middle rows.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as a 13x13 grid, and the output is a smaller grid that captures certain features. For example, the borders (first and last non-zero elements) and internal structures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the result of collapsing each row's non-zero elements into a compressed form, then stacking those. For example, each input row's non-zero elements are written left to right, but in the output, rows with all zeros are skipped. But in Example 0, the output has more rows than the non-zero input rows. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input and output. The input has two vertical lines of 4s and 2s. The output starts with 4s, then 2s and 1s, then 4s again. The output rows are shorter, possibly capturing the vertical segments. So maybe the output is formed by taking the vertical sequences of non-zero numbers and transposing them into horizontal rows.\n\nFor example, in Example 2's input, column 2 has 4,2,2,4. The output's second and third rows have 2s and 1s, which might be from columns 3 and 5. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, each output row corresponds to a horizontal slice of the input's vertical non-zero sequences.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking each vertical \"strip\" of non-zero elements in the input and making them into rows. For example, if there's a vertical line of 2s in the input's column 2, that becomes a row of 2s in the output. But in Example 2's output, there are rows like [2,0,2,1,1,1]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are created by taking the non-zero elements from each \"block\" in the input. For example, if there's a cluster of non-zero numbers in the input, they form a row in the output. For Example 0, the output rows could be the clusters of 4s, 2s, 1s, etc.\n\nAnother observation: The output's rows often start and end with the same number, like 4s or 8s, which might correspond to the borders of the input's structures.\n\nLet me try to approach this differently. Let's look at the test input and try to see what the output should be, then see if that helps.\n\nTest Input:\n\nThe input has rows:\n\nRow 1: 4 at position 1 and 8 (position 8).\n\nRows 2-5: 2 at position 1 and 8 at position 8.\n\nRow 6: 4 at position 1 and 8.\n\nRows 9-12: 8s and 2s. For example, row 9 has 8 at 1 and 8 at 3, then 2 at 4. Row10 has 8,8,8 at positions 1-3, 2s at 4-6. Row11 has 8 at 1 and 2 at 5. Row12 has 8 at 1 and 2s at 5 and 6.\n\nSo the non-zero elements are in columns 1,3,4,5,6 (for rows 9-12) and columns 1 and 8 for rows 1-6.\n\nLooking at the training examples, particularly Example 1, where the output starts and ends with 4s and has 8s and 3s in the middle. The test input's rows 1 and 6 have 4s, so maybe the output's first and last rows are [4,0,...,4], but adjusted for length. Then the middle rows would be formed from the 2s and 8s in rows 2-5 and 8s/2s in rows 9-12.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the middle rows are combinations of 8s and 3s. For example, the output row [8,8,0,8,0,3,0,3] could be taking the 8s from certain columns and the 3s from others. Similarly, the test input's rows 2-5 have 2 and 8. Maybe the output's middle rows would combine these into rows with 2 and 8.\n\nLooking at the structure of Example 0 and Example 1's outputs, the first and last rows are the 4s, then the inner rows are combinations of other numbers. So for the test input, the first output row might be [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4], corresponding to the 4s in rows 1 and 6 (positions 1 and 8). Then, the next rows would process the 2s and 8s from rows 2-5. For example, rows 2-5 each have 2 at position 1 and 8 at position 8. If we take these, maybe each of these rows contributes a row in the output like [2,0,0,...,8]. But looking at Example 1's output, the rows with 8s and 3s are arranged in a way that combines multiple columns. So perhaps for the test input's rows 2-5, each contributes to an output row [2, 8], but padded with zeros. However, the output rows are longer. Wait, Example 1's output rows have more elements. Let's count: the outputs for Example 1 have 8 elements per row, while the input rows are 13 elements. So perhaps each output row is combining non-zero elements from multiple columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input's columns, left to right, and for each column, take the non-zero elements from top to bottom. So for example, column 1 in the test input has 4 (row1), 2 (rows2-5), 4 (row6), 8 (rows9-12). If we take these non-zero elements, they would form a column in the output, but transposed into a row. But how to handle multiple columns.\n\nWait, in Example 3's output, the second row is [7,7,7,0,3,3]. Looking at the input, column 5 has 7s in rows 2-4 and 9-11, and column 10 has 3s. So perhaps the output rows are formed by taking the non-zero elements from certain columns and merging them. For the test input, columns 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 have non-zero elements. So for each of these columns, collect the non-zero values and arrange them in rows. But how are they ordered? For example, column 1 has 4,2,2,2,2,4,8,8,8,8. The output rows might take these and stack them. But this would create a long column, but the outputs have rows. Maybe the output is a horizontal concatenation of these columns' non-zero elements. But then how are the rows formed.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the non-zero elements of the input columns, arranged vertically. For example, each output row corresponds to a column in the input, but only the non-zero elements. However, in Example 0's output, the first row has 4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4. That might correspond to two columns with a 4 each, separated by zeros.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the perimeter of non-zero regions. For example, the outer 4s in Example 0's input form the first and last output rows, and the inner 2s and 1s form the middle rows. For the test input, the perimeter would be the 4s and 8s, and the inner 2s.\n\nPutting this all together, perhaps the output is constructed by:\n\n1. Taking the outermost non-zero elements (like 4s in Example 0 and 1) as the first and last rows of the output.\n2. Then, for each horizontal section between these outer rows, taking the non-zero elements and arranging them into rows, possibly concatenating non-zero elements from adjacent columns.\n\nFor the test input:\n\n- The first and last rows of the output would be [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4] (from the 4s in rows 1 and 6, columns 1 and 8).\n- Rows 2-5 of the input have 2 and 8. These might form output rows like [2,8], but padded to match the length. But looking at Example 1's output, the rows are longer. Maybe each such row contributes to a part of the output rows, combined with others.\n- The rows 9-12 in the test input have 8s and 2s. For example, row 9 has 8,8,2. Row10 has 8,8,8,2,2,2. Row11 has 8 and 2. Row12 has 8 and two 2s. So these might form output rows combining these elements.\n\nPutting this together, the test output might look like:\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nThen rows for the 2s and 8s from rows 2-5. Maybe [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8] repeated four times, but in Example 0's output, the middle rows have varying patterns.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows for the middle sections are formed by combining the non-zero elements from each row in the input's middle section. For example, rows 2-5 of the input each contribute 2 and 8, so the output might have four rows like [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nThen, the rows from 9-12 would contribute their non-zero elements. For example, row9:8,8,2 \u2192 output row [8,8,0,2,0,...]. Row10:8,8,8,2,2,2 \u2192 [8,8,8,2,2,2]. Row11:8,2 \u2192 [8,0,0,2,0,...]. Row12:8,2,2 \u2192 [8,0,0,2,2].\n\nBut how does this fit into the output structure? The output might start with the 4 rows from the upper part (rows 2-5) and then the lower part (rows9-12). \n\nLooking at the training examples, Example 0's output has 6 rows: first and last are 4s, then four rows from the middle sections. The test input's output might have:\n\nRow 0: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRows 1-4: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8] (from input rows 2-5)\n\nRow5: [8,8,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [8,8,8,2,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow7: [8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [8,0,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nBut the training examples have varying output lengths. The challenge is to see how the examples compress these.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first and last non-zero elements of each row in the input, then creating a row in the output for each such pair. For example, in Example 0's input row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4], the first non-zero is 4 at position5 and last non-zero is 4 at position12. So the output row would be [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]. Then for row3: [0,0,2,2,0,1,0...], first non-zero is 2 at pos2, last non-zero is 1 at pos5. So the output row would be [2,0,0,1], but in the actual output, it's [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1]. So this approach might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from each row, starting from the first non-zero to the last non-zero, and then padding with zeros to a certain length. For Example 0's row3: 2,2,1 \u2192 [2,2,1], but padded to 8 elements. But the output row for this part is [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1], which doesn't match.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the output rows' lengths. Example 0's output rows have 8 elements. The input rows have 13 elements. 8 is roughly half of 13. Maybe the output is taking the middle part of the input. Or perhaps combining left and right parts.\n\nWait, 13 elements: the middle position is index6. If the output is taking elements from the left and right of the middle, but in a mirrored way. For example, the first element of the output row is the first non-zero on the left, and the last element is the first non-zero on the right. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by taking the non-zero elements from the left half and the right half of the input rows. For example, in Example 0's row7: left half has 4 at position5, right half has 4 at position12. So the output row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]. Then for row3, left half has 2,2 and right half has 1. So the output row would be [2,2,0,0,0,0,1,0], but the actual output row is [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. This is getting tricky. Let's try to look for another pattern. Let's compare the input and output of Example 0.\n\nInput rows (relevant ones):\n\nRow3: [0,0,2,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zeros: 2,2,1\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,2,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zeros:2,1,1,1\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zeros:2,2,1\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4] \u2192 non-zeros:4,4\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 non-zeros:2,1\n\nRows9-11: same as row8.\n\nRow12: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4] \u2192 non-zeros:4,4.\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow1: [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1]\n\nRow2: [2,0,2,0,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow3: [2,0,2,2,1,0,0,1]\n\nRow4: [2,0,0,2,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow5: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nLooking at the non-zero positions in the output rows:\n\nRow1: 2,2,2,1,1 \u2192 perhaps combining the 2s from rows3-5 and the 1s from row4.\n\nRow2: 2,2,1,1,1,1 \u2192 maybe from row4's 1s and row5's 2s.\n\nWait, maybe each output row is a combination of elements from different input rows. For example, row1 of the output combines the first three 2s from rows3-5 and the 1 from row3 and row5. But it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by taking each non-zero element from the input and placing them in the output in a way that resembles a vertical mirror. For example, the first 4 in row7 becomes the first element of the output row0, and the last 4 in row7 becomes the last element of output row0.\n\nThen, for rows3-5, the 2s and 1s are arranged in the output rows such that the leftmost 2s are on the left of the output row, and the rightmost 1s are on the right. So for row3, the left 2s are on the left, and the 1 is on the right. Similarly, row4's 2 is in the middle, and the 1s are on the right. This might create a pattern where each output row combines left and right elements from different input rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first non-zero element from the left and the first non-zero element from the right for each input row, then combining them into the output rows. For example, in row3, left non-zero is 2, right non-zero is 1. So the output row for this would be 2 and 1. But how this forms the output's row1 [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1] is unclear.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me think of another approach: perhaps the output is a compressed version of the input where each row in the output corresponds to a vertical slice of the input. For example, the input is divided into vertical sections, and each section's non-zero elements form a row in the output.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has vertical sections (columns) with non-zero elements. For instance, columns 2-4 have 2s, column5 has 1s and 4s, columns 12 has 4s. So the output rows could be these columns stacked. For example:\n\nColumn5 has elements: 1 (row3),1 (row4),1 (row5),4 (row7),2 (row8),2 (row9),2 (row10),2 (row11),4 (row12). This would form a column of [1,1,1,4,2,2,2,2,4], but how does this become part of the output rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is a combination of certain columns. For example, columns 2-5 and 12. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output rows are constructed by taking the first and last non-zero elements of each input row and placing them at the start and end of the output row, with the middle elements being the non-zero elements in between. For example, in row3 of Example0's input, first non-zero is 2 at position2, last is 1 at position5. So the output row would start with 2, then include the elements between 2 and 1 (which are 2,0,1), then end with 1. So [2,2,0,1,1]. But the actual output row1 is [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1], which has more elements.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the output is formed by taking all non-zero elements from the input, left to right, top to bottom, and arranging them into rows of length 8, padding with zeros if necessary. For Example0, the non-zero elements would be:\n\nRow3: 2,2,1\n\nRow4:2,1,1,1\n\nRow5:2,2,1\n\nRow7:4,4\n\nRow8:2,1\n\nRow9:2,1\n\nRow10:2,1\n\nRow11:2,1\n\nRow12:4,4\n\nSo combining these gives:\n\n2,2,1,2,1,1,1,2 \u2192 first output row after the 4s. But the actual output rows have different structures.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a kind of run-length encoding or a shift of non-zero elements. For example, in Example0's row3: 2,2,1. The output row1 starts with 2,2,2, which might be a shift or expansion of these elements.\n\nAnother possible pattern is that the output rows are formed by taking the sum of the non-zero elements in each column. For example, column5 in Example0's input has 1+1+1+4+2+2+2+2+4 = sum of 17, but the output rows don't reflect sums. So that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by taking the maximum value in each column. For Example0's column5: max is4. But the output row0 has 4, which is the max of column5, but not sure.\n\nLet me try to think of the test input again. The 4s are in rows1 and 6, which would form the first and last output rows. The rows2-5 have 2 and 8, which might be combined into output rows. Then rows9-12 have 8s and 2s.\n\nLooking at Example1's output, the middle rows combine 8s and 3s. Similarly, the test input's middle rows have 2s and 8s. So perhaps the output for the test input's middle rows would be something like:\n\n[2,8], [2,8], [2,8], [2,8] (from rows2-5)\n\nThen, for rows9-12:\n\nRow9: 8,8,2 \u2192 [8,8,2]\n\nRow10:8,8,8,2,2,2 \u2192 [8,8,8,2,2,2]\n\nRow11:8,2 \u2192 [8,2]\n\nRow12:8,2,2 \u2192 [8,2,2]\n\nBut how to format these into the output. The training examples have varying row lengths, but each example's output has uniform row lengths. For example, Example0's output has 8 elements per row. So maybe the test output's rows should all have the same length. Looking at the test input's possible non-zero elements:\n\nFrom rows1 and 6: 4 at positions1 and8 \u2192 output row0 and row5: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRows2-5: 2 at position1 and8 at position8 \u2192 each contributes to a row in the output. So perhaps [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8] for each of these rows, leading to four such rows.\n\nRows9-12:\n\nRow9: 8 at positions1,3,4 \u2192 output row: [8,8,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow10: 8 at 1-3, 2 at4-6 \u2192 [8,8,8,2,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow11:8 at1, 2 at5 \u2192 [8,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow12:8 at1, 2 at5-6 \u2192 [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,0]\n\nSo combining these, the output would have:\n\nRow0: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow1: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow2: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow3: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow4: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow5: [8,8,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [8,8,8,2,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow7: [8,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow9: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nBut this would make the output have 10 rows, but the training examples have fewer. Also, looking at Example1, the output has 7 rows. So maybe there's a compression step. Perhaps consecutive rows with the same pattern are merged. For example, rows1-4 of the test input's output would be merged into a single row if they are the same. But in this case, they are all [2,0,...,8], so maybe they are kept as four separate rows. However, Example0's output has four middle rows that are different. So perhaps each row is processed individually.\n\nBut how does the test input's rows9-12 fit into the output? The training examples don't have such a case, but Example1 has lower sections combined with the upper ones.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by first taking the upper part (rows1-6), then the lower part (rows9-12). So for the test input:\n\nUpper part output rows:\n\nRow0: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRows1-4: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow5: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nLower part (rows9-12) output rows:\n\nRow6: [8,8,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [8,8,8,2,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow8: [8,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,0]\n\nBut Example1's output has the upper part and lower part merged. For example, in Example1, the output starts and ends with 4s, and the middle rows are a mix of 8s and 3s from different parts of the input.\n\nSo perhaps for the test input, the output would be:\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[8,8,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,8,8,2,2,2,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,0,2,2,0,0]\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nBut the training examples have outputs with fewer rows. Example0 has 6 rows, Example1 has7, Example2 has4, Example3 has5. The test input's output might need to be condensed. \n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by taking the first occurrence of a non-zero in each column and then the last occurrence, creating a compressed view. For example, columns that have non-zero elements at the top and bottom are included in the output.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's look for another pattern in the training examples. \n\nIn Example1's input, the output rows after the initial 4s have 8s and 3s. The first such row is [8,8,0,8,0,3,0,3]. Looking at the input's row2: [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,8,0,8,0,0,0]. The non-zeros are 3 at position5 and 8s at 7 and9. The output row is [8,8,0,8,0,3,0,3], which seems to include the 8s and 3s from this row. Then the next output row has [8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3], which might be from input row3: [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,8,8,8,0,0,0]. Here, non-zeros are 3s at positions4-6 and 8s at 7-9. The output row combines all these into 8s and 3s, perhaps taking the left 8s and right 3s.\n\nWait, maybe the output rows are created by taking the non-zero elements from the left side and the right side of each input row, and combining them. For example, in Example1's input row2: left non-zero is 3 at position5, right non-zeros are 8s at positions7 and9. The output row combines the 8s from the right and the 3s from the left. So the output row becomes [8,8,0,8,0,3,0,3]. This could mean that for each input row, the leftmost non-zero elements are placed on the right side of the output row, and the rightmost non-zero elements on the left side. Or perhaps the output row is a mirror of the input's non-zero elements.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by reversing the order of the non-zero elements in each input row. For example, input row2 in Example1 has 3,8,8. Reversed, it would be 8,8,3. But the output row has 8,8,0,8,0,3,0,3. Not sure.\n\nAnother possibility: The output rows are built by taking the non-zero elements from the input's rows, splitting them into left and right parts, and arranging them in the output row. For example, in Example0's row3: non-zeros are 2,2,1. Left part is 2,2 and right part is 1. The output row is [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1]. The left part is extended (maybe adding another 2) and the right part is extended (adding 1 at the end). How?\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero element in the input row is duplicated or expanded into multiple elements in the output row. For example, a 2 in the input could become 2,0,2 in the output. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, I'll make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nFor the test input, the output should start and end with [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4], capturing the 4s in rows1 and 6. Then, the middle rows would capture the 2s and 8s from rows2-5 and the 8s and 2s from rows9-12. \n\nThe middle rows might be:\n\nFor rows2-5 (each has 2 and 8):\n\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRepeated four times.\n\nThen, rows9-12:\n\nRow9:8,8,2 \u2192 [8,8,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow10:8,8,8,2,2,2 \u2192 [8,8,8,2,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow11:8,2 \u2192 [8,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow12:8,2,2 \u2192 [8,0,0,0,2,2,0,0]\n\nThen the output would have:\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[8,8,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,8,8,2,2,2,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,0,0,2,2,0,0]\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nBut this has 10 rows, which is longer than any of the training examples. However, looking at Example1's output, which has 7 rows, perhaps the test output is condensed. Maybe the rows from the lower part (rows9-12) are merged into fewer rows. For example, row10's [8,8,8,2,2,2] becomes part of the output, and the other rows are merged.\n\nAlternatively, the output includes only the first and last rows of the upper and lower sections, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed to the final answer based on the training examples' pattern, especially Example1 and Example0. The output likely starts and ends with 4s, and the middle rows combine the 2s and 8s from the upper part and the 8s and 2s from the lower part, formatted similarly to the training examples.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids. Let's look at the training examples first.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 13x13 grid, and the output is a smaller grid. Let me see the dimensions. The output for Example 0 has 6 rows, each with 8 elements. Wait, the input has 13 rows and 13 columns. How are they transformed?\n\nLooking at the output rows in Example 0, the first row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]. Hmm. Let me check where the 4s are in the input. In the input, the 4s are at the end of the 7th and 13th rows. Maybe the output is taking certain columns and rows from the input.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking non-zero elements from specific regions of the input. Let's check. In Example 0's input, the non-zero elements are in rows 3 to 7 and 8 to 12. For instance, row 7 has a 4 in column 5 and 13. The output's first row is [4,0,...4], maybe that's columns 5 and 13? But the output row has 8 elements, which is shorter than 13. Maybe they are combining certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the central parts or certain symmetries. Let me see another example.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 7 rows. The input has non-zero elements in various places. The output starts and ends with [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4], similar to Example 0. Wait, in Example 1's input, the first and last rows of the output correspond to the 7th and 13th rows of the input. For example, the 7th input row is [0,4,0,...4,0], and the output's first and last rows are [4,0...4], maybe taking the 4s from columns 1 and 9? Because in input row 7, columns 1 and 9 are 4, and in the output row, those positions are 4s. But the output rows are shorter, so perhaps it's a different arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to certain input rows. Let's check another example. Example 2's input has a 4,0,0,0,4 in the second row, and the output starts with [4,0,0,0,0,4]. So maybe the output is taking the non-zero elements from the input rows and arranging them in a specific way.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the non-zero elements from the input and arranging them in a diamond or symmetrical pattern. Let me look for a pattern.\n\nAnother approach: the outputs often start and end with a 4, maybe indicating the borders. Looking at the input's columns that have 4s. For Example 0, the 7th row has 4 in column 5 and 13. The output's first and last rows have 4s in the first and last positions, but how does that relate?\n\nWait, maybe each output row is a compressed version of certain rows in the input. For example, in Example 0, the output has 6 rows, which might correspond to rows 7 to 12 of the input. Let's check:\n\nInput row 7 (index 6, 0-based): [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]. The output's first row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]. So taking the 4s from columns 5 and 12 (0-based index 5 and 12?), maybe. But the output row is 8 elements. The input row has 13 elements, perhaps taking positions 5 and 12 as the first and last elements, and the middle elements are zeros. But that's just two 4s. Maybe other rows are processed similarly.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the second row is [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1]. Looking at the input rows that have 2s and 1s. For example, input row 3 (index 3) is [0,0,2,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But the output row has 2,2,2,0,1... Maybe combining elements from multiple rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the central columns of the input. The input is 13 columns, so the middle is column 6 (0-based index 6). Maybe taking columns 5 to 12? But that would be 8 columns, which matches the output rows in Example 0. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input row 3, columns 5 is 1. If the output is taking columns 5 to 12, then the first element would be 1. But the output's second row starts with 2,2,2. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the output is created by taking columns symmetrically around the center. For example, for each input row, take the center 8 columns. Let's see. 13 columns, center is column 6 (0-based). Taking columns 2 to 9 (since 8 columns: 6-3=3, 6+3=9, but that's 7 columns. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows might be formed by taking certain elements from the input's rows, possibly in a mirrored way. For example, Example 0's output row 2 is [2,0,2,0,1,1,1,1]. Let's look at input rows that have these elements. Input row 4 (index 4) is [0,0,0,2,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]. If we take elements 2 (which is 0), then 3 (2), then 4 (0), then 5 (1), etc. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs in Examples 0, 1, 2, 3 all have borders (first and last rows) with 4s or other numbers, perhaps indicating that those are from the top and bottom of the input. For instance, in Example 0, the output's first row is [4,0,...4], which might correspond to the input's row 7 (index 6) which has 4s in columns 5 and 12. The output's first row has 8 elements, maybe taking those two 4s and filling the rest with zeros. But how?\n\nWait, maybe each output row is a combination of two input rows. For example, in Example 0's output, the first row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4], which could be combining the two 4s from input row 7 (columns 5 and 12). Then the next output row is [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1], which might be combining elements from input rows 3, 4, 5. Let me check:\n\nInput row 3 (index 3): [0,0,2,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nInput row 4 (index4): [0,0,0,2,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\nInput row 5 (index5): [0,0,0,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nIf we look at columns 2,3,4,5,6, etc. from these rows, maybe the output rows are combining the non-zero elements. For example, row3 has 2,2 in columns2-3, row4 has 2 in column3, row5 has 2,2 in columns3-4. The output row is [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1]. Maybe combining these elements and others.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the non-zero elements from each input row, centered and padded with zeros. But that doesn't quite fit.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input. The output has rows like [4,0,0,0,0,4], which might correspond to input rows that start and end with 4. For example, input row1 (index1) is [0,0,4,0,...4,0], which in columns 2 and 9 (0-based) are 4s. The output's first row is [4,0,0,0,0,4], which is 6 elements. So maybe taking the 4s from those columns and putting them at the start and end, with zeros in between.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3's input, the output rows start and end with 4s. So the pattern seems to be that the output is capturing certain \"blocks\" or \"features\" from the input, possibly the non-zero elements arranged in a symmetrical way.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from each \"ring\" or \"layer\" of the input grid. For example, the outermost non-zero elements form the first and last rows of the output, and inner layers form the middle rows. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a compressed version where each row is a horizontal slice through the input's vertical non-zero regions. For example, taking the maximum value in each column for certain rows. But that doesn't fit Example 0's output.\n\nWait, looking at the output rows in Example 0:\n\nFirst row: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4] \u2192 perhaps from input row7 (index6) columns5 and12 (0-based 5 and 12) \u2192 positions 5 and 12 in a 13-column input. The output has 8 columns. So maybe positions 5-12? 5 to 12 is 8 columns. Let's check.\n\nIn input row7 (index6): columns5 is 4, column12 is4. The rest are 0. So columns5-12 would be [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4], which matches the first output row.\n\nThen the next output rows might be from other rows, taking columns5-12. Let's check row3 (index3): columns5 is1. Columns5-12 would be [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But the second output row is [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, maybe taking columns from a different range. Let's see: the output row has 8 elements. Maybe columns 3-10 (since 3 to 10 is 8 columns). Let's check.\n\nIn input row7, columns3-10: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]. But the output's first row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4], which would require 4s at the first and last positions. That doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAlternative approach: the output rows are formed by taking every other column from the input rows. For example, in Example 0's first output row, the 4s are at positions 0 and 7 (0-based). The input row7's 4s are at columns5 and12. If we map input column5 to output position0, and column12 to position7, then maybe the output is taking columns5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. So columns5-12. But that's 8 columns. Let's check:\n\nIn input row7 (columns5-12): [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]. Which matches the first output row.\n\nThen input row3 (columns5-12): columns5 is1, columns6-12 are0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So the row would be [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But the output's second row is [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Maybe this approach isn't right. Let's look at another example.\n\nIn Example1's input row1 (index1) is [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,8,0,8,0,0,0]. The output's first row after the borders is [8,8,0,8,0,3,0,3]. If columns5-12 are 3,0,8,0,8,0,0,0. But that would be [3,0,8,0,8,0,0,0], which doesn't match the output row [8,8,0,8,0,3,0,3]. So this approach is likely incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the output is created by mirroring parts of the input. For example, taking left and right parts and combining them. Let's see Example0's input row3: [0,0,2,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The middle is at column6 (0-based). Left part from column0-6, right part from column6-12. If mirrored, maybe combining them.\n\nAlternatively, for each input row, take the left half and reverse it and append to the right half. But that may not fit.\n\nAnother observation: the number of output rows is less than the input. For example, Example0's input has 13 rows, output 6 rows. So maybe selecting certain rows. Looking at Example0's input:\n\nThe non-zero rows start from row3 (index3) to row12 (index12). The output has 6 rows, which could be every other row or specific ones.\n\nWait, Example0's output rows:\n\nRow0: 4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4 \u2192 from input row6 (index6) columns5 and12.\n\nRow1: 2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1 \u2192 perhaps from input rows3,4,5 and others.\n\nRow2: 2,0,2,0,1,1,1,1 \u2192 maybe input row4.\n\nRow3: 2,0,2,2,1,0,0,1 \u2192 input row5.\n\nRow4: 2,0,0,2,0,0,0,1 \u2192 input row6 (but row6 in input is [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which has a 2 in column4. So maybe this isn't matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are formed by combining vertical slices from the input. For example, taking columns from the input where non-zero elements are present and stacking them.\n\nLooking at Example0's input, the non-zero columns are around columns2-5 and 5-12. Let's see:\n\nIn row3 (index3), columns2-4 are 2,2,0,1. Row4 columns3-5: 2,0,1. Row5 columns3-5: 2,2,1. Row6 column4: 2. Row7 column5:4,12:4. Rows8-11 column5:2, and column12:1. Row12 column5:4,12:4.\n\nBut how this translates to the output rows isn't clear.\n\nAnother angle: the output seems to have a kind of symmetry. For instance, in Example0's output, the first and last rows are [4...4], and the middle rows have 2s and 1s. Maybe the output is a diamond shape formed by the non-zero elements. Let's check the positions.\n\nIn Example0's input, the non-zero elements form a sort of diamond. For example, row3 has 2,2,1. Row4 has 2,1,1,1. Row5 has 2,2,1. Row6 has a single 2. Then rows7 has 4s. Rows8-11 have 2s and 1s. Row12 has 4s. Maybe the output is capturing these elements in a diamond pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the result of rotating or transposing parts of the input. For example, the input's vertical structures become horizontal in the output.\n\nAnother idea: the output is created by taking the maximum value from each quadrant or section of the input. For example, splitting the input into regions and taking the max. But this is vague.\n\nLooking at Example3's input and output. The output starts with [4,0,0,0,0,4], which might correspond to input rows1 and5 (indexes0-based 1 and5). Input row1: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]. Columns5 and10 have 4s. Output row0 is [4,0,0,0,0,4]. So maybe taking columns5 and10. But how does that become 6 elements?\n\nWait, the output row has 6 elements. If columns5 and10 are 4s, then the output could be [4,0,0,0,0,4], which is 6 elements. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the first, middle, and last elements, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be taking every other column. For example, in Example3's input row1, columns5 is4, column10 is4. If we take columns5 and10, but the output row is longer. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input, arranged in a certain way. For example, in Example0's output, the second row is [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1]. The input rows3,4,5 have 2s and 1s. Let's see:\n\nRow3 (columns2,3,5) \u2192 2,2,1.\n\nRow4 (columns3,5,6,7,8) \u2192 2,1,1,1.\n\nRow5 (columns3,4,5) \u21922,2,1.\n\nMaybe combining these into a single row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the result of concatenating the non-zero elements from each horizontal slice. For instance, in row3 of the input, the non-zeros are 2,2,1. In row4, 2,1,1,1. But the output rows have multiple elements, so maybe it's combining these with padding.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to find another pattern. The outputs for the training examples have varying numbers of rows. For example, Example0's output has 6 rows, Example1 has 7, Example2 has 4, Example3 has 5. The number of output rows seems to correspond to the number of non-zero rows in the input. For Example0, input has non-zero rows from row3 to row12 (10 rows?), but output has 6. So perhaps not directly.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0's output, the first and last rows have 4s at the ends. The corresponding input rows (7 and 12) also have 4s. The middle rows of the output have 2s and 1s, which correspond to earlier input rows. So maybe the output is a vertical slice of the input, taking certain columns and arranging them in rows. For instance, taking column5 from rows7,3,4,5,6, etc., and forming a new row.\n\nWait, let's look at column5 in the input for Example0. Row3:1, row4:1, row5:1, row6:0, row7:4, rows8-12:2,2,2,2,4. If column5 is [1,1,1,0,4,2,2,2,2,4]. But the output rows don't directly correspond to this. However, the output has rows with 1s and 4s and 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by rotating the input 90 degrees and then taking a certain section. Rotating the input matrix clockwise would transpose rows and columns. For example, in Example0's input, the non-zero elements form a sort of vertical structure. Rotating it might make them horizontal. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the test input and see if applying a possible pattern would generate the expected output. The test input is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 0, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe output should follow the pattern from the training examples. Let's imagine what the output would look like.\n\nIf the pattern is to take columns5-12 (or some other columns) from certain rows:\n\nLooking at rows 1 and 6 (indexes1 and6) which have 4s in columns1 and8. So maybe the output's first and last rows are [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4] (assuming columns1 and8 are mapped to the ends). Wait, in Example0, the output's first row was [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4], which came from columns5 and12. But in the test input's row1 and6, the 4s are in columns1 and8 (0-based). So if the output's first row is formed by taking these 4s, then it might be [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4], but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are constructed by taking the non-zero elements from the input rows and arranging them in a way that mirrors the structure. For example, the test input has 4s in rows1 and6, columns1 and8. Then, in the rows below (rows9-12), there are 8s and 2s. So perhaps the output will have rows like [4,0,...4], then rows with 8s and 2s arranged in a pattern.\n\nAnother idea: the output is constructed by taking the non-zero elements from each column of the input, arranged in a row-wise manner. For example, columns with non-zero values are stacked horizontally in the output. But how?\n\nLooking at Example0's output, the second row is [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1]. The input columns that have 2s and 1s in certain rows. For example, column2 has 2 in rows3-5, column3 has 2 in rows3-5, etc. But I'm not sure how this becomes the output row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking each non-zero \"block\" in the input and representing it in the output. For example, a vertical line of 2s in the input becomes a horizontal line in the output.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows9-12:\n\nRow9: [0,8,0,8,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow10: [0,8,8,8,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow11: [0,8,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow12: [0,8,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThese rows have 8s in column1, and 8s in columns2-4 in row10. The 2s start in column4 (row9), column4-6 (row10), column5 (row11), column5-6 (row12). So perhaps in the output, these would form rows like [8,8,8,8,2,2,2, ...], but how?\n\nLooking at Example1's output, which has rows with 8s and 3s arranged in a pattern. For instance, the second row is [8,8,0,8,0,3,0,3]. So maybe the output is capturing the non-zero elements from different sections of the input and arranging them in a particular order.\n\nAnother pattern: in the training examples, the output rows often start and end with the same number (like 4, 8, etc.), which may correspond to the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements in the input rows. For example, in Example0's output, the second row starts with 2s and ends with 1. The input's row3 has 2s on the left and 1 on the right.\n\nSo maybe the output is constructed by taking, for each relevant input row, the leftmost non-zero element and the rightmost non-zero element, and filling the middle with the other non-zero elements in between, ordered from left to right, padded with zeros to make the output row length.\n\nLet's test this with Example0's input row3: [0,0,2,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Leftmost non-zero is 2 (column2), rightmost is 1 (column5). The non-zero elements between them are 2 (column3) and 1. So the output row would be [2,2,0,1], but that's shorter than the output row [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1]. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output row for each input row is formed by taking all the non-zero elements from the input row, ordered from left to right, and then mirrored. For example, row3 has 2,2,1 \u2192 mirrored as 2,2,1,1,2,2. But that's 6 elements, not 8.\n\nAlternatively, the output row for each input row is the non-zero elements plus their mirror image. So for row3: [2,2,1,0,0,0,1,2,2]. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the non-zero elements from the input rows, centered in the output row. For example, input row3's non-zero elements are 2,2,1. The output row for this is [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1]. Hmm, not sure how this would center.\n\nAnother thought: the output rows are created by taking the input rows and collapsing multiple adjacent non-zero elements into a single value, possibly their sum or maximum. For instance, row3's 2,2,0,1 becomes 2,2,1 (max) or sum 2+2+1=5. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the non-zero elements from the input row, but arranged in a way that reflects their position. For example, the first non-zero element is placed at the start, the last at the end, and others in between, with zeros elsewhere.\n\nIn Example0's input row3: non-zero elements are at positions2,3,5 (values2,2,1). So output row would be [2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0], but the actual output is [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1]. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output row is combining elements from multiple input rows. For example, the second output row in Example0 combines elements from rows3,4,5. For instance, the 2s from row3's columns2-3, row4's column3, row5's columns3-4. So maybe taking the maximum from each column across those rows.\n\nRow3: columns2-5: 2,2,0,1.\n\nRow4: columns3-6:2,0,1,1.\n\nRow5: columns3-5:2,2,1.\n\nIf taking the max for each column:\n\nColumns2: max(2 from row3, 0 from row4, 0 from row5) \u21922.\n\nColumns3: max(2,2,2) \u21922.\n\nColumns4: max(0,0,2) \u21922.\n\nColumns5: max(1,1,1) \u21921.\n\nThen the output row would be [2,2,2,1], but the output is [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1]. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting quite complicated. Let's try to look for a different approach.\n\nLooking at Example2's input and output. The output is:\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,4]\n[2,0,2,1,1,1]\n[2,2,2,1,0,1]\n[4,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nThe input has 4s in rows1 and4 (indexes1 and4), columns2 and8. The output's first and last rows are [4,0,0,0,0,4], which could be columns2 and8, padded with zeros in between. The middle rows have 2s and1s from other parts.\n\nIn Example2's input, row9 has [0,0,0,1,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Columns3-5:1,1,2. The output's second row is [2,0,2,1,1,1]. Maybe combining elements from different parts.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the input's non-zero elements, and for each row, the output is the non-zero elements arranged in a specific way, possibly reversed or mirrored, and padded with zeros to a certain length.\n\nFor example, in Example0's input row3: non-zero elements are 2,2,1. Output row1 is [2,2,2,0,1,0,0,1]. Maybe this is combining row3's elements with others. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the result of scanning the input matrix in a certain order (like spiral) and capturing the non-zero values. But that's probably too complex.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0's output, the first and last rows are [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]. The middle rows have sequences of 2s and 1s. The input has 4s in the middle rows (row7 and 12), and 2s and1s in rows3-5 and8-11. So perhaps the output is constructed by taking:\n\n- The top and bottom 4s as the first and last rows.\n- The middle rows are the non-zero elements from the other rows, arranged in a certain pattern.\n\nFor the middle rows, perhaps each row is constructed by taking the non-zero elements from the input row, left-aligned and right-aligned, then merged. For example, input row3: 2,2,1. Left-aligned would be [2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0], right-aligned would be [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,1]. Merging by taking max or sum? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the non-zero elements from the input row, followed by the non-zero elements from the mirrored row (mirror around the center column). For example, input row3: 2,2,1. Mirrored row3 would have elements reversed, so 1,2,2. Combining gives [2,2,1,1,2,2]. But output row has 8 elements.\n\nThis is taking too long. Let's think of the test case. The test input has:\n\n- Rows1 and6: 4s at columns1 and8.\n- Rows2-5: 2s at column1, and 8s at column8.\n- Rows9-12: 8s in column1 and varying columns (3,4 for 2s).\n\nThe output might start and end with rows [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4], then have rows combining the 2s and8s. For example, rows2-5 of the test input have 2s and8s. So the output's middle rows might be [2,2,2,0,8,0,0,8] or something similar. But looking at Example1's output, which also has 8s and3s, the rows are structured with 8s and3s mirrored. So perhaps the test output's middle rows are [2,2,2,0,8,0,0,8], but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows for the test input would be:\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4] (from rows1 and6)\n[2,2,2,0,8,0,0,8] (from rows2-5)\n[8,8,8,8,2,2,2,8] (from rows9-12)\n[8,8,0,8,2,0,0,8]\n[8,8,0,8,2,2,0,8]\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nBut this is just a guess based on similar patterns in the training examples. The exact arrangement is unclear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the pattern is that each output row corresponds to a vertical slice of the input, taking the non-zero elements from certain columns and arranging them in the output rows. For example, columns that have non-zero values in the input are extracted and stacked as rows in the output.\n\nLooking at Example0's input:\n\n- Columns2,3,4,5 have non-zero values in rows3-6.\n- Columns5 and12 have 4s in rows7 and12.\n- Columns5 (rows8-11) have 2s and1s.\n\nThe output rows might be columns2,3,4,5,5,5,5,12 (repeated columns?), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by rotating the input 90 degrees and then extracting certain rows. For example, rotating the input matrix clockwise would transpose the rows and columns. Then taking the central part where non-zero elements are present.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without a clear pattern, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the examples. The outputs seem to capture the non-zero elements in a way that forms a diamond or hourglass shape, with borders determined by the 4s in the input. The middle rows combine the non-zero elements from different parts of the input. For the test input, the output might start and end with rows [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4], then have rows with 2s and8s, followed by rows with8s and2s.\n\nBased on the training examples, the output rows are constructed by taking the non-zero elements from specific columns of the input rows, arranged in a certain order. For example, in Example0, the first output row corresponds to the input row with the 4s in columns5 and12. The subsequent rows take the 2s and1s from earlier rows. \n\nFor the test input, the 4s are in columns1 and8 of rows1 and6. So the first and last output rows would be [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]. The middle rows would take the 2s from rows2-5 (column1) and the8s from column8, possibly combining them with other elements from rows9-12 where there are8s and2s.\n\nPutting this together, the output for the test input might look like:\n\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n[2,2,2,0,8,0,0,8]\n[2,0,0,0,8,0,0,8]\n[2,0,0,0,8,0,0,8]\n[2,0,0,0,8,0,0,8]\n[8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2]\n[8,0,8,0,2,0,0,0]\n[8,0,0,0,2,2,0,0]\n[4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training example formats. Alternatively, considering the test input's rows9-12, which have 8s and 2s, the output might have rows like:\n\n[8,8,0,8,2,0,0,0]\n[8,8,8,8,2,2,2,0]\n[8,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n[8,0,0,0,2,2,0,0]\n\nCombining these, the final output would be:\n\n[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n[2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8]\n[8, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n[8, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n[8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n\nBut this is a guess. To align with the training examples' formats, the output rows likely start and end with 4s, then middle rows have 8s and2s arranged in a pattern similar to the input's non-zero elements.",
