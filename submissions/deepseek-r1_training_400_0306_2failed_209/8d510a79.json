        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is that we have these grids of numbers, and for each training example, the input grid is transformed into the output grid somehow. My job is to figure out what transformation is happening and apply it to the test input.\n\nLooking at the training examples. Let's start with Example 0. The input has several rows with 0s, some 1s, 2s, and a row of 5s. The output seems to have some changes. Let me compare the input and output rows.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput row 0: [0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. So a 1 was added at position 6.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] in input. Output row 1 is the same as input. So no change here.\n\nRow 2 in input has 0,2,0,... and output row 2 is same as input. Then rows 3 and 4 in input are all 0s. Output rows 3 and 4 become [0,2,0,...], same as row 2's values. So maybe copying the 2s from row 2 into rows below?\n\nWait, row 2 in input has two 2s at positions 1 and 9. In output, rows 3 and 4 now also have 2s in those positions. So perhaps, whenever there's a row with 2s, the rows below (until the row of 5s) get those 2s copied?\n\nBut the row of 5s is in row 5. So rows above the 5s? Let's check. The input's row 5 is all 5s, and in output, it's the same. Then rows below that: rows 6 and 7 in input are all 0s. In output, rows 6 and 7 have 2s in position 5. Looking at row 8 in input: [0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0]. The output row 8 is same as input. Then row 9 in input is all 0s, and output row 9 becomes [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0], which copies the 1s from row 8's positions 1 and 8 into row 9?\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that for each row with a number (like 1 or 2), the rows below it (up to the next non-zero row or the 5s) copy those numbers. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0 input, row 0 has a 1 at position 2. The output row 0 has a 1 at position 2 and 6. Hmm, where does the 6 come from? The input row 1 has a 1 at position 6. Wait, maybe there's a connection between rows above and below the 5s. Because in Example 0's input, the 5s are in row 5. So perhaps, the numbers from rows above the 5s are mirrored below?\n\nWait, row 0 in input has a 1 at position 2. Output row 0 adds a 1 at position 6. Position 6 is symmetric around the middle if the array length is 10. For example, index 2 and index 7 (since 10-2-1=7? Wait, 0-based index, so for a 10-element array, the mirror of position i would be 9 - i. Let's check. Position 2 mirrored is 9-2=7. But in Example 0's output row 0, the added 1 is at position 6. That doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe not mirroring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers from the rows above the 5s are copied to the corresponding rows below the 5s, but shifted in some way. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0 (above 5s) has 1 at position 2. Output row 0 adds a 1 at position 6, which is in the same row. But in the output rows below the 5s (rows 6 and 7), there are 2s at position 5. Wait, maybe the 5s act as a mirror line. So rows above the 5s are mirrored down below, but with some adjustment.\n\nLooking at the 5s in row 5. So rows 0-4 are above, rows 6-9 are below. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 8 (below the 5s) has 1s and a 2. The output row 9 copies some of those. Maybe the numbers from the rows above the 5s are being projected down below, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row above the 5s is combined with the corresponding row below. For instance, row 0 (above) and row 9 (below), row 1 and row 8, etc. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's output row 0 has a 1 in position 2 (from input row 0) and a 1 in position 6. Input row 1 (original) has a 1 in position 6. So maybe when combining row 0 and row 1 (since they are adjacent), some elements are merged.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the 2s. In input row 2 of Example 0, there are 2s at positions 1 and 9. In the output, rows 3 and 4 also have 2s in those positions. So maybe when a row has 2s, the next few rows until the 5s row get those 2s.\n\nBut how about the 1s? In row 8 of the input (which is below the 5s), there's a 2 at position 5. The output rows 6 and 7 have a 2 at position 5. So maybe the 2 from row 8 (below) is propagated upwards to the rows just below the 5s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any number (1 or 2) in a row above the 5s is copied downwards to all rows below it until the 5s, and similarly, any number in a row below the 5s is copied upwards to all rows above it until the 5s. Wait, let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0 input:\n\nRow 0 has a 1 at position 2. The rows below it (rows 1, 2,3,4) are between row 0 and the 5s. So copying the 1 down. But in output row 0, there's an additional 1 at position 6. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the 1s and 2s. 1s might represent some kind of vertical lines, and 2s horizontal? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, perhaps the numbers are being filled in such a way that they form continuous vertical lines where possible.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output row 0 has 1 at position 2 and 6. Then rows 1 and 2 have 1 at position 6. Wait, row 1's output has 1 at 6. Wait, but input row 1 in Example 0 had a 1 at position 6. So that's the same. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output.\n\nIn Example 1's input:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Output row 0: [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0]. So a 1 is added at position 7.\n\nInput row 1: [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0]. Output row 1: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0]. So a 2 is added at position 1.\n\nHmm. It's getting complicated. Maybe the pattern is that for each cell with a 1 or 2, we project that value downward (if above the 5s) or upward (if below the 5s) until the 5s row, but with some direction.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are being extended in all directions until they hit a 5 or another number. For example, in Example 0's input row 8 (below the 5s) has a 2 in position 5. The output has rows 6 and 7 (which are above the 5s) with 2 in position 5. So the 2 from below is moving upwards through the 5s? But how?\n\nWait, in the input of Example 0, the 5s are in row 5. The 2 in row 8 (position 5) is in a row below the 5s. In the output, rows 6 and 7 (which are below the 5s) have 2 in position 5. So perhaps the 2 in row 8 is being propagated upwards through the 5s, but how? Because the 5s are in between. Or maybe the 5s act as a mirror. So elements below the 5s are mirrored above, and vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers above the 5s are mirrored below, and the numbers below are mirrored above, but with the 5s acting as a central axis.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0 has a 1 at position 2. The output row 0 has a 1 at position 2 and 6. If the mirroring is around the 5s (row 5), then the index above row 5 would be mirrored to the row below. For example, row 0 (distance 5 from row 5) would correspond to row 10-1-0=9 (since 5 is the middle, but indexes are 0-9. Wait, the middle between 0-9 is 4.5, so rows 4 and 5. Hmm. Alternatively, the 5s split the grid into two halves. Rows 0-4 are above, 5 is the middle, 6-9 are below. So row 0's mirror would be row 9, row 1's mirror row 8, row 2's mirror row 7, row 3's mirror row 6, row 4's mirror row 5? Wait, row 5 is all 5s, so maybe not.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, row 0 has a 1 at position 2 and 6. The original input's row 0 has a 1 at position 2, and the output adds a 1 at position 6. Position 6 in row 0's output could be the mirror of position 2 in row 9. But row 9's input is all 0s. Alternatively, maybe the 1 from row 0's position 2 is mirrored in the same row's position 7 (since 9-2=7). But 0-based index 9-2=7. So for position 2 in row 0, mirrored would be position 7. But the output adds 1 at position 6. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a number is present in a cell, it's copied to the same column in the mirrored row. For example, row 0's cell 2 (value 1) is mirrored to row 9's cell 2. But in Example 0's output, row 9's cell 1 and 8 have 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, numbers above the 5s are copied to the rows below the 5s, but in a certain way. Let's look at Example 0's output. The row 0 (above 5s) has a 1 at position 2 and 6. Then, rows below the 5s (like row 8) have 1s. Wait, row 8 in input has 1s at positions 1 and 8. Output row 9 has 1s at positions 1 and 8 as well. So perhaps, the 1s from row 8 are copied to the row below (row 9). But in the input, row 9 is all 0s, so output row 9 is the same as row 8's 1s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could involve numbers \"falling\" down or up until they hit the 5s. Like, numbers above the 5s fall down to the first available row below the 5s, and vice versa. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for vertical columns. For example, in Example 0's output, column 2 has a 1 in row 0. Column 6 has 1s in rows 0 and 1. Column 1 has 2s in rows 2,3,4. Column 9 has 2s in rows 2,3,4. Column 5 in rows 6 and 7 has 2s. So maybe each number is creating vertical lines either upwards or downwards.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, row 2 has 2s at columns 1 and 9. In the output, these 2s are extended down to rows 3 and 4. So 2s are being propagated downward until the 5s. Then, the 5s are in row 5, which is all 5s, so the 2s stop there. Similarly, in the input's row 8 (below 5s), there's a 2 at column 5. In the output, this 2 is propagated upwards to rows 6 and 7. So 2s below the 5s are moving up until the 5s row. So the pattern seems to be:\n\n- For any cell with a 2, propagate that 2 in the same column upwards or downwards (depending on whether it's above or below the 5s row) until reaching the 5s row.\n\n- For 1s, maybe they propagate in some other direction. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 0 has a 1 at column 2. The output adds another 1 at column 6. Hmm, but how? Maybe the 1 is mirrored horizontally. Like, column 2 and column 7 (mirror across the middle of the row). For a 10-element row, the middle is between columns 4 and 5 (0-based indices 4 and 5). So mirroring column 2 (index 2) would be column 7 (since 9-2=7). So if a 1 is in column 2, then a 1 is also placed in column 7. In Example 0's output row 0, the original 1 is at 2, and a new 1 is at 6, which is not the mirror. So that theory doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 1s are propagated to the right. For example, in Example 0's input row 0 has a 1 at column 2, and the output adds one at column 6. So moving 4 columns to the right. But why 4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are copied to the same column in the row that's mirrored across the 5s. For example, row 0 (above) and row 9 (below), row 1 and row 8, etc. So if there's a 1 in row 0, column 2, then mirror it to row 9, column 2. But in Example 0's output, row 9 has 1s in columns 1 and 8, not 2. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's input, row 8 (which is row 8, below the 5s) has a 2 in column 5 and 1s in columns 1 and 8. The output row 9 has 1s in columns 1 and 8. So the 1s from row 8's columns 1 and 8 are copied to row 9. Maybe when there's a 1 in a row, it's copied to the row below (if possible). So in the input, row 8 has 1s, and they are copied to row 9.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's input row 8 has a 1 in column 6 and 8, and the output row 9 copies those 1s into column 6 and 8?\n\nWait, in Example 1's input row 8: [0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,1,0]. Output row 8 in Example 1 becomes [0,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,1,0]. Hmm, adding a 1 in column 4. Maybe not. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: for each cell in the input grid, if the cell is a 1 or 2, then in the output, that cell's value is propagated in some direction (vertical or horizontal) until it hits a boundary (like the 5s or the edge of the grid).\n\nFor example, in Example 0:\n\n- The 2s in row 2, columns 1 and 9 are propagated downward to rows 3 and 4, same columns. So vertically down until row 4 (since row 5 is 5s). So 2s are propagated downward until they hit the 5s row.\n\nSimilarly, the 2 in row 8, column 5 (in Example 0's input) is propagated upward to rows 6 and 7, column 5. So 2s below the 5s are propagated upward until the 5s row.\n\nFor the 1s:\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 0, column 2 has a 1. In the output, this 1 is present, and another 1 is added at column 6. How does column 6 relate to column 2? Maybe it's a horizontal propagation. Like, the 1 is spread to the right. But why from 2 to 6? Or maybe it's mirrored around the center of the row. For a row of 10 elements, the center is between columns 4 and 5. So column 2's mirror would be column 7 (since 9-2=7). But the output adds a 1 at column 6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1 in column 2 of row 0 is propagated to column 6 in the same row. The difference is 4. Maybe the row is split into two halves. For the first half (columns 0-4), the 1 is mirrored to the second half (columns 5-9). So column 2 in the first half would mirror to column 7 in the second half. But in Example 0's output, the 1 is added at column 6. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe each 1 in the first half is copied to the corresponding position in the second half. For example, column 0 \u2192 9, 1 \u2192 8, 2 \u21927, 3\u21926, 4\u21925. So column 2's mirror would be column 7. But Example 0's output adds a 1 at column 6. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1 in column 2 of row 0 is copied to the same column in the row that's mirrored across the 5s row. For example, row 0 (above the 5s) is mirrored to row 9 (below). So row 0's column 2 would mirror to row 9's column 2. But in Example 0's output, row 9 has 1s in columns 1 and 8, not 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are copied diagonally. For example, in Example 0's input, row 0, column 2 has a 1. The output adds a 1 in row 0, column 6. Maybe moving 4 columns to the right. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are being copied to the same row, but at a position that's the same distance from the 5s row. For example, row 0 is 5 rows away from the 5s row (row 5). So maybe the 1 in row 0 is copied to row 5 + (5-0) = row 10, which is out of bounds. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother idea: the 5s are a central row. So any number above the 5s is reflected down, and any number below is reflected up. For example, a 2 in row 2 (above) is reflected down to rows 3 and 4. A 2 in row 8 (below) is reflected up to rows 6 and 7.\n\nFor 1s, maybe they are reflected in their own rows. For example, in row 0 (above), the 1 is reflected in the same row but mirrored across the center. So column 2 would become column 7. But the output in Example 0 adds a 1 at column 6, which is not 7. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, let's look at the 1s in the outputs:\n\nIn Example 0's output, row 0 has 1s at 2 and 6. The original input's row 0 has a 1 at 2. The row 1 in input has a 1 at 6. So perhaps the output row 0 combines the 1s from row 0 and row 1? But how.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the entire grid, maybe each number in a cell is being propagated both vertically and horizontally. For example, a 2 in row 2, column 1 is propagated downward to rows 3 and 4. Similarly, a 2 in row 2, column 9 is propagated down. Then, a 1 in row 0, column 2 is propagated to the right until column 6, perhaps until it hits a 5 or another number. But in row 0, there are no 5s until row 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are being copied to the same row but in the opposite side of the 5s row. For example, row 0's 1 is copied to row 0's column 6 (since 5 is the middle row, column 5 would be the middle column). So column 2 is to the left of the middle, and column 6 is to the right. So mirroring around column 5.\n\nYes! Let's test this. For a row of 10 columns, the middle is between columns 4 and 5 (0-based indices). So mirroring around column 4.5. So the mirror of column i would be column 9 - i. For example:\n\nColumn 0 \u2194 9\n\nColumn 1 \u2194 8\n\nColumn 2 \u21947\n\nColumn 3 \u21946\n\nColumn 4 \u21945\n\nSo if a cell in column 2 has a 1, then the mirrored column 7 (9-2=7) would also get a 1. But in Example 0's output row 0, the original 1 is at column 2, and another 1 is added at column 6. Wait, 9-2=7, not 6. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s row (row 5) acts as a horizontal mirror. So rows above 5 are mirrored vertically to rows below. For example, row 0's content is mirrored to row 9, row 1 to 8, etc. So if there's a 1 in row 0, column 2, then row 9, column 2 would also have a 1. But in Example 0's output, row 9 has 1s in columns 1 and 8. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being copied both vertically and mirrored horizontally. For example, the 2 in row 2, column 1 is copied down to rows 3 and 4, and also mirrored to column 8 (9-1=8) in those rows. But in Example 0's output, rows 2,3,4 have 2s in columns 1 and 9. So 1 and 9 are mirrored. So that fits. Because 9-1=8, but maybe 9-1=8 is not the case here. Wait, 1 and 9 are not mirrors. Wait, 9-1=8. So column 1's mirror is column 8. But in Example 0's rows 2,3,4, columns 1 and 9 have 2s. So maybe the original 2s are in columns 1 and 9, which are themselves mirrors (since 9-1=8, but maybe not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s in columns 1 and 9 are placed there intentionally, and the mirroring is not a factor. Maybe each 2 in a column is copied down (if above 5s) or up (if below) until the 5s, and each 1 is copied to the mirrored column in the same row.\n\nSo for Example 0's row 0, the 1 in column 2 is mirrored to column 7 (9-2=7), but in the output, the new 1 is at column 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: let's compare the input and output for each example and see what changes.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nThe changes in the output are:\n\n- Row 0: added 1 at column 6.\n\n- Rows 3 and 4: added 2s in columns 1 and 9.\n\n- Rows 6 and 7: added 2s in column 5.\n\n- Row 9: added 1s in columns 1 and 8.\n\nLooking at where these added numbers come from:\n\nThe 2s in rows 3 and 4, columns 1 and 9 are probably copied from row 2, which has those 2s.\n\nThe 2s in rows 6 and 7, column 5 come from row 8, column 5 (since row 8 has a 2 there).\n\nThe added 1 in row 0, column 6 may come from row 1, column 6 (input row 1 has a 1 there).\n\nThe added 1s in row 9, columns 1 and 8 come from row 8, columns 1 and 8 (input row 8 has 1s there).\n\nSo perhaps the rule is:\n\nFor each cell in the input:\n\n- If it's a 2, then propagate it in the same column upwards or downwards until the 5s row. If the cell is above the 5s, propagate down; if below, propagate up.\n\n- If it's a 1, then copy it to the same column in the row above (if it's below the 5s) or below (if above the 5s), or perhaps to the mirrored column in the same row.\n\nWait, for the 1 in row 0, column 2 (above 5s), the output adds a 1 in column 6. Maybe that's the mirrored column (9-2=7, but 6 is not 7). Alternatively, it's copied from row 1, column 6. Because row 1, column 6 has a 1 in the input. So maybe the 1s are copied upwards from below the 5s or downwards from above. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s in the output are combinations of the 1s from above and below the 5s. For example, any 1 present in a column above the 5s is also placed in the corresponding mirrored column below the 5s, and vice versa.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0 has a 1 in column 2 (above 5s). The mirrored column would be 7 (9-2=7). In the output, row 0 has a 1 in column 6. That doesn't match. However, row 1 has a 1 in column 6 (input). So perhaps row 0's 1 is combined with row 1's 1.\n\nAlternatively, the output for row 0 is the combination of row 0 and row 9 (mirror row), but not sure.\n\nThis is getting really complicated. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in both examples, the 5s row remains unchanged, and acts as a barrier. So any numbers above can't pass through it, same for below.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput row 8 (below 5s) has a 2 in column 5. The output rows 6 and 7 (also below 5s) have 2 in column 5. So the 2 is propagating upwards from row 8 to rows 7 and 6.\n\nSimilarly, the 2 in row 2 (above 5s) is propagating down to rows 3 and 4.\n\nFor 1s:\n\nInput row 8 (below 5s) has 1s in columns 1 and 8. Output row 9 (below 5s) has 1s in those columns. So perhaps 1s are copied to the row immediately below if there's nothing blocking.\n\nBut in input row 0 (above 5s) has a 1 in column 2, and output row 0 adds a 1 in column 6. So perhaps when a 1 is in a row above the 5s, it's copied to the same row but on the opposite side (mirror column) and possibly also to the row below.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 1 in a row is copied to the same row's mirrored column, and each 2 is propagated vertically until the 5s.\n\nSo combining these rules:\n\n- For any cell with a 1: add a 1 in the mirrored column (9 - column index) in the same row.\n\n- For any cell with a 2: propagate the 2 in the same column downwards (if above 5s) or upwards (if below 5s) until the 5s row.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample 0 input row 0 has 1 at column 2. The mirrored column is 7. So output row 0 should have 1s at 2 and 7. But in the output, row 0 has 1 at 2 and 6. Doesn't match.\n\nExample 0 input row 8 has 1s at columns 1 and 8. Mirrored columns for 1 is 8 (9-1=8), and for 8 it's 1. So mirrored would be 8 and 1. But the output row 8 has 1s at 1 and 8. So in this case, it's the same as input. But output row 9 has 1s at 1 and 8. So perhaps the 1s are copied to the row below.\n\nSo maybe:\n\n- 1s are copied to the row below (if below the 5s) or above (if above) the 5s.\n\nBut in Example 0, row 0 is above 5s. So the 1 in row 0 is copied to row 1. But row 1 already has a 1 in column 6. No, in input row 1, there's a 1 in column 6, which is retained in output. So maybe not.\n\nAnother Idea: the 5s row is a horizontal line. Any number above the line is extended downward until the line, and any number below is extended upward until the line. Additionally, 1s are also mirrored horizontally across the vertical center (columns 4 and 5) of their row.\n\nSo for example, in row 0 (above 5s), a 1 in column 2 is extended downward to all rows below until the 5s, and also mirrored to column 7 (9-2=7). But in Example 0's output row 0, the 1 is at column 2 and 6. Hmm, not matching.\n\nBut the output in Example 0's row 0 has 1 at 2 and 6. The difference between 2 and 6 is 4. Maybe the mirroring is done around column 5. So column 2 is 3 positions left of 5 (columns 2,3,4,5), and mirrored would be column 8 (5 +3). Wait, 5 + (5-2) = 8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if mirroring around the center between columns 4 and 5, then the mirrored index would be (9 - current index). For example, column 0 \u21949, 1 \u21948, 2 \u21947, 3 \u21946, 4 \u21945.\n\nSo a 1 in column 2 would be mirrored to column 7. But in Example 0's output row 0, there's a 1 in column 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a number is mirrored, it's placed in the same row's mirrored column, and also in the mirrored row. For example, a 1 in row 0, column 2 would be mirrored to row 9, column 7. But Example 0's output row 9 has 1s in columns 1 and 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is taking too long. Let's try to see if there's a pattern that fits both examples.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\n- 2s are propagated vertically until the 5s row. So in row 2 (input) columns 1 and 9 have 2s, which are propagated down to rows 3 and 4.\n\n- The 2 in row 8 (input) column 5 is propagated up to rows 6 and 7.\n\n- The 1 in row 0 column 2 is added to column 6. The 1 in row 1 column 6 remains. Maybe the 1s are mirrored around the center column.\n\nWait, row 0 in output has 1 at 2 and 6. Columns 2 and 6 are symmetric around column 4.5 (midpoint between 4 and 5). So 4.5 - 2 = 2.5; 4.5 + 2.5 = 7. But 6 is one less than 7. Not sure.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 0 has a 2 in column 1 and a 1 in column 3. Output row 0 has 2 in column 1, 1 in column 3 and 1 in column 7. So the 1 in column 3 is mirrored to column 7 (9-3=6. Not 7. Wait, 9-3=6. So why 7? Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are copied to the same column in the row that's the mirror across the 5s. For example, row 0 is mirrored to row 9. So a 1 in row 0, column 2 would be copied to row 9, column 2. But in Example 0's output row 9, there's a 1 in column 1 and 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: For each row above the 5s, any 1s are copied to the same row but mirrored columns, and 2s are copied down. For rows below the 5s, any 1s are copied to the same row but mirrored columns, and 2s are copied up.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 0 (above 5s) has a 1 in column 2. Mirrored column would be 7. So output row 0 has 1 in 2 and 7? No, the output has 1 in 6. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think about the test input and see if applying a certain rule would give an answer.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nThe 5s are in row 4. So rows 0-3 are above, rows 5-9 are below.\n\nLooking for 1s and 2s:\n\nAbove 5s:\n\n- Row 1: columns 1 (2), 3 (1), 8 (2).\n\n- Row 2: column 6 (1).\n\nBelow 5s:\n\n- Row 7: columns 2 (1), 5 (2).\n\n- Row 8: column 0 (2).\n\n- Row 9: column 8 (1).\n\nSo, applying the possible rule where 2s are propagated vertically until the 5s, and 1s are mirrored in the same row.\n\nFor 2s:\n\nRow 1, columns 1 and 8 (above 5s). Propagate these down to rows 2, 3.\n\nRow 8, column 0 (below 5s). Propagate up to rows 5,6,7.\n\nRow 7, column 5 (2) (below 5s). Propagate up to row 5,6.\n\nFor 1s:\n\nRow 1, column 3: mirrored column would be 6 (9-3=6). So add a 1 in column 6.\n\nRow 2, column 6: mirrored column is 3. Add a 1 in column 3.\n\nRow 7, column 2: mirrored column is 7. Add a 1 in column 7.\n\nRow 9, column 8: mirrored column is 1. Add a 1 in column 1.\n\nBut also, 1s in rows below the 5s might be propagated down.\n\nWait, but according to the training examples, when a 1 is in a row below the 5s, it's copied to the row below. For example, in Example 0's row 8 (below 5s) has a 1, and row 9 (below) gets that 1. So perhaps, for 1s below the 5s, they are copied down to the next row, and mirrored.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's try to apply the possible rules to the test input.\n\nTest input's row 7 (below 5s) has a 1 at column 2 and a 2 at column 5. The 2 should propagate up to rows 5 and 6. The 1 at column 2 should be copied to row 8, column 2, and mirrored to column 7. But row 8 has a 2 in column 0. Not sure.\n\nRow 8 has a 2 at column 0 (below 5s). This 2 should propagate up to rows 5,6,7.\n\nRow 1's 2s at columns 1 and 8 (above 5s) should propagate down to rows 2 and 3.\n\nRow 2's 1 at column 6 (above 5s) should be mirrored to column 3 (9-6=3), so adding a 1 there.\n\nRow 9's 1 at column 8 (below 5s) should be copied to row 9's column 1 (mirror) and possibly propagated down, but row 9 is the last row. So maybe just mirror.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nFor the test input's output:\n\nRow 1's 2s at 1 and 8 are propagated down to rows 2 and 3. So rows 2 and 3 will have 2s in columns 1 and 8.\n\nRow 2's 1 at 6 is mirrored to column 3. So row 2 will have 1 at 3 and 6.\n\nRow 7's 2 at 5 is propagated up to rows 5 and 6. So rows 5 and 6 will have 2 at 5.\n\nRow 8's 2 at 0 is propagated up to rows 5,6,7. So those rows have 2 at 0.\n\nRow 7's 1 at 2 is mirrored to column 7. So row 7 has 1 at 2 and 7.\n\nRow 9's 1 at 8 is mirrored to column 1. So row 9 has 1 at 1 and 8.\n\nRow 1's 1 at 3 is mirrored to column 6. So row 1 has 1 at 3 and 6, but the input has 1 at 3, so output row 1 has 1 at 3 and 6.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nLet's build the output row by row.\n\nRow 0: All 0s in input, no changes unless mirrored from others. But nothing. So remains [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 1: Input has 2 at 1 and 8, 1 at 3. Output should propagate 2s down to rows 2 and 3. For the 1 at 3, mirror to column 6 (9-3=6). So row 1 becomes [0,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,2,0].\n\nRow 2: Input has 1 at 6. Propagate 2s from row 1 to columns 1 and 8. Also, mirror 6 to 3. So row 2 becomes [0,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,2,0].\n\nRow 3: Propagate 2s from row 1: columns 1 and 8. So row 3 becomes [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0].\n\nRow 4: 5s, unchanged.\n\nRow 5: Propagated 2s from row 7's column 5 (up) and row 8's column 0 (up). So row 5 has 2 at 0 and 5.\n\nRow 6: Same as row 5: 2s at 0 and 5.\n\nRow 7: Propagated 2s from row 8's column 0 (up) and row 7's own 2 at 5 (propagated up, but row 7 is the original. Also, the 1 at 2 is mirrored to 7. So row 7 becomes [0,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,0,0].\n\nRow 8: 2 at 0, propagated from row 8's input. So row 8 has 2 at 0. Also, any mirrored 1s?\n\nRow 9: 1 at 8, mirrored to 1. So [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0].\n\nPutting this all together, the output would look like:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,2,0]\n[0,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,2,0]\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n[2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n[2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,0,0]\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nBut wait, the rows below the 5s (rows 5-9) should have 2s from row 8's column 0 propagated up. So row 5 and 6 would have 2 at 0. Also, row 7's 2 at 5 is propagated up to rows 5 and 6. So rows 5 and 6 would have 2s at 0 and 5.\n\nRow 7 has its own 2 at 5, which would propagate up to rows 5 and 6.\n\nSo row 5 would have 2s at 0 and 5. Row 6 also same.\n\nRow 7's 2 at 5 is part of the original input, so it propagates up to rows 5 and 6.\n\nRow 8's 2 at 0 propagates up to rows 5,6,7.\n\nSo rows 5,6,7 have 2 at 0. Rows 5 and 6 also have 2 at 5 from row 7's 2.\n\nSo row 5 would be [2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 6: same as row 5.\n\nRow 7: [2,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,0,0].\n\nBut in the test input's row 7, the original is [0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. After propagation, the 2 at 5 would be in rows 5 and 6. The 2 from row 8's 0 would be in rows 5-7.\n\nSo row 7 would have 2 at 0 (from row 8's propagation) and 5 (original), plus 1 at 2 and 7 (mirror).\n\nSo row 7 becomes [2,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,0,0].\n\nBut in the training examples, the output rows below the 5s (like Example 0's rows 6 and 7) have 2s but not in the first column.\n\nHmm. But according to the pattern, the 2 in row 8's column 0 would propagate up to rows 5,6,7. So rows 5,6,7 would have 2 in column 0.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, the row 8's 2 in column 5 propagates up to rows 6 and 7, columns 5.\n\nSo applying this to the test input, rows 5,6,7 would have 2 in column 0 (from row 8's 2) and 5 (from row 7's 2).\n\nSo rows 5 and 6 would be:\n\nRow 5: [2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: same.\n\nRow 7: [2,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow 8: The original 2 in column 0, so it's propagated up, but since it's in row 8, which is below the 5s, the 2 would be propagated up to rows 5,6,7.\n\nSo row 8's output would have the original 2 in column 0. Also, any mirrored 1s? Row 7 has 1 in column 2 and 7 (mirror). So row 7's 1 at 2 is mirrored to 7. So row 7 becomes [2,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,0,0].\n\nRow 8's input is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So output would propagate 2 up, but itself remains 2. Also, any mirrored 1s? No, because there's no 1 in row 8's input. So row 8's output is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 9: input has 1 in column 8. Mirrored column is 1. So row 9's output is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0].\n\nPutting all together, the test output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n[0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the 2s are only propagated until the 5s row. So for row 8's 2 in column 0 (test input), which is below the 5s (row 4), propagating up would reach rows 5,6,7. So those rows have 2 in column 0. Similarly, the 2 in row 7's column 5 (test input) propagates up to rows 5 and 6.\n\nSo the rows 5,6,7 columns 0 and 5 have 2s.\n\nThe 1s are mirrored in their own rows. So row 1's 1 at 3 is mirrored to 6 (9-3=6?), row 2's 1 at 6 is mirrored to 3, row 7's 1 at 2 is mirrored to 7 (9-2=7?), and row 9's 1 at 8 is mirrored to 1.\n\nBut this seems to fit. Now, comparing to the training examples, this seems to follow the pattern where 2s are propagated vertically until the 5s row, and 1s are mirrored in their own rows. Also, any 1s below the 5s are copied to the row below, like in Example 0's row 8's 1s copied to row 9.\n\nSo applying this to the test input, the output should look like the one above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, there's a transformation from input to output. Let me start by examining the first example.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the fifth row (index 4) is all zeros, and the sixth row (index 5) is all 5s. In the output, the rows above the 5s (indices 3 and 4) now have 2s at the ends. Also, the row below the 5s (index 6) has a 2 in the fifth position. Wait, no, looking at the output for Example 0, rows 3 and 4 (originally zeros) have 2s in positions 1 and 9, same as row 2. The row below the 5s (index 6) now has a 2 in position 5. Hmm, maybe there's something with the rows adjacent to the 5s.\n\nLooking at the second example, the input has the 5s in row 3. In the output, rows 2 and 4 (around the 5s) have 2s in certain positions. Wait, row 4 in the output of Example 1 has 2s in positions 1, 5, 7, 9. But the input row 5 (which is the one after the 5s) in Example 1's input is [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. The output for row 4 (index 4) is [0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2]. So maybe the 5s row acts as a mirror or propagates values upwards and downwards.\n\nAnother observation: in the outputs, the 5s row remains the same. The rows above and below the 5s seem to be modified. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 5s are in row 5 (0-based index 5). The output rows above (index 3 and 4) now have 2s where row 2 has 2s. Similarly, the rows below (indices 6 and 7) have 2s in position 5. Wait, original row 2 in input has 2s at positions 1 and 9 (0-based index 1 and 9). Then rows 3 and 4 in the output copy those 2s. For the rows below the 5s, row 6 and 7 in the output have a 2 in position 5. Where does that come from? Looking at input row 8 (index 8), which has a 2 in position 5. So maybe the rows adjacent to the 5s copy certain values from rows further away.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s row is a barrier, and elements above and below are being mirrored or propagated towards it. Let's check the first example's input and output.\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 8 (index 8) has 1s in positions 1 and 8, and a 2 in position 5. The output row 9 (index 9) has 1s in positions 1 and 8. So perhaps the rows adjacent to the 5s take the values from the rows that are two positions away, but mirrored. For example, row 5 (5s) is in the middle. The rows above (like row 3 and 4) might copy from row 2. The rows below (6 and 7) copy from row 8. And the row after that (row 9) copies from row 8 but maybe adjusted.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, rows 3 and 4 are copies of row 2 (since they have 2s in the same positions). Then rows 6 and 7 have 2s in position 5, which is the same as row 8's position 5. Then row 9 in the output is similar to row 8 but without the 2. So maybe the rule is that the rows immediately adjacent to the 5s (above and below) take the values from the rows two steps away from the 5s. For example, in Example 0, the 5s are in row 5. The rows above (4 and 3) would take from row 2 (5-3=2), and rows below (6 and 7) take from row 8 (5+3=8). But 5-3 is 2, and 5+3 is 8. Then rows 3 and 4 (which are 2 and 1 steps above the 5s) copy from row 2. Similarly, rows 6 and 7 (1 and 2 steps below) copy from row 8.\n\nBut how does this work for the second example?\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 5s are in row 3 (index 3). The rows above (indices 1,2) and below (4,5). Let's see. The output rows 2 and 4 are modified. Looking at the input, row 5 (index5) in the input is [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. The output row4 (index4) is [0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2]. So maybe row4 is combining values from row5 (input) and something else. Or maybe the rows below the 5s (indices4 and5) are taking from row5 and row6. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that for rows above the 5s, copy from the row that's two rows above the 5s, and for rows below, copy from the row two rows below. For example, in Example0, the 5s are at row5. Two rows above is row3, but in the output, rows3 and4 are copies of row2. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the vertical alignment. The 5s row is a solid line. Then, any numbers that are in the same column as numbers above and below the 5s row are copied or mirrored. But that doesn't explain the 2s appearing in rows 3 and4 of Example0's output.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for specific changes from input to output in each example.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nInput row0: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput row0: [0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] \u2192 the 1 is copied from row8 (input row8 has 1 in position1 and8, but output row0 has 1 in position6. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the 5s act as a mirror. So elements above the 5s row are mirrored downwards, and elements below are mirrored upwards. For example, in Example0, the 5s are at row5. The row above is row4 (originally all zeros), and in output, it's modified to have 2s in positions1 and9, same as row2. Similarly, the rows below the 5s (row6 and7) have 2s in position5, which comes from row8's position5 (which is 2). So maybe the rows adjacent to the 5s row (both above and below) take the elements from the row that's two steps away from the 5s. For example, row5-2=3 (but in example0, the rows above 5 are 3 and4, which in the output copy row2's elements. Wait, row5-3=2. So perhaps rows that are two steps away from the 5s row influence the adjacent rows.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that for each row adjacent to the 5s row (both above and below), they take the values from the row that's three steps away. For example, row5-3=2 (so above) and row5+3=8 (below). Then, the rows immediately above and below the 5s (like row4 and row6) take values from row2 and row8 respectively. Then, the next rows (row3 and row7) take from row2 and row8 again. Wait, in Example0, the 5s are in row5. The rows above are rows0-4. The output rows3 and4 (indices3 and4) are copies of row2. So rows3 and4 (which are 2 and3 steps above the 5s) take from row2 (which is 3 steps above 5). Similarly, rows6 and7 (indices6 and7, 1 and2 steps below 5) take from row8 (index8, which is 3 steps below 5). So the pattern could be that for each row within two steps above or below the 5s row, they copy the values from the row that is three steps away from the 5s row.\n\nWait, 5s are at row5. Three steps above would be row2. Three steps below would be row8. So rows3 and4 (two steps and one step above) are filled with row2's values. Similarly, rows6 and7 (one and two steps below) are filled with row8's values. Then, the rows beyond that (like row1) may have other patterns. But in Example0's output, row0 has an additional 1 in position6. Hmm. How does that happen?\n\nLooking at row0's input: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Output row0: [0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. So a new 1 appears in position6. Where could that come from? Maybe from another row. Let's check row8's input: [0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0]. The output row9 is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]. So perhaps the 2 in row8's position5 is copied to the rows below the 5s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1 in row0's output comes from row8's position1. Because row8 has 1 in position1, and row0's output has 1 in position6. Not sure. This might be a stretch.\n\nAnother angle: Let's check the positions where the numbers change from input to output. For example, in Example0's output row0, a 1 is added at position6. Looking at other rows, perhaps the numbers are being propagated vertically towards the 5s row, and then mirrored. For instance, if there's a number above the 5s, it's copied down to the rows adjacent to the 5s, and similarly for numbers below.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the 5s act as a reflecting line. Elements above the 5s are mirrored downward, and elements below are mirrored upward. But how?\n\nIn Example0, row8 has a 2 at position5. The rows below the 5s (rows6 and7) in the output have 2s at position5. So maybe the 2 is mirrored upward across the 5s. But the 5s are in row5, so the distance from row8 to 5s is 3 rows. Then mirroring would place it at row5 - (8-5) = row2. But row2 in input has 2s at 1 and9, not at5. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the rows adjacent to the 5s (above and below) take the maximum value from the corresponding column in their respective directions. For example, for rows above the 5s, take the maximum value from the columns in the rows above, and same for below. But in Example0's row3 and4 in the output, they have 2s which come from row2. So maybe it's taking the highest non-zero value from the columns above the 5s.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation might involve copying certain elements from specific rows above and below the 5s line. For example, rows immediately above the 5s (row4 in Example0) take elements from row2, and the next row above (row3) also takes from row2. Similarly, rows below take from row8. So the rule is: for all rows within two steps above the 5s row, replace them with row (5 - 3) = row2. For rows within two steps below, replace with row (5 +3) = row8. Then, for rows further away, maybe other rules.\n\nTesting this hypothesis: In Example0, rows3 and4 (two and one step above 5) are replaced by row2's values. Rows6 and7 (one and two steps below 5) are replaced by row8's values. Let's check:\n\nRow2 in Example0's input is [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. So rows3 and4 in the output are copies of this. Yes, output rows3 and4 are [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. That matches.\n\nRow8 in Example0's input is [0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0]. So rows6 and7 in the output would be copies of this. But output rows6 and7 are [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0] and same for row7. Wait, but row8's position5 is 2, which is copied to rows6 and7's position5. Other elements are 0. So maybe it's only the elements from row8's non-zero positions that are copied to rows6 and7. But row8 has non-zero at 1,5,8. However, rows6 and7 in output have 2 only at position5. So perhaps only the 2 from position5 is copied. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is that for the rows adjacent to the 5s (two steps above and two steps below), copy non-zero elements from specific rows. Let's think again.\n\nIn Example1's input, the 5s are in row3. So the rows two steps above would be row1 (3-2=1), and two steps below would be row5 (3+2=5). The output rows1,2 and4,5 are modified. For instance, output row1 is [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0]. Input row1 is [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0]. The 2 in position5 (input) is now in position5 and 1 (output row1). Wait, the output row1 has 2 in position1 and5. Where does that come from? Maybe the rows two steps above and below are being mirrored. Row3-2=1. So for rows above the 5s (rows1 and2), they copy from row1 (input), but perhaps with some transformation. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example1's output, the rows above the 5s (rows1 and2) have 2s in certain positions. Row1 in output has 2s in position1 and5. Input row1 has a 2 in position5 and 1 in position7. The output row1 has 2 in position1 and5, and 1 in position7. The 2 in position1 might be from row5's input. Let's see: input row5 is [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. So position1 and9 are 2. The output row1's position1 is 2, which could be copied from row5's position1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the rows above the 5s take the values from the row two steps below the 5s. For example, in Example0, 5s are at row5. The rows above (3,4) take from row5+2=7? But row7 is all zeros. That doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's look for common transformations in both examples.\n\nIn both examples, the 5s row remains the same. The rows immediately adjacent to the 5s row (both above and below) are modified. The modifications include adding 2s and 1s in specific positions.\n\nLooking at Example0's input and output:\n\nThe 5s are in row5. The output rows3 and4 (two rows above) have 2s in positions1 and9, same as row2's input. The rows6 and7 (two rows below) have a 2 in position5, which matches row8's input position5. The output row0 has an added 1 in position6, which might correspond to row8's position8 (which is 1). But how?\n\nIn Example1's input, 5s are in row3. The output rows1 and2 (two rows above and one row above) have 2s. For example, output row2 has 2s in positions1 and5, which might be from row5's input. Input row5 is [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. Output row2 in Example1 is [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. So position1 has 2 (copied from row5's position1) and position5 has 2 (copied from row5's position5?). Wait, input row5's position5 is 0. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in Example1's output, the rows below the 5s (rows4 and5) have 2s in positions1,5,7,9 (row4) and same for row5. Input row5 (original row5) has 2s in positions1 and9. So maybe the rows below the 5s (rows4 and5) take the 2s from row5 and add some. Or perhaps the rows adjacent to the 5s are filled with 2s from the nearest non-zero row in their direction.\n\nAnother pattern: the 2s in the output seem to be propagating vertically towards the 5s row. For example, in Example0, row2 has 2s. The rows above the 5s (rows3 and4) copy those 2s. The row8 has a 2 in position5. The rows below (6 and7) copy that 2. Similarly, in Example1, the rows around the 5s (row3) have 2s that might come from row5 (input row5 has 2s). So the rule could be: for rows above the 5s, copy the highest non-zero elements from the rows above the 5s, and for rows below, copy from the rows below.\n\nWait, in Example0, row2 is three rows above the 5s (row5). So rows3 and4 (which are two and one steps above) copy row2's 2s. Similarly, in Example1, row5 is two rows below the 5s (row3). So rows4 and5 (one and two steps below) copy row5's 2s. That seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n1. Find the row with all 5s (the 5s row).\n2. For all rows that are one or two steps above the 5s row (i.e., if 5s are in row N, then rows N-1 and N-2), replace them with the values from the row three steps above the 5s row (N-3).\n3. For all rows that are one or two steps below the 5s row (N+1 and N+2), replace them with the values from the row three steps below the 5s row (N+3).\n4. If the three steps above or below go beyond the grid (e.g., N-3 is negative), maybe wrap around or ignore. But in the examples, N-3 seems valid.\n\nTesting this with Example0:\n\n5s row is row5. So rows3 and4 (N-2=3 and N-1=4) are replaced with row5-3=2. Row2's values are [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2], which matches the output rows3 and4.\n\nFor rows below, rows6 and7 (N+1 and N+2) are replaced with row5+3=8. Row8's input is [0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0]. The output rows6 and7 are [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. So it seems like they take the 2 from position5 of row8 and set it in position5 of rows6 and7. Other elements are zero. So maybe only certain elements are copied. Or perhaps only the non-zero elements from the three-step row are copied.\n\nBut in Example0's output rows6 and7, only the 2 in position5 is present, which is from row8's position5. The other positions are zeros. So perhaps the rule is: for each row that is one or two steps above/below the 5s row, copy non-zero elements from the three-step row. But if the three-step row has a non-zero in a position, copy it; otherwise, leave as zero.\n\nIn Example0's case, row8 has non-zeros in positions1,5,8. But rows6 and7 only have 2 in position5. So why aren't the 1s copied? Hmm. Maybe only 2s are considered? Or maybe only the first non-zero in each column is copied, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s row acts as a mirror, and elements from three steps away are mirrored across it. For example, elements three steps above are mirrored into the two steps above the 5s, and elements three steps below are mirrored into the two steps below.\n\nIn Example0, the three steps above row5 is row2. Row2's non-zero elements are at positions1 and9. These are mirrored into rows3 and4. The three steps below row5 is row8. Row8's non-zero elements are at positions1,5,8. But in rows6 and7, only position5 has a 2. So perhaps only the elements in the same column as the 5s row's midpoint are mirrored. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s row's columns are considered, and for each column, if there's a non-zero element three steps above, it's copied to the two steps above, and same for below.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that the rows adjacent to the 5s (up to two steps) take the values from the rows that are three steps away, but only if those rows have non-zero values. Otherwise, they remain zero.\n\nIn Example0's rows3 and4, they copied row2's 2s. In Example1's rows1 and2 (which are two steps above the 5s row3), the three steps above would be row0. But row0's input is [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So output rows1 and2 would take from row0's values. But in Example1's output, row1 is [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0]. The 2 in position1 and5. Row0's input has 2 in position1 and 1 in position3. So the output row1's 2 in position1 comes from row0, but where does the 2 in position5 come from? Maybe from row5's input, which has 2 in position5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to apply the pattern I hypothesized to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5] \u2190 5s row is index4\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nFirst, identify the 5s row. It's row4 (0-based index4). So three steps above would be row1 (4-3=1), and three steps below would be row7 (4+3=7).\n\nFor the rows above the 5s (indices2 and3, which are two and one steps above), we need to copy row1's values. So rows2 and3 in the output should be copies of row1's input. Wait, but row1 in input is [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0]. So rows2 and3 would become [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0]. Let's check the test input's row2 and3. Input row2 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], so in output, they would be replaced with row1's values.\n\nBut wait, according to the pattern, three steps above is row1. So rows2 and3 (which are 4-2=2 and 4-1=3) would take values from row1. So output row2 would be row1's input, and output row3 would also be row1's input. But in the test input, row3 is all zeros. So the output for rows2 and3 should be [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0].\n\nThen, for the rows below the 5s row (indices5 and6, which are one and two steps below), they should copy from row7 (4+3=7). Input row7 is [0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. So rows5 and6 in the output would be copies of this row. So row5 and6 would be [0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0].\n\nAdditionally, looking at the other rows:\n\nRow0 and row9 might have changes. For example, in Example0, row0 was modified by adding a 1 from somewhere. Perhaps there's another rule for rows further away.\n\nBut in the test input, row7 is the three steps below. So rows5 and6 (steps 1 and2 below) copy row7. Then row8 is three steps below plus one more. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlso, the rows beyond the two steps (like row0, row1, row8, row9) might have their own changes. For example, in Example0, row0 gained a 1 in position6. Perhaps this comes from row8's position8, but mirrored.\n\nIn the test input, row8 is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So three steps below the 5s row (row4+3=7) is row7, which is [0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. Then rows5 and6 are copies of row7. So rows5 and6 in output would be [0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow9 in the input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]. According to Example0's pattern, row9 in the output would be similar to row7's input. Or maybe row9 is three steps below the 5s (row4+3=7), so row9 would copy from row7. But row9 is two steps below row7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe row9 is modified based on row8. For example, in Example0's row9, it's a copy of row8 but with the 2 removed. So for the test input's row9, maybe it's a copy of row8's input, which is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but modified somehow. But in Example1's output, row9 is [0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0], which seems to be a combination of other rows.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Let's try to apply the initial pattern for the test input:\n\n- 5s row is index4.\n- Rows2 and3 (above) copy from row1 (index4-3=1).\n- Rows5 and6 (below) copy from row7 (index4+3=7).\n- So output rows2 and3 are [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0].\n- Output rows5 and6 are [0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0].\n- The 5s row remains the same.\n- Other rows (0,1,7,8,9) may have changes based on other rules.\n\nBut let's look for other possible patterns. For instance, in Example0, the output row0 has an added 1 in position6. Input row0's original row0 has a 1 in position2. The output row0's 1 is in position6. That's the same as the original row8's position8 (1), but mirrored around the center. For a 10-element row, the center is between positions4 and5. So mirroring position2 (index2) would be position7 (index7), but in Example0's output, it's position6. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, it's about vertical reflection. The 5s row is the mirror line. So elements above are mirrored below. But in Example0's row0, the 1 in position2 is mirrored to position8 (index8) which is row0's index8. But output row0's index6 has a 1, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are propagated downwards. For example, any non-zero in a row above the 5s is copied down to the corresponding position in the row below the 5s. But that doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the possible pattern, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial hypothesis: rows two steps above and below the 5s are replaced with the rows three steps away.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\n5s row is index4.\n\nRows2 and3 (steps 2 and1 above) take from row1 (index1).\n\nRows5 and6 (steps 1 and2 below) take from row7 (index7).\n\nRow1 in the input is [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0], so rows2 and3 become this.\n\nRow7 in input is [0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0], so rows5 and6 become this.\n\nNow, what about other rows? For example, row8 in the input is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. According to Example0's pattern, row9 might copy from row8's input. But in Example0's output, row9 is a modified version of row8's input. For example, row8's input has 2 in position5, but row9's output in Example0 has 0 there. So perhaps row9 is a copy of row8's input, but some elements are removed. Or perhaps it's a different pattern.\n\nIn the test input's row8, there's a 2 in position0. Maybe this 2 is copied to row9's position0. But row9's input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]. So output row9 might become [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0], but this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, row9 could be left as is, but according to the examples, there's some modification. For example, in Example0's output, row9 is modified from input row8. Similarly, in Example1's output, row9 is modified from input row8 and others.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, perhaps the main changes are in the rows around the 5s. So for the test input, the output would be:\n\nRows2 and3 become [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0].\n\nRows5 and6 become [0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0].\n\nOther rows remain as input unless there's another rule.\n\nBut looking at the examples, there are other changes. For instance, in Example0's output row0 is modified. Maybe there's another rule where certain rows further away from the 5s also get modified based on other rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows adjacent to the rows we've already modified also need to be updated. For example, row1 in the test input is [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0]. If rows2 and3 are copies of row1, maybe row1 itself is also modified. But in Example0's input, row2 was copied to rows3 and4, and row2 itself remained unchanged in the output.\n\nHmm. Let's proceed with the main changes and see if that matches the examples.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nThe 5s row is index4.\n\nRows2 and3 (above) become copies of row1.\n\nRows5 and6 (below) become copies of row7.\n\nRow7's input is [0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0], so rows5 and6 become this.\n\nRow1's input is [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0], so rows2 and3 become this.\n\nNow, other rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 maybe it remains the same. But in Example0's output, row0 was modified. But in Example0's input, row0 had a 1 in position2, and in output, it gained a 1 in position6. How?\n\nIn Example0's input row8 (three steps below 5s) had a 2 in position5, which was copied to rows6 and7. But row0's change might be from row8's position8 (which was 1 in Example0). So perhaps rows three steps above the 5s (row1) influence the rows further away. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a second part to the pattern: after copying the three-step rows, certain other elements are copied or moved.\n\nBut given time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial pattern for the test input and see.\n\nSo applying this:\n\nTest input's output would have:\n\nRow0: same as input \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: same as input \u2192 [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow2: becomes row1's input \u2192 [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow3: becomes row1's input \u2192 [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow4: remains 5s \u2192 [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow5: becomes row7's input \u2192 [0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: becomes row7's input \u2192 [0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: same as input \u2192 [0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: same as input \u2192 [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: same as input \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nBut looking at Example0's output, row9 was modified from input row9. So perhaps there's another rule for the row three steps below (row7 in test case). But in Example0, row9 is three steps below the 5s row5 (5+3=8, row8 is three steps below, and row9 is four steps below). So maybe row9 is copied from row8's input. For test case's row9, which is three steps below row4 (4+3=7, row7 is three steps below. Row9 is two steps below row7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps row9 is modified based on row8. For example, in Example0's output row9 is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0], which is similar to row8's input [0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0], but with the 2 removed. So in test input's row8 is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Maybe row9's output is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But in Example0, row9's output is different from row8's input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe row9 is a copy of row8's input shifted somehow. But without a clear pattern, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the main changes are rows2,3,5,6. But looking at the training examples, there are other changes. For example, in Example0's output row0 had an added 1, and row9 had changes. So perhaps there's another layer to the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire grid is mirrored vertically around the 5s row, with certain exceptions. For example, elements above are mirrored below, and vice versa, but with some modifications.\n\nIn Example0's input, row8 (three steps below) has a 2 in position5. In the output, rows6 and7 (one and two steps below) have 2 in position5. So it's like the 2 is moved up towards the 5s row. Similarly, row2's 2s are moved down to rows3 and4. So it's as if non-zero elements are being pulled towards the 5s row, up to two steps away.\n\nSo for each non-zero element in rows three steps above or below the 5s row, copy them to the two steps adjacent rows towards the 5s.\n\nSo for the test input's row1 (three steps above 5s row4), the non-zeros are at positions1,3,8. These would be copied to rows2 and3 (two steps above). So rows2 and3 would have 2 at position1, 1 at position3, and 2 at position8.\n\nSimilarly, row7 (three steps below 5s row4) has non-zeros at positions2 and5. These would be copied to rows5 and6 (two steps below), so they have 1 at position2 and 2 at position5.\n\nNow, what about other rows? For example, row8 in the test input has a 2 at position0. Three steps below row4 is row7, so row8 is four steps below. So maybe the rule is only for three steps away. So row8's 2 is not copied. Similarly, row9's 1 is three steps below row7 (row7 is three steps below row4; row9 is two steps below row7), which doesn't fit the pattern.\n\nThis seems to align with the examples. For Example0:\n\nRow2 (three steps above 5s row5) has 2s at positions1 and9. Copied to rows3 and4.\n\nRow8 (three steps below) has 2 at position5. Copied to rows6 and7.\n\nNow, for the test input:\n\nRow1 (three steps above 5s row4) has non-zeros at positions1 (2),3 (1), and8 (2). These are copied to rows2 and3.\n\nRow7 (three steps below) has non-zeros at positions2 (1) and5 (2). These are copied to rows5 and6.\n\nSo the output rows:\n\nRow2: [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nOther rows remain unchanged unless there's another rule.\n\nAdditionally, in Example0's output, row0 has an additional 1 in position6. This might be due to a different rule. Looking at row8 in Example0's input, which is three steps below the 5s row, has a 1 in position8. The output row0's position6 is 1. Perhaps there's a diagonal or symmetric copy. The 5s row is at row5. Position8 in row8 is mirrored across the 5s row to position1 (since row5 is the midpoint between row2 and row8. Row8's position8 (index9) is mirrored to row0's position0 (index0). Not sure. Alternatively, row8's position8 is index8, which is mirrored to row0's index1 (5- (8-5) = 2, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps non-zero elements three steps below are copied to the corresponding position three steps above, and vice versa. For example, in Example0's row8's position5 (three steps below) is copied to row2's position5 (three steps above), but row2's position5 is 0. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time I have, I'll proceed with the initial pattern for the test input.",
