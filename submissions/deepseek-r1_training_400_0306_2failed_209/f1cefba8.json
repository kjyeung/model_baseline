        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input is transformed into the output. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, there's a structure made mostly of 8s and some 2s in the middle. The output seems to have some 2s added in the top and bottom rows. Specifically, the top and bottom rows now have 2s in positions that were 0s before. Also, looking at the middle part, some of the 2s in the input are replaced with 8s, creating a kind of checkerboard or alternating pattern. For instance, in the rows where there were consecutive 2s, they alternate with 8s in the output. Also, the central column or row might be a point of symmetry. The middle row (row 6 in the input) has a lot of 2s, and in the output, that row becomes all 8s except the first and last elements which are 2. So maybe there's a transformation where certain lines or regions are replaced with the surrounding number, except at specific intervals.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has 1s and 4s. The output adds 4s in the top and bottom rows, similar to how 2s were added in Example 0. The middle part of the output has some 4s arranged in a pattern. For example, the row that had a lot of 4s in the input now has some 1s inserted, creating a break. Also, there's a row in the output where 4s are added on the edges. The transformation here might involve inserting the lower-numbered value (like 1) into regions of higher numbers (4) in a certain pattern, perhaps along lines of symmetry or specific positions.\n\nExample 2's input has 2s and 3s. The output adds 3s in the top and bottom rows again. The middle sections have some 3s replaced with 2s. There's a row that becomes all 2s with 3s at the ends. So the pattern seems consistent: the number that is present in the inner structure (like 2 in Ex0, 4 in Ex1, 3 in Ex2) is being added to the borders, and the inner regions are being modified by replacing certain instances of that number with the surrounding value (like 8 in Ex0, 1 in Ex1, 2 in Ex2) in a pattern that creates gaps or alternations.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern might be:\n\n1. Identify the \"inner\" number (the one that's surrounded by another number). In Ex0, the inner number is 2 (surrounded by 8s), in Ex1 it's 4 (surrounded by 1s), in Ex2 it's 3 (surrounded by 2s). The test input has 8s surrounded by 1s, so the inner number would be 8.\n\n2. In the output, add the inner number (8 in the test case) to certain positions in the top and bottom rows where there were 0s. The positions might be at specific intervals. For example, in Ex0, the 2s are added at positions 4 and 7 in the top rows. In Ex1, 4s are added at positions 6 and 8. In Ex2, 3s are at position 11. Maybe it's the middle column(s) of the structure? Let me check the positions.\n\nIn Ex0's input, the structure is 13 columns wide. The middle is column 6 (0-based index 6). The output has 2s at positions 4 and 7 in the top rows. Wait, maybe it's symmetry. For Ex0, the 2s in the output's top rows are at positions 4 and 7 (assuming 0-based). The middle is 6, so 4 and 7 are two away from the center. Hmm, maybe not. Let me count:\n\nLooking at Ex0's input, the 2 is at position 7 in row 3 (0-based). The output's top rows have 2s at positions 4 and 7. Wait, perhaps the positions correspond to where the inner structure's elements are. Or maybe it's the columns where the inner number is present in the middle rows.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs for the training examples, the added numbers in the top and bottom rows are placed in positions that might correspond to the horizontal center of the structure. For example, in Ex0, the structure is 13 columns. The middle is column 6 (0-based index 6). The output adds 2s at columns 4 and 7. Wait, maybe it's the left and right of the center. 6-2=4 and 6+1=7? Not sure. Ex1's output adds 4s at positions 6 and 8. The input's structure is 17 columns. Middle would be 8.5, so perhaps positions 6 and 8 (but not sure). Ex2 adds 3s at position 11. The input structure is 18 columns, middle at 8.5, but 11 is towards the end. Maybe this is not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, the number of added elements in the top and bottom rows might correspond to the width of the inner structure. For example, in Ex0, the inner 2s are in a region that's 9 columns wide (from column 1 to 11, but the actual structure is 13 columns with 0s around). The output adds two 2s per row. In Ex1, the 4s in the output's top rows have two 4s as well. Ex2 adds a single 3 in the top rows. Hmm, maybe it's the number of times the inner number appears in the middle row? Or maybe the positions are determined by the original input's structure.\n\nAnother angle: the transformation might be to invert certain regions. For example, in Ex0, the regions that were filled with 2s in the input are now replaced with 8s except for certain lines, creating a stripe or cross. The output might be creating a cross shape with the inner number. Looking at Ex0's output, the middle row (row 6) is all 8s except the first and last elements which are 2. Also, the vertical line through the center (column 6) might have 2s. Wait, in Ex0's output, rows 0 and 1 have 2s at positions 4 and 7, and rows 15-18 have 2s at positions 4 and 7. Maybe these positions correspond to the vertical lines where the original structure had 2s in the input's middle rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is creating a border around the original structure using the inner number. For example, in Ex0, the 2s are added around the top and bottom edges. But in the test case, the inner number is 8, so maybe the output will have 8s added to the top and bottom rows.\n\nWait, looking at the test input's structure: the main structure is made of 1s and 8s. The 8s form a region surrounded by 1s. So according to previous examples, the inner number is 8. The output should replace certain 1s in the middle with 8s in a pattern, and add 8s to the top and bottom rows where there were 0s.\n\nWait, in the training examples, the output adds the inner number to the borders (top and bottom rows that were originally 0s). For example, Ex0 adds 2s to the top and bottom, Ex1 adds 4s, Ex2 adds 3s. So in the test case, the inner number is 8, so the top and bottom rows (which are all 0s in the test input) would have 8s added in certain positions.\n\nLooking at the positions where the inner number is added in the training examples:\n\nEx0's output top rows have 2s at positions 4 and 7. The input's structure for Ex0 has a middle row where 2s are in columns 3-9 (approx). The output's added 2s might be aligned with the left and right edges of the inner structure. For Ex0, the inner 2 structure starts at column 3 (0-based) and ends at column 9. The middle is at column 6. The added 2s in the top are at columns 4 and 7, which are one step in from the start and end.\n\nEx1's output adds 4s at columns 6 and 8. The inner 4 structure in Ex1 starts around column 5 (input row 6: columns 5-10 for 4s), so the middle is around column 7.5. The added 4s are at 6 and 8, which are around the middle.\n\nEx2's output adds 3s at column 11. The inner 3 structure in Ex2's input starts at column 5 (row 5, columns 6-13 for 3s). The middle of that might be around column 9.5. The added 3s are at column 11, which is towards the end. Hmm, maybe not directly aligned. Alternatively, perhaps the added numbers are placed at the position of the original single occurrence of the inner number in the input. For example, in Ex0, there's a single 2 in row 3, column 7. The output adds 2s in the top rows at columns 4 and 7. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the added numbers in the top and bottom rows are placed symmetrically. For example, in Ex0, the top rows have 2s at positions 4 and 7 (assuming 0-based), which are symmetric around the center column (6). 4 and 7 are 6-2 and 6+1, which might not be exact symmetry. Ex1's top rows have 4s at positions 6 and 8 (17 columns, center at 8.5). 6 and 8 are symmetric around 7, not exactly. Maybe it's based on the width of the structure. For example, Ex0's structure is 11 columns wide (from column 1 to 11), so the added 2s are at positions that split that width. 11 columns would have a center at 5.5 (0-based 1-11 is 11 elements, middle at 5.5). So positions 4 and 7 (5.5 -1.5 and 5.5 +1.5). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the added positions are the first and last occurrence of the inner number in the middle row. For Ex0, the middle row (row 6 in input) has 2s from column 3 to 10. The first occurrence is column 3, last is 10. But the output adds 2s at columns 4 and 7. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input's structure, the 8s are in rows 4 to 13, columns 3 to 12 (approx). The middle column would be around column 7.5 (columns 3-12 is 10 columns, middle at 7.5). So perhaps the test output's top rows will have 8s added at columns 6 and 8 (around the middle) similar to Ex1's pattern. Or maybe columns 5 and 10, based on the structure's edges.\n\nBut maybe the key is that in the output, the added numbers in the borders (top and bottom) are placed in positions where the original structure's vertical lines would be. For example, in Ex0, the vertical line through the center of the 2s in the input (column 7) has a single 2. The output adds 2s in the top rows at columns 4 and 7. Maybe the 4 and 7 correspond to some symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is creating a cross shape. For example, in Ex0's output, the middle row is all 8s except the ends, which are 2. And there are vertical lines of 2s in the middle columns. So it's a cross made of the inner number (2) overlaid on the original structure.\n\nBut how does this apply to the test input? The test input has a block of 8s surrounded by 1s. The output would create a cross of 8s in the middle, and add 8s to the top and bottom rows. Wait, but the original top and bottom rows are 0s, so adding 8s there would make sense. Also, the middle rows of the structure (which are 8s in the test input) might have some 1s inserted to form a cross.\n\nWait, looking at the other examples, in Ex1's output, the middle rows have some 4s replaced with 1s. For example, the input row 6 in Ex1 is [0, 0, 1, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,0,0,0]. The output row 6 is [0,0,1,1,4,4,1,4,1,4,4,4,1,1,0,0,0]. So in the middle of the 4s, they insert 1s. Similarly, in Ex0's output, the middle rows have 2s replaced with 8s in a pattern. So maybe the cross pattern is formed by inserting the surrounding number (the outer number) into the inner structure along vertical and horizontal lines.\n\nFor the test input, the inner number is 8 (surrounded by 1s). The cross pattern would involve inserting 1s into the 8 structure along the vertical and horizontal middle lines. So in the middle row of the 8s, replace every other 8 with 1, creating a cross. Then, in the top and bottom 0 rows, add 8s at positions corresponding to the cross's vertical line.\n\nSo for the test input, the output's top and bottom rows (which are 0s) would have 8s added at positions that align with the vertical center of the 8 structure. The middle of the 8 structure is around column 8 (since the 8s in row 4 are at columns 5 and 10, so the middle is (5+10)/2=7.5, so columns 7 and 8? Or maybe columns 8 and 9? Wait, in row 4 of the test input: columns 5 and 10 have 8s. Let's see the exact positions.\n\nLooking at the test input's row 4: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Columns 5 (index 5) is '1', column 6 (index 6) is 8, then columns 7-9 are 1s, column 10 (index 10) is 8. So the 8s are at columns 6 and 10. The structure in the input's middle rows (like row 5) have 8s from column 3 to 12 (row 5: [0,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,0,0,0]). So columns 3-12 (indices 3 to 12) are 8s. The middle of this is (3+12)/2=7.5, so columns 7 and 8. So the vertical center is around column 8.\n\nSo in the output's top rows, maybe adding 8s at columns 7 and 8, or 6 and 10 (positions of the 8s in row 4). But the pattern from the training examples seems to add the inner number at positions that are symmetric around the center. For example, Ex0 added 2s at positions 4 and 7 (around column 6). Ex1 added 4s at 6 and 8 (around column 7). So maybe in the test case, the 8s would be added at positions 7 and 8 (middle columns) in the top and bottom rows.\n\nBut let's check the training examples again. Ex2 added 3s in column 11 of the top rows. The input's structure in Ex2 for the 3s starts at column 5 (row 5, columns 6-13 for 3s), so middle around 9.5. The added 3s are at column 11, which is towards the end. Maybe the positions depend on where the inner number first appears in the middle row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of added elements in the top and bottom rows corresponds to the number of times the inner number appears in the middle row. For example, in Ex0's middle row (row 6), there are 7 2s. The output adds two 2s in the top rows. Ex1's middle row has multiple 4s, and the output adds two 4s. Ex2's middle row has a lot of 3s, but the output adds one 3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: in all training examples, the output's top and bottom rows have the inner number inserted into the 0s, and the number of insertions increases with the example. Ex0: 2 instances of 2 in each top row. Ex1: 2 instances of 4 per row. Ex2: 1 instance of 3 per row. Wait, Ex2's output has three top rows with 3 at position 11 each. So maybe the positions are determined by the original input's unique occurrences of the inner number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inner number is added to the borders (top and bottom) at positions where the inner structure's columns start and end. For example, in Ex0's input, the 2s start at column 3 and end at column 9. So in the output, they add 2s at columns 4 and 7 (maybe one inside from start and end). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in the output, the inner number is placed in the top and bottom rows in positions that correspond to where the original inner structure had certain features. For example, in Ex0's input, the middle row (row 6) has a long stretch of 2s. The output's top rows have 2s at columns 4 and 7, which might be where the 2s in the middle row start and end. But row 6 in Ex0's input has 2s from column 3 to 10 (indices 3-10). So 4 is one after the start, and 7 is the middle. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the key is that the output transforms the input by:\n\n- Replacing certain cells in the inner structure with the surrounding number to create a cross or vertical/horizontal lines.\n- Adding the inner number to the top and bottom borders (original 0 rows) at specific positions, likely symmetrically.\n\nFor the test input, the inner number is 8, surrounded by 1s. The output should:\n\n- In the middle rows (the 8 regions), replace some 8s with 1s to form a vertical and/or horizontal line.\n- Add 8s to the top and bottom rows (which are 0s) at certain positions.\n\nLooking at Ex0's output, the middle row (row 6) has all 8s except the first and last elements which are 2. This creates a horizontal line of 8s with 2s at the ends. The vertical lines are added in the top and bottom. So perhaps in the test case, the middle row of the 8 structure will have 1s inserted in the middle to form a cross.\n\nFor example, the middle row of the 8s (row 9 in the test input) is [0,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,0,0,0]. In the output, maybe replace the central 8s with 1s. For instance, in row 9, replace the middle 8s with 1s to form a vertical line. Then, in the top and bottom 0 rows, add 8s in the columns that correspond to that vertical line.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Ex1's output, the middle rows have a vertical line of 1s in the 4s. For example, row 7 in Ex1's output is [4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4], which is a horizontal line of 1s flanked by 4s. So perhaps the cross is horizontal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace every other occurrence of the inner number in certain rows with the surrounding number, creating a striped pattern.\n\nBut this is getting a bit too vague. Let me try to look for a more concrete pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in all training examples, the number of rows in the input and output is the same. The transformation is not adding or removing rows, just modifying existing ones.\n\nLooking at Ex0's input and output:\n\nIn the input, row 2 is [0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0]. In the output, this row becomes the same. Rows 3 and 4 in the input have 8s and 2s, but in the output, row 3 is all 8s. So the 2 in row 3, column 7 of the input is replaced with 8 in the output. Similarly, row 4 in the input has a lot of 2s, which are replaced with 8s in a checkerboard pattern. For example, input row 4: [0,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,0] becomes [0,8,8,2,8,2,2,8,2,2,8,8,0]. So the 2s are kept in positions 3,5,6,8,9, and replaced with 8s elsewhere. Wait, no\u2014it's alternating. The row becomes 2,8,2,8, etc., but maybe every other 2 is replaced.\n\nHmm, perhaps the pattern is that in the inner structure's rows, every other occurrence of the inner number is replaced with the surrounding number. For example, in Ex0's row 4, the input has seven 2s. The output alternates 2 and 8. But how to determine the starting point. Let's see:\n\nInput row 4: [0,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,0]\nOutput row 4: [0,8,8,2,8,2,2,8,2,2,8,8,0]\n\nSo the first 2 is kept, next replaced with 8, then 2, 2, replaced with 8, etc. Wait, positions 3:2\u21922, 4:2\u21928, 5:2\u21922, 6:2\u21922, 7:2\u21928, 8:2\u21922, 9:2\u21922. So maybe it's not every other. Alternatively, the middle 2s are replaced. For example, in row 4, the 2s are replaced in positions 4,7, etc. Maybe there's a vertical line at the center where the inner number is kept, and others are replaced. But in Ex0's output row 4, the center is position 6 (0-based), which is 8. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace every even-positioned or odd-positioned occurrence of the inner number with the surrounding number. For example, in row 4 of Ex0's input, the 2s start at position 3. So positions 3 (0-based) is 2, 4:2, 5:2, etc. If we replace every other starting from position 3: 2\u21922, 4\u21928, 5\u21922, 6\u21928, etc. But that doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output leaves the first and last occurrence of the inner number in a row and replaces the rest. For example, in row 4 of Ex0, the first 2 is kept, then some are replaced. But in the output, the first 2 is kept, then 8, then 2, then 2, then 8, which doesn't fit that pattern.\n\nAnother approach: looking for symmetry. In Ex0's output row 4, the pattern is 2,8,2,2,8,2,2. So perhaps it's symmetrical around the center. The original row has seven 2s. The output keeps the first, third, fifth, seventh, etc. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace all inner numbers except those in certain columns. For example, in Ex0's output row 4, the 2s are kept in columns 3,5,6,8,9. Not sure. This approach is not leading me anywhere quickly.\n\nLet's think about the vertical lines. In Ex0's output, the middle row (row 6) is all 8s except the first and last elements, which are 2. This suggests a horizontal line. Then, looking at the vertical lines in the output, the columns that have 2s in the top and bottom rows (columns 4 and 7) might form vertical lines. So combining, the output forms a cross: a horizontal line in the middle row and vertical lines in columns 4 and 7. But how does this apply to other examples?\n\nIn Ex1's output, the middle row (row 7) is [4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4]. This is a horizontal line of 1s. The vertical lines added in the top rows are at columns 6 and 8. So the cross would be a horizontal line in the middle and vertical lines at 6 and 8. But in Ex1's output, the vertical lines in the top rows are at 6 and 8, which might align with the vertical lines of the cross.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n1. Find the inner number (the one surrounded by another number).\n2. In the middle row of the inner structure, replace all instances of the inner number with the surrounding number except for the edges (creating a horizontal line of the surrounding number).\n3. In the columns where the vertical lines of the cross are, replace the inner number with the surrounding number except at certain rows (creating vertical lines).\n4. Add the inner number to the top and bottom rows (originally 0s) at the columns corresponding to the vertical lines of the cross.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\n1. Inner number is 8, surrounded by 1s.\n2. Middle row of the 8 structure (assuming it's row 9, which is [0,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,0,0,0]) would be transformed into a horizontal line of 1s except the first and last 8s. So the output row would be [0,1,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,1,1,0,0,0]. But wait, the surrounding number is 1. So replacing the middle 8s with 1s. But how many? Maybe all except the first and last.\n\nAlternatively, the middle row in the output would have 8s at the start and end, and 1s in between. For example, row 9 in the test output would be [0,1,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,1,1,0,0,0].\n\n3. The vertical lines of the cross would be at columns where the original inner structure has certain features. Maybe columns 6 and 10 (where the 8s are in row 4 of the test input). So in the top rows, add 8s at columns 6 and 10.\n\nSo the test input's output would have in the top and bottom rows (which are all 0s) 8s at columns 6 and 10. Then, in the middle rows, replace 8s with 1s along vertical lines 6 and 10, creating a cross.\n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples?\n\nIn Ex0, the vertical lines are at columns 4 and 7. The middle row's horizontal line is all 8s except the ends. The vertical lines in the output's top rows are 4 and 7, which might be the columns where the inner number was present in the input's middle row.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Given time constraints, I'll proceed with the following steps:\n\nFor the test case:\n\n- The inner number is 8, surrounded by 1s.\n- The output will add 8s to the top and bottom rows (original 0s) at positions corresponding to the vertical lines of the cross.\n- The middle rows of the 8 structure will have 1s inserted to form a cross.\n\nLooking at Ex0's output, the vertical lines are added in columns 4 and 7. In the test case, the 8s are in columns 3-12 in rows 5-13. The middle column is (3+12)/2 = 7.5. So columns 7 and 8. Maybe the vertical lines are at these columns. So the top rows would have 8s at 7 and 8.\n\nBut looking at row 4 of the test input: the 8s are at columns 6 and 10. This might indicate that the vertical lines are at 6 and 10. So the output's top rows would have 8s at 6 and 10.\n\nIn Ex1's input, the 4s are added at columns 6 and 8 in the output. The middle of the 4 structure is around column 7, so 6 and 8 are around that. Similarly, for the test case, if the middle is 7.5, then columns 7 and 8 could be the vertical lines.\n\nBut how to decide? Given the training examples, the vertical lines in the output's top rows seem to be placed symmetrically around the center of the inner structure.\n\nAssuming that for the test case, the vertical lines are at columns 6 and 10 (where the 8s are in row 4), the top and bottom rows would have 8s at those positions. Then, in the middle rows of the 8 structure, replace the 8s at columns 6 and 10 with 1s to form vertical lines, and also replace the middle row's 8s (row 9) with 1s except the first and last.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nThe test output's top rows (rows 0-2 and 16-18) would have 8s at columns 6 and 10. For example:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nIn the middle rows (rows 5-13), the 8s would be replaced with 1s along columns 6 and 10, creating vertical lines. Also, the middle row (row 9) would have 1s except the first and last 8s.\n\nFor example, row 9 in the test input is [0,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,0,0,0]. The output might become [0,1,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,8,1,1,0,0,0], but this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical lines could be at columns 6 and 10, so replacing those with 1s in each row. For example, row 5 in the test input is [0,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,0,0,0]. The output row 5 would be [0,1,1,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,1,8,8,1,1,0,0,0], inserting 1s at columns 6 and 10.\n\nAdditionally, the middle row (row 9) would have a horizontal line of 1s, replacing the 8s in the middle.\n\nBut this is a lot of guesswork. Given the time, I'll proceed to write the output based on these assumptions.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to find the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by analyzing each example to understand the transformation.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nThe input has a structure with 0s surrounding 8s and some 2s in the middle. The output seems to replace certain 2s with 8s and introduces new 2s in the borders. Notably, the first few rows in the output have 2s placed at specific positions (like indices 4 and 7). Also, in the middle rows, some 2s are replaced by 8s, creating a sort of hollow or outline effect. The central row (row 6) in the input has a line of 2s that becomes mostly 8s in the output, except for the edges which are 2s again.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 1s and 4s. The output adds 4s in the top and bottom rows, again at specific columns. The middle rows where the 4s were originally present are transformed by replacing some 4s with 1s, creating a checkered pattern. The row with the most 4s in the input (row 7) becomes a row with 1s and a line of 4s in the output.\n\nExample 2 involves 2s and 3s. The output introduces 3s in the borders (like the first few rows and the last row) at column 11. The middle rows with 3s have certain 3s replaced with 2s, forming vertical lines. The central row (row 8) is transformed into a line of 2s except for the edges which are 3s.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern seems to involve two main steps:\n\n1. **Adding a border pattern:** In each example, the output introduces new numbers (like 2, 4, 3) in the outermost rows (top and bottom) at specific columns. These positions might correspond to the positions of the central element of the original structure. For instance, in Example 0, the 2s are added at columns 4 and 7, which might align with the center of the input's 8s structure.\n\n2. **Modifying the inner structure:** The original inner elements (like 2, 4, 3) are transformed by replacing certain instances with the surrounding number (like 8, 1, 2). This creates a pattern where the inner structure becomes a hollow version, with vertical or horizontal lines of the original number. The central row of the input's structure is transformed into a solid line of the surrounding number except for the edges.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\nThe test input has 1s and 8s. Following the observed pattern:\n\n- The borders (first few and last rows) should have 8s added at positions corresponding to the center columns of the original 8s structure. The original 8s are in the middle of the rows (positions around 6-11 in rows 5-13). The center might be at column 8 or 9. So the border rows (like the first three and last three) might have 8s inserted at those central positions.\n\n- The inner 8s should be modified. The central row (row 8 in the input) has all 8s. According to the pattern, this row might become all 1s except the edges, but looking at the examples, perhaps the central row becomes a line of 1s except for the edges, which stay as 8s. Wait, in Example 0, the central row (row 6) in the input was all 2s except edges, and the output turned it into 8s except the first and last elements as 2s. Hmm, maybe the central row's inner elements are replaced with the surrounding number (in this case, 1s), but the edges stay as 8s. Wait, the surrounding number here is 1. Wait, the input in the test has 1s surrounding 8s. So perhaps the inner 8s are replaced with 1s except along certain lines. Wait, maybe the vertical lines are preserved. For example, in the training examples, the vertical lines of the original number (like 2 in Example 0, 4 in Example 1, 3 in Example 2) were preserved in certain columns. So perhaps in the test input, the vertical columns that originally had 8s in the middle rows are kept as 8s, and the rest are replaced with 1s. But in Example 0, the 2s in the middle were replaced with 8s except for the edges. Similarly, in the test input, maybe the 8s in the middle rows are replaced with 1s except for vertical lines. Let's check:\n\nIn the test input, rows 5-13 have 8s. Let's look at row 5: [0, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. The output might replace some of the 8s with 1s. For example, the central column (maybe column 8 or 9) remains 8, and others become 1s. But how?\n\nLooking at the previous examples, the central row becomes a solid line of the surrounding number except the edges. For example, in Example 0, the central row (row 6 in input) had 2s and became 8s except edges. In the test input, the central row (row 8) is all 8s. Following the pattern, maybe this row becomes 1s except the first and last elements (which were 8s), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps vertical lines are preserved. For instance, in Example 0, the middle columns (like 4 and 7) had 2s added in the borders. So maybe in the test input, the vertical lines where the 8s are most prominent are preserved. Let's think about the structure:\n\nThe input's 8s form a block in the middle. The output might create vertical lines through this block. For example, in Example 0, the output created vertical lines of 2s by replacing certain 8s. In the test case, perhaps vertical lines of 8s are preserved, and the rest are replaced with 1s. But how to determine which columns? Looking at Example 0's input, the 2s were in the middle, and in the output, the vertical lines were at certain positions. Maybe the vertical lines correspond to the positions where the original number (in the input) was present in the central rows. For the test input, the 8s are in columns 3-12 in rows 5-13. The center columns might be around 7-8. So perhaps vertical columns 6 and 9 (for example) remain 8s, and others become 1s. Alternatively, the vertical lines are in the same positions as the original border additions.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the training examples, the number added in the borders (2,4,3) matches the inner number that's being modified. So in Example 0, the inner number was 2, and the borders added 2s. In Example 1, the inner number was 4, and borders added 4s. In Example 2, the inner number was 3, and borders added 3s. So for the test input, the inner number is 8, so the borders should have 8s added. Wait, but in the test input, the inner structure is 8, surrounded by 1s. However, looking at the training examples, the border added the same number as the inner one. But in Example 0, the inner was 2, and the borders added 2. In the test input, the inner is 8, so the borders should have 8s added. However, the output of Example 0 had 2s in the borders, which matched the inner number. So for the test input, the borders would get 8s in certain positions. But the test input's borders are 0s. Wait, but in the test input, the existing 0s would be replaced with 8s in certain positions. Wait, but the existing structure is 1s surrounding 8s. Let me check the training examples again.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input's main structure was 8s with 2s inside. The output added 2s in the borders (which were 0s). Similarly, in Example 1, the input had 1s surrounding 4s, and the output added 4s in the borders (0s). In Example 2, the input had 2s surrounding 3s, and the output added 3s in the borders. So the pattern is that the number that's inside the structure (the one being surrounded) is added to the borders. So in the test input, the inner number is 8, surrounded by 1s. Therefore, the output should have 8s added to the border rows (which are 0s) at specific positions.\n\nLooking at how the positions are determined: In Example 0, the 2s were added in the top and bottom rows at columns 4 and 7. Let's check the original input structure for Example 0. The 2s are in the middle rows. The columns where 2s were added in the borders might correspond to the horizontal center of the structure. The input's 8s span columns 1-11 in row 2. The center would be around column 6. But the 2s in the output's borders are at columns 4 and 7. Hmm, perhaps it's the positions of certain features. For example, in the input's row 4 of Example 0, there's a 2 in column 7. Maybe the positions where the inner number appears in certain rows determine the border positions.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 0, the 2s are added in the borders at columns 4 and 7. In the input, the first occurrence of 2 is in row 3, column 7. Then, in row 4, columns 3-9 are 2s. The center of that is column 6. Not sure. Maybe it's that the borders add the inner number at positions corresponding to the vertical lines of the inner structure. For example, in Example 0, the vertical lines of 2s in the middle rows are preserved, and those columns have 2s added to the borders. Similarly, in the test input, the vertical columns where 8s are present in the inner structure would have 8s added to the borders.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2s are in columns 3-9 in row 4. The output's borders have 2s at columns 4 and 7, which might be the left and right edges of the 2s in the inner structure. Similarly, in Example 1, the 4s are in columns 5-11 (row 6), and the output's borders have 4s added at columns 6 and 9. Wait, in Example 1's output, the borders have 4s at columns 6 and 9. The input's row 6 has 4s from column 5 to 11. The midpoints might be columns 8 and 9, but the output added 4s at 6 and 9. Not sure. Maybe it's the columns where the original number first appears in the structure. For instance, in Example 0, the 2 starts at column 3 in row 4. So columns 3 and 9 (start and end) of the 2s structure. But in the output, they added 2s at columns 4 and 7. Not matching exactly. Alternatively, the number of elements in the border rows: in Example 0, the border rows (output) have two 2s. Maybe it's two positions symmetrically placed around the center.\n\nAnother approach: in each example, the border rows (which were all 0s in the input) have the inner number inserted in specific columns. For example, in Example 0, the first output row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], so two 2s at columns 4 and 7. The original input's 2s were centered around column 7 (row 3 has 2 at column 7). Maybe the columns where the inner number first appears in the input's structure are used for the border additions.\n\nAlternatively, the output adds the inner number in the borders at positions that are mirrored around the center. For example, in Example 0's output, the 2s are at columns 4 and 7 in a 13-element row. The center is at index 6 (since 0-based, indices 0-12). 4 is 2 left of center, 7 is 1 right. Not exactly symmetrical. Hmm. Alternatively, the number of columns between the two added numbers is 3 (from 4 to 7). Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in each example, the number of rows added in the borders corresponds to the number of rows in the input. For instance, Example 0's input has 19 rows. The output's first four and last four rows have the added numbers. So maybe the number of border rows added depends on the structure's height.\n\nBut perhaps the main pattern is that the inner number (the one surrounded) is added to the borders (which were 0s) in specific columns, and the inner structure is transformed by creating vertical lines of the surrounding number (1 in the test case) and horizontal lines of the inner number (8). Wait, in Example 0, the surrounding number was 8, and the inner was 2. The output created vertical lines of 8s and added 2s in the borders. The inner 2s were replaced with 8s except along certain vertical lines.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that the inner structure's cells are replaced with the surrounding number (the outer number) except for certain vertical and horizontal lines that remain as the inner number. Then, the borders (0s) are replaced with the inner number at specific positions.\n\nIn the test input, the outer number is 1 and the inner is 8. So the inner 8s would be replaced with 1s except for vertical and/or horizontal lines that remain 8. Then, the borders (0s) would have 8s added at certain positions.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input: the inner 2s are replaced with 8s except for vertical lines. In the output, rows 4-13 (approx) have 2s in vertical lines. For example, row 4 in output is [0,8,8,2,8,2,2,8,2,2,8,8,0]. The 2s are at columns 3,5,6,8,9. Not sure. Alternatively, in the output of Example 0, the 2s form a vertical line in the middle (column 7), but in row 6 (central row), the entire row is 8s except edges. This is a bit confusing.\n\nAnother approach: looking for symmetry. In Example 0's output, the 2s are added symmetrically in the borders. Similarly, in Example 1, the 4s are added symmetrically. So for the test input, the 8s would be added symmetrically in the borders. For a row of 18 elements (test input's rows have 18 elements), the center is between columns 8 and 9 (0-based indices 8 and 9). So symmetric positions could be, for example, columns 6 and 11 (mirroring around the center).\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input's structure of 8s: in row 5, columns 3-12 are 8s. The center is columns 7.5 (so columns 7 and 8). Maybe the borders will have 8s added at columns 6 and 9, symmetrically around the center.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2s were added at columns 4 and 7. The input's structure for 2s starts at column 3 and ends at column 9 (row 4). The midpoint is column 6. So 4 and 7 are 2 left and 1 right of the midpoint. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the positions where the inner number first appears in the structure. For the test input, the first occurrence of 8 is in row 4, column 6 (assuming rows are 0-indexed). Then, the borders would add 8s at columns corresponding to that position.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed to hypothesize:\n\nFor each example, the output adds the inner number (the surrounded number) to the border rows (which were 0s) in specific columns. The columns are determined by the position where the inner number first appears in the input structure. For the test input, the first occurrence of 8 is in row 4, column 6. So the border rows would have 8s at column 6 and perhaps symmetric columns.\n\nAlternatively, the number of added elements in the borders corresponds to the vertical position of the inner structure. For example, in Example 0, the first two rows of the output have 2s at columns 4 and 7. Maybe these are the columns where the inner structure starts and ends. For the test input's inner structure (8s) in row 4, columns 6 and 10 (assuming the 8s start at 6 and end at 10?), but looking at row 4 of the test input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. So the 8s are at columns 6 and 10 (indices 6 and 10 if 0-based). Maybe the borders would add 8s at these columns.\n\nSo the border rows (first three and last three) would have 8s at columns 6 and 10. Then, in the inner structure (rows 4-13), the 8s would be replaced with 1s except for vertical lines at columns 6 and 10. Additionally, the central row (row 8) might become all 1s except for the edges being 8s.\n\nLet me check the test input's row 8: [0, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. The output would replace all 8s with 1s except columns 6 and 10. So row 8 would become [0,1,1,1,1,1,8,1,1,1,8,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]. Wait, but in Example 0, the central row became all 8s except edges. Maybe in the test input's central row, all 8s are replaced with 1s except the edges (columns 3 and 12?), but the input's row 8 has 8s from column 3 to 12. So the output's row 8 would have 1s except columns 3 and 12, which are 8s. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical lines are preserved where the inner number is present in certain rows. For example, in rows where the inner number is present in the middle, the vertical lines are kept. This is getting complicated.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the best approach is to apply the following steps based on the examples:\n\n1. In the border rows (originally all 0s), add the inner number (8) at specific columns. For the test input, let's assume columns 6 and 10 (based on Example 0's pattern where the inner number's columns are mirrored).\n\n2. In the inner structure (rows with 1s and 8s), replace the 8s with 1s except for vertical columns that correspond to the positions where the 8s were first added in the borders. So if the borders have 8s at columns 6 and 10, then in the inner rows, those columns remain 8s, and others become 1s.\n\n3. Additionally, the central row (row 8) might become all 1s except for the edges, but in the test input, row 8 has all 8s. If following Example 0's pattern, the central row would become 1s except for the first and last 8s. But in Example 0's output, the central row is all 8s except for the first and last elements which are 2s. So perhaps in the test input's central row (row 8), the entire row becomes 1s except columns 3 and 12 (the edges of the 8s structure) which remain 8s.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\n- The border rows (first three and last three) will have 8s added at columns 6 and 10 (0-based indices 6 and 10). So the rows would look like [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\n- For the inner rows (rows 3-14), the 8s are replaced with 1s except in columns 6 and 10. For example, row 5 in the input is [0,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,0,0,0]. The output would become [0,1,1,1,1,1,8,1,1,1,8,1,1,1,1,0,0,0].\n\n- The central row (row 8) might have all 1s except columns 6 and 10, but based on Example 0, perhaps this row is entirely 1s except for the first and last 8s. But row 8 in the input is all 8s from column 3 to 12. Following Example 0's central row, which turned into all 8s except edges, perhaps in the test input's central row, it becomes all 1s except columns 3 and 12, which are 8s. So row 8 would be [0,1,1,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,1,1,0,0,0]. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the central row could be transformed into a line of the outer number (1) except for columns where the borders have the inner number (8). For example, if columns 6 and 10 have 8s in the borders, then the central row's columns 6 and 10 remain 8s. So row 8 becomes [0,1,1,1,1,1,8,1,1,1,8,1,1,1,1,0,0,0].\n\nBut looking at Example 0, the central row (row 6 in input) had all 2s and became all 8s except the first and last elements (which were 2s). So perhaps in the test input's central row, all 8s become 1s except the first and last 8s in that row. So in row 8, the first 8 is at column 3, and the last at column 12. So the output would have 8s there and 1s elsewhere. Thus, row 8 becomes [0,1,1,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,1,1,0,0,0].\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this hypothesis.",
