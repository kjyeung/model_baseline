        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of lists (like a grid), and the output is another list of lists. The key is to find how the input grids are transformed into the output grids.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a lot of 1s, some 2s, 3s, and 8s. The output is a smaller grid. Maybe the output is a specific region from the input, or perhaps some kind of downsampling. Let me check the dimensions. The input has 17 elements per row, and the output has 5. So maybe it's taking the center part? For instance, maybe each output row is the middle elements of the corresponding input row. Let me count: 17 elements, so the middle 5 would be positions 7 to 11 (0-based index). Wait, 17 elements, middle would be the 9th element as the center. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's looking for specific patterns in the input that form a smaller shape.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, the output rows are [2,2,2,2,2], [2,1,2,1,2], etc. Looking at the input rows, maybe the output is capturing a diamond or cross shape. For example, in the input rows 3 to 7 (0-based), there are 2s forming a diamond perhaps. Wait, the input rows 3 to 7 (indices 3 to 7) might have a 2 pattern. Let me check the input rows:\n\nRow 3: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1]\nRow 4: [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1]\nRow 5: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1]\nRow 6 is same as row 4, and row 7 is similar to row3 but with 2s turning into 1s again.\n\nThe output of Example 0 is 5 rows. Let's see if those rows correspond to the middle rows of the input. The input has 17 rows (since each example's input is a list of lists, each list being a row). Wait, the first example's input has 18 elements per row, but output is 5 rows. Wait, the training examples have varying input lengths. For example 0, the input has 17 rows, each of length 17. The output has 5 rows, each of length 5. So maybe the output is a 5x5 grid taken from the center of the 17x17 input. Let's check. For example 0's input rows, taking the middle 5 elements from the middle 5 rows. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the input rows in Example 0. The input has 17 rows. The middle rows would be around row 8 (0-based index 8). The output has 5 rows. So perhaps rows 6 to 10 (inclusive)? Let me check. Row 8 of the input is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], which in the output is not present. Wait, the output for Example 0 starts with [2,2,2,2,2], which might correspond to row 3 in the input. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the output is formed by specific patterns. For example, in Example 0's input, the 2s form a diamond shape, and the output is that diamond. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the input rows where 2s are present. Rows 3 to 7 (indices 3-7). For row 3, the 2s are from positions 3 to 7 (indices 3-7). So 2,2,2,2,2. That's five 2s. The output's first row is [2,2,2,2,2], which matches. The next row in output is [2,1,2,1,2]. Looking at row 4 of input: [1,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,1, ...]. So positions 3-7 (indices 3 to 7) are 2,1,2,1,2. Which matches the output's second row. Similarly, row 5 of input has 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1... So positions 3-7 are 1,1,1,1,1? Wait no, row 5's elements 3-7 would be 1 (since the row is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1...]). Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me list the elements of row 5: positions 0 to 16. The elements are [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,1]. So from index 3 to 7: positions 3 is 1, 4 is 1, 5 is 1, 6 is 1, 7 is 2. So the middle five would be [1,1,1,1,2], which is the third row of the output: [1,1,1,1,2]. That matches. Then row 6 is same as row4, so the output's fourth row would be [2,1,2,1,2], which matches. Row7's middle five elements: from index3-7: 2,2,2,2,2 (since row7 is [1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1, ...]). So the fifth row of output is [2,2,2,2,2]. So that fits. So the output is taking the middle five rows (rows3-7) and the middle five elements (columns3-7) of each of those rows. So the pattern is that for the input grid, the output is a 5x5 grid taken from the center of the input. Wait, but in Example0, the input is 17x17, so the center would be row8 (0-based) as the middle row. But the output is 5 rows, so maybe rows 6-10? No, in Example0 the output is rows3-7. Because the output rows correspond to input rows3-7. So perhaps the pattern is that the output is a 5x5 grid extracted from the middle of the input grid. But how exactly? Let me check other examples.\n\nTake Example1. The input is 18 rows each of 18 elements. The output is 5 rows of 3 elements each. Wait, Example1's output is 5 rows, each with 3 elements. So that's 5x3. But in Example0, it's 5x5. Hmm, maybe the output size depends on the input. Alternatively, maybe the output is capturing a certain shape, like a cross or a diamond. Let's check Example1's output. The output is:\n\n[8,4,8]\n[4,4,4]\n[8,4,8]\n[4,4,4]\n[8,4,8]\n\nLooking at the input, perhaps there's a diamond shape with 3,4, and 6. The input has 3s in certain positions. For example, row5 of input (0-based) is [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,8,...], which is a horizontal line of 3s. Then in row9, there's 4s. Then 6s in rows10-17. But the output is 5 rows, each 3 elements. So maybe taking the center columns and certain rows. Let's see the input rows that correspond to the output. The output has 5 rows. Let's look at input rows that have 4s. Rows9,10,11, etc. For example, row9: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8]. So the middle columns (since the input has 18 elements, the center would be around positions 8-9). Maybe taking columns 8-10 (three elements) from certain rows. If the output is 5x3, perhaps taking rows where the 4s and 8s form a pattern. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-background elements. The background in Example0 is 1, and the shapes are 2,3,8. The output captures the central part of those shapes. So in Example1, the background is 8, and the other numbers (3,4,6) form shapes. The output seems to be capturing the 4s and 8s in a cross-like pattern. For instance, the output rows alternate between 8,4,8 and 4,4,4. That looks like a vertical line of 4s with 8s on the sides. So maybe the output is the central vertical slice of the shape. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for the position of the non-background numbers in the input and how they form the output. For Example3's input, the output is 3 rows of 5 elements. The output rows are [1,3,3,3,1], [3,3,1,3,3], [1,3,3,3,1]. These look like a diamond or a plus sign. In the input, the 3s form a diamond shape in the lower part of the grid. So the output is capturing that diamond.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern seems to be that the output is a cropped section of the input that contains a specific shape, likely centered and of a certain size. For example, in each case, the output is a small grid that captures a symmetrical shape (like a cross, diamond, etc.) formed by numbers other than the background (which is the majority number in the input). The size of the output varies, but in the training examples, it's 5x5, 5x3, 3x3, etc. However, the outputs in the training examples have varying sizes. Example0's output is 5x5, Example1 is 5x3, Example2 is 5x3, Example3 is 3x5. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a specific transformation applied to the input, such as detecting the central cross or diamond in each cluster of non-background numbers. For example, in each input, the largest contiguous non-background shape is isolated, and the output is the minimal bounding box around it, or some transformation like taking every other element or applying a convolution.\n\nLooking at Example2's input. The output is [8,8,8], [8,2,2], etc. The input has regions of 8s and 3s. The output might be capturing a pattern where 8s form a certain shape. For instance, in the input, there's a part where 8s form a sort of 'H' shape or other structure, and the output is a smaller version.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking for regions where the numbers form a certain pattern, like a cross, and then outputting that cross. For example, in Example0's input, the 2s form a cross, and the output is that cross. Similarly, Example1's 4s form a cross.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output is the central 3x3 or 5x5 of the largest non-background cluster. But in Example0, the output is 5x5, which might be the entire cluster of 2s and 3s. However, the 3s are in the right part of the input. So maybe the output is combining multiple shapes. Alternatively, the output is each distinct shape in the input, but the training examples only have one output. Wait, all training examples have one output, which is multiple rows, not multiple grids.\n\nAnother approach: look at the Test Input. The input has a lot of 3s, some 1s, 6s, and 8s. The output needs to be determined. Let's see the Test Input structure.\n\nThe Test Input starts with 18 rows, each 18 elements. The first two rows are all 3s. Then rows 2-4 (0-based) have 1s in certain positions. Then rows 5-8 have 6s. Then rows 12-17 have 8s forming a square or cross. Let's see:\n\nRows 2-4 (indices 2,3,4):\n\nRow2: ...1,3,1,1,3...\nRow3: ...1,1,3,1,3...\nRow4: ...1,3,1,1,3...\n\nThese might form a pattern. Then rows5-8 (indices5-8) have 6s. For example, row5 has a 6 at position3, row6 has 6,6,6 at positions2-4, row7 has 6 at position3, row8 has 6,6,6 at positions2-4 again. So this forms a vertical line of 6s in the middle. Then rows12-17 (indices12-17) have 8s. For example, rows12 and13 have two 8s at positions8-9. Rows14 and15 have six 8s (positions6-11). Rows16 and17 have two 8s again. So this forms a larger cross or diamond of 8s.\n\nNow, the output needs to capture the main shapes. Looking at the training examples, each output seems to capture the largest or most prominent non-background shape. For example, in Example0, the 2s and 3s form shapes, but the output is the 2s' cross. In Example1, the 4s form a cross. In Example3, the 3s form a diamond.\n\nIn the Test Input, the prominent shapes are the 6s in rows5-8 and the 8s in rows12-17. But which one is considered the main shape? The 6s form a vertical line (maybe a cross?), and the 8s form a horizontal bar and vertical bar. Alternatively, the 8s form a larger cross. Let's visualize:\n\nThe 8s in rows14-15 are six elements in a row, spanning columns6-11. Then in rows12-13 and16-17, they have two 8s each. So this could form a cross where the horizontal part is in rows14-15 (columns6-11) and the vertical part is in columns8-9 across rows12-17. So combining them, it's a plus sign. The 6s form a vertical line in rows5-8, columns2-4 (but centered at column3). \n\nBut according to the training examples, the output is the central part of the shape. For example, in Example0, the output is the central cross of 2s. Similarly, for the Test Input, the output might be the cross formed by the 8s. Let's see the rows where 8s appear. Rows12-17. The central rows would be around rows14-15. The columns for the horizontal part are 6-11, and the vertical part is columns8-9. So the cross's center is at row14, column8-9. The horizontal part is six elements (columns6-11) and vertical is six rows (12-17). So the minimal bounding box would be rows12-17, columns6-11. But the output needs to be a smaller grid. Alternatively, the output is the central part of the cross. The cross's horizontal arm is rows14-15, columns6-11. The vertical arm is rows12-17, columns8-9. The intersection is at row14, columns8-9. So the cross would have a horizontal line of 8s in rows14-15, columns6-11, and vertical line rows12-17, columns8-9. The output would be a 6-row by 6-column grid, but the training examples have smaller outputs. However, the Test Input's output might be the central 3x3 or 5x5 of this cross. Alternatively, the output could be the vertical and horizontal lines compressed.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the Test Input's 8s:\n\nRows12-13: columns8-9 are 8s.\n\nRows14-15: columns6-11 are 8s.\n\nRows16-17: columns8-9 are 8s.\n\nThis forms a cross where the horizontal line is two rows (14-15) long, and the vertical line is six rows (12-17) long. The center of the cross is at row14, column8-9. To represent this as a cross in the output, perhaps the output is a vertical line of 8s, but since the training examples for cross-like structures (like Example1) have outputs like [8,4,8], etc., which are vertical lines with a center. So perhaps the Test Input's output would be a vertical line of 8s in the middle, with the horizontal parts. For example:\n\n[8, 8]\n[8, 8]\n[8, 8]\n[8, 8]\n[8, 8]\n[8, 8]\n\nBut the training examples have varying row lengths. Alternatively, maybe the output is the vertical slice through the cross. For example, columns8-9 across all rows. But rows12-17 have 8s in columns8-9. That would be 6 rows of 2 elements each. But the training examples have outputs like 5 rows of 3 elements (Example1). So maybe the output is taking the central part. For the vertical line of 8s in columns8-9 from rows12-17, maybe the output is a 6x2 grid, but the training examples have outputs with more elements. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is a central cross or diamond formed by the non-background numbers. For the Test Input's 8s, the cross is wider in the horizontal direction. So the output would be the central part of this cross. Let's say the cross's horizontal arm is two rows (14-15) with six 8s, and the vertical arm is six rows (12-17) with two 8s. The intersection is at rows14-15, columns8-9. The minimal bounding box would be rows12-17 and columns6-11, but that's 6 rows by 6 columns. However, the output examples are smaller. Maybe the output is the intersection point and a few around. For example, taking rows14-15 and columns8-9, but that's only two rows. Or maybe taking the center 3x3. But rows14-15 and columns6-11: the center columns would be 8-9. So a 3x3 grid around row14, column8-9. That would be rows13-15 and columns7-9. Let's check the Test Input:\n\nRow13: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nSo columns8-9 are 8,8. Row14: [3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3]. Columns6-11 are 8s. So columns6-11: positions6-11 are 8,8,8,8,8,8. So in row14, columns6-11 are all 8s.\n\nSimilarly, row15 is the same. So if the output is the cross's central part, maybe it's a vertical line of 8s with a horizontal line through the middle. For example, the output could be:\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nBut that's two rows. Not matching the training examples' structure.\n\nAlternatively, considering the 6s in the Test Input. Rows5-8 (indices5-8) have 6s. For example:\n\nRow5: [3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow6: [3,3,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow7: [3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow8: [3,3,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nThese form a vertical line of 6s in columns2-4 (row6 and row8 have three 6s in columns2-4). Rows5 and7 have a single 6 in column3. So the shape is a vertical line of 6s in column3, with some horizontal elements. For example, row6 has 6,6,6 in columns2-4. So it's a vertical line with a horizontal bar in the middle. That forms a cross. So the output for the 6s could be a cross shape. The center of this cross would be row6, column3. Taking the central 3x3 around that, rows5-7, columns2-4:\n\nRow5: column3 is 6.\nRow6: columns2-4 are 6,6,6.\nRow7: column3 is6.\nRow8: columns2-4 are6,6,6 again.\n\nBut how does this form a cross? The central rows for this cross would be rows5-8. But the output needs to be a small grid. If we take the central 3x3 of this cross, it would look like:\n\nRow6: [6,6,6]\nRow7: [3,6,3]\nRow8: [6,6,6]\n\nWait, but row7's columns2-4 are 3,6,3? No, row7 is [3,3,3,6,3,3,...]. So columns2-4 are 3,6,3. Then row8 is [3,3,6,6,6,3...]. So columns2-4 are 6,6,6. So the 3x3 would be:\n\nRow6: 6,6,6\nRow7:3,6,3\nRow8:6,6,6\n\nBut that's not a symmetric cross. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the output is the vertical line of 6s. For example, the output could be:\n\n[6]\n[6]\n[6]\n[6]\n\nBut training examples have more elements. \n\nAlternatively, considering the Test Input's two main shapes: the 6s and the 8s. Which one is the primary shape? The 8s are in more rows and columns, possibly larger. The output examples in the training seem to pick the most prominent shape. For example, in Example0, the 2s and 3s are present, but the output is the 2s' cross. So perhaps the Test Input's output is the 8s cross.\n\nLooking back at the 8s in the Test Input:\n\nRows12-13: columns8-9 are 8s.\nRows14-15: columns6-11 are 8s (six 8s in each row).\nRows16-17: columns8-9 are 8s.\n\nThis forms a cross where the horizontal arm is two rows (14-15) with six 8s each, and the vertical arm is six rows (12-17) with two 8s each. The center is at row14, columns8-9. The minimal bounding box for this cross would be rows12-17 and columns6-11. That's 6 rows by 6 columns. However, the training examples have smaller outputs. Maybe the output is taking the central part of this cross. For example, rows13-15 and columns7-10. Let's see:\n\nRow13: columns6-11: 3,3,8,8,3,3.\nRow14: columns6-11:8,8,8,8,8,8.\nRow15: columns6-11:8,8,8,8,8,8.\nRow16: columns6-11:3,3,8,8,3,3.\n\nWait, rows12-17:\n\nRow12: columns8-9:8,8.\nRow13: columns8-9:8,8.\nRow14: columns6-11:8,8,8,8,8,8.\nRow15: same as row14.\nRow16: columns8-9:8,8.\nRow17: same as row16.\n\nSo the cross has a horizontal bar in rows14-15, columns6-11, and vertical bar in columns8-9, rows12-17. The intersection is rows14-15, columns8-9.\n\nIf we take the central 3x3 around this intersection, rows13-15 and columns7-9:\n\nRow13: columns7-9:3,8,8.\nRow14: columns7-9:8,8,8.\nRow15: same as row14.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[3,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nBut this includes a 3, which is part of the background. Alternatively, the output might be the vertical and horizontal bars. For the vertical bar (columns8-9, rows12-17), it's six rows of two 8s. For the horizontal bar (rows14-15, columns6-11), it's two rows of six 8s. The output could be combining these into a cross. For example:\n\nThe vertical bar would be six rows of [8,8]. The horizontal bar would be two rows of [8,8,8,8,8,8]. To form a cross, perhaps the output is a combination. But the training examples for cross shapes (Example1) have outputs like [8,4,8], [4,4,4], [8,4,8], etc. That's a vertical line with a horizontal line in the center.\n\nApplying that to the Test Input's 8s cross, the output could be:\n\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n\nBut the training examples have varying row lengths, so maybe not. Alternatively, focusing on the intersection part. If the output is a 5x5 grid around the center (row14, column8), but the cross's horizontal arm is two rows, then it's not centered. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the output examples have the same number of rows as the vertical length of the cross and the same number of columns as the horizontal length. For the vertical arm, six rows, and horizontal arm six columns. The output would then be 6x6, but the training examples have smaller outputs. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the central part of each shape. For the 8s cross, the central part is where the horizontal and vertical arms intersect. That would be rows14-15 and columns8-9. So the output could be:\n\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n\nBut that's only two rows, which doesn't match training examples. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the vertical arm. In Example1's output, the vertical arm is three elements. For the Test Input's vertical arm of 6 rows, maybe the output is the central three rows:\n\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n\nBut how to align with the training examples?\n\nAlternatively, the pattern might be that the output is the minimal bounding box of the largest non-background shape. For the Test Input's 8s, the bounding box is rows12-17 (6 rows) and columns6-11 (6 columns). But this is 6x6, which is larger than any training example output. However, the training examples have outputs like 5x5 (Example0), 5x3 (Example1), 5x3 (Example2), 3x5 (Example3). So maybe the output is the central part of the bounding box. For example, taking the central 5 rows and 5 columns. So from rows12-17, the middle 5 rows would be rows13-17 (assuming even split). Columns6-11, the middle 5 columns would be7-11. But this is getting too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for another pattern. In all training examples, the output is a smaller grid where each row corresponds to a row in the input, but with certain elements selected. For example, in Example0, each output row is the middle 5 elements of certain input rows. But this doesn't hold for other examples. \n\nAnother possible pattern is that the output is a specific transformation of the input grid, like a kernel convolution or edge detection. But I don't see how that applies to the training examples.\n\nWait, looking at Example3's input, the output is three rows of five elements. The input's lower part has 2s and 3s forming a diamond. The output is three rows: the middle row is [3,3,1,3,3], which could be the center of the diamond, and the other rows are [1,3,3,3,1]. This suggests that the output is the diamond shape, which is a 3x5 grid. So the pattern might be that the output is the minimal grid that contains the entire shape, but cropped to exclude background. So for Example0, the shape is 5x5, so the output is that. For Example1, the shape is 5x3, etc.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input, the largest non-background shape is the 8s cross. The minimal grid that contains the entire cross would be rows12-17 (6 rows) and columns6-11 (6 columns). But this is 6x6, which is larger than any training example. However, the training examples' outputs are smaller. So maybe the output is the central part of this cross. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the vertical part of the cross. For example, columns8-9 (vertical arm) across rows12-17. This would give six rows of two 8s each. But the training examples have outputs with varying row lengths, so maybe the output is:\n\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n\nBut the training examples' outputs have 3 or 5 rows. However, the Test Input's output may vary. But the problem states to respond in the format of the training examples, which have outputs with varying row lengths. For example, Example1's output has 5 rows of 3 elements each. So perhaps the Test Input's output is similarly a 5x3 grid. Looking at the 8s cross, perhaps taking rows13-17 and columns7-9. Let's see:\n\nRow13: columns7-9:8,8,3 (since row13 is [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,3,3,...]).\nRow14: columns7-9:8,8,8.\nRow15: same as row14.\nRow16: columns7-9:3,8,8.\nRow17: same as row16.\n\nSo the 5x3 grid would be:\n\n[8,8,3]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n[3,8,8]\n[3,8,8]\n\nBut this includes 3s which are background. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output is the horizontal part of the cross (rows14-15, columns6-11), which is six elements per row. Taking the central three elements (columns7-9) gives:\n\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nBut that's two rows. Not matching training examples.\n\nAlternatively, considering the 6s in the Test Input. The 6s form a vertical line in column3 across rows5-8. The shape is a vertical line with a horizontal line in row6 and 8 (columns2-4). This forms a cross. The minimal grid around this cross would be rows5-8 and columns2-4. That's 4 rows by 3 columns. The center is row6 and 7, column3. The grid would be:\n\nRow5: column3 is6, columns2-4 are3,6,3.\nRow6: columns2-4 are6,6,6.\nRow7: column3 is6, columns2-4 are3,6,3.\nRow8: columns2-4 are6,6,6.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[3,6,3]\n[6,6,6]\n[3,6,3]\n[6,6,6]\n\nBut this includes 3s. The training examples' outputs don't include background numbers. For example, Example0's output only has 2s and 1s (background is 1, and 2s are the shape). So perhaps the output includes only the non-background numbers. In this case, the 6s. So the output would be:\n\n[6]\n[6,6,6]\n[6]\n[6,6,6]\n\nBut that's inconsistent. Maybe the output is the central cross:\n\n[6,6,6]\n[6,6,6]\n\nBut that's two rows. Not matching training examples.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the pattern is that the output is the central 5 rows of the input's non-background shapes, taking the middle elements. For the Test Input, the main shape is the 8s cross. The central 5 rows of the cross would be rows13-17 (assuming the cross spans rows12-17). But rows13-17 are five rows. For columns, the cross spans columns6-11. Taking the middle five columns (columns7-11) would give 5 elements per row. But rows13 and 16-17 have only two 8s in columns8-9, so their middle five columns would include 3s. For example:\n\nRow13: columns7-11 are8,8,3,3,3.\nRow14: columns7-11 are8,8,8,8,8.\nRow15: same as row14.\nRow16: columns7-11 are3,3,8,8,3.\nRow17: same as row16.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[8,8,3,3,3]\n[8,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,8]\n[3,3,8,8,3]\n[3,3,8,8,3]\n\nBut this includes 3s, which are background. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the vertical arm of the cross, columns8-9, rows12-17. That's six rows of two 8s. But how to format this? Example1's output is five rows of three elements, so maybe taking the middle five rows of the vertical arm. Rows12-17 are six rows; the middle five would be rows12-16 (indices12-16). Columns8-9:\n\nRow12:8,8\nRow13:8,8\nRow14:8,8 (from the horizontal arm)\nRow15:8,8 (same as row14)\nRow16:8,8\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n\nBut each row has two elements, which matches Example1's output structure (rows with three elements but not here). This doesn't align with training examples' format. \n\nAt this point, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the central cross of the largest non-background shape, taking the central 5 rows and 5 columns (or similar). For the Test Input's 8s cross, the central part would be rows13-15 and columns6-11. Rows13-15 are three rows. Columns6-11 are six columns. So the middle three columns would be8-9. So the output is three rows of three elements each, but the Test Input's output needs to be formatted like the training examples. \n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the central part of the horizontal and vertical arms. For example, the horizontal arm is rows14-15, columns6-11. The vertical arm is rows12-17, columns8-9. The output could be the intersection plus a few rows/columns. For example, rows14-15, columns8-9 (the center of the cross) would be:\n\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n\nBut that's two rows. Not matching training examples.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another pattern. All training examples have outputs that are symmetrical. For example, Example0's output is a cross that's symmetrical. Example1's output is a vertical line with a horizontal line in the middle. The Test Input's 8s cross is symmetrical. So the output should also be symmetrical. \n\nLooking at the Test Input's 8s cross again:\n\nRows12-13 and 16-17: columns8-9 are 8s.\nRows14-15: columns6-11 are 8s.\n\nThis is a symmetrical cross. The minimal output capturing this would be the vertical and horizontal arms. If the output is the vertical arm (columns8-9) across all rows where there are 8s, which is six rows, but the training examples have outputs with 3 or 5 rows. Alternatively, the output is the horizontal arm (rows14-15) plus the vertical arm (columns8-9) in a few rows. For example, taking rows13-15 and columns7-9:\n\nRow13: columns7-9:8,8,3\nRow14: columns7-9:8,8,8\nRow15: columns7-9:8,8,8\n\nThis gives:\n\n[8,8,3]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, the output is the horizontal arm (rows14-15) and the vertical arm (columns8-9) in those rows. So rows14-15, columns6-11 would be two rows of six 8s. But the output examples have varying row lengths. Example0's output has five elements per row. Example1 has three. Maybe for the Test Input's horizontal arm, the output is the middle three elements of each row in the horizontal arm. For example, rows14-15, columns7-9 (three elements each):\n\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nBut that's two rows. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, combining both the vertical and horizontal arms into a cross-shaped output. For example:\n\nThe central row is the horizontal arm's row (14-15), and the central column is the vertical arm (8-9). So the output could be:\n\nFor row14: columns6-11 (six 8s) but taking the central three columns (8-9-10). But columns6-11 are all 8s in rows14-15. So taking three columns would give three 8s. Then for the vertical arm, taking rows12-17, columns8-9, which are six pairs of 8s. But combining these into a cross would require a 5-row output where the middle row is three 8s and the others are two 8s. For example:\n\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n\nBut this isn't a standard grid. The training examples have rectangular grids. For example, Example1's output is 5x3. So perhaps the Test Input's output is a 5x3 grid. Let's try taking rows13-17 of the vertical arm (columns8-9), but that's five rows. Each row has two 8s. So output would be:\n\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n\nBut each row has two elements. However, Example1's output has three elements per row. This doesn't match. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to make a guess, I'll assume that the output is the central cross of the largest non-background shape. For the Test Input, the largest shape is the 8s cross. The output is the vertical and horizontal arms combined. So perhaps the output is:\n\n[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n\nBut this is six elements per row. Alternatively, the output is the central part of the cross, which would be three rows of six elements each (rows14-15, columns6-11):\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nBut two rows. \n\nAlternatively, the output is the vertical arm (columns8-9) of the cross, but taking the middle five rows. The vertical arm has six rows (12-17), so the middle five would be rows13-17. Each row has two 8s. So output:\n\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n\nBut each row has two elements. However, the training examples have varying row lengths. Example3's output has 5 elements per row. But without a clear pattern, I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll make an educated guess. The Test Input's output is likely capturing the 8s cross, and the output is structured similarly to Example1's output. Example1's output is:\n\n[8,4,8]\n[4,4,4]\n[8,4,8]\n[4,4,4]\n[8,4,8]\n\nWhich is a vertical line of 8s with horizontal lines of 4s. Similarly, the Test Input's output could be a vertical line of 8s with a horizontal line. The horizontal part is in rows14-15, columns6-11. Taking the central three columns (8-9-10) of these rows gives three 8s. The vertical part is columns8-9 in rows12-17. Taking the middle five rows (13-17) gives five rows of two 8s. But combining these into a cross, the output would be:\n\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nBut this is not a rectangular grid. Alternatively, the output is a 5x3 grid where the middle row is three 8s and the others are 8s on the ends. Like:\n\n[8, 8, 8]\n[8, 8, 8]\n[8, 8, 8]\n[8, 8, 8]\n[8, 8, 8]\n\nBut this is just five rows of three 8s. But where's the cross shape? Alternatively, maybe the output is the horizontal part (rows14-15) and the vertical part (columns8-9) in those rows. So rows14-15 have 8s in all columns6-11, but the vertical arm is columns8-9. So in rows14-15, columns8-9 are part of both arms. So the output for these rows could be:\n\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nBut again, not matching the training examples.\n\nFinally, considering that the Test Input's 8s form a larger cross, and the output examples for crosses in the training data (Example0 and Example1) have outputs with alternating rows, perhaps the Test Input's output is similar to Example1's. Example1's output alternates between rows with the background and the shape. So the Test Input's output might be:\n\n[3,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8,3]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, given the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to go with the answer that the output is the central 5 rows and 5 columns of the Test Input's 8s cross. But looking at the Test Input's structure, the 8s are in rows12-17 and columns6-11. The central 5 rows would be rows13-17 (five rows) and columns7-10 (four columns). But this doesn't form a 5x5 grid. \n\nGiven all this, I'll hazard a guess that the output is a vertical line of 8s. So the output would be five rows of two 8s each, taken from the vertical arm:\n\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n\nBut since the training examples have varying row lengths and this isn't matching, perhaps the correct answer is:\n\n[8, 8]\n[8, 8]\n[8, 8]\n[8, 8]\n[8, 8]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the output could be the horizontal part of the cross, which is two rows of six 8s. Taking the middle three elements:\n\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nBut again, this doesn't fit the training examples' format. \n\nAnother possibility is that the output is the central part of the cross, which for the horizontal arm is two rows (14-15) of six 8s, and for the vertical arm, the middle three rows (14-16) of two 8s. Combining them into a cross would give:\n\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n\nBut this is not a rectangular grid. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll go with the following answer based on the Test Input's 8s forming a cross similar to Example1's 4s. The output is:\n\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nBut this is just five rows of three 8s. However, considering the actual Test Input structure, the central part of the horizontal arm is six 8s, so the middle three would be columns7-9. So rows14-15, columns7-9 are three 8s each. So the output would be five rows, with the middle three rows being [8,8,8], and the others being [8,8] from the vertical arm. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, based on Example1's output which is 5 rows of 3 elements, perhaps the Test Input's output is:\n\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,8,8]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I'll submit the answer that seems most plausible based on the training examples, even if I'm not fully certain.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by analyzing the examples to understand the transformation from input to output.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nThe input has multiple rows, and the output is a smaller matrix. The output is 5 rows. Let me see if there's a pattern in how the input rows are transformed.\n\nIn Example 0's input, rows 0-16 are given, but the output is 5 rows. Maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input and processing them. Let's check the content.\n\nLooking at the input rows for Example 0, the first few rows are mostly 1s. Then there are rows with 2s and 3s. The output has rows like [2,2,2,2,2], which might be the middle row of some structure. Wait, perhaps the output is capturing a central region, maybe a cross or diamond shape.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is formed by extracting certain columns and rows where there's a change in numbers. For instance, looking for areas where the numbers form a diamond or a cross. Let's check if the output rows correspond to parts of the input that form a cross.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first row is all 2s. Looking at the input, the rows that have 2s are rows 3,4,5,6,7. For instance, row 3 has [1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1,...]. The output rows might be the central part of those 2s. Wait, the output rows have 5 elements. Maybe taking the middle 5 elements from certain rows.\n\nLooking at row 3 in input Example 0: the 2s start at index 3 and span 5 elements (indices 3-7). So maybe taking those 5 elements (2,2,2,2,2) as the first output row. Then row 4 has 2s in a pattern, perhaps the middle elements. But row 4's elements are [2,1,2,1,2], which might be the middle part of that row. Let's check:\n\nRow 4 of input is [1,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,1]. The middle part from index 4 to 8 might be [1,2,1,2,1], but the output is [2,1,2,1,2]. Hmm, maybe it's a different selection. Alternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking a vertical slice through the input where certain patterns occur.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a smaller matrix that's extracted from the input by focusing on regions where numbers other than the dominant one (like 1 in Example 0) form a certain shape, like a diamond. For example, the 2s and 3s might form a diamond shape, and the output captures the central part of that.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, the 2s form a sort of diamond or cross in the middle rows. The output could be the central 5x5 area of that shape. Wait, the output is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the input rows for Example 0, rows 3 to 7 (indices 3-7) have 2s and 3s. The columns involved might be centered around column 6 (since the output rows are length 5). For example, in row 3, the 2s are from columns 3-7 (indices 3-7). Taking those would give [2,2,2,2,2], which matches the first output row. Then row 4 has [2,1,2,1,2] in columns 3-7? Let's see: row 4 is [1,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,1, ...]. Columns 3-7 would be 2,1,2,1,2. Yes, which matches the second output row. Similarly, row 5: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1, ...]. Columns 3-7 would be 1,1,1,1,1. But the output's third row is [1,1,1,1,2]. Wait, maybe there's a different selection. Hmm, perhaps the columns are not fixed but vary per row based on where the pattern occurs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is capturing the central cross of the non-background elements. For example, in Example 0, the 2s form a vertical line in the middle, and the output captures that cross. Alternatively, it's a diamond shape.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output dimensions. The examples' outputs have varying lengths. Example 0's output is 5 rows each of 5 elements. Example 1's output is 5 rows of 3 elements. Example 2's output is 5 rows of 3 elements. Example 3's output is 3 rows of 5 elements. So the output size isn't fixed, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row corresponds to a certain pattern in the input rows. For instance, the output is formed by taking the central elements of regions where the number changes. Let's consider another angle: maybe the output is the result of applying a certain convolution or kernel that detects shapes like crosses or diamonds.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nThe output's first row is all 2s. In the input, the 2s form a horizontal line in row 3. The output's first row is [2,2,2,2,2], which could be the five 2s from row 3. The next row in the output is [2,1,2,1,2], which matches row 4 of the input's columns 3-7. Similarly, row 5 of the input has a single 2 in column 7 (if 0-based), but the output's third row is [1,1,1,1,2]. Maybe there's a vertical component here. Alternatively, maybe the output is a diamond shape where each layer represents a certain distance from the center.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a crosshair, where the middle row is the horizontal line of a cross, and the other rows are vertical lines. But this might not fit all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nThe output has rows [8,4,8], [4,4,4], [8,4,8], etc. Looking at the input, there's a 4 forming a cross or diamond. For instance, row 9 has [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8]. The middle 3 elements here are 4,4,4. Then row 8 has 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8], so the middle element is 4. This could form a vertical line. The output seems to capture a vertical line of 4s in the middle, surrounded by 8s. So maybe the output is a vertical slice through the 4s and surrounding numbers.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Perhaps the output is the minimal bounding box around a certain pattern (like a cross or diamond) formed by a different number than the surrounding.\n\nAnother approach: Each example's output seems to capture a small pattern that's present in the input. For instance, in Example 0, the 2s and 3s form a sort of diamond shape, and the output is the diamond's center. Alternatively, the output is the largest such shape found in the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the central part of a symmetrical structure. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the output is symmetric. The first and last rows are all 2s, and the middle rows have alternating 1s and 2s. This could correspond to a diamond pattern where the middle rows have fewer elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by looking for regions where the same number is present in a cross shape (like a plus sign) and then extracting that cross. For example, in Example 0's input, the 2s in row 3 form a horizontal line. Then, in column 5 (assuming 0-based), there's a vertical line of 2s. But that's not exactly the case. Let me check.\n\nRow 3 of Example 0: [1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,3,1]. The 2s are from columns 3-7 (indices 3 to 7). Then, in column 5 (center of the 2s), looking vertically, rows 3-7: row 3 has 2s, row 4 has 2, row 5 has 2 at column 7, which might not align. Hmm, perhaps not a cross.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the minimal rectangle that encloses all instances of a certain number (or numbers) that form a particular shape, like a diamond. For example, in Example 0, the 2s and 3s form a diamond, and the output is the central part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking the middle rows and columns where a certain pattern occurs. For example, in Example 0's input, the 2s are in rows 3-7. The middle of those rows is row 5. The output has 5 rows, so maybe rows 3-7 (inclusive) are selected, and for each row, the central 5 columns. Let's check:\n\nRow 3: columns 3-7 are [2,2,2,2,2] \u2192 output's first row.\nRow 4: columns 3-7 are [2,1,2,1,2] \u2192 output's second row.\nRow 5: columns 3-7 are [1,1,1,1,2] \u2192 output's third row.\nRow 6: same as row 4 \u2192 [2,1,2,1,2]?\nWait, row 6 in Example 0's input is [1,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,1]. So columns 3-7 would be [2,1,2,1,2], which matches the output's second row. Then row 7 of the input is [1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1,...], columns 3-7 \u2192 [2,2,2,2,2], which would be the output's fifth row. So the output is taking rows 3-7 (indices 3 to 7) and for each of those rows, taking columns 3-7 (indices 3 to 7). That's 5 rows and 5 columns, which matches the output's 5x5 structure. Let me check:\n\nYes, in Example 0, the output is a 5x5 grid taken from the input's rows 3-7 and columns 3-7. Let's verify:\n\nRow 3 in input (index 3): columns 3-7 are 2,2,2,2,2 \u2192 output row 0.\nRow 4 (index4): columns 3-7 are 2,1,2,1,2 \u2192 output row1.\nRow5 (index5): columns3-7: 1,1,1,1,2 \u2192 output row2.\nRow6 (index6): same as row4? Let's see row6: [1,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,...]. Columns3-7: 2,1,2,1,2 \u2192 same as row4. So output row3 would be same as row1.\nRow7 (index7): columns3-7: 2,2,2,2,2 \u2192 same as row0. So output rows are [2,2,2,2,2], [2,1,2,1,2], [1,1,1,1,2], [2,1,2,1,2], [2,2,2,2,2], which matches the output given. So the pattern here is extracting a 5x5 submatrix from rows 3-7 and columns3-7.\n\nNow let's check Example1. The output is 5 rows with 3 elements each. So perhaps the extracted submatrix is rows 5-9 (assuming 5 rows) and columns 11-13 (3 elements). Let's look at Example1's input:\n\nThe output is [8,4,8], [4,4,4], [8,4,8], [4,4,4], [8,4,8]. Let's check the input rows. For example, row9 of input is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8]. Wait, the output's first row is [8,4,8]. If the columns are 11-13 (assuming 0-based), then columns 11,12,13 would be 8,4,8 (row8: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8]. Columns 11 is 8, 12 is 4, 13 is 8. So that gives [8,4,8]. Then row9 has columns 11-13 as 8,4,4? Wait, row9's input is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8]. Columns 11 is 4 (since the list starts at index 0?), so columns 11 would be index11: 4, 12:4, 13:4 \u2192 [4,4,4], which matches the second row of the output. Then row10: [8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8]. Columns11-13 would be 8,4,8. So that would be [8,4,8]. Row11: [8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8]. Columns11-13 are 4,4,4 \u2192 [4,4,4]. Row12: [6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8]. Columns11-13 are 8,4,8 \u2192 [8,4,8]. So the output rows are taken from rows8,9,10,11,12, columns11-13. That's a 5x3 matrix. So in Example1, the output is a 5x3 submatrix from rows 8-12 and columns 11-13.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the output is a submatrix (of varying size) extracted from specific rows and columns in the input. The question is, how are these rows and columns determined?\n\nLooking at Example0 and Example1, the submatrix seems to be centered around the region where a certain number (other than the dominant background number) is forming a pattern. For Example0, the 2s and 3s are in the middle. For Example1, the 4s are in columns 11-13 and rows around there.\n\nAnother example: Example2's output is 5 rows of 3 elements. Let's see the input. The output is [8,8,8], [8,2,2], [8,8,8], [2,2,8], [8,8,8]. Looking at the input rows for Example2:\n\nIn the input, there's a section where 8s are present. For instance, rows 2-4 have 8s. Let's check row2: [2,2,2,2,8,8,8,2,2,...]. Columns4-6 (indices4-6) would be 8,8,8 \u2192 which matches the first output row. Row3: [2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,...]. Columns4-6:8,2,2 \u2192 which matches the second output row. Row4: columns4-6:8,8,8 \u2192 third output row. Then row5: [2,2,2,2,2,2,8,2,...]. Columns4-6:2,2,8 \u2192 fourth output row. Row6: same as row2:8,8,8 \u2192 fifth output row. So the output is rows 2-6, columns4-6. That's a 5x3 matrix. So again, the output is a submatrix extracted from the input.\n\nSimilarly, Example3's output is 3 rows of 5 elements. Let's check:\n\nThe output is [1,3,3,3,1], [3,3,1,3,3], [1,3,3,3,1]. Looking at the input for Example3:\n\nIn the input rows, there's a section with 3s. For example, rows 9-11. Let's check row9: [2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1]. Columns9-13 (assuming 0-based) are 3,3,3,1,1 \u2192 but the first output row is [1,3,3,3,1]. Maybe columns8-12. Let's see:\n\nRow9: columns8-12:1,3,3,3,1 \u2192 yes, that matches the first output row. Row10: [2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,1,1,1,1]. Columns8-12:3,3,1,3,3 \u2192 second output row. Row11: [2,1,1,2,2,2,2,1,1,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1]. Columns8-12:3,3,3,1,1 \u2192 but the third output row is [1,3,3,3,1]. Hmm, maybe different rows. Alternatively, rows9-11, columns9-13? Let's see row9: columns9-13:3,3,3,1,1 \u2192 not matching. Maybe the rows are 10-12. Let's check row10's columns8-12:3,3,1,3,3. Row11's columns8-12:3,3,3,1,1. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the extracted submatrix is 3 rows high and 5 columns wide, centered around the 3s. \n\nBut in Example3's output, the first and third rows are [1,3,3,3,1], which suggests a symmetric pattern. Perhaps the output is taking rows 9-11 (or similar) and columns where the 3s are present. For example, in row9, the 3s are in columns9-11 (indices9-11). But the output has 5 elements. Maybe expanding the columns to include surrounding elements. For row9, columns8-12:1,3,3,3,1 \u2192 which matches the first output row. Similarly, row10's columns7-11:1,3,3,1,3 \u2192 but the output's second row is [3,3,1,3,3]. Maybe columns8-12 for row10:3,3,1,3,3 \u2192 which matches. Then row11's columns8-12:3,3,3,1,1 \u2192 but the third output row is [1,3,3,3,1]. Maybe there's a mistake here, or perhaps it's a different selection.\n\nBut regardless, the pattern seems to be that the output is a submatrix extracted from the input, focusing on a region where a certain number (not the background) forms a specific pattern. The key is to find the location of this submatrix in the test input.\n\nSo, applying this to the test input:\n\nThe test input is a series of rows. We need to find the submatrix that fits the pattern observed in the training examples. Let's examine the test input rows.\n\nLooking for regions where numbers other than 3 are present. The test input starts with rows filled with 3s. Then, in row2 (third row) of the test input, we have:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nThen row3:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,1,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow4:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nSo rows2-4 have some 1s. Then in rows5-8, there's a 6:\n\nRow5: [3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow6: [3,3,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow7: [3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow8: [3,3,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nThen rows12-17 have 8s:\n\nRow12: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow13: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow14: [3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow15: [3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow16: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow17: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nSo the test input has two regions of interest: one with 1s in rows2-4 and columns9-12, and another with 6s in rows5-8 and columns3-5, and 8s in rows12-17 and columns8-11.\n\nNow, the output should be the submatrix extracted from one of these regions. Let's see which one matches the pattern observed in the training examples.\n\nLooking at the regions:\n\n1. The 1s in rows2-4 and columns9-12. This region has a pattern that forms a diamond or cross. For example:\n\nRow2: ...3,1,3,1,1,3...\nRow3: ...3,1,1,3,1,3...\nRow4: ...3,1,3,1,1,3...\n\nThis might form a small cross or diamond. But the 1s are scattered. Maybe not a clear pattern.\n\n2. The 6s in rows5-8, columns3-5:\n\nRow5: 6 at column3.\nRow6: 6,6,6 at columns2-4.\nRow7: 6 at column3.\nRow8: 6,6,6 at columns2-4.\n\nThis forms a vertical line of 6s with some horizontal elements. Maybe forming a cross.\n\n3. The 8s in rows12-17, columns8-11:\n\nRows12-13: 8s at columns8-9.\nRows14-15: 8s from columns6-11 (forming a horizontal line).\nRows16-17: 8s at columns8-9.\n\nThis looks like a diamond shape. The middle rows (14-15) have a longer horizontal line, and the top and bottom have shorter lines.\n\nGiven the training examples, especially Example0 which had a diamond shape extracted, perhaps the 8s in the test input form a diamond, and the output is the central part of that.\n\nLooking at the 8s in rows14-15: they form a horizontal line of 6 8s. The rows above and below (12-13 and 16-17) have two 8s each. This might form a diamond shape.\n\nIf we take the rows 12-16 (indices12-16) and columns8-9 (since the 8s are centered there), but rows14-15 have more 8s. Alternatively, considering that the diamond expands and contracts, the central rows (14-15) have the widest part. So the diamond would be:\n\nRow14: columns6-11 are 8s (indices6-11: 6 elements)\nRow15: same as row14.\nRows13 and 16: columns8-9 (indices8-9) have 8s.\nRow12: columns8-9 have 8s.\nRow17: columns8-9 have 8s.\n\nWait, the 8s in rows14-15 are longer. So the diamond might be formed by:\n\nRow14: 8s from column6 to 11 (indices6-11: 6 elements)\nRow15: same as row14\nRow13 and row16: 8s from columns8-9 (indices8-9)\nRow12 and row17: 8s from columns8-9.\n\nSo the diamond is 5 rows high (rows12-16) and centered around columns8-9. The widest part is in rows14-15, covering 6 columns, but perhaps the output is taking the central part. However, the output examples sometimes take a submatrix around the central pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the minimal bounding box around the 8s. The 8s are present in rows12-17 (indices12-17), columns6-11 (for rows14-15), and columns8-9 for rows12-13 and 16-17. But this might form a larger structure. However, the output needs to be a small matrix. \n\nAlternatively, focusing on the rows where the 8s are present and taking the central part. For example, rows14-15 have 8s from columns6-11. If we take a vertical slice through the center of these rows, perhaps columns8-9. But the output in the examples sometimes has varying widths. For instance, Example0's output is 5x5, Example1's is 5x3. So perhaps the test case's output is a 5x5 matrix taken from the 8s' region. Let's check:\n\nThe 8s in rows14-15 are from columns6-11. The central column would be column8-9. If we take columns7-11 for each row, but it's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the output is a vertical slice. But considering the test input's 8s structure, the largest horizontal span is in rows14-15 (columns6-11), which is 6 columns. The central 3 columns would be columns8-10. But let's look at the training examples for guidance.\n\nIn Example1, the output was a vertical slice of 5 rows and 3 columns. The test case's 8s form a structure that's wider in the middle. If we take the rows where 8s are present and extract columns around the center, maybe columns8-10 for rows12-16. Let's check:\n\nRow12: columns8-9 are 8s, columns10 is 3. So row12, columns8-10:8,8,3 \u2192 but we need 8s. Maybe columns8-9.\n\nBut the output examples have varying numbers. Let's think differently. Perhaps the test case's output is the 5 rows corresponding to the vertical diamond of 8s, and each row's elements are the 8s in those rows. For example:\n\nRow12: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]. The 8s are in columns8-9. So taking columns8-9: [8,8].\n\nRow13: same as row12 \u2192 [8,8].\n\nRow14: [3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3]. Columns6-11 are 8s. Taking the middle part: columns8-9 are 8,8. But the entire row has 8s from 6-11. If we take the middle 3 columns: columns7-9 (8,8,8). But the output needs to be consistent. Alternatively, maybe the output is 3 columns wide, centered on columns8-10.\n\nRow14's columns8-10:8,8,8.\n\nRow15: same as row14.\n\nRow16: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]. Columns8-9:8,8.\n\nIf we take rows12-16 and columns8-10, we'd get:\n\nRow12:8,8,3\n\nRow13:8,8,3\n\nRow14:8,8,8\n\nRow15:8,8,8\n\nRow16:8,8,3\n\nBut the output examples have varying patterns. Alternatively, perhaps the output is centered on the widest part. For rows14-15 (the widest), take columns6-11 (6 elements), but that's 6 elements. The output examples don't have even numbers, so maybe a 5-element row. Alternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the minimal region that contains all the 8s. For rows12-17 and columns6-11. But that's a 6-row, 6-column area. However, the output examples have varying sizes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the same as Example0's approach, taking the central 5 rows and 5 columns. Let's check the test input's rows for a region where a 5x5 submatrix can be extracted.\n\nLooking for a region where there's a cluster of non-3 numbers. The 6s are in rows5-8 and columns3-5. Let's see:\n\nRow5: [3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow6: [3,3,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow7: [3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow8: [3,3,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nSo rows5-8 have 6s in columns3-5 (row5 has column3 as6, row6 columns3-5 as6, etc.). The central rows for this cluster are rows6 and8 (both have three 6s). If we take rows5-9 (5 rows) and columns3-7 (5 columns), but let's check:\n\nRow5: columns3-7:6,3,3,3,3 \u2192 [6,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow6: columns3-7:6,6,6,3,3 \u2192 [6,6,6,3,3]\n\nRow7: columns3-7:6,3,3,3,3 \u2192 [6,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow8: columns3-7:6,6,6,3,3 \u2192 [6,6,6,3,3]\n\nRow9: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] \u2192 columns3-7:3,3,3,3,3.\n\nThis would give an output of:\n\n[6,3,3,3,3]\n\n[6,6,6,3,3]\n\n[6,3,3,3,3]\n\n[6,6,6,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' structure. Alternatively, perhaps the output is focusing on the 6s. For example, the 6s form a vertical line in the middle. But the rows with 6s are 5-8. If we take rows5-9 and columns3-7, but the output would have varying elements.\n\nAlternatively, the region with 8s is more prominent. Let's look at the 8s in rows12-17. The widest part is rows14-15, columns6-11. If we take rows14-15 and columns6-11, that's two rows of 6 elements each. But the output examples have 5 rows. So perhaps this isn't the right region.\n\nAlternatively, the region with 1s in rows2-4. Let's check:\n\nRow2: columns9-13:1,3,1,1,3 \u2192 but it's not a clear pattern.\n\nRow3: columns9-13:1,1,3,1,3 \u2192 again, scattered.\n\nRow4: columns9-13:1,3,1,1,3 \u2192 similar to row2.\n\nNot a clear pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test input's output is based on the 6s. Let's see:\n\nThe 6s are in rows5-8. The central rows are 6-7 (indices6-7). If we take a 5-row section around them, perhaps rows4-8. For each of those rows, extract columns3-7. Let's see:\n\nRow4: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,3] \u2192 columns3-7:3,3,3,3,3.\n\nRow5: columns3-7:3,6,3,3,3.\n\nRow6: columns3-7:6,6,6,3,3.\n\nRow7: columns3-7:3,6,3,3,3.\n\nRow8: columns3-7:6,6,6,3,3.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,6,3,3,3]\n\n[6,6,6,3,3]\n\n[3,6,3,3,3]\n\n[6,6,6,3,3]\n\nBut this doesn't match any training example's pattern. The training examples often have symmetry or a central pattern.\n\nAnother approach: the output is the largest possible diamond shape in the input. For the test input, the 8s form a diamond. The diamond's rows are 12-17, with the widest part in rows14-15. The columns for the diamond are 6-11 in rows14-15, and narrowing towards rows12 and 17. But how to extract this as a submatrix.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be a 5-row matrix focusing on the 8s. Let's take rows12-16 (5 rows) and columns8-9 (2 columns). But that would give a 5x2 matrix, which doesn't match any training example's output. Or columns6-11 (6 columns) for rows14-15. But the output examples have varying column counts. Example3's output is 5 columns, others are 3 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 5-row, 3-column matrix taken from the central part of the 8s. Let's check rows13-17 and columns8-10.\n\nRow13: columns8-10:8,8,3.\n\nRow14: columns8-10:8,8,8.\n\nRow15: columns8-10:8,8,8.\n\nRow16: columns8-10:8,8,3.\n\nRow17: columns8-10:8,8,3.\n\nThis would give:\n\n[8,8,3]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nBut this doesn't form a symmetric pattern. Alternatively, focusing on the rows12-16 and columns6-10.\n\nRow12: columns6-10:3,3,3,8,8.\n\nRow13: columns6-10:3,3,3,8,8.\n\nRow14: columns6-10:8,8,8,8,8.\n\nRow15: columns6-10:8,8,8,8,8.\n\nRow16: columns6-10:3,3,3,8,8.\n\nThis would give:\n\n[3,3,3,8,8]\n\n[3,3,3,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[3,3,3,8,8]\n\nBut this also doesn't seem to match the training examples' structure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the central 3 columns and 5 rows of the 8s' structure. For example, rows14-15 have 8s from columns6-11. The central columns would be 8-9. Taking rows12-16 (5 rows) and columns8-9 (2 columns). But this gives a 5x2 matrix, which doesn't match any training example.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another pattern. The training examples all have outputs that are odd in both dimensions (5x5, 5x3, 3x5), which suggests that they're centered around a middle element. For example, a 5x5 matrix has a center at row2, column2. Maybe the pattern involves finding the center of the non-background elements and extracting a certain size around it.\n\nIn Example0, the 2s and 3s form a pattern. The center might be at row5 (index5), column7 (the 2 in row5). The submatrix is rows3-7 (5 rows), columns3-7 (5 columns), centered around row5, column7. \n\nIn Example1, the 4s are centered around row10, column12. The submatrix is rows8-12 (5 rows), columns11-13 (3 columns).\n\nIn Example2, the 8s are centered around row3, column5. The submatrix is rows2-6 (5 rows), columns4-6 (3 columns).\n\nExample3's output is 3 rows of 5 elements. The 3s are centered around row10, column10. The submatrix could be rows9-11 (3 rows), columns8-12 (5 columns).\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFind the center of the non-background pattern. Then extract a submatrix of a certain size (5x5, 5x3, etc.) around that center. The size depends on the shape of the non-background pattern.\n\nFor the test input, the main non-background numbers are 1s, 6s, and 8s. The 8s form the largest pattern. Let's find their center.\n\nThe 8s are in rows12-17, columns6-11 (rows14-15 are the widest). The center of this structure would be around row14.5 (between 14 and 15) and column8.5 (between columns8 and9). So the center is at row14, column8 or 9.\n\nIf we extract a 5-row by 3-column submatrix centered at row14, column8-9, then rows12-16 and columns7-9.\n\nLet's check:\n\nRow12: columns7-9:3,8,8.\n\nRow13: columns7-9:3,8,8.\n\nRow14: columns7-9:8,8,8.\n\nRow15: columns7-9:8,8,8.\n\nRow16: columns7-9:3,8,8.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[3,8,8]\n\n[3,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[3,8,8]\n\nBut this doesn't match any training example's pattern. Alternatively, maybe the 6s are the main focus. The 6s are in rows5-8, columns3-5. The center would be row6.5 and column4. So taking rows4-8 (5 rows) and columns2-6 (5 columns).\n\nRow4: columns2-6:3,3,3,3,3.\n\nRow5: columns2-6:3,3,6,3,3.\n\nRow6: columns2-6:3,6,6,6,3.\n\nRow7: columns2-6:3,3,6,3,3.\n\nRow8: columns2-6:3,6,6,6,3.\n\nThis would give:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,6,3,3]\n\n[3,6,6,6,3]\n\n[3,3,6,3,3]\n\n[3,6,6,6,3]\n\nThis forms a diamond pattern similar to Example0's output, which is all 2s around the edges and a cross in the middle. However, the test input's output would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,6,3,3]\n\n[3,6,6,6,3]\n\n[3,3,6,3,3]\n\n[3,6,6,6,3]\n\nBut the training examples have outputs where the numbers form a certain structure, often with a different number in the center. However, this doesn't match any of the training example patterns exactly. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the test input's 6s form a cross similar to Example0's 2s, maybe the output is a 5x5 submatrix centered around the 6s. Let's check:\n\nTaking rows5-9 (indices5-9) and columns3-7 (indices3-7):\n\nRow5: [3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] \u2192 columns3-7:6,3,3,3,3 \u2192 [6,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow6: [3,3,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] \u2192 columns3-7:6,6,6,3,3 \u2192 [6,6,6,3,3]\n\nRow7: [3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] \u2192 columns3-7:3,6,3,3,3 \u2192 [3,6,3,3,3]\n\nRow8: [3,3,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] \u2192 columns3-7:6,6,6,3,3 \u2192 [6,6,6,3,3]\n\nRow9: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] \u2192 columns3-7:3,3,3,3,3 \u2192 [3,3,3,3,3]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[6,3,3,3,3]\n\n[6,6,6,3,3]\n\n[3,6,3,3,3]\n\n[6,6,6,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3]\n\nThis doesn't match the training examples' symmetry. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to make a decision, I'll consider that the test input's output is derived from the 8s region, as they form the most prominent non-3 pattern. The output is likely a 5-row submatrix centered around the 8s, with 3 columns. For example, rows12-16 and columns8-10:\n\nRow12:8,8,3 \u2192 [8,8,3]\n\nRow13:8,8,3 \u2192 [8,8,3]\n\nRow14:8,8,8 \u2192 [8,8,8]\n\nRow15:8,8,8 \u2192 [8,8,8]\n\nRow16:8,8,3 \u2192 [8,8,3]\n\nBut this gives 5 rows of 3 elements each. However, the middle rows (14-15) are all 8s, which matches the training example's patterns where the middle row has the same number. The output would be:\n\n[8,8,3]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this aligns with the training examples. Alternatively, maybe the columns are 7-9, giving:\n\nRow12:3,8,8 \u2192 [3,8,8]\n\nRow13:3,8,8 \u2192 [3,8,8]\n\nRow14:8,8,8 \u2192 [8,8,8]\n\nRow15:8,8,8 \u2192 [8,8,8]\n\nRow16:3,8,8 \u2192 [3,8,8]\n\nThis would create a symmetrical output:\n\n[3,8,8]\n\n[3,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[3,8,8]\n\nThis is similar to Example1's output, which had 8,4,8 in the top and bottom rows and 4,4,4 in the middle. Similarly, this test output has 3,8,8 in the top and bottom, and 8,8,8 in the middle. But Example1's output alternated between 8,4,8 and 4,4,4. However, the pattern here is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the 5-row, 3-column matrix centered on the 8s' widest part:\n\nRows13-17 and columns8-10:\n\nRow13:8,8,3 \u2192 [8,8,3]\n\nRow14:8,8,8 \u2192 [8,8,8]\n\nRow15:8,8,8 \u2192 [8,8,8]\n\nRow16:8,8,3 \u2192 [8,8,3]\n\nRow17:8,8,3 \u2192 [8,8,3]\n\nBut this would have rows13-17, which is 5 rows. The output would be:\n\n[8,8,3]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nThis doesn't match any training example's structure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the assumption that the output is a 5-row, 3-column matrix centered around the 8s, resulting in the following output:\n\n[8,8,3]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\n[8,8,3]\n\nBut I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, the 6s region might be the focus, leading to a different output. However, considering the training examples, especially Example0 where the submatrix was a diamond, the 8s' diamond seems more likely. But I'm not sure.",
