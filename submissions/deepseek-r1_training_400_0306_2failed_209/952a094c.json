        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are these input grids and output grids, and I need to see how the input is transformed into the output. Let's start by looking at the training examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a sort of rectangle made of 8s. Inside that rectangle, there are numbers like 4,3,0,2,6. The output has those inner numbers (4,3,2,6) moved to the outer edges. For instance, in the input's fourth row, there's 8,4,3,8. In the output, those 4 and 3 are now in the bottom middle (row 7, columns 2 and 7) as 3 and 4. Similarly, the 2 and 6 in the input's fifth row move up to row 1, columns 2 and 7. Also, the original positions where those numbers were are now 0 in the output. So maybe the numbers inside the rectangle are being moved to the perimeter of the grid, perhaps mirrored or rotated somehow?\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has a larger rectangle of 7s and some numbers inside: 2,8,9,3. The output moves these numbers to the outer edges. The 2 moves to the bottom row, column 8. The 9 is in row 1, column 8. The 3 is in row 1, column 1. The 8 is in row 8, column 1. So it seems like the numbers from the inner part of the rectangle are moved to the outermost rows and columns, but their positions are mirrored. For example, in the input, the 2 is in row 3, column 4. In the output, it's at the bottom (row 8) column 8. Wait, maybe their positions are reflected across the center. Let's check the coordinates.\n\nIn Example 0, the 4 was at (3,4) [if rows are 0-indexed? Wait, the example starts rows from 0? Let me see. Let's consider the first row as row 0. So input example 0's 4 is at row 3, column 4. The output's 4 is at row 7, column 7. If the grid is 10x10, then row 7 is symmetric to row 3 if mirrored vertically. Similarly, column 7 is symmetric to column 3 (since 10-3-1=6, but maybe not exact). Wait, maybe the numbers are moved to the opposite side of the rectangle. The rectangle in example 0 is from row 2 to row 6, and columns 3 to 6. So the 4 is inside this rectangle. In the output, it's placed outside, maybe on the perimeter of the grid. Wait, but the output's 4 is at row7, column7. Hmm, maybe each number is moved to the corresponding position outside the rectangle, but mirrored.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number inside the rectangle is moved to the first or last row or column of the grid, in the same relative position. For example, in Example 0, the 4 is in row3, column4. The output places 4 at row7, column7. So if the rectangle is between rows 2-6 and columns 3-6, then the numbers inside are moved to the edges of the grid. Maybe the numbers are moved to the top and bottom rows, and leftmost and rightmost columns, but mirrored. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 2 at row3, column4. The output has 2 at row8, column8. The 9 is at row6, column4, which in output is row1, column8. The 3 is at row6, column6, which becomes row8, column1? Or maybe the numbers are moved to the perimeter rows (row1 and row8 in the output), and their positions are mirrored. For instance, if the original position is (x,y) inside the rectangle, then the mirrored position would be (10-1 -x, 10-1 -y), but that's if it's a 10x10 grid. Wait, 10 rows and columns, indices 0-9. So, 9- x and 9- y. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0, 4 is at (3,4). 9-3=6, 9-4=5. But in the output, 4 is at (7,7). Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are moved to the perimeter based on their position relative to the rectangle. For example, in the input, the rectangle is surrounded by 8s. The numbers inside are placed in the output's perimeter, perhaps at the same distance from the rectangle's edge as they were from the center. Alternatively, maybe each number is moved to the closest perimeter cell outside the rectangle, but then how?\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, the numbers that were inside the rectangle in the input are now outside, but arranged in a way that their positions are symmetrical. For example, in Example0, the original numbers 4,3,2,6 are moved to positions (7,2) 3, (7,7) 4, (1,2) 6, (1,7) 2. Wait, no. The output's first non-zero in example0 is row1, column2 is 6, row1 column7 is 2. Then in row7, column2 is 3, column7 is 4. So the numbers 2,6,3,4 are placed in those positions. Let's see their original positions.\n\nOriginal input example0:\n\nRow3 (0-based) is [0,0,0,8,4,3,8,0,0,0]. So 4 is at (3,4), 3 at (3,5).\n\nRow5 is [0,0,0,8,2,6,8,0,0,0]. 2 at (5,4), 6 at (5,5).\n\nIn output:\n\nRow1: [0,0,6,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. So 6 at (1,2), 2 at (1,7).\n\nRow7: [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]. 3 at (7,2), 4 at (7,7).\n\nSo the original positions (3,4) \u2192 (7,7), (3,5) \u2192 (7,2), (5,4) \u2192 (1,2), (5,5) \u2192 (1,7). Hmm, that seems like a 180 degree rotation? Because (3,4) in a 10x10 grid would be mirrored over the center. The center is between rows 4.5 and columns 4.5. So for row 3, mirror would be row 6 (since 3 + (9-3) =6?), and column 4 would be mirrored to 5. Wait, maybe the positions are mirrored over the vertical and horizontal center.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are being moved to the opposite side of the rectangle. The rectangle in example0 is from row2 to row6 (inclusive), columns3 to 6. The 4 is inside at (3,4). The output's 4 is at (7,7), which is outside the rectangle. If the rectangle is 5 rows tall (rows2-6), then moving down from row3 to row7 (which is 4 rows down). But how does that fit? Alternatively, the numbers are moved to the perimeter of the entire grid, but in a certain way.\n\nLooking at Example1. The input has a rectangle from row2 to row7 (assuming rows are 0-based), columns2 to7. Inside that, there are numbers at (3,3)=2, (3,6)=8, (6,3)=9, (6,6)=3. In the output, 2 is at (8,8), 8 at (8,1), 9 at (1,8), 3 at (1,1). Wait, but the output example1's first row (row1) has 3 at column1 (row1, column1) and 9 at column8. The row8 has 8 at column1 and 2 at column8. So the numbers are placed at the corners of the grid? Wait, (1,1), (1,8), (8,1), (8,8). But in the input, the original positions were (3,3), (3,6), (6,3), (6,6). So, for example, the original (3,3) (row3, column3) becomes (8,8). How?\n\nIf the grid is 10x10, then row indices 0-9. Original row3, column3. To get to row8, column8: 3 +5=8, 3+5=8. Similarly, (3,6): 3+5=8, 6+2=8? No, that doesn't fit. Maybe it's mirrored. For example, (3,3) \u2192 (9-3=6,9-3=6) \u2192 but that's (6,6). But in the output, it's (8,8). Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, the numbers are moved to the outer edge rows (row1 and row8) and columns (columns1 and 8). How? For example, in example1's input, 2 is at (3,3). Output has 2 at (8,8). So perhaps adding 5 to the row and column indices: 3+5=8. But 3+5=8, 3+5=8. Similarly, (6,6) in input (3's original position) becomes (1,1). Wait, 6-5=1. So maybe numbers in rows <=4 are moved to row8, and rows >=5 are moved to row1? Not sure. Alternatively, the numbers are moved to the opposite edge. For example, the original rectangle's top is row2, bottom row6. So any number in the top half of the rectangle moves to the top edge, and bottom half to the bottom edge. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: in each example, the output has the same structure of the rectangle (the 8s, 7s, etc.) but the inner numbers are replaced with 0s, and their values are moved to the perimeter. The movement seems to be such that numbers from the top of the rectangle go to the bottom perimeter, and bottom to top, left to right, etc. For example, in example0, the 4 and 3 were in the third row (closer to the top of the rectangle), and they end up in the seventh row (closer to the bottom). Similarly, the 2 and 6 in row5 (closer to the middle or bottom of the rectangle) end up in row1 (top). So it's like flipping the positions vertically across the rectangle's center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are moved to the perimeter of the grid, but their positions relative to the rectangle's edges determine where they end up. For example, a number in the top half of the rectangle is moved to the bottom perimeter, and vice versa. Similarly for left and right.\n\nLooking at example2. Input has a rectangle of 1s. Inside are numbers 2,5,6,3. The output moves them to the top and bottom rows. For example, 2 is in row2, column5. Output's row6, column7 is 2. Wait, row6 is near the bottom. But the input's rectangle is from row1 to row5. So perhaps the numbers from the top half of the rectangle are moved to the bottom and vice versa. Let's see. In example2, the input's 2 is at (2,2), which is in the top of the rectangle. Output's 2 is at row6, column7. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the numbers are placed symmetrically around the grid's center.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the output for example0 has the numbers 6 and 2 in the top row (row1) and 3 and4 in the bottom row (row7). Similarly, example1's output has 3 and9 in the top row and 8 and2 in the bottom row. Example2's output has 3 and6 in the top row and 5 and2 in the bottom. So maybe each number inside the rectangle is moved to a position that's a certain distance away. For example, in example0, the numbers 2 and6 are in the fifth row (middle of the rectangle) and are moved to the first row. The numbers 4 and3 in the third row (upper half) are moved to the seventh row (lower half). So perhaps each number's row is transformed as (original_row - center_row) *2 + center_row? For example, if the rectangle's center is row4 (since rows2-6), then a number at row3 (one above center) would be moved to row5 (one below), but in example0, row3 becomes row7. Hmm, maybe it's mirrored across the center of the rectangle. The rectangle's vertical center is at row (2+6)/2=4. So row3 is one above center, so mirroring would place it at row5. But in the output, it's moved to row7. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, mirrored across the entire grid's center. The grid's center is between rows4.5 and columns4.5. So a number at (3,4) would mirror to (6,5). But example0's output for 4 is at (7,7). Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are moved to the outer edges in a way that their original positions relative to the rectangle's edges determine their new positions. For example, in example0, the rectangle spans from column3 to column6. The number 4 is in column4, which is inside. To move it to the rightmost edge (column9?), but in the output it's at column7. Not exactly. But the output's columns for the numbers are 2 and7. Maybe the numbers are moved to the left and right edges of the grid based on their original position's horizontal offset within the rectangle. For instance, in example0's rectangle, columns3-6 (width 4 columns). The 4 is at column4 (second column inside the rectangle). Maybe this maps to column7 (second from the right in the grid's rightmost positions). But 10 columns, so columns0-9. Left edge is column0, right edge column9. Maybe numbers from the left half of the rectangle move to the left edge, and right half to the right edge. But example0's 4 is at column4, which is the second column of the rectangle (columns3-6: columns3 is first, 4 second, 5 third, 6 fourth). So column4 is second, so maybe mapped to column7 (third from left?) Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number inside the rectangle is moved to the perimeter of the grid in a way that the direction from the rectangle's center to the number's position determines the direction to the perimeter. For example, a number to the left of the center would be moved to the left edge, and similarly for other directions. Let's see:\n\nIn example0's rectangle (columns3-6, center at column4.5). The number 4 is at column4 (slightly left of center), but in the output it's moved to column7 (right edge). Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe if the number is in the top half of the rectangle, it's moved to the bottom edge, and vice versa. Similarly, left/right. So, for example, a number in the top-left quadrant of the rectangle would be moved to the bottom-right edge of the grid. Let's test this.\n\nIn example0, the 4 is at (3,4). The rectangle's vertical center is row4 (rows2-6), so row3 is top half. The horizontal center is column4.5. Column4 is left of center. So moving to the bottom-right edge. The output's 4 is at row7, column7 (bottom-right part). That fits. Similarly, the 3 is at (3,5), which is top-right quadrant. So moved to row7, column2 (bottom-left?), but in the output, it's at (7,2) which is left side. Wait, that's left. So maybe the vertical direction is mirrored (top to bottom), and horizontal direction is mirrored (left to right). So a number in top-left moves to bottom-right. But 3 is in (3,5) which is top-right, so it would move to bottom-left? The output has 3 at (7,2). Hmm, column5 is right of center (4.5), so mirrored to column4 (since 5 - 4.5 = 0.5, mirrored would be 4.5 -0.5=4). But 5 mirrored around 4.5 is 4 (because 4.5 *2 -5 =4). So column5 becomes 4, but in the output, it's column2. That doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler pattern. Let's look at the numbers in the output. In example0, the numbers are 6,2,3,4. In example1, 3,9,8,2. In example2,3,6,5,2. It seems that the numbers are arranged in a certain order around the perimeter.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers inside the rectangle are moved to the perimeter in the order of their original positions, perhaps clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n\nIn example0's input, the numbers are 4,3 in row3 and 2,6 in row5. The output's perimeter has 6 and2 in the top row, and3 and4 in the bottom row. Maybe the order is top first, then bottom. But how?\n\nWait, looking at example0's output: row1 has 6 and 2 (columns2 and7), row7 has 3 and4 (columns2 and7). So maybe the numbers are arranged in pairs, with the ones from the top part of the rectangle going to the bottom perimeter, and the ones from the bottom part to the top. But how exactly?\n\nAnother approach: the numbers inside the rectangle are moved to the perimeter such that their original positions relative to the rectangle's borders determine their new positions. For example, a number that is closest to the top of the rectangle is moved to the bottom edge, and vice versa. Similarly for left and right.\n\nIn example0, the numbers 4 and3 are in row3 of the rectangle (which starts at row2). So row3 is two rows from the top (rows2,3,4,5,6). The rectangle is 5 rows high. So 4 and3 are in the second row of the rectangle (row3 - row2=1, so 0-based). So moving them to the bottom edge. Similarly, 2 and6 are in row5, which is three rows into the rectangle (row5 - row2=3), so perhaps moved to the top edge.\n\nBut how is this mapped? The output for example0's 4 and3 are in row7, which is one row above the bottom (assuming row9 is the last). So maybe the number of rows from the top of the rectangle determines how far from the bottom edge they are placed.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are placed in the same columns but mirrored vertically outside the rectangle. For example, the rectangle in example0 is from row2 to row6. A number at row3 (inside) would be mirrored to row (2 +6) -3 =5? But in output it's row7. Not sure.\n\nMaybe it's better to look for a pattern in how each example's input numbers are transformed to output positions.\n\nExample0:\nOriginal positions and output positions:\n4 \u2192 (3,4) \u2192 (7,7)\n3 \u2192 (3,5) \u2192 (7,2)\n2 \u2192 (5,4) \u2192 (1,2)\n6 \u2192 (5,5) \u2192 (1,7)\n\nExample1:\nOriginal positions and output:\n2 \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 (8,8)\n8 \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 (8,1)\n9 \u2192 (6,3) \u2192 (1,8)\n3 \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (1,1)\n\nExample2:\nOriginal positions:\n2 \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (6,7)\n5 \u2192 (2,5) \u2192 (0,0)\n6 \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 (0,7)\n3 \u2192 (4,5) \u2192 (6,0)\n\nWait, example2's output has 3 at row0, column0? Let's check. The output example2's first row is [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0]. So 3 at (0,0), 6 at (0,7). The sixth row is [5,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0], so 5 at (6,0), 2 at (6,7). So original positions:\n\n2 was at (2,2) \u2192 output at (6,7)\n5 was at (2,5) \u2192 (0,0)\n6 at (4,2) \u2192 (0,7)\n3 at (4,5) \u2192 (6,0)\n\nHmm, this seems like a mirroring across the center of the grid. For example, (2,2) \u2192 mirrored over (4.5,4.5) would be (7,7). But in example2's output, it's (6,7). Not matching. Alternatively, the numbers are moved to the opposite edge. For example, a number in row2 (near top) is moved to row6 (near bottom), and column2 to column7 (near right edge). So (row, column) becomes (9 - row, 9 - column) for 0-based indices. Let's test:\n\nFor example0's 4 at (3,4): 9-3=6,9-4=5 \u2192 (6,5). But output is (7,7). Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's (row, column) \u2192 (9 - original_row, 9 - original_column). Let's see example0's 4: (3,4) \u2192 (6,5). No, output is (7,7). So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, numbers are moved to positions that are symmetrical with respect to the rectangle's center. For example, the rectangle's center in example0 is row4 (since rows2-6), column4.5 (columns3-6). So for a number at (3,4), which is one row above and 0.5 columns left of the center, the mirrored position would be (5,5). But in the output, it's at (7,7). Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are moved to the perimeter in such a way that their new positions are at the same distance from the rectangle's edge as their original positions were from the opposite edge. For example, a number that is 1 unit away from the top edge of the rectangle is placed 1 unit away from the bottom edge of the grid. Let's see:\n\nIn example0, the rectangle's top edge is row2. The number 4 is at row3, which is 1 row below the top edge. The grid's bottom edge is row9. So placing it 1 row above the bottom edge would be row8. But in the output, it's at row7. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let's try to find another approach. Perhaps the numbers inside the rectangle are being rotated 180 degrees and placed outside. For example, in example0's 4 at (3,4) becomes (7,7). If you subtract 3 from 9 (since 9 is the last index), 9-3=6. 9-4=5. So (6,5), but output is (7,7). Not matching. Maybe it's (9 - row, column). No, 9-3=6, column4 \u2192 (6,4), but output is (7,7).\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are moved to the first and last rows and columns. Let's see:\n\nIn example0's output, 6 and 2 are in row1, columns2 and7. 3 and4 are in row7, columns2 and7. Similarly, in example1, the numbers are in row1 and8, columns1 and8. Example2 has numbers in row0 and6, columns0 and7. So maybe the numbers are placed in the first and last few rows, and the leftmost and rightmost columns. \n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output's numbers are placed in the same positions relative to the rectangle. For example, in example0, the rectangle is centered around columns3-6 and rows2-6. The output's numbers are placed in columns2 and7, which are just outside the rectangle's columns (3-6). Similarly, rows1 and7 are just outside the rectangle's rows (2-6). So perhaps the numbers are moved to the rows and columns immediately adjacent to the rectangle's edges. But in example0, the rectangle's left edge is column3, so the numbers are placed in column2 (left) and7 (right). Similarly, rows1 (above) and7 (below).\n\nBut the numbers are not all adjacent. For example, in example0, the 6 is at (1,2) which is left of column3. The 2 is at (1,7), which is right of column6. Similarly, 3 at (7,2) and4 at (7,7). So it's like each number is placed in the same row, but mirrored to the opposite side. So for a number in column4 (inside the rectangle's left side), it's moved to column2 (left of the rectangle), and for column5 (right side inside), moved to column7 (right of the rectangle). But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, each number is moved to the left or right of the rectangle, depending on their original position. For example, numbers in the left half of the rectangle are moved to the left side, and right half to the right. Similarly for rows. But example0's 4 is at column4, which is left of center (column4.5). So moved to the left side. But in output, it's at column7, which is right. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, example0's rectangle is from column3 to column6. Column4 is inside the left half. But the output's 4 is at column7, which is outside the right side. So maybe the numbers are moved to the opposite side of the rectangle. For example, numbers on the left half of the rectangle are moved to the right side outside, and vice versa. Similarly for rows. So, a number in the left half (columns3-4.5) are moved to the right of the rectangle (columns7), and numbers in the right half (columns4.5-6) to the left (columns2). \n\nLet's check example0's 4 at column4 (left half) \u2192 moved to column7 (right). 3 at column5 (right half) \u2192 moved to column2 (left). Yes! Similarly, 2 at column4 \u2192 right half, moved to column7? Wait, 2 is at column4, which is left half (columns3-4.5). So moved to column7. But in example0, 2 is moved to column7 (row1). 6 at column5 (right half) \u2192 moved to column2 (left). Yes. \n\nSimilarly, for rows. The rectangle's rows are 2-6. The numbers in the top half (rows2-4) are moved to the bottom of the grid (row7), and those in the bottom half (rows5-6) are moved to the top (row1). \n\nIn example0's 4 and3 are in row3 (top half) \u2192 moved to row7 (bottom). 2 and6 are in row5 (bottom half) \u2192 moved to row1 (top).\n\nIn example1:\n\nOriginal numbers:\n2 at (3,3) \u2192 row3 is top half (rectangle rows2-7, so mid is row4.5?), so moved to row8. Column3 is left half (columns2-4.5), so moved to column8 (right). So 2 is at (8,8) in output. Which matches.\n\n8 is at (3,6) \u2192 row3 (top half) \u2192 row8. Column6 is right half \u2192 column1. So (8,1). But in output, 8 is at (8,1). Yes.\n\n9 at (6,3) \u2192 row6 is bottom half \u2192 row1. Column3 left half \u2192 column8. So (1,8). Yes.\n\n3 at (6,6) \u2192 row6 \u2192 row1. Column6 right half \u2192 column1. So (1,1). Which matches.\n\nExample2:\n\nThe rectangle is rows1-5, columns1-5 (since the input's example2's rectangle is made of 1s from row1 to row5, columns1 to5? Let me check.\n\nExample2 input:\n\nRow1: [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,1,2,0,0,5,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,1,6,0,0,3,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nSo the rectangle is from row1 to row5, columns1 to6 (since row1 has 1s up to column6). So columns1-6.\n\nNumbers inside:\n\n2 at (2,2) \u2192 row2 (top half: rows1-3). So moved to bottom half (rows6-9). Column2: in columns1-6, midpoint is column3.5. Column2 is left half \u2192 moved to right side (columns7-9). So (2,2) \u2192 (6,7). Which matches the output's 2 at (6,7).\n\n5 at (2,5) \u2192 row2 (top) \u2192 bottom. Column5 is right half (columns3.5-6). So moved to left side (columns0-3.5). So (2,5) \u2192 (6,0). But in example2's output, 5 is at (6,0), which is row6, column0. Yes.\n\n6 at (4,2) \u2192 row4 is bottom half (rows3-5) \u2192 moved to top (rows0-2). Column2 is left \u2192 moved to right. So row0, column7. Which matches output's 6 at (0,7).\n\n3 at (4,5) \u2192 row4 (bottom) \u2192 top. Column5 (right) \u2192 left. So row0, column0. But in output, 3 is at (0,0). Yes.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each number inside the rectangle:\n\n- If the row is in the top half of the rectangle, move it to the bottom edge of the grid. If in the bottom half, move to the top edge.\n\n- If the column is in the left half of the rectangle, move to the right edge of the grid. If in the right half, move to the left edge.\n\nBut how exactly are the top and bottom halves determined, and left and right halves?\n\nFor rows:\n\nThe rectangle's vertical midpoint is (start_row + end_row)/2. Any row <= midpoint \u2192 top half, else bottom half. So if the rectangle has an odd number of rows, the middle row is considered part of the top or bottom based on which half it's in.\n\nFor example, in example0's rectangle (rows2-6 \u2192 5 rows), midpoint is row4. So rows2-4 are top half, rows5-6 are bottom half. So a number in row3 (top half) moves to bottom edge (row7). A number in row5 (bottom half) moves to top edge (row1).\n\nFor columns:\n\nMidpoint of the rectangle's columns is (start_col + end_col)/2. Columns left of or equal to midpoint \u2192 left half, moved to right edge. Columns right of midpoint \u2192 right half, moved to left edge.\n\nIn example0's rectangle columns3-6 (4 columns), midpoint between 3 and6 is 4.5. Columns3-4 are left half (since 3 and4 <=4.5), columns5-6 are right half. So a number in column4 (left half) \u2192 moved to right edge (column7). Column5 (right half) \u2192 moved to left edge (column2).\n\nBut how are the new positions determined exactly?\n\nFor rows:\n\nIf a number is in the top half of the rectangle, it's placed in the bottommost possible row (row9) minus the distance from the top of the rectangle. For example, example0's row3 (distance from top row2 is 1), so placed at row9 -1 =8. But example0's 4 is placed at row7. So maybe not. Alternatively, the number's row in the rectangle's top half is mapped to the bottom edge starting from row7 (example0's output), row8 (example1), row6 (example2).\n\nAlternatively, the new row is determined by whether it's top or bottom half. For top half, new row is the bottom edge of the grid (row9) minus (rectangle's start_row - original_row). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the new row for numbers in the top half is the first row below the rectangle, plus the distance from the rectangle's top. For example, in example0's rectangle ends at row6. The next row is7. Numbers in top half (row3) are 3-2=1 row from the top. So placed at row7 +1 =8? But example0's 4 is at row7. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's instead look for a general rule based on the examples.\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n\n- Identify the rectangle (bordered by a number like 8,7,1,3 in the examples). The inner numbers (non-border) are the ones to be moved.\n\n- For each such number inside the rectangle:\n\n   - If it's in the top half of the rectangle's rows, move it to the bottom edge (rows7 or8) in the same relative column position mirrored.\n\n   - If it's in the bottom half, move it to the top edge (rows1 or0).\n\n   - For columns: if it's in the left half of the rectangle's columns, move it to the right edge (columns7,8,9). If in the right half, move to the left edge (columns0,1,2).\n\nThe exact mapping seems to vary based on the rectangle's size. For example, in example0's rectangle columns3-6 (4 columns), the left half is columns3-4, right half 5-6. So moving left half to right edge (column7), right half to column2.\n\nSimilarly, in example1's rectangle columns2-7 (6 columns), midpoint at 4.5. Left half columns2-4 \u2192 moved to column8,9. Right half 5-7 \u2192 moved to column1,0. But in example1's output, 2 is at column8, which is right edge. 8 at column1. So maybe left half \u2192 right edge (column8), right half \u2192 left edge (column1).\n\nSo the general steps could be:\n\n1. Identify the rectangle (the largest contiguous block of a number other than 0, like 8,7,1,3 in examples).\n\n2. For each cell inside the rectangle (not on the border), collect the numbers.\n\n3. For each such number:\n\n   a. Determine if it's in the top or bottom half of the rectangle's rows. Top half moves to the bottom edge, bottom half to the top.\n\n   b. Determine if it's in the left or right half of the rectangle's columns. Left half moves to the right edge, right half to the left.\n\n4. Place the number in the corresponding edge row and column, possibly at specific positions like mirrored.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nThe input grid is:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0]\nRow4: [0,0,3,6,0,0,4,3,0,0]\nRow5: [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]\nRow6: [0,0,3,8,0,0,2,3,0,0]\nRow7: [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0]\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe rectangle here is made of 3s. Let's find the boundaries:\n\nLooking at the rows, the rectangle starts at row3 (all 3s) and ends at row7. Columns: starts at column2 (row3 has 3s from column2 to7). So the rectangle is rows3-7, columns2-7. Wait, row3's columns2-7 are 3s, row4's columns2 and7 are 3s, etc. Wait, no: row3 is [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0], columns2-7. Row4: [0,0,3,6,0,0,4,3,0,0] \u2192 columns2 and7 are 3. The rest of the rows (5,6,7) also have 3s in columns2 and7. So the rectangle is a sort of frame. Wait, no. Looking at the input, the rectangle is probably a hollow frame. For example, row3 is all 3s in columns2-7. Row4 has 3s at columns2 and7. Row5 same. Row6 same. Row7 same as row3. So the rectangle is a hollow frame of 3s, forming a rectangle around the inner area. So the inner numbers are those inside this frame. So the inner cells are in rows4-6 and columns3-6.\n\nThe numbers inside this frame are:\n\nRow4: 6 at column3, 4 at column6.\n\nRow6:8 at column3, 2 at column6.\n\nSo the numbers to move are 6,4,8,2.\n\nNow, applying the pattern.\n\nFirst, determine the rectangle's rows and columns:\n\nRows:3-7 (inclusive). Columns:2-7 (inclusive). So the rectangle is 5 rows high (3,4,5,6,7) and 6 columns wide (2-7).\n\nFor each number inside:\n\n6 is at (4,3) \u2192 row4, column3.\n\n4 is at (4,6) \u2192 row4, column6.\n\n8 is at (6,3) \u2192 row6, column3.\n\n2 is at (6,6) \u2192 row6, column6.\n\nNow, determine top/bottom half and left/right half.\n\nRectangle rows:3-7. Midpoint row is (3+7)/2 =5. So rows3-5 are top half, 6-7 are bottom half.\n\nColumns:2-7. Midpoint column is (2+7)/2 =4.5. Columns2-4 are left half, 5-7 are right half.\n\nFor each number:\n\n6 at (4,3):\n\nRow4 is in top half (since 4 <=5). So move to bottom edge (rows8-9). But in examples, the bottom edge was row7 or8. Let's check previous examples. In example1, the rectangle's bottom row was row7, and numbers in top half were moved to row8 (the next row below). For this test input's rectangle, rows3-7. The bottom edge of the grid is row9. So perhaps numbers in top half are moved to rows8 or9.\n\nBut according to example0, the rectangle's bottom row was row6, and numbers in top half (row3) were moved to row7.\n\nHmm, perhaps the bottom edge for top half numbers is the row immediately below the rectangle. The test input's rectangle ends at row7. So the first row below is row8. So numbers in top half (rows3-5) are moved to row8.\n\nSimilarly, numbers in bottom half (rows6-7) are moved to row1 or 0.\n\nColumns:\n\nFor column3: since columns2-4 are left half, the number is in left half. So move to right edge (columns8-9).\n\nBut example0's left half numbers (columns3-4) were moved to column7 (right edge). So maybe the right edge is calculated as (start_col + (number's column - start_col) + something). Alternatively, for left half columns, the new column is start_col + (number's column - start_col) mirrored to the right. \n\nWait, in example0's rectangle columns3-6. For left half (3-4.5), new column is 7 (right edge). So for each column in the left half, new column is end_col +1 + (column - start_col). For example0, end_col is6, so 6+1 + (3-3) =7 \u2192 column7. For column4, 6+1 + (4-3)=7+1=8? But in example0, 4 is at column4 \u2192 moved to column7. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for left half columns, new column is end_col +1 + (original_col - start_col). So for test input's columns2-4.5 (left half):\n\nIf original_col is3, start_col is2, end_col is7.\n\nnew_col =7 +1 + (3-2) =8+1=9? Not sure. Or maybe it's (end_col +1) - (original_col - start_col). For example0: end_col6, original_col3 \u21926+1 -0=7. Which matches example0's 4 at column7.\n\nIn test input's case, end_col is7. So for original_col3:\n\nnew_col =7+1 - (3-2) =8-1=7. So column7.\n\nBut example0's columns3-6, end_col6. For column3, new_col=6+1 -0=7. Which matches.\n\nYes, this formula seems to work. So for left half columns:\n\nnew_col = end_col +1 - (original_col - start_col).\n\nFor right half columns:\n\nnew_col = start_col -1 - (end_col - original_col).\n\nWait, in example0's column5 (right half), end_col6. start_col3.\n\nnew_col=3-1 - (6-5) =2-1=1. But example0's new_col was2. Hmm, not matching. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, for right half columns:\n\noriginal_col - midpoint = (5-4.5)=0.5. So mirrored to the left side: midpoint -0.5=4. So new_col=4. But that's within the rectangle, so maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the right half columns are moved to the left edge. So for each right half column, new_col is start_col -1 - (original_col - midpoint). But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the examples to find the pattern.\n\nExample0's column3 (left half) \u2192 new_col7.\n\nExample0's column4 (left) \u2192 new_col7.\n\nExample0's column5 (right) \u2192 new_col2.\n\nExample0's column6 (right) \u2192 new_col2.\n\nWait, no. In example0, 3 is at column5 \u2192 new_col2. 6 is at column5 \u2192 new_col7. Wait, no. Example0's 3 is at column5 (input row3, column5). Output is at (7,2), column2. So column5 \u2192 column2.\n\nIn example0, the rectangle's columns are3-6. So for left half (3-4.5) and right half (4.5-6). A number in column5 (right half) would be moved to column2. How?\n\nThe distance from the midpoint (4.5) to column5 is 0.5. So mirrored, it's 4.5 -0.5=4 \u2192 column4. But example0's new_col is2. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: For right half columns, new_col = start_col - (original_col - midpoint). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the new column is calculated as:\n\nFor left half columns: new_col = end_col +1 - (original_col - start_col)\n\nFor right half columns: new_col = start_col -1 - (original_col - midpoint)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's test with example0's column5 (right half):\n\nend_col6, start_col3. midpoint4.5.\n\nnew_col =3-1 - (5-4.5)= 2 -0.5=1.5. Not an integer. Doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, new_col = start_col - (original_col - midpoint). For example0, 3 - (5-4.5)=3-0.5=2.5, rounded down to2. Which matches example0's column2.\n\nFor test input's column3 (left half), end_col7, start_col2.\n\nnew_col=7+1 - (3-2) =8-1=7.\n\nFor column6 (right half):\n\nmidpoint4.5. original_col6.\n\nnew_col=start_col -1 - (6-4.5) \u2192 2-1 -1.5=0-1.5=-1.5. Not possible.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's look for a different pattern.\n\nIn example0's column3 (left half) \u2192 new_col7.\n\nColumn3 is the first column of the rectangle (start_col3). Moved to column7 (which is end_col6 +1).\n\nExample1's column3 (start_col2, end_col7). Column3 is left half (midpoint4.5). So new_col=7+1 - (3-2) =8-1=7. But in example1's output, the number at column3 is moved to column8. So perhaps the formula is new_col=end_col + (original_col - start_col) +1? For example0:6 + (3-3) +1=7. For example1's column3:7 + (3-2)+1=7+1+1=9. But example1's output is column8. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the new column is calculated as follows:\n\nFor left half columns:\n\nnew_col = end_col +1 - (original_col - start_col)\n\nFor example0:\n\nend_col6, start_col3.\n\nnew_col=6+1 - (3-3)=7 \u2192 yes.\n\noriginal_col4:6+1 - (4-3)=7-1=6 \u2192 but example0's 4 is at column7. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: For the columns, the left half is moved to the right edge's corresponding position. For example, the first column of the left half is moved to the last column of the grid, the second to the second last, etc.\n\nIn example0's left half columns3-4 (2 columns). The grid has 10 columns (0-9). The right edge columns are9 and8. So column3 \u21929, column4 \u21928. But example0's 4 is at column7. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the left half columns are moved to columns starting from end_col+1. For example0's end_col6. So column3 is moved to7 (6+1), column4 to8. But example0's 4 is at7. So not.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's instead apply the observed patterns to the test input.\n\nTest input's numbers:\n\n6 at (4,3):\n\nRow4 is in the top half (rows3-5), so moves to bottom edge. In example0's case, the bottom edge was row7. In example1's case, the bottom edge was row8. For test input's rectangle, which ends at row7, the bottom edge for top half numbers would be row8.\n\nColumn3 is in the left half (columns2-4.5), so moves to the right edge. Based on example0, the right edge is column7. So (8,7).\n\n4 at (4,6):\n\nRow4 \u2192 top half \u2192 row8.\n\nColumn6 is in the right half (4.5-7). So moves to left edge. In example0, right half columns5-6 moved to column2. So maybe column6 \u2192 column2. So (8,2).\n\n8 at (6,3):\n\nRow6 is in bottom half (rows6-7) \u2192 moves to top edge (row0 or1). Based on example0, bottom half rows moved to row1. So row1.\n\nColumn3 \u2192 left half \u2192 right edge (column7). So (1,7).\n\n2 at (6,6):\n\nRow6 \u2192 bottom half \u2192 row1.\n\nColumn6 \u2192 right half \u2192 left edge. So column2. So (1,2).\n\nNow, looking at the examples:\n\nExample0's output for numbers in top half (row3) are moved to row7. But in example0, the rectangle ends at row6. So row7 is one below. So for test input's rectangle ending at row7, the bottom edge for top half is row8.\n\nSo the numbers 6 and4 (row4, top half) go to row8.\n\nNumbers8 and2 (row6, bottom half) go to row1.\n\nColumns:\n\nFor left half (columns2-4.5), 3 is in column3 \u2192 right edge column7.\n\nFor column6 (right half), moved to column2.\n\nSo:\n\n6 \u2192 (4,3) \u2192 row8, column7 \u2192 value6.\n\n4 \u2192 (4,6) \u2192 row8, column2 \u2192 value4.\n\n8 \u2192 (6,3) \u2192 row1, column7 \u2192 value8.\n\n2 \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 row1, column2 \u2192 value2.\n\nNow, the output grid would have these numbers placed accordingly. The border of 3s remains, but the inner numbers (6,4,8,2) are replaced with 0s, and the numbers are moved to the perimeter.\n\nSo the output should look like:\n\nRow1: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nRow8: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n\nOther rows outside the rectangle (0,2,8,9) are 0s except where the numbers are placed.\n\nBut in example1, the output for top half numbers was row8 and bottom half row1. So the test input's numbers would be placed in row1 and8.\n\nSo the final output grid would be:\n\nRow1: 0s except columns2 and7 with 2 and8.\n\nRow8: 0s except columns2 and7 with4 and6.\n\nOther rows inside the rectangle (rows3-7) have the 3s, but the inner cells (rows4-6, columns3-6) are replaced with 0s.\n\nLet's construct the output step by step.\n\nOriginal test input's rows:\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,3,6,0,0,4,3,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,3,8,0,0,2,3,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0]\n\nIn the output, the inner numbers (6,4,8,2) are replaced with 0s. So rows4 and6 become:\n\nRow4: [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nThe numbers are moved to row1 and8, columns2 and7.\n\nSo the output grid:\n\nRow1: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,6,0,0]\n\nOther rows (0,2,3,4,5,6,7,9) as per changes.\n\nPutting it all together, the output would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (row0)\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0] (row1)\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (row2)\n[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0] (row3)\n[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0] (row4)\n[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0] (row5)\n[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0] (row6)\n[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0] (row7)\n[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0] (row8)\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (row9)\n\nBut checking example0 and1's output structure, the numbers are placed in row1 and7 (example0) and1 and8 (example1). The test input's numbers are placed in row1 and8. So the output structure seems correct.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids based on the training examples provided. Let me start by carefully analyzing each example to spot any similarities or rules.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input has a structure where there's a rectangle made of 8s, and inside that, some numbers like 4, 3, 2, 6. The output seems to take those inner numbers and move them to the borders. For instance, in the input's fourth row, there's 8,4,3,8, which in the output becomes 8,0,0,8. The numbers 4 and 3 are missing here, but looking at the output's first few rows, I notice that in row 1 (0-indexed maybe?), there's 6 and 2 placed near the edges. Similarly, in the seventh row of the output, there's 3 and 4. So maybe the numbers inside the rectangle are moved to the perimeter of the grid, perhaps mirrored or rotated in some way.\n\nIn Example 1's input, there's a larger rectangle of 7s, with numbers 2, 8, 9, 3 inside. The output moves these numbers to the top and bottom edges. For example, 9 appears on the top right in the output's first row, and 2 is in the bottom row. The 3 is in the top left, and 8 is in the bottom left. Wait, in the input, the positions are (row 3, column 5) for 8, and (row 6, column 6) for 3. But in the output, 3 is at row 1, column 1, and 8 is at row 8, column 1. Hmm, maybe the numbers are being moved to the same row but mirrored positions relative to the center? Or maybe they're placed on the outer edges, with their positions determined by their original positions inside the rectangle.\n\nExample 2's input has a rectangle of 1s with numbers 2,5,6,3 inside. The output moves these to the top and bottom rows. For instance, 3 and 5 are in the first and sixth rows. So maybe the numbers inside the rectangle are being moved to the top and bottom edges of the grid, at positions that correspond to their original positions relative to the rectangle.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern might involve taking the numbers that are inside the rectangle (the non-zero border) and moving them to the outermost rows (top and bottom) of the grid, possibly at positions that mirror their original positions within the rectangle. The numbers from the top part of the rectangle go to the top edge, and the bottom part numbers go to the bottom edge. Also, the numbers in the original rectangle are replaced with zeros in the output.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example 0. The input has numbers 8 forming a border. Inside, in row 3 (if rows are 0-indexed), the numbers 4,3. In row 5, 2,6. In the output, these numbers (2,3,4,6) are moved to the second row (which is row 1) and the seventh row (row 6). For instance, 6 is at row 1, column 2, and 2 at row 1, column 7. Then 3 and 4 are at row 6, columns 2 and 7. Wait, maybe the original positions are mirrored. Let's see: in the input, 4 is at (3,4), 3 at (3,5), 2 at (5,4), 6 at (5,5). The output's row 1 has 6 at column 2 and 2 at column 7. Row 6 has 3 at column 2 and 4 at column 7. Hmm, perhaps the original x (column) positions are mapped such that the left side numbers are moved to the top, and the right side to the bottom, or something like that. Alternatively, maybe the numbers from the upper half of the rectangle are moved to the top edge, and the lower half to the bottom edge. For example, in Example 0, the numbers in the top part (row 3) of the rectangle (4,3) are moved to the bottom of the output (row 6). Wait, 4 and 3 in the input's row 3 (which is the middle of the rectangle) end up in row 6 (the seventh row) of the output. Maybe the vertical position is inverted. Like, the original row within the rectangle is mapped to the opposite edge. Let's think of the rectangle's rows as being from top to bottom, and their corresponding positions on the output's top and bottom edges. For example, the first inner row (row 3 in the input) might be mapped to the bottom edge (row 6 in the output), and the lower inner rows (row 5) might be mapped to the top edge (row 1). But in Example 0, row 3 (input) has 4 and 3, which in the output appear in row 6. Row 5 has 2 and 6, which appear in row 1. So perhaps it's flipped vertically. Similarly, in Example 1, the input has 2 in row 3, column 4, which in the output is moved to row 1, column 1. The 8 is in row 3, column 6, which in the output is at row 8, column 8. Wait, maybe the column positions are mirrored. For example, if the rectangle is from column 3 to column 6 (in Example 0's input), then the original columns 4 and 5 (inside) would map to the edges. So column 4 in the input becomes column 2 in the output (left edge), and column 5 becomes column 7 (right edge). So 4 was at (3,4), so column 4 would map to column 2, and row 3 (which is inside the rectangle's rows 2-6) would map to the bottom edge. So (3,4) \u2192 (6,2), which in Example 0's output is 3 at (6,2) and 4 at (6,7). Wait, but 4 was at (3,4) and in the output, row 6 (original row 3), column 7. Hmm, perhaps columns inside the rectangle are mirrored. Let's see, in Example 0's input rectangle, the columns are from 3 to 6 (0-based). So column 3 and 6 are the borders. The inner columns are 4,5. If we mirror those columns, then column 4 would correspond to column 5's mirrored position. Or perhaps the numbers inside the rectangle are moved to the edges, with their positions mirrored relative to the rectangle's center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers inside the rectangle are collected and placed in the outermost rows (first and last rows of the grid?), but in the examples, the outputs have numbers in rows 1 and 7 (like Example 1's output has 3 in row 1, column 1 and 9 in row 1, column 8). Example 0's output has numbers in rows 1 and 6. Example 2's output has 3 in the first row and 5 in the sixth row. So maybe the numbers from the top half of the rectangle go to the top edge, and the bottom half to the bottom edge. For example, in Example 0, the input's 4 and 3 are in row 3 (third row of the rectangle) and 2 and 6 in row 5 (fifth row of the rectangle). If the rectangle's height is 5 rows (from row 2 to row 6 in the input), then the middle row is row 4. So rows above the middle (rows 2 and 3) are top half, rows 5 and 6 are bottom half. Then the numbers in the top half are moved to the top of the grid (like row 1), and the bottom half to the bottom (row 7). Wait in Example 0's output, the 6 and 2 are in row 1, which might correspond to the bottom half of the rectangle, and 3 and 4 in row 6 (which is the seventh row, but in the output, the bottom part is row 7). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with 0-based vs 1-based indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers inside the rectangle (non-border elements) are extracted and then placed in the outermost rows (top and bottom) of the grid, in the order they appear, left to right, top to bottom. For example, in Example 0's input, the inner numbers are 4,3 in row 3, 0,0 in row 4, and 2,6 in row 5. So the numbers are 4,3,0,0,2,6. The output's top row (row 1) has 6 and 2, and the bottom (row 6) has 3 and 4. So maybe the numbers are reversed, with the first numbers going to the bottom and the later to the top. But this is speculative.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: the inner numbers (non-7s) are 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3. Wait, perhaps the exact positions matter. For example, 2 is at (3,3), 8 at (3,6), 9 at (6,3), 3 at (6,6). In the output, 3 is at (1,1), 9 at (1,8), 8 at (8,1), 2 at (8,8). So it looks like the numbers are placed in the corners of the grid. For example, the original position (3,3) in the input (assuming 0-based) is the top-left inner corner, and in the output, that's moved to (1,1) which is top-left. Similarly, (3,6) \u2192 (1,8), (6,3) \u2192 (8,1), (6,6) \u2192 (8,8). So it's taking the inner numbers and placing them at the corners of the grid, but scaled down? Wait, the input's rectangle for Example 1 is from row 2 to row 7 (0-based), columns 2 to 7. So the inner area is rows 3-6, columns 3-6. The four corners of this inner area are (3,3), (3,6), (6,3), (6,6). These correspond to the four numbers 2,8,9,3. In the output, these are placed at the four corners of the grid's edges. For example, 2 was at (3,3) \u2192 output (8,8), 8 at (3,6) \u2192 output (8,1), 9 at (6,3) \u2192 output (1,1), 3 at (6,6) \u2192 output (1,8). Wait, no. The output's first row (row 1) has 3 at column 1 and 9 at column 8. The eighth row (row 8) has 8 at column 1 and 2 at column 8. So perhaps there's a mirroring here. The original positions within the inner rectangle are transformed by mirroring both row and column. For instance, (3,3) in the input (inner rectangle's top-left corner) becomes (8,8) in the output (bottom-right corner). Similarly, (3,6) (top-right inner) becomes (8,1) (bottom-left), (6,3) (bottom-left inner) becomes (1,8) (top-right), and (6,6) (bottom-right inner) becomes (1,1) (top-left). That would explain Example 1's output. So the numbers are mirrored both in row and column. So, the general rule is that each number inside the inner rectangle is moved to a position that is mirrored both vertically and horizontally relative to the center of the grid. Alternatively, mirrored relative to the inner rectangle's boundaries.\n\nLet me check Example 0. The inner rectangle (excluding the border) is rows 3-5 (0-based) and columns 4-5 (since the 8s are from column 3 to 6, so the inner columns are 4 and 5). The numbers inside are in rows 3,4,5. Wait, in Example 0's input, the rectangle is from row 2 to row 6 (rows with 8s), columns 3 to 6. So the inner rows (non-border) are 3,4,5 (rows 3-5), and inner columns 4-5. The numbers inside are:\n\nRow 3: 4,3 (columns 4,5)\nRow 4: 0 (column 4)\nRow 5: 2,6 (columns 4,5)\n\nIn the output, these numbers are placed at:\n\n6 and 2 in row 1, columns 2 and 7.\n\n3 and 4 in row 6, columns 2 and 7.\n\nHmm, so how does that mapping happen? Let's see. The inner rectangle's columns are 4 and 5. So columns 4 and 5 in the input's inner part. The output columns 2 and 7. So column 4 maps to 2 (since 10 columns total, 0-based: 4 is 5th column. 10-4-1=5, but not sure). Maybe the inner columns are 3 to 6 (border 8s), so the inner columns are 4-5. So for columns, 4 and 5 in the input, perhaps in the output they are placed at columns 2 and 7 (which are two positions left and right of the original's border). Wait, the original border for columns is 3 and 6. So perhaps the inner columns (4,5) are mapped to the outside of the border. For example, column 4 (inner left) is mapped to column 2 (left of the border), and column 5 (inner right) mapped to column 7 (right of the border). Similarly for rows. The inner rows (3-5) are between the border rows 2 and 6. So row 3 (top inner) would map to row 1 (top of grid), row 5 (bottom inner) maps to row 7 (bottom of grid). But in Example 0's output, the numbers from row 3 (4,3) are placed in row 6 (which is near the bottom). Hmm, maybe it's the opposite. Maybe the top inner rows are mapped to the bottom of the grid and vice versa. So row 3 (top inner) maps to row 6 (which is row 6 in the output, which is the seventh row). Let's count rows as 0-based. The input's inner rows are 3,4,5. So the first inner row is 3, the middle 4, the last 5. The output's row 1 (second row) has 6 and 2 from row 5. The output's row 6 (seventh row) has 3 and 4 from row 3. So this suggests that the top inner rows are mapped to the bottom of the output and vice versa.\n\nSo for Example 0, the numbers from row 3 (top inner) are placed at row 6, and row 5 (bottom inner) at row 1. Columns: inner columns 4 and 5 (columns 4 and 5 in input) are placed at columns 2 and 7 in output. So column 4 \u2192 2, column 5 \u21927.\n\nBut how does that make sense? Let's see: the original columns in the input's inner part are 4 and 5. The border is at 3 and 6. So 4 is one column to the right of the left border. In the output, column 2 is two columns left of the left border (since the border was column 3). Wait, maybe the numbers are moved to positions outside the original rectangle, mirrored. So for column 4 (inside the left part of the rectangle), it's moved to column 2 (left of the original left border). Column 5 (inside right part) moved to column 7 (right of original right border, which was column 6). Similarly, rows: row 3 (inside top) moved to row 6 (outside the original bottom border row 6?), but wait the original bottom border is row 6. So row 3 \u2192 row 7? No, in Example 0's output, row 6 is the seventh row (0-based). Let me check:\n\nOriginal input's rectangle for Example 0 is from row 2 to row 6 (inclusive). So the inner rows are 3,4,5. The output's row 1 (second row) and row 6 (seventh row). The original inner row 5 (input row 5) is mapped to output row 1, and row 3 (input row 3) to output row 6.\n\nSo this looks like a vertical flip: the top inner row becomes the bottom in the output, and the bottom inner becomes the top. Similarly for columns: left inner column becomes left outside, right inner becomes right outside.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\nFor each number inside the inner rectangle (not on the border):\n\n- The row is mapped to the corresponding position outside the rectangle, mirrored. If the original row is R in the inner part, the mirrored row is (top_border_row - 1 - (R - top_inner_row))? Not sure. Alternatively, the original inner rows are R1, R2, R3. The output rows could be top_border_row - 1 (above the rectangle) and bottom_border_row + 1 (below). But in Example 0, the output rows for the numbers are row 1 and row 6. The original rectangle is from row 2 to 6. So row 2 is the top border. Row 1 is above, row 7 is below. But in Example 0's output, the numbers are in rows 1 and 6. Wait, maybe the numbers from the top half of the inner rectangle are placed above the rectangle, and the bottom half below. For example, if the inner has 3 rows (3,4,5), then rows 3 and 4 are top half, row 5 is bottom. So numbers in top half are placed above the rectangle, bottom half below. But in Example 0, row 3 (top inner) has 4,3 which go to row 6 (which is below the original rectangle, which ends at row 6). That doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the first inner row is placed at the top of the output, and the last inner row at the bottom. For example, in Example 0's inner rows 3,4,5. The first inner row (3) is placed at the bottom of the output (row 6) and the last inner row (5) at the top (row 1). So it's reversed.\n\nPutting this all together, the steps could be:\n\n1. Identify the rectangle's borders (the largest non-zero numbers, like 8 in Example 0, 7 in Example 1, 1 in Example 2). The borders form a rectangle, and the inner area is the part within the borders.\n\n2. For each number inside the inner area (excluding the border itself):\n\n   a. Determine their original position (row, column) within the grid.\n\n   b. Mirror their row position vertically relative to the rectangle's center. For example, the top inner rows are moved to the bottom of the grid, and the bottom inner rows to the top.\n\n   c. Mirror their column position horizontally. For example, left inner columns are moved to the right, and vice versa. Or perhaps moved to the outside of the original rectangle's borders.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, the numbers are moved to the grid's outer edges, mirrored in both row and column. For example, in Example 1, the number 2 was at (3,3) in the input (assuming 0-based), and in the output, it's at (8,8). The grid has 10 rows and columns (0-9). So mirroring 3 would be 9-3-1=5, but that doesn't fit. Wait, 3 mirrored over the center (which is between 4.5) would be 9 - 3 = 6. So (3,3) \u2192 (6,6), but in the output it's (8,8). Hmm, that doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are moved to the same relative position but on the opposite side of the grid. For example, a number in the top-left of the inner rectangle is moved to the bottom-right of the grid. This seems to be the case in Example 1: 2 at (3,3) \u2192 (8,8), which is the bottom-right corner. 8 at (3,6) \u2192 (8,1), bottom-left. 9 at (6,3) \u2192 (1,8), top-right. 3 at (6,6) \u2192 (1,1), top-left. So yes, the row is mirrored (3 becomes 8-3=5? No, 3 to 8. The rows are 0-9. So 3 \u2192 9-3=6. But 8 is row 8. Wait, 3 + (9-3) =9? Not sure. Alternatively, the input's inner rows are from 3-6 (for Example 1's input, the rectangle is rows 2-7, so inner rows 3-6). So the center row is (3+6)/2 = 4.5. So row 3 is 1.5 units above the center, so mirrored to row 6.5 - but since rows are integers, maybe row 3 \u2192 row 6, row 4 \u21925, row5\u21924, row6\u21923. So the row is mirrored around the center of the inner rectangle. Similarly for columns. Then, after mirroring within the inner rectangle, the number is moved to the corresponding position outside the rectangle. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are moved to the grid's edges such that their original position's row and column are subtracted from the grid's maximum index (9 for 0-based 10x10 grid). So for a position (r, c), the mirrored position would be (9 - r, 9 - c). But in Example 1, 2 is at (3,3), which would mirror to (6,6). But in the output, it's at (8,8). Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are placed at (max_row - inner_row, max_col - inner_col). For Example 1's 2 at (3,3), max_row is 9, so 9-3=6. 9-3=6. So (6,6), but the output has it at (8,8). So that's not matching.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 1's output. The number 2 from input's (3,3) is at output's (8,8). 3 from (6,6) is at (1,1). So (3,3) \u2192 (8,8) and (6,6) \u2192 (1,1). The difference is 5 rows and 5 columns. 3 +5 =8, 6 -5=1. So perhaps it's adding the difference between the grid's edge and the inner rectangle's borders. For example, in Example 1, the rectangle's borders are rows 2-7 (0-based), columns 2-7. So the inner rectangle is rows 3-6, columns 3-6. The distance from the top of the grid (row 0) to the top of the inner rectangle (row 3) is 3 rows. So the mirrored position would be 3 rows below the bottom of the inner rectangle. Since the inner rectangle's bottom row is 6, adding 3 rows would take us to row 9. But the output's 2 is at row 8. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are moved to the grid's perimeter, such that their new position's distance from the nearest edge corresponds to their original distance from the rectangle's border. For example, in Example 0's input, the number 4 is at column 4, which is 1 column away from the rectangle's left border (column 3). So in the output, it's placed 1 column away from the grid's left border (column 0), which would be column 1. But in the output, it's at column 7. Hmm, that's the opposite.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's try a different approach. Let's list the positions of the numbers in the input and their corresponding output positions for each example to see if there's a pattern.\n\nExample 0:\nInput numbers inside the rectangle:\n- 4 at (3,4)\n- 3 at (3,5)\n- 0 at (4,4) \u2192 ignored (zero)\n- 0 at (4,5) \u2192 ignored\n- 2 at (5,4)\n- 6 at (5,5)\nOutput positions:\n- 6 at (1,2)\n- 2 at (1,7)\n- 3 at (6,2)\n- 4 at (6,7)\n\nExample 1:\nInput numbers:\n- 2 at (3,3)\n- 8 at (3,6)\n- 9 at (6,3)\n- 3 at (6,6)\nOutput positions:\n- 3 at (1,1)\n- 9 at (1,8)\n- 8 at (8,1)\n- 2 at (8,8)\n\nExample 2:\nInput numbers:\n- 2 at (2,2)\n- 5 at (2,5)\n- 6 at (4,2)\n- 3 at (4,5)\nOutput positions:\n- 3 at (0,0)\n- 5 at (0,5)\n- 2 at (6,7)\n- 6 at (6,1)\n\nWait, the output for Example 2 has 3 in row 0, column 0. 5 in row 0, column 5. 6 in row 6, column 1. 2 in row 6, column7.\n\nHmm, looking at Example 2's input, the rectangle is rows 1-5, columns 1-5 (1-based?), with numbers inside:\n\nRow 2 (input's row 2), columns 2 and 5: 2 and 5.\nRow 4 (input's row 4), columns 2 and 5:6 and3.\n\nIn the output, 3 is at (0,0), 5 at (0,5), 2 at (6,7), 6 at (6,1).\n\nSo for Example 2, the original positions (2,2) \u2192 (6,7), (2,5) \u2192 (0,5), (4,2) \u2192 (6,1), (4,5) \u2192 (0,0).\n\nThis seems like a vertical mirroring but not horizontal. For instance, row 2 in input (which is the third row 0-based) is mapped to row 6 (seventh row). Row 4 (fifth row) is mapped to row 0. Wait, 0-based rows, input row 2 \u2192 output row 6. Input row 4 \u2192 output row 0. That's a vertical mirroring with a certain offset.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original row within the inner rectangle is subtracted from the total rows minus 1. For example, in Example 0's input, the inner rows are 3-5 (rows 3,4,5). The output rows for the numbers are 1 and 6. Let's compute 9 -3 =6, 9-5=4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for Example 0, the inner rectangle is rows 2-6 (border rows), so inner rows 3-5. The output rows are 1 and 6. So perhaps the numbers from the first inner row (3) are placed at row 6, and the last inner row (5) at row 1. So it's reversed.\n\nIn Example 1, the inner rows are 3-6. The numbers are in rows 3 and 6. In output, they're in rows 1 and 8. So row 3 (input) \u2192 8 (output) and 6 \u21921. So 3 becomes 8 (9-3=6, but 8 is 9-1?), not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are placed at a distance from the grid's edge equal to their distance from the inner rectangle's border. For example, a number that is k rows from the top of the inner rectangle is placed k rows from the top of the grid. But in Example 0's input, 4 is in row 3, which is the first inner row (distance 0 from the top of the inner rectangle). If placed 0 rows from the grid's top, that's row 0. But in output, it's at row 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the movement in terms of layers. The input's rectangle is a certain layer (like a square) with a border. The output takes the numbers inside that layer and moves them to the outer edges of the grid, possibly in a mirrored fashion.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has the same border structure as the input. For example, the 8s in Example 0 remain in the same positions. Only the inner numbers are replaced with zeros, and the original inner numbers are moved to the edges. So the first step of the transformation is to remove the inner numbers from their positions (replace with 0) and place them elsewhere.\n\nThe numbers are moved to the top and bottom edges of the grid. The positions seem to be determined by their original positions relative to the rectangle. For example, numbers in the upper part of the rectangle are placed on the top edge, lower part on the bottom edge, and their column positions are mirrored.\n\nLooking at Example 0 again:\n\nInput inner numbers:\n\nRow 3: 4 (col4), 3 (col5)\n\nRow 5: 2 (col4), 6 (col5)\n\nOutput:\n\nRow 1 (second row): 6 (col2), 2 (col7)\n\nRow 6 (seventh row):3 (col2),4 (col7)\n\nSo col4 and 5 in the input are mapped to col2 and 7. Column4 is one position inside the left border (col3). Col2 is two positions to the left of the left border. Similarly, col5 is one inside the right border (col6), col7 is one position to the right of the right border. So perhaps the displacement is by 2 positions from the original's inner position. For example, col4 \u2192 col3-1 (since col3 is the border) \u2192 col2. Col5 \u2192 col6 +1 \u2192 col7. So the columns are moved to the outside by 1 position beyond the border. \n\nFor rows:\n\nRow3 is two rows inside the top border (row2). So displacement could be row2 -1 \u2192 row1. But row3 is mapped to row6 in the output. Hmm. Maybe it's based on the inner row's distance from the top. Row3 is the first inner row (distance 1 from top border). So it's placed at the top border's row minus 1 (row2-1=row1), but in the output, it's row6. That doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the number of rows from the top of the inner rectangle to the number's row determines how far from the grid's edge they are placed. For example, in Example 0's input, the inner rows are 3,4,5. The top of the inner rectangle is row3. The number 4 is in row3 (distance 0 from top of inner), so placed at the bottom of the grid (row9) minus 0 \u2192 row9. But in output, it's row6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, considering the entire grid as having layers. The original rectangle is one layer. The numbers are moved to the next outer layer. So the numbers inside the rectangle are moved outward, but this doesn't explain the positions in the examples.\n\nAnother approach: For each example, the numbers in the input are placed in the output's first and penultimate rows, mirrored in their x positions. For example, in Example 0, the numbers 6 and 2 are in row1, columns2 and7. The original columns4 and5 \u2192 columns2 and7. The difference is that columns4 and5 are at positions 4 and5 (0-based). The output columns are 2 and7. 4-2=2, 7-5=2. So each original column is moved left by 2 for the left side and right by 2 for the right side. But this is inconsistent with other examples.\n\nExample1: Original columns3,6 \u2192 output columns1,8. Original columns3 and6 in the input's inner are columns3 and6. Output columns1 and8. 3-1=2, 8-6=2. So same pattern: moved left by 2 and right by 2. Yes. Example2's input inner columns2 and5 \u2192 output columns0 and5 (for 3 and5 in row0) and1 and7 (for 6 and2 in row6). For 5 in column5 \u21925 \u21925 in output. Column2 \u21920 (difference of 2). Column2 \u21921 in output? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the columns are mirrored around the center of the grid. For a 10-column grid, the center is between columns4 and5. So column3 would mirror to column6 (since 4.5 is the center; 3's mirror is 6.5-3=3.5? Not sure. But in Example0, columns4 and5. Their mirrors would be columns5 and4, but output columns2 and7. Not matching.\n\nThis is taking a while. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's consider that the output is created by taking the numbers inside the rectangle and placing them in the first and last rows of the grid, and in the columns that are symmetric relative to the rectangle's columns.\n\nFor Example0's input:\n\nNumbers 4,3,2,6 are inside. The output places 6 and2 in row1 (columns2 and7), and 3 and4 in row6 (columns2 and7). Columns2 and7 are symmetric around the rectangle's columns (3-6). The center of the rectangle's columns is (3+6)/2=4.5. Columns2 and7 are 4.5 -2.5 and 4.5 +2.5. So they are symmetrically placed around the rectangle's center. Similarly, rows1 and6 are symmetric around the rectangle's row center ( (2+6)/2=4. So row1 is 3 rows above center, row6 is 2 rows below. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are placed in the same row but mirrored columns. For example, in Example0, row3's numbers (4,3) are placed in row6's columns2 and7. Row5's numbers (2,6) are placed in row1's columns2 and7. So rows are mirrored (3\u21926, 5\u21921) and columns mirrored (4\u21922,5\u21927). So how are 3\u21926? 3+3=6. 5-4=1. Wait, row3 to row6 is a difference of 3, row5 to row1 is a difference of -4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, row numbers are transformed as follows: for Example0, the original rows are 3 and5. Output rows are6 and1. The sum of 3+5=8, and 6+1=7. Not helpful.\n\nPerhaps there's a pattern where the numbers from the top half of the inner rectangle are moved to the bottom of the grid, and the bottom half to the top. Similarly, left columns to the right and right to the left.\n\nFor Example0's inner rectangle rows3-5:\n\n- row3 (top) \u2192 bottom (row6)\n\n- row5 (bottom) \u2192 top (row1)\n\nColumns:\n\n- column4 (left) \u2192 column2 (left of the border)\n\n- column5 (right) \u2192 column7 (right of the border)\n\nSo in Example0's case, moving row3 to row6 (which is one row below the original rectangle's bottom row (row6 is the border's row). Similarly, row5 is moved to row1 (which is one row above the original rectangle's top row (row2)).\n\nIn Example1's case:\n\nOriginal inner rows3-6 (for a 4-row inner area). The numbers are in rows3 and6. So row3 (top) \u2192 row8 (bottom of grid), row6 (bottom) \u2192 row1 (top of grid).\n\nColumns3 and6 (inner columns) \u2192 columns1 and8 (outside the original border columns2 and7).\n\nSo the rule seems to be:\n\nFor each number inside the inner rectangle:\n\n- The row is moved to the opposite side of the grid relative to the inner rectangle. So if the number is in the top part of the inner rectangle, it's moved to the bottom of the grid; if in the bottom part, moved to the top.\n\n- The column is moved to the opposite side of the grid relative to the inner rectangle. So if the number is in the left part of the inner rectangle, it's moved to the right edge; if in the right part, moved to the left edge.\n\nBut how to determine the exact positions?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are placed at positions that are mirrored relative to the inner rectangle's center.\n\nLet's calculate the center of the inner rectangle for Example0:\n\nRows: 3-5 (inclusive). Center row is (3+5)/2=4.\n\nColumns:4-5 (inclusive). Center column is 4.5.\n\nA number at (3,4) would have a mirrored position at (5,5) (since 3 is 1 row above center, so 4+1=5. Column4 is 0.5 left of center, so mirrored to 4.5 +0.5=5). But in the output, it's placed at (6,2). Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are mirrored across the grid's center. For a 10x10 grid, the center is between (4.5,4.5). So a point (r,c) would be mirrored to (9-r, 9-c). For Example0's (3,4), this would be (6,5). But in the output, it's (6,2). Doesn't match.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to see if there's a simpler pattern. In all examples, the output has the same border structure as the input. The numbers inside are moved to the top and bottom rows, and their positions are mirrored left-right. For example, in Example0, 6 and2 are in row1, columns2 and7. 3 and4 are in row6, columns2 and7. So the columns are symmetric around the center (columns4.5). 2 and7 are equidistant from 4.5 (distance 2.5). Similarly, in Example1, 3 and9 are in columns1 and8, which are symmetric. 8 and2 are in columns1 and8.\n\nSo perhaps the columns are mirrored left-right. For example, a number originally in column x is placed in column (9 - x) + some offset. Or perhaps the original column within the inner rectangle is mirrored to the outer columns.\n\nIn Example0's input, the inner columns are4 and5. For column4, the mirrored position could be column5 (since 4 and5 are center columns), but in the output, it's column2 and7. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are placed in the columns that are two positions outside the original rectangle's borders. For Example0's original columns3-6, the borders are columns3 and6. So two positions outside would be columns1 and8. But the output uses columns2 and7, which are one position outside.\n\nWait, Example0's input has columns3-6 as the border. Columns4 and5 are inside. The output places the numbers at columns2 and7. Which are one position outside the borders (3-1=2,6+1=7). So for columns, the numbers are placed one position outside the original rectangle's columns. For rows, perhaps similarly. The original rectangle's rows are2-6. So top border is row2, bottom row6. The output's row1 is one above row2, and row7 is one below row6. But in Example0's output, the numbers are in rows1 and6. Row6 is the original bottom border row. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are placed in the first and last rows that are completely outside the original rectangle. For Example0's input, the original rectangle is rows2-6. The first row above is row1, and the first row below is row7. So numbers from the inner top are placed in row1, inner bottom in row7. But in Example0's output, the numbers from row3 (inner top) are in row6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Let me try to find another approach. Maybe the numbers are moved to the corners of the grid. For example, in Example1, the numbers are placed in the four corners. In Example0, the numbers are placed in the top and bottom edges, but not the corners. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are placed in the same relative position but outside the rectangle. For example, in Example0, the numbers were in columns4 and5 (center of the rectangle). When moved outside, they are placed in columns2 and7 (which are two columns left and right of the original borders columns3 and6). So 4-3=1, so moved left by 2 (3-2=1?), but not sure.\n\nWait, 4-3=1 (distance from the left border). So moved left by 2 (3-2=1?), not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the displacement is the same as the distance from the inner column to the border. For example, column4 is 1 unit away from the left border (column3). So the number is placed 1 unit to the left of the left border (3-1=2). Similarly, column5 is 1 unit away from the right border (column6), so placed 1 unit to the right (6+1=7). So for columns, the displacement is the same as the distance from the border. For rows, perhaps similarly.\n\nIn Example0's row3: distance from top border (row2) is 1. So placed 1 unit above the top border (row2-1=row1). But in the output, it's placed in row6, which is the original bottom border row (6) plus 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for rows: the distance from the inner row to the top border is 1 (row3 - row2=1). So placed 1 unit below the bottom border (row6 +1=row7). But in the output, the number is in row6. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to apply the pattern to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 6, 0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe rectangle here is made of 3s. The borders are rows3-7 (0-based), columns2-7. So inner rows are4-6, columns3-6.\n\nThe numbers inside are:\n\nRow4 (4th row):6 at (4,3), 4 at (4,6)\n\nRow6 (6th row):8 at (6,3), 2 at (6,6)\n\nRow5 (5th row):0s, so ignored.\n\nSo the numbers to move are 6,4,8,2.\n\nFollowing the pattern from the examples, these numbers should be placed in the top and bottom edges of the grid, mirrored columns.\n\nIn Example1, the numbers were placed at the corners. For example, 6 and4 are in row4 (inner row), columns3 and6. These could be placed in the top and bottom rows, mirrored.\n\nLooking at Example1's pattern, the numbers were moved to (row1, col1), (row1, col8), (row8, col1), (row8, col8). For the test input, the numbers 6,4,8,2 are in columns3 and6. So perhaps:\n\n6 at (4,3) \u2192 top row (row0 or1) at column (mirror of3). But in Example1, the inner column3 was mirrored to column1. So 3 \u21921. How? For columns2-7 in the border, the inner columns are3-6. So column3 is 1 unit from the left border (column2). So mirrored to 1 unit left of the left border (column2-1=1). Similarly, column6 is 1 unit from the right border (column7), mirrored to column7+1=8.\n\nSo in the test input, 6 is at column3 (inner left) \u2192 mirrored to column1. 4 is at column6 (inner right) \u2192 mirrored to column8. 8 is at column3 \u2192 column1. 2 is at column6 \u2192 column8.\n\nFor rows: the inner rows are4-6. So row4 is 4-3=1 (distance from top border row3). So placed 1 unit above the top border \u2192 row3-1=2. But in Example1, row3 (inner top) was placed at row1. Hmm. Alternatively, the distance from the top of the inner rectangle (row3) to the number's row. For row4, distance is 1 (4-3). So placed 1 row above the top border \u2192 row3-1=2. But in Example1, the number at row3 (distance0) was placed at row1 (row3-2=1). So maybe the displacement is distance +1. So row4 (distance1) \u2192 row3-1-1=1. Wait, this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the row placement is similar to Example1. The numbers in the inner rows are placed in the top and bottom rows of the grid. The top inner rows are placed in the bottom of the grid and vice versa.\n\nFor example, in the test input:\n\nNumbers in row4 (inner row) \u2192 top half of inner rectangle? The inner rows are4-6. So row4 is the top, row5 middle, row6 bottom. So numbers in row4 (top) \u2192 bottom of the grid (row8 or9). Numbers in row6 (bottom) \u2192 top of the grid (row0 or1).\n\nBut in Example1, the inner rows were3-6. The numbers in row3 (top) were placed at row8 (bottom), row6 (bottom) at row1 (top). So for test input:\n\n6 and4 in row4 \u2192 maybe placed in row8.\n\n8 and2 in row6 \u2192 placed in row1.\n\nBut how to determine the exact rows.\n\nAlternatively, the row displacement is calculated as (original row - top border row) +1. For example, in Example1, row3 is top border row3 of the inner rectangle. The displacement to top of grid would be (3-3) +1=1 \u2192 row1. For test input:\n\nrow4 (top border of inner is row3?), so (4-3) +1=2 \u2192 row2. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number's row within the inner rectangle (0-based) is used. For Example1's inner rows3-6 (4 rows), row3 is 0, row6 is3. So row0 is placed at row8, row3 at row1. So (inner row index) \u2192 (grid rows -1 - inner row index). For Example1: inner row0 \u21928, inner row3\u21921. So for test input's inner rows4-6 (3 rows, indices0-2):\n\n6 and4 are in row0 (4-4=0), so placed at row8-0=8.\n\n8 and2 are in row2 (6-4=2), placed at row8-2=6.\n\nBut in the output, perhaps they are placed in the top and bottom rows.\n\nWait, perhaps the row placement is determined by mirroring the inner row index. For a grid with 10 rows (0-9), the inner rows are4-6 (indices0-2). The mirrored row would be 9 - original_row. But this would place row4 (original_row4) \u21929-4=5. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, for the test input, the numbers in row4 (inner row0) are placed at row8, and row6 (inner row2) at row1. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet's try applying this to the test input:\n\nNumbers to move:6,4,8,2.\n\nColumns:\n\n- 6 at column3 \u2192 mirrored to column1.\n\n-4 at column6 \u2192 mirrored to column8.\n\n-8 at column3 \u2192 mirrored to column1.\n\n-2 at column6 \u2192 mirrored to column8.\n\nRows:\n\n-6 and4 in row4 (inner row0) \u2192 placed at row8.\n\n-8 and2 in row6 (inner row2) \u2192 placed at row1.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nIn row1 (second row), columns1 and8:8 and2.\n\nIn row8 (ninth row), columns1 and8:6 and4.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the output usually has two rows with numbers: top and bottom. For example, Example0 has row1 and row6. Example1 has row1 and row8. Example2 has row0 and row6.\n\nIn the test input's case, following Example1's pattern, the numbers would be placed in rows1 and8.\n\nSo the output might look like:\n\nRow1: 0,8,0,0,...0,2,0\n\nRow8:0,6,0,0,...0,4,0\n\nBut the exact placement depends on how the rows are mapped.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers from the top inner rows are placed at the bottom of the grid and vice versa. So for row4 (which is the first inner row) \u2192 placed at row8. Row6 (last inner row) \u2192 placed at row1.\n\nSo the output for the test input would have:\n\nIn row1:8 and2 at columns1 and8.\n\nIn row8:6 and4 at columns1 and8.\n\nOther rows would have the same 3s borders, and the inner 3s replaced with zeros.\n\nBut wait, the original input's inner numbers are at rows4 and6. So for the output, the numbers from row4 (6 and4) go to row8, and numbers from row6 (8 and2) go to row1.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nRow1: ... 8 at column3? Wait, no. According to the previous column mapping, 8 is in column3 in the input, which maps to column1 in the output. So row1 would have 8 at column1 and2 at column8.\n\nRow8 would have6 at column1 and4 at column8.\n\nSo the first row (index0) would be zeros. Row1 (index1) would have 0,8,0,...0,2,0.\n\nRow8 (index8) would have 0,6,0,...0,4,0.\n\nOther rows would have the 3s borders, with inner numbers replaced by zeros.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // row0\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]  // row1\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]  // row8\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut wait, the original borders are in rows3-7 (0-based). So rows3-7 have 3s. The output should have the same borders, with inner numbers (6,4,8,2) replaced by zeros. So the output would have the 3s borders, and the numbers moved to rows1 and8, columns1 and8.\n\nThis matches the pattern seen in Example1, where numbers were moved to the corners of the grid. So the test input's output would have 8 and2 in row1, columns1 and8, and6 and4 in row8, columns1 and8.",
