        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a grid of numbers, mostly 0s and 3s, and the output grids have some 3s replaced with 4s. My task is to find out under what conditions a 3 in the input becomes a 4 in the output.\n\nFirst, let's look at Example 0. The input has a diamond-like structure of 3s. The output replaces the center 3s with 4s. In the middle of the diamond, the 3 at position (2,2) (assuming rows and columns start at 0) becomes a 4. Similarly, in the next row, the 3s in the middle of the diamond structure also become 4s. So maybe the 4s are placed where a 3 is surrounded by other 3s in certain positions.\n\nWait, but how exactly? Let's check another example. In Example 1's output, the 4 appears in row 4, column 6. Looking at the input, that position was a 0. Wait, no\u2014wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the fifth row (index 4) has [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]. The output changes the 0 at position (4,6) to a 4. Hmm, that's strange. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up rows and columns. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the input for Example 1's fifth row (index 4) is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]. The output for that row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 0, 0]. So the 0 at position (4,6) becomes a 4. But how? That was a 0. So maybe the 4 is placed where a cell is adjacent to certain configurations of 3s. Or perhaps the 4s are replacing 3s that are part of certain patterns.\n\nWait, but in all the training examples, the outputs only have 4s where there were 3s in the input. Wait, looking again: Example 0's input has 3s arranged in a diamond. The output changes the central 3s to 4s. So maybe when a 3 is part of a cross or has four diagonal neighbors?\n\nWait, let's think about the positions. For instance, in Example 0's input:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,3,0,3,0,0]\nRow 3: [0,0,3,0,3,0]\n\nIn the output, row 2 becomes [0,3,4,3,0,0], and row 3 becomes [0,0,3,4,3,0]. So the 4s are at positions where the cell is a 3 in the input and is flanked by 3s diagonally. For example, the cell (2,2) in the input is 3. Its four diagonal neighbors (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) would be positions (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3). In the input, (1,1) is 0, (1,3) is 0, (3,1) is 0, (3,3) is 0. Wait, that doesn't make sense. So maybe not diagonal neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell is a 3 and is adjacent (orthogonally) to exactly two 3s. Let's check. In Example 0, the cell (2,2) is a 3. Its neighbors above, below, left, right: above is (1,2) which is 3, below is (3,2) which is 3, left is (2,1) which is 3, right is (2,3) which is 3. Wait, but that's four neighbors. But in the input, the cell (2,2) is 0 in the input. Wait no, wait in the input for Example 0, row 2 is [0,3,0,3,0,0]. Wait, wait no\u2014wait the input for Example 0's row 2 is [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]. So cell (2,2) is 0. Wait, but the output row 2 is [0,3,4,3,0,0]. Wait, that's confusing. Oh no, wait I'm getting the input and output mixed up. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,3,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,3,0,3,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow 5: all 0s.\n\nThe output for row 2 becomes [0,3,4,3,0,0]. So the input cell (2,2) was 0, but the output is 4. That's impossible. Wait, no\u2014the input's row 2 is [0,3,0,3,0,0]. So in the input, cell (row 2, column 2) is 0, but in the output it's 4. That's a problem. But according to the examples, the output only changes some 3s to 4s. Wait, this suggests that maybe I'm misunderstanding the input structure. Maybe the input and output are grids where 0s can become 4s? But the examples show that the 4s are only introduced where there were 3s. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input row 2: [0,3,0,3,0,0]. The output row 2: [0,3,4,3,0,0]. So the cell that was 0 in the input becomes 4 in the output. But that contradicts the initial assumption. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe the transformation isn't just modifying existing 3s. Maybe it's adding 4s in certain positions, possibly where a cell is surrounded by 3s in some way.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that a cell becomes 4 if it is a 0 in the input and has exactly two or three adjacent 3s. But let's check. In Example 0's cell (2,2) which is 0 in input, how many adjacent 3s does it have? Let's see: up is row 1, column 2: 3. Down is row 3, column 2:3. Left is row 2, column 1:3. Right is row 2, column 3:3. So four adjacent 3s. So if the rule is that a 0 becomes 4 if it has four 3 neighbors, maybe. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 4 is at (4,6) in row 4 (0-based). The input for that cell was 0. Let's check the neighbors. The cell (4,6) in input was 0. Let's check adjacent cells:\n\nUp: row 3, column 6: 3 (from input row 3: [0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0] \u2192 column 6 is 3).\n\nDown: row 5, column 6: 3 (input row 5: [0,0,0,3,0,3,3,0,0,0] \u2192 column 6 is 3).\n\nLeft: row 4, column 5: 3 (input row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0] \u2192 column 5 is 3).\n\nRight: row 4, column 7:3 (input row 4: column 7 is 3).\n\nSo four adjacent 3s. So again, the cell is 0 with four 3 neighbors, becomes 4. So perhaps the rule is: a cell becomes 4 if it is 0 and has exactly four orthogonally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) that are 3s. But wait in Example 0's cell (2,2), the cell was 0 and had four 3s around it (up, down, left, right), so it becomes 4.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, cell (4,6) is 0 in input and has four 3s (up, down, left, right) \u2192 becomes 4.\n\nLet me check another example. Example 2's input has a 3 at row 3, column 4. The output changes some cells to 4s, like in row 3, columns 4 and 5. Let's check cell (3,4) in input. Input row 3 is [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0]. So cell (3,4) is 0. In the output, it becomes 4. Let's check its neighbors. Up: row 2, column 4:3 (input row 2: [0,3,3,0,3,3,0,3,0,0], column 4 is 3). Down: row4, column4:3 (input row4: [0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,0,0] \u2192 column4 is 0. Wait, that's conflicting. So perhaps the rule isn't based on orthogonal neighbors. Alternatively, maybe diagonal neighbors?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the cell being surrounded by 3s in a certain pattern, perhaps forming a cross. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in Example 3's output, there are 4s in a block. The input row 2: [0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0], output row 2 becomes [0,0,3,4,4,3,0,0,0,0]. So the 0s at columns 3 and 4 become 4s. Let's check their neighbors. For cell (2,3) in input (0), the orthogonal neighbors: up row1: [0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0], column3 is 3. Down row3: [0,0,3,0,0,3,0,3,0,0], column3 is0. Left: row2, column2:3. Right: row2, column4:0. So neighbors: up (3), down (0), left (3), right (0). So two 3s. But the cell becomes 4. So that contradicts the previous idea of four 3s.\n\nHmm. So maybe the pattern isn't based on orthogonal neighbors. Let's consider another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the 4s often form a cross or a diamond shape. For instance, in Example 0, the 4s form the center of the diamond. In Example 1, the 4 is at the center of a cross of 3s. Example 3 has 4s in a square pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 4s are placed where a 0 cell is surrounded by exactly two 3s in orthogonal directions and two 3s in diagonal directions, forming a plus shape. But I need to find a consistent rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are placed where a cell is part of a 2x2 square of 3s. But looking at Example 3's output, the 4s are in a 2x2 block. But in the input, those were 0s. So maybe when a 2x2 area is surrounded by 3s, the 0s become 4s. For example, in Example 3's input row2 and row3, columns3-4 are 0s. In the output, they become 4s. Let me check the surrounding cells. For the 2x2 block in row2-3, columns3-4:\n\nInput row2: [0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns3 is 0, column4 is0.\n\nInput row3: [0,0,3,0,0,3,0,3,0,0] \u2192 columns3 is0, column4 is0.\n\nSo the 2x2 block of 0s. The cells around them: left column2 has 3s, right column5 has 3s (from row2, column5 is3). Maybe the 2x2 block is surrounded by 3s on all four sides. Let's see:\n\nLeft: column2 has 3s in rows2 and3.\n\nRight: column5 has 3s in rows2 and3 (input row2, column5 is3; row3, column5 is0. Wait, row3, column5 is0. So maybe not. Hmm. This approach might not work.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the 4s are placed in cells that are part of a \"cross\" of 3s. For example, in Example 0, the 4 is where a vertical and horizontal line of 3s intersect. Let's check. In Example 0's input, the vertical line is column2 with 3s in rows1,2,3. The horizontal line is row2, columns1,2,3. The intersection is cell (2,2), which was 0 in input and becomes 4. So maybe when a 0 is at the intersection of a vertical and horizontal line of 3s, it becomes 4.\n\nLet me test this with other examples. In Example 1's output, the 4 is at row4, column6. The input at that position is 0. Let's check if there's a vertical line (column6) with 3s and a horizontal line (row4) with 3s.\n\nInput column6 in row3 is3, row4 is0, row5 is3. So column6 has 3s in rows3 and5 but not 4. The horizontal line row4 has 3s in columns5 and7. So maybe not a full line, but perhaps the cell has 3s on both left and right, and above and below. For example, if cell (4,6) has 3s to the left and right in the same row, and 3s above and below in the same column. In the input row4: [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0], so left is column5 (3), right is column7 (3). Column6: row3 is3, row5 is3. So cell (4,6) has 3s above (row3), below (row5), left (column5), and right (column7). So it's surrounded by 3s in all four directions, but diagonally? Or orthogonally? Wait, no. Orthogonally, the cell (4,6) has up (row3,6) is3, down (row5,6) is3, left (row4,5) is3, right (row4,7) is3. So four orthogonal neighbors are 3s. But the cell itself is 0. So the rule could be: if a cell is 0 and has 3s in all four orthogonal directions (up, down, left, right), then it becomes 4.\n\nBut wait in Example 0's cell (2,2), the orthogonal neighbors are up (row1,2) is3, down (row3,2) is3, left (row2,1) is3, right (row2,3) is3. So four 3s around. So according to this rule, it should become 4, which it does. Similarly, Example 1's cell (4,6) is 0 and has four 3s in orthogonal directions, becomes 4. Example 3's output has 4s in a block where each cell in that block is surrounded by 3s on all four sides. Wait, let's check Example 3's input. The 4s in the output are in row2, columns3-4 and row3, columns3-4. Let's take cell (2,3): input is0. Its orthogonal neighbors: up row1, column3 is3 (input row1 is [0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0], column3 is3). Down row3, column3 is0. Left row2, column2 is3. Right row2, column4 is0. So orthogonal neighbors are up:3, down:0, left:3, right:0. Only two 3s. So this contradicts the earlier rule. So perhaps the rule isn't exactly four orthogonal 3s.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's consider another approach. Maybe the 4s are placed in cells that are enclosed by 3s in all eight neighboring cells. But in Example 0's cell (2,2), the eight neighbors would include the four orthogonal and four diagonal. Let's see: in Example0's input, cell (2,2) is0. Up is3, down is3, left is3, right is3. Diagonally: up-left (row1,1) is0, up-right (row1,3) is0, down-left (row3,1) is3, down-right (row3,3) is0. So diagonally only one 3. So that's total of four orthogonal and one diagonal. So eight neighbors: four 3s. That might not be enough. So maybe that's not the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are placed where a cell is part of a plus sign of 3s. For example, a cell that is surrounded by 3s in a cross shape. But again, this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 2's output. The 4s are in row3, columns4 and5. Let's check the input cell (3,4): it's0. In the input, row3 is [3,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,3,0]. So cell (3,4) is0. The output is4. Checking neighbors:\n\nOrthogonal: up (row2,4) is3 (input row2: [0,3,3,0,3,3,0,3,0,0], column4 is3). Down (row4,4): input row4 is [0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,0,0], column4 is0. Left (row3,3) is3. Right (row3,5) is0. So orthogonal neighbors: up 3, left 3, others 0. So two 3s. But in output, it's4. So this doesn't fit the four orthogonal 3s rule.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe the cell is a 0 and is part of a 3x3 square where the center is 0 and surrounded by 3s. Let's see. For Example0's cell (2,2), the 3x3 square around it would have 3s in all surrounding cells except the center. But in reality, the input has 3s in the four orthogonal directions but not the diagonals. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the 4s are placed in cells where the cell is a 0 and is part of a \"room\" or enclosed area by 3s. But this is vague.\n\nWait, looking at Example 4's input and output. In the input, row8 (index8) has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output has 3s and 4s. For example, row2, column8 becomes4. Let's check the input: row2, column8 is0. Its neighbors: up row1, column8 is3 (input row1 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,...]), down row3, column8 is3 (input row3 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,...]), left row2,7 is3, right row2,9 is3. So four orthogonal 3s. So this fits the earlier rule of 0s with four orthogonal 3s becoming4.\n\nIn Example3, the 4s are in a 2x2 block. Let's check one of them. For example, cell (2,3) in input is0. Up: row1,3 is3 (input row1 has 3s in columns2-5). Down: row3,3 is0. Left: row2,2 is3. Right: row2,4 is0. So only two orthogonal 3s. But it becomes4. So this doesn't fit the four 3s rule. So there must be another pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that a 0 becomes4 if it is adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to exactly three 3s. Let's check:\n\nExample0's cell (2,2) is0. Adjacent cells (8 neighbors). Let's count:\n\nUp:3, down:3, left:3, right:3. Diagonals: up-left (0), up-right (0), down-left (3), down-right (0). So total of 4+1=5 3s. Not three.\n\nExample1's cell (4,6) is0. Adjacent cells: up (3), down (3), left (3), right (3) \u2192 four, plus diagonals: up-left (0), up-right (0), down-left (0), down-right (0). So four 3s. Not three.\n\nExample3's cell (2,3) is0. Adjacent cells: up (3), left (3), down (0), right (0). Diagonally: up-left (3), up-right (3), down-left (0), down-right (0). So total 2 (ortho) + 2 (diag) =4. Not three.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe the 4s are placed in cells that form the centers of plus signs made of 3s. For example, a cross where there's a 3 above, below, left, and right of the cell, which is 0. So that would be four 3s in orthogonal directions, which fits Example0 and Example1. But in Example3, the 4s are in a block where this isn't the case.\n\nWait, maybe there are multiple conditions. For example, a cell becomes4 if either:\n\n1. It's a 0 and has four orthogonal 3s (forming a cross), or\n\n2. It's part of a 2x2 block of 0s surrounded by 3s in certain ways.\n\nBut how to unify all examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are placed in cells that are enclosed by 3s in a way that forms a diagonal cross. For example, if a 0 has four diagonal 3s (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), then it becomes4. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's cell (2,2): the four diagonal neighbors are (1,1)=0, (1,3)=0, (3,1)=0, (3,3)=0. So none. So that doesn't work.\n\nExample1's cell (4,6): diagonals are (3,5), (3,7), (5,5), (5,7). Input row3, column5 is0, row3,7 is0. row5,5 is3, row5,7 is0. So two 3s. Not four.\n\nExample3's cell (2,3): diagonals are (1,2)=3, (1,4)=3, (3,2)=3, (3,4)=0. So two 3s. Hmm.\n\nThis isn't matching either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s are cells that are part of a region that is entirely surrounded by 3s. For example, a enclosed area of 0s that are fully surrounded by 3s. But in Example3's 2x2 block, they are surrounded by 3s on some sides but not all. For instance, the block in row2-3, columns3-4: to the left is column2 which has 3s, to the right is column5 which has 3s in row2 but not row3. So maybe not fully enclosed.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the 4s are placed in cells that are part of a path or connected region of 3s, and the 4s mark certain intersections. But this is vague.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a common theme in the outputs. The 4s are always placed in positions where, in the input, the cell is 0, and after transformation, becomes 4. So the rule must involve converting certain 0s to 4s based on their neighbors.\n\nLooking back at the examples:\n\n- In Example0, the 4 is where four 3s meet orthogonally.\n\n- In Example1, same.\n\n- In Example2, there's a line of 4s in row3, columns4-5. Let's check cell (3,4). Input cell (3,4) is0. Orthogonal neighbors: up (row2,4)=3, down (row4,4)=0, left (row3,3)=3, right (row3,5)=0. So two 3s. Diagonally: up-left (row2,3)=0, up-right (row2,5)=3, down-left (row4,3)=3, down-right (row4,5)=0. So two diagonal 3s. Total of four 3s in the neighborhood. So maybe if the cell has four or more 3s in any neighbors (orthogonal or diagonal), it becomes4. Let's check:\n\nExample0's cell (2,2) has four orthogonal and one diagonal 3 \u2192 total of five. Becomes4.\n\nExample1's cell (4,6) has four orthogonal 3s \u2192 becomes4.\n\nExample2's cell (3,4) has two orthogonal and two diagonal 3s \u2192 four total. Becomes4.\n\nExample3's cell (2,3) has two orthogonal and two diagonal 3s \u2192 four total. Becomes4.\n\nExample4's cell (2,8) has four orthogonal 3s \u2192 becomes4.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: a cell becomes4 if it is 0 in the input and has at least four 3s in its eight neighboring cells (orthogonal and diagonal).\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample0's cell (2,2): four orthogonal 3s \u2192 total four. So yes.\n\nExample1's cell (4,6): four orthogonal 3s \u2192 yes.\n\nExample2's cell (3,4): two orthogonal and two diagonal \u2192 total four \u2192 yes.\n\nExample3's cell (2,3): up (3), left (3), up-left (3), up-right (3) \u2192 four \u2192 yes.\n\nBut wait, let's count precisely. For Example3's cell (2,3):\n\nNeighbors:\n\nUp: row1,3 \u21923.\n\nDown: row3,3 \u21920.\n\nLeft: row2,2 \u21923.\n\nRight: row2,4 \u21920.\n\nDiagonal up-left: row1,2 \u21923.\n\nDiagonal up-right: row1,4 \u21923.\n\nDiagonal down-left: row3,2 \u21923.\n\nDiagonal down-right: row3,4 \u21920.\n\nSo total of 3 (up), 3 (left), 3 (up-left), 3 (up-right), 3 (down-left) \u2192 five 3s. So five 3s. So the condition is met.\n\nSo the rule could be: any 0 cell that has four or more 3s in its eight neighboring cells becomes4.\n\nThis seems to fit all examples.\n\nLet's check another example.\n\nExample3's cell (7,8) in the output becomes4. The input cell (7,8) is0. Let's check its neighbors. Input row7 is [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,0,3]. Column8. So cell (7,8) is0.\n\nNeighbors:\n\nUp: row6,8 \u21923 (input row6: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0] \u2192 column8 is0. Wait, no. Row7 is index7 (0-based). Up would be row6, column8. Let me check the input for Example3's row6: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]. So column8 is0. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the rows wrong.\n\nWait Example3's input is:\n\nRow0: all 0s.\n\nRow1: [0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,0,0,3,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,0,3]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe cell in row7, column8 is0 (row7 is [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,0,3] \u2192 column8 is0). Let's check its eight neighbors:\n\nUp: row6, column8 \u21923 (row6: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0] \u2192 column8 is3).\n\nDown: row8, column8 \u21923 (row8: [0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,3,0] \u2192 column8 is3).\n\nLeft: row7,7 \u21923.\n\nRight: row7,9 \u21923 (column9 is3).\n\nDiagonal up-left: row6,7 \u21923 (row6, column7 is3).\n\nDiagonal up-right: row6,9 \u21920 (row6, column9 is0).\n\nDiagonal down-left: row8,7 \u21920 (row8, column7 is0).\n\nDiagonal down-right: row8,9 \u21920 (row8, column9 is0).\n\nOrthogonal neighbors: up(3), down(3), left(3), right(3) \u2192 four 3s.\n\nDiagonal: up-left(3), others 0. Total of five 3s. So meets the condition. So this cell becomes4, which matches the output.\n\nThus, the pattern seems to be: any cell that is 0 in the input and has four or more 3s in its eight neighboring cells (including diagonals) becomes a4. All other cells remain the same.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input.\n\nLet's look at the test input. We need to process each cell and check if it's a 0 and has at least four 3s in its eight neighbors.\n\nLet's go through the test input row by row.\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0: all 0s.\n\nRow1: [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,3,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow11: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0]\n\nRow13: [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow14: [0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow15: [0,0,3,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow17: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow18: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow19: all 0s.\n\nNow, we need to find all 0 cells in this grid that have at least four 3s in their eight neighboring cells.\n\nLet's start by checking each 0 cell.\n\nLet's take row3, column8 (cell 3,8) which is3. Not 0. Skip.\n\nLooking for 0s.\n\nLet's take row3, column4: the cell is3. Skip.\n\nRow4, column4: cell is3. Skip.\n\nRow5, column4:3. Skip.\n\nRow6, column13:3. Skip.\n\nRow7, column14:3. Skip.\n\nLet's look for a cell that is0 and check its neighbors.\n\nStarting from the top.\n\nRow1, column2:3. Skip.\n\nRow2, columns1:0 (row2, column1 is0). Let's check cell (2,1). Neighbors:\n\nUp: row1,1:0.\n\nDown: row3,1:0.\n\nLeft: row2,0:0.\n\nRight: row2,2:0.\n\nDiagonals: row1,0:0, row1,2:3, row3,0:0, row3,2:3.\n\nSo neighboring 3s: two (row1,2 and row3,2). Total of two. Not enough.\n\nRow2, column2:0. Cell (2,2) is0. Neighbors:\n\nUp: row1,2:3.\n\nDown: row3,2:3.\n\nLeft: row2,1:0.\n\nRight: row2,3:3.\n\nDiagonally: row1,1:0, row1,3:0, row3,1:0, row3,3:0.\n\nSo orthogonal 3s: up, down, right. Total three. Diagonals: none. Total 3. Less than four. So no change.\n\nRow3, column0:0. Neighbors: probably not enough.\n\nLet's look for areas where 3s are clustered. For example, in row5, which has 3s forming a horizontal line. The cell at row5, column9 is0. Let's check its neighbors. Row5: [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So cell (5,9) is0. Neighbors:\n\nUp: row4,9:3 (row4: column9 is3).\n\nDown: row6,9:0.\n\nLeft: row5,8:3.\n\nRight: row5,10:3.\n\nOrthogonal: up(3), left(3), right(3). Diagonals: up-left (row4,8:3), up-right (row4,10:0), down-left (row6,8:0), down-right (row6,10:0).\n\nTotal 3s: up, left, right, up-left \u2192 four. So this cell should become4.\n\nSo cell (5,9) becomes4.\n\nAnother candidate: row7, column14:0. Let's see. Row7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]. Cell (7,14) is0. Neighbors:\n\nUp: row6,14:3.\n\nDown: row8,14:0.\n\nLeft: row7,13:3.\n\nRight: row7,15:0.\n\nDiagonals: up-left (row6,13:3), up-right (row6,15:3), down-left (row8,13:3), down-right (row8,15:0).\n\nOrthogonal 3s: up, left. Diagonals: up-left, up-right, down-left. Total of 5. So meets the condition. So cell (7,14) becomes4.\n\nSimilarly, cell (7,15) is0. Let's check. Neighbors:\n\nUp: row6,15:3.\n\nDown: row8,15:0.\n\nLeft: row7,14:0.\n\nRight: row7,16:0.\n\nDiagonals: up-left (row6,14:3), up-right (row6,16:3), down-left (row8,14:0), down-right (row8,16:0).\n\nOrthogonal: up(3). Diagonals: up-left (3), up-right (3). Total of three. So not enough.\n\nAnother cell: row9, column9:3. Skip.\n\nRow9, column14:0. Cell (9,14) is0. Neighbors:\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0,0].\n\nNeighbors of cell (9,14):\n\nUp: row8,14:0.\n\nDown: row10,14:3.\n\nLeft: row9,13:3.\n\nRight: row9,15:0.\n\nDiagonals: up-left (row8,13:3), up-right (row8,15:0), down-left (row10,13:3), down-right (row10,15:0).\n\nOrthogonal: left(3), down(3). Diagonals: up-left(3), down-left(3). Total four 3s. So this cell (9,14) becomes4.\n\nAnother cell: row12, column8:0. Let's see. Row12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0]. Cell (12,8) is0. Neighbors:\n\nUp: row11,8:3.\n\nDown: row13,8:3.\n\nLeft: row12,7:3.\n\nRight: row12,9:3.\n\nOrthogonal: up, down, left, right \u2192 four 3s. So cell (12,8) becomes4.\n\nRow13, column8:3. Skip.\n\nRow12, column9:3. Skip.\n\nRow12, column10:0. Cell (12,10) is0. Neighbors:\n\nUp: row11,10:3.\n\nDown: row13,10:0.\n\nLeft: row12,9:3.\n\nRight: row12,11:0.\n\nDiagonals: up-left (row11,9:3), up-right (row11,11:3), down-left (row13,9:3), down-right (row13,11:0).\n\nOrthogonal: up, left. Diagonals: up-left, up-right, down-left. Total of five 3s. So cell (12,10) becomes4.\n\nRow15, column7:3. Skip.\n\nRow15, column10:3. Skip.\n\nRow16, column7:3. Skip.\n\nRow17, column7:3. Skip.\n\nRow18, column7:3. Skip.\n\nLooking for more cells. Let's check row5, column9 (earlier candidate) and others.\n\nIn row5, columns8 and9: row5 has [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Cell (5,9) is0. As before, neighbors give four 3s. So becomes4.\n\nSimilarly, in row5, column10:3.\n\nRow11, column9:3. Skip.\n\nRow11, column14:0. Let's check. Row11: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]. Cell (11,14) is0. Neighbors:\n\nUp: row10,14:3.\n\nDown: row12,14:3.\n\nLeft: row11,13:3.\n\nRight: row11,15:0.\n\nDiagonals: up-left (row10,13:3), up-right (row10,15:0), down-left (row12,13:3), down-right (row12,15:3).\n\nOrthogonal: up, down, left \u2192 three. Diagonals: up-left, down-left, down-right. Total of six 3s. So cell (11,14) becomes4.\n\nRow6, column14:3. Skip.\n\nRow7, column17:3. Skip.\n\nRow9, column17:3. Skip.\n\nRow10, column17:3. Skip.\n\nRow11, column17:3. Skip.\n\nRow12, column17:3. Skip.\n\nAnother area to check: row3, columns4-5-6-7-8. Let's see cell (3,4):0. Let's check neighbors. Row3: [0,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Cell (3,4) is3. Skip.\n\nRow3, column9:0. Cell (3,9) is0. Neighbors:\n\nUp: row2,9:0.\n\nDown: row4,9:3.\n\nLeft: row3,8:3.\n\nRight: row3,10:3.\n\nDiagonals: up-left (row2,8:0), up-right (row2,10:0), down-left (row4,8:3), down-right (row4,10:0).\n\nOrthogonal: down, left, right \u2192 three. Diagonals: down-left (3). Total four. So cell (3,9) becomes4.\n\nRow4, column9:3. Skip.\n\nRow4, column10:0. Cell (4,10) is0. Neighbors:\n\nUp: row3,10:3.\n\nDown: row5,10:3.\n\nLeft: row4,9:3.\n\nRight: row4,11:0.\n\nDiagonals: up-left (row3,9:0), up-right (row3,11:3), down-left (row5,9:0), down-right (row5,11:3).\n\nOrthogonal: up, down, left \u2192 three. Diagonals: up-right, down-right \u2192 two. Total five. So cell (4,10) becomes4.\n\nRow5, column10:3. Skip.\n\nRow4, column4:3. Skip.\n\nRow4, column5:0. Cell (4,5) is0. Neighbors:\n\nUp: row3,5:3.\n\nDown: row5,5:3.\n\nLeft: row4,4:3.\n\nRight: row4,6:0.\n\nDiagonals: up-left (row3,4:3), up-right (row3,6:3), down-left (row5,4:3), down-right (row5,6:3).\n\nOrthogonal: up, down, left \u2192 three. Diagonals: up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right \u2192 four. Total seven. So cell (4,5) becomes4.\n\nThis is getting time-consuming. Based on the time I have, I'll need to identify all such cells in the test input and replace them with 4s.\n\nApplying this rule to the entire test input, the cells that are 0 and have at least four 3s in their eight neighbors will become4. The rest remain as is.\n\nThe final step is to generate the output grid by applying this rule.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples. Then apply that to the test input. Let me start by looking at the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input has some 3s arranged in a sort of cross or diamond shape. The output adds 4s where the original 3s are surrounded by other 3s in a certain way. For instance, the center 3 in the middle becomes a 4. Maybe it's about cells that are surrounded by 3s in all four directions? Or maybe it's about the number of adjacent 3s.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 4 is in the middle where the original 3 has two 3s diagonally. Wait, no. Let me look again. The input row 2 (0-based) is [0,3,0,3,0,0]. The output becomes [0,3,4,3,0,0]. So the middle 0 turned into 4? Wait no, the input here was 0. Wait, no, wait, the input is:\n\nOriginal input for Example 0:\n\nRow 1 (assuming 0-based) is [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 2: [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nRow 3: [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 1 stays the same.\n\nRow 2 becomes [0,3,4,3,0,0]\n\nRow 3 becomes [0,0,3,4,3,0]\n\nSo the 4s are placed where the original cell was 0, but surrounded by 3s? Let's check. The cell at (2,2) in the input is 0. In the output, it's 4. Looking at its neighbors: up is 3 (from row1, column2), down is 3 (row3, column2), left is 3 (row2, column1), right is 3 (row2, column3). So all four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are 3s. So maybe when a cell is 0 and all four adjacent cells are 3s, it becomes 4. Wait, but in Example 0's input, the cell at (2,2) is 0, and all four directions (N, S, E, W) are 3s. Then in the output, that cell becomes 4. Similarly, in row3, column3 in input is 0, and perhaps its four neighbors are 3s (left is 3, up is 3, down is 3, right is 3?), let me check.\n\nWait, row3 in input is [0,0,3,0,3,0]. So cell (3,3) is 0. The neighbors: up is row2 column3 which is 3, down is row4 column3 which is 3, left is row3 column2 which is 3, right is row3 column4 which is 3. So yes, all four directions are 3s. So that cell becomes 4. So the rule could be: a cell is 0, and all four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are 3s. Then it becomes 4. Let's check other examples.\n\nTake Example 1. The output has a 4 in row4, column6. Let's look at the input. Input row4, column6. The original cell is 0. Let's check its neighbors. Up is row3 column6: 3 (from input row3: [0, 0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0], so column6 is 0? Wait, maybe I'm getting the rows and columns mixed up. Let me clarify.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the row index is from 0 to 9. Let's look at the output's 4 in row4, column6 (assuming rows are 0-based). Input row4 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]. Wait, maybe not. Let me recheck.\n\nWait Example 1's input is:\n\nInput row 3 (assuming 0-based) is [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]. So column 6 here is 3. The output's 4 is in row4 (0-based?), column6. Let me check the input's row4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]. So column6 is 0. So the cell (4,6) is 0. Let's check its four neighbors: up is row3, column6: which is 3. Down is row5, column6: looking at input row5: [0,0,0,3,0,3,3,0,0,0]. Column6 is 3. Left is row4, column5: 3. Right is row4, column7: 3 (since row4's entry is [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0], column7 is 3. So up, down, left, right are 3,3,3,3. So the cell (4,6) in input is 0, surrounded by 3s in all four directions, so becomes 4. That fits the pattern.\n\nAnother example: in Example 3's output, there's a 4 in row2, column3. Let's check input. Input row2 is [0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]. So cell (2,3) is 0. Its neighbors: up (row1) column3 is 3 (input row1 is [0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0], column3 is 3). Down (row3) column3 is 3 (input row3 is [0,0,3,0,0,3,0,3,0,0], column3 is 0. Wait, no. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's check again.\n\nWait Example 3's input row2 is [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So cell (2,3) is 0. Up is row1, column3: in input row1, the fourth element (0-based) is 3 (since row1 is [0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0], so index 3 is 3. So up is 3. Down is row3, column3: input row3 is [0,0,3,0,0,3,0,3,0,0], column3 is 0. Left is row2, column2: 3. Right is row2, column4: 0. So the cell (2,3) in input is 0. Its neighbors: up 3, down 0, left 3, right 0. So not all four directions are 3. But in the output, it's 4. So this contradicts the previous hypothesis. Hmm, so maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the direction is different. Maybe diagonals are involved. Or maybe it's the count of 3s in the eight surrounding cells. Let me check again.\n\nIn Example 3's output, the 4s are in row2, columns 3 and 4. Let's look at input row2, columns 3 and 4. The input row2 is [0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]. So columns 3 and 4 are 0 and 0. In output, they become 4 and 4. What are their neighbors?\n\nFor cell (2,3): up row1, column3 is 3. Down row3, column3 is 0. Left row2, column2 is 3. Right row2, column4 is 0. So up and left are 3, others are 0. Not all four directions. But output is 4. So that breaks the initial rule. Hmm. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 3, the 4s form a square in row2 and 3, columns 3 and 4. The input in those rows: row2 has 3, 0, 0, 3. Row3 has 3,0,0,3. So perhaps the 4s are in regions where they are surrounded by 3s on the sides. Wait, maybe the cells that are 0 and have 3s in all four orthogonal directions (up, down, left, right) become 4. But in Example 3, those cells don't meet that condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about being enclosed by 3s in some way. Like, if a 0 is completely enclosed by 3s in a certain pattern. For example, maybe the 4 is placed in a 0 that is part of a \"hole\" inside a 3 structure. For example, in Example 3, the input has a square of 3s with some 0s inside, which are replaced by 4s. Let me see:\n\nIn Example 3's input, the first few rows:\n\nRow1: [0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,0,0,3,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0]\n\nSo there's a sort of rectangle or square made of 3s. The 0s inside this structure (rows 2-3, columns 3-4) are turned into 4s. So maybe 4s are placed in 0s that are completely enclosed by 3s in a rectangular region. But how does that apply to other examples?\n\nIn Example 0, the 4s are in the center of a cross of 3s, forming a diamond. But perhaps that's a diamond-shaped enclosure. So maybe 4s are 0s that are enclosed by 3s in all four directions (like a plus sign), but not necessarily forming a rectangle. Or perhaps the 0 is part of a closed loop made by 3s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a matter of the 0 cells that are adjacent (maybe diagonally) to exactly four 3s. Let me check Example 0's cell (2,2) in input, which is 0. The four orthogonally adjacent cells are all 3s. So that's four. So perhaps the rule is: if a 0 cell has exactly four 3s in its up, down, left, right neighbors, then it becomes 4. Let's test that.\n\nIn Example 3's cell (2,3): up is 3, down is 0, left is 3, right is 0. So two 3s. But in output, it's 4. So that doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the 4s are placed where the cell is 0 and has exactly two diagonal 3s. For example, in Example 0's (2,2) cell, the diagonals are (1,1)=0, (1,3)=0, (3,1)=0, (3,3)=0. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the 4s are placed in 0 cells that are part of a cross where the cross has exactly two 3s in orthogonal directions. Wait, not sure.\n\nLooking back at Example 3's output, the 4s are in a 2x2 square. The input for those cells is 0s, but their surrounding is 3s. Wait, in row2, column3 is 0, but in the input, the surrounding cells:\n\nUp: row1 column3 is 3.\n\nLeft: row2 column2 is 3.\n\nRight: row2 column4 is 0.\n\nDown: row3 column3 is 0.\n\nSo only up and left are 3s. But output is 4. Hmm. This suggests that the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are placed in regions where the 0 is enclosed by 3s in a way that forms a square. Like in Example 3, the 4s are in a 2x2 square inside a larger 3 structure. But how to generalize.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace 0s that are part of a \"plus\" pattern where the four adjacent cells are 3s. But in Example 3, that doesn't hold.\n\nWait, let's think of the output cells. The 4s are placed in 0 cells that are surrounded by 3s in some way, but not necessarily all four directions. Maybe the number of adjacent 3s is even, or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are part of a path that connects 3s. For example, filling in 0s between 3s to form a continuous line. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output matrices for each example and see what changes. For each cell that becomes 4, what's the condition in the input.\n\nIn Example 0, the 4s are at positions (2,2) and (3,3). In input:\n\nAt (2,2) is 0. Its neighbors: up (1,2) is 3, down (3,2) is 3, left (2,1) is 3, right (2,3) is 3. So all four adjacent cells are 3. Hence, 4.\n\nAt (3,3) in input is 0. Up (2,3) is 3, down (4,3) is 3, left (3,2) is 3, right (3,4) is 3. Again, all four adjacent are 3. So 4.\n\nIn Example 1, the 4 is at (4,6). Input cell (4,6) is 0. Its four neighbors: up (3,6) is 3, down (5,6) is 3, left (4,5) is 3, right (4,7) is 3. All four are 3. So 4.\n\nIn Example 2's output, there are multiple 4s. Let's check one. For example, row3, column4 is 4. Input cell (3,4) is 0. Checking four neighbors: up (2,4) is 3, down (4,4) is 0. So that's not all 3s. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, Example 2's input row3 is [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0]. So cell (3,4) is 0. Let's check:\n\nUp: row2, column4. Input row2 is [0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]. So column4 is 3.\n\nDown: row4, column4 is 3 (input row4: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0], column4 is 0. Wait, row4's fourth element? Let me index correctly. Each row is a list, so row4 is [0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,0,0]. So column4 (index 3) is 3. Then column4 (index 4) is 0. So cell (3,4) in input is 0. Up is row2, column4: 3. Down is row4, column4: 0. Left is row3, column3: 3. Right is row3, column5: 0. So up and left are 3, down and right are 0. So two 3s. But output is 4. Hmm, this contradicts the earlier pattern.\n\nSo this suggests that the initial hypothesis is wrong. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The output replaces certain 0s with 4s, especially in row3 and 4. For instance, in input row3, columns 4 and 5 are 0, but in output they are 4. Let's check their neighbors.\n\nRow3, column4: 0 in input. Up: row2 column4 is 3. Down: row4 column4 is 0. Left: row3 column3 is 3. Right: row3 column5 is 0. So up and left are 3. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of 3s in the eight surrounding cells. Let's count for row3, column4 in input example 2. The 8 neighbors:\n\nUp-left: row2, column3: 0.\n\nUp: row2, column4: 3.\n\nUp-right: row2, column5: 3.\n\nLeft: row3, column3: 3.\n\nRight: row3, column5: 0.\n\nDown-left: row4, column3: 3.\n\nDown: row4, column4: 0.\n\nDown-right: row4, column5: 0.\n\nTotal 3s: up (3), up-right (3), left (3), down-left (3). That's four 3s. So maybe if a 0 cell has four or more 3s in its Moore neighborhood (8 directions), it becomes 4. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 0's cell (2,2), which is 0 in input. The eight neighbors would be:\n\nRow1, column1: 0.\n\nRow1, column2:3.\n\nRow1, column3:0.\n\nRow2, column1:3.\n\nRow2, column3:3.\n\nRow3, column1:0.\n\nRow3, column2:3.\n\nRow3, column3:0.\n\nSo the 3s are: up (3), left (3), right (3), down (3). So four 3s. So in eight neighbors, four 3s. Hence, becomes 4.\n\nIn Example 1's cell (4,6): let's count eight neighbors. Up row3,6: 3, up-right row3,7:0. Right row4,7:3. Down row5,6:3. Down-right row5,7:0. Left row4,5:3. Down-left row5,5:3. Up-left row3,5:0. So 3s at up, left, down, down-left. Four 3s. So four 3s in eight neighbors, becomes 4.\n\nIn Example 2's cell (3,4): eight neighbors have four 3s, as calculated earlier, so becomes 4.\n\nIn Example 3's cell (2,3): let's count eight neighbors.\n\nRow1,2:3.\n\nRow1,3:3.\n\nRow1,4:3.\n\nRow2,2:3.\n\nRow2,4:0.\n\nRow3,2:3.\n\nRow3,3:0.\n\nRow3,4:0.\n\nSo the neighbors: up (3,3) is 3, up-left (row1,2) is 3, up-right (row1,4) is 3, left (row2,2) is3, right (row2,4) is0, down-left (row3,2) is3, down (row3,3) is0, down-right (row3,4) is0. So total 3s: up, up-left, up-right, left, down-left. That's five 3s. So five 3s in eight directions. So perhaps the rule is that if a 0 cell has at least four 3s in its eight neighboring cells, it becomes 4.\n\nAlternatively, exactly four, but in Example 2, cell (3,4) had four 3s, and in Example 3, cell (2,3) has five. So maybe any number >=4.\n\nBut let's check other cells. For example, in Example 0's cell (3,3) in input, which becomes 4. Let's count its eight neighbors:\n\nRow2,2:3.\n\nRow2,3:3.\n\nRow2,4:3.\n\nRow3,2:3.\n\nRow3,4:3.\n\nRow4,2:0.\n\nRow4,3:3.\n\nRow4,4:0.\n\nSo neighbors: up-left (3), up (3), up-right (3), left (3), right (3), down (3). Six 3s. So six 3s in eight directions. So more than four.\n\nBut in Example 3's cell (2,3), five 3s. So seems like the rule is that any 0 cell with four or more 3s in its eight surrounding cells becomes 4.\n\nLet's test this with other examples.\n\nExample 3's cell (7,8) in output is 4. Let's check input. Input row7 is [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,0,3]. So cell (7,8) is 0. Let's count eight neighbors:\n\nRow6,7: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]. Column7 is 3.\n\nRow6,8: 0.\n\nRow6,9:0.\n\nRow7,7:3.\n\nRow7,9:3.\n\nRow8,7:0.\n\nRow8,8:0.\n\nRow8,9:3.\n\nSo eight neighbors: up (row6,7:3), up-right (row6,8:0), right (row7,9:3), down-right (row8,9:3), down (row8,8:0), down-left (row8,7:0), left (row7,7:3), up-left (row6,6:0). So 3s are up, right, down-right, left. That's four 3s. So this cell (7,8) becomes 4 in output. So fits the rule.\n\nBut wait, the input cell (7,8) is 0, and has four 3s in neighbors. So yes.\n\nAnother test: in Example 3's row8, column4. Output is 4. Let's check input. Input row8 is [0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,3,0]. Cell (8,4) is 0. Eight neighbors:\n\nRow7,3:3.\n\nRow7,4:3.\n\nRow7,5:0.\n\nRow8,3:3.\n\nRow8,5:3.\n\nRow9,3:0.\n\nRow9,4:3.\n\nRow9,5:0.\n\nSo neighbors: up (7,4:3), up-left (7,3:3), up-right (7,5:0), left (8,3:3), right (8,5:3), down-left (9,3:0), down (9,4:3), down-right (9,5:0). So 3s: up, up-left, left, right, down. Five 3s. So >=4. Output is 4. Fits.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: a cell is 0 in input, and in its eight surrounding cells (Moore neighborhood) there are at least four 3s. Then, it becomes 4 in output.\n\nLet me verify this across all examples.\n\nExample 4's input has a cell in row2, column8 (0-based) which becomes 4. Input cell is 0. Let's check eight neighbors. The input row2 is [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,0, ...]. Wait, the exact input for Example 4's row2 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, ...]. So cell (2,8) is 0. Its eight neighbors:\n\nRow1,7:0.\n\nRow1,8:3.\n\nRow1,9:0.\n\nRow2,7:3.\n\nRow2,9:3.\n\nRow3,7:0.\n\nRow3,8:3.\n\nRow3,9:0.\n\nSo neighbors: up (row1,8:3), right (row2,9:3), down (row3,8:3), left (row2,7:3). So four 3s. Hence, becomes 4.\n\nAnother cell in Example 4's input is row5, column9. Input cell (5,9) is 3. Output is 4. Wait no, in Example 4's output row5 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,0,0,0,0]. So column9 (index 9) is 4. Input row5 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]. So cell (5,9) is 0. Let's check eight neighbors:\n\nRow4,8:3.\n\nRow4,9:0.\n\nRow4,10:3.\n\nRow5,8:3.\n\nRow5,10:0.\n\nRow6,8:3.\n\nRow6,9:0.\n\nRow6,10:0.\n\nSo up (4,9:0), up-left (4,8:3), up-right (4,10:3), left (5,8:3), right (5,10:0), down (6,9:0), down-left (6,8:3), down-right (6,10:0). So 3s are up-left, up-right, left, down-left. Four 3s. Hence, becomes 4.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the rule is: any cell that is 0 in the input and has at least four 3s in its eight neighboring cells (Moore neighborhood) is replaced with 4 in the output. All other cells remain the same.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nThe test input is a 20x20 grid. We need to go through each cell, check if it's 0, and if its eight neighbors have at least four 3s. If so, replace with 4.\n\nLet me look at the test input. For example, let's look for cells that are 0 and have many 3s around them.\n\nFor example, row3 in test input: [0,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So cell (3,4) is 3. But perhaps looking for 0s. Let's check cell (3,9). It's 0. Let's check its neighbors.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let's look for clusters of 3s and see where 0s are enclosed.\n\nLooking at row3 in test input: [0, 0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The cell (3,8) is 3. Hmm. Maybe looking for a region where 0s are surrounded by 3s.\n\nAnother example: row12 (0-based) in test input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0]. So cell (12,8) is 0. Let's check its neighbors. Up row11, column8: looking at row11's input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]. So row11, column8 is 3. Down row13, column8: row13's input is [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So column8 is 3. Left row12, column7:3. Right row12, column9:3. So four orthogonal directions: up, down, left, right are all 3. So eight neighbors would have more. For cell (12,8), which is 0, the eight neighbors:\n\nup (11,8):3\n\nup-left (11,7):0 (row11's column7 is 0).\n\nup-right (11,9):3.\n\nleft (12,7):3.\n\nright (12,9):3.\n\ndown (13,8):3.\n\ndown-left (13,7):0.\n\ndown-right (13,9):3.\n\nSo the 3s are up, up-right, right, down, down-right, left. That's six 3s. So >=4. So this cell becomes 4.\n\nSimilarly, in row5 of test input: [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Cell (5,9) is 0. Let's check its neighbors:\n\nUp row4, column9:3 (row4's column9 is 3, as row4's input is [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So column9 is 3.\n\nDown row6, column9:0 (row6's column9 is part of [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0], so column9 is 0).\n\nLeft row5, column8:3.\n\nRight row5, column10:3.\n\nSo four orthogonal directions: up, left, right are 3, down is 0. So in eight neighbors, let's count:\n\nup:3.\n\nup-left: row4,8:0 (row4's column8 is 0).\n\nup-right: row4,10:3.\n\nleft:3.\n\nright:3.\n\ndown:0.\n\ndown-left: row6,8:0 (row6's column8 is 0).\n\ndown-right: row6,10:0.\n\nSo 3s: up, up-right, left, right. Four 3s. So cell (5,9) would become 4.\n\nAnother example: row6 in test input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0]. Let's look at cell (6,13) which is 3, but maybe there's a 0 near it. For example, cell (6,12) is 0. Check its neighbors.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to systematically check each cell. However, given time constraints, I'll look for regions where 0s are surrounded by multiple 3s.\n\nAnother area to look: row9 in test input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]. Cell (9,14) is 0. Let's check its neighbors:\n\nRow8,13:0.\n\nRow8,14:0.\n\nRow8,15:3.\n\nRow9,13:3.\n\nRow9,15:0.\n\nRow10,13:3.\n\nRow10,14:0.\n\nRow10,15:0.\n\nSo not enough 3s.\n\nBut perhaps in row9, column 9-13. For example, cell (9,9) is 3. Not a candidate. Cell (9,10) is 3.\n\nBut looking for 0s. For example, cell (9,14) is 0. Not sure.\n\nAnother area: row3 in test input: [0,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The cell (3,8) is 3. But cell (3,9) is 0. Let's check its eight neighbors:\n\nUp row2,8:0.\n\nUp-left row2,8:0.\n\nUp-right row2,10:0.\n\nLeft row3,8:3.\n\nRight row3,10:3.\n\nDown row4,9:3.\n\nDown-left row4,8:0.\n\nDown-right row4,10:0.\n\nSo 3s are left, right, down. Three 3s. So not enough.\n\nAnother candidate: row4 in test input: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Cell (4,4) is 3. Not a candidate. Cell (4,9) is 3. Also not.\n\nLooking at row12 in test input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0]. Cell (12,8) is 0. As before, this has six 3s around it.\n\nAnother cell: row15 in test input: [0,0,3,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Cell (15,5) is 0. Let's check neighbors.\n\nUp row14,5:0.\n\nDown row16,5:0.\n\nLeft row15,4:3.\n\nRight row15,6:3.\n\nSo orthogonal directions have two 3s. Let's check eight neighbors:\n\nUp-left: row14,4:3 (row14's column4 is 3).\n\nUp: row14,5:0.\n\nUp-right: row14,6:3.\n\nLeft:3.\n\nRight:3.\n\nDown-left: row16,4:0.\n\nDown:0.\n\nDown-right: row16,6:3.\n\nSo 3s: up-left, up-right, left, right, down-right. Five 3s. So cell (15,5) would become 4.\n\nSo based on this, the test output would have 4s in these positions where 0s in input are surrounded by four or more 3s in their eight neighbors.\n\nNow, applying this rule to each cell in the test input:\n\nBut since it's time-consuming to do all manually, let's focus on key areas.\n\nFor example, in row3 of the test input:\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking for 0s. Cell (3,3) is 0. Let's check its eight neighbors:\n\nRow2,2:3.\n\nRow2,3:0.\n\nRow2,4:3.\n\nRow3,2:3.\n\nRow3,4:3.\n\nRow4,2:0.\n\nRow4,3:0.\n\nRow4,4:3.\n\nSo neighbors: up-left (row2,2:3), up (row2,3:0), up-right (row2,4:3), left (row3,2:3), right (row3,4:3), down-left (row4,2:0), down (row4,3:0), down-right (row4,4:3). So 3s: up-left, up-right, left, right, down-right. Five 3s. So cell (3,3) becomes 4.\n\nAnother cell in row3 is (3,9):0. Let's check:\n\nUp row2,8:0.\n\nRow2,9:0.\n\nRow2,10:0.\n\nRow3,8:3.\n\nRow3,10:3.\n\nRow4,8:0.\n\nRow4,9:3.\n\nRow4,10:0.\n\nSo 3s: row3,8:3; row3,10:3; row4,9:3. Three 3s. Not enough.\n\nAnother cell in row3 is (3,12):0. Check neighbors:\n\nUp row2,11:0.\n\nRow2,12:0.\n\nRow2,13:0.\n\nRow3,11:3.\n\nRow3,13:0.\n\nRow4,11:0.\n\nRow4,12:3.\n\nRow4,13:0.\n\nSo 3s: row3,11:3; row4,12:3. Only two. Not enough.\n\nNow, cell (12,8) as discussed earlier would be 4.\n\nAnother area: row9 in test input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]. The cell (9,14) is 0. Let's check:\n\nUp row8,13:0.\n\nRow8,14:0.\n\nRow8,15:3.\n\nRow9,13:3.\n\nRow9,15:0.\n\nRow10,13:3.\n\nRow10,14:0.\n\nRow10,15:0.\n\nSo 3s: row8,15:3; row9,13:3; row10,13:3. Three 3s. Not enough.\n\nLooking at row5 in test input: [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Cell (5,9) is 0. As before, four 3s in eight neighbors. So becomes 4.\n\nRow6 in test input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0]. Cell (6,13) is 3. Not a candidate. Cell (6,12) is 0. Check neighbors:\n\nUp row5,11:3.\n\nRow5,12:3.\n\nRow5,13:3.\n\nRow6,11:0.\n\nRow6,13:3.\n\nRow7,11:0.\n\nRow7,12:0.\n\nRow7,13:3.\n\nSo eight neighbors: up-left (row5,11:3), up (row5,12:3), up-right (row5,13:3), left (row6,11:0), right (row6,13:3), down-left (row7,11:0), down (row7,12:0), down-right (row7,13:3). So 3s: up-left, up, up-right, right, down-right. Five 3s. So cell (6,12) becomes 4.\n\nRow7 in test input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]. Cell (7,15) is 0. Check neighbors:\n\nUp row6,14:3.\n\nRow6,15:3.\n\nRow6,16:3.\n\nRow7,14:3.\n\nRow7,16:3.\n\nRow8,14:3.\n\nRow8,15:0.\n\nRow8,16:3.\n\nSo 3s: up, up-left (row6,14:3), up-right (row6,16:3), left (row7,14:3), right (row7,16:3), down-left (row8,14:3), down-right (row8,16:3). So seven 3s. So cell (7,15) becomes 4.\n\nRow7, column15 is 0, so yes.\n\nIn row12, column8 is 0, becomes 4.\n\nIn row15, column5 is 0, becomes 4.\n\nNow, let's proceed to write the output based on these transformations.\n\nThe final answer should have 4s in all positions where the input cell is 0 and has at least four 3s in its eight neighboring cells.",
