        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input. \n\nLooking at the first training example (Example 0), the input has a bunch of 5s and 0s. The output replaces some 0s with numbers like 1, 2, 3. Hmm. Let me look at specific rows.\n\nTake the first input row of Example 0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5]. The output is [5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,3,5]. So the 0s at positions 4 and 8 (0-based index?) became 3s. Wait, maybe the position of the 0 matters. Let me check another row.\n\nIn Example 0, the second input row is [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5], output [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]. So the two leading 0s became 1s. Another row in Example 0's input: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0] becomes [1,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,2]. The 0s at the start became 1s, the 0s in the middle became 1s again, and the last 0 became a 2. So maybe the replacement depends on the position in the row. \n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of adjacent 0s? Like, each 0 is replaced by the count of how many 0s are in its contiguous group. But in the first row of Example 0, the two 0s are not adjacent. Wait, in the first input row, there's a 0 at index 4, then another at index 8. So they are single 0s. But they were replaced by 3s. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Because if it's the count, each would be 1, but they're 3. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement number is based on the number of 0s in the entire row? Let's check. For the first input row of Example 0: two 0s. The replacement is 3. Not sure. Second input row has two 0s, replaced by 1s. Third input row has four 0s (positions 0,6,7,9) and output has three 1s and a 2. So that doesn't align with the count of 0s in the row. \n\nAnother thought: maybe the replacement number is the distance from the nearest edge? For example, the position of the 0 in the row. Let's take the first row of Example 0 input: index 4 (0-based) is the first 0. The length of the row is 10 elements. So index 4 is 4 steps from the left (since indexes start at 0). But the output is 3. Wait, 4+1=5? No. Or maybe the distance from the nearest edge. For index 4 in a 10-element list, the distance from the left is 4, from the right is 5 (since 9-4=5). The minimum is 4, but output is 3. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement is the number of 5s between the 0 and the nearest edge. Let's think. In the first row of Example 0 input: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5]. The first 0 is at index 4. To the left are four 5s. To the right, there are three 5s before the next 0. Wait, but how does that relate to the replacement value 3? Maybe the number of 5s to the left and right? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is the count of 5s surrounding the 0. But in that case, for the first 0 at index 4, left neighbor is 5, right neighbor is 5. So two 5s. But the replacement is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, the numbers used are 1, 2, 3. So maybe it's a code for directions or positions. Let's check the positions where 0s are replaced. For example, in the first row of Example 0's input, the 0s are at positions 4 and 8 (if index starts at 0). The replacement is 3. How does 4 and 8 relate to 3? 4 + 8 =12, not sure. Maybe the replacement is the number of steps to the nearest 0 in some direction? Not sure.\n\nLet's take another example. In Example 1's first input row: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5], output [5,5,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5]. The two 0s are replaced by 2s. The 0s are at positions 5 and 6. Maybe the middle of the list? The list has 10 elements, so indices 0-9. The middle would be around 4.5. Positions 5 and 6 are in the second half. But why 2? Maybe grouping the positions into thirds. For 10 elements, perhaps each third is 3 elements, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement number represents the number of non-zero elements (5s) in the same group. Wait, in the first input row of Example 0, the two 0s are isolated. Each is a group of one. But their replacement is 3, which might not correspond. \n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the output. For instance, in the first row of Example 0's output, 0s are replaced by 3. In the second row of the same example, 0s are replaced by 1. Third row, 0s are replaced by 1s except the last one which is 2. Maybe the replacement number depends on the position of the 0 in the row. For example, starting from the left, count how many 0s have been encountered before, but that seems not to fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input and output, perhaps the replacement numbers are based on the number of 0s in the same row, but with some pattern. Let's count the 0s in each input row and see the replacement numbers:\n\nExample 0:\n\nRow 0 input has 2 zeros \u2192 output has 3,3. So sum is 6.\n\nRow 1 input has 2 zeros \u2192 output has 1,1. Sum 2.\n\nRow 2 input has 4 zeros \u2192 output has 1,1,1,2. Sum 5.\n\nNot a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is the number of 0s in the same column. Let's check. For example, in Example 0:\n\nFirst input row has 0s at columns 4 and 8. Let's look at the other rows to see how many 0s are in those columns.\n\nColumn 4 across all input rows in Example 0:\n\nRow0:0, row1:5, row2:5, row3:5, row4:0, row5:5, row6:0, row7:5, row8:5, row9:5. So in column 4, there are 0s in row0, row4, row6. So three 0s. But in row0's output, the replacement is 3. Hmm, that matches. Let's check column 8 in row0: it's 0. Let's see how many 0s are in column 8 across all rows. Row0:0, row1:5, row2:5, row3:5, row4:5, row5:0, row6:5, row7:5, row8:5, row9:0. So column 8 has 0s in row0, row5, row9. Three 0s. So in row0's output, the replacements are 3,3. That matches. \n\nSo the replacement number for a 0 in column x is the number of 0s in column x across all input rows. Let's test this hypothesis with another example.\n\nTake Example 0's second input row: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]. The first two elements are 0s. Let's look at column 0 across all rows:\n\nRow0:5, row1:0, row2:0, row3:5, row4:5, row5:0, row6:0, row7:5, row8:5, row9:0. Wait, wait, maybe I got the rows and columns mixed. Wait, in the input, each line is a row, and each element in the line is a column. So for Example 0, there are 10 rows, each with 10 elements (columns 0-9).\n\nSo for the first row (row0) in Example 0's input, the 0s are at columns 4 and 8.\n\nFor column 4 in Example 0's input:\n\nLooking at all rows in Example 0's input:\n\nRow0: column4 is 0.\n\nRow1: column4 is 5.\n\nRow2: column4 is 5.\n\nRow3: column4 is 5.\n\nRow4: column4 is 0.\n\nRow5: column4 is 5.\n\nRow6: column4 is 0.\n\nRow7: column4 is 5.\n\nRow8: column4 is 5.\n\nRow9: column4 is 5.\n\nSo column4 has 0s in rows 0,4,6 \u2192 three 0s. So replacement is 3, which matches the output in row0's column4. Similarly, column8 in row0 is 0. Let's check column8 in all input rows:\n\nRow0: column8 is 0.\n\nRow1: column8 is 5.\n\nRow2: column8 is 5.\n\nRow3: column8 is 0.\n\nRow4: column8 is5.\n\nRow5: column8 is 0.\n\nRow6: column8 is5.\n\nRow7: column8 is5.\n\nRow8: column8 is5.\n\nRow9: column8 is0.\n\nSo column8 has 0s in rows 0,3,5,9 \u2192 four 0s. Wait, but in the output for row0's column8, it's 3. That doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I counted wrong.\n\nWait, the input for Example 0 has 10 rows. Let me check each row's column8:\n\nRow0:0 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow1:5.\n\nRow2:5.\n\nRow3:0.\n\nRow4:5.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:5.\n\nRow7:5.\n\nRow8:0 (because input row8 is [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0] \u2192 column9 is 0. So column8 in row8 is 5 (since 0 is at index9). So column8 in row8 is 5. Then row9's column8 is 0 (input row9 is [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0] \u2192 the 0s are at 0,7,9. So column8 is 5. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's clarify:\n\nEach input row is a list of 10 elements. So for column8 (index8), looking at each row in Example0's input:\n\nRow0: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5] \u2192 column8 (index8) is 0.\n\nRow1: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5] \u2192 column8 is5.\n\nRow2: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0] \u2192 column8 is5.\n\nRow3: [5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0] \u2192 column8 is5.\n\nRow4: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5] \u2192 column8 is5.\n\nRow5: [0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0] \u2192 column8 is5.\n\nRow6: [0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0] \u2192 column8 is5.\n\nRow7: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5] \u2192 column8 is5.\n\nRow8: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0] \u2192 column8 is5 (since index9 is 0).\n\nRow9: [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0] \u2192 column8 is5 (index8 is5, then 0 is at index9).\n\nSo column8 in Example0's input has 0 only in row0, row3 (wait no: row3's column7 is 0, column8 is5. Let me check row3 again. Input row3 is [5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0]. So index7 is 0, index8 is5. So column8 in row3 is5. So the only row with column8 as 0 is row0. Then how come in row0's output, the 0 at column8 is replaced by3? According to previous assumption that it's the count of 0s in the column, then column8 would have 1 zero (only row0). But the output is 3. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recheck.\n\nFor Example0's input, column4 (index4):\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nSo three 0s. So output for column4's 0 in row0 is3, which matches.\n\nColumn8 in row0 is0. Let's check column8 across all rows in input:\n\nRow0:0.\n\nRow1:5.\n\nRow2:5.\n\nRow3:5.\n\nRow4:5.\n\nRow5:5.\n\nRow6:5.\n\nRow7:5.\n\nRow8:5.\n\nRow9:5.\n\nSo column8 has only one 0 (row0). But the output for row0's column8 is3, which doesn't fit. So the initial hypothesis is wrong. \n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the replacement number is the number of 0s in the same row before the current 0. Let's check. For example, in the first input row of Example0, [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5]. The first 0 is at index4. How many 0s are before it in the row? Zero. So replacement would be 0, but output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the replacement is the sum of the indices of the 0s in the row. For example, in the first row, indices4 and8. Sum is4+8=12. But output is3. 12 mod 10? 2? Not matching.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output row0: the 0s are replaced by3. In the output row1, the two 0s are replaced by1. Maybe the replacement is the count of 0s in the same row. For row0, two 0s \u21923. No. For row1, two zeros \u21921. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement number is based on the position of the row in the input. For example, row0 is first, so replacement is3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement number is the number of 0s in the entire input grid. For Example0, the input has 10 rows. Let's count the total zeros. Let's see:\n\nRow0: 2 zeros.\n\nRow1: 2.\n\nRow2:4.\n\nRow3:2 (0s at index2 and7).\n\nRow4:2 (0s at4 and5).\n\nRow5:3 (indices0,2,7,9?) Wait, input row5 is [0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0] \u2192 four zeros.\n\nRow6:3 zeros (indices0,4,5,9 \u2192 input row6 is [0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0] \u2192 zeros at 0,4,5,9 \u2192 four zeros.\n\nRow7:0.\n\nRow8:1.\n\nRow9:3 (indices0,7,9).\n\nTotal zeros: 2+2+4+2+2+4+4+0+1+3= 24. But the replacement numbers are up to3. Not sure how that would map.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the replacement number is the count of consecutive 0s starting from that position. But in row0's input, each 0 is single. So the count is1, but output is3. No.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement number is the number of surrounding 0s in the grid. For example, for a 0 at (row, col), check the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) and count how many are 0. But that seems complex, but let's check.\n\nTake Example0, row0, column4. The cell is0. Its adjacent cells: up is none (since it's the first row), down is row1, column4 (which is5). Left is5, right is5. So no adjacent zeros. So count is0, but output is3. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe the replacement is the number of 0s in the same column, but in the rows above. Let's test. For row0, column4: since it's the first row, there are no rows above. So count is0. But output is3. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is the number of 0s in the same column in the rows below. For row0, column4, look at rows1-9 in column4. Let's count:\n\nRow1, column4:5.\n\nRow2:5.\n\nRow3:5.\n\nRow4:0.\n\nRow5:5.\n\nRow6:0.\n\nRow7:5.\n\nRow8:5.\n\nRow9:5.\n\nSo in rows1-9, column4 has two 0s (rows4 and6). So total 2. Output is3. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, row0's column4: the 0 in row0, plus those below. So total 3 (row0,4,6). Which is 3. Output is3. Oh, that matches. Let's check another example.\n\nTake row1 in Example0's input: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]. The first two elements are 0s. Let's check column0.\n\nIn row1, column0 is0. Let's count all zeros in column0 across all rows (including row1). For Example0:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRow0:5.\n\nRow1:0.\n\nRow2:0.\n\nRow3:5.\n\nRow4:5.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:0.\n\nRow7:5.\n\nRow8:5.\n\nRow9:0.\n\nSo total zeros: rows1,2,5,6,9 \u2192 5 zeros. But the replacement in row1's output is1. So that doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nWait, in row0's column4: the total zeros in that column (including itself) is3. Output is3. So maybe the replacement is the count of zeros in the column. That works here. Let's check another case.\n\nIn Example0's row1, the zeros are at columns0 and1. Let's look at column0's total zeros: rows1,2,5,6,9 \u2192 5 zeros. But output is1. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. So perhaps this pattern doesn't hold. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the numbers are 1,2,3. So maybe they are grouped into clusters. For instance, the first example's row0 output has 3s, which could indicate something like the third group. Wait, perhaps the replacement numbers indicate the order in which the 0s appear when reading the grid in a certain direction. For example, left to right, top to bottom.\n\nBut in Example0's input, the first 0 is in row0, column4. Then row0, column8. Then row1, columns0 and1. Etc. But how would that order translate to 3,3,1,1 etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the output for a specific row and see if there's a pattern in the replacements. For example, in Example0's output row2: [1,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,2]. The 0s in the input row2 are at positions0,6,7,9. The outputs are1,1,1,2. The first three are 1, last is2. Why?\n\nWait, input row2 is [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0]. The output replaces each 0 with 1 except the last one which is2. What's different about the last 0? It's at the end of the row. Maybe trailing 0s are treated differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement number is determined by the number of 5s immediately following the 0. For example, in the input row2's last 0, there are no 5s after it (since it's the last element). So replacement is2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is the count of 5s before the 0. Let's see:\n\nFor row2's first 0 (position0), no 5s before. Replacement is1.\n\nSecond 0 (position6): five 5s before. Replacement is1.\n\nThird 0 (position7): five 5s before (since after position6 is 0). Replacement is1.\n\nFourth 0 (position9): nine elements before. But how many 5s? Let's see: in the input row2, the elements up to index9 are [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0]. So for index9, before it are the previous elements. The count of 5s up to index8 is 0 (index0) \u21920, then indices1-5 are 5s (5), index6 is0,7 is0,8 is5. So total 5+1=6. Replacement is2. Not sure.\n\nThis seems too vague. Let's try another example. Example1's output row0: [5,5,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5]. The input row0's zeros are at positions5 and6. The replacement is2. What's special about positions5 and6? The length of the row is10, so positions5 and6 are the fifth and sixth elements. Maybe in the middle. If the replacement is determined by the distance from the left edge. For position5, distance is5. If divided into sections, like 0-3, 4-6, 7-9, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number could be the number of the quadrant the 0 is in. For example, split the row into two parts: left and right. If a 0 is in the first half (positions0-4), replacement is1. If in the second half (5-9), replacement is2. For Example0's row0, positions4 and8: 4 is in first half (if 0-4 is first five), then replacement would be1 for position4, but output is3. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is the number of the quadrant in a 3-way split. For example, split into thirds. For a row of 10 elements, each third would be approximately 3 elements. But 10 divided by 3 is roughly 3,3,4. So positions0-2: first third, 3-5: second, 6-9: third. Then replacement could be1,2,3. For Example0's row0, positions4 (second third) and8 (third third). So replacement would be2 and3. But output is3 and3. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the pattern is not per row but per column. Let's look at the columns across the entire grid. For example, in Example0's input and output:\n\nFor each 0 in the input, look at the column and see the output replacement. For instance, in row0, column4: output3. Column4 in the input has three 0s (row0,4,6). So replacement is3. Similarly, row0, column8: column8 has one 0 (row0's input). But output is3. Wait, this doesn't fit. So earlier idea that the replacement is the number of 0s in the column seems to work for column4 but not for column8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is the number of 0s in the row. For row0's input, there are two 0s. Output uses3. No. Row1's input has two 0s, output uses1. No. Row2's input has four 0s, output uses1s and a2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the replacement number is the sum of the row index and column index. For example, row0, column4: 0+4=4. But output is3. Row0, column8:0+8=8. Output is3. Not matching. Modulo something? 4 mod4=0, 8 mod4=0. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is the row index. For row0's 0s: replacement3. row0's index is0. Doesn't fit. row1's 0s replaced with1, row index1. Maybe. row2's 0s replaced with1 and2. row index2. No.\n\nWait, in Example0's output row3: the zeros are at column2 and7. The replacements are3 and1. How does that fit? Input row3: [5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0]. So three 0s: columns2,7,9. Wait, output is [5,5,3,5,5,5,5,1,5,2]. So the 0 at column2 becomes3, column7 becomes1, column9 becomes2. How?\n\nLooking at column2 in the input for Example0. Let's count the number of 0s in column2 across all rows:\n\nRow0:5.\n\nRow1:5.\n\nRow2:5.\n\nRow3:0.\n\nRow4:5.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:5.\n\nRow7:5.\n\nRow8:5.\n\nRow9:5.\n\nSo column2 has two 0s (row3 and5). So replacement is2, but output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is the number of 0s in the row multiplied by some factor. For example, row0 has two 0s, but output is3. Row3 has three 0s (input), output is3,1,2. Sum is6. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the replacement number is the number of 5s adjacent to the 0. For example, a 0 surrounded by two 5s would have replacement2. Let's check:\n\nRow0, column4: neighbors are5 (left) and5 (right). So two 5s. Replacement is3. No. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, sum of adjacent 5s. For example, a 0 with two 5s next to it would sum to2, but replacement is3.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's look for another pattern. Maybe the replacement is based on the 0's position in the entire grid, treated as a single sequence. For example, the first 0 in row0, column4 is replaced by3. The next 0 in row0, column8 is replaced by3. Then row1's first two 0s are replaced by1. Maybe the replacement is the count of how many 0s have been encountered so far in the grid, modulo 3 plus1. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number increments each time a 0 is encountered. Like first 0 \u21921, second \u21922, third \u21923, fourth \u21921 again. But in Example0's output, the first two 0s in row0 are replaced by3, which would suggest this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is based on the parity of the row and column. For example, even rows and columns get certain numbers. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output row3: [5,5,3,5,5,5,5,1,5,2]. The original input has 0s at columns2,7,9. Output is3,1,2. So for column2:3, column7:1, column9:2. What's special about these columns? \n\nColumn2 in the entire input of Example0:\n\nRow0:5.\n\nRow1:5.\n\nRow2:5.\n\nRow3:0.\n\nRow4:5.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:5.\n\nRow7:5.\n\nRow8:5.\n\nRow9:5.\n\nSo two 0s. Replacement is3. No.\n\nColumn7 in input of Example0:\n\nRow0:5.\n\nRow1:5.\n\nRow2:0.\n\nRow3:0.\n\nRow4:5.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:5.\n\nRow7:5.\n\nRow8:5.\n\nRow9:0.\n\nSo four 0s. Replacement is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nColumn9 in input:\n\nRow0:5.\n\nRow1:5.\n\nRow2:0.\n\nRow3:0.\n\nRow4:5.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:0.\n\nRow7:5.\n\nRow8:0.\n\nRow9:0.\n\nSix 0s. Replacement is2. Hmm. 6 mod3=0, but replacement is2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is the number of times that particular column has appeared as a zero in previous rows. For example, in row3's column2 (0), how many zeros were in column2 before row3. Prior to row3, rows0-2 have column2 as5,5,5. So zero. So replacement is0, but output is3. Not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another angle. Maybe the replacement number is the number of 0s in the same diagonal as the current 0. But that would require checking diagonals, which might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number is the number of 0s in the same row up to that point. For example, in row0's first 0 (position4), there are no previous 0s. Replacement is3. Second 0 (position8) is the second in the row. Replacement is3. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0's output, the replacements are 1,2,3, and these numbers seem to appear in certain positions. For example, the first row of output has 3s, the second has1s, third has1s and a2, etc. Maybe there's a pattern where each 0 is replaced by the number of 0s in the same position in previous rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is based on the number of 0s in the same group (contiguous 0s) in the entire grid. For example, if a 0 is part of a group of three 0s, it becomes3. But looking at Example0's input, there's no group of three contiguous 0s. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement is the count of 0s in the same row and column. For example, each 0's replacement is the sum of the number of 0s in its row and the number of 0s in its column. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's row0, column4: row has2 0s, column4 has3 0s. Sum is5. Output is3. No. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compare the input and output for each example's entire grid. For example, in Example0's input, the 0s are replaced with numbers. Let's see if these numbers form any pattern. For instance, in the output of Example0, the first row's 0s are replaced by3. The fourth row's 0s (positions4 and5) are replaced by2 and2. Maybe the numbers are based on the column group. For example, columns0-3 are group0, 4-7 group1, 8-9 group2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is the number of 5s between the current 0 and the next 0 in the same row. For example, in row0's input, the first 0 is at4, next is8. Between them are three 5s (positions5,6,7). So replacement is3. That fits. Then in row0's output, both 0s are replaced by3. Let's check another example.\n\nExample0's row2: input [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0]. The first 0 is at0. Next 0 is6. Between them are five 5s (positions1-5). So replacement would be5. But output is1. Doesn't fit. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nAnother thought: The replacement number is the number of 0s in the same row that are to the right of the current 0. For row0's first 0 (position4), there's one 0 to the right (position8). So replacement is1. But output is3. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 0s in the same column that are below the current 0. For row0's column4, there are two 0s below (rows4 and6). So replacement is2. But output is3. No.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of 0s below and including the current. For row0's column4, it's three (including itself). So3. Output is3. That matches. Let's check another.\n\nIn row1's column0 (Example0's input), the 0 is replaced by1. How many 0s are below including current in column0?\n\nRow1, column0:0.\n\nLooking at rows1-9 in column0:\n\nRow2:0.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:0.\n\nRow9:0.\n\nSo total five 0s. But output is1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this works for row0's column4 but not for row1's column0.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's think differently. Maybe the replacement number is determined by the count of 0s in the same diagonal. For example, for a 0 at (row, col), count how many 0s are in the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right. For row0, col4, the diagonal would be (0,4), (1,5), (2,6), etc. Let's see if those have 0s.\n\nExample0's input:\n\nRow0, col4:0.\n\nRow1, col5:5.\n\nRow2, col6:0.\n\nRow3, col7:0.\n\nRow4, col8:5.\n\nSo in this diagonal, there are three 0s. Replacement is3. That matches. \n\nThen row0, col8's diagonal would be (0,8), (1,9). Row0, col8 is0. Row1, col9 is5. So only one 0. But output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother diagonal for row1, col0: (1,0) \u2192 (2,1), (3,2), etc. Row1, col0:0. Row2, col1:5. Row3, col2:0. Row4, col3:5. Row5, col4:5. Row6, col5:0. Row7, col6:5. Row8, col7:5. Row9, col8:5. So in this diagonal, zeros at (1,0), (3,2), (6,5). Three 0s. Replacement is1. But output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This seems inconsistent. But in row0, col4, the diagonal has three 0s, output3. But row1, col0's diagonal has three 0s, output1.\n\nThis is not consistent. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is the number of 0s in the cross (same row and column). For row0, col4: 2 (row) +3 (column) =5. Not 3.\n\nAnother idea: The replacement number is the sum of the number of 0s in the row and column, modulo3 plus1. For row0, col4: row has2, column has3. Sum5 \u21925 mod3=2 \u21922+1=3. Which matches the output3. For row1, col0: row has2, column has5. Sum7 \u21927 mod3=1 \u21921+1=2. But output is1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut let's test another example. Example0's row3, col2:0. Input row3 has three 0s. Column2 has two 0s. Sum5 \u21925 mod3=2 \u21922+1=3. Output is3. That matches. Row3, col7:0. Row has three 0s. Column7 has four 0s. Sum7 \u21927 mod3=1 \u21921+1=2. But output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe I need to step back and look for a simpler pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs again, I notice that the replacement numbers are 1, 2, or3. Could this be related to the number of non-zero elements (5s) between the 0 and the edges of the row? For example, for a 0 in the middle, how many 5s are to the left and right.\n\nFor row0, col4: left has four 5s, right has three 5s before next 0. Total7. But replacement is3. Maybe the minimum of left and right. For row0, col4: left is4, right is3. Min is3. Replacement3. That matches. For row0, col8: left has eight 5s (since previous 0 is at col4), so left count is3 (from col5 to 8: 5,5,5,5 \u2192 four 5s). Wait, no. For col8 in row0, the 0 is at index8. To the left, after the previous 0 (index4), there are 5s from index5 to7: three 5s. So left count is3. To the right, only index9:5. So min(3,1) \u21921. But output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut for row0, col4: left has four 5s (indices0-3), right has three 5s (indices5-7). Min is3 \u2192 replacement3. That works. For row0, col8: left has three 5s (indices5-7), right has one 5 (index9). Min is1 \u2192 replacement1. But output is3. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother possibility: the sum of the number of 5s to the left and right. For row0, col4: left4 + right3=7. Mod3 is1. Plus1 would give2, but output is3.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a pattern between input and output in terms of the positions of the 0s and the replacement numbers.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nRow0: 0s replaced with3.\n\nRow1: 0s replaced with1.\n\nRow2: 0s replaced with1 and2.\n\nRow3: replaced with3,1,2.\n\nRow4: replaced with2.\n\nRow5: replaced with2,3,2.\n\nRow6: replaced with2.\n\nRow7: no 0s.\n\nRow8: replaced with2.\n\nRow9: replaced with3,2.\n\nIs there a pattern where the replacement number increases as you move down the rows? Like, first few rows use3, then later rows use2, then1. Not exactly. Row0 uses3, row1 uses1, row2 uses1 and2, row3 uses3,1,2.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number depends on the row's position modulo3. Row0 (0 mod3) uses3. Row1 (1 mod3) uses1. Row2 (2 mod3) uses1,2. But row3 (0 mod3) uses3,1,2. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the test input and see if we can spot a pattern there, but the problem is we need to apply the same pattern as the training examples.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5]\n[5,5,5,0,5,5,0,5,0,5]\n[5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5]\n[5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n[0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n[0,5,5,0,5,5,0,5,0,0]\n[5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5]\n[5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0]\n[0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0]\n\nExpected output: need to apply the pattern.\n\nBut without knowing the pattern, this is hard. Maybe the replacement number is the count of 0s in the column of the entire input. For example, in the test input, for each 0, count how many 0s are in its column across all rows of the test input. Let's try this.\n\nTest input has 10 rows. Let's count for each column:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRow0:0.\n\nRow1:5.\n\nRow2:5.\n\nRow3:5.\n\nRow4:0.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:5.\n\nRow7:5.\n\nRow8:0.\n\nRow9:5.\n\nTotal 0s: rows0,4,5,8 \u21924.\n\nSo any 0 in column0 would be replaced by4. But in the training examples, the replacement numbers are up to3. So maybe this is not the case. But perhaps the replacement is (number of 0s in the column) mod3 +1. For column0:4 \u21924 mod3=1 \u21921+1=2. So replacement is2.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0:5.\n\nRow1:5.\n\nRow2:5.\n\nRow3:0.\n\nRow4:5.\n\nRow5:5.\n\nRow6:5.\n\nRow7:5.\n\nRow8:0.\n\nRow9:5.\n\n0s in rows3,8 \u21922. 2 mod3=2 \u21922+1=3. So replacement3.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0:5.\n\nRow1:5.\n\nRow2:0.\n\nRow3:0.\n\nRow4:5.\n\nRow5:5.\n\nRow6:0.\n\nRow7:0.\n\nRow8:5.\n\nRow9:5.\n\n0s in rows2,3,6,7 \u21924. 4 mod3=1 \u21921+1=2. Replacement2.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0:5.\n\nRow1:0.\n\nRow2:5.\n\nRow3:5.\n\nRow4:5.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:5.\n\nRow7:5.\n\nRow8:5.\n\nRow9:5.\n\n0s in row1,5 \u21922. 2 mod3=2 \u21922+1=3. Replacement3.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0:5.\n\nRow1:5.\n\nRow2:5.\n\nRow3:5.\n\nRow4:5.\n\nRow5:5.\n\nRow6:5.\n\nRow7:5.\n\nRow8:5.\n\nRow9:0.\n\n0s in row9 \u21921. Replacement1+1=2.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0:5.\n\nRow1:5.\n\nRow2:5.\n\nRow3:5.\n\nRow4:5.\n\nRow5:5.\n\nRow6:5.\n\nRow7:5.\n\nRow8:5.\n\nRow9:5.\n\nNo 0s. So replacement 0. But no 0s in this column.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow0:0.\n\nRow1:0.\n\nRow2:5.\n\nRow3:5.\n\nRow4:0.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:5.\n\nRow7:5.\n\nRow8:0.\n\nRow9:0.\n\n0s in rows0,1,4,5,8,9 \u21926. 6 mod3=0 \u21920+1=1. Replacement1.\n\nColumn7:\n\nRow0:0.\n\nRow1:5.\n\nRow2:5.\n\nRow3:5.\n\nRow4:5.\n\nRow5:5.\n\nRow6:5.\n\nRow7:5.\n\nRow8:5.\n\nRow9:0.\n\n0s in rows0,9 \u21922. 2 mod3=2 \u21922+1=3. Replacement3.\n\nColumn8:\n\nRow0:5.\n\nRow1:0.\n\nRow2:0.\n\nRow3:5.\n\nRow4:5.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:0.\n\nRow7:5.\n\nRow8:5.\n\nRow9:5.\n\n0s in rows1,2,5,6 \u21924. 4 mod3=1 \u21921+1=2. Replacement2.\n\nColumn9:\n\nRow0:5.\n\nRow1:5.\n\nRow2:5.\n\nRow3:5.\n\nRow4:5.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:5.\n\nRow7:0.\n\nRow8:5.\n\nRow9:0.\n\n0s in rows5,7,9 \u21923. 3 mod3=0 \u21920+1=1. Replacement1.\n\nIf this is the pattern, then each 0 is replaced by (number of 0s in the column) mod3 +1. Let's check with the training examples.\n\nTake Example0's row0, column4: column4 has3 zeros. 3 mod3=0 \u21920+1=1. But output is3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this pattern doesn't hold for the training examples. \n\nAlternative idea: The replacement number is the number of 0s in the column, but in the training examples, the column counts are different. For example, in Example0's row0, column4 has3 zeros. Replacement3. That fits. So if the replacement is the number of zeros in the column, then in Example0:\n\nRow0, column4 \u21923 zeros \u2192 replacement3.\n\nRow1, column0 and1 \u2192 columns0 has5 zeros, column1 has2 zeros. But in output, they are replaced by1 and1. This contradicts.\n\nSo this only fits some cases. Not the pattern.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps the pattern is that each 0 is replaced by the number of 0s in its row multiplied by the number of 0s in its column, then modulo3 plus1. For Example0's row0, column4: row0 has2 zeros, column4 has3. 2*3=6 \u21926 mod3=0 \u21920+1=1. But output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, row zeros plus column zeros. For Example0 row0, column4: 2+3=5 \u21925 mod3=2 \u21922+1=3. Which matches output3. Let's check another case.\n\nExample0 row1, column0: row1 has2 zeros, column0 has5 zeros. 2+5=7 \u21927 mod3=1 \u21921+1=2. But output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother example, Example0 row3, column2: row3 has3 zeros, column2 has2 zeros. 3+2=5 \u21925 mod3=2 \u21922+1=3. Output is3. Matches. row3, column7: row3 has3, column7 has4. 3+4=7 mod3=1 \u21921+1=2. Output is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo inconsistent.\n\nI think I'm going around in circles here. Let's try to find a different approach. \n\nLooking at Example0's output, the replacements seem to be following a pattern where the numbers increase as you move down the rows. For example, in Example0's outputs:\n\nRow0: 3.\n\nRow1:1.\n\nRow2:1 and2.\n\nRow3:3,1,2.\n\nRow4:2.\n\nRow5:2,3,2.\n\nRow6:2.\n\nRow7: no zeros.\n\nRow8:2.\n\nRow9:3 and2.\n\nSo there's a mixture of 1,2,3. Maybe the replacement number is based on the row index modulo3. For example:\n\nRow0 (index0): 0 mod3=0 \u21923.\n\nRow1:1 mod3=1 \u21921.\n\nRow2:2 mod3=2 \u21922.\n\nRow3:3 mod3=0 \u21923.\n\nRow4:4 mod3=1 \u21921.\n\nRow5:5 mod3=2 \u21922.\n\nRow6:6 mod3=0 \u21923.\n\nRow7: no zeros.\n\nRow8:8 mod3=2 \u21922.\n\nRow9:9 mod3=0 \u21923.\n\nBut the outputs don't follow this. For example, row3's output has3,1,2. But according to this, row3's replacement should be3. But the 0s are replaced with3,1,2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the replacement number is determined by the number of 0s in the same row and the same column. For example, the product of the row count and column count.\n\nFor Example0's row0, column4: row0 has2 zeros, column4 has3 zeros. 2*3=6 \u21926 mod3=0 \u21920+1=1. Output is3. No.\n\nThis is really difficult. Let me look at the test input and try to see if I can find a pattern there. \n\nTest input row0: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5]. The zeros are at positions0,6,7. Let's assume the replacement is based on the column's zero count.\n\nFor column0 in test input: 4 zeros (rows0,4,5,8). So replacement is4 mod3=1 \u21921+1=2.\n\nFor column6:6 zeros \u21926 mod3=0 \u21920+1=1.\n\nFor column7:2 zeros \u21922 mod3=2 \u21922+1=3.\n\nSo replacement numbers would be2,1,1. But I'm not sure. If this were the case, then the output for row0 would be [2,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5]. But let's compare with the training examples. For example, in Example0's row0, column4 had3 zeros, replaced by3. So maybe the replacement is simply the count of zeros in the column. For column0 in test input, 4 zeros \u2192 replacement4. But training examples have replacements up to3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is the count of zeros in the column modulo3. For column0:4 mod3=1 \u21921. But in Example0's column4, which had3 zeros, replacement3 mod3=0 \u21920. Doesn't match.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let's consider that each 0 is replaced by the number of 5s between it and the nearest edge, but this doesn't fit previous examples.\n\nAlternatively, think of the replacement number as the number of 0s in the same diagonal, but this also doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: The replacement number is the number of 0s in the same quadrant. For example, split the grid into quadrants. For example, top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right. Each quadrant's replacement number is the count of 0s in that quadrant. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is the number of 0s in the same 3x3 block as the current 0. But this also seems complex and may not fit.\n\nAt this point, after trying many hypotheses and not finding a clear pattern, I think the best guess is that the replacement number is the number of 0s in the same column of the entire input grid. \n\nFor the test input:\n\nLet's count the number of zeros in each column:\n\nColumn0: rows0,4,5,8 \u21924 zeros.\n\nColumn1: rows3,8 \u21922 zeros.\n\nColumn2: rows2,3,6,7 \u21924 zeros.\n\nColumn3: rows1,5 \u21922 zeros.\n\nColumn4: row9 \u21921 zero.\n\nColumn5: none.\n\nColumn6: rows0,1,4,5,8,9 \u21926 zeros.\n\nColumn7: rows0,9 \u21922 zeros.\n\nColumn8: rows1,2,5,6 \u21924 zeros.\n\nColumn9: rows5,7,9 \u21923 zeros.\n\nSo if the replacement number is the number of zeros in the column:\n\nRow0's 0s are at columns0,6,7 \u21924,6,2 \u2192 replacements would be4,6,2. But since the training examples use 1,2,3, perhaps we take modulo3 and add1.\n\n4 mod3=1 \u21921+1=2.\n\n6 mod3=0 \u21920+1=1.\n\n2 mod3=2 \u21922+1=3.\n\nSo replacements would be2,1,3.\n\nBut in Example0's row0, the column4 had3 zeros, so 3 mod3=0 \u21920+1=1. But the output was3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is the count of zeros in the column.\n\nSo column0:4 \u2192 replacement4. But in training examples, the highest was3. So this seems unlikely.\n\nGiven that I can't find a clear pattern, but in the training examples, each 0 is replaced by a number that sometimes equals the column's zero count (like column4 in Example0's row0, which had3 zeros replaced by3), I will proceed with this assumption, even though it doesn't fit all cases.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFor each 0 in the test input, replace it with the number of zeros in its column.\n\nSo:\n\nTest input row0: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5]\n\n0 at column0 \u21924 zeros \u21924. But in training examples, the output numbers are 1,2,3. So perhaps modulo3, 4 mod3=1. So replacement1+1=2.\n\n0 at column6 \u21926 zeros \u21926 mod3=0 \u21920+1=1.\n\n0 at column7 \u21922 zeros \u21922 mod3=2 \u21922+1=3.\n\nSo row0's output would be [2,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, sometimes the column zero count is used directly. For example, column4 in Example0's row0 had3 zeros, replaced by3. So perhaps no modulo. But test input has columns with 4 zeros. So this would make replacements higher than3, which training examples don't have. So this is invalid.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck and time is limited, perhaps the correct pattern is that the replacement number is the count of zeros in the same column, but limited to 3. So if column has more than3 zeros, use3. But this is a guess.\n\nIn test input column6 has6 zeros \u2192 replacement3.\n\nColumn0:4 zeros \u21923.\n\nColumn2:4 zeros \u21923.\n\nColumn8:4 zeros \u21923.\n\nColumn9:3 \u21923.\n\nSo:\n\nTest input row0:0s at columns0,6,7.\n\nColumn0:4 \u21923.\n\nColumn6:6 \u21923.\n\nColumn7:2 \u21922.\n\nSo output would be [3,5,5,5,5,5,3,2,5,5].\n\nBut in the training examples, the numbers can be 1,2,3, but no higher. But this is a guess.\n\nAnother possibility is that the replacement is the number of the column's zero count in binary, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is the number of zeros in the column divided by 2, rounded up. But this also doesn't fit.\n\nAfter exhausting all possibilities, I think the best approach is to conclude that each 0 is replaced by the number of zeros in its column, and in the training examples, columns have up to3 zeros. So in test input, columns have up to6 zeros, which would be replaced by 3 (if we cap at3). \n\nSo applying that, let's process the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [0 (column0),5,5,5,5,5,0 (column6),0 (column7),5,5]\n\nColumn0 has4 zeros \u2192 replacement3.\n\nColumn6 has6 \u21923.\n\nColumn7 has2 \u21922.\n\nSo row0 becomes [3,5,5,5,5,5,3,2,5,5].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, there are cases where column counts are higher than3. For example, in Example0's column7 has4 zeros, but the replacement is1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I can't find a valid pattern and time is limited, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the replacement number is the number of zeros in the column. For the test input, this would give:\n\nRow0: columns0 (4),6 (6),7 (2) \u21924,6,2. But training examples use up to3, so perhaps modulo3+1:\n\n4%3=1 \u21921+1=2.\n\n6%3=0 \u21920+1=1.\n\n2%3=2 \u21922+1=3.\n\nSo row0 becomes [2,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5].\n\nBut this is a guess. Given the time I've spent and lack of a clear pattern, this is the best I can do.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples and then apply that pattern to the test input. Let me start by carefully examining the training examples to identify any consistent rules.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nIn the input, there are 0s and 5s. The output replaces some 0s with numbers like 1, 2, 3. Hmm. Let's see if there's a positional pattern or a count-based replacement.\n\nFirst, maybe the 0s are replaced based on their position or the number of adjacent 5s. Wait, let's take the first row of Example 0:\n\nInput: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5]\nOutput: [5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,3,5]\n\nThe two 0s at positions 4 and 8 (0-based index) become 3s. Hmm. What's special about those positions? Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1's first input row:\n\nInput: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5]\nOutput: [5,5,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5]\n\nThe two 0s at positions 5 and 6 become 2s. So the replacement number isn't just the index. Maybe it's related to the number of 5s surrounding the 0? Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's first input row again. The 0 at position 4 (value 0) in the input. The surrounding elements would be the previous and next elements. Wait, but maybe it's looking at the number of consecutive 5s before and after the 0?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number replacing the 0 is the count of 5s adjacent to it. Let's check:\n\nFor the first 0 in Example 0's first input row (position 4), the elements to the left and right are 5 and 5. So two 5s adjacent. But the replacement is 3. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of 5s in the entire row. Wait, the first row in Example 0's input has 8 5s. The 0s become 3. But 8 isn't directly related to 3. Maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: the replacement number could represent the number of 0s in the same row. Let's see. Example 0's first input row has two 0s. They are replaced with 3 each. That doesn't add up. So perhaps that's not it.\n\nLooking at Example 0's second input row:\n\nInput: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\nOutput: [1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nThe two leading 0s become 1s. The rest are 5s. So maybe the replacement depends on the position of the 0 in the row. For instance, the first two 0s in a row become 1s. But in Example 0's third input row:\n\nInput: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0]\nOutput: [1,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,2]\n\nThe 0s are at positions 0,6,7,9. The first three 0s are replaced with 1s and the last with 2. So that contradicts the idea that the first two become 1s. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement number is the number of 0s before the current 0 in the row. Let's check. In Example 0's third input row, the first 0 (position 0) has 0 zeros before it, so replaced with 1? That doesn't align. The third 0 (position 7) would be the third zero in the row. But replaced with 1. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement number increments based on the order of 0s in the row. For example, the first 0 in the row becomes 1, the second 1, the third 2, etc. But in the first example's second input row, two 0s become 1s. So that would not fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output for the third row: the 0 at position 9 is replaced with 2. Let's count the zeros in the input row. There are four zeros. The replacements are 1,1,1,2. So the first three zeros become 1s, the last becomes 2. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each 0 is replaced by the number of 5s before it in the row. Let's check Example 0's first input row:\n\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5]\n\nThe first 0 is at position 4. The number of 5s before it is 4. The replacement is 3. Hmm, 4 vs 3. Not matching. The second 0 at position 8: number of 5s before it is 7 (since up to index 7, the elements are 5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5). So 7 5s before, replacement is 3. Doesn't align.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the number of 5s after the 0. For the first 0 in Example 0's first input row, after the 0 (position4), there are 5 elements: 5,5,5,0,5. So three 5s (positions5,6,7,9: wait, position4 is 0, then positions5 is 5, 6 is5,7 is5, 8 is0,9 is5. So after the first 0 (position4), there are 5s at 5,6,7,9. So four 5s. But the replacement is 3. Not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the replacement number is based on the number of 5s adjacent to the 0, but considering left and right. Let's take the first 0 in Example 0's first input row (position4). The left neighbor is 5 (position3), right neighbor is5 (position5). So two 5s. Replacement is 3. Doesn't match. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 5s in the entire row minus something. For Example 0's first input row, there are 8 5s. 8-5=3. The replacement is3. Maybe? Then the next 0 in that row (position8) has the same row count, so same replacement. That could fit. Let's check another example.\n\nTake Example0's second input row: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]. There are 8 5s. 8-5=3, but the 0s here are replaced with 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the replacement is based on the number of 5s in the same column as the 0. Because each input is a list of rows, so perhaps each row is part of a 2D grid. Let's think of the input as a 10x10 grid (since each list has 10 elements and there are 10 rows in each example). So each 0 in the grid is replaced by a number that's based on something related to its position in the grid.\n\nFor example, in Example0's first input row, the 0 at position (0,4) (assuming rows are 0-indexed and columns are 0-9). Let's check the column for that 0. Looking at all the rows in the input for Example0, column4:\n\nRow0: 0 (input)\nRow1:5\nRow2:5\nRow3:5\nRow4:0\nRow5:5\nRow6:0\nRow7:5\nRow8:5\nRow9:5\n\nSo column4 has 0,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,5. So in column4, there are three 0s. The replacement for the 0 in row0, column4 is 3. That matches the replacement value. Let's check another example.\n\nIn Example0's second input row, the first two elements are 0s (columns0 and1). Let's look at column0 in all rows for Example0's input:\n\nRow0:5\nRow1:0\nRow2:0\nRow3:5\nRow4:5\nRow5:0\nRow6:0\nRow7:5\nRow8:5\nRow9:0\n\nSo column0 has 5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0. That's 5 zeros. The 0s in row1, column0 and column1 (columns0 and1) are replaced with 1s. Wait, the number of zeros in column0 is 5. Hmm, but replacement is 1. So that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is the number of 0s in the same column. But for row0, column4 (Example0), column4 has three 0s, replacement is3. That fits. For row1, column0 (Example0), column0 has 5 zeros (rows1,2,5,6,9). Replacement is1. Doesn't fit. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the replacement number is the number of 0s in the entire grid that are to the left of the current 0 in their respective rows. For example, in a row, each 0's replacement is the count of 0s before it (including itself) in that row. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's first input row: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5]. The first 0 is at position4. It's the first 0 in the row, so replacement 1. But output is 3. So no. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement is the number of 0s in the same row before the current 0, plus 1. So first 0 in a row becomes 1, second becomes2, etc. Let's check Example0's first input row. The two 0s are the first and second in the row, so replaced with1 and2. But in the output, they are replaced with3 and3. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother idea: Look at the output numbers. In Example0's output, the replacement numbers are 1,2,3. Maybe these represent the number of surrounding 5s in the grid (like Moore neighborhood). For example, a 0 that is surrounded by 3 5s would be replaced by 3.\n\nLet's take the first 0 in Example0's first input row (row0, column4). Let's check the 8 adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and diagonals). But since this is the first row (row0), up isn't possible. So adjacent cells are left (column3:5), right (column5:5), down (row1, column4:5). Diagonals: row1, column3 (5), row1, column5 (5). So total of 5 adjacent 5s. But replacement is3. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, only immediate left and right in the same row. For row0, column4: left is5, right is5. So two 5s. Replacement is3. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the sum of the left and right 5s in the same row. But 5+5=10, which is not 3. So that's not it.\n\nLet me look for another pattern. Maybe the replacement number is the number of 5s in the entire row minus the position of the 0. For example, in the first input row of Example0: 8 5s. The first 0 is at position4 (0-based). 8 -4=4. Not 3. Next 0 at position8: 8-8=0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the row's 5 count minus the number of 0s in the row. For Example0's first row, 8 5s and 2 0s. 8-2=6. Not related to 3.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement number is the number of 0s in the same column. For Example0, first 0 is in column4. Let's count how many 0s are in column4 across all rows. Looking at Example0's input:\n\nRow0, column4:0\n\nRow1, column4:5\n\nRow2, column4:5\n\nRow3, column4:5\n\nRow4, column4:0\n\nRow5, column4:5\n\nRow6, column4:0\n\nRow7, column4:5\n\nRow8, column4:5\n\nRow9, column4:5\n\nSo column4 has three 0s (rows0,4,6). So the replacement is3. That matches. Let's check another example.\n\nTake Example0's second input row: first two elements are 0s (columns0 and1). Let's check column0 in the input for Example0:\n\nRow0, column0:5\n\nRow1, column0:0\n\nRow2, column0:0\n\nRow3, column0:5\n\nRow4, column0:5\n\nRow5, column0:0\n\nRow6, column0:0\n\nRow7, column0:5\n\nRow8, column0:5\n\nRow9, column0:0\n\nSo column0 has 0s in rows1,2,5,6,9. Five 0s. The first 0 in row1, column0 would be replaced with5, but in the output, it's replaced with1. So that doesn't fit. Hmm. So the initial hypothesis about column count is correct for some cases but not others.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement is the count of 0s in the column, but starting from the row of the current 0 and counting upwards (all rows above it, including itself). For example, in Example0's first 0 (row0, column4), column4 has three 0s (rows0,4,6). The replacement is3. For row1's column0 (which is0), column0 has five 0s. But in the output, it's replaced with1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is the number of 0s in the column up to and including the current row. For row0, column4: there's one 0 (row0), so replacement1. But output is3. So no.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the output numbers and see if they relate to the positions of the 0s in the entire grid. For instance, the first 0 in Example0's first row (row0, column4) is replaced with3. Maybe it's the number of 0s encountered before this one in a certain order, like row-wise. But the first 0 in the entire grid would be at row0, column4, but the output is3, which might not align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement number is the sum of the indices of the 0's row and column. For row0, column4: 0+4=4. Not3. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example0's third input row:\n\nInput: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0]\nOutput: [1,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,2]\n\nThe zeros are at positions0,6,7,9. The replacements are1,1,1,2. So the first three zeros are replaced with1, the last with2. Maybe the replacement increments after a certain number of zeros in the row. Like, after three zeros, the fourth becomes2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the number of 0s in the row. For this row, there are four zeros. So maybe the replacement is the count of zeros in the row. But the replacements are1,1,1,2, which adds up to5, not4. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's look at another example. Example1's first input row:\n\nInput: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5]\nOutput: [5,5,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5]\n\nThe two 0s are replaced with2 each. The column for these 0s is5 and6. Let's check column5 in all rows of Example1's input. How many zeros are there in column5? Let's see:\n\nRow0, column5:0\n\nRow1, column5:5\n\nRow2, column5:0\n\nRow3, column5:0\n\nRow4, column5:5\n\nRow5, column5:5\n\nRow6, column5:5\n\nRow7, column5:5\n\nRow8, column5:5\n\nRow9, column5:5\n\nSo column5 has three 0s (rows0,2,3). But the replacement is2. So that doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's consider that each 0 in the input is replaced by a number that indicates how many times a certain condition is met. For example, maybe the number of adjacent 5s in all directions (including up and down if within the grid) for each 0.\n\nTake the first 0 in Example0's first row (row0, column4). Let's see the neighboring cells:\n\nLeft: column3, row0:5\n\nRight: column5, row0:5\n\nUp: row-1 (invalid, so ignore)\n\nDown: row1, column4:5\n\nDiagonally up-left: invalid.\n\nDiagonally up-right: invalid.\n\nDiagonally down-left: row1, column3:5 (assuming input row1 is [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5], so column3 is5.\n\nDiagonally down-right: row1, column5:5.\n\nSo total of 5 neighboring 5s (left, right, down, down-left, down-right). But replacement is3. So that doesn't match. So maybe it's the count of adjacent 5s in the same row. Left and right: two 5s. Replacement is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement is the number of consecutive 5s before and after the 0 in the same row. For example, in Example0's first row, the 0 at position4 is between four 5s before and three 5s after. So maybe 4+3=7. But replacement is3. No.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the replacement number is the number of 0s in the same row. For Example0's first row, two 0s. Replacement numbers are3 and3. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 0s in the same column. For the first 0 in Example0's first row (column4), the column has three 0s. Replacement is3. That works. For the 0 in row1, column0 (Example0), the column0 has five 0s. Replacement is1. Doesn't fit. Wait, but in Example0's second input row, the first two zeros are in columns0 and1. Let's check column0. How many 0s are in column0 across all rows in Example0's input?\n\nLooking at each row of Example0's input:\n\nRow0:5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5 \u2192 column0 is5.\n\nRow1:0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5 \u2192 column0 is0.\n\nRow2:0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0 \u2192 column0 is0.\n\nRow3:5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0 \u2192 column0 is5.\n\nRow4:5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5 \u2192 column0 is5.\n\nRow5:0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0 \u2192 column0 is0.\n\nRow6:0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0 \u2192 column0 is0.\n\nRow7:5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5 \u2192 column0 is5.\n\nRow8:5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0 \u2192 column0 is5.\n\nRow9:0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0 \u2192 column0 is0.\n\nSo column0 has 0s in rows1,2,5,6,9 \u2192 total of five 0s. But in row1's column0, the output is1. So five 0s in the column, but replacement is1. So this hypothesis doesn't hold.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement is the number of 0s in the same column that are below (including the current row) the current 0. For example, in Example0's first 0 (row0, column4), the column has three 0s (rows0,4,6). So replacement is3. That works. For row1, column0 (Example0's second row), the 0 is in row1. The number of 0s in column0 from row1 downwards would be rows1,2,5,6,9 \u2192 five 0s. But replacement is1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a pattern in the output numbers. In the training examples, the replacements are 1,2,3. Maybe these numbers correspond to the number of 0s in the same diagonal or some other structural pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 0 is replaced by the number of times it is enclosed by 5s in certain directions. For example, if a 0 is between two 5s in the same row, it's replaced with1, if between three 5s, replaced with2, etc. But Example0's first row has a 0 between four 5s on the left and three on the right. The replacement is3. Maybe the sum of the consecutive 5s on both sides. 4+3=7. No.\n\nAlternatively, the minimum of the left and right consecutive 5s. For the first 0 in Example0's first row, left has4, right has3. Minimum is3. Replacement is3. That fits. Let's check another example.\n\nTake Example0's third input row: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0]. The first 0 (position0) has no left side, so left consecutive 5s are0. Right side has5,5,5,5,5. So five consecutive 5s. Minimum is0. Replacement is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So that theory doesn't hold.\n\nAnother angle: Let's consider that the replacement number is the count of 5s in the same row up to the 0. For example, in Example0's first row, the first 0 is at position4. The count of 5s before it is4. Replacement is3. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the count of 5s after the 0. For the first 0 in Example0's first row, after the 0 there are5,5,5,0,5 \u2192 four 5s. Replacement is3. No.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement number is the number of 0s in the entire input grid. For Example0's first 0, maybe there are three 0s so far. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number is the number of 5s in the same row that are after the 0. For Example0's first row, after the first 0, there are 5,5,5,0,5. So three 5s before the next 0. Replacement is3. That matches. Let's check the next 0 in that row (position8). After it, there's5. So one 5. Replacement is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nMaybe the replacement is based on the number of 5s in the same row before the 0. For the first 0 in Example0's first row, there are four 5s before. Replacement is3. Not matching. The second 0 in that row has seven 5s before (indices0-7). Replacement is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nLet me look at another example. Take Example2's first input row:\n\nInput: [0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5]\nOutput: [2,2,5,5,3,5,5,5,1,5]\n\nThe first two 0s are replaced with2, then the third 0 with3, the fourth with1. \n\nHmm. Looking at the columns for these 0s:\n\nFirst 0 is row0, column0. Let's check how many 0s are in column0 across all rows in Example2's input. Let me count:\n\nLooking at Example2's input rows:\n\nRow0:0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5 \u2192 column0:0\n\nRow1:5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5 \u2192 column0:5\n\nRow2:5,0,5,0,5,0,5,5,0,5 \u2192 column0:5\n\nRow3:5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5 \u2192 column0:5\n\nRow4:5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,0 \u2192 column0:5\n\nRow5:5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0 \u2192 column0:5\n\nRow6:5,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5 \u2192 column0:5\n\nRow7:5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5 \u2192 column0:5\n\nRow8:5,0,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,5 \u2192 column0:5\n\nRow9:5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5 \u2192 column0:5\n\nSo column0 has only one 0 (row0). So replacement is2. But according to the output, the first two 0s in row0 are replaced with2. So column count doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the number of 0s in the same row to the left of the current 0. For the first 0 in row0 of Example2's input, there are no 0s to the left (it's the first element). Replacement is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at Example0's output, the replacement numbers are 1, 2, 3. Maybe these numbers are related to the position of the 0 in a certain sequence. For example, the first 0 in the entire grid is replaced with1, the second with2, and so on, resetting for each row or column. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nRow0 has two 0s \u2192 replaced with3 and3.\n\nRow1 has two 0s \u2192 replaced with1 and1.\n\nRow2 has four 0s \u2192 replaced with1,1,1,2.\n\nRow3 has two 0s \u21923 and2.\n\nRow4 has two 0s \u21922 and2.\n\nRow5 has three 0s \u21922,3,2.\n\nRow6 has three 0s \u21922,2,2.\n\nRow7 has no 0s.\n\nRow8 has one 0 \u21922.\n\nRow9 has three 0s \u21923,3,2.\n\nSo the replacements don't follow a global sequence. For instance, the first 0 in row0 is replaced with3, which would be the first in the grid, but 3 is higher than others. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The replacement number is the number of 5s in the same row divided by some factor. For Example0's first row, 8 5s \u2192 8/ something. 8/2=4, but replacement is3. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is the number of 5s in the same row minus the number of 0s. For Example0's first row:8-2=6. Not3.\n\nThis is frustrating. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's consider that the replacement number is the number of non-zero (i.e., 5) elements in the same row before the first 0. For example, in Example0's first row, before the first 0 (position4), there are four 5s. Replacement is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 0s in the same column after the current 0. For example, in Example0's first 0 (row0, column4), column4 has two more 0s below it (rows4 and6). So total of two after. Replacement is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of 0s before and after in the column. For Example0's first 0, column4 has two 0s below it. So sum of 1 (itself) plus two below \u21923. Replacement is3. That fits. Let's check another case.\n\nTake row1, column0 in Example0's input. This 0 is in row1, column0. How many 0s are in column0 after row1? Let's see:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow9:0\n\nSo after row1 (including row1), there are five 0s. So sum would be5. But replacement is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. No.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each 0 is replaced by the number of steps to the nearest 5 in a certain direction. For example, in Example0's first row, the 0 at position4 has a 5 to the left (position3) and right (position5). The steps to the nearest 5 on each side is1. So maybe sum left and right steps. 1+1=2. Replacement is3. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the minimum of the left and right steps. Which is1. Replacement is3. No.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look for a pattern in the output where each replacement is the count of how many 5s are present in the same row starting from the first 5 after the 0. For example, in Example0's first row, after the first 0, there are three 5s before the next 0. So replacement3. That matches. Then the next 0 has one 5 after. So replacement1. But the output for the next 0 is3. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 5s between this 0 and the next 0. For Example0's first row, the first 0 is at4, next 0 is at8. Between them are positions5,6,7: three 5s. Replacement3. That fits. Then between 8 and end (no more 0s), there's one 5 (position9). Replacement3. No. So inconsistent.\n\nBut this might explain some cases. For Example0's third input row: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0]. The first 0 is at0, next 0 at6. Between them are five 5s. Replacement1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This isn't working.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the outputs. The numbers are 1, 2, 3. Maybe these are the counts of how many times a 0 appears in a certain position in the grid. For example, each row is transformed into a new row where each 0 is replaced by the number of times a 0 appears in that specific position (row and column) across all training examples. But that's unlikely since the training examples are separate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the number of 0s in the same row that are to the right of the current 0. For Example0's first row, the first 0 has one 0 to the right (position8). Replacement3. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 0s to the left in the same row. For the first 0 in Example0's first row, zero to the left. Replacement3. No.\n\nThis is challenging. Maybe I should consider that the replacement numbers are related to the positions of the 0s in their respective rows. For example, the index of the 0 within the row (first 0, second 0, etc.) plus some base.\n\nIn Example0's third input row, there are four 0s. The replacements are1,1,1,2. So perhaps the first three 0s are replaced with1, and the fourth with2. Maybe after three 0s, the replacement increments. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is the number of 0s in the row modulo some number. For four 0s, maybe modulo3 gives1, but the last 0 is2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is based on the position of the 0 in the row. For example, first 0 in the row is replaced with1, second with1, third with1, fourth with2. But that doesn't explain other examples.\n\nWait, looking at Example1's first input row, which has two 0s replaced with2. If the row has two 0s, both replaced with2. So maybe the number of 0s in the row determines the replacement. For two 0s, replacement is2. But in Example0's first row, two 0s are replaced with3. So that's not it.\n\nAnother thought: The replacement number might be the number of 0s in the entire grid. For Example0's input, there are multiple 0s. Let's count:\n\nRow0:2\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:4\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:2\n\nRow5:3\n\nRow6:3\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow9:3\n\nTotal 0s:2+2+4+2+2+3+3+0+1+3=22. But the replacements are 1,2,3. So not directly related.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's try to think outside the box. Maybe each 0 is replaced by the number of 5s in the same diagonal. For example, the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) or other diagonals.\n\nTake Example0's first 0 at row0, column4. The diagonal elements would be positions where row - column is constant. For row0, column4: row - column = -4. So any cells with row - column = -4. But that's only row0, column4. So no other elements. So replacement3. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the anti-diagonal (row + column). For row0, column4: 0+4=4. So cells with row + column=4. These would be (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), etc. Let's count the 5s in these cells. In Example0's input:\n\n(0,4):0\n\n(1,3):5 (row1, column3 is5)\n\n(2,2):5 (row2, column2 is5)\n\n(3,1):5 (row3, column1 is5)\n\n(4,0):5 (row4, column0 is5)\n\nSo the 5s in this diagonal are four. The replacement is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 5s in the same row and column. For example, row0's 0 at column4: row0 has8 5s, column4 has three 0s. But how does that give3?\n\nMaybe the replacement is the sum of the row's 5 count and the column's 5 count. For row0, column4: row0 has8 5s, column4 has7 5s (since three 0s in column4 mean 10-3=7 5s). 8+7=15. Not3.\n\nThis is not working. Let's try to find a pattern in the outputs.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nThe first 0 in row0 is replaced with3. Looking at the other 3s in the output:\n\nRow0:3\n\nRow3:3\n\nRow5:3\n\nRow9:3\n\nHmm. What's common about these positions?\n\nRow0, column4 and 8.\n\nRow3, column2.\n\nRow5, columns0 and7.\n\nRow9, columns0 and7.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, 3s appear in certain columns. Columns4,8,2,0,7. No obvious pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the replacement number is the number of 0s in a certain square around the 0. For example, in a 3x3 grid centered on the 0, count the number of 0s. But that's complex and may vary.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is the number of 0s in the same row and the same column. For Example0's first 0 (row0, column4):\n\nRow0 has2 0s.\n\nColumn4 has3 0s.\n\nSum:5. Replacement3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, product:2*3=6. Replacement3. No.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's look at another example's output.\n\nIn Example1's output, the first row's two 0s are replaced with2. Let's check their column counts. For the first 0 in row0, column5 of Example1's input:\n\nLooking at column5 across all rows in Example1's input:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:5\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:5\n\nRow5:5\n\nRow6:5\n\nRow7:5\n\nRow8:5\n\nRow9:5\n\nSo column5 has three 0s (rows0,2,3). Replacement is2. So not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement is the number of 0s in the column minus something. For Example0's first 0: column4 has3 0s. 3-0=3. Replacement3. For Example1's first 0 (row0, column5):3-1=2. Maybe minus the row index divided by something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the replacement is the number of 0s in the column minus the row number. For Example0's first 0: column4 has3 0s. 3-0=3. Replacement3. That fits. For Example1's first 0 (row0, column5):3-0=3. Replacement is2. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that each 0 in the input is replaced by the number of 0s in its own row multiplied by the number of 0s in its own column, modulo 4. For Example0's first 0: row has2 0s, column has3 0s. 2*3=6. 6 mod4=2. But replacement is3. So no.\n\nAlternatively, addition: 2+3=5. 5 mod4=1. Not3.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to think of the replacement numbers as being related to some kind of layers. For example, in a grid, the outermost layer (border) is layer1, next layer is layer2, etc. The replacement number is the layer number.\n\nFor Example0's first 0 (row0, column4). Row0 is the top layer. Column4 is in the middle. But the replacement is3. So if layers are counted from the center, maybe. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is the Manhattan distance from the nearest corner. For example, row0, column4: distance to top-left corner (0,0) is 0+4=4. To top-right (0,9) is0+5=5. Replacement3. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: The replacement number could be the number of 5s in the cross (row and column) of the 0. For example, the 0's row and column 5s. For Example0's first 0:\n\nRow0 has8 5s.\n\nColumn4 has7 5s.\n\nTotal 8+7=15. But replacement3. Not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, 8-7=1. No.\n\nI'm running out of ideas. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern there and see if it matches the training examples.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5,0,5,5,0,5,0,5]\n\n[5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\n[0,5,5,0,5,5,0,5,0,0]\n\n[5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5]\n\n[5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0]\n\n[0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0]\n\nLooking for a pattern in the training examples, perhaps each 0 is replaced by the number of 5s in its column. For example, in the first row of the test input, the 0s are in columns0,6,7. Let's check their column counts:\n\nColumn0 in test input:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:5\n\nRow2:5\n\nRow3:5\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:5\n\nRow7:5\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:5\n\nSo column0 has zeros in rows0,4,5,8 \u2192 four 0s. So replacement would be4. But looking at the training examples, the replacement numbers are 1,2,3. So perhaps modulo 3, 4 mod3=1. So replacement1. But in the training examples, when the column count was3, replacement was3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is (number of 0s in the column -1) modulo3 +1. For column0 in test input:4-1=3. 3 mod3=0. 0+1=1. So replacement1. Let's see if that works for training examples.\n\nExample0's first 0 (column4 has3 zeros). 3-1=2. 2 mod3=2. 2+1=3. Which matches the replacement3. For Example0's row1, column0 (five 0s in column0). 5-1=4. 4 mod3=1. 1+1=2. But the replacement was1. Doesn't fit. So this theory is invalid.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let's try to look for another pattern. Maybe the replacement is the number of previous 0s in the same column plus one. For Example0's first 0 (column4, row0): previous 0s in column4 before row0 are0. So 0+1=1. Replacement3. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 0s in the same column after the current row. For Example0's first 0 (column4, row0), after row0 there are two 0s (rows4 and6). So replacement2. But output is3. No.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of 0s before and after. For Example0's first 0, column4 has two after and none before. Sum2. Replacement3. No.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement is the number of 0s in the same diagonal. For example, the main diagonal passing through the 0. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a pattern in the replacement numbers and their positions in the output. For instance, in Example0's output, the replacements are 1, 2, 3. Let's see if these numbers are assigned based on the quadrant or region of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement could be based on the number of 0s in a specific direction from the 0. For example, looking east, west, north, south until a 5 is encountered.\n\nTake Example0's first 0 (row0, column4):\n\nWest: four 5s before hitting the start of the row.\n\nEast: three 5s before hitting another 0.\n\nSo west count is4, east count is3. Sum7. But replacement3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimum of west and east counts. 3. Which matches the replacement3. Let's check another example.\n\nExample0's row2, column9 is a 0. In the input row2: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0]. The 0 at column9 has east nothing (end of row). West: there's a 5 (column8 is5). So west count is1. East count is0. Minimum0. But replacement is2. So doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and not finding a pattern, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the observation that in Example0's first 0, the column has three 0s and the replacement is3. In Example2's first row, the first 0 in column0 has one 0 in the column and replacement is2. So perhaps the replacement is not directly the column count. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the replacement number is the number of 0s in the same row and column combined. For Example0's first 0: row has2 0s, column has3 \u2192 2+3=5. Replacement3. No.\n\nAlternatively, row count multiplied by column count. 2*3=6. Replacement3. 6 mod3=0. No.\n\nAlternatively, (row count + column count) divided by something. 2+3=5. 5/ something =3. Not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think the most plausible hypothesis is that the replacement number is the number of 0s in the same column as the current 0. Let's test this for the examples:\n\nExample0's first 0 (column4, three 0s) \u2192 replacement3. Correct.\n\nExample0's second row, first 0 (column0, five 0s) \u2192 replacement1. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample0's third row, last 0 (column9, two 0s in column9 across the input):\n\nLooking at column9 in Example0's input:\n\nRow0:5\n\nRow1:5\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:5\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:5\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:0\n\nSo column9 has five 0s (rows2,3,5,6,8,9) \u2192 six 0s. So replacement2. But the output is2. Wait, example0's third row's last 0 is replaced with2. Column9 has six 0s. So 6 mod4=2. Maybe. But I'm not sure.\n\nIn Example0's third row, column9's replacement is2. Column9 has six 0s. 6 mod4=2. So replacement is2. That fits. Maybe the replacement is the number of 0s in the column modulo4.\n\nLet's check Example0's second row, first 0 (column0, five 0s). 5 mod4=1. Replacement1. That fits.\n\nExample0's first row, first 0 (column4, three 0s) \u21923 mod4=3. Replacement3. Fits.\n\nExample0's third row, first 0 (column0, five 0s) \u21925 mod4=1. Replacement1. Fits.\n\nExample0's third row, last 0 (column9, six 0s) \u21926 mod4=2. Replacement2. Fits.\n\nExample0's fifth row (input: [0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0]). Let's look at the 0s:\n\nFirst 0 in column0: five 0s in column0 \u21925 mod4=1. But replacement is2. Wait, in the output for row5, the first 0 is replaced with2. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, row5 in Example0's input has three 0s. The output is [2,5,3,5,5,5,5,3,5,2]. The 0s are replaced with2,3,3,2. Let's check their columns:\n\nFirst 0 in column0: column0 has five 0s. 5 mod4=1. Output is2. Doesn't fit.\n\nSecond 0 in column2: column2 has how many 0s in Example0's input?\n\nLooking at column2 across all rows in Example0's input:\n\nRow0:5\n\nRow1:5\n\nRow2:5\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:5\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:5\n\nRow7:5\n\nRow8:5\n\nRow9:5\n\nSo column2 has two 0s (row3 and row5). 2 mod4=2. Replacement3. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis theory is invalid.\n\nBut maybe it's modulo3. Let's try:\n\nColumn0 in Example0's second row has five 0s. 5 mod3=2. Replacement1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAfter extensive analysis and multiple failed hypotheses, I'm forced to conclude that the pattern is to replace each 0 with the number of 0s in its respective column modulo 4. This fits some cases but not others. However, given the training examples and time constraints, this might be the best approach.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTake the first row of the test input: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5]\n\nThe 0s are at columns0,6,7.\n\nFor column0: Let's count the number of 0s in column0 across all rows:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:5\n\nRow2:5\n\nRow3:5\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:5\n\nRow7:5\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:5\n\nSo column0 has 0s in rows0,4,5,8 \u2192 four 0s. 4 mod4=0. Replacement would be0, but in training examples, there's no 0 in the output. Wait, but the outputs have 1,2,3. So maybe (count mod3)+1. For four zeros:4 mod3=1, +1=2. So replacement2.\n\nFor column6: Let's count 0s in column6 of the test input:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:0\n\nSo six 0s. 6 mod3=0 \u21920+1=1. Replacement1.\n\nFor column7: column7:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:5\n\nRow2:5\n\nRow3:5\n\nRow4:5\n\nRow5:5\n\nRow6:5\n\nRow7:5\n\nRow8:5\n\nRow9:0\n\nSo 0s in rows0 and9 \u2192 two 0s. 2 mod3=2 \u21922+1=3. Replacement3.\n\nSo the first row's 0s would be replaced with2,1,3. But looking at the training examples, perhaps the order matters. The first 0 in column0 (count4 \u21921+1=2), second in column6 (count6 \u21920+1=1), third in column7 (count2 \u21922+1=3). So the output would be [2,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5].\n\nBut in the training examples, the order of replacement might be left to right. For example, in Example0's first row, the 0s are replaced based on their column counts. But in the test input's first row, three zeros replaced with2,1,3. However, the training examples show that the replacement numbers can be in any order, not strictly left to right. For instance, Example0's third row has replacements1,1,1,2 for columns0,6,7,9. The column counts for those columns:\n\n- Column0:5 0s \u21925 mod3=2 \u21922+1=3. But replacement is1. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each 0 is replaced by the number of 0s in its column modulo3 plus1. Let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest input first row's 0s:\n\nColumn0:4 \u21924 mod3=1 \u21921+1=2.\n\nColumn6:6 \u21926 mod3=0 \u21920+1=1.\n\nColumn7:2 \u21922 mod3=2 \u21922+1=3.\n\nSo replaced as2,1,3.\n\nSecond row of test input: [5,5,5,0,5,5,0,5,0,5]\n\n0s at columns3,6,8.\n\nColumn3: Let's count 0s in column3:\n\nRow0:5\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:5\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:5\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:5\n\nRow7:5\n\nRow8:5\n\nRow9:5\n\nSo column3 has three 0s (rows1,3,5). 3 mod3=0 \u21920+1=1.\n\nColumn6: as before, six 0s \u21920+1=1.\n\nColumn8: Let's count column8:\n\nRow0:5\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:5\n\nRow4:5\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:5\n\nRow8:5\n\nRow9:0\n\nSo column8 has five 0s (rows1,2,5,6,9). Five mod3=2 \u21922+1=3.\n\nSo the replacements would be1,1,3. So the row becomes [5,5,5,1,5,5,1,5,3,5].\n\nContinuing this process for all rows, but given time constraints, I'll proceed to generate the output based on this hypothesis.",
