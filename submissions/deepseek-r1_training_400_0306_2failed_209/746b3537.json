        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see what transformation is happening from the input to the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is three identical rows [1,1,1], and the output is each row reduced to [1], [2], [1]. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait no, the output is [1], [2], [1]. Wait, the input rows are all the same? Wait, no. Wait the first input row is [1,1,1], second is [2,2,2], third is [1,1,1]. So the output rows are [1], [2], [1]. So each output row is the first element of the input row. Because all elements in the input row are the same. So for each row, if all elements are the same, then the output is a single element, which is that value. So like, Example 1 has three identical rows of [3,4,6], and the output is [3,4,6]. Wait that's not the same as the first example. Wait in example 1, all three input rows are the same, but the output is the same as one row. So maybe that's different. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe the pattern is about consecutive duplicates. Let me check the other examples. Example 2: input rows are [2,3,3,8,1] repeated three times. Output is [2,3,8,1]. So it looks like they removed consecutive duplicates. Because in the original list, there are two 3s next to each other. So the output removes duplicates next to each other. So in the input row, 3 comes twice, so they keep one. Similarly, in Example 0's input, each row has all same elements. So when you remove consecutive duplicates, each row becomes [1], [2], [1]. Which matches the output. But in Example 1, the input rows are [3,4,6] each. So there's no consecutive duplicates in the row. So the output is the same as the input. So the output for each row is the row with consecutive duplicates removed. But then why in Example 3's input, the input is:\n\n[2,2]\n[6,6]\n[8,8]\n[8,8]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[2]\n[6]\n[8]\n\nEach row has two same elements. Removing consecutive duplicates would make each row [2], [6], [8], [8]. But the output has three rows: [2], [6], [8]. Wait the input has four rows. The output has three. Oh, that's a problem. Wait the input has four rows. But the output has three. So maybe there's another pattern here. So perhaps, the output is not just processing each row, but also merging rows that are the same after processing.\n\nWait Example 3's input is four rows:\n\nRow 1: [2,2] \u2192 becomes [2]\n\nRow 2: [6,6] \u2192 becomes [6]\n\nRow 3: [8,8] \u2192 becomes [8]\n\nRow 4: [8,8] \u2192 becomes [8]\n\nBut the output is:\n\n[2]\n\n[6]\n\n[8]\n\nSo the two [8] rows are merged into a single row. So the pattern is: for each row, first remove consecutive duplicates (so each row becomes a list of elements without consecutive duplicates), then if consecutive rows in the input are the same, they are merged into a single row in the output. Wait, but in Example 0, the input rows are:\n\nRow 1: [1,1,1] \u2192 [1]\n\nRow 2: [2,2,2] \u2192 [2]\n\nRow 3: [1,1,1] \u2192 [1]\n\nSo after processing each row, they are [1], [2], [1]. Since they are not consecutive duplicates, the output remains three rows. So the output is the same as the processed rows.\n\nIn Example 3, after processing each row, the first row is [2], second [6], third [8], fourth [8]. The third and fourth are the same. So in the output, those two are merged into one [8]. So the output is [2], [6], [8].\n\nSimilarly, Example 4: input has multiple rows. Let's look.\n\nInput:\n\n[4,4,4,4] \u2192 becomes [4]\n\n[4,4,4,4] \u2192 [4]\n\n[2,2,2,2] \u2192 [2]\n\n[2,2,2,2] \u2192 [2]\n\n[8,8,8,8] \u2192 [8]\n\n[3,3,3,3] \u2192 [3]\n\nSo after processing each row, they are [4], [4], [2], [2], [8], [3]. Then, merging consecutive duplicates. So first two [4] become one [4]. Next two [2] become one [2]. Then [8], [3] are single. So the output is [4], [2], [8], [3], which matches the example.\n\nSo the pattern is two steps:\n\n1. For each row, remove consecutive duplicates. So each row is reduced to a list where each element is not the same as the previous. For example, [2,3,3,8,1] becomes [2,3,8,1].\n\n2. Then, merge consecutive rows in the processed list if they are identical. So if after processing, two or more consecutive rows are the same, they become one row in the output.\n\nSo combining both steps: first process each row by removing consecutive duplicates, then merge consecutive identical rows into one.\n\nLet's test this against all examples.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[1,1,1] \u2192 [1]\n\n[2,2,2] \u2192 [2]\n\n[1,1,1] \u2192 [1]\n\nNo consecutive rows are the same after processing, so output is [1], [2], [1].\n\nExample 1:\n\nAll three rows are [3,4,6], which after processing remain [3,4,6] (no consecutive duplicates). Then, since all three processed rows are same, merge them into one. Wait, but in the output it's [3,4,6]. So merging consecutive identical rows. So if all three are same, they become one. But in example 1's output, it's [3,4,6], which is a single row. So that fits.\n\nExample 2:\n\nAll three input rows are [2,3,3,8,1], which after processing become [2,3,8,1]. Then, since all three rows are same, they are merged into one. But in the output, it's [2,3,8,1]. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in Example 2's input, there are three identical rows. After processing each into [2,3,8,1], all three rows are same. So they should be merged into a single row. So the output is [2,3,8,1], which matches the example. So that works.\n\nExample 3:\n\nProcessed rows are [2], [6], [8], [8]. Merge consecutive duplicates. The last two [8]s become one. So output is [2], [6], [8].\n\nExample 4:\n\nProcessed rows are [4], [4], [2], [2], [8], [3]. Merging consecutive duplicates gives [4], [2], [8], [3], which matches the example.\n\nOkay, this seems to fit all examples.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each row in the input, remove consecutive duplicate elements. So for example, [1,1,2] becomes [1,2].\n\n2. Then, in the list of processed rows, if there are consecutive rows that are identical, merge them into a single occurrence. So if two or more same rows come one after another, they become one.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 4]\n\n[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 4]\n\n[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 4]\n\n[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 4]\n\nSo first step: process each row by removing consecutive duplicates.\n\nOriginal row: [1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]\n\nProcessing:\n\n1 appears twice consecutively \u2192 keep one.\n\nThen 2, which is next and different.\n\n3 appears three times consecutively \u2192 keep one.\n\n8 appears twice \u2192 keep one.\n\nThen 4, which is next. So the processed row is [1, 2, 3, 8, 4].\n\nSince all four rows are the same, after processing each row becomes [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nThen, the second step: merge consecutive identical rows. Since all four processed rows are same, they should be merged into a single row. So the output should be [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nBut let me check the training examples again. For example, in example 1, three identical rows become one. So merging all consecutive duplicates. So in the test case, four identical rows would merge into one.\n\nSo the final output should be a single row: [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nBut wait, let me check all examples again. For example, in example 1, all three input rows are the same. After processing, each becomes the same, and then merged into one row. Similarly, here, four identical rows would become one.\n\nYes. So the test input's output should be [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nBut let me verify this. Let's see:\n\nTest Input after processing each row:\n\nRow 1: [1,2,3,8,4]\n\nRow 2: same\n\nRow 3: same\n\nRow 4: same\n\nSince all four are the same and consecutive, they merge into one row. So output is [1,2,3,8,4].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples. \n\nFirst, Example 0: The input is three rows of [1,1,1], [2,2,2], [1,1,1]. The output is [1], [2], [1]. Hmm, so each row in the output is the unique element from each input row. Because all elements in each row are the same, so they just take that single element.\n\nExample 1: All three rows are [3,4,6]. The output is the same as the input row. Wait, but in the output, it's [3,4,6], which is the original list. So maybe when all rows are identical, the output is the original row. But wait, in Example 0, the rows aren't all identical. The first and third rows are [1,1,1], and the middle is [2,2,2]. So their outputs are each row's unique element. But Example 1's input rows are all the same, so output is the same as the input. But wait, in Example 2, the input is three rows of [2,3,3,8,1], and the output is [2,3,8,1]. Oh, so here, maybe they are removing duplicates from each row. Because the original has two 3s, so after removing duplicates, it's [2,3,8,1]. Similarly, in Example 3: the input rows are [2,2], [6,6], [8,8], [8,8]. The output is [2], [6], [8]. Again, each row is deduplicated. And since the last two rows are both [8,8], their outputs are [8] each. \n\nWait, but in Example 4: The input has multiple rows. The first two rows are [4,4,4,4], then two rows of [2,2,2,2], then one [8,8,8,8], then [3,3,3,3]. The output is [4], [2], [8], [3]. So each row is deduplicated, but the output seems to take each unique row (after deduplication) once? Wait no. The input has rows in the order 4,4,2,2,8,3. The output is [4], [2], [8], [3]. So maybe the pattern is that for each row, we deduplicate consecutive duplicates. Wait, but in Example 0, the first and third rows are the same, and in the output, they both appear. So perhaps each row is processed to remove consecutive duplicates, but wait, maybe it's removing all duplicates and leaving the unique elements in order. Let me check.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input: [2,3,3,8,1]. The output is [2,3,8,1]. So consecutive duplicates (the two 3s) are reduced to one. Similarly, if there's a non-consecutive duplicate, like [1,2,1], would it become [1,2]? But let's check Example 4: the rows are all duplicates, so deduplicated to single elements. So perhaps for each row, we remove duplicates such that consecutive duplicates are removed, but the elements are kept in order, only keeping the first occurrence of each element. Wait, no. Wait, if in a row, the elements are all the same, like [1,1,1], then deduplicated to [1]. If there are duplicates next to each other, like [3,3,4,4], then deduup to [3,4]. But in Example 2, the input is [2,3,3,8,1]. The two 3s are consecutive, so output is [2,3,8,1]. So maybe the rule is to remove consecutive duplicates. So for each row, if there are consecutive duplicates, they are collapsed into a single instance, but non-consecutive duplicates are kept. Wait, but in Example 4, all elements are the same, so consecutive, so they collapse into one. \n\nWait, but let's see. How does the output structure relate to the input rows? For example, in Example 0, each input row is a list of identical elements, so their output is a list containing that element once. In Example 1, the input rows are all the same list [3,4,6], so the output is the same list. But wait, [3,4,6] has no duplicates, so output is same as input. If the input rows were [3,3,4,4,6], then the output would be [3,4,6]. So maybe the pattern is: for each row, collapse consecutive duplicates. Then, if multiple consecutive rows are the same (after processing), collapse them into a single row. Wait, that might be the case. Let's check the examples again.\n\nExample 0: The input rows are [1,1,1], [2,2,2], [1,1,1]. After processing each row (collapsing consecutive duplicates), each becomes [1], [2], [1]. Then, since consecutive rows may not be the same here, the output is all three rows. So output is [1], [2], [1].\n\nExample 1: All input rows are [3,4,6], which after processing (since no consecutive duplicates) remains [3,4,6]. Since all rows are the same after processing, they are collapsed into a single row. So output is [3,4,6].\n\nExample 2: All rows are [2,3,3,8,1]. Processing each row gives [2,3,8,1]. Since all processed rows are the same, output is that single row.\n\nExample 3: Input rows are [2,2], [6,6], [8,8], [8,8]. Processing each row gives [2], [6], [8], [8]. Now, consecutive rows: [2], [6], [8], [8]. The last two are the same, so they are collapsed into one [8]. So output is [2], [6], [8].\n\nBut wait, in the output of Example 3, the output is [2], [6], [8]. So the original input had four rows, but the output has three. Because the last two rows after processing become [8] and [8], which are consecutive and same, so merged into one. So the rule seems to be: process each row by collapsing consecutive duplicates, then merge consecutive identical rows into one.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each row in the input, process it to remove consecutive duplicates. So, in a row, any consecutive same elements are collapsed into a single instance. For example, [2,3,3,8,1] becomes [2,3,8,1].\n\n2. Then, look at the processed rows. If there are consecutive rows that are identical, merge them into a single row. So, if after step 1, two or more consecutive rows are the same, they become one row in the output.\n\nLet's test this against the examples.\n\nExample 0:\n\nOriginal rows after processing: [1], [2], [1]. These are not consecutive duplicates, so output all three.\n\nExample 1: All processed rows are [3,4,6], so they are consecutive and same. So merged into one.\n\nExample 2: All processed rows are same, merged into one.\n\nExample 3: Processed rows: [2], [6], [8], [8]. The last two are same, so merged into [8]. So output is three rows.\n\nExample 4: Original rows after processing: [4], [4], [2], [2], [8], [3]. Then, consecutive duplicates: first two [4] become one [4], next two [2] become one [2], followed by [8], [3]. So output is [4], [2], [8], [3].\n\nYes, that matches the training examples.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nFour rows of [1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4].\n\nFirst, process each row:\n\nOriginal row: [1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4].\n\nProcessing step: collapse consecutive duplicates.\n\nLet's walk through the elements:\n\n1,1 \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nThen 2 (different from previous 1).\n\nThen 3,3,3 \u2192 becomes 3.\n\nThen 8,8 \u2192 becomes 8.\n\nThen 4 (different from previous 8).\n\nSo the processed row is [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nSo each of the four rows becomes [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nNow, after processing all rows, we have four rows of [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nSince all four processed rows are the same and consecutive, they are merged into a single row [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, when all processed rows are same, they are merged into one. So in the test case, the output should be a single row [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs are presented as separate rows. Wait, no. Let me check the outputs.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input is three identical rows, and the output is a single row. So yes. Similarly, in Example 2, three identical rows become one. In Example 3, after processing, the four rows become [2], [6], [8], [8], which merge into three rows. So the test input, after processing all four rows into [1,2,3,8,4], and since they are consecutive and identical, they merge into one row. But the test input's output should be just [1,2,3,8,4].\n\nWait, but looking at the training example 1's output, the output is [3,4,6], which is the same as the processed row. So when all rows are merged into one, the output is that single row. So the test case should output [1,2,3,8,4].",
