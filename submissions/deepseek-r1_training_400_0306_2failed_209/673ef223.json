        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a grid of numbers, and the output seems to modify some of those numbers. Let me start by comparing the inputs and outputs for each example.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a 2 in the first column of several rows, and an 8 in the fourth row, fifth column. The output changes that 8 to a 4 and surrounds it with 8s. Also, in the bottom part, there's a row filled with 8s around the 2s. Hmm. Maybe it's about expanding 8s around certain numbers?\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s scattered, and the output replaces those 8s with 4 and fills adjacent cells with 8s. For instance, the row with 8 becomes a 4 with 8s to the left. Also, in the vertical 2s on the right, the middle row is filled with 8s. So maybe when there's a sequence of 2s, the middle of that sequence becomes a line of 8s?\n\nExample 2's input has 8s in various positions, and the output replaces those 8s with 4 and adds 8s around them. Like, the 8 in the fifth row becomes a 4 with 8s around. Also, the vertical 2s on the left have a row filled with 8s in the middle. Wait, in the output, some of the 2s are surrounded by 8s in their rows. \n\nPutting this together, the pattern seems to involve two things: \n\n1. Whenever there's an 8 in the input, it's converted to a 4, and the cells to the left and right (maybe in the same row) are filled with 8s. But maybe only in certain directions? In Example 0, the 8 is in row 3, column 4 (assuming 0-indexed?), and the output has 8s to the left, but not the right. Wait, the output row for that is [2,8,8,8,4,0,0,0]. So the 8 is at position 4, replaced by 4, and the three cells before it are 8s. So maybe when there's an 8, it becomes a 4 and all cells to the left up to the next non-zero cell (like the 2 here) are filled with 8s. That might explain the leftward expansion.\n\n2. For vertical sequences of 2s (like in the rightmost column of Example 0 and 1), the middle row of the sequence is filled with 8s in all columns except the last. For example, in Example 0, the vertical 2s are from row 11 to 14. The middle row (13) becomes all 8s except the last column. Similarly in Example 1, the vertical 2s in the last column have a middle row (row 12) filled with 8s. So maybe for any vertical run of 2s, the middle row in that run gets filled with 8s in all positions except the one with the 2.\n\nSo combining these two rules:\n\n- For each 8 in the input, replace it with 4 and fill all cells to the left (or maybe in both directions?) until hitting a non-zero cell (like the 2) with 8s. So it's expanding leftwards from the 8, turning it into 4 and the prior cells to 8s.\n\n- For vertical runs of 2s (consecutive 2s in the same column), replace the middle row of that run with 8s in all positions except the column where the 2 is. Wait, in Example 0, the vertical 2s are from rows 11 to 14 (four rows), so the middle is rows 12 and 13. Wait, the output for row 13 is all 8s except the last element. So maybe if the vertical run is even-length, take the lower middle? Or maybe the middle is when you have a stretch, like if there are N consecutive 2s, the middle one is replaced with 8s in the row except the 2.\n\nWait, let's check the vertical runs. In Example 0, the vertical 2s in the last column are rows 11-14 (four rows). The output has row 13 as all 8s except the last element. So perhaps for even-length runs, the middle two rows are considered, but in the output, only one of them is filled. Wait, four rows: indexes 11, 12, 13, 14 (assuming 0-based). The middle would be between 12 and 13. So maybe in such cases, the row just after the halfway point is filled. For four rows, the third row (index 13) is filled. Similarly, in Example 1, the vertical 2s in the last column are rows 11-15 (five rows). The middle row is row 13 (index 12 if 0-based?), but the output's row 12 is filled with 8s. Wait, in Example 1, the vertical 2s are rows 11-15 (five rows: 11,12,13,14,15). The middle is row 13 (third of five). The output's row 12 (assuming 0-based) has all 8s. Wait, maybe the count starts from 0. Let me check:\n\nExample 1's input has vertical 2s in rows 11-15 (indices 10-14 if 0-based). So five rows. Middle would be index 12 (third row). So the output has row 12 (0-based) as filled with 8s. So yes, that's the middle. So for a vertical run of 2s, the middle row (rounded down?) is filled with 8s except the last column.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For every 8 in the input grid, replace it with a 4. Then, starting from the 8's position (now 4), move leftwards and set all cells to 8 until a non-zero cell is encountered. For example, in Example 0, the 8 is in row 3, column 4. Moving left, there are three zeros before the 2 in column 0. So those three cells become 8s, and the 8 becomes 4.\n\n2. For each vertical sequence of 2s (same column, consecutive rows), find the middle row of that sequence. In that row, replace all elements (except the column where the 2 is) with 8s. So if the 2s are in column 7 (as in Example 0), then in the middle row, all columns except 7 are 8s.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nFirst, check for any 8s. There are a few:\n\n- Row 2 (index 2) column 8 (value 8).\n- Row 3 column 7 (value 8).\n- Row 5 column 4 (value 8).\n\nFor each of these 8s, we need to replace them with 4 and fill leftwards with 8s until a non-zero cell is encountered.\n\nLet's process each 8:\n\n1. Row 2, column 8: the cell is 8. Replace with 4. Now, move left from column 8 to the left. The cells in row 2 are: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]. After replacement, it's [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]. Then, fill leftwards from column 8 (now 4) to the left. The cells to the left are column 7 (0), column 6 (0), etc., until we hit a non-zero. The first non-zero is column 0 (value 2). So from column 8 to column 0, but wait, the 8 is at column 8. Moving left, columns 7,6,...0. But in row 2, the first cell (column 0) is 2. So we need to fill all cells from column 8 to the left until we hit the 2. So columns 1 to 7 would be filled with 8s? Wait, no. Let's think: in Example 0, the 8 was at row 3, column 4 (input). The output for that row is [2,8,8,8,4,0,0,0]. So the 8 is replaced by 4, and the cells to the left (columns 1-3) are filled with 8s. The original row was [2,0,0,0,8,0,0,0], which becomes [2,8,8,8,4,0,0,0]. So starting at column 4 (the 8), moving left, replace all zeros until a non-zero (the 2 in column 0) with 8s. But how many cells? Because between the 2 and the 8, there are three zeros (columns 1-3). So those are replaced with 8s.\n\nIn the test input's row 2, the 8 is at column 8. The row is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]. So replacing the 8 with 4, then moving left from column 8 to the first non-zero (which is column 0, the 2). So columns 1 to 8-1 (columns 1 to 7) would be filled with 8s. So the row becomes [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0].\n\nNext, row 3, column 7 (value 8). Replace with 4. The row is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]. So moving left from column 7. The first non-zero to the left is column 0 (2). So columns 1-7 (all left of 8) would be filled with 8s. So the row becomes [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0].\n\nThen, row 5, column 4 (value 8). Replace with 4. The row is [2,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So moving left from column 4. The leftmost non-zero is column 0 (2). So columns 1-4-1 (columns 1-3) are zeros. So fill those with 8s. So row becomes [2,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nNow, check vertical sequences of 2s. Let's look for columns with consecutive 2s. \n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nIn column 0, rows 1-5 have 2s: rows 1 (index 1) to 5 (index 5) (assuming 0-based rows). Wait:\n\nRow 1: [2,0,...]\nRow 2: [2,0,...]\nRow 3: [2,0,...]\nRow 4: [2,0,...]\nRow 5: [2,0,...]\nRow 6: [2,0,...]\n\nWait, test input rows 1 to 6 are:\n\nRow 1: 2 followed by zeros.\nRow 2: 2 followed by zeros except column 8.\nRow 3: 2 followed by zeros except column 7.\nRow 4: 2 followed by zeros.\nRow 5: 2 followed by zeros except column 4.\nRow 6: 2 followed by zeros.\n\nSo in column 0, rows 1-6 (6 rows) have 2s. So a vertical run of 6 2s. The middle would be between rows 3 and 4 (indices 3 and 4). Since it's even, maybe pick the lower middle, like row 4 (index 3 is third row of six, maybe index 3 and 4). Wait, six elements: indices 1,2,3,4,5,6. Middle is between 3 and 4. So perhaps in this case, the middle is row 3.5, so maybe take the third row (index 3) or the fourth (index 4)? Let's check the examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the vertical 2s are in the last column, rows 11-14 (four rows). Middle is between 12 and 13. The output fills row 13 (index 13). So in even-length runs, maybe the higher index is chosen. So for 4 rows (indices 11,12,13,14), the middle rows are 12 and 13. The output fills row 13. So perhaps in even lengths, the second middle row is chosen.\n\nSo for 6 rows (indices 1-6), the middle is between 3 and 4. So perhaps index 3.5 is the middle. So maybe index 4 (third row) is the one to fill. Alternatively, perhaps the middle is calculated as floor((length-1)/2). For length 4: (4-1)/2 = 1.5 \u2192 floor is 1. So the middle is at index 1 (second row), but in example 0, the filled row was index 13, which for a length 4 run (indices 11-14) would be (14-11+1)=4 rows. So (4-1)/2=1.5 \u2192 floor 1. So index 11 +1 =12. But in example 0's output, row 13 (index 13) was filled. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle row is determined as the ceiling of (length/2) -1. For example:\n\nFor a run of length 4, middle row is 4/2 =2 \u2192 index 2 (third row if 0-based). But in example 0, the run starts at index 11 and ends at 14 (4 rows: 11,12,13,14). So the middle would be 11 + (4//2) -1 =11+2-1=12. But the filled row is 13. So perhaps another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for any vertical run of 2s, the middle row (rounded up) is filled. For even lengths, take the lower middle. For example, in a run of 4, the third row (index 12) would be filled. But in example 0, the filled row is index 13. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the indices wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the central row. For even lengths, perhaps two middle rows, but the output shows only one filled. So perhaps in such cases, the lower of the two is filled. For example 0's vertical run of 4 rows, the filled row is the third one (index 13). So for rows 11-14 (indices), the filled is 13. The length is 4. The middle positions would be 12 and 13. So perhaps the lower of the two (13) is filled.\n\nIn the test input, the vertical run in column 0 is rows 1-6 (indices 1 to 6, inclusive), which is 6 rows. The middle positions would be 3 and 4. So perhaps the lower one, index 4, is filled. So in row 4, which in the input is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], the output would have all columns except column 0 filled with 8s. So the row becomes [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nWait, but looking at the other examples, like Example 1's vertical 2s in the last column (rows 11-15, 5 rows). The middle row is 13 (index 12 if 0-based?), which was filled with 8s. So for 5 rows, the middle is the third row. So for 6 rows, perhaps the third and fourth rows, and the fourth is filled.\n\nSo in the test input's column 0, the vertical run is 6 rows (indices 1-6). The middle is between 3 and 4. If we take the fourth row (index 3+1 =4?), then in row 4, which is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], the output would be [2,8,...,8].\n\nAdditionally, there's a vertical run of 2s in the last column (column 11) in rows 14-19 (indices 14-19, 6 rows). So same as before: the middle row would be index 16 or 17? Let's see: rows 14-19 is 6 rows. The middle would be between 16 and 17. So perhaps row 17 (index 17) is filled. In the output, that row would have all 8s except the last column (2). So the row becomes [8,8,...,8,2].\n\nSo applying these steps:\n\n1. Replace all 8s with 4 and fill left until a non-zero (2) with 8s.\n\n2. For vertical 2 runs, fill the middle row with 8s except the 2's column.\n\nPutting it all together for the test input:\n\nLet's process each 8:\n\nRow 2, column 8: becomes 4, and columns 1-7 filled with 8s.\n\nRow becomes [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0].\n\nRow 3, column 7: becomes 4, columns 1-7 filled with 8s.\n\nRow becomes [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 5, column 4: becomes 4, columns 1-3 filled with 8s.\n\nRow becomes [2,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nNow, vertical 2s:\n\nIn column 0, rows 1-6 (6 rows). Middle rows are 3 and 4. We choose the fourth row (index 4). So row 4 becomes [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nIn column 11 (last column), rows 14-19 (indices 14-19, 6 rows). Middle rows 17 and 18. Choose row 18 (index 18). So row 18 becomes [8,8,...,8,2].\n\nWait, but in the input, row 19 is all zeros except the last column. But the vertical run is rows 14-19 (assuming 0-based):\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow 14: last element is 2.\n\nRow 15: last element is 2.\n\nRow 16: last element is 2.\n\nRow 17: last element is 2.\n\nRow 18: last element is 2.\n\nRow 19: last element is 2.\n\nRow 20: last element is 0.\n\nSo the vertical run in column 11 (assuming the test input has 21 rows, indices 0-20). The run is from row 14 to 19 (indices 14-19 inclusive), which is 6 rows. The middle rows are 17 and 18 (indices 17 and 18). Choosing the higher index (18), so row 18 becomes filled with 8s except the last column.\n\nSo row 18 becomes [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2].\n\nPutting all that together, the output rows would be:\n\nRow 2: [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [2,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow 18: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2]\n\nNow, the other rows should remain as per the input, except these changes.\n\nLet's check the structure. The test input has 21 rows (0-20). The output should reflect these changes.\n\nThe final output should be an array of arrays, where most rows are the same as input except for the modified rows (2,3,4,5,18). Let's construct each row:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: [2,0,...] remains the same.\n\nRow 2: modified as above.\n\nRow 3: modified as above.\n\nRow 4: modified to all 8s except first column.\n\nRow 5: modified as above.\n\nRow 6: same as input.\n\nRows 7-13: same as input (zeros).\n\nRow 14: [0,...0,2] same as input except column 11.\n\nRow 15: same.\n\nRow 16: same.\n\nRow 17: same.\n\nRow 18: modified to all 8s except last column.\n\nRow 19: same as input (last column 2).\n\nRow 20: zeros.\n\nSo putting all together, the output should look like:\n\nEach row in the test input is modified where necessary. Let me write out the entire output step by step.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I see that the input is a grid of numbers, and the output modifies certain cells. Let's start by comparing the input and output for each example to see what's changing.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has a 8 in the fourth row, fifth column (indexes maybe starting at 0?). The output in that row changes the cells around the 8 to 8s and a 4. Specifically, the row becomes [2, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0]. So the 8 is replaced by 4, and the cells to the left up to the next non-zero (the 2s) are filled with 8s. Then, looking at the bottom part where there's a column of 2s, the output has a row filled with 8s except the last element which is 2. So maybe when there's a vertical line of 2s, they get replaced with 8s except the middle one becomes 4? Wait, no. In Example 0, the row with all the 2s in the input (rows 11 to 14 in the input, which are [0,...,2], etc.), the output in row 13 becomes all 8s except the last element remains 2, and the middle of that row is 8s. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is about expanding 8s around certain positions. Let's look for the 8 in the input. For example, in Example 0's input, the 8 is at position (3,4) if rows are zero-based. The output in that row (3) becomes [2,8,8,8,4,0,0,0]. So the 8 is replaced by 4, and the cells to the left (from the 2) are filled with 8s. So maybe the rule is: when there's an 8 in the input, replace it with 4, and fill the cells between the nearest non-zero (like the 2 in the same row) with 8s. But how far to the left? In that case, the first element is 2, then three 8s, then 4. So from the 2 to the 8 (original position), replace those cells with 8s and the 8 becomes 4.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: the input has 8s at various positions. For instance, in row 2, column 7 (value 8). The output for row 2 becomes [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0]. So between the 2 (start of the row) and the 8, all cells become 8s, and the original 8 becomes 4. Similarly, in row 4 of the input, there's an 8 at column 5. The output for row 4 is [2,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0]. Again, filling between the 2 and the 8 with 8s, replacing the 8 with 4.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for any row that has an 8, look for the first non-zero element to the left of the 8 (which is a 2 in all these examples), then replace all elements between the 2 and the 8 with 8s, and replace the original 8 with a 4. That way, the 4 is at the position where the 8 was, and the 8s fill the space between the 2 and the 4.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2's input, where there's an 8 in row 4, column 6, the output row 4 becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,8,8,2]. So here, maybe the first non-zero to the left of the 8 is a 2 in column 9? Wait, no. The original input row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2]. Oh, so the 8 is at column 6, and the 2 is at column 9. So between 6 and 9, there's 8s except the 8 becomes 4. Wait, in the output, the row becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,8,8,2]. So the 8 is replaced by 4, and the cells to the right up to the 2 are filled with 8s. Wait, that's different from the previous examples. So maybe the direction isn't just left but perhaps depends on the position relative to the 2?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 2 is at the start of the row, and the 8 is in the fourth position (index 4). So between 0 and 4, all become 8s except the original 8 becomes 4. But in Example 2's row 4, the 2 is at column 9, and the 8 is at column 6. So the direction is to the right. So maybe the rule is: for each row, find all 8s. For each 8, look to the left until you find a 2 (the first non-zero to the left) and fill the cells between the 2 and the 8 with 8s, then replace the original 8 with a 4. If the 2 is to the right of the 8, then fill to the right. Wait, but in Example 2's row 4, the 2 is at the end (column 9) and the 8 is at column 6. So in the output, the 8 is replaced by 4, and the cells between 6 and 9 (positions 6,7,8) become 4,8,8, but in the output it's 4,8,8,2. So perhaps between the 4 and the 2, fill with 8s. So the 4 is at 6, then 7,8 are 8s, and 9 is 2. So the 8s fill between the 4 and the 2. Wait, but the original 8 was at 6. So the 4 is placed there, and the next cells up to the 2 are filled with 8s. So the direction is from the 4 (original 8) to the next 2 on the same row, and fill in between with 8s.\n\nBut how do we determine which 2 to connect to? In Example 0, the 2 is at the start of the row, so the 8s are filled from the 2 up to the 4. In Example 1's row 2, the 2 is at the start, the 8 is in column 7, so the 8s are filled from 0 to 7, with 4 at 7. But in Example 2's row 4, the 8 is at 6 and the 2 is at 9. So perhaps, for each 8 in a row, we look for the next 2 either to the left or right, and fill the cells in between with 8s, replacing the original 8 with a 4. So the 4 is the original 8's position, and the 8s are filled between the nearest 2s. But how to determine which 2 is the nearest in each direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are part of a \"bridge\" between two 2s, but that's not evident in the examples. Let's check another part. For instance, in Example 2's output, the row 14 and 15 have 2s in column 0. The output for row 14 is [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], which is a row starting with 2 followed by eight 8s. So here, the original input row 14 is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the output fills all the way to the end with 8s. So perhaps when there's a 2 at the start of a row and no other 8, but in the output, it's filled with 8s. Wait, but how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input, row 13 has [2,0,...0], and in the output, row 13 becomes [2,0,...0], but row 14 becomes [2,8,8,...8]. So perhaps when there's a vertical sequence of 2s, the middle rows get filled with 8s. Like in Example 0, the vertical 2s in the last column (columns 7) in rows 11-14. The output in row 13 of that example is filled with 8s except the last element is 2. So maybe when there are consecutive 2s in a column, the middle rows in that column are replaced with 8s, except the ends. For example, in Example 0's column 7 (last column), the input has 2s in rows 11-14. The output in row 13 (the middle of those four rows) is filled with 8s. So if there's an even number of consecutive 2s in a column, maybe the middle two rows are filled? Hmm, but in Example 0, rows 11-14 (4 rows) of 2s. The middle two would be rows 12 and 13, but in the output, only row 13 is filled with 8s. So maybe for a vertical sequence of 2s, the middle row (if odd) or something like that is filled with 8s. Wait, in Example 0, the input has four consecutive 2s in column 7 (rows 11-14). The output for row 13 is filled with 8s. So maybe for a vertical run of N 2s, the middle row is filled with 8s. For N=4, the middle is between rows 12 and 13. So perhaps the lower middle (row 13) is filled. Alternatively, perhaps when there's a vertical line of 2s, the entire column between the first and last 2 is filled with 8s except the first and last. Wait, in Example 0's column 7, the output has 8s in row 13. So only the middle row. But in Example 1's column 9 (last column), the input has 5 rows of 2s (rows 11-15). The output in row 12 and 14 (for example 1) have 8s. Wait, in Example 1's output, rows 12 and 14 are filled with 8s. Looking at the input, the vertical 2s in column 9 (last) are rows 11-15 (5 rows). The output in row 12 is [8,8,...8,2], and row 14 is [8,8,...8,2]. So for five rows, two middle rows are filled with 8s. So maybe the pattern is that for vertical sequences of 2s, every other row (starting from the first) is filled with 8s except the first and last. Or perhaps the middle rows.\n\nThis seems a bit more complex. Let's try to break it into two parts: handling the horizontal 8s and the vertical 2s.\n\nFirst, horizontal transformations:\n\nWhenever there's an 8 in a row, replace it with 4, and fill the cells between the nearest 2s (left and right) with 8s. Wait, but in Example 0's input row 3 (the row with 8), there's a 2 at the start (index 0) and the 8 at index 4. The output fills indices 1-3 with 8s, replaces index 4 with 4. So between the 2 and the 4, fill with 8s.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 2 has an 8 at index 7. The nearest 2 to the left is at index 0. So the output fills 0 to 7 with 8s except the 8 becomes 4. Wait, no. The output row is [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0]. So from index 0 (2) to index 7 (4), everything in between is 8s. So the 2 is at index 0, then 8s up to index 6, then 4 at index 7.\n\nSo the rule for horizontal seems to be: for each 8 in a row, look to the left until you find the first 2. Then, replace all cells between the 2 and the 8's position (exclusive of the 2) with 8s, then replace the original 8 with 4. So the 2 remains, the next cells until the original 8 are filled with 8s, and the original 8 becomes 4.\n\nBut what if there's a 2 after the 8? Like in Example 2's input row 4, where the 8 is at index 6 and the 2 is at index 9. The output row becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,8,8,2]. So here, the 8 is replaced by 4, and then between the 4 and the 2 (indices 6 to 9), the cells are filled with 8s. So the direction is towards the right. So the rule would be: for each 8 in a row, look in both directions (left and right) for the nearest 2s. But in the case where there's a 2 to the right, the 8s are filled towards the right. So the algorithm could be: find the closest 2 to the left and right of the 8. Then fill between the 2 and the 8's position. But in the examples, it seems that the 8 is always between two 2s, but the examples given don't have that. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 2's input row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2]. So the 8 is at index 6, and the 2 is at index 9. The output fills indices 6 to 8 with 4 and 8s. So the 4 is at 6, then 7 and 8 are 8s, leading up to the 2 at 9. So the rule might be that when an 8 is between two 2s (one on the left and one on the right), but in this case, there's a 2 only to the right. Wait, in this input row, there's no 2 to the left of the 8. The only 2 is to the right. So perhaps when there's a 2 to the right of the 8, fill from the 8's position to the 2 with 8s, replacing the original 8 with a 4. But how is that determined?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: for any 8 in a row, replace it with a 4, and then look in both directions (left and right) for the nearest 2. Then, fill the entire segment between those two 2s with 8s, with the 4 in the original 8's position. But that might not fit all examples. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 0's row 3: 2 is at index 0, and the 8 is at 4. There's no 2 to the right of the 8. So perhaps the rightmost 2 is the one at index 0. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the leftmost 2 is considered. In row 3, the leftmost 2 is at index 0. So the segment is from 0 to 4. The output fills 1-3 with 8s, and replaces 4 with 4.\n\nBut the output row is [2,8,8,8,4,0,0,0]. So between the left 2 and the original 8 (now 4), the cells are filled with 8s. So the left 2 is the anchor, and the 8 is replaced with 4, with 8s filling the space between the 2 and the 4.\n\nIn Example 2's row 4, the 8 is at index 6, and there's a 2 at index 9. So the segment would be from 6 to 9. The 8 becomes 4, and the cells between 6 and 9 are filled with 8s. But in the output, the row becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,8,8,2]. So from index 6 (4) to 9 (2), indices 7 and 8 are 8s. So between the 4 and the 2, 8s are filled.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: for each 8 in a row, look for the nearest 2 to the left and to the right. Then, fill the entire segment between these two 2s with 8s, replacing the original 8 with a 4. But if there's only a 2 to the left or right, then fill in that direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's simpler: for each 8 in the input row, replace it with 4, and then fill all cells between the 4 and the next 2 (either left or right) with 8s. But how to decide direction?\n\nAnother approach: For each 8 in a row, check the direction in which there's a 2. If there's a 2 to the left, fill between the left 2 and the 4 (original 8 position) with 8s. If there's a 2 to the right, fill between the 4 and the right 2 with 8s. If there are 2s on both sides, maybe fill both directions?\n\nBut in Example 0, the 8 has a 2 to the left and no 2 to the right. So fill to the left (from 4 to the left 2). In Example 2's row 4, the 8 has a 2 to the right and no 2 to the left. So fill to the right (from 4 to the right 2).\n\nBut then, how to handle multiple 8s in a row. For example, in Example 1's input row 2: the input has [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]. The output is [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0]. So here, the 8 is replaced with 4, and between the left 2 and the 4, all are 8s. There's no 2 to the right, so only fill to the left.\n\nAnother example: in Example 1's input row 4, the input has [2,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]. The output is [2,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0]. So again, the 8 becomes 4, and the cells between left 2 and 4 are filled with 8s.\n\nBut in Example 2's input row 5, the input is [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. The output row becomes [0,0,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,2]. So the 8 at index 2 is replaced with 4, and then between 4 and the 2 at index 9, the cells are filled with 8s. So direction is to the right.\n\nSo the pattern for horizontal seems to be: for each 8 in a row, replace it with 4. Then, look to the left and right for the nearest 2. Fill all cells between the 4 and the nearest 2 (left or right) with 8s. If there's a 2 on both sides, perhaps fill in both directions. Wait, but in the examples provided, there's no case where an 8 is between two 2s. So maybe when there's a 2 on both sides, fill in both directions. But let's imagine a hypothetical case. Suppose a row has [2,0,8,0,2]. Then the output would be [2,8,4,8,2]? Not sure, but according to the previous pattern, perhaps.\n\nNow for the vertical part. Looking at the vertical sequences of 2s. For example, in Example 0's output, the last column (index 7) has 2s in rows 11-14 (input), and in the output, row 13 is filled with 8s except the last element. So vertical sequences of 2s in a column are replaced with 8s in the middle rows. So how does that work?\n\nIn Example 0's input, the last column (index 7) has 2s in rows 11-14 (four consecutive 2s). The output in row 13 (the middle of the four) has 8s in all columns except the last, which is 2. So the middle rows of the vertical sequence are filled with 8s.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the last column has 2s in rows 11-15 (five rows). The output in rows 12 and 14 are filled with 8s. For example, row 12 becomes [8,8,...8,2], and row 14 is similar. So for five rows, the middle two rows (12 and 14) are filled with 8s. Wait, but five rows would have a middle at row 13. Maybe the pattern is that for a vertical run of N 2s, the middle row (if N is odd) or the two middle rows (if N is even) are filled with 8s. So for N=4 (even), fill rows (N/2 -1) and (N/2). Wait, Example 0 has four rows (11-14). The middle would be between rows 12 and 13, so both are filled. But in the output, only row 13 is filled. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to fill every other row in a vertical sequence. For example, in a vertical sequence of 2s, starting from the second row, fill every other row with 8s. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's vertical sequence in column 7 has four 2s. The output fills row 13 (the third row in the sequence, 0-based: rows 11,12,13,14 \u2192 indices 0,1,2,3. Middle at indices 1.5, so maybe rows 1 and 2 (12 and 13) are filled. But in the output, only row 13 is filled. Hmm, not sure.\n\nExample 1's vertical sequence in column 9 has five 2s (rows 11-15). The output fills rows 12 and 14. So rows 1 and 3 (assuming 0-based within the sequence). So perhaps for vertical sequences, every other row starting from the second row. Like, for a sequence of N rows, the rows at positions 1,3,5... (if they exist) are filled. For N=5 (rows 0-4 in the sequence), positions 1 and 3 are filled. For N=4 (rows 0-3), position 2 is filled. That seems possible. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's sequence of 4 rows (0-3). The filled row is position 2 (third row) which is 13. So yes.\n\nExample 1's sequence of 5 rows (0-4). Filled rows are positions 1 and 3 (rows 12 and 14). So yes.\n\nExample 2's vertical sequences: Looking at the input, there's a vertical sequence in column 0, rows 13-18 (6 rows). The output for these rows is:\n\nRow 13: [2,0,...0]\n\nRow 14: [2,8,8,...8]\n\nRow 15: [2,8,8,...8]\n\nRow 16: [2,0,...0]\n\nRow 17: [2,8,8,...8]\n\nRow 18: [2,0,...0]\n\nSo in this case, the sequence is 6 rows (13-18). The filled rows are 14,15,17. Wait, how does that fit? 6 rows (indices 0-5 in the sequence). Filled rows would be indices 1,3,5? But in the output, row 14 (index 1 in the sequence) is filled, row 15 (index 2) is filled, row 17 (index 4) is filled. That doesn't fit the previous pattern. Hmm. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps vertical sequences are handled by filling all rows except the first and last with 8s. For example:\n\nExample 0's vertical sequence of 4 rows (input rows 11-14). Output fills row 13 (third row) but not 12. So maybe not.\n\nExample 1's vertical sequence of 5 rows (11-15). Output fills rows 12 and 14 (second and fourth rows). So excluding first and last. But for 5 rows, that's 3 middle rows. But they filled two. Not sure.\n\nThis part is a bit unclear. Let's try to see another pattern. For vertical sequences of 2s in a column, perhaps the output replaces every even-indexed row (within the sequence) with 8s. For example:\n\nIn Example 0's vertical sequence (4 rows, indices 0-3), rows 0 and 2 are even. But the output fills row 2 (third row in the input, which is index 2 in the sequence). So perhaps even indices (0-based) are filled. But 0 is the first row, 2 is the third. So for 4 rows, rows 0,1,2,3: even indices 0 and 2. But in Example 0's output, only row 2 is filled. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe every other row starting from the second row. For example, in Example 0, rows 11-14 (sequence length 4), the output fills row 13 (third row in the sequence). So the third row. For Example 1's sequence of 5 rows, the output fills rows 12 and 14, which are the third and fifth rows in the sequence. So perhaps every other row, starting from the third. Not sure.\n\nThis vertical part is tricky. Let's think of another approach. Maybe when there's a vertical line of 2s, they form a 'pillar' and the output creates a horizontal bridge between these pillars where there's an 8. But that seems similar to the horizontal transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical sequences of 2s are transformed into vertical sequences where the middle row is replaced with 8s. For example, in a vertical sequence of 4 2s, the middle two rows (rows 2 and 3) are filled with 8s, but in Example 0, only row 3 is filled. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps vertical sequences of 2s are not transformed directly, but the horizontal transformations affect them. But in Example 0's vertical 2s, the output has a row filled with 8s in the middle. How would that happen via the horizontal rule?\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the vertical 2s are in column 7. The output for row 13 (which is part of the vertical sequence) has all 8s except the last element. So maybe when a row has a 2 in a column and is part of a vertical sequence, certain transformations are applied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical 2s are being converted into 8s in the same column, except for the top and bottom 2s. But how?\n\nThis part is unclear. Let's focus on the horizontal transformations first and see if that's sufficient to generate the test input's output.\n\nNow, the test input:\n\nLooking at the test input, there are several 8s in the rows. Let's process each row with 8s according to the horizontal rule.\n\nTest input rows with 8s:\n\nRow 2: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]. So 8 at index 8. The first 2 is at index 0. So the output row should have 0 to 8 filled with 8s, then 4 at 8. But wait, the 8 is at index 8. So between 0 and 8, fill with 8s, and replace the 8 with 4. So the row becomes [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0].\n\nRow 3: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]. 8 at index 7. First 2 at 0. So filled from 0 to 7: [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 5: [2,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. 8 at index 4. So filled from 0 to 4: [2,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nThen, the vertical sequence in the last column (index 11) of the test input: rows 14-19 have 2s. Let's count them. Rows 14: [0,...,2], rows 15-19: [0,...,2]. So rows 14-19 (6 rows) of 2s in column 11. According to the vertical pattern observed in the examples, perhaps the middle rows are filled with 8s. For six rows (0-5 in the sequence), perhaps rows 2 and 3 (indices 2 and 3) are filled. So rows 14+2=16 and 14+3=17. So rows 16 and 17 (third and fourth rows in the vertical sequence) would be filled with 8s in column 11, but wait, no. Looking at the test input, the vertical sequence is from row 14 to row 19 (inclusive), which is 6 rows. So indices 0-5. The middle rows would be 2 and 3. So in the output, rows 16 and 17 (original row numbers 14+2=16 and 14+3=17) would have their entire rows filled with 8s except the last element (2).\n\nWait, but in Example 0's vertical sequence of 4 rows, the middle row (row 13) was filled. For 6 rows, maybe two middle rows (rows 3 and 4 of the sequence, which would be original rows 14+3=17 and 14+4=18). But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for even-length sequences, fill the middle two rows. For 6 rows (even), middle two are at indices 2 and 3. So rows 16 and 17 (original row numbers 14+2=16 and 14+3=17) would be filled.\n\nBut given that in Example 1's vertical sequence of 5 rows (odd), the middle row (index 2) and perhaps another were filled. But in the output, rows 12 and 14 were filled. So maybe for odd N, rows at indices 1,3,... are filled.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to apply the horizontal rule first and see.\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow 0: all zeros. Output remains the same.\n\nRow 1: [2,0,...0]. No 8s, so output same.\n\nRow 2: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]. Apply horizontal rule: 8 at index 8. Replace with 4. Fill between 0 (2) and 8 (now 4) with 8s. So indices 1-7 are 8s. So row becomes [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0].\n\nRow 3: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]. 8 at index 7. Replace with 4. Fill between 0 and 7: indices 1-6 are 8s. So row becomes [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 5: [2,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. 8 at index 4. Replace with 4, fill between 0 and 4: indices 1-3 are 8s. So row becomes [2,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nNow, looking at the vertical sequences in column 11 (last column). The test input has 2s in rows 14-19 (6 rows). Following Example 0's pattern (4 rows \u2192 1 row filled), and Example 1's (5 rows \u2192 2 rows filled), perhaps for 6 rows, two middle rows are filled. The middle of 6 rows would be between rows 2 and 3 (0-based indices in the sequence). So rows 14+2=16 and 14+3=17. So rows 16 and 17 would have their entire rows filled with 8s except the last element (2). But looking at Example 2's vertical sequences where row 14 and 15 are filled, perhaps it's different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for vertical sequences, every alternate row starting from the second row is filled. So in 6 rows:\n\nIndices: 0,1,2,3,4,5.\n\nFill rows 1,3,5. So original rows 15,17,19. But in Example 1's vertical sequence of 5 rows, filled rows were 12 and 14 (indices 1 and 3 in the sequence). So for 6 rows, maybe rows 1,3,5 are filled.\n\nBut how would that look in the output?\n\nIn any case, the vertical part is challenging. Let's look at the test input's vertical sequence in column 11, rows 14-19 (6 rows). The output would need to fill some of these rows with 8s in the entire row except the last element (which remains 2).\n\nLooking back at the examples, in Example 0's vertical sequence (4 rows), only the middle row (13) is filled. In Example 1's vertical sequence (5 rows), rows 12 and 14 (indices 1 and 3) are filled. In Example 2's vertical sequence (6 rows in the test input?), no, in Example 2's input, there's a vertical sequence in column 0 of rows 13-18 (6 rows). The output for those rows:\n\nRow 13: [2,0,...0]\n\nRow 14: [2,8,8,...8]\n\nRow 15: [2,8,8,...8]\n\nRow 16: [2,0,...0]\n\nRow 17: [2,8,8,...8]\n\nRow 18: [2,0,...0]\n\nSo in this case, the vertical sequence is 6 rows (13-18). The filled rows are 14,15,17. But how does that pattern work? It's not clear. Maybe for vertical sequences, every even-numbered row (starting from 0) is filled, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps rows are filled when they are in even positions (like 14,16,18), but in this example, row 14 is filled, row 15, which is odd, is filled, then row 17. So no clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical sequences are transformed into having horizontal 8s across the entire row except the last element (the 2). But in Example 0, row 13 is filled with 8s except the last element. In Example 1, rows 12 and 14 are filled. So perhaps whenever there's a vertical sequence of 2s, the rows that are in the middle or at certain positions have their entire rows filled with 8s except the last column.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to fill. It's possible that for each vertical sequence of 2s in a column, the rows that are odd in the sequence (1st, 3rd, etc.) are filled. For example:\n\nExample 0's vertical sequence has 4 rows (0-3 indices). Filled row is 2 (third row in sequence), which is index 2 (even). Not sure.\n\nExample 1's vertical sequence (5 rows, indices 0-4). Filled rows are 1 and 3 (indices 1 and 3, which are odd).\n\nExample 2's vertical sequence (6 rows, indices 0-5). Filled rows are 1,2,4 (14,15,17). So indices 1,2,4. Not sure.\n\nThis part is really unclear. Perhaps there's another approach. Maybe the vertical sequences of 2s are being transformed by the same horizontal rule. For example, if a row in the vertical sequence has an 8 elsewhere, the horizontal rule applies, but if not, the vertical sequence remains. But in Example 0's output, row 13 has all 8s except the last column. There's no 8 in that row's input. So that's not explained by the horizontal rule.\n\nAlternative idea: the vertical sequences of 2s are being converted into horizontal 8s in the same row. For instance, in Example 0's row 13, which is part of the vertical sequence, the entire row is filled with 8s except the last element. But why?\n\nLooking at the input for Example 0, row 13 in the input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. The output for row 13 is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2]. So the entire row is filled with 8s except the last element. This doesn't fit the horizontal rule since there's no 8 in the input row. So there must be another rule for vertical sequences.\n\nThis suggests that there's a second rule: for any row that is part of a vertical sequence of 2s in the last column, fill all the cells in that row with 8s except the last column. But in Example 0, only row 13 is filled. In Example 1, rows 12 and 14 are filled. So this implies that not all rows in the vertical sequence are filled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical sequence's middle row(s) are filled with 8s across the entire row except the last column. For Example 0's vertical sequence of four rows, the middle two rows (rows 12 and 13) would be filled. But in the output, only row 13 is filled. So maybe the middle row for even-length sequences is the lower middle. For example, four rows: the third row (index 2) is filled. Five rows: the third and fifth (indices 2 and 4). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical sequences are connected to the horizontal transformations. For example, when a row in a vertical sequence has a horizontal transformation (due to an 8), then the entire row is filled with 8s except the last column. But in Example 0's row 13, there's no 8 in the input. So that can't be.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should focus on applying the horizontal rule for the test input and then assume that the vertical sequences in the last column (rows 14-19) are handled by filling the middle rows. Let's proceed.\n\nApplying the horizontal rule to the test input:\n\nFor each row with an 8:\n\nRow 2: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0] \u2192 replace 8 with 4, fill between 0 and 8 with 8s. So becomes [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0].\n\nRow 3: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0] \u2192 replace 8 with 4, fill between 0 and 7 with 8s \u2192 [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 5: [2,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 becomes [2,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nOther rows remain the same.\n\nThen, for the vertical sequence in column 11 (last column), rows 14-19 have 2s. Let's assume that for each vertical sequence of N rows, the middle row(s) are filled with 8s except the last element. For 6 rows, the middle two rows are 3 and 4 (0-based indices 2 and 3 in the sequence). So rows 14+2=16 and 14+3=17 (original rows 16 and 17) are filled with 8s in all columns except the last (which remains 2). So rows 16 and 17 become [8,8,...,8,2].\n\nAdditionally, looking at Example 2's vertical sequence in column 9 (output rows 14 and 15 have 8s filled), perhaps for even-length sequences, we fill two middle rows, and for odd-length, one or two.\n\nPutting this together, the test output would have:\n\nRows 16 and 17 (last column's vertical sequence) filled with 8s except the last element. So those rows would look like [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2] for each of those rows.\n\nNow, let's assemble the output.\n\nTest input rows after horizontal transformation:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: [2,0,...0].\n\nRow 2: [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0].\n\nRow 3: [2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 5: [2,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRows 14-19: original are [0,...,2], etc.\n\nAfter applying vertical transformation to rows 16 and 17:\n\nRow 16: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2].\n\nRow 17: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2].\n\nOther rows in the vertical sequence remain as [0,...,2].\n\nSo the final output would look like:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0]\n\n[2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n... (rows 7-13 remain zeros except row 14-19, last column)\n\nRow 14: [0,...,2] (no change)\n\nRow 15: [0,...,2] (no change)\n\nRow 16: [8,8,...,8,2]\n\nRow 17: [8,8,...,8,2]\n\nRow 18: [0,...,2]\n\nRow 19: [0,...,2]\n\nRow 20: [0,...,0]\n\nBut wait, the test input has 21 rows (0-20). The vertical sequence in the last column is rows 14-19 (6 rows). So rows 14-19 in the output would be:\n\nRow 14: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow 15: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow 16: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2]\n\nRow 17: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2]\n\nRow 18: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow 19: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nSo this would match the pattern where the middle two rows of the vertical sequence are filled.\n\nPutting all together, the final output would be as follows.",
