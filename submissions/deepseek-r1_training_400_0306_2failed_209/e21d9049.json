        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a grid of numbers, mostly zeros, with some non-zero numbers in certain positions. The output grids seem to have a repeating pattern and some changes from the input.\n\nStarting with Example 0: The input has a few non-zero numbers. In row 2 (0-indexed?), there's an 8, row 3 has a 3, and row 4 has 8, 3, 2. The output has those numbers arranged in a different way. The output's row 4 has the sequence 8, 3, 2 repeating. Also, other rows above and below have elements from these numbers. Maybe it's a matter of propagating those numbers in some way.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a row with 2, 3, 8, 4. The output's middle row (row 6) has a repeating sequence 3,8,4,2,3,8,4,2, etc. So it looks like the numbers from the input's non-zero row are being arranged in a cycle and then tiled across the middle row. Then, the rows above and below have elements of this sequence in a staggered manner.\n\nSo the pattern might be: identify the non-zero elements in a particular row of the input (maybe the first non-zero row from the bottom?), create a cycle from those elements, then replicate that cycle across the middle row of the output. Then, propagate the elements upwards and downwards in a certain pattern.\n\nFor the Test Input, the non-zero elements are in row 5 (4th index?), row 6 (5th index?), etc. Let's check the input. The first non-zero row from the bottom might be row 6 (0-indexed), which is [0,0,0,0,0,4,2,3,1,0,...]. The non-zero numbers here are 4,2,3,1. Wait, but in the input row 6, it's 0,0,0,0,0,4,2,3,1,0... So the non-zero elements are 4,2,3,1. Then, the cycle would be 4,2,3,1. But in Example 1, the input's non-zero row was 2,3,8,4, and the output's middle row was 3,8,4,2,3,8,4,2... which is a cycle starting from 3. Wait, maybe the cycle starts from the next element after the first in the input's non-zero row. Let me check Example 0 again. The input's non-zero row (row 4) was 8,3,2. The output's middle row (row 4) is 8,3,2 repeated. So the cycle starts as the same sequence. But in Example 1, the input's non-zero row (row 6) had 2,3,8,4. The output's middle row starts with 3,8,4,2. Wait, that's a shifted version. So maybe the cycle is formed by taking the elements in reverse order or shifted.\n\nWait, in Example 1 input, the non-zero elements in the row are 2,3,8,4. The output's middle row is 3,8,4,2,3,8,4,2... So it's starting with 3. Hmm, maybe the cycle is shifted left by one. The original sequence is 2,3,8,4. Shift left by one (removing the first element and appending it to the end) would be 3,8,4,2. Then repeating that gives the cycle. So maybe the pattern is to take the non-zero elements, shift them left by one to start the cycle, then repeat that sequence to fill the middle row. Then, the rows above and below have the elements of this cycle in a certain order.\n\nIn Example 0, the input's non-zero row is 8,3,2. Shifting left by one would be 3,2,8. But the output's middle row is 8,3,2 repeated. Wait, that's not matching. So maybe the cycle isn't shifted here. So maybe there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle row in the output is the sequence of non-zero elements from the input's first non-zero row (from the bottom), repeated as a cycle, and then the rows above and below are shifted versions of that cycle.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output: the middle row (row 4) is 8,3,2 repeated. The rows above (row 0,1,2,3) have 3, 2,8,3. Wait, row 0 in the output is [0,0,3,...], row 1 [0,0,2,...], row 2 [0,0,8,...], row3 [0,0,3,...], then row4 is the cycle. Then rows below (row5 onwards) have 8,3,2,8, etc. So perhaps the middle row is the cycle, and the rows above are each shifted to the right by one, and the rows below shifted to the left by one? Or maybe each row above and below takes the next element in the cycle.\n\nAlternatively, the rows above and below the middle row in the output each have a single element from the cycle, offset in a certain way.\n\nWait in Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: 0,0,3...\n\nRow1: 0,0,2...\n\nRow2:0,0,8...\n\nRow3:0,0,3...\n\nRow4:8,3,2,8,3,2...\n\nRow5:0,0,8...\n\nRow6:0,0,3...\n\nRow7:0,0,2...\n\nRow8:0,0,8...\n\nSo, after the middle row (row4), the following rows (5,6,7,8,9,10,11) have 8,3,2,8,3,2... in their third position. Similarly, the rows above (0-3) have 3,2,8,3 in the third position.\n\nSo perhaps the middle row is the cycle, and the rows above and below each take the next element in the cycle in their third position. For example, the middle row's cycle is [8,3,2]. The rows above (starting from the middle up) would be 3 (middle row's first element?), then 2, then 8, then 3 again. Similarly, the rows below (after the middle) start with 8 (the next element after the cycle?), then 3, then 2, then 8 again.\n\nWait, maybe the middle row's cycle is the sequence from the input's non-zero row. Then, the rows above have the elements of the cycle in reverse order, and the rows below have them in the same order. Or perhaps there's a spiral-like expansion. But this is getting a bit fuzzy.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the middle row (row6) is 3,8,4,2,3,8,4,2... The input's non-zero row (row6) was 2,3,8,4. So the cycle here is 3,8,4,2. Which is the input's sequence shifted left by one (since 2 was first, now it's 3,8,4,2). So perhaps the cycle is the input's non-zero elements, but starting from the second element and then cycling around. So the first element in the cycle is the second element of the input's non-zero row. Then, the cycle is that sequence repeated. Then, the middle row is filled with this cycle. Then, the rows above and below have elements of this cycle in a certain pattern.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the rows above the middle row (row6) are rows 0-5. For example, row0 has 4 in column 8, row1 has 8, row2 has 3, row3 has 2, row4 has 4, row5 has 8. Then the middle row (row6) starts with 3,8,4,2... So the rows above are cycling through 4,8,3,2,4,8. Which is 4,8,3,2,4,8. So that's like the cycle 4,8,3,2 repeated. Wait, but the cycle in the middle row is 3,8,4,2. So perhaps the rows above are using a different cycle. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the middle row's cycle is the same as the input's non-zero elements, but arranged in a way that starts with the second element and wraps around. Then, the rows above and below take each element from the cycle in a staggered manner.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input's non-zero row (row6) is 2,3,8,4. The cycle in the output's middle row is 3,8,4,2. So starting from the second element of the input row, then the rest, then the first. So the cycle is [3,8,4,2]. Then, the rows above and below have elements from this cycle. For example, the rows above middle row (row6) are rows 0-5. Looking at column 8 (since in the input, the non-zero elements are in column 8 and 9?), but in the output, each row has elements in the same column. For example, row0 in the output has 4 in column 8. Row1 has 8, row2 has 3, row3 has 2, row4 has 4, row5 has 8, and row6 starts the cycle 3,8,4,2. Then, below row6, rows7-14: row7 has 2, row8 has4, row9 has8, row10 has3, row11 has2, row12 has4, row13 has8, row14 has3. So the pattern here is that each row above and below the middle row has the next element in the cycle, stepping upward and downward.\n\nSo perhaps the middle row has the cycle starting from the second element of the input's non-zero row. Then, each row above is the previous element in the cycle, and each row below is the next element. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, the cycle is arranged such that the middle row starts with the second element of the input's non-zero sequence, then the rest, then the first element. Then, the rows above and below each take elements from the cycle in order, moving up and down.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of the steps:\n\n1. Find the non-zero row in the input. For Example 0, it's row4 (assuming rows are 0-indexed from top). The non-zero elements are 8,3,2. For Example1, row6 has 2,3,8,4. For Test Input, row6 (maybe 5 in 0-indexing) has 4,2,3,1.\n\n2. Extract those non-zero elements. For Test Input, the non-zero elements are 4,2,3,1.\n\n3. Create a cycle from these elements. For Example0, the cycle is 8,3,2. For Example1, the cycle is 3,8,4,2. So the cycle starts with the second element of the input's non-zero sequence, then continues, then wraps around to the first element.\n\nWait, in Example1's input, the non-zero elements are 2,3,8,4. The cycle is 3,8,4,2. So starts with the second element (3), then 8,4,2, which is the rest of the elements followed by the first element (2). So the cycle is the elements shifted left by one.\n\nSimilarly, in Example0, the non-zero elements are 8,3,2. Shifted left by one would be 3,2,8. But in the output, the middle row is 8,3,2 repeated. So that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe Example0 is a different case.\n\nWait, Example0's middle row is 8,3,2,8,3,2... So the cycle is exactly the same as the input's non-zero elements. But in Example1, it's shifted. So why the difference?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cycle is created by rotating the non-zero elements so that the first element is moved to the end. For Example1: 2,3,8,4 \u2192 rotate left once \u2192 3,8,4,2. So the cycle is rotated left once. For Example0: 8,3,2 \u2192 rotate left once \u2192 3,2,8. But the output cycle is 8,3,2. That contradicts. So maybe this isn't the case.\n\nWait, maybe the cycle is determined by the order of elements in the input's non-zero row, but arranged such that the elements are repeated in the same order. For Example0, the cycle is 8,3,2. For Example1, the cycle is 3,8,4,2. Wait, how does that relate to the input's non-zero elements? For Example1, input's non-zero elements are 2,3,8,4. The cycle starts with 3. So perhaps the cycle is the elements after the first element, then the first element appended. So 3,8,4,2. That would make sense. So in Example1, the first element of the non-zero row is 2. The cycle is 3,8,4,2. So the cycle is the elements from the second onward, then the first element. So for Test Input's non-zero elements (4,2,3,1), the cycle would be 2,3,1,4. Then, the middle row would be 2,3,1,4 repeated.\n\nWait, but let's check Example0. The non-zero elements are 8,3,2. The cycle is 8,3,2. So according to this, if the first element is 8, the cycle is 3,2,8. But in Example0's output, the cycle is 8,3,2. So this doesn't fit. So maybe the rule is different. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cycle starts with the first non-zero element of the row. But in Example1's output, the middle row starts with 3, which is the second element of the input's row. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cycle is determined by the order of the elements in the input's non-zero row, but starting from the leftmost non-zero element. For Example0, the input's row is 8,3,2. So the cycle is 8,3,2. For Example1, the input's row is 2,3,8,4. The cycle is 2,3,8,4. But in the output, the cycle is 3,8,4,2. So this doesn't fit. So this can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the cycle is the elements in reverse order. For Example1's input row 2,3,8,4, reversed is 4,8,3,2. But the output's cycle is 3,8,4,2. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the cycle is the elements sorted in some order. But 8,3,2 sorted would be 2,3,8. But Example0's output cycle is 8,3,2.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's try another approach. Let's look at the position of the non-zero elements in the input and how they are arranged in the output.\n\nIn Example0, the input's non-zero row is row4 (assuming 0-based index from top). The output's middle row is row4. So the middle row in the output corresponds to the same row in the input where the non-zero elements were. Then, the output's middle row has the non-zero elements repeated to fill the entire row. For example, input row4 is [8,3,2,0,0,...], output row4 is [8,3,2,8,3,2,8,3,2,8,3]. So the sequence 8,3,2 is repeated.\n\nIn Example1, the input's non-zero row is row6. The output's middle row is row6, which has the sequence 3,8,4,2 repeated. So the input row6's non-zero elements are 2,3,8,4. The output's middle row starts with 3, which is the second element of that input's row. Then 8 (third), 4 (fourth), 2 (first), then repeats. So it's the same elements, but starting from the second element and wrapping around.\n\nSo the pattern here could be: Take the non-zero elements from the input's row, rotate them left by one (shift left once, moving the first element to the end), then repeat this sequence to fill the middle row. Then, the rows above and below the middle row each have elements from this new sequence, positioned in the same column as the original non-zero elements, but shifted in the sequence.\n\nFor Example0, input's non-zero elements are 8,3,2. Rotating left once would be 3,2,8. But the output's middle row is 8,3,2. So that doesn't fit. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the rotation is different. In Example1, rotating left once gives 3,8,4,2, which matches the output. But for Example0, rotating left once gives 3,2,8, but the output is 8,3,2. So maybe the rotation isn't the same. What's different between the two examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rotation is only applied when the number of elements is even. In Example0, the non-zero elements are three in count (odd), so no rotation. In Example1, four elements (even), rotated left once. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rotation is determined by the position of the elements. For example, the first element is moved to the end of the sequence regardless of the count. Then, Example0's input sequence 8,3,2 becomes 3,2,8. But output is 8,3,2. So that doesn't fit. So this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cycle is the original elements, but the middle row starts repeating from the second element. For Example1, 2,3,8,4 becomes 3,8,4,2. So starting from the second element. Then, for Example0, 8,3,2 starts from the second element (3,2,8), but the output cycle is 8,3,2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cycle starts from the first element, but the output's middle row is shifted based on the row's position. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: in the output, the middle row is a repeating cycle of the non-zero elements from the input's row. But in Example1, the cycle is not the same as the input's row. So perhaps there's another rule. Let's look at the output rows above and below the middle row.\n\nIn Example0's output, the rows above the middle row (row4) are rows0-3. Each of these rows has a single non-zero element in the third column. The elements are 3,2,8,3. Then, row4 has 8,3,2. The rows below (row5-11) have 8,3,2,8,3,2, etc. So it's like the cycle is 3,2,8,3,2,8... but the middle row breaks this. Not sure.\n\nIn Example1's output, the rows above the middle row (row6) have elements in column8: 4,8,3,2,4,8. Then the middle row starts with 3. The cycle in the middle row is 3,8,4,2. So the rows above have elements that are part of the cycle, but in a different order.\n\nWait, maybe the elements above and below the middle row are part of the same cycle. For example, in Example0, the cycle is 8,3,2. The rows above have 3,2,8,3 (so 3,2,8, then back to 3). The rows below have 8,3,2,8,3,2. So perhaps the rows above are moving backward through the cycle, and the rows below are moving forward.\n\nIn Example0's rows above the middle row:\n\nRow3: 3\n\nRow2:8\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow0:3\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the middle row is the main cycle, and each row above and below takes the next element in the cycle, moving up and down. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the position of the non-zero elements in the output. For Example0, the non-zero elements in the output's rows are in the same column as the input's non-zero elements. For example, input's row4 has non-zero in columns0,1,2. Output's row4 has non-zero elements starting from column0, repeating. The other rows in the output have non-zero in column2. So maybe the pattern is to replicate the non-zero elements in a vertical and horizontal manner.\n\nAlternatively, the middle row is filled with the non-zero elements repeated horizontally. The rows above and below have those elements shifted vertically. For example, each row above has the element from the cycle shifted up by one position. But this is vague.\n\nAnother approach: notice that in Example0's output, the middle row (row4) has the sequence 8,3,2 repeated. The rows above have 3,2,8,3 in column2. The rows below have 8,3,2,8, etc., also in column2. So for the rows above and below, the third column (index2) cycles through 3,2,8,3,2,8... So the middle row starts with 8,3,2, and the rows above and below cycle through the same elements but offset.\n\nFor example, starting from the middle row:\n\nRow4: 8 (col0), 3 (col1), 2 (col2), then repeats.\n\nRow3: 3 in col2.\n\nRow2:8 in col2.\n\nRow1:2 in col2.\n\nRow0:3 in col2.\n\nThen rows5:8 in col2.\n\nRow6:3 in col2.\n\nRow7:2 in col2.\n\nRow8:8 in col2.\n\nSo the cycle is 3,8,2,3,8,2...? Or maybe it's 3,2,8 repeating. Wait, rows0:3, row1:2, row2:8, row3:3, row4:8,3,2 (middle), row5:8, row6:3, row7:2, row8:8, etc. So the cycle in the rows above and below is 3,2,8,3,2,8... But the middle row is 8,3,2. So perhaps the rows above are a reverse cycle, and the rows below are the same as the middle's cycle.\n\nAlternatively, the rows above and below are taking the elements from the middle row's cycle, but shifted. For example, the middle row's cycle is 8,3,2. The rows above and below have elements 3,2,8 in column2, repeating. Which is the same cycle but starting from the second element (3), then 2, then 8, then back to 3.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is:\n\n1. Identify the first row from the bottom that has non-zero elements. Let's call this the key row.\n\n2. Extract the non-zero elements from this key row, in order.\n\n3. The middle row of the output is this sequence repeated to fill the entire row.\n\n4. For the rows above and below the middle row, the elements in the same column as the original non-zero elements (e.g., for Example0, column2) are filled with the elements of the cycle, but shifted. The rows above start with the second element of the cycle and cycle backwards, while the rows below start with the next element and cycle forwards.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's try to apply this to the test input.\n\nTest Input's non-zero elements are in row6 (assuming rows are 0-indexed from top). Let's check:\n\nLooking at the test input rows:\n\nRow5 (index5): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, ...]\n\nRow6 (index6): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 3, 1, 0, ...]\n\nRow7 (index7): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, ...]\n\nRow8 (index8): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, ...]\n\nSo the first non-zero row from the bottom is row6, which has elements 4,2,3,1 in columns5,6,7,8 (assuming 0-indexed columns). So the non-zero elements are 4,2,3,1.\n\nFollowing the pattern from Example1, the cycle would be the elements shifted left by one: 2,3,1,4. Then, the middle row (row6) would have this cycle repeated to fill the row.\n\nThen, the rows above and below would have elements from this cycle in their respective columns.\n\nIn Example1, the rows above the middle row had elements in column8, which was the last column of the non-zero elements. For the test case, the non-zero elements are in columns5-8. So perhaps the key column is column5,6,7,8. But in the output, the middle row's cycle would start from column5 onwards. So the middle row's cycle would be 2,3,1,4 repeated, starting at column5.\n\nBut in the test input's row6, the non-zero elements are 4,2,3,1. So the sequence is 4,2,3,1. If we shift left by one, the cycle becomes 2,3,1,4. So the middle row would be filled with 2,3,1,4,2,3,1,4... starting from column5.\n\nBut the output's middle row would need to be the same length as the input rows. The test input's rows are 20 elements long. Let's see: starting from column5 (index5), the cycle would be 2,3,1,4 repeated. The first element at index5 is 2, then index6=3, index7=1, index8=4, index9=2, index10=3, and so on until the end of the row.\n\nThen, the rows above and below would have elements from this cycle in their respective columns. For example, the row above the middle row (row5) would have 3 in column5, row4 would have 1, row3 would have 4, row2 would have 2, and so on. Similarly, the rows below (row7) would have 1, row8 would have4, etc.\n\nBut let's look at Example0 and Example1 to confirm this.\n\nIn Example0, the key row is row4 (elements 8,3,2). Shifted left by one would be 3,2,8. But the middle row in the output is 8,3,2 repeated. So this contradicts the previous assumption. Therefore, the pattern might be different for even and odd numbers of elements. But this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cycle is the same as the key row's elements, but rotated in a way that the first element is moved to the end only when the number of elements is even. For Example1, which has 4 elements (even), the cycle is rotated left by one. For Example0, which has 3 elements (odd), no rotation. Then the test case, which has 4 elements (even), would be rotated left by one.\n\nBut the test case's key row has elements 4,2,3,1. So shifted left once, the cycle becomes 2,3,1,4.\n\nThen, the middle row in the output would be filled with 2,3,1,4 repeated. For example, starting from column5, which in the input's key row has 4. So in the output's middle row, column5 would be 2, column6=3, column7=1, column8=4, then column9=2, etc.\n\nThen, the rows above and below would each have a copy of the cycle, but shifted. For example, the row above the middle row (row5) would have 3 in column5, row4 would have1, row3 would have4, row2 would have2, row1 would have3, row0 would have1, etc. Similarly, rows below would have 1,4,2,3,... in their respective columns.\n\nBut in Example0, the key row's elements are 8,3,2 (three elements, odd). No rotation. So the cycle is 8,3,2. The middle row is filled with this. The rows above have 3,2,8,3 in their third column (column2). So each row above has the next element in the cycle, but starting from 3. So row3 has3, row2 has8, row1 has2, row0 has3. Then rows below have8,3,2, etc.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is:\n\n- For even number of elements in the key row: rotate left once to form the cycle.\n\n- For odd number of elements: use the original order.\n\nThen, the middle row is filled with this cycle.\n\nThe rows above and below have elements from the cycle, starting from the second element for even length, and third element for odd? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the rows above and below are filled with elements of the cycle, each row taking the next element in the cycle, but shifted by the row's distance from the middle.\n\nFor example, in Example0's output:\n\nMiddle row cycle:8,3,2.\n\nRow3 (one above middle):3.\n\nRow2:8.\n\nRow1:2.\n\nRow0:3.\n\nSo for each row above the middle, the element is taken from the cycle in reverse order, stepping back one each time.\n\nRow3: index4-1=3: 3.\n\nRow2: 8.\n\nRow1:2.\n\nRow0:3.\n\nThen, it's 3,8,2,3, which repeats every 3 rows.\n\nSimilarly, rows below:\n\nRow5:8.\n\nRow6:3.\n\nRow7:2.\n\nRow8:8.\n\nRow9:3.\n\nRow10:2.\n\nRow11:8.\n\nSo it's the cycle again, but starting from 8.\n\nBut this seems to fit the cycle 8,3,2.\n\nSo for each row above, you take the cycle in reverse order, starting from the second element (3), then 2, then 8, then 3 again.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nFor the test case:\n\nKey row elements after rotation (since even length):2,3,1,4.\n\nMiddle row filled with 2,3,1,4 repeated.\n\nRows above would start from the second element (3), then 1,4,2,3, etc.\n\nRows below would start from the next element after the middle row's cycle. For example, the middle row's cycle starts with2. So the row below (row7) would start with3, then row8 with1, row9 with4, etc.\n\nBut how to determine which column to place these elements.\n\nIn Example0 and Example1, the non-zero elements in the output's rows are placed in the same columns as the key row's non-zero elements. For example, in Example0's key row, the non-zero elements start at column0,1,2. In the output's middle row, the cycle starts at column0. The rows above and below have elements in column2. So maybe the columns where the key row's non-zero elements are located are the columns that are filled in the output.\n\nIn the test case's key row (row6), the non-zero elements are at columns5 (4), 6 (2), 7 (3), 8 (1). So columns5-8 have values4,2,3,1. So perhaps in the output, the middle row's cycle starts at column5, and the rows above and below have elements in these columns.\n\nBut in Example1's output, the non-zero elements in the rows above and below are in column8 (the last column of the key row's non-zero elements). Similarly, in Example0's output, the non-zero elements in rows above and below are in column2 (the last column of the key row's non-zero elements). So perhaps the columns used in the output's rows above and below are the last column of the key row's non-zero elements.\n\nSo in Example0, key row's non-zero elements are in columns0,1,2. The last is column2. So rows above and below have elements in column2.\n\nIn Example1, key row's non-zero elements are in columns7,8,9,10 (assuming input row6 has elements 2,3,8,4 at positions 7-10?). Wait, the input for Example1's row6 is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo the non-zero elements are at positions7 (2), 8 (3),9 (8),10 (4). So columns7-10. The last column is10. But in the output, the elements are in column8. Wait, no. Looking at Example1's output, the rows above have elements in column8. For example, row0 has4 in column8. Which corresponds to the original key row's element at position8 (3). So perhaps the columns in the output's rows are the same as the key row's columns where non-zero elements were. So each row in the output has non-zero elements in the same columns as the key row's non-zero columns.\n\nBut in Example0's output, the middle row has non-zero elements starting from column0,1,2, then repeating. The rows above and below have non-zero only in column2.\n\nBut in Example1's output, the middle row has elements in columns0-13 (the entire row), but the non-zero elements are in all columns. The rows above and below have non-zero in column8.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is:\n\n- The middle row is filled with the cycle, repeating across the entire row.\n\n- The rows above and below have non-zero elements in the same columns as the original key row's non-zero elements, but each column is filled with the cycle elements in order, shifted per row.\n\nFor example, in Example1's key row has non-zero elements in columns7-10. The output's middle row has elements in all columns, but the rows above and below have non-zero in column8, which is one of the original non-zero columns. So perhaps each column from the key row's non-zero columns is treated separately, with each column in the output's rows above and below having their own cycle.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's try to apply this to the test case.\n\nTest case's key row (row6) has non-zero elements in columns5,6,7,8. The elements are4,2,3,1.\n\nAfter rotation (even length), the cycle is 2,3,1,4.\n\nSo the middle row (row6) would be filled with 2,3,1,4,2,3,1,4,... starting from column5.\n\nThen, for each of the columns5,6,7,8:\n\n- Column5: in the middle row is2. The rows above and below would cycle through3,1,4,2,...\n\n- Column6: in the middle row is3. The rows above and below would cycle through1,4,2,3,...\n\n- Column7: in the middle row is1. The rows above and below would cycle through4,2,3,1,...\n\n- Column8: in the middle row is4. The rows above and below would cycle through2,3,1,4,...\n\nBut this would mean that each column in the output's rows above and below has its own cycle. However, looking at Example1's output, the rows above and below have non-zero elements only in column8. So perhaps only the last column of the key row's non-zero elements is used in the output's rows above and below.\n\nIn Example1's key row, the non-zero elements end at column10 (element4). The output's rows above and below have elements in column8, which is the third column of the key row's non-zero elements (columns7-10). So perhaps only the middle column is used. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the output's rows above and below, the non-zero elements are placed in the same column as the key row's first non-zero column. For Example0, the key row's first non-zero column is0. But in the output's rows above and below, the non-zero elements are in column2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's rows above and below have non-zero elements in the same column as the key row's last non-zero column. For Example0, the key row's last non-zero column is2. In the output, rows above and below have non-zero in column2. For Example1, key row's last non-zero column is10 (element4), but the output's rows have non-zero in column8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting quite complicated. Perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nAnother observation: in both examples, the output's middle row is filled with a repeating cycle derived from the key row's non-zero elements, and the rows above and below have a single non-zero element in each row, following the cycle in reverse and forward order, respectively.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nKey row non-zero elements:8,3,2.\n\nCycle:8,3,2.\n\nRows above (from middle upwards):3,2,8,3.\n\nRows below (from middle downwards):8,3,2,8.\n\nEach row has a single non-zero element in column2, cycling through the elements.\n\nFor Example1:\n\nKey row non-zero elements:2,3,8,4.\n\nCycle:3,8,4,2.\n\nRows above:4,8,3,2,4,8.\n\nRows below:2,4,8,3,2,4.\n\nEach row has a single non-zero element in column8, cycling through the elements.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- For the middle row, create a cycle by taking the key row's non-zero elements and rotating them left by one (for even length) or not rotating (for odd length).\n\n- Then, the rows above and below each have a single element per row, in the same column as the key row's last non-zero element, cycling through the elements in reverse and forward order, respectively.\n\nBut how to determine the column for the non-zero elements in the output rows.\n\nIn Example0, the key row's last non-zero column is2. So in the output, rows above and below have elements in column2.\n\nIn Example1, the key row's last non-zero column is10 (element4). But in the output, rows have elements in column8. Hmm, this doesn't align. So maybe the column is the middle column of the key row's non-zero elements.\n\nExample0's key row has non-zero elements in columns0,1,2. Middle column is1. But in the output's rows above and below, the elements are in column2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the column is the rightmost non-zero column of the key row. For Example0, that's column2. For Example1, that's column10. But in Example1's output, the elements are in column8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the column used is the column where the first element of the cycle appears in the middle row. For Example1's middle row, the cycle starts with3, which is in column7 (if the key row's non-zero elements start at column7). But in the output's rows above and below, the elements are in column8. So perhaps the column is the one where the cycle's second element appears. This is getting too vague.\n\nMaybe the key is to look for the column in the key row where the cycle's first element appears. In Example0's middle row, the cycle starts with8 in column0. The rows above and below have elements in column2. So this doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, the column used in the output's rows above and below is the column of the key row's last non-zero element. For Example0, that's column2. For Example1, that's column10. But in Example1's output, the elements are in column8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nPerhaps there's another approach. Let's think of the output as a kind of \"waterfall\" effect. The middle row has the cycle, and each row above and below shifts the cycle one position, but only in a specific column.\n\nIn Example0's output, the middle row's cycle is8,3,2. The rows above have 3,2,8,3 in column2. So each row above steps back in the cycle. The rows below have8,3,2,8 in column2, stepping forward.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1's output, the middle row's cycle is3,8,4,2. The rows above have4,8,3,2,4,8 in column8. Each row above steps back in the cycle (4 is previous to3, then8, then4, etc.), but the cycle is3,8,4,2. So stepping back would be2,4,8,3.\n\nBut the rows above in Example1's output start with4,8,3,2, which is not stepping back. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the following steps for the test case:\n\n1. Identify the key row in the test input. This is the first non-zero row from the bottom. Looking at the test input rows:\n\nRow6 (0-based index6) is [0,0,0,0,0,4,2,3,1,0,...]. This is the first row from the bottom with non-zero elements (since row7 and 8 have some non-zero but they are higher up).\n\nWait, no. Let's check the test input rows again. The test input is:\n\nRows0-19:\n\nRow5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]\n\nRow6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 3, 1, 0, ...]\n\nRow7: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, ...]\n\nRow8: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, ...]\n\nSo the key row is row6, as it's the first non-zero row from the bottom (since rows7 and 8 have non-zero elements in other positions, but row6 is the first one with consecutive non-zero elements).\n\nThe non-zero elements in row6 are at columns5 (4),6 (2),7 (3),8 (1). So the sequence is4,2,3,1.\n\nSince this is an even number of elements (4), we rotate left once to get the cycle:2,3,1,4.\n\nThe middle row (row6) will be filled with this cycle starting from column5.\n\nSo the middle row would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,2,3,1,4,2,3,1,4,2,3,1,4,2,3,1]\n\nThen, the rows above and below will have elements from this cycle in column5,6,7,8.\n\nBut according to the examples, in Example1, the rows above and below have elements only in the same column as the key row's non-zero columns. For Example1's output, the elements are in column8. But in the test case, the non-zero columns are5,6,7,8.\n\nBut perhaps the rows above and below have elements in all of these columns, following the cycle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each column in the non-zero columns will have its own cycle.\n\nFor example, column5 in the middle row has2. The rows above will have the previous element in the cycle, which is4 (since the cycle is2,3,1,4). The rows below will have3 (next element).\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Perhaps for the test case, the output's middle row is filled with the cycle2,3,1,4 repeated, and the rows above and below have the cycle elements in each of the columns5-8.\n\nBut this would require a lot of elements, and the examples show that the output is larger than the input. For example, Example0's input is 11x12, output is 12x11.\n\nWait, looking at the examples:\n\nExample0's input is 12 rows (indices0-11), each with 11 elements.\n\nThe output is 12 rows, each with 11 elements.\n\nExample1's input is15 rows (0-14), each with14 elements.\n\nOutput is15 rows, each with14 elements.\n\nSo the output has the same dimensions as the input. The test case's input is 20 rows of 20 elements each. So the output should also be 20 rows of 20 elements.\n\nGiven this, the middle row (row6 in the test case) is filled with the cycle2,3,1,4 repeated. The rows above and below have elements in columns5-8, each following the cycle.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, each of the non-zero columns in the key row (5,6,7,8) will have their own vertical cycles in the output. For example:\n\nColumn5 in the middle row is2. The rows above column5 will have3, then1, then4, then2, etc., going upwards.\n\nColumn6 in the middle row is3. The rows above column6 will have1,4,2,3, etc.\n\nColumn7 in the middle row is1. The rows above will have4,2,3,1, etc.\n\nColumn8 in the middle row is4. The rows above will have2,3,1,4, etc.\n\nSimilarly for the rows below, each column's cycle continues downward.\n\nBut this would result in a complex grid, but the examples show that only a single column is filled in the rows above and below. For Example1's output, the rows above and below have elements only in column8. So perhaps the test case's output will have elements only in column8.\n\nBut this is not certain. Given the time, perhaps the best guess is:\n\nThe test case's key row is row6 with elements4,2,3,1. Rotate left once to get cycle2,3,1,4. Middle row (row6) is filled with this cycle. The rows above and below have elements in column8 (last non-zero column of the key row) cycling through the elements.\n\nSo, in column8, the middle row has4. The rows above would cycle backwards:2, then1,3,4,2, etc. The rows below would cycle forward:1,4,2,3, etc.\n\nBut this is speculative. Alternatively, the rows above column8 would have the previous elements of the cycle. For example:\n\nRow6 (middle): column8 is4.\n\nRow5:3.\n\nRow4:1.\n\nRow3:2.\n\nRow2:4.\n\nRow1:3.\n\nRow0:1.\n\nRow7:1.\n\nRow8:4.\n\nRow9:2.\n\nRow10:3.\n\nRow11:1.\n\nRow12:4.\n\n etc.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the examples, the pattern seems to be:\n\n- The middle row has the cycle derived from the key row's non-zero elements, rotated left once if even length.\n\n- The rows above and below have elements in the same column as the key row's last non-zero column, cycling through the elements in reverse (for above) and forward (for below) order.\n\nSo for the test case:\n\nKey row's last non-zero column is8 (element1). The cycle is2,3,1,4.\n\nMiddle row's column8 is4 (since the cycle is2,3,1,4. The sequence in the middle row's columns5-8 is2,3,1,4. So column5=2, 6=3,7=1,8=4.\n\nThus, column8 is4.\n\nThe rows above (row5,4,3,2,1,0) will have the previous elements of the cycle:1,3,2,4,1,3, etc.\n\nRows below (row7,8,9,...) will have the next elements:1,4,2,3,1,4, etc.\n\nBut this is still unclear.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the best approach is to construct the test output as follows:\n\n1. Identify the key row (row6) and non-zero elements (4,2,3,1).\n\n2. Create the cycle by rotating left once:2,3,1,4.\n\n3. The middle row (row6) is filled with this cycle repeated.\n\n4. The rows above and below will have, in column8, the elements of the cycle in reverse and forward order.\n\nSo rows above row6 (rows5 to 0):\n\nRow5's column8:3 (previous element before4 in cycle is1. Wait, the cycle is2,3,1,4. The element before4 is1. So row5's column8 would be1.\n\nRow4's column8:3.\n\nRow3's column8:2.\n\nRow2's column8:4.\n\nRow1's column8:1.\n\nRow0's column8:3.\n\nRows below row6 (rows7 to 19):\n\nRow7's column8:1 (next element after4 is2.\n\nWait, the cycle is2,3,1,4. So after4 is2 again. So row7's column8:2.\n\nRow8's column8:3.\n\nRow9's column8:1.\n\nRow10's column8:4.\n\nRow11's column8:2.\n\n etc.\n\nBut this may not fit the examples. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed to create the output for the test case based on this pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input is transformed into the output. Let's start with Example 0. The input has some numbers in certain positions, and the output seems to spread those numbers in a pattern. \n\nIn Example 0's input, the non-zero numbers are in rows 2, 3, and 4. The third row (0-based index 2) has an 8 at position 2. The fourth row (index 3) has a 3 at position 2. The fifth row (index 4) has 8, 3, 2 starting at position 0. Then the output has these numbers repeated in a specific way. The middle row of the output (row 4) has the sequence 8,3,2 repeated multiple times. The rows above and below seem to be shifted versions of these numbers.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the input has non-zero numbers in rows 4,5,6,7. The sixth row (index 6) has 2,3,8,4. The output's middle row (index 6) is a repeating sequence of 3,8,4,2. The rows above and below this middle row have the numbers from the original row but shifted or arranged in a pattern.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that the middle row of the input's non-zero elements is taken, reversed, or arranged in some order, then repeated across the middle row of the output. Then the rows above and below are shifted versions of this sequence. \n\nWait, in Example 0, the input's row 4 is [8,3,2,0,...], and the output's middle row (row 4) is [8,3,2,8,3,2,...]. So it's repeating the sequence [8,3,2] starting from the left. Then the rows above and below have shifted elements. For instance, the row above middle (row 3) has [0,0,3], which is the second element of the sequence. Then row 2 has [0,0,8], the first element, and row 5 has [0,0,8], which again follows some pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the middle row of the output is a repetition of the sequence found in the input's bottom-most non-zero row. Then, the rows above and below are sequences that are the same elements but shifted upwards or downwards. Let's check Example 1. The input's bottom non-zero row is row 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,8,4]. So the sequence here is 2,3,8,4. The output's middle row (row 6) is [3,8,4,2,3,8,4,2...], which is the sequence [3,8,4,2] repeated. Wait, but where does that come from? The input row 6 has 2,3,8,4. So maybe the sequence is taken in reverse order, starting from the element after the leading zeros. Wait, the input row 6 has elements starting at position 7: 2,3,8,4. So the sequence is 2,3,8,4. The output's middle row starts with 3,8,4,2. Hmm, that's a rotation. Like, shifting the sequence to start from the second element and then appending the first element at the end. So 2,3,8,4 becomes 3,8,4,2. Then this new sequence is repeated across the row. Then the rows above and below have elements from this sequence, each shifted. For example, in Example 1's output, the row above the middle (row 5) ends with 8, which is the second element of the sequence (3,8,4,2). Then row 4 has 4, etc. But maybe the rows above the middle have the sequence elements in reverse order, going upwards. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input's bottom row (excluding leading zeros), then rotating them. For example, in Example 0's input, row 4 has 8,3,2. The output's middle row repeats 8,3,2. Then rows above have 3, then 8, then 3 again. Wait, maybe the rows above and below the middle are each shifted by one, cycling through the sequence. So the middle row is the base sequence, and each row above steps back one in the sequence, and each row below steps forward. But how does that work in the examples?\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Identify the bottom-most row in the input that has non-zero elements. This seems to be the key row for generating the output sequence.\n\nIn Example 0, the bottom non-zero row is row 4 (index 4) with [8,3,2,0,...].\n\nIn Example 1, the bottom non-zero row is row 6 (index 6) with [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,8,4,0,...]. The non-zero elements here are 2,3,8,4.\n\n2. Extract the non-zero elements from this row to form a base sequence. For Example 0: [8,3,2]; Example 1: [2,3,8,4].\n\n3. Transform this base sequence into a new sequence. In Example 0's output, the middle row is 8,3,2 repeated. But in Example 1, the middle row's sequence is 3,8,4,2. So how does [2,3,8,4] become [3,8,4,2]? It looks like a left rotation by one. Shift the elements left by one, moving the first element to the end. So 2,3,8,4 becomes 3,8,4,2. Then, this new sequence is repeated across the middle row.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: take the non-zero elements from the bottom-most non-zero row, rotate left by one (so the second element becomes first, and the first moves to the end), then repeat this sequence to fill the middle row. Then, the rows above and below the middle row each have the next element in the sequence, shifted appropriately.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nMiddle row (row 4) is 8,3,2 repeated. The rows above (rows 3,2,1,0?) have 3,8,3, etc. Wait, the output rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,3,...]\nRow 1: [0,0,2,...]\nRow 2: [0,0,8,...]\nRow 3: [0,0,3,...]\nRow 4: 8,3,2 repeating...\nRow 5: [0,0,8,...]\nRow 6: [0,0,3,...]\nRow 7: [0,0,2,...]\nRow 8: [0,0,8,...]\nRow 9: [0,0,3,...]\nRow 10: [0,0,2,...]\nRow 11: [0,0,8,...]\n\nHmm, the middle row (row4) is the base sequence. The rows above (row3, row2, row1, row0) have 3, 8, 3, 8, etc. Wait, maybe each row above and below the middle row contains the next element in the sequence, but placed in the same column as the middle row's first element. For example, in row3, the third element is 3, which is the second element of the base sequence (8,3,2). Then row2 has 8 (the first element), row1 has 2 (the third element?), but wait row1 has 2. Maybe it's cycling through the sequence upwards and downwards.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after the middle row is generated by repeating the rotated sequence, the rows above and below are generated by taking the sequence and shifting it up and down, creating a wave pattern. For example, in Example 0, the base sequence is 8,3,2. The middle row is this sequence repeated. Then the rows above have each element shifted up by one position. So row3 (above middle) has the second element (3) in the third column. Row2 has the first element (8), row1 has the third element (2), row0 has the second element (3) again. Then rows below the middle follow a similar pattern. Row5 has 8 (first element), row6 has 3 (second), row7 has 2 (third), and so on.\n\nWait, maybe the rows alternate between the elements of the sequence, moving upwards and downwards from the middle row. The middle row is the base. The row above (middle-1) has the next element in the sequence (3), then middle-2 has the next (2?), but in the example, middle-1 (row3) is 3, middle-2 (row2) is 8. Hmm, this is confusing. Let's look at Example 0's output rows:\n\nMiddle row (4): 8,3,2,8,3,2,8,3,2,8,3\n\nRows above:\n\nRow3: [0,0,3,...] (third element is 3)\nRow2: [0,0,8,...] (third element is 8)\nRow1: [0,0,2,...] (third element is 2)\nRow0: [0,0,3,...] (third element is 3)\n\nRows below:\n\nRow5: [0,0,8,...]\nRow6: [0,0,3,...]\nRow7: [0,0,2,...]\nRow8: [0,0,8,...]\nRow9: [0,0,3,...]\nRow10: [0,0,2,...]\nRow11: [0,0,8,...]\n\nHmm, so starting from the middle row, moving up, the third column cycles through 8 (row4), 3 (row3), 8 (row2), 3 (row1), 3 (row0). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the middle row is the main sequence, and the rows above and below each have the next element in the sequence in the same column where the sequence starts. For example, in Example 0, the middle row starts with 8 in column0. The rows above and below have elements in column2. Wait, but in the output rows, the non-zero elements are in column2. So maybe the sequence is written in the middle row starting from column0, but the rows above and below have the elements shifted into column2. That doesn't fit. Let me check the output again.\n\nIn Example0's output, the middle row (row4) has 8,3,2 starting at column0. Then the rows above and below have non-zero elements in column2. So maybe the middle row is the full sequence, and the other rows have a single element from the sequence in column2, but which element?\n\nLooking at the rows above middle:\n\nRow4 (middle): columns 0,1,2: 8,3,2 (sequence starts here)\nRow3: column2 is 3 (second element)\nRow2: column2 is 8 (first element)\nRow1: column2 is 2 (third element)\nRow0: column2 is 3 (second element again)\n\nThen below middle:\n\nRow5: column2 is 8 (first element)\nRow6: column2 is 3 (second)\nRow7: column2 is 2 (third)\nRow8: column2 is 8 (first)\nRow9: column2 is 3 (second)\nRow10: column2 is 2 (third)\nRow11: column2 is 8 (first)\n\nSo it's cycling through the sequence elements in column2, starting from 3 (row3), then 8 (row2), 2 (row1), 3 (row0). Then for rows below, starting with row5 (8), row6 (3), row7 (2), etc.\n\nSo the pattern for the non-middle rows is that each row's column2 has an element from the sequence, cycling backwards (for rows above) and forwards (for rows below). Wait, how? Let's see:\n\nThe sequence is [8,3,2]. For rows above middle:\n\nRow3 (middle-1) has 3 (element 1)\nRow2 (middle-2) has 8 (element 0)\nRow1 (middle-3) has 2 (element 2)\nRow0 (middle-4) has 3 (element1 again)\n\nFor rows below middle:\n\nRow5 (middle+1) has 8 (element0)\nRow6 (middle+2) has 3 (element1)\nRow7 (middle+3) has 2 (element2)\nRow8 (middle+4) has 8 (element0 again)\n\nSo it's cycling through the sequence elements in reverse order for rows above (starting from element1, then element0, then element2, then element1 again) and in normal order for rows below (element0, element1, element2, element0, etc.).\n\nHmm, that's a bit complex. So the key steps are:\n\n1. Find the bottom-most row with non-zero elements in the input. Extract those elements (ignoring leading zeros) as the base sequence.\n\n2. Rotate this base sequence left by one to form the new sequence. For example, [8,3,2] becomes [3,2,8] (if rotated left by one)? Wait, in Example0's output, the middle row is [8,3,2,...] repeated. Wait, the input's base sequence is [8,3,2], and the output's middle row is the same sequence repeated. But in Example1, the input's base sequence is [2,3,8,4], and the output's middle row is [3,8,4,2], which is a left rotation. So the rotation is left by one. So the first element is moved to the end. For example, [2,3,8,4] becomes [3,8,4,2].\n\nSo step 2 is: rotate the base sequence left by one to create the new sequence for repetition.\n\n3. The middle row of the output is this new sequence repeated as many times as needed to fill the row.\n\n4. For the other rows (above and below), in each row, at the same column where the middle row starts (column0 in Example0, column7 in Example1), place the elements of the new sequence in a pattern that cycles through the elements. But in the examples, the non-middle rows have non-zero elements in a different column. For example, in Example0's output, the non-middle rows have non-zero in column2, whereas the middle row starts at column0. Wait, that doesn't align. Let me check the outputs again.\n\nIn Example0's input, the non-zero elements are in row4 (columns0,1,2: 8,3,2). In the output, the middle row (row4) has 8,3,2 starting at column0. The other rows have non-zero in column2. So maybe the column is determined by the input's original position of the sequence. But in the output, the middle row starts at column0, but other rows have non-zero in column2. That's confusing. Maybe the column is the same as the original's start. For example, in Example0's input, the sequence starts at column0 (row4 has 8 in column0). In the output's middle row, it starts at column0. But the other rows have their non-zero elements at column2. Hmm, that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero elements in the output's non-middle rows are placed in the same column as the original non-zero elements from the input. For example, in Example0's input, the original non-zero elements are in column2 for rows2 and 3, and columns0-2 for row4. The output's non-middle rows have non-zero in column2. So perhaps the output's non-middle rows place their elements in the same column as the original's highest non-zero row. For example, in Example0, the first non-zero row (row2) has a 8 in column2. So the output's non-middle rows place their elements in column2. Similarly, in Example1's input, the original non-zero elements are in columns8 and 7-10. The output's non-middle rows have their elements in column8 (for example, rows4,5, etc. in the output have non-zero in column8). So the column is determined by the original column of the highest non-zero row.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- Find the highest row (smallest index) in the input that has non-zero elements. Take the column where those elements are (for example, column2 in Example0, column8 in Example1).\n\n- The base sequence is the non-zero elements from the bottom-most row, rotated left by one.\n\n- The middle row of the output is this rotated sequence repeated to fill the row, starting from the original column of the highest non-zero row.\n\n- The other rows have the elements of the rotated sequence in the same column, cycling through the elements in reverse order (for rows above the middle) and normal order (for rows below).\n\nWait, in Example0:\n\n- Highest non-zero row (excluding the bottom row) is row2, column2.\n\n- The rotated sequence is [3,2,8] (original sequence [8,3,2] rotated left by one would be [3,2,8]? Wait, rotating left once would shift each element left, with the first element moved to the end. So 8,3,2 \u2192 3,2,8. But in Example0's output, the middle row is [8,3,2,8,3,2...]. So that contradicts. Therefore, maybe the rotation is not applied here. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, in Example1's input, the bottom row (row6) has elements starting at column7: 2,3,8,4. Rotated left by one becomes 3,8,4,2, which is exactly the sequence in the middle row of the output. So that works. But in Example0's input, the bottom row (row4) has 8,3,2. Rotated left by one would be 3,2,8. But the middle row of the output in Example0 is 8,3,2 repeated. So that's not matching. So maybe the rotation is only applied in Example1 but not in Example0? That can't be. There must be a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rotation is applied only when the length of the base sequence is even? But in Example0, the length is 3 (odd), Example1 is 4 (even). But that doesn't explain why Example0's middle row is the original sequence.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck. Example0's input has row4 as [8,3,2,0,...]. So the non-zero elements are 8,3,2. The output's middle row is [8,3,2,8,3,2,...]. So the rotated sequence would be the same as the original? That would happen if the rotation is zero. But why is Example1 different?\n\nAh! Maybe the rotation is determined by the position of the highest non-zero row. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, the highest non-zero row (other than the bottom) is row2 (column2:8), row3 (column2:3), and row4 (columns0-2:8,3,2). The bottom row is row4. The sequence is 8,3,2. The output's middle row is 8,3,2 repeated. So no rotation here.\n\nIn Example1, the highest non-zero rows are row4 (column8:4), row5 (column8:8), row6 (columns7-10:2,3,8,4), row7 (column8:2). The bottom row is row6. The sequence is 2,3,8,4. The output's middle row is 3,8,4,2 repeated. So this is the original sequence rotated left by one. \n\nSo why is Example0 not rotated, but Example1 is rotated? Maybe the rotation is applied when the sequence is longer than a certain length, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the rotation is applied when the highest non-zero row is not the same as the bottom row. Wait, in Example0, the highest non-zero row is row2 (8), then row3 (3), then row4 (8,3,2). The bottom row is row4. So maybe the sequence is taken as the bottom row, but the rotation depends on the number of non-zero rows above it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rotation is determined by the number of elements in the base sequence. Example0 has 3 elements, which when rotated left by one would be 3,2,8. But the output uses the original sequence. Example1's base sequence of 4 elements is rotated left by one. So maybe for even-length sequences, rotate left by one, for odd lengths, no rotation? But 3 is odd, and no rotation. 4 is even, rotated. Let's see.\n\nIf that's the case, then for the test input, which has a sequence of 4 elements (from row6 in the test input?), then it would be rotated left by one.\n\nBut first, let's process the test input. The test input has non-zero elements in row5 (4 at column6), row6 (4,2,3,1 starting at column5?), row7 (3 at column6), row8 (1 at column6). The bottom-most non-zero row is row6: columns5,6,7,8: 4,2,3,1. So the base sequence is 4,2,3,1. Then rotated left by one would be 2,3,1,4. Then the middle row of the output would be this sequence repeated. Then the other rows would have elements from this sequence in the same column (column5?), cycling through.\n\nBut wait, the test input's row6 is [0,0,0,0,0,4,2,3,1,0,...]. So the non-zero elements start at column5 (assuming columns are 0-based). The elements are 4,2,3,1. Rotated left by one gives 2,3,1,4. So the middle row would be this sequence repeated. Then the rows above and below would have elements in column6 (since the highest non-zero row in the input is row5 (column6 is 4?), but wait, row5 in the test input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,...]. So the non-zero is at column6. So the highest non-zero row (other than the bottom row) is row5 (column6:4). So the column for the output's non-middle rows would be column6.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n1. Identify the bottom-most non-zero row in the input. For test input, it's row6 with elements 4,2,3,1 starting at column5.\n\n2. Rotate left by one to get the base sequence: 2,3,1,4.\n\n3. The middle row of the output will be this sequence repeated, starting from column5.\n\n4. The other rows (above and below) will have elements in column6 (since the highest non-zero row in the input is row5 with column6).\n\nWait, but in the training examples, the non-middle rows use the column from the highest non-zero row. For example, in Example0, the highest non-zero row (other than the bottom row) is row2, column2. So the non-middle rows in the output have elements in column2. For Example1, the highest non-zero rows are row4 (column8) and row5 (column8), so the non-middle rows in the output have elements in column8.\n\nSo applying this to the test input, the highest non-zero row (other than the bottom row) is row5 (column6). So the non-middle rows in the output will have their non-zero elements in column6.\n\nSo the middle row (row6 in the output) will have the rotated sequence (2,3,1,4) repeated, starting from column5. Then, each row above and below will have elements in column6, cycling through the rotated sequence. For rows above the middle, starting from the element before the middle's starting element. Let's see:\n\nThe rotated sequence is [2,3,1,4].\n\nMiddle row (row6 in the output) starts at column5: 2,3,1,4,2,3,1,4,... \n\nThe rows above (row5,4,3, etc.) will have in column6 the elements of the sequence in order, but perhaps shifted. For example, row5 (just above middle) would have 3 (next element after 2). Then row4 would have 1, then row3 would have 4, then row2 would have 2 again, and so on. Similarly, rows below (row7,8, etc.) would have the next elements in the sequence.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the rows above the middle cycle through the sequence elements in reverse order. For example, the middle row's first element is 8. The row above (row3) has 3, which is the second element. Then row2 has 8 again (first element), row1 has 2 (third), row0 has 3 again. So it's cycling backwards. Maybe the pattern is that the rows above the middle cycle the sequence backwards, and the rows below cycle forwards.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nMiddle row (row6) sequence: [2,3,1,4] repeated.\n\nRows above (row5, row4, row3, etc.) in column6:\n\nRow5 (above middle) would have 4 (last element of the sequence?), then row4 has 1, row3 has 3, row2 has 2, row1 has4 again, etc.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's look at Example1 again. The rotated sequence is [3,8,4,2]. Middle row (row6) has this sequence repeated. The rows above:\n\nRow5 (above middle) has 8 (column8: second element of the sequence). Row4 has 4 (third element). Row3 has 2 (fourth). Row2 has 3 (first again). Wait, in Example1's output, the rows above middle have:\n\nRow5 (just above middle): column8 is 8 (second element of the sequence [3,8,4,2]).\n\nRow4: column8 is 4 (third element).\n\nRow3: column8 is 2 (fourth element).\n\nRow2: column8 is 3 (first element again).\n\nRow1: column8 is 8 (second again).\n\nSo it's cycling through the sequence in reverse order. So the rows above the middle row take the sequence elements in reverse order, starting from the second element (8), then third (4), then fourth (2), then first (3), then repeats.\n\nSimilarly, rows below the middle:\n\nRow7: column8 is 2 (fourth element).\n\nRow8: column8 is4 (third).\n\nRow9: column8 is8 (second).\n\nRow10: column8 is3 (first).\n\nRow11: column8 is2 (fourth again).\n\nSo again cycling through the sequence in reverse order.\n\nWait, but in the middle row, the sequence is [3,8,4,2]. The rows above and below are cycling through the elements in the order 8,4,2,3, which is the original sequence without the first element. Or perhaps it's the sequence shifted left by one. Wait, the sequence is [3,8,4,2]. The elements in rows above are 8,4,2,3, which is the sequence starting from the second element, then third, then fourth, then first. So it's a cyclic shift of the original sequence, starting from the second element.\n\nSo for the rows above the middle, the elements in the designated column are the sequence elements starting from the second element and cycling through. For rows below, perhaps it's the same.\n\nBut in Example0, the sequence is [8,3,2]. The rows above have 3,8,2,3. The sequence is [8,3,2]. Starting from the second element (3), then first (8), then third (2), then second (3) again. So for odd-length sequences, the cycle is different.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated, but the key points seem to be:\n\n- Extract the non-zero elements from the bottom-most row, rotate left by one to form the middle row's sequence.\n\n- The middle row starts at the same column as the bottom row's first non-zero element.\n\n- The other rows have elements in the column of the highest non-zero row (other than the bottom row).\n\n- The elements in these other rows cycle through the rotated sequence, starting from the second element for rows above, and continuing in order.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nBottom row is row6: elements starting at column5:4,2,3,1 \u2192 sequence [4,2,3,1]. Rotate left by one \u2192 [2,3,1,4].\n\nMiddle row (row6) of the output will be [2,3,1,4,2,3,1,4,...] starting at column5.\n\nThe highest non-zero row in the input is row5 (column6 has 4). So the other rows will have their non-zero elements in column6.\n\nThe sequence for these rows is [2,3,1,4]. Starting from the second element (3), then 1, then 4, then 2, then repeat.\n\nSo the rows above the middle (row5, row4, row3, etc.) will have:\n\nRow5: column6 \u21923\n\nRow4: column6 \u21921\n\nRow3: column6 \u21924\n\nRow2: column6 \u21922\n\nRow1: column6 \u21923\n\nRow0: column6 \u21921\n\nAnd the rows below the middle (row7, row8, row9, etc.) will have:\n\nRow7: column6 \u21921\n\nRow8: column6 \u21924\n\nRow9: column6 \u21922\n\nRow10: column6 \u21923\n\nRow11: column6 \u21921\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut the output's rows are the same number as the input's rows. The test input has 20 rows. So the output should have 20 rows. The middle row would be row9 or something? Wait, the test input's rows are 20 rows (0-19). The bottom row with non-zero is row6. So the middle row is row6. The output's rows would then have:\n\nMiddle row (row6) filled with the rotated sequence [2,3,1,4] starting at column5.\n\nThe other rows (rows 0-5 and 7-19) have in column6 the elements of the rotated sequence in the order 3,1,4,2 repeating upwards and downwards.\n\nSo for example:\n\nRow5 (above middle): column6 \u21923\n\nRow4: column6 \u21921\n\nRow3: column6 \u21924\n\nRow2: column6 \u21922\n\nRow1: column6 \u21923\n\nRow0: column6 \u21921\n\nRow7 (below middle): column6 \u21921\n\nRow8: column6 \u21924\n\nRow9: column6 \u21922\n\nRow10: column6 \u21923\n\nRow11: column6 \u21921\n\nRow12: column6 \u21924\n\n...and so on until row19.\n\nPutting this all together, the output would have the middle row filled with the rotated sequence, and all other rows having the corresponding element in column6.",
