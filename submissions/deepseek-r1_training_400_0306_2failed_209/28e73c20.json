        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grid of all zeros into the output grids provided in the training examples, and then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nFirst, I'll start by carefully examining the training examples to identify any common structures or transformations. Let's look at Example 0. The input is a 6x6 grid of zeros. The output is a grid where the borders (first and last rows and columns) are filled with 3s. The second row starts with all 0s except the last element, which is 3. The third row starts with 3s but then turns to 0s towards the end. This seems like a spiral pattern moving inward. \n\nLooking at the other examples, like Example 1 (8x8), the output also forms a spiral. The outer layer is all 3s, then the next layer starts with 0s and a 3 in the corner, then another spiral of 3s, and so on, creating a sort of maze-like structure. Each subsequent layer alternates between 3s and 0s, spiraling inward. \n\nAnother observation: the number of layers in the spiral seems related to the grid's size. For even-sized grids, like 6x6, the spiral has layers, each two rows/columns thick. For example, in the 6x6 grid, there are three layers (since 6/2=3). Each layer alternates between 3s and 0s, creating a sort of concentric square pattern. \n\nLet me check Example 4, which is 10x10. The output starts with a border of 3s. Then the next layer has 0s except the last element. The third row has 3s again but stops before the last column. This continues, creating a spiral that tightens each time. The pattern seems to be creating a spiral where each turn is at a certain step, perhaps decreasing the length as it moves inward.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, the first row is all 3s. The second row starts with zeros except the last element. Then the third row has 3s up to a certain point, then 0, then 3. It looks like each subsequent layer is indented by one position and alternates between 3 and 0. The spiral seems to be turning corners, creating a path that winds inward, with 3s forming the walls and 0s forming the path.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps for a general case. Suppose we have an N x N grid. The algorithm might be:\n\n1. Start at the outer layer, setting all elements to 3.\n2. Move inward by one layer. The next layer (second from the outside) starts with 0s except the last element in the row, which is 3.\n3. The next layer (third from outside) alternates again, creating a 3s path that turns inward, leaving a trail of 0s in certain positions.\n4. This process continues, creating a spiral that alternates between 3s and 0s, each time moving inward and creating a smaller square.\n\nBut how exactly are the 3s and 0s placed? Let's look at the 6x6 example. The output's structure is:\n\nRow 0: all 3s.\nRow 1: all 0s except last element is 3.\nRow 2: starts with four 3s, then 0, then 3.\nRow 3: 3, 0, two 3s, 0, 3.\nRow 4: 3, 0s, then 3.\nRow 5: all 3s.\n\nHmm. It's like creating a spiral that goes clockwise. Starting from the top, then moving right, down, left, up, etc., each time reducing the length of the steps. But in the output grids, the 3s form the perimeter and then create a spiral that turns inward, with 0s filling the path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a Ulam spiral-like pattern but with 3s and 0s. But the examples don't seem to follow a number sequence. Instead, the pattern is more about creating concentric squares that spiral inward, alternating between being filled with 3s and 0s, except for a single path that allows movement inward.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the layers. For each layer (starting from the outermost), the direction alternates. The first layer is all 3s. The next layer (moving inward) has a 0 path that starts from the second row, first column, moves right, then down, then left, then up, but with certain steps. Wait, maybe each time the spiral turns, it leaves a 0 in certain positions and fills the rest with 3s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each ring (level) in the grid, certain rows and columns are set to 3s, creating a spiral. For example, in the first ring (outermost), all elements are 3s. The next ring (moving inward) leaves a corridor of 0s that spirals inward. The next ring fills with 3s again, but leaves a corridor, and so on.\n\nWait, looking at the 6x6 output:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,3]\nRow 2: [3,3,3,3,0,3]\nRow 3: [3,0,3,3,0,3]\nRow 4: [3,0,0,0,0,3]\nRow 5: [3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nThe spiral starts at the top right corner (Row 0, all 3s). Then, Row 1 has all 0s except the last element. Then Row 2 has 3s until the fourth element, then 0, then 3. Then Row 3 starts with 3, then 0, then two 3s, then 0, then 3. It seems like the spiral is moving clockwise, creating a path that goes down, then left, then up, then right, each time leaving a trail of 0s and then filling the next part with 3s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each layer is a square that is drawn with 3s, but with a \"notch\" that allows a path to the next inner layer. The notches are placed in a way that creates a spiral. For example, the first layer (outer) is all 3s. The next layer is a square shifted inward by 1, but with a missing part (0s) to create a path. Then the next layer shifts again, with another notch, etc.\n\nLet me consider how the notches are placed. In Example 0, the second row (row 1) has all 0s except the last element. Then row 2 starts with 3s but ends with 0 and 3. This suggests that the path starts at the end of row 1 and turns down into row 2, then left, then up, etc.\n\nAnother observation: the outputs have all 3s in the first and last rows. The second row from the top has all 0s except the last element. Then the next rows have a mix of 3s and 0s, forming a kind of corridor that winds inward.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that each ring (starting from the outermost) is filled with 3s except for a single path that allows moving into the next inner ring. The path alternates direction each layer. For example, the first path (from the outer ring to the next) is a vertical strip on the rightmost column. The next path is a horizontal strip at the bottom of the inner ring, then left, then up, creating a spiral.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe first ring (outer) is all 3s. Then, moving inward, the next ring has a vertical path along the rightmost column (rows 1-4 in column 5). Then, the next ring (even further inward) has a horizontal path along the bottom (row 4, columns 1-4), but the 0s are in row 4, columns 1-4. Hmm, maybe that's not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, each layer is a square that is offset by a certain amount, and the path is created by leaving a 0 in certain positions to connect the layers.\n\nLet me think about how the layers are structured. For example, in the 6x6 grid:\n\n- The outermost layer is rows 0 and 5, columns 0-5 (all 3s).\n- The next layer is rows 1 and 4, columns 1-4. But in this case, row 1 has 0s except column 5 (which is part of the outer layer). So perhaps the next layer starts at row 1, column 0-4, but row 1's columns 0-4 are 0s, except the last column is 3 (which is part of the outer layer). Then row 2 has 3s in columns 0-3, then 0 and 3. So maybe the next inner layer is a square starting at row 2, column 2, etc.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe there's a recursive pattern here. For example, each time you move inward by one layer, the direction of the spiral changes, and the path is created by leaving 0s in specific positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is based on the parity of the layer. For even layers (counting from the outside), the entire perimeter is filled with 3s, and for odd layers, certain paths are left as 0s to allow spiraling inward.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where the output changes from 3 to 0. For example, in the 6x6 output, the first row is all 3s. The second row (row 1) has 0s except column 5. Row 2 has 3s up to column 3, then 0 and 3. Row 3 starts with 3, then 0, then 3s until column 3, then 0 and 3. This suggests that each layer is created by moving inward and creating a path that turns left each time.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is similar to the way a spiral is drawn in a grid, where you move right, down, left, up, and repeat, each time reducing the steps. But instead of filling numbers, you're filling 3s except for a path of 0s that allows the spiral to form.\n\nIn programming terms, when drawing a spiral, you might have variables tracking the current direction and the remaining steps. Maybe here, the 3s form the walls of the spiral, and the 0s are the path. For example, starting from the top right, the path moves down, then left, then up, then right, each time the steps decreasing by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe path starts at row 1, column 5 (the last element of row 1). Then moves down to row 4, column 5. Then turns left to row 4, column 1. Then up to row 3, column 1. Then right to row 3, column 4. Then down again? Not sure. Alternatively, the 0s form a path that winds inward, and the 3s block other paths.\n\nAlternatively, each layer is created by drawing a square of 3s, but leaving a gap (0s) in the appropriate position to allow the spiral to continue inward. For example:\n\n- The outermost layer is all 3s.\n- The next layer (inside) is a square shifted by one in each direction, but the top row of this inner square has a gap (0s) starting from the second row, first column, moving right, then down, etc.\n\nBut how to determine where the gaps are?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the second row (row 1) has all 0s except column 5. This creates a vertical gap along the rightmost column. Then row 2 has 3s up to column 3, then 0 and 3. This suggests that after moving down along the rightmost column (column 5), the next gap is a horizontal one along row 2, starting from column 4 to column 3 (since row 2 has 3s up to column 3, then 0, then 3). Wait, that's not exactly. Let me recheck:\n\nRow 2 is [3,3,3,3,0,3]. So columns 0-3 are 3s, column 4 is 0, column 5 is 3. So the gap is at column 4. Then row 3 is [3,0,3,3,0,3]. So columns 0 is 3, column 1 is 0, then columns 2-3 are 3s, column 4 is 0, column 5 is 3. Hmm, maybe the gaps are at column 4 in row 2, column 1 and 4 in row 3, etc. This is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that each even-numbered layer (counting from the outside) is filled with 3s, and each odd layer has a path of 0s that allows movement to the next layer. The path spirals inward, and each time it turns, it leaves a 0 in a specific position.\n\nAnother approach: notice that in all outputs, the first and last rows are all 3s. The second row has all 0s except the last element. Then the next row has 3s except for the penultimate element (column n-2) being 0, followed by 3. Then the following rows may have 0s in specific positions to create the spiral.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is similar to creating a maze where the walls are 3s and the paths are 0s. The maze is a spiral that winds inward, with each turn creating a new layer of walls.\n\nLet's consider the 8x8 example (Example 1). The output's second row (row 1) has all 0s except the last column. Row 2 has 3s up to column 6, then 0 and 3. Row 3 has 3, then 0s up to column 5, then 3, 0, 3. This seems like after moving down the rightmost column (row 1 to row 6), the path turns left (columns 6 to 2?), but the exact pattern is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is determined by layers. For each layer i (starting from 0), if i is even, the layer is filled with 3s; if i is odd, certain positions are 0s to allow the spiral. But this might not hold for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, think of the grid as having concentric squares. Each square is two cells thick. For example, in a 6x6 grid (3 layers), each layer alternates between 3s and 0s. But looking at the examples, this doesn't quite fit. For example, in the 6x6 output, the first layer is all 3s (layer 0). The next layer (layer 1) has a vertical path of 0s along the rightmost column (except the top and bottom). Then layer 2 has a horizontal path along the bottom of that layer. This creates a spiral effect.\n\nPerhaps the algorithm is to create a spiral where each turn reduces the length by one, and the direction alternates between right, down, left, up. The 0s mark the path of the spiral, and the 3s are the walls.\n\nAnother observation: the number of 3s in each row corresponds to the spiral's current direction. For example, in the 6x6 output:\n\nRow 0: all 3s (outermost layer)\nRow 1: 0s except last column (path starts here)\nRow 2: 3s except the fifth column (0) and last (3)\nRow 3: 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3\nRow 4: 3, 0s except last column\nRow 5: all 3s\n\nThis looks like the spiral starts at the top-right corner, moves down along the rightmost column (row 1 to row 4), then left along row 4 columns 4 to 1, then up along column 1 rows 3 to 2, then right along row 2 columns 2 to 4, but that doesn't exactly match. Maybe it's easier to see the path of 0s.\n\nThe 0s in the 6x6 output form a path that starts at row 1, column 5 (last element of row 1), then moves down to row 4, column 5 (all zeros in column 5 from row 1 to row 4), then turns left into row 4, column 4 to column 1 (row 4 has 0s in columns 1-4), then up to row 3, column 1 (row 3 has 0 at column 1), then right to column 3 (row 3, column 4 is 0?), but this is getting messy.\n\nAlternatively, the 0s form a spiral path that allows movement from the outer edge towards the center. Each time the spiral turns, a new layer is created with 0s in a specific direction.\n\nAnother idea: the output grid is generated by a process that starts from the top-right corner and creates a spiral path inward, turning right at each corner, and filling the rest with 3s. The path is made of 0s, and each segment of the path is shorter by one each time.\n\nFor example, in the 6x6 output:\n\n- The path starts at row 0, column 5 (but row 0 is all 3s, so maybe the entrance is row 1, column 5).\n- From row 1, column 5, the path moves down to row 4, column 5 (since row 1 to row 4's column 5 are 0s except row 4's column 5 is 3? Wait, no. Row 1's column 5 is 3, rows 2-4's column 5 are 3s except row 1's is 3. Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, the path of 0s starts at row 1, columns 0-4 (all zeros), then turns into column 5, row 1-4? No, row 1's column 5 is 3, but row 1's other columns are 0.\n\nThis is quite tricky. Let me try to outline the steps for the 6x6 example:\n\nRow 0: all 3s (border)\nRow 1: all 0s except last column (3)\nRow 2: 3s in columns 0-3, 0, 3\nRow 3: 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3\nRow 4: 3, 0s in columns 1-4, 3\nRow 5: all 3s\n\nThe 0s form a spiral path that starts in row 1 (columns 0-4), then turns down along column 4 (row 2-3 have 0s in column 4?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the path is:\n\nRow 1: left to right (columns 0-4) are 0s, leading to column 5 (3) \u2014 but this doesn't form a path. Maybe the path is moving from the top-left to the top-right, then down the right side, but the zeros are in row 1, which might be the entry point.\n\nAlternatively, the spiral is created by starting at the top, moving right, then down, then left, then up, but each time the length of the movement decreases. For example:\n\n- Move right along row 0 (all 3s).\n- Then move down along column 5 (all 3s except row 1-4).\nWait, but row 1's column 5 is 3, which is part of the outer layer. So perhaps the spiral starts inside the outer layer.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's think of the output as layers:\n\nLayer 0: outermost (all 3s)\nLayer 1: next layer inward, which has a path of 0s leading inward\nLayer 2: next layer with 3s and another path of 0s\n\nIn the 6x6 example:\n\n- Layer 0 is rows 0 and 5, columns 0-5 (all 3s)\n- Layer 1 is rows 1-4, columns 1-4. Within this layer, row 1 (of the entire grid) has 0s except column 5 (which is layer 0). So perhaps layer 1's path starts at row 1, column 4 (which is 0) and moves down to row 4, column 4 (which is 0). Then turns left to column 1, row 4 (0s in columns 1-4 of row 4). Then up to row 2, column 1 (0 in row 3, column 1), etc.\n\nBut how to generalize this for any grid size?\n\nAnother approach: the output for even-sized grids (like 6x6) and odd-sized grids (like 13x13 in Example 3) have similar patterns. For example, the 13x13 output has a more complex spiral with more layers.\n\nLooking at the 10x10 example (Example 4), the output shows a spiral with multiple turns, each time creating a new layer of 3s and 0s. The pattern seems to alternate between horizontal and vertical 0s paths, each time moving inward.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that for each layer, starting from the outermost, the direction of the spiral path changes (right, down, left, up), and the path length decreases by a certain amount each time. The 0s form the path that allows moving inward, while the 3s form the walls.\n\nTo formalize this, perhaps the algorithm is as follows:\n\n1. Initialize the entire grid to 3s (the outermost layer).\n2. For each subsequent layer (moving inward), create a path of 0s that allows the spiral to turn inward.\n3. The path alternates direction each layer (right, down, left, up), and the length of the path decreases as we move inward.\n\nBut how to determine where to place the 0s? Let's consider the first few steps:\n\n- Start with the outermost layer (all 3s).\n- The first inward path (layer 1) is a horizontal path along the second row, columns 0 to n-2 (assuming 0-based index), leaving the last column as 3. This allows entering the inner layer from the right side.\n- Then, the next path (layer 2) is vertical along the column n-2, rows 1 to n-2, leaving the last row as 3.\n- Then, a horizontal path to the left along row n-2, columns n-3 to 1.\n- Then a vertical path up along column 1, rows n-3 to 2.\n- Continue this pattern, each time reducing the length of the path by 2 or similar.\n\nApplying this to Example 0 (6x6):\n\n- Layer 0: all 3s.\n- Layer 1: row 1, columns 0-4 (all 0s), column 5 is 3 (part of layer 0).\n- Layer 2: row 2, columns 0-3 (3s), then 0 in column 4, 3 in column 5.\n- Layer 3: row 3, columns 0 is 3, then 0 in column 1, 3s in 2-3, 0 in 4, 3 in 5.\n- Layer 4: row 4, columns 0 is 3, columns 1-4 are 0s, column 5 is 3.\n- Layer 5: row 5 is all 3s.\n\nThis seems to create a spiral path where each layer alternates between horizontal and vertical paths of 0s, allowing the spiral to turn inward.\n\nBut how to generalize this for any grid size? Let's look for a pattern in the outputs.\n\nIn Example 0 (6x6):\n\n- The first inner layer (row 1) has 5 zeros followed by a 3.\n- The next layer (row 2) has four 3s, then a 0 and a 3.\n- Row 3: 3, 0, two 3s, 0, 3.\n- Row 4: 3, four 0s, 3.\n- Row 5: all 3s.\n\nThis seems like the spiral has two main directions: horizontal and vertical. Each time, the path alternates between these directions and reduces the length by one.\n\nFor the 8x8 example (Example 1):\n\n- Row 1: seven 0s and a 3.\n- Row 2: six 3s, then 0 and 3.\n- Row 3: 3, then six 0s, then 0 and 3.\n- Row 4: 3, 0, then four 3s, 0, 3.\n- And so on.\n\nThe pattern here is that each even-numbered row (starting from 0) has a certain number of 3s followed by 0s and 3s, creating a spiral.\n\nAnother approach: each row in the output is determined by its distance from the top and bottom, and the current spiral step. For example, the first and last rows are all 3s. The second and penultimate rows have a certain pattern based on the spiral's direction.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is generated by creating a spiral that starts at the top-right corner, moves down, then left, then up, then right, each time with a shorter length, and leaving 0s in those paths while the rest are 3s.\n\nTo model this, perhaps the algorithm is:\n\n1. Fill the entire grid with 3s.\n2. Create a spiral path of 0s that starts at the top-right corner and moves inward, turning clockwise.\n3. The path starts by moving down a certain number of steps, then left, then up, then right, each time reducing the steps by one.\n4. This process repeats until the center is reached.\n\nBut how to translate this into the actual grid positions?\n\nFor example, in the 6x6 grid:\n\n- The path starts at row 0, column 5 (top-right). But since row 0 is all 3s, maybe the entrance is row 1, column 5.\n- Move down from row 1 to row 4 (rows 1-4) in column 5. But row 1, column 5 is 3, which is part of the outer layer. So this doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the path is along the 0s.\n\nWait, in row 1 of the 6x6 output, the columns 0-4 are 0s. Column 5 is 3. So the path is along row 1, columns 0-4, leading to column 5 (3). Then row 2 has 3s up to column 3, then 0 and 3. So the path turns down from row 1 to row 2, column 4 (which is 0). Then moves left along row 2, column 4 to column 3 (which is 3?), not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 0s form a path that snakes through the grid. For example, in the 6x6 output, the path of 0s is:\n\n- Row 1, columns 0-4 (0s)\n- Row 2, column 4 (0)\n- Row 3, column 4 (0)\n- Row 4, columns 1-4 (0s)\n- Row 3, column 1 (0)\n- Row 2, column 1 (0)\n\nThis forms a spiral that starts at row 1, moves right, then down, then left, then up, etc.\n\nBut this seems a bit forced. Maybe the key is to recognize that the output is a spiral where each turn is marked by a 0, and the rest of the grid is filled with 3s.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each even-numbered layer (starting from 0) is filled with 3s, and each odd-numbered layer has a spiral path of 0s leading inward. The layers are concentric squares, each two cells thick.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to find a mathematical pattern.\n\nLooking at the examples, the output grids have a certain symmetry. For instance, in the 6x6 output, rows 0 and 5 are all 3s, rows 1 and 4 have 0s in certain positions, rows 2 and 3 have more complex patterns. This suggests that the grid is symmetric around its center.\n\nAnother observation: the number of 3s in each row decreases as you move towards the center and then increases again. For example, in the 8x8 output:\n\n- Row 0: 8 3s\n- Row 1: 7 0s and 1 3\n- Row 2: 6 3s, 1 0, 1 3\n- Row 3: 1 3, 5 0s, 1 3, 1 0, 1 3\n- And so on.\n\nThis suggests a pattern where each row alternates between having a block of 3s followed by 0s and then 3s again, with the positions of the blocks shifting inward each layer.\n\nPerhaps the pattern can be described by layers, where each layer i (starting from 0) has:\n\n- For even i: fill the current layer with 3s.\n- For odd i: create a path of 0s in the current layer.\n\nBut how to define the layers? For example, in the 6x6 grid, layers are:\n\nLayer 0: outermost (rows 0 and 5, columns 0-5)\nLayer 1: rows 1 and 4, columns 1-4\nLayer 2: rows 2 and 3, columns 2-3\n\nEach layer is a square two rows/columns thick. For even layers (0, 2, ...), fill with 3s. For odd layers (1, 3, ...), create a path of 0s.\n\nIn Example 0 (6x6):\n\n- Layer 0 (even): filled with 3s.\n- Layer 1 (odd): has 0s in row 1, columns 0-4; row 4, columns 1-4.\n- Layer 2 (even): filled with 3s, but there's a path of 0s in row 2, column 4; row 3, column 1 and 4.\n\nHmm, this doesn't align perfectly. For example, layer 2 (rows 2-3, columns 2-3) would be filled with 3s if even. But in the output, row 2 has 3s up to column 3, then 0 and 3. So perhaps the layers are defined differently.\n\nAnother approach: each layer is a single row/column thick. For example, in 6x6:\n\nLayer 0: perimeter (row 0, column 0-5; row 5, column 0-5; columns 0 and 5, rows 1-4)\nLayer 1: row 1, columns 1-4; row 4, columns 1-4; columns 1 and 4, rows 2-3)\nLayer 2: row 2, columns 2-3; row 3, columns 2-3; columns 2 and 3, rows 2-3)\n\nBut in this case, each layer is two cells thick. For even layers, fill with 3s. For odd layers, create a path.\n\nAlternatively, the layers are defined such that each layer is a square that is offset by i steps from the edge. For each layer i, if i is even, fill with 3s; if i is odd, create a path of 0s.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think about the 6x6 example. The output's layers are:\n\n- Layer 0 (i=0): perimeter (all 3s)\n- Layer 1 (i=1): next square inward, which includes rows 1-4 and columns 1-4. In this layer, the top row (row 1) has 0s except last column, the bottom row (row 4) has 0s except first column, and the left and right columns (columns 1 and 4) have 0s in certain rows. But this doesn't quite fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the pattern is best understood as creating a spiral that starts from the top, moves right, then down, then left, then up, each time the path length decreases by one. The 0s form the path, and the 3s are the walls. The entrance to the spiral is from the top row, and each turn allows the spiral to move inward.\n\nTo implement this, the algorithm would:\n\n1. Fill the entire grid with 3s.\n2. Create a spiral path of 0s starting from the top row, moving right, then down, then left, then up, each time reducing the step count by one.\n\nHowever, looking at the examples, the 0s don't form a continuous path. For example, in the 6x6 output, row 1 has 0s in columns 0-4, which is a horizontal line of 0s. Then row 2 has a 0 in column 4. Row 3 has 0s in column 1 and 4. Row 4 has 0s in columns 1-4. So perhaps the path is:\n\n- Start at row 1, columns 0-4 (0s), then move down to row 4, column 4 (0 in row 4, column 4), then left to column 1 (row 4, columns 1-4 are 0s), then up to row 3, column 1 (0 in row 3, column 1), then right to column 3 (row 3, column 4 is 0), then down to row 2, column 4 (0 in row 2, column 4), etc. This forms a spiral path.\n\nBut how to generalize this for any grid size?\n\nThe key seems to be that for each layer, the path alternates between horizontal and vertical, and each time the length of the path decreases. For example:\n\n- For the first inward layer (after the perimeter), the path is horizontal (row 1, columns 0-4 for 6x6).\n- Next, the path is vertical (columns 4, rows 1-4).\n- Then horizontal again (row 4, columns 1-4).\n- Then vertical (column 1, rows 3-2).\n- Then horizontal (row 2, columns 2-3).\n- etc.\n\nBut the exact pattern may vary based on grid size.\n\nAlternatively, the number of layers is floor(N/2), and each layer i (starting from 0) is processed by creating a spiral path if i is odd.\n\nThis is getting too abstract. To solve the test input, which is an 18x18 grid of zeros, I need to generate an output similar to the training examples. Looking at the training examples, the pattern involves creating a spiral of 3s with 0s forming the inward path.\n\nFor the test input, which is 18x18, the output should have:\n\n- The first row all 3s.\n- The second row all 0s except the last element (3).\n- The third row 3s except the penultimate element (0) and last (3).\n- Subsequent rows follow a pattern where each layer inward adds a new turn in the spiral, with 0s appearing in specific positions to form the path.\n\nThe spiral will have multiple layers, each with alternating directions (right, down, left, up), and the path of 0s allows movement inward.\n\nTo construct this, perhaps the number of layers is 9 (since 18/2=9). Each layer alternates between 3s and 0s, creating a spiral.\n\nBut without a clear formula, this is challenging. However, based on the examples, the output for the test case should follow the same pattern. Let's try to outline the first few rows of the expected output:\n\nRow 0: all 3s.\nRow 1: 17 0s followed by 3.\nRow 2: 16 3s, then 0, 3.\nRow 3: 3, 16 0s, then 3, 0, 3. Wait, no. Looking at Example 4 (10x10), the pattern for row 2 is 8 3s, then 0, 3. So for 18x18, row 2 would have 16 3s, then 0, 3.\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n\nRow 3: 3, followed by 16 0s, then 3? No, looking at Example 4's row 3: [3, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0, 3, 0, 3], but this is for a 10x10 grid. The exact pattern depends on the layer.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 3s in each row after the first decreases by two each layer. For example:\n\nRow 0: 18 3s.\nRow 1: 17 0s and 1 3.\nRow 2: 16 3s, 0, 3.\nRow 3: 3, 15 0s, 3, 0, 3.\nRow 4: 3, 0, 14 3s, 0, 3.\n... and so on.\n\nBut this is a guess. Alternatively, each layer adds a new turn, and the number of 3s in each row corresponds to the current depth of the spiral.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to recognize that the output creates a spiral where each layer inward has a path of 0s that allows the spiral to continue. The pattern is such that for even-sized grids, the spiral has a certain number of layers, and each layer's 0s are placed in specific positions to form the path.\n\nBased on the examples, the test output for an 18x18 grid would have:\n\n- All 3s in the first and last rows.\n- The second row has all 0s except the last element.\n- The third row has 3s up to column 16, then 0 and 3.\n- The fourth row starts with 3, then 0s up to column 15, then 3, 0, 3.\n- And so on, forming a spiral that winds inward with each layer.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the final answer should be a grid where each row has 3s forming the spiral walls and 0s forming the path inward, alternating directions each layer.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out this pattern. So, all the input grids are filled with zeros, and the outputs have a bunch of 3s and some zeros. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0: it's a 6x6 grid. The output has 3s forming a border around the edges. The second row starts with zeros and ends with a 3. Then the third row has 3s except for the last two, which are 0 and 3. Hmm, maybe it's creating some kind of spiral or layered pattern? Let me check other examples.\n\nExample 1 is 8x8. The output has a border of 3s again. The second row ends with a 3, and then each subsequent row seems to have 3s forming a kind of square spiral inward. Like, the third row has a 3s except for the sixth and seventh positions, which are zeros leading into a smaller square. It looks like layers are being added, each time creating a new ring of 3s but leaving a path of zeros that winds inward.\n\nLooking at Example 2, which is 15x15. The output definitely has multiple layers. Each layer alternates between 3s and zeros, creating a sort of maze-like spiral. The zeros form a path that spirals inward, with each turn creating a new layer. The pattern seems to alternate between horizontal and vertical lines of 3s, leaving a single zero path that snakes towards the center.\n\nSo the general pattern seems to be creating a spiral pathway of zeros that starts from the top right, moves down, then left, then up, then right, each time making a smaller loop. Each loop is formed by 3s except for a single path of zeros that allows the spiral to go inward. The number of layers depends on the size of the grid. For even-sized grids, maybe the center is a small square, and for odd-sized, a single cell.\n\nLet me think about how the layers are structured. For each layer, the top row is all 3s except maybe the last element. Then the next row has zeros except the last element. Then a row of 3s but with some zeros leading into the next layer. It's a bit complex. Let's try to model this.\n\nLooking at the 6x6 example (even size). The output has the outermost layer as all 3s. The next layer starts at row 1, column 5 (0-based?), maybe. Wait, in the output of Example 0:\n\nRow 0: all 3s.\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,3] \u2192 the last element is 3, others 0.\nRow 2: [3,3,3,3,0,3] \u2192 starts with 3s except the fifth is 0.\nRow 3: [3,0,3,3,0,3] \u2192 starts with 3, then 0, then 3s except fifth 0.\nRow 4: [3,0,0,0,0,3] \u2192 starts with 3, then all 0s except last.\nRow 5: all 3s again.\n\nThis seems to form a spiral. Starting from the top right, moving down, then left, then up, then right, each time shrinking the spiral. The zeros form the path. For each layer, the path alternates direction. Maybe the algorithm is to create layers where each layer's path is a single cell thick, and alternates directions, with 3s forming the walls around the path.\n\nAnother observation: the output for even-sized grids (like 6x6, 8x8, 10x10) has a certain number of layers. For example, 6x6 has 3 layers (outermost 3s, then two inner layers). 8x8 would have more layers. The test input is 18x18, so maybe the spiral will have multiple layers, each time adding a new ring.\n\nLet me try to figure out how the direction changes. The path of zeros seems to start at the end of the first row (like position (0, n-1)), then go down along the rightmost column, then left along the bottom row, then up along the leftmost column, then right again, but each time moving inward by one step.\n\nWait, in Example 0 (6x6), the zeros start at row 1, column 5 (assuming 0-based index). Then in row 2, the 0 is at column 4. Then in row 3, column 4 is 0 again, but also column 1. Hmm, maybe I need to see the path step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each ring alternates between horizontal and vertical 3s with a single 0 path. For example, the outermost ring is all 3s except for the last element of the first row. Then the next ring has 3s except for a path going down, then left, then up, etc.\n\nAlternatively, it's creating concentric squares. The outermost square is all 3s. Then inside, another square, but with a gap (zeros) that allows a spiral path. Each inner square has a gap in a different position.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a series of concentric rectangles made of 3s, with a single zero path that snakes inward. Each rectangle is two rows and columns smaller than the previous. The path alternates between horizontal and vertical directions. For example, the first layer (outer) is all 3s. Then next layer starts with a row of zeros except the last element. Then a column of 3s except the last element. Then a row, etc.\n\nWait, in Example 1 (8x8):\n\nThe first row is all 3s.\n\nRow 1: all zeros except last element 3.\n\nRow 2: 3s except the sixth and seventh elements (0, 3).\n\nRow 3: starts with 3, then zeros, then 3, then 0, 3.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that for each layer, the path moves in a clockwise spiral, creating a new 'notch' each time. The length of the path decreases as you go inward.\n\nAnother approach: For each layer, starting from the top right, the path moves down, then left, then up, then right, but each time the length of the path decreases by two (since the grid is getting smaller by two in each dimension). The 3s form the walls around this path.\n\nBut how is this implemented in the output matrices?\n\nLooking at Example 0 (6x6):\n\nThe spiral starts at (0,5) (row 0, column 5). Then moves down to (5,5). Then left to (5,0), then up to (1,0), then right to (1,4), forming a spiral. But the output doesn't have zeros along this entire path. Wait, the output's zeros are in specific positions.\n\nWait, the output of Example 0:\n\nRow 1 has zeros in columns 0-4, 3 at 5.\n\nRow 2 has 3s except column 4 is 0.\n\nRow 3 has 3s except column 1 and 4 are 0.\n\nRow 4 has 3s except columns 1-4 are 0.\n\nSo maybe the path is a single cell that zigzags inward. For example, in row 1, the zeros are leading to the next layer. Then in row 2, the 0 is at column 4, which is the start of the next layer's path. Then row 3 has a 0 at column 1, creating a left turn.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each layer is a square ring, and the path alternates between horizontal and vertical. For even layers (starting from 0), the path is horizontal, then vertical, etc. Each layer is created by turning right each time.\n\nBut how to map this into the matrix indices?\n\nAlternatively, the 3s form a kind of maze where each layer has a single opening that allows a spiral path. The openings are placed in a way that each new layer's opening is shifted clockwise.\n\nLooking at the 6x6 example:\n\nThe first layer (outermost) is all 3s except the last element of the first row (0-based row 0, column 5) is 3. Wait, no, the first row is all 3s. Wait, maybe the first row is all 3s, then the second row has all zeros except the last element. Then the third row has 3s except the fifth element (column 4) is 0, and so on. So the path starts in the second row, moves left, then down, then left again, etc.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the output is generated by creating a spiral that starts from the top right and moves inward, with each turn creating a new layer of 3s except for a single path of zeros. The number of layers depends on the size of the grid. For a grid of size N, there would be floor(N/2) layers.\n\nLet me check the examples:\n\nExample 0 is 6x6. The output shows 3 layers (the outermost 3s, then two inner layers). 6/2 =3, which matches.\n\nExample 1 is 8x8. The output has 4 layers. 8/2=4.\n\nExample 2 is 15x15. 15/2 is 7.5, but the layers seem to be 7 (since it's odd, maybe one more layer in the middle).\n\nSo the pattern could be that each layer is a square ring, and each layer has a single zero path that allows the spiral to turn inward.\n\nNow, the test input is 18x18. So layers would be 9. Each layer alternates the direction of the zero path.\n\nBut how to construct the output matrix?\n\nLet's think of how each layer is built.\n\nLayer 0 (outermost): All 3s except for the last element of the first row (maybe). Then the next layer starts with a row of zeros except the last element, then a column of 3s except the last element, then a row of 3s except a zero in the next position, etc.\n\nAlternatively, each layer starts with a row of 3s, then a row of zeros leading into the next layer, then 3s again except for a single zero path.\n\nWait, looking at the 6x6 example:\n\nRow 0: all 3s.\n\nRow 1: all 0s except last element 3. This could be the entry point to the next layer.\n\nRow 2: 3s except the fourth element (index 4) is 0. Then row 3 has 3s except index 1 and 4 are 0. Row 4 has 0s except first and last elements. Then row 5 is all 3s.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a pattern in how the zeros are placed in each row.\n\nAnother approach: For each layer, the path of zeros alternates between horizontal and vertical. The first layer (outermost) has a horizontal path (row 1, columns 0-4) leading into the next layer. Then the next layer has a vertical path (column 4, rows 2-4), then a horizontal path (row 4, columns 0-3), etc. Each time, the path length decreases.\n\nWait, in Example 0:\n\nRow 1: 0s from column 0 to 4 (horizontal path).\n\nRow 2: 3s except column 4 is 0 (vertical path starts at row 2, column 4).\n\nRow 3: 3s except column 1 and 4 are 0. Maybe this is part of the vertical path and then a horizontal path?\n\nAlternatively, the path is a spiral that moves inward, and each turn reduces the length of the path by one.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each layer, the direction of the zero path alternates between horizontal and vertical, and each layer's path is offset by one step.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's look for a pattern in the layers.\n\nIn Example 0 (6x6):\n\nLayer 0: outer border (all 3s).\n\nLayer 1: starts at row 1. The path is horizontal (all zeros except last column) leading to row 1, column 5. Then the path turns down along column 5, but in row 2, column 4 is 0. Then the path turns left along row 2, columns 4 to 0? But row 2 has 3s except column 4 is 0. Then row 3 has 0 at column 1 and 4.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of the position of the zeros in each row and column.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output (8x8):\n\nRow 0: all 3s.\n\nRow 1: zeros except last element.\n\nRow 2: 3s except columns 6 and 7 (0 and 3).\n\nWait, no: Row 2 is [3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3]. So columns 0-5 are 3, column 6 is 0, 7 is 3.\n\nRow 3: [3,0,0,0,0,3,0,3]. Columns 0 is 3, then 0s up to column 4, then 3, 0, 3.\n\nRow 4: [3,0,3,3,0,3,0,3]. So column 0 is 3, 0 at column1, 3s, 0 at column4, etc.\n\nRow 5: [3,0,3,3,3,3,0,3]. Column 0 is 3, 0 at column1, 3s, 0 at column6.\n\nRow 6: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. Column 0 is 3, then zeros up to column6.\n\nRow7: all 3s.\n\nHmm. It looks like each layer has a horizontal path (row with zeros) followed by a vertical path (column with a single zero), then another horizontal path, and so on. The positions of the zeros alternate between the right and left sides as you go inward.\n\nAnother pattern: Each layer starts with a row of zeros (except the last element), then a column of 3s with a single zero, then a row of 3s with a single zero, then a column of zeros (except the first element?), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, the spiral is created by making a loop around the grid, each time moving inward and leaving a single zero in the corner. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: all 3s (border).\n\nRow 1: all 0s except last 3. This is the first step inward.\n\nRow 2: 3s except the fifth element (index4) is 0. So here, the path turns left.\n\nRow3: 3s except index1 and 4 are 0. So maybe the path goes left to index1.\n\nRow4: 0s except first and last. So the path is moving up.\n\nRow5: all 3s again.\n\nThis seems like a spiral that starts by moving down the rightmost column, then left along the bottom, then up the leftmost column, then right again. But the zeros are placed to create this path.\n\nBut how is this pattern applied to different grid sizes?\n\nLooking at Example 2 (15x15), which is larger, the layers are more numerous. The spiral path winds inward multiple times, each time creating a new layer of 3s with a single zero path.\n\nSo, the general approach would be:\n\n1. The outermost layer is all 3s.\n\n2. For each subsequent layer (moving inward), create a path of zeros that allows the spiral to turn inward.\n\n3. The path alternates direction each layer (horizontal, vertical, etc.), with the position of the zeros shifting inward each time.\n\nThe exact placement of the zeros would depend on the current layer's depth. For each layer, the starting position of the zero path is determined by the current depth.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input, which is 18x18. This is even, so the number of layers is 9.\n\nFollowing the pattern from the examples:\n\n- The first row (row 0) is all 3s.\n\n- Row 1 has all zeros except the last element (3).\n\n- Row 2 has 3s except the element before last (index 16) is 0.\n\nThen row 3 has 3s except the second element (index1) and the element at index16 is 0.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a systematic way to generate each layer.\n\nAlternatively, each layer has two rows and two columns. For example, the first layer (outermost) is rows 0 and n-1, columns 0 and n-1. The next layer is rows 1 and n-2, columns 1 and n-2, and so on.\n\nFor each layer i (starting from 0), the current square is from row i to row n-1-i, and column i to column n-1-i.\n\nWithin this layer, the path is created by placing zeros in specific positions to allow the spiral.\n\nFor example, in layer 0 (outermost):\n\n- All cells are 3s except possibly the first row's end.\n\nBut in example 0, layer 0 (rows 0-5, columns 0-5) has row 0 as all 3s, rows 1-4 have their own patterns, and row5 all 3s.\n\nHmm, maybe the layers are constructed in a way that each layer's top row (except the first) starts with a row of zeros (except last element), then a vertical path down, then a row of 3s with a zero, etc.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for a mathematical pattern in the positions of the zeros.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nZeros are in:\n\nRow1: columns 0-4 (all zeros).\n\nRow2: column4.\n\nRow3: columns1 and4.\n\nRow4: columns1-4.\n\nSo the pattern here is that for each row in the layer, the zeros are placed in a certain range. For example, row1 has all zeros except last element. Then row2 has a single zero at column4. Then row3 has two zeros: one at column1 (start of the next layer's path) and column4. Row4 has zeros from column1 to4, creating a horizontal path.\n\nThis seems like a clockwise spiral. Starting from row1, moving left, then down, then left, then up, etc.\n\nAlternatively, think of the spiral as follows:\n\nStarting from the top-right corner (row0, column5 in 6x6), the path moves down along the rightmost column (column5) but since row0 is all 3s, the path starts at row1. Row1 has zeros leading to column5. Then in row2, the path turns left into column4, then down to row3, column4. Then left to column1, then up to row4, column1, then right to column4 again.\n\nWait, this might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the spiral path is created by alternating between horizontal and vertical segments. Each segment has a length that decreases by one each time.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Horizontal right to left: row1, columns0-4 (length5).\n\n- Vertical down to row4, column4 (length3).\n\n- Horizontal left to right: row4, columns1-4 (length4).\n\nBut this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the number of zeros in each row or column follows a certain pattern. For example, in row1 of Example0, there are5 zeros. Then row2 has1 zero. Row3 has2 zeros. Row4 has4 zeros. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: The output matrices have a border of 3s. The first inner layer is a horizontal line of zeros except the last element. The next layer is a vertical line of zeros, then a horizontal line, and so on. Each time, the position of the zeros shifts inward by one step.\n\nFor even-sized grids, the center would have a 2x2 area. For odd-sized, a single cell.\n\nThe test input is 18x18, which is even. So the center is 2x2. The pattern would have 9 layers.\n\nEach layer adds a new ring of 3s with a single zero path leading inward.\n\nSo, the first layer (outermost) is all 3s.\n\nLayer 1 (inside) has row1 as zeros except last element. Then layer2 has column16 (since 18-1-1=16) with zeros from row2 to row16. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, each layer i has:\n\n- Top row (i) is all 3s except possibly the last element.\n\n- Next row (i+1) is zeros except last element.\n\n- Then a vertical line of 3s with a zero at a certain position.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to model one layer and see if I can replicate the pattern.\n\nTake Example0's output. The first layer is all 3s. Then layer1 (row1) is zeros except last element. Then layer2 starts with row2, which has 3s except column4 is zero. Then layer3 is row3, which has 3s except column1 and4. And so on.\n\nThe pattern seems to be that each layer's starting row has a horizontal line of zeros except the last element, then the next row has a single zero in the same column as the previous row's last zero minus one. Then the next row has a zero in the next column to the left, and so on.\n\nBut this is not clear. Another approach: For each even layer (starting from 0), the path is horizontal, and for odd layers, vertical. The length of the path decreases by two each layer.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each layer, the path alternates between a horizontal line (all zeros except the last element) and a vertical line (single zero in a column). Each layer's path is shorter by two each time.\n\nFor example, in 6x6:\n\nLayer1 (row1): horizontal path of 5 zeros (columns0-4), leading to column5.\n\nLayer2 (row2): vertical path from row2 to row4, column4 has zeros.\n\nLayer3 (row3): horizontal path from column1 to column4 in row3.\n\nWait, but in example0's row3, there are two zeros: column1 and4.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: The pattern forms a spiral where each corner is a 3, and the path of zeros is along the edges between corners. Each turn in the spiral is marked by a single zero.\n\nFor example, in Example0:\n\nThe spiral starts at row1, column0. Moves right to column4 (all zeros), then down to row4, column4 (0 in row2, column4), then left to column1 (0 in row3, column1), then up to row4 (0s in row4, columns1-4), then right again.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe the key is to observe that in each layer, the first row after the top border has all zeros except the last element. Then the next row has 3s except the second to last column. Then the following row has 3s except the second column, and so on, alternating between rows and columns and moving inward.\n\nAlternatively, each layer consists of two steps: a horizontal and a vertical segment. The horizontal segment is a row of zeros except the last element, leading to a vertical segment (a column of 3s with a single zero) to turn inward.\n\nFor example, in Example0:\n\n- Layer1: row1 is zeros except last element. Then, in column5, from row2 to row4, the zeros are placed at row2, column4. Wait, but in row2, the zero is at column4, which is adjacent to the previous zero.\n\nThen, in row3, column1 is zero. Then row4 has zeros from column1 to4.\n\nThis seems to form a path that snakes inward.\n\nAlternatively, the number of layers is N/2, and for each layer i (starting from 0), the zeros are placed in positions that are i steps away from the edges.\n\nFor example, in layer i:\n\n- The top row of the layer is row i.\n\n- The path starts at column (n-1 - i) and moves down i steps, then left (n-1 - 2i) steps, then up (n-1 - 2i) steps, then right (n-1 - 2i -1) steps, and so on.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Let's think of the layers as concentric squares. Each square has a width of (n - 2i) for layer i.\n\nFor each layer, the square is formed by 3s, except for a single opening that allows the spiral to turn inward. The opening's position alternates between the top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left, and top-left as we go deeper.\n\nBut how does this lead to the specific patterns in the examples?\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the layers as follows. For each layer i (starting from 0):\n\n- The top row of the layer (row i) is all 3s except the last element, which is 3 (so no opening here).\n\nWait, example0's first layer (row0) is all 3s. Then row1 has all zeros except last element 3. So maybe the opening is in row1, columns0-4 (the zeros), leading to the next layer.\n\nThe next layer (i=1) starts at row1, column5. Then the path moves down to row2, column4 (the zero in row2, column4). Then left to row3, column1 (zero), then up to row4, column0-4 (zeros), and then the next layer starts.\n\nBut I'm not seeing the exact pattern. Maybe it's better to think in terms of how the zeros form a spiral that alternately moves right, down, left, up, etc., with each segment length decreasing by one each time.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\nThe spiral path is:\n\nStart at row1, column0.\n\nMove right to column4 (5 zeros in row1).\n\nMove down to row4, column4 (zeros in row2,3,4 at column4).\n\nMove left to column1 (zeros in row4, columns1-4).\n\nMove up to row2 (zeros in row3 and row4's columns1).\n\nThen perhaps right again, but there's no more zeros.\n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the spiral starts at row1, column5 (the last element of row1 is 3, but the previous elements are zeros. So the path is row1, columns0-4, which leads to row1, column5 (3). Then the path moves down to row2, column5 (3), but in row2, column4 is 0. So the path turns left to column4, then down to row4, column4. Then left to column0, etc.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to recognize that the output forms a spiral maze where each layer is a square of 3s with a single path of zeros that snakes inward. The pattern alternates between horizontal and vertical paths, and the zeros are placed such that each turn leads into the next layer.\n\nFor the test input (18x18), the output would have 9 layers. Each layer would have a similar pattern to the examples but scaled up. The outermost layer is all 3s. Then each subsequent layer adds a spiral turn with zeros in the appropriate positions.\n\nSo the test output would look like:\n\nFirst row: all 3s.\n\nSecond row: all zeros except last element 3.\n\nThird row: 3s except the 17th column (index 16) is 0.\n\nFourth row: 3s except the 17th column is 3 and the 1st column is 0.\n\nAnd so on, creating a spiral that winds inward with each layer, alternating between horizontal and vertical paths of zeros, surrounded by 3s.\n\nThe final output for the test case would follow this pattern, with each layer's zeros placed to continue the spiral inward, and the 3s forming the walls around the path.",
