        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So we have these input grids of 8x8 numbers and outputs that are 4x4 grids. The challenge is to find how the input is transformed into the output. Let's look at the training examples to spot any patterns.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has 8 rows each with 8 elements. The output is 4 rows each with 4 elements. Let's see if the output is derived by combining the input rows in some way. For instance, maybe each pair of input rows is merged into one output row. Let's check the first two input rows of Example 0:\n\nInput rows 0 and 1 are [4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0] and [4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The first output row is [4,4,5,0]. Hmm, maybe taking the non-zero elements from each pair. Let's see: the first input row has 4,4,5, and the second has 4,4. But the output is [4,4,5,0]. Wait, combining the non-zero elements from two rows? The first row's non-zero are 4,4,5. Second row has 4,4. But the output has four elements. Maybe the first two elements are from the first row, the next two from the second. Or perhaps combining two rows into one by taking non-zero values in order, but filling up to four elements. Let me see.\n\nIn Example 0's first output row [4,4,5,0], perhaps the first two elements are the non-zero from the first input row (4,4,5). Then the next two from the second input row (4,4, but maybe only 4,4). But the output has 4,4,5,0. Hmm, the 5 is from the first row's 5, and then 0? Maybe it's taking the first non-zero elements from each pair of rows, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is divided into 2x2 blocks and then each block contributes to the output. For example, each 2x2 block in the input becomes a single element in the output. But the output is 4x4, so 16 elements, but the input is 8x8 (64 elements). So 64 divided by 4 would be 16 per output element, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, each 2 rows and 2 columns are combined into one element. Let's check.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is formed by taking certain elements from the input. For instance, looking at Example 0's input, the first output row is [4,4,5,0]. Let's look at the first two input rows:\n\nRow 0: [4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0]\nRow 1: [4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nIf we take the first two elements from row 0 (4,4), then the fifth and sixth elements (0,0) but maybe that's not it. Alternatively, the non-zero elements from rows 0 and 1. Row 0 has 4,4,5; row 1 has 4,4. So combined, maybe [4,4,5,4,4], but the output row is length 4. So perhaps taking the first four non-zero elements from the combined rows. But in row 0 and 1, combined non-zero would be 4,4,5,4,4. The output is [4,4,5,0]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Or maybe the sum of non-zero in each column. Wait, maybe each column pair is being processed. For example, columns 0 and 1 of the input could form the first output element, columns 2 and 3 the second, etc. But 8 columns would become 4, and 8 rows would become 4. So each 2x2 block in the input becomes a single value. Let's check that.\n\nTake the first 2 rows and first 2 columns of input Example 0:\n\nRow0: 4,4\nRow1:4,4\n\nSo combining these four elements (4,4,4,4), maybe sum them or take the maximum. If sum, 4+4+4+4=16, but the output is 4. So maybe the maximum is taken. The maximum here is 4, which matches the first element of output. Then next two columns (columns 2-3) in rows 0-1: 0,0 and 0,0. The max would be 0. But the output's next element is 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe not a max.\n\nAlternative idea: For each 2x2 block in the input, sum the non-zero values. Let's see. For the first 2x2 block (columns 0-1, rows 0-1):\n\n4,4\n\n4,4\n\nSum of non-zero is 4+4+4+4=16. But output is 4. So maybe count the number of non-zero in the block. Here, 4, which would match the output 4. Next block (columns 2-3, rows 0-1):\n\n0,0\n\n0,0 \u2192 0 non-zero. Output second element is 4. Wait that doesn't fit. So perhaps not that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of non-zero elements from each pair of rows, but in a specific order. Let's take Example 0's first two input rows again:\n\nRow0: 4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0\n\nRow1:4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nIf we look for non-zero in these two rows, perhaps taking from the first row first, then the second. So the non-zero elements in row0 are 4,4,5. Row1's non-zero are 4,4. Combined, that's 4,4,5,4,4. But the output is [4,4,5,0]. So maybe take the first four non-zero elements from the two rows combined. Wait, but that would be 4,4,5,4. The output's first row is [4,4,5,0]. Hmm, but the fourth element is 0. So maybe if there are less than four non-zero elements in the combined pair, fill with zeros. Wait in this case, combining the two rows gives 4,4,5,4,4 (five elements). But the output is four. So maybe take the first four non-zero? Then 4,4,5,4. But the output is [4,4,5,0]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two elements of each row. For row0, first two elements are 4,4. Row1's first two are 4,4. Then output row would be [4,4,4,4], but actual output is [4,4,5,0]. So that's not it.\n\nLooking at the third element in the output row (5) comes from row0's 6th element (5). So perhaps taking elements from positions 0,1,6,7 of each pair of rows. Let's check:\n\nRow0: 4 (0), 4 (1), 5 (6), 0 (7) \u2192 4,4,5,0 \u2192 matches the output's first row. Row1's 0,1,6,7 would be 4,4,0,0. But the output's first row is from row0 and row1? Or maybe each pair of rows (row0 and row1) is combined into one output row. For row0 and row1, take elements 0,1 from row0, then elements 6,7 from row1. Wait row0's 0,1 are 4,4. Row1's 6,7 are 0,0. So that would give [4,4,0,0], but the output is [4,4,5,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, take elements from positions 0,1 from row0, and 6,7 from row0. Because row0's 0,1,6,7 are 4,4,5,0. Which matches the first output row. Then row1's elements would contribute to the next output row? Let's check. The second output row in Example0 is [6,6,6,9]. Let's see which rows from input are considered. The input rows 2 and 3:\n\nRow2: [0,0,4,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow3: [0,4,0,0,5,5,0,0]\n\nIf we take elements 0,1 from row2: 0,0. Then elements 6,7 from row2:5,0. Combining gives [0,0,5,0]. But the output's second row is [6,6,6,9]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pairs of rows are rows 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7. Each pair is combined into a single output row. For the first pair (rows0 and 1), the output row is [4,4,5,0]. Let's see how that's formed. Maybe concatenate non-zero elements from both rows. Row0 has 4,4,5. Row1 has 4,4. So combined, 4,4,5,4,4. But the output is 4 elements. So perhaps take the first four non-zero elements. 4,4,5,4 \u2192 but the output is [4,4,5,0]. Wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe there's a different rule.\n\nLooking at the output elements for the first row in Example0: [4,4,5,0]. The input rows 0 and 1 have 4s in the first two columns. Then in row0, there's a 5 in the 6th position, and row1 has nothing. So maybe the output row is made by taking the first two elements from row0 (4,4), then the sixth and seventh elements from row0 (5,0). But why 5,0? Let's check: row0's sixth element is 5, seventh is 0. So combining the first two and the last two elements of row0. Then, the same for other pairs. But then row1 would not contribute. But maybe each output row is formed from a single input row. But the output has four rows, and the input has eight. So perhaps two input rows form one output row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is formed by taking elements from two consecutive input rows, but selecting specific positions. For example, in the first output row, elements from positions 0,1 of row0, and positions 6,7 of row0. That would give 4,4,5,0. Then the next output row could be from row2's elements 0,1 (0,0) and 6,7 (5,0). But the second output row in example0 is [6,6,6,9], which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are formed by looking at certain quadrants of the input. For example, the input is divided into four quadrants (each 4x4), and each quadrant is processed into a row. But in Example0, the output is four rows, each four elements. So maybe each quadrant's non-zero elements are collected into the output row. For instance, the top-left 4x4 quadrant (rows 0-3, columns 0-3) of input. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, input rows 0-3, columns 0-3:\n\nRow0:4,4,0,0\n\nRow1:4,4,0,0\n\nRow2:0,0,4,0\n\nRow3:0,4,0,0\n\nThe non-zero elements here are 4,4,4,4,4. How to get the output's first row [4,4,5,0] from this? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of non-zero elements from the first four rows and the next four rows. For example, first four rows (maybe some 4s and 5s) and next four rows (6s and 9s). In example0's output, the first two rows are [4,4,5,0] and [6,6,6,9]. The third row is [6,9,5,6], which mixes 6,9,5. Hmm, this seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output:\n\nRow0:4,4,5,0\n\nRow1:6,6,6,9\n\nRow2:6,9,5,6\n\nRow3:5,5,6,0\n\nThese elements are a mix of 4,5,6,9. The input's first four rows have 4s and 5s, the next four rows have 6s and 9s. So maybe each output row combines elements from both the top and bottom halves. For example, output row 0: maybe takes two elements from the top half (4,4) and two from the bottom half (5,0). But where would 5 come from? The input's fifth row is [6,6,6,0,0,0,0,9], which has 6s and a 9. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from each pair of rows (e.g., row 0 and row 4, row 1 and row 5, etc.) But in example0, the output has four rows. Let's see. If rows are paired as 0-4, 1-5, 2-6, 3-7. For example0:\n\nRow0 and row4:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,6,0,0,0,9,0]\n\nCombined non-zero elements: 4,4,5,6,9. Output row0 is [4,4,5,0]. So maybe take the first three non-zero and pad with zero. But in this case, 4,4,5,6 would be first four, but output is 4,4,5,0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by combining the non-zero elements from the first four rows and the next four rows. For example, the first output row could be non-zero elements from rows 0-3, columns 0-3, then rows 4-7, columns 4-7. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at another example. Example1's input has rows with 4s,5s and 6s,9s. The output rows are a mix. For example, the first output row is [5,5,0,6]. Let's see where 5 and 6 come from. Looking at the input rows:\n\nPerhaps the output is formed by taking non-zero elements from the input in some diagonal or cross pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell corresponds to a specific position in the input grid. For example, output cell (0,0) is the first non-zero in row0, then cell (0,1) is first non-zero in row1, etc. But given that there are 8 input rows and 4 output rows, perhaps two input rows contribute to one output row.\n\nWait, each output row has four elements, and there are four output rows. So maybe each output row is made by combining two input rows. Let's take Example0's output first row [4,4,5,0]. The first two input rows are:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow1: [4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nIf I take the first two elements of row0 (4,4), then the last two elements of row0 (5,0), that gives [4,4,5,0], which matches the first output row. Then for the next output row [6,6,6,9], the next two input rows are rows 2 and 3:\n\nRow2: [0,0,4,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow3: [0,4,0,0,5,5,0,0]\n\nIf we take row2's first two elements (0,0) and row3's last two (0,0). That doesn't match. So maybe take the first two elements of row2 (0,0) and the last two of row3 (0,0), but output is [6,6,6,9]. Doesn't fit. So that approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking the first two and last two elements of each pair of input rows. For example, rows 0 and 1 in Example0's input: take first two from row0 (4,4), then first two from row1 (4,4). So combined as [4,4,4,4], but the output is [4,4,5,0]. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: maybe each output row is formed by taking elements from two input rows, but in a specific order. For example, first element from row0, column0; second from row1, column0; third from row0, column6; fourth from row1, column6. Let's check:\n\nRow0:4 (col0), row1:4 (col0). Then row0's col6:5, row1's col6:0. So 4,4,5,0. Which matches the first output row. Then the next output row would be row2 and row3. Row2 col0:0, row3 col0:0. Then row2 col6:5, row3 col6:0. Which would give [0,0,5,0], but the second output row is [6,6,6,9]. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in Example0's input, rows 4-7 are:\n\nRow4: [0,0,6,0,0,0,9,0]\n\nRow5: [6,6,6,0,0,0,0,9]\n\nRow6: [6,0,6,6,9,9,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,6,6,0,9,0,0,0]\n\nThe second output row is [6,6,6,9]. Let's see, row5's first three elements are 6,6,6. And the last element is 9 from row5's last element. So maybe taking row5's first three elements and last element: 6,6,6,9. Which matches the output row. Then the third output row is [6,9,5,6]. Where do these come from? Looking at rows 6 and 7. Row6 has 6,0,6,6,9,9,0,0. Row7 has 0,6,6,0,9,0,0,0. Maybe taking elements from row6 and row7. For example, row6's first element 6, row7's second element 6, row6's fifth element 9, row7's fifth element 9. But the output row is [6,9,5,6]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking non-zero elements from the input rows in a certain order. For example, the first output row takes non-zero from row0 and row1. Let's see: row0 has 4,4,5. Row1 has 4,4. Combining them, but how to get [4,4,5,0]. Maybe take the first four non-zero from the two rows combined. So 4 (row0),4 (row0),5 (row0),4 (row1). But that would be [4,4,5,4], but the output is [4,4,5,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, take the non-zero elements from the two rows in order, but if there's a zero in between, it's filled. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions of the numbers in the input and output. For example, in Example0's output row0: 4,4,5,0. The 4s are in the first two positions. Looking back at input rows 0 and 1, the first two elements are 4,4 in both rows. The 5 is from row0's 6th element, and the 0 is row1's 6th element. So maybe for each pair of rows, take elements 0 and 1 from the first row, and elements 6 and 7 from the second row. Let's check:\n\nRow0: elements 0,1 are 4,4.\n\nRow1: elements 6,7 are 0,0. So combining gives [4,4,0,0]. But the output is [4,4,5,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, take elements 0,1 from row0, and elements 6,7 from row0. Which gives [4,4,5,0]. That matches. Then for the next output row, take elements 0,1 from row2 and elements 6,7 from row2. Row2's 0,1 are 0,0. 6,7 are 5,0. So output would be [0,0,5,0]. But the actual second output row is [6,6,6,9]. So that approach only works for the first output row.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is different. Let's look at another example. Take Example1's input and output.\n\nExample1's first output row is [5,5,0,6]. Let's look at the first two input rows:\n\nRow0: [4,0,0,4,5,5,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5]\n\nIf we take elements 0,1 from row0 (4,0), and elements 6,7 from row0 (0,0). That would give [4,0,0,0], which doesn't match the output [5,5,0,6]. Alternatively, take elements from the end of the rows. Row0 has 5,5 in positions 4 and 5. Row1 has 5,5 in positions 6 and 7. Maybe combining these. So 5 (row0, pos4), 5 (row0, pos5), 5 (row1, pos6),5 (row1, pos7). But the output row is [5,5,0,6]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking certain diagonals from the input. For example, the main diagonal of the input matrix. But the input is 8x8 and output is 4x4. Taking every other element? Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the output structure across examples, the numbers seem to be a mix of the two different groups in the input. For example, in Example0's input, the first four rows have 4s and 5s, and the last four have 6s and 9s. The output includes both 4,5,6,9. So maybe each output row combines elements from both groups.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is formed by taking the sum of each 2x2 block in the input. Let's try this with Example0's input.\n\nTake the first 2x2 block (rows 0-1, columns 0-1):\n\n4,4\n\n4,4 \u2192 sum is 16. But output first element is 4. So maybe average. 16/4=4. That matches. Next block (rows0-1, columns2-3):\n\n0,0\n\n0,0 \u2192 sum 0 \u2192 output 4? No. Next block (columns4-5, rows0-1):\n\n0,0\n\n0,0 \u2192 sum 0. Output's second element is 4. Doesn't fit. So maybe not sum.\n\nAlternatively, the count of non-zero elements in each 2x2 block. For the first block (4,4,4,4), four non-zero \u2192 output 4. That matches the first element. Next block (0,0,0,0) \u2192 0, but output is 4. Doesn't fit. So no.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the output elements and see where they appear in the input. For Example0's output:\n\nFirst row:4,4,5,0. These numbers come from the first two input rows. The 4s are in the first two columns of row0 and row1. The 5 is from row0's sixth column. The 0 is from row1's seventh column.\n\nSecond row:6,6,6,9. These are from the fifth and sixth input rows. The first three 6s are from row5's first three columns, and the 9 is from row5's last column.\n\nThird row:6,9,5,6. The 6 could be from row6's first column, 9 from row6's fifth column, 5 from row2's sixth column, and 6 from row7's second column.\n\nFourth row:5,5,6,0. The 5s might be from row3's fifth and sixth columns, 6 from row7's second column, and 0 from somewhere.\n\nThis seems a bit scattered, but perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from specific positions in the input, but varying per row. For example, first output row takes elements from the first two rows' beginning and end, second row takes from next two rows' beginning and end, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the input in a spiral pattern or some other order. For example, starting from the top-left and moving clockwise, but this seems too vague.\n\nAnother angle: Let's check if the output for each example has the same number of non-zero elements as the input. For Example0's input, there are multiple 4s, 0s, 5s, 6s, and 9s. The output has 4,4,5,6,9,5,6, etc. It seems like the output is combining the non-zero elements from the input, but in a certain order and possibly truncating or padding to four elements per row.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe each output row corresponds to a diagonal in the input. For example, the main diagonal of the input is 8 elements, but the output rows are 4 elements. So perhaps taking every other element of the diagonal. But Example0's input main diagonal would be 4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0. Which doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by reading the input in a specific pattern, such as left to right, top to bottom, but only taking non-zero elements and arranging them into 4x4. For example, take all non-zero elements from the input, in order, and fill them into the output row-wise. But in Example0's input, non-zero elements are:\n\nRow0:4,4,5\n\nRow1:4,4\n\nRow2:4,5\n\nRow3:4,5,5\n\nRow4:6,9\n\nRow5:6,6,6,9\n\nRow6:6,6,6,9,9\n\nRow7:6,6,9\n\nTotal non-zero elements: 3+2+2+3+2+4+5+3=24. The output is 4x4=16 elements. So perhaps taking the first 16 non-zero elements. Let's list them:\n\n4,4,5 (row0)\n\n4,4 (row1)\n\n4,5 (row2)\n\n4,5,5 (row3)\n\n6,9 (row4)\n\n6,6,6,9 (row5)\n\n6,6,6,9,9 (row6)\n\n6,6,9 (row7)\n\nOrder: 4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,5,5,6,9,6,6,6,9,6,6,6,9,9,6,6,9. The first 16 elements would be:\n\n4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,5,5,6,9,6,6,6,9. But the output of Example0 is:\n\nRow0:4,4,5,0\n\nRow1:6,6,6,9\n\nRow2:6,9,5,6\n\nRow3:5,5,6,0\n\nThis doesn't match the order. So this approach may not work.\n\nPerhaps there's a different pattern. Let's look at the output of Example0:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[4,4,5,0]\n\n[6,6,6,9]\n\n[6,9,5,6]\n\n[5,5,6,0]\n\nThe numbers here seem to be arranged in a way that combines elements from different parts of the input. For instance, the first output row has 4s and a 5, which are from the top part of the input. The second row has 6s and a 9 from the bottom part. The third row has 6,9,5,6 which mixes elements from both. The fourth row has 5s and a 6, again mixing.\n\nThis suggests that each output row is a combination of elements from different sections of the input. Maybe each output row is formed by taking elements from two different rows: one from the top half and one from the bottom half. For example, row0 of output takes elements from input row0 and row4. Let's check Example0's row0 and row4:\n\nRow0:4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0\n\nRow4:0,0,6,0,0,0,9,0\n\nOutput row0:4,4,5,0. The 4,4 are from row0's first two elements. 5 is from row0's sixth element, and 0 could be from row4's seventh element. But why?\n\nAlternatively, take the first two elements from row0, then the sixth and seventh from row4. Row0's first two are 4,4. Row4's sixth and seventh are 0,0. So output would be [4,4,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, take non-zero elements from row0 and row4. Row0 has 4,4,5. Row4 has 6,9. Combining gives 4,4,5,6,9. Output row is [4,4,5,0]. So maybe only take the first three non-zero and add a zero. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the output is a transformation where each output cell is the sum of the corresponding input cell and the cell diagonally opposite. For example, output cell (i,j) = input cell (i*2, j*2) + input cell (i*2+1, j*2+1). Let's test this for Example0's first output cell (0,0):\n\nInput row0, column0 is 4. input row1, column1 is4. Sum 8. Output is 4. So not sum. Maybe average. 8/2=4. That matches. Next output cell (0,1):\n\ninput row0, column2=0. input row1, column3=0. Sum 0. Output is4. Doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, output cell (i,j) is input cell (i*2, j*2). For example0's (0,0):4. (0,1): row0, column2=0. Output is4. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's try to find another approach. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain elements from the input, such as the first non-zero element in each row, but that varies. For example, in Example0's output, the first row starts with 4,4,5,0. The input's first two rows have non-zero elements 4,4,5 and 4,4. So maybe taking the first non-zero from each row. But there are eight input rows and four output rows, so two input rows per output row.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair of input rows, the output row is the first two non-zero elements from the first row and the first two non-zero from the second row. For Example0's first two input rows:\n\nRow0:4,4,0,... \u2192 first two non-zero:4,4.\n\nRow1:4,4,0,... \u2192 first two non-zero:4,4.\n\nCombined:4,4,4,4. But output is [4,4,5,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair of input rows, take the first non-zero from each row. For row0 and row1, both start with 4. So output row would have 4,4. Then where do the 5 and 0 come from? Maybe taking the last non-zero from each row. Row0 has 5 as last non-zero. Row1 has no other non-zero. So output row is [4,4,5,0]. That matches. Then for the next pair of input rows (row2 and row3), first non-zero are 4 and 0 (row2 starts with 0, but first non-zero is at column2:4). Row3's first non-zero is 4 at column1. So output row would be 4 (from row2),4 (from row3), and then their last non-zero. Row2's last non-zero is5. Row3's last non-zero is5 (from columns4-5). So output row would be 4,4,5,5. But the actual output's second row is [6,6,6,9]. So this approach doesn't fit.\n\nBut wait, the second output row in Example0 is [6,6,6,9]. Looking at the input rows 4 and 5:\n\nRow4: [0,0,6,0,0,0,9,0] \u2192 first non-zero is6. Last non-zero is9.\n\nRow5: [6,6,6,0,0,0,0,9] \u2192 first non-zero is6. Last non-zero is9.\n\nSo if we take first non-zero from each row:6 and6. Then last non-zero:9 and9. Combined gives6,6,9,9. But the output row is [6,6,6,9]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe for each pair of input rows, the output row is formed by taking the first non-zero of the first row, the first non-zero of the second row, the last non-zero of the first row, and the last non-zero of the second row. For Example0's row0 and row1:\n\nRow0 first non-zero:4, row1 first non-zero:4.\n\nRow0 last non-zero:5, row1 last non-zero:4 (since row1 has 4,4). Wait, row1's elements are 4,4,0s. So last non-zero in row1 is the second 4. So output would be4,4,5,4. But the output row is4,4,5,0. So not quite.\n\nBut if row1's last non-zero is the last 4 (position1?), then maybe the output is [4,4,5,4]. But example0's first output row has [4,4,5,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting really complicated. Let's try to see if there's a pattern in the positions of the numbers in the output. For Example0's output:\n\nRow0:4,4,5,0 \u2192 numbers from first half of input (4,4,5) and a zero.\n\nRow1:6,6,6,9 \u2192 numbers from second half (6,6,6,9).\n\nRow2:6,9,5,6 \u2192 mix of second and first half numbers.\n\nRow3:5,5,6,0 \u2192 mix again.\n\nSo perhaps the output rows are alternately taking from the top and bottom halves, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by combining elements from the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right quadrants of the input. For example, each quadrant contributes to one row of the output. For Example0:\n\nTop-left quadrant (rows0-3, cols0-3):\n\nRow0:4,4,0,0\n\nRow1:4,4,0,0\n\nRow2:0,0,4,0\n\nRow3:0,4,0,0\n\nNon-zero elements:4,4,4,4,4. Maybe the first output row comes from here. But how?\n\nAlternatively, each quadrant is processed to give a value. For example, sum or max of each quadrant.\n\nTop-left quadrant's max is4. Top-right (rows0-3, cols4-7):\n\nRow0:0,0,5,0\n\nRow1:0,0,0,0\n\nRow2:0,0,5,0\n\nRow3:5,5,0,0\n\nMax here is5. Bottom-left quadrant (rows4-7, cols0-3):\n\nRow4:0,0,6,0\n\nRow5:6,6,6,0\n\nRow6:6,0,6,6\n\nRow7:0,6,6,0\n\nMax is6. Bottom-right (rows4-7, cols4-7):\n\nRow4:9,0\n\nRow5:0,9\n\nRow6:9,9,0,0\n\nRow7:9,0,0,0\n\nMax is9. So output would be4,5,6,9. But Example0's output is four rows, not one. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if each output cell is formed by some operation on two input cells. For instance, output cell (i,j) is the sum of input cell (2i, 2j) and input cell (2i+1, 2j+1). For example0's output cell (0,0):\n\ninput cell (0,0) =4, input cell (1,1)=4 \u2192 sum 8. Output is4. So maybe average. 8/2=4. Cell (0,1) would be input (0,2)=0 and (1,3)=0 \u2192 0. Output is4. Doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, output cell (i,j) is the maximum of input cells (2i, 2j), (2i, 2j+1), (2i+1, 2j), (2i+1, 2j+1). For cell (0,0):\n\nmax(4,4,4,4)=4. Output is4. Cell (0,1) would be max(0,0,0,0)=0. But output cell (0,1) is4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's think outside the box. The outputs in the examples have four elements per row, and the input rows are eight elements. Maybe each output row is formed by concatenating two elements from the first half of an input row and two from the second half. For example, input row0 has 4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0. First four elements:4,4,0,0. Last four:0,0,5,0. Taking first two (4,4) and last two (5,0) gives [4,4,5,0], which matches the first output row. Then, input row1's first two and last two:4,4 and0,0. Output row would be [4,4,0,0], but the next output row is [6,6,6,9]. Doesn't fit. Unless we are combining rows in pairs. For example, output row0 is first two of row0 and last two of row1. Row0 first two:4,4. Row1 last two:0,0. So [4,4,0,0]. Doesn't match. But the output row0 is [4,4,5,0]. So maybe take first two of row0 and last two of row0. Which is [4,4,5,0]. Then output row1 would be first two of row1 and last two of row1: [4,4,0,0]. But the actual output row1 is [6,6,6,9]. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the second row is [6,6,6,9]. Looking at input row5: [6,6,6,0,0,0,0,9]. Taking first three 6s and last 9 gives [6,6,6,9]. So if output row1 is formed by taking input row5's first three and last elements. Then output row1 would be [6,6,6,9]. That matches. Similarly, output row0 was from input row0's first two and last two. But row0's last two are 5,0. So [4,4,5,0].\n\nFollowing this pattern:\n\nOutput row0: input row0's first two elements and last two elements \u2192 [4,4,5,0].\n\nOutput row1: input row5's first three and last element \u2192 [6,6,6,9].\n\nOutput row2: input row6's first, third, fifth, sixth elements \u2192 [6,6,9,9] but output is [6,9,5,6]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output rows are formed by taking specific input rows and selecting certain elements. For Example0:\n\nOutput row0: input row0: elements 0,1,6,7 \u21924,4,5,0 \u2192 matches.\n\nOutput row1: input row5: elements 0,1,2,7 \u21926,6,6,9 \u2192 matches.\n\nOutput row2: input row6: elements 0,4,6,2 \u21926,9,0,6 \u2192 no. Output row2 is [6,9,5,6]. So maybe elements from different rows.\n\nAlternatively, output row2:6 (from row5),9 (from row4),5 (from row2),6 (from row6). Not sure.\n\nThis approach seems possible for the first two output rows but not the others. Let's check other examples. For Example1's first output row [5,5,0,6]. Let's see if this comes from input row0's first two and last two elements. Row0: [4,0,0,4,5,5,0,0]. First two:4,0. Last two:0,0. So [4,0,0,0]. Doesn't match the output row [5,5,0,6]. So this approach doesn't work for other examples.\n\nAlternative idea: The output rows might be formed by taking the non-zero elements from two input rows, but selecting the first two non-zero from the first row and the first two non-zero from the second row. For example0's first two rows:\n\nRow0:4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0 \u2192 non-zero:4,4,5.\n\nRow1:4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 non-zero:4,4.\n\nTake first two from row0:4,4. First two from row1:4,4. Combined as [4,4,4,4]. Output is [4,4,5,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the test input, the output should follow the same pattern. Let's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0,4,0,4,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,4,4,4,5,0,5,5]\n\nRow2: [4,4,4,0,0,5,5,5]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [6,0,6,6,9,9,9,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,6,0,9,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,6,0,0,0,0,9,9]\n\nRow7: [6,0,0,0,0,9,0,0]\n\nIf the pattern is to take elements 0,1,6,7 from each pair of rows, then:\n\nFor output row0, take row0's 0,1,6,7:0,4,0,0 \u2192 [0,4,0,0]. But the first output example's first row started with 4,4. Maybe this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair of rows, the first output row is row0's elements 0,1 and row1's elements 6,7. So row0's 0,1:0,4. Row1's 6,7:5,5. Combined as [0,4,5,5]. But the first example's output starts with 4,4. So not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In all training examples, the output has four rows, each with four elements. The input has eight rows. Maybe each output row is formed by combining two input rows. For example, output row0 is input row0 and row1, row2 is input row2 and row3, etc. But how to combine them.\n\nLet's think of the output as a 4x4 matrix. Each cell in the output corresponds to two cells in the input. Maybe the output cell (i,j) is the sum of input cell (i*2, j*2) and input cell (i*2+1, j*2+1). For example, Example0's output cell (0,0) would be input0's (0,0) + input1's (1,1):4+4=8. But output is4. So maybe take the average:8/2=4. Cell (0,1) would be input0's (0,2) + input1's (1,3):0+0=0. Output is4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, output cell (i,j) is input cell (i*2, j*2) if it's non-zero, else input cell (i*2+1, j*2). For Example0's (0,0):4 is non-zero. Output is4. (0,1) input0's (0,2)=0, so check input1's (1,2)=0. Still zero, but output is4. Doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: Each output row is made by taking elements from two consecutive input rows, but picking the elements from even positions in the first row and odd positions in the second row. For example, row0 of output is even indices of input row0 and odd indices of input row1. Let's check Example0:\n\nRow0:4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0 \u2192 even indices (0,2,4,6) \u21924,0,0,5.\n\nRow1:4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 odd indices (1,3,5,7) \u21924,0,0,0.\n\nCombining them as even from row0 and odd from row1:4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0 \u2192 but output row0 is [4,4,5,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, take elements from even indices of row0 and row1. But that would be 4,0,0,5 from row0 and 4,0,0,0 from row1. Combining into a row:4,0,0,5,4,0,0,0. Then take first four non-zero:4,5,4. Output is [4,4,5,0]. Still not matching.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to think of a different approach. Maybe the output is generated by taking the non-zero elements from the input, arranged in a specific order, but grouped by their values. For example, first row is all 4s, then 5s, then 6s, then 9s. But looking at Example0's output, the first row has 4,4,5,0. Not grouped by value.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are made by taking the non-zero elements from each quadrant of the input. For example, top-left quadrant's non-zero elements form the first output row, top-right the second, and so on. Let's see:\n\nExample0's input top-left quadrant (rows0-3, cols0-3):\n\nRow0:4,4,0,0\n\nRow1:4,4,0,0\n\nRow2:0,0,4,0\n\nRow3:0,4,0,0\n\nNon-zero elements:4,4,4,4,4. The first output row is [4,4,5,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, top-left quadrant's non-zero elements are 4,4,4,4,4. Take first four:4,4,4,4. Output row0 is [4,4,5,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is a result of some mathematical operation between elements of the input. For example, differences, products, or ratios. But this seems unlikely given the examples.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe each output row is formed by taking the first two non-zero elements from two different rows. For example, output row0: first two non-zero from row0 and row4. In Example0:\n\nRow0's first two non-zero:4,4.\n\nRow4's first two non-zero:6,9.\n\nCombined:4,4,6,9. But output row0 is [4,4,5,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, row0's first two non-zero and row4's last two non-zero. Row4's last two non-zero:9. So [4,4,9,0]. No.\n\nAlternatively, row0's first three non-zero and row4's first non-zero. 4,4,5,6 \u2192 but output row0 is [4,4,5,0]. So no.\n\nPerhaps this is a dead end. Let's try to look for another pattern. Notice that in all examples, the output rows have a mix of two types of numbers: in Example0, 4 and 5 in the first row, 6 and 9 in the second. Perhaps these pairs correspond to some grouping in the input. For example, the numbers 4 and 5 are in the first half of the input, and 6 and 9 in the second half. So each output row combines elements from both halves.\n\nFor example, output row0 is a combination of elements from input rows 0 and 4. Let's check Example0:\n\nRow0:4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0\n\nRow4:0,0,6,0,0,0,9,0\n\nOutput row0:4,4,5,0. The 4s are from row0, 5 from row0, and 0 from row4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, output row0 takes elements from row0's first two and row4's first two. Row0's first two:4,4. Row4's first two:0,0. Combined as [4,4,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for a pattern in the positions of the numbers in the output. For example, in Example0's output:\n\nThe first row has 4,4,5,0.\n\nLooking at the input's rows 0 and 1:\n\nRow0: 4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0\n\nRow1:4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nIf I take elements 0,1,6 from row0 and element 0 from row1:4,4,5,4 \u2192 but output is4,4,5,0. No.\n\nAlternatively, elements 0,1 from row0 (4,4), elements 6,7 from row0 (5,0) \u2192 [4,4,5,0], which matches output row0. Then for output row1, elements 0,1 from row5 (6,6), elements 6,7 from row5 (0,9) \u2192 [6,6,0,9], but output row1 is [6,6,6,9]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut if we take elements 0,1,2 from row5 (6,6,6) and element 7 (9), we get [6,6,6,9], which matches output row1. So maybe for even-numbered output rows (0,2) we take elements from the first half of the input, and for odd-numbered output rows (1,3) we take elements from the second half. Let's check:\n\nExample0's output row2: [6,9,5,6]. If we take elements from row6 and row7. Row6:6,0,6,6,9,9,0,0. Maybe elements 0,4,6 from row6:6,9,0. Row7:0,6,6,0,9,0,0,0. Taking element1:6. Combined:6,9,0,6. Output row2 is [6,9,5,6]. Doesn't fit. But the 5 may come from row2's 5. So perhaps this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother possible pattern: Each output row is formed by selecting elements from two different input rows, one from the top four and one from the bottom four. For example, output row0 combines elements from row0 and row4. Let's see:\n\nRow0's elements:4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0.\n\nRow4's elements:0,0,6,0,0,0,9,0.\n\nMaybe output row0 takes the first non-zero from row0 (4), the second non-zero from row0 (4), the first non-zero from row4 (6), and the second non-zero from row4 (9). But the output row0 is [4,4,5,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, output row0 takes the first non-zero from row0 (4), the next non-zero from row0 (4), then the first non-zero from row4 (6), then the next non-zero from row4 (9). This would give [4,4,6,9], but the output row0 is [4,4,5,0]. So no.\n\nThis is taking too long. Let's try to make an educated guess based on some of the observations. For example, in Example0's output, the first row is [4,4,5,0], which corresponds to the first two non-zero elements from row0 (4,4), followed by the fifth non-zero from row0 (5), and a zero. But the fifth non-zero in row0's non-zero list is 5. But row0's non-zero are 4,4,5. Maybe the output rows are formed by taking the first four non-zero elements from the input, but grouped in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking each pair of input rows and concatenating their non-zero elements, then taking the first four elements of that concatenation. Let's test this with Example0's first two input rows:\n\nRow0:4,4,5 \u2192 non-zero.\n\nRow1:4,4 \u2192 non-zero.\n\nCombined:4,4,5,4,4. First four:4,4,5,4. Output is [4,4,5,0]. Not matching. But the output has a zero. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the combined non-zero elements are taken in order, and if there are less than four, pad with zeros. So for row0 and row1, combined non-zero are 4,4,5,4,4. Take first four:4,4,5,4. Output is [4,4,5,0]. So maybe padding with zero if there are exactly four, but no. This doesn't fit.\n\nBut the output row0 is [4,4,5,0]. So the fourth element is zero, but the combined non-zero from rows0 and row1 have five elements. So why is the fourth element zero? This is confusing.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Looking at the test input, perhaps each output row is formed by taking elements from two input rows: the first two elements of the first row and the last two elements of the second row. For example, in test input:\n\nRow0:0,4,0,4,5,0,0,0 \u2192 first two:0,4; last two:0,0 \u2192 [0,4,0,0].\n\nRow1:0,4,4,4,5,0,5,5 \u2192 first two:0,4; last two:5,5 \u2192 [0,4,5,5].\n\nBut the output would need to be 4 rows. Maybe combining rows0 and1, rows2 and3, rows4 and5, rows6 and7.\n\nFor test input:\n\nRows0-1:\n\nRow0 first two:0,4; row1 last two:5,5 \u2192 combined [0,4,5,5].\n\nRows2-3:\n\nRow2 first two:4,4; row3 last two:0,0 \u2192 [4,4,0,0].\n\nRows4-5:\n\nRow4 first two:6,0; row5 last two:0,0 \u2192 [6,0,0,0].\n\nRows6-7:\n\nRow6 first two:0,6; row7 last two:0,0 \u2192 [0,6,0,0].\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the training examples' output formats. For example, Example0's first output row was formed by row0's first two and row0's last two. But in this case, combining rows0 and1 doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output is created by taking the maximum value from each 2x2 block of the input. For Example0's first 2x2 block (rows0-1, cols0-1):\n\n4,4\n\n4,4 \u2192 max 4. Output cell0,0:4.\n\nNext block (cols2-3, rows0-1):\n\n0,0\n\n0,0 \u2192 max 0. Output cell0,1:4. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this is not the case.\n\nAfter struggling for a while, I'll try to look for a pattern where each output row is formed by combining specific elements from two input rows. For Example0's output row0:4,4,5,0. It seems that these are the first two elements of row0 (4,4), then the sixth and seventh elements of row0 (5,0). So row0's elements [0,1,6,7] \u21924,4,5,0. Let's check if this holds.\n\nFor Example0's row0: [4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0]. Taking positions0,1,6,7 \u21924,4,5,0 \u2192 matches output row0.\n\nRow1 is [4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. positions0,1,6,7 \u21924,4,0,0. But output row1 is [6,6,6,9]. So no. But maybe the output rows are not formed from consecutive input rows.\n\nAlternatively, output rows are formed by taking rows0,5,2,6, etc. For example, row0 of output is from input row0's positions0,1,6,7. Row1 of output is from input row5's positions0,1,6,7. Row2 from input row2's positions0,1,6,7. Row3 from input row7's positions0,1,6,7.\n\nFor Example0's row5: [6,6,6,0,0,0,0,9]. positions0,1,6,7 \u21926,6,0,9. Output row1 is [6,6,6,9]. So no. But the sixth and seventh elements are 0,9. So output would be [6,6,0,9], but actual output is [6,6,6,9].\n\nSo this doesn't work. But if for row5 we take positions0,1,2,7 \u21926,6,6,9. Which matches output row1.\n\nSimilarly, for row2 of Example0: [0,0,4,0,0,0,5,0]. positions0,1,6,7 \u21920,0,5,0. Output row2 is [6,9,5,6]. Doesn't match. So this approach doesn't hold.\n\nBut in Example0's output row1 is [6,6,6,9], which matches input row5's first three elements (6,6,6) and last element (9). So maybe the output rows are formed by taking the first three elements of a certain row and the last element of another row. For example, output row1 is input row5's first three and row5's last element. Which is [6,6,6,9].\n\nSimilarly, output row0 is input row0's first two and row0's sixth and seventh elements.\n\nBut why would the pattern vary per row? It's possible that each output row is formed from a different input row, selecting specific elements.\n\nFor Example0's output row2: [6,9,5,6]. Maybe elements from row6 and row2. Row6:6,0,6,6,9,9,0,0. Take elements 0,4,6 \u21926,9,0. Row2's 6th element is5. So combining 6,9,5,6. But where does the last 6 come from? Maybe from row7's second element (6).\n\nThis seems too arbitrary. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess based on the observation that in Example0, output rows 0 and 1 are formed by taking specific parts of input rows0 and5. For the test input, perhaps the output rows are formed similarly.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow0:0,4,0,4,5,0,0,0 \u2192 first two elements 0,4; sixth and seventh elements 0,0 \u2192 [0,4,0,0].\n\nRow5:0,0,0,6,0,9,0,0 \u2192 first three elements 0,0,0; last element 0 \u2192 but that gives [0,0,0,0]. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, row4:6,0,6,6,9,9,9,0 \u2192 first three elements 6,0,6; last element 0 \u2192 [6,0,6,0].\n\nBut looking at Example0's output row1 which came from row5's first three and last element, maybe the test input's output row1 would be from row5's first three (0,0,0) and last element (0) \u2192 [0,0,0,0]. But this seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, in the test input, maybe the first output row is formed by taking elements from row1. Row1:0,4,4,4,5,0,5,5. Taking first three non-zero elements:4,4,4,5 \u2192 but output rows have four elements. So [4,4,4,5], but not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the pattern that each output row is formed by taking elements from specific positions of two input rows. For example, rows0 and1 for output row0, rows2 and3 for row1, etc. But given the lack of clear pattern, I'll try to generate the test output based on the previous examples' structure.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows:\n\nRow0:0,4,0,4,5,0,0,0\n\nRow1:0,4,4,4,5,0,5,5\n\nRow2:4,4,4,0,0,5,5,5\n\nRow3:0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n\nRow4:6,0,6,6,9,9,9,0\n\nRow5:0,0,0,6,0,9,0,0\n\nRow6:0,6,0,0,0,0,9,9\n\nRow7:6,0,0,0,0,9,0,0\n\nAssuming that each output row is formed by taking elements from specific positions of two input rows. For example:\n\nOutput row0: elements from row0 and row1.\n\nOutput row1: elements from row2 and row3.\n\nOutput row2: elements from row4 and row5.\n\nOutput row3: elements from row6 and row7.\n\nFor each output row, maybe take the first two non-zero elements from the first row and the first two non-zero elements from the second row, padding with zeros if necessary.\n\nLet's try this for the test input:\n\nOutput row0: row0 and row1.\n\nRow0's non-zero:4,4,5.\n\nRow1's non-zero:4,4,4,5,5,5.\n\nTake first two from row0:4,4. First two from row1:4,4. Combined:4,4,4,4. But the output needs four elements. Maybe [4,4,4,4]. But looking at training examples, outputs often have a mix of different numbers.\n\nAlternatively, take first non-zero from each row until four elements are gathered. For row0 and row1 combined:4 (row0),4 (row0),5 (row0),4 (row1). So [4,4,5,4].\n\nBut training examples show that outputs often have a mix of different numbers. For example, Example0's row0 has 4,4,5,0. So perhaps in the test case, row0's output would be [4,4,5,5], from row0's 4,4,5 and row1's first 5.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row1's non-zero elements:4,4,4,5,5,5. Maybe the output row0 is [4,4,5,5].\n\nBut I'm not sure. Another approach is to look for common elements in the test input and see how they might form the output.\n\nFor example, the test input's row1 has several 4s and 5s. Row4 has 6s and 9s. Row5 has 6 and 9. Row6 has 6 and 9. Row7 has 6 and 9.\n\nIn the training examples, outputs often combine 4/5 with 6/9. So the test output might have rows like [5,5,6,9], [4,5,5,5], etc.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, this is just guessing. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the examples and the test input structure.\n\nFinal answer:",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input grids of 8 rows each with 8 numbers, and the output is a 4x4 grid. The first thing I need to do is understand how the input is transformed into the output. Let me look at the training examples to spot any patterns.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has 8 rows of 8 elements each. The output is 4 rows of 4 elements each. Maybe the input is split into two parts? Let me see. The input could be divided into two 4x4 grids, but looking at the output, each row in the output is formed by combining elements from two rows in the input. For instance, in Example 0's input:\n\nFirst input row: [4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0]\nSecond input row: [4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nThen the first output row is [4,4,5,0]. Hmm. Maybe taking the first four elements from the first row and the last four from the second? Let's check. The first four of row 1 are 4,4,0,0. The last four of row 2 are 0,0,0,0. That doesn't match the output [4,4,5,0]. Wait, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the positions of non-zero numbers. For example, in the first two rows of input in Example 0, the first row has 4,4 and then 5 at position 6. The second row has 4,4 but ends with zeros. The output's first row is 4,4,5,0. Maybe combining non-zero elements from adjacent rows. Or perhaps adding elements from two rows in some way.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe each output row is formed by taking two input rows and combining them, but only taking certain elements. Let's see. For example 0's first output row is [4,4,5,0]. The first two input rows are [4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0] and [4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. If we take the first two elements of the first row (4,4), then the 5 from the first row's sixth position (since 0-based index, position 5 is 5?), but how does that fit into the output? The output's third element is 5. Then the last element is 0. Maybe looking at the first two elements of the first row, then the sixth element of the first row, and the sixth element of the second row? Let's check. First row's sixth element is 5 (index 5 is 0, index 6 is 5?), wait the input rows are 8 elements. So positions 0-7. The first input row's elements at 0:4, 1:4, then 6:5. The second input row's element at 6:0. So combining first two from row1 (4,4), then 5 from row1, 0 from row2's 6th position. That would make 4,4,5,0, which matches the first output row. Let me check the next output row.\n\nSecond output row of Example0 is [6,6,6,9]. The third and fourth input rows are [0,0,4,0,0,0,5,0] and [0,4,0,0,5,5,0,0]. Wait, maybe each output row is formed by two input rows. Wait, in Example0's input there are 8 rows. The output has 4 rows. So perhaps each output row is formed by combining two input rows. For example, the first two input rows form the first output row, the next two form the second output row, etc. So for the first output row, combining rows 0 and 1. Second output row from rows 2 and 3. Third from rows 4 and5. Fourth from rows6 and7.\n\nLet's check. For Example0's output row 2: [6,9,5,6]. Looking at input rows 4 and5. Input row4 is [0,0,6,0,0,0,9,0]. Row5 is [6,6,6,0,0,0,0,9]. So combining these two rows. Maybe take elements from certain positions. For row4, the 6 is at position 2, 9 at position6. Row5 has 6s in positions0,1,2 and 9 in position7. So maybe combining the non-zero elements. But output row is 6,9,5,6. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe taking elements from the positions where the two rows have non-zero values. Like, for each position in the combined rows, take the non-zero value. But how does that form the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each pair of two input rows, the output row is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the two rows, in order. For example, the first two input rows:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0]\nRow1: [4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe non-zero elements in row0 are 4,4,5. Row1 has 4,4. So combining them, but the output row is [4,4,5,0]. Maybe taking the first two non-zero from row0, then the next two non-zero from row1? But row1 only has two non-zero. Alternatively, maybe interleave the non-zero elements. But this might not fit.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output elements, perhaps each output row is a combination of the first two rows, but taking elements from specific columns. For example, in the first output row of Example0, the elements are 4,4 (from the first two elements of row0 and row1?), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the output row is formed by taking elements from the two input rows where the sum is non-zero. Wait, maybe for each pair of two input rows, the output is the sum of each pair of elements, but that doesn't match. For example, 4+4=8, but the output has 4,4, which suggests maybe not sum.\n\nWait, let's look at the first two rows of Example0:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0]\nRow1: [4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput row0: [4,4,5,0]\n\nLooking at the positions where the elements are non-zero in either row. Row0 has 4,4,5. Row1 has 4,4. So combining these and taking the first four non-zero in order? But output has four elements. So maybe 4 (from row0[0]), 4 (row0[1]), 5 (row0[6]), and then 0. But where does the 0 come from? Or perhaps, after combining the non-zero elements from both rows, and then taking the first four. But row0 and row1 have 4,4,5 (from row0) and 4,4 (from row1). Combining these gives 4,4,5,4,4. Then taking the first four would be 4,4,5,4. But the output is 4,4,5,0. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row is formed by taking the first non-zero element from each of the four pairs of columns across the two rows. Let's think. For the first two rows:\n\nColumns 0: 4 (row0) and 4 (row1) \u2192 take 4 (since non-zero)\nColumn1: 4 and4 \u2192 take 4\nColumn2: 0 and0 \u2192 take 0, but output has 5 here. Wait, no. Maybe the output is formed by taking from columns in a different way. Let's see. The output has four elements. So perhaps each output element is from a pair of columns. Like, columns 0-1 of row0 and row1 for the first output element, columns 2-3 for the second, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is split into 4x4 grids. The original input is 8x8. Split into four 4x4 grids. Then combine them. For example, the first four rows form a 4x8 grid, which could be split into two 4x4 grids. Similarly for the last four rows. Then maybe combine them in some way. But the output is 4x4, so maybe each quadrant is processed.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the outputs, sometimes numbers like 5, 9, 6, 4 are present. These could correspond to the non-zero numbers in the input. So maybe each output cell is the sum or count of certain numbers in the input's corresponding region. For example, each output row is a combination of two input rows, and each output cell corresponds to a pair of columns. Let's take Example0's first output row [4,4,5,0]. If we look at the first two input rows:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0]\nRow1: [4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nIf we pair columns 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7 from each row. For columns 0-1 in row0: 4,4. Row1's 0-1:4,4. The first output element is 4. Maybe taking the maximum, but both are 4. Or the sum, 4+4=8. But output is 4,4. Alternatively, maybe the first output element is the first non-zero from row0, then the first non-zero from row1. But not sure.\n\nWait, in the first output row of Example0, the elements are 4,4,5,0. Let's look at the first two input rows. The non-zero elements in row0 are 4 (positions 0 and1), 5 (position6). Row1 has 4 (positions0 and1). So perhaps the output is formed by taking the first two non-zero elements from row0 (4,4), then the next non-zero from row0 (5), and then the next non-zero from row1. But row1's non-zero are 4,4. But output's fourth element is 0, which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking elements from specific positions in the two rows. For example, in the first two rows, the output's first element is row0[0], the second is row0[1], the third is row0[6], the fourth is row1[6]. Let's check:\n\nRow0[0] =4, row0[1]=4, row0[6]=5, row1[6]=0. So 4,4,5,0. Which matches the first output row. That seems to fit. Let's check the second output row of Example0. The output is [6,6,6,9]. The input rows 2 and3 are:\n\nRow2: [0,0,4,0,0,0,5,0]\nRow3: [0,4,0,0,5,5,0,0]\n\nTaking row2's 0th element (0), but output starts with 6. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Wait, maybe for the output row, each element is taken from different positions. Let me check the output rows in Example0:\n\nOutput row0: [4,4,5,0] \u2192 from rows0 and1: positions (0,1,6,6)\nOutput row1: [6,6,6,9] \u2192 from rows2 and3: ?\n\nRow2: [0,0,4,0,0,0,5,0]\nRow3: [0,4,0,0,5,5,0,0]\n\nIf the output elements are taken from positions 2 (row2[2]=4?), but output starts with 6. So this approach might not be correct.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is formed by taking the sum of certain elements. Let's think about the numbers in the output. For example, in Example0's output row0: 4,4,5,0. The sum of elements in row0 and row1 is 8 (each has 4+4) plus 5 from row0. But not sure.\n\nWait, maybe looking for another pattern. Let's check the output for Example0. The output has 4 rows. Each row has four elements. The first two rows of the output in Example0 are [4,4,5,0] and [6,6,6,9]. Let's look at the input's first four rows. The first two input rows are about 4s and 5s. The next two rows (rows2 and3) have 4, 5s. The output's first two rows have 4,4,5 and 6,6,6,9. Then the output rows 3 and4 are [6,9,5,6], [5,5,6,0]. The numbers 6 and 9 are present in the input's latter rows (rows4-7). So maybe the output rows are combining pairs of input rows, but each output row is formed from two input rows, perhaps selecting elements from the non-zero numbers in those two rows.\n\nAnother thought: The input has 8 rows. The output has 4 rows, each perhaps combining two input rows. For each pair of rows, maybe concatenate them and then take the non-zero elements, padding with zeros to make 4 elements. Let's check Example0's first two input rows:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0] \u2192 non-zeros: 4,4,5\nRow1: [4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zeros:4,4\nCombined non-zeros:4,4,5,4,4. Take first four:4,4,5,4. But output is [4,4,5,0]. So that's not matching. Unless the combined non-zero from both rows, and then first four, but if there aren't enough, pad with zeros. Wait, in this case, 4,4,5 from row0 and 4,4 from row1 \u2192 combined in order would be 4,4,5,4,4. Take first four \u2192 4,4,5,4. But output is 4,4,5,0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of each two corresponding elements from the two input rows, but then taking only the first four and last four? For example, row0 and row1:\n\nRow0:4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0\nRow1:4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nSumming each pair: 8,8,0,0,0,0,5,0. Then take first four elements (8,8,0,0) and last four (0,0,5,0). But the output is 4,4,5,0. Hmm, maybe not. Unless there's a different operation, like max. Taking max of each pair:\n\nFor each position i, max(row0[i], row1[i]):\n\n4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0. Then taking first four and last four. First four:4,4,0,0. Last four:0,0,5,0. But output row0 is [4,4,5,0]. So maybe taking the first two of the first four (4,4) and the first two of the last four (5,0). Wait, that would be 4,4,5,0. Oh! That matches. Let's check:\n\nIn the first two rows of input, after taking max of each column, we get:\n\nmax(4,4)=4, max(4,4)=4, max(0,0)=0, max(0,0)=0, max(0,0)=0, max(0,0)=0, max(5,0)=5, max(0,0)=0.\n\nThen split this into two halves: first four elements [4,4,0,0], and last four [0,0,5,0]. Then take the first two from the first half (4,4) and the first two from the second half (5,0). Combining them gives [4,4,5,0], which is exactly the first output row. Let's check if this works for the next example.\n\nLooking at Example0's output row1: [6,6,6,9]. The input rows 2 and3 are:\n\nRow2: [0,0,4,0,0,0,5,0]\nRow3: [0,4,0,0,5,5,0,0]\n\nTaking max of each column:\n\n0 vs 0 \u2192 0 (col0)\n0 vs4 \u21924 (col1)\n4 vs0 \u21924 (col2)\n0 vs0 \u21920 (col3)\n0 vs5 \u21925 (col4)\n0 vs5 \u21925 (col5)\n5 vs0 \u21925 (col6)\n0 vs0 \u21920 (col7)\n\nSo the max row is [0,4,4,0,5,5,5,0]. Split into first four [0,4,4,0] and last four [5,5,5,0]. Take first two of first half (0,4) and first two of last half (5,5). But the output row is [6,6,6,9]. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Wait, maybe this approach isn't correct. Let's check another example.\n\nLet's take Example1's first output row: [5,5,0,6]. The first two input rows are:\n\nRow0: [4,0,0,4,5,5,0,0]\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5]\n\nMax of each column:\n\n4,0,0,4,5,5,5,5.\n\nSplit into first four [4,0,0,4] and last four [5,5,5,5]. Take first two from first (4,0) and first two from last (5,5). But the output row is [5,5,0,6]. Doesn't match. So perhaps the previous idea is wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: For each pair of input rows, look for the numbers in the two rows. For example, in Example0's output row0, the elements are 4,4,5,0. The input rows 0 and1 have 4,4,5 (from row0) and 4,4 (row1). So maybe combining them, but the output has 4,4,5, and 0. Maybe the first two elements from row0, then the next two non-zero from row1. But row1 only has two. So 4,4,5, and then zero. But where does the 5 come from? Oh, row0 has a 5 in position6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is formed by taking the first two non-zero elements from each of the two input rows. For example, row0's first two non-zeros are 4,4. Row1's first two non-zeros are 4,4. So combining them as 4,4,4,4. But the output is 4,4,5,0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the two input rows, in the order they appear, and then taking the first four. For example, row0 has non-zeros 4,4,5. Row1 has 4,4. Combined, they are 4,4,5,4,4. Then take the first four:4,4,5,4. But the output is 4,4,5,0. So that's not matching. Unless they're ordered in a different way.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the test input and trying to see how the output is generated. But perhaps focusing on another training example.\n\nLooking at Example4's input:\n\nINPUT:\nRow0: [0,4,4,4,0,5,5,5]\nRow1: [0,0,4,0,5,5,0,5]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\nRow3: [4,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\nRow4: [6,6,0,6,0,0,9,9]\nRow5: [0,0,0,6,9,0,9,0]\nRow6: [0,0,0,6,9,0,9,9]\nRow7: [6,6,0,6,0,9,0,9]\n\nOUTPUT:\n[6,5,5,5]\n[5,5,9,5]\n[5,0,9,6]\n[5,6,0,6]\n\nLooking at the first output row [6,5,5,5]. Let's see which input rows this corresponds to. If each output row is from two input rows, rows0 and1, rows2 and3, etc.\n\nRows0 and1:\n\nRow0: 0,4,4,4,0,5,5,5 \u2192 non-zeros:4,4,4,5,5,5\nRow1:0,0,4,0,5,5,0,5 \u2192 non-zeros:4,5,5,5\nCombined non-zeros:4,4,4,5,5,5,4,5,5,5. Take first four? 4,4,4,5. But output starts with 6. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is from rows4 and5. Let's check:\n\nRow4:6,6,0,6,0,0,9,9 \u2192 non-zeros:6,6,6,9,9\nRow5:0,0,0,6,9,0,9,0 \u2192 non-zeros:6,9,9\nCombined:6,6,6,9,9,6,9,9. Take first four:6,6,6,9. Output's first row is [6,5,5,5]. Hmm, no.\n\nWait, perhaps the output rows are formed by combining elements from two input rows in a different way. Let's think about the output for Example4:\n\nOutput row0: [6,5,5,5]. How do 6 and 5 come from the input? Looking at the input rows, 6s are in rows4-7, 5s in rows0-3.\n\nBut output row0 is [6,5,5,5]. Maybe the output rows are formed by combining elements from the first four rows (which have 4s and 5s) and the last four rows (6s and 9s). For example, each output row combines one element from the first four rows and one from the last four. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell corresponds to a 2x2 block in the input. For example, each 2x2 block in the input is mapped to a single element in the output. But the input is 8x8, so 4x4 blocks would give 4x4 output. But how to map 2x2 to one element. Perhaps sum, max, or non-zero count.\n\nWait, for Example0's first output row [4,4,5,0], maybe the input's first two rows and first two columns contribute to this. Let's see. The input rows0 and1 are:\n\nRow0:4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0\nRow1:4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nIf each output cell is the sum of a 2x2 block in the input. But the output has 4 elements per row, so each row in the output would correspond to two rows and two columns in the input. Let's try this. For example, the first two rows and first two columns (4,4 in row0, and 4,4 in row1). The sum would be 4+4+4+4=16, but output is 4. So maybe take the maximum instead. Max of 4,4,4,4 is 4. Then the next 2x2 block: columns 2-3, rows0-1: 0,0 and 0,0. Max is 0. But the first output row has 4,4,5,0. So this doesn't fit. Alternatively, take the sum of non-zero elements. But in the first block, there are four 4s, sum 16. Doesn't fit. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the numbers in the output. The output often has numbers like 4,5,6,9, which are present in the input. Maybe the output is a rearrangement or mapping of these numbers from the input. For instance, the output could be formed by taking certain elements from the input and arranging them into a 4x4 grid. \n\nLooking at Example0's input and output:\n\nOutput row0: [4,4,5,0]. The first two rows have 4s in the first two positions and a 5 in the sixth position. The output's third element is 5, which might come from row0's sixth element (5). The fourth element is 0, which is row1's sixth element (0). So perhaps each output element is formed by combining elements from the same position in two different rows. For example, output row0's elements are:\n\nelement0: row0[0], element1: row0[1], element2: row0[6], element3: row1[6]\n\nThat gives 4,4,5,0 which matches the output. Let's check this for other rows.\n\nIn Example0's output row1: [6,6,6,9]. Which input rows are these from? Output row1 would be formed by rows2 and3. So:\n\nelement0: row2[0], row2[1] \u2192 but row2[0] is 0. So that doesn't fit. Hmm. Maybe the pattern is different.\n\nWait, let's consider each output row is formed by taking two input rows and combining specific positions. For example, the first output row takes elements from positions 0,1,6,7 of the two input rows. Let's try this for Example0:\n\nRow0: positions0,1,6,7 \u2192 4,4,5,0\nRow1: positions0,1,6,7 \u21924,4,0,0\nCombine them by taking row0's first three elements and row1's fourth? Not sure. Or maybe alternating between the two rows. For example, output elements are row0[0], row0[1], row0[6], row1[7]. Which would give 4,4,5,0, which matches output row0. Then for output row1 (rows2 and3):\n\nRow2:0,0,4,0,0,0,5,0 \u2192 positions0,1,6,7:0,0,5,0\nRow3:0,4,0,0,5,5,0,0 \u2192 positions0,1,6,7:0,4,0,0\nCombining: row2[0]=0, row2[1]=0, row2[6]=5, row3[7]=0 \u2192 0,0,5,0. But the output row1 is [6,6,6,9]. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternative idea: The output elements are formed by taking the sum of the corresponding positions in two rows. For example, for output row0:\n\nsum(row0[i] + row1[i] for i in 0-3 and 4-7), but how to arrange into 4 elements. Alternatively, each output row is formed by taking two elements from each of the two input rows. For example, first two elements of row0, then first two elements of row1. But row0's first two are 4,4 and row1's first two are4,4 \u2192 output row would be [4,4,4,4], which doesn't match.\n\nAnother pattern: The output is formed by selecting the numbers that are present in the input rows but in a different order. For example, the output row0 in Example0 is [4,4,5,0], and the input rows0 and1 have 4,4,5 and 4,4. So the output includes all the unique non-zero numbers from both rows, but that doesn't fit. For example, unique numbers are 4 and5. But output has four elements.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the non-zero elements from each of the two input rows, concatenated and then padded with zeros to make four elements. For example, rows0 and1 in Example0 have non-zeros 4,4,5 and4,4. Concatenated gives 4,4,5,4,4. Take first four:4,4,5,4. But output is [4,4,5,0]. Hmm, not matching. Unless the order is different, like taking non-zero from row0 first, then row1. If row0 has 4,4,5 and row1 has4,4, then concatenating gives 4,4,5,4,4. Take first four, but output is 4,4,5,0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the first input row and then the non-zero elements from the second input row, but limited to four elements. So for Example0's first output row: row0's non-zeros are4,4,5; row1's non-zeros are4,4. Combined in order:4,4,5,4. That's four elements. But the output is4,4,5,0. So this doesn't fit unless there's a mistake.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the two input rows, but alternating between them. For example, row0's first non-zero, then row1's first non-zero, then row0's next, row1's next. For Example0's first two rows:\n\nRow0's non-zeros:4,4,5\nRow1's non-zeros:4,4\nAlternating:4 (row0),4 (row1),4 (row0),4 (row1),5 (row0). Take first four:4,4,4,4. But output is4,4,5,0. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to look for another approach.\n\nLooking at Example0's input and output, perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from the input in a specific way, such as diagonals or certain patterns. For example, the output for Example0's first row is [4,4,5,0]. The input's first two rows have 4s in positions 0,1 and 0,1. Then a 5 in position6 of row0. The 0 is from position6 of row1. So maybe each output element is from a specific position in the two input rows. For example:\n\nOutput row0: row0[0], row0[1], row0[6], row1[6]\n\nThis gives 4,4,5,0 which matches. Let's check this for other rows.\n\nExample0's output row1 is [6,6,6,9]. It's formed from input rows2 and3.\n\nRow2: [0,0,4,0,0,0,5,0]\nRow3: [0,4,0,0,5,5,0,0]\n\nUsing the same pattern: row2[0], row2[1], row2[6], row3[6]\n\nrow2[0]=0, row2[1]=0, row2[6]=5, row3[6]=0 \u2192 output would be [0,0,5,0], which doesn't match. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps each output row is formed by combining four elements from the two input rows, taking two elements from each row. For example, take the first two non-zero from row0 and the first two non-zero from row1. For Example0's first two rows:\n\nRow0's non-zero:4,4,5 \u2192 first two are4,4\nRow1's non-zero:4,4 \u2192 first two are4,4\nCombined:4,4,4,4. Output is [4,4,5,0], which doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a pattern involving the positions where numbers appear. Let's look at the output for Example0:\n\nOutput row0: [4,4,5,0]\nRow0 has 4s at positions0 and1, 5 at6.\nRow1 has 4s at0 and1.\n\nOutput row1: [6,6,6,9]\nInput rows2 and3:\nRow2: 4 at position2, 5 at6.\nRow3:4 at1, 5 at4 and5.\n\nBut output row1 has 6,6,6,9. These numbers don't appear in rows2 and3. So perhaps the output rows are not directly from the first four rows but from the entire input.\n\nWait, looking at the input rows for Example0:\n\nRows0-3: dealing with 4 and5.\nRows4-7: dealing with 6 and9.\n\nOutput for Example0 has rows that include 4,5,6,9. So perhaps each output row combines elements from both the 4/5 group and the 6/9 group.\n\nFor example, output row0: combines elements from row0 (4,4,5) and row4 (6,9). But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 4x4 grid where each row is formed by combining two rows from the input, one from the upper half (rows0-3) and one from the lower half (rows4-7). For example, output row0 is row0 and row4 combined. Let's check.\n\nExample0's output row0 is [4,4,5,0]. Input rows0 and4:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0]\nRow4: [0,0,6,0,0,0,9,0]\n\nCombined, how? Maybe take the first two non-zero from row0 (4,4), then the first non-zero from row4 (6) and row0's 5. But output is [4,4,5,0]. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is the sum of the corresponding cell in the upper and lower halves. For example, upper half rows0-3 and lower half rows4-7. Each cell in the output is the sum of row[i] and row[i+4] for each column. Let's see for Example0:\n\nOutput row0 would be row0 + row4:\n\n4+0=4, 4+0=4, 0+6=6, 0+0=0, 0+0=0, 0+0=0,5+9=14,0+0=0. Then how does this become [4,4,5,0]? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by concatenating the non-zero elements of each pair of rows (upper and lower) and taking the first four. For example, row0 and row4:\n\nRow0 non-zeros:4,4,5\nRow4 non-zeros:6,9\nCombined:4,4,5,6,9. Take first four:4,4,5,6. But the output is [4,4,5,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another approach by looking at multiple examples.\n\nTake Example3's input:\n\nInput rows0-3:\nRow0: [4,0,0,4,0,5,0,5]\nRow1: [0,0,4,0,5,0,0,5]\nRow2: [0,0,4,4,0,0,5,5]\nRow3: [4,0,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nRows4-7:\nRow4: [6,6,6,0,9,0,9,9]\nRow5: [6,6,6,0,0,9,9,9]\nRow6: [6,0,0,6,9,9,0,9]\nRow7: [6,6,0,6,9,0,9,9]\n\nOutput:\n[6,5,6,5]\n[5,6,6,5]\n[6,9,5,5]\n[5,6,9,5]\n\nFor example, output row0: [6,5,6,5]. Let's see if this comes from combining row0 and row4. Row0 has non-zeros 4,4,5,5. Row4 has 6,6,6,9,9,9. Combining them gives 4,4,5,5,6,6,6,9,9,9. Take first four non-zero:4,4,5,5. But output is 6,5,6,5. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is formed by taking certain elements from the input in a spiral order or some other pattern. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output cell corresponds to a 2x2 block in the input, and the value is the sum of non-zero elements in that block. For example, for Example0:\n\nInput is 8x8. Each 2x2 block would give an output cell. 8/2=4, so 4x4 output. Let's check.\n\nFirst 2x2 block in Example0's input (rows0-1, cols0-1):\n\nRow0:4,4\nRow1:4,4\nSum of non-zero:4+4+4+4=16. Output's first cell is4. So maybe take the maximum. Max here is4. Which matches the first element of the output.\n\nNext block (rows0-1, cols2-3):\n\nRow0:0,0\nRow1:0,0\nMax is0. But the first output row's second element is4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Alternative: For each 2x2 block, if there are non-zero elements, take the maximum. Otherwise, take the sum. Not sure.\n\nLet me try this for Example0's first block:\n\nFirst block (rows0-1, cols0-1): max is4. Output's first element is4. Correct.\nSecond block (cols2-3, rows0-1): all zeros. Output's second element is4. Doesn't match. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother angle: The output numbers are combinations of the numbers present in the input. For example, in Example0's output, the first row is 4,4,5,0. The numbers 4 and5 are from the first few input rows, and 0. The second row is 6,6,6,9, which are from the latter rows. So perhaps each output row is formed by combining a row from the first half (rows0-3) and a row from the second half (rows4-7), and taking certain elements from each.\n\nFor example, output row0 is formed by combining row0 (first half) and row4 (second half). Let's see:\n\nRow0: [4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0]\nRow4: [0,0,6,0,0,0,9,0]\n\nIf we take elements from row0 and row4 in some way. For example, take the first two non-zero from row0 (4,4), then the first two non-zero from row4 (6,9). But output row0 is [4,4,5,0]. Hmm, not matching. Or take the non-zero elements from row0 and row4:4,4,5,6,9. Take first four:4,4,5,6. But output is4,4,5,0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first two elements from the first row of the pair and the last two elements from the second row of the pair. For example, Example0's first output row comes from rows0 and1:\n\nRow0's first two:4,4 \u2192 output first two elements\nRow1's last two elements:0,0 \u2192 output last two elements. But output is [4,4,5,0]. So row0's sixth element is5, which is position6. Maybe taking first two from row0 and sixth and seventh from row1.\n\nRow0's first two:4,4\nRow1's sixth and seventh:0,0 \u2192 output would be [4,4,0,0]. But actual output is4,4,5,0. So this is incorrect.\n\nAnother observation: In the output rows, sometimes the numbers are from different parts of the input. For example, Example0's output row3 is [5,5,6,0]. The 5s could come from earlier rows, and 6 from later.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Let's try to look for another pattern. Let's take the test input and see if we can find a pattern that applies.\n\nTest Input:\n[0,4,0,4,5,0,0,0]\n[0,4,4,4,5,0,5,5]\n[4,4,4,0,0,5,5,5]\n[0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n[6,0,6,6,9,9,9,0]\n[0,0,0,6,0,9,0,0]\n[0,6,0,0,0,0,9,9]\n[6,0,0,0,0,9,0,0]\n\nEach of these rows is part of the input. The output needs to be a 4x4 grid. Let's imagine that each output row is formed by two input rows. Let's pair the input rows as follows:\n\nRow0 and row1 \u2192 output row0\n\nRow2 and row3 \u2192 output row1\n\nRow4 and row5 \u2192 output row2\n\nRow6 and row7 \u2192 output row3\n\nNow, let's see what each pair could contribute.\n\nFor output row0: from rows0 and1.\n\nRow0: [0,4,0,4,5,0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,4,4,4,5,0,5,5]\n\nLooking for non-zero elements:\n\nRow0:4,4,5\n\nRow1:4,4,4,5,5,5\n\nCombined non-zero:4,4,5,4,4,4,5,5,5. Take first four:4,4,5,4. But what's the output? Maybe the output row0 would have 5,5,0,6 based on training examples' patterns, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's look for a pattern where each output element is formed by taking the first non-zero element from each pair of columns in the two rows.\n\nFor example, in pair rows0 and1:\n\nColumns 0-1:\n\nRow0:0,4\n\nRow1:0,4\n\nTake the non-zero from these:4 (row0's column1) and4 (row1's column1). But how to combine into output elements.\n\nAlternatively, for each column pair, sum the non-zero elements. For columns0-1:\n\n0 +0=0, but both rows have 4 in column1. So sum would be4+4=8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, take the maximum. For columns0-1, max is4. Then columns2-3: row0 has0,4; row1 has4,4. Max is4. Then columns4-5:5,0 and5,0 \u2192 max5. Columns6-7:0,0 and5,5 \u2192 max5. So output row would be [4,4,5,5]. But how does this match the expected output? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the sum of each pair of columns from the two rows. For example, for columns0-1, sum from row0 and row1:\n\n0+0=0, 4+4=8 \u2192 sum is 0+8=8. But this seems unlikely.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe each output row is formed by taking the first four non-zero elements from the combination of the two input rows, ordered from left to right. For rows0 and1:\n\nRow0's non-zeros:4 (pos1),4 (pos3),5 (pos4)\nRow1's non-zeros:4 (pos1),4 (pos2),4 (pos3),5 (pos4),5 (pos6),5 (pos7)\nCombined in order left to right:\n\nLooking at the earliest positions:\n\npos0: row0 is0, row1 is0 \u2192 skip.\npos1: row0 is4, row1 is4 \u2192 take 4 from row0 first, then 4 from row1.\npos2: row0 is0, row1 is4 \u2192 take4.\npos3: row0 is4, row1 is4 \u2192 take4 from row0, then4 from row1.\npos4: row0 is5, row1 is5 \u2192 take5 from row0, then5 from row1.\n...\n\nBut combining all non-zero elements in order of their positions would be:\n\nrow0's 4 (pos1), 4 (pos3),5 (pos4)\n\nrow1's 4 (pos1),4 (pos2),4 (pos3),5 (pos4),5 (pos6),5 (pos7)\n\nCombined in order of appearance:\n\npos1 (row0:4), pos1 (row1:4), pos2 (row1:4), pos3 (row0:4), pos3 (row1:4), pos4 (row0:5), pos4 (row1:5), pos6 (row1:5), pos7 (row1:5).\n\nTake first four:4,4,4,4. But output would need to have four elements. However, in the training examples, the outputs have varying numbers. For example, Example0's output row0 is [4,4,5,0]. So this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output elements are the sum of the non-zero elements in each quadrant of the input. For example, the input is divided into four 4x4 quadrants. Each quadrant's non-zero sum is an output element. But in Example0, the input's first quadrant (rows0-3, cols0-3) has several 4s. Summing non-zero elements: row0 has 4,4 \u2192 sum 8. row1 has4,4 \u2192 sum8. row2 has4 \u2192 sum4. row3 has4 \u2192 sum4. Total sum is8+8+4+4=24. But output row0 is [4,4,5,0], so this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to see if there's a pattern involving the count of numbers. For example, the output could be the count of a certain number in each quadrant. But not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Looking at the test input and trying to derive the output based on previous examples. For example, in the test input, the first two rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,4,0,4,5,0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,4,4,4,5,0,5,5]\n\nPossible output row0: looking for non-zero elements. Row0 has 4,4,5. Row1 has4,4,4,5,5,5. Combining these, but how to get four elements. Maybe the first four non-zero elements from the combined rows:4,4,5,4. But output needs to have four elements. However, looking at the training examples, sometimes the output includes zeros. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the first two non-zero from each row, and if there aren't enough, pad with zeros. For example, row0's first two non-zero:4 (pos1),4 (pos3). Row1's first two non-zero:4 (pos1),4 (pos2). Combining gives4,4,4,4. But the output in Example0's first row was [4,4,5,0], which includes a 5 from row0's fifth position. So this approach isn't consistent.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0's output, the numbers 4,4,5,0 are in the first row. The first input row has 4,4, and 5. The second row has 4,4. So maybe the output row is formed by taking the first three non-zero from row0 and the first non-zero from row1. But row0 has three non-zero elements, row1 has two. So output would be4,4,5,4. But the actual output is4,4,5,0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, take the first three non-zero from row0 and the last non-zero from row1. Row0's first three:4,4,5. Row1's last non-zero:4 (if row1's non-zero are4,4). But output is4,4,5,0. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe the output rows are formed by taking the diagonal elements of the input rows. For example, each output row is formed by taking elements from the diagonal of the input's 8x8 grid. But this would give 8 elements, not 4.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is formed by taking elements from even and odd positions. For example, take even indices from the first row and odd indices from the second row. But not sure.\n\nLet me try to look for a pattern in the numbers. For example, in Example0's output:\n\nRow0:4,4,5,0\n\nRow1:6,6,6,9\n\nRow2:6,9,5,6\n\nRow3:5,5,6,0\n\nThe numbers 4,5,6,9 are the same as in the input. Maybe the output is a combination of these numbers from different regions. For example, the first two rows of the input (4s and5s) contribute to the first two output rows, and the next two rows (6s and9s) contribute to the last two output rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, each output cell is the product of certain elements in the input. But this seems unlikely.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output row3: [5,5,6,0]. The input rows6 and7 are:\n\nRow6:6,0,6,6,9,9,0,0\n\nRow7:0,6,6,0,9,0,0,0\n\nNon-zero elements in row6:6,6,6,9,9.\n\nNon-zero in row7:6,6,9.\n\nCombined non-zero:6,6,6,9,9,6,6,9. Take first four:6,6,6,9. But output row3 is [5,5,6,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nPerhaps the output is formed by some other rule. Another Idea: The output rows are the result of XOR operations between corresponding elements of the two input rows. For example, for each pair of rows, take XOR of elements. But Example0's row0 and row1:\n\nRow0:4,4,0,0,0,0,5,0\n\nRow1:4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nXOR would be 0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0. Then take first four and last four elements: [0,0,0,0], [0,0,5,0]. Output row0 is [4,4,5,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother Idea: The output is formed by concatenating the first two elements of the first row, then the first two elements of the second row, and so on. But this doesn't align with the examples.\n\nPerhaps the key is to look at the positions of the numbers in the input and how they map to the output. For example, in Example0's output row0, the 4s come from the beginning of the input rows, and the5 comes from later in the first row.\n\nAlternatively, each output row is formed by taking the first non-zero element from each of the two input rows, then the second non-zero, etc. For example, for rows0 and1:\n\nRow0's non-zero:4,4,5\n\nRow1's non-zero:4,4\n\nCombined:4 (row0),4 (row1),4 (row0),4 (row1),5 (row0). Take first four:4,4,4,4. Not matching the output.\n\nAfter trying numerous approaches and not finding a clear pattern, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Looking at the test input and the training examples, I notice that in the output, numbers like 5, 9, 6, and 4 are common, which correspond to the non-zero numbers in the input. The outputs seem to combine elements from both the upper and lower halves of the input.\n\nFor the test input, the first four rows have a lot of 4s and5s, and the lower four rows have 6s and9s. Perhaps the output is formed by combining elements from these halves. For example, each output row is a combination of a row from the upper half and a row from the lower half, taking certain elements.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first non-zero element from each pair of rows. For example, for the first two input rows (row0 and row1):\n\nRow0: [0,4,0,4,5,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zeros:4 (pos1),4 (pos3),5 (pos4)\nRow1: [0,4,4,4,5,0,5,5] \u2192 non-zeros:4 (pos1),4 (pos2),4 (pos3),5 (pos4),5 (pos6),5 (pos7)\n\nCombined non-zero elements in order of appearance:\n\n4 (row0 pos1),4 (row0 pos3),5 (row0 pos4),4 (row1 pos1),4 (row1 pos2),4 (row1 pos3),5 (row1 pos4),5 (row1 pos6),5 (row1 pos7)\n\nTake the first four non-zero elements:4,4,5,4. But the output needs four elements, so maybe this would be [4,4,5,4]. However, looking at the training examples, the outputs sometimes have zeros. So maybe after combining, if there are fewer than four non-zero elements, pad with zeros. For example, if a pair of rows has only three non-zero elements in total, the fourth element would be zero.\n\nBut this is speculative. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach for the test input. Let's try generating the output.\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,4,0,4,5,0,0,0] \u2192 non-zeros:4,4,5\nRow1: [0,4,4,4,5,0,5,5] \u2192 non-zeros:4,4,4,5,5,5\nCombined non-zeros:4 (row0),4 (row0),5 (row0),4 (row1),4 (row1),4 (row1),5 (row1),5 (row1),5 (row1)\nTake first four:4,4,5,4. So output row0 would be [4,4,5,4], but in the training examples, the output sometimes has zeros. Alternatively, maybe it's taking first two from row0 and first two from row1. Row0's first two non-zero:4,4. Row1's first two:4,4. So output row0: [4,4,4,4], but this doesn't match any training example pattern.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair of rows, take the first non-zero element from row0, then row1, then row0, etc., until four elements are taken. For row0 and row1:\n\nRow0 non-zeros:4 (pos1),4 (pos3),5 (pos4)\nRow1 non-zeros:4 (pos1),4 (pos2),4 (pos3),5 (pos4),5 (pos6),5 (pos7)\n\nAlternating:\n\nrow0's 4 (pos1), row1's4 (pos1) \u21924,4\n\nrow0's4 (pos3), row1's4 (pos2) \u21924,4\n\nNow we have four elements:4,4,4,4. But output needs four elements. This doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is formed by taking the first non-zero element from each pair of columns in the two rows. For example, for columns 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7:\n\nFor row0 and row1:\n\ncolumns0-1: row0 [0,4], row1 [0,4] \u2192 non-zero:4,4 \u2192 take the first non-zero (4)\n\ncolumns2-3: row0 [0,4], row1 [4,4] \u2192 non-zero:4,4 \u2192 take 4\n\ncolumns4-5: row0 [5,0], row1 [5,0] \u2192 non-zero:5,5 \u2192 take5\n\ncolumns6-7: row0 [0,0], row1 [5,5] \u2192 non-zero:5 \u2192 take5\n\nSo output row0 would be [4,4,5,5]. But looking at training examples, this might not align. However, let's see for Example0:\n\nRow0 and row1:\n\ncolumns0-1:4,4 \u2192 take4\n\ncolumns2-3:0,0 \u2192 take0\n\ncolumns4-5:0,0 \u2192 take0\n\ncolumns6-7:5,0 \u2192 take5\n\nSo output would be [4,0,0,5], which doesn't match Example0's output [4,4,5,0]. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAfter trying many possibilities without success, I'll have to make an educated guess. Looking at the examples, the outputs often include the non-zero numbers from the input, possibly in the order they appear, but grouped differently. For the test input, I'll assume that each output row is formed by taking the non-zero elements from two input rows and combining them, then taking the first four elements. For example:\n\nTest input rows0 and1:\n\nNon-zeros:4,4,5 (row0) +4,4,4,5,5,5 (row1) \u2192 combined:4,4,5,4,4,4,5,5,5 \u2192 first four:4,4,5,4 \u2192 but the output requires four elements, perhaps this would be [4,4,5,4]. However, looking at Example0's first output row, which has [4,4,5,0], the fourth element is 0, which might be from row1's sixth position (0). So maybe the pattern involves specific positions. For example, taking elements from positions 1,3,4,6 of the two rows.\n\nFor row0 and row1:\n\nrow0: positions1=4,3=4,4=5,6=0\n\nrow1: positions1=4,3=4,4=5,6=5\n\nSo combining row0's elements and row1's elements: perhaps take row0's1,3,4, row1's6 \u21924,4,5,5 \u2192 output row0: [4,4,5,5]. But this doesn't match the training examples.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the test input and the examples. The test input's first two rows have many 4s and5s. The lower rows have 6s and9s. The output might combine these. Looking at Example0's output, which combines 4,4,5 and 6,6,6,9, I'll guess the test output might start with 5,5,9,5 or similar. But this is a wild guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input's first four rows, which have many 5s and 4s, and the lower four rows have 6s and9s. The output might be:\n\nFirst output row: 5,5,5,9\n\nSecond output row:5,5,9,9\n\nThird:6,9,5,5\n\nFourth:9,9,0,0\n\nBut this is purely speculative. However, given the format of the training examples, the output usually has four rows of four elements each. The test output should follow the same pattern.\n\nAfter careful consideration and trying various patterns, I think the correct approach is to combine the non-zero elements from pairs of input rows and take the first four, padding with zeros if needed. For the test input:\n\nPair rows0 and1:\n\nNon-zeros:4,4,5 (row0) +4,4,4,5,5,5 (row1). Combined:4,4,5,4,4,4,5,5,5. First four:4,4,5,4 \u2192 output row0: [4,4,5,4]\n\nPair rows2 and3:\n\nRow2:4,4,4,5,5,5\n\nRow3:5 \u2192 combined:4,4,4,5,5,5,5. First four:4,4,4,5 \u2192 output row1: [4,4,4,5]\n\nPair rows4 and5:\n\nRow4:6,6,9,9,9\n\nRow5:6,9 \u2192 combined:6,6,9,9,9,6,9. First four:6,6,9,9 \u2192 output row2: [6,6,9,9]\n\nPair rows6 and7:\n\nRow6:6,9,9\n\nRow7:6,9 \u2192 combined:6,9,9,6,9. First four:6,9,9,6 \u2192 output row3: [6,9,9,6]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' format, which often have varying numbers and zeros. Therefore, this approach is likely incorrect. \n\nAnother possibility is that each output row is formed by taking elements from the two input rows' positions 1,3,5,7 (odd indices). For test input rows0 and1:\n\nRow0: positions1=4,3=4,5=0,7=0 \u2192 4,4,0,0\n\nRow1: positions1=4,3=4,5=0,7=5 \u21924,4,0,5\n\nCombined:4,4,4,4,0,0,0,5. Take first four:4,4,4,4. Output row0: [4,4,4,4]. Doesn't match training examples.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the training examples, the output seems to combine elements from both the upper and lower parts of the input. For the test input, the output might be:\n\n[5,5,9,5]\n\n[6,9,5,5]\n\n[5,6,9,0]\n\n[6,0,9,0]\n\nBut without a clear pattern, this is speculative. However, I'll proceed to format the answer according to the training examples.",
