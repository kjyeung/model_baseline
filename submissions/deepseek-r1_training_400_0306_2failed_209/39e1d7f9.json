        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. The task is to look at the training examples and find out how the input is transformed into the output, then apply that to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the input and output arrays seem similar at first glance. But when I look closer, some elements are changed. For instance, in the input, the last few lines have 6s, but in the output, those 6s are replaced with 3s, and there are new 6s added elsewhere. Wait, let me check the exact positions.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the lines near the bottom (like the 20th to 23rd rows) have [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,6,6,6,6,8,0,0,0,0]. The output for those rows becomes [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,3,3,3,3,8,6,6,6,6,8,3,3,3,3]. So the 0s after the 8 are replaced with 3s, and the ending 0s are replaced with 3s. Also, in the output, the 0s in the middle of the line (positions 10-13) turn into 3s. So it looks like there's a pattern where certain 0s are replaced with another number based on their position relative to other elements, maybe adjacent to 8s.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has some 4s at the end of the first few rows. In the output, those 4s are still there, but the elements before them change. For example, the first three input rows end with 4,4,4. In the output, the elements before that (positions 20-22) change from 0s to 6s. So like the input line [0,0,0,3,0,...,4,4,4] becomes [0,0,0,3,...,6,6,6,3,4,4,4]. So it's adding 6s where there were 0s, adjacent to the 3s and 4s. Also, in other parts of the example, like the 8th row, the input has 6s and 4s, and the output changes some 0s to 6s or 4s. Maybe it's propagating values in certain directions when surrounded by certain numbers.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 2s at the end of the first rows, and in the output, those 2s remain, but the preceding 0s are replaced with 4s. For instance, the first input line ends with 2,2,2, and the output starts with 4,4,4,8,... and ends with 2,2,2. The 0s before the 8s are replaced with 4s. So again, certain 0s are being replaced by numbers that are adjacent or part of a structure.\n\nPutting this together, it seems like the pattern involves replacing 0s with a certain number based on their position relative to other numbers. Specifically, maybe the 0s that are adjacent to a number (like 3, 4, 6, 8) in certain directions (like left, right, up, down) get replaced by another number. Alternatively, it could be that the 0s in specific positions (like every fourth element) are replaced by a value that's present in adjacent blocks.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the lines that are all 8s or 3s or other numbers remain unchanged. The transformation happens in the lines that have 0s. For example, in Example 0, the lines with 8s in the middle (like the 4th row) are unchanged. The lines that have 0s and 8s are the ones that get modified. So the key is to look at the 0s in the input and replace them with another number based on their context.\n\nLooking at the test input now. The test input has lines with 4s and 0s. For example, the first few lines are [0,0,4,...], then a line of all 4s. Then there are lines with 6s and 8s and 3s. Following the pattern from the examples, perhaps the 0s adjacent to 4s or other numbers are replaced with a specific value.\n\nIn the test input, let's look at a line like [0,0,4,0,0,4,...]. In the output, perhaps the 0s before the 4s would be replaced with another number. Let's check the training examples again. In Example 1, the 0s before 3s and 4s turned into 6s. In Example 2, 0s turned into 4s near 8s. So maybe the replacement depends on the neighboring numbers. For example, if a 0 is next to a 4, it might be replaced with a 6 or another number based on some rule.\n\nWait, in the test input, there are 4s and 8s and 3s and 6s. For instance, in the 7th row of the test input: [0,0,4,0,0,4,8,8,4,3,3,4,8,8,4,...]. The 0s here might be replaced based on adjacent numbers. For example, the 0s next to 8s could become 3s or something else.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the training examples, the output seems to \"extend\" certain patterns. For instance, in Example 0's output, the 3s that were present in the input are extended further into the 0s. Similarly, in Example 1, the 6s in certain positions are extended. So maybe the rule is that when there's a block of a certain number (like 3,6, etc.), the adjacent 0s are filled with the next number in a sequence. Or perhaps it's mirroring or shifting patterns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the structure of the input and output arrays, they might represent grids (like images) where certain regions are filled. For example, the 8s could form a grid structure, and the 3s and 6s are filling areas within the grid. The transformation might be filling in certain quadrants or regions with the next number in a cycle. For instance, 3 becomes 6, 6 becomes something else, etc.\n\nAnother thought: The numbers might represent colors or layers, and the transformation is shifting or rotating parts of the image. For example, in Example 0, the 6s in the input are replaced with 3s in the output in certain rows, which could indicate a rotation or shift of a block.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the lines with 3s and 6s are transformed such that the 6s in the middle part (like rows 5-8) remain, but in the lower rows (rows 20-23), the 6s in positions 15-18 (assuming 0-based index) are present, and the 0s after them become 3s. So maybe the 0s that are in certain positions relative to the 8s and other numbers are replaced with the previous number from another part of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that in the input, whenever there's a sequence like [8, x, x, x, x, 8], the 0s between the 8s are filled with a certain number. But that might not hold across all examples.\n\nLooking at the test input, there's a line with [6,6,4,0,0,4,...]. Maybe the 0s next to the 4 would be replaced with 6s. But I'm not sure. Let me try to find a pattern that applies to all training examples.\n\nLet me take Example 1's input and output. In the first input row, the last three elements are 4,4,4. In the output, the elements before them (positions 20-23) change from 0,0,0,3 to 6,6,6,3. So the 0s are replaced with 6s. The 3s are still there. So maybe when there's a block of 4s at the end, the preceding 0s are replaced with 6s. Similarly, in Example 2, the 0s before the 2s (which are at the end) are replaced with 4s.\n\nSo the pattern could be that the 0s in certain positions (like the penultimate block before the end block) are replaced with the number that's present in another part of the row. For example, if a row ends with a block of Xs, the preceding 0s are replaced with Ys, where Y is determined by some rule.\n\nAlternatively, it's a shift. Like the last block of numbers in the input is shifted to the left, and the previous block is filled with another number. For instance, in Example 1's first input row, the end is 4,4,4. In the output, the last elements are still 4,4,4, but the preceding 0s are replaced with 6,6,6. So maybe the 6s come from a previous block in the same row. Looking at the input row, there are 6s in the middle (positions 8-10: 6,6,6). Maybe those 6s are copied to the end. But in the output, the 6s are inserted before the 4s. So perhaps it's a matter of propagating values from the middle to the end.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is divided into segments separated by 8s (or another number), and each segment's 0s are replaced with the number from the next segment. For example, in Example 0, each row has segments separated by 8s. The 0s in a segment are replaced with the number from the next segment. Like in the first input row of Example 0, the segments are 0s, 3s, 0s, 0s. The output replaces some 0s with 3s from the next segment.\n\nThis might make sense. Let's check. In Example 0's first input row: [0,0,0,0,8,3,3,3,3,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]. The output is the same except for the last segment. Wait, no\u2014 the output's first few rows are the same as the input. But in the later rows of the input (like row 20), the 0s after the 8s become 3s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern involves mirroring or flipping parts of the array. For example, taking a segment and mirroring it to another part. But that's a bit vague.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input and output, the main difference is in rows 15-18 and 20-23. In the input, row 15 is [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0], and in the output, the last part becomes [8,3,3,3,3,8]. Wait, maybe not. Let me check the exact indices. Oh, in the output, the last part of row 15 becomes 8,3,3,3,3,8 instead of 8,0,0,0,0,8. So the 0s between the 8s are replaced with 3s. Similarly, in row 20 of the input, the 0s after the 8s are replaced with 3s. So whenever there's an 8 followed by 0s and then another 8, the 0s are filled with a certain number. But in Example 0's input, some segments between 8s have 3s, others have 0s. The output seems to fill the 0s in those segments with 3s. But why 3s?\n\nWait, looking at the input's rows 5-8: those have segments with 6s between 8s. So maybe the pattern is that the numbers between 8s are filled with the next number in a sequence. For example, 3 comes after 6 or vice versa. But in Example 0's output, the segments that were 0s become 3s, but the segments with 6s remain. So perhaps the 0s between 8s are replaced with the previous number used in that row or a default number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 0s that are in regions bounded by the same number (like 8s) are replaced with the number from the adjacent segment. For example, if a segment between 8s has 0s, replace them with the number from the next or previous segment. In Example 0's first row, the segments are 0s, 3s, 0s, 0s. The output's first row remains the same, but in later rows, like row 15, the 0s are replaced with 3s. So maybe it's propagating the 3s from earlier segments into the later segments.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to look for another approach. Maybe the transformation is cyclic. For instance, each number is incremented by a certain value, but 0s are replaced based on their neighbors. But in the examples, the numbers don't seem to be simply incremented.\n\nAnother observation: In all the examples, the output has the same structure as the input but with some 0s replaced by other numbers. The key is to figure out which 0s are replaced and with what.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 0: ends with 4,4,4. Output row 0: ends with 4,4,4, but before that, the 0,0,0,3 becomes 6,6,6,3. So the 0s are replaced with 6s. Where do the 6s come from? In the input's row 4-6, there are 6s. Maybe the 6s from those rows are being propagated to other parts of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that for every row that ends with a certain number (like 4 in Example 1), the preceding 0s are replaced with the next number in the sequence. For example, 3 \u2192 6, 6 \u2192 4, etc. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a matter of rotating or shifting the numbers. For example, in Example 0's input, the 3s and 6s are in certain positions, and the output shifts them to other positions, replacing the 0s.\n\nBut I need a more concrete pattern. Let me take another approach. Let's consider the positions of the 0s that are changed in the examples.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 0s in the last few rows (20-23) in positions 10-13 and 20-23 are replaced with 3s. Looking at the input's row 20: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,6,6,6,6,8,0,0,0,0]. The output row becomes [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,3,3,3,3,8,6,6,6,6,8,3,3,3,3]. So between the 8s at positions 4 and 9 (assuming 0-based), the 0s (positions 5-8) remain 0s, but between the 8s at positions 9 and 14, the 0s (positions 10-13) become 3s. Similarly, after the 8 at position 14, the next 8 is at position 19, and the 0s in between (15-18) become 6s. Then, after the 8 at 19, the 0s from 20-23 become 3s. Wait, but in the input, the 15-18 positions are 6s, which are retained in the output. The 10-13 0s become 3s, and the 20-23 0s become 3s. So the pattern here might be that between certain 8s, the 0s are replaced with a specific number. For example, in the segment after the second 8 in the row (positions 9-14), the 0s become 3s, and after the fourth 8, the 0s become 3s again. But why 3s here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each segment between 8s is filled with a certain number, and the 0s are replaced with that number. In the input, some segments have 3s or 6s, and others have 0s. The output fills the 0 segments with the number from the previous segment. For example, in row 20 of the input, the segments are 0s (after the first 8), then 0s, then 6s, then 0s. In the output, the first segment (after the first 8) remains 0s, the next segment (after the second 8) becomes 3s, then 6s, then 3s. So maybe the number used to fill the 0s is the number from the previous non-zero segment. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The numbers could represent layers, and the transformation is revealing a lower layer. For example, 0s are transparent and show the layer below. But in the examples, this doesn't directly apply.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern involves XOR-ing the numbers with a certain value, but that's unlikely given the examples.\n\nLet's think of the numbers as colors in a grid. The input might represent a certain figure, and the output is a modified version where certain regions are filled with a different color. For instance, in Example 0, the 3s and 6s form a pattern that's extended in the output.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is a rotation of the grid. For example, rotating 90 degrees, but the output rows have the same length as the input, so it's not rotation.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that in each row, certain positions (like every fourth element) are replaced with a specific number. Looking at Example 0's output, the positions where 0s are replaced are at certain intervals. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a mathematical relationship between the input and output numbers. For instance, in Example 1, the input has 3s and 6s, and the output has 6s where there were 0s. Maybe 3*2=6. Similarly, in Example 0, 3s and 6s are involved. But in Example 2, the numbers are 2,4,8. 2*2=4, 4*2=8. So perhaps each 0 is replaced with the next number in a doubling sequence based on adjacent numbers. For example, a 0 next to a 3 becomes 6 (3*2), a 0 next to a 6 becomes 12 (but that's not present), but this may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, each 0 is replaced with the sum of adjacent numbers. But looking at Example 0, row 20 in the input has 0s next to 8s. 8+8=16, which is not present, so that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, each 0 is replaced with the number that is one less than the adjacent number. For example, next to 8, it's 7, but that's not present.\n\nHmm. Let's try to find a different pattern. In all three examples, the output changes some 0s into other numbers, while keeping the non-zero numbers the same. The key is to determine which 0s are changed and what they're changed into.\n\nLooking at Example 1's first input row: the output changes the last three 0s before the 4s into 6s. In the input, those 0s are preceded by 3s. So maybe when a 0 is preceded by a 3 and followed by a 4, it becomes a 6. Or perhaps the 6 is derived from the 3 and 4. 3+4=7, not 6. 3*2=6. Maybe doubling the preceding number.\n\nIn Example 1's output row 0: ...0,3,0,0,0,3,4,4,4 becomes ...6,6,6,3,4,4,4. The 0s after the 3 and before the 4 are replaced with 6s. So if a 0 is between a 3 and a 4, it becomes 6. Similarly, in Example 2's output, 0s between 8s and 2s become 4s. 8 and 2: 8/2=4. Or 8-2=6, but no. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number replacing the 0 is the average of the surrounding numbers. For example, between 3 and 4: (3+4)/2=3.5, which rounds to 3 or 4, but in the example, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: The examples might be showing a cellular automaton-like rule where 0s are updated based on their neighbors. For example, if a 0 has a certain number to its left or right, it becomes that number. Or if surrounded by certain numbers.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 20: the 0s after the 8 at position 14 are followed by 6s. In the output, those 0s become 3s. So maybe the rule is that if a 0 is between an 8 and a 6, it becomes a 3. But that's not consistent across examples.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers form a cycle: 3 \u2192 6 \u2192 4 \u2192 8 \u2192 3. When a 0 is adjacent to a number, it becomes the next in the cycle. For example, 3's next is 6, so 0 next to 3 becomes 6. 6's next is 4, so 0 next to 6 becomes 4. 4's next is 8, etc. Let's test this against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's first row, the 0s before the 4s are replaced with 6s. If those 0s are next to 3s (which they are), then according to the cycle, 3's next is 6. So that fits. In Example 0, the 0s near 6s (in row 20) would become 4s, but in the output they become 3s. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the cycle could be 3 \u2192 6 \u2192 3 \u2192 6... So 0s next to 3 become 6, and next to 6 become 3. That could explain Example 0's row 20, where 0s near 6s become 3s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input row 20: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,6,6,6,6,8,0,0,0,0]. The output changes the 0s after the 8 at position 14 (which is followed by 6s) to 3s. So the 0s adjacent to 6s become 3s. If the cycle is 3 \u2194 6, then yes. Also, in Example 1's output, 0s next to 3s become 6s. That fits. So this could be the pattern: replace 0s with the next number in the cycle when adjacent to a certain number.\n\nIn Example 2's output, the 0s before the 2s are replaced with 4s. If the cycle is 2 \u21924 \u21928 \u21922..., then 0s next to 2s become 4s. That fits. Also, in Example 2's input row 0 ends with 2,2,2. The output replaces preceding 0s with 4,4,4. So if a 0 is near a 2, it becomes 4. If near a 4, becomes 8, etc.\n\nIn the test input, there are 4s, 6s, 8s, and 3s. For example, in the test input's line 4: [0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,6,6,4,0,0,4,0,0]. The 0s next to 4s would become 8s according to the cycle (4's next is 8). But looking at the examples, perhaps the cycle is 3\u21926\u21924\u21928\u21923. So each number is followed by another, and 0s next to a number are replaced with the next in the cycle.\n\nLet's verify:\n\nExample 1 has 3s and 4s. 3's next is 6, 6's next is 4. So 0s next to 3 become 6, 0s next to 4 become 8, etc. But in Example 1's output, the 0s before the 4s became 6s, which would be next in the cycle after 3, not 4. Hmm, maybe the cycle is different.\n\nAlternatively, the cycle is 3\u21926\u21923\u21926, and 4\u21928\u21924\u21928, and 2\u21924\u21922\u21924. Then, 0s next to a number become the next in that number's cycle.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 0s before the 4s are next to 3s, which cycle to 6. So that fits.\n\nIn Example 2's input, the 0s before the 2s are replaced with 4s (2's next is 4), and the 0s near 4s become 8s. But in the test input, there's a line with 6s next to 4s. According to this, 4's next is 8. So 0s next to 4s would become 8s.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's take the first few lines of the test input:\n\nFirst line: [0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0]\n\nEach 0 is adjacent to a 4. According to the cycle, 4's next is 8, so these 0s should become 8s. But looking at Example 2, the 0s before 2s became 4s (2's next), so the pattern holds. So replacing 0s next to a number X with the next number in the cycle of X.\n\nBut let's check the test input's line 3: [0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,6,6,4,0,0,4,0,0]. The 0s next to 4 would become 8s, and the 0s next to 6 would become 3s (if the cycle is 6\u21923). So the line would change to [8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,...6,6,4,3,3,4,...]. But looking at the training examples, how is the replacement done? For example, in Example 0, the 0s next to 8s remain 0s. So maybe 8 doesn't have a next number in the cycle. Or the cycle only applies to certain numbers.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 0s next to 8s are not replaced. So maybe the cycle is only for numbers like 3,6,4,2. 8 is a separator and doesn't cycle. So the rule is: if a 0 is adjacent to a number X (not 8), replace it with the next number in X's cycle. The cycle could be 3\u21926\u21924\u21928\u21923, but in Example 2, 2\u21924\u21928\u21922.\n\nAlternatively, the cycle is 3\u21926\u21923, 4\u21928\u21924, 2\u21924\u21922, 6\u21923\u21926. So each number cycles between two values.\n\nSo, applying this to the test input:\n\n- 0s adjacent to 4 \u2192 become 8 (since 4 cycles to 8)\n- 0s adjacent to 6 \u2192 become 3 (6 cycles to 3)\n- 0s adjacent to 3 \u2192 become 6 (3 cycles to 6)\n- 0s adjacent to 8 remain 0\n\nBut in the test input, there are lines with 8s and 3s. For example, line 6 of the test input: [0,0,4,0,0,4,8,8,4,3,3,4,8,8,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0]. The 0s adjacent to 8 would remain 0. The 0s adjacent to 4 would become 8, and adjacent to 3 would become 6.\n\nSo in the output for this line, the 0s next to 4s would turn into 8s. For example, the first few elements [0,0,4] would become [8,8,4], then next [0,0,4] becomes [8,8,4], etc. The 0s next to 8s (like between 8 and 4) would remain 0. The 0s next to 3s would become 6s. So the part [3,3,4] would have 0s next to 3s replaced with 6s.\n\nBut looking at the test input's line 6, let's look at the elements:\n\nThe line is: [0,0,4,0,0,4,8,8,4,3,3,4,8,8,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0]\n\nAfter replacement:\n\nThe first two 0s are adjacent to 4 (the third element is 4), so they become 8. Then next two 0s are adjacent to 4 (the sixth element is 4), so they become 8. Then we have 8,8,4. The 8s are separators, so the 0s after them would depend on neighboring numbers. For example, after 8,8,4, the next 0s are adjacent to 4, so they become 8. Then we have 3,3,4. The 0s adjacent to 3 would become 6. Then 8,8,4, and so on.\n\nSo the output line would look like [8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,6,6,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8].\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's check if this fits the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0's row 20 input: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,6,6,6,6,8,0,0,0,0]. The 0s after the first 8 are not adjacent to any number except 8, so they remain 0. The 0s after the second 8 (positions 10-13) are adjacent to the 6s that are further ahead (positions 15-18). Wait, no. The 0s at positions 10-13 are between two 8s. If there's a 6 later in the row, but not adjacent, the rule might not apply. So maybe the replacement only happens when the 0 is directly adjacent (left or right) to a non-8 number.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is based on the nearest non-8 number in that segment. For example, between two 8s, if there's a number, the 0s are replaced with the next in the cycle. If the segment is all 0s, maybe they are replaced with the previous number in the cycle from the preceding segment.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that 0s are replaced with the next number in the cycle of the nearest non-8 number in their segment.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nEach segment between 4s (since 4 is a separator like 8 in previous examples) would have their 0s replaced with the next number in the cycle. For example, if a segment between 4s has 0s, they are replaced with 8 (since 4 \u2192 8). If a segment has 6s, 0s next to them become 3s. \n\nBut the test input's structure uses 4 as a separator. For example, the first line is [0,0,4,0,0,4,...]. Between the 4s are 0s. According to the rule, those 0s would become 8s. The line would then start with [8,8,4,8,8,4,...]. \n\nAnother part of the test input has segments with 6s. For example, line 3: ...4,6,6,4... The 0s adjacent to 6s would become 3s.\n\nPutting this all together, the test output would have:\n\n- 0s adjacent to 4 replaced with 8.\n- 0s adjacent to 6 replaced with 3.\n- 0s adjacent to 3 replaced with 6.\n- 0s adjacent to 8 remain 0 (if 8 is a separator).\n\nSo applying this to each line:\n\nTake the first line of the test input: [0,0,4,0,0,4,...]. Replace the 0s before each 4 with 8s. So becomes [8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,...].\n\nIn lines where there are 8s and 3s, like line 6: [0,0,4,0,0,4,8,8,4,3,3,4,8,8,4,...], the 0s adjacent to 4 become 8s, adjacent to 3s become 6s. So the line becomes [8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,4,6,6,4,8,8,4,...].\n\nFor lines with 6s, like line 3: [0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,6,6,4,0,0,4,0,0], the 0s adjacent to 4 become 8s, and the 0s adjacent to 6 become 3s. So the 0s before the 6s (positions 20-21) would become 8s (since they are adjacent to 4s), and the 0s after the 6s (positions 24-25) are adjacent to 4s, so become 8s. But wait, the 6s are at positions 21-22. The line would be: [8,8,4,8,8,4,...8,8,4,6,6,4,8,8,4...].\n\nThe last few lines of the test input have [6,6,4,0,0,4...]. The 0s after the 4 would become 8s, so the line becomes [6,6,4,8,8,4...].\n\nPutting all this together, the test output would have 8s replacing 0s adjacent to 4, 6s replacing 0s adjacent to 3, and 3s replacing 0s adjacent to 6. The 8s and 4s act as separators, and their adjacent 0s are replaced based on the cycle.\n\nFinally, the answer should follow the same format as the training examples, with each input line transformed according to the pattern.",
