        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input is transformed into the output. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, there are some numbers like 2, 4, and 1. The output seems to have these numbers moved towards the center or combined. The first row of the input is [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and in the output, the 2s are in the same position but in the second row. The third row of the input has 4,4, which in the output is in the second row, merged with the 2s and 1s. So maybe there's a vertical movement here. The output rows are mostly zeros except for the middle rows where the numbers are stacked.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, there are blocks of 2s, 4s, and 1s. The output brings all these blocks into the fifth and sixth rows, aligned. Like the 2s are on the left, then 1s, then 4s on the right. So it seems like the non-zero numbers are being collapsed vertically into certain rows and arranged left to right based on their type. Wait, in the output of Example 1, the 2s are first, then 1s, then 4s. The order might be based on the number's value. Like lower numbers come first when arranged from left to right.\n\nExample 2's input has 1, 2, and 4 in different positions. The output brings them into the middle rows. For instance, the third row in input has 1, 2, and 4 spread out, but in the output, they are aligned in the same columns but in consecutive rows. So maybe numbers are falling down to the lowest possible row in their column, but also grouped with others of the same number?\n\nWait, maybe each number group (like all 2s, 4s, etc.) is being moved to a specific row, and within that row, they are placed in the leftmost possible position without overlapping. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 2s are in row 1, 4s in columns 4-5, and 1s in 7-8. So maybe the numbers are sorted by their value and arranged left to right. Like 1,2,4? Or maybe the order is based on their original positions but consolidated. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be stacking each group of numbers into their own horizontal bands. Like in Example 0, 2s are in row 1 and 2, 4s in row 1 and 2 (columns 4-5), and 1s in the same rows (columns 7-8). So each number type is grouped into consecutive rows, aligned to the left or right?\n\nWait, looking at the outputs:\n\n- In Example 0's output, the non-zero rows are rows 1 and 2. Each number group is in a contiguous block. The 2s are in columns 1-2, 4s in 4-5, 1s in 7-8. All starting at the same row. So perhaps each number is moved to a specific row, and aligned left to right in the order of their values. Like 2s come before 4s which come before 1s? No, because 1 is less than 2 and 4. Wait that doesn't make sense. In Example 0's output, 2s are leftmost, then 4s, then 1s. So maybe the order is based on the order they appear in the input from top to bottom? Like the first group encountered is placed leftmost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all the numbers are collected, sorted by their value, and then arranged left to right in that order. Let's see: in Example 0, the numbers are 2,4,1. If sorted, it would be 1,2,4. But in the output, the order is 2,4,1. So that's not matching. So that idea might be wrong.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the numbers are 4s on top, then 2s, then 1s. The output in the non-zero rows (5 and 6) have 2s first, then 1s, then 4s. So the order in the output is 2,1,4. That doesn't match sorted order. So maybe the order is based on the vertical layers. Like the lower the number's original position, the further left they are placed. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the input and output for each example, perhaps the output is merging all the same numbers into a single block, moving them to the center rows, and arranging them in the order they appear from left to right in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is taking each number's position and moving it down as far as possible, similar to how blocks fall in Tetris, but only moving vertically. But in Example 0, the 2s in the first and second rows of the input are moved to the second row in the output, but in the output they are in the same columns. Wait, the input has 2s in the first row (row 0?) and the output's 2s are in rows 1 and 2. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, considering that in Example 0's input:\n\nFirst row: 0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nSecond row: 0,2,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0\n\nThird row: 0,0,0,0,4,4,0,1,1,0\n\nFourth row: 0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0\n\nSo in the output, the 2s are in rows 1 and 2, columns 1-2. The 4s are in rows 1 and 2, columns 4-5. The 1s are in rows 1 and 2, columns 7-8.\n\nIt looks like each group of numbers (2s, 4s, 1s) are combined into two rows, stacked vertically. So maybe the output is taking each group and placing them in consecutive rows in the middle of the grid, and arranging them left to right based on their original horizontal positions.\n\nWait, the 2s are in columns 1-2, which is the leftmost group. Then the 4s in columns 4-5, then 1s in 7-8. But in the input, the 2s are in the left, then 4s, then 1s. So maybe the horizontal arrangement in the output is preserving the original left-to-right order of the groups.\n\nSo the process could be:\n\n1. For each number (non-zero), group them by their value and track their horizontal positions.\n\n2. Sort these groups based on their leftmost occurrence in the input.\n\n3. Then, in the output, place each group's blocks in consecutive rows (like two rows for each group?), starting from the middle of the grid, and arrange the groups left to right in the order determined in step 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each distinct number is placed in a horizontal band in the output. The order of the bands (left to right) depends on the order the numbers first appeared in the input. For example, in Example 0, the first non-zero number is 2, then 1, then 4. Wait, but in the input, the first occurrence is 2, then 1, then 4. But in the output, the order is 2,4,1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe the order is based on the value. Or perhaps the vertical position where the group first appears.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all the numbers are moved to the middle rows and aligned in the order they appear from top to bottom in the input. For instance, in Example 0, the 2s are first, then the 1s, then the 4s. But no, the output has 2s, then 4s, then 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: the output seems to have non-zero values only in certain middle rows, with the rest being zeros. For example, in Example 0's output, rows 1 and 2 are non-zero. In Example 1's output, rows 5 and 6. Example 2's output has rows 2 and 3. So perhaps the non-zero groups are placed in the middle two rows of the original input's vertical span of that group.\n\nWait, let's check Example 0's input. The 2s are in rows 0 and 1. The 1s are in rows 1 and 2. The 4s are in rows 2 and 3. So their vertical spans are:\n\n- 2s: rows 0-1\n\n- 1s: rows 1-2\n\n- 4s: rows 2-3\n\nThe output for 2s is rows 1 and 2. Wait, no. Output's 2s are in rows 1 and 2. But original rows for 2s were 0 and 1. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arranges each group into two consecutive rows in the middle of the grid. Like in Example 0, the grid has 5 rows. The middle rows are 2. But output's non-zero rows are 1 and 2 (0-based index?), which would be the second and third rows. Maybe each group is centered vertically. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output collapses all the non-zero elements into the fewest possible rows, stacked in the middle. For instance, in Example 0, the output has two non-zero rows. Maybe each group is placed in two consecutive rows, and arranged left to right in the order of their appearance.\n\nBut I need to find a consistent pattern across all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input has 9 rows. The output's non-zero rows are 5 and 6. Which is towards the middle. The groups are 2s, 1s, 4s. In the input, 4s are at the top, then 2s, then 1s. In the output, they are arranged left to right as 2s, 1s, 4s. So perhaps the groups are ordered based on their first occurrence's row. The 4s first appear in row 0, 2s in row 2, and 1s in row 5. So sorted by their first occurrence's row in ascending order, which would be 4s (row 0), 2s (row 2), 1s (row5). But in the output, the order is 2s, 1s, 4s. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order is determined by the vertical position where the group is in the input, with higher groups (earlier rows) being placed to the left. But the 4s in Example 1 are in the top rows, but in the output they are placed to the right. So maybe the opposite: lower rows (later in the input) are placed to the left. For example, the 2s start at row 2, 1s at row 5, 4s at row 0. So arranging based on their starting row in reverse order. 1s start at row 5 (highest), then 2s at row 2, then 4s at row 0. So the order would be 1s, 2s, 4s. But the output has 2s first. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is based on the value of the numbers, sorted in ascending order. So 1, 2, 4. But in Example 0's output, the order is 2,4,1. That's not matching. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order is based on the horizontal position of the leftmost occurrence of each group. For example, in Example 0:\n\n- 2s start at column 1.\n\n- 4s start at column 4.\n\n- 1s start at column 7.\n\nSo leftmost columns first. So 2, then 4, then 1. Which matches the output. In Example 1:\n\n- 4s start at column 7.\n\n- 2s start at column 1.\n\n- 1s start at column 4.\n\nSo leftmost is 2s (column1), then 1s (column4), then 4s (column7). Which matches the output order (2s, 1s, 4s). In Example 2's input:\n\nThe groups are 1, 2, 4.\n\n- 1 starts at column 1 (row2).\n\n- 2 starts at column3 (row1).\n\n- 4 starts at column6 (row3).\n\nLeftmost is 1 (column1), then 2 (column3), then4 (column6). So in the output, the order should be 1,2,4. Let's check Example 2's output. The non-zero rows are 2 and3. The numbers are arranged as 1 in column1, 2 in column3, 4 in column6. So yes, left to right in order of their leftmost occurrence. So this seems to be the pattern.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n1. For each group of numbers (same value), note their leftmost column in the input.\n\n2. Sort the groups based on the leftmost column (from left to right).\n\n3. In the output, arrange each group's blocks in consecutive rows (two rows?), and place them left to right in the order determined in step 2.\n\nAdditionally, each group is placed in the middle of the grid. For example, in Example 0, the groups are 2,4,1. Their leftmost columns are 1,4,7. Sorted left to right, so order is 2,4,1. Each group is placed in two consecutive rows (rows 1 and 2 for example 0's output). Then, the other rows are zeros.\n\nSo how are the rows chosen for each group? It seems like they're placed in the middle of the original input's vertical span? Or maybe the middle of the entire grid.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the grid has 5 rows. The output's non-zero rows are 1 and 2 (assuming 0-based index). The middle of 5 rows is row 2. But the non-zero rows are 1 and 2. Maybe the middle two rows for even number of rows? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all the groups are placed in the middle two rows of the entire output. For example, in Example 0, the output has 5 rows, so the middle rows are 2. But the non-zero rows are 1 and 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the groups are each placed in their own two consecutive rows in the middle of the output. For instance, in Example 0, the output has 5 rows. The middle is row 2. So the 2s are in rows 1 and 2, 4s also in rows 1 and 2, and 1s in rows1 and2. But they are arranged horizontally without overlapping.\n\nBut how to arrange vertically? Maybe the groups are stacked in the same two rows, but spread horizontally. So each group is placed in the same two middle rows, but left to right in order of their leftmost occurrence.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. For example, in Example0, the 2s are in columns1-2, 4s in4-5, and 1s in7-8, all in rows1 and2. Similarly, in Example1, the groups are 2s (columns1-3), 1s (columns4-6), 4s (7-9), all in rows5 and6. And in Example2, groups are 1 (column1-2?), 2 (column3-4?), 4 (column6-7?), all in rows2 and3.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Identify all unique number groups (non-zero).\n\n2. For each group, find the leftmost column in the input.\n\n3. Sort the groups in the order of their leftmost column from left to right.\n\n4. In the output, create two consecutive rows (probably centered vertically) where each group is placed in the order determined, left to right, each group's blocks (same number) placed in their original horizontal positions but merged into these two rows.\n\nWait, but how are the rows determined? For example, in Example0, the input has 5 rows. Output uses rows1 and2. Example1 has 10 rows. The output uses rows5 and6 (0-based index). So 10 rows, middle is between 4 and5. Rows5 and6 are the fifth and sixth rows (if 0-based, index 5 and 6 would be 6th and 7th rows). Wait, maybe it's the middle two rows. For an even number of rows, like 10, the middle would be between 4 and5 (0-based). So rows5 and6 are the two middle rows. For 5 rows (0-based indices 0-4), the middle is row2. But in Example0, the non-zero rows are1 and2, which is two rows. So perhaps regardless of the grid's height, the groups are placed in two middle rows. Wait, but in Example0, the grid has5 rows. Middle row is 2 (index2). The non-zero rows are1 and2. So two rows. For even heights, like 10 rows (indices0-9), the middle two are rows4 and5. But in Example1, which has 10 rows, the non-zero rows are5 and6 (indices5 and6). Wait, that's not matching. Wait, perhaps the output rows are determined by the middle of the input's rows. Let's check:\n\nExample0 input has5 rows. Middle row is2 (0-based). The output uses rows1 and2, which is the middle and the row above. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all groups are placed in the same two rows in the output, regardless of the input's size, but where these two rows are the middle of the original input's height.\n\nExample0 input has5 rows. Middle is row2 (third row). The output's non-zero rows are1 and2 (second and third). So perhaps centered around the middle row. So two rows if the input has an odd number of rows.\n\nExample1 input has10 rows. Middle would be between rows4 and5 (indices4 and5). The output's non-zero rows are5 and6. Wait, that's indices5 and6, which is below the middle. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the middle two rows of the output are used. Let's see the output in Example1 has 10 rows, so the middle two would be rows4 and5 (indices4 and5), but the non-zero rows are5 and6. So perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's non-zero rows are determined by the vertical positions of the groups in the input. For example, each group is moved to the middle of their own vertical span. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAnother angle: look at the test input and see if applying the same pattern gives the correct answer.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2] row0\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2] row1\n[0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0] row2\n[0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] row3\n[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] row4\n[0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0] row5\n[0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0] row6\n[0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0] row7\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] row8\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] row9\n\nSo the test input has 10 rows (indices0-9). Let's identify the groups:\n\n- 2s: present in rows0,1,2 (columns8-9 in rows0-1, and column7 in row2).\n\nWait, but the numbers are 2s. Let's check each group:\n\nLooking for distinct numbers (non-zero):\n\n1. 2s: in rows0,1 (columns8-9), row2 (column7). Wait, perhaps these are separate groups. Wait, but in row2, there's 2 in column7, but also 1s in columns1-2. So maybe 2s in row0-1 (columns8-9), and another 2 in row2 (column7). Are these considered separate groups? Or grouped together if they are the same number but not contiguous?\n\nThis is a key question. If same numbers are contiguous, they form a group. Otherwise, separate?\n\nAlternatively, maybe all instances of the same number are considered part of the same group, regardless of their positions. But then in Example0, the 2s are in rows0-1, columns1-2. So a single group. Similarly, the 1s are in rows1-2, columns7-8. So a single group.\n\nIn the test input, the 2s are in:\n\n- rows0,1: columns8-9.\n\n- row2: column7.\n\n- Also, in row4, column0 is 1. Oh, no, row4 has 1 in column0. So 1s are in rows2-3 (columns1-2) and row4 (column0).\n\nWait, the test input's groups:\n\n- 2s:\n\n  - rows0-1: columns8-9 (two rows of 2s).\n\n  - row2: column7 (a single 2).\n\nBut perhaps these are considered separate groups? Or part of the same group. Because they are the same number but not contiguous.\n\nIn Example2's input, there's a 2 in row1, column3, and another in row2, column3. Are they part of the same group? The output shows them merged into two rows. So perhaps same number is considered a single group, even if they are not contiguous.\n\nSo perhaps the groups are all instances of the same number, regardless of their positions, and the leftmost column is the minimum column across all instances of that number.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nNumbers present are 1, 2, 4.\n\n- 1s:\n\n  - row2,3: columns1-2.\n\n  - row4: column0.\n\nSo the leftmost column for 1s is 0 (row4, column0).\n\n- 2s:\n\n  - rows0,1: columns8-9.\n\n  - row2: column7.\n\nLeftmost column for 2s is 7 (row2, column7).\n\n- 4s:\n\n  - rows5,6: columns4-5.\n\n  - row7: column3.\n\nLeftmost column for 4s is 3 (row7, column3).\n\nSo the groups sorted by leftmost column:\n\n- 1s (leftmost 0), then 4s (3), then 2s (7).\n\nSo in the output, they should be arranged left to right as 1s, 4s, 2s.\n\nEach group should occupy two consecutive rows in the middle of the output.\n\nSince the test input has 10 rows (0-9), the middle two rows would be rows4 and5 (indices4 and5). But looking at the training examples:\n\nExample1's input has 10 rows, and the output uses rows5 and6 (indices5 and6). Which are the 6th and 7th rows. So maybe for even-numbered input rows (like 10 rows), the output uses the two middle rows, which would be rows4 and5 for 10 rows (since 10/2=5, so rows4 and5 (0-based)). But in Example1's output, the non-zero rows are 5 and6. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the output's non-zero rows are chosen as the two rows that are centered in the input's height. For the test input, which has 10 rows (indices0-9), the middle is between rows4 and5. So the two rows would be4 and5. But in Example1's input, which also has10 rows, the non-zero rows are5 and6. Hmm, this discrepancy suggests that maybe the vertical position in the output is based on the original positions of the groups.\n\nAlternatively, each group is moved to the middle of their own vertical span. For example, in the test input:\n\n- 1s are in rows2,3,4.\n\nThe vertical span is from row2 to row4 (3 rows). The middle would be row3. So the 1s would be placed in two consecutive rows, say 3 and4.\n\n- 4s are in rows5,6,7. Vertical span is rows5-7. Middle row is6. So placed in rows6 and5? Or 6 and7?\n\n- 2s are in rows0,1,2. Vertical span rows0-2. Middle row1. So placed in rows1 and0? Or1 and2?\n\nBut this approach might not fit the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, all groups are placed in two rows in the middle of the entire grid, regardless of their original positions. For the test input's 10 rows, the middle two rows are4 and5 (indices4 and5). So the output would have the groups in rows4 and5. But in Example1's input with10 rows, the groups are in rows5 and6, which is one row lower than the middle. So perhaps this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output's non-zero rows are the two rows just below the middle. For even-sized grids, maybe. For example, 10 rows: middle between4 and5. So rows5 and6. Which matches Example1's output. For Example0's input (5 rows), middle row2. So rows1 and2 (just below and middle). Which matches Example0's output. For Example2's input (5 rows), output uses rows2 and3 (indices2 and3), which would be just below the middle. Wait, in Example2, input has5 rows. Middle row is2. So output rows2 and3. Yes. So this seems to fit.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\nFor the output, all non-zero groups are placed in two consecutive rows that are just below the middle of the input's row count. For even number of rows, middle is between rows (n-1)/2 and n/2. For example:\n\n- 10 rows: middle between4.5. So the two rows would be5 and6 (indices5 and6).\n\n- 5 rows: middle at row2. So two rows just below would be rows3 and4? No, but in Example0's output, rows1 and2 are used. Wait, maybe I'm not getting it right.\n\nAlternatively, for an input with m rows:\n\nIf m is even, the two middle rows are m/2 -1 and m/2. For example, m=10: rows4 and5. But Example1 uses rows5 and6. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two rows are placed at the vertical center of all the groups. For instance, in the test input, the groups are spread across various rows. But this seems too vague.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the vertical positioning is not the key part. Maybe the main pattern is that each group is placed in two consecutive rows, merged into their own horizontal block, and ordered left to right by the leftmost column of the group. The vertical position is the middle of the output.\n\nBut given the examples, let's assume that the vertical position for the test input would be rows5 and6 (like in Example1). Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nGroups ordered by leftmost column: 1s (column0), 4s (column3), 2s (column7).\n\nEach group is placed left to right.\n\nNow, each group's horizontal position:\n\n- 1s: leftmost column0. In the output, they should be placed starting at column0. But how much space do they take?\n\nIn the input, the 1s are in:\n\n- row2,3: columns1-2 (two 1s in each row).\n\n- row4: column0 (a single 1).\n\nSo the horizontal span for 1s is from column0 to column2. So the group's width is 3 (columns0-2). So in the output, they would occupy columns0-2.\n\nBut in the input, the 1s in row4 are column0, which is further left than the others. So the leftmost column is0. So the entire group's leftmost is0. So in the output, the 1s would start at column0 and take up their original width. For the 1s, the width is maximum from the input. For example, in rows2-3, columns1-2 (two 1s), and row4, column0 (one 1). So the width is from0 to2 (columns0,1,2). So the block would be three columns wide. But how is this merged?\n\nWait, in the training examples, the output seems to merge all instances of a group into two consecutive rows, but the horizontal positions are taken from the leftmost occurrence. For example, in Example0's input, the 2s are in columns1-2 across rows0-1. In the output, they are in columns1-2 in two rows. So the group's horizontal span is preserved. So in the test input:\n\n- 1s: leftmost column0. The width is from0 to2 (columns0,1,2). Because in the input, the 1s are in column0 (row4), and columns1-2 (rows2-3). So the maximum width is from0 to2. So in the output, the 1s would be columns0-2 in the two rows.\n\n- 4s: leftmost column3. In the input, 4s are in columns4-5 (rows5-6), and column3 (row7). So the leftmost column is3. The width would be from3 to5, since row7 has column3, but rows5-6 have4-5. So the maximum width is3 (column3) to5 (column5). So the group's horizontal span is3-5.\n\n- 2s: leftmost column7. In the input, 2s are in columns8-9 (rows0-1), column7 (row2). So leftmost is7. The width is from7 to9 (columns7-9). So in output, they occupy7-9.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nRows5 and6 (assuming 10 rows, middle rows5-6):\n\nRow5: [0,1,1,0,4,4,0,2,2,2]\n\nWait, but no. The 1s would be in columns0-2. 4s in3-5, and 2s in7-9. So row5 would be:\n\n0,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2?\n\nWait, perhaps each group is represented as their original contiguous blocks. But in Example0's output, the 2s are two columns (1-2), 4s two columns (4-5), and 1s two columns (7-8). So each group takes up their original width. So in the test input:\n\n- 1s: the original width for the largest block is two columns (rows2-3, columns1-2). But there's a single 1 in row4, column0. So the leftmost is0, but the width would be from0 to2 (columns0,1,2). But in the output, maybe they're represented as two columns (0-1) for the group? Because the largest block is two columns. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the group's width is determined by the maximum contiguous block. For example, in the test input's 1s:\n\nThe largest contiguous block is two columns (1-2). But there's also a single 1 in column0. So perhaps the group is split into two parts: column0 and columns1-2. But in the training examples, the groups are merged even if they are not contiguous. Like in Example0, the 1s are in rows1 and2, columns7-8, which is contiguous. So perhaps non-contiguous instances are merged into a single block spanning from the leftmost to the rightmost column.\n\nSo for the test input's 1s:\n\nLeftmost column0, rightmost column2. So the group occupies columns0-2. Even if there are gaps (like column0 is only in row4, and columns1-2 in rows2-3), the output merges them into a continuous block from0 to2. So in the output rows, the 1s would be in columns0-2, filled with 1s in two consecutive rows.\n\nSimilarly, the 4s: leftmost column3, rightmost column5. So columns3-5. So in the output, 4s are in columns3-5.\n\nThe 2s: leftmost column7, rightmost column9. So columns7-9.\n\nThus, the output would have in rows5 and6:\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nNo, the output rows would have:\n\n1s in columns0-2 (for two rows), 4s in3-5, 2s in7-9. So row5 and6 would be:\n\nRow5: [1,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2]\n\nRow6: [1,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2]\n\nWait, but in the training examples, each group is only their original size. For example, in Example1's output, the 2s are three columns (1-3), 1s three columns (4-6), and 4s three columns (7-9). So each group's width is determined by their original contiguous blocks. But perhaps if the group has multiple blocks, they are merged into a single block spanning from leftmost to rightmost column.\n\nIn the test input's 1s, leftmost0, rightmost2. So columns0-2. So in the output, the 1s would occupy columns0-2 with 1s. Even if there are gaps in between. So in rows5 and6, columns0-2 would have 1s.\n\nSimilarly, 4s occupy columns3-5. 2s 7-9.\n\nThus, the output rows5 and6 would be:\n\nRow5: 1,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2 \u2192 but wait, the 4s in the input are in columns4-5 (rows5-6) and column3 (row7). So leftmost3, rightmost5. So columns3-5. So three columns. So 4s would fill columns3-5.\n\n2s have leftmost7, rightmost9. So columns7-9. Three columns (7,8,9).\n\nSo row5 and6 would be:\n\nFor row5: [1,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2]\n\nFor row6: [1,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2]\n\nBut the original test input's 1s in row4, column0 is a single 1, which might not fit into a contiguous block of 0-2. But according to the pattern observed in training examples, perhaps all instances of the same number are merged into a single block spanning from leftmost to rightmost column.\n\nBut wait, in Example2's input, the 1s are in row2, columns1 and2, and row3, columns1 and2. So leftmost1, rightmost2. So merged into columns1-2. The output shows them in columns1-2.\n\nBut in the input, there's a 1 in row2, column1, and row3, column1. But in the output, they are merged into two rows of 1s in columns1-2.\n\nSo it's possible that the group's block is determined by their leftmost and rightmost occurrences, merged into a contiguous block.\n\nThus, in the test input's 1s:\n\nLeftmost column0, rightmost column2. So the block is columns0-2. So in the output, 1s would fill columns0-2 for two rows.\n\nSimilarly, 4s: columns3-5.\n\n2s: columns7-9.\n\nSo the output rows5 and6 would be:\n\nRow5: [1,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2]\n\nRow6: [1,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2]\n\nBut wait, between columns2 and3, and between5 and7, there are zeros. So the output would have:\n\nRow5: 1,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2 \u2192 which sums to 10 elements.\n\nBut each row must have 10 elements. Let's check:\n\nIndices 0-9.\n\n0:1,1:1,2:1,3:4,4:4,5:4,6:0,7:2,8:2,9:2. That's 10 elements.\n\nSame for row6.\n\nBut in the training examples, there are zeros between the groups. For example, in Example0's output, between the 2s (columns1-2) and 4s (columns4-5), there's a zero in column3. Similarly between4s and1s, zeros in column6.\n\nAh, right. So the groups are placed left to right in order of leftmost column, but separated by zeros between the end of one group and the start of the next.\n\nSo for the test input's groups ordered as 1s (0-2), 4s (3-5), 2s (7-9), between the 1s and4s would be column3, which is the start of 4s. So no space. Wait, but 1s end at column2, 4s start at3. So no zeros in between. Similarly, 4s end at5, next group is2s at7. So columns6 would be zero. So the output rows for5 and6 would be:\n\nRow5: [1,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2]\n\nRow6: [1,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2]\n\nBut let's check the training examples. In Example0's output, between the 2s (cols1-2) and4s (4-5), there's a zero in column3. Because the 2s end at2, and4s start at4. So column3 is zero. Similarly between4s and1s, column6 is zero. So the groups are spaced with at least one zero between them.\n\nBut in the test input case, after 1s end at2, 4s start at3. So no gap. Is that allowed?\n\nLooking at Example1's output, the groups are 2s (columns1-3), 1s (4-6), and4s (7-9). So columns3 and4 are adjacent. But in Example1's output, there's no gap between 2s and1s. So the groups are placed immediately next to each other.\n\nYes, in Example1's output:\n\nRow5: 0,2,2,2,1,1,1,4,4,4\n\nRow6: same.\n\nSo between the 2s (columns1-3) and 1s (4-6), there's no gap. The groups are placed consecutively.\n\nSo, the groups are placed left to right in order of leftmost column, with no gaps in between. Thus, in the test input's case:\n\n1s (0-2), 4s (3-5), 2s (7-9). So between 1s and4s, no gap. Between 4s and2s, column6 is empty (zero).\n\nSo the output rows5 and6 would be:\n\nRow5: [1,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2]\n\nRow6: [1,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2]\n\nBut wait, the 4s are from columns3-5. Then comes column6 (zero), then 2s in7-9.\n\nYes. That seems to fit.\n\nNow, the rest of the rows in the output would be zeros.\n\nThus, the test input's output would have:\n\nMost rows are zeros except rows5 and6.\n\nBut wait, the test input's output needs to be in the same format as the training examples. Let's check the training examples' outputs.\n\nIn Example0, the output has two non-zero rows.\n\nIn Example1, two non-zero rows.\n\nIn Example2, two non-zero rows.\n\nThus, the test output should have two non-zero rows (rows5 and6 in this case), with the groups arranged left to right as 1s,4s,2s.\n\nSo the final output would have 10 rows. Rows5 and6 are filled with 1s,4s,2s as described, and the rest are zeros.\n\nNow, let's verify this.\n\nTest input's groups:\n\n1s: columns0-2, rows5-6.\n\n4s: columns3-5, rows5-6.\n\n2s: columns7-9, rows5-6.\n\nSo rows5 and6 would be:\n\nRow5: 1,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2\n\nRow6: 1,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2\n\nBut wait, in the input, the 4s in row7 (column3) is part of the 4s group. But in the output, they are merged into columns3-5. So even though there's a 4 in column3, the group's width is3-5.\n\nSo the output rows5 and6 would indeed have the groups as described.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\nAll rows except rows5 and6 are zeros. Rows5 and6 are as above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples, then apply that pattern to the test input. Let me start by carefully examining each example to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input has several rows with numbers like 2, 4, and 1. The output seems to have these numbers clustered in the middle rows. For instance, the second row of the output has 2,2 followed by 4,4 and then 1,1. The original input had these numbers spread out in different rows. So maybe the transformation is moving these blocks down or up to merge them into a single row, but how exactly?\n\nWait, in the input, the 2s are in rows 0 and 1, 4s in row 2 and 3, and 1s in rows 1 and 2. The output compresses them into rows 1 and 2. So perhaps the pattern is to collapse each group of consecutive identical numbers into a single row, stacking them vertically in the output. But how does the order work?\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has different blocks: 4s at the top right, 2s in the middle left, 1s lower down. The output moves all these blocks to the fifth and sixth rows (index 5 and 6), combining them left to right. So 2s, then 1s, then 4s. The order here might be based on their original vertical positions. The 2s were higher up than the 1s and 4s, but in the output, they are arranged left to right. Wait, in the output, the 2s are leftmost, then 1s, then 4s. So maybe the order is based on the original horizontal position? Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 4s are in the rightmost columns (columns 7-9), the 2s are in columns 1-3, and the 1s in columns 4-6. So in the output, they're arranged from left to right in the order of their original leftmost positions. 2s start at column 1, 1s at column 4, 4s at column 7. So left to right in the output as per their original left positions. And vertically, they are placed in the middle rows. So perhaps the pattern is to collect all non-zero blocks, arrange them left to right based on their original leftmost column, stack them horizontally in the output's middle rows, and all other rows are zeros.\n\nWait, but how do they end up in the same rows? Like in Example 0, the output has two rows (1 and 2) with the merged blocks. Example 1's output has rows 5 and 6. So maybe the middle rows of the input are where the blocks are merged. Let's check the input and output row counts.\n\nExample 0 input has 5 rows. Output has 5 rows. The merged blocks are in rows 1 and 2 (original input's rows 1 and 2 maybe?), but the output here has two rows with the merged data. Hmm. Maybe the process is to find each contiguous vertical group of the same number and then move them to the middle rows, merging adjacent blocks. Wait, that might not fit.\n\nAnother approach: looking for each horizontal block of numbers. For example, in input example 0, the first row has [0,2,2,0,...], the second row has [0,2,2,0,...] followed by 1,1. The third row has 4s and 1s, etc. The output compresses these into two rows where all the blocks are aligned. So perhaps the transformation is taking all horizontal blocks (contiguous same numbers in a row) and then moving them to the middle of the grid, arranging them left to right in the order of their original positions, and vertically centered.\n\nBut how to determine the vertical position? In example 0, the output has the merged blocks in rows 1 and 2. The original input's 2s are in rows 0 and 1, 4s in rows 2 and 3, 1s in rows 1 and 2. So maybe each horizontal block is moved to the row that is the average of their original rows. For instance, the 2s in rows 0 and 1 would average to row 0.5, rounded up or down. But the output has them in row 1 and 2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternative idea: The output rows correspond to the vertical center of each block. For example, in example 2's input, the 1s are in rows 2 and 3 (original input rows 2 and 3), and the 2s are in row 1 and 2. The 4s are in rows 3 and 4. The output places the merged blocks in rows 2 and 3. So maybe each block is moved to the middle of their original vertical span. Let's check:\n\nIn example 0, the 2s are in rows 0-1, so their vertical center is row 0.5. The 4s are in rows 2-3, center at 2.5. The 1s are in rows 1-2, center at 1.5. The output has the merged blocks in rows 1 and 2. Maybe the center rows are rounded down or up. But how to decide which row they go to. Alternatively, all the blocks are moved to the middle rows of the entire grid, arranged left to right.\n\nWait, example 0's input is 5 rows. The middle rows are 2 (since rows are 0-4). The output has the merged blocks in rows 1 and 2. Hmm. Not exactly the middle. Example 1's input is 10 rows. The middle would be around rows 4 and 5. The output in example 1 has the merged blocks in rows 5 and 6. That's a bit off. Maybe the vertical position depends on the original vertical position of the blocks. For example, in example 1, the 2s are in rows 2 and 3, 1s in 5 and 6, 4s in 0 and 1. In the output, they are arranged left to right, but vertically, they are placed in rows 5 and 6. So maybe the vertical position is the maximum of the original vertical positions? Or the lowest? For example, the 4s were in rows 0 and 1, but in the output they are in rows 5 and 6. That doesn't fit. So that's confusing.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the transformation is that all non-zero blocks are collapsed into the middle rows of the output, arranged left to right in the order of their original leftmost occurrence. So the blocks are sorted left to right based on their starting column, and then stacked in the middle rows of the output. The number of rows in the output that contain the merged blocks depends on the number of vertical layers in the original input. For example, in example 0, there are 2 layers (two rows each for 2,4,1), so the output has two rows. In example 1, each block (2,1,4) has two rows, so the output uses two rows. In example 2, the 1s,2s,4s each have one row in their blocks (since 1s are in rows 2 and 3, but perhaps each is a single row?), so merged into two rows. Wait, example 2's output has two rows (2 and 3) with the merged data. So maybe each original block's vertical height determines how many rows they take in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are determined by the vertical stacking of all the original blocks. For instance, each original horizontal block (a group of same numbers in a row) is moved to a certain row in the output, possibly overlapping. But how to avoid overlapping? Because in the output, the blocks are arranged left to right. So maybe in the output, all the blocks are placed in the middle rows, arranged left to right, each in their own vertical position. Wait, but the output examples have the same numbers across consecutive rows. Like in example 0, rows 1 and 2 have the same structure. So perhaps each original horizontal block is duplicated into two consecutive rows in the output if their original block spans multiple rows. For example, in example 0's 2s are in rows 0 and 1 (two rows), so in the output, they are placed in two consecutive rows (1 and 2). Similarly for the 4s (two rows in input, two rows in output) and 1s (two rows in input, two rows in output). But in the output, these are all merged into the same two rows. Wait, how? Because the output has 2s,4s,1s all in the same two rows, but arranged side by side. Oh right, because each block is placed in the same vertical position (rows) but different horizontal positions. So the transformation is:\n\nFor each horizontal block (same number in consecutive columns in a row), determine the vertical position in the output based on the original vertical position, and arrange all such blocks left to right in their original order, but overlapping vertically. Wait, but how are they combined into rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process is to collapse each group of vertically consecutive rows with the same pattern into a single row (or two rows if there were two), and then arrange the horizontal blocks from left to right in the output's middle rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: looking at example 2's input. The input has:\n\nRow 1: a single 2 in column 3.\n\nRow 2: 2 in column 3, 1 in column 1.\n\nRow 3: 1 in column 1, 4 in column 6.\n\nRow 4: 4 in column 6.\n\nThe output has:\n\nRow 2: 1 in column 1, 2 in column 3, 4 in column 6.\n\nRow 3: same as row 2.\n\nSo perhaps each unique number's blocks are moved to the middle of their original vertical span, and then arranged left to right. The 1s were in rows 2 and 3, their vertical middle is 2.5, rounded to row 2 and 3. Similarly, 2s in rows 1, 2, 3: middle is row 2. 4s in rows 3 and 4: middle 3.5. So in output, they are placed in rows 2 and 3, which might be the middle of the entire grid. The output rows are 5, so middle is row 2 (0-based index). But example 2's output has the merged blocks in rows 2 and 3, which are the middle two rows (since 5 rows total). Hmm, maybe for even number of rows, the middle two are chosen. For example, 5 rows: middle is row 2, but perhaps when there are multiple layers, they are placed in consecutive middle rows.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n1. Identify all the horizontal blocks (contiguous same numbers in a row) in the input.\n\n2. For each block, note their starting column and their vertical positions (rows they appear in).\n\n3. Then, in the output, arrange these blocks left to right based on their starting column.\n\n4. Vertically, place these blocks in the middle rows of the output grid. If there are multiple rows of blocks (like in example 0's input has 2s in rows 0 and 1, which are two rows), then the output uses two consecutive middle rows to stack them. So the number of rows in the output for each block is the same as the number of rows they occupied in the input. And they are placed in the middle of the grid.\n\nSo for example, in example 0's input, the 2s span two rows (0 and 1), so in the output, they are placed in two rows (1 and 2), which are the middle rows of the 5-row output. Similarly, the 4s in example 0's input are in two rows (2 and 3), so in output rows 1 and 2 again. The 1s in input rows 1 and 2, output rows 1 and 2. So all overlapping, but arranged left to right.\n\nWait, but how do they not overwrite each other? Because in the output, the same rows (1 and 2) have all the blocks. For example, in output example 0, row 1 has 2,2, then 4,4, then 1,1. So the blocks are arranged horizontally in the order of their original leftmost occurrence. The 2s start at column 1, 4s at column 4, 1s at column 7. So left to right in that order.\n\nSo the steps seem to be:\n\n- For each horizontal block (same number, contiguous in a row), note their starting column, the number, and the vertical span (number of rows they appear in consecutively).\n\n- Sort all these blocks in order of their starting column (leftmost first).\n\n- Determine the vertical position in the output. The vertical position is such that the blocks are centered vertically. For example, if the original block spans two rows, they are placed in two consecutive rows in the middle of the output. The total number of rows in the output is the same as the input. Wait, no. In example 0, the input has 5 rows, output also 5. So the output rows are the same as input. So the vertical positioning must be within the same number of rows.\n\nBut how to compute which rows in the output to place the blocks? For example, in example 0, the 2s are in input rows 0 and 1. The output rows 1 and 2. So maybe for a block that spans N rows, they are placed in the middle N rows of the output. But 5 rows total. Middle N rows for N=2 would be rows 2 and 3? But no, in example 0, the output uses rows 1 and 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical position is determined by the average of the original rows. For example, 0 and 1 average to 0.5, which rounds up to 1. So they start at row 1 and take 2 rows. So rows 1 and 2. That fits example 0. Similarly, for the 4s in rows 2 and 3, average is 2.5 \u2192 rows 2 and 3. But in example 0's output, they are in rows 1 and 2. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical position is such that the blocks are placed as low as possible without overlapping. But that's vague.\n\nLet me try to model this for each example:\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput rows: 5\n\nOutput rows:5\n\nBlocks:\n\n- 2s: columns 1-2, rows 0-1 (two rows)\n- 4s: columns 4-5, rows 2-3 (two rows)\n- 1s: columns 7-8, rows 1-2 (two rows)\n\nIn the output, these are arranged in rows 1 and 2. So all blocks are placed in two rows. So perhaps for each block, the number of rows in the output is the same as the original. But how are they placed in the same two rows? Because in the output, all three blocks are in the same two rows, but arranged left to right. So maybe the vertical placement is such that all blocks are merged into the middle rows. The total number of rows needed for all blocks is the maximum number of rows any single block spans. For example, in example 0, each block spans two rows, so the output uses two rows. These rows are placed in the middle of the grid. For 5 rows, the middle two rows would be 2 and 3 (since 5/2=2.5 \u2192 rows 2 and 3). But in example 0, the output uses rows 1 and 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the middle is calculated differently. For 5 rows, the exact middle is row 2. If the blocks need two rows, then starting at row 1 (so rows 1 and 2). So maybe the starting row is (total rows - number of block rows)/2, rounded down. For 5-2=3 \u2192 3/2=1.5 \u2192 row 1. So starts at row 1, uses two rows.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for a block that spans N rows in the input, in the output it's placed in N consecutive rows starting at row floor((total_rows - N)/2). For example, in example 0: total rows=5, N=2. (5-2)/2=1.5 \u2192 floor(1.5)=1. So starts at row 1, uses 2 rows (1 and 2). For a block that spans 1 row, (5-1)/2=2 \u2192 starts at row 2. So in example 2, which has 5 rows, a block with 2 rows would start at 1, a 1-row block starts at 2.\n\nIn example 1, the input has 10 rows, output 10 rows. The blocks (2,1,4) each span two rows. So (10-2)/2=4. So start at row 4, spans rows 4-5. But in the output example 1, the merged blocks are in rows 5 and 6. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe my formula is wrong. Let me check example 1.\n\nExample1 input has 10 rows. Output is 10 rows. The merged blocks are in rows 5 and 6. So for each block of two rows, how is that determined? (10-2)/2=4. So starting row 4, rows 4 and 5. But the output uses rows 5 and 6. That's conflicting. So perhaps the formula is (total_rows - N) // 2. For example, 10 rows, N=2: (10-2)/2=4. So starts at row 4, rows 4-5. But in the output, they are in rows 5 and 6. So this approach isn't working. Maybe the vertical positioning isn't determined by the block's own rows but by the entire set of blocks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all blocks are placed in the middle rows of the entire grid, regardless of their original vertical span. For example, in a 5-row grid, the middle is row 2. So if multiple blocks are to be placed, they are placed in consecutive rows starting from the middle. For example, if there are two rows needed, they are placed in rows 2 and 3 (for even N). But in example 0, they are placed in rows 1 and 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical position is determined such that all blocks are placed as close to the middle as possible, ordered from top to bottom based on their original vertical positions. For example, in example 0, the 2s are in the top, then 1s, then 4s. But the output arranges them all in the same two rows. So maybe not.\n\nAnother thought: the output rows correspond to the original rows where the blocks were present, but collapsed. For example, in example 0, the 2s are in rows 0 and 1. The output combines them into rows 1 and 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a \"compression\" where each horizontal line of blocks is moved to the vertical center of the grid. For instance, in example 0's input, the 2s are in the top, 1s in the middle, 4s in the middle. The output places them all in the middle two rows. Similarly, in example 1, all blocks are moved to the middle rows (5 and 6 in a 10-row grid). For a 10-row grid, the middle would be rows 4.5, so rows 4 and 5. But example 1's output uses rows 5 and 6. Hmm.\n\nWait, in example1's output, the merged blocks are in rows 5 and 6. Let me check the input rows for each block. The 4s are in rows 0 and 1, 2s in 2 and 3, 1s in 5 and 6. So the output placed them in rows 5 and 6, which is the same as the 1s' original position. That can't be a coincidence. So perhaps the blocks are moved to the vertical position of the lowest block in the group. But example0's blocks (2,4,1) have different original vertical positions, but are all placed in the same output rows. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think differently. What's the pattern in the output? All non-zero blocks are arranged left to right in the middle rows. For example, in example0, the 2s, then 4s, then 1s. Their order is based on the leftmost column of each block. So the 2s start at column 1, 4s at column 4, 1s at column 7. So left to right. The vertical position is the middle of the grid. So the middle rows of the output grid. For example, in a 5-row grid, the middle rows are 2. But since the blocks in example0 take two rows, they are placed in rows 1 and 2 (maybe to center them). So the vertical placement is to center the blocks vertically in the output grid, regardless of their original vertical position.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Collect all horizontal contiguous blocks (same number in a row).\n\n2. For each block, record the starting column, the number, and the number of rows (vertical span) they occupy in the input.\n\n3. Sort all blocks left to right based on their starting column.\n\n4. Determine the vertical position in the output: place all blocks in the middle rows of the output grid, vertically centered. If the total vertical span of all blocks is S rows, then they are placed starting at row floor((total_rows - S)/2).\n\nBut how to calculate S? For example, if there are multiple blocks with different vertical spans. Wait, in example0, each block has a vertical span of 2 rows (each appears in two rows). So S=2. Total rows=5. So start at (5-2)/2=1.5 \u2192 1. So rows 1 and 2. Which matches the output. In example1, each block has vertical span 2 rows. So S=2. Total rows=10. Start at (10-2)/2=4. So rows 4 and 5. But in example1's output, the blocks are in rows5 and 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe this approach isn't correct. Let's look at example2:\n\nInput has 5 rows. Output has 5 rows. The merged blocks are in rows 2 and 3. Each block (1,2,4) in the output has a vertical span of 2 rows. But in the input, the 1s are in rows2 and3 (two rows), 2s in rows1 and2 (two rows), 4s in rows3 and4 (two rows). So each has a vertical span of 2 rows, but overlapping. The output's merged blocks are in rows2 and3, which is the middle two rows. So start row2. (5-2)/2=1.5 \u2192 floor 1. So rows1 and2, but in example2's output, they're in rows2 and3. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nAlternative idea: the vertical position in the output is determined by the vertical position of the original blocks. For example, each block is moved to the vertical middle of the output, and then arranged left to right. But how to handle overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical position for each block in the output is the vertical middle of the original block's rows. For example:\n\nIn example0's 2s: original rows0 and1. Middle is 0.5 \u2192 row0.5. But output rows1 and2. So perhaps rounded down and take two rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each block is placed in the output such that their vertical center is the vertical center of the entire grid. For example, in example0, grid has 5 rows. Center is row2. So all blocks are placed such that their centers are at row2. For a two-row block, they occupy rows1 and2 (center at 1.5) or rows2 and3 (center at2.5). But in example0, the blocks are in rows1 and2, which centers at1.5. Which is below the grid's center of row2. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's consider another angle. Let's look at the test input and try to apply the possible patterns.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]\n[0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\n[0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe test input has several blocks:\n\n- 2s at the top right (columns8-9, rows0-1)\n- 1s in rows2-3, columns1-2\n- 2 in row2, column7 (but not contiguous)\nWait, row2 of the input is [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. So there's a 2 in column7, but not contiguous with the other 2s. So it's a single block of 2 in column7, row2. But maybe it's considered a separate block.\n- The row4 has a 1 in column0.\n- 4s in rows5-6, columns4-5.\n- row7 has a 4 in column3.\n\nSo possible blocks:\n\nBlock1: 2s in rows0-1, columns8-9 (two rows)\nBlock2: 1s in rows2-3, columns1-2 (two rows)\nBlock3: 2 in row2, column7 (single cell)\nBlock4: 1 in row4, column0 (single cell)\nBlock5: 4s in rows5-6, columns4-5 (two rows)\nBlock6: 4 in row7, column3 (single cell)\n\nNow, the output should arrange these blocks left to right based on their starting column. So the order would be:\n\nBlock4 (column0), Block2 (column1), Block6 (column3), Block5 (column4), Block3 (column7), Block1 (column8).\n\nEach of these blocks will be placed in the middle rows of the output. The test input has 10 rows. The output's middle rows would be around 5 and 6 (since 10 rows, indices 0-9). \n\nNow, each block's vertical span in the input determines how many rows they occupy in the output. For example:\n\nBlock1 spans 2 rows (0-1) \u2192 output uses 2 rows.\nBlock2: 2 rows (2-3) \u2192 2 rows.\nBlock3: 1 row (2) \u2192 1 row.\nBlock4: 1 row (4) \u2192 1 row.\nBlock5: 2 rows (5-6) \u2192 2 rows.\nBlock6: 1 row (7) \u2192 1 row.\n\nBut how to arrange them vertically? If the pattern is to place all blocks in the middle rows, sorted left to right, with their vertical spans. The total vertical spans might be the maximum number of rows needed. For example, if some blocks take 2 rows, others 1, perhaps the output uses 2 rows. But in example1, each block took 2 rows and the output used 2 rows. So maybe all blocks are arranged in the same number of rows as their vertical span, stacked in the middle.\n\nBut the test input's output needs to have the blocks arranged in the middle rows. For a 10-row output, the middle two rows are 5 and 6 (indices 5 and 6). If a block has a vertical span of 2, it would occupy rows5-6. If a block has a vertical span of 1, it would be placed in row5 or 6. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the vertical position of each block is determined by their original vertical position. For example, blocks from higher rows are placed higher in the output. But this may not fit the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, all blocks are moved to the middle rows, regardless of their original position, and arranged left to right. For example, in the test input, the middle rows are 5 and 6. So all blocks would be placed in rows5 and 6. But for blocks that require two rows, like Block1, Block2, Block5, they would need to be in two rows, but rows5-6. While single-row blocks are placed in one of these rows. However, in the output examples, each block's vertical span is maintained. For example, in example0's output, the 2s are in two rows (1-2), 4s in two rows (1-2), etc. So overlapping but arranged side by side.\n\nSo perhaps the test input's output will have the blocks arranged in rows5 and 6 (the middle two rows of the 10-row grid), left to right based on starting column. So:\n\nStarting columns:\n\nBlock4: 0 \u2192 leftmost\n\nBlock2:1\n\nBlock6:3\n\nBlock5:4\n\nBlock3:7\n\nBlock1:8\n\nEach block is placed in rows5 and 6 (if they span two rows) or row5 or 6 (if single row). But how to fit them. For example, Block1 (columns8-9) spans two rows (0-1 in input), so in output rows5 and6, columns8-9. Block2 (columns1-2) spans two rows (2-3 in input), so in output rows5-6. Block5 (columns4-5) spans two rows (5-6 in input), so rows5-6. The single-row blocks (Block3,4,6) would be placed in one row. But which one?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Looking back at example1, the output has two rows (5-6) with all the blocks arranged left to right. So perhaps all blocks are placed in two consecutive rows, regardless of their original vertical span, but their horizontal position is left to right based on starting column.\n\nIn example1's output, the blocks are in rows5 and6. Each block (2s,1s,4s) are in both rows. So each block's columns are present in both rows. For example, 2s are in columns1-3 in both rows5 and6. So perhaps each block's vertical span in the output is the same as the maximum vertical span of any block. For example, if any block has two rows, all blocks are represented in two rows. But how to handle blocks with different vertical spans.\n\nAlternatively, all blocks are placed in the same two middle rows, regardless of their original vertical span. So in the test case, all blocks are placed in rows5 and6. For example:\n\nRow5: Block4 (0), Block2 (1-2), Block6 (3), Block5 (4-5), Block3 (7), Block1 (8-9)\n\nRow6: same as row5.\n\nBut the single-row blocks like Block4, Block3, Block6 would have their values duplicated in both rows.\n\nBut in example2, the output has two rows (2 and3) with the merged blocks. Each block (1,2,4) are present in both rows, even though their original vertical spans vary (1s were in rows2-3, 2s in rows1-2, etc). So yes, they are duplicated into two rows.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- All horizontal blocks are sorted left to right by starting column.\n\n- They are placed in the middle rows of the output grid. The number of rows allocated is the maximum vertical span of any block. Wait, in example0, all blocks have span 2, so two rows. In example1, same. In example2, all blocks have span 2 (but in input, each block was present in two rows?), so two rows.\n\nBut wait, in example2's input, the 1s are in rows2 and3 (two rows), the 2s are in rows1 and2 (two rows), the 4s are in rows3 and4 (two rows). So each block's vertical span is two rows. So the output uses two rows (2 and3), which is the middle of the 5-row grid.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- For all blocks, determine their leftmost starting column.\n\n- Sort blocks left to right.\n\n- Determine the maximum vertical span (number of rows) of any block. Let's call this S.\n\n- Place all blocks in S consecutive rows starting at row floor((total_rows - S)/2) of the output grid.\n\n- For each block, copy their columns into these S rows, in the sorted order.\n\nThus, even if a block had a vertical span of 1 in the input, it would be duplicated into S rows in the output.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nBlocks:\n\nBlock4: starts at column0, vertical span1.\n\nBlock2: starts at column1, vertical span2.\n\nBlock6: starts at column3, vertical span1.\n\nBlock5: starts at column4, vertical span2.\n\nBlock3: starts at column7, vertical span1.\n\nBlock1: starts at column8, vertical span2.\n\nSorted order by starting column: Block4 (0), Block2 (1), Block6 (3), Block5 (4), Block3 (7), Block1 (8).\n\nMaximum vertical span S is 2 (from Block2, Block5, Block1).\n\nTotal rows in test input:10. So start row = floor((10-2)/2)=4.\n\nSo the blocks are placed in rows4 and5.\n\nWait, but in example1's output, the blocks are placed in rows5 and6 for a 10-row grid. So maybe the formula is different. Let's check example1:\n\nExample1 has 10 rows. S=2. start row = floor((10-2)/2) =4. So rows4 and5. But the output is rows5 and6. So this formula doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So maybe the formula is ceiling((total_rows - S)/2). For example, in example1: (10-2)/2=4 \u2192 ceiling is4. So start at row4. But rows4 and5. But example1's output uses rows5 and6. So this doesn't fit. Perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, the middle rows are calculated as follows: for even number of rows, the middle two are rows (n//2 -1) and n//2. For example, 10 rows: middle rows are4 and5 (indices4 and5). But example1's output uses rows5 and6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the middle rows are chosen to be as close to the bottom as possible when there's an even number. Not sure.\n\nLet me look at example1's input and output again.\n\nExample1's input has blocks:\n\n- 4s in rows0-1, columns7-9 (two rows)\n\n- 2s in rows2-3, columns1-3 (two rows)\n\n- 1s in rows5-6, columns4-6 (two rows)\n\nOutput places all these blocks in rows5-6 (indices5 and6). So perhaps the vertical position is determined by the latest possible block's vertical position. For example, the 1s are in the lowest original position (rows5-6), so the output uses those rows. But in example0, the 1s were in rows1-2, 4s in rows2-3, but the output used rows1-2. So this idea doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical position is determined by the average of the original block positions. For example, in example1, blocks are in rows0-1, 2-3,5-6. The average of all these rows is (0+1+2+3+5+6)/6= (17)/6 \u2248 2.83. But output rows5-6. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I need to find another approach.\n\nLet me consider that the output's rows are the same as the input's rows, but the non-zero blocks are moved to the middle rows, aligned horizontally in the order of their starting columns.\n\nSo in example0, the input is 5 rows. The output's middle rows are 1 and2. The blocks are placed there, left to right.\n\nIn example1, 10 rows. Middle rows are 5 and6. The blocks are placed there.\n\nIn example2, 5 rows. Middle rows are2 and3. Blocks placed there.\n\nSo the number of middle rows is determined by the maximum number of rows any block spans. Or perhaps it's always two rows. Because in all training examples, the output uses two rows. Example0: two rows (1-2), example1: two rows (5-6), example2: two rows (2-3).\n\nAh, this makes sense. All outputs in the training examples have the non-zero blocks placed in two consecutive rows. Even though in example0, the blocks each spanned two rows, but in the output they are merged into two rows. So the pattern is: collapse all non-zero blocks into two middle rows, arranged left to right based on their original starting columns.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. For each row in the input, identify all horizontal blocks (contiguous same numbers).\n\n2. Collect all such blocks, noting their value, starting column, and the number of rows they appear in (vertical span).\n\n3. Sort the blocks in left to right order based on starting column.\n\n4. In the output, create two consecutive middle rows where all these blocks are placed left to right, merging their columns. If multiple blocks are in the same column range in these two rows, they are overwritten? Or somehow merged.\n\nWait, in example0's output, the two rows are identical. So each block is placed in the same columns across both rows. For example, 2s in columns1-2,4-5,7-8 in both rows1 and2. So the vertical span is maintained by duplicating the block across two rows. So even if a block was in a single row in the input, it appears in two rows in the output.\n\nBut how does that fit with the vertical span? For example, in example2's input, some blocks may have been in a single row, but in the output, they are in two rows.\n\nWait, example2's input has:\n\n- 2s in rows1 and2 (column3), but in row1 it's a single cell, row2 also a single cell. So it's two separate horizontal blocks. Or are they considered a vertical block?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical span is determined by how many consecutive rows the same column has the same number. For example, if a column has the same number in consecutive rows, that's part of a vertical span. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical span is ignored, and all blocks are placed into two rows in the output, regardless of their original vertical span. So even if a block was in a single row, it's placed in both rows of the output.\n\nLooking at example2's input:\n\nThe 1s are in rows2 and3 (columns1), but maybe as two separate horizontal blocks. But in the output, they are merged into two rows (rows2 and3), with the same value in columns1. Similarly for the 2s and4s.\n\nSo the process could be:\n\n- All horizontal blocks are collected, sorted left to right.\n\n- Each block is placed in two consecutive middle rows of the output, occupying their original columns. If a block was in a single row in the input, it's duplicated into both output rows.\n\nSo the key steps are:\n\n- Identify all horizontal blocks (contiguous same number in a row).\n\n- Sort them left to right based on starting column.\n\n- Place them in the two middle rows of the output, left to right, with their columns filled. Each block appears in both rows.\n\nFor example, in example0's input:\n\nThe blocks are:\n\nRow0: columns1-2 (2s)\n\nRow1: columns1-2 (2s), columns7-8 (1s)\n\nRow2: columns4-5 (4s), columns7-8 (1s)\n\nRow3: columns4-5 (4s)\n\nSo the blocks are:\n\n- 2s in columns1-2 (rows0-1)\n\n- 1s in columns7-8 (rows1-2)\n\n- 4s in columns4-5 (rows2-3)\n\nSorted by starting column: 2s (1), 4s (4), 1s (7).\n\nOutput rows1-2 have:\n\n[0,2,2,0,4,4,0,1,1,0]\n\n[0,2,2,0,4,4,0,1,1,0]\n\nSo the blocks are placed left to right, each spanning their columns, and duplicated in both rows.\n\nSimilarly, example1's output has all blocks placed in two rows, left to right.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nCollect all horizontal blocks (same number in a row, contiguous), sort them left to right by starting column, then in the output's two middle rows, place each block in its columns, duplicated in both rows. All other rows are zeros.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input has 10 rows. Middle two rows are 5 and6 (indices5 and6).\n\nThe horizontal blocks in the test input:\n\nRow0: columns8-9 (2s)\n\nRow1: columns8-9 (2s)\n\nRow2: columns1-2 (1s), column7 (2)\n\nRow3: columns1-2 (1s)\n\nRow4: column0 (1)\n\nRow5: columns4-5 (4s)\n\nRow6: columns4-5 (4s)\n\nRow7: column3 (4)\n\nSo the horizontal blocks are:\n\n- 2s in rows0-1, columns8-9 \u2192 two rows. But as horizontal blocks, each row has a block. So two separate blocks (row0 and row1 each have a block in columns8-9). Or are they considered a single block spanning two rows? This is ambiguous.\n\nBut according to the training examples, consecutive rows with the same number in the same columns are considered part of the same vertical block. For example, in example0, the 2s in rows0 and1 (same columns) form a vertical block, which is then placed in two rows of the output.\n\nBut according to the pattern I deduced earlier, it's about horizontal blocks in each row, which are then sorted and placed in the middle rows.\n\nSo for the test input, the horizontal blocks in each row are:\n\nRow0: 2s (8-9)\n\nRow1: 2s (8-9)\n\nRow2: 1s (1-2), 2 (7)\n\nRow3: 1s (1-2)\n\nRow4: 1 (0)\n\nRow5: 4s (4-5)\n\nRow6:4s (4-5)\n\nRow7:4 (3)\n\nOther rows are zeros.\n\nSo the horizontal blocks are:\n\nFrom row0: block 2s (8-9)\n\nrow1: block 2s (8-9)\n\nrow2: block 1s (1-2), block 2 (7)\n\nrow3: block 1s (1-2)\n\nrow4: block 1 (0)\n\nrow5: block 4s (4-5)\n\nrow6: block4s (4-5)\n\nrow7: block4 (3)\n\nNow, collect all these blocks and sort them by starting column:\n\nblock4 (row4, column0)\n\nblock1s (row2, column1)\n\nblock1s (row3, column1)\n\nblock4 (row7, column3)\n\nblock4s (row5, column4)\n\nblock4s (row6, column4)\n\nblock2 (row2, column7)\n\nblock2s (row0, column8)\n\nblock2s (row1, column8)\n\nSo sorted by starting column:\n\n0 (row4), 1 (row2, row3), 3 (row7),4 (row5, row6),7 (row2),8 (row0, row1).\n\nNow, merging these into the middle rows (5 and6), left to right.\n\nEach block will occupy their respective columns in rows5 and6. For example:\n\n- The block at column0 (row4) is a single 1 in column0. So in rows5 and6, column0 is 1.\n\n- The blocks at columns1-2 (rows2 and3) are 1s. So in rows5 and6, columns1-2 are 1s.\n\n- The block at column3 (row7) is a single 4. So column3 in rows5 and6 is4.\n\n- The blocks at columns4-5 (rows5 and6) are4s. So columns4-5 in rows5 and6 are4.\n\n- The block at column7 (row2) is a single2. So column7 in rows5 and6 is2.\n\n- The blocks at columns8-9 (rows0 and1) are2s. So columns8-9 in rows5 and6 are2s.\n\nSo the output rows5 and6 would be:\n\n[1,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2]\n\nWait, but let's reconstruct it step by step.\n\nStarting from left:\n\nColumn0: block4 (row4) has a 1. So in rows5 and6, column0 is1.\n\nColumns1-2: blocks from rows2 and3, which are 1s. So columns1-2 are1s.\n\nColumn3: block from row7, 4. So column3 is4.\n\nColumns4-5: blocks from rows5 and6, 4s. So columns4-5 are4s.\n\nColumn7: block from row2, 2. So column7 is2.\n\nColumns8-9: blocks from rows0 and1, 2s. So columns8-9 are2s.\n\nColumns6, and others between: 0.\n\nSo rows5 and6 would be:\n\nRow5: [1,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2]\n\nRow6: same as row5.\n\nOther rows are all zeros.\n\nLooking at the test input's structure, this seems plausible. But the test input's row4 has a 1 in column0. So this would be merged into the middle rows. The other rows (5-6) have 4s in columns4-5, which are also merged. The 2s from the top are in columns8-9.\n\nSo the final output would have rows5 and6 as described, and the rest zeros.\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the output often has multiple blocks in the same rows, arranged left to right. So the test input's output would be two rows (5 and6) with all the blocks arranged left to right, each in their respective columns.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe test input's output should be a 10-row grid where rows5 and6 are:\n\n[1,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2]\n\nAnd all other rows are zeros.\n\nBut wait, in example1's output, the blocks are arranged left to right even if their original positions were overlapping in columns. For example, in example1, the 2s, 1s, and4s are placed left to right without overlapping. So perhaps overlapping is not allowed, and they are placed consecutively. Wait, no. In example0's output, the 2s, 4s, and1s are placed in columns1-2,4-5,7-8. So they are spaced out, not overlapping. So each block is placed in their original columns.\n\nSo in the test input's case, the blocks are:\n\n- column0:1\n\n- columns1-2:1s\n\n- column3:4\n\n- columns4-5:4s\n\n- column7:2\n\n- columns8-9:2s\n\nThese columns don't overlap, so they can all be placed in the same rows. Thus, rows5 and6 would be:\n\n[1,1,1,4,4,4,0,2,2,2]\n\nYes. Because:\n\n- column0:1\n\n- columns1-2:1s\n\n- column3:4\n\n- columns4-5:4s\n\n- columns7:2 (single column)\n\n- columns8-9:2s.\n\nSo the row would look like:\n\n0: 1\n\n1-2: 1\n\n3:4\n\n4-5:4\n\n7:2\n\n8-9:2.\n\nBetween these, the other columns (6, for example) are zero.\n\nSo the output for the test input would have rows5 and6 filled as above, and all other rows zero.\n\nThus, the final answer should be a 10-row grid with rows5 and6 as described and the rest zeros.",
