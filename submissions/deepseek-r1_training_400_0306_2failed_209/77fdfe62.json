        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a grid of numbers, and the output is another grid, but smaller. The first step is to understand how the input grids are transformed into the output grids.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has 8 rows. The output has 4 rows. Let me check the numbers. The first input row is [2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3], and the output starts with [0, 2, 0, 0]. Hmm. Maybe the output is taking certain elements from the input. Let's look at the corners. The first input row starts with 2 and ends with 3. The output's first row starts with 0, then 2, then 0, then 0. Wait, maybe not corners. Let's look at the first and last rows of the input. The first input row is [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3], and the last row is [4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6]. The output's first two rows are [0,2,0,0] and [2,2,0,3]. Then the third and fourth rows of the output are [0,0,6,0] and [4,0,6,6]. I notice that 2 and 4 are from the first and last rows of the input, and 3 and 6 are from the ends as well. Maybe the output is combining elements from the first and last rows, and maybe other rows too. \n\nIn Example 0's output, the first element is 0. Where does that come from? Wait, maybe looking at the surrounding 8s in the input. For instance, the third row of input has [0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0]. Maybe the output is counting the number of 8s in certain regions? Or perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from the perimeter of the input grid and processing them somehow.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input is a 6x6 grid, and the output is 2x2. The input's first row is [9,1,0,0,1,4], and the output's first row is [9,4]. The last row of the input is [2,1,0,0,1,3], and the output's second row is [2,0]. Wait, the output here seems to be taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows. So 9 and 4 are the first and last elements of the first input row, and 2 and 3's output is [2,0]... Hmm, but in Example 1's output, the second row is [2,0], but the input's last row's last element is 3. Maybe not exactly that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the corners of the input grid. For Example 0, the input is 8x8. The four corners would be 2 (top-left), 3 (top-right), 4 (bottom-left), 6 (bottom-right). But the output isn't arranged as those four. Wait, in Example 0's output, the first two rows are [0,2,0,0], [2,2,0,3], then [0,0,6,0], [4,0,6,6]. Maybe it's not just corners. Let me check other elements.\n\nLooking at the input in Example 0, the rows in between the first and last have 8s. For example, the third row has an 8 at position 4 (0-indexed), the fourth row has two 8s. Maybe the output is combining the numbers from the borders and the count of 8s in certain quadrants?\n\nWait, perhaps the output grid is formed by taking the first and last elements of each row in the input, but only for certain rows. Let's see. Example 0's input has 8 rows. The output has 4 rows. Maybe the output is combining pairs of rows. For instance, the first two rows of the output could be based on the first and last rows of the input. Then the next two rows could be from the middle rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by dividing the input grid into quadrants and processing each quadrant. For example, splitting the input into top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right. Then for each quadrant, some operation is performed. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is 8x8. Splitting into four 4x4 quadrants. The output is 4x4. Each quadrant of the input becomes a row in the output? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for each example. Example 0's output has four rows. Each row in the output may correspond to a pair of rows from the input. Let's check the input rows and see how they map to output rows.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]\n\nRow 7: [4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6]\n\nThe output's first row is [0,2,0,0]. Hmm. Not obvious. Alternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the first and last rows and some from the middle rows.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the input has 6 rows. The output is 2 rows. The first output row is [9,4], which are the first and last elements of the first input row. The second output row is [2,0]. The last input row is [2,1,0,0,1,3], so the first element is 2, last is 3. But the output is [2,0]. So maybe not directly taking first and last. Alternatively, maybe the output rows are the first and last elements of the first and last input rows. But 9 and 4 are from the first row, and 2 and 3 from the last, but in output, the second row is [2,0]. That doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: looking for the presence of 8s. In Example 0, the input has several 8s in the middle rows. The output has numbers like 6, which could be the count of 8s in certain regions. For example, the third row of the output in Example 0 is [0,0,6,0], and the fourth row has [4,0,6,6]. Maybe the 6s are counts of 8s. Let's check. In the input for Example 0, rows 3 and 4 have 8s. Row 3: [0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0] \u2192 three 8s. Row 4: [0,1,0,0,8,0,1,0] \u2192 one 8. Row 5: [0,1,8,0,8,8,1,0] \u2192 three 8s. So total 3+1+3=7? Not sure. But the output has 6 in some positions. Maybe each quadrant's count of 8s. Let's split the input into quadrants. For Example 0's input, which is 8x8, the top-left quadrant is rows 0-3 and columns 0-3. The top-right is rows 0-3, columns 4-7. Bottom-left is rows 4-7, columns 0-3. Bottom-right is rows 4-7, columns 4-7. For each quadrant, count the 8s. Let's compute that.\n\nTop-left quadrant of Example 0's input: rows 0-3, columns 0-3.\n\nRows:\n\nRow 0: [2,1,0,0] \u2192 no 8s.\n\nRow 1: [1,1,1,1] \u2192 no 8s.\n\nRow 2: [0,1,0,8] \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow 3: [0,1,8,8] \u2192 two 8s.\n\nTotal in top-left: 0+0+1+2=3.\n\nTop-right quadrant (columns 4-7):\n\nRow 0: [0,0,1,3] \u2192 no 8s.\n\nRow 1: [1,1,1,1] \u2192 no 8s.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,1,0] \u2192 no 8s.\n\nRow 3: [0,8,1,0] \u2192 one 8.\n\nTotal top-right: 1.\n\nBottom-left (rows 4-7, columns 0-3):\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0] \u2192 no 8s.\n\nRow5: [0,1,8,0] \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow6: [1,1,1,1] \u2192 no 8s.\n\nRow7: [4,1,0,0] \u2192 no 8s.\n\nTotal: 1.\n\nBottom-right (columns 4-7):\n\nRow4: [8,0,1,0] \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow5: [8,8,1,0] \u2192 two 8s.\n\nRow6: [1,1,1,1] \u2192 no.\n\nRow7: [0,0,1,6] \u2192 no.\n\nTotal: 1+2=3.\n\nIf each quadrant's count of 8s is part of the output, but the output for Example0 is:\n\n[0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 0, 3]\n\n[0, 0, 6, 0]\n\n[4, 0, 6, 6]\n\nHmm, those numbers don't directly match the counts (3,1,1,3). So maybe not counts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of 8s in each quadrant multiplied by something. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows, and combining them in some way. For example, Example0's first row has 2 and 3. Last row has 4 and 6. Then maybe the output's first two rows are combinations of these numbers. The first output row is [0,2,0,0]. The second is [2,2,0,3]. The third row is [0,0,6,0], and fourth is [4,0,6,6]. The 2,3,4,6 are present here, but with other numbers. Maybe the output is built from the perimeter elements and some other processing.\n\nAnother approach: notice that in the input grids, the first and last elements of the first and last rows are often present in the output. For Example0, input first row starts with 2 and ends with 3, last row starts with4 and ends with6. These numbers (2,3,4,6) appear in the output. But how?\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\n[0,2,0,0] \u2192 2 is from the first row start.\n\n[2,2,0,3] \u2192 2 and 3.\n\n[0,0,6,0] \u2192 6 from last row end.\n\n[4,0,6,6] \u21924 and6.\n\nSo maybe the output is a combination of elements from the perimeter, and the numbers in the output are either 0 or the perimeter numbers, arranged in some pattern.\n\nWait, maybe each output row corresponds to two input rows, merging them in some way. For example, the first output row could be combining the first and second input rows, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the input grid has a border of 1s. In Example0's input, the second row is all 1s, and the seventh row is all 1s. Similarly, in Example1, the second and fifth rows are all 1s. The rows with all 1s might be acting as separators. So between these 1s rows, there are regions with 8s. Maybe the output is summarizing the regions between the 1s.\n\nIn Example0, the input has two rows of 1s (rows 1 and 6). The regions between them are rows 2-5. These rows have 8s. The output might be capturing the 8s in these regions. For example, the third and fourth output rows in Example0 are [0,0,6,0] and [4,0,6,6]. The 6 could relate to the number of 8s. Let's count the 8s in rows 2-5 of Example0's input.\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0] \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0] \u2192 three 8s.\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,8,0,1,0] \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow5: [0,1,8,0,8,8,1,0] \u2192 three 8s.\n\nTotal 8s: 1+3+1+3=8. But the output has a 6. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the output is capturing the 8s in each quadrant of these middle rows. For Example0, the middle rows (2-5) form a 4-row section. Maybe each output row after the first two is processing these.\n\nAlternatively, the output is divided into four parts, each corresponding to a quadrant of the input, and the values are the sum or count of certain elements. But I'm not seeing the connection.\n\nLooking at the Test Input. It's a 10x10 grid. The output will need to be smaller. Let's think about how the training examples' input sizes relate to their output sizes. Example0: 8x8 input \u2192 4x4 output. Example1: 6x6 input \u2192 2x2 output. Example2: 8x8 input \u2192 4x4 output. So the output size is half the input size in each dimension? For 8x8 input, output is 4x4. For 6x6 input, output is 2x2. Wait, 6/2=3, but the output is 2x2. So maybe not exactly. Alternatively, the output dimensions are (input_rows / 2 - 1) or something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking every other row and column. But Example0's input is 8 rows, output is 4. So taking every other row. Similarly for columns. But looking at the Test Input which is 10 rows, so output would be 5 rows? But in the examples, 8 rows \u2192 4, 6 \u2192 2. So 10 \u2192 5? But the outputs in examples 0 and 2 are 4 rows, which is (8 rows - 4)/something. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example1's input: 6 rows. Output is 2 rows. So 6 rows \u2192 output rows = (6-2)/2 = 2. Similarly, 8 rows \u2192 (8-4)/2=2, but examples 0 and 2 have 4 output rows. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first and last rows, and other specific rows. But not sure.\n\nLet me try a different angle. Let's look at the positions of the numbers in the output and see where they come from in the input.\n\nExample0's output:\n\nFirst row: [0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nSecond row: [2, 2, 0, 3]\n\nThird row: [0, 0, 6, 0]\n\nFourth row: [4, 0, 6, 6]\n\nPossible sources:\n\nThe 2 in the first row's second position is from the first input row's first element (2). The 3 in the second row's last position is from the first input row's last element (3). The 6 in the third row's third position is from the last input row's last element (6). The 4 in the fourth row's first position is from the last input row's first element (4). The 6s in the fourth row's third and fourth positions are from the last element (6). \n\nSo maybe the output is a combination of the corners of the input, but arranged in a certain way. For example, the top-left corner (2) is in the first row, second column of the output. The top-right corner (3) is in the second row's last column. The bottom-left (4) is in the fourth row's first column. The bottom-right (6) is in the third and fourth rows' third and fourth columns. \n\nBut how? It's not a straightforward mapping. Maybe the output is a spiral or some pattern that involves moving around the perimeter of the input grid and collecting elements. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother observation: the output in Example0 has numbers that are the same as the corners and some other elements. For example, the second row has [2,2,0,3]. The first 2 could be from the first row's first element, the second 2 from the second row's first element (which is 1 in input, so that doesn't fit). Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example0's input, the first row is [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. The second row is all 1s. Maybe the output is ignoring rows that are all 1s, and focusing on other rows. So the first and last rows (non-1s rows) are part of the output. Then the middle rows with 8s are processed in some way.\n\nIn Example0's output, the first two rows are based on the first and last input rows (excluding the all-1s rows). Let's see:\n\nFirst input row: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]\n\nLast input row: [4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6]\n\nIn the output, the first two rows are:\n\n[0,2,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,3]\n\nThen the next two rows are:\n\n[0,0,6,0]\n\n[4,0,6,6]\n\nHmm, maybe the output is created by taking the first and last elements of the non-1s rows and combining them. For example, for each pair of rows (first and last, then the next pair), take their first and last elements and arrange them in some way.\n\nAnother thought: The output in Example0 has four rows, each with four elements. The input has 8 rows and 8 columns. Maybe each output element is the sum of two input elements. For example, output[0][0] = input[0][0] + input[7][0] \u2192 2 +4 =6. But the output[0][0] is 0, which doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, output elements are the differences between certain input elements. Or maybe the output is constructed by taking the non-1 elements from the perimeter and arranging them.\n\nIn Example0's input, the perimeter elements (first row, last row, first and last columns) have numbers like 2,3,4,6. The output seems to include these numbers. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\nRow0: 0,2,0,0\n\nRow1:2,2,0,3\n\nRow2:0,0,6,0\n\nRow3:4,0,6,6\n\nThe 2,3,4,6 are present, but how are they arranged? For example, the 2 from the first row's start is in row0's position 1. The 3 from the first row's end is in row1's position3. The 4 from the last row's start is in row3's position0. The6 from the last row's end is in row2's position2 and row3's positions2 and3.\n\nThis seems a bit random. Maybe the output is built by rotating or mirroring parts of the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a compressed version of the input where certain elements are summed or concatenated. For example, combining two rows into one by adding elements or taking the maximum. For instance, the first output row could be combining input row0 and row7. Let's see:\n\nInput row0: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]\n\nInput row7: [4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6]\n\nIf we combine them by taking the first element of row0 and row7: 2 and4 \u2192 but output row0 is [0,2,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking elements from the first and last rows, alternating between them. For example, first element from row0, next from row7, etc. But not sure.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is formed by considering the numbers at the positions where the 1s are in the input. For example, in the input, the 1s form a border. The numbers outside this border (the very first and last elements) are part of the output. The numbers inside the 1s border (the middle part) are processed based on the 8s.\n\nWait, in Example0's input, the first row is [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. The 1s are in positions1 and6. The elements outside are 2 and3. Similarly, the last row is [4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6], with elements4 and6 outside the 1s. Then the output might take these outer elements and then process the inner regions (the parts between the 1s) which contain 8s.\n\nSo for each row, the elements outside the 1s (the first and last elements) are taken, and the inner elements (between the 1s) are processed to count 8s or something. Let's explore this.\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nFirst row: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3] \u2192 outer elements 2 and3.\n\nLast row: [4,1,0,0,0,0,1,6] \u2192 outer elements4 and6.\n\nThese appear in the output's first two rows and last two rows.\n\nThen, for the inner rows (rows2-5), between the 1s. Each of these rows starts and ends with 0, and has 1s in positions1 and6. The inner part (columns2-5) contain 8s. So maybe the output's third and fourth rows are processing these inner regions.\n\nFor example, in row2 of input: columns2-5 are [0,8,0,0]. So there's one 8 here.\n\nRow3: columns2-5 are [8,8,0,8] \u2192 three 8s.\n\nRow4: columns2-5 are [0,0,8,0] \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow5: columns2-5 are [8,0,8,8] \u2192 three 8s.\n\nIf we sum the 8s in each column across these rows:\n\nColumns2: 0 (row2) +8 (row3) +0 (row4) +8 (row5) = 16? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output's third and fourth rows represent the count of 8s in the left and right halves of these inner regions. Let's see:\n\nFor Example0's inner rows (rows2-5):\n\nEach row's inner part (columns2-5) is four elements. Split into two halves: left two and right two.\n\nRow2: [0,8 | 0,0] \u2192 left has 1 eight.\n\nRow3: [8,8 | 0,8] \u2192 left 2 eights, right 1.\n\nRow4: [0,0 |8,0] \u2192 left 0, right 1.\n\nRow5: [8,0 |8,8] \u2192 left 1, right 2.\n\nTotal left eights: 1+2+0+1=4. Total right eights: 1+1+2=4 (Wait, row3 right has 1, row4 right has1, row5 right has2. Total 4? So maybe the output's third row is 4 and 4, but in Example0's output, the third row is [0,0,6,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows for the inner region are combining the left and right counts. But not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s form connected regions. For example, in Example0's input, the 8s form a sort of shape, and the output captures the count of 8s in each quadrant. But earlier counts didn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output is built by taking the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows, and then for the middle rows, the number of 8s in specific positions.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the Test Input. The first row is [3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4]. The last row is [7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5]. So the outer elements are3,4,7,5. These would probably appear in the output. Then, the middle rows have 8s. For example, rows2-7 have 8s. The output would likely have elements derived from these 8s.\n\nIn the Training Examples, the outputs seem to have the first and last elements of the first and last rows, and then some processing of the 8s. For example, in Example0's output, the numbers 2,3,4,6 are present from the outer elements, and there are 6s which could be related to the 8s. Similarly, in Example1's output, the numbers 9,4,2,3 (but output is [9,4] and [2,0]). Wait, in Example1's last input row, the first element is2 and last is3. The output's second row is [2,0]. Maybe the 0 comes from the middle rows' 8s processing.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the outer elements and some count or sum of the 8s in certain regions.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n\nFirst row: [3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4] \u2192 outer elements3 and4.\n\nLast row: [7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5] \u2192 outer elements7 and5.\n\nThe middle rows (2-7) have various 8s. For example, row2: [0,1,0,8,8,0,0,0,1,0] \u2192 8s at columns3 and4.\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,8,8,0,8,0,1,0] \u2192 8s at 2,3,4,6.\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,8,0,8,0,1,0] \u21928s at4,6.\n\nRow5: [0,1,0,8,0,8,8,0,1,0] \u21928s at3,5,6.\n\nRow6: [0,1,8,8,0,8,0,8,1,0] \u21928s at2,3,5,7.\n\nRow7: [0,1,0,8,0,0,8,0,1,0] \u21928s at3,6.\n\nSo how are these 8s processed? Maybe each output row after the first two is summing the 8s in certain columns or rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows and arranging them, and then for the middle rows, counting the number of 8s in each quadrant.\n\nLet's try applying this to Example0. The first and last elements of the first row are 2 and3. The first and last of the last row are4 and6. Then the output's first two rows are:\n\n[0,2,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,3]\n\nBut how does 2 and3 become 0,2,0,0 and 2,2,0,3? It's not clear. Maybe these numbers are being rotated or mirrored.\n\nAlternatively, the output is built by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows, and the numbers in between are derived from the 8s. For example, the 6 in the output could be the count of 8s in a certain region. In Example0's output, there are multiple 6s. Let's count the total number of 8s in Example0's input: row2:1, row3:3, row4:1, row5:3 \u2192 total 8. But the output has 6s. Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the third row is [0,0,6,0], and the fourth row has [4,0,6,6]. The 6 appears three times. So 6 could be the total number of 8s in some area. Let's see. For Example0's input, total 8s are 1+3+1+3=8. Not 6. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s in certain rows. For example, in Example0's input, the middle rows (2-5) have 8s. Row3 has three 8s, row5 has three. So 3+3=6. That could explain the 6s in the output. But how does that fit into the output structure?\n\nIn Example0's output, the third row is [0,0,6,0]. The fourth row has [4,0,6,6]. So maybe the 6s are the count of 8s in rows3 and5. Then 3+3=6. So perhaps the output's third and fourth rows are handling that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows, then for the remaining elements, it's the count of 8s in the corresponding quadrant. Let's see:\n\nFor Example0's output:\n\nFirst two rows: derived from first and last rows of input.\n\nThird and fourth rows: derived from middle rows.\n\nIf the output's third row is [0,0,6,0], perhaps the 6 is the count of 8s in the bottom-right quadrant. Let's check.\n\nExample0's input bottom-right quadrant is rows4-7, columns4-7. Row4: [0,0,1,0] \u2192 no 8s. Row5: [8,8,1,0] \u2192 two 8s. Row6: [1,1,1,1] \u2192 no. Row7: [0,0,1,6] \u2192 no. So total 2. But the output has 6. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the entire middle region (rows2-5, columns2-5) in Example0's input. Let's count 8s in that area. row2 columns2-5: 0,8,0,0 \u2192 1. row3:8,8,0,8 \u21923. row4:0,0,8,0 \u21921. row5:8,0,8,8 \u21923. Total 8s:1+3+1+3=8. Again, not 6.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,3]\n\nRow2: [0,0,6,0]\n\nRow3: [4,0,6,6]\n\nNotice that the numbers 2,3,4,6 are from the first and last rows. The 6 appears in positions related to the last element of the last row. The 2 appears in positions related to the first element of the first row. The 3 is from the last element of the first row. The 4 is from the first element of the last row.\n\nThe 6s in row3's third and fourth positions could be related to the last element of the last row (6), perhaps duplicated. The 0s might represent areas where there are no 8s, or where certain conditions are not met.\n\nAnother thought: The output is a combination of the perimeter elements and the sum of 8s in each quadrant. For example, the first two rows of the output are perimeter elements arranged in a certain way, and the last two rows are sum of 8s in each quadrant. But earlier counts didn't align.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows, and then for each pair of rows in between, some operation is performed. For example, Example0 has 8 rows. After the first and last, there are rows2-5. Maybe these are grouped into pairs and processed.\n\nIn Example0's input, rows2-5:\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,8,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,8,8,0,8,1,0]\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,8,0,1,0]\n\nRow5: [0,1,8,0,8,8,1,0]\n\nGrouped into pairs (2-3 and4-5). For each pair, maybe the sum of 8s. For rows2-3:1+3=4. For rows4-5:1+3=4. But Example0's output has 6 in some places. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows correspond to the input's rows with 8s, and the numbers are the count of 8s in those rows. For Example0's input rows2-5: 1,3,1,3. So sum would be 8. But output has 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: the output for each example seems to have the same number of rows as the number of pairs of 1s rows. For Example0, there are two 1s rows (row1 and row6). So the output has four rows. Wait, no. Example0's output has four rows, but the input has two 1s rows. Maybe the output rows are the number of 1s rows minus one. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the non-1s rows and processing them. For Example0, the non-1s rows are rows0,2-5,7. That's six rows, but output has four. Hmm.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to look for a pattern in the output arrays themselves. For Example0's output:\n\nFirst row: 0,2,0,0\n\nSecond row:2,2,0,3\n\nThird row:0,0,6,0\n\nFourth row:4,0,6,6\n\nThe numbers 2,3,4,6 are the corners of the input grid. The 0s are in positions where there's no corresponding element from the corners. The 6 appears in the third and fourth rows. Maybe the output is built by placing the corner elements in certain positions and filling the rest with counts of 8s.\n\nFor example:\n\n- The first output row's second element is the top-left corner (2), and the last output row's first element is the bottom-left corner (4). The second output row's first and second elements are 2 (top-left), and last element is3 (top-right). The third output row's third element is6 (bottom-right), and the fourth row's third and fourth elements are6 (bottom-right).\n\nThen, the 0s are where there are no corners, and the 6s could be the count of 8s in certain areas. For example, the third row's 6 is the count of 8s in the middle region. But earlier counts didn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, the 6 in Example0's output might be derived from the sum of the bottom-right corner (6) and some other number. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In the output, the numbers from the corners are placed in a diamond-like pattern. For Example0, the 2 is in row0, column1; row1, column0 and1. The3 is in row1, column3. The4 is in row3, column0. The6 is in row2, column2; row3, column2 and3.\n\nThis resembles a diamond shape. Maybe the output is arranging the corner elements in a diamond pattern, with the corners positioned in specific places. The numbers in between are filled with 0s. The 6s could be a sum of the bottom-right and top-left, but 2+6=8, not 6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the 6 is the sum of the bottom-right (6) and some other element. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: The output is constructed by rotating the corners. For example, the top-left (2) moves to the right, top-right (3) moves down, bottom-right (6) moves left, and bottom-left (4) moves up. Then, the 6 could be duplicated in certain positions. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by creating a new grid where each element is taken from the input grid based on a certain pattern. For example, the output's first row is made from the first row of the input, but only every other element starting from the second position. But in Example0's input first row, that would be [1,0,0,1], which doesn't match the output's first row [0,2,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nPerhaps the output is built by taking the first and last elements of certain rows and columns and interleaving them. For instance, in Example0's input:\n\nFirst row's first element (2) and last element (3) \u2192 appears in output's first and second rows.\n\nLast row's first (4) and last (6) \u2192 appear in output's third and fourth rows.\n\nThen the middle rows' elements are processed based on the 8s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, maybe I need to look for another pattern. Let's check the Test Input's expected output. It's a 10x10 grid. The output will likely be a 5x4 grid? Or perhaps 4 rows. The Training Examples suggest that the output's row count is roughly half the input's row count. For example, 8 rows \u21924, 6 \u21922, 8\u21924. Test Input is 10 rows \u2192 output might be5 rows. But the examples' outputs don't exactly halve. For example, 8 rows become 4, which is exactly half. 6 becomes2 (which is 6/3). So maybe the output rows are input rows divided by 2.\n\nTest Input has 10 rows \u2192 output should have5 rows. Let's see.\n\nThe Test Input's first row is [3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4], last row is [7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5]. The outer elements are3,4,7,5. The middle rows (2-7) have various 8s. Following the pattern from the training examples, the output would likely include these outer elements and process the 8s.\n\nLooking at Example0's output, the first two rows are based on the outer elements. Let's assume the Test Output's first two rows will be based on3,4,7,5. Then the next rows will process the 8s.\n\nIn Example0, the first output row is [0,2,0,0], and the second is [2,2,0,3]. For the Test Input, maybe the first row would be [0,3,0,0], and the second [3,3,0,4]. Then the third and fourth rows would be related to the 8s and the last row's elements.\n\nBut how to process the 8s. Maybe the number of 8s in each quadrant or region. For the Test Input's middle rows (rows2-7), they contain 8s. Let's count the 8s in these rows:\n\nRow2: 2 (positions3 and4)\n\nRow3:4 (positions2,3,4,6)\n\nRow4:2 (positions4 and6)\n\nRow5:3 (positions3,5,6)\n\nRow6:4 (positions2,3,5,7)\n\nRow7:2 (positions3 and6)\n\nTotal 8s:2+4+2+3+4+2=17. Not sure how this would translate into output numbers.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows after the first two are formed by counting the number of 8s in each column of the middle rows. For example, for each column in the middle rows, count how many times 8 appears. Then, these counts are arranged into the output.\n\nFor the Test Input's middle rows (rows2-7, columns0-9):\n\nColumns0: all 0s (rows2-7) \u2192 count 0.\n\nColumn1: all 1s \u2192 0.\n\nColumn2: row2 is0, row3 is8, row4 is0, row5 is0, row6 is8, row7 is0 \u2192 total 2.\n\nColumn3: row2 is8, row3 is8, row4 is0, row5 is8, row6 is8, row7 is8 \u2192 5.\n\nColumn4: row2 is8, row3 is8, row4 is8, row5 is0, row6 is0, row7 is0 \u2192 3.\n\nColumn5: row2 is0, row3 is0, row4 is0, row5 is8, row6 is8, row7 is0 \u21922.\n\nColumn6: row2 is0, row3 is8, row4 is8, row5 is8, row6 is0, row7 is8 \u21924.\n\nColumn7: row2 is0, row3 is0, row4 is0, row5 is0, row6 is8, row7 is0 \u21921.\n\nColumns8: all 1s \u21920.\n\nColumn9: all 0s \u21920.\n\nSo counts per column: [0,0,2,5,3,2,4,1,0,0].\n\nBut how would this be arranged into the output? The output for Example0 has 4 rows. Maybe for the Test Input, the output will have 5 rows, each corresponding to a pair of columns from these counts. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output's later rows sum the counts in specific ways. For example, the third row could be the sum of columns2 and3 (2+5=7), and column4 and5 (3+2=5). But this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I'm not entirely sure about the exact pattern. But based on the training examples, the output seems to include the first and last elements of the first and last input rows, arranged in a particular pattern, followed by numbers derived from the 8s in the middle rows.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n\nFirst row: [3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4] \u2192 outer elements3 and4.\n\nLast row: [7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5] \u2192 outer elements7 and5.\n\nAssuming the output starts with rows that include these numbers, similar to the training examples. For example, first output row: [0,3,0,0], second row: [3,3,0,4]. Then, the next rows would involve processing the 8s. \n\nBut in Example0, the output also includes the bottom-left and bottom-right elements (4 and6) in the last two rows. So for the Test Input, the last two rows might include7 and5, possibly in a similar pattern.\n\nThe middle rows' processing might involve the sum of 8s in certain regions. For Example0's output, the 6 appears three times. Maybe for the Test Input, the sum of certain 8 counts would be 17, but it's unclear how this would be formatted.\n\nAlternatively, the output is built by taking the first and last elements of each row in the input, excluding the all-1s rows, and then combining them. For Example0, the input has rows0 and7 as non-1s, so their elements are taken. Then, the middle rows' first and last elements are processed. But in Example0's output, the third row starts with0 and has6, which might come from the middle rows' first and last elements, which are all 0s and 0s. So maybe not.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not fully cracking the pattern, I'll make an educated guess based on the following observations from the training examples:\n\n- The output includes the first and last elements of the first and last input rows, arranged in a specific diamond-like pattern.\n- The middle part of the output is derived from the count of 8s in certain quadrants or regions of the input's middle rows.\n- The numbers in the output are either the corner elements or counts related to 8s.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\nThe first and last elements are3,4,7,5. These would form the first two rows of the output. For example:\n\n[0,3,0,0]\n\n[3,3,0,4]\n\nThen, the middle rows of the output would involve counts of 8s. Given the Test Input's middle rows have a total of17 8s, but how to distribute this into the output rows? Maybe the counts are divided into quadrants. For example, the middle region (rows2-7, columns2-7) could be split into quadrants, and each quadrant's 8 count is summed.\n\nFor the Test Input's middle region (rows2-7, columns2-7):\n\nTop-left quadrant: rows2-4, columns2-4.\n\nRows2: [0,8,8]\n\nRows3: [8,8,8]\n\nRows4: [0,0,8]\n\nCount: rows2 has two 8s, row3 has three, row4 has one. Total:6.\n\nTop-right quadrant: rows2-4, columns5-7.\n\nRows2: [0,0,0]\n\nRows3: [0,8,0]\n\nRows4: [0,8,0]\n\nCount: row3 has one, row4 has one. Total:2.\n\nBottom-left: rows5-7, columns2-4.\n\nRows5: [0,8,0]\n\nRows6: [8,8,0]\n\nRows7: [0,8,0]\n\nCount: row5 has one, row6 has two, row7 has one. Total:4.\n\nBottom-right: rows5-7, columns5-7.\n\nRows5: [8,8,0]\n\nRows6: [8,0,8]\n\nRows7: [0,8,0]\n\nCount: row5 has two, row6 has two, row7 has one. Total:5.\n\nSo the quadrants have counts 6,2,4,5. These numbers might appear in the output's middle rows. For example, the third row could be [0,0,5,0], and the fourth row [7,0,5,5]. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output's third and fourth rows would combine these counts in some way. For Example0, the counts in quadrants were3,1,1,3, which became6 in the output. Maybe the sum of top and bottom quadrants. For example, 6 (top-left) +4 (bottom-left) =10, and 2 (top-right) +5 (bottom-right) =7. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each output row after the first two corresponds to a pair of quadrants. For example, the third row could be [6,2], and the fourth [4,5]. But the output examples have four elements per row.\n\nAt this point, I think the most plausible pattern is that the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows and arranging them in a diamond-like pattern, with the numbers in between derived from the count of 8s in specific regions. However, without a clear formula, it's challenging. \n\nGiven the time I've invested and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nFor the Test Input's output:\n\n- The first row includes the top-left (3) and top-right (4) from the first input row.\n- The second row includes the bottom-left (7) and bottom-right (5) from the last input row.\n- The middle rows are derived from the count of 8s in specific quadrants.\n\nBut looking at the examples, the output rows are more than just the corners. For Example1's output:\n\nInput is 6x6. Output is 2x2. The first row is [9,4], which are the first and last elements of the first input row. The second row is [2,0], which are the first element of the last input row (2) and possibly a count of 8s. In Example1's input, there are two middle rows (rows2 and3) with 8s. Row2 has two 8s, row3 has one. Total 3. But output is [2,0]. So maybe the second number is the count of 8s in one of the quadrants.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, I'll make an educated guess for the Test Input's output based on the pattern observed in the examples, even if I can't fully explain it.\n\nLooking at the Test Input's first and last rows:\n\nFirst row: [3,1,...,1,4] \u2192 3 and4.\n\nLast row: [7,1,...,1,5] \u21927 and5.\n\nAssuming the output starts with these numbers arranged similarly to Example0's output:\n\nFirst output row: [0,3,0,0]\n\nSecond row: [3,3,0,4]\n\nThen, for the middle rows, perhaps the count of 8s in certain quadrants. If the middle rows have a total of17 8s, maybe they are split into 7 and 10, but how? \n\nAlternatively, the output's third row could be [0,0,5,0], fourth row [7,0,5,5], and fifth row [7,7,5,0], similar to Example2's structure.\n\nBut given that the Test Input has 10 rows and the output examples with 8 rows have 4 output rows, perhaps the Test Input's output will have5 rows. However, the training examples' output sizes don't follow a strict ratio. \n\nIn Example2, the input is 8x8, output is 4x4. The output includes elements from the first and last rows and middle rows. For the Test Input, maybe the output will have5 rows, but given the examples, perhaps it's 4 rows.\n\nConsidering all this, I'll proceed to structure the output as follows, taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows, and arranging them in a diamond pattern, with the 8s counts leading to other numbers.\n\nFinal guess for Test Output:\n\n[3,4]\n\n[7,5]\n\nBut in Example1, the output is two rows for a 6x6 input. So maybe for a 10x10 input, the output is 2 rows. But this conflicts with Example0 and 2 where 8x8 input gives 4 rows. So perhaps the output size depends on the number of 1s rows. The Test Input has two rows of all 1s (rows1 and8). The middle rows are2-7. So maybe the output has (number of middle rows) /2 = (6)/2=3 rows. But the examples don't align with this. Example0 has middle rows2-5 (4 rows), output has two middle rows. So 4/2=2.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Given the time I've spent and the pressure to answer, I'll proceed with the following output based on the Test Input's corners and a possible pattern similar to Example2:\n\nThe output will have four rows, with the corners arranged as follows:\n\nFirst row: [0,3,0,0]\n\nSecond row: [3,3,0,4]\n\nThird row: [0,0,5,0]\n\nFourth row: [7,0,5,5]\n\nBut this is a guess. Alternatively, considering the Test Input's 8s counts in the middle rows, the numbers could be higher. However, without a clear pattern, it's challenging. I'll proceed with a response that mirrors the structure of the training examples, particularly Example0 and Example2, which have similar inputs.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input grids and their corresponding outputs. The goal is to find out how the inputs are transformed into the outputs and apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at the first example (Example 0). The input is an 8x8 grid, and the output is a 4x4 grid. Hmm. So maybe the output is a quarter of the size, like each dimension is halved? Let me check. The original input has 8 elements per row, and the output has 4, so each row is split into two parts? Wait, but how exactly?\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 0:\n\nInput starts with [2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3]. The output's first row is [0, 2, 0, 0]. Hmm. Wait, maybe the grid is divided into quadrants or blocks, and each output cell is derived from a block in the input. For an 8x8 input, the output is 4x4, so each 2x2 block in the input becomes one element in the output. Let's see if that holds.\n\nTake the first input row: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. If we split this into 4 blocks of two elements each: [2,1], [0,0], [0,0], [1,3]. But the first output row is [0,2,0,0]. How does that relate? Not sure. Maybe looking at the entire grid structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from the corners and certain positions. Let's check the positions of the non-zero elements in the input and see how they map to the output.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row of the input starts with 2 and ends with 3. The output's first row is [0,2,0,0]. Wait, maybe the first and last elements of certain rows are being captured. Or perhaps it's the perimeter of the grid that's being considered.\n\nAnother approach: looking for 8s in the input. In Example 0's input, there are 8s in the third and fourth rows. The output has 6s in the third and fourth rows. For example, the third output row is [0,0,6,0], and the fourth is [4,0,6,6]. Maybe the 8s are being counted in some way. Let's check.\n\nIn the third input row of Example 0: [0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0]. The number of 8s here is 1. The third output row for this example is [0,0,6,0]. Not sure how 1 becomes 6. Alternatively, maybe the sum of 8s in each 2x2 block? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the third and fourth rows of Example 0's input:\n\nRow 3: [0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRow 4: [0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 8, 1, 0]\nRow 5: [0, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0]\nRow 6: [0, 1, 8, 0, 8, 8, 1, 0]\n\nIf we split these into 2x2 blocks, maybe each block contributes to the output. For example, in the third and fourth rows, columns 3-4 have 0 and 8 in row3, 8 and 8 in row4. So the sum of 8s in this 2x2 block would be 3 (since 0,8,8,8). Wait, but that's 3 8s. The output's third row, third element is 6. Hmm. Maybe 3 times 2 is 6. But that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are being counted in each quadrant. For example, the input is divided into four quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) and the count of 8s in each quadrant is taken. But in Example 0's output, the third and fourth rows have 6s. Wait, maybe the output is combining multiple elements.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the first and last elements of the input rows. In Example 0's input, the first row starts with 2 and ends with 3. The output's first row starts with 0 and has 2 in the second position. The output's last row starts with 4 and ends with 6. The input's last row starts with 4 and ends with 6. So maybe the first and last elements of certain rows in the input become elements in the output. But how?\n\nWait, in Example 0's output:\n\nThe first output row is [0, 2, 0, 0]. The input's first row is [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. The 2 is in the first position, and 3 is the last. But the output has 2 in the second position and 0s elsewhere. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1. Input is a 6x6 grid, output is 2x2. So again, perhaps each dimension is divided by 3 (since 6/3=2?), but 6 divided by 2 would be 3, but the output is 2x2. Hmm. Let's see. The input has 6 rows and 6 columns, output is 2 rows, 2 columns. So maybe each 3x3 block becomes one element. Wait, but 6/3=2. That could fit. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1's input:\n\nFirst input row is [9, 1, 0, 0, 1, 4]. The output's first row is [9,4]. The last element of the first input row is 4. So maybe the first and last elements of certain rows are taken. The first row's first and last elements are 9 and 4, which correspond to the first output row [9,4]. Similarly, the last input row is [2,1,0,0,1,3], and the output's last row is [2,0]. Wait, no. The last input row is [2,1,0,0,1,3], but the output's last row is [2,0]. Hmm, so 2 is the first element of the last input row, and maybe 0 comes from somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the corners of the input. For Example 1, the input is 6x6. The four corners would be 9 (top-left), 4 (top-right), 2 (bottom-left), 3 (bottom-right). But the output is [9,4] and [2,0]. Wait, that doesn't fit. The bottom-right corner is 3, but the output's second element in the second row is 0. So that can't be it.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's output: The output has four rows. The first row's elements are 0,2,0,0. The second row is 2,2,0,3. Third is 0,0,6,0. Fourth is 4,0,6,6. Maybe the numbers in the output are combinations of numbers from the input. For instance, the 6s could be related to the number of 8s in certain regions.\n\nIn Example 0's input, there are several 8s in the middle rows. Let's count the 8s in each quadrant. If we split the input into four quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), each being 4x4. Then count the 8s in each quadrant. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input for Example 0 is 8x8. The top-left quadrant is rows 0-3, columns 0-3. The top-right is rows 0-3, columns 4-7. Similarly for the bottom halves.\n\nLooking for 8s in the top-left quadrant: in rows 3 and 4 (maybe?), but need to check. Wait, row indices start from 0. Let's list the rows:\n\nRow 0: [2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3]\nRow 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRow 2: [0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 8, 1, 0]\nRow 4: [0, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0]\nRow 5: [0, 1, 8, 0, 8, 8, 1, 0]\nRow 6: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRow 7: [4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 6]\n\nTop-left quadrant (rows 0-3, columns 0-3):\n\nRow 0: 2,1,0,0 \u2192 no 8s.\nRow 1: 1s \u2192 no 8s.\nRow 2: 0,1,0,8 \u2192 one 8.\nRow 3: 0,1,8,8 \u2192 two 8s.\nTotal in top-left: 3 8s. But the output's third row has 6. Hmm. If each 8 is multiplied by 2, that's 3*2=6. So maybe in the top-left quadrant, the sum of 8s is 3, so output is 6. Looking at the output for Example 0, third row's third element is 6. Wait, the third row of the output is [0,0,6,0]. So the third element is 6. But in the top-left quadrant, maybe the sum of 8s is 3, so 3*2=6. Then, how are the other numbers determined?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is arranged such that each quadrant's sum of 8s is multiplied by 2. Then top-left has 3 \u2192 6. Top-right quadrant (columns 4-7) in rows 0-3:\n\nRow 0: 0,0,1,3 \u2192 no 8s.\nRow 1: 1s \u2192 no.\nRow 2: 0,0,1,0 \u2192 no.\nRow 3: 0,8,1,0 \u2192 one 8.\nTotal: 1 \u2192 2. But the output's top row has 0,2,0,0. So maybe top-right quadrant's sum is 1 \u2192 2, which would be the second element in the first row. But the first row's second element is 2, which matches. So that's possible.\n\nSimilarly, bottom-left quadrant (rows 4-7, columns 0-3):\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,0 \u2192 no.\nRow 5: 0,1,8,0 \u2192 one 8.\nRow 6: 1s \u2192 no.\nRow 7: 4,1,0,0 \u2192 no.\nTotal 8s: 1 \u2192 2. The output's fourth row starts with 4, but according to this, maybe it's 2. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quadrants are split into 2x2 blocks. For Example 0's input, which is 8x8, splitting into 2x2 blocks would give 4x4 blocks (since 8/2=4). Each 2x2 block in the input corresponds to a cell in the output. Then, how is each output cell derived from the input block?\n\nLet's take the first block (rows 0-1, columns 0-1):\n\nRow 0: [2,1]\nRow 1: [1,1]\nThis block has elements 2,1,1,1. The output's first cell is 0. How does that happen? Maybe sum all elements except 1s and 8s. But 2 is the only non-1, non-8 here. So 2. But the output is 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe count the number of 8s in the block and multiply by 2, but this block has 0 8s, so 0. That matches the first output cell. Let's check another block.\n\nTake the third row's block (rows 2-3, columns 2-3):\n\nRow 2: 0,8\nRow 3:8,8\nThis block has three 8s. So 3*2=6. The output's third row, third column is 6. That matches. Similarly, for the block in rows 4-5, columns 4-5:\n\nRow 4: 8,0\nRow 5:8,8\nThis has three 8s. So 3*2=6. The output's fourth row, third and fourth elements are 6 and 6. Hmm, but in the fourth row of the output, the third element is 6 and fourth is 6. Wait, maybe the block for columns 4-5 and rows 4-5 has three 8s, so 6. But in the output's fourth row, third and fourth positions. Not sure. Maybe each 2x2 block is mapped to a cell in the output, and the value is (number of 8s in the block) multiplied by 2. Let's check.\n\nFirst block (rows 0-1, columns 0-1): 0 8s \u2192 0. Output first cell is 0. Correct.\n\nSecond block (rows 0-1, columns 2-3): 0 and 0 in row 0, 1 and 1 in row 1. 0 8s \u2192 0. Output's first row, second element is 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, output first row is [0,2,0,0]. The second element is 2. But according to this, it should be 0. So maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nAlternative idea: the output is the perimeter of the input. For Example 0, the input's first row starts with 2 and ends with 3, the last row starts with 4 and ends with 6. But the output's first row has 0 and 2, and the last row has 4 and 6. Maybe the output is formed by taking the corners and some perimeter elements. But not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\nInput is 6x6, output 2x2. The output is [9,4] and [2,0]. The first row of input starts with 9 and ends with 4, matching the first output row. The last row of input starts with 2 and ends with 3, but the output's second row is [2,0]. So maybe the 0 comes from somewhere else. Maybe the number of 8s in the middle rows. Let's check Example 1's input middle rows:\n\nRow 2: [0,1,8,8,1,0]\nRow3: [0,1,8,0,1,0]\n\nThe 8s in these rows: row2 has two 8s, row3 has one. Total 3. But output's second element is 0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by the first element of the first row, the last element of the first row, the first element of the last row, and the number of 8s in the middle rows multiplied by some factor. But in Example 1, the 8s total 3, which would give 6, but output's second row is [2,0], which doesn't include 6. Hmm.\n\nBack to Example 0's output. The third row of output has a 6. Let's see the corresponding part of the input. For example, the middle rows (rows 2-5) in the input have several 8s. The output's third and fourth rows have 6s. Perhaps each 6 is derived from the count of 8s in a certain area multiplied by 2.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the third row's third element is 6. Let's look at the input's corresponding 2x2 block. Let's take rows 2-3, columns 2-3:\n\nRow2: 0,8\nRow3:8,8\nThat's three 8s. 3*2=6. So that's correct. Then the third output row's third element is 6. Similarly, another block in rows 4-5, columns 4-5:\n\nRow4:8,0\nRow5:8,8\nThat's three 8s. 3*2=6. So the output's fourth row, third and fourth elements are 6 and 6. Wait, why two 6s? Maybe each 2x2 block is mapped to the output. For example, in the input, each 2x2 block becomes a cell in the output. So for an 8x8 input, there are 4x4 output cells. Each cell is calculated as the number of 8s in the corresponding 2x2 block multiplied by 2. But also, there are numbers other than 0, 1, and 8 in the input (like 2,3,4,6, etc.). How do those fit in?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input first row: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. The first 2x2 block is rows 0-1, columns 0-1. The elements are 2,1,1,1. There are no 8s here, so the output cell is 0. That's correct. The next block (columns 2-3, rows 0-1): 0,0,1,1. No 8s \u2192 0. The third block (columns 4-5): 0,0,1,1 \u2192 0. Fourth block (columns 6-7):1,3,1,1. No 8s \u2192 0. So the first output row would be [0,0,0,0], but the actual output is [0,2,0,0]. Hmm, so that's not matching.\n\nSo maybe there's another rule for numbers that are not 1 or 8. For example, if a block contains a number that's not 1 or 8 (like 2,3,4, etc.), then that number is added to the output. But if there are multiple such numbers, perhaps they are summed. Let's check.\n\nIn the first block of Example 0 (rows 0-1, columns 0-1): 2,1,1,1. The numbers not 1 are 2. So output would be 2. But the first output cell is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the perimeter of the input is considered. For Example 0, the first and last rows and columns. The perimeter elements include 2,3,4,6, etc. But the output's second row starts with 2, which could be from the first element of the second input row? Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by the numbers from the corners of the input and the sum of 8s in certain regions. For Example 0, the output has 2 in the first row, which could be from the first element of the first input row (2), but the output cell is 0. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the numbers from the first and last elements of each row in the input and then some processing. For example, in Example 0's input:\n\nFirst row starts with 2 and ends with 3. The output's first row has 0 and 2. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs:\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,0,0]\nRow 1: [2,2,0,3]\nRow 2: [0,0,6,0]\nRow 3: [4,0,6,6]\n\nNotice that 2,3,4,6 appear. The input's first and last rows have 2,3,4,6 as their first and last elements. So maybe these numbers are being placed in the output's corners or edges. For example, the first element of the input's first row (2) is placed in the second position of the output's first row. The last element of the input's first row (3) is in the fourth position of the output's second row. The first element of the input's last row (4) is in the first position of the output's last row. The last element of the input's last row (6) is in the fourth position of the output's last row.\n\nSo maybe the output's corners are taken from the input's corners, but adjusted. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's input has:\n\nTop-left corner: 2\nTop-right:3\nBottom-left:4\nBottom-right:6\n\nThe output's four corners would be:\n\nTop-left:0 (but output's first element is 0)\nTop-right:0 (output's first row last element is 0)\nBottom-left:4 (output's last row first element is 4)\nBottom-right:6 (output's last row last element is 6)\n\nSo the input's bottom corners are preserved, but the top corners are not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's non-zero elements come from the input's first and last rows, and the 8s are converted to 6s (since 8*0.75=6?), but that's a stretch.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the third and fourth rows have 6s. The input's middle rows have 8s, and 6 is 8*0.75. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input is 8x8 again. Output is 4x4. The output has elements like 6,2,7,4. Let's check the input's first and last rows:\n\nFirst row: [6,1,0,0,0,0,1,2]\nLast row: [7,1,0,0,0,0,1,4]\n\nThe output's first row is [0,6,0,2], which could be taking the first and last elements of the first input row (6 and 2). The last output row is [7,7,4,0], taking the first (7) and last (4) elements of the last input row.\n\nIn Example 2's output:\n\nFirst row: [0,6,0,2] \u2192 6 is the first element of the input's first row, 2 is the last.\n\nLast row: [7,7,4,0] \u2192 7 is first element of input's last row, 4 is the last.\n\nSo maybe the output's first and last rows are formed by taking the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows. And the middle rows are derived from the count of 8s multiplied by 2.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's input first row: 2 and 3, so output first row has 2 in position 2 (index 1). The last input row has 4 and 6, so the last output row has 4 and 6 in their respective positions.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the first row is [0,2,0,0]. The 2 is in the second position. The first element of the input's first row is 2. So maybe the output's first row has the first element of the input's first row in the second position, and the last element of the input's first row in the fourth position. Wait, but the input's first row's last element is 3, and the output's second row's last element is 3.\n\nHmm. This seems inconsistent. Let's check Example 2's output:\n\nFirst row: [0,6,0,2]. The input's first row starts with 6 and ends with 2. The output's first row has 6 in position 2 (index 1) and 2 in position 4 (index 3). Then, the second row of the output is [6,6,2,0]. Where does this come from? Maybe the second input row is all 1s, so contributes nothing. But in the output's second row, the first element is 6. How does that relate?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's rows are formed by taking the first and last elements of the input's corresponding rows, but only for certain rows, and the middle rows are processed based on 8s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by merging pairs of rows and columns in a specific way. For example, each pair of rows in the input is combined into a single row in the output. Let's check.\n\nFor Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0 and 1 might combine into output row 0. But output row 0 is [0,2,0,0]. How?\n\nAlternatively, take the first element of the first row and the last element of the first row, and similarly for other rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking for how the numbers in the output are derived. For example, in Example 0's output:\n\n- The 2 in the first row could come from the first element of the input's first row (2).\n- The 3 in the second row's last position could come from the first row's last element (3).\n- The 4 in the last row's first position comes from the last row's first element (4).\n- The 6 in the last row's last position comes from the last element of the last row (6).\n- The 6s in the third and fourth rows might come from the count of 8s multiplied by 2.\n\nSo perhaps the output's corners are the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows. The middle elements are derived from the count of 8s in certain regions.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\n- Top-left corner: 0 (input first row first element is 2)\n- Top-right:0 (input first row last is 3)\n- Bottom-left:4 (input last row first)\n- Bottom-right:6 (input last row last)\n\nBut this doesn't match. So maybe the output's first and last rows are derived from the input's first and last rows, and the middle rows from the count of 8s.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output's dimensions are half the input's. For example, input is 8x8 \u2192 output 4x4, input 6x6 \u2192 output 2x2. So the output size is (n/2) x (n/2), where n is the input size. So the test input is 10x10, so output should be 5x5? But the examples show that when input is even-sized, the output is half the size. Wait, but in Example 1, the input is 6x6 and output is 2x2. Wait 6/2=3, but output is 2x2. That's confusing. So maybe the output is (n-2)/2 x (n-2)/2. For 8x8 \u2192 (8-2)/2=3 \u2192 but output is 4x4. No. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, in Example 1, input is 6 rows and 6 columns. Output is 2 rows and 2 columns. 6 / 3 = 2. So perhaps the input is divided into 3x3 blocks. For each 3x3 block, we take some value. For a 6x6 input, two rows and columns of 3x3 blocks. But how would that work?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first and last rows, and the middle rows are processed for 8s. Let's try that for Example 1:\n\nInput first row: [9,1,0,0,1,4]. Output first row [9,4]. So 9 is first, 4 is last.\n\nLast input row: [2,1,0,0,1,3]. Output last row [2,0]. Hmm, why 0? Maybe the middle rows have 8s. The middle rows of input (rows 2 and 3) have 8s. Row2 has two 8s, row3 has one. Total 3 \u2192 3*2=6, but the output's second element is 0. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in all training examples, the output's non-zero elements (excluding those that are copies from the input's corners) are multiples of 2. For example, in Example 0, the 6s (3*2), and the 2 in the first row could be from a single non-1, non-8 number (but that's not matching). Maybe the output cells are generated by two rules:\n\n1. If the corresponding 2x2 block in the input contains any numbers other than 1 or 8, sum them and place in the output cell.\n2. If there are 8s in the block, count them and multiply by 2 to place in the output cell.\n\nBut how to handle blocks that have both non-1/8 numbers and 8s?\n\nLet's test this hypothesis on Example 0.\n\nFirst block (rows 0-1, cols 0-1): elements 2,1,1,1. Non-1/8 numbers: 2. Sum is 2. Output cell is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell is the sum of non-1 numbers (including 8s) multiplied by some factor.\n\nIn the same block, non-1 numbers: 2. Sum is 2. But output is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is formed by two steps:\n\n- The first and last rows of the output are formed by taking the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows, and the middle elements are zeros.\n- The middle rows of the output are formed by counting the number of 8s in each 2x2 block of the input's middle rows, multiplied by 2.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nOutput first row [0,2,0,0]. The input's first row starts with 2 and ends with 3. So maybe the output's first row is [0,2,0,3], but the actual output is [0,2,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output's first row takes the first element of the input's first row and the last element of the input's first row, and places them in specific positions.\n\nIn Example 0's output first row: 2 is in the second position. The input's first row first element is 2. So maybe the output's first row's second element is the input's first element. Similarly, the last element of the output's first row could be the input's first row's last element. But in this case, it's 0. So not.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by the perimeter of the input, but downsampled. For example, take every other element from the first and last rows and columns.\n\nIn Example 0's first row: [2,1,0,0,0,0,1,3]. Taking every other element would be [2,0,0,1]. But output first row is [0,2,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother angle: the output seems to have elements from the corners of the input and counts of 8s in certain regions. For Example 0's output:\n\n- The 2 in the first row's second position and 3 in the second row's last position might correspond to the input's first row's 2 and 3.\n- The 4 in the fourth row's first position and 6 in the last position correspond to the input's last row's 4 and 6.\n- The 6s in the middle rows are from counts of 8s multiplied by 2.\n\nSo perhaps the output is structured as follows:\n\n- The first and last elements of the output's first row are the first and last elements of the input's first row.\n- The first and last elements of the output's last row are the first and last elements of the input's last row.\n- The middle rows of the output are determined by the count of 8s in the corresponding blocks of the input's middle rows.\n\nBut in Example 0's output first row, the first element is 0, not 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output's first and last elements are zero, and the numbers from the input's first and last rows are placed in the middle positions.\n\nExample 0's first output row is [0,2,0,0]. The input's first row starts with 2. So 2 is placed in the second position. The input's first row ends with 3, which is placed in the fourth position of the output's second row. \n\nSimilarly, the input's last row starts with 4 and ends with 6. In the output's last row, 4 is in the first position and 6 in the fourth.\n\nThis seems to be a pattern. So, the output's rows are as follows:\n\n- For the first output row: the second element is the first element of the input's first row, and the fourth element is the last element of the input's first row. But in Example 0's output, the first row is [0,2,0,0], so the fourth element is 0, which doesn't match the input's first row last element (3). So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's first and last rows are constructed by taking the first element of the input's first row and placing it in the second position of the output's first row, and the last element of the input's first row is placed in the fourth position of the output's second row. Similarly, the input's last row's first element is placed in the first position of the output's last row, and the last element in the fourth position of the output's last row.\n\nBut this feels too arbitrary. \n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has the same number of rows as the number of pairs of rows in the input. For Example 0, 8 rows \u2192 4 output rows. Example 1, 6 rows \u2192 2 output rows. Example 2, 8 \u21924. Test input has 10 rows \u21925 output rows.\n\nBut the outputs in the examples are not necessarily the same number of rows as the input's half. For instance, Example 1's input has 6 rows, output 2 rows. 6/3=2. So maybe the input is divided into sections based on the rows that are all 1s. Let's check.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nRow 1 and row 6 are all 1s. So the input is divided into sections separated by rows of 1s. The sections are:\n\n- Rows 0-0 (before first row of 1s)\n- Rows 2-5 (between the two rows of 1s)\n- Rows 7-7 (after the second row of 1s)\n\nBut the output has 4 rows. So maybe each section contributes a part of the output. For Example 0, the sections are:\n\n- Section 1: row 0\n- Section 2: rows 2-5\n- Section 3: row 7\n\nThen the output is formed by processing each section. For example:\n\n- The first and third sections (single rows) contribute to the output's first and last rows.\n- The middle section (rows 2-5) contributes to the middle two rows of the output, possibly by counting 8s.\n\nBut Example 0's output has 4 rows, which could correspond to two sections, each contributing two rows. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nRows 1 and 4 are all 1s. So sections:\n\n- Row 0\n- Rows 2-3\n- Row 5\n\nThe output has 2 rows. So maybe each section contributes to a row in the output. The first section (row 0) contributes [9,4], the middle section (rows 2-3) contributes nothing (since output has [2,0], which comes from row 5). Not sure.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Let's try to focus on the 8s and the numbers in the output.\n\nIn Example 0, the middle output rows (third and fourth) have 6s. The middle input rows (rows 2-5) have several 8s. For each 2x2 block in these rows, the count of 8s multiplied by 2 gives the output value. For example:\n\nIn rows 2-3, columns 2-3: three 8s \u2192 6. So output row 2, column 2 is 6.\n\nIn rows 4-5, columns 4-5: three 8s \u2192 6. So output row 3, columns 3 and 4 are 6.\n\nBut how are the other numbers in the output determined, like the 2, 3, 4, etc.?\n\nLooking at the output's first row in Example 0: [0,2,0,0]. The 2 could be from the input's first row's first element (2). The output's second row has [2,2,0,3]. The 2s and 3 could be from other parts of the input. Maybe the numbers not in the middle sections are taken from the input's first and last rows, placed in specific positions.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe output is formed by two parts:\n\n1. The perimeter elements of the input's first and last rows are placed in specific positions in the output's first and last rows.\n2. The middle rows of the output are derived from the count of 8s in the middle sections of the input, multiplied by 2.\n\nBut how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the following:\n\n- The first and last elements of the input's first and last rows are placed in the output's corners or edges.\n- The middle part of the output is filled by counting the number of 8s in each 2x2 block of the input's middle rows and multiplying by 2.\n\nBut the examples show that the middle rows of the output have 6s when there are 3 8s in a block (3*2=6). \n\nSo, let's apply this pattern to the test input.\n\nTest input is 10x10. First and last rows are:\n\nFirst row: [3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4]\nLast row: [7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5]\n\nSo the output's first row should have 3 and 4 in certain positions. The last row should have 7 and 5. The middle rows should be filled based on the count of 8s in 2x2 blocks of the input's middle rows.\n\nThe input's middle rows are rows 2-7. Let's look for 8s:\n\nRow2: [0,1,0,8,8,0,0,0,1,0]\nRow3: [0,1,8,8,8,0,8,0,1,0]\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,8,0,8,0,1,0]\nRow5: [0,1,0,8,0,8,8,0,1,0]\nRow6: [0,1,8,8,0,8,0,8,1,0]\nRow7: [0,1,0,8,0,0,8,0,1,0]\n\nThese rows contain various 8s. We need to process each 2x2 block in these rows and count the 8s.\n\nThe input is 10x10, so the output should be 5x5. Each 2x2 block in the input becomes one element in the output. For example:\n\nThe first 2x2 block (rows 0-1, cols 0-1) in the input is:\n\nRow0:3,1\nRow1:1,1\n\nNo 8s \u2192 0. So output cell (0,0) is 0.\n\nBut considering the test input's first row has elements 3 and 4 as first and last, these might be placed in the output's first row. How?\n\nFollowing the pattern from the examples, the first row of the output would have the first element of the input's first row (3) in the second position and the last element (4) in the last position. So output first row: [0,3,0,0,4]. But the output size depends on how the input is divided into blocks.\n\nBut given that the test input has 10 rows and columns, each block would be 2x2, resulting in 5x5 output. Let's attempt to process the 8s in the middle rows.\n\nFor example, processing rows 2-3, cols 2-3:\n\nRow2:0,8\nRow3:8,8\n\nThis block has three 8s \u2192 3*2=6. So output cell (1,1) would be 6.\n\nAnother block: rows 2-3, cols 4-5:\n\nRow2:8,0\nRow3:8,0\n\nCount of 8s: 2 \u2192 4. So output cell (1,2) would be 4.\n\nContinuing this way, but this is time-consuming. However, the examples show that the output is formed by this method. So for the test input, the output would have the first and last elements of the first and last rows in specific positions and the middle elements based on 8 counts.\n\nPutting it all together, the test output would likely be:\n\nFirst row: [3, ... ,4]\nLast row: [7, ... ,5]\nMiddle rows filled with 6s, 4s, etc. based on 8 counts.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the output is structured such that the first and last rows of the output have elements from the first and last input rows, and the middle rows are derived from the 8 counts.\n\nBut the exact positioning isn't clear. However, given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to apply the pattern where each 2x2 block's 8 count multiplied by 2 is the output cell, and the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows are placed in the output's corresponding positions.\n\nFor the test input's first row, the first element is 3 and last is 4. These might be placed in the output's first row as [3, ... ,4]. But in the examples, the first row's first element is 0, but the second element is the first input element. For example, in Example 0's first row, the input's first element 2 is placed in the second position of the output's first row. Similarly, in Example 2, the first input element 6 is in the second position of the output's first row.\n\nSo following this pattern, the test output's first row would have 3 in the second position and 4 in the fourth position, but since the output is 5x5, perhaps positions 1 and 4. But the training examples have even-sized outputs, so this might differ.\n\nAlternatively, the test output would have the first and last elements of the input's first and last rows in specific positions, with the middle elements calculated from the 8 counts.\n\nGiven the complexity and time constraints, I'll proceed to generate the test output based on the 8 count pattern and the first/last elements placement.",

Due to the complexity, the final answer reflects the expected structure based on training examples."
