        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to find the pattern or transformation that maps the input to the output in the training examples and then apply it to the test input. \n\nFirst, I'll look closely at the training examples to understand what's happening. Let's start with Example 0. The input has some 7s and a 2 arranged in a cross shape. The output seems to have expanded those numbers into a diamond or star-like pattern. The original positions of 7 and 2 are still there, but now there are new 2s and 7s around them. For instance, the 2 in the input (row 3, column 3) is surrounded by 7s. In the output, that 2 is still there, but there are 7s and 2s radiating outwards. Similarly, the 7s in the lower part of the input expand into a similar pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has 8s and a 6 in a cross. The output again expands these numbers. The 6 is central, with 8s around it, and then 6s and 8s spread out in a diamond pattern. The original positions are part of a larger structure now.\n\nSo, the pattern seems to involve creating a diamond-shaped expansion around each number. But how exactly? Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2 is at the center of a cross (positions with 7s). The output has layers around the 2. Let's check the positions. For instance, around the 2 (row 3, column 3 in input, which becomes row 3 in output?), the output row 3 is [7,7,2,7,7...], and the rows above and below have [0,2,7,2,0...], and further out have [2,0,7,0,2...]. So, it's like each number is part of a diamond where the number's value decreases as you move away. Wait, but in Example 0, the center is 2, surrounded by 7s, and then 2s again. Wait, maybe it's a matter of adding layers where each layer alternates between the surrounding numbers and the center number. Or perhaps the numbers are arranged in a way where the central number (like 2 or 6) is surrounded by the other number (7 or 8), and then the next layer is the central number again, creating a diamond pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are part of a structure where the central number is the one in the cross's center (like 2 in the first example, 6 in the second), and the surrounding numbers (7 and 8) are placed in a diamond pattern expanding outward. The output seems to create a diamond where each ring alternates between the two numbers. For example, in the first example's output, around the 2, you have a layer of 7s, then 2s, then 7s again. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\nLooking at the cross structure from the input, which had a 2 at position (3,3) (assuming rows and columns start at 0?), but in the output, the 2 is now at row 3, column 2 in the output? Wait, maybe the indexing is different. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the input in Example 0 has:\n\nRow 2: [0,0,7,0,...]\nRow 3: [0,7,2,7,0,...]\nRow 4: [0,0,7,0,...]\n\nSo the cross is a vertical and horizontal line of 7s with a 2 at the center. The output for this seems to create a diamond shape. The output rows 1 to 5 have expanded the cross into a diamond. For instance, row 1 in output has 2,0,7,0,2, etc. Then row 2 has 0,2,7,2,0. Row 3 has 7,7,2,7,7. Then it repeats in the lower part. So the pattern is creating layers around the central 2, each layer being the 7s and 2s arranged in a diamond.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the central number is 6, surrounded by 8s. The output creates a diamond where each layer alternates between 6 and 8. So the approach might be: take the central number (the one in the middle of the cross in the input) and the surrounding number (the ones forming the cross arms), then create a diamond pattern where each ring alternates between the two numbers. The size of the diamond depends on the original cross's position and the layers added.\n\nWait, but how are the new numbers placed? Let's see the distances. In the first example's output, the 2 is at the center. Then, moving one step away (up, down, left, right, diagonally?), you get 7s. Then moving another step, you get 2s again. Wait, maybe it's a checkerboard pattern? Or perhaps a diamond where each layer is the other number. But in Example 0's output, the central 2 is surrounded by 7s, then those 7s are surrounded by 2s, then 7s again. But the output seems to have multiple layers. Wait, the output for Example 0's upper part (the original cross) expands into a diamond that's larger. For example, in the input, the cross is 3 rows tall (rows 2,3,4) and 3 columns wide. The output for that area is a diamond that's 5 rows tall (rows 1-5) and 5 columns wide. Similarly for the lower cross in the input.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be expanding each cross in the input into a larger diamond in the output. The diamond has layers where the numbers alternate between the center value (2 or 6) and the surrounding value (7 or 8). The layers are added around each cross in the input.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's input, there are two crosses. One is in the upper part (centered at row 3, column 3) and another in the lower part (centered at row 7, column 8). The output has two diamonds corresponding to these crosses. Similarly, in Example 1's input, there are two crosses (upper and lower), and the output has two diamonds.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each cross in the input (a central number with four surrounding numbers in the cross arms), create a diamond pattern in the output where each layer alternates between the central number and the surrounding number, expanding outward. The diamond's size depends on how many layers are added. \n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the upper diamond has layers:\n\n- Center: 2\n- Next layer: 7s\n- Then 2s\n- Then 7s again?\n\nWait, the output for Example 0's upper diamond:\n\nRow 1: [2,0,7,0,2,...]\nRow 2: [0,2,7,2,0,...]\nRow 3: [7,7,2,7,7,...]\nRow 4: [0,2,7,2,0,...]\nRow 5: [2,0,7,0,2,...]\n\nSo the diamond's layers alternate between 2 and 7. The central layer (row 3) is all 7s except the center is 2. Then moving out, the next layers have 2s at a distance of 1 from the center (like in row 2 and 4), and 2s at a distance of 2 (row 1 and 5). Wait, maybe it's more about Manhattan distance. The center is at (3,3) in the output (assuming rows and columns are 0-based). The Manhattan distance from the center would be 0 for the center cell, 1 for adjacent cells, 2 for next layer, etc. The numbers at even distances are 2, and odd distances are 7? Let's check:\n\nAt row 3, column 3: distance 0 \u2192 2 (but the original input's center was 2 here).\n\nWait, no. The center in the output's upper diamond is row 3 (output) column 2 (original input's center was row 3, column 2). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the indices. Let me reindex.\n\nAssuming that each row in the input is a list. Let's index rows from 0 to 11, columns 0 to 11.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the upper cross is centered at row 3, column 2 (since the row 3 is [0,7,2,7,0,...], so column 2 is 2, and columns 1 and 3 are 7. So the center is at (3,2) in input. In the output, the upper diamond seems to be centered at (3,2). The output's row 3 has [7,7,2,7,7,...], which is centered at column 2. Then rows 2 and 4 have [0,2,7,2,0...], which are diamond layers. So the Manhattan distance from the center (3,2) determines the value. For example:\n\nAt (3,2): distance 0 \u2192 2.\n\nAt (2,2): distance 1 \u2192 2?\n\nWait no, in row 2, column 2 of the output is 2. Wait, row 2 in the output is [0,2,7,2,0,...], so column 1 is 2? Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the diamond pattern is constructed such that each layer alternates between the center number and the surrounding number, but the direction depends on the cross's structure.\n\nAnother approach: in the input, each cross has a center value (C) and four surrounding values (S). For example, in Example 0, the upper cross has C=2 and S=7. The output creates a diamond where the center is C, and each layer alternates between S and C. The number of layers depends on how far the original cross was from the edges. Or maybe the layers are added in a specific pattern.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the upper diamond has layers expanding outward from the center. Let's see:\n\n- The center (3,2) is 2.\n- The cells at Manhattan distance 1 (up, down, left, right) are 7.\n- At distance 2 (diagonal and further), the cells are 2 again.\nWait, but in the output's row 1 (upper part), the values are [2,0,7,0,2,...], which are 2s at columns 0 and 4. But the Manhattan distance from (3,2) to (1,0) is |3-1| + |2-0| = 2+2=4. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the diamond is constructed by placing S around C, then C around S, and so on. For example, the center is C. Then, the next layer (distance 1) is S. The layer after that (distance 2) is C again, etc. But looking at Example 0's output, the cells at distance 1 from the center (like (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2)) are 7, 7, 7, 7. Then at distance 2 (like (3,0), (3,4), (1,2), (5,2)), perhaps those are 7 as well. Wait, no. For example, in row 2, column 1 in the output is 2. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each cross in the input is transformed into a diamond where the central cell is C, and each ring around it alternates between S and C. The number of layers added depends on the position. For instance, the original cross has 3 rows and columns. The output's diamond has 5 rows and columns. So the expansion adds one layer on each side. Then, in each added layer, the numbers alternate between S and C.\n\nAnother angle: in Example 0's input, the cross has a 2 in the center and 7s around. The output's diamond for this cross has 2 in the center, then 7s around it, then 2s around that, then 7s again. So it's like concentric diamonds where the layers alternate between 2 and 7, starting with 2 at the center.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the cross has 6 in the center and 8s around. The output's diamond has 6 in the center, then 8s, then 6s, then 8s again. \n\nSo the pattern is: for each cross in the input (C as center, S as surrounding), create a diamond pattern where the center is C, and each surrounding layer alternates between S and C. The size of the diamond in the output is such that each cross from the input is expanded into a diamond that's larger by a certain number of layers.\n\nBut how many layers? Let's see in Example 0: the original cross is 3x3. The output's diamond is 5x5. So perhaps adding two layers (one on each side). Wait, 3x3 to 5x5 would be adding one layer each side. So each cross becomes a diamond of size 5x5. Then, for each cell in that 5x5 diamond, the value depends on the Manhattan distance from the center. If the distance is even, it's C; if odd, it's S. Let's test:\n\nFor the upper cross in Example 0's input:\n\nCenter is (3,2). Let's take a cell (3,2) \u2192 distance 0 \u2192 C=2.\n\nCell (3,1): distance 1 \u2192 S=7.\n\nCell (3,3): distance 1 \u2192 S=7.\n\nCell (2,2): distance 1 \u2192 S=7.\n\nCell (4,2): distance 1 \u2192 S=7.\n\nCell (2,1): distance 2 (|3-2| + |2-1| =1+1=2) \u2192 even \u2192 C=2.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, row 2 (which is the row above the center) has [0,2,7,2,0,...]. So cell (2,1) is 2, cell (2,2) is 7, cell (2,3) is 2. Hmm, that's distance 1 for (2,2), which is S=7. Distance 2 for (2,1) and (2,3) would be Manhattan distance from center (3,2):\n\nFor cell (2,1): |2-3| + |1-2| =1+1=2 \u2192 even \u2192 C=2.\n\nYes, that matches. Similarly, cell (1,2): |1-3| + |2-2|=2+0=2 \u2192 even \u2192 C=2. But in the output's row 1, column 0 is 2, which is cell (1,0). Manhattan distance is |1-3| + |0-2|=2+2=4 \u2192 even \u2192 C=2. That's correct as per the output.\n\nSo the rule seems to be:\n\nFor each cross in the input (C as center, S as surrounding), create a diamond where each cell's value is C if the Manhattan distance from the center is even, and S if odd.\n\nYes, that fits the examples. Let's check Example 1:\n\nCenter is 6, S=8. For cells at even Manhattan distance from the center, they become 6; at odd distances, 8.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the upper diamond has a center cell (3,3) with 6. Cell (3,2) has 8 (distance 1 \u2192 S=8). Cell (3,4) is 8. Cell (2,3) is 8. Then, cells at distance 2 (even) are 6. For example, cell (1,3): distance |1-3| + |3-3|=2 \u2192 even \u2192 6. But looking at Example 1's output:\n\nIn row 1 (upper part), the output is [0,6,0,8,0,6,...]. The center is (3,3). So cell (1,1) (if that's part of the diamond) would be at distance |1-3| + |1-3|=4 \u2192 even \u2192 6. But in row 1 of Example 1's output, the cells are [0,6,0,8,0,6,...]. Wait, perhaps the diamond is not fully formed. Maybe there are multiple crosses or the diamonds overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Manhattan distance is computed differently. Maybe the distance is the maximum of the vertical and horizontal distances, but that might not fit.\n\nWait, let's take a cell in Example 1's output upper diamond. For instance, cell (1,1) in the output (row 1, column 1) is 6. The Manhattan distance from the center (3,3) is |1-3| + |1-3|=4 \u2192 even \u2192 6. Correct. Cell (1,3) is 8. Distance |1-3| + |3-3|=2 \u2192 even, but output shows 8 here. Wait, that's a contradiction. Hmm.\n\nWait in Example 1's output, row 1 is [0,6,0,8,0,6,0...]. So column 3 in row 1 is 8. The center is at (3,3). So for row 1, column 3: Manhattan distance is |1-3| + |3-3| =2 \u2192 even. But according to the rule, that should be 6. But the output has 8 here. So this contradicts the previous hypothesis.\n\nHmm, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me re-examine Example 1's output.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the upper cross has center at row 3, column 3 (since row 2: [0,0,0,8,0...], row 3: [0,0,8,6,8,0...], row 4: [0,0,0,8,0...]. So the center is (3,3) with value 6, surrounded by 8s. \n\nIn the output, the upper diamond for this cross is:\n\nRow 1: [0,6,0,8,0,6...]\nRow 2: [0,0,6,8,6,0...]\nRow 3: [0,8,8,6,8,8...]\nRow 4: [0,0,6,8,6,0...]\nRow 5: [0,6,0,8,0,6...]\n\nLooking at the cell (1,3) in the output (row 1, column 3) which is 8. The center is at (3,3). The Manhattan distance is |1-3| + |3-3|=2. According to the previous hypothesis, this should be 6 (even distance), but it's 8. So that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the cells adjacent to the center (distance 1) are S, and then each subsequent layer alternates between C and S, but starting with S. Wait:\n\nCenter (distance 0): C\nDistance 1: S\nDistance 2: C\nDistance 3: S\netc.\n\nBut let's test this for Example 1's cell (1,3):\n\nDistance 2 \u2192 should be C=6. But output is 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: maybe the pattern is based on the chessboard distance (Chebyshev distance), which is max(dx, dy). For the cell (1,3) in Example 1's output, the Chebyshev distance from (3,3) is max(2,0) = 2. If even, C; odd, S. Then 2 is even \u2192 6. But the output is 8. So this also doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is not based on Manhattan or Chebyshev distance. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe upper diamond's rows are:\n\nRow 1: [2,0,7,0,2...]\nRow 2: [0,2,7,2,0...]\nRow 3: [7,7,2,7,7...]\nRow 4: [0,2,7,2,0...]\nRow 5: [2,0,7,0,2...]\n\nThe pattern here is that each row and column alternates between 2 and 7. The center row (row 3) has 7s except for the center which is 2. The rows above and below have 2s and 7s in a symmetric pattern. Similarly, columns expand outward with alternating values.\n\nWait, perhaps the diamond is created by placing S in all cells that are orthogonally adjacent to the center, and C in cells that are diagonally adjacent. Then expanding further. Let's see:\n\nFor Example 0's upper diamond:\n\nCenter is 2. Orthogonally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are S=7. Diagonally adjacent (distance 2 in Chebyshev) are C=2. Then the next layer (distance 3 in Chebyshev) are S=7. But the output shows that cells two steps away (like row 1, column 0 and 4) are 2. So perhaps:\n\n- For Chebyshev distance 0: C=2\n- Distance 1: S=7\n- Distance 2: C=2\n- Distance 3: S=7\n- etc.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, cells at distance 2 (Chebyshev) from the center (3,2) would be cells like (1,2), (5,2), (3,0), (3,4). Let's check:\n\n- (1,2) in output is row 1, column 2: 7 (as per row 1's array [2,0,7,0,2...]). Wait, no. The row 1 has 2 at column 0, 7 at column 2. So (1,2) is 7. Chebyshev distance from center (3,2) is max(2, 0)=2. According to the hypothesis, this should be C=2, but it's 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try another approach.\n\nLooking at both examples, the output seems to have multiple diamonds, each corresponding to a cross in the input. Each diamond in the output has the same structure: the central value is C (from the cross's center), and then expanding outward, the values alternate between S and C in a diamond shape. The size of the diamond is larger than the original cross.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the upper cross's output diamond spans from row 1 to row 5, columns 0 to 4. The original cross was in rows 2-4 and columns 1-3. So the diamond is expanded by 1 row and column in each direction. Similarly for the lower cross. \n\nSo, perhaps the transformation is to take each cross in the input (C and S) and generate a diamond around it that extends one layer out in all directions. Each layer alternates between S and C. \n\nFor example:\n\nOriginal cross:\n\nRow r, column c is C.\n\nRow r-1, column c is S.\n\nRow r+1, column c is S.\n\nColumn c-1, row r is S.\n\nColumn c+1, row r is S.\n\nThe output diamond adds another layer around this cross. The next layer would be:\n\nRow r-2, column c \u2192 C.\n\nRow r+2, column c \u2192 C.\n\nColumn c-2, row r \u2192 C.\n\nColumn c+2, row r \u2192 C.\n\nDiagonally, cells like (r-1, c-1) would be S.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's output, the upper diamond has in row 1 (r=1), columns 0 and 4 are 2. These are two steps away from the center's column (c=2). So (1,0) and (1,4) are 2. So according to this, those are C. But in the input's cross, the center is C=2, and S=7. So the next layer after the original cross (distance 2) would be C=2. \n\nSo the layers alternate between S and C as you move outward. The original cross is the first layer (distance 1), but maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, the layers are added such that each new layer is the opposite of the previous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the diamond is formed by placing C at the center, then S in all cells at a distance of 1 (orthogonal and diagonal), then C at distance 2, etc. But that doesn't fit.\n\nLet me think of the diamond in terms of rings. The center ring is C. The first ring (around it) is S. The second ring is C. The third ring is S, and so on. \n\nIn Example 0's upper diamond:\n\n- Center (3,2) is C=2.\n- The first ring (distance 1 in Chebyshev) is S=7.\n- The second ring (distance 2) is C=2.\n- The third ring (distance 3) is S=7.\n\nLooking at row 1 in the output (upper diamond):\n\nColumns 0 and 4 are 2 (C), which would be at Chebyshev distance 2 from the center. Columns 2 is 7 (S), which is distance 2. Wait, no. Chebyshev distance from (3,2) to (1,0) is max(2 rows, 2 columns) = 2. So that cell would be in the second ring (C=2). But in the output, (1,0) is 2, which fits. Cell (1,2) is 7. Distance from (3,2) to (1,2) is 2 rows \u2192 Chebyshev distance 2 \u2192 should be C=2, but it's 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's try to find another pattern. Looking at the output arrays:\n\nIn Example 0's upper diamond:\n\nThe center row (row 3) has 7s except for the center cell which is 2. The rows above and below (row 2 and 4) have 2s and 7s. The rows further out (row 1 and 5) have 2s and 7s again.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that each cross in the input is expanded into a diamond where the number of S increases as you move outward. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are placed in a way that forms a diamond with alternating values, but the direction depends on the original cross's position.\n\nAnother observation: in both training examples, the output includes not only the transformed original crosses but also new crosses that are created in the output. For example, in Example 0's output, the upper diamond has a new cross of 2s around the original cross. Then, those 2s might form new centers for smaller diamonds. However, this doesn't seem to be the case since the lower part of the output in Example 0 has another diamond which was present in the input.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is to take each cross in the input and create a larger cross in the output, but with alternating values. For instance, the original cross is C surrounded by S. The output cross would have C at the center, S around it, then C again further out, and so on. But this also doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves rotating or mirroring the cross. But the output seems to have a different structure.\n\nLet me think of the numbers as being part of a cellular automaton-like rule. For each cell in the output, its value depends on the neighboring cells in the input. But given that the input and output are the same size (12x12), this might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking each cross from the input and expanding it into a diamond shape, where each layer of the diamond alternates between C and S. The expansion is done by adding layers outward from the original cross. Each added layer alternates the value between C and S. \n\nFor example, the original cross is layer 0 (C) and layer 1 (S). Then layer 2 is C, layer 3 is S, etc. The size of the diamond depends on how many layers are added. In Example 0, the upper cross in the input is expanded to have two layers beyond the original cross. \n\nBut how to determine how many layers to add. The original cross is 3x3 (center plus four S around). The output diamond is 5x5 (adding two layers: one S and one C). \n\nSo for each cross in the input, the output diamond is formed by adding two layers: first S, then C. But how? \n\nIn Example 0's upper cross:\n\nOriginal cross has C=2 at center, S=7 in the cross arms.\n\nThe output diamond adds a layer of C=2 around the cross, then a layer of S=7 around that. Wait, but in the output, the layers seem to alternate.\n\nAlternatively, the expansion is such that each step away from the center alternates between S and C. So:\n\nCenter: C\n\nNext step (distance 1): S\n\nNext step (distance 2): C\n\nNext step (distance 3): S\n\nBut this depends on the distance. However, the Manhattan distance approach didn't fit all cells.\n\nAlternatively, the expansion is done in a way that the original cross is the innermost part, and each new layer is added by surrounding the previous layer with the other number. For example:\n\nOriginal cross: C in center, S around.\n\nNext layer: add C around the S.\n\nNext layer: add S around the C.\n\nBut this would create a larger cross each time. But the output seems to form a diamond.\n\nMaybe the key is to look at the relative positions of the numbers in the input and output.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the upper cross is:\n\nRow 2: 7\nRow 3: 7,2,7\nRow 4: 7\n\nIn the output, this becomes:\n\nRow 1: 2,0,7,0,2\nRow 2: 0,2,7,2,0\nRow 3:7,7,2,7,7\nRow 4:0,2,7,2,0\nRow 5:2,0,7,0,2\n\nSo the pattern here is that the original cross is expanded into a diamond where each new cell is filled with C or S based on their position relative to the center. The cells that are in the same row or column as the center get S or C alternately as we move away, while the diagonal cells get the opposite value.\n\nFor example, moving up from the center (row 3, column 2), the cell at row 2, column 2 is 7 (same column) \u2192 S. The cell at row 1, column 2 is 7 (same column, two steps up) \u2192 S. But in the output, row 1, column 2 is 7. But in the output's row 1, column 0 and 4 are 2 (C). \n\nThis suggests that moving along the same row or column as the center alternates between S and C every step. But in the output, moving up from the center:\n\nRow 3, column 2 \u2192 2 (C)\nRow 2, column 2 \u21927 (S)\nRow 1, column 2 \u21927 (S) \u2192 but according to the output, it's 7. Hmm, but this doesn't alternate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that moving along the same row or column, every even step from the center is C, and every odd step is S. For example:\n\n- Center: step 0 \u2192 C\n- Step 1: S\n- Step 2: C\n- Step 3: S\n- etc.\n\nSo for the original cross:\n\n- Step 0: C\n- Steps 1 (up, down, left, right): S\n- Steps 2: C\n- Steps 3: S\n\nIn Example 0's upper diamond:\n\n- Row 3, column 2 (step 0) \u2192 C=2\n- Row 2, column 2 (step 1) \u2192 S=7\n- Row 1, column 2 (step 2) \u2192 C=2. But in the output, it's 7. This contradicts.\n\nSo this doesn't fit. \n\nAnother approach: perhaps the diamond in the output is created by placing C at the center and then creating concentric diamonds with alternating values. The first ring (around the center) is S, then next ring is C, etc. But how many rings are added?\n\nIn Example 0's upper diamond, there are two rings:\n\n- Center: C=2\n- First ring: S=7\n- Second ring: C=2\n\nSo for a cross in the input, the output diamond has two rings around the center. \n\nIn Example 0's output upper diamond:\n\nThe second ring (C=2) is placed at positions two steps away from the center in all directions. For example, row 1, columns 0 and 4; row 5, columns 0 and 4, etc. \n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's upper diamond, the center is C=6, first ring S=8, second ring C=6. \n\nSo the transformation seems to be: for each cross in the input (C and S), create a diamond in the output with two rings around the center. The rings alternate between S and C. \n\nThus, the steps to generate the output are:\n\n1. Identify all crosses in the input. A cross is a central cell with value C, surrounded by four cells (up, down, left, right) with value S. The corners (diagonal cells) are 0.\n\n2. For each such cross, create a diamond in the output where:\n   - The center is C.\n   - The first ring (Manhattan distance 1) is S.\n   - The second ring (Manhattan distance 2) is C.\n   - The third ring (Manhattan distance 3) is S.\n   - Continue until the diamond's edges reach the borders of the grid.\n\nHowever, in the examples, the diamonds seem to have two rings. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's upper diamond, the center is C=2. The first ring (distance 1) is S=7. The second ring (distance 2) is C=2. So two rings. \n\nBut in the output, there are cells at distance 3 as well. For example, row 0, column 2 in Example 0's output. The distance from center (3,2) is |0-3| + |2-2|=3. So Manhattan distance 3. According to the alternating pattern, this should be S=7. But row 0 is all zeros. Hmm. Maybe the diamond is limited to two rings (distance 2) because of the grid size. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation adds two layers around the original cross. The original cross is 3x3. Adding two layers makes it 5x5, but the examples show larger diamonds. \n\nBut perhaps the rule is to add layers up to the Manhattan distance equal to the original cross's distance from the edges. But this is unclear.\n\nLet's try applying this pattern to the test input. \n\nThe test input has two crosses. One in the upper part and one in the lower part.\n\nUpper cross:\n\nRow 1: 3\nRow 2: 3,4,3\nRow 3: 3\nCenter is at row 2, column 8 (since row 2 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,3,0,0], so columns 7,8,9 are 3,4,3. So the center is at (2,8) with C=4, S=3.\n\nLower cross:\n\nRow 6: 3\nRow 7:3,4,3\nRow 8:3\nCenter is at row 7, column 2 (row 7 is [0,3,4,3,0...], so center at (7,2), C=4, S=3.\n\nAccording to the pattern observed, each cross should be expanded into a diamond where:\n\n- Center is C=4\n- First ring (distance 1) is S=3\n- Second ring (distance 2) is C=4\n- Third ring (distance 3) is S=3\n\nBut we need to determine how many layers are added. Looking at the training examples, the output diamonds seem to have two rings beyond the original cross. So for the upper cross in the test input, which is centered at (2,8), the diamond would extend two rings outward. \n\nLet's outline the expected output for the test input's upper cross:\n\nOriginal cross is at rows 1-3, columns 7-9. Center at (2,8).\n\nIn the output, the diamond would have:\n\n- Center (2,8) \u2192 4\n- First ring (distance 1) \u2192 3\n- Second ring (distance 2) \u21924\n- Third ring (distance 3) \u21923 (if possible within the grid)\n\nBut since the grid is 12x12, we need to check if these distances fit. For the upper cross:\n\nManhattan distance from (2,8):\n\n- Cells at distance 1: up, down, left, right \u2192 (1,8), (3,8), (2,7), (2,9)\n- These should be 3.\n\n- Cells at distance 2: diagonals (1,7), (1,9), (3,7), (3,9), and two steps in any direction \u2192 (0,8), (4,8), (2,6), (2,10)\n- These should be 4.\n\n- Cells at distance 3: (0,7), (0,9), (4,7), (4,9), (1,6), (1,10), (3,6), (3,10), (5,8), etc.\n- These should be 3.\n\nBut in the output, the diamond may be truncated by the grid's edges.\n\nSimilarly for the lower cross centered at (7,2).\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nFor the upper cross centered at (2,8):\n\nThe output diamond would have:\n\nRow 0: maybe some cells if within distance.\n\nRow 1: cells at distance 1 from (2,8) \u2192 (1,8) \u21923.\n\nRow 2: center (2,8) \u21924. Also, cells at distance 1 \u2192 (2,7) and (2,9) \u21923, and cells at distance 2 \u2192 (2,6) and (2,10) \u21924.\n\nRow 3: (3,8) \u21923. Cells at distance 2 \u2192 (3,7), (3,9) \u21924.\n\nRow 4: (4,8) \u21924.\n\nRow 0: (0,8) \u21924.\n\nBut need to consider how the layers are arranged. For example, the first ring (distance 1) is 3, the second (distance 2) is 4, third (distance 3) is 3.\n\nSimilarly, for the lower cross centered at (7,2):\n\nDistance 1 cells (7\u00b11, 2) and (7, 2\u00b11) \u21923.\n\nDistance 2 cells (7\u00b12, 2), (7, 2\u00b12), and diagonals \u21924.\n\nNow, looking at the expected output:\n\nThe test input's output should have diamonds around both crosses. Let's try to construct it.\n\nFor the upper cross (C=4, S=3):\n\n- The center at (2,8) is 4.\n- Cells at Manhattan distance 1 from (2,8) become 3.\n- Cells at Manhattan distance 2 become 4.\n- Cells at Manhattan distance 3 become 3.\n\nBut within the 12x12 grid, some of these may be out of bounds. Let's check:\n\nFor example, cell (0,8) is distance 2 from (2,8) (Manhattan distance is 2) \u21924.\n\nCell (1,7) is distance 2 (1 row up, 1 column left) \u21924.\n\nSimilarly, cell (2,6) is distance 2 \u21924.\n\nFor the lower cross (C=4, S=3):\n\nCenter at (7,2).\n\nDistance 1 cells: (6,2), (8,2), (7,1), (7,3) \u21923.\n\nDistance 2 cells: (5,2), (9,2), (7,0), (7,4), and diagonals like (6,1), (6,3), etc. \u21924.\n\nNow, the output for the test input should have these diamonds. \n\nLet's see the expected output structure based on the training examples.\n\nThe output should have each cross expanded into a diamond with alternating layers of S and C. Applying this to the test input:\n\nFor each cross:\n\n- Center is 4.\n- First layer (distance 1): 3.\n- Second layer (distance 2):4.\n- Third layer (distance 3):3.\n\nBut since the grid is limited, we need to see how far these layers can go.\n\nPutting it all together, the test input's output should look like two diamonds: one upper and one lower, each with 4 at the center, surrounded by 3s, then 4s, etc.\n\nNow, let's try to write out the output rows based on this.\n\nFor the upper cross (centered at row 2, column 8):\n\n- Row 0: Only cells at distance 2 from center (2,8) would be in this row. For example, column 8: distance 2 (2 rows up) \u21924. So row 0, column 8:4. Other columns might have 0 or other values.\n\nBut need to check all cells in each row.\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: Cells at distance 1 (row 1, column 8 \u21923) and distance 3 (row 1, columns 6 and 10 \u21924 if distance 2). Wait, Manhattan distance from (2,8):\n\nFor row 1:\n\n- column 8: distance 1 \u21923.\n- columns 7 and 9: distance 2 \u21924.\n- columns 6 and 10: distance 3 \u21923.\n- other columns are 0.\n\nSo row 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,3,4,3,0]\n\nWait, but this may vary. Let's compute each cell in row 1.\n\nRow 1: All columns from 0 to 11.\n\nFor each column c in row 1:\n\ndistance = |1-2| + |c-8| =1 + |c-8|.\n\nFor c=6: distance=1+2=3 \u21923 \u21923.\nc=7: 1+1=2 \u21924.\nc=8: 1+0=1 \u21923.\nc=9: 1+1=2 \u21924.\nc=10:1+2=3 \u21923.\n\nOther columns: distance >3 \u21920.\n\nSo row 1 would have 3 at c=6,8,10 and 4 at c=7,9.\n\nSo row 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,3,4,3,0]\n\nRow 2:\n\nCenter at (2,8) is 4.\n\ndistance for each cell c in row 2:\n\n|c-8|.\n\nFor c=6: distance 2 \u21924.\nc=7:1 \u21923.\nc=8:0 \u21924.\nc=9:1 \u21923.\nc=10:2 \u21924.\n\nSo row 2 would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,4,3,4,0].\n\nRow 3:\n\ndistance from (2,8): |3-2| + |c-8|=1 + |c-8|.\n\nc=7: 1+1=2 \u21924.\nc=8:1+0=1 \u21923.\nc=9:1+1=2 \u21924.\nc=6:1+2=3 \u21923.\nc=10:1+2=3 \u21923.\n\nSo row 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,3,4,3,0].\n\nRow 4:\n\ndistance from (2,8): |4-2| + |c-8|=2 + |c-8|.\n\nc=8:2+0=2 \u21924.\nc=7:2+1=3 \u21923.\nc=9:2+1=3 \u21923.\nc=6:2+2=4 \u21924.\nc=10:2+2=4 \u21924.\n\nSo row 4 would have 4 at c=6,8,10 and 3 at c=7,9.\n\nBut wait, Manhattan distance 2 is even \u21924. Distance 3 \u21923. Distance 4 \u21924.\n\nSo row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,4,3,0,4].\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let's look at Example 0's output to see how the rows are structured.\n\nIn Example 0's upper diamond, the rows around the center have the following pattern:\n\nRow 1: 2, 0, 7, 0, 2... \u2192 this suggests that the cells two steps away in the same row as the center (distance 2) are 2 (C), and the cells one step away are 7 (S). But according to Manhattan distance, the cells two steps away (like row 1, column 0 and 4) are distance 2+0=2 \u2192 even \u2192 C=2. \n\nSo applying the same logic to the test input's upper cross:\n\nCells with even Manhattan distance from the center (C=4) are 4; cells with odd distance are 3.\n\nSo for each cell in the output, if the Manhattan distance from the center (2,8) is even \u21924, odd \u21923.\n\nSimilarly for the lower cross centered at (7,2).\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to all cells in the output for the test input.\n\nFirst, identify all crosses in the test input. The upper cross is centered at (2,8) with C=4 and S=3. The lower cross is centered at (7,2) with C=4 and S=3.\n\nFor each cross, calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell to the center. If the distance is even, set to 4; if odd, set to 3. If a cell is within both crosses' diamonds, the values may overlap. But according to the training examples, when two diamonds overlap, the values are summed or one takes precedence. However, in Example 0, there are two separate diamonds in the output, so they don't overlap. In the test input, the two crosses are in different parts of the grid, so their diamonds likely don't overlap.\n\nNow, constructing the output:\n\nFor the upper cross centered at (2,8):\n\nFor each cell (row, column), calculate Manhattan distance to (2,8).

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by carefully analyzing the examples given.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input has two clusters of numbers. The first cluster is in the middle-left area: there's a 7 at position (2,2) [assuming rows and columns start at 0], then a cross pattern around it with 7s and a 2 in the center. Then another cluster at the bottom-middle with a similar cross structure. The output for Example 0 seems to have expanded these clusters. The original 7s and 2s are still there, but there are additional numbers around them. For instance, the cross in the input becomes a larger cross in the output. Maybe each cell in the output is generated based on the sum or some transformation of neighboring cells in the input.\n\nWait, another observation: The output in Example 0 has 2s and 7s arranged in a pattern that's more spread out. The original cross in the input (like the 7,2,7 cross) becomes a larger cross in the output. For example, the central 2 in the input might be surrounded by 7s, which in turn are surrounded by 2s. Then, looking at the second cluster in the input (rows 6-8, columns 8-10), the output has similar expansion. So maybe the pattern is creating a diamond or cross shape around each non-zero cell, with the value decreasing as you move away from the center?\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's output, the numbers are 2 and 7. The input's center is 2, surrounded by 7s. In the output, around each original 7, there are new 2s, and around the original 2, more 7s. Hmm, maybe it's a matter of each non-zero cell propagating its value to adjacent cells in certain directions, but with a different value. Alternatively, maybe it's a convolution or a kernel applied to the input matrix where each non-zero cell contributes to neighboring cells based on specific rules.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has 8s and a 6 in the middle. The output has 6s and 8s in a more expanded pattern. For instance, the input's cluster at (2,3) is 8, then 6 in (3,3) with surrounding 8s. The output for that area has 6s surrounding the 8s, and then 8s further out. Similarly, the other cluster in the input (rows 8-10, columns 7-9) with 8 and 6 becomes a larger cross with 6s and 8s.\n\nSo in both examples, the central value (like 2 in Example 0, 6 in Example 1) is surrounded by the next number (7 or 8), and then that's surrounded by the next lower number (2 or 6 again). Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the central cell is 2, surrounded by 7s. In the output, the 2's cross is expanded. For example, the original 7s in the input's cross (positions around the 2) might generate 2s in their own adjacent cells. So maybe each non-zero cell in the input causes a cross-shaped pattern in the output, where the value is determined by the original cell's value. For instance, a 7 in the input would place 7 in its position and 2s in the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right), while a 2 would place 2 in its position and 7s around it. Wait, but that doesn't exactly fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of two layers: one for the original cells, and another for their neighbors. Let's see. For Example 0's input, the original 2 at (3,2) in the input becomes part of a larger cross in the output. The output's row 3 in Example 0 is [7,7,2,7,7,0,...], which is the original 2 and 7s around it, but expanded further. Wait, maybe each non-zero cell in the input creates a cross in the output where the cell itself remains the same, and then the cells adjacent (up, down, left, right) get the next lower number. For example, in Example 0, the 2 in the input would have 7s around it (since 2 + 5 =7?), but then those 7s would have 2s around them. But how does that fit with the numbers?\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 2 is at the center. In the output, that 2 is still there, but surrounded by 7s (original 7s in input are also in the output). The 7s in the input may have 2s around them. For example, the input has 7s at (2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,2). In the output, around those 7s, there are 2s. So maybe the rule is: for each cell in the input that has a value, in the output, the same cell keeps that value, and the cells adjacent (up, down, left, right) are set to a different value, which is possibly (original value -5) or something. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, 7 in input. In output, the same cell is 7, and the adjacent cells (like up, down, left, right) are 2. 7 - 5 = 2. So yes! Then the 2 in the input would have adjacent cells as 7. 2 +5=7. So the pattern is: each non-zero cell in the input propagates to its four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) with a value of (original value +/-5), and the original cell remains. But in Example 0, the input's 7s are in the output as 7, and the adjacent cells get 2. So if the input cell is 7, then adjacent cells in output get 2 (7-5=2). The input cell's 2 (like the center) would propagate 7 (2+5=7) to adjacent cells.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the input has 6 in the center and 8s around. The output's adjacent cells around 8s would be 6 (8-2=6?), and around 6s would be 8 (6+2=8). Wait, in Example 1's input, the 6 is at (3,3). In the output, the adjacent cells to 6 are 8s. So 6 +2=8. Then the 8s in the input would have adjacent cells as 6 (8-2=6). So the rule here seems to be: for a cell with value X, the adjacent cells in the output are set to X +/- 2 (depending on X being even or odd?), but in Example 0, the difference is 5 (7 and 2), while in Example 1, it's 2 (8 and 6). Hmm, this inconsistency is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that each non-zero cell in the input creates a cross in the output where the cell itself remains, and each of the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) get a value that's either higher or lower by a certain amount, but this amount depends on the original value. Let's check the numbers:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nOriginal cell is 7. Adjacent cells in output are 2. 7 -5 =2.\n\nOriginal cell is 2. Adjacent cells in output are 7. 2 +5=7.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nOriginal cell is 8. Adjacent cells in output are 6. 8-2=6.\n\nOriginal cell is 6. Adjacent cells in output are 8. 6+2=8.\n\nAh, so the difference alternates between subtracting 5 and adding 5 for Example 0 (7\u21922 and 2\u21927), and in Example 1, it's adding and subtracting 2 (8\u21926 and 6\u21928). So the difference is 5 for 7 and 2, 2 for 6 and 8. Hmm, but where do these numbers come from? Let's see:\n\n7 and 2 sum to 9. 8 and 6 sum to 14. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that each non-zero cell in the input creates a cross in the output, where the center is the same value, and the four adjacent cells are the sum of the original value and some fixed number. Wait, 7's adjacent cells are 2. 7-5=2. 2's adjacent cells are 7. 2+5=7. Similarly, 8-2=6, 6+2=8. So the pattern here is that for a given input value X, the adjacent cells in the output are X \u00b1 delta, where delta alternates between + and -, and the magnitude depends on X. But how?\n\nLooking for a pattern in delta:\n\nIn Example 0, X=7 \u2192 delta is -5 (7-5=2), X=2 \u2192 delta is +5 (2+5=7).\n\nIn Example 1, X=8 \u2192 delta is -2 (8-2=6), X=6 \u2192 delta is +2 (6+2=8).\n\nSo the delta for X seems to be 5 when X is 7 or 2, and 2 when X is 8 or 6. Hmm. Let's see if there's a relation between X and delta.\n\n7 and 2: 7-5=2 and 2+5=7. So 5 is the difference.\n\n8 and 6: 8-2=6 and 6+2=8. So 2 is the difference.\n\nWhat's the relationship between X and the delta? For 7, delta is 5 (7-5=2). For 8, delta is 2 (8-2=6). So maybe delta is (X - target) where target is the adjacent cell's value. But how to determine target?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the delta is the difference between X and the average of X and the adjacent value. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero cell in the input creates a cross in the output where the original cell's value is X, and the four adjacent cells are (X + Y) where Y alternates based on X. For example, if X is even, Y is -2; if X is odd, Y is -5. Let's test:\n\nIn Example 0, X=7 (odd). Y is -5 \u2192 7-5=2. Adjacent cells are 2. Then, when X=2 (even), Y is +5 (since adjacent cells to 2 are 7). Wait, but 2 is even. If Y is +5, then 2+5=7. So for even X, delta is +5, and for odd X, delta is -5? But in Example 1, X=8 (even), delta is -2. X=6 (even), delta is +2. So this doesn't hold. So maybe this line of thinking is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that each non-zero cell in the input generates a cross in the output. The cross has the original value in the center and a different value in the four adjacent cells. The different value seems to be related to the original value. For example:\n\n- In Example 0, 7 in input leads to 2s around it in output. 2 in input leads to 7s around.\n- In Example 1, 8 in input leads to 6s around, and 6 leads to 8s around.\n\nSo the pattern here is that the center value and the surrounding values are complementary. For 7 and 2, they sum to 9 (7+2=9). For 8 and 6, they sum to 14. Wait, 8+6=14. Not sure. Alternatively, 7 and 2: 7 - 2 =5. 8-6=2. So maybe the delta is the difference between the two. But how to determine which value to use for the surrounding cells.\n\nAlternatively, the surrounding value is the original value minus some fixed number. For Example 0's 7: 7 -5=2. For Example 1's 8: 8-2=6. Then, the original value's surrounding cells are (X - delta), where delta is 5 for 7, 2 for 8, etc. But where does delta come from? Let's see:\n\nLooking at Example 0 and 1, the delta for the input's center value (like 2 in Example 0) is +5 to get 7. For 6 in Example 1, delta is +2 to get 8. So perhaps delta is (X's delta) = (9 - X). For example:\n\nIn Example 0: X=2 \u2192 9-2=7, which is the surrounding value. X=7 \u2192 9-7=2. So delta is (9 - X). Similarly, in Example 1, X=6 \u2192 14-6=8. X=8 \u2192 14-8=6. Wait, 6+8=14. So sum is 14. So perhaps for each input value X, the surrounding cells are (sum - X), where sum is 9 for Example 0 and 14 for Example 1.\n\nSo how to determine the sum? For Example 0, the sum is 9 (7+2=9), but also for the other values. Wait, the input in Example 0 has 7 and 2. The output's cross around 7 has 2, and around 2 has 7. So 7+2=9. In Example 1, the input has 8 and 6, and their surrounding cells are 6 and 8, which sum to 14. So 8+6=14. So perhaps the sum is X + Y = sum, where X is the original value and Y is the surrounding value. For Example 0, sum is 9. For Example 1, sum is 14. Hmm, but what determines which sum to use? Let's see:\n\nLooking for a pattern in the sums. 9 and 14. Let's think of 9 as 7+2, 14 as 8+6. 7 and 2 are primes? 8 and 6 are even. Not sure. Alternatively, 9 is 3^2, 14 is 2*7. Not obvious. Wait, 7 and 2: the sum is 9, which is the next number after 8 (which is the first number in Example 1). Not helpful. Alternatively, 7 is 5+2, 8 is 6+2. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: The test input has 3 and 4. Let's see what the sum would be if the same pattern applies. For 3 and 4, perhaps sum is 7 (3+4=7) or 12 (3*4=12?), but that's speculative. Let's check the test input.\n\nThe test input has cells with 3 and 4. So in the input, there's a 3 at (1,8), then a cluster of 3,4,3 in rows 2-3. Another cluster in rows 6-8, columns 2-4 with 3,4,3. According to the pattern from the examples, each non-zero cell in the input would generate a cross in the output where the original cell's value is preserved, and the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are set to (sum - X), where sum is the sum of X and Y (the surrounding value).\n\nIf we can determine the sum for 3 and 4, then we can compute the surrounding values. Let's see:\n\nLooking at Example 0 and 1:\n\n- Example 0: sum is 9 (7 and 2)\n- Example 1: sum is 14 (8 and 6)\n\nIs there a pattern between the sum and the numbers? Let's see:\n\n7 and 2: sum 9. 7 is the larger number. 9 is 7 + 2.\n\n8 and 6: sum 14. 8 +6=14.\n\nFor the test case's 3 and 4, sum would be 3+4=7. Then, the surrounding cells for 3 would be 7-3=4, and for 4, 7-4=3. So in the output, each 3 in the input would have adjacent cells set to 4, and each 4 would have adjacent cells set to 3.\n\nWait, but in the training examples, the sum seems to be the sum of the original value and the surrounding value. So for each X in the input, the surrounding cells in the output are (sum - X), where sum is X + Y. In Example 0, sum is 9 (7+2). So for a 7, surrounding cells are 2 (9-7), and for a 2, surrounding cells are 7 (9-2). Similarly, Example 1's sum is 14 (8+6), so for an 8, surrounding cells are 6, and for 6, they're 8.\n\nIf that's the case, then for the test input's 3 and 4, the sum would be 3+4=7. So a 3 in the input would have adjacent cells as 4 (7-3), and a 4 in the input would have adjacent cells as 3 (7-4).\n\nSo applying this:\n\nFor each non-zero cell in the input, the output will have the same value in that cell, and the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) will be set to (sum - X), where sum is the sum of the original X and the surrounding value. But wait, how do we know the sum for a given input? Because in the training examples, the sum was determined by the two different values present (7 and 2, sum 9; 8 and 6, sum 14). So in the test input, the two values are 3 and 4, so sum is 3+4=7. Therefore, surrounding cells would be 7-3=4 and 7-4=3.\n\nSo let's apply this to the test input.\n\nThe test input has two main clusters:\n\nFirst cluster at row 1, column 8 (value 3). Then a cluster in rows 2-3, columns 7-9: values 3,4,3. Another cluster in rows 6-8, columns 2-4: 3,4,3.\n\nLet me process each of these cells:\n\nStarting with the 3 at (1,8) (row 1, column 8). In the output, this cell remains 3. The four adjacent cells (up: row 0, column 8; down: row 2, column 8; left: row 1,7; right: row 1,9) will be set to 4 (since sum is 7, 7-3=4).\n\nNext, the 3 at (2,7), (2,9), (3,8). Wait, the input's cluster is:\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,3,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nSo the cells are:\n\nRow 2, columns 7:3; row 2,8:4; row 2,9:3.\n\nRow 3,8:3.\n\nEach of these 3s and 4 in the input will generate their own crosses in the output.\n\nFor the 3s:\n\nEach 3 in input will have adjacent cells set to 4 (7-3=4). The 4 in the input (row2, col8) will have adjacent cells set to 3 (7-4=3).\n\nSimilarly, the other cluster in rows6-8, cols2-4:\n\nRow6: [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,3,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the cells here are row6, col2:3; row7, col1:3; row7,col2:4; row7,col3:3; row8,col2:3.\n\nProcessing each:\n\n3s will have adjacent cells set to 4, and the 4 will have adjacent cells set to 3.\n\nBut we have to be careful because multiple cells might contribute to the same output cell. For example, a cell that is adjacent to both a 3 and a 4 would have values summed or overridden? Wait, in the training examples, overlapping contributions from multiple cells are handled by overwriting. Let's check Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the original 7s and 2s are in certain positions. In the output, overlapping areas have the sum of contributions? Or the last one written? For instance, in the output of Example 0, row1, col2 is 7, which comes from the original cell (row2, col2) in input being 7. But row1, col2 is adjacent to row2, col2's 7, so the 7 would propagate a 2 to row1, col2. But in the output, row1, col2 is 7. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps the original cell's value is kept, and the adjacent cells are set to the sum minus original value. Let's re-examine Example 0's input and output.\n\nOriginal input has in row2, col2 a 7. The output for row2, col2 is 7 (same as input). But the output for row1, col2 is 7 as well. Wait, according to the output of Example 0, the first few rows are:\n\nOutput row1: [2,0,7,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row2: [0,2,7,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, in row1, col2, it's 7, which is adjacent to row2, col2's 7. According to the earlier logic, the 7 in row2, col2 would set row1, col2 (up) to 2. But in the output, it's 7. So this contradicts the earlier hypothesis. Therefore, there's a mistake in my previous reasoning.\n\nThis means that the pattern is more complex. Let me re-examine Example 0.\n\nInput for Example 0 has:\n\nRow2: [0,0,7,0,0,...]\n\nRow3: [0,7,2,7,0,...]\n\nRow4: [0,0,7,0,0,...]\n\nSo the 7s form a cross around the 2. The output's corresponding rows:\n\nRow1: [2,0,7,0,2,0,...]\n\nRow2: [0,2,7,2,0,...]\n\nRow3: [7,7,2,7,7,...]\n\nRow4: [0,2,7,2,0,...]\n\nRow5: [2,0,7,0,2,...]\n\nSo looking at row3, col0:7. Where does that come from? The input's row3, col0 is 0. But output has 7 there. How?\n\nAh, maybe the pattern is that the output is created by expanding each non-zero cell into a larger cross. For example, the original cross (7,2,7) in the input expands into a larger cross in the output, with layers. For instance, the original 2 in the center might generate a larger cross of 7s, and the 7s in the input generate crosses of 2s. But the output seems to have multiple layers.\n\nAnother approach: think of each non-zero cell in the input as a center of a cross in the output. The cross in the output has the original value in the center, and then layers expanding out with a different value. For example, the 2 in the input leads to a cross of 7s in the output, and the 7s in the input lead to crosses of 2s. Then, overlapping areas might have their values combined or overwritten.\n\nBut how does this explain the output of Example 0?\n\nThe input's 2 at (3,2) in the output is still 2. The cells around it (up, down, left, right) in the output are 7s. Then, the cells adjacent to those 7s (up, down, left, right) are 2s. For example, row3, col2 (2) has row2, col2 (7) which is part of the input. So in the output, the original 7s from the input have their own cross of 2s. So the output is a combination of all crosses generated by each non-zero input cell.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. For each cell in the input that is non-zero (X), create a cross in the output:\n\n   a. The center cell (same as input cell) remains X.\n\n   b. The four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are set to Y, where Y is determined based on X (like X \u00b1 delta).\n\n   c. The next layer (two steps away) are set to X again, and so on.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's output, the original 2 in row3, col2 has 7s in row2,3,4 (same column) and row3, columns 1 and 3. Then, those 7s have 2s around them in the output. For example, row2, col2 is 7, and in the output, the cells adjacent to it (row1, col2; row2, col1; row2, col3; row3, col2) are 2, 2, 2, and 2 (but row3, col2 is the original 2). So perhaps each non-zero cell in the input generates a cross of its own value, and then another cross around it with Y, and so on. But this might create multiple layers.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be generated by applying a two-step process. For example, each non-zero cell in the input creates a cross of Y around it, and then each of those Y cells create a cross of X around them. But that might explain the layers.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Let's look at the test input again. The test input has clusters of 3 and 4. According to the pattern from the training examples, each 3 and 4 should generate crosses in the output with their complementary values. If the sum is 7 (3+4), then:\n\n- Each 3 in the input creates a cross of 4s around it.\n\n- Each 4 in the input creates a cross of 3s around it.\n\nBut overlapping areas would have values overwritten by the latest contribution, or summed. But in the training examples, overlapping cells seem to have their values set based on which source cell they are adjacent to. For instance, in Example 0, the original 2's cross (7s) and the original 7's crosses (2s) overlap. For example, the cell (3,2) in input is 2. The cell (2,2) is 7 in input. In output, (3,2) is 2, and (2,2) is 7. The cell (3,2) in output is 2, which is from the input. Then, the cell (3,1) in output is 7 (from the 2's cross). The cell (3,3) in output is 7 (also from 2's cross). The cell (2,2) in output is 7 (from input), and its adjacent cells are 2s. So, the 7's cross creates 2s around it, and the 2's cross creates 7s around it. So overlapping occurs when a cell is adjacent to multiple sources.\n\nBut how are overlaps resolved? For example, if a cell is adjacent to both a 3 and a 4, what value does it take? Let's look at the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0, let's look at row 5 in the output:\n\n[2, 0, 7, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 7, 0, 2, 0]\n\nThis row has 2s and 7s. For example, the 7 at position 8 in row5 might be from a 2's cross above or below. But I think the key is that each non-zero input cell's cross is applied, and if multiple crosses affect the same cell, their values are added or overwritten. However, in the training examples, the output values don't show summation (all values are single digits). So it's more likely that the latest cross applied overwrites the previous value. But how is the order determined?\n\nAlternatively, the output is built by first initializing all cells to 0, then applying each cross from the input cells, with each cross overwriting any previous values. So if two crosses affect the same cell, the last one applied determines the value. But the order in which the input cells are processed would matter. But the training examples don't specify an order.\n\nAlternatively, the output cell takes the maximum value from all applicable contributions. Let's check Example 0:\n\nIn row3, col0 of output is 7. But in the input, there's no cell there. How does this happen? It must be from a cross generated by another cell. Looking at the input, the original 7s are at (2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,2). The cell (3,0) is two steps left of (3,2). So perhaps the cross expands two layers. Wait, but how?\n\nThis suggests that the cross generated by each non-zero input cell is larger than just the immediate neighbors. For example, the 2 in the input generates a cross that extends two layers out: the first layer is 7s, the second layer is 2s again. Similarly, the 7s generate a cross that extends two layers: first layer of 2s, then another layer of 7s. But this creates a diamond pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 0's row1: [2,0,7,0,2,...]. The 7 here is at (1,2). The original input's 7 is at (2,2). So the cross for the 7 at (2,2) would have its adjacent cells (up, down, etc.) set to 2. But (1,2) is up from (2,2), so it's set to 2. But in the output, it's 7. That contradicts. So my previous assumption must be wrong.\n\nThis indicates that the pattern is not simply expanding each cell's value to adjacent cells. There's a different mechanism.\n\nAnother approach: the output seems to be a diamond-shaped expansion of the input's non-zero cells. For example, the input's 2 and 7 form a small cross, and the output has a larger diamond pattern. Let me think about how diamonds are formed.\n\nA diamond pattern can be created by considering cells at a Manhattan distance of 1 and 2. For example, the center cell is X, cells at distance 1 are Y, cells at distance 2 are X again, and so on. This creates a diamond shape.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the original 2 at (3,2) is surrounded by 7s at distance 1, and those 7s are surrounded by 2s at distance 2. So it's a diamond of size 2. Similarly, the 7s in the input generate a diamond of 2s at distance 1 and 7s at distance 2.\n\nBut how does this fit with the output dimensions? Let's see.\n\nFor the 2 in Example 0's input, the output has:\n\n- At distance 0 (center): 2\n\n- At distance 1: 7s\n\n- At distance 2: 2s\n\nThis creates a diamond shape. Similarly, for the 7s in the input, their diamonds have:\n\n- Center:7\n\n- Distance 1:2\n\n- Distance 2:7\n\nSo for each non-zero cell in the input, the output creates a diamond where the center is the same value, and each layer alternates between X and Y, where Y is determined by X's complementary value (sum - X).\n\nIn Example 0, X=2 and Y=7 (sum 9), so layers alternate 2 and 7. For X=7, Y=2. Similarly, Example 1's sum is 14, so X=6 and Y=8.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input's 3 and 4 (sum 7):\n\n- For X=3, Y=4 (7-3=4)\n\n- For X=4, Y=3 (7-4=3)\n\nSo each non-zero cell in the input generates a diamond pattern where the center is X, layer 1 is Y, layer 2 is X, etc.\n\nThe diamond's radius depends on how many layers the output has. Looking at the training examples, the output diamonds seem to have two layers. For example, in Example 0, the output has layers up to distance 2 from the original cell. So each input cell generates a diamond of radius 2, with layers alternating X and Y.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nEach 3 in the input would generate a diamond with:\n\n- Center:3\n\n- Layer 1 (distance 1):4\n\n- Layer 2 (distance 2):3\n\nEach 4 in the input would generate:\n\n- Center:4\n\n- Layer 1:3\n\n- Layer 2:4\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nThe input has two main clusters. Let's take the first cluster at rows 2-3, columns 7-9:\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,3,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nThe center is 4 at (2,8). The 3s are around it. Each of these cells will generate their own diamonds.\n\nProcessing the 4 at (2,8):\n\n- Center:4\n\n- Layer 1 (distance 1):3\n\n- Layer 2 (distance 2):4\n\nSo cells at Manhattan distance 1 from (2,8) will be set to 3. Manhattan distance 2 will be set to 4.\n\nManhattan distance 1 includes cells up, down, left, right. For example, (1,8), (3,8), (2,7), (2,9). Layer 1.\n\nManhattan distance 2 includes cells like (0,8), (4,8), (2,6), (2,10), (1,7), (1,9), (3,7), (3,9).\n\nBut in the output, we need to consider overlapping diamonds from multiple cells. For example, the 3 at (2,7) will generate its own diamond.\n\nSimilarly, the 3 at (2,9) and (3,8) will generate their own diamonds.\n\nThis could get complex, but perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero input cell generates a diamond of radius 2, and the highest value at each cell is retained, or they are summed. However, since the training examples don't show summed values (all are single digits), it's more likely that the latest cell's contribution overwrites previous ones. But the order of processing would matter, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, each cell in the output is determined by the maximum value generated by any diamond layer. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the cell (3,0) in the output is 7. How is that generated? The original input's 7 at (3,1) would generate a diamond. The 7's diamond would have:\n\n- Center (3,1):7\n\n- Layer 1 (distance 1):2\n\n- Layer 2 (distance 2):7\n\nSo cells at distance 2 from (3,1) include (3-2,1), (3+2,1), (3,1-2), (3,1+2), etc. (3-2=1, so (1,1), which is not in the output. Wait, maybe the diamonds are of radius 2, but only include cells up to distance 2. For example, the diamond for a cell at (i,j) would include all cells (i\u00b1d, j\u00b1(d-\u03b4)), where d is the Manhattan distance.\n\nAlternatively, a diamond of radius 2 means all cells with Manhattan distance \u22642.\n\nBut let's focus on applying this to the test input.\n\nLet's start with the 4 at (2,8) in the input. Its diamond would be:\n\n- Center: (2,8) \u21924\n\n- Layer 1 (distance 1): (1,8), (3,8), (2,7), (2,9) \u21923\n\n- Layer 2 (distance 2): (0,8), (4,8), (2,6), (2,10), (1,7), (1,9), (3,7), (3,9), (1,8) again \u21924.\n\nWait, but for layer 2, Manhattan distance 2 includes cells like (2,8-2)= (2,6), (2,8+2)=(2,10), etc. But the output for Example 0 shows that the diamonds have multiple layers. For example, the 2 in Example 0's input creates a diamond that has 7s at distance 1 and 2s at distance 2. But in the output, the 2 is surrounded by 7s, which are surrounded by 2s again. So each layer alternates between the two values.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the 7s from the input's 7s create diamonds with 2s at distance 1 and 7s at distance 2. So for a 7's diamond:\n\n- distance 0:7\n\n- distance 1:2\n\n- distance 2:7\n\nSimilarly, the 2's diamond:\n\n- distance 0:2\n\n- distance 1:7\n\n- distance 2:2\n\nSo each layer alternates the value. Therefore, for a cell with value X and sum S, the layers alternate between X and (S - X).\n\nNow, applying this to the test input's 3 and 4, sum 7:\n\nFor X=3:\n\n- distance 0:3\n\n- distance 1:4 (7-3)\n\n- distance 2:3 (7-4)\n\nFor X=4:\n\n- distance 0:4\n\n- distance 1:3 (7-4)\n\n- distance 2:4 (7-3)\n\nSo each cell's diamond alternates between X and (S - X) as distance increases.\n\nNow, let's process the test input.\n\nThe first cluster in the input is at row 2, column 8:4. So for this cell (2,8):\n\n- distance 0:4\n\n- distance 1:3 (7-4=3)\n\n- distance 2:4 (7-3=4)\n\nSo the cells at distance 1 from (2,8) (up, down, left, right) will be 3.\n\nCells at distance 2 (two steps in any direction) will be 4.\n\nThe 3s around the 4 in the input (at (2,7), (2,9), (3,8)) will generate their own diamonds:\n\nFor each 3 at (2,7):\n\n- distance 0:3\n\n- distance 1:4\n\n- distance 2:3\n\nSo cells at distance 1 from (2,7) (up, down, left, right) will be 4.\n\nCells at distance 2 will be 3.\n\nSimilarly for (2,9) and (3,8).\n\nThe other cluster in rows 6-8, columns 2-4:\n\nRow6: [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,3,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nHere, the 4 is at (7,2).\n\nSo processing this 4:\n\n- distance 0:4\n\n- distance 1:3\n\n- distance 2:4\n\nThe surrounding 3s will generate their own diamonds.\n\nNow, to construct the output, we need to iterate over each non-zero input cell and apply their diamond patterns, taking into account overlapping areas. However, since multiple cells may contribute to the same output cell, we need to determine how to resolve overlaps. Since the training examples don't show summed values, it's likely that the last applied cell's contribution overwrites previous ones. But the order of processing might affect the result. Alternatively, the maximum value is taken, but in Example 0's output, the highest values are 7 and 2, which don't suggest a max rule.\n\nAlternatively, the contributions are additive, but since all output values are single digits, this might not be the case. However, let's consider that in Example 0's output, the cell (3,0) is 7. This could be from the 7 at (3,1) in the input. The distance from (3,1) to (3,0) is 1, so layer 1: 2. But in the output, it's 7. So this contradicts the earlier assumption.\n\nThis indicates that my previous understanding is incorrect. Perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a possible kernel or filter that is applied to the input matrix to generate the output. For instance, each cell in the output is a function of the surrounding cells in the input. For example, each output cell is the sum of the input cells in a certain pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nThe input has a 2 at (3,2). The output around this cell has 7s in the adjacent cells. The 7s in the input generate 2s in their adjacent cells. So maybe each output cell is the sum of the input cells in a cross pattern around it. For example, output[i][j] = sum of input[i-1][j], input[i+1][j], input[i][j-1], input[i][j+1], and possibly the center cell multiplied by some factor.\n\nBut in Example 0, the output cell (3,2) is 2, which is the same as input. The cell (3,1) in output is 7, which is the sum of input cells around it. Wait, input (3,1) is 7. The output cell (3,1) is 7. But according to the cross sum idea, the output cell (3,1) would be sum of its adjacent cells in the input: input[2,1], input[4,1], input[3,0], input[3,2]. Input[2,1] is 0, input[4,1] is 0, input[3,0] is 0, input[3,2] is 2. Sum is 2. But output is 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative kernel: Maybe each output cell is determined by the maximum value in a cross pattern in the input. For example, output[i][j] is the maximum value among input[i][j], input[i-1][j], input[i+1][j], input[i][j-1], input[i][j+1]. For Example 0's input cell (3,2)=2, the output cell (3,2) would remain 2. The adjacent cells (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2) would take the maximum of their adjacent cells, which includes the 2 and 7s. But in the output, these cells are 7. So maybe the kernel is larger.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by a two-pass process. First, each non-zero cell in the input creates a cross in the output, then those new cells create another cross, and so on. This could explain the layers. For example, each non-zero cell X in the input generates a cross of Y (sum - X) around it. Then, those Y cells generate a cross of X around them, but this might not overwrite existing values unless specified.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Given the time I have, perhaps the best approach is to apply the sum rule for each input cell and generate the output by creating diamonds of radius 2, assuming that the output is a combination of all diamonds from input cells.\n\nFor the test input's 3 and 4 (sum 7):\n\nEach 3 in the input generates:\n\n- Center:3\n\n- Layer 1 (distance 1):4\n\n- Layer 2 (distance 2):3\n\nEach 4 generates:\n\n- Center:4\n\n- Layer 1:3\n\n- Layer 2:4\n\nNow, applying this to each non-zero cell in the test input and combining the results.\n\nLet's start processing each non-zero cell:\n\n1. Cell at (1,8) value 3:\n\n   - Center: (1,8) \u21923\n\n   - Layer 1 (distance 1): (0,8), (2,8), (1,7), (1,9) \u21924\n\n   - Layer 2 (distance 2): (1,6), (1,10), (-1,8) (invalid), (3,8), (0,7), (0,9), (2,7), (2,9) \u21923 (but some are out of bounds)\n\n2. Cell at (2,7) value 3:\n\n   - Center: (2,7) \u21923\n\n   - Layer 1: (1,7), (3,7), (2,6), (2,8) \u21924\n\n   - Layer 2: (0,7), (4,7), (2,5), (2,9), (1,6), (1,8), (3,6), (3,8) \u21923\n\n3. Cell at (2,8) value 4:\n\n   - Center: (2,8) \u21924\n\n   - Layer 1: (1,8), (3,8), (2,7), (2,9) \u21923\n\n   - Layer 2: (0,8), (4,8), (2,6), (2,10), (1,7), (1,9), (3,7), (3,9) \u21924\n\n4. Cell at (2,9) value 3:\n\n   - Center: (2,9) \u21923\n\n   - Layer 1: (1,9), (3,9), (2,8), (2,10) \u21924\n\n   - Layer 2: (0,9), (4,9), (2,7), (2,11) (invalid), (1,8), (1,10) (invalid), (3,8), (3,10) (invalid) \u21923\n\n5. Cell at (3,8) value 3:\n\n   - Center: (3,8) \u21923\n\n   - Layer 1: (2,8), (4,8), (3,7), (3,9) \u21924\n\n   - Layer 2: (1,8), (5,8), (3,6), (3,10) (invalid), (2,7), (2,9), (4,7), (4,9) \u21923\n\nNow, the other cluster in rows6-8, cols2-4:\n\n6. Cell at (6,2) value 3:\n\n   - Center: (6,2) \u21923\n\n   - Layer 1: (5,2), (7,2), (6,1), (6,3) \u21924\n\n   - Layer 2: (4,2), (8,2), (6,0), (6,4), (5,1), (5,3), (7,1), (7,3) \u21923\n\n7. Cell at (7,1) value 3:\n\n   - Center: (7,1) \u21923\n\n   - Layer 1: (6,1), (8,1), (7,0), (7,2) \u21924\n\n   - Layer 2: (5,1), (9,1), (7,-1) (invalid), (7,3), (6,0), (6,2), (8,0), (8,2) \u21923\n\n8. Cell at (7,2) value 4:\n\n   - Center: (7,2) \u21924\n\n   - Layer 1: (6,2), (8,2), (7,1), (7,3) \u21923\n\n   - Layer 2: (5,2), (9,2), (7,0), (7,4), (6,1), (6,3), (8,1), (8,3) \u21924\n\n9. Cell at (7,3) value 3:\n\n   - Center: (7,3) \u21923\n\n   - Layer 1: (6,3), (8,3), (7,2), (7,4) \u21924\n\n   - Layer 2: (5,3), (9,3), (7,1), (7,5), (6,2), (6,4), (8,2), (8,4) \u21923\n\n10. Cell at (8,2) value 3:\n\n    - Center: (8,2) \u21923\n\n    - Layer 1: (7,2), (9,2), (8,1), (8,3) \u21924\n\n    - Layer 2: (6,2), (10,2), (8,0), (8,4), (7,1), (7,3), (9,1), (9,3) \u21923\n\nNow, combining all these contributions. Note that when multiple diamonds overlap, the latest cell processed may overwrite the previous value. Alternatively, the highest value takes precedence. However, in Example 0's output, the values are determined by the sum minus X, so overlapping would set the cell to the value from the nearest cell. But without a clear rule from the training examples, this is challenging.\n\nAssuming that each layer's value overwrites any previous values, and the order of processing is from top to bottom, left to right.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps the correct approach is to generate the output by applying each diamond and allowing overlapping cells to be set by the latest applicable contribution. However, given time constraints, I'll proceed to generate the output based on the described pattern, ensuring that each non-zero input cell's diamond is applied.\n\nLet's create a 12x12 grid initialized to 0. Then, for each non-zero cell in the input, apply its diamond layers.\n\nFor example, the 4 at (2,8) in the input will set:\n\n- (2,8) \u21924\n\n- (1,8), (3,8), (2,7), (2,9) \u21923\n\n- (0,8), (4,8), (2,6), (2,10), (1,7), (1,9), (3,7), (3,9) \u21924\n\nBut overlapping with other cells may overwrite these values. For instance, the 3 at (2,7) will set:\n\n- (2,7) \u21923\n\n- (1,7), (3,7), (2,6), (2,8) \u21924\n\n- (0,7), (4,7), (2,5), (2,9), (1,6), (1,8), (3,6), (3,8) \u21923\n\nSo, when processing the 3 at (2,7), the cell (2,8) is set to 4 by this 3's layer 1, but the 4 from (2,8)'s own center remains 4.\n\nThis is getting quite involved, but perhaps the correct approach is to create the output by applying each input cell's diamond in layers, and for each cell in the output, the highest layer (closest to the center) takes precedence. For example, the center layer (distance 0) has the highest priority, followed by layer 1, then layer 2. This way, if a cell is part of multiple diamonds, the closest center's layer determines its value.\n\nApplying this priority rule:\n\n- For any cell in the output, the value is determined by the highest priority layer (distance 0 > distance 1 > distance 2).\n\nSo, if a cell is part of a distance 0 layer (center) of one cell and a distance 1 layer of another, the center's value takes precedence.\n\nLet's apply this to the test input.\n\nProcessing all non-zero input cells and their diamonds, prioritizing closer layers:\n\nFor example, the cell (2,8) is part of the 4's center (distance 0), so it remains 4.\n\nThe cell (2,7) is part of its own center (3), so it remains 3.\n\nThe cell (2,9) is its own center (3).\n\nThe cell (3,8) is its own center (3).\n\nNow, for the cell (2,8)'s layer 1 cells: (1,8), (3,8), (2,7), (2,9).\n\nThese cells are set to 3 unless they are centers themselves. For (3,8), it's a center (3), so it stays 3. For (2,7) and (2,9), they are centers, so their values are 3. For (1,8), it's not a center in any other diamond, so it's set to 3 from the 4's layer 1.\n\nNext, layer 2 for the 4 at (2,8): (0,8) \u21924, (4,8) \u21924, (2,6) \u21924, (2,10) \u21924, (1,7) \u21924, (1,9) \u21924, (3,7) \u21924, (3,9) \u21924.\n\nBut some of these cells may be part of other diamonds. For example, (3,7) is part of the 3's center at (3,8)'s layer 1 (distance 1), but since layer 1 has lower priority than center, but the 3's center at (3,8) is a distance 0 from itself. So (3,7) is part of the 3's layer 1 (distance 1) from (3,8), but also part of the 4's layer 2 (distance 2) from (2,8). Since layer 1 has higher priority than layer 2, (3,7) would be set to 4 (from the 3's layer 1? Wait, the 3 at (3,8) has layer 1 cells at (2,8), (4,8), (3,7), (3,9). The cell (3,7) is set to 4 (since sum is 7-3=4) from the 3's layer 1. This has higher priority than the 4's layer 2 (distance 2), so (3,7) is 4.\n\nThis is quite complex, but perhaps the best way is to generate the output step by step.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to write the output based on the pattern that each non-zero input cell generates a diamond where the center is X, layer 1 is (sum - X), layer 2 is X, and overlapping cells take the highest priority layer (distance 0 > 1 > 2).\n\nThe sum for the test input is 7 (3+4).\n\nNow, let's construct the output matrix for the test input.\n\nInitializing a 12x12 grid of 0s.\n\nProcessing each non-zero cell:\n\n1. Cell (1,8) value 3:\n\n   - Set (1,8) to 3.\n\n   - Layer 1: (0,8), (2,8), (1,7), (1,9) \u21924.\n\n   - Layer 2: (0,7), (0,9), (2,7), (2,9), (1,6), (1,10), (3,8), (-1,8) (ignored).\n\n   But since layer 2 has lower priority, only set cells not already set by higher layers.\n\nBut since we're processing in order, we'll first apply centers, then layer 1, then layer 2. But due to time, perhaps the output should resemble the training examples' structure, where each cluster is expanded into a larger cross.\n\nBased on the training examples, the output for the test input would have diamonds around each 3 and 4, resulting in alternating values of 3 and 4 in a pattern similar to the examples.\n\nAfter carefully considering the examples and the pattern, the final output for the test input should have:\n\n- The 3s and 4s from the input expand into larger diamonds with alternating 3s and 4s.\n\nThe expected output would look something like this (formatted as per the examples):\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut considering the training examples' expansion, especially how the 7s and 2s expanded, the actual output would have more extensive cross patterns. For example, the 4 in the input would generate a cross of 3s around it, and those 3s would generate 4s around them.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the final answer should be:\n\nThe output for the test input will have diamonds around each 3 and 4, with alternating values. The 4s will be surrounded by 3s, which in turn are surrounded by 4s. Similarly, the 3s will be surrounded by 4s, which are surrounded by 3s. The exact positions will form a diamond pattern around each cluster in the input.",
