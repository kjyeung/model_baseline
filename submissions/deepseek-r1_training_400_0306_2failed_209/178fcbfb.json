        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. Hmm, the input and output examples look like grids with numbers. The outputs seem to have rows filled with certain numbers. Let me look closely at the examples.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has numbers 2, 3, and 1 in different rows. The output has rows filled with 2s, 3s, and 1s. For instance, the third row in the input has a 2, and in the output, that row is all 2s. The row with 3 in the input becomes a row of 3s. Similarly, the row with 1 becomes all 1s. The other rows in the output have 2s in certain positions? Wait, no. Wait in Example 0's output, rows 0 and 1 are filled with 2s except the first two elements? Wait, no, looking at the output for Example 0:\n\nThe output has rows like [0, 0, 2, 0,...] for some rows and others filled with the number. Wait, maybe each non-zero number in the input causes certain rows to be filled with that number, possibly in the same column as the original number.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 2 is in row 2, column 2. The output has multiple rows filled with 2s in the same column. Wait no, the output rows for 2 are filled with 2 in column 2? Let me check:\n\nNo, in Example 0's output, the first output row is [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], so the third element is 2. Then the next row is the same. Then the third row is same. Then the fourth row becomes all 3s. The seventh row (index 6) is all 1s. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the non-zero numbers in the input are in certain rows, and those rows in the output are filled with their number. But that's not exactly matching. For example, the input in Example 0 has 2 in row 2 (third row), and in the output, rows 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8 (assuming 0-based) have 2 in column 2, but not the entire row filled except for the row with 3 and 1. Wait, maybe it's something else.\n\nLooking at the positions of the non-zero elements in the input. Let's see:\n\nExample 0 Input:\nRow 2 has 2 at column 2.\nRow 4 has 3 at column 7.\nRow 6 has 1 at column 3.\n\nOutput:\nRows with 2s in column 2 are 0,1,2,3,5,7,8. The row with 3 (input row 4) becomes all 3s. The row with 1 (input row 6) becomes all 1s. So perhaps when a number is present, its row in the output is filled with that number. But the output's rows for 2 are not the same as the input row. Wait, the input row 2 (with 2) becomes a row filled with 2s? No, in the output, row 2 is [0,0,2,0,...], same as others. Wait no, the output for row 2 is [0,0,2,0,...], same as rows 0,1,3, etc. Wait that's not the case. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe the output is such that for each non-zero number in the input grid, the entire column of that number is filled with that number in the output. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2 is at row 2, column 2. In the output, the third column (index 2) is all 2s? No, looking at the output rows for Example 0:\n\nEach row in the output where the input row had 0, the output row has 0s except for column 2 being 2. Wait no. Wait in output rows 0 and 1, the third element is 2, but other columns are 0. So maybe for the 2 in input, all the rows that are in the same column as the 2 (column 2) have their entries in column 2 set to 2, except for the rows where higher numbers take precedence. But the 3 and 1 are in their rows. Hmm, but in the output, the row with 3 (row 4) is all 3s, which would overwrite the 2 in column 2. Similarly, the row with 1 (row 6) is all 1s.\n\nWait perhaps the pattern is:\n\nEach non-zero number in the input grid affects certain rows in the output. For each number n in the input, the output will have all the rows that are in the same row as the number n in the input filled with n. But in Example 0, the 2 is in row 2, but the output has multiple rows filled with 2 in column 2. Wait no. Alternatively, perhaps each non-zero number in the input causes the corresponding column in all rows to be filled with that number, except for rows that have their own non-zero numbers. For example, in Example 0, the 2 in column 2 makes all rows have 2 in column 2 unless they are overwritten by a higher priority number (like 3 or 1). But how are the priorities determined? Because in the output, the 3 and 1 rows are completely filled with their numbers, which would overwrite the column 2's 2. So maybe the numbers have a priority order where higher numbers take precedence. But in Example 0, 3 is higher than 2 and 1. But in the output, the 1 is in row 6, which is filled with 1s. But 1 is lower than 3, but that row is filled with 1. Hmm, maybe the priority is based on the row order. Wait, perhaps each number in the input affects all rows below it (or above) in its column. Wait, perhaps each non-zero number n in the input grid propagates upwards or downwards in their column, filling all the cells in that column with n, but when a higher number is present, it takes precedence. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 is in row 2, column 2. The output has column 2 filled with 2s except for rows where there's a higher number. The 3 is in row 4, column 7. So in column 7, all rows would be 3s? But in the output, row 4 is all 3s. But other rows in column 7 are 0 except for row 4. Wait, no. The output's row 4 is all 3s. So maybe for each number in the input, the entire row where it's located is filled with that number in the output. Then, for other rows, if there's a number in their column from a higher row (or lower?), it's filled. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the input act as \"sources\" that spread their values to adjacent rows in their column. For example, a number n in (row r, column c) will fill all rows in column c with n, starting from r and spreading upwards and downwards until another number is encountered. But let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 is in row 2, column 2. The output for column 2 in all rows is 2 except for rows 4 (filled with 3) and 6 (filled with 1). So the 2 spreads up and down until it hits a row with a higher number. But in the output, rows 0-3, 5,7,8 in column 2 are 2. Row 4 is 3, row 6 is 1. So perhaps the numbers in the input \"block\" the spread of lower numbers. So for each column, the highest number in that column fills all rows in the output for that column, unless there's a higher number in between.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, column 2 has only a 2. So all rows in column 2 would be 2. But row 4 and 6 are filled with 3 and 1, respectively. So perhaps when a row is filled with a number (like 3 in row 4), that entire row is filled, overriding any column values. So the priority is: if a row in the output is filled with a number (like 3 in row 4), then that row's entries are all that number. Otherwise, for each column, use the highest number in that column from the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are determined by the numbers in their row. If the row in the input has a non-zero number, then the entire output row is filled with that number. If the row in the input has all zeros, then each cell in the output row is the maximum number present in that column in the input. Wait, this seems possible. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nTake Example 0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 2 has 2. Output row 2 is filled with 2? No, output row 2 is [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, that's not filled with 2. Hmm. So that theory is wrong.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for each row. If the input row has a non-zero number, the output row is filled with that number. Otherwise, the output row's entries are the maximum number present in their respective columns from the input. But in Example 0, let's check.\n\nIn input, the non-zero numbers are at (2,2)=2, (4,7)=3, (6,3)=1.\n\nFor output rows:\n\nRow 0: All zeros except column 2 (2). So the maximum in column 0 is 0, column 1 is 0, column 2 is 2, etc. So for each column, the max in that column from the input is taken. So the output row is the maximum of each column. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0: all zeros.\n\nColumn 1: all zeros.\n\nColumn 2: has a 2 in row 2. So max is 2.\n\nColumn 3: has a 1 in row 6. So max is 1.\n\nColumn 4: all zeros.\n\nColumn 5: all zeros.\n\nColumn 6: all zeros.\n\nColumn 7: has a 3 in row 4. So max is 3.\n\nSo, if the output rows that are all zeros in input take the max of each column, then for row 0, the output would be [0,0,2,1,0,0,0,3,0], which does not match the example. Hmm, that's not right.\n\nBut in the output of example 0, row 0 is [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0], so only column 2 is 2. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps for rows that are empty (all zeros) in the input, their output is the same as the nearest non-zero row below or above. For example, in Example 0, row 0 is empty. The nearest non-zero row below is row 2 (with 2). So maybe row 0's output is filled with 2 in column 2, and others zero. But how does that apply to other rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each column, the output is the number present in the first non-zero cell when moving upwards from the bottom. Or maybe the highest number in that column. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, column 2 has a 2. So in the output, all rows in column 2 are 2 except where overridden by a filled row (like row 4 filled with 3, which would overwrite column 2 to 3, but in the output, row 4 is all 3s, so column 2 in row 4 is 3. But the other rows in column 2 are 2. So maybe the filled rows (those with non-zero in input) take precedence, and for the other rows, each column's value is the highest number in that column. But in that case, column 3 in example 0's input has a 1, so in all other rows (except row 6 which is filled with 1), column 3 would have 1. But in the output, row 0's column 3 is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the outputs, each filled row (with all the same number) corresponds to a row in the input that contained that number. For example, in Example 0's input, row 6 has 1, so output row 6 is filled with 1. Similarly, row 4 (input has 3) is filled with 3. The other rows in the output have some numbers in certain columns. Let's check those columns. For example, in the output of Example 0, columns 2, 3, and 7 have numbers. But the input has 2 in column 2, 3 in column 7, and 1 in column 3. Hmm, perhaps the filled rows are for the rows that have a number in the input. The other rows in the output have, in each column, the maximum number from the input in that column, but only in the columns that are not occupied by a filled row. Wait, maybe the filled rows are overriding their entire row, and the other rows take the maximum value of each column from the input. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0: all 0.\n\nColumn 1: all 0.\n\nColumn 2: has a 2 (row 2). So max is 2.\n\nColumn 3: has a 1 (row 6). So max is 1.\n\nColumn 4: all 0.\n\nColumn 5: all 0.\n\nColumn 6: all 0.\n\nColumn 7: has 3 (row4). Max is 3.\n\nColumn 8: all 0.\n\nSo for rows that are not filled (i.e., rows not having a non-zero in the input), their output should be the max of each column. So for row 0, which is empty in input, the output row would be [0,0,2,1,0,0,0,3,0]. But in the actual output, row 0 is [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So that doesn't match. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nLooking again at the outputs:\n\nIn Example 0's output, all rows except row4 and row6 have 2 in column2, 0 elsewhere. Row4 is all3, row6 is all1. The input has 2 in row2, column2. So why are other rows getting 2 in column2? Maybe the 2 in column2 is propagating upwards and downwards, but only in the same column. But why are other columns not affected?\n\nWait, maybe the non-zero numbers in the input are acting like \"sources\" that fill their entire column with their value, unless interrupted by a filled row (a row that in the input has a non-zero). For example, the 2 in column2 of row2 would fill all rows in column2 with 2, except for rows that are filled (like row4 and row6) which are filled with their own numbers, thus overriding column2's value.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\n1. For each row in the input, if there is a non-zero number, fill the entire row in the output with that number.\n2. For the remaining rows (those with all zeros in input), for each column, check if there's a non-zero number in that column in the input. If so, use the maximum number present in that column. Wait, but in example0, column2 has 2, so all empty rows would have 2 in column2. But in the output of example0, the empty rows do have 2 in column2, and other columns are 0. So perhaps for empty rows, each column is filled with the maximum number in that column from the input, but only if there are any numbers in that column.\n\nBut in example0, column3 has 1 in input (row6), but in the empty rows, column3 is 0. Except in row6, which is filled with 1. Wait, that's conflicting. So maybe it's not the maximum, but the first non-zero number encountered in the column when moving from that row upwards or downwards.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the filled rows split the grid into regions. For example, in column2, the 2 in row2 would fill all rows except those that are filled with higher numbers. So rows above and below the filled row (row2) in column2 are filled with 2 until another filled row is encountered. Let's see:\n\nIn example0's column2:\n\nRow2 has 2. The filled rows are row4 (3) and row6 (1). So between row2 and row4 (rows 3), the column2 would be 2. Between row4 and row6, rows5 would be 2, but row6 is filled with 1, so row6's column2 is 1. Below row6, rows7 and 8 have column2 as 2 again. Wait, but the output for rows0-3,5,7,8 have column2 as 2, and row4 has 3 (filled), row6 has 1 (filled). So perhaps the filled rows (row4 and row6) block the spread of 2 in column2, but only in their own rows.\n\nHmm, but how does this explain the other columns. For example, in column7 of example0's input, there's a 3 in row4. So the output's row4 is filled with 3. The other rows in column7 are 0 except row4. But why isn't column7 filled with 3 in all rows? Because according to the pattern, the 3 in column7 would fill all rows in column7 with 3. But in the output, only row4 is filled with 3. So that's not happening. So maybe the filled rows override the column values. So the 3 in row4's column7 is part of a filled row (entire row is 3), so column7 in other rows is 0. But why are other columns not filled with their respective numbers.\n\nAlternatively, the filled rows take precedence, and the columns are filled only in the rows that are not filled. So for example, the 2 in column2 fills all non-filled rows in column2. The filled rows (like row4 and row6) have their own numbers. So the output for a column is the number in the input's column, but only in rows that are not part of a filled row.\n\nBut how are the numbers in the columns determined? For example, in example0's column2, only row2 has 2. So in the output, all non-filled rows in column2 have 2. The filled rows (row4 and row6) have their own numbers. So yes, that seems to fit. So the steps are:\n\n1. For each row in the input that has a non-zero number, fill the entire row in the output with that number.\n2. For the remaining rows (all zeros in input), in each column, check if there's a non-zero number in that column in the input. If so, set that cell in the output to the number from the input's column. If multiple numbers are present in the column, perhaps take the maximum or the highest one.\n\nWait, but in example0's column3, the input has a 1 in row6. So in the output, all non-filled rows in column3 should have 1. But looking at the output of example0, row0's column3 is 0. So that's not matching. So maybe this theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the filled rows are those where the input row has a non-zero, and they fill their entire row with that number. Then, for the other rows, each cell is the maximum number in their respective column from the input. But in example0, the column2 has 2. So all non-filled rows in column2 would have 2. Column3 has 1. So all non-filled rows in column3 would have 1. Column7 has 3. So all non-filled rows in column7 would have 3.\n\nSo the output rows that are not filled would have:\n\nFor row0: [max of each column]. Max column0 is 0, column1 0, column2 2, column3 1, column4 0, column5 0, column6 0, column7 3, column8 0. So row0 would be [0,0,2,1,0,0,0,3,0]. But the actual output row0 is [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't match. Hence, this theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example1's input and output:\n\nExample1 input has 3 in row1, column1 and row4, column3. 1 in row6, column1. 2 in row7, column5.\n\nOutput:\n\nRows with 3 are filled with 3s (row1 and row4). The row with 1 is filled with 1s (row6). The row with 2 is filled with 2s? No, row7 in output is [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. Wait, that's not filled. So in example1's output, the row with 2 in the input (row7) is not filled with 2s, but only has 2 in column5. So that contradicts the previous assumption.\n\nWait, in example1's input, row7 has 2 in column5. The output for row7 is [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. So the entire row is not filled. So the previous idea that input rows with non-zero numbers have their entire row filled is incorrect. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the filled rows are those where the input row contains a number, but only if that number is the first occurrence in its column. Or perhaps it's about the position of the number. For example, in example1's input, row7 has a 2 in column5. The output for row7 has 2 in column5, but the rest are zeros. So why is this?\n\nLooking at example1's output:\n\nThe output for row7 is [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. Also, other rows in column5 have 2. For instance, row0 in output has [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. So column5 has 2s in many rows. So perhaps the 2 in row7's column5 is causing all rows in column5 to have 2, except filled rows. But row7's output is not filled, so column5 in row7 is 2. But why aren't other columns in row7 filled with 2?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to see another pattern.\n\nLooking at example2's input and output:\n\nIn example2's input, the numbers are:\n\nRow1 has 1 in column1.\n\nRow3 has 3 in column8.\n\nRow6 has 3 in column2.\n\nRow8 has 2 in column3.\n\nRow9 has 2 in column9.\n\nThe output has rows filled with 1, 3, 3, 2, etc. For example, row1 is filled with 1. Rows3 and6 are filled with3. Rows8 and9 have 2 in column3 and9.\n\nWait, in the output, row1 is filled with1, row3 is filled with3, row6 is filled with3, row8 and9 have 2s in columns3 and9. Also, columns3 and9 have 2s in other rows. So perhaps the filled rows are those where the input row has a number, and the entire row is filled with that number. Then, in other rows, each column is filled with the highest number present in that column from the input. So, for example, in column3 of example2's input, there's a 2 in row8. So in the output, all rows (except filled rows) in column3 have 2. Similarly, column9 has a 2 in row9, so other rows' column9 have 2. But in the output of example2, row0's column3 is 2 and column9 is0. Wait, the output of example2's row0 is [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0]. So column3 and9 have 2s. But in the input, column3 has a 2 in row8, and column9 has a 2 in row9. So maybe for each column, the highest number in that column from the input is propagated to all rows except those filled rows. Let's test this.\n\nIn example2's input:\n\nColumn3 has 2 (row8), column9 has 2 (row9). So all rows except filled rows should have 2 in those columns. But in the output, row0's column9 is 2, but row9 is filled with 2 in column9. Wait, the filled rows are those where the input row has a number. So row9's input has a 2 in column9, so row9 in the output is filled with 2? No, in example2's output, row9 is [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0], not filled with 2. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the filled rows are those where the input has a number in any column, and the entire row is filled with that number. For example, in example0's input, row2 has 2, so output row2 is filled with 2. But in example0's output, row2 is [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0], which is not filled. So this theory is also incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe the filled rows are those that have a number in the input, but only if that number is the maximum in its column. Let's see.\n\nIn example0, the 3 in column7 is the only number there, so row4 is filled with3. The 1 in column3 is the only number there, so row6 is filled with1. The 2 in column2 is the only number there, so row2 is filled with2. But in example0's output, row2 is [0,0,2,0,...], which is not filled. So this theory is not working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero number in the input causes the entire row and column to be filled with that number. But in example0, the 2 in row2, column2 would fill row2 and column2 with 2s. But in the output, row2 is not filled with 2s. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output, each number in the input creates a horizontal line (entire row) and/or vertical line (entire column) in the output. For example, in example0's output, the 3 is in row4, which is filled with3s (horizontal line), and the 2 in column2 has a vertical line of 2s. The 1 is in row6 filled with1s (horizontal line). The vertical line for 2 is column2 filled with 2s except where intersected by horizontal lines. Similarly, in example1's output, the vertical line for 2 is column5 filled with 2s except where horizontal lines (filled rows) are present.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\nFor each non-zero number n at (r, c) in the input:\n\n- Fill the entire row r with n (horizontal line).\n- Fill the entire column c with n (vertical line).\n\nBut when multiple numbers are in the same row or column, the highest number takes precedence. Or the latest one? Wait, in example0's input, the 3 is in row4, which is filled with3s (horizontal line). The column7 (where the 3 is) would be filled with3s vertically, but in the output, column7 only has3s in row4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, when a number is in the input, the entire row is filled with that number, and other numbers in the same row would override. But this seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, in example0's input, row2 has a 2. Output row2 is [0,0,2,0,...]. So the entire row is not filled. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: the output has filled rows for some numbers, and other rows have certain columns filled. For example, in example0's output:\n\n- Row4 is filled with3s.\n- Row6 is filled with1s.\n- All other rows have 2 in column2.\n\nThe 2 in the input is at row2, column2. So perhaps, for any number in the input, the entire column is filled with that number except for rows that are filled with a higher number. And the filled rows are those where the number is the highest in their row.\n\nAlternatively, the filled rows are those where the number in the input is the highest in their respective column. For example, in example0's column2, 2 is the only number, so row2 becomes filled. But in example0's output, row2 isn't filled. So no.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to find the commonalities between the examples.\n\nLooking at example0's input and output:\n\nInput has 3 numbers: 2,3,1.\n\nOutput has three filled rows: row4 (3), row6 (1), and row2 (not filled). Wait, row2's output is [0,0,2,0,...], which is not filled. So the filled rows are those where the input number is the maximum in their column. Wait, 3 is in column7, which has no other numbers. 1 is in column3, which has no other numbers. 2 is in column2, which has no others. So why are the filled rows only 3 and 1, but not 2? Because in the output, row4 is filled with3, row6 with1. So perhaps the filled rows are those where the number is the maximum in their respective rows. But in example0, row2 has 2, which is the only number in that row, so it's the max. But the output row2 is not filled. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: compare the positions of the numbers in the input and their corresponding filled rows in the output.\n\nIn example0's input, the numbers are at rows 2 (2),4 (3),6 (1). The output's filled rows are 4 and6. The row2 in the output is not filled. So perhaps the filled rows are those where the number is in a certain position, like even or odd rows. No, row4 and6 are even (assuming 0-based) but row2 is even as well.\n\nAnother idea: the filled rows are those where the number is the highest in the input. In example0, the numbers are 2,3,1. 3 is the highest, so row4 is filled. 1 is the lowest, so row6 is filled. But why is row2 not filled? This doesn't explain.\n\nAlternatively, filled rows are determined by the number's parity. For example, even numbers are filled, but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at example1's output:\n\nThe filled rows are row1 (3), row4 (3), row6 (1). The input has 3 in row1 and row4, 1 in row6, and 2 in row7. The output filled rows are 3,3,1. So filled rows are those with numbers in the input, but the output row is filled with that number regardless of its value. But in example1's output, row7's output is not filled, even though the input has a 2 there. So that theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, filled rows are those where the number is in a column that's the only non-zero in their row. For example, in example0's input, row2 has only 2, row4 has only3, row6 has only1. So their output rows are filled. But in example1's input, row7 has 2 in column5, but there are other numbers in that row? No, example1's input row7 has only 2 in column5. So why is the output row7 not filled with 2?\n\nWait in example1's output, row7 is [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0], which is not filled. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Let me try to look for another pattern. Perhaps the filled rows are those where the number in the input is the highest in the entire grid. For example, in example0, 3 is the highest number, so row4 is filled. But 2 and 1 are also present, but their rows are not filled. So why is row6 filled with1? Because 1 is the only number in its row. No, this doesn't hold.\n\nAnother observation: in example0's output, the filled rows (4 and6) are the ones where the input number is in the same row as the output filled row. The other numbers in the input (row2's 2) have their column filled with their number. So perhaps the rule is: if a number in the input is the only number in its row, then fill the entire row with that number. Otherwise, fill the column with the number. But example0's row2 has only 2, but the output row is not filled. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the input are in certain positions that allow their rows to be filled. For example, if a number is in a row where there are no other numbers in its column, then fill the row. Otherwise, fill the column. But this is not clear.\n\nPerhaps the filled rows are determined by the order of the numbers. For example, the highest number in the grid gets their row filled, and other numbers fill their columns. But in example0, 3 is the highest, so row4 is filled with3. 1 is lower than 2, but row6 is filled with1. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, numbers that are in even rows get their rows filled, others fill their columns. No, example0's row4 is even, row6 is even. Row2 is even but not filled. So no.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let me try to think differently.\n\nLooking at the output for each example:\n\nThe filled rows have the same number repeated in all columns. The other rows have some columns filled with numbers. For example, in example0's output:\n\nRows 0,1,3,5,7,8 have 2 in column2. Row4 has 3s. Row6 has 1s. So perhaps the numbers in the input are causing their entire column to be filled with their number, except in rows that are filled with a higher number. And the filled rows are those where the number is the highest in their column.\n\nBut how does this work for example0's column3, which has a 1 in row6. The output row6 is filled with 1s, so column3 in row6 is 1. Other rows' column3 are 0. So the 1 in column3 would only affect row6, which is filled. But in other rows, column3 is 0, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the filled rows are those where the number in the input is the first in their column. So, in column2 of example0, the first (top-most) number is 2 in row2. So the output fills all rows in column2 with 2, except those that have a filled row. But why row2 in the output isn't filled?\n\nWait, maybe the filled rows are those where the number is the last in their column (bottom-most). Let's see. In example0's column2, the only number is in row2. So filled rows are determined by the bottom-most number in each column. But example0's row2 is not filled in the output. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The filled rows are those where the number in the input is the only one in their column. For example, in example0's column2 has only 2. So row2 is filled. But no, the output row2 is not filled. So this is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the filled rows are determined by the number's value. For example, if the number is 3, its row is filled with 3s. If the number is 1 or 2, their column is filled. But in example0, the 3's row is filled, the 2 and 1's columns are filled. But in example1's input, there's a 3 in row1 and row4. Both of these rows are filled with 3s. The 1 in row6 is filled with 1s. The 2 in row7's column5 fills column5 with 2s. So this could be the pattern.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\n- For each number in the input:\n   - If the number is 3, fill its entire row with 3s.\n   - If the number is 1 or 2, fill their entire column with their respective numbers, except for rows that are already filled with a higher number.\n\nBut why in example0's input, the 2's column is filled with 2s, and the 1's column is filled with 1s. But in example0's output, the column3 (with 1) is only filled in row6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, numbers 3 and 1 fill their rows, and 2 fills their columns. But in example1, the 2 fills column5. In example0, 2 fills column2. In example2, the 2s fill column3 and9. The 3s fill their rows, and 1 fills its row.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is:\n\n- Numbers 1 and 3, when present in the input, cause their entire row to be filled with that number.\n- Numbers 2, when present in the input, cause their entire column to be filled with 2.\n\nBut in example0's input, 3 is present, so its row is filled. 1 is present, so its row is filled. 2 is present, so its column is filled. This fits the output.\n\nIn example1's input, there are two 3s, so their rows are filled. The 1's row is filled. The 2's column is filled with 2s. The output matches this.\n\nIn example2's input, there are two 3s (row3 and row6), so their rows are filled with 3s. The 1 in row1's column1 fills its row with 1. The 2s in column3 and9 fill those columns with 2s. The output matches this.\n\nYes, this seems to fit all the examples. So the pattern is:\n\n- For each number in the input grid:\n   - If the number is 1 or 3, the entire row of that number is filled with the number in the output.\n   - If the number is 2, the entire column of that number is filled with 2 in the output.\n   - If a cell is affected by multiple numbers (e.g., a cell in a filled row and a filled column), the filled row takes precedence over the column. Because, for example, in example0's row4 (filled with 3), the column2's 2 is overridden by the row's 3.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nLet's look at the test input:\n\nThe input is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, identify all numbers and their positions:\n\n- Row0, column3: 3 \u2192 filled row0 with3.\n- Row1, column9: 2 \u2192 filled column9 with2.\n- Row3, column5:3 \u2192 filled row3 with3.\n- Row5, column4:2 \u2192 filled column4 with2.\n- Row7, column1:1 \u2192 filled row7 with1.\n- Row9, column8:1 \u2192 filled row9 with1.\n\nSo the filled rows are row0 (3), row3 (3), row7 (1), row9 (1).\n\nThe filled columns are:\n\n- column4 (from row5's 2).\n- column9 (from row1's 2).\n\nNow, construct the output:\n\nFor each row:\n\n- If the row is filled (0,3,7,9), fill it with the respective number.\n- For other rows:\n   - In column4, fill with 2.\n   - In column9, fill with2.\n   - All other columns are 0.\n\nSo let's go row by row:\n\nRow0: filled with3 \u2192 [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nRow1: not filled. Columns4 and9 are 2. Others are 0. So [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0].\n\nRow2: not filled. Columns4 and9 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0].\n\nRow3: filled with3 \u2192 [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nRow4: not filled \u2192 columns4 and9 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0].\n\nRow5: not filled. But wait, row5 has a 2 in column4. So according to the pattern, this 2 causes column4 to be filled with2. But row5 itself is not filled. So row5's output is [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0].\n\nRow6: not filled \u2192 columns4 and9 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0].\n\nRow7: filled with1 \u2192 [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nRow8: not filled \u2192 columns4 and9 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0].\n\nRow9: filled with1 \u2192 [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nRow10: not filled \u2192 columns4 and9 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0].\n\nRow11: not filled \u2192 columns4 and9 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0].\n\nBut wait, in the test input, row9 has 1 in column8, so the entire row9 is filled with1. So yes, row9's output is all 1s.\n\nLet me check the filled columns:\n\nColumn4: filled with2 from row5's 2. So every row (except filled rows) will have 2 in column4.\n\nColumn9: filled with2 from row1's 2. So every row (except filled rows) will have 2 in column9.\n\nThus, the test output should look like:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow3: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow7: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow9: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow11: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nThis matches the pattern observed in the training examples. So the final answer should be in this format.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples, and then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by analyzing the training examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 0. The input has a 2 in the third row, third column (assuming rows start at 0). The output shows that the entire row where 2 was located becomes all 2s, but wait, no. Wait, in the output of example 0, the third row (index 2) is all 2s except for the first and last elements? Wait no, looking at the output:\n\nIn example 0's output, row 0 is [0,0,2,0,...], row 1 is same, row 2 is same. Wait, no. Wait the output for example 0 is:\n\nThe output rows are:\n\n[0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n[0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n[0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, the input has 2 in row 2, column 2 (0-based). Then the output's rows 0-3, 5,7-8 all have a 2 in the third position. So maybe each row where there's a 2 in the input, that column in the output's row is filled with 2? Not sure. Let's check other elements. The input also has a 3 in row 4, column 7. The output row 4 is all 3s. Then there's a 1 in row 6, column 3. The output row 6 is all 1s.\n\nAh! So maybe, for each number in the input grid (non-zero), the entire corresponding row in the output is filled with that number. But wait, in example 0's input, the 2 is in row 2, column 2. The output has multiple rows (like rows 0,1,2,3,5,7,8) with 2 in the third position. Wait, but how does that relate? Maybe it's not about the row, but about the column. Let me see:\n\nIn example 0's input, the 2 is in column 2. Then in the output, all the rows that are in the same column as the 2 (column 2) have 2 in that column. Wait, but in the output, rows 0-3,5,7,8 have a 2 in column 2. But the input's 2 is in row 2. So perhaps the output is such that for each non-zero number in the input grid, that number's row in the output is filled with that number. But in example 0, the 2 is in row 2, so output row 2 is [0,0,2,...] but in the output, row 4 is all 3s, which matches the input's 3 in row 4. Similarly, the 1 in row 6 leads to row 6 being all 1s. But wait, the other rows in the output have 2 in column 2. That's confusing. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero number in the input causes certain rows in the output to be filled. Let's look at example 1's input and output.\n\nIn example 1's input, there's a 3 in row 1, column 1, another 3 in row 4, column 3. Then in the output, rows 1 and 4 are all 3s. The 1 is in row 6, column 1, so the output's row 6 is all 1s. The 2 is in row 7, column 5, so output row 7 has a 2 in column 5. But wait, the output for example 1's rows where 2 is present (like row 0,3, etc.) have 2 in column 5. So maybe each non-zero number in the input creates a horizontal line (entire row) in the output at the same row as the input number, filled with that number. Then any overlapping numbers from different rows would take precedence based on some order. Wait, but in example 0, the 2 is in row 2, column 2, but the output row 2 has 2 only in column 2. Wait, that contradicts that idea. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back at example 0's output, the row 4 (input's 3) is all 3s. The row 6 (input's 1) is all 1s. The other rows have 2s in column 2. So perhaps each non-zero number in the input sets its entire row to that number. But for the 2 in row 2, column 2, why are other rows (like rows 0,1,3,5,7,8) having a 2 in column 2? Maybe that's a vertical line through the column of the 2.\n\nSo combining these two ideas: any non-zero number in the input grid causes two things:\n\n1. The entire row of that number is filled with the number.\n\n2. The entire column of that number is filled with the number.\n\nBut in example 0, the 2 is in row 2, column 2. So the output's row 2 would be all 2s (but in example 0's output, row 2 is [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0], which is not all 2s. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps the row and column are filled, but only for higher numbers? Or maybe the numbers have a priority. Let's check example 0's output again.\n\nIn example 0's input, the 3 is in row 4, column 7. In the output, row 4 is all 3s. So the entire row is filled with 3. The 1 in row 6, column 3: output row 6 is all 1s. So that seems like the entire row is filled with the number. Then, for the 2 in row 2, column 2: output row 2 is [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, that's not the entire row. Hmm. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers in the input determine the row and column in the output. For example, if there's a number N at (row R, column C), then in the output, all cells in row R and column C are set to N. But if there's a conflict (i.e., a cell is in both a row and column of different numbers), then the highest number takes precedence. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0 input has 2 at (2,2). So output row 2 and column 2 should be 2. 3 at (4,7): row 4 and column 7 set to 3. 1 at (6,3): row 6 and column 3 set to 1.\n\nLooking at example 0's output:\n\n- Row 0: column 2 is 2. So maybe column 2 is set to 2.\n\nRow 0 has [0,0,2,0,...]. So column 2 is 2. Similarly, row 1's column 2 is 2. Row 2's entire row would be 2 if that's the case, but row 2 in output is [0,0,2,...], not all 2s. So that's conflicting. Wait, perhaps the row is not set, but only the column. But the 3's row (4) is all 3s, and the 1's row (6) is all 1s. So maybe the rule is: For each non-zero N in the input, set the entire row of N to N, and the entire column of N to N. But when there's overlapping (e.g., a cell is in both a row and column set by different Ns), then the highest N takes precedence.\n\nIn example 0:\n\nThe 3 is at (4,7). So row 4 is filled with 3s. Column 7 is filled with 3s. The 2 is at (2,2), so column 2 is filled with 2s. But row 2 is not filled with 2s, only column 2. Hmm. So why is row 6 filled with 1s? Because the 1 is in (6,3), so row 6 is filled with 1s, and column 3 is filled with 1s. But in the output, row 6 is all 1s, but column 3 (in other rows) may have 1s? Let's check. For example, in row 6, column 3 is 1. But in row 6, all columns are 1. So row 6 is filled with 1s. Similarly, row 4 is filled with 3s. So for the 3 and 1, their rows are filled. But for the 2, only column 2 is filled. So why the difference?\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is: For each non-zero number N at (R,C), if there are no higher numbers in the same row or column, then fill the entire row and column with N. But if there's a higher number in the same row or column, then maybe only the column is filled. Or perhaps the highest number in the row or column takes precedence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number N in the input causes the entire row and column to be filled with N, but higher numbers overwrite lower ones.\n\nSo, for example, in example 0:\n\n- The 2 at (2,2) would set its row and column to 2. But then the 3 at (4,7) would set row 4 to 3 and column 7 to 3. The 1 at (6,3) sets row 6 to 1 and column 3 to 1. But then, overlapping cells would be overwritten by higher numbers.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nIn example 0's output, row 2 has [0,0,2,0,...], which suggests that only column 2 is set. So perhaps the 2's row is not filled. But why? Maybe because there's a higher number in the same row. Wait, row 2 in the input has 2, but no other numbers. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers in the input represent \"dominant\" rows and columns. The highest number in any row or column determines the fill. Let's think.\n\nFor each row, find the maximum number in that row and fill the entire row with that number. Similarly, for each column, find the maximum number in that column and fill the entire column with that number. Then, for each cell in the output, it's the maximum between the row's maximum and column's maximum.\n\nWait, let's test this with example 0.\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: all zeros. Max 0.\n\nRow 1: all zeros. Max 0.\n\nRow 2: has 2. Max 2.\n\nRow 3: all zeros.\n\nRow 4: has 3. Max 3.\n\nRow 5: all zeros.\n\nRow 6: has 1. Max 1.\n\nRows 7,8: zeros.\n\nSo for rows, the row maximums are:\n\nRow 2: 2 \u2192 entire row filled with 2.\n\nRow 4: 3 \u2192 entire row filled with 3.\n\nRow 6: 1 \u2192 entire row filled with 1.\n\nOther rows have max 0, so unchanged.\n\nNow, for columns:\n\nColumn 0: all zeros except row 4 (3?), no. Wait, in example 0's input, column 0 is all zeros except row 4 (which is row 4, column 7 is 3. So column 0's max is 0.\n\nColumn 2 has 2 (from row 2) and no other numbers. So column max is 2. So entire column 2 filled with 2.\n\nColumn 7 has 3 in row 4. So column 7 filled with 3.\n\nColumn 3 in input has 1 in row 6. So column 3 filled with 1.\n\nBut in example 0's output:\n\nRow 0 has column 2 as 2. So the column's max is applied. But the row's max for row 0 is 0, so the cell (0,2) is 2 (the max of row 0 (0) and column 2 (2)) \u2192 2.\n\nBut according to this rule, each cell would be the maximum of the row's max and column's max. Let's see.\n\nIn example 0's output, for cell (0,2), row 0's max is 0, column 2's max is 2 \u2192 2. So cell (0,2) is 2. Similarly, row 4 is filled with 3 (row's max), overriding column's max (for example, column 7 in row 4 would be 3, which matches the input's 3).\n\nBut then, for row 2, which has max 2, the entire row should be filled with 2. But in the output, row 2 is [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]. That's not the case. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Let's look for another pattern. Let's check example 2.\n\nIn example 2's input, there are:\n\n- 1 in row 1, column 1.\n\n- 3 in row 3, column 8.\n\n- 3 in row 6, column 2.\n\n- 2 in row 8, column 3.\n\n- 2 in row 9, column 9.\n\nOutput for example 2:\n\nRow 1 is all 1s.\n\nRow 3 is all 3s.\n\nRow 6 is all 3s (since there's a 3 in row 6, column 2).\n\nRow 8 has 2 in column 3.\n\nBut the output shows:\n\nRow 1: all 1s.\n\nRow 3: all 3s.\n\nRow 6: all 3s.\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0]. Wait, no, row 8 in the output is [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0], which has 2s in columns 3 and 9. But the input has 2 in row 8, column 3 and row 9, column 9. So maybe each 2 in the input sets their columns to 2. So in example 2's output, columns 3 and 9 (from the 2s in row 8 and 9) are filled with 2s wherever there's no higher priority.\n\nBut then why rows 3 and 6 are filled with 3s? Because the 3s in their rows have higher values than 2. So perhaps the rule is:\n\nFor each cell in the output:\n\n- If there's any number in the same row (in the input) that is the maximum in that row, then the cell is filled with that maximum.\n\n- Otherwise, if there's any number in the same column (in the input) that is the maximum in that column, then the cell is filled with that maximum.\n\n- Otherwise, it remains 0.\n\nBut this may need to be checked.\n\nIn example 0:\n\n- Row 2 has a 2 (max of row is 2). So entire row 2 is filled with 2. But in the output, row 2 is [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So this contradicts. So perhaps the rows are not filled with their max, but only the columns.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each non-zero number in the input causes its entire row to be filled with that number if it's the highest in its row and column. Or maybe the highest number in each row takes precedence for the entire row, and the highest in each column takes precedence for the column. Then overlapping cells take the higher of the two.\n\nLet's try this approach. For each row, find the maximum number in that row. Fill the entire row with that number. For each column, find the maximum number in that column. Fill the entire column with that number. Then, for each cell, take the maximum between the row's fill and the column's fill.\n\nWait, let's see example 0.\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 2: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 max is 2 \u2192 fill row 2 with 2.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0] \u2192 max is 3 \u2192 fill row 4 with 3.\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 max is 1 \u2192 fill row 6 with 1.\n\nOther rows have max 0.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 2: in input, row 2 has 2 \u2192 max 2 \u2192 fill column 2 with 2.\n\nColumn 3: row 6 has 1 \u2192 max 1 \u2192 fill column 3 with 1.\n\nColumn 7: row 4 has 3 \u2192 fill column 7 with 3.\n\nOther columns have max 0.\n\nSo, for each cell, the output would be the maximum between the row's fill and column's fill. Let's check:\n\nRow 0: row fill is 0. Column 2 has fill 2. So cell (0,2) is max(0,2)=2. The rest of the row's cells are 0 (row fill) unless their column has a higher fill. So in row 0, only column 2 is 2. Which matches the output.\n\nRow 2: row fill is 2. Column fill for column 2 is 2. So entire row would be 2, but in the output, row 2 is [0,0,2,0,...]. That's conflicting. So this theory is wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. Maybe the rows and columns are filled with the highest number present in them, and the cell is the maximum between the row's maximum and the column's maximum. Let's see example 0:\n\nRow 0's maximum: 0. Column 2's maximum: 2 \u2192 cell (0,2) is 2.\n\nRow 2's row maximum: 2. Column 2's maximum: 2. So entire row 2 should be 2, but output shows only column 2 as 2 and others 0. So this doesn't align.\n\nMaybe the output is constructed by, for each cell (R,C), if there exists a number N in row R or column C of the input, then the maximum N among those is the cell's value.\n\nFor example, in example 0:\n\nCell (0,0): no numbers in row 0 or column 0 \u2192 0.\n\nCell (0,2): in column 2, which has 2 (from row 2) \u2192 2.\n\nCell (2,0): in row 2, which has 2 \u2192 2. But in the output, cell (2,0) is 0. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each cell (R,C) in the output, the value is the maximum of all numbers in row R and column C of the input.\n\nSo for example, in cell (R,C), look at all non-zero numbers in row R of the input and all non-zero numbers in column C of the input, and take the maximum of those.\n\nLet's test this with example 0.\n\nRow 2, column 0: row 2 has 2 (input) and column 0 has nothing. So max is 2. But in output, cell (2,0) is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's the maximum number in the entire row or column of the input. Let's try.\n\nExample 0, row 2 has 2 (max is 2), column 0 has max 0. So cell (2,0) would be 2, but output shows 0. So that's not correct.\n\nLet's look for another angle. Maybe each non-zero number in the input creates a cross (its row and column) filled with that number, but higher numbers override lower ones.\n\nFor example, in example 0:\n\nThe 2 at (2,2) fills row 2 and column 2 with 2. But then the 3 at (4,7) fills row 4 and column 7 with 3. The 1 at (6,3) fills row 6 and column 3 with 1. Then, cells that are in both a row and column of different numbers take the higher number.\n\nIn example 0's output:\n\nRow 4 is all 3s (since it's filled by the 3 in row 4), column 7 is 3, but other cells in row 4 are 3, overriding any previous fills. Similarly, row 6 is all 1s. Now, for row 2 and column 2:\n\nRow 2 would be filled with 2, but in the output, only column 2 is 2, and other cells in row 2 are 0. That's conflicting. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero number N in the input creates a horizontal line (row) and a vertical line (column) filled with N. However, higher N values overwrite lower ones where they overlap.\n\nSo for example, in example 0:\n\n- 2 at (2,2): fills row 2 and column 2 with 2.\n\n- 3 at (4,7): fills row 4 and column 7 with 3.\n\n- 1 at (6,3): fills row 6 and column 3 with 1.\n\nBut then, overlapping areas would have the highest N.\n\nBut how does this apply to row 0, column 2? The 2's column 2 is filled with 2, so row 0, column 2 is 2. There's no higher number there, so it's 2. Similarly, row 4's column 7 is 3. But in row 4's other columns, they are filled with 3. So row 4 is all 3s. But the 3 is only in column 7 of the input. So why is the entire row 4 filled with 3s?\n\nAh! Because the 3 is in row 4, so according to this rule, the entire row 4 is filled with 3. Similarly, the entire column 7 is filled with 3. So the rule is: For each non-zero N in the input, fill the entire row and entire column of that cell with N. Then, if multiple Ns affect the same cell, the highest N takes precedence.\n\nSo let's re-examine example 0:\n\nThe 2 at (2,2) causes row 2 and column 2 to be filled with 2.\n\nThe 3 at (4,7) causes row 4 and column 7 to be filled with 3.\n\nThe 1 at (6,3) causes row 6 and column 3 to be filled with 1.\n\nBut when two numbers affect the same cell, higher numbers override lower ones.\n\nSo, let's see cell (4,2). Row 4 is filled with 3 (from the 3 in row 4), and column 2 is filled with 2 (from the 2 in column 2). Since 3 > 2, cell (4,2) is 3.\n\nSimilarly, cell (6,3) is filled with 1 from both row and column. So it's 1.\n\nCell (2,7): row 2 is 2, column 7 is 3. So 3 > 2 \u2192 cell is 3.\n\nBut looking at example 0's output:\n\nRow 4 is [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3], which makes sense because row 4 is filled with 3. Any column overlaps would have higher values, but since 3 is the highest in the input, any cells in row 4 are 3.\n\nRow 2, however, is [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But according to this rule, row 2 should be filled with 2, but the output shows only column 2 as 2. This suggests that the initial theory is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is different. Maybe only the column is filled with the number, not the row. But then why are rows 4 and 6 filled in the outputs.\n\nWait, in example 0's output, row 4 is filled with 3. So the entire row is 3. Row 6 is filled with 1. So maybe if a number is the highest in its row, it fills the row. Otherwise, only the column is filled. Or perhaps numbers fill their own row if they are the maximum in their row, and columns otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each number fills its entire row if it's the highest in its row, and fills its entire column if it's the highest in its column.\n\nBut in example 0's input, the 2 in row 2 is the only number in its row, so it's the maximum. So row 2 should be filled with 2. But the output doesn't show that. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the training examples:\n\n- In example 0's output, all instances of non-zero numbers in the input have their rows filled with the number. The 3's row is filled with 3, the 1's row filled with 1. But the 2's row is not filled. Instead, the column of the 2 is filled.\n\nAh! Wait, the 2 in example 0's input is at row 2, column 2. In the output, the entire column 2 is filled with 2. But the row 2 is not filled. Why? What's the difference between the 2 and the 3 and 1?\n\nThe 3 is in row 4, column 7. The output's row 4 is filled with 3. The column 7 is filled with 3.\n\nThe 1 is in row 6, column 3. The output's row 6 is filled with 1. The column 3 is filled with 1.\n\nSo, why do 3 and 1 fill their rows, but the 2 fills its column? The only difference is that 3 and 1 are the highest numbers in their respective rows and columns. Let's check:\n\nIn example 0's input:\n\n- The 3 is the only number in its row (row 4) and column (column 7). So it's the maximum in both.\n\n- The 1 is the only number in its row (row 6) and column (column 3). So it's the maximum.\n\n- The 2 is the only number in its row (row 2) and column (column 2). So it's the maximum in both.\n\nBut in the output, the row 2 is not filled with 2. Instead, the column 2 is filled with 2. This contradicts the earlier pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers fill their row if they are the maximum in their row, and their column if they are the maximum in their column. Let's see.\n\nIn example 0:\n\n- 2 is in row 2 and column 2. It's the maximum in both. So row 2 and column 2 should be filled with 2. But in the output, row 2 is not filled. Only column 2 is filled.\n\n- 3 is in row 4 and column 7. Max in both. So row and column filled with 3.\n\n- 1 is in row 6 and column 3. Max in both. So row and column filled with 1.\n\nSo why is row 2 not filled? The output's row 2 has only column 2 filled. This suggests that the row isn't filled. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the numbers fill their column if they are the maximum in their column, and their row if they are the maximum in their row. For example, 3 is the maximum in row 4 and column 7, so both are filled. 1 is the maximum in row 6 and column 3. But 2 is the maximum in row 2 and column 2. So both should be filled. But in the output, row 2 is not filled. This doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers with odd values fill their rows, even values fill their columns. But 3 is odd, fills row; 1 is odd, fills row; 2 is even, fills column. Let's check example 1.\n\nIn example 1's input: 3, 3, 1, 2.\n\nOutput:\n\n- 3's rows (1 and 4) are filled with 3.\n\n- 1's row (6) filled with 1.\n\n- 2 is in row 7, column 5. The output's column 5 is filled with 2 in multiple rows.\n\nSo perhaps even numbers fill columns, odd numbers fill rows. Let's see:\n\nIn example 0:\n\n- 2 (even) \u2192 fills column 2.\n\n- 3 (odd) \u2192 fills row 4.\n\n- 1 (odd) \u2192 fills row 6.\n\nThis seems to fit. But why is row 4 filled with 3? Because 3 is odd, so it fills its row. But 3's column (7) is filled with 3, which is odd. So perhaps it's columns as well. No, in example 0's output, column 7 is filled with 3. So this theory may not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps even and odd numbers behave differently. Even numbers fill their columns, odd numbers fill their rows. Let's check:\n\nExample 0:\n\n- 2 (even) \u2192 column 2 filled.\n\n- 3 (odd) \u2192 row 4 filled.\n\n- 1 (odd) \u2192 row 6 filled.\n\nExample 1:\n\n- 3 (odd) \u2192 rows 1 and 4 filled.\n\n- 1 (odd) \u2192 row 6 filled.\n\n- 2 (even) \u2192 column 5 filled.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput has 1 (odd) \u2192 row 1 filled.\n\n3s (odd) \u2192 rows 3 and 6 filled.\n\n2s (even) \u2192 columns 3 and 9 filled.\n\nThis seems to fit the pattern. So the rule is: For each number in the input, if it's even, fill its entire column with that number. If it's odd, fill its entire row with that number.\n\nYes! This seems to explain all the examples.\n\nLet's verify:\n\nExample 0:\n\n- 2 is even \u2192 column 2 filled with 2.\n\n- 3 is odd \u2192 row 4 filled with 3.\n\n- 1 is odd \u2192 row 6 filled with 1.\n\nLooking at the output for example 0:\n\n- Column 2 has 2 in all rows (rows 0-3,5,7,8).\n\n- Row 4 is all 3s.\n\n- Row 6 is all 1s.\n\nThis matches.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput has:\n\n- 3 (odd) at row 1, column 1 \u2192 row 1 filled with 3.\n\n- 3 (odd) at row 4, column 3 \u2192 row 4 filled with 3.\n\n- 1 (odd) at row 6, column 1 \u2192 row 6 filled with 1.\n\n- 2 (even) at row 7, column 5 \u2192 column 5 filled with 2.\n\nIn the output:\n\n- Rows 1 and 4 are filled with 3.\n\n- Row 6 is filled with 1.\n\n- Column 5 has 2 in all rows where other fills haven't taken place (rows 0,3,5,7-9).\n\nThis matches.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput has:\n\n- 1 (odd) at row 1, column 1 \u2192 row 1 filled with 1.\n\n- 3s (odd) at row 3, column 8 and row 6, column 2 \u2192 rows 3 and 6 filled with 3.\n\n- 2s (even) at row 8, column 3 and row 9, column 9 \u2192 columns 3 and 9 filled with 2.\n\nOutput:\n\n- Row 1 is all 1s.\n\n- Rows 3 and 6 are all 3s.\n\n- Columns 3 and 9 have 2s in all rows not covered by odd fills.\n\nYes, this fits.\n\nSo the pattern is: For each number in the input grid, if the number is even, fill its entire column with that number. If the number is odd, fill its entire row with that number. Where multiple numbers affect the same cell, the highest number takes precedence.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nThe test input has 11 rows and 11 columns. Let's list the non-zero elements and determine their type (even/odd):\n\nLooking at each non-zero entry:\n\nRow 0, column 3: 3 \u2192 odd. So fill row 0 with 3.\n\nRow 1, column 9: 2 \u2192 even. Fill column 9 with 2.\n\nRow 3, column 5: 3 \u2192 odd. Fill row 3 with 3.\n\nRow 5, column 4: 2 \u2192 even. Fill column 4 with 2.\n\nRow 7, column 1: 1 \u2192 odd. Fill row 7 with 1.\n\nRow 9, column 8: 1 \u2192 odd. Fill row 9 with 1.\n\nNow, we need to generate the output grid by filling the rows and columns as per the rules, and for each cell, take the highest number between any row fill or column fill.\n\nLet's process each row and column:\n\nFirst, identify all the rows to be filled:\n\n- Row 0: filled with 3 (from the 3 in row 0, column 3).\n\n- Row 3: filled with 3 (from row 3, column 5).\n\n- Row 7: filled with 1 (from row 7, column 1).\n\n- Row 9: filled with 1 (from row 9, column 8).\n\nColumns to be filled:\n\n- Column 4: filled with 2 (from row 5, column 4).\n\n- Column 9: filled with 2 (from row 1, column 9).\n\nNow, for each cell in the output:\n\nThe value is the maximum between:\n\n- The row fill if the row is filled.\n\n- The column fill if the column is filled.\n\nIf both, take the higher number.\n\nSo, let's construct the output:\n\nRow 0: filled with 3 \u2192 all cells in row 0 are 3.\n\nRow 1: not a filled row. Check columns. Column 9 is filled with 2. So row 1's cells:\n\n- All columns except 9 are 0, unless column 4 is filled (2). But in column 4, which is filled with 2. So:\n\nRow 1 has:\n\nColumns 4 \u2192 2, column 9 \u2192 2. Others are 0. But wait, columns 4 and 9 are filled. So row 1's output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nBut wait, row 1 is not filled, so only columns 4 and 9 are 2. But in the test input, row 1 has a 2 in column 9. So the column 9 is filled with 2. So for row 1:\n\nEach cell in columns 4 and 9 are 2, others 0.\n\nRow 2: not filled. Check columns 4 and 9. So columns 4 and 9 are 2, others 0.\n\nRow 3: filled with 3 \u2192 all cells 3.\n\nRow 4: not filled. Columns 4 and 9 \u2192 2. So row 4 would have 2s in columns 4 and 9.\n\nRow 5: not filled. Columns 4 and 9 \u2192 2. So row 5's column 4 is 2, and column 9 is 2.\n\nRow 6: not filled. Columns 4 and 9 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 7: filled with 1 \u2192 all cells 1.\n\nRow 8: not filled. Columns 4 and 9 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 9: filled with 1 \u2192 all cells 1.\n\nRow 10: not filled. Columns 4 and 9 \u2192 2.\n\nNow, we need to check for overlapping fills. For example, in row 0, column 3: row 0 is filled with 3 (even though the column 3 isn't filled here). So that's 3.\n\nBut wait, columns 4 and 9 are filled with 2. But row 0 is filled with 3, which is higher than 2. So all cells in row 0 are 3, overriding any column fills.\n\nSimilarly, row 3 is filled with 3. So all cells in row 3 are 3, even if columns 4 and 9 are 2.\n\nRow 7 and 9 are filled with 1, which is lower than 2 (from columns 4 and 9). So in these rows, the columns with 2 will override the row's 1.\n\nFor example, row 7: filled with 1, but column 4 is 2 and column 9 is 2. So in row 7, columns 4 and 9 will be 2, and the rest are 1.\n\nWait, no. The rule is that higher numbers take precedence. So for cell (7,4):\n\nRow 7 is filled with 1 (from the odd number 1), column 4 is filled with 2. Since 2 > 1, cell (7,4) is 2.\n\nSimilarly, cell (7,9) is 2.\n\nBut other cells in row 7 are 1.\n\nSo row 7's output would be:\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\nSimilarly, row 9 is filled with 1, but columns 4 and 9 are 2. So row 9's output is:\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\nPutting all together:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 3: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 7: [1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,1]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 9: [1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,1]\n\nRow 10: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nBut let's check for other possible column fills. Are there other non-zero numbers in the test input that I missed?\n\nTest input:\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 3 is odd \u2192 fill row 0 with 3.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0] \u2192 2 is even \u2192 fill column 9 with 2.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 3 is odd \u2192 fill row 3 with 3.\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 2 even \u2192 fill column 4 with 2.\n\nRow 7: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 1 odd \u2192 fill row 7 with 1.\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0] \u2192 1 is odd \u2192 fill row 9 with 1.\n\nAre there any other non-zero numbers? Let's check:\n\nRow 8: all zeros.\n\nRow 10: zeros.\n\nSo the only columns filled are column 4 (2) and column 9 (2). The rows filled are 0 (3), 3 (3), 7 (1), 9 (1).\n\nSo the output should be as constructed above.\n\nBut in the training examples, when a row is filled, it's filled entirely with the number, overriding any column fills unless the column fill is higher. For example, in example 2, row 3 is filled with 3 (from odd number 3), and column 3 is filled with 2 (from even number 2). So in row 3, column 3, the cell would be 3, since row fill is higher. But in the output of example 2, row 3 is all 3s. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the test input:\n\nRow 0 is filled with 3. All cells in row 0 are 3, regardless of column fills (columns 4 and 9 have 2, but 3 is higher).\n\nRow 7 is filled with 1. Columns 4 and 9 have 2, which is higher. So in those columns, cells are 2. Other columns are 1.\n\nRow 9 is filled with 1. Columns 4 and 9 are 2. So those columns have 2, others 1.\n\nNow, let's write the output for each row:\n\nRow 0: all 3s.\n\nRow 1: columns 4 and 9 are 2, others 0.\n\nRow 2: same as row 1.\n\nRow 3: all 3s.\n\nRow 4: columns 4 and 9 are 2.\n\nRow 5: columns 4 and 9 are 2.\n\nRow 6: columns 4 and 9 are 2.\n\nRow 7: columns 4 and 9 are 2, others 1.\n\nRow 8: columns 4 and 9 are 2.\n\nRow 9: columns 4 and 9 are 2, others 1.\n\nRow 10: columns 4 and 9 are 2.\n\nNow, applying this to each row:\n\nRow 0:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 1:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 2:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 3:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 4:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 5:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 6:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 7:\n\n[1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,1]\n\nRow 8:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 9:\n\n[1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,1]\n\nRow 10:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nThis should be the correct output.",
