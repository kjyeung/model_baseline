        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices in the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. Let me compare them. The input is a 10x10 grid of 0s and 1s, and the output has 0s, 1s, and 2s. So the transformation must be turning some 1s into 0s or 2s, or maybe adding 2s based on some condition.\n\nFirst, let's check where the 2s appear in the output. In the first example's output, the 2s are clustered in certain areas. For instance, the first row of the output is [0, 2, 0, ...]. Looking at the input's first row, it's [1,1,1,0,...]. So maybe the middle 1 turned into a 2. Similarly, the second row in output starts with 2,2,2. The input here is [1,0,1,0,...], so the output is all 2s. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, the output's second row is [2,2,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. So the first three elements are 2s. The input's second row has 1,0,1. So maybe the 0 in the middle is turned into a 2? Or perhaps it's considering neighboring cells.\n\nWait, maybe this is related to some kind of cellular automaton or neighbor counting. Like in Conway's Game of Life, but with different rules. Let's look for patterns in how the 2s are placed.\n\nAnother approach: compare each cell in input and output. Let's take a cell in input that was 1 and became 2. What's different about it? Let's take the first example's input row 1: [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. The output row is [2,2,2,0,...]. So the three cells (positions 0,1,2) in the input were 1,0,1, but in output they are all 2s. That's interesting. How did that happen?\n\nWait, maybe it's looking at horizontal or vertical sequences. For example, if there's a horizontal trio of 1s in the input, maybe they turn into 2s. But in example 0's first input row, the first three are 1s, but the output is 0,2,0. Hmm, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's checking for cross shapes. Like a cell and its four neighbors. Let's check some positions.\n\nTake the first example's input row 1 (second row in input) is [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. The output for that row is [2,2,2,0,...]. So the first three elements are 2s. The original input here is 1,0,1. If we consider their neighbors, maybe each of those cells has a certain number of neighbors. But how would that lead to 2s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 2s are placed where a cell and its immediate neighbors (in some pattern) meet a condition. Let's check another part. In example 0's input row 6: [0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]. The output is [0,1,0,0,2,0,0,...]. So the three 1s in the middle (positions 3,4,5) became 2s. Wait, in the output, position 4 is 2, and positions 3 and 5 are 0. So maybe the center of a horizontal trio of 1s becomes 2, and the others become 0? But in row 6 input, the trio is 1,1,1, and in output it's 0,2,0. Oh, that makes sense. So perhaps any horizontal trio of 1s (like three in a row) in the input gets transformed into 0s except the middle one, which becomes 2. Let's check other parts.\n\nIn example 0's input row 2: [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. The output is [0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. Wait, the first three 1s become 0,2,0. Then the next trio (positions 6,7,8) in input are 1,1,1, but the output there is 1,1,1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe there's more to it. Maybe vertical trios as well?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any horizontal trio of 1s where they are surrounded by 0s vertically? Not sure. Let's check example 1's input and output.\n\nIn example 1's input, the first row is [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0]. The output is [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. So the trio of 1s becomes 0,2,0. So similar to the previous case. Then the second row of input is [1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0], and the output is [1,1,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]. Wait, here the input's fifth element (index 4) is 1, but in the output, positions 4,5,6 are 2s. The input's positions 4,5,6 are 1,0,1. So how does that turn into 2,2,2? That's not a trio of 1s. Hmm, maybe another pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that form a cross. Like, a cell is 1, and has exactly two 1s in adjacent cells (like a cross shape). Alternatively, maybe the 2s are cells that are part of a 3x3 cross.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in cells that are the centers of cross-shaped regions. For example, a cell with 1s in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). But let's check.\n\nLooking at example 0's output row 1: [2,2,2,0,...]. The input here is [1,0,1,0,...]. Maybe each of those cells is part of a vertical trio? Like, in input row 1, the first column (row 0,1,2) might have 1,0,1. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any 1 that is part of a 3x3 square (like in a cross) becomes a 2. Let's take a specific example. For instance, in example 0's input row 6, the input is [0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]. The output is [0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. The 2 is in position 4 (5th element). So the input here has 1s at positions 3,4,5 (the trio). So in the output, only the middle becomes 2, others become 0. So perhaps any horizontal trio of 1s in the input is replaced by 0,2,0. Similarly, vertical trios might be replaced the same way.\n\nWait, let's check another example. In example 0's input row 7: [0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1]. The output is [0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,1,1]. So the trio here is positions 3,4,5: 1,0,1 in input. The output is 2,2,2. That's confusing. How does a 1,0,1 become 2,2,2? Unless there's a vertical component. Let's look at the cells around it. The row above (row6) in input is [0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]. So row7's position3 is 1. The row8 of input is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]. So row7's position3 (value1) has above it (row6, pos3) 1, and below (row8, pos3) 1. So vertical trio? If that's the case, then the middle element (row7, pos3) would be part of a vertical trio. So in that case, the cell becomes 2. Similarly, row7's pos5 is 1, but row6's pos5 is 1, row8's pos5 is 1. So vertical trio. Then perhaps any cell that is the middle of a vertical trio (three in a column) is turned into 2, and the others in the trio are turned into 0? But in row7's output, positions 3,4,5 are 2,2,2. So that's three 2s. Wait, maybe the rule is that if a cell is part of both a horizontal and vertical trio, it's 2. Or perhaps overlapping trios.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in cells where the cell and its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) have a certain configuration. For example, if a cell is 1 and has two 1s adjacent in a cross shape. Or maybe if a cell is part of a T-shape.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to find a rule that applies to the given examples.\n\nIn example 0's input row1, the first three elements are [1,0,1]. The output is [2,2,2]. How does that happen? The middle cell (0) becomes 2. Wait, maybe if the cell is 0 and has 1s on either side, it becomes 2. But that doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by counting the number of 1s in certain directions and changing to 2 if a condition is met.\n\nAnother approach: compare each cell in the input and output to see when a 1 becomes a 2, a 0 becomes a 2, etc.\n\nLet's take the first example's output row1 (second row):\n\nInput: [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nSo the first three cells (all 1,0,1) in input become 2,2,2. The 1 at position 7 remains 1. So why those three become 2s? Let's look at their neighbors.\n\nFor cell (1,0): input is 1. Neighbors: up is row0's (0,0) which is 1, down is row2's (0,0) which is 1. Left is out of bounds, right is (1,1)=0. So maybe vertical neighbors? The cell (1,0) has 1 above and 1 below. So vertical trio. So in that case, the middle cell (1,0) is part of a vertical trio. But the output here is 2. Similarly, cell (1,1) is 0 in input, but becomes 2. So that can't be explained by vertical trio. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: if a cell is a 1 and is part of a horizontal trio of 1s, then the middle becomes 2 and the others become 0. But if a cell is a 0 and is part of a vertical trio (with 1s above and below), then it becomes 2.\n\nWait, in example0's input row1, column0 is 1. The cell above (row0, column0) is 1, and below (row2, column0) is 1. So vertical trio. So in the input, row1, column0 is 1, and is part of a vertical trio. In the output, it becomes 2. Similarly, column2 in row1 is 1. Above is row0's column2=1, below row2's column2=1. So vertical trio. So output is 2. Then the cell in row1, column1 is 0. But above row0, column1 is 1, below row2, column1 is 1. So vertical trio with 0 in the middle. So maybe if a 0 is in the middle of a vertical trio of 1s, it becomes 2. That would explain why row1, column1 (0) becomes 2.\n\nSo the rule could be: For each cell, if it is part of a vertical trio (i.e., the cell above and below are 1, and current cell is 0 or 1?), then it becomes 2. Similarly, for horizontal trios. Or perhaps, if a cell is part of either a vertical or horizontal trio of 1s, then replace the trio with 2s.\n\nWait, but in example0's input row0, the first three are [1,1,1], which is a horizontal trio. The output is [0,2,0]. So the middle becomes 2, others 0. So maybe horizontal trios are replaced with 0,2,0. Vertical trios are replaced with 0,2,0 vertically. But how does that fit with other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: for every horizontal trio of 1s, replace them with 0,2,0. For every vertical trio of 1s, replace the middle cell with 2, and the others with 0. And if a cell is part of both a horizontal and vertical trio, it becomes 2.\n\nBut let's test this with example0's input row1. The cell (1,0) is part of a vertical trio (rows 0,1,2, column0). So according to this, the middle cell (row1) would become 2, and the others (row0 and row2) would become 0. But in the output, row0's column0 is 0, row1's is 2, and row2's column0 is 0. Which matches. Similarly, column0's output in row1 is 2. So that's correct.\n\nBut then in row1's column1 (input is 0), but in the output, it's 2. So why? Because the cell (1,1) is part of a vertical trio of 0 in the middle, but the above and below are 1. So if the rule is that a cell is part of a vertical trio (the current cell is 0, but above and below are 1s), then it becomes 2. But that's different from the horizontal trio rule.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- For horizontal sequences of three 1s, replace the middle with 2 and the others with 0.\n- For vertical sequences of three 1s, replace the middle with 2 and the others with 0.\n- Additionally, if a cell is 0 but is in the middle of a vertical trio (1 above and 1 below), it becomes 2.\n- Or perhaps, any cell that is part of any trio (horizontal or vertical) of 1s, becomes 2 if it's the middle, and 0 otherwise. But wait, in example0's input row7, the input is [0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1]. The output is [0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,1,1]. So the input's columns3,4,5 are 1,0,1. The output has 2s there. So how does this fit?\n\nIn row7's input, columns3,4,5 are 1,0,1. Let's check vertical trios. For column3 in row7: check rows 6,7,8. Row6's column3 is 1, row7's is 1, row8's is 1. So vertical trio. So middle cell (row7, column3) would be 2, and rows6 and 8's column3 become 0. But in the output, row7's column3 is 2, but row6's column3 in output is 0 (from example0's input row6 was [0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0], output row6 is [0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. So row6's column3 becomes 0. And row8's input column3 is 1 (row8's input is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0], and output row8 is [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. So column3 in row8 becomes 0. So the vertical trio in column3 (rows6,7,8) would have their middle (row7) as 2, others 0. That matches.\n\nSimilarly, row7's column5 is 1. Check rows6,7,8: row6's column5 is 1, row7's is1, row8's is1. So vertical trio. Middle (row7) becomes 2, others 0. But in output, row7's column5 is 2, and row6's column5 in output is 0 (from row6's output, which is [0,1,0,0,2,0,0,...], so column5 is 0), and row8's column5 becomes 0. So yes. But the output row7's columns3,4,5 are all 2s. So why column4 (original input is 0) becomes 2?\n\nIn row7's input column4 is 0. Let's check if it's part of a vertical trio. Check rows6,7,8 in column4. Row6's column4 is1, row7's is0, row8's is1. So vertical trio of 1,0,1. So not three in a row. So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a horizontal trio. Let's see: row7's columns3-5 are 1,0,1. So not a trio of 1s. So why in the output, columns3-5 are all 2s?\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed wherever there is a cross of three cells (like in a plus sign). For example, a cell is 1, and has 1s above and below, or left and right. So for example, if a cell has 1s to the left and right (horizontal trio), it becomes 2. Similarly, if it has 1s above and below (vertical trio), it becomes 2. But how does this apply to the examples.\n\nIn example0's row6, input is [0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]. The output is [0,1,0,0,2,0,0,...]. The middle of the horizontal trio (positions3-5) is 2. So the middle of the horizontal trio becomes 2, others 0. But in row7's columns3-5 (input 1,0,1), the output is 2,2,2. So maybe if a cell is part of both a vertical and horizontal trio, it becomes 2. For example, row7's column3 is part of a vertical trio (rows6,7,8) and part of a horizontal trio (columns3,4,5). But columns3-5's input is 1,0,1. So no horizontal trio. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in cells that are the centers of 3x3 crosses. For example, a cell and its four neighbors (up, down, left, right) are all 1s. But that would form a plus shape. Let's check.\n\nIn example0's output row1, column0 is 2. Input has row0, column0 as1, row1 as0, row2 as1. So not a cross. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: look at the positions where 2s are in the output and see what their input values and neighbors were.\n\nTake example0's output row1, columns0-2 are 2s. Input is [1,0,1]. So the cells at (1,0) is 1, (1,1) is 0, (1,2) is 1. Let's check their neighbors. For (1,0):\n\n- up: (0,0) is1\n- down: (2,0) is1\n- left: out of bounds\n- right: (1,1) is0\n\nSo it's part of a vertical trio. So perhaps vertical trio middle becomes 2. But (1,0) is the middle of rows0-2, column0. So yes. So the rule is: if a cell is the middle of a vertical trio (i.e., the cell above and below are 1s), then it becomes 2, regardless of its own value. Wait, (1,0) is 1, and becomes 2. (1,1) is 0, but above (0,1) is1 and below (2,1) is1, so vertical trio. So becomes 2. Similarly, (1,2) is 1, with above (0,2)=1 and below (2,2)=1, so becomes 2.\n\nAh! So the rule could be: for each cell, if the cell above and below are both 1s (vertical trio), then set the current cell to 2. Similarly, if the cell to the left and right are 1s (horizontal trio), set current cell to 2. And if both, maybe 2 as well. Then, in other cases, leave the cell as is (0 or 1).\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nIn example0's input row0: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nFor each cell in row0:\n\n- (0,0): up is out of bounds, so no. left and right are 1, so (0,0) has right cells (0,1) and (0,2) as1. So left is out of bounds. So only right has 1s. Wait, but (0,0) is part of a horizontal trio. So for cell (0,1), left (0,0) is1, right (0,2) is1. So horizontal trio, middle cell is (0,1). So according to this rule, cell (0,1) should be 2, and others in the trio 0. But in the output, row0 is [0,2,0,0,...]. So yes! That fits.\n\nSimilarly, in row1's input, cell (1,0) has above and below as1, so set to 2. Cell (1,1) has above (0,1)=1 and below (2,1)=1, so set to 2. Cell (1,2) has above and below as1, so set to 2. So the output is [2,2,2,...], which matches.\n\nAnother example: example0's row6, input is [0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]. For cell (6,4) which is1, check left and right. Left (6,3) is1, right (6,5) is1. So horizontal trio, middle cell (6,4) becomes 2. So output is 0,1,0,0,2,0,0,... which matches.\n\nIn row7's input, cell (7,3) is1. Check up (6,3)=1 and down (8,3)=1. So vertical trio, set to 2. Similarly, cell (7,5) is1. Up (6,5)=1 and down (8,5)=1. So vertical trio, set to 2. But cell (7,4) is0. Check up (6,4)=1 and down (8,4)=1. So vertical trio, so set to 2. So the output for row7 is [0,0,0,2,2,2,...], which matches.\n\nSo the rule seems to be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\n- If the cell has left and right cells as 1 (horizontal trio), then set to 2. But only the middle of the trio.\n\nWait, no. Because in the horizontal trio, it's the middle cell that gets set to 2. So for example, cells j-1, j, j+1. If all three are 1, then the middle j is set to 2, others to 0. But according to the previous examples, when a horizontal trio is present, only the middle becomes 2.\n\nWait, but in example0's row0, input is [1,1,1,0,...], output is [0,2,0,...]. So the three 1s are replaced with 0,2,0. So the middle becomes 2, others 0. Similarly, for vertical trios, the middle becomes 2.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\nFor any horizontal trio of 1s (three consecutive 1s in a row), replace the middle with 2 and the others with 0.\n\nFor any vertical trio of 1s (three consecutive 1s in a column), replace the middle with 2 and the others with 0.\n\nBut also, for cells that are 0 but are the middle of a vertical trio of 1s (like the cell has 1 above and below), then set to 2. But how does that fit with example0's row1, column1 which was 0 in input and 2 in output.\n\nSo, the rule is:\n\n- For every horizontal trio of 1s (three in a row), replace the middle with 2 and the others with 0.\n\n- For every vertical trio of 1s (three in a column), replace the middle with 2 and the others with 0.\n\n- Additionally, any cell that is 0 but has both left and right as 1, or both up and down as 1, becomes 2.\n\nBut how to handle overlapping trios?\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is:\n\nFor each cell, check if it is the center of a horizontal trio (i.e., the cell and its immediate left and right are 1). If yes, set it to 2, and set left and right to 0.\n\nSimilarly, check if it is the center of a vertical trio (cell and its immediate up and down are 1). If yes, set it to 2, and up and down to 0.\n\nBut this has to be applied in such a way that overlapping trios are handled. But since the examples show that trios are processed, perhaps the processing is done in a single pass, but with overlapping effects.\n\nBut how does this explain example0's row7, where the input has 1,0,1 in the horizontal direction, but the output is 2,2,2.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that if a cell is part of either a horizontal or vertical trio (i.e., either left and right are 1, or up and down are 1), then set it to 2, regardless of the original value. So:\n\nFor each cell, if (left and right are 1) OR (up and down are 1), then set to 2. Otherwise, leave as is, but with the caveat that overlapping trios might overwrite previous changes.\n\nBut let's test this.\n\nExample0's row1, column1: original value is 0. left (1,0) is1, right (1,2) is1. So left and right are 1. So set to 2. That's why it's 2 in output.\n\nRow7's column4: original 0. left (3) is1, right (5) is1. So set to 2. So output becomes 2. That's why row7's output columns3-5 are 2,2,2.\n\nAh, this makes sense. So the rule is: for each cell, if either the left and right are both 1 (horizontal neighbors) OR the up and down are both 1 (vertical neighbors), then set the cell to 2. All other cells remain as they were.\n\nBut wait, in example0's row0, the middle cell is 2. Because its left and right are 1. So that's correct.\n\nIn example0's row1, column0 is 1. It's up (row0) and down (row2) are 1. So set to 2.\n\nBut how about overlapping? For example, if a cell is part of both horizontal and vertical trios, it would be set to 2.\n\nLet's test example0's row6, input is [0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]. For cell (6,4) (value1), left and right are 1, so set to 2. So the output is 0,1,0,0,2,0,0,... which matches.\n\nIn example1's input row0: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0]. The middle cell (column5) has left and right as1. So set to 2. Output is [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0], which matches.\n\nAnother example from example1's input: row6 is [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Output is [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]. For cell (6,1), left is 0, right is 0. But up (row5, column1) is1, down (row7, column1) is1. So up and down are1. So cell (6,1) is set to2. Similarly for cell (6,3), up (row5,3) is1, down (row7,3) is1. So cell (6,3) is 1, but becomes 2. Wait, input row6's cell (6,3) is1. So in the output, it's 2. Because up and down are 1. So yes.\n\nSo the rule seems to be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j), if the left and right cells are 1 OR the up and down cells are 1, then set the cell to 2. Otherwise, leave it as the original input value.\n\nBut wait, in example0's row7's input, cell (7,4) is0, but left and right are 1 and 1 (cells3 and5 are 1). So according to the rule, cell4 would become 2. And that's what happens in the output.\n\nThis seems to fit all the examples.\n\nSo the transformation is: For each cell, if the left and right cells in the same row are both 1, OR the top and bottom cells in the same column are both 1, then set that cell to 2. Otherwise, keep the original value.\n\nYes, this explains all the examples. Now, to apply this to the test input.\n\nThe test input is a 10x10 grid. Let's process each cell to see if it meets the left/right or up/down conditions.\n\nLet's go row by row.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCheck each cell:\n\n- j=8 (value1). Left j=7 (0), right j=9 (0). So no. Check up and down (since row0 is the first row, down is row1, column8. Row1's j=8 is 1. Up is out of bounds, so can't have both up and down. So no. So stays 1.\n\nWait, no. According to the rule, for a cell to be 2, it must have both left and right as 1, or both up and down as 1.\n\nSo for row0, j=8 (value1):\n\nleft j7 is0, right j9 is0. So no.\n\nUp is row-1 (invalid), down is row1 j8. So only down. So not both up and down. So no. So output stays 1.\n\nBut let's check the output from example1's similar case. For example, in example1's input row3, column8 is 1. Output remains 1. So yes.\n\nNow, processing test input row0:\n\nAll cells in row0 are 0 except j8=1. None of the cells meet the left/right or up/down conditions. So output row0 is same as input except perhaps for j8. But j8 doesn't meet the conditions, so remains 1. But wait, in example0's row3, which is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0], the output is the same as input. So if a cell is 1 and doesn't meet the conditions, it stays 1.\n\nSo row0's output is same as input except for any cells that meet the conditions.\n\nBut let's check all cells in test input.\n\nRow0:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nFor each j from 0 to9:\n\nCheck left and right for each j:\n\nj=0: left invalid, right j1=0 \u2192 no.\n\nj=1: left j0=0, right j2=0 \u2192 no.\n\nj=2: left j1=0, right j3=0 \u2192 no.\n\n...\n\nj=8: left j7=0, right j9=0 \u2192 no.\n\nj=9: left j8=1, right invalid \u2192 no.\n\nCheck up and down:\n\nFor j=8, row0's j8. Up invalid, down row1's j8=1. So up and down not both 1. So no.\n\nSo row0's output remains same: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0].\n\nBut wait, in example1's input row3 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0], output is same. So yes.\n\nNow row1 of test input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1]\n\nFor each cell j:\n\nCheck left/right and up/down.\n\nLet's look for cells where left and right are both 1, or up and down are both 1.\n\nFor j=7: value1. left j6=0, right j8=1 \u2192 no.\n\nj=8: value1. left j7=1, right j9=1 \u2192 yes. So set to 2.\n\nj=9: value1. left j8=1, right invalid \u2192 no.\n\nFor j=8: check up and down. Up row0's j8=1, down row2's j8=0. So no. But left and right are both 1, so set to 2.\n\nSo row1's j8 becomes 2. So output row1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1].\n\nBut wait, the test input's row1 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1]. So j7=1, j8=1, j9=1.\n\nFor j=8: left j7=1, right j9=1 \u2192 yes. So j8 becomes 2. So row1's output is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1].\n\nBut what about j=7? Check left j6=0, right j8=1 \u2192 no. j9: left j8=1, right invalid \u2192 no.\n\nNow row2 of test input:\n\n[0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nCheck each j:\n\nj=1,2,3 are 1s. Let's check each cell.\n\nj=1: left j0=0, right j2=1 \u2192 no.\n\nj=2: left j1=1, right j3=1 \u2192 yes. So set to 2.\n\nj=3: left j2=1, right j4=0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo j=2 becomes 2. Check up and down for j=2.\n\nUp row1's j2=0, down row3's j2=1. So not both 1.\n\nSo j=2 becomes 2. So row2's j2 is 2. So output:\n\n[0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0].\n\nBut wait, what about other cells. For j=0: left invalid, right j1=1 \u2192 no.\n\nj=1: left j0=0, right j2=1 \u2192 no.\n\nj=3: left j2=1, right j4=0 \u2192 no.\n\nj=8: value1. left j7=0, right j9=0 \u2192 no. Check up/down: up row1's j8=2 (from row1's output), down row3's j8=0. So no. So remains 1.\n\nSo row2's output is [0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0].\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nRow3 of test input:\n\n[0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nCheck each j:\n\nj=1: value1. left j0=0, right j2=0 \u2192 no. Check up/down: up row2's j1=1, down row4's j1=1. So up and down are 1. So set to 2.\n\nj=3: value1. left j2=0 (row3's j2 is0?), wait, row3's input is [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So j=3 is 1. left j2=0, right j4=0 \u2192 no. Check up/down: up row2's j3=1 (from input row2's j3=1), down row4's j3=0. So no. So j3 remains 1.\n\nSo for row3, j=1 is set to 2 because up and down are 1. So output row3: [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow4 of test input:\n\n[0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nCheck each cell:\n\nj=1,2,3 are 1s.\n\nj=1: left j0=0, right j2=1 \u2192 no. Check up/down: up row3's j1=2 (from previous step), down row5's j1=0. So no.\n\nj=2: left j1=1, right j3=1 \u2192 yes. So set to 2.\n\nj=3: left j2=1, right j4=0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo row4's output j2 becomes 2. So row4: [0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow5: all zeros. No changes.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nCheck cells j6 and j7 are 1s.\n\nj6: left j5=0, right j7=1 \u2192 no.\n\nj7: left j6=1, right j8=0 \u2192 no.\n\nCheck up/down for j6 and j7:\n\nj6: up row5's j6=0, down row7's j6=0. So no.\n\nj7: up row5's j7=0, down row7's j7=1. So no.\n\nSo row6 remains same.\n\nRow7: [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nCheck j1, j2, j3 are 1s.\n\nj1: left j0=0, right j2=1 \u2192 no.\n\nj2: left j1=1, right j3=1 \u2192 yes. Set to 2.\n\nj3: left j2=1, right j4=0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo row7's j2 becomes 2. So output row7: [0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow8: [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1]\n\nCheck each cell:\n\nj=1: value1. left j0=0, right j2=0 \u2192 no. Check up/down: up row7's j1=1 (from row7's output), down row9's j1=1. So yes. Set to 2.\n\nj=3: value1. left j2=0, right j4=0 \u2192 no. Check up/down: up row7's j3=1 (row7's input is [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0], output row7's j3 is1. So up row7's j3 is1, down row9's j3=1 (row9's input is [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1], j3=1). So up and down are 1. So j3 becomes 2.\n\nj=8 and j9: both 1.\n\nj8: left j7=0, right j9=1 \u2192 no. Check up/down: up row7's j8=0, down row9's j8=1. No.\n\nj9: left j8=1, right invalid \u2192 no. Check up/down: up row7's j9=0, down row9's j9 is out of bounds. So no.\n\nSo row8's output: j1 becomes 2, j3 becomes 2. So [0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1].\n\nRow9: [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1]\n\nCheck each cell:\n\nj=1,2,3: 1s.\n\nj1: left j0=0, right j2=1 \u2192 no. Check up/down: up row8's j1=2, down row10 (invalid). So no.\n\nj2: left j1=1, right j3=1 \u2192 yes. Set to 2.\n\nj3: left j2=1, right j4=0 \u2192 no.\n\nj8 and j9: 1s.\n\nj8: left j7=0, right j9=1 \u2192 no. Check up/down: up row8's j8=1, down invalid. No.\n\nj9: left j8=1, right invalid \u2192 no. So no changes except j2 becomes 2.\n\nSo row9's output: [0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1].\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTest Output:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1]\nRow2: [0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0]\nRow3: [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow4: [0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0]\nRow7: [0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow8: [0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1]\nRow9: [0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1]\n\nBut wait, in example1's output, there are cases where multiple 2s are generated from vertical checks. For instance, in example1's row6: input is [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0], output is [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]. This is because in row6, j=1,3:\n\nFor j=1: up row5's j1=1, down row7's j1=1 \u2192 so set to 2.\n\nj=3: up row5's j3=1, down row7's j3=1 \u2192 set to 2.\n\nBut in the test input's row8, j=1 and j3 have up/down as 1, so set to 2.\n\nBut in the test input's row3, j=1 is set to 2 because up and down are 1.\n\nSo the output seems correct.\n\nBut let's cross-verify. For example, in test input's row8:\n\nInput row8 is [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1].\n\nProcessing j=1: check up (row7's j1 is1, row7's output is [0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0], so j1 is1. down row9's j1 is1. So up and down are1. So j1 becomes 2.\n\nj=3: up row7's j3 is1 (from row7's input j3 is1), down row9's j3 is1. So set to 2.\n\nThus, row8's output j1 and j3 are 2.\n\nSo the final output should be as constructed.\n\nBut I need to make sure that overlapping processing doesn't cause issues. For example, when a cell is part of both left/right and up/down conditions, it's set to 2 regardless.\n\nYes, in the test input's row2, j=2 is set to 2 due to left/right.\n\nIn row3's j=1 is set to 2 due to up/down.\n\nSo the final answer should match the format of the training examples.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples. Let's start by looking at Example 0. The input is a 10x10 grid of 0s and 1s, and the output has some 2s added. Let's compare them cell by cell to see where the 2s are.\n\nLooking at the first input row of Example 0: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output row is [0,2,0,0,...]. So the 1s in the input turned into 0s and 2s. Hmm. Maybe it's something to do with neighboring cells? Let's check the surrounding cells for where the 2s are.\n\nIn the output, the middle 1 in the first row becomes a 2. If I imagine a 3x3 grid around that position, maybe if a cell has exactly three 1s in its neighborhood, it becomes a 2? Wait, but the original cell is a 1. Let's check another example.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first output row has a 2 in the sixth position. The input row is [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0], and the output is [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,...]. So the middle 1 here becomes a 2. Again, perhaps the middle of three consecutive 1s becomes a 2? But wait, maybe it's more about the surrounding cells in all directions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing certain 1s based on their neighbors. Like, if a 1 has exactly two or three neighbors, it stays 1, otherwise becomes 0. But that's the game of life rules, but in the outputs, there are 2s instead. Wait, the outputs have 2s where maybe some transformation occurs. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nOriginal input row 0: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput row 0: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nSo the three 1s turn into 0,2,0. Similarly, in row 2 of input Example 0: [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0] becomes [0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. The first three 1s become 0,2,0, and the next three 1s (positions 6,7,8) become 1,1,1. Hmm, maybe there's a direction involved. Like, horizontal sequences?\n\nWait, maybe when three 1s are in a horizontal line, the middle one becomes a 2. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input row 0: [1,1,1] becomes [0,2,0]. So the middle 1 becomes 2, the others become 0. Similarly, input row 6 of Example 0 is [0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0], and the output row 6 is [0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. Here, the three 1s in positions 3-5 (1-based?) become 0,2,0. So that fits. So the pattern is: if three consecutive 1s are in a row (horizontal), the middle one becomes 2 and the others become 0. But wait, in the output row 1 of Example 0, the input is [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0], output is [2,2,2,0,...]. Wait, that input has 1,0,1. How does that become 2,2,2? That doesn't fit the previous pattern. Maybe vertical sequences?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's looking for 3x3 blocks where the center is 1 and has exactly three 1s around it. But I'm getting confused. Let's look at another part.\n\nIn Example 1's output row 6: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The input row 6 is [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, that doesn't have three consecutive 1s. Hmm. So maybe the pattern isn't just horizontal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is similar to the Game of Life, but with 2s indicating something. Let's think about the Game of Life rules: a cell survives if it has 2 or 3 neighbors, else dies. A new cell is born if exactly 3 neighbors. But in these examples, cells are turning into 2s. Maybe the 2s are cells that were 1s and survived, and 0s are deaths. But then, why 2s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 2s represent cells that were 1s and have exactly two or three neighbors, and 0s are those that die. But in the output, some cells are 1s. Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's input row 1: [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. Output is [2,2,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. The first three elements in input are 1,0,1. How does that become 2,2,2? That doesn't fit a survival rule. So maybe not Game of Life.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, maybe each 1 in the input is transformed into a 2 if it's part of a certain structure. For instance, cross shapes. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 7: [0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1]. Output row 7 becomes [0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,1,1]. The input here has 1s at positions 3,5,8,9. The output has 2s at 3,4,5. So the three consecutive 1s (maybe in vertical?), but they were 1,0,1 in the input. Wait, that's not consecutive. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that when a 1 is part of a vertical or horizontal line of three, the middle one becomes a 2. But in Example 0, input row 0 has three horizontal 1s, middle becomes 2. Input row 7 (original input) has 1s at positions 3,5,8,9. But in output row 7, positions 3-5 are 2s. So maybe in the input, there's a vertical arrangement. Let me check the surrounding rows.\n\nIn input row 7: [0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1]. Let's look at the rows above and below. Row 6 is [0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]. Row 7 is [0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1]. Row 8 is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]. So in column 3 (0-based?), row 6 has 1, row 7 has 1, row 8 has 1. So vertically three 1s. The middle one (row7, column3) becomes 2. Similarly, column5: row6 has 1, row7 has1, row8 has1. Middle becomes 2. So in output row7, columns3-5 are 2s. That makes sense. So vertical triple 1s turn the middle into 2. Similarly, horizontal triple 1s turn middle into 2.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each cell, if it is part of a horizontal trio (three consecutive 1s in a row) or a vertical trio (three consecutive 1s in a column), then the middle one becomes 2, and the others become 0. But how do the other cells behave?\n\nWait, let's check another part. In Example 0's input row 1: [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. The output is [2,2,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. The first three cells (1,0,1) become 2,2,2. But that's not a trio. Unless it's vertical. Let's check the rows above and below.\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,...]\nRow1: [1,0,1,...]\nRow2: [1,1,1,...]\nSo for column0, rows0-2 are 1,1,1. So vertical trio. So middle (row1, column0) becomes 2. Similarly, column2, rows0-2 are 1,1,1. Middle becomes 2. But in the output row1, columns0-2 are 2,2,2. That's all three cells. But according to the vertical trio, only the middle row (row1) would have the middle cell (column0, column1, column2?) Wait, perhaps each cell is checked for being the middle of a vertical or horizontal trio.\n\nWait, maybe for each cell, if it is part of both a horizontal and vertical trio, it becomes 2. Let's see:\n\nTake the cell in row0, column1 of Example0's input. It's part of a horizontal trio (columns0-2). So middle becomes 2. Also, looking vertically, rows0-2 in column1: 1,0,1. That's not a vertical trio. So only horizontal. So it becomes 2. In the output, that's correct.\n\nNow, the cell in row1, column0. Vertically, rows0-2 have 1,1,1. So vertical trio. Middle is row1, column0. So becomes 2. Also, horizontally, row1, columns0-2: 1,0,1. Not a trio. So vertical makes it 2. So in output row1, column0 is 2. Correct.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: a cell is 2 if it is the middle of a horizontal trio (three consecutive 1s in row) OR the middle of a vertical trio (three consecutive 1s in column). Otherwise, if it was a 1 but not in such a position, it becomes 0. Otherwise, remains 0. Wait, but in the output, some 1s remain. For example, in Example0's output row2, columns6-8 are [1,1,1]. Let's check the input row2: [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. So those three 1s. Are they part of a trio? Let's see: columns6-8, row2: 1,1,1. So horizontally, they form a trio. So according to the rule, the middle (column7) should be 2. But in the output, they remain 1,1,1. Wait, that contradicts. Hmm.\n\nSo maybe my initial hypothesis is wrong. Let me re-examine that.\n\nIn Example0's output row2: [0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. The input row2 has [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. The first three 1s become 0,2,0 (as expected), but the last three 1s (positions6-8) remain 1,1,1. Why?\n\nLooking at the surrounding rows. For the last three 1s in row2 (positions6-8), let's check vertically. For column6: row2 has 1. What about rows1 and 3? Row1, column6 is 0. Row3, column6 is 0. So no vertical trio. So horizontal trio exists (three in a row), so the middle should be 2. But in output, they are all 1s. So my hypothesis must be wrong.\n\nHmm. So there's something else. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 2s are replacing 1s that are part of a cross. A cross would be a central 1 with exactly four 1s in the cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), but that seems not directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a diamond pattern. Or maybe the 2s are indicating cells that are the intersection of vertical and horizontal triple 1s.\n\nWait, in Example0's input row1, column0: 1. The cells above and below (row0 and row2) are also 1. So vertical trio. So the middle becomes 2. Similarly, column2 in row0-2 is 1,0,1. Wait, that's not a vertical trio. Wait no, in row0 column0 is 1, row1 column0 is 1, row2 column0 is 1. So vertical trio. So row1, column0 becomes 2. But in the output, row1's column0 is 2. Correct.\n\nIn row0, column1: part of horizontal trio. So middle becomes 2. Correct.\n\nBut then in row2's columns6-8, which are 1,1,1 in input. They form a horizontal trio. Why aren't they transformed? Let's see what's around them. Let's check the rows above and below for vertical trios.\n\nFor row2, column6: 1. The rows1 and3, column6 are 0 and 0. So no vertical trio. So according to the earlier rule, the horizontal trio's middle (column7) should be 2. But in output row2, column7 is 1. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is applied only to 1s that are in a horizontal trio but not part of a vertical trio. Or perhaps there's another condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the 2s are created when a horizontal trio is followed by a vertical trio, or vice versa. Alternatively, maybe the transformation applies to 1s that are part of both horizontal and vertical trios.\n\nWait, let's take Example0's row0, column1: part of horizontal trio, but vertically, rows0,1,2 in column1 are 1,0,1. Not a vertical trio. So only horizontal. So becomes 2. Correct.\n\nNow, row2, columns6-8: horizontal trio. But vertically, column7 in rows1,2,3: row1 column7 is 1, row2 column7 is 1, row3 column7 is 0. So not a vertical trio. So according to the rule, the middle of the horizontal trio (column7) should be 2. But in output, it's 1. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. So maybe the rule isn't just horizontal or vertical trios. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at the outputs, another observation: the 2s often form a plus sign or a cross. For example, in Example0's output row7: [0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,1,1]. The 2s are in positions3-5. Let's check the input for row7. Input row7 is [0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1]. So columns3 and5 are 1, but 4 is 0. So how does this become three 2s? Wait, that's confusing. Maybe looking at surrounding rows.\n\nRow6: [0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]\nRow7: [0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1]\nRow8: [0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo columns3 in rows6-8: 1,1,1. That's a vertical trio. So middle (row7, column3) becomes 2. Similarly, column5 in rows6-8: 1,1,1. Middle (row7, column5) becomes 2. And column4 in rows6-8: 1,0,1. So not a vertical trio. But in output row7, columns3-5 are 2s. So maybe the vertical trios in columns3 and5 cause their middle to be 2, and the horizontal trio in row7's columns3-5? But there's no horizontal trio there in the input. Wait, input row7 has columns3 and5 as 1, but column4 as 0. So that's not a horizontal trio. So why are there three 2s in a row?\n\nThis is confusing. Let me think of another approach. Let's look for the differences between input and output cells where the output is 2.\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nLooking for cells that became 2 in the output.\n\nRow0, column1: input 1 \u2192 output 2. Check neighbors:\n\nRow0: columns0-2 are 1,1,1. So horizontal trio. So middle becomes 2.\n\nRow1, column0: input 1. Check vertical trio (rows0,1,2, column0: 1,1,1). Middle becomes 2.\n\nRow1, column1: input 0. How did it become 2? Wait, output row1 is [2,2,2,0,...]. So input row1: [1,0,1,...]. So input 0 becomes 2. That's unexpected. Wait, original input row1 is [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. Output row1 is [2,2,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. So the three first elements (1,0,1) become 2,2,2. That's strange because the middle was 0. How does a 0 turn into 2?\n\nAh, this changes things. So maybe the rule isn't about existing 1s. Maybe it's creating 2s based on neighboring conditions, even if the cell itself was 0.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Maybe 2s are born when certain conditions are met, regardless of the original cell's value.\n\nIn row1, column1: input 0 becomes 2. So maybe a cell becomes 2 if it has exactly three 1s in its neighborhood (like Game of Life's birth rule). Let's check:\n\nRow1, column1's neighbors:\n\nAbove: row0, column1 (1)\nBelow: row2, column1 (1)\nLeft: row1, column0 (1)\nRight: row1, column2 (1)\nDiagonals: row0,0 (1); row0,2 (1); row2,0 (1); row2,2 (1). Wait, total neighbors. Let's count.\n\nRow0, column0: 1 (top-left)\nRow0, column1: 1 (up)\nRow0, column2: 1 (top-right)\nRow1, column0:1 (left)\nRow1, column2:1 (right)\nRow2, column0:1 (bottom-left)\nRow2, column1:1 (down)\nRow2, column2:1 (bottom-right)\n\nTotal of 8 neighbors. Wait, but that's impossible in a 10x10 grid. For edge cells, some neighbors are out of bounds. Wait, but in this case, row1, column1 is in the middle, so all eight neighbors exist.\n\nWait, input row0: [1,1,1,...]\nRow1: [1,0,1,...]\nRow2: [1,1,1,...]\n\nSo for cell (row1, column1), the neighbors are:\n\nup: row0, column1 (1)\ndown: row2, column1 (1)\nleft: row1, column0 (1)\nright: row1, column2 (1)\ndiagonal up-left: row0, column0 (1)\nup-right: row0, column2 (1)\ndown-left: row2, column0 (1)\ndown-right: row2, column2 (1)\n\nSo all eight neighbors are 1s. But in the input cell (row1, column1) is 0. So in the output, it becomes 2. But according to Game of Life rules, a cell is born (from dead) if exactly three live neighbors. But here, eight live neighbors. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is different. Let's check another example where a 0 becomes 2.\n\nIn Example1's input row6: [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Output is [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So cells 1,2,3 become 2. The input was 0,1,0,1. Let's check cell1 (row6, column1) which was 1. Its neighbors:\n\nUp: row5, column1: 1\nDown: row7, column1:1\nLeft: row6, column0:0\nRight: row6, column2:0\nDiagonals: row5,0:0; row5,2:1; row7,0:0; row7,2:1.\n\nSo neighbors are up (1), down (1), right (0), etc. So total live neighbors: up (1), down (1), row5, column2 (1), row7, column2 (1). Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that a cell (whether 0 or 1) becomes 2 if the number of 1s in the surrounding eight cells is exactly 3. Let's check:\n\nRow1, column1 (Example0's input) has eight 1s around it. So count is 8. That's way more than 3, but output is 2. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of 1s in the row. For example, if there's three consecutive 1s in a row, replace the middle with 2. But earlier examples contradict this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed where a 1 is part of both a horizontal and vertical trio. But how?\n\nIn Example0's input row1, column0: part of a vertical trio (rows0-2). So becomes 2. But in the output, it's 2. That's one condition.\n\nIn row0, column1: part of horizontal trio, becomes 2. So maybe the rule is that a cell becomes 2 if it's the middle of a horizontal trio OR a vertical trio. But then, in row1, column1 (input 0) becomes 2. How? Because row1, column0,1,2 in input are 1,0,1. So no horizontal trio. But vertically, columns0, rows0-2 are 1,1,1. So column0 has vertical trio. So row1, column0 becomes 2. Similarly, column2 has rows0-2 as 1,1,1. So row1, column2 becomes 2. So why is row1, column1 also 2 in output?\n\nWait, row1, column1 in output is 2, but in input it was 0. So perhaps the rule is that if a cell is surrounded by vertical and horizontal trios, even if it's 0, it becomes 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are formed when there's a 3x3 cross (plus shape) of 1s. For example, a cell and its four cardinal neighbors are all 1s. But that's five cells. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's input row1, column0: it's 1. Its neighbors up (row0,0) is 1, down (row2,0) is 1. Left and right would be row1,-1 (out of bounds) and row1,1 (0). So only up and down are 1s. That's two. Not a cross. But it becomes 2.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try to think of another approach. Perhaps the output is the result of two passes: first, replace all horizontal trios' middle with 2, then vertical trios' middle with 2, but overlapping?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace all horizontal and vertical trios of 1s into a cross of 2s. For example, any three in a row or column become 2s in the middle. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0's row0, the horizontal trio becomes 0,2,0. But in row1's output, the three 2s in the first three columns. But the input was 1,0,1. So how does that become 2,2,2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for any cell that is adjacent to two or more 1s in a line (horizontal or vertical), it becomes a 2. But not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: a cell becomes 2 if it is between two 1s in a row or column, regardless of its own state. For example:\n\nIn row0, column1: between two 1s (columns0 and 2) \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nIn row1, column0: between two 1s in the column (rows0 and 2) \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nIn row1, column2: between two 1s in the column (rows0 and 2) \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nBut row1, column1: between 1s in columns0 and 2, and rows0 and 2. So maybe that's why it becomes 2 even though it was 0.\n\nSo the rule could be: any cell that is between two 1s horizontally (left and right are 1) OR vertically (above and below are 1), then set to 2. Otherwise, if it was a 1 and not between two 1s in any direction, set to 0. Otherwise, remains 0.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example0's input row0, column1: left and right are 1, so becomes 2.\n\nRow1, column0: above and below are 1, becomes 2.\n\nRow1, column1: left (column0) is 1, right (column2) is 1, so becomes 2. Also, above and below are 0 and 1. But since it's between two horizontally, it becomes 2. Even though its own value was 0.\n\nRow1, column7: input 1. Let's see: left and right are 0 and 0 (columns6 and8), above and below are 0 and 0 (rows0 and2). So no, it's not between two 1s. So becomes 0. But output row1, column7 is 1. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nIn Example0's input row1, column7 is 1. Output is 1. According to the hypothesis, since it's not between two 1s in any direction, it should be set to 0. But the output remains 1. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. So maybe the rule is more complex. Let's think of another example. In Example0's output row6: [0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. Input row6 is [0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]. The three 1s in columns3-5 (input) become 0,2,0. So middle becomes 2. So it's like horizontal trio replaced with 0,2,0. But according to the previous hypothesis, column4 is between two 1s horizontally. So becomes 2. Columns3 and5 are edges, so become 0. That fits. So maybe for horizontal trios, the middle becomes 2, others become 0. For vertical trios, the middle becomes 2, others become 0. But then how to handle cells that are part of both?\n\nIn row1's columns0-2, input is 1,0,1. So not a horizontal trio, but each cell is part of vertical trios. So columns0 has vertical trio, so row1,0 becomes 2. Column2 has vertical trio, so row1,2 becomes 2. Column1 is between two 1s horizontally (0 and 2) \u2192 becomes 2. But input is 0. So maybe if a cell is between two 1s in either direction, set to 2, regardless of its own value. And if a cell is a 1 but not between two 1s, set to 0. So that's the rule.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nFor any cell:\n\nIf in the same row, the left and right cells are 1 \u2192 set to 2.\n\nIf in the same column, the above and below cells are 1 \u2192 set to 2.\n\nOtherwise, if the cell was 1 \u2192 set to 0.\n\nIf the cell was 0 and not between two 1s in any direction \u2192 remains 0.\n\nSo this would explain the examples.\n\nLet's check Example0's input row0, column1: left and right are 1 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nRow1, column0: above and below are 1 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nRow1, column1: left and right are 1 \u2192 becomes 2 (even though it was 0).\n\nRow1, column2: above and below are 1 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nRow7, column3: above and below are 1 (rows6 and8) \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nRow7, column4: above and below are 1 (rows6 and8, columns4) \u2192 yes. So row7, column4 becomes 2.\n\nRow7, column5: same as column3 and4 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nBut in row7's input, column4 is 0. But according to the rule, if a cell's left and right are 1, or above and below are 1, it becomes 2. So even if the cell itself is 0.\n\nNow, let's check Example0's row2, columns6-8. Input is 1,1,1. So for column7, left and right are 1 \u2192 becomes 2. But in output, it's 1. So this contradicts. What's the issue here?\n\nRow2, column6: left is 0 (column5), right is column7 (1). So not between two 1s. So if cell is 1, and not between two 1s \u2192 becomes 0. But in output, it's 1. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the rule is not as simple as that.\n\nWait, let's look at Example0's output row2: [0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. The input row2 has 1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0. The first three 1s become 0,2,0. The last three 1s remain 1,1,1. Why?\n\nLooking at the last three 1s (columns6-8):\n\nFor column7 (middle of the last trio), left and right are 1s \u2192 should become 2. But in output, it's 1. So why?\n\nPossibly, the rule applies only to the first occurrence, or there's another condition. Let's check the surrounding columns.\n\nIn row2, column6: 1. Left is column5 (0), right is column7 (1). So not between two 1s. So according to the rule, if the cell is 1 and not between two 1s, it becomes 0. But output is 1.\n\nSo this contradicts the hypothesis. So the rule must be something else.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is the input with all horizontal and vertical triple 1s replaced with 2 in the middle, and other 1s replaced with 0. But some 1s remain. So perhaps the 1s that are part of a larger structure (like a 3x3 square) remain.\n\nBut in Example0's row2, columns6-8 are three 1s. Output is 1,1,1. So why aren't they replaced? Maybe because they're part of a vertical trio as well. Let's check columns6-8 in the vertical direction.\n\nFor column6: rows2 has 1, row1 has 0, row3 has 0. So no vertical trio.\n\nColumn7: rows2 has 1, row1 has 1, row3 has 0. So no vertical trio (rows1,2,3: 1,1,0 \u2192 not three).\n\nColumn8: rows2 has 1, row1 has 0, row3 has 0. So no vertical trio.\n\nSo why aren't the horizontal trio's middle replaced with 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is applied only to the first horizontal or vertical trio encountered. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is only applied to certain regions. For example, 2s are placed where a cell is part of both a horizontal and vertical trio. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0's row0, column1: horizontal trio, but not vertical. So no. But becomes 2. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 1 that is not part of a horizontal or vertical trio is turned to 0. If it's part of a horizontal or vertical trio, the middle becomes 2, and the others become 0. But how to explain the remaining 1s.\n\nIn Example0's output row2, columns6-8 are 1,1,1. So they are not part of any trio, hence remain 1? But they are part of a horizontal trio. So according to the rule, the middle should be 2. But it's not. So this is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the answer lies in the fact that the output is generated by applying a single pass where each cell is checked for horizontal or vertical trios. If a cell is the middle of a horizontal trio, it becomes 2. If it's the middle of a vertical trio, it becomes 2. Otherwise, if it's a 1, it becomes 0. But this doesn't explain why some 1s remain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s that are part of a 3x3 block survive. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's row2, columns6-8 are 1s. Are they part of a 3x3 block of 1s? Let's look at surrounding rows and columns.\n\nRow2: columns6-8 are 1s.\nRow3: columns6-8 are 0,1,0.\nRow4: columns6-8 are 0,0,0.\nSo no, not a 3x3 block.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of two separate transformations: horizontal and vertical. For example, first replace horizontal trios, then vertical trios. But how.\n\nIn Example0's input row1, column0: after vertical trio processing, becomes 2. In row1, column0 is part of a vertical trio, so becomes 2. Similarly, column2 becomes 2. Then, during horizontal processing, row1, columns0-2 have 2,0,2. No horizontal trio, so no changes. So the output for row1 would be 2,0,2. But in the example output, it's 2,2,2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the 2s represent cells that are part of a T-shape. For example, a horizontal trio with a vertical trio in the middle. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let's try to see if there's another pattern. Let's look at the difference between input and output for each example.\n\nIn Example0's input, the output has 2s where there were 1s in certain positions. For instance, the middle of horizontal or vertical trios. But the remaining 1s in the output must have some other condition.\n\nLooking at Example0's output row5: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The input row5 is the same. So the three 1s are left as 1s. Why aren't they turned into 0,2,0? Because in the input, row5 is [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and output is same as input. So that's conflicting. Unless there's a different condition here.\n\nWait, looking at the input row5: is there something different about these 1s? Let's check the rows above and below.\n\nRow4: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow5: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow6: [0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo for the 1s in row5, columns0-2: vertically, row4 has 0,1,0. row5 has 1,1,1. row6 has 0,1,0. So in column0: rows4-6: 0,1,0. So no vertical trio. So according to the previous hypothesis, the horizontal trio's middle (column1) should become 2. But output row5 is same as input. So the three 1s remain. Why?\n\nAh, maybe the transformation is applied only to certain rows or regions. Or perhaps the rule is that the transformation is applied to cells that are part of horizontal or vertical trios but not part of a 3x3 block.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that a cell becomes 2 if it is part of a horizontal trio and there's no vertical trio overlapping. Or vice versa.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Let's try to think of the test input and see if applying a certain rule produces the expected output.\n\nThe test input is similar to Example1's input. Let's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nExpected Output: ?\n\nAssuming the pattern is replacing the middle of horizontal or vertical trios with 2 and others to 0, let's apply this rule.\n\nFor example, in row2 of test input: [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0]. The horizontal trio in columns1-3. Middle (column2) becomes 2. So output row2 would be [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0].\n\nBut looking at Example1's similar input row2: input [1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0] becomes output [1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. So the horizontal trio in columns4-6 becomes 0,2,0.\n\nSo following that, in test input row2, the horizontal trio columns1-3 should become 0,2,0. So output row2: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0].\n\nBut let's check for vertical trios as well. For example, test input row1, columns7-9: [1,1,1]. So horizontal trio. Middle (column8) becomes 2. So output row1 would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0].\n\nBut in Example1's input row0, which has three 1s horizontally, the output is [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0], which suggests the middle becomes 2 and others 0.\n\nBut this is getting time-consuming. Based on the training examples, it seems that whenever there's a horizontal or vertical trio of 1s, the middle becomes a 2, and the others become 0. However, in some cases, 1s remain, which might be due to them being part of a different structure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the rule is: for any horizontal or vertical trio of 1s, replace the middle with 2 and the others with 0. Then, for overlapping cases, prioritize one direction.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFor example, row2: [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0] \u2192 after replacing horizontal trio, becomes [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0].\n\nRow7: [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 becomes [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow8: [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1]. The vertical trio might be in columns8-9. But no, column8 has 1 in rows8 and9, but not three. Looking for vertical trios: for example, row7, columns1-3: 1,1,1. So vertical trio in columns1, rows7-9? Let's check:\n\nRow7, column1:1\nRow8, column1:1\nRow9, column1:1 \u2192 vertical trio. So middle (row8, column1) becomes 2. So row8's column1 would be 2.\n\nSimilarly, row9, columns1-3: 1,1,1. Horizontal trio \u2192 middle becomes 2. So row9's column2 becomes 2, others 0.\n\nBut this is a guess. Given the time, I'll proceed to apply this rule to the test input and generate the output accordingly.",
