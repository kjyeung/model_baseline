        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input arrays and their corresponding outputs. The challenge is to see how the inputs are transformed into the outputs. Let me look at the training examples first.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a list of several arrays. The output is a shorter list of arrays. Looking at the input arrays, I notice that some of them have numbers that are different from the majority. For instance, the first input array is [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,3]. The output starts with [2,4,1,4,2]. Hmm. Maybe the output is capturing certain elements from the input arrays? Let's check the positions.\n\nWait, maybe the output arrays are formed by taking the middle elements of certain rows? Like, the output arrays in Example 0 are of length 5. If the input rows are of length 11, the middle element would be position 5 (0-based index 5). But looking at the first input row in Example 0: the middle elements would be positions around 5. Let's see: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,3] \u2013 the middle is the 6th element (index 5), which is 3. But the first output array is [2,4,1,4,2]. That doesn't match. So maybe that's not the approach.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps each output array corresponds to a specific position in the input rows. Let's look at how the output arrays are formed. In Example 0's output, the first output is [2,4,1,4,2]. Let's see which input rows have these numbers. Let's check each input row in Example 0's input. The first input row has 4s at positions 7 and 9. The output's first element is 2. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a kind of diamond or cross pattern. For example, taking elements from different rows in a symmetrical way. Let's look at the output arrays and see their lengths. In Example 0, the output has 5 arrays, each of length 5. Maybe each output array is formed by combining elements from multiple input rows in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the non-3 elements (since the majority in the input are 3s) and arranging them in a certain way. For example, in Example 0, the first input row has 4s. The output's first array has 2,4,1,4,2. Wait, maybe it's the unique elements arranged in a palindromic way. Like, the first output array is symmetric: 2,4,1,4,2. The second output array in Example 0 is [8,3,3,3,8], which is symmetric as well. So symmetry seems to be a key here.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input has a lot of 1s. The output arrays are [8,3,8], [3,1,3], [8,3,8]. These are symmetric. The middle element of the middle output array is 1, which is the same as the majority in the input. The 8 and 3 might be the non-1 elements arranged symmetrically.\n\nExample 2's output includes [1,4,7,4,1], [4,4,4,4,4], [7,4,4,4,7], etc. Again, symmetry is evident. The first and last elements are the same, and the middle is varying. So maybe the pattern is to find the unique elements in the input rows and arrange them symmetrically around a center, perhaps in the order they appear.\n\nAnother observation: the output arrays have lengths that are odd numbers (5, 3, 5 in the examples). Maybe the length corresponds to the number of unique non-background elements (where the background is the majority number in the input). For instance, in Example 0, the majority is 3. The output arrays are formed by taking the non-3 elements and arranging them symmetrically.\n\nLet's check Example 0 again. The first output array is [2,4,1,4,2]. Looking at the input rows, perhaps these numbers come from the positions where they are surrounded by 3s. For example, in the first input row of Example 0, the 4s are at positions 7 and 9. The output's first array has 4 in the middle. Wait, maybe each output row is formed by taking the non-majority elements from the input rows, and arranging them in a diamond or cross pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array is formed by taking the elements from the input rows where the element is not equal to the majority (which in Example 0 is 3). Then, these elements are arranged in a symmetrical pattern. For instance, in the first output of Example 0, the numbers 2,4,1,4,2 could be arranged such that the middle is 1, and 4 and 2 are mirrored around it.\n\nWait, maybe the output arrays are constructed by taking the unique values (excluding the majority) from each column of the input. For example, if the input is arranged as rows, perhaps each column is processed, and the non-majority elements are collected and arranged symmetrically.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as a grid. The output could be a smaller grid that captures some pattern in the input. For example, maybe each output array corresponds to a certain position in the input grid. Let's look at the dimensions. Example 0's input has 12 rows of 11 elements each, and the output has 5 rows of 5 elements. Maybe the output is a central section of the input, but only taking non-majority elements. But the numbers don't directly match.\n\nAnother approach: look for the occurrence of numbers that are not the majority. For each input row, find the positions where the element is different from the majority, then arrange those elements in a way that creates a symmetric output.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,3], the majority is 3. The non-3 elements are 4s at positions 7 and 9. But how does that become part of the output [2,4,1,4,2]?\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by considering each input row and column where there's a non-majority element, and then creating a cross shape or diamond pattern by combining those elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a kind of \"compression\" where each output row is formed by taking the first, middle, and last elements of certain input rows. For example, in Example 1's input, the output arrays have length 3. Let's check:\n\nExample 1's output first array is [8,3,8]. Looking at the input rows, the second row is [1,8,1,8,1,1,1,1]. The non-1 elements are 8s at positions 1 and 3. So maybe the output takes those 8s and a 3 from another row. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output arrays are formed by taking the non-majority elements in the vertical columns. For instance, in Example 0's input, each column may have some non-3 elements, and these are arranged symmetrically in the output.\n\nFor example, let's imagine stacking the input rows into a grid. Then, for each column, collect the non-majority elements. Then, arrange those elements in a symmetric pattern. But how?\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, identify the majority element in each example. For Example 0, most elements are 3, so the majority is 3. The output arrays have elements like 2,4,1, which are not 3. Similarly, in Example 1, the majority is 1. The output arrays have 8,3, etc.\n\nSo, the pattern may involve extracting non-majority elements and arranging them in a specific way.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\n[2,4,1,4,2]\n[8,3,3,3,8]\n[1,3,3,3,1]\n[8,3,3,3,8]\n[2,4,1,4,2]\n\nThese arrays are symmetric. The middle element is the unique one (1 in the first array), and the others mirror around it. The numbers 2,4,8,1 are the non-3 elements from the input.\n\nBut how are they arranged? Let's check the input rows of Example 0. For instance, the row [3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 4, 3, 4, 3] has 1s at positions 2 and 6, and 4s at positions 7 and 9. How does this relate to the output?\n\nThe first output array in Example 0 is [2,4,1,4,2]. Where do the 2s come from? Looking through the input rows, the 2s appear in the 7th row: [3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]. Here, 2 is at positions 6 and 10. But the output array's first and last elements are 2. How does that map?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays are constructed by looking at each position in the input grid where the element is not the majority, and then arranging those elements in a symmetrical pattern. For example, in the input grid, if there's a non-majority element at position (i,j), it might contribute to a certain position in the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the elements that are in the \"cross\" positions of the input grid. For instance, the middle row and middle column, but that doesn't seem to fit the examples.\n\nAnother angle: let's count the number of output arrays. In Example 0, there are 5 output arrays. The input has 12 rows. Maybe each output row corresponds to two input rows, but the count doesn't add up. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The majority is 4. The output arrays include 1,7,3. The first output array is [1,4,7,4,1], which is symmetric. The middle is 7, and 1s on the ends. The second array is all 4s. The third is [7,4,4,4,7]. So maybe when there are multiple non-majority elements, they're arranged in a certain order.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is built by taking the non-majority elements from each input row, starting from the center and expanding outward, creating a symmetric pattern. For example, in the first input row of Example 0, the non-3 elements are 4s at positions 7 and 9 (0-based), which are towards the end. The output array for that might be centered around the 4, but the first output array is [2,4,1,4,2]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output arrays are formed by looking at the positions where the non-majority elements appear in the input rows, and then creating a diamond shape by taking those elements in order. For example, if in the input, the non-majority elements form a diamond pattern when viewed across rows, then the output captures that.\n\nAnother idea: the output arrays are palindromic (symmetric), so perhaps the elements are taken from the input in a way that mirrors around a central axis. For example, the first and last elements of the output array are the same, second and second-last are the same, etc. This seems to hold in all examples.\n\nSo, the main steps could be:\n\n1. Identify the majority element in the entire input (each example's input seems to have a clear majority).\n\n2. For each row in the input, collect the non-majority elements.\n\n3. Arrange these non-majority elements into symmetric arrays, possibly centered around a middle element.\n\nBut how exactly are these elements arranged? Let's look at Example 0's output. The first output array is [2,4,1,4,2]. The non-3 elements in the input rows include 4s, 1s, 8s, and 2s. Let's check which input rows contribute to each output array.\n\nLooking at the output arrays in Example 0:\n\nThe first output array [2,4,1,4,2] has 2 at the ends, 4 next, and 1 in the center. The input rows that have 2s are row 6 and 10 (0-based). The row 6 is [3,3,3,3,1,3,2,3,3,3,2], which has 2s at positions 6 and 10. The output's 2s might be from these positions, but how do they become the first and last elements? Maybe it's arranged in the order of the rows where they appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the central non-majority elements from each row. For example, in each input row, find the center element (or the first non-majority element from the center), and build a diamond pattern by expanding outward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a diamond-shaped pattern where the non-majority elements form layers around the center. For instance, the first layer (outermost) has the elements that are farthest from the center, and inner layers have elements closer.\n\nThis is a bit vague. Let's look for a pattern in the numbers. For example, in Example 0's output:\n\nThe first array is [2,4,1,4,2]. The second is [8,3,3,3,8], then [1,3,3,3,1], then [8,3,3,3,8], then [2,4,1,4,2]. So it's a symmetric pattern both horizontally and vertically. The entire output is a diamond shape where the elements mirror both in rows and columns.\n\nBut how does that relate to the input? Let's imagine that the input is a grid where each row is part of a larger structure. Maybe the output is the diamond formed by the non-majority elements in this grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output array corresponds to a diagonal in the input grid. For example, the middle output array might be the center row of the input, but filtered for non-majority elements and symmetrically arranged.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a kind of \"compression\" where the non-majority elements are arranged in concentric circles. For instance, the first output array corresponds to the outermost ring of non-majority elements, the next to the next ring, etc., but this is speculative.\n\nAnother angle: the length of the output arrays. In Example 0, the output has 5 arrays of length 5. The input has 12 rows. 5 is about half of 11 (the input row length), but not exactly. Alternatively, the output arrays might be formed by taking every other row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle five elements of certain rows. For example, in Example 0's input, the first output array might come from rows 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. But this is unclear.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output arrays:\n\nThe first and last arrays are [2,4,1,4,2], which is the same. The second and fourth are [8,3,3,3,8]. The middle array is [1,3,3,3,1]. So it's a symmetric structure. Maybe the input is being mirrored in some way. For instance, the output is a palindrome vertically as well.\n\nLooking at the input of Example 0:\n\nThe first row is [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,3].\n\nRow 2 (third row) is [3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nRow 4 is [3,3,1,3,3,3,1,4,3,4,3].\n\nRow 6 is [3,3,3,3,1,3,2,3,3,3,2].\n\nRow 8 is [8,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nRow 10 is [8,3,3,3,8,3,2,3,3,3,2].\n\nSo, the non-3 elements in these rows might be contributing to the output. For example, the 4s in row 0, the 1 in row 2, the 1s and 4s in row 4, the 1 and 2s in row 6, the 8s in row 8, and the 8s and 2s in row 10.\n\nThe output arrays have elements like 2,4,1,8,3. Maybe the output is constructed by taking these elements in a certain order, perhaps their positions in the input grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array is formed by the elements in a certain \"ring\" or layer of the input grid, considering it as a 2D array.\n\nBut how to map the input rows to the output arrays. For Example 0's output, there are 5 output arrays, each with 5 elements. Maybe each output array corresponds to a diagonal or a cross-section of the input grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the central columns of the input grid. For example, if the input grid is 12 rows by 11 columns, the middle column is column 5 (0-based). The output might be taking columns around this middle column, but it's unclear.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's output, the middle array is [1,3,3,3,1]. The 1s here might come from the row with 1 in the middle (row 2: [3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3]). So the 1 is at position 4. Then, the output array's middle is 1, surrounded by 3s. But how do the 3s get there? Maybe they're the majority elements.\n\nWait, maybe the output array is formed by taking the non-majority elements from certain positions and padding with the majority to create symmetry. For example, if there's a non-majority element in a row, it's placed in the center, and the rest are filled with the majority. But in Example 0's first output array, the center is 1, which might come from row 2's middle, and then 4s and 2s around it. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays might be constructed by combining elements from multiple input rows. For example, the first output array in Example 0 could be built from the non-majority elements of rows 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, etc., arranged in a symmetric way.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here. Let's try another approach. Let's look at the Test Input and see if we can spot a pattern based on the examples.\n\nThe Test Input has a lot of 8s. The majority is 8. The non-majority elements are 1,2,3,6. Let's look for where these elements appear:\n\nLooking at the Test Input rows:\n\nRow 2: [8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. The 1 is at position 6.\n\nRow 5: [8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. Two 1s at positions 3 and 9.\n\nRow 6: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,8]. Two 2s at positions 11 and 17.\n\nRow 8: [8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,8]. 1 at position 6, 2s at 11 and 17.\n\nRow 9: [8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. 3s at positions 3 and 9.\n\nRow 10: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8]. 6s at positions 14 and 16.\n\nRow 15: [8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. 3s at 3 and 9.\n\nRow 16: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8]. 6s at 14 and 16.\n\nSo the non-8 elements are 1,2,3,6. The output should be a symmetric arrangement of these elements.\n\nIn the examples, the output arrays are symmetric and often start and end with the same number, with other numbers in between. For example, in Example 2, the first output array is [1,4,7,4,1], which has 1 at the ends and 7 in the center. The 1s and 7 are non-majority elements arranged symmetrically.\n\nIn the Test Input, the non-majority elements are 1,2,3,6. How would these be arranged?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the numbers 2,4,1,8 are arranged in a diamond pattern. Maybe the Test Input's output will have arrays like [1,3,6,3,1], [2, something, ...], etc.\n\nAlternatively, considering the positions of the non-8 elements:\n\nRow 2 has a 1 at position 6.\n\nRow 5 has 1s at positions 3 and 9.\n\nRow 6 has 2s at 11 and 17.\n\nRow 8 has 1 at 6, 2s at 11 and 17.\n\nRow 9 has 3s at 3 and 9.\n\nRow 10 has 6s at 14 and 16.\n\nRow 15 has 3s at 3 and 9.\n\nRow 16 has 6s at 14 and 16.\n\nLooking at these positions, maybe the output is formed by the unique non-8 elements in order of their distance from the center of the row. For example, the center of the Test Input's rows (which have length 19) is position 9 (0-based). The elements are at positions 3, 6, 9, 11,14,16,17.\n\nBut how to arrange these into symmetric output arrays. For example, elements at positions 3 and 15 (since 19-1-3=15) would mirror. But looking at the positions of the elements:\n\nRow 5: 3 and 9 (symmetric around 6, the center). Row 9: 3 and 9. Row 15: 3 and 9. So these are symmetric around the center position 9.\n\nRow 6: 11 and 17. 11 is 2 positions from the center (9) to the right, and 17 is 8 positions to the right. Wait, 19-1=18, so position 17 is near the end. Hmm, not symmetric. But 11 and 17: 11 is 2 positions after 9 (9+2=11), 17 is 8 positions after 9 (9+8=17). Not symmetric. Unless the row is considered as a circle, which seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays are formed by taking the unique non-majority elements in the order they appear in the input rows, then arranging them in a symmetric way.\n\nFor example, in the Test Input, the non-8 elements are 1,2,3,6. They appear in the following order:\n\n- 1 (row 2, position 6)\n\n- 1 (row 5, position 3)\n\n- 1 (row 5, position 9)\n\n- 2 (row 6, position 11)\n\n- 2 (row 6, position 17)\n\n- 1 (row 8, position 6)\n\n- 2 (row 8, position 11)\n\n- 2 (row 8, position 17)\n\n- 3 (row 9, position 3)\n\n- 3 (row 9, position 9)\n\n- 6 (row 10, position 14)\n\n- 6 (row 10, position 16)\n\n- 3 (row 15, position 3)\n\n- 3 (row 15, position 9)\n\n- 6 (row 16, position 14)\n\n- 6 (row 16, position 16)\n\nBut this is a lot of elements. How to form symmetric arrays from these?\n\nLooking at the examples again, the output arrays are formed by taking the unique values and arranging them symmetrically. For example, in Example 2, the output arrays include [1,4,7,4,1], which suggests that 1 and 7 are unique non-majority elements, and 4 is the majority.\n\nSo, perhaps the Test Input's output will have arrays that combine these non-8 elements in a symmetric way. Let's see:\n\nThe non-8 elements are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\nLooking for symmetry, possible arrays could be:\n\n[1,3,6,3,1]\n\n[2,6,6,6,2]\n\n[3,1,6,1,3]\n\nBut how to decide the order?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array corresponds to a certain non-majority element and its positions. For example, the first array is for 1s, then 3s, then 6s, etc.\n\nBut in Example 0, the first array includes 2,4,1,4,2. So multiple elements.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are formed by layers. The outermost layer has the elements farthest from the center, and each inner layer has elements closer.\n\nIn the Test Input, the elements at position 3 and 9 (which are 3s and 1s) are closer to the center (position 9). The elements at positions 6 (1), 11 (2), 14 (6), 16 (6), 17 (2) are further away.\n\nSo the layers would be:\n\n- Position 6 (1) and 12 (since 19-1-6=12, but in row 2, position 6 is 1. If mirrored, but there's no element at 12 in that row).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output array is formed by elements that are at the same distance from the center.\n\nFor example, elements at distance 3 from the center (position 9): positions 6 (9-3=6) and 12 (9+3=12). But in row 2, position 6 is 1, but position 12 may be 8 (since the row has 19 elements, and it's filled with 8s except position 6). So perhaps elements at a certain distance are considered.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn the Test Input, the non-8 elements are 1,2,3,6. The output should be symmetric arrays. The first array could be [1,3,6,3,1], capturing the 1s, 3s, and 6s arranged symmetrically. Another array could be [2,6, ...], but I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the first array is [1,4,7,4,1], which includes the non-4 elements 1 and 7. The 4s are the majority. So the pattern seems to be taking the unique non-majority elements, ordering them, and creating a symmetric array with the majority in between.\n\nFor the Test Input, the majority is 8. The non-majority elements are 1,2,3,6. So perhaps the output arrays would look like:\n\n[1,8,3,8,1]\n\n[2,8,6,8,2]\n\nBut the majority is 8, which would be in between. But looking at Example 0's output, the middle element is 1 (non-majority) surrounded by 4s (non-majority) and 2s. So maybe it's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays are formed by taking the unique non-majority elements in the order they appear in the input and arranging them symmetrically. For example, in the Test Input, the first non-8 element is 1, then 1 again, then 2, then 2, then 3, etc. But how to arrange them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output arrays are built by combining the unique non-majority elements from specific rows, creating a diamond pattern.\n\nFor example, the Test Input has rows with 1s, 2s, 3s, and 6s. The output arrays would be:\n\nFirst array: [1,3,6,3,1]\n\nSecond array: [2,8, something, 8,2]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, looking at the Test Input's rows 5 and 9 have 1s and 3s in positions 3 and 9 (which are symmetric around the center). Rows 6 and 8 have 2s and 1s. Rows 10 and 16 have 6s. \n\nMaybe the output arrays are formed by taking these elements in a symmetric order. For example:\n\nRow 5: [8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nNon-8 elements are 1s at positions 3 and 9. So these would form [1,8,8,8,1], but how?\n\nBut in Example 1, the output arrays are [8,3,8], which is the non-1 elements from certain rows arranged symmetrically. The middle element is 3, which is from a row with 3.\n\nIn the Test Input, the rows with non-8 elements:\n\nRow 2: 1 at position 6.\n\nRow5: 1s at 3 and 9.\n\nRow6: 2s at 11 and 17.\n\nRow8: 1 at 6, 2s at 11 and 17.\n\nRow9:3s at 3 and 9.\n\nRow10:6s at 14 and 16.\n\nRow15:3s at 3 and 9.\n\nRow16:6s at 14 and 16.\n\nSo the unique non-8 elements are 1,2,3,6. The positions where they appear are symmetric in some rows. For example, row5 has 1s at positions 3 and 9 (symmetrical around 6, which is the center of a row of length 19? Wait, no, 19 elements, so the center is position 9 (0-based). Position 3 is 6 positions to the left of center, 9 is center. So not symmetric. But row5's 1s are at positions 3 and 9. 3 is 6 positions before 9. Wait, 9-3=6. So they are 6 apart, but not mirrored.\n\nBut if the row length is 19, the center is position 9. So position 3 is 6 before, position 15 is 6 after. But row5's elements are at 3 and 9. So not mirrored. But in row9, the 3s are at 3 and 9. Similarly, row15's 3s are at 3 and 9. So perhaps these are mirrored around position 6, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output arrays are formed by taking the elements that appear at the same positions across different rows. For example, elements at position 3 across the rows.\n\nIn the Test Input, position 3 has:\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow9:3\n\nRow15:3\n\nSo position 3 has 1,3,3.\n\nSimilarly, position9 has 1 (row5),3 (row9),3 (row15).\n\nBut how does this form an output array.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are formed by vertically reading the non-majority elements. For example, column-wise, if any column has non-majority elements, those are arranged symmetrically.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of rows, so columns are vertical. For example, in Example 0, each column is a list of elements from each row at the same position. If there are non-majority elements in a column, they might form part of the output.\n\nFor instance, in Example 0's input, column 7 has a 4 in row 0, 3s in other rows. But the output includes 4 in the first array. So maybe each column's non-majority elements contribute to the output.\n\nBut how to arrange them.\n\nAlternatively, each output array is formed by taking the non-majority elements from a specific set of columns, arranged in a symmetric way.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first array is [2,4,1,4,2]. The elements 2,4,1 are non-3. If we look at the columns where these elements appear:\n\n- 2 appears in columns 6 and 10 (rows 6 and 10).\n\n- 4 appears in columns 7 and 9 (rows 0,4, etc.\n\n- 1 appears in columns 4,6 (rows 2,4,6,8).\n\nBut how to form the output array from this.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are created by taking the non-majority elements from the input and arranging them in a way that each output array's elements come from different rows and columns, forming a symmetric pattern.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll try to hypothesize based on the examples.\n\nThe output arrays are symmetric and consist of non-majority elements arranged in a way that mirrors around the center. The majority element is used to pad the array to achieve symmetry if needed.\n\nFor the Test Input, the majority is 8. The non-majority elements are 1,2,3,6. \n\nLooking at the rows, the elements are arranged in positions that may form a diamond pattern. For example:\n\n- The 1s appear in rows 2,5,8.\n\n- The 2s in rows 6,8.\n\n- The 3s in rows 9,15.\n\n- The 6s in rows 10,16.\n\nPossibly, the output will have arrays like:\n\n[1,3,6,3,1]\n\n[2,8,6,8,2]\n\nBut the 8 is the majority, so it would be used as padding. Alternatively, the output arrays could be:\n\n[1,3,3,3,1]\n\n[2,6,6,6,2]\n\n[3,8,8,8,3]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's look at the examples again. In Example 2, the output includes [1,4,7,4,1], which has the non-majority elements 1 and 7 with the majority 4 in between. So maybe the Test Input's output will have similar arrays.\n\nFor instance:\n\n[1,3,6,3,1] (with 1s and 3s from rows 5,9,15, and 6s from 10,16)\n\n[2,8,8,8,2] (2s from rows 6,8)\n\n[3,8,8,8,3] (3s from rows 9,15)\n\n[6,8,8,8,6] (6s from rows 10,16)\n\nBut how many output arrays would there be? The examples have varying numbers. Example 0 has 5, Example 1 has 3, Example 2 has 5.\n\nThe Test Input's output might have 5 arrays, given that the non-majority elements are more varied.\n\nAlternatively, the number of output arrays depends on the number of distinct layers of non-majority elements.\n\nAnother idea: each output array corresponds to a row in the input that has non-majority elements, transformed into a symmetric array by mirroring the non-majority elements and padding with the majority.\n\nFor example, take row 2 of the Test Input: [8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. The non-8 element is 1 at position 6. The output array for this row would be [8,8,1,8,8], but since the majority is 8, perhaps it's just [1], but the examples don't have single elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output array is formed by taking the non-majority elements in a row and creating a symmetric array, padding with the majority as needed.\n\nFor example, row 5 of the Test Input has two 1s at positions 3 and 9. To make a symmetric array, perhaps it's [1,8,1], but since the examples have longer arrays, maybe padded to length 5: [8,1,8,1,8] \u2192 but that's not symmetric. Wait, symmetric would require mirroring. So [1,8,8,8,1], which is symmetric. But the majority is 8, so this could be possible.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's input row [1,8,1,8,1,1,1,1], the non-1 elements are 8s at positions 1 and 3. The output array is [8,3,8]. So it's taking the 8s and placing them at the ends with 3 (a non-majority element from another row?) in the middle. But this contradicts my previous idea.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Given the time I've spent, I think the pattern is that the output arrays are formed by taking the non-majority elements from the input and arranging them in a symmetric pattern, possibly ordered by their distance from the center of the input grid.\n\nIn the Test Input, the non-majority elements are 1,2,3,6. The output would likely consist of symmetric arrays combining these elements, arranged in a diamond-like pattern. For example:\n\nFirst output array: [1,3,6,3,1]\n\nSecond: [2,6,8,6,2]\n\nThird: [3,1,6,1,3]\n\nBut I'm not certain. Looking back at the examples, the output arrays often have the same elements at the start and end, with other elements in the middle. For instance, in Example 0's first output array: [2,4,1,4,2] \u2014 2 at the ends, 4 next, 1 in the center.\n\nIn the Test Input, perhaps the elements are arranged similarly. The 1s and 3s could form an array like [1,3,6,3,1], and the 2s and 6s could form [2,6,8,6,2], but since the majority is 8, maybe it's used as padding.\n\nBut the Test Input's non-majority elements don't include 8, so perhaps the output arrays are:\n\n[1,3,6,3,1]\n\n[2,6,6,6,2]\n\n[3,1,6,1,3]\n\n[6,8,8,8,6]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering the positions of the elements, the output could be:\n\nThe first output array corresponds to the 1s: [1,8,8,8,1]\n\nThe second to 3s: [3,8,8,8,3]\n\nThird to 2s: [2,8,8,8,2]\n\nFourth to 6s: [6,8,8,8,6]\n\nBut the examples have more complex arrays, like [1,4,7,4,1] which includes three different non-majority elements.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are formed by combining different non-majority elements. For example, the first array could be [1,3,6,3,1], combining 1,3,6. But how are these elements ordered?\n\nIn Example 2's output, the first array is [1,4,7,4,1], which combines 1 and 7 with 4 (majority) in between. So maybe the Test Input's output would have arrays like [1,8,3,8,1], [2,8,6,8,2], etc.\n\nBut the majority is 8, so those would be the padding. So possible output arrays:\n\n[1,8,3,8,1]\n\n[2,8,6,8,2]\n\n[3,8,6,8,3]\n\n[6,8,8,8,6]\n\nBut looking at the examples, the majority element is not used in the output arrays. For instance, in Example 0, the majority is 3, but the output arrays have elements like 2,4,1,8. The majority is only present in the second and fourth arrays of Example 0's output. So perhaps the majority is only used when necessary for symmetry.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\n[8,3,3,3,8] \u2014 here, 8 and 3 are present. 3 is the majority. So it's possible that the majority is included in the output arrays.\n\nIn the Test Input's case, the majority is 8. So output arrays may include 8 as padding.\n\nPutting this all together, the Test Input's output might look like:\n\n[1,3,6,3,1]\n\n[2,6,8,6,2]\n\n[3,8,8,8,3]\n\n[6,8,8,8,6]\n\n[1,3,6,3,1]\n\nBut I'm not certain. The correct answer probably involves symmetric arrays using the non-8 elements. Given that, I'll propose the following output based on the Test Input:\n\nThe output arrays should be symmetric and include the non-8 elements. The non-8 elements are 1,2,3,6. The possible symmetric combinations could be:\n\n[1,3,6,3,1]\n\n[2,6,6,6,2]\n\n[3,1,6,1,3]\n\n[6,8,8,8,6]\n\nBut since the examples often have the majority element in the middle, perhaps the Test Input's output is:\n\n[1,3,6,3,1]\n\n[2,8,8,8,2]\n\n[3,8,8,8,3]\n\n[6,8,8,8,6]\n\n[1,3,6,3,1]\n\nBut I need to check the examples again to see how they handle multiple non-majority elements.\n\nExample 2's output includes [1,4,7,4,1], which has three different elements. So the Test Input could have a similar array combining 1,3,6.\n\nBut how? The 1s are in row 2,5,8; 3s in row9,15; 6s in row10,16.\n\nPerhaps the first array is [1,3,6,3,1], combining these elements.\n\nAnother array could be [2,6,8,6,2], using the 2s and 6s.\n\nAnother could be [3,8,6,8,3].\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input lists and their corresponding outputs. The goal is to find out how the inputs are transformed into the outputs and apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nThe input is a series of lists. The output is a shorter list. Let me check the lengths. The input lists are 11 elements long each, and the output lists are 5 elements each. So maybe there's a reduction in the length. How?\n\nLooking at the first input list in Example 0: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,3]. The output starts with [2,4,1,4,2]. Hmm. Let's see if there's a pattern in the elements. The output elements don't directly match the input's. Maybe it's taking elements from the middle or certain positions?\n\nWait, maybe it's taking the non-3 elements and arranging them in some way. Let's check. The first input line has 4s at positions 7 and 9 (0-based index). The output has 4s in positions 1 and 3. The output starts with 2 and ends with 2. Not sure where that comes from.\n\nLooking at the structure of the input and output. The input has multiple rows, and the output is also multiple rows. Maybe each output row is derived from certain input rows. For example, in Example 0, the output has 5 rows. The input has 12 rows. How are they mapped?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is capturing a kind of cross-section or symmetry. Let's look for symmetry in the input. For instance, the first input row in Example 0 has elements that are mostly 3s except for two 4s. The output row is [2,4,1,4,2]. Maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the middle of the input rows, but how?\n\nAnother angle: maybe each output row is derived from combining certain elements from the input rows. For example, maybe the center element of each row, but in Example 0's first input row, the center is a 3, but the output starts with 2. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by looking for the non-8, non-3 elements and arranging them in a certain pattern. Let's look at Example 1. The output is [8,3,8], [3,1,3], etc. The inputs have 8s and 3s. Maybe each output row is taking the unique elements that are not the majority (like in Example 1, the majority is 1, and the other elements are 8 and 3).\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the majority element is 3. The outputs have 2,4,1, etc. So perhaps the outputs are the non-3 elements arranged in a symmetric pattern. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's first input row: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,3]. The non-3 elements are 4,4. The output for that row is [2,4,1,4,2]. Wait, but where do 2 and 1 come from? That's confusing. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output arrays, they seem to be symmetric. For example, in Example 0's output, the first row is [2,4,1,4,2], which is symmetric. The second row is [8,3,3,3,8], also symmetric. So the output rows are palindromic.\n\nSo perhaps each output row is a symmetric arrangement of certain elements from the input. Now, how are those elements chosen?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: the output rows are [8,3,8], [3,1,3], etc. The input rows have 1s and 8s. The outputs are symmetric. The middle element is 3 or 1. Maybe the middle element comes from the center of the input row. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1, the first input row is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which is all 1s. But the first output row is [8,3,8]. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe not the center.\n\nWait, perhaps each output row is built by taking the first occurrence of a non-majority element on each side. For example, in Example 0's first input row, the majority is 3. The non-3 elements are 4s. So maybe the output is formed by the positions where the elements are not 3, but arranged symmetrically.\n\nBut how does [2,4,1,4,2] come from that? Maybe the numbers are counts of something. Wait, in Example 0's input, the first row has two 4s. But the output has 4 in the middle. Not sure.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is formed by considering each input row and taking the elements that are not the same as the surrounding elements, and then forming a symmetric array. But I'm not seeing a direct connection.\n\nWait, maybe the input is a grid, and the output is a diamond-shaped pattern. For example, in the first example, the output rows are of length 5, which could be a diamond shape with a center. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2's output: [1,4,7,4,1], [4,4,4,4,4], etc. The input has 4s, 1s, and 7s. The output rows are symmetric. The first output row starts and ends with 1, then 4, then 7. So maybe the unique non-majority elements arranged in order.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be taking elements from the input rows that are in certain positions relative to the middle. For example, the middle element of the input row, and elements a certain distance left and right.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row (length 11), the middle is position 5 (0-based index 5). The elements around it are 3s except for positions 7 and 9 (values 4). The output row is [2,4,1,4,2]. Not sure how that's derived.\n\nWait, perhaps the outputs are constructed by taking the unique values from each \"layer\" of the input grid. For example, if the input is a 2D grid, the output might be layers where each layer is formed by the unique non-background values (background being the majority element, like 3 in Example 0).\n\nBut how to determine the order? For Example 0's output, the first output row is [2,4,1,4,2]. Maybe these values are taken from different rows in the input, arranged symmetrically.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is capturing a cross pattern. For example, in each layer of the input grid, the output captures the elements in a cross shape (vertical and horizontal middle elements) arranged in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is a 2D grid where each row is a list, and the output is formed by taking the elements that are different from the majority in their respective positions across multiple rows. For instance, if most rows have 3 in a certain column, but some have 4, then the output captures those 4s.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as layers of a 3D structure. The output could be a projection or a slice that captures certain elements.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput has 12 rows. Output has 5 rows. Maybe each output row is a combination of certain input rows. For example, the first output row [2,4,1,4,2] might correspond to rows 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking elements from the input rows in a way that forms a diamond pattern. For instance, the middle element of the output could be from the middle row of the input, and the surrounding elements from rows above and below.\n\nBut this is getting a bit vague. Let me look for another angle.\n\nAnother observation: The outputs are all odd-length lists. For example, in Example 0's output, each list has 5 elements. In Example 1, 3 elements. Example 2, 5 elements. So perhaps the length of the output lists is related to the number of layers or steps in the pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input, which has 19 elements per row. The output would likely have a similar odd-length, maybe 5 or 7 elements.\n\nAnother thought: The output lists seem to have the same structure as the input lists but condensed. For example, in Example 0, the first input row has 11 elements, and the output row has 5. Maybe the output is taking every other element, starting and ending with a certain position. Let's check:\n\nInput row 0: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,3] (length 11). If we take elements at positions 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 (every other), that gives [3,3,3,3,3,3], which doesn't match the output. Alternatively, taking the center and moving out. The middle is position 5. Taking positions 3,4,5,6,7: [3,3,3,3,4]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by the unique elements that are not the majority, arranged symmetrically. For example, in Example 0's first input row, majority is 3. The other elements are 4s. The output is [2,4,1,4,2]. Hmm, but where do 2 and 1 come from?\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers in the output are not directly taken from the input but are counts of something. For instance, in Example 0's output [2,4,1,4,2], maybe the 2s are the number of 4s in certain positions. But that doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a palindrome formed by the non-majority elements in the input, ordered in a way that creates symmetry. For example, in Example 0's first input row, the 4s are at positions 7 and 9. If mirrored around the center, maybe the output captures those positions. But the output starts with 2, which isn't present in the input.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me look at another example. Example 2's output has [1,4,7,4,1]. The input has elements 1, 4, 7. The output seems to arrange them symmetrically, starting and ending with 1, then 4, then 7 in the center. So maybe the output is capturing the unique non-majority elements in order of their first occurrence, arranged symmetrically. The majority in Example 2's input is 4. So the non-majority elements are 1 and 7. The output rows arrange these in a symmetric way.\n\nBut how are they ordered? In Example 2's first output row, it's 1,4,7,4,1. The 7 is in the center. So perhaps the elements are ordered by their distance from the center, with the rarest element in the middle.\n\nBut then, in Example 0's first output row [2,4,1,4,2], the numbers 2,4,1. Where do these come from? The input row has 3s and 4s. So maybe the majority is 3, and the output uses numbers that are present in adjacent rows or columns.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by looking at the input as a 2D grid and capturing elements that form a certain pattern. For example, if the input is a grid, the output could be the elements along a diamond-shaped path, collecting unique elements from each layer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is a combination of elements from multiple input rows. For instance, the first output row in Example 0 is formed by taking elements from input rows 0, 2, 4, etc. But I need to check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the output has 5 rows. The input has 12 rows. So maybe each output row corresponds to two input rows. Let's see:\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [2,4,1,4,2] \u2192 perhaps from input rows 0 and 10?\n\nInput row 0: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,3]\n\nInput row 10: [8,3,3,3,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nBut the output row starts with 2. Maybe taking elements where the input rows have non-3 values. The output elements are 2,4,1,4,2. Where do these come from?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the unique values from each pair of input rows, arranged symmetrically.\n\nThis is getting a bit too vague. Let's try another approach. Maybe the output is the result of applying a specific transformation to each input row. For example, for each row in the input, the output row is generated by taking the first, third, fifth, etc., elements, but that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the central five elements of each input row when the input row is longer. For example, in Example 0's input rows (length 11), the central five elements would be positions 3 to 7 (0-based). Let's check:\n\nInput row 0: positions 3-7: [3,3,3,4,3]. The output is [2,4,1,4,2]. Doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a combination of elements from the input rows that form a cross. For example, the middle element of each row, and elements from the middle column.\n\nBut the input has varying row lengths. Example 0 has rows of length 11. The test input has rows of length 19. The output rows are shorter. So maybe the middle element and two elements on each side, creating a symmetric output of length 5.\n\nFor a row of length 11, the middle element is at position 5. Taking positions 3,4,5,6,7: but in input row 0, that's [3,3,3,4,3]. Output row is [2,4,1,4,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by taking elements from the input rows where the elements differ from their neighbors. For example, if an element is not equal to its left and right neighbors, it's included in the output. But how that would form a symmetric list.\n\nAnother thought: The outputs in all examples are palindromes. So whatever the transformation is, it results in a palindrome. So maybe for each row in the input, the output is the unique elements arranged in a palindrome.\n\nBut how? For Example 0's first input row, the unique non-3 elements are 4. So how do we get [2,4,1,4,2] from that?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are constructed by taking the counts of certain elements in the input rows. For example, counting the number of times a non-majority element appears in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by looking at the input as a 2D grid and finding the minimal enclosing rectangle around non-majority elements and then creating a symmetric pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived from the positions of the non-majority elements. For example, in Example 0's input, the 4s are at positions 7 and 9 (0-based) in the first row. The output has 4s at positions 1 and 3. Maybe the positions are being mapped modulo some number. 7 mod 5 is 2, but the output positions are 1 and 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a compression of the input rows, keeping only the non-majority elements and mirroring them. For example, if an input row has non-majority elements at certain positions, those are arranged symmetrically in the output.\n\nBut in Example 0's first input row, there are two 4s. To make a symmetric output of 5 elements, maybe the output has those 4s in mirrored positions, and the middle element is something else. But the output has 1 in the middle. Where does that come from?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, perhaps the 1 in the output comes from a different row. For example, the output rows may be combinations of elements from multiple input rows. For instance, the first output row [2,4,1,4,2] might combine elements from the first, third, and fifth input rows.\n\nLooking at input row 4: [3,3,1,3,3,3,1,4,3,4,3]. It has 1s at positions 2 and 6. Maybe the 1 in the output's middle comes from here.\n\nBut how do the 2s come into play? The output starts and ends with 2. Maybe those are counts of certain elements in the columns across the input rows.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to look for another pattern. Notice that in the test input, the rows are mostly 8s, with some 1s, 2s, 3s, and 6s. The output should be symmetric rows. Let's see:\n\nIn the test input, rows 2 and 8 have a 1. Rows 5, 9, 15 have 3s. Rows 6 and 16 have 2s and 6s. So perhaps the output will have rows that are symmetric combinations of these numbers.\n\nFor example, the first output row might be [1,8, something, 8,1], but the majority is 8, so non-8 elements would be 1,2,3,6. But how to arrange them.\n\nAlternatively, the output will capture the unique non-8 elements in a symmetric pattern. For instance, rows with 1s could lead to an output row [1,8, ...], but not sure.\n\nAnother angle: In the training examples, each output row seems to have elements that are present in the corresponding input rows. For example, in Example 0's first output row [2,4,1,4,2], the numbers 2,4,1 are present in the input rows. But how?\n\nLooking at input rows in Example 0:\n\nRow 0: has 4s.\n\nRow 2: has a 1.\n\nRow 4: has 1s and a 4.\n\nRow 6: has 2s.\n\nRow 8: has 8s.\n\nRow 10: has 8s and 2s.\n\nSo the output rows are combining these elements in a symmetric way. For example, the first output row [2,4,1,4,2] could be combining 2 from row 6 or 10, 4 from row 0 or 4, and 1 from row 2 or 4.\n\nBut how are they combined? Maybe each output row is a combination of elements from different input rows in a certain pattern. For instance, the first output row could be taking elements from the first, third, fifth, etc., rows and arranging them symmetrically.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are layers that capture the non-majority elements from different depths of the input grid. For example, the outer layers have 8s and 2s, middle layers have 4s and 1s, leading to the output rows.\n\nAlternatively, considering the input as a 3D cube, the output is a horizontal slice that captures the varying elements. But this is speculative.\n\nLet me think of the test input. The majority element is 8. The non-8 elements are 1, 2, 3, 6. So the output should have symmetric rows composed of these numbers. Let's see where they appear:\n\n- 1 appears in row 2, 5, 8, 15.\n\n- 2 appears in row 6, 8, 16.\n\n- 3 appears in row 9, 15.\n\n- 6 appears in row 10, 16.\n\nThe output rows need to be symmetric. For example, a possible row could be [1,8,3,8,1] or [3,8,6,8,3], etc., but how to determine the correct pattern.\n\nLooking back at the training examples:\n\nExample 1's input has majority 1. The output rows have 8,3,8 and 3,1,3. So the non-majority elements (8,3) are arranged symmetrically with the middle being 3 or 1. Wait, the middle of the output row is the majority element? No, in Example 1's first output row [8,3,8], the middle is 3 which is not the majority. The majority is 1.\n\nHmm. So maybe the output rows are capturing elements from different layers. For example, the first output row in Example 1 is [8,3,8]. The input has rows with 8s and 3s. So perhaps the output rows are constructed by taking elements from rows that have these non-majority elements and arranging them symmetrically.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by taking the non-majority elements from the input rows and arranging them in a diamond shape. For instance, the middle element of the output is the deepest layer's non-majority element, and the layers outward are from higher layers.\n\nThis is still unclear. Let me try to see if there's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. For each input row, identify the majority element (the one that appears the most). This is the background.\n\n2. For each row, collect the non-background elements.\n\n3. Arrange these elements in a symmetric pattern, possibly ordered by their first occurrence or their value.\n\n4. The length of the output row depends on the number of unique non-background elements or some other factor.\n\nBut how does this work for Example 0:\n\nMajority is 3.\n\nNon-background elements in the input rows are 4,1,2,8.\n\nThe output rows are combinations of these elements arranged symmetrically. For example, [2,4,1,4,2] \u2013 2 is from row 6 and 10, 4 from row 0, and 1 from row 2 and 4.\n\nBut why this particular combination?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a diamond pattern where each layer includes elements from different rows. For example, the outer layers have higher numbers, moving inward.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first row has 2 (possibly from row 6 or 10), then 4 (row 0 or 4), then 1 (row 2 or 4), then 4 again, then 2. This could be a diamond where the outermost layer is 2, next layer 4, innermost 1.\n\nSimilarly, the test input has non-8 elements 1,2,3,6. The output might be arranged with the outermost elements being 6, then 3, then 2, then 1 in the center, or some similar hierarchy.\n\nBut how to confirm this?\n\nLooking at Example 2's output:\n\n[1,4,7,4,1], [4,4,4,4,4], [7,4,4,4,7], etc.\n\nHere, majority is 4. The non-majority elements are 1 and 7. The first output row starts and ends with 1, then 4, then 7 in the center. The third row starts and ends with 7, which is the highest number. So perhaps the order is based on the numerical value, with higher numbers in the center.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is to arrange the non-majority elements in increasing order towards the center. But in Example 0's first output row, [2,4,1,4,2], the numbers are 2,4,1. That doesn't fit. Unless 1 is considered lower than 2 and 4. But in that case, the center should be 1, which it is. So perhaps the non-majority elements are arranged in order of their values, with the smallest in the center and increasing outward. But in Example 0's case, 1 is the smallest, then 2, then 4. The output row is [2,4,1,4,2], which has 1 in the center. So maybe that's the pattern: non-majority elements are ordered by their value, with the smallest in the center, then the next higher, etc., creating a palindrome.\n\nIn Example 2's first output row, the elements are 1,4,7,4,1. The non-majority elements are 1 and 7. 1 is smaller than 7, so 1 is on the outside and 7 in the center. Wait, but that doesn't fit. The output is 1,4,7,4,1. Oh wait, 4 is the majority element here. So perhaps the majority element is used as filler in the output. For example, the output is constructed by placing the non-majority elements in the center and padding with the majority element. So in Example 2's first output row, the non-majority elements are 1 and 7, but perhaps they're arranged as 1 at the ends and 7 in the middle, with 4s (majority) in between. But the actual output is [1,4,7,4,1], which fits that pattern: 1, then 4, then 7 in the center, then 4, then 1.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 0's first output row, [2,4,1,4,2], the non-majority elements are 2,4,1. The majority is 3. Wait, but 4 is also a non-majority element. Hmm. If the majority is 3, then non-majority elements are 4,1,2,8. But in the output row, the elements are 2,4,1,4,2. So the 2 is at the ends, then 4, then 1 in the center. So the order is based on their value, with 1 (smallest) in the center, then 4, then 2 (but 2 is smaller than 4, which contradicts). Wait, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the order is based on the order of appearance in the input. For Example 0's first output row, the non-majority elements in the input rows are first 4, then 1, then 2, then 8. But the output is [2,4,1,4,2]. Maybe the order is based on the layers where they appear. For example, 2 appears in later rows, so it's placed on the outside, 4 in middle layers, and 1 in the center.\n\nBut this is speculative. Another example: Example 1's output row [8,3,8]. The non-majority elements are 8 and 3. The majority is 1. The output has 8 at the ends and 3 in the middle. 3 is higher than 8 (no), so that doesn't fit. Or perhaps based on order of appearance: 8 appears first in the input, then 3. But the output has 8 at the ends and 3 in the middle.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's try to think of the test input and what the output should look like.\n\nTest input has majority 8. The non-majority elements are 1,2,3,6. These appear in various rows. For example, row 5 has 1s, row 6 has 2s, row 8 has 1 and 2, row 9 has 3s, row 10 has 6s, row 15 has 3s, row 16 has 6s.\n\nIf the output is constructed by taking these elements and arranging them in a symmetric pattern, ordered by their value or appearance, then possible output rows could be:\n\n- [1,8,3,8,1] (using 1 and 3)\n\n- [3,8,6,8,3] (using 3 and 6)\n\n- [2,8,6,8,2] (using 2 and 6)\n\nBut how to determine which ones to use.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the output includes elements from different non-majority elements. So maybe each output row corresponds to a specific non-majority element's pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the non-majority elements from each column of the input grid and arranging them symmetrically.\n\nFor example, if the input is a grid of rows and columns, for each column, if there's a non-majority element, it's included in the output. But how to form the output rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by taking the first occurrence of each non-majority element along the columns and arranging them in a symmetric way.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to be sure. Given the time constraints, I'll try to come up with a possible pattern and apply it to the test input.\n\nBased on the training examples, the output seems to capture non-majority elements arranged in a symmetric pattern, ordered by their value with the smallest in the center. For example, in Example 0's first output row: 2 (higher) at the ends, 4 (middle) next, 1 (smallest) in the center. Wait, but 1 is smaller than 2 and 4, so why is 1 in the center? Maybe the order is reverse.\n\nAlternatively, the elements are ordered based on their occurrence in the input. For Example 0, 4 appears first, then 1, then 2, then 8. The output row [2,4,1,4,2] has 2 at the ends and 1 in the center, which might not fit. So this approach might not be correct.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output rows are formed by taking the unique non-majority elements from the input rows and arranging them in a palindrome, with the elements ordered based on their first occurrence in the input. For example, if the first non-majority element encountered is 4, then 1, then 2, the palindrome would be 2,4,1,4,2.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, the first non-majority element is 4 (row 0), then 1 (row 2), then 2 (row 6), then 8 (row 8). So the output row [2,4,1,4,2] includes 2,4,1. Perhaps the output is taking the last three non-majority elements and creating a palindrome around them.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by the unique non-majority elements in the order they appear in the input, then mirrored. For example, if the elements are 4,1,2,8, the output would take the first three and mirror them: 4,1,2,1,4. But Example 0's output has 2,4,1,4,2, which doesn't match.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output rows are formed by taking the non-majority elements from the input rows, ordered by their first occurrence, arranged in a symmetric palindrome, with the majority element filling in the gaps if needed. For example, in the test input, the non-majority elements are 1,2,3,6. The first occurrence of these elements is in rows 2 (1), 6 (2), 9 (3), 10 (6). So the order is 1,2,3,6. But since the output rows need to be symmetric and odd-length, perhaps the longest output row will have 5 elements, with the middle being the last element in the order. So for the test input, the output rows might be:\n\n[1,8,3,8,1], [2,8,6,8,2], etc.\n\nBut how to determine which rows in the test input correspond to which output rows.\n\nLooking at the test input rows:\n\nRow 2: 1 at position 6.\n\nRow 5: 1 at positions 3 and 9.\n\nRow 6: 2 at positions 11 and 17.\n\nRow 8: 1 at position 6 and 2 at position 11.\n\nRow 9: 3 at positions 3 and 9.\n\nRow 10: 6 at positions 14 and 16.\n\nRow 15: 3 at positions 3 and 9.\n\nRow 16: 6 at positions 14 and 16.\n\nSo the non-majority elements are distributed across these rows. The output rows would need to capture these in a symmetric manner.\n\nFor example, the output might have rows:\n\n[1,8,8,8,1] (for row 2 and 5 with 1s)\n\n[2,8,8,8,2] (for row 6)\n\n[3,8,8,8,3] (for row 9 and 15)\n\n[6,8,8,8,6] (for row 10 and 16)\n\nBut in the training examples, the output rows sometimes include multiple non-majority elements. For example, Example 0's first output row has 2,4,1,4,2. So perhaps each output row combines multiple non-majority elements.\n\nAlternatively, each output row corresponds to a pair of mirrored non-majority elements. For instance, in the test input, rows with 1s at positions 3 and 9 (row 5 and 15) would form an output row [1,3,8,3,1] if they have 3s as well. But not sure.\n\nGiven the complexity, I'll assume that each output row is formed by taking the non-majority elements from specific input rows and arranging them symmetrically, ordered by their value with the smallest in the center. For the test input, the non-majority elements are 1,2,3,6. Ordered by value: 1,2,3,6. So the output rows would have 1 in the center, then 2, then 3, then 6. But the output needs to be a palindrome. For example, the first row could be [6,3,2,1,2,3,6], but since the output in the examples is 5 elements, it's likely 5 elements. So the middle element is the smallest (1), surrounded by next smallest (2), then next (3), then largest (6), but that doesn't fit the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by the unique non-majority elements in the order of their first occurrence, arranged in a symmetric pattern. For the test input, the first non-majority elements are 1, then 2, then 3, then 6. So the output rows might be:\n\n[1,2,3,6,3,2,1], but again, the examples have shorter outputs. So perhaps each output row is a combination of two elements mirrored around the center. For example:\n\nFor the 1s and 3s, maybe [1,3,8,3,1] (assuming 8 is the majority filler), but in Example 1, the majority is 1 and the output rows have 8 and 3. So the filler is the majority element.\n\nSo for the test input, majority is 8. So the output rows would have non-8 elements arranged with 8 as filler.\n\nFor example, a row with 1s might be [1,8,8,8,1], but in Example 1, the output has [8,3,8], which uses the majority 1 as filler. Wait, no. Example 1's majority is 1, and the output rows have 8 and 3, with 1 as filler. For example, [8,3,8] would be 8,3,8 with 1s in between? No, the output is [8,3,8], implying that the filler is not used. Maybe the output is only the non-majority elements arranged with their own symmetry, without filler.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the non-majority elements arranged in a way that forms a palindrome, with the majority elements omitted.\n\nIn Example 0's first output row, [2,4,1,4,2], these are all non-3 elements arranged symmetrically. Similarly, in Example 1's first output row, [8,3,8], which are non-1 elements.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is: for each group of input rows, extract the non-majority elements and arrange them in a symmetric pattern.\n\nFor the test input, the non-majority elements are 1,2,3,6. They appear in various rows. The output would be several symmetric rows combining these elements.\n\nLooking at the test input, the non-majority elements appear in rows:\n\nRow 2: 1\n\nRow 5: 1,1\n\nRow 6: 2,2\n\nRow 8:1,2\n\nRow9:3,3\n\nRow10:6,6\n\nRow15:3,3\n\nRow16:6,6\n\nSo possible output rows:\n\n[1,1], but need to be symmetric with odd length. Maybe [1,8,1] (but 8 is majority). But the output examples don't include the majority element. So perhaps the output rows are the non-majority elements arranged as they appear in the input rows.\n\nFor example, row 5 has two 1s. So output row [1,1], but since outputs are symmetric, maybe [1, something, 1]. But in Example 1, the output row [8,3,8] comes from input rows with 8 and 3. So maybe for row 5 in the test input, which has 1s, the output row is [1,1], but the training examples show odd lengths, so perhaps [1,8,1] (if filler is used). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the unique non-majority elements from each input row arranged in a symmetric way. For example, row 5 has 1s at positions 3 and 9. The output row would be [1,1], but need to be symmetric with odd length. So maybe [1,8,1] using filler.\n\nBut in the training examples, the output rows don't include the majority filler. For example, in Example 1's input, the majority is 1, and the output rows are [8,3,8] and [3,1,3]. The latter includes the majority 1 in the middle. So perhaps when there's an odd number of non-majority elements, the majority is used in the center.\n\nFor example, in row 5 of the test input, two 1s. To make a symmetric output of length 3, it would be [1,8,1]. But in Example 1, the output row [3,1,3] has the majority 1 in the center. So maybe that's the case.\n\nApplying this logic to the test input:\n\nFor each input row, collect the non-8 elements. If there are an even number of them, arrange them mirrored, possibly adding the majority in the center if needed.\n\nBut the output examples show that sometimes the majority is present in the output. Like in Example 1's output [3,1,3], where 1 is the majority. So perhaps when the non-majority elements are not enough to form a symmetric row, the majority is used to fill.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll proceed to predict the test output based on the following pattern:\n\nFor each group of input rows that have non-majority elements, arrange those elements in a symmetric palindrome, ordered by their value, with the smallest in the center. The output rows are formed by taking these elements and padding with majority elements if needed to create symmetry.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nNon-majority elements are 1,2,3,6. Ordered by value: 1,2,3,6.\n\nPossible output rows:\n\n- For rows with 1s: [1,8,8,8,1]\n\n- For rows with 2s: [2,8,8,8,2]\n\n- For rows with 3s: [3,8,8,8,3]\n\n- For rows with 6s: [6,8,8,8,6]\n\n- For rows with multiple elements, like row 8 (1 and 2), the output might be [1,2,8,2,1] or [2,1,8,1,2], but unsure.\n\nBut considering the training examples, when multiple elements are present, they are arranged in order of their values. For example, Example 0's output row [2,4,1,4,2] has 1 in the center, then 4, then 2. Which is ordered by value (1 < 4 < 2?), which doesn't make sense. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the elements are arranged based on their first occurrence. In Example 0's input, 4 appears first, then 1, then 2. So the output row is [2,4,1,4,2]. The center is the latest element, and the ends are the earliest. But this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll make an educated guess that the output rows are symmetric palindromes of the non-majority elements, ordered by their value with the smallest in the center, and the majority element used to pad if needed. For the test input, the possible output rows would be:\n\n[1,8,8,8,1]\n\n[2,8,8,8,2]\n\n[3,8,8,8,3]\n\n[6,8,8,8,6]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, sometimes the majority element isn't used. For instance, Example 2's output has [1,4,7,4,1], where 4 is the majority, so it's used as filler between the non-majority elements 1 and 7. Similarly, the test input's non-majority elements would use 8 as filler.\n\nBut in Example 0's first output row [2,4,1,4,2], the filler is not the majority (3), so this contradicts that idea. Thus, perhaps the filler isn't used and the output consists only of the non-majority elements arranged in a symmetric way.\n\nGiven that, for the test input rows containing 1s, 2s, 3s, and 6s, the outputs would be:\n\nFor rows with two 1s: [1,1]\n\nBut output rows need to be odd-length. So maybe [1,8,1], but how?\n\nAlternatively, the outputs are formed by taking the unique non-majority elements from each input row and arranging them in a symmetric pattern. For example, row 5 has two 1s, so the output row is [1,1]. But since outputs in examples have odd lengths, perhaps they're extended with the majority element. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed to guess that the test output will have rows like:\n\n[1,8,8,8,1]\n\n[2,8,8,8,2]\n\n[3,8,8,8,3]\n\n[6,8,8,8,6]\n\nAnd these will be arranged based on the layers where the non-majority elements appear.\n\nBut looking at the test input's structure, there are multiple rows with the same non-majority elements. For example, rows 5 and 15 have 1s and 3s. Rows 6 and 16 have 2s and 6s. So the output might have rows combining these elements.\n\nFor example, a row combining 1 and 3 might be [1,3,8,3,1], and a row combining 2 and 6 might be [2,6,8,6,2]. But how to determine the order.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are ordered based on the first occurrence of the non-majority elements. For example, 1 appears first, then 2, then 3, then 6. So the output rows would be:\n\n[1,8,8,8,1]\n\n[2,8,8,8,2]\n\n[3,8,8,8,3]\n\n[6,8,8,8,6]\n\nBut the output examples in the training data have more complex patterns. For example, Example 0's output has multiple different elements in a single row. So perhaps the test output includes such combinations.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to generate the output for the test input as follows:\n\nThe output will have symmetric rows composed of the non-majority elements, ordered by their first occurrence and arranged in a diamond shape. For example, the first non-majority element is 1, then 2, then 3, then 6. The output rows would be:\n\n[1,8,3,8,1]\n\n[2,8,6,8,2]\n\n[3,8,6,8,3]\n\n[6,8,6,8,6]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given the time, I'll provide an answer based on the training examples' structure.",
