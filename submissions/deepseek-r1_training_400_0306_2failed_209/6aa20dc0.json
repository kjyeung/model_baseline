        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. The user provided three training examples and a test input. The goal is to find out how the input lists are transformed into the output lists and apply that to the test case.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nIn the input, there are rows with numbers like 2, 8, 8, etc. The output seems to shift some numbers to the right. For instance, in the second row of input, there's a 2 followed by 1s. In the output, that 2 is followed by 8,8. So maybe numbers are being shifted and replaced with higher numbers?\n\nWait, let's check the first example more carefully. The input rows have some numbers like 2, 8, 8 in row 4. The output for row 1 (input row 1) has 2 followed by 8,8. Similarly, the third input row has a 3 in position 15, and the output row 3 has 3 preceded by 8. So maybe when a number (like 2 or 3) is present, the following elements are replaced with higher numbers (like 8s) moving to the right?\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput rows have some 2s and 6s. The output rows seem to add sequences of 1s around the 2s. For instance, in the input row 7, there are 2,2,2. In the output, those 2s are preceded by 1,1,1,1,1,1. So maybe inserting lower numbers before certain elements?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where certain numbers cause the previous or next elements to change. Maybe when a number is found, it's creating a sort of \"spreading\" effect. Like in Example 0, the 2 in the input's second row leads to 8s appearing to the right in the output. Similarly, in Example 1, the 2s in the input have 1s added to the left.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe each row in the output is a shifted version of the input row, but with certain elements duplicated or spread. For instance, in Example 0's row 1 (input) has [..., 2, 1, ...], and output row 1 is [..., 2,8,8,...]. The 1 is replaced by 8,8. Maybe when a number higher than the surrounding is found, it duplicates or spreads to the right with higher numbers?\n\nBut in Example 2, the input has a 4 in a row, and the output adds a 3 next to it. For instance, in row 10 of the input, there's a 4, and in the output, it's followed by 3. Then in the next rows, 3s spread. So maybe the numbers are being replaced by a sequence that steps down? Like 4 becomes 4,3,3,3... or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with a sequence that starts with the original number and then decreases. For example, in Example 2's output row 10, the input has 4, which becomes 4,3 in the output. Then the next row has 3,3,3, and then the next row has 3,2. So maybe a cascade where higher numbers spread to the right with lower numbers.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern might be that whenever a number (let's call it N) appears in the input, it is followed by numbers decreasing by 1 in the output, possibly shifted to the right. But how many times does this happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the output are a combination of the original number and some adjacent numbers from the input. For example, in Example 0's row 1, the 2 in the input leads to 2 followed by 8s. But where did the 8s come from? Looking at the input, row 4 has 8s in the input. Wait, maybe the transformation is taking numbers from the same position in the next rows? Or perhaps the output is a shifted version of the input, combining elements from adjacent rows.\n\nWait, perhaps each output row is a combination of the same row and the row below from the input. For example, in Example 0's output row 1, the 2 is followed by 8,8. Looking at the input row 4 (since output row 1 corresponds to input row 1?), maybe the 8s are taken from the input row below. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 0, input row 1 has a 2. The output row 1 has 2 followed by 8,8. Looking at input row 4, which is the fifth row (since rows are 0-indexed?), row 4 of the input has 8s starting at position 5. So maybe the 2 in row 1 of the input is followed by the 8s from row 4, shifted left or right.\n\nThis seems complicated. Another approach: look for each position in the input and see how it's transformed in the output. For example, in Example 0's input row 1, the 2 is at position 13. In the output row 1, positions 13,14,15 are 2,8,8. So maybe the 2 is kept, and the next two positions are filled with 8s. But where do the 8s come from? In the input, the 8s are in row 4, positions 5 and 6. So perhaps there's a vertical component, taking elements from rows below.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking each row and, for each number that's not 1 (assuming the default is 1 in Example 0), the following positions are filled with numbers from a higher value. Like, a number N in the input causes the next few positions to be filled with N+1 or similar. But in Example 0, 2 is followed by 8s, which are higher. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input row 5 (which is the 6th line in the input) has [8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,8...], and the output row 5 is the same. But in output row 10, the input's 4 becomes 4,3. Then in output row 11, the 4 (from input row 10) is now followed by 3,3,3. Then in row 12, the 2 is followed by 3,2. So perhaps when a number appears, it's followed by a sequence that starts with the number and then decreases by 1 each step, but this depends on adjacent elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number in the input causes a rightward expansion in the output, where the number is followed by the same number minus one. For example, a 2 would become 2,1. But in Example 0's output, the 2 is followed by 8s. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that certain numbers (like 2,3, etc.) in the input act as \"seeds\" that, in the output, generate a sequence of numbers that are either the same or lower, spreading to the right. For example, in Example 0's input row 1, the 2 is followed by two 8s. Maybe the 8s are taken from the row below. Because in input row 4, which is a few rows down, there's a 8,8 in positions 5-6. So perhaps the output is combining elements from the same column in subsequent rows.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent. Let's look at Example 1. Input row 7 has [4,4,...,2,2,2...]. Output row 7 has 1s followed by 2,2,2. The 1s are new. Where do the 1s come from? Looking at the input rows above row 7, maybe row 3 and 4 have 1s. For example, input row 3 has 1,4,1, etc. So maybe the 1s are taken from the rows above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number in the input is replaced by a block of numbers. For instance, in Example 1's input row 7, the 2s are preceded by six 1s. The 1s are in the same positions as earlier rows. So maybe the output is inserting the numbers from previous rows into the current row.\n\nBut this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to see if there's a common transformation across all examples.\n\nAnother approach: Compare the input and output row by row for each example.\n\nTake Example 0:\n\nInput row 1 (second row) is [1,1,...,2,1,...]. Output row 1 is [1,1,...,2,8,8,...]. The 2 is followed by 8s. Where do the 8s come from? Looking at the input rows below, row 4 in the input has 8s starting at position 5. So perhaps the 2 in row 1 causes the next two elements to be replaced with 8s from row 4's positions 5-6.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 0's input row 3, there's a 3 at position 15. The output row 3 has 8,1,3. The 8 might be coming from row 6 in the input, which has 8 at position 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the current row and the next few rows, shifting elements to the right. For example, when a number appears, it's followed by numbers from the row below, shifted right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by shifting certain elements to the right and filling with values from the same column in subsequent rows.\n\nIn Example 2's output, the input row 10 (which has a 4) becomes [...,4,3] in the output row 10. Then the next row (11) in the output has [...,3,3,3], and row 12 has [...,3,2]. It looks like the 4 in row 10 is causing a sequence of 3s and then 2 to the right. So maybe a number N in the input leads to N-1 in the following positions, propagating to the right.\n\nBut in Example 0, the 2 is followed by 8s, which are higher. So that contradicts the N-1 idea.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is the input but with certain blocks expanded. For example, in Example 0, the 2 in the input row 1 is part of a vertical sequence. The output might be creating a horizontal expansion of that.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could involve moving numbers from lower rows into the current row, shifted right. For example, in Example 0's input row 1, the 2 is followed by 8s from row 4, shifted right by a certain number of positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Let's look for a pattern in how the numbers are shifted.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput row 1 (second row) has a 2 at position 13. Output row 1 has 2 at position 13, then 8,8. The 8s come from input row 4, positions 5 and 6 (columns 5-6). The difference in rows is 3 (row 1 to row 4), and the columns shift from 5-6 to 14-15. That's a shift of 9 columns. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are taken from the same row but shifted. Wait, input row 4 has 8s starting at position 5, but in output row 1, the 8s are at positions 14-15. That's a big shift. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the input rows with certain elements \"falling\" down and to the right. For example, a number in row i, column j in the input may appear in row i+3, column j+3 in the output. But this is speculative.\n\nLooking at Example 2 again, the input row 5 has 2 and 3. The output row 5 is the same. Then in row 10 of the input, there's a 4. In the output row 10, it's followed by 3. Then row 11 has 3,3,3, and row 12 has 3,2. So perhaps the 4 in row 10 leads to a 3 in the next column of the same row, then in the next row, that 3 spreads to three 3s, and then a 2. This looks like a diagonal spread downward and to the right.\n\nSo maybe when a number N is present, it creates a diagonal of N-1, N-2, etc., moving down and to the right. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 1, there's a 2. In the output, the next rows (rows 1-3) have 8s appearing to the right. But 8 is higher than 2, which doesn't fit N-1. Hmm. So this theory might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each number in the input is replaced by a sequence that starts with the number and then includes the numbers from the next row in the same or adjacent columns. For example, in Example 1's input row 7, the 2s are preceded by 1s from the rows above. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each element and, if it's not the background value (like 1 in Example 0, 4 in Example 1, 8 in Example 2), then it's expanded into a block of that number and possibly others in adjacent positions. For instance, a 2 in Example 0 becomes 2 followed by 8s, which might be part of a different block.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a combination of the original row and the row below it, shifted to the right. For example, in Example 0's row 1, combining with row 4's elements shifted right. But how?\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try another approach: look for specific positions and see how they change.\n\nTake Example 0:\n\nInput row 1 (index 1) has a 2 at position 13. Output row 1 has 2 at position 13, then 8,8 at 14 and 15. Where do those 8s come from? Looking at input row 4 (index 4), which is the fifth row in the input, there's a 2 at position 5 (row 4, column 5?), followed by 8,8. So maybe the 8s from row 4 are placed after the 2 in row 1's output. The distance between row 1 and row 4 is 3 rows. So perhaps, for each number in a row, the output includes elements from three rows below, shifted right by some amount.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 3 (index 3), there's a 3 at position 15. The output row 3 has 8 (position 13), 1 (14), 3 (15). The 8 might come from row 6 (index 6) in the input, which has 8 at position 5. Again, 3 rows below, but the column shift is from 5 to 13, which is an increase of 8 columns. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is based on the value of the number. For example, a 2 would shift by 2 positions. But in Example 0, the 2 in row 1 leads to 8s two positions to the right. But 8 is the value, not the shift.\n\nAlternatively, the output for a number N in the input row i is followed by N instances of a certain number. For instance, a 2 in the input could lead to two 8s. But in Example 0's row 1, the 2 is followed by two 8s. However, in Example 2's row 10, a 4 is followed by one 3. So this might not hold.\n\nAnother idea: The output for each row is the input row, but certain numbers are replaced by sequences that \"grow\" to the right. For example, if a number is higher than the surrounding numbers, it spawns copies of itself or another number to the right. In Example 0, the 2 spawns 8s. In Example 1, 2s are preceded by 1s. In Example 2, 4 spawns a 3.\n\nAlternatively, it's about the background value. In Example 0, the background is 1. Any number higher than 1 (like 2,3,8) may cause some transformation. For instance, when a number appears, it's followed by the next higher number in the output. But 2 followed by 8 doesn't fit that.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input row 4, there's a 2 followed by 8,8. In the output row 4, this remains the same. But in the output row 1, the 2 is followed by 8,8. So perhaps the 2 in row 1 is borrowing the 8s from row 4.\n\nThis suggests that the output is combining elements from different rows, possibly offset by a certain number of rows. For example, the element in row i, column j in the input might be combined with elements from row i+3, column j+8 in the input to form the output. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a reflection or a shift of the input. For example, each row in the output is a shifted version of a lower row in the input. But in Example 0's output row 1, the 2 is followed by 8s which are present in row 4 of the input. The row difference is 3. So output row 1 is combining row 1 and row 4 of the input, with some shift.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Let's check another example.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 7 has 2s. The output row 7 has 1s followed by 2s. The 1s might come from row 3 or 4 of the input. For instance, row 3 has 1s. The row difference is 4 (from row 7 to row 3?), but not sure.\n\nThis approach is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother angle: The output seems to have more numbers than the input. Maybe each number in the input is causing a horizontal expansion. For example, each number N is replaced by N followed by N copies of another number. For instance, in Example 0's row 1, the 2 is followed by two 8s. So N=2, followed by two 8s. But why 8? Maybe 8 is a value from the same column but in a lower row. For example, in input row 4, column 5 and 6 have 8s. So if in row 1, column 13 has a 2, then maybe in the output, the next two columns (14,15) are filled with 8s from row 4's columns 5,6. But how are these columns related? 13 + something =5? That doesn't make sense. So maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, think of the numbers as representing something else, like a cellular automaton where certain numbers spread in specific directions based on rules. For example, a 2 might spread rightward as 8s, and an 8 might spread as 3s, etc. But without knowing the rules, this is hard to deduce.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input row 5 has 2 and 3. The output row 5 is the same. Then, in output row 10, the 4 from input row 10 becomes 4 followed by 3. Then row 11 has three 3s, and row 12 has 3 followed by 2. This seems like a diagonal spread down and to the right, where each number N generates N-1 in the next row's adjacent column. So 4 \u2192 3, then 3 \u2192 3s spreading, then 2.\n\nIf that's the case, then in the test input, where there's an 8 in row 4, perhaps it would generate 7s or some other numbers. But the test input's rows are filled with 3s, and some 4s, 8s, and 1s.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe test input has several rows. For example, row 4 (0-indexed?) has [3,3,3,3,3,8,4,3...]. So maybe the 8 and 4 here would generate sequences in the output. According to the pattern from Example 2, an 8 might generate 7s, but in Example 2, the 4 generated a 3. Alternatively, numbers higher than the background (3 in this case) spread downward and to the right with decreasing values.\n\nSo if the test input has an 8 in row 4, column 5 (assuming 0-indexing), then in the output, this 8 might be followed by a 7 in the same row, and then in the next row, 7s spread further, etc. Similarly, a 4 in row 4, column 6 would generate 3s.\n\nBut the test input's output needs to follow the same pattern as the training examples. Let's try to apply the pattern from Example 2 to the test input.\n\nIn Example 2's input row 10, there's a 4. In the output, this becomes 4 followed by 3. Then in the next row (11), the 3 from the previous output generates three 3s, and then row 12 has 3 followed by 2. So each number N generates N-1 to the right and down.\n\nApplying this to the test input's row 4, which has 8 and 4. The 8 would generate 7s, and the 4 would generate 3s. But in the test input's output, the 8 and 4 might be followed by 7 and 3 respectively, and those numbers would propagate down and to the right.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output rows are the same length as the input rows. So any expansion must happen within the same row length, possibly overwriting existing elements.\n\nPutting this all together, the pattern seems to be that when a number N appears in the input, it generates a sequence of numbers decreasing by 1 to the right and downward. For example, in Example 2, 4 generates 3, then 3 generates 3s and then 2. This creates a diagonal spread.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nRow 4 has 8 and 4. In the output, 8 would become 8,7, and 4 would become 4,3. Then in the rows below, these numbers would spread further.\n\nLooking at the test input's row 4: [3,3,3,3,3,8,4,3...]. The output might change this row to [3,3,3,3,3,8,7,4,3...] but considering the row length. Wait, the row length is 22 elements. So inserting more numbers might require overwriting.\n\nAlternatively, each N in the input causes the next few elements in the same row to become N-1, N-2, etc., as long as they fit within the row.\n\nIn Example 2's input row 10 has 4, which becomes 4,3. Then row 11 has three 3s, which might be from the 3 generated in row 10. Then row 12 has 3,2.\n\nSo perhaps each N in the input causes the next element to the right to be N-1, and the element below to be N-1 as well. Then those N-1s do the same.\n\nSo for the test input's row 4, the 8 would make the next element 7, and the element below (row 5) in the same column would become 7. Then in row 5, the 7 would generate 6 to the right and below.\n\nBut I need to check the test input's structure.\n\nThe test input's row 4: positions 5 and 6 are 8 and 4. Let's say in the output:\n\nRow 4: ...8,7,4,3...\n\nRow 5: ...7,6,3,2...\n\nAnd so on. But this is a hypothesis.\n\nAlso, the test input's rows 7-9 have 1s in columns 17-19. Following the pattern from Example 1, where 1s in the input are part of sequences that expand, maybe these 1s would generate 0s or other numbers, but since 1 is already low, maybe they stay.\n\nBut considering that in Example 1, the output added 1s before the 2s, maybe in the test input's rows 7-9, the 1s would generate some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, since the background in the test input is 3, any number higher than 3 would propagate, while numbers lower (like 1) might not.\n\nThis is quite complex. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that numbers N in the input generate a sequence of N-1 to the right and downward, replacing the existing elements.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFor example, in row 4, column 5 is 8. In the output, this becomes 8,7,6... to the right. However, the row length is fixed, so the 8 would be followed by 7 in column 6, then 6 in column 7, etc. But looking at the input row 4, column 6 is 4. So maybe the 4 would also generate 3 to the right.\n\nBut in the input row 4, columns 5 and 6 are 8 and 4. So in the output, column 5 becomes 8, column 6 becomes 7 (from 8-1), and the original 4 would become 4, and then column 7 would be 3 (from 4-1). But how this interacts with overlapping sequences.\n\nThis is getting complicated. To proceed, I'll assume that each number N in the input generates a rightward sequence starting with N and decrementing by 1 each step, overwriting the subsequent elements for as long as possible. So:\n\nFor the test input's row 4: [3,3,3,3,3,8,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nProcessing from left to right:\n\n- The first 8 is at position 5. The output for this row would change position 5 to 8, position 6 to 7, position 7 to 6, etc., until the end of the row or until the number reaches 0.\n\nBut the row length is 22, so starting at position 5:\n\n8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,... but this would overwrite the existing elements. However, the original input row 4 has 4 at position 6. So after processing the 8, position 6 is 7, but the 4 would also need to be processed. However, if the 8's sequence overwrites the 4, then the 4's sequence may not occur. Alternatively, maybe each number's sequence starts from its original position regardless of overlap.\n\nThis approach might not fit the training examples. For instance, in Example 2's input row 10, the 4 is followed by 3 in the output. Then in row 11, there are three 3s, suggesting that the 3 from row 10's output generated 3s below. So the vertical propagation is also a factor.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nEach number N in the input generates a diagonal spread to the right and downward, with each step decreasing by 1. So N in input row i, column j becomes N in output row i, column j. Then, in output row i, column j+1: N-1. In output row i+1, column j: N-1. And this continues for each new N-1 in the subsequent rows and columns.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow 4 has 8 at column 5. So output row 4, column 5 is 8. Column 6 becomes 7. In row 5, column 5 would be 7. Similarly, the 4 at row 4, column 6 would become 4, column 7 becomes 3. In row 5, column 6 becomes 3.\n\nBut also, in row 5 of the input, there's an 8 at column 5. So this would generate its own sequence.\n\nThis is getting too complex, but given the examples, especially Example 2, I'll try to generate the test output based on the diagonal spread pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a grid of numbers, and the output seems to modify some parts of that grid. Let's start by analyzing the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has several lines with mostly 1s and a few 2s, 3s, and 8s. The output seems to add some 8s and 3s in certain places. For instance, in the second input row, there's a 2, and in the output, the 2 is followed by two 8s. Similarly, the row that ends with a 3 in the input has an 8 before the 3 in the output. It looks like whenever there's a number that's not 1, there might be some spreading or replication of adjacent numbers. \n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has 4s as the background, with some 1s, 2s, and 6s. The output adds more 1s around the 2s and 6s. For example, the rows with 2s in the input have surrounding 1s added in the output. Maybe the pattern is that when a number (other than the background) is present, it's being expanded into adjacent cells, possibly replacing the background number. \n\nExample 2 has 8s as the background. The input has some 2s, 3s, and 4s. The output shows that numbers like 3 and 4 are creating a sort of gradient. For example, a 4 in the input is followed by a 3 and then 3s in the output. This might indicate that higher numbers are \"spreading\" lower numbers around them, creating a pattern where each number decreases by 1 as it spreads. \n\nNow, the test input has 3s as the background. There are some 4s, 8s, and 1s. Applying the pattern from the examples, perhaps any non-background number (like 4, 8, 1) would cause adjacent cells to be filled with numbers that are either one less or follow some sequence. For instance, an 8 might spread 7s or lower numbers, but in the examples, higher numbers spread lower ones. Wait, in Example 2, a 4 in the input leads to a 4 followed by a 3 in the output. Similarly, a 3 might spread 2s. \n\nLooking at the test input rows with 4s and 8s, maybe the 8 would spread 7s, but since the background is 3, maybe it's different. Alternatively, maybe each non-background number creates a cluster of numbers decreasing by 1 towards the background. For example, in the test input, where there's an 8 in a row, maybe adjacent cells become 7, 6, etc., but since the background is 3, maybe it's not possible. Hmm, perhaps the pattern is that when a number (other than the background) is present, it's surrounded by numbers that are one less, and those spread further if possible. \n\nWait, in Example 0, the 2 is followed by two 8s. The background is 1. So 2 is higher than 1, and the next numbers are 8s. But that doesn't fit the decrement pattern. Maybe it's a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the numbers form a sort of \"arrow\" or direction. Like, in Example 0, the 2 in row 1 is followed by 8s to the right. In the output, those 8s are added next to the 2. Maybe the rule is that any number higher than the background is extended to the right and/or left, creating a trail. \n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input row 4: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 8, 8, 1, 1, ...]. The output is the same. But in row 1 of the input, the 2 is followed by 1s, but in the output, the 2 is followed by 8s. That suggests that maybe the numbers after the non-background are being replaced. Or perhaps when there's a non-background number, the next few elements are filled with a certain pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each non-background number is the start of a sequence that continues in the same row. For example, in Example 0's input row 1, there's a 2. In the output, the 2 is followed by 8,8. Then the next row in the output has 8,8, then 8,1,3. Maybe it's like a diagonal spread. Or perhaps each non-background number causes a rightward expansion of the next higher number. \n\nAnother angle: in Example 1, the input has a row with 2,1,1. The output in that row is the same, but in the rows below, there's an expansion of 1s around the 2. Wait, looking at the output in Example 1, the rows with 2s and 6s have surrounding 1s added. Maybe the numbers spread in certain directions, replacing the background. For instance, a 2 in the input would cause adjacent cells (above, below, left, right) to become 1s if they were background (4). \n\nBut in Example 0's output, after the 2, there are 8s. The background is 1, so 8 is higher. That doesn't fit the spreading lower numbers. Maybe the direction of spread is different. \n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the input has a 4 in a cell, and in the output, the cell below it becomes 3, and then another 3 next to it. Like a diagonal spread. So perhaps the rule is that a number N in the input causes the cell below and to the right to become N-1, creating a diagonal pattern. \n\nTesting this hypothesis: In Example 2's input, row 10 has a 4. In the output row 10, it's followed by 4,3. Then in the next row (11), the 4 becomes 3, and then 3,3,3. Then row 12 has 8,3,2. So maybe it's a diagonal down-right spread, decreasing by 1 each step. \n\nIf that's the case, then in the test input, where there's an 8 in row 4, column 6 (assuming 0-based or 1-based indexing), maybe that 8 would cause the cells below and to the right to become 7, then 6, etc. But the background here is 3, so perhaps the 8 would start a sequence of 8,7,6,5,4,3 as it spreads. But the test input's background is 3, so maybe the numbers would decrease until they hit 3. \n\nLooking at the test input row 4: [3,3,3,3,3,3,8,4,3,3,...]. The output might change the 8 and 4 into sequences. The 8 could spread 7 to the right and below, and the 4 would spread 3. \n\nBut the test input also has rows with 4s grouped. For example, rows 1-3 have 4s in columns 10-12. Maybe those 4s would spread 3s to the surrounding cells. \n\nAnother thing to note is that in the training examples, the output often creates a diamond or block pattern around non-background numbers. For instance, in Example 1, the 2s and 6s are surrounded by 1s. So maybe any non-background number is surrounded by a layer of the next lower number. \n\nPutting this together, the pattern might be: For each non-background number N in the input, replace the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, diagonals?) with N-1, provided those cells are background. Then, for those new N-1 cells, do the same, decrementing until reaching the background number. \n\nBut in Example 0, the 2 is followed by 8s, which are higher than the background 1. That contradicts the decrement idea. Hmm. Maybe it's a different approach. \n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input row 1: [1,1,1,...2,1...]. Output row 1: [...2,8,8]. Output row 2: [...8,8,1]. So the 2 in row 1 is followed by two 8s in the same row. The next row has 8,8, then 8,1. Maybe the numbers are being transformed into a different sequence. Maybe it's a rotation or some kind of shift. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being replaced by the sum of adjacent cells. But that seems less likely. \n\nAnother angle: in Example 0, the output seems to have clusters of 8s where the input had 2s and 3s. Maybe each number other than the background (1) is replaced by a specific pattern. For example, 2 becomes 8, and 3 becomes 3. But that doesn't explain the spread. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a cellular automaton where certain numbers act as seeds that generate patterns. For example, a 2 generates a 2x2 block of 8s to the right. Then those 8s generate more blocks. But looking at Example 0's output, the 2 in row 1 leads to two 8s next to it. The 3 in row 3's input is followed by 8 and then 3. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a common rule across all examples. \n\nIn all examples, the background number is the one that's most prevalent. The other numbers are transformed in the output. For instance:\n\n- Example 0: background 1. Numbers 2,3,8. Output adds 8s around 2 and 3.\n- Example 1: background 4. Numbers 1,2,6. Output adds 1s around 2 and 6.\n- Example 2: background 8. Numbers 2,3,4. Output adds 3s around 4, 2s around 3, etc.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that each non-background number N is surrounded by a block of (N-1) or (N+1) in certain directions. But how?\n\nIn Example 0, 2 is followed by 8s. 8 is higher than 2, so maybe it's N multiplied by something. 2*4=8. That could fit. Then 3* something? The third example's input has 3 and the output has 3. Maybe 3 is kept as is, but 2 becomes 8. \n\nBut then in Example 2, a 4 in the input leads to 3s in the output (4-1=3). That fits. The 3s in the input become 2s (3-1=2), and the 2 becomes 1 (but in Example 2's output, the 2 in the input is followed by 3, which doesn't fit). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps non-background numbers spread to the right and down. For example, a 2 in the input would create a 2 in the same cell, and then 8s to the right and below. But why 8?\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are being replaced with their squares modulo some base. For example, 2 squared is 4, but in the output it's 8. Maybe 2 cubed? 2^3=8. 3^3=27, which mod something isn't matching. Alternatively, 2 multiplied by 4 (the position?), but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, each non-background number N is replaced by 2^(N+1). For N=2, 2^3=8. For N=3, 2^4=16, which doesn't fit. But in Example 0, the 3 remains 3. So that might not work.\n\nAnother thought: the numbers form a pattern where each non-background number is part of a shape that's expanded in the output. For example, a 2 in the input might be the top-left corner of a 2x2 block of 8s. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, looking for a directional spread. For example, in Example 0's output, the 2 is followed by two 8s to the right. The next row has the 8s shifted left by one. Then the next row has one 8 followed by a 3. This looks like a diagonal pattern moving down and to the right.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2's input, a 4 in row 10 leads to a 4, then 3, then 3 in the rows below. So maybe each non-background number N creates a diagonal trail of N-1 downwards and to the right.\n\nApplying that to the test input, where there's an 8 in row 4, column 6 (assuming 0-based), this would create a diagonal of 7,6,5,... downwards and to the right until hitting the background 3. Let's see:\n\nOriginal cell (4,6) is 8. Then (5,7) becomes 7, (6,8) becomes 6, etc., each step decreasing by 1. Similarly, the 4 in row 4, column 7 would become 4, then 3 in (5,8), etc.\n\nBut in the test input, there's also a row with 1,8,3. Applying this rule, the 8 would start a diagonal of 7,6,5, etc. But the background is 3, so 7 would be 7-3=4 steps, but maybe the numbers stop at 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spread is not diagonal but to the right and down. For example, each non-background N in (i,j) creates N-1 in (i,j+1) and (i+1,j). Let's test this with Example 0:\n\nInput row 1 has a 2 at position 13. Output row 1 has 2 at 13, then 8,8 at 14,15. If N=2, then j+1 and i+1 positions would have 2-1=1. That doesn't fit. Wait, but the output has 8s. So maybe it's adding N*4. 2*4=8. If that's the case, then 3*4=12, but in Example 0's row 3, a 3 in the input becomes a 3 in the output. So that might not work.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's try a different approach. Compare the input and output grids cell by cell to see what changes.\n\nIn Example 0, the first row in input is all 1s, output is same. Second input row has a 2 in position 13. Output row has 2 followed by two 8s. Third input row is all 1s except position 13 is 1. Output row has 8,8 in positions 13-14. Wait, how does that happen? The third input row is the same as the first, but the output row is different. So it's not just the current row's input affecting the output. It must be considering surrounding rows.\n\nLooking at the third input row (index 2), which is all 1s except position 15 has a 3. The output for this row is [1,1,...1,8,1,3,1...]. So the 3 in the input's row 3 (index 3) has an 8 before it in the output. Maybe there's an upward or downward influence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the cells in the input and, for each cell that is not the background, creating a shape around it. For example, a 2 in the input could create a 2x2 block of 8s to the right. Then, in the next row, that block shifts left and continues.\n\nAlternatively, it's a convolution where each non-background cell is replaced by a certain kernel. For example, a 2 in the input could generate a 3x3 area of 8s centered on itself. But in Example 0, the 2 is in position 13 of row 1. The output row 1 has 2 followed by two 8s. Then row 2 has two 8s shifted left. Maybe it's a diagonal kernel.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each number N in the input creates a rightward and downward arrow of N*4. For example, 2*4=8, so 2 becomes 8s to the right and down. But this is speculative.\n\nLooking at the test input, there's an 8 in row 4, column 6. If the rule is to replace 8 with 8, then create 7s to the right and down, then 6s, etc., until reaching 3. So row 4, column 6: 8 \u2192 remains 8. Row 5, column 7: 7. Row 6, column 8: 6. Row 7, column 9: 5. Row 8, column 10:4. Row 9, column 11:3. Beyond that, since the background is 3, it stops. Similarly, the 4 in row 4, column 7 would become 3 in row 5, column 8, and so on.\n\nBut in Example 2, a 4 in the input leads to a 4 in the same cell and a 3 below and to the right. So maybe that's the case.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the 8 and 4 in row 4 would create a diagonal trail decreasing by 1 each step. So the output for row 4 would have 8,4, and then row 5 would have 7,3, etc.\n\nBut let's check the other parts of the test input. For example, the rows with 4s in columns 10-12. Each 4 would become 3 in the cells to the right and below. So in the output, those 4s would have 3s around them.\n\nAdditionally, the test input has rows with 1s. The background is 3. So 1 is lower than 3. Maybe the 1s spread 2s around them. But in Example 0, the background is 1, and 2s spread 8s. So the rule might be different when the non-background number is higher or lower than the background.\n\nAlternatively, maybe non-background numbers create a diamond-shaped area around them where each layer is one less than the previous. For example, a 4 would create a diamond with 4 in the center, 3 around it, then 2, then 1, until reaching the background. But the background here is 3, so a 4 would have a layer of 3 around it.\n\nIn the test input's row 7-9, there are 1s in columns 17-19. Since the background is 3, the 1s are lower. So maybe they spread 2s around them. But in the output, perhaps those 1s are surrounded by 2s.\n\nPutting all this together, the final answer for the test input would involve:\n\n- For each 8 in the input, create a diagonal trail of 7,6,5,4,3 to the right and down.\n- For each 4, create a trail of 3s.\n- For each 1, create a trail of 2s, but since the background is 3, those 2s would be visible.\n- The clusters of 4s in rows 1-3 would spread 3s around them.\n- The 8 in row 4 would spread 7,6,5,4,3 diagonally.\n- The 1s in rows 7-9 would spread 2s around them.\n\nBut let's see how this applies to the test input. Let's take the row where there's an 8 and 4:\n\nInput row 4: [3,3,3,3,3,3,8,4,3,3...]\n\nOutput row 4 might be [3,3,3,3,3,3,8,4,3,3...] (same as input for the first part), but in row 5, the 8 would lead to a 7 in the next position. So row 5: [3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3...] would become [3,3,3,3,3,8,7,4,3,3...]. Wait, maybe not. The 8 in row 4, column 6 (if columns are 0-based) would affect row 5, column 7 (7=6+1) to be 7, and row 5, column 6 (same row) to have 7? Or diagonally.\n\nAlternatively, each non-background number N creates a cell to the right and below with N-1. So for the 8 in (4,6), the cell to the right (4,7) would become 7, and the cell below (5,6) would become 7. But the input cell (4,7) is 4. So maybe the rule is to overwrite the background cells (3) but leave other non-background numbers as is. So if the cell to the right is 4 (non-background), it stays, but if it's background, it becomes N-1.\n\nThis is getting quite complex, but based on the examples, the output for the test input would have trails of decreasing numbers from the non-background elements. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to generate the test output based on the observed patterns. For each non-background number (3 is background), numbers like 8,4,1 will spread their values decreasing by 1 to the right and below, replacing background 3s. So:\n\n- The 8 in row 4, column 6 would create 7 in row 5, column 7; 6 in row 6, column 8; 5 in row 7, column 9; 4 in row 8, column 10; 3 in row 9, column 11.\n- The 4 in row 4, column 7 would create 3 in row 5, column 8; then 2 in row 6, column 9 (but since background is 3, 2 is lower and might not show? Or maybe it's allowed.\n- The 1 in row 6, column 5 would create 0, but since the background is 3, maybe it's not shown. But in the examples, 1s spread 1s or other numbers. Hmm, maybe 1s spread 0s, but since 0 isn't part of the background, perhaps they are not displayed. This is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spread stops when the value reaches the background number. So 8 would spread down and right until the value equals 3.\n\nGiven the complexity, the safest bet is to look for the closest pattern from the examples. In Example 2, the 4 in the input leads to a 3 below and to the right. Similarly, the 3 leads to 2s. \n\nApplying that to the test input:\n\nThe 8 would become 7 in the next row and column, then 6, etc., until 3. The 4 would become 3, then 2, then 1. The 1s would become 0, but since the background is 3, maybe they're not changed. \n\nHowever, looking at the test input's rows with 1s in columns 17-19 (rows 7-9), the output might have those 1s surrounded by 0s, but since 0 isn't part of the background, perhaps they're left as 3. But in Example 1, 1s spread to 1s in the output. \n\nThis is quite challenging. Given the time, I'll proceed to draft the output based on these observations, hoping that the pattern is to spread each non-background number to the right and down, decreasing by 1 each step, replacing background cells.",
