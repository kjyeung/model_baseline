        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has several rows with all zeros, and some rows with all the same number. The output is a list of sequences from those non-zero rows, but each entry in the output is a list of that number repeated multiple times. For instance, the third row in the input is all 2s, and the first output line is [2,2,2,2,2,2]. Similarly, the sixth row is all 1s, so the next output line is [1,1,1,1,1,1]. But wait, the output lines don't all have the same length. Let me check: the input rows with non-zero numbers have varying lengths. Wait, the input rows are all 15 elements long. The output entries for Example 0 have lengths of 6 elements each. Hmm. Let me count. For example, the row with 2s is 15 elements, and the output for that is 6 2s. But how does that relate?\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is about the number of elements in each non-zero row. But the output in Example 0 has 6 elements for each line, but the input rows have 15. Maybe there's a different approach. Looking at Example 1's input: there are rows with numbers like 5,5,5,0, etc. The output is [1,2,4] repeated three times. Wait, the input has columns where certain numbers appear. Let's check if the output is taking the non-zero numbers from each column, but maybe vertically.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 1's input. Let's list the input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,4,0]\nRow 1: [0,5,5,5,0,2,0,0,4,0]\nRow 2: [0,5,5,5,0,2,0,0,4,0]\nRow 3: [0,5,5,5,0,2,0,0,4,0]\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,4,0]\nThen rows 5-11 have 1s in the third column, 2s in the sixth, and 4s in the ninth.\n\nThe output is three lines of [1,2,4]. So maybe each line in the output corresponds to the distinct non-zero numbers in each column, but only for columns that have non-zero numbers in multiple consecutive rows. Wait, but how are the output lines formed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sequence of numbers found in the middle of \"blocks\" of non-zero numbers. For instance, in Example 0, the non-zero rows are 2, then 1, 3, 5 (but in row 10 and 11), then 4, then 8, then 6. The output lists them in order, each as a list of the same number repeated. So maybe the output is all the non-zero rows, but each represented as a list of their number repeated the number of times equal to the length of their non-zero block. Wait, in Example 0's input row 2 has 15 2s, but the output for that is 6 2s. Hmm, that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the numbers that appear in the middle of the input when you look at vertical sequences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking each horizontal block of the same number (ignoring zeros) and listing those numbers in the order they appear vertically. But in Example 0, there are several rows with all the same number. The output lists each of these numbers once per their occurrence. Wait, the output for Example 0 is 6 entries each of the numbers 2,1,3,4,8,6. Each entry is a list of the number repeated six times. But why six? The input rows with 2s are 15 elements, but the output for 2 is 6 elements. Maybe the number of times the number is repeated in the output corresponds to the number of times the number appears in the input rows. Wait, in Example 0, the 2s appear once (row 2), 1s once (row5), 3s once (row8), etc. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, let's look at the test input. The test input has rows with numbers like 2,5,3,5,8,4,6,1,7. The output needs to be in the format of the training examples. Let's think of each example's output structure.\n\nIn Example 0's output, each line is a list of a single number repeated six times. The numbers in the output are 2,1,3,4,8,6. These correspond to the non-zero rows in the input (row 2: all 2s, row5: 1s, row8:3s, row11:4s, row14:8s, row17:6s). Each of these rows is a solid block of the same number. So the output for Example0 is taking each of these rows and representing them as a list of the number repeated six times. But why six? The original rows have 15 elements. 15 divided by something? 15 elements, but output is 6 elements. Maybe 6 is the number of columns where the non-zero starts? Or maybe it's the number of elements in the non-zero block. Wait, in Example0's input, the 2s are 15 elements. But output is 6 2s. That doesn't fit. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nLooking at Example1's output: the output is three lines of [1,2,4]. The input has columns where certain numbers are present. For example, in column 2 (if 0-based?), perhaps there are 1s, in column 5 (maybe) there are 2s, and column 8 has 4s. So for each column that has a consistent non-zero number across multiple rows, the output takes those numbers in order. For example, the columns that have 1,2,4 in vertical lines would be grouped into a list. Then each line in the output corresponds to a set of columns with those numbers. But in Example1's output, each line is the same. So maybe each vertical triplet is [1,2,4] and they appear three times in the output. Wait, but the output has three lines. Maybe each line corresponds to a group of columns that have those numbers. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: maybe each output line represents a horizontal \"segment\" of non-zero numbers. For example, in Example0's input, row2 is all 2s. The output starts with six 2s. Then row5 is all 1s: next line is six 1s. Then row8 is all 3s, etc. So maybe each non-zero row is converted into a line in the output, but the length of the output line is the number of elements in the input row divided by some factor. For 15 elements, 15 divided by 2.5 gives 6. That seems arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe the output lists each non-zero row's value once for each occurrence in the row, but only taking the first six elements? But in Example0's input row2 is 15 2s, output is 6 2s. 15 is 15 elements, 6 is 6. Maybe the output is taking the count of the number in the row and then creating a list of that many elements. Wait, row2 in example0 has 15 2s. Output is 6 2s. 15 and 6 aren't directly related. Alternatively, maybe the output is grouping the numbers by their occurrence in columns. For example, the first output line in Example0 is [2,2,2,2,2,2], which could correspond to the first six columns of row2 (all 2s). But then why not the rest? Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example2's input and output. Input rows have varying numbers. The output is:\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n[8,8,8,8]\n[4,4,4,4]\n[1,1,1,1]\n\nLooking at the input, the rows with non-zero numbers:\n\nRow1: [2,2,2,2,2,0,5,5,5,5,0,2]\nRow4: [8,8,8,8,8,0,5,5,5,5,0,8]\nRow7: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\nRow10: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nThe output has lines with 2s (4 times), 8s (4 times), 4s (4 times), 1s (4 times). The input rows have 5 2s in row1, but the output for 2s is 4. So maybe the output is taking the first N elements of each non-zero row, where N is the number of elements before a zero. For example, in row1 of Example2's input: [2,2,2,2,2,0,...]. The first five elements are 2s, but the output is four. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the output lines are the number repeated as many times as the maximum consecutive sequence in their row. For example, row1 has 5 consecutive 2s, but output is 4. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is capturing the numbers from the middle sections of the rows. For example, in Example0's row10: [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output includes 5s in the output, but in Example0's output, there's no 5s. Wait, no. The output of Example0 includes 2,1,3,4,8,6. So the rows that are entirely filled with a single non-zero number are the ones in the output. But in Example0, rows 2,5,8,11 (row indices start at 0?), 14,17. Those rows are all filled with a single number. So the output lists each of those numbers, each as a list of that number repeated six times. Wait, but why six? Maybe the number of zeros in between? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking each such full row (all same non-zero) and representing it as a list of the number repeated the number of times equal to the number of such rows. But in Example0, there are six such rows (2,1,3,4,8,6), each output line is six elements. So 6 lines each with six elements. Hmm, the count of rows is 6, and each line has 6 elements. So maybe each output line is the number repeated as many times as there are such rows. But in Example0's output, each line is six elements, which matches the number of lines (6 lines). So each line's length is equal to the total number of such non-zero rows. That's a possible pattern. Let's check the other examples.\n\nExample1's output has three lines, each line is [1,2,4]. Each line has three elements. The number of lines is 3, and each element is three. So perhaps the number of elements per line is equal to the number of lines. In this case, 3 elements per line, 3 lines. Similarly, in Example2's output, there are four lines, each line has four elements. So the pattern seems to be that each output line is a list of a single number repeated as many times as there are such lines in the output. For example, in Example0, there are six lines, each line has six elements. Example1 has three lines, each line has three elements. Example2 has four lines, each line has four elements. So the output lines are all of the same length, and that length is equal to the number of lines in the output. Each line corresponds to a row in the input that is entirely filled with a single non-zero number, and the output line is that number repeated as many times as there are such rows. So the number of output lines is the count of such rows, and each line is that number repeated that count times.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nExample0's input has rows with all non-zero numbers:\n\nRow 2: all 2s\n\nRow5: all 1s\n\nRow8: all 3s\n\nRow11: 4s (but looking back at Example0's input, row 11 is [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. Wait, no, that's not all 4s. So maybe my previous assumption is incorrect. Oh wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's re-examine Example0's input.\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nLooking at the input structure:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2] \u2192 all 2s.\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] \u2192 all 1s.\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] \u2192 all 3s.\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 not all 5s.\n\nRow11: [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] \u2192 starts with 0, then 5s, then 0, then 4s.\n\nWait, so rows 2,5,8,17 (the sixth row in the input is index 5?), row5 is 1s, row8 is 3s. Then row17 is 6s. The output of Example0 has six lines: 2,1,3,4,8,6. But where do 4,8 come from? Looking at the input:\n\nRow11 is part of the input. The row is [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. So that row isn't all 4s. So how does the 4 get into the output? Similarly, row14 is [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. Again, starts with 0 and 5s, then 8s. So maybe the output is capturing the non-zero sequences from each row, even if they are not the entire row. For example, in row11, the 4s are in positions 8-14 (assuming 0-based). So that's a block of 7 4s. Similarly, row14 has a block of 7 8s. So perhaps the output is collecting all the blocks of non-zero numbers from the input, ordered by their occurrence, and each block is represented as a list of the number repeated the number of times equal to the number of such blocks. \n\nWait, in Example0's output, there are six lines. Let's count the blocks:\n\nRow2: 15 2s \u2192 one block.\n\nRow5: 15 1s \u2192 one block.\n\nRow8: 15 3s \u2192 one block.\n\nRow11 has two blocks: 6 5s and 7 4s. But in the output, the 4s are present. Similarly, row14 has two blocks: 6 5s and 7 8s. So the output includes 4 and 8. And row17 has 15 6s. So the total blocks would be:\n\nRow2 \u2192 2s.\n\nRow5 \u21921s.\n\nRow8 \u21923s.\n\nRow11 \u21924s.\n\nRow14 \u21928s.\n\nRow17 \u21926s.\n\nThat's six blocks. So each block is a contiguous sequence of the same non-zero number in a row, and each such block is represented as a line in the output. Each line is the number repeated as many times as there are such blocks. Since there are six blocks, each line is six elements. So 2 repeated six times, 1 six times, etc.\n\nIf that's the case, then the pattern is:\n\n1. For each contiguous block of the same non-zero number in any row (regardless of their position), collect them in order of their appearance in the input.\n\n2. For each collected number, create a line in the output where the number is repeated N times, where N is the total number of such blocks.\n\nSo in Example0, there are six blocks (2s, 1s, 3s,4s,8s,6s), so each output line has six elements.\n\nIn Example1, the input has blocks:\n\nLooking at Example1's input:\n\nRow0: 2s (position5), 4s (position8). So two blocks.\n\nRows1-3: 5s (positions1-3), 2s (pos5), 4s (pos8). Each row has three blocks (5s, 2s,4s). But maybe considering that across rows. Alternatively, perhaps each column that has a non-zero number throughout some consecutive rows.\n\nBut Example1's output is three lines of [1,2,4]. Each line has three elements. So according to the previous hypothesis, the number of blocks would be three. But where do 1,2,4 come from.\n\nWait, in Example1's input, the 1s are in column2, rows5-11. So that's a vertical block of 7 rows. The 2s are in column5, rows0-11 (all 12 rows have 2 in column5). The 4s are in column8, rows0-11. So each of these is a vertical column filled with the same number. So perhaps the output is taking each column that is entirely filled with the same non-zero number (excluding zeros) and creating a line for each such column, and the line consists of the numbers from these columns, each repeated the number of such columns.\n\nExample1's output has three elements per line, three lines. So three columns (1,2,4) that are non-zero. So each line in the output is the numbers from these columns, each repeated three times. But the output lines are [1,2,4], three times. So maybe the output is listing the distinct column numbers that are filled non-zero, sorted in some order, and each line represents a row, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the numbers that appear in vertical columns of the input. So if a column has the same non-zero number in all non-zero rows, then that number is part of the output. Each output line corresponds to a vertical group of such columns, and the line lists those numbers in order. But how are the lines formed?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output lists each unique non-zero number in the input, sorted, and each line is that number repeated the number of times equal to the number of times that number appears in blocks. But in Example0, the output has six different numbers, each appearing once. So each line has six repetitions.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern might involve grouping the input into vertical columns and looking for contiguous non-zero numbers in those columns. For example, if a column has a sequence of non-zero numbers (same number), that's considered a block, and each such block contributes to the output.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at Example0's output: each line is a sequence of the same number, and the numbers are ordered as 2,1,3,4,8,6. The order corresponds to the order of the rows in the input where the blocks appear. So row2 (2s) comes first, then row5 (1s), then row8 (3s), row11's 4s (appear next), row14's 8s, and row17's 6s. So the output lists the numbers in the order they first appear in the input. Each output line has the number repeated as many times as the number of such blocks.\n\nIn Example0, six blocks, so six elements per line.\n\nExample1's output: three lines of [1,2,4]. So the blocks are three (1,2,4). Each line has three elements. So each number is repeated three times. The numbers are ordered as 1,2,4. How do these appear in the input? The 1s are in column2 starting from row5. The 2s are in column5 from row0. The 4s are in column8 from row0. So the order might be based on when the column starts. 2s start at row0, 4s start at row0, but in column8. So maybe the order is based on column index. Columns 5 (2), column2 (1), column8 (4). But the output is [1,2,4]. Hmm, perhaps sorted numerically. 1,2,4.\n\nBut Example1's output has three lines. Each line is [1,2,4], which are three elements. So three elements per line. The number of lines equals the number of rows in the output. Wait, the input has 12 rows. The output has three lines. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is the minimal list of numbers that form vertical lines in the input. For example, in Example1, columns 2,5,8 have 1,2,4 respectively throughout all rows. So each output line represents one of these vertical columns, but the line is [1,2,4] repeated three times. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the numbers that appear in vertical columns, and each line in the output represents a row in the input. For example, in Example1, each output line corresponds to a row in the input, but only the numbers that are present in that row's columns. But the output lines are all the same. So perhaps each line in the output represents the vertical columns' numbers, and the number of lines is the number of such columns. But in Example1's case, there are three columns (1,2,4), so three lines, each listing all three numbers. But why three elements per line?\n\nAlternatively, the output is the distinct numbers found in the vertical columns, sorted, and each line represents the same set. But why three lines?\n\nWait, the output for Example1 is three lines of [1,2,4]. The input has 12 rows. The columns with 1,2,4 are all present from row5 to row11. So perhaps the output lines correspond to the number of rows in the vertical columns. For example, the 1s are present in 7 rows (rows5-11), so each output line is one for each such row. But the output has three lines, which doesn't match 7. So that's not it.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to focus on the test input and see if I can apply possible patterns.\n\nThe test input has multiple rows. Let's list them and look for non-zero blocks.\n\nTest Input rows:\n\nRow0: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]\n\nSo non-zero blocks here are: seven 2s, then after zeros, three 2s. So two blocks of 2s in this row.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nOne block of seven 5s.\n\nRow2: same as row1.\n\nRow3: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,3,3,3]\n\nThree blocks: seven 3s, then seven 5s, then three 3s.\n\nRow4: same as row1.\n\nRow5: same as row1.\n\nRow6: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,8,8,8]\n\nThree blocks: seven 8s, seven 5s, three 8s.\n\nRow7: same as row1.\n\nRow8: all zeros.\n\nRow9: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] \u2192 all 4s. One block.\n\nRow10: all zeros.\n\nRow11: all zeros.\n\nRow12: [6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6] \u2192 all 6s. One block.\n\nRow13-14: all zeros.\n\nRow15: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] \u2192 all 1s. One block.\n\nRow16-17: zeros.\n\nRow18: [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7] \u2192 all 7s. One block.\n\nSo the blocks are:\n\nFrom row0: two blocks of 2s (7 and 3).\n\nRow1: one block of 5s (7).\n\nRow2: same as row1.\n\nRow3: three blocks (3s,5s,3s).\n\nRow4: same as row1.\n\nRow5: same as row1.\n\nRow6: three blocks (8s,5s,8s).\n\nRow7: same as row1.\n\nRow9: one block of 4s.\n\nRow12: one block of 6s.\n\nRow15: one block of 1s.\n\nRow18: one block of7s.\n\nSo the total blocks would be:\n\nRow0: 2 (2s), 2 (2s)\n\nRow1: 5 (5s)\n\nRow2: 5 (5s)\n\nRow3:3 (3s),5 (5s),3 (3s)\n\nRow4:5 (5s)\n\nRow5:5 (5s)\n\nRow6:8 (8s),5 (5s),8 (8s)\n\nRow7:5 (5s)\n\nRow9:4 (4s)\n\nRow12:6 (6s)\n\nRow15:1 (1s)\n\nRow18:7 (7s)\n\nBut wait, each block is a contiguous sequence of the same number in a row. So for example, in row0: the first seven 2s are a block, then three 2s at the end are another block. So that's two blocks of 2s. Similarly, row3 has two blocks of 3s and one block of 5s. Etc.\n\nNow, the pattern from the examples seems to collect all such blocks and represent each as a line in the output. The line is the number repeated as many times as the total number of such blocks. For example, in Example0, there are six blocks, so each line has six elements. In Example1, the output lines have three elements, implying three blocks. Let's check Example1.\n\nExample1's input:\n\nRows have columns with numbers. For instance, column2 (0-based) has 1s in rows5-11. Column5 has 2s in rows0-11. Column8 has 4s in rows0-11. So these three columns each have a vertical block of the same number. So three blocks, hence each line in the output has three elements, and the output has three lines. Each line is [1,2,4], which are the numbers from the vertical columns. So maybe the output is capturing vertical columns that are filled with the same non-zero number, and each line in the output corresponds to such a column. Each line's elements are the numbers from these columns, and each line has as many elements as there are such columns. But in Example1's output, each line is [1,2,4], three elements, three lines, but why three lines? Because there are three columns. So each line represents a row, and in each row, these columns have the same values. Hence, three lines, each showing the three column values. So for example, row5 has 1,2,4; row6 same; etc. Hence, the output is three lines of [1,2,4], each line representing a row in the input where these vertical columns have their values.\n\nBut wait, in Example1's input, the columns with 1,2,4 are present in rows5-11. So seven rows. But the output has three lines. That doesn't match. So perhaps the output is taking the vertical columns and each line represents the numbers in those columns, but the number of lines equals the number of such vertical columns. But in Example1, three vertical columns, so three lines. But the output has three lines of three elements each. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is transposed. For vertical columns with non-zero numbers, each such column becomes a line in the output, which is the number repeated the number of times equal to the number of such columns.\n\nIn Example1, three columns (1,2,4), so each line is three elements. Each line is the number of the column repeated three times. But the output has three lines of [1,2,4], which doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nIn the test input, the blocks are:\n\nLet's list all the blocks:\n\nRow0: two blocks of 2s (7,3)\n\nRow1: 5s (7)\n\nRow2: 5s (7)\n\nRow3: 3s (7), 5s (7), 3s (3)\n\nRow4: 5s (7)\n\nRow5: 5s (7)\n\nRow6: 8s (7), 5s (7), 8s (3)\n\nRow7: 5s (7)\n\nRow9: 4s (19)\n\nRow12: 6s (19)\n\nRow15: 1s (19)\n\nRow18:7s (19)\n\nSo the numbers in the blocks are: 2,2,5,5,3,5,3,5,5,8,5,8,5,4,6,1,7.\n\nBut how does this relate to the output? The output from the examples seems to list each unique number once per line, but in the training examples, it's not the case. Wait, in Example0's output, each line is a unique number. In Example1, each line is three numbers. So perhaps the pattern is different between the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the numbers from the non-zero rows that are completely filled with the same number, ordered from top to bottom. Each such row becomes a line in the output, with the number repeated as many times as the number of such rows. For example, in Example0, there are six such rows (2,1,3,4,8,6), so each line has six elements. Let's check the test input:\n\nLooking for rows that are completely filled with a single non-zero number.\n\nRow9: all 4s.\n\nRow12: all 6s.\n\nRow15: all 1s.\n\nRow18: all 7s.\n\nSo these four rows are completely filled with non-zero numbers. So according to this pattern, the output should have four lines, each line being the number repeated four times. So 4,6,1,7. Each line has four elements. So the output would be:\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[6,6,6,6]\n\n[1,1,1,1]\n\n[7,7,7,7]\n\nBut wait, looking at the training examples:\n\nExample0's output includes 4, which comes from row11's 4s. But row11 isn't completely filled with 4s. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nSo back to square one. Let's think again.\n\nAlternative approach: For each example, the output lines are the numbers from the non-zero rows, but only the first occurrence of each number. And each line's length is the number of such rows.\n\nExample0 has six non-zero rows, so each line is six elements. Each line is a different number. Example1's output has three lines, each with three elements. The numbers are 1,2,4. So three unique numbers, and three lines. Example2's output has four lines, each four elements.\n\nWait, the output for Example2 is:\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[8,8,8,8]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[1,1,1,1]\n\nEach line has four elements, four lines. The numbers are 2,8,4,1. Looking at the input for Example2:\n\nRow1: 2,2,2,2,2,0,5,5,5,5,0,2 \u2192 not all 2s.\n\nRow4:8,8,8,8,8,0,5,5,5,5,0,8 \u2192 not all 8s.\n\nRow7:4s all.\n\nRow10:1s all.\n\nSo the output includes 2,8,4,1. So perhaps the rows that have their entire row filled are 4 and 1. But the output includes 2 and8. So maybe the output includes any row that has a block of non-zero numbers, even if it's not the entire row. But then how to select which blocks to include?\n\nAlternatively, the output is capturing the first occurrence of each number in the input, and each line is that number repeated as many times as the number of unique numbers. For Example0, six unique numbers, each line six elements. Example1, three unique numbers, each line three elements. Example2, four unique numbers, four elements per line. Test input has four unique numbers (4,6,1,7) but also others like 2,3,5,8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output lines are formed by the numbers that appear in the input in the same order as their first occurrence, and each line is the number repeated the number of times equal to the number of output lines. For Example0, six lines, each line six elements. Test input would need to have six lines, but according to previous analysis, there are four rows with all non-zero numbers. So this may not fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me look at the examples again.\n\nExample0's input has some rows with all non-zero numbers, and others with partial. The output captures numbers from both types of rows. For example, 4 is from row11's 4s. So perhaps any contiguous block of the same non-zero number is considered, and each such block is represented as a line in the output. The line consists of the number repeated as many times as the total number of such blocks.\n\nIn Example0, there are six blocks (from the rows I identified earlier), so each line is six elements. Each block is represented once. So the output lines are ordered as the blocks appear in the input.\n\nIn Example1, how many blocks are there? Let's count:\n\nLooking at Example1's input, each row has:\n\nRow0: 2 and 4.\n\nRow1:5,2,4.\n\nRow2:5,2,4.\n\nRow3:5,2,4.\n\nRow4:2,4.\n\nRow5:1,2,4.\n\nRow6:1,2,4.\n\n... up to row11.\n\nSo each row has multiple blocks. But the output is three lines of [1,2,4]. So perhaps the output is capturing vertical columns that have the same number throughout, and each line corresponds to a vertical column. So in Example1, columns 2,5,8 have 1,2,4 throughout all rows where they appear. Each such vertical column is a line in the output, represented as the number repeated three times (since there are three columns). But the output lines are [1,2,4], which would suggest that each line is the list of column numbers. But why three lines?\n\nAlternatively, each vertical column with non-zero numbers becomes a line, and the line is the number repeated the number of columns. But in Example1, three columns, so three lines. Each line is the column's number repeated three times. So for column2 (1), line is [1,1,1]; column5 (2), [2,2,2]; column8 (4), [4,4,4]. But Example1's output is three lines of [1,2,4]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let me try to apply this hypothesis to the test input.\n\nTest input has vertical columns:\n\nLooking for columns that are entirely filled with the same non-zero number. For example:\n\n- Column0: in row0 is 2, row1-7 are 0, row9 is 4, row12 is6, row15 is1, row18 is7. So no column is filled with the same number.\n\n- Column8: in row0 is 0, row1-7 are5, row9 is4, etc. So not filled.\n\nSo perhaps there are no columns that are filled with the same number. So according to Example1's pattern, maybe no lines. But the test input has rows filled with numbers. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nBack to Example0 and Example2:\n\nExample0's output includes numbers from both full rows and partial rows. So perhaps the pattern is to collect all the contiguous non-zero blocks in the input (regardless of being full row or not), and list each block's number in the order they appear. Each line in the output corresponds to a block, and the line is the number repeated the number of times equal to the total number of such blocks.\n\nIn Example0, there are six blocks (2,1,3,4,8,6), so each line is six elements. For example, the first block (2s) becomes [2,2,2,2,2,2], and so on.\n\nIn Example1, how many blocks are there? Let's count:\n\nIn Example1's input, each row has:\n\nRow0: two blocks (2 and4).\n\nRow1: three blocks (5,2,4).\n\nRow2: same as row1.\n\nRow3: same.\n\nRow4: two blocks (2,4).\n\nRows5-11: three blocks each (1,2,4).\n\nTotal blocks:\n\nRow0: 2\n\nRow1:3 \u00d7 3 rows (rows1-3) \u2192 3\u00d73=9?\n\nWait, this approach might not be feasible. Let's instead count all contiguous non-zero blocks in Example1's input:\n\nEach row:\n\nRow0: two blocks (positions5:2, position8:4).\n\nRow1: positions1-3:5, position5:2, position8:4.\n\nRow2: same.\n\nRow3: same.\n\nRow4: positions5:2, position8:4.\n\nRow5: position2:1, position5:2, position8:4.\n\nRows6-11: same as row5.\n\nSo for each row, the number of blocks:\n\nRow0:2\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:3\n\nRow3:3\n\nRow4:2\n\nRow5:3\n\nRow6:3\n\nRow7:3\n\nRow8:3\n\nRow9:3\n\nRow10:3\n\nRow11:3\n\nTotal blocks: 2 + 3\u00d710 + 2 = 2+30+2=34. So according to this hypothesis, the output would have 34 lines. But the actual output has three lines. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: looking at the outputs of the examples, the output for Example0 is 6 lines, each of 6 elements. The elements are the same number in each line. The numbers are ordered as they appear from top to bottom in the input. For each line in the output, the number is the first occurrence of a new non-zero block in the input.\n\nIn Example0, the first non-zero block is the row2 of 2s. Then row5 of 1s. Then row8 of3s. Then in row11, the 4s, then row14's 8s, then row17's6s. So each of these blocks is a new number, and they are added to the output in order. Each line in the output is the number repeated as many times as the number of such blocks. So 6 blocks, each line is six elements.\n\nIn Example1's output, three lines of [1,2,4]. The numbers 1,2,4 appear in columns 2,5,8 respectively. These columns have non-zero numbers throughout the rows where they are present. So perhaps the output is listing these numbers once per column, and each line in the output corresponds to the columns. The number of lines is equal to the number of rows that have these columns. But in Example1's input, there are 12 rows. So why three lines?\n\nAlternatively, the output for Example1 is [1,2,4] three times because there are three columns with these numbers. Each line represents one of the columns, and the elements are the numbers from the columns. But why three elements per line?\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to look for a different pattern. Maybe the output is the set of numbers that appear in the input, sorted, and each line is the numbers in order, repeated as many times as they appear in the input. But in Example0, the output numbers are 2,1,3,4,8,6, which are the unique numbers in order of appearance. Each is repeated six times, perhaps because there are six unique numbers.\n\nIn Example1's output, the numbers are 1,2,4. Three unique numbers, each repeated three times per line. Three lines, perhaps because they appear in three columns. \n\nIn Example2's output, four unique numbers (2,8,4,1), each repeated four times. Four lines. So perhaps the number of lines is the number of unique numbers, and each line is the number repeated as many times as there are unique numbers. \n\nIf that's the case, then for the test input, the unique numbers in the non-zero full rows are 4,6,1,7. Four unique numbers, so each line would be four elements. The output would be four lines, each line being one of the numbers repeated four times.\n\nBut in the test input, there are also other numbers like 2,3,5,8 in partial rows. So perhaps the pattern is only for full rows.\n\nBut in Example0, row11 is not a full row of 4s, but it's included in the output. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the output is capturing numbers from every non-zero row, whether full or partial. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the numbers from the rightmost blocks in each row. For Example0:\n\nRow2: all 2s \u2192 rightmost block is 2.\n\nRow5: all 1s \u2192 rightmost block 1.\n\nRow8: all3s \u21923.\n\nRow11: rightmost block 4s.\n\nRow14: rightmost block 8s.\n\nRow17: all6s \u21926.\n\nSo the output is the rightmost block of each non-zero row. \n\nIn Example0's output, the numbers are 2,1,3,4,8,6, which matches the rightmost blocks.\n\nFor Example1's input, the non-zero rows are rows5-11, which have 1,2,4 as their rightmost blocks. But the output is three lines of [1,2,4]. So each line corresponds to a row, and the line is the numbers from the rightmost blocks of the columns. Not sure.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nLooking at each non-zero row's rightmost block.\n\nRow0: ends with 2s \u21922.\n\nRow1:5s \u21925.\n\nRow2:5s \u21925.\n\nRow3:3s \u21923.\n\nRow4:5s \u21925.\n\nRow5:5s \u21925.\n\nRow6:8s \u21928.\n\nRow7:5s \u21925.\n\nRow9:4s \u21924.\n\nRow12:6s \u21926.\n\nRow15:1s \u21921.\n\nRow18:7s \u21927.\n\nSo the rightmost blocks are 2,5,5,3,5,5,8,5,4,6,1,7.\n\nBut Example0's output lists the rightmost blocks of each non-zero row. So in the test input, there are multiple rows with the same rightmost number. For example, many 5s. But the output in Example0 includes each such rightmost number once. So perhaps the output is the unique rightmost numbers, ordered by their first appearance. \n\nBut Example0's output includes all the rightmost numbers, including duplicates. Wait, no. In Example0's input, the rightmost blocks are 2,1,3,4,8,6. No duplicates, so each is included. \n\nIn the test input's rightmost blocks, there are duplicates (e.g., 5 appears multiple times). So the unique numbers would be 2,5,3,8,4,6,1,7. But the output would have eight lines. But the training examples' outputs don't include duplicates. So perhaps the output is the list of unique rightmost blocks, ordered by their first occurrence.\n\nBut then for the test input, the output would be:\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n[4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\n[6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n\nBut this has eight lines, each line with eight elements. This doesn't match the training examples. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find another approach. Let's look at the output formats:\n\nExample0's output has six lines, each with six elements. The numbers are 2,1,3,4,8,6. Each number appears once in the output, in the order of their first appearance in the input.\n\nExample1's output has three lines, each with three elements. The numbers are 1,2,4 in each line.\n\nExample2's output has four lines, each with four elements. The numbers are 2,8,4,1.\n\nSo the pattern might be that each output line is a list of numbers that appear in the same \"group\" vertically or horizontally, and each such group is represented by their numbers in order, repeated the number of groups.\n\nFor Example0, there are six groups (the non-zero rows), each line is a group's number, repeated six times.\n\nFor Example1, there are three vertical columns (1,2,4), so three groups. Each line lists all three numbers, repeated three times? But the lines are [1,2,4], which is three elements. So perhaps each line corresponds to a vertical group, and each line's elements are the numbers in that group. But in Example1, all vertical groups are present in each row, hence the same line repeated.\n\nFor the test input, perhaps the groups are the full rows of non-zero numbers. So row9 (4s), row12 (6s), row15 (1s), row18 (7s). So four groups. The output would have four lines, each line being the number repeated four times. So:\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[6,6,6,6]\n\n[1,1,1,1]\n\n[7,7,7,7]\n\nThis matches the structure of Example2's output, which has four lines of four elements each. And Example0's output has six lines of six elements each. So the number of lines equals the number of groups, and each line's length is the same as the number of groups.\n\nBut wait, in Example1, the output has three lines of three elements, but the groups are three vertical columns. So if that's the case, then the test input's four full rows would produce four lines, each with four elements. So the answer would be:\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[6,6,6,6]\n\n[1,1,1,1]\n\n[7,7,7,7]\n\nBut looking back at the test input's full rows:\n\nRow9: all 4s.\n\nRow12: all 6s.\n\nRow15: all 1s.\n\nRow18: all 7s.\n\nThese four rows are entirely filled with their respective numbers. So according to this pattern, the output should be four lines, each line being the number repeated four times. This matches the structure of Example2's output.\n\nTherefore, the pattern is:\n\nIdentify all rows in the input that are completely filled with a single non-zero number. For each such row, in the order they appear, create a line in the output. Each line consists of the number repeated as many times as the number of such rows.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nNumber of full non-zero rows: 4 (4,6,1,7).\n\nEach line in the output is the number repeated four times.\n\nThus, the output should be:\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[6,6,6,6]\n\n[1,1,1,1]\n\n[7,7,7,7]\n\nBut let's check if this aligns with the training examples.\n\nExample0's input has six such rows (2,1,3,4,8,6). So six lines, each with six elements. Yes.\n\nExample2's input has four such rows (2's row? No, row1 has 2s but not all. Wait, in Example2's input:\n\nRow1: [2,2,2,2,2,0,5,5,5,5,0,2] \u2192 not all 2s.\n\nRow4: [8,8,8,8,8,0,5,5,5,5,0,8] \u2192 not all 8s.\n\nRow7: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] \u2192 all 4s.\n\nRow10: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] \u2192 all 1s.\n\nSo two full rows: row7 (4s) and row10 (1s). But the output has four lines. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nHmm. This means my pattern is incorrect. Because in Example2's output, there are four lines, but according to the hypothesis, there are two full rows. So the pattern must be different.\n\nThis indicates that the pattern isn't based solely on full rows. Then what's the correct pattern?\n\nLet me re-examine Example2's input and output.\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRow1: [2,2,2,2,2,0,5,5,5,5,0,2] \u2192 two blocks of 2s (5 and 1) and two blocks of5s (4 and 0).\n\nRow4: [8,8,8,8,8,0,5,5,5,5,0,8] \u2192 two blocks of8s (5 and1) and two blocks of5s (4 and0).\n\nRow7: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] \u2192 all 4s.\n\nRow10: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] \u2192 all1s.\n\nThe output is:\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n\n[8,8,8,8]\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[1,1,1,1]\n\nEach line has four elements, four lines.\n\nSo the numbers are 2,8,4,1. These correspond to the first occurrences of the numbers in certain blocks. The 2s in row1's first block (5 2s), the 8s in row4's first block (5 8s), the 4s in row7, and the1s in row10. So perhaps the output is taking the first occurrence of each unique number in the input's blocks, ordered by their first occurrence, and each line is the number repeated the number of such unique numbers.\n\nIn Example2's case, four unique numbers (2,5,8,4,1, etc. but output is 2,8,4,1. So maybe the output is taking the first occurrence of each unique number in the order they appear, ignoring duplicates. But Example0's output includes 2,1,3,4,8,6\u2014all unique numbers in order of appearance. But according to this, the output would be each unique number once, repeated the number of unique times. Example0 has six unique numbers, so six lines, each with six elements. Which matches.\n\nExample1's output has three unique numbers (1,2,4), so three lines, each with three elements. Each line is the number repeated three times.\n\nExample2's output has four unique numbers (2,8,4,1), so four lines, each four elements.\n\nTest input's unique numbers in blocks:\n\nIn the test input, the unique numbers are 2,5,3,8,4,6,1,7.\n\nBut according to the examples, the output seems to include only the numbers from the full rows. But Example2's output includes 2 and8 which are not from full rows. So this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output includes all unique numbers that appear in any block, ordered by their first appearance. Each line is the number repeated as many times as the number of unique numbers.\n\nIn Example2's case, the unique numbers in the order of first appearance would be:\n\nRow1: 2.\n\nRow1:5.\n\nRow4:8.\n\nRow4:5 again.\n\nRow7:4.\n\nRow10:1.\n\nSo the unique numbers are 2,5,8,4,1. But the output has four lines. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. I'm running out of time. Based on the examples, the test input's output should have the numbers from the full rows. But Example2's output includes numbers from non-full rows. So perhaps the pattern is that the output includes the first occurrence of each unique number in the order they appear in the input, and each line is the number repeated the number of times equal to the number of such unique numbers.\n\nTest input's full rows are 4,6,1,7. Additionally, there are other numbers like 2,3,5,8. But according to Example0's output, which includes numbers from non-full rows (like 4 and8), the pattern must be different.\n\nWait, in Example0's input, row11 has 4s in a block, and row14 has 8s. So even though those rows are not completely filled, their blocks are included in the output. So the pattern must be that each contiguous block of a non-zero number is considered, and the output collects each such block's number, ordered by their first occurrence. Each line is the number repeated as many times as the total number of such blocks.\n\nExample0 has six blocks, so six lines. Each line is the number repeated six times.\n\nExample1 has three vertical columns of numbers (1,2,4), which can be considered as three blocks (each column is a vertical block). So three lines, each line three elements.\n\nTest input has multiple blocks. For example, row0's two 2s blocks, row1's 5s, row3's 3s and 5s, etc. The number of such blocks would be:\n\nBut this is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis for the test input: the output consists of the numbers from the rows that are completely filled with a single non-zero number, each line being the number repeated as many times as the number of such rows.\n\nTest input has four such rows: 4,6,1,7. So four lines, each line four elements.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[4,4,4,4]\n\n[6,6,6,6]\n\n[1,1,1,1]\n\n[7,7,7,7]\n\nBut according to Example2's input, which includes rows that are not completely filled, this hypothesis may be incorrect. However, given the time, I'll proceed with this answer.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by carefully looking at the examples given.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input has multiple rows with various numbers like 2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 8, 6, etc. The output lists these numbers in a certain order. The output rows are [2,2,2,2,2,2], [1,1,1,1,1,1], then 3, 4, 8, 6. So each output row seems to be a sequence of the same number repeated. Now, how are these selected from the input?\n\nIn the input of Example 0, the first non-zero row is [2,2,2,...] and that's the first output. Then the next non-zero row is [1,1,1,...], followed by [3,3,3,...]. Then looking at the rows that have a 5 and then 4, 8. Wait, but the output includes 4 and 8. Let's check the input rows again. Oh, in row 11 of the input, there's 4s, row 14 has 8s. So maybe it's taking each block of non-zero numbers, but not all of them. Wait, but the 5s are in some rows but not in the output. So perhaps there's a specific pattern for selecting which numbers to include.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0, the output has elements of length 6 each. The input rows with 2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 8, 6. Wait, the output includes 2,1,3,4,8,6. The 5s are in rows 10-14 but they don't appear in the output. So maybe the 5s are being excluded. Why? Maybe the pattern is to take the non-zero rows that are surrounded by zeros except for their own group. Or perhaps it's about the vertical arrangement. Alternatively, maybe each number in the output corresponds to a horizontal segment in the input, but only the longest ones or those that are contiguous.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1. The input has rows with 5s, then 1s, 2s, 4s. The output is [1,2,4] repeated three times. So the output takes the non-zero numbers in some order. But how? The input has rows where in some columns there are 1, 2, 4. For example, the last three rows have 1 in column 3, 2 in column 5, 4 in column 8. So maybe each column that contains a non-zero number across multiple rows contributes to the output. But the output is three rows each with [1,2,4]. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is constructed by taking each distinct non-zero number from the input, ordered by their first occurrence vertically. Then, each of those numbers is represented as a row in the output with as many elements as their maximum horizontal run in the input. But how does that fit the examples?\n\nLooking at Example 0 again: The output rows are 2,1,3,4,8,6. The numbers 2,1,3,4,8,6 each appear as full rows in the input. For example, row 2 is all 2s, row 5 is all 1s, row 8 is all 3s, row 14 (15th row) has 8s in the latter part. Wait, row 14's 8s are part of a longer row that starts with zeros. Wait, maybe the key is to look for horizontal runs of the same number surrounded by zeros. So in the input, each block of a number that is flanked by zeros on both ends (horizontally) contributes to the output. But how about vertically?\n\nIn Example 0's row 10: [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,...]. So the 5s are between zeros. But 5 is not in the output. So why is 5 excluded? Hmm. Maybe because there are multiple such blocks for 5. Or perhaps the blocks that are in the middle (not top or bottom) are ignored. Wait, but the output includes 4 and 8, which are in the lower rows. Alternatively, maybe the numbers in the output are those that form full rows (like rows 2,5,8,17) and the others are parts of rows. But in example 0, the 4 and 8 are in rows that have other numbers. Wait, row 11 in example 0 is [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. So there's a 4 block here. So maybe each horizontal segment (contiguous same numbers) in the input contributes to the output, but ordered from top to bottom and left to right? Or maybe grouped by their number and the maximum length of their occurrence.\n\nAlternatively, the output lists all the distinct numbers present in the input (excluding zero), ordered based on their first occurrence, and each output row is a sequence of that number repeated as many times as their maximum consecutive occurrence in the input.\n\nLooking at Example 0: Numbers 2,1,3,5,4,8,6. But the output is [2,1,3,4,8,6]. So 5 is missing. So that theory isn't correct. So why is 5 excluded?\n\nAnother possibility: The output consists of numbers that form \"blocks\" that are completely surrounded by zeros. For example, in Example 0's row 11, the 4s are after a zero, so maybe that's considered a block. The 5s in row 10 are between zeros on the left and right, but maybe they are part of a larger vertical structure. Alternatively, perhaps the output is capturing vertical sequences where a number is present in multiple consecutive rows, but that doesn't fit Example 0's output.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the output is [1,2,4] repeated three times. The input has columns where 1, 2, and 4 are present in multiple rows. For example, column 5 has 2 in all rows, column 3 has 1 in some rows, and column 8 has 4. So the output is taking these columns and listing the non-zero numbers in order. But how does that lead to three rows of [1,2,4]?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sequence of non-zero numbers from each row, but only taking the first occurrence of each number in each row. Then, collecting all unique numbers in the order they first appear. But in Example 0, the output has 2,1,3,4,8,6. The first occurrence of 2 is row 2, then 1 in row 5, then 3 in row 8, then 5 in row 10, but 5 isn't in the output. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to look for vertical alignment. In Example 0, the output's first entry is 2. Looking at the input, row 2 is all 2s. Then row 5 is all 1s, row 8 is all 3s. Then row 11 has 4s towards the end. Then row 14 has 8s. Then row 17 is all 6s. So perhaps the output is taking each full row (all elements the same and non-zero) in the input, in order, and then also other blocks that are part of rows. But in row 11, the 4s are part of a row with other elements. So that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is capturing all horizontal runs (contiguous same numbers) in the input, then listing them in the order they appear top to bottom, left to right. For example, in Example 0's input:\n\nRow 2: all 2s \u2192 one run of 2s (length 15) \u2192 output entry [2,2,2,2,2,2] (length 6). But why 6?\n\nWait, looking at the output lengths. In Example 0, all output rows have 6 elements. Example 1's output has rows of length 3. Example 2's output rows have 4 elements each. The test input's output rows would presumably vary. So maybe the length of the output rows corresponds to the maximum horizontal run of that number in the input. For example, in Example 0, the 2s have a run of 15, but the output row is 6. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are constructed by taking the count of non-zero numbers in each \"column\" and creating a row in the output for each number that appears in that column, ordered vertically. But I'm getting stuck.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern that would apply. The test input has rows with 2s, 5s, 3s, 8s, 4s, 6s, 1s, 7s. The output needs to be a list of these numbers in some order, each as a row of repeated elements.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the output seems to list the numbers in the order they first appear in the input, from top to bottom. For example, in Example 0, the first non-zero row is 2, then 1, then 3, then 5 (but not in output), then 4, 8, 6. So the output is 2,1,3,4,8,6. Wait, but 5 isn't included. So perhaps the rule is that numbers that form a horizontal run that is interrupted by zeros are included. For example, in Example 0, the 2s are a full row, so they're included. The 5s are in the middle of rows, surrounded by zeros, but maybe those runs are not counted. Or maybe only the runs that are surrounded by zeros.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, row 10 has a run of 6 5s (positions 1-6), followed by a 0. Then row 11 has a run of 5s (positions 1-6) and 4s (positions 8-14). So the 5s are part of a block that is present in multiple rows, but they aren't in the output. So why are the 4s and 8s included? Because they are in rows where they are preceded by zeros and then have a run. For example, in row 11, after the 0 at position 7, there are 4s. So maybe the 4s are a horizontal block that starts after a zero. Then in row 14, the 8s are after a zero. So maybe the pattern is to collect all horizontal runs of a number that are preceded and followed by zeros (or edges) in their row. Then, for each such run, create an entry in the output ordered by their position (top to bottom, left to right). Each entry is a list of the number repeated as many times as the run length. But in Example 0, the 2s are a full row, so they are preceded and followed by edges (since all elements are 2). So their run length is 15, but the output entry is 6 elements. Wait, that doesn't fit. Unless the output is truncating to a certain length. Wait, in Example 0's output, each row has 6 elements. The 2s run is 15, but the output is 6. So that can't be. Maybe the output takes the count of the number of rows where a particular number has a horizontal run. For example, 2 appears in one row (row 2), so the output entry is 6 elements (but why 6? Maybe the number of runs? Not sure.)\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking each number in the order they first appear as a horizontal block (regardless of position), and the output row's length is the number of times that number appears in such a block. For example, in Example 0, 2 appears once (row 2), 1 once (row 5), etc. But the output rows are all 6 elements long. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input and output. The output is:\n\n[2,2,2,2]\n[8,8,8,8]\n[4,4,4,4]\n[1,1,1,1]\n\nThe input has rows with 2s in row 1 (positions 0-4), then 8s in row 4 (positions 0-4), 4s in row 7 (full row), 1s in row 10 (full row). The output entries are each 4 elements. Wait, the 2s in row 1 are from index 0-4 (5 elements), but output is 4. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe it's the maximum consecutive run for each number. For 2s in row 1, there's a run of 5 elements (0-4) but output is 4. No. Maybe the output is taking the minimum run length across all instances of the number. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the numbers in the order they appear in the input, top to bottom, left to right, and each output row's length is the number of columns in the input. But in Example 0, the input has 15 columns, but output rows are 6. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: Looking for vertical alignment. For example, in Example 1's input, the output has three rows of [1,2,4]. The input has columns where 1,2,4 are present. Column 2 has 1s starting from row 5, column 5 has 2s, column 8 has 4s. So maybe each such column contributes to the output, and the output rows are the vertical sequences. But the output rows are [1,2,4], which are the numbers present in each column. So for each column that has non-zero numbers, collect them and output in the order of the columns. But in Example 1, the output has three rows. The input has columns with 1,2,4 that have non-zero entries. For example, column 2 has 1s from row 5-11. Column 5 has 2s from row 0-11. Column 8 has 4s from row 0-11. So maybe each such column contributes a row in the output with those numbers. But why three rows? Maybe because the columns are processed left to right, but the output is grouped by the numbers. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in Example 1's input, the first column is all zeros except for row 5-11 which have 1s. Column 5 is all 2s. Column 8 is all 4s. So the output is [1,2,4], but why three rows? Because the 1, 2, 4 appear in three columns. But the output is three rows of the same thing. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to find a different approach.\n\nLooking at all examples, the outputs consist of rows where each row is a list of the same number repeated. The numbers in the output are all the distinct non-zero numbers in the input, but not all of them. For example, in Example 0, 5 is present but not in the output. So there's a selection criteria.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is formed by taking each number that forms a horizontal line in the input, and these lines are sorted by the row they appear in. The length of each output line is the length of that horizontal line. But in Example 0, the 2s are in row 2 (length 15), but the output line is length 6. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the numbers that appear in rows that are entirely filled with that number (full rows), sorted by their row order. Then, the output entries are those numbers, each repeated a number of times equal to the number of full rows they occupy. But Example 0 has full rows for 2,1,3,6 (rows 2,5,8,17). The output includes 2,1,3,6, but also 4 and 8 which are not in full rows. So that's not it.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 4s are in row 11, but only part of the row. So why are they included in the output? Because maybe the output includes any contiguous block of a number that is surrounded by zeros. For example, the 4s in row 11 are preceded by a zero and followed by zeros. So the run is 7 4s. But the output entry for 4 is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4] but in the output it's [4,4,4,4,4,4]. Oh wait, in the output of Example 0, the 4s are [4,4,4,4,4,4], which is 6 elements, but the actual run is 7. Hmm. So maybe the output takes the first n elements, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the output entries are the number repeated the number of times equal to the number of rows they appear in. For example, 4 appears in row 11 (1 row), so the output entry has length 1. But that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output is ordered by the position of the first occurrence of each number. For example, in Example 0, the first occurrence of 2 is row 2. Then 1 is row 5, 3 row 8, 4 row 11, 8 row 14, 6 row 17. So the output is ordered as 2,1,3,4,8,6. But why is 5 excluded? Because perhaps 5's blocks are in the middle of the input rows and are not in full rows. Or maybe because 5's blocks are not part of vertical sequences.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the numbers in the order they appear in the input when read vertically column by column. For example, take each column, from left to right, and for each column, collect the non-zero numbers in order. Then, for each unique number, output a row with that number repeated as many times as the number of columns it appeared in. But this is getting too vague.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 1's input. The input has 12 rows. The output is three rows of [1,2,4]. Looking at the input, columns 2, 5, 8 have non-zero values. Column 2 has 1s from row 5-11. Column 5 has 2s from row 0-11. Column 8 has 4s from row 0-11. So maybe the output is taking each column that has a non-zero value and outputting the number in that column, and the number of rows is the number of columns with non-zero values. So for Example 1, there are three such columns (2,5,8), each with numbers 1,2,4. Hence, three rows in the output, each representing a column, with the number repeated as many times as the number of times they appear in that column. Wait, but in column 5, 2 appears 12 times (all rows). The output row for 2 would have 12 elements, but the output row is [1,2,4], which is three elements. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother idea: The output lists each distinct non-zero number in the input, sorted by their numeric value, and each row is that number repeated the number of times it appears in the input. But Example 0's output would have 2,1,3,4,5,6,8. But the output is missing 5. So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, the output lists numbers in the order they first appear in the input from top to bottom, left to right. For each number, the output row is the number repeated as many times as the maximum consecutive horizontal run in the input. For example, in Example 0:\n\n- 2: run of 15 \u2192 output row of 15 2s. But the output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. What do the output rows represent? In Example 0, each output row is a sequence of the same number, and the numbers are 2,1,3,4,8,6. The order is the same as the first occurrence of each number in the input. 2 appears first, then 1, then 3, then 5 (not in output), then 4, then 8, then 6. So why is 5 excluded? Because maybe 5 is part of a group that's surrounded by other numbers. Looking at the input rows that have 5: rows 10-14. For example, row 10: [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,...]. So the 5s are between zeros. So why isn't 5 in the output?\n\nAh, maybe the output only includes numbers that form full rows (all elements are the same and non-zero). But in Example 0, row 2 is full of 2s, row 5 full of 1s, row 8 full of 3s, row 17 full of 6s. So 2,1,3,6 are in the output. But then 4 and 8 are in the output. So that's not the case. So that theory is invalid.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the output includes 4 and 8. Looking at their rows:\n\nRow 11: [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. The 4s start at position 8 and run to the end. So the 4s are a contiguous block in row 11, but the row isn't all 4s. Similarly, row 14: [0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. So the 8s start at position 8. So maybe these are considered as separate blocks. So perhaps the output is capturing all horizontal contiguous blocks of a number (not zero) in the input, ordered by the first occurrence of each block from top to bottom, left to right. Then, for each block, the output row is the number repeated as many times as the length of the block. But if there are multiple blocks of the same number, they are combined, or only the first occurrence is considered.\n\nIn Example 0, the first blocks are:\n\nRow 2: 15 2s \u2192 output [2,2,2,2,2,2] (length 6). Hmm, why 6?\n\nAlternatively, the output is truncating each block to the first six elements. But in Example 0's output, the first row is six 2s. The input block is 15 2s. So maybe the output takes the first six elements of each block. But why six?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The output is three rows of [1,2,4]. Each row is length 3. The input has columns 2 (1s), 5 (2s), 8 (4s). So three columns. Each output row has three elements. So maybe each output row corresponds to a column with non-zero values, and the elements are the numbers present in that column. But why three rows?\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the columns with non-zero numbers are column 1 (5s), column 2 (5s), column 3 (5s), column 5 (2s), column 8 (4s), and column 2 (1s starting from row 5). So perhaps the output is the vertical sequence of numbers in these columns, but it's not clear. Alternatively, the output is listing the unique numbers in the order they appear vertically. But the output is [1,2,4] three times. Maybe for each row that contains a non-zero number, the output row is the sequence of non-zero numbers from left to right in that row. But in Example 1's input, row 5 has [0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,4,0], so the non-zero numbers are 1,2,4. Which matches the output row. Then rows 6-11 are similar, so the output is three rows of [1,2,4], which matches the three rows in the input where this pattern occurs.\n\nSo the pattern could be: For each row in the input, if the row contains non-zero numbers, extract those numbers in order (from left to right) and add as a row to the output. However, in Example 0, the first non-zero row is row 2 with all 2s, so the output would have a row of [2]. But the example's output has [2,2,2,2,2,2]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, Example 1's output has three rows of [1,2,4], which corresponds to rows 5-7 in the input where those non-zero numbers are present. But there are 8 rows (rows 5-11) with [0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,4,0], which have 1,2,4. So why three rows in the output? Maybe because the output is taking each unique occurrence of a combination of non-zero numbers. For example, if multiple consecutive rows have the same sequence of non-zero numbers, they are grouped into a single output row. But in Example 1, all those rows have the same non-zero numbers, so the output is three rows, which might be the number of columns with non-zero entries. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the unique combinations of non-zero numbers in the input rows, and each combination is represented once. But in Example 1, all the rows 5-11 have the same non-zero numbers (1,2,4), so the output would have one row. But the output has three rows. So that's not it.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nIn Example 0, the output has 6 rows. The input has 18 rows. The output rows are [2,2,2,2,2,2], [1,1,1,1,1,1], etc. Each output row's length is 6. Why 6?\n\nWait, maybe the output rows are the unique non-zero numbers in the input, sorted by the position of their first occurrence, and each is repeated the number of times equal to their count in the input. For example, 2 appears once (row 2), so output row is 6 2s. But why 6? That doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows' lengths are determined by the number of columns in the input. Example 0's input has 15 columns, but output rows are 6. Example 1's input has 10 columns, output rows are 3. Example 2's input has 12 columns, output rows are 4. So for example, 15 columns \u2192 6, 10 \u2192 3, 12 \u21924. Not sure. 15/6=2.5, 10/3\u22483.33, 12/4=3. Not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: For each example, look at the output and see how it relates to the input.\n\nExample 0's output is all the non-zero numbers in the order they first appear, but excluding 5. So 2,1,3,4,8,6. Each output row is the number repeated six times. But why six? Maybe the number of times they appear in their respective rows. For example, 2 appears in a row of 15 2s, so 15. But output is 6. Maybe the maximum number of digits in any number. But 15 is two digits. Not helpful.\n\nExample 1's output rows are three elements each, which matches the three non-zero numbers in each row. So for each input row that has non-zero numbers, the output row is those numbers in order. But in Example 1, many input rows have the same non-zero numbers. But the output has three rows. Maybe the output is the number of distinct non-zero numbers. But in Example 1, there are three (1,2,4), and three output rows. But each row is the same. So perhaps each output row corresponds to a distinct non-zero number, and the length is the number of times they appear in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as a grid. Each number forms a \"blob\" (contiguous region). The output lists each blob's number, ordered from top to bottom, left to right, and the length of each output row is the size of the blob. But in Example 0, the 2s are a full row (15 elements), but the output row for 2 has 6 elements. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by looking for \"islands\" of numbers (contiguous regions separated by zeros) in each row. For each such island, the number is added to the output, and the length of the output row is the width of the island. The output rows are ordered by the first occurrence of the island.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow 2: all 2s \u2192 one island of 2 (width 15) \u2192 output row [2 repeated 15 times]. But output has [2,2,2,2,2,2]. So that's not matching.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\nRows 5-11 have an island of 1 (width 1), 2 (width 1), and 4 (width 1). So output rows would be [1], [2], [4]. But the actual output is three rows of [1,2,4]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, the islands are collected, and each island contributes to the output. So for Example 0:\n\nRow 2: 2s \u2192 output [2,2,2,2,2,2] (assuming some truncation).\nRow 5: 1s \u2192 output [1,1,1,1,1,1].\nRow 8: 3s \u2192 output [3,3,3,3,3,3].\nRow 10: 5s (positions 1-6) \u2192 output [5,5,5,5,5,5].\nRow 11: 5s (positions 1-6) and 4s (positions 8-14) \u2192 output [5,5,5,5,5,5] and [4,4,4,4,4,4].\nRow 14: 5s (1-6) and 8s (8-14) \u2192 output [5,5,5,5,5,5] and [8,8,8,8,8,8].\nRow 17: 6s \u2192 output [6,6,6,6,6,6].\n\nBut the actual output of Example 0 doesn't include the 5s. So why are they excluded? Maybe only islands that are present in multiple rows. Or islands that are vertically aligned.\n\nAlternatively, the output is capturing each vertical column that has a non-zero value, and each output row corresponds to a column, listing the non-zero number in that column. But in Example 0, there are 15 columns. The output has 6 rows, which doesn't match.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nTest input has rows with 2s, 5s, 3s, 8s, 4s, 6s, 1s, 7s.\n\nLooking for the output: the numbers are 2,5,3,8,4,6,1,7. But according to the examples, certain numbers might be excluded. For example, in Example 0, 5 was excluded. So why?\n\nIn Example 0, the 5s are in multiple rows but surrounded by zeros. But they're not in the output. So perhaps the rule is that a number is included in the output only if it appears in a full row. But in Example 0's input, 4 and 8 are not in full rows but are included. So that theory is invalid.\n\nAlternative idea: The output lists the numbers that form vertical lines (i.e., appear in the same column across multiple consecutive rows). For example, in Example 1, the 2s are in column 5 of all rows, so they form a vertical line, and similarly for 4 in column 8 and 1 in column 2. The output lists these numbers. But how does that determine the order and repetition?\n\nIn the test input:\n\n- The first row has 2s in positions 0-6, then zeros, then 2s in 16-18.\n- The third row has 3s in positions 0-6, then zeros, then 3s in 16-18.\n- The seventh row has 8s in positions 0-6, then zeros, then 8s in 16-18.\n- The ninth row has 4s in all positions.\n- The twelfth row has 6s in all positions.\n- The fifteenth row has 1s in all positions.\n- The eighteenth row has 7s in all positions.\n\nSo the full rows are row 9 (4s), row 12 (6s), row 15 (1s), row 18 (7s).\n\nAdditionally, there are partial rows:\n\nRow 0: 2s in 0-6 and 16-18.\n\nRow 3: 3s in 0-6 and 16-18.\n\nRow 6: 8s in 0-6 and 16-18.\n\nRow 17: 7s in all positions.\n\nBut according to the training examples, in Example 0, the output includes numbers from both full rows and partial rows. So perhaps any number that has a contiguous block (horizontal run) surrounded by zeros in its row is included. For example, in the test input's row 0, the 2s are in positions 0-6 (run of 7), surrounded by zeros on the right (positions 7-15 are zeros) and then another run of 2s at 16-18. So these are two separate blocks of 2s. Each block would be included in the output. Similarly for the 3s, 8s, etc.\n\nBut in Example 0, the 5s are in blocks but not in the output. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking each horizontal run of a number (surrounded by zeros or edges) and creating an entry in the output for each such run, ordered by the position of their first occurrence. The entry is the number repeated the length of the run.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- The first run is row 2's 2s (15) \u2192 entry [2 repeated 15 times]. But the output entry is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output entries are the numbers sorted by their numeric value, and each entry's length is the number of times the number appears in the input. But in Example 0, 2 appears once, 1 once, 3 once, 4 once, 8 once, 6 once. So each would have length 1, but output entries are 6.\n\nThis isn't making sense. Maybe the answer is to list all the non-zero numbers in the order they first appear in the input, and for each, output a row with that number repeated the number of times equal to the number of times they appear in the input. But in Example 0, 2 appears once (full row), 1 once, 3 once, 4 once, 8 once, 6 once. So each output row would be of length 1. But the output rows are longer.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the numbers in the order of their first occurrence, each repeated the number of times they appear as a horizontal run in their respective row. For example, in Example 0's row 2: 2s run of 15 \u2192 output 15 2s. But the output has 6. So that's not it.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the test input and see what the expected output might be.\n\nTest input has full rows of 4s (row 9), 6s (row 12), 1s (row 15), and 7s (row 18). Also, rows 0,3,6 have runs of 2s, 3s, and 8s respectively. For example, row 0: 2s in positions 0-6 (7 elements), then zeros, then 2s in 16-18 (3 elements). So two runs of 2s. Row 3: 3s in 0-6 and 16-18. Row 6: 8s in 0-6 and 16-18.\n\nIf the pattern is to take each horizontal run of a number (surrounded by zeros) and include them in the output, ordered by their first occurrence, then the test input would have the following runs:\n\n- Row 0: 2s (7), then 2s (3)\n- Row 3: 3s (7), then 3s (3)\n- Row 6: 8s (7), then 8s (3)\n- Row 9: 4s (19)\n- Row 12: 6s (19)\n- Row 15: 1s (19)\n- Row 18: 7s (19)\n- Also, the 5s in rows 1-7 (columns 8-14) for each row. Each of these rows has a run of 7 5s surrounded by zeros. So multiple runs of 5s.\n\nBut according to the examples, like Example 0, 5s were present but not in the output. So perhaps the 5s are excluded. So in the test input, the output would include the 2s,3s,8s,4s,6s,1s,7s. Each of their runs. But how to order them.\n\nBut in the training examples, the output lists the numbers in the order of their first occurrence in the input. So for the test input, the first non-zero number is row 0, which is 2. Then row 3 has 3s. Then row 6 has 8s. Then row 9 has 4s. Then row 12 has 6s. Then row 15 has 1s. Then row 18 has 7s. The 5s are in rows 1-7 but they might be excluded as in Example 0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n[6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6]\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n[7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the output rows are shorter than the input runs. For example, in Example 0, the 2s run is 15, but output is 6. So perhaps the output truncates the runs to a certain length. Like, taking the first occurrence's length but only up to a certain number. Or perhaps the output rows are the number of rows each number appears in. For example, in Example 0, 2 appears in one row, so output is 6 elements. But why 6?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the number of times the number appears in the input, but that doesn't fit. For example, in Example 0, 2 appears in one row (15 elements), but the output row is 6.\n\nThis is really confusing. Given that I'm stuck, I'll try to see if there's another approach.\n\nLooking at all examples again, each output row is a list of the same number, and the numbers are ordered based on their first appearance in the input. For example:\n\n- Example 0: 2 (row 2), 1 (row 5), 3 (row 8), 4 (row 11), 8 (row 14), 6 (row 17).\n\n- Example 1: 2 (row 0), 5 (row 1), 1 (row 5), 4 (row 0). But the output is [1,2,4]. So maybe the order is based on the first occurrence of the number in the entire input. In Example 1, the first non-zero number is 2 (row 0, column 5), then 5 (row 1), then 1 (row 5), then 4 (row 0, column 8). But the output is [1,2,4]. So this doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are ordered based on their first occurrence in the input when scanned row by row, left to right. For Example 0, the first non-zero number is 2 in row 2. Then in row 5, 1. Then row 8, 3. Then in row 10, 5. Then row 11, 4. Row 14, 8. Row 17, 6. But the output includes 2,1,3,4,8,6. So 5 is skipped. So why is 5 skipped?\n\nPerhaps because 5's runs are part of a vertical block that is surrounded by other non-zero numbers. Or perhaps the output only includes numbers that appear in full rows. But row 9 in the test input is a full row of 4s, so included.\n\nAnother possible clue: In Example 0, the output rows have six elements each. The numbers 2,1,3,4,8,6 are six numbers. Each output row corresponds to a number, and the length is the count of the number's first occurrence in the input. For example, 2's first run is 15 elements, but the output row is 6. Not sure.\n\nGiven that time is limited and I need to provide an answer, I'll make a educated guess based on the examples. The pattern seems to be that the output lists each number that forms a full row (entire row is that number), and each such number is represented as a row in the output with the number repeated as many times as the row's length. If that's the case, then in Example 0's input, the full rows are 2 (row 2), 1 (row5), 3 (row8), 6 (row17). But the output also includes 4 and 8. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output lists numbers that appear in full rows or in runs that are surrounded by zeros. For example, in Example 0, row 11 has 4s after zeros. So that's a run surrounded by zeros. Hence, included. Similarly for 8 in row 14. So the output collects all such runs, ordered by their first occurrence, and each entry is the number repeated the length of the run. But why in Example 0, the output entries are six elements?\n\nWait, Example 0's output entries are 6 elements each. The runs for 2 (15), 1 (15), 3 (15), 4 (7), 8 (7), 6 (15). But the output entries are all 6. So perhaps the output truncates each run to six elements. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the output entries are the numbers repeated the number of times they appear in the input. For example, 2 appears in one row, 1 in one row, etc., but this doesn't explain the length.\n\nAnother possible pattern is that the output lists the numbers in the order of their first appearance in the input, and each output row's length is the number of rows in which that number appears. For example, in Example 0:\n\n- 2 appears in row 2 \u2192 1 row \u2192 output row length 1. But the output row is six 2s. So no.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the test input. The test input has full rows of 4s, 6s, 1s, and 7s. Additionally, rows 0,3,6 have runs of 2s,3s,8s. So if the output includes each distinct number in the order they first appear, and each is repeated six times (as in Example 0), then the output would be:\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[4,4,4,4,4,4]\n[6,6,6,6,6,6]\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n[7,7,7,7,7,7]\n\nBut in the test input, the first full row is row 9 (4s), which comes after the runs of 2s,3s,8s. So their order would be 2,3,8,4,6,1,7.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the output may list the numbers in the order they first appear as full rows. But row 0 has a partial run of 2s, but a full row of 4s comes later. So the order could be 4,6,1,7, but that doesn't account for the partial runs.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll go with the following hypothesis: The output lists each distinct non-zero number from the input in the order of their first occurrence, and each output row is the number repeated six times, regardless of their actual run length. But in Example 1, the output rows are three elements long. So that doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother last-minute idea: The output rows are the numbers that form vertical columns, and each row's length is the height of the column. For example, in Example 1, the columns with 2s are 12 rows tall \u2192 output row of 12 2s, but the output is three rows of three elements. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm truly stuck, I'll have to look for the common elements in the examples. For instance, in Example 0, the output entries are all the non-zero numbers except 5, ordered by their first occurrence, and each entry is six elements long. Example 1's output entries are three elements long, and each row is [1,2,4]. Example 2's output entries are four elements long. Maybe the output rows are each non-zero number in the order of their first appearance, and each row's length is the number of columns in the input divided by a certain factor. For example, Example 0's input has 15 columns, output rows are 15/2.5=6. Example 1's input has 10 columns, output rows are 3 (10/3.33). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the unique non-zero numbers, ordered by their first occurrence, and each row's length is the number of times the number appears in the input. For Example 0, 2 appears once (row 2), 1 once (row5), 3 once (row8), 4 once (row11), 8 once (row14), 6 once (row17). So each entry would be one element. But the output has six elements per row.\n\nGiven that I can't find the pattern, but the test input's expected output needs to be in the format of the training examples, I'll proceed to list the distinct non-zero numbers in the order they first appear in the input, each as a row of the number repeated six times. But in Example 1, the output rows are three elements. So perhaps the number of elements per row is the number of columns in the input divided by some factor. For example, in Example 1's input, columns are 10, output is 3. 10/3 \u2248 3.33. Not sure. Alternatively, the number of elements per row is the number of distinct non-zero numbers. Example 0 has six distinct numbers, output rows are six elements. Example 1 has three distinct numbers, output rows are three elements. Example 2 has four distinct numbers (2,8,4,1), output rows are four elements. That fits! So the output rows are the distinct non-zero numbers in order of first appearance, each repeated as many times as the number of distinct non-zero numbers. For example:\n\nExample 0: 6 distinct numbers \u2192 each row has 6 elements.\n\nExample 1: 3 distinct numbers \u2192 each row has 3 elements.\n\nExample 2: 4 distinct numbers \u2192 each row has 4 elements.\n\nSo the test input has 2,5,3,8,4,6,1,7 \u2192 8 distinct numbers. So each output row would have 8 elements. But wait, looking back at the examples:\n\nExample 0's output rows have 6 elements each. The number of distinct non-zero numbers is 6 (2,1,3,4,8,6).\n\nExample 1's output has 3 elements per row, number of distinct non-zero numbers is 3.\n\nExample 2's output has 4 elements per row, distinct non-zero numbers are 4.\n\nSo the pattern is: Each output row has a length equal to the number of distinct non-zero numbers in the input, and each row is the same number repeated that many times.\n\nSo for each distinct non-zero number in the order of first appearance, the output row is that number repeated K times, where K is the number of distinct non-zero numbers.\n\nIn Example 0, K=6 \u2192 each row has six elements.\n\nIn Example 1, K=3 \u2192 each row has three elements.\n\nIn Example 2, K=4 \u2192 each row has four elements.\n\nSo the test input has 7 distinct non-zero numbers: 2,5,3,8,4,6,1,7 \u2192 8 distinct numbers. So each output row would have 8 elements. But looking at the test input:\n\nTest input's numbers are:\n\n2 (row 0), 5 (row1),3 (row3),8 (row6),4 (row9),6 (row12),1 (row15),7 (row18).\n\nSo eight distinct numbers. Therefore, each output row would be each of these numbers repeated eight times. So the output would be:\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n[6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6]\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n[7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n\nBut looking at the examples, in Example 1, the output has three rows each of [1,2,4], which are three elements. This contradicts the previous hypothesis. Because in Example 1, the distinct numbers are 5,2,1,4 (wait, the input has 5,2,1,4). So four distinct numbers. But the output has three elements per row. So this contradicts the pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the numbers are 5,2,1,4. So four distinct numbers. But the output rows are three elements each. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Back to square one.\n\nAlternative conclusion: The output rows are the distinct non-zero numbers in the order of their first appearance, and each row is the number repeated the number of times equal to the number of rows in the input where that number appears. For Example 0:\n\n- 2 appears in 1 row \u2192 output row of 1 element. But output is six elements. So no.\n\nI'm really stuck. Given the time, I'll have to make a best guess based on the test input. The test input's output should list each distinct non-zero number in the order of their first appearance, each as a row of the number repeated six times (like Example 0). However, this doesn't fit Example 1 and 2. So perhaps the answer for the test input is:\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[4,4,4,4,4,4]\n[6,6,6,6,6,6]\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n[7,7,7,7,7,7]\n\nExcluding 5s and others. But why? Because in Example 0, 5s were excluded. So maybe the output includes only numbers that appear in full rows. In the test input, full rows are 4,6,1,7. So output would be:\n\n[4,4,4,4,4,4]\n[6,6,6,6,6,6]\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n[7,7,7,7,7,7]\n\nBut that doesn't fit the examples. For example, Example 0's output includes numbers not in full rows. So this is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the following approach based on the examples:\n\nThe output lists each distinct non-zero number from the input in the order they first appear, and each number is represented as a row with the number repeated the number of times equal to the number of rows in which they appear as a contiguous block. For example, in Example 0, 2 appears once (row 2), 1 once (row5), etc. So each row in the output is that number repeated once. But the output has six elements. So this is not correct.\n\nFinal guess: The output is formed by taking each distinct non-zero number in the order of their first appearance, and each row is the number repeated the number of columns in the input divided by some factor. Since Example 0 has 15 columns and output rows of 6, Example 1 has 10 columns and output rows of 3, which is 15/2.5=6, 10/3.33=3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of elements per row is the number of columns divided by 2.5. 15/2.5=6, 10/2.5=4, but Example 1's output has 3 elements. So that doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to answer with the following output for the test input:\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[3,3,3,3,3,3]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[4,4,4,4,4,4]\n[6,6,6,6,6,6]\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n[7,7,7,7,7,7]\n\nThis follows the pattern of Example 0, where each number in order of appearance is repeated six times. However, the actual correct answer may differ. But given the time constraints, this is my best guess.",
