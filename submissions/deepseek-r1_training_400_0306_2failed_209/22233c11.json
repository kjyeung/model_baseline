        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples, then apply that to the test input. Let me look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some 3s placed around. The output introduces 8s in certain positions. Looking at the input, the 3s are at positions like [3][2], [4][3], [6][7], [7][6]. In the output, the 8s are added. Let me check their positions. For instance, in the output, row 2 has an 8 at column 4. Maybe that's diagonally between two 3s? Let me see. The 3 at [3][2] (row 3, column 2, 0-based?) and the 3 at [4][3] (row4, col3). The midpoint between those would be (3.5, 2.5) but in grid terms, maybe the cell in the middle? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are mirrored relative to the 3s. Or perhaps they're placed at the intersection points of lines formed by the 3s.\n\nWait, maybe each 3 is part of some structure, and the 8s are added in certain directions. Let me look for another approach. Let's consider the output 8s. In Example 0's output, the 8s are at [2][4], [5][1], [5][5], [8][8]. Hmm. Maybe each 8 is placed in the direction opposite to where the 3s are. Like, if there are 3s arranged diagonally, the 8s are placed in the opposite diagonal direction. Wait, in Example 0's input, there's a diagonal of 3s from (3,2) down to (4,3) (maybe a diagonal going southeast), but in the output, the 8 is at (2,4). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the 8s are placed in cells that are equidistant from two 3s. Let me check the positions.\n\nIn Example 0's input: 3 at (3,2), (4,3), (6,7), (7,6). So, between (3,2) and (4,3), the midpoint would be (3.5, 2.5). But since grid cells are integers, maybe the cell that's in between. Wait, if those two 3s form a diagonal, the midpoint might be the cell that's adjacent in some way. Alternatively, maybe the 8 is placed in a cell that is mirrored across some axis. For instance, if there's a 3 in (3,2), maybe the 8 is placed in (3, 8-2-1) or something? Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. Input has 3s forming a square? Like in rows 3 and 4, columns 3-4 (since [3][3], [3][4], [4][3], [4][4] are 3s. Then in rows 5 and 6, columns 1-2 are 3s. The output has 8s in rows 1 and 2 column 0, and rows 7 and 8 columns 5 and 6. So maybe the 8s are placed symmetrically around the groups of 3s. For the square of 3s in the middle, perhaps the 8s are added above and below. Like the group in rows 3-4, columns 3-4, then 8s are added in rows 1-2, columns 0 (but that's far left). Maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are placed at the corners of some larger square around the 3s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s form certain shapes, and the 8s are placed in the cells that are equidistant from multiple 3s. For example, in Example 0, maybe each pair of 3s contributes an 8 in the middle. Let's see: the 3s at (3,2) and (4,3) would have a midpoint at (3.5, 2.5), which is in cell (3,2) or (3,3)? Not exactly. The 8 in Example 0's output at row 2, column 4 (assuming rows are 0-based). Hmm. Maybe that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the outputs, the 8s are placed in positions that are either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally aligned with the 3s but at a certain distance. For example, in Example 0, the 8 in row 5, column 1: maybe that's two steps left and two steps down from a 3. Let's check. The 3s in the input are in row3, col2. If I go two steps left (col0) and two steps down (row5), that would land at (5,0), but the 8 is at (5,1). Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in cells that form a cross or some other pattern relative to the 3s.\n\nWait, maybe the 8s are added in the positions that are adjacent to the 3s but in a certain direction. Let's look at Example 2. The input has 3s at (3,3) and (4,4). The output adds 8s at (2,5) and (5,2). So those are diagonally opposite. For example, from (3,3), moving up-left would be (2,2), but the 8s are at (2,5) and (5,2). Wait, maybe if the two 3s are at (3,3) and (4,4), forming a diagonal, the 8 is placed at the reflection across that diagonal. But (3,3) and (4,4) form a diagonal of two cells. The midpoint would be (3.5, 3.5), and reflecting points around that. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed at positions that are mirrored across the center of the grid. The grid is 10x10, so center would be between (4.5,4.5). For Example 2, the 3s are at (3,3) and (4,4), which are on the diagonal. The output 8s are at (2,5) and (5,2). Those positions are symmetric with respect to the center. Let me check: (2,5) and (5,2) are mirrored over the center. Similarly, in Example 0's output, the 8s are at (2,4), (5,1), (5,5), (8,8). Let's see if those are mirrored. (2,4) and (8,8): not exactly. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe each 3 in the input causes an 8 to be placed at a certain distance in a specific direction. For instance, each 3 has an 8 placed two cells up and two cells to the right. But in Example 0, the 3 at (3,2) would lead to (1,4), which is not an 8. But the output has (2,4). Maybe one cell up and two right. (3-1=2, 2+2=4. That gives (2,4), which is one of the 8s in Example 0's output. Then the 3 at (4,3) would be (4-1=3, 3+2=5 \u2192 (3,5). But in the output, there's no 8 there. Hmm. Maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are placed at positions that are three cells away in a certain direction from each 3. Let's see. For Example 2's 3 at (3,3), adding three to the column gives (3,6), but there's an 8 at (2,5) which is not three cells. Maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: Look for the positions of 8s relative to the 3s. Let's take all examples.\n\nExample 0 Output 8s:\n\nRow 2, column 4.\n\nRow 5, column 1 and 5.\n\nRow 8, column 8.\n\nExample 1 Output 8s:\n\nRows 1 and 2, column 0 (two 8s).\n\nRows 7 and 8, columns 5 and 6 (four 8s).\n\nExample 2 Output 8s:\n\nRow 2, column 5.\n\nRow 5, column 2.\n\nLooking for a pattern, maybe each group of 3s in the input causes 8s to be placed in a certain pattern around them. For example, in Example 1's input, there are two blocks of 3s. The upper block (rows 3-4, columns 3-4) is a 2x2 square. The lower block (rows 5-6, columns 1-2) is another 2x2 square. The output has 8s in the top left (rows 1-2, column 0) and bottom right (rows 7-8, columns 5-6). These are like mirrored positions relative to the 3s' blocks. Similarly, in Example 0, the 3s are arranged diagonally in two places (upper left and lower right?), and the 8s are in positions that form a cross or other shape.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are placed in the positions that form a diamond shape around clusters of 3s, but offset by some distance. For example, in Example 0, the 3s are in two diagonal pairs, and the 8s form a diamond around them.\n\nWait, let's think of the grid as a coordinate system. For each 3, maybe the 8s are placed in cells that are a certain Manhattan distance away. For instance, for each 3, place an 8 in cells that are two steps away in certain directions. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are placed in cells that are at the intersection of lines drawn from the 3s. For example, if two 3s are aligned in a certain way, their lines would intersect at an 8. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 2, the two 3s are at (3,3) and (4,4). Drawing a line from each 3 in a certain direction. For instance, if each 3 emits lines in four diagonal directions, the intersection points might have 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of each 3 as a point, and the 8s are placed at points that form a certain geometric shape with them, like a square or diamond.\n\nAnother idea: The 8s are placed in the positions that are the furthest possible from the 3s, but maybe in some pattern. However, in Example 0, the 8s are in the middle and edges, so that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input and output. The input has two 2x2 squares of 3s. The output has 8s forming two 2x2 squares as well, but in the top-left and bottom-right. For the upper 2x2 3s (rows 3-4, columns 3-4), the 8s are in rows 1-2, column 0. For the lower 2x2 3s (rows 5-6, columns 1-2), the 8s are in rows 7-8, columns 5-6. So it's like each 2x2 square of 3s causes a 2x2 square of 8s mirrored across some axis. The upper 3s are centered around (3.5, 3.5), and their 8s are at (1.5, 0.5), which is shifted left by 3 columns and up by 2 rows. Not sure. Alternatively, mirrored over a vertical axis. For example, the upper 3s are at columns 3-4, and their 8s are at column 0. If mirrored left-right, but that's not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each group of 3s is shifted by a certain amount to get the 8s. For instance, the upper 3s in Example 1 (rows 3-4, cols 3-4) might be shifted up by 2 rows and left by 3 columns to get the 8s in rows 1-2, column 0. Similarly, the lower 3s (rows 5-6, cols 1-2) are shifted down by 2 rows and right by 3 columns to rows 7-8, cols 4-5, but the output has cols 5-6. Not exactly.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach: Count the number of 8s in each example. Example 0 has 4 8s. Example 1 has 6 8s (two in rows 1-2, col0; four in rows 7-8, cols5-6). Wait, no, in Example 1's output, rows 1 and 2 each have one 8 at column 0. Then in rows 7 and 8, columns 5 and 6 each have two 8s. So total 2 + 4 = 6? Or maybe 8s in (1,0), (2,0), (7,5), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6) \u2192 6 8s. For Example 0, the 8s are at (2,4), (5,1), (5,5), (8,8) \u2192 4. Example 2 has two 8s.\n\nSo the number of 8s corresponds to the number of 3s? In Example 0's input, there are four 3s. Output has four 8s. Example 1's input has 8 3s (each 2x2 square has 4, so 8 total), and the output has 6 8s. Wait, that doesn't match. Example 2's input has two 3s, output has two 8s. So maybe each 3 in the input contributes one 8, but sometimes multiple 3s contribute to the same 8. For example, two 3s could lead to one 8 in their midpoint.\n\nIn Example 2, two 3s lead to two 8s, which suggests that each 3 contributes one 8. So maybe each 3 has an 8 placed in a certain direction. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 3s at (3,3) and (4,4). The output 8s are at (2,5) and (5,2). Let's see: (3,3) to (2,5) is up one row and right two columns. Or maybe it's a knight's move in chess (two in one direction and one in the other). Or perhaps each 3 is shifted up and right by a certain amount. Let's check for other examples.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first 3 is at (3,2). The output has an 8 at (2,4). So from (3,2), moving up 1 row and right 2 columns: yes. Then the next 3 is at (4,3). If applying the same shift, up 1, right 2: (3,5). But in the output, there's no 8 there. Instead, there's an 8 at (5,5). Wait, maybe different directions for different 3s. Or maybe each 3 has a corresponding 8 in a certain diagonal direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 3 is part of a diagonal line, and the 8 is placed at the end of that diagonal. For example, if a 3 is part of a diagonal going northeast, the 8 is placed two cells in that direction. Let's test:\n\nIn Example 0's first 3 at (3,2). Suppose the diagonal is northeast. Two cells in that direction would be (3-2=1, 2+2=4) \u2192 (1,4). But the output 8 is at (2,4). Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 3 has an 8 placed two cells to the right and one cell up. For (3,2), that would be (3-1=2, 2+2=4) \u2192 (2,4), which is present in the output. The next 3 at (4,3): (4-1=3, 3+2=5) \u2192 (3,5). But in the output, that cell is 0. Hmm. Maybe that's not consistent.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's output, the 8s are at (2,4), (5,1), (5,5), (8,8). Let's check the input 3s and see:\n\n(3,2) \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 up 1, right 2.\n\n(4,3) \u2192 (5,5) \u2192 down 1, right 2.\n\n(6,7) \u2192 (5,5) \u2192 up 1, left 2? No, (6-1=5, 7-2=5 \u2192 yes. So maybe for that 3, it's up 1 and left 2.\n\n(7,6) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 down 1, right 2.\n\nHmm, this seems inconsistent. So for each 3, the 8 could be in one of four possible directions: up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right. But how to choose which direction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction depends on the position of the 3 relative to other 3s. For example, if two 3s are adjacent, the 8 is placed in a certain direction relative to their formation. But this might get complicated.\n\nAnother angle: looking for symmetry. In Example 0's output, the 8s are arranged symmetrically in some way. For example, (2,4) and (8,8) are mirrored along the center of the grid. Let's check: The grid is 10x10, so the center is between (4.5,4.5). (2,4) mirrored would be (7,5), which isn't an 8. Alternatively, maybe mirrored across the diagonal. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are placed in positions that form a certain geometric shape when connected. For Example 0, connecting the 8s might form a diamond or cross.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output. The 8s are arranged in two vertical lines (cols 0 and 5-6) and two horizontal lines (rows 1-2 and 7-8). The input's 3s are in two 2x2 squares. The 8s are perhaps placed in the opposite quadrants. For example, the upper 3s (middle-right) have 8s in the upper-left, and the lower 3s (lower-left) have 8s in the lower-right. That might be a pattern. So each group of 3s in a certain quadrant have 8s placed in the opposite quadrant.\n\nApplying that to the test input. The test input has 3s in rows 2-4, columns 6-8 (forming a 3x3 block on the right upper part) and rows 5-7, columns 3-5 (forming a 3x3 block on the left lower part). If the pattern is to place 8s in the opposite quadrants, then the upper-right 3s would have 8s in the lower-left, and the lower-left 3s would have 8s in the upper-right. Let's see.\n\nThe upper 3s are in rows 2-4, columns 6-8. The opposite quadrant would be lower-left: rows 5-7, columns 0-2. The lower 3s are in rows5-7, columns3-5. Their opposite quadrant would be upper-right: rows 0-2, columns 5-7. So maybe the 8s are placed in those areas.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output: The upper 3s (rows 3-4, columns3-4) had 8s placed in rows 1-2, column 0 (upper-left), which is a different quadrant. Wait, maybe the pattern is to mirror the positions of the 3s across the center of the grid. For instance, the center is at (4.5,4.5). So for each 3 at (row, col), the 8 is placed at (9-row, 9-col). Let's check:\n\nIn Example 2's input, the 3s are at (3,3) and (4,4). Mirrored would be (6,6) and (5,5). But the output's 8s are at (2,5) and (5,2). Hmm, not matching. (3,3) mirrored is (6,6), which isn't in the output. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, mirrored across the vertical or horizontal axis. For Example 1's upper 3s (rows3-4, cols3-4), mirrored across the vertical axis would be cols5-6. But the 8s are in cols0. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: The 8s are placed in cells that form a cross shape centered on the 3s. For instance, each 3 has 8s placed two cells above, below, left, and right. But in Example 0, the 3 at (3,2) would have 8s at (1,2), (5,2), (3,0), (3,4). But the output doesn't show those.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are placed where the Manhattan distance from the 3s is a certain number. For example, distance 3. For Example 2's 3 at (3,3), a Manhattan distance of 3 would include cells like (0,3), (3,0), (6,3), etc. But the 8s are at (2,5) and (5,2), which are Manhattan distance 2+2=4 and 3+1=4. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are placed at the positions that form a specific geometric relation to clusters of 3s. For instance, for a line of 3s, place 8s perpendicular to the line. For example, in Example 0's input, the 3s are in diagonal lines. The 8s are placed in positions that are perpendicular to those diagonals. \n\nAlternatively, think of the 3s as forming vectors, and the 8s are placed at the sum or difference of those vectors. But this is vague.\n\nLet me try to find a common pattern among all examples. \n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput 3s:\n\n(3,2), (4,3), (6,7), (7,6).\n\nOutput 8s:\n\n(2,4), (5,1), (5,5), (8,8).\n\nLooking for a pattern between each 3 and the corresponding 8. Let's take (3,2) \u2192 (2,4). The difference is (-1, +2). \n\n(4,3) \u2192 (5,5): (+1, +2).\n\n(6,7) \u2192 (5,5): (-1, -2).\n\n(7,6) \u2192 (8,8): (+1, +2).\n\nHmm, not consistent. So maybe some of the 3s are transformed with different vectors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 3 has an 8 placed in a direction that's orthogonal to its position relative to other 3s. For example, if two 3s form a diagonal, the 8 is placed in the perpendicular direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed at the corners of a square that surrounds the 3s. For Example 0's 3s, maybe the 8s form the corners of a larger square. But it's unclear.\n\nAnother idea: The number 8 is a rotated or mirrored version of 3. So perhaps the 8s are placed in positions that are mirrored or rotated relative to the 3s. For example, each 3's position is rotated 180 degrees around the center of the grid to place an 8. Let's check:\n\nFor Example 0's 3 at (3,2). The center is at (4.5,4.5). Rotating 180 degrees would take (3,2) to (6,7). But there's a 3 at (6,7) in the input. So that's not an 8. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, rotated 90 degrees. (3,2) rotated 90 would be (2, 6) (assuming rotation around center). Not matching any 8s.\n\nAlternatively, mirrored across the vertical axis. (3,2) becomes (3,7). No 8 there.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the 8s are placed in the cells that are equidistant from two 3s. For instance, in Example 2, the two 3s are at (3,3) and (4,4). The midpoint is (3.5,3.5), which isn't a grid cell. But the 8s are at (2,5) and (5,2). How do these relate to the two 3s?\n\nThe point (2,5) is 3 units away from (3,3) (Manhattan distance of |2-3| + |5-3| = 1+2=3) and 3 units away from (4,4) (|2-4| + |5-4| =2+1=3). Similarly, (5,2) is also 3 units from both. So maybe 8s are placed in cells that are equidistant (Manhattan distance) to two 3s and at a certain distance.\n\nIn Example 0, the 3s are (3,2), (4,3), (6,7), (7,6). Let's see if the 8s are equidistant to pairs. Take (3,2) and (4,3). The midpoint would be (3.5, 2.5). The cell (3,2) and (4,3) are adjacent diagonally. The 8 at (2,4) is distance 2 from (3,2) (Manhattan 1+2=3) and distance 3 from (4,3) (2+1=3). So perhaps if two 3s are adjacent diagonally, the 8 is placed two steps in the opposite direction. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 8 is placed at a position that is the sum of the vectors of two 3s. For example, (3,2) and (4,3) \u2192 (3+4, 2+3) = (7,5). But in Example 0's output, there's an 8 at (5,5). Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each 3, the 8 is placed in a cell that forms a knight's move (chess knight) from the 3. A knight moves two in one direction and one in the other. For example, from (3,2), a knight move could be (2,4), which is one of the 8s in Example 0. From (4,3), a knight move could be (5,5), which is another 8. From (6,7), a knight move could be (5,5), which is already an 8. From (7,6), a knight move could be (8,8), which is the last 8. Oh, this seems to fit! So each 3 in the input has an 8 placed at a knight's move away. Let's check this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n3s at (3,2), (4,3), (6,7), (7,6).\n\nKnight moves:\n\nFrom (3,2): (3-1, 2+2) = (2,4) \u2192 which is an 8.\n\nFrom (4,3): (4+1,3+2) = (5,5) \u2192 yes, there's an 8 at (5,5).\n\nFrom (6,7): (6-1,7-2) = (5,5) \u2192 which is the same as above.\n\nFrom (7,6): (7+1,6+2) = (8,8) \u2192 yes, 8 at (8,8).\n\nBut wait, the 3 at (6,7) would have a knight move to (5,5), which is already covered by the 3 at (4,3). So that's why there's only one 8 at (5,5) but two 3s contributing to it. So the pattern is: For each 3 in the input, place an 8 at the cell that is two steps in one direction and one step in the other (knight's move), but possibly in a certain direction. \n\nIn Example 0, the 3 at (3,2) is moving up 1 and right 2. (3-1=2, 2+2=4). The 3 at (4,3) moves down 1 and right 2 (4+1=5, 3+2=5). The 3 at (6,7) moves up 1 and left 2 (6-1=5,7-2=5). The 3 at (7,6) moves down 1 and right 2 (7+1=8,6+2=8). So the direction of the knight's move varies.\n\nBut how to determine the direction for each 3? It seems that the direction is not fixed but depends on the position of the 3. For example, in Example 0, the 3s in the upper part move up and right or down and right, and the lower ones move up and left or down and right. So this might not be consistent. \n\nWait, perhaps the knight's move is always two steps to the right and one step up or down. Let's check. For (3,2): two right (col +2) and one up (row -1) \u2192 (2,4). That works. For (4,3): two right (3+2=5), one up (4-1=3 \u2192 (3,5). But there's no 8 there. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is such that the knight's move is two steps down and one step right. For (3,2): two down (3+2=5), one right (2+1=3 \u2192 (5,3). No 8 there. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This approach isn't working for all cases. Let's check Example 1.\n\nExample 1's input has 3s at:\n\n(3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4), (5,1), (5,2), (6,1), (6,2).\n\nApplying knight's move to each:\n\nFor (3,3): possible knight moves include (1,4), (2,5), (4,5), (5,4), etc. In the output, the 8s are at (1,0), (2,0), (7,5), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). None of these seem to correspond to knight moves from the 3s. For example, (3,3) moving two up and one left would be (1,2), which is not an 8. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nExample 2's input has 3s at (3,3) and (4,4). Applying knight moves:\n\nFrom (3,3): (1,4), (2,5), (4,5), (5,4), etc. The output has (2,5) and (5,2). (2,5) is a knight move from (3,3) (up 1, right 2). (5,2) is a knight move from (4,4) (down 1, left 2). So that fits.\n\nSo perhaps the direction varies depending on the position, but the knight's move is the pattern. But why in Example 1, the 8s are not at knight's move positions from the 3s?\n\nExample 1's output has 8s at (1,0), (2,0), (7,5), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). Let's see if those are knight's moves from any 3s.\n\nThe 3s are in rows3-4 cols3-4 and rows5-6 cols1-2.\n\nFor example, the 8 at (1,0). Let's see if any 3 is a knight's move away. For instance, a knight's move from (3,3) would require (3-2=1, 3-1=2 \u2192 (1,2)), which is not an 8. Or (3+1=4, 3-2=1 \u2192 (4,1), which is a 3 in row4, col3. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are knight's moves but in a different direction. For example, from the 3s in Example 1's input:\n\nTake (3,3). A knight's move of two left and one up would be (3-1=2, 3-2=1 \u2192 (2,1)). But there's no 8 there. \n\nThis suggests that the knight's move theory doesn't hold for Example 1. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for the 8s in the output and see if they are in positions that are centers of certain shapes formed by the 3s.\n\nIn Example 0, the 8s are positioned in a way that connects different clusters of 3s. The 8 at (5,1) might be between the upper and lower clusters, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output adds 8s at positions that form a certain pattern when you look at the entire grid. For example, the 8s are placed in cells that are not adjacent to any 3s but are in certain rows or columns.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 8s are in rows 2,5,8 and columns 1,4,5,8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are placed in cells that are in the same row or column as the 3s but offset by a certain amount. For Example 0, the 3s are in rows 3,4,6,7. The 8s are in rows 2,5,8. Which is one row above, one row below, etc. But not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are placed in cells that are in the same diagonal as the 3s but shifted.\n\nExample 2's 8s are on the same diagonal as the 3s but shifted. The 3s are on the main diagonal (3,3) and (4,4). The 8s are on (2,5) and (5,2), which are on a diagonal that's perpendicular.\n\nWait, (2,5) and (5,2) are on a diagonal that runs from (0,7) to (7,0), if the grid is 10x10. So perhaps the 8s are placed on the opposite diagonal.\n\nBut why would that be the case? Perhaps for each pair of 3s that form a diagonal, the 8s are placed on the perpendicular diagonal.\n\nIn Example 0, the 3s are in a diagonal from (3,2) to (4,3) and another diagonal from (6,7) to (7,6). The perpendicular diagonals would be from (3,2) \u2192 (2,3), but not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\nThe test input has 3s in two 3x3 blocks. One block is in rows 2-4, columns 6-8. The other block is in rows5-7, columns3-5. So two 3x3 squares.\n\nIf the pattern from Example 1 holds (where a 2x2 square of 3s generates 2x2 squares of 8s in opposite quadrants), then perhaps each 3x3 square of 3s would generate a larger structure of 8s. But the training examples don't have 3x3 squares, so I need to infer.\n\nAlternatively, applying the knight's move pattern from Example 0 and 2, each 3 in the test input would generate an 8 two cells in a certain direction. For example, for each 3 in the upper 3x3 block (rows2-4, cols6-8), the knight's move would be two cells left and one cell up. So for example, a 3 at (2,6) would generate an 8 at (0,7) (row 2-2=0, col6+1=7). Let's see if that's possible.\n\nBut the Test Input's 3s are in a 3x3 block:\n\nRows 2-4, cols6-8:\n\n(2,6), (2,7), (2,8),\n\n(3,6), (3,7), (3,8),\n\n(4,6), (4,7), (4,8).\n\nApplying knight's move two left and one up:\n\nFor (2,6): 2-1=1 row, 6-2=4 \u2192 (1,4). But that's not possible since 6-2=4. Wait, knight's move could be two in one direction and one in another. So from (2,6), two up and one left: row 2-2=0, col6-1=5 \u2192 (0,5). Or two left and one up: row 2-1=1, col6-2=4 \u2192 (1,4).\n\nBut without knowing the direction, it's hard to predict.\n\nAlternatively, each 3 in the test input's upper block would generate an 8 two cells down and one to the right. For (2,6) \u2192 (4,7), but that's within the 3s' block, which would already be a 3. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, for each 3, the knight's move is two cells down and two cells to the left. For (2,6): 2+2=4, 6-2=4 \u2192 (4,4). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, considering the Test Input's lower 3x3 block (rows5-7, cols3-5), perhaps each 3 there generates an 8 two cells to the right and two cells up. For example, a 3 at (5,3) would generate an 8 at (3,5).\n\nBut without a clear pattern from the training examples, this is uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, based on Example 1, where 2x2 squares of 3s generated 2x2 squares of 8s in opposite quadrants, perhaps the 3x3 squares in the test input will generate larger squares of 8s. For example, the upper-right 3x3 block would generate a 3x3 block of 8s in the lower-left quadrant, and the lower 3x3 block would generate 8s in the upper-right quadrant.\n\nLet me imagine that for the upper 3x3 block (rows2-4, cols6-8), the 8s are placed in rows5-7, cols0-2. And the lower 3x3 block (rows5-7, cols3-5) have 8s placed in rows0-2, cols6-8. That would mirror the positions across the grid's center.\n\nIn Example 1's test input, the output's 8s were in opposite quadrants. If this pattern holds, then applying it to the test input would result in 8s in the lower-left and upper-right quadrants.\n\nLet's check the Test Input:\n\nThe upper-right 3x3 block (rows2-4, cols6-8). The opposite quadrant would be lower-left (rows5-7, cols0-2). The lower 3x3 block (rows5-7, cols3-5) would have their opposite quadrant in upper-right (rows0-2, cols6-8).\n\nSo the output should have 3x3 blocks of 8s in those positions. But looking at the training examples, the 8s are individual or small groups. However, Example 1's output did have 2x2 blocks of 8s. So perhaps the Test Input's output will have 3x3 blocks of 8s in the opposite quadrants.\n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples? In Example 1, the 2x2 3s resulted in 2x2 8s. So perhaps the pattern is that each block of 3s (of size n x m) results in a block of 8s of the same size, placed in the opposite quadrant.\n\nIf that's the case, then the test input's upper-right 3x3 block would have a 3x3 block of 8s in the lower-left (rows5-7, cols0-2), and the lower 3x3 block would have a 3x3 block of 8s in the upper-right (rows0-2, cols6-8).\n\nLooking at the Test Input's structure:\n\nOriginal 3s are in:\n\nUpper block: rows2-4, cols6-8.\n\nLower block: rows5-7, cols3-5.\n\nOpposite quadrants would be:\n\nFor upper block: lower-left quadrant, rows5-7, cols0-2.\n\nFor lower block: upper-right quadrant, rows0-2, cols6-8.\n\nSo the output should have 3x3 blocks of 8s in those positions.\n\nLet me visualize the output grid:\n\nRows0-2, cols6-8: filled with 8s.\n\nRows5-7, cols0-2: filled with 8s.\n\nOther positions are 0.\n\nBut I need to check if this matches the training examples. For Example 1, the input's 3s were in two 2x2 blocks, and the output's 8s were in two 2x2 blocks in opposite quadrants. So this supports the pattern.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the test input:\n\nThe upper-right 3x3 block's 8s would be in the lower-left (rows5-7, cols0-2), and the lower-middle 3x3 block's 8s would be in the upper-right (rows0-2, cols6-8).\n\nBut wait, the lower 3x3 block is in rows5-7, cols3-5. Its opposite quadrant would be rows0-2, cols4-6 (if mirrored vertically) or rows0-2, cols6-8 if mirrored across the center.\n\nAlternatively, the opposite quadrant based on the grid center would be:\n\nFor a block in rows5-7 (which are below the center row 4.5) and cols3-5 (which are to the left of the center column 4.5), the opposite quadrant would be rows0-2 (above) and cols6-8 (right).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So each block is mirrored over the grid's center point (4.5,4.5). For a cell at (row, col), its mirror is (9-row, 9-col). Wait, no: mirroring across the center would be (9-row, 9-col). For example, (2,6) would be mirrored to (7,3). So a block in rows2-4, cols6-8 would be mirrored to rows5-7, cols1-3. Hmm, but the test input's lower block is in rows5-7, cols3-5. This may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, if each block's opposite is determined by flipping both row and column directions. For example, a block in rows2-4, cols6-8 (upper right) would have its mirror in rows5-7, cols1-3 (lower left). But the test input's lower block is in rows5-7, cols3-5, which is different.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's think of Example 1's input and output. The input had upper 3s in rows3-4, cols3-4. Their mirror across the center would be rows5-6, cols5-6. But in the output, the 8s are in rows1-2, cols0 and rows7-8, cols5-6. So not a direct mirror. So perhaps the mirroring is not the exact approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are placed in the corners of the grid. For Example 1, the 8s are in the top-left and bottom-right corners. The test input's upper 3s are in the upper-right, so their 8s would be in the lower-left, and the lower 3s are in the lower-middle, their 8s would be in the upper-right.\n\nSo the Test Input's output would have 8s in:\n\n- Lower-left: rows5-7, cols0-2 (mirror of upper-right 3s)\n\n- Upper-right: rows0-2, cols6-8 (mirror of lower-middle 3s)\n\nEach of these would be 3x3 blocks of 8s.\n\nBut in the training examples, the outputs don't have overlapping 8s, but the Test Input's output would have two 3x3 blocks of 8s in these positions.\n\nLet's confirm with the training examples:\n\nExample 1's input has upper 3s in rows3-4, cols3-4. Their mirror would be rows5-6, cols5-6. But the output has 8s in rows7-8, cols5-6. Not exactly mirrored. But in Example 1's output, the lower 8s are in rows7-8, cols5-6, which is two rows below the mirrored position.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are placed a certain distance away from the original 3s blocks. For Example 1's upper 3s (rows3-4, cols3-4), the 8s are in rows1-2, cols0-0 (two rows up, three cols left). The lower 3s (rows5-6, cols1-2), the 8s are in rows7-8, cols5-6 (two rows down, three cols right). So it's like each block of 3s has 8s shifted by two rows and three columns in a certain direction. For upper blocks, up and left; for lower blocks, down and right.\n\nApplying this to the test input's upper-right 3x3 block (rows2-4, cols6-8), shifting two rows up and three columns left would take them to rows0-2, cols3-5. But the output's upper-right would be rows0-2, cols6-8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, shifting the upper-right block down and left. But this is not clear.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that each block of 3s is shifted by a certain number of rows and columns to get the 8s. For Example 1's upper 3s (rows3-4, cols3-4), the 8s are shifted up by 2 rows and left by 3 columns to rows1-2, cols0-1. But Example 1's output has 8s in cols0 for rows1-2, not cols0-1. So only column 0. So it's a shift of left 3 and up 2.\n\nFor the lower 3s in Example 1 (rows5-6, cols1-2), the 8s are shifted down 2 rows and right 3 columns to rows7-8, cols4-5. But the output has cols5-6. So it's a shift of right 3 and down 2. So cols1+3=4, but output cols5-6. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nThis suggests that the shift might vary based on the position of the block. For example, upper blocks are shifted up and left, lower blocks shifted down and right.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input's upper-right 3x3 block (rows2-4, cols6-8), shifting up 2 and left 3 would result in rows0-2, cols3-5. But the expected 8s might be there. However, the lower 3x3 block (rows5-7, cols3-5) would be shifted down 2 and right 3 to rows7-9, cols6-8. But the grid has rows up to 9, so rows7-9 is possible. However, the output may have 8s in rows7-9, cols6-8. But in the Test Input's structure, the user provided input has rows up to 9 (0-based), so rows7-9 would be rows7,8,9. However, the Test Input's output may have 8s there.\n\nBut this is speculative. Given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern from the training examples, I'll have to make an educated guess based on Example 1's pattern where blocks of 3s generate blocks of 8s in opposite quadrants. So for the Test Input, the upper-right 3x3 block of 3s would generate a 3x3 block of 8s in the lower-left quadrant (rows5-7, cols0-2), and the lower-middle 3x3 block of 3s would generate a 3x3 block of 8s in the upper-right quadrant (rows0-2, cols6-8).\n\nThus, the output would look like:\n\nRows0-2, cols6-8: all 8s.\n\nRows5-7, cols0-2: all 8s.\n\nOther cells are 0.\n\nLet me check if this fits the format of the training examples. Example 1's output had 2x2 blocks of 8s, so this would be similar but larger.\n\nBut wait, looking at the training examples, the 8s are not overlapping with each other, even when multiple 3s contribute. For instance, in Example 0, two 3s contribute to the same 8 at (5,5). So in the Test Input, the 8s in the upper-right and lower-left blocks would each be 3x3, and possibly overlapping in some areas, but according to the problem statement, each 3 contributes to an 8. However, since the Test Input has two separate blocks of 3s, their corresponding 8 blocks would also be separate.\n\nThus, the final answer for the Test Input would have 8s in the two 3x3 blocks as described.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern between the input and output in these training examples. Let's start by looking at the first example. \n\nIn Example 0, the input has some 3s arranged in a diagonal pattern. The output introduces 8s. Looking at the positions of the 3s in the input: there's a 3 at (3,2) and (4,3), then (6,7) and (7,6). The output has 8s at (2,4), (5,1), (5,5), and (8,8). Hmm, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are midpoints between the 3s? Let me check.\n\nFor the first pair of 3s in Example 0: (3,2) and (4,3). The midpoint between these would be at row (3+4)/2=3.5 and column (2+3)/2=2.5. Since we can't have half indices, maybe it's rounded or adjacent. The output 8 is at (2,4) which doesn't seem directly between them. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong pairs.\n\nWait, maybe the 8s are placed in a different pattern. Let's look at the output rows. In Example 0's output, the 8s are at row 2, column 4; row 5, column 1 and 5; row 8, column 8. How does this relate to the input's 3s?\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 8s are placed where there's a certain number of 3s in the surrounding cells. Let's check the positions. For the 8 at (2,4) in the output: the input cells around it. Let's see the original input. The original input's row 3 has a 3 at column 2, row 4 has a 3 at column 3. The 8 is two rows above row 3? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions that form a cross or some symmetry relative to the 3s. For instance, the 3s in the input form a diagonal line, and the 8s are mirrored in some way. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input: there are blocks of 3s. The output has 8s in the first two rows on the left, and in the last two rows on the right. The input's 3s are in a square shape in the middle. The output 8s are placed at the top left and bottom right. Maybe the 8s are placed in the corners opposite to where the 3 clusters are. Or perhaps the 8s are placed in the directions where the 3s are expanding. \n\nWait, Example 1's input has 3s in a 2x2 block at (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4) and another 2x2 block at (5,1), (5,2), (6,1), (6,2). The output has 8s in rows 1 and 2 (left side), and rows 7 and 8 (right side). So maybe the 8s are placed at the edges opposite to the 3 clusters. For example, the upper 3 cluster is in rows 3-4, columns 3-4. The 8s above are in rows 1-2, columns 0-1. Similarly, the lower 3 cluster is in rows 5-6, columns 0-1. The 8s below are in rows 7-8, columns 5-6. So perhaps for each 3 cluster, the 8s are placed a certain distance away, maybe mirrored across the center of the grid.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has two 3s at (3,3) and (4,4). The output has 8s at (2,5) and (5,2). That looks like they are placed symmetrically relative to the diagonal of the 3s. The 3s form a diagonal from (3,3) to (4,4), and the 8s are at positions that are mirrored across that diagonal. So (2,5) and (5,2) are mirrored across the line y = x. Hmm, maybe for each pair of 3s, the 8s are placed in positions that are symmetric in some way.\n\nPutting this together, maybe the rule is that for each 3 in the input, an 8 is placed in a certain position relative to it. Alternatively, when 3s are adjacent, their 8s are placed in specific patterns. Let's look for more patterns.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0, the input 3s are in positions that form a diagonal. The output 8s are in positions that form a cross. For example, the 8 at (2,4) is two rows above the first 3, and the 8 at (5,1) is three rows below and two columns left. Maybe it's based on the number of 3s in the vicinity. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in cells that are equidistant from pairs of 3s. \n\nWait, in Example 0, the 8s could be the centers between pairs of 3s. Let's check:\n\n- The 3s at (3,2) and (4,3): midpoint is (3.5, 2.5). The nearest cell might be (3,2) or (4,3), but the output 8 is at (2,4). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the cells that would form a diamond shape around the 3s. For example, each 3 could generate 8s at positions one step up, down, left, right. But in Example 0, the 3 at (3,2) has 8s at (2,4) which is two rows up and two columns right. That doesn't fit. \n\nWait, looking at Example 2 again. The 3s are at (3,3) and (4,4). The 8s are at (2,5) and (5,2). The distance between (3,3) and (2,5) is sqrt( (1)^2 + (2)^2 ), which is sqrt(5). Similarly, (4,4) to (5,2) is same. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are placed in the same row or column as the 3s but shifted. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 8s are in rows 1 and 2, columns 0, and rows 7 and 8, columns 5 and 6. The input's upper 3s are in rows 3-4, columns 3-4. The 8s above are rows 1-2, columns 0-1. The lower 3s are in rows 5-6, columns 0-1. The 8s below are rows 7-8, columns 5-6. It seems like the 8s are placed in the corners opposite to the 3 clusters. For example, upper 3 cluster is in top-middle, so 8s are in top-left. Lower 3 cluster is in lower-left, so 8s are in lower-right. So perhaps the 8s are placed in the corners diagonally opposite to where the 3 clusters are, but mirrored.\n\nAnother thought: The number 8 is a rotated infinity symbol. Maybe the pattern is that 8s are placed where the 3s would be if the grid is rotated 180 degrees. Let's check. For Example 0, the 3s are in (3,2), (4,3), (6,7), (7,6). Rotating 180 degrees (since the grid is 10x10, the center is between (4.5,4.5)), the rotated positions would be (10 - 1 - row, 10 - 1 - col). So (3,2) becomes (6,7), which is one of the existing 3s. Similarly, (4,3) becomes (5,6). But the output 8s are in different positions. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s could be the sum of the 3s' positions in some way. For example, each 3's coordinates are added to another 3's coordinates, and the sum modulo 10 gives the position of 8. But in Example 0, (3,2) + (4,3) = (7,5), but there's an 8 at (5,1) and (2,4). Doesn't match.\n\nWait, let's look at the 8s in Example 0 again. The output has 8s at (2,4), (5,1), (5,5), (8,8). The input 3s are at (3,2), (4,3), (6,7), (7,6). Let's see the differences between 3 positions and 8 positions. For (3,2) \u2192 (2,4): row-1, column+2. (4,3) \u2192 (5,5): row+1, column+2. (6,7) \u2192 (5,5): row-1, column-2. (7,6) \u2192 (8,8): row+1, column+2. Hmm, inconsistent. Maybe there's a pattern based on the direction of the 3s.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s form a diamond shape around the 3s. For each 3, place 8s in a diamond pattern. But in Example 2, there's a single 3 at (3,3) and (4,4), and 8s at (2,5) and (5,2). That could be part of a diamond. Wait, (3,3) could have 8s at (3\u00b11,3\u00b12) or (3\u00b12,3\u00b11). For (3,3), (3+2,3-1) is (5,2), which is one of the 8s. (3-1,3+2) is (2,5), which is the other 8. Similarly for (4,4), (4+2,4-1)=6,3 \u2192 but in Example 2's output, there's no 8 there. Wait, maybe each 3 contributes to two 8s, but those positions might be overlapping or not present in other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the 3s are in blocks. For example, the upper block is rows 3-4, columns 3-4. The 8s are in rows 1-2, columns 0-1. So if each 3 in the upper block contributes to 8s in the top-left corner. Similarly, the lower 3s (rows 5-6, columns 0-1) have 8s in rows 7-8, columns 5-6. So maybe for each cluster of 3s, the 8s are placed in a specific direction away from the cluster. Like upper clusters have 8s above them, lower clusters have 8s below, but shifted.\n\nAlternatively, for each 3, the 8s are placed two cells away in the direction perpendicular to the cluster's orientation. For example, in Example 1, the upper 3s are a square. The 8s are placed two rows above and shifted left. The lower 3s are a square, and the 8s are two rows below and shifted right.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the upper 3 cluster is in columns 3-4. The 8s above are in columns 0-1. So three columns to the left. And the lower 3 cluster is in columns 0-1, the 8s are in columns 5-6, which is five columns to the right. Not sure. Maybe the distance is the same. Alternatively, mirrored over the vertical axis.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the output 8s as being at positions that form a certain geometric relationship with the 3s. For example, in Example 2, the two 3s form a diagonal. The 8s are placed such that they form a diamond shape around the 3s. So (3,3), (4,4) \u2192 8s at (2,5), (5,2) which are offset by (-1, +2) and (+1, -2). Similarly, perhaps each 3 has 8s placed in positions that are shifted in certain directions based on the 3's position.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are placed in cells that are knight's moves away from the 3s. A knight moves in L-shapes (2 in one direction, 1 in the other). For example, in Example 2, (3,3) to (2,5) is a knight move (up 1, right 2). Similarly, (3,3) to (5,2) is down 2, left 1. But not sure if this applies to all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's 3s: the upper cluster has 3s at (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4). If each of these places 8s via knight moves, but the output 8s are in rows 1-2, columns 0-1. Let's see: from (3,3), a knight move up 2 and left 3 would be (1,0), but that's not in the output. The actual 8s in Example 1's output are at (1,0), (2,0), (7,5), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). Hmm, perhaps the knight move idea isn't the right path.\n\nAnother angle: the output 8s are placed in positions that form a cross or a plus sign relative to the 3s. For Example 0's 3s, maybe the 8s are at the intersections of lines formed by the 3s. For example, the two diagonally placed 3s might create lines that intersect at an 8. But I'm not seeing a clear cross pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the 8s are placed at the midpoints between 3s. Let's check Example 2. The two 3s are at (3,3) and (4,4). The midpoint is (3.5,3.5), but the 8s are at (2,5) and (5,2). Maybe they are midpoints between pairs of 3s. But those positions don't seem to be midpoints. \n\nAlternatively, the 8s are placed in cells that are symmetric relative to the center of the grid. The center is at (4.5,4.5). For each 3, the 8 is placed at the position mirrored across the center. For example, in Example 0's (3,2), the mirrored position would be (6,7), which is another 3. So that doesn't explain the 8s. Hmm.\n\nAnother thought: the 8s are placed in cells that form a checkerboard pattern around the 3s. For example, if the 3s are on black squares, the 8s are on white squares a certain distance away. But without knowing the exact pattern, this is hard to confirm.\n\nLooking at all examples, the output 8s are placed in positions that are not overlapping with the input 3s. The number of 8s varies. Example 0 has four 8s, Example 1 has six 8s, Example 2 has two.\n\nWait, maybe the 8s are placed in all cells that have exactly two 3s in their adjacent cells (including diagonally). Let's check Example 2's 8s. The 8 at (2,5): what are the adjacent cells in the input? Let's see the original input for Example 2. The input 3s are at (3,3) and (4,4). The cell (2,5) is two rows above (3,3) and two columns to the right. The adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) of (2,5) would include (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,4), (2,6). None of these are 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are in cells that are exactly two steps away from a 3. Let's see Example 2's (2,5) is two steps right and one up from (3,3): that's three steps. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a reflection. For each 3, the 8 is placed in a position reflected across a certain axis. For example, in Example 2, the 3 at (3,3) has an 8 at (2,5), which is reflected over the line y = x + c. Not sure.\n\nLet me try to find a common transformation. Another approach: the output 8s are placed in positions where, if you draw lines between the 3s, the 8s are at certain intersections. For Example 0, the 3s form two diagonal lines. The 8s might be at the intersection points of perpendicular lines. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are placed in cells that form a certain shape relative to groups of 3s. For example, in Example 1, the 3s form two 2x2 squares, and the 8s form two 2x2 squares in the corners. Similarly, in Example 0, the 3s form two diagonal lines, and the 8s form a cross in the middle. Maybe the 8s form a shape that's rotated 90 degrees from the 3s' shape.\n\nAnother observation: the sum of the row and column indices of 3s and 8s. For Example 2's 3s: (3,3) sum 6, (4,4) sum 8. The 8s are at (2,5) sum 7, (5,2) sum 7. Not sure. But in Example 0, 3s' sums: (3,2) sum 5, (4,3) sum 7, (6,7) sum 13, (7,6) sum 13. The 8s' sums: (2,4) sum 6, (5,1) sum 6, (5,5) sum 10, (8,8) sum 16. Doesn't seem to follow a pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the positions of 8s relative to the 3s in Example 0:\n\n- (3,2) and (4,3) are diagonal. The 8s are at (2,4) which is up one and right two from (3,2), and (5,1) which is down one and left two from (4,3). Maybe each 3's 8 is placed in a direction that's perpendicular to the direction of the diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are placed such that each pair of 3s connected by a diagonal has 8s placed in a perpendicular direction. For example, in the diagonal of (3,2) to (4,3), the 8s are placed in a line perpendicular to that diagonal. The diagonal has a slope of 1 (since from (3,2) to (4,3) is up 1, right 1). A perpendicular slope would be -1. So the 8s could be along lines with slope -1. For (3,2), moving in the direction of slope -1 would take you to (2,3), but that's not where the 8 is. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, for each 3, the 8 is placed two steps in a certain direction. For example, in Example 0, (3,2) \u2192 (2,4) is up one row and right two columns. (4,3) \u2192 (5,5) is down one row and right two. (6,7) \u2192 (5,5) is up one and left two. (7,6) \u2192 (8,8) is down one and right two. It seems like for each 3, the 8 is placed in a direction that is either up and right, down and right, up and left, or down and left, but varying. But I can't see a consistent pattern here.\n\nWait, perhaps the 8s are placed such that they form a diamond around the 3 clusters. For Example 1, the upper 3s form a 2x2 square. The 8s form a 2x2 square in the upper left. The distance between the upper 3 cluster and the upper 8s is two rows up and three columns left. The lower 3 cluster is two rows above the lower 8s, and shifted right by four columns. This might suggest that the 8s are placed at a certain offset from the 3 clusters. But the offset seems inconsistent between examples.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are placed in the positions that are farthest from the 3s. For instance, in Example 1, the 3 clusters are in the middle and lower left, and the 8s are in the upper left and lower right. So perhaps the 8s are placed at the corners furthest from the 3 clusters.\n\nAnother approach: think about the 8s as being in the 'shadow' of the 3s when light is cast from a certain direction. For example, if light is coming from the top-left, each 3 would cast a shadow to the bottom-right, and the 8s are where the shadows overlap. But this is vague.\n\nLet's try to find a rule that applies to all examples. For each example, the output introduces 8s in positions that are somehow related to the input's 3s. The key is to find the relationship that holds for all training examples.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput 3s:\nRow 3, column 2\nRow 4, column 3\nRow 6, column 7\nRow 7, column 6\n\nOutput 8s:\nRow 2, column 4\nRow 5, column 1\nRow 5, column 5\nRow 8, column 8\n\nLooking for a pattern here. The first two 3s form a diagonal going down-right. The output has 8s above and below. The next two 3s form a diagonal going up-right, and the output has 8s in a line between them?\n\nAlternatively, each 3 has an 8 placed two cells away in a specific direction. For example:\n\nRow 3, column 2 \u2192 8 at row 2, column 4 (up 1, right 2)\nRow 4, column 3 \u2192 8 at row 5, column 1 (down 1, left 2)\nRow 6, column 7 \u2192 8 at row 5, column 5 (up 1, left 2)\nRow 7, column 6 \u2192 8 at row 8, column 8 (down 1, right 2)\n\nHmm, the directions vary. Up-right, down-left, up-left, down-right. But the pattern here is that for each 3, the 8 is placed in a direction that's two steps right or left and one step up or down, forming an L-shape like a knight's move. For example, (3,2) \u2192 (2,4) is knight's move (left 1, up 2?), or (right 2, up 1). Wait, a knight moves two in one direction and one in the other. So (3,2) to (2,4) is moving up 1 (row decreases by 1) and right 2 (column increases by 2), which is a knight's move. Similarly, (4,3) \u2192 (5,1) is down 1 (row increases by 1), left 2 (column decreases by 2), which is a knight's move. (6,7) \u2192 (5,5): up 1, left 2. (7,6) \u2192 (8,8): down 1, right 2. So all these 8s are a knight's move away from the 3s. \n\nNow, checking Example 2's 3s: (3,3) and (4,4). The 8s are at (2,5) and (5,2). For (3,3), a knight's move up 1 and right 2 would be (2,5). For (4,4), a knight's move down 1 and left 2 would be (5,2). Yes! That fits. So each 3 has an 8 placed at two knight's move positions. Wait, but in Example 0, each 3 has one 8. Wait, no. Example 0 has four 3s and four 8s. Each 3 contributes one 8. So the rule might be: for each 3 in the input, place an 8 at the position that is a knight's move in a certain direction. But which direction?\n\nIn Example 0, the knight's directions vary. For (3,2), it's up 1, right 2. For (4,3), it's down 1, left 2. For (6,7), up 1, left 2. For (7,6), down 1, right 2. The directions are opposite for each pair. Maybe when two 3s are adjacent or form a certain pattern, their 8s are placed in opposite knight directions.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 3s in blocks. Let's take one 3 from the upper block: say (3,3). A knight's move from there would be (4,5), (5,4), etc. But the output 8s are in (1,0), (2,0), (7,5), etc. Those are not knight's moves. Wait, perhaps for blocks of 3s, the knight's move direction is determined by the block's position. For example, the upper block is in the middle, so the knight's moves are up-left. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, Example 1's input has 3s at (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4). Let's take one 3: (3,3). A knight's move up-left would be (1,2), which isn't an 8 in the output. But the output has 8s at (1,0) and (2,0). That's two knight moves left and two knight moves up? Alternatively, maybe each 3 in a cluster contributes to an 8 in a certain direction, and when multiple 3s are clustered, their 8s overlap.\n\nAlternatively, the direction of the knight's move depends on the cluster's orientation. For example, in Example 0's diagonal 3s, the directions are alternating. In Example 1's square 3s, maybe the knight's moves are all in the same direction for each 3 in the cluster. But how?\n\nHmm, this approach seems to work for Examples 0 and 2, but not clearly for Example 1. Let's re-examine Example 1's output. The input has two 2x2 blocks of 3s. The output has two 2x2 blocks of 8s in the upper left and lower right. For each 3 in the upper block (rows 3-4, columns 3-4), the knight's move to the upper left would be (row-2, column-3), which for (3,3) gives (1,0). For (3,4), (1,1). But in the output, the upper 8s are at (1,0) and (2,0). Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the knight's move direction is determined by the position of the 3 relative to the cluster's center. For example, the upper cluster's center is at (3.5, 3.5). Each 3 in the cluster could contribute an 8 in a direction away from the center. For (3,3), which is to the left and up of the center, the knight's move would be left and up. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the knight's move direction is consistent for all 3s. For example, always up two and left one. Let's check. For Example 0's (3,2): up two would be row 1, left one column 1. But the output has (2,4). Doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to hypothesize the rule as: for each 3 in the input, place an 8 at the position that is a knight's move away (two in one direction and one in the other), but the direction depends on the 3's position. For example, if the 3 is in an even row, move up-right; if odd row, move down-left. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is based on the parity of the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if (row + column) is even, move in one direction; if odd, another. Let's check Example 2's 3 at (3,3) sum 6 (even). The 8 is at (2,5) which sum 7 (odd). If the knight's move direction is based on parity, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is such that the 8s form a symmetrical pattern. For Example 0, the 8s are placed in a way that the entire output is symmetrical. The 8s at (2,4) and (8,8) are mirrored across the center. Similarly, (5,1) and (5,5) are mirrored. So perhaps the rule is to place 8s in knight's move positions that create symmetry.\n\nBut how to apply this to the test input? Let's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0]\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0]\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0]\nRow 5: [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]\nRow 6: [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]\nRow 7: [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 3s form two blocks. Upper block is rows 2-4, columns 6-8 (3x3), lower block is rows 5-7, columns 3-5 (3x3).\n\nFollowing the knight's move pattern from previous examples, each 3 in these blocks should have an 8 placed a knight's move away. But what direction?\n\nIf we consider each 3 in the upper block, perhaps their knight's moves would be in certain directions. For example, the upper block is on the right side. So the knight's moves could be to the upper-right and lower-right. But the output needs to be symmetrical.\n\nAlternatively, for the upper block (right side), the 8s are placed to the left, and for the lower block (left side), the 8s are placed to the right.\n\nBut this is speculation. Let's try to apply the knight's move idea to one 3. Take the 3 at (2,6) (row 2, column 6). A knight's move could be up two, left one: (0,5). Or up one, left two: (1,4). Or other combinations. But the output might have 8s in positions that are knight's moves from multiple 3s.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are placed in positions that are knight's moves from all surrounding 3s. For example, if a cell is a knight's move away from two or more 3s, place an 8 there. \n\nIn Example 0, the 8 at (5,5) is a knight's move away from both (6,7) and (4,3). Let's check:\n\n(6,7) to (5,5): up 1, left 2 \u2192 knight's move.\n(4,3) to (5,5): down 1, right 2 \u2192 knight's move.\nYes, so this 8 is a knight's move from two 3s. Similarly, in Example 2, the 8 at (5,2) is a knight's move from (4,4) (down 1, left 2) and from (3,3) (up 2, left 1). Wait, no. (3,3) to (5,2) is down 2, left 1 \u2192 which is a knight's move (two down, one left). So in Example 2, each 8 is a knight's move from one 3. But in Example 0, some 8s are knight's moves from two 3s.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: place an 8 in every cell that is a knight's move away from at least one 3. But in Example 0, there are four 3s, and each would generate two knight's move positions. But the output has four 8s, so maybe only one knight's move per 3. \n\nWait, each 3 can generate up to eight knight's move positions (eight possible directions). But in the examples, each 3 is only generating one 8. So the rule must select a specific knight's move direction per 3.\n\nLooking at the direction of knight's moves in the examples:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- (3,2) \u2192 (2,4) (up 1, right 2)\n- (4,3) \u2192 (5,1) (down 1, left 2)\n- (6,7) \u2192 (5,5) (up 1, left 2)\n- (7,6) \u2192 (8,8) (down 1, right 2)\n\nThe directions here seem to alternate: up-right, down-left, up-left, down-right. Maybe the direction is determined by the position's parity or some other factor.\n\nAnother possibility: the direction is chosen based on the row of the 3. For even rows, move up-right; for odd rows, move down-left. Let's see:\n\n- (3,2) is row 3 (odd). But it moved up-right. That doesn't fit. \n- (4,3) is even row. Moved down-left. \nHmm, not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is determined by the column. For even columns, move right; odd columns, move left. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the direction is determined such that the 8s form a pattern that mirrors the 3s' arrangement. For example, if the 3s form a diagonal going down-right, the 8s form a diagonal going down-left.\n\nBut this is vague. Let's think about the test input. The upper block of 3s is a 3x3 square in rows 2-4, columns 6-8. The lower block is a 3x3 square in rows 5-7, columns 3-5. According to the previous examples, each 3 would generate an 8 in a knight's move direction. If each 3 in the upper block generates an 8 two to the left and one down, then the 8s would be in columns 4-6, rows 3-5. But that's overlapping with the lower 3 block. Alternatively, for upper 3s, knight's move up-left would place 8s in rows 0-2, columns 4-6. But the test input's rows are 0-9, so rows 0-2 are available.\n\nSimilarly, the lower 3 block is in rows 5-7, columns 3-5. If each 3 here generates an 8 two to the right and one up, the 8s would be in columns 5-7, rows 4-6. But this overlaps with the upper 3 block. Alternatively, knight's move down-right would place 8s in rows 6-8, columns 5-7.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's try to apply the knight's move direction from Example 0. For example, each 3 in a diagonal generates an 8 in a knight's move. For the upper 3x3 block, perhaps each 3 generates an 8 two to the left and one up. Let's take a 3 at (2,6). Knight's move up 1 and left 2 would be row 1, column 4. Another 3 at (2,7) would generate row 1, column 5. Another at (2,8): row 1, column 6. Similarly, row 3's 3s would generate knight's moves to row 2, columns 4-6. Row 4's 3s would generate knight's moves to row 3, columns 4-6. But this would create a 3x3 block of 8s in rows 1-3, columns 4-6. But looking at the training examples, when there's a block of 3s, the 8s form blocks in the corners (like Example 1). \n\nAlternatively, the knight's move direction for each 3 in the upper block is up and left, leading to 8s in the upper-left corner. For the lower block, the knight's move is down and right, leading to 8s in the lower-right corner.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the upper 3 block is in rows 3-4, columns 3-4. The output has 8s in rows 1-2, columns 0-1. So for each 3 in the upper block, the knight's move could be up 2 and left 3. For example, (3,3) \u2192 (1,0), (3,4) \u2192 (1,1), (4,3) \u2192 (2,0), (4,4) \u2192 (2,1). That matches the output. Similarly, the lower 3 block is rows 5-6, columns 0-1. For each 3 here, knight's move down 2 and right 3: (5,0) \u2192 (7,3), (5,1) \u2192 (7,4), (6,0) \u2192 (8,3), (6,1) \u2192 (8,4). But the output has 8s in rows 7-8, columns 5-6. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Unless the knight's move is different.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the lower 8s are at (7,5), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). If the lower 3s are at (5,0), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1), a knight's move of down 2 and right 5 would be impossible. Alternatively, perhaps it's down 1 and right 4. For example, (5,0) \u2192 (6,4), (5,1) \u2192 (6,5). But the output's 8s are at columns 5-6 in rows 7-8. Not matching.\n\nThis suggests that the knight's move idea might not hold for Example 1. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the upper 3 block has 8s placed two rows above and three columns to the left. The lower 3 block has 8s placed two rows below and four columns to the right. Maybe the displacement is based on the cluster's position. For example, upper cluster's displacement is (-2, -3), lower cluster's displacement is (+2, +4). But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are placed in the same relative position to the cluster as the cluster is to the grid's center. For example, the upper cluster is in the middle, so the 8s are placed towards the top-left. But this is vague.\n\nLet me think differently. The 8s are placed in positions that are the same distance and direction from the center as the 3s. For example, if a 3 is in the upper-right quadrant, the 8 is placed in the lower-left quadrant. But this doesn't fit Example 0's 3s which are in the middle and upper parts.\n\nAnother approach: the number 8 might represent the sum of the number of 3s in a certain pattern around the cell. For example, if a cell is surrounded by two 3s in a knight's move position, it becomes 8. But in Example 0, the 8 at (5,5) has two 3s knight's move away. The 8 at (2,4) has one 3 knight's move away. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, 8 is the sum of the distances from the cell to nearby 3s. But that's unlikely.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll try to synthesize a rule based on the knight's move idea for the test input. \n\nFor each 3 in the test input, place an 8 at a knight's move position. The direction of the knight's move depends on the position of the 3. For example, if the 3 is in the upper block (right side), move left and up. If in the lower block (left side), move right and down. \n\nIn the test input's upper block (rows 2-4, columns 6-8), each 3 would generate an 8 two to the left and one up. For example, (2,6) \u2192 (0,5), (2,7) \u2192 (0,6), (2,8) \u2192 (0,7). Similarly, row 3: (3,6) \u2192 (1,5), (3,7) \u2192 (1,6), (3,8) \u2192 (1,7). Row 4: (4,6) \u2192 (2,5), (4,7) \u2192 (2,6), (4,8) \u2192 (2,7). This would create a block of 8s in rows 0-2, columns 5-7.\n\nFor the lower block (rows 5-7, columns 3-5), each 3 would generate an 8 two to the right and one down. For example, (5,3) \u2192 (7,5), (5,4) \u2192 (7,6), (5,5) \u2192 (7,7). Row 6: (6,3) \u2192 (8,5), (6,4) \u2192 (8,6), (6,5) \u2192 (8,7). Row 7: (7,3) \u2192 (9,5), (7,4) \u2192 (9,6), (7,5) \u2192 (9,7). This would create a block of 8s in rows 7-9, columns 5-7.\n\nBut the test input's output has to fit within 10 rows and columns. So rows 0-9 and columns 0-9. So the upper block's 8s would be in rows 0-2, columns 5-7, and the lower block's 8s in rows 7-9, columns 5-7. \n\nLooking at the training examples, Example 1's output has 8s in the upper-left and lower-right corners. The test input's 8s would be in upper-left (rows 0-2, columns 5-7) and lower-right (rows 7-9, columns 5-7). But that's not exactly corners, but middle of the top and bottom.\n\nBut in the training examples, the output for Example 1 has 8s in the upper-left and lower-right. So perhaps the test input's output will have 8s in those areas.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are placed in the same relative positions as the clusters. The upper cluster is in the upper-right, so the 8s are in the upper-left. The lower cluster is in the lower-left, so the 8s are in the lower-right. \n\nSo for the test input:\n\n- Upper cluster (rows 2-4, columns 6-8): 8s placed in rows 0-2, columns 0-2 (upper-left).\n- Lower cluster (rows 5-7, columns 3-5): 8s placed in rows 7-9, columns 7-9 (lower-right).\n\nBut how to derive this from the training examples. Example 1's upper cluster is in rows 3-4, columns 3-4, and the 8s are in rows 1-2, columns 0-1. So shifted two rows up and three columns left. Similarly, lower cluster in rows 5-6, columns 0-1, and 8s in rows 7-8, columns 5-6: shifted two rows down and five columns right. So the displacement is different based on the cluster's position.\n\nBut for the test input's upper cluster (columns 6-8), shifting left three columns would reach columns 3-5. Rows 0-2. Not sure. \n\nAnother way: the 8s for the upper cluster are placed in the upper-left corner, and for the lower cluster in the lower-right corner. So for the test input, upper cluster's 8s would be in rows 0-2, columns 0-2, and lower's in rows 7-9, columns 7-9. But this doesn't fit Example 1's output, where the lower 3s are in columns 0-1 and their 8s are in columns 5-6. So maybe the displacement is based on the cluster's size.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are placed in such a way that each cluster's 8s form a square of the same size, but displaced. For Example 1, the upper 3 cluster is 2x2, and the 8s are 2x2. The lower 3 cluster is 2x2, and the 8s are 2x2. For the test input's 3x3 clusters, the 8s would be 3x3 blocks displaced in certain directions.\n\nFor the upper 3x3 cluster (rows 2-4, columns 6-8), the 8s might be placed three columns to the left and two rows up: rows 0-2, columns 3-5. For the lower 3x3 cluster (rows 5-7, columns 3-5), the 8s might be placed three columns to the right and two rows down: rows 7-9, columns 6-8. \n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples? In Example 1, the upper cluster is shifted two rows up and three columns left. The lower cluster is shifted two rows down and five columns right. The displacement varies, but perhaps it's based on the cluster's position. \n\nAssuming the test input's upper cluster (columns 6-8) would have 8s shifted left by (columns - some value). For example, moving left by 3 columns and up 2 rows. That would place them in columns 3-5, rows 0-2. Similarly, the lower cluster (columns 3-5) would shift right by 3 columns and down 2 rows: columns 6-8, rows 7-9.\n\nThis results in two 3x3 blocks of 8s in the upper-middle-left and lower-middle-right. \n\nLooking back to the training examples, Example 1's output has upper 8s in columns 0-1 and lower in 5-6. So displacement varies.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are placed in the opposite quadrant of the grid relative to the 3 cluster. For example, upper-right 3 cluster \u2192 lower-left 8s, but that doesn't fit the training examples. Example 1's upper cluster is in the middle, and the 8s are in the upper-left. \n\nThis is getting too vague. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the knight's move hypothesis. For each 3 in the test input, place an 8 two cells to the left and one cell up. For example, a 3 at (2,6) would have an 8 at (0,5). Applying this to all 3s in the upper block:\n\nUpper block 3s are at rows 2-4, columns 6-8. Each 3 here would generate an 8 two to the left and one up. So:\n\nRow 2, columns 6-8: 8s at (0,4-6)\nRow 3, columns 6-8: 8s at (1,4-6)\nRow 4, columns 6-8: 8s at (2,4-6)\n\nSimilarly, lower block 3s are at rows 5-7, columns 3-5. For each 3 here, generate an 8 two to the right and one down:\n\nRow 5, columns 3-5: 8s at (7,5-7)\nRow 6, columns 3-5: 8s at (8,5-7)\nRow 7, columns 3-5: 8s at (9,5-7)\n\nThis would result in 3x3 blocks of 8s at rows 0-2, columns 4-6 and rows 7-9, columns 5-7. However, looking at the training examples, the outputs don't have overlapping 8s from multiple 3s. But this could be possible.\n\nBut according to Example 1, when multiple 3s are clustered, their 8s form a cluster as well. So the test input's output would have two 3x3 blocks of 8s in the upper-middle and lower-middle. \n\nChecking the knight's move for the lower block:\n\nTake a 3 at (5,3). Two right and one down would be (6,5). But row 5+1=6, column 3+2=5. So yes. Another 3 at (5,4) \u2192 (6,6), etc. So for lower block 3s, the 8s would be at rows 6-8, columns 5-7. \n\nSo combining both upper and lower 8 blocks:\n\nUpper 8s:\n\nRows 0-2, columns 4-6:\n\n[0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nLower 8s:\n\nRows 6-8, columns 5-7:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0]\n\nBut the rows 6-8 would overlap with the lower block's 8s. Wait, the test input's lower 3s are in rows 5-7, columns 3-5. Their knight's moves would be to rows 6-8, columns 5-7. So rows 6-8 are available. So the lower 8s would be in rows 6-8, columns 5-7. \n\nThe upper 8s are in rows 0-2, columns 4-6. \n\nThe final output would have 8s in these positions. Let's format the test output accordingly:\n\nThe test output would have 8s in rows 0-2, columns 4-6 and rows 6-8, columns 5-7. Let's construct each row:\n\nRow 0: all zeros except columns 4-6 are 8 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: same as row 0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: same \u2192 [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: all zeros except for the input's 3s \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0]\n\nRow 4: same as input \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0]\n\nRow 5: input's 3s \u2192 [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: input's 3s \u2192 [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: input's 3s \u2192 [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: output's lower 8s \u2192 columns 5-7 are 8 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,3,8,8,8,0,0] Wait, no. The input's row 6 has 3s in columns 3-5. The output's row 6 should have 8s in columns 5-7. But the input's 3s are still present. According to the training examples, the 3s remain in the output. For example, in Example 0, the input's 3s are still present in the output. So the 8s are added to the existing 3s.\n\nSo in the test output, the 3s remain where they are, and the 8s are added in the knight's move positions. So row 6 would have 3s in columns 3-5 and 8s in 5-7. So columns 5 would have both 3 and 8? No, that's impossible. Wait, no. Each cell is either 0, 3, or 8. So if a cell has a 3 in the input, it remains 3 in the output. The 8s are placed in cells that were 0 in the input. So for row 6, columns 3-5 are 3s (from input), columns 5-7 are 8s. Wait, column 5 would be 3 in the input (from row 6, column 5 is part of the lower 3 block). So the 8s in columns 5-7 would only be in columns 5 if the input's column 5 has a 0. But in row 6, column 5 is 3. So the knight's move for the lower block's 3s would be placed in cells that were originally 0.\n\nAh, right. So in the test input's row 5, columns 3-5 are 3s. Their knight's move (two right, one down) would be row 6, columns 5-7. But row 6, columns 3-5 are 3s. So columns 5 in row 6 is a 3, not an 8. Therefore, the 8s would be in columns 5-7, but only where the input is 0. So for row 6, the 8s would be in columns 5-7 only if those cells are 0. But in the input, columns 6-7 in row 6 are 0, column 5 is 3. So row 6's 8s would be in columns 6-7. \n\nSimilarly, row 5's 3s at columns 3-5: knight's move two right and one down would be columns 5-7 and row 6. But columns 5 in row 6 is a 3, so 8s are only placed in columns 6-7 of row 6. \n\nThis complicates things. Let's re-calculate the 8s for the test input.\n\nFor each 3 in the upper block (rows 2-4, columns 6-8):\n\n- 3 at (2,6): knight's move up 1, left 2 \u2192 (1,4)\n- 3 at (2,7): knight's move up 1, left 2 \u2192 (1,5)\n- 3 at (2,8): knight's move up 1, left 2 \u2192 (1,6)\n- 3 at (3,6): knight's move up 1, left 2 \u2192 (2,4)\n- 3 at (3,7): knight's move up 1, left 2 \u2192 (2,5)\n- 3 at (3,8): knight's move up 1, left 2 \u2192 (2,6)\n- 3 at (4,6): knight's move up 1, left 2 \u2192 (3,4)\n- 3 at (4,7): knight's move up 1, left 2 \u2192 (3,5)\n- 3 at (4,8): knight's move up 1, left 2 \u2192 (3,6)\n\nThese 8s would be placed in rows 1-3, columns 4-6.\n\nFor the lower block (rows 5-7, columns 3-5):\n\n- 3 at (5,3): knight's move down 1, right 2 \u2192 (6,5)\n- 3 at (5,4): knight's move down 1, right 2 \u2192 (6,6)\n- 3 at (5,5): knight's move down 1, right 2 \u2192 (6,7)\n- 3 at (6,3): knight's move down 1, right 2 \u2192 (7,5)\n- 3 at (6,4): knight's move down 1, right 2 \u2192 (7,6)\n- 3 at (6,5): knight's move down 1, right 2 \u2192 (7,7)\n- 3 at (7,3): knight's move down 1, right 2 \u2192 (8,5)\n- 3 at (7,4): knight's move down 1, right 2 \u2192 (8,6)\n- 3 at (7,5): knight's move down 1, right 2 \u2192 (8,7)\n\nThese 8s would be placed in rows 6-8, columns 5-7.\n\nNow, check if these positions are 0 in the input. For example, (1,4) in the input is 0. So it becomes 8. (1,5) is 0 \u2192 8. (1,6) is 0 \u2192 8. Similarly, (2,4) is 0 \u2192 8, (2,5) is 0 \u2192 8, (2,6) is 0 \u2192 8. \n\nFor the lower block's 8s: (6,5) is in the input's row 6, column 5, which is 3 \u2192 stays 3. So the knight's move from (5,5) is (6,7), which is 0 \u2192 8. \n\nSo the lower block's 8s are at:\n\n(6,5): 3 \u2192 remains 3, no 8.\n\n(6,6): 0 \u2192 8.\n\n(6,7): 0 \u2192 8.\n\n(7,5): 0 \u2192 8.\n\n(7,6): 0 \u2192 8.\n\n(7,7): 0 \u2192 8.\n\n(8,5): 0 \u2192 8.\n\n(8,6): 0 \u2192 8.\n\n(8,7): 0 \u2192 8.\n\nSo the lower block's 8s are in rows 6-8, columns 5-7, but not overwriting the existing 3s.\n\nThus, the output will have:\n\n- Upper 8s in rows 1-3, columns 4-6.\n- Lower 8s in rows 6-8, columns 5-7.\n\nConstructing each row:\n\nRow 0: all zeros except no 8s \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: columns 4-6 are 8 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: columns 4-6 are 8 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: columns 4-6 are 8 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0] but original input's row 3 has 3s in columns 6-8. So row 3 becomes [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,3,3,3,0] (but rows are 0-based). Wait, original row 3 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0]. So after adding 8s:\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,3,3,3,0] \u2192 but columns 4-6 are 8, and columns 6-8 are 3. So column 6 would be 8 from the knight's move and 3 from the input. Wait, no. Each cell can't be both. The original input's row 3, column 6 is 3. So the 8s are placed in cells that were 0. So in row 3, columns 4-6: 8, 8, 8. Columns 6-8 are 3s. So row 3 becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,8,8,8,3,3,3]\n\nWait, the input for row 3 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0]. So columns 6-8 are 3s. So when placing the 8s in columns 4-6 (which are 0 in the input), they become 8. So row 3 becomes:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 0]\n\nWait, the input's row 3 has column 9 as 0. So the output row 3 would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 0]\n\nSimilarly, row 4: input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0]. Knight's move 8s are in columns 4-6 (0s in input), so row 4 becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,8,8,8,3,3,0]\n\nRows 5-7 have their own 3s and 8s. For row 6, the knight's move from lower block 3s:\n\nRow 6's 8s are columns 5-7. Original row 6 is [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]. So columns 5 is 3 (part of input), columns 6-7 are 0. So knight's move 8s are placed in columns 6-7. So row 6 becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,3,3,3,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow 7: input is [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]. Knight's move 8s are columns 5-7, but columns 5 is 3. So 8s are placed in columns 6-7 \u2192 [0,0,0,3,3,3,8,8,0,0].\n\nRow 8: input is all zeros. Knight's move 8s are columns 5-7 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0].\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,3,3,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,3,3,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0] (no 8s here)\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,3,3,3,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,3,3,3,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis seems to fit the pattern from the training examples where each 3 generates an 8 via a knight's move. However, the upper 8s are in a 3x3 block and the lower in a 3x3 block, but shifted.",
