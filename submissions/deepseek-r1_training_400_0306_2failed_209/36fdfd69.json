        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of numbers, and the output seems to modify some of those numbers. Let me start by comparing the input and output of each example.\n\nStarting with Example 0. Let's look at the first input and output pair. The input is [1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1], and the output is the same. Hmm, so maybe some lists don't change. Then in the second input, the input is [1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0], and the output changes some 1s to 4s. Like the third element was 2 and stayed 2, but the fourth element becomes 4. Wait, looking at the output for that row: the fourth element is 4, and the next few elements (positions 4-9) are 4s. But in the input, positions 4-9 are 1s. So maybe when there's a sequence of 1s following a 2, they get converted to 4s? Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has an 8, and some 8s are changed to 4s in the output. For instance, in the fourth input row of Example 1, the input is [0,0,2,8,2,2,2,8,0,0,0,2,8,2,8,0], and the output changes the 8s after the 2 to 4s. Like the fourth element becomes 4, and the 8 at position 13 becomes 4. Wait, the pattern here might be that when a number (like 2 or another) is followed by a sequence of the same number (maybe 8s or 1s), those are converted to 4s. Or maybe it's when a lower number is followed by higher numbers. Wait, in Example 0, the first change is in the second input row where a 1 is followed by a 2, then a 1, and the output replaces some 1s with 4s. Hmm, perhaps the rule is that when a 2 is present, the following consecutive same numbers are replaced by 4s. Wait, maybe it's about runs of the same number after a 2. Let's look closer.\n\nIn Example 0, second input row: [1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0]. The output becomes [1,1,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0]. Here, after the 2, there are six 1s which all become 4s. So the rule could be that whenever there's a 2 in the list, the consecutive same numbers immediately following it (here 1s) are replaced with 4s. Similarly, in Example 1, fourth input row: [0,0,2,8,2,2,2,8,0,0,0,2,8,2,8,0], the output is [0,0,2,4,2,2,2,8,0,0,0,2,4,2,8,0]. So after the first 2, the 8 becomes 4. Then, after the next 2, the 8 becomes 4 again. Wait, but there's a 2 followed by 8, which becomes 4. But in Example 2, let's check. For instance, in the fifth input row of Example 2: [0,3,3,2,2,3,3,2,0,0,0,3,3,0], the output becomes [0,3,3,2,2,4,4,2,0,0,0,3,3,0]. So the 3s following the 2s are changed to 4s. So the pattern seems to be: whenever there's a 2, the subsequent consecutive numbers (of the same value as the ones before the 2) are converted to 4. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe whenever a 2 is present, the numbers immediately after it (regardless of their value) are turned into 4s up to a certain point. Or perhaps it's about runs of the same number that are adjacent to a 2. \n\nWait, looking at the first example where a 2 is followed by 1s which become 4s. Then in Example 1, the third input row: [0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,8,2,8,0] becomes [0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,4,4,2,8,0]. So the 8s after the 2 (position 13) are turned into 4s. Wait, in the input, the 8 at position 11 becomes 4, and the next 8 at position 12 becomes 4. Then the 2 is followed by an 8, which becomes 8 in the output. Wait, no, the 2 is at position 13 in the input? Let me check again. Input is [0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,8,2,8,0]. The output changes the 8s at positions 11 and 12 (0-based index?) to 4s. So before the 2, there are two 8s, which become 4s. So maybe the rule is that whenever a 2 is encountered in the list, the previous consecutive same numbers are turned into 4s. But that doesn't fit the first example. Wait in the first example, the 2 is followed by 1s. So maybe the 2 is a marker, and the following consecutive same digits (same as the number before the 2?) are turned into 4s. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, second input row: the sequence is 1,1,2, then 1s. The 2 is between 1s, so the 1s after the 2 are turned into 4s. Similarly, in Example 1's fourth input row: after the 2, there's an 8, which is turned into 4. Then another 2, followed by 2s (they stay the same?), then another 2 followed by 8, which becomes 4. So perhaps when a number comes after a 2 and is the same as the number before the 2, they are turned into 4. For example, in the second example's fifth row: input is [0,3,3,2,2,3,3,2,0,0,0,3,3,0]. The 2s are followed by 3s. The 3s after the 2s are turned into 4s. So the first 3 after the 2s becomes 4. Wait, but in the input, after the two 2s, there are two 3s. In the output, those two 3s become 4s. So maybe whenever there's a 2, the next occurrences of the same number that was before the 2 are turned into 4s. Let's check:\n\nIn the first example, second input row: before the 2 (position 2) is 1. The numbers after the 2 are 1s. They are turned into 4s. In the same example's third input row: [1,1,1,2,1,2,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0]. The output is [1,1,4,2,4,2,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0]. So here, the 2 is at position 3. The number before it is 1 (position 2 is 1). Then the next number after the 2 is 1 (position 4), which becomes 4. Then another 2. So perhaps after each 2, the next same number (if it's the same as the one before the 2) becomes 4. Wait, but in the third input row, after the first 2, the next is 1, which becomes 4. Then another 2. Then next number is 2 again. So maybe after each 2, the next occurrence of the number that was before the 2 is changed to 4. So the rule could be: for each occurrence of 2 in the list, look at the number immediately preceding the 2. Then, the next consecutive occurrences of that same number after the 2 are replaced with 4s until a different number is encountered.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example 0, second input row:\n\nInput: [1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0]\n\nThe 2 is at position 2. The number before it is 1. Then the next numbers after the 2 are 1s. All of these 1s are turned into 4s. So from position 3 onward, until a 0 is found, all 1s become 4s. That's six 1s turned into 4s. Then in the third input row of Example 0: [1,1,1,2,1,2,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0]. The first 2 is at position 3. The number before it is 1 (position 2). The next number after the 2 is 1 (position 4), which becomes 4. Then there's a 2 at position 5. The number before that is 1 (position 4, now 4). Wait, perhaps the 2 at position 5 is preceded by 1 (original input) but in the output, that position is 4. Hmm, maybe the replacement happens first, and then the next 2 is considered. Or maybe the processing is done in the original input. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that whenever a 2 is present in the input list, any number that comes after the 2 and is the same as the number immediately before the 2 gets replaced with 4. So, for each 2 in the list, look at the preceding number. Then, all subsequent occurrences of that number in the list (after the 2) are replaced with 4. But that doesn't fit because in Example 0's third input row, after the first 2, the next number is 1 (replaced by 4), then another 2. The next number after that 2 is 2. The number before that 2 is 1 (original) but in the output, it's 4. Hmm. So maybe the processing is done sequentially. Each time a 2 is encountered, look at the preceding element, then replace the next consecutive elements equal to that preceding element with 4s, until a different element is found.\n\nLet's take Example 0's third input row again:\n\nInput: [1,1,1,2,1,2,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0]\n\nThe first 2 is at index 3. The preceding number is 1 (index 2). The next element is 1 (index 4) which becomes 4. Then at index 5 is a 2. The preceding number is 1 (index 4, which was replaced to 4). So for this 2 at index 5, the preceding number is 4. So if the rule is to look at the preceding number (regardless of whether it was replaced), then after the 2 at index 5, the next element is 2 (index 6). The preceding number is 2 (index 5). So the next elements after 2 at index 5 would be 2s, but since the preceding number is 2, which is the same as the 2s after it, but 2 is not replaced. So maybe this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s themselves are not part of the replacement, but any number that is preceded by a 2 and matches the number before the 2 gets replaced. Wait, but how does that work? For example, in the first example's second input row, after the 2, the next elements are 1s, which are replaced. But in the third input row, after the first 2 (index 3), the next is 1, replaced to 4. Then the next element is 2 (index 5). The preceding element is 4 (from replacement), so after that 2, there's a 2. But since the preceding number is 4, any 4s after the 2 would be replaced. But in the output, those 2s remain 2. So perhaps this isn't the case.\n\nHmm, maybe the pattern is that whenever a 2 is found, the immediately following numbers that are the same as the number before the 2 are replaced with 4, but only the consecutive ones immediately after the 2. So it's a local replacement.\n\nFor example, in the first example's second input row: the 2 is at position 2. The number before it is 1. The next elements are 1s until a 0. All those consecutive 1s after the 2 are replaced with 4.\n\nIn the third input row of Example 0, after the 2 at position 3, there's a 1 which is replaced with 4. Then comes another 2. The number before that 2 is 4 (from replacement). So if the next number after this 2 is 2, then the number before the 2 is 4. So any consecutive 4s after the 2 would be replaced. But in this case, after the 2 is another 2, which is not 4, so no replacement.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: for each occurrence of 2 in the list, look at the number immediately before it. Then, replace all consecutive instances of that number that come immediately after the 2 with 4s. The replacement stops when a different number is encountered.\n\nLet me test this with another example. In Example 1's fourth input row:\n\nInput: [0,0,2,8,2,2,2,8,0,0,0,2,8,2,8,0]\n\nOutput: [0,0,2,4,2,2,2,8,0,0,0,2,4,2,8,0]\n\nSo the first 2 is at index 2. The number before it is 0. So after the 2, the next number is 8. Since it's not the same as the preceding number (0), no replacement. Wait, but in the output, the 8 is replaced to 4. Hmm, this contradicts the previous idea. So maybe my hypothesis is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the indices. Let me count:\n\nInput row is [0,0,2,8,2,2,2,8,0,0,0,2,8,2,8,0]\n\nThe 2 is at position 2 (third element). The preceding number is 0 (position 1). The next number after the 2 is 8 (position 3). Since 8 is different from 0, no replacement. But in the output, the 8 at position 3 becomes 4. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the rule isn't based on the preceding number.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the 2 acts as a marker to replace the next occurrence of the same number as the one before the 2. For example, in the first example's second input row: after the 2, the next 1 is replaced to 4. But then there are more 1s after that, which are all replaced to 4. So it's not just the next occurrence but all consecutive occurrences.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that whenever there's a 2, the following elements that are the same as the element immediately before the 2 are replaced with 4s until a different number is found.\n\nIn Example 1's fourth input row: the first 2 is at position 2. The element before is 0. So after the 2, the next element is 8, which is different, so no replacement. But in the output, the 8 becomes 4. So that's conflicting. Hmm. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 2 is part of a sequence where a number X is followed by a 2, and then replaced by X, 2, followed by Xs which are replaced by 4s. Wait, perhaps it's a pattern where whenever a number X is followed by a 2, then all subsequent Xs after the 2 are replaced by 4s until a different number is encountered.\n\nWait, let's take Example 0's second input row again:\n\nInput: [1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0]\n\nHere, the 2 is preceded by 1. Then all the 1s after the 2 are replaced with 4s until a 0 is found. So in this case, the 2 acts as a marker, and all instances of the preceding number (1) that come after the 2 (until a different number) are replaced with 4.\n\nIn Example 1's fourth input row: [0,0,2,8,2,2,2,8,0,0,0,2,8,2,8,0]\n\nThe first 2 is at index 2. Preceding number is 0. So after the 2, any 0s would be replaced. But the next number is 8. So no replacement. But in the output, the 8 becomes 4. Hmm, this doesn't fit. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nLooking at Example 1's fourth input row's output: the 8 after the first 2 is replaced to 4. The preceding number before the 2 is 0. But 8 is not 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the 2 is part of a sequence where the previous number is X and the next number is Y. If X equals Y, then Y becomes 4. Otherwise, no. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps whenever a number is followed by a 2, that number is replaced by 4. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is a separator. All occurrences of a certain number after a 2 are replaced with 4. But which number? For example, in Example 0, after the 2, all 1s become 4s. In Example 1, after a 2, 8s become 4s. So perhaps the number to be replaced is the number that comes after the 2. Wait, but in Example 0's second input row, after the 2 is 1. So all consecutive 1s after the 2 are replaced with 4s. In Example 1's fourth input row, after the first 2 is 8. So that 8 is replaced with 4. Then the next elements are 2, 2, 2, 8. The next 2s are followed by 8. So after the 2, the next number is 2. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, in the fourth input row of Example 1, after the first 2 (which is at index 2), the next number is 8, which is replaced to 4. Then there's a 2 (index 4), followed by 2, 2, 8. The 2 at index 4 is followed by another 2. So according to the previous pattern, after the 2, the next number is 2. But 2 is the same as the number after it. So maybe in this case, since the number after the 2 is 2 (same as the 2), nothing is replaced. But in the output, those 2s remain 2. So perhaps the rule is: after each 2 in the list, replace the next occurrence of the same number that was before the 2. But in this case, the first 2's preceding number is 0, so replace any 0s after the 2. But the next number is 8, so no replacement. But in the output, it's replaced to 4. This is conflicting.\n\nMaybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look for other patterns. In the output lists, the numbers 4 appear only in the output where there's a 2 in the input. So 4s are introduced in the output where there were 1s or 8s in the input. So the 4s are replacements for certain numbers, triggered by the presence of a 2.\n\nLooking at Example 2, in the fifth input row, the 3s after the 2s are replaced with 4s. So the pattern is that after a 2, certain numbers are replaced with 4. But how to determine which ones.\n\nAnother idea: The 2 acts as a marker. The numbers that are between two 2s are replaced with 4. For example, in Example 0's second input row, there's a single 2 followed by 1s which are all replaced with 4. But in other cases, like Example 1's fourth input row, after a 2 and before another 2, the number is 8, which is replaced. But this doesn't hold for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, the number immediately after a 2 is replaced with 4. But in Example 0's second input row, the first 2 is followed by six 1s. All are replaced. So perhaps it's all consecutive numbers after a 2 that are the same as the first number after the 2. For example, in that case, the first number after the 2 is 1, so all consecutive 1s after the 2 are replaced with 4.\n\nIn Example 1's fourth input row, the first number after the 2 is 8, so that 8 is replaced to 4. Then the next elements are 2, which is different, so replacement stops. Then another 2, followed by 2, which would replace consecutive 2s with 4s? But in the output, those 2s remain. Hmm, no. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is: whenever a number X is followed by a 2, then all Xs after the 2 are replaced with 4. But that doesn't fit because in Example 0's second input row, the 2 is preceded by 1, and all 1s after the 2 are replaced. In Example 1's fourth input row, the 2 is preceded by 0, and the next number is 8, which is not 0, so no replacement. But in the output, the 8 is replaced to 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any number that comes after a 2 and is the same as the number that comes before the 2 is replaced with 4. So in Example 0's second input row: the 2 is preceded by 1, so any 1s after the 2 are replaced. In Example 1's fourth input row: the 2 is preceded by 0, so any 0s after the 2 are replaced. But in the output, the 8 is replaced. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to look for a different pattern. Maybe the 2 is a marker, and the next occurrence of the same number as the one before the 2 is replaced with 4, and this repeats for all subsequent occurrences until another 2 is encountered. Or maybe the replacement continues until a different number is found, regardless of 2s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern involves binary representations. For example, 4 is 100 in binary. Maybe when a 2 (10 in binary) is present, it's combined with 1s (01) to make 4. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0, the first input row doesn't have any 2s, so it remains the same. The second input row has a 2, and some 1s after are replaced with 4s. Similarly, in Example 1, the fourth input row has 2s and the 8s after them are replaced with 4s. In Example 2, the fifth input row has 2s and the 3s after are replaced with 4s. So it's a general pattern: wherever there's a 2 in the input, the following numbers of a certain type are replaced with 4s. The key is to determine what that certain type is.\n\nLooking at all the examples, it seems that when a 2 is present in the input list, the number that comes immediately after the 2 is replaced with 4, but only if it's the same as the number that came before the 2. Let's test this:\n\nIn Example 0's second input row: the number before the 2 is 1, the number after the 2 is 1. So replaced to 4. Then, the next numbers are also 1s, so they are replaced to 4. This continues until a 0 is found.\n\nIn Example 1's fourth input row: the first 2 is at position 2. The number before is 0. The number after is 8. 8 is not equal to 0, so no replacement. But in the output, it's replaced to 4. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number after the 2 is replaced to 4 regardless of the previous number. But then in Example 0's second input row, all 1s after the 2 are replaced. But in Example 1's fourth input row, the 8 after the first 2 is replaced to 4, then the next 2s are followed by 2s and 8s. The 8 after another 2 is replaced to 4. But in that output, the 8 after the second 2 is replaced to 4. So this would imply that every number after a 2 is replaced to 4. But that's not the case. For example, in Example 1's fourth input row, after the 2 at position 4 (which is a 2), the next number is 2, which is not replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions where replacements occur. In Example 0's second input row, the 2 is at position 2. The replacements start at position 3 and continue until position 8 (all 1s become 4s). In Example 1's fourth input row, the 2 is at position 2, and the next number (position 3) is 8 replaced to 4. Then another 2 at position 4, which has next number 2 (no replacement). Then another 2 at position 5, next number 2 (no replacement). Then a 2 at position 6, next number 8 replaced to 4. So it's inconsistent.\n\nWait, in Example 1's fourth input row, the output changes the 8 at position 3 to 4. The 2 is at position 2. The next element is 8. But in the output, it's 4. So why is that?\n\nMaybe the rule is that any number that follows a 2, regardless of what it is, is replaced with 4. But then, in Example 1's fourth input row, after the first 2 (position 2), the next number is 8 \u2192 4. Then the next number is 2 (position 4), which is replaced to 4? But in the output, it's still 2. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only numbers that are the same as the number before the 2 are replaced. So in Example 0's second input row, before the 2 is 1. The numbers after the 2 are 1s \u2192 replaced to 4. In Example 1's fourth input row, before the first 2 is 0. So numbers after the 2 that are 0 \u2192 replaced. But the number after is 8, which is not 0. So no replacement. But in the output, the 8 is replaced to 4. So this contradicts.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let me look for another angle. Perhaps the 2 is part of a pattern where it's surrounded by the same numbers, and those are replaced. Like X, 2, X becomes X, 2, 4. But in Example 0's second input row, it's 1,2,1 \u2192 1,2,4. Then the next 1s are replaced. But this doesn't fit all cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe every time a 2 appears, the next occurrence of the same number as the first element in the list is replaced with 4. But that's not consistent across examples.\n\nLet's consider another possibility: The replacement is done in runs. Whenever there's a 2 in the list, the previous run of the same number (before the 2) is replaced with 4s. For example, in Example 0's second input row: [1,1,2,1,1,1...], the 1s before the 2 are left as is, but the 1s after are replaced. But this doesn't fit. Or perhaps the opposite: the run after the 2 is replaced.\n\nWait, in Example 0's second input row, the 2 is in the third position. The numbers after the 2 are 1s. They are replaced with 4s. So the run of 1s after the 2 are replaced. So the rule is: after every 2, replace the following run of the same number (as the one immediately before the 2) with 4s.\n\nBut in Example 1's fourth input row: [0,0,2,8,2,2,2,8,0,0,0,2,8,2,8,0]. The first 2 is preceded by 0. The run after the 2 is 8. Since 8 is not 0, no replacement. But in the output, the 8 is replaced to 4. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the run after the 2 is replaced regardless of the preceding number. But why is the 8 replaced to 4?\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that every 2 in the input list is replaced with 4 in the output, but the examples show that 2s remain. For instance, in Example 0's second input row, the 2 stays as 2. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: The numbers in the output are the same as the input, except for runs that start with a 2 and are followed by the same number. For example, if there's a 2 followed by a number X, then those Xs are replaced with 4s. But in Example 0's second input row, the 2 is followed by 1s. So all those 1s are replaced with 4s. In Example 1's fourth input row, the 2 is followed by 8. So that 8 is replaced with 4. Then the next 2 is followed by 2s, which are replaced with 4s? No, in the output, those 2s remain. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, whenever a 2 is followed by a number X, that X is replaced with 4, but only the first occurrence. But in Example 0's second input row, all the following 1s are replaced. So not just the first.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another pattern. Perhaps the 4s in the output are sums of previous numbers. For example, 1+3=4. But I don't see how that applies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to replace the number that comes after a 2 with 4, regardless of its value. For example, in Example 0's second input row: after the 2, all 1s are replaced. But that would require replacing each of them. If the rule is to replace the first number after a 2 with 4, but not the subsequent ones. But in the example, multiple numbers after the 2 are replaced.\n\nAnother observation: In all training examples, the outputs have 4s only where the input has a 2 nearby. So maybe the rule is that whenever a 2 is present in the input list, the numbers that are next to the 2 (either before or after) are replaced with 4s. But in Example 0's second input row, the 2 is at position 2, and the numbers after are replaced. But the number before (1) is not replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that whenever a 2 is encountered in the list, the next instance of the number that was two positions before the 2 is replaced with 4. For example, in Example 0's second input row: the 2 is at position 2. Two positions before is position 0, which is 1. So the next instance of 1 after the 2 is replaced. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nThis is taking a long time. Let's try to look at the test input and see if we can spot a pattern there. The test input has 9s and 2s. For example, the sixth test input row is [0,0,0,0,0,9,2,2,2,2,9,0,9,9,0,0,0,0]. In the output, perhaps the 2s are followed by 9s, which would be replaced with 4s. But the test input's expected output isn't provided, so we have to deduce it.\n\nBut given the training examples, the pattern seems to be that whenever a 2 is present in the input, the next consecutive occurrences of the same number that comes after the 2 (regardless of their position) are replaced with 4s. For example:\n\nIn Example 0's second input row: 2 is followed by 1s \u2192 4s.\nIn Example 1's fourth input row: 2 is followed by 8 \u2192 4.\nIn Example 2's fifth input row: 2 is followed by 3s \u2192 4s.\n\nSo the pattern is: For each occurrence of 2 in the input list, replace all consecutive instances of the same number that immediately follow the 2 with 4s. The replacement stops when a different number is encountered.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nLooking at the test input's second row: [9, 2, 9, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Let's process each 2:\n\n- First 2 is at position 1. The next number is 9. So replace consecutive 9s after the 2 with 4s. But after the 2, the next number is 9, followed by 2. So the first 9 becomes 4. The next element is 2, which is a different number, so replacement stops. So the output for this position would be 4.\n\n- Next 2 is at position 3. The next number is 2. So after this 2, the next number is 2. Since it's the same as the 2 (but 2s are not replaced, as per the training examples), no replacement.\n\n- Next 2 is at position 4. The next number is 9. Replace consecutive 9s after this 2. The next element is 9, which becomes 4. Then comes 0. Replacement stops.\n\nSo for this input row, the output would have 4s where the 9s are immediately after the 2s.\n\nApplying this to all rows in the test input:\n\nFor example, the sixth test input row: [0,0,0,0,0,9,2,2,2,2,9,0,9,9,0,0,0,0]. The 2s are at positions 6,7,8,9. Let's process each 2:\n\n- The first 2 at position 6. Next number is 2 (position7), which is the same, so replace with 4s. But according to the training examples, 2s are not replaced. Wait, in the training examples, when there's a 2 followed by another 2, they remain. For instance, in Example 1's fourth input row, after the 2 there are other 2s which are not replaced. So the rule might be that only non-2 numbers following a 2 are replaced. So in this test case, the 2s after the first 2 are not replaced. But the next number after the first 2 is 2, which is the same as the 2 itself. So according to the pattern, since the number following the 2 is 2, no replacement occurs. But in the output, maybe the 9 that comes after the 2s would be replaced. Let's see: after the last 2 (position9), the next number is 9. So this 9 would be replaced to 4.\n\nThis is getting really complicated. But based on the training examples, the pattern seems to be: For each 2 in the input list, look at the next consecutive elements. If they are the same as the first element after the 2, replace all consecutive instances of that element with 4s until a different element is encountered.\n\nSo in the test input's sixth row: after the 2s (positions6-9), the next element is 9. So all consecutive 9s after the last 2 would be replaced. So the 9 at position10 becomes 4. Then the next elements are 0, so replacement stops.\n\nApplying this to each row in the test input would require checking for each 2, then replacing the following consecutive numbers that are the same as the first number after the 2 with 4s.\n\nNow, let's process each test input row:\n\nTake the first test input row: [0,0,0,9,9,9,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0]. No 2s in this row, so output is the same.\n\nSecond test input row: [9,2,9,2,2,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]. \n\nProcessing each 2:\n\n- 2 at index1: next element is9 \u2192 replace consecutive 9s. The next element is9 at index2 \u2192 becomes4. Then index3 is2 \u2192 different. So output becomes [9,2,4,2,2,9,...].\n\n- 2 at index3: next element is2 \u2192 same as 2. Since the next element is2, which is a 2, no replacement (as per training examples where 2s are not replaced to4). \n\n- 2 at index4: next element is9 \u2192 replace. The 9 at index5 becomes4. Then index6 is0 \u2192 different.\n\nSo the row becomes: [9,2,4,2,2,4,0,0,0,9,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nThird test input row: [0,2,2,9,9,2,0,0,9,9,9,0,0,9,0,0,9,0].\n\nProcessing each 2:\n\n- First 2 at index1: next element is2. Since it's a 2, no replacement.\n\n- Second 2 at index2: next element is9. Replace consecutive 9s. Index3 and4 are9 \u2192 replaced to4,4.

No 2s, same.\n\nTenth test input row: [9,9,0,9,0,9,0,9,9,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,9]. No 2s, same.\n\nEleventh test input row: [0,9,9,0,9,0,9,2,9,0,0,9,0,0,9,9,9,9].\n\nProcessing the 2 at index7: next element is9 \u2192 replace to4. Consecutive 9s after the 2 are replaced. So index8's9 becomes4. The next element is0 \u2192 different. So the row becomes: [0,9,9,0,9,0,9,2,4,0,0,9,0,0,9,9,9,9].\n\nTwelfth test input row: [0,9,9,0,0,9,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,9,9,9,0,9].\n\nProcessing the 2 at index6: next element is9. Replace consecutive 9s. Index7,8,9 are9 \u2192 replaced to4,4,4. So row becomes: [0,9,9,0,0,9,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,9,9,9,0,9].\n\nThirteenth test input row: [9,0,9,9,0,9,9,9,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,9,9,0]. No 2s, same.\n\nFourteenth test input row: [9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,9,2,2,9,2,2,9,0].\n\nProcessing 2s:\n\n- 2 at index11: next element is2 (index12) \u2192 same. No replacement.\n\n- 2 at index12: next is9 (index13) \u2192 replace to4. Consecutive 9s after would be replaced. The 9 at index13 becomes4. Next element is2 \u2192 different.\n\n- 2 at index14: next is2 (index15) \u2192 same. No replacement.\n\n- 2 at index15: next is9 (index16) \u2192 replace to4. The 9 at index16 becomes4.\n\nSo the row becomes: [9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,9,2,2,4,2,2,4,0].\n\nFifteenth test input row: [0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,0,2,9,2,9,9,2,9].\n\nProcessing 2s:\n\n- 2 at index11: next element is9 \u2192 replace to4. Consecutive 9s after. The 9 at index12 becomes4. Next is2 \u2192 different.\n\n- 2 at index13: next element is9 \u2192 replace to4. Consecutive 9s: index14 and15 are9,9 \u2192 replaced to4,4. Next element is2 \u2192 different.\n\n- 2 at index16: next element is9 \u2192 replace to4.\n\nSo the row becomes: [0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,0,2,4,2,4,4,2,4].\n\nSixteenth test input row: [0,9,0,9,0,0,9,9,0,9,0,2,2,9,2,2,9,0].\n\nProcessing 2s:\n\n- 2 at index11: next element is2 (index12) \u2192 same. No replacement.\n\n- 2 at index12: next element is9 \u2192 replace to4. Consecutive 9s after: index13's9 becomes4. Next element is2 \u2192 different.\n\n- 2 at index14: next element is2 (index15) \u2192 same. No replacement.\n\n- 2 at index15: next element is9 \u2192 replace to4. Index16's9 becomes4.\n\nSo the row becomes: [0,9,0,9,0,0,9,9,0,9,0,2,2,4,2,2,4,0].\n\nSeventeenth test input row: [9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,9,9,9,0]. No 2s, same.\n\nAfter processing all test input rows with this pattern, the final output would replace the appropriate numbers with 4s wherever a 2 is followed by the same number as the next element. But according to the training examples, the replacement continues for consecutive same numbers after the 2. So in the test input's sixth row, after the 2s, the 9s following them would be replaced. But I need to make sure I'm applying the rule correctly.\n\nBut since the test input requires the same format as the training examples, the output will have 4s replacing the numbers that follow a 2, provided they are the same as the first number after the 2 and consecutively follow. \n\nThis is the best I can deduce based on the training examples. Now, applying this pattern to the test input and generating the output accordingly.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input list is transformed into an output list. The main thing I notice is that in some positions, the numbers are changing. Let's compare the inputs and outputs in each example.\n\nStarting with Example 0. Let's take the first input and output pair:\n\nInput: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nOutput: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nSo here, it's the same. Hmm, maybe not all elements change. Let's look at the next one.\n\nSecond input in Example 0:\nInput: [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nOutput: [1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nSo here, the third element is 2, which stays, but then positions 4-9 (indices 3 to 8) are all 1 in the input but become 4 in the output. Wait, but the output shows positions 3 to 8 as 4. So maybe when there's a sequence of the same number after a 2, they are replaced with 4?\n\nWait, looking at the third example input in Example 0:\nInput: [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nOutput: [1, 1, 4, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nHere, the third element was 1, but in the output it's 4. Then the fifth element (input 1) becomes 4. So maybe there's a rule when a number is followed by a 2? Or maybe when a number is adjacent to a 2, it gets replaced by 4?\n\nWait, perhaps it's about sequences where a number is followed by a 2. Let me check more examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 2, 8, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 4, 4, 2, 8, 0]\nHere, the input has 8s followed by a 2. The output changes the 8s before the 2 into 4s. Wait, the 8s at positions 11 and 12 in input become 4s in output, followed by a 2. So maybe whenever a number (like 8) is immediately before a 2, it's replaced by 4. But in Example 0, 1s before 2s became 4s. So maybe the rule is that any number (let's say x) that is immediately followed by a 2 is replaced by 2*x. Wait, 1*2=2, but in the output it's 4. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait in the first example of Example 0, the input has 2 followed by 1s. Wait the output changes those 1s to 4. So maybe when there's a 2, the preceding consecutive same numbers are replaced with 4? Or maybe when a 2 is encountered, the numbers before it are replaced with 4 if they are of the same value as the one preceding the 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a 2 appears in the list, the previous elements (to the left) of the same value as the element just before the 2 are changed to 4. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's second input, the third element is 2. Then positions 4-8 (indices 3-8) are 1s. In the output, those 1s become 4. So the 2 is at index 2, and the following 1s (indices 3-8) are replaced with 4. But why? Wait, maybe the 2 is part of a group. Or maybe the 2 is acting as a separator, and the numbers after it up to a certain point are replaced. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that whenever two consecutive 2s are present, they are replaced with 4s. But in the first example, the input has a single 2. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the input in Example 1's fourth input:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 2, 8, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 2, 8, 0]\nHere, the 8 after the 2 becomes 4. So maybe when a 2 is followed by a number (like 8), the 8 is replaced by 4. Wait, in the input, after the 2 (at index 3) comes 8, which becomes 4. Then the next elements are 2, 2, 2, 8. The first 2 becomes 2, the next 2s stay, but the 8 becomes 8. Wait, no. The output here is 2,4, then 2,2,2,8. So maybe the 8 that comes immediately after a 2 is replaced by 4. But in the input, the 8 is after the 2. So 2 followed by 8 becomes 4. Then why?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input has a 2 followed by 1s, which become 4s. So maybe when a 2 is followed by a number x (not 2), then x is replaced by 2x. But 1*2=2, but in the output it's 4. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe whenever a 2 appears in the input, the next occurrence of the same number as the one immediately before the 2 is replaced with 4. Let's see. For example, in Example 0's second input: [1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,...]. The 2 is at index 2. The element before is 1. Then all consecutive 1s after the 2 (indices 3-8) are replaced with 4. So maybe the rule is: when a 2 is encountered, look at the previous element (before the 2) and replace all consecutive occurrences of that number after the 2 with 4. Wait, but in the input, the 2 is at index 2. The element before is 1. Then the elements after the 2 (starting at index 3) are 1s. Those are replaced with 4s. So yes, that seems to fit.\n\nLet's check another example. In Example 1's fourth input:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 2, 8, 0]\nThe first 2 is at index 2. The element before is 0. But after the 2 is 8, which is not 0, so maybe no change. But in the output, the 8 at index 3 becomes 4. Wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the 2 is in the middle. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe whenever a 2 is present in the input, all occurrences of the number that comes immediately after the 2 in the input are replaced with 4. Wait, in Example 0's second input, after the 2 is 1. So all 1s after the 2 become 4. But in the output, the 1s after the 2 are replaced with 4. So that could be the case.\n\nWait, in Example 1's fourth input: the 2 is at index 2. The next element after the 2 is 8. So all 8s after that would become 4s? But in the output, the 8 at index 3 is replaced with 4, but the 8 at index 7 is still 8. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe only the consecutive elements after the 2 that are the same as the element immediately after the 2 are replaced with 4. Let's see. In Example 0's second input, the 2 is followed by 1s. So those consecutive 1s after the 2 become 4. In Example 1's fourth input, the 2 at index 2 is followed by 8. The consecutive 8s after that would be only the 8 at index 3. Then the rest are 2s. So the 8 is replaced by 4, but the next elements are 2s, which are not 8, so they stay. Then later there's another 8 after 2s. But in the output, the next 8 (index 12) becomes 4. Let's check the output:\n\nOriginal input for that line: [0,0,2,8,2,2,2,8,0,0,0,2,8,2,8,0]\nOutput: [0,0,2,4,2,2,2,8,0,0,0,2,4,2,8,0]\n\nSo the 8 at index 3 becomes 4. The next 8 at index 7 is unchanged. Then at index 12, there's another 8 after a 2. So after the 2 at index 11, the next element is 8 (index 12), which becomes 4. So perhaps the rule is: whenever a 2 is immediately followed by a number x (not 2), replace that x with 4, and if there are consecutive x's after the 2, replace them all with 4. But in Example 0's second input, the 2 is followed by multiple 1s, which are replaced by 4s. So that seems to fit.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's third input:\n\nInput: [1,1,1,2,1,2,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0]\nOutput: [1,1,4,2,4,2,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0]\nSo here, the 2 is at index 3. The element before is 1. The element after is 1 (index 4). So that 1 is replaced with 4. But then there's another 2 after that. So perhaps each time a 2 is found, the next element (if it's not a 2) is replaced with 4. But also, consecutive same numbers after the 2 would be replaced. Wait, in this case, after the 2 at index 3, there's a 1 (index4) which becomes 4. Then the next element is a 2 (index5), so no change. So maybe the rule is that whenever a 2 is followed by a number x (not 2), the x is replaced by 4. But if there are multiple x's consecutively after the 2, they are all replaced by 4.\n\nSo the transformation is: For each occurrence of 2 in the input, look at the next element. If it's not a 2, replace it and all consecutive same numbers after it with 4. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's second input: The 2 is at index2. The next element is 1. Replace all consecutive 1s (indices3-8) with 4. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1's fourth input: The 2 at index2 is followed by 8 (index3). Replace that 8 with 4. The next element is 2, so stop. Then later, the 2 at index11 is followed by 8 (index12). Replace that 8 with 4. So output has 4s at those positions.\n\nIn Example 2's fifth input:\n\nInput: [0,3,3,2,2,3,3,2,0,0,0,3,3,0]\nOutput: [0,3,3,2,2,4,4,2,0,0,0,3,3,0]\nThe 2 at index3 and 4. Then followed by 3s. So the next element after the 2s (since they are consecutive 2s) would be 3. So replace those 3s (indices5 and 6) with 4. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: wherever there's a 2 in the input, check the next element. If it's not a 2, replace that element and any consecutive same elements following it with 4. The 2 itself remains as is.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Iterate through the list.\n2. For each element, if it's a 2, check the next element.\n3. If the next element is not a 2, take that value (x) and replace all consecutive occurrences of x immediately after the 2 with 4.\n4. The 2 itself remains unchanged.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input lines:\n\nFirst line:\n[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]\n\nLooking for 2s. There are none here, so output is same as input.\n\nSecond line:\n[9, 2, 9, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst 2 at index1. Next element is 9. Replace that 9 (index2) with 4. Then check consecutive 9s. After index2 is 2 (index3), so only the 9 at index2 becomes 4.\n\nNext 2 at index3. Next element is 2 (index4), so no change (since next element is 2).\n\nNext 2 at index4. Next element is 9 (index5). Replace that 9 with 4, and check consecutive 9s. The next element after 5 is 0, so only index5 becomes 4.\n\nSo the transformed line would have 4s at indices2 and5.\n\nThird line:\n[0, 2, 2, 9, 9, 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0]\n\nFirst 2 at index1. Next element is 2 (index2), so no change.\n\nNext 2 at index2. Next element is 9 (index3). Replace 9 and consecutive 9s. So indices3 and4 (9s) become 4s.\n\nThen 2 at index5. Next element is 0 (index6), which is not 9, so no replacement. So no changes here.\n\nFourth line:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0]\n\nNo 2s, so no changes.\n\nFifth line:\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 2, 9, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n2 at index6. Next element is 9 (index7). Replace with 4. Check consecutive 9s. Next element is 2 (index8), so only index7 becomes 4.\n\nNext 2 at index8. Next element is 2 (index9), so no change.\n\nNext 2 at index9. Next element is 9 (index10). Replace that 9 with 4. Next element is 0 (index11), so only index10 becomes4.\n\nSixth line:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n2s at indices6,7,8,9. Next elements after each 2:\n\nFor index6: next is 2 (index7), no change.\n\nSame for 7,8,9: next elements are 2,2,2, then 9.\n\nOnly the last 2 (index9) is followed by 9 (index10). So replace 9 with4.\n\nSeventh line:\n[9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9]\n\nNo 2s, so no changes.\n\nEighth line:\n[0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNo 2s.\n\nNinth line:\n[9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]\n\nNo 2s.\n\nTenth line:\n[0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 2, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n\n2 at index7. Next element is9 (index8). Replace with4. Consecutive 9s after 8? Next is0 (index9). So only index8 becomes4.\n\nEleventh line:\n[0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 2, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9]\n\n2 at index6. Next element is9 (index7). Replace with4. Then consecutive 9s (indices7,8,9) become4s.\n\nTwelfth line:\n[9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0]\n\nNo 2s.\n\nThirteenth line:\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 2, 9, 2, 2, 9, 0]\n\n2s at indices11,12,14,15. \n\nAt index11: 2 is followed by 2 (index12) \u2192 no change.\n\nAt index12: 2 is followed by9 (index13). Replace9 with4. Then next elements are 2,9,2,2,9. Only index13 becomes4. \n\nAt index14: 2 followed by2 (index15) \u2192 no change.\n\nAt index15: 2 followed by9 (index16). Replace with4. Next element is0 (index17), so only index16 becomes4.\n\nFourteenth line:\n[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 9, 2, 9, 9, 2, 9]\n\n2s at indices11,13,16.\n\nAt index11: next is9 (index12) \u2192 replace with4. Consecutive 9s? Next element is2 (index13), so only index12 becomes4.\n\nAt index13: next is9 (index14) \u2192 replace with4. Consecutive 9s (index14 and15) \u2192 both become4.\n\nAt index16: next is9 (index17) \u2192 replace with4.\n\nFifteenth line:\n[0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 9, 2, 2, 9, 0]\n\n2s at indices11,12,14,15.\n\nAt index11: next is2 (index12) \u2192 no change.\n\nAt index12: next is9 (index13) \u2192 replace with4. Consecutive 9s? Next element is2 (index14), so only index13 becomes4.\n\nAt index14: next is2 (index15) \u2192 no change.\n\nAt index15: next is9 (index16) \u2192 replace with4.\n\nSixteenth line:\n[9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0]\n\nNo 2s.\n\nSo applying all these changes to each line of the test input should generate the correct output.",
