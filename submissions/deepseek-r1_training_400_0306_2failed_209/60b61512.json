        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, both inputs have 4s and 0s, and the outputs replace some of those 4s with 7s. Let me compare the input and output for each example closely.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has several rows. Let's take the third row of the input: [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, ...]. The output for that row becomes [4, 7, 4, ...]. So the 0 in the middle turned into a 7. Similarly, the fourth row input is [0, 0, 4, ...], which becomes [7, 7, 4]. So maybe 0s that are adjacent to certain numbers are being replaced? But how?\n\nLooking at the other rows, like in the fifth input row [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0], the output becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 4, 0]. Wait, the sixth element changes from 0 to 7. Hmm. Let's check the surrounding cells. Maybe it's something to do with neighboring 4s. Let's think of it like a cellular automaton or some kind of neighbor-based rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of 4s adjacent to a 0. If a 0 has exactly three adjacent 4s, it becomes a 7? Let's check that. Take the third row in Example 0: the middle 0. Its neighbors: above is 4 (from the row above, which is [4,4,4]), left is 4, right is 4. Wait, in the input row [4, 0, 4], the 0 is between two 4s. But the row above is [4,4,4], so the cell above the 0 is 4. So that's three 4s around it (left, right, above). If that's the case, then maybe when a 0 is surrounded by exactly three 4s, it turns into a 7. Let's see other cases.\n\nIn Example 0, fifth row input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0]. The output is [0,0,0,0,0,7,4,4,0]. The 0 that becomes 7 is at position 5 (0-based index 5). Let's check its neighbors. The cell to the right is 4 (index 6), the cell below is [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0]. So below it is index 5 in the next row, which is 4? Wait, the next row is the sixth row in input: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0]. So the cell below the 0 in position 5 (input fifth row, index 5) is row six, index 5, which is 4. Then the neighbors would be right (4), below (4), and maybe left? Wait, original cell is index 5. Left neighbor is index 4 (0), right is 6 (4), above is index 5 in row four, which is 0. So neighbors: above (0), left (0), right (4), below (4). So two 4s. So maybe not three. Hmm, maybe my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different rule. Let's look at another example. In Example 1's input, the third row is [4,4,4], and the output is the same. But the second row in input is [0,4,4], output is [7,4,4]. The 0 in that row becomes 7. Let's check its neighbors. The cell above is the first row's [4,4,4], so the cell above is 4. The left neighbor is 0 (same row's left?), but in the same row, the 0 is at index 0. Wait, the second row input is [0,4,4,0,...]. So the 0 is at index 0. Its neighbors: above (row 1, index 0 is 4?), left neighbor is outside the grid (since it's the first element), right neighbor is 4. Below neighbor (row 3, index 0 is 4). So the 0 at row 2, column 0 has neighbors: up (4), right (4), down (4). That's three 4s. So perhaps when a 0 has exactly three 4 neighbors (like the middle cell in Example 0's third row), it turns into a 7. But then, in Example 0's fifth row, the 0 that turned into 7 had two 4 neighbors? Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that a 0 is replaced by 7 if it has exactly two 4 neighbors. Let me check. In Example 0, third row, middle 0: neighbors above (4), left (4), right (4) \u2192 three 4s. So that would not fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's the case that 0s become 7s if they are on the edge of a group of 4s. For example, in Example 0's third row, the 0 is sandwiched between two 4s and has a 4 above. Maybe when a 0 is adjacent to three 4s in certain positions. Or perhaps it's the corners where 4s meet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of 4s in a Moore neighborhood (all eight surrounding cells). Let's check Example 0's third row, middle 0. The cells around it would be:\n\nTop-left: row 1, column 0 (4)\nTop: row 1, column 1 (4)\nTop-right: row 1, column 2 (4)\nLeft: row 2, column 0 (4)\nRight: row 2, column 2 (4)\nBottom-left: row 3, column 0 (0)\nBottom: row 3, column 1 (0)\nBottom-right: row 3, column 2 (4)\n\nSo total 4s in the Moore neighborhood: top-left (4), top (4), top-right (4), left (4), right (4), bottom-right (4). That's six 4s. But the cell becomes 7. So perhaps if a 0 has exactly 3 or more 4s around it, it becomes 7. But in Example 0's fifth row, the 0 that becomes 7 is in row 5, column 5 (if I'm looking at the fifth row input [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0], the sixth element is 0, which becomes 7. Let's check its Moore neighborhood. \n\nRow 5, column 5 (0-based index 5). Neighbors:\n\nTop: row4, column5 (0)\nTop-right: row4, column6 (4)\nRight: row5, column6 (4)\nBottom-right: row6, column6 (0)\nBottom: row6, column5 (4)\nBottom-left: row6, column4 (0)\nLeft: row5, column4 (0)\nTop-left: row4, column4 (0)\n\nSo surrounding cells: top-right (4), right (4), bottom (4). So three 4s. So when a 0 has three 4s in its Moore neighborhood, it becomes 7. Let's check another case.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the second row is [0,4,4,0,...], output becomes [7,4,4,...]. The 0 at row2, column0. Its Moore neighborhood:\n\nTop: row1, column0 (4)\nTop-right: row1, column1 (4)\nRight: row2, column1 (4)\nBottom-right: row3, column1 (4)\nBottom: row3, column0 (4)\nBottom-left: row3, column-1 (invalid)\nLeft: invalid (column-1)\nTop-left: row1, column-1 (invalid)\n\nSo valid neighbors: top (4), top-right (4), right (4), bottom-right (4), bottom (4). That's five 4s. But in the output, this 0 becomes 7. So maybe the rule is that any 0 with three or more 4s in its Moore neighborhood becomes 7. Because in this case, five 4s, which is more than three.\n\nBut wait, let's check other 0s that became 7. For example, in Example 1's output, row5 and row6 have 7s. Let's take row5, column5 in input example1: input row5 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]. Output row5 is [0,0,0,0,0,7,4,7,0]. So the 0 at column5 becomes 7. Let's check its neighbors:\n\nMoore neighborhood for row5, column5 (input is 0 here). \n\nTop: row4, column5 (4)\nTop-right: row4, column6 (4)\nRight: row5, column6 (4)\nBottom-right: row6, column6 (4)\nBottom: row6, column5 (4)\nBottom-left: row6, column4 (0)\nLeft: row5, column4 (0)\nTop-left: row4, column4 (0)\n\nSo surrounding 4s: top (4), top-right (4), right (4), bottom-right (4), bottom (4). Five 4s. So again, three or more. So the rule could be: any 0 cell that has three or more 4s in its Moore neighborhood (all eight adjacent cells) becomes a 7. Let's verify this against the examples.\n\nIn Example0's third row, middle 0 (row2, column1). Moore neighbors: as I calculated earlier, six 4s. So that's >=3, so becomes 7.\n\nIn Example0's fifth row, column5: three 4s, becomes 7.\n\nIn Example1's second row, column0: five 4s, becomes 7.\n\nIn Example1's row5, column5: five 4s, becomes 7.\n\nNow, let's check a 0 that doesn't change. For example, in Example0's first row is [4,4,4,0...], the 0s in columns 3 onwards. Let's take a 0 in column3 of row1. What's its Moore neighborhood?\n\nRow1, column3. Neighbors:\n\nTop: row0, column3 (0)\nTop-right: row0, column4 (0)\nRight: row1, column4 (0)\nBottom-right: row2, column4 (0)\nBottom: row2, column3 (0)\nBottom-left: row2, column2 (4)\nLeft: row1, column2 (4)\nTop-left: row0, column2 (0)\n\nSo in this case, only left and bottom-left are 4s. Two 4s. So less than 3, so stays 0. That fits.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each cell, if it's 0 and has three or more 4s in its eight surrounding cells, then it becomes 7. Otherwise, it stays as is.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's process each cell in the test input grid and check for 0s with three or more 4s around them.\n\nThe test input is:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0]\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]\n\nLet's go through each cell that is 0 and check their neighbors.\n\nStarting with row1, column4 (the 4 in the middle). But since the cell itself is 4, we ignore. Looking for 0s.\n\nLet's check row2, column4 (0). Let's see:\n\nNeighbors:\nTop: row1, column4 (4)\nTop-right: row1, column5 (0)\nRight: row2, column5 (0)\nBottom-right: row3, column5 (0)\nBottom: row3, column4 (0)\nBottom-left: row3, column3 (0)\nLeft: row2, column3 (4)\nTop-left: row1, column3 (0)\n\nSo neighbors: top (4) and left (4) \u2192 two 4s. So no change.\n\nRow2, column0 is 0. Let's check neighbors:\n\nTop: row1, column0 (0)\nTop-right: row1, column1 (0)\nRight: row2, column1 (0)\nBottom-right: row3, column1 (0)\nBottom: row3, column0 (0)\nLeft and others are out of bounds. All neighbors are 0. So no change.\n\nLooking for 0s that have three or more 4s around them.\n\nLet's check row3, column3 (0). Wait, row3 is [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So column2 is 4. Let's check some cells.\n\nRow6, column5 is 4. So in row7, column5 is 4. Let's check around row6, column5 (0 in test input). Wait, row6 is [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]. So column5 is 4. But we're looking for 0s. Let's check row6, column6 (0). Its neighbors:\n\nTop: row5, column6 (0)\nTop-right: row5, column7 (0)\nRight: row6, column7 (0)\nBottom-right: row7, column7 (4)\nBottom: row7, column6 (4)\nBottom-left: row7, column5 (4)\nLeft: row6, column5 (4)\nTop-left: row5, column5 (0)\n\nSo neighbors: left (4), bottom-left (4), bottom (4), bottom-right (4). Four 4s. So this 0 (row6, column6) would become 7.\n\nWait, but the cell is row6, column6 (0 in test input). Let me confirm. The test input's row6 is [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0], so column5 is 4, columns 6 is 0. So the cell at row6, column6 is 0. Let's check the neighbors:\n\n- Left (column5): 4\n- Bottom (row7, column6): 4 (row7 is [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0], column6 is 4)\n- Bottom-left (row7, column5): 4\n- Bottom-right (row7, column7):4\nSo four 4s. So this 0 would become 7.\n\nSimilarly, row7, column5 is 4, so no change. Let's look at other cells.\n\nLooking at row7, column7 (4), but it's a 4. Not relevant. Let's check row8, column6 (4). But it's a 4. So another candidate is row7, column8 (0), but test input row7 ends with 0. Let's check row7, column8 is 0. Neighbors:\n\nOnly left and others. Probably not enough. \n\nAnother cell to check: row3, column1 (0). Let's see:\n\nRow3 is [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Column1 is 0. Its neighbors:\n\nTop: row2, column1 (0)\nTop-right: row2, column2 (4)\nRight: row3, column2 (4)\nBottom-right: row4, column2 (0)\nBottom: row4, column1 (0)\nBottom-left: row4, column0 (0)\nLeft: row3, column0 (0)\nTop-left: row2, column0 (0)\n\nSo neighbors: top-right (4), right (4) \u2192 two 4s. Not enough.\n\nRow2, column2 is 4. Let's check adjacent 0s. For example, row2, column4 (0) as before. But only two 4s.\n\nWhat about row3, column1 (0)? As above, two 4s. No.\n\nHow about row7, column4 (0). Let's check:\n\nRow7 is [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0]. Column4 is 0.\n\nNeighbors:\nTop: row6, column4 (0)\nTop-right: row6, column5 (4)\nRight: row7, column5 (4)\nBottom-right: row8, column5 (0)\nBottom: row8, column4 (0)\nBottom-left: row8, column3 (0)\nLeft: row7, column3 (0)\nTop-left: row6, column3 (0)\n\nNeighbors: top-right (4), right (4) \u2192 two 4s. Not enough.\n\nNow, row6, column5 is 4. Let's check the 0s around it.\n\nFor example, row5, column5 (0). Let's check its neighbors:\n\nRow5 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So row5, column5 is 0.\n\nNeighbors:\nTop: row4, column5 (0)\nTop-right: row4, column6 (0)\nRight: row5, column6 (0)\nBottom-right: row6, column6 (0)\nBottom: row6, column5 (4)\nBottom-left: row6, column4 (0)\nLeft: row5, column4 (0)\nTop-left: row4, column4 (0)\n\nOnly bottom neighbor is 4. So one 4. Not enough.\n\nAnother cell: row7, column5 (4), but it's 4. So no.\n\nLooking back at row6, column6 (0) as we found earlier, it's surrounded by four 4s. So that becomes 7.\n\nNow, let's check row8, column5 (0). Row8 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]. Column5 is 0. Let's check its neighbors:\n\nTop: row7, column5 (4)\nTop-right: row7, column6 (4)\nRight: row8, column6 (4)\nBottom-right: out of bounds\nBottom: out of bounds\nBottom-left: out of bounds\nLeft: row8, column4 (0)\nTop-left: row7, column4 (0)\n\nSo neighbors: top (4), top-right (4), right (4). Three 4s. So this 0 (row8, column5) would become 7.\n\nAnother candidate: row7, column4 (0) had two 4s, so no. What about row7, column8 (0) in test input? Let's see:\n\nRow7, column8 is 0. Neighbors:\n\nLeft: row7, column7 (4)\nTop: row6, column8 (0)\nOthers are out of bounds. So only left neighbor is 4. Not enough.\n\nNow, row8, column7 (0). Row8's seventh column is 0. Let's check neighbors:\n\nTop: row7, column7 (4)\nOthers: right is out, bottom out. Left: row8, column6 (4). So two 4s. Not enough.\n\nAnother cell: row3, column3 (0). Row3 is [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Column3 is 0. Neighbors:\n\nTop: row2, column3 (4)\nTop-right: row2, column4 (0)\nRight: row3, column4 (0)\nBottom-right: row4, column4 (0)\nBottom: row4, column3 (0)\nBottom-left: row4, column2 (0)\nLeft: row3, column2 (4)\nTop-left: row2, column2 (4)\n\nSo neighbors: top (4), left (4), top-left (4). Three 4s. So this 0 (row3, column3) would become 7.\n\nSo in test input, row3, column3 is 0. Let's count:\n\nTop (row2, column3): 4\nLeft (row3, column2):4\nTop-left (row2, column2):4\nSo three 4s. So this cell becomes 7.\n\nAnother candidate: row2, column4 (0). We checked earlier, two 4s.\n\nNow, row7, column5 (4) is part of the group. Let's check 0s around it. For example, row6, column5 is 4. Not a 0. How about row6, column6 (0) as before.\n\nAnother possible cell: row8, column6 (4) is 4. So no.\n\nNow, let's check row7, column4 (0) again: two 4s. No.\n\nWhat about row4, column5 (0). Let's check:\n\nRow4 is all zeros. Column5. Neighbors:\n\nTop: row3, column5 (0)\nTop-right: row3, column6 (0)\nRight: row4, column6 (0)\nBottom-right: row5, column6 (0)\nBottom: row5, column5 (0)\nBottom-left: row5, column4 (0)\nLeft: row4, column4 (0)\nTop-left: row3, column4 (0)\n\nAll zeros. So no.\n\nSo the 0s that need to change to 7 are:\n\n- row3, column3 (three 4s)\n- row6, column6 (four 4s)\n- row8, column5 (three 4s)\n\nAre there any others?\n\nLet's check row2, column1 (0). Row2 is [0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]. Column1 is 0. Neighbors:\n\nTop: row1, column1 (0)\nTop-right: row1, column2 (0)\nRight: row2, column2 (4)\nBottom-right: row3, column2 (4)\nBottom: row3, column1 (0)\nBottom-left: row3, column0 (0)\nLeft: row2, column0 (0)\nTop-left: row1, column0 (0)\n\nSo right (4), bottom-right (4) \u2192 two 4s. Not enough.\n\nRow3, column4 (0). Neighbors:\n\nTop: row2, column4 (0)\nRight: row3, column5 (0)\nEtc. All zeros. No.\n\nAnother possible candidate: row7, column4 (0). As before, two 4s.\n\nWhat about row6, column5 is 4. So no. What about row6, column7 (0). Let's check:\n\nRow6 is [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]. Column7 is 0.\n\nNeighbors:\n\nTop: row5, column7 (0)\nTop-right: row5, column8 (0)\nRight: row6, column8 (0)\nBottom-right: row7, column8 (0)\nBottom: row7, column7 (4)\nBottom-left: row7, column6 (4)\nLeft: row6, column6 (0)\nTop-left: row5, column6 (0)\n\nSo bottom (4) and bottom-left (4). Two 4s. So no.\n\nAnother possible cell: row8, column7 (0). Neighbors: left is 4 (row8, column6 is 4), top (row7, column7 is4). So two 4s. Not enough.\n\nSo the three cells that meet the criteria are:\n\n- row3, column3 \u2192 7\n- row6, column6 \u21927\n- row8, column5 \u21927\n\nAre there any others?\n\nLet's check row5, column5 (0). In test input, row5 is all zeros. Checking neighbors:\n\nAll around are zeros. So no.\n\nWhat about row7, column3 (0). Row7: [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0]. Column3 is 0. Neighbors:\n\nTop: row6, column3 (0)\nRight: row7, column4 (0)\nBottom: row8, column3 (0)\nLeft: row7, column2 (0)\nTop-left: row6, column2 (0)\nEtc. All zeros. No 4s. So no.\n\nAnother check: row3, column4 (0). Neighbors are all zeros. No.\n\nAnother possible cell: row8, column6 (4). Not a 0.\n\nWait, what about row8, column5 (0) as we discussed. Yes. So three cells. Are there any more?\n\nAnother cell: row4, column2 (0). Let's see:\n\nRow4 is all zeros. Column2. Neighbors:\n\nTop: row3, column2 (4)\nTop-right: row3, column3 (0)\nRight: row4, column3 (0)\nBottom-right: row5, column3 (0)\nBottom: row5, column2 (0)\nBottom-left: row5, column1 (0)\nLeft: row4, column1 (0)\nTop-left: row3, column1 (0)\n\nOnly top neighbor is 4. So one 4. No change.\n\nSo the three cells to change. Let's now apply this to the test input and generate the output.\n\nOriginal test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0]\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]\n\nAfter changes:\n\nRow3, column3 (index3) becomes 7.\n\nRow6, column6 (index6) becomes7.\n\nRow8, column5 (index5) becomes7.\n\nSo the modified rows would be:\n\nRow3: [0,0,4,7,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,4,7,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,7,4,0,0]\n\nWait, let's make sure:\n\nOriginal row3: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 change index3 (0) to7 \u2192 becomes [0,0,4,7,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nOriginal row6: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0] \u2192 change index6 (0) to7 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,4,7,0,0].\n\nOriginal row8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0] \u2192 change index5 (0) to7 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,7,4,0,0].\n\nAre there any other changes? Let's see:\n\nRow7's column5 is 4. No change.\n\nRow8's column5 is now 7.\n\nIs there any other cell with three or more 4s around?\n\nWait, row7, column5 is 4. Let's check the 0 in row7, column4. Neighbors:\n\nRow7, column4: 0.\n\nNeighbors:\n\nTop: row6, column4 (0)\nTop-right: row6, column5 (4)\nRight: row7, column5 (4)\nBottom-right: row8, column5 (7, now changed)\nBottom: row8, column4 (0)\nBottom-left: row8, column3 (0)\nLeft: row7, column3 (0)\nTop-left: row6, column3 (0)\n\nSo in the original input, row7, column4's neighbors are top-right (4), right (4). So two 4s. Not enough. So no change.\n\nAnother check: row6, column6 was 0 and becomes 7. Let's check its neighbors again. In the original input, yes. But after change, the output cells are modified. However, the pattern is to apply the rule once to the original input, not iteratively. So the transformation is based on the original input's neighbor counts. So even if a cell is changed to 7, the other cells' counts are based on the original input, not the modified one. Because in the training examples, the outputs have multiple 7s added at once. So it's a single-pass transformation.\n\nSo in the test case, the three cells are the only ones to change.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out this puzzle. So, the task is to look at the training examples and find the pattern that transforms the input into the output. Then apply that pattern to the test input. \n\nFirst, let's look at Example 0. The input has a bunch of 4s and 0s. The output replaces some of the 0s with 7s. Let's compare the input and output rows to see where the 7s appear. \n\nLooking at the input of Example 0:\n\nRow 1 (index 0) is all zeros, same in output.\n\nRow 2 (index 1) is [4,4,4,0...], output is the same. \n\nRow 3 (index 2) input is [4,0,4,...], output becomes [4,7,4,...]. So the middle 0 turned into a 7. \n\nRow 4 (index3) input [0,0,4,...] becomes [7,7,4,...]. The first two 0s became 7s. \n\nThen looking at the lower part, rows 5-7 (indices4-6) in the input have 4s in certain positions. The output adds 7s around them. Like in row5 (index4) input ends with 4,4,0,0. Output has 4,4,7,0. So the next position after the 4s becomes 7. Similarly in row6 (index5), input ends with 0,4,4,0. Output becomes 7,4,4,0. Wait, no, the output for row5 (index4) input [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0] becomes [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,7,0]. So the 7 is after the two 4s. Then in row6 (index5), input [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0] becomes [0,0,0,0,0,7,4,4,0]. So the 7 is before the first 4. \n\nHmm, maybe the 7s are being placed in positions adjacent to 4s, but only under certain conditions. Let's check Example 1 as well.\n\nIn Example 1's input, row2 (index1) is [4,4,4,...], output same. Row2 (index2) input is [0,4,4,...], output becomes [7,4,4,...]. So the 0 before the 4s turns into a 7. Row3 (index3) input is [4,4,4,...], output same. Then in the lower part, rows5 and 6 (indices5-6) have inputs with 0s around 4s. The outputs here replace some 0s with 7s. Like in row5 (index5) input [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0] becomes [0,0,0,0,0,7,4,7,0]. So 7s are on both sides of the 4. \n\nPutting this together, maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a 4, any adjacent 0 (including diagonally?) becomes a 7 in the output. But wait, in Example0, row2 (index2) input [4,0,4] becomes [4,7,4]. The middle 0 is between two 4s. So maybe if a 0 is adjacent to two 4s, it turns into a 7. Or perhaps any 0 adjacent to at least one 4 becomes a 7. Let me check.\n\nIn Example0, row3 (index3) input is [0,0,4,...]. The output is [7,7,4,...]. The first two 0s are adjacent to the 4 (third position). The first 0 (position0) is only adjacent to the 4 in position2 if diagonally. Wait, maybe adjacency includes all eight directions. Let's see. The 0 in position1 (row3) is adjacent to position2 (the 4), so maybe that's why it's a 7. Then the first 0 in position0 (row3) is adjacent to the 4 in position2 of the row above (row2, which has a 4 in position0 and 2). So the 0 in row3, position0 is adjacent (upper-left?) to the 4 in row2, position0. So maybe the 7s are placed in any 0 that is adjacent (including diagonally) to at least one 4. But let's verify.\n\nIn Example0, row2's middle 0 (position1) is between two 4s (positions0 and2). So adjacent left and right. So that 0 becomes 7. In row3, positions0 and1: position0 in row3 is below row2's position0 (4) and diagonally adjacent to row2's position0. So maybe that's why it's 7. Position1 in row3 is adjacent to row2's position1 (which was a 0) and row3's position2 (4). So position1 in row3 is adjacent to the 4 in same row, position2. Thus, becomes 7. \n\nIn Example1, row2 (index2) input is [0,4,4]. Output [7,4,4]. The first 0 (position0) is adjacent to position1 (4) in same row, so becomes 7. \n\nIn the lower part of Example1's output, rows5 and 6 (indices5 and6) have 7s around the 4s. For example, in row5 (index5), the 4 is in position6, and the output has 7 in position5 and7. So adjacent left and right. But the input was [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]. So the 4 is at position6. The 0 at position5 (left) and position7 (right) become 7s. Also, maybe diagonally above and below? For example, row5's 4 at position6: the cell above is row4's position6 (which is 4) and below is row6's position6 (4). So those are 4s. So maybe the 0s adjacent (including diagonally) to any 4 become 7s. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each 0 in the input grid, if it is adjacent (including diagonally) to any 4, then replace it with 7. Otherwise, leave it as 0. Let's check the examples again.\n\nIn Example0's input row3 (index3) [0,0,4,...]. The two 0s in positions0 and1: position0 in row3 is adjacent to row2's position0 (4) and row3's position1 (0). So adjacent to a 4 (row2's position0). So becomes 7. Position1 in row3 is adjacent to row3's position2 (4). So becomes 7. So yes, in output, both are 7s. \n\nWhat about in Example0's row4 (index4) input: [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0]. The output has 7 in position7. The 0s in positions7 and8. Position7 in input is adjacent to 4s in positions5 and6 (same row). So adjacent to two 4s. So becomes 7. But position8 is 0 in output. Because position8 is adjacent to position7 (0 in input) and maybe no 4s nearby. Wait, in input, position8 is 0. Adjacent cells would be position7 (0), and the row below's position8 (0). So no 4s. So stays 0. So that's why output has 7 in position7 and 0 in position8. \n\nIn Example1's row5 (index5) output, the 4 at position6 in input has 0s at positions5 and7. These 0s are adjacent to the 4 (same row) so become 7s. Also, in row6 (index6) input's 4 at position6: the 0s at position5 and7 (same row) become 7s. \n\nSo the rule is: replace any 0 with 7 if it is adjacent (in any direction, including diagonally) to a 4. Then the output is the same as input, but with all 0s adjacent to 4s replaced by 7. \n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the training examples. \n\nIn Example0's row2 (index2) input [4,0,4,...], the middle 0 is between two 4s, so adjacent to both. Output is 7. Correct. \n\nIn Example1's row2 (index2) input [0,4,4,...], the 0 at position0 is adjacent to 4 at position1. So becomes 7. Correct. \n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: all 0s \u2192 remains 0s.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]. The 4 is at position4. The adjacent cells around it (positions3,5 in same row; positions3,4,5 in row0 above and row2 below). So any 0s adjacent to this 4 should become 7. Let's see:\n\nIn row1, positions3 and5: in same row, adjacent to 4. So they should be 7. But also, in row0, positions3,4,5 (but row0 is all 0s). Wait, the 4 is in row1, position4. So the cells around it are:\n\n- row0: positions3,4,5 (row above)\n- row1: positions3 and5 (same row)\n- row2: positions3,4,5 (row below)\n\nBut looking at row1's input, the 4 is at position4. So in row0, positions3,4,5 are all 0. So those would become 7? Wait, but in the training examples, the 7s are only in the output where there were 0s in input adjacent to 4s. So for the test input row1's 4 at (1,4):\n\n- The cell above is row0, column4 (0) \u2192 becomes 7.\n- The cell below is row2, column4 (0 in input?), let's check row2 in test input: [0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]. So row2, column4 is 0. So adjacent to the 4 in row1. So becomes 7.\n\nWait, but let's check all cells around the 4 in row1, column4 (1,4). All 8 directions:\n\n- (0,3): 0 \u2192 becomes 7\n- (0,4): 0 \u2192 becomes7\n- (0,5): 0 \u2192 becomes7\n- (1,3): 0 \u2192 becomes7\n- (1,5): 0 \u2192 becomes7\n- (2,3): 4 (row2, column3 is 4)\n- (2,4): 0 \u2192 becomes7\n- (2,5): 0 \u2192 becomes7\n\nWait, but the 4 at (1,4) in row1. So the adjacent cells are:\n\nTop-left: (0,3) \u2192 0 \u2192 becomes7\n\nTop: (0,4) \u21920\u21927\n\nTop-right: (0,5) \u21920\u21927\n\nLeft: (1,3) \u21920\u21927\n\nRight: (1,5) \u21920\u21927\n\nBottom-left: (2,3) \u21924 (so no change here, since that's a 4)\n\nBottom: (2,4) \u21920\u21927\n\nBottom-right: (2,5) \u21920\u21927\n\nSo in row0, positions3,4,5 become 7. Row1, positions3 and5 become7. Row2, positions3 (4 remains),4 and5 become7.\n\nBut looking at the original test input, let's see:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 after processing, the 4 in row1 affects row0's columns3-5. So row0 would become [0,0,0,7,7,7,0,0,0]?\n\nWait, but wait: in the training examples, the output only changes 0s that are adjacent to 4s. So in row0, the cells (0,3), (0,4), (0,5) are adjacent to the 4 at (1,4). So those should become 7. So row0's output would have 7s at positions3,4,5.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, when there's a 4 in row1, the row above (row0) gets 7s in the adjacent positions. For example, in Example0's row1 (4,4,4...), the row2 (index1) is [4,4,4,0...], and the row2 in output is same. Wait no. Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe in the training examples, the 7s are added only in the same row and the rows below. For example, in Example0, the 4s in row1 (index1) are in the top part. The 7s in row2 and 3 (indices2 and3) are below those 4s. Similarly, in the lower part, the 4s are in rows4,5,6, and the 7s are in the same rows and adjacent. \n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that 0s adjacent (including diagonally) to 4s are replaced by 7s, but only in the same or lower rows? No, because in Example0's row3 (index3) there's a 7 in position0, which is adjacent to row2's position0 (4). So it's in the row below. So the adjacency includes all directions. \n\nSo in the test input's row1 (index1) 4 at position4, the 7s would be in row0's positions3-5 (above), row1's positions3 and5 (same row), and row2's positions3-5 (below). However, row2's input is [0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]. So position3 and4 in row2: position3 is 4, position4 is 0. So the 0 at row2, position4 would become 7. Position5 is 0, so becomes7. But position3 is already a 4, so remains. \n\nBut let's process each cell in the test input one by one. \n\nLet's go through each cell in the test input and check if it's a 0 and adjacent to any 4. If yes, replace with 7; else remains 0.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: all 0s.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: all 0s.\n\nRow5: all 0s.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]\n\nNow, process each cell:\n\nStarting from row0:\n\nEach cell in row0 is 0. Check adjacent cells. For example, cell (0,0): check neighbors in all 8 directions. But since it's row0, top rows don't exist. So neighbors are row0's (0,1), row1's (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Are any of these 4? Let's check:\n\nRow1's (0,0) is 0. (0,1) is 0. (1,0) is 0. (1,1) is 0. So no 4s adjacent. So (0,0) remains 0.\n\nSimilarly for (0,3): check if any adjacent cells have 4. The cell (0,3) is adjacent to row1's (0,3) which is 0, row1's (0,4) which is 4. Wait, cell (0,3) in row0: its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (0-1,3-1) = (-1,2) invalid\n- (0-1,3) = (-1,3) invalid\n- (0-1,3+1) = (-1,4) invalid\n- (0,2), (0,4)\n- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n\nWait, cell (0,3)'s eight neighbors:\n\nTop-left: row-1, column2 \u2192 invalid\nTop: row-1, column3 \u2192 invalid\nTop-right: row-1, column4 \u2192 invalid\nLeft: (0,2)\nRight: (0,4)\nBottom-left: (1,2)\nBottom: (1,3)\nBottom-right: (1,4)\n\nNow, in test input:\n\n(0,3) in row0:\n\n(0,2) is 0\n(0,4) is 0\n(1,2) is 0\n(1,3) is 0\n(1,4) is 4 (from row1)\nSo (0,3) is adjacent to a 4 (cell (1,4)). So (0,3) should become7.\n\nSimilarly, (0,4) in row0: adjacent to (1,4) which is 4 \u2192 becomes7.\n\n(0,5) in row0: adjacent to (1,4) (diagonally), which is 4 \u2192 becomes7.\n\nSo row0's output would be [0,0,0,7,7,7,0,0,0].\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nProcessing each cell:\n\n(1,0): 0. Check neighbors. Adjacent cells include row0's (0,0), (0,1), row1's (0,1), (2,0), etc. None are 4. So remains 0.\n\n(1,3): 0. Adjacent cells include (1,4) which is4 \u2192 becomes7.\n\n(1,4):4 \u2192 remains4.\n\n(1,5):0. Adjacent to (1,4) \u21927.\n\nOther cells in row1:\n\n(1,0-2): adjacent to no 4s. So 0 remains.\n\nSo row1's output becomes [0,0,0,7,4,7,0,0,0].\n\nRow2: [0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nProcessing each cell:\n\n(2,0):0. Check neighbors. Adjacent cells include row1's (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), etc. None are 4. So 0.\n\n(2,1):0. Adjacent to (2,2)=4 (same row), so becomes7.\n\n(2,2)=4: remains.\n\n(2,3)=4: remains.\n\n(2,4)=0. Adjacent to (1,4)=4 (above), (2,3)=4 (left), (2,5)=0, (3,3)=4 (below), (3,4)=0. So adjacent to two 4s. So becomes7.\n\n(2,5)=0. Adjacent to (2,4)=0, (3,5)=0. But (1,4)=4 is diagonally adjacent (row1, column4). So (2,5) is adjacent to (1,4) (diagonally). So yes, becomes7.\n\nOther cells in row2: positions6-8 are 0. Check if any adjacent 4s. For example, (2,6)=0. Adjacent to (2,5)=0 (now 7?), but in input it's 0. Wait, but we need to check the original input. The transformation is applied based on the input, not the modified output. So during processing, each cell's state is based on the original input.\n\nSo for (2,6)=0: adjacent cells in original input:\n\nUp: row1, column6 (0)\nLeft: row2, column5 (0)\nDown: row3, column6 (0)\nDiagonals: row1,5 (0), row3,5 (0), etc. So no 4s. So remains0.\n\nSo row2's output:\n\n[0,7,4,4,7,7,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nProcessing:\n\n(3,0)=0: no adjacent 4s \u21920.\n\n(3,1)=0: adjacent to row2's (2,1)=0 (original input is 0), row3's (3,2)=4. So adjacent to 4 \u2192 becomes7.\n\n(3,2)=4 \u21924.\n\n(3,3)=0: adjacent to row2's (2,3)=4 (above), row3's (3,2)=4 (left), row4's (4,3)=0. So adjacent to two 4s \u21927.\n\n(3,4)=0: adjacent to row2's (2,4)=0 (now, in input, row2's (2,4) was 0, but adjacent to row3's (3,3)=0 (input is 0). So no 4s \u2192 remains0.\n\nOther positions in row3: positions4-8 are 0. Check for adjacent 4s.\n\nFor example, (3,5)=0: adjacent cells include row2's (2,5)=0, row3's (3,4)=0, row4's (4,5)=0. No 4s. So remains0.\n\nSo row3's output: [0,7,4,7,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: all 0s. Check each cell for adjacent 4s.\n\nFor example, (4,2)=0: adjacent to row3's (3,2)=4 (above) \u2192 becomes7.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3)=0: adjacent to row3's (3,3)=7 (but in original input, row3's (3,3) is 0. Wait, no. Wait, during processing, all adjacency checks are based on the original input, not the transformed output. So row3's input is [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So (4,2) is adjacent to row3's (3,2)=4 \u2192 yes. So (4,2) becomes7. \n\n(4,3)=0: adjacent to row3's (3,3)=0. So no \u2192 remains0.\n\nSo row4's cells:\n\nLooking for any 0 adjacent to 4 in original input. For example:\n\n(4,2) is below row3's (3,2)=4 \u2192 becomes7.\n\nOther cells in row4: (4,0-1,3-8) are 0. Check adjacent cells.\n\nFor example, (4,1) adjacent to row3's (3,1)=0 (input), row4's (4,0)=0, (4,2)=0 (input), and row5's (5,1)=0. So no 4s. So remains0.\n\nSo row4's output: [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: all 0s. Check each cell. For example, (5,2)=0: adjacent to row4's (4,2)=0 (original is 0), row6's (6,2)=0. No 4s. So remains0. Similarly, other cells. But wait, row6 has a 4 in position5. Let's see:\n\nRow5's cells adjacent to row6's 4s?\n\nRow6's input is [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]. So (6,5)=4.\n\nCells in row5 that are adjacent to (6,5):\n\n(5,4) (same column, one row above), (5,5) (same row, below?), wait adjacency includes all directions. So for row5's cell (5,5): below row5 is row6, so (6,5) is 4. So (5,5) is adjacent to (6,5) \u2192 becomes7.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is adjacent to (6,5) (diagonally). So (5,4) becomes7.\n\n(5,6) is adjacent to (6,5) (diagonally). So (5,6) becomes7.\n\nSo in row5:\n\n(5,4), (5,5), (5,6) would be adjacent to row6's (6,5)=4 \u2192 they are 0s in input. So they become7.\n\nSo row5's output: [0,0,0,0,7,7,7,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]\n\nProcessing:\n\n(6,5)=4 \u2192 remains4.\n\nAdjacent cells in row6:\n\n(6,4)=0 \u2192 adjacent to 4 (same row) \u21927.\n\n(6,6)=0 \u2192 adjacent to 4 (left) \u21927.\n\nAlso, check above and below. For (6,5), cells above are row5's (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). Which we already handled.\n\nRow6's cells:\n\n(6,4) becomes7.\n\n(6,5)=4.\n\n(6,6)=7.\n\nOther positions: (6,0-3,7-8) are 0. Check adjacency.\n\nFor example, (6,3)=0: adjacent to row5's (5,3)=0, row6's (6,2)=0, row7's (7,3)=0. No 4s. So remains0.\n\nSo row6's output: [0,0,0,0,7,4,7,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0]\n\nProcessing each cell:\n\n(7,5)=4, (7,6)=4, (7,7)=4.\n\nAdjacent 0s:\n\nFor example, (7,4)=0: adjacent to (7,5)=4 \u21927.\n\n(7,8)=0: adjacent to (7,7)=4 \u21927.\n\nAlso, cells above (row6) like (6,4)=7 (but in original input, row6's (6,5) is4. Wait, during processing, we check original input. So row7's (7,5) is4. So cells around it:\n\n(7,4)=0 \u2192 adjacent to 4 \u21927.\n\n(7,6)=4 \u2192 remains.\n\n(7,7)=4 \u2192 remains.\n\nOther positions:\n\n(7,0-3)=0. Check if adjacent to any 4s. For example, (7,3)=0: adjacent to row6's (6,3)=0, row7's (7,4)=0 (input is 0), row8's (8,3)=0. No 4s. So remains0.\n\n(7,4)=0 \u2192 becomes7.\n\n(7,8)=0 \u2192 adjacent to (7,7)=4 \u21927.\n\nSo row7's output: [0,0,0,0,7,4,4,4,7]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]\n\nProcessing:\n\n(8,6)=4 \u2192 remains.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n(8,5)=0 \u2192 adjacent to (8,6)=4 \u21927.\n\n(8,7)=0 \u2192 adjacent to (8,6)=4 \u21927.\n\nAlso, row7's (7,5)=4, (7,6)=4, (7,7)=4. So for (8,5), it's below (7,5)=4 \u2192 becomes7.\n\nSimilarly, (8,7) is below (7,7)=4 \u2192 becomes7.\n\nOther cells in row8: positions0-5 (except5) and 8.\n\nFor example, (8,5)=0 becomes7.\n\n(8,7)=0 becomes7.\n\nSo row8's output: [0,0,0,0,0,7,4,7,0]\n\nPutting all rows together:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,7,7,7,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,7,4,7,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,7,4,4,7,7,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,7,4,7,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,7,7,7,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,7,4,7,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,7,4,4,4,7]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,7,4,7,0]\n\nLet's verify if this matches the pattern from training examples. \n\nFor example, in the test input's row2, the 4s in positions2 and3, the adjacent 0s become7s. Similarly, row6's 4 in position5 has adjacent 0s turned to7. \n\nThis seems to follow the pattern where 0s adjacent to 4s become7s, considering all eight directions. \n\nSo the final output should be as described above.",
