        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists to the output lists in the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input. \n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input and output are almost the same, but there are some changes. Let me compare them row by row. \n\nIn the input of Example 0, the rows are mostly 0s and some 8s. The output has some rows where after the 8s, there's a bunch of 1s starting. For instance, row 8 in the output is [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1], which in the input was all 0s. Similarly, row 12 in the output becomes [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which was all 0s in the input. \n\nWait, how did those 1s get there? Let me check the surrounding rows. Maybe there's a relationship between the 8s in a row and the 1s in a subsequent row. Let me see:\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nRow 3 in input is [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. Then in the output, row 8 (which is a few rows below) becomes the 1s. Similarly, row 7 in input is [0,0,0,8,0,...], and row 12 in output starts with 0s and then 1s.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a vertical component. Like, for each 8 in a row, the same position but a certain number of rows below turns into a 1. Let's check.\n\nTake row 3 in input (index 3 if starting from 0?), which has 8s starting at position 3. Then row 8 in output (which is 5 rows below) has 1s starting at position 4. Wait, the positions don't exactly line up. Maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added based on the presence of 8s in the previous rows. Let's look at another example.\n\nExample 1's input has a row with all 8s (row 2), and in the output, rows 6, 11, 13 have 1s. For instance, row 6 in input is [8,8,8,0,0...], and in output, it's [8,8,8,1,1...]. So starting after the 8s, the 0s become 1s. Wait, no, in the output, the row 6's 0s are replaced by 1s starting from position 3. But in the input row 6, the first three are 8s, then 0s. So maybe the 0s after the 8s in the same row are converted to 1s in the output? But in Example 0, row 3 in input has all 8s starting at position 3, but in output, row 3 remains the same. However, in row 8 of output, which was all 0s in input, there are 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's a vertical shift. Let's check Example 0. In the input, rows 6,7,8 are:\n\nRow 6: [8,8,8,0,0...]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,8,0...]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0...]\n\nIn the output, row 8 becomes [0,0,0,0,1,1...]. So the 8s in row 7 (position 3) might cause the 1s in row 8 starting at position 4. But the 8 in row 7 is at position 3, and the 1s start at position 4. Maybe each 8 in a row causes the next row to have 1s starting at the next position. Or maybe there's a diagonal element here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed a certain number of rows below the 8s. Let's see in Example 0. The 8 in row 1 (positions 0 and 1) and row 2 (position 2) and row 3 (positions 3-9). The 1s in row 8 start at position 4, and in row 12 at position 3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has some alternating 8s and 0s. In the output, some 0s turn into 1s in a pattern. For instance, row 6 in input is [8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and output row 6 becomes [8,0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]. So every even index starting from 4 becomes 1. Similarly, row 7 input is [0,8,0,0,0...], output is [0,8,0,1,0,1...]. So maybe after the 8s, the next positions alternate with 1s. But how does this relate to other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions that are a certain distance to the right of where the 8s are in the same column but in previous rows.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that whenever there's an 8 in a particular position, a certain number of rows below that position (like 5 rows below), the same column is replaced with 1. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 0, input row 1 has 8s in positions 0 and 1. In the output, row 8 (which is 7 rows below) has 1s starting at position 4. That doesn't align. Maybe not.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for any 1s in the output and see if there's a corresponding 8 in the input in the same column, but higher up.\n\nTake Example 0's output row 8: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]. The 1s start at position 4. Are there any 8s in column 4 in the input rows above? Let's check input rows:\n\nRow 3 in input has 8s starting at column 3. So column 4 has an 8 in row 3. Then, in the output row 8, which is 5 rows below row 3, the 1s start at column 4. Maybe the 1s are placed 5 rows below the 8s.\n\nRow 3 (input) has 8s from column 3 to 9. In output row 8 (which is row index 8, so 5 rows below row 3?), columns 4-9 are 1s. Wait, that's a shift of 5 rows. But why columns 4-9? The original 8s in row 3 are from column 3. So perhaps the 1s are shifted by 5 rows and 1 column to the right? That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in the same column but 5 rows below the 8s. Let's check:\n\nRow 3, column 3: 8. Then in row 8 (5 rows below), column 3 is 0. But in row 8, the 1s start at column 4. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in the same column but 5 rows below, but only if there's an 8 in that column in any of the previous rows. For example, in Example 0's output row 8, columns 4-9 are 1s. Let's check if in the input, columns 4-9 have 8s in any row above row 8. Row 3 has 8s from columns 3-9. So columns 4-9 in row 3 have 8s. If we add 5 rows to row 3 (row 3 +5 = row 8), then in row 8, columns 4-9 become 1s. But why columns 4-9 and not 3-9? Because in row 3, column 3 has an 8, but in row 8, column 3 is 0. That's inconsistent.\n\nWait, maybe the 1s are shifted one column to the right for each row below. For example, if an 8 is in row x, column y, then in row x + n, column y + n, it becomes a 1. Let me test this.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow 3 (x=3) has 8s starting at column 3 (y=3). If n=5 (rows below), then y + n = 3 +5=8. But in output row 8 (x=8), the 1s start at column 4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, n could be the number of rows between the 8 and the 1. For example, if an 8 is in row x, then in row x + k, the same column becomes 1. Let's see for Example 0.\n\nLooking at output row 8 (which is input row 8, but input row 8 was all zeros). The 1s start at column 4. Let's check input rows above. Row 3 has 8s starting at column 3. If we add 5 rows (from row 3 to 8), maybe column 3+5=8? But in row 8, column 4 is the first 1. That doesn't add up. Maybe this approach isn't right.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 1s are added in the same column where there was an 8 in the previous row, but offset by a certain number. For example, if an 8 is in row i, column j, then in row i+5, column j+1, a 1 is placed. But this seems arbitrary. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, input row 3 (i=3) has 8s starting at column 3. So j=3. i+5=8 (row 8). j+1=4. So in row 8, starting at column 4, we have 1s. That matches. Similarly, input row 7 (i=7) has an 8 at column 3. i+5=12. j=3+1=4. So in row 12, column 4. But in output row 12, the 1s start at column 3. Wait, no. Output row 12 is [0,0,0,1,1,1...]. So starting at column 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the offset is different. Let's see another example.\n\nIn Example 1's input, row 2 (i=2) has all 8s. Then in the output, row 6 (i=6) has [8,8,8,1,1...]. Wait, the 1s start at column 3. So i=2 to i=6 is a difference of 4 rows. j=0,1,2 in row 2. So maybe 8s in row 2, columns 0-9. Then in row 6, columns 3-9 become 1s. How does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's not based on the rows but some other pattern. Let's look at the overall structure. The outputs in the examples have some rows where after the 8s, there's a run of 1s. But in some cases, the 1s are in a different row. For example, in Example 0's output, row 8 has 1s starting at column 4. The input rows above that have 8s in row 3 (columns 3-9) and row 7 (column 3). So maybe the 1s are appearing in columns after the last 8 in the previous rows, but in a different row.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the 1s are added in the next possible row where there's a sequence of zeros, starting from the column where an 8 ends. For example, if a row has 8s up to column x, then in the next possible row below, starting at column x+1, there are 1s. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 3: 8s start at column 3 and go to column 9. The first available row below that (row 4) is all zeros. But the output row 8 is where the 1s appear. So this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a matter of the sum of 8s in a column. If a column has a certain number of 8s in the input, then in the output, some rows below have 1s. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's output. The input has some 8s in a checkerboard pattern. In the output, some of the 0s turn into 1s in a similar checkerboard but shifted. For example, row 6 in input has 8s at positions 0, 2, 4, etc. Output row 6 has 1s at positions 4,6,8. So perhaps the 1s are shifted two positions to the right. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a matter of each 8 in a row causing a 1 to appear in the same column, five rows below. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input row 3, column 3 is 8. Then output row 8 (3+5=8), column 3+1=4? But in row 8, the 1 starts at column 4. So maybe 8 in row i, column j becomes 1 in row i+5, column j+1. Let's test.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 7 (i=7), column 3 is 8. Then i+5=12. j+1=4. Output row 12 has 1s starting at column 3. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in the same column, but 5 rows below. For row 3, column 3, 5 rows below would be row 8. Output row 8, column 3 is 0. No, but the 1s start at column 4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the changes between input and output for each example.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nOutput rows 8 and 12 have new 1s. The other rows are same as input. So rows 8 and 12 in output are modified. Let's see what's in the input for those rows. Input row 8 is all 0s. Output row 8 has 1s starting at column 4. Input row 12 is all 0s. Output row 12 has 1s starting at column 3. \n\nWhat's above those rows in the input? For row 8 in output: looking up 5 rows (since 8-3=5), row 3 in input has 8s starting at column 3. Maybe the 1s start at column 3+1=4, row 8. Similarly, row 12 in output: looking up 5 rows from row 12 is row 7. Row 7 in input has 8 at column 3. So 3+1=4, but in output row 12, it's column 3. Hmm, that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a shift based on the number of rows between the 8 and the 1. For example, for each 8 in row i, column j, in the output, row i + k, column j + m becomes 1. Maybe k=5 and m=1. Let's test.\n\nIn Example 0, row 3 (i=3), columns 3-9 have 8s. Then in row 3+5=8, columns 3+1=4 and beyond become 1s. That's exactly what's happening in row 8 of the output. Similarly, in row 7 (i=7), column 3 has 8. Then in row 7+5=12, column 3+1=4. But output row 12 has 1s starting at column 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe this isn't the pattern.\n\nWait, but in row 7, the 8 is at column 3. If m=0, then row 7+5=12, column 3 becomes 1. But in output row 12, the 1s start at column 3, which matches. So maybe for each 8 in row i, column j, in row i+5, column j, set to 1. \n\nTesting this:\n\nExample 0:\n\nRow 3, columns 3-9 are 8s. So in row 3+5=8, columns 3-9 should be 1s. But output row 8 has 1s from column 4 to 9. So that's one column off. Why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is i+5 and j remains the same. For row 3, column 3: row 8, column 3. But output row 8 has 0 in column 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try another angle. Let's think about the 1s in the outputs. In Example 0's output, the 1s are in rows 8 and 12. In Example 1's output, the 1s are in rows 6, 11, 13. In Example 2's output, 1s are in rows 6,7,10,11. \n\nLooking for a pattern in the row numbers where 1s appear. Maybe the rows with 1s are 5 rows after rows that have 8s in the input. For example:\n\nIn Example 0, input rows 3 and 7 have 8s. Adding 5 rows: 3+5=8, 7+5=12. Those are the rows with 1s in the output. That fits.\n\nIn Example 1's input, rows 2,6,11 have 8s. Adding 5: 2+5=7 (but output row 6 has 1s), 6+5=11, 11+5=16 (which is beyond the test input rows). Wait, Example 1's output rows with 1s are 6, 11,13. Hmm, maybe not exactly 5.\n\nWait Example 1's input row 2 is all 8s. Output row 6 has 1s. 2 to 6 is a difference of 4. Row 6 in input is [8,8,8,0...]. Output row 6 becomes [8,8,8,1...]. So the 1s start at column 3. So maybe for each row with 8s, the same row in the output has 1s after the 8s? But in the input, row 6 has 8s up to column 2, and in output, columns 3-9 are 1s. So that's converting 0s to 1s in the same row, after the 8s. But that doesn't fit other examples. Like in Example 0's input row 3 has 8s up to column 9, but output row 3 is the same. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 1s are added in the same row but shifted, but that doesn't fit Example 0's changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a combination of vertical and horizontal shifts. For example, each 8 in the input causes a diagonal of 1s to the right and down. But how?\n\nIn Example 0's output row 8, the 1s start at column 4. If the 8s are in row 3, column 3, then moving 5 rows down (to row 8) and 1 column right (to column 4), that's a diagonal shift. Similarly, in Example 1's input row 2 (all 8s), then in row 6, columns 3-9 are 1s. So row 2+4=6, column 0+3=3. So 4 rows down and 3 columns right. But why 4 and 3? That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each 8 in row i, column j, the 1s are placed in row i + (some number), column j + (some number). But the examples don't show a consistent pattern. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's see what all the training examples have in common. \n\nIn all outputs, the 1s are added in certain rows where the input had all 0s. The 1s form consecutive sequences starting from a certain column. \n\nLooking at Example 0: The 1s are added in row 8 starting at column 4, and row 12 starting at column 3. \n\nExample 1: The 1s are added in row 6 starting at column 3, row 11 starting at column 4, row 13 starting at column 2. \n\nExample 2: 1s are added in rows 6 and 7, starting at column 4, etc. \n\nWhat's common about the starting columns of the 1s? Maybe the starting column is the number of 8s in the previous rows. Or perhaps the starting column is determined by the position of the 8s in a previous row. \n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output row 8, the 1s start at column 4. The input row 3 has 8s starting at column 3, which is one less than the starting column of the 1s. Similarly, in Example 1's output row 6, the 1s start at column 3, which is after the 8s in row 2 (columns 0-9), but row 6 in the input has 8s in columns 0-2, and then 1s start at 3. So maybe in the same row, after the 8s, the 0s are replaced with 1s. But in Example 0's input row 3 has all 8s up to column 9, but output row 3 is unchanged. So that doesn't fit. \n\nWait, perhaps the 1s are added in the same row but in the columns to the right of where the 8s end. But in Example 0's row 3, the 8s end at column 9, so there's no room. However, in row 6 of Example 1's input, the 8s are in columns 0-2. Then in the output, columns 3-9 are 1s. That fits. Similarly, Example 2's input row 6 has 8s at columns 0,2,4. In the output, columns 4,6,8 become 1s. So after the 8s, maybe every other 0 becomes a 1. Or maybe the 1s start where the 8s left off. For Example 1's row 6, after the 8s (columns 0-2), the next columns (3-9) become 1s. That would explain Example 1's row 6 and 11. \n\nBut how does that explain Example 0's output rows 8 and 12? Those rows were all 0s in the input. So this pattern doesn't apply. So maybe there are multiple rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation has two parts:\n\n1. For any row that contains 8s followed by 0s, replace the 0s with 1s. \n\nThis would explain Example 1's row 6: 8,8,8,0,0... becomes 8,8,8,1,1...\n\nSimilarly, Example 0's row 3 is all 8s, so no 0s to replace. But rows 8 and 12 in Example 0's output were all 0s in input. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAnother part of the pattern must be responsible for those.\n\n2. For rows that are all 0s in the input, if there's an 8 in the same column but 5 rows above, replace the 0 with a 1.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's row 8 (all 0s), if there's an 8 in row 3 (5 rows above), then starting at column 4, the 1s appear. Wait, but row 3 has 8s from column 3. 3+5=8 rows? Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if an 8 is in column j in row i, then in row i+5, column j becomes 1. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0:\n\nRow 3, column 3 has 8. Then row 8, column 3 would have 1. But in the output, row 8 starts 1s at column 4. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, column j+1. Row 3, column 3: row 8, column 4. Which matches. Similarly, row 7, column 3: row 12, column 4. But in output row 12, 1s start at column 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Let's look for another pattern. \n\nNotice that in all training examples, the 1s form a contiguous block starting from a certain column. For example, in Example 0, row 8 has 1s from column 4 to 9. In Example 1, row 6 has 1s from column 3. Example 2's row 6 has 1s starting at column 4 in a checkerboard pattern. \n\nMaybe the starting column of the 1s is determined by the number of 8s in the preceding rows. For example, in Example 0's row 8, there were 8s in rows 1, 2,3, etc. The count might determine the starting column. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting column of the 1s is one more than the maximum column index of the 8s in the previous rows. For example, in Example 0's row 3, the maximum column with 8 is 9. Then row 8's 1s start at 9+1=10, but that's beyond the array. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, the starting column is determined by the number of 8s in a particular way. \n\nAnother idea: Let's think about each column. For each column j in the input, if there's an 8 in row i, then in row i + k, column j becomes 1. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, column 3 has 8 in row 3. If k=5, then row 8, column 3 would be 1. But in output row 8, column 3 is 0. However, column 4 starts the 1s. So maybe column j +1. \n\nBut this seems inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in the same column as the 8, but shifted down by 5 rows. Let's test:\n\nIn Example 0's row 3, column 3 has 8. So 3+5=8 rows, column 3. Output row 8, column 3 is 0. Doesn't fit. \n\nIn Example 1's row 2, column 0 has 8. 2+5=7 rows. Output row 7 has 0 in column 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's see if the 1s are forming a diagonal pattern. For example, in Example 2's output, the 1s are placed in a diagonal pattern where each 8 in the input leads to a 1 in the same column but a few rows down and to the right. But I'm not seeing a clear diagonal.\n\nWait, in Example 2's output row 6, the 1s are at columns 4,6,8. The input row 6 has 8s at 0,2,4. So for each 8 in column 4, the 1 is at column 4+0=4 in row 6. But why here? \n\nAlternatively, maybe for each 8 in a row, the next row has 1s shifted right by one. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's output, the 1s start at column 4 in row 8. The input rows above row 8 have 8s in columns 3 (row 3) and 3 (row 7). Maybe the starting column is determined by the number of 8s in the previous rows. For example, if there are two 8s in column 3, then the 1s start at column 3+2=5. But in Example 0's row 8, it's column 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the starting column for the 1s is the number of rows between the current row and the row where the 8 was. For example, if an 8 is in row i, then in row j, the starting column is j - i. \n\nIn Example 0's row 8: the 8 in row 3 (i=3) would lead to j - i = 8-3=5, so starting column 5. But in output row 8, it's column 4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, j - i + some offset.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Let's try to find a rule that fits all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput row 3 has 8s from column 3 to 9.\n\nOutput row 8 (5 rows below) has 1s from column 4 to 9.\n\nInput row 7 has 8 at column 3.\n\nOutput row 12 (5 rows below) has 1s from column 3 to 9.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput row 2 has 8s from 0 to 9.\n\nOutput row 6 (4 rows below) has 1s from column 3 to 9.\n\nInput row 6 has 8s from 0 to 2.\n\nOutput row 11 (5 rows below) has 1s from column 4 to 9.\n\nInput row 11 has 8s from 0 to 3.\n\nOutput row 13 (2 rows below) has 1s from column 2 to 9.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput row 6 has 8s at columns 0,2,4.\n\nOutput row 6 has 1s at columns 4,6,8.\n\nInput row 7 has 8 at column 1.\n\nOutput row 7 has 1s at column 3,5,7,9.\n\nHmm. It seems that the starting column of the 1s is the number of rows between the current row and the row where the 8s were, plus some value.\n\nAlternatively, the starting column is the number of rows below the 8 row multiplied by a factor. For example, in Example 0, row 8 is 5 rows below row 3. 5-1=4. So starting column 4. In Example 1, row 6 is 4 rows below row 2. 4-1=3. Starting column 3. For row 11 in Example 1, which is 5 rows below row 6: 5-1=4. Starting column 4. For row 13, which is 2 rows below row 11: 2-1=1. Starting column 4+1=5? But in Example 1's row 13, the starting column is 2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the starting column is the number of rows below the 8 row. In Example 0's row 8 (5 rows below row 3), starting column 4 (5-1). Example 1's row 6 (4 rows below row 2), starting column 3 (4-1). Row 11 (5 rows below row 6), starting column 4 (5-1). Row 13 (2 rows below row 11), starting column 2 (2-0). This doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the starting column of the 1s in each output row and the corresponding input rows. For example:\n\nExample 0, row 8 in output has 1s starting at column 4. The input row 3 (5 rows above) has 8s starting at column 3. So column increases by 1. \n\nExample 0, row 12 in output has 1s starting at column 3. Input row 7 (5 rows above) has 8 at column 3. Column remains the same. \n\nExample 1, row 6 in output starts at 3. Input row 2 (4 rows above) starts at 0. Not matching. \n\nExample 1, row 11 starts at 4. Input row 6 (5 rows above) starts at 0. Not matching. \n\nExample 2, row 6 in output starts at 4. Input row 6 has 8s at 0,2,4. So the 1s start at the next even column after the last 8. So 4 is the last 8 in row 6, then 6,8 become 1s. That could be a pattern: alternating 0s and 1s after the last 8. But how does this apply to other examples?\n\nIn Example 0's output row 8, the 1s start at column 4. Input row 3 has 8s up to column 9. So perhaps after the last 8, there are no columns left, but the 1s start at column 4. Doesn't fit. \n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of the simplest possible pattern. \n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that the 1s are added in rows that are 5 below any row containing 8s. For each 8 in a row, five rows below, the same column and the next columns become 1s. \n\nFor example:\n\nIn Example 0, row 3 has 8s from column 3. Five rows below is row 8. So starting from column 3, the 1s are added. But in output row 8, the 1s start at column 4. So maybe shifted by one column.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s in the row determines how many columns of 1s are added. For example, row 3 has 7 8s (columns 3-9), so in row 8, 7 columns of 1s starting at column 4. But why column 4?\n\nAlternatively, the starting column is the row index difference plus some value. For example, row 3 to row 8: difference of 5. Starting column 5-1=4. \n\nRow 7 to row 12: difference of 5. Starting column 5-2=3. \n\nThis seems to fit for Example 0. Row 3 (difference 5 to row 8): 5-1=4. Row 7 (difference 5 to row 12): 5-2=3. \n\nExample 1: row 2 to row 6 (difference 4). 4-1=3. Output row 6 starts at 3. \n\nRow 6 to row 11 (difference 5): 5-1=4. Output row 11 starts at 4. \n\nRow 11 to row 13 (difference 2): 2-1=1. But output row 13 starts at 2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. Maybe the formula is (difference) -1. For Example 0: difference 5-1=4. Example 1: difference 4-1=3. Row 11 to 13: difference 2-1=1. But in Example 1's row 13, the starting column is 2, not 1. So it's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the row number modulo something. \n\nAt this point, I might need to conclude that the pattern is: for each row with 8s, five rows below, starting at a column one greater than the row's index modulo some value, insert 1s in all subsequent columns. \n\nAlternatively, the 1s are added in rows five below any row with 8s, starting one column to the right of the leftmost 8 in the original row. \n\nFor Example 0:\n\nRow 3 has leftmost 8 at column 3. Five rows below (row 8), start at column 4. \n\nRow 7 has leftmost 8 at column 3. Five rows below (row 12), start at column 4. But in output row 12, it starts at column 3. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the starting column is the leftmost 8's column plus one. \n\nExample 0's row 3: 3+1=4. Correct. \n\nRow 7: 3+1=4. But output row 12 starts at column 3. So no. \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nLet's look at the test input and see if applying any of these patterns would work. \n\nThe test input is:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\nRow 2: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 3: [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\nRow 8: [0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 9: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 10: [0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nApplying the pattern where five rows below a row with 8s, starting one column to the right of the leftmost 8:\n\nFor row 1: leftmost 8 at column 2. Five rows below is row 6. Start at column 3. But row 6 in the test input is all 0s, so output row 6 would have 1s starting at column 3. \n\nRow 2: leftmost 8 at column 0. Five rows below is row 7. Start at column 1. \n\nRow 3: leftmost 8 at column 2. Five rows below is row 8. Start at column 3. \n\nRow 8: leftmost 8 at column 3. Five rows below is row 13. Start at column 4. \n\nRow 9: leftmost 8 at column 0. Five rows below is row 14. Start at column 1. \n\nRow 10: leftmost 8 at column 3. Five rows below is row 15, which is beyond the input's 15 rows. \n\nSo in the output, rows 6,7,8,13,14 would have 1s starting at columns 3,1,3,4,1 respectively. \n\nBut looking at the training examples, the 1s are consecutive. So if row 6 in the test output starts at column 3, then columns 3-9 would be 1s. Similarly for other rows. \n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples? Let's check Example 1:\n\nInput row 6 has 8s at columns 0-2. Five rows below is row 11. Start at column 0+1=1. But in Example 1's output, row 11 starts at column 4. So this doesn't fit. \n\nSo this approach must be wrong. \n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 1s are added in the same row where there's a transition from 8 to 0. For example, if a row has 8s followed by 0s, replace the 0s with 1s. But in Example 0, row 3 has all 8s, so no 0s to replace. \n\nIn Example 1's input row 6, which has 8s followed by 0s, the output replaces the 0s with 1s. That fits. Similarly, in Example 2's input row 6, which has 8,0,8,0,0..., the output replaces some of the 0s with 1s. \n\nBut this doesn't explain the 1s added in rows that were all 0s in the input. So there must be another rule. \n\nThe other rule could be: for every row that has 8s, five rows below, replace 0s with 1s starting from the column after the rightmost 8 of the original row. \n\nFor example, in Example 0's input row 3 (rightmost 8 at column 9), five rows below is row 8. So starting at column 10 (but it's only up to column 9). So no 1s. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, starting from the leftmost 8 column in the original row. \n\nThis is really not working. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe the 1s are a countdown of some sort. For example, each 8 starts a countdown, and after five steps (rows), the 1s start. \n\nIn Example 0's row 3 has 8s. Five rows later, row 8 starts the 1s. Then, once the 1s start, they continue in subsequent rows. \n\nBut in Example 0's output, row 12 also has 1s. Which is five rows after row 7 (which has an 8). \n\nSo perhaps the rule is: for each row containing 8s, five rows below, starting from the same column as the leftmost 8 in the original row, replace 0s with 1s. \n\nFor Example 0:\n\nRow 3 has leftmost 8 at column 3. Five rows below is row 8. So in row 8, starting from column 3, replace 0s with 1s. But in the output, row 8 starts at column 4. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, starting from column 3+1=4. So five rows below, start at column 4. \n\nIn the test input:\n\nRow 1 has leftmost 8 at column 2. Five rows below is row 6. So column 2+1=3. Replace 0s in row 6 from column 3 onward with 1s. \n\nRow 2 has leftmost 8 at column 0. Five rows below is row 7. Column 0+1=1. Replace 0s from column 1. \n\nRow 3 has leftmost 8 at column 2. Five rows below is row 8. Column 2+1=3. Replace 0s from column 3. \n\nRow 8 has leftmost 8 at column 3. Five rows below is row 13. Column 3+1=4. Replace 0s from column 4. \n\nRow 9 has leftmost 8 at column 0. Five rows below is row 14. Column 0+1=1. Replace from column 1. \n\nRow 10 has leftmost 8 at column 3. Five rows below is row 15 (out of range). \n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nRow 6 in output would be [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow 7: [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow 13: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow 14: [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nBut looking at the test input, the original rows 6 and 7 are all zeros. So modifying them as per this rule would add 1s. \n\nBut looking at the training examples, Example 0's output row 8 starts at column 4. Which would match column 3+1. Similarly, Example 0's row 12 (five rows below row 7) starts at column 3+1=4. But in the output, row 12 starts at column 3. So this doesn't fit. \n\nThus, this approach is inconsistent. \n\nAnother possible pattern: For each 8 in the input, five rows below and one column to the right, replace the 0 with 1. \n\nFor example, an 8 at row i, column j becomes a 1 at row i+5, column j+1. \n\nLet's check Example 0:\n\nRow 3, column 3: becomes row 8, column 4. Which is correct. \n\nRow 3, columns 4-9: becomes row 8, columns 5-10. But since columns only go up to 9, 5-9 are set to 1. So row 8 would have 1s from 4 to 9. Which matches. \n\nRow 7, column 3: becomes row 12, column 4. But in the output, row 12 starts at column 3. So this doesn't fit. \n\nSo this is inconsistent. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nThe pattern seems to involve adding 1s in rows five below rows with 8s, starting at a column that's related to the position of the 8s in the original row. \n\nFor the test input, the rows with 8s are:\n\nRow 1: columns 2-9.\n\nRow 2: columns 0-1.\n\nRow 3: columns 2-9.\n\nRow 8: columns 3-4.\n\nRow 9: columns 0-2.\n\nRow 10: columns 3-4.\n\nFive rows below each of these:\n\nRow 1: row 6. Maybe 1s start at column 3.\n\nRow 2: row 7. 1s start at column 1.\n\nRow 3: row 8. 1s start at column 3.\n\nRow 8: row 13. 1s start at column 4.\n\nRow 9: row 14. 1s start at column 1.\n\nRow 10: row 15 (out of range).\n\nSo the test output would have:\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow 7: [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0] (original row 8 has 8s at 3-4, so after adding 1s starting at 3, but the original row 8 has 8s, which may be unchanged. Wait, the output rows are the same as input except for the added 1s. So if row 8 in input is [0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0], then the 8s are retained, and the 0s after the 8s are replaced with 1s starting from column 5. But according to the training examples, when a row has 8s followed by 0s, the 0s become 1s. So in row 8 of the test input, after the 8s at 3-4, the 0s from 5 onward would become 1s. But according to the other pattern of five rows below, maybe row 8's 1s are from the 8s in row 3, which would start at column 3+1=4. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Given the time I have, I'll assume that for each row with 8s, five rows below, starting from the column after the leftmost 8 in the original row, replace 0s with 1s. \n\nSo for row 1 in test input (leftmost 8 at 2), five rows below is row 6, starting at column 3. \n\nRow 2 (leftmost 8 at 0): row 7, column 1. \n\nRow 3 (leftmost 8 at 2): row 8, column 3. \n\nRow 8 (leftmost 8 at 3): row 13, column 4. \n\nRow 9 (leftmost 8 at 0): row 14, column 1. \n\nThus, the output would be:\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow 7: [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0] (original row 8 has 8s at 3-4, but according to training examples, rows with 8s are unchanged. But according to the transformation, five rows below a row with 8s would have 1s. But this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s in the input are retained, and the 1s are added in other rows. \n\nGiven that in the training examples, the output rows with 8s are the same as the input. The 1s are added in other rows. So for the test input:\n\nRows 1,2,3,8,9,10 have 8s and remain unchanged. \n\nThen, five rows below those:\n\nRow 1's 8s would add 1s in row 6, starting at column 3. \n\nRow 2's 8s add 1s in row 7, starting at column 1. \n\nRow 3's 8s add 1s in row 8, starting at column 3. \n\nRow 8's 8s add 1s in row 13, starting at column 4. \n\nRow 9's 8s add 1s in row 14, starting at column 1. \n\nSo the output would modify rows 6,7,8,13,14. \n\nFor example:\n\nRow 6 (originally all 0s) becomes [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nRow 7 (all 0s) becomes [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nRow 8's input is [0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Since it's five rows below row 3, starting at column 3, we replace columns 3 and beyond. But row 8's input has 8s at 3 and 4, so the 0s after them (columns 5-9) would become 1s. So output row 8 would be [0,0,0,8,8,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nSimilarly, row 13 (originally all 0s) would have 1s starting at column 4: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nRow 14 (originally all 0s) would have 1s starting at column 1: [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nThe other rows remain the same.\n\nPutting this all together, the test output would look like:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] (unchanged)\n[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (unchanged)\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] (unchanged)\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (row 6)\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (row 7)\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (row 8)\n[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (unchanged)\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (unchanged)\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (row 13)\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (row 14)\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis seems to fit the pattern observed in the training examples, where 1s are added five rows below rows with 8s, starting one column to the right of the leftmost 8 in the original row.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a grid of numbers (mostly 0s and 8s), and the output modifies some of those to 1s. The challenge is to determine how those 1s are introduced based on the input.\n\nStarting with Example 0: The input has rows with 8s and 0s. The output seems to replace certain 0s with 1s in specific rows. Let me check which rows get modified. For instance, in the input's 8th row (index 8?), the original is all 0s, but the output has 1s starting from position 4. Similarly, row 12 in the output (maybe the 12th row?) also gets 1s. Hmm. Wait, looking at the input, maybe the 1s are added after certain 8s. Let me compare the input and output rows.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the row [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] in row 1 (assuming rows start at 0) stays the same in the output. But then row 8 (input) is all 0s, and in the output, it's [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]. So where do those 1s come from? Maybe it's related to the rows above or below?\n\nWait, looking at the output rows that have 1s: in Example 0, the 8th row in output (if counting from 0) has 1s starting at index 4. Let's see what's above that. The row above (row 7) in the input is [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 8 is at position 3. Then in the output's row 8, the 1s start at position 4. Maybe the 1s are placed to the right of the 8 in the row above?\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the input's 6th row is [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and the output changes that to [8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. So the 0s after the 8s become 1s. Wait, but in that case, the 1s start right after the 8s. So perhaps for any row that has 8s followed by 0s, the output replaces those 0s with 1s starting from the position after the last 8 in the previous row?\n\nWait, no. Let's look again. Example 0's row 3 in input is [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], which in the output remains the same. Then row 8 (input) is all 0s. The output row 8 has 1s starting at index 4. How is that determined? Hmm. Maybe it's looking at the position of 8s in the previous rows. Let's check the structure.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the 1s are added to the rows that are two rows below a row with 8s. Let's see. In Example 0, row 7 in the input is [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Then row 8 in the output has 1s starting at index 4. The 8 in row 7 is at index 3. The 1s start at index 4. So maybe in the output row that's two rows below a row with an 8, starting at the position after the 8's position, replace 0s with 1s.\n\nWait, row 7 (input) has an 8 at index 3. Then row 8 (output) starts 1s at index 4. So 3+1=4. Then, the 1s fill the rest of the row. Similarly, in Example 0's row 12 in the output, the 1s start at index 3. Let's check what's above that. The row above (row 11) in input is [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], so 8 at index 2. Then in output row 12, 1s start at index 3 (2+1). So that seems to fit. So the rule might be: For each row that has an 8, the row two below it (current row +2) will have 1s starting at the position right after the position of the 8. And those 1s continue to the end of the row.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, input row 2 is all 8s. Then output row 4 is all 0s. But the output's row 6 in Example 1 is [8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. The input's row 6 is [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So in the output, the 0s after the 8s are replaced with 1s. But how does that fit with the previous pattern? Wait, maybe there's another rule here. If a row has 8s followed by 0s, then in the output, the 0s after the 8s become 1s. But in other cases, when there's a row with 8s, the row two below gets 1s starting after the 8's position.\n\nWait, maybe two rules are being applied here. Let's check:\n\nRule 1: For each row, if there are consecutive 8s followed by 0s in the same row, replace the 0s with 1s. For example, in Example 1's input row 6: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], the output becomes [8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. So the 0s after the 8s become 1s. Similarly, in Example 0's row 3, there are no 0s after the 8s (they are all 8s), so no change. But in Example 0's row 8, the 1s are added in positions where there were 0s, but not necessarily after 8s in the same row. So perhaps another rule is at play.\n\nRule 2: For each 8 in a row, look two rows below and starting from the next column, replace 0s with 1s. For example, in Example 0, row 7 has an 8 at position 3. Then row 8 (two rows below row 7?) No, row 7 is row index 7, two rows below would be row 9, but in the output, row 8 has the 1s. Wait, maybe it's the next row. Hmm, maybe the row immediately below? Or maybe it's the row two rows below the current row. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, row 7 (index 7) has an 8 at position 3. Then in the output row 8 (index 8), starting at position 4, there are 1s. So the row after (row 8) is modified. That's only one row below. Hmm, maybe the rule is that for each 8 in a row, the next row (i.e., row+1) starting at the next position (column+1) is filled with 1s. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, row 7 has an 8 at column 3. So in row 8 (row+1), starting at column 4 (3+1), fill with 1s. That matches. Similarly, in row 11 of the input (Example 0), there's an 8 at column 2. Then in row 12 (row+1), starting at column 3, fill with 1s. Which matches the output. But in Example 1's row 6 input: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], the output is [8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. So the 0s after the 8s are replaced by 1s. This seems to be a separate rule where in the same row, after the 8s, replace 0s with 1s. So combining these two rules: \n\n1. In any row, if there are 8s followed by 0s, replace the 0s with 1s in the same row.\n2. For each 8 in a cell at position (row, col), in the next row (row+1), starting from col+1, replace 0s with 1s.\n\nWait, but let's check the examples again. \n\nIn Example 0, the input row 7 is [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output row 8 is [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]. So the 8 is in column 3. The next row (row 8) starts at column 4 (3+1) and fills with 1s. That fits. Similarly, in Example 0's input row 11: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], the output row 12 is [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. So 8 is in column 2, next row (row 12) starts at column 3. So that seems consistent.\n\nIn Example 1, input row 2 is all 8s. Then in the output, row 3 is all 0s (no change). But row 6 in the input is [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and the output is [8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. So here, the 0s after the 8s are replaced by 1s. That's rule 1. Also, in the same example, input row 11 is [8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output becomes [8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1], which is rule 1 again. Then, in the output row 13 (input row 13 is [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and output row 13 is [8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. Wait, but according to rule 1, the 0s after the 8s would be replaced. Input row 13 has 8,8 followed by 0s, so output replaces them with 1s. That fits. Additionally, in Example 2, the input row 6 is [8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output row 6 is [8,0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]. Hmm, here, the 1s are placed starting at column 4. Let's check the previous rows. Input row 5 is all 0s, so maybe rule 1 applies here. Wait, input row 6 has 8s at 0,2,4 (assuming it's [8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0] as per the input. Wait, no, looking at Example 2's input:\n\nIn Example 2's input row 6 is [8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 8s are at columns 0 and 2. The output for row 6 is [8,0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]. So after each 8 in the same row, perhaps starting from the next position, 1s are placed every other position. Alternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in the next row. Wait, but in the output row 6, the 1s start at column 4. Let's check the previous row. Row 5 in input is all 0s, so maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the 8s in the same row are influencing the 1s. For example, each 8 in a row causes the positions two columns to the right in the same row to become 1s, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in the same row, two columns after each 8. For example, 8 at column 0: two columns to the right is column 2, but in the output row 6, column 4 has 1. Hmm, maybe this is a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in the same row, starting after the last 8's position. In Example 2's input row 6, the 8s are at 0 and 2, so the last 8 is at position 2. Then starting from position 3, but the output has 1 starting at position 4. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in the next row. Let's look at Example 2's output row 6 and 7. The input row 6 is [8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], output row 6 is [8,0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]. Then input row 7 is [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], output row 7 is [0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1]. So here, each 8 in a row leads to 1s starting from the next column in the next row. For example, in row 6 (output), there's an 8 at column 0. Then in row 7, starting at column 1, there's a 1. Similarly, the 8 in column 2 of row 6 leads to a 1 starting at column 3 in row 7. But in row 7's output, we have 1s starting at column 3. But the output for row 6 has 1s starting at column 4. So maybe there's a combination of the two rules. For example:\n\nRule 1: In the same row, after the last 8, replace 0s with 1s. But only if the 8s are consecutive. If the 8s are not consecutive, maybe this doesn't apply. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in the same row, but two columns after each 8. For example, in Example 2's row 6 input has 8s at 0 and 2. The output has 1s at 4,6,8. Which are two positions after each 8. So 0+4=4? No. 0+2=2, but 2 is already an 8. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe each 8 in a row causes a 1 to appear two positions to the right in the same row. For example, 8 at 0 \u2192 1 at 2. But in the output row 6, 8 is at 0, next is 0, then 8 at 2, next is 0. Then starting at 4, 1s. So perhaps that's not the case. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to outline the possible rules again based on the examples.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- Input rows with 8s followed by 0s in the same row (like row 7: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]) don't have their 0s turned into 1s in the same row. Instead, the next row (row 8) has 1s starting after the position of the 8. So the 8 in row 7, column 3 leads to 1s starting at column 4 in row 8.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\n- Input row 6 has 8s followed by 0s. These 0s are turned into 1s in the same row. Similarly, input row 11's 0s after 8s are turned into 1s. So this seems like a different rule where 0s after 8s in the same row are replaced by 1s. \n\nBut why in Example 0's row 3, which is all 8s, there's no change. Because there are no 0s after. So perhaps rule 1 is: For any row, after the last 8, replace all 0s with 1s. So in Example 1's row 6, after the 8s (positions 0,1,2), the 0s from position 3 onwards become 1s. In Example 0's row 8, the 1s start at position 4. But there are no 8s in row 8. So that must be due to another rule. \n\nSo maybe there are two separate transformations:\n\n1. For each row, if there are 8s followed by 0s, replace those 0s with 1s.\n\n2. For each 8 in a cell (row, col), in the next row (row+1), starting at column col+1, replace all 0s with 1s.\n\nLet's test these two rules against the examples.\n\nExample 0:\n\n- Row 7 has an 8 at column 3. So in row 8, starting at column 4, replace 0s with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\n- Row 11 has an 8 at column 2. So row 12, starting at column 3, replace 0s with 1s. Which matches.\n\nOther rows with 8s followed by 0s:\n\nRow 1 is [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 0s after the 8s are not replaced (output is same as input). So rule 1 doesn't apply here. Hmm, that's confusing. So why in Example 1's row 6, the 0s after the 8s are replaced, but in Example 0's row 1, they are not. What's the difference?\n\nAh, maybe rule 1 only applies to rows that have at least three 8s consecutively. Wait, in Example 1's row 6 input has three 8s followed by 0s. The output replaces the 0s with 1s. But in Example 0's row 1, there are two 8s followed by 0s, and they are not replaced. So maybe the rule is: if a row has three or more consecutive 8s, then the 0s after are replaced with 1s. But in Example 0's row 7, there's a single 8. Then in the output row 8, the 1s are added via rule 2.\n\nBut that doesn't fit with Example 2. In Example 2's input row 6, the 8s are at positions 0 and 2 (non-consecutive), and the output has 1s at positions 4,6,8. So rule 1 wouldn't apply here. Instead, perhaps each 8 in a row affects the next row's positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any 8 in a row leads to 1s in the next row, starting one position to the right, regardless of what's in the same row. And additionally, if a row has consecutive 8s followed by 0s, those 0s are replaced by 1s.\n\nLet me try to apply these rules to Example 0:\n\n- Row 1: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 0s are after two 8s. Since they are consecutive, but there are only two, rule 1 (replace 0s after consecutive 8s) may not apply. So they stay as 0s.\n\n- Row 7: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 8 is in column 3. So rule 2: next row (row 8) starts at column 4, replace 0s with 1s.\n\n- Row 3: all 8s, so no 0s after, so no change.\n\n- Row 6: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Three consecutive 8s. So rule 1 applies: replace 0s with 1s. So output row 6 is [8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. But wait, looking at Example 0's output, row 6 is [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] in the input and [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] in the output. Wait, no! Wait, in Example 0's input row 6 is [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the output row 6 is the same. Wait, no! Wait, looking back:\n\nExample 0's input row 6 is [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and the output row 6 is the same. But according to the output in Example 0's row 6, it's [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So rule 1 doesn't apply here. But in Example 1's row 6, which has three 8s, the 0s are replaced. So this contradicts the previous idea. \n\nThis is getting really confusing. Let's look at the output for Example 0's row 6. The input and output are the same. So why in Example 1's row 6, the 0s are replaced, but not in Example 0's row 6. What's the difference between them?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input row 6: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Output remains the same. But in Example 1's input row 6: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], the output replaces the 0s with 1s. So why the difference? Wait, perhaps there's a different rule here. Let me check the other examples.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the position of the 8s. In Example 0's row 6, the three 8s are at the start, followed by 0s. But the output doesn't change. However, in Example 1's row 6, the same pattern leads to the 0s being replaced with 1s. This suggests that there's another factor at play. Maybe the presence of certain patterns in adjacent rows. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are misrepresented. Let me recheck the training examples.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput row 6: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row 6: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 same as input.\n\nBut in Example 1's input row 6: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], output row 6 is [8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nSo why the difference? What distinguishes these two cases?\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output, there are other rows where 1s are added. For instance, row 8 and row 12. Perhaps the difference is that in Example 0's row 6, the 8s are followed by 0s, but there's a row below (row 7) that has an 8. Whereas in Example 1's row 6, there's no 8 in the row below. \n\nIn Example 0's row 7: [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So maybe when there's an 8 in the next row, the 0s after the 8s in the current row are not converted to 1s. But in Example 1's row 6, the next row (row 7) is all 0s, so the 0s after the 8s are converted to 1s. \n\nThis suggests a rule where if a row has consecutive 8s followed by 0s, and the next row has no 8s, then replace those 0s with 1s. But if the next row has an 8, then the 0s after the 8s in the current row are not replaced. \n\nBut this complicates the pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two rules are:\n\n1. For any row, if there are 8s followed by 0s, replace those 0s with 1s.\n\n2. For any cell with an 8, look at the next row's cell to the right. If it's 0, replace it with 1. But this seems too simple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of the two rules: \n\n- Replace trailing 0s in a row with 1s only if there are no 8s in the rows below that would affect those positions via rule 2.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to approach this step by step.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output rows that have 1s:\n\n- Row 8: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1] \u2192 added 1s starting at position 4.\n\n- Row 12: [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] \u2192 added 1s starting at position 3.\n\nLooking at the input rows above these:\n\n- Row 7 (input): [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 8 is at position 3. So row 8 (output) starts 1s at position 4 (3+1).\n\n- Row 11 (input): [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. 8 at position 2. So row 12 starts 1s at 3.\n\nSo rule 2: For any 8 in row r, column c, in row r+1, starting at column c+1, replace all 0s with 1s.\n\nAdditionally, in Example 1's row 6 input: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], output becomes [8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. Here, the 0s after the 8s are replaced. There's no 8 in row 7 (input row 7 is all 0s). So rule 1 applies: in a row, if there are 8s followed by 0s, replace the 0s with 1s. But why doesn't rule 2 apply here? Because the 8s are in row 6, so rule 2 would affect row 7. But in Example 1's output row 7 is all 0s. So maybe rule 1 and rule 2 are both applied, but rule 1 takes precedence when applicable.\n\nWait, but in Example 1's input row 6, after applying rule 1, the 0s are replaced with 1s. Then, for each 8 in row 6, rule 2 would affect row 7. For example, the 8s in row 6 at columns 0,1,2. So for each of these, in row 7, starting at columns 1,2,3, replace 0s with 1s. But in the output row 7 of Example 1, it's all 0s. So this contradicts the idea. So maybe rule 1 is applied first, and then rule 2. But in this case, why don't the 8s in row 6 affect row 7?\n\nHmm, this is getting really confusing. Let's try to find a different approach. Perhaps the pattern is that for each 8 in a row, the cell two positions to the right and one row below is set to 1. Or some other directional pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output row 6: [8,0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]. The input row 6 is [8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 1s are placed at even indices starting from 4. If we consider each 8 in row 6 (columns 0 and 2), maybe the 1s are placed two columns to the right of each 8. So 8 at column 0 \u2192 1 at column 2. But column 2 in output row 6 is 8. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the 1s are placed two columns to the right of each 8 in the next row. For example, in input row 6, 8 at column 0. Then in row 7, column 0+2=2. But row 7's output is [0,8,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1]. So column 2 is 0. Doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, each 8 in a row causes a 1 to appear in the same row, but one position to the right. So 8 at column 0 \u2192 1 at column 1. But in Example 2's row 6 output, column 1 is 0. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 1s are added in a diagonal pattern. For example, an 8 at (r, c) leads to 1s starting at (r+1, c+1) and continuing to the end. So in Example 0's row 7, column 3 8 \u2192 row 8, columns 4-9 become 1s. In Example 0's row 11, column 2 8 \u2192 row 12, columns 3-9 become 1s. In Example 1's row 6, 8s at columns 0,1,2 \u2192 for each of these, row 7 would have 1s starting at columns 1,2,3. But in Example 1's output row 7 is all 0s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut wait, Example 1's input row 6 is [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], output row 6 is [8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. So here, the 1s are added in the same row, replacing trailing 0s. So rule 1: trailing 0s after 8s in a row become 1s. But only if there are no 8s in the next row that would overlap. Or maybe this is a separate rule.\n\nSo combining both rules:\n\n- For each row, if there are 8s followed by 0s, replace those 0s with 1s.\n\n- For each 8 in row r, column c, in row r+1, starting from column c+1, replace 0s with 1s.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 6, there are 8s followed by 0s. But the output doesn't replace the 0s with 1s. Why? Because in the next row (row 7), there's an 8 at column 3. So the 1s from row 7's 8 would start in row 8. But why doesn't rule 1 apply to row 6? Maybe there's a priority between the rules. For example, rule 2 (adding 1s based on 8s in previous rows) takes precedence over rule 1 (trailing 0s). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rules are applied in a certain order. For example, first apply rule 2 (adding 1s based on 8s in previous rows), then apply rule 1 (trailing 0s). But in Example 0's row 6, applying rule 1 would convert the trailing 0s to 1s. But the output doesn't show that. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the trailing 0s are only replaced if the 8s are in a continuous block. For example, if there's a contiguous block of 8s at the start of the row followed by 0s, then replace the 0s. In Example 0's row 6, the 8s are contiguous (positions 0-2), so the trailing 0s would be replaced. But the output shows they are not. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that trailing 0s are replaced with 1s only if the row is followed by a row that doesn't have any 8s. For example, in Example 1's row 6, the next row (7) has no 8s. So the trailing 0s are replaced. But in Example 0's row 6, the next row (7) has an 8. So the trailing 0s are not replaced. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the trailing 0s are replaced with 1s if there are no 8s in the next two rows. This is getting too arbitrary.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where 1s are added and see if they correlate with 8s in the input.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\n- Row 8: 1s start at column 4. The input row 7 has an 8 at column 3.\n\n- Row 12: 1s start at column 3. Input row 11 has an 8 at column 2.\n\nSo each time, the 1s start at column (c+1) where c is the column of the 8 in the previous row. And they fill the rest of the row.\n\nIn Example 1's output:\n\n- Row 6: 1s start at column 3. Input row 6 has 8s up to column 2.\n\n- Row 11: 1s start at column 4. Input row 11 has 8s up to column 3.\n\nSo in these cases, the 1s start after the last 8 in the same row.\n\nAdditionally, in Example 1's row 13 output: [8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. The input row 13 is [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 0s after the 8s are replaced with 1s.\n\nSo perhaps the rules are:\n\n1. For each row, replace all 0s that come after the last 8 in the row with 1s.\n\n2. For each 8 in row r, column c, in row r+1, replace all 0s from column c+1 onward with 1s.\n\nBut how do these rules interact? For example, if a row has trailing 0s replaced by rule 1, and then rule 2 also affects the same row.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample 0's row 6 input: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Rule 1: replace 0s after last 8 (position 2) with 1s. So output would be [8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. But according to the example, the output is unchanged. So this contradicts. Therefore, rule 1 is not applied here. So there must be another condition.\n\nAh, perhaps rule 1 is only applied if there are no 8s in the next row that would affect the same positions via rule 2. But this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe rule 2 takes precedence over rule 1. For example, if a position is set to 1 by rule 2, then rule 1 doesn't affect it. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are added by both rules, but rule 2 is applied first, and rule 1 is applied afterward, possibly overwriting some positions.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Let's try to focus on the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWe need to apply the pattern observed in the training examples to this input.\n\nLet's first look for any rows that have trailing 0s after 8s. \n\nRow 1: [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. All 8s from column 2 onwards. No trailing 0s. So no change.\n\nRow 2: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Trailing 0s after 8s. So according to rule 1, replace the 0s with 1s. But in Example 0's row 1, which has two 8s followed by 0s, the output didn't replace them. So maybe rule 1 applies only if there are at least three consecutive 8s. But in row 2 of the test input, there are two 8s. So perhaps no change here.\n\nRow 3: All 8s from column 2. No trailing 0s.\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. The 8s are at columns 3 and 4. Trailing 0s. So if rule 1 applies, replace columns 5-9 with 1s. But depends on whether there are three or more consecutive 8s. Here, two 8s. So maybe no.\n\nRow 9: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Three consecutive 8s followed by 0s. So according to Example 1's rule, replace the 0s with 1s. So row 9's output would be [8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nRow 10: [0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Two 8s followed by 0s. So no change via rule 1.\n\nNow applying rule 2: For each 8 in row r, in row r+1, starting at c+1, replace 0s with 1s.\n\nLet's check each row:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. Each 8 is from column 2 to 9. For each of these, row 2 would have 1s starting at column (c+1). For example, the first 8 in row 1, column 2: row 2 starts at column 3. But row 2's input is [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So applying rule 2 for each 8 in row 1:\n\n- For columns 2-9 in row 1, each 8 would affect row 2's columns 3-10 (but row 2's columns are 0-9). So for each 8 in row 1 at column c, row 2's columns c+1 and beyond are set to 1. But row 2's input has 8s in columns 0 and 1. So for example, the 8 in row 1, column 2: in row 2, columns 3-9 should be set to 1. But row 2's input is [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Applying rule 2 would change columns 3-9 to 1. So row 2's output becomes [8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nRow 2's input is [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. After applying rule 2 from row 1's 8s, the output would have 1s from column 3 onward. \n\nThen, for the 8s in row 2 (columns 0 and 1), rule 2 would affect row 3. For each 8 in row 2, column c=0 and 1, row 3's columns 1 and 2 would start 1s. But row 3's input is all 8s from column 2 onward. So changing columns 1 and 2 (if they are 0s). But row 3's input is [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. So columns 0 and 1 are 0, columns 2-9 are 8. So applying rule 2 from row 2's 8s:\n\n- For row 2's column 0 (8), row 3 starts at column 1. Replace 0s from column 1 onward. Row 3's input columns 1 is 0, columns 2-9 are 8. So column 1 becomes 1, columns 2-9 remain 8. So row 3 becomes [0,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\n- For row 2's column 1 (8), row 3 starts at column 2. Since column 2 is already 8, no change. So row 3's output after applying rule 2 would be [0,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nBut in the original input's row 3 is [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. So after applying rule 2 from row 2's 8s, row 3's output would have 1 in column 1.\n\nBut according to the training examples, in such cases where there's an 8 in row r, the row r+1's columns after c+1 are filled with 1s, regardless of existing values. Or maybe existing 8s are left as is, and only 0s are replaced.\n\nSo in row 3's case, after applying rule 2 from row 2's column 0 8, columns 1-9 in row 3 are set to 1 if they are 0. So row 3's input is [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. So columns 0 and 1 are 0. Applying rule 2 from row 2's column 0 8: row 3 starts at column 1. Columns 1 is 0 \u2192 becomes 1. Columns 2-9 are 8 \u2192 no change. So row 3 becomes [0,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nSimilarly, for row 2's column 1 8: row 3 starts at column 2. Column 2 is 8 \u2192 no change. So row 3's output would be [0,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nNow, looking at row 8's input: [0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. The 8s are at columns 3 and 4. Applying rule 2: For each 8 in row 8, column 3 and 4, row 9's columns 4 and 5 would start replacing 0s with 1s.\n\nRow 9's input is [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. After applying rule 1 (three consecutive 8s), the trailing 0s are replaced with 1s. So row 9's output is [8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nThen, applying rule 2 from row 8's 8s:\n\n- For column 3 in row 8: row 9 starts at column 4. The row 9's columns 4 and beyond are already 1s. So no change.\n\n- For column 4 in row 8: row 9 starts at column 5. Columns 5-9 are already 1s. So no change.\n\nNow, row 9's output is [8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. Then, applying rule 2 from row 9's 8s (columns 0,1,2):\n\n- Each 8 in row 9 affects row 10's columns 1,2,3. \n\nRow 10's input is [0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Applying rule 2 from row 9's 8s:\n\n- For column 0 8 in row 9: row 10's columns 1-9 become 1s if 0. So row 10's columns 1 and 2 are 0, so replaced with 1s. Column 3 is 8, so remains. Columns 4 is 8, so remains. Columns 5-9 are 0, replaced with 1s.\n\n- For column 1 8 in row 9: row 10's columns 2-9. Columns 2 is 0 \u2192 1. Columns 3-9: as before.\n\n- For column 2 8 in row 9: row 10's columns 3-9. Column 3 is 8 \u2192 no change. \n\nSo after applying all three 8s in row 9, row 10's output would be:\n\n[0,1,1,8,8,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nWait, but let's step through each 8 in row 9:\n\n- 8 at column 0: row 10 starts at column 1. So columns 1-9 in row 10 are 0s except columns 3 and 4. So replacing 0s with 1s:\n\nRow 10 becomes [0,1,1,8,8,1,1,1,1,1].\n\n- 8 at column 1: starts at column 2. Columns 2-9: column 2 is 0 \u2192 1. Columns 3 and 4 are 8s. Columns 5-9 are 0 \u2192 1. So row 10 becomes [0,1,1,8,8,1,1,1,1,1].\n\n- 8 at column 2: starts at column 3. Column 3 is 8 \u2192 no change. So no effect.\n\nThus, row 10's output is [0,1,1,8,8,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nNow, applying rule 1 to any rows:\n\nRow 9's output is already handled. Row 10 has 8s at columns 3 and 4, followed by 1s. So no trailing 0s. Row 8 has 8s followed by 0s and then 1s. Not sure.\n\nFinally, row 8's output: [0,0,0,8,8,1,1,1,1,1] (assuming row 8's trailing 0s after 8s are replaced by rule 2 from row 7's 8s. But row 7's input is all 0s. So no.\n\nWait, row 7's input is all 0s, so rule 2 doesn't apply. So row 8's input is [0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. Applying rule 2 from row 7's 8s? No, row 7 has no 8s. So no changes from rule 2. But rule 1: row 8's 8s are at 3 and 4, followed by 0s. If there are two 8s, no replacement. So row 8's output remains the same as input.\n\nSo combining all these, the test output would have:\n\nRow 2: [8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nRow 3: [0,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nRow 9: [8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nRow 10: [0,1,1,8,8,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nOther rows remain the same unless affected by other rules.\n\nBut wait, in the test input, row 2's input is [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. After applying rule 2 from row 1's 8s, which are in columns 2-9. So for each 8 in row 1 (columns 2-9), row 2's columns 3-9 would be set to 1. So row 2's output would be [8,8,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. Wait, no. The original row 2 has 8s in columns 0 and 1, and 0s from 2 onwards. Rule 2 says for each 8 in row r, column c, in row r+1, starting at c+1, replace 0s with 1s. \n\nRow 1 has 8s in columns 2-9. For each of these, in row 2, starting at c+1: \n\n- For example, row 1's column 2 8: row 2's columns 3-9 are set to 1.\n\nSimilarly, row 1's column 3 8: row 2's columns 4-9 are set to 1.\n\nBut since all these columns are already being set by the first 8 in column 2, the cumulative effect is that row 2's columns 3-9 are set to 1.\n\nBut row 2's original columns 0 and 1 are 8s. So row 2's output would be [8,8,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nBut according to rule 2, the 0s in row 2's columns 3-9 are replaced with 1s. Yes. So row 2 becomes [8,8,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nThen, in row 3's input, which is [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], after applying rule 2 from row 2's 8s (columns 0 and 1), we have:\n\n- For row 2's column 0 8: row 3 starts at column 1. Columns 1-9 in row 3 are 0,8,8, etc. So column 1 is 0 \u2192 1. Columns 2-9 are 8s. So row 3 becomes [0,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\n- For row 2's column 1 8: row 3 starts at column 2. Columns 2-9 are 8s. No change.\n\nSo row 3's output is [0,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nNow, row 9's output is [8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] due to rule 1 (three consecutive 8s).\n\nRow 10's output is [0,1,1,8,8,1,1,1,1,1] due to rule 2 from row 9's 8s.\n\nAdditionally, row 8's output remains [0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0], but row 9's 8s may affect row 8's output. Wait, no. Rule 2 applies to the next row. So row 9's 8s affect row 10.\n\nPutting it all together, the test output would have the following changes:\n\nRow 2: [8,8,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nRow 3: [0,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nRow 9: [8,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nRow 10: [0,1,1,8,8,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nOther rows remain as per the input unless affected by other rules. For example, row 8 remains the same. But wait, row 8's input is [0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]. After applying rule 2 from row 7's 8s. But row 7's input is all 0s. So no change.\n\nAdditionally, row 9's 8s affect row 10. Which we've covered.\n\nSo the final test output would have these modified rows. Now, formatting this as per the training examples.",
