        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the training examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has multiple rows, and the output seems to change some elements. Let's compare input and output rows. For instance, in the fourth row of the input (index 3 maybe?), the input is [0,4,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output for this row is [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Hmm, so the 4 in position 1 is gone, and the 3 at position 3 is followed by a 3 in position 4. Also, the 4 at position 12 becomes two 4s at positions 11 and 12? Or wait, the input row has 4 at position 12 (since it's the 13th element maybe?), and the output has 4 at position 11 and 12. So maybe some numbers are being shifted or merged?\n\nLooking at another example. In Example 0, the 7th input row (index 7) is [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 4 at position 9 is removed, and the 4s at positions 12 and maybe 11? Wait, input has 4 at position 12 (original 4), and output has 4 at 11 and 12. So perhaps the 4 is moved left and duplicated?\n\nWait, maybe the pattern involves moving certain numbers to adjacent positions when there's a conflict or based on other elements. Let's check Example 1. In the input, the third row is all 2s. The output keeps that row the same. But looking at other rows, like the fifth input row [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0], the output is the same. But in the output, the third row becomes [0,0,0,2,...], which was not present in the input. Maybe there's some kind of gravity effect where numbers fall down or move left/right? Or perhaps certain numbers are merging when adjacent?\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a row with 8s. The output for row 5 (input) is the same, but other rows have 8s moved. For example, the input row 8 has an 8 at position 11, and in the output, row 6 (index 5?) has an 8 in position 3 and 11? Wait, not sure. Maybe numbers are being shifted to the left or right based on some rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each row is processed such that any non-zero numbers are shifted to the left or right, but when there are multiple non-zero numbers, they merge or combine in some way. For example, in Example 0's fourth input row, there's a 3 followed by a 3, which in the output becomes 3,3 in positions 3 and 4. Similarly, the 4s might be merged. Wait, but the output in Example 0's fourth row has 3,3 and 4,4. So maybe when two same numbers are adjacent in the input, they combine into two copies? Or perhaps when a number is followed by another number, they shift to form adjacent pairs. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves looking for certain patterns in the input rows and then replacing them. For instance, in Example 0, rows that have a 3 and then a 4 later might have their 4 shifted left. Let's see. The input rows in Example 0 mostly have a 3 at position 3 (assuming 0-based index) and a 4 at position 12. In the output, some rows have those 4s shifted left by one. For example, the fourth row's 4 moves from position 12 to 11 and 12. Wait, maybe when there's a 3 in the same row, the 4 is moved to the left, creating a duplicate? Or maybe when there's a certain number of elements between them, they are moved closer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that whenever there's a non-zero number, it's moved to the nearest position next to another non-zero number. But that seems vague.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, the third row is all 2s, which remains the same. The fifth input row has a 1 in position 10, which remains. But in the output, some rows have elements shifted. For example, the input row 0 (first row) is [0,0,0,2,0,...], and the output row 2 becomes [0,0,0,2,0,...]. So the 2 is moved down? Or perhaps the rows are being reordered? Wait, in Example 1's input, the third row is all 2s, which in the output remains. But the first input row's 2 is moved to row 2 in the output. So maybe the rows are sorted based on some criteria, like the presence of certain numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each row is adjusted such that certain numbers are moved to specific positions. For example, in Example 0, the 3 and 4 are kept in their original positions except when there's another number in between. Maybe the rule is to collapse or merge numbers when they are separated by zeros. For instance, if a row has a 3 followed by zeros and then a 4, the 4 is moved left to be adjacent to the 3, but only if there's a certain condition met, like another number in the same row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, if there's a number that is higher than others, it's moved to a certain position. Or perhaps it's about the sum of numbers in the row. But looking at Example 0's output, the fourth row in input has sum 3+3+4=10 (maybe), and the output row sum is 3+3+4+4=14. So the sum increases, which suggests that merging or duplicating numbers.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the transformation is that each row is modified by moving all non-zero numbers to the left, filling the gaps with zeros. But in Example 0's fourth row, the input is [0,4,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0], which would become [4,3,3,4, ...] if shifted left, but the output is [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So that doesn't fit. Wait, the output row has 3 at position 3 and 4, and 4s at 11 and 12. The input had 3 at position 3 and 6, and 4 at 12. So maybe when there are two instances of the same number (like two 3s), they are placed next to each other, and similarly for 4s. But how does that happen?\n\nLooking at Example 0's fourth input row, the two 3s are at positions 3 and 6. The output has them at positions 3 and 4. So perhaps the second 3 (at position 6) is moved left to be next to the first 3. Similarly, the 4 at position 12 is duplicated to position 11. So maybe the rule is that whenever there are multiple instances of the same number in a row, they are grouped together and any intermediate zeros are removed, possibly duplicating the numbers? But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero number in a row is shifted to the left as much as possible, but when there are multiple numbers, they are combined by addition. Wait, in Example 0's fourth input row, the numbers are 4, 3, 3, 4. If shifted left and summed, but that doesn't fit. The output has 3,3 and 4,4.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are grouped in pairs. For example, if there's a 3 and another 3 in the row, they are placed next to each other and duplicated. Or perhaps each occurrence of a number is followed by another of the same, but that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input, the fifth row is all 8s, which remains. But in the output's sixth row (index 5?), there are 8s in positions 3 and 11. Wait, the input's eighth row has an 8 at position 11. The output's sixth row (input's row 6?) is [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]. So maybe if there's an 8 elsewhere in the column, it's added here? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves looking at each column and moving numbers down or up. For example, in Example 1, the first input row has a 2 in position 3. In the output, this 2 appears in row 2. So maybe numbers are falling down through empty spaces (zeros) until they hit another number or the bottom. But then, the third row of the output has a 2 in position 3. Wait, but the input's third row is all zeros except for the fourth row which is all 2s. So maybe the 2s from the fourth row (input) are being distributed upwards? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a game of some sort, like Tetris, where numbers fall down and stack. So in Example 0, the 4 in the fourth row's first position (input row 3) is moved down, but in the output, it's not present. Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nWait, let's think of each example's transformation:\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput rows have 3s and 4s. The output rows seem to have 3s and 4s grouped together. For example, the fourth input row had 3 at position 3, then a 3 at position 6. The output row has 3s at positions 3 and 4, and 4s at 11 and 12. So maybe the 3 at position 6 is moved left to position 4, and the 4 at position 12 is moved left to 11 and 12. So perhaps numbers are shifted left, but when there's another number of the same type, they are grouped next to each other, and any existing numbers in between are pushed to the right.\n\nBut how does that explain the duplication of the 4s? Because in the fourth input row, there's a 4 at position 1 (value 4) and a 4 at position 12. The output row has 4s at 11 and 12. So the 4 at position 1 is removed, and the 4 at 12 is duplicated? That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in each row, for each number, if there's a matching number in the same row but separated by zeros, they are moved to be adjacent. For example, two 3s in the same row would be moved to be next to each other, and any 4s would be similarly grouped. But in Example 0's fourth input row, there are two 3s (positions 3 and 6) and one 4 (position 12). The output has two 3s next to each other and two 4s next to each other. So maybe when there are two instances of a number, they are placed adjacent, and if there's only one, it stays. But where does the second 4 come from in the output? The input row has only one 4. Wait, in the fourth input row, the input is [0,4,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So there's a 4 at position 1 and another at 12. The output has 4s at positions 11 and 12. So maybe the two 4s are moved to adjacent positions. But how? The original two 4s are at positions 1 and 12, but in the output, they are at 11 and 12. So perhaps the left 4 is moved right to be next to the right 4. But they are 11 positions apart. That would require moving it 10 positions to the right, which seems unlikely. Unless there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4 at position 1 is removed, and the 4 at 12 is duplicated. But why? Maybe there's a rule that numbers in certain columns are shifted. For example, looking at the test input, which has 2,3,4 in certain positions. The output might need to shift these numbers left or right.\n\nWait, let's look at the test input. Each row starts with [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,...]. The output rows may have these 2s shifted or grouped. For example, in the third row of the test input, there's a 2 at position 4 and another at position 16. The output might group these together. But how?\n\nAlternatively, considering the training examples, perhaps the transformation is that each row is transformed by moving all non-zero numbers to the right, or left, and then merging duplicates. For example, in Example 0's fourth row, moving all non-zero numbers to the left would give [4,3,3,4], but the output has [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4]. So maybe the numbers are moved to the right, but that doesn't fit either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is processed by taking the non-zero numbers and placing them in the same order but spaced such that between each pair, there's one zero. But this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input and output. The input's third row is all 2s, output's third row is same. The input's tenth row is all 1s, output's tenth row is same. So rows that are all the same number remain. For other rows, perhaps non-zero numbers are moved to the bottom of their respective columns. Like in Example 1's input, the first row has a 2 in position 3. In the output, this 2 is moved to row 2 (third row). So maybe numbers fall down to the lowest possible row in their column, stacking on top of existing numbers or the bottom.\n\nBut in Example 0, the fourth input row has a 4 in position 1, which in the output is gone, but there's a 4 in positions 11 and 12. So if numbers fall down, perhaps that 4 is moved down to a lower row. But the output's fourth row has 4s in positions 11 and 12, which would require that in the column, the 4 falls down to that position. However, in the input, there's a 4 in row 3, position 1, and row 3, position 12. If they fall down, but in the output, they are in row 3's positions 11 and 12. So maybe columns are processed such that numbers fall to the bottom of their column, but then how does that explain the duplication?\n\nAlternatively, maybe numbers are shifted to the left in their row, merging with adjacent same numbers. But how does that explain Example 0's fourth row, where two 3s are merged into two 3s adjacent, and two 4s adjacent. Wait, perhaps when two same numbers are separated by zeros, they are merged into one with their sum, but that doesn't match the example. In Example 0's fourth input row, two 3s and two 4s. If summed, the 3s would be 6 and the 4s 8. But the output has 3,3 and 4,4. So that's not summing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are duplicated when there's a certain condition. Like, if a number is preceded by a zero, it's shifted left. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where changes occur in the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 3:\n\nInput: [0,4,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 4 at position 1 is removed, the 3 at position 3 remains, a new 3 is added at position 4, and the 4 at position 12 is duplicated to positions 11 and 12.\n\nSimilarly, in row 7 of Example 0's input:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe 4 at position 9 is removed, and the 4 at 12 is moved to 11 and 12.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each row, any occurrence of a number (like 3 or 4) that is followed by a higher number (like 4) or preceded by certain conditions, the higher number is moved left and duplicated. Alternatively, when there are multiple instances of the same number in a row, they are grouped together, and any other instances are removed.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's row 3, there are two 3s and two 4s. The output groups the two 3s together and the two 4s together. So maybe the rule is to group all instances of the same number together in the row, moving them to the leftmost possible positions, and merging them into pairs. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is transformed by taking the unique numbers in the row and placing them in order, each followed by a zero. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the Test Input. The rows have 2,3,4 in various positions. For example, the first row has 2 at position 4, 3 at 11, and 4 at 20. The output would need to follow the pattern from the training examples. If in the training examples, certain numbers are grouped when possible, perhaps in the test input, these numbers are moved to adjacent positions.\n\nFor example, looking at the third row of the test input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis row has two 2s (positions 4 and 16). Following the pattern from Example 0, perhaps these two 2s are grouped together. So the output row might have 2s at positions 4 and 5, and the 3 and 4 adjusted similarly.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of another way. Maybe the transformation involves taking each number in the row and moving it to a specific column based on its value. For example, 2s go to column 4, 3s to 11, 4s to 20, etc. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers might be shifted to the right or left based on their value. For example, 2s are moved two positions to the left, but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are shifted such that they are placed in the same columns as in the training examples. For instance, in Example 0, 3s are in column 3 and 4s in 11-12. Maybe in the test input, 2s are moved to a certain column, 3s to another, and 4s to another.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each number is moved to a position based on its value multiplied by a certain factor. For example, a 2 would move to position 2*2=4, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are sorted in ascending order from left to right, but duplicates are kept. For example, in Example 0's row 3, the numbers are 4,3,3,4. Sorting them would give 3,3,4,4, which matches the output's 3s and 4s in positions 3,4 and 11,12. But how do they end up in those specific positions?\n\nWait, in Example 0's row 3 input, after removing zeros, the numbers are 4,3,3,4. Sorting them would give 3,3,4,4. So maybe the non-zero numbers are sorted and placed starting from the leftmost position. But in the output, they are placed at positions 3,4,11,12, which are not the leftmost. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nIn the input's third row (all 2s), it remains the same. The tenth row (all 1s) remains the same. So rows with all same numbers are unchanged. Other rows have their elements moved. For example, the fifth input row has a 1 at position 10. In the output, this row is moved to row 9, but the 1 is still at position 10. So maybe rows are reordered based on the presence of certain numbers. For instance, rows with lower numbers are placed higher up. But in Example 1's output, the third row has a 2, which is higher than the 1 in row 9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: In the training examples, the output rows often have non-zero numbers grouped together. For example, in Example 0's output, the 3s and 4s are adjacent. In Example 1's output, the 2s are kept together, and the 1 is isolated. Maybe the rule is to collapse the non-zero numbers in each row into contiguous blocks, filling from the left or right, and duplicates are kept.\n\nSo for each row, take all non-zero numbers and place them contiguously, in their original order, but without any zeros in between. The remaining positions are zeros. For example, in Example 0's input row 3: 4, 3, 3, 4 \u2192 when placed contiguously, it would be 4,3,3,4 followed by zeros. But the output row has 3,3,4,4. So this contradicts. Unless the order is sorted, but as before, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are placed contiguously but in the order they appear in the row, moving them left and removing zeros. So for Example 0's input row 3: the non-zeros are 4,3,3,4. Moving them left would give [4,3,3,4,0,0,...]. But the output is [0,0,0,3,3,0,...]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are shifted to the right, so that they are contiguous at the end. For example, the input row 3's non-zeros would be placed to the right: [0,0,0,3,3,4,4]. But the output is [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4, ...]. So that's not matching either.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the 3s are placed at position 3 and 4, and the 4s at 11 and 12. The input's non-zero numbers in row 3 are at positions 1,3,6,12. So maybe the numbers are moved to certain columns based on their value. For example, 3s go to column 3, 4s to column 11. But why? Or maybe the sum of their positions? Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Each number is moved to a column equal to their value multiplied by some factor. For example, 3 \u2192 3*4=12 (no), 4 \u2192 4*3=12 (maybe). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are shifted to the right until they reach a position that is a multiple of their value. For example, a 3 would move to the nearest multiple of 3. Position 3 is 3 (which is 3*1), position 6 is 3*2, etc. But in Example 0's row 3, the 3s are at positions 3 and 6, which are multiples of 3. In the output, they are at positions 3 and 4, which doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, numbers are shifted to the right by their value. For example, a 3 would shift 3 positions to the right. But in Example 0's row 3, the 3 at position 3 would move to 6, but the output has it at 3. So that's not.\n\nHmm. This is getting frustrating. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the test input rows:\n\nEach row has a 2 at position 4, 3 at 11, and 4 at 20. Except some rows have additional numbers. For example, the third row has another 2 at position 16, the fifth row has an 8 at position 24, etc.\n\nIf the pattern from training examples is to group same numbers together, then in the test input's third row, the two 2s would be grouped. Similarly, any 3s or 4s in the same row would be grouped.\n\nFor example, the third row of the test input is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this row, there are two 2s (positions 4 and 16), a 3 (position 11), and a 4 (20). If the rule is to group same numbers together, the two 2s would be placed next to each other, say at positions 4 and 5. The 3 would stay at 11, and the 4 at 20. But in the output, maybe they are grouped differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number is shifted left as much as possible, and when two same numbers are next to each other, they merge into one with double the value. But in the training examples, the numbers are not summed but duplicated. For example, in Example 0's fourth row, two 3s become two 3s next to each other, not a 6.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are shifted left and duplicates are kept. So the two 2s in the test input's third row would be placed next to each other. So the output row would have 2,2 at positions 4 and 5, and the 3 and 4 in their original positions. But in the training examples, when there's a duplicate, they are placed adjacent. So perhaps the same applies here.\n\nBut how to handle multiple numbers in the row. For example, in the test input's row 15:\n\n[8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nThis row has an 8 at position 0, 2 at 4, 3 at 8 and 11, and 4 at 20 and 24. Following the pattern, the 8 would stay, the 2 at 4, the two 3s would be grouped at 8 and 9, and the two 4s at 20 and 21.\n\nBut I need to see how this aligns with the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0's fourth row, the two 3s are moved from positions 3 and 6 to 3 and 4. The two 4s are moved from positions 1 and 12 to 11 and 12. So perhaps the rule is that same numbers are moved to the earliest possible position, grouped together, and any other numbers are shifted accordingly. For example, in the fourth row of Example 0, the 4 at position 1 is moved to 11 to join the other 4 at 12. But why 11? That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each row is processed by taking the numbers and arranging them in the order of their values, with duplicates placed together. For example, 3s come before 4s. In Example 0's fourth row, the numbers are 4,3,3,4. Arranged as 3,3,4,4. So that's what the output has. So maybe the numbers are sorted in ascending order and grouped together, with their original duplicates.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each row, collect all non-zero numbers, sort them in ascending order, group duplicates together, and place them starting from the left, filling the rest with zeros. So for Example 0's fourth input row, sorted numbers are 3,3,4,4 \u2192 placed starting at position 3 (assuming they start at the original leftmost position of the first occurrence). Wait, the original leftmost 3 is at position 3, and the sorted group starts there. But in the output, the sorted numbers start at position 3 and 4, and then 11 and 12. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are sorted and grouped, and placed starting from the leftmost possible position. So for Example 0's fourth row, after sorting and grouping, the 3s and 4s would be at the start. But the output has them starting at position 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the original positions of the numbers are preserved for the first occurrence, and subsequent duplicates are placed next to them. For example, the first 3 in the row is at position 3, so any other 3s are placed next to it. Similarly for 4s. So in Example 0's fourth row, the first 3 is at 3, so the second 3 is placed at 4. The first 4 is at position 12, so the second 4 is placed at 11 (to the left). Wait, but why left? Because maybe they are grouped to the left of the existing one. But why not to the right?\n\nAlternatively, the duplicates are placed to the right of the first occurrence. So two 3s would be at 3 and 4. Two 4s would be at 12 and 13. But in the output, the 4s are at 11 and 12. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's think of another approach. Perhaps the numbers are being moved to specific columns based on their value. For example, 3s go to column 3, 4s to column 4, but that's not the case. Or maybe the column is determined by the value multiplied by some factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are moved to the right by their value. For example, a 3 is moved right by 3 positions. But in Example 0's fourth row, the 3 at position 3 would move to 6, but the output has it at 3. So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each number is replaced by its value in the corresponding row. For example, in Example 0's output, the fourth row has 3s and 4s. The input row has two 3s and two 4s. The output has two 3s and two 4s. So perhaps each number is duplicated when certain conditions are met. But I can't see the condition.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows have the same numbers as the input rows, but their positions are adjusted such that each number is followed by a copy of itself if there's another instance later in the row. For example, if a row has a 3 followed by zeros and another 3, the second 3 is moved next to the first. Similarly for 4s. This would group the duplicates together.\n\nIn Example 0's fourth input row, the two 3s are at positions 3 and 6. The output moves the second 3 to position 4. The two 4s are at positions 1 and 12; the output moves them to 11 and 12. So perhaps each duplicate is moved to be adjacent to the first occurrence. So for each number in the row, after the first occurrence, any subsequent instances are moved next to it. But how does that work with multiple numbers?\n\nFor example, in the test input's third row, there are two 2s. The first is at position 4, the second at 16. Following this rule, the second 2 would be moved to position 5. The 3 is at 11, so stays. The 4 is at 20. So the output row would have 2,2 at 4 and 5, 3 at 11, and 4 at 20. \n\nBut in Example 0's fourth row, the 4s are moved from 1 and 12 to 11 and 12. So the first 4 at 1 is moved to 11, and the second at 12 stays. But why would the first 4 move to 11? That's unclear.\n\nPerhaps the rule is that for each number in the row, they are moved to the rightmost possible position, grouping duplicates. So the largest number is placed as far right as possible. For example, 4 is larger than 3, so 4s are placed to the right of 3s. So in Example 0's fourth row, the 3s are grouped at 3 and 4, and the 4s at 11 and 12. This way, the 4s are to the right of the 3s. \n\nIn the test input's third row, the 2s are grouped first, then the 3, then the 4. So they would be placed left to right in order of their value. But 2 < 3 < 4, so 2s first, then 3, then 4. So the output row would have the 2s grouped at positions 4 and 5, the 3 at 11, and the 4 at 20. But how does this explain the movement in Example 0's fourth row where the 4s are at 11 and 12, which is after the 3s.\n\nThis seems plausible. So the rule could be:\n\n1. In each row, collect all non-zero numbers.\n2. Sort them in ascending order.\n3. Group duplicates together.\n4. Place them in the row starting from the leftmost position, with each group of the same number placed consecutively.\n\nBut in Example 0's fourth row, the numbers are 4,3,3,4. Sorting gives 3,3,4,4. So they would be placed at the start of the row. However, the output row has them starting at position 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are placed in the same order as they appear in the row, but duplicates are moved to be adjacent. For example, the first occurrence of a number is kept in place, and any subsequent occurrences are moved next to it. This would explain Example 0's fourth row: the first 3 is at position 3, so the next 3 at position 6 is moved to 4. The first 4 is at position 1, but there's another at 12. So the first 4 is moved to 11, and the second to 12. But why would the first 4 move from 1 to 11?\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Let's try to see if there's a simpler pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows, each has 2,3,4 in positions 4,11,20. Maybe in the output, these are moved to positions 4,5 for the 2s, 10,11 for the 3s, and 19,20 for the 4s. For example, each number is duplicated next to its original position. But how does that align with the training examples?\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 3s are at 3 and 4, and 4s at 11 and 12. So the original position of the 3 is 3, and it's duplicated to 4. The 4 is at 12, duplicated to 11. So perhaps each number is duplicated to the position before or after, depending on certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, each number is shifted left by one and duplicated. So a 3 at position 3 would also be at 2. But in Example 0's output, it's at 3 and 4. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are duplicated to the right if possible. So 3 at position 3 would have a duplicate at 4. 4 at 12 would have a duplicate at 13. But in Example 0's output, the 4 is duplicated at 11 and 12. So maybe shifted left.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think of the test input and what the output might look like based on the examples.\n\nIn the test input's rows, the 2s are at position 4. In the output, maybe they are duplicated to position 5. The 3s at position 11 are duplicated to 10 or 12. The 4s at 20 are duplicated to 19 or 21. For example, in the first row of the test input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe output might have 2 at 4 and 5, 3 at 10 and 11, and 4 at 19 and 20. But how to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each number in a row, if there's a higher number to the right, the lower number is shifted left to group with its duplicates. For example, in Example 0's row 3, the 4 at position 1 is lower than the 3 at position 3? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's consider that the output for each row in the training examples has the same length as the input. The transformation is row-wise. \n\nIn Example 0, the fourth row's output is [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,...]. The input has two 3s and two 4s. The output places them in pairs, separated by zeros. Maybe the rule is to pair each number with itself if possible, and place them at specific positions.\n\nFor instance, each number is represented by two consecutive instances, and any remaining are placed elsewhere. But Example 0's row 7 has a single 4 moved to two 4s. So maybe whenever a number appears once, it's duplicated if possible.\n\nBut how to determine where to place the duplicates. In Example 0's row 3, the two 3s are placed at 3 and 4, and the two 4s at 11 and 12. The distance between the 3s and 4s is 7 positions. Maybe the numbers are spaced out in a particular way.\n\nAlternatively, the positions where the numbers are placed are determined by their value multiplied by a certain factor. For example, 3*4=12, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The sum of the numbers in each row of the input equals the sum in the output. For Example 0's fourth row: input sum is 4+3+3+4=14, output sum is 3+3+4+4=14. So the sum is preserved. This suggests that numbers are being rearranged but not summed. So the transformation is rearranging the numbers within the row to group duplicates together, preserving their count.\n\nThus, the rule could be: For each row, collect all non-zero numbers, group them by their value, and place each group consecutively in the row, maintaining the order of their first occurrence. The remaining positions are filled with zeros.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's fourth input row, the numbers are 4,3,3,4 (order of first occurrence: 4, then 3). Grouped as 3,3,4,4. Then placed in the row starting from the leftmost possible position. But the output starts them at position 3. Why?\n\nWait, maybe the groups are placed in the row starting from the position of their first occurrence. For example, the first 3 in the row is at position 3, so the group of 3s starts there. The first 4 is at position 1, but in the output, the 4s are at 11 and 12. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the groups are placed starting from the position corresponding to their value. For example, 3s start at position 3, 4s at position 4. But that doesn't match the output.\n\nThis is really tough. Given the time I've spent and not being able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input, the rows have 2,3,4 in various positions. The training examples suggest that when there are multiple instances of the same number in a row, they are grouped together. So in the test input rows with two 2s (like row 2), the output would group them. Similarly, any 3s or 4s that are duplicated would be grouped.\n\nFor example, row 15 of the test input has 2,3,3,4,4. The output would group the 2s, 3s, and 4s. So the 2 stays at position 4, the two 3s are grouped at 8 and 9, and the two 4s at 20 and 21. But how to know for sure.\n\nAlternatively, each number is shifted to the right by one if there's a duplicate. For example, a 3 at position 11 would stay, and any other 3s would be moved to the next position. So in the test input's row 9, which has a 3 at position 13, the output might move it to 12. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the following approach: For each row in the test input, group the numbers in the order of their first occurrence, placing consecutive duplicates next to each other, and moving other numbers to the right. Any zeros are filled in the remaining positions. So for example, in the test input's third row, the two 2s are grouped at position 4 and 5, the 3 at 11, and the 4 at 20. But according to the training examples, this might not be correct. Alternatively, the numbers are grouped in the order of their values, with lower values first.\n\nBased on Example 0 and 2, where higher numbers are to the right, I'll assume that numbers are grouped in ascending order. So 2s first, then 3s, then 4s, then 8s. Each group is placed consecutively, starting from the left. Any remaining positions are zeros.\n\nSo for the test input's first row:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe grouped numbers would be 2,3,4. So placed consecutively starting at position 4: 2,3,4. But according to Example 0, numbers are grouped with their duplicates. Since there's only one 2, 3, and 4, they would remain in their original positions. But in Example 0's row where there's a single 3 and 4, they remained in their original positions. So maybe only duplicates are grouped.\n\nThus, in the test input's rows where there are no duplicates (like the first row), the numbers remain in their original positions. For rows with duplicates (like the third row), the duplicates are grouped.\n\nSo applying this:\n\nIn the third row of the test input, which has two 2s, the first 2 is at position 4, the second at 16. The output would have both 2s at positions 4 and 5. The 3 and 4 remain in their original positions (11 and 20).\n\nBut how does this align with Example 0's fourth row, where the two 3s are moved from positions 3 and 6 to 3 and 4.\n\nYes, so grouping duplicates by moving them to the earliest possible position after the first occurrence. So the first occurrence stays, and subsequent occurrences are moved next to it.\n\nThus, the rule is:\n\nFor each row, for each number, if there are multiple instances, they are moved to be consecutive, starting at the position of the first occurrence. Other numbers are shifted to the right to make space.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFor example, in row 3 of the test input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe first 2 is at 4, the second at 16. The second 2 is moved to position 5. The 3 at 11 is moved to 6 (since the 2s now occupy 4 and 5). The 4 at 20 is moved to 7. But this doesn't align with the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, other numbers are not shifted, but the duplicates are moved next to the first occurrence. So the second 2 is moved to position 5, and the 3 and 4 remain in their positions. But this would require shifting elements to the right.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that duplicates are grouped next to the first occurrence, and other numbers remain in their positions. For the test input's third row, the two 2s would be at 4 and 5. The 3 and 4 remain at 11 and 20. Zeros are in between.\n\nSo the output row would look like:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSimilarly, any other rows with duplicates would have their duplicates grouped.\n\nApplying this to all rows of the test input, this would be the pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by looking at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has multiple rows, each being a list of numbers. The output seems to modify some of these rows. Let's compare a row that changes. For instance, the fourth input row in Example 0 is [0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the output row becomes [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Hmm, so the 4 in position 1 and the 3 in position 6 are removed, and 3 and 4 are added in positions 4 and 12 (or adjacent to existing numbers?). Maybe there's a shift happening when certain numbers are present.\n\nAnother example row in Example 0: the input row [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So the 2 in position 7 is removed. But how does that relate to the output? Maybe certain numbers are being moved or consolidated.\n\nLooking at Example 1: the input has a row [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0] which in the output becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So the 4 is removed. But then in another row, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], so the 2 is removed. Wait, but in the output, there's a row [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] which might come from another input row. Hmm, perhaps the pattern is that certain numbers are being moved to adjacent positions based on some rule, or maybe duplicates are merged?\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a row [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the output row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The 1 and 8 are removed. Then there's a row [8, 8, 8, 8, ...] which remains the same. Another row in input [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] in the output. Wait, no. Wait in Example 2's output, the fifth input row (index 4) [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Wait, no. Let me check again. The input rows in Example 2: the fifth row is all 8s. The output row 4 (index 4) becomes [0,0,...,8,...]. So maybe numbers are being shifted downward? Like, if there's a number in a row, it moves down unless blocked. Like in a falling block game. For example, in the input, if there's a number in a row, in the output, it might move down to the next row unless there's something blocking it. But how does that explain the changes?\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, some rows have a 3 followed by a 4. In the output, sometimes those numbers are moved to adjacent positions. Like the input row with 4 and 3 becomes a row with 3 and 4 shifted to the right or left? Maybe numbers are being consolidated when they are adjacent. For instance, if there's a 3 and later a 4, maybe they merge. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row, certain numbers are moved to specific positions. For example, numbers might be aligned to the left or right, but that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input has a row with [2,2,...,2] which stays the same. Another row [0,0,0,2,0,...] in input becomes [0,0,0,0,...] in output. Wait, no. Wait in Example 1's input, the first row is [0,0,0,2,0,...], and the output's third row is [0,0,0,2,0,...]. Maybe the 2 is moved down. Like, the 2 in row 0 (input) is moved down to row 2 in the output. Similarly, the row with 4 in the input (row 1) is removed in the output. So maybe when a number is alone in a row, it falls down until it hits another number or the bottom.\n\nSo the rule could be: numbers (non-zero) fall down as far as possible. If there's a non-zero in a row, it moves down to the next row if that position is empty. Repeat until it can't move anymore. Then, when applying this to each row, the non-zero numbers \"fall\" down through the empty spaces (zeros) below them.\n\nWait, but how does this explain the changes in the examples?\n\nTake Example 0's fourth input row: [0,4,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output for this row is [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 4s in positions 1 and 12 are moved to positions 4 and 12, but merged? Wait, original has 3, 3, and 4. The output has 3,3 followed by 4,4. Hmm, maybe adjacent numbers of the same value are merged. But in the input, there are two 3s in positions 3 and 6, and two 4s in positions 1 and 12. But in the output, they are placed next to each other. Wait, maybe numbers are shifted left and merged if they are the same and adjacent. But that would be similar to the game 2048.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being shifted to the left, combining when possible. But how does that fit with the rows in the examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each row is processed to move non-zero elements to the left, filling the zeros on the right. But looking at Example 0's input row [0,4,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0], moving non-zeros left would give [4,3,3,4,0,...], but the output is [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,...]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are being moved to the right. Let's see: the input row in Example 0, fourth input row, has 4 at index 1, 3 at index 3, 3 at index 6, and 4 at index 12. In the output row, the 3s are at indices 3 and 4, and the 4s at 11 and 12. So maybe they are shifted to the right and combined. So the original 3 at index 3 and 6 are shifted right, but how? Maybe each number is shifted as far right as possible, but combining same numbers when adjacent. For example, the two 3s might merge into a 3 and 3 next to each other. Wait, but in the output row, there's 3,3 in positions 3 and 4. So maybe they are grouped together. Similarly, the 4s in positions 1 and 12 in the input are moved to positions 11 and 12 (since 1+10=11?), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that in each row, non-zero numbers are shifted to the left, but with certain conditions. For example, if there's a non-zero number followed by a zero, it moves left. But in Example 0's fourth input row, moving all non-zeros to the left would compact them, but the output has them spread out. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input. The input row [2,2,2...] remains the same. The row [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] in input becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] in output. But in the output, there's a row that has a 2 in position 3. Maybe the 2s are moved down. Like, if a row has a non-zero, it's moved down to the next row if possible. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each non-zero number in a row is moved to the row below it, if that position in the row below is zero. But that would require looking at the entire grid. However, in the training examples, each row's output seems to depend only on its own input, not other rows. Because in Example 0's input, there are multiple identical rows, and their outputs are the same as the input except when modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in each row, any non-zero element that is not part of a consecutive sequence of the same number is removed. But that seems unclear.\n\nWait, in Example 0's fourth input row, the 4 and the 3 and another 3 and 4. The output has two 3s and two 4s. Maybe adjacent duplicates are merged. But in the input, the 3s are at positions 3 and 6. In the output, they're at 3 and 4. So perhaps they are shifted to be next to each other and merged. But the output shows 3 and 3, not merged into a higher number. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being sorted in some way. For example, in the fourth input row of Example 0, the numbers 4,3,3,4. If sorted in ascending order, they would be 3,3,4,4. But how does that fit the positions? The output row has 3s at positions 3 and 4, and 4s at positions 11 and 12. So maybe the numbers are grouped and sorted, but how the positions are determined isn't clear.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input row with 8 in position 7 (index 7) in the second row becomes a row in the output where the 8 is moved down. The output's fifth row (index 4) has an 8 in position 7, which might correspond to the input's second row's 8 moving down to row 4. But how does that happen across rows? Maybe numbers fall down until they hit the bottom or another number. So if a number is in a row, it moves down as far as possible.\n\nSo the pattern could be similar to the game Tetris, where blocks fall down until they land on something. But each row is processed individually? Or perhaps for each column, the numbers fall down, stacking on top of each other.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input has a row with a single 8 in position 7 (second row), and in the output, that 8 is in row 4, position 7. So it moved down three rows. That suggests that the 8 fell down through the empty rows below it. So the transformation is that in each column, the numbers fall to the bottom, stacking up. So in the test input, each column's numbers would move down to the lowest possible position, filling from the bottom up.\n\nBut how does that explain Example 0? Let's check. In Example 0's input, the fourth row has 4,3,3,4. If we process columns, for each column, the numbers would fall down. But in the output, the fourth row's 3 and 4 are moved. Hmm, perhaps not columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is processed such that all non-zero numbers are shifted to the right or left, combining same numbers when adjacent. For example, in the fourth input row of Example 0: [0,4,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. If we shift all non-zeros to the left, but merge consecutive same numbers by summing them. Wait, but the output for that row is [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,...]. So the two 3s become two 3s next to each other, and the two 4s become two 4s next to each other. So maybe the non-zero numbers are grouped together but not summed. Instead, they are shifted to the left, but in this case, the 4s are moved to the right. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are shifted to the right. Let's see. The input row is [0,4,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0...]. Shifting non-zeros to the right would result in [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,3,4,0...]. But the output has [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0...]. So that doesn't align.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers are sorted in the row, with zeros moved to the left. But the 3s and 4s would be grouped. For example, the input row after sorting non-zeros in ascending order: [3,3,4,4], but the output has them at positions 3,4,11,12. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, any non-zero element that is not part of a horizontal pair (two same numbers adjacent) is removed, and the pairs are kept. But in Example 0's fourth input row, there are two 3s and two 4s, but not adjacent. The output combines them into adjacent pairs. So maybe the numbers are shifted to form adjacent pairs if possible.\n\nBut how exactly? Like, the 3s in positions 3 and 6 in the input row would shift to positions 3 and 4 in the output. The 4s in positions 1 and 12 would shift to 11 and 12. So maybe each number is shifted left or right to form pairs.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are shifted towards the center. But that's a bit vague.\n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output for each example and look for common transformations.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the fourth row has 4,3,3,4. The output has 3,3 and 4,4. So perhaps the numbers are arranged into pairs of the same value. The 4s and 3s are moved into adjacent positions. So the rule might be that in each row, the numbers are grouped into pairs of the same value, placed adjacent to each other, and any singletons are removed. But how?\n\nWait, but in Example 0's output, the fourth row has two 3s and two 4s. The input row had those numbers but not adjacent. So the transformation could involve moving the numbers to form pairs. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are arranged such that each number must have a neighbor of the same value, otherwise it's removed. So in the input row, if a number is alone (no same number adjacent), it's removed. But then how are the pairs formed in the output? For example, the input row in Example 0's fourth row has two 3s and two 4s, but not adjacent. The output pairs them. So perhaps the rule is that non-paired numbers are moved to form pairs, possibly in the same row.\n\nBut this is getting a bit unclear. Let's look at another example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input row [0,0,0,2,0,...] in the first row becomes [0,0,0,0,0,...] in the output. But there's another input row [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] which becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 2 is removed. But in the output's third row, there's a 2 in position 3, which comes from another input row. Maybe the 2 in the first input row is moved down to the third row.\n\nSo perhaps the numbers are falling down through empty rows until they hit a non-zero cell or the bottom. So each column is processed such that numbers fall down, stacking on top of existing numbers or the bottom.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each column, all the numbers are shifted to the bottom, filling the lower rows first, and zeros are on top.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, each row has a 3 and a 4 in certain positions. For instance, the first row is [0,0,0,3,0,...,4,0,...]. If we process each column, the 3 in column 3 of the first row would fall down through all the rows below. But the output rows still have 3 and 4 in the same columns. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in Example 1's input, the first row has a 2 in column 3. If this 2 falls down through the rows, it would land in the third row's column 3, which matches the output. Yes! The output's third row in Example 1 is [0,0,0,2,0,...], which might be where the 2 from the first row landed. Similarly, the input's second row has a 4 in column 9, which is removed in the output, implying it fell further down. But where is it in the output? Looking at the output rows, in row 4 (index 4) of Example 1's output, there's a 2 in column 10. Hmm, maybe the 4 from row 1, column 9 fell down to row 4, column 10? That doesn't make sense. Or perhaps it's a different number.\n\nThis approach might be getting too complicated. Let's think of another angle.\n\nLooking at the test input provided. The test input has multiple rows with 2,3,4,8 in various positions. If the pattern is similar to the training examples, the output would modify some rows by moving certain numbers.\n\nFor example, looking at the third test input row: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]. The output might merge the two 2s into a pair or shift them. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that in each row, any number that is not part of a pair (two consecutive same numbers) is removed, and pairs are kept. But looking at Example 0's fourth row, which has two 3s and two 4s but not adjacent, and the output pairs them. So maybe the rule is to shift numbers to form pairs, and remove any that can't be paired.\n\nBut how to handle numbers that can't form pairs. For example, in the test input's fifth row, there's an 8 in position 9. If that's a singleton, it would be removed. But in Example 2, the row with a single 8 in input becomes 0s in the output. So maybe singleton numbers are removed, and pairs are formed by shifting.\n\nBut how exactly the shifting works isn't clear. Let's think about the test input's rows. For example, row 15 in the test input: [8,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,0]. The output might have the 8 removed, the 2 in position 4 stays, the 3s in positions 8 and 11 become 3s paired, the 4s in positions 20 and 24 become paired. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are being moved to the nearest position where they can form a pair. For example, if a number is alone, it moves left or right to find a matching number. But this is speculative.\n\nAnother approach: in Example 0, the output rows seem to have the 3 and 4 moved to positions next to each other. For example, the fourth input row's 3s and 4s are now grouped as 3,3 and 4,4 in the output. So perhaps the rule is that for each number in a row, if there's another instance of the same number in the row, they are moved to adjacent positions, and any singleton numbers are removed.\n\nBut how does that explain the movement? For example, in the fourth input row of Example 0, the two 3s are at positions 3 and 6. In the output, they are at 3 and 4. So they move left to form a pair. The 4s are at positions 1 and 12, moving to 11 and 12. So perhaps numbers are shifted to the right to form pairs, but why?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are grouped and centered. For example, the two 3s are centered around their original positions. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that each row is replaced with a version where all occurrences of the same number are grouped together in the order they appear, but only pairs are kept. So in the input row with two 3s and two 4s, they are grouped as 3,3 and 4,4. But how the positions are determined.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation involves moving each number to the leftmost possible position, merging with the same number if adjacent. So in Example 0's fourth row, the 4 at position 1 would move left to position 0, but there's a zero there. But in the output, it's removed. Hmm, not sure.\n\nThis is getting quite complicated. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLet's consider that in each example, the output rows have the same numbers as the input rows but rearranged. For instance, in Example 0's fourth input row, the numbers 4,3,3,4 become 3,3,4,4 in the output. So the order of the numbers is preserved but grouped by value. So perhaps the rule is to sort the numbers in each row in ascending order, but zeros are kept. But in the fourth input row, the numbers would be sorted as 3,3,4,4, but the positions are spread out. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are grouped by value but their order is preserved. So the first occurrence of each number is kept, and others are moved to be adjacent. But again, the exact movement isn't clear.\n\nAnother possible pattern is that the output is the input but with certain numbers moved to their corresponding positions in a specific pattern. For example, in Example 0, the 3s and 4s are placed at certain fixed positions, and other numbers are removed. But this seems too arbitrary.\n\nWait, looking at the test input, each row has a 2, 3, 4, and sometimes an 8. For example, the first test input row is [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]. If the pattern is to shift each number to a specific position in the row. For example, 2 is always in position 4, 3 in 11, 4 in 20, and 8 in 24. Looking at the test input rows:\n\n- The 2 is in position 4 in all rows.\n- The 3 is in position 11 in all rows except row 9 (position 13).\n- The 4 is in position 20 in all rows.\n- The 8 appears in position 24 (row 4), position 9 (row 5), position 17 (row 11), position 25 (row 15), and position 22 (row 17).\n\nIn the training examples, like Example 0, the 3 is in position 3 and 4 in position 12. So maybe each number has a designated column. For example, 3s are moved to column 3 and 4s to column 12, as in Example 0's output. Similarly, in Example 1, 2s are in column 3 of the third row. So perhaps each number type is moved to a specific column, and others are removed.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output rows: most rows have 3 in position 3 and 4 in position 12. The fourth row has 3 in positions 3 and 4, and 4 in 11 and 12. The eighth row has 4 in position 11 and 12. So maybe when there are multiple instances of a number, they are placed in consecutive positions starting from their designated column.\n\nFor example, 3's designated column is 3, and 4's is 12. If there are two 3s, they occupy 3 and 4. Two 4s: 11 and 12. So it's like aligning numbers to their designated columns and placing multiple instances consecutively.\n\nIn Example 0's fourth input row, there are two 3s and two 4s. In the output, they are placed in columns 3-4 and 11-12. So this would fit. Similarly, in Example 1's input, the third row of the output has a 2 in column 3. The fourth row of the output has a 2 in column 6. But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, each number has a base column, and when multiple instances are present, they are placed starting from the base column, possibly overlapping.\n\nThis seems possible. For example, 3's base column is 3, so any 3s are placed starting from there. 4's base is 12. Similarly, 2's base could be column 3 (in Example 1's output), 8's base could be column 7 (as in Example 2's output row 4, which has 8 in column 7).\n\nIn the test input, the 2 is always in column 4. If the base column for 2 is 4, then in the output, they would stay there. But why in Example 1's output, the 2 is in column 3. Maybe the base column depends on the number. Like, number 2's base is column 3, 3's is 3, 4's is 12, 8's is 7, etc.\n\nBut in the test input, there's a 8 in column 24 (row 4) and 9 (row5), which would need to be moved to column 7, but in Example 2's output, 8 is in column 7. So perhaps all 8s are moved to column 7.\n\nBut how to determine the base column for each number? Looking at the training examples:\n\n- In Example 0: 3 is in column 3, 4 in 12.\n- In Example 1: 2 is in column 3 of the third row.\n- In Example 2: 8 is in column 7.\n\nSo perhaps the base column for a number is the number itself modulo the row length, or something like that. For example:\n\n- For number 3: base column 3.\n- For number 4: base column 12 (but how? 4 mod something?)\n- For number 8: column 7 (maybe 8-1=7? Not sure).\n\nAlternatively, the base column is the number's value minus 1. So 2 -> 1, 3->2, 4->3, etc. But Example 0's 3 is in column 3, which would be 3, not 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the base column is determined by the number's own value. For example:\n\n- 2: column 3 (2 +1=3)\n- 3: column 3 (3)\n- 4: column 4 (4)\n- 8: column 8-1=7.\n\nBut Example 0's 4 is in column 12, which doesn't fit. So this seems unlikely.\n\nAnother angle: in Example 0, the input rows have 3 and 4 in columns 3 and 12. The output rows also have them there, except when there are multiple instances, in which case they are placed consecutively starting from their base column. So for example, two 3s would be in columns 3 and 4, two 4s in 12 and 13. But in Example 0's output fourth row, the 4s are in columns 11 and 12. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the base column for 4 is 11, so two 4s are placed in 11 and 12. But why?\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in the training examples, the output rows have the same numbers as the input but rearranged such that numbers of the same value are grouped together, and other numbers are removed. For example, in Example 0, the fourth input row has 4,3,3,4, and the output has 3,3,4,4. The other numbers (like the 4 in position 1) are removed. So perhaps the rule is that each row is modified to contain only pairs of numbers, placed consecutively, and any singletons are removed.\n\nBut how are the pairs positioned? In the output, they're placed in specific columns. Maybe the first occurrence of a number in the row determines where its pairs are placed.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are moved to their original positions but only if they can form pairs. For example, in the input row of Example 0's fourth row, the 3s and 4s are moved to their original columns but adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are shifted left until they meet another number of the same value. So in the input row, the 4 at position 1 moves right until it meets another 4 at position 12, but they are not adjacent. So this doesn't fit.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that each row is transformed by taking all the non-zero numbers, arranging them in groups of two of the same value, and placing them in specific columns based on their value, removing any odd occurrences.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's fourth input row, there are two 3s and two 4s. The output places the two 3s in columns 3 and 4, and the two 4s in 11 and 12. So each pair is placed in consecutive columns starting at their base column (3 for 3, 11 for 4). The base columns seem arbitrary, but maybe derived from the training examples.\n\nFor instance, in Example 0, 3s are always in column 3, and 4s in column 12. So their pairs start at column 3 and 12 respectively.\n\nIn Example 1, the third output row has a 2 in column 3. The fourth output row has a 2 in column 6. But there's a row with all 2s which remains. So perhaps for a single 2, it's placed in column 3, but for multiples, they are spread out.\n\nThis line of thinking is getting too speculative. Maybe the correct approach is to recognize that in each row, numbers are moved to specific columns based on their value. For example:\n\n- Value 3 \u2192 column 3\n- Value 4 \u2192 column 12\n- Value 2 \u2192 column 3\n- Value 8 \u2192 column 7\n\nThen, when multiple instances of a number exist, they are placed in consecutive columns starting from their base column.\n\nSo for example, two 3s would be in columns 3 and 4. Two 4s in 12 and 13. Three 3s would be in 3,4,5, etc.\n\nApplying this to Example 0's fourth input row, which has two 3s and two 4s, they are placed in 3-4 and 12-13. But in the output, they are in 3-4 and 11-12. Hmm, so maybe the base column for 4 is 11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the base column is determined by the value modulo something. For example, 3 mod something gives 3, 4 mod something gives 11. But this isn't clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input's 2,3,4,8. If the base columns are:\n\n- 2 \u2192 4 (since in the test input, the 2 is in column 4)\n- 3 \u2192 11 (test input's 3 is in column 11)\n- 4 \u2192 20 (test input's 4 is in column 20)\n- 8 \u2192 24 (test input's 8 is in column 24)\n\nBut in Example 0, 3 is in column 3, 4 in 12, which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the base column for a number is its value multiplied by some factor. For example, 3*4=12. So 3's base column is 3, 4's is 12 (3*4). But this doesn't fit other examples.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I think the most plausible explanation is that the numbers in each row are moved to specific columns based on their value, and if there are multiple instances, they are placed consecutively starting from that column. The base columns for each number are determined by the training examples:\n\n- In Example 0, 3 is in column 3, 4 in column 12.\n- In Example 1, 2 is in column 3.\n- In Example 2, 8 is in column 7.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\n- 2 should be in column 4 (as in the test input rows) \u2192 but in Example 1, 2 is in column 3. Hmm, contradiction.\n- 3 in column 11 (test input's 3 is in column 11)\n- 4 in column 20\n- 8 in column 24 (test input's 8 is in column 24, but in Example 2, 8 is in column 7)\n\nThis inconsistency makes it difficult. Another approach: perhaps the base column is determined by the position of the first occurrence of the number in the input rows.\n\nIn the test input, the 2 first appears in column 4, 3 in 11, 4 in 20, 8 in 24. So perhaps the first occurrence's column becomes the base for that number.\n\nThus, in the output, each number is moved to its base column as per its first occurrence in the input, and if there are multiple instances, they are placed consecutively.\n\nApplying this:\n\n- For the test input's first row, the 2 is in column 4, 3 in 11, 4 in 20. So in the output, each of these numbers would be moved to their respective base columns, and any duplicates would be placed in consecutive columns.\n\nFor example, in a row with two 2s, they would be in columns 4 and 5.\n\nLooking at row 3 of the test input: it has two 2s (column 4 and 16). So in the output, these would be moved to columns 4 and 5.\n\nSimilarly, row 5 of the test input has an 8 in column 9. The first occurrence of 8 is in row 4, column 24. So in the output, the 8 in row 5 would move to column 24. But Example 2's 8 moves to column 7. This contradicts.\n\nThis suggests that the first occurrence's column isn't the base for all instances.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without a clear pattern, I'll need to make an educated guess.\n\nThe most consistent pattern across the training examples is that numbers are shifted to certain columns and grouped with others of the same value. For example, in Example 0, all 3s are in column 3 and 4s in column 12, and when there are multiple, they are adjacent. In Example 1, 2s are in column 3, and 4s in column 9. In Example 2, 8s are in column 7.\n\nApplying this to the test input, where the first occurrence of 2 is column 4, 3 in 11, 4 in 20, 8 in 24. So in the output, each number would be shifted to their respective columns. For example:\n\n- 2 \u2192 column 4\n- 3 \u2192 column 11\n- 4 \u2192 column 20\n- 8 \u2192 column 24\n\nIf a row has multiple instances of the same number, they would be placed consecutively starting from their base column. For example, two 3s would be in 11 and 12.\n\nApplying this to the test input's rows:\n\nTake the third test row: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]. The two 2s would move to columns 4 and 5, the 3 to 11, and the 4 to 20. So the output row would have 2s at 4 and 5, 3 at 11, and 4 at 20.\n\nSimilarly, row 15 has two 4s (columns 20 and 24) and an 8 at 25. The 4s would be at 20 and 21, and the 8 at 24.\n\nBut this is speculative. Based on this, I'll generate the test output by moving each number to their respective base columns and grouping them consecutively if there are multiple.",
