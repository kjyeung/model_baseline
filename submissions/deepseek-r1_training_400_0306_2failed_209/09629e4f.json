        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists. Let's start by looking at the training examples to identify any common transformations.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure, each input and output is a list of 11 elements. The outputs in the examples often have sequences of the same numbers, like [2,2,2,5,...] or [0,0,0,5,...]. Also, the number 5 appears in the fourth position (index 3) in all input rows and remains in the same position in the output. That seems important. Maybe the 5s are fixed points, and the rest of the elements are transformed based on some rule related to their position relative to the 5s.\n\nLet's take Example 0. The first input row is [2,0,0,5,0,6,2,5,0,0,4]. The output is [2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. I notice that before the first 5 (at index 3), the first three elements are all turned into 2. Then between the two 5s (indices 3 and 7), the elements are turned to 0s. After the second 5 (index 7), the remaining elements are also 0s. Similarly, in other rows of the output, there are triplets of the same number around the 5s.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, each row is split into three segments separated by 5s. The first segment (before the first 5) has three elements replaced by a single number repeated. The middle segment (between the two 5s) also has three elements replaced by another number. The last segment (after the second 5) has three elements replaced by a third number. But the input rows have varying numbers. How are these replacement numbers determined?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input row 0: the first three elements are 2,0,0. The output is 2,2,2. So maybe the first triplet's value is the maximum, minimum, or sum of those three? Let's check. The sum is 2+0+0=2. The output is 2. So perhaps the first triplet's value is the sum of the three elements before the first 5. Then the middle triplet (elements 4-6, indices 4,5,6) in the input are 0,6,2. Sum is 8. But the output for that segment is 0. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe the sum modulo something? Or maybe it's the average. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first triplet in the output is the sum of the non-zero elements before the first 5. In the first input row, before the first 5 (elements 0-2) we have 2,0,0. Non-zero sum is 2. So output is 2. For the middle segment (elements 4-6) in the input: 0,6,2. Sum is 8, but output is 0. That doesn't fit. Wait, the output here is 0,0,0. Maybe the sum is zero? But 0+6+2=8. So maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output values are determined by the counts of certain numbers. For example, the first triplet in the input might have a majority number. Let's see: in the first input row, elements 0-2 are 2,0,0. The majority is 0, but the output is 2. Hmm, no. Or maybe the first non-zero number? The first element is 2, so that could explain the 2s. Then in the middle triplet (indices 4-6) of input row 0: 0,6,2. The first non-zero is 6. But the output is 0. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's look at another example. Take Example 1's output. The first triplet in the output is 0,0,0. The input's first three elements are 2,0,3. Sum is 5, but output is 0. So that approach might not work. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the positions of the 5s. In all input rows, the 5s are at positions 3 and 7. The output rows also have 5s at those positions. So each row is split into three parts: first three elements, then three elements between the 5s, then three elements after the second 5. The 5s are fixed. So the transformation applies to these three segments (each of three elements) and the last element (but wait, the input and output have 11 elements. So positions 3 and 7 are 5s. The segments are:\n\n- Positions 0-2 (three elements)\n- Positions 4-6 (three elements)\n- Positions 8-10 (three elements)\n\nEach of these segments in the output is filled with a single value repeated three times. The question is: what determines that value for each segment.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row:\n\nInput: [2,0,0,5,0,6,2,5,0,0,4]\n\nFirst segment (0-2): 2,0,0 \u2192 output 2,2,2. So the value is 2. How is 2 derived from 2,0,0? Maybe the sum is 2. Or perhaps the maximum is 2. The maximum here is 2, which matches the output.\n\nMiddle segment (4-6): 0,6,2. The maximum here is 6. But the output is 0. So that doesn't fit. Wait, the output for this segment is 0. So maybe the minimum? The minimum is 0. That matches. So perhaps each segment's output value is the minimum of the input segment.\n\nWait, let's check other examples. Let's take Example 1's first input row:\n\nInput: [2,0,3,5,4,6,0,5,0,6,0]\n\nFirst segment (0-2): 2,0,3. The max is 3, min is 0. The output is 0,0,0. So min here is 0, which matches. Middle segment (4-6):4,6,0. Min is 0. Output for that segment is 0. But in Example 1's output, the middle segment (4-6) is 0,0,0. Wait, but the output for the middle segment in Example 1's first row is 0,0,0 (since the output row is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,2,2,2]). Wait, no, looking at Example 1's output:\n\nFirst output row: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,2,2,2]. So the middle segment (positions 4-6) are 0,0,0. The input's middle segment here is 4,6,0. So the min is 0, which matches. The last segment (positions 8-10) in input are 0,6,0. Min is 0, but output is 2,2,2. That doesn't fit. So maybe the min isn't the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum modulo some number. Let's see. For the first segment of Example 0: sum 2+0+0=2. Output is 2. For Example 1's first input segment: 2+0+3=5. Output is 0. 5 mod 5 is 0. Maybe sum mod 5. But 2 mod 5 is 2, which works. Then in Example 1's first segment sum 5 mod5=0, which matches the output 0. Let's check the middle segment in Example 0's input: 0+6+2=8. 8 mod5=3. But the output is 0. Doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAnother idea: the output value is the first non-zero number in the segment. For Example 0's first segment: 2 is the first non-zero. Output 2. For Example 1's first segment: 2 is first non-zero. But the output is 0. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the output segments are determined by the first number in the input segment. Let's see. For Example 0's first segment: first number is 2 \u2192 output 2. Middle segment starts with 0 \u2192 output 0. Last segment starts with 0 \u2192 output 0. But in the output, the last segment is 0,0,0. So that matches. For Example 1's first input row: first segment starts with 2. Output is 0. That doesn't fit. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output value is the number that appears most frequently in the input segment. For Example 0's first segment: 2,0,0. The most frequent is 0 (twice), but output is 2. So no. That's not it.\n\nLet me think again. Let's take the first training example and compare input and output rows. Let's look at the entire structure.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first three rows are all [2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Then the next three rows are [0,0,0,5,4,4,4,5,3,3,3]. Then the fifth row is [5,5,5,...], which is the same as the input. Then the next three rows are [6,6,6,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. \n\nWait, the output seems to group the rows into blocks of three, except for the middle row which is all 5s. Looking at the input, the fourth row in the input is all 5s, and in the output it's the same. So maybe the transformation is applied to groups of three rows, each transformed into three output rows with certain patterns, and the all-5 rows are kept as is.\n\nLooking at the input of Example 0: the first three input rows are:\n\n[2,0,0,5,0,6,2,5,0,0,4]\n\n[0,4,3,5,4,0,8,5,3,0,6]\n\n[6,0,0,5,3,0,0,5,8,0,2]\n\nThe output for these three rows is three identical rows of [2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. \n\nSo how do these three input rows relate to the output's three rows? Let's see each segment in the input rows.\n\nFirst segment (elements 0-2) across the three input rows:\n\nRow0: 2,0,0\n\nRow1:0,4,3\n\nRow2:6,0,0\n\nThe output for the first segment is 2,2,2 for all three rows. So how is 2 derived from these three input segments?\n\nMaybe for each block of three rows, the first segment's output is determined by some aggregation of the three input segments. For example, sum all the elements in the first segments of the three input rows: 2+0+0 + 0+4+3 +6+0+0 = 2+7+6=15. Maybe 15 divided by something? But 15 mod5=0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum value in the three input segments. Let's see:\n\nRow0 first segment: max 2\n\nRow1: max 4\n\nRow2: max 6\n\nBut the output for all three rows is 2. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, the minimum of the three maxes? 2,4,6 \u2192 min is 2. So that could be. Then all three rows get 2 for the first segment. That matches the output. \n\nLet's check the middle segments. For the first three rows in Example0:\n\nMiddle segments (elements 4-6):\n\nRow0:0,6,2 \u2192 sum 8, max 6, min 0\n\nRow1:4,0,8 \u2192 sum 12, max 8, min 0\n\nRow2:3,0,0 \u2192 sum 3, max 3, min 0\n\nThe output middle segments are 0,0,0. So perhaps the minimum of the min values across these three rows. The min for each row's middle segment is 0,0,0. So aggregate could be 0, leading to 0s.\n\nSimilarly, the last segments (elements 8-10):\n\nRow0:0,0,4 \u2192 min 0, max 4\n\nRow1:3,0,6 \u2192 min 0, max 6\n\nRow2:8,0,2 \u2192 min 0, max 8\n\nOutput last segments are 0,0,0. So again, taking the min (0) from all these min values.\n\nBut how does this apply to other examples?\n\nTake Example1's first three input rows:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[2,0,3,5,4,6,0,5,0,6,0]\n\n[0,0,8,5,0,0,2,5,4,0,3]\n\n[4,6,0,5,3,8,0,5,2,0,8]\n\nOutput first three rows are [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,2,2,2].\n\nFirst segments (0-2):\n\nRow0:2,0,3 \u2192 min 0, max3, sum5\n\nRow1:0,0,8 \u2192 min0, max8, sum8\n\nRow2:4,6,0 \u2192 min0, max6, sum10\n\nThe output for first segments is 0. If we take the minimum of all the min values (0 from each), then yes. So output 0.\n\nMiddle segments (4-6):\n\nRow0:4,6,0 \u2192 min0\n\nRow1:0,0,2 \u2192 min0\n\nRow2:3,8,0 \u2192 min0\n\nSo aggregate min 0. Output 0.\n\nLast segments (8-10):\n\nRow0:0,6,0 \u2192 min0\n\nRow1:4,0,3 \u2192 min0\n\nRow2:2,0,8 \u2192 min0\n\nSo aggregate min 0. But output here is 2,2,2. Wait, that contradicts. So the previous idea doesn't hold here.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the aggregation might not be based on the min of the min values. Let's look again.\n\nIn Example1's output for the first three rows, the last segments (positions 8-10) are 2,2,2. The input segments are:\n\nRow0:0,6,0 \u2192 sum6 \u2192 6 mod5=1. But output is 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum of the max values in the last segments. For Example1's first three input rows:\n\nRow0's last segment max is 6.\n\nRow1's is 4.\n\nRow2's is 8.\n\nMax of these is 8. But output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the max values: 6+4+8=18. 18 mod something? 18 mod 5 is 3, not 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of non-zero elements in the three segments. Let's see:\n\nFor Example1's last segments:\n\nRow0:0,6,0 \u2192 one non-zero.\n\nRow1:4,0,3 \u2192 two non-zero.\n\nRow2:2,0,8 \u2192 two non-zero.\n\nTotal: 1+2+2=5. 5 mod5=0. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the first elements in each segment. For the last segments:\n\nRow0's first element is 0.\n\nRow1's is 4.\n\nRow2's is 2.\n\nSum:0+4+2=6. 6 mod5=1. Not 2.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs, each of the three-row blocks in the output has identical rows. So each block of three input rows is transformed into three identical output rows. Also, the middle row of the input (all 5s) is kept as is.\n\nSo the key might be that the three input rows in a block are processed into three output rows with the same pattern. The pattern is determined by some aggregation of the three input rows in each segment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each three-row block is transformed into three output rows where each segment's value is the sum of the corresponding elements in the input rows modulo something.\n\nFor example, in Example0's first three input rows, first segment:\n\nRow0: 2,0,0\n\nRow1:0,4,3\n\nRow2:6,0,0\n\nSum across each position:\n\n2+0+6=8 (first element)\n\n0+4+0=4 (second)\n\n0+3+0=3 (third)\n\nBut the output is 2,2,2. So 8,4,3 don't directly lead to 2. Unless each is taken modulo something. 8 mod5=3, 4 mod5=4, 3 mod5=3. Doesn't match 2.\n\nAlternatively, sum all elements in the three input rows' first segments: (2+0+0) + (0+4+3) + (6+0+0) = 2 +7 +6=15. 15 mod5=0. Output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the output for each segment is the value that appears in the majority of the three input rows for that segment. For Example0's first segment:\n\nRow0:2,0,0 \u2192 majority 0.\n\nRow1:0,4,3 \u2192 majority 0.\n\nRow2:6,0,0 \u2192 majority 0.\n\nBut output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output for each segment is the maximum value across all three input rows for that segment. For Example0's first segment:\n\nRow0 has max 2, Row1 has max4, Row2 has max6. So overall max is6. But output is 2. No.\n\nAlternatively, the minimum across all three rows. Min of 2,0,6 is 0. Output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try a different approach. Let's look at the test input and see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [6,4,0,5,0,3,0,5,0,4,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,3,5,2,8,6,5,8,0,2]\n\nRow2: [2,0,8,5,4,0,0,5,6,3,0]\n\nThen the all-5 row.\n\nThen:\n\nRow4: [2,0,0,5,0,3,0,5,3,6,2]\n\nRow5: [3,4,6,5,8,4,2,5,0,0,4]\n\nRow6: [0,8,0,5,0,0,6,5,8,0,0]\n\nAll-5 row.\n\nThen:\n\nRow8: [0,2,4,5,0,6,4,5,0,2,8]\n\nRow9: [0,6,3,5,0,0,3,5,4,0,6]\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,5,2,0,8,5,3,0,0]\n\nThe expected output would be three blocks of three rows each, separated by all-5 rows.\n\nIn the first block (rows 0-2), the first segments (0-2) would be replaced by a single number. Let's see the first three input rows' first segments:\n\nRow0:6,4,0 \u2192 sum 10, max 6, min 0\n\nRow1:0,0,3 \u2192 sum3, max3, min0\n\nRow2:2,0,8 \u2192 sum10, max8, min0\n\nAssuming the output for the first segment is the minimum of the three min values (all 0), but looking at the training examples, when the input segments have varying mins, maybe it's the sum of the first elements of each input row's first segment. For rows0-2, first elements are 6,0,2. Sum is 8. Mod 5 gives 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for the first segment is the sum of the first elements of each input row in that segment. For example, rows0-2 first elements are 6,0,2. Sum is 8. Maybe 8 mod 5=3, but the output would be 3,3,3. Not sure if that's the case.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, in Example0's first block, the first elements of the three input rows are 2,0,6. Sum 8. Output is 2,2,2. 8 mod something? If mod 6, 8 mod6=2. But why 6? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the average. 8/3 \u2248 2.666, rounded down to 2. That could work for Example0. Then for the Test Input's first segment sum 6+0+2=8, divided by3 is ~2.666, so output 2? But in Example1's first block, first elements are 2,0,4. Sum 6. 6/3=2. But the output there is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Let me try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output rows, each triplet is replaced by the same number. For instance, in Example0's output, the first triplet is 2,2,2. The input's first three rows' first triplet sums are 2,7,6. Sum of sums: 15. Maybe 15 divided by 5 (number of 5s?) gives 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output value is the number of non-zero elements in the three input segments. For Example0's first triplet:\n\nRow0 has 1 non-zero (2).\n\nRow1 has two non-zero (4,3).\n\nRow2 has one non-zero (6).\n\nTotal non-zero: 1+2+1=4. Output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: in the output, each segment's value is the same as the middle element of the corresponding segment in the input's middle row of the block. Let's check Example0's first block.\n\nThe first three input rows:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0,5,0,6,2,5,0,0,4]\n\nRow1: [0,4,3,5,4,0,8,5,3,0,6]\n\nRow2: [6,0,0,5,3,0,0,5,8,0,2]\n\nMiddle row is row1. For the first segment (0-2) in row1: 0,4,3. Middle element is 4. But output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output value is the sum of the middle elements of each row's segment. For Example0's first segment:\n\nRow0's middle element (index1):0\n\nRow1's:4\n\nRow2's:0\n\nSum:0+4+0=4. Output is 2. 4/2=2. But why divide by 2?\n\nNot sure.\n\nLet's think of the outputs again. Each output row has three segments of three elements each. For example, in Example0's first output row:\n\n[2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nThe segments are 2,2,2 | 0,0,0 | 0,0,0.\n\nLooking at the input rows for this block, perhaps each segment's value in the output is determined by the first occurrence of a certain number in the corresponding segments of the input rows. For example, the first non-zero number in any of the input segments. Let's see:\n\nExample0's first segment in input rows:\n\nRow0:2,0,0 \u2192 first non-zero 2.\n\nRow1:0,4,3 \u2192 first non-zero 4.\n\nRow2:6,0,0 \u2192 first non-zero 6.\n\nThe output is 2. Hmm, why 2? Maybe the minimum of these first non-zero numbers (2,4,6 \u2192 min 2). That would fit. For the first segment in Example0, output is 2.\n\nFor the middle segment in Example0's input:\n\nRow0's middle segment (4-6):0,6,2 \u2192 first non-zero is 6.\n\nRow1's:4,0,8 \u2192 first non-zero 4.\n\nRow2's:3,0,0 \u2192 first non-zero 3.\n\nThe output is 0. But the minimum of 6,4,3 is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the sum of the first non-zero numbers: 2+4+6=12. 12 mod5=2. Output is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the average of the first non-zero numbers: (2+4+6)/3=4. Output is 0. No.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look at another example. Example3's first three input rows:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[3,8,4,5,4,6,0,5,2,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,5,8,0,3,5,6,0,3]\n\n[6,2,0,5,0,2,0,5,4,0,0]\n\nOutput first three rows are all [0,0,0,5,4,4,4,5,0,0,0].\n\nFirst segments (0-2) in input:\n\nRow0:3,8,4 \u2192 first non-zero 3.\n\nRow1:0,0,0 \u2192 no non-zero. So maybe 0.\n\nRow2:6,2,0 \u2192 first non-zero 6.\n\nThe output is 0 for the first segment. How does that come about? The minimum of 3,0,6 is 0. That could fit. Because if any of the first non-zero in a segment is zero (like row1's segment being all zeros), then the minimum would be zero. So for Example3's first segment, min(3,0,6)=0. Output is 0. That makes sense.\n\nFor the middle segment (4-6) of Example3's input:\n\nRow0:4,6,0 \u2192 first non-zero 4.\n\nRow1:8,0,3 \u2192 first non-zero 8.\n\nRow2:0,2,0 \u2192 first non-zero 2.\n\nMinimum of 4,8,2 is 2. But output is 4,4,4. Wait, that doesn't fit. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the output segments are the sum of the first elements of each input row's segment. For Example0's first segment:\n\nRow0 first element:2\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:6\n\nSum:8. Output is 2. 8 mod 5=3. Not 2.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output for each segment is the sum of all elements in that segment across all three input rows, divided by the number of non-zero elements.\n\nFor Example0's first segment:\n\nSum:2+0+0 (Row0) +0+4+3 (Row1) +6+0+0 (Row2) = 2 +7 +6 =15. Number of non-zero elements: 2 (from Row0) +2 (Row1) +1 (Row2) =5. 15/5=3. Output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nAnother idea: each output segment is the count of non-zero elements in the three input rows' segments. For Example0's first segment:\n\nRow0:1 non-zero (2)\n\nRow1:2 non-zero (4,3)\n\nRow2:1 non-zero (6)\n\nTotal non-zero:4. Output is 2. 4/2=2. Maybe? But why divide by 2?\n\nAlternatively, the average number of non-zero per row:4/3 \u22481.33, rounded to 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of non-zero elements. For Example0's first segment:\n\nRow0:2\n\nRow1:4+3=7\n\nRow2:6\n\nSum:2+7+6=15. 15 mod5=0. Output is2. No.\n\nThis is really perplexing. Let's try to look for a pattern in the output segments and how they relate to the input rows.\n\nAnother observation: In Example0's output, the first three rows have 2,0,0 in the first segment. The corresponding input's first segments have 2,0,0; 0,4,3; 6,0,0. The output for the first segment is 2,2,2. So maybe the first row's first segment is the dominant value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each block of three input rows is being processed to generate three output rows where each segment's value is determined by a certain digit from the input.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's first three output rows, the first segment is 2, which is the first element of the first input row's first segment. Similarly, in Example1's first output block, the first segment is 0, which is the first element of the first input row's first segment (which is 2,0,3). Wait, no. The first element of the first input row's first segment is 2. Output is 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output value is the first non-zero element in the entire block for that segment. For Example0's first segment:\n\nLooking across all three input rows' first segments:\n\nRow0:2,0,0 \u2192 first non-zero 2.\n\nRow1:0,4,3 \u2192 first non-zero 4.\n\nRow2:6,0,0 \u2192 first non-zero 6.\n\nThe first non-zero in the entire block is 2 (from row0). So output is 2.\n\nFor Example1's first segment:\n\nRow0:2,0,3 \u2192 first non-zero 2.\n\nRow1:0,0,8 \u2192 first non-zero 8.\n\nRow2:4,6,0 \u2192 first non-zero4.\n\nThe first non-zero in the entire block (row0, row1, row2) is 2. But the output for Example1's first segment is 0. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the test input. Maybe there's a pattern where each segment's output is the minimum value in the entire block for that segment.\n\nTest input first block (rows 0-2):\n\nFirst segment (0-2):\n\nRow0:6,4,0 \u2192 values 6,4,0.\n\nRow1:0,0,3 \u21920,0,3.\n\nRow2:2,0,8 \u21922,0,8.\n\nThe minimum value across all these elements is 0 (present in all three rows). So output would be 0,0,0 for the first segment.\n\nMiddle segment (4-6):\n\nRow0:0,3,0 \u21920,3,0.\n\nRow1:2,8,6 \u21922,8,6.\n\nRow2:4,0,0 \u21924,0,0.\n\nThe minimum across all elements here is 0. So output would be 0,0,0.\n\nLast segment (8-10):\n\nRow0:0,4,0 \u21920,4,0.\n\nRow1:8,0,2 \u21928,0,2.\n\nRow2:6,3,0 \u21926,3,0.\n\nMinimum across all elements is 0. So output 0,0,0.\n\nSo the first three output rows would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] repeated three times.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, like Example0's first three output rows are [2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0], which would imply that the first segment's minimum was 2. But in Example0's first segment across the three rows, the elements are 2,0,0; 0,4,3; 6,0,0. The minimum across all elements here is 0 (from multiple places). So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nI must be missing something. Let's look at another example.\n\nExample2's output for the first three rows is [0,0,0,5,3,3,3,5,0,0,0]. The input's first three rows are:\n\nRow0:0,3,0,5,0,6,3,5,0,6,2\n\nRow1:6,0,4,5,2,8,0,5,0,0,8\n\nRow2:0,2,8,5,0,4,0,5,3,0,4\n\nFirst segments (0-2):\n\nRow0:0,3,0 \u2192 elements 0,3,0.\n\nRow1:6,0,4 \u21926,0,4.\n\nRow2:0,2,8 \u21920,2,8.\n\nMinimum across all elements is 0. But the output first segment is 0,0,0. That fits.\n\nMiddle segments (4-6):\n\nRow0:0,6,3 \u21920,6,3.\n\nRow1:2,8,0 \u21922,8,0.\n\nRow2:0,4,0 \u21920,4,0.\n\nMinimum across all elements is 0. Output middle segment is3,3,3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this theory isn't working.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe each output segment is the sum of the first elements of each row in that segment. For example, in Example0's first segment:\n\nRow0 first element:2\n\nRow1 first element:0\n\nRow2 first element:6\n\nSum:2+0+6=8. Output is 2. 8 mod something equals 2. Maybe mod 6. 8 mod6=2. Yes. Then for the middle segment:\n\nRow0 first element of middle segment (element4) is0.\n\nRow1's is4.\n\nRow2's is3.\n\nSum:0+4+3=7. Mod6=1. Output is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, sum of the first elements of each segment in the three rows. For example0's first segment:\n\nRow0:2\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:6\n\nSum:8 \u2192 mod5=3, which isn't 2. But maybe mod 3? 8 mod3=2. Output is2. That fits. For the middle segment:\n\nRow0's middle segment first element is0.\n\nRow1's is4.\n\nRow2's is3.\n\nSum:0+4+3=7. Mod3=1. Output is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo this isn't working either.\n\nThis is very challenging. Let's try to think differently. The outputs have three repeated numbers in each segment, which might be derived from some property of the input rows in the same block. For example, maybe the first segment's value in the output is the sum of the first elements of each row in the block, then processed in some way.\n\nExample0's first block first elements sum:2+0+6=8. 8 mod5=3. But output is2.\n\nExample1's first block first elements sum:2+0+4=6. 6 mod5=1. Output is0.\n\nNo obvious pattern.\n\nWait, another observation: in the output, the middle segment's value often matches the fourth element of the input rows. For example, in Example0's first input row, the middle segment (elements4-6) are 0,6,2. The output for that segment is0. The fourth element in the input is5, which is fixed. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the value could be related to the elements before and after the 5s. For example, the first segment is before the first 5, and the output is the sum of elements before 5 in the input rows. For Example0's first row, elements before 5 (positions0-2) sum to2+0+0=2. Output is2. That fits. For the middle segment (elements4-6) sum is0+6+2=8. Output is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example0's first row, the output's middle segment is 0. Sum is8. 8 mod something equals0. 8 mod8=0. But why 8?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the average. 8/3\u22482.666, but output is0.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nWait, looking at the first row of Example0's input and output:\n\nInput: [2,0,0,5,0,6,2,5,0,0,4]\n\nOutput: [2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nThe output's first three elements are 2,2,2. The sum of the first three input elements is2+0+0=2. Output uses that sum as the value. For the middle segment (elements4-6:0,6,2), sum is8. Output is0. 8 mod something? Not sure. For the last segment (elements8-10:0,0,4), sum is4. Output is0. Hmm.\n\nIn Example0's second input row: [0,4,3,5,4,0,8,5,3,0,6]. Sum first three:0+4+3=7. Output is2. Doesn't fit. So sum doesn't directly determine the output.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps each segment's value in the output is the sum of the non-zero elements in the input segment. For Example0's first segment in row0:2. So output is2. For row0's middle segment:0+6+2=8 \u2192 output0. Doesn't fit. For last segment:0+0+4=4 \u2192 output0. No.\n\nAlternatively, the count of non-zero elements. For row0's first segment:1 non-zero. Output is2. No.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's try to find another angle. The outputs are grouped into three rows each, and each group has the same values. This suggests that the transformation is applied per block of three rows. Also, the all-5 row remains the same. So perhaps each block of three input rows is transformed into three output rows where each segment's value is derived from the corresponding segments in the input rows, but aggregated in some way.\n\nLooking at Example0's first block:\n\nInput rows 0-2:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0,5,0,6,2,5,0,0,4]\n\nRow1: [0,4,3,5,4,0,8,5,3,0,6]\n\nRow2: [6,0,0,5,3,0,0,5,8,0,2]\n\nOutput rows 0-2: [2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] repeated three times.\n\nLooking at the first segment (0-2) of output: 2,2,2. How is this derived? Let's look at the first segments of the input:\n\nRow0:2,0,0\n\nRow1:0,4,3\n\nRow2:6,0,0\n\nPerhaps the output is the minimum of the sums of each row's segment. \n\nRow0's sum:2.\n\nRow1's sum:7.\n\nRow2's sum:6.\n\nMinimum sum is 2. So output is 2. That fits. For the middle segment (elements4-6):\n\nRow0's sum:0+6+2=8.\n\nRow1's sum:4+0+8=12.\n\nRow2's sum:3+0+0=3.\n\nMinimum sum is3. But output is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maximum sum is12. Output is0. No.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each segment is the minimum value found in any of the three input rows' corresponding segments. For Example0's first segment, the values are:\n\nRow0's first segment min:0.\n\nRow1's min:0.\n\nRow2's min:0.\n\nOutput is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut wait, the output is 2. So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe for each block of three input rows, each segment's output value is the sum of all elements in that segment across all three input rows, then divided by the number of rows (3), and rounded down.\n\nExample0's first segment sum:2+0+0 +0+4+3 +6+0+0 =2+7+6=15. 15/3=5. Output is2. No.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of all elements in the segment across the three rows, then modulo 5.\n\n15 mod5=0. Output is2. No.\n\nAlternatively, sum mod3. 15 mod3=0. Output is2. No.\n\nThis is really frustrating. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the output is the sum of the first elements of each row in the block for that segment. \n\nFor Example0's first segment: row0's first element is2, row1's is0, row2's is6. Sum:8. Output is2. 8 mod6=2. So if mod6, it works. For Example1's first segment sum:2+0+4=6. 6 mod6=0. Output is0. That fits. For Example3's first segment sum:3+0+6=9 mod6=3. Output is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nNot consistent.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is the sum of the first elements of each row's segment multiplied by the number of non-zero elements in that segment across all three rows.\n\nFor Example0's first segment:\n\nRow0's first elements:2,0,0 \u2192 non-zero count1.\n\nRow1:0,4,3 \u2192 count2.\n\nRow2:6,0,0 \u2192 count1.\n\nTotal non-zero:4.\n\nSum of first elements:2+0+6=8.\n\n8 *4=32. 32 mod something. Not sure.\n\nThis seems too arbitrary.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's look at the positions of 5s. Each row has two 5s at positions 3 and 7. The output preserves these positions. So each row is divided into three parts:\n\n- Part A: positions 0-2 (3 elements)\n\n- Part B: positions 4-6 (3 elements)\n\n- Part C: positions 8-10 (3 elements)\n\nEach part in the output is filled with the same number three times. The question is, how is that number determined for each part.\n\nLooking at Example0's first output block:\n\nPart A:2,2,2.\n\nPart B:0,0,0.\n\nPart C:0,0,0.\n\nInput parts for block 0:\n\nPart A inputs:\n\nRow0:2,0,0 \u2192 sum 2.\n\nRow1:0,4,3 \u2192 sum7.\n\nRow2:6,0,0 \u2192 sum6.\n\nMaybe the output for part A is the minimum of the sums: min(2,7,6)=2. So output is2.\n\nPart B inputs:\n\nRow0:0,6,2 \u2192 sum8.\n\nRow1:4,0,8 \u2192 sum12.\n\nRow2:3,0,0 \u2192 sum3.\n\nMinimum sum is3. Output is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maximum sum is12. Output is0. No.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output for each part is the sum of the first elements of each row's part. For part A:\n\nRow0's first element:2.\n\nRow1's:0.\n\nRow2's:6.\n\nSum:8. Output is2. 8 mod6=2. If mod6, it works.\n\nPart B:\n\nRow0's first element of part B (element4):0.\n\nRow1's:4.\n\nRow2's:3.\n\nSum:7. 7 mod6=1. Output is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of all the elements in part A across all three input rows. For Example0's part A: sum 2+0+0+0+4+3+6+0+0=15. 15 mod5=0. Output is2. No.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's try to think of the test input and make a guess based on the training examples.\n\nTest Input's first three rows:\n\nRow0:6,4,0,5,0,3,0,5,0,4,0.\n\nRow1:0,0,3,5,2,8,6,5,8,0,2.\n\nRow2:2,0,8,5,4,0,0,5,6,3,0.\n\nFor part A (positions0-2):\n\nRow0:6,4,0.\n\nRow1:0,0,3.\n\nRow2:2,0,8.\n\nThe output for part A could be the minimum value among the minimums of each row's part A. \n\nRow0's min:0.\n\nRow1's min:0.\n\nRow2's min:0.\n\nSo output is0,0,0.\n\nFor part B (positions4-6):\n\nRow0:0,3,0.\n\nRow1:2,8,6.\n\nRow2:4,0,0.\n\nMinimum of each row's part B:\n\nRow0:0.\n\nRow1:2.\n\nRow2:0.\n\nOverall minimum:0. So output0,0,0.\n\nPart C (positions8-10):\n\nRow0:0,4,0.\n\nRow1:8,0,2.\n\nRow2:6,3,0.\n\nMinimum of each row's part C:\n\nRow0:0.\n\nRow1:0.\n\nRow2:0.\n\nOverall minimum:0. So output0,0,0.\n\nSo the first three output rows would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] each.\n\nNext block of input rows (rows4-6):\n\nRow4:2,0,0,5,0,3,0,5,3,6,2.\n\nRow5:3,4,6,5,8,4,2,5,0,0,4.\n\nRow6:0,8,0,5,0,0,6,5,8,0,0.\n\nPart A (0-2):\n\nRow4:2,0,0 \u2192 min0.\n\nRow5:3,4,6 \u2192 min3.\n\nRow6:0,8,0 \u2192 min0.\n\nOverall min0. So output0,0,0.\n\nPart B (4-6):\n\nRow4:0,3,0 \u2192 min0.\n\nRow5:8,4,2 \u2192 min2.\n\nRow6:0,0,6 \u2192 min0.\n\nOverall min0. Output0,0,0.\n\nPart C (8-10):\n\nRow4:3,6,2 \u2192 min2.\n\nRow5:0,0,4 \u2192 min0.\n\nRow6:8,0,0 \u2192 min0.\n\nOverall min0. Output0,0,0.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, some output blocks have non-zero values. For example, Example0's middle block has [0,0,0,5,4,4,4,5,3,3,3]. So maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe for each part in a block, the output is the value that appears in the majority of the input rows' part. For example, in Example0's first block part A:\n\nRow0:2,0,0 \u2192 has 2 and 0s.\n\nRow1:0,4,3 \u2192 0,4,3.\n\nRow2:6,0,0 \u2192 6 and 0s.\n\nThe majority number in part A across all three rows is 0 (appears in all three rows). But the output is2. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the most frequent number in the part across all three rows. For Example0's part A:\n\nNumbers present:2,0,0,0,4,3,6,0,0. The most frequent is0. Output is2. So no.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe the answer is to look for the sum of all elements in the three rows for each part, then take modulo 5.\n\nExample0's part A sum:2+0+0+0+4+3+6+0+0=15 \u219215 mod5=0. Output is2. No.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the first elements of each part in the three rows.\n\nExample0's part A first elements:2,0,6 \u2192 sum8. 8 mod5=3. Output is2. No.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the patterns I can see. In the training examples, the output for each three-row block has each segment set to a single value. Looking at the test input's first three rows:\n\nFirst three rows of test input:\n\nRow0:6,4,0,5,0,3,0,5,0,4,0\n\nRow1:0,0,3,5,2,8,6,5,8,0,2\n\nRow2:2,0,8,5,4,0,0,5,6,3,0\n\nAssuming the first block's output is three rows where each segment is the minimum value from the corresponding segments in the three input rows, but aggregated across the entire block.\n\nFor part A (0-2):\n\nThe elements across all three rows are 6,4,0, 0,0,3, 2,0,8. The minimum value here is0. So part A would be0,0,0.\n\nPart B (4-6): elements 0,3,0, 2,8,6, 4,0,0. Minimum is0.\n\nPart C (8-10): elements0,4,0,8,0,2,6,3,0. Minimum is0.\n\nSo the first three output rows would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] repeated three times.\n\nNext block (rows4-6):\n\nInput rows4-6:\n\nRow4:2,0,0,5,0,3,0,5,3,6,2\n\nRow5:3,4,6,5,8,4,2,5,0,0,4\n\nRow6:0,8,0,5,0,0,6,5,8,0,0\n\nPart A (0-2): 2,0,0;3,4,6;0,8,0. Minimum across all elements is0.\n\nPart B (4-6):0,3,0;8,4,2;0,0,6. Minimum is0.\n\nPart C (8-10):3,6,2;0,0,4;8,0,0. Minimum is0.\n\nSo output would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0], but looking at the training examples, some blocks have non-zero outputs. This suggests that my approach is incorrect, but given time constraints, I'll proceed with this.\n\nFor the third block (rows8-10):\n\nInput rows8-10:\n\nRow8:0,2,4,5,0,6,4,5,0,2,8\n\nRow9:0,6,3,5,0,0,3,5,4,0,6\n\nRow10:0,0,0,5,2,0,8,5,3,0,0\n\nPart A (0-2):0,2,4;0,6,3;0,0,0. Minimum is0.\n\nPart B (4-6):0,6,4;0,0,3;2,0,8. Minimum is0.\n\nPart C (8-10):0,2,8;4,0,6;3,0,0. Minimum is0.\n\nSo output would be all zeros except for the 5s. But in the training examples, like Example0's third block has6,6,6 for part A. So this approach is incorrect. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to apply the pattern from the examples. In Example0, the first three rows' output is 2,2,2 for part A. Looking back, the input's part A for those rows have varying elements. The only commonality I can see is that the sum of the first elements of each row's part A (2+0+6=8) and 8 mod6=2. Maybe mod6.\n\nApplying this to the test input's first three rows' part A:6+0+2=8 mod6=2. So output part A is2,2,2.\n\nBut the middle part's sum of first elements:0+2+4=6 mod6=0. Output part B 0,0,0.\n\nLast part:0+8+6=14 mod6=2. Output part C 2,2,2.\n\nSo the first three output rows would be [2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,2,2,2]. But looking at the training examples, this doesn't align with how parts are handled. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the first elements of each part across the three rows, modulo 5. \n\nTest input part A sum:6+0+2=8 mod5=3. Output 3,3,3. Not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the assumption that each block's segments are determined by the sum of the first elements modulo 5.\n\nBut given the complexity, I'll follow the pattern observed in the examples where each block's output segments are determined by certain values derived from the input rows. For the test input, perhaps the output would be:\n\nFirst block (rows0-2):\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nThen the all-5 row.\n\nSecond block (rows4-6):\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nThen the all-5 row.\n\nThird block (rows8-10):\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nBut this seems unlikely, as training examples have varying values. However, given the time and lack of a clear pattern, I'll make a guess based on Example0's pattern where the output segments are derived from the minimum of the input segments' sums or similar.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find a pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me look at the examples carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 0. The input has multiple rows, each of length 11. The output seems to have groups of three rows each, followed by a row of all 5s. Wait, in the output of Example 0, the first three rows are [2,2,2,5,...], then a row of 5s, then three rows starting with 0s, then 5s again, then three rows starting with 6s. So maybe the input is being transformed by grouping rows into triples (except the middle row of 5s) and applying some transformation.\n\nLooking at the inputs, the middle row in each example is all 5s, which remains the same in the output. So the middle row (position 3, 7, etc.) is just 5s. That's probably a fixed point.\n\nNow, looking at the non-5 rows. Let's compare input and output for Example 0. The first input row is [2,0,0,5,0,6,2,5,0,0,4]. The corresponding output is [2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Notice that the fourth element is 5, and the eighth element is also 5. So maybe positions 3 and 7 (0-indexed) are fixed as 5. So in the output, those positions are 5, same as input. Then, the elements before 5 (positions 0-2) are all set to the first non-zero value in those positions in the input group. For example, in the first three input rows of Example 0:\n\nFirst input row: [2,0,0,...]\nSecond input row: [0,4,3,...]\nThird input row: [6,0,0,...]\nBut the output's first three rows all start with 2,2,2. Wait, the first input row's first element is 2, the second is 0, third is 0. So maybe in the output, the first three elements of each group are the first non-zero number in that group's corresponding positions. Wait, but in Example 0's first group, the output's first three elements are 2,2,2. The first element of the first input row is 2, others in the group are 0 and 6. Wait, maybe it's taking the first non-zero in the vertical column of the group. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the first column of the first three input rows in Example 0:\nRow 0: 2\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2:6\nSo the first three output rows have the first element as 2. So maybe it's taking the first non-zero value in the column of the group. But in the input group, row 0's first element is 2, row1 is 0, row2 is6. But the output's first three rows all have 2 in the first position. So perhaps, for each column in the group, take the first non-zero value from the top in that column of the group and set all three rows in the output group to that value. Let's check another column.\n\nTake the second column (index 1) in the first group of Example0 input:\nRow0:0\nRow1:4\nRow2:0\nSo the output's second element in the first three rows is 2,2,2? Wait, no. Wait the output's first three rows are [2,2,2,5,...]. Wait, the second element in the output is 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grouping. Wait, maybe each group is three consecutive rows, and each group is processed into three output rows where each triplet in the group is replaced by the first non-zero element in their positions across the three rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is grouping the input rows into triplets (excluding the middle 5s row), and for each triplet of rows, each position (column) in the output triplet is set to the first non-zero value encountered in that column across the three input rows. If all are zero, then zero.\n\nFor example, in Example0's first triplet:\n\nInput rows:\nRow0: [2,0,0,5,0,6,2,5,0,0,4]\nRow1: [0,4,3,5,4,0,8,5,3,0,6]\nRow2: [6,0,0,5,3,0,0,5,8,0,2]\n\nFor each column in the output triplet (three rows), the first non-zero in that column across the three input rows becomes the value for all three output rows in that column. For example:\n\nColumn0: 2 (row0), then 0 (row1), then6 (row2). First non-zero is 2. So output column0 for all three rows is 2.\n\nColumn1: 0 (row0), 4 (row1), 0 (row2). First non-zero is 4. But in the output, column1 is 2 for all three rows. Wait that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the output rows in a group have the same values except for the 5s. Let me check the output for the first group in Example0:\n\nOutput:\n[2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n[2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n[2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nSo columns 0,1,2 are 2,2,2. Then column3 is 5. Then columns4-10 follow some pattern. Columns4-6: 0,0,0. Column7:5. Columns8-10:0,0,0.\n\nLooking at the input for columns4-6 in the first group:\n\nRow0:0,6,2\nRow1:4,0,8\nRow2:3,0,0\n\nSo for column4 (index4) in input group: 0,4,3. The first non-zero is 4. But the output column4 is 0. Hmm, that contradicts. Wait maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the sum or some operation. Or maybe it's grouping the columns into sections. Wait, the 5s are in positions3 and7. So columns3 and7 are fixed as 5. Let's look at the output's structure. The output seems to have three sections separated by 5s. For example, in the first output row of Example0: [2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. So three 2s, then 5, three 0s, 5, three 0s. So the positions are grouped into [0-2], [3], [4-6], [7], [8-10]. Each of these groups in the output is set to a single value. For the first group [0-2], they are 2,2,2. For [4-6], 0,0,0. For [8-10], 0,0,0. So perhaps for each of these three-element segments (excluding the 5s at position3 and7), the output sets all three elements in the segment to a certain value. But how is that value determined from the input?\n\nLooking at the first segment (0-2) in Example0's first input group:\n\nRow0:2,0,0\nRow1:0,4,3\nRow2:6,0,0\n\nThe output for segment0-2 is 2,2,2. So maybe taking the first non-zero in the entire segment across all three rows. The first non-zero in the first column is 2 (from row0), so the entire segment is set to 2. Similarly, for the second segment (4-6) in input rows:\n\nRow0:0,6,2\nRow1:4,0,8\nRow2:3,0,0\n\nThe first non-zero in column4 is 0 (row0), then 4 (row1), then3 (row2). So first non-zero in column4 is 0? No, row0's column4 is 0. Then row1's is4, which is first non-zero. But in output, segment4-6 is all zeros. That doesn't fit. Hmm, this approach might not be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each segment (0-2,4-6,8-10), the value is the first non-zero in the input's corresponding segment across the entire group (three rows). For example, segment0-2 in the first group's input has the elements:\n\nRow0:2,0,0\nRow1:0,4,3\nRow2:6,0,0\n\nLooking for the first non-zero in the entire segment, scanning all three rows. The first non-zero in the first position (row0, col0) is2. So the segment in output becomes 2,2,2.\n\nFor the segment4-6:\n\nRow0:0,6,2\nRow1:4,0,8\nRow2:3,0,0\n\nThe first non-zero in segment4 across the three rows. Row0, col4 is0. Row1, col4 is4. So the first non-zero is4. Then the segment4-6 would be4,4,4. But in the output, this segment is0,0,0. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the output segments again. For Example0's first group, the segment4-6 is 0,0,0. The input's segment4-6 for row0 is 0,6,2. Row1:4,0,8. Row2:3,0,0. The output for this segment is all 0. So how does that happen?\n\nWait, maybe it's taking the sum of the first non-zero in each column of the segment. Wait, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the entire segment is set to the first non-zero value in the entire segment (all three rows and three columns). For example, the first segment (0-2) has values 2,0,0 (row0), 0,4,3 (row1),6,0,0 (row2). The first non-zero in this entire 3x3 grid is2. So the output for that segment is filled with2.\n\nFor the segment4-6 (positions4,5,6), the input has:\n\nRow0:0,6,2 \u2192 positions4=0,5=6,6=2\n\nRow1:4,0,8 \u21924,0,8\n\nRow2:3,0,0 \u21923,0,0\n\nSo the first non-zero in the entire 3x3 grid here would be0 (row0, col4?), no, wait, the first non-zero when scanning row by row, column by column. Let's see:\n\nLooking for the first non-zero in this 3x3 grid (rows 0-2, cols4-6):\n\nRow0, col4:0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow0, col5:6 \u2192 yes. So first non-zero is6. So the segment would be6,6,6. But the output is0,0,0. That doesn't match. Hmm. So this approach is not working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the segments in the output are determined by the first non-zero in each column of the input group. For example, each column in the input group (three rows) is processed into a single value for the output's three rows. For example, column0 in the first group is 2,0,6. The first non-zero is2. So all three output rows in column0 become2. Column1:0,4,0 \u2192 first non-zero is4. But in the output, column1 is2. That's conflicting. So this can't be right.\n\nWait, looking at the output for Example0's first group, columns0-2 are all2. The input columns0 across three rows are 2,0,6. Maybe the value is the minimum non-zero? Or maximum? Or the value from the first row of the group that has a non-zero in that column. For column0, first row has2, so output is2. Column1: first non-zero in column1 is row1's4, but output is2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe it's not per column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each group of three rows is transformed into three output rows where each of the three segments (0-2,4-6,8-10) are filled with the same value. The value is determined by the first non-zero in the corresponding segment across all three rows. For example, in Example0's first group's segment0-2:\n\nLooking at all three rows' segments0-2:\n\nRow0:2,0,0\n\nRow1:0,4,3\n\nRow2:6,0,0\n\nThe first non-zero in this entire segment when read row-wise is2. So the entire segment in the output becomes2.\n\nFor segment4-6 in the same group:\n\nRow0:0,6,2\n\nRow1:4,0,8\n\nRow2:3,0,0\n\nThe first non-zero in this entire segment would be row0's6 (col5). So why is the output segment4-6 all zeros? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the first non-zero in the entire segment (across all three rows and columns) is considered. Let's list all elements in order:\n\nRow0, col4:0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow0, col5:6 \u2192 yes. So first non-zero is6. So the output segment4-6 would be6. But the output is0. So this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the segments in the output are the first non-zero in the corresponding output segment. Wait, perhaps the output is divided into three parts (before 5, between 5s, after 5s). Each part is three elements. For each part in the input group, the value is the first non-zero in the corresponding part of the input group, but considering only the middle row of the group.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let's take a step back.\n\nLooking at the output structure for each group of three rows: each group in the output has three rows where each of the three-element segments (like 0-2, 4-6, 8-10) are filled with the same value. The 5s are fixed.\n\nSo for the first group in Example0's output, the first segment (0-2) is filled with2, the middle segment (4-6) is filled with0, and the last segment (8-10) is filled with0. So how are these values determined from the input?\n\nLooking at the input group for Example0's first three rows:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0,5,0,6,2,5,0,0,4]\n\nRow1: [0,4,3,5,4,0,8,5,3,0,6]\n\nRow2: [6,0,0,5,3,0,0,5,8,0,2]\n\nSegments:\n\nFirst segment (0-2) across all three rows: 2,0,0; 0,4,3;6,0,0.\n\nMiddle segment (4-6) across all three rows:0,6,2;4,0,8;3,0,0.\n\nLast segment (8-10):0,0,4;3,0,6;8,0,2.\n\nIn the output, the first segment is 2,2,2. So maybe the first non-zero in the first segment of any row in the input group. For example, the first row's first element is2. So that's picked. Then the entire segment is set to2.\n\nFor the middle segment (4-6) in the output, it's all0. But looking at the input's middle segments, the first non-zero in each row's middle segment:\n\nRow0's middle segment:0,6,2. The first non-zero is6 (position5).\n\nRow1's middle segment:4,0,8 \u2192 first non-zero4 (position4).\n\nRow2's middle segment:3,0,0 \u2192 first non-zero3 (position4).\n\nSo why is the output for this segment 0? That's confusing. Maybe it's the sum of the first non-zero elements. Or perhaps the sum of all non-zero elements in the segment. But 6+4+3=13, which isn't zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's segment value is the first non-zero in the entire group's middle segment when read in a specific order (e.g., row0's segment, then row1's, then row2's). So for the middle segment:\n\nFirst non-zero is in row0's position5 (6), then row1's position4 (4), then row2's position4 (3). But how does that lead to0 in the output?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's segment values are determined by the first row of the group's segment. For example, if the first row's segment has a non-zero value, use that. If it's zero, check the next row. So for the first group's middle segment in input:\n\nRow0's middle segment is0,6,2. The first non-zero in this row's segment is6. So the output's middle segment would be6,6,6. But in the output, it's0,0,0. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output, the middle segment (4-6) is0. But the input's first row's middle segment starts with0,6,2. So maybe if the first element of the segment in any row is zero, then the entire segment is zero. That seems unlikely. Or perhaps if the first element of the first row's segment is zero, then the segment is set to zero. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0's first group, row0's middle segment starts with0. So output middle segment is0. But in Example0's second group (rows4-6?), let's look. Wait, in Example0's output, the next group after the first 5s is three rows where the middle segment is4,4,4. Let's check their input. Input rows4-6:\n\nRow4: [3,8,0,5,6,2,0,5,0,4,8]\n\nRow5: [0,0,4,5,0,0,4,5,6,0,0]\n\nRow6: [6,2,0,5,3,8,0,5,0,3,2]\n\nMiddle segments (4-6):\n\nRow4:6,2,0 \u2192 first non-zero6.\n\nRow5:0,0,4 \u2192 first non-zero4 (position6).\n\nRow6:3,8,0 \u2192 first non-zero3.\n\nBut the output's middle segment is4,4,4. So how?\n\nHmm, maybe the output's segment value is the first non-zero in the entire group's middle segment when read from the first row's first element, then second row's first element, etc. So for the first group's middle segment (rows0-2, columns4-6):\n\nRow0:0 (col4), then row1's col4 is4, then row2's col4 is3. The first non-zero in col4 is0 (row0), then4 (row1). So the first non-zero in col4 across the three rows is4. So the entire segment is4? But in the output, it's0. That's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the first non-zero from each row's segment. For example, for each row in the group, take the first non-zero in their middle segment and sum them. But for the first group:\n\nRow0's middle segment first non-zero is6 (position5).\n\nRow1's is4 (position4).\n\nRow2's is3 (position4).\n\nSum 6+4+3=13. Not matching output.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in all output examples, each group of three rows in the output has the same values. For example, in Example0's first three output rows, all three are identical. So whatever transformation is applied, each group of three input rows is converted into three identical output rows.\n\nAlso, the 5s are fixed at positions3 and7. So in the output, those positions are always5.\n\nSo perhaps for each group of three input rows, the output is three rows where:\n\n- Positions3 and7 are 5.\n\n- For the other segments (0-2,4-6,8-10), each segment is filled with a single value, which is derived from the input group.\n\nThe value for each segment is the first non-zero in that segment across the three input rows, read in a specific order.\n\nLet me check Example0's first group again.\n\nFor segment0-2:\n\nInput values across three rows:\n\nRow0:2,0,0\n\nRow1:0,4,3\n\nRow2:6,0,0\n\nThe first non-zero when scanning the entire segment in row-major order (row0 then row1 then row2, left to right):\n\nFirst element is2 (row0, col0). So the segment is filled with2.\n\nFor segment4-6:\n\nRow0:0,6,2\n\nRow1:4,0,8\n\nRow2:3,0,0\n\nFirst non-zero in row0:0 (col4), then6 (col5). So the first non-zero in the entire segment (assuming we scan row by row, column by column) is6. But the output is0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first non-zero in the entire segment, but considering columns first. For example, column4 across all rows first. So column4:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:4\n\nRow2:3\n\nFirst non-zero is4 (row1). So the value for segment4-6 is4. But output is0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the first non-zero in the entire group's columns. For example, in the first group's segment0-2, the first column (0) has values2,0,6 \u2192 first non-zero is2. Second column (1) has0,4,0 \u2192 first non-zero4. Third column (2) has0,3,0 \u2192 first non-zero3. But the output's segment0-2 is2,2,2, not 2,4,3. So this can't be right.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output's segments are determined by the sum of the non-zero elements in the input group's corresponding segment, modulo some number. But Example0's first segment sum is2 +4 +3 +6 = 15? No, but the output is2. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe each segment in the output is filled with the value of the first non-zero element in the entire input group's corresponding segment. For example, in Example0's first group, segment0-2:\n\nElements are2,0,0,0,4,3,6,0,0. The first non-zero is2. So the segment is filled with2.\n\nFor the middle segment4-6:\n\n0,6,2,4,0,8,3,0,0. The first non-zero is0 (col4 of row0), then 6 (col5 of row0). So first non-zero is6. But the output segment is0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the segments in the output are filled with the first non-zero element in the corresponding segment of the first row of the group. For Example0's first group, row0's segment0-2 is2,0,0. The first non-zero is2 \u2192 filled with2. Middle segment4-6 of row0 is0,6,2 \u2192 first non-zero is6. But output is0. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's look at another example. Example1's input and output.\n\nExample1's input first three rows:\n\nRow0: [2,0,3,5,4,6,0,5,0,6,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,8,5,0,0,2,5,4,0,3]\n\nRow2: [4,6,0,5,3,8,0,5,2,0,8]\n\nOutput first three rows:\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,2,2,2]\n\nAll three rows are the same. Segments0-2 are0,0,0. Middle segments4-6 are0,0,0. Last segments8-10 are2,2,2.\n\nLooking at input group's segments:\n\nSegment0-2:\n\nRow0:2,0,3 \u2192 first non-zero2.\n\nRow1:0,0,8 \u2192 first non-zero8 (col2).\n\nRow2:4,6,0 \u2192 first non-zero4 (col0).\n\nFirst non-zero in the entire segment when read row by row:2. So output segment0-2 is0. Which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output segment is filled with the first non-zero in the entire group's segment, but starting from the last row. For Example0's first group, the segment0-2's first non-zero in row0 is2, but if we start from the last row (row2), the first non-zero is6. But output is2.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe another approach: look at the output's segments and see what's common in the input groups.\n\nFor Example0's first group's output segments:\n\n0-2:2,2,2 \u2192 input group's first non-zero in the first row's first element is2.\n\nMiddle segment4-6:0,0,0 \u2192 the first row's first element of middle segment is0.\n\nLast segment8-10:0,0,0 \u2192 first row's first element of last segment is0.\n\nHmm. So perhaps each segment in the output is filled with the first element of that segment in the first row of the group. If that element is zero, then the entire segment is zero. But that seems arbitrary. Let's check Example0's first group:\n\nFirst row's segment0-2:2,0,0 \u2192 first element2. So output segment is2,2,2.\n\nMiddle segment4-6:0,6,2 \u2192 first element0 \u2192 output segment0,0,0.\n\nLast segment8-10:0,0,4 \u2192 first element0 \u2192 output0,0,0.\n\nBut in Example0's next group (rows4-6):\n\nInput rows4-6 are:\n\nRow4: [3,8,0,5,6,2,0,5,0,4,8]\n\nRow5: [0,0,4,5,0,0,4,5,6,0,0]\n\nRow6: [6,2,0,5,3,8,0,5,0,3,2]\n\nOutput for this group's segments:\n\nSegment0-2:0,0,0. Middle segment4-6:4,4,4. Last segment8-10:3,3,3.\n\nFirst row of this group (row4):\n\nSegment0-2:3,8,0 \u2192 first element3. But output segment0-2 is0. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the output segments are filled with the first non-zero element in the corresponding segment of the middle row of the group. For Example0's first group, the middle row is row1. Segment0-2:0,4,3 \u2192 first non-zero4. But output segment is2. So not matching.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's compare input and output for the same row. For Example0's first input row:\n\nInput: [2,0,0,5,0,6,2,5,0,0,4]\n\nOutput: [2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutput segments0-2:2,2,2. Middle:0,0,0. End:0,0,0.\n\nInput segments0-2:2,0,0. Middle:0,6,2. End:0,0,4.\n\nSo the output's segment0-2 is filled with the first element of the input's segment0-2 (2). The middle segment is filled with0 (the first element of input's middle segment). The end segment is filled with0 (first element of input's end segment).\n\nBut in Example0's row4 input:\n\nInput row4: [3,8,0,5,6,2,0,5,0,4,8]\n\nOutput row4: [0,0,0,5,4,4,4,5,3,3,3]\n\nSegment0-2 in output is0,0,0. Input segment0-2:3,8,0. First element3. But output is0. So this doesn't hold.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output segments are filled with the most common non-zero value in the input group's segment. For Example0's first group's segment0-2:\n\nValues:2,0,0,0,4,3,6,0,0. The non-zero values are2,4,3,6. The most common is not clear. So probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output segments are filled with the sum of the first non-zero from each row's segment. For Example0's first group's segment0-2:\n\nRow0's first non-zero:2.\n\nRow1's:0 (row1's segment0-2:0,4,3. First non-zero4 (col1).\n\nRow2's:6 (col0).\n\nSum:2+4+6=12. Not matching output.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input and expected output. Let's take the test input and see what the expected output would be based on previous examples.\n\nTest input:\n\n[6,4,0,5,0,3,0,5,0,4,0]\n[0,0,3,5,2,8,6,5,8,0,2]\n[2,0,8,5,4,0,0,5,6,3,0]\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n[2,0,0,5,0,3,0,5,3,6,2]\n[3,4,6,5,8,4,2,5,0,0,4]\n[0,8,0,5,0,0,6,5,8,0,0]\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n[0,2,4,5,0,6,4,5,0,2,8]\n[0,6,3,5,0,0,3,5,4,0,6]\n[0,0,0,5,2,0,8,5,3,0,0]\n\nThe output should have groups of three rows each, except the middle row of 5s. Let's process each group.\n\nFirst group (rows0-2):\n\nInput rows0-2:\n\nRow0:6,4,0,5,0,3,0,5,0,4,0\n\nRow1:0,0,3,5,2,8,6,5,8,0,2\n\nRow2:2,0,8,5,4,0,0,5,6,3,0\n\nProcessing this group, the output will have three rows with segments filled based on some pattern. The middle row of 5s is row3, which stays as is.\n\nLooking at previous examples, for each group of three input rows, the output group's segments are determined by the first non-zero element in a certain way.\n\nIn Example0's first group, the first segment of the output is filled with2, which is the first element of the first row's segment. But in Example0's case, the first row's segment0-2 starts with2. But in the test input's first row's segment0-2 is6,4,0. So perhaps the output's first segment would be6,6,6.\n\nBut according to the examples, when the first row's segment starts with a non-zero, the entire segment is filled with that value. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's first group, first row's segment0-2 starts with2 (non-zero), so output segment0-2 is2.\n\nIn Example1's first group, first row's segment0-2 starts with2, but output segment0-2 is0. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. Maybe the value is the first non-zero in the entire group's segment, scanning row by row, left to right. For example, in the test input's first group's segment0-2:\n\nRow0:6,4,0\n\nRow1:0,0,3\n\nRow2:2,0,8\n\nScanning in order:6 (row0, col0), then4 (row0, col1), then0, then row1's col0 (0), etc. The first non-zero is6. So the entire segment0-2 in the output would be6,6,6.\n\nFor the middle segment4-6:\n\nRow0:0,3,0\n\nRow1:2,8,6\n\nRow2:4,0,0\n\nFirst non-zero in row0's middle segment is0 (col4), then3 (col5). Row1's middle segment starts with2 (col4). So the first non-zero in the entire group's middle segment is2. So the middle segment would be2,2,2.\n\nFor the last segment8-10:\n\nRow0:0,4,0 \u2192 first non-zero is4 (col9).\n\nRow1:8,0,2 \u2192 first non-zero8 (col8).\n\nRow2:6,3,0 \u2192 first non-zero6 (col8).\n\nThe first non-zero in the entire segment (row0's col8 is0, row0 col9:4. Then row1's col8:8. So the first non-zero is4 (row0, col9) \u2192 which is part of the segment8-10. Wait, the segment8-10 includes columns8,9,10. So in row0's segment8-10:0,4,0 \u2192 first non-zero is4 (col9). So the entire segment8-10 would be filled with4.\n\nBut looking at the previous examples, sometimes the last segment's value is determined by the first non-zero in the entire group's segment. For example, in Example0's first group's segment8-10:\n\nRow0:0,0,4\n\nRow1:3,0,6\n\nRow2:8,0,2\n\nThe first non-zero in the segment8-10 is row0's col10:4. But the output's segment is0. So that theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last segment's value is determined by the first non-zero in the third row's segment. For Example0's first group's last segment, row2's segment8-10 is8,0,2. First non-zero8. But output's segment is0. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the output segments in all examples, it seems that each segment is filled with a single digit, and the digits are either 0,2,3,4,6. The 5s are fixed.\n\nAnother observation: in the output, the three segments (0-2,4-6,8-10) are all filled with the same value across all three rows of the group. So for each group, there are three values: one for each segment.\n\nIn Example0's first group:\n\nSegments0-2:2,2,2 \u2192 value2\n\nSegments4-6:0,0,0 \u2192 value0\n\nSegments8-10:0,0,0 \u2192 value0\n\nIn Example0's second group (rows4-6):\n\nSegments0-2:0,0,0 \u2192 value0\n\nSegments4-6:4,4,4 \u2192 value4\n\nSegments8-10:3,3,3 \u2192 value3\n\nThird group (rows8-10):\n\nSegments0-2:6,6,6 \u2192 value6\n\nSegments4-6:0,0,0 \u2192 value0\n\nSegments8-10:0,0,0 \u2192 value0\n\nNow, looking at the input groups:\n\nFirst group's rows0-2:\n\nRows0-2 in input:\n\nRow0: [2,0,0,5,0,6,2,5,0,0,4]\n\nRow1: [0,4,3,5,4,0,8,5,3,0,6]\n\nRow2: [6,0,0,5,3,0,0,5,8,0,2]\n\nOutput for first group: segments filled with2,0,0.\n\nHmm. How are these values determined?\n\nAnother idea: the value for each segment in the output is the sum of the first non-zero element from each row in the corresponding segment of the input group.\n\nFor example, in the first group's segment0-2:\n\nRow0's first non-zero:2\n\nRow1's first non-zero:4 (col1)\n\nRow2's first non-zero:6 (col0)\n\nSum:2+4+6=12. But output is2. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product of the first non-zero elements. 2*4*6=48. Also not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the value is the first non-zero element from the first row's segment. For example, first row's segment0-2 has first non-zero2. So output is2. Middle segment first non-zero0 (row0's segment4-6 starts with0). So output0. Last segment first non-zero0 (row0's segment8-10 starts with0). So output0. That matches Example0's first group.\n\nBut let's check Example0's second group (rows4-6):\n\nRow4: [3,8,0,5,6,2,0,5,0,4,8]\n\nRow5: [0,0,4,5,0,0,4,5,6,0,0]\n\nRow6: [6,2,0,5,3,8,0,5,0,3,2]\n\nOutput for this group's segments:\n\nSegment0-2:0,0,0 \u2192 first row's segment0-2 is3,8,0. First non-zero3. But output is0. So this theory is invalid.\n\nHmm. This is really tricky. Let's think differently. Maybe the output is generated by replacing each group of three rows with three copies of a certain row, modified to have the segments filled with the first non-zero in each segment of the first row of the group.\n\nFor example, in Example0's first group:\n\nRow0's segment0-2 has first non-zero2 \u2192 filled with2.\n\nRow0's segment4-6 has first non-zero0 \u2192 filled with0.\n\nRow0's segment8-10 has first non-zero0 \u2192 filled with0.\n\nThen, output group is three copies of this modified row. This would explain Example0's first group. Let's test this theory.\n\nExample1's first group input row0: [2,0,3,5,4,6,0,5,0,6,0]\n\nRow0's segments:\n\n0-2:2,0,3 \u2192 first non-zero2.\n\n4-6:4,6,0 \u2192 first non-zero4.\n\n8-10:0,6,0 \u2192 first non-zero6.\n\nSo output segments would be2,4,6. But the output segments are0,0,2. So this theory doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output segments are filled with the first non-zero value found when scanning the entire group's segments in a particular order, perhaps column-wise.\n\nFor example, for segment0-2 of the first group:\n\nColumns0 across the three input rows are2,0,6. The first non-zero is2. So segment0-2's first element is2.\n\nColumn1 across the three rows:0,4,0 \u2192 first non-zero4.\n\nColumn2:0,3,0 \u2192 first non-zero3.\n\nSo the segment0-2 would be2,4,3. But output is2,2,2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the segment is filled with the value from the first column's first non-zero. So for segment0-2, the first column's first non-zero is2. So the entire segment is filled with2. Then, for the segment4-6, first column (col4) across three rows is0,4,3 \u2192 first non-zero4. So the segment is filled with4. But in Example0's first group output, the middle segment is0. So this doesn't match.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's look at another example. Example2's first group input:\n\n[0,3,0,5,0,6,3,5,0,6,2]\n\n[6,0,4,5,2,8,0,5,0,0,8]\n\n[0,2,8,5,0,4,0,5,3,0,4]\n\nOutput first group:\n\n[0,0,0,5,3,3,3,5,0,0,0]\n\nSegments0-2:0,0,0 \u2192 0.\n\nSegments4-6:3,3,3 \u21923.\n\nSegments8-10:0,0,0 \u21920.\n\nLooking at the input group's first row's segments:\n\n0-2:0,3,0 \u2192 first non-zero3.\n\n4-6:0,6,3 \u2192 first non-zero0, then6.\n\n8-10:0,6,2 \u2192 first non-zero0, then6.\n\nBut output is0,3,0. So perhaps the first non-zero in the entire group's segment is taken from the first row's first element. If it's zero, then check the next row's first element of the segment.\n\nFor segment0-2:\n\nRow0's first element is0. Row1's first element is6. Row2's first element is0. So first non-zero is6. But output segment0-2 is0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the segments are filled based on the sum of the first non-zero elements of each row in the segment.\n\nFor Example2's first group:\n\nSegment0-2:\n\nRow0:0,3,0 \u2192 first non-zero3.\n\nRow1:6,0,4 \u2192 first non-zero6.\n\nRow2:0,2,8 \u2192 first non-zero2.\n\nSum:3+6+2=11. Not matching output0.\n\nAnother possibility: the value is the minimum non-zero value in the segment. For Example2's first group's segment0-2: min(3,6,2)=2. Output is0. No.\n\nAlternatively, the value is the maximum non-zero value. Max(3,6,2)=6. Output0. No.\n\nHmm. Let's try to look for a different pattern. The output segments seem to have numbers that appear in the input group's segments, but not sure how. For example, in Example0's first group's segment0-2 output is2, which is present in row0. The middle segment output is0, which is the first element of row0's middle segment. Last segment output0, which is the first element of row0's last segment.\n\nIn Example0's second group's segment4-6 output is4. Looking at the input group's rows4-6:\n\nRow4:3,8,0,5,6,2,0,5,0,4,8 \u2192 middle segment6,2,0 \u2192 first element6.\n\nRow5:0,0,4,5,0,0,4,5,6,0,0 \u2192 middle segment0,0,4 \u2192 first element0.\n\nRow6:6,2,0,5,3,8,0,5,0,3,2 \u2192 middle segment3,8,0 \u2192 first element3.\n\nOutput's middle segment is4. So where does4 come from? Maybe the first non-zero in the middle segments across the three rows. But row4's middle starts with6, row5's with0, row6's with3. So the first non-zero is6. But output is4. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is the first non-zero in the middle row of the group. For Example0's second group (rows4-6), the middle row is row5. Middle segment of row5 is0,0,4. First non-zero4. So output segment4-6 is4. This matches! Then, the first row of the group's segment is row4:6,2,0. First non-zero6. But output is0. So that's not.\n\nBut in Example0's second group's middle segment output is4. The middle row of the group is row5. Middle segment of row5 is0,0,4. So first non-zero in row5's middle segment is4 (col6). So output is4. This fits. Similarly, segment0-2 of the group's middle row (row5) is0,0,4. First non-zero4. But output's segment0-2 is0. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nBut in Example0's second group, the output's segment4-6 is4. Which matches the middle row's (row5) first non-zero in that segment's column4:0. Wait, no. So this isn't right.\n\nPerhaps the value is determined by the middle row of the group. For Example0's second group, the middle row is row5. For segment4-6 in row5:0,0,4. First non-zero in this row's segment is4. So output's segment4-6 is4. Which matches. For segment0-2 of row5:0,0,4. First non-zero is4. But output's segment0-2 is0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very challenging. Another idea: the output's segments are filled with the value from the corresponding segment of the middle row of the input group. For Example0's first group, the middle row is row1. segment0-2 of row1 is0,4,3. First non-zero4. But output's segment0-2 is2. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's segments are filled with the value from the corresponding segment of the first row of the next group. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and not finding the pattern, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the examples, the output groups of three rows have their segments filled with a single value. The value seems to be the first non-zero in the entire group's segment when scanning left to right, row by row.\n\nFor Example0's first group's segment0-2:\n\nRows0-2, columns0-2: 2,0,0;0,4,3;6,0,0.\n\nScanning row0 first: elements2,0,0. The first non-zero is2. So the entire segment is filled with2.\n\nMiddle segment4-6:\n\nRow0:0,6,2 \u2192 first non-zero is0 (col4), then6 (col5). So the first non-zero is6. But the output is0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the first non-zero in the entire group's segment, but only considering the first element of each row's segment. For example, for segment4-6:\n\nRow0's first element (col4):0\n\nRow1's col4:4\n\nRow2's col4:3\n\nFirst non-zero is4. So the entire segment is4. But output is0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the first non-zero in the entire group's segment, but starting from the bottom row. For Example0's first group's segment0-2:\n\nRow2's elements6,0,0 \u2192 first non-zero6. So segment becomes6. But output is2. So no.\n\nI'm really stuck. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make a guess based on the observation that the output segments are filled with the first non-zero in the corresponding segment of the first row of the group, and if it's zero, then the segment is zero. But this doesn't hold for all examples, but it's a possible pattern.\n\nFor the test input's first group:\n\nRow0's segments:\n\n0-2:6,4,0 \u2192 first non-zero6. So output segment0-2 is6.\n\nSegment4-6:0,3,0 \u2192 first non-zero3 (col5). So output segment4-6 is3.\n\nSegment8-10:0,4,0 \u2192 first non-zero4 (col9). So output segment8-10 is4.\n\nBut looking at previous examples, this doesn't hold. For instance, Example0's first group's segment4-6 in row0 is0,6,2 \u2192 first non-zero6. But output segment is0. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the output's segments are filled with the first non-zero in the first row's segment, but only if it's the first element. For Example0's first row's segment4-6 starts with0, so output is0. If the first element is non-zero, then the segment is filled with that value.\n\nSo for the test input's first group:\n\nRow0's segment0-2 starts with6 \u2192 output6,6,6.\n\nSegment4-6 starts with0 \u2192 output0,0,0.\n\nSegment8-10 starts with0 \u2192 output0,0,0.\n\nBut looking at Example0's second group:\n\nRow4's segment0-2 starts with3 \u2192 output's segment0-2 is0. So this theory is invalid.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following pattern assumption:\n\nEach group of three input rows is transformed into three output rows where:\n\n- The segments0-2,4-6,8-10 are filled with the first non-zero value in the corresponding segment of the entire group when scanned row by row, left to right. If all are zero, then zero.\n\nFor the test input's first group:\n\nSegment0-2:\n\nLooking for first non-zero in rows0-2, columns0-2.\n\nRow0:6,4,0 \u2192 first non-zero6.\n\nRow1:0,0,3 \u2192 first non-zero3.\n\nRow2:2,0,8 \u2192 first non-zero2.\n\nThe first non-zero in the entire segment when scanned row by row, left to right is6 (row0, col0). So segment0-2 is6,6,6.\n\nSegment4-6:\n\nRow0:0,3,0 \u2192 first non-zero3 (row0, col5).\n\nRow1:2,8,6 \u2192 first non-zero2 (row1, col4).\n\nRow2:4,0,0 \u2192 first non-zero4 (row2, col4).\n\nThe first non-zero in order is3. So segment4-6 is3,3,3.\n\nSegment8-10:\n\nRow0:0,4,0 \u2192 first non-zero4 (row0, col9).\n\nRow1:8,0,2 \u2192 first non-zero8 (row1, col8).\n\nRow2:6,3,0 \u2192 first non-zero6 (row2, col8).\n\nThe first non-zero in order is4 (row0, col9). So segment8-10 is4,4,4.\n\nThus, the output for the first three rows would be:\n\n[6,6,6,5,3,3,3,5,4,4,4] repeated three times.\n\nBut looking at the examples, each group's three output rows are identical. So the three rows would be the same.\n\nNext group in the test input is rows4-6:\n\nInput rows4-6:\n\nRow4:2,0,0,5,0,3,0,5,3,6,2\n\nRow5:3,4,6,5,8,4,2,5,0,0,4\n\nRow6:0,8,0,5,0,0,6,5,8,0,0\n\nProcessing their segments:\n\nSegment0-2:\n\nRow4:2,0,0 \u2192 first non-zero2.\n\nRow5:3,4,6 \u2192 first non-zero3.\n\nRow6:0,8,0 \u2192 first non-zero8.\n\nFirst non-zero in order is2. So segment0-2 is2,2,2.\n\nSegment4-6:\n\nRow4:0,3,0 \u2192 first non-zero3 (row4, col5).\n\nRow5:8,4,2 \u2192 first non-zero8 (row5, col4).\n\nRow6:0,0,6 \u2192 first non-zero6 (row6, col6).\n\nFirst non-zero in order is3. So segment4-6 is3,3,3.\n\nSegment8-10:\n\nRow4:3,6,2 \u2192 first non-zero3.\n\nRow5:0,0,4 \u2192 first non-zero4 (row5, col10).\n\nRow6:8,0,0 \u2192 first non-zero8.\n\nFirst non-zero in order is3. So segment8-10 is3,3,3.\n\nThus, the output for rows4-6 would be [2,2,2,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3] three times.\n\nThird group is rows8-10:\n\nInput rows8-10:\n\nRow8:0,2,4,5,0,6,4,5,0,2,8\n\nRow9:0,6,3,5,0,0,3,5,4,0,6\n\nRow10:0,0,0,5,2,0,8,5,3,0,0\n\nSegments:\n\nSegment0-2:\n\nRow8:0,2,4 \u2192 first non-zero2 (row8, col1).\n\nRow9:0,6,3 \u2192 first non-zero6 (row9, col1).\n\nRow10:0,0,0 \u2192 all zeros. First non-zero is none, so 0.\n\nFirst non-zero in order is2. So segment0-2 is2,2,2.\n\nSegment4-6:\n\nRow8:0,6,4 \u2192 first non-zero6 (row8, col5).\n\nRow9:0,0,3 \u2192 first non-zero3 (row9, col6).\n\nRow10:2,0,8 \u2192 first non-zero2 (row10, col4).\n\nFirst non-zero in order is6. So segment4-6 is6,6,6.\n\nSegment8-10:\n\nRow8:0,2,8 \u2192 first non-zero2 (row8, col9).\n\nRow9:4,0,6 \u2192 first non-zero4 (row9, col8).\n\nRow10:3,0,0 \u2192 first non-zero3 (row10, col8).\n\nFirst non-zero in order is2. So segment8-10 is2,2,2.\n\nThus, the output for rows8-10 would be [2,2,2,5,6,6,6,5,2,2,2] three times.\n\nPutting it all together, the output should be:\n\n[6,6,6,5,3,3,3,5,4,4,4]\n\n[6,6,6,5,3,3,3,5,4,4,4]\n\n[6,6,6,5,3,3,3,5,4,4,4]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[2,2,2,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3]\n\n[2,2,2,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3]\n\n[2,2,2,5,3,3,3,5,3,3,3]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[2,2,2,5,6,6,6,5,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,5,6,6,6,5,2,2,2]\n\n[2,2,2,5,6,6,6,5,2,2,2]\n\nBut looking at the previous examples, sometimes the middle segment can't have higher values than others. For example, in Example0's first group, the middle segment is0. But this approach may not fit all examples. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this as the answer.",
