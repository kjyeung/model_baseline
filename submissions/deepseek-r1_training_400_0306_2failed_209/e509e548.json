        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to transform the input lists (which are all lists of integers, mostly 0s and 3s) into output lists where some of the 3s are replaced with other numbers like 1, 2, 6, etc. Let's look at the training examples to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a lot of 3s arranged in certain patterns. The output replaces some 3s with 1, 2, or 6. Let me check where those replacements happen. For instance, in the first few rows of the input, there's a 3 in the 17th and 18th positions (0-indexed?), and the output replaces them with 1s. Then there's a row where the input has [3, 3, 3, 3] and the output is [2, 2, 2, 2]. Another row in the input has three 3s, which become 6, 6, 6. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the position of the 3s. Let me check if the replacement numbers depend on their location. Like, perhaps certain regions of the grid correspond to different numbers. For example, top-left might be 1, middle regions 2, and bottom-right 6? Or maybe it's based on the number of adjacent 3s. Or maybe it's something else like the count of 3s in the row or column.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The first row is [3,3,3,0...] which becomes [1,1,1,0...]. Then in another part, there's a row in the input with [3,3,3,3,3] which becomes [2,2,2,2,2]. So the same 3s in different positions are mapped to different numbers. So maybe the output numbers are determined by some kind of grouping or regions. Like, each contiguous block of 3s is assigned a number. But why 1, 2, 6?\n\nWait, maybe the numbers 1, 2, 6 are related to the positions of the 3s modulo some number. Or perhaps they represent different colors or layers. Alternatively, maybe the output numbers are determined by the number of adjacent 3s. Let's check.\n\nTake the first example's input. The row with [3,3,3,3] in the input becomes [2,2,2,2]. In another row, a single 3 becomes 2. Wait, maybe the number 2 is used when the 3 is part of a horizontal line, 1 when vertical, and 6 when diagonal? Or perhaps it's based on the direction of the group. Alternatively, maybe the output numbers are assigned based on the number of 3s in their surrounding cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is encoding the number of live neighbors in a cellular automaton-like rule, but the numbers don't seem to directly correspond. For instance, in Example 0's output, some 3s are replaced with 6. 6 is a higher number, maybe indicating more neighbors.\n\nWait, let's take a specific example. In Example 0's input, the fifth row is [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, ...], and the output is [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, ...]. So a single 3 becomes 2. But in another row, three 3s in a row become 6s. Wait, maybe it's the sum of the 3s in a certain way. But 3*2=6. Wait, 3 is replaced by 1, 2, or 6. Hmm. So 1, 2, 6 are all multiples of 1, 2, 3, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe 1, 2, 6 are different regions, like quadrants. For example, in the first training example, the upper part uses 1 and 2, while the lower part uses 6. Maybe the grid is divided into regions, and each region's 3s are mapped to a different number.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the first few rows have 1s, then some have 2s, and others have 6s. Let me see where these are. The first three rows of the output have 1s in the rightmost part. Then in the fourth row, the 3s become 2s. Then in the fifth row, three 3s become 6s. Then lower down, there are 6s again. Hmm. Maybe it's about the vertical position. For instance, if the 3 is in the upper part of the grid, it's mapped to 1 or 2, and lower parts to 6. Or perhaps the grid is split into sections, and each section has a different replacement number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement numbers are based on the row index. For example, rows 0-5 use 1 and 2, rows below use 6. But looking at Example 1's output, the first row is 1s, then some 6s, and later rows have 2s. So maybe it's not the row index.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the output numbers. Let's take Example 0's input and output. Let's look for a 3 in the input and see what it becomes in the output. For example, in the 13th input row (0-based?), the input is [3,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0...] and the output is [2,2,2,2,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0...]. So here, the first four 3s become 2, and the next five 3s become 1. So the same row has 3s mapped to different numbers. So it's not based on the row. What's different between those groups? The position in the row. The first group is at the start, the second group is after some zeros. Maybe the horizontal position? Like, left side is 2, right side is 1. But then in the same example, another row has 3s in the middle mapped to 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 3s in the group. For example, a group of three 3s becomes 6 (since 3*2=6?), a single 3 becomes 2, and a group of two becomes 1. Wait, in Example 0's first input row, two 3s become 1s. Then a single 3 becomes 2. Then a group of four 3s becomes 2s, which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement number is determined by the number of adjacent 3s. For example, each 3 is replaced by the count of its neighbors (including diagonally?) multiplied by some factor. But in Example 0, the first row has two adjacent 3s, which become 1 each. If it's the count of adjacent 3s, maybe each 3 is replaced by the count. Let's check. The first row's two 3s are adjacent. Each would have one neighbor. So 1+1=2, but they are replaced by 1s. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the 3's own value (3) divided by 3 and multiplied by something. Like 3 becomes 1 (3/3=1), but then other examples have 3 becoming 2 or 6, which would require 3/3*2=2, 3/3*6=6. So maybe it's a multiplier based on some condition. So 3 is divided by 3 (to get 1) and then multiplied by a factor depending on location. So if the 3 is in a certain area, multiply by 1, 2, or 6.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The first row is three 3s, which become 1s. Then in another row, five 3s become 2s. Then in the same example, another row has three 3s becoming 6s. Wait, maybe the replacement number depends on which \"block\" or region the 3 is in. For instance, in Example 1, the 3s in the upper part are replaced with 1s, the middle with 6s, and the lower part with 2s. So maybe different regions have different multipliers.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The first few rows have 3s replaced by 6, then later by 1, 2, etc. For example, the second input row has a 3 which becomes 6, and in the same row another 3 becomes 1. So different regions again.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the output numbers (1, 2, 6) are related to the number of 3s in their respective regions. For example, regions with 1 3 become 1, regions with 2 3s become 2, regions with 3 3s become 6 (since 3*2=6). But in Example 0, there's a group of four 3s becoming 2s. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement numbers are determined by the parity of the row and column. For instance, even rows and columns get 1, odd get 2, but that doesn't explain the 6s.\n\nWait, let's think of the output numbers as possibly being color codes. Maybe the input 3s are colored based on their position. For example, if a 3 is in a vertical line, it's 1; horizontal line, 2; and diagonal or corner, 6. Let's check Example 0. In the first output example, there's a vertical line of 1s. The input has two 3s vertically aligned. Then, there's a horizontal line of 2s. So maybe vertical 3s become 1, horizontal 2, and other patterns like corners or L-shapes become 6.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input row 4: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, ...] becomes [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0...]. So a horizontal line of four 3s becomes 2s. Then row 7 in the input has [3,3,3] which becomes [6,6,6]. Wait, but in row 7, the input is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So those three 3s are in a horizontal line but are replaced by 6. Hmm, that doesn't fit the previous idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number is determined by the position of the 3 in the grid. For example, if the 3 is in the top-left quadrant, it's 1; top-right, 2; bottom-left, 6; etc. But looking at the examples, the positions vary.\n\nAnother angle: The output numbers could be the count of the 3's connected components in a certain way. Like, each contiguous block of 3s is assigned a unique number. But in Example 0's output, some contiguous blocks are 2s and others are 6s. So that might not be it. Unless the numbers are assigned based on the size of the component. But in Example 0, a group of four 3s becomes 2s, while a group of three 3s becomes 6s. So the size doesn't directly map to the number.\n\nWait, maybe the number is determined by the sum of the coordinates. For example, if the row + column is even, 1; if odd, 2. But that doesn't explain the 6s.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement numbers are 1, 2, 6, which are 1, 2, 3 multiplied by some factor. But 1, 2, 6 are 1, 2, 3*2. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output again. The 2s are often in the left part of the grid, and the 6s in the right. For instance, in the 4th input row, the left 3s become 2s, and the 3s in the right (positions 12-14) become 6s. So maybe the grid is split vertically. Let me check the vertical position. For example, if a 3 is in the left half of the grid, it's replaced with 2; in the right half, 6; and maybe top or bottom parts with 1. But in Example 1, the first row's 3s are on the left, but they become 1s. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the parity of the column. For instance, even columns become 2, odd columns become 6, but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the first row is [3,3,3,0...], which becomes [1,1,1,0...]. These 3s are in columns 0,1,2. The output is 1. Then, in another part of the input, there's a vertical line of 3s in columns 2, which become 6s. Maybe columns on the left (like 0-2) are 1, middle 3-5: 2, right 6+? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see the possible output numbers. The outputs use 1, 2, 6. What's special about these numbers? 1 and 2 are factors of 6. Maybe 6 is used when the 3 is part of both horizontal and vertical lines? Or maybe 6 is the sum of 1 and 2 multiplied by 2.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers 1, 2, 6 could represent different layers or directions. For example, 1 for vertical lines, 2 for horizontal, 6 for diagonal. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row, two 3s are adjacent horizontally (positions 17 and 18?), and they become 1s. Wait, but horizontal would be 2. So that contradicts. But in the fourth row of input in Example 0, four horizontal 3s become 2s, which fits. Then, in the same example, some vertical lines of 3s become 1s. For example, in the 13th input row, there's a vertical line of 3s (columns 0-4?), but the output is [2,2,2,2,0,0,1,1...]. So the first four 3s become 2s, which are horizontal. Then the next five 3s (columns 6-10) are horizontal as well, but they become 1s. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the orientation of the group. For example, a horizontal group becomes 2, vertical becomes 1, and other shapes (like L, T, etc.) become 6. Let's test this. In Example 0's row 4, horizontal 3s \u2192 2. In row 13, the first group is horizontal, becomes 2. The next group is a horizontal line (positions 6-10?), becomes 1. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the length of the group. For example, groups of length 1 become 2, groups of length 2 become 1, groups of length 3 become 6. But in Example 0's row 4, a group of 4 becomes 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The numbers 1, 2, 6 could be related to the number of 3s in the same row or column. For instance, if a row has three 3s, they become 6. But in Example 0, row 4 has four 3s becoming 2s. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of 3s in a particular direction. For example, for each 3, sum the adjacent 3s above, below, left, right. But in Example 0, a single 3 in a row becomes 2. If that 3 has no adjacent 3s, the sum is zero. So 3 becomes 2, which doesn't align.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's look for another pattern. The input has 0s and 3s. The output has 0s and 1, 2, 6. So each 3 is replaced by one of these numbers. The key is to determine under what condition a 3 becomes 1, 2, or 6.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output again:\n\nIn the 13th input row (0-based?), the input is [3,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0, ...], output is [2,2,2,2,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0...]. So the first four 3s are replaced by 2s, then after two zeros, five 3s become 1s. So the same row has different replacements. What's different between these groups? The position. The first group is in the first four positions, the next group starts at position 6. Maybe the first group is in the left part of the grid, the second in the right. So perhaps the grid is divided into left and right, with left 3s becoming 2s and right 3s becoming 1s. But then why in other examples, like Example 1, the left 3s become 1s. So maybe the division is based on columns. Let's check the columns for Example 0.\n\nFor Example 0's 13th input row, the first group is columns 0-3 (assuming 0-based), which becomes 2s. Then the next group starts at column 6. If the grid is split into left (columns 0-10) and right (11-20), but that's arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe the grid is split into vertical thirds. Left third (columns 0-6), middle (7-13), right (14-20). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the left half of the grid's 3s become 2s, the right half become 1s, and other areas like the bottom become 6s. But this doesn't explain all cases.\n\nWait, let's look at the test input provided. The test input has several 3s arranged in certain patterns. Let's try to see if applying a certain pattern would work.\n\nThe test input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: [0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow 9: All zeros.\n\nRow 10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 11: [0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0]\n\nRow 13: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nAssuming that in the output, certain 3s become 1, others 2, others 6. Let's try to see where they might go.\n\nLooking at Example 0, 3s in certain positions became 1, 2, or 6. For example, in the first row of Example 0's input, the two 3s are in the 17th and 18th positions (0-based) and became 1s. In Example 0's output, the 6s appear in the middle-right part of the grid.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's 6s are in the middle-right part of the input. The 1s are in the top-left, and the 2s in the lower part.\n\nSo maybe 1s are for vertical lines, 2s for horizontal, and 6s for diagonal or other orientations. Let's check the test input.\n\nFor example, in row 2 of the test input, there's a group of three 3s (columns 1-3) and another group of three 3s (columns 12-14). If the first group is horizontal (columns 1-3), maybe they become 2s. The second group (columns 12-14) might be in a different region and become 6s. But then in row 0, there are two isolated 3s (positions 1 and 3). If they're in a region that maps to 2, they would become 2s.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that each 3 is replaced by 1 if it's part of a vertical line, 2 if part of a horizontal line, and 6 if part of a diagonal line or other configuration. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 4: four horizontal 3s \u2192 2s. That fits. Then, in the same example, a vertical line of three 3s becomes 1s. In the 13th input row, a horizontal line of five 3s becomes 1s. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Why are those horizontal 3s replaced with 1s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the orientation is relative to the entire grid. Like, vertical lines in the top part, horizontal in the middle, and others elsewhere. This is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement numbers could be based on the number of 3s in the row and column. For example, for each 3, count how many 3s are in its row and column and use that to determine the replacement. But this might not explain the outputs.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input. The first row is three 3s horizontally, which become 1s. Then there's a row with five 3s in a horizontal line (input row 6) which becomes 2s. So horizontal lines are sometimes 1s and sometimes 2s. That contradicts the previous idea.\n\nAnother angle: Let's think of the output numbers as the count of 3s in the row or column. For instance, if a row has three 3s, replace each with 3/3* something. But in Example 0, a row with four 3s becomes 2s. 4/3 is not 2.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the number of times the 3 appears in its row or column. For example, if a 3 is the only one in its row, it becomes 1. If there are two, becomes 2, etc. But in Example 0, the first input row has two 3s, which become 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try to find another pattern. The output numbers 1, 2, 6. 1 + 2 = 3, and 6 is 3*2. Maybe the replacement is based on the sum of the adjacent 3s multiplied by a certain factor. For example, if a 3 has two neighbors (left and right in a horizontal line), then 3 becomes 2 (sum 2), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output numbers are the count of the 3's connected components. For example, each contiguous block of 3s is assigned a unique number, but in Example 0, there are multiple blocks assigned 1, 2, or 6. So that's not it.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe 1s are mostly in the right part, 2s in the left part, and 6s in the middle-right. Maybe the grid is divided into three regions:\n\n- Left region: 3s become 2\n\n- Middle-right: 3s become 6\n\n- Far right: 3s become 1\n\nBut how to define the boundaries. For example, in Example 0's 13th row, the first four 3s are in columns 0-3 (left), which become 2s. Then after some zeros, columns 6-10 (middle) become 1s. But then in other parts, like row 4, columns 12-14 (right) become 6s. This is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement numbers are determined by the column index. Let's look at the columns where 3s become 1, 2, or 6.\n\nExample 0's first row:\n\nInput 3s at columns 17 and 18 (assuming 0-based). Output 1s. So columns 17-18 \u2192 1.\n\nExample 0's fourth row:\n\nInput 3s at columns 3-6 (assuming) become 2s.\n\nAnother row: 3s in columns 12-14 become 6.\n\nSo perhaps columns 0-9 are 2, 10-15 are 6, 16+ are 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the columns are grouped into thirds. For a 21-column grid (as in Example 0):\n\nThird 1: 0-6 \u2192 2\n\nThird 2: 7-13 \u2192 6\n\nThird 3: 14-20 \u2192 1\n\nBut in Example 0's 13th row, columns 6-10 are in the third 2 (7-13), but they become 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's output, the 6s often appear in the lower part of the grid. For example, the rows 10-13 have 6s. The 2s are in the upper-middle (rows 3-5), and 1s in the upper part. So maybe the rows are divided into sections. Top rows (say, first third) 1, middle third 2, bottom third 6. Let's check.\n\nExample 0 has 19 rows. So rows 0-6: 1, 7-12: 2, 13-18: 6. But looking at the output:\n\nRow 0: 1s (top)\n\nRow 3: 2s (middle)\n\nRow 4: 2s and 6s.\n\nRow 13: 2s and 1s.\n\nHmm, this doesn't align.\n\nAnother thought: The output numbers could be based on the sum of the row and column indices. For example, (row + column) mod 3. But need to see if that fits.\n\nExample 0's first row (row 0), columns 17 and 18. row + column = 0+17=17, mod 3 \u2192 17 mod 3 is 2 (since 3*5=15, 17-15=2). So output 2, but in the output it's 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, (row * column) mod something. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of the output numbers as possibly being related to the direction of the 3s' connections. For example, a vertical line of 3s becomes 1, a horizontal becomes 2, and an L-shape or other becomes 6.\n\nIn Example 0's fourth row, horizontal 3s \u2192 2. In row 13, horizontal 3s \u2192 1. So why the difference? Maybe because the vertical position. Or perhaps the length of the line. The horizontal line in row 4 has four 3s \u2192 2, while the horizontal line in row 13 has five 3s \u2192 1. So length isn't the factor.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical lines in the upper part are 1, horizontal in the middle are 2, and others in lower part are 6. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the vertical line in row 0 (columns 17-18) is part of a vertical line spanning rows 0-2. The output for these are 1s. Then, a horizontal line in row 4 becomes 2. Another vertical line in row 13 becomes 1. So maybe vertical lines are 1, horizontal 2. Then why in Example 0's row 7, a horizontal line of three 3s becomes 6. Hmm, that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on whether the line is connected to other lines. For example, if a horizontal line is connected to a vertical line, it becomes 6. But that's getting complex.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look for the transformation of each individual 3. For each 3 in the input, what determines if it's 1, 2, or 6?\n\nLooking at Example 0's first row:\n\nInput: [..., 3,3,0,0]\n\nOutput: [..., 1,1,0,0]\n\nThese two 3s are adjacent horizontally. They become 1s.\n\nIn row 3 of Example 0's input:\n\nInput has two isolated 3s (positions 3 and 5) which become 2s. So isolated 3s become 2.\n\nBut in row 4 of Example 0's input, four horizontal 3s become 2s. So groups of 3s can also be 2.\n\nIn row 4's output, there's a group of four 2s and then a group of three 6s. So the 3s on the left are replaced with 2, and the ones on the right with 6. So perhaps the 2 and 6 are determined by their position in the grid, regardless of group type.\n\nMaybe the grid is divided into regions. For Example 0:\n\nLeft half: 3s become 2.\n\nRight half: 3s become 1.\n\nBut in row 4 of Example 0, the 3s on the left (columns 3-6) become 2s, and the 3s on the right (columns 12-14) become 6s. So maybe the right half is further divided into middle-right and far-right, with middle-right being 6 and far-right being 1.\n\nThis is getting too complicated, and I'm not seeing a clear pattern. Let's try to look at the test input and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nTest input's row 6: [0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0]\n\nThis row has two groups of 3s: a horizontal line of five 3s (columns 3-7) and another group of three 3s (columns 10-12). If the first group is horizontal and becomes 2s, the second group, which is also horizontal, would also become 2s, but maybe they are in a different region. Alternatively, the second group is in the right part of the grid and becomes 1 or 6. But how to determine.\n\nIn Example 0, similar groups in different regions get different numbers. So perhaps the test input's 3s in columns 3-7 (left part) become 2s, and those in columns 10-12 (right part) become 6s.\n\nAnother test input row: row 11 has [0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]. The 3s here are in columns 1-6 (six 3s in a row) and column 11. If this row is in the left part, they become 2s. But in Example 0's row 13, a group of five 3s becomes 1s, which are in the middle. So maybe the columns determine it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test input's 3s in the left half become 2s, and those in the right become 6s. For example, in row 0 of the test input, the 3s are in columns 1 and 3 (left half) become 2s, and the 3 in column 12 becomes 6.\n\nRow 2 of test input has 3s in columns 1-3 and 12-14. Columns 1-3 are left half, so 2s; 12-14 are right half, so 6s.\n\nRow 6's 3s in columns 3-7 (left half) become 2s, and columns 10-12 (right) become 6s.\n\nRow 8's 3s in columns 9-12 (right half) become 6s.\n\nRow 11's 3s in columns 1-6 (left half) become 2s, and column 11 (right) becomes 6.\n\nRow 12's 3s in column 6 (left) becomes 2, and columns 11-13 (right) become 6.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the rule could be:\n\n- If a 3 is in the left half of the grid (columns < midpoint), replace it with 2.\n\n- If it's in the right half (columns >= midpoint), replace with 6.\n\n- But in Example 0, some right-hand 3s become 1. So maybe the grid is divided into three vertical sections: left (2), middle (6), and right (1).\n\nFor Example 0's grid, which has 21 columns (indices 0-20). The midpoint would be 10. So:\n\nLeft third: 0-6 \u2192 2\n\nMiddle third:7-13 \u21926\n\nRight third:14-20 \u21921\n\nBut in Example 0's row 4, the 3s in columns 3-6 (left third) become 2s, which fits. The 3s in columns 12-14 (middle third) become 6s. And the 3s in columns 17-18 (right third) become 1s.\n\nThis seems to align. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 1's input is 11 columns (0-10). So thirds would be:\n\nLeft:0-3 \u21922\n\nMiddle:4-6 \u21926\n\nRight:7-10 \u21921\n\nIn Example 1's first row, the 3s are in columns 0-2 (left third) \u2192 1s. But according to this rule, left third should be 2. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. Maybe the division is different. For example, left half: columns less than half of the total columns become 2, right half 6, and certain exceptions. But it's not consistent across examples.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is:\n\n- For each 3, if it is in the same row as another 3 to its left, replace with 2.\n\n- If it's in the same column as another 3 below, replace with 1.\n\n- If both, replace with 6.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0, the output's 1s are in the rightmost part. The 2s are in the left, and 6s in the middle-right. So maybe the output number is based on the column's position modulo 3. For example:\n\ncolumn % 3 == 0 \u2192 2\n\ncolumn % 3 == 1 \u21926\n\ncolumn % 3 == 2 \u21921\n\nLet's check Example 0's first row's 3s in columns 17 and 18. 17%3 = 2 \u21921, 18%3=0 \u21922. But the output is 1 for both. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the pattern is that each 3 is replaced by the sum of the number of 3s in its row and column. For example:\n\nnumber of 3s in row + number of 3s in column \u2192 modulo something.\n\nBut in Example 0's first row, there are two 3s. So row count is 2. Column 17 and 18 may have varying counts. It's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement number is the number of 3s in the same row. For example, if a row has two 3s, replace with 1. Four 3s \u21922. Three \u21926. But in Example 0's row 4, four 3s become 2s. That fits. Row 13 has five 3s \u2192 replaced with 1s. Doesn't fit. So no.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output number is the count of the 3's cell in a specific direction. Like, the number of consecutive 3s to the left, right, above, below, etc.\n\nFor example, in a horizontal line, the count to the left and right would be high, leading to 2. Vertical lines lead to 1. Diagonals lead to 6. But I need to verify.\n\nIn Example 0's row 4, four horizontal 3s \u2192 each has three to the right (for the first one), leading to a total of 3+1 (left and right?), but the output is 2. Not sure.\n\nThis is taking too long. Let's try to come up with a hypothesis based on the examples and apply it to the test input.\n\nHypothesis: The output numbers are determined by the region of the grid where the 3 is located. The grid is divided into three vertical regions:\n\n- Left third: 3s become 2.\n\n- Middle third: 3s become 6.\n\n- Right third: 3s become 1.\n\nBut how to adjust for varying grid widths.\n\nAlternatively, the grid is divided into vertical stripes where every third column cycles through 2, 6, 1.\n\nFor example:\n\nColumn 0 \u21922, column 1\u21926, column2\u21921, column3\u21922, etc.\n\nChecking Example 0's first row: 3s at columns 17 and 18. 17 mod 3 = 2 \u21921. 18 mod3=0 \u21922. So output would be 1 and 2. But the output is both 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the columns are grouped into three parts. For example, for a grid with 21 columns:\n\nLeft 7 columns (0-6) \u21922.\n\nMiddle 7 (7-13)\u21926.\n\nRight 7 (14-20)\u21921.\n\nIn Example 0's row 4, columns 3-6 (left) \u21922. Columns 12-14 (middle) \u21926. Fits.\n\nIn Example 0's row 13, columns 6-10 are in middle (7-13), so 6. But output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting me nowhere. Let's look at the test input's columns. The test input has 16 columns per row (0-15). So divided into three parts:\n\nLeft 5 columns (0-4): 2\n\nMiddle 5 (5-9):6\n\nRight 6 (10-15):1\n\nLet's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest input row 0: 3s at columns 1,3 (left \u21922), and 12 (right \u21921). So output would be [0,2,0,2,0,...1,0...]. But in Example 0's output, similar positions were 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, test input's middle third is columns 5-10, right third 11-15.\n\nSo for row 0, column 12 is right third \u21921.\n\nRow 2's 3s at columns 1-3 (left \u21922) and 12-14 (right \u21921).\n\nBut in Example 0's output, right third 3s became 1s, which matches. Middle third became 6.\n\nSo maybe the test input's 3s in left third become 2, middle third 6, right third 1.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow 0: columns 1 (left \u21922), 3 (left \u21922), 12 (right \u21921). So output row 0: [0,2,0,2,0,...1,0...].\n\nRow 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: columns 1-3 (left \u21922), 12-14 (right \u21921). So output row 2: [0,2,2,2,0,...,1,1,1,0].\n\nRow 3: column 12 (right \u21921) and 14 (right \u21921). So output row 3: [0,...,1,0,1,0].\n\nRow 4: columns 6-7 (middle \u21926), 14 (right \u21921). So output row 4: [0,...,6,6,...,1,0].\n\nRow 5: column 6 (middle \u21926). Output row 5: [0,...,6,0...].\n\nRow 6: columns 3-7 (left and middle). Columns 3-4: left \u21922. Columns 5-7: middle \u21926. Columns 10-12: right \u21921. So output row 6: [0,0,0,2,2,6,6,6,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0].\n\nRow 7: column 12 (right \u21921). Output row 7: [0,...,1,0...].\n\nRow 8: columns 9-12. Columns 9-10: middle \u21926. 11-12: right \u21921. So output row 8: [0,...,6,6,6,1,0,0,0].\n\nRow 11: columns 1-6 (left \u21922), column 11 (right \u21921). So output row 11: [0,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,1,0...].\n\nRow 12: column 6 (middle \u21926), columns 11-13 (right \u21921). Output row 12: [0,...,6,0...,1,1,1,0,0].\n\nRow 13: column 6 (middle \u21926). Output row 13: [0,...,6,0...].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, for example, in Example 0's 13th row, the 3s in columns 6-10 are middle third (assuming 7-13 is middle) would become 6, but in the output they are 1. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. The pattern seems to involve replacing 3s in certain regions of the grid with 1, 2, or 6. Based on the examples, the left part of the grid tends to have 2s, the right part 1s, and middle 6s. So for the test input, I'll replace 3s in the left third with 2, middle third with 6, and right third with 1.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nEach row has 16 columns. So thirds would be:\n\nLeft: 0-5 \u21922\n\nMiddle:6-10 \u21926\n\nRight:11-15 \u21921\n\nSo for each 3 in a column:\n\n- If column 0-5: replace with 2\n\n- column 6-10: replace with 6\n\n- column 11-15: replace with 1\n\nLet's check this against the examples.\n\nExample 0's row 4 has 3s in columns 3-6 (left third and middle). Columns 3-5 \u21922, column 6 \u21926. But in the output, they are all 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, but perhaps the division is different. Maybe for even-width grids, it's split differently. Alternatively, the middle third starts later.\n\nAlternatively, for the test input's 16 columns:\n\nLeft: 0-5 \u21922\n\nMiddle:6-10 \u21926\n\nRight:11-15 \u21921\n\nSo let's apply this:\n\nRow 0: columns 1,3 (both in left \u21922), column 12 (right \u21921). So output row 0: [0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0].\n\nRow 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: columns 1-3 (left \u21922), columns 12-14 (right \u21921). So output row 2: [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0].\n\nRow 3: columns 12 and 14 (both right \u21921). So output row 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0].\n\nRow 4: columns 6-7 (middle \u21926), column 14 (right \u21921). So output row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0].\n\nRow 5: column 6 (middle \u21926). Output row 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 6: columns 3-7 (columns 3-5: left \u21922, 6-7: middle \u21926), columns 10-12 (column 10: middle \u21926, 11-12: right \u21921). Wait, columns 10 is middle (6-10), so 6. Columns 11-12 are right \u21921. So row 6 would have:\n\nColumns 3-5: 2, 2, 2.\n\nColumns 6-7: 6,6.\n\nColumns 10:6.\n\nColumns 11-13:1,1,1.\n\nSo output row 6: [0,0,0,2,2,2,6,6,0,0,6,1,1,1,0,0].\n\nBut the input's row 6 has 3s from columns 3-7 (five 3s) and 10-12 (three 3s). So applying the replacement:\n\nColumns 3-5 \u21922, columns 6-7 \u21926, columns 10\u21926, columns 11-12 \u21921. So the output would be [0,0,0,2,2,2,6,6,0,0,6,1,1,1,0,0].\n\nRow 7: column 12 (right \u21921). Output row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0].\n\nRow 8: columns 9-12 (columns 9-10: middle \u21926, 11-12: right \u21921). So output row 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,1,1,0,0,0].\n\nRow 11: columns 1-6 (columns 1-5 \u21922, column 6\u21926), column 11 (right \u21921). So output row 11: [0,2,2,2,2,2,6,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 12: column 6 (middle \u21926), columns 11-13 (right \u21921). So output row 12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0].\n\nRow 13: column 6 (middle \u21926). Output row 13: [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nThis seems to fit the pattern observed in the training examples, where certain regions are mapped to different numbers. However, this is a hypothesis based on the test input's structure and the examples. Since the actual pattern wasn't clear, this is the best I can do. The output would replace 3s based on their column positions into 2, 6, or 1.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to transform the input lists (which consist of 0s and 3s) into output lists that have different numbers like 1, 2, 6, etc. Let's look at the training examples to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a bunch of 3s arranged in certain patterns, and the output replaces those 3s with 1s, 2s, or 6s. Hmm. Let's look at the first input row in Example 0: the original input ends with 3,3,0,0. The output for those is 1,1,0,0. Wait, so maybe the 3s are being converted to 1s here. But then in another row, the input has a 3 in the middle, and the output is 2. So maybe the replacement depends on the position or some surrounding cells.\n\nLooking at the fourth row in Example 0's input: [0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0...] becomes [0,0,0,2,2,2,2,0...]. Then later in the same example, there's a part where 3,3,3 becomes 6,6,6. So the same input value of 3 is transformed into different numbers in the output. That suggests that the transformation isn't a simple substitution. There must be a rule based on the context around each 3.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the first input row is [3,3,3,0...], which becomes [1,1,1,0...]. Then in a later row, [3,3,3,3,3] becomes [2,2,2,2,2]. So again, the same input 3s become different numbers. So maybe it's related to the group they are part of, like different regions of 3s are mapped to different numbers. But how?\n\nLooking at the outputs: The numbers used are 1, 2, 6. Wait, 1 and 2 are low, 6 is higher. Maybe these numbers represent the count of adjacent 3s or some other property. Alternatively, perhaps it's based on the number of 3s in a certain pattern around them. For instance, maybe each 3 is part of a shape, and the output numbers depend on the shape's properties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are determined by the position of the 3s in the grid. For example, vertical lines of 3s become 1s, horizontal become 2s, and blocks (like 3x3 squares) become 6s. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first three rows have 3s in positions that look vertical. Let's see the output for those. For example, the first input row has two 3s at positions 17 and 18. The output has 1s there. Then in the fourth row of input, there's a horizontal line of four 3s (positions 3 to 6), and the output is 2s. So maybe vertical 3s become 1, horizontal become 2, and other shapes (like 3x3 blocks) become 6.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has a horizontal line of 3s in the first row (3,3,3), which becomes 1s. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm. Wait, no, in Example 1's first input row: [3,3,3,0...] becomes [1,1,1,0...]. Then, in a lower row, there's [3,3,3,3,3] which becomes [2,2,2,2,2]. So maybe the direction isn't the key. Alternatively, maybe the output numbers are assigned based on some order of regions. Like the first group of 3s encountered is 1, the next is 2, then 6, etc. But looking at the outputs, sometimes the same number appears in different regions. For example, in Example 0's output, there are multiple regions with 2 and 6. So that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 3 is transformed into a number based on the number of live neighbors, similar to Conway's Game of Life. But the outputs are 1, 2, 6, which don't directly correspond to neighbor counts. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, looking at the input's fourth row: [0,0,0,3,0,0,3,0...]. The output for those 3s is 2. Let's check their neighbors. Each 3 here is isolated. The first 3 at position 3 has neighbors: maybe none, so maybe the number of adjacent 3s. If the count is 0, but that doesn't explain 2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the output numbers 1, 2, 6. Maybe 1+2=3, but that's a stretch. Wait, 1 and 2 are primes, 6 is their product. Not sure. Maybe the output is the sum of some values. Alternatively, 1, 2, 6 could represent different categories. Let's see.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output again. Let's take a specific cell. For instance, in the fourth row of input, there are four 3s in a horizontal line. The output is 2s. Then in the same input, the next row has a single 3 (position 3) which becomes 2. Wait, but that 3 is part of a vertical line? No, looking at the input:\n\nRow 4 (input): [0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0...] becomes 2s. So four in a row. Then row 5: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0...] becomes 2, so that's the first element of a vertical line? Or maybe that's part of the same horizontal line but with a gap. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is determined by the number of adjacent 3s (including diagonally). Let's check. For example, in Example 0's first input row, the two 3s (positions 17,18) are adjacent. The output is 1s. Let's count their neighbors. Each has one neighbor (the other 3). But how that leads to 1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are based on the number of connected 3s in their group. For example, a group of two 3s becomes 1, a group of four becomes 2, a larger group becomes 6. Let's check. In Example 0's first input row, two 3s in a group, output 1. The horizontal line of four 3s in row 4 becomes 2. Then in row 7 of the input, there's a group of three 3s, but the output is 6,6,6. Wait, three 3s in a vertical line? Let me check. Row 7 in input example 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0...]. Output is 6,6,6. So three 3s in a horizontal line here. So group size 3 becomes 6. But group size 4 becomes 2, group size 2 becomes 1. That doesn't follow a direct size-to-number mapping. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers 1, 2, 6 are related to directions. Like 1 for vertical lines, 2 for horizontal, and 6 for blocks. Let's see. In Example 0, the two vertical 3s in row 0 output 1s. The horizontal four 3s in row 4 become 2s. Then the three horizontal 3s in row 7's output are 6. Wait, that doesn't fit. Unless horizontal lines of length 3 or more are 6. But in example 1, the first row's horizontal 3s become 1, not 6. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are determined by some other property. Let's look for another pattern. Let's check the coordinates. For example, in Example 0, the output 6s appear in certain positions. Let's look at the input rows where 3s become 6. In Example 0, row 4's output has 6,6,6 in columns 12,13,14. The input there is 3,3,3. Looking at surrounding cells in the input, perhaps those 3s form a horizontal line but are part of a larger structure. Not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: maybe the output numbers are related to the sum of the digits in the input's neighborhood. For example, if a 3 is surrounded by two other 3s, the sum could be 9 (3+3+3), but the output is 6. Wait, 9 divided by 1.5 is 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output numbers are determined by the number of 3s in the same row and column. For example, in Example 0's row 0, there are two 3s in the row. Output is 1 for each. In row 4, four 3s in the row, output is 2 each. In row 7, three 3s in the row, output 6 each. But that doesn't fit a clear pattern. For example, 2 in the row gives 1, 4 gives 2, 3 gives 6. Not a direct relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of adjacent 3s in specific directions. For example, if a 3 has a neighbor to the left and right (horizontal), it's a 2. If it has neighbors above and below (vertical), it's a 1. And if it's part of a block (like a 2x2 square), it's 6. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's row 0, the two 3s are next to each other horizontally. So they would be 2s. But the output is 1s. That contradicts. So maybe vertical neighbors. Wait, maybe if a 3 is part of a vertical line, it becomes 1. If part of a horizontal line, 2. If part of a T-shape or other, 6. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row, the two 3s are consecutive. Looking vertically, in the next rows (row 1 and 2), there's a single 3 in the same column. Wait, in row 0, positions 17 and 18 are 3. Row 1, position 18 is 3. Row 2, position 18 is 3. So maybe that's a vertical line of three 3s. But in row 0, both 17 and 18 are 3, but rows 1 and 2 have 18 as 3. So perhaps that's a vertical line starting at row 0, column 17 and 18. But the output for those in row 0 is 1s. Then row 1, position 18 becomes 1. Row 2, position 18 becomes 1. So maybe vertical lines are 1s.\n\nIn row 4 of the input, the four 3s are in a horizontal line, and output is 2s. So horizontal lines become 2s. Then in row 7, the three 3s are in a horizontal line, output is 6. Wait, that's conflicting. So maybe longer horizontal lines become 6? But in Example 1, a row with five 3s in a horizontal line becomes 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output depends on the presence of 3s in both rows and columns. For example, a 3 that is part of a horizontal and vertical line (like a cross) becomes 6. Let's check. In Example 0's row 13 (input), there's a horizontal line of five 3s. The output is 1s. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where the input 3s are converted to 1, 2, or 6. For example, in Example 0's output, 1s appear in vertical lines, 2s in horizontal lines, and 6s in blocks. Let's see:\n\n- The first output row's 1s are part of a vertical line (positions 17,18 in row 0, 18 in rows 1 and 2). So vertical lines become 1s.\n- The horizontal line in input row 4 becomes 2s.\n- The group of three 3s in input row 7 becomes 6s. Wait, but that's a horizontal line of three. So maybe horizontal lines of three or more become 6? But in Example 1's first row, a horizontal line of three becomes 1s. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output number is based on the length of the line (horizontal or vertical) that the 3 is part of. For example, vertical lines of 1, 2, or more become 1; horizontal lines of length 2 become 2, and longer lines become 6. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's take Example 1's input and output. The first input row has three 3s in a horizontal line, output is 1s. Then, later there's a row with five 3s in a horizontal line (input row 6), which becomes 2s. Hmm, that's confusing. So a horizontal line of three becomes 1, a horizontal line of five becomes 2. That doesn't fit a length-based pattern.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the output numbers are assigned based on the layer or the region's position. For example, the first region encountered (top-left) is 1, next is 2, then 6, etc. But in Example 0's output, there are multiple regions with 2 and 6. Maybe the numbering is based on the order of processing, but it's unclear.\n\nAnother observation: The output numbers 1, 2, and 6. 1 and 2 are primes, 6 is their product. Maybe the numbers represent the product of the number of vertical and horizontal neighbors plus 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of binary. 1 in binary is 01, 2 is 10, 6 is 110. Maybe each 3 is replaced by a code based on the presence of adjacent 3s. For example, if a 3 has a 3 to the left and right, it's a horizontal line (binary 10, which is 2). If it has 3s above and below, vertical (binary 01, which is 1). If both, then 11 (3), but 6 is 110. Not matching exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number represents the sum of adjacent 3s. For example, a 3 with two adjacent 3s (left and right) would have sum 6 (each adjacent 3 is 3, 3+3=6). But in Example 0's row 4, the horizontal line of four 3s would each have two adjacent 3s (except the ends), so sum 6, and the output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output number is the count of adjacent 3s (including diagonally). Let's check. For example, in Example 0's row 0, the 3 at position 17 (0-based) has a 3 to the right (position 18) and maybe none above or below. So adjacent count is 1 (right). Then output is 1. If the output is the adjacent count, that could work. But for the horizontal line in row 4: each 3 in the middle has two adjacent 3s (left and right). So adjacent count is 2. Output is 2. That fits. For the end of the line, like the first 3 in row 4 (position 3), adjacent count to the right is 1 (since the next is 3). So output would be 1. But in the output, it's 2. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 0, row 4: input is [0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0...]. The output is [0,0,0,2,2,2,2,0...]. Each 3 in the middle has two neighbors (left and right), but the output is 2 for all. The first 3 (position 3) has a 3 to the right (position 4), so adjacent count is 1. But output is 2. So that doesn't align. So this idea is probably wrong.\n\nAnother angle: Let's think of the output numbers as representing different types of shapes. For example, 1 is vertical line, 2 is horizontal, 6 is a corner or a block. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's row 13 input: [3,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0...]. Output is [2,2,2,2,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0...]. So the first four 3s become 2s (horizontal line?), and the next five 3s become 1s (vertical line?). But looking at the input's row 13: the first four 3s are in a horizontal line, and the next five 3s are part of a horizontal line. Wait, perhaps not. Wait, maybe the output is determined by the direction of the entire group. For example, a vertical group becomes 1, horizontal becomes 2, and other shapes (like L-shape or T-shape) become 6. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 13 has a group of five 3s in a horizontal line (columns 6-10), and the output for those is 1. But according to this idea, horizontal should be 2. So that's conflicting. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are determined by the number of 3s in the entire group. For example, groups of two 3s become 1, groups of four become 2, groups of five become 1. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of 3s in the same column. For example, each 3 is replaced by the count of 3s in its column. In Example 0's first input row, column 17 has a 3. Looking down the rows, columns 17 and 18 in row 0. Let's check how many 3s are in column 17. Looking at all rows:\n\nRow 0: 3 at 17,18\nRow 1: 3 at 18\nRow 2: 3 at 18\nRow 3: 3s at 3 and 6\nRow 4: 3s at 3,4,5,6, 12,13,14\n...\n\nHmm, perhaps not. For example, column 3 in row 3 and row 4 has 3s, but output is 2. So if the column count was 2, then output 2. But row 4's output is 2 for those, which could match. But in Example 0's row 0, column 17 has a 3, but how many 3s in that column? Let's see:\n\nLooking at column 17 in all rows:\n\nRow 0: 3\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 0\nRow 3: 0\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7: 0\nRow 8: 0\nRow 9: 0\nRow 10: 0\nRow 11: 0\nRow 12: 0\nRow 13: 0\nRow 14: 0\nRow 15: 0\nRow 16: 3 (row 16's input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0])\nWait, maybe not. This approach is getting too time-consuming.\n\nWait, perhaps each 3 is replaced by the number of its connected regions. For example, the first connected region of 3s is 1, the second is 2, third is 6. But in Example 0's output, there are multiple regions with 2 and 6. So maybe the regions are numbered in a certain order, and their number is determined by their size or position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are based on the number of adjacent 3s in specific directions. For example, a 3 that has a 3 to the left and right (horizontal) becomes 2. A 3 with 3s above and below (vertical) becomes 1. If a 3 has 3s in both horizontal and vertical directions, it becomes 6. Let's test this.\n\nTake Example 0's row 4, the four horizontal 3s. Each has 3s to the left and right (except the ends). So for the middle 3s, they have two horizontal neighbors. So output is 2. The ends have one neighbor. But in the output, all four are 2. So maybe any horizontal neighbor (even one) makes it 2. But then in row 0's two 3s, they are horizontal neighbors, so they would be 2, but the output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, vertical neighbors lead to 1. So if a 3 has a 3 above or below, it's 1. Horizontal neighbors lead to 2. But what if it has both? Then it's 6. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's row 0, the two 3s are in columns 17 and 18. Looking at the rows below (row 1 and 2), there's a 3 in column 18. So the 3 in column 18 of row 0 has a 3 below it (row 1 and 2). So vertical neighbors, so output 1. The 3 in column 17 has no 3s below it. Wait, but in row 0, the 3 in column 17 is adjacent to column 18's 3. So if the rule is that vertical presence leads to 1, but horizontal leads to 2, then in row 0, the two 3s (columns 17 and 18) are horizontal neighbors, so they should be 2. But the output is 1. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the 6s often appear in groups of three or more. Like in row 4, output 6,6,6. In the input, that's three 3s. So maybe groups of three or more 3s become 6s. But in Example 1's first input row, three 3s become 1s, not 6. So that's not right.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the first row is three 3s (horizontal), output 1s. Then, in the sixth row of input, there are five 3s (horizontal), output 2s. So perhaps the count isn't the determining factor.\n\nWait, maybe the output numbers are assigned based on the parity of the row. For example, even rows have 1s, odd rows have 2s, and certain cases have 6s. But Example 0's row 4 (even) outputs 2s, which would not fit.\n\nAnother observation: The output numbers 1, 2, and 6. Let's add them: 1+2=3, which is the input number. Maybe this is a hint. So each 3 is split into 1 and 2, or multiplied to get 6. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 3 is being decomposed into 1 and 2, where the sum is 3. For example, vertical line 3s become 1s, horizontal become 2s, and when both are present, it's 6 (1+2+3=6? Not sure). Or perhaps 1 and 2 are components of 3 (since 1+2=3), and 6 is 2*3. Not sure.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Let's look at the test input. The test input has several rows with 3s. For example:\n\nRow 0: [0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: [0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0]\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0]\nRow 6: [0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0]\nRow 11: [0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\nRow 12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0]\n\nIf the pattern is that vertical 3s become 1s, horizontal become 2s, and others (like blocks) become 6, then:\n\nIn row 0 of the test input, there are isolated 3s at positions 1 and 3, and another at 12. If they're part of vertical lines, they might become 1s. But let's see if they are part of vertical lines. Looking down the rows:\n\nTest input rows 0,1: both have 3s at positions 1 and 3. So in column 1, rows 0 and 1 have 3s. Column 3, rows 0 and 1 have 3s. So vertical lines of two 3s. So output would be 1s in those positions.\n\nRow 2: [0,3,3,3,0...] which is a horizontal line of three 3s. If horizontal lines become 2s, then output would be 2,2,2.\n\nRow 3: 3s at positions 12 and 14. If they are part of a vertical line, but row 4's 3s are at 12,13,14 (row 4: [...,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0], wait no. Let me check row 4 of test input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0]. So in row 4, columns 6 and 7 are 3s (part of a horizontal line?), and column 12,13,14 are 3s. So in row 3, columns 12 and 14 have 3s. Row 4, column 12-14 are 3s. So in column 12, rows 3 and 4 have 3s. So vertical line of 2, so output 1s. Column 14, row 3 has 3, row 4 has 3. So another vertical line of two, output 1s. So row 3's output would be 0s except for positions 12 and 14 being 1s. But the input also has a 3 at position 14 in row 3. Wait, maybe the 3 in position 14 of row 3 is part of a vertical line with row 4's position 14 (which is 3) and row 5's position 14 (which is 0). So that's a vertical line of two. So output would be 1s there.\n\nRow 6 of test input has five 3s in a horizontal line (positions 3-7) and three in columns 10-12. So horizontal lines, so output would be 2s for the first part and maybe 6 for the latter? Or depends on the length. But in Example 0, a horizontal line of four became 2s, but in Example 1, a horizontal line of five became 2s. So maybe any horizontal line (regardless of length) becomes 2. Then row 6's horizontal line of five would become 2s. The three 3s at columns 10-12 would also be horizontal, so 2s. But in Example 0, a horizontal line of three became 6s. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the output depends on whether the 3 is part of a vertical or horizontal line. If it's part of both, like a cross, then output 6. Let's see. For example, a 3 that is part of a vertical line and a horizontal line would become 6. But how to verify this.\n\nIn Example 0's row 13 input: [3,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0...]. The first four 3s are horizontal, output 2. Then the next five 3s are also horizontal but output 1. This contradicts the previous idea.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Let's try to see the examples again and see if there's any other pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, in row 4, the 3s in columns 3-6 are replaced by 2s, and in columns 12-14, replaced by 6s. The input for columns 12-14 in row 4 is three 3s. So why 6? Maybe because those 3s are part of a larger structure. Looking at the input for row 4: columns 12-14 are 3s. In row 5, column 12 is 3, row 6, column 12 is 3, row 7, columns 12-14 are 3s. So perhaps a vertical line in columns 12-14 across multiple rows. But how does that affect the output?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output number is based on the sum of the number of vertical and horizontal adjacent 3s. For example, if a 3 has one horizontal neighbor and one vertical neighbor, sum is 2, which becomes 6. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for all occurrences of 6 in the outputs and see what their input contexts are.\n\nIn Example 0's output, 6s appear in rows 4,5,6,7,10,11,12,15,16,17. For example, row 4's 6s are at columns 12-14 (input has 3s there). Looking at the input in row 4: columns 12-14 are 3s. In row 5, column 12 is 3, others are 0. Row 6, column 12 is 3. Row 7, columns 12-14 are 3s. So maybe this is a vertical line in column 12 that also has a horizontal line in row 4 and 7. So maybe the 3s at columns 12-14 in row 4 are part of a T-shape, hence 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a 3 is part of both a horizontal and vertical line, it becomes 6. For example, if a 3 is part of a horizontal line and there's a vertical line intersecting it. Let's see. In Example 0's row 4, the 3s in columns 12-14 are part of a horizontal line in row 4. Then, in column 12, there are 3s in rows 4,5,6,7. So the 3 at row 4, column 12 is part of a horizontal line and a vertical line. Hence, output is 6. That fits. Similarly, in row 7, columns 12-14 are horizontal, and column 12 has vertical 3s. So those would be 6s.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 6: [3,3,3,3,3], output 2s. This is a horizontal line, and there's no vertical line intersecting, so output is 2.\n\nIn Example 0's row 13 input: the first four 3s are horizontal (output 2s) but there's no vertical line intersecting, so they stay 2s. The next five 3s are horizontal (output 1s). But why? Maybe that's a vertical line elsewhere. Looking at column 6 in Example 0's input: row 13's input has 3 at column 6, which is part of a vertical line. Looking at other rows: row 13, column 6: 3. Row 14, column 6: 3. Row 15, column 6: 3. So a vertical line of three 3s. So the 3s in column 6 of row 13 are part of a vertical line, hence output 1s. But they are also part of a horizontal line. So the output is 1 because they are part of a vertical line, overriding the horizontal? Or the vertical takes precedence.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the rule could be:\n\n- Each 3 is replaced by 1 if it is part of a vertical line (has 3s above or below).\n- Replaced by 2 if it is part of a horizontal line (has 3s to the left or right).\n- If it is part of both a vertical and horizontal line (i.e., at the intersection), it becomes 6.\n\nLet's test this with the examples.\n\nExample 0's first row: the two 3s are in a horizontal line (adjacent). But looking down the rows, there's a 3 in the same column (row 1 and 2 have 3 in column 18). So the 3 in column 18 of row 0 has a 3 below it. So it's part of a vertical line. Hence, output 1. The 3 in column 17 of row 0 has a 3 to the right (column 18) but no 3 below. So it's part of a horizontal line. Hence, should be 2. But the output is 1. Hmm, this contradicts. So maybe the vertical line takes precedence.\n\nWait, in row 0, column 17 and 18: both 3s. Column 18 has 3s in rows 0,1,2. So vertical line. Column 17 has 3 only in row 0. So the 3 in column 17 is part of a horizontal line (row 0, columns 17-18), and the 3 in column 18 is part of a vertical line (rows 0-2). So according to the rule, column 17's 3 should be 2 (horizontal), and column 18's 3 should be 1 (vertical). But in the output, both are 1. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, if a 3 is part of any vertical line (even if it's in a horizontal line), it becomes 1. So vertical takes precedence. Then the 3 in column 17 of row 0 is part of a horizontal line, but since it's not part of a vertical line, it becomes 2. But the output is 1. So this still doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the pattern is different. Let's think about the output numbers and their positions. In Example 0, the 1s are in vertical lines, 2s in horizontal, and 6s where they cross. For instance, in row 4, columns 12-14 are 6s. Let's check if those positions are part of both horizontal and vertical lines.\n\nRow 4's columns 12-14 are 3s (horizontal). In column 12, there are 3s in rows 4,5,6,7. So vertical line. Thus, each 3 in row 4, columns 12-14 is part of both a horizontal and vertical line. Hence, output 6. But according to the example output, row 4's columns 12-14 are 6,6,6. So that fits. Similarly, row 7's columns 12-14 are 3s (horizontal) and column 12 has 3s in multiple rows (vertical), so output 6.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 6: five 3s in a horizontal line. There's no vertical line intersecting, so output is 2s. That fits.\n\nIn Example 0's row 13 input: the first four 3s are part of a horizontal line (output 2s), and the next five 3s are part of a vertical line (output 1s). For example, the 3s in column 6 of row 13 are part of a vertical line spanning rows 13,14,15. So output 1s. That fits.\n\nSo the rule seems to be:\n\n- If a 3 is part of a vertical line (has 3s above or below), output 1.\n- If it's part of a horizontal line (has 3s to the left or right), output 2.\n- If it's part of both, output 6.\n\nThis seems to explain the examples.\n\nLet's verify with Example 0's first row:\n\nThe 3s in columns 17 and 18 of row 0. Column 18 has 3s in rows 0,1,2 (vertical line), so output 1. Column 17 has 3s only in row 0 (part of a horizontal line), so output 2. But in the output, both are 1. Wait, this contradicts. So maybe my rule is incomplete.\n\nAh, wait, maybe the rule is that if a 3 is part of any vertical line (even if it's part of a horizontal line), it's output as 1. Only if it's purely horizontal (no vertical line), it's output as 2. And if it's part of both, it's 6.\n\nBut in the first row of Example 0, the 3 in column 17 is part of a horizontal line (with column 18), but column 17's 3 is not part of a vertical line. So it should output 2. But the output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the rule isn't correct. Perhaps there's another factor.\n\nAlternative idea: The output number is determined by the number of adjacent 3s in each orthogonal direction. For example, count the number of 3s to the left and right (horizontal) and above and below (vertical). Then, if horizontal count is greater than vertical, output 2. If vertical is greater, output 1. If both are non-zero, output 6.\n\nLet's test this. In Example 0's row 0, column 17: to the right is a 3 (count horizontal =1). Vertical: no 3s above or below (row 0 is the top). So horizontal count (1) > vertical (0). So output 2. But output is 1. So not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for other patterns.\n\nIn Example 0, the output numbers 1, 2, and 6. Let's think of them as separate regions. For example, each contiguous region of 3s in the input is mapped to a unique number in the output. The first region is 1, the second is 2, the third is 6, then repeats. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first region of 3s is in row 0, columns 17-18. Output is 1s. Then the next region is row 3, columns 3 and 6. Output is 2s. Then row 4, columns 3-6 (horizontal line) \u2192 output 2s. Wait, but if they're separate regions, perhaps each new region increments the number. But in Example 0's output, the same numbers appear in different regions. For instance, 2 appears in row 3 and row 4, which are separate regions. So this approach is unlikely.\n\nAnother idea: The output numbers are assigned based on the shape of the 3s. For example, vertical lines (like |) are 1, horizontal (like \u2014) are 2, and corners or intersections are 6.\n\nIn Example 0's row 0, columns 17-18: two 3s horizontally. But the output is 1s. So that would imply vertical, but they are horizontal. Doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think of the output as being derived from the input's 3s replaced by the count of 3s in some way. For example, each 3 is replaced by the number of 3s in its row multiplied by the number in its column. But that seems too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are assigned based on the positions of the 3s modulo some number. For example, row index modulo 3 or something. But Example 0's first output row is 0, which modulo 3 is 0, but the output there is 1s. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In the training examples, the outputs 1, 2, 6 appear. 1 and 2 are single digits, 6 is the only double-digit. Wait, but no, all are single digits. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 1 represents a vertical line segment, 2 a horizontal line segment, and 6 a node where vertical and horizontal meet. So in a cross shape, the center 3 becomes 6. For example, in Example 0's row 4, column 12: it's part of a horizontal line in row 4 and a vertical line in column 12. So it's a cross, becomes 6.\n\nLet's test this. In Example 0's row 4, columns 12-14 are 3s (horizontal), and column 12 has 3s in rows 4,5,6,7 (vertical). So the 3 at row 4, column 12 is part of a cross, so becomes 6. The 3s in columns 13 and 14 are only part of the horizontal line and not part of a vertical line, so they should be 2. But in the output, all three are 6. Hmm, that's conflicting. So maybe any cell that is part of both a vertical and horizontal line becomes 6, regardless of position. So in row 4, columns 12-14 are all part of the horizontal line and column 12 is part of a vertical line. So only column 12's cell would be 6, and 13 and 14 would be 2. But the output shows all three as 6. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think the pattern is that each 3 is replaced by the sum of the number of vertical and horizontal lines it is part of. For example, if a 3 is part of a vertical line (length >=2), add 1. If part of a horizontal line (length >=2), add 2. So:\n\n- Part of vertical line only: 1\n- Part of horizontal line only: 2\n- Part of both: 1+2=3, but output uses 6 instead. Or maybe multiply: 1*2=2. Not sure.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 4, the 3s in columns 12-14 are part of a horizontal line (add 2) and column 12's 3 is part of a vertical line (add 1). So total 3. But the output is 6. So 3 is replaced by 6. Maybe it's multiplied by 2? 3*2=6. But why?\n\nAlternatively, sum the vertical and horizontal contributions and multiply by something. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output for a cell that is part of both vertical and horizontal lines is 6 (1 for vertical + 2 for horizontal + 3 for being part of both = 6). But that's arbitrary.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis:\n\n- Each 3 is replaced by 1 if it's part of a vertical line (two or more 3s in the same column, consecutive).\n- Replaced by 2 if part of a horizontal line.\n- Replaced by 6 if part of both.\n\nBased on this, I'll try to apply it to the test input.\n\nNow, let's process the test input:\n\nTest Input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: [0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0]\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0]\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0]\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 6: [0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0]\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0]\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\nRow 11: [0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\nRow 12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0]\nRow 13: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nProcessing each 3:\n\nRow 0, column 1: 3. Check if part of vertical or horizontal line.\n\nLooking vertically: in row 0 and 1, column 1 has 3s. So vertical line of two. So output 1.\n\nRow 0, column 3: 3. Check vertically: rows 0 and 1 have 3s in column 3. Vertical line \u2192 output 1.\n\nRow 0, column 12: 3. Check vertically: rows 0,1 have 3s. Vertical line \u2192 output 1.\n\nRow 2, columns 1-3: horizontal line of three 3s \u2192 output 2 each.\n\nRow 2, columns 12-14: horizontal line of three 3s \u2192 output 2 each.\n\nRow 3, column 12: 3. Check vertically: rows 0,1,2,3,4 have 3s. Vertical line \u2192 output 1.\n\nRow 3, column 14: 3. Check vertically: rows 3 and 4 have 3s. Vertical line \u2192 output 1.\n\nRow 4, columns 6-7: 3s. Horizontal line \u2192 output 2 each.\n\nRow 4, columns 12-14: horizontal line of three 3s. But check vertically: column 12 has 3s in rows 0,1,2,3,4. So each 3 in row 4, columns 12-14 is part of a vertical line (column 12) and horizontal line (row 4). So output 6 each.\n\nRow 6, columns 3-7: horizontal line of five 3s \u2192 output 2 each.\n\nRow 6, columns 10-12: horizontal line of three 3s. Check if any are part of vertical lines. Column 10: no other 3s. Columns 11: in row 11, column 11 has 3s. But row 6's column 11 is 0. So no. So output 2 each.\n\nRow 7, column 12: 3. Vertical line from rows 0-4,7. So output 1.\n\nRow 8, columns 9-12: horizontal line of four 3s. Check vertical lines: no 3s in those columns except in row 8. So output 2 each.\n\nRow 10, column 11: 3. No adjacent 3s \u2192 part of a single 3. But according to examples, single 3s are replaced by 1 or 2? Let's check training examples. In Example 0's row 3, there are isolated 3s at columns 3 and 6. The output is 2. So perhaps isolated 3s are considered horizontal or vertical. Wait, in Example 0's row 3, the input has two isolated 3s. The output is 2 for each. So maybe isolated 3s are treated as horizontal? Not sure. For the test input's row 10, column 11's 3: no neighbors. So according to training example, maybe it's 2. But in Example 0's row 3, the isolated 3s are output as 2. So perhaps single 3s are output as 2.\n\nRow 11, columns 1-6: horizontal line of six 3s \u2192 output 2 each. Column 11: 3. Check vertically: row 10 has 3 in column 11. So vertical line of two. So column 11's 3 in row 11 is part of vertical line. Output 1. But also part of horizontal line. So output 6.\n\nRow 12, column 6: 3. Check vertically: rows 12 and 13 have 3s. So vertical line \u2192 output 1. Column 11: 3. Check vertically: rows 11 and 12 have 3s. So vertical line. So column 11's 3 in row 12 is part of vertical line. But also part of horizontal line in row 12 (columns 11-13). So output 6.\n\nRow 12, columns 12-14: horizontal line of three 3s. Check if part of vertical lines. Column 12: rows 0,1,2,3,4,7,12. So vertical line. So each 3 in row 12, columns 12-14 is part of horizontal and vertical \u2192 output 6.\n\nRow 13, column 6: 3. Part of vertical line (rows 12 and 13) \u2192 output 1.\n\nPutting it all together, the test output would have:\n\nRow 0: [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 11: [0,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0]\n\nRow 13: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut I need to check if this matches the training examples' logic. For instance, in Example 0's row 3, the isolated 3s are output as 2s. So single 3s are considered horizontal (2). But in the test input's row 10, the isolated 3 would be 2.\n\nHowever, in the test input's row 3, the 3s in columns 12 and 14 are part of vertical lines, so they become 1s. The 3 in row 4, column 12 is part of a vertical and horizontal line, so becomes 6.\n\nThis seems to fit the hypothesis. Therefore, the final answer would follow this pattern.",
