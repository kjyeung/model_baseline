        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples provided. Then, apply that pattern to the test input and generate the correct output.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the training examples to understand what's going on. Let's start with Example 0. The input and output look similar except for some elements changing to 3. For instance, in the input of Example 0, the third row has a bunch of 8s. In the output, some 1s near those 8s are replaced with 3s. Specifically, looking at the fourth line of Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput line: [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nOutput line: [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\nSo the 1s adjacent to the 8 in positions 5,6,8,9 (if we start counting from 0) are turned into 3s. Similarly, other lines in the output where 8s are present have neighboring 1s converted to 3s. \n\nWait, but in another line from Example 0's input:\n\nInput line: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nOutput line: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nHere, the 1s next to the 8 (positions 5,7,8,9) are changed to 3s. So the pattern seems to be that any 1 that is adjacent (either horizontally or vertically, maybe?) to an 8 is replaced with a 3. But how exactly? Let's check other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1. In the input, there are some 8s in lines 7,8,9. The output replaces some 1s with 3s around those 8s. For example, line 8 input is [0, 8, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the output is [0, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The 1s next to 8s here (positions 2,4,5,6) become 3s. So again, it's the 1s adjacent to 8s that are replaced. But also, in line 9 of Example 1's input, there's [0, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], which becomes [0, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So all the 1s next to 8s are turned into 3s, regardless of their position relative to the 8 (left, right, maybe up or down?).\n\nIn Example 2, the input has lines with 8s and the output replaces nearby 1s with 3s. For instance, input line 3 is [1, 0, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], which becomes [1, 0, 1, 1, 8, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. The 1s next to the 8s at positions 4,5,6,8 are replaced with 3s.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: wherever there's an 8 in the input, all adjacent 1s (horizontally or vertically) in the same row are replaced with 3. Wait, but in Example 0's fourth line, the 8 is in position 7 (0-based), and the 1s at positions 5,6,8,9 (which are left, right) become 3s. So horizontal adjacency. But in another example, like line 8 of Example 1's input, the 1s are adjacent in the same row. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's horizontal adjacency only? Let me check. For instance, in Example 0's line 3, the 8 is in the middle. The 1s to the left and right (positions 5,6,8,9) become 3s. So perhaps in the same row, any 1 that is immediately next to an 8 (either left or right) gets replaced with 3. So the transformation is: in each row, for each 8, replace the 1s immediately adjacent (left and right) to 8 with 3. Wait, but in Example 0's line 5, the input has [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]. The 8 is at position 6. The 1s at 5,7,8,9 (positions 5 is left, 7,8,9 are right of 8). So in output, these become 3s. So left and right adjacent 1s, but maybe in the same row. So perhaps the rule is: in each row, any 1 that is adjacent (left or right) to an 8 is replaced by 3.\n\nBut then, what about vertical adjacency? For example, in the test input, maybe there's an 8 in a row, and the row above or below has 1s adjacent to the 8's position. But looking at the training examples, I don't see any cases where vertical adjacency is considered. For instance, in Example 0, the line with 8s is followed by lines that have 1s in the same column as 8s, but those 1s aren't replaced. For example, in Example 0's input line 2 is [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The next line (line3) has 1s in the same columns (positions 5,6,7,8,9?), but those 1s are changed to 3s. Wait, no. Line 3 in input is [1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1]. The 8 is at position7. The 1s at positions5,6 (left), 8,9 (right) are turned into 3s. So perhaps the rule is only horizontal adjacency. So for any 8 in a row, the immediate left and right 1s are replaced with 3s. Additionally, if multiple 8s are adjacent, perhaps it's handled accordingly.\n\nWait, in Example 1's line 8 input is [0,8,1,8,1,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]. The 8s are at positions1,3,7,8. The output changes 1s adjacent to those 8s. For example, the 1 at position2 (adjacent to 8 at 1 and 3) becomes 3. The 1s at positions4,5,6 (adjacent to 8 at3 and 7/8?) Hmm, position3 is an 8, so the 1 at4 is adjacent to the right of 3, and position4's 1 is next to 8 at3. Then positions5,6 are 1s next to each other and to the 8s at7,8. But in the output, positions4,5,6 become 3s. So it's any 1 that is adjacent (left or right) to an 8 in the same row.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: For each element in a row, if the element is 1 and has an 8 immediately to the left or right, replace it with 3. But also, if there's an 8 in the same position in the same row, but how about consecutive 8s? For example, if there's a sequence like 8,8, then the 8s next to each other would not affect 1s. Wait, in Example 0's line2 input: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The next line in input (line3) has 1s next to the 8s. But in the output, the 1s adjacent to the 8s in line3 are replaced with 3s. So the transformation is applied to each row individually, not considering other rows. So the vertical neighbors are not considered, only horizontal.\n\nSo the pattern is: In each row, for each occurrence of 8, replace any 1 that is immediately adjacent (left or right) to the 8 with 3. If there are multiple 8s next to each other, the 1s adjacent to any of them are replaced.\n\nNow, looking at the test input. Let's find the rows that have 8s. In the test input, the lines 11,12,13,14 have 8s. Let's look at line11:\n\nTest input line11: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nIn this row, the 8s are at positions7,9,10,12. Let's see the elements around them:\n\nPosition7: 8. Adjacent elements are position6 (0), position8 (1). So the 1 at position8 would become 3.\n\nPosition9:8. Adjacent elements are position8 (1) and position10 (8). So position8 is 1, which is adjacent to 8 at9. So position8 becomes 3. But position10 is 8, which doesn't affect.\n\nPosition10:8. Adjacent elements are position9 (8) and position11 (1). So position11 becomes3.\n\nPosition12:8. Adjacent elements are position11 (1) and position13 (0). So position11 becomes3.\n\nSo in this row, the 1s at positions8,8 (from position7 and 9?), wait, let's list all the 1s adjacent to 8s:\n\nLooking at the row:\n\nIndices: 0:0, 1:0, 2:1, 3:0, 4:0, 5:1, 6:0, 7:8, 8:1, 9:8, 10:8, 11:1, 12:8, 13:0, 14:1, 15:0, 16:0.\n\nNow, for each 8 in the row:\n\nAt 7: check left (6 is 0) and right (8 is 1). So 8 at 7: right is 1 (pos8) \u2192 becomes3.\n\nAt 9: left is pos8 (now 3?), but in input it's 1. Wait, the transformation is done per row, so the original input is processed. So for each 8 in the row, we check left and right in the original input. So for 9, left is 8 (pos8 is 1 in input). So pos8 (1) is adjacent to 8 at pos7 and 9. So in the original input, the 1 at pos8 is adjacent to 8 at7 and 9. So both would cause it to become3.\n\nSimilarly, 8 at pos9: left is 8 (pos9's left is pos8, which is1 in input, but the 8 is at9. So left is pos8 (1), which becomes3. Right is pos10 (8).\n\nAt pos10:8. Left is pos9 (8), right is pos11 (1). So pos11 (1) becomes3.\n\nAt pos12:8. Left is pos11 (1), right is pos13 (0). So pos11 (1) becomes3.\n\nSo the 1s at positions8,11 would be replaced with3. But wait, pos8 is 1, adjacent to 8 at7 and9. So pos8 becomes3. pos11 is1, adjacent to 8 at10 and12. So pos11 becomes3. So the transformed row would have 3s at positions8 and11.\n\nSo the output line11 would be [0,0,1,0,0,1,0,8,3,8,8,3,8,0,1,0,0].\n\nBut let's check other examples. For instance, line12 in test input:\n\n[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nThe 8s are at positions7,8,10,11. Let's check their adjacent elements.\n\nPos7:8. Left is6 (1), right is8 (8). So left is1 \u2192 becomes3.\n\nPos8:8. Left is7 (8), right is9 (1). So right is1 \u2192 becomes3.\n\nPos10:8. Left is9 (1), right is11 (8). Left is1 \u2192 becomes3.\n\nPos11:8. Left is10 (8), right is12 (1). Right is1 \u2192 becomes3.\n\nSo the 1s at positions6,9,12 would become3. So line12 in output would be [1,0,0,1,0,0,3,8,8,3,8,8,3,0,0,1,0].\n\nSimilarly, line13:\n\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nLooking for 8s at positions8,9,11,12.\n\nPos8:8. Left is7 (1), right is9 (8). Left is1 \u2192 becomes3.\n\nPos9:8. Left is8 (8), right is10 (1). Right is1 \u2192 becomes3.\n\nPos11:8. Left is10 (1), right is12 (8). Left is1 \u2192 becomes3.\n\nPos12:8. Left is11 (8), right is13 (1). Right is1 \u2192 becomes3.\n\nSo the 1s at positions7,10,13 become3. So line13 becomes [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,8,8,3,8,8,3,0,0,1].\n\nLine14 in test input:\n\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nThis is similar to line11. The 8s are at7,9,10,12.\n\nPos7:8 \u2192 right is8 (pos8 is1 \u2192 becomes3).\n\nPos9:8 \u2192 left is8 (pos8 is1 \u2192 becomes3), right is10 (8).\n\nPos10:8 \u2192 left is9 (8), right is11 (1 \u2192 becomes3).\n\nPos12:8 \u2192 left is11 (1 \u2192 becomes3), right is13 (0).\n\nSo 1s at pos8 and 11 \u21923. So line14 becomes [0,0,1,0,0,1,0,8,3,8,8,3,8,0,1,0,0].\n\nNow, applying this transformation to all rows of the test input. The other rows (those without 8s) remain unchanged. So the test output will have the same rows as the input except for the rows that have 8s (lines11,12,13,14), which will have their 1s adjacent to 8s replaced with3.\n\nSo let's write out the transformed rows:\n\nOriginal line11: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nTransformed line11: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nOriginal line12: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nTransformed line12: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nOriginal line13: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nTransformed line13: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 1]\n\nOriginal line14: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nTransformed line14: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nThe rest of the lines in the test input don't have 8s, so they remain the same.\n\nSo the final output for the test input should have the transformed lines as above, with the 1s adjacent to 8s replaced by 3s in lines 11-14, and the rest unchanged.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples provided. Then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the training examples to see what's changing. Let's start with Example 0. The input has several rows with 0s, 1s, and 8s. The output seems to replace some 1s and 8s with 3s. Let me compare specific rows.\n\nLooking at the third input row in Example 0: [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]. The output becomes [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]. So the 1s around the 8 are turned into 3s. Specifically, positions 5,6,8,9 (0-indexed) are changed. It looks like whenever there's an 8, the adjacent 1s (maybe both left and right) are converted to 3s. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input row [1, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0] becomes [1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. So the 1 next to the first 8 (position 2) becomes a 3. Similarly, the next row has 1s that turn into 3s adjacent to 8s. It seems like whenever a 1 is adjacent (either left or right?) to an 8, it's replaced by a 3. But maybe it's in specific positions relative to the 8.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input row [1, 0, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0] becomes [1, 0, 1, 1, 8, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Here, the 1s next to 8s (positions 5,6,8) are turned into 3s. So the pattern might be that any 1 that is adjacent (immediately next to) an 8 is replaced by a 3. But wait, in Example 0, the 8 is in position 7 of the third input row. The 1s at positions 5 and 6 (to the left of the 8) and 8 and 9 (to the right) are replaced. Wait, but the 8 is at position 7, so positions 5,6 are two left, and 8,9 are right. Hmm, maybe not adjacent but in a certain range.\n\nWait, let's look again. In Example 0's third input row (input row index 3, which is the fourth line in the input), the row is [1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1]. The output is [1,1,1,0,1,3,3,8,3,3,1,0,1,1,1,0,1]. The 8 is at position 7. The positions 5,6 (before 8) and 8,9 (after 8) are changed to 3. So the 8 is at position 7. The 1s in positions 5,6 (two positions before the 8) and 8,9 (two positions after) are replaced. Wait, but that's two positions before and after. Wait, maybe it's a window around the 8. For example, in a 5-element window centered at the 8, the two on each side. Let's see: positions 5,6,7 (8),8,9. So positions 5,6 (before), 8,9 (after) are 1s, which turn into 3s. So maybe the rule is that in each row, whenever there's an 8, the two elements before and two elements after the 8 that are 1s are replaced by 3s. But that doesn't fit all examples. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input row [0, 8, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So the 8s are at positions 1,3,6,7. Let's look at the first 8 at position 1. The next element is 1 (position 2), which becomes 3. Then, the 8 at position 3: the elements before are position 2 (3, which was changed earlier), and after (position4:1 becomes 3). The 8 at position6: elements after are positions7 (8, no change), and before is position5 (1 becomes 3). Hmm, maybe the rule is that any 1 immediately adjacent (left or right) to an 8 becomes a 3. But in the first case, the 8 is at position1, and the next element (position2) is 1, which becomes 3. The 8 at position3 has a 1 at position4, which becomes 3. Similarly, the 8 at position6 has a 1 at position5, which becomes 3. Wait, but in the first example, the 8 at position7 has 1s at positions5,6 (left two positions) and 8,9 (right two positions). That seems inconsistent. Maybe the rule is that any 1 in the same row that is adjacent (either left or right) to an 8 is replaced by 3. But then in the first example, why are positions5 and6 changed when the 8 is at position7. Position6 is adjacent (left) to position7 (8), so that 1 is replaced. Then position5 is adjacent to position6 (now 3), but that doesn't explain. Wait, maybe it's that all 1s in the row that are adjacent to any 8, but in the first example, the 8 is at position7, so the 1s at positions6 and 8 (directly adjacent) would be replaced. But in the output, positions5,6,8,9 are replaced. So maybe there's a step where after replacing adjacent 1s, the new 3s are also checked? Like a chain reaction. Let me see:\n\nIn the input row [1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1], the 8 is at position7. The immediate left is position6 (1) and right is position8 (1). So those become 3. But in the output, positions5,6,8,9 are 3. So position5 is two left from the 8, and position9 is two right. So maybe the rule is that any 1 within two positions of an 8 (either left or right) is replaced by 3. So for each 8, check two to the left and two to the right. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's row with 8 at position7, positions5 (two left), 6 (one left), 8 (one right), 9 (two right) are changed. So that would explain the four 3s around the 8.\n\nIn Example1's row [0,8,1,8,1,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0], the 8s are at positions1,3,6,7. For position1 (8), two to the right would be positions2 and3. So position2 (1) becomes 3. But position3 is 8, so no change. For position3 (8), two left is position1 and 2 (8 and3), two right is position4 and5 (1 and1). So positions4 and5 become 3. For position6 (8), two left is 4 and5 (now 3s), two right is7 (8) and8 (8). So no new changes. Position7 (8) has two right as8 and9 (0). So in this case, the output has 3s at positions2,4,5. Which matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for every 8 in a row, replace the 1s in the two positions immediately to the left and the two positions immediately to the right of the 8 with 3s. However, if those positions are beyond the start or end of the list, they are ignored. Also, if the positions are already 8 or 3, they stay the same. So the transformation is: scan each row, for each 8 found, look at the two positions before and after it, and any 1s in those positions are turned into 3s.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's look at the test input:\n\nThe test input has several rows, but the key rows where 8s appear are the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th rows (0-based index 11,12,13,14). Let's check each of these.\n\nTest Input Row 11 (index 11):\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nThe 8s are at positions7,9,10,12. Let's process each 8.\n\nFor position7 (8):\nCheck positions5,6 (left two) and 8,9 (right two). Position5 is 1, position6 is 0. So position5 is 1 \u2192 becomes 3. Right two: positions8 and9. Position8 is 1 \u2192 3, position9 is 8 (no change). So after this 8, positions5 and8 are changed to 3.\n\nFor position9 (8):\nLeft two: positions7 and8 (8 and3), right two: positions10 and11 (8 and1). Position10 is 8 (no change), position11 is1 \u21923.\n\nFor position10 (8):\nLeft two: positions8 and9 (3 and8), right two: positions11 and12 (3 and8). Position11 is1 \u21923 (but already handled by position9's processing?), but maybe in this case, we need to process all 8s and their surrounding positions regardless of order.\n\nFor position12 (8):\nLeft two: positions10 and11 (8 and3), right two: positions13 and14 (0 and1). Position14 is1 \u21923.\n\nSo after processing all 8s in this row:\n\nOriginal: 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0\n\nAfter 8 at position7:\n- pos5 (1 \u21923)\n- pos8 (1\u21923)\nResult so far: [0,0,1,0,0,3,0,8,3,8,8,1,8,0,1,0,0]\n\nNext, 8 at pos9:\n- left two: pos7 and8 (8 and3) \u2192 no 1s\n- right two: pos10 (8), pos11 (1\u21923)\nSo pos11 becomes 3.\n\nNow: ... pos11 is3.\n\nNext, 8 at pos10:\n- left two: pos8 (3), pos9 (8)\n- right two: pos11 (3), pos12 (8)\nNo 1s to change.\n\n8 at pos12:\n- left two: pos10 (8), pos11 (3)\n- right two: pos13 (0), pos14 (1\u21923)\nSo pos14 becomes3.\n\nSo final row after processing 8s would be:\n[0,0,1,0,0,3,0,8,3,8,8,3,8,0,3,0,0]\n\nWait, but let's see the original row:\n\nOriginal: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nAfter processing 8 at position7:\n- positions5 (1\u21923) and8 (1\u21923)\nSo positions5 and8 are now 3.\n\nThen 8 at position9:\n- positions7 (8) and8 (3) \u2192 left two, no 1s.\n- positions10 (8) and11 (1\u21923). So position11 becomes3.\n\nThen 8 at position10:\n- positions8 (3) and9 (8) \u2192 left two, no 1s.\n- positions11 (3) and12 (8) \u2192 no 1s.\n\nThen 8 at position12:\n- positions10 (8) and11 (3) \u2192 left two.\n- positions13 (0) and14 (1\u21923). So position14 becomes3.\n\nSo the resulting row would be:\n\n[0,0,1,0,0,3,0,8,3,8,8,3,8,0,3,0,0]\n\nBut let's check the next rows:\n\nTest Input Row12 (index12):\n[1,0,0,1,0,0,1,8,8,1,8,8,1,0,0,1,0]\n8s at positions7,8,10,11.\n\nProcessing each 8:\n\nFor 8 at7:\nleft two:5,6 (0 and1) \u2192 position6 is1\u21923.\nright two:8,9 (8 and1) \u2192 position9 is1\u21923.\n\nFor 8 at8:\nleft two:6,7 (3 and8) \u2192 no 1s.\nright two:9,10 (3 and8) \u2192 no 1s.\n\nFor 8 at10:\nleft two:8,9 (8 and3) \u2192 no 1s.\nright two:11,12 (8 and1) \u2192 position12 is1\u21923.\n\nFor 8 at11:\nleft two:9,10 (3 and8) \u2192 no 1s.\nright two:12,13 (3 and0) \u2192 position12 is1\u21923 (already done).\n\nSo original row:\n\n[1,0,0,1,0,0,1,8,8,1,8,8,1,0,0,1,0]\n\nAfter 8 at7:\n- pos6 (1\u21923)\n- pos9 (1\u21923)\nResult so far: [1,0,0,1,0,0,3,8,8,3,8,8,1,0,0,1,0]\n\nNext, 8 at8:\nNo changes.\n\n8 at10:\n- right two:11 and12 (8 and1) \u2192 pos12 becomes3.\n\nResult: [1,0,0,1,0,0,3,8,8,3,8,8,3,0,0,1,0]\n\n8 at11: no changes.\n\nSo final row12 would be [1,0,0,1,0,0,3,8,8,3,8,8,3,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow13 (index13):\n\n[0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,8,8,1,8,8,1,0,0,1]\n\n8s at positions8,9,11,12.\n\nProcessing each 8:\n\n8 at8:\nleft two:6,7 (0 and1). position7 (1\u21923.\nright two:9,10 (8 and1). position10 (1\u21923.\n\n8 at9:\nleft two:7,8 (3 and8) \u2192 no 1s.\nright two:10,11 (3 and8) \u2192 no 1s.\n\n8 at11:\nleft two:9,10 (8 and3) \u2192 no 1s.\nright two:12,13 (8 and1). position13 (1\u21923.\n\n8 at12:\nleft two:10,11 (3 and8) \u2192 no 1s.\nright two:13,14 (3 and0) \u2192 no 1s.\n\nOriginal row: [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,8,8,1,8,8,1,0,0,1]\n\nAfter 8 at8:\n- pos7 (1\u21923)\n- pos10 (1\u21923)\nSo row becomes: [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,8,8,3,8,8,1,0,0,1]\n\n8 at11:\n- pos13 (1\u21923)\nResult: [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,8,8,3,8,8,3,0,0,1]\n\nRow14 (index14):\n\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nThis is similar to row11 but let's process.\n\n8s at7,9,10,12.\n\nProcessing each 8:\n\n8 at7:\nleft two:5,6 (1 and0). pos5 (1\u21923.\nright two:8,9 (1 and8). pos8 (1\u21923.\n\n8 at9:\nleft two:7,8 (8 and3) \u2192 no 1s.\nright two:10,11 (8 and1). pos11 (1\u21923.\n\n8 at10:\nleft two:8,9 (3 and8) \u2192 no 1s.\nright two:11,12 (3 and8) \u2192 no 1s.\n\n8 at12:\nleft two:10,11 (8 and3) \u2192 no 1s.\nright two:13,14 (0 and1). pos14 (1\u21923.\n\nOriginal row: [0,0,1,0,0,1,0,8,1,8,8,1,8,0,1,0,0]\n\nAfter 8 at7:\n- pos5 (1\u21923)\n- pos8 (1\u21923)\nRow becomes: [0,0,1,0,0,3,0,8,3,8,8,1,8,0,1,0,0]\n\n8 at9:\n- pos11 (1\u21923)\nRow becomes: [0,0,1,0,0,3,0,8,3,8,8,3,8,0,1,0,0]\n\n8 at12:\n- pos14 (1\u21923)\nRow becomes: [0,0,1,0,0,3,0,8,3,8,8,3,8,0,3,0,0]\n\nNow, for the other rows in the test input that don't have 8s, they should remain unchanged because the transformation only affects rows with 8s. So rows 0-10, 15-16 have no 8s and thus no changes.\n\nPutting it all together, the output for the test input would have the modified rows as discussed and the rest unchanged.",
