        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. Hmm, the input and output examples seem to be lists of lists, like grids. Let me look at the training examples first to find the pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some 8s and 2s. The output seems to expand those 8s in some way. Looking at the input's first row: [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0]. The output rows below repeat this pattern but maybe shifted. Oh, wait, the 8s are propagating downwards but with a shift. Like, the next rows after the first have 8s that are shifted to the right each time? Or maybe it's following some diagonal pattern. Also, the 2s in the input rows (like row 4 and 10) might be acting as some kind of markers where the 8s start to shift. Let me check the output for that.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the row with 2 (row 4) becomes [2,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. So the 2 is followed by 8s that start at position 2. Then the next rows under that have 8s shifted further. It looks like each 2 in the input causes the 8s to start a new diagonal. So maybe the 2s are like anchors that create a new set of 8s flowing diagonally down and to the right.\n\nExample 1's input has 8s in the first row at positions 2 and 6. The output shows those 8s propagating down and shifting. Also, there are 2s in rows 3, 7, 11. The output for row 3 becomes [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,2], so maybe the 2 here starts a new wave of 8s. Then in row 7, it's [8,0,0,0,8,...], which seems like the 8s shifted left perhaps? Or maybe the direction changes based on the position of the 2.\n\nExample 2 is a bit different. The input has 8s scattered in rows 2, 6, 9, and a 2 in row 11. The output fills certain rows with blocks of 8s. For example, the first output row becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8]. Then next rows have 8s in different positions. It looks like the 8s are grouped into blocks of four, and each subsequent set of rows shifts their position. The 2s here might indicate where these blocks start or how they shift.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern might involve propagating 8s from their original positions in the input, but shifting their positions in subsequent rows. The 2s might act as triggers for creating new lines of 8s that start at a certain position and then continue shifting. The direction of the shift (left, right, or diagonal) could depend on the position of the 2 or the original 8s.\n\nLooking at the test input. The input has 8s in rows 2, 5, 8, 10, all at the last position (index 16). The 2s are in row 11 at positions 2, 6, 11. So maybe each 2 in the input row 11 will cause a new set of 8s to propagate upwards or downwards from that position, following some pattern. But how?\n\nIn Example 2, the 8s in the input are in rows 2,6,9, and the output creates blocks of 8s every few rows. The 2s in the input are in row 11. The output's last row keeps the 2s but adds 8s in the upper rows. So perhaps each 8 in the input starts a block of 8s that repeat every few rows, with the blocks shifting each time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are \"sources\" that generate a diagonal line of 8s moving in a certain direction. For example, in Example 0, the first row's 8s create diagonals moving down to the right. Each 2 then starts a new diagonal. So the 2s in the input could be points where new diagonals of 8s start, possibly shifted from the original 8s.\n\nIn the test input, the 8s are all in the last column (index 16) of rows 2,5,8,10. The 2s are in row 11 at columns 2,6,11. Maybe each 8 in column 16 will generate 8s moving diagonally upwards to the left. For example, the 8 in row 2, column 16 would create 8s in row 1, column 15; row 0, column 14; but since there are no more rows above, maybe they wrap or just start from there. Alternatively, the 8s propagate downward and to the left. Wait, in Example 0, the 8s in the first row's columns 1,5,7,9. The output rows below start having 8s shifted to the right, then the 2 in row4 starts a new diagonal. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 0's input again. The first row has 8s at positions 1,5,7,9. The output's next rows (rows 1-3) are copies of the first row. Then row4 starts with a 2, followed by 8s at positions 2,6,8,10. Then rows 5-9 have those 8s shifted again. Then row10 starts with a 2 and 8s at positions 3,7,9,11. So it seems each time a 2 is encountered, the 8s from the previous block are shifted one position to the right and start from there. So the 2s are markers where the 8s shift right and start a new diagonal.\n\nIn the test input, the 2s are in row11, columns 2,6,11. So perhaps each 2 in this row will create a new diagonal of 8s starting from their position. For example, the 2 at column2 in row11 would start 8s moving upward, each row above having 8s shifted to the left? Or maybe each 2 creates a vertical line of 8s upward from their position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Example 2, the output has blocks of four 8s that shift in each subsequent group of rows. The test input's 8s are in the last column. Maybe each 8 in the input's last column will generate a block of 8s moving leftward in groups. For example, the 8 in row2, column16 would create a block starting at row2, columns 16-13 (but the output has 4 8s), but since the row is shorter, maybe they wrap around or something. Wait, in Example 2's output, the first three rows have blocks of 8s in different positions. Row0 ends with 8s at positions 8-11. Row1 has 8s at positions 4-7. Row2 has 8s at 0-3. Then the pattern repeats. So it's like each group of three rows has the 8s blocks moving left each time. Then for the test input, maybe the 8s in the last column (16) would create blocks moving left, four 8s each, but since the row length is 17, maybe each block of four 8s starts at column16 and moves left. But how?\n\nWait, the test input's rows are length 17. For example, the first row is [0,0,...,0] (17 elements). The 8s are in the last column (index 16) of rows 2,5,8,10. So perhaps each of these 8s will generate a block of four 8s starting from their position and moving left. For example, row2, column16 would have 8s in columns16,15,14,13. Then the next rows (like row3) would have 8s in columns15,14,13,12, and so on. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are the start of a diagonal line of 8s moving down and to the left. So each 8 in row2, column16 would create 8s in row3, column15; row4, column14, etc. But looking at Example 0, the 8s in the first row (row0) are at positions1,5,7,9. The output rows1-3 are copies. Then row4 starts with a 2, followed by 8s at positions2,6,8,10. So the 8s are shifted right by 1 from the original. Then row10's 2 leads to 8s at positions3,7,9,11. So each 2 introduces a shift to the right by 1. So the 2s are acting as step points where the 8s shift.\n\nIn the test input, there are 2s in row11. Since this is the last row, maybe the 8s from the 2s start propagating upwards. For example, each 2 in row11, column2 would generate 8s in row10, column3; row9, column4; etc., moving up and to the right. Similarly, the 2 at column6 in row11 would generate 8s moving up and to the right. And the 2 at column11 would start at row11, column11, then row10, column12, etc. But since the row has length17, columns go up to16.\n\nLet me try to model this. The 2s in row11, columns2,6,11. Each 2 would generate a diagonal line of 8s going upwards, each step moving right by1. So for the 2 at (row11, col2):\n\nRow11: 2 at col2, but in output, maybe replace the 2 with 8s starting there. Wait, in Example 0, the 2 is kept and followed by 8s. So the 2s remain, and the 8s start after them. So for the test input's row11: [0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. The output would replace each 2 with 8s starting from that position, but how?\n\nAlternatively, each 2 in a row causes the next rows to start a new set of 8s shifted by a certain amount. Let's think of the test input's 8s in the last column. Each of those 8s in rows2,5,8,10 could be generating their own diagonals. For example, the 8 in row2, column16 would generate 8s in row3, column15; row4, column14; etc., moving down and left. But the output for Example0 has the 8s propagating downward with shifts to the right. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output for each input row is determined by looking at the row above and applying some transformation. Like, each 8 in a row is copied down and shifted. For example, in Example0, the first row has 8s. The next three rows are copies. Then when a row with a 2 is encountered, the 8s shift right by1. So each time a 2 is in a row, the 8s in subsequent rows start shifting right.\n\nIn the test input, the 2s are in row11. So maybe starting from row11, each 2 introduces a new shift. But since row11 is near the end, how does that affect the rows above? Or maybe the 2s in row11 cause shifts in the rows below, but there are no rows below. Alternatively, maybe the 2s in row11 are in the same position as in the input, and the 8s are generated upwards from there.\n\nWait, looking at Example1's input: the first row has 8s at positions2 and6. The output for rows1-2 are copies. Then in row3 (which has a 2 in the last column), the 8s shift to positions1 and5. Then rows4-6 have those 8s. Then row7 (which has a 2 in column9) shifts the 8s to the left, perhaps? The output row7 becomes [8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,2], so 8s at positions0 and4. Then rows8-10 have those. Then row11 (with a 2 in column9) shifts again, 8s at position3. So each 2 causes a shift in the direction of the 8s. The shifts alternate between left and right? Or based on the position of the 2.\n\nIn Example1, the first 2 is in row3, column9. The previous 8s were at positions2 and6. After the 2, they shift to positions1 and5. Then the next 2 in row7, column9 shifts them again to positions0 and4. The next 2 in row11, column9 shifts them to position3. So each 2 causes a leftward shift by1 for the 8s.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: whenever there's a 2 in a row, the 8s in subsequent rows shift left by1 (or right, depending on context). Alternatively, the shift direction is determined by the position of the 2.\n\nIn the test input, the 2s are in row11, columns2,6,11. Each of these might cause a shift in the 8s. But how do the existing 8s in the input (at column16) relate to this?\n\nThe input has 8s in rows2,5,8,10, all at column16. The output for these might be that each of these 8s starts a diagonal of 8s moving down and to the left. So row2, col16 \u2192 row3, col15; row4, col14; etc. Then, the 2s in row11 could start new diagonals moving up and to the right. For example, the 2 at row11, col2 would generate 8s in row10, col3; row9, col4; etc.\n\nBut how to combine all these? Let's try to model the test input's output.\n\nThe test input's 8s are in the last column (16) of rows2,5,8,10. Each of these could generate a diagonal line moving down-left. However, since the input's rows are 12 (0-11), rows beyond 11 don't exist. So row2's 8 at col16 would generate:\n\nRow2: 8 at 16\n\nRow3: 8 at 15\n\nRow4: 8 at14\n\nRow5: 8 at13 (but row5 has an 8 at16, which might override this?)\n\nWait, maybe not. The input's 8s are sources that generate their own diagonals. So the existing 8s in the input are part of the output, and their diagonals are added. For example, row2's 8 in col16 would have 8s at col16 in row2, 15 in row3, 14 in row4, etc., down to row11, col6 (since 16 - (11-2) = 16-9=7, but maybe I'm miscalculating).\n\nBut the 2s in row11 might be generating diagonals upwards. For example, the 2 at row11, col2 would generate 8s at row10, col3; row9, col4; etc. Similarly for the other 2s.\n\nSo combining all these, the output would have diagonals from the input 8s and the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s act as starting points for new 8s that propagate upward. Each 2 in row11, col x would create 8s in row10, x+1; row9, x+2; etc., up to row0. For example, the 2 at row11, col2:\n\nRow11: 2 at col2 \u2192 but in the output, perhaps replace 2 with 8? Or keep the 2 and add 8s.\n\nWait in Example0 and Example1, the 2s remain in the output rows. For instance, in Example0's row4 is [2,0,8,0,...], so the 2 is kept. So the 2s in the input are retained in the output. So the test input's row11 will keep the 2s at cols2,6,11. Then, starting from those 2s, generate 8s moving upward, each time shifted right by1 column per row.\n\nSo the 2 at row11, col2 would generate 8s in row10, col3; row9, col4; row8, col5; etc. Similarly, the 2 at row11, col6 would generate 8s at row10, col7; row9, col8; etc. The 2 at row11, col11 would generate 8s at row10, col12; row9, col13; etc.\n\nAdditionally, the existing 8s in the input (rows2,5,8,10, col16) would generate their own diagonals. For example, the 8 at row2, col16 would generate 8s in row3, col15; row4, col14; row5, col13; row6, col12; row7, col11; row8, col10; row9, col9; row10, col8; row11, col7. But row5 has another 8 at col16. So this would create a conflict. Wait, perhaps each 8 generates a diagonal, but overlapping ones just add up. So in row5, col16 is an input 8, so it would generate a diagonal from row5: col16 \u2192 row6,15; row7,14; etc.\n\nBut this could get complex. Let's try to apply this to the test input.\n\nFirst, handle the input 8s:\n\n- row2, col16: diagonal down-left \u2192 each next row, column decreases by1.\n\nSo row2: 16 \u2192 row3:15, row4:14, ..., up to row11:16-9=7. So row11, col7.\n\nSimilarly, row5, col16: row6:15, row7:14, ..., row11:16-6=10 (since 5 to11 is 6 steps: 16-6=10). So row11, col10.\n\nRow8, col16: row9:15, row10:14, row11:13.\n\nRow10, col16: row11:15.\n\nSo in row11, we have 8s at cols7,10,13,15 (from the input 8s' diagonals), plus the existing 2s.\n\nBut the output also needs to incorporate the diagonals from the 2s.\n\nThe 2s in row11:\n\n- 2 at col2: starts diagonal up-right. So row11, col2 \u2192 row10, col3 \u2192 row9, col4 \u2192 ... up to row0, col13.\n\n- 2 at col6: row11, col6 \u2192 row10,7 \u2192 row9,8 \u2192 ... up to row0,17 (which doesn't exist, so stops at col16).\n\n- 2 at col11: row11, col11 \u2192 row10,12 \u2192 row9,13 \u2192 row8,14 \u2192 ... up to row0,22 (invalid, so stop at col16).\n\nSo these diagonals would add 8s to various positions.\n\nPutting all this together, the output rows would have 8s from both the input's original 8s and the diagonals generated by the 2s.\n\nBut how do the training examples handle overlapping 8s and 2s? In Example0, the 2s are in rows4 and10, and the output rows have the 2 followed by 8s. So the 2s are preserved and followed by the generated 8s.\n\nFor the test input's row11, the 2s are present, and the generated 8s from their diagonals are in the rows above. So row11 would have the 2s, but the 8s generated from the 2s are in the rows above (row10,9, etc.).\n\nAdditionally, the input's 8s generate their own diagonals in the lower rows.\n\nThis is getting quite complicated. Let's look for a pattern that can be generalized.\n\nAlternative approach: In the examples, the output seems to create multiple diagonal lines of 8s, each starting from the input's 8s and 2s. Each 2 introduces a new diagonal line. The direction of the diagonal might depend on the position of the 2 or the original 8.\n\nIn Example0, the first four output rows are copies of the input's first row. Then, after the 2 in row4, the 8s shift to the right. Similarly, after the 2 in row10, another shift occurs. So the 2s are markers where the 8s shift right by one and continue downward.\n\nIn Example1, the 2s cause the 8s to shift left. For example, the first 2 in row3's last column causes the 8s to shift left by one in subsequent rows. Then another shift left after the next 2, etc.\n\nIn Example2, the 8s are arranged in blocks that shift left every three rows. The 2s in row11 are preserved, and the 8s form a pattern that cycles through positions.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern seems to involve propagating the 8s in a certain direction (left, right, or down) whenever a 2 is encountered. The 2 acts as a pivot point for changing the direction or shift of the 8s.\n\nFor the test input, since there are multiple 2s in row11, each would start a new diagonal of 8s going upward and to the right. The existing 8s in the last column would generate diagonals going downward and to the left.\n\nBut how to represent this in the output?\n\nLet's try to model the test input step by step.\n\nOriginal input has 8s in rows2,5,8,10 at column16. Each of these would create a diagonal line going down and left:\n\nFor row2, col16:\n\n- row2:16\n\n- row3:15\n\n- row4:14\n\n- row5:13\n\n- row6:12\n\n- row7:11\n\n- row8:10\n\n- row9:9\n\n- row10:8\n\n- row11:7\n\nSo in row11, col7 has an 8 from this diagonal.\n\nFor row5, col16:\n\n- row5:16\n\n- row6:15\n\n- row7:14\n\n- row8:13\n\n- row9:12\n\n- row10:11\n\n- row11:10\n\nSo row11, col10 has an 8 from this diagonal.\n\nRow8, col16:\n\n- row8:16\n\n- row9:15\n\n- row10:14\n\n- row11:13\n\nSo row11, col13.\n\nRow10, col16:\n\n- row10:16\n\n- row11:15\n\nSo row11, col15.\n\nSo in row11, the 8s from the input diagonals are at cols7,10,13,15. But the original row11 has 2s at cols2,6,11. So in the output row11, these 2s remain, and the 8s from the diagonals are added.\n\nNow, the 2s in row11 start their own diagonals going upward, each step to the right.\n\nFor each 2 in row11:\n\n- 2 at col2: generates 8s in row10, col3; row9, col4; row8, col5; ... up to row0.\n\n- 2 at col6: generates 8s in row10, col7; row9, col8; ... \n\n- 2 at col11: generates 8s in row10, col12; row9, col13; ... \n\nThese diagonals would add 8s in the rows above row11.\n\nAdditionally, the input's 8s in rows2,5,8,10 have their own diagonals in the rows below, but since those are already in the input, perhaps they continue downward as well. However, the test input has rows up to row11, so there's nowhere else to go.\n\nPutting all this together, the output for each row would include:\n\n- The original 8s and 2s.\n\n- The diagonals from the input 8s.\n\n- The diagonals from the 2s in row11.\n\nSo let's construct the output rows.\n\nStarting with row0:\n\n- Original input has no 8s or 2s. But the diagonals from the 2s in row11 would reach here.\n\nFor example, the 2 at row11, col2's diagonal reaches row0, col2 + (11-0) = col13. So row0, col13 would have an 8.\n\nSimilarly, the 2 at row11, col6's diagonal reaches row0, col6+11=17, which is beyond the 17 columns (0-16). So stops at col16.\n\nThe 2 at row11, col11's diagonal would reach row0, col11+11=22 \u2192 col16 (max).\n\nSo row0 would have 8s at cols13 (from 2 at col2), cols17-11=6+11=17\u219216 (from 2 at col6), and 11+11=22\u219216 (from 2 at col11). So cols13 and16.\n\nBut how many steps each diagonal has:\n\nThe 2 at col2 in row11 would generate 8s in row10 (col3), row9 (col4), ..., row0 (col2+11=13). So row0, col13.\n\nThe 2 at col6: row10 (7), row9 (8), ..., row0 (6+11=17\u219216).\n\nThe 2 at col11: row10 (12), row9 (13), row8 (14), row7 (15), row6 (16), row5 (17\u219216). So from row11 to row5, col16.\n\nSo row5 would have an 8 at col16 from this diagonal, but the original input also has an 8 at row5, col16. So they overlap.\n\nSo row0 would have 8s at 13,16,16 (but duplicates are fine).\n\nWait, but each diagonal step from the 2s starts at row11 and moves up. For example, 2 at row11, col2:\n\nRow11: col2 (2 is here, but no 8 yet)\n\nRow10: col3\n\nRow9: col4\n\n...\n\nRow0: col13\n\nSo in row0, col13 would have an 8 from this diagonal.\n\nSimilarly, the 2 at col6 in row11:\n\nRow10:7, row9:8,... row0:6+11=17 \u2192 16.\n\nSo row0, col16.\n\nThe 2 at col11 in row11:\n\nRow10:12, row9:13, row8:14, row7:15, row6:16, rows5 and below would be 17\u219216.\n\nSo row6, col16.\n\nSo in row0, only col13 and16 (from the 2s) and any from the input's 8s.\n\nBut the input's 8s are in rows2,5,8,10, col16. Their diagonals are downward, but since the test input's rows are up to row11, those diagonals are already covered in the input's rows.\n\nNow, considering the output rows:\n\nRow0: 8s from the 2's diagonals (col13,16).\n\nRow1: 8s from the same diagonals (col12,15).\n\nRow2: 8s from diagonals (col11,14) plus the original 8 in col16.\n\nRow3: 8s from diagonals (col10,13) plus the diagonal from row2's 8 (col15).\n\nThis is getting very complicated. Maybe the output should have for each row, the original elements plus the 8s generated by the diagonals from both the input 8s and the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each 2 introduces a new set of 8s that start at the 2's position and then move up and to the right. Each input 8 generates a diagonal moving down and to the left.\n\nBut combining all of this into the output is quite involved. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the pattern is that each 2 in a row causes the previous 8s to shift right (or left) and start a new diagonal, and the input 8s are propagated down and shifted based on the 2s.\n\nIn the test input, since the 2s are all in the last row (row11), their effect would be to create new 8s that start at their positions and move upwards and to the right. The input 8s would create 8s moving downwards and to the left.\n\nSo for each row in the output:\n\n- For rows above row11, the 8s from the 2s' diagonals would appear.\n\n- For rows below the input 8s (which don't exist in this case), nothing.\n\nBut since the test input's rows are from 0 to11, the 8s from the input's 8s would be in rows2,5,8,10, and their diagonals would be in rows3-11 for row2's 8, rows6-11 for row5's 8, etc.\n\nAdditionally, the 2s in row11 would generate 8s upwards in rows10,9,...0.\n\nPutting this all together, the output would have a lot of 8s in various positions, especially in the lower rows from the input 8s and the upper rows from the 2s.\n\nBut given the examples, especially Example2, where the output has blocks of 8s that shift every few rows, maybe the test input's output will have similar blocks. However, without more examples, it's hard to be certain.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the safest way is to look for how the 2s and 8s in the input are positioned and how they propagate in the examples, then replicate that pattern.\n\nIn Example0, the 2s are in rows4 and10, and the output after each 2 starts a new shifted set of 8s. Similarly, the test input's 2s are in row11. So perhaps each 2 in row11 starts a new set of 8s shifted right by their position.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 2s in a row determines the number of new shifts. For example, three 2s in row11 would start three new shifts.\n\nBut the output examples show that the number of 8s increases in each new shifted block. So for the test input, each 2 in row11 would cause a new shift in the rows above.\n\nGiven that, the final answer would have the 2s in row11 and the 8s generated by their diagonals upwards, plus the 8s from the input's original 8s and their diagonals.\n\nAfter considering all this, I think the best approach is to generate the output by propagating each 8 and 2 into their respective diagonals, then combine them. But due to time constraints and the complexity, I'll proceed to draft the output based on the patterns observed.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the training examples and determine how the input is transformed into the output, then apply that to the test input. \n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input has a row [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0], and the output rows below it are copies of that first row for the first four lines. Then in row 4 of the input, there's a 2, and in the output, the 2 remains, but after that, starting from index 2, there are 8s every third position? Wait, let me check again.\n\nInput row 4 is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output row 4 becomes [2,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. Hmm. So maybe the 2 is kept, and then starting from position 2, inserting 8s with some interval. Like, after the 2, every two zeros? Or maybe it's a shift. Wait, maybe the 8s from the first row are being propagated downward in some way. Let me see the other rows.\n\nIn Example 0, the first four output rows are copies of the first input row. Then, starting from the row with the 2 (row 4), the 8s start to shift to the right as we go down. Like, the first four rows are the same, then the next set of rows (starting at row 4) have 8s shifted right by one each time. Wait, looking at the output:\n\nRow 4: [2,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\nRow 5: [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\nWait, no, row 5 is same as row 4 except the first element is 0 instead of 2. So maybe the 2 is in the same column, and the 8s are being shifted in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s from the first row are moving down and to the right, but only when there's a 2 in the column. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 in the last element of row 3. The output for that row becomes [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,2]. So the 2 is preserved, but 8s are added in the row. The input's first row is [0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0], and the output first three rows are copies. Then row 3 in output starts with 0,8,0... So maybe the 8s are moving down and left?\n\nWait, the 2s in the input seem to act as triggers. Looking at Example 0, the 2 is in row 4. Then, the output rows starting at row 4 have a 8 starting at position 2, then 0,0,0,8, etc. So maybe each 2 in a column causes the 8s from above to start propagating down but shifted in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about moving the 8s down and to the right, with each row shift, and the 2s mark where the 8s start their path. Let's check Example 2. The input has 8s in rows 2, 6, 9, and 2s in row 11. The output has blocks of 8s. Like, the first output row ends with four 8s, the next starts with four 8s, etc. It looks like the 8s are being grouped into blocks of four and shifted left or right in subsequent rows. But how does that relate to the 2s? The input's 2s are in row 11, columns 4 and 8. The output in row 11 has 2s in the same positions. So maybe the 2s are fixed points, and the 8s are arranged in a pattern based on their original positions and the 2s.\n\nWait, another approach: in each example, the output seems to propagate the 8s downwards but in a staggered way. For example, in Example 0, the 8s in the first row are repeated for four rows, then in the next set of rows (starting with the row containing the 2), the 8s shift to the right by one each time. Wait, looking at the output rows in Example 0:\n\nFirst four rows: same as input's first row.\n\nRow 4: [2,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nThen rows 5-10 have the same 8 positions as row 4, but with the 2 gone (since those rows didn't have a 2 in the input). Then rows 10-16 have the 8s shifted again. Wait, row 10 in input has a 2, and in output, row 10 starts with 2, then the 8s are shifted further. So maybe each time there's a 2 in a column, the 8s start shifting from that position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s in the input are acting as points where the 8s start a new pattern. For each 2 in the input, the 8s from the rows above are propagated down, but shifted in a certain direction.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 in row 3, column 10. The output for that row becomes [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,2]. Then in the rows below, the 8s shift left. For instance, the next row (row4) is [0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]. Then row7 has another 2 in column10. The output row7 is [8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,2], which shifts the 8s to the left compared to previous rows. So each time there's a 2, the 8s start a new pattern of shifting left?\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 8s in rows 2,6,9, and 2s in row 11. The output has blocks of 8s that cycle. The first three output rows have 8s moving from the end to the start. Then rows 4-6 repeat a similar pattern, and so on. The 2s in the output are in the same positions as the input. So perhaps the 8s are arranged in blocks that shift based on the 2s' positions.\n\nPutting this together, maybe the pattern is that each 8 in the input is part of a diagonal or a pattern that shifts as you go down the rows, and the 2s in the input determine where these shifts start. Alternatively, when there's a 2 in a column, the 8s above that column are propagated down in a staggered way.\n\nLooking at the test input, the 2s are in row 11, columns 3, 7, 12. Wait, let me check the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: ends with 8.\n\nRows 5 and 8 and 10 also end with 8.\n\nRow 11 has 2s at positions 2,6,11 (assuming zero-based indexing). Wait, the test input's row 11 is:\n\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo columns 2,6,11 have 2s. Now, how would the 8s in rows 2,5,8,10 (all in column 16, but the test input has length 17 per row. Wait, in row 2, the last element is 8. Similarly, rows 5,8,10 have 8 in column 16 (assuming 0-based, index 16 is the last element). \n\nSo the test input has 8s in column 16 of rows 2,5,8,10. And 2s in row 11, columns 2,6,11.\n\nNow, applying the pattern from the examples. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the first row has 8s in columns 1,5,7,9. The output propagates these down in a way where each subsequent set of rows shifts the 8s to the right. The 2 in row4 column0 causes the 8s to start appearing in column2 and onwards. Then the 2 in row10 causes another shift.\n\nIn the test input, the 8s are all in column 16. But according to the examples, perhaps each 8 in a column starts a pattern that propagates down and shifts left or right. However, the 2s are in row11, columns 2,6,11. So maybe each 2 in a column triggers the 8s from above to start appearing in a shifted manner.\n\nWait, in the test input, the 8s are in column 16 of certain rows. The 2s are in columns 2,6,11 of row11. So perhaps the 8s from rows 2,5,8,10 (column16) will be propagated down starting from the row of the 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 8 in the input is part of a diagonal that shifts to the left as you go down. For example, in Example 2, the 8s in rows 2,6,9 (column0) turn into blocks of 4 8s that cycle through the rows. So the output rows have 8s grouped in blocks that shift each row.\n\nBut the test input's 8s are all in the last column. Maybe those 8s will form a pattern that shifts leftwards as they go down. However, the 2s in row11 might influence how they shift.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of 2s in certain columns might cause the 8s to \"flow\" towards those columns. For example, each 2 in a column could create a path where 8s from above are directed towards that column, shifting as they go down.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at Example 0 and 1, the output seems to have the 8s arranged in a way that they shift to the right or left in the rows following a 2. So in Example 0, after the 2 in row4, the 8s start at column2 and then shift right each row? Wait, row4 in the output of Example0 is [2,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. Then the rows below (5-9) have the same pattern. Then row10 has [2,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8]. So maybe the 2 in row10 causes a further shift. So each 2 in a row causes the 8s to shift further right in subsequent rows.\n\nSo, maybe each time a 2 is encountered in a row, the 8s from that row onward are shifted by an additional step to the right. So the number of 2s in previous columns determines the shift amount.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are markers where the 8s start a new wave of propagation. For example, in Example0, the first 2 in row4 causes the 8s to start from column2, then the next 2 in row10 causes them to start from column3, etc.\n\nIn the test input, the 2s are in row11, columns2,6,11. So maybe each of these 2s will cause the 8s above them to start propagating in a shifted manner. But the 8s are in column16 of earlier rows. So perhaps the 8s from rows 2,5,8,10 (column16) will flow towards the 2s' columns as they go down.\n\nWait, maybe each 8 in the input is part of a diagonal that moves towards the 2s. For example, in the test input, the 8s are in column16. If there's a 2 in column2, then the 8s would move leftwards each row until they reach column2. But since the 8s are in row2, column16, they would need to move left 14 steps to reach column2 in row16 (if each step is one row down and one left). But the test input has 12 rows (rows 0-11). Let me check the test input's row count. The test input has rows 0-11 (12 rows), and each row has 17 elements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 8 in a column starts a vertical shift where each subsequent row has the 8 shifted left by a certain number of positions. For example, if there's an 8 in row2, column16, then in row3, it's at column15, row4 column14, etc., until it hits a 2's column. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example2's output, the 8s are grouped into blocks of four and shifted left each row. For instance, the first three output rows have 8s in columns 8-11, then 4-7, then 0-3, then again. So maybe it's a rotation of blocks. But how does that relate to the input? The input in Example2 has 8s in rows 2,6,9 (column0), and 2s in row11. The output transforms those into these shifting blocks. So perhaps the presence of 8s in certain rows triggers these blocks, and the 2s are fixed.\n\nIn the test input, the 8s are in column16 of rows 2,5,8,10. If the pattern is to create blocks of 8s that shift left each row, then starting from those rows, each subsequent row would have the block shifted left by some amount. For example, row2 has 8 in column16. The output might have a block starting there and shifting left each row. But how would the 2s affect this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 2 in a column starts a new block of 8s. For example, in the test input's row11, columns2,6,11 have 2s. So each of these columns could start a block of 8s that fill four positions to the left. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the 2s as separators or markers where the 8s should wrap around. For example, in Example2, the 2s are in columns4 and8, and the blocks of 8s are arranged around those.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to find a common pattern across the examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\n- The 2s in the input remain in the same position in the output.\n- The 8s from the input are propagated downwards in some pattern, possibly shifted.\n- The propagation seems to start at the rows where the 2s are present. For instance, in Example0, the first 2 is in row4, and starting from there, the 8s are shifted.\n- The shift direction might be to the right, as in Example0, where after the 2, the 8s start appearing further right each time.\n\nWait, in Example0's output:\n\n- Rows 0-3: same as input row0.\n- Row4 (input had a 2 in column0): 8s start at column2, then 6, 8, 10.\n- Then rows5-9 repeat the same 8 positions as row4.\n- Then row10 (input has a 2 in column0 again? Wait, input row10 is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Output row10: [2,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8]. So the 8s are now shifted further right. So each time a 2 is encountered, the shift for the 8s increases by one.\n\nSo perhaps each 2 in a row triggers a rightward shift for the 8s in subsequent rows. So in Example0, the first 2 (row4) causes a shift of +1, then the second 2 (row10) causes a shift of +2, and so on. But in Example0's output, row4's 8s start at column2, which is two positions right of the original row0's first 8 at column1. Then row10's 8s start at column3, which is one more shift. So maybe each 2 increases the shift by one.\n\nIn Example1, the input has 2s in rows3,7,11 (column9 or 10). The output starts with rows0-2 being the same as input row0. Then row3 has a 2 and starts shifting the 8s left. So maybe each 2 causes a shift in the opposite direction. Or perhaps the direction depends on the example.\n\nAlternatively, the shift direction is determined by the position of the 2. For example, in Example0, the first 2 is in column0, and the 8s shift to the right. In Example1, the 2s are in higher columns, so shifts are to the left. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 2s in the rows above determines the shift amount. Each 2 adds a shift of one to the right. So in Example0, row4 has one 2, causing a shift of 1. Row10 has another 2, adding another shift. So the total shift after row10 is 2.\n\nBut how to apply this to the test input.\n\nThe test input has 3 2s in row11, columns2,6,11. Each of these 2s could cause a shift in the 8s. The 8s are in column16 of rows2,5,8,10. So perhaps each 8 in column16 will shift left as they propagate down, and each 2 in row11 will cause the 8s to shift towards those columns.\n\nFor example, the 8 in row2 column16 will shift left by (11 - 2) = 9 steps by the time they reach row11. 16 -9 =7. So column7. But the 2s in row11 are at columns2,6,11. So perhaps the 8s will align with the 2s' columns.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s shift left by one each row until they reach a 2's column. So if an 8 is in row2 column16, and there's a 2 in row11 column2, the 8 would need to shift left 14 positions (from 16 to 2) over 9 rows (rows2 to row11). That's 14 shifts over 9 rows, which is not possible as 14>9. So maybe this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, each 8 creates a diagonal of 8s moving left and down. So row2 column16's 8 would create a diagonal going down-left, so row3 column15, row4 column14, etc. But looking at the test input's row count, rows2 to row11 is 9 rows. So 16-9=7. So in row11, column7. But the 2s in row11 are at columns2,6,11. So perhaps the 8 in row2 column16 would reach column7 in row11. But there's no 2 there. However, in the output, maybe these diagonals would turn into blocks once they hit a 2's column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 2 acts as a point where the 8s from above are accumulated. For example, the 8s from above the 2's row are gathered into the column of the 2. But in Example0, the 2 in row4 column0 causes 8s to appear in column2, which is not the same column. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: the examples have outputs where the 8s form a pattern that depends on the positions of the 2s. For instance, in Example0, the 8s in the output form a staggered pattern starting from the row with the first 2. The first 2 is in row4, and the 8s start at column2. Then the next 2 in row10 has 8s starting at column3. So maybe each 2 causes the 8s to shift right by one in the subsequent rows.\n\nIn the test input, there are three 2s in row11. So perhaps each 2 in a row causes a shift. The 8s in the input (rows2,5,8,10, column16) would then shift right by the number of 2s encountered before reaching that row. For example, the 8 in row2 (column16) is in a row before any 2s (since the 2s are in row11), so maybe it shifts right once for each 2. But since there are three 2s in row11, perhaps the shift is three positions. But how does that translate into the output?\n\nAlternatively, the number of 2s in the input determines how much the 8s are shifted. For example, each 2 in the entire input adds a shift of one to the 8s. So in Example0, there are two 2s (rows4 and10), so total shift is two. The 8s in the output are shifted right by two positions. But in Example0's first row, the 8s are in columns1,5,7,9. Shifting right by two would make them 3,7,9,11, but the output's row4 has 8s in columns2,6,8,10. So perhaps not exactly matching.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is cumulative per 2 encountered. So each time a 2 is found in a column, the shift increments. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLet's try to apply a possible pattern to the test input. The test input's 2s are in row11, columns2,6,11. The 8s are in column16 of rows2,5,8,10. So perhaps each 8 in column16 will propagate down, shifting left each row, and when they reach row11, their positions should align with the columns of the 2s. For example:\n\nRow2, column16: 8. Shifting left 1 per row, so row3:15, row4:14, ..., row11:16 - (11-2) = 16-9=7. So in row11, column7. But the 2s are at columns2,6,11. So 7 isn't there, but maybe multiple 8s from different rows land in columns that are covered by the 2s' columns.\n\nAlternatively, each 8 in the input starts a block of 8s that fill the row in some pattern, perhaps starting from the 8's position and extending left. For example, in Example2, the input 8s are in column0, and the output has blocks of 4 8s starting from there. So maybe in the test input, each 8 in column16 would generate a block of 4 8s moving left. So row2's 8 in column16 would generate 8s in columns13-16 of row2, but the test input's output hasn't been generated yet. \n\nWait, in Example2's input, the 8s are in column0 of certain rows, and the output has blocks of 4 8s starting from column0 and shifting left each row. So in the test input, the 8s are in column16, so maybe they generate blocks of 8s starting from column13 (since 16-3=13) in the first row where the 8 appears, then shifting left each row. For example:\n\nRow2's 8 in column16 becomes [13,14,15,16] in row2's output. Then row3 would have [9,10,11,12], row4 [5,6,7,8], row5 [1,2,3,4], and so on. Then in row11, perhaps these blocks wrap around, but the 2s would affect this. But the 2s are in row11, columns2,6,11. So maybe the blocks align with these columns.\n\nAlternatively, each 8 in the input creates a vertical line of 8s downward, but shifted left by some amount each time. For example, in Example0, the 8s in the first row are copied down for four rows, then shifted right. But it's not clear.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in the outputs of the examples, the number of 8s increases significantly. This suggests that the transformation involves propagating the existing 8s into multiple positions, possibly in a wave-like pattern.\n\nIn Example0, the first row has four 8s, and the output has many more 8s in subsequent rows. It seems like each 8 in the input leads to a diagonal of 8s propagating downward and to the right. For example, the 8 at position1 in the first row leads to 8s at position2 in row4, position3 in row10, etc. This would explain the increasing number of 8s.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be that each row in the output is a copy of the row above, but shifted right by one, with 8s added whenever a 2 is encountered. But the 2s are in the same column as the shifts.\n\nAnother possible approach: the output rows are generated by taking the input rows and, for each row, if there's a 2, then the 8s from the previous rows are shifted and added to the current row. For instance, in Example0's row4, the 2 causes the 8s from row0 to be shifted right by 2 and added to row4. Then subsequent rows until the next 2 copy that shifted pattern. Then when the next 2 comes (row10), another shift is applied.\n\nThis would mean that each time a 2 is encountered, the existing pattern of 8s is shifted by a certain amount and added to the current row. The number of shifts could be cumulative. For example, each 2 adds a shift of +1 to the right. \n\nSo in Example0:\n\n- The first 2 in row4 causes the initial 8s (positions1,5,7,9) to shift right by 1, leading to positions2,6,8,10. So row4's 8s start at position2.\n- The next 2 in row10 causes another shift of +1, leading to positions3,7,9,11. But in the output, row10's 8s are at positions3,7,9,11. Then subsequent rows have that pattern.\n\nIn the test input, there are three 2s in row11. So applying this logic, each 2 would add a shift. So if the original 8s are in column16, then after three shifts (each +1 to the right), they would be at 16 +3=19. But the rows are only 17 columns long. Hmm, that can't be. So perhaps shifts are to the left.\n\nWait, maybe shifts are to the left. In Example0, the first shift after row4 could be to the right, but maybe in other examples it's different. Alternatively, shifts alternate direction. \n\nAlternatively, the direction of the shift depends on the column of the 2. For example, if the 2 is in a column to the left of the 8s, the shift is to the right; if to the right, shift left. But this is speculation.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is always to the right, but the number of shifts is the number of 2s encountered before the current row. For instance, in Example0's row4, it's the first 2, so shift +1. In row10, the second 2, shift +2. So the total shift after two 2s is +2.\n\nBut in Example0's row10's output, the first 8 is at position3, which is two shifts from the original position1 (1+2=3). So this fits.\n\nApplying this to the test input: the 8s are in column16 of rows2,5,8,10. The 2s are in row11, columns2,6,11. There are three 2s. So for each 8 in the input, the shift would be +3. So original position16, shift+3 would be 19, which is beyond the row length (17). So perhaps this is not correct. Alternatively, the shifts are to the left. If each 2 causes a left shift of 1, then three 2s would shift 3 positions left. So 16-3=13. So the 8s would be in column13 of the output rows after the shifts.\n\nBut how does this apply to the output rows? Let's see. The test input has 8s in rows2,5,8,10, column16. The output would need to shift these 8s left by 3 positions (because of three 2s), resulting in column13. Then, each of these rows would have 8s starting at column13 and maybe propagating in some pattern.\n\nBut how do the 2s in row11 affect this? The 2s are in row11, so perhaps any 8s reaching that row would be positioned according to the shifts. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the 2s are in row11, the shifts are applied to the 8s as they propagate down to row11. For each 8 in row2 (column16), the shift would be 11-2=9 rows down. So 9 shifts. If each shift is to the left by 1, then the 8 would be at column16-9=7. Which is column7. The 2s in row11 are at columns2,6,11. So 7 is not exactly matching, but perhaps the 8s are spread into blocks that align with the 2s' columns.\n\nAlternatively, each 8 in the input creates a horizontal line of 8s starting from their column and extending left, but how many positions? In Example2, each 8 in column0 results in four 8s to the right. So maybe each 8 in column16 would create four 8s to the left. So row2's 8 in column16 would create 8s in columns13-16. Then, each subsequent row would shift this block left by four positions. So row3: 9-12, row4:5-8, row5:1-4, etc. Then, when a row contains a 2, those positions are filled with 8s. \n\nIn the test input's output, row11 has 2s in columns2,6,11. So the blocks of 8s might be positioned to include these columns. For example, a block from columns0-3 would include 2, a block from 4-7 includes6, and a block from 8-11 includes11. So maybe each 2's column is covered by a block of 8s. But how does this happen?\n\nIn Example2's output, the blocks of 8s are four in a row and shift left each row. So applying that to the test input:\n\n- The 8s in column16 would create a block of four 8s in columns13-16 of their respective rows.\n- Each subsequent row shifts this block left by four columns.\n- So row2:13-16\n- row3:9-12\n- row4:5-8\n- row5:1-4\n- row6: would wrap around? Or stop.\n- But since row5 has an 8 in column16, maybe the pattern continues.\n\nHowever, the test input has 8s in rows2,5,8,10. Each of these would start their own block:\n\n- Row2: columns13-16\n- Row5: columns13-16\n- Row8: columns13-16\n- Row10: columns13-16\n\nEach of these would shift left by four each row. So:\n\nRow2's block: 13-16 in row2, then 9-12 in row3, 5-8 in row4, 1-4 in row5.\n\nRow5's block: 13-16 in row5, 9-12 in row6, 5-8 in row7, 1-4 in row8.\n\nRow8's block:13-16 in row8, 9-12 in row9,5-8 in row10,1-4 in row11.\n\nRow10's block:13-16 in row10,9-12 in row11.\n\nThen, in row11, there are blocks from row8 and row10:\n\n- From row8:1-4 in row11\n- From row10:9-12 in row11.\n\nBut the 2s in row11 are at columns2,6,11. So column2 is in 1-4 (row8's block), column6 is in 5-8 (but not covered), and column11 is in 9-12 (row10's block).\n\nBut this doesn't explain how the 8s would be in the columns of the 2s. Perhaps the 2s are in the same columns where the blocks of 8s are, but this needs to be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s in the test input's rows2,5,8,10 each generate a block of four 8s in their row, and these blocks shift left by four each row. So in row2:13-16, row3:9-12, row4:5-8, row5:1-4. Then, row5's own block would start at13-16, which would shift to 9-12 in row6, etc. This would create overlapping blocks.\n\nBut considering the test input's 2s are in row11, columns2,6,11. The block from row2 would reach row5 with columns1-4, which includes column2. The block from row5 would reach row9 with columns9-12, which includes column11. The block from row8 would reach row11 with columns1-4 (from row8's block: row8 columns13-16, row9 9-12, row10 5-8, row11 1-4), which includes column2. The block from row10 would reach row11's columns9-12 (since row10's block is 13-16, row11's shift would be 9-12), which includes column11.\n\nSo in row11, the 8s would be in columns1-4 (from row2 and row8's blocks) and 9-12 (from row5 and row10's blocks). The 2s are in columns2 (within 1-4), 6 (not covered), and11 (within9-12). So the output row11 would have 8s in columns1-4 and9-12. But the 2s are in columns2,6,11. So column6 doesn't have 8s, which might mean the output would have 8s in columns2 and11, but not6. However, the example outputs seem to include the 2s in their positions, regardless of the 8s.\n\nBut the test input's row11 has 2s in columns2,6,11, and according to the pattern, row11's output would have 8s in 1-4 and9-12. But the 2s are in columns2 and11. So perhaps the output row11 would have the 8s in those columns plus the 2s. So combining the 8s and 2s:\n\nOutput row11 would be [8,8,2,8, ... , 8,8,2, ...]. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, the 2s remain in their positions, and the 8s are filled around them. So in row11, columns2 and11 have 2s, and the rest are filled with 8s in their respective blocks. But the 2s are not overwritten by 8s. For example, in Example0, the 2 in row4 remains, and the 8s are added around it.\n\nPutting this together, the test output's row11 would look like:\n\n[... 8,8,2,8,8, 2, ... 8,8,2, ...] but need to fit the blocks.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Given the time I have, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example2's output, the 2s are in the same positions as the input, and the 8s form blocks that shift every few rows. The test input's 2s are in row11, columns2,6,11. The 8s in the test input are in column16 of earlier rows. Following Example2's pattern, these 8s might form blocks that shift left by four each row. \n\nFor instance, row2's 8 in column16 would create a block of 8s in columns13-16. Then row3:9-12, row4:5-8, row5:1-4. \n\nRow5's 8 in column16 would create a block in13-16, which would shift to 9-12 in row6, etc. \n\nRow8's 8 in column16 would create a block in13-16, shifting to 9-12 in row9, etc.\n\nRow10's 8 in column16 would create a block in13-16, shifting to9-12 in row11.\n\nSo in row11, the blocks from row8 and row10 would be:\n\n- Row8's block would have shifted to1-4 in row11 (from row8:13-16 \u2192 row9:9-12 \u2192 row10:5-8 \u2192 row11:1-4).\n- Row10's block is in9-12 in row11.\n\nAdditionally, the 2s in row11 are in columns2 (which is in1-4), 6 (which is between5-8, but there's no block there in row11), and11 (which is in9-12).\n\nSo the output row11 would have 8s in columns1-4 and9-12, with 2s in columns2,6,11. But how to combine these.\n\nThe 2s are in columns2,6,11. The 8s are in1-4 and9-12. So in row11's output:\n\nColumns1:8, 2:2,3:8,4:8,5:0,6:2,7:0,8:0,9:8,10:8,11:2,12:8, etc. But this is speculative.\n\nBut looking at the examples, the 2s are preserved in their original positions, and the 8s are filled around them. So the 8s would fill the block positions, and the 2s would be present in their columns.\n\nSo the test output's row11 would be:\n\n[8,8,2,8,8,0,2,0,0,8,8,2,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut since each row in the test input has 17 elements, the exact arrangement depends on how the blocks shift.\n\nThis is quite complex, but based on Example2's pattern, the test output would have blocks of 8s shifting left each row, with the 2s remaining in their original positions. So the final answer would have rows with 8s arranged in blocks that shift left every row, starting from the positions of the input 8s, and the 2s in row11 columns2,6,11.",
