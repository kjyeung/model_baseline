        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Looking at the training examples, the output seems to involve adding 4s in certain positions. Let's go through each example step by step.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has a structure made of 6s that looks like a sort of diamond or maybe a hexagon. The output replaces some 0s with 4s in a pattern that seems to form an outline or maybe fills the area around the 6s. The 4s are placed in a diagonal or cross-like pattern. For instance, in the middle row, there's a 4 in the center. Then the rows above and below have 4s spreading out. Maybe the 4s are forming a diamond shape around the 6 structure?\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 7-shaped structure that's like a rectangle with a missing part. The output has 4s arranged in a diagonal line starting from the top-left corner. The first two rows have 4s moving diagonally. Then in the middle rows, there's a full row of 4s. The 7s are surrounded by 4s in a cross or maybe a plus sign pattern. So maybe the 4s are forming a diagonal cross or something?\n\nExample 2's input has a 3-based structure. The output replaces some 0s with 4s. For the rows with 3s, the 0s inside the 3 structure are replaced with 4s. Then the lower rows have 4s in a checkerboard-like pattern? Wait, the last two rows in the output have 4s except for the ends. The fifth row starts and ends with 0, with 4s in between. The sixth row starts with 4, then 0, then 4s again, ends with 4. Hmm, maybe it's a mirror or some alternating pattern.\n\nLooking for a common pattern across all examples: It seems like the 4s are being placed in positions that are adjacent to the non-zero numbers (6,7,3) but perhaps in a specific way. Wait, maybe the 4s form a diamond shape around the original non-zero regions, or maybe they are filling the areas that are inside a certain boundary. Alternatively, maybe the 4s are creating a border around the non-zero elements, but in a particular direction.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the original 6s form a sort of 'H' shape. The output adds 4s in the middle of that H and around it. Similarly, in Example 1, the 7s form a sort of 'U' shape. The 4s in the output create a diagonal cross through the center of the grid. Hmm, maybe the 4s are forming a plus sign or cross that's centered in the grid, but overlapped with the existing numbers.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs: in Example 0's output, the 4s form a diamond pattern in the upper part of the grid. The rows start with a single 4 in the middle, then spread out. Then, in the lower part where the 6s are, the 4s are inserted into the 0s that are adjacent to the 6s. Wait, maybe the 4s are filling the convex hull or some enclosed area around the original numbers. Or perhaps the 4s are forming a diamond grid that's overlaid on the original structure.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 4s are placed in all cells that are part of the Manhattan distance (diagonal steps) from the center of the figure. Alternatively, the 4s are placed in cells where the cell is part of a diamond-shaped region, but only where there were 0s in the input. For example, in Example 0, the center of the grid (assuming 7x7) is row 3, column 3. The 4s form a diamond expanding from there. But the 6s are in the lower part. Wait, perhaps the 4s are filling the cells that are part of a diamond shape, but only in the upper part where the 0s were. Then, where the original non-zero numbers are, the 4s are placed in the 0s adjacent to them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s are filling the regions that are enclosed by the original numbers. For example, in Example 2, the 3s form a square with a hollow center. The output fills the hollow with 4s. Then the lower part has some 4s arranged in a pattern. Wait, the output for Example 2's last two rows: the fifth row has 0s at the ends and 4s in the middle. The sixth row alternates 4 and 0. Maybe this is a checkerboard pattern where even and odd rows have different placements.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, perhaps the rule is that any 0 cell that is part of a certain path (like a spiral or cross) is replaced with 4. For instance, in Example 1, the 4s start from the top-left and form a diagonal, then fill the middle rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the 4s are forming a cross (plus sign) that's centered in the grid, but only in areas where the input was 0. Let's check Example 0. The grid is 7x7. The middle row (index 3) in the output has 4 in the middle (position 3). The rows above and below have 4s moving outward. For example, row 2 has 4s at positions 1,3,5. Wait, no, in the output of Example 0:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,4,0,0,0] \u2192 center is 3 (0-based index)\nRow 1: [4,0,0,4,0,0,4] \u2192 positions 0,3,6\nRow 2: [0,4,0,4,0,4,0] \u2192 positions 1,3,5\nRow 3: [0,0,4,4,4,0,0] \u2192 positions 2,3,4\nRow 4: [0,6,6,4,6,6,0] \u2192 position 3 is 4\nSo the 4s here form a diamond pattern, centered in the grid. Then, in the lower rows where there are 6s, the 4s are inserted in the 0 positions adjacent to the 6s. But wait, the 6s in row 4 (original input) have a 4 in the middle. So perhaps the 4s are first forming a diamond in the center of the entire grid, and then also filling in areas adjacent to the original numbers.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's first few rows have 4s forming a diagonal. The first row starts with a 4, then the next row has a 4 one position to the right, etc. Then, in the middle rows, the entire row is filled with 4s. But the original 7s are in the right half. So maybe the 4s are forming a cross or diamond in the left part, and the 7s are on the right. The 4s in the middle rows fill the entire left side but stop at the 7s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are filling the regions that are enclosed by the original numbers. For example, in Example 0, the 6s form a shape, and the 4s fill the upper part which is enclosed by zeros. Wait, maybe it's the opposite: the 4s are the outline of the original shape. But in Example 0's output, the 6s are still present, and the 4s are in the areas around them.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 4s as a kind of outline or a frame. For Example 2, the 3s form a square, and the 4s are filling the inner part (replacing the 0s inside the 3s). The lower part of the grid has a different pattern where 4s are placed in a checkerboard-like way.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the first three rows are a 3 square with a hollow center. The output replaces the hollow (the 0s inside) with 4s. The next row (row 3) has 3s and 0s, and in the output, those 0s are replaced with 4s. Then the last two rows in the input are all 0s, but in the output, they have 4s arranged in a pattern where even and odd rows have different positions. For example, row 4 (input all 0s) becomes [0,4,4,4,4,0], and row 5 becomes [4,0,4,4,0,4]. So maybe in even rows (0-based), the 4s are placed in the middle positions, and in odd rows, they alternate between 4 and 0. Or maybe it's a diamond pattern again but starting from the bottom.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s form a diamond pattern that's centered in the entire grid. For example, in Example 0 (7x7 grid), the center is at (3,3). The diamond expands from there, but only where there are 0s. So in rows above and below, the 4s are placed at increasing distances from the center. Then, when there's a non-zero number (like 6), those positions remain as 6, but the 4s are placed in the 0s around them.\n\nSo, the general pattern might be: for each cell, if it's part of a diamond-shaped region centered in the grid and the cell was 0 in the input, replace it with 4. Additionally, in regions where there are non-zero numbers, the 4s are placed in the surrounding 0s according to some other rule, perhaps expanding the diamond into those areas.\n\nBut how does this apply to the test input?\n\nLooking at the test input, which is a 10x10 grid. The structure is made of 2s. Let's see the input:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 3: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 4: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 5: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 6: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 7: [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 8: [0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis looks like a vertical line of 2s in the middle (columns 1), except for rows 0 and 8, which have 2s in columns 1-4. So it's like a vertical line (column 1) from row 0 to row 8, but with some horizontal parts at the top and bottom. The shape resembles a stylized 'I' perhaps.\n\nApplying the pattern: The output should replace certain 0s with 4s. Following the previous examples, the 4s would form a diamond in the center of the grid and also fill in the areas around the 2s.\n\nThe center of a 10-row grid would be between rows 4 and 5. So perhaps the diamond starts there. Let's calculate the Manhattan distance from the center. For a diamond pattern, each cell (i,j) is part of the diamond if |i - c_row| + |j - c_col| \u2264 radius. The center for a 10x10 grid would be at (4.5, 4.5), but since it's discrete, maybe the diamond is centered around (5,5) or similar. Alternatively, considering the original examples: in example 0, a 7x7 grid (center at 3,3), the diamond expands to cover the upper half. For example 1, a 9x9 grid, the diamond starts at the top-left and expands down to the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the diamond pattern is adjusted based on the position of the existing numbers. For the test input, the main structure is in columns 1 and 4 (rows 0,8) and column 1 in the middle rows. The 4s would form a diamond around the center of the grid, replacing 0s. Also, any 0s adjacent to the 2s might be replaced with 4s, but looking at example 0, the 4s are inserted into the 0s that are part of the diamond and also fill the areas around the 6s.\n\nWait, in example 0's input, the 6s are in rows 4,5,6. The output has 4s in the upper part (diamond) and in the lower part, within the 6 structure. For example, in row 4, the original 6s are at positions 1,2,4,5. The output has a 4 in position 3 (the middle of the row). Similarly, row 5 has 4s in the middle positions. So perhaps the 4s are filling the 'holes' inside the 6s' structure, but also forming the diamond in the upper part.\n\nSo, putting this together: the transformation involves two steps. First, overlay a diamond pattern of 4s centered in the grid. Second, within the non-zero (non-0) regions of the input, replace the 0s that are enclosed or adjacent to the non-zero numbers with 4s. Additionally, in areas outside the diamond but adjacent to the non-zero numbers, 4s are placed.\n\nAlternatively, the diamond pattern is determined by the entire grid's center, and any 0s in that diamond are replaced with 4s. Then, the 0s that are inside the non-zero shapes (like the 3s in example 2) are replaced with 4s. Additionally, the 0s adjacent to the non-zero numbers along certain directions are replaced with 4s.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about Manhattan distance. For the diamond pattern, each cell (i,j) in the grid that satisfies |i - c| + |j - c| \u2264 r would be filled with 4 if the original cell was 0. Then, for the non-zero regions, any 0s that are adjacent (in some way) are also replaced with 4s.\n\nIn example 0, the diamond is centered at (3,3) with radius 3. The cells within Manhattan distance 3 are filled with 4s where there were 0s. Then, the 6s are in the lower part. The 4s inside the 6's structure (like the middle of row 4) are part of the diamond. But the 6s themselves remain.\n\nIn example 1, the diamond is possibly centered at (4,4) (since it's a 9x9 grid), and the 4s form a diamond that covers parts of the grid. The 7s are in the right half, and the 4s fill the left half and parts of the right where there were 0s.\n\nFor the test input, which is 10 rows (0-9) and 10 columns (0-9), the center would be around (4.5, 4.5). So the diamond pattern would cover cells where |i - 4.5| + |j - 4.5| \u2264 r. But since the grid is even in both dimensions, maybe the center is considered as (5,5) for the diamond. Let's try that.\n\nThe Manhattan distance from (5,5) would be |i-5| + |j-5|. For a radius of, say, 4, the diamond would cover cells where |i-5| + |j-5| \u22644. So in the test input, the 4s would be placed in those cells where they were 0 in the input. Then, the 2s in the input are in columns 1,4, etc. Any 0s adjacent to 2s would also be replaced with 4s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the diamond is formed in the upper part of the grid. Looking at the test input, the main 2 structure is vertical. The diamond might be centered in the middle of the grid, and the 4s would fill that area. Let's try to draw it.\n\nThe test input's 2s form a vertical line in column 1 from row 0 to 8, except rows 0 and 8 have horizontal 2s. So it's like a vertical line with horizontal lines at top and bottom. The diamond 4 pattern would be in the center. For a 10x10 grid, the center is at (4.5, 4.5). So the diamond would include cells where their Manhattan distance from (4.5,4.5) is up to a certain radius. For example, radius 4.5 would cover a large diamond. Let's compute for a few cells:\n\nFor cell (5,5): |5-4.5| + |5-4.5| = 0.5 +0.5 =1 \u22644.5 \u2192 yes.\n\nBut how to handle this in integers. Maybe the diamond is from rows 0 to 9, columns 0 to 9, and the radius is 4. So Manhattan distance \u22644. The center is at (4.5,4.5), so the diamond would include cells where i + j is between certain values. Hmm, maybe the diamond's boundaries are determined by the maximum Manhattan distance from the center.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the diamond is created such that the rows from 0 to 9 have 4s placed in positions that form a diamond. For example, row 4 (0-based) would have 4s from column 0 to 9, but maybe that's not the case.\n\nLooking at the test input's expected output, maybe the 4s form a diamond in the center of the grid, replacing 0s. Additionally, the 0s inside the 2's structure (like the hollow parts) are replaced with 4s.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows 0 and 8, the 2s form horizontal lines. The rows in between (rows 1-7) have 2s in column 1 and sometimes column 4. The 0s inside the 2s (like in rows 1 and 7, columns 2-3) would be replaced with 4s. For example, row 1 in the input is [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. The output might have 4s in the positions that were 0 between the 2s, so columns 2 and 3.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 is [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0], so columns 2 and 3 would become 4s. The vertical 2s (column 1) have 0s to their right (columns 2 and beyond), but those might be replaced with 4s if they are in the diamond.\n\nBut this is getting a bit unclear. Let's try to think of another pattern.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the output 4s are placed in a way that they form a diamond in the upper part and fill the areas around the non-zero numbers. For example, in Example 0, the upper part (rows 0-3) have 4s forming a diamond, and the lower part (rows 4-6) have 4s inserted into the 0s of the 6s' structure.\n\nAnother possible pattern is that the 4s are placed in the cells where the sum of the row index and column index is even or odd. But looking at the outputs, this doesn't seem to hold.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s are placed in cells that are part of a cross (horizontal and vertical center lines). For example, in Example 0's output, the middle row (3) has 4s in columns 2,3,4. The middle column (3) has 4s in rows 0-6. But this doesn't fully explain the diamond pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the 4s form a diamond in the grid, but the diamond's size depends on the grid's size. For example, in a 7x7 grid (Example 0), the diamond would have a radius of 3. For a 9x9 grid (Example 1), radius 4. For the test input's 10x10 grid, the diamond would have a radius of 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, the diamond is formed by starting from the center and expanding outward in all four diagonal directions. For even-sized grids, the center is between cells, so the diamond might be split.\n\nAnother possibility: The 4s are filling all cells that are part of the largest possible diamond that can fit in the grid, centered at the grid's center, and the diamond is filled with 4s where the input was 0. Then, the areas around the non-zero numbers are also filled with 4s where possible.\n\nFor the test input, the largest diamond centered at the grid's center (between rows 4 and 5, columns 4 and 5) would have a Manhattan distance that covers a certain area. Let's calculate for a radius of 4:\n\nThe cells where |i - 4.5| + |j - 4.5| \u22644.5 would cover most of the grid. But since we're dealing with integers, perhaps the radius is 4, leading to |i -4.5| + |j-4.5| \u22644. So for each cell (i,j), calculate the Manhattan distance from the center. For example, cell (0,0) is 4.5 +4.5 =9, which is larger than 4. So not part of the diamond.\n\nCell (5,5) would be 0.5 +0.5 =1 \u22644 \u2192 yes. So the diamond would include cells where i and j are within 4.5 \u00b14. But this is a bit abstract. Maybe a better approach is to calculate for each cell (i,j) in the test input whether it's part of the diamond. Let's see:\n\nFor the diamond centered at (4.5,4.5) with a radius of 4, the Manhattan distance for a cell (i,j) is (i -4.5) + (j -4.5) \u22644? Wait, Manhattan distance is the sum of absolute differences. So the condition is |i -4.5| + |j -4.5| \u22644.\n\nFor example:\n\nCell (4,4): |4-4.5| + |4-4.5| = 1 \u2192 \u22644 \u2192 yes.\n\nCell (5,5): same as above.\n\nCell (0,4): |0-4.5| + |4-4.5| =4.5 +0.5=5 \u2192 >4 \u2192 no.\n\nCell (3,5): |3-4.5| + |5-4.5| =1.5 +0.5=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the diamond would cover a region around the center. Then, any cell that's part of this diamond and was 0 in the input would be replaced with 4.\n\nThen, additionally, the cells that are inside the non-zero shapes (like the 2s in the test input) would have their 0s replaced with 4s.\n\nFor example, in the test input's row 1: [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. The 0s between the 2s (columns 2 and 3) would be inside the 2s' shape and thus replaced with 4s. Similarly, the vertical line of 2s in column 1 from row 0 to 8 has 0s to the right (columns 2-9), but only those 0s that are part of the diamond would be replaced with 4s.\n\nPutting this all together, the test output should have 4s in the diamond area and in the hollow parts of the 2 structure.\n\nBut how does this look in practice?\n\nLet's attempt to outline the steps for the test input:\n\n1. Identify the diamond pattern centered in the grid. For 10x10, center at (4.5,4.5), radius 4. So cells where |i -4.5| + |j-4.5| \u22644.\n\n2. Replace all 0s in those cells with 4s, provided they are 0 in the input.\n\n3. Additionally, replace any 0s that are enclosed by the non-zero (2s) structure.\n\nFor the test input's structure:\n\n- The 2s form a vertical line in column 1, except rows 0 and 8 have horizontal lines.\n\n- The hollow parts (0s) inside the 2s' structure should be replaced with 4s. For example, in row 0: [0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0], the 0s between columns 1-4 are not present. But rows 1-7 have 0s in columns 2-9 (except rows 0 and 8). Wait, in row 1: columns 2 and 3 are 0s between the 2s in columns 1 and 4. So those would be enclosed and replaced with 4s.\n\nSimilarly, rows 2-7 have 0s to the right of the 2 in column 1. But these are not enclosed, so maybe only the 0s that are enclosed are replaced. For example, the hollow in the 'I' shape (rows 0 and 8's horizontal lines) might have enclosed areas. But in the given test input, the structure is more like a vertical line with horizontal lines at top and bottom, but there's no enclosure except between the top and bottom. So perhaps the hollow between rows 0 and 8's horizontal lines would have 0s replaced with 4s.\n\nWait, but in the test input's rows 0 and 8, the horizontal lines are at the top and bottom. The vertical line runs from row 0 to 8. So the area between the horizontal lines (rows 0 and 8) and the vertical line (column 1 and 4) forms a sort of rectangle. The 0s inside this rectangle would be replaced with 4s. For example, row 0 has 2s from column 1 to 4. Row 8 has 2s from column 1 to 4. The vertical lines are at columns 1 and 4 between rows 0 and 8. So any 0s inside this rectangle (columns 1-4, rows 0-8) would be replaced with 4s. But looking at the input, most of these positions are already 2s, except for the vertical line in column 1. Wait, no. The vertical line is column 1 in all rows from 0 to 8, but rows 0 and 8 have 2s in columns 1-4. So the structure is like:\n\n- Row 0: columns 1-4 are 2s.\n\n- Rows 1-7: column 1 is 2, and in row 8, columns 1-4 are 2s.\n\n- Also, rows 1 and 7 have a 2 in column 4.\n\nThis forms a structure where between rows 0 and 8, columns 1 and 4, there's a vertical line in column 1 and a few 2s in column 4 (rows 1,7,8). So the enclosed area would be between columns 1 and 4, rows 0 and 8, but since rows 1-7 don't have 2s in column 4 except rows 1 and 7, the enclosed area is the space between columns 1 and 4, rows 0 and 8. But since the vertical lines in column 1 run from row 0 to 8, and the horizontal lines are at rows 0 and 8, the enclosed area is the region between columns 1 and 4, rows 0 to 8. However, in most rows (except 0,1,7,8), column 4 is 0, so those would not be enclosed. Thus, the only enclosed 0s are in rows 0 and 8, but those are already 2s. \n\nWait, perhaps the hollow is in row 1 and 7, columns 2 and 3. For example, row 1 has 2s at columns 1 and 4, with 0s in between. So those 0s (columns 2 and 3) would be enclosed and replaced with 4s. Similarly, row 7 has 2s at columns 1 and 4, so the 0s in between would be replaced with 4s. Rows 2-6 have 2 in column 1, but nothing in column 4, so those 0s are not enclosed and may not be replaced unless they are part of the diamond.\n\nSo, applying this, the 4s would be in:\n\n- The diamond pattern centered in the grid.\n\n- The enclosed areas of the 2s (rows 1 and 7, columns 2 and 3).\n\nNow, combining these two:\n\nIn the test input's output, the 4s would appear in the diamond region and in the enclosed parts of the 2 structure.\n\nLet's try to imagine what this would look like.\n\nFor the diamond centered at (4.5,4.5) with radius 4, the cells that are 0 in the input would become 4s. Let's see:\n\nFor example, the cell at (5,5) is 0 in the input. So it becomes 4. Other cells in the diamond would also be 4 if they were 0.\n\nThe enclosed areas in rows 1 and 7 (columns 2 and 3) would be 4s.\n\nAdditionally, the vertical line of 2s in column 1 has 0s to the right. For example, in row 2, column 2 is 0. If this is part of the diamond, it becomes 4.\n\nBut how to determine which 0s are in the diamond. Let's take specific rows and columns.\n\nRow 0 in the test input is [0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. The diamond's radius 4 would include cells where |0 -4.5| + |j -4.5| \u22644. For j=0: 4.5 +4.5=9 >4 \u2192 no. j=1: 4.5 +3.5=8>4 \u2192 no. So row 0 is outside the diamond, so the 0s here stay 0 except if they're in the enclosed area. But row 0's 0s are outside the diamond. Only the 0s in columns 5-9 are 0, but those are outside the diamond. So they remain 0.\n\nRow 5 (middle row) in the test input is [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The diamond would include cells where |5 -4.5| + |j -4.5| \u22644 \u2192 0.5 + |j-4.5| \u22644 \u2192 |j-4.5| \u22643.5 \u2192 j can be from 1 to 8 (since 4.5-3.5=1, 4.5+3.5=8). So columns 1-8. The cell (5,5) is part of the diamond. So in row 5, columns 1-8 (except column 1 which is 2) would be 4 if they were 0. So the output row 5 would be [0,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0].\n\nWait, but the input for row 5 is [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So columns 0 is 0, which is outside the diamond. Columns 2-8 are 0 and within the diamond, so replaced with 4. Column 9 is 0, outside diamond. So row 5's output would be [0,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0].\n\nBut in the training examples, the diamond pattern sometimes overlaps with the non-zero numbers. For example, in Example 0, the 6s are in the lower part and the diamond is in the upper part, but the 4s are also inserted in the middle of the 6s. So maybe the diamond is applied globally, and then any remaining 0s inside the non-zero shapes are replaced with 4s.\n\nPutting all this together, the test input's output would have:\n\n- 4s in the diamond pattern where the input was 0.\n\n- 4s in the enclosed areas of the 2s.\n\n- The 2s remain as 2s.\n\nNow, let's try to construct the output row by row.\n\nTest input rows 0-9:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nApplying the diamond pattern:\n\nThe diamond's center is (4.5,4.5). Radius is 4. So for each cell (i,j), if |i-4.5| + |j-4.5| \u22644 and input cell is 0 \u2192 replace with 4.\n\nLet's compute this for each row:\n\nRow 0:\n\ni=0. For each j:\n\n|0-4.5| + |j-4.5| =4.5 + |j-4.5|. This must be \u22644.\n\n4.5 + |j-4.5| \u22644 \u2192 impossible. So no 4s from diamond. Original row remains, but check enclosed areas.\n\nRow 0's 0s are outside the diamond and not enclosed \u2192 no change.\n\nRow 0's output: [0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1:\n\ni=1. |1-4.5| =3.5. So for j, 3.5 + |j-4.5| \u22644 \u2192 |j-4.5| \u22640.5 \u2192 j=4 or 5. So j=4 and 5 are in the diamond. But row 1's input has 2s at j=1 and 4, and 0s at j=2,3,5-9. So for j=5: input is 0, so becomes 4. j=4: input is 2, so remains. So row 1's output would be:\n\n[0,2,4,4,2,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut also, the 0s at j=2 and 3 are enclosed between the 2s in j=1 and 4. So those would become 4s. So row 1's output becomes:\n\n[0,2,4,4,2,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2:\n\ni=2. |2-4.5|=2.5. So |j-4.5| must be \u22641.5 \u2192 j=3,4,5,6.\n\nSo j=3,4,5,6. Input at j=3,4,5,6 are 0. So they become 4. Also, check if any enclosed areas. Row 2 has 2 at j=1, and 0s elsewhere. The 0s in j=3-6 are part of the diamond. So row 2's output:\n\n[0,2,0,4,4,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nBut also, the 0s to the right of the 2 (j=2 and beyond) may be part of the diamond. Wait, let's re-calculate for row 2, i=2:\n\nj must satisfy 2.5 + |j-4.5| \u22644 \u2192 |j-4.5| \u22641.5 \u2192 j=3,4,5,6. So j=3-6.\n\nSo in row 2, columns 3-6 are 0, so become 4. The rest remain as per input. So row 2 becomes:\n\n[0,2,0,4,4,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3:\n\ni=3. |3-4.5|=1.5. |j-4.5| \u22642.5 \u2192 j ranges from 2 to7.\n\nSo j=2-7. Input for row 3 is 0 at j=2-9. So columns 2-7 are 0 \u2192 replaced with 4. So row 3 becomes:\n\n[0,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0]\n\nRow 4:\n\ni=4. |4-4.5|=0.5. |j-4.5| \u22643.5 \u2192 j=1-8.\n\nRow 4's input has 2 at j=1. Columns 1-8 are 0 except j=1. So columns 1-8 (except j=1) are 0 \u2192 replaced with 4. So row 4 becomes:\n\n[0,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0]\n\nRow 5:\n\ni=5. |5-4.5|=0.5. Same as row 4. j ranges 1-8. Row 5's input is 0 at j=0-9 except j=1. So columns 1-8 (j=1 is 2, others 0) become 4. So row 5 becomes:\n\n[0,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0]\n\nRow 6:\n\ni=6. |6-4.5|=1.5. So j must satisfy 1.5 + |j-4.5| \u22644 \u2192 |j-4.5| \u22642.5 \u2192 j=2-7.\n\nRow 6's input is 0 at j=2-9. So columns 2-7 (0s) become 4. So row 6's output:\n\n[0,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0]\n\nRow 7:\n\ni=7. |7-4.5|=2.5. So j must satisfy 2.5 + |j-4.5| \u22644 \u2192 |j-4.5| \u22641.5 \u2192 j=3-6.\n\nRow 7's input has 2s at j=1 and 4. So columns 3-6 (0s) become 4. Also, enclosed 0s at j=2,3 (between 1 and 4) become 4. So row 7's output:\n\n[0,2,4,4,2,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nWait, row 7's input is [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. The enclosed 0s are j=2 and 3. Those are part of the diamond (j=3 and 4.5 \u2192 j=3: |7-4.5| + |3-4.5| = 2.5 +1.5=4 \u2192 which is equal to the radius, so included. So j=3 is part of the diamond, so becomes 4. j=2: |7-4.5|=2.5, j=2: |2-4.5|=2.5. Sum is 5 \u2192 exceeds 4, so not part of the diamond. So j=2's 0 is not part of the diamond. But in the input, j=2 and 3 are between the 2s at j=1 and 4. Are they enclosed? In row 7, j=1 and 4 are 2s, so the 0s between them (j=2,3) are enclosed. So those should become 4s. So row 7's output would be [0,2,4,4,2,4,0,0,0,0]. But according to the diamond calculation, j=3 is part of the diamond and becomes 4, j=2 is not part of the diamond. But the enclosed area requires replacing those 0s between 2s. So even if j=2 is not in the diamond, it's replaced with 4 because it's enclosed. So row 7's output is [0,2,4,4,2,4,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 8:\n\ni=8. |8-4.5|=3.5. So 3.5 + |j-4.5| \u22644 \u2192 |j-4.5| \u22640.5 \u2192 j=4 or 5. Input row 8 is [0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. j=4 and 5: j=4 is 2 (remains), j=5 is 0 \u2192 becomes 4. So row 8's output would be [0,2,2,2,2,4,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 9:\n\ni=9. |9-4.5|=4.5. So 4.5 + |j-4.5| \u22644 \u2192 impossible. So no 4s. Row 9 remains all 0s.\n\nNow, combining all rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,4,4,2,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,2,0,4,4,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,2,4,4,2,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,2,2,2,2,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, this doesn't seem to match the training examples' style. For instance, in Example 2, the lower rows had a different pattern. Let me check if I missed something.\n\nIn Example 2's test output, the last two rows are:\n\n[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n[4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4]\n\nThis looks like a checkerboard pattern. But in my current approach for the test input, the lower rows (row 9) are all 0s. However, in Example 2, even rows that were all 0s in the input were transformed into a checkerboard-like pattern. This suggests that there's another rule for cells outside the diamond.\n\nLooking back at Example 2's input:\n\nInput row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row 4: [0,4,4,4,4,0]\n\nInput row 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row 5: [4,0,4,4,0,4]\n\nSo for rows that are completely 0, the 4s are placed in a pattern where even and odd rows have different placements. Row 4 (even index, 0-based) has 4s from positions 1-4, while row 5 has 4s at positions 0, 2,3,5.\n\nThis suggests that for rows outside the diamond or not part of any structure, there's an additional pattern where alternating rows have 4s in certain positions.\n\nIn the test input, row 9 is all 0s and outside the diamond. According to Example 2's pattern, such rows might have a checkerboard-like pattern. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are placed in a pattern that depends on the row's parity (even or odd). For example, even-indexed rows have 4s starting at position 0, alternating, while odd-indexed rows start at position 1. But this is speculative.\n\nIn Example 2's output:\n\nRow 4 (even index): [0,4,4,4,4,0]\n\nRow 5 (odd): [4,0,4,4,0,4]\n\nThis looks like in even rows, 4s are placed in the middle positions, and in odd rows, 4s are placed at the edges and middle. But this may not hold for larger grids.\n\nFor the test input's row 9 (index 9, odd), if following Example 2's pattern, the 0s would be replaced with 4s in a checkerboard or alternating pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the 4s are placed in the diamond and in the enclosed areas, and any remaining 0s are replaced with a pattern based on row parity.\n\nBut this complicates the pattern. Since the test input's row 9 is all 0s and outside the diamond, perhaps it remains all 0s. But in Example 2's input, the lower rows are part of the grid and are transformed even though they're outside the diamond. So there's another layer to the pattern.\n\nAnother possibility: The 4s are also placed in cells that are in the same row or column as the diamond's center, but outside the diamond. Or perhaps the 4s form a diamond and a cross.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s are placed in a diamond and also in a spiral pattern. This seems too complex.\n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed with the initial pattern I derived for the test input and compare it to the training examples' structure.\n\nThe final answer would have the 4s in the diamond pattern and the enclosed areas, as calculated earlier. Let's format it as per the examples.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a grid of numbers, and the output seems to modify some of the zeros into fours. Let's start by analyzing each example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has a structure made of 6s. The output adds 4s in a sort of diamond or pyramid shape above the 6 structure. The 4s are placed in positions that form a diamond pattern. For instance, the top of the output has a 4 in the middle, then the next rows have 4s spreading out and then coming back in. It looks like the 4s are filling the area around the 6s but not overlapping them. Also, the 6s in the input are left as is, except where the 4s replace the zeros.\n\nExample 1's input has a 7 structure that looks like a sort of arrow or maybe a rectangle with a tail. The output here has 4s forming a diagonal line from the top-left corner down to the middle, and then expanding into a horizontal band in the middle rows. The 7s are preserved, but around them, the 4s are placed in a way that's maybe creating a diamond or a cross shape. The middle three rows have a full row of 4s except for the last element, which is 7. So maybe there's a combination of filling the space around the 7s with 4s in a certain pattern.\n\nExample 2's input is a grid with 3s forming a square outline and some zeros inside. The output replaces the zeros inside the 3s with 4s. Also, the bottom rows have some 4s arranged in a pattern. For example, the last row has 4s and 0s alternating. It looks like the 4s are filling the areas adjacent to the 3s, maybe creating a border or shadow effect. The bottom two rows have 4s where there were zeros, but with some alternations.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern seems to involve adding 4s in regions adjacent to the non-zero numbers (like 6,7,3) in the input. The 4s form a kind of outline or fill around the existing numbers. The exact placement might depend on the shape of the non-zero regions. For example, in Example 0, the 6s form a sort of cup shape, and the 4s form a diamond above it. In Example 1, the 7s form a sort of vertical structure, and the 4s create a diagonal and horizontal fill around them. In Example 2, the 3s outline a square, and the 4s fill the inside and create a pattern below.\n\nLooking at how the 4s are placed, maybe the rule is to fill cells that are adjacent (either orthogonally or diagonally) to the non-zero cells, but only in certain directions. Or perhaps it's a distance-based fill, where cells at a certain distance from the non-zero cells are replaced with 4s. Alternatively, the 4s could be forming a diamond pattern centered on the original structure.\n\nAnother observation is that in Example 0 and 1, the 4s form layers around the original structure, possibly expanding outward in a specific pattern. For instance, in the first example, the 4s start from the middle top and spread out, which might indicate a diamond shape based on distance from a central point.\n\nWait, let's look at the output for Example 0. The original structure of 6s is in the lower part of the grid. The 4s form a diamond shape above it. The top of the diamond is at row 0, column 3. Then each subsequent row has more 4s spreading out until the middle of the diamond, then narrowing again. So perhaps the 4s are forming a diamond shape that is centered above the original 6s structure. But how is the center determined?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are filling all cells that are in the same row or column as the original non-zero cells but in a certain direction. For instance, in Example 0, the 6s are in rows 4,5,6. The 4s are in rows above, up to row 0, forming a diamond. So maybe the pattern is to create a mirror image or a reflection of the original structure in some way.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the 7s form a kind of vertical line on the right side. The 4s in the output form a diagonal line from the top-left to the middle, then spread out into horizontal lines. This seems more complex. The diagonal part could be a reflection across a diagonal axis. The middle rows have full 4s except the last column which is 7. So perhaps the 4s are filling all cells except those occupied by 7s and some boundary conditions.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 4s are filling all cells that are reachable by moving in certain directions (like up, left, right) from the original non-zero cells, but not overlapping them. For instance, in Example 0, moving upwards from the 6s, creating a diamond shape. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, the 4s could represent some kind of distance from the non-zero elements. For example, cells at Manhattan distance 1, 2, etc., but in a certain pattern. Let's check Example 0: The original 6s are in rows 4-6. The 4s start from row 0 (the top) and spread downward. The distance from the top to the 6s is 4 rows. Maybe the 4s are placed in cells where the Manhattan distance from the nearest non-zero cell is a certain value. But I need to calculate that.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 6s are in row 4 (the fifth row from top) and below. The first 4 in row 0 is in column 3. The distance from that 4 to the nearest 6 would be 4 rows down. If Manhattan distance is row difference plus column difference, then 4 (rows) + 3 (columns?), but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the 4s are placed in cells that are k steps away from the original structure, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are filling the cells that form the convex hull or some other geometric shape around the original structure. For example, in Example 0, the 6s form a U-shape. The 4s form a diamond above it, which could be the convex hull or some minimal enclosing shape.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s are creating a border around the original non-zero elements. But in Example 2, the 3s form a square, and the 4s fill the inside of the square and create some pattern below. Wait, in the input of Example 2, the 3s form a square with some zeros inside. The output replaces those zeros with 4s. Then the bottom two rows have 4s in certain positions. For instance, the fifth row (0-based) has 0,4,4,4,4,0. The sixth row (originally all zeros) has 4,0,4,4,0,4. So maybe there's a pattern where the 4s are filling in the interior of the 3s, and then creating a sort of inverted pyramid or steps below.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to find a common rule across all examples.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output replaces some zeros with 4s, but leaves other zeros as is. The non-zero numbers (6,7,3) remain the same. So the transformation is only changing 0s to 4s in certain positions.\n\nThe key is to find out which 0s get turned into 4s. Let's look for a pattern in the positions of the 4s relative to the original non-zero elements.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput has a U-shape made of 6s. The output's 4s form a diamond shape above the U. The diamond starts at the top center (row 0, column 3) and expands down to row 3 (the middle row of the grid), then contracts again. So the diamond is centered over the U-shape. The center of the diamond is at column 3, which is the middle column of the grid (since the grid is 7 columns wide). So maybe the 4s are forming a diamond shape centered at the middle column, and extending upwards and downwards based on the position of the original structure.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the 4s start from the top-left corner and form a diagonal line. For example, the first row has a 4 in column 0. The second row has a 4 in column 1, third row column 2, fourth row column 3. Then in the middle rows (4-6), there's a horizontal band of 4s. So this seems like a diagonal line from (0,0) to (3,3), then expanding into a horizontal line. The original 7s are on the right side. Maybe the 4s are filling the area to the left of the 7s, but in a diagonal pattern.\n\nWait, the original 7s in Example 1 form a vertical structure on the right side. The 4s in the output form a diagonal from the top-left to the middle-left, then spread out horizontally. So perhaps the 4s are forming a sort of mirror image across a diagonal axis. For instance, reflecting the 7s' vertical structure into a diagonal and horizontal structure on the left.\n\nBut this is getting a bit vague. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the 4s are placed in cells that are in the same row or column as the original non-zero elements but not overlapping them. For example, in Example 0, the 6s are in rows 4,5,6. The 4s are placed in rows 0-3. So maybe the 4s are in all cells above the original structure. But how are they arranged?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a flood fill starting from the top, filling with 4s until reaching the original non-zero elements. But in Example 0, the 4s are not just filling all the space above the 6s. They form a diamond, which is more structured.\n\nWait, another idea: The pattern could be that for each cell in the grid, if the cell is 0 and there exists a cell with a non-zero value either in the same column below it or in the same row to the right (or some direction), then replace it with 4. But I need to check.\n\nIn Example 0, the 4s are above the 6s. For instance, the 4 in row 0, column 3 is directly above the 6s in column 3. The other 4s around it could be diagonally adjacent. Maybe the 4s are placed in all positions that are in the same column as any 6, but above the highest 6 in that column, and also in adjacent columns.\n\nAlternatively, for each column that contains a 6, the 4s are placed in rows from the top down to the row just above the topmost 6 in that column. Then, perhaps forming a diamond by considering the minimum distance from the top.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are forming a pyramid shape where each level is determined by how far above the original structure they are. For example, in Example 0, the original 6s start at row 4. So rows 0-3 are filled with 4s in a diamond shape centered at the middle column. Each row's 4s are spread out symmetrically around the center, with the number of 4s increasing until row 3, then decreasing. Wait, but in the output for Example 0, the number of 4s increases until row 3 (the middle row of the grid), then decreases. So row 0 has 1 four, row 1 has 3, row 2 has 3 (wait, let me check the output again).\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,4,0,0,0] \u2192 1 four.\n\nRow 1: [4,0,0,4,0,0,4] \u2192 three 4s.\n\nRow 2: [0,4,0,4,0,4,0] \u2192 three 4s (positions 1,3,5).\n\nRow 3: [0,0,4,4,4,0,0] \u2192 three 4s in the middle.\n\nWait, this doesn't form a diamond. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me visualize it.\n\nRow 0: 4 is in the middle.\n\nRow 1: 4s at positions 0,3,6.\n\nRow 2: 4s at 1,3,5.\n\nRow 3: 4s at 2,3,4.\n\nSo it's more like a diamond pattern with each row's 4s offset. The 4s form a diamond centered at row 3, column 3. Wait, maybe the diamond is centered at the middle of the grid (since the grid is 7x7). The middle is row 3, column 3. The 4s form a diamond around that point. But how does this relate to the original 6s?\n\nThe original 6s are in the lower part of the grid. So the diamond of 4s is placed above them, centered in the grid. Maybe regardless of the original structure's position, the 4s are forming a diamond or some symmetric shape in the upper part of the grid. But in Example 1, the grid is 9x9. The 7s are on the right side, and the 4s are forming a diagonal from the top-left to the middle-left, then expanding into horizontal lines. This doesn't fit the diamond shape idea.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of each example's output as adding a certain shape to the input. For example:\n\nExample 0's input has a U-shape of 6s. The output adds a diamond of 4s above it.\n\nExample 1's input has a vertical structure of 7s on the right. The output adds a diagonal line of 4s from the top-left to the middle, then a horizontal band in the middle.\n\nExample 2's input has a square outline of 3s. The output fills the inside of the square with 4s and adds a pattern below.\n\nWait, Example 2's output: The first three rows have 3s. The third row of input is [3,3,0,0,3,3]. The output replaces the zeros with 4s. Then the next rows have 4s filling the area. So maybe the 4s are filling the convex hull or the enclosed area of the 3s.\n\nBut then the bottom two rows have 0s and 4s in a pattern. For instance, the fifth row (0-based index 4) in the input is all zeros. In the output, it's [0,4,4,4,4,0], and the sixth row (index 5) is [4,0,4,4,0,4]. This seems like a checkerboard pattern but not exactly. Maybe the 4s are placed in a pattern that alternates positions every other row.\n\nPutting this together, perhaps the rule is:\n\n1. Fill all enclosed areas (like the interior of a shape) with 4s. For example, in Example 2, the 3s form a square, so the inside zeros are filled with 4s.\n\n2. Additionally, for any zeros that are adjacent (in certain directions) to the non-zero elements but outside the shape, replace them with 4s in a specific pattern.\n\nBut this doesn't explain Example 0 and 1, where the 4s are not just filling enclosed areas. In Example 0, the 4s are above the U-shape, which is an open structure. So that's not an enclosed area.\n\nAnother idea: The 4s are filling the \"shadow\" of the original structure when light is cast from a certain direction. For example, if light is coming from the top, the shadow would be below, but in Example 0 the 4s are above. Alternatively, light from the left, shadow to the right. But in Example 0, the 4s are above, which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, imagine the original structure is a solid object, and the 4s represent some kind of reflection. For Example 0, the U-shape is reflected vertically to form a diamond above. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the 4s are forming a mirror image of the original structure along a certain axis. For Example 0, mirroring along the horizontal axis would flip the U-shape upwards, but the output's 4s form a diamond, not a flipped U. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions of 4s relative to the non-zero elements in each example.\n\nIn Example 0's output:\n\nThe 4s are in rows 0-3, columns varying. The 6s are in rows 4-6. So the 4s are all above the 6s.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 4s are mostly on the left side and middle rows. The 7s are on the right. So the 4s are to the left of the 7s.\n\nIn Example 2's output, the 4s are inside the 3s' square and below them.\n\nThis suggests that the 4s are placed in regions relative to the original non-zero structures. For example, above, to the left, and inside. But the pattern varies per example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are placed in all cells that are part of the minimal rectangle that encloses the original structure, but only in certain positions. For instance, in Example 0, the 6s form a structure that is 3 rows high (rows 4-6) and spans columns 1-5. The minimal rectangle enclosing them would be rows 4-6, columns 1-5. The 4s are placed in a diamond above this rectangle.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s form a certain mathematical shape based on the original structure's dimensions. For example, in Example 0, the original structure's height is 3 rows. The 4s form a diamond that is 4 rows high (rows 0-3). Maybe the diamond's height is the same as the original structure's height, but shifted upwards.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nLet's try to find another angle. Looking at the test input:\n\nThe test input is a 10-row grid. The original structure seems to be a sort of arrow made of 2s. Let's visualize it:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRows 3-6: same as row 2 but different row indices.\n\nRow 7: same as row 1.\n\nRow 8: same as row 0.\n\nRow 9: all zeros.\n\nSo the structure is a vertical line of 2s in column 1, connected to a horizontal line in rows 0 and 8 (columns 1-4). So it's like a vertical line with horizontal bars at the top and bottom, forming a sort of \"H\" shape or a vertical line with two horizontal lines.\n\nThe expected output would be to add 4s in a pattern similar to the training examples. Based on the previous examples, the 4s are likely to be placed around the 2s, possibly forming a diamond shape or a diagonal pattern.\n\nBut how to apply the pattern seen in the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the 4s form a diamond above the U-shaped 6s. The diamond is centered in the middle of the grid. The test input's structure is vertical, so maybe the 4s will form a diamond or another shape around it.\n\nAlternatively, since the 2s are in a vertical line, the 4s could be placed in a horizontal band around them or in a diamond pattern.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the 4s often form a symmetrical pattern relative to the original structure. For instance, in Example 0, the diamond is symmetrical around the central column. In Example 1, the diagonal line is symmetrical in a way.\n\nIn the test input, the structure is symmetric along the vertical axis (column 2 maybe?), so the 4s might also be placed symmetrically.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the 4s are filling all cells that are in the same row or column as a non-zero element but outside the original structure. But this might not hold for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each cell in the input, if the cell is 0 and there's a non-zero cell either directly above, below, left, or right, then replace it with 4. But that's more of a flood fill approach and may not fit the examples.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output, the 4s are not adjacent to the 6s. The 6s start in row 4, and the 4s are in rows 0-3, which are not adjacent. So adjacency is not the rule.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the 4s as a different layer or mask applied over the grid. The mask depends on the shape of the non-zero elements. For example, in Example 0, the mask is a diamond shape placed above the 6s. In Example 1, it's a diagonal line and horizontal band.\n\nAlternatively, the mask could be a mathematical transformation like a dilation or erosion. Dilation would expand the non-zero regions, but in the examples, the 4s are not expanding the original elements but adding new ones in specific patterns.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that the 4s are placed in cells that form a certain geometric shape relative to the original non-zero elements. For example, the 4s are the set of cells that are equidistant from two opposite edges of the grid, but this is vague.\n\nLet's try to see if there's a common mathematical pattern.\n\nIn Example 0, the 4s are in positions where the row index plus the absolute difference of the column index from the center equals a certain value. For instance, the center column is 3. For row 0, column 3: row 0 + |3-3| =0 \u2192 maybe. Row 1, columns 0,3,6: |0-3|=3, |3-3|=0, |6-3|=3. Row 1 + 3 =4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of row and column indices. For Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0, column 3: 0+3=3.\n\nRow 1, columns 0: 1+0=1; 3:1+3=4; 6:1+6=7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the Manhattan distance from the center point. For Example 0, center is (3,3). The 4s are in cells where the Manhattan distance is 3. For example, row 0, column 3: distance is |0-3| + |3-3|=3. Row 1, column 0: |1-3| + |0-3|=2+3=5. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's try to find a pattern for each example and see if there's a common rule.\n\nIn Example 0, the 4s are arranged in a diamond pattern. The diamond has its tip at row 0, column 3, then expands to row 3. The diamond's layers are:\n\nRow 0: middle.\n\nRow 1: left, middle, right.\n\nRow 2: positions 1,3,5.\n\nRow 3: positions 2,3,4.\n\nThen below that, the 6s are present. This diamond is centered at (3,3), the center of the grid. The original 6s are in rows 4-6, but the diamond is above.\n\nIn Example 1, the 4s form a diagonal from (0,0) to (3,3), then expand into horizontal lines. The 7s are on the right side. The diagonal might be filling cells where row == column, up to a certain point. Then, rows 4-6 have 4s in columns 0-7, except the last column (which is 7). So maybe the diagonal fills up to row 3, then fills all columns to the left of the 7s.\n\nIn Example 2, the 4s fill the inside of the 3s' square and then form a pattern below. The inside of the square is straightforward. The lower rows have 4s placed in a pattern that's a mirror or alternate pattern.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nThe test input's structure is a vertical line of 2s in column 1, with horizontal lines at rows 0 and 8 (columns 1-4). So it's like a vertical line with horizontal caps at the top and bottom. The structure spans from row 0 to row 8, column 1.\n\nIf the pattern is to add a diamond shape above the structure, but in this case, the structure is vertical and spans almost the entire height of the grid, there's not much room above. Alternatively, the 4s could be placed in a diamond shape around the vertical line.\n\nAlternatively, considering the training examples, perhaps the 4s are placed in a way that mirrors the structure. For example, the test input's structure is vertical, so the 4s could form a horizontal diamond around it.\n\nAlternatively, since the structure is vertical and centered around column 1, maybe the 4s will form a horizontal line or a pattern expanding to the sides.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of the test input's structure:\n\nRows 0 and 8 have 2s in columns 1-4. Then rows 0-8 have 2 in column 1. So the structure is a vertical line (column 1) with horizontal lines at the top and bottom (rows 0 and 8, columns 1-4).\n\nIf we look at Example 0's output, which added a diamond above the U-shaped 6s, perhaps the test input's output will add a diamond to the left or right of the vertical line. But the vertical line is on the left side (column 1), so maybe the diamond is to the right.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s form a diamond centered on the vertical line, extending to the right and left. For example, in each row where there's a 2, the 4s are placed symmetrically around it.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Example 1, the 4s formed a diagonal and horizontal lines to the left of the 7s, which were on the right. So for the test input, since the 2s are on the left (column 1), maybe the 4s are placed to the right of them, forming a diagonal and horizontal lines.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the 4s are placed in cells where the row index plus column index equals a certain value. For Example 1's diagonal part, the 4s are where row == column. Then in the middle rows, columns 0-7 have 4s. For the test input, maybe a similar diagonal from (0, some column) to (middle row, some column), then expanding to the right.\n\nBut this is still vague. Maybe we can look for the positions where 4s are added in each example and find a common rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s are filling cells that are in the same row or column as a non-zero cell but in a certain direction. For example, in Example 0, all cells above the 6s in their columns are filled with 4s in a diamond pattern. So for each column that has a 6 in a lower row, the cells above are filled with 4s up to a certain point.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, the 6s are in columns 1-5. The 4s in column 3 are filled from row 0 down to row 3, but columns 1,2,4,5 have 4s only in certain rows. So this doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 4s in a column depends on the height of the 6s in that column. For example, in Example 0's column 3, the 6s start at row 4, so the 4s are in rows 0-3. But this doesn't explain why other columns have 4s in different rows.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of the test input's expected output.\n\nThe test input's structure is a vertical line with two horizontal lines at the top and bottom. It's symmetric vertically. If the pattern is to mirror this structure with 4s, perhaps the 4s are placed in a diamond shape surrounding the vertical line. For example, each 2 in column 1 would have 4s placed in the same row but columns 0 and 2. Then, in adjacent rows, columns 1 and 3, etc., forming a diamond.\n\nLooking at the test input's first row: [0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. The output might replace the zeros around the 2s with 4s. For example, the first row could have 4s in columns 0 and 5 (but not sure). Or perhaps in a pattern similar to Example 0's diamond.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s could form a diamond around the vertical line. The vertical line is in column 1. So the diamond would have its center around column 1 and span multiple rows. For example, in the rows where the vertical line is present (0-8), the 4s could be placed in columns to the left and right, expanding outward as you move up and down from the middle.\n\nBut the test input's vertical line spans from row 0 to 8, so the middle is around row 4. Maybe the diamond is centered at row 4, column 1. The diamond would then extend to the left and right columns as you move up and down from row 4.\n\nFor instance, row 4 (the middle row) would have 4s in column 1 plus adjacent columns. Rows above and below would have 4s spreading out.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's imagine how that might look.\n\nRow 4 of the test input is [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output might have 4s in columns 0,2 around it. Then, rows 3 and 5 would have 4s in columns 0,1,2,3, etc., forming a diamond.\n\nBut this is purely speculative. Alternatively, the 4s could be placed in a pattern that surrounds the vertical line, such as creating a horizontal band around it.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling to find a clear pattern, maybe I should look for a rule that applies to all training examples and then apply it to the test input.\n\nAnother idea: In each example, the 4s are placed in cells that form a certain mathematical relation to the non-zero cells. For example, cells where the row index plus the column index is even, but only in certain areas. Or cells that are part of a certain mathematical shape.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s are placed in cells that form a diamond shape centered on the original structure, with the diamond's size determined by the structure's dimensions.\n\nIn Example 0, the original structure is 3 rows high. The diamond has 4 rows, which is one more than the structure's height. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the diamond's size is determined by the distance from the top of the structure to the top of the grid. In Example 0, the structure starts at row 4, so the distance from row 4 to row 0 is 4. The diamond spans 4 rows. So perhaps the diamond's size is equal to that distance.\n\nIn the test input, the structure starts at row 0 and ends at row 8, so the distance from the structure's top to the grid's top is 0. So maybe the diamond's size is zero, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0, the 4s form a diamond that is centered in the grid. The grid is 7x7, so center at (3,3). The original structure is below the center, and the diamond is above.\n\nIn Example 1, the 4s form a diagonal line from (0,0) to (3,3), then a horizontal band. The grid is 9x9, center at (4,4). The 4s' diagonal reaches the center row (row 4), then the horizontal band covers rows 4-6. The 7s are on the right side, so perhaps the 4s are filling the left side up to the center.\n\nIn Example 2, the 4s fill the inside of the square and create a pattern below. The square is 3x3, so the 4s fill the interior. Then, the lower rows have a pattern that's symmetric.\n\nFor the test input, the structure is a vertical line from row 0 to 8, column 1. The grid is 10 rows. The center row is around row 4.5. The 4s could form a diamond centered at row 4, column 1. The diamond would expand left and right as you move away from the center row.\n\nFor example, row 4 (center) would have 4s in column 1. Row 3 and 5 would have 4s in columns 0,1,2. Row 2 and 6 would have 4s in columns -1 (not possible), 0,1,2,3. But columns can't be negative. So perhaps row 2 would have 4s in columns 0 and 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the diamond would expand left and right from column 1, with each row away from the center adding more columns. For instance:\n\nRow 4: column 1 \u2192 4.\n\nRow 3 and 5: columns 0,1,2.\n\nRow 2 and 6: columns 0,1,2,3.\n\nBut the test input has 10 columns (0-9), so there's space. However, the original structure is in column 1, so expanding left to column 0 and right to column 2,3, etc.\n\nBut how does this apply to the test input's output? Let's try to think of what the output might look like.\n\nThe test input's structure is a vertical line with horizontal caps. The output's 4s would form a diamond around the vertical line. For example:\n\nRows 0 and 8 (the horizontal lines) would have 4s extending to the left and right. For row 0, columns 0 (left of 2s) and 5 (right of the 2s' horizontal line). But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s could form a horizontal diamond around the vertical line. For example, each row has 4s placed symmetrically around column 1. For row 4 (center), column 1 has 2, so the 4s would be in columns 0 and 2. Row 3 and 5, columns 0,1,2. Row 2 and 6, columns -1 (invalid), 0,1,2,3. But since columns can't be negative, maybe starting from column 0.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can be applied to the test input based on the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the output's 4s form a diamond above the original structure. In Example 1, they form a diagonal and horizontal band. In Example 2, they fill the interior and add a pattern below.\n\nAssuming that the pattern is to fill the convex hull or the minimal enclosing shape of the original structure, but in a certain way.\n\nFor the test input's vertical line with horizontal caps, the convex hull would be a rectangle covering columns 1-4 (from the horizontal caps) and rows 0-8 (the vertical line). The 4s could fill the area outside this rectangle but within certain bounds.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s could be placed in a diamond shape around the vertical line. Since the vertical line is in column 1, the diamond's center is column 1. The diamond's width increases as you move away from the center row (row 4).\n\nFor example:\n\n- Row 4 (center): 4s in columns 1-1 (just the center, but maybe none since the original is there).\n\n- Row 3 and 5: 4s in columns 0-2.\n\n- Row 2 and 6: 4s in columns 0-3.\n\n- Row 1 and 7: 4s in columns 0-4.\n\n- Row 0 and 8: 4s in columns 0-5.\n\n- Row 9: maybe none since it's all zeros.\n\nBut this is a guess. Alternatively, the 4s could form a diamond shape with the vertical line as the vertical axis.\n\nAlternatively, considering the original structure has a vertical line and horizontal caps, the 4s could form a diamond that widens horizontally around the vertical line.\n\nBut this is still unclear. Given the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps I should proceed to make an educated guess based on the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the diamond starts at the top and expands downward. Example 1's output starts at the top-left and expands diagonally and then horizontally. Example 2 fills the interior and adds a pattern below.\n\nThe test input's structure is a vertical line with horizontal lines at the top and bottom. It's possible that the 4s will form a diamond shape around the vertical line, possibly to the right or left, or symmetrically.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0, the original structure is in the lower half, and the 4s are in the upper half. In Example 1, the original structure is on the right, and the 4s are on the left. So maybe the 4s are placed in the opposite direction of the original structure's position.\n\nApplying this to the test input, where the structure is on the left (column 1), the 4s would be placed to the right of it.\n\nFor example, the 4s could form a diagonal line from the top-right down to the middle, then expand to the left. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s could be placed in a way that mirrors the original structure. For the vertical line in column 1, the 4s might form a horizontal line or another vertical line elsewhere.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's challenging. Given that, perhaps the best approach is to try to replicate the pattern seen in Example 0 and 1.\n\nIn Example 0, the 4s form a diamond shape above the original structure, centered in the grid. For the test input's vertical line, the diamond might be centered along the vertical line's column (column 1), but arranged horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, the diamond could be placed to the right of the vertical line. For instance, each row has 4s placed in columns increasing as you move away from the center row.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s could form a diamond shape that's vertical, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the training examples.\n\nThe final answer should replace certain zeros with 4s in a pattern that surrounds the original structure. For the test input, the 4s will likely form a diamond or diagonal pattern around the vertical line of 2s. For example, each row containing a 2 in column 1 will have 4s in adjacent columns, creating a diamond that widens towards the middle rows and then narrows.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the 4s often form a symmetric pattern. So for the test input, the 4s might be placed symmetrically around column 1. For instance:\n\nIn row 0, where the 2s are in columns 1-4, the 4s could be in columns 0 and 5 (mirroring the horizontal line).\n\nIn rows 1 and 7, the 2s are in columns 1 and 4. The 4s could be in columns 0, 2, 3, 5.\n\nIn rows 2-6 and 8, the 2s are in column 1. The 4s could be in columns 0 and 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Another possibility is that the 4s form a diamond shape centered at the middle row (row 4.5, but since it's even, perhaps row 4 or 5) and column 1.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Row 0 and 8: 4s in columns 0,5 (mirroring the horizontal line's start and end).\n\n- Row 1 and 7: 4s in columns 0,2,3,5.\n\n- Row 2 and 6: 4s in columns 0,2,3,4,5.\n\n- Row 3 and 5: 4s in columns 0,2,3,4,5,6.\n\n- Row 4: 4s in columns 0,2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nBut this is speculative and may not match the training examples' pattern.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the original structure is a vertical line with horizontal lines at the top and bottom, the 4s could form a diamond shape that connects the horizontal lines' ends. For example, the top horizontal line is columns 1-4. The diamond's top point would be at row 0, column 2.5 (but since columns are integers, perhaps columns 2 and 3). The diamond would then expand downwards.\n\nBut this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to draft an answer based on the assumption that the 4s form a diamond pattern around the vertical line, with each row's 4s expanding outward from column 1 as you move towards the middle rows and then contracting again.\n\nFor the test input, the output would look something like this:\n\nRow 0: 4s in columns 0 and 5 (mirroring the horizontal line).\n\nRow 1: 4s in columns 0, 2, 3, 5.\n\nRow 2: 4s in columns 0, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nRow 3: 4s in columns 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nRow 4: 4s in columns 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\nRows 5-6: similar to row 3-4.\n\nRow 7: similar to row 1.\n\nRow 8: similar to row 0.\n\nRow 9: all zeros.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Looking at Example 2, where the original structure is a square, the 4s filled the inside and created a pattern below. For the test input's vertical line, maybe the 4s are placed in the columns to the right of the vertical line.\n\nAnother possibility: The 4s form a diagonal from the top-right to the middle-right, then a horizontal band. For example:\n\nRow 0: 4 in column 9.\n\nRow 1: 4 in column 8.\n\nRow 2: 4 in column 7.\n\n... and so on until the middle rows, then fill to the left. But this is similar to Example 1's diagonal pattern.\n\nBut without more information, I'm not confident. \n\nConsidering that the test input's structure is vertical, and the training examples show that the 4s are placed in a pattern that complements the original structure's shape, perhaps the test output will have 4s forming a diamond shape around the vertical line. For each row in the original structure, the number of 4s increases as you move away from the middle row (row 4.5), creating a diamond.\n\nBut the answer needs to be concrete. Given that I'm struggling, I'll try to think of the test input and possible 4 placements.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the diamond's layers are as follows:\n\nRow 0: middle column.\n\nRow 1: columns 0, 3, 6.\n\nRow 2: columns 1,3,5.\n\nRow 3: columns 2,3,4.\n\nSo each row adds two more columns, centered around the middle. Applying a similar pattern to the test input's vertical line, which is in column 1.\n\nPerhaps the diamond is centered at column 1, and each row adds 4s in columns moving outward from column 1.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow 0: column 1.\n\nRow 1: columns 0,2.\n\nRow 2: columns -1 (invalid), 3 \u2192 but since columns can't be negative, maybe columns 0,2,3.\n\nBut this isn't matching the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, the number of 4s increases symmetrically around column 1. For example:\n\nRow 0 (top): 4s in column 1 \u00b10 \u2192 column 1.\n\nRow 1: 4s in columns 0 and 2 (offset \u00b11).\n\nRow 2: columns -1 and 3 \u2192 invalid, so maybe columns 0 and 2,3.\n\nBut this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the diamond's columns expand as you move down from row 0 to row 4, then contract. For example:\n\nRow 0: column 1.\n\nRow 1: columns 0,1,2.\n\nRow 2: columns 0,1,2,3.\n\nRow 3: columns 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nRow 4: columns 0,1,2,3,4,5.\n\nThen, it contracts back for rows 5-8.\n\nBut this would form a diamond expanding to the right. However, the original structure is on the left (column 1), so this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the diamond expands to the left and right. But given that the vertical line is in column 1, expanding to the right would make sense.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to provide an answer based on the best guess.",
