        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input lists and output lists, and I need to figure out how the input is transformed into the output. Let's start by looking at the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input. The input is a list of 9 elements, but actually, looking closer, each example's input is a 9x9 grid, right? Because there are 9 lines each with 9 elements. Then the output is 6 lines each with 6 elements. So the transformation might involve some kind of reduction from 9x9 to 6x6. How?\n\nLet me look at the input and output of Example 0. Let's take the first input row of Example 0: [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The corresponding output rows are [0,2,0,0,4,0], [2,2,2,4,4,4], etc. Wait, maybe each output row is derived from multiple input rows? Or perhaps there's a pattern where the 9x9 is divided into 3x3 blocks that are then converted into 2x2 or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is combining certain elements from the input. Let's see. For instance, in Example 0's first input row, the first three elements are 2,4,8. The output's first row is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. Hmm, perhaps the 8 is ignored, and the 2 and 4 are placed in specific positions. But how?\n\nLooking at another row in the input, like the third row in Example 0's input: [0,0,8,0,3,0,0,3,0]. The output for this row in the first output example is [0,1,0,0,6,0]. Wait, maybe the 8 is a separator or a fixed value that's ignored, and the numbers around it are being summed or counted. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are grouped into pairs or triples and processed in some way.\n\nAnother approach: notice that in the input grids, there are rows with 8s. For example, the third row in Example 0's input is all 8s. Similarly, in Example 1, the third row is all 8s. And in Example 2, the seventh row is all 8s. Perhaps the 8s act as a divider, splitting the grid into sections. Maybe the output is combining data from the sections above and below the 8s row.\n\nLooking at the output structure: Each example's output has 6 rows, which is half of the 9 rows in the input (since the 8s row is in the middle, maybe). Let's check the input for Example 0. The input has 9 rows, and the 3rd row is all 8s. Then the output has 6 rows. So perhaps the output combines the top 3 rows and the bottom 3 rows (excluding the middle 8s row and maybe the other rows). Wait, but 9 rows in input: 3 above, 3 below, and 3 in the middle. But the output has 6 rows. Maybe each of the 3 rows above is processed into 2 rows each, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 9x9 grid is divided into 3x3 blocks, and each block is converted into a value in a 3x2 grid. But the output is 6 rows of 6 elements. Wait, 6x6 would be 36 elements, but the input is 9x9=81 elements. So perhaps each 3x3 block in the input is converted into a 2x2 block in the output. Then 9 rows divided by 3 gives 3 sections vertically, each section's 3 rows would become 2 rows. Similarly for columns. So 3 sections vertically and 3 horizontally, each turned into 2, leading to 6x6. That could make sense. Let's check.\n\nFor example, in the input of Example 0, first row is [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. If we split this into three 3-element blocks: [2,4,8], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]. Each 3x3 block (from 3 rows and 3 columns) would be converted into a 2x2 block. How?\n\nWait, maybe each 3x3 block is processed into a 2x2 block by taking, say, the sum of the top-left and top-middle elements for one position, etc. Or perhaps taking the non-zero elements. Let's take the first input row of Example 0: first three elements 2,4,8. The first output row in the example is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. Hmm. Maybe in each 3x3 block, the first and second elements are taken, but ignoring the third (8). So in the first block [2,4,8], the 2 and 4 are kept. Then the output for this block would have 2 elements, but the output is 6 elements per row, so perhaps each row in the output is combining three blocks. Wait, maybe each output row is a combination of two input rows. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are acting as separators. For example, in Example 0's input, the third row is all 8s. The output seems to have two sections: the first three rows and the next three rows. Let's look at the output of Example 0. The first three output rows are:\n\n[0,2,0,0,4,0]\n\n[2,2,2,4,4,4]\n\n[0,2,0,0,4,0]\n\nAnd the next three are similar but with 1 and 6. Now, looking at the input, the first two rows are [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0], [1,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0], then the third is all 8s. Then the next rows have 3s. Maybe the top two rows are processed into the first three output rows, and the lower rows (after the 8s) are processed into the next three output rows.\n\nBut how? Let's take the first input row of Example 0: [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The first three elements are 2,4,8. Then followed by six zeros. The corresponding output's first row is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. So perhaps the 2 and 4 are placed in positions 2 and 5 (indices 1 and 4). Then the next input row is [1,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The second output row is [2,2,2,4,4,4]. Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's combining these two rows. The third output row is [0,2,0,0,4,0], same as the first. So maybe each input row contributes to two output rows, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the non-zero numbers from the input, but arranged in a specific way. Let's take the first input row of Example 0: [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The non-zero numbers are 2,4,8. But 8 is present in multiple rows. Maybe 8 is a separator, so numbers before 8 are in one part, and after are in another. But in the first input row, after 8 there are zeros, so maybe 2 and 4 are the relevant numbers.\n\nLooking at the output rows for Example 0, the first output row has 2 and 4 in positions 1 and 4. The second output row has 2s and 4s in the first three and next three positions. Then the third output row is same as the first. Then the next three rows have 1 and 6 in similar positions. The input's second row has 1,6,8. So 1 and 6. The output's fourth row is [0,1,0,0,6,0], fifth is [1,1,1,6,6,6], sixth is same as fourth. So maybe each input row (except the all 8s row) contributes to three output rows, but arranged in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is split into three parts of three elements each, and each part is converted into two elements in the output. For example, a 3-element group becomes a 2-element group. How?\n\nLooking at the first input row of Example 0: [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Split into three 3-element blocks: [2,4,8], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]. For the first block [2,4,8], maybe we take the first two non-zero numbers. Here, 2 and 4. Then, the next blocks are all zeros. So perhaps each block contributes two elements. So for the first input row, the output would be [2,4, 0,0, 0,0], but the actual output is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. Hmm. The 2 and 4 are placed in positions 1 and 4. Maybe each 3-element block is turned into two elements in the output, placed in specific positions. For example, the first three elements (2,4,8) become 0,2 and 0,4. Wait, how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 3-element block is processed by taking the first and second elements if they are non-zero, and ignoring the third (since 8 is a separator). So [2,4,8] becomes 2 and 4. Then each such pair is placed in the output row. But how to arrange them into 6 elements? For three blocks, each contributing two elements, that's 6. So each input row would be split into three 3-element blocks, each contributing two elements. For example, the first input row's first block [2,4,8] becomes [2,4], next block [0,0,0] becomes [0,0], third block [0,0,0] becomes [0,0]. Then, maybe these are combined into the output row as [2,0,4,0,0,0] or similar. But the actual output for the first row is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. So maybe the arrangement is different. Let's see: the output row has 6 elements. If each block contributes two elements, perhaps arranged in a staggered way. For example, the first block's elements are placed in positions 1 and 4. The second block's elements in positions 2 and 5. The third block's in positions 3 and 6. Wait, but that would require each block contributing two elements. Let's see:\n\nFirst block [2,4,8] \u2192 2 and 4 (ignoring 8). So positions 1 and 4.\n\nSecond block [0,0,0] \u2192 0 and 0 \u2192 positions 2 and 5.\n\nThird block [0,0,0] \u2192 0 and 0 \u2192 positions 3 and 6.\n\nSo combined, the output row would be [2,0,0,4,0,0], but the actual output is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. Hmm, that's different. Maybe the positions are shifted. Alternatively, perhaps each block's two elements are placed in alternating positions. Or maybe the first element of the block is placed in the first half of the output row, and the second element in the second half. For example, for the first block [2,4,8], 2 goes to position 0 (first position) and 4 to position 3 (fourth). Then the output row would be [2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], but again, the actual output is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. So perhaps the elements are shifted to the right or left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements are centered. For example, the first block's elements are placed in positions 1 and 4. Let's try that. So for the first input row:\n\n[2,4,8] \u2192 2 at position 1, 4 at 4.\n\nThen [0,0,0] \u2192 0 at position 2, 0 at 5.\n\nThen [0,0,0] \u2192 0 at 3, 0 at 6.\n\nBut the output row is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. Wait, if the positions are 1 and 4, then the row would be [0,2,0,0,4,0], which matches the first output row. So the first element of the block is placed in position 1, the second in position 4. The third element (8) is ignored. Then the next block's first element is position 2, second in position 5, and the third block's first in 3, second in 6. But if the next blocks are [0,0,0], their elements would be 0 in position 2 and 5, and 0 in 3 and 6. So combining, the output row would be [0,2,0,0,4,0], which matches exactly the first output row of Example 0. So that seems to fit.\n\nLet me check the second input row of Example 0: [1,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Split into blocks [1,6,8], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]. Then applying the same logic: 1 in position 1, 6 in position 4. The next blocks contribute 0s. So the output row would be [0,1,0,0,6,0], but in the output of Example 0, the fourth row is [0,1,0,0,6,0]. Wait, but in Example 0's output, the second output row is [2,2,2,4,4,4]. That doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps there's another rule.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, after the all-8s row, there are rows with 3s. Let's look at the fourth input row: [0,0,8,3,3,3,3,3,3]. The output's fifth row is [1,1,1,6,6,6]. Hmm. Wait, but the input's fourth row is split into blocks [0,0,8], [3,3,3], [3,3,3]. Then according to the previous rule, the first block's elements (0,0) would go to positions 1 and 4. The second block's (3,3) to positions 2 and 5. Third block's (3,3) to positions 3 and 6. So the output row would be [0,3,3,0,3,3], but the actual output is [1,1,1,6,6,6]. So that doesn't match. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from multiple input rows. For example, the first three input rows (before the all-8s row) contribute to the first three output rows, and the next three input rows (after the all-8s row) contribute to the next three output rows. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the first three input rows are:\n\nRow 0: [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [1,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nSo rows 0 and 1 are above the all-8s row (row 2). Then output has six rows, maybe three from rows 0 and 1, and three from rows 3,4,5, etc.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 0:\n\nOutput rows 0-2:\n\n[0,2,0,0,4,0]\n\n[2,2,2,4,4,4]\n\n[0,2,0,0,4,0]\n\nRows 3-5:\n\n[0,1,0,0,6,0]\n\n[1,1,1,6,6,6]\n\n[0,1,0,0,6,0]\n\nSo perhaps each pair of input rows (rows 0 and 1) are processed into three output rows. How?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is derived from input row 0, the second from row 0 and row 1, and the third from row 1. Then similarly for the lower part.\n\nBut let's look at the input rows 0 and 1. Their first blocks are [2,4,8] and [1,6,8]. The first output row for these is [0,2,0,0,4,0], which comes from input row 0. The second output row is [2,2,2,4,4,4], which might be combining 2 and 4 (from row 0) and 1 and 6 (from row 1) in some way. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are generated by taking each input row and creating three output rows by some transformation. For example, each input row (except the all-8s) is expanded into three output rows. But the output has six rows, which would correspond to two input rows contributing three each, but in Example 0, the first two input rows (rows 0 and 1) are followed by the all-8s row. Then the next three input rows (rows 3-5) have 3s and 8s, and the output rows 3-5 are derived from those.\n\nLooking at input row 3 in Example 0: [0,0,8,0,3,0,0,3,0]. The output row 3 is [0,1,0,0,6,0]. Wait, but where do 1 and 6 come from? The input row 3's blocks are [0,0,8], [0,3,0], [0,3,0]. Using the previous rule, the first block contributes 0 and 0 (positions 1 and 4), the second block contributes 0 and 3 (positions 2 and 5), third block 0 and 3 (positions 3 and 6). So the output row would be [0,0,0,0,3,3]. But the actual output row is [0,1,0,0,6,0]. This doesn't align.\n\nMaybe the pattern isn't directly about the input rows, but about the vertical columns. Let's look at the input columns. For example, in Example 0's input, the third column is all 8s except for rows 3-8. Maybe each column is processed in some way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output in Example 0, the first three output rows have 2 and 4, which are from the first two input rows. The next three have 1 and 6, which are also from the first two input rows. Wait, the first input row has 2 and 4, the second has 1 and 6. Then the output rows are:\n\nFirst three output rows: 2 and 4.\n\nNext three: 1 and 6.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first two input rows (before the all-8s) and the first three rows after the all-8s. For Example 0, the all-8s is row 2. Then rows 3-5 are the next three rows, which have 3s. The output's rows 3-5 have 1 and 6, which are from the second input row (row 1). Hmm, not sure.\n\nLet's try to find another approach. Looking at the output of Example 0, the first three rows have elements 2 and 4. These are the numbers from the first input row. The fourth to sixth rows have elements 1 and 6, from the second input row. So maybe each input row (before and after the all-8s) contributes to three output rows. So the first input row (row 0) contributes to the first three output rows, row 1 contributes to the next three. Then the rows after the all-8s row contribute to other output rows. But how?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the all-8s row is row 2, then rows 3-8 are other data. The output has six rows. Maybe the output is divided into two sections: top three and bottom three. The top three come from the first two input rows (rows 0 and 1), and the bottom three come from rows 3-5 (the first three after the all-8s). Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first three rows are:\n\n[0,2,0,0,4,0]\n\n[2,2,2,4,4,4]\n\n[0,2,0,0,4,0]\n\nThese are all related to 2 and 4, which are in input row 0.\n\nThen the next three output rows are:\n\n[0,1,0,0,6,0]\n\n[1,1,1,6,6,6]\n\n[0,1,0,0,6,0]\n\nThese are related to 1 and 6 from input row 1.\n\nSo perhaps each input row (before the all-8s) contributes three output rows, arranged in a specific pattern. For example, the first input row's numbers are spread into three output rows, with the first and third being the same and the middle one being a repeated version.\n\nSimilarly, the rows after the all-8s (rows 3-8) would contribute to another set of output rows. But in Example 0, the output only has six rows. Wait, maybe the all-8s row splits the input into two halves: the first three rows (0-2) and the last six rows (3-8). But the output has six rows. Hmm, perhaps the input is divided into two groups: the two rows before the all-8s and the rows after. Then each group is processed into three output rows. For example, the first group (rows 0 and 1) is processed into three rows, and the next group (rows 3-8) is processed into the next three. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the all-8s row is the middle, and the input is split into two halves: top 4 rows and bottom 4 rows? But Example 0 has 9 rows, so the all-8s row is row 2. Then the top two rows (0-1) and the bottom six rows (3-8). But that doesn't fit.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's look at the output structure. Each output row has six elements, possibly grouped into pairs. For example, in Example 0's first output row: [0,2,0,0,4,0]. This could be divided into three pairs: (0,2), (0,0), (4,0). But not sure. Alternatively, each output row has two sections of three elements each, but with some pattern.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is created by taking every third element from the input rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the output rows are half the length of the input rows (9 elements to 6), maybe each output element is derived from certain positions in the input row. For example, the first output element is the second input element, the second output element is the fifth input element, etc. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's first input row: [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. If we take elements 1 (4) and 0 (2), but the output has 2 and 4 in positions 1 and 4. Wait, maybe positions 1 and 4 in the output correspond to positions 0 and 1 in the input. For example, in the first input row, position 0 is 2, which becomes position 1 in the output (value 2), position 1 in input is 4, becomes position 4 in output (value 4). Then, the output row has zeros elsewhere. But how to explain this pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is formed by taking elements from even and odd positions of the input. Or specific columns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the input and output in terms of columns. For example, in Example 0's input, the first column is [2,1,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output columns might be formed by certain combinations.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's look at another example. Example 1's input has a row [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,2]. The corresponding output rows include [0,0,1,2,0,2]. Maybe the 8 is ignored, and the 1 and 2 are placed in the output. So 1 and 2 are in positions 2 and 3 and 5 of the output row. How?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers after the 8 in the input row are taken. For example, in [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,2], after 8 comes 1 and 2. These are placed in the output as 1 and 2. The output row is [0,0,1,2,0,2]. So the 1 is in position 2, the 2 is in positions 3 and 5. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the non-zero numbers from the input and arranging them in a certain pattern, possibly with repetition. For example, in Example 0's first input row, non-zero numbers are 2,4,8. Ignoring 8, we have 2 and 4. The first output row is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. Then the second output row is [2,2,2,4,4,4], which repeats each number three times. Then the third row is same as the first. So maybe each input row's non-zero numbers (excluding 8) are arranged in the first and third output rows with single instances and in the middle row with triple instances.\n\nSimilarly, the fourth output row in Example 0 is [0,1,0,0,6,0], then the fifth is [1,1,1,6,6,6], then the sixth again like the fourth. This pattern matches the second input row's non-zero numbers (1 and 6). So perhaps each input row (excluding the all-8s) contributes three output rows: the first with the numbers in positions 1 and 4, the second with them repeated three times each in positions 0-2 and 3-5, and the third again like the first.\n\nBut why would there be three output rows per input row? For Example 0, there are two input rows before the all-8s (rows 0 and 1), each contributing three output rows, making six total. That fits. Then the input rows after the all-8s (rows 3-8) would contribute to another set, but in Example 0, the output only has six rows. Wait, but the example's output has six rows, which would be two input rows each contributing three rows. That makes sense. So the pattern is:\n\nFor each input row (excluding the all-8s row), generate three output rows:\n\n1. The first and second non-zero numbers (ignoring 8) placed in positions 1 and 4.\n\n2. Those numbers each repeated three times in the first three and next three positions.\n\n3. Same as the first row.\n\nIf that's the case, then for input row 0 (non-zero numbers 2 and 4):\n\n- Output row 0: [0,2,0,0,4,0]\n\n- Output row 1: [2,2,2,4,4,4]\n\n- Output row 2: [0,2,0,0,4,0]\n\nWhich matches Example 0's output.\n\nSimilarly, input row 1 has non-zero numbers 1 and 6:\n\n- Output row 3: [0,1,0,0,6,0]\n\n- Output row 4: [1,1,1,6,6,6]\n\n- Output row 5: [0,1,0,0,6,0]\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nNow, what about the input rows after the all-8s row? For Example 0, rows 3-8. But in the output, there are only six rows. So perhaps only the first two input rows (before the all-8s) are considered, and the rows after are processed similarly but in other examples. Wait, in Example 0, the output has six rows, all from the first two input rows. But looking at other examples:\n\nIn Example 1's input, there are rows after the all-8s. For example, input rows 3-8 have some numbers, and the output includes rows like [0,0,0,0,1,0], [4,4,4,1,1,1], etc. So perhaps the rows after the all-8s are also processed similarly. So the pattern is that the input is divided into sections separated by the all-8s rows, and each section's input rows are processed into three output rows each.\n\nIn Example 0, there's one all-8s row (row 2). The input rows above it (0 and 1) are processed into the first six output rows (3 rows each?), but in Example 0's output, there are six rows, so two input rows, three each. Then in Example 1's input, there's an all-8s row (row 2), and rows after (3-8) contribute to other output rows. Let's check Example 1's output:\n\nExample 1's output has six rows. Let's see:\n\nFirst three rows:\n\n[0,0,1,2,0,2]\n\n[1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,0,2,0,2]\n\nNext three:\n\n[0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\n[4,4,4,1,1,1]\n\n[0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nThe first three rows seem to come from the first two input rows (before the all-8s). Let's check:\n\nInput row 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,2]. Non-zero numbers after 8: 1 and 2. So the three output rows would be:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0,0,2,0]\n\nBut the actual first output row is [0,0,1,2,0,2]. Hmm, not matching. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair of input rows before the all-8s are processed into three output rows each. But I'm getting confused.\n\nLet's take another approach. Let's look at the output for the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nRow 1: [3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0]\n\nRow 2: [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0]\n\nRow 3: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nRow 4: [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0]\n\nRow 5: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nRow 6: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,1]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,4,7]\n\nSo the all-8s row is row 6. So the input is split into two parts: rows 0-5 (before row 6) and rows 7-8 (after row 6). According to previous examples, each input row before the all-8s contributes three output rows. But rows 0-5 are six rows, which would contribute 6 * 3 = 18 output rows, but the previous examples have only six output rows. So this suggests that perhaps only certain rows are considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is split into two halves by the all-8s row, and each half is processed into three output rows. For example, the first half (rows 0-5) is processed into three output rows, and the second half (rows 7-8) into another three. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input: before all-8s, two rows (0 and 1) processed into three each, making six output rows. Then after all-8s, no processing. But in Example 1's input, after the all-8s row, there are more rows, and the output includes data from those. So perhaps the processing is done for each group of two input rows before and after the all-8s.\n\nAlternatively, the all-8s row separates the input into two parts, and each part is processed into three output rows. For example, the first part (rows before all-8s) are processed into three output rows, and the second part (rows after) into another three. But in Example 0, the first part has two input rows leading to six output rows. So maybe each input row in each section contributes to three output rows. For example, two input rows before all-8s contribute 3 each, leading to six output rows. Similarly, two input rows after all-8s would contribute another six, but in Example 0's output, there are six rows, suggesting that only the first two input rows are processed. But this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, the all-8s row divides the input into two halves. Each half is processed into three output rows. For example, the first half (rows 0-2) in Example 0, but row 2 is all-8s. So perhaps the first half is rows 0-1, the second half rows 3-5. Each of these halves contributes three output rows.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nFirst half (rows 0-1) processed into three output rows each. Wait, that's six rows, but the output has six rows. So perhaps each half contributes three output rows, not three per row. For example, first half (two rows) processed into three output rows, and second half (three rows) into three output rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two input rows (before the all-8s) are processed into three output rows, and the first three input rows after the all-8s are processed into three output rows. For Example 0, after the all-8s, rows 3-5 are processed into three output rows. But in Example 0's output, the first three rows are from rows 0-1, and the next three from rows 3-5.\n\nBut how to process two input rows into three output rows. Maybe by combining them. For example, rows 0 and 1 are merged into three output rows. Let's see:\n\nRow 0: [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [1,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nNon-zero numbers (excluding 8): 2,4 in row 0; 1,6 in row 1.\n\nOutput rows 0-2: [0,2,0,0,4,0], [2,2,2,4,4,4], [0,2,0,0,4,0]\n\nRows 3-5: [0,1,0,0,6,0], [1,1,1,6,6,6], [0,1,0,0,6,0]\n\nSo it's as if each input row is processed into three output rows, with the middle row being the repetition of the two numbers three times each, and the first and third rows having the numbers once each. So for each input row, three output rows are generated.\n\nIn that case, the total number of output rows would be 3 * number of input rows processed. But in Example 0, there are two input rows processed (0 and 1), leading to 6 output rows. Then, the rows after the all-8s (3-5) are processed similarly, but in Example 0's output, there are only six rows. So perhaps the rows after the all-8s are not processed in the output. But Example 1's output includes rows that correspond to after the all-8s input rows. So perhaps only the rows before the all-8s and the rows after are processed, each contributing three output rows per input row.\n\nBut how to reconcile with the examples. Let's look at Example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2's input has an all-8s row at row 6. So the input rows before are 0-5 and after are 7-8. The output has six rows. Let's look at the output:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n0: [0,0,2,0,0,4]\n\n1: [0,0,2,0,0,4]\n\n2: [2,2,0,4,4,0]\n\n3: [0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\n4: [0,6,0,5,0,0]\n\n5: [0,6,0,0,0,5]\n\nLooking at input rows before the all-8s (rows 0-5):\n\nRow 0: [0,0,8,0,0,3,0,0,3]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,8,0,0,3,0,0,3]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,8,3,3,0,3,3,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,8,0,3,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,8,0,3,0,0,0,3]\n\nBut the all-8s row is row 6, so rows 0-5 are before. But the output has six rows, which would suggest that each of these six rows is processed into one output row. But the output rows seem to have patterns similar to previous examples. For example, output row 0 and 1 are the same, which might correspond to input rows 0 and 1. Let's look at input row 0: [0,0,8,0,0,3,0,0,3]. The non-zero numbers after 8 are 0,0,3,0,0,3 \u2192 but wait, after 8 is the fourth element, which is 0. Wait, the input row is split as follows: first three elements [0,0,8], then next three [0,0,3], then next three [0,0,3]. So ignoring the 8, the non-zero numbers are 3 and 3. So the output row for this would have 3 and 3. But the first output row is [0,0,2,0,0,4]. Hmm, not matching. So perhaps another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers before the 8 in the input row are considered. For example, in row 0 of Example 2's input: [0,0,8,0,0,3,0,0,3]. The 8 is in position 2. The elements before 8 are [0,0], and after are [0,0,3,0,0,3]. But that doesn't help.\n\nLooking at the output row 0: [0,0,2,0,0,4]. The numbers 2 and 4 might be from the input rows after the all-8s. Because the input's rows 7 and 8 are [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0] and [6,5,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So their non-zero numbers are 2,4 and 6,5. The output rows 4 and 5 have 6 and 5. So perhaps the output is formed from the rows after the all-8s.\n\nSo in Example 2's output, rows 0-2 are derived from rows after the all-8s (rows 7-8). For example, row 7: [2,4,8...], non-zero numbers 2 and 4. So output rows 0-2 would be:\n\n[0,2,0,0,4,0], [2,2,2,4,4,4], [0,2,0,0,4,0]. But Example 2's first three output rows are:\n\n[0,0,2,0,0,4]\n\n[0,0,2,0,0,4]\n\n[2,2,0,4,4,0]\n\nThis is different. So perhaps the processing is different for rows after the all-8s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows after the all-8s are processed similarly to the rows before. For example, input rows 7 and 8 (after all-8s) contribute to the output. Row 7: [2,4,8,...] \u2192 2 and 4. Row 8: [6,5,8,...] \u21926 and5. So the output rows would be:\n\nFor row 7:\n\n[0,2,0,0,4,0]\n\n[2,2,2,4,4,4]\n\n[0,2,0,0,4,0]\n\nFor row 8:\n\n[0,6,0,0,5,0]\n\n[6,6,6,5,5,5]\n\n[0,6,0,0,5,0]\n\nBut the actual output for Example 2 includes:\n\nRow 4: [0,6,0,5,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,6,0,0,0,5]\n\nWhich doesn't match. So maybe the pattern is not the same for all rows. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for common patterns in the output structure.\n\nIn each training example's output:\n\n- The output has pairs of rows that are the same, and a middle row with repeated elements.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,0,0,4,0]\n\nRow 1: [2,2,2,4,4,4]\n\nRow 2: [0,2,0,0,4,0]\n\nRows 3-5 follow the same pattern with 1 and 6.\n\nSimilarly, Example 1's output has:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,1,2,0,2]\n\nRow 1: [1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [1,1,0,2,0,2]\n\nRows 3-5 have a similar structure with 1 and 4.\n\nExample 2's output:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,2,0,0,4]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,2,0,0,4]\n\nRow 2: [2,2,0,4,4,0]\n\nRows 3-5 have different patterns but similar structures.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each input row (before or after the all-8s), three output rows are generated: a row with the numbers placed in certain positions, a row with those numbers repeated three times each, and another row like the first.\n\nBut how are the numbers selected from the input row?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input row 7: [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Non-zero numbers are 2 and 4 (ignoring 8). The output row 0 is [0,0,2,0,0,4]. So 2 is in position 2 and 4 in position 5. This is different from Example 0's placement.\n\nHmm, so maybe the positions where the numbers are placed depend on their position in the input row. For example, in Example 0's first input row, the non-zero numbers are in positions 0 and 1 (2 and 4). In the output row, they are placed in positions 1 and 4. In Example 2's input row 7, the non-zero numbers are in positions 0 and 1 (2 and 4), and in the output row 0, they are placed in positions 2 and 5. So the positions in the output row are shifted by 2 compared to the input positions. But this isn't consistent with Example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions are determined by the position after the 8. For example, in Example 0's first input row: [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 8 is in position 2. The numbers after 8 are all zeros. So perhaps the non-zero numbers before the 8 are considered. In this case, 2 and 4 are before the 8. So their positions are in the first part of the output row. But in Example 2's row 7: [2,4,8,...], the 2 and 4 are before the 8. In the output row, they are placed in positions 2 and 5.\n\nWait, maybe the output row is divided into two halves. The first three elements and the next three. The numbers before the 8 are placed in the first half, and the numbers after the 8 in the second half. For Example 0's first input row: before 8 are 2 and 4. So they are placed in the first half. But the output row has 2 in position 1 and 4 in position 4 (which is in the second half). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers before the 8 are placed in the first half of the output row, and the numbers after the 8 in the second half. For Example 0's first input row, before 8 are 2 and 4, after are zeros. So the first half has 2 and 4. But the output row is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. So 2 is in position 1 (first half) and 4 in position 4 (second half). So maybe each number before the 8 is placed in the first half and each after in the second. But in this case, both are before the 8. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are placed in the output row based on their position relative to the 8 in the input row. For example, in Example 0's first input row, the 8 is at index 2. The numbers before 8 are at indices 0 and 1 (2 and 4). These are placed in the output row's indices 1 and 4. So, index 0 in input \u2192 output index 1, index 1 \u2192 output index 4. That's a pattern. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's second input row: [1,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 8 is at index 2. The numbers before are 1 (index 0) and 6 (index 1). In the output row 3, they are at positions 1 and 4. Which matches.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,2]. The 8 is at index 6. Numbers after 8 are at indices 7 and 8 (1 and 2). In the output row 0, these are at positions 2 and 3, and 5. The output row is [0,0,1,2,0,2]. So 1 is at position 2, 2 at 3 and 5. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother example: Example 1's input row 7: [3,3,3,3,3,3,8,0,0]. Numbers before 8 are 3s. The output row is [4,4,4,1,1,1]. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Let's try to think of another angle. Maybe the output is a transformation where each input row is split into three parts, each part generating two elements in the output row. For example, each trio of elements in the input row is reduced to two elements in the output. For instance, taking the first two elements of each trio, ignoring the third (which is 8). So for each trio [a, b, 8], the output is [a, b].\n\nApplying this to Example 0's first input row: [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Split into three trios:\n\n[2,4,8] \u2192 2,4\n\n[0,0,0] \u2192 0,0\n\n[0,0,0] \u2192 0,0\n\nSo the output row would be [2,0,4,0,0,0], but the actual output is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. Not matching. But perhaps the order is different. Maybe the trios are processed in a way that the first element is placed in the second position of the output trio, and the second element in the fifth position. For example:\n\nFor trio [2,4,8], place 2 in position 1 and 4 in position 4.\n\nFor the next trio [0,0,0], place 0 in position 2 and 0 in position 5.\n\nFor the last trio [0,0,0], place 0 in position 3 and 0 in position 6 (but the output row only has six positions, so index 3 and 6? Wait, indices 0-5. So perhaps for each trio, the two elements are placed in positions (0,3), (1,4), (2,5). For example, the first trio's elements go to positions 0 and 3, second to 1 and 4, third to 2 and 5.\n\nLet's try that for Example 0's first input row:\n\nTrios:\n\nTrio 0: [2,4,8] \u2192 2 and 4 \u2192 positions 0 and 3.\n\nTrio 1: [0,0,0] \u2192 0 and 0 \u2192 positions 1 and 4.\n\nTrio 2: [0,0,0] \u2192 0 and 0 \u2192 positions 2 and 5.\n\nSo the output row would be [2,0,0,4,0,0]. But the actual output is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the first trio's elements are placed in positions 1 and 4, the second in 2 and 5, the third in 3 and 6 (which doesn't exist). So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, for each trio, the elements are placed in positions increasing by one each. For example, first trio's first element at position 0, second at 3; second trio's first at 1, second at 4; third trio's first at 2, second at 5. For Example 0's first input row:\n\nTrio0: 2 and 4 \u2192 positions 0 and 3 \u2192 [2, _, _,4, _, _].\n\nTrio1: 0 and 0 \u2192 positions 1 and 4 \u2192 [2,0,_,4,0, _].\n\nTrio2: 0 and 0 \u2192 positions 2 and 5 \u2192 [2,0,0,4,0,0].\n\nBut the actual output is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is a mirror or reflection of the input. For example, the first half of the input row is reversed and combined with the second half. But in Example 0's first input row, the first five elements are [2,4,8,0,0]. Reversed first half would be [8,4,2], but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input. For example, columns 1 and 4, but this seems arbitrary.\n\nPerhaps the key is to look for the non-zero numbers in each input row (excluding 8) and arrange them in the output rows with a specific pattern. For each such number, they appear in three output rows: once in a specific position, then repeated three times, then once again. And their position in the output depends on their position in the input row.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's first input row, the numbers 2 (position 0) and 4 (position 1) are placed in output positions 1 and 4. Then in the middle row, they are repeated three times each in their respective halves.\n\nSo for each number in the input row (excluding 8 and zeros), the position in the output is determined by their input column index. For example, input column 0 \u2192 output position 1, input column 1 \u2192 output position 4. Then, when repeated, they occupy the first three and next three positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input row 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,2]. The numbers after 8 are 1 (position 7) and 2 (position 8). In the output row 0, they are placed in positions 2 and 3, and 5. Output row is [0,0,1,2,0,2]. So 1 is at 2, 2 at 3 and 5. So perhaps the input column index minus 7 (since 8 is at index 6) gives the output position. For example, input index 7: 7 - 6 =1, but output position 2. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the position after 8 is considered. For input row 0 of Example 1, after 8 (index 6), there are elements at 7,8: 1 and 2. These are placed in output positions 2 and 3, and 5. Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for a pattern between input and output in terms of the numbers and their positions.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 0: [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Output rows 0-2 are focused on 2 and 4. Output row 0: 2 at position 1,4 at 4. Row 1: 2s and 4s repeated. Row 2: same as row 0.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,2]. Output rows 0-2 have 1 and 2. Output row 0: 1 at 2, 2 at 3 and 5. Row 1: 1s at 0-2, and 0s elsewhere. Row 2: 1s at 0-1, 2 at 3 and 5.\n\nThis suggests that the position of the numbers in the input affects where they're placed in the output. For example, if a number is in column 7 (after 8), it's placed in position 2 or 3 in the output.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers after 8 are mapped to the output's second half. For example, input row 0 in Example 1 has numbers 1 and 2 after 8 (columns 7 and 8). The output row's second half (positions 3-5) has 2 and 2. But in the output row 0, position 3 is 2, position 5 is 2.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps the pattern is that each input row is processed into three output rows by taking the first two non-zero numbers (excluding 8), and placing them in specific positions. The first output row has them in positions 1 and 4, the second row has them repeated three times in the first three and next three positions, and the third row same as the first.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nThe test input has an all-8s row at row 6. The rows before are 0-5, and after are 7-8.\n\nLet's look at the rows after the all-8s:\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,1]. Non-zero numbers after 8 are 2 and 1 (columns 7 and 8).\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,4,7]. Non-zero numbers after 8 are 4 and 7 (columns 7 and 8).\n\nSo for row 7: numbers 2 and 1. The first output row for this would be [0,2,0,0,1,0], then [2,2,2,1,1,1], then [0,2,0,0,1,0].\n\nFor row 8: numbers 4 and 7. Output rows would be [0,4,0,0,7,0], [4,4,4,7,7,7], [0,4,0,0,7,0].\n\nBut in the test input's output, there are six rows. So perhaps the first three rows are from the two rows after the all-8s (rows 7 and 8), each contributing three rows. But that would make six rows.\n\nBut according to the previous examples, each input row contributes three output rows. So the test input's rows 7 and 8 would generate 3 rows each, totaling six rows.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nRow 7: 2 and 1.\n\nOutput rows would be:\n\n[0,2,0,0,1,0]\n\n[2,2,2,1,1,1]\n\n[0,2,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow 8:4 and7.\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[0,4,0,0,7,0]\n\n[4,4,4,7,7,7]\n\n[0,4,0,0,7,0]\n\nBut combining these would result in six rows. However, looking at the outputs of the examples, the order is that the first three rows are from the first input row (before all-8s), next three from the second. But in the test case, the rows after all-8s are rows 7 and 8, so their output would be:\n\nRow 7's three rows first, then row 8's three rows. But the example outputs suggest that each input row's three output rows are consecutive. For example, Example 0's rows 0-2 are from input row 0, 3-5 from input row 1.\n\nBut according to the test input, if rows 7 and 8 are processed, their output rows would be:\n\nFor row 7: three rows.\n\nFor row 8: three rows.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow 1: [2,2,2,1,1,1]\n\nRow 2: [0,2,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,4,0,0,7,0]\n\nRow 4: [4,4,4,7,7,7]\n\nRow 5: [0,4,0,0,7,0]\n\nBut looking at the test input's rows before the all-8s (rows 0-5), they might also contribute to the output. But according to previous examples, perhaps only the rows after the all-8s are considered. For example, in Example 0, the first two rows (before all-8s) are processed into six output rows. In Example 2, rows after the all-8s are processed into some of the output rows. But this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the test input's rows after the all-8s (7 and 8) are processed into the output. So their non-zero numbers are 2,1 and 4,7. \n\nApplying the pattern:\n\nFor row 7: 2 and 1.\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[0,2,0,0,1,0]\n\n[2,2,2,1,1,1]\n\n[0,2,0,0,1,0]\n\nFor row 8:4 and7.\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[0,4,0,0,7,0]\n\n[4,4,4,7,7,7]\n\n[0,4,0,0,7,0]\n\nSo the final output would be these six rows. But looking at the training examples, especially Example 1, the output sometimes combines numbers from different parts. But perhaps this is the correct approach for the test input.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to take these input arrays and transform them into the output arrays based on some rules observed in the training examples. Let's look at the examples one by one to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has 9 rows of 9 elements each. The output has 6 rows of 6 elements each. Hmm, so maybe there's a reduction in the size. Let's see how each output row is generated from the input.\n\nLooking at the first input row in Example 0: [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The corresponding output row is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. Wait, maybe they're taking certain elements from the input row. Let's check positions. The output has 6 elements. Let's see if each output element is a combination of certain input elements. For instance, the first element of the output row is 0. The input row starts with 2 and 4. Maybe the output is grouping elements in pairs and taking the non-zero ones?\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the input is split into triplets, and each triplet is processed into two elements. Because 9 elements divided by 3 gives 3 triplets, but the output is 6 elements. So 3 triplets become 6 elements. How?\n\nLooking at the first input row [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Let's split into triplets: [2,4,8], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]. The output row is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. Hmm, the first triplet [2,4,8] might be transformed into 0 and 2. But how? Maybe 2 and 4 are non-zero, but 8 is perhaps a separator? Wait, in all examples, the input arrays have 8s in certain positions. Looking at Example 0's input, the third row is all 8s. The output for that row is [2,2,2,4,4,4]. So maybe 8s are acting as some kind of delimiter or indicating a section.\n\nWait, another observation: the input arrays are 9x9, and the outputs are 6x6. Maybe the input is divided into 3x3 blocks, and each block is processed into a 2x2 part in the output. But 9x9 divided by 3x3 blocks gives 3x3 blocks. So 3x3 blocks would become 2x2 each, leading to 6x6. That makes sense. So each 3x3 block in the input is transformed into a 2x2 cell in the output. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Split into 3 columns of 3 each: columns 0-2, 3-5, 6-8. Wait, maybe rows and columns are split into 3x3 grids. So the input is a 9x9 grid divided into 3x3 blocks (each of size 3x3). Each such block is converted into a single value in a 3x3 output. But the output here is 6 elements per row, which would be 2 elements per original 3 columns. Hmm, maybe the blocks are 3 columns wide and 3 rows tall, and each 3x3 block is mapped to a 2x2 block in the output. Wait, but the output has 6 rows and 6 columns. So 9 rows become 6, which suggests maybe overlapping blocks or some other processing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row of the input is split into three groups of three numbers, and each group contributes two numbers to the output row. Let's check that.\n\nTake the first input row of Example 0: [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Split into three triplets: [2,4,8], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]. The output row is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. Let's see. The first triplet has 2,4,8. The output for this triplet's position would be 0 and 2. How? Maybe taking the first two non-zero numbers? But 2 and 4 are the first two. But in the output, it's 0 and 2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe summing or some operation. Or perhaps 8 is a delimiter, and the numbers before 8 are considered.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the first row has 2,4,8 followed by zeros. The output row starts with 0,2. So maybe after the 8, the rest are zeros. But why 0 and 2? Maybe the first two non-zero elements before the 8. In the first triplet, 2,4,8. The 8 is the third element, so maybe the numbers before 8 (2 and 4) are taken. Then, in the output, perhaps 2 and 4. But the output has 0 and 2. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the position of the 8 is important. Let's look at other examples.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,2]. The output first row is [0,0,1,2,0,2]. So after the 8 in the input (position 6), the elements are 1 and 2. In the output, those elements appear as 1,2 in the third and fourth positions. But the output has six elements. Maybe each 8 in the input row acts as a separator, splitting the row into parts. For example, before the first 8 and after. But how does that translate into output elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are used to divide the input into regions. For example, in each row, the 8s split the row into left and right parts. Then, the left part (before the first 8) and the right part (after the last 8) are processed. Wait, but in the first example, the first row has 8 at position 2. The elements before are 2,4. The output row starts with 0,2. Maybe the first two elements before the 8 are taken, and the first two elements after the 8? But in the first row of Example 0, after 8, all are zeros. So output would take 2 and 4 (before 8) but in the output, it's 0 and 2. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the positions of 8s are important for vertical splits.\n\nWait, looking at the input arrays, each row has an 8 in the third position (index 2) in the first example. Wait, no. Let's check Example 0:\n\nFirst input row: [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 8 is at index 2. Similarly, the second row is [1,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The third row is all 8s. Then the next rows have 8 at index 2 again. So perhaps the 8s are acting as vertical separators. So each row is split into two parts: left of the 8(s) and right. But how to handle multiple 8s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire input is a 9x9 grid where the 8s form a vertical line down the middle. For example, in Example 0, the 8s are in column 2 (0-based), creating a vertical line. Then the left side is columns 0-2, and the right is 3-8. But that's not possible because the 8 is at column 2. So left is 3 elements, right is 6. Not sure.\n\nWait, another angle: the output in the examples has two parts. For instance, in Example 0's output, the first three rows and the next three rows. Looking at the output of Example 0:\n\n[0,2,0,0,4,0]\n[2,2,2,4,4,4]\n[0,2,0,0,4,0]\n[0,1,0,0,6,0]\n[1,1,1,6,6,6]\n[0,1,0,0,6,0]\n\nNoticing that rows 1 and 4 are filled with 2s and 4s, 1s and 6s. Maybe each input row is split into two parts (left and right of the 8), and each part is processed into two values. Then, for each of the three input rows, the left part contributes to the upper part of the output and the right part to the lower part. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is divided into two halves (left and right of the vertical line of 8s), and each half is processed into a separate 3x3 grid, which is then transformed into the output's upper and lower parts.\n\nBut the output has 6 rows. For example, in Example 0, the output has 6 rows. The input has 9 rows. So perhaps every three input rows contribute to two output rows. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's input has 9 rows. Output has 6 rows. So each group of 3 input rows becomes 2 output rows. Let's check:\n\nInput rows 0,1,2 (first three rows):\n\n[2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[1,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nThe corresponding output rows are:\n\n[0,2,0,0,4,0]\n[2,2,2,4,4,4]\n[0,2,0,0,4,0]\n\nSo rows 0-2 of input produce first three rows of output. Then input rows 3-5 produce next three output rows. But the third input row (row 2) is all 8s, which in output row 1 and 2, we see 2s and 4s. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe each input row is split into two parts: the left three elements (before the first 8) and the right elements (after the 8). Then each part is processed into a part of the output. For example, the left three elements contribute to the first half of the output, and the right elements contribute to the second half.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row: left part is [2,4,8], but the first 8 is at position 2, so maybe the left part is [2,4], and the right part is [0,0,0,0,0,0]. Then, the left part [2,4] is transformed into the first two elements of the output row. But the output row starts with 0,2. So maybe the non-zero elements. The left part has 2 and 4, which are non-zero, but output is 0 and 2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers before the first 8 in each row are considered for the left side of the output, and the numbers after the last 8 are considered for the right side. But in the first row, the first 8 is at index 2, and after that all zeros. So maybe the right side is considered after the last 8. But in some rows, there are multiple 8s. For example, in Example 0's fourth input row: [0,0,8,3,3,3,3,3,3]. The first 8 is at index 2, and then after that, all 3s. So the right part would be [3,3,3,3,3,3]. How is that processed into the output's second half.\n\nIn the output of Example 0, the first output row is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. The left part (first three elements: 0,2,0) and right part (0,4,0). Maybe each part is derived from the left and right of the input row.\n\nWait, another thought: the output seems to have two numbers per input group. For instance, in Example 0's first output row, the numbers are 0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0. Let's split into two parts: [0,2,0] and [0,4,0], but each part has three elements. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is divided into two sections, left and right, each three elements. For example, the first three elements of the output row correspond to the left part of the input row (before 8) and the next three correspond to the right part (after 8). But how?\n\nAlternatively, considering that each input row has an 8 in the third position (index 2), splitting the row into left (indices 0-2) and right (indices 3-8). Then, process each part into three elements in the output. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row: left is [2,4,8], right is [0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output row is [0,2,0, 0,4,0]. Maybe for the left part, the non-zero elements are 2 and 4. Then, perhaps the first non-zero is taken as the second element in the output's left part. But in the left output part, it's 0,2,0. Maybe the middle element is the first non-zero from the left part, and others are zeros. Similarly, the right part of the input has all zeros, so the right output part is zeros except the middle element. Wait, but in the first output row, the right part is 0,4,0. The input right part is all zeros. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the left part of the input is [2,4,8], and the 8 is a separator. So left part is [2,4], and the 8 is the separator. Then, the output's left part (first three elements) could be formed by the numbers before 8. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers before the first 8 in the row are considered as the left part, and the numbers after the last 8 as the right part. But in some rows, like Example 0's third input row, all elements are 8, so left and right parts would be empty.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output for the third input row (all 8s), the output is [2,2,2,4,4,4]. Maybe when the entire row is 8s, it acts as a separator between sections, and the output for this row is derived from the surrounding rows. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the input and output for the test input. Let's see if we can find any pattern in the numbers.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nThe first two input rows have 2,4,8 and 1,6,8. Their corresponding output rows have 0,2,0,0,4,0 and 0,1,0,0,6,0. So maybe the first non-zero numbers before the 8 are being placed in the second position of the left and right parts of the output. For example, in the first row, left part before 8 is 2 and 4. The output's left part is 0,2,0. The right part is 0,4,0. So maybe the first number (2) is placed in the second position of the left part, and the second number (4) in the second position of the right part. Then the third row (all 8s) becomes [2,2,2,4,4,4]. Which maybe takes the previous numbers (2 and 4) and fills the entire row.\n\nThen, the next three input rows (3-5) have 0,0,8 followed by various 3s. Their outputs are [0,1,0,0,6,0], [1,1,1,6,6,6], [0,1,0,0,6,0]. Wait, but where do 1 and 6 come from? The input rows 3-5 have 8 in the third position, and the numbers after 8 are 0,3,0, etc. But the output's right part uses 6. Hmm, maybe looking at other parts of the input. Wait, in the first input rows, the second row is [1,6,8, ...]. So maybe the 1 and 6 from there are being used in later outputs. But that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the input are grouped into pairs, and each pair is summed or multiplied. For example, in the first row, 2 and 4 might sum to 6, but that's not reflected in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first two non-zero numbers from the left and right of the 8 in each row. For example, in the first input row, left of 8 is [2,4], so the first two non-zero. The output left part (first three elements) has 0,2,0. Maybe the second element is 2. Then the right part of the input is all zeros, so the right part of the output is 0,4,0. But where does 4 come from? Unless it's from the second row's right part.\n\nWait, maybe each output row is constructed from two input rows. For instance, the first output row is from the first input row's left and the second input row's right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking vertically. Perhaps the output is constructed by looking at columns of the input and processing them. For example, the input is 9 columns, and the output is 6 columns, so each column in the output is derived from some combination of the input columns.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each output element corresponds to a 3x2 area in the input. For example, each 3x2 block in the input is compressed into a single element in the output. But how?\n\nLet's take Example 0's input and see:\n\nFirst input row: [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nIf we split into 3x2 blocks, but that's 3 columns and 2 rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking every other element from the input. For example, the first output row has 6 elements. The input row has 9 elements. If we take elements 0,2,4,5,7,8. But in the first input row, those would be 2,8,0,0,0,0. Doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a downsampled version. For example, taking every 1.5 steps, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the numbers in the output. In Example 0's output, the numbers 2 and 4 appear, which are present in the first input row. Similarly, in the next output rows, 1 and 6, which are from the second input row. The third output row (all 2s and 4s) may be combining the first two input rows. Then the next set of outputs (0,1,0,0,6,0) could be from the fourth input row, which starts with 0,0,8 and has 3s. But how 3s become 6? 3 is not present in the output. Unless it's summing pairs. Wait, 3+3=6. Maybe when there are multiple instances of a number in the right part, their sum is taken. For example, in input row 4 of Example 0: after 8, there are six 3s. Summing them gives 18, but in the output row [1,1,1,6,6,6], the right part is 6. So 6 could be 18 divided by 3. But 18/3 is 6. So maybe each group of three 3s is averaged. But this is speculative.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input row 4: [0,0,8,3,3,3,3,3,3]. The right part is six 3s. The output row is [1,1,1,6,6,6]. The right part of the output is 6. So 3*2=6, but six 3s would be 3*6=18. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the count of the most frequent number. Here, all are 3s, so count is 6. But 6 is present in the output. But how does the left part's 1 come from the input's left part [0,0,8]. Maybe the count of non-zero numbers. There are zero non-zeros, so why 1?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the counts or sums of certain numbers in specific regions. This seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output structure. Each output has six rows. The first three and next three might be mirror images or transformations. For example, in Example 0, the first three rows are:\n\n[0,2,0,0,4,0]\n[2,2,2,4,4,4]\n[0,2,0,0,4,0]\n\nNotice that the first and third rows are the same, and the second row is filled with 2s and 4s. Similarly, the next three rows follow the same pattern with 1 and 6. So maybe the pattern is that for every three input rows, the first and third output rows are the same, and the middle one is filled with the non-zero values from the first and third rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the first input row becomes the first output row, the second input row becomes the third output row, and the third input row (all 8s) becomes the second output row filled with the previous numbers. But in Example 0, the third input row (all 8s) corresponds to the second output row filled with 2s and 4s. Where do 2 and 4 come from? They are from the first input row's left part (2 and4). So maybe when there's a row of 8s, it creates a filled row using the previous two rows' non-zero values.\n\nSo in Example 0:\n\nInput rows 0: [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nInput row 1: [1,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nInput row 2: all 8s.\n\nOutput rows 0: [0,2,0,0,4,0] (from row 0)\nOutput row 1: [2,2,2,4,4,4] (from row 2, using the numbers 2 and 4 from row 0)\nOutput row 2: [0,2,0,0,4,0] (same as row 0?)\n\nWait, no. Output row 0 is from input row 0, output row 2 is the same. Then output row 1 is filled with 2 and 4, which are from input row 0's left part (2 and4). Then the next three output rows are from input rows 3,4,5. Input row 3 is [0,0,8,0,3,0,0,3,0]. Output row 3 is [0,1,0,0,6,0]. The numbers 1 and 6 are from input row 1's left part (1 and6). Then output row 4 is [1,1,1,6,6,6], filled with 1 and6. Output row 5 is same as row 3. So this pattern seems plausible.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n- For every three input rows, the first two are used to create three output rows: the first and third output rows are derived from the first and second input rows, and the middle output row is filled with the non-zero values from those two input rows.\n\n- Rows in the input that are all 8s indicate that the next output rows should use the non-zero values from the preceding two input rows.\n\nWait, let's see. For Example 0:\n\nInput rows 0-2:\n\n0: [2,4,8,...]\n1: [1,6,8,...]\n2: [8,8,8,...]\n\nOutput rows 0-2:\n\n0: [0,2,0,0,4,0]\n1: [2,2,2,4,4,4]\n2: [0,2,0,0,4,0]\n\nSo input row 0 contributes to output row 0 and 2. The filled row (output row1) has 2 and4, which are from input row0's left part. Then input rows 3-5 are:\n\n3: [0,0,8,0,3,0,0,3,0]\n4: [0,0,8,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n5: [0,0,8,0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nOutput rows 3-5:\n\n3: [0,1,0,0,6,0]\n4: [1,1,1,6,6,6]\n5: [0,1,0,0,6,0]\n\nSo here, output row3 is derived from input row3's left and right parts. But the numbers 1 and6 are from input row1's left part (1,6). Output row4 is filled with 1 and6, and output row5 matches row3.\n\nThis suggests that the all-8s row (input row2) triggers the filled output row using the non-zero values from the previous two input rows (rows0 and1). Then, the next three input rows (3-5) are processed similarly. But input rows3-5 have no all-8s row. Wait, input row4 is [0,0,8,3,3,3,3,3,3]. Not all 8s, but has 8 in position2. So maybe the all-8s row is a special case, and other rows follow a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe every third row is an all-8s row, and that's used to generate the filled row. But in the training examples, it's not consistent. Example1's input has the third row as all 8s. Example2's input has the seventh row as all 8s.\n\nWait, looking at Example1:\n\nInput rows:\n\n0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,2]\n1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,4,1]\n2: all 8s.\n3: [0,0,3,3,0,3,8,0,0]\n4: [3,3,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n5: [3,3,0,3,0,3,8,0,0]\n6: [0,0,0,0,3,0,8,0,0]\n7: [3,3,3,3,3,3,8,0,0]\n8: [0,0,0,0,3,0,8,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[0,0,1,2,0,2]\n[1,1,0,0,0,0]\n[1,1,0,2,0,2]\n[0,0,0,0,1,0]\n[4,4,4,1,1,1]\n[0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nThe output has 6 rows. So input rows0-2 contribute to output rows0-2, and input rows3-5 contribute to output rows3-5. But input row2 is all 8s. The output row1 is [1,1,0,0,0,0]. Hmm, how does this fit. The first two input rows (0 and1) have 8s in position6. So their left parts are [0,0,0,0,0,0], right parts are [8,1,2] and [8,4,1]. Wait, but in Example1's first input row, the 8 is at position6, so the left part is first 6 elements (all zeros), and the right part is [8,1,2]. But the output row0 is [0,0,1,2,0,2]. So the right part of the input row0's right part is [1,2]. The output's right part (last three elements) is 0,2. Not sure. Maybe the non-zero elements after the 8.\n\nInput row0: after 8 is 1,2. These are non-zero. So output row0's right part has 1 and2, but in the output row0, it's 0,2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each input row, we look for the first two non-zero numbers before and after the first 8. For example, in input row0 of Example0: before 8 are 2,4. After 8 are 0s. So output row0 takes 2 and4, placing them in the second positions of the left and right parts. Then when a row of all 8s is encountered, the next output row is filled with those two numbers. Then the following output row repeats the first one.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1's input row0: after 8 are 1 and2. So output row0's right part would take 1 and2, but in the output, it's [0,0,1,2,0,2]. Wait, the first three elements are 0,0,1, and the next three are 2,0,2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is formed by taking the first two non-zero numbers from the left part (before the first 8) and the first two non-zero numbers from the right part (after the last 8) of the input row. For example, input row0 of Example0: left part before first 8 (at index2) is [2,4], so first two are 2,4. Right part after last 8 is the rest of the row (indices3-8), which are all zeros, so no non-zero. So output row0 would be [0,2,0,0,4,0], placing 2 in the left part's second position and 4 in the right part's second position.\n\nInput row1 of Example0: [1,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Left part [1,6], so output row3 would have 1 and6. Output row3 is [0,1,0,0,6,0]. Fits this pattern.\n\nInput row3 of Example0: [0,0,8,0,3,0,0,3,0]. Left part [0,0,8] but first two non-zero before 8? The first non-zero in the left part is none. Right part after 8: [0,3,0,0,3,0]. The first two non-zero are 3 and3. So output row3's right part would have 3 and3. But the output is [0,1,0,0,6,0]. Hmm, this doesn't match. So maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother observation: the output rows alternate between sparse and filled. For example, in Example0, output rows0,2 are sparse (with 2 and4 in specific positions), row1 is filled with 2s and4s. Similarly, rows3 and5 are sparse with 1 and6, row4 is filled. So perhaps the filled rows are generated from the all-8s input rows.\n\nBut how to derive the numbers in the filled rows. For Example0's output row1: filled with 2 and4. These are from input row0's left part. Input row0's left part is [2,4,8], so the non-zero numbers before the 8 are 2 and4. Then the filled row uses those values. Similarly, output row4 uses 1 and6 from input row1's left part [1,6,8].\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n- The input is divided into groups of three rows. The third row in each group is all 8s.\n\n- For each group of three input rows (A, B, 8s):\n\n   - The first output row is derived from the left and right parts of row A.\n\n   - The second output row is filled with the first two non-zero values from row A's left and right parts.\n\n   - The third output row is the same as the first.\n\nThen, the next three input rows (C, D, E) might form another group, but not sure. Wait, in Example0, the input has 9 rows. Groups of three: rows0-2, 3-5, 6-8.\n\nFor the first group (rows0-2):\n\n- Row0: A\n\n- Row1: B\n\n- Row2: all 8s (C)\n\nOutput rows0-2: derived from A, C, A.\n\nBut output row1 is filled with A's numbers. So maybe when C is all 8s, the filled row is generated from A's non-zero values.\n\nSimilarly, the second group (rows3-5):\n\n- Row3: D\n\n- Row4: E\n\n- Row5: F\n\nBut none of these are all 8s. So how does this group produce output rows3-5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the all-8s rows are the separators between groups. For example, in Example0:\n\n- Input rows0-2: group1 (with row2 being all 8s)\n\n- Input rows3-8: group2 (but no all-8s row here). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is structured as follows: For every input row that is not all 8s, generate two output rows: one sparse and one filled. But in the training examples, the output has 6 rows for 9 input rows, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the all-8s rows in the input are used to create the filled rows in the output. Each all-8s row is followed by a filled output row using the non-zero values from the preceding two input rows.\n\nBut in Example0, the all-8s row is row2. The filled output row is row1. So the order is input row0, row1, row2 (all 8s) leading to output rows0,1,2.\n\nSo perhaps for each all-8s row in the input, we generate a filled output row using the previous two input rows' non-zero values.\n\nBut in Example1, the all-8s row is row2. The filled output row is row1: [1,1,0,0,0,0]. The previous input rows are rows0 and1. Their left parts are zeros and right parts after 8 are [1,2] and [4,1]. So how does that become [1,1,0,0,0,0]? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the filled output row combines the first non-zero from the left part of the first input row and the first non-zero from the right part of the second input row. For Example0's filled row (output row1: 2,2,2,4,4,4). The first input row's left part has 2 and4. The second input row's left part has 1 and6. But where does the 4 come from? The first input row's right part is all zeros. So maybe not.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to think differently. Maybe the output is formed by taking the first and second non-zero numbers from each half of the input rows. For example, each input row is split into two halves (left and right of the first 8). The first half contributes to the left side of the output row, and the second half contributes to the right side.\n\nFor Example0's first input row: left half is [2,4], so the first two non-zero are 2 and4. The output row is [0,2,0, 0,4,0]. So maybe each non-zero number is placed in the middle of a trio of zeros. Like, the first non-zero is in the second position of the left trio, the second non-zero is in the second position of the right trio. Then, if there are more non-zero numbers, they are placed elsewhere. But in Example0's first input row, there are only two non-zero numbers before 8, so the output's left trio is [0,2,0], right trio is [0,4,0]. Then, the third input row (all 8s) becomes [2,2,2,4,4,4], which fills all positions with the previous non-zero values. \n\nSimilarly, in Example0's fourth input row: [0,0,8,3,3,3,3,3,3]. Left part is [0,0,8], so no non-zero before 8. Right part is six 3s. So the output's left trio would be [0,0,0], and the right trio would be [3,3,3], but in the output row4, it's [1,1,1,6,6,6]. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Unless the numbers are summed or counted. Six 3s in the right part. Sum is 18. 18/3 =6. So each trio of 3s becomes 6. But how does 3 become 6? Maybe the sum of each three elements. So three 3s sum to 9, but output is 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the count of non-zero elements. For example, in the right part of Example0's fourth input row, there are six 3s. So the count is six. But output is 6. So each trio of 3s would contribute 2 to the count, but 6/3=2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of non-zero elements in each trio. For example, if there are three 3s in a trio, that's three non-zero elements. So output would be 3. But in output row4, it's 6. Not matching.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try to look at another example. Example1's output:\n\nFirst output row: [0,0,1,2,0,2]\n\nInput row0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,2]. The first 8 is at index6. Left part is first six elements, all zeros. Right part is [8,1,2]. So the non-zero numbers after 8 are 1 and2. The output row's right part is [2,0,2]. How does this happen? Maybe the first non-zero after 8 is 1, placed in the third position of the left trio. Wait, the output row is split into left and right. Maybe the left trio corresponds to the left part of the input row, and the right trio to the right part. But the left part of input row0 is all zeros, so output left trio is [0,0,1] (from 1 after 8?), and right trio is [2,0,2]. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the left trio of the output is the first three non-zero numbers before the first 8 in the input row, and the right trio is the first three non-zero numbers after the last 8. But in input row0 of Example1, there are no non-zero before the 8, and two non-zero after (1,2). So the right trio would be [1,2, ...], but output is [1,2,0,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first non-zero from the left and the first non-zero from the right of each input row. For each input row:\n\n- Left part (before first 8): take first non-zero, place in second position of output's left trio.\n\n- Right part (after last 8): take first non-zero, place in second position of output's right trio.\n\nIf there are no non-zero, then 0.\n\nThen, for the all-8s rows, we take the previous two rows' non-zero values and fill the output row.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's input row0: left part [2,4] before first 8. First non-zero is 2. Right part after last 8: all zeros. So output row0 left trio [0,2,0], right trio [0,0,0], but the actual output is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. So right part has 4. Which isn't from the right part of the input. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nHmm. Maybe the right part takes the second non-zero from the left part. For Example0's input row0, left part has 2 and4. Then, output row0 is [0,2,0,0,4,0]. So left trio's second element is 2, right trio's second element is4. So perhaps for each input row, the first two non-zero numbers from the left part are placed in the second positions of the left and right trios of the output. \n\nThen, for the all-8s input row, the output row is filled with those two numbers.\n\nFor example, input row0 has 2 and4. The all-8s row (input row2) generates an output row filled with 2 and4. So output row1 is [2,2,2,4,4,4].\n\nInput row1 has 1 and6. So output rows3 and5 would have 1 and6 in the positions, and the next all-8s row would generate a filled row of 1 and6. But in Example0, the next all-8s row is not present. Hmm.\n\nBut in Example0's input, the fourth input row is not all 8s. So this pattern may only apply when an all-8s row is encountered.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. For each input row:\n\n   a. Split into left part (before first 8) and right part (after last 8).\n\n   b. Take the first two non-zero numbers from the left part and right part.\n\n   c. In the output row, place the first non-zero from left part in the second position of the left trio, and the second non-zero from left part in the second position of the right trio. If there are not enough non-zero numbers, fill with zeros.\n\nBut this doesn't explain why in Example0's first output row, the right trio's second element is4, which is from the left part of the input row. So perhaps the right trio's element is from the left part's second non-zero, even if the right part has no non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, the left and right parts of the output are both derived from the left part of the input row. For Example0's first input row, left part has 2 and4. Output's left trio has 2 in the middle, and right trio has4 in the middle. So each input row's left part contributes to both left and right trios of the output row. The right part of the input is ignored. But then, what about the other examples where the right part has non-zero elements?\n\nExample1's input row0: left part (before first 8) is all zeros, right part (after last 8) is [1,2]. So output row0 would take first two non-zero from right part:1 and2. So output row0's left trio would have 1 in the middle, and right trio 2 in the middle. But the actual output is [0,0,1,2,0,2]. Hmm, the third element is1 and fourth is2, which would correspond to left trio third position and right trio first. This doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's look at the test input to see if applying any of these possible patterns would generate a plausible output.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 1]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 7]\n\nLooking for all-8s row: row6 is all 8s. So perhaps the output will have a filled row based on the previous two input rows (rows5 and4? Or rows7 and8? Wait, input row6 is followed by rows7 and8. But in Example0, the all-8s row is in the third position, and the previous two rows are used. Here, the all-8s row is row6. The rows after are7 and8. But according to previous examples, the all-8s row would be followed by using the previous two rows. But row6 is between rows5 and7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in Example0, the all-8s row is the third row, and the first three rows generate the first three output rows. Similarly, in the test input, the all-8s row is row6, which may be part of a group. Let's see:\n\nTest input has 9 rows. Rows0-5 are before the all-8s row (row6), rows7-8 are after.\n\nIn previous examples, the all-8s row is part of a group of three. So perhaps rows6-8 form a group. But row6 is all-8s, rows7 and8 have 8s in position6.\n\nAssuming that the all-8s row (row6) is followed by two rows (7 and8), then the output for these three rows would be:\n\n- Output row derived from row7 and row8, with row6's filled row.\n\nBut how?\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,1]. Left part (before8) is six zeros. Right part after8: [2,1].\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,4,7]. Left part six zeros. Right part: [4,7].\n\nSo the first two non-zero from row7's right part are 2 and1. From row8's right part are4 and7. But the filled row (due to row6) would be filled with 2 and4 (from row7 and8's left parts, but their left parts are zeros. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the filled row is created from the non-zero numbers of the previous two input rows. For example, row7's right part has 2 and1. Row8's right part has4 and7. So the filled row would have 2,1 in the left and4,7 in the right. But how to combine them into a filled row.\n\nAlternatively, the filled row uses the first non-zero from each of the previous two rows. Row7's right part: first non-zero is2. Row8's right part: first non-zero is4. So filled row would be [2,2,2,4,4,4], similar to Example0's output row1.\n\nThen, the output rows derived from row7 and row8 would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,0]\n[2,2,2,4,4,4]\n[0,0,0,0,2,0]\n[0,0,0,0,4,0]\n[4,4,4,7,7,7]\n[0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nBut this is just a guess. The actual test output needs to follow the pattern of the training examples.\n\nAnother observation: in Example2's output, the last three rows are:\n\n[0,0,0,0,5,0]\n[0,6,0,5,0,0]\n[0,6,0,0,0,5]\n\nWhich seems to correspond to input rows7 and8, which are [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0] and [6,5,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output's last three rows have 5 and6. So the first two non-zero numbers from the left parts of rows7 and8 are2,4 and6,5. But how they are placed in the output.\n\nIn Example2's output row4: [0,6,0,5,0,0]. The 6 is in the second position of the left trio, and 5 in the fourth. So perhaps each row's left part's first non-zero is placed in the second position of the output's left trio, and the second non-zero is placed in the fourth position of the output's right trio.\n\nFor row7 of Example2's input: [2,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Left part has 2 and4. Output row4 is [0,6,0,5,0,0]. So this doesn't fit. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps it's best to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn the test input, the all-8s row is row6. The rows after that are7 and8. So according to the pattern observed in the training examples, the filled row (middle of the output group) would be derived from the non-zero values in the previous two input rows. For row7 and8, their right parts after 8 are [2,1] and [4,7]. So the filled row would be filled with 2 and4 (first non-zero from each) or 1 and7 (second non-zero), but in Example0, it used the first non-zero values. So perhaps the filled row uses the first non-zero from each.\n\nSo filled row would be 2 and4, leading to [2,2,2,4,4,4]. Then the output rows would have:\n\nFor row7: [0,0,0,0,2,0]\nFor filled row: [2,2,2,4,4,4]\nFor row8: [0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the output rows for the test input might look like:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[2,2,2,4,4,4]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the all-8s row (row6) is followed by rows7 and8, which have 2,1 and4,7 after their 8s. So the filled row would be [2,2,2,4,4,4], and the other rows would be [0,0,0,0,2,0] and [0,0,0,0,4,0]. So the output might be structured as:\n\n[ ... other rows ... ]\n[0,0,0,0,2,0]\n[2,2,2,4,4,4]\n[0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nBut without knowing the full pattern, it's hard to be accurate.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the test input's rows7 and8. Both have 8 in position6. The left parts are all zeros. The right parts are [2,1] and [4,7]. So per the pattern from previous examples, the output rows would take the first non-zero from each of their right parts. So for row7: right part is [2,1]. First non-zero is2. So output row would have [0,0,0,0,2,0]. For row8: right part [4,7]. First non-zero is4. Output row [0,0,0,0,4,0]. Then the filled row between them would be [2,2,2,4,4,4].\n\nThus, the final part of the output for the test input would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,0]\n[2,2,2,4,4,4]\n[0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nBut how many rows are there in total? The test input has 9 rows. According to the training examples, the output has 6 rows. So the test input's output should be 6 rows. How to split the 9 input rows into groups to form 6 output rows.\n\nPerhaps the first six input rows are processed into four output rows, and the last three input rows (6-8) into two output rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is structured as two sections: the first half from the input rows before the all-8s row, and the second half from the rows after.\n\nThe test input's all-8s row is row6. Rows0-5 are before, rows7-8 after. So maybe the first four output rows are derived from rows0-5, and the last two from rows7-8 and the all-8s row.\n\nBut this is just speculation.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the patterns observed. For the test input's rows7 and8:\n\n- Row7: after 8 has [2,1]. First non-zero is2. Output row: [0,0,0,0,2,0].\n\n- Row8: after 8 has [4,7]. First non-zero is4. Output row: [0,0,0,0,4,0].\n\nThe all-8s row (row6) would generate a filled row using the previous two rows' non-zero values. But rows5 and6: row5's right part after 8 is zeros. So perhaps the filled row is based on rows7 and8's non-zero values. So filled row: [2,2,2,4,4,4].\n\nThus, the output for the test input might look like:\n\n[ ..., \n[0,0,0,0,2,0], \n[2,2,2,4,4,4], \n[0,0,0,0,4,0] ]\n\nBut the exact structure depends on the grouping.\n\nConsidering the examples, the output structure often has three rows per group. So the test input's output may have:\n\n- Rows from processing input rows0-5: possibly four rows.\n\n- Rows from processing input rows6-8: two rows.\n\nBut this is unclear.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, the final answer is likely:",
        "initial_response_2": "[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]  \n[3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]  \n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]  \n[0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0]  \n[2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4]  \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]  \n\nBut I'm unsure. The correct answer likely involves capturing the first non-zero elements before and after the 8s and filling rows when encountering all 8s. For the test input, focusing on rows7 and8's right parts (2,1 and4,7) and the all-8s row6, the filled row would use 2 and4. Thus, the last three output rows might be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,2,0]  \n[2,2,2,4,4,4]  \n[0,0,0,0,4,0]  \n\nBut without the full pattern, this is a best-effort guess.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]  \n[3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]  \n[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]  \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]  \n[2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4]  \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]"
