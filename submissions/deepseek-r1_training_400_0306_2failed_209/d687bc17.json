        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids based on the training examples. Let me start by looking at each example closely to see what's changing.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has several rows with 2 and 3 at the ends, and some numbers in between. The output seems to shift some numbers. Like in the second row of the input, the 3 is at the end, and in the output, there's a 4 inserted before the 3. Also, in the third row of the input, there's a 2 in the middle which in the output becomes a 0, and the 3s shift. Maybe there's a movement of certain numbers towards the edges?\n\nLooking at the other examples. Example 1's input has numbers like 7, 2, 3, 8. The output rows have these numbers moving towards the ends. For instance, in the third row of input, there's a 2 in the middle which becomes 2 at the start in the output. Similarly, a 7 in the input's second row moves to the end in the output. Maybe numbers are moving towards the nearest edge? Like, if a number is in the left half, it moves left; right half moves right?\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input row [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, ...], the output is [2, 2, 0, ...]. The 2 in position 3 (0-based index?) moves left to position 1. So maybe numbers are being shifted towards the nearest edge. Let's check the other rows.\n\nIn Example 2's input, a row like [4, 0, 2, 0, ...] becomes [4, 0, 0, ...], so the 2 disappears, but maybe it's merged with another number. Hmm, not sure. Wait, the output for that row is [4,0,0,...], so maybe the 2 moves left towards the 4? Or perhaps it's being replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number is moving in a specific direction based on their value. For example, 2s move left, 3s move right, 4s stay in the borders. Wait, in the first example, the output's borders are 0,4,4,...0 and 8,8,...0. The numbers 4 and 8 are on the borders. The internal numbers like 2 and 3 are at the edges. Wait, the input's first and last rows are borders with 4 and 8, and in the output, those remain, but the inner rows have 2 and 3 at the ends. But how do they move?\n\nWait, looking at the input rows in Example 0, the rows start with 2 and end with 3. In the output, sometimes those 3s are shifted. For example, in the third input row of Example 0: [2,0,0,2,0,...3] becomes [2,2,0,...3]. So the 2 in position 3 moves to position 1. So maybe numbers are moving left if they are on the left half of the row, or right if on the right half.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps each non-zero number (excluding the borders) is moving towards the nearest edge. So if a number is in the left half of the row (excluding the first and last elements), it moves left until it hits another number or the edge. Similarly for the right half. Let's test this.\n\nTake Example 0's input row [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]. The output is [2,0,...,0,0,3,3]. The 3s in positions 10 and 14 (assuming 0-based) in the input. In the output, the 3s are at positions 13 and 14. So the 3 in position 10 moves to 13, and the 3 at 14 stays. That suggests that numbers on the right side move right. Similarly, numbers on the left move left.\n\nAnother example: in Example 1's input, the third row is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,4]. The output is [2,2,0,...4]. So the 2 at position 7 moves left to position 1. But position 7 is in the right half (since the row has 12 elements, indices 0-11, so midpoint around 5.5). Wait, position 7 is in the right half. So if the rule is numbers move towards the nearest edge, maybe the 2 at position 7 would move right, but in the output, it's moving left. Hmm, that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the number's value. For example, 2s move left, 3s move right, 4s are part of the border. Let's check. In Example 0, the input has 2s at the start and 3s at the end. In the output, sometimes 2s are duplicated (like in row 3, the 2 moves left, becoming two 2s). Maybe when numbers move, they merge if they meet the same number. Or perhaps it's a shift, and when they hit another number, they stop.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero number (except the borders) moves towards the nearest edge (left or right). So for each element in the row (excluding the first and last, which are part of the borders), if it's a non-zero, it moves as far as possible towards the closest edge. For example, if a number is in the left half, it moves left until it hits another non-zero or the border. If in the right half, moves right.\n\nLet me test this. Take Example 0's input row: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3]. The output is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]. The 3 in position 10 (right half) moves right to position 13, and the 3 in position 14 stays. So the 3 in position 10 moves towards the right edge, stopping at position 13 because position 14 is already occupied (but in the output, it's 3,3). Wait, perhaps they stack at the edge.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all non-border numbers move towards the nearest edge, and if they reach the edge, they merge into the existing border. Wait, but the borders are 0 in the first and last elements in the input, but in the output they remain 0. Wait, no, in the training examples, the borders (first and last elements) are part of the outer rows (like the first row in Example 0 is [0,4,4,...,0], so those are borders. The inner rows have 2 and 3 at the ends. So maybe the inner rows' ends are also considered edges.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers in the inner rows (non-border rows) have their own edges. For example, each row (except the first and last) starts with 2 and ends with 3 (in Example 0). So maybe in the inner rows, numbers move towards the left edge (2) or right edge (3). So any number in the row between the first and last elements (which are 2 and 3) would move towards the nearest of these two.\n\nBut how to determine which edge is closer? For example, in a row of length 15 (indices 0-14), the first element is 2 (index 0), the last is 3 (index 14). The midpoint is around index 7. So any number to the left of the midpoint would move towards 2 (left edge), and any to the right would move towards 3 (right edge). Then, when they move, they shift as far as possible towards their respective edge, replacing 0s, but stopping when they hit another non-zero.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's third input row: [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]. The 2 is at index 3. The midpoint is 7, so index 3 is left of midpoint. So the 2 should move left towards index 0. The output for this row is [2,2,0,...3]. So the 2 at index 3 moves left to index 1 (since index 0 is already 2, so it stops at index 1). Then, the output has 2s at indices 0 and 1. That makes sense.\n\nAnother example: in Example 0's fifth input row: [2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. The 3 is at index 3 (left of midpoint), so it should move left. But 3's are supposed to be on the right edge. Wait, maybe the direction is determined by the number's value. Like 2s move left, 3s move right. Because 2 is at the left end, 3 at the right. So any number in the row that's a 2 would move left, 3 would move right. Wait, but in the input rows, there are other numbers like 7,8,4, etc. How do they behave?\n\nLooking at Example 0's input row: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]. The output is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. The 7 in the middle (index 7) is exactly at the midpoint. So maybe numbers other than 2 and 3 behave differently. Wait, in the output, the 7 is gone. Or perhaps it moves towards the right edge. But in the output row, the 7 is gone. Hmm, maybe only 2 and 3 move, and other numbers are removed? That doesn't seem right. Because in other examples, there are numbers like 8,4, etc., which are part of the borders.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are moving towards their respective edges based on their own value. For example, 2s move left (since they start at the left edge), 3s move right (since they end at the right edge). Other numbers (like 7,8,4) are part of the surrounding border rows. Wait, maybe the non-border numbers (like 7,8,4) in the inner rows are being moved towards their nearest border. For example, if a number is in a row that's between two borders (like 4 above and 8 below), then numbers in inner rows move towards either the top (4) or bottom (8) borders. But how would that apply?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers in the inner rows are moving towards the nearest edge (left or right), but numbers 2 and 3 are part of the row's own edges and other numbers (like 7,8) are part of the vertical borders. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me look at another example. In Example 1's input, there's a row [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]. The output is [2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4]. Wait, how does the 7 turn into a 1? That doesn't fit. Wait, the 7 in input is in position 8, which is in the right half. So maybe the 7 moves right towards the edge. But the output in that row has 0s there. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers other than the row's edges (2 and 3, or 2 and 4 in other examples) are moved to the respective borders. For example, in a row starting with 2 and ending with 4, any number in between moves towards the left or right edge based on their position. But this is getting a bit vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that all non-zero numbers (except the first and last in each row) are shifted towards the nearest edge (left or right), and when they reach the edge, they merge into the existing edge numbers. But how does that explain the changes?\n\nLet's take Example 0's third input row again: [2,0,0,2,0,...3]. The output has [2,2,0,...3]. The 2 at position 3 moves left, merging with the left edge's 2. So now there are two 2s at the start. Similarly, any number in the left half moves left, and in the right half moves right. So numbers are shifted towards the nearest edge, merging with existing numbers.\n\nIn Example 1's input row [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,4], the output is [2,2,0, ...4]. The 2 at position 7 is in the right half (row length 12, indices 0-11; position 7 is in the right half). Wait, but according to the midpoint (5.5), position 7 is in the right half. So according to the previous idea, this 2 should move right towards the edge (position 11), but in the output, it's at position 1. That contradicts. So maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the number's value. For example, 2s always move left, 3s move right. Other numbers? Maybe 7s move down, 8s up? But that complicates things. Let's check Example 0's row with 7: input row [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. The output row is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. The 7 disappears. So perhaps numbers other than 2 and 3 are removed? But in other examples, there's a 8 in the input that stays. Wait, looking at Example 0's input row 7: [2,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. Output is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,0,0,3]. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look again.\n\nWait, no. The output for Example 0's input row 7 is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,0,0,3]. Wait, the input row has 8 at index 5. The output row has 4 at index 9 and 2 at index 11. That's puzzling. How does an 8 turn into a 4 and 2? Maybe there's a vertical component here. Because the 8 is in a row that's between the 4 borders and the 8 borders. Perhaps numbers move vertically towards their respective borders. But this is getting more complex.\n\nAlternatively, the puzzle might involve both horizontal and vertical movements. For example, numbers move towards their nearest edge in both directions. But given that the examples show rows transforming into other rows, maybe it's per-row transformations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are \"falling\" towards the bottom or top. For example, in Example 0's input row with 8 in the middle, perhaps it moves down to the bottom border. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of horizontal and vertical shifts. But the training examples only show row-wise transformations, so perhaps focusing on row-wise changes is better.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern per row. For each row (excluding the top and bottom border rows), the first and last elements are preserved. The elements in between are transformed. Let's compare input and output rows for each example.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput row 1 (0-based? Let's assume the first row after the top border is row 1):\n\nInput: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nSo a 4 is added at position 9. Where does this 4 come from? The input row has no 4. Wait, maybe this 4 is coming from a row below? Like vertical movement. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are moving to the adjacent row towards their respective borders. For example, the 4 in the top border might influence the rows below. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number moves towards the nearest edge (left, right, top, bottom), but given that the outputs are rows, maybe per-row processing.\n\nAnother angle: look at the positions of the numbers in input and output. For example, in Example 0's third input row:\n\nInput: [2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput: [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nThe 2 at index 3 moves to index 1. So shifted left by two positions. But why? Maybe it's moving towards the left edge (index 0) but is blocked by the existing 2. So it moves as far left as possible, stopping at index 1.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's input row [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,4], the output is [2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4]. The 7 disappears, and a 1 appears. That's confusing. Wait, perhaps the 1 is coming from another row. Looking at Example 1's input, the top border is 1s. Maybe numbers move vertically towards the top or bottom borders. So 7s move down, 1s move up. But how does that explain the 1 appearing in the output row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves swapping numbers based on their position relative to the borders. For example, numbers in the upper half move up, lower half move down. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to find a different approach. Let's look for common elements in the input and output rows across all examples.\n\nOne observation: The first and last rows of each example are borders and remain unchanged. The inner rows start and end with certain numbers (like 2 and 3 in Example 0), and these numbers sometimes duplicate or shift. Also, in the outputs, the non-zero numbers in the inner rows are clustered towards the edges. For instance, in Example 0's output rows, there are more 2s and 3s towards the edges.\n\nAnother pattern: The numbers in the inner rows seem to be moving towards the edges. For example, in Example 0's input row [2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3], the output is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3]. The 3s have moved to the end. Similarly, the 2s in other rows move towards the start.\n\nPerhaps the rule is that all non-zero numbers in the inner rows (excluding the first and last elements) move towards the nearest edge (left or right) and stack there. For example, a number in the left half moves left until it hits another number or the edge. A number in the right half moves right until it hits another number or the edge. Then, the numbers accumulate at the edges.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's input row [2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. The two 2s are at positions 0 and 3. The midpoint is at position 7. The 2 at position 3 is in the left half, so it moves left. It can move to position 1 (since position 0 is occupied by 2). So the output becomes [2,2,0,...3]. That matches the example.\n\nIn Example 0's row [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,3], the 7 is at position 7 (midpoint). So it's exactly in the middle. But since the row is length 15 (indices 0-14), midpoint is 7. So 7 is in the right half. So it should move right. But in the output, it's replaced with 0. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe numbers not 2 or 3 are treated differently. Or perhaps they move vertically.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the numbers 2 and 3 move horizontally, and other numbers move vertically towards their respective borders. For example, 4s are in the top border, so any 4 in the inner rows moves up. 8s are in the bottom border, so they move down. 7s perhaps move down, etc.\n\nBut how does this explain Example 0's input row with 7? The 7 is in the middle of the row. If it moves down, it would appear in the next row. But looking at the output, in the next row (row 4), there's no 7. Instead, in row 7 of the output, there's a 4. Hmm, not sure.\n\nThis is getting quite complicated. Let's try to look for another pattern. Maybe each non-zero number moves in a specific direction based on their value. For example:\n\n- 2s move left\n- 3s move right\n- 4s move up\n- 8s move down\n- 7s move down\n- 1s move up\n- etc.\n\nBut how does this apply to the examples?\n\nIn Example 1's input, there's a row with a 7 which in the output disappears. Maybe the 7 moves down to the bottom border. Looking at the output's last row, which is all 7s. So maybe the 7 in the input moves down to the bottom. But how does that affect the row it was in?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves moving each non-border number to the corresponding border. For instance, if a number is present in the inner rows, it moves towards the nearest border of the same number and accumulates there. For example, a 4 would move up to the top border (which is 4s), a 8 would move down to the bottom border (which is 8s), 2s move left to the left edge of their row, 3s move right to the right edge, etc.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 7 in the middle of a row might move down to the bottom border (which is 8s), but that doesn't explain why it disappears. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number (except those in the borders) is removed and added to their respective border counts. But the borders in the examples don't change their counts. For example, in Example 0's output, the top and bottom borders are the same as the input. So this can't be.\n\nAnother approach: the output rows have the same first and last elements as the input rows, but the inner elements are shifted such that non-zero numbers are moved towards the nearest edge, leaving zeros in their previous positions.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's input row [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3], the output is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3]. The 3 at position 10 moves to position 13, and the 3 at position 14 stays. So they move right. The 2 stays at position 0.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's input row [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,4], the output is [2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4]. The 7 is gone, and a 1 appears at position 5. The 1 might have come from the top border (which has 1s) moving down. But how?\n\nThis is getting too vague. Let's try to codify what's happening in each example.\n\nIn Example 0's input rows, the inner rows have 2 at the start and 3 at the end. The output rows have more 2s and 3s clustered towards the edges, with other numbers like 4 and 8 appearing in the middle. Perhaps the numbers in between are moving towards their respective edges. For example, any number that's a 2 or 3 moves towards the start or end respectively. Other numbers (like 7,8) move towards their respective borders (top or bottom).\n\nBut how does this work vertically? For example, a 7 in the input moves down to the bottom border (which is 8s in Example 0's input). That doesn't align. Maybe numbers not part of the row edges (like 2 and 3) move vertically towards their respective borders.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire grid is such that numbers are \"falling\" towards their respective borders. For example, 4s fall up, 8s fall down, 2s fall left, 3s fall right, etc. But how does this apply to the training examples?\n\nThis is quite challenging. Let me try to see what's common in the outputs:\n\n- The first and last rows are unchanged.\n- In the inner rows, the first and last elements are preserved (e.g., 2 and 3 in Example 0).\n- Non-zero elements between them are shifted towards the edges, leaving zeros behind.\n- If multiple numbers are moving towards the same edge, they stack at the edge.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's input row [2,0,0,2,0,...3], the output is [2,2,0,...3]. The second 2 moves left and stops next to the existing 2.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 0's row [2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3], the output is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3]. The 3 at position 10 moves right to join the existing 3s.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: For each non-zero element in the row (excluding the first and last), move it towards the nearest edge (left if in the left half, right if in the right half). When moving, it shifts as far as possible towards that edge, replacing zeros but stopping if it hits another non-zero. The first and last elements remain unchanged.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample 0's input row: [2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. The two 2s are at 0 and 3. The midpoint is 7. The 2 at 3 is in the left half, so it moves left. It can move to index 1 (since index 0 is occupied by 2). So the output becomes [2,2,0,...3], which matches.\n\nAnother example: Example 0's input row [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. The 7 is at index 7 (midpoint), so it's in the right half. Thus, it moves right. But the output row has 0s in those positions, so the 7 moves right to the nearest non-zero. Wait, the output is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. So the 7 disappears. This contradicts. Unless numbers other than 2 and 3 are removed. Or perhaps only 2 and 3 are moved, and others are turned into zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps non-2 and non-3 numbers are erased. But in Example 0's input row with 8: [2,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3], the output is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,0,0,3]. The 8 is replaced by 4 and 2. This doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the numbers are being replaced by the border numbers if they are in the same column. For example, if a number is in a column where the top or bottom border is a certain value, it gets replaced by that value. For instance, in Example 0, the top border is 4s and the bottom is 8s. So any number in the inner rows may be replaced by 4 if they are in a column where the top is 4, or 8 if the bottom is 8.\n\nBut in Example 0's row with 8, the output has a 4 and a 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each column has a dominant number (from the top and bottom borders), and any number in that column is replaced by the dominant number. For example, in Example 0, columns 1-13 are 4s at the top and 8s at the bottom. So numbers in these columns may be replaced by 4 if they are closer to the top, or 8 if closer to the bottom.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nWait, in the output rows, sometimes new numbers appear. For example, in Example 0's output row 1: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3]. The 4 wasn't in the input. How did it get there? Maybe it's coming from the top border. The column where the 4 appears is column 9. The top border's column 9 is 4. So perhaps numbers from the top or bottom borders are being copied down or up into the inner rows if there's a path of zeros.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a number moves, it leaves a trail of the border's number. For example, when a number moves left, the space it vacates is filled with the top border's number if moving from the left half, or the bottom border's number if moving from the right half.\n\nIn Example 0's row 1 input: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. Output is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3]. The 4 appears at position 9. The top border has 4s, so column 9 is 4. So when a number moves, the vacated spot is filled with the top or bottom border's value depending on the direction.\n\nBut how does that apply? For example, in the input row where a 2 moves left from position 3 to 1, the vacated positions (3 and 2) would be filled with the top border's number (4). But in the output row, those positions are 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a different angle. The outputs for the training examples have the same structure as the inputs but with certain numbers shifted. For example, in Example 1's input, a row with 7 and 2 in the middle ends up with a 1 in the output. The 1 is part of the top border. Maybe numbers are being replaced by the border values of their column.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input row [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,4], the output is [2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4]. The 7 is replaced by 0s and a 1 appears at position 5. The top border in column 5 is 1. So perhaps when a number is moved, the space is filled with the top border's value if it's in the upper half of the grid, or the bottom border's value if in the lower half.\n\nBut Example 0's row 1 has a 4 appearing in the output, which is the top border's value for that column. So maybe when a number is moved, the vacated position is filled with the top or bottom border's number based on the row's position. For example, rows closer to the top get filled with top border numbers, closer to the bottom with bottom border numbers.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 1 (which is the second row, close to the top), the 4 appears in the output. The column's top border is 4. So perhaps when a number is moved from a position, that position is filled with the top border's number if the row is in the upper half of the grid, or the bottom border's number if in the lower half.\n\nBut how to determine upper and lower half? For Example 0's grid, which has 10 rows (0-9), the middle is around row 4.5. Rows 0-4 are upper half, 5-9 are lower. So row 1 is upper, so when a number is moved, the vacated spot is filled with the top border's value (4). In the output row 1, a 4 appears.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 0's row 7 (lower half), the input has an 8 which is part of the bottom border. In the output, there's a 4 and a 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, when a number is moved, the vacated positions are filled with the border number of the corresponding column. For example, column 9 in Example 0's row 1 is filled with 4, which matches the top border's column 9.\n\nThis seems plausible. Let's test this hypothesis:\n\nIn Example 0's input row 1 (row index 1):\n\nOriginal row: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nOutput row: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nThe 4 appears at index 9. The top border (row 0) for column 9 is 4. So when a number is moved from index 9, it's replaced with 4. But in the input, there was no number at index 9. So this doesn't explain it. Unless there's a number that moved into index 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a number moves, the path it takes (the zeros it moves through) are filled with the corresponding column's border value.\n\nBut I'm not sure. This is getting too time-consuming. Given the time I have, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each non-zero number in the inner rows moves towards the nearest edge (left or right based on their position relative to the row's midpoint), and after moving, the vacated positions are filled with the corresponding column's border value (top or bottom based on the row's position).\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nThe test input's first and last rows are borders. The inner rows start with 1 and end with 2. Let's process each inner row.\n\nFor each inner row (rows 1 to 12):\n\n- The first element is 1, and the last is 2. These remain unchanged.\n- For each non-zero element between them, determine if it's in the left or right half of the row and move it towards the nearest edge.\n- After moving, the vacated positions are filled with the top border (4) if the row is in the upper half, or bottom border (8) if in the lower half.\n\nLet's take row 2 of the test input:\n\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\nThe row length is 17 elements. Midpoint is at 8 (indices 0-16). So elements before index 8 are left half, after are right half.\n\nNon-zero elements: 8 at index 7 (left half), 1 at index 12 (right half).\n\n- The 8 at index 7 is in the left half, so move left as far as possible. The first element is 1, so 8 can't move past that. Wait, but the first element is 1, which is different. So perhaps the movement is towards the edge of the row (left or right), regardless of the row's edge values. So 8 at index 7 (left of midpoint) moves left. It would move left until it hits a non-zero. The first element is 1 (non-zero), so it stops at index 1. But the first element is 1, not 8. This complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the movement is towards the nearest edge of the entire grid (left or right), not per row. But the rows have varying first and last elements.\n\nThis is getting too ambiguous. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial pattern where non-zero elements in the inner rows move towards the nearest edge (left or right based on their position), and after moving, the vacated spots are filled with the top or bottom border's value based on the row's position.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input's borders are 4 (top) and 8 (bottom). The inner rows start with 1 and end with 2. But according to the training examples, the row's own edges (like 2 and 3) are preserved. So perhaps the movement is towards the row's own edges (1 and 2). But 1 and 2 are not in the same positions as the training examples. This complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the movement is based on the entire grid's left and right edges, ignoring the row's own first and last elements. But that's unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll proceed with the following steps for each row in the test input:\n\n1. Keep the first and last elements unchanged.\n2. For each non-zero element between them:\n   a. If in the left half of the row (excluding first and last), move it left as far as possible.\n   b. If in the right half, move it right as far as possible.\n3. Fill the vacated positions with 0 (or maybe the corresponding border's value).\n\nBut according to the training examples, sometimes new numbers appear (like 4 in Example 0's row 1), so it's more likely that vacated positions are filled with the top or bottom border's value based on the row's position.\n\nAssuming that:\n\n- For rows closer to the top (upper half), vacated positions are filled with the top border's value (4).\n- For rows closer to the bottom (lower half), vacated positions are filled with the bottom border's value (8).\n\nThe test input has 14 rows (0-13). The midpoint is around row 6.5. So rows 0-6 are upper half, rows 7-13 are lower half.\n\nLet's process row 2 of the test input:\n\nInput: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2]\n\nLength 17. Midpoint at index 8. Elements before 8 are left half, after are right.\n\nNon-zero elements: 8 at index 7 (left half), 1 at index 12 (right half).\n\n- 8 moves left. Possible positions: leftmost possible spot after the first element (index 0 is 1). So 8 can't move past 1. It moves as far left as possible, which would be index 1. The existing elements from 1 onwards are 0s. So 8 moves to index 1.\n\n- 1 at index 12 (right half) moves right. It can move to index 15 (since index 16 is 2). So it moves to index 15.\n\nAfter moving, the row becomes [1,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2].\n\nThen, vacated positions (indices 7, 12, etc.) are filled with 4 if upper half or 8 if lower half. Row 2 is upper half, so filled with 4.\n\nWait, but row 2 is index 2, which is upper half. So the vacated positions (originally 8 at 7, 1 at 12) are filled with 4.\n\nBut this would result in the row: [1,8,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,2].\n\nThis doesn't match the training examples' pattern. Perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the assumption that non-zero numbers in the inner rows move towards the nearest edge (left/right) and are replaced by 0s, with their new positions stacked at the edges. The first and last elements remain.\n\nApplying this to the test input's rows:\n\nFor example, row 2 of test input:\n\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\nNon-zero elements: 8 (index 7), 1 (index 12).\n\n- 8 is in the left half (index 7 < 8), moves left. The left edge is index 0. So it moves to the leftmost possible spot, which is index 1 (since index 0 is 1). So the row becomes [1,8,0,..., 1,0,...,2].\n\n- 1 at index 12 (right half) moves right. The right edge is index 16 (2). So it moves to index 15. Thus, the row becomes [1,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2].\n\nOther rows are processed similarly. The first and last elements are preserved, and non-zero numbers are moved towards the nearest edge.\n\nNow, applying this to all rows of the test input, the output would have the same first and last rows, and inner rows with numbers moved towards the edges.\n\nBut this is a simplified approach. Given the time, I'll proceed to write the transformed rows based on this pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see what's changing between the input and output. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn the input of Example 0, the first and last rows are [0,4,4,...,0] and [0,8,8,...,0], which remain the same in the output. So maybe the top and bottom rows with all the same numbers except the edges are kept as is. Then the middle rows have some transformations.\n\nLooking at the second row of input Example 0: [2,0,0,...,3]. In the output, the 10th element (index 9) becomes 4. Also, in the third input row, there's a 3 at position 10 which in the output moves to position 13. Hmm. Maybe numbers are being shifted to the right?\n\nWait, let's check. For instance, in Example 0's third input row: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]. The output is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3]. The 3 at position 10 (0-based index 10) moved to position 13 (index 13). So that's three positions to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number (except the first and last elements in each row) is shifted to the right by a certain number of positions, wrapping around? Or perhaps each non-zero number is shifted right, and the zeros take their place.\n\nWait, in Example 0's fourth input row: [2,0,0,2,0,...]. The output becomes [2,2,0,0,...]. So the 2 at index 3 in the input moves to index 1 in the output. That's a left shift. Hmm, conflicting with the previous thought.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the digits being moved towards the edges. Let's look for another pattern. In Example 1's input, the third row is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,4]. In the output, this becomes [2,2,0,...], which suggests that the 2 at index 7 moves to index 1. That's a left shift again. So maybe non-zero elements are being moved towards the start or end based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero number (except the first and last in the row) is moved to the next position towards the edge. For example, if a number is in position i, it moves to i-1 if it's on the left half, or i+1 if on the right half. But I need to check.\n\nTake Example 0's input row 3: [2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. Output is [2,2,0,0,...]. The 2 at position 3 (index 3) moves to index 1. So that's left by two positions. Wait, maybe each non-zero is moved to the nearest edge, either left or right. Like, the number moves as far as possible towards the edge until it hits another non-zero or the edge. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are shifted one position to the left or right, but only if the target position is zero. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 3: the 2 is at index 3. The output has it at index 1. So perhaps it's moving left past zeros. From index 3 to 1, there were zeros in between. So the 2 moved two positions left. Similarly, in Example 1's input row 3, the 2 at index 7 moves to index 1. That's a big jump. Wait, that's not possible with a single shift. Hmm, maybe that's a different pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, perhaps the transformation is that each non-zero number (excluding the first and last elements of the row) is moved one cell towards the nearest edge (left or right) based on their original position. For example, numbers in the left half move left, and those in the right half move right. Or perhaps the numbers are moved towards the closest edge. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 3, the 2 is at index 3. The row length is 15, so the middle is at index 7. Since index 3 is to the left of the middle, moving left towards the left edge. But that 2 is at index 3. Moving left would require positions 0 and 1 (since the first element is 2 already). Wait, the first element is 2. So maybe the numbers are being moved towards the edges, but if they can't move further (because there's a non-zero), they stop. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero element (except the first and last) is shifted in the direction of the nearest edge by one. For example, if a number is closer to the left edge, it shifts left; if closer to the right, it shifts right. Let's see.\n\nTake Example 0's input row 3: the first element is 2, last is 3. The 2 at index 3 is 3 positions from the left (index 0) and 11 positions from the right (index 14). So it's closer to the left. So it should shift left. But in the output, it's moved to index 1. That would be two shifts left. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all non-zero elements (except first and last) are shifted towards the center. Or maybe shifted to the opposite side. This isn't clear.\n\nLooking at another example. In Example 2's input row 2: [4,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]. The output becomes [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]. So the 2 at index 2 is gone. Wait, no. Wait the output is [4,0,0,0,...]. So the 2 was at index 2 in input, but in output, it's missing. Or perhaps moved. But where? Maybe shifted left. If the first element is 4 (fixed), the 2 was at index 2. Moving left, the next position is index 1. But in the output row, index 1 is 0. So maybe the 2 is moved left and replaced by 0, but where does the 2 go? Maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero number (except first and last) is moved as far as possible towards the left or right edge, but in the output, numbers are arranged such that their positions are adjusted towards their respective edges, possibly swapping with zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are sorted such that all non-zero numbers are pushed to the left or right, but that doesn't fit with the examples. For example, in Example 0's row 7 input: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,0,0,3]. Output: [2,2,0,...]. So the 4 and 2 in input positions 9 and 11 become 2 and 0 in output positions 1 and so on. That's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the first and last elements of each row are fixed, and the rest are transformed by moving each non-zero element one step towards the nearest edge, replacing the zero in that direction. If there's a zero, they move; if not, they stay. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 3: [2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. The 2 at index 3 (third position) is in the left half (since row length 15, index 0-14). Middle is index 7. So index 3 is left half. So it moves left. The next position to the left is index 2 (zero), so moves to index 2. Then again, since it's in the left half, moves left again to index 1. But in output, the 2 is at index 1. So maybe two steps left. How does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero element is moved as far left as possible (for left half) or as far right as possible (for right half). So the 2 in index 3 (left half) would move to the first available position towards the left edge, but not past the first element (which is 2). So in row 3's input, the 2 at index 3 could move to index 1 (since index 2 and 1 are zeros). Then the output has 2 at index 1. So that's possible. Similarly, any non-zero elements in the left half would shift left as far as possible, and those in the right half shift right as far as possible, but the first and last elements are fixed.\n\nSo the rule could be: For each row, the first and last elements remain the same. For the other elements, split the row into left and right halves (excluding first and last). Any non-zero in the left half moves as far left as possible, stopping at the first non-zero to their left. Similarly, non-zeros in the right half move as far right as possible, stopping at the first non-zero to their right.\n\nWait, let's check this with Example 0's row 3 input:\n\nOriginal row (indices 0-14):\n\n[2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\nLeft half is indices 1-7 (since total elements 15, excluding first and last (0 and 14), middle is at 7.5, so left half 1-7, right 8-13). The 2 is at index 3 (left half). So it should move left as far as possible. The first position available is index 1 (since index 0 is fixed as 2). So moving from 3 to 1. Thus, the output row becomes [2,2,0,0,...]. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 0's row 7 input: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3]. The non-zeros are 4 at index 9 (right half, since 9 is in 8-13), and 2 at index 11 (right half). So 4 should move right as far as possible. The right edge is index 13 (since 14 is fixed as 3). So 4 at 9 would move to 13? Wait, but output row 7 is [2,2,0,...]. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the split.\n\nWait the left half after excluding first and last (positions 0 and 14) would be positions 1-7 (left half) and 8-13 (right half). So:\n\nIn row 7 input, the 4 is at index 9 (right half) so it should move right. The rightmost possible position before the last element (14) is 13. So moving from 9 to 13. But in the output row 7, the 4 is gone. Instead, there's a 2 at index 1. Wait, perhaps the 2 in the input's index 11 (right half) would move to 13. Let's see. In the input, index 11 is 2 (right half). So it should move right to 13. But the output row 7 is [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. So the 2 from index 11 in input would have moved to 13 in output. But the output has 3 at 13 and 14. Wait, maybe the movement is only allowed into zero positions. Let me check the output row 7 of example 0: the output is [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. So the 2 from index 3 (input) moved to index 1 (output). The 4 and 2 in the right half (indices 9 and 11) in input are missing. Maybe they were moved to the right but the output shows zeros. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero elements (except first and last) are moved towards their respective edges, but in the output, they are placed adjacent to the edge (the first or last element) as much as possible. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 3: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,4]. The output becomes [2,2,0,...]. The 2 at index 7 (right half?) is moved to index 1. Wait, perhaps the split is different. If the middle is after the first and last elements, then the left half is positions 1 to (n-2)/2 and right the rest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each row, after the first and last elements, all the non-zero elements are gathered towards the edges. For example, in the left half (excluding first and last), non-zero numbers are moved to the left, and in the right half, to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero number (except first and last) is moved one step towards the nearest edge. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input row 3: 2 at index 3. The nearest edge is left (distance 3 from left, 11 from right). So move left by one to index 2. Then again, in the output, it's at index 1. So maybe multiple steps? But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero element (except first and last) is moved all the way to the nearest edge, pushing through zeros. So in row 3's input, the 2 at index 3 moves left until it hits a non-zero. Since the first element is 2, which is non-zero, so it can't move past that. So the 2 moves left as far as possible. Between index 3 and 0 (first element is 2), the zeros are at 1 and 2. So it moves to index 1. Thus, the output has 2 at index 1.\n\nAnother example: Example 0's row 7 input: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,0,0,3]. The non-zero elements are 4 at index 9 and 2 at index 11. For 4 at index 9: the nearest edge is right (distance 4 from right edge, 9 from left). So move right as far as possible. The right edge is at index 14 (fixed as 3). So moving from 9 to 13 (since 14 is 3). So 4 would be placed at 13. But in the output row 7, there's a 3 at 13 and 14. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are moved towards the first or last element of the same value. For example, in Example 0's row 3, the first element is 2, so any 2s in the row move towards the left edge. Similarly, the last element is 3, so any 3s move towards the right edge. Let's check.\n\nIn input row 3 of example 0: [2,0,0,2,0,...3]. The 2 at index 3 would move towards the left edge (since first element is 2). So moving left. The first available spot next to the left edge is index 1 (since index 0 is 2). So in the output, 2 is at index 1, making the row start with [2,2,...].\n\nSimilarly, in the same row's input, the last element is 3. The 3 at index 14 is fixed. Are there other 3s? In the input row, there's a 3 at index 14 (fixed) and another at index 10 (input row 2). In the output row 2, that 3 moves to index 13. So maybe 3s move towards the right edge (last element is 3). So the 3 at index 10 in the input moves to the right as far as possible. The next 3 is at index 14, so the 3 at 10 would move to index 13, next to 14. Which is what's in the output.\n\nThis seems plausible. Let's see other examples.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 3: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,4]. The first element is 2, last is 4. So any 2s should move towards the left edge. The 2 at index 7 would move left towards the first 2. The path is index 7 to 6, 5,... up to index 1. But in the output, the row becomes [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]. So the 2 at index 7 moved to index 1, next to the first 2. Similarly, the last element is 4. Any other 4s in the row? In Example 1's input row 0, the last element is 4. For example, input row 1: [2,0,...4]. The output row 1 has [2,0,...4], but with a 4 at position 9 (assuming 0-based). So maybe 4s move towards the last element (4). So if there's a 4 in the row, it moves to the right.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the pattern is: For each row, the first and last elements are fixed. All other elements that are non-zero are moved towards the edge where the same value is present (the first or last element). For example, if a number is the same as the first element, it moves left towards the first element. If it's the same as the last element, it moves right towards the last element. Otherwise, perhaps they are moved towards the nearest edge (left or right). Or maybe only numbers matching the first or last element move towards them.\n\nWait, in Example 0's row 7 input: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,0,0,3]. The first element is 2, last is 3. The non-zeros are 4, 2. The 2s would move towards the first 2 (left), and the 4 would move towards... but 4 isn't the first or last element. So what happens to it? In the output, the 4 is gone. So perhaps numbers that don't match the first or last element are removed or turned to zero. But in the output, the 4 in the input's row 7 becomes zero. Similarly, in Example 0's row 5 input: [2,0,0,3,0,...3], the 3 is moved towards the right edge (since last element is 3), so 3 moves to the end. But what about numbers that don't match first or last?\n\nWait, in Example 0's row 4 input: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. The output row 4 is [2,0,...0,3]. The 7 is gone. So perhaps any numbers that aren't equal to the first or last element of the row are set to zero. But then in Example 0's row 7 input, the 4 and 2 (other than first and last) would be turned to zero, but in the output, there's a 2 in row 7's output. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only numbers that match the first or last element are kept, others are removed. But in Example 0's row 3 input, there's a 2 (matches first element) and a 3 (matches last element). So they stay, and others are zeroed. But in Example 0's row 4 input, the 7 doesn't match first or last (2 and 3), so it's zeroed. Similarly, in Example 0's row 5 input, the 3 is kept as it matches the last element. But in the output of row 7, there's a 2 in the output. The 2 matches the first element (2), so it's kept and moved towards the left. The other 2 in row 7's input (at index 11) also matches the first element, so it moves towards the left. But how do they end up in the output as two 2s in the beginning?\n\nWait, in the input row 7, the two 2s (first element and index 11) would both move towards the left. The first 2 is at index 0 (fixed). The 2 at index 11 (right half) would need to move left. But since the first element is already 2, perhaps they stack up next to it. So in output row 7, the 2s from the input (index 0 and 11) become [2, 2, 0, ...]. So the 2 at index 11 moves left all the way to index 1, next to the first 2.\n\nIf this is the case, then the rule is:\n\nFor each row:\n\n- The first and last elements are fixed.\n- All other non-zero elements are checked. If they match the first element, they move as far left as possible towards the first element, accumulating adjacent to it. If they match the last element, they move as far right as possible towards the last element. Non-matching elements are set to zero.\n\nSo for example, any element that is the same as the first element in the row (other than the first itself) will shift left to be adjacent to the first element. Similarly, any element the same as the last will shift right to be adjacent to the last. All other elements become zero.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example 0:\n\nInput row 3: [2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. First element is 2, last is 3. The 2 at index 3 matches the first element, so it moves left to index 1. The 3 at index 14 is fixed. The output row is [2,2,0,0,...3]. That fits.\n\nInput row 5: [2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. The 3 at index 3 matches the last element (3), so it moves right to index 13. The output row is [2,0,0,0,...3,3]. That matches.\n\nExample 0's input row 7: [2,0,...,4,0,2,0,0,3]. The 4 and 2: 2 matches the first element, 4 doesn't. So the 2 at index 11 moves left to index 1 (as far as possible), the 4 becomes zero. So output row becomes [2,2,0,...3].\n\nExample 1's input row 3: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,4]. The 2s (first element) at index 7 move left to index 1, making [2,2,...4]. The 4 at the end is fixed.\n\nExample 2's input row 2: [4,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]. First is 4, last is 8. The 2 doesn't match either, so it becomes zero. The output row is [4,0,0,...8].\n\nThis seems to fit all the examples. So the pattern is:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n1. The first and last elements remain unchanged.\n2. For all other positions in the row:\n   a. If the element is the same as the first element of the row, move it as far left as possible (adjacent to the first element).\n   b. If the element is the same as the last element of the row, move it as far right as possible (adjacent to the last element).\n   c. Otherwise, set the element to zero.\n\nThus, in the output, each row's non-zero elements (other than first and last) are either the same as the first or last element, moved towards their respective edges.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nThe rows are:\n\n[0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0] \u2192 first and last are 0 and 0. So any elements in between that are 0 should move to left or right edges. But wait, first and last are 0, so any 0 in between would be moved? Wait, but according to the rule, only elements matching the first (0) or last (0) would be moved. But first and last are same here. So any 0s in the row (other than first and last) would be moved towards the left or right edge (since both edges are 0). But how? Probably, they are moved towards their nearest edge.\n\nWait, the first row of the test input is [0,4,4,...,4,0]. Since first and last are 0, which are same. So any 0 in between (but in this row, there are none except first and last) would be moved towards their nearest edge. But in the first row of test input, all middle elements are 4, so they don't match first/last (0), so they would be set to zero. Wait, but according to the rule, elements not matching first or last are set to zero. But in the first row, the first and last are 0. So all the 4s in between should be set to zero. But that's not the case in the training examples. For example, in Example 0's first input row, which is [0,4,4,...,0], the output is the same. So this suggests that when the first and last elements are the same, perhaps all elements except the first and last are set to that value. But in training example 0, the first row is [0,4,4,...,0] and the output is the same. Which contradicts the previous pattern. So maybe the rule is different when the first and last elements are the same.\n\nWait, in all the training examples, the first and last elements of the top and bottom rows are the same (e.g., 0 and 0 in Example 0's first row, 0 and 0 in Example 1's first row, etc.), and those rows are unchanged in the output. So perhaps if the first and last elements are the same, the entire row remains unchanged. Otherwise, apply the previous rule.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each row:\n\n- If the first and last elements are the same, the row remains unchanged.\n- Else:\n   a. First and last elements are fixed.\n   b. Any non-zero element matching the first element moves as far left as possible.\n   c. Any non-zero element matching the last element moves as far right as possible.\n   d. All other elements are set to zero.\n\nThis explains why the first and last rows in the training examples (with first and last elements the same) are unchanged. So in the test input's first row, since first and last are 0, it remains unchanged. Similarly for the last row of the test input, which is [0,8,8,...,0], so it remains the same.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input rows:\n\nLet's process each row:\n\nRow 0: [0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0]. First and last are 0, same. So output is same.\n\nRow 1: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. First is 1, last is 2. They are different. So:\n\n- Keep first (1) and last (2).\n- For other elements, check if they match first (1) or last (2). All are 0, so no action. So output is same as input. But in the output examples, sometimes zeros are introduced. Wait, no. Because according to the rule, elements not matching first or last are set to zero. But all elements are already zero, except first and last. So row 1's output is same as input.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's row 1 input: [2,0,...,3]. The output has some 4 introduced. Wait, that's because in Example 0's row 1, the last element is 3, but there's a 4 in the output. Wait, that contradicts. Let me check.\n\nWait, in Example 0's row 1 input: [2,0,0,...,3]. Output row is [2,0,0,...,0,0,3]. Wait, no. In Example 0's output row 1, there's a 4 at index 9. How does that fit?\n\nAh, perhaps my previous assumption is incorrect. Let's re-examine Example 0's row 1:\n\nInput row 1: [2,0,0,...,3]. Output row 1: [2,0,0,...,4,0,...,3]. Wait, in the output, index 9 is 4, which wasn't in the input. That contradicts the previous pattern. So my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Let's re-examine Example 0:\n\nInput row 1: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. Output row 1: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3]. So a 4 appears at index 9. Where did that come from? The input row 1 has no 4s. The only non-zeros are 2 and 3. But the output has a 4. This suggests that the pattern isn't based on the row's first and last elements. So my earlier hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nThis means I need to look for a different pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the transformation involves shifting numbers from other rows. For example, numbers may fall down from higher rows. Or some other grid-based movement.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput row 1 has 2 and 3 as first and last. The output row 1 has 4 at index 9. Where could this 4 come from? Looking at other rows in the input, row 0 has 4s. Maybe numbers are falling down. For example, in the input, row 0 has 4s except for the first and last 0. In the output, row 1 has a 4 at index 9. So maybe a 4 from row 0 falls down to row 1. But why to index 9?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero number in a row is replaced by the number from the row above. For example, if a cell in row i has a non-zero number, it's replaced by the number from row i-1, same column. But in Example 0's input row 1, all elements except first and last are zero. The output row 1's 4 is at index 9, which in row 0 (input) is 4. So perhaps the 4 from row 0's index 9 falls down to row 1's index 9.\n\nBut how about other examples. Example 0's input row 2 has a 3 at index 10. In the output, row 2's 3 moves to index 13. But row 1's index 13 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-zero number in a column shifts down as far as possible, similar to the game \"2048\". So for each column, numbers fall down, stacking on top of each other. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nLooking at column 1:\n\nRow 0: 4\n\nRow 1:0\n\nRow 2:0\n\n...\n\nRow 9:8\n\nIn the output, column 1:\n\nRow 0:4\n\nRow 1:0\n\nRow 2:0\n\n...\n\nRow 9:8\n\nNo change. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe numbers are being moved from their current position to a new position based on some direction, perhaps influenced by their value. For example, if a number is 2, it shifts left, 3 shifts right, etc. But the numbers vary in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each number (except first and last in each row) is replaced by the number that was in the cell to the left in the input. But that doesn't explain the 4 in Example 0's output row 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being replaced based on their position. For example, the 4 in Example 0's output row 1 at index 9 could be due to the input row 8's index 9, which is 4. But row 8's input is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. So index 9 is 0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is a combination of vertical and horizontal shifts, but this is getting too complicated.\n\nAnother approach: look for changes between input and output in each example to find common operations.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 7: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,0,0,3]. Output row 7: [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. So the 4 and 2 in the input are gone. The 2 from index 11 is moved to index 1. So it's as if the 2s are collected to the left.\n\nExample 0's input row 2: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3]. Output row 2: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3]. So the 3s move to the right.\n\nExample 1's input row 6: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4]. Output row 6: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4]. The 4 moves to the right.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that non-zero elements are moved towards their respective edges (left if they are same as first element, right if same as last), and others are zeroed.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 1 input and output, there's a 4 introduced. How does that fit?\n\nIn Example 0's input row 1: [2,0,...,3]. Output row 1: [2,0,...,4,0,...,3]. The 4 appears in column 9. Where does this 4 come from?\n\nLooking at the input, perhaps the 4 is coming from the row above. Input row 0's column 9 is 4. So maybe the 4 falls down from row 0 to row 1, column 9. But why only in that column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero element in the row above is copied down if the current cell is zero. For example, in Example 0's row 1, column 9 is zero in input. The row above (row 0) has 4 in column 9. So in the output, this 4 is copied down to row 1, column 9.\n\nBut why in Example 0's row 1, only column 9 is copied, and others are zero? Let's check other columns. For example, row 1's column 1: input is 0, row 0's column 1 is 4. But output is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps elements are copied down only if the current cell is zero and the row above's cell is non-zero. But then, why only some cells are copied?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are moving down from their current position. For example, in Example 0's input row 7 has a 4 in column 9. In the output, this 4 is moved down to row 8, column 9. But the output's row 8 is [2,0,0,...,3], so no 4 there. This is unclear.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps each non-zero element in the input is shifted down by one row, and to the right by one column. But this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by moving each non-zero element (except first and last of each row) one step to the right. But Example 0's row 3 input has a 2 at index 3 moving to index 1 in output. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nIn Example 0's input and output:\n\nRow 7 input has 4 and 2 in the middle. Output row 7 has 2 at index 1. So perhaps 2 is duplicated, but why?\n\nLooking at other rows, maybe the numbers are being moved to their respective edges and summed. For example, in Example 0's row 3 input: two 2s. Output has two 2s at the start. But summing isn't evident.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are moved towards the edges and any that reach the edge are combined. For example, the 2 in row 3's input moves left to join the existing 2.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the first and last elements act as \"magnets\" attracting their own numbers. So any number matching the first element is moved left adjacent to it, and any matching the last element are moved right adjacent to it.\n\nIn Example 0's row 1 input: [2,0,...,3]. The output has a 4 at position 9. But 4 isn't the first or last element. So this complicates things.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers in the output are the sum of the numbers in the input's column. For example, in Example 0's row 1, column 9 is 4. Let's check the input column 9 across all rows.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nColumn 9 for each row:\n\nRow 0:4\n\nRow 1:0\n\nRow 2:0\n\nRow 3:0\n\nRow 4:0\n\nRow 5:0\n\nRow 6:0\n\nRow 7:4 (input row 7, column 9 is 4)\n\nRow 8:0\n\nRow 9:8\n\nSo the column 9 in output row 1 is 4, which might be from row 7's column 9. But how?\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Let's think differently. Maybe the transformation involves rotating or reflecting the grid.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output, the output has fewer rows. Input has 10 rows, output has 9. Wait, no:\n\nExample 0's input is 10 rows, output is also 10 rows. I think I miscounted. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input:\n\n10 rows (0 to 9). Output also 10 rows. So no row removal. But how? Maybe rows are being transformed individually.\n\nAnother approach: for each row in the input, the output row is formed by taking the first and last elements, then between them, all elements that are the same as either the first or last are gathered towards their respective edges, and others are zeros. The order in which they are gathered depends on their original positions.\n\nFor example, in a row where first is 2 and last is 3, all 2s in the row (except first) are moved to the left side (as far left as possible), and all 3s (except last) are moved to the right side. All other numbers become zero.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 1 input: [2,0,...,3], output is [2,0,...,4,0,...,3]. This doesn't fit, as 4 is introduced. So this approach also fails.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input row 1, the output has a 4. Where could that come from? The only 4 in the input's nearby rows is in row 0. Maybe it's a vertical shift. Like, numbers fall down from the row above into the current row if the current cell is zero.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 1, column 9 is 0. Row 0's column 9 is 4. So in output, row 1's column 9 becomes 4. Similarly, other columns in row 1 have 0 because the above row's column is 4, but they're not copied. But in row 1's output, only column 9 has a 4, which matches row 0's column 9. Other columns in row 1 are zero. Why only column 9?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a number falls down from the row above if the current cell is zero and the cell below is non-zero. Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, in Example 0's row 1 output, the 4 could be from row 0's column 9, but why does it appear in row 1's column 9? Maybe each column is processed so that any number in a cell flows down as far as possible, with lower rows' existing numbers blocking. For example, in column 9 of Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0:4\n\nRow 1:0\n\nRow 2:0\n\nRow 3:0\n\nRow 4:0\n\nRow 5:0\n\nRow 6:0\n\nRow 7:4\n\nRow 8:0\n\nRow 9:8\n\nIn the output's column 9:\n\nRow 0:4 (unchanged)\n\nRow 1:4 (from row 0)\n\nRow 7:0 (because row 7's input is 4, which falls down to row 8?\n\nWait, but output row 7 is [2,2,0,...,0,3]. So column 9 in row 7's output is 0. Input's column 9 in row 7 is 4. So maybe the 4 falls down to row 8, but row 8's input is 0. So in output row 8's column 9 would be 4. But in Example 0's output row 8 is [2,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. Column 9 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's think of another angle.\n\nLooking at the numbers in the input and output:\n\nIn Example 0's row 1, output has a 4 where input didn't. This suggests that the transformation involves numbers from other rows or columns. But it's unclear how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the output are the sum of adjacent cells in the input. For example, the 4 in Example 0's output row 1, column 9 could be the sum of adjacent cells. But the input row 1, column 9 is 0. The surrounding cells (row 0 column 9 is 4, row 1 column 8 and 10 are 0). Sum is 4, but how?\n\nAlternatively, it's a convolution or filter applied. This seems too complex for a puzzle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking each row from the input and for each non-zero element (except first and last), replace it with the value of the row above's corresponding position. So in Example 0's row 1, column 9 is 0, but row 0's column 9 is 4, so it becomes 4. Similarly, in row 2's output, if the input's row 2 has a 3 at column 10, the output's row 2 has a 0 at column 10, but the row above (output row 1) has a 4 at column 9. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, it's a cellular automaton-like rule where each cell looks to the row above and/or below.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Let's look for any other patterns.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the output row 1 has a 4 introduced. The only 4s in the input are in row 0 and row 7. The output's row 1's 4 is in column 9. Input's row 0, column 9 is 4. Input's row 7, column 9 is 4. Maybe it's a combination.\n\nAlternatively, the output's row 1, column 9's 4 could be from input's row 7, column 9. But how?\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe each number is moved down by a certain number of rows equal to their value. For example, a 4 moves down 4 rows. But in Example 0's row 0, column 9 is 4. Moving down 4 rows would land in row 4, column 9. But output row 4's column 9 is 0.\n\nAlternatively, numbers are moved down by one row and their value is added to the cell below. So in Example 0's row 0, column 9's 4 moves down to row 1, column 9. Which fits the output. But then why don't other 4s in row 0 affect other rows? For example, row 0, column 1 is 4. Moving down to row 1, column 1 would introduce a 4, but output row 1, column 1 is 0. So this is inconsistent.\n\nBut in Example 0's output row 1, column 9 is 4. Input row 0's column 9 is 4, and input row 1's column 9 is 0. So if the 4 from row 0 falls into row 1's column 9, this explains the output. But why only that column?\n\nPerhaps the rule is that for each cell in the input, if the cell is non-zero and the cell directly below it is zero, then the non-zero value moves down. This would simulate gravity pulling numbers down. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 0, column 9 is 4. The cell below (row 1, column 9) is 0. So 4 moves down to row 1, column 9. Other cells in row 0 are 4, but their cells below (row 1) are 0. So why don't they move down? For example, row 0, column 1 is 4. Row 1, column 1 is 0. So 4 should move down, making output row 1, column 1 4. But in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only certain numbers are affected. For example, in Example 0's input, row 7 has a 4 at column 9. The cell below (row 8, column 9) is 0. So 4 moves down to row 8, column 9. But output row 8's column 9 is 0. So this isn't happening.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the test input, perhaps applying the pattern as follows:\n\nFirst and last rows remain the same. For other rows:\n\n- The first and last elements are kept.\n\n- For each row, non-zero elements that match the first or last element of their row are moved towards the respective edge, and others are removed.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 1 input: [2,0,...,3], there's a 4 in the output. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: The output is formed by merging adjacent rows in the input. For example, output rows are the sum of adjacent input rows. But Example 0's output has the same number of rows as the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the result of some sort of rotation or shift applied to the entire grid.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by shifting each row to the left or right, with the first and last elements fixed. But Example 0's row 3's input has a 2 that moves left, suggesting a left shift for certain elements.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's try to see what the test input's output should be based on the pattern from the examples.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\nFirst row: [0,4,4,...,0]. First and last are 0, same. So output is same.\n\nLast row: [0,8,8,...,0]. First and last are 0, so output is same.\n\nOther rows:\n\nRow 1: [1,0,...,2]. First is 1, last is 2. So all non-zero elements matching 1 move left, those matching 2 move right. But there are no other 1s or 2s except the first and last. So output is same as input.\n\nRow 2: [1,0,...,0,8,...,2]. Input has an 8 at column 7. But 8 doesn't match 1 or 2. So in output, 8 is zeroed. But also, there's a 1 at column 12. 1 matches first element, so it moves left. Let's see.\n\nRow 2 input: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2]. So first is 1, last is 2. Non-zero elements in between: 8 (column 7), 1 (column 12). \n\nThe 1 at column 12 matches the first element (1), so it should move left as far as possible. The leftmost available spot after the first element (column 0) is column 1. So output row 2 would have 1 at column 1. The 8 is zeroed.\n\nSo output row 2: [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2].\n\nRow 3 input: [1,0,0,2,0,...,3,0,2]. First is 1, last is 2. Non-zeros in between: 2 (column 3), 3 (column 14). \n\nThe 2 matches the last element (2), so it should move right. The rightmost available position before the last element is column 15 (since last is 2 at column 16). So it moves to column 15. The 3 doesn't match first or last, so it's zeroed.\n\nOutput row 3: [1,0,0,0,0,...,0,2,2].\n\nRow 4 input: all zeros except first and last. So output is same.\n\nRow 5 input: [1,0,...,1,0,7,0,...,8,0,2]. First is 1, last is 2. Non-zeros: 1 (column 5), 7 (column 10), 8 (column 13). \n\nThe 1 at column 5 matches first element (1), moves to column 1. 7 and 8 are zeroed. \n\nOutput row 5: [1,1,0,...,0,0,0,...,2].\n\nRow 6: same as row 4.\n\nRow 7 input: [1,0,0,0,2,...,0,2]. Non-zero: 2 at column 4. It matches last element (2), so moves right to column 15.\n\nOutput row 7: [1,0,0,0,0,...,0,2,2].\n\nRow 8: same as row 4.\n\nRow 9 input: [1,0,0,0,6,0,4,0,...,4,0,2]. Non-zeros:6 (col5), 4 (col8 and 14). 6 doesn't match first/last (1/2), so zeroed. 4s don't match, so zeroed. \n\nOutput row 9: [1,0,...,0,2].\n\nRow 10 input: [1,0,0,8,0,...,0,2]. Non-zero:8 (col3). Doesn't match, so zeroed.\n\nRow 11 and 12: same as row 4.\n\nSo the test output would have:\n\nRow 0: same.\n\nRow 1: same.\n\nRow 2: [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2].\n\nRow 3: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]. Wait, but the original row 3's last element is 2, and the 3 becomes zero. The 2 in column 3 moves to the right.\n\nBut perhaps I need to adjust for exact indices. Let's recheck:\n\nTest input row 3: [1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2]. First is 1, last is 2. Non-zero elements:2 at index 3, 3 at index 14. \n\nThe 2 matches the last element (2), so it moves to the rightmost possible position, which is index 15 (since last is index 16). So output row 3 would be [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]. The 3 is zeroed.\n\nRow 5: input [1,0,...,1,0,7,0,8,0,2]. The 1 at column 5 moves to column 1. 7 and 8 are zeroed. So output row 5 becomes [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7 (no, 7 is zeroed), etc. So [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2].\n\nRow 9: input [1,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2]. The 6 and 4s are zeroed. So output is [1,0,...,0,2].\n\nRow 10: input [1,0,0,8,0,...,0,2]. 8 is zeroed. Output is [1,0,...,0,2].\n\nPutting this all together, the test output would have rows where non-zero elements matching the first or last are moved to their respective edges, and others are zeroed. The final output would look like:\n\n[0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0]\n[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n[1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]\n[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n[1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n[1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]\n[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2]\n[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n[0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0]\n\nBut I'm not confident about this. The main issue is the introduction of the 4 in Example 0's output row 1, which doesn't fit the previous pattern. Without understanding that, it's hard to proceed. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the competition setting, I'll proceed with the pattern where non-zero elements matching the first or last of the row are moved towards their edges, others zeroed. This seems to fit most of the training examples except for the 4 in Example 0's row 1. Maybe there's an exception when the row above has a certain property. But given time constraints, I'll proceed.",
