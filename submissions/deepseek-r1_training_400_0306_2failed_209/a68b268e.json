        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure. Each input is a 9x9 grid (9 lists each with 9 elements). The outputs are 4x4 grids. So, the input is being transformed into a smaller grid. Hmm, maybe the output is derived from certain parts of the input? Let's check the examples.\n\nTake Example 0. The input has a middle row [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. That's probably the center row. The outputs are four rows, each with four elements. Maybe the output is taking elements from the four quadrants around the center. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first four rows (indices 0-3) might be the top half, and rows 5-8 the bottom. The middle row is row 4. So, perhaps the output is combining elements from these quadrants. But how?\n\nLooking at the output for Example 0:\n\n[6,7,7,7]\n[7,7,7,8]\n[8,0,8,4]\n[7,0,0,8]\n\nHmm. Let's check the input. The first four rows (rows 0-3) are:\n\nRow0: [0,7,7,7,1,0,4,0,4]\nRow1: [7,7,7,0,1,4,4,0,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4]\nRow3: [7,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nThen rows 5-8:\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,1,6,6,6,0]\nRow6: [0,0,8,8,1,0,0,0,0]\nRow7: [8,0,8,0,1,6,0,0,6]\nRow8: [0,0,0,8,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe output rows are 4 elements each. Maybe each output row is combining elements from the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right quadrants? Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell is a combination of four cells from the input. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's output first row [6,7,7,7], where does the 6 come from? Looking at the input's row 5 (index 5) is [0,0,0,0,1,6,6,6,0]. The element at position 5 (0-based) is 6. But how does that connect to the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking specific positions from each of the four quadrants. Let's divide the input grid into four quadrants around the center row and column. Since the middle is row 4 and column 4 (since each row has 9 elements, so middle is index 4). So the four quadrants would be:\n\nTop-left: rows 0-3, columns 0-3\nTop-right: rows 0-3, columns 5-8\nBottom-left: rows 5-8, columns 0-3\nBottom-right: rows 5-8, columns 5-8\n\nWait, but in a 9x9 grid, splitting into quadrants would split around the center. The middle row is index 4, middle column is index 4. So each quadrant would be 4x4? Because from 0-3 rows and columns for top-left, etc. But each row has 9 elements, so columns 0-3 (4 elements), column 4 is the center, then columns 5-8 (4 elements). Similarly rows 0-3, row 4, rows 5-8.\n\nSo each quadrant (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) would be 4x4 grids. Then perhaps the output is combining elements from these quadrants in some way. Let's check.\n\nFor Example 0's output, the first row [6,7,7,7]. Let's see where 6 comes from. In the bottom-left quadrant (rows 5-8, columns 0-3). Looking at row 5: columns 0-3 are [0,0,0,0]. Row 6 columns 0-3: [0,0,8,8]. Row7: [8,0,8,0]. Row8: [0,0,0,8]. Hmm, maybe taking the last non-zero element from each row in the bottom-left quadrant?\n\nRow5 bottom-left: [0,0,0,0] \u2192 perhaps 0, but the output starts with 6. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, looking at the bottom-right quadrant (rows 5-8, columns 5-8). For row5, columns5-8: [6,6,6,0]. The first element here is 6. But the output's first element is 6. Let's check if this is part of a pattern.\n\nIn Example0's output, the first row has 6,7,7,7. Let's see:\n\nTop-right quadrant (rows0-3, columns5-8). For row0: [0,4,0,4]. Row1: [4,4,0,0]. Row2: [0,0,0,4]. Row3: [0,0,0,0]. The elements here might be 0,4,0, etc. But the output's first row has 6,7,7,7. Maybe that's not directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is built from four different quadrants. For example, output row0 could be the first elements of each quadrant, or some combination.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for Example0. The output has four rows. Let's check each element in the output and see where they come from in the input.\n\nTake the first element of the output: 6. Looking at the input, the bottom-left quadrant (rows5-8, columns0-3) for row5, column0 is 0. But in row7, column0 is 8. Not matching. Wait, maybe the output is constructed by taking elements from the four corners of each quadrant?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from the intersection of certain rows and columns. Let me think.\n\nAnother thought: the output has four rows. Maybe each row in the output corresponds to a diagonal in the input. For example, the first output row could be elements along a certain diagonal in the input grid. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element is the sum of certain elements in the input, but that seems less likely given the numbers in the examples.\n\nWait, let's look at the first output of Example0 again:\n\nOutput row0: [6,7,7,7]\n\nLooking at the input's row5 (index5) has elements [0,0,0,0,1,6,6,6,0]. The 6's are in positions5,6,7. But how does that relate to the output?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking elements from the edges of the input grid. For instance, maybe the output is the four corners and some other positions. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\nFirst element 6: in row5, column5 (value6). Second element7: row0, column1 (7). Third element7: row0, column2 (7). Fourth element7: row0, column3 (7). Hmm, that's possible. But why those positions?\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the first row is [6,7,7,7]. Let's see:\n\n6 is in row5, column5 (since the input row5 has 6 at column5). Then 7,7,7 are from row0, columns1,2,3. Then the next output row is [7,7,7,8]. Let's see: 7s could be from row1, columns0,1,2 (7,7,7) and 8 from row7, column0 (8). Hmm, but that might not fit a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is combining elements from different quadrants. For example, first output row could be bottom-right (6), top-left (7,7,7). But how to arrange?\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by taking elements from the intersections of certain rows and columns. For example, the output could be a 4x4 grid formed by taking elements from rows 0,1,2,3 and columns 5,6,7,8 (the top-right quadrant), but in Example0's output the first element is 6 which is not in the top-right.\n\nWait, maybe the output combines elements from the top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right quadrants. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the last non-zero element from each quadrant. Let's check Example0:\n\nTop-left quadrant (rows0-3, columns0-3):\n\nRow0: [0,7,7,7]\nRow1: [7,7,7,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [7,0,0,0]\n\nIf taking the last non-zero element of each row in top-left quadrant:\n\nRow0: 7 (position3)\nRow1:7 (position2)\nRow2:0 (all zeros)\nRow3:7 (position0)\n\nBut how does this relate to the output? The first output row starts with 6, which isn't from here.\n\nHmm, perhaps each output row is a combination of elements from different quadrants. Let's see Example0's output:\n\nRow0: [6,7,7,7]\n\nLooking at the input:\n\n- 6 is in row5, column5 (bottom-right quadrant)\n- 7s are in row0, columns1-3 (top-left quadrant)\n\nSo maybe the first element comes from the bottom-right, the next three from the top-left. But how to determine the positions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output cell is a diagonal from the quadrants. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is a 4x4 grid formed by taking the 4 corners of each quadrant. For example, each quadrant has four corners, and those are arranged into the output. Let's see:\n\nTop-left quadrant corners: row0col0 (0), row0col3 (7), row3col0 (7), row3col3 (0). So corners are 0,7,7,0. Not matching Example0's output.\n\nBottom-right quadrant corners (rows5-8, cols5-8):\n\nRow5cols5-8:6,6,6,0 \u2192 corners 6 and0\nRow8cols5-8:0,0,0,0 \u2192 corners 0 and0. So corners would be 6,0,0,0. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the intersection of the middle row and columns with the quadrants. Wait, the middle row is all 1s, so perhaps not.\n\nWait, another thought: the output has four rows. Maybe each row in the output corresponds to a diagonal in the input. For example, the first output row could be the main diagonal of the top-left quadrant, the second row the main diagonal of the top-right, etc. Let's check.\n\nTop-left quadrant (rows0-3, cols0-3):\n\nMain diagonal would be row0col0 (0), row1col1 (7), row2col2 (0), row3col3 (0). So [0,7,0,0]. Not matching Example0's output.\n\nTop-right quadrant (rows0-3, cols5-8):\n\nMain diagonal: row0col5 (0), row1col6 (4), row2col7 (0), row3col8 (0). So [0,4,0,0]. Also not matching.\n\nBottom-left quadrant (rows5-8, cols0-3):\n\nMain diagonal: row5col0 (0), row6col1 (0), row7col2 (8), row8col3 (8). So [0,0,8,8]. Example0's output's third row starts with 8. Maybe.\n\nBottom-right quadrant (rows5-8, cols5-8):\n\nMain diagonal: row5col5 (6), row6col6 (0), row7col7 (0), row8col8 (0). [6,0,0,0]. Example0's first element is 6. But how does this fit into the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each quadrant contributes one element per output row. For example, output row0 has elements from each quadrant's specific position.\n\nLet's take Example0's output first row: [6,7,7,7]. Suppose each element comes from a different quadrant:\n\n6 from bottom-right, 7s from top-left. Let's see:\n\nBottom-right quadrant's element at position (0,0) would be row5, col5 (6). That's the first element.\n\nThen top-left quadrant's (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) are 7,7,7. So the output row is [6 (from bottom-right), 7 (top-left), 7 (top-left), 7 (top-left)]. That doesn't seem to fit a general pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the four corners of each quadrant. But for each quadrant, there are four corners. So 4 quadrants \u00d74 corners = 16 elements, but the output is 4x4=16 elements. So arranging them in order.\n\nFor example:\n\nFor each quadrant (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), take their four corners and arrange them in the output.\n\nLet's test this for Example0.\n\nTop-left quadrant (rows0-3, cols0-3):\n\nCorners are:\n\nrow0col0:0, row0col3:7,\n\nrow3col0:7, row3col3:0.\n\nSo corners: 0,7,7,0.\n\nTop-right quadrant (rows0-3, cols5-8):\n\nCorners: row0col5:0, row0col8:4,\n\nrow3col5:0, row3col8:0.\n\nCorners:0,4,0,0.\n\nBottom-left quadrant (rows5-8, cols0-3):\n\nCorners: row5col0:0, row5col3:0,\n\nrow8col0:0, row8col3:8.\n\nCorners:0,0,0,8.\n\nBottom-right quadrant (rows5-8, cols5-8):\n\nCorners: row5col5:6, row5col8:0,\n\nrow8col5:0, row8col8:0.\n\nCorners:6,0,0,0.\n\nNow, if the output is a 4x4 matrix where each row is the corners of a quadrant:\n\nFirst row: top-left corners (0,7,7,0)\n\nSecond row: top-right (0,4,0,0)\n\nThird row: bottom-left (0,0,0,8)\n\nFourth row: bottom-right (6,0,0,0)\n\nBut Example0's output is:\n\n[6,7,7,7]\n\n[7,7,7,8]\n\n[8,0,8,4]\n\n[7,0,0,8]\n\nThis doesn't match. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: look at how the elements in the output relate to the input. For Example0's output:\n\nFirst row: 6,7,7,7.\n\nLooking for 6 in input: row5, col5 is 6.\n\n7s: row0, cols1-3 are 7,7,7.\n\nSo perhaps the first element of the output is from the bottom-right quadrant (row5, col5), and the next three from the top-left quadrant (row0, cols1-3).\n\nSecond row of output:7,7,7,8.\n\n7s could be from row1, cols0-2 (7,7,7), and 8 from row7, col0 (8).\n\nThird row:8,0,8,4.\n\n8 from row7, col2 (8), 0 from row5, col0 (0), another 8 from row6, col3 (8?), 4 from row0, col6 (4).\n\nFourth row:7,0,0,8.\n\n7 from row3, col0 (7), 0s from other places, 8 from row8, col3 (8).\n\nThis seems arbitrary, but maybe there's a pattern in how elements are selected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from specific positions relative to the middle (row4, col4). For example, elements that are adjacent to the middle row or column.\n\nBut the middle row is all 1s, and the middle column is all 1s. So perhaps elements adjacent to the middle.\n\nLooking at Example0's output first element 6. In input, row5, col5 is 6. Which is diagonally adjacent to the center (row4, col4). Similarly, the 7s in row0, cols1-3 are adjacent in their rows to the middle column (col4). But that may not form a clear pattern.\n\nAnother angle: the output is 4x4, and the input is 9x9. Maybe each output row is a combination of four elements from specific positions in the input. Let's check the output rows across examples.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nRow0:6,7,7,7 \u2192 6 is from row5 col5, 7s from row0 cols1-3.\n\nRow1:7,7,7,8 \u2192 7s from row1 cols0-2, 8 from row7 col0.\n\nRow2:8,0,8,4 \u2192 8s from row7 col2 and row6 col3, 0 from row5 col0, 4 from row0 col6.\n\nRow3:7,0,0,8 \u2192 7 from row3 col0, 0s from row3 cols1-2, 8 from row8 col3.\n\nHmm, perhaps each output row corresponds to a specific input row, but the columns are selected in a certain way. For example, output row0 takes elements from row5 (6), row0 (7,7,7). But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by taking elements from the input grid in a spiral order, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions of the elements in the output for all examples and see if there's a common pattern.\n\nTake Example0:\n\nOutput row0:6 (row5, col5), 7 (row0, col1),7 (row0, col2),7 (row0, col3).\n\nRow1:7 (row1, col0),7 (row1, col1),7 (row1, col2),8 (row7, col0).\n\nRow2:8 (row7, col2),0 (row5, col0),8 (row6, col3),4 (row0, col6).\n\nRow3:7 (row3, col0),0 (row3, col1),0 (row3, col2),8 (row8, col3).\n\nThis seems too scattered. Maybe not. Let's check another example.\n\nExample1's output:\n\n[7,7,7,6]\n\n[7,0,7,4]\n\n[4,7,4,7]\n\n[8,8,8,7]\n\nLooking at input for Example1:\n\nInput rows0-3:\n\nRow0:7,7,7,0,1,0,4,0,0\n\nRow1:7,0,7,0,1,4,0,4,4\n\nRow2:0,7,0,7,1,4,0,4,4\n\nRow3:0,0,0,7,1,0,0,0,0\n\nRows5-8:\n\nRow5:0,0,8,0,1,6,0,0,6\n\nRow6:0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0\n\nRow7:0,0,0,0,1,6,6,0,6\n\nRow8:8,8,8,0,1,6,0,6,6\n\nOutput row0:7,7,7,6. Let's see where these come from.\n\n7s: row0 cols0-2 (7,7,7). 6: row5 col8 (6). So the first three elements are from the top-left quadrant (row0 cols0-2) and the fourth from bottom-right (row5 col8).\n\nRow1:7 (row1 col0),0 (row1 col1),7 (row1 col2),4 (row1 col7). \n\nRow2:4 (row0 col6?), 7 (row2 col1),4 (row2 col6?), 7 (row3 col3). \n\nHmm, this is inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell corresponds to the sum of certain cells, but given the numbers, that's unlikely. For instance, in Example0, 6 is a standalone number, not a sum.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking elements from the input in a specific pattern that moves outward from the center. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the output rows, they all have four elements. Maybe each output row is made by taking the non-zero elements from a particular part of the input. For example, the first output row could be the first four non-zero elements in the input's bottom-right quadrant. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0, the bottom-right quadrant (rows5-8, cols5-8):\n\nRow5:6,6,6,0\n\nRow6:0,0,0,0\n\nRow7:6,0,0,6\n\nRow8:0,0,0,0\n\nThe non-zero elements here are 6,6,6,6,6. So first four are 6,6,6,6. But the output's first row starts with 6 followed by three 7s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the output is constructed by looking for the first occurrence of each number in a certain order. But that's too vague.\n\nWait, let's think about the output structure. Each example's output is a 4x4 grid. The test input is also a 9x9 grid. The output in training examples seems to have elements that appear in the input, but arranged differently. \n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nThe numbers present are 6,7,8,4,0. All of these are present in the input. \n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking elements from the input's four corners and then some diagonals or other key points. For example:\n\nTop-left corner (0,0), top-right (0,8), bottom-left (8,0), bottom-right (8,8). But the output has more elements than that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each quadrant contributes four elements to the output. For example, the top-left quadrant contributes elements to the first row of the output, top-right to the second, etc. But how?\n\nIn Example0, the top-left quadrant (rows0-3, cols0-3) has elements:\n\nRow0:0,7,7,7\n\nRow1:7,7,7,0\n\nRow2:0,0,0,0\n\nRow3:7,0,0,0\n\nIf we take the first non-zero elements from each row in this quadrant, we get [7 (row0),7 (row1),0 (row2),7 (row3)]. But the first output row starts with 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is formed by taking elements from a specific position in each quadrant. For example, first element of each output row is from the bottom-right quadrant, then from top-left, etc. But how to determine the positions.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by rotating each quadrant and taking certain elements. For example, rotating the top-left quadrant 90 degrees and then taking the first row. Let's try:\n\nTop-left quadrant in Example0:\n\nRow0:0,7,7,7\n\nRow1:7,7,7,0\n\nRow2:0,0,0,0\n\nRow3:7,0,0,0\n\nRotating this 90 degrees clockwise would make the columns into rows reversed. The first row after rotation would be 7,0,7,0. Doesn't match the output.\n\nHmm. Maybe not.\n\nLet me think of another angle. The outputs in the examples have elements that seem to be from the edges of the input. For instance, in Example0's output, the 8s come from the bottom-left and bottom-right quadrants.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions of each element in the output and see if there's a pattern in their coordinates.\n\nTake Example0's output:\n\nFirst row:6 (row5, col5), 7 (row0, col1), 7 (row0, col2), 7 (row0, col3).\n\nSecond row:7 (row1, col0),7 (row1, col1),7 (row1, col2),8 (row7, col0).\n\nThird row:8 (row7, col2),0 (row5, col0),8 (row6, col3),4 (row0, col6).\n\nFourth row:7 (row3, col0),0 (row3, col1),0 (row3, col2),8 (row8, col3).\n\nLooking at these coordinates, perhaps each output element's position in the output corresponds to a certain combination of input row and column. For example, output row i, column j could be from input row (i*2) and column (j*2), but let's check.\n\nFor example, output row0, col0:6 is from input row5, col5. If i=0, j=0: 0*2=0, but input row5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe output row0 is formed by elements from row5, row0, row0, row0. That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from the input grid's positions (i, j) where i + j is even or odd. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the input in a cross pattern around the center. For example, elements that are in the same row or column as the center (row4, col4), but offset by certain steps.\n\nThe center is row4, col4. Let's see:\n\nFor Example0's first output element,6 is at row5, col5, which is one step down and right from the center. Then 7 is at row0, col1, which is four steps up and three left. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output consists of four 2x2 blocks from the input. For example, each 2x2 block is taken from a different part of the input. Let's check.\n\nExample0's output:\n\nRow0:6,7,7,7 \u2192 perhaps two 2x2 blocks. 6 and7 from one block, 7 and7 from another.\n\nBut 6 is in row5, col5. The 7s are in row0, cols1-3. Not adjacent.\n\nThis approach doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother possibility: Each output row corresponds to a diagonal in the input. For example, the first output row could be elements along the diagonal from row5, col5 to row0, col3. Let's check:\n\nrow5,col5 (6) \u2192 row4,col4 (1) \u2192 row3,col3 (0) \u2192 row2,col2 (0) \u2192 row1,col1 (7) \u2192 row0,col0 (0). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements are from the input's anti-diagonal. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let's think about the numbers. For example, in Example0's output, the first row has 6 followed by three 7s. The 6 could be the first non-zero element encountered in a specific quadrant, and the 7s from another. \n\nWait, let's consider that each output row corresponds to a specific quadrant, and elements are taken in a certain order. For example:\n\n- Output row0: elements from the bottom-right quadrant, read left to right, top to bottom.\n\n- Output row1: elements from the top-left quadrant.\n\nBut in Example0's output row0 starts with 6 which is in the bottom-right quadrant. Let's see:\n\nBottom-right quadrant (rows5-8, cols5-8):\n\nRow5:6,6,6,0\n\nRow6:0,0,0,0\n\nRow7:0,0,0,6\n\nRow8:0,0,0,0\n\nIf we read left to right, top to bottom: 6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,... but the first row of the output is [6,7,7,7]. Not matching.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is the maximum value from each corresponding 2x2 block in the input. Let's check.\n\nThe input is 9x9. Divided into 2x2 blocks (with possible overlaps or not). For example, first block rows0-1, cols0-1. But this would give many blocks. However, the output is 4x4, which suggests 4x4 blocks. Wait, but 9x9 can't be evenly divided into 4x4 2x2 blocks. So this may not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the top-left 4x4 of the input. But in Example0, the top-left 4x4 starts with 0,7,7,7 which would be the first row of the output. But Example0's output first row is [6,7,7,7], which doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nEach row has four elements. The first row starts with 6, which is in the bottom-right quadrant (row5, col5). The next three are 7s from the top-left quadrant (row0, cols1-3).\n\nThe second row starts with 7s from the top-left (row1, cols0-2) and ends with 8 from the bottom-left (row7, col0).\n\nThe third row starts with 8 from the bottom-left (row7, col2), 0 from bottom-left (row5, col0), another 8 from bottom-left (row6, col3), and 4 from top-right (row0, col6).\n\nThe fourth row has 7 from top-left (row3, col0), 0s from top-left (row3, cols1-2), and 8 from bottom-left (row8, col3).\n\nThis suggests that each row in the output is formed by elements from different quadrants, possibly in a spiral or some other order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row corresponds to a specific input row, but only certain columns are selected. For example, output row0 might be col5 from row5, cols1-3 from row0. But how to generalize this.\n\nAnother pattern: Looking at Example0's output:\n\nRow0:6,7,7,7 \u2192 6 from row5, 7s from row0.\n\nRow1:7,7,7,8 \u2192 7s from row1, 8 from row7.\n\nRow2:8,0,8,4 \u2192 8 from row7 and row6, 0 from row5,4 from row0.\n\nRow3:7,0,0,8 \u21927 from row3, 8 from row8.\n\nSo each output row seems to take elements from different input rows, possibly in reverse order (row5, row0, row1, row7, row3, etc.). This is very unstructured.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to a certain distance from the center. For example, elements that are k steps away from the center in certain directions.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to find a common pattern in all examples.\n\nLooking at Example1's input and output:\n\nOutput row0:7,7,7,6. These 7s come from row0's first three elements (7,7,7), and 6 from row5's col8 (6).\n\nRow1:7,0,7,4. 7 from row1 col0, 0 from row1 col1,7 from row1 col2,4 from row1 col7.\n\nRow2:4,7,4,7. 4 from row0 col6,7 from row2 col1,4 from row2 col6,7 from row3 col3.\n\nRow3:8,8,8,7. 8s from row8's first three elements (8,8,8), and7 from row3 col3.\n\nHmm. It seems that for each output row, elements are taken from different rows and columns, possibly in a way that the output's first element is from row5, then row0, row1, etc. But this doesn't form a clear rule.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from the input in a specific order, such as reading the input in a certain way and picking every nth element. But the output size is 16 elements, and the input has 81. So 81/16 is not a whole number. So this may not work.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the result of some mathematical operation between input elements, but the examples don't show clear sums or products.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output, the first element is 6 from row5, col5. In the input, row5 is the first row after the middle row. The middle row is index4. So row5 is the first row below the middle. Col5 is the first column to the right of the middle column.\n\nIn the output's first row, the first element is from the first row below the middle and first column to the right. Then, the next three elements are from row0, columns1-3.\n\nThis seems like a stretch, but maybe there's a pattern where each output row takes elements from a specific relative position around the center.\n\nFor example:\n\nOutput row0: elements from (middle+1, middle+1), (middle-4, middle-3), (middle-4, middle-2), (middle-4, middle-1).\n\nBut middle is at (4,4). So (5,5), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3). Which matches Example0's first row elements:6 (5,5),7 (0,1),7 (0,2),7 (0,3).\n\nYes! This could be the pattern. Let's check other elements.\n\nOutput row1:7,7,7,8.\n\nThe first element would be (middle+1, middle-4) \u2192 (5,0). Input row5, col0 is 0. But Example0's row1 first element is7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is formed by elements from specific positions relative to the center, but varying per row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell corresponds to a position that's offset from the center by the output's row and column indices.\n\nFor example, output cell (i,j) corresponds to input cell (4 + (i-1), 4 + (j-1)), but that's speculative.\n\nWait, let's try for Example0's first output row, cell (0,0):6. Input cell (5,5) is6. So 4+1=5, 4+1=5. So i=0 corresponds to +1 in both directions.\n\nCell (0,1):7 in input cell (0,1). Which would be 4-4=0 (row), 4-3=1 (col). So maybe row is 4 - (output row * something) + output column * something.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe there's another way.\n\nLooking at all training examples, perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from the input in a specific way such that each output row is a combination of elements from the four quadrants, perhaps in a clockwise or counter-clockwise manner.\n\nFor example, the first output row takes elements from the bottom-right, top-left, top-right, and bottom-left quadrants. But I need to verify.\n\nIn Example0's output row0:6 (bottom-right), 7 (top-left),7 (top-left),7 (top-left). That doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: The output is formed by reading the input grid in a certain order and picking elements that are not 1 or 0, but that's not the case. For example, Example0's output has zeros.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking elements from the input's non-middle rows and columns, but this is too vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compare the input and output of each example to find a common transformation.\n\nLooking at Example0's input and output:\n\nOutput row0:6,7,7,7 \u2192 input has 6 at row5, col5. The 7s are in row0, cols1-3.\n\nOutput row1:7,7,7,8 \u2192 7s in row1, cols0-2. 8 in row7, col0.\n\nOutput row2:8,0,8,4 \u2192 8 in row7, col2; 0 in row5, col0; 8 in row6, col3; 4 in row0, col6.\n\nOutput row3:7,0,0,8 \u21927 in row3, col0; 0s in row3, cols1-2; 8 in row8, col3.\n\nObserving that:\n\n- The first element of each output row comes from different rows: row5, row1, row7, row3.\n\n- The second element comes from row0, row1, row5, row3.\n\nBut this doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows might be formed by taking elements from the input rows in a certain order. For example:\n\nRow0 of output takes elements from input rows 5,0,0,0.\n\nRow1 takes from rows1,1,1,7.\n\nRow2 takes from rows7,5,6,0.\n\nRow3 takes from rows3,3,3,8.\n\nBut this is not a clear pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the first four non-zero elements from each quadrant in a specific order. Let's check:\n\nFor Example0's bottom-right quadrant (rows5-8, cols5-8):\n\nElements are 6,6,6,0 (row5), then 0,0,0,0 (row6), 0,0,0,6 (row7), 0,0,0,0 (row8). The first non-zero here is6. So output row0's first element is6.\n\nThen, the top-left quadrant (rows0-3, cols0-3) has elements:\n\nRow0:0,7,7,7 \u2192 non-zeros are7,7,7.\n\nRow1:7,7,7,0 \u2192 non-zeros are7,7,7.\n\nRow2:0,0,0,0 \u2192 no non-zeros.\n\nRow3:7,0,0,0 \u2192 non-zero is7.\n\nSo combining the non-zeros from top-left:7,7,7,7,7,7,7. The first three are taken for output row0's next three elements:7,7,7.\n\nSo output row0:6,7,7,7.\n\nSimilarly, output row1: take the next non-zero elements. From bottom-right quadrant, the next non-zero after6 is6 (row5, col6), then6 (row5, col7), then6 (row7, col8). But in output row1, the first element is7. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each quadrant contributes one element per output row, in a specific order.\n\nAnother Idea: The output's rows correspond to the four quadrants, and the columns correspond to layers or directions within each quadrant.\n\nFor example, each quadrant's elements are read in a certain order (e.g., clockwise) and the first four elements form the output rows.\n\nBut this requires more analysis.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nTop-left quadrant:\n\n0 7 7 7\n\n7 7 7 0\n\n0 0 0 0\n\n7 0 0 0\n\nIf read in a spiral order starting from top-left, the elements would be0,7,7,7,0,0,0,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,7. But this doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, reading columns from top to bottom, left to right:\n\nColumn0:0,7,0,7 \u2192 0,7,0,7.\n\nColumn1:7,7,0,0 \u21927,7,0,0.\n\nColumn2:7,7,0,0 \u21927,7,0,0.\n\nColumn3:7,0,0,0 \u21927,0,0,0.\n\nIf we take the first four elements from each column, it's 0,7,0,7 for column0, but this doesn't match the output.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a pattern that works across multiple examples.\n\nLooking at Example1's output:\n\n[7,7,7,6]\n\n[7,0,7,4]\n\n[4,7,4,7]\n\n[8,8,8,7]\n\nFirst row:7s from row0 cols0-2,6 from row5 col8.\n\nSecond row:7 from row1 col0,0 from row1 col1,7 from row1 col2,4 from row1 col7.\n\nThird row:4 from row0 col6,7 from row2 col1,4 from row2 col6,7 from row3 col3.\n\nFourth row:8s from row8 cols0-2,7 from row3 col3.\n\nObserving that:\n\n- The first element of each output row comes from different quadrants:\n\nRow0: top-left and bottom-right.\n\nRow1: top-left and top-right.\n\nRow2: top-right and top-left.\n\nRow3: bottom-left and top-right.\n\nBut I can't see a clear pattern.\n\nAnother Idea: The output is a mirror or rotation of certain parts. For example, the output might be the top-right quadrant mirrored and combined with the bottom-left quadrant. But this needs verification.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 4x4 matrix where each row is the diagonal of a quadrant. For example, top-left's diagonal, top-right's diagonal, etc.\n\nFor Example0's top-left diagonal:0,7,0,0 \u2192 not matching output.\n\nTop-right's diagonal:0,4,0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nBottom-left's diagonal:0,0,8,8 \u2192 possible. Example0's third row starts with8.\n\nBottom-right's diagonal:6,0,0,0 \u2192 possible. Example0's first element is6.\n\nBut combining these diagonals would give rows [6,0,0,0], [0,4,0,0], [0,0,8,8], [0,0,0,0], which doesn't match the output.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nAt this point, I think the pattern might involve taking elements from specific positions in the input's quadrants. For each output row, the elements are taken from different quadrants in a specific order. For example:\n\nRow0: bottom-right (one element), top-left (three elements)\n\nRow1: top-left (three elements), bottom-left (one element)\n\nRow2: bottom-left (two elements), top-right (one element), bottom-right (one element)\n\nRow3: top-left (one element), bottom-left (two elements), bottom-right (one element)\n\nBut this is too ad-hoc and not systematic.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a result of overlaying the four quadrants and selecting elements where they have non-zero values. For example, taking the maximum or sum of each corresponding position in the four quadrants. But looking at Example0's output:\n\nIf we take the sum of each position across quadrants:\n\nFor position (0,0):\n\nTop-left quadrant (0,0) \u21920\n\nTop-right (0,0) \u21920 (row0, col5=0)\n\nBottom-left (0,0) \u21920 (row5, col0=0)\n\nBottom-right (0,0) \u21926 (row5, col5=6)\n\nSum would be6+0+0+0=6 \u2192 matches output's first element6.\n\nNext position (0,1):\n\nTop-left (0,1)=7\n\nTop-right (0,1)=4 (row0, col6=4)\n\nBottom-left (0,1)=0 (row5, col1=0)\n\nBottom-right (0,1)=6 (row5, col6=6)\n\nSum:7+4+0+6=17 \u2192 not matching output's7.\n\nSo sum is not the case. Maybe maximum:\n\nMax of 0,0,0,6 \u21926. But output's second element is7. So this is not it.\n\nAlternatively, take the value from the quadrant that has a non-zero, prioritizing certain quadrants.\n\nFor position (0,0) in output, take bottom-right's value (6). For position (0,1), take top-left's 7. But how to decide the order of priority.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\nPosition (0,0):6 (bottom-right)\n\nPosition (0,1):7 (top-left)\n\nPosition (0,2):7 (top-left)\n\nPosition (0,3):7 (top-left)\n\nSo for the first row, it's taking the first element from bottom-right, then the next three from top-left.\n\nFor the second row of output:\n\nPositions (1,0):7 (top-left)\n\n(1,1):7 (top-left)\n\n(1,2):7 (top-left)\n\n(1,3):8 (bottom-left)\n\nSo first three from top-left, last from bottom-left.\n\nThird row:\n\n(2,0):8 (bottom-left)\n\n(2,1):0 (bottom-left)\n\n(2,2):8 (bottom-left)\n\n(2,3):4 (top-right)\n\nSo two from bottom-left, one from top-right.\n\nFourth row:\n\n(3,0):7 (top-left)\n\n(3,1):0 (top-left)\n\n(3,2):0 (top-left)\n\n(3,3):8 (bottom-left)\n\nSo three from top-left, one from bottom-left.\n\nThis seems arbitrary, but maybe the pattern is that for each output row, the elements are taken from different quadrants in the order: bottom-right, top-left, bottom-left, top-right. But the order varies per row.\n\nAlternatively, the output is built by reading each quadrant in a certain order and taking elements in a specific sequence. For example, bottom-right is read first, then top-left, then bottom-left, then top-right. Then each quadrant's elements are read row-wise.\n\nFor Example0's output:\n\nBottom-right quadrant:\n\nRow5:6,6,6,0\n\nRow6:0,0,0,0\n\nRow7:0,0,0,6\n\nRow8:0,0,0,0\n\nRead row-wise:6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0. The first non-zero is6.\n\nTop-left quadrant:\n\nRow0:0,7,7,7\n\nRow1:7,7,7,0\n\nRow2:0,0,0,0\n\nRow3:7,0,0,0\n\nRead row-wise:0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0. The first non-zero is7, followed by7,7,7,7, etc.\n\nIf the output is formed by taking the first non-zero element from each quadrant in order, but this seems to not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking elements from the input grid in a specific order that snakes through the quadrants. For example, starting from the bottom-right quadrant, then top-left, then bottom-left, then top-right, taking elements in a certain pattern.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, this is guesswork.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I think the best approach is to look for the pattern used in the training examples and apply it to the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0] \u2192 row0\n[0, 7, 7, 0, 1, 4, 4, 0, 4] \u2192 row1\n[7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0, 4, 0, 4] \u2192 row2\n[7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 0, 4, 0] \u2192 row3\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] \u2192 row4 (middle)\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 6, 0, 6] \u2192 row5\n[8, 0, 0, 8, 1, 6, 0, 0, 6] \u2192 row6\n[8, 0, 8, 0, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6] \u2192 row7\n[0, 8, 0, 8, 1, 0, 6, 0, 0] \u2192 row8\n\nThe output needs to be a 4x4 grid. Based on the training examples, the output seems to take elements from specific positions in the input, possibly from the quadrants around the center.\n\nAssuming that each output row is formed by elements from different quadrants:\n\nFor example:\n\nRow0: elements from bottom-right quadrant (row5-8, col5-8). For row5, col5=0, col6=6, col7=0, col8=6. The first non-zero here is6 at col6. But the first element in the output might be6.\n\nBut looking at Example0's output, the first element came from row5, col5 (6). So maybe the first element of the output is the element at row5, col5 of the input.\n\nFor the test input, row5, col5 is0. But looking at other examples, sometimes the first element is from row5, col5. For Example1, the first element is7, which is not from row5, col5 (which is6). So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the first element comes from the bottom-right quadrant's first non-zero element. In test input's bottom-right quadrant (rows5-8, cols5-8):\n\nRow5:0,6,0,6 \u2192 elements at 5,5:0;5,6:6;5,7:0;5,8:6.\n\nRow6:6,0,0,6 \u21926,0,0,6.\n\nRow7:6,6,6,6.\n\nRow8:0,6,0,0.\n\nThe first non-zero in this quadrant is6 at row5, col6.\n\nBut Example0's first element was from row5, col5. So maybe not.\n\nAnother observation: In the training examples, the outputs often have elements from the input's rows 0,1,2,3 (top half), and rows5,6,7,8 (bottom half), excluding the middle row4.\n\nLooking at the test input's possible elements for the output:\n\nTop-left quadrant (rows0-3, cols0-3):\n\nRow0:7,7,7,0 \u2192 cols0-3 are7,7,7,0.\n\nRow1:0,7,7,0.\n\nRow2:7,7,7,7.\n\nRow3:7,0,0,0.\n\nTop-right quadrant (rows0-3, cols5-8):\n\nRow0:0,0,4,0 \u2192 cols5-8:0,0,4,0.\n\nRow1:4,4,0,4.\n\nRow2:0,4,0,4.\n\nRow3:4,0,4,0.\n\nBottom-left quadrant (rows5-8, cols0-3):\n\nRow5:0,0,0,8.\n\nRow6:8,0,0,8.\n\nRow7:8,0,8,0.\n\nRow8:0,8,0,8.\n\nBottom-right quadrant (rows5-8, cols5-8):\n\nRow5:0,6,0,6.\n\nRow6:6,0,0,6.\n\nRow7:6,6,6,6.\n\nRow8:0,0,0,0.\n\nNow, looking at the training examples' outputs, they often take elements from the bottom-left and bottom-right quadrants for the first element of each row, then from the top-left.\n\nFor example, in Example0's output, the first element of each row comes from the bottom-right, then the next elements from top-left.\n\nIn the test input, perhaps the output's first row is formed by elements from the bottom-right quadrant's first non-zero, then from the top-left.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by taking the first non-zero element from each quadrant in the order: bottom-right, top-left, bottom-left, top-right. For each output row, one element from each quadrant.\n\nFor example, output row0:\n\n- bottom-right quadrant's first non-zero:6 (row5, col6)\n\n- top-left's first non-zero:7 (row0, col0)\n\n- bottom-left's first non-zero:0 (row5, col0)\n\n- top-right's first non-zero:0 (row0, col5)\n\nBut this would give [6,7,0,0], which doesn't match the format of the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, each output row corresponds to a specific quadrant's elements. For example:\n\nRow0: bottom-right quadrant's elements\n\nRow1: top-left quadrant's elements\n\nRow2: bottom-left quadrant's elements\n\nRow3: top-right quadrant's elements\n\nBut the output is 4x4, so each quadrant's elements would need to form a 4x4 grid. But each quadrant is 4x4 (rows0-3, cols0-3, etc.), so taking those elements would make sense.\n\nWait, if each quadrant is 4x4 (rows0-3, cols0-3 for top-left), then each quadrant has 16 elements. But the output is 4x4. So perhaps each quadrant is compressed into one row of the output by taking the first four elements row-wise.\n\nFor example, output row0 is the first four elements of the bottom-right quadrant.\n\nBut in Example0, the bottom-right quadrant is rows5-8, cols5-8:\n\nRow5:6,6,6,0\n\nRow6:0,0,0,0\n\nRow7:0,0,0,6\n\nRow8:0,0,0,0\n\nFirst four elements row-wise:6,6,6,0. But Example0's first output row is [6,7,7,7], which doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This suggests that this is not the pattern.\n\nAfter struggling for so long, I think the pattern might be that each output row is formed by taking elements from the input's rows in a certain order, specifically:\n\nThe output's four rows correspond to the four rows immediately above and below the middle row. For example, rows3,5, then rows2,6, etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking elements from the input rows in the order of rows 5,0,7,3 for the four output rows. Let's check:\n\nTest input row5: [0,0,0,8,1,0,6,0,6]\n\nTaking elements from row5: maybe cols0-3 \u2192 0,0,0,8 \u2192 but how does this fit?\n\nAlternatively, taking elements from specific columns in each row.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first four non-zero elements from specific rows.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nLooking for non-zero elements in certain rows.\n\nFor example, row0:7,7,7,0,1,0,0,4,0 \u2192 non-zero:7,7,7,4.\n\nRow1:0,7,7,0,1,4,4,0,4 \u2192 non-zero:7,7,4,4,4.\n\nRow2:7,7,7,7,1,0,4,0,4 \u2192 non-zero:7,7,7,7,4,4.\n\nRow3:7,0,0,0,1,4,0,4,0 \u2192 non-zero:7,4,4.\n\nRow5:0,0,0,8,1,0,6,0,6 \u2192 non-zero:8,6,6.\n\nRow6:8,0,0,8,1,6,0,0,6 \u2192 non-zero:8,8,6,6.\n\nRow7:8,0,8,0,1,6,6,6,6 \u2192 non-zero:8,8,6,6,6,6.\n\nRow8:0,8,0,8,1,0,6,0,0 \u2192 non-zero:8,8,6.\n\nSo perhaps each output row takes the first four non-zero elements from a particular input row.\n\nBut in Example0's output, the first row is [6,7,7,7], which includes 6 from row5 and 7s from row0. So not from a single row.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the numbers in the outputs. In the training examples, outputs often have numbers that are present in the corresponding input's quadrants.\n\nFor the test input, the output might take elements from the four corners of each quadrant or other specific positions.\n\nFor example, taking the following elements from each quadrant:\n\nTop-left quadrant (rows0-3, cols0-3):\n\nCorners:0,3 \u2192 row0col0=7, row0col3=0, row3col0=7, row3col3=0.\n\nTop-right quadrant (rows0-3, cols5-8):\n\nCorners: row0col5=0, row0col8=0, row3col5=4, row3col8=0.\n\nBottom-left quadrant (rows5-8, cols0-3):\n\nCorners: row5col0=0, row5col3=8, row8col0=0, row8col3=8.\n\nBottom-right quadrant (rows5-8, cols5-8):\n\nCorners: row5col5=0, row5col8=6, row8col5=0, row8col8=0.\n\nIf the output is made by taking the corners of each quadrant and arranging them in some order, it could be:\n\nFor each quadrant, corners in order: [7,0,7,0], [0,0,4,0], [0,8,0,8], [0,6,0,0].\n\nBut arranging these into a 4x4 grid isn't clear. Maybe each row of the output is the corners of a quadrant. For example:\n\nRow0:7,0,7,0 (top-left corners)\n\nRow1:0,0,4,0 (top-right)\n\nRow2:0,8,0,8 (bottom-left)\n\nRow3:0,6,0,0 (bottom-right)\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' outputs.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and lack of a clear pattern, I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the training examples. \n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe bottom-right quadrant (rows5-8, cols5-8):\n\nRow5:0,6,0,6\n\nRow6:6,0,0,6\n\nRow7:6,6,6,6\n\nRow8:0,0,0,0\n\nThe first non-zero here is6 at row5, col6.\n\nTop-left quadrant (rows0-3, cols0-3):\n\nRow0:7,7,7,0\n\nRow1:0,7,7,0\n\nRow2:7,7,7,7\n\nRow3:7,0,0,0\n\nThe first non-zero elements are7s.\n\nBottom-left quadrant (rows5-8, cols0-3):\n\nRow5:0,0,0,8\n\nRow6:8,0,0,8\n\nRow7:8,0,8,0\n\nRow8:0,8,0,8\n\nNon-zero elements:8s.\n\nTop-right quadrant (rows0-3, cols5-8):\n\nRow0:0,0,4,0\n\nRow1:4,4,0,4\n\nRow2:0,4,0,4\n\nRow3:4,0,4,0\n\nNon-zero elements:4s.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the outputs often combine elements from different quadrants. For example, the first element might come from the bottom-right, then the next three from the top-left.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nOutput row0:6 (from row5, col6),7 (row0, col0),7 (row0, col1),7 (row0, col2).\n\nRow1:8 (row6, col0),7 (row1, col1),7 (row1, col2),4 (row1, col5).\n\nRow2:8 (row7, col0),8 (row7, col2),6 (row7, col5),6 (row7, col6).\n\nRow3:4 (row3, col5),8 (row8, col3),6 (row8, col6),8 (row8, col3 again?).\n\nBut this is just a guess. Alternatively, considering the training examples, the output rows often start with an element from the bottom quadrant and then elements from the top.\n\nFor the test input, possible output:\n\nRow0:6 (row5, col6),7 (row0, col0),7 (row0, col1),7 (row0, col2)\n\nRow1:8 (row6, col0),7 (row1, col1),7 (row1, col2),4 (row1, col5)\n\nRow2:8 (row7, col0),8 (row7, col2),6 (row5, col8),6 (row7, col5)\n\nRow3:7 (row3, col0),4 (row3, col5),6 (row5, col6),8 (row6, col3)\n\nBut this is speculative. Another approach: looking at the training examples' outputs, the first row often has elements from the bottom-right and top-left quadrants. The second row from the top-left and bottom-left. The third from bottom-left and top-right. The fourth from top-left and bottom-left.\n\nGiven the test input's quadrants, possible output could be:\n\n[6,7,7,7]\n\n[8,7,7,4]\n\n[8,8,6,6]\n\n[7,4,6,8]\n\nBut formatting it into four rows with four elements each. This is a guess, but based on the training examples, the answer might be:\n\n[6,7,7,7]\n\n[8,7,7,4]\n\n[8,8,6,6]\n\n[7,4,6,8]\n\nBut I need to check against the training examples' pattern. For instance, Example0's first output row has 6 from bottom-right, then 7s from top-left. Similarly, the test input's first row could be6 (row5,col6), then7s from row0.\n\nThe second row in Example0 takes 7s from row1 and8 from row7. In the test input, perhaps the second row is7s from row1 and8 from row6.\n\nThird row in Example0 has 8s from row7 and row6, and4 from row0. In the test input, third row could be8s from row7 and row6, and6 from row7.\n\nFourth row in Example0 has7 from row3 and8 from row8. In test input, seventh row's fourth row could be7 from row3 and8 from row8.\n\nSo the possible output for the test input is:\n\n[6,7,7,7]\n\n[8,7,7,4]\n\n[8,8,6,6]\n\n[7,4,6,8]\n\nBut to match the training examples' format, the actual answer might be:\n\n[6,7,7,7]\n\n[7,7,4,0]\n\n[8,8,6,6]\n\n[0,8,0,6]\n\nBut this is a guess. Another possibility is that each output row is made by taking the first element from the bottom-right quadrant, then the next three from the top-left quadrant.\n\nIn test input's bottom-right quadrant, first non-zero is6 at row5, col6. Then top-left quadrant's first three non-zero elements are7,7,7 (row0).\n\nSo first output row:6,7,7,7.\n\nSecond row: maybe first element from bottom-left quadrant's first non-zero (8 at row5, col3), then three from top-left's next non-zero elements (row1's 7,7,0). But this gives8,7,7,0. But looking at training examples, sometimes the second row starts with elements from the top-left.\n\nAlternatively, second row could be from the bottom-left quadrant's elements. For test input's bottom-left quadrant:\n\nRow5:0,0,0,8\n\nRow6:8,0,0,8\n\nRow7:8,0,8,0\n\nRow8:0,8,0,8\n\nThe first non-zero in this quadrant is8 at row5, col3. Then row6, col0:8. row7, col0:8. row7, col2:8. So perhaps the second row is8,8,8,8. But the output has four elements.\n\nAlternatively, the second row takes elements from the top-left quadrant's row1, which is0,7,7,0. The first non-zero here is7. So second row might be7,7,7,4 (from row1's elements and possibly a 4 from top-right).\n\nThis is very uncertain. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make a best guess based on the training examples and the test input's structure.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 9x9 grid (since each example has 9 rows, each with 9 elements). The outputs are 4-element lists. My task is to see how the input grids are transformed into these output lists.\n\nLet me start by examining the first example. The input has 9 rows, and the output is 4 rows. So maybe each output row corresponds to some combination of the input rows. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first four input rows are:\n\n[0, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0, 4, 0, 4]\n[7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n[7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe output is four rows:\n\n[6, 7, 7, 7]\n[7, 7, 7, 8]\n[8, 0, 8, 4]\n[7, 0, 0, 8]\n\nHmm, not sure how they get these numbers. Maybe each output row is derived from a specific part of the input. Let me check if there's a connection between the middle element (which is 1 in all input rows) and how the other numbers are arranged.\n\nWait, in each input row, the fifth element is always 1. That might be a separator. So maybe the input is divided into quadrants around the center (position 5, since the indexes are 0-8). So perhaps the grid is split into four quadrants (since the output has four elements each time), and each quadrant's elements contribute to one of the output elements.\n\nFor example, the first row of the output might correspond to the top-left quadrant, the second to top-right, third to bottom-left, and fourth to bottom-right. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the first example's output first row [6,7,7,7]. Where does 6 come from? Let me check the input grid. The fifth row is all 1s, so maybe the fifth row and column are the center. So the quadrants are:\n\nTop-left: rows 0-3, columns 0-3 (assuming 0-based index). But the input rows are 9 elements each. Wait, each input is 9x9, but how are they arranged? Wait, maybe each example is a 9x9 grid (since each row has 9 elements and there are 9 rows). So the center is at position (4,4) if we consider 0-based indices. So each quadrant would be:\n\nTop-left: rows 0-3, columns 0-3\nTop-right: rows 0-3, columns 5-8\nBottom-left: rows 5-8, columns 0-3\nBottom-right: rows 5-8, columns 5-8\n\nBut then, the fifth column (index 4) is the middle, which is all 1s. So maybe each quadrant is the 4x4 area in each corner. Then, perhaps the output is combining elements from each quadrant. For example, each output row corresponds to one of these quadrants, and the elements in the output are the maximum value, or the sum, or some pattern.\n\nBut looking at example 0's output first row [6,7,7,7]. Let's check the top-left quadrant (rows 0-3, columns 0-3):\n\nRow 0: [0,7,7,7]\nRow 1: [7,7,7,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0]\nRow 3: [7,0,0,0]\n\nSo this quadrant has numbers 0,7. The output's first element is 6. Hmm, maybe not directly the max. Alternatively, maybe the numbers in each quadrant are being combined in some way. For example, the sum of non-zero elements? Let's see:\n\nIn the top-left quadrant of example 0's input, the numbers are:\n\n0,7,7,7 (row0)\n7,7,7,0 (row1)\n0,0,0,0 (row2)\n7,0,0,0 (row3)\n\nSum of all elements: (0+7+7+7) + (7+7+7+0) + 0 + (7+0+0+0) = 21 + 21 +7 = 49. But output's first element is 6, which doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe counting the number of 7s? In the top-left quadrant of example0, there are 3 +3 +0 +1 =7 7s. But the output is 6 here. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is taking the diagonal elements of each quadrant. For example, the top-left quadrant's diagonal (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3). So in example0's top-left quadrant:\n\nRow0: 0 (col0),7 (col1),7 (col2),7 (col3)\nRow1:7 (col0),7 (col1),7 (col2),0 (col3)\nRow2:0 (col0),0 (col1),0 (col2),0 (col3)\nRow3:7 (col0),0 (col1),0 (col2),0 (col3)\n\nThe diagonal elements would be 0 (0,0),7 (1,1),0 (2,2),0 (3,3). So [0,7,0,0]. But the output's first row is [6,7,7,7]. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is derived from the borders of the quadrants. For example, taking the outermost elements of each quadrant and performing some operation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output elements are taken from the intersections where the quadrants meet. Wait, the output has four elements per row, which is the same as the number of quadrants. So each output row could correspond to one of the quadrants. Let me check the first output row of example0: [6,7,7,7]. Maybe each element is the sum of a certain part of the quadrant.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the output rows are the four corners of the entire grid. For example, in a 9x9 grid, the four corners are (0,0), (0,8), (8,0), (8,8). But the outputs are 4 elements per row. Wait, in example0's output, the first row is [6,7,7,7]. But the input's (0,0) is 0, (0,8) is 4, (8,0) is 0, (8,8) is 0. So that doesn't align.\n\nWait, maybe each output row is derived from a specific row in the input. For example, in example0's input, rows 0-3 are the top, row4 is middle, rows5-8 are bottom. The output has 4 rows, perhaps each corresponding to the four quadrants. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by looking at the rows above and below the middle row (row4). For example, the first four rows (rows0-3) are upper half, and rows5-8 are lower half. Maybe each output row is a combination of elements from these.\n\nWait, looking at the output rows for example0:\n\n[6,7,7,7]\n[7,7,7,8]\n[8,0,8,4]\n[7,0,0,8]\n\nLooking at the input for example0, perhaps the first two output rows are from the upper half (rows0-3) and the next two from the lower half (rows5-8). Let's check:\n\nFirst output row: [6,7,7,7]. Where does 6 come from in the upper half? There's no 6 in the upper half of example0's input. The lower half (rows5-8) has 6s. Wait, but the output's third row is [8,0,8,4], which includes 8s and 4, which are present in the lower half. So maybe the output rows are combining elements from upper and lower halves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is the diagonal of each quadrant. Let's take the top-left quadrant (rows0-3, cols0-3). The diagonal elements would be (0,0)=0, (1,1)=7, (2,2)=0, (3,3)=0. Summing those gives 7, but the output's first element is 6. Doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the maximum value from each quadrant. For example0's top-left quadrant has max 7. But the first output element is 6. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at the positions in the input where the numbers are non-zero and not 1. Let's see in example0's input:\n\nRow0: 0,7,7,7,1,0,4,0,4 \u2192 non-1 values: 7,7,7,4,0,4. The output's first row starts with 6. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: The output has four rows, each with four elements. Maybe each element in the output corresponds to a specific cell in the input grid, possibly in the vicinity of the center. For example, maybe the four elements in each output row are the four cells adjacent to the center (position4,4). But in the input, the center is all 1s. So the adjacent cells would be positions (3,4), (4,3), (4,5), (5,4). But in example0's output, the first row is [6,7,7,7]. Not sure how these numbers relate to those positions.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the first four rows of the input and the last four rows, and for each, taking certain columns. For example, the output rows could be combining elements from the first four rows and certain columns. Let me check example0's first output row [6,7,7,7]. Looking for a 6 in the input. The input's row5 is [0,0,0,0,1,6,6,6,0]. So the first four elements are 0,0,0,0, but the sixth element is 6. Hmm, maybe columns 5-8. For example, the first output row could be taking the sixth elements from rows0-3. Let's check:\n\nIn example0's input rows0-3, column5 (index5) are 0,4,0,0. So [0,4,0,0]. Not matching [6,7,7,7].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are formed by taking the non-zero numbers from each quadrant. For example, the top-left quadrant's non-zero numbers are 7s and a 7 in row3. So maybe count them or sum, but how that would get 6?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are connected to the positions where they appear in the quadrants. For example, in the top-left quadrant, the maximum number is 7, and in the output, the first element is 6. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by looking at the numbers in the rows adjacent to the center row. For example, row4 is the center. So rows 0-3 are above, 5-8 below. Perhaps each output row is formed by taking elements from these rows. For example, the first output row might be from row3 and row5. Let's check example0's output first row [6,7,7,7]. Row3 in input is [7,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], and row5 is [0,0,0,0,1,6,6,6,0]. Maybe combining elements from these. But where would 6 come from? Row5 has 6s starting at index5. So if the output's first element is 6, maybe it's taking the first 6 from row5. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking elements from the perimeter of each quadrant. For example, the top-left quadrant's perimeter includes the first and last rows and columns of that quadrant. Let's see:\n\nTop-left quadrant (rows0-3, cols0-3):\n\nPerimeter elements would be:\n\nRow0, cols0-3: 0,7,7,7\nRow3, cols0-3:7,0,0,0\nCol0, rows0-3:0,7,0,7\nCol3, rows0-3:7,0,0,0\n\nBut how does that lead to the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of certain elements in each quadrant. For example, the sum of the first and last elements of each row in the quadrant.\n\nBut in example0's top-left quadrant rows0-3:\n\nRow0: 0 and 7 (first and last of quadrant row)\nRow1:7 and 0\nRow2:0 and 0\nRow3:7 and 0\nSum: (0+7) + (7+0) + (0+0) + (7+0) =7 +7 +0 +7=21. 21 is not 6. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output rows are the four corners of each quadrant. For example, for the top-left quadrant, the corners are (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3). These are 0,7,7,0. Summing these gives 14, which is not 6. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, looking for some pattern where the output elements are derived from the positions in the input where a certain number is present. For example, in example0's output first row, 6 is present. Where is 6 in the input? Only in row5: [0,0,0,0,1,6,6,6,0]. So the first occurrence of 6 is in row5, column5. Maybe the output elements are the first occurrence of certain numbers in each quadrant.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the first element from each quadrant that is not 0 or 1. Let's check:\n\nFor example0's first output row [6,7,7,7]. If each element corresponds to a quadrant:\n\n- Top-left: first non-zero is 0 in (0,0), then 7 in (0,1). But the output starts with 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the maximum value from each quadrant in the lower half and upper half. But example0's first output element is 6, which is from the lower half's quadrant.\n\nWait, maybe each output row corresponds to a ring around the center. Since the grid is 9x9, the center is at (4,4). The first ring around it would be the adjacent cells, then next ring, etc. But the output has four elements per row. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the outputs across examples. For example, in example0's output:\n\nFirst row: [6,7,7,7]\n\nIn example1's output:\n\nFirst row: [7,7,7,6]\n\nExample2's first row: [0,4,7,7]\n\nHmm, maybe the first element of each output row corresponds to a specific position. Let's check example0's first output row starts with 6. Where is 6 in the input? Only in row5, column5. So maybe the first element of the first output row is the value at (5,5), then (5,3), etc. But in example0's input, row5 is [0,0,0,0,1,6,6,6,0], so (5,5) is 6. Then the next elements could be from other positions.\n\nWait, maybe the output rows are formed by taking the values from positions (4\u00b11, 4\u00b11), like a cross around the center. The center is (4,4). The adjacent cells would be (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5). But those in example0's input are:\n\n(3,4): row3, column4 is 1 (but all rows have 1 in column4). So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the numbers in the output for example0, the numbers are 6,7,8,4. These are all present in the input. 6 is in row5,7 is in rows0-3,8 is in rows6-8,4 is in rows0-2. Maybe each output row is combining elements from different quadrants.\n\nWait, considering that the output has four elements per row, perhaps each element corresponds to one of the four quadrants. For example, the first output row's elements are from the four quadrants' specific positions. Let's try example0's first output row:\n\n6,7,7,7.\n\nIf each element is from a different quadrant:\n\n- 6: lower quadrants (since 6 is in row5, column5)\n- 7s: upper quadrants.\n\nBut how to map this.\n\nAlternatively, the four elements in each output row correspond to the four corners of the entire grid. For example, the first output row's elements could be from (0,0), (0,8), (8,0), (8,8). But in example0, those values are 0,4,0,0. Doesn't match the first output row.\n\nAnother idea: The output rows might be the diagonals of each quadrant. For example, the main diagonal of each quadrant. For the top-left quadrant, the diagonal is elements (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3). For example0, these are 0,7,0,0. Summing them gives 7. Not matching 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element is the count of a certain number in each quadrant. For example, the first element could be the count of 6s in a quadrant, but in example0's top-left quadrant, there are no 6s. So the first element would be 0, which it's not. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by reading numbers from the input in a specific spiral or other pattern. For example, starting from a corner and moving around the grid. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother approach: Compare input and output across multiple examples to find a pattern. Let's look at example0's input and output.\n\nInput rows0-3 (upper half):\n\nRow0: 0,7,7,7,1,0,4,0,4\n\nRow1:7,7,7,0,1,4,4,0,0\n\nRow2:0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4\n\nRow3:7,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[6,7,7,7]\n\n[7,7,7,8]\n\n[8,0,8,4]\n\n[7,0,0,8]\n\nLooking for how 6 is derived. In the input, 6 appears in row5, column5:6. The output's first element is 6. So perhaps the first element of the first output row is row5, column5. Let's check:\n\nRow5, column5: example0's row5 is [0,0,0,0,1,6,6,6,0]. So column5 is 6. So the first element is 6. Then the next elements could be row0, column0 (0), row0, column8 (4), etc. But in the first output row of example0, it's [6,7,7,7]. So the first element is 6 (row5, column5), the next three are 7s. Where are those 7s? For example, row0 has 7s in columns1-3. So maybe column5, then columns1-3 of row0. But why those?\n\nAlternatively, the first output row could be row5's elements 5-8:6,6,6,0. But output is [6,7,7,7]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother possibility: The output rows are the diagonal of the entire grid. But the diagonal of a 9x9 grid would have 9 elements, not 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row corresponds to a specific direction from the center. For example, up, right, down, left. And each element in the row is the first non-zero number encountered in that direction from the center.\n\nLet's test this idea with example0. The center is at (4,4). Looking in each direction:\n\nUp: from (4,4) moving up to row0, column4. The elements are row4's column4 is 1 (center). Moving up, row3's column4 is 1, row2's column4 is 1, etc. All rows have 1 in column4. So this doesn't explain the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe directions in the quadrants. For example, from the center, moving into each quadrant and taking the first non-zero number. For example, in the top-left quadrant, moving from center (4,4) to the top-left corner, the first non-zero would be row3, column3 (0), row3, column0 (7). Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output rows are formed by taking the non-zero elements from the four corners of each quadrant. For example, each quadrant has four corners. Let's see:\n\nFor the top-left quadrant (rows0-3, cols0-3), the corners are (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3). The values are 0,7,7,0. Maybe taking the sum or some combination. But example0's first output row starts with 6. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are the four elements surrounding the center. The center is (4,4). The four adjacent cells are (3,4), (4,5), (5,4), (4,3). But all those are 1s, which is the center. Wait, no. Wait, each row in the input has a 1 in the fifth position (index4). So rows0-8 all have 1 at index4. So the cells around the center would be (3,4) (row3, col4) is 1, (4,3) is 1, etc. So they're all 1s, which might not be useful.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at how the output elements relate to the input's upper and lower halves. For example, the first two output rows may come from the upper half (rows0-3) and the last two from the lower half (rows5-8).\n\nExample0's output:\n\n[6,7,7,7] \u2192 possibly from lower half, since 6 is there.\n\n[7,7,7,8] \u2192 from upper half.\n\n[8,0,8,4] \u2192 lower half.\n\n[7,0,0,8] \u2192 lower half.\n\nBut this is unclear.\n\nWait, let's look at example0's output first row: [6,7,7,7]. The only 6 in the input is in row5. So perhaps the first element of each output row is from row5, column5. Then the rest of the elements are from other positions. Let's check:\n\nRow5, column5:6.\n\nThen the other elements:7,7,7. Looking for 7s in the input. The upper part has 7s in rows0,1,3. Maybe the next three elements are from rows0,1,3, column0.\n\nRow0, column0:0.\n\nRow1, column0:7.\n\nRow3, column0:7.\n\nBut output's first row is [6,7,7,7]. So perhaps the elements after 6 are 7s from somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is [6 (row5,5), 7 (row0,1),7 (row0,2),7 (row0,3)]. That would match the first output row of example0. Let's check:\n\nRow5, column5:6.\n\nRow0, columns1-3:7,7,7. So yes, the first output row is [6,7,7,7]. That fits.\n\nSimilarly, the second output row in example0 is [7,7,7,8]. Let's check:\n\nRow5, column5 is 6, but the second output row is part of the output. Maybe each output row corresponds to a different row in the input's lower half. Wait, example0's output has four rows, and the lower half has four rows (rows5-8). Maybe each output row is built from one row in the lower half. For example, output row1 is derived from row6 of the input.\n\nExample0's row6: [0,0,8,8,1,0,0,0,0]. So columns5-8 are 0,0,0,0. Not sure how that would lead to [7,7,7,8].\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is built from a combination of elements from the corresponding row in the upper and lower halves.\n\nFor example, output row0 is derived from row0 (upper) and row5 (lower).\n\nIn example0:\n\nrow0: [0,7,7,7,1,0,4,0,4]\n\nrow5: [0,0,0,0,1,6,6,6,0]\n\nIf output row0 is formed by taking elements from these two rows. For example, elements from row5's columns5-8 (6,6,6,0) and row0's columns1-3 (7,7,7). But how they combine to [6,7,7,7].\n\nAh! Maybe the first element of each output row comes from the lower half's corresponding row's column5, and the next three elements come from the upper half's corresponding row's columns1-3.\n\nFor example, output row0:\n\n- First element: lower half row5 (since output row0 is first, maybe lower row5) column5:6.\n\n- Next three elements: upper half row0 columns1-3:7,7,7.\n\nSo the output row0 would be [6,7,7,7], which matches example0.\n\nThen, output row1 would be:\n\n- First element: lower row6 column5:0.\n\nBut example0's output row1 is [7,7,7,8]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Because row6's column5 is 0. But example0's output row1's first element is7.\n\nWait, perhaps the first element is from lower row's column5, but the index shifts. Let's see:\n\nExample0's output has four rows. So output rows 0-3 correspond to lower rows5-8.\n\nWait, lower half has four rows: rows5,6,7,8. Maybe each output row is built as follows:\n\nFor output row0 (lower row5):\n\nFirst element: row5's column5 (6).\n\nNext three elements: upper row0's columns1-3 (7,7,7). So output row0: [6,7,7,7], which matches.\n\nOutput row1 (lower row6):\n\nFirst element: row6's column5 (0).\n\nNext three elements: upper row1's columns1-3 (7,7,0). But example0's output row1 is [7,7,7,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, perhaps the next three elements are from upper row's columns5-8. For example, upper row0's columns5-8 are [0,4,0,4], but output row0 has 7,7,7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the next three elements are from the lower row's columns6-8. For example, row5's columns6-8 are6,6,0. So output row0 would be [6,6,6,0], which doesn't match.\n\nThis approach doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother idea: The first element of each output row is from the lower half's column5 of the corresponding row, and the rest are from the upper half's columns1-3 of the same row index. For example, output row0 (index0):\n\nLower row5, column5:6.\n\nUpper row0, columns1-3:7,7,7. So output row0 is [6,7,7,7], which matches.\n\nOutput row1 (index1):\n\nLower row6, column5:0.\n\nUpper row1, columns1-3:7,7,7. So output row1 would be [0,7,7,7]. But example0's output row1 is [7,7,7,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nSo that doesn't work. But in example0's output row1, the first element is7, which is present in upper row1's columns1-3. So maybe it's the other way around: first element from upper row's columns1-3, and the rest from lower row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first element is the lower row's column5, and the rest are the upper row's columns1-3. But in example0's row1 (upper) columns1-3 are7,7,0. But output row1 starts with7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are created by combining the lower half's column5 with the upper half's columns1-3. For example, output row0: [6 (row5,5), 7 (row0,1),7 (row0,2),7 (row0,3)] \u2192 [6,7,7,7], which matches.\n\nThen output row1 would be [row6,5, row1,1, row1,2, row1,3]. Row6,5: row6 is [0,0,8,8,1,0,0,0,0], so column5 is0. Row1,1-3:7,7,0. So output row1 would be [0,7,7,0], but example0's output row1 is [7,7,7,8]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output rows are formed differently. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example0's output:\n\n[6,7,7,7]\n\n[7,7,7,8]\n\n[8,0,8,4]\n\n[7,0,0,8]\n\nLooking at the last elements of each row:7,8,4,8. Where do these numbers come from? 8 is present in the lower half (rows6-8). 4 is in the upper half (rows0-3).\n\nFor example, the last element of the first row is7 (upper row0, column3). The second row's last element is8 (row6, column3 is8). Third row's last element is4 (row0, column8 is4). Fourth row's last element is8 (row8, column3 is0, but row6, column3 is8). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the last element of each output row is the same as the first element of the next output row. For example, example0's first row ends with7, second row starts with7. Second row ends with8, third starts with8. Third ends with4, fourth starts with7. Doesn't hold.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at how the numbers in the output are ordered. For example0's first output row is6,7,7,7. The6 is from row5, column5. The7s are from row0's columns1-3. Maybe the output row is combining the lower row's column5 and the upper row's columns1-3.\n\nSimilarly, in example1's input:\n\nOutput row0: [7,7,7,6]. The7s are from upper row0's columns1-3 (7,7,7). The6 is from lower row5's column5 (6). So the output row is [7,7,7,6], which is the reverse of example0's first row. So perhaps the first three elements are from upper row's columns1-3, and the fourth element from lower row's column5.\n\nIn example0's output row0: [6,7,7,7]. If it's reversed, it would be7,7,7,6. But the first element is6. So maybe the order depends on the quadrant. \n\nAlternatively, the output row is constructed as follows:\n\nFor each output row (0-3):\n\n- Take the lower half row (rows5-8) corresponding to the output row index. For example, row0 of output corresponds to row5 of lower half.\n\n- Take column5 of that row (6 in example0 row5).\n\n- Then take columns1-3 of the upper half's row (same index as output row). For example, upper row0's columns1-3 are7,7,7.\n\nSo output row0 would be [6,7,7,7].\n\nOutput row1 would be:\n\nLower row6, column5:0 (from example0's row6: [0,0,8,8,1,0,0,0,0], column5 is0).\n\nUpper row1's columns1-3:7,7,0 (from example0's row1: [7,7,7,0,1,4,4,0,0]).\n\nSo output row1 would be [0,7,7,0], but example0's actual output row1 is [7,7,7,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. But in example0's output row1, the first element is7. Where is7 in row6 of the lower half? Row6 has 8s in columns2-3, but not7. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output rows are formed by taking the lower half's column5 and the upper half's columns1-3, but in reverse order. For example, output row0 is [6,7,7,7] as before. Output row1 could be lower row6's column5 (0) and upper row1's columns1-3 (7,7,7), but then how does the 8 come in.\n\nWait, example0's output row1 is [7,7,7,8]. The last element is8. Where is8 in the input? In row6, columns2-3 (8,8). So maybe the last element is the first occurrence of8 in the lower row. For row6, it's at column2. So 8 is added as the last element.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example3's output:\n\n[7,7,8,4]\n\n[7,6,7,0]\n\n[7,4,4,7]\n\n[7,8,7,7]\n\nThe first row's elements are 7,7,8,4. Looking at the input for example3, which has rows5-8:\n\nRow5: [0,0,8,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,8,0,1,6,6,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,8,0,1,0,6,6,6]\n\nRow8: [0,8,0,8,1,0,6,6,0]\n\nLower rows:\n\nrow5: column5 is0.\n\nrow6: column5 is6.\n\nrow7: column5 is0.\n\nrow8: column5 is0.\n\nBut the first output row's first element is7. So it's not from column5 of the lower rows.\n\nWait, perhaps the output rows are constructed from the upper half's columns5-8 and the lower half's columns5-8. For example, each output row combines two elements from upper and two from lower.\n\nBut example0's output row0 has four elements, which would need to come from four positions. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the output as a 4x4 grid. Each output element is somehow derived from a 2x2 section of the input grid. For example, each output element is the sum or product of a 2x2 block in the input.\n\nBut example0's output first element is6. Let's find a 2x2 block in the input that sums to6. For example, row5, columns5-6:6,6. Sum is12. Not 6. Or perhaps the product. 6*6=36. No.\n\nAlternatively, the count of a certain number in a 2x2 block. For example, if there are two 3s, but I don't see 3s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum value in a 2x2 block. For example, the block at row5, columns5-6:6,6. Max is6. So output first element is6. Then, the next block could be row0, columns1-2:7,7. Max is7. So output elements would be6,7,7,7. Which matches example0's first row. So this might be the pattern!\n\nLet me test this hypothesis.\n\nExample0's output first row:6,7,7,7.\n\nEach element is the maximum of a 2x2 block in the input.\n\nWhere are these blocks located?\n\nFor example, the first element6: block in lower half, perhaps row5-6, column5-6. The values are6,6 and0,0. Max is6.\n\nSecond element7: block in upper half, row0-1, column1-2. Values are7,7 and7,7. Max is7.\n\nThird element7: upper row0-1, column2-3. Values7,7 and7,0. Max7.\n\nFourth element7: upper row0-1, column3-4. But column4 is1. So maybe different blocks.\n\nAlternatively, the blocks are arranged in the four quadrants. Each quadrant is divided into 2x2 blocks, and the max of each is taken.\n\nFor example, the input is divided into four quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). Each quadrant is 4x4 (since the grid is 9x9, but the center is row4 and column4, so each quadrant is 4x4: rows0-3, cols0-3; rows0-3, cols5-8; rows5-8, cols0-3; rows5-8, cols5-8).\n\nEach quadrant is then divided into four 2x2 blocks. The output's four elements are the max of each of these 2x2 blocks.\n\nLet me check this.\n\nExample0's top-left quadrant is 4x4:\n\nRow0: [0,7,7,7]\n\nRow1: [7,7,7,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [7,0,0,0]\n\nDivided into four 2x2 blocks:\n\nBlock1 (0-1,0-1):\n\n0,7\n\n7,7 \u2192 max is7.\n\nBlock2 (0-1,2-3):\n\n7,7\n\n7,0 \u2192 max7.\n\nBlock3 (2-3,0-1):\n\n0,0\n\n7,0 \u2192 max7.\n\nBlock4 (2-3,2-3):\n\n0,0\n\n0,0 \u2192 max0.\n\nSo if the output for top-left quadrant is [7,7,7,0], but example0's output first row is [6,7,7,7]. Doesn't match.\n\nBut the first output row of example0 is [6,7,7,7]. So maybe this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row corresponds to one quadrant, and each element is the max of a 2x2 block in that quadrant.\n\nFor example, output row0 is the top-left quadrant's four 2x2 blocks' maxes. But example0's top-left quadrant's maxes would be7,7,7,0. So the output row0 would be [7,7,7,0], but it's [6,7,7,7]. So not matching.\n\nAnother Idea: The output is the result of rotating or reflecting parts of the input. For example, taking the upper-left quadrant and rotating it, then taking specific elements.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Perhaps I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at example0's output, each row has four elements. The numbers in the output are present in the input. For instance, the first output row of example0 is [6,7,7,7], which are found in row5 (6s) and row0 (7s). \n\nAnother possibility: The output is formed by taking the first occurrence of each number in a specific order. For example, the first four unique numbers encountered in a spiral around the grid. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the diagonal of a certain section. For example, the diagonal of the lower half's quadrant.\n\nExample0's lower half (rows5-8, cols5-8):\n\nRow5:6,6,6,0\n\nRow6:0,0,0,0\n\nRow7:0,0,6,0\n\nRow8:0,0,0,0\n\nThe diagonal of this quadrant (cols5-8) would be6 (row5,5), 0 (row6,6),6 (row7,7),0 (row8,8). So [6,0,6,0]. But example0's output third row is [7,0,0,8], which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal of the lower half's quadrant (rows5-8, cols0-3):\n\nRow5:0,0,0,0\n\nRow6:0,0,8,8\n\nRow7:8,0,8,0\n\nRow8:0,0,0,8\n\nDiagonal elements:0 (5,0),0 (6,1),8 (7,2),8 (8,3). So [0,0,8,8]. But example0's third output row is [8,0,8,4]. The first element is8, which is from row7,2. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example3's input:\n\nInput rows0-3 (upper half):\n\nRow0:7,7,0,0,1,4,4,0,4\n\nRow1:7,0,7,0,1,4,0,0,0\n\nRow2:7,0,0,7,1,4,4,4,0\n\nRow3:7,0,7,7,1,4,0,4,4\n\nOutput rows:\n\n[7,7,8,4]\n\n[7,6,7,0]\n\n[7,4,4,7]\n\n[7,8,7,7]\n\nLooking at the first output row:7,7,8,4. Where are these numbers in the input?\n\n7s are in upper rows. 8 is in row5:0,0,8,0. 4 is in upper rows.\n\nRow5 of the input is [0,0,8,0,1,0,0,0,0]. So column2 is8. So perhaps the first element is from row0's column0 (7), second from row0's column1 (7), third from row5's column2 (8), fourth from row0's column5 (4). So output row0:7,7,8,4. That matches. Let's check:\n\nRow0, column0:7.\n\nRow0, column1:7.\n\nRow5, column2:8.\n\nRow0, column5:4.\n\nYes! So the first output row is formed by [row0,0], [row0,1], [row5,2], [row0,5].\n\nThen, the second output row would be [row1,0], [row1,1], [row6,2], [row1,5].\n\nRow1,0:7.\n\nRow1,1:0.\n\nRow6,2:8.\n\nRow1,5:4.\n\nSo the second output row would be [7,0,8,4]. But example3's second output row is [7,6,7,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, this doesn't fit. But example3's output row1 is [7,6,7,0]. Where do these numbers come from?\n\n7 could be row1,0:7.\n\n6 is in row6,5:6.\n\n7 could be row6, something else? Row6 is [0,0,8,0,1,6,6,0,0]. So row6,5:6. row6,2:8. row6,6:6. \n\nSo maybe the output elements are taken from specific columns in upper and lower rows. For example:\n\nOutput row0:\n\nupper row0, columns0,1,2,5 \u2192 7,7,0,4 \u2192 but output is7,7,8,4. So the third element is8 from lower row5, column2.\n\nSo it's combining upper row0's columns0,1 with lower row5's columns2,5.\n\nBut how to decide which columns to pick.\n\nAlternatively, for each output row, the first two elements come from the upper row's first two columns, and the last two from the lower row's certain columns.\n\nBut this is getting too arbitrary.\n\nAnother Idea: The output rows are formed by taking the first four non-zero elements from each quadrant, in a specific order.\n\nFor example, in example0's top-left quadrant:\n\nNon-zero elements:7s and one7 in row3.\n\nFirst four non-zero elements are7,7,7,7 (from row0 and row1).\n\nBut the first output row starts with6. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements are the four non-zero elements from the lower half's column5 and the upper half's columns1-3. But in example0's first output row, the6 is from lower row5, column5, and the7s from upper row0's columns1-3.\n\nThis seems to fit for example0's first output row. Let's check example1's first output row: [7,7,7,6].\n\nIn example1's input, upper row0's columns1-3:7,7,7. Lower row5's column5:6. So the first output row would be [7,7,7,6], which matches. So this seems to be the pattern!\n\nSimilarly, example0's output row1 would be [7,7,7,8]. So upper row1's columns1-3:7,7,7. Lower row6's column5:0. But in example0's output row1, the last element is8. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, example0's output row1 is [7,7,7,8]. The first three elements are7,7,7 (from upper row1's columns1-3:7,7,7). The fourth element is8, which is from lower row6's column5:0. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this pattern works for the first output row of examples0 and1, but not for others.\n\nAlternative Idea: The output is constructed by taking the first element from the lower row's column5, then the next three from the upper row's columns1-3. But in example0's output row0, this works. For example1's output row0, lower row5's column5 is6, upper row0's columns1-3 are7,7,7. So output row0 would be [6,7,7,7], but example1's output row0 is [7,7,7,6]. So the order is reversed.\n\nAh! Maybe the output row is formed by taking upper row's columns1-3 followed by the lower row's column5. For example:\n\nFor example0's row0:\n\nupper row0's columns1-3:7,7,7 \u2192 [7,7,7]\n\nlower row5's column5:6 \u2192 append to get [7,7,7,6]. But example0's output row0 is [6,7,7,7]. So this doesn't match. But example1's output row0 is [7,7,7,6], which would fit.\n\nThis suggests that the output row is constructed by appending the lower row's column5 to the upper row's columns1-3. \n\nExample1's output row0 is [7,7,7,6], which is upper row0's columns1-3 (7,7,7) plus lower row5's column5 (6). This works.\n\nExample0's output row0 is [6,7,7,7], which would require appending lower row5's column5 (6) to upper row0's columns1-3 (7,7,7) but in reverse order. But that would require [6,7,7,7], which matches. So perhaps the first element is lower row's column5, then upper row's columns1-3.\n\nSo the pattern for each output row is:\n\noutput_row[i] = [lower_row[i+5][5]] + upper_row[i][1:4]\n\nWhere i ranges from 0 to3.\n\nLet's check this:\n\nFor example0's output row0:\n\ni=0.\n\nlower_row is row5: [0,0,0,0,1,6,6,6,0]. column5 is6.\n\nupper_row is row0: [0,7,7,7,1,0,4,0,4]. columns1-3 are7,7,7.\n\nSo output row0 is [6,7,7,7]. Correct.\n\nExample0's output row1 (i=1):\n\nlower_row is row6: [0,0,8,8,1,0,0,0,0]. column5 is0.\n\nupper_row is row1: [7,7,7,0,1,4,4,0,0]. columns1-3 are7,7,0.\n\nSo output row1 should be [0,7,7,0]. But example0's output row1 is [7,7,7,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. So this works for row0 but not row1.\n\nWait, example0's output row1 is [7,7,7,8]. So according to this pattern, the first element would be row6's column5 (0), but the output's first element is7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe there's a different pattern. Perhaps the output rows are formed by taking the upper row's columns1-3 and the lower row's column5, but for different rows. For example, output row0 is upper row0's columns1-3 plus lower row5's column5. Output row1 is upper row1's columns1-3 plus lower row6's column5. Output row2 is upper row2's columns1-3 plus lower row7's column5. Output row3 is upper row3's columns1-3 plus lower row8's column5.\n\nLet's check example0's output row1:\n\nupper row1's columns1-3:7,7,7.\n\nlower row6's column5:0.\n\nSo output row1 should be [7,7,7,0], but example0's output row1 is [7,7,7,8]. So the last element is8, which is from row6's column3 (8). So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut example0's output row1's last element is8. Where is8 in the lower half? In row6, column2 and3:8,8. So maybe instead of column5, it's taking column2 or3.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe for each output row, the first three elements are the upper row's columns1-3, and the fourth element is the lower row's column3.\n\nFor example0's output row0:\n\nupper row0's columns1-3:7,7,7.\n\nlower row5's column3:0.\n\nSo output row0 would be [7,7,7,0], but example0's output row0 is [6,7,7,7]. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time I have, I'll try to proceed with the pattern where each output row is formed by taking the lower row's column5 and the upper row's columns1-3, even though it doesn't fit all examples, but see if it works for the test case.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[7,7,7,0,1,0,0,4,0]\n\n[0,7,7,0,1,4,4,0,4]\n\n[7,7,7,7,1,0,4,0,4]\n\n[7,0,0,0,1,4,0,4,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[0,0,0,8,1,0,6,0,6]\n\n[8,0,0,8,1,6,0,0,6]\n\n[8,0,8,0,1,6,6,6,6]\n\n[0,8,0,8,1,0,6,0,0]\n\nThe output should have four rows. According to the pattern where each row is formed by taking lower row's column5 and upper row's columns1-3:\n\nOutput row0: lower row5 (index5) column5:0. upper row0 (index0) columns1-3:7,7,0. So output row0: [0,7,7,0]. But looking at the training examples, this approach doesn't fit all, but maybe there's a variation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first element is the lower row's column5, and the next three are the upper row's columns5-8. For example0's output row0: lower row5's column5 is6, upper row0's columns5-8:0,4,0,4. So output row0 would be [6,0,4,0], which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first element is the lower row's column5, and the next three are the lower row's columns6-8.\n\nFor example0's row5: columns5-8 are6,6,6,0. So output row0 would be [6,6,6,0], but example0's output row0 is [6,7,7,7]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: The output rows are the columns of the upper and lower quadrants. For example, each output row is a column from the upper quadrant and a column from the lower quadrant.\n\nBut without more time to analyze, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the pattern where each output row combines elements from the upper and lower rows. \n\nFor the test input, let's try to apply the pattern where each output row is constructed by taking the lower row's column5 and the upper row's columns1-3. \n\nTest input's lower rows are rows5-8:\n\nrow5: [0,0,0,8,1,0,6,0,6] \u2192 column5 is0.\n\nrow6: [8,0,0,8,1,6,0,0,6] \u2192 column5 is6.\n\nrow7: [8,0,8,0,1,6,6,6,6] \u2192 column5 is6.\n\nrow8: [0,8,0,8,1,0,6,0,0] \u2192 column5 is0.\n\nUpper rows0-3:\n\nrow0: [7,7,7,0,1,0,0,4,0] \u2192 columns1-3:7,7,0.\n\nrow1: [0,7,7,0,1,4,4,0,4] \u2192 columns1-3:7,7,0.\n\nrow2: [7,7,7,7,1,0,4,0,4] \u2192 columns1-3:7,7,7.\n\nrow3: [7,0,0,0,1,4,0,4,0] \u2192 columns1-3:0,0,0.\n\nSo output rows would be:\n\nrow0: lower row5's column5 (0) + upper row0's columns1-3 (7,7,0) \u2192 [0,7,7,0].\n\nrow1: lower row6's column5 (6) + upper row1's columns1-3 (7,7,0) \u2192 [6,7,7,0].\n\nrow2: lower row7's column5 (6) + upper row2's columns1-3 (7,7,7) \u2192 [6,7,7,7].\n\nrow3: lower row8's column5 (0) + upper row3's columns1-3 (0,0,0) \u2192 [0,0,0,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs don't have zeros in this way. For example, example0's output row0 is [6,7,7,7], which fits if we take lower row5's column5 (6) and upper row0's columns1-3 (7,7,7). Wait, in the test input's upper row0's columns1-3 are7,7,0. So perhaps the pattern is taking the upper row's columns1-3 and the lower row's column5, but in reverse order. For example, the output row is upper columns1-3 followed by lower column5.\n\nSo test output row0 would be [7,7,0,0]. But example0's output row0 is [6,7,7,7], which would be lower column5 (6) followed by upper columns1-3 (7,7,7). So for test input, row0 would be [0,7,7,0], which doesn't align with training examples.\n\nThis is getting too uncertain. Given the time constraints, I'll make a guess based on the pattern where each output row is formed by taking the lower row's column5 and the upper row's columns1-3, even though it doesn't fit all examples. But given the test input, let's see:\n\nLower rows5-8, column5:\n\nrow5:0\n\nrow6:6\n\nrow7:6\n\nrow8:0\n\nUpper rows0-3, columns1-3:\n\nrow0:7,7,0\n\nrow1:7,7,0\n\nrow2:7,7,7\n\nrow3:0,0,0\n\nSo output rows would be:\n\nrow0:0 followed by7,7,0 \u2192 [0,7,7,0]\n\nrow1:6 followed by7,7,0 \u2192 [6,7,7,0]\n\nrow2:6 followed by7,7,7 \u2192 [6,7,7,7]\n\nrow3:0 followed by0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't match. For example, example0's output row1 is [7,7,7,8], which would not fit this pattern. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by combining upper row's columns1-3 and lower row's columns6-8. Let's try:\n\nFor test input's row5: columns6-8:6,0,6 \u21926,0,6.\n\nUpper row0's columns1-3:7,7,0.\n\nSo output row0 would be7,7,0,6,0,6. But output rows have four elements. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the output rows are the four elements from the lower rows' columns5 and the upper rows' columns1,2,3.\n\nFor example, output row0: lower row5's column5 (0), upper row0's columns1 (7), 2 (7),3 (0). So [0,7,7,0]. But example0's output row0 is [6,7,7,7]. This doesn't match.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll look for a different pattern. Maybe the output rows are the first four non-zero elements from each quadrant in the input.\n\nTest input's upper-left quadrant (rows0-3, cols0-3):\n\nrow0:7,7,7,0\n\nrow1:0,7,7,0\n\nrow2:7,7,7,7\n\nrow3:7,0,0,0\n\nNon-zero elements:7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7. The first four are7s. So output row0 would be7,7,7,7.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't align. For example, example0's first output row is [6,7,7,7], which doesn't fit this.\n\nAfter struggling for a while, I think the correct pattern is that each output row is formed by taking the first element from the lower row's column5 and the next three elements from the upper row's columns1-3. Even though it doesn't fit all training examples, maybe there's a variation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are the four elements from the upper rows' columns1-3 and the lower rows' column5, but in reverse order. For example, output row0 is [7,7,7,6] for example0. But example0's row0's output is [6,7,7,7]. So maybe the first element is the lower row's column5, followed by upper row's columns1-3.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nLower rows5-8 column5: row5=0, row6=6, row7=6, row8=0.\n\nUpper rows0-3 columns1-3:\n\nrow0:7,7,0\n\nrow1:7,7,0\n\nrow2:7,7,7\n\nrow3:0,0,0\n\nSo output rows would be:\n\nrow0:0,7,7,0 \u2192 [0,7,7,0]\n\nrow1:6,7,7,0 \u2192 [6,7,7,0]\n\nrow2:6,7,7,7 \u2192 [6,7,7,7]\n\nrow3:0,0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this doesn't fit. For instance, example3's output row0 is [7,7,8,4], which doesn't match this pattern.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without a clear pattern, I'll make an educated guess that the output rows are formed by taking the lower row's column5 and the upper row's columns1-3, but perhaps with some rotation or ordering.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking the upper row's columns5-8 and the lower row's columns1-3. \n\nFor example, example0's output row0:\n\nupper row0's columns5-8:0,4,0,4.\n\nlower row5's columns1-3:0,0,0.\n\nBut output row0 is [6,7,7,7]. Doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed to take a different approach by looking for patterns in the test input and comparing to training examples.\n\nLooking at the test input's lower half:\n\nrow5: [0,0,0,8,1,0,6,0,6] \u2192 columns5:0.\n\nrow6: [8,0,0,8,1,6,0,0,6] \u2192 columns5:6.\n\nrow7: [8,0,8,0,1,6,6,6,6] \u2192 columns5:6.\n\nrow8: [0,8,0,8,1,0,6,0,0] \u2192 columns5:0.\n\nThe upper rows0-3:\n\nrow0: [7,7,7,0,1,0,0,4,0] \u2192 columns1-3:7,7,0.\n\nrow1: [0,7,7,0,1,4,4,0,4] \u2192 columns1-3:7,7,0.\n\nrow2: [7,7,7,7,1,0,4,0,4] \u2192 columns1-3:7,7,7.\n\nrow3: [7,0,0,0,1,4,0,4,0] \u2192 columns1-3:0,0,0.\n\nIf we follow the pattern where each output row is upper row's columns1-3 followed by lower row's column5:\n\nrow0:7,7,0,0 \u2192 [7,7,0,0]\n\nrow1:7,7,0,6 \u2192 [7,7,0,6]\n\nrow2:7,7,7,6 \u2192 [7,7,7,6]\n\nrow3:0,0,0,0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at training examples, example0's output row0 is [6,7,7,7], which would require lower column5 (6) followed by upper columns1-3 (7,7,7).\n\nSo for the test input, output row0 would be [0,7,7,0], row1: [6,7,7,0], row2: [6,7,7,7], row3: [0,0,0,0]. But this doesn't seem to fit any training example structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the lower row's column5 and the upper row's columns5-8. For test input:\n\nlower row5's column5:0.\n\nupper row0's columns5-8:0,0,4,0.\n\nSo output row0 would be [0,0,4,0]. Doesn't fit training examples.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll look for another pattern. Let's think of the output as a 4x4 matrix where each element is derived from specific positions in the input's upper and lower halves.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the values from the input's row5,6,7,8, column5, and upper rows' columns1-3.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, I'll make a guess based on the first training example's pattern. \n\nIn example0, output row0 is [6,7,7,7]. 6 is from row5, column5. 7s are from row0's columns1-3.\n\nFor the test input's row5, column5 is0. Upper row0's columns1-3 are7,7,0. So output row0 would be [0,7,7,0]. But training example0's row5's column5 is6, which matches.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output rows are formed by the sum of the lower row's column5 and the upper row's columns1-3. But this would result in numbers higher than individual elements, which doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the lower row's column5 and the upper row's columns5,6,7,8. For example:\n\nTest input's row5: column5=0.\n\nUpper row0's columns5-8:0,0,4,0.\n\nSo output row0 would be [0,0,0,4,0]. But output rows have four elements.\n\nThis is taking too long, and I need to provide an answer. Based on the pattern observed in example0 and example1, I'll assume that each output row is formed by taking the lower row's column5 and the upper row's columns1-3, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nThus, for the test input:\n\nrow0: lower row5's column5 (0) and upper row0's columns1-3 (7,7,0) \u2192 [0,7,7,0]\n\nrow1: lower row6's column5 (6) and upper row1's columns1-3 (7,7,0) \u2192 [6,7,7,0]\n\nrow2: lower row7's column5 (6) and upper row2's columns1-3 (7,7,7) \u2192 [6,7,7,7]\n\nrow3: lower row8's column5 (0) and upper row3's columns1-3 (0,0,0) \u2192 [0,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, none of the outputs have zeros like this. For example, example0's output row3 is [7,0,0,8]. So this approach must be wrong.\n\nAlternative Idea: The output rows are formed by combining elements from the upper and lower quadrants in a cross pattern. For example, the first element of each output row is the first non-zero element in the upper quadrant's row, and the rest are from the lower quadrant's row.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll proceed to write the output based on the initial pattern I thought of, even if it's not perfect.",
