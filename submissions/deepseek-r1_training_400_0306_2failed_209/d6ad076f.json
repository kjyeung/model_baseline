        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples, then apply that to the test input. Let me start by looking at each example carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input has a block of 2s in rows 1-3 and columns 1-4. Then there's a block of 7s in rows 7-9 and columns 0-5. The output adds a block of 8s in rows 4-6 and columns 2-3. So where did those 8s come from? The 8s are placed in the middle between the 2s and 7s. The original middle rows (4-6) were all zeros. The 8s form a vertical line between the two existing blocks.\n\nIn Example 1: The input has 4s on the left in rows 1-8 (columns 1-3) and 6s on the right in rows 3-7 (columns 7-9). The output adds 8s in rows 4-6, columns 4-6. Wait, the 8s are placed between the 4s and 6s. The position is where there's a gap between the two existing blocks. So again, the 8s are inserted in the middle of the vertical space where there's a gap between the two different number blocks.\n\nExample 2: Input has 3s at the top (rows 0-2, columns 0-8) and 9s at the bottom (rows 8-9, columns 3-8). The output adds 8s in the middle rows (3-7) around columns 4-7. This seems like the middle area between the 3s and 9s. The 3s end at row 2, and the 9s start at row 8. The 8s are placed in between, centered vertically and perhaps aligned horizontally between the two blocks.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: when there are two separate blocks of numbers (non-zero) in the grid, the transformation adds a new block of 8s in the middle region between them. The 8s are placed in the vertical and horizontal midpoint between the two existing blocks.\n\nWait, let's check the positions more precisely. For Example 0: The 2s are from row 1-3 and columns 1-4. The 7s are rows 7-9, columns 0-5. The vertical midpoint between row 3 (end of 2s) and row 7 (start of 7s) is row 5. But in the output, the 8s start at row 4. Hmm, maybe it's the vertical center of the entire grid. The grid is 10 rows. The 2s are near the top, 7s near the bottom. The middle rows would be 4-6. And the 8s are placed there. Also, horizontally, the 2s are in columns 1-4, the 7s in 0-5. The horizontal midpoint? The 2s span columns 1-4 (width 4), 7s span 0-5 (width 6). The overlapping columns might be 1-4. But the 8s are placed in columns 2-3. That's centered within the 2s. Or maybe the horizontal position is where the two blocks overlap or the middle between their starting and ending points.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are placed in the overlapping columns? For example, the 2s in columns 1-4 and 7s in 0-5. The overlapping columns are 1-4. The 8s are in columns 2-3, which is the center of that overlap. So perhaps the 8s are placed in the center of the overlapping columns between the two blocks.\n\nIn Example 1: The 4s are in columns 1-3, 6s in 7-9. There's a gap between them. The 8s are placed in columns 4-6, which is the space between. So maybe when the two blocks are separated horizontally, the 8s fill the horizontal gap. Similarly, vertically, the 4s end at row 8 (except the output shows that the 4s in row 8 are still there, but in the input, the 4s go up to row 8 except row 8 has columns 1-3). The 6s start at row 3. The vertical midpoint between those might be around rows 5-6. But the 8s are added in rows 4-6. Hmm, not sure. Maybe the vertical placement is where there's a vertical gap between the two blocks. The 4s go from row 1 to row 8 (but in rows 3-7, the 6s are also present). Wait, the input for example 1 has 4s in rows 1-8 (but row 8's 4s are in columns 1-3, but the output shows that row 8's 4s are still there. The 6s start in row 3. So vertically, the 4s are from row 1-8, but the 6s are from 3-7. The 8s in the output are added in rows 4-6, which is the overlapping vertical area between the 4s and 6s. But how does that fit with the pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the intersection area where both the vertical and horizontal gaps between the two blocks meet. For example, between the 4s (left) and 6s (right), the horizontal gap is columns 4-6. Vertically, the 4s run from row 1 to 8, but the 6s are from row 3 to 7. So the vertical overlap is rows 3-7. The 8s are placed in rows 4-6 (middle of 3-7) and columns 4-6 (the horizontal gap). That seems to fit.\n\nIn Example 2: The 3s are in rows 0-2, columns 0-8. The 9s are rows 8-9, columns 3-8. The vertical gap between them is rows 3-7. The horizontal overlap is columns 3-8 (since 3s are up to column 8, 9s start at column 3). The 8s are placed in rows 3-7 and columns 4-7. So within the vertical gap and centered in the overlapping horizontal area. The columns 4-7 are the middle of 3-8 (columns 3-8 have 6 elements, so 4-7 is the middle four columns). So perhaps the 8s are placed in the vertical gap between the two blocks and in the horizontal overlap area, centered.\n\nPutting this together: The pattern is that when there are two distinct blocks (non-zero, different numbers) in the grid, the transformation adds a new block of 8s in the area that is vertically between the two blocks and horizontally in the overlapping or adjacent regions. The exact position seems to be where the vertical midpoint between the two blocks is, and horizontally centered in the combined horizontal span.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRows are 0-9. Let's see the structure. The input has 1s in rows 0-7 (columns 0-3), and 2s in rows 1-6 (columns 7-9). So the 1s are a vertical block from row 0 to 7 (except row 0 is only columns 0-3, but rows 1-7 have 1s in columns 0-3). The 2s are from rows 1-6, columns 7-9. So vertically, the 1s are from row 0 to 7, the 2s from row 1-6. So the vertical gap between them is minimal (they overlap in rows 1-6). But maybe the vertical placement for 8s is between the 1s and 2s, but since they overlap, maybe the 8s are placed in the vertical middle between the start of 1s (row 0) and end of 2s (row 6). The vertical midpoint between row 0 and row 6 is around row 3. But perhaps the vertical placement is in the rows where there's a gap between the two blocks. Wait, but in the test input, the 1s go down to row 7, and the 2s are up to row 6. So between row 7 (1s) and row 6 (2s) there's no vertical gap. Hmm, maybe the vertical placement is between the two blocks when there is a vertical separation. Wait, in the test input, the 1s are in rows 0-7 (columns 0-3), and the 2s are in rows 1-6 (columns 7-9). So the 1s and 2s are overlapping vertically (rows 1-6) but separated horizontally. So the 8s should be placed in the horizontal gap between 1s (columns 0-3) and 2s (columns7-9). The horizontal gap is columns 4-6. Vertically, since the two blocks overlap in rows 1-6, perhaps the 8s are placed in the same vertical range. So the 8s would be placed in columns 4-6, rows 1-6. Let's check the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2s and 7s are vertically separated. The 8s are placed in between. In Example 1, the 4s and 6s are vertically overlapping (since 4s go up to row 8 and 6s start at row3), but the 8s are placed in rows4-6. So even if there's vertical overlap, maybe the 8s are placed in the overlapping rows. Wait, but in Example 1, the 4s are from row1 to row8 (but in row3, the 4s are in columns1-3 and the 6s start in columns7-9). The 8s are placed in rows4-6, which is in the middle of the vertical span of the 4s and 6s. So perhaps the vertical placement is the middle of the vertical range where both blocks are present. For the test input, the 1s and 2s are both present in rows1-6. The vertical middle would be rows3-4. But the training examples added 8s in the vertical middle of the two blocks. Wait, maybe the vertical placement is the middle between the vertical start of the lower block and the vertical end of the upper block. Let me check Example0. Upper block (2s) ends at row3, lower block (7s) starts at row7. Middle is rows5. But the 8s are in rows4-6. Maybe it's the entire space between. For Example0, between row3 (end of 2s) and row7 (start of 7s), the middle rows are4-6, so 8s are there. In Example1, the 4s are in rows1-8, and 6s in rows3-7. The overlapping rows are3-7. The 8s are placed in rows4-6, which is the middle of the overlapping rows. For the test input, the 1s (rows0-7) and 2s (rows1-6) overlap in rows1-6. The vertical middle of the overlapping rows (rows1-6) is rows3-4. But in the training examples, the 8s cover multiple rows. For example, in Example0, 3 rows. In Example1, 3 rows. Example2 has 5 rows. So maybe the 8s are placed in the vertical middle of the overlapping area. For the test input, overlapping rows are1-6 (6 rows). The middle would be rows3-4. But perhaps the 8s are placed in the vertical space between the two blocks. Wait, the 1s go down to row7 (but the 2s end at row6). So between row6 (end of 2s) and row7 (still 1s). No gap there. So maybe the 8s are placed in the horizontal gap between the 1s and 2s. The 1s are columns0-3, 2s are columns7-9. The horizontal gap is columns4-6. So in the rows where both 1s and 2s are present (rows1-6), inserting 8s in columns4-6. Let's check the training examples for this scenario.\n\nIn Example1, the 4s are left (columns1-3) and 6s are right (columns7-9), horizontal gap columns4-6. The 8s are placed there. So yes, the horizontal gap between two blocks. Vertically, in the overlapping rows. So for the test input, the horizontal gap is columns4-6, and the overlapping rows where both 1s and 2s are present are rows1-6. So the 8s should be placed in rows1-6, columns4-6. Let's see if this fits.\n\nBut in the test input, the output would then have 8s in rows1-6, columns4-6. Let's see. Let me check the test input rows:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRows1-6: each starts with 1s (columns0-3), 0s in 4-6, and 2s in7-9.\n\nRows7: [1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRows8-9: all zeros.\n\nSo inserting 8s in rows1-6, columns4-6. So changing those 0s to 8s. That would make the output for rows1-6 have 8s in columns4-6. For example, row1 would be [1,1,1,1,8,8,8,2,2,2], but wait, original row1 in input is [1,1,1,1,0,0,0,2,2,2]. So columns4-6 (indices 4,5,6) are 0s. So replacing those 0s with 8s. So row1 becomes [1,1,1,1,8,8,8,2,2,2]. Similarly for rows2-6. Then the rows7-9 remain as they are, except row7 is [1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] and rows8-9 are zeros. So the output would have 8s in rows1-6, columns4-6.\n\nBut let me check the training examples. In Example1, the 8s are in rows4-6, columns4-6. The 4s are in columns1-3, 6s in7-9. So the 8s are between them in columns4-6. So yes, same pattern. So for the test input, the 8s should be in columns4-6, rows1-6.\n\nBut looking at the test input's input structure, rows1-6 have 1s on the left (columns0-3), 2s on the right (columns7-9), and 0s in between. So inserting 8s in columns4-6 in those rows.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nFor rows1-6:\n\n[1,1,1,1,8,8,8,2,2,2]\n\nAnd the rest as per the input, except those positions.\n\nSo let's format that.\n\nThe test input is:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [1,1,1,1,0,0,0,2,2,2]\n\nRow2: same as row1.\n\nRow3-6: same as row1.\n\nRow7: [1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRows8-9: all zeros.\n\nAfter transformation, rows1-6 would have columns4-6 changed to 8s.\n\nSo the output for row1: [1,1,1,1,8,8,8,2,2,2]\n\nSame for rows2-6.\n\nRow7 remains as [1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRows0,8,9 unchanged.\n\nSo the final output should look like that.\n\nLet me cross-verify with the training examples. In Example1, the input has 4s on the left and 6s on the right. The 8s are added in between. Similarly here, the 8s are between 1s and 2s.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So the answer should replace columns4-6 in rows1-6 with 8s.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 10x10 grid of numbers, and the output modifies some parts of it. Let me go through each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0: The input has regions of 2s at the top-middle and 7s at the bottom-left. The output adds a new region of 8s in the middle. The original 2s and 7s are still there. The 8s are placed in rows 4-6, columns 2-3. Hmm, maybe there's a connection between the existing regions. The 2s are in rows 1-3, columns 1-4, and the 7s are in rows 7-9, columns 0-5. The 8s are sandwiched between them. But how?\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 4s on the left-middle and 6s on the right. The output adds 8s in between those regions. The 4s are in rows 1-8, columns 1-3, and the 6s are in rows 3-7, columns 7-9. The 8s are inserted in rows 4-6, columns 4-6. So again, between the two existing regions. So maybe the pattern is that wherever two separate regions (different numbers) are present, we add an 8-filled region in the overlapping area or between them?\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input has 3s at the top and 9s at the bottom. The output adds 8s in the middle. The 3s are in rows 0-2, columns 0-8, and the 9s are in rows 8-9, columns 3-8. The 8s are in rows 3-7, columns 4-7. So between the two existing regions. But in this case, the middle rows were empty except for the 8s added. So the 8s are placed in the middle area between the two existing blocks.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is: identify the vertical space between the bottom of the upper block and the top of the lower block, and fill that space with 8s. Let me check the vertical positions.\n\nIn Example 0: The upper block (2s) ends at row 3. The lower block (7s) starts at row 7. So the space between rows 4-6 is filled with 8s. Exactly. The 8s are placed in the rows between the two existing blocks.\n\nIn Example 1: The upper block (4s) ends at row 8, but the lower block (6s) starts at row 3. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, no. Wait the 6s in Example 1's input start at row 3 and go down to row 7, but the 4s are from row 1 to row 8. Wait, this seems overlapping. Wait, maybe the blocks are arranged in a way that there's a vertical overlap. But maybe the approach is different. Let me look again.\n\nWait in Example 1's input, the 4s are in rows 1-8 (except row 0 and 9), and the 6s start at row 3 and go to row7. So the 4s are present even in the same rows as the 6s. But the output adds 8s in rows 4-6, columns 4-6. Hmm, perhaps the 8s are placed in the middle of where the two regions are overlapping horizontally? Wait the 4s are on the left (columns 1-3) and the 6s on the right (columns 7-9). The 8s are in the middle columns (4-6), which is between them. So maybe the vertical position is between the two regions. But in that case, the rows are where both blocks are present. So perhaps the 8s are placed in the rows where both blocks are present, but in the columns between them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the intersection of the vertical projection. Wait, perhaps the algorithm is: for each row where there are two different numbers present (not zero) in different columns, then insert 8s in between those regions in the same row. But how does that apply across examples.\n\nWait in Example 0, the upper region is 2s (rows 1-3), lower is 7s (rows7-9). Between them (rows4-6) are filled with 8s. So maybe the 8s are added in the middle of the vertical gap between two blocks. The vertical gap is between row3 and row7. The middle of that gap would be rows4-6.\n\nIn Example1, the upper block (4s) extends down to row8, and the lower block (6s) is in rows3-7. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the 6s start at row3 and go down to row7. The 4s are in rows1-8. So the vertical gap between 4s and 6s? But they are overlapping in rows3-7. Wait, maybe the vertical positioning isn't the key here. Alternatively, looking horizontally: the 4s are on the left (columns1-3), 6s on the right (columns7-9). So the 8s are in columns4-6, which is between them. So perhaps in each row where both a 4 and 6 are present, insert 8s in the columns between their regions. But in Example1's input, in rows3-7, the 4s are in columns1-3 and 6s in columns7-9. So between columns4-6, which are zeros. So in the output, those columns are filled with 8s in rows4-6. Wait, why rows4-6? Because maybe it's the middle of the overlapping rows? So rows3-7 for the 6s. So the middle rows would be 5, but perhaps they chose rows4-6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are placed in the overlapping rows of the two regions, but that's not the case here. The 4s are in rows1-8 and 6s in rows3-7, so overlapping rows are 3-7. The 8s are placed in rows4-6. So the middle of the overlapping rows.\n\nIn Example2, the 3s are in rows0-2 and the 9s in rows8-9. The vertical gap is from row3 to row7. The middle of that would be rows5-6, but in the output, the 8s are in rows3-7. Wait, that's the entire gap. So perhaps when two separate regions are vertically separated, fill the entire gap between them with 8s. Let me check:\n\nExample0: upper ends at row3, lower starts at row7. So gap rows4-6. Output fills those rows with 8s.\n\nExample1: the 4s are present up to row8, and the 6s start at row3. Wait, but in this case, the 6s start at row3 and the 4s go down to row8. So the overlapping rows are 3-7 (since 6s are up to row7). The output adds 8s in rows4-6. So the middle three rows of the overlapping region.\n\nExample2: the 3s end at row2, 9s start at row8. The gap is rows3-7. Output adds 8s in rows3-7. So the entire gap. But in the other examples, only part of the overlapping rows.\n\nHmm, this is a bit inconsistent. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the numbers: the output always adds 8s. So the pattern must be that between certain regions, 8s are added. Let's think about the positions:\n\nIn Example0: the upper 2s are in rows1-3, columns1-4. The lower 7s are in rows7-9, columns0-5. The 8s are added in rows4-6, columns2-3. Wait, columns2-3 are within the 2s' columns (1-4) and also within the 7s' columns (0-5). So the overlapping columns between the upper and lower regions. So perhaps the 8s are placed in the intersection of the column ranges of the upper and lower regions, and in the rows between them.\n\nIn Example0, upper columns 1-4, lower columns 0-5. Intersection is 1-4. So 8s are placed in columns2-3, which is centered in that range. Maybe the middle two columns of the overlapping column range.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1: upper columns 1-3 (4s), lower columns7-9 (6s). The 8s are placed in columns4-6, which is between them. So the columns between the upper and lower regions. So the 8s are in the columns that are between the upper region's right end and the lower region's left end.\n\nIn Example1's input, the 4s are on the left (columns1-3), 6s on the right (7-9). The 8s are in columns4-6, which is the space between them.\n\nIn Example2, upper 3s are in columns0-8 (rows0-2), lower 9s in columns3-8 (rows8-9). So the overlapping columns are 3-8. The 8s are placed in columns4-7. So the middle of the overlapping columns. But the rows are between the upper and lower regions.\n\nWait, so maybe the pattern is:\n\nFor any two distinct regions (groups of the same number, not zero) that are vertically separated (one above the other), insert a block of 8s in the rows between them, and in the columns that are the intersection or between their column ranges.\n\nBut how to determine the exact columns? Let's see:\n\nIn Example0: upper region columns1-4, lower region columns0-5. Intersection is columns1-4. So the 8s are placed in columns2-3, which is the middle two columns of that intersection. The rows between the upper and lower regions (rows4-6).\n\nIn Example1: upper region (4s) columns1-3, lower region (6s) columns7-9. The space between is columns4-6. So the 8s are placed there. Rows where? The upper region is in rows1-8, lower in rows3-7. The overlapping rows are 3-7. But the 8s are placed in rows4-6. Middle three rows of the overlapping rows.\n\nIn Example2: upper region columns0-8 (3s), lower region columns3-8 (9s). Intersection is 3-8. Middle of that is columns5-6? But the 8s are placed in columns4-7. Hmm. Wait the upper region's columns are 0-8, lower's 3-8. The overlapping columns are 3-8. The middle of that is columns5-6 (since 3-8 is 6 columns). So maybe the 8s are placed in columns 4-7 (which is 4 columns). Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the entire overlapping column range is used. But in example0, the intersection was 1-4 (4 columns) and the 8s are placed in 2-3 (2 columns). So perhaps it's taking the central part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are placed in the columns that are common between the upper and lower regions. For example, in example0, upper and lower regions overlap in columns1-4 (since upper is 1-4, lower 0-5). So the intersection is 1-4. Then the 8s are placed in columns2-3, which is the middle two columns of the intersection. In example2, upper columns0-8, lower 3-8. Intersection is 3-8. Middle of this range is 5.5, so columns5-6? But in the output, it's columns4-7. Hmm, that's four columns. Maybe it's taking the entire intersection and centering the 8s. Or perhaps the 8s are placed in the columns where the lower region starts. Like, in example2, the lower region starts at column3. So the 8s start at column4, which is next. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the area that's directly between the two regions. For example, in Example1, the upper region ends at column3, the lower starts at column7. So between them is columns4-6. So 8s are placed there. In example0, upper ends at column4, lower starts at column0 but extends up to 5. So maybe the overlapping area is 1-4, and 8s are placed in the middle. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are placed in the columns that are the union of the two regions' columns. Wait in example0, upper is 1-4, lower is 0-5. Union is 0-5, but the 8s are in 2-3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let me approach it differently.\n\nLooking at all examples, the output introduces a new block of 8s. Let's see:\n\nIn each input, there are two main regions (non-zero numbers) that are positioned in such a way that there's a vertical and/or horizontal gap between them. The 8s are added in that gap.\n\nSo the key is to identify the two regions and then find the gap between them, then fill that gap with 8s.\n\nSo for each example:\n\nExample0: two regions (2s and 7s). The 2s are in rows1-3, columns1-4. The 7s are in rows7-9, columns0-5. The vertical gap is rows4-6. The horizontal overlap is columns1-4 (since 2s are 1-4 and 7s are 0-5). So the 8s are placed in the vertical gap (rows4-6) and the horizontal overlap (columns1-4), but centered. So columns2-3, which is the middle two columns of the 1-4 range.\n\nExample1: two regions (4s and 6s). 4s are left side (cols1-3), 6s are right (7-9). The vertical overlap is rows3-7 (since 6s are in rows3-7 and 4s are up to row8). The horizontal gap between 4s and 6s is columns4-6. So 8s are placed in the vertical overlap's middle rows (4-6) and the horizontal gap (4-6).\n\nExample2: 3s (top, cols0-8) and 9s (bottom, cols3-8). Vertical gap is rows3-7. The horizontal overlap is cols3-8. So 8s are placed in vertical gap (rows3-7) and horizontal overlap (cols3-8), but centered. The output shows 8s in cols4-7. So that's four columns within the overlap (3-8 is 6 columns, so middle four? Or maybe it's taking the overlap's start and end. Wait 3-8 is columns 3,4,5,6,7,8. The middle four would be 4-7. So yes, that's where the 8s are.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- Identify the two main non-zero regions (probably the two largest or first two regions).\n- Find the vertical gap between them (the rows between the lower end of the upper region and the upper end of the lower region).\n- Find the horizontal overlap or the gap between their columns.\n- Place 8s in the intersection of these vertical and horizontal ranges.\n\nBut how to determine which regions to consider. Let's check:\n\nIn Example1, there are two regions: 4s and 6s. So the algorithm considers those two.\n\nIn Example0, 2s and 7s. Example2, 3s and 9s. So probably the two distinct non-zero regions in the input.\n\nOnce the two regions are identified, find:\n\nVertical gap: the rows between the upper region's bottom and the lower region's top.\n\nIf the regions are overlapping vertically, then the vertical gap is the overlapping rows, but how? Wait, in Example1, the 4s are from row1 to row8, and the 6s start at row3. So the vertical gap would be the rows where they are overlapping (3-7 for 6s, since 4s are up to row8). So the vertical gap is rows3-7, but the 8s are placed in rows4-6, the middle three.\n\nSo maybe the vertical position is the middle rows of the overlapping region. If the vertical ranges don't overlap (like in Example0 and Example2), then the vertical gap is the rows between them. But in Example1, since the vertical ranges do overlap, the vertical position is the middle rows of the overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical gap is determined by the vertical positions of the two regions. If they are separate (like in Example0 and 2), the entire rows between are filled. If they overlap, then the middle rows of the overlapping are filled.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Identify the two main non-zero regions in the input. Assume they are the two distinct numbers (excluding zeros).\n2. Determine their vertical ranges (start and end rows) and horizontal ranges (start and end columns).\n3. For vertical placement:\n   - If the upper region's end row is below the lower region's start row (i.e., overlapping), then the vertical gap is the overlapping rows. Take the middle third (rounded?) of these.\n   - If the upper region is completely above the lower region, then the vertical gap is the rows between them. Fill all those rows.\n4. For horizontal placement:\n   - If the regions' columns overlap, take the middle part of the overlapping columns.\n   - If the regions' columns are adjacent or separated, take the columns between them.\n5. Fill the resulting area with 8s.\n\nNow let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe two regions here are 1s and 2s. Let's find their vertical and horizontal ranges.\n\nRegion 1 (1s):\n\nRows: From row0 to row7. Columns0-3. Because looking at the input, row0 has 1s in columns0-3. Rows1-7 have 1s in columns0-3. Row7 has 1s up to column3, then zeros. So region 1 is rows0-7, columns0-3.\n\nRegion 2 (2s):\n\nRows: row1 to row6. Columns7-9. Because in rows1-6, columns7-9 are 2s. So region2 is rows1-6, columns7-9.\n\nSo now, vertical ranges:\n\nUpper region (1s): rows0-7.\n\nLower region (2s): rows1-6.\n\nBut wait, the 2s are in rows1-6, which are within the 1s' rows0-7. So they overlap. So the vertical gap is the overlapping rows, which are rows1-6. The middle of these rows would be rows3-4.5, but since we need integer rows, maybe rows3-4, or perhaps the middle three rows. Wait, rows1-6 is 6 rows (1,2,3,4,5,6). The middle three would be 3,4,5. So the vertical placement would be rows3-5.\n\nAlternatively, the entire overlapping rows, but in the examples when overlapping, they took the middle. For instance, Example1's overlapping rows were 3-7, and the 8s were placed in 4-6. So middle three rows.\n\nSo here, overlapping rows are 1-6. The middle three would be rows3-5 (since 1 to6 is six rows, middle is 3.5, so 3-5).\n\nBut let's check the test input's output. The test input has the 1s from row0-7 (columns0-3), and 2s from row1-6 (columns7-9). The vertical gap is overlapping rows1-6. The horizontal gap between 1s (columns0-3) and 2s (columns7-9) is columns4-6. So the 8s should be placed in columns4-6 and rows3-5 (middle three rows of overlapping rows).\n\nLooking at the test input, the rows where both 1s and 2s are present are rows1-6. So rows1-6: 1s in columns0-3, 2s in 7-9. The space between is columns4-6. So the 8s would be in columns4-6, rows3-5.\n\nBut let's see how the training examples handled similar cases. In Example1, the overlapping rows were 3-7, and 8s were placed in 4-6. So middle three rows.\n\nSo applying that here, overlapping rows1-6 (six rows), the middle three would be rows3-5.\n\nThus, the 8s would be placed in rows3-5, columns4-6.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows3-5 and columns4-6, which are all zeros. So replacing those with 8s.\n\nLet's imagine the output. The rows from 3 to5 (rows indexed from0), columns4-6 would be 8s. So for example, row3 would be [1,1,1,1,8,8,8,2,2,2], but wait no. The input's row3 is [1,1,1,1,0,0,0,2,2,2]. After adding 8s in columns4-6 (indices4,5,6), the row becomes [1,1,1,1,8,8,8,2,2,2].\n\nBut wait in Example1, when inserting 8s between 4s and 6s, the inserted 8s were in columns4-6 and rows4-6. Let's check:\n\nIn Example1's input, the 4s are in rows1-8, columns1-3; 6s in rows3-7, columns7-9. The 8s are placed in rows4-6 (middle three of overlapping rows3-7) and columns4-6 (between 3 and7).\n\nSo following that, for the test input, the overlapping rows are1-6 (so six rows), the middle three rows would be 3-5. The columns between the 1s (0-3) and 2s (7-9) are4-6.\n\nTherefore, the 8s should be added in rows3-5, columns4-6.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows3-5:\n\nRow3: [1,1,1,1,0,0,0,2,2,2] \u2192 after adding 8s in columns4-6 \u2192 [1,1,1,1,8,8,8,2,2,2]\n\nRow4: same as row3 \u2192 [1,1,1,1,8,8,8,2,2,2]\n\nRow5: same \u2192 [1,1,1,1,8,8,8,2,2,2]\n\nBut let's check the output format. In the training examples, the 8s are added as a contiguous block, possibly 3 rows. But in Example0, the 8s are in three rows (4-6). Example1, three rows (4-6). Example2, five rows (3-7). Hmm, so maybe the number of rows depends on the vertical gap.\n\nWait, in Example2, the vertical gap was between row2 and row8 (rows3-7, five rows), so the 8s filled all five rows. But in Example0 and 1, the vertical gap was three rows (4-6), so filled three rows. So perhaps when the vertical gap is the space between two regions, the entire gap is filled. But when it's overlapping rows, the middle three are filled.\n\nIn the test input's case, the 1s are from row0-7, and the 2s are row1-6. So the overlapping rows are rows1-6. But the vertical gap would be the overlapping area. So since the 2s are within the 1s' rows, it's more about overlapping. So the middle three rows would be 3-5.\n\nSo inserting 8s in rows3-5, columns4-6.\n\nSo the final output would have those cells changed to 8s.\n\nLet me check the test input's rows3-5:\n\nOriginal:\n\nRow3: [1,1,1,1,0,0,0,2,2,2]\nRow4: [1,1,1,1,0,0,0,2,2,2]\nRow5: [1,1,1,1,0,0,0,2,2,2]\n\nAfter transformation:\n\nRow3: [1,1,1,1,8,8,8,2,2,2]\nRow4: same\nRow5: same\n\nThen, rows6 and 2 would remain as original.\n\nBut wait, the test input's row6 is:\n\nRow6: [1,1,1,1,0,0,0,2,2,2]\n\nBut according to the pattern, only rows3-5 would have 8s. So row6 remains unchanged.\n\nYes. So the output should have 8s in rows3-5, columns4-6.\n\nSo the final answer should look like:\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
