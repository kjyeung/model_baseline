        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by looking at the training examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input has multiple arrays. The output is three arrays: [1, 0, 3], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0]. Hmm. Let me check the input arrays. The first few arrays are mostly zeros with 4s in certain positions, then there's a line of all 4s. Then there's an array like [4,4,4,...,1,4,4,1,...3, etc. Maybe looking for changes in those middle values?\n\nWait, the outputs in Example 0 are three elements each. Let's see, maybe each output array corresponds to some part of the input. Let me check the input structure. The input in Example 0 has 29 elements in each array. The output has three arrays, each with three elements. How does that map?\n\nLooking at the first output array [1,0,3]. Let's check the input arrays. The fifth row in the input (since the first line is [0,0,4...] and the fifth line is similar, but the sixth line is [4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,1,4,4,3...]. Maybe the output is derived from specific positions in certain input rows.\n\nWait, the output arrays are three elements each. Let me check the inputs where the value changes. For example, in Example 0's input, the 6th row (index 5 if starting from 0) has 1s and 3s. The first output is [1,0,3]. Maybe those numbers are taken from specific positions in that row. Let's see: the 6th row starts with 4s, then at position 5 (0-based index 5) there's a 1. Then at index 11, there's a 3. Then maybe the next elements are 4s. So the output [1,0,3] could be the first non-4 values in that row. But where does 0 come from? Maybe there's a 0 in between. Wait, looking at row 5: [4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,1,4,4,3,...]. So the first 1 is at index 5, then index 8 is another 1, then index 11 is 3, then index 14 is 3. But the output is [1,0,3]. Maybe the first three non-4 values in that row are 1,1,3, but the output has 1,0,3. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output corresponds to the positions where the value changes from the default (which is 4 in this example). For the first output [1,0,3], maybe those are the new values introduced in that row. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the first output is [1,0,3], then [1,0,0], then [1,0,0]. Maybe each output line corresponds to a specific row in the input. Let's check. The input has 28 rows. The output has 3 lines. That doesn't directly align. Maybe the output is generated by looking at certain rows in the input, perhaps every nth row. Or maybe the output is formed by taking the first three non-default values in each relevant row.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the sixth input row (index 5) has 4s except for 1, 1, 3, 3, etc. So the first three non-4 values are 1,1,3. But the output is [1,0,3]. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output counts the number of times a new number appears in certain positions. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the sum or some operation on the input rows.\n\nWait, looking at all examples. Example 1's output includes [0,2,0], [2,0,0], [0,0,8]. The input here uses 3 as the main number, and in the rows where there are 2s and 8s. So maybe the output captures the new numbers introduced in specific positions.\n\nAnother approach: Each example's output is three lines. Let's see how many lines of input each example has. Example 0's input has 28 lines (counting each array as a line), and the output has 3 lines. So maybe each output line corresponds to a group of input lines. For example, maybe every 9 input lines correspond to one output line. But 28 is not a multiple of 9. Alternatively, each output line is derived from a specific section of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a 2D grid (like a matrix) and the output is some transformation of it, such as certain cells. But each input line is a row of the matrix. Let's see the dimensions. For Example 0, each input line has 29 elements, and there are 28 lines. So it's a 28x29 grid. The output is 3 lines of 3 elements each. That's a big reduction. Maybe it's taking certain cells from the input grid. For example, the center or specific positions.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the sixth line (index 5) is [4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,1,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. The output's first line is [1,0,3]. Maybe the positions of the non-4 values here are at indices 5, 8, 11, 14. But the output has three elements. So maybe the first three unique non-4 values? But in this line, the values are 1,1,3,3. The unique values are 1 and 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first three non-default numbers from the first, middle, and last significant rows. Let's look at Example 1's input. The first few rows are 3s, then in row 7 (index 7), the array starts with 3s and then has 2s. The output for Example 1 is [0,2,0], [2,0,0], [0,0,8]. The first output line's 2 might come from the 2 in the 7th row. The third output line's 8 comes from row 15, which has 8s.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the 7th input row is [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,...]. The output first line is [0,2,0]. Maybe the 2s are at positions 7 and 11. But how does that translate to the output array [0,2,0]?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is capturing the changes in specific columns. For instance, in the input rows that are not all the same (like the rows with 3s except for some 2s or 8s), the output takes the new numbers from certain columns. For example, in Example 1's 7th row, the 7th element (index 7) is 2, and the 11th element is 2. The output [0,2,0] could be the 2s in positions 7 and 11. But the output has three elements. Maybe columns 7, 11, and another?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the unique new numbers introduced in the non-uniform rows. For example, in Example 0's 5th row, the new numbers are 1,3. But the output is [1,0,3]. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output arrays across examples. The outputs have numbers that are present in the input but not the default (e.g., 4 in Example 0, 3 in Example 1, 1 in Example 2, 8 in Example 3). So perhaps each output line captures the first three unique non-default numbers from certain rows.\n\nIn Example 0's output [1,0,3], 1 and 3 are the non-4 values. But where does the 0 come from? Maybe 0 is part of the count or positions. Alternatively, maybe it's the number of occurrences. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output [1,0,2], [0,0,2], [2,2,2]. The input rows have 8s as the default. In the 7th row, there are 1s and 2s. The first output line is [1,0,2], perhaps taking the 1, then 0 (maybe no change in another position?), then 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output lines correspond to specific sections of the input grid. For instance, the first output line is from the top third, the second from the middle, and the third from the bottom third of the input. Then, within those sections, they take the first three non-default numbers.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first significant non-4 row is row 5, which has 1,1,3,3. The first three non-4 values are 1,1,3. But the output is [1,0,3]. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the first three unique values in order of appearance. So 1 and 3, but how to get three elements?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the counts of non-default numbers in each third of the input. But in Example 0, the output is three arrays. Maybe each array corresponds to a vertical slice of the input grid. For example, splitting the grid into three parts left, middle, right, and then for each part, extract some information.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each output line has three elements, maybe it's the first three non-default elements encountered in the entire input. But in Example 0, the first non-4 is in row 5, which has 1, then another 1, then 3, so the output would be [1,1,3], but the first output is [1,0,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is related to the positions where the non-default values occur. For example, in Example 0's row 5, the first non-4 is at index 5 (value 1), then index 8 (value 1), index 11 (value 3). Maybe the output captures these values. So the first three non-default values are 1,1,3. But the output is [1,0,3]. The 0 doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the test input. The test input has arrays with 0s and 2s as defaults. The non-defaults are 1,4,8. For example, in row 4 (0-based index 4), which is [2,2,2,2,1,2,...], then later in row 14, it's [2,2,2,2,8,...]. So perhaps the output will capture the first three non-2 values in certain rows.\n\nLooking at the test input's row 4: 2,2,2,2,1,2,... So the first non-2 is 1 at position 4. Then in row 14, the first non-2 is 8. Then maybe other rows. But how does this translate to the output?\n\nLooking back at the training examples. For example, in Example 3, the output is [1,0,2], [0,0,2], [2,2,2]. The input has 8 as the default. The first output line comes from row 7 (index 7), which has 1,1,2,2. So maybe the output takes the first three non-8 values, which are 1,1,2, but the output is [1,0,2]. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the unique values. 1 and 2, but the output has three elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first three non-default values in three different rows. For example, in Example 3, first output line [1,0,2] comes from row 7's non-8 values (1, 2), and perhaps zeros from elsewhere. But not sure.\n\nAnother possibility: The input represents a grid where certain rows have patterns, and the output is encoding those patterns. For example, in Example 0's input, the rows with 4s and then some 1s and 3s. The output could be the numbers that appear in certain positions. For instance, the first output line [1,0,3] could correspond to the first occurrence of 1, then no occurrence (0), then first occurrence of 3. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the count of specific numbers in each third of the input. For example, split the input into three vertical sections, count the number of non-default numbers in each. But in Example 0, the output is [1,0,3], which could mean 1 non-4 in the first third, 0 in the middle, 3 in the last. But need to check.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the sum of non-default values in each third. But in Example 0's first output line, sum of non-4s in first third would be 1+1=2, but output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me look for another pattern. The output arrays in the examples are three elements each, and each element seems to be a number that appears in the input. For example:\n\n- Example 0's outputs: 1,0,3; 1,0,0; 1,0,0. The 1 and 3 are present in the input.\n- Example 1's outputs: 0,2,0; 2,0,0; 0,0,8. The 2 and 8 are in the input.\n- Example 2's outputs: 6,6,0; 0,0,0; 3,3,3. The 6 and 3 are in the input.\n- Example 3's outputs: 1,0,2; 0,0,2; 2,2,2. The 1, 2 are in the input.\n\nThe zeros in the output might indicate that there's no non-default value in that segment. So perhaps the output is divided into three parts, and each part takes the first non-default value in that segment. If there's none, it's zero.\n\nFor example, split each input row into three equal parts, and for each part, take the first non-default value. If none, zero. Then, the output arrays are the first three rows where this happens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output line corresponds to a specific row in the input, and each element in the output line is the first non-default value in each third of that row.\n\nFor example, take a row, split into three parts. For each part, find the first non-default number, or 0 if all are default.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first output line [1,0,3]. Let's take the sixth row (index 5) of Example 0's input, which is [4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,1,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. Split into three parts: first third (positions 0-9), second third (10-19), third (20-28). \n\nFirst third: positions 0-9. The elements are 4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,1,4. The first non-4 is 1 at position 5. So first part is 1.\n\nSecond third: positions 10-19: 4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,4. The first non-4 is 3 at position 12. But the output's second element is 0. Hmm, this doesn't align. So maybe that's not the approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output corresponds to three different rows in the input, each contributing one element. For example, the first element of the output is from row X, the second from row Y, and third from row Z. But how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output lines are formed by taking the first three rows in the input that have non-default values and extracting certain information from them. For example, in Example 0, the sixth row (index 5) has non-4 values. The first non-4 is 1. Then the next such row (index 8) has non-4 values. But in the output, there are three lines. This seems unclear.\n\nAnother angle: The output arrays have three elements. Let's see if they match the number of non-default values in certain rows. For Example 0's first output line [1,0,3], the corresponding row (index 5) has two non-4 values (1 and 3), but the output has three elements. Maybe it's counting occurrences. Alternatively, perhaps the output represents the positions where the non-default values first appear in each third of the input.\n\nAlternatively, considering the test input. The test input has rows with 0s and 2s as default. Some rows have 1,4,8. For example, row 4 (0-based index 4) is [2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]. So the non-2 values are 1,1,4,4. Then row 14 is [2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2], with non-2 values as 8,8,8,8.\n\nSo the output might capture these non-2 values. Maybe each output line corresponds to a row with non-default values. For example, the first output line could be from row 4, which has 1 and 4. But how to get three elements.\n\nLooking at the training examples again, Example 0's output is three arrays. Each array has three elements. The first array is [1,0,3], the second [1,0,0], third [1,0,0]. So maybe each output array corresponds to a different non-default row in the input. For Example 0, there are three non-default rows (index 5, 8, 11, 14, etc.), but the output has three arrays. So perhaps each output array is derived from a specific non-default row. For example, the first output array is from the first non-default row, the second from the second, etc.\n\nIn Example 0, the first non-default row (index 5) has 1,1,3,3. The output array [1,0,3] could be taking the first three unique non-4 values. But 1 and 3. Not three elements. Alternatively, taking the first, second, and third unique non-4 values. But there are only two. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, each output array is the first three non-default values encountered in the input. For Example 0, the first three non-4 values are 1,1,3. So the first output array is [1,1,3], but the actual output is [1,0,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is counting the number of times a non-default value appears in each third of the input. For example, in Example 0's first non-default row (index 5), split into three parts. First third has two 1s, so count is 2. Second third has two 3s, count 2. Third third all 4s, count 0. But output is [1,0,3]. Not sure.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is formed by looking at the positions where the non-default values first appear in each of three columns. For instance, split the grid into three columns, and for each column, take the first non-default value found. But given that the input is row-major, this would require examining each column.\n\nBut how? For Example 0's input, each row is 29 elements. Splitting into three columns would be roughly 9 or 10 elements each. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are the first three non-default numbers from the first three rows that have non-default values. For example, in Example 0, the first non-default row (index 5) has 1, next (index 8) has 3, next (index 11) has 4 again. So the first three non-default rows would contribute 1, 3, maybe something else. But the output is three arrays, not a single array.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Let's look for another pattern. The output arrays in the examples seem to have the same structure as the non-default rows in the input. For example, in Example 3's output:\n\n[1,0,2]\n\n[0,0,2]\n\n[2,2,2]\n\nThese correspond to the non-default rows in the input. For example, the first non-default row in Example 3's input is row 7, which has 1s and 2s. The output line [1,0,2] could be taking the first, second, and third non-8 values from that row, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a downsampling of the input grid. For instance, taking every nth element from certain rows and columns. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the test input's non-default rows are rows 4,9,14,19. Each has non-2 values. For example:\n\nRow 4: 1 and 4.\n\nRow 9: same as row 4.\n\nRow 14: 8.\n\nRow 19: 8.\n\nSo the output might take the first three non-2 values from each of these rows.\n\nFor row 4: 1 appears at position 4, then again at position 9. So first non-2 is 1, then next non-2 is 1 again. Then at position 14, it's 4. So maybe the first three non-2 values are 1,1,4. But the output arrays have three elements each. How many output arrays would there be? The training examples have three output arrays for each test case, regardless of the number of non-default rows. So for the test input, we need to produce three output arrays. Let's see.\n\nIf each output array corresponds to a non-default row:\n\nFirst non-default row (row 4) has non-2 values 1,1,4,4. So output array could be [1,4,0]. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the first output array takes the first three non-2 values from the first non-default row: 1,1,4. But the output should be three elements. The training examples have outputs like [1,0,3], which includes a zero. Maybe if there are fewer than three non-default values in a row, pad with zeros. So for the test input's row 4, the non-2 values are 1 (at positions 4,9,14,19). So first three are 1,1,4. But the output would need to be [1,1,4]. But looking at the training examples, in Example 3, the first output line is [1,0,2]. If in a row there are two non-default values, the third element is zero. But in row 7 of Example 3, the non-8 values are 1,2, so maybe the output is [1,0,2], with 0 padding. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array corresponds to a triplet of non-default rows, taking the first non-default value from each. For example, in the test input, rows 4,9,14,19 are non-default. So three output arrays:\n\nFirst output array: first non-default values from rows 4,9,14 \u2192 1,1,8.\n\nBut the output arrays in the examples have three elements each. For instance, Example 0's outputs are [1,0,3], [1,0,0], [1,0,0]. So maybe each output array is derived from a group of three non-default rows, taking their first non-default value, then zeros if there are less than three.\n\nBut the test input has four non-default rows (4,9,14,19). So the output would have four arrays, but the training examples have three. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is always three arrays regardless of the input, and each array corresponds to the first three non-default values encountered in the entire input. For example, the first output array is the first three non-default values, the second array is the next three, and the third array is the next three after that. But in Example 0, the first three non-4 values are 1,1,3. So output would be [1,1,3], but the actual output is [1,0,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are the counts of each non-default value in certain sections. For example, in Example 0, the first output line counts 1 appearing twice and 3 appearing once. So [1,0,3] could be 1 once, 0 for another, 3 once. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: Looking at the test input's non-default rows (4,9,14,19):\n\nRow 4: 1,1,4,4.\n\nRow 9: same as row 4.\n\nRow 14:8,8,8,8.\n\nRow 19: same as row 14.\n\nSo the non-default values are 1,4,8.\n\nIn the training examples, the outputs include these new numbers. For example, Example 3's output includes 1,2,8. So perhaps the output arrays are capturing these new numbers in some order.\n\nIn the test input, the new numbers are 1,4,8. So the output arrays might be [1,4,8], [1,4,0], [8,8,0], or something similar. But looking at the examples, the outputs often have zeros in some positions. For instance, Example 3's first output line is [1,0,2]. So maybe the first output line captures the first occurrence of new numbers, and zeros fill in if there are fewer.\n\nBut how to structure this into three arrays. \n\nAlternatively, each output array represents the new numbers introduced in different sections of the input. For example:\n\nFirst output line: first new number encountered (1), then next (4), then next (8).\n\nSecond output line: next occurrences.\n\nThird output line: remaining occurrences.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the three unique non-default values present in the input. For the test input, the unique non-default values are 1,4,8. So the outputs could be [1,4,8], [0,0,0], [0,0,0], but this doesn't match the training examples. For example, Example 0's unique non-4 values are 1 and 3, but the output includes three elements. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output arrays correspond to the first three rows in the input that have non-default values, and each output array's elements are the first three non-default values in that row. If a row has fewer than three non-default values, fill with zeros.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's first non-default row (index 5), the non-4 values are at positions 5 (1), 8 (1), 11 (3). So first three non-4 values are 1,1,3. But the output is [1,0,3]. Not sure why the second element is 0. Maybe it's taking every other value. Or maybe the first, third, fifth non-4 values. But position 5:1, position 8:1, position 11:3. So the output is [1,1,3], but the actual output is [1,0,3]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output takes the first, second, and fourth non-default values. For example, in row 5 of Example 0: 1,1,3,3. First three are 1,1,3. But output is [1,0,3]. Maybe the second element is 0 because it's duplicate? Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: The outputs in the examples sometimes have the same number repeated. For example, Example 2's output has [6,6,0] and [3,3,3]. This suggests that the output is capturing the same value across multiple positions. \n\nIn Example 2's input, the non-default rows have 6s and 3s. The first output line [6,6,0] could be from a row with two 6s, and the third element is 0. The third output line [3,3,3] could be from a row with multiple 3s. So perhaps the output captures the first three non-default values in a row, and if there are multiple instances of the same value, they are all included. For example, if a row has 6,6,6, then output [6,6,6], but if it has 6,6, then [6,6,0].\n\nBut this still doesn't explain why some outputs have zeros in the middle.\n\nAnother approach: The output arrays are formed by taking the first three instances of non-default values in the entire input, grouping them into triples. For example, the first three non-default values form the first output array, the next three form the second, and so on. If there are less than three, fill with zeros.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the non-4 values are 1,1,3,3,3, etc. The first three are 1,1,3. So first output array would be [1,1,3]. But the actual output is [1,0,3]. Doesn't match. \n\nAlternatively, the output is taking the first occurrence of each unique non-default value in the order they appear. For Example 0, first unique is 1, then 3. So output is [1,0,3], with 0 as a placeholder. But then the second output array would be the next unique value, but there are none, so [1,0,0]. Not sure.\n\nIn the test input, the first non-2 values are 1, then 4, then 8. So the output would be [1,4,8], then zeros for the remaining arrays. But the training examples have varying structures. Example 3's output has [1,0,2], [0,0,2], [2,2,2], which could be capturing the first occurrence of 1, then 2, then 2 again. But not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps I need to look for a different approach. Let's consider the position of the non-default values. \n\nIn Example 0's first output line [1,0,3], maybe the non-default values are at positions where their indices mod 3 give 0, 1, 2. For example, if the first non-4 is at a position mod 3 ==0, the second mod 3 ==1 (but no, so 0), and third mod 3 ==2 (3). \n\nBut looking at row 5 of Example 0's input: non-4 values at positions 5 (5 mod 3 = 2), 8 (8 mod3=2), 11 (11 mod3=2), 14 (14 mod3=2). All mod3=2. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the non-default values from the columns that are multiples of a certain number. For example, columns 5, 8, 11 in Example 0's row 5. But 5,8,11 are spaced 3 apart. 5,8,11: difference of 3. 5+3=8, 8+3=11. So maybe every third column where the non-default appears. So the output elements are from columns 5,8,11. \n\nIn Example 0's row 5: column 5 is 1, column 8 is 1, column 11 is 3. So the output would be [1,1,3], but the actual output is [1,0,3]. Hmm. If they take the first, then the next after skipping some, but not sure.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the first array is [1,0,3]. If columns 5, 8, 11 are considered, then 5 is 1, 8 is 1, 11 is3. So how to get 0 in the middle. Unless the second element is taken from a different row.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the values from three specific columns across different rows. For example, column 5 from the first non-default row, column 8 from the second, and column 11 from the third. \n\nBut in Example 0's first output line [1,0,3], 1 could be from column 5 of row 5, 0 from column 8 of another row (which might have 4), and 3 from column 11 of row 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are formed by taking the first, fifth, and ninth elements of specific rows. For example, row 5 of Example 0 has elements 4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,1,4,4,3, etc. The first, fifth, ninth elements are 4,4,1. But the output is [1,0,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to look for a different pattern. Let's consider that the output arrays are derived from the non-default rows in the input, and each element in the output array is the sum or product of certain elements in the non-default row.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's row 5: sum of non-4 values is 1+1+3+3=8. But the output is [1,0,3]. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: The output arrays are the first three non-default values from each third of the input's non-default rows. For example, split each non-default row into three parts and take the first non-default value from each part. If a part has no non-default, use zero.\n\nFor Example 0's row 5: length 29. Split into thirds of ~9-10 elements each.\n\nFirst third: positions 0-9. The first non-4 is at 5 (value 1).\n\nSecond third: positions 10-19. The first non-4 is at 11 (value 3).\n\nThird third: positions 20-28. All 4s, so 0.\n\nSo the output array would be [1,3,0], but the actual output is [1,0,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, split each row into three parts, each of 9 elements (assuming 27 elements, but the test input has 29 elements. Not sure.)\n\nAlternatively, split each row into three sections, each with 10 elements (first 10, next 9, last 10). For Example 0's row 5, first 10 elements (0-9): 4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,1,4. First non-4 is 1. Second section (10-18): 4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4. First non-4 is 3. Third section (19-28): 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4. All 4s. So output array [1,3,0]. But Example 0's output is [1,0,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is not working. Maybe I need to think outside the box. \n\nLooking at the outputs for the examples:\n\n- Example 0's outputs are [1,0,3], [1,0,0], [1,0,0].\n- Example 1's outputs are [0,2,0], [2,0,0], [0,0,8].\n- Example 2's outputs are [6,6,0], [0,0,0], [3,3,3].\n- Example 3's outputs are [1,0,2], [0,0,2], [2,2,2].\n\nNoticing that the last element of each output array often corresponds to a new number introduced later in the input. For example, in Example 1, the last output array's last element is 8, which is a new number in the input. Similarly, in Example 3, the last output array is all 2s, which are present in later rows.\n\nMaybe the output is capturing the progression of non-default values as they appear in the input. The first output array represents the first occurrence of new numbers, the second array the next occurrence, and so on. For example:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- First non-4 is 1. Then another 1. Then 3. So first output array is [1,0,3].\n- Second non-default row has 1 and 3 again. So second output array is [1,0,0].\n- Third non-default row has 4 again, so output remains [1,0,0].\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each output array corresponds to a specific \"block\" of the input. For example, the input is structured in blocks of rows, and each block contributes to an output array. \n\nFor Example 0, the input has 28 rows. Divided into three blocks: 9 rows, 9 rows, 10 rows. Each block's output is derived from the non-default rows in that block.\n\nBut how? Let's take Example 0's first block of 9 rows. The non-default rows in this block are row 5 (index 5). The output array [1,0,3] comes from this row. Then the second block's non-default row is row 8, which has non-4 values. But the output is [1,0,0]. Maybe from the first non-default value in that row. \n\nRow 8 (index 8) in Example 0's input is [4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,1,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. The first non-4 is 1. So the output array would be [1,0,0]. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are formed by the first non-default value from each third of the input when divided vertically. For example, each output array is the first non-default from the first, second, and third vertical sections of the input.\n\nFor Example 0's first non-default row (row 5):\n\nFirst third: positions 0-9: first non-4 is at 5 (1).\n\nSecond third: positions 10-19: first non-4 is at 11 (3).\n\nThird third: positions 20-28: all 4s, so 0.\n\nThus output array [1,3,0], but actual output is [1,0,3]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the sections are split differently. Maybe first 10, next 10, last 9.\n\nFirst section: 0-9: non-4 at 5 (1).\n\nSecond section: 10-19: non-4 at 11 (3).\n\nThird section: 20-28: all 4s.\n\nOutput would be [1,3,0]. Actual output is [1,0,3]. Not matching.\n\nBut the actual output is [1,0,3], which suggests that the second element is 0. Maybe the middle section has no non-4 value. But in the second section (10-19), there is a 3 at 11. So this doesn't explain the 0.\n\nThis is quite perplexing. Let's try to think of the output arrays as the non-default values encountered in specific positions across the input rows. For example, the first output element is the first non-default value in the first non-default row, the second output element is the first non-default in the second non-default row, and the third is the first non-default in the third non-default row. If there are fewer non-default rows, fill with zeros.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nFirst non-default row (index 5): first non-4 is 1.\n\nSecond non-default row (index 8): first non-4 is 1.\n\nThird non-default row (index 11): first non-4 is 3.\n\nSo the first output array is [1,1,3]. But the actual output is [1,0,3]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first three unique non-default values in order of appearance. Example 0's unique non-4 values are 1 and 3. So output would be [1,3,0]. But the first output array is [1,0,3]. Not sure.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is formed by taking the first three non-default values from the input, but in the order they appear in the entire input, skipping duplicates. So Example 0's non-4 values are 1,1,3,3, etc. The unique values are 1 and 3. So the output would be [1,3,0], but the first output array is [1,0,3]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for a different approach. Let's consider that each output array is derived from a specific pattern in the input arrays. For example, in the input, whenever there's a row filled with the default value (like all 4s in Example 0), it separates sections. Then, the rows after that filled row have certain non-default values which contribute to the output.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has several rows filled with 4s, acting as separators. Between these filled rows, there are groups of rows. Each group contributes to an output array. For example, between the first and second filled row, there are some non-default rows. The first group of non-default rows contributes to the first output array.\n\nLet's check Example 0's input:\n\n- Rows 0-2: [0,0,4...], then [0,0,4...], then [4,4,4...].\n- Rows 3-5: [0,0,4...], [0,0,4...], [4,4,4...1,4,4,1,4,4,3...].\n- Then another filled row (row 6?), and so on.\n\nWait, the filled rows are the all-4 rows. Each filled row separates sections. So the first section is rows 0-2, then 3-5, then 6-8, etc. \n\nLooking at the first non-filled row after a filled row: row 5 (index 5) is the first non-filled row after a filled row (row 2). This row has non-4 values. Maybe the first output array is derived from this row. Similarly, the next non-filled row after the next filled row (row 8) contributes to the second output array.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\n- Filled rows are at indices 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26.\n\nWait, no. The input lists each array as a line. Looking at Example 0's input:\n\nThe third line (index 2) is all 4s. Then line 5 (index 5) is the first non-filled line after that. So sections are between filled rows.\n\nFor Example 0, the first filled row is line 2. The next filled row is line 5. So the section between them is lines 3-4 (which are all 0s and 4s), but then line 5 is a non-filled row (has 1s and 3s). Then the next filled row is line 8. The section between line 5 and line 8 is lines 6-7, which are 0s and 4s. Then line 8 is a non-filled row again. Wait, this doesn't seem to form sections with non-default values.\n\nAlternatively, the sections are the non-filled rows between filled rows. Each section's non-filled rows contribute to an output array.\n\nBut Example 0's output has three arrays. Let's count the filled rows:\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nLines with all 4s are lines 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26. So between these filled rows, there are groups of non-filled rows. For example:\n\n- Between line 2 and line 5: lines 3-4 are non-filled (0s and 4s).\n- Between line 5 and line 8: lines 6-7 are non-filled.\n- Between line 8 and line 11: lines 9-10 are non-filled.\n- Between line 11 and line 14: lines 12-13 are non-filled.\n- And so on.\n\nBut these groups of lines between filled rows are all 0s and 4s, except for the filled rows. So the only non-filled rows with non-default values are the filled rows themselves. This approach doesn't seem to work.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling to find the pattern, perhaps I should consider that the output is the count of certain patterns in the input. For example, the number of times a non-default value appears in specific positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array corresponds to a different layer or channel in the input, but this seems unlikely.\n\nAnother possibility: The input represents a 3D structure, and the output is slicing through certain dimensions. But without more context, this is hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first three non-default values from the input, each from a different row. For Example 0, the first three non-4 values are from row 5 (1), row 5 again (1), row 5 again (3). So the output arrays would be [1,1,3], but the actual output is different. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the test input. The test input's non-default rows are rows 4,9,14,19,24. Each of these has non-2 values. \n\nRow 4: 1,1,4,4.\n\nRow 9: same as row 4.\n\nRow 14:8,8,8,8.\n\nRow 19: same as row 14.\n\nRow 24: all 2s.\n\nSo the non-default values are 1,4,8. \n\nIn the training examples, each output array seems to capture the first occurrence of new non-default values. For example, in Example 3, the first output array is [1,0,2], where 1 and 2 are new. Then the next arrays have more 2s.\n\nFor the test input, the first non-default value is 1, then 4, then 8. So the output arrays might be:\n\n[1,4,8], [1,4,0], [8,0,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs often have zeros in the middle. For example, Example 0's first output array is [1,0,3]. Maybe the 0 indicates that there's no new value in that position. \n\nAlternatively, the first output array is the first three non-default values encountered, regardless of row. So 1,1,4. But the output requires three elements per array. So first array [1,1,4], second [4,8,8], third zeros. But this doesn't match the examples.\n\nAnother guess: Each output array corresponds to a group of three non-default rows. The first three non-default rows (rows 4,9,14) have values 1,1,8. The output arrays would be [1,1,8], [4,8,0], [8,0,0]. But again, this doesn't match the examples' format.\n\nAlternatively, each output array is formed by taking the first three non-default values from the first three non-default rows. For the test input, rows 4 (1),9 (1),14 (8). So first output array [1,1,8]. But the example outputs have varying structures, and this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are formed by the unique non-default values in the order they appear, padded with zeros. So the test input's unique values are 1,4,8. So the first output array is [1,4,8], the others are zeros. But Example 0's unique values are 1,3, but the output has three arrays. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Given the time I have, I'll make a guess based on the test input's non-default rows and the training examples' patterns. For the test input:\n\nThe non-default rows have values 1,4,8. The first non-default row (row 4) has 1 and 4. The second (row 9) same as row 4. The third (row 14) has 8. \n\nLooking at Example 3's output, which has 1,2,8, the output arrays are [1,0,2], [0,0,2], [2,2,2]. This suggests that each new non-default value is captured in the output arrays, and repeated in subsequent arrays. \n\nSo for the test input, the first non-default value is 1, then 4, then 8. So the output might be:\n\n[1,4,8], [1,4,0], [8,0,0].\n\nBut looking at the examples, the outputs often have three elements with zeros in between. For example, Example 1's first output array is [0,2,0], which may correspond to a row where 2 appears in the middle position. \n\nAlternatively, in the test input's non-default rows, the non-default values are positioned in the fifth element (index 4) of each row. For example, row 4: element 4 is 1, row 9: element 4 is 1, row 14: element 4 is 8. So perhaps the output arrays are formed by taking these values. So first output array is [1,1,8], but the output requires three arrays. Maybe each array corresponds to a group of three rows. \n\nRow 4: 1\n\nRow 9:1\n\nRow 14:8\n\nRow 19:8\n\nRow 24:2 (but it's all 2s, so no non-default).\n\nSo the first three rows give 1,1,8 \u2192 first output array [1,1,8]. Then next three rows (rows 19 and beyond) would be 8,0,0. But this doesn't align with the training examples' structure.\n\nAlternatively, each output array is formed by taking the values from the same position in three consecutive non-default rows. For example, row 4's position 4 is 1, row 9's position 4 is 1, row 14's position 4 is 8. So the output arrays would be [1,1,8], but again, not matching the three output arrays required.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll take a guess based on the test input's non-default values and the examples. The test input has non-default values 1,4,8. The first non-default value is 1, which appears in row 4. The next new value is 4 in the same row. Then 8 in row 14. So the output might be:\n\n[1,4,8]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, like Example 3's outputs are [1,0,2], [0,0,2], [2,2,2], where each subsequent array introduces new values. So perhaps the first output array captures the first three non-default values, but since there are three, but in the test input, the first non-default row has two new values (1,4), the output might be [1,4,0], then the next array [8,0,0], and the third [0,0,0]. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Given that Example 3's first output array is [1,0,2], which captures the first non-default value (1) and then the third non-default value (2), skipping the second, this pattern might be to take the first non-default value from the first non-default row, then the first from the second, etc. For the test input, first three non-default rows are 4,9,14. Their first non-default values are 1,1,8. So the output arrays would be:\n\n[1,1,8]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, considering the test input's rows 4,9,14,19:\n\nRow 4: first non-2 is 1.\n\nRow 9: first non-2 is 1.\n\nRow 14: first non-2 is 8.\n\nRow 19: first non-2 is 8.\n\nSo the first three output arrays would be [1,1,8], [8,0,0], [0,0,0]. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are formed by taking the first three non-default values encountered in the entire input, each forming an array. For the test input:\n\nFirst three non-default values are 1 (row 4), 1 (row 9), 4 (row 4, position 14). So output arrays would be [1,1,4], then next three values (4,8,8), then [8,0,0]. But again, this is a guess.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll proceed with the following output based on the test input's non-default rows and the pattern observed in the examples, particularly Example 3's output where the new values are captured in the output arrays with zeros padding where there are fewer values.\n\nFor the test input:\n\n- The first non-default row (row 4) has 1 and 4. The first three non-2 values are 1,1,4. So first output array: [1,1,4].\n\n- The second non-default row (row 9) has 1 and 4. First three non-2: 1,1,4. Second output array: [1,1,4].\n\n- The third non-default row (row 14) has 8,8,8,8. First three: 8,8,8. Third output array: [8,8,8].\n\nBut looking at Example 3's output, the third array is all 2s. So perhaps when there are multiple instances of the same non-default value, they are filled in the output. \n\nThus, the test output might be:\n\n[1, 4, 0]\n\n[8, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nBut I'm not confident. However, considering the training examples, such as Example 1 where the output has [0,0,8], which captures the 8 from a later row, I'll guess that the test output's first array is [1,4,0], the second [4,8,0], and the third [8,0,0]. But this is a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, the output is:\n\n[1, 0, 4]\n\n[0, 0, 8]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nThis would align with the first non-default values in each third of the first non-default row. But without a clear pattern, this is a guess.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I'll settle on the following output based on the test input's non-default values and the examples' structures:\n\n[1,4,0]\n[8,0,0]\n[0,0,0]",
        "initial_response_1": "[1, 4, 0]  \n[8, 0, 0]  \n[0, 0, 0]",
        "attempt_2": [

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples given.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 0. The input arrays have a lot of 4s and 0s. The output is three arrays: [1,0,3], [1,0,0], [1,0,0]. Hmm. Let me check the input to see where those numbers might come from. \n\nIn Example 0's input, there's a row like [4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,1,4,4,3,...]. Notice that the output elements are 1, 0, 3. Maybe those numbers are taken from specific positions in the input rows. Let's check the positions. For instance, the 5th element (index 5) in that row is 1, then index 8 is 1, index 11 is 3. But the output has three elements. Maybe each output array corresponds to a certain row in the input, picking specific elements.\n\nWait, the outputs for Example 0 are three arrays. Let me count how many rows there are in the input. The input for Example 0 has 27 rows, but the output has three arrays. So maybe the output is summarizing some information from groups of rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array corresponds to the non-zero values in certain rows. Let's look. The first output array in Example 0 is [1,0,3]. Looking at the input rows, perhaps the 5th row (since the output starts after some rows). The 5th row in the input is [4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,1,4,4,3,...]. The non-4 values here are 1,1,3. But the output is [1,0,3]. Hmm. Wait, maybe the positions where the values change from 4 to another number. Let's see: the first occurrence of a non-4 is at position 5 (value 1), then position 8 (value 1), then position 11 (value 3). So maybe taking those values and putting them into the output array. But the output has three elements. Alternatively, maybe the first non-4 value in each relevant row is taken. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the first output array is [1,0,3]. The first non-4 in row 5 is 1. Then the next row (row 6) is all 0s except for 4s, so maybe the 0 comes from there. But the output arrays are of length 3. Wait, maybe each output array is formed by taking certain elements from three consecutive input rows. For instance, the first output array [1,0,3] could be taking the first non-zero (or non-background number) from three rows. Alternatively, maybe looking at the rows that have non-4 numbers and extracting those.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output arrays are the counts of certain numbers. For example, in Example 0, the output [1,0,3] might be the count of 1s, 0s, and 3s in a particular row. But checking row 5 in Example 0: the row has multiple 1s and 3s. For example, the row is [4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,1,4,4,3,4,4,3,...]. So in this row, there are two 1s and two 3s, but the output is [1,0,3]. That doesn't match counts. So maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output arrays are the unique non-4 numbers in each set of three rows. Let's see. For Example 0, the first output is [1,0,3]. Looking at rows 5,6,7. Row 5 has 1 and 3, row 6 has 0 and 4, row 7 has 0 and 4. But combining those, maybe taking the distinct non-4 numbers: 1, 3, 0. But the output is ordered [1,0,3]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the structure of the input. Each example's input seems to have a grid structure. For instance, Example 0's input has rows that alternate between 0s and 4s, and then a row of all 4s, then more 0s and 4s. Maybe this represents a grid where certain cells are highlighted. For example, each group of three rows could form a larger structure, and the output is capturing some transformation of that.\n\nWait, perhaps each group of three rows forms a \"block\", and the output is derived from each block. For example, the first three rows might form a block, then the next three, etc. Let's check Example 0's output. The output has three arrays. The input has 27 rows, so 27/3 = 9 blocks. But the output has three arrays. Maybe each output array corresponds to three blocks? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle row of each block of three rows and extracting certain elements. For example, in Example 0, the 5th row is [4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,1,4,4,3,...]. The non-4 elements here are 1,1,3. The output for the first array is [1,0,3]. Wait, perhaps the first, second, and third non-4 elements in the middle row of each block. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the first output array is [1,0,3]. The middle rows of the first three blocks might be:\n\nBlock 1: rows 0-2. Middle row is row 1, which is all 0,0,4,... so perhaps the middle row is row 2 (all 4s). But output is [1,0,3]. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 1's input. The output is [0,2,0], [2,0,0], [0,0,8]. Let's check the input rows. For example, the first output array [0,2,0] might come from a row with 3s and a 2. For instance, in row 7 of Example 1's input: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,2,...]. The non-3 elements here are 2s. So maybe the output is picking the first, second, and third occurrence of non-background numbers. But how does that lead to [0,2,0]? Maybe the first non-3 is 2, then another 2, but the output is [0,2,0]. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output arrays are formed by looking for the first three numbers in the input rows that are different from the majority (like the background number). For example, in Example 0, the majority number is 4. So in row 5 of Example 0, the first non-4 is 1 (position 5), then another 1 (position 8), then 3 (position 11). So maybe the output takes these three values. The first output array is [1,0,3], which could correspond to these three values. But where does the 0 come from? Maybe in the next row (row 6), which is all 0s except 4s. The first non-4 in row 6 is 0. Then row 7 also has 0s, so the first non-4 is 0. Then row 8 has 1,1,3 again. Wait, but the output arrays for Example 0 are three arrays, each of three elements. So perhaps each output array is derived from three consecutive rows. For example, the first output array [1,0,3] could be the first non-4 from row 5, row 6, row 7. Let's check:\n\nRow 5: first non-4 is 1 (position 5)\nRow 6: first non-4 is 0 (position 0)\nRow 7: first non-4 is 0 (position 0)\nBut the output is [1,0,3], which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays are formed by looking at specific positions in the rows. For instance, in Example 0's output [1,0,3], perhaps the numbers come from positions 5, 8, 11 in the row. Let's check row 5 in Example 0: positions 5 is 1, position 8 is 1, position 11 is 3. But the output is [1,0,3]. So maybe 1 (from position 5), then 0 (from row 6, position 5?), but row 6 is [0,0,4,...], position 5 would be 4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays correspond to the numbers that are not the background (like 4 in Example 0, 3 in Example 1, 1 in Example 2, 8 in Example 3), and they are grouped in triples. For example, in Example 0, the first non-4 numbers in certain rows are 1, then 0, then 3. But how are these grouped into the output arrays?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input. The output is [1,0,2], [0,0,2], [2,2,2]. Let's check the rows. The input has a row like [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,2,...]. The non-8 numbers here are 1,1,2. The output [1,0,2] could be taking 1 from the first occurrence, 0 from another row, and 2 from the third. But this is unclear.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output arrays and see how they relate to the input. For Example 0, the output has three arrays, each with three elements. The first array is [1,0,3]. Let's see where these numbers come from. In the input, the first occurrence of 1 is in row 5, position 5. The next is row 8, position 5 again. Then 3 in row 5, position 11. But how does this form the output?\n\nWait, maybe each output array is formed by taking the first three unique non-background numbers in a certain section. For Example 0, the background is 4. The first output array [1,0,3] could be the first three unique non-4 numbers encountered. Let's check:\n\nIn row 5 (4s and 1,1,3), the non-4s are 1 and 3. Then in row 6, which is 0s and 4s, the non-4 is 0. So combining, the unique numbers are 1,0,3. So the first output array is [1,0,3]. Then the next output array [1,0,0] could be from the next set of rows. Maybe rows 8,9,10. Row 8 has 1,1,3 again (non-4s), row 9 is 0s, so maybe the next unique numbers would be 1 again (but already used?), or perhaps it's taking the same pattern. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output arrays are the minimum, maximum, and sum of certain elements. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3's output [1,0,2], maybe the numbers are derived from the positions where the non-background numbers occur. For example, in the row [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,2,...], the non-8 numbers are 1,1,2. The positions are 7, 11, 15. If we subtract 7 by 7 (the first occurrence), we get 0, which maybe corresponds to the first element. But this is unclear.\n\nAnother angle: The test input. Let's look at it to see if I can find a pattern that matches. The test input has rows with 0s and 2s, and some rows with 2s and 1,4,8, etc. The output needs to be in the same format as the training examples. For example, the test input's 4th row is [2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,4,...]. The non-2 numbers here are 1 and 4. Similarly, another row has 8s. So maybe the output would take those numbers.\n\nLooking at the training examples, each output array seems to capture the distinct non-background numbers from certain rows. For instance, in Example 0's first output [1,0,3], those are the non-4 numbers found in the relevant rows. Similarly, in Example 3's first output [1,0,2], maybe 1 and 2 are the non-8 numbers, and 0 from another row.\n\nPutting this together, perhaps the output arrays are formed by taking the first three unique non-background numbers from specific rows in the input, in the order they appear. The background number is the one that's most frequent (like 4 in Example 0, 3 in Example 1, 1 in Example 2, 8 in Example 3). For each group of three rows, the first output array is the first three unique non-background numbers encountered in those rows.\n\nIn the test input, the background number seems to be 2, as most rows are filled with 2s except some that have 1,4,8. For example, the 4th row has 1 and 4. The 14th row has 8. The 24th row is all 2s again. So the non-2 numbers are 1,4,8.\n\nFollowing the pattern from the training examples, the output arrays would capture these non-2 numbers. For example, the first output array might be [1,4,0], but wait, the first non-2 numbers are 1 and 4 in the 4th row, then 8 in the 14th row. But how are these grouped into three output arrays?\n\nAlternatively, each output array corresponds to a set of three rows where a non-background number appears. Let's check:\n\nIn the test input, the first non-2 number is 1 in row 4. The next non-2 is 4 in the same row. Then row 14 has 8. So the first output array could be [1,4,8]. But the training examples have outputs with three elements each. For instance, in Example 3, the output arrays are [1,0,2], [0,0,2], [2,2,2]. The first array captures the 1 and 2 from the non-8 numbers, and a 0 from a row with 0s. \n\nIn the test input, the rows with non-2 numbers are rows 4 and 14. Let's see:\n\nRow 4: [2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,4,...]. Non-2 numbers are 1,1,4.\nRow 14: [2,2,2,2,8,...]. Non-2 is 8.\nRow 19: [2,2,2,2,8,...]. Non-2 is 8.\nRow 24: all 2s.\n\nSo the non-2 numbers are 1,4,8. Then, perhaps the output arrays would be [1,4,8], followed by others. But the training examples have three output arrays. Let's look again at the examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the output is three arrays. The first is [1,0,3], then [1,0,0], then [1,0,0]. This suggests that the first array captures the unique non-background numbers from the first set of relevant rows, and subsequent arrays may have repeated elements or zeros.\n\nBut in the test input, maybe the output would have three arrays. The first array could be [1,4,8], the next [8,0,0], and the third [0,0,0], but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each output array corresponds to a section of the input where the non-background numbers appear. For instance, the first three non-background numbers are 1,4,8, so the first output array is [1,4,8], then the next arrays might be [0,0,0] if there are no more new numbers, but in the test input, 8 appears again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking back at the training examples, each output array has three elements. For example, in Example 0, the first output array is [1,0,3]. Let's see if these correspond to three consecutive non-background numbers in specific positions. Maybe in the input rows, the first non-background number in each of three consecutive rows. For example:\n\nIn Example 0, row 5's first non-4 is 1, row 6's first non-4 is 0, row 7's first non-4 is 0. So the output would be [1,0,0]. But the first output is [1,0,3]. This doesn't fit. So maybe another pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the output arrays are the three unique non-background numbers in the entire input. For Example 0, the non-4 numbers are 1,0,3. So output arrays list these. But why are there three output arrays then? Each output array is the same set of numbers in different orders? No, in Example 0, the outputs are [1,0,3], then [1,0,0], etc. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each output array corresponds to a triplet of rows, and in each triplet, the non-background numbers are extracted. For instance, in Example 0's input, the first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,4,0,0,4,...]\nRow 1: same as row 0.\nRow 2: all 4s.\n\nThe output for the first triplet would be [0,0,4], but the first output array is [1,0,3]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Look at the positions of the non-background numbers. For Example 0, the first non-4 in the input is at row 0, position 2 (value 4). Wait, no. The first non-4 in row 0 is 0. Hmm. Maybe the output is formed by looking for the first three occurrences of non-background numbers in the entire input. For Example 0, the first three non-4 numbers are 0,0,0 (from the first rows), but the output starts with 1. That doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output arrays are formed by taking the numbers from specific positions in the input rows. For example, in each row, the 5th, 8th, and 11th elements. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's row 5: positions 5 is 1, 8 is 1, 11 is 3. So [1,1,3]. But the output is [1,0,3]. Doesn't match. However, if we take those positions but from three consecutive rows:\n\nRow 5: 5th element is 1, row 6: 5th is 4 (but maybe 0?), wait row 6 is [0,0,4,0,0,4,...], so position 5 is 4 (since index starts at 0?), but the fifth element would be index 4. Let me count:\n\nRow 5 in Example 0: [4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,1,4,4,3,...]. The fifth element (index 4) is 4, index 5 is 1. So maybe positions 5, 8, 11. For row 5: 1,1,3. For row 6: 0,0,4. For row 7:0,0,4. So combining these, maybe the first output array is the first elements from each of these rows' positions. But it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array is formed by taking the first three non-background numbers in a certain column. For example, in Example 0, column 5 has 4,4,1,4,4, etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Let's try to find a common pattern across all examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the output is three arrays: [1,0,3], [1,0,0], [1,0,0]. The input has rows with 4s and 0s, and some rows with 1 and 3. The output arrays seem to take the first non-4 numbers from certain rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the output is [0,2,0], [2,0,0], [0,0,8]. The input has rows with 3s and some 2s and 8s. The first output array [0,2,0] might be taking 0 (from rows with 0s and 3s), then 2 from a row with 2s, then 0 again.\n\nIn Example 3, the output is [1,0,2], [0,0,2], [2,2,2]. The input has 8s and some 1s and 2s. The first output array has 1 (from a row with 1), 0 (from a row with 0s), and 2 (from a row with 2).\n\nSo perhaps each output array is formed by taking the first non-background number from three consecutive rows. For example:\n\n- For the first output array, take the first non-background number from row X, row X+1, row X+2.\n- Then for the next array, row X+3, X+4, X+5, etc.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to start from.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the first output array is [1,0,3]. Let's find the rows where these numbers are the first non-background (4) in their respective rows.\n\n- Row 5: first non-4 is 1 at position 5.\n- Row 6: first non-4 is 0 at position 0.\n- Row 7: first non-4 is 0 at position 0.\nBut the output is [1,0,3]. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Unless the third number comes from row 8. Row 8 has first non-4 as 1 again. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output arrays are derived from the middle rows of each block of three rows. For example, in Example 0, the input has rows arranged in groups of three, and the middle row of each group is the one with non-background numbers. For instance:\n\nGroup 1: rows 0-2. Middle row is row 1 (all 0s and 4s), but the first non-4 is 0.\nGroup 2: rows 3-5. Middle row is row 4 (all 0s and 4s), first non-4 is 0.\nGroup 3: rows 6-8. Middle row is row 7 (all 0s and 4s), first non-4 is 0.\nBut the output arrays don't start with 0s.\n\nThis isn't matching up. \n\nAnother observation: The number of output arrays in each example is three. Example 0 has three output arrays, Example 1 has three, and so on. Maybe each output array corresponds to a vertical slice of the input grid. For instance, if the input is a 2D grid, the output arrays are taking three vertical columns and listing the first non-background numbers in those columns.\n\nFor Example 0's input, if it's a 27-row grid, perhaps each output array corresponds to a vertical column's first three non-4 numbers. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays might be the result of some arithmetic or logical operation on the input rows. For instance, XOR or sum of certain elements. But I don't see an obvious pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the output arrays in Example 0: [1,0,3], [1,0,0], [1,0,0]. The first element of each output array is 1, then 1, then 1. The second element is 0 each time. The third element is 3, then 0s. Maybe the first output array is the first occurrence of each unique non-background number, and the subsequent arrays are fillers with zeros. But in Example 1's output, the third array is [0,0,8], which captures the 8 from the input.\n\nAnother idea: Each output array represents a triplet of non-background numbers found in specific positions in the input. For example, the first output array in Example 0 has 1,0,3. These could be the first three different non-4 numbers encountered in the input. The second and third arrays then repeat the first one's numbers but with zeros. But in Example 1, the first output array is [0,2,0], which includes 0 (from rows with 0s) and 2 (from rows with 2s), then the third array has 8.\n\nIn the test input, the non-2 numbers are 1,4,8. So the output might be three arrays: [1,4,8], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]. But looking at the training examples, the outputs sometimes have zeros in the second and third positions. \n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are formed by taking the first three non-background numbers found in the entire input, and then padding with zeros if there are fewer than three. For example, in Example 0, the non-4 numbers are 1,0,3. So the first output array is [1,0,3], and the next arrays are [1,0,0] perhaps because there are no new numbers. But this doesn't fit Example 1's output, which has 0,2,0, then 2,0,0, then 0,0,8. That suggests that the output arrays are capturing three different triplets of numbers from different sections of the input.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make a hypothesis: The output arrays are formed by taking the first three non-background numbers encountered in three different sections of the input. For example, each output array corresponds to a block of rows, and within each block, the first three non-background numbers are taken. The background number is the one that's repeated most in the input.\n\nIn the test input, the background is 2. The first non-2 numbers are 1,4 in row 4, and 8 in row 14. So the first output array would be [1,4,8]. The next blocks may not have new numbers, so the next output arrays might be [0,0,0], but looking at the training examples, they sometimes repeat numbers. \n\nBut the training examples show that the output arrays can have zeros. For instance, in Example 0's second output array [1,0,0], which suggests that only the first non-background number is taken from that block, and the rest are zeros.\n\nPutting it all together, for the test input, the non-2 numbers are 1,4,8. So the first output array would be [1,4,8]. The next output array might be [8,0,0] if the next block has 8 as the only non-2 number. The third output array might be [0,0,0] if there are no new numbers. However, looking at the test input, there are multiple occurrences of 1,4,8. For example, row 4 has 1 and 4, row 14 has 8, row 19 has 8 again, and row 24 is all 2s.\n\nBut the training examples sometimes have multiple output arrays with the same numbers. For instance, Example 3's output has [2,2,2] as the third array. So maybe after capturing the unique numbers, subsequent arrays are filled with the last number.\n\nIn the test input, the first output array would be [1,4,8]. The next array might be [0,0,0] because the next blocks have only 2s. But there's row 14 and 19 with 8. So perhaps the second output array is [8,0,0], and the third is [0,0,0].\n\nBut I'm not confident. Looking at Example 3's output, the third array is [2,2,2], which matches the non-background number 2 appearing in multiple positions. So maybe after the unique numbers are captured, the output arrays fill with the last found number. \n\nGiven all this, I'll venture that the test output should be:\n\n[1,4,8]\n[8,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, each output array is three elements, and in the examples, sometimes zeros are filled. For example, in Example 0, the second and third output arrays are [1,0,0] and [1,0,0]. So perhaps after the initial unique numbers, the remaining arrays have the first number followed by zeros.\n\nAlternatively, in Example 3's output, the third array is [2,2,2], which might be from a row where the non-8 numbers are all 2s. So maybe each output array corresponds to a row with non-background numbers, taking the first three occurrences, and padding with zeros if necessary.\n\nIn the test input, the first row with non-2 numbers is row 4: [2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,4,...]. The non-2 numbers are 1,1,4. So the first output array would be [1,1,4], but the training examples show that duplicates are not included. For example, in Example 0's row 5, there are two 1s, but the output array is [1,0,3]. So perhaps duplicates are skipped.\n\nSo in the test input, row 4's non-2 numbers are 1 and 4. The first three unique are 1,4, then row 14 has 8. So the first output array would be [1,4,8]. The next array would look at the next set of non-2 numbers, which might be 8 again in row 19, leading to [8,0,0]. The third array would be [0,0,0] if there are no more new numbers.\n\nBut in Example 3, the third array is [2,2,2], suggesting that if there's a row with multiple instances of a non-background number, they are filled into the output array. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output arrays are the first three unique non-background numbers encountered in the input, followed by zeros or repeated numbers. For the test input, the non-2 numbers are 1,4,8. So the first output array is [1,4,8], the next arrays might be [0,0,0] but according to the training examples, there might be more. However, looking at the examples, the outputs often have three arrays, each with three elements. For the test input, perhaps the output is:\n\n[1,4,8]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut Example 3's output has three arrays with varying elements, so this might not be correct. Alternatively, the test input's output could be:\n\n[1,4,8]\n[8,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut I need to ensure consistency with the training examples. \n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the output arrays' lengths. In the training examples, each output array has three elements. For the test input, there are three output arrays. Let's see:\n\nTest input has 27 rows. Divided into three sections of 9 rows each. Each section's output array is formed by taking the first three unique non-background numbers. \n\nIn the first 9 rows of the test input, the non-2 numbers are 1 and 4 in row 4. So the first output array might be [1,4,0]. But that doesn't fit the pattern. \n\nAlternatively, in each group of three rows, the first non-background number is taken. For example:\n\nRows 0-2: all 0s and 2s. No non-2 numbers.\nRows 3-5: row 4 has 1 and 4. So first non-2 is 1. Then row 5 is all 2s except 0s. So first non-2 is 0. Then row 6: all 0s and 2s. So first non-2 is 0. So the first output array would be [1,0,0].\n\nRows 6-8: row 6 has 0s and 2s, first non-2 is 0. Row 7: same. Row 8: same. Output [0,0,0].\n\nRows 9-11: row 9 is 2s and 0s. Row 10: same. Row 11: row 9 is [2,2,2,2,1,...], but wait, row 9 in the test input is [0,0,0,0,2,...], no, the test input's rows are:\n\nTest input rows (starting from 0):\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,2,...]\nRow 1: same as row 0.\nRow 2: same.\nRow 3: same.\nRow 4: [2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,4,...]\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,2,...]\nRow 6: same.\nRow 7: same.\nRow 8: same.\nRow 9: [2,2,2,2,1,...] (similar to row 4)\nRow 10: [0,0,0,0,2,...]\nRow 11: same.\nRow 12: same.\nRow 13: same.\nRow 14: [2,2,2,2,8,...]\nRow 15: [0,0,0,0,2,...]\nRow 16: same.\nRow 17: same.\nRow 18: same.\nRow 19: [2,2,2,2,8,...]\nRow 20: [0,0,0,0,2,...]\nRow 21: same.\nRow 22: same.\nRow 23: same.\nRow 24: [2,2,2,2,2,...]\nRow 25: [0,0,0,0,2,...]\nRow 26: same.\n\nSo the non-2 numbers are in rows 4,9,14,19. \n\nRow 4: 1 and 4.\nRow 9: 1 and 4.\nRow 14:8.\nRow 19:8.\n\nSo the first non-2 numbers in each group of three rows:\n\nGroup 0-2: rows 0-2. All 0s and 2s. First non-2 is 0.\n\nGroup 3-5: rows 3-5. Row 4 is first non-2 at position 4 (1). So the first non-2 in this group is 1.\n\nGroup 6-8: rows 6-8. All 0s and 2s. First non-2 is 0.\n\nGroup 9-11: row 9 has non-2 numbers 1 and 4. First is 1.\n\nGroup 12-14: row 14 has 8. First non-2 is 8.\n\nGroup 15-17: rows 15-17. All 0s and 2s. First non-2 is 0.\n\nGroup 18-20: row 19 has 8. First non-2 is 8.\n\nGroup 21-23: rows 21-23. All 0s and 2s. First non-2 is 0.\n\nGroup 24-26: rows 24-26. All 2s except row 24 which is all 2s. First non-2 is none, so maybe 0.\n\nNow, the output requires three arrays. Each array has three elements, likely corresponding to three groups. For example:\n\nFirst output array: groups 0-2,3-5,6-8 \u2192 elements [0,1,0]\n\nSecond output array: groups9-11,12-14,15-17 \u2192 [1,8,0]\n\nThird output array: groups18-20,21-23,24-26 \u2192 [8,0,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' format. Alternatively, each output array corresponds to one group of three rows, taking the first three non-background numbers in that group. However, many groups have only one or no non-background numbers.\n\nThis approach might not fit the training examples either. \n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think the safest bet is to look for the non-background numbers in the test input and list them in the order they appear, forming three arrays of three elements each. The background is 2, so non-2 numbers are 1,4,8. The first output array would be [1,4,8]. The next arrays might be [0,0,0] if no more new numbers, but according to the training examples, there might be repetition. Example 3's third array is [2,2,2], which is the non-background number appearing multiple times. So perhaps for the test input, after the first array, the next arrays are filled with the last non-background number. So:\n\n[1,4,8]\n[8,0,0]\n[8,0,0]\n\nAlternatively, based on Example 3's output where the third array is [2,2,2], which is the non-background number of 8, but in that example, the non-8 numbers include 1 and 2. So maybe in the test input, after the unique numbers are listed, the remaining arrays are filled with the last non-background number. So the test output would be:\n\n[1,4,8]\n[8,0,0]\n[8,0,0]\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. However, this aligns with how Example 3's third array is all 2s, which was a non-background number appearing in later rows. So perhaps the test output is:\n\n[1,4,8]\n[8,0,0]\n[8,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the test input's row 19 and 14, which have 8, and row 24 has all 2s. The last non-background number is 8, so the third array might be [8,0,0] or [8,8,8]. \n\nBut Example 3's third array is [2,2,2], which corresponds to a row filled with 2s (non-background for that example). So in the test input, the last output array might be [2,2,2], but the background is 2, so that's unlikely. Wait, no. In Example 3, the background is 8, and the third output array is [2,2,2], which are non-8 numbers. So for the test input's third array, if there's a row filled with 8s, but in the test input, the last rows are all 2s. So the third array would not be filled with 8s. \n\nThis is quite confusing. Given the time constraints and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the test output is:\n\n[1,4,8]\n[8,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut given that the third array in Example 3 is [2,2,2], perhaps the test input's third array is [8,8,8], but I don't see any row in the test input with multiple 8s except rows 14 and 19. However, those rows have 8 only once. \n\nAlternatively, the third array could be [0,0,0] as there are no new non-2 numbers. Given that, I'll settle on the following answer based on the first three unique non-2 numbers and padding with zeros:\n\n[1,4,8]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nBut looking back at Example 0's output, the first array is [1,0,3], which includes a 0 from a row with 0s. So maybe the test input's first array is [1,0,4], where 0 comes from rows with 0s. However, in the test input's row 4, the non-2 numbers are 1 and 4. The rows before that (rows 0-3) have 0s and 2s, so the first non-2 numbers are 0s. \n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Let's try one last approach: The output arrays are formed by taking the first three non-background numbers from the entire input, in the order they appear, and each output array corresponds to a triplet of these numbers. \n\nIn the test input, the non-2 numbers appear in the following order:\n\nRow 4:1,4\nRow 9:1,4\nRow 14:8\nRow 19:8\n\nSo the first three non-2 numbers are 1,4,8. So the first output array is [1,4,8]. The next three would be 1,4,8 again (from row 9), but since they are duplicates, maybe the output arrays are padded with zeros. Hence, the second output array could be [0,0,0], third [0,0,0]. \n\nBut in Example 0, the first output array is [1,0,3], which includes a 0 from a row with 0s, which are non-background numbers. So perhaps in the test input, the rows with 0s (non-2) contribute 0s to the output. \n\nThe test input's rows 0-3 are all 0s and 2s. The first non-2 numbers are 0s. So the order of non-2 numbers is 0,0,0 (rows 0-3), then 1,4 (row4), then 0s again (rows5-8), then 1,4 (row9), then 0s (rows10-13), then 8 (row14), etc.\n\nSo the first three non-2 numbers are 0,0,0. Then 1,4,8. But the first output array in Example 0 starts with 1, which is a later non-background number. So this approach doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll go with the following:\n\nThe output arrays are formed by taking the first three unique non-background numbers in the input. For the test input, these are 1,4,8. Then, subsequent arrays are filled with zeros. So the output is:\n\n[1,4,8]\n[0,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nHowever, looking at the training examples, such as Example 3's output [2,2,2], which comes from a row where the non-background number is 2 (but Example 3's background is 8), I'm not confident. \n\nAnother possibility: Each output array corresponds to a row in the input that contains non-background numbers. For example, in Example 0, row 5 has 1,1,3. The first output array is [1,0,3], where 1 and 3 are from row5, and 0 from row6. The second output array [1,0,0] comes from row8 (1), row9 (0), row10 (0). The third array [1,0,0] from row12 (1), row13 (0), row14 (0).\n\nApplying this to the test input: \n\nThe rows with non-2 numbers are row4, row9, row14, row19.\n\nRow4: 1,4\nRow9:1,4\nRow14:8\nRow19:8\n\nAssuming each output array is formed by three consecutive such rows:\n\nFirst output array: row4, row9, row14 \u2192 non-2 numbers are 1,4,8 \u2192 [1,4,8]\n\nSecond output array: row19, and the next rows (which are all 2s) \u2192 8,0,0 \u2192 [8,0,0]\n\nThird output array: all zeros \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[1,4,8]\n[8,0,0]\n[0,0,0]\n\nThis aligns with Example 3's output, where the third array is [2,2,2], which comes from a row filled with 2s (non-background for that example), but in the test input, the last rows are all 2s (background) and 0s. So perhaps the third array would be [0,0,0].\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer for the test input is:\n\n[1,4,8]\n[8,0,0]\n[0,0,0]",
