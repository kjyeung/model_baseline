        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a 10x10 grid of numbers, mostly zeros, with some non-zero numbers in certain positions. The output is another grid where most of the elements are 3, except for some regions that seem to correspond to the non-zero numbers from the input but expanded or transformed somehow.\n\nLet's start with Example 0. The input has a small cluster of 4s and 2 in the middle. The output replaces all zeros with 3s and the original 4s and 2 become 4s in a diamond-like shape. Wait, the original input's 4 and 2 are in positions like (3,4), (3,5), (4,2), etc. The output has a larger area of 4s around those positions, maybe expanding each non-zero number into a cross or diamond shape.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has numbers 2, 6, and 6. The output has 6s forming a sort of vertical line. The original 6 in the input is at (3,3) and (4,3), and the output creates a vertical line of 6s around there. Similarly, the 2s might be part of the transformation, but maybe the highest number takes precedence?\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the 6s are prominent, and the 2s are replaced. But the output's 6 regions are more spread out. Hmm. Let's check another example. Example 3's input has 8s and a 2. The output has 8s forming a sort of 'T' shape. The original 8s in the input are in a row, and the output adds a vertical line below, making a T. The 2 is replaced by 8s as well, maybe because it's adjacent to the 8s?\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is taking each non-zero number and creating a cross (horizontal and vertical) around it, but with some exceptions. Alternatively, it could be that each non-zero cell in the input is the center of a cross-shaped region in the output, with the same number as the center. But in Example 0, the original 4s and 2s become all 4s. Wait, in the input of Example 0, there's a 4 and a 2 adjacent. In the output, the 2 is replaced by 4. So maybe the highest number in a certain area takes over?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is creating a kind of \"aura\" around each non-zero cell. For example, each non-zero cell in the input causes a cross (up, down, left, right) around it to be filled with the same number in the output. But then overlapping auras from higher numbers might overwrite lower ones.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 4s and 2 are adjacent. The output has 4s in a larger area. So perhaps any cell adjacent (including diagonally?) to a non-zero cell in the input gets that number in the output, but if there are multiple numbers, the highest one takes precedence. But how do the zeros in the input become 3s in the output? Wait, the output grids are all 3s except for the regions derived from the non-zero input cells.\n\nSo the general pattern might be: the output is filled with 3s, except for areas around each non-zero input cell. Each non-zero cell in the input creates a cross-shaped area (possibly of certain size) around it in the output, filled with the same number. If multiple non-zero cells' areas overlap, the highest number among them takes precedence.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output: The 4s and 2 in the input are transformed into a diamond-shaped area of 4s. So maybe the pattern is that each non-zero cell creates a diamond (Manhattan distance) of radius 2 or something. Wait, let's check the positions. For example, in the input of Example 0, the center is at (3,4) with 4, (3,5) with 2, and (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) with 4s and 2. The output has 4s in a cross that extends two cells in each direction? Or perhaps each non-zero cell in the input creates a plus sign (up, down, left, right) of certain length, and overlapping areas take the maximum value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a dilation of the non-zero regions from the input, using a cross-shaped kernel. For instance, each non-zero cell in the input is the center of a cross (up, down, left, right) and all those cells in the output take the value of the input cell. But overlapping cells take the maximum value. And all other cells are 3.\n\nLet me check the examples again. In Example 1's input, there are 2,6,6, etc. The output has 6s forming a vertical line. The input's 6s are in (3,4) and (4,4). The output has 6s in columns 4 and 5 of row 3, 4, etc. Wait, perhaps each non-zero cell in the input is expanded to a vertical and horizontal line of the same number in the output, covering all cells in the same row and column as the original cell. So for each non-zero cell at (i,j), the output's row i and column j are filled with that number, but where multiple numbers overlap, the highest one is chosen. Then, all other cells are 3.\n\nWait, that could explain the examples. Let's test this hypothesis with Example 0. The input has a cell at (3,4) with 4, (3,5) with 2, (4,2) with 4, etc. Then, the output's row 3 and column 4 would be filled with 4s (since 4 is higher than 2). Similarly, row 3, column 5 would be 2, but if there's a higher number in that row or column, it would take precedence. Wait, but in the output for Example 0, the 4s form a cross. For example, the output row 3 has 3s except for columns 4 and 5. Hmm, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps each non-zero cell in the input creates a plus sign (up, down, left, right) of length 1 around it. So for each non-zero cell, the cell itself and the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are filled with that number. Then, if multiple numbers are in overlapping regions, the highest number takes precedence. The rest are 3s.\n\nWait, let's check Example 0. The input has a 4 at (4,2). In the output, that would create a cross: (4,2), (3,2), (5,2), (4,1), (4,3). But in the output, row 4 has 3s except for columns 2-5. Hmm, maybe it's a larger cross. For example, extending two cells in each direction. Let me see:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 4s form a diamond shape. For example, in row 3 of the output (which is index 3, 0-based?), the 4 starts at column 4 and 5. Then row 4 has 4s from column 2 to 5. So maybe each non-zero cell in the input creates a diamond-shaped area with Manhattan distance of 1. Wait, but Manhattan distance of 1 would be a cross of 5 cells. But in Example 0's output, the 4s spread wider. Alternatively, maybe each non-zero cell is the center of a cross that extends two cells in each direction. So, for a cell (i,j), the output would set (i-2,j), (i-1,j), (i,j), (i+1,j), (i+2,j) and similarly for columns, maybe. But then how to handle edges.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by, for each non-zero cell in the input, coloring all cells in the same row and column as that cell with the same number. But that would fill entire rows and columns. But in the examples, that's not happening. For example, in Example 0's input, the 4 in (4,2) would fill row 4 and column 2. But in the output, row 4 has 4s from columns 2-5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is a result of applying a dilation with a cross-shaped structuring element. For example, each non-zero cell in the input is expanded to a cross of a certain size (e.g., 3x3 cross), and the maximum value in the neighborhood is taken. But the examples show that the output's non-3 areas are larger than just 3x3.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input: The input has an 8 at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and (5,5). The output has a T-shape. The output row 4 has 8s in columns 3-5. Row 5 has 8 in column 5. Row 6 has 8 in column 5. Then row 7 has 8s in columns 3-5. Hmm. Maybe each non-zero cell in the input creates a vertical line (same column) extending two cells up and down, and a horizontal line (same row) extending two cells left and right. So each cell becomes a cross of 5 cells (up two, down two, left two, right two). But then overlapping areas would take the maximum value. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the cell (4,4) is a 4. So in the output, the cross would be rows 2-6 in column 4, and columns 2-6 in row 4. But the output's column 4 in rows 3-5 are 4s, and row 4's columns 2-5 are 4s. Hmm, maybe the cross is 3 cells in each direction. Wait, maybe it's a diamond shape where the Manhattan distance from the original cell is <= 2. So for each non-zero cell (i,j), all cells (x,y) where |x-i| + |y-j| <= 2 are set to that cell's value, unless a higher value is present. Then, the rest are 3s.\n\nLet's check Example 0. The cell (4,4) with value 4 would create a diamond around it. The Manhattan distance of 2 would include cells from row 2-6 and columns 2-6 (but varying). The output's 4s form a diamond shape centered at (4,4). Similarly, the cell (3,5) with 2 would create a diamond around it, but since 4 is higher, those cells are overwritten. So the highest value in overlapping areas takes precedence.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 6 in (3,4) and (4,4). The diamonds around these cells would cover more cells, but since 6 is the highest, those areas become 6. The 2s in the input would create their own diamonds, but since 6 is higher, they are overwritten.\n\nIn Example 3, the input's 8s create diamonds that form a T-shape. For example, the cell (4,3) (assuming rows and columns start at 0?), but maybe rows are 0-indexed. Wait, the input in Example 3 has a row with 8,8,8 at row 4 (assuming 0-based), columns 3-5. So each of these 8s would create diamonds. The overlapping diamonds would form a larger structure. The cell (5,5) is 8, which would create a diamond around it. The output's row 7 (3-based?) has 8s in columns 3-5, which might come from the 8 in row 4, column 5. So if the Manhattan distance is 3, maybe. Wait, perhaps the distance is 3. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero cell in the input creates a cross of a certain length, say, 3 cells in each direction. But how?\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to formalize the possible steps:\n\n1. The output is initialized to all 3s.\n2. For each cell in the input that is non-zero:\n   a. Determine a region around that cell (like a cross or diamond shape).\n   b. For each cell in that region, if the current output cell's value is less than the input cell's value, set it to the input cell's value.\n3. After processing all input cells, the output is the result.\n\nSo the key is to figure out the shape of the region around each non-zero input cell.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, the 4s and 2s create a diamond shape in the output. The output's 4 region covers cells where the Manhattan distance from the original 4s is up to 2. For example, the center cell (4,4) (assuming 0-based) would have Manhattan distance 0. Then, cells within distance 2 would form a diamond of radius 2. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 4s are in rows 3-5 and columns 2-6. For the cell (4,4), Manhattan distance 2 would include cells from (2,4), (4,2), (6,4), (4,6), etc., but perhaps the actual radius is 1. Wait, maybe the region is a cross of 3x3. For example, each non-zero cell affects cells in a 3x3 cross (the cell itself, up, down, left, right). Then, overlapping crosses would merge. But in Example 0, the cross from (4,4) would affect cells (4,4), (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5). But in the output, the cross is larger. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the region is a diamond of radius 1, which is a cross of 5 cells. But again, Example 0's output has a larger area. Maybe the radius is 2. Let's calculate:\n\nThe Manhattan distance for radius 2 would include all cells (i,j) where |i - x| + |j - y| <= 2, where (x,y) is the original cell. So for (4,4), the diamond would cover:\n\n- (4,4) (distance 0)\n- (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5) (distance 1)\n- (2,4), (4,2), (6,4), (4,6), (3,3), (3,5), (5,3), (5,5) (distance 2)\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 4s cover a diamond shape that includes these cells. Let's check:\n\nIn the output of Example 0, the 4s are in:\n\nRow 3: columns 4 and 5 (but according to the Manhattan distance, row 3, column 4 would be distance 1 from (4,4). Wait, maybe the input is 0-based. Let's assume rows and columns start at 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 4 is at row 3 (since the first three rows are all zeros, then row 3 has the first non-zero at column 4). Wait, the input's first three rows are all zeros. Then row 3 (0-based index 3) is [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So the cell (3,4) is 4. Then, applying a Manhattan distance of 2 around (3,4) would include:\n\n- Rows 1 to 5, columns 2 to 6. But the output's 4s are in row 3, columns 4-5; row 4, columns 2-5; row 5, columns 4-5. Hmm, this doesn't exactly match a Manhattan distance of 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero cell creates a cross that extends two cells in each direction. For example, for cell (i,j), set cells (i-2,j), (i-1,j), (i,j), (i+1,j), (i+2,j), and similarly for columns. So for a vertical line and a horizontal line each 5 cells long. Then overlapping areas from multiple cells would merge. \n\nLooking at Example 0's input cell (3,4) (0-based), the vertical line would cover rows 1,2,3,4,5. The horizontal line would cover columns 2,3,4,5,6. So the cross would be all cells in row 3 from column 2-6, and all cells in column 4 from row 1-5. The intersection is cell (3,4). In the output of Example 0, row 3 has 4s in columns 4 and 5. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a cross of 3 cells in each direction. So for cell (i,j), cells (i-1,j), (i,j), (i+1,j) and (i,j-1), (i,j), (i,j+1). That's a plus shape of 5 cells. Then, if a cell is in multiple such regions, the highest value is taken.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the cell (3,4) (4) would generate a plus shape around it. The output would have 4s in (3,4) and adjacent cells. But in the output, the 4s are spread wider, so perhaps this isn't the case.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that each non-zero cell in the input creates a square of size 3x3 centered at the cell, filled with the cell's value, but overlapping regions take the higher value. Let's check Example 0:\n\nOriginal cell (3,4) with 4: 3x3 square would cover rows 2-4, columns 3-5. Similarly, cell (3,5) with 2 would cover rows 2-4, columns 4-6. The overlap would have 4s from the first square. But the output in Example 0 has 4s in row 3, columns 4-5 (from both squares), row 4, columns 2-5 (from cell (4,2) and others). Hmm, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, the non-3 regions seem to form shapes that are connected and symmetrical in some way. For Example 0, the output's 4s form a diamond. For Example 3, the output's 8s form a T-shape. Maybe the transformation involves mirroring or expanding the input's non-zero regions in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking each non-zero input cell and generating a \"bloom\" around it, where each cell in the output is the maximum of the input cells in a certain neighborhood. For example, for each output cell (i,j), if any input cell within a certain distance (like Manhattan distance 2) has a non-zero value, the output cell is the maximum of those values. Otherwise, it's 3.\n\nIf this is the case, then the output is a dilation of the input's non-zero areas, with a structuring element of Manhattan distance <= 2, and the dilation takes the maximum value in the neighborhood. All other cells are 3.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example 0. The input has a cluster of 4s and a 2. The output's 4s are in the area where any input cell within Manhattan distance 2 has a value. The maximum in that neighborhood would be 4, so the output cell becomes 4. The 2 is adjacent to 4s, so its neighborhood would include 4s, hence the output cell becomes 4.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 6s and 2s. The output's 6s are where the neighborhood includes 6, and the 2s are overwritten by higher numbers.\n\nIn Example 3's input, the 8s would have a larger neighborhood, causing the output to have 8s in a T-shape, as the dilation captures cells within Manhattan distance 2 from any 8.\n\nIf this is the case, then the structuring element is a diamond (Manhattan distance <=2) for dilation, and the output is the maximum value in that neighborhood for each cell, with 3 as the default.\n\nSo, applying this to the test input. The test input has:\n\nRow 3 (0-based) column 4: 1\n\nRow 4, columns 4,5: 1,1\n\nRow 4, column 6: 2\n\nRow 5, column 5:1\n\nRow 5, column 6:2\n\nSo for each cell in the output, we look at all input cells within Manhattan distance 2. The output cell will be the maximum value among those input cells, or 3 if none.\n\nFor example, the cell at (3,4) (input 1) will have a neighborhood including itself. The maximum here is 1. But wait, the output requires that. However, in the training examples, all the output's non-3 cells are the same as the input's non-zero cells. Wait, no. In Example 0's output, the non-3 cells are 4, which matches the input's highest value in their neighborhood. So, the output is the maximum value in the Manhattan distance <=2 neighborhood of the input. So, in the test input, any cell that has at least one non-zero input cell within Manhattan distance 2 will take the maximum of those values. Otherwise, it's 3.\n\nSo for the test input's cell (3,4) (input 1), the neighborhood includes the 1 at (3,4), and possibly the 1s at (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), and the 2s at (4,6) and (5,6). The Manhattan distance from (3,4) to (4,6) is (1)+(2)=3, which is beyond the radius of 2. So the maximum in the neighborhood would be 1. But according to the training examples, the output's non-3 cells are the same as the input's numbers. But in Example 0's output, the 4 is spread to a larger area because those cells are within the Manhattan distance of 2 from the original 4s.\n\nWait, let's take a specific example. In Example 0's input, the cell (3,4) is 4. The output cell (3,5) is 4. The Manhattan distance between (3,4) and (3,5) is 1, which is <=2. So the output cell (3,5) would take the maximum value in its neighborhood, which includes the 4 and the 2. So the maximum is 4, hence 4 in the output.\n\nIn the test input, the cell (3,4) has value 1. The cells around it within Manhattan distance 2 would include:\n\nRows from 1 to 5 (since 3-2=1, 3+2=5) and columns from 2 to 6 (4-2=2, 4+2=6). So in this area, the input cells are:\n\nRow 3, column 4: 1\n\nRow 4, columns 4 and 5: 1,1\n\nRow 5, column 5:1\n\nAlso, in row 4, column 6: 2 (distance from (3,4) is 1 (row) + 2 (column) =3, which is outside the radius). So within the radius of 2, the maximum value is 1.\n\nSo output cell (3,4) would be 1. But according to the training examples, the output's non-3 regions are filled with the same number as the input's, but in expanded areas. However, in the training examples, the output's non-3 regions are higher than 3. Wait, but 3 is the default. So perhaps the output is 3 everywhere except where there are non-zero cells in the input's neighborhood, which are replaced by the maximum value in that neighborhood.\n\nWait, but in the training examples, all the non-zero input cells are replaced by their own values in larger regions. For example, in Example 1's input, there's a 6. The output's 6 is spread out, which suggests that the output is the maximum of the input's neighborhood, which would include 6, so those cells become 6.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nThe test input has 1s and 2s. Let's consider each cell in the output and compute the maximum value in the input cells within Manhattan distance 2.\n\nFor example, take cell (4,4) in the input (value 1). Its neighborhood includes:\n\nRows 2 to 6 (4-2 to 4+2), columns 2 to 6 (4-2 to 4+2).\n\nWithin this area, the input has 1s at (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), and 2s at (4,6), (5,6). However, the 2s at (4,6) and (5,6) are at Manhattan distance 2 from (4,4) (distance (0)+(2)=2 and (1)+(2)=3 respectively). Wait, (4,6) is 2 columns away from (4,4), so Manhattan distance is 2. So (4,6) is within the neighborhood. So the maximum value in the neighborhood for (4,4) would be 2. Wait, but the 2s are at (4,6) and (5,6). (4,6) is within Manhattan distance 2 from (4,4): 0 rows and 2 columns \u2192 distance 2. So the maximum is max(1, 2) \u2192 2. So the output cell (4,4) would be 2.\n\nBut according to the training examples, the output uses the highest number in the neighborhood. For example, in Example 0's output, the 4s overwrite the 2s. So in the test input, the 2s in the input have a neighborhood that includes themselves and possibly other cells. Let's see:\n\nTake cell (4,6) in the input, which has value 2. Its neighborhood (Manhattan distance 2) includes cells from rows 2-6 and columns 4-8. But in this test case, there's no data beyond column 6. So in this neighborhood, the 2 at (4,6) is the highest value. So the output cells around (4,6) would be 2.\n\nBut how does this affect the area around the 1s? For example, the cell (4,4) in the output would be the maximum value in its neighborhood. The neighborhood includes (4,6) with 2. So (4,4)'s output value is 2. Similarly, (3,4) would have a neighborhood that includes (4,6) (distance (3-4=1 row) + (4-6=2 columns) =3, which is beyond 2. So (3,4)'s neighborhood only includes the 1s and possibly (4,6) if the distance is <=2. Let me calculate:\n\nFor cell (3,4) in the input (value 1), the neighborhood includes cells (x,y) where |x-3| + |y-4| <=2.\n\nSo for (4,6), |4-3| + |6-4|=1+2=3, which is outside. So cell (3,4)'s neighborhood includes up to (3,6) would be |3-3| + |6-4|=0+2=2, so (3,6) is included. But in the input, (3,6) is 0. So the maximum in (3,4)'s neighborhood is 1.\n\nBut in the output, according to this model, the cell (3,4) would be 1. However, the cell (4,6) in the input has value 2. For cells around (4,6), their neighborhoods include that 2. For example, cell (4,5) in the output would have a neighborhood that includes (4,6) (distance 1), so the maximum would be 2. Similarly, cell (5,5) in the input has 1. Its neighborhood includes (4,6) (distance |5-4| + |5-6|=1+1=2) \u2192 the maximum would be 2. So the output for (5,5) is 2.\n\nBut in the test input's output, we need to apply this pattern. Let's try to visualize.\n\nThe test input's non-zero cells are:\n\n- (3,4) \u21921\n\n- (4,4) \u21921\n\n- (4,5) \u21921\n\n- (4,6) \u21922\n\n- (5,5) \u21921\n\n- (5,6) \u21922\n\nSo each of these cells will influence their surrounding areas (Manhattan distance <=2). The highest value in any such area would be 2, from the cells (4,6) and (5,6).\n\nSo, for any cell in the output that is within Manhattan distance 2 of either (4,6) or (5,6), the value would be 2. For cells only within distance 2 of the 1s but not the 2s, the value would be 1. Else, 3.\n\nNow, let's determine which cells are influenced by the 2s.\n\nThe cell (4,6) has a neighborhood of Manhattan distance 2. This includes:\n\n- Rows from 2 to 6 (4-2 to 4+2)\n\n- Columns from 4 to 8 (6-2 to 6+2), but since the grid is only 10 columns (0-9), columns 4-8.\n\nSo for (4,6), the neighborhood is rows 2-6 and columns 4-8. Any cell in this area with Manhattan distance <=2 from (4,6).\n\nSimilarly, for (5,6), the neighborhood is rows 3-7 and columns 4-8.\n\nSo overlapping areas of these will have max 2.\n\nThe 1s' neighborhoods would be areas where their influence is 1, unless they are within the 2's neighborhoods.\n\nFor example, the cell (4,5) is within the neighborhood of (4,6) (distance 1), so its output is 2.\n\nCell (3,4) is at distance 3 from (4,6) (1 row + 2 columns), so not in the neighborhood. So its output is 1.\n\nBut according to the training examples, the output's non-3 cells are grouped into contiguous regions. For example, in Example 3, the 8s form a T-shape. So, in the test case, the output should have regions of 1 and 2, but since 2 is higher, overlapping areas become 2.\n\nBut according to the training examples, when there are multiple non-zero cells, the higher number's influence takes over. So the output will have 2s wherever the 2's neighborhood overlaps, and 1s elsewhere where their neighborhoods are not overlapped by higher numbers.\n\nBut how to draw this.\n\nFor example, the cell (4,4) in the input is 1. Its neighborhood includes (4,6) (distance 2), so the maximum in that neighborhood is 2. So (4,4)'s output is 2.\n\nSimilarly, cell (4,5) is in the neighborhood of (4,6), so output 2.\n\nThe 1s at (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) will have their own neighborhoods, but any cell within distance 2 of (4,6) or (5,6) (which have value 2) will be 2.\n\nSo, the final output will be a mix of 2s in the regions around the 2s and 1s around the 1s, but where they overlap, 2 takes precedence.\n\nLet's try to sketch the output for the test input.\n\nFirst, all cells are 3 except where there's a non-zero in the input's neighborhood.\n\nThe 1s in the input:\n\n- (3,4): its neighborhood (Manhattan distance 2) includes cells from row 1 to 5, columns 2 to 6. Any cell in this area that isn't covered by a higher number (2) will be 1.\n\nThe 2s in the input:\n\n- (4,6) and (5,6): their neighborhoods (distance 2) include cells around them. For (4,6), rows 2-6, columns 4-8. For (5,6), rows 3-7, columns 4-8. So combined, these cover rows 2-7, columns 4-8. Any cell in this area is within distance 2 of at least one 2, so their output is 2.\n\nSo in the output:\n\n- Columns 4-8, rows 2-7: 2s (except possibly for cells outside the 2's neighborhood but within the 1's).\n\nBut wait, the 1's neighborhood includes some of these cells. For example, cell (3,4) is part of the 1's neighborhood. But cell (3,4) is also within the 2's neighborhood? The distance from (3,4) to (4,6) is 1 row and 2 columns \u2192 Manhattan distance 3, which is beyond 2. So cell (3,4) is not in the 2's neighborhood, so it would be 1.\n\nSimilarly, cell (3,5): distance to (4,6) is 1 row +1 column \u2192 2. So cell (3,5) is in the 2's neighborhood. So output is 2.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\n- For rows 2-6, columns 4-8:\n\n   - Cells here are within the 2's neighborhoods. So they are 2.\n\n- For the 1's neighborhoods outside of this area:\n\n   - For example, rows 1-5, columns 2-6:\n\n      - Cells in this area not covered by the 2's neighborhoods would be 1.\n\nBut how do these regions overlap?\n\nFor example, cell (3,5) is in both the 1's neighborhood (from (3,4)) and the 2's neighborhood (from (4,6)). Since 2 is higher, it becomes 2.\n\nAnother example: cell (4,4) is in the 1's neighborhood and the 2's neighborhood (distance to (4,6) is 2 \u2192 yes, so becomes 2.\n\nSo the output for the test case would be:\n\n- A region around the 2s (columns 4-8, rows 2-6) filled with 2s.\n\n- A region around the 1s (columns 2-6, rows 1-5) filled with 1s, but overlapping with the 2 region would be 2s.\n\n- Additionally, the 1 at (5,5) has a neighborhood that includes rows 3-7, columns 3-7. Some of these cells may fall into the 2's neighborhoods.\n\nSo, the final output would have 2s in a larger area around the two 2s, and 1s in areas not overlapping with the 2s' neighborhoods.\n\nBut according to the training examples, the output regions are contiguous and formed by expanding around the non-zero cells. For example, in Example 0, the 4s are in a diamond shape. So for the test case, the output should have 1s and 2s in their respective areas, with higher numbers overriding.\n\nBut the test input has 1s and 2s. The 2s are at (4,6) and (5,6). Their neighborhoods would create a larger region of 2s around them. The 1s' neighborhoods would create regions of 1s, but where they overlap with the 2s' regions, the 2s take precedence.\n\nSo, the output would have 3s in most areas, but:\n\n- A horizontal area around the 1s, but only where they don't overlap with the 2s' regions.\n\n- A larger area around the 2s.\n\nPutting this together, let's imagine the output grid.\n\nThe test input's non-zero cells are concentrated in rows 3-5 and columns 4-6. The 2s are at (4,6) and (5,6). Their neighborhoods extend to columns 4-8 and rows 2-6 for (4,6), and rows 3-7 for (5,6).\n\nBut since the grid is only 10 columns, columns 4-8 for rows 2-7 would cover up to column 8, but the test input's non-zero cells are up to column 6. So the 2s' neighborhoods will extend to column 8, but those columns in the input are zeros, but the output will still have 2s in those columns if they are within the neighborhood.\n\nHowever, in the training examples, the output's non-3 areas are compact. For example, in Example 3, the 8s form a T-shape, which is a compact area. So perhaps the structuring element is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the regions are not based on Manhattan distance but on something else. For instance, each non-zero cell in the input creates a vertical and horizontal line of length 3 in the output. For example, for a cell (i,j), the output has its row i-1, i, i+1 and columns j-1, j, j+1. So a 3x3 cross.\n\nBut how would that work with overlapping areas?\n\nIn the test input, the cell (4,6) with value 2 would create a cross in the output covering rows 3-5 and columns 5-7. The cell (5,6) with value 2 would create a cross in rows 4-6 and columns 5-7. Overlapping these would create a larger area of 2s.\n\nThe 1s at (3,4) would create a cross in rows 2-4 and columns 3-5. The 1s at (4,4) and (4,5) would create crosses around their positions.\n\nBut the 2s' crosses would overlap with the 1s' crosses, leading to the higher value (2) overriding.\n\nSo the output would have 2s in the area covered by the crosses of (4,6) and (5,6), and 1s in the areas covered by the 1s' crosses but not overlapping with the 2s.\n\nThis seems to fit the training examples better. For instance, Example 0's input has 4s that form a cross in the output, which is a larger area. So applying this to the test case:\n\n- The 1s would each create a 3x3 cross (3 rows and 3 columns around them), but where the crosses of the 2s overlap, those areas become 2.\n\nLet's visualize:\n\nThe 2 at (4,6) would generate a cross covering rows 3-5 and columns 5-7. The 2 at (5,6) would generate rows 4-6 and columns 5-7.\n\nCombined, this creates a cross from row 3 to 6 and columns 5-7. So in those areas, the output is 2.\n\nThe 1s at (3,4) generate a cross in rows 2-4, columns 3-5. The 1s at (4,4) generate rows 3-5, columns 3-5. The 1s at (4,5) generate rows 3-5, columns 4-6. The 1 at (5,5) generates rows 4-6, columns 4-6.\n\nThe overlapping areas between 1s and 2s would be where the crosses overlap. For example, the 1 at (4,5) generates columns 4-6 in row 3-5. The 2s' crosses include columns 5-7 in rows 3-6. So overlapping columns 5-6 in rows 3-5 would have both 1 and 2 crosses, leading to 2s.\n\nThus, the output would have:\n\n- Rows 2-4, columns 3-5: 1s, except columns 5-6 in rows 3-4, which are 2s.\n\n- Rows 3-5, columns 3-5: 1s overlapped by 2s in columns 5.\n\n- Rows 4-6, columns 4-6: 1s from (5,5), but overlapped by 2s in columns 5-7.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to apply this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nRows 3: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,1,1,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0]\n\nProcessing each non-zero cell and expanding their cross:\n\nFor each non-zero cell (i,j):\n\n- The cross is rows i-1, i, i+1 and columns j-1, j, j+1.\n\nBut wait, if the cell is (i,j), the cross includes:\n\n- All cells in row i from j-1 to j+1.\n\n- All cells in column j from i-1 to i+1.\n\nSo for cell (3,4) (value 1):\n\n- Row 3: columns 3-5.\n\n- Column 4: rows 2-4.\n\nSo output cells for this cross are:\n\nRow 2, column 4.\n\nRow 3, columns 3-5.\n\nRow 4, column 4.\n\nSimilarly for other cells.\n\nBut when cells overlap, the highest value is taken.\n\nLet's process each non-zero cell:\n\n1. Cell (3,4) \u21921:\n\n   - Row 3, columns 3-5.\n\n   - Column 4, rows 2-4.\n\n2. Cell (4,4) \u21921:\n\n   - Row 4, columns 3-5.\n\n   - Column 4, rows 3-5.\n\n3. Cell (4,5) \u21921:\n\n   - Row 4, columns 4-6.\n\n   - Column 5, rows 3-5.\n\n4. Cell (4,6) \u21922:\n\n   - Row 4, columns 5-7.\n\n   - Column 6, rows 3-5.\n\n5. Cell (5,5) \u21921:\n\n   - Row 5, columns 4-6.\n\n   - Column 5, rows 4-6.\n\n6. Cell (5,6) \u21922:\n\n   - Row 5, columns 5-7.\n\n   - Column 6, rows 4-6.\n\nNow, combining all these crosses and taking the maximum value:\n\nLet's go row by row:\n\nRow 0: all 3.\n\nRow 1: all 3.\n\nRow 2:\n\n- Column 4: 1 (from cell (3,4)'s column cross).\n\nRow 3:\n\n- Columns 3-5 from cell (3,4)'s row cross.\n\n- Column 4 also covered by cell (3,4)'s column cross (already covered).\n\n- Cell (3,5) is covered by cell (4,5)'s column cross (rows 3-5, column 5). Value 1.\n\n- Also, cell (3,6) is covered by cell (4,6)'s column cross (rows 3-5, column 6) \u2192 value 2.\n\nRow 4:\n\n- Columns 3-5 from cell (4,4)'s row cross.\n\n- Columns 4-6 from cell (4,5)'s row cross.\n\n- Columns 5-7 from cell (4,6)'s row cross.\n\n- Column 4: rows 3-5 (covered by cell (4,4)'s column cross).\n\n- Column 5: rows 3-5 (cell (4,5)'s column cross).\n\n- Column 6: rows 3-5 (cell (4,6)'s column cross).\n\nRow 5:\n\n- Columns 4-6 from cell (5,5)'s row cross.\n\n- Columns 5-7 from cell (5,6)'s row cross.\n\n- Column 5: rows 4-6 (cell (5,5)'s column cross).\n\n- Column 6: rows 4-6 (cell (5,6)'s column cross).\n\nRow 6:\n\n- Columns 4-6 from cell (5,5)'s column cross (rows 4-6, column 5).\n\n- Columns 5-7 from cell (5,6)'s column cross (rows 4-6, column 6).\n\nRows 7-9: all 3.\n\nNow, let's determine the values in each cell:\n\nRow 2:\n\n- Column 4: 1 (from cell (3,4) column cross). All others 3.\n\nRow 3:\n\n- Columns 3-5: 1 (from cell (3,4) row cross).\n\n- Column 6: 2 (from cell (4,6) column cross).\n\n- Column 5: 1 (from cell (4,5) column cross).\n\nBut wait, cell (3,5) is part of cell (4,5)'s column cross (rows 3-5, column 5). So value 1.\n\nAlso, cell (3,5) is part of cell (3,4)'s row cross (column 5 is j+1 of 4).\n\nSo cell (3,5) is covered by both cell (3,4) and (4,5), but since they're both 1, it's 1.\n\nBut cell (3,6) is covered by cell (4,6)'s column cross (rows 3-5, column 6) \u2192 value 2.\n\nSo row 3:\n\nColumns 3-5: 1.\n\nColumn 6: 2.\n\nOther columns: 3.\n\nRow 4:\n\n- Columns 3-5 from cell (4,4) row \u2192 1.\n\n- Columns 4-6 from cell (4,5) row \u21921.\n\n- Columns 5-7 from cell (4,6) row \u21922.\n\n- Column 4: covered by cell (4,4) column (rows 3-5) \u21921.\n\n- Column 5: covered by cell (4,5) column (rows 3-5) \u21921.\n\n- Column 6: covered by cell (4,6) column (rows 3-5) \u21922.\n\nSo row 4:\n\nColumns 3-5: 1.\n\nColumns 6-7: 2.\n\nBut wait, columns 5-7 are covered by cell (4,6)'s row cross (value 2). So overlapping with columns 4-6 (cell (4,5) row cross), in column 5-6, the value is max(1,2) \u21922.\n\nSo row 4:\n\nColumns 3-4: 1.\n\nColumns 5-7: 2.\n\nRow 5:\n\n- Columns 4-6 from cell (5,5) row \u21921.\n\n- Columns 5-7 from cell (5,6) row \u21922.\n\n- Column 5: covered by cell (5,5) column (rows 4-6) \u21921.\n\n- Column 6: covered by cell (5,6) column (rows 4-6) \u21922.\n\nSo row 5:\n\nColumns 4: 1 (from cell (5,5) row).\n\nColumns 5: max(1 from cell (5,5) row, 2 from cell (5,6) row) \u21922.\n\nColumns 6-7: 2.\n\nRow 6:\n\n- Column 5: covered by cell (5,5) column (rows 4-6) \u21921.\n\n- Column 6: covered by cell (5,6) column (rows 4-6) \u21922.\n\nBut row 6 is not part of any row cross from non-zero cells (since the non-zero cells are up to row 5). So row 6 would have:\n\nColumns 5: 1 (from cell (5,5) column cross up to row 6? If the cross for cell (5,5) includes row 5+1=6, then yes. So column 5, row 6 is 1.\n\nColumn 6, row 6 is part of cell (5,6)'s column cross (rows 4-6) \u21922.\n\nOther columns in row 6: 3.\n\nPutting this all together, the output would look like:\n\nRow 0: all 3s.\n\nRow 1: all 3s.\n\nRow 2: [3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 3: [3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,3,3]\n\nRow 4: [3,3,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]\n\nRow 5: [3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,3,3]\n\nRow 6: [3,3,3,3,3,1,2,3,3,3]\n\nRows 7-9: all 3s.\n\nBut wait, in row 4, columns 3-4 are 1, columns 5-7 are 2.\n\nRow 3: columns 3-5 are 1, column 6 is 2.\n\nRow 5: columns 4 is 1 (from cell (5,5) row cross?), but according to cell (5,5)'s row cross (columns 4-6), and cell (5,6)'s row cross (columns 5-7), so row 5's columns 4-6 would be covered by 1 and 2. But the max is 2 for columns 5-6, and 1 for column 4.\n\nBut let's re-examine:\n\nRow 5's row crosses:\n\n- From cell (5,5): columns 4-6 \u21921.\n\n- From cell (5,6): columns 5-7 \u21922.\n\nSo overlapping in columns 5-6, the max is 2.\n\nThus, row 5:\n\nColumns 4: 1.\n\nColumns 5-6: 2.\n\nColumn 7: 2.\n\nSo row 5 would be [3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,3,3].\n\nRow 6's column crosses:\n\n- From cell (5,5): column 5, rows 4-6 \u21921.\n\n- From cell (5,6): column 6, rows 4-6 \u21922.\n\nSo row 6, columns 5 and 6 are 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nThus, row 6: [3,3,3,3,3,1,2,3,3,3].\n\nNow, comparing this to the training examples, the output should have all 3s except for the expanded regions of the input's non-zero cells. The expected output should look something like:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,1,2,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, especially Example 3, which has an 8 forming a T-shape, the expansion is more about connecting adjacent regions. However, in this test case, the output includes a 1 in row 2, column 4, and some 2s extending to the right.\n\nBut according to the pattern we've deduced, this should be the correct output.",
