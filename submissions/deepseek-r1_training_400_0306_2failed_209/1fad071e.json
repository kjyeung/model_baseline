        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, we have these input matrices and corresponding output arrays, and I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input into the output. Then apply that to the test input.\n\nFirst, let's look at the training examples. Each input is a 9x9 grid (since there are 9 rows each with 9 elements), and the output is a 1D array of length 5. Let's start by examining the first example.\n\nExample 0 Input:\nLooking at the rows:\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1]\nRow 1: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2]\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]\nRow 4: [1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 5: [0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0]\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0]\nRow 7: All zeros except last element?\nRow 8: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nOutput is [1,1,0,0,0]. Hmm. Let's see what's common here. The output length is 5. Maybe each element in the output corresponds to a count of something in the input rows. Since there are 5 elements in the output and 9 rows in the input, perhaps it's grouped? Or maybe looking at specific positions.\n\nWait, maybe the output corresponds to the number of times a certain pattern occurs in each column or row. Let's check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output element is the count of a certain value in each row. But the output has 5 elements. Let's see. The first example's output starts with two 1s. Let's check if there's a pattern in rows where, say, the number of 1s or 2s in each row is counted. But each row has 9 elements. Let's see:\n\nFor Example 0's input:\n\nLooking at each row's elements:\n\nRow 0 has two 2s and one 1. The rest are 0s.\nRow 1 has two 1s and two 2s.\nRow 2 has two 1s, two 2s.\nRow 3 has two 2s.\nRow 4 has one 1 and two 2s.\nRow 5 has two 2s and two 1s.\nRow 6 has two 1s.\nRow 7 is all zeros except maybe one? Wait, row 7 in example 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\u2014all zeros. So no.\nRow 8 has two 1s.\n\nBut how does that relate to the output [1,1,0,0,0]? Not sure. Maybe the output counts the number of rows that have a certain feature. Let's see.\n\nThe output for Example 0 is [1,1,0,0,0]. So maybe each position in the output corresponds to a certain count. Like, first element is the count of rows with a specific pattern. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the input rows for Example 0:\n\nLooking for patterns. Maybe each row that starts with 0, followed by some 1s or 2s. Or maybe sequences of consecutive numbers. Let's check.\n\nRow 0: 0s followed by 2,2, then 0s and a 1.\nRow1: 0, then 1,1, then 0, 2,2, then 0s.\nRow2: 0,1,1, then 0s, then 2,2.\nRow4: starts with 1, then 0, then 2,2, etc.\nRow5: 0s, 2,2, 0s, 1,1, 0s.\nRow6: 0s, then 1,1.\n\nHmm. Maybe the key is to look for consecutive pairs of 1s or 2s in each row. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow0: 2,2 (positions 4-5) and then 0,0,1. So one pair of 2s.\nRow1: 1,1 (positions1-2) and 2,2 (positions4-5). Two pairs.\nRow2: 1,1 and 2,2. Two pairs.\nRow3: 2,2 (positions7-8). One pair.\nRow4: 2,2 (positions3-4). One pair.\nRow5: 2,2 (positions2-3) and 1,1 (positions5-6). Two pairs.\nRow6: 1,1 (positions5-6). One pair.\nRow7: no pairs.\nRow8: no consecutive 1s or 2s except the first 1 and the last 1, but they are not consecutive.\n\nSo the counts of pairs per row would be:\n\nRow0:1, Row1:2, Row2:2, Row3:1, Row4:1, Row5:2, Row6:1, Row7:0, Row8:0.\n\nBut the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Hmm. Maybe the output counts how many rows have a certain number of pairs. For example:\n\nIf the output is [number of rows with 0 pairs, 1 pair, 2 pairs, 3 pairs, etc.]. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0 input rows:\n\nRow7 and Row8 have 0 pairs. So count for 0 pairs is 2.\n\nRows with 1 pair: Row0, Row3, Row4, Row6 \u2192 4 rows.\n\nRows with 2 pairs: Row1, Row2, Row5 \u2192 3 rows.\n\nRows with 3 or more: none.\n\nBut the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. That doesn't match. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is counting the number of pairs (like 1s and 2s) across the entire grid, but grouped in some way. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nTotal pairs of 1s: Let's see:\n\nRow1 has 1,1 \u2192 count as 1 pair.\n\nRow2: 1,1 \u2192 1 pair.\n\nRow5: 1,1 \u2192 1 pair.\n\nRow6:1,1 \u21921 pair.\n\nRow8 has two 1s but not consecutive. So total 4 pairs of 1s.\n\nPairs of 2s:\n\nRow0:2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow1:2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow2:2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow3:2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow4:2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow5:2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow6: none.\n\nSo total 6 pairs of 2s.\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nWait the output is 5 elements. Maybe it's a binary representation? Or perhaps each element represents a certain condition per column. Let's check columns.\n\nEach input is 9x9. Output is 5 elements. So maybe columns are grouped? 9 columns divided into 5 groups. Wait 9 columns can't split into 5 groups evenly. Alternatively, perhaps each output element corresponds to a certain position in the grid. Or maybe the output is related to the counts in the diagonals or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the counts of specific sequences in the rows. For example, the first element in the output counts the number of rows that start with 0,1,1 or 2,2. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0, output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Let's see:\n\nLooking for rows starting with 0,1,1: In Example0, Row1 starts with 0,1,1. Row2 starts with 0,1,1. So two rows. But first output element is 1. Hmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of 1s in specific positions. For example, the first element is the number of times a 1 appears in the first position of any row. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0 input:\n\nRow0 starts with 0.\n\nRow1:0.\n\nRow2:0.\n\nRow3:0.\n\nRow4:1.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:0.\n\nRow7:0.\n\nRow8:0.\n\nSo only Row4 starts with 1. So first element would be 1. The output's first element is 1. That matches. Then second output element is 1. Maybe the second element is the count of rows starting with 0, followed by 1,1. Let's see:\n\nRows in Example0 input:\n\nRow1 starts with 0,1,1.\n\nRow2 starts with 0,1,1.\n\nSo two such rows. But output's second element is 1. Hmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output element corresponds to the count of a certain pattern in the entire grid. For example, the output elements could be counts of different patterns.\n\nBut perhaps looking for the occurrence of 1,1 and 2,2 in each row. Let's see in Example0:\n\nEach row can have multiple pairs. For example, Row1 has 1,1 and 2,2. So two pairs. The output for Example0 is [1,1,0,0,0]. Maybe the output counts the number of rows that have exactly 1 pair of 1s, 1 pair of 2s, etc. Wait, but how does that map to the output?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the output represents the number of times a certain pair (like 1,1 or 2,2) appears in the entire grid. Let's count:\n\nExample0 input:\n\nPairs of 1s:\n\nRow1:1,1 \u21921\n\nRow2:1,1 \u21921\n\nRow5:1,1 \u21921 (positions 5-6)\n\nRow6:1,1 \u21921 (positions5-6)\n\nRow8: no consecutive 1s.\n\nTotal 4 pairs of 1s.\n\nPairs of 2s:\n\nRow0:2,2 \u21921\n\nRow1:2,2 \u21921\n\nRow2:2,2 \u21921 (positions7-8)\n\nRow3:2,2 \u21921 (positions7-8)\n\nRow4:2,2 \u21921 (positions3-4)\n\nRow5:2,2 \u21921 (positions2-3)\n\nTotal 6 pairs of 2s.\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0]. If output is [count of 1-pairs, count of 2-pairs, ...], but 4 and 6 would be higher than 1. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of rows where the number of 1-pairs plus 2-pairs equals the output's index. For example, first element is the number of rows with 0 pairs, second with 1, etc. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow0 has 1 pair (2s) \u2192 count as 1.\n\nRow1: two pairs (1s and 2s) \u2192 count as 2.\n\nRow2: two pairs.\n\nRow3: one pair (2s).\n\nRow4: one pair (2s).\n\nRow5: two pairs.\n\nRow6: one pair (1s).\n\nRow7: 0.\n\nRow8:0.\n\nSo counts per row pairs:\n\n0 pairs: rows7,8 \u21922 rows.\n\n1 pair: rows0,3,4,6 \u21924 rows.\n\n2 pairs: rows1,2,5 \u21923 rows.\n\nSo the counts would be [2,4,3,0,0]. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is not about pairs but sequences of three. Or perhaps the position of the pairs.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's output [1,1,0,0,0], maybe it's binary flags for some condition. Like first element is 1 if there's at least one row starting with 1, else 0. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0 input, row4 starts with 1. So first output element is 1. That matches.\n\nSecond output element is 1. Maybe if there's a row starting with 0 followed by 1,1. Yes, rows1 and 2 start with 0,1,1. But output's second element is 1. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element corresponds to the presence of a certain pattern in each of the first five rows. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0, the output has 5 elements. The input has 9 rows. Maybe output is based on the first 5 rows.\n\nLooking at the first five rows of Example0 input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1]\n\nRow1: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2]\n\nRow4: [1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking for patterns in these rows. Let's see:\n\nRow0: contains 2,2.\n\nRow1: contains 1,1 and 2,2.\n\nRow2: contains 1,1 and 2,2.\n\nRow3: contains 2,2.\n\nRow4: contains 2,2.\n\nSo the first five rows each have at least one pair. But output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on columns. Let's look at columns in the input. Each column has 9 elements. Let's take Example0's columns:\n\nColumn0: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 has one 1.\n\nColumn1: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 has two 1s and a 1 at the end.\n\nBut how would columns relate to an output of 5 elements?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the counts of certain values in specific positions. For example, the first element of the output is the count of 1s in the fifth position (index 4) of each row. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow0's index4 is 2.\n\nRow1: index4 is 2.\n\nRow2: index4 is 0.\n\nRow3: 0.\n\nRow4:0.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:0.\n\nRow7:0.\n\nRow8:0.\n\nSo count of 1s here: 0. Output's first element is 1. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of certain rows. For example, adding rows 0-4 and taking the first five elements. Let's see:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1 \u2192 first five: [0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow1:0,1,1,0,2 \u2192 sum: 0+1+1+0+2=4\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element corresponds to the presence of a certain sequence in the entire grid. For example, the first element is 1 if there's a row with two 1s, the second if there's a row with two 2s, etc. But the outputs have multiple 1s. Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0], so maybe first two elements are 1, indicating presence of certain patterns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the count of rows that have a specific pattern in their first five elements. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0, output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Let's check the first five elements of each row:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow1: [0,1,1,0,2]\n\nRow2: [0,1,1,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [1,0,2,2,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,2,2,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,1,0,0,0]\n\nLooking for patterns in these first five elements. For example, sequences like [0,1,1,0,2] (row1) or [0,1,1,0,0] (row2). Maybe the output counts how many times certain sequences appear. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output counts how many times a certain value appears in the fifth column (index 4) across all rows. In Example0:\n\nRow0's index4: 2\n\nRow1: 2\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:0\n\nSo there are two 2s here. But the output starts with 1,1. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: look at the outputs of all examples. \n\nExample0 output: [1,1,0,0,0]\n\nExample1 output: [1,1,1,1,0]\n\nExample2 output: [1,1,1,1,0]\n\nSo all examples have outputs starting with 1,1. Maybe the first two elements are always 1,1, which is not the case. Wait Example0 has [1,1,0,0,0], Example1 and 2 have four 1s. So perhaps the pattern is related to the number of times certain patterns appear in the rows, but varying.\n\nAnother idea: the output could be counting the number of occurrences of 1s followed by 0s in certain positions. For example, in each row, check if there's a transition from 1 to 0. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a binary representation where each bit represents whether a certain row has a specific feature. But since the output has five elements, maybe each element corresponds to a row group. For example, first element is for rows 0-1, second for 2-3, etc., but with five groups (since 9 rows divided into 5 groups: 2,2,2,2,1). Let's see.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nOutput is [1,1,0,0,0]. Suppose each group checks if there's at least one row in the group that has two pairs (1s or 2s). Let's check:\n\nGroup 0 (rows0-1):\n\nRow0: 1 pair (2s)\n\nRow1: 2 pairs (1s and 2s) \u2192 so group has at least one row with two pairs \u2192 output element 0 would be 1?\n\nBut Example0's output first element is 1.\n\nGroup1 (rows2-3):\n\nRow2 has two pairs, row3 has one \u2192 so group1 has a row with two pairs \u2192 output element1 is 1.\n\nGroup2 (rows4-5):\n\nRow4 has one pair, row5 has two \u2192 so group2 has at least one row with two \u2192 output element2 should be 1, but example0's output element2 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the test input. Let's look at it to see if there's a pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,1]\n\nRow1: [1,1,0,1,0,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,2,2,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\n\nRow7: [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,0]\n\nRow8: [2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nNow, what's the output going to be? Based on previous examples, perhaps it's counting certain pairs in each row.\n\nLooking at the test input rows for pairs:\n\nRow0: 2,2 (positions5-6) \u2192 one pair.\n\nRow1: 1,1 (positions0-1) and 2,2 (positions5-6) \u2192 two pairs.\n\nRow2: 1,1 (0-1) \u2192 one pair.\n\nRow3:1,1 (positions5-6) \u2192 one pair.\n\nRow4: 2,2 (positions1-2) and 1,1 (positions5-6) \u2192 two pairs.\n\nRow5:2,2 (1-2) \u2192 one pair.\n\nRow6:2,2 (positions6-7) \u2192 one pair.\n\nRow7:2,2 (0-1), 1,1 (3-4), 2,2 (6-7) \u2192 three pairs.\n\nRow8:2,2 (0-1), 1,1 (3-4) \u2192 two pairs.\n\nSo per row pairs count:\n\nRow0:1\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:2\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:1\n\nRow7:3\n\nRow8:2\n\nSo if the output is counting the number of rows with 0,1,2,3,4 pairs, the counts would be:\n\n0 pairs: 0 rows.\n\n1 pair: rows0,2,3,5,6 \u21925 rows.\n\n2 pairs: rows1,4,8 \u21923 rows.\n\n3 pairs: row7 \u21921 row.\n\n4 pairs: 0.\n\nSo the output would be [0,5,3,1,0]. But the example outputs are shorter, like [1,1,0,0,0], etc. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: look at the output lengths. All outputs are length 5. Perhaps each element corresponds to the number of occurrences of a certain number of pairs in the rows. For example:\n\nIf the first element is the number of rows with exactly 1 pair of 1s, the second element pairs of 2s, etc. But not sure.\n\nWait in Example0's output [1,1,0,0,0], maybe:\n\n- The first element is the number of rows with a pair of 1s followed by a pair of 2s.\n\nLooking at Example0's input:\n\nRow1: has 1,1 followed by 2,2. So yes.\n\nRow2: same as row1? Let's see row2: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2]. So after the 1,1, there's a 0, then later 2,2. So not adjacent. So maybe not.\n\nRow5: has 2,2 followed by 1,1. So order matters.\n\nSo row1 in example0 has 1,1 followed by 2,2. So that's one row. So first element is 1. Second element maybe the number of rows with 2,2 followed by 1,1. In example0, none. But the output's second element is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: the output represents the number of times certain pairs of numbers appear in consecutive rows. For example, row0 and row1 both have 2,2 in their fifth and sixth positions. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait let's look at the first example's output:\n\nExample1 output is [1,1,1,1,0]. Let's see what's different in Example1's input.\n\nExample1 input has rows with more pairs. For instance:\n\nRow0: [1,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,2] \u2192 has 1,1.\n\nRow1: [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0] \u2192 two pairs of 1s.\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0] \u2192 2,2 and 1,1.\n\nRow8: [0,1,0,2,2,0,1,1,0] \u2192 2,2 and 1,1.\n\nSo maybe the output counts the number of times a row has both a pair of 1s and a pair of 2s. In Example1, how many rows have both?\n\nRow0: 1,1 and 2 (but not a pair). So no.\n\nRow1: two pairs of 1s, no 2s. So no.\n\nRow7: has 2,2 and 1,1 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow8: 2,2 and 1,1 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo two rows. But Example1's output is [1,1,1,1,0]. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look for the positions of the pairs. Maybe the output is counting pairs that are positioned in certain columns.\n\nFor example, if a pair of 1s starts at column 1 or something. Let's check Example0:\n\nRow1: 1,1 starts at index1.\n\nRow2: same.\n\nRow5: 1,1 at index5.\n\nRow6: at index5.\n\nSo in Example0, four pairs of 1s starting at different positions. But output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is counting how many times a certain number of pairs appear in each column. For example, columns 0-4. Let's see:\n\nEach output is 5 elements. Maybe each corresponds to a column (0-4). For each column, count how many times a pair (consecutive numbers) appears.\n\nFor Example0's input:\n\nColumns 0-4:\n\nColumn0: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. Only one 1, no pairs.\n\nColumn1: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1]. Has 1,1 (row1 and row2). So two pairs?\n\nWait, in column1, pairs are vertical. So consecutive rows. For example, in column1, rows1 and 2 are 1 and 1. But pairs are horizontal, not vertical. Oh right, pairs in the rows.\n\nWait, perhaps pairs in the columns. For each column, check if there are consecutive numbers vertically. Like in column1 of Example0, rows1 and 2 have 1s. So two consecutive 1s vertically? No, rows1 and 2 are consecutive rows but column1 has 1 in row1 and row2. So vertically, two 1s in a row. So that's a pair.\n\nBut how many columns have such vertical pairs.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nColumn0: All zeros except row4 has 1. No vertical pairs.\n\nColumn1: rows1,2 have 1,1. So a vertical pair. Also row8 has 1. But not consecutive.\n\nColumn2: rows1,2 have 1,1 (wait no: row1's column2 is 1, row2's column2 is 1. Are they consecutive? Rows are consecutive. So column2 has 1,1 in rows1-2 \u2192 vertical pair.\n\nColumn3: All zeros except row4 has 2. No pairs.\n\nColumn4: row0 and 1 have 2,2. Column4: 2,2 in rows0 and 1. But that's vertical. So a vertical pair.\n\nWait, but vertical pairs would be consecutive elements in the same column across adjacent rows. So column4 in Example0:\n\nRow0: 2\n\nRow1:2\n\nSo two consecutive rows with 2 in column4 \u2192 a vertical pair.\n\nSimilarly, column7 in Example0's input has 2,2 in row3 and row2? Row2's column7 is 2 (since row2 is [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2], so column7 is 2. Row3's column7 is 2. So rows2 and 3 have 2 in column7, consecutive rows. So that's a vertical pair.\n\nSo, for each column, count the number of vertical pairs (two consecutive rows with the same number). Then, the output could be the count for each of the first five columns.\n\nLet's check Example0:\n\nColumns0-4:\n\nColumn0: no vertical pairs.\n\nColumn1: rows1-2 have 1s (row1 column1=1, row2 column1=1). So vertical pair.\n\nColumn2: rows1-2 have 1s (row1 col2=1, row2 col2=1). So vertical pair.\n\nColumn3: no.\n\nColumn4: rows0-1 have 2s. So vertical pair.\n\nSo columns0: 0 pairs.\n\nColumns1-4: 1 pair each.\n\nSo for columns0-4, the vertical pair counts are [0,1,1,0,1]. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output counts the number of vertical pairs in each of the five first columns. For columns0-4, sum the vertical pairs.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nColumn0:0\n\nColumn1:1\n\nColumn2:1\n\nColumn3:0\n\nColumn4:1\n\nTotal for first five columns: 0+1+1+0+1=3. But output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Another angle: Let's look at the output length of 5. The examples have outputs with varying numbers of 1s. Example0 has two 1s, Example1 and 2 have four 1s. The test input's rows have varying numbers of pairs. For instance, row7 has three pairs (2,2, 1,1, 2,2).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a binary encoding where each element represents whether a certain type of pair exists in any row. For example:\n\nFirst output element: 1 if there's a row with a pair of 1s.\n\nSecond: 1 if there's a row with a pair of 2s.\n\nThird: 1 if there's a row with both pairs of 1s and 2s.\n\nFourth: 1 if there's a row with three pairs.\n\nFifth: 1 if there's a row with four pairs.\n\nIn Example0:\n\n- Pairs of 1s exist (rows1,2,5,6). So first element is 1.\n\n- Pairs of 2s exist (many rows). Second element is 1.\n\n- Rows with both 1s and 2s: rows1,2,5. So third element should be 1. But Example0's output third element is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: the output corresponds to the number of different types of pairs across all rows. For example, the first element is the number of rows with exactly one pair (regardless of 1s or 2s), second element is rows with exactly two pairs, etc.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRows with one pair: rows0,3,4,6 \u21924 rows.\n\nRows with two pairs: rows1,2,5 \u21923 rows.\n\nRows with three pairs: none.\n\nSo output would be [4,3,0,0,0], but the actual output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the maximum number of pairs in any row. In Example0, the max is 2. But output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's check if the output corresponds to the number of times certain patterns appear in the rows, like the number of times 1,1 is followed by 0,0 or something.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input's rows:\n\nRow7: [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,0] \u2192 has 2,2 and 1,1 and 2,2 again. So three pairs.\n\nRow8: [2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 two pairs.\n\nIf the output counts the number of rows with three pairs (element4?), then in the test input, there's one such row (row7). But how does this relate to previous examples?\n\nExample1's output is [1,1,1,1,0]. Perhaps in Example1, there are rows with 3 pairs. Let's check.\n\nExample1 input:\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0] \u2192 two pairs (2,2 and 1,1).\n\nRow8: [0,1,0,2,2,0,1,1,0] \u2192 two pairs (2,2 and 1,1).\n\nNo rows with three pairs. So why does Example1's output have four 1s?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I'm missing a simpler pattern. Let's think of the output as flags for certain conditions.\n\nLooking at Example0's output: [1,1,0,0,0]. So first two elements are 1s. Maybe this indicates that there are rows with a pair of 1s and rows with a pair of 2s. But how does that map to the output length of 5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element corresponds to a specific row in the input, but only the first five rows. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0, first five rows:\n\nRow0: has 2,2 \u2192 pair.\n\nRow1: has 1,1 and 2,2 \u2192 two pairs.\n\nRow2: has 1,1 and 2,2 \u2192 two pairs.\n\nRow3: has 2,2 \u2192 one pair.\n\nRow4: has 2,2 \u2192 one pair.\n\nThe output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Maybe each output element indicates if the corresponding row has at least one pair. Row0: yes (1). Row1: yes (1). Row2: yes (1). Row3: yes (1). Row4: yes (1). So the output would be [1,1,1,1,1], but Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's try another approach. Maybe the output is the number of times each of the first five elements of the middle row (row4) appear in the entire grid.\n\nExample0's middle row (row4) is [1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. The first five elements are [1,0,2,2,0]. Let's count how many times each of these values appears in the entire grid.\n\n1 appears in row4's first element: 1. How many 1s are in the grid?\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nRow1: two 1s.\n\nRow2: two 1s.\n\nRow4: one 1.\n\nRow5: two 1s.\n\nRow6: two 1s.\n\nRow8: two 1s.\n\nTotal 1s: 2+2+1+2+2+2= 11. So the first element of the output (1) could be 11 mod 2 is 1. But why? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the parity (even or odd) of the count of each of the first five elements in the middle row.\n\nMiddle row first five elements: 1,0,2,2,0.\n\nCount of 1s in grid: 11 \u2192 odd \u2192 1.\n\nCount of 0s in grid: let's see. The entire grid has 9*9=81 elements. Number of 0s = 81 - (number of 1s + 2s).\n\nNumber of 1s: 11.\n\nNumber of 2s: Let's count. Each pair is two elements, but also check if there are single 2s.\n\nRow0: two 2s.\n\nRow1: two 2s.\n\nRow2: two 2s.\n\nRow3: two 2s.\n\nRow4: two 2s.\n\nRow5: two 2s.\n\nRow6: none.\n\nRow7: none.\n\nRow8: none.\n\nTotal 2s: 2*6=12.\n\nSo number of 0s:81-11-12=58.\n\nBut the middle row's first five elements: 0 appears three times. How does that relate?\n\nThis approach is leading me nowhere. Maybe I should think outside the box. Maybe the output is the count of islands of 1s and 2s in each row, summed in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as a 9x9 grid where 1s and 2s form certain shapes, and the output is the number of specific shapes.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the result of a specific operation, like the sum of certain diagonals or the trace of the matrix.\n\nWait, the output has five elements. The trace of a 9x9 matrix would have 9 elements. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: The output could be the counts of the numbers 1 and 2 in specific positions. For example, the first element is the count of 1s in the fifth position (index4) of all rows. Let's check for Example0:\n\nRow0's index4:2\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:0\n\nSo count of 1s here is 0. Output's first element is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the count of 1s and 2s in the first five columns of each row. For Example0:\n\nFirst five columns of each row:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,2] \u2192 0 1s, 1 2.\n\nRow1: [0,1,1,0,2] \u2192 2 1s, 1 2.\n\nRow2: [0,1,1,0,0] \u2192 2 1s.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 0.\n\nRow4: [1,0,2,2,0] \u21921 1, 2 2s.\n\nRow5: [0,0,2,2,0] \u2192 2 2s.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow8: [0,1,0,0,0] \u21921 1.\n\nTotal 1s in first five columns: row1 has 2, row2 has 2, row4 has1, row8 has1. Total 6.\n\nTotal 2s: row0 (1), row1 (1), row4 (2), row5 (2). Total 6.\n\nBut the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of rows where the first occurrence of a pair is 1s or 2s. For example:\n\nIn Example0:\n\nRow0: first pair is 2s \u2192 counted as 2.\n\nRow1: first pair is 1s \u2192 counted as 1.\n\nRow2: first pair is 1s \u21921.\n\nRow3: first pair is 2s \u21922.\n\nRow4: first pair is 2s \u21922.\n\nRow5: first pair is 2s \u21922.\n\nRow6: first pair is 1s \u21921.\n\nRow7: no pairs.\n\nRow8: no pairs.\n\nSo count of rows where first pair is 1s: rows1,2,6 \u21923.\n\nCount where first pair is 2s: rows0,3,4,5 \u21924.\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting really frustrating. Let's try to see if there's a different approach. Maybe the output is the result of some arithmetic or logical operation on each row. For example, sum modulo 2 or something.\n\nBut the output is five elements. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Maybe each element is the sum of the first five elements of each row modulo 2, but that would give a list of 9 elements. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, take the sum of each column and then take modulo 2 for the first five columns. Let's compute for Example0:\n\nColumns0-4 sums:\n\nColumn0: 0+0+0+0+1+0+0+0+0 =1.\n\nColumn1:0+1+1+0+0+0+0+0+1=3.\n\nColumn2:0+1+1+0+2+2+0+0+0=6.\n\nColumn3:0+0+0+0+2+2+0+0+0=4.\n\nColumn4:2+2+0+0+0+0+0+0+0=4.\n\nSum modulo 2:\n\nColumn0:1 mod2=1.\n\nColumn1:3 mod2=1.\n\nColumn2:6 mod2=0.\n\nColumn3:4 mod2=0.\n\nColumn4:4 mod2=0.\n\nSo output would be [1,1,0,0,0], which matches Example0's output!\n\nLet's check Example1:\n\nExample1 input:\n\nLet's compute column sums for first five columns (columns0-4):\n\nRow0: [1,1,0,2,0] \u2192 sum=4.\n\nRow1: [1,1,0,0,0] \u2192 sum=2.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,2,0] \u2192 sum=2.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 sum=0.\n\nRow4: [0,1,1,0,2] \u2192 sum=4.\n\nRow5: [0,1,1,0,2] \u2192 sum=4.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 sum=0.\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 sum=4.\n\nRow8: [0,1,0,2,2] \u2192 sum=5.\n\nSum for each column:\n\nColumn0: 1+1+0+0+0+0+0+0+0=2.\n\nColumn1:1+1+0+0+1+1+0+0+1=5.\n\nColumn2:0+0+0+0+1+1+0+0+0=2.\n\nColumn3:2+0+2+0+0+0+0+2+2=8.\n\nColumn4:0+0+0+0+2+2+0+2+2=8.\n\nNow mod2:\n\nColumn0:2 mod2=0.\n\nColumn1:5 mod2=1.\n\nColumn2:2 mod2=0.\n\nColumn3:8 mod2=0.\n\nColumn4:8 mod2=0.\n\nBut Example1's output is [1,1,1,1,0]. According to this, it would be [0,1,0,0,0], which doesn't match. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, but in Example0, this method worked. But in Example1, it doesn't. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the parity (even or odd) of the number of 1s and 2s in each of the first five rows. Let's see:\n\nExample0's first five rows:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1 \u2192 1s:1, 2s:2.\n\nRow1:0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0 \u21921s:2, 2s:2.\n\nRow2:0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2 \u21921s:2, 2s:2.\n\nRow3:0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2 \u21921s:0, 2s:2.\n\nRow4:1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0 \u21921s:1, 2s:2.\n\nSo for each of the first five rows, count the 1s and 2s:\n\nRow0: 1, 2 \u2192 both odd (1 is odd, 2 even). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, sum of 1s and 2s per row:\n\nRow0:1+2=3 (odd).\n\nRow1:2+2=4 (even).\n\nRow2:2+2=4 (even).\n\nRow3:0+2=2 (even).\n\nRow4:1+2=3 (odd).\n\nThen the parity for each of the first five rows is [odd, even, even, even, odd]. If the output is based on this, perhaps [1,0,0,0,1]. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother thought: The output may be related to the number of times 1 and 2 appear in the fifth column (index4) across all rows. For Example0:\n\nColumn4 has elements:\n\nRow0:2\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:0\n\nSo count of 1s:0, 2s:2. But output's first element is 1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the counts of 1s and 2s in the fifth column (index4) and subsequent columns. For example:\n\nIndex4: 2 occurs twice. Index5: 2 occurs in row0,1,2,3,5. Index6: 0s. Index7:2s in row3,2. Index8:1, etc. Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to see if there's a pattern between the examples.\n\nExample0 output: [1,1,0,0,0]\n\nExample1 output: [1,1,1,1,0]\n\nExample2 output: [1,1,1,1,0]\n\nTest input's expected output would likely follow the same pattern. Let's look for what's common in the first three examples.\n\nExample0's output starts with two 1s, then zeros. Examples1 and 2 have four 1s. So perhaps the number of 1s in the output corresponds to some feature that's present in more rows in examples1 and 2.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output is the count of how many times each of the first five rows has a pair of 1s followed by a pair of 2s. For example, in row1 of Example0, there's a 1,1 followed by 2,2. So this would contribute to the first output element. If each output element corresponds to a row, then first five rows. Example0 has such a case in row1 (first output element 1). But then other elements are 1,0,0,0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be indicating for each of the first five rows whether they contain both a 1,1 and a 2,2 pair. In Example0:\n\nRow0: no.\n\nRow1: yes \u21921.\n\nRow2: yes (1,1 and 2,2) \u21921.\n\nRow3: no.\n\nRow4: yes (2,2) but no 1,1. So no.\n\nRow5: has 2,2 and 1,1 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo first five rows: rows1,2,5 \u2192 but output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Maybe the output is for the first five rows, each indicating if they have both pairs. Rows1 and 2 are in the first five. So output elements 1 and 2 would be 1. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0], so first two elements are 1. This could fit if the first two rows (0 and 1) have the condition. Wait row0 doesn't have both pairs, row1 does. So output element0 would be 0, element1 would be1. Doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Let's try to see the possible answer for the test input based on the previous examples.\n\nThe test input's output, based on the previous examples which have varying numbers of 1s, but the test input has multiple rows with pairs. For instance, row7 has three pairs, which none of the training examples have. So maybe the output for the test case is [1,1,1,1,0], similar to examples1 and 2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number of rows where the number of pairs (1s and 2s) is equal to the output's index+1. For example:\n\nOutput element0: rows with 1 pair.\n\nOutput element1: rows with 2 pairs.\n\nOutput element2: rows with 3 pairs.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nRows with 1 pair: rows0,2,3,5,6,7,8? Wait, row7 has three pairs. So rows0,2,3,5,6,8 have 1 or 2 pairs. Row7 has 3 pairs.\n\nSo:\n\nelement0: count of rows with 1 pair: rows0,2,3,5,6 \u21925.\n\nelement1: rows with 2 pairs: rows1,4,8 \u21923.\n\nelement2: rows with3 pairs: row7 \u21921.\n\nelements3 and4: 0.\n\nBut the output would be [5,3,1,0,0], which doesn't match the previous examples' format. So this can't be.\n\nI think I need to look for a different approach. Let's think about the outputs:\n\nExample0: [1,1,0,0,0]\n\nExample1: [1,1,1,1,0]\n\nExample2: [1,1,1,1,0]\n\nNotice that in Example0, there are two 1s, while in Examples1 and 2, there are four 1s. The test input has multiple pairs, including a row with three pairs. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the count of 1s in the first five columns of each row. Let's check Example0:\n\nFirst five columns of each row:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,2] \u21920 1s.\n\nRow1: [0,1,1,0,2] \u21922 1s.\n\nRow2: [0,1,1,0,0] \u21922 1s.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0] \u21920.\n\nRow4: [1,0,2,2,0] \u21921.\n\nRow5: [0,0,2,2,0] \u21920.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0] \u21920.\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0] \u21920.\n\nRow8: [0,1,0,0,0] \u21921.\n\nTotal 1s in first five columns of all rows: 2+2+1+1=6. But output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: The output could be a binary representation where each bit represents whether a certain condition is met in the corresponding row. For example, the first five rows each contribute a bit to the output based on some condition.\n\nExample0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Let's check the first five rows:\n\nRow0: has a pair of 2s \u21921.\n\nRow1: has pairs of 1s and 2s \u21921.\n\nRow2: has pairs of 1s and 2s \u21921.\n\nRow3: has pair of 2s \u21921.\n\nRow4: has pair of 2s \u21921.\n\nBut output has first two elements as 1 and the next three as 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element corresponds to the presence of a pair in the corresponding row's first five elements. For example:\n\nOutput element0: 1 if row0 has a pair in first five elements.\n\nIn Example0, row0's first five are [0,0,0,0,2]. The first four are zeros, so a pair of zeros. But the pairs are of zeros. But the examples' outputs don't count zeros. So maybe only pairs of 1s or 2s.\n\nRow0's first five have no pairs of 1s or 2s. So output element0 would be 0. But Example0's output starts with 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAfter hours of trying different approaches and not finding a clear pattern, I think the key might be to look at the parity of the number of pairs in each row. For each row, if the number of pairs is odd, assign 1; even, 0. Then sum these for each row group. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be the number of pairs (1s and 2s) in the first five rows, then next five rows, etc. But with five output elements.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nFirst five rows:\n\nRow0:1 pair (2s).\n\nRow1:2 pairs.\n\nRow2:2 pairs.\n\nRow3:1 pair.\n\nRow4:1 pair.\n\nTotal pairs:1+2+2+1+1=7. But output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the count of pairs in each of the first five columns across all rows.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nColumn0: no pairs.\n\nColumn1: 1,1 in rows1-2 \u2192 vertical pair.\n\nColumn2:1,1 in rows1-2 \u2192 vertical pair.\n\nColumn3: no.\n\nColumn4:2,2 in rows0-1 \u2192 vertical pair.\n\nSo columns0-4 have 0,1,1,0,1 pairs. Summing these gives [0,1,1,0,1], but output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm really stuck. Considering the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps the pattern is related to the number of times 1,1 and 2,2 appear in the same row, and the output elements represent counts of rows with different numbers of such pairs. For example, the first element is the number of rows with exactly one pair, the second with exactly two, etc. Let's check:\n\nExample0:\n\nRows with 1 pair: rows0,3,4,6 \u21924.\n\nRows with 2 pairs: rows1,2,5 \u21923.\n\nRows with 3 pairs: none.\n\nSo output would be [4,3,0,0,0], but Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nBut what if the output is binary flags for whether there exists at least one row with that many pairs? For example, if there's at least one row with one pair, output[0] =1. If at least one row with two pairs, output[1]=1. etc.\n\nIn Example0, there are rows with one pair and two pairs, so output would be [1,1,0,0,0], which matches. In Example1:\n\nRows have pairs up to two. So output would be [1,1,0,0,0]. But Example1's output is [1,1,1,1,0]. So this doesn't fit. Unless there's a row with three pairs in Example1. Let's check:\n\nExample1's input:\n\nLooking for rows with three pairs:\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0] \u2192 two pairs (2,2 and 1,1).\n\nRow8: [0,1,0,2,2,0,1,1,0] \u2192 two pairs (2,2 and 1,1).\n\nNo rows with three pairs. So this approach doesn't explain Example1's output.\n\nFinally, after trying so many possibilities and not finding a clear pattern, I'll make a guess based on the training examples and the test input. The test input's row7 has three pairs, which none of the training examples have. However, the output for the test input might be [1,1,1,1,0], similar to examples1 and 2. Because the test input has multiple rows with two pairs and one with three, but the output might cap at four 1s. So I'll guess the output is [1,1,1,1,0].",

Let's look at the examples.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 9x9 grid. The output is [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Hmm. Maybe each position in the output corresponds to a row or column in the input? Let me check the rows. Wait, the output has 5 elements, and the input has 9 rows and 9 columns. That doesn't match. Maybe it's something else.\n\nLooking at the input values: 0, 1, 2. Maybe they represent something. Let's see the output. In example 0, two 1s followed by three 0s. What if it's counting the number of certain patterns in each row or column?\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the count of a specific pattern across each row. Let's check each row in Example 0's input. For instance, the first row is [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1]. Maybe looking for consecutive 2s or 1s. The output has 5 elements, maybe for each of the middle rows? Or perhaps the number of times a certain sequence occurs in each column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element corresponds to a diagonal or some other structure. Another thought: the output could be the counts of occurrences of the pattern \"2,2\" in each column. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, let's look for columns that have 2,2. For example, column 4 (index 4 if starting from 0) in the first row is 2. Let's check each column across all rows:\n\nLooking at each column in Example 0:\n\nColumn 0: 0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0 \u2192 no 2s. \nColumn 1: 0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1 \u2192 no 2s.\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0 \u2192 Wait, column 2 for row 4 is 2, and row 5 has 2? Let me check. Wait, each row is a list. Let's clarify. Each row is a list of 9 elements, so each row is a row in the grid. So columns are vertical.\n\nLet me take each column in the input grid and check for consecutive 2s. For example, in Example 0:\n\nLooking at column 4 (5th column, index 4):\n\nRow 0: 2\nRow 1: 2\nRow 2: 0\nRow 3: 0\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7: 0\nRow 8: 0\n\nWait, that's not consecutive. Wait, maybe the 2,2 is in the same row. For example, in the first row of Example 0, there's 2,2 at positions 4 and 5. So maybe each row is checked for the presence of 2,2 or 1,1 sequences, and the output counts how many times these occur in certain positions.\n\nWait the output lengths are 5. Maybe the output is for each of the middle five rows (rows 2-6?), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the count of 1,1 pairs in each column. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first two elements are 1,1. So maybe columns 0 and 1 have a 1,1 sequence. Let me check columns:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nColumn 1: values across rows are [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1]. So rows 1 and 2 have 1,1. So that's a consecutive 1,1. Then column 2: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0]. Rows 1 and 2 are 1,1 again. So columns 1 and 2 have two 1,1 pairs. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Hmm, maybe the output is the number of times a 1,1 occurs in each row? Let's check.\n\nLooking at Example 0's rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1] \u2192 has 2,2 \u2192 maybe not counted here.\nRow 1: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 has 1,1 and 2,2.\nRow 2: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 1,1 and 2,2.\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 2,2.\nRow 4: [1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 2,2.\nRow 5: [0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0] \u2192 2,2 and 1,1.\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0] \u2192 1,1.\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 nothing.\nRow 8: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 nothing.\n\nNow, if we count for each row whether it contains a 1,1 or 2,2 sequence. Then for the output, maybe each position in the output represents the count of such sequences in a certain group of rows.\n\nBut the output is length 5, and there are 9 rows. Maybe grouping rows into pairs? Let's see.\n\nBut Example 0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So maybe for the first two groups (rows 0-1, 2-3, etc.), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of 1,1 pairs in each column. Wait in Example 0's output, the first two are 1s. Let's check columns 0 and 1.\n\nIn column 1 of Example 0: rows 1 and 2 are 1,1. So that's one occurrence. Column 2: rows 1 and 2 are 1,1 again. So column 2 also has one. But the output starts with two 1s. So maybe the output counts the number of 1,1 pairs in the first five columns? Because the output has five elements. So columns 0-4?\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nColumn 0: no 1,1.\nColumn 1: has 1,1 once (rows 1 and 2).\nColumn 2: 1,1 once (rows 1 and 2).\nColumn 3: no.\nColumn 4: 2,2 in rows 0,1,4,5, etc. But the output counts 1s and 0s. Maybe the output is the count of 1,1 pairs in each of the first five columns.\n\nIn Example 0, columns 1 and 2 have 1,1. So output would have 1 in positions 1 and 2. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. That would fit if the output is for columns 0-4. Column 1: 1 occurrence, column 2: 1 occurrence. But the output's first two elements are 1,1, which would correspond to columns 0 and 1. Wait, that doesn't align. Maybe the output is the count of 1,1 in columns 0-4. So columns 0: 0, 1:1, 2:1, 3:0,4:0. Then output [0,1,1,0,0], but the actual output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each element in the output corresponds to a row, but only for the middle five rows. Let's see. Example 0's output is 5 elements. The input has 9 rows. So maybe rows 2-6 (the middle five rows). Let's check each of those rows for a certain pattern.\n\nLooking at rows 2-6 in Example 0:\n\nRow 2: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 has 1,1 and 2,2. So maybe counts two?\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2] \u2192 2,2.\nRow 4: [1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 2,2.\nRow5: [0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0] \u2192 2,2 and 1,1.\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0] \u2192 1,1.\n\nNow, how to get the output [1,1,0,0,0] from these. Each output element corresponds to a row in 2-6. If the output is 1 if the row has both a 1,1 and a 2,2, otherwise 0. But row 2 has both, row3 has 2,2, row4 has 2,2, row5 has both, row6 has 1,1. Then maybe the output counts whether there's a 1,1 in the row. So rows 2,5,6 have 1,1. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the output is 1 if the row contains a 2,2. Then rows 2,3,4,5 have 2,2. So for the five middle rows, the count would be 4 ones, but the output is two 1s. Not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe each output element is the number of consecutive pairs (1,1 or 2,2) in each column. For example, in each column, count how many times a pair (1,1 or 2,2) occurs, then the output is the counts for the first five columns. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nColumns 0-4:\n\nColumn0: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 no consecutive pairs.\n\nColumn1: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 one pair (1,1) at rows 1-2.\n\nColumn2: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 two pairs: 1,1 at rows 1-2 and 2,2 at rows4-5.\n\nWait, but for column2, the 2,2 is in rows 4 and 5? Let me check:\n\nRow4 in Example0 is [1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. So column3 and column4 of row4 are 2,2 (assuming columns are zero-based). Wait, row4's elements are [1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. So column2 is 2, column3 is 2. So in column2, row4 is 2, but row5's column2 is 2 (row5 is [0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0] \u2192 column2 is 2). So rows4 and5 in column2 are 2,2. So column2 has two pairs: 1,1 and 2,2. But how would that translate into counts?\n\nBut the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. If each output element is the count for columns 0-4:\n\nColumn0: 0 pairs.\n\nColumn1: 1 pair (1,1).\n\nColumn2: 2 pairs (1,1 and 2,2).\n\nColumn3: In column3:\n\nLooking at rows for column3 in Example0:\n\nRows are: 0:0, 1:0, 2:0, 3:0,4:2,5:2,6:0,7:0,8:0.\n\nSo in column3, rows4 and5 are 2,2 \u2192 one pair.\n\nSo column3 has one pair.\n\nColumn4: In rows, column4:\n\nRow0:2, row1:2, row2:0, row3:0, row4:0, row5:0, row6:0, row7:0, row8:0.\n\nSo rows0 and1 have 2,2 \u2192 one pair.\n\nSo columns0-4 would have counts 0,1,2,1,1. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. That doesn't match.\n\nHmm, this isn't working. Let's look at another example. Example1's output is [1,1,1,1,0]. So five 1s except the last. Let's check if there's a pattern in the columns.\n\nIn Example1, looking at columns 0-4:\n\nColumn0: values across rows:\n\nRow0:1, row1:1, row2:0, row3:0, row4:0, row5:0, row6:0, row7:0, row8:0.\n\nSo column0 has 1,1 in rows0 and1 \u2192 one pair.\n\nColumn1: rows0:1, row1:1, row2:0, row3:0, row4:1, row5:1, row6:0, row7:0, row8:1.\n\nSo pairs in rows0-1 (1,1), rows4-5 (1,1), so two pairs.\n\nBut the output's second element is 1, so perhaps only the first occurrence is counted?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each column is checked for having at least one pair. For example, in Example1:\n\nColumns0: has a pair (1,1). Column1: has two pairs. Column2: let's see. Column2 in Example1's rows:\n\nRow0:0, row1:0, row2:0, row3:0, row4:1, row5:1, row6:0, row7:0, row8:0.\n\nSo rows4-5 have 1,1 \u2192 one pair. So column2 has a pair.\n\nColumn3: looking for pairs. Column3 in Example1's rows:\n\nRow0:2, row1:0, row2:2, row3:0, row4:0, row5:0, row6:0, row7:2, row8:2.\n\nSo rows7-8 have 2,2 \u2192 one pair. So column3 has a pair.\n\nColumn4: let's see. Column4 in Example1:\n\nRow0:0, row1:0, row2:0, row3:0, row4:2, row5:2, row6:0, row7:2, row8:2.\n\nSo rows4-5:2,2; rows7-8:2,2 \u2192 two pairs. So column4 has two pairs.\n\nIf the output counts whether each column (0-4) has at least one pair, then for Example1, columns0-4 all have at least one pair. So output would be [1,1,1,1,1], but the actual output is [1,1,1,1,0]. Hmm, conflicting.\n\nWait the output for Example1 is [1,1,1,1,0]. So column4 (fourth element) is 0. But column4 has pairs. So maybe the output isn't based on columns.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is related to the number of times 2,2 or 1,1 appears in each diagonal. For example, the main diagonals or anti-diagonals. Let's think.\n\nIn a 9x9 grid, there are diagonals. For example, the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and other diagonals. But the output has 5 elements. Perhaps counting for each of the five central diagonals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element represents the count of consecutive pairs (like 1,1 or 2,2) in each of the five middle rows. For example, in each middle row (rows 2-6), check if there's a pair. But in Example0's output, the first two elements are 1,1. Let's check the middle rows (rows 2-6):\n\nRow2: has 1,1 and 2,2 \u2192 maybe counts as 1 if either exists?\nRow3: has 2,2 \u2192 1?\nRow4: has 2,2 \u2192 1?\nRow5: has 2,2 and 1,1 \u2192 1?\nRow6: has 1,1 \u2192 1?\n\nSo for five rows, all would be 1, but output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output is the count of 1,1 pairs in each of the first five rows, and 2,2 pairs in the next five rows. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example2's output: [1,1,1,1,0]. Let's see. The input for Example2 has various 2,2 and 1,1 pairs. For example, row0 has 2,2, row1 has 2,2 and 1,1 at the end, etc. But how does that translate to the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the parity (even or odd) of the number of pairs in each row, but the outputs don't seem to align.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs again. Example0: [1,1,0,0,0]. Example1: [1,1,1,1,0]. Example2: [1,1,1,1,0]. The last element is often 0. Maybe the output is counting something like the number of 1,1 or 2,2 pairs in specific positions.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps each row is divided into overlapping triplets, and the output is the count of triplets that contain two consecutive 1s or 2s. But the output is length 5, which might not fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of times a specific pattern occurs in each of the first five columns. For example, in column0, if there's a 1 followed by a 1 in consecutive rows, then output[0] is incremented. Similarly for other columns.\n\nLet's check Example0:\n\nColumns0-4:\n\nColumn0 in Example0:\n\nRows are 0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0. So pairs in consecutive rows:\n\nRows0-1: 0-0 \u2192 not 1,1 or 2,2.\n\nRows1-2: 0-0 \u2192 no.\n\nNo pairs here. So column0 has 0 pairs. But output starts with 1,1.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of certain patterns in each of the first five rows. For example, each output element is 1 if the row has a 1,1 or 2,2, else 0. Then for Example0's first five rows:\n\nRow0: 2,2 \u2192 1.\n\nRow1: 1,1 and 2,2 \u2192 1.\n\nRow2: 1,1 and 0,0 \u2192 1 (has 1,1).\n\nRow3: 2,2 \u2192 1.\n\nRow4: 2,2 \u2192 1.\n\nBut the output is [1,1,0,0,0], which would require five 1s if this were the case, but it's not. So this idea is invalid.\n\nWait, but the output length is 5. Maybe the output corresponds to the five central columns (columns 2-6, maybe). Let's check.\n\nExample0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Let's see columns 2-6 in Example0:\n\nColumn2: has 1,1 and 2,2 \u2192 two pairs. Column3: 0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0 \u2192 has 2,2. Column4: 2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 2,2 in rows0-1. Column5: 2,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0 \u2192 2,2 and 1,1. Column6: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 nothing. So for columns2-6, the pairs are 2, 1, 1, 2, 0. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: Looking for the number of 1,1 and 2,2 pairs in the entire grid, then mapping them to the output. For example, each output element is the number of such pairs in a certain quadrant. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output represents the presence of a 1,1 or 2,2 pair in each of the five middle rows (rows 2-6). For each row, if there's a pair, output 1, else 0. Let's check:\n\nExample0's rows 2-6:\n\nRow2: has 1,1 and 2,2 \u2192 1.\n\nRow3: has 2,2 \u2192 1.\n\nRow4: has 2,2 \u2192 1.\n\nRow5: has 2,2 and 1,1 \u21921.\n\nRow6: has 1,1 \u21921.\n\nSo output would be [1,1,1,1,1]. But the actual output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is related to the number of times a pair (1,1 or 2,2) appears in each of the five 3x3 subgrids. But the input is 9x9, so divided into 9 3x3 subgrids. But the output is five elements. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of pairs (1,1 or 2,2) in each of the first five rows of the input. Let's check Example0:\n\nFirst five rows:\n\nRow0: 2,2 \u2192 count as 1.\n\nRow1: 1,1 and 2,2 \u2192 count as 2.\n\nRow2: 1,1 \u2192 count as 1.\n\nRow3: 2,2 \u2192 count as1.\n\nRow4: 2,2 \u2192 count as1.\n\nTotal for each row: [1,2,1,1,1]. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of pairs in each diagonal of the grid. Let's think. The main diagonals. For example, the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). But with a 9x9 grid, there are 17 diagonals. The output is five elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of pairs in each of the five layers or something. Not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the count of 1s in certain positions. For example, in each row of the input, the number of 1s in the first five positions. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Let's check the first five rows' first five elements:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,2] \u2192 0 ones.\n\nRow1: [0,1,1,0,2] \u2192 two 1s.\n\nRow2: [0,1,1,0,0] \u2192 two 1s.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 0.\n\nRow4: [1,0,2,2,0] \u2192 one 1.\n\nIf the output is the sum of 1s in each row's first five elements, but the output is per row. But Example0's output has five elements. Maybe each element corresponds to a row. But in this case, the first five rows would have sums 0,2,2,0,1. Not matching [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the test input and see if any patterns emerge. The test input's rows are:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,1]\n\nRow1: [1,1,0,1,0,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,2,2,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\n\nRow7: [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,0]\n\nRow8: [2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking for pairs in rows. For example, row0 has 2,2. Row1 has 1,1 and 2,2. Row2 has 1,1. Row3 has 1,1. Row4 has 2,2 and 1,1. Row5 has 2,2. Row6 has 2,2. Row7 has 2,2 and 1,1 and 2,2 again. Row8 has 2,2 and 1,1.\n\nBut how does this relate to the output? The output needs to be five elements. Let's see what the training examples do.\n\nIn Example0's output, the first two are 1s. In that input, the first two columns (columns1 and 2) have 1,1 pairs. Maybe the output counts for each of the first five columns whether there's a pair in that column. So for each column, if there's at least one 1,1 or 2,2 pair in consecutive rows, then output 1, else 0.\n\nLet's test this for Example0:\n\nColumns0-4:\n\nColumn0: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 no pairs.\n\nColumn1: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 has 1,1 in rows1-2 \u2192 1.\n\nColumn2: [0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 has 1,1 in rows1-2 and 2,2 in rows4-5 \u2192 two pairs. But the output only cares if there's at least one \u2192 1.\n\nColumn3: [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0] \u2192 rows4-5:2,2 \u2192 1.\n\nColumn4: [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 rows0-1:2,2 \u2192 1.\n\nSo columns0-4 would be [0,1,1,1,1], but the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's counting the number of columns (among the first five) that have a pair. For Example0, columns1,2,3,4 have pairs, totaling 4. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0], which sums to 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of pairs in each of the first five rows. For Example0:\n\nRow0: 2,2 \u2192 1.\n\nRow1: 1,1 and 2,2 \u2192 2.\n\nRow2: 1,1 \u21921.\n\nRow3: 2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow4: 2,2 \u21921.\n\nBut the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. This doesn't align.\n\nHmm. Let me think differently. The output lengths are 5. The training examples have outputs with 1s and 0s. Maybe it's a binary representation, but the numbers don't fit. For example, Example0's output is 11000 in binary, which is 24 in decimal, but I don't see how that connects.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the count of 1,1 pairs in the first five rows and the count of 2,2 pairs in the next four rows. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element corresponds to the presence of a 1,1 or 2,2 pair in each of the five middle columns (columns 2-6). For each of these columns, check if there's at least one pair. Let's see.\n\nExample0's columns2-6:\n\nColumn2: has pairs \u2192 1.\n\nColumn3: has pairs \u2192 1.\n\nColumn4: has pairs \u21921.\n\nColumn5: has pairs \u21921.\n\nColumn6: no pairs \u21920.\n\nSo output would be [1,1,1,1,0]. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of 2,2 pairs in the first five rows and 1,1 pairs in the last four. Not sure.\n\nLet's think about the outputs:\n\nExample0: [1,1,0,0,0]\n\nExample1: [1,1,1,1,0]\n\nExample2: [1,1,1,1,0]\n\nLooking at these, the first two examples have the first four elements as 1s in Example1 and 2, but Example0 has two 1s. What's common in the inputs? Perhaps the output is based on the number of pairs in the entire grid, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number of pairs in each of the five layers of the grid when divided into vertical layers. For example, columns 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8. But that's five elements. For each layer, count the number of pairs.\n\nExample0:\n\nColumns0-1: Looking for pairs in consecutive columns. For example, in rows:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,0,2,2 \u2192 columns0-1: 0,0 \u2192 pair. But how to count across rows?\n\nAlternatively, layers as columns grouped into pairs. Columns 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8 (last as single).\n\nFor each layer (pair of columns), count the number of rows where both columns in the pair have the same value (either 1,1 or 2,2).\n\nExample0:\n\nLayer0 (columns0-1):\n\nLooking for rows where columns0 and1 have the same value and are either 1,1 or 2,2.\n\nRow0:0,0 \u2192 same, but 0,0 not counted. Maybe only 1,1 or 2,2.\n\nRow1:0,1 \u2192 different.\n\nRow2:0,1 \u2192 different.\n\nRow3:0,0 \u2192 same (0,0 not counted).\n\nRow4:1,0 \u2192 different.\n\nRow5:0,0 \u2192 same (0,0).\n\nRow6:0,0 \u2192 same.\n\nRow7:0,0 \u2192 same.\n\nRow8:0,1 \u2192 different.\n\nSo no rows in layer0 have 1,1 or 2,2.\n\nLayer1 (columns2-3):\n\nCheck rows for columns2-3 being 1,1 or 2,2.\n\nRow0:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1:1,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2:1,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow3:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow4:2,2 \u2192 yes (2,2).\n\nRow5:2,2 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow6:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow7:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow8:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo two rows (4 and5) have 2,2 in layer1.\n\nLayer2 (columns4-5):\n\nCheck rows for 4-5.\n\nRow0:2,2 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow1:2,2 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow3:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow4:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow5:0,1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow6:0,1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow7:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow8:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo two rows (0,1) have 2,2 in layer2.\n\nLayer3 (columns6-7):\n\nCheck for 6-7:\n\nRow0:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2:0,2 \u2192 no.\n\nRow3:0,2 \u2192 no.\n\nRow4:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow5:1,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow6:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow7:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow8:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nNo pairs here.\n\nLayer4 (column8):\n\nOnly single column, so maybe ignore. Or check for consecutive pairs in the column.\n\nBut column8 in Example0:\n\nRows:1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,1. So pairs are rows3-4 (2,2). So one pair.\n\nIf the output is the number of pairs in each layer:\n\nLayers0-4: 0, 2, 2, 0, 1. But the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think of another approach. The outputs are lists of five elements. The training examples' outputs have varying numbers of 1s. Maybe each element in the output corresponds to the presence of a certain pattern in the input grid. For example, the first element is 1 if there's a 1,1 pair in the first row, and so on. But the output has five elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output corresponds to the number of 1,1 and 2,2 pairs in each of five regions of the grid. For example, top-left, top-right, middle, bottom-left, bottom-right. But this is speculative.\n\nLooking at Example0's output [1,1,0,0,0], perhaps the first two regions have pairs, the others don't. Let's try:\n\nRegions:\n\n1. Top-left 3x3: rows0-2, columns0-2.\n\nIn Example0's top-left 3x3:\n\nRow0:0,0,0.\n\nRow1:0,1,1.\n\nRow2:0,1,1.\n\nHere, rows1 and 2 have 1,1 pairs in columns1-2. So two pairs (in rows1 and 2). So maybe region1 has pairs.\n\nBut how does this map to the output? The output's first element is 1. So maybe each region is checked for at least one pair. If so, region1 has pairs \u21921.\n\nRegion2: top-middle 3x3.\n\nColumns3-5, rows0-2.\n\nExample0's row0: columns3-5 are 0,0,0. Row1: 0,2,2. Row2:0,0,0. So in row1, columns3-5 have 0,2,2 \u2192 2,2 pair. So region2 has a pair \u21921.\n\nRegion3: middle 3x3 (rows3-5, columns3-5).\n\nExample0's rows3-5 columns3-5:\n\nRow3:0,0,0.\n\nRow4:2,0,0.\n\nRow5:2,0,0.\n\nNo pairs here.\n\nRegion4: bottom-left 3x3 (rows6-8, columns0-2).\n\nExample0's rows6-8 columns0-2:\n\nRow6:0,0,0.\n\nRow7:0,0,0.\n\nRow8:0,1,0.\n\nNo pairs.\n\nRegion5: bottom-right 3x3 (rows6-8, columns6-8).\n\nRow6:0,0,0.\n\nRow7:0,0,0.\n\nRow8:0,0,1.\n\nNo pairs.\n\nSo regions1 and2 have pairs, others don't. So output would be [1,1,0,0,0]. Which matches Example0's output. This seems promising.\n\nLet's check Example1's output [1,1,1,1,0].\n\nExample1's input:\n\nFirst, define the regions:\n\nRegion1 (top-left): rows0-2, columns0-2.\n\nRow0:1,1,0.\n\nRow1:1,1,0.\n\nRow2:0,0,0.\n\nPairs in region1:\n\nRow0:1,1 in columns0-1.\n\nRow1:1,1 in columns0-1.\n\nSo two pairs \u2192 region1 has pairs \u21921.\n\nRegion2 (top-middle): rows0-2, columns3-5.\n\nRow0:2,0,0.\n\nRow1:0,0,1.\n\nRow2:2,0,1.\n\nNo consecutive pairs here.\n\nWait, columns3-5 of rows0-2:\n\nRow0:2,0,0.\n\nRow1:0,0,1.\n\nRow2:2,0,1.\n\nNo pairs. So region2 has no pairs? But Example1's output has second element as 1.\n\nHmm, this contradicts. Maybe my region definition is wrong. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regions are different. Maybe each region is a 3x3 grid starting from different positions.\n\nWait, the grid is 9x9, divided into nine 3x3 subgrids. But the output has five elements. Maybe the five subgrids in the center? For example, the central subgrid and the four surrounding it. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the five regions are the five 3x3 subgrids along the diagonal.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's try to confirm with Example0. If in Example0, the first two regions (top-left and top-middle) have pairs, and the output is [1,1,0,0,0], that matches. But in Example1's output, the first four elements are 1s, suggesting four regions have pairs.\n\nExample1's input:\n\nRegion1 (top-left 3x3):\n\nRow0:1,1,0.\n\nRow1:1,1,0.\n\nRow2:0,0,0.\n\nHere, pairs in rows0 and1 (columns0-1). So region1 has pairs \u21921.\n\nRegion2 (top-middle 3x3: columns3-5, rows0-2):\n\nRow0: columns3-5: 2,0,0 \u2192 no pairs.\n\nRow1: columns3-5:0,0,1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: columns3-5:2,0,1 \u2192 no.\n\nSo region2 has no pairs. But Example1's output second element is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each output element corresponds to the presence of a 1,1 or 2,2 pair in the corresponding row of the input's middle 5 rows. For example, output[0] is 1 if row2 has a pair, output[1] is row3, etc.\n\nIn Example0's middle rows (rows2-6):\n\nRow2: has 1,1 and 2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow3: 2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow4: 2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow5: 2,2 and 1,1 \u21921.\n\nRow6: 1,1 \u21921.\n\nSo output should be five 1s, but actual output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the count of 2,2 pairs in each of the first five columns. Let's check Example0's first five columns:\n\nColumn0: no 2,2.\n\nColumn1: no 2,2.\n\nColumn2: 2,2 in rows4-5.\n\nColumn3: 2,2 in rows4-5.\n\nColumn4: 2,2 in rows0-1.\n\nSo columns2-4 have 2,2 pairs. So output would be [0,0,1,1,1]. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is frustrating. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\nTest Input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,1]\n\nRow1: [1,1,0,1,0,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,2,2,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\n\nRow7: [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,0]\n\nRow8: [2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking for pairs in each row:\n\nRow0: 2,2 \u2192 1.\n\nRow1: 1,1 and 2,2 \u2192 2.\n\nRow2:1,1 \u21921.\n\nRow3:1,1 \u21921.\n\nRow4:2,2 and 1,1 \u2192 2.\n\nRow5:2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow6:2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow7:2,2, 1,1, and 2,2 \u21923.\n\nRow8:2,2 and 1,1 \u21922.\n\nIf the output is the number of pairs in each of the first five rows (rows0-4), it would be [1,2,1,1,2]. But the output examples have 0s and 1s. So perhaps output 1 if there's at least one pair, else 0. Then it would be [1,1,1,1,1]. But the training examples have outputs like [1,1,0,0,0], which don't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of pairs in each of the five middle columns (columns2-6), but not sure.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output might be the number of 2,2 pairs in each of the first five rows, and 1,1 pairs in the next four. But in Example0's output, the first two are 1s. In Example0's first five rows:\n\nRow0:2,2 \u2192 count 1.\n\nRow1:2,2 \u2192 count1.\n\nRow2:0,0 \u21920.\n\nRow3:2,2 \u21921.\n\nRow4:2,2 \u21921.\n\nSo this would give [1,1,0,1,1], but the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be the number of 1,1 pairs in the first five rows. For Example0:\n\nRow0: no.\n\nRow1: yes.\n\nRow2: yes.\n\nRow3: no.\n\nRow4: no.\n\nSo count is 2 \u2192 but output has two 1s. Maybe the output is the presence of 1,1 pairs in the first five rows, each element corresponding to a row. So rows0-4: no, yes, yes, no, no \u2192 output [0,1,1,0,0]. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions where the output has 1s. For Example0's output [1,1,0,0,0], the first two elements are 1. Looking at the input's first two rows. Row0 has 2,2 in positions4-5. Row1 has 1,1 in positions1-2 and 2,2 in positions4-5. Maybe the output counts the presence of pairs in the first two rows and their positions.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the number of pairs in each of the five diagonal stripes. For example, the main diagonal, and then diagonals above and below. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's consider that the output is the count of 1,1 pairs in each of the first five columns, and 2,2 pairs in the next five. But in Example0, the output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Columns0-4:\n\nColumn0: no 1,1 or 2,2.\n\nColumn1: 1,1.\n\nColumn2:1,1 and 2,2.\n\nColumn3:2,2.\n\nColumn4:2,2.\n\nIf the output counts 1,1 pairs in the first five columns, then column1 and 2 have 1,1 pairs \u2192 output [0,1,1,0,0]. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if the output counts 2,2 pairs in columns0-4:\n\nColumn0: no.\n\nColumn1: no.\n\nColumn2: yes (rows4-5).\n\nColumn3: yes (rows4-5).\n\nColumn4: yes (rows0-1).\n\nSo [0,0,1,1,1]. Not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try one more idea. The output might represent the number of times a certain condition is met in each of the five middle columns (columns2-6). For example, if there's a 1,1 or 2,2 pair in that column.\n\nTest for Example0's columns2-6:\n\nColumn2: has 1,1 and 2,2 \u2192 1.\n\nColumn3: has 2,2 \u21921.\n\nColumn4: has 2,2 \u21921.\n\nColumn5: has 2,2 and 1,1 \u21921.\n\nColumn6: no \u21920.\n\nSo output [1,1,1,1,0], but Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. The Test Input has several pairs in the rows. For example, rows0:2,2; row1:1,1 and 2,2; row2:1,1; row3:1,1; row4:2,2 and 1,1; row5:2,2; row6:2,2; row7:2,2 and 1,1 and 2,2; row8:2,2 and 1,1.\n\nThe training examples' outputs are:\n\nExample0: [1,1,0,0,0]\n\nExample1: [1,1,1,1,0]\n\nExample2: [1,1,1,1,0]\n\nThe test input seems to have many pairs. If the output is counting the presence of 1,1 pairs in the first five columns of the first five rows, perhaps:\n\nFor each of the first five rows, check if there's a 1,1 pair in any of the first five columns.\n\nRow0: No 1,1 in first five columns.\n\nRow1: columns0-1 are 1,1.\n\nRow2: columns0-1 are 1,1.\n\nRow3: columns5-6 are 1,1, but outside first five columns.\n\nRow4: columns5-6 are 1,1.\n\nSo for the first five rows, rows1 and2 have 1,1 pairs in first five columns. So output would be [0,1,1,0,0]. But this doesn't match any training example's pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number of times a 1,1 or 2,2 pair starts at columns0,1,2,3,4 in any row. For example, for column0, check if there's a pair starting there (i.e., columns0 and1). For each of the first five columns, count the number of rows where a pair starts at that column.\n\nExample0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Let's see:\n\nColumn0: pairs starting at0 (columns0-1) in any row:\n\nRows0-1:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow5: columns0-1 are0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow7:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo no pairs starting at column0. But output's first element is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother last idea: Maybe the output is the number of times the sequence [1,1] appears in the grid, followed by [2,2], etc., but this seems too vague.\n\nAfter struggling for so long, perhaps the pattern is that the output counts the number of pairs (1,1 or 2,2) in each of the first five columns, but only considering consecutive pairs in the same row. For example, in each column, check if there's any row where that column and the next have a pair. For each of the first five columns, output 1 if there's at least one pair starting at that column.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nColumns0-4:\n\nColumn0: rows0-1 are0,0 (no), rows4-5 (1,0). No pairs starting at column0.\n\nColumn1: rows1-2 are1,1 \u2192 pair starts at column1.\n\nColumn2: rows1-2 are1,1 \u2192 pair starts at column1, not2.\n\nWait, this approach isn't working. For each column c, look at pairs in c and c+1.\n\nExample0:\n\nColumn0: pairs in rows0-1, columns0-1:0,0 \u21920,0 (no).\n\nColumn1: pairs in rows1-2, columns1-2:1,1 \u2192 yes.\n\nColumn2: pairs in rows4-5, columns2-3:2,2 \u2192 yes.\n\nColumn3: pairs in rows4-5, columns3-4:2,0 \u2192 no.\n\nColumn4: pairs in rows0-1, columns4-5:2,2 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo for the first five columns (0-4), the pairs start at columns1,2,4. So output [0,1,1,0,1]. But Example0's output is [1,1,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Based on the training examples and the test input, perhaps the output is [1,1,1,1,0], similar to Examples1 and2. But why?\n\nLooking at the Test Input's rows, there are many pairs. For example, rows0:2,2; row1:1,1 and 2,2; row2:1,1; row3:1,1; row4:2,2 and 1,1; row5:2,2; row6:2,2; row7:2,2, 1,1, 2,2; row8:2,2 and 1,1.\n\nIf the output is based on the number of pairs in each of the first five columns, considering both 1,1 and 2,2, then for the test input:\n\nColumns0-4:\n\nColumn0:\n\nLooking for pairs in the same row starting here:\n\nRow1: 1,1 in columns0-1 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2:1,1 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow7:2,2 \u2192 no, columns0-1 are2,2 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo column0 has three pairs.\n\nBut output is five elements, each possibly 1 if there's at least one pair. So columns0 has pairs \u21921.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow1: columns1-2:1,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: columns1-2:1,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow7: columns1-2:2,0 \u2192 no.\n\nRow8: columns1-2:2,0 \u2192 no.\n\nOther rows:\n\nRow0: columns1-2:0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo column1 has no pairs. But row0 has 0,0 in columns1-2, which is not counted.\n\nBut wait, in row1, columns0-1 are1,1, which starts at column0, not1. So column1 may not have pairs starting there.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time I've spent and the possible patterns, I'll guess that the output is [1,1,1,1,0], similar to Examples1 and2, because the test input has many pairs in various rows and columns.",
