        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples and then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by carefully analyzing the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input and output are both 15x15 grids. Let me compare them row by row. The input has mostly 8s and some 6s arranged in certain patterns. The output introduces 3s and 4s as well. Hmm. Let's take a closer look.\n\nIn the input of Example 0, the 6s form some shapes. For instance, rows 2-6 have a sort of rectangle or maybe a square with 6s. In the output, those areas have 3s surrounding 6s and 4s inside. Wait, maybe it's like adding layers around the 6s. Let me check specific positions.\n\nTake row 3 in the input: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8]. The output row 3 is [8,8,3,3,3,3,8,3,6,4,4,6,3,8,8]. So the original 6s are still there, but surrounded by 4s and 3s. It looks like each 6 in the input is being replaced by a structure where 6 is at the center, surrounded by 4s, and then 3s forming a border around them. Also, the 8s around the original 6s are being replaced by 3s, creating a sort of outline.\n\nWait, but how exactly? Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain 8s adjacent to 6s with 3s, and then inserting 4s where the original 6s are surrounded by other 6s? Or perhaps it's a matter of creating a border around the 6s. Let me check another part.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 4: [8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8]. The output row 4 is [8,8,3,6,6,3,8,3,6,4,4,6,3,8,8]. Here, the 6s in the input are now surrounded by 3s on the sides, and the 8s adjacent to the 6s become 3s. Also, the 6s that were in the middle are now adjacent to 4s. Maybe the 4s are placed where the original 6s are, but only if they're surrounded by other 6s? Or perhaps the 4s are a layer inside the 6s, which are then surrounded by 3s.\n\nLooking at another example. Example 1's input and output. The input has 6s forming different shapes. The output again has 3s and 4s. For instance, in the input row 3: [8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8]. The output row 3 is [8,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6,6,3,8,8,8]. So here, the 6s are surrounded by 3s. Also, some of the 8s adjacent to 6s become 3s. The 4s appear where there might be inner parts of the 6 structures. Like in the input row 4 of Example 1, the 8s are replaced by 4s when they are inside a 6 structure. Wait, in row 4 of Example 1's input: [8,8,6,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. The output row 4 is [8,3,6,4,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8]. So the 8 that was between the 6s is replaced by a 4. That makes me think that 4s are replacing 8s that are completely surrounded by 6s in all four directions (up, down, left, right), but maybe not. Alternatively, 4s could be in positions where the original cell was 8 but is now enclosed by 6s and 3s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each original 6 becomes a 4, and then surrounding 8s become 3s, but that doesn't fit exactly. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is adding a border of 3s around the 6s and replacing certain 6s with 4s. For example, in the input, wherever there's a 6, check its neighbors. If a 6 is surrounded by other 6s in all directions (forming a solid block), then replace the center 6 with a 4. Then, around the entire 6 (and 4) structure, add a layer of 3s by replacing adjacent 8s with 3s.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input row 2: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8]. The output row 2 is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,6,6,3,8,8]. So the 6s are now surrounded by 3s on both ends. Also, in rows 4-5 of the input, the 6s form a vertical line. In the output, those are surrounded by 3s on the top and bottom, and the 6s adjacent to 8s become 3s. The 4s are in positions where the 6s were in the input but perhaps in a cross shape? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves creating a border around each contiguous block of 6s. The 3s form a one-cell thick border around the 6s, replacing the 8s that are adjacent. Then, within the 6 blocks, any 6 that is not on the edge (i.e., surrounded by 6s on all sides) becomes a 4. But how to determine that.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input row 5: [8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8]. The output row 5 is [8,8,3,6,6,3,8,3,6,4,4,6,3,8,8]. So the two 6s in columns 4 and 5 (input) become 6s in the output, but the 6s in columns 9 and 12 (input) are now adjacent to 4s. Wait, in the input, the 6s in columns 9 and 12 are single? No, looking at input row 4 and 5, perhaps there's a vertical line of 6s. Wait, input row 4: [8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8]. So columns 9 and 12 have 6s, but in row 4 and 5, perhaps they are part of a vertical line. If so, maybe those 6s are on the edge, so they remain 6, but the inner parts (if any) become 4s. But in the output, the 6 at position 9 in row 4 is followed by 8s, so maybe that's a vertical line. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the output's 3s as a border around the 6s, and 4s as the inner part of the 6s. So for every group of contiguous 6s in the input, the output replaces the perimeter 6s with 3s and the inner 6s with 4s. Wait, but in Example 0's output, some 6s remain. For instance, in row 2 of the output, it's [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,6,6,3,8,8]. The 6s are still there. So maybe the 3s are surrounding the 6s, not replacing them. Then the 4s are added inside the 6 structures where possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the 3s are added in the 8s that are adjacent to 6s. So any 8 that is adjacent (including diagonally?) to a 6 becomes a 3. Then, any 6 that is adjacent only to other 6s (i.e., not on the edge) becomes a 4. Let me test this hypothesis.\n\nTake Example 0's input row 3: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8]. The 6s are at positions 8 and 11. The output row 3 is [8,8,3,3,3,3,8,3,6,4,4,6,3,8,8]. So the 8s around the 6s become 3s. The original 6s remain, but between them (positions 9 and 10) are 4s. Wait, but in the input, those positions were 8s. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the 4s are added in the original 8 positions that are surrounded by 6s. Wait, in row 3 of the input, the 6s are at 8 and 11. Between them are 8s. But in the output, those 8s are replaced by 4s. So how? That would suggest that the 8s between two 6s horizontally become 4s. But that's not possible because there are 8s in between. Unless there's a vertical component as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a diamond-shaped pattern. Let's see. The 4s might be placed where a 6 in the input has 6s in all four directions (up, down, left, right). But in Example 0's input, the 6s form a horizontal line in row 2. The 4s in the output are in the middle of that line. So if a 6 is part of a horizontal line of at least 4, the middle ones become 4s. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves creating a border of 3s around the 6s, and replacing the 6s that are in the interior (i.e., surrounded by other 6s) with 4s. For example, in a solid block of 6s, the outermost layer remains 6s, and the inner ones become 4s, but in the examples, the output has 6s still present. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, there's a horizontal line of four 6s in row 2. In the output, those become 6s with 3s on either end. But in row 3 of the input, there's a 6 at position 8 and 11, separated by 8s. In the output, those 6s are now surrounded by 4s. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each 6 in the input is replaced by a 4, and the 8s adjacent to 6s become 3s. But in the output, there are still 6s. So that can't be it.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input row 4: [8,8,6,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. The output row 4 is [8,3,6,4,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8]. The original 6s in positions 2,4,5 are now 6,4,6,6. So the middle 8 is replaced by 4. That suggests that if a cell is 8 and is surrounded by 6s in some way, it becomes a 4. But how?\n\nWait, in the input row 4 of Example 1, the cell at position 3 (0-based?) is 8. In the output, it's 4. Looking at the neighboring cells in the input: left is 6 (position 2), right is 6 (position 4), up is 8, down is 8. So maybe if an 8 is horizontally between two 6s, it becomes a 4. But then in Example 0's input row 3, between two 6s there were 8s, which in the output became 4s. That fits. So perhaps horizontal adjacency: any 8 that is between two 6s horizontally (left and right) becomes a 4, and vertical adjacency: 8s between two 6s vertically become 4s? Or maybe 8s that are surrounded by 6s in any four directions (up, down, left, right) become 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a matter of creating a cross shape. For each 6 in the input, the output replaces the 6 with a 4 and adds 3s around. But again, not sure.\n\nLet's try to outline possible steps based on examples:\n\n1. Identify regions of 6s in the input.\n2. For each 6, check if it's on the edge of the region. If yes, leave it as 6. If it's inside, change to 4.\n3. Then, for all 8s adjacent to any 6 (or 4?), replace them with 3s.\n\nBut how to determine the edge vs. interior. For example, in a line of 6s, the middle ones would be considered interior. Let's check Example 0's input row 2: four 6s in a row. In the output, they remain 6s, but in the next row (row 3 of input), the 6s are separated by 8s. In the output row 3, those 6s are surrounded by 4s. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are added around the entire perimeter of the 6 regions. Then, any 8 that is adjacent to a 6 becomes a 3. Then, within the 6 regions, certain 6s are replaced with 4s. For example, if a 6 has four 6s around it (up, down, left, right), it becomes a 4. But in Example 0's row 2, the four 6s in a line would have the middle two having neighbors on left and right. So they might be replaced by 4s. But in the output, they are still 6s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output row 2, the four 6s are still 6s. So perhaps the 4s are only added where there's a 6 that is part of a 2x2 block. For instance, in Example 1's input row 3, there's a block of 6s. The output might have 4s in the center. Let me check Example 1's output row 3: [8,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6,6,3,8,8,8]. So the 6s are still there, no 4s. Hmm. Then where do the 4s come from?\n\nLooking at Example 1's output row 4: [8,3,6,4,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8]. The 4 is at position 3. In the input row 4, that was an 8. So the 8 became a 4. That 8 was between 6s horizontally. So maybe 8s that are between two 6s horizontally or vertically become 4s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are part of a diamond pattern created by expanding the 6s. Like, each 6 in the input is the center of a diamond, and the surrounding cells become 3s and 4s. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s form a border around the 6s, and any 6 that is adjacent to a 3 becomes a 4. Wait, but in Example 0's output, some 6s are adjacent to 3s and remain 6s.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to look for another angle. The output grids have 3s and 4s added in specific patterns. The input grids have 6s and 8s. So the transformation involves adding these new numbers. Let's see the differences between input and output.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 6s form certain shapes. The output adds 3s around those shapes and places 4s inside. So maybe the process is:\n\n- For each 6 in the input, check if it's part of a larger structure. If it's on the edge, keep it as 6. If it's inside, change to 4.\n- Then, for all 8s that are adjacent to any 6 (original or 4), replace them with 3s.\n\nBut determining edge vs interior is tricky. Alternatively, the 3s are added as a one-pixel outline around the 6s, and 4s are added where there's a 6 with another 6 in a certain direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are added in a way that creates a shadow or outline around the original 6 shapes. Then, the 4s are added as highlights inside.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the 3s form a border around the 6 structures. The 4s are placed in positions where the original 6s were, but perhaps only in certain configurations. For example, in row 4 of the input, there's a vertical line of 6s. In the output, those 6s are now surrounded by 3s and 4s. The middle positions become 4s. So maybe for vertical or horizontal lines of 6s longer than a certain length, the inner 6s become 4s, and the outer ones remain 6s, with 3s around.\n\nAlternatively, it's a matter of expanding the 6s into 3s and 4s. For example, each 6 in the input becomes a 4, and then surrounding 8s become 3s. But in that case, the output would have 4s replacing all 6s, but the examples show that some 6s remain. So perhaps it's more complex.\n\nAnother approach: let's compare the input and output coordinates. Let's take a specific cell in the input and see how it's transformed.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 3, column 8 (0-based? Let's assume rows and columns start at 0):\n\nInput row 3, column 8: 6. Output row 3, column 8: 6. So it remains a 6. But in the output, columns 9 and 10 (originally 8s) are now 4s. So the 6 at column 8 is adjacent to 4s. So the 4s are in positions that were 8s in the input but are now between 6s. Like, if two 6s are separated by 8s, those 8s become 4s. But how? For example, in row 3 of Example 0's input: 6 at column 8 and 11. The 8s in columns 9 and 10 become 4s. So, when two 6s are horizontally separated by 8s, those 8s become 4s. Similarly, if vertically separated. But how far apart? Only if they are adjacent? Or two apart?\n\nWait, in row 3 of the input, the 6s are at columns 8 and 11, separated by two 8s. But in the output, those two 8s become 4s. So maybe whenever there's a 6 on both ends horizontally (or vertically) and 8s in between, those 8s become 4s. But that's a stretch. How would that apply to other examples?\n\nIn Example 1's input row 4, column 3 is 8. In the output, it's 4. Looking at the input, that 8 is between a 6 (left) and a 6 (right). So maybe the rule is that any 8 that is between two 6s horizontally or vertically becomes a 4. Additionally, any 8 adjacent to a 6 (diagonally or not) becomes a 3.\n\nSo steps could be:\n\n1. For each cell in the input:\n   a. If it's 8 and has at least one neighboring 6 (including diagonally?), change it to 3.\n   b. Additionally, if it's 8 and is between two 6s in a line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), change it to 4 instead.\n\nBut how to define \"between two 6s in a line\". For example, in Example 0's row 3, the 8s between the two 6s horizontally become 4s. In Example 1's row 4, the 8 between two 6s horizontally becomes a 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s are placed where an 8 is surrounded by 6s on two opposite sides (left and right, up and down). Then, those 8s become 4s. And all other 8s adjacent to 6s become 3s.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 3, columns 9 and 10 are 8s between two 6s (columns 8 and 11). So they would become 4s. That's what the output shows.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 4, column 3 is 8 between 6s on left and right (columns 2 and 4). So it becomes a 4. That fits.\n\nAnother example: in Example 1's input row 3, there's a block of 6s. The 8s adjacent to them would become 3s. But the 6s themselves may have 4s if they are surrounded by other 6s. Wait, but in the output, some 6s remain.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Replace all 8s adjacent to any 6 (including diagonally) with 3s.\n2. Additionally, replace any 8 that is between two 6s horizontally or vertically with a 4, overriding the previous step.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's row 3, the 8s between 6s are replaced by 4s. The 3s are around the entire structure. So maybe:\n\n- First, mark all 8s adjacent to 6s as 3s.\n- Then, check for 8s that are between two 6s in a straight line (horizontal or vertical), and replace those with 4s.\n\nBut in this case, the 4s would overwrite the 3s in those positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are part of a separate process. Let's see:\n\n- All 8s adjacent to 6s become 3s.\n- Then, within the areas covered by 3s, any cell that is surrounded by 3s (or 6s?) in a cross shape (up, down, left, right) becomes a 4. No, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are added where there were 6s in the input, but only if they are part of certain patterns. But this is unclear.\n\nLet's try to apply the initial hypothesis to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nLooking at the test input, it's a 15x15 grid. Let's look for 6s. The third row (index 2) has [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8]. Then row 3 (index 3) has 6,6,6,6 in the middle. Rows 4-6 have 6s forming a kind of square with a hole. Later rows also have 6s arranged in lines and blocks.\n\nAccording to the initial hypothesis, we need to replace 8s adjacent to 6s with 3s, and 8s between two 6s (horizontally or vertically) with 4s.\n\nLet's take the third row of the test input: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8]. The 6s are in columns 9-11. The 8s to their left and right would become 3s. However, the 8s between the 6s are already 6s, so no 4s here. So the output row would have 3s around the 6s. For example, columns 8 and 12 would be 3s.\n\nWait, but the original 6s are in 9-11. The 8s next to them (columns 8 and 12) become 3s. So the output row would be [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,6,3,8,8].\n\nThen, looking at row 3 of the test input: [8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8]. The 6s form two groups: columns 2-5 and 9-11. The 8s around them would become 3s. But between these groups, there's a gap of 8s. So the 8s adjacent to any 6 become 3s. For example, the 8s at columns 6-7 and 8 would be adjacent to the first group of 6s (columns 2-5). So those would become 3s. Similarly, the 8s around the second group (columns 9-11) would also become 3s. But between the two groups, perhaps there's overlap.\n\nBut this is getting complex. Let's try to think of a step-by-step process.\n\n1. First, create a grid of 3s wherever there's an 8 adjacent to a 6 (including diagonally).\n2. Then, check each cell that was originally an 8. If it's now a 3 and is between two 6s horizontally or vertically, change it to a 4.\n\nSo, for example, in the test input row 4: [8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8]. The 6s are at columns 2,5,9,11. The 8s between them (columns 3-4, 6-8,10,12) become 3s. But the 8s between columns 2 and 5 (columns 3 and 4) are between two 6s horizontally. So those would become 4s. Similarly, the 8s between 9 and 11 (column 10) is between two 6s horizontally, so becomes a 4.\n\nSo the output row 4 would have 3s around the 6s, but the 8s between the 6s become 4s. For example, the 6 at column 2 is followed by 8s (columns 3 and 4) then another 6 at column 5. So columns 3 and 4 would be 4s, and surrounded by 3s elsewhere.\n\nApplying this logic to the entire test input, the output would have 3s forming a border around the 6s and 4s where 8s were between two 6s in a line.\n\nBut to confirm, let's look at the training examples again. For Example 0's row 3 input: 6s at columns 8 and 11, with 8s in between. In the output, those 8s are replaced by 4s. So our hypothesis holds here.\n\nIn Example 1's row 4 input: 6s at columns 2 and 4, with an 8 in column 3. This 8 becomes a 4 in the output. That fits.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Replace all 8s adjacent to any 6 (including diagonally) with 3s.\n- Then, for any 8 that was replaced with a 3 and is between two 6s horizontally or vertically (i.e., left and right are 6s, or up and down are 6s), replace it with a 4 instead.\n\nThis would explain the patterns in the training examples.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nLet's go through each row of the test input and apply this transformation.\n\nTest Input rows:\n\nRow 0: All 8s. So no 3s or 4s. Output is same as input.\n\nRow 1: Same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8]. The 6s are at columns 9-11. The adjacent 8s (columns 8 and 12) become 3s. The 8s between 6s are already 6s, so no 4s. So output row 2 would be [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,6,3,8,8].\n\nRow 3: [8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8]. The 6s are in columns 2-5 and 9-11. The 8s adjacent to these 6s become 3s. Between the two groups of 6s (columns 6-8), but also check for 8s between 6s in the same line. For example, columns 6-8 are 8s between the two groups. But since they are not between two 6s in a straight line, they become 3s. However, within the first group (columns 2-5), the 6s are contiguous. The 8s around them become 3s. So output row 3 would have 3s around the 6 blocks. Also, columns 6-8 (which are between the two 6 groups) might be 3s. But in the output, perhaps the entire area around the 6s is filled with 3s.\n\nRow 4: [8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8]. The 6s are at columns 2,5,9,11. The 8s between 2 and 5 (columns 3-4) are between two 6s horizontally, so they become 4s. The 8 at column 10 (between 9 and 11) becomes a 4. The other 8s adjacent to 6s become 3s. So output row 4 would be something like [8,8,6,4,4,6,3,3,3,6,4,6,3,8,8].\n\nRow 5: Similar to row 4, so output would be similar.\n\nRow 6: [8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8]. The 6s are columns 2-5,9,11. The 8s between columns 2-5 are contiguous 6s, so adjacent 8s become 3s. The 8s between 9 and 11 (column 10) becomes 4. The rest becomes 3s.\n\nRow 7: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8]. Similar to row 2.\n\nRow 8: All 8s.\n\nRow 9: All 8s.\n\nRow 10: All 8s.\n\nRow 11: [8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8]. The 6s from column 4-10. The adjacent 8s become 3s. But since the 6s are contiguous, there's no 8s between them to become 4s. So output row 11 would have 3s around the 6s.\n\nRow 12: [8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8]. The 6s are columns 4-5, 8-10. The 8s between them (columns 6-7) are adjacent to 6s, so become 3s. Also, between columns 5 and 8 (columns 6-7) are 8s between two groups of 6s, so they become 3s, not 4s because they're not between two 6s in a line. The 8 at column 7 between columns 5 and 8 is adjacent to 6s, so becomes 3.\n\nRow 13: [8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8]. Similar to row 11.\n\nRow 14: All 8s.\n\nPutting this all together, the output would have 3s surrounding all 6s, and 4s where 8s are between two 6s horizontally or vertically. For example, in row 4 of the test input, the two 6s at columns 2 and 5 have 8s in between which become 4s.\n\nNow, let's try to construct the output step by step.\n\nTest Input Row 2: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8]\n\nOutput Row 2: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,6,3,8,8]\n\nTest Input Row 3: [8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8]\n\nThe 6s are in columns 2-5 and 9-11. The adjacent 8s become 3s. For columns 0-1: 8s not adjacent to 6s remain 8. Column 2: 6, remains 6. Columns 3-5: 6s. Columns 6-8: 8s adjacent to 6s (from columns 2-5 and 9-11) become 3s. Columns 9-11: 6s. Columns 12-14: 8s adjacent to 6s (column 11) become 3. So output row 3 would be:\n\n[8,8,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,3,8,8]\n\nBut wait, the 8s at columns 6-8 are adjacent to the 6s at 2-5 (left) and 9-11 (right). So columns 6-8 become 3s. But there's no 8s between two 6s in a line here. So no 4s in this row.\n\nRow 4: [8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8]\n\nThe 6s are at columns 2,5,9,11. The 8s between 2 and 5 (columns 3-4) are between two 6s horizontally. So they become 4s. The 8 at column 10 is between 9 and 11 (columns 9 and 11 are 6s), so becomes a 4. The other adjacent 8s become 3s.\n\nSo output row 4 would be:\n\n[8,8,6,4,4,6,3,3,3,6,4,6,3,8,8]\n\nRow 5: Similar to row 4.\n\nRow 6: [8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8]\n\nThe 6s are columns 2-5, 9, 11. The 8s between 9 and 11 (column 10) becomes 4. The 8s around the 6s become 3s. The contiguous 6s at columns 2-5: their adjacent 8s become 3s, but since they are contiguous, no 4s in between. So output row 6:\n\n[8,8,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,4,6,3,8,8]\n\nRow 7: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8]\n\nSame as row 2's output: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,6,3,8,8]\n\nRow 11: [8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8]\n\nAll 6s are contiguous. The adjacent 8s become 3s around them. So output row 11:\n\n[8,8,8,8,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,8,8]\n\nRow 12: [8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8]\n\nThe 6s are at columns 4-5 and 8-10. The 8s between them (columns 6-7) become 3s. No 4s here. So output row 12:\n\n[8,8,8,8,3,6,3,3,3,6,6,3,8,8,8]\n\nWait, but columns 4-5 are 6s. The 8s adjacent to them (columns 3 and 6) become 3s. Columns 8-10 are 6s, adjacent 8s (columns 7 and 11) become 3s. Columns 6-7 are 8s between two groups of 6s. So they become 3s. So the output would be [8,8,8,8,3,6,3,3,3,6,6,3,8,8,8]. But in the training examples, sometimes the 3s form a border around the entire 6 group. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, the entire block of 6s would have a 3 border. For row 12's input, the 6s are at columns 4-5 and 8-10. The adjacent 8s (columns 3,6,7,11) become 3s. So output row 12 would be:\n\n[8,8,8,8,3,6,3,3,3,6,6,3,8,8,8]\n\nBut in the test input, the 6s in row 12 are at columns 4-5 and 8-10. The 8s between them (columns 6-7) are adjacent to the left group (columns 4-5) and the right group (8-10), so they become 3s. \n\nPutting it all together, the test output would look something like:\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,6,3,8,8]\n[8,8,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,3,8,8]\n[8,8,6,4,4,6,3,3,3,6,4,6,3,8,8]\n[8,8,6,4,4,6,3,3,3,6,4,6,3,8,8]\n[8,8,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,4,6,3,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,6,3,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,3,6,3,3,3,6,6,3,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nBut comparing this to the training examples, I notice that in Example 0's output, the 3s form a continuous border around the 6s. For example, in row 2 of the output in Example 0, the 3s are at the ends of the 6s. Similarly, in the test input's row 3, the 6s are in two separate groups, so each group would have their own 3 borders. So the 8s between the groups become 3s as well, as they are adjacent to either group.\n\nBut how to handle overlapping borders. For instance, if two 6 groups are close, their 3 borders might merge. But according to the examples, this is allowed.\n\nSo the final output for the test input should replace all 8s adjacent to 6s with 3s, and any 8s between two 6s in a line with 4s. Applying this rigorously should give the correct output.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples and then apply that pattern to the test input. Let me start by analyzing the given examples carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 0's input and output. The input has a lot of 8s and some 6s arranged in certain shapes. The output introduces 3s and 4s. I notice that in the output, the 6s are still present but surrounded by 3s, and some 4s appear inside the 6 structures. For instance, in the input's third row, there's a part with 6,8,8,6 which in the output becomes 3,6,4,4,6,3. So maybe the transformation adds layers around the original numbers, replacing 8s with 3s and introducing 4s in the innermost parts.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the input has 6s and 8s. The output again has 3s surrounding the 6 areas, and 4s inside. For example, in the input's 9th row, there's a 6 followed by 8s, which in the output becomes 6 surrounded by 4s and 3s. This suggests that 8s are being converted into 3s when they border 6s, and the innermost parts of the 6 structures become 4s.\n\nSo the pattern might be something like: the original 6 regions are outlined with 3s, and their inner parts are filled with 4s. The 8s adjacent to these 6 regions become 3s, acting as a border. But how exactly?\n\nLet me think of it as layers. The original 6s form a shape. The first layer (immediate neighbors) of 8s around the 6s become 3s. Then, the original 6s that are deeper (maybe the ones not on the edge of the 6 shape) become 4s. Wait, in Example 0's output, the 6s are still present in some areas. For example, in row 2 of the output, the middle part is 6,6,6,6 surrounded by 3s. So maybe only the perimeter of the original 6 shapes remain 6, and the interior 6s become 4s. Then, the 8s adjacent to the 6s become 3s. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the process is as follows: \n\n1. Identify all regions of 6s in the input. \n2. For each 6 cell, if it's on the edge of the 6 region (adjacent to an 8), it stays 6. If it's completely surrounded by 6s, it becomes 4. \n3. Then, replace all 8s that are adjacent to a 6 (original or new) with 3s. \n\nWait, but looking at Example 0's input and output. Let's take a specific part. In the input, there's a horizontal line of four 6s in row 2 (indices 8-11). In the output, these become 6s surrounded by 3s. The same row in the output shows 3,6,6,6,6,3. So perhaps the original 6s are kept, but surrounded by 3s. Wait, but in the input's row 3 (0-based), the line is 6,8,8,6. In the output, it becomes 3,6,4,4,6,3. So the original 6s at the ends stay 6, but the 8s in between become 6s? No, wait. Wait the input row 3 (assuming rows are 0-based) in Example 0 is:\n\nInput row 3 (third row): [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8]\n\nOutput row 3: [8,8,3,3,3,3,8,3,6,4,4,6,3,8,8]\n\nSo the original 6s at positions 8 and 11 (0-based index) in the input row 3 become 6 in the output, but the 8s around them (positions 9,10) become 4s. Wait, but in the output, those positions are 4s. So perhaps the 6s that are adjacent to 8s (the edges) are kept as 6, and any 6s that are surrounded by 6s (i.e., not on the edge) are replaced by 4. Then, the 8s adjacent to the original 6 regions are replaced by 3s.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis. For example, in the input's row 3 of Example 0, the 6s are at positions 8 and 11. Between them are 8s. But in the output, between them are 4s. Wait, how does that happen? Maybe the 8s that are adjacent to 6s become 3s, but the 6s themselves are transformed. Alternatively, maybe the original 6s are part of a larger shape. Let me check the input's row 4 in Example 0:\n\nInput row 4: [8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8]\n\nOutput row 4: [8,8,3,6,6,3,8,3,6,4,4,6,3,8,8]\n\nIn the input row 4, there are two 6s at positions 3 and 4. In the output, those become 6s. The 8s adjacent to those 6s become 3s. The 6s at positions 8 and 11 in input row 4 (original 6s) become 6 in output, but the 8s between them (positions 9 and 10) become 4s. Wait, but in the input, those positions were 8s. So how do they become 4s? That doesn't fit the idea that 8s become 3s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 6 regions are replaced by 4s, surrounded by 3s. Wait, maybe the process is:\n\n- The 8s are the background.\n- Any 6 in the input becomes a 4 if it's surrounded by 6s on all four sides (or adjacent?), else remains 6.\n- Then, all 8s that are adjacent to a 6 (original or new 4) become 3s.\n\nBut this might not explain the layers. Let's look at another part. In Example 0's output row 3, the original 6s at positions 8 and 11 are now 6, but the 8s in between (positions 9,10) became 4s. But in the input, those were 8s. So how? That doesn't align with replacing 6s. Maybe there's a different rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is similar to creating an outline. For each 6 in the input, if it's on the perimeter (adjacent to an 8), it stays 6. If it's inside (surrounded by 6s), it becomes 4. Then, all 8s adjacent to 6s (original or new) become 3s. Let's see.\n\nTake the input row 3 of Example 0: 6,8,8,6. So the two 6s are adjacent to 8s, so they stay 6. The 8s in between would become 3s? But in the output, those positions are 4s. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire 6 regions are first converted into 4s, and then surrounded by 3s. But then the original 6s would all become 4s. But in the output, some 6s remain. So perhaps only the perimeter of the original 6 regions becomes 3s, but that doesn't explain the 4s.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me look at the two training examples and see if there's a common pattern.\n\nIn both examples, the output has:\n\n- 3s surrounding the regions where 6s were in the input.\n- 4s inside the original 6 regions.\n- The original 6s are replaced with 4s except for the borders which are replaced with 3s? Or perhaps the 6s are kept as 6 in their perimeter and turned into 4s inside.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output row 4: the input has a 6,6 in positions 3 and 4, which in output becomes 6,6. So those 6s are retained. But in the same row, the 6 at position 8 in input becomes a 6 in output, but the 8s next to it (positions 9,10) become 4s. Wait, but those 8s were adjacent to the 6s. So if the 8s adjacent to 6s become 3s, but here they're 4s. That contradicts. Maybe there's a step-by-step process.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the transformation is that each 6 in the input is replaced by 4, then a border of 3 is added around the original 6 regions, and the original 8s adjacent to the 6 regions become 3s. But in the output, there are 6s remaining. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, let's take a specific example. In Example 0's input, there's a 6 in the middle. The output shows that those 6s are now surrounded by 3s, but some of the original 6s are replaced with 4s. Maybe the 6s that are in the interior (surrounded by other 6s) become 4s, and the perimeter 6s remain as 6s. Then, the 8s adjacent to the 6s (both original and new) become 3s.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's input row 4: [8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8]. The 6s here are in positions 3,4,8,11. \n\nIn the output row 4: [8,8,3,6,6,3,8,3,6,4,4,6,3,8,8]. So the 6s at 3 and 4 (original 6s) remain 6. The 6 at 8 remains 6, but the 8s adjacent to it (positions 9,10) become 4s. Wait, but according to the hypothesis, the 6s that are on the perimeter (adjacent to 8s) remain 6, and the 6s in the interior become 4. But in this case, the 6 at position 8 is adjacent to 8s (positions 9,10 are 8s in input), so it's a perimeter 6 and remains 6. But then why do positions 9 and 10 become 4s in the output? That doesn't fit. Because those were 8s in the input, but in the output, they're 4s. So maybe there's a different process.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the process is:\n\n1. For each 6 in the input, check if it's on the edge of the 6 region (adjacent to an 8). If yes, leave it as 6. If it's surrounded by 6s (not adjacent to any 8), replace it with 4.\n\n2. Then, replace all 8s that are adjacent to any 6 (original or 4) with 3.\n\nSo, for Example 0's input row 3: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8]. The two 6s are each adjacent to 8s (so edge 6s), so they remain 6. The 8s next to them (positions 9 and 10) become 3s? But in the output, positions 9 and 10 are 4 and 4. Hmm, this doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are replaced by 4s, and then surrounded by 3s. But in that case, the output would have 3s around 4s. But in the examples, there are 6s in the output.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Let's look for another angle. The numbers 3, 4, 6, 8\u2014maybe they correspond to layers. For example, 8 is the outermost layer, 3 is the next, then 6, then 4. Or perhaps the layers are built in a certain way.\n\nWait, in the output of Example 0, the 3s form a border around the 6/4 regions. The 6s form another layer inside the 3s, and 4s are the innermost. So perhaps each original 6 in the input is replaced by 4, and layers of 6 and 3 are added around them. But that might not explain all cases.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is a cellular automaton-like step where each cell's new value depends on its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 8 and has a 6 neighbor, it becomes 3. If a cell is 6 and has any 8 neighbor, it stays 6; otherwise, it becomes 4. Let's test this.\n\nTake a 6 in the input. If it's on the edge (adjacent to 8), it remains 6. If it's surrounded by 6s (no 8 neighbors), it becomes 4. Then, any 8 adjacent to a 6 (original or new) becomes 3. Let's apply this to Example 0's input row 3.\n\nOriginal row 3 (input): ...6,8,8,6... \n\nThe two 6s are adjacent to 8s, so they remain 6. The 8s between them are adjacent to 6s (original 6s), so they become 3s. Wait, but in the output, those positions are 4s. So this doesn't align. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s adjacent to 6s become 3s, and the 6s adjacent to 3s become 6, and the inner 6s become 4. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's row 3 input, after step 1: 8s adjacent to 6s become 3. Then, the 6s adjacent to 3s remain 6, and any 6s not adjacent to 3s (but adjacent to other 6s) become 4. But in the input row 3, the 6s are isolated (each is only adjacent to 8s except for themselves). Wait, but in the input row 3, the two 6s are separated by 8s. So after replacing adjacent 8s with 3s, those 6s are next to 3s. So they stay 6. The 8s between them become 3s. But in the output, those positions are 4 and 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting quite complicated. Maybe I should look for another pattern. For instance, looking at the test input and trying to see how the pattern would apply.\n\nThe test input has several 6 regions. For example, in row 2 (third row from the top), there's a sequence of three 6s. In the output, maybe those would be surrounded by 3s, and the innermost 6s become 4s. Let's take that as a hypothesis and see if it aligns with the examples.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 6 regions in the input are replaced by a structure where their perimeter is 6, then surrounded by 3s, and the interior 6s become 4s. For example, in the input's row 4, there are two adjacent 6s. In the output, they remain 6, surrounded by 3s. The 6s in the middle (like the ones that form a cross) would have their inner parts turned into 4s.\n\nSo the process could be:\n\n1. For each 6 in the input, determine if it's part of the perimeter (adjacent to an 8) or the interior.\n\n2. Perimeter 6s stay 6, interior 6s become 4.\n\n3. Replace all 8s adjacent to any original 6 (perimeter or interior) with 3.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's input row 3, the 6s are isolated (each surrounded by 8s). So those 6s are perimeters and remain 6. The 8s around them become 3s. But in the output row 3, the structure is 3,6,4,4,6,3. How does that happen?\n\nAh, perhaps when two 6s are separated by 8s in the input, after replacing the 8s with 3s, those 3s become adjacent to the 6s, but then the original 6s are still perimeters, so they stay 6. But how do the 4s appear?\n\nMaybe there's another layer. For example, after the first transformation (replacing 8s adjacent to 6s with 3s), the next step is to look at the original 6s. Those that are adjacent to 3s (the new border) stay 6, and any 6s that are now adjacent to other 6s and not 3s become 4.\n\nWait, let's take the input row 3 of Example 0 again. Original input has 6s at positions 8 and 11 (assuming 0-based). The 8s between them (positions 9 and 10) become 3s. So after step 1, the row becomes ...6,3,3,6... Now, the two 6s are adjacent to 3s. These 6s are perimeter, so they stay 6. But where do the 4s come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s in the input that are part of larger regions (not isolated) have their interiors converted to 4s. For example, if a 6 is part of a block that's at least 3x3, the center becomes 4. But that seems too specific.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nIn the input's row 8 (0-based?), there's a line of six 6s. In the output, those become 6,6,6,6,6,6,3. Wait, no. The output row 8 is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3]. So the original 6s are replaced with 6s and surrounded by 3s. Then, in row 9 of the input, there's a 6 followed by 8s. In the output, that becomes 3,6,4,4,4,4,6,3. So the 6 is now surrounded by 4s and 3s.\n\nThis suggests that the 6s are surrounded by 3s (from the 8s) and their interiors (the 6s) are replaced with 4s if they are not on the perimeter.\n\nPutting this all together, the pattern seems to be:\n\n- For each cell in the input:\n   - If it's a 6 and it's on the edge of a 6 region (adjacent to an 8), it remains 6.\n   - If it's a 6 and is in the interior (surrounded by 6s), it becomes 4.\n   - All 8s that are adjacent to any 6 (original or transformed) become 3s.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Identify all 6 regions in the input.\n\n2. For each 6 cell, check if it's on the edge (adjacent to an 8). If yes, keep it as 6. Otherwise, change it to 4.\n\n3. Then, for all 8 cells that are adjacent to any 6 or 4 cell, change them to 3.\n\nThis would explain the examples. Let's verify with Example 0's row 3:\n\nOriginal input row 3 (6s at positions 8 and 11, separated by 8s). These 6s are on the edge (adjacent to 8s), so they remain 6. The 8s adjacent to them become 3s. However, in the output row 3, between the two 6s are 4s. Wait, that contradicts this hypothesis. Because according to this rule, the 8s between them would become 3s, not 4s.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's an error in this line of thinking. Let's look again. In Example 0's output row 3, the two original 6s are at positions 8 and 11. The output shows between them 4s. So the positions between them (9,10) are 4s. But according to the previous steps, those positions were 8s in the input and should become 3s if adjacent to 6s. So how do they become 4s?\n\nThis suggests that my previous hypothesis is incorrect. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nAnother observation: in the output, whenever there's a 6 in the input, it's either replaced by 6 or 4. The 4s seem to be in the inner parts of the 6 shapes. The 3s form a border around the 6/4 areas. So perhaps the process is:\n\n- Create a border around each 6 region by converting adjacent 8s to 3s.\n- Convert the inner parts of the 6 regions to 4s.\n\nBut how to determine the inner parts. For example, if the 6 region is a hollow square, then the inner 8s would become 3s. But in Example 0's output, there are 4s inside.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could involve two passes:\n\n1. First pass: Convert all 8s adjacent to 6s into 3s.\n\n2. Second pass: Convert all 6s that are now adjacent to 3s into 4s. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 6s are replaced by 4s, and the 8s adjacent to 6s become 3s, and the 8s adjacent to 3s become something else. But that's not supported by the examples.\n\nWait, let's take a cell in the output and track its value based on input.\n\nIn Example 0's output row 3, cell 9 is 4. In the input, that cell was 8. So 8 becomes 4. That doesn't fit the previous ideas. How does that happen?\n\nMaybe there's a different rule: cells that are surrounded by 6s in the input become 4s, and cells adjacent to 6s become 3s. But if a cell is adjacent to both 6s and 8s, it becomes 3. But how does that explain 8s becoming 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of adjacent 6s. For example, 8s that are adjacent to two or more 6s become 4, and those adjacent to one become 3. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input row 3, the cells between the two 6s (positions 9 and 10) are 8s. In the output, they're 4s. How do 8s become 4s? That's puzzling. Unless there's a step where certain 8s are turned into 4s. Maybe 8s that are completely surrounded by 6s become 4s. But in this case, those 8s are between two 6s but not surrounded on all sides. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a border around the 6s with 3s and then fill the interior with 4s. But how to determine the interior. For example, in a square of 6s, the interior would be the 6s not on the perimeter. But if the input's 6s form a cross, perhaps the inner parts become 4s.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could involve expanding the 6 regions by one cell, converting those to 3s, and then converting the original 6s to 4s. But in the examples, some 6s remain 6.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for another pattern. In Example 0's output, the 3s form a sort of outline around the areas where 6s were in the input, and the 6s are now in a smaller area inside the 3s. The 4s are inside the 6s. So perhaps the process is:\n\n1. Expand the 6 regions by one layer outward (into 8s), turning those into 3s.\n\n2. Then, shrink the original 6 regions by one layer inward, turning those into 4s.\n\nBut how to do that? Like, for each 6 in the input, any adjacent 8 becomes 3. Then, for each 6 that is not on the perimeter (i.e., all neighbors are 6), it becomes 4. This might work.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's input row 3: 6,8,8,6. Expanding outward would turn the adjacent 8s into 3s. Then, the original 6s are on the perimeter (adjacent to 3s now), so they stay 6. The inner parts of the 6 regions (if any) would become 4. But in this case, the two 6s are isolated, so there's no interior. But in the output, the 8s between them are 4s, which contradicts this idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after expanding 6s into 3s, the original 6s are replaced with 4s. So:\n\n1. All 8s adjacent to 6s become 3s.\n\n2. All original 6s become 4s.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, there are 6s remaining, so this can't be.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to look for a different angle. Perhaps the numbers 3,4,6 are part of a color palette shift, representing layers. For example, the outermost layer is 3, then 6, then 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers could represent different types of borders. Maybe 8 is the background, 3 is a middle layer, 6 is the next, and 4 is the core.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nIn the center, there's a cross-like structure. The outermost layer is 3, then 6, then 4. For instance, in row 4 of the output: 3,6,6,3,... then 3,6,4,4,6,3. So the layers go 3 ->6->4. Each layer is nested. So perhaps the transformation is to add two layers around the original 6s: first a 3 layer, then a 6 layer, and the original 6s become 4. But that seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, the output replaces every occurrence of a 6 in the input with a 4 and then adds layers of 6 and 3 around it. But how would that work with varying shapes?\n\nAnother idea: the output is a dilation of the 6 regions with 3s and then an erosion for the 4s. But I'm not familiar enough with image processing techniques to apply that here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to draw a border of 3s around each 6 region and then fill the interior with 4s. For example:\n\n- For each 6 in the input, if it's adjacent to an 8, leave it as 6. Otherwise, change it to 4.\n\n- Then, change all 8s adjacent to 6s to 3.\n\nBut in Example 0's input row 3, the two 6s are adjacent to 8s, so they stay 6. The 8s adjacent to them become 3. But in the output, between them are 4s, which were originally 8s. So this doesn't explain it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the process is multi-step:\n\n1. For each 8 that is adjacent to a 6, change it to 3.\n\n2. For each 6 that is now adjacent to a 3, change it to 6.\n\n3. For each 6 that is not adjacent to any 3, change it to 4.\n\nBut again, testing this with Example 0's row 3:\n\nOriginal input: 6,8,8,6.\n\nStep 1: 8s adjacent to 6s become 3. So becomes 6,3,3,6.\n\nStep 2: 6s adjacent to 3s stay 6.\n\nStep 3: 6s not adjacent to 3s (but in this case, they are adjacent to 3s) remain 6.\n\nSo output would be 6,3,3,6. But the actual output has 3,6,4,4,6,3. Which doesn't match.\n\nI'm clearly missing something here. Let's try to think of the overall structure. The outputs for the examples seem to have a 3-layer surrounding the original 6 regions, and within those regions, the original 6s are replaced by 4s. But how?\n\nAnother observation: in the output, whenever there's a 6 in the input that is part of a line or block, it's replaced with 4 if it's in the middle, and remains 6 if it's on the edge. The 8s around them become 3s. For example, in Example 0's input row 4, the two 6s (positions 3 and 4) are part of a larger block. In the output, they remain 6, and the 8s around become 3s. The 6s deeper inside (like in row 3 of the output) become 4.\n\nWait, perhaps it's like this:\n\n- Each 6 in the input is replaced by 4 if it's not on the edge of the 6 region (i.e., has 6s on all four sides).\n\n- Then, all 8s adjacent to any 6 (original or new 4) become 3s.\n\nBut in Example 0's input row 3, the 6s are isolated and not part of a larger block. So they are edges and remain 6. The 8s around them become 3s. But in the output, between them are 4s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is:\n\n- Convert all 6s to 4s.\n\n- Then, for each 4 that is adjacent to an 8, create a 3 around it.\n\n- Then, for each 3 that is adjacent to an 8, create another 3 around it. But this seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to take the original 6s and create a border of 3s around them, then replace the original 6s with 4s. But then, the 6s in the output would be 4s, but in the examples, there are 6s remaining. So this can't be.\n\nAnother approach: compare the positions of 6s in the input and output. For Example 0's input and output:\n\nLooking at the input's third row: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8]\n\nOutput row 3: [8,8,3,3,3,3,8,3,6,4,4,6,3,8,8]\n\nSo the original 6s are at positions 8 and 11. In the output, they're still 6. The 8s between them (9 and 10) are now 4s, and surrounding areas are 3s.\n\nSo perhaps the 8s that are enclosed by 6s (or between them) become 4s. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the 8s that are enclosed by 6s on two or more sides are converted to 4s. For example, if an 8 is between two 6s horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, it becomes 4. Then, the 8s adjacent to 6s become 3s. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input row 3, the 8s at positions 9 and 10 are between two 6s horizontally. So they become 4s. The 8s around them (positions 7, 12, etc.) become 3s because they are adjacent to 6s.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the rule could be:\n\n1. For each 8 in the input:\n   - If it's adjacent to two or more 6s in opposite directions (e.g., left and right, up and down), it becomes 4.\n   - Otherwise, if it's adjacent to any 6, it becomes 3.\n\n2. For each 6 in the input, if it's adjacent to any 8, it remains 6. Otherwise, it becomes 4.\n\nWait, let's test this. In Example 0's input row 3, the 8s at positions 9 and 10 are between two 6s (left and right), so they become 4. The 8s adjacent to the 6s (positions 7, 8's neighbors, etc.) become 3. The original 6s are adjacent to 8s (now 3s and 4s), so they remain 6.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 4, the 6s at positions 3 and 4 are adjacent to 8s (so they remain 6). The 8s around them become 3. The 6s at positions 8 and 11 are adjacent to 8s (so remain 6). The 8s between them (positions 9 and 10) are between two 6s and become 4.\n\nThis seems to fit. Let's check another part. In Example 0's input row 2: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8]. The 6s are a block of four. The 8s around them become 3. The 8s in the middle of the 6 block? No, the 6s are consecutive, so there are no 8s between them. So in the output row 2: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,6,6,3,8,8]. The 6s remain 6 because they are adjacent to 8s (now 3s). The 8s adjacent to the 6s become 3s. So this fits.\n\nIn Example 0's output row 4: [8,8,3,6,6,3,8,3,6,4,4,6,3,8,8]. The 6s at positions 3 and 4 are adjacent to 3s (from converted 8s), so they remain 6. The 8s between them and other 6s become 3s or 4s.\n\nSo the rule seems to be:\n\n- For any 8 in the input:\n   - If it is between two 6s in opposite directions (left-right, up-down), it becomes 4.\n   - Otherwise, if it is adjacent to any 6, it becomes 3.\n- For any 6 in the input:\n   - If it is adjacent to any 8 (now converted to 3 or 4), it remains 6.\n   - Otherwise, it becomes 4.\n\nThis explains the examples. Now, applying this to the test input.\n\nLet's take the test input and apply this rule.\n\nTest input row 3 (third from top): [8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8].\n\nThe 6s form a block of four. The 8s adjacent to them should become 3s. The 8s between the 6s are not present here, so no 4s. But let's see:\n\nWait, row 3 of the test input is [8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8]. The 6s are in positions 2-5 and 9-11. The 8s between the two groups of 6s (positions 6-8) are 8,8,8. Are any of these 8s between two 6s in opposite directions?\n\nIn this case, the left group is at positions 2-5 (columns 2-5), and the right group is at 9-11. The 8s in between (columns 6-8) are not between any 6s in opposite directions. So they would become 3s if adjacent to any 6. For example, positions 6 and 8 are adjacent to 6s (position 5 is 6 in the left group, and position 9 is 6 in the right group). So positions 6 and 8 are adjacent to 6s and become 3. Position 7 is between two 8s (or adjacent to 8s and not 6s), so it remains 8.\n\nWait, no. Position 6 is adjacent to position 5 (which is 6), so becomes 3. Position 8 is adjacent to position 9 (6), so becomes 3. Position 7 is not adjacent to any 6, so remains 8. So row 3 of the test output would be:\n\nOriginal: [8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8]\n\nAfter transformation: 8,8 becomes 8,8. Then, the 6s are replaced as follows. Each 6 is adjacent to 8s or other 6s. The 6s on the edges of the block are adjacent to 8s (which will become 3s), so they remain 6. The inner 6s (if any) would be surrounded by 6s and become 4. But in this case, the 6s are in a line. For example, in the left group (positions 2-5), each 6 is adjacent to at least one 8 (except possibly the inner ones). Wait, position 2 is adjacent to 8 on the left, position 3 is adjacent to 8 on the left (position 2 is 6), etc. Hmm, maybe I need to recheck.\n\nEach 6 in the left group (columns 2-5):\n\n- Column 2: adjacent to 8 on column 1, so remains 6.\n\n- Column 3: adjacent to column 2 (6) and column 4 (6). If there are no 8s adjacent, then this 6 becomes 4. But wait, in the input, these 6s are part of a block. So the 6s in the middle might not be adjacent to any 8s.\n\nWait, the input row 3 is [8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8]. The 6s are from index 2 to 5. So:\n\n- Position 2: adjacent to 8 (left) and 6 (right).\n\n- Position 3: adjacent to 6 (left) and 6 (right).\n\n- Position 4: adjacent to 6 (left) and 6 (right).\n\n- Position 5: adjacent to 6 (left) and 8 (right).\n\nSo positions 3 and 4 are surrounded by 6s and not adjacent to any 8s. Therefore, these would become 4s. Positions 2 and 5 remain 6s.\n\nSimilarly, the right group (positions 9-11):\n\n- Position 9: adjacent to 8 (position 8) and 6 (position 10).\n\n- Position 10: adjacent to 6 (left and right).\n\n- Position 11: adjacent to 6 (left) and 8 (right).\n\nSo positions 9 and 11 remain 6s, position 10 becomes 4.\n\nSo the transformed row 3 would have:\n\n8,8,6,4,4,6,3,8,3,6,4,6,3,8,8.\n\nThen, the 8s adjacent to 6s become 3s. For example:\n\n- Position 6 (original 8) is adjacent to position 5 (6), becomes 3.\n\n- Position 8 (original 8) is adjacent to position 9 (6), becomes 3.\n\n- Position 12 (original 8) is adjacent to position 11 (6), becomes 3.\n\nSo the row becomes:\n\n[8,8,6,4,4,6,3,8,3,6,4,6,3,8,8]\n\nWait, but according to the rule, any 8 adjacent to a 6 becomes 3. So positions 6, 8, 12 become 3. The 8s in positions 7 and 13-14 remain 8.\n\nBut also, in this row, the original 8s at positions 7 and 8: position 7 is adjacent to position 6 (now 3) and position 8 (original 8, which is adjacent to position 9 (6) \u2192 becomes 3. So position 7's original 8 becomes 3? No. Because the rule is for the original 8s. So during the transformation, the 8s are checked for adjacency to original 6s. Because the transformation is done in one pass, not iteratively. Or is it based on the original input?\n\nThis is a crucial point. If the transformation is based on the original input's 6s, then the 8s adjacent to any original 6 are turned into 3s, regardless of other changes. Then, the 6s are replaced with 4s if they are not adjacent to any original 8s.\n\nAlternatively, if the transformation processes the 6s and 8s in separate steps, first converting 6s to 4s where appropriate, then converting 8s to 3s based on original 6s.\n\nThis is getting too complicated without a clear pattern. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a best guess based on the examples.\n\nIn the test input, there's a part in row 11:\n\n[8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8]\n\nThis is a horizontal line of seven 6s. According to the pattern observed, the outermost 6s (first and last in the line) would remain 6, and the inner ones become 4. The 8s adjacent to them would become 3s. So the transformed row would be:\n\n8,8,8,8,3,6,4,4,4,4,6,3,8,8,8.\n\nThen, the 8s adjacent to the 6s become 3s. But in the original input, the 6s are surrounded by 8s, so those 8s become 3s. The inner 6s (positions 5-9) become 4s.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nPutting this all together, the final answer should follow the pattern where:\n\n- Original 6s that are on the edge (adjacent to 8s) remain 6.\n\n- Original 6s that are surrounded by other 6s become 4.\n\n- All 8s adjacent to original 6s become 3.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the output should have 3s surrounding the 6 regions, 4s inside the 6 regions, and remaining 6s on the edges.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input row 2 (third row):\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8]\n\nOriginal 6s are positions 9-11. They are adjacent to 8s on both ends. So the middle 6 (position 10) is surrounded by 6s? No, position 9 is 6, 10 is 6, 11 is 6. They are all adjacent to 8s on their left (position 8) and right (position 12). So all three 6s are edge 6s (since they have adjacent 8s). So they remain 6. The 8s adjacent to them become 3s. So the transformed row would be:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,3,8,8.\n\nWait, but according to the pattern, any 8 adjacent to a 6 becomes 3. So positions 7 and 8 (adjacent to position 9's 6) become 3. Position 12 (adjacent to position 11's 6) becomes 3. So the row becomes:\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,3,8,8]\n\nBut in the training examples, there are cases where 8s between 6s become 4s. Like in Example 0's row 3. But according to this test, those would only become 4s if the 8s are between 6s in the input. However, in the test input row 3, there are two groups of 6s, so perhaps the 8s between them are not between two 6s in the same row but in different columns.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming, but based on the pattern observed, the answer should follow the examples where 3s form a border around 6 regions, 6s are on the edges, and 4s are inside. Applying this to the test input, the output should look like the examples provided.",
