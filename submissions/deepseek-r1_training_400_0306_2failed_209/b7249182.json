        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I have these training examples where the input is a grid of numbers and the output is another grid. My job is to find out what transformation is happening from input to output, then apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input has a 2 in the fifth position of the second row and an 8 in the fifth position of the eleventh row. The output shows those numbers expanding into some sort of shapes. For the 2, there's a vertical line down from the original position, then a horizontal line in row 4 (but shifted?), and a sort of diamond or cross shape. Similarly, the 8 has a horizontal line in row 7 and vertical lines above and below. Maybe each number creates a certain pattern around it.\n\nIn Example 1, there's a 3 in the second column of row 6 and a 1 in the last column of the same row. The output has those numbers expanding into crosses. The 3 creates a horizontal line to the left and vertical lines going up and down, forming a cross. The 1 does the same to the right. The middle of the cross has a line of the same number, and the intersections are filled. The numbers 3 and 1 in the input are in row 6, columns 1 and 12. The output for 3 has a horizontal line spanning columns 1-5 (since in row 6, columns 1-5 are 3s), but maybe there's a cross where vertical and horizontal lines meet. Similarly for the 1, it's a horizontal line to the right and vertical lines.\n\nIn Example 2, there's a 5 in column 3 of row 5 and an 8 in column 17 of the same row. The output shows a diamond-like shape for both. The 5's pattern is a cross with horizontal and vertical lines, and maybe diagonal lines? Wait, looking at row 5 in the output, there's a horizontal line of 5s from column 3 to 8. Then in rows 3 and 7, there are horizontal lines for 5 and 8. Also, the 8s form a similar structure but on their side. Maybe each number creates a cross or diamond shape, with the size depending on the number's value? Wait, 2, 3, 5, 8... maybe the number's value determines the size of the cross?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 2 and 8. The 2's cross is smaller than the 8's. Let me check the output for Example 0:\n\nThe 2 in row 1 (0-indexed?) Wait, the input for Example 0 is a list of rows. Let's count rows. The input for example 0 has 14 rows. The 2 is in the second row (index 1 if starting from 0), fifth element (index 4). The output for that 2 has a vertical line below it (rows 1,2,3) and then in row 4 (index 4?), there's a horizontal line. Wait, the output for row 4 (0-based index 4) is [0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0]. So that's a horizontal line of 2s. Then rows 5 and 6 have vertical elements. Hmm, maybe the shape is a cross where the horizontal line is as long as the number's value, and the vertical line is the same? Or maybe the number determines the radius of the cross.\n\nAlternatively, the number could be the length of the arms of a cross. For example, 2 would have arms of length 2 in each direction. But in Example 0, the 2's output has a horizontal line of 5 elements (2,2,2,2,2), which is length 5. That's odd. Wait, maybe not. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's output for the 2:\n\nLooking at row 4 (index 4), the horizontal line is from column 2 to 6 (indices 2-6), which is 5 elements. So that's a length of 5. The vertical line for the 2 starts at row 1 (original position), then goes down to row 3 (so three rows), and then in row 4, it's part of the horizontal line. The horizontal line spans 5 elements, which is 2*2 + 1? Because 2 would give a radius of 2, making the length 2*2+1=5. Similarly, the 8 in example 0's output has a horizontal line in row 7 (index 7) which is 8's horizontal line. Let's count: the row for the 8 in the output (row 10 in input, but in output, the 8 is in row 10, and the horizontal line is in row 7 (output row 7) as [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0], which is 5 elements again. Wait, that's 5 elements as well. But 8 is a larger number. Hmm, maybe the length isn't directly the number. Or perhaps the pattern isn't based on the number's value but the position relative to other numbers.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is a cross that's centered at the original number's position. The cross has horizontal and vertical lines. For example, in Example 0's 2, the original position is row 1, column 4. The cross in the output includes rows 1,2,3 (vertical) and columns 2-6 in row 4 (horizontal). So the vertical part is three rows (original row, one above, one below?), but in this case, the original is row 1. Wait, the vertical part in Example 0's 2 is rows 1,2,3 (the original row, then two rows below). The horizontal part is in row 4, columns 2-6. So the horizontal line is two rows below the original position. That doesn't form a cross. Wait, perhaps the cross is centered at the original position. For the 2, maybe it's a cross with a horizontal and vertical line through it. But in Example 0's output, the 2's vertical line is rows 1-3, and the horizontal line is in row 4. That's not centered. Hmm, maybe the cross is shifted. This is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a 3 in row 6, column 1 (assuming rows start at 0) and a 1 in row 6, column 12. The output for 3 has a horizontal line spanning columns 1-5 (so 5 elements) and vertical lines. The horizontal line is in row 6, columns 1-5 (values 3), and vertical lines going up and down. For the vertical lines, the 3's vertical lines are rows 4-8 (assuming row 6 is the center). Wait, in the output, row 6 (input's row 6) has 3s from column 1-5, and then rows 4 and 8 have horizontal lines for the 3 and 1. Hmm, maybe each number creates a cross where the horizontal arm is length based on the number, and the vertical is similar.\n\nAlternatively, the cross has arms whose length is the number. For example, 3 would have horizontal and vertical arms extending 3 units from the center. So for the 3 in column 1, row 6, the horizontal arm would go from column 1- (1-3) but that would be negative. Wait, maybe it's in both directions. So a 3 would extend 3 units left and right, and 3 units up and down. But in Example 1's output for 3, the horizontal line in row 6 is columns 1-5. Starting at column 1 (original position), extending 4 to the right (columns 1,2,3,4,5: 5 elements). But 3 would imply 3 units each way. So 1 (original) +3 to the left and right would be from -2 to 4, but since columns can't be negative, maybe it's adjusted. Hmm, this doesn't quite add up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number is the radius of the cross. For example, a number n creates a cross that extends n units in each direction. So for 3, the cross would be 3 units left, right, up, down. But in Example 1, the horizontal line for 3 is columns 1-5 (5 elements), which would be 2 units left and 3 units right. But that's 3 on each side would give 7 elements (from 1-3 left and right), but that's not matching. Wait, maybe the cross is formed by the number of the value. Like, the horizontal line's length is the number. So for 3, a horizontal line of 3 units. But in Example 0's 2, the horizontal line is 5 units. 2*2+1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2: the input has a 5 and 8. The output shows horizontal lines for 5 and 8. The 5's horizontal line is in row 5, columns 3-8 (6 elements), which is 5 in the input. The 8's horizontal line is columns 11-16 (6 elements). Wait, 5 and 8 would have horizontal lines of 5 and 8 units? No, 6 elements. So perhaps 5+1? Not sure. The vertical lines for 5 are in rows 3-7 (5 rows?), but that's 5 elements. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the numbers in the input create a diamond shape in the output. For instance, the number's value determines the size of the diamond. For example, a 2 would make a diamond with radius 2. But how does that translate to the grid?\n\nAlternatively, each number is a seed that grows into a cross shape where the horizontal and vertical lines are of length equal to the number. But again, how does that fit with the examples?\n\nWait, in Example 0's output for the 2, the horizontal line is in row 4, and the vertical lines are in rows 1,2,3. The original 2 is in row 1. The horizontal line is three rows below. So maybe the horizontal line is placed a certain number of rows below, based on the value. Like, the value determines the distance between the original position and the horizontal line. For example, 2: the horizontal line is 3 rows below (since 2+1=3?), but then 8's horizontal line is in row 7 (original in row 10?), which is 3 rows above. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number represents the distance from the original position to the horizontal and vertical lines. For example, 2 in row 1, column 4. The horizontal line is in row 4, which is 3 rows below (row 1 to 4: difference of 3). The vertical lines in rows 1,2,3. So perhaps the number indicates how many steps down and up to spread.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers in the input are the centers of a cross that's made up of their value. For example, each non-zero number in the input generates a cross in the output. The cross has a horizontal line and a vertical line intersecting at the original position, and the lines are filled with the number's value. But in Example 0, the original 2 is in row 1, column 4, but the cross seems to be in rows 1,2,3 (vertical) and row 4, columns 2-6 (horizontal). That doesn't cross at the original position. So maybe not a simple cross.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that each number creates a horizontal line of that number, extending to the left and right, and a vertical line above and below. The length of these lines is determined by the number's value. For example, a 2 would have a horizontal line of 2 units to the left and right, and vertical lines 2 units up and down. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nLooking at Example 0's 2: original position at row 1, column 4. If 2 has a horizontal line extending 2 left and right, columns 4-2 to 4+2 (columns 2-6), which is 5 elements. That matches the horizontal line in row 4 (columns 2-6). Then the vertical line would extend 2 rows up and down from the original row. But the original row is row 1. So rows -1 to 3 (but row -1 doesn't exist). So maybe it can only go down. In the output, the vertical lines for the 2 are in rows 1,2,3 (so 3 rows), which is 2 down. So maybe the vertical line is 2 rows down. The horizontal line is 2 left and right.\n\nBut then in Example 0's 8, which is in row 10, column 4. The horizontal line in row 7 (columns 2-6, 5 elements). Wait, 8 would have to be a horizontal line of 8 units. But 8 left and right would be 17 elements, which is impossible. So that's not matching. So maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternative approach: Looking at the outputs, maybe the numbers in the input are being transformed into some kind of arrows pointing in certain directions. For example, in Example 0, the 2 and 8 create a sort of T-shape or inverted T. The 2 has a vertical line below and a horizontal line further down, and the 8 has a horizontal line above and vertical lines above and below. Or maybe they form a diamond.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number creates a diamond shape where the number is at the center, and the size of the diamond increases with the number. For example, 2 could form a diamond of size 2, but I'm not sure how that would look.\n\nAnother thought: the outputs seem to have the original number, and then lines in specific directions. For example, in Example 0's 2, the vertical line below and a horizontal line further down, forming a sort of hook. The 8 in Example 0's output has a horizontal line in row 7 and vertical lines above and below. Maybe the number determines the direction of the lines. Like even numbers go down, odd numbers up, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers could represent the ASCII values of characters that form a shape. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, looking at the test input. The test input has a 7 in row 1, column 3 (0-based) and a 6 in row 16, column 3. Following the pattern from the examples, each of these numbers would generate a certain structure.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 and 8 are in separate rows and their structures are separate. In Example 2, the 5 and 8 are in the same row and their structures are adjacent. So perhaps each number is processed independently, and their generated shapes are combined in the output.\n\nSo the task is to, for each number in the input, generate a specific shape in the output, and then sum or overlay all those shapes (with 0 being empty).\n\nSo, the key is to figure out what shape each number creates.\n\nLooking at Example 0's 2:\n\nOriginal position: row 1, column 4 (assuming rows start at 0). The output for this 2 includes:\n\n- The original position (row 1, column 4) is 2.\n- Rows 2 and 3, column 4: 2.\n- Row 4: columns 2-6 are 2.\n- Rows 5 and 6: columns 2 and 6 are 2 (for row 5) and columns 2 and 6 for row 6 have 2 and 8, but wait, row 6 has 8s. Wait, maybe the 2 and 8's shapes overlap?\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the 8 is in row 10, column 4. Its shape includes:\n\n- Row 10, column 4: 8.\n- Rows 7-9, column 4: 8?\nWait, in row 7, column 4: looking at the output for Example 0's row 7 (0-based?), which is [0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0]. Wait, that's a horizontal line in row 7, columns 2-6. Then rows 8-10 have 8 in column 4. Hmm.\n\nSo for the 8 in row 10, column 4:\n\n- The horizontal line is in row 7 (3 rows above), columns 2-6 (same as the 2's horizontal line in row 4).\n- Then vertical lines from row 7 to 10 (row 7,8,9,10) in column 4.\n\nWait, but the original 8 is in row 10, column 4. The horizontal line is in row 7, which is three rows above. Then from row 7 down to row 10, the vertical line. So that's a horizontal line three rows above the original, spanning 5 columns, and then a vertical line from the horizontal line down to the original position.\n\nSimilarly, the 2's horizontal line is in row 4, three rows below the original position (row 1). Then a vertical line from row 1 down to row 4.\n\nAh! So maybe the pattern is: for each number N in the input, you create a horizontal line that is N rows away from the original position (either above or below?), and then a vertical line connecting that horizontal line back to the original position. The horizontal line's length might be fixed or based on the number.\n\nWait, in Example 0:\n\nFor the 2 in row 1, the horizontal line is in row 4 (3 rows below: 1+3=4). Then the vertical line from row 1 to 4 (columns 4). And the horizontal line is columns 2-6, which is 5 elements. So maybe 2's value is 2, and the horizontal line is 2*2 +1 =5 elements. Then the horizontal line is placed 2+1=3 rows away.\n\nFor the 8 in row 10, the horizontal line is in row 7 (10-3=7). Then vertical line from row 7 to 10. The horizontal line again is 5 elements. So 8's horizontal line is placed 3 rows above (10-3=7). And the horizontal line is 5 elements.\n\nSo maybe the number N determines the distance from the original row to the horizontal line as (N mod some number) +1, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps all horizontal lines are placed 3 rows away from the original, but the number's parity determines direction. But 2 is even and goes down, 8 is even and goes up. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for numbers less than 5, the horizontal line is placed below, and for higher numbers above. But 2 is placed below (row 4 from row 1), 8 is placed above (row 7 from row 10). So 8 is higher than 5, so placed above. But 5 in Example 2 is in row 5 (input), and the horizontal line is in row 5, columns 3-8 (but I'm not sure).\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the 5 is in row 5 (0-based?), column 3. The output's horizontal line for 5 is in row 5, columns 3-8 (length 6). Then vertical lines in columns 8 and 11 (maybe?) for 5 and 8. Wait, perhaps the horizontal line is placed in the same row as the original, but spans left and right based on the number. But then the vertical line would be above and below. But that doesn't fit previous examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the horizontal line is N rows away from the original, where N is the number divided by 2, rounded down. For example, 2 would be 1 row away (2/2=1), so horizontal line at row 1 +1=2. But in Example 0, it's at row 4. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is always three rows away. For 2, it's three rows below (row 1+3=4). For 8, three rows above (row 10-3=7). For 3, three rows above or below? In Example 1, the 3 is in row 6. Its horizontal line is in row 6 itself (output row 6, columns 1-5). So that's not three rows away. So this idea is not correct.\n\nAnother angle: the horizontal line's length is always 5 elements, regardless of the number. For example, in Example 0, both 2 and 8 have horizontal lines of 5 elements. Example 1's 3 has a horizontal line of 5 elements. Example 2's 5 and 8 have horizontal lines of 6 and 6 elements. Wait, no. In Example 2, the 5's horizontal line is columns 3-8, which is 6 elements. The 8's is columns 11-16 (6 elements). So maybe even numbers have longer lines? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the horizontal line's length is the number plus 1. 2+3=5? Not sure. Wait 2's line is 5 elements. 3's line is 5 elements (columns 1-5). 5's line is 6 elements (3-8). 8's line is 6 elements (11-16). So 5 and 8 have length 6. Hmm, but 5 and 8 are larger numbers. Maybe the length is the number divided by 2, rounded up. For 2, 2/2=1, so 1*2 +1=3? No. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the horizontal line's length is determined by the number's position in the alphabet. Like, 2 is B, 3 is C, etc. But that's a stretch.\n\nLet's look at the vertical lines. In Example 0's 2, the vertical line is from row 1 to row 4 (original row to the horizontal line row). For 8, the vertical line is from row 7 to 10. So the vertical line connects the original position to the horizontal line.\n\nSo the pattern for each number is:\n\n- The original number is at (R, C).\n- A horizontal line is drawn at a certain row H, which is R \u00b1 K, where K depends on the number.\n- The horizontal line spans from C - L to C + L, where L is determined by the number.\n- A vertical line is drawn from (R, C) to (H, C), filling all cells in between.\n\nBut how to determine H and L.\n\nIn Example 0's 2:\n\nOriginal R=1, C=4.\n\nHorizontal line at H=4 (R+3), spanning C-2 to C+2 (columns 2-6). Length 5.\n\nVertical line from R=1 to H=4 (rows 1-4, column 4).\n\nSo for this case, K=3 (distance from original row to horizontal line), L=2 (span from C).\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in Example 0:\n\nOriginal R=10, C=4.\n\nHorizontal line at H=7 (10-3), spanning C-2 to C+2 (columns 2-6). Vertical line from H=7 to R=10 (rows 7-10, column 4).\n\nSo K=3 again, L=2.\n\nSo for both 2 and 8, K is 3, L is 2. But then what determines K and L? For 2 and 8, it's the same. So maybe K is fixed at 3, L is fixed at 2, regardless of the number. But then why are there different numbers? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, but in Example 1's 3:\n\nOriginal R=6, C=1.\n\nHorizontal line is in row 6 itself (H=6), spanning columns 1-5 (C=1 to C+4). So L=4 here. Vertical lines are from row 6 up to row 4 and down to row 8. So K=0 (horizontal line is same row), and L=4.\n\nBut that's different from previous examples. So this breaks the pattern.\n\nHmm, maybe the numbers determine the length of the horizontal line. For example, in Example 1, 3's horizontal line is 5 elements (columns 1-5). So 3+1=4, which is L=2? Not sure. Or maybe it's (number +1) / 2. For 3: (3+1)/2=2, so L=2. But columns 1-5 is 5 elements, which is C \u00b1 2, so 1-2 to 1+2 would be columns -1 to 3, which isn't the case. So this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the horizontal line's length is always 5 elements, centered around the original column. For example, in Example 0, C=4, so 4-2 to 4+2 (columns 2-6). For Example 1's 3, C=1. 1-2 would be -1, so clamped to 0. But in the output, the horizontal line starts at column 1 and spans to 5. So maybe it's 5 elements starting from the original column. For C=1, it's columns 1-5. For C=4, 4-2 to 4+2. So perhaps when possible, the horizontal line is centered, but if near the edge, it starts from the column and spans to the right.\n\nIn that case, for each number, the horizontal line is 5 elements long, either centered on the original column or starting from it if there's not enough space. But why 5 elements? Maybe it's a fixed length for all numbers. Then the vertical line connects the original position to the horizontal line, which is 3 rows away.\n\nBut why 3 rows? For example 0's 2, the horizontal line is 3 rows below. For 8, 3 rows above. For 3 in Example 1, the horizontal line is in the same row. So that contradicts the previous pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line's row is determined by the number modulo some value. For example, if even numbers go down, odd numbers go up, but that doesn't fit.\n\nIn Example 1's 3 (odd), the horizontal line is in the same row. In Example 0's 2 (even), it's 3 rows below. 8 (even) is 3 rows above. So even numbers can go up or down. That doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps the direction is determined by whether the number is in the upper or lower half of the grid. But in Example 0, 2 is near the top, so horizontal line is below. 8 is near the bottom, so horizontal line is above. That makes sense. So the horizontal line is placed 3 rows away from the original, in the direction towards the center of the grid. For example, in a grid with 14 rows (Example 0), the middle is around row 7. The 2 is in row 1, so direction is down (toward the center). The 8 is in row 10, so direction is up (toward row 7). But how is 3 rows chosen? The distance from the original row to the horizontal line is 3.\n\nBut in Example 1's 3 is in row 6 of a 10-row grid (the input has 10 rows). The middle would be around row 5. So placing the horizontal line in row 6 (the same row) would be towards the center? Not sure. But in Example 1's output, the horizontal line for 3 is in row 6, same as the original. Then the vertical lines go up and down from there.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Maybe the horizontal line is placed 3 rows below for numbers in the upper half and 3 rows above for lower half, but for numbers near the middle, it's in the same row. But how to determine the threshold.\n\nAlternatively, the horizontal line is placed in the same row for odd numbers and 3 rows away for even numbers. But Example 1's 3 is odd and horizontal line is same row. Example 0's 2 even, 3 rows away. Example 0's 8 even, 3 rows away. Example 2's 5 (odd) is in row 5 (input), and the horizontal line is same row. So perhaps for odd numbers, the horizontal line is in the same row, and for even, 3 rows away (up or down based on position). But how to determine direction.\n\nBut in Example 2's 5 (odd), the horizontal line is same row, and the 8 (even) is placed 3 rows away. Let's see: in Example 2's input, the 5 is in row 5. The output's horizontal line for 5 is in row 5 (same), columns 3-8. The 8 is in row 5, column 17. The horizontal line for 8 would be 3 rows away. Since the grid has 9 rows (input has 9 rows), row 5 is the middle. So maybe for even numbers, the horizontal line is placed 3 rows above if near the bottom, or below if near the top.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0, 2's horizontal line is in row 4 (3 rows below original row 1), and the vertical line connects row 1 to row 4. Then, below the horizontal line, there are additional lines. For example, in row 5, columns 2 and 6 have 2. In row 6, columns 2 and 6 have 8, but those are part of the 8's structure. So maybe the 2's structure is a vertical line down to the horizontal line, and then two more vertical lines branching out from the ends of the horizontal line. So the overall shape is like a capital 'T' with a vertical line extending below the horizontal line.\n\nBut how does this relate to the number? For 2, the horizontal line is 5 elements, and then vertical lines below the ends. For 8, the horizontal line is 5 elements, and vertical lines above and below the ends.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number creates a sort of \"arrow\" shape. For even numbers, the arrow points down, and for odd, up. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the number's value determines the number of segments in the shape. For example, 2 creates two segments. But I can't see how that applies.\n\nLet's look at the Test Input now. The test input has a 7 in row 1, column 3, and a 6 in row 16, column 3. Following the patterns from the examples, what would their outputs look like?\n\nAssuming that for even numbers like 6 and 8, the horizontal line is placed 3 rows above or below. Since 7 is odd, perhaps the horizontal line is in the same row. Then, a vertical line would connect the original position to the horizontal line. The horizontal line's length is 5 elements.\n\nFor the test input:\n\n7 in row 1, column 3. Since 7 is odd, horizontal line is in the same row (row 1), spanning columns 1-5 (since centered at column 3). So columns 3-2=1 to 3+2=5. Then, vertical line from row 1 to row 1 (same row) which is just the horizontal line. But that doesn't make sense. Maybe the vertical line extends from the horizontal line down. Or perhaps for odd numbers, the vertical line is above and below the horizontal line.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the 3 (odd) has a horizontal line in row 6, and vertical lines going up and down from there. So for 3, the vertical lines are rows 4-8 (row 6 is the center). So for odd numbers, the horizontal line is in the same row, and vertical lines extend up and down by (number) rows? For 3, vertical lines extend 3 rows up and down, making a cross of 7 rows total (3 up, 3 down, plus center). But in Example 1's 3, the vertical line spans rows 4-8 (5 rows), which is 2 up and 2 down from row 6. So perhaps the vertical length is (number -1)/2. For 3, (3-1)/2=1, so 1 row up and down. Wait, that doesn't fit. Example 1's 3 has vertical lines from row 4 to 8, which is 5 rows. 3 rows up from 6 is row 3, down to row 9. But the output only has rows up to 9 (0-based? The input has 10 rows). So maybe it's adjusted to fit.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical line extends (number) rows up and down. But for 3, that would be 3 up and 3 down. But row 6 can't go up 3 rows (rows 3-6) and down 3 (rows 6-9). But in the output, the vertical lines for 3 are rows 4-8, which is 5 rows. So maybe it's 2 rows up and 2 down.\n\nThis is getting too ambiguous. Let's try to summarize possible rules:\n\nFor each number N in the input:\n\n1. If N is even:\n\n   a. Place a horizontal line N/2 rows away from the original row, either up or down depending on the original row's position.\n\n   b. The horizontal line is centered on the original column and spans 5 elements.\n\n   c. Draw a vertical line from the original row to the horizontal line.\n\n2. If N is odd:\n\n   a. Place the horizontal line in the same row as the original.\n\n   b. The horizontal line spans (N+1) elements.\n\n   c. Draw vertical lines extending up and down from the horizontal line.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the horizontal line is always 5 elements long and centered on the original column. For even numbers, the horizontal line is 3 rows away (up or down based on the original row's position), and a vertical line connects the original to the horizontal line. For odd numbers, the horizontal line is in the same row, and vertical lines extend up and down from it for N rows.\n\nBut in Example 1's 3 (odd):\n\n- Horizontal line is same row (6), 5 elements (columns 1-5).\n\n- Vertical lines extend up to row 4 and down to row 8 (2 rows up and down), making 5 rows total. So 3 may be split into 2 up and down.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical lines for odd numbers extend floor(N/2) rows up and ceil(N/2) rows down. For 3: 1 up and 2 down. But in Example 1's output, it's 2 up and 2 down. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 in row 1 and the 8 in row 10 each form a sort of \"arrow\" pointing towards the center of the grid. The horizontal lines for both are in row 4 and 7, which are closer to the center.\n\nExample 1's 3 and 1 form crosses in the center row (row 6), with their horizontal lines in the same row, and vertical lines extending up and down.\n\nExample 2's 5 and 8 form horizontal lines in the same row (row 5) for the 5, and for the 8, perhaps in another row.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the 5 is in row 5, column 3, and the output's horizontal line is in row 5, columns 3-8. The 8 is in row 5, column 17 (but the input has 18 columns?), so the output's horizontal line for 8 is columns 11-16.\n\nBut how does this fit with previous examples? For 5 (odd), horizontal line in the same row. For 8 (even), horizontal line in row 5-3=2? Or perhaps the same row, but the horizontal line is centered elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the horizontal line's position is determined by the number's value. For example, 2 has horizontal line 3 rows down (2+1=3?), 8 has horizontal line 3 rows up (8 mod 5=3?), but this is just speculation.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, maybe I should try to apply the pattern observed in the examples to the test input.\n\nThe test input has 7 in row 1, column 3, and 6 in row 16, column 3.\n\nAssuming that 7 is odd, so the horizontal line is in the same row (row 1). The horizontal line is 5 elements long, centered at column 3: columns 1-5. Then vertical lines extending up and down from the horizontal line. But since the original position is row 1, there's no rows above. So vertical lines would go down from row 1. How far? Maybe floor(7/2) =3 rows down. So from row 1 to row 4. Then, for each end of the horizontal line (columns 1 and 5), there are vertical lines going down. So rows 1-4, columns 1 and 5 are filled with 7.\n\nFor the 6, which is even, the horizontal line is placed 3 rows away. Since the original is row 16 (near the bottom), the horizontal line would be 3 rows above (row 13). The horizontal line is centered at column 3, spanning columns 1-5. Then a vertical line from row 16 down to row 13. Wait, but row 16 to 13 is upwards. So vertical line from row 13 to 16, column 3. Then, the horizontal line is row 13, columns 1-5 (6 values? 1,2,3,4,5).\n\nAdditionally, the ends of the horizontal line (columns 1 and 5) might have vertical lines extending further. For example, from row 13, columns 1 and 5, vertical lines down to row 16.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nFor the test input:\n\nThe 7 in row 1, column 3 would generate:\n\n- Horizontal line in row 1, columns 1-5 (7s).\n- Vertical lines from row 1 down to row 4, columns 1 and 5 (7s).\n\nThe 6 in row 16, column 3 would generate:\n\n- Horizontal line in row 13, columns 1-5 (6s).\n- Vertical line from row 13 up to row 16, column 3 (6s).\n- Vertical lines from row 13 down to row 16 (but row 16 is the original, so perhaps row 13 to 16 is covered by the vertical line).\n\nBut also, the ends of the horizontal line (columns 1 and 5) might have vertical lines extending down. For example, rows 13-16, columns 1 and 5 are 6s.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on previous examples.\n\nThen, combining these two shapes:\n\nThe output would have the horizontal lines for 7 and 6 in their respective rows, vertical lines connecting, and additional vertical lines at the ends of the horizontal lines.\n\nPutting this all together, the final output would look like:\n\nRows for 7:\n\nRow 1: [0,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0] (columns 1-5 as 7s).\nRows 2,3,4: columns 1 and 5 as 7s.\n\nRows for 6:\n\nRow 13: [0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0] (columns 1-5).\nRows 13-16, column 3 as 6s.\nRows 13-16, columns 1 and 5 as 6s.\n\nOther rows are 0.\n\nSo the final output would have these elements. But how exactly? Let's try to draft it.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 No, because the horizontal line for 7 is here. Wait, the test input's row 1 is [0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0]. The output's row 1 would have 7s from column 1-5. So:\n\nRow 1: [0,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0]\n\nRows 2,3,4: in columns 1 and 5, 7s.\n\nRow 2: [0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]\n\nFor the 6 in row 16 (original input row 16 is [0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0]), the horizontal line is in row 13.\n\nRow 13: [0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0]\n\nThen vertical lines from row 13 to 16 in column 3, and columns 1 and 5.\n\nSo rows 13-16:\n\nRow 13: [0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0]\n\nRow 14: [0,6,0,6,0,6,0,0,0]\n\nRow 15: [0,6,0,6,0,6,0,0,0]\n\nRow 16: [0,6,0,6,0,6,0,0,0]\n\nBut the original 6 is in row 16, column 3. So row 16 would have 6 in column 3 as part of the vertical line. Also, the vertical line from row 13 to 16 in column 3 would have 6s in all those rows.\n\nSo adjusting:\n\nRow 13: [0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0]\n\nRow 14: [0,6,0,6,0,6,0,0,0]\n\nRow 15: [0,6,0,6,0,6,0,0,0]\n\nRow 16: [0,6,0,6,0,6,0,0,0]\n\nBut the original 6 is in row 16, column 3. So that's already covered in the vertical line.\n\nSo combining all these, the output grid would have the 7's structure in the upper part and the 6's structure lower.\n\nBut there are other rows in between that may be zero. The test input has 19 rows (0-18). So rows 5-12 are all zeros, except if the vertical lines from 7 or 6 extend there. But according to the pattern from examples, perhaps the vertical lines are only from the original row to the horizontal line. For the 7, horizontal line is row 1 (same row), so vertical lines down from row 1, columns 1 and 5 for 3 rows (rows 1-4). For the 6, horizontal line is row 13, vertical lines from row 13 down to 16, columns 1,3,5.\n\nThus, the final output would look something like this (but I need to format it correctly).",
