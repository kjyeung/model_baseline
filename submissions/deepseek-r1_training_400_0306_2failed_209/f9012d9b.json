        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the input matrices and their corresponding outputs and find the transformation rule. Then apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at the training examples:\n\nStarting with Example 0:\nInput has 5 rows. The output is two rows. The output rows are [1,1] and [2,1]. Let's see how those might relate to the input. Let's check the input rows:\n\nRow 0: [2,1,2,1,2]\nRow 1: [1,1,1,1,1]\nRow 2: [2,1,2,1,2]\nRow 3: [0,0,1,1,1]\nRow 4: [0,0,2,1,2]\n\nThe output is two rows. Maybe each output row corresponds to some transformation of certain input rows. Let's see the positions of the output elements. For the first output row [1,1], maybe they are from the middle of the input rows. Looking at the input rows, row 1 is all 1s. But the output rows have two elements. Maybe each output row is taking the middle element from two different rows? Or perhaps it's looking for rows where the elements are the same and taking their values. Wait, in example 0, the first output row is [1,1]. Let me check the input rows. Row 1 is all 1s. The output rows might be selecting certain rows and taking parts of them. Alternatively, maybe it's looking for the most frequent elements in certain positions across the rows. Alternatively, maybe the output is the central part of the input matrix when some condition is met.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking elements from the input rows where there's a certain pattern. For example, in example 0, the output rows [1,1] and [2,1]. Let's see where 1,1 and 2,1 appear in the input. The first row of the output is [1,1], which could be from the first input row's middle elements (since row 1 is [1,1,1,1,1], so taking the middle three elements and then taking the first two? Wait, but row1 is all 1s, so any two consecutive would be 1,1. But why pick those? Maybe not that.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is the elements that are in the same position in the input rows, but only for rows that have a certain property, like being a palindrome. Let's check. For example 0:\n\nRow 0: [2,1,2,1,2] is symmetric. Yes, it's a palindrome. Row 1 is all 1s, so also a palindrome. Row 2 is same as row 0. Row3: [0,0,1,1,1] is not a palindrome. Row4: [0,0,2,1,2]\u2014not a palindrome. So the palindromic rows are 0,1,2. The output has two rows. Let's see the outputs. The first output row is [1,1], which could be the middle elements of row 1 (since row1 is [1,1,1,1,1], the middle three are positions 1-3 (assuming 0-based). Wait, the middle of 5 elements is index 2. Wait, 5 elements, indexes 0-4. The middle three would be indexes 1,2,3. But the output rows are two elements. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe for each palindromic row, take the first two elements. But row0 starts with 2,1. Row1 starts with 1,1. Row2 starts with 2,1. But the output's first row is [1,1], which is row1's first two. The second output row is [2,1], which is row0's first two. So maybe for each palindromic row, take the first two elements, but sorted in some way? Or maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, but the output has two rows. The first output row is [1,1], which is row1's first two. The second is [2,1], which is row0's first two. But row2 is same as row0. So why not have three rows? But the output only has two. So maybe in example 0, the output is taking the first two elements of each palindromic row, but only for the first two such rows. That doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the two elements that are in the center of each palindromic row. But for row0 (length 5), the center three elements are indexes 1,2,3. Wait, but for a palindrome of odd length, the center is the middle element. So for row0, the middle element is 2. But the output is [1,1] and [2,1], which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by looking at the first two elements of the rows that are palindromes, but after certain transformations. For example, in example0, the palindromic rows are 0,1,2. The first two elements of row0 are [2,1], row1 [1,1], row2 [2,1]. If the output is taking the first two elements of each palindromic row, but only unique ones, then [2,1], [1,1]. But the output is [1,1], [2,1]. Maybe sorted by the first element. So 1 comes before 2, so row1 comes first. That's possible. Then in example0, output is the first two elements of palindromic rows, ordered by their first element.\n\nBut let's check example1:\n\nInput is four rows:\n\n[8,6,0,6]\n\n[6,8,6,8]\n\n[8,6,8,6]\n\n[6,8,6,8]\n\nOutput is [8].\n\nCheck which rows are palindromic. Row0: [8,6,0,6]. Reverse is [6,0,6,8]. Not same. Row1: [6,8,6,8]. Reverse is [8,6,8,6], which is row2. So row1's reverse is row2, but row1 is not a palindrome. So none of the rows are palindromes. So that approach can't be right. Hmm.\n\nSo maybe the palindrome idea is wrong.\n\nAnother approach: look for symmetry in the entire matrix. For example, in example0, maybe the output is the center elements. But how?\n\nAlternative idea: for each row in the input, check if it's equal to the row below it. Then, for rows that are followed by an identical row, take certain elements. Not sure.\n\nLooking at example0's input again:\n\nThe input has 5 rows. The output has two rows. The output rows might be formed by combining elements from certain positions. Let's check if the output elements appear in the input. The first output row is [1,1]. Looking at the input, row1 is all 1s. Maybe the output rows are the first two elements of the row that is entirely made of 1s. But example0's output has two rows. The first is [1,1], which is the first two of row1. The second is [2,1], which is the first two of row0 and row2. But why those rows?\n\nAnother angle: maybe each output row is the first two elements of a row in the input that has a certain property. For example, in example0, the first output row is [1,1] from row1 (all 1s). The second output row is [2,1] from row0 and row2. Maybe the rule is that if a row is a palindrome, take the first two elements. But in example1, there are no palindromic rows, but the output is [8]. How does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the elements from the positions where the column has a certain property. For example, columns that are the same across all rows. Let's check example0's columns:\n\nColumn 0: 2,1,2,0,0 \u2192 not the same.\n\nColumn1: 1,1,1,0,0 \u2192 no.\n\nColumn2: 2,1,2,1,2 \u2192 in rows 0-4. Wait, rows 0,1,2: column 2 is 2,1,2. Rows 3 and 4 have 1 and 2 in column2. So not all same.\n\nBut in example0's output, the first output row is [1,1], which could be from row1's columns 0-1. The second output row [2,1] from row0's columns 0-1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first two elements of the rows that are the same as the row below them. Let's see:\n\nIn example0, row0 is [2,1,2,1,2]. Row1 is [1,1,1,1,1]. Not same. Row1 to row2: row2 is [2,1,2,1,2]. So row0 and row2 are same. So rows 0 and 2 are same, but separated by row1. So maybe when consecutive rows are same, take their first two elements. But in example0, there's no consecutive same rows. So this idea may not work.\n\nAnother approach: look for rows that have the same value in their first and last element. For example, in example0:\n\nRow0: starts with 2 and ends with 2. So same.\n\nRow1: starts and ends with 1.\n\nRow2: same as row0.\n\nRow3: starts with 0, ends with 1. Not same.\n\nRow4: starts with 0, ends with 2. Not same.\n\nSo the rows that start and end with the same element are 0,1,2. The output rows are [1,1] and [2,1]. The first two elements of rows 1,0,2. But again, the output has two rows, but there are three such rows.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the first two elements of each such row, but grouped in some way. For example, in example0, row0 and row2 are the same. So maybe group them and take once. So rows 0 and 2 are same, so take their first two elements once ([2,1]), and row1 ([1,1]). So output is [1,1] and [2,1], which is the order in the example. That fits.\n\nThen, in example1:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[8,6,0,6]\n\n[6,8,6,8]\n\n[8,6,8,6]\n\n[6,8,6,8]\n\nCheck which rows start and end with the same element:\n\nRow0: 8 and 6 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1:6 and8 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2:8 and6 \u2192 no.\n\nRow3:6 and8 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm, none. So according to this rule, there's no output rows. But the output is [8]. So this approach is invalid.\n\nHmm. So that's not it.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe the output is the majority element in each column, but only for certain columns. Let's check example0's columns.\n\nFor each column in example0:\n\nColumn 0: [2,1,2,0,0] \u2192 majority is 0 and 2 (each appears twice) and 1 once. So no clear majority.\n\nBut perhaps not.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output rows in example0, they are [1,1] and [2,1]. These could be the two middle elements of the first three rows. For example, row1 is all 1s, so middle elements (positions 2 and 3?) but the output is two elements. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the first occurrence of a certain pattern in the input. For example, in example0, the output rows are [1,1] and [2,1]. These are the first two elements of the first two rows that have the same first two elements. But row0 and row2 have [2,1], and row1 has [1,1]. So the output lists these unique pairs. So the output is the unique first two elements of each row, ordered by their occurrence. Then in example0, the unique pairs are [2,1], [1,1], so the output lists them in the order they first appeared. But in the output, [1,1] comes first. Wait, row1 is the second row, so that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the unique pairs of first two elements sorted in some order. For example, in example0, the pairs are [2,1], [1,1], [2,1], [0,0], [0,0]. The unique pairs are [2,1], [1,1], [0,0]. But the output doesn't include [0,0]. So that can't be.\n\nHmm.\n\nLooking at example1:\n\nInput has four rows. The output is [8]. How to get that?\n\nThe input rows are:\n\nRow0:8,6,0,6\n\nRow1:6,8,6,8\n\nRow2:8,6,8,6\n\nRow3:6,8,6,8\n\nThe output is [8]. So maybe the output is the element that appears in the center of the matrix. But the matrix is 4 rows. The center would be rows 2 and 3. Not sure. The output is a single element. Alternatively, the output could be the element that is in the same position in all rows. For example, check if all rows have the same element in some position. Let's see:\n\nColumn0: 8,6,8,6 \u2192 alternates, not same.\n\nColumn1:6,8,6,8 \u2192 alternates.\n\nColumn2:0,6,8,6 \u2192 not same.\n\nColumn3:6,8,6,8 \u2192 alternates.\n\nSo no column has all the same elements. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is the elements that are in the diagonal of the matrix. For example, in example1's input:\n\nRow0:8 (index0), row1:8 (index1), row2:8 (index2), row3:8 (index3). Wait, the diagonal elements (assuming square matrix) would be row0[0]=8, row1[1]=8, row2[2]=8, row3[3]=8. All 8s. So the diagonal is all 8s, hence the output is [8]. That fits example1's output. But example0's output isn't diagonal elements. Let's check example0's diagonal.\n\nExample0's input is a 5x5 matrix. The diagonal elements would be [2 (row0[0]), 1 (row1[1]), 2 (row2[2]), 1 (row3[3]), 2 (row4[4])]. So [2,1,2,1,2]. The output is [1,1] and [2,1]. So that doesn't match. So perhaps this idea works for example1 but not others.\n\nAlternatively, in example1, maybe the output is the element that is present in all rows. Let's see:\n\nRow0: 8,6,0,6. Elements are 8,6,0.\n\nRow1:6,8,6,8. Elements 6,8.\n\nRow2:8,6,8,6. Elements 8,6.\n\nRow3:6,8,6,8. Elements 6,8.\n\nSo the common elements across all rows are 6 and 8. But the output is [8]. So maybe the output is the maximum of the common elements. So 8. But how does that fit with other examples.\n\nLooking at example0's input:\n\nRows have elements 0,1,2. All rows have 1 and 2 and 0. But the output is [1,1] and [2,1]. Not sure.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother angle: let's look at the output structure. For example, in example0, the output has two rows. Each output row is two elements. Maybe each output row corresponds to a pair of rows in the input. For example, take the first element of each pair of rows and combine them. But not sure.\n\nLooking at example2's input and output:\n\nInput is a 7x7 matrix. Output is two rows [5,5] and [5,2].\n\nLooking for a pattern here. The input rows:\n\nRow0:2,2,5,2,2,5,2\n\nRow1: same as row0.\n\nRow2: all 5s.\n\nRow3: same as row0.\n\nRow4: same as row0.\n\nRow5:5,5,5,5,5,0,0\n\nRow6:2,2,5,2,2,0,0\n\nThe output rows are [5,5] and [5,2]. How are these derived? Let's see where 5,5 appears. Row2 is all 5s. So maybe the first output row is the first two elements of row2, which are 5,5. Then the second output row could be from row5's first two elements (5,5) but no. Or maybe from row6's first two (2,2), but output is [5,2]. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows could be the last two elements of certain rows. For example, row5 ends with 0,0. Row6 ends with 0,0. But output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Not matching.\n\nAnother thought: in example2, the output rows [5,5] and [5,2] could be the elements from the middle of the rows. Let's check row5:5,5,5,5,5,0,0. Middle elements (positions 3-4 in 0-based indexing) would be 5,5. Wait, the middle of seven elements is index3, so maybe taking index3 and 4? Or 2,3,4. But the output is two elements. So maybe for row5, the middle two elements are 5 and5. For row6:2,2,5,2,2,0,0. Middle elements (index3 is 2, index4 is 2. So [2,2], but the output is [5,2]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are the elements that are surrounded by the same number. For example, in row5, the fifth element is 0. But not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: look for the output elements in the input matrix and see if they form a certain pattern. For example, in example2's output, [5,5] could be from row2's first two elements (5,5) if row2 was all 5s. Yes. Row2 is all 5s. So [5,5] would be the first two elements of row2. The second output row is [5,2]. Where does that come from? Looking for 5 followed by 2. In row0, elements are 2,2,5,2,2,5,2. So index2 is 5, then index3 is 2. So 5,2 appears in row0 at positions 2 and3. So maybe the output is taking elements from certain positions in the input rows. For example, for each row, if the row is uniform (all same elements), take the first two elements. Then for other rows, take elements from positions where there's a transition. But example2's row5 is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], which is not uniform. The first five are 5, then two zeros. The output row [5,5] could be the first two elements of row2 (all 5s), and [5,2] could be from another row. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in example2, the output is two rows. The first is [5,5], which could be the last two elements of the row2 (all 5s). The row2 is seven elements, so last two are 5,5. Wait, but row2 is all 5s, so all elements are 5. So why [5,5] and not [5,5,5...]. But output is two elements. Maybe the output rows are formed by taking the first two elements of the first row that is all the same, then the next row where a certain condition is met. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the two middle elements of certain rows. For example, row2 in example2 has seven elements, so middle three are positions3, which is 5. Wait, seven elements, indexes 0-6. Middle is 3. So the middle element is 5. But the output row is two elements, so maybe taking the middle two elements. For even-length rows? But the rows in example0 are of length5, odd. So this might not apply.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a common pattern across all examples.\n\nExample0's output is two rows. Each output row is two elements. Let's think about possible relations between input and output.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is formed by taking the first occurrence of a unique pair of elements that appear in consecutive rows and columns. For example, in example0:\n\nLooking for pairs (a, b) where in the input, a appears in row i, column j and b appears in row i+1, column j. Then find such pairs that only appear once.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the elements that form the \"border\" of the matrix. For example, in example0, the first output row [1,1] could be from the center of the matrix, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as layers, and the output is peeling off layers. For example, example0 is a 5x5 matrix. Removing the outer layer leaves a 3x3 matrix. Removing another layer leaves a single element. But example0's output has two rows, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the test input and see if any patterns emerge there. The test input is:\n\n[8, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8]\n\n[1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1]\n\n[8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8]\n\n[8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8]\n\nThis is a 7x7 matrix. The output needs to be determined based on the pattern from the examples.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, perhaps the output is the first two elements of each row that is a palindrome. Let's test this:\n\nExample0: Rows 0,1,2 are palindromes. Their first two elements are [2,1], [1,1], [2,1]. The output has [1,1] and [2,1], which are the unique pairs, sorted or ordered by row index. So row1 comes first, then row0.\n\nExample1: None of the rows are palindromes, but the output is [8]. So this contradicts the idea.\n\nExample2: Rows0,1,3,4 are palindromes (since they're same as example0's rows). Row2 is all 5s, which is a palindrome. Row5 is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], which is not a palindrome. Row6 is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0], which is not a palindrome. So the palindromic rows are 0,1,2,3,4. Their first two elements are [2,2], [2,2], [5,5], [2,2], [2,2]. The unique pairs are [2,2], [5,5]. But the output is [5,5] and [5,2]. So this doesn't fit. So this idea is invalid.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output rows are the two most frequent elements in certain positions. For example, in example1's output, 8 is the most frequent in the diagonal. But how to verify.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output is formed by the elements at the intersection of certain rows and columns where the element is the same as its neighbor in a certain direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that form the \"core\" of the matrix after removing duplicates. For example, in example0's input, the core could be the central 3x3 matrix. Then, the output is the first two elements of that core. But example0's output is [1,1] and [2,1]. The core would be rows 1-3 and columns 1-3. Row1 is [1,1,1,1,1], so core columns 1-3 are [1,1,1]. Row2 is [2,1,2,1,2], core columns are [1,2,1]. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the elements that are present in the same position in all rows. For example, in example1, the output is [8]. Let's check if there's any column where all elements are 8. Columns in example1:\n\nColumn0:8,6,8,6 \u2192 elements 8 and6 alternately. Not all 8.\n\nColumn1:6,8,6,8 \u2192 alternately 6 and8.\n\nColumn2:0,6,8,6 \u2192 0,6,8,6. Not same.\n\nColumn3:6,8,6,8 \u2192 6 and8.\n\nNo column has all 8. So this can't be.\n\nWait, example1's output is [8]. Maybe the output is the element that appears in all rows but not in all columns. For example, 8 appears in all rows. Let's check:\n\nRow0:8 is present.\n\nRow1:8 is present.\n\nRow2:8 is present.\n\nRow3:8 is present.\n\nSo yes, 8 is present in every row. Other elements:6 is also present in every row. But the output is [8]. So maybe the output is the maximum element that appears in all rows. 8 is higher than6. So in example1, output is [8]. In example0, elements present in all rows: 0 is in rows3 and4, but not in rows0-2. So 1 and2 are present in all rows except rows3 and4. Hmm, no. Example0's rows0-2 have 2,1. Rows3-4 have 0. So no element is present in all rows. So how does that fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps not.\n\nLooking at example2's output [5,5] and [5,2]. Are 5 and2 present in all rows? Let's check. Row0:5 is present. Row1:5. Row2:5. Row3:5. Row4:5. Row5:5. Row6:5. So yes, 5 is present in all rows. 2 is present in all rows except row2. So no. So why the output includes [5,2]. So this idea is not applicable.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from rows that form a certain pattern when stacked. For example, in example0, the output rows are [1,1] and [2,1]. Looking at the input matrix, the first three rows form a pattern where the middle row is all 1s, and the other rows are 2,1,2,1,2. The output could be the middle elements of these rows. But not sure.\n\nAnother thought: the output could be the elements that are at the end of sequences of repeated numbers. For example, in example0's first row, all 1s. The end is 1. But output rows are two elements. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs again. The outputs in the examples are:\n\nExample0:\n\n[1,1]\n\n[2,1]\n\nExample1:\n\n[8]\n\nExample2:\n\n[5,5]\n\n[5,2]\n\nLooking for a pattern in the outputs. For example, example0's output is the first two elements of row1 and row0. Example1's output is the element that's in the first position of all rows. Row0:8, row1:6, row2:8, row3:6. So first elements are 8,6,8,6. So 8 and6 alternate. The output is [8]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are in the same position in the first and last row. For example0's first row is [2,1,2,1,2], last row is [0,0,2,1,2]. The elements in the same positions: 2 vs0, 1 vs0, 2 vs2, 1 vs1, 2 vs2. So positions where they are the same are 2, 3,4 (indexes 2,3,4). But the output is [1,1] and [2,1]. Not matching.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's look at the test input and see if any pattern from the examples can be applied. The test input is a 7x7 matrix. Let's see:\n\nRow0:8,1,8,8,0,0,0\n\nRow1:1,8,8,1,0,0,0\n\nRow2:8,8,1,8,0,0,0\n\nRow3:8,1,8,8,1,8,8\n\nRow4:1,8,8,1,8,8,1\n\nRow5:8,8,1,8,8,1,8\n\nRow6:8,1,8,8,1,8,8\n\nLooking for possible patterns. For example, perhaps the output is the first two elements of rows that are palindromes. Let's check each row:\n\nRow0: [8,1,8,8,0,0,0] \u2192 reverse is [0,0,0,8,8,1,8]. Not a palindrome.\n\nRow1: [1,8,8,1,0,0,0] \u2192 reverse is [0,0,0,1,8,8,1]. Not the same.\n\nRow2: [8,8,1,8,0,0,0] \u2192 reverse [0,0,0,8,1,8,8]. Not same.\n\nRow3: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8] \u2192 reverse is [8,8,1,8,8,1,8]. Which is the same as row5. But not a palindrome.\n\nRow4: [1,8,8,1,8,8,1] \u2192 reverse is same as the row. Because first element is 1, last is1. Second is8, second last is8. Third is8, third last is8. Fourth is1. So yes, row4 is a palindrome.\n\nRow5: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8] \u2192 reverse is [8,1,8,8,1,8,8]. Which is row3. Not a palindrome.\n\nRow6: [8,1,8,8,1,8,8] \u2192 reverse is same as row3. Not a palindrome.\n\nSo only row4 is a palindrome. So if the pattern is to take the first two elements of palindromic rows, then the output would have one row: [1,8]. But looking at the training examples, this may not fit. For example, example1's output is [8], but there are no palindromic rows. So this is probably not the case.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's consider the possibility that the output is formed by the elements that appear in the same position in the matrix when mirrored either vertically or horizontally. For example, in example0's input, the first row is a palindrome, so mirroring it would leave the same elements. The output may be taking elements from symmetric positions.\n\nAnother Idea: Looking at example0's output again: [1,1] and [2,1]. These are the first two elements of rows1 and 0. Now, in example0's input, rows 0,2, and 1 are palindromes. If the output is the first two elements of the palindromic rows but only the unique ones, then example0's output would have [1,1], [2,1]. Then, example1's output is [8], which must be derived from some other pattern. Perhaps for non-palindromic rows, take the maximum element in the row. Let's check example1's rows:\n\nRow0:8,6,0,6 \u2192 max 8.\n\nRow1:6,8,6,8 \u2192 max 8.\n\nRow2:8,6,8,6 \u2192 max 8.\n\nRow3:6,8,6,8 \u2192 max8.\n\nSo all rows have max8, so output is [8]. That fits. For example0's non-palindromic rows (rows3 and4), their max elements are 1 and2. But example0's output doesn't include these. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example2's input, the output is [5,5] and [5,2]. The max in each row:\n\nRow0:5.\n\nRow1:5.\n\nRow2:5.\n\nRow3:5.\n\nRow4:5.\n\nRow5:5.\n\nRow6:5.\n\nSo max is 5 for all rows. But output includes [5,2]. So this idea is invalid.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the output is the elements that are at the intersection of the rows and columns where the element is the same as the element diagonally opposite. For example, in example0's input, the diagonal elements are 2,1,2,1,2. But the output is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by the elements that are in the same position in the matrix when it is rotated. For example, in example1's input, rotating 180 degrees and seeing which elements remain the same. But not sure.\n\nThis is getting quite challenging. Let's try to find a pattern that fits all training examples and can be applied to the test input.\n\nLet me try to look for another pattern. Let's consider the number of output rows in each example:\n\nExample0: 2 output rows.\n\nExample1: 1 output row.\n\nExample2: 2 output rows.\n\nThe test input is a 7-row matrix. So the output could have 2 or 1 rows. Let's see.\n\nLooking at example0's input and output:\n\nInput has 5 rows, output 2 rows. The output rows are the first two elements of the first two rows that are palindromic. But in example0, there are three palindromic rows (0,1,2). So why only two output rows? Maybe the output is the first two palindromic rows' first two elements. So row0 and row1. Row0's first two are [2,1], row1's are [1,1]. But the output is [1,1] first. So maybe sorted.\n\nAlternatively, the output is sorted based on the elements. [1,1] comes before [2,1]. So sorted lex order.\n\nIn example1, since there are no palindromic rows, the output is [8]. How to get that? Maybe when there are no palindromic rows, output the maximum element across all rows. In example1's case, 8 is the max. So example1's output is [8].\n\nIn example2, there are palindromic rows. For example, row0 is [2,2,5,2,2,5,2]. Let's check if it's a palindrome. Reversed: [2,5,2,2,5,2,2]. No, because the original is [2,2,5,2,2,5,2]. Reversed would be [2,5,2,2,5,2,2], which is different. So row0 is not a palindrome. Row2 is all 5s, so it's a palindrome. Row5 is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], not a palindrome. Row4 is [2,2,5,2,2,5,2], same as row0. Not a palindrome. Only row2 is a palindrome. But example2's output has two rows. So this idea is invalid.\n\nHmm. Let's try a different approach. Let's look at the positions of the output elements in the input matrix.\n\nFor example0's output [1,1] and [2,1]:\n\nLooking at the input matrix, the first output row [1,1] is from row1, columns0-1.\n\nThe second output row [2,1] is from row0, columns0-1.\n\nSo perhaps the output is the first two elements of the first two rows that have a certain property.\n\nWhat's the property of row1 and row0?\n\nRow1 is all 1s. Row0 is a palindrome. So maybe the first two rows that are either all same or palindromic.\n\nIn example0, row0 is a palindrome, row1 is all same. So they are the first two such rows, and their first two elements are taken.\n\nExample1 has no rows that are palindromes or all same. So output is the maximum element in the entire matrix (which is 8).\n\nExample2's output has [5,5] which is from row2 (all 5s). Then [5,2] which is from row5. Row5 is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. First two elements are 5,5. But the output is [5,5] and [5,2]. The second output row is [5,2], which could be from another row. Let's check. Maybe row6: [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. First two are 2,2. Not matching. Row3: [2,2,5,2,2,5,2]. First two are 2,2. Hmm. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in example2, the output is formed by taking the first two elements of the row that is all same (row2) and then another row which has a different pattern. But what's the other row?\n\nThis approach isn't leading to a clear pattern.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's look at the test input and see if any pattern from the examples can be applied. For instance, if the output is the first two elements of rows that are all the same or palindromes, then in the test input:\n\nRow4 is a palindrome. Its first two elements are [1,8].\n\nRow5 is not a palindrome. Row6 is not. So perhaps the output would be [1,8]. But looking at the training examples, this may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the output is the maximum element when there are no palindromic rows, but in the test input, there is row4 as a palindrome, so output would be the first two elements of row4: [1,8]. But example2 has a row that is all 5s (row2) and outputs [5,5] and [5,2]. So perhaps when there are palindromic rows and others, the output includes other elements.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Let's try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nAnother Idea: The output rows are the first two elements of the rows that have the most occurrences of a particular element. For example, in example0's row1 is all 1s (5 occurrences), which is the maximum for that row. So output [1,1]. Then row0 has three 2s and two 1s, so most frequent is 2. But the first two elements are [2,1]. So this may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the first two elements of the rows that have the highest sum. In example0, row1 sum is 5, row0 sum is 8 (2+1+2+1+2=8). So highest sum is row0. But output includes row1 first. So no.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's look at the positions of the output elements in the input matrix. For example0's output, [1,1] is from row1, columns0-1. [2,1] from row0, columns0-1. In example1, the output is [8], which is the first element of row0. In example2's output, [5,5] is from row2, columns0-1, and [5,2] could be from row5, columns2-3 (5 and5?), but no. Alternatively, row3: [2,2,5,2,2,5,2]. Columns4-5 are 5,2. So [5,2]. So maybe for example2's output, the first row is from the all-same row's first two, and the second row is from a different row's specific positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nPerhaps the output is formed by taking the first two elements of each row that has the maximum occurrence of a certain element. For example, in example0:\n\nRow0: 2 appears three times, 1 two times.\n\nRow1: all 1s.\n\nRow2: same as row0.\n\nRow3: three 0s, two 1s.\n\nRow4: two 0s, two 2s, one 1.\n\nSo the rows with the highest occurrences are row1 (all 1s), row0 and 2 (three 2s), row3 (three 0s), etc. The output takes the first two elements of the rows with the highest occurrence. But example0's output is [1,1] and [2,1], which are from row1 and row0. So that fits.\n\nExample1's input:\n\nEach row has two 8s and two6s (except row0 has one 8, two6s, one0). So the row with the most 8s is row0 (1), row1 (two), row2 (two), row3 (two). The maximum is two 8s. So the output is [8], which could be the first element of the rows with two 8s. But example1's output is [8], which is the first element of row0, which has one 8. Not sure.\n\nHmm. Not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without finding a clear pattern, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example0's output, the first output row [1,1] comes from row1's first two elements. The second output row [2,1] comes from row0's first two elements. Row0 and row2 are the same, but only appear once in the output.\n\nIn example1's output, [8] is the first element of row0. But in example1's input, all rows start with 8,6,8,6. So the first elements alternate between 8 and6. The output is [8], which is the first element of the first row. Not sure.\n\nIn example2's output, [5,5] is the first two elements of row2 (all 5s). The second output row [5,2] is from row3's third and fourth elements (5,2?), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, example2's output may be formed by the elements where the row has a peak in the middle. For example, row2 is all 5s. The other rows have 5 in the middle. For example, row0's middle element is5. So the output is taking the elements around the middle.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Given that time is limited, I'll try to hypothesize that the output is formed by the first two elements of each row that is a palindrome. In example0, rows0,1,2 are palindromes. The output takes their first two elements but unique ones. So [1,1] from row1 and [2,1] from row0/2. For example1, there are no palindromes, so output is the maximum element across all rows. For example2, row2 is a palindrome (all 5s), so output [5,5], and another row which is a palindrome (maybe row4 or row3, but not sure).\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow4 is a palindrome: [1,8,8,1,8,8,1]. So its first two elements are [1,8]. Other rows: check if any are palindromes. Row0: no. Row1: no. Row2: no. Row3: no. Row5: no. Row6: no. So only row4 is a palindrome. So output would be [1,8]. But example1 has no palindromes and output is [8]. So according to this, the test input's output is [1,8]. But looking at the training examples, this may not fit. For example, example2's output has two rows, which would correspond to two palindromic rows. But earlier analysis shows that example2 has only row2 as a palindrome. So this approach may not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first two elements of the rows that are the same when reversed. For example0, rows0,1,2. Their first two elements are [2,1], [1,1], [2,1]. Unique ones are [2,1], [1,1]. So sorted as [1,1], [2,1]. For example1, no such rows, so output is the maximum element. For example2, row2 is a palindrome, first two [5,5]. Another row that is a palindrome: perhaps none. But output has two rows. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the first two elements of the rows that start and end with the same element. For example0's rows0,1,2 start and end with same elements. So their first two elements are taken. In example1, none of the rows start and end with same element, so output is the maximum element. In example2, row2 starts and ends with5, rows0,1,3,4 start and end with2. So their first two elements are [2,2] and [5,5]. But example2's output is [5,5] and [5,2], which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first two elements of the longest sequence of the same element in each row. For example0's row1: all 1s. Longest sequence is 5, so take first two. For row0: 2,1,2,1,2. The longest sequence is 1 (each element appears alternately). So the first two elements are 2,1. So output is [1,1], [2,1]. For example1's rows, the longest sequence might be 8 in some rows. But output is [8], which is the first element of row0.\n\nThis is not leading to a solution. I'm going to have to make a guess.\n\nAnother Idea: The output is formed by the elements that are in the positions where the column has a certain property. For example, columns where all elements are the same. Let's check example0's columns:\n\nNone of the columns are all the same. So this can't be.\n\nExample1's columns:\n\nNone are all the same. Output is [8]. So this is not it.\n\nExample2's columns:\n\nColumn2 in example2 is all5 (rows0-4 have5, row5 has5, row6 has5). So column2 is all5. The output's first row is [5,5], which could be from row2's column2 and 3 (both5). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if a column is all the same, then take elements from that column. But example2's output has [5,5] and [5,2]. Maybe the first output row is from column2 (all5), and the second from another column. But not sure.\n\nFinally, I'll consider that the pattern is to take the first two elements of the rows that are mirrors (palindromic), and if none, take the maximum element. So for the test input:\n\nOnly row4 is a palindrome. Its first two elements are [1,8]. So the output would be [1,8]. But how does this fit with example2's output. example2's row2 is all5s (a palindrome), so first two elements [5,5]. Then, example2's output has another row [5,2]. Perhaps there's another row that is a palindrome. But in example2's input, rows0,1,3,4 are [2,2,5,2,2,5,2], which are not palindromes. So this doesn't fit. Hence, this approach is invalid.\n\nAfter much deliberation, I'll make an educated guess that the output is the first two elements of each row that starts and ends with the same element. In example0, rows0,1,2 do. Their first two elements are [2,1], [1,1], [2,1]. Output unique ones sorted: [1,1], [2,1]. Example1 has no such rows, so output is the maximum element. Example2's rows0,1,3,4 start and end with2, row2 starts and ends with5. So their first two elements are [2,2], [2,2], [5,5], [2,2]. Unique are [2,2], [5,5]. But example2's output is [5,5] and [5,2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed to provide the answer based on the test input and the examples, even if the pattern isn't fully clear.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to take these input arrays and generate the output arrays based on some hidden rule. Let's look at the training examples to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 5x5 grid. The output has two arrays: [1,1] and [2,1]. Hmm. Let me look at the input rows. The first row is [2,1,2,1,2]. The output's first element is [1,1]. Maybe it's taking certain elements from each row? Let me check the positions. The output arrays have two elements each, maybe the middle elements or something?\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the first array is [1,1], which could correspond to the third row [2,1,2,1,2], but I don't see how. Alternatively, maybe looking at columns. The first output array's elements are 1 and 1. Looking at the columns, perhaps the second and third columns? Let me check. For example, the first column in the input is 2,1,2,0,0. The second column is 1,1,1,0,0. The third is 2,1,2,1,2. Hmm, maybe the output is related to the last two rows? Because the last two rows start with 0s. The output arrays are [1,1] and [2,1]. The fourth row is [0,0,1,1,1], and the fifth is [0,0,2,1,2]. The third and fourth elements of these rows? Fourth row's third element is 1, fourth is 1. Fifth row's third is 2, fourth is 1. So taking elements 3 and 4 from the fourth and fifth rows? That would give [1,1] and [2,1], which matches the output. Oh, that could be it. So for rows that start with 0s (maybe the first two elements are 0), take the third and fourth elements as part of the output?\n\nLet's check Example 1. Input is four rows. The output is [8]. Let's see. The input rows are:\n[8,6,0,6],\n[6,8,6,8],\n[8,6,8,6],\n[6,8,6,8]\n\nThe output is [8]. If the pattern is to take elements from rows that start with 0s, but none of these rows start with 0. Alternatively, maybe rows where the first element is 8. Let's see: first row starts with 8. Third row starts with 8. What's the third element of those rows? First row's third element is 0, third row's third is 8. But the output is [8], which is a single element. Maybe rows that end with 6? The first row ends with 6, third row ends with 6. Taking the first element of those rows? First row's first is 8, third's first is 8. So combining those gives [8,8], but the output is [8]. Hmm, maybe only take the first occurrence? Or perhaps look at columns where all the elements are the same. Wait, the output is [8]. Let's check the columns. Each column:\n\nColumn 0: 8,6,8,6 \u2192 no.\nColumn 1:6,8,6,8 \u2192 no.\nColumn 2:0,6,8,6 \u2192 no.\nColumn 3:6,8,6,8 \u2192 no. None of the columns have all the same elements. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the elements that are in the same position as the first occurrence of a 0 in the rows. Let's see. In the first row, there's a 0 at index 2. So for that row, maybe take the element after 0? The next element is 6. But the output is [8]. Maybe it's the element before the 0? The element before index 2 (0) is 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 1's output, the output is [8]. Let's see if the rows have any pattern that when combined, result in 8. For instance, the first row has 8 as the first element. The third row's third element is 8. But how does that lead to [8]? Maybe the middle rows. Wait, the input is a 4x4 grid. The output is a single element. Maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the middle of the grid. For example, the center of a 4x4 grid would be between elements, but perhaps taking the element that's in a certain position. Alternatively, maybe rows where the sum is even, but not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input is a 7x7 grid. Output is two arrays: [5,5] and [5,2]. Let's see. The input's last two rows are [5,5,5,5,5,0,0] and [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. Wait, the output arrays have two elements each. If following the same logic as Example 0, perhaps rows that start with 5 and then 2. Wait, the fifth row starts with 5,5,5,... but the output is [5,5]. The sixth row starts with 2,2,... and the output is [5,2]. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe rows that have a certain number of a specific element. The fifth row (index 5) is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. The output's first array is [5,5]. Maybe taking the third and fourth elements? Third is 5, fourth is 5. The sixth row is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. Third element is 5, fourth is 2. So outputting [5,2]. That would explain the output. So, perhaps the pattern is: for each row that ends with 0, take the third and fourth elements and output them as arrays. But wait, in Example 0, the last two rows end with 0,0? Wait, the fourth row in Example 0 is [0,0,1,1,1], which ends with 1s, but the fifth row is [0,0,2,1,2]. So maybe not ending with zeros. Alternatively, rows that have a certain number of zeros. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the last two rows start with two zeros. For those rows, take the third and fourth elements. The fourth row's third element is 1, fourth is 1 \u2192 [1,1]. Fifth row's third is 2, fourth is 1 \u2192 [2,1]. That's the output. So the pattern could be: for each row that starts with two zeros, take the third and fourth elements and put them in the output arrays.\n\nIn Example 1, the input rows are:\n\n[8,6,0,6],\n[6,8,6,8],\n[8,6,8,6],\n[6,8,6,8]\n\nNone of these rows start with two zeros. So perhaps there's another pattern here. The output is [8]. Let's see. The input has four rows, maybe looking for rows that have a certain property. For example, rows that start with 8 and 6 alternately. The first row starts with 8, second with 6, third with 8, fourth with 6. The output is [8]. Maybe the first element of the first row? But why not others. Alternatively, maybe columns that have the same value. Let me check the columns again. Column 0: 8,6,8,6. Column 1:6,8,6,8. Column 2:0,6,8,6. Column 3:6,8,6,8. The first two columns alternate between 8 and 6. The third column starts with 0. The fourth column alternates between 6 and 8. So maybe looking for columns that have all the same elements. None. But the output is [8], which is a single element. Maybe the maximum value in the grid. The grid has 8s and 6s and 0s. The maximum is 8, so output [8]. But why in Example 0, the output is two arrays. Hmm. Alternatively, the output could be the elements that are in the position where a row starts with a certain number. For Example 1, perhaps the first row starts with 8, and in that row, the first element is 8. But the output is [8]. But why only that? Or maybe the rows where the first element is equal to the last. Let's check. First row: 8 and 6 \u2192 not equal. Second row: 6 and 8 \u2192 no. Third row:8 and6\u2192 no. Fourth row:6 and8\u2192 no. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the outputs, in Example 0, the output arrays are two elements each, and there are two arrays. Example 1's output is one element. Example 2's output has two arrays. So perhaps the number of output arrays corresponds to the number of rows that meet a certain condition.\n\nIn Example 0, the last two rows start with 0,0, so two rows \u2192 two output arrays. In Example 2, the last two rows (index 5 and 6) have their last two elements as 0,0. Let's check. The fifth row is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0], and the sixth is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0]. So each of these rows ends with two zeros. Then the output is two arrays. For each such row, take the third and fourth elements. Fifth row's third and fourth are 5 and 5 \u2192 [5,5]. Sixth row's third and fourth are 5 and 2 \u2192 [5,2]. That matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern could be: for each row that ends with two zeros, take the third and fourth elements and output them as arrays. Wait, but in Example 0, the rows that start with two zeros are being considered. Let me check. Example 0's last two rows start with two zeros, and their outputs are the third and fourth elements. But in Example 2, the last two rows end with two zeros. Hmm, maybe the condition is that the row has two zeros at the end. Let's confirm:\n\nExample 0: The fourth row is [0,0,1,1,1] \u2192 ends with three 1s, not zeros. Fifth row is [0,0,2,1,2] \u2192 ends with 1 and 2. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the condition is rows that start with two zeros. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, fourth row starts with 0,0. Fifth row starts with 0,0. So two rows, output two arrays. Taking their third and fourth elements (indexes 2 and 3 if we start from 0). Fourth row's elements 2 and 3 are 1 and 1 \u2192 [1,1]. Fifth row's are 2 and 1 \u2192 [2,1]. So that matches.\n\nIn Example 1, there are no rows starting with two zeros. So how do we get the output [8]? Let's look again. The input rows are:\n\nRow 0: [8,6,0,6]\nRow 1: [6,8,6,8]\nRow 2: [8,6,8,6]\nRow 3: [6,8,6,8]\n\nNo rows start with two zeros. So maybe another condition. The output is [8], which is a single element. Let's look for any pattern. Maybe the element that is surrounded by 6s. The first row has 8,6,0,6. The third element is 0. The third row is [8,6,8,6], so the third element is 8. But how does that relate to the output? Alternatively, the output could be the maximum value in the grid. The grid has 8s, so maximum is 8. But why is it a single element array?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the element that appears in the same position in all rows. For example, looking at each column:\n\nColumn 0: 8,6,8,6 \u2192 alternating 8 and 6.\nColumn 1:6,8,6,8 \u2192 same pattern.\nColumn 2:0,6,8,6 \u2192 0,6,8,6.\nColumn3:6,8,6,8 \u2192 same as column 1.\n\nNo column has all elements the same. However, the third column (index 2) has elements 0,6,8,6. So the maximum here is 8, but it's only in the third row. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the element that is present in the middle of the rows. Since each row has even length (4 elements), there's no exact middle. But maybe the second element. For example, row 0's second element is 6. Row 1's is 8. Row 2's is 6. Row3's is 8. So the elements are 6,8,6,8. The output is 8. Maybe the most frequent in these positions. 6 and 8 each appear twice. So perhaps that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the element that is present in the first row's third position, which is 0, but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, [8], perhaps it's the first element of the first row. The first row starts with 8, so output [8]. But why not take others? Because the other rows start with 6 and 8 alternately. But why only the first row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are in positions where all the rows have the same element. But in this case, there's no such position. All columns have varying elements.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is the element that is present in the diagonal. For a 4x4 grid, the diagonal would be 8 (row 0, col0), 8 (row1, col1), 8 (row2, col2), 8 (row3, col3)? Wait, row0 col0 is 8. Row1 col1 is8. Row2 col2 is8. Row3 col3 is8. So all diagonal elements are 8. So the output is [8]. That makes sense. So the pattern here is to take the diagonal elements if they're all the same. But in Example 1, the diagonal is 8,8,8,8 \u2192 all 8s, so output [8]. That fits. For Example 0, the input is 5x5. The diagonal elements would be 2 (row0), 1 (row1), 2 (row2), 0 (row3), 2 (row4). These are different, so maybe the output isn't from the diagonal. So that doesn't explain Example 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the output isn't derived from the diagonal. So maybe there are multiple patterns, depending on the input. That complicates things. So perhaps each example has a different pattern. But that's unlikely. The user says there's a single pattern across all examples. So I need to find a rule that applies to all.\n\nLet me re-examine all the examples again with a new angle.\n\nAnother approach: Look for the output arrays as parts of the input rows. For Example 0, the output arrays are [1,1] and [2,1]. Looking at the input rows, [0,0,1,1,1] has [1,1,1], but the output takes [1,1]. Then [0,0,2,1,2] has [2,1,2], output takes [2,1]. So maybe taking the third and fourth elements of those rows. The rows that start with two zeros. So the pattern is: For each row that starts with two zeros, output the third and fourth elements as a sublist.\n\nIn Example 1, there are no such rows, but the output is [8]. So perhaps when there are no rows starting with two zeros, we take the diagonal elements. But why would that be the case? Alternatively, maybe there's another condition.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the output is [8], which is the value present in all diagonal positions. Because in a 4x4 grid, the diagonal elements are 8,8,8,8. So the output is [8]. That's a possibility. So the pattern could be: if there are rows that start with two zeros, take their third and fourth elements as outputs. Otherwise, if all diagonal elements are the same, output that element. \n\nFor Example 2, the output is [5,5] and [5,2]. Let's check if those rows start with two zeros. The fifth row is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0] \u2192 starts with 5,5. The sixth row is [2,2,5,2,2,0,0] \u2192 starts with 2,2. So maybe the condition isn't two zeros. Wait, but the fifth and sixth rows end with two zeros. So in Example 2, the rows ending with two zeros are considered. For each such row, take the third and fourth elements. The fifth row's third element is 5 (index 2?), wait, let's index starting from 0. The fifth row is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0]. The third element is index 2:5, fourth is index 3:5. So output [5,5]. Sixth row's third element (index 2) is 5, fourth (index3) is 2. So [5,2]. So the pattern could be: for each row that ends with two zeros, take the third and fourth elements (indexes 2 and 3) and output them as arrays.\n\nIn Example 0, the last two rows are [0,0,1,1,1] and [0,0,2,1,2]. These rows end with three 1s and two 1,2. So they don't end with two zeros. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the condition varies. Wait, this is conflicting. So perhaps the pattern is different for different examples, which is unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that for rows that start or end with two zeros, take certain elements. But how to reconcile the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is: for rows that have a certain number of zeros in specific positions, and then take some elements from them. Let's see:\n\nExample 0: The rows that start with two zeros. Take third and fourth elements.\n\nExample 1: No such rows, so take diagonal elements if all are the same.\n\nExample 2: Rows that end with two zeros. Take third and fourth elements.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent. Maybe there's another way.\n\nAnother idea: The output arrays in the examples have elements that are part of a cross or a certain pattern in the input grid. For example, in Example 0, maybe the output is the center elements of certain crosses. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the minimal repeating units. For Example 1, the input rows alternate between starting with 8 and 6. The output is [8], which is the first element of the first row. But why?\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Example 0 and 2, the output arrays are formed by taking elements from rows that have zeros in their tails. But in Example 0, the rows start with zeros, not end. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is to look for rows that have a certain number of leading or trailing zeros and then extract elements from those rows.\n\nIn Example 0, the last two rows start with two zeros. Output their third and fourth elements.\n\nIn Example 2, the fifth and sixth rows end with two zeros. Output their third and fourth elements.\n\nIn Example 1, there are no rows with leading or trailing zeros, so check the diagonal. If all diagonal elements are the same, output that element.\n\nBut how do we generalize this? The rule would have multiple steps:\n\n1. Check for rows that start with two zeros. If any, take their third and fourth elements as output arrays.\n\n2. If no such rows, check for rows that end with two zeros. If any, take their third and fourth elements as output arrays.\n\n3. If neither, check if all diagonal elements are the same. If yes, output that element.\n\nBut this feels a bit arbitrary, but let's test against the examples.\n\nExample 0: Two rows start with two zeros \u2192 take third and fourth elements \u2192 output matches.\n\nExample 1: No rows start or end with two zeros. Check diagonal. Diagonal elements are all 8 \u2192 output [8].\n\nExample 2: Rows end with two zeros. Take third and fourth elements \u2192 output matches.\n\nIf this is the pattern, then applying it to the test input should work.\n\nNow, looking at the test input:\n\nTest input is seven rows:\n\nRow0: [8, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow1: [1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow2: [8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow3: [8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8]\n\nRow4: [1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1]\n\nRow5: [8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8]\n\nRow6: [8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8]\n\nFirst, check if any rows start with two zeros. Looking at the rows:\n\nRow0 starts with 8,1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow1 starts with 1,8 \u2192 no.\n\nRow2 starts with 8,8 \u2192 no.\n\nRow3 starts with 8,1 \u2192 no.\n\nRow4 starts with 1,8 \u2192 no.\n\nRow5 starts with 8,8 \u2192 no.\n\nRow6 starts with 8,1 \u2192 no.\n\nSo no rows start with two zeros. Next, check rows that end with two zeros. Looking at the rows:\n\nRow0 ends with 0,0,0 \u2192 three zeros. So the last two elements are zeros, but the third from the end is also zero. So the last two are zeros, but perhaps we need exactly two zeros at the end.\n\nRow0 ends with three zeros. So maybe rows that end with two zeros. Let's look for rows that have exactly two zeros at the end.\n\nRow0: ends with three zeros \u2192 no.\n\nRow1: ends with three zeros \u2192 no.\n\nRow2: ends with three zeros \u2192 no.\n\nRows3-6 end with 8,8; 8,1; 1,8; 8,8. So no zeros.\n\nSo no rows end with two zeros. So step 3: check if all diagonal elements are the same.\n\nThe grid is 7x7. Diagonal elements are:\n\nRow0, col0:8\n\nRow1, col1:8\n\nRow2, col2:1\n\nRow3, col3:8\n\nRow4, col4:8\n\nRow5, col5:1\n\nRow6, col6:8\n\nThe diagonal elements are 8,8,1,8,8,1,8. These are not all the same. So step 3 would not apply.\n\nSo the pattern might have another condition. Maybe when there are no rows meeting the previous conditions, look for something else.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the rows that have a certain number of a particular element. For example, the test input rows 0,1,2 end with three zeros, but the other rows don't. So perhaps for rows that end with three zeros, take certain elements. Let's see. For row0: [8,1,8,8,0,0,0]. Ends with three zeros. Take the third and fourth elements from the start (assuming 0-based). Third element is 8, fourth is8. So [8,8]. For row1: [1,8,8,1,0,0,0]. Third element 8, fourth 1 \u2192 [8,1]. Row2: [8,8,1,8,0,0,0]. Third 1, fourth 8 \u2192 [1,8]. But the output would then have three arrays. But looking at the training examples, outputs have the same number of arrays as the number of qualifying rows. For Example 0, two qualifying rows \u2192 two arrays. Example 2, two qualifying rows \u2192 two arrays. So if test input has three rows ending with three zeros, the output would have three arrays. But I'm not sure if this is the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe rows that end with at least two zeros. So rows 0,1,2 end with three zeros. Then take third and fourth elements. So row0: 8 and8 \u2192 [8,8]. Row1:8 and1 \u2192 [8,1]. Row2:1 and8 \u2192 [1,8]. So the output would have three arrays. But looking at the training examples, when the rows have two zeros at the end, they take third and fourth. But in test input, rows end with three zeros. Maybe the same rule applies: take third and fourth elements. So output for test input would be three arrays: [8,8], [8,1], [1,8]. But the example outputs in training don't have such elements, so I'm not sure.\n\nBut wait, the training examples might have different rules. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows that have the maximum number of trailing zeros. For example, in the test input, rows 0,1,2 have three trailing zeros. The others have none. So perhaps these three rows are considered. For each, take the third and fourth elements. So:\n\nRow0: elements 2 and 3 \u2192 8 and8 \u2192 [8,8]\n\nRow1: elements 2 and3 \u21928 and1 \u2192 [8,1]\n\nRow2: elements 2 and3 \u21921 and8 \u2192 [1,8]\n\nThen output these three arrays. But looking at the training examples, the outputs are ordered based on the qualifying rows' positions. But this would lead to three output arrays, but in the training examples, when there are multiple qualifying rows, they are each output as separate arrays.\n\nBut the test input's expected output is not known. But according to the pattern from the training examples, the output should be arrays for each qualifying row.\n\nBut the problem is that in Example 1, there were no rows with leading/trailing zeros, so the output was the diagonal element. But in the test case, if there are no qualifying rows, maybe the diagonal elements are considered. But in this case, the diagonal elements are not all the same. So perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to look for rows where the first and last elements are the same. Let's check:\n\nExample0's rows:\n\nRow0: first 2, last 2 \u2192 same \u2192 output [1,1] and [2,1]. Not sure.\n\nExample1's rows:\n\nRow0:8 and6 \u2192 not same. Row1:6 and8 \u2192 no. Row2:8 and6 \u2192 no. Row3:6 and8 \u2192 no. So output [8], which is the diagonal.\n\nSo perhaps this isn't the case.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the test input, perhaps the rows that have 8 and 1 in alternating patterns. For example, rows 3,4,5,6. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the elements where the row contains a certain pattern. For example, in the test input, the first three rows end with three zeros. The fourth to sixth rows have more varied elements. Maybe the output is formed by taking the third and fourth elements of the first three rows. So:\n\nRow0:8,8 \u2192 [8,8]\n\nRow1:8,1 \u2192 [8,1]\n\nRow2:1,8 \u2192 [1,8]\n\nThen output those three arrays. But the training examples don't have this, but in Example 0 and 2, they took rows with certain zero patterns and output their third and fourth elements. Maybe in the test case, the qualifying rows are those ending with three zeros, but the pattern is to take third and fourth elements. But how does that fit with the training examples?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the qualifying rows were those starting with two zeros, and the output was their third and fourth elements. In Example 2, the qualifying rows ended with two zeros, and output their third and fourth elements. So the pattern is: for rows that have a leading or trailing run of two zeros, take third and fourth elements. But then in the test case, rows ending with three zeros may qualify as having at least two zeros, so we take their third and fourth elements.\n\nIf that's the case, then in the test input, the first three rows end with three zeros, which is more than two. So they qualify. For each such row, take third and fourth elements. So:\n\nRow0: elements at indices 2 and3 \u2192 8 and8 \u2192 [8,8]\n\nRow1: indices2 and3 \u21928 and1 \u2192 [8,1]\n\nRow2: indices2 and3 \u21921 and8 \u2192 [1,8]\n\nThus, the output would be three arrays. But looking back at the training examples, the outputs are presented as separate lines. For example, Example2's output is two arrays. So for the test input, the expected output would be three arrays. But I'm not sure if this aligns with the training examples. However, in Example 0 and 2, when there are qualifying rows (starting or ending with two zeros), their third and fourth elements are output. So the test case's first three rows have at least two trailing zeros, so their third and fourth elements should be output. \n\nBut the problem is that in the test input's first three rows, the trailing zeros are three, but the pattern is \"at least two\". So this would be valid.\n\nThus, the test output would be:\n\n[8,8]\n\n[8,1]\n\n[1,8]\n\nBut the user's examples have outputs with elements like [5,5] and [5,2] in Example2, which are third and fourth elements of rows ending with two zeros.\n\nSo applying that logic to the test input, the output should be the third and fourth elements of each row that has at least two trailing zeros.\n\nIn the test input, rows 0,1,2 have three trailing zeros, so they qualify. For each of those rows:\n\nRow0: elements at index 2 and3 \u2192 8,8 \u2192 [8,8]\n\nRow1: elements at index 2 and3 \u21928,1 \u2192 [8,1]\n\nRow2: elements at index 2 and3 \u21921,8 \u2192 [1,8]\n\nSo the output should have three arrays. However, the training examples sometimes have outputs like Example0's two arrays and Example2's two arrays. So the number of arrays depends on the number of qualifying rows.\n\nBut why in Example1, there were no qualifying rows (no leading/trailing two zeros), so output was [8], which is the diagonal. So the test case's output would be three arrays from the first three rows. But I need to verify this.\n\nAnother possibility is that the test input's qualifying rows are the first three, so output their third and fourth elements as arrays. So the final answer would be:\n\n[8,8]\n\n[8,1]\n\n[1,8]\n\nBut I need to check if there's another possible pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to look for rows where the sum of certain elements meets a condition. But this seems less likely.\n\nIn the absence of any other clear pattern, I'll proceed with the assumption that the pattern is: for each row that has at least two trailing zeros, take the third and fourth elements (0-based indices 2 and3) and output them as arrays. If no such rows exist, check if all diagonal elements are the same and output that. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRows 0,1,2 have three trailing zeros. So output their third and fourth elements:\n\nRow0: [8,8] \u2192 indices 2 and3 are 8 and8.\n\nRow1: [8,1] \u2192 indices 2 and3 are8 and1.\n\nRow2: [1,8] \u2192 indices2 and3 are1 and8.\n\nThus, the output would be three arrays. But looking at the training examples, the outputs are presented as separate lines. So the test output would be:\n\n[8,8]\n\n[8,1]\n\n[1,8]\n\nBut the training examples also have outputs that sometimes have the same elements as in the third and fourth positions. For example, Example2's output [5,5] comes from row5's third and fourth elements (5 and5), which are at indices2 and3. That matches.\n\nSo this seems to fit. Therefore, the test input's output would be the three arrays as computed.",
