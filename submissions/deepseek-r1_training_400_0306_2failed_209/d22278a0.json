        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a grid where the first row has some non-zero numbers, and then the output seems to spread those numbers in a certain way. Let me look closer.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has [1, 0, 0, ..., 2] in the first row. The output starts with [1,0,1,0,1,2,0,2,0,2]. Hmm. It looks like the 1 and 2 are alternating, but maybe expanding outward? Also, the output grid has some layers. For instance, the first row alternates 1 and 0 up to the 2, then alternates 2 and 0. Then in subsequent rows, there's a pattern of 1s and 2s spreading down. Maybe each non-zero number in the first row creates a kind of wave or ripple effect downwards, increasing their spread each row?\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has 3 in the first row's last element and 8 in the last row's first. The output has a lot of 3s and 8s spreading. The first row of the output starts with 0,3,0,3... So maybe the non-zero elements from the input's first and last rows are creating alternating patterns. Also, when there's a non-zero in the last row (like 8 in Example 1's last row), it affects the lower part of the output. So perhaps the first row's non-zero elements create a top-down pattern, and the last row's elements create a bottom-up pattern, and they interact somehow.\n\nIn Example 2, the first row starts with 2 and the last row has 4. The output shows 2s spreading from the top and 4s from the bottom. So maybe each non-zero in the first row propagates downward, and each non-zero in the last row propagates upward. The way they spread is perhaps in a checkerboard or alternating pattern. For example, in Example 0's output, the 1s are in every other column starting from the left, and the 2s start from the right. Similarly, in Example 1, the 3s are on the right side, alternating, and the 8s on the left.\n\nWait, maybe it's that the first element in the first row (like 1 in Example 0, 3 in Example1, 2 in Example2, 1 in Example3) starts a pattern that alternates columns as you go down, expanding each row. Similarly, the last element in the first row (like 2 in Example0, 3 in Example1, etc.) does the same from the right. Then, the elements in the last row (like 8 in Example1 and 4 in Example2) do a similar thing but starting from the bottom, maybe moving upwards with their own patterns.\n\nLooking at the Test Input: the first row starts with 4, and the last row starts with 8 and ends with 1. So maybe the 4 will spread downward from the top left, the 8 from the bottom left, and 1 from the bottom right? But the last row of the test input is [8,0,...,1]. Wait, the first element is 8 and the last is 1. So in the output, these might generate two patterns: 8 moving up from the bottom left, and 1 moving up from the bottom right. The 4 from the top left would move down.\n\nLet's think about how the spreading works. For each non-zero in the first row, maybe the pattern is that in each subsequent row, the number spreads to the next column, alternating left and right. For example, in Example0, the 1 in the first position of the first row leads to in row 0: 1,0,1,0,1... then in row 2, more 1s. Similarly, the 2 at the end leads to 2s starting from the right. So maybe each non-zero in the first row creates a \"V\" shape spreading down, expanding left and right alternately each row. And similarly, non-zero in the last row create an inverted \"V\" moving up.\n\nAnother observation: in Example3, the input is a 7x7 grid. The first row has 1 and 2 at the ends. The output shows 1s spreading down on the left and 2s on the right. The last row has 8, which in the output creates 8s moving up. So maybe the direction is based on the row position. Elements in the first row propagate downward, while elements in the last row propagate upward.\n\nWait, in Example1's input, the last row has 8 in the first position. The output's last row starts with 8, then in the rows above, there are 8s moving up, alternating columns. Similarly, in Example2, the last row's first element is 4, and in the output, the 4s start from the bottom and move up.\n\nSo the general rule could be:\n\n1. For each non-zero element in the first row, create a pattern that spreads downward, alternating columns in a checkerboard fashion, expanding each row. The initial element's position determines the starting side. For example, if the element is at position 0 (leftmost), then in each subsequent row, the spread alternates to the right. Similarly, if it's at the right end (like position 9 in Example0), the spread alternates to the left.\n\n2. For each non-zero element in the last row, create a similar pattern but moving upward. So starting from the bottom, each row above alternates the columns.\n\nAdditionally, when two patterns meet, their values might overwrite each other based on some priority, like the bottom-up patterns take precedence or vice versa. Or maybe they combine, but in the examples, the outputs have separate regions for each number.\n\nLooking at Example1's output: the first row has 3s (from the first row's 3), and the lower rows have 8s (from the last row's 8). They meet in the middle but don't interfere. So perhaps the top-down and bottom-up patterns are layered, and when they overlap, the value from the dominant pattern (maybe the bottom-up) takes over. Or maybe the order in which they are processed.\n\nNow, let's check how the numbers expand. For example, in Example0's output, the first row's 1 and 2 start their spread. The first row after the input's first row (output row 0) is [1,0,1,0,1,2,0,2,0,2]. So the 1 is expanding to the right, every other column. Then, in the next row (output row1), [0,0,1,0,1,2,0,2,0,0]. The 1s are in columns 2 and 4. Wait, that's different. Maybe it's that each row below adds a layer where the 1s spread to adjacent columns alternately. Alternatively, maybe each row i has the 1s in columns where the distance from the original position is less than or equal to the row index, but in an alternating fashion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row, starting from the top, the non-zero values from the first row spread down and to the sides in a diamond or triangular pattern. For example, the first non-zero (say, value V at column c) in the first row creates a pattern where, for each row r below, columns c \u00b1 r (if within bounds) are set to V, but alternated in some way. But the examples don't exactly show that. For example, in Example0, the first row has 1 in column 0. The output's row 0 (same as input's first row) has 1s in 0, 2, 4. Then row1 has 1s in 2,4. Row2 has 1s in 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, that's not a simple diamond. Maybe it's more like a checkerboard pattern where each subsequent row alternates the spread.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be similar to a cellular automaton, where each cell's value is determined by the cells above and possibly adjacent. But it's unclear.\n\nAnother approach: look for the output rows. For Example0's output:\n\nRow0: [1,0,1,0,1,2,0,2,0,2] \u2192 starts with 1s and then 2s. The 1s are in even indices (0,2,4) up to position4, then 2s from position5 (even positions 5,7,9? Wait 5 is odd. Hmm. Position5 is 2, then 7,9. So 5,7,9. Oh, perhaps the 2s start from position5 (index5, which is even in 0-based) and then every other. Wait, the original input's first row has 2 at index9. So maybe the 2 starts from position9 and spreads leftwards, but in the output's first row, they are at 5,7,9. So perhaps the 2s spread leftwards, every other column, starting from the original position.\n\nBut how? Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, the first row input has 1 at position0 and 2 at position9.\n\nIn the output's first row (same as input's first row?), the 1s are at 0,2,4 and 2s at 5,7,9. So the 1s spread to the right every other column, starting at 0, and the 2s spread to the left every other column starting at9. So for each row, the spread of each number is that they occupy columns that are even steps away from their origin, but alternating.\n\nAlternatively, for the top-down patterns: starting from the first row's elements, for each subsequent row, the coverage expands by one column to the left and right, but only in even steps. For example, in row0 (original input's row0), the 1 is at 0. Then in the output's row0, the 1s are 0,2,4 (so expanding 0, then adding +2 each step). Then row1 (output's row1) would have 2,4 (maybe expanding in a different way). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the numbers in the first row creating a \"wave\" that spreads down, covering more columns each row. For example, the 1 starts at column0. In row0, it's at 0. In row1 (the next row down), it's at columns0\u00b11? But the output's row1 in Example0 has 1s at columns2 and4. Maybe the spread is that each row adds a layer where the number alternates columns. For example, the first row (output row0) for 1 is columns0,2,4. Then next row (output row1) is columns2,4. Then output row2 is columns0,1,2,3,4. Wait, that's in Example0's output:\n\nRow0: 1 at 0,2,4.\n\nRow1: 1 at 2,4.\n\nRow2: 1 at 0,1,2,3,4 (columns 0-4, but alternating? No, in row2, the 1s are [1,1,1,0,1, ...]. Wait, row2 is [1,1,1,0,1,2,0,2,2,2]. So columns0-2 and 4.\n\nHmm, maybe the pattern is more about creating triangles. For example, the 1s form a triangle starting from column0, expanding to the right and down. But the exact pattern is not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the positions of the non-zero elements in the output rows, perhaps the numbers are placed in a way that alternates between even and odd columns in subsequent rows. For example, in the first row after the input's first row (output row0 in Example0), the 1s are in even columns (0,2,4) and 2s in odd columns (5,7,9). Then the next row (output row1) has 1s in column2 (even) and 4 (even), 2s in column5 (even?) Wait, no. Column5 is even index (since indexes start at 0). Wait, 5 is odd (0-based, 0,1,2,3,4,5: 5 is 5th index, which is odd). Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: look at how the output rows are built for each example. For instance, in Example0:\n\nThe output starts with the first row modified to have 1 and 2 alternated. Then each subsequent row seems to expand the 1s and 2s in a certain pattern, maybe following some rules based on the row's parity. For example, even rows (0,2,4, etc.) have more 1s, while odd rows have fewer? Not exactly. Looking at row2 (third row in output), it has [1,1,1,0,1,2,0,2,2,2]. So 1s are in columns0-2 and 4. 2s are in 5,7-9. Then row4 (fifth row) has all 1s up to column4 and 2s from column5. Wait, row4 is [1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2]. So after row4, the 1s take the left half and 2s the right. Then rows below start repeating this pattern but alternating with all zeros. Like row5 is all zeros. Then row6 repeats row4's pattern, and so on.\n\nWait, in Example0, rows4,6,8 are [1,1...,2,2...], and rows5,7,9 are zeros. So perhaps after a certain point, the pattern becomes fixed. But how does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be generated by two separate processes: one for each non-zero in the first row, creating expanding regions, and then when they meet, they form a boundary. For example, the 1 and 2 in Example0's first row spread towards the center, and once they meet, they form a split. Then subsequent rows alternate between being filled with the left or right value. But this is speculative.\n\nLooking at the Test Input, the first row starts with 4, and the last row starts with 8 and ends with 1. So maybe the output will have 4 spreading down from the top left, 8 spreading up from the bottom left, and 1 spreading up from the bottom right. Then these will create patterns that interact.\n\nFor the Test Input's output, the first row (input's first row is [4,0,...0]). So the output's first row would have 4 spreading to the right in every other column. The last row's 8 and 1 would start spreading upward. The 8 would spread to the right from the leftmost column, and the 1 would spread to the left from the rightmost column.\n\nBut how to determine the exact pattern. Let's look at Example3's input. The first row has [1,0,0,0,0,0,2], and the last row has [8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output's first row is [1,0,1,0,2,0,2]. So 1 is in positions0,2 and 2 in positions4,6. Then in the next row, [0,0,1,0,2,0,0], 1 is in position2 and 2 in4. Then row2 has [1,1,1,0,2,2,2]. So 1 takes positions0-2 and 2 takes4-6. Then row4 (input's row4) is [8,8,8,0,0,2,2], so 8 is spreading from the bottom left (original position0 in last row) upward. So row4 in the output is three 8s, then 0s, then 2s.\n\nThis suggests that the bottom-up patterns start from the last row's elements. So for example, 8 in the last row's position0 will create a pattern moving upwards, filling columns to the right. In Example3's output, row4 (which is 3 rows above the last) has 8s in columns0-2, then 0s, then 2s from the top's 2.\n\nPutting this together, perhaps the algorithm is:\n\nFor each non-zero element in the first row (top row):\n\n- Starting from the element's column, spread downward, filling every other column in each row, expanding left and right as you go down.\n\nFor each non-zero element in the last row (bottom row):\n\n- Starting from the element's column, spread upward, filling every other column in each row, expanding left and right as you go up.\n\nWhen two patterns overlap, the later one (maybe bottom-up) takes precedence.\n\nIn the Test Input, the first row has 4 at column0. So it spreads downward, filling even columns (0,2,4,...) each row. The last row has 8 at column0 and 1 at column16 (since it's a 17-element row). So 8 spreads upward, filling columns to the right (even?), and 1 spreads upward from column16, filling columns to the left (even steps?).\n\nLet's try to model this. For the Test Input:\n\nFirst row: [4,0,...]. So 4 starts at column0. Each row below would expand to the right and left. Let's say in row0 (top), 4 is at 0. In row1, maybe 0,2. Row2, 0,2,4. Etc. But how does this align with the examples?\n\nIn Example0's first row's 1 at column0: output row0 (same as input row0) has 1 at 0,2,4. Then row1 has 2,4. So maybe the expansion is to the right by 2 columns each row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 1s in each row increases as the row index increases. For example, row0 (index0) has 1 at 0,2,4. Row1 (index1) has at 2,4. Row2 (index2) has 0,1,2,3,4. Hmm, no. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that in each row, the coverage is determined by the row's index. For instance, for a top-down element:\n\nThe columns covered are the original column \u00b1 row index, but adjusted to step by 2. For example, row r would cover columns c - r, c - r + 2, ... up to c + r, but only even steps. So for row0 (r=0), it's just c. Then for r=1, c-1 and c+1, but since that's odd, maybe not. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, in each row, the number of columns covered increases by 2 each row. For example, row0:1 column, row1:3 columns, row2:5 columns, etc. But in Example0's output, row0 has 1s at columns 0,2,4 (3 positions), row1 has 2 columns (2 and4), row2 has 5 columns (0,1,2,3,4). So that's inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that for top-down elements, the coverage in each row is determined by whether the row index is even or odd. Like, even rows spread more to the left and right, while odd rows contract. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by mirroring the input's first and last rows in a certain way and then applying a checkerboard pattern. For example, the first row's non-zero elements create a pattern that alternates columns as they go down, and similarly for the last row's elements going up.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe it's best to look for a pattern in the outputs and replicate it for the test input.\n\nLooking at the Test Input, it's a 17x17 grid. The first row has 4 at position0, and the last row has 8 at position0 and 1 at position16.\n\nSo following the examples, the output should have:\n\n- The 4 from the first row spreading downward, creating a pattern where each row below has 4s in even columns (0,2,4,...), expanding as you go down.\n\n- The 8 from the last row's position0 spreads upward, filling even columns (0,2,4,...) as you go up.\n\n- The 1 from the last row's position16 spreads upward, filling odd columns (15,13,...) since starting from the end.\n\nBut let's see how Example1's last row has 8 in position0. The output's last few rows show 8 spreading upward. In Example1's output, the last row's input is [8,0,0...0], and in the output, the last row is [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. The row above (row10) is [0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,3]. Wait, this seems to have 8s in even columns (0,2,4,6,8,10) for row11. Then row10 has 8s at 2,4,6,8. So it's like each upward row reduces the spread by two columns. So for the 8 starting at column0 in the last row, row11 (the last row's output) has 8 in even columns. Row10 (one up) has 8 starting at column2, then even columns. Row9 has 8 in columns4,6,8. Wait, maybe not. Let me look at Example1's output:\n\nThe last row (row11) is [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. Then row10: [0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,3]. So row10's 8s are in columns2,4,6,8. Row9: [8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. So columns0,1,2,4,6,8,10. Hmm, this is inconsistent. Maybe the pattern is that each upward row shifts the starting column by +1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each element in the last row, the upward spread creates a diamond shape. For instance, the element's column is the center, and each row up adds coverage to the left and right. For example, in Example1's last row's 8 in column0:\n\n- Row11 (original last row): covers column0.\n\n- Row10: covers columns0-1.\n\n- Row9: covers columns0-2.\n\n- Row8: covers columns0-3.\n\nBut in reality, in Example1's output:\n\nRow11: 8 at 0,2,4,6,8,10 (even columns).\n\nRow10: 8 at 2,4,6,8.\n\nRow9: 8 at 4,6,8, etc. Wait, this doesn't fit. So perhaps it's different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the upward spread for the last row's elements fills columns in a way that each row up alternates even and odd, but it's not clear.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n\n- The first row has 4 at column0. So the top-down pattern will start here. In Example0, the 1 at column0 spreads to even columns in each row below. Similarly, the 4 would spread to even columns (0,2,4,...) in each row as we go down.\n\n- The last row has 8 at column0 and 1 at column16. So the 8 would spread upward, filling even columns (0,2,4,...) from the bottom up, and the 1 would spread upward from column16, filling odd columns (15,13,...) as we move up.\n\nBut when these patterns meet, how do they interact? In Example1's output, the 3s from the top and 8s from the bottom meet in the middle. The rows where they meet have both patterns, but with one possibly overriding the other.\n\nSo for the Test Input's output:\n\n- The first few rows will be dominated by the 4 spreading down (even columns).\n\n- The middle rows might be a mix of 4s from the top and 8s and 1s from the bottom.\n\n- The lower rows will have 8s and 1s spreading upward.\n\nBut I need to model this precisely.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example2's output, where the first row's 2 spreads down and the last row's 4 spreads up, the output shows a clear division between the 2s and 4s. For example, rows0-6 have 2s, and rows7-12 have 4s. This suggests that the bottom-up patterns take precedence once they reach certain rows.\n\nIn Example2's input, the first row has 2, and the last row has 4. The output starts with 2s spreading down, then starting from row7 (0-based), the 4s appear and take over. This might be because the bottom-up pattern for 4 starts from row12 (last row) and moves up, eventually overlapping with the top-down 2s.\n\nSo for the Test Input, the 4 from the top will spread down, and the 8 and 1 from the bottom will spread up. The rows closer to the top will have 4s, and those closer to the bottom will have 8s and 1s.\n\nBut the exact pattern of how they spread needs to be determined.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0, the first row's 1 and 2 spread down. The output's rows alternate between having 1s and 2s in their respective halves. For instance, row4 is all 1s on the left and 2s on the right. Then row5 is all zeros. Row6 repeats row4's pattern. This suggests that after a certain depth, the patterns stabilize into alternating full rows.\n\nSimilarly, in the Test Input, after the 4 and 8/1 patterns meet, there might be alternating rows of their respective patterns.\n\nBut how to model this for a 17x17 grid?\n\nLet me attempt to sketch the Test Input's output.\n\nFirst row (input's row0): [4,0,0,...0]. Output row0: 4,0,4,0,4,... alternating even columns.\n\nThen row1: 0,0,4,0,4,... perhaps.\n\nBut looking at Example0's output, the first row (input's row0) is transformed into [1,0,1,0,1,2,0,2,0,2]. So the 1s are in even columns up to a point, and the 2s in odd columns starting from the end. So perhaps for the Test Input's first row, the 4 will spread to even columns (0,2,4,...), and the last element (which is 0) doesn't contribute. But in the Test Input's first row, only the first element is 4. So the output row0 would be [4,0,4,0,4,...] up to column16.\n\nThen for each subsequent row down, the 4s spread further. For example, row1 would have 4s in even columns, but maybe starting from column2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the spread could be such that each row down adds a new layer. For example, row0: 4 at column0.\n\nRow1: 4 at columns0 and 2.\n\nRow2: columns0,2,4.\n\nRow3: 0,2,4,6.\n\nAnd so on, until the entire left half is filled with 4s. Then, after a certain row, it starts filling the entire left half.\n\nBut in Example0's output, row4 (5th row) is all 1s on the left and 2s on the right. Maybe when the spread from the top and bottom meet, they split the grid into two halves.\n\nBut with the Test Input's bottom row having 8 and1, these would start spreading upward. The 8 is at column0, so it would spread upward filling even columns. The 1 is at column16 (the last column in a 17-element row), so it would spread upward filling odd columns (15,13, etc.) perhaps.\n\nPutting this all together, the Test Input's output would have:\n\n- Top half filled with 4s spreading down in even columns.\n\n- Bottom half filled with 8s (left side, even columns) and 1s (right side, odd columns) moving up.\n\n- Middle rows may have a mix or transition.\n\nBut to match the example outputs, the pattern seems to involve creating alternating regions where the numbers from the top and bottom take over entire rows in a staggered pattern.\n\nIn Example0's output, after row4, the rows alternate between full 1s and 2s then zeros. Similarly, in the Test Input, after a certain row, the pattern might stabilize into alternating full rows of 4s and then zeros, followed by rows of 8s and 1s from the bottom.\n\nBut this is quite vague. Given the time, I'll proceed to generate the output based on the following assumptions:\n\n1. Each non-zero in the first row spreads down, filling even columns (starting from their position) in each row. Each row adds more even columns.\n\n2. Each non-zero in the last row spreads up, filling even columns (for left elements) and odd columns (for right elements) in each row.\n\n3. When patterns meet, the bottom-up patterns take precedence.\n\nSo for the Test Input:\n\n- The top-down 4 starts at column0 and fills even columns (0,2,4,...) in each row below.\n\n- The bottom-up 8 starts at column0 and fills even columns (0,2,4,...) in each row above.\n\n- The bottom-up 1 starts at column16 and fills odd columns (15,13,11,...) in each row above.\n\nThe interaction between 4 and 8 would be that the 8's pattern overrides the 4's when they meet. Similarly, the 1's pattern would fill the right side.\n\nBut how do the rows look?\n\nFor the first few rows (0 to, say, 8):\n\nRow0: 4,0,4,0,4,... up to column16.\n\nRow1: 0,0,4,0,4,... \n\nRow2: 4,4,4,0,4,... \n\nAnd so on, expanding the 4s as in Example0.\n\nFor the bottom rows (16,15,14...):\n\nRow16 (original last row) is [8,0,...,1]. Output row16 would be 8,0,8,0,8,...1 (since 1 is at column16). But perhaps the 8 fills even columns, and 1 fills odd columns towards the end.\n\nRow15 (one up): 8,0,8,0,...1,0,1.\n\nRow14: 8,8,8,0,...0,1,1,1.\n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the output for the Test Input will alternate between 4s in the upper half and 8s and 1s in the lower half, with a transition in the middle. The exact pattern may require generating each row based on the row index and the original elements' positions.\n\nHowever, without a clear formula, it's challenging. But looking at the examples, especially Example2 and Example3, the final answer should follow a similar structure.\n\nIn Example2, the output has a section of 2s from the top and 4s from the bottom. Similarly, the Test Input's output will likely have sections with 4s, then 8s and 1s.\n\nAfter struggling, I'll try to generate the Test Input's output by applying the pattern from the examples, particularly Example1 and Example2, and assuming that the non-zero elements in the first and last rows spread downward and upward, respectively, filling even and odd columns.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a grid where most entries are zero except for a couple of numbers. The outputs seem to be transformed grids with more numbers filled in. Let's see the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has [1,0,...,2] in the first row. The output for that row becomes [1,0,1,0,1,2,0,2,0,2]. Hmm. Maybe the 1 and 2 are spreading outwards? Like, from the first element (1) and the last (2), they alternate in some way. The first row in the output alternates 1 and 0 until it hits the 2, then alternates 2 and 0. But how does that spread to other rows?\n\nLooking at the other rows in Example 0's output: The second row starts with 0, then 0, then 1... Maybe it's a kind of wave pattern expanding from the initial non-zero elements. The third row has more 1s and 2s. Also, notice that the first element is 1 and the last in the input is 2. Maybe the pattern propagates diagonally or in some direction.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 3 at the end of the first row and an 8 at the start of the last row. The output has 3s and 8s spreading. The first output row alternates 0 and 3. Then the next row starts with 8, and then 0s and 3s. The pattern seems to involve the numbers from the input (3 and 8) propagating through the grid, maybe bouncing off the edges or creating alternating patterns as they spread.\n\nAnother thing to notice is that the output grids have a lot of alternating numbers, and the non-zero entries from the input seem to generate expanding regions of their own number, possibly interacting where they meet. Like, in Example 0, 1 and 2 spread out, and where they meet, maybe they alternate. \n\nLooking at the structure of the output grids, there's a symmetry in how the numbers spread. For instance, in Example 2, the input has a 2 at the start and a 4 at the end of the last row. The output shows 2s and 4s spreading in a similar way, with alternating patterns. The rows alternate between filled regions of each number and zeros, possibly based on some distance from the source.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are expanding outward in a diamond or square pattern, with each layer adding more of the number. For example, in the first example, the 1 and 2 start at the ends and spread to adjacent cells, creating a checkerboard or alternating pattern. Each subsequent row might represent a step further from the source, with the numbers filling in every other cell.\n\nAlso, looking at the positions where the numbers are placed in the output, the rows might be generated based on the original positions. For instance, in Example 3, the input has 1 at the start of the first row and 2 at the end, and 8 at the start of the last row. The output rows for the first part have 1s and 2s interacting, while the lower rows have 8s and 2s. So the numbers are expanding downward and interacting with each other.\n\nAnother observation: The output rows might be generated by some rule that alternates the numbers based on their original positions. For example, the first row's output alternates starting with the first number, then alternates with the second number once it's encountered. The other rows could be combinations of the spread from both the top and bottom numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps each non-zero in the input is a seed, and the output is generated by expanding these seeds to the right and down, alternating between their own value and zero. But how do they interact when they meet?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero number in the input propagates diagonally. For instance, in Example 0, the 1 in the top-left starts spreading right and down, and the 2 in the top-right does the same. Each step, they alternate their value and zero. But when two different numbers meet, perhaps they combine or alternate.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers could be expanding in a way that creates a diamond shape. For example, the 1 in the first row starts at position 0, then in the next row, it affects the adjacent positions, creating a pattern that widens each row. Similarly, the 2 starts at the end and moves left, creating another diamond. Where they meet, maybe there's a collision and their values alternate.\n\nLooking at the first example's output rows:\n\nRow 0: [1,0,1,0,1,2,0,2,0,2] \u2013 starts with 1 and alternates, then switches to 2 after the middle.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,1,0,1,2,0,2,0,0] \u2013 starts later with 1 and ends earlier with 2.\n\nRow 2: [1,1,1,0,1,2,0,2,2,2] \u2013 more 1s and 2s spreading.\n\nThis suggests that the 1 is expanding downward and to the right, and the 2 is expanding downward and to the left, creating overlapping regions where their patterns combine.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each row in the output is generated based on the original input's non-zero elements, with their values expanding in a way that depends on the row's distance from the source. For example, in the first example, the 1 is in row 0, column 0, and the 2 is in row 0, column 9. Each subsequent row below could have their values spreading outward, with their presence determined by the distance.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the fifth row (index 4) is all 1s and 2s. Then it alternates with rows of zeros. Maybe the expansion is toggling on even and odd rows.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are expanding in a wave-like pattern where each step down alternates between filling the same positions as the previous row and shifting.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a cellular automaton. Each non-zero cell in the input acts as a seed, and each step (row) applies certain rules to generate the next row. For example, a cell in the next row could be the same as the cell above, or a combination of left and right neighbors, with the numbers propagating.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's try to find a rule.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. The output first row is [1,0,1,0,1,2,0,2,0,2]. It alternates 1 and 0 until the middle, then 2 and 0. The middle is between positions 4 and 5. The original 1 is at position 0 and 2 at position 9. The output row 0 alternates 1 starting from the left, and 2 starting from the right. So perhaps in row 0, each non-zero value starts to expand to the right (for 1) and to the left (for 2), filling every other position. Then, in each subsequent row, the expansion continues, but maybe with some direction.\n\nLooking at the output row 1 for Example 0: [0,0,1,0,1,2,0,2,0,0]. The 1s start at position 2 and 4, and 2s at 5 and 7. So compared to row 0, which had 1s at 0,2,4 and 2s at 5,7,9. So row 1's 1s are shifted right by 2 positions? Wait, row 0's 1s are 0,2,4. Row 1's are 2,4. So maybe it's moving downward and spreading. Similarly, the 2s in row 0 are 5,7,9. In row 1, they're 5,7. So perhaps each step down reduces the spread by one on each end, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each row is built by taking the previous row and shifting or expanding. But this might vary per example.\n\nAlternatively, the output grid might be constructed such that each non-zero in the input starts a pattern that alternates between their value and zero in subsequent rows and columns, creating a diamond shape. For instance, the 1 in row 0 column 0 would create a diamond where each row adds a layer of 1s, alternating with zeros. Similarly, the 2 in column 9 creates a diamond expanding left. Where they meet, they might alternate between 1 and 2.\n\nBut how to formalize this. Let's think about the 1 and 2 in Example 0. The output rows for 1:\n\nRow 0: 1 at positions 0,2,4. Then 2 at 5,7,9.\n\nRow 1: 1 at 2,4. 2 at 5,7.\n\nRow 2: 1 at 0-2,4. 2 at 5,7-9.\n\nHmm, maybe it's more complex. Alternatively, each non-zero number creates a pattern where each subsequent row has a \"staircase\" effect, expanding left and right but in a way that alternates.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each non-zero element in the input row, you create a triangle or pyramid shape where each row i has the number placed at positions (original position \u00b1 i) with some alternation.\n\nFor example, the 1 at position 0 in row 0. In row 1, it could be at positions 0 \u00b11, but since it's the first row, maybe 0+1=1? But in example 0's output row 0, the 1 is at 0,2,4... So perhaps the step is adding 2 each time. Wait, original position 0, then in row 0, it's 0, 2, 4, etc., but maybe it's based on the row index. Or maybe it's a diagonal expansion.\n\nAnother angle: Look at the positions of the non-zero numbers in the output and see their relation to the input. In Example 0, the input has 1 at (0,0) and 2 at (0,9). The output rows start with 1s and 2s that spread in such a way that they form alternating blocks. For instance, in row 4 (index 4), the entire row is filled with 1s up to the middle, then 2s. It's like the 1s and 2s are expanding downward and towards each other, filling the row alternately.\n\nLooking at the output rows in Example 0:\n\nRow 4: [1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2]. So, all positions 0-4 are 1, and 5-9 are 2. This suggests that by row 4, the 1 has spread to cover the first half and the 2 the second half. Then, rows below this start to decrease again. For example, row 5 is all zeros again. Then row 6 is filled with 1 and 2, but maybe in reverse?\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, after row 4 (all 1s and 2s), the next rows (5,6,7,8,9) alternate between all 1/2 and zeros. Like row 5 is zeros, row 6 is filled again, etc. So it's like a diamond shape expanding down and then contracting.\n\nSo perhaps each non-zero in the input generates a diamond-shaped region where the number fills the area, expanding with each row until a certain point, then contracting. If there are two numbers, their diamonds meet in the middle. Then, after the middle row, their regions contract again.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 1 and 2 in the first row. The output's middle row (row 4) is filled with 1s and 2s split in the middle. Then rows after that start to reduce. The pattern is symmetric around the middle row.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the input has 3 at the end of the first row and 8 at the start of the last row. The output's middle rows (like row 5 and 6) show the 3s and 8s expanding and interacting.\n\nIn Example 3's input, the numbers are 1, 2, and 8. The output has their regions expanding and overlapping.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that each non-zero number in the input creates a diamond-shaped region in the output. The diamond starts at the position of the number and expands downward, filling cells in a way that the width increases by 2 each row (spreading left and right) until the middle of the grid, then contracts.\n\nBut how exactly are the numbers filled in each row? Let's take Example 0 again. The first row (input) has 1 at (0,0) and 2 at (0,9). The output's row 0 is their expansion. Then each subsequent row expands the 1 and 2 regions until row 4, which is the middle. Then they contract.\n\nIn row 0, output is [1,0,1,0,1,2,0,2,0,2]. So for the 1 in column 0, the expansion starts at 0, then skips 1, fills 2, skips 3, fills 4. For the 2 in column 9, starts at 9, then 7, 5. They meet at position 5. Then in row 4, 1 fills up to 4 and 2 from 5 to 9. \n\nSo maybe each number expands left and right by one cell each row, but alternates filling with the number and zero. Or perhaps the expansion is such that each step, the number is placed at positions offset by the row index. For example, the 1 at (0,0) in row 0. In row i, the 1 would be placed at positions 0 + i*step, but this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that each number propagates downward and to the left and right, creating a diamond shape where the width at row i is 2i +1, centered at the original column. But the examples don't exactly match this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output grid as a mirror. The middle row is the mirror line, and each number's diamond expands to the middle and then reflects back. For instance, the 1 in Example 0's input starts at row 0, expands down to row 4 (middle of the 10-row grid?), then contracts back. The number of rows in Example 0's output is 10, so the middle would be between rows 4 and 5. Row 4 is filled with 1s and 2s, then row 5 is zeros again.\n\nBut how does this apply to different grid sizes? For example, in Example 1, the grid is 12x12. The middle would be row 6. Let's check the output. In Example 1's output, the 3's expansion reaches row 5 (all 3s in some regions), and then the 8's expansion starts from the bottom.\n\nAnother thought: The output is generated by each non-zero number in the input spreading downward, and for each row, their \"influence\" covers certain columns. The columns covered are determined by the original column and the current row's distance from the source. For example, a number in column c at row r would, in row r+i, cover columns c - i to c + i, but alternated with zeros. But maybe with some parity based on the row or column.\n\nLooking at Example 0's 1 in (0,0):\n\nIn row 0 (same as input), the 1's influence starts at column 0. In row 1, it might spread to columns 0 \u00b11, but since the output in row1 starts at column 2, perhaps it's 0 + 2*1 = 2. Then in row2, it's 0 + 2*2 = 4, etc. Wait, but in row0, the 1 is at 0, 2, 4. So for row0, it's steps of 2 from the original position. Then row1 has 1 at 2,4 (steps of 2 from 2), but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each row, the number alternates between the original column and skipping a column. For example, starting at column 0, then every even column (0,2,4,6...) but only up to a certain point. Similarly for the 2 starting at column 9, filling columns 9,7,5... until they meet.\n\nIn Example 0's output row0, 1 is at 0,2,4 and 2 at 5,7,9. So they meet at column5. Then in row4, the 1s fill columns 0-4 and the 2s 5-9.\n\nSo the rule could be: For each non-zero number in the input row, in each subsequent row, the number spreads to the left and right, but every other column, creating a widening strip until the middle row. Then, after the middle, the strip contracts.\n\nBut how to model the spreading. Let's think of each number as generating a triangle. For example, the 1 in (0,0) creates a triangle that expands to the right by 2 columns per row. So in row0: 0,2,4; row1: 2,4; row2: 0,2,4; row3: 2,4; row4: 0-4 (filled with 1s). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers expand in a way that the distance from the original column is equal to the row index. For example, in row i, the number is placed in columns c \u00b1 i. But that would create a diamond shape.\n\nFor example, if a number is at column c in row r, then in row r+i, it's placed in columns c - i and c + i. But in the examples, the numbers are spreading more than that.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output row0, the 1 is at 0,2,4. If the original is at row0, column0, and the current row is 0 (same row), then columns 0 + 0*2 =0, 0+1*2=2, 0+2*2=4, etc., but how far does it go? Maybe each number starts in its original position and then every even column (for 1) or every odd (for another number). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern for a number starting at column c in the input row is to spread to the right (if the number is in the left half) or to the left (if in the right half) with each row, and each step fills every other column. For example, the 1 in column0 of row0 spreads to column2 in row0, then column4, etc., until the middle. The 2 in column9 spreads to column7,5, etc., until the middle. Then, when they meet, they form a solid block.\n\nThis would explain Example0's row0: 1 is at 0,2,4 (columns 0, 2,4) and 2 at 5,7,9 (columns5,7,9). The middle is between columns4 and5, so they meet at the middle.\n\nThen, in row1, the 1s are at 2,4 (maybe stepping one row down reduces the spread?), and the 2s are at5,7. Then in row2, the 1s are at 0,2,4 again, but perhaps expanding. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's think of each number in the input as generating a wave that propagates downwards and outwards (left and right). Each wave has a certain width per row, and when two waves meet, they alternate.\n\nAlternatively, think of each non-zero number as creating a \"light cone\" expanding downward. The leftmost number spreads to the right and down, and the rightmost number spreads to the left and down. When they meet, their values alternate or combine.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAnother approach: For each row in the output, the value at column j is determined by the original numbers in the input's first row. For example, for each number in the input's first row at column c, in the output row i, the columns affected are c \u00b1 i, but with some alternation. But in the examples, the columns affected are more than that.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated such that each original number in the input's first row starts at their column and, for each subsequent row, their influence expands to the left and right by one column each, but alternates between their value and zero.\n\nFor example, in Example0's input, 1 is at column0. In row0 (same row), the influence is column0. In row1, columns0-1. In row2, columns0-2. But the output in row0 shows 1s at columns0,2,4. So maybe the expansion skips columns. Alternatively, the expansion is every other column, based on the row parity.\n\nAlternatively, the expansion is such that each number alternates between filling even and odd columns in each row. For example, in row0, the 1 starts at column0 (even), then in row1, fills column1 (odd), row2, column2 (even), etc. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers spread in a way that their value is placed at positions that are a certain distance from their origin, but modulated by some function. For example, the 1 in column0 spreads to columns 0, 2, 4 in row0, 2,4 in row1, 0,2,4 in row2, etc. This seems to form a pattern where the even rows have more spread out positions, and odd rows have less.\n\nBut how does this apply to multiple numbers? Like the 1 and 2 in Example0. Their spread patterns meet in the middle and then form a solid block.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that each non-zero number in the input creates a pattern where, in even rows, it spreads to the right (for left-side numbers) or left (for right-side numbers) by even steps, and in odd rows, by odd steps. So for the 1 in column0:\n\n- Row0 (even): columns 0, 2, 4, 6... up to the middle.\n- Row1 (odd): columns 1, 3, 5...\nBut this doesn't match Example0's output. For example, in row0, the 1 is at 0,2,4, which are even columns. In row1, the 1 is at 2,4 (even columns), which is not odd.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: The pattern is based on the row index and column index. For each original number at (0, c), in the output row i, column j, the value is determined by whether j - c is even or odd. For example, for the 1 at c=0, in row i, if (j - 0) is even, then the cell is 1; otherwise 0. But this would create a checkerboard pattern. But looking at Example0's row0, the 1 is at 0,2,4 (even j), which fits. But then in row1, the 1 is at 2,4 (even j), but according to (j - 0) even, this would still hold. But row1 is for i=1. Maybe the row index affects it. Like (i + j) even.\n\nAlternatively, for the 1 at (0,0), in output row i, column j, the value is 1 if (i + j) is even. Let's check:\n\nRow0 (i=0): j=0 (0+0=0 even) \u2192 1; j=1 (0+1=1 odd) \u2192 0; j=2 (0+2=2 even) \u21921, etc. So in row0, columns 0,2,4,6,8 would be 1. But in Example0's output row0, 1 is at 0,2,4 and then switches to 2 at 5. So maybe the 1 is limited to the first half and the 2 to the second half. So the pattern is that each number spreads in a checkerboard pattern but only within their respective halves.\n\nBut how are the halves determined? The midpoint of the columns. For even columns, the midpoint is between columns 4 and5 (for 10 columns). The 1 fills up to column4, and the 2 starts from column5.\n\nSo combining these ideas: Each original number spreads in a checkerboard pattern (based on i+j even/odd) but only in their respective regions. The 1 in the left half and the 2 in the right. Then, when their regions meet, the values alternate.\n\nBut how does this explain the outputs where the entire row is filled with 1s and 2s in the middle rows?\n\nPerhaps the checkerboard pattern only applies up to a certain row, after which the regions merge into solid blocks. For example, in Example0's row4, the entire left half is 1s and the right half 2s. So up to row4, the checkerboard pattern is used, and then after that, the solid blocks.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent. Alternatively, the checkerboard pattern continues, but when the regions overlap, they combine. But how?\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let me look for another approach. Perhaps the numbers in the input are the only ones that generate their respective patterns, and the output is built by combining these patterns. For example, each non-zero number generates a wave that propagates down and left/right, and in each cell, the value is the sum of the waves from different sources. But since the output numbers are the same as the original (not sums), maybe it's more like each cell takes the value of the nearest source, or follows some priority.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are moving down and to the left/right in each row. For example, the 1 in column0 moves down to the right, and the 2 in column9 moves down to the left. Each step, they shift one column and alternate between their value and zero. But in Example0's row0, the 1 is at 0,2,4. So maybe they shift two columns each row.\n\nWait, maybe each row i has the number placed at the original column \u00b1 i*2. For example:\n\nOriginal 1 at column0. In row0 (i=0), 0 \u00b1 0*2=0 \u2192 [0]. But in the output, it's 0,2,4. Hmm, not matching. \n\nAlternatively, the number spreads to columns that are \u00b1i*2 from the original column. For row0 (i=0), columns 0. But in the output, it's 0,2,4. So perhaps for each step in the row, the number spreads outward by 2 columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the spread is based on the row's index. For example, in row i, the number's influence covers columns original \u00b1 i. But since the output in row0 has 0,2,4, maybe multiplied by 2: columns original \u00b1 2*i. So for i=0: 0 \u00b10=0. i=0: 0. But Example0's row0 has 1 at 0,2,4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each row i is such that the number's presence is at columns c \u00b1 (i), but alternated. Like, in row i, the number is at c - i and c +i. But again, this doesn't explain the multiple positions.\n\nAlternatively, the number propagates down and to the right, with each row adding a step of 2 columns. For example, the 1 starts at column0. In row0, column0. In row1, columns0+1*2=2. In row2, columns0+2*2=4. So in row0:0, row1:2, row2:4, etc. But this would only fill one column per row. Example0's output has multiple columns filled.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are expanding in such a way that each row adds a new column on both left and right sides. But the example shows that in row0, the 1 is already at 0,2,4. So maybe for even rows (i even), the number is placed at even columns up to i*2, and for odd rows, similar.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are spreading in a way that each row adds a new layer. For example, the 1 in row0 column0:\n\n- Row0: column0 (distance 0)\n- Row1: columns0-1 (distance 1)\n- Row2: columns0-2 (distance 2)\nBut this would create a triangle. But in Example0's output, the 1s are at 0,2,4 in row0, which is more spread out.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the output as follows:\n\nFor each non-zero number in the input row, create a pattern that starts at their column and expands outward (left and right) by one column each row, but the expansion alternates between the number and zero. Then, when two numbers' patterns meet, they create a merged pattern where their values alternate.\n\nFor example, in Example0's input, the 1 starts at column0. In row0, it's at 0. In row1, it spreads to columns0-1. But in the output row0, the 1 is at 0,2,4. So maybe the expansion is two columns per row. So for row i, the 1 is at columns0, 2i. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number's pattern in row i is that it fills every other column starting from the original, up to a certain distance based on i. For example, for the 1 in column0:\n\n- In row0: column0.\n- In row1: columns0,2.\n- In row2: columns0,2,4.\n- And so on, until the middle row.\n\nThen, after the middle row, the pattern contracts similarly. So the width of the pattern is 2i+1 for row i. \n\nBut in Example0's output row0, the 1 is at columns0,2,4. For row0, i=0, which would be 2*0+1=1 column. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each row i, the number's columns are c \u00b1 (i) with a step of 2. So for row0, i=0: c \u00b10 \u2192 c=0. But output row0 has columns0,2,4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for a different pattern. For example, in the output rows, the numbers are arranged in such a way that their positions form a right-angled triangle. For instance, the 1 in Example0's output starts at column0 and in each row, the starting column increases by 2. But not exactly.\n\nAnother approach: For each non-zero number in the input's first row, the output grid is generated by creating a pattern where the number is placed in every other column starting from their original position, and this pattern moves down each row. The direction (left or right) depends on the original position's side. Numbers on the left spread to the right, numbers on the right spread to the left. When they meet, their patterns alternate.\n\nFor example, in Example0's input:\n\n- 1 is in column0 (left side), so spreads to the right every other column.\n- 2 is in column9 (right side), so spreads to the left every other column.\n\nSo in row0 of output:\n\n- 1 is at 0,2,4 (even columns starting from 0)\n- 2 is at 5,7,9 (odd columns starting from 9)\n\nThen in each subsequent row, the starting point moves down and continues spreading. But how?\n\nIn row1, the 1 starts at column2, and the 2 starts at column7. So they've moved two columns towards the center. This continues until they meet in the middle.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\nFor each number in the input row:\n\n- If the number is in the left half, in each subsequent row, the starting column increases by 2 (moving right).\n- If in the right half, the starting column decreases by 2 (moving left).\n- In each row, the number is placed every other column starting from the current starting column.\n- When two numbers meet, their columns alternate.\n\nIn Example0:\n\n- 1 starts at column0. Row0: 0,2,4. Row1: 2,4. Row2: 0,2,4 (but how? Maybe this isn't the case).\n\nWait, perhaps the starting column for the left number increases by 2 each row. So row0: 0, row1: 2, row2:4, etc. For each row i, starting column is 0 + 2*i. Then, the number is placed at starting column and every other column to the right until the middle.\n\nSimilarly, the right number starts at column9, and for each row i, starting column is 9 - 2*i. Then placed every other column to the left.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nRow0 (i=0):\n\n- Left start: 0 \u2192 0,2,4\n- Right start:9 \u21929,7,5\n\nRow1 (i=1):\n\n- Left start:2 \u21922,4,6\n- Right start:7 \u21927,5,3\n\nBut in the output row1 for Example0, the 1 is at 2,4 and 2 is at5,7.\n\nSo for row1:\n\nLeft start is 2, so 2,4 (but why not 6? Maybe the middle is at column4.5 (for 10 columns), so stops at 4 for left and starts at5 for right. So for row1, left stops at4 and right starts at5.\n\nSo the left number in row i starts at 0+2*i and fills every other column to the right until the middle. The right number starts at9-2*i and fills every other column to the left until the middle.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nLet's test for Example0's output:\n\nRow0 (i=0):\n\nLeft start:0 \u2192 columns0,2,4 (up to middle)\nRight start:9 \u2192 columns9,7,5 (down to middle)\n\nRow1 (i=1):\n\nLeft start:0+2*1=2 \u2192 columns2,4\nRight start:9-2*1=7 \u2192 columns7,5\n\nRow2 (i=2):\n\nLeft start:0+2*2=4 \u2192 column4\nRight start:9-2*2=5 \u2192 column5\n\nRow3 (i=3):\n\nLeft start:0+2*3=6 (but middle is at 4.5, so beyond middle \u2192 no left entries)\nRight start:9-2*3=3 (beyond middle \u2192 no entries?)\n\nBut in Example0's row3, the output is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait no, looking back:\n\nExample0's output row3 is [0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0]. Wait no, looking at the original example:\n\nWait, I need to recheck the examples.\n\nLooking back at Example0's output:\n\nThe third row (index3) in the output is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So columns4 and5 have 1 and2 respectively.\n\nHmm. So the previous idea isn't quite matching. So perhaps the starting positions are not exactly 2*i. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, the number's spread is such that in each row, the left number moves right by one column, and the right number moves left by one column. Then, the number is placed in alternating columns from that starting point.\n\nFor Example0's 1:\n\nRow0: starts at0, places 0,2,4.\nRow1: starts at1, places1,3,5. But in Example0's row1, the 1 is at2,4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the starting position for each row is the original column plus the row index. For example, row0:0+0=0, row1:0+1=1, row2:0+2=2, etc. Then, in each row, the number is placed every other column from the starting position. So for row i, the starting column is c +i. But in Example0's row0, the 1 is at0,2,4, which would be starting at0 and step 2. For row1, starting at1, step 2 would be1,3,5. But in Example0's row1, the 1 is at2,4, which is even columns. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe there's a different pattern. Looking at Example3's input and output:\n\nInput:\n[1,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n[0,...]\n...\n[8,0,...]\n\nOutput:\nRow0: [1,0,1,0,2,0,2]\nRow1: [0,0,1,0,2,0,0]\nRow2: [1,1,1,0,2,2,2]\nRow3: all zeros\nRow4: [8,8,8,0,0,2,2]\nRow5: [0,0,8,0,8,0,0]\nRow6: [8,0,8,0,8,0,0]\n\nSo here, the 1 and 2 start in the first row, and the 8 starts in the last row. Their patterns expand upwards and downwards, perhaps.\n\nFor example, the 8 in row6 of the input (row6 index) has output in row4: [8,8,8,0,0,2,2]. So the 8 is spreading upward. The 2 is spreading downward. They meet in the middle.\n\nSo perhaps each number spreads in both directions, upward and downward, but the direction depends on their original position. For example, numbers in the top half spread downward, numbers in the bottom half spread upward. Or perhaps the direction is determined by the row. For example, in Example3, the 1 and 2 are in the first row, so they spread downward. The 8 is in the last row (row6), so spreads upward.\n\nBut how?\n\nIn Example3's output row4 (middle row?), the 8 and 2 are present. The 8 comes from the bottom, and the 2 from the top. So their patterns meet in the middle.\n\nThis suggests that each number propagates towards the middle of the grid. Numbers in the top propagate down, and numbers in the bottom propagate up, each spreading in their respective directions until they meet in the middle.\n\nSo for a grid with N rows, the middle row is at floor(N/2). Each number's influence expands towards the middle row, and then continues past it if possible.\n\nBut how does this explain the specific patterns in the output rows?\n\nIn Example0's input (10x10 grid), the middle row is row5 (0-based, rows0-9). But the output's row4 is filled with 1s and 2s. So perhaps the numbers spread until they meet in the middle.\n\nEach number's pattern in the output is a diamond shape that expands towards the middle row, and then contracts. The direction depends on whether the original row is above or below the middle.\n\nAlternatively, numbers from the top rows spread downward, and numbers from the bottom rows spread upward, each moving one row per step, and expanding their columns in a certain way.\n\nFor Example3's input:\n\n- 1 and 2 are in row0, so they spread downward.\n- 8 is in row6 (original input's last row?), so spreads upward.\n\nIn the output, the 8's influence is seen in row4 and below. The 1 and 2's influence is seen in rows0-3.\n\nThe interaction between the 8 and 2 happens in row4, where both are present.\n\nSo the pattern could be that each non-zero number in the input grid propagates towards the middle of the grid (depending on their original row), and in each step, their influence spreads to adjacent columns, creating a diamond shape. When two numbers meet, their values are placed in alternating columns.\n\nBut how to model the column positions.\n\nAnother observation: The output grid seems to have a certain symmetry. For example, in Example1's output, the 3 in the top-right propagates downward and to the left, while the 8 in the bottom-left propagates upward and to the right. Their patterns interact in the middle.\n\nPerhaps each number's propagation depends on their original position:\n\n- If the number is in the top row, it propagates downward, and to the right if it's in the left half, or to the left if it's in the right half.\n- If the number is in the bottom row, it propagates upward, and to the left if it's in the right half, or to the right if in the left half.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, numbers in the top row spread down and to the right (for left-side numbers) and down and to the left (for right-side numbers). Numbers in the bottom row spread up and to the left (for right-side numbers) and up and to the right (for left-side numbers). \n\nIn Example0's input, the 1 is in the top-left, so spreads down and to the right. The 2 is in the top-right, so spreads down and to the left. Their paths meet in the middle.\n\nBut how this translates to the output rows.\n\nIn Example0's output row0 (same as input row), the 1 is at 0,2,4 (spread to the right), and the 2 is at 5,7,9 (spread to the left). So in each row, the spread is every other column from their starting point.\n\nThen, each subsequent row, the starting column for each number moves one step in their respective direction (right for 1, left for 2), and their influence spreads every other column from there.\n\nSo for row i:\n\n- The 1's starting column is 0 + i (moves right by i columns)\n- Spreads to every other column from there.\n- The 2's starting column is9 - i (moves left by i columns)\n- Spreads to every other column from there.\n\nBut in Example0's row0 (i=0):\n\n1's columns: 0,2,4 (0 +0=0, step 2)\n2's columns:9,7,5 (9-0=9, step -2)\n\nRow1 (i=1):\n\n1's starting column:0 +1=1 \u2192 1,3,5...\nBut in the output, row1 has 1s at2,4. Hmm, this doesn't fit. So maybe the starting column increases by 2 per row. For row i:\n\n1's starting column:0 + 2*i\n\n2's starting column:9 - 2*i\n\nIn row0 (i=0):\n\n1 starts at0 \u21920,2,4\n2 starts at9 \u21929,7,5\n\nRow1 (i=1):\n\n1 starts at2 \u21922,4,6\n2 starts at7 \u21927,5,3\n\nBut in Example0's row1, the 1s are at2,4 and the 2s at5,7. So this doesn't exactly match. The 2's starting at7 would spread to7,5,3. But in row1's output, 2s are at5,7. So maybe they are spread from7,5 (step -2).\n\nBut then why is 7 and5 filled but not 3. Maybe there's a limit to how far they can spread towards the middle.\n\nAlternatively, each number's spread in a row is from their starting column to the middle, stepping by 2 columns. So for 1 in row1 (starting at2), spread to 2,4 (since the middle is at4.5, so stops at4). For 2 in row1 (starting at7), spread to7,5.\n\nThis would explain Example0's row1: 1 at2,4 and 2 at5,7.\n\nSimilarly, row2 (i=2):\n\n1's starting column:0+2*2=4 \u21924,6\nBut middle is4.5, so only 4 is filled.\n2's starting column:9-2*2=5 \u21925,3.\nBut middle is4.5, so 5 is filled.\n\nIn row2's output, 1s are at0,2,4 and 2s at5,7,9. Hmm, but according to this pattern, the 1's starting column is4, so would spread to4,6. But in the output, row2 has 1s at0,2,4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let me try to find a pattern that can be generalized.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\n[4,0,0,...,0] in row0\n[0,...,0] in other rows except the last row, which is [8,0,...,0,1].\n\nSo the input has 4 in row0, column0; 8 in row16, column0; and 1 in row16, column16.\n\nThe output should be generated based on these three numbers.\n\nAccording to the pattern observed in the training examples, each non-zero number in the input propagates towards the middle of the grid. For example:\n\n- 4 in row0, column0 will spread downward and to the right.\n- 8 in row16, column0 will spread upward and to the right.\n- 1 in row16, column16 will spread upward and to the left.\n\nTheir patterns will expand, and where they meet, their values will alternate.\n\nThe middle row of the Test Input is row8 (since it's 17 rows, 0-based). So the numbers will spread toward row8.\n\nThe 4 from the top will reach row8, and the 8 and1 from the bottom will reach row8.\n\nIn the middle row (row8), their influences would meet.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the middle row in the output is filled with the merged patterns of the numbers. For Example0's middle row (row4), it's filled with 1s and 2s.\n\nSo for the Test Input, row8 would likely have 4s from the top, and 8s and 1s from the bottom. But how they interact.\n\nAlternatively, each number's pattern fills every other column in their respective directions.\n\nFor the 4 in row0, column0:\n\n- In each row below, the 4 spreads to the right every other column.\n\nFor the 8 in row16, column0:\n\n- In each row above, the 8 spreads to the right every other column.\n\nFor the 1 in row16, column16:\n\n- In each row above, the 1 spreads to the left every other column.\n\nWhen they meet, their values alternate.\n\nBut how to model this for the Test Input.\n\nAssuming that each number spreads every other column in their respective directions, the 4 would fill even columns starting from column0 in each row below, the 8 fills even columns starting from column0 in each row above, and the 1 fills even columns starting from column16 in each row above.\n\nBut when they overlap, the values might be determined by proximity or priority.\n\nIn the middle row (row8), the 4 from the top would have reached column0+8*2=16 (but 17 columns, 0-16). So column16. The 8 from the bottom would have spread to column0+8*2=16 (but from row16, moving up 8 rows). Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each number:\n\n- The number's spread in the output grid is determined by the distance from their original row and column.\n- The columns filled are original column \u00b1 (distance) * 2, where distance is the number of rows away from the original row.\n\nFor example, the 4 is in row0, column0. For a row i, the distance is i. So columns filled are 0 \u00b1 i*2. But since it can't go negative, for row i, columns 0 + 2*i. So for row0, 0+0=0. Row1: 2, row2:4, etc. But this would go beyond the grid.\n\nIn the Test Input, which has 17 columns (0-16):\n\nFor the 4 in row0, column0:\n\n- In row8 (middle), columns filled would be 0 + 2*8 =16. But 16 is the last column. So in row8, the 4 would be at column16. But in the same row, the 1 from row16, column16 would also be spreading upwards. The 1's distance from row16 to row8 is 8 rows. So columns filled would be 16 - 2*8=0. So 1 is at column0 in row8.\n\nSo in row8, column0 has 1 (from bottom), column16 has4 (from top). But how do they interact in between?\n\nPerhaps in row8, the 4 is at even columns starting from16 (but that's only column16), and the 1 is at even columns starting from0 (column0). The 8 from row16, column0 would be at column0 +2*8=16. So in row8, column16 would have both 4 and8? That seems conflicting.\n\nBut in the training examples, when two numbers meet, their values alternate. So maybe in the overlapping columns, the values alternate between the two numbers.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Given the time constraints, I think the best approach is to generate the Test Input's output based on the pattern observed in the examples.\n\nThe Test Input has 4 in the top-left, 8 in the bottom-left, and 1 in the bottom-right. Each of these numbers will generate expanding patterns towards the middle of the grid.\n\nIn the middle row (row8), the 4 from the top would have spread to the right, the 8 from the bottom would spread to the right, and the 1 from the bottom would spread to the left. Their interaction would create alternating patterns.\n\nLooking at Example2's input and output, which has 2 in the top-left and4 in the bottom-left, the output has their patterns meeting in the middle. The middle rows show the 2s and4s in their respective regions.\n\nSo for the Test Input's output, the middle row (row8) would likely have the 4s on the left, 8s in the middle, and 1s on the right. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, each number's pattern expands to fill their respective regions, and in overlapping areas, they alternate.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed to generate the output based on the patterns observed.\n\nFor the Test Input, which is a 17x17 grid:\n\n- The non-zero numbers are 4 (row0, column0), 8 (row16, column0), and 1 (row16, column16).\n\nEach of these numbers will propagate towards the middle row (row8), spreading their values in alternating columns.\n\nThe 4 from row0, column0 spreads downward, filling even columns (0, 2, 4,...) in each row.\n\nThe 8 from row16, column0 spreads upward, filling even columns (0, 2, 4,...) in each row.\n\nThe 1 from row16, column16 spreads upward, filling even columns (16,14,12,...) in each row.\n\nWhen these patterns meet in the middle rows, they alternate or combine.\n\nIn row8, the 4 from the top would have filled even columns from0 up to16 (0+2*8=16). The 8 from the bottom would also have filled even columns up to16. The 1 would have filled even columns from16 down to0. So there would be conflicts between 4,8, and1 in column0 and16. \n\nBut according to Example1's output, when multiple numbers meet, their values alternate based on their position. For example, in Example1's row0, the 3 and8 alternate.\n\nHowever, without a clear pattern, it's challenging to determine the exact output. Given the time constraints, I'll generate the output based on the following assumptions:\n\n- Each number spreads every even column starting from their original column, moving towards the middle row.\n- When multiple numbers are present in a column, the latest one (from the bottom) takes precedence.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the numbers alternate based on their original positions.\n\nGiven the complexity, here's an attempt to construct the Test Input's output:\n\nThe 4 in row0, column0:\n\n- Spreads down, filling even columns (0,2,4,...16) in each row until row8. From row9 onward, it might contract, but since the Test Input's grid is 17 rows, row8 is the middle.\n\nThe 8 in row16, column0:\n\n- Spreads up, filling even columns (0,2,4,...16) in each row until row8.\n\nThe 1 in row16, column16:\n\n- Spreads up, filling even columns (16,14,12,...0) in each row until row8.\n\nIn the middle row (row8), the even columns would have:\n\n- Column0: 4 and8 (conflict). Perhaps 8 takes precedence as it's from the bottom.\n- Columns2-14: alternating between4 and8 from the left and1 from the right.\n- Column16: 4 and1 (conflict). Perhaps1 takes precedence.\n\nBut this is highly speculative. Given the training examples, when a number is in the bottom row, its pattern tends to propagate upward and to the right or left. For example, in Example1's input, the 8 is in the bottom row and spreads upward, filling columns to the right.\n\nIn the Test Input's case, the 8 is in the bottom-left, so it might spread upward and to the right, filling even columns. The 1 is in the bottom-right, so spreads upward and to the left, filling even columns.\n\nIn row8, the 8 from the bottom-left would have filled even columns starting from0 to16. The 1 from the bottom-right would have filled even columns from16 to0. The 4 from the top-left would have filled even columns from0 to16. So all even columns would have conflicts.\n\nBut according to Example1's output, when two numbers meet, they alternate. For example, in Example1's row0, the 3 and8 alternate starting from the right and left.\n\nSimilarly, in the Test Input's middle row, even columns could alternate between4,8, and1. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll proceed to generate an output similar to the examples, assuming that each number spreads to every other column, and when they meet, they alternate. The 8 and4 might combine in the left half, and 1 and8 in the right half.\n\nBut given the test input's size and complexity, the output will likely have expanding patterns of 4,8, and1, meeting in the middle and alternating.\n\nThe Final answer is as follows, following the structure of the training examples:",
