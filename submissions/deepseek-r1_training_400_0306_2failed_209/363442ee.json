        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of numbers, and the output is another list. The first thing I notice is that in all the examples, the fourth element is always 5. Maybe that's a separator or a key position.\n\nLet's take Example 0. The input starts with [4,2,2,5...] and the output is [4,2,2,5,4,2,2,0...]. So after the 5, the first three elements (4,2,2) are repeated again. Then in the next line, the input is [2,6,2,5...] and the output is [2,6,2,5,2,6,2...]. So same pattern: the first three numbers after the 5 are copies of the first three elements. But then in the third input line of Example 0, [6,4,4,5...] becomes [6,4,4,5,6,4,4...]. So this repetition seems consistent.\n\nBut wait, looking at other rows in the examples. Like in Example 0, the fourth input row is [0,0,0,5...] and the output is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,4,2,2...]. Here, after the 5, instead of repeating the first three, there's 4,2,2. But those were the first three elements from the first input row. Hmm, maybe there's some kind of shifting or grouping based on certain positions.\n\nWait, maybe the input lists are grouped into three-line blocks. For instance, in Example 0's input, the first three lines start with non-zero values, then the next lines start with zeros. The outputs for the first three lines have their first three elements repeated after position 4, while the next lines (starting with zeros) have some other pattern. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's output, rows 0-2 (the first three) have their first three elements repeated starting at index 4. Then rows 3-5 (next three) have their first three elements (all zeros) followed by 4,2,2 (from the first input row?), then the next three rows (6-8) again start with zeros but then have 2,6,2 and 6,4,4. Wait, maybe the outputs for the zero-starting rows are copying elements from the non-zero rows in a cyclic manner.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of 1s in the input indicates where to take elements from. Let me check the inputs. For example, in Example 0's first input, the second line has a 1 at position 5. The output for that line is [2,6,2,5,2,6,2...], so maybe the 1 indicates that the next group is the same as the current. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The first three lines have non-zero starting elements. The first output line for the first input line is [2,7,3,5,0,0,0,2,7,3...]. Wait, here after the 5, the first three elements (positions 4-6) are 0,0,0, but then positions 7-9 are 2,7,3. Which matches the first three elements of the input line. So maybe in some cases, the elements are shifted to different positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each line in the input corresponds to a specific position in a grid, and the output is built by combining elements from previous lines. For example, in Example 0's output, the fourth row (all zeros input) has [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,4,2,2...]. The 4,2,2 here are the first three elements from the first input row. Then the fifth row in output has 2,6,2 (from the second input row). Sixth row has 6,4,4 (third input row). Then the next three rows (7-9) again cycle through the same patterns. So perhaps the zero rows are taking the first three elements from the non-zero rows in sequence, cycling through them.\n\nSo for the zero rows, the output after the 5 is filled with the first three elements of the non-zero rows in order, depending on their position. For instance, in Example 0, the fourth output row (zero input) starts inserting the first non-zero row's elements starting at position 7. Then the fifth output row (zero input) inserts the second non-zero row's elements, and the sixth the third. Then it repeats.\n\nIn Example 1, the outputs for the zero rows have the first three non-zero rows' elements inserted at different positions. For example, the fourth output row in Example 1 starts inserting at position 5, which is 2,7,3 (from the first input row), then the fifth row has 2,3,3 (from the second input row), etc.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that each group of three input rows (non-zero) generates a certain pattern, and the zero rows then replicate these elements in a rotated or shifted manner in their output. The position where they are placed might depend on the presence of 1s in the input.\n\nWait, looking at the test input. The first three lines are non-zero:\n\n[3,3,9,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]\n\n[8,9,8,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThen the next lines are zeros. Following the pattern from the examples, the outputs for the first three lines would be their first three elements repeated after the 5. For example, the first line would become [3,3,9,5,3,3,9,0,...], the second line [8,4,4,5,8,4,4,0...], third line [8,9,8,5,8,9,8,0...].\n\nThen for the zero lines (4th to 9th inputs), their outputs would take the first three elements from the non-zero lines in a cycle. For example, the fourth input line (all zeros) would have in positions 5-7: 3,3,9 (from first non-zero line), then next positions 8-10: 8,4,4 (second line), etc., depending on how the examples did it.\n\nWait, looking back at Example 0's output. The zero input rows (rows 3-8 in input) have outputs that insert the non-zero rows' elements in order. The fourth output row (input row 3) has [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,4,2,2...], where 4,2,2 is from the first non-zero input row. The fifth output row (input row4) has [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,2,6,2...] from the second non-zero input row. The sixth output row (input row5) has [6,4,4...], from the third. Then the seventh output row (input row6) has [4,2,2], same as first again. So it cycles through the non-zero rows.\n\nBut in Example 1, the zero input rows' outputs start inserting at different positions. For instance, the fourth output row (input row3) starts at position5 with 2,7,3 (from first non-zero row), then the fifth output row (input row4) has 2,3,3 (second non-zero row), etc. Then in the next set of zero rows (rows6-8), the insertion starts at position7 again. So maybe the position where the elements are inserted depends on the row's position in the group. For example, in Example 1, the first three zero rows (3-5) insert at position5, and the next three (6-8) insert at position7, and so on. But how is this determined?\n\nAlternatively, the presence of 1s in the input might indicate the insertion points. Looking at the test input's second line [8,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]. The 1s are at positions8 and 11. In the training examples, the outputs sometimes have elements inserted at positions where the input had 1s. But I'm not sure how exactly.\n\nAlternatively, the position where the elements are inserted might be determined by how many 1s are present in the input. For example, if an input line (non-zero) has a 1, then the next insertion point is shifted. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me try to outline a possible pattern step by step.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nThe first three output rows (non-zero inputs) have their first three elements repeated starting at index4. Then the next three output rows (zero inputs) have elements from the first three input rows starting at index7. The following three output rows (zero inputs) again have elements starting at index7, but it's the same cycle as the first three.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nThe first three output rows (non-zero) have their first three elements starting at index7 (output row0: [2,7,3,5,0,0,0,2,7,3...]). Then the next three output rows (zero inputs) have the elements starting at index5 (output row3: [0,0,0,5,2,7,3,0...]). Then the next three (output rows6-8) have elements starting at index7 again but with some repetition.\n\nWait, in Example1's output rows0-2, the elements are placed starting at index7. Then rows3-5 start at index5, and rows6-8 start at index7 again, but in row6, the elements are at index5 and then again at index10.\n\nThis seems a bit inconsistent. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output is constructed by taking the first three elements of the input line and placing them in specific positions in the output, possibly shifted based on some rule. For non-zero lines, they place their own elements after the 5. For zero lines, they take elements from the non-zero lines in a certain order.\n\nFor instance, in Example0:\n\nThe first three output lines (non-zero) have their own first three elements at positions4-6 (indices 4,5,6). Then the next three zero lines have the elements from the first, second, third non-zero lines at positions7-9. Then the next three zero lines again have the same elements at positions7-9. But wait, in Example0, the fourth output line (input row3) has [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,4,2,2,0...]. So positions7-9 are 4,2,2, which are the first three elements of the first input row (row0). The fifth output line (input row4) has 2,6,2 (from row1). Sixth output line (row5) has 6,4,4 (row2). Then rows6-8 have again 4,2,2; 2,6,2; 6,4,4. So it cycles through the first three input rows.\n\nIn Example1, the first three output lines (non-zero) have their elements starting at position7 (output row0: positions7-9 are 2,7,3). Then the next three zero lines (rows3-5) have their elements starting at position5 (output row3: positions5-7 are 2,7,3). Then rows6-8 (zero inputs) have elements starting at position7 again (output row6: positions7-9 are 2,7,3, then positions10-12 are 2,7,3 again). Wait, no, in example1's output row6 is [0,0,0,5,2,7,3,2,7,3,0,0,0]. So positions5-7 are 2,7,3 and positions7-9 are 2,7,3 again? Wait, looking at the list:\n\nOutput row6 of example1: [0,0,0,5,2,7,3,2,7,3,0,0,0]. So positions5-7 are 2,7,3 (index5,6,7), then positions7-9 are 2,7,3 again. But that would mean index7 is 2 (overlapping). Hmm, maybe the output is arranged in such a way that the elements are placed in blocks, possibly overlapping. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is divided into segments. For example, the first four elements are kept as is. Then the next three elements (positions4-6) are filled with the first three elements of the current line (for non-zero lines) or some other lines (for zero lines). Then positions7-9 are filled with another set of elements, and so on.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe first three input lines are non-zero:\n\n[3,3,9,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]\n\n[8,9,8,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nFollowing the pattern of the training examples, their outputs should have their own first three elements placed after the 5. So for the first line, positions4-6 would be 3,3,9. But looking at example0, the first non-zero input line's output starts repeating at position4. So the first line's output would be [3,3,9,5,3,3,9, ...]. Then the second line's output would be [8,4,4,5,8,4,4, ...]. Third line [8,9,8,5,8,9,8, ...].\n\nThen, the zero lines (input lines4-8) would take the first three elements from the non-zero lines in order. So input line4 (all zeros) would output [0,0,0,5, ...] and insert the first non-zero line's elements (3,3,9) starting at some position. But where?\n\nLooking at example0, the zero lines in input have their elements inserted starting at position7 (indices7-9). So for test input line4 (all zeros), the output might insert 3,3,9 at positions7-9. Then input line5 (all zeros) would insert the second non-zero line's elements (8,4,4) at positions7-9. Then input line6 (all zeros) would insert the third non-zero line's elements (8,9,8) there. Then lines7 and 8 would cycle back to the first and second elements again.\n\nBut looking at example1's outputs, the zero lines sometimes insert the elements starting at position5. So maybe the insertion position alternates or depends on some other factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of 1s in the input affects where the elements are inserted. For example, the second line of the test input has 1s at positions8 and 11. In the training examples, outputs for lines with 1s have their elements inserted in different positions. For example, in Example0's input row4 has a 1 at position8, and the output row4 has [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,2,6,2...]. So the 2,6,2 is inserted at positions7-9. But I don't see a direct correlation between the 1s and the insertion positions. Perhaps the 1s are part of a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 1s in the input determines how many times the elements are copied. For example, in Example0, the second input line has a 1 at position5, and the output line copies the first three elements again. But this is unclear.\n\nAnother approach: look at the structure of the output lists. The output lists are of length 13. The first four elements are the same as the input. Then, after position4, there are blocks of three elements repeated, possibly from the first three elements of certain lines. For example:\n\nIn Example0's output row0: [4,2,2,5,4,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The first four elements are input, then 4,2,2 (same as first three), then zeros.\n\nIn row3 (zero input), the output is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,4,2,2,0,0,0]. So after the 5, zeros, then 4,2,2 again. So the blocks are placed starting at index7.\n\nIn Example1's output row0: [2,7,3,5,0,0,0,2,7,3,0,0,0]. So the block starts at index7. But row3 in Example1's output is [0,0,0,5,2,7,3,0,0,0,2,7,3]. So the first block starts at index5 (2,7,3), then another block at index10 (2,7,3).\n\nThis suggests that the blocks are placed at different positions depending on the group. Perhaps the first three output rows (non-zero) place their own elements in positions4-6. Then the next three zero rows place their elements (copied from non-zero rows) in positions7-9. Then the next three zero rows place them in positions10-12. But this may not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, the position is determined by the row's position within the group. For example, each group of three rows (non-zero followed by zeros) has their elements placed at different positions.\n\nBut this is getting a bit vague. Let's try to apply this to the test input.\n\nTest input's first three lines are non-zero:\n\nLine0: [3,3,9,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 Output should be [3,3,9,5,3,3,9, ...] (positions4-6: 3,3,9).\n\nLine1: [8,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0] \u2192 Output would be [8,4,4,5,8,4,4, ...].\n\nLine2: [8,9,8,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 Output [8,9,8,5,8,9,8, ...].\n\nThen the zero lines (input lines3-8) would take the first three elements from these non-zero lines in order. For example:\n\nLine3 (all zeros): output starts with [0,0,0,5, ...], then inserts line0's elements (3,3,9) at positions7-9 \u2192 [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,3,3,9, ...].\n\nLine4 (all zeros but with 1s at positions8 and 11): perhaps insert line1's elements (8,4,4) at positions7-9. So [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8,4,4, ...].\n\nLine5: insert line2's elements (8,9,8) at positions7-9 \u2192 [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8,9,8, ...].\n\nLines6-8 would then cycle back to line0, line1, line2 again.\n\nLine6 (zeros): insert line0's elements (3,3,9) at positions7-9 \u2192 [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,3,3,9, ...].\n\nLine7 (zeros with 1s at positions5 and 8): insert line1's elements at positions7-9 \u2192 [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8,4,4, ...].\n\nLine8 (zeros): insert line2's elements \u2192 [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8,9,8, ...].\n\nBut looking at Example1's outputs, sometimes the blocks are placed in different positions. For instance, the first three non-zero lines in Example1 have their elements placed at positions7-9, and the next three zero lines place them at positions5-7. So perhaps the placement depends on the row's position modulo 3.\n\nAlternatively, the placement alternates between positions4-6, 7-9, 10-12 for each group of three lines.\n\nBut in Example0, the non-zero lines (rows0-2) have their blocks at positions4-6, then the zero lines (rows3-5) at positions7-9, and rows6-8 again at positions7-9. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each group of three lines (non-zero) writes their blocks in a certain position, and the next group (zero) writes in the next position. For example, first group writes in 4-6, next group in7-9, next in10-12, but since the output lists are 13 elements long, perhaps this is the case.\n\nIn Example0's output, rows0-2: blocks at 4-6. Rows3-5: blocks at7-9. Rows6-8: blocks at7-9 again. So maybe the position depends on the group. But why in Example1, rows3-5 have blocks at5-7 and rows6-8 have blocks at7-9 and 10-12.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's try to find a common rule.\n\nAnother observation: in all the outputs, after the initial 5 (position3), the elements are arranged in such a way that the first three elements of the non-zero lines are replicated in specific positions. For zero lines, the replication comes from the non-zero lines in order.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn Example0, the zero lines (input lines3-8) in their outputs have the elements from lines0,1,2 in a cyclic manner. So for output row3 (input row3), it's line0's elements. Row4: line1's elements. Row5: line2's. Row6: line0 again. Row7: line1. Row8: line2.\n\nSo the pattern is that each zero line's output uses the first three elements of the non-zero lines in order, cycling through them every three lines.\n\nAdditionally, the position where these elements are placed may depend on which group of three zero lines they are in. For example, the first group of zero lines (rows3-5) place their elements starting at position7, the next group (rows6-8) also at position7, but in Example1, the first group (rows3-5) start at position5, the next group (rows6-8) start at position7 and 10.\n\nAlternatively, the position where the elements are placed increments by three for each group. For example, group0 (non-zero) at4-6, group1 (zero) at7-9, group2 (zero) at10-12, etc.\n\nBut looking at the test input, the first three non-zero lines would have their elements at4-6, then the next three zero lines (3-5) at7-9, next three (6-8) at10-12. But the output lists have length13, so positions 10-12 exist.\n\nLet's apply this to the test input.\n\nFirst three lines (non-zero) \u2192 elements at4-6:\n\nTest input line0: [3,3,9,5,3,3,9, ...].\n\nTest input line1: [8,4,4,5,8,4,4, ...].\n\nTest input line2: [8,9,8,5,8,9,8, ...].\n\nThen zero lines3-5 (group1): insert elements from non-zero lines0-2 at7-9:\n\nLine3: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,3,3,9, ...].\n\nLine4: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8,4,4, ...].\n\nLine5: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8,9,8, ...].\n\nNext group of zero lines6-8 (group2): insert elements at10-12:\n\nLine6: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,9].\n\nLine7: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,4,4].\n\nLine8: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,9,8].\n\nBut looking at Example1's output, the group2 (rows6-8) have elements at positions7-9 and 10-12. For example, row6 in Example1's output is [0,0,0,5,2,7,3,2,7,3,0,0,0]. So positions5-7 are 2,7,3 (from line0) and positions7-9 are again 2,7,3. So maybe for group1 (zero lines3-5), elements are placed at5-7 and 7-9. This is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the insertion positions are determined by the input's group. For non-zero lines, it's their own elements at4-6. For zero lines, each group of three lines takes elements from non-zero lines and places them starting at positions4+3n, where n is the group index.\n\nBut this is speculative. Let's look for a pattern in the training examples:\n\nExample0:\n\nNon-zero lines (0-2) \u2192 elements at4-6.\n\nZero lines (3-5) \u2192 elements at7-9.\n\nZero lines (6-8) \u2192 elements at7-9 again.\n\nExample1:\n\nNon-zero lines (0-2) \u2192 elements at7-9.\n\nZero lines (3-5) \u2192 elements at5-7.\n\nZero lines (6-8) \u2192 elements at7-9 and 10-12.\n\nExample2:\n\nNon-zero lines (0-2) \u2192 elements at4-6, 7-9, 10-12 (each line has elements in multiple positions). For example, output row0 of example2 is [3,8,6,5,3,8,6,0,0,0,3,8,6]. So elements at4-6, then 10-12.\n\nSo the pattern seems more complex. Maybe each input line's output places copies of the first three elements in multiple positions, determined by some rule.\n\nAlternatively, each input line's output has multiple copies of the first three elements, and the zero lines copy the first three elements from the non-zero lines in a rotating fashion, with the position determined by the line's index.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, perhaps it's better to proceed by trying to apply the observed patterns to the test input.\n\nIn the test input's first three lines (non-zero), their outputs would likely have their first three elements repeated starting at positions4-6. Then for each zero line, the output will take the first three elements from the non-zero lines in the order of the first three lines, cycling every three lines.\n\nFor example, zero lines3-5: line3 takes elements from line0 (3,3,9), line4 from line1 (8,4,4), line5 from line2 (8,9,8). Then lines6-8 repeat line0, line1, line2 again.\n\nThe positions where these elements are inserted would depend on the example. Looking at Example0's zero lines, they insert at7-9. In Example1, zero lines3-5 insert at5-7. But in Example2, the zero lines insert at7-9.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the presence of a 1 in the input line determines the insertion position. For instance, in the test input's second line (line1), there's a 1 at position8. Maybe this causes the insertion to happen at a different position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the insertion position is determined by the number of 1s in the input. For example, if a line has a 1, then the elements are inserted starting at a higher position. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the insertion position is determined by the index of the line within the group. For example, in the test input's zero lines3-5 (group1), they insert at7-9. Then group2 (lines6-8) insert at10-12. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut looking at Example1's group1 (lines3-5) inserts at5-7. Example0's group1 (lines3-5) inserts at7-9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the insertion position for zero lines depends on the number of non-zero lines before them. For example, after three non-zero lines, the first three zero lines insert at positions7-9, next three at10-12, etc. But this also varies between examples.\n\nAlternatively, the insertion position is determined by the index of the line modulo 3. For example, line3 (index3) mod3=0 \u2192 insert at4-6. But line3 in Example0's output inserts at7-9.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the key is that each zero line in the output takes the first three elements of the corresponding non-zero line in the same group. For example, in Example0's output:\n\n- The first three zero lines (input rows3-5) take elements from the first three non-zero lines (rows0-2) in order.\n\nThen the next three zero lines (rows6-8) take the same elements again. So it's a cycle.\n\nBut where are these elements placed? In Example0, they're placed at7-9. In Example1, the first three zero lines (rows3-5) place them at5-7 and the next three (rows6-8) place them at7-9 and 10-12.\n\nThis inconsistency makes it hard to find a rule. However, in the test input's case, perhaps the zero lines (rows3-8) will place the elements from the non-zero lines (rows0-2) in a cyclic order, inserting them at positions7-9 for each zero line.\n\nLooking at the test input's line3 (all zeros), the output would be [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,3,3,9,0,0,0].\n\nLine4 (all zeros with 1s): [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8,4,4,0,0,0].\n\nLine5: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8,9,8,0,0,0].\n\nLines6-8: again cycle through 3,3,9; 8,4,4; 8,9,8 at positions7-9.\n\nBut in Example1, there are cases where the elements are inserted at multiple positions. For example, in Example1's output row3: [0,0,0,5,2,7,3,0,0,0,2,7,3]. So elements are inserted at positions5-7 and 10-12.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the insertion happens in multiple positions for certain lines. But how to determine when this occurs?\n\nAlternatively, the number of times the elements are copied depends on the number of 1s in the input line. For example, if a line has a 1, the elements are copied in multiple places. Looking at Example1's input row4: [0,0,0,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0] (two 1s). The output for this line is [0,0,0,5,2,3,3,0,0,0,2,3,3]. So elements are copied at positions5-7 and 10-12. Each 1 in the input may correspond to a copy of the elements in a specific position.\n\nIf this is the case, then in the test input's second line (input line1) which has 1s at positions8 and 11, the output would copy the elements (8,4,4) at those positions. But how?\n\nLooking at the input line1 of the test input:\n\n[8,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]\n\nThe output should be [8,4,4,5,8,4,4,0,0,0,8,4,4]. Because the 1s are at positions8 and 11, so insert 8,4,4 at positions8-10 and 11-13 (but the list is only 13 elements long, so positions11-13 would be 8,4,4, but since position13 is index12, it's 8,4,4. So output would be:\n\n[8,4,4,5,8,4,4,0, 8,4,4,8,4]\n\nBut that doesn't seem to match the examples. Maybe the 1s indicate where to insert the elements. For example, each 1 in the input means to insert the elements starting at that position. So for input line1, which has 1s at positions8 and 11, the output would have the elements (8,4,4) inserted starting at positions8 and 11.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[8,4,4,5,8,4,4,0,8,4,4,8,4].\n\nBut checking Example1's input row1 (second line):\n\n[2,3,3,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe output is [2,3,3,5,0,0,0,2,3,3,0,0,0]. The input has a 1 at position8. The output has elements inserted at position7-9 (2,3,3). But the 1 is at position8, which is the start of the insertion. So maybe each 1 indicates the starting position for insertion.\n\nIf that's the case, then in test input line1 (with 1s at positions8 and11), the elements (8,4,4) are inserted starting at positions8 and11. So positions8-10 would be 8,4,4 and positions11-13 (which is 11,12) would be 8,4. But the list is 13 elements long, so positions11-13 would be indices10-12 (since lists are 0-based). Wait, perhaps the indices are off. Let me clarify:\n\nIn a 13-element list, indices are 0-12.\n\nA 1 at position8 would mean inserting starting at8. For three elements, they would occupy positions8,9,10.\n\nA 1 at position11 would mean inserting starting at11, but there's only two positions left (11 and12), so inserting three elements would require wrapping or truncating. But in the training examples, perhaps the elements are inserted starting at the position of the 1, even if it extends beyond.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 1 in the input indicates that the elements should be inserted starting at that position. So in test input line1, inserting at8 and11:\n\nInsert first three elements (8,4,4) starting at8 \u2192 positions8,9,10:8,4,4.\n\nThen at11: positions11,12,13 (but 13 is out of bounds). So perhaps only 8 and4 are inserted. But the output lists in the examples don't have truncated elements, so maybe this indicates that the insertion is done in a circular manner or truncated.\n\nLooking at Example1's input row4:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nOutput: [0,0,0,5,2,3,3,0,0,0,2,3,3].\n\nHere, the input has 1s at positions5 and11. The output inserts the elements (2,3,3) starting at5 (positions5-7:2,3,3) and at11 (positions11-13: but 13 is out, so 11-12:3,3). But the output's last elements are [...,2,3,3]. So it's inserted starting at5 and11, resulting in positions5-7:2,3,3 and positions11-12:3,3.\n\nBut the original elements are 2,3,3. So maybe when inserting at11, it starts at11 and takes the first two elements (3,3) because there's not enough space. Or perhaps it inserts all three, but wraps around. This isn't clear.\n\nAssuming that the 1s indicate the starting positions for inserting the first three elements of the line, even if it truncates, then for the test input line1:\n\nInserting at positions8 and11.\n\nAt8: 8,4,4 in positions8-10.\n\nAt11: insert 8,4,4 starting at11, which would occupy positions11,12 (only two spots). So 8,4.\n\nBut in Example1's output, when inserting at position5 and11, the elements are inserted completely. So maybe the insertion is allowed to go beyond the list's length, but the output list remains length13. Thus, inserting at position11 would result in the elements being placed at11-13 (but 13 is index12). So 8,4,4 would be at11,12, and there's no index13, so it's 8,4.\n\nBut this is speculative. Given the complexity, perhaps the safest way is to proceed under the assumption that zero lines copy elements from non-zero lines in order, inserting at positions7-9 for each zero line, and that non-zero lines insert their own elements after the 5. For the test input:\n\nFirst three non-zero lines:\n\nLine0: [3,3,9,5,3,3,9,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLine1: [8,4,4,5,8,4,4,0,0,0,8,4,4] (assuming that the 1s at8 and11 cause insertion there)\n\nBut Example1's input line1 has a 1 and the output inserts at7-9 and10-12, but this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, perhaps the test output will follow the same pattern as the training examples, where each zero line takes the first three elements from the non-zero lines in order, inserting them at positions7-9 for the first three zero lines, then positions10-12 for the next three.\n\nThus, the test output would be:\n\nFor the first three non-zero lines:\n\n[3,3,9,5,3,3,9,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,4,4,5,8,4,4,0,0,0,8,4,4]\n\n[8,9,8,5,8,9,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThen the zero lines:\n\nLine3: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,3,3,9,0,0,0]\n\nLine4: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nLine5: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8,9,8,0,0,0]\n\nLine6: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,3,3,9,0,0,0]\n\nLine7: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nLine8: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8,9,8,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at Example1's outputs, the zero lines have elements inserted in different positions. For example, in Example1's output row3, the elements are inserted at positions5-7. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input is transformed into the output. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first four elements are [4,2,2,5], followed by zeros. The output starts with the same first four elements, then has [4,2,2,0,...]. Wait, the fifth to seventh elements are 4,2,2. That looks like the first three elements of the input. Then after that, there are zeros. \n\nLooking at the next input in Example 0: [2,6,2,5,...], the output becomes [2,6,2,5,2,6,2,0,...]. So again, positions 5-7 are the first three elements of the input. Then, in the third input row of Example 0, [6,4,4,5,...], the output has 6,4,4 in positions 5-7. So this seems like a pattern where the first three elements are copied starting at position 5.\n\nBut wait, in the fourth input of Example 0, which is [0,0,0,5,...], the output starts [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,4,2,2...]. Here, positions 8-10 are 4,2,2. That's similar to the first input's first three elements. Hmm. So maybe the pattern alternates where the first three elements are copied either starting at position 5 or position 8, depending on some condition.\n\nLooking at the outputs, in Example 0, the first three rows (non-zero first elements) have their first three elements copied to positions 5-7. Then the next rows (starting with zeros) have the first three elements from previous non-zero rows copied into positions 8-10. But how does that work across different rows?\n\nWait, maybe each row's output depends on the position of 1s in the input. For example, in Example 0's input, some rows have a 1 in position 8 (like the fourth input [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,1,...]). But how does that relate to the output?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the first three elements of the input array and placing them in a specific position in the output array, with the position determined by the presence of 1s or other values in the input.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. For the first input [2,7,3,5,...], the output has [2,7,3] starting at position 7 (indices 7-9). Then in the fourth input row, the output has [2,7,3] starting at position 5 (indices 5-7). So maybe there's a shift depending on certain conditions.\n\nWait, let me try to see if there's a grid or structure here. The input arrays are 13 elements long. The outputs in the examples seem to place the first three elements of the input in different positions, possibly based on some pattern of the input's elements after the fourth position.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that the input arrays are divided into groups. For example, each input array is split into the first four elements and then the rest. The fourth element is always 5 in all examples. The output seems to involve repeating the first three elements (ignoring the 5) in certain positions later in the array.\n\nBut how to determine where to place them? Looking at Example 0:\n\nInput row 0: [4,2,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput: [4,2,2,5,4,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nSo the first three elements (4,2,2) are placed starting at position 4 (indices 4-6). Then in row 3 of Example 0's input, which is all zeros except the fourth element 5, the output becomes [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,4,2,2,...]. Here, the 4,2,2 is placed starting at position 7 (indices 7-9). So maybe when the first element is zero, the first three elements from some previous non-zero row are placed starting at position 7.\n\nBut how does that relate across rows? Because in Example 0, the first three rows are non-zero, their outputs have their own first three elements in positions 4-6. Then the fourth row (input starts with zeros) has in positions 7-9 the first three elements of the first input. Then the fifth row (input starts with zeros) has positions 7-9 as the first three elements of the second input. Wait, let me check:\n\nExample 0's input rows:\n\nRow 0: [4,2,2,5,...] \u2192 output has 4,2,2 in positions 4-6.\n\nRow 3 (input starts with zeros) \u2192 output has 4,2,2 in positions 7-9. That's the same as row 0's first three elements.\n\nRow 4 (input starts with zeros, but has a 1 in position 8) \u2192 output has 2,6,2 (from row 1's input first three elements) in positions 7-9.\n\nRow 5 (input starts with zeros) \u2192 output has 6,4,4 (from row 2's input first three elements) in positions 7-9.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for rows where the first three elements are non-zero (i.e., the input starts with non-zero), the first three elements are copied into positions 4-6 (indices 4,5,6). For rows where the first three elements are zero, the first three elements of the previous non-zero rows (in order) are copied into positions 7-9 (indices 7,8,9). Then, perhaps when there's another 1 in later positions, the pattern continues further?\n\nLooking at Example 1's outputs:\n\nFirst input row [2,7,3,5,...] \u2192 output has [2,7,3] at positions 7-9 (indices 7,8,9). Then the fourth input row (all zeros except 5) \u2192 output has [2,7,3] at positions 5-7 (indices 5,6,7). Wait, but how is this determined? Maybe there's a rotation or shift in the placement based on some cycle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the placement depends on the presence of a '1' in the input. For example, in Example 0's input row 1, the input has a 1 at position 5 (index 5), and the output copies the first three elements to positions 4-6. But then row 4 has a 1 at position 8 (index 8), and the output copies row 1's elements to positions 7-9.\n\nWait, maybe the position where the 1 is located determines where the elements are copied. For instance, if there's a 1 at position 5 (index 5), then copy the first three elements to positions 4-6. If a 1 is at position 8 (index 8), copy to positions 7-9, and so on. But how does this relate to the examples?\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nRow 0: input has no 1s (after the fourth element). Output copies to 4-6.\n\nRow 1: input has a 1 at position 5 (index 5). Output copies to 4-6 again. But the output is [2,6,2,5,2,6,2,0...], so positions 4-6 (2,6,2) which are the first three elements of row 1's input. So the presence of a 1 here may not affect the placement. Maybe the 1s are part of a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is built by appending the first three elements in different sections of the array. For example, in Example 0's output, each non-zero input row's first three elements are placed starting at position 4, and then the zero rows take the first three elements from prior non-zero rows and place them starting at position 7. Then, in Example 2's outputs, the pattern seems to involve placing the first three elements even further, like positions 10-12.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 2's outputs:\n\nFirst input row [3,8,6,5,...] \u2192 output has [3,8,6] at positions 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12? Wait, the output is [3,8,6,5,3,8,6,0,0,0,3,8,6]. So positions 4-6: 3,8,6; positions 10-12: 3,8,6. So multiple copies?\n\nBut then in the fourth input row of Example 2's output: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,3,8,6,0,0,0]. So positions 7-9 are 3,8,6. Then row 6's output is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,3,8,6,3,8,6], so positions 7-9 and 10-12.\n\nThis suggests that the first three elements are being copied into different segments of the output array. The number of copies might depend on the number of 1s in the input or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row's output is determined by the position of 1s in the input. For example, each 1 in the input indicates where a copy should start. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, Row 1's input has a 1 at position 5 (index 5). The output for row 1 has the first three elements starting at position 4 (indices 4-6). So perhaps the 1 is one position after the start of the copy. But that doesn't fit all cases. For instance, in Example 0's row 4 input has a 1 at position 8 (index 8). The output for row 4 has the first three elements (from row 1's input) starting at position 7 (indices 7-9). So the 1 is at index 8, and the copy starts at 7. That might suggest that each 1 in the input indicates that the next position after the 1 is where the copy starts. But how does that apply across different rows?\n\nAlternatively, the 1s might be markers that determine which previous row's elements are copied. For example, each 1 in the input might correspond to a previous non-zero row, and the position of the 1 determines where in the output array the copy is placed.\n\nLooking at Example 0's row 4 input: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. The output for this row is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,2,6,2,0,0,0]. The copied elements (2,6,2) are from row 1's input. Row 1's input is [2,6,2,5,0,1,0,...]. So maybe the presence of a 1 in row 4's input (position 8) indicates that the elements from a previous row (perhaps row 1) are copied starting at position 7. But how is the previous row determined? Maybe it cycles through the non-zero rows in order.\n\nIn Example 0, the non-zero rows are rows 0,1,2. Then, the zero rows (rows 3,4,5,6,7,8) each copy the first three elements of rows 0,1,2,0,1,2, etc., in a rotating manner. For example:\n\nRow 3 (zero input) copies row 0's elements at position 7-9.\n\nRow 4 copies row 1's elements at position 7-9.\n\nRow 5 copies row 2's elements at position 7-9.\n\nRow 6 copies row 0's elements again.\n\nRow 7 copies row 1's elements again.\n\nRow 8 copies row 2's elements again.\n\nThat fits with Example 0's outputs. Similarly, in Example 1's outputs:\n\nNon-zero rows are 0,1,2. Then zero rows 3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nRow 3 (zero input) copies row 0's elements at positions 5-7 (but wait, in Example 1's row 3 output, the first three elements are [0,0,0,5,2,7,3,...], so positions 5-7 are 2,7,3 (from row 0's input). Then row 4's output has 2,3,3 (from row 1's input) at positions 5-7. Row 5's output has 3,7,7 (row 2's input) at positions 5-7. Then rows 6,7,8 have copies starting at position 7-9 again. So maybe there's a cycle where the zero rows alternate between copying to positions 5-7 and 7-9, cycling through the non-zero rows each time.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with Example 0. Alternatively, maybe the number of 1s in the input affects where the copies are placed. For instance, in Example 1's row 4 input has two 1s (positions 5 and 11), and the output copies row 1's elements to positions 5-7. Then row 7's input has two 1s (positions 5 and 8?), and the output copies to positions 7-9.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 1s in the input might determine how many copies are made. For example, each 1 in the input could correspond to a copy of the first three elements at a certain position. Like, the first 1 causes a copy at one position, the second 1 at another, etc.\n\nLooking at Example 2's first input row: [3,8,6,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is [3,8,6,5,3,8,6,0,0,0,3,8,6]. So positions 4-6, 7-9 (but zeros there), and 10-12 have the first three elements. Maybe because there are two 1s in the input? Wait, the input for that row has no 1s. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input row 1: [9,8,2,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]. The output is [9,8,2,5,9,8,2,0,0,0,9,8,2]. So positions 4-6, 7-9 (zeros), and 10-12. So three copies, but the input has two 1s. This might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of copies depends on the number of 1s plus one. In row 1 of Example 2's input, two 1s \u2192 three copies. But in the first row of Example 2's input, no 1s, but output has three copies. Hmm, that doesn't add up.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, it seems like each non-zero row's first three elements are copied into the output in certain blocks, and the zero rows take from the non-zero rows in a rotating manner. For example:\n\nIn Example 0, the non-zero rows (0,1,2) have their first three elements copied into the 4-6 positions. Then the zero rows (3,4,5) copy those same elements into 7-9 positions, cycling through rows 0,1,2. Then the next set of zero rows (6,7,8) copy again into 4-6 positions but this time for the zero rows? Wait, no. Looking at Example 0's outputs:\n\nRow 3 (zero input) \u2192 copies row 0's elements into 7-9.\n\nRow 4 \u2192 copies row 1's elements into 7-9.\n\nRow 5 \u2192 copies row 2's elements into 7-9.\n\nRow 6 \u2192 copies row 0's elements into 7-9 again.\n\nRow 7 \u2192 copies row 1's elements into 7-9 again.\n\nRow 8 \u2192 copies row 2's elements into 7-9 again.\n\nSo it's a repeating cycle of the non-zero rows. But why the shift in the output positions? Maybe the zero rows alternate between different positions. Wait, in Example 1's outputs, zero rows 3,4,5 copy into positions 5-7, then rows 6,7,8 copy into positions 7-9. So the position shifts based on some factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output positions for copies from non-zero rows are determined by the index modulo 3 or something. But I'm getting stuck.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look for the structure in the outputs. Each output array has the same first four elements as the input (since the fourth element is 5 in all cases). Then, after that, there are segments where the first three elements are copied. For example:\n\nIn Example 0's first output row: [4,2,2,5,4,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So after the fourth element (5), the next three elements are the first three of the input. Then positions 7-9 are zeros, but in row 3's output, those positions are filled.\n\nSo maybe the output array is divided into blocks of three elements each, starting after the fourth element. So positions 4-6, 7-9, 10-12. Each of these blocks is filled with the first three elements of some row. The non-zero input rows fill their own block (e.g., the first non-zero row fills block 4-6, the second fills 7-9, etc.), but that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the first non-zero row fills block 4-6. The second non-zero row (row 1) also fills block 4-6. But their outputs have their own blocks. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's list for each input row in the examples what the output looks like and see if there's a pattern.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput rows 0-2 are non-zero. Their outputs have their first three elements in positions 4-6.\n\nInput rows 3-8 are all zeros except the fourth element. Their outputs have in positions 7-9 the first three elements of the previous non-zero rows in order (row 0,1,2,0,1,2).\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput rows 0-2 are non-zero. Their outputs have their first three elements in positions 7-9, 7-9, 7-9.\n\nWait, no. Looking at Example 1's outputs:\n\nRow 0: [2,7,3,5,0,0,0,2,7,3,0,0,0]. So first three elements are at positions 7-9 (indices 7-9). Then rows 1 and 2 have their first three elements in positions 7-9 as well. \n\nThe zero rows (3-8) have in their outputs:\n\nRow 3: copies row 0's elements to positions 5-7.\n\nRow 4: copies row 1's elements to positions 5-7.\n\nRow 5: copies row 2's elements to positions 5-7.\n\nRow 6: copies row 0's elements to positions 7-9 again.\n\nRow 7: copies row 1's elements to positions 7-9 again.\n\nRow 8: copies row 2's elements to positions 7-9 again.\n\nSo in Example 1, non-zero rows have their first three elements copied to positions 7-9, and the zero rows copy from non-zero rows into positions 5-7 and then again into 7-9.\n\nExample 2's non-zero rows have their first three elements copied into multiple blocks. For example, the first input row's output has the first three elements in positions 4-6, 10-12. The zero rows in Example 2 copy into positions 7-9 and 10-12.\n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe there's a pattern where each non-zero row's first three elements are written into a certain position based on their index, and zero rows copy from previous non-zero rows in a rotating manner, with the position determined by some cycle.\n\nAlternatively, the position where the first three elements are copied alternates between different segments based on the number of the row. For example, the first non-zero row's elements are copied into positions 4-6, the next into 7-9, the next into 10-12, then looping back. But the examples don't clearly show this.\n\nAnother possibility: the output has the first three elements of the input copied in different places based on the presence of 1s in the input. For example, each 1 in the input after the fourth element indicates a position where a copy starts. So if there's a 1 at position 5 (index 5), then the first three elements are copied starting at position 4 (index 4). If there's a 1 at position 8 (index 8), they start at 7. But looking at Example 0's row 1 input: [2,6,2,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output copies the first three elements at positions 4-6. There's a 1 at index 5, so maybe the copy starts at index 4 (5-1). Then in row 4's input: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], the 1 is at index 8, so copy starts at 7. That would fit. Then, the first three elements are copied starting at position (position of 1) -1. But what if there are multiple 1s?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input row 1: [9,8,2,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]. There are two 1s at indices 5 and 11. The output is [9,8,2,5,9,8,2,0,0,0,9,8,2]. So copies start at 4 (5-1), 7 (but 7-9 are zeros?), and 10 (11-1). But the output shows copies at 4-6, 7-9 (but zeros there), and 10-12. Wait, maybe each 1 allows a copy at (1's index -1) and the first three elements are placed there. So for two 1s in the input, you get two copies. But why in Example 2's row 1 output, there are three copies (4-6, 10-12), but two 1s. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are not the trigger, but the number of copies corresponds to the number of 1s plus one. For example, if there are two 1s, you get three copies. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nLet me try to look at all examples again to see if there's a common pattern.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- Non-zero input rows: their first three elements are copied starting at position 4 (index 4).\n- Zero input rows: their first three elements are copied from previous non-zero rows, starting at position 7 (index 7).\n\nIn Example 1:\n\n- Non-zero input rows: their first three elements are copied starting at position 7 (index 7).\n- Zero input rows: copies start at position 5 and then position 7.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\n- Non-zero input rows: their first three elements are copied at positions 4, 7, and 10.\n- Zero input rows: copies start at positions 7 and 10.\n\nHmm. The pattern seems to vary between examples, which is confusing. But perhaps there's a higher-level pattern. Looking at the position where the first three elements are copied:\n\nFor Example 0's non-zero rows: copied at position 4.\n\nFor Example 1's non-zero rows: copied at position 7.\n\nFor Example 2's non-zero rows: copied at position 4, then 7, then 10.\n\nWait, in Example 2's first output row, the first three elements are at 4-6, and again at 10-12. So maybe the pattern is that each subsequent example shifts the starting position further.\n\nAlternatively, the position could be determined by the example's index. Example 0: position 4, Example 1: position 7, Example 2: position 4,7,10. But that seems inconsistent.\n\nAnother angle: the output array is being divided into sections of three elements each, starting after the fourth element. The non-zero rows' first three elements are placed in these sections, possibly in a round-robin fashion. For example, each non-zero row in the input fills the next available section in the output. But this would require tracking state across rows, which might be possible if the problem is designed to have a global state.\n\nHowever, looking at the training examples, each row's output is determined solely by its own input and possibly the previous rows. But since each example has multiple rows, perhaps the pattern is that the first three elements of each non-zero row are placed into the output array's next available block, and zero rows take from previous blocks.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to find a rule that can generate all training examples.\n\nAnother observation: In the output arrays, the first three elements are preserved, followed by 5, and then sequences of the first three elements appearing again in certain positions. The positions vary between different examples but follow a pattern within each example.\n\nIn Example 0, the non-zero rows have their first three elements copied into positions 4-6, and the zero rows copy them into 7-9. In Example 1, non-zero rows are copied into 7-9, zero rows into 5-7 and 7-9. In Example 2, non-zero rows are copied into 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12, while zero rows copy into 7-9 and 10-12.\n\nThis suggests that for each example, the number of copies increases. Example 0 has two copies (positions 4-6 and 7-9), Example 1 has two copies (positions 5-7 and 7-9), and Example 2 has three copies (4-6, 7-9, 10-12). \n\nBut why the difference? Maybe the pattern depends on the number of non-zero rows. Example 0 has three non-zero rows, Example 1 also three, Example 2 has three. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the position depends on the presence of 1s in the input. Let's look for 1s in the input arrays.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow 1 has a 1 at position 5.\n\nRow 4 has a 1 at position 8.\n\nRow 7 has a 1 at position 8.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nRow 1 has a 1 at position 8.\n\nRow 4 has a 1 at position 5 and 11.\n\nRow 7 has a 1 at position 5 and 8.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nRow 1 has a 1 at positions 5 and 11.\n\nRow 4 has a 1 at position 8.\n\nRow 7 has a 1 at positions 8 and 11.\n\nHmm, this is a bit all over the place. Maybe each 1 in the input array (after the fourth element) indicates where a copy of the first three elements should start. For example, a 1 at position 5 (index 5) would mean copy the first three elements starting at position 4 (index 4). A 1 at position 8 (index 8) would start at 7, and so on.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example 0's row 1:\n\nInput: [2,6,2,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThere's a 1 at index 5. According to the hypothesis, copy the first three elements (2,6,2) starting at index 5-1=4. The output is [2,6,2,5,2,6,2,0,...], which matches positions 4-6. So this works.\n\nIn Example 0's row 4 input: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. A 1 at index 8. Copy from index 7. The output is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,2,6,2,0,...]. The copied elements (2,6,2) are from row 1's input. Wait, but according to the hypothesis, the 1 in row 4's input would indicate to copy from the current row's first three elements. But since this row's first three are zeros, maybe it copies from the previous non-zero row's elements. But how to determine which row?\n\nAh, this complicates things. So the hypothesis is that each 1 in the input array (after the fourth element) causes the first three elements of some row to be copied starting at position (index of 1) -1. But for zero rows, which first three elements are used? Maybe they cycle through the non-zero rows in order.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's zero rows (3-8), the copies are from the non-zero rows 0,1,2,0,1,2. So row 3's 1 (if any) would use row 0's elements, row 4's 1 would use row 1's elements, etc. But in Example 0's row 4 input, the 1 is at index 8, so copy starts at 7, using row 1's elements.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the rule would be:\n\nFor each input row:\n\n- The first three elements are followed by 5, then a series of zeros and possibly 1s.\n\n- For each 1 in the input array after the fourth element (positions 4 to 12), the first three elements of a certain row are copied starting at (position of 1) -1.\n\n- The certain row depends on the order of the rows with 1s. For non-zero rows, it's their own first three elements. For zero rows, it cycles through the previous non-zero rows in order.\n\nBut this requires keeping track of the non-zero rows and their order. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nNon-zero rows are 0,1,2.\n\nZero rows start from row 3.\n\nFor each zero row, when there's a 1, it uses the next non-zero row's elements in a cycle.\n\nRow 3's output has 4,2,2 (from row 0) at positions 7-9.\n\nRow 4's output has 2,6,2 (from row 1) at positions 7-9.\n\nRow 5's output has 6,4,4 (from row 2) at positions 7-9.\n\nRow 6's output has 4,2,2 (from row 0) again.\n\nEtc.\n\nSo for zero rows, each time a 1 is encountered in the input, the copy uses the next non-zero row's elements in sequence, cycling back to the start.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[3, 3, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[8, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n[8, 9, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, identify the non-zero rows (rows 0,1,2).\n\nRow 0: [3,3,9,5,...] \u2192 non-zero. Its first three elements are 3,3,9.\n\nRow 1: [8,4,4,5,...] \u2192 non-zero. First three: 8,4,4.\n\nRow 2: [8,9,8,5,...] \u2192 non-zero. First three:8,9,8.\n\nThen rows 3-8 are zeros except for some 1s.\n\nNow, for each row:\n\nRow 0: non-zero. According to the pattern in previous examples, non-zero rows copy their first three elements into positions based on any 1s in their input. But row 0's input has no 1s after the fourth element. Looking at Example 0's row 0, which had no 1s, the output copied the elements to positions 4-6. So perhaps for non-zero rows without 1s, they copy their first three elements to the next available position. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe non-zero rows always copy their first three elements into positions 4-6 unless there's a 1 that dictates otherwise.\n\nIn Example 0's non-zero rows, all have their first three elements copied into 4-6. Even row 1 which has a 1 at position 5: the copy is at 4-6, which is where the 1 is pointing (position 5 \u2192 start at 4).\n\nSo perhaps for non-zero rows, each 1 in the input indicates a copy starting at (position-1). If there are multiple 1s, then multiple copies are made. But in Example 2's first row (non-zero), there are two 1s at positions 5 and 11, leading to copies at 4-6 and 10-12.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow 0: no 1s \u2192 possibly copy to 4-6.\n\nRow 1: has 1s at positions 8 and 11 (indices 8 and 11). So copies start at 7 and 10. So the output would be [8,4,4,5,0,0,0,8,4,4,8,4,4]. But wait, the input row 1 is [8,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]. The 1s are at positions 8 and 11 (indices 8 and 11). So copies start at 7 and 10. Thus, the output for row 1 would have 8,4,4 in positions 7-9 and 10-12. But what about the rest of the output? The first four elements are 8,4,4,5. Then, positions 4-6: 0,0,0 (from input), but perhaps they remain zeros unless there's a 1. So the output would be [8,4,4,5,0,0,0,8,4,4,8,4,4].\n\nRow 2: no 1s. So copies to 4-6. Output would be [8,9,8,5,8,9,8,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nNow for zero rows (3-8):\n\nRow 3: no 1s. So output is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But according to previous examples, zero rows without 1s may copy previous non-zero rows. But if there are no 1s, maybe nothing is copied.\n\nRow 4: has 1s at positions 5 and 11 (indices 5 and 11). So copies start at 4 and 10. Since it's a zero row, the elements copied would be from the non-zero rows in order. The cycle is row 0, row 1, row 2, then repeat. \n\nSo for the test input's zero rows:\n\nRow 3: no 1s \u2192 no copies.\n\nRow 4: two 1s. Let's assume each 1 triggers a copy from the next non-zero row in the cycle. The first 1 at index 5 (position 5) would start copy at 4, using row 0's elements (3,3,9). The second 1 at index 11 (position 11) would start copy at 10, using row 1's elements (8,4,4). So the output for row 4 would be [0,0,0,5,3,3,9,0,0,0,8,4,4].\n\nRow 5: no 1s \u2192 no copies.\n\nRow 6: no 1s \u2192 no copies.\n\nRow 7: two 1s at indices 5 and 8. The first 1 at 5 would start copy at 4, using the next non-zero row in cycle (row 2's elements:8,9,8). The second 1 at 8 would start copy at 7, using the next in cycle (row 0's elements:3,3,9). So output would be [0,0,0,5,8,9,8,3,3,9,0,0,0].\n\nRow 8: no 1s \u2192 no copies.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the order of the cycle. How is the cycle managed?\n\nLooking back at Example 0's zero rows, the copies were from row 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2. So each zero row with a 1 uses the next non-zero row in sequence. So for the test input, the zero rows with 1s would use row 0, then row 1, then row 2, then row 0 again, etc.\n\nFor example, in the test input:\n\nRow 4: two 1s. First 1 uses row 0's elements at copy position 4-6. Second 1 uses row 1's elements at copy position 10-12.\n\nRow 7: two 1s. First 1 uses row 2's elements at 4-6. Second 1 uses row 0's elements at 7-9.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's try to model it step by step.\n\nNon-zero rows in test input: 0 (3,3,9), 1 (8,4,4), 2 (8,9,8).\n\nFor zero rows with 1s, each 1 triggers a copy from the next non-zero row in order, cycling back.\n\nThe order of non-zero rows is row 0, row 1, row 2, then row 0 again, etc.\n\nSo for each 1 in the zero rows:\n\n- First 1 encountered (in row 4's first 1): copies row 0's elements.\n\n- Next 1 (row 4's second 1): copies row 1's elements.\n\n- Then row 7's first 1: copies row 2's elements.\n\n- Row 7's second 1: copies row 0's elements again.\n\nNow, applying this to each test input row:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,9,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Output would be [3,3,9,5,3,3,9,0,0,0,0,0,0] (copies at 4-6).\n\nRow 1: [8,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]. Two 1s at 8 and 11. So copies at 7-9 (using row 1's own elements) and 10-12 (row 1's elements again). Wait, no. Wait, row 1 is a non-zero row. According to the rule for non-zero rows, each 1 in the input indicates a copy of their own elements at position (1's index -1).\n\nSo row 1 has 1s at 8 and 11. So copies would be at 7-9 and 10-12. Thus, the output would be [8,4,4,5,0,0,0,8,4,4,8,4,4].\n\nRow 2: [8,9,8,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. No 1s. So copies own elements to 4-6. Output: [8,9,8,5,8,9,8,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 3: no 1s. Output remains [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]. Two 1s at 5 and 11. \n\nFor zero rows, each 1 uses the next non-zero row in sequence. The first 1 in row 4 would trigger a copy of row 0's elements (3,3,9) starting at position 4 (index 4). The second 1 at position 11 would copy row 1's elements (8,4,4) starting at index 10. So output is [0,0,0,5,3,3,9,0,0,0,8,4,4].\n\nRow 5: no 1s. Output remains [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 6: no 1s. Output remains [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,5,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. Two 1s at 5 and 8. \n\nFirst 1 (position 5) \u2192 copy row 2's elements (8,9,8) starting at 4. Second 1 (position 8) \u2192 copy row 0's elements (3,3,9) starting at 7. So output is [0,0,0,5,8,9,8,3,3,9,0,0,0].\n\nRow 8: no 1s. Output remains [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nSo compiling all these outputs, the final answer would be:\n\n[3,3,9,5,3,3,9,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,4,4,5,0,0,0,8,4,4,8,4,4]\n\n[8,9,8,5,8,9,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,3,3,9,0,0,0,8,4,4]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,8,9,8,3,3,9,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut let's check if this aligns with the training examples' patterns.\n\nIn Example 1, row 4's output was [0,0,0,5,2,3,3,0,0,0,2,3,3], which matches copying from row 1's elements (2,3,3) at positions 5-7 and 10-12, but in the test input row 4's second copy is at 10-12 with row 1's elements (8,4,4). That fits.\n\nThus, the final answer should follow this pattern.",
