        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by analyzing each example carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input is a list of 10 rows, all [0,0] except the last one which is [1,0]. The output alternates between [0,1] and [1,0], starting with [0,1], except the last line is [1,0]. Wait, the output has the same number of rows as the input. So each input row is transformed into an output row. But how?\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 10 rows. The output starts with [0,1], then alternates. But the last input row is [1,0], and the last output is [1,0]. Hmm. Maybe the transformation is related to the position of the 1 in the input. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is 10 rows of [0,0,0], except the last row is [1,0,0]. The output for this example starts with [0,1,0], then [1,0,0], then alternates, and introduces [0,0,1] in some positions. Wait, let's list the output rows for Example 1:\n\nOutput rows for Example 1:\n[0,1,0]\n[1,0,0]\n[0,1,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[0,1,0]\n[1,0,0]\n[0,1,0]\n[0,0,1]\n[0,1,0]\n[1,0,0]\n\nSo, the first output row is [0,1,0], then alternates between [1,0,0] and [0,1,0], but then the third row is [0,0,1]. Hmm. Maybe there's a pattern where each row is shifting the position of the 1 in some way. Let me look for a sequence here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a rotation or a shift of the input's 1. But the input only has a single 1 in the last row. So maybe each row in the output corresponds to a shifted version of that 1, but how?\n\nWait, maybe the output rows are generated based on some cyclic permutation. For example, in the 2-element case (Example 0), the 1 alternates between the two positions. The output rows for Example 0 are:\n\n[0,1], [1,0], [0,1], [1,0], and so on, ending with [1,0]. So it's alternating each row. But the input's only 1 is in the last row. How does that relate?\n\nWait, the input's last row in Example 0 is [1,0]. The output's last row is the same as the input's last row. Then the previous rows alternate. Maybe the output rows are generated by moving the 1 through the rows in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is a shifted version of the previous. For Example 0's output:\n\nRow 1: [0,1]\nRow 2: [1,0]\nRow 3: [0,1]\nRow 4: [1,0], etc. So the pattern is alternating. But how does that connect to the input?\n\nWait, the input has all zeros except the last row. The output seems to be generating a pattern where the 1s are moving back and forth between positions. Maybe the output is a sequence of shifted positions, starting from the position of the 1 in the input, then moving in some way.\n\nLooking at Example 1: input last row is [1,0,0]. The output's first row is [0,1,0], then [1,0,0], then [0,1,0], then [0,0,1], etc. So perhaps the 1 is moving from position 0 to position 1, then back to 0, then to position 2, then back to 1, then to 0, etc. Like a bouncing pattern between positions.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the input's last row is [1,0,0,0]. The output starts with [0,0,0,1], then [0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,0,0,0], then [0,1,0,0], [0,0,1,0], [0,0,0,1], and repeats. So the 1 is moving from the last position (3) to position 2, then 1, then 0, then back to 1, 2, 3 again? Wait, in the output of Example 2:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,1] (position 3)\nRow 2: [0,0,1,0] (pos 2)\nRow 3: [0,1,0,0] (pos 1)\nRow 4: [1,0,0,0] (pos 0)\nRow 5: [0,1,0,0] (pos 1)\nRow 6: [0,0,1,0] (pos 2)\nRow7: [0,0,0,1] (pos3)\nRow8: [0,0,1,0] (pos2)\nRow9: [0,1,0,0] (pos1)\nRow10: [1,0,0,0] (pos0)\n\nSo the movement is from pos3 to pos0, then back to pos3, but then the next rows again go down. Wait, maybe it's a pattern where the 1 moves from the highest index (pos3) down to 0, then back up to pos3 again. So in the first 4 rows, it's going 3,2,1,0 (down), then row5 is 1, row6 is 2, row7 is 3, row8 is 2, row9 is 1, row10 is 0. So the pattern is like a bouncing between the extremes. So for 4 elements, it's moving from end to start, then back in reverse, but maybe in a certain step.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that each output row is a sequence where the 1 moves in a cycle: starting from the original position (the position of 1 in the input's last row), then moving towards the left, then back to the right, creating a bouncing effect.\n\nIn Example 0, the input's last row is [1,0]. The output starts with [0,1] (position1), then [1,0], then alternates. So the movement is between the two positions each step.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's last row is [1,0,0] (position0). The output starts with [0,1,0] (position1), then [1,0,0] (position0), then [0,1,0], then [0,0,1] (position2), then back. So the movement is 0 ->1 ->0 ->2 ->1 ->0 ->2 -> etc. Hmm, perhaps the pattern is expanding the range each time? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by shifting the 1 in each row, moving left and right in a certain pattern. For Example 0, the original 1 is in position0 (last input row). The output rows start with position1, then 0, alternating. For Example1, original position0. Output rows: position1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0. So the pattern here seems to be moving from 0 to1, then back to0, then to2, then back to1, then to0, etc.\n\nWait, in Example1's output rows:\n\nRow1: 1\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:2\nRow5:1\nRow6:0\nRow7:1\nRow8:2\nRow9:1\nRow10:0\n\nSo the movement is like 1-0-1-2-1-0-1-2-1-0. So starting at 1, then alternating between 0,1,2, etc. But how does that connect to the input's 1 at position0?\n\nHmm. Maybe the starting position is determined by the input's 1. In Example0, input's last row is [1,0] (position0). The output's first row is [0,1] (position1), which is the next position. Then alternates. So perhaps the pattern is that for each row in the output, the 1 is moving in a certain direction, starting from the input's 1's position.\n\nWait, but in Example0, the input's last row is position0, and the first output row is position1. Then next row is position0, then 1, then 0, etc. So maybe the movement is that each row alternates between moving to the next position and the previous. For a 2-element case, it's simple: alternating positions.\n\nIn Example1, input's last row is position0. The first output row is position1. Then back to 0, then to1, then to2, then back to1, then 0, etc. So perhaps the pattern is a combination of moving right and left in steps, but expanding the range each time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a mirroring or reflection pattern. For Example2, the movement is 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0. So the 1 moves from the last position (3) down to 0, then back up to3, then down again. But in the given output, after reaching 0 at row4, it goes back to1 (row5), 2 (row6), 3 (row7), then 2 (row8), 1 (row9), 0 (row10). So it's like a bouncing between 0 and 3. So the movement is like a triangle wave, bouncing between the ends.\n\nPutting it all together, the pattern might be that each output row is generated by moving the 1 from the initial position (as in the input's last row) and then moving it in a way that alternates direction each time the end of the array is reached. So for a 5-element test input, the initial position is 0 (since the last input row is [1,0,0,0,0], position0). Then the movement would be similar to previous examples.\n\nIn the test input, which has 5 elements (positions 0 to4), the output would start by moving the 1 from position0 to the right, then left, but maybe in a bouncing pattern. Let's try to see what the pattern would be.\n\nLooking at Example2 (4 elements), the movement after the initial position0 is:\n\nWait, no. In Example2, the input's last row is [1,0,0,0], which is position0. But the output starts with [0,0,0,1] (position3), then position2, 1, 0, then 1, 2, 3, 2,1,0. Wait, that's confusing. So in Example2, the first output row is position3, which is the opposite end of the initial position0. Then it moves left to position2, then 1, then 0. Then back to1, 2, 3, etc. So perhaps the movement starts from the opposite end of the initial position. For example, if the input's 1 is in position0 (leftmost), then the first output row is the rightmost position (position3 in Example2), then moving leftwards until reaching position0, then moving right again. \n\nWait, that's a possible pattern. Let me check:\n\nExample0: input's 1 is in position0 (since it's [1,0]). The output starts with [0,1], which is position1 (the rightmost). Then alternates between 1 and 0. So moving from right to left, then left to right.\n\nExample1: input's 1 is position0. The output starts with position1 (middle of three positions?), then 0, 1, 2, etc. Wait, but in Example1, the first output row is [0,1,0], which is position1. Then next row is [1,0,0] (position0). Then [0,1,0] (position1), then [0,0,1] (position2). Then back to position1, then position0, then position1, position2, then position1, and finally position0. So it's like starting at position1, then moving left (position0), then right (position2), then back left again. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row in the output, the position of the 1 is determined by some formula based on the row index. Let's see:\n\nFor Example0, there are 10 output rows. The positions alternate between 1 and0. So for row i (starting from 0?), the position is (i % 2). But in Example0, the output starts with [0,1], which is position1. So row0: 1, row1:0, row2:1, etc. So yes, for even rows (0-based), position1, odd rows position0. But wait, the output has 10 rows. Let's see:\n\nRow0: [0,1] \u21921\nRow1: [1,0] \u21920\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\n...\nRow9:0 (since 9 is odd). But the last row of the output in Example0 is [1,0], which is row9 (0-based), yes, which would be 0. So that fits. So for Example0, the position alternates between 1 and0, starting with1.\n\nIn Example1, the output has 10 rows. Let's list the positions:\n\nRow0:1 (0-based)\nRow1:0\nRow2:1\nRow3:2\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:1\nRow7:2\nRow8:1\nRow9:0\n\nSo the pattern here is 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0. So for row numbers:\n\n0 \u21921\n1 \u21920\n2 \u21921\n3 \u21922\n4 \u21921\n5 \u21920\n6 \u21921\n7 \u21922\n8 \u21921\n9 \u21920\n\nSo the positions are moving in a wave-like pattern. How to model that? Maybe it's (row index) mod (n-1) where n is the length, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the position is determined by the following: the pattern starts at position (length-1) - initial_pos. For Example0, initial_pos is0. (length-1) is1. So 1-0=1, which is where the first position is. Then, each step alternates between moving left and right. For Example0, after starting at1, it alternates between0 and1.\n\nFor Example1, initial_pos is0. The length is3. So (3-1)-0 =2. But the first position in Example1's output is1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the initial position in the output is (length-1) - initial_input_pos. For Example0, length2, initial0 \u21921-0=1. So yes, first position1. For Example2, input's initial is0. Length4. 4-1-0=3. The first position in the output is3. Which matches Example2's first output row [0,0,0,1]. So that seems to hold.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- For the first output row, the position of 1 is (length-1) - initial_input_pos.\n\nThen, each subsequent row moves the 1 in a certain direction, perhaps decrementing until it reaches0, then incrementing again, creating a bounce effect.\n\nFor example, in Example2:\n\nInitial input pos0. First output pos3. Then each next row decreases the position by1 until reaching0, then increases by1 until reaching3 again, and repeats. Let's check:\n\nRow0:3\nRow1:2\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:1\nRow5:2\nRow6:3\nRow7:2\nRow8:1\nRow9:0\n\nWhich matches the output of Example2. So the movement is 3\u21922\u21921\u21920\u21921\u21922\u21923\u21922\u21921\u21920.\n\nSo the pattern is that the 1 starts at (length-1 - initial_pos) and then moves in a direction, bouncing between the ends.\n\nFor Example1, length3, initial_pos0. So first pos is2 (since 3-1-0=2). Wait, but in Example1's first output row, the position is1, not2. So this contradicts. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.\n\nIn Example1, the input's last row is [1,0,0], so initial_pos0. The output's first row is [0,1,0], which is position1. According to the hypothesis, the first position should be (3-1) -0 =2. But in the output, it's1. So that doesn't fit. So my initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the movement as a snake-like pattern, where the 1 moves back and forth across the array. The direction changes when it hits the end.\n\nBut how does this start?\n\nLooking at Example1 again. The output starts at position1, then 0, then1, then2, then1, then0, then1, then2, then1, then0.\n\nSo the movement is 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0. So the direction changes when it reaches0 or2. So starting at1, then down to0, up to1, up to2, down to1, down to0, up to1, up to2, down to1, down to0.\n\nSo the pattern is that starting at1, moving left (to0), then right to1, then right to2, then left to1, then left to0, then right to1, etc. But why does it start at1 when the input's 1 is at position0?\n\nHmm. There's a discrepancy here. The initial position in the input is0, but the first output row's position is1.\n\nSo perhaps there's a shift here. Maybe the output rows are generated based on the input's 1, but shifted in some way. For example, the output starts with a shifted version of the input's 1.\n\nIn Example0, the input's 1 is at position0. The output's first row has the 1 at position1. Then alternates. So it's as if the initial direction is to move to the right, then alternate.\n\nIn Example1, input's 1 is at0. The first output's 1 is at1. Then to0, then1, then2, etc. So direction is right first, then left, then right, then left again.\n\nIn Example2, input's 1 is at0. Output starts at3, then moves left each time until 0, then right to3 again.\n\nWait, perhaps for even-length arrays, the starting direction is to the left, and for odd-length, to the right? Or another factor.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is determined by the length of the array. For even-length arrays, perhaps the movement starts in one direction, and for odd-length in another. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row corresponds to a certain step of moving the 1 from its initial position, but in a way that alternates direction each time a boundary is hit.\n\nFor example, in Example0 (length2), initial position0. The first step is to move right (to1), then left (to0), then right again, and so on. So the direction alternates each step.\n\nIn Example1 (length3), initial position0. The first step is to move right (to1), then left (to0), then right (to1), then right (to2), then left (to1), then left (to0), etc. So direction alternates when hitting the ends. So when you reach the left end (0), you start moving right. When you reach the right end (2), you start moving left.\n\nWait, let's model this:\n\nFor Example1:\n\nRow0:0 \u2192 initial position. But output starts at1. So maybe the first move is to the right. So from0 to1.\n\nRow1:1 \u2192 next move direction is left (since the previous move was right). So1\u21920.\n\nRow2:0 \u2192 direction changes to right. So0\u21921.\n\nRow3:1 \u2192 continue right (since not at end). So1\u21922.\n\nRow4:2 \u2192 at right end, direction changes to left. So2\u21921.\n\nRow5:1 \u2192 continue left. So1\u21920.\n\nRow6:0 \u2192 direction changes to right. 0\u21921.\n\nRow7:1 \u2192 continue right. 1\u21922.\n\nRow8:2 \u2192 direction left. 2\u21921.\n\nRow9:1 \u2192 continue left. 1\u21920.\n\nBut the output rows for Example1 have positions:\n\nRow0:1\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\nRow7:2\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow9:0\n\nSo the direction is changing each time the end is hit. Starting at0 (input's last row), then output row0 is1 (move right). Then row1 is0 (move left), row2 is1 (move right), row3 is2 (move right again since not at end?), but that doesn't fit. Because if we were to move right from1, we get to2 (row3), then row4 would move left (since we hit the end at2), so 2\u21921 (row4), then left again to0 (row5). Then right to1 (row6), right to2 (row7), left to1 (row8), left to0 (row9).\n\nBut this pattern doesn't align with the output. For example, row3 is2, row4 is1 (left), row5 is0 (left again), but according to the output, row4 is1 (so left from2\u21921), row5 is0 (left from1\u21920). That makes sense. Then row6 would be1 (right from0\u21921), row7 is2 (right from1\u21922), row8 is1 (left from2\u21921), row9 is0 (left from1\u21920).\n\nYes, that matches the Example1 output. So the pattern is:\n\n- Start at the initial position (0 in Example1's input).\n\n- For each output row, move in a direction (initially right for Example1).\n\n- When you hit the end (0 or length-1), reverse direction.\n\nBut wait, the output rows start at1, not0. So why does the first move start with a move to the right?\n\nAh, because the first output row is generated based on the input's last row, but with the 1 shifted. So maybe the initial position is the input's 1's position, but the first step is to move right, then left, etc.\n\nBut in Example0, the initial position is0. First output row is1 (move right). Then left to0, etc.\n\nIn Example2, the input's last row is [1,0,0,0], initial position0. The first output row is [0,0,0,1], which is position3 (the right end). So that's a move to the right end. Then each step moves left until reaching0, then right again.\n\nSo for Example2, the movement is:\n\nRow0:3 (from0 to3, which is a jump to the right end)\n\nRow1:2 (left)\n\nRow2:1 (left)\n\nRow3:0 (left, end hit, direction changes to right)\n\nRow4:1 (right)\n\nRow5:2 (right)\n\nRow6:3 (right, end hit, direction changes to left)\n\nRow7:2 (left)\n\nRow8:1 (left)\n\nRow9:0 (left)\n\nBut the output for Example2's rows are:\n\nRow0:3\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:2\n\nRow6:3\n\nRow7:2\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow9:0\n\nWait, no. The actual output has row6 as [0,0,0,1] (position3), row7 as [0,0,1,0] (2), row8 as [0,1,0,0] (1), row9 as [1,0,0,0] (0). Wait, that's different. So row6 is position3, row7 is2, row8 is1, row9 is0. Wait, no, according to the example given:\n\nExample2's output:\n\nRow7: [0,0,1,0] \u2192 position2\n\nRow8: [0,1,0,0] \u2192 position1\n\nRow9: [1,0,0,0] \u2192 position0\n\nSo the movement after row6 (position3) is to go left to2, then1, then0. So the pattern is:\n\n0\u21923 (somehow), then left to2,1,0 (directions left each time), then right to1,2,3, then left to2,1,0.\n\nBut how does the initial step from0 to3 happen? It's a jump to the opposite end.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that for the first output row, the 1 is moved to the opposite end of the array. Then, each subsequent row moves the 1 in the same direction (left) until hitting the other end, then reversing direction.\n\nBut why would the first step jump to the opposite end?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are generated by rotating the 1 through the array in a specific pattern. For Example0, the 1 is rotated between the two positions. For Example2, it's rotating from position0 to3, then3\u21922\u21921\u21920, then0\u21921\u21922\u21923, etc. But how to model that.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the output is a cycle of shifting the 1 to the right and left, bouncing between the ends.\n\nLet me try to generalize.\n\nThe steps to generate each output row:\n\n1. For the first row of the output, the 1 is moved to the far right (length-1) position.\n\n2. Then, each subsequent row shifts the 1 one position to the left, until reaching position0.\n\n3. Then, shift the 1 to the right one position at a time until reaching the end.\n\n4. Repeat this pattern.\n\nBut let's test this with Example2.\n\nExample2's output:\n\nRow0:3 (far right)\n\nRow1:2 (left)\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1 (right)\n\nRow5:2\n\nRow6:3\n\nRow7:2 (left)\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow9:0\n\nThis matches the pattern: after reaching0 at row3, start moving right to1,2,3. But row7 is2, which is after row6 (3), so moving left again. So the pattern is:\n\n- Start at3, move left to0.\n\n- Then move right to3.\n\n- Then move left to0.\n\nBut in Example2's case, since there are 10 rows, the pattern is: 3\u21922\u21921\u21920\u21921\u21922\u21923\u21922\u21921\u21920.\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nSo the pattern for even-length arrays might be to start at the far right, move left to0, then right to end, then left again.\n\nFor Example0 (length2):\n\nStart at1 (far right), then0, then1, then0, etc.\n\nBut Example0's output starts with1 and alternates. So it fits.\n\nFor Example1 (length3):\n\nThe pattern would be:\n\nStart at2 (far right), then1, then0, then1, then2, then1, then0, etc. But in the actual Example1's output, the first row is1, not2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is conflicting. So perhaps the pattern varies based on the array length.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial direction depends on the parity of the array length. For even lengths, start at the far right and move left. For odd lengths, start at the far left +1 and move left, then right, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first step is to move the 1 to the next position in a certain direction, but the initial direction is determined by the array length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are generated by moving the 1 in a cycle that starts from the initial position and alternates direction each time an end is reached.\n\nBut for the test input, which is a 5-element array (length5). The input's last row is [1,0,0,0,0], initial position0.\n\nFollowing the pattern from Example2 (length4), the first output row would be position4 (far right). Then move left to3,2,1,0. Then move right to1,2,3,4. Then move left to3,2,1,0. But the test input has 10 rows. Let's see:\n\nRow0:4\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:2\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:2\n\nRow7:3\n\nRow8:4\n\nRow9:3\n\nBut wait, the test input has 10 rows, so:\n\nAfter row4 (position0), we move right to1 (row5), 2 (row6),3 (row7),4 (row8), then left to3 (row9). So the output rows would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,1]\n\n[0,0,0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0,0,0]\n\n[1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,1]\n\n[0,0,0,1,0]\n\nWhich would correspond to positions4,3,2,1,0,1,2,3,4,3.\n\nBut looking back at Example2, the movement after row3 (0) is to1,2,3, then2,1,0. So perhaps for length5, the pattern is to go from0\u21924\u21923\u21922\u21921\u21920\u21921\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21923.\n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, the test input's output would follow the same pattern as Example2. Let's try to write out the positions for the test case (5 elements):\n\nThe movement would be:\n\nRow0:4 (far right)\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:2\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:2\n\nRow7:3\n\nRow8:4\n\nRow9:3\n\nSo the output rows would have the 1 at positions4,3,2,1,0,1,2,3,4,3.\n\nTranslating to arrays:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,1,0]\n\nThis matches the pattern of moving from4 down to0, then up to4, then down to3. But the test case has 10 rows, so it ends at position3. This matches the pattern observed in Example2, where the last row is the initial position0. But in the test case, the initial position is0, but the last row of the output would be position3, which doesn't match. However, in Example2, the last row is position0 (input's initial position). So perhaps there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output starts at the far right and moves left to0, then right to the far end, then left to0 again, and so on. For the test input with 5 elements, this would generate the positions as follows:\n\n0:4\n\n1:3\n\n2:2\n\n3:1\n\n4:0\n\n5:1\n\n6:2\n\n7:3\n\n8:4\n\n9:3\n\nWhich matches the above.\n\nBut in Example2, the last row is0, which is the initial position. So for the test input, the last row would be position3, but the initial position is0. So perhaps the pattern continues beyond the test input's length, but since we only have 10 rows, it ends at position3.\n\nTherefore, the final output for the test input would be the 10 rows as listed above.\n\nSo the answer would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of rows, all zeros except the last row which has a 1 followed by zeros. The output seems to be a transformation where this 1 is moving in some pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has 10 rows of [0,0] except the last which is [1,0]. The output alternates between [0,1] and [1,0] for each row. Wait, except the first output row is [0,1], then [1,0], and so on. So maybe it's like a wave pattern, swapping the positions each row. But why does it alternate like that?\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input is 10 rows of [0,0,0] and the last is [1,0,0]. The output starts with [0,1,0], then [1,0,0], then [0,1,0], then [0,0,1], etc. Hmm. It seems like the 1 is moving right and left in a pattern. Maybe each row in the output is a shift of the previous, but not exactly. Let's see the positions of 1s in each output row of Example 1:\n\nRow 0: position 1 (0-based index 1)\nRow 1: position 0\nRow 2: position 1\nRow 3: position 2\nRow 4: position 1\nRow 5: position 0\nRow 6: position 1\nRow 7: position 2\nRow 8: position 1\nRow 9: position 0\n\nSo the movement is 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0. So it's oscillating between moving left and right. Like, starting from position 0 (since the last input row is [1,0,0], which in output is [1,0,0] in row 9. Wait, no, the output's last row (row9) is [1,0,0]. So maybe the initial position is 0 (the last row of input is [1,0,0], which becomes the last output row as [1,0,0]. Then the output rows above it start a pattern that moves the 1 back and forth, increasing the distance each time?\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is a reflection of some sort. Let's check Example 2. Input is 4-element rows. The last input row is [1,0,0,0], and the output's last row is [1,0,0,0]. The output rows above it start moving the 1 to the right, then left, etc. Let's see the positions of 1 in each output row for Example 2:\n\nRow0: position 3 (0,0,0,1)\nRow1: position 2 (0,0,1,0)\nRow2: position 1 (0,1,0,0)\nRow3: position 0 (1,0,0,0)\nRow4: position 1 (0,1,0,0)\nRow5: position 2 (0,0,1,0)\nRow6: position 3 (0,0,0,1)\nRow7: position 2 (0,0,1,0)\nRow8: position 1 (0,1,0,0)\nRow9: position 0 (1,0,0,0)\n\nSo the pattern here is 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0. So it's like a triangle wave going from right to left, then back to the right, but then again to left. Wait, how does this sequence go? From 3 down to 0, then up to 3 again, but then back down to 0 again? Let me list them again:\n\nRow0:3\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:2\n\nRow6:3\n\nRow7:2\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow9:0\n\nSo it's 3,2,1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0. That's a wave that starts at 3, goes down to 0, then up to 3, then down to 0 again. But since there are 10 rows, the sequence repeats after a certain point. Wait, but 3 to 0 is 4 steps, then 0 to 3 is 3 steps, then 3 to 0 again. Hmm, perhaps the pattern is a reflection where each row alternates the position of 1 in a way that mirrors the position from the bottom up. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 2 elements. The output rows are alternating between [0,1] and [1,0], starting with [0,1] for the first output row. The input's last row is [1,0], which becomes the last output row [1,0]. Then the rows above alternate. So row0 of output is [0,1], row1 [1,0], row2 [0,1], etc. So for even-numbered output rows (starting from 0), it's [0,1], odd-numbered are [1,0]. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's last row (which is the only one with a 1) and then for each row above, shifting the 1's position in some way. Like, for the 2-element case, the 1 alternates between positions 0 and 1 for each row. But since the input's last row is [1,0], which in the output is [1,0], then the row above that (row8) in the output is [0,1], then row7 is [1,0], etc. So it's a back-and-forth pattern.\n\nSimilarly, in the 3-element case, the 1 starts at position0 in the last row (output row9 is [1,0,0]). Then row8 is [0,1,0], row7 [1,0,0], row6 [0,1,0], row5 [0,0,1], row4 [0,1,0], row3 [1,0,0], row2 [0,1,0], row1 [0,0,1], row0 [0,1,0]. Wait, that doesn't exactly match the example. Let me check Example1's output again.\n\nExample1's output:\n\nRow0: [0,1,0]\n\nRow1: [1,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,1,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,1]\n\nRow4: [0,1,0]\n\nRow5: [1,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,1,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,1]\n\nRow8: [0,1,0]\n\nRow9: [1,0,0]\n\nSo the positions are:\n\nRow0:1\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\nRow7:2\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow9:0\n\nSo the pattern here is 1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0. It alternates between moving left and right. Like, from the initial position 0 (row9), then row8 is 1, row7 is 0, row6 is1, row5 is2, row4 is1, row3 is0, row2 is1, row1 is2, etc. Wait, maybe the direction alternates each step. Starting from position0, then the next row (row8) moves to 1 (right?), then row7 moves left to 0, then row6 moves right to1, row5 moves right again to2? Wait, but row5 is 0. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by a pattern that moves the 1 in a certain direction each row, reversing direction when the edge is hit. For example, in the 4-element case (Example2), the 1 starts at position0 (row9). Then row8 is position1, row7 position2, row6 position3, row5 position2, row4 position1, row3 position0, row2 position1, row1 position2, row0 position3. Wait, no. Let me check the positions again for Example2:\n\nRow0:3\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:2\n\nRow6:3\n\nRow7:2\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow9:0\n\nSo it's going from 3 (row0) down to 0 (row3), then up to 3 (row6), then down to0 (row9). But how does that correspond to the input? The input's last row is [1,0,0,0], which in the output is row9: [1,0,0,0]. Then the rows above (row8 to row0) form a pattern that starts moving the 1 to the right (row8: position1), row7 position2, row6 position3, then row5 position2, row4 position1, row3 position0, row2 position1, row1 position2, row0 position3. Wait, but that doesn't exactly fit. Maybe the movement is a reflection where each row alternates direction. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are generated by mirroring the position of the 1 from the bottom up. For example, in the 4-element case, the last row (row9) is position0. The row above (row8) is position1, then row7 position2, row6 position3. Then row5 is position2, row4 position1, row3 position0, row2 position1, row1 position2, row0 position3. So it's like a wave that goes up to the end (position3) and then back down. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's see the length of the output rows. For a 2-element input, the output rows alternate between positions 0 and 1. For 3 elements, positions cycle between 0,1,2, but in a pattern that goes back and forth. For 4 elements, it's 0,1,2,3, then back.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that each row in the output is a shifted version based on the row's index. For example, for the 4-element case, the output rows are:\n\nRow0:3 \u2192 distance from bottom is 9 (since row0 is the top, row9 is the bottom). So 9 - 0 =9. Hmm, but how does 9 relate to position3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row's 1 is placed at a position determined by (row index) modulo something. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0, 2 elements:\n\nRow indices (0-9). Output positions for 1 are:\n\n0:1 (row0)\n\n1:0 (row1)\n\n2:1 (row2)\n\n3:0 (row3)\n\n...\n\nSo for row i, if i is even, position1; if odd, position0. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nWait, but the input's last row (row9) is [1,0], which becomes the output's row9 [1,0]. Then the output rows are generated from the bottom up, starting from the last row's position and alternating each step. So row9 is [1,0], row8 would flip to [0,1], row7 flip again to [1,0], etc. So alternating each row. That fits with Example0.\n\nIn Example1, the last row (row9) is [1,0,0]. The output's row9 is [1,0,0]. Then row8 is [0,1,0], row7 [1,0,0], row6 [0,1,0], row5 [0,0,1], row4 [0,1,0], etc. Hmm, this seems like after the first flip, there's a pattern where after two steps, the 1 moves right. Maybe the direction alternates after a certain number of steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each row above the last alternates between moving the 1 to the left and right, creating a wave-like pattern. For example, in the 3-element case:\n\nStarting from row9 (position0), row8 moves right to position1. Then row7 moves left to position0. Then row6 moves right to position1. Then row5 moves right again to position2. Then row4 moves left to position1. Then row3 moves left to position0. Then row2 moves right to position1. Then row1 moves right to position2. Then row0 moves left to position1. Wait, but the positions in Example1's output are:\n\nRow9:0\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow6:1\n\nRow5:2\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow0:1\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the movement direction changes each time. Like, starting from row9 (position0), row8 moves right to 1. Then row7 moves left to 0. Then row6 moves right to1. Then row5 moves right to2. Then row4 moves left to1. Then row3 moves left to0. Then row2 moves right to1. Then row1 moves right to2. Then row0 moves left to1. But this doesn't fit because row5 is 2, row4 is1, row3 is0, row2 is1, row1 is2, row0 is1. But in Example1's output, row0 is [0,1,0] (position1). So this seems to fit. But why does the movement direction change? Maybe after reaching the end (position2 for 3 elements), it starts moving left, and vice versa.\n\nIn Example2 (4 elements), starting from position0 (row9), then row8 moves to1, row7 to2, row6 to3 (max position), then row5 moves back to2, row4 to1, row3 to0, then row2 to1, row1 to2, row0 to3. So after reaching the end (position3), it moves back, then after reaching 0, it moves forward again.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: starting from the last row (position0 for 4 elements), then each subsequent row (moving upwards) moves the 1 to the right until the end, then left until the beginning, then right again, etc. So it's a bouncing pattern between the ends of the array.\n\nIf this is the case, then for a 5-element test input, the output should start from position0 (last row), then each row above moves right until position4, then left back to 0, and so on.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nTest Input is 5 elements. The input's last row is [1,0,0,0,0], which in the output's row9 (last row) would be [1,0,0,0,0]. Then, moving up each row:\n\nRow9: position0\n\nRow8: position1\n\nRow7: position2\n\nRow6: position3\n\nRow5: position4\n\nRow4: position3\n\nRow3: position2\n\nRow2: position1\n\nRow1: position0\n\nRow0: position1\n\nSo the positions would be 0,1,2,3,4,3,2,1,0,1. But let's check the number of rows. The test input has 10 rows. So the 10 rows from row0 to row9.\n\nSo starting from row9 (position0), then:\n\nRow9:0\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow7:2\n\nRow6:3\n\nRow5:4\n\nRow4:3\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow0:1\n\nBut wait, there are 10 rows. Let's list them in order from row0 to row9 (but the initial movement starts at row9 and moves upwards to row0). Wait, no. The output's rows are arranged such that row0 is the top and row9 is the bottom. The input's last row is row9. So in the output, row9 is the same as input's last row (position0). Then each row above (row8, row7, etc.) shifts the 1 to the right until the end, then left.\n\nSo the movement sequence for the 5-element case would be:\n\nrow9:0\n\nrow8:1\n\nrow7:2\n\nrow6:3\n\nrow5:4\n\nrow4:3\n\nrow3:2\n\nrow2:1\n\nrow1:0\n\nrow0:1\n\nThus, the output rows would be:\n\nrow0: position1 \u2192 [0,1,0,0,0]\n\nrow1: position0 \u2192 [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nrow2: position1 \u2192 [0,1,0,0,0]\n\nrow3: position2 \u2192 [0,0,1,0,0]\n\nrow4: position3 \u2192 [0,0,0,1,0]\n\nrow5: position4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,1]\n\nrow6: position3 \u2192 [0,0,0,1,0]\n\nrow7: position2 \u2192 [0,0,1,0,0]\n\nrow8: position1 \u2192 [0,1,0,0,0]\n\nrow9: position0 \u2192 [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but according to the sequence above, row0's position would be1, row1's is0, etc. Wait, perhaps I got the row indices reversed. Let's clarify.\n\nIn the output, row0 is the first line, row9 the last. So when moving up from row9 to row0, the positions change as follows:\n\nrow9:0\n\nrow8:1\n\nrow7:2\n\nrow6:3\n\nrow5:4\n\nrow4:3\n\nrow3:2\n\nrow2:1\n\nrow1:0\n\nrow0:1\n\nSo the output rows from row0 to row9 would be:\n\nrow0: position1 \u2192 [0,1,0,0,0]\n\nrow1:0 \u2192 [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nrow2:1 \u2192 [0,1,0,0,0]\n\nrow3:2 \u2192 [0,0,1,0,0]\n\nrow4:3 \u2192 [0,0,0,1,0]\n\nrow5:4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,1]\n\nrow6:3 \u2192 [0,0,0,1,0]\n\nrow7:2 \u2192 [0,0,1,0,0]\n\nrow8:1 \u2192 [0,1,0,0,0]\n\nrow9:0 \u2192 [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut let's check if this aligns with the previous examples. For Example2 (4 elements), the positions go from 3 (row0) down to0 (row3), then up to3 (row6), then down to0 (row9). Which matches the sequence we saw earlier.\n\nSo applying this to the 5-element case, the positions would be:\n\nrow0:1 \u2192 [0,1,0,0,0]\n\nrow1:0 \u2192 [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nrow2:1 \u2192 [0,1,0,0,0]\n\nrow3:2 \u2192 [0,0,1,0,0]\n\nrow4:3 \u2192 [0,0,0,1,0]\n\nrow5:4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,1]\n\nrow6:3 \u2192 [0,0,0,1,0]\n\nrow7:2 \u2192 [0,0,1,0,0]\n\nrow8:1 \u2192 [0,1,0,0,0]\n\nrow9:0 \u2192 [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, the output in Example2 has row0 as [0,0,0,1], which is position3. But according to this pattern, the first row (row0) would be position3 for 4 elements. Which it is. So for 4 elements, the pattern starts at row9 (0), moves up to row5 (4 elements: position3), then back. So the pattern for the 5-element case would follow the same logic. Thus, the output for the test input should be as described above.\n\nSo the final output would have each row's 1 moving in a wave pattern, bouncing between the ends. Now, let's format that as per the examples.",
        "initial_response_2": "[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
