        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the training examples and find out how the input arrays are transformed into the output. Then apply that same pattern to the test input.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nIn Example 0, the inputs are a bunch of arrays with 0s, 8s, and 4s. The output is three arrays of three elements each. The outputs are [8,0,8], [0,8,0], [8,8,8]. Hmm. Let me look at the input to see where these numbers might come from. Maybe they're counting something. For instance, the number of 8s in certain positions or something related to blocks of numbers.\n\nIn Example 1, the input uses 2, 1, and 6. The output is [2,0,2], [0,2,0], [2,0,0]. Wait, in this case, the first part of the output seems to be the non-zero number (like 2 here, 8 in the first example, 3 in the third). The middle element is zero sometimes. Maybe the output is formed by looking at the positions where these numbers are present in the input arrays.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has 3 and 6. The output is [0,3,0], [0,3,3], [3,0,3]. So again, the non-zero number here is 3 and 6, but 6 isn't in the output. So maybe 6 is part of a larger structure, and the output is focusing on the other numbers (like 3 here). Wait, but in Example 0, there are 4s and 8s. The output was 8s. So perhaps the output is based on the highest number in the input, but not sure. Wait, in Example 0, the input has 4s and 8s. The output uses 8s. In Example 1, the input has 2s and 1s and 6s. Output uses 2s. In Example 2, the input has 3s and 6s. The output uses 3s. So maybe the output is based on the highest number present in the input? Let me check. In Example 0, the highest number is 8. Output uses 8. Example 1, the highest is 6, but the output uses 2. Wait, that doesn't fit. Wait, in Example 1, the output uses 2, which is another number present. Hmm. Maybe not the highest. Alternatively, the output is built from the numbers that are present in the input but not part of a larger block. For instance, in Example 0, the 8s are scattered, and the 4s form blocks. Maybe the 4s are part of some structure, and the 8s are the elements that are being counted. Similarly, in Example 1, 2s are scattered, 1s are in blocks, and 6s are in blocks. The output uses 2. So perhaps the output is constructed from the elements that are not part of larger connected blocks.\n\nWait, let's think about the structure. The input arrays seem to be 2D grids (each line is a row). Maybe each line is a row, and the pattern involves looking for certain shapes or counting elements that are isolated. For example, 8s in the first example might be arranged in a certain pattern, and the output captures that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of some transformation applied to each input array. For example, perhaps each input array is divided into sections, and the output is a compressed version. But the outputs are three lines each with three elements. So maybe the input grids are divided into 3x3 sections, and each output element represents something about each section.\n\nWait, looking at the input dimensions. Let's check the input rows' lengths. For Example 0, the first input line is [0,0,...8,0,0,0,0], which has 24 elements. So 24 elements per row, maybe a 24-column grid. The output is 3 elements per row, three rows. So perhaps the input is divided into 8 columns per output element (24/3=8). So each output row's element is derived from 8 columns of the input row. Maybe summing, or counting non-zero in each 8-column segment. Wait, let's check Example 0's first input row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]. Split into three parts of 8 elements each.\n\nFirst part: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 sum is 0. But the output is 8,0,8. Hmm. That doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe the count of non-zero in each part. First part has 0 non-zero. Second part (next 8 elements: 0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0) \u2192 two 8s. Third part: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8 \u2192 one 8. But the output first line is [8,0,8]. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the presence of non-zero in certain positions. For example, in each third of the row, if there's a non-zero, take that value, otherwise zero. Let's see:\n\nFirst third of the first input row (Example 0) is 0s except the last two elements are 8,8. Wait, maybe it's split into three parts. Let me count: 24 elements divided into three parts would be 8 each. So first part: elements 0-7 (all zeros). Second part: elements 8-15: 8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 two 8s. Third part: elements 16-23: 0,0,0,0,0,0,8. So maybe the output is taking the sum of each third. But sum of first third is 0, second is 16 (8+8), third is 8. But the output is [8,0,8]. Not matching. Alternatively, the maximum value in each third. First third: 0. Second: 8. Third:8. So [0,8,8]. But the output is [8,0,8]. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is not derived per row but per column. The input has multiple rows, and the output is three rows, each with three elements. Let me think of the input as a grid. For example, in Example 0, the input has 20 rows (from the INPUT lines). Each row is 24 elements. The output is three rows. So maybe each output row is aggregating multiple input rows. For example, the input is divided into groups of rows, and each group is transformed into an output row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is determined by certain positions in the input grid. For example, the corners or the center. Let's look at Example 0's output:\n\nOutput is:\n\n[8, 0, 8]\n\n[0, 8, 0]\n\n[8, 8, 8]\n\nWhich looks like a frame around the center. Maybe the input's central region is being transformed into this. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the positions of the numbers in the input. For example, in Example 0, the 8s are placed in certain positions that correspond to the output's 8s. For instance, if the input is a grid, and the output is a smaller grid that captures the positions where the numbers are present in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of certain quadrants. Let's imagine that the input is divided into 3x3 regions, and each output element is the sum of a region. But this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the output is a 3x3 grid, and each element in the output corresponds to a specific pattern in the input. For example, each output row is derived from a particular row in the input. Let me check the input and output rows for Example 0.\n\nExample 0's input has 20 rows, output has 3 rows. So maybe each output row is a combination of several input rows. For example, the first output row [8,0,8] might be derived from the first few input rows, looking for 8s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking the positions of the non-zero elements in the input and compressing them into a 3x3 grid. For example, in the first example, there are 8s in positions that when mapped to a 3x3 grid would form the pattern seen in the output.\n\nAnother approach: look at the test input. The test input has numbers 4 and 8. Following the previous examples, the output should probably use 4, since 4 is the non-block number. Wait, in Example 0, 4s form blocks (like lines of 4s), and 8s are scattered. The output uses 8s. In Example 1, 2s are scattered, 1s and 6s are blocks. Output uses 2s. In Example 2, 3s are scattered and 6s form blocks. Output uses 3s. So maybe the pattern is that the output uses the number that is not part of a large block (like 4x4 blocks or other structures). So the number that's in isolated positions is the one used in the output.\n\nSo, in the test input, the 8s form blocks (like lines of 8s), and 4s are scattered. So the output would use 4s. That makes sense.\n\nNow, how to arrange the 4s into a 3x3 output. How to determine which 4s in the input correspond to which positions in the output.\n\nLooking at the training examples:\n\nIn Example 0, the output is:\n\n[8, 0, 8]\n\n[0, 8, 0]\n\n[8, 8, 8]\n\nWhich could be a diamond shape or a frame. Looking at the input for Example 0, perhaps the 8s are arranged in certain positions that when mapped to a 3x3 grid, their positions are in the corners and center. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by checking the presence of the target number (8 in Ex0) in specific positions in the input rows. For example, the first output row checks three specific positions across the input rows. But how to map 24 columns to 3 positions.\n\nAnother idea: Each output element is the count of non-zero (target number) in specific columns of the input. For example, the first output element is the number of times 8 appears in columns 0-7, the second in 8-15, and third in 16-23. But in Example 0's first input row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]. Split into three parts (columns 0-7: all zeros, columns 8-15: two 8s, columns 16-23: one 8. So sum would be 0, 2, 1. But the first output row is [8,0,8], which doesn't match. So this idea is probably wrong.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the positions where the target number (like 8) appears in each row, and the output is the count of rows where the target appears in certain regions. For example, each output row represents a vertical slice of the input grid. For example, if the input is divided into three vertical sections, and each output row corresponds to the presence of the target number in that vertical section across the rows. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of overlaying all the input rows and counting the maximum or presence in certain positions. But given that each input is a grid of rows and columns, perhaps each output cell is determined by whether a certain cell in the input grid is non-zero (for the target number) across all rows. For example, if any row has the target number in a particular column, that's marked in the output. But how does that form a 3x3 grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking for the positions of the target number in the first, middle, and last third of each row, and then aggregating that information into the output. For example, if in a certain row, the target number is present in the first third, then that contributes to the first output column. But again, not sure.\n\nLet me look at the second example, Example 2:\n\nInput has 3s and 6s. The output is:\n\n[0,3,0]\n\n[0,3,3]\n\n[3,0,3]\n\nSo three rows, three elements each. The output uses 3s, the scattered number.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 2, maybe the 3s are in certain positions that correspond to the output. For instance, the first output row's middle element is 3, which might mean that in the first third of the input rows, the middle third has a 3. But this is vague.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the input as a 2D grid. For each example, the output is a 3x3 grid. The transformation might be that each cell in the output grid represents the presence of the target number in a particular region of the input grid. For example, the input grid is divided into 3x3 regions, and each output cell is 1 (or the number itself) if the target number appears in that region. But how?\n\nWait, the input grids vary in size. Example 0's input has 20 rows of 24 columns. Example 1 has 23 columns and 22 rows. Example 2 has 23 columns and 24 rows. The test input has 26 columns and 22 rows. So the grid sizes vary, but the output is always 3x3. So the pattern can't be based on fixed regions. Maybe the output is determined by some aspect of the positions of the target numbers relative to the entire grid.\n\nAnother idea: The output is a 3x3 grid where each cell represents the presence of the target number in a particular quadrant or third of the input grid. For example, top-left third, middle third, etc. But with varying grid sizes, how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by looking at the first, middle, and last occurrence of the target number in each dimension. For example, the rows are divided into three parts (left, center, right), and columns into three parts (top, middle, bottom). Then, each output cell is the presence of the target number in that section.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as representing the positions of the target number in a compressed manner. For instance, if the target number appears in the top-left, top-right, and bottom-left, bottom-right corners of the input grid, the output could be a 3x3 grid where those corners are marked.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 grid where each row corresponds to a certain pattern in the input rows. For example, each output row is derived from a set of input rows where the target number appears in specific columns.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the first row is [8,0,8]. Maybe this means that in the first third of the input rows (like the first 6 rows), the 8s are present in the first and last third of the columns. But looking at Example 0's input, the first few rows have 8s in positions 9 and 10 (0-based), which would be in the second third. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's consider that the output is formed by three rows, each representing three positions where the target number appears in the input, but in a specific order. For example, the first row of the output is the first three occurrences of the target number in the input, but that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a representation of the target number's positions in the input grid's rows, compressed into three elements per row. For instance, each output row represents a group of input rows, and each element in the output row is the count of the target number in a specific region of those input rows.\n\nAnother angle: In all training examples, the output is a 3x3 grid. Each output row has three elements. The elements are either the target number or zero. So perhaps the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell indicates whether the target number appears in a certain area of the input grid.\n\nLet's take Example 0 again. The input is 20 rows of 24 columns. The output is three rows. If we divide the input into three horizontal sections (like top 7 rows, middle 6 rows, bottom 7 rows), and each section is mapped to an output row. Then, within each section, divide each row into three vertical parts (left, middle, right), and for each part, check if there's an 8. If there's at least one 8 in that vertical part across any row in the horizontal section, the output element is 8, else 0.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nFor Example 0's first output row [8,0,8], the top section (first 7 rows) of the input:\n\nLooking at the first 7 input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,...,8,8,0,...0,8]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,...,0,8,0,...0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,8,0,...0,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,8,0,...0,8]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,0,...0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,0,...0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,0,...0,0]\n\nSo for the top section (rows 0-6), divided into three vertical parts (columns 0-7, 8-15, 16-23).\n\nIn columns 0-7: rows 2 and 3 have 8s (row 2 has 8 in position 1; row 3 has 8 in column 7). So there are 8s in this section. So the first output element would be 8.\n\nIn columns 8-15: row 0 has 8s in columns 9 and 10. Row 3 has 8 in column 7 (but 7 is in the first third?), wait columns 0-7, 8-15, 16-23. So column 7 is in the first third (0-7). So columns 8-15 in row 0: 8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0. So yes, 8s here. So second output element should be 8. But the first output row is [8,0,8]. This doesn't match. So perhaps the middle third has no 8s except row 0. But the middle section for rows 0-6 may have other 8s. Wait, this approach isn't aligning with the example outputs. Maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a minimal 3x3 grid that captures the \"shape\" formed by the target number in the input. For example, in Example 0, the 8s might form a sort of 'H' pattern when viewed in the input, which is then represented as a 3x3 grid where the corners and center are filled. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as a large grid and the output is a downsampled version where each output cell represents a block of cells in the input. For example, each output cell is the maximum value in a certain block of the input. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the input is 20 rows x 24 columns. The output is 3x3. So each output cell represents a block of roughly 6-7 rows and 8 columns.\n\nFor the first output row [8,0,8], the first block (top-left 6 rows x 8 columns) would include any 8s. Looking at the first few rows, there are 8s in row 0 (columns 9,10), row 1 (column 10), row 2 (columns 1, 18, 20), row 3 (column 7), etc. So in the first block (columns 0-7), row 2 has an 8 (column 1), row 3 has an 8 (column 7). So the first output cell would be 8. The middle block (columns 8-15) might have 8s in row 0 (columns 9,10), row 3 (column 7 is in the first third?), so maybe some 8s. But the output middle element is 0. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs again:\n\nExample 0 Output:\n\n[8, 0, 8]\n\n[0, 8, 0]\n\n[8, 8, 8]\n\nThis looks like a diamond shape. Example 1's output is:\n\n[2, 0, 2]\n\n[0, 2, 0]\n\n[2, 0, 0]\n\nWhich is a diamond but the bottom row is missing. Example 2's output:\n\n[0,3,0]\n\n[0,3,3]\n\n[3,0,3]\n\nHmm. These outputs seem to form different patterns. Maybe the pattern is related to the positions where the target number appears in the input. For example, if the target number is present in certain columns and rows, that translates to the output grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output represents the presence of the target number in the corners, edges, and center of the input grid. For example, if the input has the target number in the top-left corner, then the output's top-left is the target number. But how to map a large grid to a 3x3.\n\nAnother approach: Look for the positions of the target number in the input. For Example 0, 8 appears in various positions. The output is three rows. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, 8 appears in:\n\nRow 0: positions 9,10,23\n\nRow 1: position 10\n\nRow 2: positions 1,18,20\n\nRow 3: position 7,23\n\nRow 5: position 17\n\nRow 8: positions 14,18\n\nRow 9: position 11\n\nRow 10: position 14\n\nRow 11: positions 18,19,21,23\n\nRow 12: position 17\n\nRow 14: position 17,20\n\nRow 15: position 15,16\n\nRow 17: positions 12,16,20,22\n\nRow 19: positions 0,1,3,5,10,18\n\nNow, trying to see if these positions can be mapped to a 3x3 grid. For example, if the input grid is divided into 3x3 regions, each region corresponds to an output cell. But with 20 rows and 24 columns, it's hard to divide into 3x3 regions. Alternatively, the output's rows and columns are determined by the row and column indices modulo some number. For example, rows modulo 7, columns modulo 8.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the presence of the target number in the first, middle, and last parts of the rows and columns. For example, for each row, if the target appears in the first third, middle third, or last third of the columns, and similarly for the rows. But this is vague.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output:\n\n[8,0,8]\n\n[0,8,0]\n\n[8,8,8]\n\nThis looks like a pattern where the corners and center are 8s, and the middle edges are 0, but the bottom row is all 8s. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Each output row corresponds to a group of rows in the input, and each element in the output row indicates whether the target number is present in that group of rows and in certain columns. For example, the first output row checks the first third of the input rows for the target in the first, middle, and last third of the columns. Let's try this for Example 0.\n\nExample 0 has 20 input rows. Divided into three groups: first 7 rows, next 6, last 7.\n\nFirst group (rows 0-6):\n\nCheck columns 0-7, 8-15, 16-23 for any 8s.\n\nColumns 0-7: row 2 (position 1), row 3 (7) \u2192 yes. So first output element is 8.\n\nColumns 8-15: rows 0 (9,10), row 3 (7 is in first third), wait columns 8-15 would be positions 8 to 15. Row 0 has 8s at 9 and 10 \u2192 yes. So second output element would be 8, but the first output row is [8,0,8]. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the opposite: the first output element corresponds to the first third of the columns in the first third of the rows, middle element to middle third of columns in first third of rows, etc. But this is getting too complex.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is the number of times the target appears in a certain position relative to the rows and columns. For example, the top-left cell of the output is the number of times the target appears in the first few rows and first few columns. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 grid where each row represents a horizontal band in the input and each column represents a vertical band, and the cell is 1 (or the target number) if there's at least one occurrence in that band. For example:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- Horizontal bands: top 7 rows, middle 6 rows, bottom 7 rows.\n\n- Vertical bands: columns 0-7, 8-15, 16-23.\n\nFor each band intersection, if there's an 8 in any cell, output is 8, else 0.\n\nSo for the top band (rows 0-6) and left vertical band (cols 0-7):\n\nWe have 8s in row 2 (col 1), row 3 (col 7). So yes \u2192 8.\n\nTop band and middle vertical (cols 8-15):\n\nRows 0 (cols 9,10), row 3 (col 7 is in left band). So yes \u2192 8, but output is 0. Hmm, this doesn't match. So this idea is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical bands are divided into three equal parts. For 24 columns, each band is 8 columns. Then for the top band (rows 0-6) and middle vertical band (cols 8-15):\n\nRow 0 has 8s in cols 9 and 10 \u2192 middle band. So yes, so output cell should be 8. But in Example 0's first output row, the middle element is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's try to find a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output has three rows, each with three elements, which makes me think of a 3x3 grid. The numbers used in the output are the ones that are not part of the larger blocks. For example, in Example 0, 4s form 4x4 blocks, so the output uses 8s which are scattered. So the target number for the output is the one that is not part of large contiguous blocks.\n\nNow, the output's structure: For Example 0, the output is:\n\nRow 0: 8,0,8\n\nRow 1: 0,8,0\n\nRow 2: 8,8,8\n\nThis looks like a diamond shape in the first two rows and a full bottom row. Maybe this corresponds to the positions of the target number in the input grid. For example, the 8s are arranged in a way that when compressed into a 3x3 grid, they form this pattern.\n\nBut how to translate the positions of 8s in the input to the output's positions.\n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by looking at the first three occurrences of the target number in the input grid and mapping them to the output's positions. For example, the first occurrence is top-left, second in top-right, third in center, etc. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother angle: The output is the result of a cellular automaton or some transformation that detects edges or corners of the target number's positions. For example, the output's corners are 8s if the input's corners have 8s. But in Example 0's input, does the top-left corner (row 0, column 0) have an 8? No, it's 0. So this idea is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a summary of the target number's positions in the input's rows. For example, each output row represents a group of input rows, and each output column represents whether the target appears in the first, middle, or last third of those rows.\n\nFor Example 0's first output row [8,0,8], it would mean that in the first group of input rows, the target appears in the first and last third of the columns but not the middle. Looking at the first few rows:\n\nRow 0: 8s in columns 9,10 (middle third) and 23 (last third). So middle and last. So the output would have 0 and 8. But the first output element is 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by taking the sum of the target number in each third of each row and then for each third, if the sum is non-zero, put the target number, else 0. But then for each row in the output, it's the aggregation of multiple input rows.\n\nFor Example 0's first output row:\n\nEach input row is split into three parts. For each part, if there's any 8, sum is non-zero.\n\nFor example, take the first seven input rows (group 1), and for each row's three thirds, check if any have 8. Then, for each third across the group, if any row has 8 in that third, output 8.\n\nGroup 1 (rows 0-6):\n\nFor each third:\n\nFirst third (cols 0-7): row 2 has 8 in column 1, row 3 has 8 in column 7. So yes \u2192 8.\n\nSecond third (cols 8-15): row 0 has 8s in 9,10. So yes \u2192 8.\n\nThird third (cols 16-23): row 0 has 8 in 23, row 2 has 8 in 18,20. So yes \u2192 8.\n\nSo the output for group 1 would be [8,8,8], but the actual output is [8,0,8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Maybe the output is determined by the number of times the target appears in each third across all rows. For example, if the count is even or odd. But not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's consider that the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to a specific pattern in the input. For example, each output cell is the target number if there's a certain condition met in the input, like a cross or diagonal.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the center cell is 8. Maybe this corresponds to the input having 8s in the center region. But the input's center is varied.\n\nAnother idea: The output is constructed by looking for the target number in three specific rows and three specific columns of the input. For example, the output's first row is the target numbers from row 0, columns 0, 8, 23. But in Example 0's row 0, columns 0 is 0, 8 is 0, 23 is 8 \u2192 [0,0,8], which doesn't match the output [8,0,8].\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first, middle, and last elements of certain rows. For example, the first output row is the first, middle, and last elements of the first input row. But in Example 0's first input row, first is 0, middle (12th element) is 0, last is 8 \u2192 [0,0,8]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by three input rows, selected based on some criteria. For example, the first output row is the first, middle, and last elements of the first input row that contains the target number. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not found a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for a different angle. Let's think about the output as a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to a specific rule based on the input's structure. For example:\n\n- The top-left cell is the target number if the input's first row contains the target.\n- The top-right cell is the target number if the last row contains the target.\n- The center cell is the target number if the middle row contains the target.\n- Etc.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, the first row has 8s, the last row (row 19) has 8s. The middle row (row 10) has 8 in column 14. So the output's top-left and top-right would be 8, and center 8. But the output's first row is [8,0,8], and second row is [0,8,0]. So this doesn't align.\n\nAnother approach: The output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is the target number if the corresponding cell in the input's center 3x3 grid is the target. But the input's size varies, so this is unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is the target number if there's a occurrence of the target in a specific quadrant of the input. For example, top-left quadrant, top-middle, top-right, etc. But again, varying input sizes make this difficult.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling to find a pattern, perhaps I should look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern there, then work backwards.\n\nTest input has 4 and 8. Following previous examples, the output should use 4, as it's the scattered number (8 is in blocks of 4 or 8). So the output should be a 3x3 grid with 4s and 0s.\n\nNow, the test input's 4s are in various positions. Let's look for where they are.\n\nLooking at the test input rows:\n\nRow 0: 4 at position 21.\n\nRow 1: 4 at positions 3, 10, 23.\n\nRow 2: 4 at positions 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20.\n\nRow 3: 4 at positions 4, 9, 12.\n\nRow 4: 4 at position 19.\n\nRow 6: 4 at position 22.\n\nRow 7: 4 at positions 21, 23.\n\nRow 9: 4 at positions 15, 16.\n\nRow 13: 4 at position 25.\n\nRow 14: 4 at position 19.\n\nRow 15: 4 at positions 5, 19.\n\nRow 16: 4 at positions 3, 4, 5, 10, 15.\n\nRow 18: 4 at positions 4, 13, 16, 20, 25.\n\nRow 19: 4 at position 8, 10, 13.\n\nRow 21: 4 at positions 11, 14, 15, 20.\n\nNow, to form a 3x3 output with 4s where certain conditions are met. Looking for a pattern in how the 4s are distributed.\n\nIf the output's rows represent groups of input rows, and the columns represent groups of input columns. For example, each output row corresponds to a third of the input rows, and each output column to a third of the input columns.\n\nThe test input has 22 rows and 26 columns. So:\n\nRows divided into three parts: first 7 rows (0-6), next 7 (7-13), last 8 (14-21).\n\nColumns divided into three parts: first 8 (0-7), next 9 (8-16), last 9 (17-25).\n\nThen, for each output cell, check if there's a 4 in the corresponding section.\n\nLet's check:\n\nTop-left cell: first 7 rows (0-6) and first 8 columns (0-7).\n\nLooking for 4s in rows 0-6, columns 0-7:\n\nRow 1: column 3.\n\nRow 3: column 4.\n\nRow 4: no.\n\nSo there are 4s \u2192 output cell is 4.\n\nTop-middle cell: first 7 rows, columns 8-16:\n\nRow 2: columns 8,13.\n\nRow 3: columns 9,12.\n\nRow 6: column 22 is outside 8-16.\n\nSo yes, 4s present \u2192 4.\n\nTop-right cell: first 7 rows, columns 17-25:\n\nRow 0: column 21.\n\nRow 1: column 23.\n\nRow 2: columns 17-20.\n\nSo yes \u21924.\n\nSo the top row would be [4,4,4]. But this doesn't match the previous examples' outputs, which have varying patterns.\n\nBut the previous examples' outputs have varying patterns. For instance, Example 1's output has [2,0,2], [0,2,0], [2,0,0].\n\nThis approach would give all 4s in the top row, but the actual output might be different. Maybe the test output is:\n\n[4, 0, 4]\n\n[0, 4, 0]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nBut this is a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the output is based on whether the number appears in specific positions. For example, the first output row is the first, middle, and last occurrence of the target number in the entire input.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by the first three occurrences of the target number in the first, middle, and last third of the input rows. For example:\n\nFirst output row: 4 appears in column 3 (row 1), which is in the first third of columns (0-8). Second element: 4 in middle third (9-17). Third element: 4 in last third (18-25). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each output row represents a group of rows, and each element in the row represents whether there's a 4 in the corresponding third of the columns.\n\nFor example:\n\nFirst output row (rows 0-6):\n\nColumns 0-8: 4 in row 1 (3), row 3 (4) \u2192 yes \u21924.\n\nColumns 9-17: 4 in row 2 (8,13), row3 (9,12) \u2192 yes \u21924.\n\nColumns 18-25: 4 in row0 (21), row1 (23), row2 (17-20) \u2192 yes \u21924.\n\nSo the first output row would be [4,4,4], but looking at the training examples, none of the first output rows are all filled. So this seems unlikely.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by looking for the presence of the target number in specific rows and columns. For example, the output's first row is based on the presence of 4 in the first, middle, and last columns of the first row of the input. But in the test input's first row, the 4 is in column 21 (last third), so output would be [0,0,4]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by taking the first three rows of the input that contain the target number and then taking the first, middle, and last occurrence of the target in each of those rows.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nFirst three rows with 4s are row 0 (column 21), row1 (columns3,10,23), row2 (columns8,13,17,18,19,20).\n\nFirst output row: first occurrence in row0: column21 \u2192 last third \u2192 output element 4.\n\nRow1: first occurrence in column3 \u2192 first third \u2192 4. Middle occurrence in column10 (middle third \u2192 4. Last occurrence in column23 \u2192 last third \u21924.\n\nRow2: first occurrence in column8 \u2192 middle third \u21924. So the output would be:\n\n[4 (from row0), 4 (row1), 4 (row1)]\n\n[4 (row1), 4 (row2), 4 (row1)]\n\nBut this is not matching any pattern from the examples.\n\nGiven that I'm not making progress, I think I need to look for another pattern. Perhaps the output is the result of some bitwise operation or transformation that's not obvious. Alternatively, it's possible that each output cell is the sum of the target number's occurrences in a particular diagonal of the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be related to the number of times the target number appears in each of the three vertical sections of the input rows, summed across all rows. For example:\n\nFor the test input's 4s:\n\nCount in first third (columns 0-8):\n\nRows 1 (3), 3 (4), 16 (3,4,5), 18 (4), etc. So count is multiple \u2192 sum is high. But the output elements are the target number if the count is non-zero. So first output element would be 4.\n\nBut this would give all 4s, which doesn't match examples.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is the transpose of some feature of the input. For example, if the input has certain columns that are non-zero, the output rows are those columns' information. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and not found a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nIn all examples, the output's first row has the target number in the first and third positions, the second row in the middle, and the third row varies. For Example 0: first row [8,0,8], second [0,8,0], third [8,8,8]. Example1: [2,0,2], [0,2,0], [2,0,0]. Example2: [0,3,0], [0,3,3], [3,0,3]. \n\nIt looks like the output is constructed by some rotational or symmetric pattern. For instance, Example0's output is symmetric, Example1's is symmetric but the third row is different, Example2's is asymmetric.\n\nPerhaps the output is formed by taking the first three occurrences of the target number in the input and placing them in the first row, next three in the second, etc., but this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the output is based on the positions of the target number in the input's first, middle, and last row. For example, in the first row of the input, if there's a target number in the first third, middle third, or last third of columns, that determines the first output row.\n\nIn the test input's first row (row0), the 4 is in column21 (last third), so first output row would be [0,0,4]. Middle row (row10) has 4 at position 15 (middle third) \u2192 second output row [0,4,0]. Last row (row21) has 4 at positions 11,14,15,20 \u2192 which are in middle and last thirds \u2192 third output row [0,4,4]. But this doesn't match any previous example.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by the first occurrence of the target in each third of the columns across all rows, then the second occurrence, etc. For example:\n\nFirst output row: first occurrence in first third, first in middle third, first in last third.\n\nSecond output row: second occurrence in each third.\n\nThird: third occurrence.\n\nFor the test input's 4s:\n\nFirst occurrences in each third:\n\nFirst third (columns 0-8): row1, column3.\n\nMiddle third (9-17): row1, column10.\n\nLast third (18-25): row0, column21.\n\nSo first output row: [4,4,4].\n\nSecond occurrences:\n\nFirst third: row3, column4.\n\nMiddle third: row2, column8.\n\nLast third: row1, column23.\n\nSecond output row: [4,4,4].\n\nThird occurrences:\n\nFirst third: row16, column3.\n\nMiddle third: row2, column13.\n\nLast third: row2, column17.\n\nThird output row: [4,4,4].\n\nBut this doesn't match the examples. So this is likely incorrect.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the structure of the training examples. For the test input, since 4 is the scattered number, the output will use 4. The output structure might mimic Example0's pattern but with 4s. So:\n\n[4,0,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nBut in the test input, there are more 4s in various positions, so perhaps the bottom row is filled. Alternatively, the output could be:\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[4,0,4]\n\nBut this is just a guess. Looking back at the examples, each output has three rows. Example0's output's third row is all 8s. Example1's third row has two 2s and a 0. Example2's third row is [3,0,3].\n\nIn the test input, there are many 4s in the lower parts of the input, so perhaps the third row is all 4s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input's rows:\n\nThe 8s are in blocks (like rows 4-7, 8-11), so they are part of larger structures. The 4s are scattered. So the output should be based on 4s.\n\nThe output for the test input might be similar to Example1's output, where the third row has two 4s. Or perhaps something else.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll proceed to make a educated guess that the output for the test input is:\n\n[4,0,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nBut I need to verify if this aligns with the examples. For Example1, the third row is [2,0,0], which could be because there are two 2s in the lower part. But without a clear pattern, this is risky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the same for all examples, just using the target number. But that's not the case.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output is the sum of the target number's occurrences in each third of the rows, modulo 2. If even, 0; if odd, target number. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is determined by the presence of the target number in the first, middle, and last third of each row. For each row group (first third of rows, middle third, last third), check if the target appears in the first, middle, or last third of the columns.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nFirst third of rows (0-6):\n\nCheck for 4s in first third (columns 0-8), middle (9-17), last (18-25) of columns.\n\nIn first third: row1 has 4 at 3, row3 has 4 at4 \u2192 yes.\n\nMiddle third: row1 has 10, row2 has 8,13, row3 has9,12 \u2192 yes.\n\nLast third: row0 has21, row1 has23, row2 has17-20 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo first output row: [4,4,4].\n\nMiddle third of rows (7-13):\n\nRow7 has 21,23 \u2192 last third.\n\nRow9 has 15,16 \u2192 middle third.\n\nRow10: no 4s.\n\nRow13 has 25 \u2192 last third.\n\nSo middle output row: 4 in middle and last \u2192 [0,4,4].\n\nLast third of rows (14-21):\n\nRow14 has19 \u2192 last third.\n\nRow15 has5,19 \u2192 first and last.\n\nRow16 has3,4,5,10,15 \u2192 first and middle.\n\nRow18 has4,13,16,20,25 \u2192 first, middle, last.\n\nRow19 has8,10,13 \u2192 middle.\n\nRow21 has11,14,15,20 \u2192 middle and last.\n\nSo last output row: 4s in all thirds \u2192 [4,4,4].\n\nBut the output would be:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[0,4,4]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nWhich doesn't match any training example. So this approach is likely incorrect.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make a best guess. Based on the training examples, the output seems to form a pattern where the target number is placed in a symmetric or specific arrangement. For the test input, perhaps:\n\n[4,0,4]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nThis matches Example0's output structure. So I'll go with this.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of lists (rows of numbers), and the output is a list of three lists. Each example's input seems to have a certain number, like 8 in the first example, 2 in the second, 3 in the third, and the outputs are made up of those numbers.\n\nLet's take Example 0. The input has a lot of 8s and 4s. The output is three rows: [8,0,8], [0,8,0], [8,8,8]. Wait, that looks like a pattern. Maybe it's forming some kind of shape. The first line is 8, then 0, then 8. The second is 0,8,0. Third is all 8s. That's similar to a vertical line maybe? Or maybe a diamond shape?\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has 2s and 1s, 6s. The output is [2,0,2], [0,2,0], [2,0,0]. Hmm, not the same as the first example. Wait, maybe the output is the positions of certain numbers arranged in a specific way. Like, maybe the output represents the presence of the number (like 8, 2, 3) in certain positions of the input grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation of the input where certain patterns are condensed. For example, the output could be the maximum values in certain regions or columns. Or maybe it's related to how the numbers are grouped in the input.\n\nAnother angle: in Example 0, the output has three rows. The input has 20 rows, but the output is 3. So maybe each output row is aggregating some information from multiple input rows. Let's look at the input rows for Example 0. The first input row has two 8s towards the end. The output's first row is [8,0,8]. Maybe each output row is taking the first, middle, and last occurrence of the number in each input row? But that might not fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output: the three rows are of length 3. The input has varying row lengths, but maybe the output is a 3x3 grid. The numbers in the output could be the presence of the target number (like 8) in specific positions. For instance, maybe the output is constructed by taking the leftmost, center, and rightmost elements from certain rows in the input that contain the target number. But I need to check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first input row is [0,0,...,8,8,0...]. The first 8 is at position 9 (0-indexed?), maybe. If the output is taking the leftmost, middle, and rightmost occurrence of 8 in each row, but how do they combine into three rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of the target number in the input. For example, in Example 0, the 8s might form a certain pattern when plotted in their positions across the input grid, and the output is a simplified 3x3 version of that.\n\nWait, another thought: in each example, the output rows are 3 elements long, which could correspond to columns. Maybe the output is grouping the input into sections and counting the presence of the target number in each section.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output: [8,0,8], [0,8,0], [8,8,8]. That looks like a vertical line in the middle and then a filled bottom row. Maybe the input's 8s are arranged such that when divided into three parts horizontally, the left, center, and right parts have certain counts or presence of 8s, which are then represented in the output rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell represents the presence of the number in certain quadrants of the input. For example, the first row of the output could be left, middle, right of the top third of the input; second row middle third; third row bottom third. Then, if there's at least one occurrence of the number in that section, it's marked, else 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0. The input has 20 rows. Divided into three parts: top 7 rows, middle 6, bottom 7. In the top rows, maybe there's 8s in the left and right sections (the first input row has 8s near the end), so the first output row would be [8,0,8]. The middle rows might have an 8 in the center, leading to [0,8,0]. The bottom rows have 8s in all sections, leading to [8,8,8]. That seems plausible.\n\nIn Example 1, the output is [2,0,2], [0,2,0], [2,0,0]. Let's see. The input has 23 rows. Divided into three sections: top 7 rows (maybe 7,7,9?), middle, and bottom. The top might have 2s on the left and right, middle has 2 in the center, bottom has 2 on left but not right. Maybe that's how it works.\n\nExample 3's output is [0,3,0], [0,3,3], [3,0,3]. Let's see. The input has 24 rows. Divided into three parts. The top third (8 rows) might have 3 in the middle. Middle third (8 rows) has 3 in middle and right. Bottom third has 3 on left and right. That could fit.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: split the input rows into three roughly equal parts (top, middle, bottom). For each part, check each third of the columns (left, middle, right) for the presence of the target number. If the target number (like 8, 2, 3, 4) is present in that third, then output the number in that position; otherwise 0.\n\nSo for each of the three row groups (top, middle, bottom), we check the left third, middle third, and right third of the columns. If any cell in that third has the target number, then the output cell is the target number, else 0.\n\nThe target number is probably the highest number in the input, except for 0. In Example 0, 8 is the highest. In Example 1, 2 is the highest (since there's 6, but in the output, they use 2. Wait, example 1's input has 2,1,6. The output uses 2, so maybe the target is the highest non-zero number that's not part of a larger block. Wait, but in example 1, the output uses 2, but there are 6s. Hmm. Maybe the target is the number that appears scattered, not in large blocks. For example, in Example 0, 8 is scattered, and 4 is in blocks. So maybe the target number is the one that's not part of the blocks (the solid 4x4 blocks in Example 0's input), but appears as individual 8s. So the output is based on the scattered number.\n\nWait, but Example 1's input has 2s and 1s and 6s. The output uses 2. The 2s are scattered, while 1s and 6s form blocks. So the target is the scattered number. So the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell represents whether the scattered number (the target) is present in that third of the rows (top, middle, bottom) and columns (left, middle, right).\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Identify the target number, which is the non-zero number that appears scattered (not in large contiguous blocks) in the input.\n\n2. Split the input into three row groups (top, middle, bottom). For each group:\n\n3. Split each row into three column groups (left, middle, right). For each of the three sections (left, center, right in columns):\n\n4. If any cell in that section of the current row group contains the target number, then the corresponding position in the output is the target number; else 0.\n\nBut how to split the rows and columns? For example, if the input has 24 rows, each third is 8 rows. If the input has 23 rows (Example 1), maybe the split is 7,8,8. For columns, same: split into thirds. If the column count is not divisible by three, perhaps left and right take floor and the middle takes the remainder.\n\nBut maybe the exact split isn't critical as long as the sections are roughly thirds. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nIn Example 0's input, each row has 24 elements. Split into thirds: left 8 columns, middle 8, right 8. For the top third (rows 0-7?), check each third of columns. If any 8 is present in left third (columns 0-7) of any of the top rows, then the first element is 8. Similarly for middle and right.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input rows. Let's take the first input row in Example 0:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nColumns 0-7 are all 0. Columns 8-15: positions 8-15 are 0 (since 8 is index 9 and 10, but wait indexes start at 0. Let me count:\n\nThe row is 24 elements. Columns 0-7 (indices 0-7) are 0. Columns 8-15 (indices 8-15) include the 8s at positions 9 and 10, which is in the middle third. Then columns 16-23 (indices 16-23) have an 8 at position 23. Wait, the row ends with 8. So in this row, middle third (columns 8-15) has 8s, and right third (16-23) has an 8 at the end.\n\nBut this row is part of the top third of all input rows. So in the top third of the input, for the middle column section (columns 8-15), there's an 8 here. So the top row of the output would have [8 (left?), 0 (middle?), 8 (right?)]. Wait, no. Wait the output row for the top third is [8,0,8]. So maybe in the top third of rows, the left third of columns has an 8 in any row? But in the first row of Example 0, the left third (columns 0-7) are all 0. So how does the output get 8 in the left position?\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the split. Maybe the columns are split into left, middle, right as thirds. For each row group (top, middle, bottom), check if any of the rows in that group have the target number in the left third, middle third, or right third. So for the top group, if any row in the top third has the target in the left third of columns, then the first element of the first output row is the target. Same for middle and right.\n\nWait, let's check Example 0's top group. Let's say the top third of the input is rows 0-6 (since 20 rows total in input). Looking through those rows for 8s:\n\nRow 0: [0s..., 8,8,0...], so middle third (columns 8-15) and right third (16-23) have 8s.\n\nRow 1: has 8 in middle third (position 10, column 10? Assuming 24 columns, columns 8-15 are middle third. So 8 is in middle third here.\n\nRow 2: has 8 at position 1 (left third?), then in row 2 of input, the 8 is at index 1, which is in the left third (0-7 columns). So in the top group (rows 0-6?), there's a row with an 8 in the left third (row 2), middle third (rows 0,1), and right third (row 0, which ends with 8 at position 23). Therefore, the output's first row would be [8,8,8], but the actual output is [8,0,8]. Hmm, this contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe the target number is determined first. In Example 0, the target is 8. So for each row group, check each column third for presence of 8.\n\nTop group (rows 0-6):\n\n- Left third (columns 0-7): any 8s here? Row 2 has 8 at position 1 (column 1). So yes. So first element is 8.\n\n- Middle third (columns 8-15): rows 0,1 have 8s here. So yes. Second element is 8.\n\n- Right third (columns 16-23): row 0 has 8 at position 23. So third element is 8.\n\nBut the output's first row is [8,0,8]. So this doesn't match. So maybe the approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: for each of the three row groups (top, middle, bottom), check if there's an 8 in the first third of columns (left), the middle third (middle), and the last third (right) across all rows in that group. Then, for the output row, if there's at least one 8 in the left third, middle third, or right third of that row group, then the output is 8, else 0.\n\nBut in Example 0's first output row is [8,0,8]. So for the top row group, left third has 8 (from row 2), middle third has 8 (rows 0,1, etc.), but the output's middle element is 0. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows correspond to the bottom three rows of the input. But in Example 0's input, the last three rows have 8s, but the output is three rows. Not sure.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's look at the outputs for each example:\n\nExample 0 output has 3 rows, each with 3 elements. The first row is [8,0,8], which could represent that in some top section of the input, there are 8s on the left and right but not the middle. The second row [0,8,0] would mean middle section has 8s only in the middle. Third row [8,8,8] means bottom section has 8s in all parts.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, perhaps the first output row corresponds to the first third of the input rows, checking left, middle, right for 8s. Let's check:\n\nFirst third of rows (assuming 20 rows, 20/3 \u22487 rows). Rows 0-6:\n\nLooking for 8s in left third (columns 0-7):\n\nRow 2 has an 8 at position 1 (column 1), which is in left third. So yes, left third has 8 \u2192 first element 8.\n\nMiddle third (columns 8-15):\n\nRows 0,1 have 8s in columns 8-15. So middle third has 8 \u2192 second element should be 8. But output is 0. Contradicts.\n\nHmm, maybe the column split is not exact thirds. Or perhaps the middle element is the exact center column. For example, in a 24-column row, the middle third is columns 8-15 (indices 8-15). Wait, but in that case, rows 0 and 1 have 8s in the middle third. So why is the first output row's middle element 0?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is not about presence in the row group's column thirds, but something else. Like, each output row is derived from three specific rows in the input. For example, the first output row is from the first row of the input, the middle row, and the last row. Or maybe three key rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first, middle, and last row of the input and then taking the leftmost, middle, and rightmost element from each. But in Example 0, the first input row's leftmost is 0, middle is 0, rightmost is 8. Middle input row (around row 10) perhaps has some 8s. Last row has 8s. But the output is three rows of 3 elements each, which doesn't align directly.\n\nWait, another angle. The outputs for each example have three rows. Maybe each output row corresponds to a certain layer or position in the input. For example, the first output row is the top layer, the second the middle, third the bottom. Each output row's elements are derived from the positions of the target number in that layer.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 0's output:\n\n[8,0,8]\n[0,8,0]\n[8,8,8]\n\nThis looks like a diamond shape. Maybe the input's 8s form a diamond when viewed in the grid, and the output is a 3x3 representation. Similarly, Example 1's output is [2,0,2], [0,2,0], [2,0,0], which could be a different pattern. But how to translate the input into this.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is the count of the target number in each third of the input grid. But no, counts would be higher than the target number.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the presence of the target number in certain key positions. For example, the first row of the output checks if the target is present in the top-left, top-center, top-right of the input grid. But how to define those positions.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by taking the leftmost occurrence, the middle occurrence, and the rightmost occurrence of the target number in each of three row sections.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to a quadrant of the input, but divided into 3 rows and 3 columns. For example, the input is divided into a 3x3 grid (each cell being a larger section), and the output cell is the target number if it's present in that section, else 0.\n\nSo, for Example 0's input, which is 20 rows x 24 columns:\n\nDivide into 3 rows (top 7, middle 6, bottom 7) and 3 columns (8 each). Each of the 9 sections would be a 7x8 or 6x8 area. The output 3x3 grid represents whether the target number is present in each section.\n\nBut how does this fit the output? Let's see. For Example 0, the output is:\n\nRow 0: 8,0,8 \u2192 top sections: left and right have 8s, middle doesn't.\n\nRow 1: 0,8,0 \u2192 middle row sections: only center has 8.\n\nRow 2: 8,8,8 \u2192 bottom sections: all have 8s.\n\nLooking at the input's sections:\n\nTop-left section (first 7 rows, columns 0-7): any 8s? In row 2, column 1 is 8. So yes \u2192 output[0][0] =8.\n\nTop-middle (rows 0-6, columns 8-15): rows 0,1 have 8s here. So yes \u2192 output[0][1] =8. But the actual output is 0. Hmm, contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the target is not 8 but another number. Wait, in Example 0, the input has 4s and 8s. The output uses 8. So target is 8. But why the output's first row middle element is 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is not based on the presence of the target number, but the sum or something else. Or maybe it's the parity (even/odd) of occurrences. But that seems less likely.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for patterns in the positions of the target number in the input and how they map to the output.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first row is [8,0,8]. So the first and third elements are 8. Maybe this corresponds to the first and third columns in the top third of the input having 8s.\n\nLooking at the input's top third (first 7 rows):\n\nLeft third (columns 0-7): row 2 has an 8 at column 1. So present \u2192 8.\n\nMiddle third (columns 8-15): rows 0,1, etc. have 8s here. So why output middle is 0? This is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is not about the presence of the target in the section, but whether the target is present in the exact center of each section. For example, each section's center cell is checked. But that seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first, middle, and last elements of each third of the input rows. For example, for each row group (top, middle, bottom), take the first element of the row group's first row, the middle element of the middle row, and the last element of the last row. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by looking for the target number in specific positions across all rows and columns, such as the corners and center. For example, output's first row is the first occurrence in the top-left, top-center, top-right of the input. But the input is a long list of rows, not a square matrix, so this might not fit.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is generated by counting the number of times the target number appears in each of the three vertical thirds (left, middle, right) across three horizontal sections (top, middle, bottom). If the count is non-zero, the output is the target number; otherwise 0.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nTop third (rows 0-6):\n\n- Left vertical third (cols 0-7): at least one 8 \u2192 8.\n\n- Middle third (cols 8-15): yes \u2192 8.\n\n- Right third (cols 16-23): yes (row 0 has 8 in last position).\n\nSo output first row should be [8,8,8], but actual output is [8,0,8]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's not vertical thirds, but horizontal. Like, for each row group (top, middle, bottom), check if there's a target number in the left, middle, or right third of the entire group's rows.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the presence of the target in three key positions: leftmost column, center column, and rightmost column of each row group.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's top third (rows 0-6):\n\n- Leftmost column (col 0): any 8s? No.\n\n- Center column (col 12): any 8s? Let's see row 0: at position 9 and 10 (columns 9 and 10) have 8s, so not center.\n\n- Rightmost column (23): row 0 has 8 in col 23.\n\nSo output first row would be [0,0,8], but the actual output is [8,0,8]. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try another approach. Let's look at the Test Input.\n\nTest Input's target number is likely 4 and 8. Because in the input, there are 4s scattered and 8s in blocks. For example, rows 4-7 have 8s in blocks of 4 or 8. So the scattered number would be 4. So the output should use 4.\n\nNow, applying the pattern from the training examples, the output would be three rows, each with three elements indicating the presence of 4 in different sections.\n\nLet's assume the Test Input is divided into three row groups (top, middle, bottom). For each group, check left, middle, right thirds of columns for presence of 4.\n\nTest Input has 22 rows. So split into top 7 rows (0-6), middle 7 (7-13), bottom 8 (14-21).\n\nFor each row group, check left third (columns 0-8 (since 26 columns, thirds would be 0-8,9-17,18-25)):\n\nTop group (rows 0-6):\n\n- Left third (cols 0-8): Looking for 4s.\n\nRow 1 has a 4 at column 3. So left third has 4 \u2192 output first element is 4.\n\nMiddle third (cols 9-17): Row 2 has 4 at column 10, row 3 has 4 at column 8 (wait, columns are 0-based. Let's see:\n\nRow 1 in Test Input is [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,...]. The 4s are at columns 3 and 10. Columns 9-17: column 10 is within 9-17. So yes, middle third has 4 \u2192 second element is 4.\n\nRight third (cols 18-25): Row 0 has a 4 at column 21. So yes \u2192 third element is 4.\n\nBut according to this, the first output row would be [4,4,4], but looking at the training examples, the outputs don't always have all elements filled. For example, in Example 0's first output row, the middle element is 0 even though there are 8s in the middle third. So maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Test Input's target number is 4, and the output should be structured based on where the 4s are present in the three row groups and three column sections.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of Example 1 again. The target is 2. The output is [2,0,2], [0,2,0], [2,0,0]. Let's see if the row groups and column thirds make sense.\n\nExample 1's input has 23 rows. Splitting into three row groups: 7,8,8. Top 7 rows (0-6), middle 8 (7-14), bottom 8 (15-22).\n\nFor the top group:\n\n- Left third (cols 0-7): any 2s?\n\nRow 0 has 2 at column 2. So yes \u2192 first element 2.\n\nMiddle third (cols 8-15): row 1 has 2 at column 5. So middle third (cols 8-15?) No, column 5 is left third. Hmm, maybe the column split is different.\n\nWait, 23 columns in Example 1. So thirds would be cols 0-7 (8 cols), 8-15 (8), 16-22 (7). So in row 1, column 5 is left third. So in top group, middle third (cols 8-15) has no 2s. So middle element is 0. Right third (cols 16-22): row 1 has 2 at column 21. So right third \u2192 third element is 2. So top row is [2,0,2], which matches the output.\n\nMiddle group (rows 7-14):\n\nLooking for 2s in left third (cols 0-7), middle (8-15), right (16-22).\n\nRow 8 has a 2 at column 6 (left third?), but maybe not. Let me check. Row 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. The 2 is at column 22 (right third). So in middle group rows 7-14:\n\nLeft third: any 2s? Row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 no. Row 8: no in left third. Other rows in middle group may not have 2s in left third. So left third no \u2192 0.\n\nMiddle third: any 2s? Row 10: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0]. The 2s at column 0 (left) and column 12 (middle third), and 21 (right). So in middle group, row 10 has a 2 in middle third \u2192 middle element is 2. So output's middle row is [0,2,0], which matches.\n\nBottom group (rows 15-22):\n\nLeft third: any 2s? Row 16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 no. Row 21: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,...]. Column 4 (left third) and 11 (middle third). So left third has 2 in row 21. So left element is 2.\n\nMiddle third: any 2s? Row 21 has a 2 at column 11 (middle third) \u2192 middle element is 2. But the output's third row is [2,0,0]. So this doesn't fit. Hmm. \n\nWait, the actual output for Example 1's third row is [2,0,0]. So according to this, the bottom group's left third has a 2, middle third has 2, right third has 0. But the output is [2,0,0]. That doesn't add up. Maybe there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bottom group's right third (cols 16-22) has no 2s. Let's check row 15: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. 2s at columns 9 and 15. Columns 9 is in middle third (8-15), 15 is edge of middle third. So in row 15, column 15 is part of middle third. So right third would be cols 16-22, which in this row has no 2s. So bottom group's right third has no 2s \u2192 third element is 0. \n\nIn bottom group, left third (cols 0-7): row 21 has a 2 at column 4 \u2192 yes. Middle third (cols 8-15): row 21 has a 2 at column 11. So middle element should be 2. But output is [2,0,0]. Contradiction.\n\nSo this approach might not be correct. Perhaps the target number's presence is determined differently. Maybe it's not about any occurrence in the section, but whether the number is present in certain positions relative to others.\n\nAnother idea: the output rows correspond to the positions of the target number in the input's first, middle, and last rows. For example, the first output row is derived from the first input row, taking the first, middle, and last occurrence of the target. But in Example 0's first input row, the target (8) occurs at positions 9,10,23. So first occurrence is 9 (middle third), last is 23 (right third). Middle of the row is at position 12 (0-based, 24 columns: 0-23 \u2192 middle at 11.5, so positions 11 and 12). So first row's middle element would be 0 (since 8s are at 9,10,23). But output's first row is [8,0,8]. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output's first row is the first occurrence of the target in the input's first row, middle row, and last row. But Example 0's first row has 8s at positions 9 and 10, so first occurrence is 9 (middle third), but output's first element is 8. So maybe the left third is considered, but that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell represents the presence of the target number in the corresponding third of the input grid, split into three row groups and three column groups. Then, for the test input, the target is likely 4 (since it's scattered), and we check each section.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n\nTarget is 4 (since 8s are in blocks). The input has 22 rows. Split into top 7 rows (0-6), middle 7 (7-13), bottom 8 (14-21).\n\nColumns: 26 columns. Left third: 0-8 (9 cols), middle 9-17 (9), right 18-25 (8).\n\nFor each row group:\n\nTop group (rows 0-6):\n\n- Left third (cols 0-8): Check if any 4s in rows 0-6, cols 0-8. Row 1 has a 4 at col 3 \u2192 yes. So output[0][0] =4.\n\n- Middle third (cols 9-17): Row 1 has 4 at col 10 (row 1: [...,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0...]). So yes. So output[0][1] =4.\n\n- Right third (cols 18-25): Row 0 has 4 at col 21 \u2192 yes. So output[0][2] =4.\n\nBut according to Example 0, if there are multiple sections with the target, but the output's first row is [8,0,8], implying middle is 0. So maybe the actual rule is different. Maybe it's not presence in any part of the section, but a specific pattern, like the first and last occurrence in the row group's sections.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each row group, look at each row and see if the target appears in the left, middle, or right third of that row. If in any row of the group, the target appears in the left third, then the first element is target; similarly for middle and right.\n\nFor example, in the top group:\n\nFor each row in 0-6:\n\nCheck if the target (4) is present in the left third (cols 0-8). Row 1 has 4 in col 3 \u2192 yes. So output left is 4.\n\nCheck if any row in top group has 4 in middle third (cols 9-17). Row 1 has 4 at col 10 \u2192 yes. So middle is 4.\n\nCheck if any row in top group has 4 in right third (cols 18-25). Row 0 has 4 at 21 \u2192 yes. So output row 0 is [4,4,4]. But looking at the training examples, this doesn't match. For example, Example 1's first output row is [2,0,2], which would imply that in the top group, there are 2s in left and right thirds but not middle. But according to the input, there's a 2 in the middle (row 1, col 5). So why is the middle 0?\n\nThis suggests that my initial hypothesis is incorrect. There must be a different pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: looking for the number of occurrences. Maybe the output is the count of the target number in each section, but mapped to the target number if count is non-zero, else 0.\n\nBut in Example 0, the first output row is [8,0,8], implying that in the left and right sections of the top group, there are 8s, but middle has none. But according to the input, the middle section does have 8s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the number of rows in each section that have the target number in any position. For example, for the left third, count how many rows in the group have at least one target number in the left third. Then, if the count is even, 0; if odd, target number. But this also seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the positions of the first occurrence of the target number in each section. For example, if the first occurrence is in the left third, it's marked as target, else 0. But this also doesn't align.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to proceed, I'll make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn the Test Input, the target number is 4, which is scattered. The output should be three rows of three elements each. Following the pattern of the examples, perhaps the first row is [4,0,4], the second [0,4,0], and the third [4,4,4]. But looking at the examples, Example 0's output has a filled bottom row, so maybe the Test Input's bottom section has 4s in all thirds.\n\nBut checking the Test Input's bottom rows (14-21):\n\nRows 14-21.\n\nLooking for 4s in left third (cols 0-8):\n\nRow 14: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0...]. So 4 at 0 and 8 (column 0 and 8). Left third is 0-8, so column 0 and 8 are included. So yes.\n\nRow 15: [0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0...]. 4 at 1 and 4 (columns 1 and 4) \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 16: [0,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,4...]. 4s in left third.\n\nSo left third has 4s \u2192 output third row first element is 4.\n\nMiddle third (cols 9-17):\n\nRow 14: 4 at column 19 (right third).\n\nRow 15: 4 at column 4 (left).\n\nRow 16: 4 at columns 3,4,9 (col 9 is middle third).\n\nSo middle third has 4s \u2192 output third row middle is 4.\n\nRight third (cols 18-25):\n\nRow 14: 4 at column 25 (right third).\n\nRow 18: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0...]. 4 at column 4 (left third).\n\nRow 19: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0...]. 4 at column 8 (left third).\n\nRow 21: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]. 4s at columns 11,14,15,20 (cols 11 is middle third, 14 and 15 are middle, 20 is right third (18-25)).\n\nSo right third has 4s \u2192 output third row third element is 4.\n\nThus, the third output row would be [4,4,4]. The second row (middle group) would have 4s only in the middle if the middle section has 4s in the middle third. Let's check middle group (rows 7-13):\n\nLooking for 4s in left, middle, right thirds.\n\nLeft third (0-8):\n\nRow 7: 8s in blocks, no 4s.\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0]. 4 at column 14 (middle third), 21 (right), 23 (right).\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]. 4s at 15,16,24 (middle and right).\n\nRow 12: [0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. 4s at 1,4,9 (left and middle thirds).\n\nSo left third (0-8) in middle group: row 12 has 4 at 1 \u2192 yes. So output middle row first element is 4.\n\nMiddle third (9-17): rows 8,9,12 have 4s in middle third. So middle element is 4.\n\nRight third (18-25): rows 8,9 have 4s in right third. So third element is 4.\n\nBut according to the pattern of training examples, the middle row of the output would be [0,4,0], but this approach gives [4,4,4], which doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too ambiguous. Given the time constraints, I'll make a best-guess answer based on the examples provided. \n\nThe Test Input's output likely follows the pattern where each row of the output corresponds to the presence of the target number (4) in the left, middle, and right thirds of the input rows. Considering that, the possible output could be:\n\n[4,0,4]\n[0,4,0]\n[4,4,4]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the middle row often has the target only in the center. So for the Test Input, the middle group (rows 7-13) might have 4s only in the middle third. But from the earlier analysis, that's not the case. However, given the examples, the answer might be:\n\n[4,0,4]\n[0,4,0]\n[4,4,4]\n\nBut in Example 0, the output's first row is [8,0,8], implying that in the top group, the left and right thirds have the target, but the middle does not. Maybe the Test Input's top group has 4s in the left and right thirds but not middle. Let me recheck.\n\nTest Input's top group (rows 0-6):\n\nLeft third (cols 0-8):\n\nRow 1 has 4 at col 3 \u2192 yes.\n\nMiddle third (cols 9-17):\n\nRow 2 has 4 at col 10 \u2192 yes.\n\nRight third (cols 18-25):\n\nRow 0 has 4 at col 21 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo according to this, the first output row would be [4,4,4], but in the training examples, the first row can have 0 in the middle. So this is conflicting.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the answer that seems to fit the examples best, even if my analysis is incomplete.",
