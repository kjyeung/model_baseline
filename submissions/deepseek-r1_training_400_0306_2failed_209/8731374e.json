        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the training examples and find out how the input lists are transformed into the output lists. Then apply that same pattern to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nThe input is a bunch of lists, and the output is a list of 6 elements, with values like [1,2,1,1,2,1] or [2,2,2,2,2,2]. Hmm. Let me check the input lists. Maybe there's a recurring sequence or a specific part of the input that's being counted or transformed.\n\nWait, in Example 0's inputs, some of the lists have sequences of 1s. Like the first input list in Example 0 is [6, 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 7, 2, 6, 5, 7, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5, 9, 4, 5, 9, 3, 8, 7]. But looking at other inputs, like the third list in Example 0's input: [6, 8, 3, 1, 9, 8, 7, 1, 2, 3, 9, 2, 6, 2, 1, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 8, 1, 3]. Wait, maybe the outputs are related to sequences of 1s in the input. Let me check another input. For example, in the 5th input list of Example 0: [2, 9, 2, 3, 9, 6, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 7, 2, 4, 0, 1, 6, 4, 5]. Here, there's a sequence of six 1s. The output for this input in Example 0 is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the count of runs of 1s, but in Example 0's output, the outputs are all 6 elements. Let's see. The output for Example 0 has 7 output lists, each of length 6. Wait, but the input has 16 input lists, and the output has 7 output lists. Maybe each input list corresponds to an output list? But the numbers don't add up. Wait, in Example 0, the input lists are 17 (from 0 to 16), and the output lists are 7. Hmm, maybe each output list corresponds to a group of input lists. Not sure. Wait, the problem statement says that each example has input and output pairs. For instance, Example 0's input is a list of multiple lists, and the output is a list of lists. So perhaps each input list in the example's input is transformed into an output list, but the example's output has fewer lists. Wait, in Example 0, the input has 17 lists, and the output has 7 lists. So maybe the output is generated by processing some of the input lists, perhaps those that contain a certain pattern.\n\nWait, let's look closer. Let's take the first input list of Example 0 and see its corresponding output. Wait, the first output in Example 0 is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. But how is that derived from the input lists?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by looking for sequences of the same number in the input lists. For example, looking at Example 0's output lists, they have sequences of 1s and 2s. Maybe the output is counting the lengths of consecutive 1s in the input lists. Let's check.\n\nTake the first input list in Example 0: [6, 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 7, 2, 6, 5, 7, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5, 9, 4, 5, 9, 3, 8, 7]. There are a 1 here, but it's not part of a consecutive sequence. The next input list in Example 0: [6, 0, 1, 0, 4, 8, 6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 6, 6, 6, 5, 8, 7, 4, 1, 7, 5, 6]. Here, there are sequences of 1s. Let's see: positions 2 (1), then after that, position 7 has 1,1 (two 1s?), but wait the list is [6,0,1,0,4,8,6,1,1,2,1,2,...]. So starting at index 7 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), maybe. Wait, in this list, the 1s are at positions 2, then 7 and 8 (two consecutive 1s), then at 10, and then 19. So sequences of 1: lengths 1, 2, 1, 1. But the output for this input list is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. Hmm, not matching. Maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe the output is related to the position of a certain pattern. Let's check Example 0's output. The first output is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. The second output is the same. Third is [2,2,2,2,2,2]. Hmm. Maybe the output is derived from the count of the number 1 in certain positions. Or perhaps the presence of a specific sequence in the input list.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the counts of 1s in the input list, but grouped into certain parts. For instance, splitting the input list into chunks and counting 1s in each chunk. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the first input list in Example 0: it's length 23. If we split it into 6 chunks (since the output is 6 elements), how? 23 divided by 6 is about 3.8. Maybe each chunk is 4 elements, but 6*4=24, which is longer. Alternatively, maybe split into groups of 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3. Let's check the number of 1s in each group. The first input list of Example 0 is [6, 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 7, 2, 6, 5, 7, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5, 9, 4, 5, 9, 3, 8, 7]. Let's split into 4 elements each:\n\nGroup 1: 6,1,2,4 \u2192 1 (one 1)\nGroup 2: 8,3,7,2 \u2192 0\nGroup 3: 6,5,7,7 \u2192 0\nGroup 4:4,9,2,5 \u21920\nGroup5:9,4,5,9 \u21920\nGroup6:3,8,7 \u21920\nBut the output is [1,2,1,1,2,1], which doesn't match. Hmm. So maybe that's not the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived from the positions where there are sequences of 1s. For example, in the input lists of Example 0, perhaps some of them have a series of consecutive 1s. Let's check the fifth input list of Example 0:\n\n[2, 9, 2, 3, 9, 6, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 7, 2, 4, 0, 1, 6, 4, 5]. Here, there's a sequence of six 1s. The output for this input is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output lists are generated by looking for runs of the same number in the input lists. For example, the output counts the lengths of consecutive numbers, but only for certain numbers. Like, for each input list, find the consecutive runs of 1s and then take their lengths. Then, the output could be those lengths.\n\nBut looking at the fifth input list in Example 0, which has a run of 6 1s. But the output is [1,2,1,1,2,1], which sums to 8, but 6 is not part of that. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times a 1 appears in each of the six segments of the input list. For example, if the input list is divided into six parts, each part's count of 1s is an element in the output. Let's check.\n\nTake the fifth input list of Example 0: [2, 9, 2, 3, 9, 6, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 7, 2, 4, 0, 1, 6, 4, 5]. The length is 23. Divided into 6 parts: perhaps each part is about 4 elements (since 6*4=24, but one part would have 3). Let's see:\n\nSegments:\n\n1. 0-3: 2,9,2,3 \u2192 0 1s.\n\n2.4-7:9,6,8,8 \u21920.\n\n3.8-11:1,1,1,1 \u21924.\n\n4.12-15:1,1,9,7 \u21922 (positions 8-11 is four 1s, then 12-13 are two 1s? Wait, the original list from 8 to 15:\n\nIndices 8-11: elements 1,1,1,1 (four 1s), then 12-15: elements 1,1,9,7 (positions 12 and 13 are 1,1, so two more 1s). So total in this input list, six 1s in a row. So if divided into six segments, maybe each segment is 4 elements except the last:\n\nSegments:\n\n1: 0-3 (4 elements) \u21920.\n\n2:4-7 \u21920.\n\n3:8-11 \u21924.\n\n4:12-15 \u21922.\n\n5:16-19 \u21920,1,6,4 \u21921 (the 1 at position 19).\n\n6:20-22:5 \u21920.\n\nSo counts would be 0,0,4,2,1,0. But the output is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. Doesn't match. So that approach might not be right.\n\nWait, maybe the output isn't about the number of 1s. Looking at other examples. Let's look at Example 1's output. The output lists have elements like [4,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4]. So the numbers 4 and 1 are present, possibly indicating some pattern.\n\nIn Example 1's input lists, looking at the first input list: [3,1,8,2,5,1,9,5,0,5,1,2,4,2,9,7,4,4,5,8,6,7,6]. Are there sequences of 4s here? Not really. But maybe sequences of some other numbers. Wait, looking at another input list in Example 1, for example the seventh input list: [0,0,1,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,7,7,0,4,4,0,4,1,4]. Here, there's a long run of 4s. The output for this input in Example 1 is [4,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4]. Hmm, the output has 9 elements. Let's see if the input list has 9 segments. The input list length is 23. Divided into 9 segments: 23/9 \u2248 2.55. So maybe 3 elements per segment except some. For example, 9 segments with 2,3,2,3, etc. elements. Alternatively, maybe the output is the count of 4s in each segment. Let's check.\n\nIn the seventh input list of Example 1, which has a long run of 4s: positions 4-12 (assuming 0-based) are 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4 (nine 4s). Then output is [4,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4]. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output is the count of the number of times a certain pattern occurs. Alternatively, maybe each output element is 1 if the corresponding position in the input is a 1, but that seems unlikely.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input. The output lists are composed of 8 elements, mostly 8s and 2s. For instance, the output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8] or [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]. Looking at the input lists in Example 2, the third input list is [5,5,6,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,2,7]. There's a sequence of eight 8s here. The output for this input is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. Wait, but the input has eight 8s, then followed by 2. So maybe the output is capturing a sequence of 8s followed by a 2. But how does that translate into the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a modified version of a part of the input list. For instance, in Example 2's third input list, there's a part with 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (eight 8s), but the output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. Wait, where does the 2 come from? Looking at the input list: after the eight 8s, the next element is 2. So maybe the output takes the first eight elements of the input list, but replaces the fourth element with the next element after the run. Or something like that. Alternatively, maybe the output is the first 8 elements of the input list after a certain point. But in the third input list of Example 2, the eight 8s start at position 5 (0-based), so elements 5-12 are eight 8s. The output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. Hmm, but where does the 2 come from? The next element after the eight 8s is 2. Maybe the output is taking the first seven 8s and inserting the 2 after the third. So 8,8,8,2 followed by the remaining four 8s. That would make the output list length 8. So why? Maybe whenever there's a run of 8s followed by a 2, the output captures that by inserting the 2 into the sequence. But how is this generalized?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times a certain pattern appears. For example, in Example 2's third input list, there's a run of eight 8s, and the output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. The 2 in the fourth position could correspond to the element following the run. So the output is the first 8 elements of the run, but replacing the fourth element with the next value after the run. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking a specific substring from the input list. For example, in Example 2's input lists, those with consecutive 8s, the output is taking that sequence and modifying it. For instance, in the third input list, the run of eight 8s would be eight 8s. But the output is 8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8. Wait, the next element after the eight 8s is 2. So maybe the output is taking the first 8 elements of the run, and inserting the next element (2) at the fourth position. So positions 0-7 of the run: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. But output is 8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8. So replacing the fourth element (index 3) with 2. But why 2? Because the next element after the run is 2.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is: find the longest run of a certain number in the input list, then create an output list by taking that run, and inserting the next number after the run into a specific position. For example, in the third input list of Example 2, the longest run is eight 8s. The next element is 2. Insert 2 at position 3 (0-based) of the run. Then the output is eight elements: first three 8s, then 2, then the next four 8s. Thus the output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. If this is the case, then the output is the run with the next element inserted in the middle.\n\nBut then, how does this apply to other examples? Let's check another input from Example 2. The fifth input list in Example 2's input is [1,7,3,3,5,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,7,1,1,4]. Here, the run of 8s is at positions 5-7 (three 8s?), but after that there's a 2. Wait, but the input list is [1,7,3,3,5,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,7,1,1,4]. So the run of 8s here is three 8s (positions 5-7), then a 2, then another four 8s (positions 9-12). So two separate runs of 8s. The output for this input is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. So combining the two runs with the 2 in between? But the first run is 3 8s, the second is 4. How does that form 8 elements? Wait, the output has 8 elements. So perhaps the two runs are 3+4=7 8s, but inserting the 2 in the middle. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output is taking the longest run of 8s. But in this case, the second run is longer (4 8s). Then the next element after that run is 7. So the output would be four 8s plus inserting 7. But the output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe this line of thinking is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 2, the fourth output is [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]. Which input list corresponds to that? The fourth input list in Example 2's input is [5,2,7,3,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,4,4,6]. Here, there's a run of eight 8s. The next element is 1. But the output is all 2s. Wait, this doesn't align with the previous idea. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's output. Each output list has six elements. The outputs are either [1,2,1,1,2,1] or [2,2,2,2,2,2]. The input lists have varying lengths. Maybe the output is related to the presence of consecutive 1s in the input. For instance, in the fifth input list of Example 0's input, there's a sequence of six 1s, but the output is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the positions of certain elements. For example, in the input list, if there are sequences of 1s, and the output counts how many times 1 appears in certain positions. For example, for each output element, check if the corresponding position in the input list is a 1, then 1, else 2. But how would that produce the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking for a specific pattern of numbers in the input. For example, the output might be the digits of the count of a certain number in the input. But in Example 0's output, the outputs are [1,2,1,1,2,1], which doesn't seem to be a count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first six elements of the input list and replacing each element with 1 if it's a 1, otherwise 2. For example, take the first six elements of the input list:\n\nIn Example 0's first input list: [6,1,2,4,8,3]. The first six elements. Replace 1 with 1, others with 2. So [2,1,2,2,2,2]. But the output is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. So that doesn't match. So probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of 1s in each of the first six positions of the input. But again, that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns across the examples. For example, in Example 0, the output lists have 6 elements. In Example 1, the outputs have 9 elements. In Example 2, the outputs have 8 elements. So the output length varies per example. But in each example, the output lists are of the same length. So perhaps the output length is determined by the number of input lists in the example. For example, Example 0 has 7 output lists, each of length 6. But the input has 17 lists. Not sure.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that each training example is a pair of input and output. For example, in Example 0, the input is a list of multiple lists, and the output is another list of multiple lists. The task is to find the pattern that maps the input to the output. Then apply that to the test input.\n\nSo each example's input is a collection of lists, and the output is another collection of lists. The number of output lists varies. For instance, in Example 0, there are 7 output lists. But the input has 17 lists. So perhaps the output lists are derived from certain input lists that match a specific condition. For example, in Example 0, maybe only the input lists that have a sequence of six 1s are transformed into output lists. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input lists, the fifth list has six 1s. The corresponding output is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. The seventh input list has a sequence of six 1s as well. Its output is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. So perhaps the output is generated for each input list that contains a sequence of six 1s. But why then are there 7 output lists in Example 0? Let's count how many input lists in Example 0 have a sequence of six 1s.\n\nLooking through the input lists in Example 0:\n\nFirst list: no six 1s.\n\nSecond list: two consecutive 1s.\n\nThird list: no.\n\nFourth list: no.\n\nFifth list: six 1s. So one.\n\nSixth list: six 1s. So two.\n\nSeventh input list: six 1s. Three.\n\nEighth: no.\n\nNinth: six 1s. Fourth.\n\nTenth: no.\n\nEleventh: six 1s. Fifth.\n\nTwelfth: six 1s. Sixth.\n\nThirteenth: no.\n\nWait, the input lists in Example 0 are 17. Let me check each one:\n\n1st: no.\n\n2nd: [6,0,1,0,4,8,6,1,1,2,1,2,6,6,6,5,8,7,4,1,7,5,6]. The 1s are at positions 2,7,8,10,19. Consecutive 1s at 7-8 (two), then others are single.\n\n3rd: [6,8,3,1,9,8,7,1,2,3,9,2,6,2,1,0,5,7,7,7,8,1,3]. 1s at positions 3,7,14,20. No long sequences.\n\n4th: [2,2,9,5,5,6,6,9,3,8,6,2,4,1,8,3,5,7,5,5,6,1,6]. 1s at positions 13 and 20.\n\n5th: [1,7,6,4,7,0,1,7,9,1,7,6,9,6,6,8,4,6,8,8,9,8,0]. 1s at positions 0,6,9. No six.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the fifth input list in Example 0 is: [2, 9, 2, 3, 9, 6, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 7, 2, 4, 0, 1, 6, 4, 5]. Here, positions 8-13 are six 1s. So yes, six consecutive 1s. So this input list would be one that's processed.\n\nThe sixth input list: [8,3,9,5,6,5,6,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,0,1,3,1,6,3,5,1]. Again, positions 8-13: six 1s.\n\nSo in Example 0's input, the fifth, sixth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, twelfth input lists have sequences of six 1s. Let's count: fifth, sixth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, twelfth. That's six input lists. But the output has seven lists. Hmm. So maybe there's another list with six 1s. Let's check the others.\n\nThe eighth input list: [0,7,2,6,5,2,0,7,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,2,3,0,7,5,1,8,8]. Positions 8-11: four 1s, then position 12 is 2, then position 13 is 1. So not six.\n\nThe tenth input list: [5,1,3,2,7,5,2,8,1,2,1,1,1,1,4,6,4,7,5,2,8,9,6]. Positions 8:1, 10-13:1,1,1,1. So five 1s. Not six.\n\nThe thirteenth input list: [5,9,4,8,5,8,8,1,5,3,8,8,4,7,6,4,1,1,8,5,6,2,2]. 1s at positions 7, 16-17. Two consecutive.\n\nThe sixteenth input list: [6,5,3,7,0,9,1,3,2,6,5,0,6,1,0,5,2,7,1,4,8,4,1]. 1s at positions 6, 13, 18, 22. No consecutive.\n\nSo maybe Example 0 has six input lists with six consecutive 1s. But the output has seven lists. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output lists are generated based on sequences of 1s of any length. For example, the output is the lengths of all runs of 1s in the input list. Let's check Example 0's fifth input list, which has a run of six 1s. The output for this is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. Sum of elements is 8, but the run is six. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output lists are formed by taking the digits of the sum of the input list. But Example 0's first output list is [1,2,1,1,2,1], which sums to 8. The sum of the first input list in Example 0 would be more than that. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output lists are the same for certain input lists. For example, in Example 0, the first two output lists are the same. Maybe the pattern is that the output is [1,2,1,1,2,1] whenever the input list has a certain characteristic, and [2,2,2,2,2,2] when it doesn't. But what is that characteristic?\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 0's third output list: [2,2,2,2,2,2]. Let's see the corresponding input list. The third input list in Example 0's input is [6,8,3,1,9,8,7,1,2,3,9,2,6,2,1,0,5,7,7,7,8,1,3]. This input list has 1s at positions 3,7,14,20. So four single 1s. The output is all 2s. So perhaps when there are no runs of 1s longer than a certain length, the output is all 2s. But when there are runs of 1s, the output is a pattern based on the lengths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is [1,2,1,1,2,1] for input lists that contain six consecutive 1s, and [2,2,2,2,2,2] otherwise. But in Example 0, the fifth input list has six 1s and outputs [1,2,1,1,2,1], which matches. The sixth input list also has six 1s and outputs [1,2,1,1,2,1]. But the seventh input list has six 1s and the output is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. The ninth input list also has six 1s. But the output in Example 0 has seven lists, which suggests there are seven input lists that trigger this pattern. But earlier count suggests six. So this theory may not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a fixed list for certain conditions. Like, whenever there's a run of six 1s, output [1,2,1,1,2,1], else output [2,2,2,2,2,2]. But in Example 0, there are seven output lists, which would mean seven input lists meet this condition. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of times 1 appears in the input list. For example, if the count of 1s is six, output [1,2,1,1,2,1]. But in the fifth input list of Example 0, there are six 1s, so output would be six elements, each representing a 1. But the output is [1,2,1,1,2,1], which sums to 8. So that's not it.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. Let me think of another approach.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is not based on the content of the input lists, but their positions. For example, the output lists are formed by taking the 6th, 7th, 8th, etc. elements of the input lists. But in Example 0's first input list, taking elements from position 5 onwards. Let's see:\n\nFirst input list of Example 0: [6,1,2,4,8,3,7,2,6,5,7,7,4,9,2,5,9,4,5,9,3,8,7]. The 6th element (index 5) is 3. Then elements 6-11: 7,2,6,5,7,7. But the output is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. Doesn't seem related.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is generated by looking for the positions of certain digits. For example, in Example 0's output, the first element is 1. Maybe that corresponds to the number of times 1 appears in the first third of the input list. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the differences between consecutive elements in the input list. But calculating that for Example 0's input lists would be time-consuming, and I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by the count of certain digits in the input list, modulo some number. For example, Example 0's output elements are 1 and 2, so maybe counts modulo 3 or something. But not sure.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern that fits all examples. Let's look at Example 1's outputs. The outputs are lists with elements 4 and 1. For instance, [4,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4]. The input lists in Example 1's input have sequences of 4s. For example, the seventh input list has a long run of 4s. The output for that list is [4,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4]. Maybe the output is formed by replacing certain positions in a run of 4s with the next element after the run.\n\nFor example, in the seventh input list of Example 1: [0,0,1,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,7,7,0,4,4,0,4,1,4]. The run of 4s starts at position 4 and has nine 4s. The output is [4,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4]. The next element after the run is 6. So maybe the output is formed by taking the first nine elements of the run (but there are nine 4s), and replacing positions 2,4,6 with 6? But no. The output has 4,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4. The 1s are in positions 2,4,6. So perhaps the next element after the run is 6, but why 1s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by inserting the next element after the run at certain positions. For example, inserting 6 (the next element after the run of 4s) at positions 2,4,6. So the output would be 4,4,6,4,6,4,6,4,4. But the actual output is [4,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by counting the number of occurrences of 4 in each segment of the input list. For example, the seventh input list has nine 4s. If divided into nine segments, each segment could be 2-3 elements. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the output is created by taking the digits of the input list's length. But the input lists in Example 0 are length 23. 23 digits summed would not produce the output.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as representing some sort of encoding of the input list's structure, like the number of times a certain pattern occurs, such as increases or decreases. But without more examples, this is hard to discern.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs across examples:\n\nExample 0's outputs are 6 elements of 1s and 2s.\n\nExample 1's outputs are 9 elements of 4s and 1s.\n\nExample 2's outputs are 8 elements of 8s and 2s.\n\nNoting that in each example, the output elements are the same numbers that appear in long runs in the input lists. For example, in Example 2, the outputs are 8s and 2s, which are numbers that appear in runs in the input. Similarly, in Example 1, outputs are 4s and 1s, which are part of runs in the input.\n\nThis suggests that the output lists are derived from the longest run of a certain number in the input list, modified by inserting another number (possibly the next number after the run) at specific positions.\n\nFor instance, in Example 2, the third input list has a run of eight 8s followed by a 2. The output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. So the first three 8s, then the 2, then the remaining four 8s. This creates an 8-element list. The number of elements in the run is eight, so the output is eight elements. The inserted number is the next after the run.\n\nIn Example 1, the seventh input list has a run of nine 4s followed by 6. The output is nine elements: [4,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4]. But where does the 1 come from? The next element after the run is 6, but that's not 1. Hmm. So this theory breaks.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the inserted number is not the next element, but the number of times the run is interrupted. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the run of numbers, but every third element is replaced by the next number after the run. For example, in Example 2's third input list, the run of eight 8s. Insert the next element (2) at the fourth position (index 3). So the output becomes 8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1's seventh input list, the run of nine 4s. Inserting the next element (6) at positions 2,4,6. But 6 is not 1, so that's not matching. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output lists are formed by taking the run of a certain number and replacing every third occurrence with the number of times that number appears in the run. For example, in a run of eight 8s, replace every third 8 with 2 (since 8 mod 3 is 2). But 8 divided by 3 is 2 with a remainder of 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output lists are formed by the run length. For example, in Example 2's third input list, the run is eight 8s. The output is eight elements. The first three 8s, then 2 (the next element), then four 8s. Total of 3+1+4=8. So the pattern is: take the run length, divide by two, insert the next element in the middle. For example, run length 8: insert after the first four elements. But the output inserts after three. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by inserting the next element after the run at the position equal to the length of the run divided by two. For a run of eight, 8/2 = 4, so insert at position 4. But the output in Example 2's third input list has the 2 at position 3. So maybe (run length - 1) divided by 2. For eight elements: (8-1)/2=3.5, so position 3.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that in each input list, the longest run of the same number is identified. Then, the output is a list of the same length as the run. The output is formed by replacing every other occurrence of the number in the run with the next number after the run, starting from a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the run itself, but with the fourth element replaced by the next number after the run. For example, in Example 2's third input list, the run is eight 8s. Replace the fourth 8 with 2 (the next element). So output becomes [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. This matches. Similarly, if a run is longer than a certain length, replace specific positions.\n\nApplying this to Example 1's seventh input list: run of nine 4s. The next element is 6. Replace the fourth 4 with 6. So the output would be [4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4]. But the actual output is [4,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this pattern works for Example 2 but not for Example 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the run of numbers, but every third element is replaced by the next number after the run. For example, in Example 2's third input list, replacing every third 8 with 2. The run is eight 8s. So positions 0:8, 1:8, 2:8, 3:2, 4:8,5:8,6:8,7:8. So the output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. This matches. For Example 1's seventh input list, the run is nine 4s. Replacing every third 4 with the next element (6) would give [4,4,6,4,4,6,4,4,6]. But the output is [4,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4]. So not matching.\n\nSo this approach works for Example 2 but not others. \n\nLooking back, maybe the answer for the test input is to look for runs of 8s in the test input lists and replace the fourth element with the next number after the run. Let's look at the test input.\n\nThe test input lists are:\n\n[2,7,2,0,2,6,3,0,3,9,1,3,5,3,0,4,5]\n[4,4,8,7,0,7,9,1,4,9,5,2,0,8,5,3,2]\n[8,7,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,1,5,2,1]\n[6,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,1,3,6]\n[0,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,9,5,1,9,4,1]\n[5,2,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,7,9,5]\n[8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,1,7,3,7]\n[8,6,2,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,6,3,1,1,2,9]\n[9,4,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,4,0,6,7,6]\n[6,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,7,1,5,8,4]\n[4,0,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,4,3,4,5]\n[3,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,7,7,1,8]\n[6,6,4,7,6,8,1,8,1,9,2,6,8,7,2,8,8]\n[7,3,5,1,4,1,6,4,9,6,7,7,9,2,3,0,2]\n[9,2,2,5,4,8,3,9,9,9,5,9,6,1,4,6,9]\n[6,1,9,6,3,1,6,6,8,6,0,1,3,4,8,7,7]\n[2,1,2,4,9,2,1,5,1,7,0,7,9,3,8,2,1]\n[7,1,9,4,2,8,4,3,6,2,8,0,8,5,3,5,9]\n[1,2,5,7,8,7,1,6,5,8,0,9,2,8,9,1,5]\n\nLooking for runs of 8s:\n\nThe third input list is [8,7,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,1,5,2,1]. The run of 8s is from position 3 to 10: eight 8s. The next element after the run is 7. So the output would be eight elements: first three 8s, then 7, then four 8s. But wait, the run is eight 8s. If inserting the next element after the run (7) at position 3, the output would be [8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8], but wait, the first element of the list is 8, but the run starts at position 3. Wait, the list is [8,7,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,1,5,2,1]. The 8s are at positions 3-10 (8 elements). So the run is eight 8s. The next element is 7. So the output would be [8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8], but the expected output, based on Example 2's pattern, would be inserting the next element (7) at position 3. But the expected output for this list would be similar to Example 2's outputs. But in Example 2's outputs, when the run was eight 8s followed by 2, the output was [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. So following that pattern, this input list's output would be [8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8].\n\nSimilarly, the fourth input list in the test input is [6,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,1,3,6]. The run of eight 8s is positions 3-10. Next element is 7. So output would be [8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8].\n\nThe fifth input list is [0,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,9,5,1,9,4,1]. Here, the run of 8s is positions 3-8: six 8s. But then there's a 1, followed by an 8. So not a continuous run. The output for this list would not follow the pattern, unless the longest run is considered. So the longest run is six 8s. The next element after that run is 1. So the output would be six elements. But Example 2's output lists are eight elements. Hmm. So this may not fit.\n\nThe sixth input list is [5,2,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,7,9,5]. The run of 8s is from position 3-11: nine 8s. The next element is 3. So the output would be nine elements: insert 3 at position 3. So [8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nBut Example 2's output lists have eight elements. So this may not fit.\n\nThe seventh input list is [8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,1,7,3,7]. The run of 8s is positions 0:8, then 3-10: eight 8s. So the longest run is nine 8s (positions 0 and 3-10?) No, position 0 is 8, then position 3-10 are 8s. So the run would be positions 0,3-10: that's 9 8s. But the output would need to be nine elements. But how?\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess based on Example 2's pattern: for each input list that contains a run of 8s followed by a 2, the output is the first eight elements of the run with the fourth element replaced by 2. In the test input, some lists have runs of 8s followed by other numbers. For example, the third test input list has a run of eight 8s followed by 7, so the output would be [8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8]. But in Example 2's outputs, the fourth element is the next after the run. So applying that to the test input, the lists with long runs of 8s would have outputs where the fourth element is replaced.\n\nBut the test input has multiple lists with runs of 8s. For example, the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, ninth, tenth, eleventh lists have runs of 8s. Let's check:\n\nThird test input list: [8,7,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,1,5,2,1]. The run of 8s starts at position 3 and is eight elements long. Next element is 7. Output would be eight elements: [8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8].\n\nFourth test input list: [6,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,1,3,6]. Eight 8s followed by 7. Output: [8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8].\n\nSixth test input list: [5,2,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,7,9,5]. Nine 8s followed by 3. Output would be [8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8]. But the previous examples' outputs were of varying lengths based on the run length. For example, in Example 2, the output length matched the run length. So nine 8s would produce a nine-element output.\n\nBut in the test input's case, we need to see what the expected output format is. Looking at the training examples, the output lists' lengths vary per example. For the test input, the expected outputs will likely follow the same pattern as Example 2, where each output list is formed by taking the run of 8s and inserting the next element after the run at the fourth position. So for each test input list that has a run of 8s, the output is eight elements long, with the fourth element being the next after the run.\n\nHowever, the test input includes some lists that don't have runs of 8s. For example, the first two lists don't have runs of 8s. For those, perhaps they are not included in the output. But according to the training examples, in Example 0, not all input lists were processed into output lists. Only those with certain conditions (like six 1s) were included.\n\nBut since the problem states that each training example is an input-output pair, and the test input is another set of lists, I need to apply the same pattern. The challenge is to determine which input lists in the test input should produce output lists and what those outputs are.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the pressure of the competition, I'll proceed with the assumption that the output lists are generated by taking the longest run of a certain number (like 8s in Example 2), and inserting the next element after the run at the fourth position. For the test input, the outputs would be lists where each run of 8s is transformed in this way.\n\nSo for the test input lists:\n\nLooking for runs of 8s:\n\nThird input list: 8-run of 8 elements. Output: [8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8].\n\nFourth input list: 8-run of 8 elements. Output: [8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8].\n\nFifth input list: 6 8s followed by 1. So run of 6. Output: [8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8] (assuming run of 6 is padded to 8 elements, but not sure).\n\nSixth input list: 9 8s. Output: [8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nBut the output length varies. However, in Example 2's outputs, the length matches the run length. So for a run of 8, output length is 8. For a run of 9, output length is 9. But in the test input's case, the sixth list has nine 8s, so output would be nine elements.\n\nBut the training examples have varying output lengths. Example 2's outputs are 8 elements long. However, the test input's sixth list's output would need to be nine elements. But the training examples like Example 1 had varying lengths.\n\nThis is getting too uncertain. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to generate the outputs for the test input lists that have runs of 8s, replacing the fourth element with the next number after the run, and output them in the same format as the training examples.\n\nThe test input lists with runs of 8s:\n\nThird list: [8,7,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,1,5,2,1] \u2192 run of 8s at positions 3-10 (8 elements). Next element is 7. Output: [8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8].\n\nFourth list: [6,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,1,3,6] \u2192 run of 8s positions 3-10. Next element 7. Output: [8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8].\n\nFifth list: [0,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,9,5,1,9,4,1] \u2192 run of 8s positions 3-8 (6 elements). Next element 1. Output: [8,8,8,1,8,8].\n\nBut this is only six elements. But Example 2's outputs had eight elements. Hmm. So maybe only the lists with runs of 8s of length 8 are included. For example, the third, fourth, sixth, seventh, ninth, tenth, eleventh lists have runs of 8s of length 8 or more.\n\nSixth list: [5,2,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,7,9,5] \u2192 nine 8s. Output: [8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nSeventh list: [8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,1,7,3,7] \u2192 nine 8s. Next element 7. Output: [8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8].\n\nNinth list: [9,4,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,4,0,6,7,6] \u2192 run of eight 8s. Next element 6. Output: [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8].\n\nTenth list: [6,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,7,1,5,8,4] \u2192 eight 8s. Next element 4. Output: [8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8].\n\nEleventh list: [4,0,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,4,3,4,5] \u2192 eight 8s. Next element 4. Output: [8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8].\n\nTwelfth list: [3,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,7,7,1,8] \u2192 eight 8s. Next element 4. Output: [8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8].\n\nBut how many output lists are there? The test input has 19 input lists. But according to the pattern, only those with runs of 8s of a certain length would be included.\n\nIn Example 2's output, the first three output lists are [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8], but the fourth output list is [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]. So perhaps if there's a run of 8s followed by 2, the output is as described, else, all 2s. But that's not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed to output for each test input list that has a run of 8s the corresponding transformed list, and for those without, perhaps output a list of all 2s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the test input's outputs are all lists of eight elements, following the pattern of Example 2. So for each input list in the test input, check if there's a run of eight 8s. If so, output [8,8,8,X,8,8,8,8], where X is the next element. For those without, output a list of all 2s.\n\nApplying this to the test input lists:\n\nThird list: next element after 8-run is 7. Output: [8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8].\n\nFourth list: next element 7. Output: same as third.\n\nFifth list: run of six 8s. Not eight. So output [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].\n\nSixth list: run of nine 8s. So output [8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8], but this is nine elements, which doesn't fit Example 2's eight-element pattern. So perhaps not.\n\nBut the test input's output may require following Example 2's pattern, where the output is eight elements, even if the run is longer. For example, take the first eight 8s of a run, then replace the fourth element with the next element.\n\nSo for the sixth test input list (nine 8s), take the first eight 8s, next element is 3. Output: [8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8].\n\nSimilarly, for the seventh list (nine 8s), take first eight, next element 7. Output: [8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8].\n\nNinth list: eight 8s, next element 6. Output: [8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8].\n\nTenth list: eight 8s, next element 4. Output: [8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8].\n\nEleventh list: eight 8s, next element 4. Output: [8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8].\n\nTwelfth list: eight 8s, next element 4. Output: [8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8].\n\nOther test input lists without eight 8s would output all 2s. For example, the first two lists.\n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\n[8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8]\n\n[8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8] (for the fifth input list with six 8s, but I'm not sure)\n\nBut given the time and the pattern observed in the training examples, I'll proceed with the following answer for the test input:",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to find the pattern in the training examples that maps the input lists to the output lists and then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by analyzing each example to see what's going on.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nThe input is a bunch of lists of numbers, and the output is a list of six elements, mostly consisting of 1s and 2s. The outputs for Example 0 are either [1,2,1,1,2,1] or [2,2,2,2,2,2]. Hmm. Let me look at the input lists here. Maybe the output is derived from some pattern in the input lists. For instance, maybe counting certain sequences or occurrences of numbers?\n\nWait, but each input has multiple lists, and the output is a single list. So perhaps each output corresponds to one input list. Wait, looking at Example 0's input: there are 17 input lists, and the output has 7 lists. Wait, the example says \"INPUT\" followed by multiple lists, and \"OUTPUT\" followed by 7 lists. So maybe each input list is processed into an output list, but perhaps some of them are grouped. Alternatively, maybe each output is generated from a group of input lists. But the first example's input has 17 lists and output has 7 lists, so perhaps each output corresponds to a single input list. Let me check the counts. Example 0's input lists are 17 in number, and the output lists are 7. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So maybe the output is generated from a subset of the input lists. Or perhaps the outputs are generated for certain positions in the input lists. Wait, maybe the output is generated by looking for a specific pattern in each input list and then extracting some part of it.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input list: [6, 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 7, 2, 6, 5, 7, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5, 9, 4, 5, 9, 3, 8, 7]. The output is [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]. Maybe looking for sequences of numbers. Let's check if there's a repeating pattern here. Wait, perhaps the output is derived from the counts of consecutive numbers. Like, how many times a certain number appears in a row? Alternatively, maybe the output is the lengths of runs of a specific number. For instance, in the input list, maybe looking for runs of 1s and 2s. Wait, but the output includes 1s and 2s. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking a part of the input list where there's a sequence of 1s. Looking at the input lists in Example 0, several of them have sequences of 1s. For example, the second input list in Example 0 is [6,0,1,0,4,8,6,1,1,2,1,2,6,6,6,5,8,7,4,1,7,5,6]. Here, there's a 1 followed by another 1, then a 2, then 1 again. Wait, but the output for this example is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the digits after a certain marker. For example, maybe there's a sequence of consecutive 1s in the input list, and the numbers following or surrounding that sequence are used. Looking at the first input list in Example 0, I don't see any consecutive 1s, but the output is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. Hmm. Maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nLet's look at Example 1. The input lists here have several sequences of 4s. For example, the seventh input list in Example 1 is [5,6,0,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,6,4,9,8,2,6,3,8,2]. The output for Example 1's first output is [4,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4]. This output has 9 elements. Maybe the output is formed by taking the numbers around a long run of 4s. For instance, if there's a sequence of nine 4s, perhaps the numbers before and after are taken. But the input list here has a run of nine 4s (from index 4 to 12). The output is [4,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4]. Wait, but how does that relate? Let's see: the numbers before the run are 5,6,0,8, then the 4s start. After the run of 4s, there's 0,6,4,9, etc. But how does this connect to the output? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the counts of 4s in certain positions. Wait, but the output has 9 elements. The run of 4s here is 9 in length. Maybe each element in the output corresponds to the number of consecutive 4s in that position? No, the output elements are 4s,1s, etc. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input lists have sequences of 8s, and the outputs are lists of 8s and 2s. For example, the third input list in Example 2 is [5,5,6,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,2,7]. The output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. Wait, maybe the output is a part of the input list where there's a long run of 8s. Let's check: the input list has eight 8s starting at index 5. The output here is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. Wait, the input has eight 8s (positions 5-12: indices 4 to 11 perhaps?), but the output includes a 2. Wait, maybe there's a break in the sequence. Wait, looking at the input list: 3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (from index 5 to 12?), so that's eight 8s. Then the next number is 2. So the output is taking the 8s and the 2? But the output is eight elements. Let me count: [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8] has 8 elements. So the first three 8s, then the 2, then four more 8s? That doesn't fit. Wait, the input list in this case is [5,5,6,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,2,7]. The 8s start at index 4 (value 3) then index 5 is 8, then six more 8s (indices 5-12: eight 8s). Then after that is 2. So the input has eight 8s followed by a 2. The output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. Wait, that's four 8s, then a 2, then three 8s. That doesn't align. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is capturing the position where the run of 8s is interrupted. For instance, if there's a run of 8s but there's a different number in the middle. Let's look at the fifth input list in Example 2: [1,7,3,3,5,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,7,1,1,4]. Here, the sequence is 8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8. So that's three 8s, a 2, then four 8s. The output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8], which matches exactly. So maybe whenever there's a run of 8s with a single 2 in between, the output captures that. But then why in the third input list of Example 2, the output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8], but in the input, after the eight 8s, there's a 2. Wait, but the output has a 2 in the fourth position, but in the input list, the 2 comes after all the 8s. So perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs in Example 2: the outputs are lists of 8 elements. For example, the first output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. The fourth output in Example 2 is [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2], which is all 2s. The input list corresponding to that output is [5,5,6,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,2,7], but the output is all 2s. Wait, no, that's the third input list. Wait, maybe the fourth output in Example 2 is from a different input. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input lists in Example 2:\n\nThe third input is [5,5,6,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,2,7], and the output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. Wait, but the input's run of 8s is eight in a row (indices 5-12?), followed by 2. But the output includes a 2 in the fourth position. That doesn't match the input's structure. Hmm, perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is generated by taking a segment of the input where there's a long run of a certain number, and then inserting another number in the middle. For instance, in Example 2, the output often has a 2 interrupting a run of 8s. But how does that tie to the input?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived from the input list by extracting sequences where a certain number (like 1, 2, 4, or 8) repeats, and then modifying them based on some rule.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's outputs. The output lists have 6 elements. For example, the first output is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. The numbers 1 and 2 are present. Maybe this is related to binary, but not sure. Alternatively, the pattern could be the differences between consecutive numbers in a certain part of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of certain numbers. For example, in the input lists, if there's a sequence like 1,1,1,1,1,1, then the output is [2,2,2,2,2,2], as in the third output of Example 0. Let's check. The third input list in Example 0 is [2,2,9,5,5,6,6,9,3,8,6,2,4,1,8,3,5,7,5,5,6,1,6]. The output is [2,2,2,2,2,2]. But where is the sequence of 1s here? There's a '1' at index 13. Not a sequence. Hmm. Wait, maybe the output is not directly related to sequences of 1s, but something else.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input lists again. Let's check the input lists that correspond to the output [1,2,1,1,2,1]. The first input list in Example 0's input is [6,1,2,4,8,3,7,2,6,5,7,7,4,9,2,5,9,4,5,9,3,8,7]. The output is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. Maybe the output is derived from the count of specific digits in the input. Let's count the occurrences of 1 and 2 in this input. 1 appears once, 2 appears three times. But the output has more elements. Maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: The output length varies between examples. Example 0's outputs have 6 elements, Example 1's have 9, Example 2's have 8. So the output length depends on the input. Looking at Example 2, the output length is 8, and the input lists have runs of 8s. Maybe the output is a modified version of a certain run in the input. For instance, in the input list where there's a run of 8s followed by a 2, the output is that run with the 2 inserted in the middle. For example, in the fifth input list of Example 2: [1,7,3,3,5,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,7,1,1,4], the run is 8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8. The output is exactly this sequence. So the output is extracting this part of the input. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nIn Example 0, the output lists are shorter. Let's see if there's a pattern. For instance, the first output in Example 0 is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. Looking at the first input list of Example 0, perhaps there's a section where numbers 1 and 2 appear in a certain order. Let's check the input list: [6,1,2,4,8,3,7,2,6,5,7,7,4,9,2,5,9,4,5,9,3,8,7]. The numbers 1 and 2 are at positions 1, 2, 7, and 14. So 1 is at index 1, then 2 at 2. Then later 2 at 7, and 2 again at 14. Maybe the output is taking the numbers between the 1 and 2s. But the output is [1,2,1,1,2,1], which could be 1 followed by 2, then three 1s and a 2, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking for a specific pattern in the input lists. For instance, in Example 0, the output lists alternate between [1,2,1,1,2,1] and [2,2,2,2,2,2]. Maybe this depends on whether there's a run of six 1s or not. Looking at the input lists for Example 0, the third input list is [2,2,9,5,5,6,6,9,3,8,6,2,4,1,8,3,5,7,5,5,6,1,6], and the output is [2,2,2,2,2,2]. But I don't see a run of 2s here. There are two 2s at the beginning, then a 2 later. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is formed by taking the first occurrence of a certain pattern in each input list. For example, in Example 2, the output is a run of 8s with a single 2 inserted. So maybe whenever there's a run of 8s with a 2 interrupting it, the output captures that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by replacing certain numbers in the input. For example, in Example 2, replacing the 2s in the middle of 8s with something else.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's outputs again: The output lists have six elements. Let's check the first input list's output: [1,2,1,1,2,1]. If I look at the input list, perhaps there's a section where the numbers 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1 appear. For example, in the first input list: [6,1,2,4,8,3,7,2,6,5,7,7,4,9,2,5,9,4,5,9,3,8,7]. The sequence 1,2 is present at indices 1 and 2. Then later, at index 7 there's 2 again, but not followed by 1. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother idea: The outputs might be generated by looking for a specific subsequence in the input. For example, in Example 1, the outputs often have 4s and 1s. Perhaps the outputs are capturing runs of 4s and any numbers that break them. For instance, in the seventh input list of Example 1's input, which has a long run of 4s, the output is [4,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4]. Maybe the 1s in the output correspond to breaks in the run of 4s. But in the input list, the run is nine 4s in a row. So how does that output relate? The output has 4s and 1s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the numbers before and after a long run. For example, in Example 1's seventh input list, the run of 4s starts after 8, so maybe taking the numbers before and after the run. The numbers before are 5,6,0,8, and after are 0,6,4,9, etc. But the output is [4,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4]. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that in each example, the output is formed by taking a section of the input list where there's a repeated number (like 1s in Example 0, 4s in Example 1, 8s in Example 2) and then the output is some transformation of that section. For instance, in Example 0, the input lists have sequences of 1s, and the output is derived from those sequences. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the second input list in Example 0: [6,0,1,0,4,8,6,1,1,2,1,2,6,6,6,5,8,7,4,1,7,5,6]. The output is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. The input has a sequence of two 1s (indices 7 and 8), then a 2, then a 1, another 2, etc. The output seems to be taking the 1s and 2s from that part. The output sequence is [1,2,1,1,2,1], which could correspond to the subsequence [1,1,2,1,2,1] but modified. Wait, maybe the output counts the number of consecutive repeats. For example, the two 1s become 2, but the output here starts with 1. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking for a section where there are multiple 1s and 2s in a certain pattern. For example, in the second input list of Example 0, the subsequence 1,1,2,1,2 could be transformed into [1,2,1,1,2,1]. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of how many times each number in a specific subsequence appears. For example, in the subsequence 1,1,2,1,2, the counts could be 2 (for 1s), 1 (for 2), 1 (for 1), 1 (for 2), which might be transformed into [2,1,1,1], but that doesn't fit the output.\n\nAnother angle: Let's compare the input and output lengths. For Example 0, each output list has 6 elements. The input lists vary in length, but perhaps each output is derived from a specific part of the input list. For example, the middle six elements. Let's check the first input list of Example 0: length is 23. Middle six elements would be positions 9-14: 5,7,7,4,9,2. But the output is [1,2,1,1,2,1]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived from the digits of the sum of certain elements. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is generated by looking for a specific pattern in the input list. For example, in Example 0, the outputs alternate between [1,2,1,1,2,1] and [2,2,2,2,2,2]. Maybe this corresponds to whether there is an even or odd number of 1s in a certain part of the input. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nLooking at the test input provided:\n\nThe test input lists are 19 in total. Let's look at the third list in the test input: [8,7,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,1,5,2,1]. This has eight 8s in a row. Then the next list is [6,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,1,3,6], which also has eight 8s. The fifth test input list is [5,2,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,7,9,5] \u2014 nine 8s. \n\nLooking at Example 2, when the input list has a run of eight 8s followed by a different number, the output is a sequence of eight elements with a 2 inserted. But in the test input, some lists have runs of eight 8s. For example, the third test input list has eight 8s. But what's the output pattern here?\n\nIn Example 2, when there's a run of eight 8s followed by a 2, the output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. So maybe whenever there's a run of eight 8s, the output is that run with the fourth element replaced by a 2. Wait, in the third input list of Example 2, the run is eight 8s followed by a 2. The output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8], which inserts the 2 into the fourth position. So perhaps the pattern is to split the run of 8s into two parts and insert a 2 in the middle.\n\nBut how does that apply to other examples? For instance, the fifth input list in Example 2 has a run of three 8s, a 2, then four 8s. The output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8], which is exactly that sequence. So maybe the output is capturing any such run where a 2 is present in the middle of 8s, regardless of the length. But then, why in the fourth output of Example 2, the output is all 2s. Looking at the corresponding input list, which is [5,5,6,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,2,7], the run is eight 8s followed by a 2. But the output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. Wait, no, in the third input list of Example 2, the output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8], but the 2 comes after the eight 8s, not in the middle. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to look for another approach.\n\nAlternative plan: Let's assume that the output is formed by taking a run of a specific number (like 8s in Example 2, 4s in Example 1, 1s in Example 0) and then inserting another number (like 2) at a specific position. For instance, in Example 2, whenever there's a run of 8s, the output is that run with a 2 inserted after the third 8. So for a run of eight 8s, the output would be [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. If there's a 2 already present in the run, like in the fifth input list of Example 2, then the output is the same as that sequence.\n\nIf this is the case, then the test input lists that have runs of 8s would have outputs with a 2 inserted. Looking at the third test input list: [8,7,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,1,5,2,1]. The run of eight 8s is from index 3 to 10. The output should be [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8], inserting a 2 at the fourth position. But in the actual input, there are no 2s in that run. Wait, but how do we know where to insert the 2? This line of thinking might not hold.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 2's output lists, the fourth element is often a 2. For example, the first three outputs are [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. The fourth output is all 2s, so every element is 2. So maybe when the input has a run of 8s with a 2 interrupting, the output is that segment. Otherwise, if there's a run of 2s, then the output is all 2s.\n\nBut in the fourth input list of Example 2's output, which is [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2], the corresponding input list is [5,5,6,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,2,7]. Wait, that input list doesn't have a run of 2s. So why is the output all 2s? That doesn't fit. Maybe the output is derived from a different part of the input. Or perhaps the output is all 2s when there's no interruption in the run of 8s. But that doesn't make sense, as the fourth output in Example 2 is all 2s but the input has a run of 8s followed by a 2.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a common theme across all examples.\n\nExample 0's output elements are 1s and 2s. Example 1's are 4s and 1s. Example 2's are 8s and 2s. It seems like the output uses the dominant number from the input's run and inserts another number (like 2 in Example 2, 1 in Example 1, etc.).\n\nSo, the pattern might be: For each input list, look for the longest run of a certain number. The output is a sequence that starts with that number repeated a few times, then inserts another number, then continues with the original number. The length of the output depends on the example.\n\nFor Example 0, the output is always 6 elements. Maybe the longest run is of 1s, and the output is inserting 2s in specific positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a template where certain positions are filled with a specific number based on the input's run.\n\nAnother approach: The outputs in each example seem to have a certain pattern of 1s and another number. In Example 0, it's 1 and 2; in Example 1, 4 and 1; in Example 2, 8 and 2. This suggests that the output is constructed by taking a sequence of the dominant number (like 1s in Example 0) and inserting another number (like 2) in specific positions. The positions of insertion could be fixed. For example, in Example 0's output [1,2,1,1,2,1], the 2s are at positions 1 and 4. In Example 1's output [4,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4], the 1s are at positions 2,4,6. Example 2's output [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8] has the 2 at position 3.\n\nThis suggests that the output is created by taking a sequence of the dominant number (like 1,4,8) and inserting another number (2,1,2) at fixed positions. The length of the output depends on the example. But how does this relate to the input?\n\nPerhaps each example focuses on a different dominant number. For instance, Example 0's input lists have runs of 1s, Example 1's have runs of 4s, and Example 2's have runs of 8s. The output is then a pattern where the dominant number is repeated, and another number is inserted in fixed positions.\n\nBut how is the other number determined? For Example 0, the inserted number is 2. For Example 1, it's 1. For Example 2, it's 2. Maybe the other number is the one that appears right after the run in the input. For example, in Example 2's first input list, after the run of 8s, there's a 2, so the inserted number is 2. In Example 1's input lists, after the run of 4s, there's a 0 or 6, but the inserted number is 1. That doesn't fit. So this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, the other number could be the one that appears most frequently in the input list besides the dominant number. For Example 0, if the dominant number is 1, the next frequent is 2, so inserted as 2. For Example 1, dominant is 4, next frequent is 1. For Example 2, dominant is 8, next is 2. This could make sense, but how to verify.\n\nBut looking at Example 0's first input list: [6,1,2,4,8,3,7,2,6,5,7,7,4,9,2,5,9,4,5,9,3,8,7]. The numbers 1 and 2 appear twice and three times, respectively. So the other number is 2. In Example 1's seventh input list: [5,6,0,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,6,4,9,8,2,6,3,8,2]. The dominant number is 4 (nine times), and the other numbers include 0,6,9, etc. The inserted number is 1, but why?\n\nThis approach isn't clear. Let's think differently. Maybe the output is generated by taking the dominant run in the input and then creating a pattern where the inserted number is the length of the run divided by some factor. For example, if the run is of length 9 (Example 1), inserting 1 at positions 2,4,6. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated based on the positions of the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, which are powers of 2. The output numbers are also powers of 2. But how?\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the outputs for each example:\n\n- Example 0 outputs: 1,2\n- Example 1 outputs: 4,1\n- Example 2 outputs: 8,2\n\nNotice that in each example, the inserted number is 2 in Example 0 and 2, 1 in others. This might be a red herring.\n\nPerhaps the key is to look for a repeated sequence of the same number in the input lists and then produce a specific pattern based on that. For example, in Example 0's output, [1,2,1,1,2,1] could be the pattern when there's a run of 1s followed by 2s. But again, not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the safest approach is to assume that for each test input list, we need to look for a run of 8s and insert a 2 in the fourth position, similar to Example 2. Let's look at the test input's third list: [8,7,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,1,5,2,1]. The run of 8s is from index 3 to 10 (eight 8s). The output would be [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8], inserting a 2 at position 3. But the original input has eight 8s in a row. So inserting a 2 in the fourth position would split it into three 8s, then 2, then four 8s. But why would that be the case? It's possible that the pattern is to take a run of eight 8s and replace the fourth element with a 2.\n\nLooking at the third test input list's run of eight 8s: replacing the fourth 8 with a 2 gives [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8], which matches Example 2's output pattern.\n\nSimilarly, the fourth test input list is [6,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,1,3,6]. The run of eight 8s is from index 3 to 10. Replacing the fourth 8 with a 2 would give the same output. So the output would be [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8].\n\nThe fifth test input list is [5,2,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,7,9,5]. Here, there's a run of nine 8s. If the pattern is to replace the fourth 8 with a 2, the output would be [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8], but the output in Example 2 has eight elements. So maybe it's taking the first eight 8s and inserting a 2 in the fourth position, resulting in eight elements. So even if there are nine 8s, the output would take the first eight and insert the 2. So for nine 8s, output would be [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8].\n\nThe sixth test input list is [8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,1,7,3,7]. This has a run of eight 8s starting from index 3 (assuming the list is [8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7...]). Wait, actually, the list is [8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7...]. So from index 3 to 10, there are eight 8s. But the list shows eight 8s there. If we insert a 2 at the fourth position, the output would be [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8].\n\nThe seventh test input list is [8,6,2,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,6,3,1,1,2,9]. This has a run starting with 8,8, then a 2, then 8,8, but interrupted by a 1. The output would depend on where the run is. But perhaps the output is [8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8], but not sure.\n\nThe eighth test input list is [9,4,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,4,0,6,7,6]. The run of eight 8s is from index 3 to 10. Inserting a 2 at the fourth position gives [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8].\n\nThe ninth test input list is [6,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,7,1,5,8,4]. Run of eight 8s from index 3 to 10. Output would be [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8].\n\nTenth test input list: [4,0,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,4,3,4,5]. Eight 8s. Output same as before.\n\nEleventh test input list: [3,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,7,7,1,8]. Eight 8s. Output [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8].\n\nTwelfth test input list: [6,6,4,7,6,8,1,8,1,9,2,6,8,7,2,8,8]. This list has a more complicated structure. There's an 8 at index 5, then 1, 8, 1, etc. Not sure. But if there's a run of 8s, maybe the output is derived from that. However, the run is not long enough. \n\nThe thirteenth to nineteenth test input lists don't have obvious long runs of 8s, so their outputs might be all 2s, similar to the fourth output in Example 2. For example, the thirteenth test input list is [7,3,5,1,4,1,6,4,9,6,7,7,9,2,3,0,2], which doesn't have a long run of 8s. So the output would be all 2s: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].\n\nPutting this all together, the test input has several lists with runs of eight 8s. For those, the output would be [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. For lists without such runs, the output would be all 2s. However, looking at the test input lists:\n\n- Lists 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 have runs of eight 8s. So their outputs would be [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8].\n- Lists 0,1,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 may not have runs of eight 8s, so their outputs would be all 2s of length 8. For example, if the output length for Example 2 is 8, then those lists would output [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].\n\nBut how many output lists would there be? The test input has 19 lists. Looking at the training examples, the number of output lists varies. For example, Example 0 has 7 outputs from 17 inputs. So perhaps each output list corresponds to one input list. But the test input has 19 lists, so the output should have 19 lists. However, in the training examples, the outputs are shorter than the inputs. For instance, Example 0 has 17 inputs and 7 outputs, which suggests that not all input lists are processed into outputs. So perhaps the output lists are generated only for input lists that meet a certain condition. For example, in Example 2, only lists with runs of 8s are included in the output. The other input lists are ignored. \n\nBut this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the output lists are generated for all input lists, but some are transformed into a specific pattern and others into another.\n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed with the assumption that for the test input, each list with a run of eight 8s will have an output of [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8], and others will have [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]. \n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input lists:\n\n1. [2,7,2,0,2,6,3,0,3,9,1,3,5,3,0,4,5] \u2192 no long 8s \u2192 output [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n2. [4,4,8,7,0,7,9,1,4,9,5,2,0,8,5,3,2] \u2192 no 8s \u2192 output all 2s\n3. [8,7,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,1,5,2,1] \u2192 eight 8s \u2192 output [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]\n4. [6,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,1,3,6] \u2192 eight 8s \u2192 output [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]\n5. [0,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,9,5,1,9,4,1] \u2192 six 8s then a 1 \u2192 run is six 8s followed by 1. Not eight, so output all 2s\n6. [5,2,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,7,9,5] \u2192 nine 8s \u2192 take first eight and output [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]\n7. [8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,1,7,3,7] \u2192 eight 8s \u2192 output [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]\n8. [8,6,2,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,6,3,1,1,2,9] \u2192 starts with 8,6,2 \u2192 not a run of 8s. So output all 2s\n9. [9,4,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,4,0,6,7,6] \u2192 eight 8s \u2192 output [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]\n10. [6,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,7,1,5,8,4] \u2192 eight 8s \u2192 output [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]\n11. [4,0,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,4,3,4,5] \u2192 eight 8s \u2192 output [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]\n12. [3,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,7,7,1,8] \u2192 eight 8s \u2192 output [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]\n13. [6,6,4,7,6,8,1,8,1,9,2,6,8,7,2,8,8] \u2192 scattered 8s \u2192 no run of eight \u2192 output all 2s\n14. [7,3,5,1,4,1,6,4,9,6,7,7,9,2,3,0,2] \u2192 no 8s \u2192 output all 2s\n15. [9,2,2,5,4,8,3,9,9,9,5,9,6,1,4,6,9] \u2192 no 8s \u2192 output all 2s\n16. [6,1,9,6,3,1,6,6,8,6,0,1,3,4,8,7,7] \u2192 no 8s \u2192 output all 2s\n17. [2,1,2,4,9,2,1,5,1,7,0,7,9,3,8,2,1] \u2192 no 8s \u2192 output all 2s\n18. [7,1,9,4,2,8,4,3,6,2,8,0,8,5,3,5,9] \u2192 scattered 8s \u2192 output all 2s\n19. [1,2,5,7,8,7,1,6,5,8,0,9,2,8,9,1,5] \u2192 scattered 8s \u2192 output all 2s\n\nSo the outputs would be:\n\n- For lists 3,4,6,9,10,11,12: [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]\n- For list 5: the run is eight 8s followed by one more 8 and then a 1. Wait, the fifth test input list is [5,2,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,7,9,5]. The run of 8s is from index 3 to 11 (nine 8s). So taking the first eight 8s and inserting a 2 would result in [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. So list 5's output would be [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8].\n\nFor list 7: the input is [8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,1,7,3,7]. The run of 8s starts at index 3 and continues until index 11 (nine 8s). So the first eight would be indices 3-10, and inserting a 2 at the fourth position gives [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8].\n\nList 8's input is [8,6,2,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,6,3,1,1,2,9]. The first few elements are 8,6,2, which aren't a run. The following elements have 8,8,1: so not a long run of 8s. So this list's output would be all 2s.\n\nThus, the test outputs would be:\n\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nBut according to Example 2's fourth output, when there's a run of 8s followed by a 2, the output is all 2s. Wait, no. In Example 2's fourth output, the input has eight 8s followed by a 2, but the output is all 2s. But according to our previous analysis, that's not the case. So perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect. \n\nWait, in Example 2, the fourth output is [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]. The corresponding input list is [5,5,6,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,2,7]. The run of 8s is from index 5 to 12 (eight 8s), followed by a 2. The output is all 2s, which doesn't fit the previous pattern. So my previous reasoning is incorrect. This suggests that the pattern is not simply inserting a 2 into the run of 8s. There must be another rule.\n\nRevisiting Example 2: The fourth output is all 2s. Let's look at the corresponding input list. It's [5,5,6,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,2,7]. The run of 8s is eight in a row, followed by a 2. The output is [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]. This contradicts the previous pattern. So there's a different rule here.\n\nAnother observation: The output in Example 2's fourth case is all 2s, and the input list has a 2 after the run of 8s. Maybe the output is all 2s if the number following the run of 8s is a 2. Otherwise, if the following number is not 2, the output is the run of 8s with a 2 inserted. \n\nLooking at Example 2's first three input lists:\n\n1. First input list: [0,0,7,9,8,8,0,8,9,9,3,1,4,5,2,7,6] \u2192 output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. But where is the run of 8s? The input has 8,8,0,8. Not a long run. So this doesn't fit. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nWait, maybe the output is determined by the presence of a specific sequence in the input. For Example 2, the outputs are either a sequence of 8s with a 2 in the fourth position or all 2s. The inputs that result in all 2s might have a 2 in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the numbers after the run of 8s. For Example 2's fourth input list, after the eight 8s is a 2. So the output is eight 2s. But why eight? Because the run of 8s is eight in length. So the output is the same length as the run, filled with the number following the run.\n\nSo in Example 2's fourth input list: after eight 8s comes a 2. The output is eight 2s. In the fifth input list of Example 2, after three 8s comes a 2, then four more 8s. The output is eight elements: [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. So maybe when the number following the run is a 2, the output is all 2s of the same length as the run. When the run is interrupted by a 2, the output is the actual sequence. \n\nThis could make sense. For Example 2:\n\n- If the run of 8s is followed by a 2, the output is all 2s with the same length as the run.\n- If the run of 8s is interrupted by a 2, the output is the sequence of 8s with the 2 in place.\n\nSo for the fourth input list in Example 2, the run of eight 8s is followed by a 2. So output is eight 2s. For the fifth input list, the run is three 8s, then a 2, then four 8s. The entire sequence is eight elements long (3+1+4=8), so the output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8].\n\nIf this is the case, then in the test input:\n\n- Lists with runs of 8s followed by a 2 will output all 2s of the same length.\n- Lists with runs of 8s interrupted by a 2 will output the sequence with the 2 included.\n- Other lists may output something else, possibly all 2s.\n\nBut how to determine this for the test input?\n\nLooking at the test input lists:\n\nTest input list 3: [8,7,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,1,5,2,1]. The run of eight 8s is followed by 7. So output would be eight 7s? But in Example 2, the outputs are 8s and 2s. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is different. For example, the output is all 2s if the number after the run is a 2, else the output is the run of 8s. But in Example 2's fourth case, the output is all 2s even though the run is followed by a 2. In the fifth case, the run is interrupted by a 2, so the output includes the 2. \n\nBut in the third test input list, the run of eight 8s is followed by 7. So the output would be eight 8s with a 2 inserted. But according to Example 2's first output, when the run is not followed by a 2, the output is [8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. So perhaps the rule is:\n\n- If a run of 8s is followed by a 2, the output is all 2s of the same length.\n- If a run of 8s is interrupted by a 2, the output is the actual sequence.\n- If the run of 8s is not followed by or interrupted by a 2, the output is the run with a 2 inserted at the fourth position.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial assumption based on Example 2's patterns and generate the outputs accordingly for the test input.",
