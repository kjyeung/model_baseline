        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of lists (or maybe a grid) and the output is another transformed grid. The key is to understand how the input gets transformed into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0: The input has a lot of 8s and some 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s. The output seems to extract certain blocks. For instance, in the input's 4th row (0-indexed?), there's [8,8,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,8,...], and in the output, this pattern appears in the second row as [0s...,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0s]. Similarly, other parts of the input's non-8 and non-0 regions are copied into the output. But maybe the 8s and 0s are acting as borders, and the output is taking the regions that are surrounded by 8s or 0s and placing them in the output, perhaps rotating or shifting them.\n\nWait, looking closer, the output for Example 0 has two main blocks: one in the middle with 1s and 2s, and another lower block with 3s. The input's lower half has 0s and some 3s. Maybe the output is combining these regions. Alternatively, maybe the transformation is taking certain parts of the input where the surrounding numbers (like 8 or 0) are replaced with 0 in the output, and the non-border numbers (1,2,3) are kept, but arranged in a certain way.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 6s and 1s, 8s, and 3s. The output seems to have a lot of 1s, but some 3s and 8s. The output arrays are shorter than the input. For example, the input has 20 elements per row, but the output has 10. Maybe the output is taking the right half of the input? Let's check. The first input row ends with ten 1s. The first output row is [1,1,...], which matches the last ten elements. But the next input rows have varying elements in the last ten positions, and the output rows seem to be those last ten elements but with some transformations. For instance, the second input row ends with [1,1,1,1,1,8,1,8,1,1], and the output's second row is [1,1,1,1,1,8,3,8,1,1]. Wait, the 8s are kept, but maybe the 3s are inserted based on neighboring values? Or perhaps there's a kernel operation, like a convolution, where each output cell depends on its neighbors in the input.\n\nBut Example 2's input has rows of 4s and 8s, and some 2s and 1s. The output rows are shorter (8 elements instead of 16). For example, the second input row is [4s, 8, 2, 1, 1, 8s], and the output's second row is [4,4,4,4,2,1,1,4]. Wait, that looks like the first 8 elements of the input row? Or maybe it's combining the left and right parts. For instance, the input rows split into two parts (left 8 elements and right 8), and the output takes the left part but replaces some parts with the right's elements. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are acting as separators, and the output is taking the parts that are not 8s. But in the input rows of Example 2, the left half is 4s and the right is 8s and some 1s, 2s. The output rows seem to have parts from both. For instance, the first output row is [4x8], which matches the left part of the input's first row. The second input row has left part [4x8] and right part [8,1,1,1,8s...], and the output row is [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,4]. So the first four 4s, then the next four from the right part, but the 8 is replaced with 1? Or perhaps the output is merging the left and right parts, replacing 8s with 1s? Or maybe there's a vertical flip or some kind of mirroring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the process involves taking each row and splitting it into two parts (left and right) based on a certain point, then combining them in a specific way. For example, in Example 2, the output rows are 8 elements long, which is half of the input's 16. So maybe each output row is a combination of the left and right parts, but only taking a certain number of elements from each. Like the left half's first 4 elements and the right half's next 4 elements, but processed to replace certain numbers.\n\nLooking at the Test Input, which has 12 elements per row. The first part is all 4s, then there's a part with 2s and 8s. The output would need to be transformed based on the pattern. If we follow Example 2's approach, maybe the output rows are shorter, perhaps 6 elements each (since 12/2=6), but the examples vary. Alternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking non-4 and non-2 regions and arranging them, but this is unclear.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the numbers 8 and 0 in the examples act as a background, and the output is extracting the non-background elements (like 1,2,3) and arranging them in a new grid. For Example 0, the output has regions that were in the middle of 8s in the input. Similarly, in Example 1, the output might be the non-6 parts. But in Example 2, the input has 4s and 8s as the background, and the output includes 4s, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the top part has a lot of 8s, and the lower part has 0s. The output seems to have extracted the regions that are surrounded by 8s (the middle part) and the regions in the 0 area, but merged them. For example, the middle blocks in the input (with 1s and 2s) are placed in the upper part of the output, and the lower part (with 3s in the 0 area) are placed in the lower part of the output.\n\nBut how? Maybe the output is a combination of certain regions from the input where the surrounding is 8 or 0. For example, any cluster of non-8 and non-0 numbers are extracted and placed in the output, with their original structure, but shifted. The borders (8 or 0) are replaced with 0 in the output. But this might not explain all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid rotated or flipped. For instance, in Example 0, the input has a lot of 8s and 0s, and the output has some blocks that look like they were in the input but rotated. However, it's hard to see the exact rotation.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the numbers, perhaps each number is transformed into another based on some rule. For instance, 8 becomes 0, and other numbers stay the same. But in Example 0, the 8s in the input are turned into 0s in the output. For example, the first row of input is all 8s, and the first output row is all 0s. Similarly, in Example 1, the 6s might become 1s in the output, but in Example 2, 4s remain 4s. So perhaps the transformation is: replace the background numbers (like 8, 0, 6, maybe 2) with 0 or another value, but keep the other numbers. But this varies per example. For example, in Example 1, the input has 6s and the output has 1s. The first row of input is [6,6,...] and the output's first row is [1,1,...], so 6 becomes 1. The 3s in the input remain 3 in the output. The 8 becomes 8 in the output (second row of Example 1's input has 8s, and output has 8s). So the transformation could be:\n\n- 6 \u2192 1\n\n- 8 remains 8 (but in Example 0, 8 becomes 0). Hmm, conflicting.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input has 8s and 0s. The output has 0s where the input had 8s and 0s. So maybe 8 is replaced with 0, and 0 remains 0. But in Example 1, 6 becomes 1, 8 remains 8. In Example 2, 4 remains 4, 8 is replaced with 1 (as in row 2 of Example 2's input: [8, 2, 1, 1, 8...] becomes [2,1,1,4], but wait, the output row is [4,4,4,4,2,1,1,4]. So the 8 in the input's right half is replaced with 1? Or perhaps the left half is kept as 4s, and the right half's 8s are replaced with 1s, except for the 2 which is kept. So maybe the left part is kept, and the right part's 8s become 1s. So for Example 2, the output is the left half of the input (since each input row has 16 elements, output 8) plus the right half with 8s turned to 1s. Let's check:\n\nInput row 1 of Example 2: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8] \u2192 output [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. The right half is all 8s, so in the output they are replaced with 4s? Or maybe the output is the left half (8 elements) of the input. Because the input row has 16 elements, output 8. So for Example 2, the output is the left half (first 8 elements) of each input row. Let's check:\n\nFirst input row of Example 2: 16 elements. Output row is 8 elements, which match the left half (all 4s). Second input row: left 8 are 4s, right 8 start with 8,1,1,1,8... So output row is [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,4]. Wait, that's not the left half. So that theory is invalid.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the output is a combination of the left and right parts, but with certain elements replaced. For example, in Example 2's second input row: the left is 8 4s, the right is 8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8. The output is [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,4]. So the left half is 4,4,4,4, and the right's first four elements (8,1,1,1) become 1,1,1,4. But how? Maybe the 8 becomes 1, and the rest are kept. So 8\u21921, 1\u21921, etc. So the right half's 8s are replaced with 1s, but the 1s stay. Then the output combines left and modified right. Wait, the output row is 8 elements. If the left half is 8 elements, but the output is 8, maybe it's left half plus modified right half. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe each row is split into two halves, and the output takes the left half, then the right half with 8s replaced by 1s.\n\nBut the second input row's right half is [8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8], which would become [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], but the output is [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,4]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's the left half (4s) and the first four elements of the right half, modified. For example, take first four from the right, replace 8 with 1, then append to the left's first four. So left first four 4s, right first four 8,1,1,1 \u2192 1,1,1,1. Then the output is [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1], but in the example, the output is [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,4]. So that doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look for another pattern. Maybe the output is a kind of erosion or dilation, where certain numbers are preserved based on their neighbors. For example, in Example 0, the 1s and 2s that are surrounded by 8s are kept, and the 8s are turned into 0s. So any cluster of numbers not 8 or 0 is extracted and placed in a grid where the surrounding is 0.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as two separate grids stacked vertically. For Example 0, the input has a top section with 8s, then a middle part with 1s and 2s, then lower part with 0s and some 3s. The output seems to combine these two sections. The top part of the output has the middle 1s and 2s, and the lower part has the 3s from the 0 region. So maybe the output is combining two regions from the input: the parts surrounded by 8s and the parts surrounded by 0s, then placing them in the output with 0s around.\n\nBut how to determine which parts to take. For Example 0's input, the middle rows (4th to 11th rows) have 8s on the edges and 1s,2s in the middle. These are extracted and placed in the output's upper rows. Then the lower rows (15th to 28th) have 0s and 3s; the 3s are extracted and placed in the lower part of the output. So the output is a combination of these two regions.\n\nBut how to apply this to the test input. The test input has a section with 4s, then a section with 2s and 8s. So maybe the output will combine parts from the 4 region and the 2 region.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\nFirst 12 rows (0-11) are mostly 4s, with some 1s scattered. Then rows 12-23 are 2s and 8s, with some 1s and 8s. So maybe the output will extract the non-4 and non-2 regions. For example, the 1s in the 4s area and the 8s and 1s in the 2s area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the parts of the input where the background is 4 or 2, and the non-background numbers (like 1,8) are arranged in a new grid.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input has 4s and 8s as backgrounds, and the output includes 4s and some 1s and 2s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input with certain transformations applied. For example, in Example 0, replacing 8s with 0s and 0s with 0s, and then extracting the non-zero regions. But this doesn't explain the structure.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a compression of the input, removing consecutive duplicates. But Example 0's output doesn't seem to do that.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the result of a cellular automaton step, where each cell's new value depends on its neighbors. For example, in the input, certain patterns evolve into the output. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet's try to find a pattern in the Test Input. The Test Input has two main sections: the first 12 rows are mostly 4s, then the next 12 rows are mostly 2s and 8s. In the first section, there are a few 1s in rows 3,4,6,7,8. In the second section, rows 15-23 have 8s and some 1s.\n\nIf following Example 2's pattern, where 4s are part of the output and 8s are replaced with 1s, then maybe the output would merge the 4s regions and the 2s regions, replacing 8s with 1s. But the test input's 2s section has 8s and 2s. Maybe the output will have 2s replaced with another number, like 0, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the first part (4s) and the second part (2s) merged, but with 8s turned into 0s. For example, in rows 15-23, where there are 8s and 2s, the 8s become 0 and 2s remain. But how this fits into the output's structure.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's think of another angle. In all examples, the output seems to have the same dimensions as the input but only certain regions. Wait, no. In Example 1, the input rows are 20 elements long, and the output rows are 10. So the output is half the width. Similarly, in Example 2, the input rows are 16 elements, output 8. So the output is half the width. For the Test Input, which has rows of 12 elements, the output should be 6 elements per row if following the same ratio.\n\nSo, maybe the pattern is to take the first half of each row and then apply some transformation. For Example 1, input rows have 20 elements, output 10. So first half (10 elements) or second half? Looking at Example 1's first input row: [6,...6, followed by ten 1s]. The output's first row is [1,1,...], which matches the last ten elements. So maybe the output is the right half of each input row. For Example 1, this would fit: the output is the right half with 6s replaced by 1s and 8s kept. Let's check:\n\nExample 1's input row 0: right half is ten 1s \u2192 output row 0 is ten 1s. Input row 1: right half is [1,1,1,1,1,8,1,8,1,1] \u2192 output row 1 is [1,1,1,1,1,8,3,8,1,1]. Wait, but where does the 3 come from? The input's left half (first 10 elements) has 6s and in row 2, a 3. Maybe the output combines the right half with some elements from the left. This is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, in Example 1, the output is the right half of each row, but with some processing. For example, replacing 6s in the left half with 1s, but that doesn't explain the presence of 3s. \n\nAnother possibility: the output is the right half of the input rows, but any 6s in the left half are replaced with 1s and merged into the output. But this isn't clear.\n\nLet's look at Example 2 again. Input rows have 16 elements. Output rows have 8. If the output is the left half of the input, but that doesn't fit the data. For instance, the input's second row is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8]. The output's second row is [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,4]. The left half is eight 4s, but the output has four 4s followed by three 1s and a 4. So perhaps the output is combining the left and right halves in some way, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a subsampling of the input, taking every other element. For example, in Example 2's input row 1, taking every other element would give 8 elements. But [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] \u2192 [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4], which matches the output's first row. The second input row's right half is [8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8], every other element would be [8,1,8,8], but the output row is [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,4]. This doesn't align.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's consider that each example's output is a transformed version of certain regions in the input. For instance, in Example 0, the output consists of the two blocks from the input (the 1-2 block and the 3 block) placed in a new grid with 0s. Similarly, Example 1's output is the right half of the input rows, with some modifications. Example 2's output seems to be combining parts of the left and right halves.\n\nFor the Test Input, the first 12 rows are 4s with some 1s, and the next 12 are 2s and 8s with some 1s. The output might take the regions with 1s from the 4s area and the regions with 8s and 1s from the 2s area, and combine them into a new grid. Alternatively, the output could be the 1s from the first part and the 8s from the second part, transformed into certain numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all instances of the first number in each row with 0 and others remain. But in Example 0, the first number is 8, replaced with 0. In Example 1, first number is 6, replaced with 1. In Example 2, first number is 4, which stays 4. So maybe the first number is the background, and is replaced with 0 (or another number) in the output, and other numbers are kept. Let's check:\n\nExample 0: first number is 8, replaced with 0. All 8s become 0s. Yes, the output has 0s where input had 8s.\n\nExample 1: first number is 6, replaced with 1. So all 6s become 1s. The output rows start with 1s. The 8s remain 8. The 3s stay 3. This fits.\n\nExample 2: first number is 4, which stays 4. The output rows start with 4s. The 8s in the input are replaced with 1s. Because in the input's second row, the right half has 8s, which become 1s in the output. So the rule could be:\n\n- Replace the background number (first number of the input) with 0 (or another number based on the example) in the output.\n\n- Other numbers are kept as is.\n\nBut in Example 0, the first number is 8, replaced with 0. In Example 1, first number is 6, replaced with 1. In Example 2, first number is 4, remains 4. So this doesn't form a consistent rule. Unless the replacement depends on the example. That seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the background number is replaced with 0, and other numbers are kept. But in Example 0, 8 becomes 0. In Example 1, 6 becomes 0, but the output has 1s, which contradicts. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: the output is created by taking clusters of numbers not equal to the first number of the input and arranging them in the output. For example:\n\n- In Example 0, the first number is 8. Any cluster not 8 is kept. The 0s are part of the background, so maybe the clusters are the 1s, 2s, and 3s.\n\n- In Example 1, first number is 6. Clusters not 6 are kept (1s, 3s, 8s).\n\n- In Example 2, first number is 4. Clusters not 4 are kept (8s, 1s, 2s, 6s).\n\nBut how are these clusters arranged in the output? In Example 0's output, the 1-2 clusters are placed in the middle, and the 3 clusters are below. In Example 1's output, the clusters are arranged in the same order as the input. Example 2's output seems to combine the left and right parts, but it's unclear.\n\nMaybe the output is created by taking all non-background clusters (not the first number) and placing them sequentially, centered, with background as 0 (or another value). For the Test Input, the background for the first part is 4, and for the second part is 2. So the output would have clusters of 1s and 8s from both parts.\n\nBut this is speculative. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a pattern in the test input based on the examples.\n\nIn the Test Input, the first part has rows of 4s with some 1s. The second part has 2s and 8s. If following Example 2's pattern, where 4s are kept, and 8s are replaced with 1s, then the output's first part would be rows of 4s with 1s where they are in the input. The second part's 2s are kept, and 8s replaced with 1s. But how this is structured.\n\nAlternatively, each row in the output is formed by taking the non-background elements. For example, for rows 0-11 (background 4), output the 1s and surrounding 4s. For rows 12-23 (background 2), output the 8s and 1s, replacing 8s with 1s or something else.\n\nBut this is still unclear. Given that the examples show outputs with certain sections extracted and possibly merged, maybe the Test Input's output is formed by taking the regions with 1s and 8s, transforming the 8s to 0s, and arranging them in a new grid.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's challenging. Given the examples, the Test Input's output might look like this:\n\nFor the first part (rows with 4s and 1s), extract the 1s and their positions, replacing 4s with 0. For the second part (rows with 2s and 8s), replace 2s with 0 and 8s with 1, then extract the 1s and remaining numbers. Then combine these into a new grid.\n\nAlternatively, for each row in the Test Input, split it into two halves. For the first half (first 6 elements of 12), replace 4 with 0 and keep 1. For the second half (last 6), replace 2 with 0 and 8 with 1. Then combine them into a new row of 12 elements, but the output examples suggest shorter rows. Maybe it's the case where the output is the non-background elements, with background replaced by 0.\n\nFor instance, in the Test Input's row 3: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,4,4]. The output might be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], but since the examples show shorter outputs, perhaps they are trimmed to only the non-zero parts.\n\nBut the examples' outputs have varying lengths. For Example 0, the output rows are 17 elements long, same as the input. So maybe the background is replaced with 0, and other numbers are kept. For Example 0's input, 8 becomes 0, and 0 becomes 0. For Example 1's input, 6 becomes 1, 8 stays 8, and 0 is not present. For Example 2's input, 4 stays 4, 8 becomes 1.\n\nIf this is the case, then for the Test Input:\n\n- In the first part (rows 0-11), replace 4 with 0, keep 1 as 1.\n\n- In the second part (rows 12-23), replace 2 with 0, 8 with 1, keep 1 as 1.\n\nSo for example, row 3 of the Test Input: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,4,4] \u2192 replace 4s with 0, keep 1 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. Then trim trailing zeros to match the example's output lengths. But the examples don't trim; they keep the full length. Alternatively, the output has the same dimensions as the input, but with backgrounds replaced.\n\nBut the output examples have varying row lengths. For instance, Example 1's output rows are shorter than the input's. This suggests that the transformation may involve taking only certain parts of the input rows, like the right half or left half, then replacing certain values.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make an educated guess based on the examples. The pattern seems to involve taking the non-background elements (those not the first element of the input rows) and placing them in the output, possibly centering them, and replacing the background with 0. For the Test Input, the first part's background is 4, which would be replaced with 0. The 1s are kept. The second part's background is 2, replaced with 0. The 8s become 1, and the existing 1s are kept.\n\nApplying this:\n\nFor rows 0-11 (background 4), replace 4 with 0. So each row becomes mostly 0s, with 1s where they exist. For example, row 3 becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. \n\nFor rows 12-23 (background 2), replace 2 with 0, 8 with 1. So rows 15-23 become:\n\nRow 15: [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 16: [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0] but with a 1 where the input has an 8.\n\nWait, the Test Input's row 15 is [2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2]. Replacing 2 with 0 and 8 with 1 gives [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]. \n\nRow 16: [2,2,2,8,8,8,1,8,2,2,2,2] \u2192 [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0] but the input has a 1 in the middle. So [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0] becomes [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0], but the 1 would stay as 1. Wait, if the rule is to replace 8 with 1, and keep 1, then row 16 would be [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nSimilarly, row 20: [2,1,8,2,2,2,8,8,1,8,8,2] \u2192 replace 2s with 0, 8s with 1, keep 1 \u2192 [0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0].\n\nBut the output examples have varying row lengths, so perhaps the output is the non-zero elements. For instance, row 3's output would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 trimmed to [1], but the examples don't show trimming. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-background elements and aligning them to the left or center. For example, in Example 0, the middle block is centered. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll proceed to construct the output for the Test Input based on the following steps:\n\n1. For each row in the input, determine the background number (the first element).\n\n2. Replace the background number with 0.\n\n3. Replace other numbers according to a rule:\n\n- In Example 0, 8 (background) \u2192 0, 0 (new background) \u2192 0.\n\n- In Example 1, 6 \u2192 1, other numbers (1,3,8) stay.\n\n- In Example 2, 4 stays, 8 \u2192 1, others (2,1,6) stay.\n\nSo for the Test Input:\n\n- Rows 0-11: background is 4 \u2192 replace 4 with 0. 1 remains 1.\n\n- Rows 12-23: background is 2 \u2192 replace 2 with 0. 8 becomes 1. 1 remains 1.\n\nSo converting each row:\n\nRow 0: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: same as row 0 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: same \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,4,4] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,4] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: all 4s \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [4,4,4,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] \u2192 [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [4,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] \u2192 [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [4,4,4,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] \u2192 [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRows 9-11: all 4s \u2192 [0s]\n\nRows 12-14: all 2s \u2192 [0s]\n\nRow 15: [2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2] \u2192 [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 16: [2,2,2,8,8,8,1,8,2,2,2,2] \u2192 [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 17: [2,2,2,8,8,8,8,1,2,2,2,2] \u2192 [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 18: all 2s \u2192 [0s]\n\nRow 19: [2,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2] \u2192 [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 20: [2,1,8,2,2,2,8,8,1,8,8,2] \u2192 [0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nRow 21: [2,8,8,2,2,2,1,8,8,8,8,2] \u2192 [0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nRow 22: [2,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,1,8,8,2] \u2192 [0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nRow 23: all 2s \u2192 [0s]\n\nNow, the output would be the above transformed rows. But considering the examples' outputs have varying lengths and sometimes shorter rows, perhaps the output is a trimmed version where trailing 0s are removed. But looking at the examples:\n\n- Example 0's output has rows of 17 elements, same as input.\n\n- Example 1's output has shorter rows, suggesting that perhaps the right half is taken and transformed.\n\nGiven that, maybe the Test Input's output is the transformed rows as is, without trimming. However, Example 2's output rows are shorter than the input's, so perhaps there's another step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the left half of each transformed row. For the Test Input's transformed rows, each has 12 elements. Taking the left half (6 elements):\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,1]\n\nWait, no. Alternatively, maybe the output is centered around the non-zero elements, but this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the transformed rows as per the rules derived from the examples, replacing backgrounds and certain numbers, and present the output in the same structure as the examples, likely with rows of the same length as the input but with transformed values.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the goal is to transform the input into the output following some rule. Let's start by analyzing each example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is a large grid with a lot of 8s and 0s, and some 1s, 2s, 3s. The output seems to be a smaller grid. Wait, the input has 29 rows, and the output has 15 rows. So maybe it's taking a section of the input? But how?\n\nLooking at the output rows of Example 0, some of them look like parts of the input. For instance, the second output row is [0,0,...,1,1,1,2,1,...], which matches part of row 4 in the input. Similarly, the third output row matches row 5 of the input. So maybe the output is extracting certain rows from the input where there are non-zero and non-8 numbers, and then shifting them to the center? But also, the output in Example 0 replaces some 8s with 0s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about cropping the input grid to focus on regions that have numbers other than the background (like 8 or 0). The output seems to be a cropped version, keeping the parts with 1,2,3 and replacing the 8s with 0s. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 1's input has rows with 6s and 1s, and some 3s, 8s, 2s. The output is a shorter array. The input has 11 rows, and the output has 11 rows but each row is shorter. The output rows seem to be the rightmost part of the input rows. For example, the first input row ends with ten 1s, and the first output row starts with 1s and then has 3,3,3. Wait, looking at the input rows for Example 1, maybe the output is taking the part of each row after the 6s. For instance, the input rows start with six 6s, then other numbers. The output rows have 10 elements, which matches the part after the 6s (the input row is 20 elements, but after the first 10 6s, the next 10 elements are the 1s and others). Wait, no, in the first input row of Example 1, the length is 20: [6,...,6,1,...,1]. The output rows are 10 elements. So maybe each output row is taking the last 10 elements of each input row, but then processing them. But looking at the first output row of Example 1: [1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,1,1]. The input row's last 10 elements are [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], but the output has 3s. Wait, that doesn't align. So maybe not just taking the last part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about focusing on certain regions where the numbers change. For example, in Example 0, the output seems to capture the parts where the numbers 1,2,3 are present, and the 8s are turned into 0s, but arranged in a way that's centered. The output rows in Example 0 have non-zero elements in the middle, surrounded by zeros. So perhaps it's taking certain rows and columns that contain non-8 (for the first part) or non-0 (for the latter part) and centering them in a smaller grid.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input and output, the output has a lot of zeros. The input's top part has rows filled with 8s and some rows with 1,2,3. The output's non-zero rows are in the middle. For example, output row 1 (0-based) is [0s...1,1,1,2,1...], which corresponds to input row 4. But in the input, row 4 is part of the upper section (with 8s). Then in the lower part of the input (rows starting with 0s), there are some 3s. The output's lower rows have some 3s as well. Maybe the output is combining two parts: the upper part (from the 8s section) and the lower part (from the 0s section) of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a kind of overlay where certain regions are taken from the input and placed into a new grid. For instance, in Example 0, the upper part of the input (rows 4 and 5) have patterns that are placed in the output rows 1 and 2. Then the lower part of the input (rows 8-10) have patterns that are placed in output rows 9-12. The rest of the output rows are zeros. So perhaps the output is combining these two regions from the input, centering them, and replacing 8s with 0s and 0s with 0s.\n\nIn Example 1, the output seems to have rows that are a combination of the 6s and the 1s regions. But the output rows are shorter. Looking at the input rows of Example 1, each row starts with several 6s followed by numbers. The output rows in Example 1 have elements that look like parts from the middle of the input rows. For example, the first output row is [1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,1,1]. Looking at the input's first row, after the 6s, there are ten 1s. So that doesn't match. But maybe the output is taking a vertical slice. Alternatively, maybe the output is a transposed version or a rotated version.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is a form of run-length encoding or some kind of pattern extraction. But looking at the outputs, the numbers in the output are similar to the inputs but arranged differently.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2, the input has 4s, 8s, and some 1s, 2s. The output seems to have some 4s and then the numbers from the 8s part. For example, the second row of the input is [4s..., 8,1,1,1,8...], and the output's second row is [4s..., 1,1,1,4]. So maybe the 8s are replaced with 4s, and the numbers between 8s are kept. But how? Also, in row 7 of the input, there's an 8 followed by 1,1,6,8. The output's row 8 is [1,1,6,4,4,4,4,4], so the 8s are replaced with 4s again. So perhaps the output is taking the 4s from the left part and the 8s from the right part, merging them by replacing 8s with 4s, but only in certain positions.\n\nWait, Example 2's input has two main sections: the left part is mostly 4s, and the right part is 8s with some numbers in between. The output seems to merge these two parts. For example, in the input's second row, after the 4s, there's 8,1,1,1,8,... which in the output becomes 1,1,1,4. So perhaps the output is combining the left 4s and the right numbers (from the 8s part), replacing 8s with 4s. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of the left half and the right half of the input, but only taking certain parts. For example, in Example 2, the input rows are 16 elements long. The output rows are 8 elements. So maybe the first half (8 elements) of the input is combined with the non-8 parts of the right half. But looking at the second input row: after the first 8 4s, the next part is 8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8. The output row is [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,4]. So perhaps the 8s are replaced with 4s (the left part's value) except where there are other numbers. So the 8s in the right half are replaced with the left part's leading number (4), and the non-8 numbers are kept. Then, the output row is the left part's first 4 elements (4s) plus the right part's non-8 elements, replacing 8s with 4s. But how?\n\nWait, the input row for Example 2, first row is [4*8, 8*8]. Output row is [4*8], which is the left part. Second input row is [4*8, 8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8]. Output row is [4*4, 1,1,1,4]. So the left 4s are kept as 4, and the right part is [8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8] which becomes [1,1,1,4]. So it's taking the non-8 elements from the right part and appending them to the left part's first 4 elements? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the left part (first 8 elements) but where the right part (next 8 elements) has non-8 elements, those replace the left part's elements. For example, in the second row, the right part has 8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8. The non-8s here are 1,1,1. So the left part's last three elements (positions 5,6,7) which were 4s are replaced with 1,1,1, and the 8s in the right part are ignored. But the output row is [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,4]. Wait, the output's fifth element is 1, sixth is 1, seventh is 1, eighth is 4. The original left part's eighth element is 4. So maybe the non-8 elements from the right part are placed starting from position 5 (assuming 0-based or 1-based). Hmm, that's a possibility. But how is the fourth element in the output row still 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is combining the left and right parts, but in the right part, any non-8 element is kept, and 8s are replaced with the corresponding left part's element. For example, in the second row of Example 2's input, the right part is [8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8]. The left part is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. So for each element in the right part, if it's 8, take the left part's element, else take the right part's. Then, concatenate the left part and the processed right part. But the output row is 8 elements long, which is the same as the left part. So perhaps it's the left part plus the processed right part, but only up to the same length. Wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe the output is the left part's elements, but wherever the right part has non-8 elements, those replace the left's elements. For example, in the second input row, the right part has 1s starting at position 9 (if 0-based), which would correspond to positions 9-11. But the left part is 8 elements (positions 0-7). So maybe the right part's elements are mapped to the left part's positions beyond a certain point? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the left half (first 8 elements) and the right half (last 8 elements), but in the right half, replacing 8s with the left half's corresponding element. Then, merging the left half and the processed right half, but only up to the original length. But in Example 2's output, the second row is [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,4]. The left half is [4*8], and the right half's non-8 elements are at positions 9,10,11 (1,1,1), which would be the fifth, sixth, seventh elements in the right half. So perhaps these replace the left half's fifth, sixth, seventh elements (which were 4,4,4) with 1,1,1. Then, the eighth element (position 7) in the left half (4) is kept. So the output is [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,4]. That fits. Then the third input row of Example 2 is [4*8, 8,2,1,1,8,8,8,8]. The right half's elements are 8,2,1,1,8,8,8,8. The non-8s are 2,1,1. So positions 9 (8?), wait no. Wait the input row is [4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4,8,2,1,1,8,8,8,8]. The right half is positions 8-15: 8,2,1,1,8,8,8,8. So non-8s are 2,1,1 at positions 9,10,11. So in the output, the left half's positions 9-11 (but the left half is 0-7, so perhaps the right half's positions 0-7 (the first 8 of the right half). Wait, perhaps the right half is processed by replacing 8s with the left half's elements. For example, for each element in the right half, if it's 8, take the corresponding element from the left half (same index within the left half). Otherwise, take the element. Then merge them.\n\nBut in the second input row of Example 2, the right half is [8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8]. The left half is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. So for the right half's elements:\n\nRight[0] =8 \u2192 take left[0] \u21924\n\nRight[1] =1 \u2192 keep 1\n\nRight[2] =1 \u2192 keep 1\n\nRight[3] =1 \u2192 keep 1\n\nRight[4] =8 \u2192 take left[4] \u21924\n\nRight[5-7] =8 \u2192 take left[5-7] \u21924,4,4\n\nSo the processed right half would be [4,1,1,1,4,4,4,4]. Then, the output is the left half plus the processed right half, but since the output is only 8 elements, maybe it's combining them. Wait, but the output for the second row is [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,4], which has 4,4,4,4,1,1,1,4. That's 8 elements. If the left half is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] and the processed right half is [4,1,1,1,4,4,4,4], then perhaps the output is taking the left half's first four elements and the processed right half's next four elements? So first four 4s, then the next four from the processed right half (1,1,1,4). That matches. So the output is the left half's first half (4 elements) and the processed right half's next four elements. But how does that work for other rows?\n\nLooking at the third input row of Example 2: left half is [4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4], right half is [8,2,1,1,8,8,8,8]. Processed right half would be [4,2,1,1,4,4,4,4]. Then taking left half's first four (4,4,4,4), and processed right half's next four (2,1,1,4). So output would be [4,4,4,4,2,1,1,4], which matches the third output row of Example 2: [4,4,4,4,2,1,1,4]. That fits. So the pattern seems to be: for each row in the input, split into left and right halves. For the right half, replace each 8 with the corresponding element from the left half (same index). Then take the first four elements of the left half and the first four elements of the processed right half (excluding the first four?), or perhaps the first four of the left and the next four of the processed right. Wait, in Example 2, the output row is formed by taking the first four elements of the left half and the first four elements of the processed right half's next four. Wait, let's see:\n\nOriginal left half (8 elements): [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nProcessed right half (after replacing 8s with left's elements): [4,1,1,1,4,4,4,4]\n\nThen the output row is first four elements from the left (4,4,4,4) plus first four from processed right (4,1,1,1) \u2192 no, that would be 8 elements. But the output row is [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,4]. Wait, the processed right half's first four elements are [4,1,1,1]. The output row is first four from left (4,4,4,4) plus next four from processed right (1,1,1,4). Wait, but how is the fourth element in the processed right half 1? Wait, no. The processed right half's first four elements are [4,1,1,1], then the next four are [4,4,4,4]. So combining left's first four (4,4,4,4) and processed right's first four (4,1,1,1) would give [4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1], which doesn't match the output. But the actual output is [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,4]. So maybe it's a different combination. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the left half's first four elements and the processed right half's last four elements. For the second example's processed right half [4,1,1,1,4,4,4,4], taking the last four (4,4,4,4) would make the output [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4], which is not the case. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the left half's first four elements and the non-8 elements from the right half. But in the second input row, the right half's non-8 elements are 1,1,1. So adding those to the first four 4s would give [4,4,4,4,1,1,1], but the output has 8 elements. Hmm. This is getting confusing. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input rows start with 6s and then have other numbers. The output rows are shorter. Looking at the first output row: [1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,1,1]. How does this relate to the input's first row? The input's first row is [6*10, 1*10]. The output row is 10 elements. Maybe the output is taking the right part (after the 6s) and processing it. But the input's first row's right part is all 1s, but the output's first row has 3,3,3. So that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the output is taking the right part and replacing 6s (but there are no 6s in the right part). Alternatively, the output rows in Example 1 have elements from the middle of the input rows. For instance, in input row 2 of Example 1: [6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. The output row is [1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,1,1]. Wait, maybe the output is taking the last 10 elements (positions 10-19) and replacing 6s with 1s? But in the input row, positions 10-19 are all 1s. So that doesn't explain the 3s. Alternatively, maybe the output is combining parts of the input rows where there are non-6 and non-8 elements. For example, in the input row 2 of Example 1, the elements after the 6s are all 1s, but the output row has 3,3,3. That doesn't align. \n\nThis approach might not be working. Let's think differently. Maybe the transformation is about removing certain numbers (like 8s and 0s) and shifting the remaining elements to the center, padding with zeros (or another number). For example, in Example 0, the output is centered, with non-zero elements in the middle and zeros around. The input rows that have 8s are turned into zeros, and the rows with 0s are also turned into zeros except where there are 3s. But how to explain the merging?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of two regions from the input. For instance, in Example 0, the upper part (rows with 8s) and lower part (rows with 0s) each have regions with 1,2,3. The output seems to arrange those regions in the center. So maybe the output is created by taking the non-8 regions from the upper part and non-0 regions from the lower part, aligning them, and centering them in the output grid. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum or overlay of two matrices. But how would that work with the given examples?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the Test Input, which has rows of 4s and 2s, then some 8s and 1s. The Test Input's last few rows are 2s with some 8s and 1s. The expected output would follow the same pattern as the training examples. For example, the Test Input's rows after row 12 are filled with 2s and then 8s and 1s. Following Example 2's pattern, perhaps the output for these rows would take the left part (2s) and the right part (8s and others), replace 8s with 2s, and combine them in a certain way.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's try to find a common pattern across all examples.\n\nExample 0's input has two main regions: upper with 8s and lower with 0s. The output seems to combine parts from these regions. For instance, the output has rows that correspond to the upper region's patterns (like rows with 1s and 2s) and the lower region's patterns (like 3s), centered and surrounded by 0s.\n\nExample 1's output rows seem to have a mix of numbers from different parts of the input rows. For instance, the output rows have 3s and 2s which were present in the middle of the input rows. The output rows are shorter, suggesting that the transformation involves cropping or extracting a specific section from each row.\n\nExample 2's output takes the left part of the input (4s) and the right part (8s replaced with 4s), combining them into a row that's shorter. It seems like the right part's non-8 elements are merged into the left part.\n\nPutting this together, maybe the transformation is: For each row in the input, take the non-background elements (where background is a certain number, like 8 or 0) and center them in the output row, padding with the background value. But the background varies: in Example 0, the upper part's background is 8, lower part is 0. The output uses 0 as background. So perhaps the output is combining elements from both sections, with the background being 0.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where certain regions from the input are preserved, and others are replaced with zeros (or another value). For example, in Example 0, the upper part's 1,2,3 elements are placed in the middle of the output with 0s around, and the lower part's 3s are also placed in the middle.\n\nBut this is still unclear. Let's think of each example's output in terms of their input.\n\nExample 0's output has 15 rows. The input has 29 rows. The output rows 1 and 2 correspond to input rows 4 and 5. The output rows 9-12 correspond to input rows 8-11. The rest are zeros. So maybe the output is combining two regions from the input: upper and lower, centering them in the output grid.\n\nExample 1's input has 11 rows. The output also has 11 rows. The output rows seem to be taking certain elements from the middle of the input rows. For example, the first output row's 3,3,3 may come from the third input row's 3,3,3.\n\nBut how? The input's third row starts with 6,6,8,3,8,6..., and the output's first row is [1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,1,1]. The 3s here might come from the middle of the input row. But how to extract that.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a horizontal slice. For example, in Example 1, the output is a vertical slice from columns 10-19 (the right part) but replacing 6s with 1s and 8s with something. But the output's first row has 3,3,3 which are not present in the input's first row's right part.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's think of the Test Input and see if we can find a pattern there.\n\nTest Input has 24 rows. The first part is rows of 4s with some 1s, and the second part is rows of 2s with some 8s and 1s. The output should follow the pattern of the training examples. Let's assume that the output will merge the left and right parts, replacing 8s with the left part's value (like in Example 2).\n\nFor example, in the Test Input's rows 15-23:\n\nRow 15: [2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow 16: [2,2,2,8,8,8,1,8,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow 17: [2,2,2,8,8,8,8,1,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow 19: [2,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow 20: [2,1,8,2,2,2,8,8,1,8,8,2]\n\nRow 21: [2,8,8,2,2,2,1,8,8,8,8,2]\n\nRow 22: [2,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,1,8,8,2]\n\nAssuming each row is split into left and right parts. For example, row 15 is 12 elements, so left part could be first 6 elements, right part next 6. But in Example 2, each row was 16 elements, split into 8 and 8. For Test Input's rows of 12 elements, maybe split into left 6 and right 6.\n\nThen, for each element in the right part, if it's 8, replace with the left part's corresponding element (same index). Then combine left and processed right parts. But the output rows in Example 2 had 8 elements, which is the same as the left part. So perhaps the output is the left part plus the processed right part, but only up to a certain length.\n\nBut in the Test Input's row 15, left part is [2,2,2,8,8,8], right part is [8,8,2,2,2,2]. Wait, no. Wait the Test Input's row 15 is [2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2]. Split into left 6 and right 6: left is [2,2,2,8,8,8], right is [8,8,2,2,2,2]. Then, processing the right part: replace 8s with left's elements. For example:\n\nRight part indices 0:8 \u2192 replace with left[0] =2\n\nRight part index 1:8 \u2192 replace with left[1]=2\n\nRight part index 2:2 \u2192 keep 2\n\nRight part index 3:2 \u2192 keep 2\n\nRight part index 4:2 \u2192 keep 2\n\nRight part index 5:2 \u2192 keep 2\n\nSo processed right part becomes [2,2,2,2,2,2]. Then combining left and processed right parts would give [2,2,2,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2], but the output row is shorter. But in Example 2, the output rows were the same length as the left part. So perhaps the output is only the left part plus the first few elements of the processed right part. For Test Input row 15, which is 12 elements, perhaps the output is left part (6) plus processed right part (6), but merged in a way that the total is 8 elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is formed by taking the left part and the processed right part, but only taking non-8 elements. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: look for the Test Input's structure. The first 12 rows are all 4s except for a few 1s. Then the next 12 rows are 2s with some 8s and 1s. Following Example 2's pattern, where the output combined left and right parts, replacing 8s with the left part's value (4 in that case), perhaps in the Test Input, the output for the first part (4s) would merge the left and right parts, replacing any 8s in the right part with 4s. But in the Test Input's first 12 rows, there are no 8s. The 8s are in the lower part (rows 15 onwards). So for the first 12 rows, the output would be the left part and the processed right part (but since no 8s, they remain as 4s). But the Test Input's first few rows are all 4s except some 1s. For example, row 3 has a 1 in position 7. So the output for row 3 would have the left part (first 6 elements) as 4s, and the right part (elements 7-11) being [4,4,4,4,4,4] (assuming the right part is 6 elements). But the input row 3 is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,4,4]. So left part is first 6: [4,4,4,4,4,4], right part is [4,1,4,4,4,4]. Processing the right part: replace 8s with 4s, but there are no 8s here. So processed right part is same as original. Then the output would be left part plus processed right part. But the output length in Example 2 was same as the left part's length, which was 8. But in Test Input's case, the left part is 6, right part 6. So maybe the output is the left part's first 6 elements plus the processed right part's first 2 elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for the Test Input's rows, if the pattern is to split each row into two parts and take the left part where the right part is 8. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on Example 2. The Test Input's lower part has rows with 2s and 8s. For example, row 15: [2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2]. If the output is processed similarly to Example 2, the left part is [2,2,2,8,8,8], and the right part is [8,8,2,2,2,2]. Processing the right part's 8s by replacing them with the left part's corresponding elements. For example, right part's first element (8) is replaced with left[0]=2. The second 8 is replaced with left[1]=2. The third element is 2 (stays). So processed right part becomes [2,2,2,2,2,2]. Then combining left and processed right parts would give [2,2,2,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2], but the output's length may be shorter. However, in Example 2, the output rows were the same length as the left part. For example, Example 2's input rows were 16 elements, left part 8, output 8 elements. So for Test Input's row 15 (12 elements), output may be 6 elements (left part's first 6) plus processed right part's first 6 elements, but that's 12 elements. But the output examples in the training sets are shorter. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the left part and the processed right part, but only up to the original row's length. For Example 2's input row, the left part was 8 elements and the processed right part was 8 elements, but the output was 8 elements. So maybe the output is the left part merged with the processed right part, but taking elements from left and right such that the output is the same length as the input row. But in Example 2's case, the output rows were the same length as the left part (8 elements), but the input rows were 16 elements. So perhaps the output is the left part merged with the processed right part, but taking the same number of elements as the left part. For example, left part is 8 elements, processed right part is 8 elements. Output takes 8 elements: perhaps the first half from the left and the second half from the processed right. \n\nFor the Test Input's row 15: left part is first 6 elements [2,2,2,8,8,8], processed right part is [2,2,2,2,2,2]. Output would be first 3 elements from left and last 3 from processed right: [2,2,2,2,2,2], but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, take first half of left and first half of processed right. Left part has 6 elements, first half is 3, processed right is 6 elements, first half 3. So output is [2,2,2,2,2,2]. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the processed right part, replacing 8s with the left part's corresponding elements, then taking the first few elements. But I'm not making progress here.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on Example 2. For each row in the Test Input:\n\n- Split the row into left and right halves. For even length, like 12, split into left 6 and right 6.\n\n- For each element in the right half, if it's 8, replace it with the corresponding element from the left half (same index). Otherwise, keep it.\n\n- Combine the left half and the processed right half into a new row. But the output length might be the same as the input.\n\nWait, but in Example 2's case, the output rows are 8 elements, which is the same as the left half's length (8). So perhaps the output is only the left half plus the processed right half's first few elements, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the left half and the processed right half, but only up to the original left half's length. For example, if the left half is 6 elements and the processed right half is 6, the output is 6 elements from the left half and 6 from the processed right, totaling 12, but the training examples show shorter outputs. \n\nAlternatively, the output is the left half with some elements replaced by the processed right half's elements. For instance, in Example 2's second row, the output is [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,4], which is the left half's first four elements and the processed right half's first four elements. So for a row of 12 elements, left half 6, processed right 6, output might be left's first 3 and processed right's first 3, making 6 elements. But this is just a guess.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input's row 3: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,4,4]. Left half: first 6 elements [4,4,4,4,4,4]. Right half: [4,1,4,4,4,4]. Processed right half (replace 8s with left's elements, but there are no 8s here. So processed right is same as original. The output row would then be [4,4,4,4,4,4] (left half) plus [4,1,4,4,4,4] (processed right), but the output would be the entire row. But the training examples have outputs shorter than the input. So perhaps the output is the left half's elements plus the non-8 elements from the processed right half. But in this case, the output would be longer than the input.\n\nThis is not making sense. Given that I'm stuck, I'll try to look for another pattern. Let's consider that the output is the part of the input where the background numbers (like 8, 0, 6) are replaced with 0 or another number, and the non-background elements are centered.\n\nIn Example 0, the output replaces 8s with 0s and centers the non-zero elements. For example, the input's row 4 has [8,8,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. The output's row 1 is [0s...,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0s...]. So the non-8 elements are centered, and 8s are replaced with 0s. Similarly, the lower part of the input has rows with 0s and some 3s. The output rows for those have the 3s centered with 0s around.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each row, take the non-background elements (like 8 or 0), center them in the output row, and replace the background with 0. But the background varies between sections of the input.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the upper part has 8 as the background, lower part has 0. The output uses 0 as the background, so the upper non-8 elements are centered, and the lower non-0 elements are centered.\n\nSo, for the Test Input:\n\nThe first part (rows 0-11) have 4 as the main number, with some 1s. The background here could be 4. The output would replace 4s with 0s and center the non-4 elements (like 1s). The second part (rows 12-23) have 2 as the main number, with some 8s and 1s. The background here is 2, and 8s would be replaced with 0 or 2. But in Example 2, the 8s were replaced with the left part's value (4), not 0.\n\nThis is conflicting. Maybe the background is different for each part. For example, in the Test Input's first part (4s), the output would replace 4s with 0 and center the 1s. For the second part (2s), replace 2s with 0 and center the 8s and 1s, but 8s might be replaced with 0s.\n\nBut in Example 2, the output replaced 8s with the left part's number (4). So maybe the background is determined by the dominant number in the row. For instance, in a row dominated by 4s, replace 8s with 4s and center the non-4s.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time I've spent, I'll try to apply the following approach for the Test Input:\n\nFor each row, if the row starts with 4s, then replace any 8s with 4 and center the non-4 elements. For rows starting with 2s, replace 8s with 2 and center the non-2 elements.\n\nLooking at row 3 of the Test Input: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,4,4]. The non-4 element is 1. So center this 1 in the output row. The output row would be [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] if the output length is same as input. But the training example outputs are shorter. Alternatively, maybe the output is shorter by trimming leading and trailing background elements. For example, the non-4 elements are grouped and centered, and the output row is shorter. But the training examples show varying output lengths. \n\nAlternatively, the output for each row is the non-background elements, centered, and padded with the background value. For example, row 3 of Test Input's first part would have output [4,4,4,1,4,4,4,4] but this doesn't fit with Example 2's output.\n\nGiven the time I'm taking and the competition setting, I'll proceed with the following guess: For each row, replace 8s with the background number (e.g., 4 for rows starting with 4s, 2 for rows starting with 2s), then center the non-background elements and pad with zeros. Alternatively, center the non-background elements in the output, which is shorter. \n\nBut since the Test Input's output should follow the format of the training examples, which for Example 2 had output rows of 8 elements when input was 16, perhaps the output rows are half the length of the input rows. For Test Input's 12-element rows, output would be 6 elements. For each row, take the non-background elements (like 4 or 2), center them in 6 elements, and pad with 0s. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the non-background elements from each row, centered and padded with 0s. For example, in Test Input's row 3, the only non-4 element is 1. The output row would be [0,0,0,1,0,0]. For row 6, which has a 1 in position 3, output would be [0,0,1,0,0,0].\n\nBut looking at Example 0's output, the non-zero elements are centered. For instance, output row 1 is [0s...,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0s...], which is a 17-element row with the pattern centered. So perhaps the output rows are the same length as the input rows, but centered. But the training examples have outputs with varying lengths. For Example 0, the input was 17 elements per row, output also 17. Example 1's input was 20 elements, output 10. Example 2's input was 16, output 8. So the output length is half of the input length. \n\nAh! That's a pattern. Example 0's input rows are 17 elements, output rows are 17 elements. Wait, no. Example 0's output rows are 17 elements. But Example 1's input rows are 20 elements, output rows are 10. Example 2's input rows are 16 elements, output rows 8. So output length is input length divided by 2. Example 1's input rows are 20 elements, output 10. Example 2's input 16, output 8. Example 0's input rows are 17, which is odd. Output is 17 elements. So maybe that's an exception.\n\nBut Test Input's rows are 12 elements, so output rows would be 6 elements. Let's test this:\n\nFor Test Input row 3: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,4,4]. Input length 12, output length 6. The non-4 element is 1. Centered in 6 elements: [0,0,0,1,0,0].\n\nFor row 20: [2,1,8,2,2,2,8,8,1,8,8,2]. Input length 12, output length 6. Replace 8s with 2 (background) and non-2 elements are 1,1. Centered: [0,0,1,1,0,0].\n\nBut how does this align with the training examples?\n\nExample 2's input row 2: [4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4,8,2,1,1,8,8,8,8]. Input length 16, output 8. Output row is [4,4,4,4,2,1,1,4]. The non-4 and non-8 elements are 2,1,1. But in the output, they're placed in positions 4,5,6. Centered in 8 elements would require them to be in positions 3,4,5. So this doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, this approach might not be correct.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make a final guess. The pattern is that the output is the right half of each input row, with 8s replaced by the left part's corresponding element. For example, in Example 2's row 2, the right half is [8,2,1,1,8,8,8,8]. Replacing 8s with left's elements (4s) gives [4,2,1,1,4,4,4,4]. The output row is [4,4,4,4,2,1,1,4], which is the left part's first four elements (4,4,4,4) and the processed right part's first four elements (2,1,1,4). \n\nApplying this to the Test Input's rows:\n\nFor row 15: [2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2]. Left part first 6 elements [2,2,2,8,8,8], right part [8,8,2,2,2,2]. Replacing 8s in right part with left's elements:\n\nRight[0] =8 \u2192 left[0]=2\n\nRight[1] =8 \u2192 left[1]=2\n\nRight[2] =2 \u2192 keep 2\n\nRight[3] =2 \u2192 keep 2\n\nRight[4] =2 \u2192 keep 2\n\nRight[5] =2 \u2192 keep 2\n\nProcessed right part: [2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nOutput row would be left's first 3 elements [2,2,2] and processed right's first 3 [2,2,2], combined to [2,2,2,2,2,2].\n\nBut how does this fit into the output's row length? For Test Input's rows of 12, the output would be 6 elements. So perhaps each output row is formed by taking the left half's first 3 elements and the processed right half's first 3 elements.\n\nFor row 20: [2,1,8,2,2,2,8,8,1,8,8,2]. Left half: [2,1,8,2,2,2]. Right half: [8,8,1,8,8,2]. Processed right half:\n\nRight[0] =8 \u2192 left[0]=2\n\nRight[1] =8 \u2192 left[1]=1\n\nRight[2] =1 \u2192 keep\n\nRight[3] =8 \u2192 left[3]=2\n\nRight[4] =8 \u2192 left[4]=2\n\nRight[5] =2 \u2192 keep\n\nProcessed right half: [2,1,1,2,2,2]. Output row would be left's first 3 [2,1,8] and processed right's first 3 [2,1,1], combined to [2,1,8,2,1,1]. But this doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by combining the left and processed right halves, but the left is the first half and the right is processed as described. For example, row 20's processed right half is [2,1,1,2,2,2], so combining left [2,1,8,2,2,2] and right processed gives [2,1,8,2,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,2], but output is 6 elements. So take first 6 elements: [2,1,8,2,2,2]. But this doesn't seem right.\n\nAt this point, I'm not confident in the pattern. However, given the time, I'll proceed to write an answer based on Example 2's pattern: for each row, split into left and right halves. Replace 8s in the right half with the corresponding left half's elements. Then, the output is the left half plus the processed right half, but only up to the original left half's length. For the Test Input, each row has 12 elements, left half 6, right half 6. Process the right half, then combine left and processed right, but take the first 6 elements of the combined list.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Applying this to row 15:\n\nLeft half: [2,2,2,8,8,8]\n\nRight half: [8,8,2,2,2,2]\n\nProcessed right half: [2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nCombined: [2,2,2,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nOutput row: first 6 elements: [2,2,2,8,8,8]. But this doesn't match the training examples. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the processed right half. For row 15, processed right half is [2,2,2,2,2,2]. So output row is [2,2,2,2,2,2].\n\nBut in Example 2's row 2, the output includes elements from both left and right. \n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed to provide the following output based on the assumption that the output is the right half with 8s replaced by the left part's elements, then taking the first half of that. For Test Input's row 15, processed right half is [2,2,2,2,2,2], first half [2,2,2], but output rows in the examples have the same length as the left part. \n\nAlternatively, the output is the processed right half. For Example 2's row 2, processed right half is [4,2,1,1,4,4,4,4], but the output row is [4,4,4,4,2,1,1,4], which is left half's first four and processed right's first four. \n\nSo, for Test Input's row 15:\n\nLeft half first 3 elements: [2,2,2]\n\nProcessed right's first 3: [2,2,2]\n\nOutput row: [2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nFor row 20:\n\nProcessed right half: [2,1,1,2,2,2]\n\nOutput row: left first 3 [2,1,8] \u2192 no, but maybe the output is processed right half. \n\nThis is too vague. Given the time constraints, I'll provide the following output for the Test Input, assuming that each row is transformed by replacing 8s with the background value (4 or 2) and then centered in a shorter row. However, this is a shot in the dark.",
