        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by analyzing each example one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input has a 4 and 2 in the middle rows. The output shows a pattern where 4s are spreading out in a diagonal or triangular shape towards the right. The original 4 and 2 are replaced with 4s, and then each subsequent row has a cluster of three 4s moving to the right. It looks like maybe the numbers are expanding in a certain direction, maybe right and up?\n\nIn Example 1: The input has two 3s and a 2. The output shows the 3s forming a diagonal line moving down and to the right. The 2 is replaced with a 3, and each row after that adds a 3 further to the right and down. So maybe the number in the input (like 3 here) is propagating diagonally downwards and to the right, increasing in length each row.\n\nExample 2: Input has 6 and 2 in the middle. The output has 6s spreading out to the left and upwards. The original 6 and 2 become 6s, and each row above has three 6s moving left. So maybe the higher number (6 vs 2) takes precedence, and propagates in a certain direction. Wait, in the input of example 2, the 6 and 2 are adjacent, but the output's 6s are spreading upwards and to the left. Hmm.\n\nExample 3: Input has 2s and a 7. The output shows 7s spreading both left and right. The output starts with 7s on the top left and then forming a sort of diamond shape. Wait, the input here is a 2 and 7 in adjacent cells. The output has a lot of 7s. So maybe when there are two different numbers, the higher one replaces the lower ones, and then spreads out in some pattern.\n\nPutting this together: The pattern seems to involve taking the highest number in a cluster and then propagating it in a certain direction, maybe creating a triangle or diagonal pattern. Let's see the details.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has a 4 and 2. Since 4 is higher, the output has 4s spreading to the right. The original position is in row 4 and 5 (0-indexed?), and the output starts creating a pattern where each row above has the 4s shifted right. Wait, in the output of example 0, the first three rows have 4s on the right side. Looking at rows 0-5 of the output, the 4s start at the 6th index (0-based) in row 0, then 5th in row1, etc. So it's like a diagonal moving leftwards as we go down the rows. But how does that relate to the input positions?\n\nWait, maybe the direction is determined by the position of the highest number. Let me check each example's input positions.\n\nIn Example0: The 4 and 2 are in columns 2 and 3 (assuming 0-based) in rows 4 and 5. The output has the 4s moving towards the right edge. So perhaps when the highest number is on the left, it propagates to the right? Or maybe the position determines the direction of spread.\n\nIn Example1: The highest number is 3, located in row 1 and 2, columns 2 and 3. The output's 3s spread down and to the right, creating a diagonal line. Each row adds one more 3 to the right and down.\n\nExample2: The highest is 6, located in row3, column3 and row4, column4. The output's 6s spread upwards and to the left. Wait, looking at the output for example2, the first row (row0) has 6s starting at index6. Then row1 has them starting at 5, etc. So each row, the starting index decreases by 1, moving left. So the direction is leftwards and upwards. The highest number 6 is in the middle rows, and propagates upwards and left.\n\nIn Example3, the input has 2 and 7. The highest is 7, located in row4, column4. The output shows 7s spreading in both left and right directions. Wait, in example3's output, the top rows have 7s on both ends. Like row0 starts with 7s on the left and right. Maybe when the highest number is in a certain position, it spreads in multiple directions.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is:\n\n1. Identify the highest number in the input grid.\n2. Determine the direction(s) in which to spread that number based on its original position.\n3. The spread creates a pattern where each subsequent row (or column) has a cluster of the highest number expanding in that direction.\n\nWait, but how exactly is the direction determined? Let's look again.\n\nIn Example0, the highest number is 4. It's located in rows 4 and 5, columns 2 and 3. The output's 4s form a diagonal moving up and to the right. The first row of the output (row0) has 4s starting at index6. Then each row below starts one position to the left. So the pattern starts from the right and moves left as we go down. Maybe the highest number's original position determines the starting point of the spread.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spread is in the direction opposite to where the original number is located. For example, if the original number is in the lower half, the spread is upwards. But how about left and right?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spread is to the right if the original is on the left side. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0, the original 4 is in column 2 (left side of the grid). The spread is to the right, starting from the right edge. Wait, in the output, the 4s are placed on the rightmost columns. So maybe it's expanding to the right, but starting from the right edge.\n\nWait, perhaps the spread is creating a right-justified triangle. For example0's output, the first row (row0) has three 4s starting at position 6 (0-based), which is the 7th element. Then row1 starts at position5, etc., so each row the 4s shift left by one. This creates a diagonal pattern moving left as you go down the rows.\n\nSimilarly, in example1's output, the 3s start at column2 in row1, then column3 in row2, etc., moving right and down.\n\nSo maybe the direction is determined by the original position. For example0, since the original 4 is in the lower middle, the spread is upward and to the right. But the output's 4s are in the upper right. Hmm, maybe the spread is towards the top-right corner.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the highest number's position determines where the triangle starts. For example, in example0, the original 4 is in row4 and 5. The output's 4s start appearing from row0 upwards. Wait, no, example0's output starts the 4s in the first rows. Wait, the input's 4 is in row4 (assuming rows are 0-based from top). So maybe the output starts spreading from the original position upwards and to the right.\n\nWait, in example0's output, the first occurrence of 4s is in row0, which is higher up than the original row4. So the spread is upwards. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the highest number in the input creates a diagonal \"wave\" that starts from the right or left edge, depending on the original position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where each row has a sequence of three of the highest number, moving one position each row. The direction could be determined by the original position. For example, if the original number is in the lower half, the sequence moves upward and to the right. If it's in the upper half, maybe it moves downward.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example2's input, the 6 is in row3 and 4. The output's 6s start at row0 and move left. So from row3 upwards (rows 0,1,2,3) and each row's cluster moves left. So the spread is upwards and leftwards.\n\nIn example3, the 7 is in row4, column4. The output's 7s spread to the left and right. The first row has 7s on the left and right ends, then the next rows have them moving inwards. Wait, example3's output is a bit more complex. The first row (row0) has 7s at the start and end. Then row1 has 7s starting at position0 and 5. Maybe the spread is in both directions. So when the highest number is in the center, it spreads in multiple directions.\n\nSo perhaps the key is:\n\n- Identify the highest number(s) in the input grid.\n- The output creates a pattern where each subsequent row (above or below) has a cluster of three of that number, shifted in a specific direction.\n- The direction depends on the original position of the highest number. For example, if the highest is on the left side, it spreads to the right. If in the middle, perhaps it spreads in multiple directions.\n\nBut how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the highest number's cells in the input form a \"seed\" and then in the output, that number propagates in a way that creates a diagonal of three of that number, moving in a direction. For example, if the input has two adjacent cells with the highest number, then in the output, each row above or below will have a cluster of three of that number, shifted left or right.\n\nWait, let's take example0: input has a 4 and 2. The highest is 4. The output shows that the 4 is replaced by 4,4,4 in the same row? Wait, looking at example0's input, row4 has [0,0,4,2,0...], and row5 has [0,0,4,4,0...]. So in the output, the highest number (4) is propagated upwards, each row having three 4s shifted to the right. So starting from the original position, each row above has the cluster shifted right by one, creating a diagonal.\n\nWait, in example0's output, the first row with 4s is row0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4]. Then row1 has [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0], which is shifted left by one. So the clusters are moving left as you go down the rows. But how does that relate to the original position?\n\nOriginal 4s are in rows4 and5. The output starts the clusters in row0, which is above. So it's like the highest number is creating a wave that starts at the top and moves down, but the clusters shift left as you go down. Hmm, maybe the direction is determined by the original position's row. If the original is in the lower rows, the clusters start at the top and move down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a mirror or rotation of the original. For example, flipping the grid vertically and then creating a pattern. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see the positions of the highest numbers in each example and where they appear in the output.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput has 4s at rows4 and5, columns2 and3.\n\nOutput starts the 4s in row0, columns6-8 (three 4s). Then each subsequent row (row1) has them starting at column5, etc. So the clusters are moving left as we go down the rows. The highest number's original position is in lower rows, and the output starts at the top and moves down while shifting left.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput has 3s at row1, columns2-3 and row2, column2.\n\nOutput starts in row1, columns2-3 (same as input), then row2 has columns2-4 (three 3s), row3 columns3-5, etc. So each row's cluster is shifted right by one column and down by one row.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput has 6 at row3, column3 and row4, column4 (since 6 and 2 are adjacent, but 6 is higher). Output starts with 6s at row0, columns6-8, then row1 columns5-7, etc. So clusters moving left as rows increase.\n\nExample3:\n\nInput has 7 at row4, column4 (since 7 is higher than 2). Output shows 7s in row0 columns0-1 and 6-8 (two clusters?), then row1 has columns0-2 and 5-7. Wait, example3's output seems more complex. Let me check again.\n\nIn example3's output:\n\nRow0: [7,7,0,0,0,0,7,7,7] \u2192 7s on the left (positions0-1) and right (6-8).\n\nRow1: [7,7,7,0,0,7,7,7,0] \u2192 7s on left (0-2) and middle (5-7).\n\nRow2: [0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0] \u2192 a block of 7s from positions1-6.\n\nRow3: [0,0,7,7,7,7,0,0,0] \u2192 positions2-5.\n\nRow4: [0,0,7,7,7,0,0,0,0] \u2192 positions2-4.\n\nRow5: [0,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 positions1-3.\n\nRow6: [7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 positions0-2.\n\nRow7: [7,7,0, ... \u2192 positions0-1.\n\nRow8: [7,0, ... \u2192 position0.\n\nSo the pattern here is that the 7s form a diamond shape, expanding from the center. But how does this relate to the input's position of 7 at row4, column4?\n\nIn the input, the 7 is at (4,4) which is the exact center of the 9x9 grid. The output seems to spread the 7s outward in all directions, creating a diamond pattern. But why are there 7s on both ends in the first few rows?\n\nThis suggests that when the highest number is at the center, it spreads in multiple directions, creating a symmetrical pattern. So perhaps the direction of spread depends on the original position of the highest number.\n\nPutting all together, the pattern could be:\n\n1. Identify the highest number in the input grid.\n2. For each cell containing the highest number, determine the direction(s) to spread based on their position.\n3. The spread involves creating a diagonal line of three of that number in each subsequent row, moving in the determined direction(s).\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe highest number here is 8, located at row3, column5 (0-based). The adjacent cell in row3, column6 is 2, which is lower.\n\nNow, according to previous examples, when the highest number is in a certain position, the spread direction is determined. Let's look at similar examples.\n\nExample1's highest number (3) was in row1 and 2, columns2-3. The spread was downward and to the right.\n\nExample2's highest (6) was in row3 and 4, columns3-4. The spread was upwards and to the left.\n\nTest input's 8 is at row3, column5. So it's on the right side of the grid.\n\nLooking at example0: highest number on the left side, spread to the right.\n\nExample2's highest in middle rows, spread upwards and left.\n\nSo maybe the direction is opposite to the position. For example, if the highest is on the right side (like column5), the spread is to the left. But also, since it's in row3 (middle row), maybe the spread is upwards.\n\nLooking at example2: highest number in row3, column3. Spread upwards and to the left.\n\nIn test input, the highest is row3, column5. So maybe the spread is upwards and to the right?\n\nBut the output for example2, which had highest in middle-left, spread upwards and left. So maybe the direction is towards the top-left or top-right.\n\nAlternatively, for the test input's 8 in column5 (right side), maybe the spread is to the left and upwards.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, since the 8 is at column5 (right side), the spread would be towards the left. Let's think about how the output would look.\n\nIf the 8 is the highest, then the output should have clusters of 8s spreading from its position. Let's imagine a pattern where each row above the original position has a cluster of three 8s shifted left by one each row.\n\nOriginal position is row3, column5. So the first cluster (row3) would have 8, but in the input, there's an 8 and a 2. But the output would replace the 2 with 8.\n\nWait, looking at example0: the input had a 4 and 2, which became 4,4,4 in the output row. Similarly, example3's input had 2 and 7, which became 7s.\n\nSo any cell adjacent to the highest number in the input may be replaced by the highest number, then the spread begins.\n\nWait, maybe the initial step is to \"grow\" the highest number into adjacent cells, then form a pattern based on that.\n\nBut the training examples' inputs have some cells with the highest number and others with lower. In the output, those lower numbers are replaced with the highest if they are adjacent.\n\nBut in example0's input, row4 has 4 and 2. The output for row4 is 4,4,4. So the 2 is replaced with 4. Similarly, row5's input has 4,4,0, which becomes 4,4,0 in the output (but in the output example0, row5 is [0,0,4,4,0,...], but the original input's row5 is [0,0,4,4,0...]. Wait, the output for example0's row5 is [0,0,4,4,0...], which is the same as input. So maybe the initial step is to replace adjacent lower numbers with the highest, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a separate pattern based on the highest number's position, not modifying the input's other cells except for replacing the lower adjacent ones.\n\nBut perhaps the main pattern is not about modifying existing cells but creating a new pattern based on the highest number's position.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the highest number \"radiating\" outwards in a certain direction. For example, in example0, the 4s form a diagonal from the top right to lower left. Each row has a cluster of three 4s, moving leftward.\n\nSo for the test input, the 8 is in row3, column5. So maybe the pattern would be clusters of 8s starting at column5 and moving left as the rows increase.\n\nFor example, row0 would have 8s starting at column (5 + (row0 - row3) * direction). Let's say direction is left per row.\n\nSo row3 (original) has 8 at column5. Then row2 would have 8s starting at column5 -1 =4. Row1 at column3, etc. Each row above would shift left by 1. But the output would show clusters of three 8s in each row, starting one position to the left each row upwards.\n\nWait, but in example0, the original is in row4 and5. The output starts clusters from row0. So maybe the direction is upwards, but the clusters start from the right and move left as you go down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the highest number creates a diagonal of clusters that start at the top right (for positions on the left) or top left (for positions on the right). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is such that the clusters move in a direction opposite to the original position. For example, if the highest number is on the right side of the grid, the clusters start at the left and move right as you go down.\n\nWait, let's try to think of the test input. The highest is 8 at row3, column5 (right side). So in the output, perhaps the 8s will form a diagonal moving to the left as we go upwards.\n\nSo for each row above row3, the cluster starts one position to the left. For example:\n\n- Row3 (original): [..., 8, 2, ...] becomes [...,8,8,8...] in some columns.\n- Then row2 would have 8s starting at column4.\n- Row1 at column3.\n- Row0 at column2.\n\nBut how many rows would this continue? Let's see in example0: the original was in rows4 and5, and the output has 4s up to row5. So the number of rows with clusters depends on the original position.\n\nAlternatively, the clusters start at the top and each row's cluster is shifted left by one as we go down.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at example2's input. The highest number 6 is at row3, column3 and row4, column4. The output's 6s start at row0, column6, and each subsequent row shifts left by one. So the pattern starts from the top and shifts left each row down.\n\nSimilarly, test input's highest is at row3, column5. So maybe the output's clusters start from row0, column (5 + (0 -3))? Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the distance from the original row to the top row is 3 (since row3 to row0 is 3 rows up). So the starting column for the cluster would be 5 +3 =8 (if moving right), but that's the last column. But in example2, the 6 is at row3, column3. The output's first row (row0) has 6s starting at column6, which is 3 columns to the right. So maybe the starting column is original column + (original row - current row). For example, row0's starting column is 3 + (3 -0) =6. Which matches example2.\n\nSo if we apply this formula to the test input:\n\nOriginal position is row3, column5. For each row r in the output, the starting column would be 5 + (3 - r). For example:\n\nRow0: 5 +3 =8 \u2192 start at column8. But a cluster of three 8s would need to start at column6 (since 8-2=6). Wait, no. If starting column is 8, the cluster would be columns6-8? But that's three elements. Wait, 8 is the start column? No, maybe the starting column is computed as original column + (original row - current row), then the cluster occupies three columns starting from there.\n\nWait, example2's original row3, column3. For row0:\n\nStarting column =3 + (3 -0) =6. So cluster starts at column6, three elements: columns6,7,8. Which matches example2's row0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6].\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the formula is:\n\nFor each row r in the output:\n\nstart_col = original_col + (original_row - r)\n\nThen, place three of the highest number starting at start_col, but if start_col + 2 exceeds the grid's width, it wraps around or is truncated. But in the examples, it seems to be allowed to go beyond, but looking at the examples, the start_col is calculated and the three elements are placed if possible.\n\nSo for the test input's original position (row3, column5), highest number 8.\n\nFor each row r from 0 to8:\n\nstart_col =5 + (3 - r).\n\nLet's compute start_col for each row:\n\nr=0: 5 +3=8 \u2192 start_col=8. So three elements would be columns8-8+2=8, but since the maximum column is8, it's just [8,8,8] starting at8? Wait, but a cluster of three would require columns6-8 if start_col is6. Wait, perhaps the start_col is the first column of the three. So if start_col is8, then the cluster is columns6,7,8? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps start_col is the middle column. But examples don't seem to support that.\n\nWait, in example0's output row0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4], the cluster starts at column6. So start_col=6, and three elements:6,7,8.\n\nIn example0's original position was row4 and5. So for example0's row0, start_col=2 (original_col=2) + (4-0)=6. Oh, wait, the original_col in example0 is2 and3? Wait, example0's input has 4 in row4, column2 and row5, column2 and3. So perhaps the start_col is based on the original_col of the highest number.\n\nWait, perhaps for each highest number cell, the start_col for each row r is computed as original_col + (original_row - r). Then, in example0's original_col is2 and3. But which one is used? Maybe the leftmost occurrence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is applied per highest number cell, and the output is a combination of all such clusters.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Let's try to apply this to example0.\n\nExample0's highest number is4, located at row4, column2 and row5, columns2 and3.\n\nFor row4, column2:\n\nstart_col for row r is2 + (4 - r).\n\nFor example, row0:2 +4=6. So cluster starts at6.\n\nRow1:2 + (4-1)=5. Cluster starts at5.\n\nRow2:2 + (4-2)=4. Cluster starts at4.\n\nRow3:2 + (4-3)=3. Cluster starts at3.\n\nRow4:2 +0=2. So cluster at2-4.\n\nBut example0's output for row4 is [0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0], which starts at2. So that matches.\n\nSimilarly, row5's original_col=2 and3.\n\nFor row5, column2:\n\nstart_col=2 + (5 - r).\n\nFor row0:2 +5=7. Cluster starts at7, but the output's row0 starts at6. So this doesn't fit. So maybe the leftmost occurrence is considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only one of the highest number cells is used. Like, the leftmost or uppermost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the highest number's position is considered as a single point, possibly the earliest occurrence (lowest row and column).\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the formula seems to hold for example0: the cluster starts at start_col= original_col + (original_row - r).\n\nFor example0, the original_col=2, original_row=4.\n\nFor row0, start_col=2 +4=6 \u2192 cluster at6-8. Which matches the output.\n\nRow1:2+3=5 \u2192 cluster at5-7. Which matches example0's row1: [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0].\n\nYes, so that formula seems to work for example0.\n\nExample2:\n\nHighest number6 is at row3, column3 and row4, column4.\n\nAssuming we take row3, column3 as the original position.\n\nFor row0, start_col=3 +3=6 \u2192 cluster at6-8. Which matches example2's output.\n\nFor row1, start_col=3 + (3-1)=5 \u2192 columns5-7. Which matches.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nExample1's highest number3 is at row1, column2. So start_col=2 + (1 - r).\n\nFor example, row1 (original row), start_col=2 + (1-1)=2 \u2192 columns2-4. Which matches example1's output row2 (since original row is1). Wait, example1's output row1 has columns2-3, but row2 has columns2-4. Hmm, maybe the formula is slightly different.\n\nWait, example1's output row1 is [0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0], but the output's row2 is [0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]. So maybe the formula for example1 is start_col=2 + (1 - r).\n\nFor row1: 2 + (1-1)=2 \u2192 columns2-4? But the output for row1 is only two 3s. Hmm, this seems conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cluster size increases as we move down. Like in example1, the original row is1. So for row1, the cluster is two 3s. For row2, three 3s, etc. But this complicates the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is start_col=original_col + (current_row - original_row). Wait, for example0:\n\noriginal_row=4, current_row=0. current_row - original_row= -4. So start_col=2 + (-4) \u2192 negative, which doesn't make sense. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, start_col = original_col + (original_row - current_row). So for example0's row0: 4-0=4 \u2192 start_col=2 +4=6. Which works. For row1:4-1=3 \u21922+3=5. Yes.\n\nExample1: original_row=1, original_col=2.\n\nFor row1: 1-1=0 \u2192 start_col=2+0=2. So cluster starts at2. Output row1 has [0,0,3,3,0...] \u2192 two 3s. But according to the formula, it would be three 3s starting at2. But this is not the case. So perhaps the cluster starts at start_col and has length equal to the number of rows from original_row to current_row.\n\nHmm, perhaps the number of elements in the cluster depends on the distance from the original row.\n\nAlternatively, the cluster is always three elements, but if start_col is such that it goes beyond the grid, it gets truncated. For example, in example1, row1's start_col=2. So three elements would be columns2-4. But in the output, only two are present. This inconsistency suggests that the formula might be different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is different. For example, the clusters are always three elements, and the direction is determined by the original position.\n\nIn example1, the original row is1. The output for row1 has two 3s (original cells), but row2 has three 3s starting at column2, row3 has three starting at3, etc. So perhaps after the original row, each subsequent row adds a cluster shifted right by one. So the clusters start at the original column and move right as we go down.\n\nBut in example0, the clusters start at higher rows (row0) and shift left as we go down. So there's a contradiction.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is different for different examples. Let's think of each example:\n\nExample0: the cluster starts at row0, column6 (right side) and moves left each row down.\n\nExample1: cluster starts at row1, column2 and moves right each row down.\n\nExample2: cluster starts at row0, column6 and moves left each row down.\n\nExample3: cluster starts at row0, columns0 (left) and 6 (right), then expands inward.\n\nSo the direction depends on the original position. For example, if the highest number is on the left, the cluster moves right; if on the right, moves left. If in the center, expands both ways.\n\nTest input's highest number is at column5 (right side), so the cluster would start at the right and move left as we go down.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nHighest number8 is at row3, column5.\n\nUsing the formula start_col = original_col + (original_row - current_row).\n\nFor row0: start_col =5 + (3 -0)=8 \u2192 cluster starts at8. So three 8s in columns6-8? Wait, no. Columns8, but the cluster of three would require columns6-8 if start_col is6. Wait, perhaps the formula start_col = original_col - (current_row - original_row). No.\n\nWait, in example0:\n\noriginal_row=4, original_col=2.\n\nstart_col for row0: 2 +4=6.\n\nSo columns6-8.\n\nIn example2:\n\noriginal_row=3, original_col=3.\n\nstart_col for row0:3+3=6.\n\nSo columns6-8.\n\nIn test input, original_row=3, original_col=5.\n\nstart_col for row0:5+3=8. So columns8-10, but since the grid only has 9 columns (0-8), it's columns6-8. Wait, no. If start_col=8, then three columns would be 8, which is impossible. So perhaps when start_col +2 exceeds the grid, it's truncated.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is start_col = original_col - (current_row - original_row).\n\nWait, that would make:\n\nFor example0, original_row=4, current_row=0:\n\nstart_col=2 - (0-4) =2+4=6. Same as before.\n\nTest input:\n\noriginal_row=3, original_col=5.\n\nFor row0:\n\nstart_col=5 - (0-3)=5+3=8. So cluster starts at8. But three elements would be 8-2=6 to8. So columns6-8.\n\nBut in example0, row0's cluster starts at6 (start_col=6), which gives columns6-8.\n\nSo for test input's row0, cluster would be columns6-8 filled with8s.\n\nRow1: start_col=5 - (1-3)=5+2=7 \u2192 columns7-9. But since the grid has only 9 columns (0-8), columns7-8. But we need three elements. So maybe it's columns5-7? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is start_col= original_col + (original_row - current_row), but ensuring that start_col doesn't exceed the grid.\n\nFor test input:\n\nRow0:\n\nstart_col=5 +3=8. So cluster starts at8. Since we need three elements, columns6-8.\n\nBut how? Because start_col=8, and three elements would require 8,9,10, which is impossible. So maybe in such cases, the cluster is truncated. But in example0, start_col=6 allows three elements (6-8). So perhaps in test input's row0, the cluster starts at6-8, even though the formula gives8. That seems conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is start_col=original_col + (original_row - current_row), and if start_col is beyond the grid, it's adjusted.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Let's proceed with the assumption that the start_col is computed as original_col + (original_row - current_row), and the cluster is three elements starting at start_col. If start_col is beyond the grid, it wraps or is truncated.\n\nFor test input:\n\nRow0:\n\nstart_col=5 +3=8. So cluster is8, but the grid has only up to column8. So the cluster would be [8,8,8] in columns6-8? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the cluster is placed such that it ends at start_col. For example, if start_col=8, the cluster is6-8. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is start_col = original_col - (original_row - current_row).\n\nFor example0:\n\nstart_col=2 - (4-0)=2-4= -2. That doesn't make sense. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction is reversed. For example, in example0, the cluster starts at6 for row0, which is original_col=2 plus (4-0)=6. So same as before.\n\nTest input's row0 would have start_col=5 +3=8. So three elements would be8-2=6. So columns6-8. So row0's output would have [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8].\n\nRow1: start_col=5 + (3-1)=5+2=7 \u2192 columns5-7? Or7-9, but truncated to7-8. So row1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8].\n\nBut according to example0, the clusters are three elements. So for row1, start_col=7, but that would require columns7-9. Since columns go up to8, it's columns7-8. But that's only two elements. This is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cluster is three elements, so if start_col is7, columns7,8, and maybe 6. But that's not following the pattern.\n\nThis suggests that my initial formula might be incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Look at the test input's highest number at row3, column5. The output should have a pattern where each row has a cluster of three8s starting at a column that decreases by1 as the row increases.\n\nSo row3: cluster starts at5.\n\nRow2: starts at6.\n\nRow1: starts at7.\n\nRow0: starts at8.\n\nRow4: starts at4.\n\nRow5: starts at3.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut example0's original row is4, and the clusters start at row0 with column6, which is6=2+4 (original_col + original_row - current_row).\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of rows the cluster appears is based on the original row. For example, if the original is in row3, the cluster appears in rows0 to6, with start_col=5 +3 -r.\n\nFor r=0:5+3=8 \u2192 columns6-8.\n\nr=1:5+2=7 \u2192 columns5-7.\n\nr=2:5+1=6 \u2192 columns4-6.\n\nr=3:5+0=5 \u2192 columns3-5.\n\nr=4:5-1=4 \u2192 columns2-4.\n\nr=5:5-2=3 \u2192 columns1-3.\n\nr=6:5-3=2 \u2192 columns0-2.\n\nr=7:5-4=1 \u2192 columns negative, so ignored.\n\nr=8:5-5=0 \u2192 columns-2, ignored.\n\nBut this would generate clusters in rows0 to6, with start_col=8,7,6,5,4,3,2.\n\nEach cluster has three elements:\n\nrow0: 6-8 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8]\n\nrow1:5-7 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0]\n\nrow2:4-6 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0]\n\nrow3:3-5 \u2192 [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nrow4:2-4 \u2192 [0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nrow5:1-3 \u2192 [0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nrow6:0-2 \u2192 [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRows7 and8 would not have clusters.\n\nThis matches example2's pattern, where the highest number was in row3, and the clusters appear up to row6.\n\nSo applying this to the test input, the output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRows7 and8: all zeros.\n\nBut looking at example3, which had the highest number in the center, the pattern was more complex with clusters on both ends. But in the test input, the highest number is not in the center (row3, column5 is more to the right), so the pattern would be similar to example2 but shifted to the right.\n\nWait, example2's highest number was in row3, column3. The output clusters started at row0, column6 (6=3+3), and moved left each row.\n\nTest input's highest number is row3, column5. So start_col=5+3=8 for row0. Then each subsequent row decreases start_col by1. So the output should look like:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRows7 and8 would be all zeros.\n\nBut wait, the test input's original position is row3, column5, which is part of the input's rows2 and3. The input's row3 has 8 and2, so the output's row3 would replace the 2 with8, resulting in [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0], which matches the pattern.\n\nYes, this seems to fit. So the final answer would have the output rows as described.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input grids and output grids, and I need to see how they're transformed. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a 4, 2 in the middle rows. The output shows a sort of diagonal spread of 4s moving to the right. Like, the 4s are expanding upwards and to the right, creating a triangle shape. The 2 might be turning into a 4? Or maybe the 4s are propagating in some way. But in the output, the 4s form a diagonal line increasing in length and then decreasing. Wait, the first row of the output has three 4s towards the end, then each subsequent row shifts them left by one, but adding on the right? Hmm, maybe it's a diagonal expansion.\n\nExample 1's input has 3,3 and 3,2. The output has a diagonal line of 3s increasing down and to the right. Like starting from the 3s in the input, they spread diagonally to the right and down, creating a staircase of 3s. The 2 might become a 3 here. So maybe when there's a number next to a different number, the higher one takes over, or maybe it's combining them? But in the output, the 2 is replaced by 3, so perhaps the higher number propagates.\n\nExample 2: Input has 6 and 2 in the middle. The output has 6s spreading in a similar diagonal pattern, but this time starting from the bottom and moving up and right. Wait, the output starts with the top row having 6s on the right, then each row shifts left and adds one more. But how does that relate to the input's 6 and 2? The 2 might be replaced by 6 here. So maybe the larger number takes over adjacent cells in a certain direction.\n\nExample 3's input has 2,2 and 2,7. The output has 7s spreading in a pattern that's a bit more complex. The output has 7s forming like a diamond or something. The 7s are spreading both upwards and downwards. Wait, in the output, the top left has some 7s, and then they spread diagonally to the right and down. Maybe the 7 in the input is the dominant number, and it's expanding in multiple directions. Also, the 2s in the input are replaced by 7s. So perhaps when two different numbers are adjacent, the higher one propagates, replacing the lower ones and expanding outward.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern seems to involve taking the highest number from the input cells (like in a cluster where different numbers are adjacent) and then creating a diagonal expansion of that number upwards and to the right, or in some direction. Let's see how each example's highest number is positioned.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 4 and 2. The highest is 4. The output's 4s form a diagonal from the bottom left towards the top right. Wait, no. Looking at Example 0's output: the first row has 4s starting from the 6th position. Then each next row starts one position earlier. So maybe the 4 is moving upwards and to the right, creating a right-leaning diagonal. But how does the original position affect this?\n\nLooking at the input for Example 0: the 4,2 is in row 4 (0-based index 4) and columns 2 and 3. In the output, the 4s start spreading upwards and to the right. The first row of the output (row 0) has 4s starting at position 6. So it's shifted to the right. Maybe the direction is based on the position of the highest number. Or maybe the expansion is to the right and upwards.\n\nAnother observation: the number of 4s in each row of the output increases until a certain point and then decreases. Like in Example 0, the first few rows have increasing numbers of 4s, then they start decreasing. For instance, the first output row has three 4s, the next three 4s shifted left, then three again. Wait, no. Let me check again:\n\nExample 0's output rows:\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4] \u2192 three 4s starting at index 6.\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0] \u2192 three 4s starting at 5.\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0] \u2192 starting at 4.\nRow 3: [0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0] \u2192 starting at 3.\nRow 4: [0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0] \u2192 starting at 2.\nRow 5: [0,0,4,4,0,...] \u2192 two 4s here.\n\nSo each row, starting from row 0 down to row 4, the 4s start moving left, then in row 5, it's shorter. So the expansion is upwards and to the left? Wait, the origin is in row 4 (input) at column 2 and 3. In the output, the 4s spread upwards (rows 0-4) and to the right (columns 6-8 in row 0). Hmm, maybe it's propagating diagonally up and to the right. Because each subsequent row (from row 0 to row 4) the starting column of the 4s moves left by one, which is the same as moving up one row and left one column. Wait, but row 0 is the top row. So if the origin is in row 4, then row 0 is four rows above. So each step up a row shifts the starting column left by one? That might be the case.\n\nIn Example 1, the highest number is 3. The input has 3s in row 1 and 2. The output shows the 3s spreading diagonally down and to the right. For example, row 1 has 3s starting at column 2, row 2 starts at column 2 and extends, then row 3 starts at column 3, etc. So maybe it's a different direction. Wait, in Example 1's output, the 3s start at row 1, column 2. Then in row 2, they have 3s starting at column 2 again but with an extra 3 to the right. Then in row 3, starting at column 3, etc. Wait, maybe the direction is down and to the right. So each row below the origin shifts the start to the right.\n\nBut how does this relate to the position of the original numbers? The input in Example 1 has 3s in rows 1 and 2. The output starts spreading from row 1, column 2, and then each subsequent row shifts the 3s to the right. So perhaps the direction depends on the location of the highest number. In Example 0, the highest number was in the middle rows, and spread upwards and to the right. In Example 1, maybe it's spreading downwards and to the right. Wait, the output in Example 1 starts from row 1 and goes down, each row adding a new 3 to the right. So row 1 has two 3s, row 2 has three, row 3 three, etc. Wait, no. Let me check Example 1's output:\n\nExample 1's output:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,3,3,0,...] \u2192 two 3s.\nRow 2: [0,0,3,3,3,0...] \u2192 three 3s.\nRow 3: [0,0,0,3,3,3...] \u2192 three 3s starting at column 3.\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,3,3,3...] \u2192 starting at column 4.\nAnd so on, until row 8 has a single 3 at column 8.\n\nSo the pattern here is that starting from the original 3s (row 1 and 2, columns 2-3), the 3s spread diagonally down and to the right. Each subsequent row's 3s start one column to the right and extend three columns. But wait, in row 2, the 3s are columns 2-4. Then row 3 is columns 3-5, etc. So it's a diagonal line moving down-right. So for each row, the starting column increases by 1 as the row number increases.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 6 and 2. The highest is 6. The output's 6s start from the top right and move diagonally down-left. Let's look:\n\nRow 0: 6s at columns 6-8.\nRow 1: columns 5-7.\nRow 2: columns 4-6.\nRow 3: columns 3-5.\nRow 4: columns 2-4.\nRow 5: columns 1-3.\nRow 6: columns 0-2.\nRow 7: columns 0-1.\nRow 8: column 0.\n\nSo the 6s form a diagonal from the top right (row 0, column 6) to the bottom left (row 8, column 0). So the direction is down and to the left. But how does this relate to the input's position? The input's 6 is in row 3, column 3 and row 4, column 3 (since the input rows are [0,0,0,6,2,0...] in row 3 and [0,0,0,2,6,0...] in row 4. Wait, the 6 is at row 3 column 3 and row 4 column 4. So the highest numbers are at (3,3) and (4,4). Then in the output, the 6s start spreading upwards and to the right? But in the output, the 6s start at the top right. Hmm, maybe the direction is determined by the position. If the origin is in the lower part of the grid, the expansion is upwards and to the right. But in Example 0, the origin is in rows 4 and 5, and the expansion is upwards and to the right, resulting in the 4s moving up to the top rows but shifted to the right.\n\nWait, maybe the direction is always to the right, but the starting point is determined by the original position. For example, in Example 0, the 4s are in rows 4 and 5. The output's 4s start at row 0 (top) column 6 and move left as we go down. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the transformation is taking the cluster of numbers in the input, replacing all with the maximum number, then creating a diagonal expansion in a certain direction.\n\nAnother angle: in each input, there's a small cluster of numbers (like two adjacent cells with numbers). The output replaces those with the maximum value of the cluster and then expands that maximum in a diagonal pattern. The direction of the diagonal depends on the original cluster's position. For example, if the cluster is in the lower half, the expansion is upwards and to the right. If it's in the upper half, maybe it's downwards. Or maybe it's based on the orientation of the cluster.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input: there's a cluster of 2,2 and 2,7. The maximum is 7. The output shows 7s spreading both upwards and to the right and downwards. The output has 7s in the top left (row 0, columns 0-1 and 6-8), which is a bit more complex. Maybe the expansion is in multiple directions. For instance, the 7 in the input is at row 4, column 4. The output has 7s spreading up-left, up-right, and down-left? It's a bit hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the maximum number in the input is expanded in a diamond shape, but adjusted based on the position. For example, in Example 3, the output has 7s forming a diamond-like pattern. The first few rows have 7s on the left and right, then merging in the middle. But I'm not sure. This example is more complex.\n\nWait, the input in Example 3 is:\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,2,2,0...]\nRow 4: [0,0,0,2,7,0...]\n\nSo the maximum is 7 at (4,4). The output's first row (row 0) has 7s on the left (columns 0-1) and right (6-8). Then row 1 has 7s starting at column 0-2 (left) and 5-7 (right), but with a 7 in the middle. Maybe the 7 is expanding in multiple directions: upwards left and upwards right. So from (4,4), it's expanding up-left and up-right, creating a V shape. Then each subsequent row up continues expanding those arms. But in row 0, the left arm reaches columns 0-1 and the right reaches 6-8. Then row 1 has the left arm at columns 0-2 and the right at 5-7. Wait, but that would form an X shape. Then, as rows go down, the arms come together. Maybe it's expanding in two directions: up-left and up-right. That might explain the pattern in Example 3.\n\nSo the general pattern could be: find the maximum number in the input grid. Replace all occurrences in the input with that maximum. Then, from each cell containing the maximum, expand diagonally in certain directions (like up-left, up-right, etc.), creating a pattern that depends on the original positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expansion is along the diagonals where the original cells are located. For example, in Example 0, the original 4s are in columns 2 and 3 of rows 4 and 5. The output's 4s form a diagonal starting from the top right, moving left each row. So maybe the expansion is along the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). But how does the starting point relate to the original cells?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by taking the original cells and shifting them diagonally upwards and to the right, replicating the value and spreading it. For each non-zero cell in the input, in the output, it's moved to the right by a certain number of columns equal to the row difference from the original. For example, in Example 0, the original cells are in row 4 and 5. If we shift each cell to the right by (original_row - current_row) * some factor, but this is vague.\n\nAnother approach: look for how the output's non-zero elements relate to the input's. In Example 0, the input has non-zero in rows 4 and 5. The output's non-zero starts from row 0 and goes down to row 5, each row having a block of 4s that shift left as the row increases. So maybe the input's non-zero rows are projected upwards, and the columns shifted to the right. Like, the original row 4's 4 is moved up to row 0 and shifted right by 4 columns (original column 2 \u2192 column 6). Then row 1 shifts it right by 3 columns (column 5), etc. So each step up a row, shift right by (original_row - new_row). For example, row 0 is 4 rows up from original row 4. So 4-0=4, so shift right by 4 columns. 2 + 4 =6. That's where the 4s start in row 0. Then in row 1, shift right by 3 (4-1=3): 2+3=5. Which matches the starting column of 5 in row 1. Similarly, row 2: 4-2=2 \u2192 2+2=4. Which matches. So the pattern for Example 0 seems to be that each original cell's value is moved up N rows and shifted right by N columns, where N is the number of rows moved up. Then, the value is spread in a block of three cells (like 3 consecutive cells) in each row.\n\nBut in Example 0, the input row 4, column 2 (4,2) and row 5, column 2 and 3 (5,2 and 5,3). So maybe each original cell is contributing to a diagonal line in the output. For example, cell (4,2) \u2192 in row 0, it's shifted to column 2 + (4-0) =6. Then in row 1, column 2 + (4-1)=5. And so on. Then, for each such shifted cell, the output has three consecutive cells with the maximum value. So each original cell generates a diagonal of three cells in the output, starting at (original_row - N, original_column + N) for N from 0 to some limit.\n\nBut in Example 0, there are two original cells contributing. The cell at (4,2) would generate a diagonal starting at row 4-0=4, column 2+0=2. Then row 3, column 3, etc. But the output starts at row 0. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the shift is based on the original row's distance from the top. For example, if the original row is 4 (0-based), then moving up 4 rows to row 0, shifting right by 4 columns. That would place the 4s starting at column 2+4=6 in row 0. Then each subsequent row (row 1) would shift right by 3 (4-1), so column 2+3=5. So for each original cell, the starting column in row (original_row - N) would be original_column + N. Then, for each N from 0 up to original_row, you place three consecutive 4s starting at column original_column + N. But how does this fit with the outputs?\n\nIn Example 0, the output starts in row 0 with three 4s starting at column 6. Original cell is (4,2). original_row - N =0 \u2192 N=4. So original_column +4=2+4=6. Then for N=3, row=1, column 2+3=5. So three 4s starting at 5. And so on. But for each N from 0 to 4 (since original_row=4), so rows 0-4. Then in row 5, which is original_row +1, but there's also the cell from row 5, column 2 and 3. For example, original cell (5,3): shifting up to row 0 would be N=5, but row 0 is original_row - N =5-5=0. Column 3 +5=8. So in row 0, column 8 would be part of the 4s. But in Example 0's output, row 0 has columns 6-8 as 4s. So perhaps this cell (5,3) contributes to that. So each original cell is creating a diagonal line of three 4s in the output, starting at (original_row - N, original_column +N) for N from 0 up to original_row.\n\nSo, for cell (4,2):\n\nN=0 \u2192 row4-0=4, column2+0=2 \u2192 row4, column2-4: but in output, row4 starts at column2, but it's 4,4,4,0. So maybe three 4s starting at column2.\n\nN=1 \u2192 row3, column3 \u2192 row3, columns3-5: yes, in the output, row3 has 4s starting at column3.\n\nSimilarly, cell (5,2):\n\nN=0 \u2192 row5, column2: but in the input, row5 is [0,0,4,4,0...]. So perhaps in the output, row5 has 4,4,0... which matches.\n\nN=1 \u2192 row4, column3: which is part of row4's 4s.\n\nThis seems to check out. So each original cell generates a diagonal line upwards and to the right, with three consecutive cells in each row, as long as it's within bounds.\n\nIn Example 1, the original cells are in rows1 and2, columns2-3. The maximum is3. The output's 3s start at row1, column2, then each subsequent row shifts right by1. For each original cell, the diagonal would be row - N, column + N. For example, cell (1,2):\n\nN=0 \u2192 row1, column2 \u2192 part of row1's 3s.\n\nN=1 \u2192 row0, column3. But in the output, row0 has no 3s. Hmm. Wait, Example1's output starts from row1, so maybe the expansion is downwards. Wait, the output has 3s spreading from row1 down to row8. So for cell (1,2):\n\nN=0 \u2192 row1, column2 \u2192 included.\n\nN=1 \u2192 row1+1, column2+1 = row2, column3 \u2192 which is part of the output row2.\n\nWait, maybe the expansion is downwards and to the right. For each original cell, the expansion is N steps down and right, creating three cells per row. For example, original cell (1,2):\n\nFor N=0 \u2192 row1, column2-4 (but how?). Alternatively, if each cell generates a diagonal that goes down and right, starting from the original cell. So for cell (1,2):\n\nRow1: columns2-3 (original 3s)\n\nRow2: columns3-5 (adding two 3s to the right)\n\nBut in the output, row2 has 3s in columns2-4. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example1's output, each row after the original starts with 3s shifted right by (row - original_row). For example, original rows1 and2. Let's take cell (1,2):\n\nIf we consider moving down from row1, the shift would be (current_row - original_row). So for row2, shift=1 \u2192 column2+1=3. But row2's 3s start at column2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the maximum number in the input creates a diagonal line that starts from the original cell and extends in a certain direction. For example, in Example0, the original cells are in rows4 and5. The output's diagonal starts from row0, column6, which is up4 rows and right4 columns from row4, column2. So the direction is up and right. For each row above the original, the column increases by (original_row - current_row).\n\nIn Example1, the original cells are in rows1 and2. The output's diagonal starts in row1, column2 and moves down and right. For example, row1 starts at column2, row2 starts at column2 (but extends further?), then row3 starts at column3. So the direction is down and right. So for each row below the original, the starting column increases by (current_row - original_row). For example, original row1, column2:\n\ncurrent_row = original_row + N \u2192 column = original_column + N.\n\nSo for N=0 (row1), column2.\n\nN=1 (row2), column3.\n\nN=2 (row3), column4.\n\nBut in the output, row2's 3s start at column2. Hmm, this doesn't align. So maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nLet's think differently. Maybe the output is a mirrored or rotated version of the input's non-zero elements. For Example0, the input's non-zero elements are in the lower-middle part. The output's non-zero elements are in the upper-right part, arranged diagonally. So perhaps the output is a reflection or rotation of the input's pattern. For example, flipping vertically and horizontally, then expanding. But Example0's input is two rows with 4s in columns2-3. Flipping vertically would put them in rows3 and4 (since the grid has 9 rows). Flipping horizontally would put them in columns6-7. Then expanding each row to have three 4s. But this is speculative.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output's non-zero elements form a diagonal band. The direction of the diagonal varies. The number of elements per row increases then decreases, but the exact pattern depends on the example.\n\nPerhaps the transformation involves taking the input's non-zero cells, determining their maximum value, and then creating a diagonal wave spreading from those cells in a particular direction. For example, the direction is determined by the relative positions of the non-zero cells. In Example0, the cells are in consecutive rows (4 and5), same columns (2 and3). The output's diagonal is moving upwards and to the right, creating a right-leaning diagonal. In Example1, the cells are in two consecutive rows (1 and2), same columns (2 and3). The output's diagonal moves downwards and to the right. Example2's cells are in rows3 and4, columns3 and4. The output's diagonal starts from the top right and moves left and down. Example3's cells are in rows3 and4, columns3-4. The output's diagonal has two arms moving up-left and up-right.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: for each example, identify the maximum value in the input. Then, in the output, that maximum value is arranged in a diagonal pattern. The direction and starting point of the diagonal depend on the position of the maximum in the input.\n\nFor Example0, the maximum is4 in rows4 and5, columns2-3. The output's diagonal starts at row0, column6 (which is top right) and moves down-left.\n\nFor Example2, the maximum is6 in rows3 and4, columns3 and4. The output's diagonal starts at row0, column6 (same as Example0) and moves down-left, but in this case, the starting point is higher up.\n\nWait, in Example2's output, the first row (row0) has 6s starting at column6. So perhaps the starting column for the diagonal is determined by the column of the maximum plus the row distance from the top. For example, the maximum in Example0 is at row4. The starting column is 2 (original column) + (9-4-1) =2 +4=6. Wait, 9 rows total, so row index 0-8. So row4 is the fifth row. The starting column might be original column + (8 - row) \u2192 8 is the last row index. So for row4, 8-4=4 \u2192 2+4=6. That matches Example0's starting column6. For Example2's original cell (3,3), 8-3=5 \u21923+5=8. But the output starts at column6. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the starting column is original column + (original row). For Example0: 2 +4=6. Example2's original cell (3,3):3+3=6. That matches. So the starting column is original_column + original_row. Then, each subsequent row in the output shifts the starting column left by 1. So for Example0's output, row0 starts at 6, row1 at5, etc.\n\nThat makes sense. So the formula for the starting column in the output's row0 is original_column + original_row. Then, each row below shifts left by 1. But how many rows does this pattern continue?\n\nIn Example0, the original rows are4 and5. For row4, column2: starting column in row0 is2+4=6. Then the pattern continues for (original_row +1) rows. So for row4, 4+1=5 rows (rows0-4) have 3 4s starting at6,5,4,3,2. Then row5 has 2 4s starting at1? No, in the output, row5 starts at0,0,4,4,0. Wait, maybe the number of rows in the output's diagonal is original_row +1. For Example0, original_row4: 5 rows, which matches the output's rows0-4. Then, the remaining rows (5-8) have fewer 4s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal continues until it reaches the bottom of the grid. For Example0, starting at row0, column6, each row shifts left by1. So row0:6, row1:5, row2:4, etc. until row6:0. But in Example0's output, the diagonal stops at row5, which starts at column0. Hmm, but Example0's output has rows0-5 with 4s.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows in the diagonal is the original_row +1. For Example0, original_row4:5 rows (rows0-4). Then, any remaining rows (like row5) are handled differently. But in Example0's output, row5 is [0,0,4,4,0...], which is the original row5's cells.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Let's try to formalize the pattern based on examples:\n\nFor each input:\n\n1. Find all non-zero cells.\n2. Determine the maximum value among them.\n3. For each cell with this maximum value:\n   a. Create a diagonal line in the output starting at (original_row - original_row, original_column + original_row) = (0, original_column + original_row).\n   b. For each row i in 0 to (original_row), the starting column is (original_column + original_row) - i.\n   c. Fill three consecutive cells with the maximum value starting at that column.\n4. If there are multiple cells with the maximum, their diagonals may overlap or combine.\n\nFor Example0, the cell at (4,2) (row4, column2) would generate a diagonal starting at row0, column2+4=6. Then for each row i from0 to4, starting column is6-i. So row0:6, row1:5, row2:4, row3:3, row4:2. Each of these rows has three 4s starting at that column. That matches Example0's output rows0-4. Then, the cell at (5,3) would generate a diagonal starting at row0, column3+5=8. So row0:8, row1:7, row2:6, row3:5, row4:4, row5:3. For row0, columns6-8 are already filled by the first diagonal, and the second diagonal would start at8, but the row0 has three 4s from6-8, so perhaps they overlap. But in Example0's output, row0 has 4s at6-8, which is where the second diagonal's row0 would start (column8). But that's only one cell. So maybe overlapping is handled by combining.\n\nBut this seems to fit. For Example0:\n\n- Cell (4,2) creates a diagonal from row0 column6, moving left each row.\n- Cell (5,3) creates a diagonal from row0 column8, moving left each row.\nBut how do these combine? In the output, rows0 has 4s from6-8, which could be the combination of both diagonals. Then row1 has 4s from5-7 (from first diagonal) and7-9 (but column9 is out of bounds). So perhaps only up to column8. So row1's 4s are5-7. Then row2:4-6. Etc.\n\nBut in the output, each row's 4s are three consecutive cells. So for Example0's row0:6-8 (3 cells), row1:5-7 (3), row2:4-6 (3), etc. This matches the pattern of each diagonal contributing three cells, but overlapping. But in reality, the output doesn't have overlapping cells beyond the three, so perhaps each diagonal's contribution is three cells, and overlapping is handled by merging.\n\nNow, for the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,8,2,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n... (rest are zeros)\n\nThe non-zero cells are in row2, columns5-6 (2s) and row3, columns5 (8) and6 (2). So the maximum value is8.\n\nFollowing the pattern, we need to create a diagonal for each cell with value8. In the test input, there's only one cell with8: row3, column5.\n\nSo applying the pattern:\n\nFor cell (3,5):\n\noriginal_row=3, original_column=5.\n\nThe starting column in row0 would be5+3=8. Then each row i from0 to3 will have three 8s starting at column8 -i.\n\nSo row0: start at8 \u2192 columns8-10, but since there are only9 columns (0-8), it's columns8-8 (only one cell). But according to previous examples, they fill three cells if possible, even if they go out of bounds. But looking at Example2's output, the top row has 6,6,6 at columns6-8, which is three cells. So for row0, the starting column is8, but three cells would require columns8,9,10, which are out of bounds. But in Example0, the cell at (5,3) would start at8, but row0 only has up to column8. So in that case, perhaps only one cell is filled. But Example0's output has three cells starting at6 in row0. So perhaps the starting column is calculated, but if the starting column plus 2 (three cells) exceeds the grid's width, it's truncated.\n\nWait, in the test input's case, the starting column for row0 is8. So three cells would be columns8,9,10. Since the grid only has columns0-8, only column8 is valid. So row0 would have [...,8]. But looking at the examples, like Example2's output row0 has three 6s at6-8. So when the starting column is6, three cells are6,7,8. Which is valid. So when the starting column is8, three cells would be8,9,10. But since 9 and10 are invalid, only column8 is filled. But according to Example3's output, for example, in row8, there's a single7 in column0. So perhaps even if three cells can't be filled, they fill as many as possible.\n\nSo for the test input's cell (3,5):\n\nStarting at row0, column5+3=8.\n\nRow0: columns8-8 (only one 8).\n\nRow1: starting column8-1=7. So columns7-9. Valid columns7-8: two 8s.\n\nRow2: starting column8-2=6. Columns6-8: three 8s.\n\nRow3: starting column8-3=5. Columns5-7: three 8s.\n\nRows4-8: starting column8-4=4 (row4), but original_row is3, so we only generate up to row3. Wait, according to the pattern, for a cell in row3, the diagonal starts at row0 and goes up to row3. So for cell (3,5), the diagonal would be in rows0,1,2,3.\n\nRow0: column8 \u2192 [8] but in the output, it's three cells. So maybe we still fill three cells, but truncated. So row0 would have one 8 in column8.\n\nRow1: starting at7 \u2192 three cells would be7-9, but 9 is invalid. So columns7-8: two 8s.\n\nRow2: starting at6 \u2192 three cells6-8.\n\nRow3: starting at5 \u2192 three cells5-7.\n\nBut in the test input, the output should reflect this.\n\nBut wait, the other non-zero cells in the input are 2s. Since the maximum is8, those 2s would be replaced with8 in the output. But according to the training examples, lower numbers are replaced by the maximum. So in Example0, the 2 was replaced with4. In Example3, the 2s were replaced with7.\n\nSo in the test input, all non-zero cells become8. But wait, no. Because in Example3, the input had 2s and a7. The output replaced all with7. So yes, the maximum is taken, and all non-zero cells are replaced with the maximum. Then, the maximum's cells generate the diagonal expansions.\n\nSo the test input's non-zero cells are:\n\nRow2: columns5-6 \u2192 2,2.\n\nRow3: columns5-6 \u21928,2.\n\nThe maximum is8. So all non-zero cells are turned into8. So the input's non-zero cells after replacement would be:\n\nRow2:5-6 \u21928,8.\n\nRow3:5\u21928, 6\u21928.\n\nBut according to the pattern, each of these8 cells would generate their own diagonals.\n\nSo cell (2,5) \u2192 original_row=2, original_column=5. Starting column in row0:5+2=7. So diagonal starts at row0, column7. Then rows0,1,2 (since original_row=2). So:\n\nRow0: column7 \u2192 three cells7-9. Only7-8 are valid. So two 8s.\n\nRow1: column7-1=6 \u2192 three cells6-8.\n\nRow2: column7-2=5 \u2192 three cells5-7.\n\nSimilarly, cell (2,6): original_row=2, original_column=6. Starting column=6+2=8. So diagonal starts at row0, column8.\n\nRow0:8 \u2192 one cell.\n\nRow1:8-1=7 \u2192 three cells7-9 \u2192 two valid.\n\nRow2:8-2=6 \u2192 three cells6-8.\n\nCell (3,5): original_row=3, original_column=5. Starting column=5+3=8.\n\nRow0:8 \u2192 one cell.\n\nRow1:8-1=7 \u2192 three cells7-9 \u2192 two.\n\nRow2:8-2=6 \u2192 three cells6-8.\n\nRow3:8-3=5 \u2192 three cells5-7.\n\nCell (3,6): original_row=3, original_column=6. Starting column=6+3=9 \u2192 invalid. So diagonal starts at column9, which is out of bounds, so no contribution.\n\nWait, but columns are 0-8. So starting column9 is invalid. So this cell (3,6) would generate a diagonal starting at row0, column9, which is invalid. So no contribution.\n\nSo combining all these cells' contributions:\n\nRow0: columns7 (from cell2,5), column8 (from cell2,6,3,5).\n\nBut row0's output would have 8s starting at7 and8. But since each diagonal contributes three cells, perhaps overlapping.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Let's think about how the training examples would handle multiple cells.\n\nIn Example0, two cells (4,2 and5,3) contribute to the diagonal. Their diagonals overlap in row0, columns6-8 (from4,2's starting column6 and5,3's starting column8). But in the output, they merge into a single block of three 4s.\n\nSimilarly, in the test input, each of the four cells (2,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6) after replacement to8 would generate diagonals. But (3,6) may not contribute.\n\nLet's list the contributions:\n\nCell (2,5): row0, column7 \u2192 three cells7-9 (columns7-8). So in row0: columns7-8.\n\nRow1:6-8.\n\nRow2:5-7.\n\nRow3:4-6 (but original_row=2, so only up to row2.\n\nCell (2,6): row0, column8 \u2192 columns8-10 (only8).\n\nRow1:7-9 (7-8).\n\nRow2:6-8.\n\nRow3:5-7 (original_row=2, so stops at row2.\n\nCell (3,5): row0, column8 \u2192 columns8-10 (8).\n\nRow1:7-9 (7-8).\n\nRow2:6-8.\n\nRow3:5-7.\n\nRow4:4-6 (original_row=3, so up to row3.\n\nCell (3,6): no contribution.\n\nNow, combining all these:\n\nRow0:\n\nFrom cell (2,5):7-8.\n\nFrom cell (2,6):8.\n\nFrom cell (3,5):8.\n\nSo row0:7,8,8 (but overlapping). But according to the pattern, each cell's contribution is three cells. So for row0, cell (2,5) adds 7-9 \u21927-8, cell (2,6) adds8-10 \u21928, cell (3,5) adds8-10 \u21928. So merged together, row0 would have columns7-8 as 8s, but the maximum allowed is three cells. Hmm, this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell's contribution is three cells, but overlapping ones are merged. For row0:\n\n- cell (2,5):7,8,9 (but 9 is invalid \u21927,8)\n- cell (2,6):8,9,10 \u21928\n- cell (3,5):8,9,10 \u21928\n\nSo merged, row0 has7,8,8. But in Example0, when two cells contributed to the same row, the output merged them into a single block. For example, cell (4,2) and (5,3) contributed to row0, columns6-8. So the merged result is three 4s. So perhaps overlapping contributions are merged into a continuous block.\n\nIn row0 of the test input, the merged contributions would be from columns7-8. But to make three cells, perhaps they are padded. But in the previous examples, when the starting column was such that three cells couldn't be filled, they filled as many as possible. For example, in Example2's row8: [6,0,...], which is one cell. So perhaps in the test input's row0, columns7-8 are filled, but since it's less than three, but according to the examples, even if three can't be filled, they are filled as much as possible. But looking at the examples:\n\nIn Example2's output, row6 has three 6s (columns0-2). But row7 has two 6s (columns0-1), and row8 has one 6 (column0). So when the starting column plus 2 exceeds the grid, they truncate. So the pattern is to fill three cells if possible, otherwise as many as possible.\n\nSo for the test input's row0, starting column7 (from cell2,5) would have 7-9 \u21927-8 (two cells). Starting column8 (from cell2,6 and3,5) would have8-10 \u2192 one cell. So merged, row0's 8s are in columns7-8 and8. So columns7-8 are filled. So two cells. But in Example3's output, row0 has two 7s on the left and three on the right. So maybe multiple contributions can overlap and create longer sequences.\n\nBut this is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to determine for the test input that the maximum is8, located at row3, column5. Then, the diagonal starts at row0, column5+3=8. Then each subsequent row shifts left by1, filling three cells where possible.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nRow0: ... 8,8,8 (columns6-8) but according to the calculation, starting column8 can only have one cell. Hmm, conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the diagonal starts at row0, column (original_row + original_column) =3+5=8. Then each row i, the starting column is8 -i. For i from0 to3 (original_row3):\n\nRow0:8 \u21928,9,10 (but only8 exists).\n\nRow1:7 \u21927,8,9 (7-8).\n\nRow2:6 \u21926-8.\n\nRow3:5 \u21925-7.\n\nSo row0: [ ..., 8]\n\nRow1: [ ...,7,8,8]\n\nRow2: [...,6,8,8,8]\n\nRow3: [...,5,8,8,0]\n\nBut this doesn't match the examples. For example, Example0's row0 starts at6, which is4+2=6, and each row shifts left by1. So for the test input, perhaps the diagonal starts at row0, column8, and each row below shifts left by1, filling three cells:\n\nRow0:8 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8] (assuming three cells but only one possible).\n\nWait, no. Let's look at Example2's input, which had maximum6 at row3, column3 and row4, column4. The output's diagonal starts at row0, column6 (3+3=6) and row0, column7 (4+4=8). Then each row shifts left by1. So the first cell's diagonal starts at6 and the second at8. Merged, they form a diagonal from6 to0.\n\nSo for the test input, the maximum is8 at row3, column5. So starting column8. Then each row below shifts left by1:\n\nRow0:8 \u2192 three cells:8 (only one)\n\nRow1:7 \u2192 three cells7-9 (two cells)\n\nRow2:6 \u21926-8 (three cells)\n\nRow3:5 \u21925-7 (three cells)\n\nRow4:4 \u21924-6 (three cells, but original_row is3, so no contribution beyond row3.\n\nBut according to the pattern in Example0, the diagonal includes rows up to original_row. So rows0-3.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8] \u2192 but three cells would be8, but only one column. So maybe just one8.\n\nBut according to Example2's output, even if the starting column is6, they have three cells. So perhaps the rule is to always write three cells, even if they go out of bounds, but truncate.\n\nBut in the test case's row0, starting column8 would have three cells:8,9,10. But only column8 exists. So row0's output is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8].\n\nBut looking at Example3's output, row8 has a single7. So perhaps it's allowed.\n\nThen row1: starting column7, three cells7-9. Columns7-8 are filled.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8].\n\nRow2: starting column6, three cells6-8.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0].\n\nRow3: starting column5, three cells5-7.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0].\n\nBut original_row is3, so row4 and beyond are not part of the diagonal.\n\nBut wait, the cell at row3, column5 is part of the input, so the diagonal for this cell should extend for original_row +1 rows. Original_row3: 3+1=4 rows. So rows0-3.\n\nRow0:8.\n\nRow1:7.\n\nRow2:6.\n\nRow3:5.\n\nEach with three cells.\n\nSo row3 would have 5-7 filled.\n\nBut the test input's original cells after replacement are:\n\nRow2,5:8.\n\nRow2,6:8.\n\nRow3,5:8.\n\nRow3,6:8.\n\nSo each of these four cells contributes their own diagonal.\n\nSo for cell (2,5):\n\noriginal_row2, column5.\n\nStarting column2+5=7.\n\nRows0-2:\n\nRow0:7 \u21927-9 \u21927-8.\n\nRow1:6 \u21926-8.\n\nRow2:5 \u21925-7.\n\nFor cell (2,6):\n\noriginal_row2, column6.\n\nStarting column2+6=8.\n\nRows0-2:\n\nRow0:8 \u21928-10 \u21928.\n\nRow1:7 \u21927-9 \u21927-8.\n\nRow2:6 \u21926-8.\n\nFor cell (3,5):\n\noriginal_row3, column5.\n\nStarting column3+5=8.\n\nRows0-3:\n\nRow0:8 \u21928.\n\nRow1:7 \u21927-8.\n\nRow2:6 \u21926-8.\n\nRow3:5 \u21925-7.\n\nFor cell (3,6):\n\noriginal_row3, column6.\n\nStarting column3+6=9 \u2192invalid.\n\nNo contribution.\n\nSo combining all these contributions:\n\nRow0:\n\n- cell (2,5):7-8.\n\n- cell (2,6):8.\n\n- cell (3,5):8.\n\nSo merged, columns7-8.\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8].\n\nRow1:\n\n- cell (2,5):6-8.\n\n- cell (2,6):7-8.\n\n- cell (3,5):7-8.\n\nMerged, columns6-8.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8].\n\nRow2:\n\n- cell (2,5):5-7.\n\n- cell (2,6):6-8.\n\n- cell (3,5):6-8.\n\nMerged, columns5-8.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8]. But each contribution is three cells. So perhaps it's [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0].\n\nWait, cell (2,5)'s contribution is5-7.\n\nCell (2,6) contributes6-8.\n\nCell (3,5) contributes6-8.\n\nSo merged, columns5-8. But each contribution is three cells, so columns5-7 from cell (2,5), 6-8 from others. So merged, columns5-8. But since each cell contributes three, the merged result would have columns5-8 filled. But the grid's length is9 columns (0-8). So row2 would have columns5-8 filled. That's four cells. But in the examples, the output always has three cells per row. This suggests that overlapping contributions can result in longer sequences.\n\nBut looking at Example3's output, row0 has 7s in columns0-1 and6-8. So merged, two separate blocks. But perhaps when multiple diagonals contribute, they form different blocks.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. The test input's output likely will have the maximum value8 spreading in a diagonal pattern similar to the examples. Given the test input's maximum cell at (3,5), the diagonal would start at row0, column8 and shift left each row. So the output would look like:\n\nRow0: 8s starting at column8.\n\nRow1:7.\n\nRow2:6.\n\nRow3:5.\n\nEach with three cells if possible.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n...\n\nBut considering other cells:\n\nRow2,5 and row2,6 also contribute. Their diagonals would start at7 and8, leading to more 8s in earlier rows.\n\nBut given time constraints, I'll proceed with the pattern where each cell's diagonal starts at original_row + original_column, and shifts left each row, filling three cells where possible. The test input's output would then have 8s forming a diagonal from column8 in row0 down to column5 in row3, with each row having three 8s where possible.\n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\nAnd the rest of the rows are zeros. But according to the examples, the pattern continues until the original_row. So rows4 and below would have 8s if possible.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the pattern continues beyond the original_row. The original_row was4, but the output's 4s go down to row5. So perhaps the diagonal continues until it can't anymore.\n\nBut in the test input's case, the cell at row3, column5's diagonal would start at row0, column8, and for each row down, shift left. So rows0-8:\n\nRow0:8 \u2192 8.\n\nRow1:7 \u21927-9 \u21927-8.\n\nRow2:6 \u21926-8.\n\nRow3:5 \u21925-7.\n\nRow4:4 \u21924-6.\n\nRow5:3 \u21923-5.\n\nRow6:2 \u21922-4.\n\nRow7:1 \u21921-3.\n\nRow8:0 \u21920-2.\n\nBut since the original_row is3, perhaps the contributions stop at row3. But in Example0, the cell at row5 contributed to row5's output.\n\nSo perhaps each cell contributes to (original_row + original_column) rows. Or perhaps the diagonal continues until the bottom of the grid.\n\nIn Example0, the cell at row5, column3 contributes to rows0-5. Because 5+3=8, but that's the starting column. The rows would be from row0 down to row5.\n\nSo for the test input's cell (3,5):\n\nStarting column8, so for each row from0 to8 (total9 rows), the starting column is8 - (current_row). So:\n\nRow0:8-0=8.\n\nRow1:8-1=7.\n\nRow2:8-2=6.\n\nRow3:8-3=5.\n\nRow4:8-4=4.\n\nRow5:8-5=3.\n\nRow6:8-6=2.\n\nRow7:8-7=1.\n\nRow8:8-8=0.\n\nEach of these rows would have three 8s starting at the calculated column. But truncating if out of bounds.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow0:8 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8] (three cells, but only one possible).\n\nRow1:7 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8].\n\nRow2:6 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0].\n\nRow3:5 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0].\n\nRow4:4 \u2192 [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0].\n\nRow5:3 \u2192 [0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow6:2 \u2192 [0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow7:1 \u2192 [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow8:0 \u2192 [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut considering other cells:\n\nCell (2,5) contributes:\n\nStarting column7 (2+5=7).\n\nRows0-2:\n\nRow0:7 \u21927-9 \u21927-8.\n\nRow1:6 \u21926-8.\n\nRow2:5 \u21925-7.\n\nCell (2,6) contributes:\n\nStarting column8 (2+6=8).\n\nRows0-2:\n\nRow0:8 \u21928.\n\nRow1:7 \u21927-9 \u21927-8.\n\nRow2:6 \u21926-8.\n\nCell (3,5) contributes:\n\nStarting column8 (3+5=8).\n\nRows0-3:\n\nRow0:8.\n\nRow1:7.\n\nRow2:6.\n\nRow3:5.\n\nCell (3,6): no contribution.\n\nCombining all contributions:\n\nRow0:7-8 (from cell2,5), 8 (from cell2,6), 8 (from cell3,5).\n\nResult:7-8, and 8 \u21927-8. So row0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8].\n\nRow1:6-8 (cell2,5),7-8 (cell2,6),7-8 (cell3,5).\n\nResult:6-8. So [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8].\n\nRow2:5-7 (cell2,5),6-8 (cell2,6),6-8 (cell3,5).\n\nResult:5-8. So [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8]. But since each contribution is three cells, maybe it's5-7 and6-8 merged \u21925-8. But according to the examples, each row has three cells. Example0's row5 has two 4s. So perhaps merged contributions can form longer sequences.\n\nBut the main pattern is to have each cell's diagonal contribute three cells per row, merging where they overlap.\n\nGiven all this, the final output for the test input would likely have the 8s forming a diagonal starting from the top-right and moving left each row, with three cells per row. So the answer is similar to Example2's output but with8s.",
