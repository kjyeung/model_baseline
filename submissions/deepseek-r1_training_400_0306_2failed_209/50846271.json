        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input lists are being transformed into output lists where some elements are changed to 8. Let's see when that happens.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input and output for the sixth row (index 5) in Example 0 is:\n\nInput: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHmm, so the 5 at position 10 (0-based index 10) became 8. Then positions 12, 13, 14 also turned to 8. Looking at the original numbers, those were 5s. But what's special about them? Let's check the surrounding elements. The element before index 10 is 2 at index 9. Then the next elements are 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 2. So maybe whenever a 5 is immediately following a 2, it becomes 8? But in this case, the 5 at index 10 is after a 2 at index 9, and the next 5s at 12-14 are after a 2 at index 11? Wait, index 11 is 2, then 12 is 5. Wait, but in the output, index 12 is 8. So perhaps when a 5 comes after a 2, it's turned into 8. But that might not explain all cases.\n\nLooking at Example 1. Take the third row:\n\nInput: [0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5]\nOutput: [0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 8, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5]\n\nHere, the 5 at index 6 becomes 8. The element before it is 0 at index 5, so that doesn't fit the previous idea. Wait, maybe there's another pattern. Let's check the next example.\n\nIn Example 2's input row 5:\n\nInput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 2, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5]\nOutput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 2, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5]\n\nWait, in this case, the output didn't change. Wait no, looking back, the output for example 2's row 4 is:\n\nInput: [5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\nOutput: [5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n\nSo the 5 at index 11 becomes 8. The previous element is 5 (index 10) and next is 5 (index 12). Hmm, not sure. Let's check another example where 8 appears.\n\nIn Example 3's input row 4:\n\nInput: [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0]\nOutput: [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nSo the 5 at index 7 becomes 8. The element before it is 2 (index 6), and after is 2 (index 8). So maybe when a 5 is between two 2s? But wait, in the first example, the 5 at index 10 is after a 2 (index 9) but before a 2 (index 11). Wait, the input there was 5,2,5,2, etc. So in the output, the 5s between 2s are turned into 8s.\n\nWait in Example 0's input row 5 (the sixth row), the input is:\n\n5, 2, 5, 2, 5,5,5,2,5,...\n\nThe output is 8,2,8,8,8,2,5... So the 5 after a 2 becomes 8, but only if the next element is also a 2? Or maybe the 5s that are between 2s? Let me see:\n\nLooking at the positions where 8 appears in the outputs:\n\nIn Example 0's row 5:\n\nOriginal positions 10: 5 becomes 8. Next element is 2. Then position 12:5 becomes 8, previous is 2 (position 11) and next is 5 (position 13). Hmm, maybe not. Wait the input here is:\n\n[...,5,2,5,2,5,5,5,2,5...]\n\nThe output becomes [...,5,2,8,2,8,8,8,2,5...]\n\nSo the 5s that are after a 2 and before another 2? Let's see:\n\nPosition 10: 5 is after 2 (position 9) and before 2 (position 11). So yes, between two 2s? But in that case, the 5 at position 10 is between 2 and 2. Then the next 5 at position 12: original is 5 at position 12 (input) is between 2 (position 11) and 5 (position 13). So that doesn't fit. But in the output, the 5 becomes 8. So maybe the rule is that any 5 that comes after a 2 is turned into 8, regardless of what's next.\n\nWait in example 3's row 4: the 5 is at position 7, which comes after a 2 (position 6) and before a 2 (position 8). So it's between two 2s. So that would explain the 8. But in Example 0's row 5, the 5 at position 12 is after 2 (position 11) but before 5 (position 13). So perhaps the rule is that a 5 following a 2 is turned into 8, regardless of what comes next. Let's check another example.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 2:\n\nInput: [0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5]\nOutput: [0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 8, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5]\n\nHere, the 5 at index 6 becomes 8. The element before is 0 (index 5), so that doesn't fit the previous idea. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at the surrounding elements, perhaps the 5 is part of a group where it's between a 2 and another number. Or maybe it's the position in the list. Alternatively, maybe the 8 is replacing 5s that are in even positions? Let me check the indices where 8 appears.\n\nIn Example 0's output row 5, the 8s are at positions 10, 12,13,14. Let's see:\n\nPosition 10 is even (if starting from 0). 10 is even? 0 is even, 1 is odd, so 10 is even. Position 12 is even. So maybe even positions. But in Example 1's row 2, the 8 is at position 6 (even), which fits. Example 3's row 4: position 7 is odd. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are followed by a 2 are turned into 8. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's row 5, the 5 at position 10 is followed by 2 (position 11). So that's a 5 followed by a 2. The output is 8. Then position 12: original is 5 followed by 5 (position 13). But in the output, position 12 becomes 8. So that doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe the 5 is part of a sequence where a 2 is somewhere before it. Like, after a 2, any 5s are turned into 8s until the next non-5 element. For example, in Example 0's row 5, after the 2 at position 9, there's a 5, then a 2, then 5s. So perhaps whenever a 2 is encountered, the next consecutive 5s are turned into 8s until another non-5 is found.\n\nLet me check that. In Example 0's row 5 input: [...,5,2,5,2,5,5,5,2,5...]\n\nAfter the first 2 (position 9), next is 5 (pos 10) \u2192 8. Then pos 11 is 2. So after that 2, next 5s (pos 12,13,14) are turned into 8. Then pos 15 is 2, so after that, the next 5 (pos 16) is not turned into 8. Wait, but in the output, pos 16 remains 5. Hmm. So maybe each 2 triggers the next consecutive 5s to become 8s until another 2 is found. So between two 2s, any 5s are turned into 8s.\n\nSo for example, in the input sequence ...,2,5,5,5,2..., those 5s become 8s. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's row5: the input has 2 at pos9, then 5, then 2 at pos11. So the 5 at pos10 is between two 2s (pos9 and pos11), so it becomes 8. Then between pos11 (2) and pos15 (2), the 5s at pos12-14 are turned into 8s. That would explain why those are 8s.\n\nIn Example3's row4 input: [5,0,0,5,5,5,2,5,2,2,2,0]\n\nSo between the 2 at pos6 and the 2 at pos8: the 5 at pos7 is turned into 8. The next 2s (pos8,9,10) don't affect anything as there are no 5s in between.\n\nIn Example1's row2 input: [0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5]\n\nThe output has 8 at pos6. Let's check the input. The input at pos6 is 5. Looking for surrounding 2s. There are no 2s in this row's input. So that contradicts the previous idea. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe another pattern.\n\nWait in Example1's input row2, the output's 8 is at pos6. Let me look at the input row again. The input row is:\n\n[0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5]\n\nThe output changes the 5 at position6 to 8. So what's special about that 5? Let's see the surrounding elements. The elements are:\n\npos5:0, pos6:5, pos7:5. The previous element is 0, and the next is 5. No 2s involved. So maybe there's another rule here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8 is replacing 5s that are part of a group of three or more consecutive 5s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0 row5: the input has 5,5,5,5,5 at positions12-16. But in the output, positions12-14 become 8, but position15 is 2, so maybe only part of the group. Wait, perhaps not.\n\nIn Example1's row2, the 5 at pos6 is part of 5,5 (pos6 and7). Only two 5s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe looking for 5s that are after a 0? For example, in Example0 row5, the 5 at pos10 is after 2 (not 0). In Example1 row2, the 5 at pos6 is after a 0 at pos5. So maybe when a 5 comes after a 0, it's turned into 8. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0 row5, after 0: the 5 at pos10 comes after a 2, not a 0, so that doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the position of the element in the entire list. Like, every 5 that is at an even index (0-based) is turned into 8. Let's check Example0 row5's 8s. The positions are 10 (even), 12 (even),13 (odd),14 (even). So that's not consistent.\n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output for each example. Let's list all the positions where 5 becomes 8 and see what's common.\n\nIn Example0 row5:\n\nOriginal: [0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,2,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,2,8,2,8,8,8,2,5,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nChanged positions: 10,12,13,14. The 5s here are between 2s. So between 2s, the 5s are turned into 8s.\n\nIn Example1 row2:\n\nInput: [0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5]\n\nOutput: [0,5,0,5,5,0,8,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5]\n\nPosition6 becomes 8. The input here at position6 is 5. Looking at surrounding elements: previous is 0 (pos5), next is 5 (pos7). There's a 5 before that (pos4 and 3:5 and 5). But no 2s around. So why is this 5 turned into 8? Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example1's row5:\n\nInput: [5,5,0,0,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [5,5,0,0,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nNo change here. But in the same example's row3:\n\nInput: [5,0,0,5,5,0,2,5,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nOutput: same as input except no changes. Wait, no. Wait in Example1's output, row3 is same as input. The first change is in row2.\n\nWait, maybe there's another pattern. Let's check the positions where 8 appears and see if they are part of certain sequences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s that are adjacent to a 2 (either before or after) are turned into 8s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0 row5, position10:5 is after 2 (pos9) and before 2 (pos11) \u2192 becomes 8.\n\nPosition12:5 is after 2 (pos11) \u2192 becomes 8.\n\nSimilarly, position13 and 14 are after 5s (from previous 8). But why are they 8s?\n\nIn Example1 row2, the 5 at pos6 is preceded by 0 and followed by 5. No 2 nearby. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait maybe the 5s that are immediately followed by a 2 are turned into 8s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0 row5, position10's 5 is followed by 2 \u2192 becomes 8. Position12's 5 is followed by 5 \u2192 but in the output it's 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are followed by a 2 or preceded by a 2 are turned into 8s. But in that case, in Example0 row5, position10 is preceded by 2 and followed by 2 \u2192 8. Position12 is preceded by 2 (pos11) \u2192 8. Position13 is preceded by 5 (pos12) \u2192 but output is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's look at another example. Take Example2's row5 input:\n\nInput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 2, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5]\n\nOutput: same as input. So no change. But in row7 of Example2:\n\nInput: [0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nOutput: [0,8,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,8,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nThe 5 at position1 becomes 8. The elements around are 0 (pos0) and 0 (pos2). No 2s. So that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the 8s are replacing 5s that are surrounded by 0s. Like, a 5 that has a 0 on both sides. For example, in Example2's row7:\n\nInput at position1:5. Previous is 0 (pos0), next is 0 (pos2). So 5 becomes 8. That fits. Let's check other instances.\n\nExample0 row5, position10:5. Previous is 2 (pos9), next is 2 (pos11). So not 0s. So that's not.\n\nExample1 row2's 5 at pos6: previous is 0 (pos5), next is 5 (pos7). So only one 0. Not surrounded by 0s. But the 5 is changed to 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the 8s replace 5s that are in positions where the sum of adjacent elements is 2. For example, if a 5 is between two 1s (but 1s aren't in the examples). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 5s that are part of certain runs. Like, when a 5 is followed by a 2, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are replacing 5s that are at the same position where there's a 2 in the same position in the previous or next row. But that seems complicated, and looking at the examples, it's not clear.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that each 5 in the input is replaced by 8 if the same position in the next row (or previous) has a 2. But that would require looking at multiple rows. Let's check Example0's row5. The output changes positions 10,12,13,14. Let's see if those positions have a 2 in another row. For example, in row5 of Example0's input, position10 is 5, and in the next row (row6) position10 is 5 (no 2). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a cumulative count. For instance, every third 5 is replaced by 8. But that's hard to track across different examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking for 5s that are part of a certain pattern in the list. For example, after a 2, the next 5s until another 2 are replaced by 8. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0's row5 input:\n\nThe sequence is ...5,2,5,2,5,5,5,2,5...\n\nSo between the first 2 (position9) and next 2 (position11), the 5 at position10 is replaced by 8. Then between position11's 2 and position15's 2, the 5s at positions12-14 are replaced by 8. So any 5 between two 2s is turned into 8.\n\nIn Example3's row4 input:\n\n...2,5,2... \u2192 the 5 between two 2s becomes 8.\n\nIn Example1's row2, the 5 at position6 is between 0 and 5. So no 2s. But it's changed to 8. So that contradicts the pattern. Unless there's a 2 elsewhere in the same row. Wait, in Example1's row2 input, there are no 2s. So why is that 5 changed to 8?\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe there's another approach. Let's look for all the instances where 5 becomes 8 and see what's common.\n\nExample0 row5:\n\nPositions 10,12,13,14: 5\u21928. These are in the sequence 5,2,5,2,5,5,5,2. The 5s between the 2s are changed.\n\nExample1 row2:\n\nPosition6:5\u21928. The row has no 2s, so no idea.\n\nExample1 row5:\n\nNo changes. Example1 row3 has 2 but no 8s. Example1 row4 has 2s and 8s. For instance, row4 input:\n\n[0,5,0,5,2,5,2,2,2,0,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutput becomes [0,5,0,5,2,8,2,2,2,0,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0]. So the 5 at position5 (original) is between 2 (position4) and 5 (position6). But in the input, position5 is 5. The output turns it into 8. The next element is 2 (position6). So between 2 and 2? No, the sequence is 2,5,2. So the 5 between two 2s is turned into 8.\n\nAh, so perhaps the rule is: any 5 that is immediately preceded by a 2 and followed by a 2 is replaced by 8. But in Example0's row5, the 5 at position10 is between 2 (pos9) and 2 (pos11) \u2192 becomes 8. The 5 at position12 is between 2 (pos11) and 5 (pos13). So that doesn't fit, but in the output, position12 is 8. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait, perhaps any 5 that is either preceded by a 2 or followed by a 2 is turned into 8. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0 row5:\n\n- pos10: preceded by 2 (pos9), followed by 2 (pos11) \u2192 8.\n\n- pos12: preceded by 2 (pos11), followed by 5 \u2192 8.\n\n- pos13: preceded by 5 (pos12), followed by 5 \u2192 8.\n\nBut why are pos13 and 14 8s? They are not near 2s.\n\nAlternatively, once a 2 is encountered, all subsequent 5s are turned into 8 until another 2 is found. So between two 2s, all 5s are 8s.\n\nIn Example0 row5:\n\nAfter the first 2 at pos9, the next elements are 5,2,5,5,5,2. So between pos9's 2 and pos11's 2, there's a 5 (pos10) \u2192 8. Then between pos11's 2 and pos15's 2, the 5s at pos12-14 are 8s. Then after pos15's 2, the next 5 remains 5. That fits.\n\nIn Example1 row4:\n\nInput: ...2,5,2,2,2... The 5 between two 2s becomes 8.\n\nIn Example1 row2, there's no 2s, so why is there an 8? That's the problem. So that contradicts this rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a 2 occurs, the next 5 after it (regardless of how many) is turned into 8, but only the first one. But in Example0 row5, multiple 5s are turned into 8 after a 2.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are replacing 5s that are part of a palindrome sequence. But that seems unlikely.\n\nLet me think of another angle. Looking at all the examples, the only changes are 5\u21928. So the transformation is replacing certain 5s with 8s. So the key is to determine which 5s are being replaced.\n\nLet me take a closer look at Example1's row2:\n\nInput: [0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5]\n\nOutput: [0,5,0,5,5,0,8,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5]\n\nThe changed element is at index6. Let's see the surrounding elements:\n\nIndices5:0, 6:5,7:5.\n\nIs there a 2 in any of the adjacent rows or columns? Not sure. Maybe vertical alignment. For example, looking at the structure of the input lists, maybe the 5 is changed based on the elements in the same position in other rows. But that seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the same position as a 2 in any of the previous rows. But that's hard to track.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are replacing 5s that are in the middle of three 5s. For example, a 5 that is surrounded by two 5s. In Example0 row5, the 5s at positions12-14 are part of a sequence of three 5s. The middle one (pos13) is turned into 8. But that's not the case for pos12 and14, which are also turned into 8s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 5s in a row. For example, if there are more than three 5s in a row, replace some with 8s. But Example0 row5 has multiple 5s replaced, but other rows have more 5s not replaced.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let me try to find another approach. Maybe the 8s are part of a mathematical relationship. For example, 2+5=7, but 8 is not related. Or maybe 5 is replaced by 8 when certain conditions are met.\n\nWait, looking at the examples again, the 8s seem to appear in the vicinity of 2s. For example:\n\nIn Example0 row5: 2s and 8s are interleaved.\n\nIn Example1 row4: 2s and 8s.\n\nIn Example2 row7: the 8s are where there's a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut then in Example1 row2, there's an 8 without any 2s in the row. So maybe it's not row-based.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing 5s that are in the same position as a 2 in any of the rows. For example, if any row has a 2 in position X, then in other rows, any 5 in position X is turned into 8. But checking this would require looking at all rows, which seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are formed when a 5 is followed by a 2 and then a 5 again. Like, the sequence 5-2-5 becomes 5-2-8. But in Example0 row5, the sequence is 5-2-5-2, which becomes 5-2-8-2. Then the next 5s are between 2 and another 2. So maybe the 8s are placed between 2s.\n\nAlternatively, every time a 5 appears after a 2, it's replaced by 8. So after a 2, the next element if it's 5 becomes 8. Let's check:\n\nExample0 row5: after 2 at pos9 is 5 \u2192 8. Then after 2 at pos11 is 5 \u2192 8. Then after 2 at pos15 is 5 \u2192 remains 5. Wait, but in the output, pos12-14 are 8s. So maybe after a 2, all consecutive 5s are turned into 8s until another non-5 is encountered.\n\nLet's see:\n\nIn Example0 row5: after 2 at pos9, there's 5 (pos10) \u2192 8. Then pos11 is 2 \u2192 after that, 5 (pos12) \u2192 8, and pos13 and 14 are 5s \u2192 8. So after each 2, all subsequent 5s are turned into 8s until another 2 is found. Wait, but in pos12, after the 2 at pos11, the next 5s are turned into 8s until the next 2 at pos15. So between pos11 and pos15, all 5s become 8s.\n\nIn Example3 row4: after 2 at pos6, the next element is 5 (pos7) \u2192 8. Then pos8 is 2, so that stops the replacement.\n\nIn Example1 row4: the input is [0,5,0,5,2,5,2,2,2,0,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [0,5,0,5,2,8,2,2,2,0,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nHere, after the 2 at pos4, the next element is 5 \u2192 8. Then pos6 is 2, so stops.\n\nIn Example1 row2: the 5 at pos6 is changed to 8. But there's no 2 in that row. So that contradicts the pattern.\n\nUnless there's a 2 in another row in the same position. Let's check Example1's rows. Example1's input has multiple rows, so maybe vertical patterns.\n\nIn Example1's row2: the 5 at pos6. Let's see what's in the same column (pos6) in other rows. For example, row0: pos6 is 0. Row1: pos6 is 5. Row3: pos6 is 2. So maybe in row3, pos6 is 2. So in row2, pos6's 5 is changed to 8 because in another row (row3) the same position is 2.\n\nThat's possible. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's row5: pos10 is 5. Looking at other rows in Example0, does any row have a 2 in position10? Looking at the input rows:\n\nRow5's pos10 is 5. Other rows: row4's pos10 is 0. Row6's pos10 is 5. Row3's pos10 is 0. Row2's pos10 is 5. Row1's pos10 is 5. Row0's pos10 is 5. So no 2 in column10. But the output changes row5's pos10 to 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is done within each individual row, not across rows. So each row is processed independently.\n\nBack to Example1's row2: the 5 at pos6 becomes 8. The row has no 2s, so why?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that in any row, the first occurrence of a 5 after a 0 is replaced with 8. Let's check:\n\nIn Example1's row2: the 5 at pos6 comes after a 0 at pos5 \u2192 becomes 8.\n\nIn Example0's row5: the 5 at pos10 comes after a 2 (pos9), not a 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nIn Example3's row4: the 5 at pos7 comes after a 2 (pos6), not a 0. So no.\n\nSo that's not the pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 8s are replacing 5s that are part of a group of three or more consecutive 5s. Let's check:\n\nExample0 row5 has 5,5,5,5,5 (positions12-16). The output turns positions12-14 into 8s. So the first three of the five consecutive 5s are replaced with 8s. But why not all?\n\nExample1 row2 has two consecutive 5s (pos6 and7), only the first is replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look at all the examples again.\n\nIn Example2's row4:\n\nInput: [5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nOutput: [5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,5,8,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nThe 5 at pos11 is replaced. The input at pos11 is 5. The elements around are 5 (pos10) and 5 (pos12). So three 5s in a row. The middle one becomes 8.\n\nBut in Example0 row5's sequence of 5s, multiple are changed, not just the middle.\n\nHmm, maybe when there are three or more 5s in a row, the middle ones are replaced with 8. For example:\n\nIn a sequence of 3 5s: 5,5,5 \u2192 5,8,5.\n\nBut in Example0 row5, the sequence is 5,5,5,5. The output is 8,8,8,5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, any 5 that is between two 5s is replaced. But in Example0 row5's sequence, the first 5 (pos12) is between 2 and 5. No.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the 8s are replacing 5s that are part of a \"cross\" pattern in the grid of inputs. But since each example is a list of lists, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing 5s that have a certain number of neighbors (in the same list) that are 2s. But again, without knowing the structure (like rows and columns), it's hard.\n\nWait, in the first training example (Example0), the output's fifth row (index5) is the only one with 8s. Looking at that row's input, it's the only one with 2s. So maybe 8s are introduced when a row contains 2s. But Example1's row2 has no 2s but still has an 8. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are the sum of neighboring elements. For example, if a 5 has neighboring elements that sum to 3, it becomes 8. But this would require checking adjacent elements. For example, in Example1's row2 pos6: neighbors are 0 and 5. Sum is 5. Not 3.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the previous and next element. For Example0 row5 pos10: previous is 2, next is 2. Sum is 4. 5 becomes 8 (4+5=9? No). Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 8s are replacing 5s that are immediately after a 2. So whenever a 2 is followed by a 5, the 5 becomes 8.\n\nIn Example0 row5: 2 followed by 5 \u2192 8. Then 2 followed by 5 \u2192 8. Then another 2 followed by 5 \u2192 8.\n\nIn Example1 row4: 2 followed by 5 \u2192 8.\n\nIn Example3 row4: 2 followed by 5 \u2192 8.\n\nIn Example2's row5: no 2 followed by 5. But in Example2's row7:\n\nInput: [0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nOutput: [0,8,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,8,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nThe 5 at position1 is preceded by 0 and followed by 0. So why 8 here? There's no 2 in the row. But maybe in another row, the same position has a 2. Looking at Example2's other rows:\n\nIn row4's input: pos11 is 5. Output row4 pos11 becomes 8. Is there a 2 in the same position in another row? Let's see, row5's input pos11 is 2. So maybe if a column has a 2 in any row, the 5s in that column are replaced with 8.\n\nIn Example2 row4's pos11: in row5's input, pos11 is 2. So the 5 in row4's pos11 becomes 8.\n\nIn Example2's row7, pos1 becomes 8. Looking if any other row in Example2 has a 2 in pos1. For example, row5's pos1 is 0. row6's pos1 is0. row3's pos1 is5. So no. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at all the examples, the common thread is that 5s are changed to 8s when they are adjacent to 2s. But there are exceptions like Example1's row2.\n\nWait, maybe the 8 is replacing a 5 that is part of a sequence where a 2 is present somewhere in the same list. For example, if a row contains a 2, then all 5s in that row are replaced with 8s. But in Example0's row5, which contains 2s, not all 5s are replaced. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, in rows that contain a 2, every 5 after the first 2 is replaced with 8. For example, in Example0's row5, the first 2 is at pos9. All 5s after that are replaced until the end of the row. But in that row, there are 5s after that which are replaced, but also 5s that are not.\n\nAlternatively, every 5 that comes after a 2 in the same row is replaced with 8. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0 row5: after the first 2 at pos9, all subsequent 5s are replaced with 8s until the end. But after pos9, there's a 5 at pos10 \u21928, then pos12-14\u21928. But there's a 2 at pos11 and pos15, so maybe the replacement is between the 2s. Not sure.\n\nIn Example1 row4: after the first 2, the next 5 is replaced.\n\nIn Example1 row2: no 2s, so no replacement. But there's a replacement. So this can't be.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that whenever a 2 appears in a list, the next occurrence of 5 after it is replaced with 8. Then, if another 2 is found, the next 5 is replaced, and so on.\n\nIn Example0 row5: multiple 2s, each causing the next 5 to be replaced.\n\nIn Example1 row2: no 2s, so why is there an 8?\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to see the difference between the input and output for the test cases. The test input has several rows. Let's take the fifth row of the test input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nAccording to the pattern, any 5 that is after a 2 should become 8. The 2 is at position6. So the next element is 5 (position7) \u2192 becomes 8. Then, there's another 5 at position8 \u2192 becomes 8? Or is it only the first 5 after the 2?\n\nWait in Example0 row5, after a 2, all consecutive 5s until the next 2 are replaced. So between two 2s, all 5s become 8s.\n\nIn the test input's fifth row: [0,0,0,5,0,5,2,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nThe 2 is at position6. The next elements are 5,5,5,0,5,... So between the 2 at 6 and the next non-5 (0 at position10), the 5s at positions7,8,9 are replaced with 8s.\n\nSo the output for this row would be: [0,0,0,5,0,5,2,8,8,8,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nSimilarly, in the fourth row of the test input:\n\n[0, 5, 0, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0]\n\nThe 2s are at positions4,5,7,8. So between each pair of 2s, the 5s are replaced.\n\nBetween 2 at 4 and 2 at5: no elements in between.\n\nBetween 2 at5 and 2 at7: the element at6 is 5 \u2192 becomes 8.\n\nBetween 2 at7 and 2 at8: no elements.\n\nBetween 2 at8 and next non-2: no 2s after that.\n\nSo the output would have 8 at position6 and perhaps other places.\n\nBut I'm not sure. This seems plausible. So the rule is: between any two 2s in a row, replace all 5s with 8s. Or, whenever a 2 is followed by a 5, replace the 5 with 8, and continue replacing until another 2 is found.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nLooking at the test input rows:\n\nRow4: [0,5,0,5,2,2,5,2,2,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nThe 2s are at positions4,5,7,8.\n\nBetween 2 at5 and 2 at7: elements at6 is 5 \u2192 becomes 8.\n\nBetween 2 at7 and 2 at8: no elements.\n\nBetween 2 at8 and next 2 (none), the 5 at9 would become 8.\n\nSo the output row4 would have 5s at positions6 and9 replaced with 8.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,5,0,5,2,2,8,2,2,8,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nSimilarly, row5: [0,0,0,5,0,5,2,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nThe 2 is at position6. The 5s at7,8,9 are between 2 and 0. So they become 8s.\n\nSo output: [0,0,0,5,0,5,2,8,8,8,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nRow6: [5,5,0,0,5,5,2,0,5,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nThe 2 is at position6. Following 2 is 0, so no 5s after it. So no changes.\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,5,2,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nThe 2 is at position13. The 5 at position14 is after the 2. So becomes 8.\n\nRow12: [5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,5]\n\nNo 2s in this row, so no changes.\n\nRow14: [5,5,0,5,5,2,2,2,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nThe 2s are at positions5,6,7. Between them, 5s would become 8s. So after each 2, the 5s until the next 2 are replaced.\n\nBetween 2 at5 and 2 at6: no elements.\n\nBetween 2 at6 and 2 at7: no elements.\n\nAfter 2 at7: next element is 5 (pos8) \u2192 replaced with 8. Then 5 (pos9) \u2192 replaced until next non-2.\n\nSo output row14 becomes:\n\n[5,5,0,5,5,2,2,2,8,8,8,0,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nRow15: [5,0,0,0,5,2,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5]\n\nThe 2 is at position5. Next elements are 5 at6 \u2192 replaced with 8. Then 0, so stop. So row15 becomes:\n\n[5,0,0,0,5,2,8,0,5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5]\n\nRow16: [5,5,5,0,0,2,0,5,5,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,5,0,5,0,5,5]\n\nThe 2 at position5. Next elements are 0 (no change), then 5 at7. Between 2 at5 and next 2 at position11. So the 5 at7 and any 5s between 2 at5 and 2 at11 become 8s.\n\nPositions6:0, 7:5, 8:5, 9:0, 10:0, 11:2. So 5s at7 and8 are between 2 at5 and 2 at11. So they become 8s.\n\nAdditionally, after 2 at11, there are multiple 2s and then a 5 at16. But since they are followed by 2s, the 5 at16 is not between 2s. So row16's output would be:\n\n[5,5,5,0,0,2,0,8,8,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,5,0,5,0,5,5]\n\nFinally, applying this pattern to all test rows where 5s are between 2s, the outputs would have 8s replacing those 5s.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have these training examples where each input is a list of numbers, and the output is another list where some of the numbers have been changed. The task is to figure out the pattern in these transformations and apply it to the test input.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the training examples to see what's changing. Let's start with Example 0. The input and output are mostly the same, but some elements are replaced with 8. For instance, in the fifth input row of Example 0, the original input has [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], and the output changes some of those 5s to 8s. Specifically, the 5 at index 10 becomes 8, and the following 5s at indices 12, 13, 14 become 8 as well. Wait, let me check again. The input is:\n\n[0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe output becomes:\n\n[0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo positions 10, 12, 13, 14 are changed from 5 to 8. Hmm. Looking at the surrounding elements, maybe there's a pattern related to the presence of a 2 nearby. Let me check if this is consistent across other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1, in the third input row:\n\nInput: [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 2, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n\nOutput: [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 2, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n\nNo changes here. Wait, but in the same example's fifth input row:\n\nInput: [0, 5, 0, 5, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 5, 0, 5, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere, the 5 at index 5 is replaced with 8. The element before it is a 2 (at index 4), and after it are 2s. So maybe when a 5 is adjacent to a 2, it becomes 8? Let's check another instance.\n\nIn Example 0's sixth input row:\n\nInput: [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]\n\nOutput: [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]\n\nNo changes here. Wait, the 5 next to the 2 (index 12 is 2, then index 13 is 5) remains 5. Hmm, that's conflicting. But in the fifth row, the 5s following the 2 were turned into 8s. Maybe the direction matters. Let me look at more examples.\n\nIn Example 2's input row 6:\n\nInput: [5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0]\n\nOutput: [5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 2, 2, 8, 2, 2, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0]\n\nHere, the 5 at index 11 is replaced with 8. The elements before it are 2,2 and after it is 2. So maybe if a 5 is between 2s, it becomes 8? But in Example 0's fifth row, the 5s after a 2 are changed. Wait, maybe it's when a 5 is either preceded or followed by a 2, but not both? Or perhaps when there's a 2 in the vicinity. Alternatively, maybe the 5 is part of a sequence that includes 2s.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the positions where 8 appears. In Example 0, the fifth row's output has 8s starting at index 10. The input there had 5,2,5,2,5,5,5,2. The output becomes 5,2,8,2,8,8,8,2. So the 5s that are between 2s or adjacent to 2s are replaced with 8s. Wait, in that sequence:\n\nOriginal: [5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 2]\n\nOutput: [5, 2, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nSo the first 5 is after a 2, then comes 2, then 5 becomes 8. Then the next 5s are all between 2s? No, the next 5s are after a 2 and before another 2. Let me see: the positions are 10:5, 11:2, 12:5, 13:2, 14:5, 15:5, 16:5, 17:2. Wait, no, maybe I need to check the exact indices. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal input (Example 0's fifth input):\n\nIndices 10:5, 11:2, 12:5, 13:2, 14:5, 15:5, 16:5, 17:2.\n\nWait, no, maybe the input is:\n\nLooking back: The input is [0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,2,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nSo positions 10:5 (index 10), 11:2, 12:5, 13:5, 14:5, 15:2, etc. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let's list them properly.\n\nWait, the input array for the fifth row in Example 0's INPUT is:\n\n[0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo indexes 0-21. Let's break down the relevant part:\n\nIndices 8:5, 9:2, 10:5, 11:2, 12:5, 13:5, 14:5, 15:2, etc.\n\nSo in the output, the elements at 10,12,13,14 are changed to 8. So index 10 is 5 in input, becomes 8. It's between 2 (index 9) and 2 (index 11). Then indices 12,13,14 are 5s in input, and become 8. Those are after index 11 (which is 2) and before index 15 (2). So the 5s between two 2s (indices 9 and 11, then between 11 and 15) are turned into 8s?\n\nWait, index 10 is between 9 (2) and 11 (2). Then 12,13,14 are between 11 (2) and 15 (2). So maybe any 5 that is between two 2s, or adjacent to a 2, is turned into 8. But how does that work in other examples?\n\nLooking at Example 3's fourth input row:\n\nInput: [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nOutput: [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nHere, the 5 at index 7 is changed to 8. It's between a 2 (index 6) and a 2 (index 8). So that fits the pattern.\n\nAnother example: Example 2's seventh input row:\n\nInput: [0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5]\n\nOutput: [0, 8, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 8, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5]\n\nWait, the first element changed is index 1 (5 to 8). Let's check the surrounding elements. The original input here is [0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]. So the 5 at index 1 is next to 0 and 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit the earlier pattern. Wait, maybe there's another condition. Maybe when a 5 is between two 2s, or when it's adjacent to a 2 and another 5. Or perhaps there's a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look again. In Example 2's seventh input row, the output changes index 1 and 11 to 8. Let me check their neighbors:\n\nOriginal input row 7 (Example 2):\n\n[0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nSo index 1 is 5. The previous element is 0 (index 0), next is 0 (index 2). So why is it changed to 8? That doesn't involve a 2. Hmm, this contradicts the earlier pattern. Maybe there's another rule here. Let me check if there's a 2 elsewhere in that row. Looking at the input for Example 2's seventh row: the input is [0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]. No 2s present here. So the previous pattern can't explain this. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking at the output for Example 2's seventh row:\n\nOutput: [0, 8, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 8, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5]\n\nSo indexes 1 and 11 are changed to 8. Let me check their positions. Hmm, perhaps the pattern is different. Maybe it's not related to 2s but to some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing 5s that are in certain positions relative to the number 2 elsewhere in the array. But in this case, there are no 2s in that row. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the 8s are replacing 5s that are in positions where they are between two 5s. But that also doesn't fit here. Let me check other examples.\n\nWait, maybe the 8 is replacing a 5 that is part of a group of three or more consecutive 5s. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth row, the 5s starting at index 10 are part of a sequence: 5,2,5,2,5,5,5,2. The 5s at 12,13,14 are three consecutive 5s. But in the output, those are replaced with 8s, but the 5 at index 10 is not consecutive but is replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nIn Example 2's seventh input row, the 5 at index 1 is part of a single 5 (0,5,0...), but it's changed to 8. So that's not consecutive.\n\nAlternative approach: let's check all instances where 5 is changed to 8 and see the context.\n\nExample 0:\n\nRow 5: indices 10,12,13,14 \u2192 5s become 8s. Let's see the surrounding elements:\n\n- Index 10: 5 is between 2 (index9) and 2 (index11)\n- Index12: 5 is between 2 (index11) and 5 (index13)\n- Index13: between 5 (index12) and 5 (index14)\n- Index14: between 5 (index13) and 2 (index15)\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that any 5 that is adjacent to at least one 2 (either before or after) gets replaced by 8. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's row 5:\n\nIndex10: next to index9 (2) and index11 (2) \u2192 replaced.\n\nIndex12: next to index11 (2) \u2192 replaced.\n\nIndices13 and 14: next to index15 (2) eventually? Wait, index13 is next to 12 (5) and 14 (5). Index14 is next to 13 (5) and 15 (2). So index14 is next to a 2 on the right. So index12 is next to a 2 on the left (index11), index13 is between two 5s, index14 is next to a 2 on the right. But in the output, all three (12,13,14) are replaced. So maybe if a 5 is adjacent to a 2 anywhere in the list, even not directly next to it? That seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in between two 2s (anywhere in the row) are replaced. But how would that work?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a 5 is part of a group that is flanked by 2s. For example, between two 2s. Let's look at Example 3's fourth input row:\n\nInput: [5,0,0,5,5,5,2,5,2,2,2,0]\n\nOutput: [5,0,0,5,5,5,2,8,2,2,2,0]\n\nHere, the 5 at index7 is between 2 (index6) and 2 (index8) \u2192 replaced.\n\nIn Example 0's row5, the 5 at index10 is between 2s (index9 and 11). So replaced. Then the next 5s (12,13,14) are between index11 (2) and index15 (2). So maybe any 5 that is between two 2s in the entire list, regardless of their positions, gets replaced. But how to determine \"between\". For example, in Example0 row5, the 5s at 12,13,14 are between the 2 at index11 and the 2 at index15. So all the 5s between those two 2s are replaced.\n\nBut then, in Example2's seventh row, there are no 2s. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another pattern. Let me check Example2's seventh input and output again.\n\nInput row7 (Example2):\n\n[0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,8,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,8,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nSo two 5s are changed to 8. But there are no 2s in this row. So the previous idea is invalid.\n\nThis suggests that there's another condition where 5s are replaced with 8 even without 2s. So my initial hypothesis is wrong. Need to think differently.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the 8s are replacing 5s that are at certain positions, like every third 5 or something. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, let's look for other patterns. Maybe the 8s are replacing 5s that are part of a palindrome structure, or some symmetry. But without more data, this is hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing 5s that are adjacent to a 0. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's row5, the 5 at index10 is between 2 and 2, so that's not adjacent to 0. But in Example2's row7, the 5 at index1 is between 0 and 0. So maybe 5s adjacent to 0 are replaced. Let's check.\n\nBut in Example0's row5, the 5 at index10 is replaced, but it's between 2s, not 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 5s that are followed by a certain number of 5s. For example, in Example0's row5, after the 2s, there's a series of 5s. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing 5s that are part of a group that starts after a 2. For example, in Example0 row5, after index9 (2), the 5s until the next 2 are replaced. But how does that apply to other examples.\n\nIn Example2's row7, there are no 2s, but two 5s are replaced. So that can't be.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the transformation is that every occurrence of the number 5 that is immediately preceded by a 2 and followed by another 2 is replaced with 8. But in Example0's row5, the 5 at index10 is between two 2s (index9 and 11), so it's replaced. Then the next 5s are between 2 (index11) and 2 (index15). So perhaps all 5s between any two 2s are replaced with 8. But how to define \"between\".\n\nAlternatively, whenever a 5 is between two 2s, even with other numbers in between. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are inserted whenever a 5 is part of a sequence that includes a 2. For example, in rows where there are 2s, certain 5s are replaced. But in Example2's row7, there are no 2s but 5s are replaced. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the 8s are replacing 5s that are in the same position as a 2 in another row. But that seems too vague.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for all instances where a 5 is changed to 8 and see their positions in the input.\n\nExample0:\n\n- Row5: indices 10,12,13,14 \u2192 5s become 8. Input elements around them: index9 is 2, index11 is 2. So the 5 at 10 is between 2s. The 5s at 12,13,14 are after a 2 (index11) and before another 2 (index15).\n\nExample1:\n\n- Row3: input index6 is 2. Output index5 is 8. Wait, looking at Example1's row3 input:\n\nInput: [5,0,0,5,5,0,2,5,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nOutput: [5,0,0,5,5,0,2,5,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nNo changes here, but in row5 of Example1's input:\n\nInput: [0,5,0,5,2,5,2,2,2,0,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [0,5,0,5,2,8,2,2,2,0,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nHere, index5 is 5, replaced by 8. The elements around it are 2 (index4) and 5 (index6). Wait, index5 is between 2 and 5, but it's replaced. Hmm.\n\nIn Example1's row7:\n\nInput: [0,0,5,5,0,0,8,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5]\n\nWait, no, looking back, maybe I need to check the correct row. Example1's row5 input is:\n\n[5,5,0,0,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [5,5,0,0,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nNo change here. Wait, maybe I'm getting the rows mixed up. Let me look at Example1's input and output again.\n\nIn Example1's input, row5 is:\n\n[5,5,0,0,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput is the same, so no changes. But row6 in Example1's input is:\n\n[0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5]\n\nOutput changes the 5 at index6 to 8:\n\n[0,0,5,5,0,0,8,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5]\n\nBut in this input row6, the element at index6 is 5 (original input), and in output it's 8. The elements around it are 0 (index5) and 5 (index7). So why is this 5 replaced? There's no 2 nearby. This contradicts the earlier hypothesis.\n\nWait, maybe there's another pattern. For instance, every third 5 in a sequence is replaced with 8. Let's check. In Example0 row5, the sequence has multiple 5s. If we count the 5s starting after the 2s, maybe:\n\nInput: ... 5,2,5,2,5,5,5,2 ...\n\nOutput: ...5,2,8,2,8,8,8,2...\n\nSo here, after the first 2 (index9), the 5s at 10,12,13,14 are replaced. Maybe every 5 after a 2 until the next 2 is replaced. But that's not consistent with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing 5s that are part of a group of three or more consecutive 5s. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0 row5: 5,2,5,2,5,5,5,2. The three consecutive 5s (indices12-14) are replaced. So that fits. Also, the 5 at index10 is part of a single 5 (between 2s) but still replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nIn Example1 row6, the input has [0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5]. The output changes index6 (5) to 8. So the two 5s at positions 6 and 7 (5,5) become 8,5? No, in output it's 8 and 5. So maybe not consecutive.\n\nIn Example2's row7, the input has [0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]. The output changes indices1 and 11 to 8. Both of these are isolated 5s (not in consecutive sequences). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for the positions where 8 appears and see if there's a pattern in their indices. For example, maybe even or odd indices. But in Example0 row5, the changed indices are 10,12,13,14. 10 is even, 12 even, 13 odd, 14 even. Doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of certain elements triggers the change, but that's too vague.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the 8 is a combination of 5 and 2, like 5+2=7, but that's not 8. Or 5*2=10, not relevant. Maybe 5 is being replaced by 8 when certain conditions are met, but the exact conditions are unclear.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's row5 again, the 5s that are changed to 8 are all between two 2s. Let me recheck:\n\nInput: ...5,2,5,2,5,5,5,2...\n\nOutput: ...5,2,8,2,8,8,8,2...\n\nSo between the first 2 (index9) and the next 2 (index11), there's a 5 (index10) which becomes 8. Then between the 2 at index11 and the next 2 at index15, there are three 5s (indices12-14) which become 8s. So it's replacing all 5s that are between two 2s, even if there are multiple 2s in between.\n\nBut in Example1's row6, the input has no 2s but a 5 is changed to 8. That can't be explained by this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing 5s that are in the same position as a 2 in another row. But that seems unlikely and hard to track across rows.\n\nAnother possibility: looking at the entire list, maybe the 8s are placed where there's a 5 that is part of a certain pattern across all the rows. But that seems too broad.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 5 that is followed by a 2 in the next element is replaced by 8, and any 5 preceded by a 2 is also replaced. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0's row5:\n\n5 at index10 is followed by 2 (index11). So replaced by 8. The 5 at index12 is preceded by 2 (index11) \u2192 replaced. The 5 at index13 is preceded by 5 (index12) and followed by 5 (index14). Not replaced. Wait, but in the output, it's replaced. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, any 5 that is immediately followed by a 2 or preceded by a 2 is replaced by 8. So:\n\nIn Example0 row5:\n\n- index10: preceded by 2 (index9), followed by 2 (index11) \u2192 replaced.\n- index12: preceded by 2 (index11) \u2192 replaced.\n- index13: preceded by 5 (index12), followed by 5 (index14) \u2192 not replaced. But in output, it is replaced. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. This approach isn't working.\n\nLet me look at another example. Example3's fourth input row:\n\nInput: [5,0,0,5,5,5,2,5,2,2,2,0]\n\nOutput: [5,0,0,5,5,5,2,8,2,2,2,0]\n\nThe 5 at index7 is between 2 (index6) and 2 (index8) \u2192 replaced by 8. So this supports the idea that a 5 between two 2s is replaced. But how to explain the cases where there are no 2s.\n\nWait, in Example2's row7, the input has no 2s but 5s are replaced. So that must have a different condition. Let me check that again.\n\nExample2's row7 input:\n\n[0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nOutput:\n\n[0,8,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,8,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nSo the 5s at index1 and 11 are replaced with 8. Looking at their positions:\n\n- Index1: surrounded by 0 and 0.\n- Index11: surrounded by 0 (index10) and 5 (index12).\n\nNo 2s in the row. So what's special about these positions?\n\nMaybe the pattern involves the position of the 5 in the entire array. For example, every nth 5 is replaced. But that would require knowing the total number of 5s, which varies per row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are replacing 5s that are in the same position as a 2 in a different row. But that's not applicable here.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that when a 5 is surrounded by two zeros (0 on both sides), it's replaced by 8. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example2's row7:\n\n- Index1: 0,5,0 \u2192 yes, surrounded by zeros. So replaced by 8.\n- Index11: 0,5,5 \u2192 preceded by 0, followed by 5. Not surrounded by zeros. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in the output, index11 is replaced. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 5s that are between two zeros are replaced. But in index1, it's between two zeros. So replaced. Index11 is between 0 and 5, not replaced. But in the output, index11 is replaced. So no.\n\nAlternative approach: let's look at all the training examples and see if there's a common thread.\n\nLooking at all examples, the 8s appear in places where there are 2s nearby, but not always. There must be another rule. Let's think of possible transformations:\n\nAnother possibility: 5s that are part of a palindrome around a 2 are replaced. For example, if the sequence is 2,5,2, then the middle 5 becomes 8. But that would fit some cases but not others.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are replacing 5s that are part of a group where the sum of certain elements equals a value. But without more info, this is hard.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are replacing 5s that are in positions where the sum of their neighbors equals a certain number.\n\nFor example, in Example0's row5, index10: neighbors are 2 and 2 \u2192 sum 4. If that's the case, maybe sum of neighbors is 4, replace 5 with 8. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample3's row4:\n\n5 at index7 is between 2 (index6) and 2 (index8). Sum of neighbors is 4 \u2192 replaced.\n\nExample2's row7, index1: neighbors are 0 and 0 \u2192 sum 0. So if sum is 0, replace. But why would sum 0 trigger a replacement? That seems inconsistent.\n\nBut in Example2's row7, index1 has sum 0 (0+0), replaced. Index11 has neighbors 0 and 5 \u2192 sum 5. So not replaced. But in output, index11 is replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the 8s are replacing 5s that are in a sequence where there's a 2 somewhere in the row, and the 5 is in a certain position relative to that 2. For example, the first 5 after a 2 is replaced. But in Example0's row5, after the first 2 at index9, the first 5 is at index10, which is replaced. Then after the next 2 at index11, the first 5 is at index12, which is replaced. Then the next 5s are also replaced. So maybe all 5s after a 2 until another 2 are replaced.\n\nBut in Example2's row7, there are no 2s, but 5s are replaced. So that's not the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to find another approach. Perhaps look at the positions of 8s and see if there's a pattern in the indices.\n\nIn Example0's row5, the 8s are at indices 10,12,13,14. These are even and odd indices.\n\nIn Example1's row6, the 8 is at index6 (even).\n\nIn Example3's row4, the 8 is at index7 (odd).\n\nIn Example2's row7, the 8s are at indices1 and 11 (both odd).\n\nNo clear pattern here.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 8s are replacing 5s that are part of a certain structure, like being in the same column as a 2 in a different row. But the problem states that each row is processed independently. So the transformation is per row, not across rows.\n\nWait, each input is a list of rows (arrays), and each row is transformed independently. So the pattern must be per row.\n\nSo focusing on per-row transformations.\n\nLet me re-express the problem: For each row in the input, some 5s are replaced with 8s. What's the rule for that replacement?\n\nLooking at all training examples, the common factor is that whenever there's a 2 in the row, certain 5s are replaced. But there are exceptions where no 2s are present but 5s are replaced.\n\nWait, in Example2's row7, there are no 2s, but two 5s are replaced. So the rule must apply even without 2s.\n\nThis suggests that there are two conditions: one involving 2s and another not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing 5s that are in a certain position relative to the start or end of the row.\n\nIn Example0's row5, the replaced 5s are in the middle of the row.\n\nExample2's row7: replaced 5s are at indices1 and 11. Let's see the length of the row. The input row has 19 elements (indices0-18). Index1 is near the start, index11 is in the middle.\n\nNo obvious pattern.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 8s are replacing 5s that are at positions which are multiples of a certain number. For example, indices that are multiples of 3 or something. But in Example0's row5, indices 10,12,13,14. 10 is not a multiple of 3 (3*3=9, 3*4=12). 12 is multiple of 3, 13 and 14 are not. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the digits in the index. Not likely.\n\nAnother possibility: The number of 5s in the row. For example, every third 5 is replaced. But in Example0's row5, there are several 5s replaced. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are replacing 5s that are part of a group where the group's length is even or odd. But this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, looking back at Example2's row7:\n\nInput: [0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nOutput: [0,8,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,8,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nThe replaced 5s are at indices1 and 11. Let's see the positions:\n\n- Index1: position 2 in the row (if counting from 1), which is even?\n- Index11: position 12, which is even.\n\nBut in Example0's row5, indices10 (position 11), 12 (13), etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replaced 5s are at symmetric positions. For example, in a row of length 19, indices1 and 11 are symmetric around the center (index9). Let's check:\n\nRow length 19, indices 0-18. Center at 9. Index1 is 8 positions from start, and index11 is 8 positions from end (since 18-11=7, so not exactly). Not symmetric.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the pattern is that every 5 that is immediately followed by a 2 is replaced by 8, and every 5 that is immediately preceded by a 2 is also replaced by 8. Let's check:\n\nExample0 row5:\n\n5 at index10 is preceded by 2 (index9) \u2192 replaced.\n\n5 at index12 is preceded by 2 (index11) \u2192 replaced.\n\n5 at index14 is followed by 2 (index15) \u2192 replaced.\n\nSo all these are replaced. Then the 5s at indices13 and 14 (depending on direction) might be replaced if they are preceded by 2s. Wait, index13 is preceded by 5 (index12), so not replaced. But in the output, it is replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that any 5 that is adjacent (either before or after) to a 2 is replaced by 8. Let's test this.\n\nExample0 row5:\n\n- index10: adjacent to 2 on both sides \u2192 replaced.\n- index12: adjacent to 2 on left \u2192 replaced.\n- index13: adjacent to 5 on left and 5 on right \u2192 not replaced. But in output, it's replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nNo, this rule doesn't explain all cases.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 8s are replacing 5s that are part of a sequence that starts and ends with a 2, regardless of what's in between. For example, between two 2s, all 5s are replaced with 8s.\n\nIn Example0 row5:\n\nBetween index9 (2) and index15 (2), there are 5s at 10,12,13,14. All are replaced.\n\nIn Example3 row4:\n\nBetween index6 (2) and index8 (2), there's a 5 at7 \u2192 replaced.\n\nIn Example1 row5:\n\nInput row5: [0,5,0,5,2,5,2,2,2,0,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [0,5,0,5,2,8,2,2,2,0,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nHere, the 5 at index5 is between 2 (index4) and 2 (index6) \u2192 replaced.\n\nBut in Example1 row6:\n\nInput: [0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5]\n\nOutput: [0,0,5,5,0,0,8,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5]\n\nThe 5 at index6 is replaced. There's a 0 before and after. But why? No 2s here.\n\nThis indicates that there's another condition causing 5s to be replaced even without 2s. Perhaps the rule is a combination of two different conditions.\n\nMaybe when a 5 is between two 2s, it's replaced by 8, and when a 5 is between two 0s, it's replaced by 8 as well.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample2 row7:\n\nInput: [0,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nOutput: [0,8,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,8,5,5,5,0,5,5,5]\n\nThe replaced 5s are at indices1 and 11. Both are between two 0s.\n\nIndex1: 0,5,0 \u2192 replaced.\n\nIndex11: 0,5,5 \u2192 preceded by 0, followed by 5. Not between two 0s. So only index1 fits.\n\nBut in the output, index11 is replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: 5s that are between a 0 and a non-zero number are replaced. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 5s that are between two zeros are replaced. Only applies to index1 in Example2's row7. But index11 is replaced as well. So no.\n\nThis is very challenging. Let's try to see if there's any other pattern. Maybe the number of 5s in a row. For example, every third 5 is replaced. But in Example0's row5, there are multiple 5s replaced.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are replacing 5s that are at positions where the index is one less than a multiple of 3. Let's check Example0 row5's indices:\n\nIndices 10: 10+1=11 (not multiple of 3), 12:13, 13:14, 14:15. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: the 8s are replacing 5s that are part of a certain shape when the array is visualized as a grid. But since the rows are of varying lengths, this seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is that the 8s are replacing 5s that are in the same position as a 2 in another row. But this would require cross-row analysis, which the problem likely doesn't intend, as each row is processed independently.\n\nWait, the examples show that in some rows, 5s are replaced with 8s even without any 2s. So there must be at least two different rules.\n\nPerhaps the rule is:\n\n- If a 5 is adjacent to a 2 (before or after), replace it with 8.\n- Additionally, if a 5 is between two 0s, replace it with 8.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nIn Example0 row5:\n\n- 5s replaced are adjacent to 2s.\nIn Example2 row7:\n- 5s replaced are between 0s (index1) and between 0 and 5 (index11). But only the first one fits the second rule. So the second rule doesn't explain index11.\n\nAlternatively, the second rule is not between two 0s, but after a 0. For example, 0 followed by 5 followed by something else. But this is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. But given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that 5s are replaced with 8s when they are between two 2s. Even though there are exceptions like Example2's row7, perhaps there's a different rule for those cases. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my observation.\n\nAnother possibility: when a 5 is surrounded by 2s or is part of a sequence containing 2s, it's replaced. But when there are no 2s, certain other conditions are applied, like replacing 5s that are isolated (surrounded by 0s).\n\nGiven the limited time, I'll proceed to apply the main pattern observed in most examples: replace 5s that are between two 2s. For the test input, I'll look for such instances and replace the 5s with 8s. Additionally, in cases where a 5 is between two 0s (like in Example2's row7), replace it with 8. However, since this isn't consistently applied across all examples, I'll focus on the 2-related pattern.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input rows:\n\nRow4: [0,5,0,5,2,2,5,2,2,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nHere, there are 2s. Let's see:\n\nIndices4:2, index5:2, index7:2, index8:2.\n\nSo between indices4 and5 (both 2s), there's a 5 at index6 (but the element at 6 is 5, but in the input it's index6 is 5, index7 is 2. So 5 is followed by 2. Also, between indices7 and8 (both 2s), but there's no 5 there. Also, between indices5 and7: 5,2, but that's not between two 2s. Wait, the input row4 is:\n\n[0,5,0,5,2,2,5,2,2,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nSo the 2s are at indices4,5,7,8.\n\nLooking for 5s between two 2s:\n\n- Between indices4 and5 (both 2s): no, between them is the same index. Maybe consecutive 2s.\n\n- Between indices5 and7: indices5 is 2, index7 is 2. The elements between are index6:5. So 5 at index6 is between two 2s (indices5 and7). So replace with 8.\n\nSimilarly, between indices7 and8: consecutive 2s, no 5 in between.\n\nSo in this row, index6's 5 is between 2s and should be replaced with 8.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,5,0,5,2,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nLooking for 5s between 2s. There's a 2 at index6. Are there other 2s? No. So no replacements here based on 2s.\n\nRow6: [5,5,0,0,5,5,2,0,5,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n2 at index6. No other 2s. So no replacements based on 2s.\n\nRow8: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,2,5,2,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0]\n\n2s at indices11 and13. The 5 at index12 is between these two 2s. So replace with 8.\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,5,2,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\n2 at index13. No other 2s. So no replacement.\n\nRow14: [5,5,0,5,5,2,2,2,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\n2s at indices5,6,7. Between these, there are consecutive 2s, so 5s after them. For example, the 5s at indices8,9,10 are after a sequence of 2s. But not between two 2s. So no replacements based on that.\n\nRow16: [5,5,5,0,0,2,0,5,5,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,5,0,5,0,5,5]\n\n2s at indices5,11,12,13,14,15. Between indices5 and11: there are other elements. For example, the 5 at index8 is between indices5 (2) and11 (2). So any 5s between these two 2s would be replaced. Let's see the elements between indices5 and11:\n\nIndices5:2,6:0,7:5,8:5,9:0,10:0,11:2. So 5s at 7 and 8. These are between 2s. So replaced with 8s.\n\nSimilarly, between indices11 and15: all 2s. So no 5s there.\n\nRow17: [5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,5,5,0]\n\nNo 2s. So no replacements based on 2s. But maybe other conditions.\n\nRow18: [5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,0,5]\n\nNo 2s. So no replacements.\n\nSo applying the rule of replacing 5s between two 2s:\n\n- Row4: index6 (5 \u2192 8)\n- Row8: index12 (5 \u2192 8)\n- Row16: indices7 and8 (5 \u2192 8)\n\nBut wait, in row16:\n\nIndices5:2,6:0,7:5,8:5,9:0,10:0,11:2. The 5s at 7 and8 are between indices5 and11 (both 2s). So according to the rule, these should be replaced. However, there are other elements in between. The rule might require that the 5s are between two 2s with no other 2s in between, but in this case, they are between two 2s with other elements in between. So according to the previous examples, like Example0's row5 where 5s between two 2s with other elements are replaced, these should also be replaced.\n\nTherefore, in row16, indices7 and8 would become 8.\n\nSimilarly, in row16, there are 2s at indices11-15. The 5 at index16 is 5, which is after index15 (2) but no other 2 after it. So not replaced.\n\nSo for the test input, the rows that would have 8s are:\n\nRow4: index6 \u2192 8\n\nRow8: index12 \u21928\n\nRow16: indices7 and8 \u21928\n\nBut wait, in row16's input:\n\n[5,5,5,0,0,2,0,5,5,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,5,0,5,0,5,5]\n\nSo indices7 and8 are 5 and5. Between indices5 (2) and11 (2), there are 5s at7 and8. So these would be replaced with 8.\n\nAdditionally, in row14's input:\n\n[5,5,0,5,5,2,2,2,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\n2s at indices5,6,7. The 5s at indices8,9,10 are after the 2s but before the next 2? There's no 2 after them. So no replacement.\n\nNow, putting this together, the test output would have the following changes:\n\nRow4: [0,5,0,5,2,2,8,2,2,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nRow8: [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,2,8,2,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow16: [5,5,5,0,0,2,0,8,8,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,5,0,5,0,5,5]\n\nAre there any other rows with 2s?\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,5,0,5,2,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0]\n\nOnly one 2 at index6. So no replacement.\n\nRow6: [5,5,0,0,5,5,2,0,5,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nOnly one 2 at index6. So no.\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,5,2,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nOnly one 2 at index13. No.\n\nRow14: [5,5,0,5,5,2,2,2,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0]\n\n2s at 5,6,7. No other 2s after. So no.\n\nRow16: as discussed.\n\nNow, applying these changes to the test input.\n\nBut wait, there's another row in the test input:\n\nRow7: [5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nNo 2s. No replacement.\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nNo 2s.\n\nRow11: [0,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0,5,5]\n\nNo 2s.\n\nRow12: [5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,5]\n\nNo 2s.\n\nRow13: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,5]\n\nNo 2s.\n\nRow15: [5,0,0,0,5,2,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5]\n\nOnly one 2 at index5. So no replacement.\n\nRow17: [5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,5,5,0]\n\nNo 2s.\n\nRow18: [5,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,0,5]\n\nNo 2s.\n\nSo the final test output will have 8s in rows4,8,16 as per the changes above.\n\nBut wait, the problem expects the same format as the training examples. Each output row corresponds to the input row with some 5s replaced by 8s.\n\nThus, the final answer should be the test input with the identified 5s replaced by 8s.",
