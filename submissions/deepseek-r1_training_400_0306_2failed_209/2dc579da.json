        "cot_1": "Okay, let's look at these examples to figure out the pattern. So, the input is a list of lists (like a matrix), and the output is another list of lists. I need to see how each input matrix is transformed into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 5x5 matrix. The output is two rows: [8,8] and [4,8]. Hmm. Let me check the original input. The third row is all 3s. The output seems to be taking parts of the other rows. Let me see the positions. The original rows are:\n\nRow 0: [8,8,3,8,8]\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: all 3s\nRow 3: same as row 0\nRow 4: [4,8,3,8,8]\n\nThe output is [8,8] and [4,8]. Maybe they're taking the first two elements of certain rows. Let's see. The output rows in example 0 are two lines. The first line [8,8] could be from the first two elements of row 0. The second line [4,8] might be the first two elements of row 4. But why those rows? Because rows 0,1,3,4 have 8,8 as the first two except row4 starts with 4. The middle row (row2) is all 3s. So maybe the output is the rows that are not the middle row, and taking the first elements up to the middle? Wait, but the output is shorter. Let me check the dimensions. The input is 5x5, output is two rows of 2 elements each. Wait, no. Wait in example 0, the output has two arrays: first [8,8], then [4,8]. So maybe they're taking the first two elements of the first and last row that are not the all-same row.\n\nWait, but the output is two lines. Let me think again. Another approach: look for the position of the all-same row. In example 0, the third row (index 2 if starting from 0?) is all 3s. The output rows might be the rows adjacent to that middle row. Wait, the input has 5 rows. The middle is row 2 (index 2). Then the rows above and below are rows 0,1,3,4. But the output in example 0 is two lines. Hmm, maybe the output is the first two elements of the rows that are immediately above and below the all-same row. Wait in example 0, the all-same row is row2. The rows adjacent are row1 and row3. But row1 is [8,8,3,8,8], so taking first two elements gives [8,8], and row3 is same. Then where does [4,8] come from? Oh wait, the last row in input is row4: [4,8,3,8,8], so first two elements are 4 and8. Maybe the output includes the first two elements of the rows that are not part of the all-same rows and perhaps the ones that are different from the others. Alternatively, maybe the all-same row is the central row, and the output is the elements from the rows above and below that central row, but taking only the parts before and after the central element. Wait, in example 0, each row has a 3 in the middle (third position). So the middle element is 3, and the output could be the elements before the middle and after the middle? Wait in example 0's output, [8,8] and [4,8]. The first row's first two elements are 8,8. The last row's first two are 4,8. But why those? Alternatively, maybe the output is taking the elements to the left and right of the center, excluding the center. Let's see in example 0. Each row (except the all-3s row) has 8s except the middle element. For rows 0,1,3,4 (except row2), the first two elements are 8,8 except row4 which starts with 4. So maybe the output is the first two elements of the first and last row (excluding the all-3 row). Wait in example 0's input, the first row is [8,8,3,8,8], and the last row is [4,8,3,8,8]. The output is [8,8] and [4,8], which are the first two elements of the first row and the first two of the last row. But why not the other rows?\n\nWait looking at example1. The input is a 7x7 matrix. The output is three rows. The input's fourth row (index3 if 0-based) is all 2s. The output has [4,4,4], [4,1,4], [4,4,4]. Looking at the input rows adjacent to the all-2s row. The rows above are rows 0,1,2 and below rows 4,5,6. The output rows are three, maybe taking the middle three rows around the all-2s row. But the output rows in example1 are [4,4,4], [4,1,4], [4,4,4], which correspond to the rows 1,2,3 maybe? Wait in example1, the all-same row is the fourth row (index3?), and the output is three rows. The input's row1 is [4,4,4,2,4,1,4], so the output's middle row is [4,1,4]. So the output rows are the three rows that are adjacent to the all-same row. But how are they processed? The output in example1's first line is [4,4,4], which is the first three elements of row0? Row0 is [4,4,4,2,4,4,4], so first three elements are 4,4,4. The middle row of output is [4,1,4], which is elements 5,6,7? Wait the input row1 is [4,4,4,2,4,1,4]. The elements around the 2 (position3) would be positions 2,3,4? Or maybe the elements before the all-same column and after. Wait perhaps the all-same row is in the middle, and the output is taking the elements to the left and right of the central element. Alternatively, maybe the output is the elements around the central element, excluding the central column. For example, in example0, the central element is 3, and the output is the first two and last two elements. Wait in example0's output, each line has two elements. The input rows (except all-3s) are [8,8,3,8,8]. If we exclude the middle element (3), then left two are 8,8 and right two are 8,8. But the output in example0 is [8,8] and [4,8]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait maybe the output is taking the left part (before the middle) and the right part (after the middle) for each row, but only for the rows that are adjacent to the all-same row. So in example0, the all-same row is the middle row. The rows adjacent would be row1 and row3. Wait, but the output is two rows, which might correspond to the first and last rows. Alternatively, maybe the output is the first and last elements of each row except the all-same rows. Not sure.\n\nLooking at example2. The input is an 11x11 matrix. The output has five rows. The all-same row is the sixth row (index5?), which is all 1s. The output rows are [3,3,3,3,3], [3,3,3,3,3], [3,8,3,3,3], [3,3,3,3,3], [3,3,3,3,3]. Each of these is the first five elements of the rows above and below the all-1s row. Wait, the input rows above the all-1s row (row5) are rows 0-4. The output has five rows, which might correspond to the rows 0-4, but taking the first five elements. Wait in example2's output, each row is the first five elements of the original rows except the all-1s row. For example, row0 in input is [3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3], and the first five elements are [3,3,3,3,3], which matches the output's first row. Similarly, row2 in input has first five elements [3,8,3,3,3], which matches the third output row. Then the output in example2 is all the rows except the all-1s row, and each output row is the first five elements of the original rows. But wait, the original input has 11 rows, and the output is 5 rows. So maybe the output is the rows that are above and below the all-same row, but how many?\n\nWait in example0, the input is 5 rows, the all-same row is row2. The output has two rows. The original rows are 5, so output has (5-1)/2 *2 = 4? No, example0's output is 2 rows. Hmm. Maybe the output includes the rows that are adjacent to the all-same row, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output consists of the rows that are not the all-same row, but trimmed to exclude the central element and the elements after. For example, in example0, each row (except the all-3s) is [8,8,3,8,8]. The middle element is 3, so trimming the middle element and after would leave the first two elements [8,8]. But for the last row [4,8,3,8,8], trimming would leave [4,8]. So the output is the first two elements of each row except the all-same row. But in example0, the all-same row is one, and the output has two rows. Wait the input has five rows, so four non-all-same rows. But the output is two rows. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait example1: input is 7 rows, output is 3 rows. The output rows correspond to the rows that are immediately adjacent to the all-same row. For example, the all-same row is row3 (all 2s). The rows around it are rows 2,4, and maybe others. But the output in example1 has three rows. Let's look:\n\nOriginal input rows:\nRow0: [4,4,4,2,4,4,4]\nRow1: [4,4,4,2,4,1,4]\nRow2: [4,4,4,2,4,4,4]\nRow3: all 2s\nRow4: [4,4,4,2,4,4,4]\nRow5: same as row4\nRow6: same as row4\n\nThe output is three rows: [4,4,4], [4,1,4], [4,4,4]. These correspond to rows 1, and maybe others. Wait row1's output is [4,1,4], which is elements 4,1,4 from the original row1? No. Original row1 is [4,4,4,2,4,1,4]. So if we take elements 0,1,2: 4,4,4 (the first three), then elements 4,5,6: 4,1,4. So maybe splitting each row into two parts around the all-same element. But how? The all-same row's column is position3 (0-based?), since in example1, all the non-all-same rows have a 2 in the fourth position. So for each row except the all-2s row, the elements before position3 and after. So for row0, elements 0-2: [4,4,4], elements4-6: [4,4,4]. But the output for example1 has [4,4,4], [4,1,4], [4,4,4]. Which would be the left and right parts of rows around the all-same row. Wait in example1's output, each line is three elements. So maybe the output is taking the left part (elements before the center) and the right part (elements after the center) of each row that is adjacent to the all-same row. Then combining them.\n\nBut how do the examples line up?\n\nLooking back at example0. The all-same row is the middle. For each non-all-same row, split into left and right parts. The left part would be elements before the center. The center is at position2 (since the row has 5 elements). So elements 0 and1 (left), elements3 and4 (right). For example0, the first row is [8,8,3,8,8]. Left part is [8,8], right part [8,8]. But the output is [8,8] and [4,8]. So perhaps the output is combining the left parts of the top rows and the right parts of the bottom rows. Or maybe the output is the left parts of the rows above the all-same row and the right parts of the rows below. Wait example0's output is two rows: [8,8] and [4,8]. The first comes from the left part of the first row (elements 0,1) and the second comes from the left part of the last row (elements 0,1). Or maybe the first output row is the left parts of the first and last rows above the all-same row, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternative approach: Find the all-same row in each input. Then, for each row except that, take a certain number of elements before and after the center. Then, how many elements? For example0, the all-same row is in the middle (position2). The rows above are 0,1; the rows below are 3,4. The output is two rows. So maybe take the left part (before center) of the first row above and the left part of the first row below? Or maybe take the left parts of all the rows above and the right parts of the rows below. But example0's output is [8,8] and [4,8]. The first comes from row0's left, the second from row4's left. So perhaps for each row above the all-same row, take the left part, and for each row below, take the left part. But why then in example1, the output is three rows. Let's see example1's all-same row is row3. The rows above are 0,1,2; rows below are4,5,6. The output is three rows. For example, the left parts of rows1,2,3 (but row3 is all-same) and the right parts of rows4,5,6? But in example1's output, the three rows are [4,4,4], [4,1,4], [4,4,4]. Which could be the left parts of rows0,1,2 (the three above the all-same row) and the right parts of rows4,5,6 (the three below). But how are they combined? Because the output has three rows, perhaps each output row is the left part of the above row and the right part of the corresponding below row. Or maybe it's left parts of the rows above and right parts of the rows below, concatenated. But example1's output rows have three elements each. Let's check:\n\nRow0 left part (elements0-2): [4,4,4]\nRow4 right part (elements4-6): [4,4,4]\nSo combining left and right would be [4,4,4,4,4,4], but the output rows are three elements. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, for each row above the all-same row, take the left part (elements before the center) and for each row below, take the right part (elements after the center). Then, combine them vertically. For example, in example1:\n\nRows above the all-same row (row3) are rows0,1,2. Their left parts (elements0-2) are:\n\nrow0: [4,4,4]\nrow1: [4,4,4]\nrow2: [4,4,4]\n\nRows below the all-same row (rows4,5,6) have right parts (elements4-6):\n\nrow4: [4,4,4]\nrow5: [4,4,4]\nrow6: [4,4,4]\n\nBut the output is:\n\n[4,4,4]\n[4,1,4]\n[4,4,4]\n\nWait, the middle output row is [4,1,4], which comes from row1's right part? Or perhaps row1's right part is elements4-6: [4,1,4]. So if we combine the left parts of the rows above and the right parts of the rows below, then for example1, rows0's left is [4,4,4], row4's right is [4,4,4] \u2192 output row [4,4,4,4,4,4], but the output rows are three elements. So this approach might not work.\n\nWait maybe the output is the left part of the rows above and the right part of the same rows. Like for each row above, take the left and right parts. But how?\n\nAnother idea: For each row except the all-same row, split into two parts around the center column. Then, create new rows by taking the left parts of the upper rows and the right parts of the lower rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the set of rows that are not the all-same row, but trimmed to the left half (excluding the center element) and the right half (excluding the center element). Then, for example, in example0:\n\nEach non-all-same row has 5 elements. The center is position2 (element3 is index2). So left half is first two elements, right half is last two. The output for example0 is two rows: [8,8] and [4,8]. Which are the left parts of the first row and the left part of the last row. Hmm, not sure.\n\nIn example2, the output is the first five elements of each row except the all-same row. The input rows are 11 elements, the output rows are five elements. So first five elements of each row except the all-1s row. The output in example2 has five rows, which are the first five rows (excluding the all-same row). But in example2's input, there are 11 rows. The all-same row is row5. The rows above are 0-4 (5 rows) and below are 6-10 (5 rows). But the output is the first five elements of each of the rows 0-4 and 6-10? But example2's output has five rows, each of five elements. Let's check: the output rows are [3,3,3,3,3], which is the first five of row0; the same for row1; row2's first five are [3,8,3,3,3]; row3 and row4 first five are all 3s. Then the output has five rows, which are the first five rows (rows0-4). But why not the rows below? Because the example2's output has five rows, which is the same as the number of rows above the all-same row. Hmm, but in example1, the output has three rows. Maybe the output includes rows above and below the all-same row, but limited to the same number of rows as the all-same row's position. For example, if the all-same row is at index k, then take k rows above and k rows below, and for each of those rows, take the elements up to the all-same column. Wait, example0 has the all-same row at index2. So k=2. Take 2 rows above (rows0 and1) and 2 rows below (rows3 and4). Then for each of those rows, take elements before the center. Example0's rows0 and1 have first two elements [8,8], rows3 and4 have first two elements [8,8] and [4,8]. But the output in example0 is two rows. So maybe it's taking the first two rows above and the first two rows below, and taking their left parts, but combining them. But the output is two rows. If example0's output is rows0 and4's left parts, then that makes sense. But why those rows? Because rows0 and4 are the first and last non-all-same rows. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the all-same row is the central row, and the output is the rows before and after that row, but each trimmed to exclude the center and after. For example, in example0, the output includes the rows before the all-same row, taking the left part, and the rows after, taking the left part. But example0's output has two rows: the first two elements of row0 and row4.\n\nWait, in example0's input, the all-same row is in the middle (position2). The rows above are rows0,1, and the rows below are3,4. But the output is [8,8] and [4,8]. The first is from row0's left, the second from row4's left. So maybe the output is the left parts of the first row above and the first row below the all-same row. But why not rows1 and3? That doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the positions of the unique elements. In example0's output, the second line is [4,8]. That comes from row4's first two elements. Row4 is [4,8,3,8,8]. So the 4 is unique. Maybe the output is capturing the rows where there's a variation compared to the others. But in example0, row4 is the only one with a 4 in the first element, so it's included. The other rows are the same as row0, so maybe they are merged into one line. But example0's output is two lines, which could be the first row and the last row with variations.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the rows that have elements different from the all-same row's value. So for each row, if it's not all the same as the all-same row, then include it in the output, but trimmed to exclude the central element and beyond. But in example0, the all-same row is 3s. The other rows have 8s and 4 in row4. So the output for those rows is their first two elements. But why two elements? Because the center is at position2, so the elements before are 0 and1.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern seems to be:\n\n1. Identify the row that consists of all the same number (the all-same row). This is the central row in each example.\n2. For all other rows, take the elements before the central column (exclusive) to form the output rows.\n3. The output includes these truncated rows from all non-all-same rows.\n\nWait, but in example0, the output has two rows. The input has five rows, one is all-same, so four non-all-same. But the output is two rows. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative: The output includes only the rows that are adjacent to the all-same row (the rows immediately before and after), and trims each to the left of the center. But example0's output has two rows: the first row and the last row. Wait, example0's all-same row is row2. The rows immediately before and after are rows1 and3. But rows1 and3 in example0 are the same as row0 and each other. Their left parts are [8,8]. So why isn't the output two rows of [8,8] and [8,8]? But the example0's output is [8,8] and [4,8]. So perhaps the output includes all the rows except the all-same row, but trimmed to the left part. Then in example0, there are four rows, but the output has two. So maybe only the first and last rows are taken.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first and last non-all-same rows, each trimmed to the left part. In example0, the first non-all-same row is row0, left part [8,8], and the last is row4, left part [4,8]. Which matches the output. In example1, the first non-all-same row is row0, and the last non-all-same row is row6. Their left parts are [4,4,4] and [4,4,4]. But the example1's output is three rows, which includes more than just the first and last. So that doesn't fit.\n\nLooking back at example1's output. The three rows are [4,4,4], [4,1,4], [4,4,4]. These correspond to the left parts of rows0,1,2 and the right parts of rows4,5,6. Because rows0,1,2 have left parts [4,4,4], [4,4,4], [4,4,4], and rows4,5,6 have right parts [4,4,4], [4,4,4], [4,4,4]. But the output includes a middle row with [4,1,4], which comes from row1's right part (elements4-6:4,1,4). So perhaps the output is combining the left parts of the rows above the all-same row and the right parts of the rows below. For example, for each row above the all-same row, take the left part, and for each row below, take the right part, then combine them into one array. But how?\n\nExample1 has three rows above and three rows below. So the output would be three rows, each consisting of the left part of an above row and the right part of a below row. For example:\n\nRow0's left (4,4,4) + row4's right (4,4,4) \u2192 [4,4,4,4,4,4] (but output is three elements)\nNo, that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the left parts of the rows above and the right parts of the rows below, interleaved. But example1's output is three rows, each three elements. Maybe each output row is the left part of an above row and the right part of a corresponding below row. For example, row0's left (4,4,4) and row4's right (4,4,4) \u2192 merged into [4,4,4,4,4,4], but the output is three elements. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: The output is made by taking the rows that are not the all-same row, and for each such row, take the elements before the center and the elements after the center, excluding the center itself. Then, each row is split into two parts, and the output includes the left parts of the upper rows and the right parts of the lower rows. For example, in example0:\n\nEach non-all-same row is split into left (elements0-1) and right (elements3-4). The output has two rows: left part of row0 and left part of row4. But why left parts of the upper and lower rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the left parts of the upper rows and the right parts of the lower rows. So for example0, upper rows (rows0 and1) have left parts [8,8], lower rows (rows3 and4) have right parts [8,8]. So output is [8,8], [8,8], but example0's output is [8,8], [4,8]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe a different approach: look for the position of the all-same row and how the output is structured. Let's count the rows and columns in each example.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput rows:5, columns:5. Output rows:2, columns:2.\n\nThe all-same row is row2 (length5). Output rows are 2. So 5-1=4 non-all-same rows. Output rows are 2, so perhaps they're taking every other row.\n\nExample1:\n\nInput rows:7, columns:7. Output rows:3. 7-1=6 non-all-same rows. Output rows:3. So perhaps taking half of them.\n\nExample2:\n\nInput rows:11, columns:11. Output rows:5. 11-1=10 non-all-same rows. Output rows:5. So 10/2=5.\n\nAh, this seems to be a pattern. The number of output rows is (number of input rows -1)/2. For example0: (5-1)/2=2, which matches. Example1: (7-1)/2=3. Example2: (11-1)/2=5. So the output has (n-1)/2 rows, where n is the number of input rows.\n\nThen, what about the columns? In example0, input columns are 5, output columns are 2. (5-1)/2=2. Similarly, example1 has 7 columns. (7-1)/2=3, which matches the output columns. Example2 has 11 columns. (11-1)/2=5, which matches the output columns.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- The output has (number of input rows -1)/2 rows, and (number of input columns -1)/2 columns.\n\n- The output consists of the elements from the input matrix, excluding the all-same row and the all-same column. But how?\n\nWait, in example0, the all-same row is row2 (the third row). The output rows are the first two and the last two rows (excluding row2). But the output has only two rows. Similarly, the columns in example0's output are two, so the input columns excluding the middle column (which is index2).\n\nSo the process could be:\n\n1. Find the all-same row (the central row).\n\n2. Find the all-same column (the central column). Because in example0, all rows except the all-same row have a 3 in the middle. So the central column is all 3s except for the all-same row which is all 3s.\n\nWait in example0's input, the central column (index2) has 3 in all rows. So the all-same column is column2.\n\nSimilarly, in example1, the central column is column3 (index3), which has 2 in all non-all-same rows. The all-same row (row3) has all 2s.\n\nIn example2, the central column is index5, which has 1 in all rows except the all-same row (row5), which is all 1s.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n- The central row is all-same.\n\n- The central column (same index as the central row) is also all-same (except in the all-same row where it's the same value).\n\nThen, the output is formed by excluding the central row and central column, and taking the top-left and bottom-right quadrants.\n\nWait, example0's input is 5x5. Excluding row2 and column2, the remaining is 4 rows and4 columns. Split into four quadrants. The top-left would be rows0-1, columns0-1. The bottom-right would be rows3-4, columns3-4. The output is two rows, each two elements. The first output row is [8,8], which is rows0-1, columns0-1. The second output row is [4,8], which is rows3-4, columns0-1. Wait, that doesn't match. Maybe the output is the top-left and bottom-left quadrants.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the elements from the input matrix that are not in the central row or central column. But for example0, removing row2 and column2, the remaining elements are:\n\nFor row0: [8,8,8,8]\nRow1: [8,8,8,8]\nRow3: [8,8,8,8]\nRow4: [4,8,8,8]\n\nBut these are four rows each with four elements. How do we get the output of two rows each with two elements? Perhaps taking the top-left and bottom-left quadrants. So the top-left would be rows0-1, columns0-1 \u2192 [8,8] and [8,8]. The bottom-left would be rows3-4, columns0-1 \u2192 [8,8] and [4,8]. The output is two rows from these quadrants. But example0's output is [8,8] and [4,8]. So perhaps only the first and last rows of the remaining elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, after removing the central row and column, the output takes the first half of the remaining rows and the first half of the remaining columns. For example, in example0: after removing row2 and column2, there are four rows and four columns. Split into two parts: the first two rows and columns \u2192 2x2 matrix. Which would give [8,8] and [8,8] from rows0 and1. But the output's second row is [4,8], which comes from row4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is the elements from the input matrix that are in the same positions as the all-same row and column. For example, the output includes the rows above the all-same row and the columns to the left of the all-same column. So in example0, the all-same row is row2, columns0-1. So the output would be rows0-1, columns0-1 \u2192 [8,8] and [8,8], but the output has [8,8] and [4,8]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try to see the general pattern from the examples:\n\nIn example0:\n\nInput is 5x5. Output is 2x2.\n\nThe output's first row is from row0, columns0-1: [8,8].\n\nThe output's second row is from row4, columns0-1: [4,8].\n\nSo the output is taking the first and last rows (excluding the all-same row), and taking the first two columns.\n\nIn example1:\n\nInput is 7x7. Output is3x3.\n\nThe first output row is row0, columns0-2: [4,4,4].\n\nThe second output row is row1, columns0-2: [4,4,4] but wait no, row1's first three are [4,4,4]. But the output's second row is [4,1,4], which is row1's columns4-6: [4,1,4]. Wait example1's output is three rows, each of three elements. The first row is [4,4,4], which is row0's columns0-2. The second row is [4,1,4], which is row1's columns4-6. The third row is [4,4,4], which is row2's columns0-2. But how? Alternatively, perhaps the output is combining the left part of the upper rows and the right part of the lower rows. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, example1's output is:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[4,1,4]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nLooking at the input rows:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4,2,4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [4,4,4,2,4,1,4]\n\nRow2: [4,4,4,2,4,4,4]\n\nRow3: all 2s\n\nRow4: [4,4,4,2,4,4,4]\n\nRow5: same as row4\n\nRow6: same as row4\n\nThe output rows could be:\n\nRow0's first three elements (left of the center column3): [4,4,4]\n\nRow1's last three elements (right of column3): [4,1,4]\n\nRow2's first three elements: [4,4,4]\n\nSo the output is taking rows0-2's left parts and rows4-6's right parts. But the output is three rows. So maybe the output is the first three rows (rows0-2) left parts and the last three rows (rows4-6) right parts, but merged. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is the left part of the rows above the all-same row and the right part of the rows below the all-same row. So for example:\n\nIn example1, the all-same row is row3. Rows above are0-2. Take their left parts (columns0-2): [4,4,4], [4,4,4], [4,4,4]. Rows below are4-6. Take their right parts (columns4-6): [4,4,4], [4,4,4], [4,4,4]. Then the output is the combination of these two groups. But the output has three rows. If we stack them, we would have six rows, but the example's output has three. So maybe it's taking the left parts of the upper rows and the right parts of the lower rows, but interleaved or averaged.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nAnother approach: The output consists of the rows that are not the all-same row, and for each of those rows, we take the elements that are not in the all-same column. So if the all-same row is row k and column k, then each output row is the row with the k-th element removed, and then the output is all such rows except the all-same row.\n\nFor example0:\n\nAll-same row is row2, column2. The other rows are0,1,3,4. For each of these, remove element2 (3) and take the remaining elements. So row0 becomes [8,8,8,8]. But the output is two rows of two elements each. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: The output is a cross-section of the matrix, taking the elements that are not in the central row or column and are in the same quadrant. For example, after removing the central row and column, the matrix is divided into four quadrants. The output could be one of these quadrants.\n\nExample0: After removing row2 and column2, the matrix is 4x4. The top-left quadrant is rows0-1, columns0-1 \u2192 [8,8], [8,8]. The top-right is rows0-1, columns3-4 \u2192 [8,8], [8,8]. The bottom-left is rows3-4, columns0-1 \u2192 [8,8], [4,8]. The bottom-right is rows3-4, columns3-4 \u2192 [8,8], [8,8]. The output is two rows: [8,8] and [4,8], which matches the bottom-left quadrant.\n\nExample1: After removing row3 and column3, the matrix is 6x6. The quadrants would be:\n\nTop-left: rows0-2, columns0-2 \u2192 3x3 matrix of 4s.\n\nTop-right: rows0-2, columns4-6 \u2192 3x3 matrix of 4s except for row1, which has 1.\n\nBottom-left: rows4-6, columns0-2 \u2192 3x3 matrix of 4s.\n\nBottom-right: rows4-6, columns4-6 \u2192 3x3 matrix of 4s.\n\nThe output is:\n\n[4,4,4]\n\n[4,1,4]\n\n[4,4,4]\n\nWhich matches the top-right quadrant of the original matrix. For example, row1's columns4-6 are [4,1,4], which is the middle row of the output.\n\nExample2: After removing row5 and column5, the matrix is 10x10. The output is the top-left quadrant (rows0-4, columns0-4) \u2192 5x5 matrix. This matches example2's output, which is the first five elements of the first five rows, excluding the all-1 row.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n1. Find the all-same row and column (central row and column).\n\n2. Remove that row and column.\n\n3. Take the top-left quadrant of the remaining matrix.\n\nExample0: after removing row2 and column2, take the bottom-left quadrant (rows3-4, columns0-1). Wait no. Example0's output is two rows: [8,8] and [4,8]. Those are from rows0 and4, columns0-1. So perhaps the output is the rows that are in the same positions relative to the all-same row and column. For example, the output includes rows from the first half and the second half.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the elements from the rows before the all-same row and the columns after the all-same column, plus the rows after the all-same row and columns before the all-same column. Not sure.\n\nBut based on example0, example1, and example2, the pattern seems to be that the output is the top-left quadrant of the matrix after removing the central row and column.\n\nExample0:\n\nAfter removing row2 and column2, the matrix is 4x4. The top-left quadrant is 2x2:\n\nrow0-1, column0-1:\n\n[8,8]\n\n[8,8]\n\nBut the output is [8,8] and [4,8]. So that's not the case.\n\nWait example0's output is two rows: [8,8] and [4,8]. These are the first two elements of row0 and row4. But row4 is below the all-same row. So perhaps the output is the first elements of the rows above the all-same row and the first elements of the rows below.\n\nIn example0, rows above are0-1, rows below are3-4. So take first two elements of row0 and row4. That gives [8,8] and [4,8].\n\nIn example1, rows above are0-2, rows below are4-6. Take first three elements of row0, row1, row2, and last three elements of row4,5,6. But the output is three rows. For example, row0's first three elements [4,4,4], row1's last three elements [4,1,4], row2's first three elements [4,4,4]. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output consists of the first half of the rows above the all-same row, taking their left part, and the first half of the rows below, taking their left part. But in example0, it's two rows: one from above, one from below.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the rows that are in the same position relative to the all-same row, but taking the left part. For example, in example0, the all-same row is in the middle. So the first row and the last row are mirrored. The output takes their left parts.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Given the time I've spent, I'll try to formulate the pattern:\n\nThe output consists of the rows that are not the all-same row, and for each of these rows, take the elements before the all-same column. The output is the first half of these rows (excluding the all-same row), taking the first half of their elements.\n\nFor example:\n\n- In example0, the all-same row is row2. The other rows are0,1,3,4. Take the first two rows (0 and1) and last two rows (3 and4). For each of these, take the first two elements. But the output is two rows. So maybe only the first and last of these rows. So row0 and row4, giving [8,8] and [4,8].\n\n- In example1, the all-same row is row3. The other rows are0,1,2,4,5,6. Take the first three (0,1,2) and last three (4,5,6). For each, take the first three elements. Then output is rows0,1,2's first three elements. But example1's output includes row1's elements [4,1,4], which is not the first three. So this is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the correct pattern is: For each row except the all-same row, take the elements to the left of the all-same column. Then, the output is the first half of these rows. For example0, four non-all-same rows: take the first two (rows0 and1) and their left parts ([8,8] each). But the output has two rows. So perhaps only the first and last rows of the non-all-same rows. In example0, rows0 and4 are first and last. Their left parts are [8,8] and [4,8].\n\nIn example1, the non-all-same rows are0,1,2,4,5,6. First and last are0 and6. Their left parts are [4,4,4] each. But example1's output is three rows. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: For each of the training examples, the output is the same as the input but with the all-same row and all-same column removed, and then the matrix is trimmed to the upper-left quadrant. For example:\n\nExample0: input 5x5. Remove row2 and column2 \u2192 4x4. Take upper-left 2x2 \u2192 first two rows and first two columns.\n\nOutput:\n\n[8,8]\n\n[8,8]\n\nBut example0's output is different. So this is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think the pattern is that the output consists of the rows above the all-same row, taking the elements before the all-same column, and the rows below the all-same row, taking the elements before the all-same column. So for example0:\n\nRows above the all-same row (row2) are0 and1. Rows below are3 and4. Take the elements before the all-same column (index2) \u2192 elements0 and1. So for rows0,1 \u2192 [8,8], [8,8]. For rows3,4 \u2192 [8,8], [4,8]. The output is [8,8] and [4,8], which are the first and last rows of these four.\n\nExample1:\n\nRows above the all-same row (row3) are0,1,2. Rows below are4,5,6. Take elements0-2 (before column3). The output is:\n\nRow0: [4,4,4]\n\nRow1: [4,4,4]\n\nRow2: [4,4,4]\n\nRows4: [4,4,4]\n\nRow5: [4,4,4]\n\nRow6: [4,4,4]\n\nBut the output in example1 is three rows, so perhaps the first three and last three are combined, but how?\n\nExample1's output is three rows: [4,4,4], [4,1,4], [4,4,4]. This doesn't fit. So this pattern is invalid.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to arrive at a solution, I'll proceed with the following pattern:\n\nThe output is formed by taking, for each row except the all-same row, the elements before the all-same column. Then, the output includes these rows, but only the first and last ones.\n\nFor example0, the elements before column2 are [8,8] for rows0,1,3 and [4,8] for row4. The output includes rows0 and4, giving [8,8] and [4,8].\n\nFor example1, the elements before column3 are [4,4,4] for rows0,1,2,4,5,6. But the output is three rows: [4,4,4], [4,1,4], [4,4,4]. This suggests that the middle row is different, which might be row1's elements after the all-same column. So perhaps the output is a combination of elements before and after the all-same column.\n\nAlternatively, the output consists of the elements to the left and right of the all-same column, but only for certain rows.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll try to apply the following logic to the test input:\n\nTest input is 13x13. The all-same row is the seventh row (index6) which is all 0s. The all-same column is index6 (since all rows except the all-same row have 0 in column6). So for each row except the all-same row, we take the elements before column6.\n\nThe test input rows are 13, so excluding the all-same row, we have 12 rows. Each row has elements before column6 (indices0-5) and after (indices7-12). The output would be the elements before column6 for each of these rows, and then take the first and last rows of these, or some other pattern.\n\nBut according to the examples:\n\nExample0: 5 rows, output 2 rows \u2192 2 = (5-1)/2.\n\nExample1: 7 rows, output 3 rows \u2192 (7-1)/2=3.\n\nExample2:11 rows, output5 rows \u2192 (11-1)/2=5.\n\nSo for the test input, which has 13 rows, the output should have (13-1)/2=6 rows.\n\nEach output row has (13-1)/2=6 columns.\n\nBut the test input's output should be a list of lists, each of length 6.\n\nBut according to the examples, the output is structured as follows:\n\nFor example0, each output row is the first two elements of certain rows.\n\nFor example1, each output row is three elements, which is (7-1)/2=3.\n\nFor example2, each output row is five elements, (11-1)/2=5.\n\nSo the pattern is: output rows are (n-1)/2 in count, and each row has (m-1)/2 elements, where n is the number of input rows and m the number of input columns.\n\nSo for the test input, 13 rows \u2192 6 output rows. 13 columns \u2192 6 elements per row.\n\nThe all-same row is row6 (index6), which is all 0s. The all-same column is column6.\n\nFor each row except row6, take elements 0-5 (before column6). Then, the output will be 12 rows of 6 elements each. But according to the examples, the output rows are (n-1)/2. So perhaps take every other row. For example0's input of 5 rows, output is 2 rows (every other of the 4 non-all-same rows).\n\nTest input has 13 rows. Excluding row6, 12 rows. Take every other row: 6 rows. So rows0,2,4,8,10,12? Or rows0,1,2,3,4,5 and 7,8,9,10,11,12, then take first 6.\n\nAlternatively, take the first (13-1)/2=6 rows above the all-same row and the first 6 rows below.\n\nThe test input's all-same row is row6. The rows above are0-5, rows below are7-12. Take the first 6 rows above (0-5) and first6 rows below (7-12), but there are 6 rows in each.\n\nFor each of these rows, take the first6 elements (columns0-5).\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRows0-5: take columns0-5.\n\nRows7-12: take columns0-5.\n\nThen combine these into 12 rows, but according to the examples, the output should be (n-1)/2=6 rows. So perhaps take the first 6 rows of these.\n\nBut example0's output is the first and last rows of the non-all-same rows. So perhaps the test input's output is the first 6 rows of the non-all-same rows, taking columns0-5.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1] \u2192 elements0-5: [1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1: same as row0.\n\nRow2: same.\n\nRow3: [1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,2,1,1,1,1] \u2192 elements0-5: [1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow4: same as row0.\n\nRow5: same.\n\nRow7: same as row0.\n\nRow8: same.\n\nRow9: same.\n\nRow10: same.\n\nRow11: same.\n\nRow12: same.\n\nSo the first 6 rows (0-5) and rows7-12 (7-12) would be the same. Taking the first 6 rows (rows0-5) and their elements0-5:\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nBut example0's output includes a row with 4, which is from the last row. So perhaps the test output should include rows0-5 and rows7-12's first6 elements, but only the first and last of them.\n\nBut this would not match the examples. Alternatively, the output is the first (n-1)/2 rows above the all-same row and the first (n-1)/2 rows below.\n\nTest input's (n-1)/2=6. So take rows0-5 (6 rows) and rows7-12 (6 rows). Then take their first6 columns. But how to combine them into 6 rows?\n\nAlternatively, the output is the first6 rows of the non-all-same rows, taking their first6 elements.\n\nBut rows0-5 and rows7-12 are 12 rows. Output needs 6 rows. Perhaps take the first3 and last3.\n\nBut example0's output is two rows: first and last.\n\nExample1's output is three rows: first, middle, and last.\n\nExample2's output is five rows: first five rows.\n\nSo for the test input, perhaps the output is the first six rows of the non-all-same rows, taking their first six elements.\n\nBut looking at example0:\n\nNon-all-same rows are0,1,3,4. Output is two rows:0 and4.\n\nExample1's non-all-same rows are0,1,2,4,5,6. Output is three rows:0,1,2.\n\nExample2's non-all-same rows are0-4 and6-10. Output is five rows:0-4.\n\nSo the output seems to be the first (n-1)/2 rows of the non-all-same rows, taking their first (m-1)/2 elements.\n\nFor example0, (5-1)/2=2 rows. Non-all-same rows are0,1,3,4. Take first2 rows:0,1. But example0's output is rows0 and4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative pattern:\n\nThe output is the first (n-1)/2 rows above the all-same row and the first (n-1)/2 rows below, but taking the first (m-1)/2 elements.\n\nFor example0:\n\nAbove: rows0-1 (2 rows), below: rows3-4 (2 rows). Take first2 elements: rows0's [8,8], row1's [8,8], row3's [8,8], row4's [4,8]. Output is two rows: perhaps rows0 and4 \u2192 [8,8], [4,8].\n\nExample1:\n\nAbove: rows0-2 (3 rows), below: rows4-6 (3 rows). Take first3 elements of above \u2192 [4,4,4] each. Take first3 of below \u2192 [4,4,4] each. Output is three rows: above rows0-2's first3 elements. But example1's output is three rows, including [4,1,4] which is from row1's elements4-6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the examples, the test input's output is likely:\n\nThe test input has an all-same row (row6) and all-same column (column6). The output should be the first (13-1)/2=6 rows of the non-all-same rows, taking the first6 elements.\n\nBut the non-all-same rows are rows0-5 and7-12. Taking the first6 rows (rows0-5) and their first6 elements:\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nBut this is six identical rows, which seems unlikely. However, looking at the test input, row3 has a 2 in column8. But when taking the first6 elements (columns0-5), row3's elements are [1,1,1,1,1,1]. So the output would be six rows of six 1s each. But this doesn't match the examples where there were variations.\n\nAh, but in example2, the output included a row with 8 in column1 (third row), which came from the original row's first five elements. In the test input, row3's elements after column6 (which is0) include a 2, but the output is taking the elements before column6, which are all 1s. So the output would be all 1s.\n\nBut in the test input, the output needs to include the row with the 2. However, the 2 in the test input is in column8 of row3. When we take the first6 elements (columns0-5), it's all 1s. So the output would not include the 2. But this seems unlikely. Perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output takes the elements after the all-same column. For example, in the test input, after column6, the elements are [1,1,1,1,1,1] for most rows. But row3's after column6 elements are [1,2,1,1,1,1]. So taking elements7-12 (after column6), but that would include the 2. But according to the examples, the output is formed from elements before the all-same column. So this is conflicting.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to answer, I'll proceed with the following:\n\nThe output is the first (n-1)/2 rows of the non-all-same rows, taking the first (m-1)/2 elements. For the test input, this would be 6 rows of 6 elements each, all 1s except row3's elements after column6, but since we're taking before column6, it's all 1s. However, this might not be correct.\n\nBut looking back at the examples, in example2, the output includes a row with 8 because the original row had that in the first five elements. Similarly, in the test input, row3's first six elements are all 1s, so the output would be all 1s. But the test input's output might have a row with 2, but according to the pattern, the 2 is in column8, which is after the all-same column6, so it's not included.\n\nThus, the final answer would be six rows of six 1s each. But this seems odd. However, looking at the examples, the outputs include variations from the original rows. For example, example0's output includes a 4, which comes from row4's first element. So in the test input, row3's first six elements are all 1s, so the output would have all 1s. Unless there's a mistake in my pattern.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is formed by taking the first and last rows of the non-all-same rows, and their first and last elements before the all-same column. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the answer based on the pattern of taking the first (n-1)/2 rows and first (m-1)/2 elements.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Looking at the training examples.\n\nFirst, in Example 0, the input is a 5x5 grid. The output is two rows: [8,8] and [4,8]. Hmm. The original input has a central row of all 3s. The output rows might be taking parts of the original rows. Let's see. The first output row is [8,8], which matches the first two elements of the first input row. But then the last element in the first input row is 8,8,3,8,8. Wait, maybe they're taking the elements before and after the center element? Wait, the input rows are like [8,8,3,8,8]. The center element is 3. So maybe the output is taking the elements before and after the center, but excluding the center. So for a row length 5, the center is index 2 (0-based). So taking the first two elements and the last two? But in the output for example 0, the first output row is [8,8], which is the first two elements. The second output row is [4,8], which is the first two elements of the fourth row (original input row 4: [4,8,3,8,8]). But why those rows?\n\nWait, the output for Example 0 has two rows. The original input is 5 rows. The output might be selecting the rows that are not the central row. Because the central row in Example 0 is the third row (all 3s), which is excluded. So the output rows are the first, second, fourth, and fifth rows, but then why are there two output rows? Wait, the output has two arrays: [8,8] and [4,8]. Wait, maybe each of those corresponds to the first two elements of certain rows. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [8,8,3,8,8] \u2192 first two are 8,8 \u2192 which is the first output array.\n\nRow 4: [4,8,3,8,8] \u2192 first two are 4,8 \u2192 second output array.\n\nBut why these rows? The central row (row 2) is all 3s, and perhaps the other rows have a 3 in the middle. So maybe the rows that have 3 in the middle are transformed by taking their first two elements. And the rows that are part of the cross (like the central row) are excluded. Wait, but in Example 0, the output has two rows. The input is 5 rows. The output seems to have two rows, each of length 2. So maybe the output is taking the first two elements of the first and last row that are not part of the central cross.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output consists of the rows that are adjacent to the central row, but only parts of them. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1: input is a 7x7 grid. The output is three rows: [4,4,4], [4,1,4], [4,4,4]. The original input has a central row (row 3) which is all 2s. The output rows might be the middle three rows of the original input, excluding the central row. Wait, no. The original input rows are 7 rows. The output has three rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input rows 0,1,2: all start with 4,4,4,2... Then row 3 is all 2s. Rows 4,5,6 are again 4,4,4,2... The output has three arrays: [4,4,4], [4,1,4], [4,4,4]. These correspond to the first three elements of rows 0,1,2, and rows 4,5,6? Wait, the output's first row is [4,4,4], which is the first three elements of row 0. The second output row is [4,1,4], which is elements 0,4,6 of row 1? Wait, no. Original row 1 is [4,4,4,2,4,1,4]. So elements 0,1,2: 4,4,4 \u2192 but the output's second row is [4,1,4]. Wait, that doesn't match. Wait the output's second array is [4,1,4]. Let's check row 1 of the input. Row 1 is [4,4,4,2,4,1,4]. The middle element is 2 (index 3). If we take elements to the left and right of the middle, perhaps? The middle element is 2, which is position 3. So to the left of 2 are 4,4,4, and to the right are 4,1,4. Wait, but the output has [4,1,4], which are the elements after the middle. But the output arrays in Example1 are three elements. So maybe for each row that is not the central row, the elements that are not part of the cross (central row and column) are taken. Wait, perhaps the cross is formed by the central row and the central column. So in Example 0, the central row is row 2 (all 3s), and the central column is column 2 (all 3s). So the cross is the intersection. Then, the output is taking the elements from the rows that are not in the cross, but only the parts outside the cross. \n\nFor example, in Example0, the cross is row 2 (all 3s) and column 2 (all 3s). So for rows that are not the central row, their elements except the central column are taken. But how? Let's take row 0 in Example0: [8,8,3,8,8]. The central column is index 2 (3). So removing that gives [8,8,8,8], but the output is [8,8], which is the first two elements. Hmm, that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps for each row that's not part of the cross (central row), take the elements before and after the central column, but only the part that's not overlapping with the cross. Wait, maybe the cross is both the central row and central column. So any element that is in the central row or central column is part of the cross and is removed. The output consists of the remaining elements, arranged in some way.\n\nLooking at Example0's input:\n\nRows 0,1,3,4 (since row 2 is the central row) and columns 0,1,3,4 (since column 2 is central). The cross elements are row 2 and column 2. So for each row not in the central row, the elements not in the central column. So for row 0: [8,8,8,8] (excluding index 2). But the output is [8,8], which is the first two. Wait, maybe after removing the central column, the elements are split into two parts, left and right. For example, row0 becomes [8,8,8,8], split into [8,8] and [8,8]. Then maybe taking the left part for some rows and the right for others? But in Example0's output, the first line is [8,8], which could be the left part of row0. Then the second output line is [4,8], which is the left part of row4. So maybe for the rows above the central row, take the left part, and for rows below, take the left part again? Not sure. But in Example0's output, the two lines are from rows 0 and 4. So maybe it's taking the first two elements of the first and last row outside the cross.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the elements from the four quadrants formed by the cross. For example, the cross divides the grid into four quadrants. The upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right. Then the output is taking elements from these quadrants. But how?\n\nIn Example1, the output has three arrays, each of three elements. The input is 7x7. The central row and column are at index 3. So the cross is row 3 and column 3. The quadrants would be:\n\nUpper-left (rows 0-2, columns 0-2): 3x3 elements. Upper-right (rows 0-2, columns 4-6). Lower-left (rows 4-6, columns 0-2). Lower-right (rows4-6, columns4-6). The output for Example1 is three arrays, each with three elements. The first array is [4,4,4], which matches the first three elements of row 0 (columns 0-2). The second array is [4,1,4], which is columns 4-6 of row1 (since row1 has [4,4,4,2,4,1,4], columns4-6 are 4,1,4. The third array is [4,4,4], which could be from row4's columns0-2. So the output is combining elements from different quadrants. So the pattern might be that the output is the elements from the quadrants, arranged in a way that for each row in the original input that's not part of the cross, we take the elements from the left and right parts (excluding the central column), and then arrange them in some order.\n\nIn Example1's output:\n\n[4,4,4] \u2192 from row0's left (columns0-2)\n[4,1,4] \u2192 from row1's right (columns4-6)\n[4,4,4] \u2192 from row4's left (columns0-2)\n\nBut how are these selected? Maybe the output is constructed by taking the left part of the upper rows (above the central row) and the right parts of the rows below the central row. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs in the examples:\n\nIn Example0, the output is two rows. The first is [8,8], which corresponds to the first two elements of row0. The second is [4,8], which is the first two elements of row4. So maybe, for each row not in the central row, take the first two elements. But why those rows?\n\nWait, the original input has 5 rows. The central row is row2. The other rows are 0,1,3,4. The output takes the first two elements of rows0 and4. So perhaps only the first and last rows not part of the cross? Or maybe the first and last rows of the non-central rows. But rows0,1,3,4. The first and last of those would be rows0 and4. So the output is taking the first two elements of rows0 and4.\n\nIn Example1, the output has three arrays. The original input has 7 rows. The central row is row3. The non-central rows are 0,1,2,4,5,6. The output arrays are three in number, so maybe the first three rows (0,1,2) and their first three elements (columns0-2), and the last three rows (4,5,6) perhaps taking their right three elements (columns4-6). Wait, the output in Example1 is:\n\n[4,4,4] \u2192 row0's first three\n[4,1,4] \u2192 row1's columns4-6 (4,1,4)\n[4,4,4] \u2192 row4's first three (columns0-2: 4,4,4)\n\nSo that's a mix of left and right parts. Hmm. Not sure. But maybe the pattern is that for each row not in the central row, we take the elements that are not in the central column. Then, split them into left and right parts. For example, in a row of length 5 (as in Example0), removing the central element (index2) leaves four elements. Split into two parts of two elements each: left part (indices0-1) and right part (indices3-4). Then, for each non-central row, take either the left or right part, and arrange them in the output.\n\nIn Example0's output, the first output line is the left part of row0 (8,8), and the second output line is the left part of row4 (4,8). So maybe the output is combining the left parts of the first and last non-central rows. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the parts of the grid that are outside the cross (central row and column). So in Example0, the cross is row2 and column2. The remaining elements are four quadrants. Each quadrant is a 2x2 area. For example, top-left quadrant (rows0-1, columns0-1), top-right (rows0-1, columns3-4), bottom-left (rows3-4, columns0-1), bottom-right (rows3-4, columns3-4). But the output for Example0 has two lines: [8,8] and [4,8]. If these are the top-left and bottom-left quadrants. Then, the output is combining the left quadrants. So the first line would be the first two elements of row0 and row1. But in the output of Example0, it's [8,8] and [4,8], which are from row0 and row4. So maybe the output is taking the left parts of the first and last non-central rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is made by taking for each non-central row, the elements to the left of the central column, and then listing them in the output. So in Example0's row0: elements left of the central column (index2) are 8,8. So [8,8] is taken. Similarly, row4's left elements are 4,8. So the output includes these.\n\nBut why only rows0 and4? Because perhaps they are the first and last rows outside the central cross. But in Example0, there are four non-central rows (0,1,3,4). So why are only two of them included? Maybe because the rows are being split into top and bottom, and for each, only certain parts are taken. For example, take the first two non-central rows from the top and the first two from the bottom. But in Example0's output, only two rows are present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking all the non-central rows and for each, take the elements to the left of the central column. Then, the output is these left parts arranged vertically. But in Example0, that would produce four rows: [8,8], [8,8], [8,8], [4,8]. But the output has only two rows, so this doesn't fit.\n\nLooking at Example2. The input is 11x11. The output has 5 rows. Each output row is of length5. The original input's central row is row5 (all 1s). The output rows are:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3]\n[3,3,3,3,3]\n[3,8,3,3,3]\n[3,3,3,3,3]\n[3,3,3,3,3]\n\nWhich corresponds to the first five elements of rows0,1,2,3,4. But original rows0-4 (excluding row5) are:\n\nRow0: [3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3] \u2192 first five elements: 3,3,3,3,3 \u2192 matches output row0.\n\nRow1: [3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3] \u2192 first five: same.\n\nRow2: [3,8,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3] \u2192 first five: 3,8,3,3,3 \u2192 which is output row2.\n\nSo in Example2's output, the first five rows (rows0-4) are taken, and their first five elements are extracted. But why? Because the cross is row5 and column5. The elements not in the cross would be the elements not in row5 or column5. For each row not in the cross (rows0-4,6-10), the elements not in column5. So for a row in rows0-4, which is not the central row, the elements are all except column5. But each such row in Example2 is 11 elements long, so excluding column5 (index5) would leave 10 elements. But the output rows are 5 elements long. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for each non-cross row, the elements are split into two parts: left of the central column and right of it. Then, the output is taking the left parts of the rows above the central row and the right parts of the rows below. For example, in Example2, the rows above the central row (rows0-4) have their left parts (columns0-4) taken as output rows. And the rows below (rows6-10) have their right parts (columns6-10) taken. But in Example2's output, the rows are the first five elements of rows0-4. So that fits.\n\nSo the pattern could be: for the input grid, split by the central row and central column. For each row not in the central row, if it's above the central row, take the elements to the left of the central column. If it's below, take the elements to the right. Then, concatenate these parts into the output.\n\nLet's test this with Example0.\n\nExample0's input is 5x5. Central row is row2 (index2), central column is index2. Rows above are 0 and 1. Rows below are 3 and4. For rows above (0,1), take elements left of column2 (indices0-1). So for row0: [8,8], row1: [8,8]. For rows below (3,4), take elements right of column2 (indices3-4). So row3: [8,8], row4: [8,8]. But the output of Example0 is two rows: [8,8] and [4,8]. Wait, this doesn't match. Because according to this pattern, the output should have four rows: [8,8], [8,8], [8,8], [8,8]. But the actual output is two rows. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for rows above, take the left part, and for rows below, take the left part again. But in Example0, the output rows are [8,8] (row0) and [4,8] (row4's left part). So that's two rows, but according to the rows above and below, there are two rows above (0,1) and two rows below (3,4). So why only two output rows? Maybe only the first and last rows of each group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first row above the central row and the first row below the central row. So for Example0, rows0 and3. But their left parts would be [8,8] and [8,8]. But the output has [8,8] and [4,8]. Wait, row4 is the last row. So maybe taking the first row above and the last row below. So row0 (above) and row4 (below). Then their left parts: row0's [8,8], row4's left part [4,8]. That matches Example0's output.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1, the output has three rows. The input is 7x7. Central row is row3. Rows above are 0,1,2. Rows below are4,5,6. The output is three rows: first three elements of row0 (left part), row1's right part (columns4-6), and row4's left part (columns0-2). But why those? If the pattern is first row above and last row below, but in Example1, there are three rows above and three below. So maybe for each row in the upper half, take the left part, and for each row in the lower half, take the right part. But in Example1's output:\n\nRow0 (upper): left part [4,4,4]\nRow1 (upper): right part [4,1,4]\nRow4 (lower): left part [4,4,4]\n\nWait, this doesn't follow a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each row not in the central row, take either the left or right part based on their position. For example, upper rows take left parts, lower rows take right parts. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0, upper rows (0,1) take left parts. Lower rows (3,4) take right parts. But in Example0's output, the first output row is row0's left (8,8), and the second is row4's left (4,8). So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the left parts of the upper half and the right parts of the lower half, but only the first and last rows of each. For Example0, upper rows 0 and1: take left parts. Lower rows3 and4: take right parts. But in Example0's output, the two rows are from row0 (upper) and row4 (lower). So row0's left (8,8) and row4's right (8,8). But the output is [8,8] and [4,8], which doesn't match. Because row4's right part is [8,8], but the output has [4,8].\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's recheck:\n\nExample0's input rows:\n\nRow0: [8,8,3,8,8] \u2192 left part (before central column index2) is [8,8], right part (indices3-4) is [8,8].\n\nRow4: [4,8,3,8,8] \u2192 left part [4,8], right part [8,8].\n\nIf the output is taking the left part of the first upper row (row0) and the left part of the first lower row (row3). Row3: [8,8,3,8,8] \u2192 left part [8,8], right part [8,8]. But output is [8,8] and [4,8], which would correspond to row0 and row4's left parts. So this suggests that perhaps the output is formed by taking the left part of the first upper row and the left part of the last lower row.\n\nIn Example0, the first upper row is row0 (left part [8,8]). The last lower row is row4 (left part [4,8]). Thus, the output is these two. Similarly, in Example1, the first upper row is row0 (left part [4,4,4]), the last lower row is row6 (right part [4,4,4]). But Example1's output has three rows. Wait, perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nAnother angle: looking for the positions of the output elements in the input.\n\nIn Example0, output rows are [8,8] and [4,8]. These are the first two elements of the first and last row (excluding central). So maybe the output is the first and last non-central rows' left parts.\n\nIn Example1, the output has three rows. The first is the left part of the first non-central row (row0: [4,4,4]), the second is the right part of row1 (columns4-6: [4,1,4]), and the third is the left part of row4 ([4,4,4]). So perhaps the output combines the left parts of some rows and right parts of others. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example2's output, the output rows are the first five elements of the first five rows (rows0-4). So for each row above the central row, take the left part (columns0-4). So for Example2, since the central row is row5, the rows above are 0-4. Each of these rows has a length of 11. The central column is index5. So the left part would be columns0-4 (5 elements). The output is those 5 elements from each row above. For rows below the central row (rows6-10), perhaps take the right parts (columns6-10) which are 5 elements each, but these are not present in the output. However, in Example2's output, only the rows above are included. So perhaps the pattern is to take the left parts of all rows above the central row. \n\nBut in Example0 and Example1, this doesn't fit. Because in Example0, the rows above the central row are 0 and1, and their left parts would be two elements each. But the output includes only two rows. Example0's output could be the left parts of rows0 and4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern might be that the output consists of the elements that are not part of the cross (central row and central column), arranged by taking the left and right parts of the rows above and below the central row, and combining them in some order.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother thought: the cross is formed by the central row and central column. The output is the elements outside this cross. So for each row not in the central row, remove the central column element. Then, the remaining elements are split into two parts: left and right of the central column. Then, the output is formed by listing the left parts of the rows above the central row, followed by the right parts of the rows below the central row.\n\nLet's test this with Example0:\n\nRows above central row (row2) are rows0 and1. For each of these, remove the central column (index2) \u2192 left parts [8,8] and right parts [8,8]. Then, take the left parts of these rows. So rows0 and1's left parts \u2192 [8,8], [8,8]. Rows below central row (rows3 and4): remove central column \u2192 left parts [8,8] and [4,8], right parts [8,8] and [8,8]. Take the right parts \u2192 [8,8], [8,8]. Then, combine the left parts from above and right parts from below. But the output is [8,8] and [4,8]. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, take the left parts from above and left parts from below. So rows0 and1's left \u2192 [8,8], [8,8]. Rows3 and4's left \u2192 [8,8], [4,8]. Combine all \u2192 four rows. But Example0's output has two. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the left parts of the first row above and the left part of the last row below. For Example0, row0's left [8,8] and row4's left [4,8]. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example1, rows above central are 0,1,2. Take row0's left [4,4,4], row2's left [4,4,4]. Rows below are4,5,6. Take row6's right [4,4,4]. But the output includes [4,4,4], [4,1,4], [4,4,4]. Which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the left parts of all the rows above the central row and the right parts of all the rows below the central row, but only if they are the first and last of each group. \n\nBut in Example1's output, there are three rows. So perhaps the number of output rows is equal to the number of rows above the central row.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the left parts of the rows above the central row, and the right parts of the rows below. So for Example0:\n\nRows above: 0 and1 \u2192 left parts [8,8], [8,8] \u2192 output first two rows.\n\nRows below:3 and4 \u2192 right parts [8,8], [8,8] \u2192 output next two rows. But Example0's output has only two rows, not four. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's try to find another pattern. Looking at the outputs:\n\nExample0's output has two rows. Each row is the first two elements of the corresponding input row. But which rows? It's row0 and row4.\n\nExample1's output has three rows. Each is first three elements of row0, elements 4-6 of row1, and first three of row4.\n\nExample2's output has five rows. Each is first five elements of rows0-4.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that the output is composed of the elements from the rows not in the central row, and for each such row, we take a segment that starts from the beginning and has a length equal to the number of rows above (for rows above the central row) and number of rows below (for rows below). \n\nWait, in Example0, there are two rows above and two rows below. The output has two rows. For rows above, take the first two elements. For rows below, take the first two elements. But row4's first two are 4,8.\n\nExample1 has three rows above and three below. The output has three rows. For rows above, take the first three elements (row0: 4,4,4), and row1's elements 4-6 (4,1,4) which is three elements, and row4's first three (4,4,4). So maybe the output is taking the first three elements of rows0, row1's middle three elements (since row1 is in the middle of the upper rows?), and row4's first three.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the elements from each non-central row that are in the same positions as the row's distance from the central row. For example, in Example0, row0 is two rows above central. So take the first two elements. Row4 is two rows below, so take the first two elements. That fits Example0. \n\nExample1's rows above are three rows (0,1,2) and below are three rows (4,5,6). For row0 (distance 3 above), take first three elements. Row1 (distance 2 above), take first two elements. But no, Example1's output has a row with three elements. So this may not fit.\n\nWait, Example1's output row1 is [4,1,4], which is three elements. So perhaps for each row, the number of elements taken is equal to the number of rows above or below. In Example1, three rows above, so take three elements. For row0, take first three. For row1, take elements around the middle. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of elements taken in each row is equal to the floor of (row length - 1)/2. For Example0, row length 5. (5-1)/2 = 2. So take two elements. Which fits. Example1, row length 7. (7-1)/2=3. Take three elements. Example2, row length11. (11-1)/2=5. Take five elements. So this seems to fit. So the number of elements taken per row is (n-1)/2, where n is the length of the row. For example, in Example0, each output row has two elements. Which matches (5-1)/2=2.\n\nSo for each non-central row, take the first k elements, where k=(n-1)/2. But why the first k? Or perhaps the left half of the row excluding the central column.\n\nFor example, row length 5. Excluding central column (index2), left part is indices0-1 (2 elements). So take that.\n\nRow length7: left part indices0-2 (3 elements).\n\nRow length11: left part indices0-4 (5 elements).\n\nSo the output for each non-central row is the left part (up to the central column). So for rows above the central row, take the left part. For rows below the central row, also take the left part. \n\nBut in Example0's output, the rows are from row0 (left part [8,8]) and row4 (left part [4,8]). So why not rows1 and3 as well? Because Example0's output has two rows, but there are four non-central rows.\n\nAh! Wait, looking back at the training examples, maybe the output is not including all non-central rows but only those that are mirrored across the central row. For example, in Example0, row0 and row4 are mirrored. Similarly, row1 and row3 are mirrored. So the output takes the left part of row0 and row4, which are the first and last non-central rows. Similarly, in Example1, the output includes row0, row1, and row4. Row0 and row6 are mirrored, row1 and row5 are mirrored, row2 and row4 are mirrored. But why those rows are chosen?\n\nAlternatively, the output includes only the first (n-1)/2 rows above and the first (n-1)/2 rows below. For Example0, n=5 rows. (5-1)/2=2. So take two rows above and two below. But the output has two rows total. So maybe it takes the first row above and the first row below. Or first row above and last row below.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to see if there's a simpler pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input is a 13x13 grid. The central row is row6 (all 0s). The central column is index6. The non-central rows are 0-5 and7-12. The output should be the left parts of the first (n-1)/2 rows above and the left parts of the first (n-1)/2 rows below. For row length13, (13-1)/2=6. So take left parts of 6 elements (columns0-5). \n\nBut in the test input, let's look at the rows:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1] \u2192 left part (indices0-5) \u2192 [1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1: same as row0.\n\nRow2: same.\n\nRow3: [1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,2,1,1,1,1] \u2192 left part [1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow4: same as row0.\n\nRow5: same.\n\nRow7: same as row0.\n\nRow8: same.\n\nRow9: same.\n\nRow10: same.\n\nRow11: same.\n\nRow12: same.\n\nBut the output would need to follow the pattern of the training examples. Looking at Example2, where the output was the left parts of the first five rows above the central row. So for the test input, perhaps the output will be the left parts of the first six rows above the central row (rows0-5), but only taking the first six elements (columns0-5) of each. However, the test input's rows0-5 have the same left part except row3, which has a 2 in position8, but the left part is indices0-5 (all 1s). So the output would be six rows of [1,1,1,1,1,1], but the test input has a row3 (row3 in the input is row3 in the test input) where the left part is all 1s. But in the test input's row3, the 2 is in index8, which is part of the right part.\n\nWait, but looking at the test input's row3: [1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,2,1,1,1,1]. The central column is index6. The left part is indices0-5: [1,1,1,1,1,1]. The right part is indices7-12: [1,2,1,1,1,1]. So the output would have left parts of rows0-5 (all [1,1,1,1,1,1]) and right parts of rows7-12 (all [1,1,1,1,1,1] except row3's right part includes a 2. But in the training examples, the outputs included variations. For instance, in Example1, the output had a row with a 1 in the middle. Looking at the test input, perhaps the output will include the left parts of rows0-5 and the right parts of rows7-12. But since row3's right part (but row3 is in the upper half) has a 2, but it's in the lower half's right parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output includes only the left parts of the upper rows and the left parts of the lower rows, but the lower rows are from the test input's rows7-12. But their left parts are indices0-5, which are all 1s. So the output would be six rows of [1,1,1,1,1,1] from the upper part and six rows from the lower part, but that's 12 rows, which doesn't match the training examples. \n\nAlternatively, the output is only the left parts of the upper rows. For the test input, rows0-5: left parts are six elements each. So output would be six rows of six 1s. But looking at the training examples:\n\nIn Example0, output is two rows of two elements each.\n\nExample1: three rows of three elements.\n\nExample2: five rows of five elements.\n\nSo the number of output rows is equal to the number of rows above the central row. For Example0, two rows above \u2192 output two rows. Example1, three rows above \u2192 three output rows. Example2, five rows above \u2192 five output rows. So for the test input, which has six rows above the central row (rows0-5), the output would be six rows, each containing six elements (the left parts of those rows).\n\nBut looking at the test input's rows0-5:\n\nRow0: left part [1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1: same.\n\nRow2: same.\n\nRow3: left part [1,1,1,1,1,1] (even though row3 has a 2 in index8, which is in the right part).\n\nRow4: same as row0.\n\nRow5: same.\n\nSo the output would be six rows of [1,1,1,1,1,1]. But this doesn't account for the 2 in row3. However, in the test input, the 2 is in column8 (right part) of row3. So since we're taking the left part (columns0-5), the 2 wouldn't be included. But why is this the case?\n\nBut wait, looking at the training examples, for Example1, there's a 1 in the output. Let's see: in Example1's input, row1 is [4,4,4,2,4,1,4]. The left part (columns0-2) is [4,4,4], but the output's second row is [4,1,4]. So this contradicts the previous pattern.\n\nWait, this suggests that the pattern isn't just taking the left parts of the upper rows. Because in Example1's output, the second row is [4,1,4], which is the right part of row1 (columns4-6).\n\nHmm. This indicates that the pattern is different.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the output is the elements that are not part of the cross (central row and column), arranged in a specific way. For each non-central row, split into two parts at the central column, then concatenate all the left parts of the upper rows followed by all the right parts of the lower rows.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nUpper rows0-1: left parts [8,8] each \u2192 two rows.\n\nLower rows3-4: right parts [8,8] each \u2192 two rows. \n\nBut Example0's output is two rows. So perhaps only the first upper and first lower. Or the first and last.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let me try to see what's common in the training examples.\n\nIn each example, the output consists of the non-central rows, and for each of those rows, a certain number of elements are taken from the left and/or right of the central column.\n\nFor example, in Example2, the output is the first five elements of the upper five rows. This suggests that for rows above the central row, take the elements to the left of the central column. For rows below, perhaps take the right parts. But Example2's output doesn't include the lower rows. So maybe the pattern is that the output is the elements from the rows above the central row, taking the left parts, and the rows below, taking the right parts. But in Example0 and 1, the outputs include both upper and lower rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the elements from the upper rows' left parts and lower rows' right parts, merged into a single list.\n\nBut in Example0:\n\nUpper rows0-1: left parts [8,8], [8,8]\n\nLower rows3-4: right parts [8,8], [8,8]\n\nOutput would be four rows, but the actual output is two rows. So perhaps only the first upper and last lower.\n\nBut why? In Example0's output, the two rows are from row0 and row4. So first upper and last lower.\n\nSimilarly, Example1's output:\n\nUpper rows0-2: left parts [4,4,4], [4,4,4], [4,4,4]\n\nLower rows4-6: right parts [4,4,4], [4,4,4], [4,4,4]\n\nBut Example1's output has three rows: [4,4,4], [4,1,4], [4,4,4]. The middle row [4,1,4] is from row1's right part. So this suggests that maybe some rows are taken from the right parts of the upper rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the left parts of the upper rows and the right parts of the lower rows, but only for the rows that have a certain property, like having a different element in their right part.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking all the elements that are not in the cross, and then arranging them row-wise, but only taking the left and right parts. For example, in a grid, the non-cross elements form two parts on each side of the cross. The output lists the elements from the left part of the upper rows and the right part of the lower rows, concatenated.\n\nBut how to arrange them into rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the left parts of the upper non-central rows and the left parts of the lower non-central rows, arranged in order. So for Example0, upper non-central rows0-1 have left parts [8,8], [8,8]. Lower non-central rows3-4 have left parts [8,8], [4,8]. The output has two rows: first from row0 and last from row4. So perhaps the output is the left parts of the first upper row and the left part of the last lower row.\n\nIn Example0: row0 and row4 \u2192 [8,8], [4,8].\n\nIn Example1: row0 and row6 \u2192 [4,4,4], [4,4,4]. But Example1's output has three rows, so this doesn't fit.\n\nBut Example1's output has three rows. The first is row0's left, the second is row1's right part (columns4-6: [4,1,4]), the third is row4's left part. So maybe the pattern is alternating upper and lower rows. But it's unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, perhaps the pattern is that for each non-central row, the output takes the elements to the left of the central column. Then, the output is these left parts for the rows above the central row, and the left parts for the rows below the central row. However, in Example0, this would result in four rows (0,1,3,4), each with two elements, but the output only has two rows. So this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the left parts of the rows above and the left parts of the rows below, but only the first and last of each group. So for Example0, first upper (row0) and last lower (row4). \n\nIn the test input, which has six rows above and six below, the output would be six rows from the upper part (left parts) and six from the lower (left parts). But since the test input's rows0-5 are all 1s in the left parts, the output would be six rows of six 1s. However, looking at the test input's row3 (which is in the upper part), there's a 2 in the right part (index8), but the left part is all 1s. So the output would not include that 2.\n\nBut in the test input's row3, the input is [1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,2,1,1,1,1]. The left part is indices0-5: six 1s. The right part is indices7-12: [1,2,1,1,1,1]. But according to this pattern, the output would include only the left parts. So the 2 in the right part wouldn't be in the output.\n\nBut in Example1's output, there's a 1 in the second row. That comes from row1's right part. So this contradicts the pattern.\n\nAnother possibility: the output includes the left parts of the upper rows and the right parts of the lower rows. For Example0:\n\nUpper rows0-1: left parts [8,8] each.\n\nLower rows3-4: right parts [8,8] each.\n\nOutput would be four rows. But Example0's output is two. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the left parts of the upper rows and the right parts of the lower rows, but merged into a single list. For Example0:\n\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8] \u2192 arranged as two rows of two elements each. But Example0's output is two rows of two elements each. So this could fit. But why arranged that way?\n\nAlternatively, the output is the elements outside the cross, ordered row-wise, and split into rows of length k, where k is (n-1)/2. For Example0, n=5, k=2. So each row in the output has two elements. The total elements outside the cross are 4 rows *4 elements each (since each non-central row has 4 elements after removing the central column), but 4*4=16 elements. Split into rows of 2 \u2192 8 rows. Which doesn't match Example0's output of two rows.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given time constraints, I'll make a guess based on the observation that in each example, the output rows are the left parts (elements before the central column) of the upper rows and the left parts of the lower rows, taking the first and last of each. For the test input, which has six upper rows and six lower rows, the output would be six upper rows' left parts (six 1s each) and six lower rows' left parts (six 1s each), but the test input's lower rows are rows7-12, which have left parts [1,1,1,1,1,1] each. However, according to Example2, the output only includes the upper rows. Example2's output includes the upper five rows' left parts (five rows of five elements each). So perhaps the pattern is that the output is the left parts of all the upper rows. So for the test input, the output would be six rows, each being the first six elements of rows0-5. All of which are [1,1,1,1,1,1]. But this doesn't account for row3's right part having a 2. However, since it's the left part that's taken, the 2 isn't included.\n\nBut in Example1, the output includes a row from the lower rows (row4). So this contradicts. But maybe in Example1, the output includes the upper rows and some lower rows. It's possible that the pattern is to take the left parts of all non-central rows. For Example0, four non-central rows, each contributing two elements. So output would be four rows of two elements. But Example0's output has two rows. So this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the left parts of the rows above the central row and the right parts of the rows below. For Example0, two rows above \u2192 two rows of two elements, and two rows below \u2192 two rows of two elements, total four rows. But the output has two. So no.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the output is the left parts of the rows above the central row. For Example0, two rows above, each with two elements. Example1, three rows above, each with three elements. Example2, five rows above, each with five elements. Test input, six rows above, each with six elements. \n\nBut in Example1's output, there's a row [4,1,4], which is from the right part of a row. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example2's output, the rows are the left parts of the upper five rows. Which fits.\n\nSo for the test input, the output would be the left parts of the first six rows (rows0-5), each taking the first six elements. So six rows of six 1s each. But in the test input's row3, there's a 2 in column8 (right part), which isn't included.\n\nBut according to Example1, the output can include a row from a lower row. So maybe the pattern is that the output is the left parts of the upper rows and the right parts of the lower rows.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nUpper rows0-5: left parts \u2192 six elements each of 1s.\n\nLower rows7-12: right parts \u2192 each row's elements from column7-12.\n\nFor example, row7's right part is columns7-12: [0,1,1,1,1,1,1] \u2192 wait, no. Row7 is [1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]. The central column is index6 (value 0). The right part is indices7-12: [1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nSo for each lower row, the right part is six elements. So the output would be six upper rows (left parts) and six lower rows (right parts), totaling twelve rows. But the training examples don't show this. For example, Example0's output has two rows from upper and lower.\n\nBut in Example1's output, three rows: upper rows' left parts and a lower row's left part. \n\nThis is really confusing. Given time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the output for the test case is the left parts of the upper rows. So six rows of six 1s each. \n\nBut looking back at Example1's output, which includes a row from a lower row. So this approach might be wrong. Alternatively, the output is the left parts of all non-central rows. For the test input, this would be twelve rows. But the training examples have fewer rows. So this is unlikely.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output consists of the rows that are not part of the central row, but with the central column element removed. Then, the remaining elements are split into left and right parts. The output is formed by taking the left parts of the upper rows and the right parts of the lower rows. \n\nFor Example0, upper rows0-1: left parts [8,8] each. Lower rows3-4: right parts [8,8] each. Output would be four rows. But Example0's output is two rows. So maybe only the first upper and first lower.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the left parts of the upper rows and the right parts of the lower rows, but only the first and last rows of each. For Example0: row0's left and row4's right. Row0's left is [8,8], row4's right is [8,8]. But Example0's output is [8,8] and [4,8], which is row4's left. So no.\n\nIn conclusion, given the time I've spent and the need to answer, I'll proceed with the following:\n\nThe output for the test case is the left parts of the first six rows (rows0-5), each of which is [1,1,1,1,1,1]. So the output would be six such rows. But looking at the training examples, the output is formatted with each array on a separate line. So the answer would be six lines of [1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\nBut wait, in the test input's row3, there's a 2 in the right part, but in the left part it's all 1s. So the output would not include the 2. But in Example1's output, the second row is [4,1,4], which comes from the right part of row1. So this suggests that the pattern is more complex. \n\nBut given the time constraints and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output is the left parts of the upper rows. So for the test input, six rows of six 1s each. However, looking at the training examples, in Example1, the output includes a row from the upper rows and a row from the lower rows. So this approach may be incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output includes all non-central rows, but with the central column removed and split into left and right parts, then the output is left parts followed by right parts. For Example0, four rows, two elements each. Output two rows of two elements each. So two rows from left parts and two from right. But Example0's output has two rows. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAfter extensive consideration, the most plausible pattern is that the output includes the left parts of the upper rows and the right parts of the lower rows. For the test input:\n\nUpper rows0-5: left parts \u2192 six 1s each. Six rows.\n\nLower rows7-12: right parts \u2192 six 1s each. Six rows.\n\nBut this would make twelve rows. But the training examples don't have this. Example0's output has two rows, which would be two upper rows and two lower rows. But it only has two rows.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the following approach for the test case:\n\nThe output is the left parts of the upper rows and the right parts of the lower rows, each contributing a certain number of rows. For the test input, since the central row is row6, the upper rows are0-5 (six rows), and the lower rows are7-12 (six rows). For each upper row, take the left part (six elements), and for each lower row, take the right part (six elements). The output would be six rows of six 1s from the upper part and six rows of six 1s from the lower part. But this is twelve rows, which doesn't match the training examples' format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output includes only the upper rows' left parts. For the test input, six rows of six 1s each. This matches Example2's pattern. But in Example1, the output includes rows from both upper and lower.\n\nGiven the conflicting evidence, I'll proceed with the assumption that the output includes the left parts of the upper non-central rows. So for the test input:\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nBut how does this align with the training examples?\n\nExample0 has two upper rows (0,1) \u2192 output two rows.\n\nExample1 has three upper rows (0,1,2) \u2192 output three rows.\n\nExample2 has five upper rows (0-4) \u2192 output five rows.\n\nThus, for the test input with six upper rows, the output would be six rows.\n\nBut in the test input's row3, there's a 2 in the right part, but the left part is all 1s. So the output would not show the 2. However, in Example1, the output includes a row from the lower rows (row4) and a row from the upper rows (row1's right part). So this suggests that my hypothesis is incorrect. But given time constraints, I'll proceed with this answer.",
