        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is transformed into an output by modifying certain elements. Let me start by analyzing the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has several 8s and 1s, with some 3s and 2s. The output seems to have replaced some 1s with 2s. For instance, in the second row of the input, there's a sequence of 1s, and in the output, the fifth element is a 2. Similarly, other rows have 2s introduced where there were 1s before. Also, there are 3s around some 2s. It looks like whenever there's a 3 in the input, it's surrounded by certain numbers in the output. Maybe there's a replacement rule where a certain value is replaced with another based on its neighbors or position.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has 1s, 2s, and a 4. The output replaces some 2s with 3s and a 4 with 3s and 4. For example, in the fifth row of input, there's a 4 in the middle of 3s, and in the output, that 4 is still there but surrounded by 3s. Also, some 2s are replaced by 3s. It seems like higher numbers are acting as some sort of markers, and adjacent numbers are being changed based on them.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 3s, 4, 5, 6. The output introduces 5s and 6s around the 4. For instance, the 4 in the input's 6th row becomes surrounded by 5 and 6 in the output. Also, there's a pattern where a 3 followed by a 4 might turn into a 5 and 6 around it. \n\nPutting this together, it looks like the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with their neighbors. Specifically, when there's a number that's one less than another (like 3 and 4), the lower number is replaced with the higher one's value minus one, or maybe creating a gradient. Alternatively, maybe it's a cellular automaton-like rule where each cell looks at its neighbors and updates based on certain conditions.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output seems to create a sort of 'border' around certain higher numbers. For example, in Example 0, wherever there's a 3 in the input, the output has 2s and 3s around it. Similarly, in Example 2, the 4 is surrounded by 5 and 6. This suggests that higher numbers are acting as centers, and adjacent cells are being updated to form a gradient or a path leading to them.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input, in the fifth row, there's a 3 in the input's fifth position, and the output has 2s around it. Similarly, in Example 1, the 4 in the input is surrounded by 3s in the output. So maybe the rule is that when a cell has a number higher than its neighbors (by 1?), those neighbors are replaced with the next lower number. For example, a 3 would cause adjacent 1s to become 2s. Then, a 4 would cause adjacent 2s to become 3s, and so on. But this needs to be verified.\n\nAlternatively, it could be that each number is being replaced by the next higher number in the output if it's adjacent to a higher number. But how does that fit with the examples? Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the fifth row has a 3, and in the output, the cells around it become 2 and 3. Wait, maybe the 3 is a center, and surrounding cells are set to 2. Then, if there's a 2, surrounding cells become 1. But the output in Example 0's fifth row shows 2,2,3,2,2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the positions where changes occur. In Example 0, the input has a 3 in the fifth row, sixth element. The output's fifth row has a 3 replaced by 2, but adjacent to that are 2s. Wait, maybe the 3 in the input is replaced by 2 in the output, and the surrounding cells become 3. But that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is to replace the cell with the next lower number if it's adjacent to a higher number. For example, if a cell is next to a 3, it becomes 2. But in Example 0's fifth input row, the 3 is in position 5, and the output row has 2s around it. So maybe cells adjacent to 3 are turned into 2. Then, cells adjacent to 2 would be turned into 1. But how does that explain other parts of the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each occurrence of a number N in the input is replaced by N-1 in the output, except when surrounded by certain higher numbers. But in Example 0, the 8s remain the same. So the 8s are probably borders and not changed. The 1s in certain positions become 2s. The 3s in the input become 2s in the output, but in Example 0's output, there are 3s as well. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, looking at the input of Example 0, in the fifth row, the input has 3, and the output has 2s around it. Wait, maybe the 3 is replaced by 2, and the surrounding cells are 3. Let's check:\n\nInput row 5 (0-indexed? Not sure how the rows are counted, but assuming each line is a row):\n\nOriginal input row 5 (from example 0's input):\n[8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 8, 8]\n\nWait, no. Wait the input for example 0 is a list of rows. Let me check again.\n\nWait the first example's input has rows like:\n\nLooking at the input for example 0, the fifth row (assuming each line is a row) is:\n\n[8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8]\n\nWait maybe I need to look at the output's fifth row. The output's fifth row for example 0 is:\n\n[8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n\nHmm, so the 3 in the input's fifth row (position 24) becomes a 3 in the output's fifth row? Or perhaps the 3 is replaced by 2, but adjacent cells are changed. Maybe the rule is that whenever there's a number higher than 1 (like 2 or 3), it propagates its value minus 1 to adjacent cells. For example, a 3 would turn adjacent cells into 2, and a 2 would turn adjacent cells into 1. But this needs to be checked.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the row with 4 in the input has adjacent 3s in the output. So maybe a 4 turns adjacent cells into 3, and a 3 turns adjacent into 2, etc. So each higher number propagates its value minus one to adjacent cells.\n\nBut how does that work in Example 0? The input has a 3 in some positions. In the output, the cells around that 3 become 2. Then, the 2s would propagate 1s. But in the output, the 2s are in a line, which might be forming a path towards the 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each number N in the input is replaced by N-1, except when surrounded by higher numbers, in which case it's replaced by N. But that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, another angle: looking at the output for Example 0, the 3 in the input's fifth row (position 25) is now part of a sequence of 2s. Wait, maybe the 3 is being replaced by 2, and surrounding cells are adjusted. Or perhaps the 3 is the center, and a cross-shaped area around it is set to 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is creating a diamond or cross pattern around the higher numbers. For example, in Example 0, a 3 in the input leads to a diamond of 2s around it in the output.\n\nBut let's look at the positions. For instance, in Example 0's input, there's a 3 in the fifth row's position 25 (assuming 0-based or 1-based index). The output's fifth row has a sequence of 2s. Wait, perhaps the rule is that each cell becomes the minimum of its neighbors plus one, or something similar to a distance transform.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is creating a \"distance\" map where each cell is the distance (in some metric) from the nearest higher number. For example, in Example 0, the 3s in the input would be the source, and the surrounding cells are assigned 2, then 1, etc. But in the output of Example 0, the cells around the 3 are 2, which would be distance 1. Then the next layer would be 1, but in the output, there are 1s further out. Hmm, but the 3 in the input's fifth row is at position 25, and in the output, the fifth row is filled with 2s. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that whenever a number N appears in the input, all the cells in the same row or column as N are replaced with N-1. For example, a 3 in a row would turn all 1s in that row into 2s. But in Example 0, the rows with 3s have more 2s in the output. Let's check. For example, in Example 0's input, the fifth row has a 3. The output's fifth row has many 2s. But also, other rows without 3s have 2s. Hmm, that might not hold.\n\nAnother approach: compare each input row to its output row. For example, in Example 0's input row 1:\n\nInput row 1: [8,8,1,...1,8,8...]\nOutput row 1: [8,8,1,1,1,2,1,...8]\n\nAh, here the sixth element (index 5?) is changed from 1 to 2. Looking at other rows, perhaps whenever there's a 3 in the input, the cell two positions to the left becomes 2. Or maybe there's a vertical alignment. Wait, maybe the 3 in the input's fifth row (original input) is causing certain positions in the same column in other rows to become 2.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that each cell in the output is the maximum of its neighbors in the input. But that might not explain the 2s.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input, the fifth row has a 4 in the middle of 3s. The output's fifth row has a 4 surrounded by 3s and 3s replaced by 4's. Wait, no. In the input's fifth row, the 4 is part of a sequence of 3s. The output's fifth row changes the 4 to 3, but that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is replacing certain values based on their position relative to the higher numbers. For example, any 1 that is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a 3 in the input becomes a 2 in the output. Similarly, 2s adjacent to a 3 become 3s. But this might create a ripple effect.\n\nTesting this hypothesis: In Example 0's input, the third row has a 3 at position 25 (assuming rows are 0-indexed). The output's third row has 2s around that position. So if a 3 is present, adjacent cells (left, right, up, down) become 2. Then, those 2s would cause their adjacent cells to become 1? But in Example 0's output, there are many 2s, which suggests that maybe only the immediate neighbors of 3s become 2s, and other 1s remain 1.\n\nBut looking at Example 0's output, the fifth row is filled with 2s. The input's fifth row has a 3, but the output's fifth row is all 2s except for the 3. Wait, no. Wait the input's fifth row in Example 0 is:\n\n[8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 8, 8]\n\nWait, no, the input's fifth row in Example 0's input (from the user's message) is:\n\nWait the user provided the input for Example 0 as a series of lists. Let me parse that correctly.\n\nLooking back:\n\nIn Example 0's INPUT:\n\nThe rows are:\n\nRow 0: all 8s.\n\nRow 1: starts with 8,8, then 1s, then 8s.\n\nRow 2: has a 3 in position 25 (assuming 0-based index 25?), output row 2 has a 2 in that position? Or maybe the 3 is replaced by 2, and adjacent cells are modified.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that whenever there's a number N (like 3), it's replaced by N-1 (2), and the cells around it are set to N-1 as well. But this might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be that the highest number in each local area is reduced by one, and surrounding cells are set to that value. For example, a 3 becomes 2, and surrounding cells become 2. Then, in the next step, those 2s become 1s, etc. But how does this apply across the examples?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the test input. The test input has 4s and 1s, with a 2 and a 3 in later rows. Applying the pattern from the examples, maybe the 2 and 3 in the test input will influence surrounding cells. For instance, the 3 in the test input's row 23 (assuming rows are 0-indexed) might cause surrounding cells to become 2, and the 2 in row 9 might cause surrounding cells to become 1.\n\nBut I need to find a consistent rule. Let's look for patterns in the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput has 8s as borders. The inner region is 1s, with some 3s and 2s. The output replaces certain 1s with 2s, especially around the 3s. For example, in the input's fifth row, where there's a 3, the output has a line of 2s. It looks like the 3 is replaced by 2, and the cells around it are also 2. Then, in the output's fifth row, there's a sequence of 2s. Also, in the output's fifth row, the original 3 is now a 2, and the surrounding cells are 2s. Wait, no. The input's fifth row has a 3 in position 25 (assuming each row is 30 elements), and the output's fifth row is:\n\n[8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n\nSo the 3 is replaced by 3, but the surrounding cells are 2s. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the 3 in the input is part of a cross-shaped pattern, and in the output, the cross is filled with 2s. For example, the cell with 3 in the input has its row and column filled with 2s in the output. But in the output's fifth row, the entire row is 2s except for the 3. So perhaps the 3 acts as a horizontal line, turning all cells in that row (except borders) to 2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that any row containing a 3 has all its 1s replaced with 2s. But in Example 0's input, the fifth row has a 3 and the output's fifth row has all 2s. Similarly, other rows with 3s in the input have their 1s turned into 2s. But looking at other rows, like the fourth row in the input has a 3, and the output's fourth row has 3s and 2s. Wait, maybe it's not that straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that whenever there's a 3 in the input, the cell itself becomes 2, and the cells immediately to the left and right become 2 as well. But that doesn't explain the entire row being 2s.\n\nWait, looking at the output of Example 0's fifth row, all the 1s are replaced by 2s, and the 3 is replaced by 3. That suggests that whenever a row contains a 3, all 1s in that row are replaced by 2s. Similarly, in Example 1, rows with 4s have their 2s replaced by 3s. But in Example 1's input, the fifth row has a 4, and the output's fifth row has 3s replacing 2s. So maybe the rule is: in any row that contains a number N, replace all occurrences of (N-1) with (N-1) and others with N-2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, find the maximum number in that row, then replace all numbers lower than that maximum with (maximum - 1). For example, in Example 0's fifth row, the maximum is 3 (from the input), so all 1s become 2. But the 3 remains 3. But in the output's fifth row, the 3 is replaced by 3, but the rest are 2s. That could fit. Then, in Example 1's fifth row, the maximum is 4, so all 2s (4-2=2) become 3 (4-1=3). The 4 remains 4. But in Example 1's output fifth row, the 4 is replaced by 4, and the 2s become 3. That seems to fit. \n\nTesting this hypothesis:\n\nIn Example 0's input row 5, the maximum is 3. All numbers lower than 3 (1s and 2s) are replaced by 3-1=2. So 1s and 2s become 2. But the 3 remains 3. Looking at the output, that row becomes all 2s except the 3. That fits.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 5, the maximum is 4. All lower numbers (2s, 3s) are replaced by 4-1=3. So 2s become 3, 3s become 3, and the 4 remains 4. The output row 5 has 3s and a 4. That matches.\n\nIn Example 2's input, row 6 has a 4. The maximum is 4. So lower numbers (3s) become 3. But in the output, the 4 is surrounded by 5 and 6. Wait, this doesn't fit. So maybe this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that each cell is replaced by the maximum value in its row minus 1, unless it's the maximum itself. So, for example, in a row with max 3, each cell becomes 2 unless it's 3. But Example 2's row 6 has a 4, so other cells would become 3, but in the output, there are 5 and 6. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps each cell is increased by 1 if it's adjacent to a higher number. For example, a 1 next to a 3 becomes 2, a 2 next to a 3 becomes 3, etc. But in Example 0's output, the 3 is surrounded by 2s, which are lower, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace each occurrence of a number N with N+1 if it's adjacent to a number higher than N. Otherwise, leave it as is. For example, a 1 next to a 3 would become 2. A 2 next to a 3 would become 3. But in Example 0's input row 5, the 3 is next to 2s and 1s, which would become 3 and 2. But the output row has 2s. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input row 5: the 3 is at position 25. The cells around it in the input are 2s and 1s. In the output, those cells are 2s. If the rule is that any cell adjacent to a higher number becomes that higher number minus 1, then cells next to 3 would become 2. Cells next to 2 would become 1. But in the output, the entire row is 2s except the 3. So maybe the 3 is part of a vertical line, and all cells in that row except the borders are replaced by 2.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to replace all instances of a certain number in a row with another number, based on the presence of a higher number elsewhere in the row. For example, if a row contains a 3, all 1s become 2s. If a row contains a 4, all 2s become 3s, etc. This could explain Example 0 and Example 1.\n\nIn Example 0's input, rows with 3 have their 1s replaced with 2s. Rows without 3 keep 1s. Similarly, in Example 1's input, rows with 4 have their 2s replaced with 3s. Rows with 3s have their 1s replaced with 2s. But in Example 2's input, rows with 4 have 3s replaced with higher numbers. This might not fit.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input row 6:\n\nInput row 6: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8]\n\nOutput row 6: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8]\n\nWait, the 4 in the input is replaced by 5 in the output. The surrounding 3s are replaced by 5 as well. So maybe the rule is that a number N is replaced by N+1 if it's next to a higher number. But the 4 is next to 3s, so why is it replaced by 5?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Perhaps another approach: look for the transformation between input and output in each example and find a common rule.\n\nExample 0: Replaces 1s with 2s in rows where there's a 3, and replaces 3s with 2s, but also introduces 3s around them. Not sure.\n\nExample 1: Replaces 2s with 3s in rows with a 4, and replaces 4 with 3s around it. But the 4 remains.\n\nExample 2: Replaces 3s with 5 and 6 around the 4.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each number N is replaced by N+1 in the output, but only if there's a higher number adjacent to it in the input. For example, a 3 next to a 4 would become 4. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, it's a diagonal replacement. For example, in Example 0, the 3 in the input's fifth row creates a vertical line of 2s in the output. In Example 2, the 4 creates a vertical line of 5s and 6s.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a mirror or a shift of the input. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output seems to have certain 'paths' or 'lines' where numbers increase towards a higher number. Like in Example 2's output, there's a vertical line of 5s leading to the 4, which is replaced by 5 and 6. Maybe the higher numbers act as attractors, and the path to them is marked with increasing numbers.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's think about the test input.\n\nTest input has a lot of 4s. There's a 2 in row 9, column 6 (assuming rows are 0-indexed). There's a 3 in row 23, column 18. The rest are mostly 1s and 4s.\n\nApplying the pattern from the examples, if the rule is that in any row containing a number N, all instances of N-1 are replaced by N-2, then:\n\nIn rows with a 4, replace 3s with 2s. But the test input has 4s in the borders and 1s and some 2 and 3 inside.\n\nAlternatively, if a row contains a 2, then all 1s become 2s. If a row contains a 3, all 2s become 3s. If a row contains a 4, all 3s become 4s, etc.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input: rows with 3 have 1s replaced by 2s.\n\nExample 1's input: rows with 4 have 2s replaced by 3s.\n\nExample 2's input: rows with 4 have 3s replaced by 5 and 6. Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the rule is that for each cell, if there's a number N in the same row or column, the cell becomes N-1.\n\nFor example, in a row with a 3, all cells become 2. But in Example 0's fifth row, the output is all 2s except the 3. So perhaps the cell with the highest number in the row remains, and others are set to highest-1.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth row input has 3 as the highest. So output row has 3 replaced by 3, and other cells set to 2.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row input has 4 as the highest. So output row has 4 replaced by 4, others set to 3.\n\nIn Example 2's sixth row input has 4 as the highest. So output row has 4 replaced by 5 (wait, but in Example 2's output, the 4 is replaced by 5, and adjacent cells become 5 and 6). So maybe this rule isn't consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the highest number in the input row is increased by 1, and other cells are set to highest.\n\nWait, in Example 0's fifth row, the highest is 3. Output row has 3 replaced by 2. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try to see what's common in all examples:\n\n- The output replaces certain numbers with their adjacent higher numbers minus one.\n- Higher numbers act as sources, propagating lower numbers around them.\n- The output seems to create a sort of heat map where the higher numbers are the heat sources, and lower numbers radiate out.\n\nFor example, in Example 0, the 3 in the input causes surrounding cells to become 2. The 2s in the input then cause surrounding cells to become 1, but in the output, the 2s are already in the input. Wait, this is unclear.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps each number in the input is replaced by the maximum number in its Moore neighborhood (adjacent cells including diagonals) minus 1. If that's the case, then:\n\nFor a cell with value V, new value = max(neighbors) -1.\n\nIf no neighbors are higher, then V remains.\n\nBut in Example 0's input, a 3 would have neighbors that are 1s and 8s. The max neighbor is 8, so 8-1=7. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, only consider neighbors of the same region. For example, if the cell is part of a block of 1s surrounded by 8s, then the max neighbor is 1, so it remains 1. But in the output, some 1s become 2s. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace each cell with the number of times it is adjacent to a higher number. But that would be a count, not a value based on the higher number.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nIn Example 0, the output has a vertical line of 2s where the input has a 3. For example, in the input's fifth row, there's a 3 in column 25. The output's fifth row has a vertical line of 2s in that column. Similarly, in Example 2, the 4 in the input's row 6 is replaced by a vertical line of 5s and 6s.\n\nMaybe the rule is that for each occurrence of a number N in the input, a vertical line is created in the output where each cell in that column is N-1. For example, a 3 in column X would make all cells in column X of the output be 2. But in Example 0's output, the fifth row's entire row is 2s, not just the column. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that any cell in the input with value N>1 creates a horizontal line in the output with N-1. So a 3 in the input becomes a horizontal line of 2s in the output. That matches Example 0's fifth row, where the 3 causes the entire row to be 2s. Similarly, in Example 1's fifth row, the 4 causes the row to be 3s. In Example 2's sixth row, the 4 causes the row to be 5s.\n\nBut in Example 2's input, the row with 4 has other numbers as well, like 3s, which become 5s. So if the rule is that the entire row is set to (max number in the row) -1, then:\n\nExample 0's fifth row has max 3 \u2192 3-1=2 \u2192 entire row becomes 2s.\n\nExample 1's fifth row has max 4 \u2192 4-1=3 \u2192 entire row becomes 3s.\n\nExample 2's sixth row has max 4 \u2192 4-1=3 \u2192 but output has 5s and 6s, which doesn't fit.\n\nThis doesn't fit Example 2. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait, Example 2's sixth row input is:\n\n[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8]\n\nOutput row 6 is:\n\n[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8]\n\nSo the 4 is replaced by 5, and the surrounding 3s are replaced by 5. This suggests that the 4 is replaced by 5, and the adjacent 3s are replaced by 5 as well. Then, maybe in the next step, those 5s would cause adjacent cells to become 4, but in this example, it's a single transformation.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with previous examples. Unless the rule is that each number N is replaced by N+1, but only if there's a higher number adjacent to it. But in Example 2's row 6, the 4 is next to 3s, which are lower. So that wouldn't trigger an increment.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that each cell is replaced by the maximum number in its row plus 1, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's think about the test input. The test input has rows with 1s, 2, 3, and 4s. The output should follow the pattern from the examples.\n\nIn the test input, the 2 in row 9, column 6 (assuming rows start at 0) is in the middle of 1s. According to Example 0's pattern, this 2 might cause the entire row to become 1s replaced by 2-1=1, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if the presence of a 2 in the row causes all 1s to become 2s. So in row 9 of the test input, which has a 2, all 1s would become 2s. But the output for that row would have 2s where there were 1s and the 2 remains. \n\nSimilarly, the 3 in row 23, column 18 would cause that row's 1s to become 3-1=2. But how does that fit with previous examples?\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that for each row, the highest number in that row is identified, and all occurrences of (highest -1) are replaced with highest -1. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input rows with 3 have 1s replaced with 2s. In Example 1's input rows with 4 have 2s replaced with 3s. In Example 2's input rows with 4 have 3s replaced with 5s. There's a pattern where the presence of a number N in a row causes (N-1) to be replaced with (N-1) and others to be replaced with (N-2). Or perhaps the highest number in the row dictates the replacement: if the highest is N, then all (N-1) are replaced with something.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is based on the highest number in the entire input. For example, in Example 0, the highest number is 8, which is the border. Then 3 is the highest in the data area. The output replaces 1s with 2s around the 3. But this doesn't help with the test input.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the test input's rows where there's a 2 and a 3. Following Example 0 and 1, the rows containing a 2 would have 1s replaced with 2s, and rows containing a 3 would have 1s replaced with 2s as well. Then, the 3's row would have 2s replaced with 3s. But in the test input, the 3 is in a row with 1s and 2s. So the row with the 3 would have 1s turned into 2s and 2s turned into 3s.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\n- Rows with 2 (row 9) would have 1s replaced with 2s.\n- Rows with 3 (row 23) would have 1s replaced with 2s and 2s replaced with 3s.\n- Rows with 4 (borders) remain 4s.\n\nBut in the test input, the 3 is in row 23, which also has a 2. So perhaps the presence of a higher number (3) overrides the lower ones.\n\nSo, for the test input's row 23:\n\nInput row 23: [4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4]\n\nIf the rule is that the highest number in the row dictates the replacement, here the highest is 4. So 3s would become 3 (4-1=3?), and 1s and 2 would become 3-1=2. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of a 3 in the row would turn all 1s into 2s and 2s into 3s. So the 2 in row 23 becomes 3, and the 1s become 2s.\n\nThis would mean the output for row 23 would have 3 where the 2 was, and 2s where the 1s were.\n\nSimilarly, the 2 in row 9 would turn all 1s in that row into 2s.\n\nLooking at the test input's row 9:\n\nInput row 9: [4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n\nOutput row 9 would have all 1s in that row replaced with 2s, and the existing 2 replaced with 3. But the output examples from training suggest that the highest number in the row is preserved. For example, in Example 0's fifth row, the 3 remains 3. So maybe the highest number in the row remains, and others are replaced with (highest -1).\n\nSo for row 9, the highest is 4 (border), but inside the data area, the highest is 2. So perhaps the data area's highest is 2, so 1s become 1 (2-1=1). But that doesn't change anything, which doesn't fit the examples.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nBased on Example 0 and 1, it seems that whenever a number N appears in a row, all occurrences of (N-1) in that row are replaced by (N-1), and lower numbers are replaced by (N-2). For example, if a row has a 3, then 2s become 2s (N-1), and 1s become 2s (N-2). But in Example 0's fifth row, the 3 causes 1s to become 2s. So if N is 3, then 1s are replaced by 3-1=2.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's fifth row, the presence of 4 causes 2s to become 4-2=2? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, in Example 1's fifth row, the input has 2s and a 4. The output replaces 2s with 3s, which is 4-1=3.\n\nAh, maybe the rule is: For each row, if there is a number N, then all numbers less than N in that row are replaced by (N-1). So the highest number in the row dictates the replacement value. For example:\n\n- If a row has 3, all numbers less than 3 become 2.\n- If a row has 4, all numbers less than 4 become 3.\n- And so on.\n\nThis fits Example 0's fifth row: highest is 3, so 1s and 2s become 2.\n\nExample 1's fifth row: highest is 4, so 2s and 3s become 3.\n\nExample 2's sixth row: highest is 4, so 3s become 3 (4-1=3), but in the output, the 4 is replaced by 5. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nBut in Example 2's input row 6, the highest is 4, but the output's row 6 has 5s. So the rule isn't that. Unless the highest number in the entire input is considered. But Example 2's input has 8s as borders, but the data area's highest is 4.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is based on the maximum number in the entire input. For Example 0, the data area's max is 3. So all numbers less than 3 are replaced with 2. Example 1's data max is 4, so numbers less than 4 are replaced with 3. Example 2's data max is 4, so numbers less than 4 are replaced with 3. But the output for Example 2's row 6 has 5s, which contradicts this.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let me try to look for a different angle.\n\nAnother commonality: in each example, the output introduces a new number that's one higher than the highest in the input. For instance, Example 0's input has 3, output has 3 and 2. Example 1's input has 4, output has 4 and 3. Example 2's input has 4, output has 5 and 6. So perhaps the new numbers are related to creating a gradient towards the highest number.\n\nFor Example 2's input, the 4 is replaced by 5, and adjacent cells become 5 and 6. Maybe each number is increased by 1, and adjacent cells are set to that value plus 1. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a cellular automaton step where each cell becomes the maximum of its neighbors plus 1. But this is hard to verify.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that in each row, the highest number determines the replacement, and lower numbers are set to highest -1. For the test input, rows with 4s (borders) would remain 4s. Rows with 3 would have 2s, rows with 2 would have 1s replaced with 2s. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRows with 2 (row 9): highest is 2, so 1s become 2-1=1? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if highest is 2, then 1s become 2.\n\nRows with 3 (row 23): highest is 3, so 1s and 2s become 3-1=2. The 3 becomes 3.\n\nBut in Example 0, the 3 remains 3. So in the test input's row 23, the 3 would stay, and the 1s and 2 become 2.\n\nThe test input's row 9 has a 2, so highest is 2. 1s become 2-1=1, but that doesn't change. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAnother possibility: each number N in the input is replaced by N+1 in the output, and adjacent cells are replaced by N. For example, a 3 becomes 4, and neighboring cells become 3. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make a best guess based on the examples. The strongest pattern I can see is that in each row, if there's a number N, all instances of (N-1) in that row are replaced by N-1, and others are replaced by N-2. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each occurrence of a number N in the input is replaced by N-1 in the output, and this propagates to adjacent cells. For example, a 3 becomes 2, and adjacent cells become 2 as well. Then, those 2s cause their neighbors to become 1, but the examples don't show this.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach for the test input:\n\nFor each row, if there's a number higher than 1 (like 2,3,4), replace all occurrences of 1 in that row with 2. If there's a 3, replace all 2s with 3. If there's a 4, replace all 3s with 4. Etc.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\n- Rows with 2 (row 9): replace all 1s with 2.\n- Rows with 3 (row 23): replace all 1s with 2 and 2s with 3.\n- Rows with 4 (borders): no change.\n\nSo the test input's row 9, which has a 2, would have all 1s replaced with 2. The 2 remains. \n\nRow 23, which has a 3, would have 1s replaced with 2 and the existing 2 replaced with 3.\n\nOther rows with 1s and no higher numbers remain 1s.\n\nBut in the test input, many rows have 1s and no higher numbers. For example, the rows in the middle with 1s. Those would remain 1s in the output.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, even rows without higher numbers had some replacements. For example, Example 0's input had rows with 1s and 8s, and in the output, some 1s became 2s. So maybe the rule is more complex.\n\nAnother possible rule: every occurrence of 1 in a row that is to the left of a higher number is replaced by 2. For example, in Example 0's input, the 3 is in the middle, and to the left of it are 1s that become 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to craft the output based on the assumption that in each row containing a number N, all instances of (N-1) are replaced by N-1, and other lower numbers are replaced by N-2. For the test input:\n\n- Rows with 2: replace 1s with 2-1=1, but that doesn't change. So maybe this is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, if a row contains a 2, replace all 1s with 2. If a row contains a 3, replace all 1s and 2s with 3-1=2. If a row contains a 4, replace all 1s, 2s, and 3s with 3.\n\nBut in the test input, the rows with 4 are the borders and remain 4. The rows with 1s and a 2 or 3 will have replacements.\n\nGiven this, here's the step-by-step for the test input:\n\n1. Rows with 2 (row 9): replace all 1s with 2.\n2. Rows with 3 (row 23): replace all 1s and 2s with 2 (3-1=2).\n3. Rows with 4: remain 4.\n\nBut in Example 0's fifth row, the 3 caused all 1s to become 2. So maybe in a row with N, replace all occurrences of (N-1) with N-1, and others with N-2. So for N=3, replace 2s with 2 and 1s with 2 (3-1=2). For N=2, replace 1s with 1 (2-1=1), which doesn't change. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really not working. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed to write the output based on the assumption that each occurrence of a number N in the input is replaced by N-1 in the output, and this propagates to adjacent cells. For the test input's rows with 2 and 3:\n\n- The 2 in row 9 becomes 1, and adjacent 1s become 2.\n- The 3 in row 23 becomes 2, and adjacent 1s and 2 become 2 and 3.\n\nBut this is speculative. Given the examples, especially Example 0 and 1, the main change is the introduction of a lower number around higher numbers. So the test output would likely have 2s where there were 1s near the 2 and 3, and 3s near the 3.",
