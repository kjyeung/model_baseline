        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is transformed into an output by modifying certain elements. Let's start by comparing the input and output of Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the rows have 8s in the middle, and there are some 2s arranged in a diamond or cross shape. The output seems to add more 8s around those 2s. For instance, the second row in the input has [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the output becomes [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]. So around the existing 2s, maybe inserting 8s in adjacent positions?\n\nWait, looking at the third row of Example 0's input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0], the output is [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]. So between the two 8 columns (positions 5 and 11?), there are new 8s inserted. Maybe whenever there's a non-zero number (like 2 or 8), certain positions relative to them get set to the middle value (the 8 in this case).\n\nLooking at Example 1, the middle value is 2. The input has 1s and 2s. The output adds 2s around the 1s. For example, in the second row of input, the 1s in the middle of the row have 2s added around them. So maybe the rule is that for any non-zero number that's not the middle value (the 8, 2, 1, 9 in examples), you place the middle value (the one in the center cross, like the 8s in example 0) in specific positions relative to those numbers.\n\nAnother observation: The middle line of the grid (the 5th row in all examples) is always a line of the middle value (8, 2, 1, 9) which remains unchanged. So maybe that's the central axis. Then, for each non-middle-value number (like 2 in example 0, 1 in example 1, 3 in example 2, 4 in test input), we replace certain positions with the middle value. \n\nIn example 0, the 2s are surrounded by 8s. For example, in the input row [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, ...], the output has 8s two positions away from the 2s. Wait, looking at positions: the original 2 is at index 2, and in the output, there's an 8 at index 8 and 14. Wait, maybe there's a symmetry here. The grid is 17 elements long. The middle is position 8 (since 0-based, indices 0-16). The 8s are at positions 5 and 11 in the input rows. Hmm, perhaps the pattern involves mirroring or placing the middle value in positions that are a certain distance from the non-middle elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe whenever a cell has a non-middle value (like 2 in example 0), the cells that are diagonally adjacent (or in a cross shape) around it are set to the middle value. For example, if there's a 2 at (row, col), then the cells at (row \u00b11, col \u00b11) become the middle value. Let me check:\n\nIn example 0's first input row with a 2 at position 2, the output has 8s at positions 8 and 14. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe it's a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the third row of Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nBetween the two 8s (positions 5 and 11), the output inserts 8s in positions 7,8,9. So maybe between the two central columns (positions 5 and 11), which are 8s, any existing non-8 elements in certain positions get replaced with 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that when there's a non-middle value (like 2 in example 0), the corresponding position on the opposite side of the middle line (the vertical line through columns 8) is set to the middle value. For example, in the first input row of example 0, the 2 is at column 2, so the mirror position would be column 14 (since 8 is the center, 8 + (8-2) = 14). The output row for that input has 8 at column 14. Wait, in the first example's output, the first row after input's first row (which was [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]) becomes the same. But the second input row is [0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0], and the output row has 8s at positions 8 and 14. Wait, position 8 is the center. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a non-middle number (like 2, 1, 3, 4 in the examples), the middle value (8, 2, 1, 9) is placed symmetrically around it. For example, if there's a 2 in a certain position, then the cells adjacent to it (left, right, up, down) are set to the middle value. But looking at example 0, the 2s are in a cross shape, and the output adds 8s around them. Wait, in example 0, the input row with [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, ...], the output inserts 8s in the middle of the row (positions 7,8,9). Maybe the 8s are placed in the middle columns (positions 5, 8, 11) when there's a 2 present elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input, the middle value is 9. The input has 4s arranged in certain positions. The output should replace some positions with 9s. Let's try to see what the pattern is. For example, in the test input's second row: [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0], the output would probably have 9s inserted in specific positions. If following the same pattern as the examples, perhaps the 4s cause 9s to be placed in certain symmetrical positions.\n\nIn example 0, when a 2 is present, 8s are added in positions that are mirrored across the vertical axis. For instance, if there's a 2 in column 2, then column 14 (mirror around column 8) gets an 8. Let's check:\n\nIn example 0's input row 1: [0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0], the output row becomes [0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]. The 8s are added at columns 8 and 14. Wait, column 8 is the center, and 14 is mirror of 2 (since 8 + (8-2) = 14). So for each non-middle value (2), the mirror position relative to the center (8) is set to the middle value (8). Also, maybe the same applies to other positions. Let's see:\n\nAnother example: in example 1, the input row 1 has 1s in columns 1-3. The output has 2s mirrored around the center (column 8). For instance, the mirror of column 1 is 15 (8 + (8-1)=15?), so 1s in columns 1-3 would have mirrors at 15-13. But looking at the output of example 1's first input row, the output row has 2s in positions 7,8,9 (middle) and 14,15 (mirror of 1-3). Hmm, maybe it's not exact mirroring but inserting the middle value in a cross pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that any cell that is part of a diamond shape (like the 2s in example 0) causes the middle value to be placed in the cells that form a diamond around the original positions. For example, a 2 in (row, col) leads to placing the middle value in (row \u00b11, col) and (row, col \u00b11), but that doesn't exactly fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all cells that are in certain positions relative to the non-middle numbers. For example, in example 0, the 2s are in a cross shape. The output adds 8s in a cross shape around them. Wait, in the input row [0,2,2,2,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,2,2,0], the output row has 8s in positions 7,8,9. That's the center of the row. Hmm, maybe whenever there's a group of non-middle values, the middle of the row (columns 8) gets filled with the middle value. But how does that apply across different rows?\n\nWait, looking at the test input, the middle value is 9. The input's second row is [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]. The expected output might have 9s inserted in positions mirrored relative to the 4s. For example, the 4s are in columns 1,2,3 and 7,8. The mirror of column 1 around the center (8) is column 15 (8 + (8-1) =15). So in the output, perhaps columns 15,14,13 would have 9s. But example 1's output for the first row, which has 1s in columns 1-3, the output adds 2s in columns 14-15 (mirror of 1-3). Wait, the mirror of column 1 is 15, 2 is 14, 3 is 13, etc. So in example 1's first output row, after the input has 1s in columns 1-3, the output has 2s in columns 14-15 (maybe only part of the mirror). Alternatively, maybe the middle value is placed in the same row's positions that are mirrored across the central column (8).\n\nIn example 0's first input row with 2 at column 2, the output has 8 at column 14 (mirror of 2). Similarly, in example 1's first input row, the 1s in columns 1-3 have mirrors at 15-13, and the output has 2s in columns 14-15. Hmm, not sure. Maybe the rule is to add the middle value in the mirrored positions of the non-middle numbers. So for each non-middle number in column x, set column (16 -x) to the middle value. Let's check:\n\nIn example 0's input row 1: the 2 is at column 2. 16-2=14. The output row has 8 at column 14. Yes, that's correct. Similarly, in example 1's first input row, the 1s are at columns 1,2,3. Mirrors would be 15,14,13. The output has 2s in 14 and 15 (maybe only adding in certain cases). But in example 1's output row 1, the output has 2s in columns 7,8,9 (middle) and 14,15. Wait, maybe it's not just mirroring but also adding in the central area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps whenever there's a non-middle value in a cell, the corresponding cell on the opposite side of the central vertical line (column 8) is set to the middle value. For example, column x's mirror is 16 -x. So for a non-middle value in column 2, set column 14 to middle value.\n\nBut looking at example 0's third input row: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0], the output row has 8s in columns 7,8,9. So mirroring the 2s in columns 13,14,15 (which were original 2s) would be columns 3,2,1. But the original input row has 2s in columns 1,2,3 (left side) and 13,14,15 (right side). The output inserts 8s in the middle columns. Hmm, maybe the middle columns (5,8,11) are always 8s, and the other positions are mirrored.\n\nWait, in the input rows, the 8s are always at columns 5 and 11 (assuming 17 columns, indexes 0-16). The middle is column 8. So columns 5 and 11 are fixed as 8s in example 0's input. The output adds 8s in column 8 and mirrored positions. Maybe whenever there's a non-middle value, the middle column (8) is filled with the middle value in certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves creating a symmetrical pattern around the central vertical line (column 8). So any non-middle elements on one side are mirrored with the middle value on the other side. For example, in example 0's input row 1, the 2 at column 2 leads to an 8 at column 14 (mirror of 2), and similarly for other elements.\n\nBut looking at example 2's output, in the third row of input, which has a 3 at column 2, the output has 1 at column 14. Because the middle value is 1 here. So mirroring the non-middle value's position with the middle value.\n\nAnother approach: in all examples, the output adds the middle value (8,2,1,9) in positions that are symmetric with the non-middle values. For each non-middle number in a cell, the cell mirrored across the central vertical line (column 8) is set to the middle value. Additionally, the middle column (8) is filled with the middle value where there are non-middle numbers.\n\nWait, looking at example 0's second input row:\n\nInput row: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput row: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nHere, the 2 is at column 2. The mirror is column 14. The output sets column 14 to 8 (middle value). Also, in the middle column (8), an 8 is added. So maybe whenever there's a non-middle value, the mirror column and the middle column are set to the middle value.\n\nBut in the output row, the middle column (8) is set to 8. But why? Because in the input, there's a 2 in column 2. So perhaps for each non-middle value in column x, set column (16 -x) and column 8 to the middle value.\n\nYes, that might explain it. Let's test this hypothesis with example 0:\n\nInput row 1: [0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row: [0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nSo the 2 is at column 2. Mirror column is 14 (16-2=14). So set column 14 to 8. Also, set column 8 (center) to 8. So in the output, columns 8 and 14 have 8 added.\n\nSimilarly, in example 0's third input row:\n\nInput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nHere, non-middle values (2s) are in columns 1-3 and 13-15. Their mirrors would be columns 15-13 and 3-1. But the output has 8s in columns 7-9 (middle). Wait, this doesn't fit. Unless the rule is different here. Maybe for each non-middle value, the center column (8) is set to the middle value, and the mirror is also set. But in this row, there are multiple non-middle values. So each 2 in columns 1,2,3 and 13,14,15 would set their mirrors (15,14,13 and 3,2,1) to 8. But the output has 8s in columns 7-9. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is to take the positions where non-middle values exist and fill the middle column (8) with the middle value. For example, any row that has a non-middle value gets the middle value in column 8. And additionally, the mirror column of the non-middle value is filled.\n\nBut in the third row of example 0's input, there are 2s in columns 1-3 and 13-15. Their mirrors would be columns 15-13 and 3-1. So the output should set those mirrored columns to 8. However, the output has 8s in columns 7-9. That doesn't align with that idea. \n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output replaces the cells that are diagonally adjacent to the non-middle values with the middle value. For example, a 2 in (row, col) would set (row-1, col-1), (row-1, col+1), (row+1, col-1), (row+1, col+1) to the middle value. Let's check example 0's input row 1:\n\nInput row 1 has 2 at column 2. The output has 8s at columns 8 and 14. If 8 is the middle column, perhaps the 2's presence causes the middle column to be filled. Alternatively, maybe the 2s are in rows that are vertically aligned, and their presence causes the middle column to be filled in adjacent rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to fill the middle column (8) with the middle value wherever there's a non-middle value in the same row. For example, any row that has a non-zero, non-middle number gets the middle value in column 8. Let's check example 0:\n\nIn input row 1, there's a 2. Output row has 8 in column 8. Input row 2 has 2s; output row has 8s in columns 7,8,9. Input row 3 has a 2; output row has 8 in column 8. Similarly, rows 7-9 in example 0's input have 2s and 0s. Their outputs have 8s in column 8. So maybe whenever there's a non-middle value in a row, column 8 is filled with the middle value. But in example 0's output row 2, columns 7,8,9 are filled with 8. So perhaps it's not just column 8, but the entire middle section.\n\nWait, the middle column is 8 (0-based index 8). The middle three columns (7,8,9) are filled with the middle value if there's a non-middle value present in the row. For example, in example 0's input row 2 (third row), which has 2s, the output fills columns 7,8,9 with 8s. Similarly, in example 1's input row 1, which has 1s, the output fills columns 7,8,9 with 2s. So the pattern could be: for any row containing a non-middle value, replace columns 7,8,9 with the middle value.\n\nBut how does that explain the mirrored columns in example 0's first output row, where there's an 8 at column 14? Because in that row, there's a 2 at column 2. If the rule is to replace 7,8,9 and mirrored columns, maybe for each non-middle value in column x, the mirrored column (16 -x) is set to the middle value. So in row 1 of example 0's input, the 2 at column 2 causes column 14 (16-2=14) to be 8. Also, the middle columns 7-9 are filled with 8s.\n\nSo combining these two rules:\n\n1. For any row that contains a non-middle value, set columns 7,8,9 to the middle value.\n\n2. For each non-middle value in column x of a row, set column (16 - x) to the middle value.\n\nThis seems to fit the examples. Let's test it on example 0's first output row:\n\nInput row 1 has a 2 in column 2. So set column 14 (16-2=14) to 8. Also, since the row has a non-middle value, set columns 7-9 to 8. The output row is [0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]. Wait, columns 7-9 are 0,8,0. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Oh, wait, the output in example 0's first output row has 8 at column 8 and 14. So maybe rule 1 is that if there's a non-middle value in the row, set column 8 to the middle value. And rule 2 is for each non-middle value at column x, set column (16-x) to middle value.\n\nIn example 0's input row 1: 2 at column 2. So column 14 is set to 8. Also, since the row has a non-middle value, column 8 is set to 8. So the output row becomes columns 2:2, 5:8, 8:8, 11:8, 14:8. That matches the output.\n\nAnother example: example 0's input row 2 has 2s in columns 1,2,3. So mirrored columns would be 15,14,13. So setting those to 8. Also, since there are non-middle values, column 8 is set to 8. The output row has 8s in columns 7,8,9. Wait, maybe the middle three columns (7,8,9) are set to 8. But why 7 and 9?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of multiple non-middle values in the row leads to filling more of the middle columns. Hmm, not sure. Let's look at example 0's output row 2:\n\nInput: [0,2,2,2,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,2,2,0]\n\nOutput: [0,2,2,2,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,2,2,2,0]\n\nSo columns 7,8,9 (middle three) are set to 8. The input has non-middle values (2s) in multiple columns, so the entire middle three columns are filled with 8s. Whereas in a row with a single non-middle value, only column 8 and the mirrored column are filled.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is:\n\n- For any row containing non-middle values, replace the middle column (8) with the middle value.\n\n- Additionally, for each non-middle value in column x, replace column (16 - x) with the middle value.\n\n- If there are multiple non-middle values in the row, also replace columns adjacent to the middle column (7 and 9) with the middle value.\n\nBut how to determine when to fill adjacent columns? For example, in example 0's row 2, there are three 2s, so columns 7-9 are filled. But in example 0's row 7, which has a single 2 in column 2, the output row has 8s in columns 8 and 14. So maybe when there's a cluster of non-middle values (like three in a row), the middle three columns are filled. But how to define a cluster?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of non-middle values in the row determines how many middle columns are filled. If there's one non-middle value, fill column 8 and its mirror. If there are three or more, fill columns 7-9.\n\nBut this seems a bit arbitrary. Let's check example 1's output. For example, in example 1's input row 1, there are three 1s. The output row has columns 7-9 filled with 2s (middle value). And the mirrors of the 1s (columns 1,2,3) are columns 15,14,13. In the output, columns 14 and 15 have 2s. So maybe filling the mirrors as well as the middle three columns.\n\nAnother possibility: whenever there's a non-middle value in the row, the middle column (8) is filled. Additionally, if the non-middle value is part of a cross or diamond shape (like three in a row), then adjacent columns (7 and 9) are also filled.\n\nThis might explain example 0's row 2, where the three 2s in a row cause columns 7-9 to be filled. Whereas a single 2 only fills column 8 and its mirror.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Let's look at example 2's input:\n\nTest input's second row: [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe non-middle values are 4s in columns 1-3 and 7-8. The middle value is 9. According to the rules:\n\n- For each non-middle 4 in columns 1,2,3, their mirrors are 15,14,13. So in the output, columns 13,14,15 should be set to 9.\n\n- Additionally, since there are non-middle values in the row, column 8 is set to 9.\n\n- Since there are multiple non-middle values (like a cluster), perhaps columns 7-9 are filled with 9.\n\nSo the output row would have 9s in columns 7,8,9 (middle three) and 13,14,15 (mirrors of 3,2,1). Also, the 4s in columns 7-8 would have mirrors 9 and 8 (since 16-7=9, 16-8=8). Wait, column 7's mirror is 9, and column 8's mirror is 8 (center). So the 4 in column 7 would set column 9 to 9, and 4 in column 8 would set column 8 to 9. But in the input row, there are 4s in columns 7 and 8. So their mirrors (9 and 8) would be set to 9. Column 8 is already set due to the first rule. So the output for this row would be:\n\nOriginal row: [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nAfter applying rules:\n\n- Replace middle column (8) with 9. So column 8 becomes 9.\n\n- For each 4 in columns 1,2,3: set mirrors 15,14,13 to 9.\n\n- For each 4 in columns 7 and 8: mirrors 9 and 8. So column 9 becomes 9 (due to 4 in column7), and column8 (already 9).\n\nSo the output row would have:\n\n[0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,9,9,0,9,0,9,9,9,0]\n\nBut wait, in the input row, the 4s are at 1,2,3 and 7,8. The mirrors for 1,2,3 are 15,14,13. So columns 13,14,15 would become 9. The mirrors for 7 and 8 are 9 and 8. So columns 9 and 8 would become 9. But column8 is already 9. So the output would have 9s in columns8,9,13,14,15. Also, since the row has non-middle values (4s), column8 is filled. Additionally, if there are multiple non-middle values, perhaps columns7 and 9 are also filled. But in the input row, there are multiple 4s, so maybe columns7-9 are filled with 9. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row's 4s are in columns1-3 and7-8. The output would be:\n\n[0,4,4,4,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,9,9,9,0]\n\nBut this may not match exactly. Looking at the training examples, perhaps the presence of any non-middle value in the row causes the entire middle three columns (7,8,9) to be filled with the middle value. Let's check example 0's row 2:\n\nInput has 2s in columns1-3 and13-15. The output fills columns7-9 with 8s, and mirrors of columns1-3 (15-13) with 8s. So the output row is:\n\n[0,2,2,2,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,2,2,2,0]\n\nWait, the mirrors of the 2s on the left (columns1-3) are columns15-13. But the output doesn't set those to 8. Instead, the original 2s on the right (columns13-15) are still present. So this contradicts the earlier idea. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nMaybe the rule is to fill the middle three columns (7,8,9) with the middle value if there are any non-middle values in the row. Additionally, for each non-middle value in column x, set column (16 - x) to the middle value. Let's test this:\n\nExample 0's row 1:\n\nInput has a 2 in column2. So mirror is column14. Middle columns7-9 are filled with 8. So output row is:\n\n[0,0,2,0,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output row is [0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]. Hmm, this doesn't fit. So perhaps the middle three columns are only filled if there's a cluster of non-middle values. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output has the middle value appearing in the same positions relative to the non-middle values. For example, in example 0, the 8s appear in the middle column (8) and the mirror positions of the 2s. Similarly, in example 1, the 2s appear in mirror positions of the 1s. So the general pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each non-middle value in column x, set column (16 - x) to the middle value. Also, set column8 to the middle value in that row.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For each row in the input:\n\n   a. If the row contains any non-middle value (i.e., a value that is not the middle value of that row, which is the value in columns5 and 11, which are part of the central cross), then:\n\n      i. Replace column8 with the middle value.\n\n      ii. For each non-middle value in column x of this row, replace column (16 - x) with the middle value.\n\nLet's test this on example 0's row1:\n\nOriginal row: [0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nNon-middle values: 2 in column2.\n\nMiddle value is 8.\n\nSo replace column8 with 8.\n\nMirror of column2 is 14, so replace column14 with 8.\n\nResult: [0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0], which matches the output.\n\nExample 0's row2:\n\nOriginal row: [0,2,2,2,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,2,2,0]\n\nNon-middle values: 2s in columns1,2,3 and13,14,15.\n\nMiddle value is 8.\n\nReplace column8 with 8.\n\nMirrors of columns1,2,3 are 15,14,13.\n\nSo replace columns15,14,13 with 8. But the original row already has 2s in 13-15. Wait, but according to the rule, we replace them with 8.\n\nBut the output row is [0,2,2,2,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,2,2,2,0]. Wait, the original 2s in 13-15 are still present. So this contradicts the rule.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that the rule is not to replace the mirror columns if they already contain non-middle values. Or maybe only apply the mirror rule to non-middle values on one side of the central axis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirroring is only applied to non-middle values on the left side of the central axis (columns0-7), and the right side is not mirrored. But in example 0's row2, the non-middle values are on both sides. So this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to mirror non-middle values from the left side to the right side, replacing with the middle value. So for each non-middle value on the left (columns0-7), mirror to columns8-16. For example, a non-middle value in column2 (left) would set column14 (16-2=14) to the middle value. But non-middle values on the right (columns9-16) are ignored, as they might be mirrored from the left. \n\nBut in example 0's row2, the right side (columns13-15) have 2s, which are non-middle. According to this rule, they would not be mirrored. So in the output, those 2s would remain. The output row has 8s in columns7-9 and the original 2s on both ends. So perhaps the mirroring is only done for non-middle values on the left side. \n\nIn example 0's row2, the left side has 2s in columns1-3. Their mirrors are columns15-13. So set those to 8. But the output row still has 2s in columns13-15. So this doesn't fit. \n\nThis is getting really confusing. Maybe another approach: look at the test input and try to see what needs to be done.\n\nTest input's second row: [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nMiddle value is9. Non-middle values are4s in columns1-3 and7-8.\n\nFollowing the pattern from examples, we need to:\n\n1. For each non-middle value in column x (left side), set column (16-x) to9.\n\nSo columns1-3 (4s) would set columns15-13 to9.\n\nAlso, columns7-8 (4s) would set columns9 and8 to9.\n\nBut column8 is already part of the central cross (9 in columns5 and11), so perhaps it's set to9 regardless.\n\nAdditionally, since there are non-middle values in the row, column8 is set to9.\n\nSo the output for this row would be:\n\nOriginal: [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nReplace column8 with9: [...,8\u21929].\n\nMirrors of columns1-3: set columns15,14,13 to9.\n\nMirrors of columns7 and8: set columns9 and8 to9. Column8 is already9.\n\nSo the row becomes:\n\n[0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,9,9,0,9,0,9,9,9,0]\n\nBut the existing 4s in columns7 and8 would be replaced? Or is the mirroring additive?\n\nWait, the input has 4s in columns7 and8. Their mirrors are columns9 and8. So set those to9. So column9 becomes9, column8 becomes9 (even if it had a4 before). So the output row becomes:\n\n[0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,9,9,0,9,0,9,9,9,0]\n\nBut in the input, column7 is4. Mirror is9. So column9 becomes9. Column8 is4. Mirror is8. So column8 becomes9. So in the output row, columns7-9 are [4,9,9].\n\nBut according to the examples, when there's a non-middle value, the middle column (8) is set to the middle value. So regardless of what was there before, column8 becomes9.\n\nSo the output row would have columns7-9 as4,9,9? But why would column7 remain as4? Because the rule is to set mirrors of non-middle values, not to alter the original non-middle values. \n\nBut in the training examples, the original non-middle values are retained. For example, in example0's input row1, the 2 remains, and the mirrors are set to8. So the non-middle values are not replaced, only their mirrors and the middle column.\n\nSo in the test input's row2, the 4s in columns1-3 and7-8 remain, but their mirrors are set to9, and column8 is set to9.\n\nThus, the row becomes:\n\n[0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,9,9,0,9,0,9,9,9,0]\n\nBut how does this align with the training examples? For example, in example0's row1, the 2 is retained, and the mirror and column8 are set to8.\n\nApplying this to the test input's row2, the output would have 4s in columns1-3 and7-8, and 9s in columns8-9 and13-15.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, sometimes the middle three columns are filled with the middle value. For example, in example0's row2 (input has 2s on both ends), the middle three columns are filled with8. So maybe when there are non-middle values on both sides, the middle three columns are filled.\n\nBut how to determine when to fill middle three columns versus just column8.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is:\n\nFor each row:\n\n- If any non-middle value exists in the row, set column8 to the middle value.\n\n- For each non-middle value in column x (0 <= x <8), set column (16 -x) to the middle value.\n\n- For each non-middle value in column x (8 <x <=16), set column (16 -x) to the middle value.\n\nBut this might result in duplicates. Alternatively, perhaps the mirroring is applied regardless of which side the non-middle value is on. So a non-middle value in columnx will set column (16 -x) to the middle value, regardless of which side it's on. However, this would cause symmetric changes. For example, a non-middle value in column14 (right side) would set column2 to the middle value.\n\nBut looking at example0's row2 in the output, the non-middle values are still present on both ends. So this suggests that the mirroring is only applied to non-middle values on one side, perhaps the left. Or maybe the mirroring is applied to all non-middle values, but the original non-middle values are retained.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to apply the pattern to the test input.\n\nTest input's row2: [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nMiddle value is9. Non-middle values are4s in columns1-3 and7-8.\n\nFollowing the examples:\n\n- For each non-middle value in columns1-3 (left side), set their mirrors (15,14,13) to9.\n\n- For each non-middle value in columns7-8 (left of center?), mirrors are columns9 and8. So set them to9.\n\n- Set column8 to9 because there are non-middle values in the row.\n\nSo the output row becomes:\n\nColumns:\n\n0:0\n\n1:4\n\n2:4\n\n3:4\n\n4:0\n\n5:9\n\n6:0\n\n7:4\n\n8:9 (due to rule 1)\n\n9:9 (mirror of7)\n\n10:0\n\n11:9\n\n12:0\n\n13:9 (mirror of3)\n\n14:9 (mirror of2)\n\n15:9 (mirror of1)\n\n16:0\n\nSo the row becomes: [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,9,9,0,9,0,9,9,9,0]\n\nBut in the training examples, when there are multiple non-middle values, the middle three columns are filled. For example, in example0's row2, the middle three columns (7-9) are filled with8. So perhaps in the test input's row2, since there are non-middle values in columns7-8, the middle three columns (7-9) are filled with9. \n\nBut according to the current rules, column7 is4 (non-middle value), and its mirror is9. So column9 is set to9. Column8 is set to9 due to the presence of non-middle values. Column7 remains4. So the middle three columns would be4,9,9. But in the training examples, when there's a cluster of non-middle values, the entire middle three are filled. \n\nThis inconsistency suggests that maybe the pattern is to fill the middle three columns whenever there are non-middle values in the row, regardless of their position. So for any row with non-middle values, columns7-9 are filled with the middle value, and the mirrors of the non-middle values are set to the middle value.\n\nApplying this to the test input's row2:\n\nColumns7-9 become9, regardless of previous values. So columns7:9,8:9,9:9.\n\nMirrors of non-middle values in columns1-3:15,14,13 set to9.\n\nMirrors of non-middle values in columns7-8:9 and8. So column9 is already9, column8 is9.\n\nSo the row becomes:\n\n[0,4,4,4,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,9,9,9,0]\n\nThis aligns with example0's row2, where the middle three columns are filled. \n\nSo the rules seem to be:\n\n1. For any row that contains a non-middle value:\n\n   a. Replace columns7,8,9 with the middle value.\n\n   b. For each non-middle value in columnx, replace column (16-x) with the middle value.\n\nThis would explain example0's row1, where columns7-9 are filled with8 (even though there was only one non-middle value), and column14 is filled as mirror of2.\n\nIn example0's row1, after applying rule 1a, columns7-9 become8. Then rule 1b: mirror of2 (column14) becomes8.\n\nBut in example0's row1 input, columns7-9 were originally0,0,0. The output after rule 1a would set them to8,8,8. But the actual output row is [0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]. Columns7-9 are 0,8,0. This contradicts the assumption.\n\nHmm, this is not working. Maybe the rule is different. Let's look for another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: notice that in the output of the training examples, the middle value appears in the same positions where the input has non-middle values, but mirrored across the central column (8). For example, in example0's row1 input, the 2 is at column2. In the output, there's an8 at column14 (16-2=14) and column8. So the pattern is to place the middle value at column8 and the mirror column of any non-middle value.\n\nSo for each non-middle value in columnx:\n\n- Set columnx's mirror (16-x) to middle value.\n\n- Also, set column8 to middle value.\n\nThis would explain example0's row1: 2 at column2 \u2192 set column14 and8 to8. The output row becomes columns2:2,5:8,8:8,11:8,14:8.\n\nSimilarly, example0's row2 has 2s at columns1-3 and13-15. For each 2 in column1, set column15 and8 to8. For each 2 in column2, set14 and8. For each2 in column3, set13 and8. And similarly for the 2s in13-15. But this would result in column8 being set multiple times (still 8), and mirrors for each 2. But the output row has 8s in columns7-9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to create a cross shape around each non-middle value. For example, placing the middle value in the same row and column as the non-middle value, forming a cross. But this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother observation: the output in each example seems to have the middle value forming a kind of vertical line in the center, and also mirroring the non-middle values. For example, in example0's output, there's a vertical line of8s in column8, and mirrored8s where the input had2s.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\n- For each row in the input:\n\n   a. If the row contains any non-middle values, set column8 to the middle value.\n\n   b. For each non-middle value in columnx, set column (16-x) to the middle value.\n\nThis would explain the examples.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's row1:\n\nInput has 2 at column2. So set column8 to8. Set column14 (16-2=14) to8. Output row: [0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]. Which matches.\n\nExample0's row2:\n\nInput has 2s at columns1-3 and13-15. So set column8 to8. For each 2 in column1, set column15 to8. For column2, set14. For column3, set13. For column13, set3. For column14, set2. For column15, set1. So the output row would have 8s in columns1-3 and13-15 (mirrors), but in the actual output row, the 2s remain in those positions, and 8s are in columns7-9. So this contradicts.\n\nThus, this rule is not sufficient.\n\nAnother possible pattern is that the output combines the original input with a reflection of the non-middle values around the central column, replacing the reflected positions with the middle value. So, any non-middle value on the left is reflected on the right as the middle value, and vice versa. But the original non-middle values remain.\n\nFor example, in example0's row1:\n\nOriginal left side has a 2 at column2. The right side's column14 is set to8. The middle column8 is set to8. The 2 remains.\n\nIn example0's row2:\n\nThe left side has 2s at columns1-3. Their mirrors are columns15-13, which are set to8. The middle columns7-9 are set to8. The 2s on the right (13-15) are original and remain.\n\nBut the output row's mirrors are not set. So this suggests that only the non-middle values on the left are mirrored to the right as middle values, and the middle column is filled if any non-middle values are present.\n\nBut this still doesn't explain why the middle columns7-9 are filled in row2 of example0.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is:\n\n- For each non-middle value in the row, set its mirror column to the middle value.\n\n- Set the middle column (8) to the middle value.\n\n- If there are any non-middle values in the row, also set the two adjacent columns (7 and9) to the middle value.\n\nSo for example0's row1:\n\n- One non-middle value \u2192 set column8 and its mirror (14) to8. Also set columns7 and9 to0 (no, they become8). Wait, no. If the rule is to set 7 and9 when there are any non-middle values, then row1 would have columns7,8,9 as8. But in the output, only column8 is set. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let me look at the test input and try to apply what I think is the pattern.\n\nTest input's row2:\n\n[0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nMiddle value is9.\n\nNon-middle values are4s in columns1-3 and7-8.\n\nAccording to example0's pattern, the output should have:\n\n- For each4 in columns1-3, set their mirrors (15,14,13) to9.\n\n- For each4 in columns7-8, set mirrors9 and8 to9.\n\n- Set column8 to9.\n\nSo the output row would be:\n\n[0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,9,9,0,9,0,9,9,9,0]\n\nAdditionally, if the presence of multiple non-middle values causes columns7-9 to be filled with9, then those columns become9.\n\nSo in the output row:\n\n[0,4,4,4,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,9,9,9,0]\n\nThis matches what example0's row2 does, where the middle three columns are filled.\n\nThus, the rule seems to be:\n\nFor each row:\n\n1. If there are any non-middle values, set columns7,8,9 to the middle value.\n\n2. For each non-middle value in columnx, set column (16-x) to the middle value.\n\nLet's apply this to example0's row1:\n\nNon-middle value in column2. So set columns7-9 to8. Also set column14 (16-2=14) to8.\n\nResulting row:\n\n[0,0,2,0,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output row is [0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]. So this doesn't fit. So this rule is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is:\n\nFor each non-middle value in the row:\n\n- Set column (16-x) to middle value.\n\n- Set column8 to middle value.\n\nBut if there are multiple non-middle values in the row, set columns7 and9 as well.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following pattern:\n\n- For each row containing non-middle values:\n\n   a. Set column8 to the middle value.\n\n   b. For each non-middle value in columnx, set column (16-x) to the middle value.\n\nApplying this to the test input's row2:\n\nColumns1-3 have4s. Their mirrors are15,14,13. So set those to9. Columns7-8 have4s. Their mirrors are9 and8. So set9 and8 to9. Column8 is already set. The output row becomes:\n\n[0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,9,9,0,9,0,9,9,9,0]\n\nBut according to example0's row2, when there are multiple non-middle values, columns7-9 are filled. So in the test input's row2, perhaps columns7-9 are filled with9. So the row becomes:\n\n[0,4,4,4,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,9,9,9,0]\n\nThis would align with example0's row2.\n\nThus, the final answer for the test input would have the middle three columns (7-9) filled with9 wherever there are non-middle values, and the mirrors of non-middle values set to9.\n\nApplying this to all rows of the test input:\n\nFor each row:\n\n- If the row contains any non-middle value (4 in this case), set columns7-9 to9.\n\n- For each4 in columnx, set column (16-x) to9.\n\nNow, let's process each row of the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nNo non-middle values (only9s in columns5 and11). So no change. Output same as input.\n\nRow1: [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nNon-middle values:4s in columns1-3 and7-8.\n\nSet columns7-9 to9. Mirrors of columns1-3 are15,14,13 \u2192 set to9. Mirrors of7-8 are9 and8 \u2192 set to9. So output row:\n\n[0,4,4,4,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,9,9,9,0]\n\nRow2: [0,4,0,4,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nNon-middle values:4s in columns1 and3.\n\nSet columns7-9 to9. Mirrors of1 and3 are15 and13 \u2192 set to9. So output row:\n\n[0,4,0,4,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,9,0,9,0]\n\nRow3: [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nNon-middle values:4s in columns1-3.\n\nSet columns7-9 to9. Mirrors of1-3 are15-13 \u2192 set to9. So output row:\n\n[0,4,4,4,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,9,9,9,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nNo non-middle values. Output same.\n\nRow5: [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9] (all9s). Output same.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]. No non-middle. Same.\n\nRow7: [0,0,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nNon-middle:4 in column2. Set columns7-9 to9. Mirror of2 is14 \u2192 set to9. Output:\n\n[0,0,4,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,0,9,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,4,0,4,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nNon-middle:4s in columns1 and3. Set columns7-9 to9. Mirrors15 and13 \u21929. Output:\n\n[0,4,0,4,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,9,0,9,0]\n\nRow9: [0,0,4,0,0,9,0,4,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nNon-middle:4s in column2,7,8. Set columns7-9 to9. Mirrors of2 is14,7 is9,8 is8. So set columns14,9,8 to9. But columns7-9 are already9. Output:\n\n[0,0,4,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,0,9,0,0]\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]. No change.\n\nRow11: all9s. Same.\n\nRow12: same as row0.\n\nRow13: same as row0.\n\nRow14: [0,0,0,0,0,9,0,4,0,4,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nNon-middle:4s in columns7 and9. Set columns7-9 to9. Mirrors of7 is9, 9 is7. So set columns9 and7 to9. But they are already9. Output:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow15: same as row0.\n\nRow16: same as row0.\n\nPutting this all together, the test output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,4,4,4,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,9,9,9,0]\n[0,4,0,4,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,9,0,9,0]\n[0,4,4,4,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,9,9,9,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n[9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]\n[0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,4,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,0,9,0,0]\n[0,4,0,4,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,9,0,9,0]\n[0,0,4,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,0,9,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n[9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]\n[0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a lot of 8s in the middle row and column. The output seems to add more 8s around the existing 2s. For instance, in the second row of the input, there's a 2 at position 2. In the output, around that 2, there are 8s in positions that might be adjacent. Wait, let me check the exact indices.\n\nLooking at the second input row in Example 0: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output for that row is [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]. So where there was a 2 in the input, in the output, there's an 8 in positions 8 and 14. Hmm, maybe it's mirroring the 2s across the central 8 column?\n\nWait, the input rows have 8s in the middle (position 5 and 11, perhaps?), and the output adds 8s in positions that are symmetric around those 8 columns. Let me see the structure. The input lists are 17 elements long. Let's index them from 0 to 16. The middle element is at 8. But looking at the input rows, the 8s are at position 5 and 11, maybe? Wait, in the first input row of Example 0, the 8 is at position 5 and 11. So 5 and 11 are positions in the list. The output seems to insert 8s in certain positions related to the non-8 numbers. \n\nIn Example 0's output, the rows with 2s now have 8s placed symmetrically. For example, in the third input row of Example 0, there are three 2s centered at position 2, 3, 4. The output adds 8s around them. Maybe the pattern is that for any non-zero, non-8 number in the input, you create a cross shape (like a plus sign) with the 8s around it. Wait, but in the output, the 2s remain, and 8s are added around them. Or perhaps it's that the 8s are mirrored across the central 8 columns. Let me see.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 8s are at positions 5 and 11 in each row. So the row is split into two halves by these 8s. The output seems to mirror the non-8 elements across these 8s. For example, in the second row of Example 0's input, the 2 is at position 2. In the output, there's an 8 at position 8 (maybe the mirror of 2 around 5? Wait, 5 - 2 = 3, so mirror would be 5 +3=8. Yes, that makes sense. So for any element that's not 8, the output places a copy of the 8 (or the value of the 8) in the mirrored position across the central 8 columns. \n\nWait, in Example 0, the input has 8s at positions 5 and 11. So the middle of the list is at position 8. Wait, 17 elements: positions 0-16. The two 8s are at 5 and 11. The distance from 5 to 8 is 3, and from 11 to 8 is 3. So perhaps each row has two 8s that split the row into three parts: left (positions 0-4), middle (5 and 11), and right (12-16). Then, the left part is mirrored to the right part, and vice versa, using the 8s as mirrors. \n\nLooking at Example 0's output. The second row of input has a 2 at position 2. The output has 8s at positions 8 and 14. Wait, position 2 is in the left part. The mirror of position 2 across the left 8 (position 5) would be position 8 (since 5 - 2 = 3; 5 +3 = 8). Then, mirror across the right 8 (position 11) would be 11 +3 =14. So the 2 at position 2 causes 8s to be placed at 8 and 14. But in the output row for that example, the 2 is still present, and 8s are added at positions 8 and 14. Wait, but in the output, the 2 is still there, so maybe the transformation is: for each non-8 element in the left or right parts, create a mirrored 8 in the opposite part. Or perhaps the non-8 elements are being mirrored as 8s. \n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has 2s in the middle row. Let's check that. The input in Example 1 has elements with 2s in positions 5 and 11 again. For instance, the second input row in Example 1 is [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. The output row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]. So here, the 1s in the left part (positions 1-3) are mirrored as 2s in positions 7-9 (mirror across the left 2 at position 5: position 1 is mirrored to 9 (5 -1 =4, 5+4=9?), but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the mirroring is done across each 2 in the row. \n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that whenever there's a non-zero number (other than the central 8 or 2 or 9 in the test case) in the left or right parts of the row, you insert a cross or a diamond shape around it using the central number (8, 2, etc.), but that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the structure of each example, the input rows have two instances of the central number (like 8 in example 0, 2 in example 1, 1 in example 2) at positions 5 and 11. The output seems to mirror the elements around these two central points, replacing them with the central number. \n\nFor instance, in Example 0, the input row [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]. So the 2 in position 2 (left of the first 8) is mirrored as 8 in position 8 (the next 8 after the first) and position 14 (mirror around the second 8). Wait, position 2 and 8: the distance from 2 to 5 (the first 8) is 3, so mirrored would be 5 +3 =8. Then, from the second 8 at position 11, the distance to 8 is 3, so mirrored would be 11 +3=14. So the 2 in position 2 is causing 8s to be placed in positions 8 and 14. But in the output row, the original 2 remains. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that any non-central number (i.e., not 8, 2, etc.) in the left or right sections is mirrored across the central columns, replacing the mirrored positions with the central number. For example, in the left part of the row (before the first central number), any non-zero element is mirrored in the right part (after the second central number) as the central number. Similarly, elements in the right part are mirrored to the left. \n\nWait, let's take Example 0 again. The input row [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The 2 is at position 2. The central numbers are at 5 and 11. The left part is positions 0-4, middle 5, then positions 6-10, middle 11, then 12-16. So the left part is mirrored across the first central number (5), and the right part (positions 12-16) are mirrored across the second central number (11). \n\nSo for the left part (positions 0-4), any element is mirrored across position 5. For example, position 2 (distance 3 from 5) would mirror to position 5 +3 =8. Similarly, position 1 would mirror to 9, etc. But in the output, the mirrored positions are set to the central number (8 in this case). So the 2 at position 2 would cause position 8 to become 8, and also the right part's mirrored position (maybe position 14, which is 11 + (11-8) =14). Wait, maybe each non-central element in the left part is mirrored to the right side of the first central number and the left side of the second central number? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire left half (positions 0-5) is mirrored around position 5, and the right half (positions 11-16) is mirrored around position 11. Then, any non-zero element in the left half (excluding the central number at 5) is mirrored to the right side of the left half (positions 6-10) as the central number, and similarly for the right half.\n\nWait, in Example 0's first input row, all elements are 0 except the 8s at 5 and 11, so the output is the same. The second input row has a 2 at position 2. The output has 8s at positions 8 and 14. Let's see: position 2 is mirrored across 5 to position 8 (5 + (5-2) =8). Then, perhaps mirrored across 11 to position 14 (11 + (11-8) =14). Wait, the 8 is at position 5 and 11, so the distance between them is 6. So for each element in the left part (0-4), its mirror across 5 is 5 + (5 - x) = 10 -x. For example, x=2: 10-2=8. So position 2's mirror is 8. Then, the mirror across 11 would be 11 + (11 - x), but x is already on the right side. Hmm, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each element in the left section (0-4) is mirrored around the first central number (position 5) into the positions 6-10 (the middle section between the two 8s) as 8. Then, elements in the right section (12-16) are mirrored around the second central number (position 11) into positions 6-10 as 8. \n\nWait, in Example 0's third input row: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]. The output is [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]. The left part has 2s at positions 1,2,3. Their mirrors across 5 would be positions 9,8,7. So 5 -1 =4 \u2192 5 +4 =9; 5-2=3 \u21925+3=8; 5-3=2 \u21925+2=7. So the left 2s at positions 1,2,3 would mirror to positions 9,8,7. But in the output, positions 7,8,9 are 8. So that's correct. Similarly, the right part has 2s at positions 13,14,15. Mirroring across 11 (11 -13 = -2 \u2192 11 + (-2) =9, but that's not right. Alternatively, the right part elements are mirrored into the middle section. So position 13: 11 - (13-11) =9. So 13's mirror is 9. So the 2 at position 13 would create an 8 at position 9. But in the output, position 9 is 8. But in the input row, there's a 2 at 13. So this seems to fit. So the rule could be: for any non-zero element in the left or right sections (positions 0-4 and 12-16), mirror them into the middle section (positions 6-10) using the central numbers (8,2, etc.), replacing those positions with the central number. \n\nSo the transformation would be:\n\nFor each row:\n\n- Identify the central numbers (e.g., 8 in Example 0) at positions 5 and 11.\n\n- For each element in the left section (positions 0-4), if it's non-zero, mirror it across position 5 into the middle section (positions 6-10), replacing the mirrored position with the central number.\n\n- For each element in the right section (positions 12-16), if it's non-zero, mirror it across position 11 into the middle section (positions 6-10), replacing the mirrored position with the central number.\n\nThis seems to fit the examples.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1. Take the second input row of Example 1:\n\nInput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nThe central numbers are 2 at positions 5 and 11.\n\nLeft section: positions 0-4. Here, positions 1,2,3 have 1s.\n\nMirroring across 5: position 1 \u2192 5 + (5-1) =9. So position 9 becomes 2 (the central number). Similarly, position 2 \u21925 +3=8 \u21922. Position3\u21925+2=7\u21922. So positions 7,8,9 become 2,2,2. That matches the output row: [0,1,1,1,0,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,2,1,1,0]. Wait, in the output, the positions 7,8,9 are 2,2,2. Yes. Also, the right section has 1s at positions 14,15. Mirroring across 11: position14 \u219211 - (14-11) =8. So position8 would be set to 2. But position8 was already set from the left mirror. So for the right 1s at 14 and 15: 14-11=3 \u219211-3=8 \u2192 position8. But in the output row, position8 is 2. So this could be overlapping. Similarly, position15 \u219211 - (15-11)=7 \u2192 position7 becomes 2. So in the output, positions 7 and 8 are 2, which could be from both left and right mirrors. So the rule seems to apply.\n\nIn Example 2, the input row [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0] becomes [0,3,0,3,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,3,0]. Wait, the central number is 1. Let me check. The input row has 1s at 5 and 11. The left section has 3s at positions1 and3. Mirroring across 5: position1 \u21925 + (5-1)=9 \u21929 becomes 1. Position3 \u21925 +2=7 \u21927 becomes1. So in the output row, positions7 and9 would be 1. But the input row has a 3 at position7. The output row for Example2's third row is [0,3,0,3,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,3,0]. Wait, position7 is 3 in input, but in output it's 3. Hmm, that contradicts the previous pattern. Wait, perhaps the mirroring only applies to non-central numbers. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the input row in Example 2's third row is [0,3,0,3,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0]. The output is [0,3,0,3,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,3,0]. The central numbers are 1 at positions5 and11. The left section (positions0-4) has 3s at positions1 and3. Mirroring across5: position1 \u21925 +4=9. So position9 becomes1. Position3 \u21925 +2=7. So position7 becomes1. But in the input, position7 is 3. So in the output, position7 remains3. That's conflicting. So maybe the mirroring only applies if the mirrored position in the middle section is 0. Or perhaps there's another rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the mirroring is additive. If the mirrored position already has a non-zero value, it's left as is. But in Example 0's third row, the middle section (positions6-10) are 0s in the input, so the mirrored 8s are added. But in Example2's third row, position7 in input is3, which in output is3. So maybe the mirroring process doesn't overwrite existing non-zero values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirroring is done only for the left and right sections, and the middle section (positions6-10) is filled with the central number where there were non-zero elements in the left or right sections. Wait, that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that for each non-zero element in the left or right sections, you set the corresponding mirrored positions in the middle section to the central number. For example, if there's a 3 in the left section, then in the middle section (mirror positions), set them to 1 (the central number in Example2). But in Example2's third input row, the left section has 3s at positions1 and3. Their mirrored positions in the middle section (across 5) are positions9 and7. So in the output, those positions become1. But in the input row, position7 has a3, which in the output becomes3. So this contradicts. Hmm, maybe the mirroring only applies to elements in the left and right sections that are not part of the central number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to create a diamond or cross shape around each non-central number. For example, in Example0's input where there's a 2, the output adds 8s around it in a cross pattern. But looking at the output rows, the 2s are surrounded by 8s. For example, the third row of Example0's input has three 2s in a line. The output has 8s above and below, forming a cross. But that seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, considering the outputs, it looks like the middle section (positions6-10) between the two central numbers (5 and11) is being filled with the central number where the left or right sections have non-zero numbers. For example, in Example0's second row, the left section has a 2, so positions8 (mirror of 2) and14 (mirror of 2 across the right central number) are filled with8. But how does that fit into the structure?\n\nWait, let's take the test input now. The central number is9. So positions5 and11 are9. For each non-zero element in the left or right sections, their mirrored positions across the central numbers are filled with9.\n\nLooking at the test input's second row: [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]. The left section has4s at positions1,2,3. Mirroring across position5 (central9), each of these positions would have mirrored positions:\n\nposition1 \u21925 + (5-1) =9 \u2192 position9.\n\nposition2 \u21925 +3=8 \u2192 position8.\n\nposition3 \u21925 +2=7 \u2192 position7.\n\nSo in the output, these mirrored positions (7,8,9) would be set to9. But the input row already has4s at7,8. So would the output replace them with9? Let's see. In the output, those positions would be9. So the second row of the test input's output would be [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,9,9,9,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]. Then, the right section of the input row (positions12-16) are0s, so nothing is mirrored there.\n\nSimilarly, the third row of the test input is [0,4,0,4,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]. Left section has4s at1 and3. Their mirrored positions are9 and7. So in the output, positions7 and9 would be9. So the third row's output would be [0,4,0,4,0,9,0,9,0,9,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nContinuing this pattern for all rows, the output would have the mirrored positions in the middle section filled with9 wherever the left or right sections have non-zero elements.\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input:\n\nTest input row 2: [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0] becomes [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,9,9,9,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nTest input row 8: [0,4,0,4,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0] becomes [0,4,0,4,0,9,0,9,0,9,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nTest input row 9: [0,0,4,0,0,9,0,4,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]. Left section has4 at position2. Mirror across5 to position8. So output would have9 at8. Also, the input has4s at7 and8 (positions in the middle section). Since the input's middle section has4s, according to the pattern, those would be replaced by9. So the row becomes [0,0,4,0,0,9,0,9,9,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nWait, but the original input has4s in the middle section (positions7 and8). Do those get replaced by9? Let's check the training examples. In Example0's input, there are rows with non-8 elements in the middle section, and in the output, they are replaced by8s. For example, in Example0's input row 8: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. The output row is [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]. So here, the 2 is in the middle section (position8), and the output leaves it as2. But the left section has0s, so no mirroring. Wait, this contradicts the previous pattern. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirroring is only for elements in the left and right sections, and the middle section elements are left as-is. So in Example0's input row8, the 2 is in the middle section (position8), so it remains. The output adds 8s in positions2 and14 (mirrors of position8's 2?) Not sure. This complicates the pattern.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to look at each element in the left and right sections. For each non-zero element in the left section (positions0-4), mirror it across the first central number (position5) into the middle section (positions6-10), replacing those positions with the central number. Similarly, for each non-zero element in the right section (positions12-16), mirror it across the second central number (position11) into the middle section (positions6-10), replacing those positions with the central number. Elements in the middle section (positions6-10) are left as-is, except when overwritten by the mirroring.\n\nLet's re-examine Example0's row8:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nLeft section (0-4) has no non-zero elements. The middle section has a2 at position8. The right section (12-16) has no non-zero elements. So why does the output have8s at positions2 and14? Because the middle section's 2 is in position8. Mirroring it across the first central number (position5) would take 8-5=3 \u21925-3=2 \u2192position2. So the 2 in the middle section would mirror to position2 as8. Similarly, mirroring across the second central number (11) gives11 + (8-11)=8 \u2192 wait, 11 - (11-8)=8. No, perhaps mirroring the middle section elements to left and right sections. But this would complicate things. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirroring is bidirectional. Any non-zero element in the left section mirrors to the middle and right sections. Similarly for the right section. This is getting too confusing. Let's think of a different approach.\n\nLooking at all examples, the central number (like8,2,1) is present in the middle of the rows. The output seems to create a symmetrical pattern around these central numbers. For example, in Example0's output, wherever there's a2 in the left section, there are8s in the middle and right sections. This suggests that the pattern is to create a symmetric reflection of the non-central numbers using the central number. \n\nAnother approach: the output is formed by taking the input and, for each element in the left section (positions0-4), placing the central number in the position mirrored across the first central number (position5). Similarly, for the right section (positions12-16), mirror across the second central number (position11) into the middle section. This would explain why in Example0's second row, the2 at position2 leads to8s at positions8 and14 (mirrored across5 and11).\n\nWait, if position2 is mirrored across5: 5 - (2-5) = 8. So 2's mirror across5 is8. Similarly, mirrored across11: 11 + (11-2) =20, which is beyond the list length. But 11 - (2) is not. Wait, perhaps each non-zero element in the left section is mirrored across5 into the middle section, and also mirrored across11 into the right-right section. But that may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is: for each non-zero element in the left section (positions0-4), insert the central number at position (5 + (5 - x)) and also at (11 + (5 -x)). Similarly for the right section. \n\nFor example, x=2:\n\nmirror across5: 5 + (5-2) =8 \u2192 position8 gets central number.\n\nmirror across11: 11 + (5-2) =14 \u2192 position14 gets central number.\n\nSo in Example0's second row, the2 at position2 leads to8s at8 and14.\n\nYes, that fits. Similarly, in Example0's third input row, the left section has2s at positions1,2,3. Mirroring across5 and11 gives positions9,8,7 and 11+4=15, 11+3=14, 11+2=13. So the output would have8s at7,8,9 (from left mirrors) and13,14,15 (from right mirrors). But in the output, the right section has2s at13,14,15, which are original. So this suggests that the mirroring only applies to the left section, not the right. Wait, but in Example0's third input row, the right section has2s at13,14,15. If mirrored across11, they would create8s in positions9,8,7. So the output would have8s in those positions. But in the output, positions7,8,9 are8s. And the right section's2s remain. So the rule is: left section elements are mirrored into the middle and right-right sections (positions beyond11). But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each non-zero element in the left section (positions0-4), you place the central number at the position mirrored across the first central number (position5) and the second central number (position11). So for x in 0-4, the mirrored positions are (5 + (5 -x)) and (11 + (5 -x)). \n\nFor example, x=2:\n\n5 -x =3 \u2192 mirrored across5 is5+3=8.\n\n11 +3=14.\n\nSo the central number is placed at8 and14.\n\nIn Example0's second row, this is exactly what happens: the2 at2 leads to8s at8 and14.\n\nIn Example1's second row, the1s at1,2,3 in the left section:\n\n5-1=4 \u2192 positions5+4=9 and11+4=15.\n\nSo central number2 is placed at9 and15. But in the output, the row is [0,1,1,1,0,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,2,1,1,0]. So position9 is2, position15 is1. Hmm, this contradicts. So perhaps only the first mirror (across5) is applied for left elements, and the mirror across11 is applied for right elements.\n\nWait, in Example1's second row, the right section has1s at14,15. Mirroring across11:\n\n11 - (14-11)=8 \u2192 position8.\n\n11 - (15-11)=7 \u2192 position7.\n\nSo the1s in the right section (14,15) would lead to2s at7 and8. But in the output row, positions7 and8 are2,2. Which is correct. So the left elements are mirrored across5 into the middle section, and the right elements are mirrored across11 into the middle section. Both left and right non-zero elements contribute to the middle section being filled with the central number. \n\nThus, the pattern is:\n\nFor each row:\n\n- Identify the central numbers (e.g.,8,2,1,9) at positions5 and11.\n\n- For each positionx in the left section (0-4):\n\n   if the value is non-zero, set the value at position (5 + (5 -x)) to the central number.\n\n- For each positiony in the right section (12-16):\n\n   if the value is non-zero, set the value at position (11 - (y -11)) to the central number.\n\nThis way, left elements are mirrored into the middle section (positions6-10), and right elements are mirrored into the middle section as well. \n\nLet's verify this with Example0's third row:\n\nInput: [0,2,2,2,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,2,2,0]\n\nLeft section positions1,2,3 have2s. For each x in1,2,3:\n\n5 + (5 -x) =5+4=9 (x=1), 5+3=8 (x=2), 5+2=7 (x=3). So positions7,8,9 are set to8.\n\nRight section positions13,14,15 have2s. For each y=13,14,15:\n\n11 - (y -11) =11 -2=9 (y=13), 11-3=8 (y=14), 11-4=7 (y=15). So positions7,8,9 are set to8.\n\nIn the output row, positions7,8,9 are8, which matches. \n\nIn Example1's second row:\n\nLeft positions1,2,3 have1s. Mirrors are9,8,7 (set to2).\n\nRight positions14,15 have1s. Mirrors are8,7 (set to2). So positions7,8,9 are2, which matches.\n\nIn Example2's third row:\n\nInput: [0,3,0,3,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nLeft positions1 and3 have3s. Mirrors are9 and7 (set to1).\n\nRight position15 has3. Mirror is7 (11 - (15-11)=7. So position7 is set to1. But in the input, position7 is3. However, in the output row, position7 is3. This is conflicting. Wait, the output row is [0,3,0,3,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,3,0]. So position7 remains3, which suggests that the mirroring only occurs if the target position is0. But that wasn't the case in previous examples.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern might be to add the central number to the mirrored positions regardless of their current value, but in Example2's third row, the mirroring would overwrite position7's3 with1. But the output has3 there, which contradicts. This indicates that my current hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: look for other patterns. Let's consider that the output is generated by taking each non-central number and creating a cross shape around it using the central number. For instance, in Example0's second row, the2 at position2 has8s added to positions8 and14 (mirror across both central numbers). So each non-central number is mirrored across both central numbers, replacing those positions with the central number.\n\nThus, for each non-zero element not at5 or11, mirror it across5 and11, and set those mirrored positions to the central number.\n\nFor example, in Example0's second row, the2 at position2:\n\nMirror across5: position8 \u21928.\n\nMirror across11: position14 \u219214.\n\nSo both positions8 and14 become8.\n\nIn Example0's third row, the2s at1,2,3:\n\nMirror across5: positions9,8,7 \u21928.\n\nMirror across11: positions19,20,21 (out of range) but since the list is length17, maybe only mirrored across5 and11 as follows:\n\nWait, perhaps for any positionx, the mirror across5 is (5 - (x -5)) =10 -x. For example, x=1 \u219210-1=9. x=2\u21928. x=3\u21927. Similarly, mirror across11 is (11 - (x-11))=22 -x. For x=13: 22-13=9. x=14\u21928. x=15\u21927.\n\nSo for each non-zero element at positionx not in5 or11:\n\n- Ifx <5, mirror across5: new position is10 -x. Set to central number.\n\n- Ifx >11, mirror across11: new position is22 -x. Set to central number.\n\nAlso, if the element is in the middle section (6-10), mirror it across5 and11. But in Example0's row8, the input has a2 at position8. Mirror across5: 10-8=2. Mirror across11:22-8=14. So positions2 and14 become8. Which matches the output row8: [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0].\n\nYes, that fits. So the pattern is:\n\nFor each positionx in the input row (except positions5 and11):\n\nIf the value is non-zero, set the mirrored positions (10 -x) and (22 -x) to the central number (the value at positions5 and11).\n\nThis would explain all the examples.\n\nLet's verify:\n\nExample0's second row input: [0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nThe non-zero elements are atx=2,5,11. 5 and11 are central, so ignored. x=2:\n\nmirror across5:10-2=8.\n\nmirror across11:22-2=20 (but list length is17). So 20 is invalid. So perhaps only mirror across5 and11 if the mirrored position is within the list (0-16).\n\nWait, the list has indices0-16. 22-2=20, which is beyond 16. So mirror across11 is only done if the mirrored position is within 0-16.\n\nWait, forx=2:\n\nmirror across5 is8.\n\nmirror across11 is22-2=20, which is out of bounds. So only position8 is set to8.\n\nBut in the output for Example0's second row, the output has8s at8 and14. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirroring is done both ways. For example, mirroringx across5 and across11, regardless of whether it's in the left or right section. So forx in any position except5 and11:\n\nmirror1=10 -x.\n\nmirror2=22 -x.\n\nThen, set those positions to the central number.\n\nBut forx=2:\n\nmirror1=8.\n\nmirror2=20 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo only position8 is set.\n\nBut the output has8 at8 and14. So how does14 come into play?\n\nAh, perhaps the mirroring is done for both central numbers. For example, forx in the left section (x<5):\n\nmirror across5:10 -x.\n\nmirror across11:11 + (5 -x).\n\nBecause the distance fromx to5 is5 -x. Adding that to11 gives11 + (5 -x) =16 -x.\n\nBut 16 -x forx=2 is14. So forx=2, mirror across5 is8 and mirror across11 is14. Both positions are set to8.\n\nYes! That makes sense. So forx in the left section (x<5):\n\nmirror across5: 10 -x.\n\nmirror across11:11 + (5 -x) =16 -x.\n\nForx in the right section (x>11):\n\nmirror across5:5 - (x -5) =10 -x.\n\nmirror across11:11 - (x -11) =22 -x.\n\nBut wait, forx in the middle section (6-10), how is it handled?\n\nForx in the middle section (6-10), mirror across5:10 -x.\n\nmirror across11:22 -x.\n\nFor example, x=8:\n\nmirror across5:10-8=2.\n\nmirror across11:22-8=14.\n\nSo if there's a non-zero element in the middle section, its mirrors are set to the central number. Like in Example0's row8 input has2 at8: output has8s at2 and14.\n\nThis fits.\n\nSo the complete rule is:\n\nFor each element in the input row (excluding positions5 and11), if it's non-zero:\n\n- Compute mirror1 =10 -x (mirror across5).\n\n- Compute mirror2 =16 -x (forx <5) or22 -x (forx >11).\n\nWait, perhaps for anyx except5 and11:\n\nmirror across5 is10 -x.\n\nmirror across11 is22 -x.\n\nBut forx <5, 22 -x would be greater than16 (sincex <5 \u219222 -x >17). So maybe the formula is:\n\nForx in the row (0-16, excluding5 and11):\n\nmirror1 =10 -x.\n\nmirror2 =22 -x.\n\nIf mirror1 is within0-16, set to central number.\n\nIf mirror2 is within0-16, set to central number.\n\nSo forx=2:\n\nmirror1=8 (valid).\n\nmirror2=20 (invalid, since 20>16.\n\nSo only mirror1 is set.\n\nBut in Example0's second row output, there's an8 at14. How does that happen?\n\nWait, maybe the formula for mirror2 is different. Let's re-express:\n\nThe two central numbers are at positions5 and11.\n\nFor any positionx:\n\nmirror across5 is10 -x.\n\nmirror across11 is22 -x.\n\nBut forx <5:\n\nmirror across5 is10 -x.\n\nmirror across11 is11 + (5 -x) =16 -x.\n\nForx >11:\n\nmirror across5 is5 - (x -5) =10 -x.\n\nmirror across11 is11 - (x -11) =22 -x.\n\nForx in 6-10 (middle section):\n\nmirror across5 is10 -x.\n\nmirror across11 is22 -x.\n\nThus, forx=8:\n\nmirror across5 is2.\n\nmirror across11 is14.\n\nBoth valid.\n\nForx=2:\n\nmirror across5 is8.\n\nmirror across11 is14 (16 -2=14).\n\nSo both positions8 and14 are set to8.\n\nIn Example0's second row, x=2, non-zero. So mirror1=8, mirror2=14. Both valid. So output positions8 and14 are8.\n\nYes, that fits. Now, let's verify Example2's third row.\n\nInput row: [0,3,0,3,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nNon-zero positions are1,3,7,15.\n\nForx=1 (left section):\n\nmirror1=10-1=9.\n\nmirror2=16-1=15.\n\nSet positions9 and15 to central number1.\n\nx=3 (left):\n\nmirror1=10-3=7.\n\nmirror2=16-3=13.\n\nSet7 and13 to1.\n\nx=7 (middle section):\n\nmirror1=10-7=3.\n\nmirror2=22-7=15.\n\nSet3 and15 to1.\n\nx=15 (right section):\n\nmirror1=10-15=-5 (invalid).\n\nmirror2=22-15=7.\n\nSet7 to1.\n\nSo for each x:\n\nx=1: set9 and15 to1.\n\nx=3: set7 and13 to1.\n\nx=7: set3 and15 to1.\n\nx=15: set7 to1.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nposition3:1 (fromx=3 andx=7).\n\nposition7:1 (fromx=3 andx=15 andx=7? But in the input row, x=7 is3. So after transformation, position7 should be set to1. But in the output row for Example2's third row, position7 is3. This contradicts.\n\nWait, in Example2's third row input has3 atx=7. According to the rule, sincex=7 is non-zero, we set its mirrors to1. So position3 and15 become1. But in the output, position3 is3 (original value), and position15 is3. So this suggests the rule is not being followed here, indicating an error in the hypothesis.\n\nThis suggests that there's a different pattern. Maybe the transformation only applies to elements in the left and right sections, not the middle section. So forx <5 orx>11.\n\nLet's re-express the rule:\n\nFor each non-zero element at positionx:\n\n- Ifx is in the left section (x<5), compute mirror1=10-x and mirror2=16-x. Set those positions to the central number.\n\n- Ifx is in the right section (x>11), compute mirror1=10-x and mirror2=22-x. Set those positions to the central number.\n\n- Middle section (6-10) elements are left as-is.\n\nSo for Example2's third row:\n\nx=1 (left): mirror1=9, mirror2=15 \u2192 set9 and15 to1.\n\nx=3 (left): mirror1=7, mirror2=13 \u2192 set7 and13 to1.\n\nx=7 (middle): left as-is.\n\nx=15 (right): mirror1=10-15=-5 (invalid), mirror2=22-15=7 \u2192 set7 to1.\n\nSo after processing:\n\nposition7: set to1 byx=3 andx=15.\n\nposition9: set to1 byx=1.\n\nposition13: set to1 byx=3.\n\nposition15: set to1 byx=1.\n\nBut the input row's output is [0,3,0,3,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,3,0]. \n\nSo position7 is3 (not set to1), position9 is1, position13 is1, position15 is3. \n\nThis suggests that middle section elements are not processed. So the rule applies only to left and right sections.\n\nThus, forx in left or right sections:\n\n- if non-zero, compute mirrors and set to central number.\n\nMiddle section elements are not processed, so their values remain as in the input.\n\nIn Example2's third row, x=7 is in the middle section, so it's not processed. Thus, the mirrors fromx=3 (left) would set position7 to1. But the input has3 at position7. So in the output, it would be1. But in the actual output, position7 is3. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, my current hypothesis is incorrect. I must find another pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: Looking at the outputs, it seems like the pattern is to create a symmetrical pattern around the two central numbers. Each non-zero element in the left or right sections leads to the central number being placed in specific positions, forming a diamond or cross shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each non-zero element in the input is replaced by the central number in the output, but this doesn't fit because the original elements are still present.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the2s are still present. Only the mirrored positions are filled with8s. So it's not replacing, but adding.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs seem to have the same structure as the inputs but with additional central numbers placed in the middle section. The middle section (between the two central numbers) is being filled with the central number wherever there were non-zero elements in the left or right sections.\n\nThus, for each non-zero element in the left or right sections, place the central number in the middle section at a position that's mirrored from the original. \n\nFor left section elements (0-4), their mirrored position in the middle section is10 -x. For right section elements (12-16), their mirrored position in the middle section is22 -x. \n\nFor example, left x=2:10-2=8. So middle section position8 is set to central number.\n\nRight x=14:22-14=8. So position8 is set.\n\nThus, the middle section is a combination of mirrors from left and right.\n\nIn Example0's second row, the left x=2 leads to position8 being8. The output row has8 at8.\n\nIn Example0's third row, left x=1,2,3 lead to positions9,8,7 being8. Right x=13,14,15 lead to positions9,8,7 being8. So middle section positions7,8,9 are8.\n\nIn Example1's second row, left x=1,2,3 lead to positions9,8,7 being2. Right x=14,15 lead to positions8,7 being2. So positions7,8,9 are2,2,2.\n\nThis seems to fit. The middle section is filled with the central number at positions mirrored from the left and right sections.\n\nThus, the rule is:\n\nFor each non-zero element in the left section (0-4):\n\n- compute position mirrored across5 as10 -x.\n\n- set that position in the middle section to central number.\n\nFor each non-zero element in the right section (12-16):\n\n- compute position mirrored across11 as22 -x.\n\n- set that position in the middle section to central number.\n\nThus, the middle section positions6-10 are filled with central numbers based on the non-zero elements in the left and right sections.\n\nThis explains all examples.\n\nIn Example0's row8, the middle section has a2 at position8. Since it's in the middle section, it's not mirrored, so it remains. The output's middle section has2 at8, and8s at positions2 and14 from other elements.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input's second row: [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nCentral number is9.\n\nLeft section positions1,2,3 have4s. For each x=1,2,3:\n\nmirror across5:10 -1=9,10-2=8,10-3=7.\n\nSet positions7,8,9 to9.\n\nRight section has no non-zero elements (positions12-16 are0).\n\nAdditionally, the middle section has4s at7 and8. According to the rule, these are not processed (only left and right sections are). So in the output, positions7,8,9 become9,9,9. The existing4s in7 and8 are overwritten with9.\n\nThus, the second row becomes:\n\n[0,4,4,4,0,9,0,9,9,9,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nSimilarly, the third row of test input is [0,4,0,4,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nLeft section positions1 and3 have4s. Their mirrors are9 and7. So positions7 and9 are set to9. So the third row becomes:\n\n[0,4,0,4,0,9,0,9,0,9,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nThe eighth row of test input is [0,4,0,4,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]. This is the same as the third row, so output is similar.\n\nThe ninth row of test input is [0,0,4,0,0,9,0,4,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nLeft section has4 at position2. Mirror across5:10-2=8. So position8 becomes9.\n\nRight section has4s at7 and8 (middle section), so they are not processed. So the ninth row becomes:\n\n[0,0,4,0,0,9,0,4,9,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nWait, but according to the rule, only left and right sections are processed. The middle section's4s are at7 and8. They are not part of the left or right sections, so they remain. But the left section's4 at position2 causes position8 to be set to9. So position8's4 is overwritten to9. So the ninth row output is:\n\n[0,0,4,0,0,9,0,4,9,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut according to the training examples, when there's a non-zero in the middle section, it's possible for it to be overwritten by the mirroring from the left or right sections. \n\nThe test input's fourteenth row is [0,0,0,0,0,9,0,4,0,4,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nLeft section has4s at positions7 and9 in the middle section? No, left section is0-4. The4s are at7 and9, which are in the middle section. So according to the rule, they are not processed. But the row is in the test input's fourteenth row, which is:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,9,0,4,0,4,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nThe left section (0-4) has0s, so no mirrors. The right section (12-16) has0s. Thus, no changes. But according to the training examples, such as Example0's row8, the middle section's non-zero elements are left as-is unless mirrored from other positions. So in this row, the4s at7 and9 remain. However, in the output, these might be mirrored from other sections. Wait, no. Since there are no non-zero elements in the left or right sections, the middle section remains as-is. So the output for this row would be the same as the input. But according to the pattern, this row's output should have9s mirrored from left or right sections. But since there are none, it remains the same. However, looking at the training examples, when there are non-zero elements in the middle section, they are left as-is unless mirrored from other sections. \n\nBut according to the rule, middle section elements are not processed. So in the fourteenth row of the test input, the4s at7 and9 remain. But according to the training examples, when there's a non-zero in the middle section, like in Example0's row8, the output retains the2 in the middle section and adds8s in the left and right sections. \n\nThus, applying the rule to the test input:\n\nEach row's left and right sections' non-zero elements are mirrored into the middle section as the central number (9). Middle section elements are left as-is unless overwritten by the mirroring.\n\nSo let's process each row of the test input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 no non-zero in left/right. Output same.\n\nRow1: [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,4,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLeft section1-3:4s. Mirrors7,8,9 \u2192 set to9. So output: [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,9,9,9,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow2: [0,4,0,4,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLeft section1 and3:4s. Mirrors9 and7 \u2192 set to9. Output: [0,4,0,4,0,9,0,9,0,9,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow3: [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSame as row1, output: [0,4,4,4,0,9,0,9,9,9,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 same as row0.\n\nRow5: [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9] \u2192 all9s.\n\nRow6: same as row0.\n\nRow7: [0,0,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLeft section position2:4. Mirror10-2=8 \u2192 set8 to9. Output: [0,0,4,0,0,9,0,0,9,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow8: [0,4,0,4,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLeft positions1 and3:4s. Mirrors9 and7 \u2192 set to9. Output: [0,4,0,4,0,9,0,9,0,9,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow9: [0,0,4,0,0,9,0,4,4,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLeft position2:4. Mirror8 \u2192 set8 to9. Output: [0,0,4,0,0,9,0,4,9,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow10: same as row0.\n\nRow11: all9s.\n\nRow12: same as row0.\n\nRow13: same as row0.\n\nRow14: [0,0,0,0,0,9,0,4,0,4,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLeft and right sections have0s. Middle section4s at7 and9. No changes. Output same as input.\n\nRow15: [0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 same as row0.\n\nRow16: same as row0.\n\nThus, the final output for the test input would have the middle sections filled with9s where the left and right sections had4s.",
