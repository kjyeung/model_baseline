        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The goal is to find the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices in the training examples and then apply that pattern to the test input. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the training examples to understand the pattern. Let's start with Example 0. \n\nIn Example 0's input, there's a central 3x3 block of 4s with a 6 in the center. The output expands this structure. The original 4s form a diamond shape, and the output adds layers around it. The 6 in the center becomes a 4, and surrounding cells are 6s. Wait, maybe it's a different approach. Let me visualize both input and output.\n\nOriginal input has:\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0]\nRow 4: [0,0,0,4,6,4,0,0,0,0]\nRow 5: [0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput for rows 2-6 becomes:\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [0,0,4,6,6,6,4,0,0,0]\nRow4: [0,0,4,6,4,6,4,0,0,0]\nRow5: [0,0,4,6,6,6,4,0,0,0]\nRow6: [0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the original 3x3 block (4s and 6) is expanded into a 5x5 diamond shape. The 6 is now surrounded by more 6s, and there's a layer of 4s around that. Also, the center of the output in row4, column4 is 4, which was the original 6. Hmm, maybe there's a kernel or convolution happening here. Like each cell is being replaced by the sum or some operation of its neighbors?\n\nWait, another thought: the output seems to create a border around the original shape, but the numbers are changing. Let's check Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1's input, there's a structure of 2s forming a square with 7s inside. The output expands that. For instance, the input's rows 3-6 are 2s and 7s. The output shows that the 7s are now in a larger area, surrounded by 2s. The original 7s become a 2 in the center of their block. So, perhaps the pattern is to take the original structure and expand each cell's value outward, creating a sort of outline, and the inner cells are replaced with the surrounding values.\n\nAnother possibility is that the transformation is creating a sort of outline by adding layers around the original non-zero cells, replacing the original cells with a lower value and the new surrounding cells with higher values. Wait, but in Example 0, the original 4s become 6s in the output's surrounding, and the center becomes 4 again. Wait, no: original center was 6, output center is 4. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait in Example 0 input, the center cell (row4, column5) is 6. In the output, the same position (row4, column5) is 4. That's interesting. So the original 6 becomes 4, and the surrounding cells (which were 4s) become 6s. So maybe there's a swap of values, but only for certain cells. Alternatively, perhaps each cell is replaced by the sum or maximum of its neighbors. Or maybe it's a diamond-shaped expansion where each original cell is replaced by a diamond of a higher number, and the center is the original number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a kind of \"outline\" where each original cell's value is used to create a cross or diamond around it, and overlapping areas get a higher value. But looking at Example 0: the original 4s form a cross. The output turns that into a diamond. The center 6 becomes a 4 in the output, surrounded by 6s. Wait, that's the opposite. Maybe the process is that each cell in the input is the center of a diamond in the output, using the original cell's value as the new surrounding. For instance, the 4s in the input would generate a diamond of 4s around their position in the output. Then, where multiple diamonds overlap, the value is summed or takes the maximum. But how does that explain the 6 turning into 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a transformation where each non-zero cell in the input creates a cross or diamond shape in the output, but with a shift. For example, in Example 0's input, the 4s are in a horizontal line. The output has a diamond shape, which could be a combination of horizontal and vertical expansions. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: the 2s form a border around the 7s. The output's 7s are expanded outward, and there are more 2s around them. The original 7s become 2 in the output's center. Wait, in the input, the 7s are in the center of a 2x2 block. In the output, those cells are now 2s, and the 7s are in a larger area around them. So perhaps the output is inverting the layers. The inner cells become the outer layer's value, and the outer layer becomes the inner value. Or maybe expanding each cell's value outward, creating a sort of outline, and then the original cell's value is replaced by a lower value.\n\nAnother angle: Each non-zero cell in the input is generating a diamond shape in the output. The size of the diamond depends on the value. For example, a 4 in the input creates a 3x3 diamond in the output (maybe), and a 6 creates a smaller diamond. But this seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by applying a dilation or erosion morphological operation. In image processing, dilation expands the regions of pixels, which could be similar to what's happening here. For instance, each non-zero cell is expanded by one layer in all directions, but with a specific value. However, the values in the output aren't the same as the input. For example, in Example 0, the 4s in the input become 6s in the output, which suggests that the value might be increasing when expanded.\n\nWait, let's take the first example. The input has 4s and a 6. The output has 4s and 6s arranged in a diamond. The original 6 is now a 4, and the surrounding 4s are now 6s. So maybe each cell's value is replaced by the average or some combination of its neighbors. Alternatively, perhaps the operation is to take the maximum value in the neighborhood. For instance, each cell in the output is the maximum of the 3x3 area around the corresponding input cell. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the cell at (4,5) is 6. If we take the 3x3 neighborhood around it (rows 3-5, columns 4-6), the max is 6. But in the output, that cell becomes 4. That doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: looking for symmetry. The outputs in the examples have a certain symmetry. For example, in Example 0, the output is a diamond shape. The input is a smaller diamond. So maybe the transformation is expanding the shape in all directions by one layer, replacing the new outer layer with the original outer value. But in Example 0, the original 4s are in a horizontal line, but the output's diamond has vertical expansion as well. That might suggest that the input's shape is being rotated or mirrored.\n\nWait, looking at the input of Example 0: the 4s form a horizontal line in rows 3-5, but the output's diamond includes vertical expansion. Maybe the pattern is to take each cell and create a cross (horizontal and vertical) around it. For instance, each non-zero cell in the input creates a plus sign in the output. Then overlapping plus signs combine. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the original 4s are in a horizontal line. If each 4 in the input creates a vertical and horizontal line of 4s in the output, then overlapping would form a diamond. For example, the middle 4 in row4 would create a plus sign. The 4s above and below would add to that. Then the 6 in the center, perhaps, is a different case.\n\nBut the output has 6s around the center. So maybe the 6 in the input causes a different expansion. Alternatively, maybe the 6 is a higher value that affects neighboring cells. This is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLet me try to think of the layers. In Example 0's output, the center is 4, surrounded by 6s, then 4s again. The original input had a 6 in the center. So maybe the output is a kernel applied where each cell is replaced by the sum of its neighbors multiplied by some factor. Alternatively, maybe the transformation is shifting the original cells outward and then combining with the original.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of the original shape and its mirror. For example, if the input is a horizontal line, the output is the original plus a vertical line, forming a cross, which when combined with neighboring cells creates a diamond.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output seems to be a larger version of the input's structure, but with more layers. For example, in Example 0, the input's 3x3 block becomes a 5x5 diamond. Similarly, Example 1's input's 4x4 block becomes a larger structure. The numbers in the output are higher in some areas and lower in others. \n\nWait, in Example 0, the input has 4s and a 6. The output has 4s in the outer layer, 6s in the middle layer, and a 4 in the center. So the original 6 becomes 4, and the original 4s become 6s. That's a swap. But why? Maybe the layers are being inverted. The outermost layer in the input becomes the inner layer in the output, and vice versa. But how does that work with the numbers?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers could represent layers. For example, 4 is the outer layer, 6 is the next layer in, and then 4 again. But that doesn't quite fit.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the positions of non-zero cells in input and output.\n\nIn Example 0, the input's non-zero cells are in rows 3-5, columns 4-6. The output's non-zero cells are in rows 2-6, columns 3-7. So the structure expands outward by one cell in all directions. The values change such that the original 4s (forming a cross) become a diamond of 6s with a 4 in the center. Wait, but the original center was 6, which becomes 4. So perhaps the transformation is that each cell is replaced by the sum of its neighbors, but with some modulo or other operation.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each cell in the output is the sum of its neighboring cells in the input. Let's test that for the center cell in Example 0's output. The original input's cell (4,5) is 6. In the output, cell (4,5) is 4. The neighbors of (4,5) in the input would be the cells around it. Let's see: in the input, the cell (4,5) is surrounded by 4s (up, down, left, right) and 0s elsewhere. So sum of neighbors would be 4 (up) +4 (down) +4 (left) +4 (right) + others 0. Sum is 16. But 16 mod something? The output cell is 4. 16/4 =4. So maybe each output cell is the sum of its neighbors in the input divided by 4. That would give 16/4=4. Hmm, that could fit. Let's check another cell.\n\nTake the output cell (3,4) in Example 0, which is 6. In the input, the neighbors of (3,4) would be the cells around it. Let's see: input cell (3,4) is 4. Its neighbors would be cells (2,4)=0, (4,4)=6, (3,3)=0, (3,5)=4. Wait, but summing the neighbors: up (row2, column4)=0, down (row4, column4)=6, left (row3, column3)=0, right (row3, column5)=4. Then sum is 0+6+0+4=10. If divided by 10/ (some divisor), but the output is 6. 10 divided by something doesn't give 6. So that might not be it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell is the maximum value of its neighboring cells in the input. Let's see. For output cell (4,5)=4, the neighbors in the input would be the original cell (4,5) itself? Wait, maybe the output is generated by taking the original cell and its neighbors, then applying a function. For example, the output cell is the average of the cell and its neighbors. But in this case, the original cell (4,5) is 6. Its neighbors are 4,4,4,4. So average would be (6 +4*4)/5 = (6+16)/5=22/5=4.4, which rounds down to 4. That matches the output. For the output cell (3,4)=6, which would correspond to the input cell (3,4)=4. The neighbors of (3,4) in the input: up (2,4)=0, down (4,4)=6, left (3,3)=0, right (3,5)=4. The average would be (4 +0+6+0+4)/5=14/5=2.8, which rounds to 3. But the output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the output cell is the sum of the cell and its neighbors. For the center cell (4,5), input cell is 6. Sum with neighbors (4,4)=4, (4,6)=4, (3,5)=4, (5,5)=4. Sum is 6 +4+4+4+4=22. Not sure how that becomes 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a convolution with a specific kernel. For example, applying a kernel that detects edges or some feature. But without knowing the kernel, it's hard to guess.\n\nLooking at Example 1. Input has 2s surrounding 7s. The output has 7s forming a larger square with 2s around them, and the original 7s are now 2s. For instance, in the input, row4, column5 is 7. In the output, that cell is 2. The surrounding cells are 7s. So again, the original cell's value is replaced by a lower number, and the surrounding cells are increased. So perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero cell in the input is replaced by the next lower number, and the surrounding cells are set to the original cell's value. For example, a 6 becomes 4, and the surrounding cells become 6. Then overlapping areas would take the higher value.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. Take Example 0's input. The center cell is 6. According to this idea, it becomes 4, and the four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) become 6. But in the output, the cells around the center are 6s. The original 4s would become 2s, and their neighbors (which were 0s) would become 4s. But in the output, the outer layer is 4s. So if each original cell's value is decreased by 2 and then the neighboring cells are set to the original value, maybe.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the original 4s are replaced by 6s in the output. But according to this idea, they would be replaced by 4-2=2, and neighbors set to 4. But that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is generated by taking each non-zero cell in the input and creating a diamond-shaped structure around it, where the size of the diamond depends on the cell's value. For example, a cell with value 4 creates a 3x3 diamond, a cell with 6 creates a larger diamond, but overlapping diamonds might take the maximum value.\n\nBut in Example 0, the 6 in the input is at the center. If a 6 creates a 5x5 diamond, but in the output, the 6s are in a 3x3 cross around the center. This doesn't align.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output seems to have layers. For instance, in Example 0, the output layers are 4, 6, 4. The center is 4, surrounded by 6, then 4 again. Similarly, in Example 1, the layers are 2,7,2. The original 7s are now in a larger area with 2s around. So maybe the transformation is creating a border around the original shape, and the border's value is the original cell's value minus 2. Then, the original cells are filled with the value minus 2. But in Example 0, the original 4s would become 4-2=2, but in the output, they become 6. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the border is created by adding 2 to the original value. Original 4s become 6 in the border, and the original center 6 becomes 4. So it's like swapping the layers. The center becomes outer value minus 2, and the outer becomes center plus 2. Not sure.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is the input's structure expanded by one layer, and each layer alternates between two values. For example, in Example 0, the original structure is 4s with a 6 in the center. The output adds a layer of 6s around it, then a layer of 4s. But the original 6 becomes a 4. Maybe the center value decreases by 2, and each surrounding layer increases by 2.\n\nBut in Example 1, the original 7s are in the center. The output's center is 2, and the surrounding layer is 7. So 7 decreases by 5 to 2, which doesn't fit a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the value of the new layer is the original value minus something. For example, in Example 0, the original 4s are the outer layer, and the new outer layer is 4+2=6, then the new center is 4 (original 6-2=4). In Example 1, the original outer layer is 2, new outer layer is 2+5=7, and the new center is 2 (original 7-5=2). But 5 is arbitrary here. Not a clear pattern.\n\nLet me try to look for a different pattern. In all training examples, the output's non-zero regions are larger than the input's. The numbers seem to alternate between two values. For example, in Example 0, input has 4 and 6. Output has 4 and 6. The center of the output is 4, which was the original 6. The surrounding layers are 6s, which were original 4s. So perhaps each number is swapped with another. Like 4 and 6 are swapped in their positions, but only in certain areas.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is a rotation or reflection. For Example 0, the input's horizontal line becomes a diamond, which could be a rotation. But rotation wouldn't change the values. So probably not.\n\nWait, considering the layers again. The output for each example has a symmetrical pattern where the original shape is expanded, and the values are swapped between the layers. For instance, in Example 0:\n\nOriginal layers (from outer to inner):\nLayer 1 (outer): 4\nLayer 2 (inner): 6\n\nOutput layers:\nLayer 1 (outer): 4\nLayer 2 (middle):6\nLayer3 (inner):4\n\nSo the layers alternate between 4 and 6. Similarly, in Example1:\n\nInput layers:\nLayer1 (outer):2\nLayer2 (inner):7\n\nOutput layers:\nLayer1 (outer):2\nLayer2:7\nLayer3:2\n\nAgain, alternating. Example2:\n\nInput:\nLayer1:3\nLayer2:1\n\nOutput:\nLayer1:3\nLayer2:1\nLayer3:3\n\nSo the pattern is that each layer in the input adds another layer in the output, alternating between the two values. The innermost layer of the input becomes the next layer in the output. For example, in Example0, the input has two layers (4 and 6). The output adds another layer of 4 around it. Wait, but the output's center is 4, which was the input's 6. So perhaps each layer is shifted inward, and a new layer is added around.\n\nAlternatively, the number of layers increases by one, and the values alternate. So if the input has n layers, the output has n+1 layers, alternating the original values.\n\nBut how does that work with the values? For example, in Example0, input has two values:4 and6. The output has three layers:4,6,4. So it's adding a layer of 4 around. But how? The original 6 is now the middle layer (value 4?), which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by taking the original structure and adding a layer of the first value (the outer layer's value) around it, and the inner layers shift. For example, in Example0, the original structure is 4 surrounding a 6. The output adds a layer of 4 around, making the layers 4,6,4. But the original 6 is now 4. So perhaps the inner layer's value is replaced by the outer layer's value minus 2. 4-2=2, but no. Original 6 becomes 4, which is 6-2=4. That fits. Then the new outer layer is 4, and the middle layer is 6 (original 4+2=6). Wait, this could be the pattern. Each layer in the output is the previous layer's value plus 2 for the middle layer, and the original inner layer is decreased by 2.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nOriginal outer layer:4, inner layer:6.\n\nOutput layers:\n\nNew outer layer:4 (same as original outer)\n\nMiddle layer:4+2=6\n\nNew inner layer:6-2=4\n\nSo yes, this fits. \n\nIn Example1:\n\nOriginal outer layer:2, inner layer:7.\n\nOutput layers:\n\nOuter layer:2\n\nMiddle layer:2+5=7\n\nInner layer:7-5=2\n\nThat fits the numbers. Example1's output has 2,7,2 layers.\n\nExample2:\n\nOriginal outer layer:3, inner layer:1.\n\nOutput layers:\n\nOuter layer:3\n\nMiddle layer:3+ (-2) =1? Wait, 3-2=1. Then inner layer:1+2=3. Hmm, but that's inconsistent. Let me check Example2's input and output.\n\nExample2's input has outer layer 3 and inner layer 1. Output layers are 3,1,3. So according to the pattern:\n\nOriginal outer:3 \u2192 new outer:3\n\nMiddle layer:3 + (something) =1 \u2192 which would need 3 -2 =1\n\nInner layer:1 + (something) =3 \u2192 1+2=3.\n\nSo the pattern here is adding and subtracting 2. But why in Example1 it's adding 5 and subtracting 5? Because 7-5=2 and 2+5=7. So the delta is 5 in that case. This inconsistency suggests that the delta depends on the original values. For Example0: 4 and 6 have a delta of 2. Example1: 2 and7 have a delta of5. Example2:3 and1 have a delta of -2.\n\nHmm, this seems inconsistent. Maybe the delta is the difference between the two original layers. For Example0:6-4=2, so delta is 2. Example1:7-2=5. Example2:1-3= -2. So the delta is the inner value minus the outer value. Then, in the output, the middle layer is outer + delta, and the inner layer is inner - delta. But let's see.\n\nFor Example0:\n\ndelta =6-4=2.\n\nOutput middle layer:4+2=6.\n\nOutput inner layer:6-2=4. Correct.\n\nExample1:\n\ndelta=7-2=5.\n\nOutput middle layer:2+5=7.\n\nOutput inner layer:7-5=2. Correct.\n\nExample2:\n\ndelta=1-3= -2.\n\nOutput middle layer:3 + (-2)=1.\n\nOutput inner layer:1 - (-2)=3. Correct.\n\nYes, this fits. So the pattern is:\n\n- The input has two layers: an outer layer with value A and an inner layer with value B.\n\n- The output adds a new layer around the input structure, resulting in three layers:\n\n   - The outermost layer remains A.\n\n   - The middle layer is A + (B - A) = B.\n\n   - The innermost layer is B - (B - A) = A.\n\nWait, but in the examples, the innermost layer is A, which is the original outer value. So the transformation is creating a new structure where the layers alternate between A and B, starting with A in the outer layer. The middle layer is B, and the new innermost layer is A again. But how is this done spatially?\n\nFor Example0, the input is a cross of 4s with a single 6 in the center. The output becomes a diamond where the layers are 4 (outer), 6 (middle), and 4 (center). So the original structure is expanded by adding a layer of B (6) around the original inner layer, but according to this delta pattern, it's more about creating a new innermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is:\n\n1. Take the original shape, which has an outer layer A and inner layer B.\n\n2. Create a new structure where:\n\n   a. The outermost layer is A.\n\n   b. The middle layer is B (original inner).\n\n   c. The new innermost layer is A again.\n\nBut how does this expansion work spatially?\n\nAlternatively, the process is to take each cell in the input and generate a new cell in the output that is shifted outward by one layer, using the original value. Then, the original cells are filled with the original inner value minus delta. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother angle: The output is a combination of two layers: the original structure expanded outward and inward. Let's look at the positions.\n\nFor Example0's input, the original 4s form a cross. The output's 6s form a diamond around the original cross, and the center is 4. So perhaps the 6s are the original 4s shifted outward by one cell in all directions, forming a diamond, and the center is the original 6 shifted down by 2 (from 6 to 4). Similarly, in Example1, the original 2s are shifted outward to form a larger square, and the original 7s become 2s in the center.\n\nThis suggests that each cell in the input is shifted outward by one cell in all directions to form a larger shape, and the original cell's value is decreased by a certain amount. The amount by which the value is decreased might be the difference between the original outer and inner values.\n\nFor Example0: original 4s become 6s in the output's middle layer. The original delta is 6-4=2. So the shifted cells (original outer layer) increase by delta. The original inner layer (6) becomes 6 - delta =4.\n\nIn Example1: original outer layer 2, inner 7. delta=5. Shifted outer becomes 2+5=7. Original inner becomes 7-5=2.\n\nExample2: original outer 3, inner1. delta=-2. shifted outer becomes3 + (-2)=1. inner becomes1 - (-2)=3.\n\nYes, this fits. So the pattern is:\n\nFor each cell in the input's outer layer (A), when expanded outward, the value becomes A + (B - A) = B. The inner layer (B) becomes B - (B - A) = A.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\n1. Expand the outer layer outward by one cell in all directions, changing their value to B.\n\n2. Change the inner layer's value to A.\n\n3. Add a new outer layer around the entire structure with the original outer value A.\n\nWait, but looking at Example0's output, the outer layer is 4, middle layer is6, inner layer is4. So the original outer layer (4) is expanded outward, but in the output, the outermost layer is still 4, the next layer is6, then 4. That suggests that the original structure is surrounded by a new layer of A, and the existing layers are transformed to B and A.\n\nAlternatively, the steps are:\n\n- Take the original outer layer (A) and expand it by one cell in all directions to form a new layer around it, with value B.\n\n- The original outer layer becomes the new middle layer with value B.\n\n- The original inner layer (B) becomes the new innermost layer with value A.\n\nBut how does this expansion work spatially?\n\nLet's consider Example0's input:\n\nOriginal outer layer is the 4s forming a horizontal line. When expanded outward by one cell in all directions (up, down, left, right), the new layer would form a diamond shape. The new layer's value is B=6. But wait, the original inner value was 6, so B=6. Then the new layer around the original outer 4s is set to 6. The original 4s become the middle layer, and their value is changed to 6. Wait, no. Because the output's middle layer is 6, which corresponds to the original outer layer's position. The original inner layer (6) becomes the new center with value4. So perhaps:\n\n- The original outer layer's cells are shifted outward to create a new layer with value B. \n\n- The original outer layer's positions are now filled with B.\n\n- The original inner layer's cells are changed to A.\n\nBut how does shifting outward work? For each cell in the original outer layer, create new cells in all adjacent positions (up, down, left, right, diagonals?), but this depends on the structure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by creating a new structure where each cell from the input's outer layer is replaced with B, and the surrounding cells are also set to B. The inner layer's cells are replaced with A. And a new outer layer of A is added around everything.\n\nThis is getting a bit vague. Let's try to model it step by step.\n\nTake Example0's input:\n\nThe original structure is a horizontal line of 4s (layer A=4) and a center cell of 6 (layer B=6).\n\nThe output has three layers:\n\n- Outer layer:4\n\n- Middle layer:6\n\n- Inner layer:4\n\nSo the original A and B are now arranged as A-B-A.\n\nThe expansion from input to output is adding a new outer layer of A, turning the original A into B, and the original B into A.\n\nSo the pattern is: when expanding, the existing layers are alternated, and a new layer of the original outer value is added around.\n\nSo for Example0:\n\nOriginal layers (A=4, B=6) \u2192 Output layers (A=4, B=6, A=4).\n\nFor Example1:\n\nOriginal layers (A=2, B=7) \u2192 Output layers (2,7,2).\n\nFor Example2:\n\nOriginal layers (A=3, B=1) \u2192 Output layers (3,1,3).\n\nSo the pattern is to add a new outer layer of A, and alternate the existing layers.\n\nBut how does this work spatially? Let's look at the positions.\n\nIn Example0's input, the 4s are in rows 3-5, columns4-6 (forming a horizontal line). The output's 4s are in a diamond shape that's larger. The 6s form a diamond around the original structure. The center 6 becomes 4. \n\nThis suggests that the transformation is to take the original outer layer (A), expand it into a diamond shape (adding cells in all directions to form a diamond), set those new cells to B, and then set the original A cells to B and the original B cells to A. Then add a new outer layer of A around the entire structure.\n\nBut how is the expansion done?\n\nPerhaps for each cell in the original structure's outer layer (A), you create new cells in all adjacent positions (up, down, left, right, diagonals) to form a diamond, and set those to B. Then, the original A cells become B, and the original B cells become A. Then, surround the entire structure with a layer of A.\n\nBut this is getting complex. Let's think of it as a kernel applied to each cell.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to create a new matrix where each cell is determined by the maximum value in a certain pattern around the original cell. For example, if a cell in the input is A, then in the output, the cell and its neighbors are set to B, and so on.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the Test Input.\n\nThe test input has two structures. The first is an 8s triangle in the top-left corner. The second is an 8s square in the bottom-right. Let's see:\n\nFirst structure (rows 1-3, columns 1-3):\n\nRow1: 8,8,8\n\nRow2:8,3,8\n\nRow3:8,8,8\n\nThis forms a square with 8s surrounding a 3.\n\nSecond structure (rows6-9, columns6-9):\n\nRow6:8,8,8,8\n\nRow7:8,3,3,8\n\nRow8:8,3,3,8\n\nRow9:8,8,8,8\n\nThis is a larger square of 8s with 3s inside.\n\nAccording to the pattern observed in the training examples, each of these structures should be transformed into a larger structure with alternating layers. \n\nFor the first structure (8 surrounding 3):\n\nOriginal layers are A=8 (outer) and B=3 (inner). The delta is B - A =3-8= -5. So the output should have layers:\n\nOuter layer:8 (original A)\n\nMiddle layer:8 + (-5) =3\n\nInner layer:3 - (-5)=8\n\nSo the transformed structure would have an outer layer of 8, middle of3, inner of8. But spatially, how? The original structure is a 3x3 square. The output should expand it. For example, the original 3x3 becomes a 5x5 structure. The outer layer is8, middle layer3, inner layer8.\n\nSimilarly, the second structure in the test input is a 4x4 square of8s with a 2x2 of3s inside. The layers are A=8 (outer), B=3 (inner). The delta is3-8=-5. So the output layers would be 8 (outer),3 (middle),8 (inner).\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFor the first structure (top-left):\n\nOriginal 3x3 8s with 3 center. Output should be a 5x5 structure with outer 8, middle3, inner8.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nRow0:0s\n\nRow1:0,8,8,8,0,...\n\nRow2:8,3,3,3,8,...\n\nRow3:8,3,8,3,8,...\n\nRow4:0,8,8,8,0,...\n\nSimilarly for the second structure (bottom-right), which is larger. It's a 4x4 square of 8s with 3s inside. The output should expand to 6x6, with layers 8,3,8.\n\nBut given the test input is a 12x12 matrix, the output should expand each structure by two layers around (since training examples added one layer and the test input structures are larger).\n\nWait, the training examples added one layer. For example, Example0's input was 3x3, output 5x5. So each dimension increases by 2 (adding one layer around). The test input's first structure is 3x3, so output would be 5x5. The second structure is 4x4, so output would be 6x6.\n\nBut let's focus on the pattern of the layers. For each structure:\n\n- Original outer layer (A) is expanded outward by one layer, set to A.\n\n- Original outer layer's cells are set to B (A + delta = A + (B - A) = B).\n\n- Original inner layer (B) is set to A.\n\nSo for the first structure:\n\nOriginal A=8, B=3. delta=3-8=-5.\n\nOutput layers:\n\nOuter layer:8 (newly added around)\n\nMiddle layer:8 + (-5)=3\n\nInner layer:3 - (-5)=8\n\nSo spatially, the structure becomes:\n\nRow1 (original row0 in test input? Let's check the test input's rows:\n\nTest input has 12 rows (0-11). The first structure is at rows1-3 (0-indexed), columns1-3. \n\nThe output should have this structure expanded. The new outer layer is 8. The middle layer is3. The inner layer is8.\n\nSo the transformed structure would be:\n\nRow0:0s\n\nRow1:0,8,8,8,0,...\n\nRow2:8,3,3,3,8,...\n\nRow3:8,3,8,3,8,...\n\nRow4:8,3,3,3,8,...\n\nRow5:0,8,8,8,0,...\n\nWait, but the original structure is a 3x3 square. Expanding by one layer in all directions would make it 5x5. The center cell (row2, column2 in the test input) was 3. In the output, it should become 8. The surrounding cells (original 8s) become3. The new outer layer is8.\n\nBut this is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to construct the output step by step.\n\nFor the first structure (3x3 8s with 3 center):\n\nOriginal cells:\n\n(1,1)=8, (1,2)=8, (1,3)=8\n\n(2,1)=8, (2,2)=3, (2,3)=8\n\n(3,1)=8, (3,2)=8, (3,3)=8\n\nIn the output, this becomes a 5x5 structure centered at (2,2). The layers are:\n\nOuter layer (new) \u21928.\n\nMiddle layer (original outer 8s transformed to3.\n\nInner layer (original center3 transformed to8.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\nRows0-4 (assuming 0-indexed):\n\nRow0: all 0s except possibly the new layer.\n\nBut in the test input, the original structure starts at row1. Expanding outward, the new rows affected would be row0 and row4. Similarly for columns.\n\nThe transformed structure would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,...] except maybe column1-3?\n\nWait, perhaps the exact positions depend on how the expansion is done. Alternatively, the output for each structure is created by:\n\n- Adding a layer of A (8) around the original structure.\n\n- Changing the original A cells to B (3).\n\n- Changing the original B cells to A (8).\n\nSo the first structure's output would have:\n\nOriginal structure expanded by one cell in all directions, filled with8.\n\nThen, the original positions (now one layer inward) are set to3.\n\nThe original center (3) is set to8.\n\nSo the transformed structure would be:\n\nRows0-4, columns0-4:\n\nRow0: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,...\n\nRow1:0,8,8,8,8,0,...\n\nRow2:0,8,3,3,3,8,0,...\n\nRow3:0,8,3,8,3,8,0,...\n\nRow4:0,8,3,3,3,8,0,...\n\nRow5:0,8,8,8,8,0,...\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact positions. Let's think about the center cell (original row2, column2) which was 3. In the output, this becomes8. The cells around it (original 8s) become3. The new outer layer is8.\n\nSimilarly, the second structure in the test input is a 4x4 square of8s with a 2x2 of3s. The delta is3-8=-5. So the output layers would be8 (outer),3 (middle),8 (inner). \n\nThus, the transformed structure would have:\n\n- New outer layer of8.\n\n- Original 8s turned to3.\n\n- Original3s turned to8.\n\nSo the output would have a 6x6 structure.\n\nBut given the test input's size is 12x12, the output would be larger. \n\nPutting it all together, the test output should have both structures transformed according to the pattern, with each structure's layers alternated and expanded.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input grids are transformed into the output grids. \n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a central 3x3 square of 4s with a 6 in the middle. The output seems to expand that. The 4s form a diamond shape around the 6, and the 6s are now in a cross. Wait, in the output, the middle layer is 6s surrounded by 4s. So maybe it's like expanding each cell's value outwards, replacing adjacent zeros with the same number, but maybe there's a different rule when layers are added.\n\nExample 1's input has a 2 surrounding a 7. The output shows the 2s expanding outward, creating a larger border, and the 7s also expanded but with some 2s in between. The middle of the output has 7s in a cross shape, surrounded by 2s. Hmm, maybe each layer's value is being propagated outward, but the inner numbers take precedence over the outer ones. Like, the inner value (like 7) replaces the surrounding cells, but then the next layer (like 2) comes next.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 3s around 1s. The output has 3s expanding outward, and the 1s forming a cross inside, surrounded by 3s again. So perhaps the pattern is that each layer of the original shape is expanded by one cell in all directions, but the inner numbers are placed in a cross pattern. Or maybe it's creating a larger frame where each original number is surrounded by its own number, but in a specific way.\n\nLooking at the test input. There are two regions: one with 8s forming a 3x3 square (with a 3 in the center), and another 4x4 square of 8s with 3s in the center. The output should follow the same transformation as the examples. \n\nIn the examples, the output seems to create a frame around the original structure, expanding the numbers outward. For instance, in Example 0, the 4s expand outward by one layer, and the 6 in the middle becomes a cross. Wait, in the input of Example 0, the middle is 6. The output has the 6s in a cross (middle row and column) surrounded by 4s. So maybe the transformation is that each cell's value propagates to adjacent cells, but with some priority. Alternatively, it could be that the output is a \"thicker\" version of the input, where each block is expanded, and the inner parts are replaced with a cross of the next higher number, but that might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the layers. For example, the input in Example 0 is a 3x3 square of 4s with a 6 in the center. The output is a 5x5 square of 4s, with a cross of 6s. So maybe the pattern is that each cell in the input is expanded by one layer, and the original inner cells form a cross in the expanded layer. Wait, in the output of Example 0, the original 4s are now surrounding a cross of 6s, but the original 6 is now part of that cross. So perhaps the transformation involves taking each non-zero cell and creating a cross (up, down, left, right) of the same value around it, but only if those cells are zero. Or maybe it's a combination of expanding and creating a cross.\n\nAnother approach: Each non-zero cell in the input is the center of a cross in the output. So, for each cell with value V, in the output, the cell itself and the cells above, below, left, and right become V. But if there are overlapping crosses, perhaps the higher value takes precedence. However, in Example 1, the input has 7s in the middle. The output has a larger cross of 7s surrounded by 2s. Wait, maybe the rule is that the cells adjacent to a non-zero cell take on the value of that cell, but if multiple values are adjacent, the higher value takes precedence. But that might not fit all cases.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that the output is the input, but each original non-zero cell is surrounded by a layer of the same number, and the original inner cells form a cross. For instance, in Example 0, the 4s expand outward, creating a larger square, and the 6 in the center becomes a cross. So maybe the transformation is:\n\n- For each layer in the input (like the 4s and 6 in Example 0), create an expanded layer around it. The outermost layer's number becomes the next layer out, and the inner numbers form a cross.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by expanding each contiguous block of the same number by one layer in all directions. However, in Example 0, the original 4s are a 3x3 square. Expanding them by one layer would make a 5x5 square, but the output shows a 5x5 cross (the 4s in a diamond shape). So maybe it's not a simple expansion, but a cross-shaped expansion.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output seems to add layers around the original shapes. For example, in Example 0, the original 4s are in a 3x3 area. The output has them in a diamond shape that's larger, with 4s in a 5x5 diamond. The 6 in the center becomes a cross of 6s. Wait, but the original input's 6 is a single cell. The output's 6s are in a cross. So perhaps, each number in the input is turned into a cross of that number in the output, but also the surrounding numbers are expanded. But this might not explain the layers.\n\nLooking at the positions. For Example 0, the input's 4s are from rows 3-5 and columns 3-5 (0-indexed). The output's 4s in rows 2-6 and columns 2-6, but arranged in a diamond. The 6 in the input is at (4,4) (row 4, column 4). The output has 6s at (3,4), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4). So that's a cross shape. Then, the 4s surround that cross in a diamond pattern. So maybe the pattern is that each cell in the input with value V is replaced by a cross of V in the output, and the surrounding cells are filled with the next lower value (or the same as the original structure). But how does this apply to the examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of applying a cellular automaton-like rule where each non-zero cell spreads its value to its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right). But if multiple neighbors are present, the highest value takes precedence. Let's check Example 0. The input has a 6 at (4,4). Spreading to adjacent cells would make those 6s. But in the output, those adjacent cells are 4s. That doesn't fit. So perhaps the spreading is of the same value, but in the output, the original cells' values are replaced by a cross. \n\nAlternatively, the output is the input with each non-zero cell replaced by a cross of the same value, and then each original non-zero cell's neighboring cells (diagonals?) are filled with the same value. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nLet me look at Example 2. The input has 3s surrounding 1s. The output shows 3s expanded outward and 1s forming a cross. The original 1s in the input are in a 2x2 square. In the output, they form a cross (rows 3-6, columns 3-6). The 3s are in the outer layers, forming a diamond around the 1s. So perhaps the pattern is that each original non-zero cell's value is extended in a cross shape, and the surrounding cells are filled with the next higher (or lower) number. Wait, in Example 2, the 1s are inside the 3s. The output has the 1s in a cross, surrounded by 3s. So maybe the cross is formed by the inner numbers, and the outer numbers are expanded.\n\nAnother angle: The output seems to have each original shape expanded by one layer. For instance, in Example 0, the original 4s are a 3x3 square. The output's 4s form a diamond shape that's larger. The 6 in the center becomes a cross. Maybe the expansion is done by creating a diamond (Manhattan distance) around the original cells. For each cell in the input, in the output, all cells within Manhattan distance 1 are filled with the same value. Then, the original cells are replaced with a cross of the next higher value. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and applying a dilation operation with a cross-shaped kernel. Dilation in image processing expands regions by adding pixels to the boundaries. If the kernel is a cross (current cell plus up, down, left, right), then each non-zero cell in the input would create a cross in the output. However, if overlapping regions have different values, the highest value takes precedence. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0, the input's 4s form a 3x3 square. Applying a cross dilation would expand each 4 to a cross. The 6 in the center would also expand to a cross. So the output would have overlapping crosses. The highest value would be 6. But in the output of Example 0, the 6s are in a cross shape, surrounded by 4s. So perhaps the dilation is done first, then any overlapping cells take the maximum value. So for each cell in the output, if any of the input cells in its cross (original cell and up, down, left, right) are non-zero, the output cell takes the maximum value among those. Wait, let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the 6 is at (4,4). Dilation with a cross would make (3,4), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4) all 6. The surrounding 4s would have their crosses. The 4s around the 6 would expand into their adjacent cells, but those might be overwritten by the 6's cross. Wait, but in the output, the 4s form a diamond around the 6's cross. So maybe after dilation, there's another step where the layers are arranged.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that each cell in the output is the maximum value of the input cell and its four adjacent cells. Let's test for Example 0. Take cell (3,3) in the input, which is 4. The output cell (3,3) is 6. Wait, that can't be, because the input's (3,3) is 4, and adjacent cells are 4,4,4, and the cell below is 4. So the maximum would be 4. But the output cell (3,3) is 6. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: The output seems to create a border around each original structure. For example, in Example 0, the original 4s are in a 3x3 square. The output has a larger diamond of 4s, and a cross of 6 in the center. The number of layers increases. Maybe the transformation is adding a layer of the same number around each existing block and then creating a cross of the inner number. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is the input with each contiguous block of a certain number expanded by one cell in all directions, but the inner cells (original positions) are replaced with a cross of the next higher number. But in Example 0, the 6 is the inner cell. The cross is made of 6s, which is the same as the original. So that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each original cell with value V, in the output, the cell and its four neighbors are set to V. But if two cells overlap, the higher V takes precedence. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the 6 at (4,4) would set (4,4) and its neighbors to 6. The surrounding 4s would set their neighbors to 4. But the 6's cross would overwrite some of the 4s. Let's see the output. The 6's cross is indeed in the output, and around them are 4s. So that could be the case. For each cell in the input, set that cell and its four neighbors to the same value. If multiple cells affect the same output cell, take the maximum value.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis on Example 0. The input's 4s are around the 6. Each 4 cell would set itself and its four neighbors to 4. The 6 cell would set itself and its four neighbors to 6. So, overlapping areas would have 6 where the cross is. The 4s would create a larger area. Let's see the output of Example 0. The 6's cross is present, and the surrounding cells are 4s. Yes, this seems to fit. For example, cell (3,4) in the output is 6 because it's a neighbor of the original 6 at (4,4). The original 4 at (3,3) would set its neighbors, but the 6's neighbor (3,4) overrides to 6. Similarly, the original 4s around would set their neighbors to 4, except where the 6's cross is. \n\nIn Example 1, the input has 2s surrounding 7s. Applying the same rule: each 2 cell sets itself and four neighbors to 2. Each 7 cell sets itself and four neighbors to 7. The overlapping areas between 2 and 7 would have 7s. So the 7s would form a cross in their area, and the 2s around them. Looking at the output of Example 1, the 7s form a cross in the middle, surrounded by 2s. This seems to fit. \n\nSimilarly, Example 2 has 3s surrounding 1s. Each 3 cell sets itself and neighbors to 3. Each 1 cell sets itself and neighbors to 1. The overlapping areas would be 3 and 1. The maximum between them is 3, but wait, the output has 1s in a cross. Wait, this doesn't fit. In Example 2's output, the 1s are in a cross, which would mean that their own cross is applied, but the surrounding 3s' cross would overwrite the 1s. Unless the 1s are higher than 3s. But 1 is less than 3, so according to the maximum rule, the 3s would overwrite the 1s. But in Example 2's output, the 1s are present in a cross. So this contradicts the hypothesis. \n\nHmm. So maybe the rule is not taking the maximum value. Then what's different in Example 2? The input has 3s and 1s. The output has 1s forming a cross surrounded by 3s. If the 1s' cross is applied after the 3s, but the 1s are a higher priority? But 1 is lower than 3. \n\nAlternatively, the rule is that each cell in the output is the value of the closest non-zero cell in the input, with Manhattan distance. If two cells are equally close, the higher value is chosen. For example, the 6 in Example 0 is the center, so the cells adjacent to it (Manhattan distance 1) would take the 6's value, and cells further away take the 4s. But in Example 0's output, the 6s form a cross, which are exactly the cells at distance 1 from the center. Then, the next layer (distance 2) would be the 4s. That fits. So, the output cell's value is determined by the closest non-zero input cell. If two cells are equally close, take the higher value. \n\nTesting this on Example 0: The center cell (4,4) is 6. Cells at Manhattan distance 1 from it (up, down, left, right) would take 6. Cells at distance 2 (the original 4s) would take 4. So the output would have a cross of 6s surrounded by 4s, which matches the output. \n\nFor Example 1: The input has 7s in the middle (cells (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5)). Each of these would have Manhattan distance 0. The adjacent cells (distance 1) would be 7s. The 2s surrounding them would be at a distance 1 from the 2 cells, but for cells equidistant between 7 and 2, since 7 is higher, they take 7. Wait, but in Example 1's output, the 7s form a cross, and the 2s are further out. Let me see. The input's 7s are in a 2x2 block. The cells adjacent to them would be at distance 1 from the 7s. If a cell is adjacent to both a 7 and a 2, it's distance 1 from both. So the higher value (7) is chosen. But in the output of Example 1, the 7s form a larger cross, which would require that cells at distance 1 from the original 7s are 7s, and cells at distance 2 from 7s would be 2s. But the original 2s are at distance 2 from the center. So this might fit. For example, the output's middle rows have 7s in a cross, which are distance 1 from the original 7s, and the 2s are further out. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1's input, the 7s are in a 2x2 square. The cells adjacent to them (distance 1) would form a cross around each 7. But since the original 7s are in a block, their combined adjacent cells form a larger cross. For example, the original 7 at (4,4) has adjacent cells (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5). Similarly for the other 7s. The overlapping of these adjacent cells would form a cross that's bigger. Then, the 2s are further away. \n\nThis seems to fit. So the rule is: each cell in the output is the value of the closest non-zero input cell (by Manhattan distance). If multiple cells are at the same distance, the highest value is taken. \n\nLet's check Example 2. The input has 1s in a 2x2 block surrounded by 3s. The closest non-zero cells to the output's 1 cross would be the original 1s. The cells adjacent to the 1s would have distance 1, so they take 1. But the original 3s are further away. Wait, but in the output of Example 2, the 1s form a cross, surrounded by 3s. For example, the output cell (3,3) is 1. Let's calculate the Manhattan distance from the original 1s. The original 1s are at (4,3), (4,4), (5,3), (5,4). The cell (3,3) is distance 1 from (4,3), which is a 3 in the input? Wait no, the input's cell (4,3) is part of the 3s. Wait, no. Wait, in the input of Example 2, the 3s are in a ring around the 1s. The 1s are at positions (4,3), (4,4), (5,3), (5,4). So the cell (3,3) in the output is distance 1 from (4,3) (original 3 cell). But the original 3s are at (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), etc. Wait, the input's 3s are in rows 3-6, columns 2-5. So cell (3,3) in the input is a 3. So according to the rule, the closest non-zero cell to (3,3) in the output is the original input cell (3,3) which is 3. But in the output, (3,3) is 1. So this contradicts the hypothesis. \n\nHmm. That's a problem. Maybe the rule isn't based on Manhattan distance. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking the original shape and expanding each cell into a cross, then filling in the gaps with the surrounding numbers. For example, each original cell's value is spread to form a cross in the output. If there's overlap, the highest value is retained. \n\nIn Example 0, the 4s in the input form a 3x3 square. Each 4 is replaced by a cross of 4s. The 6 is replaced by a cross of 6s. Overlapping areas where crosses meet would have the higher value. So the 6's cross would override the 4s' crosses where they overlap. This would result in a larger area of 4s except where the 6's cross is. \n\nIn Example 0's output, the 4s form a diamond around the 6 cross. That could happen if the 4s' crosses combine to form a diamond, and the 6's cross is in the center. \n\nFor Example 2, the input's 3s are spread into crosses, and the 1s' crosses would be overridden by the 3s if they are higher. But the output has 1s in a cross. Wait, but 1 is lower than 3. So this doesn't fit. Unless the 1s' crosses are applied after the 3s, but that would require a different priority. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look for another approach. Maybe the output is a \"zoom\" or scaling up of the input, where each cell becomes a 2x2 block, but with some pattern. For example, in Example 0, the input is 10x10, output is also 10x10, so scaling is not the case. \n\nAnother idea: The output is the input with each cell's value copied to its four neighbors, and the original cell. Then, if multiple values are written to the same cell, the maximum is taken. \n\nLet's test this for Example 0. Original 6 at (4,4) would set itself and four neighbors to 6. Original 4s around would set their cells and neighbors to 4. The overlapping cells (the cross of 6) would have 6, which is higher than 4. The rest of the 4s would form a diamond shape. This matches the output. \n\nFor Example 1, the 7s in the middle would set their cross to 7, overriding the 2s' crosses. The 2s around would set their crosses, but where they overlap with 7s, 7 remains. This fits the output. \n\nFor Example 2, the 1s are surrounded by 3s. The 1s' crosses would set 1s in their cross, but the 3s' crosses are higher (3), so the 1s would be overwritten. But in the output, the 1s are present. This contradicts the hypothesis. \n\nAh, but in Example 2, the input has the 1s in the center surrounded by 3s. When the 3s' crosses are applied, they would overwrite the 1s' crosses. But in the output, the 1s are in a cross. So this suggests that the 1s' crosses are being applied after the 3s, but that's not possible unless the priority is reversed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the highest value is not taken, but the first applied. Or perhaps the expansion is done in a certain order. For example, expanding from the highest values first. \n\nIn Example 2, the 3s are higher than 1s. So when expanding the 3s, their crosses would overwrite any existing cells. Then expanding the 1s, their crosses would only affect cells not already set by the 3s. But in the output, the 1s are surrounded by 3s. The original 1s are in a 2x2 block. Expanding them would create a cross, but since the 3s have already been expanded, the 1s' crosses would only affect the cells not already set by 3s. However, the cells around the 1s are already set to 3 by the 3s' expansion. So the 1s' crosses wouldn't show up. But in the output, they do. So this hypothesis is invalid. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's think differently. Looking at the output of Example 2, the 1s form a cross that's surrounded by 3s. The original 1s are in a 2x2 block. Their crosses would create a cross shape. For example, each 1 in the input (like (4,3)) would create a cross at (4,3) and adjacent cells. But the 3s around would have their own crosses. However, in the output, the 1s' cross is surrounded by 3s, implying that the 3s' expansion must have happened after the 1s. But since 3 is higher than 1, their crosses would overwrite the 1s. So this doesn't make sense. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the output is the result of two steps. First, expand each non-zero cell to a cross. Second, fill the areas between these crosses with the same number as their original surrounding. For example, creating a border around each original shape. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a convolution with a kernel that detects edges and expands them. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, looking at the test input. The test input has two regions. The first is a 3x3 square of 8s with a 3 in the center. The second is a 4x4 square of 8s with 3s in the center. \n\nApplying the pattern from the training examples, the output should expand each of these regions. The 8s should form a larger border, and the 3s in the center should form a cross. So for the first region (upper left), the input is:\n\nRow 1: 8,8,8\n\nRow 2:8,3,8\n\nRow 3:8,8,8\n\nSo the output should expand this. The 8s would form a diamond around the 3's cross. Similarly, the lower right region has 8s in a 4x4 square with 3s in the center. The output would expand those 8s into a larger shape and the 3s into a cross. \n\nIf the pattern is that each non-zero cell in the input is replaced by a cross of the same value, and overlapping areas take the higher value, then the test input's output would have:\n\nFor the upper left region: the 3 in the center would form a cross of 3s. The surrounding 8s would form crosses, but since 8 is higher than 3, the 8s' crosses would overwrite the 3's cross except in the original 3's position. Wait, no. The 3's cross would be (assuming each cell's cross is added), but the 8s around it would also add their crosses. Since 8 is higher, their crosses would take precedence. \n\nBut according to the training examples, when there's a higher number surrounding a lower one, like Example 0's 6 (higher than 4), the cross of 6 is in the center. Similarly, in Example 1's 7 (higher than 2), the cross of 7 is in the center. So perhaps when a higher number is surrounded by lower numbers, the higher's cross overrides the lower's cross in the overlapping areas. \n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nFor the upper left region: the 3 is surrounded by 8s. The 8s are higher, so their crosses would overwrite the 3's cross. Wait, but in the input, the 3 is in the center of 8s. So when expanding, each 8's cross would spread 8s, and the 3's cross would spread 3s. But since 8 is higher, the 3's cross would be overwritten by the 8s' crosses. But in the training examples, the inner higher numbers' crosses are present. \n\nWait, in Example 0, the 6 is higher than the 4s. The 6's cross is in the output, surrounded by 4s. So the 6's cross overwrites the 4s' crosses. So higher values take precedence. \n\nSo for the upper left test input region: the 3 is surrounded by 8s. So when expanding, the 8s' crosses would overwrite the 3's cross. But the 3 is in the center. The original 3's cross would include itself and the four adjacent 8s. But the 8s' crosses would spread into those cells. So the 3's cross would only exist where there's no higher value. \n\nWait, in the test input's upper left region, the 3 is at position (2,2) (assuming rows start at 0). The surrounding 8s are at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). When expanding, each 8 cell would create a cross. The 3's cross would be (2,2), (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3). But these cells are already part of the 8s' crosses. Since 8 is higher than 3, those cells would be 8s. Only the original 3's cell (2,2) might remain 3 if the rule allows. But according to the examples, when a higher value's cross overlaps, it takes precedence. \n\nBut in Example 0, the 6's cross is in the center. The original 6's cell is (4,4). When expanded, its cross includes (3,4), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4). The surrounding 4s' crosses would spread into those cells, but since 6 is higher, they become 6. So the 6's cross overwrites the 4s' crosses. \n\nSimilarly, for the test input's upper left region: the 3's cross would be overwritten by the 8s' crosses. So the only cell remaining 3 would be the original cell (2,2), but according to the rule, when expanding, the 8s' crosses would set (2,2) to 8. Because the 8 cells adjacent to (2,2) would spread their crosses into (2,2). For example, the 8 at (1,2) would set (0,2), (1,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,2) to 8. Similarly, the 8 at (2,1) would set (2,0), (2,1), (1,1), (3,1), (2,2) to 8. So the 3's original cell (2,2) would be overwritten by 8. But in the training examples, the higher value's cross is preserved. \n\nThis contradicts the training examples. So my earlier hypothesis must be wrong. \n\nLet me think again. Perhaps the pattern is that the output is created by expanding each non-zero cell into a plus sign (cross), and then the entire structure is surrounded by the next layer of the same number. For example, in Example 0, the 4s are expanded into a cross, then surrounded by another layer of 4s. But the center cross is 6. \n\nAlternatively, the output is a kind of outline around the original non-zero cells. For instance, the output for Example 0 shows the 4s forming a diamond outline around the 6's cross. The 6's cross is the original 6 plus its adjacent cells. So perhaps the pattern is: for each non-zero cell, create a cross. Then, for each cross, create a diamond outline around it using the same number. \n\nAlternatively, the output is the input's cells and their adjacent cells (including diagonals) filled with the same number, forming a diamond shape. But this doesn't fit Example 0's output. \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by applying two iterations of expansion. The first iteration expands each cell to its adjacent cells, and the second iteration expands again. But the examples show a single layer of expansion. \n\nAnother observation: In each example, the output's non-zero regions are one layer larger than the input's. For Example 0, the input's 4s are 3x3. The output's 4s are 5x5. The 6's cross is in the center. So perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero cell's value is expanded outward in all directions by one cell, creating a larger shape. The original inner cells are replaced by a cross of the next higher number. Wait, in Example 0, the original 4s expand outward, making a larger diamond, and the center 6 is replaced by a cross. But how is the next higher number determined? It's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, the output is the result of applying a kernel that turns each cell into a 3x3 cross, then merging those crosses. But again, not sure. \n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let me try to summarize the patterns I see:\n\nIn each example, the output has expanded the original shapes. The original numbers are present in a larger area, and the inner numbers form a cross. The outer numbers seem to be expanded by one layer. For example, in Example 0:\n\nInput:\nRow 3: 4,4,4\nRow 4:4,6,4\nRow 5:4,4,4\n\nOutput:\nRow 2:4,4,4\nRow 3:4,6,6,6,4\nRow 4:4,6,4,6,4\nRow 5:4,6,6,6,4\nRow 6:4,4,4\n\nThe 4s are expanded outward, and the 6 forms a cross. \n\nSimilarly, Example 1's output expands the 2s and 7s. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is:\n\nFor each non-zero cell in the input, create a cross (current cell and up, down, left, right) in the output. Then, surrounding each original block, add a layer of the same number as the original block. \n\nAlternatively, the output is created by expanding each contiguous block of the same number by adding a layer around it, and the inner part of the block is replaced by a cross of the next higher number. But how is the next higher number determined?\n\nAlternatively, for each cell in the input, if it's part of a border (edge of a block), it remains the same; if it's an internal cell, it's replaced by a cross of the same value. But this doesn't explain the examples. \n\nAnother idea: The output is the input with each non-zero cell replaced by a cross of the same value, and then any zeros adjacent to non-zero cells are filled with the same number as the nearest non-zero cell. This might create the expanded layers. But again, not sure. \n\nPerhaps looking at the test input and trying to apply the pattern:\n\nTest input has two regions. The upper-left region is a 3x3 square of 8s with a 3 in the center. The output should expand the 8s into a larger shape, and the 3 in the center should form a cross. But since 8 is higher than 3, the 3's cross would be overwritten by the 8s. However, in the training examples, the higher number's cross is preserved. So maybe the 3's cross would be present only in the original 3's position and its adjacent cells, but the surrounding 8s would form a larger border. \n\nAlternatively, for the upper-left region of the test input:\n\nOriginal 8s form a ring around the 3. The output would expand the 8s outward, creating a larger ring. The 3 in the center would form a cross. So the output would have a cross of 3s in the center of the upper-left region, surrounded by 8s. \n\nFor the lower-right region, the input has a 4x4 square of 8s with a 2x2 block of 3s in the center. The output would expand the 8s outward, and the 3s would form a cross. So the output for this region would have a cross of 3s surrounded by 8s. \n\nPutting this together, the test output would have two regions: one in the upper-left with a cross of 3s surrounded by 8s, and another in the lower-right with a cross of 3s surrounded by 8s. \n\nLooking at the training examples' outputs, the cross of the inner number is surrounded by the outer number. So the upper-left region in the test input's output would look like:\n\nRows 1-3: 8s forming a larger square, with a cross of 3s in the center. \n\nSimilarly, the lower-right region would have a cross of 3s surrounded by 8s. \n\nNow, let's try to construct the output for the test input.\n\nThe test input is a 12x12 grid. The upper-left region is at rows 1-3 (0-based), columns 1-3. The lower-right region is at rows 6-9, columns 6-9.\n\nFor the upper-left region:\n\nOriginal 3 is at (2,2). The output would have a cross of 3s at (2,2) and its adjacent cells. But the surrounding 8s would expand outward. So the output for this region would have 8s expanded by one layer, and the 3's cross. \n\nSimilarly, the lower-right region's 3s are in a 2x2 block. Their crosses would form a larger cross, surrounded by 8s. \n\nSo the output should have:\n\nFor the upper-left region:\n\n- The original 3's cross: cells (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2) become 3.\n\n- The 8s expand outward, so the surrounding cells become 8s, forming a diamond around the 3's cross.\n\nFor the lower-right region:\n\nThe 3s in a 2x2 block (rows 7-8, columns 7-8) would each form a cross. The combined crosses would form a larger cross of 3s. The surrounding 8s expand outward.\n\nBut in the test input's lower-right region, the 8s are in rows 6-9, columns 6-9. The 3s are in rows 7-8, columns 7-8. So expanding the 3s would create a cross in that area. \n\nApplying the pattern from the training examples, the output for the test input would have:\n\nUpper-left region:\n\nRows 0-4:\n\nRow 0: 0s except columns 0-4 might have some 8s.\n\nRow 1: 8s expanded, with a cross of 3s in the middle.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to construct the output step by step. \n\nFor the upper-left region in the test input:\n\nInput cells:\n\nRow 1: [0, 8,8,8, ...]\n\nRow 2: [0, 8,3,8, ...]\n\nRow 3: [0, 8,8,8, ...]\n\nExpanding each 8 and 3 into a cross. For each cell:\n\n- 8 at (1,1): cross is (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1) set to 8.\n\n- 8 at (1,2): cross is (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,2) set to 8.\n\n- 3 at (2,2): cross is (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2) set to 3.\n\n- 8 at (1,3): cross is (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3) set to 8.\n\nSimilarly for other 8s. \n\nSo overlapping areas:\n\nFor cell (1,2), which is 8 in the input. Its cross would set (0,2) to 8, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) to 8, and (2,2) to 8. But the 3's cross at (2,2) would set (2,2) to 3. Since 3 is lower than 8, if higher value takes precedence, then (2,2) remains 8. But in the training examples, the higher value's cross overwrites lower. For example, in Example 0, the 6's cross overwrites the 4s' crosses. So in the test input, the 3's cross would have lower priority than the 8s' crosses. Hence, the 3's cross cells would be overwritten by 8s. So the only 3 left would be the original cell (2,2) if the 8's crosses don't reach it. \n\nBut in the test input's original cell (2,2), the 3 is there. When expanding, the 8s' crosses would cover (2,2). For example, the 8 at (1,2) sets (2,2) to 8. The 8 at (2,1) sets (2,2) to 8. Similarly for other 8s. So the 3's cross would be overwritten by 8s. Hence, in the output, there would be no 3s in the upper-left region, which contradicts the training examples. \n\nThis suggests that my previous understanding is incorrect. Maybe the rule is that the innermost number's cross takes precedence, even if lower. But that doesn't fit the training examples. \n\nI'm stuck. Let me look at the test input again and try to apply what I think is the pattern from the examples.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 6 is surrounded by 4s. The output has a cross of 6s surrounded by 4s. So the higher number's cross is preserved. \n\nIn the test input's upper-left region, the 3 is surrounded by 8s. Since 8 is higher, their crosses would overwrite the 3's cross. So the output would have no 3s, but this doesn't match the examples' pattern. \n\nBut maybe the pattern is that the innermost number's cross is preserved regardless of value. So even if lower, the innermost cross is present. \n\nIn Example 0, the 6 is the innermost, so its cross is preserved. In the test input's upper-left region, the 3 is the innermost, so its cross would be preserved, even though 8 is higher. But this would contradict the priority based on value. \n\nAlternatively, the cross's priority is based on the order of processing: inner cells are processed first, then outer cells. So the 3's cross is applied first, then the 8s' crosses overwrite where they can. But this would leave some 3s in the output. \n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the assumption that each non-zero cell's cross is created, and higher values overwrite lower ones in overlapping areas. \n\nFor the test input's upper-left region, the 3's cross would be overwritten by the 8s' crosses. Hence, no 3s in the output. But the training examples show that inner higher values' crosses are present. So perhaps the test input's upper-left region's output is a diamond of 8s with no 3s. But that doesn't match the examples. \n\nAlternatively, the 3's cross is present, and the 8s form a diamond around it. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to construct the test output based on the examples' pattern. \n\nFor the upper-left region:\n\nThe input has a 3x3 square of 8s with a 3 in the center. The output should expand the 8s into a larger diamond and the 3 into a cross. So the output would have:\n\nRows 0-4, columns 0-4:\n\nRow 0: 0s except maybe some 8s.\n\nRow 1: 8s in a cross, expanding from the original 8s.\n\nRow 2: 8s with a 3 cross in the center.\n\nRow 3: similar to row 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll attempt to write the output based on expanding each cell's cross with higher values overriding.",
