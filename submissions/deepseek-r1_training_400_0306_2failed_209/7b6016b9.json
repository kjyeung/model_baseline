        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have these input and output examples where each input is a grid of numbers, and the output is another grid. My job is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input to the output and then apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at the training examples:\n\nIn Example 0, the input has a lot of 0s and 8s. The output replaces most 0s with 3s, but there are some 2s as well. Let's look closer. The 8s in the input are retained in the output. The 0s around the 8s are turned into 3s, but in some areas, like rows 5-7 and 9-11, there are 2s. It looks like 2s are introduced in positions adjacent to the 8s but within certain boundaries. Maybe there's a distance-based replacement here. Like, cells adjacent to the 8s are 2, and others are 3? Or perhaps it's based on some structural pattern.\n\nExample 1 uses 0s and 1s. The output replaces 0s with 3s, but near the 1s, some 0s are replaced with 2s. For instance, in rows 4-7, the cells around the 1s are 2s. The 1s themselves stay as 1. Similarly, in Example 2, with 4s, the 0s around the 4s become 2s, and others become 3s.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: the special number (like 8, 1, 4 in the examples) remains the same. The 0s that are adjacent (maybe in a cross or a certain direction) to these special numbers are replaced with 2, and all other 0s become 3. But how exactly?\n\nLooking at the first example's input row 5:\n\nOriginal input row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\nOutput row: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3]\n\nSo around the 8s, the adjacent cells (left and right) become 2. Wait, but in this row, the 8 is at position 6. The output has 2s at positions 7,8,9 (right side of the 8). But then another 8 at position 10. So between 8s, maybe the 0s are turned into 2s only if they are between two 8s? Or maybe the 2s are in the cells that are in the same row as the 8 but separated by certain steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in cells that are part of a \"corridor\" leading to the special number. Or perhaps it's a matter of regions. For example, regions enclosed by the special number (like 8) are filled with 2s, while the rest of the 0s are 3s.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 0s that are in the same row or column as the special number and are between two instances of the special number are replaced with 2s. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's row 5, the 8s are at positions 6 and 10. The cells between them (positions 7,8,9) are 0s in the input and 2s in the output. Similarly, in the row below, same pattern. So perhaps the 0s that are between two 8s in the same row (or column) get replaced by 2. But how does this work vertically?\n\nAlternatively, maybe any 0 that is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to the special number becomes 2, but in the examples, sometimes there are 2s in rows that are not adjacent. Hmm, that might not fit.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has a row with 1s in a horizontal line (third row). Then in rows below, the 0s adjacent to the 1s (in the same column?) become 2. For example, in the fourth row, the 1 is at position 4. The output row is [3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,1,3,...]. So the 0s next to 1 in the same row become 2. So maybe any 0 that is in the same row or column as the special number and is between two special numbers, or adjacent to a special number in that row/column, becomes 2. And all other 0s become 3.\n\nBut let's think of another angle. The examples have the output replacing all 0s with 3, except for certain 0s that are in \"paths\" connected to the special numbers, which become 2. For example, in the first example, the 8s form a kind of structure, and the 0s that are in corridors between 8s are 2s. Maybe the 2s are the cells that are on the same row or column as a special number, and are between two special numbers, or adjacent to a special number in a certain direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is such that all 0s are replaced by 3, except for those that are in the same row or column as a special number (8,1,4) and are contiguous with the special number, but not directly adjacent. Wait, that might not fit.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input row 4:\n\nInput row: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,...]\n\nOutput row: [3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,1,3,...]\n\nSo the 0s that are in between the 1s in the same row are replaced with 2. So between the 1 at position 4 and the 1 at position 10, the 0s in between are 2. Similarly between 10 and 16 (positions 10 to 16?), but in the output, those are also 2s. So it's like, in each row, the 0s that are between two 1s (or adjacent to a 1?) become 2, and others become 3. Similarly, in Example 2, the 4s in the row, the 0s between them become 2.\n\nSo the pattern could be: For each row, replace 0s with 2 if they are between two instances of the special number (8,1,4, etc.) in that row. All other 0s become 3. But how about columns? Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, looking at column positions. Let's take the first column. The input has 0s except for a few rows. The output has 3s. But in some rows, there are 8s. But how about vertical runs. For example, in the input, maybe vertical sequences are also considered. But the examples don't show 2s in vertical runs. So perhaps the transformation is row-based only.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are the 0s that are in between two special numbers in the same row. So if a row has a special number, then any 0s that are between two of the same special number in that row become 2. All other 0s become 3.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nTake Example 0's input row 5:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3]\n\nSo between the 8s at positions 6 and 10 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), the 0s become 2. Similarly, between 10 and 16, but the output for those positions is 3. Wait, in this row, the 8s are at positions 6, 10, 16, 20 (assuming 0-based index). The output shows 2s between 6 and 10 (positions 7-9), then 3s from 11-15, then 8 at 16, then 3s. So why are those 3s? Because between 10 and 16, there are no 8s? Wait, position 16 is another 8. So the 0s between 10 and 16 should be 2s if between two 8s. But in the input, positions 10 and 16 are 8s, and the 0s in between (positions 11-15) are 0. The output has them as 3. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nHmm, maybe the direction matters. Like, the 0s are only converted to 2 if they are between two consecutive 8s in the same row, with no other 8s in between. Or maybe it's the first pair. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that 0s that are between two 8s (or the special number) in the same row and are directly adjacent. Wait, but in the first example's row 5, the 8s are separated by 0s. For instance, between 8 at position 6 and 8 at position 10, the 0s in between are converted to 2. Then after 10, there's a 0, which is part of the next segment between 10 and 16. But in that segment, the output is 3. So maybe only the first segment between two 8s in the row? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in regions that are \"inside\" a structure made by the special numbers. For example, if a row has a run of 8s with some 0s in between, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe the 2s are in cells that are adjacent to 8s in a certain way. But in the first example's row 5, the 8 at position 6 is followed by three 0s (positions 7-9) which are turned into 2s, and then another 8 at position 10. So maybe the 0s between two 8s in the same row become 2s, but only if they are consecutive? Like, between two 8s in the same row, all the 0s between them become 2s. But in that case, between 8 at position 10 and 8 at position 16 in row 5, there are 0s. But in the output, those are 3s. So that hypothesis is invalid.\n\nWait, looking at the input row 5 again, after position 10 (8), there's 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8 (position 16). So positions 11-15 are 0s. The output for those is 3. So why are those 0s not converted to 2?\n\nHmm. Maybe the 2s are only in cells that are between two 8s (or the special number) in the same row and the same column? Or perhaps the 2s are in cells that are adjacent to the special number, but in certain directions. For example, in the first example, the 2s are to the right of an 8, but not to the left. Let's check.\n\nIn the first example's row 5, the 8 is at position 6. The 2s are at 7,8,9. Then another 8 at 10. The 2s are between 6 and 10. Then after 10, there's 0s which are 3. So maybe the 0s between two 8s in the same row are turned into 2s. But in this case, positions 6 and 10 are 8s, so the 0s between them (7-9) are 2s. Then between 10 and 16, there are 0s but those are 3s. But there's an 8 at 16. So why isn't the 10 to 16 considered a segment? Because there's no other 8 in between?\n\nWait, in row 5 of Example 0's input, the 8s are at 6, 10, 16, 20. Let's list the positions:\n\nPositions (assuming 0-based):\n\nRow 5: 0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0.\n\nSo between 6 and 10 (indices 6 and 10), the 0s are at 7,8,9. These become 2s.\n\nBetween 10 and 16 (indices 10 and 16), there are 0s at 11-15. But the output has 3s here. So why?\n\nAh, maybe because the 8s are separated by other 8s. Wait, perhaps the 2s are between two consecutive 8s in the same row. So between 6 and 10, there's a stretch of 0s between two 8s. Then after 10, the next 8 is at 16. So the 0s between 10 and 16 would also be converted to 2. But in the output, they are 3s. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are only between the first pair of 8s in the row. But that doesn't explain other rows.\n\nLet me check another example. Take Example 2's input row 8:\n\nInput row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput row: [3,3,3,3,4,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3]\n\nSo here, the 4 is at position 4. Then 0s until position 9 where there's a 4. Between them, the 0s (positions 5-8) are turned into 2s. Then after position 9, there are 4s. So the 0s between the 4 at position 4 and the next 4 at position 9 become 2s. So again, between two 4s, the 0s become 2s.\n\nBut in the row after that (row 9), the input is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput row:\n\n[3,3,3,3,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nSo between the 4 at position 4 and 13, the 0s between them (positions 5-12) become 2s. So this supports the idea that between two instances of the special number in the same row, the 0s are replaced by 2.\n\nBut why in the first example's row 5, between 10 and 16 (positions 10 and 16 are 8s), the 0s are 3s. Wait, perhaps in that case, there's an 8 at position 16, but between 10 and 16, there are other 8s? Let me check the input row again. Oh, no, in row 5, the input has 8s at positions 6, 10, 16, 20. Between 10 and 16, there are no other 8s, just 0s. But in the output, those 0s are 3s. So that contradicts the pattern.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the 2s are only between the first two 8s in a row. But that doesn't hold. Let's think of other possibilities.\n\nMaybe the direction matters. For example, the 2s are in the horizontal segments between two 8s, but not vertical. But in Example 2, there are vertical runs. Let's check Example 2's row 5:\n\nInput row: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput row: [3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3]\n\nHere, it's all 4s and 0s, but the output has 3s around. So no 2s here. But this row is a solid block of 4s except for the edges. So maybe the 2s are only when there are 0s between 4s. Wait, but this row has all 4s except the first and last positions. So no 0s between 4s, hence no 2s.\n\nAnother example: in Example 2's row 13:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [3,3,3,3,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,3]\n\nSo between 4s at positions 4 and 7 (indices 4 and 7), there are 0s at 5 and 6. In output, these are 2s. Then between 7 and 13 (4s), the 0s at 8-12 are 2s. Then between 13 and 18 (4s), but the input has 0s at 14-17, which are converted to 3. Wait, but between 13 (4) and 18 (4?), the output shows 3s. Hmm, maybe in this case, the 4 at 13 is followed by 0s until 18, but the output for 14-17 is 3. So why?\n\nWait, in the input row 13:\n\nIndices 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:4,5:0,6:0,7:4,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:4,14:0,15:0,16:0,17:0,18:4,19:0,20:0.\n\nThe output is:\n\n3,3,3,3,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,3.\n\nSo between 4 at index 4 and 7: 0s at 5-6 \u2192 2s. Between 7 and 13 (4 at 13): 0s at 8-12 \u2192 2s. Between 13 and 18 (4 at 18): 0s at 14-17 \u2192 3s. So why are those 3s? Because between 13 and 18, there's a 4 at 13 and 18. The 0s in between are 14-17. But in the output, those are 3s. That contradicts the previous pattern.\n\nSo this suggests that the pattern isn't just about being between two special numbers in the same row. There must be another factor.\n\nLooking at the example again, in row 13 of Example 2's input, after the 4 at index 13, the next 4 is at index 18. But the 0s between them (14-17) are converted to 3. So why the difference?\n\nWait, perhaps the direction of the \"between\" matters. Maybe the 2s are only in the cells that are between two special numbers in the same row and are part of a contiguous block of 0s that are between two special numbers, but in the case of row 13, perhaps the 4 at 7 and 13, then the 0s between them are turned into 2, but the 4 at 13 and 18 are not part of the same row in a way that would make the 0s between them 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are only in cells that are between two special numbers and are in the same horizontal or vertical corridor. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are adjacent (left or right) to a special number are turned into 2s. But looking at Example 0's row 5: the 8 at position 6 has 0s to the right (7,8,9) which become 2s. The 8 at 10 has 0s to the left (7-9, but those are already handled). To the right of 10 is 11, which is 0 in input and 3 in output. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s that are adjacent to a special number in any direction (up, down, left, right) become 2s. Let's check Example 0's row 5. The 8s are in positions 6,10,16,20. The 0s adjacent to these 8s would be positions 5,7,9,11,15,17,19,21. But in the output, the 0s at 7-9 are 2s. The others (like 5,11, etc.) are 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: look for the transformation rules based on the examples.\n\nThe key observations:\n\n- The special numbers (8,1,4,7 in the test) remain the same.\n\n- The 0s are replaced by 3s, except for certain cases where they become 2s.\n\nLooking at the cases where 0s become 2s:\n\nIn Example 0, the 2s are in the same row between 8s and in some vertical paths. Like in row 5, between 8s. In row 9, there's a 8, then 0s, then another 8. The 0s between become 2. But in other rows, like row 15, which is all 8s, no 2s.\n\nIn Example 1, the 2s are in rows where there are 1s, and the 0s between them are turned into 2s. Like row 4 has 1 at position 4 and 10, so the 0s between are 2. Similarly, row 7 has a horizontal line of 1s.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2s are between 4s in the same row.\n\nSo the common pattern is that in each row, the 0s that are between two instances of the special number (the non-zero number in the input) are replaced by 2s, and all other 0s become 3s. So for each row, scan from left to right. When you find a special number (e.g., 8), then any 0s after it until the next special number in that row are replaced by 2. But wait, in Example 0's row 5, between 8 at 6 and 10, the 0s are 2. But between 10 and 16, the 0s are 3. That doesn't fit. Unless there's a different rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that between two consecutive special numbers in the same row, the 0s are replaced by 2. But if there's another special number in between, then it's a new segment. So in Example 0's row 5, after 8 at 10, the next 8 is at 16. So the 0s between 10 and 16 are replaced by 2? But in the output, they are 3. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are only in the first such segment. No, that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are in all segments between consecutive pairs of the special number. But why in row 5 of Example 0, there's only one segment converted to 2. Maybe the input has multiple segments but the output only converts some. So this approach is not working.\n\nAnother angle: look for the position of 2s in the outputs.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2s are in certain rows and columns. Let's see row 5, columns 7-9 (2s). The input row has 8s at columns 6 and 10, so between them. Similarly, in row 9, there are 8s at columns 6 and 10 again, and the 0s between are 2s. But in row 15, all are 8s, so no 2s. So the pattern seems to be that between two 8s in the same row, the 0s are 2s.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 5, after the 8 at column 10, the next 8 is at column 16. So the 0s between 10 and 16 should be 2s. But in the output, they are 3. That's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe there's a vertical component. Like, the 0s are replaced to 2 if they are between two 8s in the same row OR column. Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's row 5, column 11. The input is 0. Output is 3. What's the column 11 look like? Let's see:\n\nLooking at column 11 in Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: 0\n\nRow 1: 0\n\nRow 2: 0\n\nRow 3: 0\n\nRow 4: 8 (since row 4 is [3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, ...], but original input's row 4 was [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,8,0,...] so column 11 (assuming 0-based) would be 8. So in column 11, there's an 8 in row 4. But the 0 in row 5, column 11 is part of the 0s between 10 and 16. But in the output, it's 3. So vertical adjacency might not play a role.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are only in the cells that are part of a \"room\" or enclosed area. For example, if a 0 is surrounded by special numbers on all four sides, but that's probably not the case here.\n\nAnother possibility: the 2s are in regions that are connected to the special numbers but not part of the main structure. Maybe the 2s are paths leading to dead ends. For example, in Example 0, there are horizontal paths of 8s, and the 2s are the branches off those paths. But without the visual structure, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are the 0s that are in the same row or column as a special number and are directly adjacent to the special number. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's row 5, the 8s are at columns 6, 10, 16, 20. The 0s adjacent to them (columns 5,7,9,11,15,17,19,21) would be candidates. But the output has 2s in columns 7-9, which are adjacent to 6 and 10. So maybe the 0s between two 8s in the same row are 2s if they are between them and adjacent. Wait, but columns 7-9 are between 6 and 10. So perhaps any 0 that is between two 8s in the same row and within a certain distance. Or perhaps the entire stretch between two 8s in the same row becomes 2s.\n\nBut again, this doesn't explain why between 10 and 16 the 0s are 3s.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are the 0s that are adjacent to a special number in the same row. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's row 5, 8 at 6. The adjacent 0s are 5 and 7. But in the output, 7 is 2, 5 is 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s to the right of each special number in the row are replaced with 2s until the next special number. For example, for each special number in a row, all 0s to the right until the next special number are replaced with 2s.\n\nIn Example 0's row 5:\n\n8 at 6: the 0s to the right are 7,8,9 until the next 8 at 10. So those become 2s.\n\nThen 8 at 10: the 0s to the right are 11,12,13,14,15 until the next 8 at 16. So these would be 2s. But in the output, they are 3s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the 2s are only between the first two 8s in a row. But that's not the case in other examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are between two 8s when the next 8 is in the same row and there's at least one 0 between them. For example, in row 5 of Example 0, between 6 and 10 there are 0s, so they become 2. Between 10 and 16, there are 0s but in the output, they are 3. So why?\n\nWait, perhaps the direction matters. Maybe the 2s are to the right of the first 8 in a pair. But that's unclear.\n\nLet me think of the test input. The test input has a special number 7. Let's see:\n\nTest input row 1:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput for this row should replace the 0s between the two 7s with 2s. So between columns 5 and 16 (assuming 0-based), the 0s are between 7s. So in the output, those 0s (columns 6-15) would become 2s.\n\nAnother test row: row 2:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0]\n\nIn this row, 7s are at columns 5, 11, 16, 22. So between 5 and 11, 0s become 2s. Between 11 and 16, 0s become 2s. Between 16 and 22, 0s become 2s. And the rest are 3s.\n\nSo the output for this row would have 2s between each pair of 7s.\n\nThus, the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- Replace all occurrences of the special number (like 7 in the test case) with themselves.\n\n- For each pair of consecutive special numbers in the row, replace the 0s between them with 2s.\n\n- Replace all other 0s with 3s.\n\nThis would explain all the examples. Let's verify:\n\nExample 0's row 5 has 8s at 6,10,16,20. The 0s between 6 and 10 become 2s. Between 10 and 16, the 0s are 11-15. But according to this rule, they should become 2s. But in the output, they are 3s. So this contradicts.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's check Example 0's row 5 input again:\n\nInput row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nThe consecutive pairs are 6-10, 10-16, 16-20.\n\nBetween 6-10: 0s become 2.\n\nBetween 10-16: 0s should be 2. But output has 3.\n\nThis suggests the rule isn't correct. So what's different about the 10-16 pair?\n\nAh! Wait, in the input row 5, after the 8 at 10, the next 8 is at 16. Between them, the input has 0s. But in the output, those are 3s. So why?\n\nUnless there's another condition. Maybe the 2s are only between the first and second occurrence of the special number in the row. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the 0s between two special numbers become 2s only if there are no other special numbers in between. In the case of the first example's row 5, between 6 and 10, there are no other 8s. So those become 2s. Between 10 and 16, there are no 8s. So those should become 2s. But in the output, they are 3s. This is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the output for Example 0's row 5 between 10 and 16 is 3s. Looking at the output provided:\n\nOutput row: [3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,2,2,8,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,8,3,3]\n\nSo between 8 at 10 and 16 (columns 10 and 16), the 0s are replaced with 3. So according to the rule, this is unexpected.\n\nThis suggests that the rule is not simply between consecutive special numbers. So what's different here?\n\nLooking back at Example 0's input, maybe there's a vertical component. For instance, if a 0 is between two 8s in the same column, it becomes 2. But how would that work?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are only in regions that are enclosed by the special numbers. For example, forming a loop. But without seeing the actual grid, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to fill all 0s with 3, except for those that are in the same row as a special number and are between two special numbers in that row. But how to explain the discrepancy in Example 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in the same row as the special number, and are adjacent to the special number. But in Example 0's row 5, the 8s have 0s to their right and left. But only the ones between 6 and 10 are 2s. Others are 3.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are in the same row as the special number, and are between two special numbers, but the special numbers must be in the same row and column. For example, forming a horizontal corridor.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to think of another approach. What's the commonality between the examples' outputs?\n\nIn each example, the 0s that are in between the special numbers in the same row are replaced by 2s, and all other 0s become 3s. But why in Example 0's row 5, between 10 and 16 the 0s are 3s. Maybe there's a vertical check. For example, if the cell is between two special numbers in the same row and also adjacent vertically to a special number, then it's 2. Otherwise, it's 3.\n\nBut this is speculative. Let's look at another example. In Example 2's row 13:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]\n\nOutput: [3,3,3,3,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,3]\n\nHere, the 0s between 4 at position 4 and 7 are 2s. Then between 7 and 13, the 0s are 2s. Between 13 and 18 (4 at 18), the 0s are 3s. Why?\n\nLooking at the input row 13, between 13 and 18, there are 0s. But the output for those is 3. So why aren't they 2?\n\nUnless there's a vertical check. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row and there's a 4 in the same column above or below.\n\nBut in row 13's case, between 13 and 18, perhaps there are no 4s in the columns above or below. But how can we know without the full grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are only filled between the first two consecutive special numbers in a row, and subsequent pairs are ignored. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are filled between any consecutive pair of special numbers in the same row, but in Example 0's row 5, between 10 and 16, there are no special numbers, but the 0s are 3. So that can't be.\n\nThis is really tricky. Perhaps I should look for a code-like pattern. For example:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid:\n\n- If the cell is a special number (non-zero), leave it as is.\n\n- Otherwise, check if there's a special number to the left and right in the same row. If yes, replace with 2.\n\n- Or check if there's a special number to the left and right, and the current cell is between them.\n\nBut how to define this.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, replace all 0s between the first and last occurrence of the special number in that row with 2, and others with 3.\n\nFor Example 0's row 5:\n\nFirst 8 at position 6, last at 20. So the 0s between 6 and 20 would be replaced with 2. But in the output, only between 6-10 and 16-20 are 8s, but the output has 2s only between 6-10 and some others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps between the first and last occurrence of the special number in the row, all 0s are replaced with 2. But Example 0's row 5 has 8s from position 6 to 20. So the 0s between 6 and 20 would be 2. But in the output, they are 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, etc. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is frustrating. Let's look for another angle.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 2s are in the same rows as the 8s, but in specific positions. For example, row 5 has 8s at 6,10,16,20, and the 2s are between 6 and 10. The same pattern repeats in other rows. Maybe the 2s are only between the first two 8s in each row, and the rest remain 3. But in Example 2's row 13, there are multiple pairs of 4s and the 2s are between them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in cells that are part of the same horizontal segment as the special numbers. For example, if a row has a horizontal line of special numbers, the 0s between them are 2. But in Example 0's row 4, which is a horizontal line of 8s, the output has 8s and 3s, no 2s. So that's not it.\n\nMaybe the rule is that any 0 that is between two special numbers in the same row and is adjacent (directly next to) a special number becomes a 2. But in Example 0's row 5, the 8 at position 6 has 0s to the right (7,8,9), which are adjacent to the 8 at 6 and next to the 8 at 10, so they become 2. But the 8 at 10 has 0s to the right (11,12,13,14,15) which are adjacent to 10 but not to 16. So those 0s are replaced with 3. So perhaps the 0s must be between two special numbers and adjacent to at least one. But this would only convert the immediate neighbors. But in Example 0's row 5, the 0s between 6 and 10 are three cells away from each 8 but are still 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are all 0s that are in the same row as the special number and are between any two special numbers in that row. So for Example 0's row 5, between 6 and 10: 2s. Between 10 and 16: 2s. But the output has 3s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the pattern must be that in each row, the 0s that are between two occurrences of the special number (non-zero) are replaced with 2, and all other 0s are replaced with 3. This seems to fit most cases, but there are exceptions like Example 0's row 5. Maybe there's a mistake in my observation.\n\nLooking again at Example 0's row 5 output: between 10 and 16, the 0s are 3. So why?\n\nWait, in the input row 5, after the 8 at 10, the next 8 is at 16. Between them are 0s. But in the output, these 0s are 3. So why aren't they 2s?\n\nUnless the special number is only considered if it's part of a horizontal line. For example, in Example 0's row 4, there are consecutive 8s. Maybe the 2s are between non-consecutive 8s. But this is unclear.\n\nAnother idea: the 2s are the 0s that are in the same row and column as a special number's adjacent cells. For example, if a cell is next to a special number in any direction, it becomes 2. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are in cells that are part of a \"corridor\" formed by the special numbers. For example, if a row has a special number, and in the row below, there are special numbers in the same columns, then the 0s in between are 2s. But this is a vertical consideration.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial hypothesis and apply it to the test input.\n\nThe hypothesis is:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- Replace any 0 that is between two occurrences of the special number (7 in the test case) with 2.\n\n- Replace all other 0s with 3.\n\n- Keep the special number as is.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest input row 1:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nIn this row, the 7s are at positions 5 and 16. The 0s between them (positions 6-15) should be 2s. The rest of the 0s (before 5 and after 16) become 3s.\n\nSo the output row would have 3s from 0-4, 7 at 5, 2s from 6-15, 7 at 16, 3s from 17-24.\n\nTest input row 2:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0]\n\nThe 7s are at 5, 11, 16, 22. So between 5 and 11: 6-10 \u2192 2s. Between 11 and 16: 12-15 \u2192 2s. Between 16 and 22: 17-21 \u2192 2s. The rest are 3s.\n\nSo output row would be 3s until 5, 7, 2s from 6-10, 7 at 11, 2s from 12-15, 7 at 16, 2s from 17-21, 7 at 22, 3s for 23-24.\n\nTest input row 4:\n\n[0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0]\n\nAll 7s except first two and last. The 0s are at positions 0,1,24. So output would be 3s there. The 7s remain.\n\nRow 5:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0]\n\nThe 7s are at 5,11,16,22. Between each consecutive pair: 6-10, 12-15, 17-21. These become 2s. The rest 3s.\n\nRow 9:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0]\n\nThe 7s start at 5 and then from 10-23. Between 5 and 10: 0s at 6-9. These become 2s. The 7s from 10-23 are contiguous, so no 0s in between. The 0s at 0-4 and 24 become 3s.\n\nRow 14:\n\n[0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis row has 7s from 4-19, so the 0s at 0-3 and 20-24 become 3s. No 0s between 7s.\n\nRow 17:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe 7s are at 5 and 12-19. Between 5 and 12: 0s at 6-11. These become 2s. The 7s from 12-19 are contiguous.

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a list of lists (probably representing a grid) with numbers, and the output is another grid where some numbers are changed. \n\nStarting with Example 0: the input has 8s and 0s. The output replaces all 0s with 3s, except some 8s are surrounded by 3s. Wait, looking closer, maybe the 0s that are adjacent to 8s get turned into 2s? Let's check. For instance, in the input's 5th row, there's a 8 in the middle. In the output, the positions around that 8 (like the 6th row) have some 2s. So maybe the rule is that 0s adjacent to the non-zero number (like 8) become 2s, and other 0s become 3s. But wait, in the output, the 3s are everywhere except where there's the original number (8) or adjacent cells.\n\nWait, in the first example, all the 0s become 3s except for certain areas. For example, in row 5 of the input, there's a 8 in position (assuming 0-based) maybe index 6? Then in the output, the cells around it are 2s. So the pattern might be that any 0 that is adjacent (maybe including diagonally?) to a non-zero number becomes a 2, and all other 0s become 3. But wait, in the first example's output, the entire first row is 3s except the 8, which is original. So maybe the initial step is replacing all 0s with 3s, then for any cell that was a non-zero (like 8), their adjacent cells (including maybe diagonally adjacent) get turned into 2s if they were 0 in the input. Wait, but in the output, the cells adjacent to 8s are 2s. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row is all 0s except the 8. The output has 3s everywhere except the 8. But in row 5, input has 8s in positions 6 and maybe others. The output for row 5 has 8s in the same positions, but the cells around them are 2s. So maybe the rule is: Replace all 0s with 3, then for each original non-zero cell, check their adjacent cells (maybe orthogonal, not diagonal) and change those 3s to 2s.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has 1s. The output has 1s, 2s, and 3s. For example, in row 4 of the input, there's a 1 in position 4 (assuming columns are 0-based). The output for row 4 has 1 in that position, and the cells to the right (positions 5-9) are 2s. Then those 2s are in the cells that were 0 in the input but adjacent to 1. So the pattern here is similar: replace all 0s with 3s, then for each original non-zero cell (like 1), their adjacent 0s (now 3s) are replaced with 2s.\n\nLooking at Example 2, same pattern. The input has 4s. The output replaces 0s with 3s and adjacent cells to 4s become 2s.\n\nSo the general rule seems to be:\n\n1. Replace all 0s in the input with 3s in the output.\n2. For each cell that was non-zero in the input (like 8, 1, 4, etc.), check their adjacent cells (probably orthogonal directions: up, down, left, right). If those cells were 0 in the input (and thus became 3 in the output), change them to 2s.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- First, create the output grid by replacing all 0s with 3s, keeping the original non-zero values.\n- Then, for each original non-zero cell in the input, look at their orthogonal neighbors. For each neighbor that was 0 (now 3 in output), change it to 2.\n\nLet me verify this with the examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the 8 in the first row is isolated. So in the output, it's surrounded by 3s. But in row 5, the 8 has adjacent cells (like row 5, column 6) which in the input were 0. So in the output, those become 2s. So yes, the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) of the original non-zero cells get turned into 2s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the 1s in the input have adjacent cells that become 2s. For example, row 4 of the input has a 1 at column 4, and in the output, the cells to the right (columns 5-9) are 2s. Wait, that seems like maybe the adjacency is more than just orthogonal. Wait, in Example 1's input row 4, the 1 is at position 4. The output row 4 shows that the 1 is followed by 2s starting at column 5. But how is column 5 adjacent? Oh, maybe in that example, the 1 is part of a horizontal line. Wait, maybe the adjacency includes horizontal and vertical but not diagonal. Let's see. For example, in input row 4, the 1 is at position 4. The output row 4 has 1 followed by 2s. So the cells adjacent to the 1 (right direction) are turned into 2s. But how far does this go? Because in the output row 4, columns 5-9 are 2s. Wait, maybe in that example, there are multiple non-zero cells adjacent to each other, so their 2s are overlapping. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the adjacency is only immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right), and each original non-zero cell affects their adjacent cells. So, for example, in Example 1's row 4, the 1 is at column 4. The cells to the right (column 5) would be adjacent. But in the output, columns 5-9 are 2s. That suggests that maybe the 2s are propagating along a line. Wait, but according to the input, maybe those positions have 0s adjacent to the 1. Wait, the input in Example 1's row 4 is [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 1 is at position 4. The adjacent cells (columns 3 and 5) would be 0s. In the output, the row 4 becomes [3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,1,3,...]. So the cells to the right of the 1 (columns 5-9) are 2s. But how? Unless the adjacency is not just immediate but includes all cells in the same row or column as the non-zero cell until another non-zero cell? That seems complicated. Wait, but maybe the 1 is part of a vertical line, and the 2s are in the adjacent cells. Wait, perhaps the adjacent cells are only the immediate four directions. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 2's input, row 5 is [0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0]. The output row 5 is [3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3]. Then, the next row (row 6) input is [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and output row 6 is [3,3,3,3,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]. So the cells adjacent to the 4 in row 6, column 4 (input) are the cells in row 6, columns 5-12 (assuming 0-based) that are 0 in the input. But in the output, those become 2s. So it's not just immediate adjacent cells. Wait, that can't be. Wait, in row 6, the input has a 4 at column 4, and the output for row 6 has 4 followed by 2s until column 13 (the next 4). So perhaps the rule is that for each original non-zero cell, all 0s (now 3s) in the same row and column, between the non-zero cells, are turned into 2s. But that would be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are the cells that are orthogonally adjacent to the original non-zero cells, but in some cases, the non-zero cells are part of a line, and their adjacent cells are filled with 2s. Hmm. This is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the 2s are the cells that are orthogonally adjacent to any original non-zero cell, regardless of direction. For example, in Example 0's row 5, the 8 is in a vertical line. The cells to the left, right, up, and down of each 8 in the input are converted to 2s. So for each non-zero cell, check all four directions. If the cell in that direction was 0 in the input (now 3 in output), change it to 2.\n\nLet me check Example 1's row 4 again. The 1 at column 4 in the input. The output row 4 has 2s starting from column 5. That would be the cell to the right of the 1. Then, perhaps the cells to the right of the 1 are 2s, but how far? In the output, columns 5-9 are 2s, but in the input, those positions are 0 except for column 10 (which is 1). So perhaps the 2s are in all cells adjacent to the original 1, but if those cells are adjacent to another non-zero cell (like the 1 at column 10), then the 2s stop there. So between the 1s at columns 4 and 10 in row 4, the 0s in between are turned into 2s. So maybe the 2s are between two non-zero cells in the same row or column. But that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are all cells that are adjacent (orthogonally) to any non-zero cell. So for each non-zero cell in the input, their four adjacent cells (if they were 0s) become 2s. But in Example 1's row 4, the cell to the right of the 1 (column 5) is 2, and the cell to the right of that (column 6) is also 2. Wait, but why? Because the cell at column 5 in the input was 0, so it's 3 in the output, but adjacent to the 1 (column 4), so it's changed to 2. Then the cell at column 5 is now 2. But the cell at column 6 in the input was 0. Is that adjacent to any non-zero cell? No, except the 1 at column 4 is two steps away. So according to the initial idea, it would not be a 2. But in the output, it is a 2. So my initial idea is wrong.\n\nHmm. So there must be a different pattern. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input row 4:\n\nInput row 4: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row 4: [3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nSo the 1s are at columns 4, 10, 16. The cells between them (columns 5-9 and 11-15) are 2s. So between the 1s, the 0s are replaced with 2s. So maybe the rule is that in each row or column, between two non-zero cells, the 0s are replaced with 2s, and all other 0s are replaced with 3s. Similarly for columns. \n\nBut how does that work in Example 0? Let's see. In Example 0's row 5:\n\nInput row 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nOutput row 5: [3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,2,2,8,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,8,3,3]\n\nSo between the 8s at columns 6, 10, 16, 20 in row 5, the cells adjacent to each 8 are 2s. For example, between 6 and 10, the cells 7,8,9 are 2s. So perhaps between two non-zero cells in the same row, the cells in between are turned into 2s, but only if they're adjacent. Or maybe it's that any 0s that are between two non-zero cells in the same row or column are turned into 2s.\n\nWait, in Example 1's row 4, the 1s are spaced out. So between the 1 at column 4 and 10, there are 5 cells (columns 5-9), which are all 0s in the input. In the output, they are 2s. So the entire stretch between two 1s in the same row is converted to 2s. Similarly, between 10 and 16, columns 11-15 are 2s. So the rule could be: for any consecutive non-zero cells in a row or column, the 0s between them are replaced with 2s, and all other 0s are replaced with 3s.\n\nBut how does this apply to Example 0? In row 5, between the 8s at columns 6 and 10, there are three 0s (columns 7,8,9). In the output, these become 2s. Similarly, between 10 and 16, there are 5 0s, but in the output, they are 3s. Wait, no. Wait in Example 0's row 5 input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0]. Output is [3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,2,2,8,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,8,3,3]. So between the 8s at 6 and 10, the 0s (columns 7,8,9) become 2s. Between 10 and 16, there's a lot of zeros (columns 11-15). But in the output, they are 3s. So why are those not 2s? Because there's no non-zero cells in between. The next 8 is at column 16. So between 10 and 16, the cells are 0s. But in the output, those are 3s. So the initial idea that the 2s are between two non-zero cells in the same row or column might not hold. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are cells that are orthogonally adjacent to a non-zero cell. For example, the 8 at column 6 in row 5: the cells to the left, right, above, and below would be 2s. So in row 5, column 6's 8 would have adjacent cells at row 5, columns 5 and 7, and row 4 and 6, column 6. But in the output, the cells to the right (column 7-9) are 2s, which are adjacent to the 8. But columns 7-9 are three cells to the right of the 8. Wait, that's not adjacent. So maybe that's not the case. \n\nWait, perhaps the 2s are not just adjacent, but the entire area between two non-zero cells in the same row or column. For instance, in a row, if there are two non-zero cells, all the 0s between them become 2s. But in Example 0's row 5, between 8s at 6 and 10, columns 7-9 are 2s. But between 10 and 16, columns 11-15 are 0s and become 3s. So that's a problem. So maybe it's only the immediate adjacent cells. But why in Example 1, the entire stretch between 4 and 10 becomes 2s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are cells that are adjacent to a non-zero cell, but also part of a \"corridor\" between two non-zero cells. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\n- All original non-zero cells remain the same.\n- All 0s in the input are replaced with 3s, except those that are adjacent (orthogonally) to a non-zero cell, which become 2s. But wait, in Example 1's row 4, the cells between the 1s are all 2s. So if each 1's adjacent cells become 2s, but since the 1s are spaced out, perhaps the cells between them are each adjacent to a previous 2. But according to the rules, the transformation is only based on the original input. So the 2s in the output are determined based on the original input's non-zero cells, not the transformed cells.\n\nAh, that's a key point. The replacement is done based on the original input. So first, replace all 0s with 3s, then for each original non-zero cell, check their adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) in the original input. If those cells were 0 (and thus became 3 in the output), change them to 2. But this would only affect the immediate neighbors. Let's test this.\n\nTake Example 1's row 4. The 1 is at column 4. Its adjacent cells are column 3 and 5. In the original input, those are 0s. So in the output, columns 3 and 5 would become 2s. But in the output, columns 5-9 are 2s. That suggests that the rule is not just immediate adjacency. So maybe it's a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the 2s form a sort of \"border\" around the non-zero cells. For instance, in Example 0's output, the vertical lines of 8s have 2s on their sides. Wait, but in Example 0's row 5, the 8 at column 6 has 2s to the right (columns 7-9), which are adjacent to the 8. So maybe the 2s are all cells adjacent (orthogonally) to a non-zero cell. But then, why in Example 1's row 4, the 2s extend beyond the immediate adjacent cells?\n\nWait, perhaps the 2s are not only the immediate adjacent cells but all cells that are reachable from the non-zero cells by moving in a straight line (horizontal or vertical) through 0s. But that would make the 2s fill the entire area between non-zero cells in the same row or column. For example, in Example 1's row 4, between the 1 at column 4 and the 1 at column 10, all the cells in between (columns 5-9) become 2s. Similarly, between 10 and 16, columns 11-15 become 2s. \n\nBut how does that work in Example 0's row 5? The 8s are at columns 6, 10, 16, 20. The cells between 6 and 10 (columns 7-9) become 2s. Between 10 and 16, columns 11-15 are 3s, which suggests that those are not between two non-zero cells. Wait, but in the input, between 10 and 16, there are no non-zero cells. So the rule would be: for each row and column, any 0s that are between two non-zero cells in the same row or column are turned into 2s, and the rest of the 0s become 3s.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Replace all 0s with 3s.\n2. For each row and column, find any sequences of 3s that are between two non-zero cells in that row or column. Replace those 3s with 2s.\n\nBut how to handle overlapping in rows and columns. For example, a cell that is between two non-zero cells in a row and also between two in a column. Maybe in that case, it's still a 2.\n\nThis would explain the examples. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's row 4, between the 1s at columns 4 and 10, all the 3s (originally 0s) between them become 2s. Similarly, between 10 and 16, columns 11-15 (3s) become 2s.\n\nIn Example 0's row 5, the 8s at columns 6, 10, 16, 20. Between 6 and 10, the 3s (columns 7-9) become 2s. Between 10 and 16, there are no non-zero cells in the row, so they remain 3s. Between 16 and 20, columns 17-19 are 3s, but in the output, they remain 3s. Wait, but in the output, between 16 and 20, there are 8s at 16 and 20. Wait, the input row 5 has 8 at columns 6, 10, 16, 20. So between 16 and 20, the 0s (now 3s) would be columns 17-19. But in the output, they are 3s, not 2s. Hmm, this contradicts the earlier idea. Because between 16 and 20, the 0s are between two non-zero cells (8s), so according to the rule, they should be 2s. But in the output, they are 3s. So maybe this idea is incorrect.\n\nSo what's different between the 8s at 6 and 10 versus 16 and 20 in Example 0's row 5?\n\nLooking at the input row 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0]. So the 8s are at 6,10,16,20. In the output row 5: [3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,2,2,8,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,8,3,3]. So between 6 and 10, columns 7-9 are 2s. Between 10 and 16, there are 5 cells (columns 11-15) which are 3s. Between 16 and 20, columns 17-19 are 3s. So why are some between 8s turned into 2s and others not?\n\nLooking at the input, perhaps the difference is that between 6 and 10, there are 3 cells (columns 7-9), and between 10 and 16, there are 5 cells (columns 11-15), which are all 0s. But in the output, only the ones between 6 and 10 are 2s. So what's special about them?\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that in the same row or column, if two non-zero cells are adjacent (i.e., next to each other), then the 0s between them are turned into 2s. But in Example 0's row 5, the 8s at 6 and 10 are separated by three 0s. So maybe that's not adjacent. But why would those be 2s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are cells that are in the same row or column as a non-zero cell and are adjacent to it. So for each non-zero cell, look in all four directions and mark the adjacent cell as 2 if it was a 0. But then, in Example 0's row 5, the 8 at column 6 has adjacent cells at 5 and 7. Column 5 is 3 in the output, column 7 is 2. But wait, the output row 5 is [3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,2,2,8,3,...]. So the cells at columns 7,8,9 are 2s. But the 8 at column 6's adjacent cells are column 5 and 7. Column 5 is 3, column 7 is 2. So how do columns 8 and 9 become 2s? Because they are adjacent to the 8 at column 10? No, column 10 is two cells away. So maybe there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are cells that are in the same row or column as a non-zero cell and are within a certain distance, like all cells between the non-zero cell and the next non-zero cell in that direction. For example, in Example 0's row 5, the 8 at column 6 has a next 8 at column 10. So the cells from 7 to 9 (right of 6) are between them and become 2s. Similarly, the 8 at column 10 has a next 8 at 16, but those cells are not between them (since there are other 0s), but perhaps there's a vertical component.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps the key is that for each non-zero cell, we look in all four directions (left, right, up, down) and convert all 0s (now 3s) in that direction until we hit another non-zero cell. So for example, in Example 1's row 4, the 1 at column 4 has a 1 to the right at column 10. So between them, all cells are converted to 2s. Similarly, in Example 0's row 5, the 8 at column 6 has an 8 to the right at column 10, so the cells between them (columns 7-9) become 2s. But in the same row, the 8 at column 10 has the next 8 to the right at column 16. But between them (columns 11-15) are 0s. So why are they 3s? Because there's no non-zero cell in between. Wait, but according to this rule, between 10 and 16, columns 11-15 should become 2s. But in the output, they are 3s. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the test input.\n\nThe test input has rows with 7s. For example, row 1 of the test input has a 7 at column 5. The output should replace the 0s with 3s and the adjacent cells to 7s with 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero cell in the input creates a cross shape of 2s around it. So for each non-zero cell, all cells in the same row and column (but only adjacent?) are converted to 2s if they were 0s. For example, in Example 1's row 4, the 1 at column 4 has its right adjacent cells turned into 2s until the next 1 at column 10. But this still doesn't explain why the entire stretch becomes 2s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are the cells that are in the same row or column as a non-zero cell and are within a distance of one. So, for each non-zero cell, the cells to the left, right, up, and down are 2s if they were 0s.\n\nLet's check Example 0's row 5. The 8 at column 6 would affect the cells at (5,6), (7,6), (6,5), (6,7). But in the output row 5, column 7 is 2. So maybe the right direction is turned into 2s until the next non-zero cell. So from 6 to 10, all cells in between become 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are the cells that are in the same row or column as a non-zero cell and are contiguous 0s in the input. So, in a row, the 0s that are contiguous and adjacent to a non-zero cell become 2s. But this is unclear.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the best approach is to code the transformation based on the observed patterns in the examples. Let's look at the Test Input and try to apply what we think is the pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n\nThe test input has 7s. Let's look at row 1:\n\nInput row 1: [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row 1 should replace 0s with 3s except around the 7s. The 7s are at columns 5 and 16. So the cells adjacent to these 7s (left, right, up, down) should be 2s.\n\nBut according to the training examples, perhaps between the two 7s in row 1, all 0s (now 3s) become 2s. So in row 1, columns 5 and 16 are 7s. The cells between them (columns 6-15) would become 2s. Similarly, any cells above or below the 7s would also be 2s.\n\nBut the test input has multiple rows. Let's take row 4:\n\nInput row 4: [0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0]\n\nThis is a line of 7s. The output should replace the surrounding 0s with 2s. So in the output, the 7s remain, and the cells adjacent to them (left and right) would be 2s. But since the 7s are contiguous, their left and right are other 7s. So in row 4, the output would be all 7s except the first and last cells, which are 2s. But looking at the training examples, when there's a solid line of non-zero cells, the output has the same line, and the adjacent 0s become 2s. So for example, in Example 0's row 4, which is a horizontal line of 8s, the output has 8s and the adjacent cells (above and below) are 2s. But in the test input row 4, the 7s are in a solid line. The adjacent cells in row 3 and 5 would have 2s next to them.\n\nBut how to apply this for the entire test input.\n\nAnother approach is to look for each 0 in the input and determine if it is adjacent (orthogonally) to any non-zero cell. If yes, replace with 2; otherwise, replace with 3.\n\nSo the rule would be:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid:\n\n- If the cell is non-zero, keep it.\n- If the cell is zero, check if any of its four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are non-zero.\n  - If yes, replace with 2.\n  - Else, replace with 3.\n\nThis matches Example 0's row 5. The 8 at column 6 has adjacent cells to the right (column 7) which is zero. So column 7 becomes 2. Column 7's adjacent cell (column 6) is 8, but column 8's adjacent cell (column 7) is now 2, which was originally zero. Wait, but according to this rule, the replacement is based on the original input. So column 7 was zero in the input and has an adjacent 8 (column 6), so becomes 2. Column 8 was zero in the input and has an adjacent cell (column 7) which was zero in the input. So column 8 would remain 3. But in the output, columns 7-9 are 2s. This contradicts.\n\nAh, so the problem with this approach is that the adjacent cells are checked in the original input, not the output. So in the example, column 7 is adjacent to 8 (original input), so becomes 2. Column 8 is adjacent to column 7, which was zero in the input, but the original input's column 8 is zero. So column 8 would only become 2 if it's adjacent to a non-zero cell in the original input. But in the original input, column 8 is zero, and its adjacent cells are columns 7 and 9 (both zero in the input), and row 4 and 6. If row 4's column 8 is zero, then column 8 would remain 3. But in Example 0's row 5, columns 7-9 are 2s. So this suggests that the initial rule is not sufficient.\n\nSo perhaps there's another layer. Maybe the 2s are not just adjacent cells but cells that are part of a region connected to non-zero cells via adjacent 0s. But that would involve a flood fill algorithm, which may be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are all cells that are orthogonally adjacent to any non-zero cell in the original input, and their adjacent cells in the same row or column until another non-zero cell is found. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are the cells that are in the same row or column as a non-zero cell and are between two non-zero cells in that row or column.\n\nIn Example 1's row 4, the cells between the 1s are 2s. In Example 0's row 5, between the 8s. But in the test input row 1, between the two 7s in columns 5 and 16, the cells between them would become 2s.\n\nBut in the test input, row 2:\n\nInput row 2: [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0]\n\nThe 7s are at columns 5, 11, 16, 22. So between them, the cells should become 2s. So for row 2, the output would have 7s and the cells between them would be 2s.\n\nApplying the initial rule: for each zero cell, if it has any adjacent non-zero cell in the original input, it becomes 2; else 3. For example, the cell in row 2, column 6 is adjacent to column 5's 7, so becomes 2. Column 6's adjacent cells include column 5 (7) and column 7 (0). Column 7 in row 2 is zero and adjacent to column 6 (now 2 in output). But according to the rule, it's based on the original input. So column 7 in row 2's input is zero. Its adjacent non-zero cells are column 5 (7) is two steps away. So no, column 7 would remain 3. But according to the training examples, in Example 1's row 4, the cells between 4 and 10 are all 2s, even though they are not adjacent to the non-zero cell. So this suggests that the rule is not based on adjacency but something else.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to find a pattern in the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0's row 5: input has 8s at columns 6, 10, 16, 20. The output for row 5 has 8s followed by 2s in columns 7-9, then 8 at 10, then 3s until 16. Why? Because the 8 at 6 and 10 are in the same row, and the cells between them are 2s. Similarly, the 8 at 10 and 16 are not adjacent, and the cells between them are 3s. So perhaps the rule is that between two non-zero cells in the same row or column, the cells between them are 2s. But only if there are no other non-zero cells in between.\n\nWait, between 6 and 10 in row 5 of Example 0's input, there are no other non-zero cells. So the cells between them are 0s. So those become 2s. Between 10 and 16, there's a 8 at 16, but there are other cells (like the 8 at 16 is two rows down?), so perhaps the cells between 10 and 16 are not in the same row or column.\n\nAlternatively, in the same row, the cells between two non-zero cells are turned into 2s, regardless of their distance. So between any two non-zero cells in the same row, all the 0s between them become 2s. Similarly for columns.\n\nIf that's the case, then in Example 0's row 5, between 6 and 10, 0s become 2s. Between 10 and 16, 0s become 2s. But in the output, they are 3s. So this doesn't align.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let's try to look for another pattern. In Example 0's output, the 2s are adjacent to the 8s. For example, in row 5, columns 7-9 are 2s adjacent to the 8 at 6. But the 8 at 10 is followed by 3s. So perhaps the 2s are only to the right of each 8. Or perhaps the 2s are in the immediate vicinity of each non-zero cell, but not beyond.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the non-zero numbers form a kind of maze-like structure, and the 2s are the walls or paths adjacent to them. For instance, in Example 0's output, the 2s are in the vertical and horizontal paths next to the 8s. So the 2s might represent the adjacent cells to the non-zero cells, which act as borders.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, perhaps the best way is to proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is:\n\n- Replace all 0s with 3s.\n- For each cell that was non-zero in the input, look in all four directions (up, down, left, right) and if the adjacent cell in that direction was 0 (now 3), replace it with 2.\n\nThis would mean that each non-zero cell's immediate neighbors (orthogonal) become 2s.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's row 5:\n\nInput row 5: 8 at columns 6, 10, 16, 20. Each of these 8s would have their adjacent cells turned into 2s. So:\n\n- 8 at 6: adjacent cells are 5 and 7. But in the input, 5 is 0, so output 2. 7 is 0, so output 2.\n- 8 at 10: adjacent cells 9 and 11. 9 is 0 \u2192 2. 11 is 0 \u2192 2.\n- 8 at 16: adjacent cells 15 and 17. 15 is 0 \u2192 2. 17 is 0 \u2192 2.\n- 8 at 20: adjacent cells 19 and 21. 19 is 0 \u2192 2. 21 is 0 \u2192 2.\n\nBut the output row 5 is [3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,2,2,8,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,8,3,3]. So the cells 7-9 are 2s. But according to the above rule, only 7 (adjacent to 8 at 6) and 9 (adjacent to 8 at 10) would be 2s. However, cell 8 is between them, which was 0 in input and adjacent to cell 7 (which was 0 in input), so according to the rule, cell 8 would remain 3. But in the output, cell 8 is 2. \n\nThis suggests that the initial hypothesis is incorrect. Therefore, there must be another rule.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 2s are the cells that are orthogonally adjacent to the non-zero cells, but also any 0s that are between two non-zero cells in the same row or column. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the non-zero cells as forming a shape, and the 2s are their outlines. For example, in Example 0's output, the 8s form a sort of maze, and the 2s are the inner walls. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are the cells that are in the same row or column as a non-zero cell and are between that non-zero cell and the edge of the grid. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, given time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to code the transformation as follows:\n\n- All 0s become 3s.\n- For each cell that was non-zero in the input, check all four adjacent cells. If those cells are 3s (originally 0s), replace them with 2s.\n\nThis would explain the 2s around each non-zero cell. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's row 5, the 8 at 6 has adjacent cells at 5 (3 \u2192 becomes 2), 7 (3 \u2192 becomes 2), row 4 column 6 (8's up), and row 6 column 6 (8's down). The up cell is row 4 column 6, which in the input is 0. So in the output, it becomes 3, then changed to 2 because it's adjacent to the 8 in row 5. So the cells around the 8s would be 2s.\n\nBut in the output row 5, columns 7-9 are 2s. How? The 8 at column 6's right is 7 \u2192 2. The 8 at column 10's left is 9 \u2192 2. So between the two 8s, columns 7-9 are 2s. But according to the rule, only the immediate adjacent cells (7 and 9) would be 2s. But the output shows 7-9 as 2s, which suggests that there's another 8 in row 5, column 10's left adjacent cell (column 9) is 0, which becomes 3, then changed to 2 because of the 8 at 10. So column 9 is adjacent to both 8 at 6 (but to the right of 6 is 7) and 8 at 10 (to the left is 9). So column 9 would be a 2 because it's adjacent to the 8 at 10. But column 8 is between columns 7 and 9. How does it become a 2?\n\nAh, perhaps because in the original input, the cell at column 8 is 0, and in the output, it's a 3. But when processing the 8 at column 6, we check its adjacent cells (columns 5 and 7). Column 7 becomes 2. Then, when processing the 8 at column 10, its adjacent cells are 9 and 11. Column 9 becomes 2. But column 8 is not adjacent to any non-zero cell. So according to the rule, column 8 would remain 3. But in the output, it's 2. This suggests that the initial rule is incorrect.\n\nSo, there's a problem. What's causing column 8 to be 2?\n\nLooking at the input row 5's columns 6-10:\n\nColumns: 6 (8), 7 (0), 8 (0), 9 (0), 10 (8).\n\nProcessing each non-zero cell:\n\n- 8 at 6: adjacent cells 5 (0 \u2192 3 \u2192 2), 7 (0 \u2192 3 \u2192 2), up and down (depends on other rows).\n- 8 at 10: adjacent cells 9 (0 \u2192 3 \u2192 2), 11 (0 \u2192 3 \u2192 2), up and down.\n\nSo in the output row 5, columns 7 and 9 are 2s, but column 8 is 3. But in the example's output, column 8 is 2. So this contradicts the initial rule. Therefore, there's another pattern.\n\nAnother possibility: cells that are between two non-zero cells in the same row or column, regardless of distance, are converted to 2s. For example, in row 5 of Example 0, columns 7-9 are between 8s at 6 and 10. So they become 2s. Similarly, in Example 1's row 4, columns 5-9 are between 1s and become 2s. But in Example 0's row 5, between 10 and 16, there are no non-zero cells, so columns 11-15 remain 3s.\n\nThis would mean that the rule is: in each row and column, any 0s (now 3s) that are between two non-zero cells are converted to 2s. So for each cell, if there exists a non-zero cell to the left and right in the same row, or above and below in the same column, then it becomes a 2.\n\nBut how to determine this for each cell.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's row 5, column 7:\n\n- To the left, there's an 8 at column 6.\n- To the right, there's an 8 at column 10.\n- So column 7 is between two non-zero cells in the same row and becomes 2.\n\nSimilarly, column 8 is between 6 and 10 and becomes 2.\n\nColumn 9 is between 6 and 10 and becomes 2.\n\nIn row 5, column 11:\n\n- To the left is 10 (8), but to the right is 16 (8). But columns 11-15 are between 10 and 16. So why are they 3s in the output?\n\nBecause in the input, between 10 and 16 in row 5, there are no non-zero cells. Wait, but the 8 at 10 is in row 5, and the next non-zero cell in the same row is at column 16. So between them, columns 11-15 are 0s. According to this rule, they should be 2s. But in the output, they are 3s. So this contradicts.\n\nThus, this theory is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should proceed with the initial hypothesis and see if it works for the test case.\n\nThe test input has 7s in various positions. Let's take the first row of the test input:\n\nTest Input row 0: all 0s \u2192 becomes all 3s.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nAccording to the initial rule, replace 0s with 3s, then for each 7, check adjacent cells. The 7s at columns 5 and 16 will have their adjacent cells (columns 4,6, and 15,17) turned into 2s. So in row 1, columns 4,6,15,17 would be 2s, others 3s. But according to the training examples, this might not be correct. For example, in Example 1's row 4, the 1s have their entire row between them turned into 2s. But according to this initial rule, only the adjacent cells would be 2s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to turn all cells in the same row or column as a non-zero cell into 2s. But that would be too broad.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the non-zero cells creating a 'plus' shape of 2s around them. So for each non-zero cell, the entire row and column of that cell, from the cell's position to the edges, are filled with 2s. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAnother possibility: the 2s are all cells that are within a certain distance (e.g., one cell) of a non-zero cell in any direction, including diagonally. But in Example 0's row 5, the cells around 8s would have 2s in all eight directions, which isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are the cells that are in the same row or column as a non-zero cell, regardless of distance, but not diagonally. So for each non-zero cell, all cells in the same row and column are 2s. But this would fill entire rows and columns with 2s, which doesn't match the examples.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I'll proceed with the initial rule: replace 0s with 3s, then for each original non-zero cell, turn their adjacent cells into 2s. Even though it doesn't fully explain the examples, it's the closest I can get.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFor each 7 in the input, their adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) that were 0s become 2s.\n\nSo in row 1, the 7s at columns 5 and 16:\n\n- Column 5: adjacent cells are row 0 and 2, column 5 (but those are 0s in the input), and columns 4 and 6 in row 1.\n\nSo in row 1, columns 4 and 6 become 2s. Similarly, for the 7 at column 16, columns 15 and 17 become 2s.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's row 4, between two 1s, there are multiple 2s. So perhaps this rule is insufficient.\n\nAt this point, I'm not confident, but I'll proceed with the initial pattern and format the answer accordingly.",
