        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to take a grid of numbers (the input) and transform it into another grid (the output) based on some rules observed from the training examples. Let's look at each example to see if I can spot the pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has several rows with 8s forming some kind of shape, maybe a diamond? Then lower down, there are 4s, 2s, 1s, and 3s arranged in vertical lines. The output seems to be a smaller grid. The first output row is [0,4,4,4,4,0], which might correspond to the row with 4s in the input. Then the next rows have 8s and other numbers. Maybe the output is combining elements from different regions of the input.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, there's a section with 3s, then 6s and 4s in vertical lines, followed by 2s. The output starts with [0,3,3,3,0], then combines 6 and 4 with 3, then 6,6,8,4,4. Hmm, the 8 here comes from the input's 8 in the middle. So perhaps the output is taking certain rows and columns from the input, maybe overlapping regions.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 7s row, then 4s and 6s in vertical lines, then 1s, and later 8s arranged in a pattern. The output starts with [0,7,7,7,7,0], which matches the first row of 7s. Then the next rows combine 8s from the lower part with the 4s and 6s. Wait, the input's lower 8s are in a kind of cross shape, and the output rows mix those with the vertical numbers from upper parts.\n\nSo, perhaps the pattern is that the output is formed by taking certain regions of the input and merging them. For instance, each row in the output corresponds to a combination of elements from different horizontal bands in the input. Let's look for specific transformations.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's input, the 8s form a diamond shape in the upper part. The output's second row is [2,8,0,0,8,1]. The 2 and 1 might come from the vertical lines of 2s and 1s in the input's lower middle. The 8s here are from the diamond. So maybe each output row is combining elements from different layers: the vertical lines (like the 2s and 1s) and the horizontal shapes (like the diamond of 8s, or the 4s, 3s).\n\nWait, looking at the vertical lines in the input. In Example 0, the 2s are in column 6, and 1s in column 11. In the output rows, the 2 and 1 appear on the left and right ends. Similarly, the 4s and 3s form horizontal lines, and their numbers are in the output's top and bottom rows.\n\nSo maybe the output is constructed by taking the vertical line elements (like 2 and 1) and combining them with horizontal elements (like 8s from a diamond, 4s, 3s). The vertical elements might be placed at the ends of the output rows, while the horizontal elements are in the middle.\n\nAnother approach: The output seems to have fewer rows than the input. For example, the first example's input is 15 rows, the output is 6 rows. Maybe each output row is a combination of two input rows. Or perhaps certain rows are selected based on where the non-zero elements start and end.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output dimensions. Example 0's input is 15x16, output 6x6. Example1 input is 14x16, output 5x5. Example2 input is 15x15, output 6x6. So the output size isn't directly proportional. Maybe the output is centered around the non-zero regions.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is created by focusing on the central parts of the input where there are non-zero elements. For instance, in Example0's input, the upper part has the 8s, the middle has 4s, then 2s and 1s, then 3s. The output starts with the 4s (row7 in input), then the 2s and 8s (rows 8-11 combined with the upper 8s?), then the 3s (row12). So maybe each output row is a horizontal slice of the input, but combined with vertical elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is formed by taking the non-zero elements from certain columns in the input. For example, in Example0's output row [2,8,0,0,8,1], the 2 and 1 are from columns 6 and 11 (which in the input's rows 8-11 have 2 and 1), and the 8s are from columns 1 and 4 in the upper rows. So maybe each output row is combining elements from different columns in the input.\n\nLooking at the positions: For Example0's input, the 8s in the upper part are in rows 1-4, columns 1,2,4. The vertical lines (2s and 1s) are in columns 6 and 11, rows 8-11. The 4s and 3s are in rows 7 and 12, columns 7-10 (4s) and 8-11 (3s). The output rows seem to merge these elements. For instance, the second output row has 2 (from column6) and 1 (column11) as first and last elements, and 8s from columns 1 and4.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that each output row is formed by taking elements from specific columns in the input. The columns might be determined by the positions of vertical lines (like 2 and 1 in columns6 and11). Then, for the middle elements, taking the values from a horizontal structure (like the 8s in the upper part). Also, the top and bottom rows of the output correspond to horizontal lines (like 4s and3s in rows7 and12).\n\nAnother angle: The output rows might be constructed by combining the leftmost non-zero element of a certain type, the middle elements from another structure, and the rightmost non-zero element of another type. For example, in Example0's output row [2,8,0,0,8,1], 2 is from the left vertical line (column6, row8), 8s from upper diamond (columns1 and4), and 1 from the right vertical line (column11, row8). Then the next row has 2 and 1 again but different middle elements.\n\nThis suggests that each output row is built from three parts: left, middle, right. The left and right parts come from vertical lines (like 2s and 1s), and the middle part comes from a horizontal structure (like the diamond of 8s, or the 4s and3s).\n\nLooking at how the numbers are arranged. Let's take Example0's output:\n\nRow0: [0,4,4,4,4,0] \u2192 corresponds to the horizontal line of 4s in input row7.\n\nRow1: [2,8,0,0,8,1] \u2192 left is 2 (column6), middle 8s from upper diamond columns1 and4, right is1 (column11).\n\nRow2: [2,0,8,0,1,1] \u2192 middle now has 8 from a different position, maybe row2's column2, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the middle elements are taken from the upper structures (like the 8s) in different rows. For example, each output row after the first takes the 8s from a different row of the diamond.\n\nBut how are the positions determined? Maybe the columns of the upper diamond's 8s are mapped to certain positions in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by layering different parts of the input. The vertical lines (like 2 and1) are on the left and right edges of the output, and the middle part is the horizontal structures (like 8s diamond, 4s, 3s) compressed or transformed.\n\nAnother thought: the output might be a combination of the vertical and horizontal elements. For instance, each output row combines the left vertical line (2s), the horizontal elements (like 8s in the middle), and the right vertical line (1s). The top and bottom rows of the output are the horizontal lines (4s and 3s).\n\nLooking at the test input now. The test input has a horizontal line of 1s in row0, then vertical lines of 2s (column5) and 4s (column11) in rows1-5. Then a horizontal line of 3s in row6. Then some 8s arranged in a cross or other pattern in rows9-13.\n\nFollowing the pattern from the examples, the output should start with the horizontal line (1s and 3s?), then combine the vertical lines (2 and4) with the 8s structures. The 8s in the test input's lower part might form a diamond or cross, so the middle rows of the output would have 8s combined with 2 and4.\n\nFor example, the output's first row might be [0,1,1,1,1,1,0] but the training examples have their top row as the first horizontal line (like 4s in example0, 3s in example1, 7s in example2). Wait, in example0's output, the top row is 4s, which in the input is a horizontal line in row7. The output rows then proceed to combine vertical lines and other structures.\n\nBut in the test input, the first horizontal line is row0 with 1s, then row6 with 3s. So maybe the output starts with the horizontal line of 1s (from row0) and ends with the horizontal line of 3s (row6). The middle rows would combine the vertical lines (2 and4) with the 8s structure.\n\nWait, looking at the training examples:\n\n- Example0's first output row is the 4s from input row7 (middle part), and last output row is 3s from input row12.\n\n- Example1's first output row is the 3s from input row6, and last is the 2s from input row10.\n\n- Example2's first output is 7s from row1, and last is 1s from row6.\n\nSo perhaps the output starts with the first horizontal line (the highest non-zero horizontal line in the input), and ends with the last horizontal line. Then, the middle rows are combinations of the vertical lines and other structures.\n\nIn the test input, the first horizontal line is row0 with 1s, and the last is row6 with 3s. So the output's first row would be [0,1,1,1,1,1,0] (but adjusted to fit the example's pattern of length 6). Wait, example0's input has 4s in row7 (columns7-10), and the output's first row is [0,4,4,4,4,0], which is length 6. So maybe the first and last elements are 0, and the middle elements are the horizontal line.\n\nSo in the test input, the first output row would be [0,1,1,1,1,1,0], but in the examples, the outputs have varying lengths. Wait, example0's output is 6 elements per row, example1 is 5, example2 is 6. The test input's first horizontal line (row0) is 1s from columns6-10 (indices 6 to10 inclusive, which is 5 elements). But example0's first input horizontal line (4s) spans 4 elements (columns7-10) but the output row is 6 elements. How does that happen?\n\nLooking closer at example0's input: the 4s are in row7, columns7-10 (four elements). The output row is [0,4,4,4,4,0], which is 6 elements. So they added a zero on each end. Similarly, example2's first input row (row1) has 7s in columns3-6 (four elements), output row [0,7,7,7,7,0], which is six elements. So the horizontal line is padded with zeros on both ends.\n\nSo for the test input's first horizontal line (row0, 1s in columns6-10, five elements), perhaps the output's first row would be [0,1,1,1,1,1,0], but since the example outputs have varying lengths, maybe the number of elements depends on the horizontal line's length plus two zeros. But in the test input, the 1s are from columns6 to10 inclusive (indices 6,7,8,9,10 \u2192 5 elements). So output would be [0,1,1,1,1,1,0] which is 7 elements, but in the examples, the first output rows are 6 elements for four in input. Hmm, maybe the test input's output starts and ends with 0 and includes all the 1s, but in the examples, they took the middle elements and added 0s. Wait, maybe the horizontal line's start and end are adjusted to center it. For example, in example0, the 4s span columns7-10 (4 elements), and the output row is 6 elements: 0 followed by four 4s and 0. So 0 + 4 + 0. For the test input's 1s (5 elements), the output row would be 0 followed by five 1s and 0, totaling 7 elements. But looking at the test input's other structures, maybe the vertical lines and 8s affect the output row length.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's row length is determined by combining the vertical lines and the horizontal structures. For example, in example0, the vertical lines are columns6 and11 (positions 6 and11 in a 16-column input). The horizontal structures (4s,8s,3s) are in between. So the output's columns are 6 (left vertical), then the horizontal structure's columns, then 11 (right vertical). So for example0's output row [2,8,0,0,8,1], the columns would be 6 (2), then 1, 2, 4 (from 8s), then 11 (1). Wait, perhaps the output row is left vertical element, followed by elements from the horizontal structure's columns, then right vertical element. But how are the horizontal structure's columns selected?\n\nAlternatively, the horizontal structure's columns are centered between the left and right vertical columns. For example0, the left vertical is column6, right is column11. The horizontal structure (8s) spans columns1,2,4. Maybe the output takes columns between left and right verticals. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by taking the left vertical element (from column6), then the horizontal structure's elements in between, then the right vertical element (column11). The horizontal structure's elements might be from a certain row. For example, in example0's output row1: 2 (column6, row8), then 8 (column1, row1?), then 8 (column4, row1?), then 1 (column11, row8). But how are the middle elements selected?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to look at another approach. Let's map the output rows to specific input rows and columns.\n\nIn example0:\n\nOutput row0: [0,4,4,4,4,0] \u2192 corresponds to input row7, which has 4s in columns7-10. So output row0 is 0, followed by 4,4,4,4 (columns7-10?), then 0. But how do the columns map?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is constructed by taking elements from specific columns. For example, the first and last elements are from the left and right vertical lines (columns6 and11), and the middle elements are from the horizontal structure (like 8s, 4s). But how are the middle elements determined?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a compressed version where overlapping structures are merged. For example, the vertical lines (2s and 1s) are at the edges, and the middle is filled with the horizontal structures (8s diamond, 4s line, etc.). So each output row combines the left vertical element, then the horizontal structure elements from that row, then the right vertical element.\n\nWait, maybe each output row corresponds to a row in the input, but combining the vertical elements (from their respective columns) and horizontal elements. For example, in example0's output row1: [2,8,0,0,8,1], the 2 comes from row8, column6; the 8s come from row1, columns1 and4; the 1 comes from row8, column11. So perhaps the output rows are combinations of elements from different input rows and columns. But how are they chosen?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are constructed by taking the vertical elements (2 and1) from the same row in the input and inserting them around the horizontal elements from another part of the input. For example, in example0's output row1, the 2 and1 are from row8 (vertical lines), and the 8s are from the upper part (rows1-4). So maybe the middle elements are from a certain layer (like the diamond of 8s) and the vertical elements are from their respective rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns to pick? This is tricky. Let's look at the test input and see what the expected output might be.\n\nThe test input's vertical lines are 2s in column5 (rows1-5) and 4s in column11 (same rows). Then there's a horizontal line of 3s in row6 (columns6-10). The lower part has 8s arranged in a pattern from rows9-13.\n\nFollowing the examples, the output should start with the horizontal line of 1s (row0) \u2192 output row0: [0,1,1,1,1,1,0] (but the examples have 0 followed by the horizontal elements and 0, but in example0, the horizontal line was 4 elements, output was 6 elements). The test's 1s are 5 elements (columns6-10), so output row0 would be [0,1,1,1,1,1,0] (7 elements). Then, the next rows would combine the vertical lines (2 and4) with the 8s structure.\n\nBut in the examples, the output rows after the first combine the vertical elements (left and right) with the horizontal elements (like 8s). For instance, in example0's row1: [2,8,0,0,8,1]. Here, 2 is from column6, row8; 1 is from column11, row8; and the 8s are from columns1 and4 in row1. So perhaps for each vertical line row (rows8-11 in example0), the output has a row combining the left vertical element (2), the 8s from upper rows, and the right vertical element (1).\n\nIn the test input, the vertical lines (2 and4) are in rows1-5. So maybe each of these rows contributes to an output row. Then, the 8s in rows9-13 would form the middle elements. For example, the output rows after the first would be:\n\n[2, ... ,4] with ... being the 8s pattern.\n\nBut how exactly? Let's think of the output rows as:\n\n- First row: horizontal line (1s) with 0s on both ends.\n\n- Then, rows corresponding to the vertical lines (rows1-5), each combining 2 (from column5), 4 (from column11), and the 8s from lower rows.\n\n- Then, the horizontal line of 3s (row6) with 0s on ends.\n\nBut the test input's 8s are in rows9-13. For example, row9 has 8s in columns2,3,5,6. How would that be combined with the vertical lines?\n\nAlternatively, the 8s in the lower part form a diamond-like structure. The output's middle rows would combine the vertical 2 and4 with the 8s from these rows. For example, each output row (after the first) would have 2 and4 as left and right, and the 8s from a certain row in the lower part as the middle elements.\n\nIn example0, the diamond of 8s is in rows1-4, columns1,2,4. The vertical lines (2 and1) are in rows8-11. The output rows 1-4 combine 2 and1 from row8-11 and 8s from rows1-4. For instance, row1 of output (example0) has 8s from row1 (columns1 and4), row2 from row2 (column2 and4?), etc.\n\nApplying that to the test input: the vertical lines (2 and4) are in rows1-5. The 8s structure is in rows9-13. So each of these rows (1-5) would combine 2 (column5) and 4 (column11) with 8s from rows9-13.\n\nBut rows1-5 in the input are the vertical lines, but the 8s are in lower rows. So maybe the output rows are combining the vertical elements from rows1-5 with the 8s from the lower rows, shifted in some way.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by taking the vertical elements (2 and4) from a certain row and the 8s from a corresponding row in the lower part. For example, row1 of the output combines vertical elements from row1 (input) and 8s from row9 (input). But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows after the first and before the last are structured as follows: left element (2), followed by elements from the 8s structure in the lower part, then right element (4). The 8s are arranged in a cross or pattern, so each row of the 8s contributes to a row in the output.\n\nIn the test input's lower 8s:\n\nRow9: [0, 0, 8,8,0,8,8, ...]\n\nRow10: [0,0,8,0,8,8, ...]\n\nRow11: [0,0,0,8,8,8,8, ...]\n\nRow12: [0,0,0,0,8,0, ...]\n\nRow13: [0,0,8,8,0,8,8, ...]\n\nThese 8s form a sort of wavy pattern. The output's middle rows would need to extract these 8s in some way. Perhaps each output row corresponds to a row from the lower 8s structure, combined with the vertical 2 and4 from the upper part.\n\nFor example, if the output has 5 rows after the first and before the last (like example0 has 4 middle rows), but the test input's vertical lines are in rows1-5 (5 rows), so the output would have 5 middle rows. Each would take 2 from column5, 4 from column11, and the 8s from rows9-13.\n\nBut how to align them. Maybe the middle rows are built by taking the vertical elements (2 and4) from rows1-5, and the 8s from rows9-13. For example, output row1 combines row1's 2 and4 with row9's 8s. Row2 combines row2's 2 and4 with row10's 8s, etc.\n\nBut the rows don't line up in numbers (rows1-5 vs rows9-13). So maybe there's a different alignment. Or perhaps the 8s structure is processed to form the middle elements, independent of the row numbers.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are arranged in a cross shape, and each output row's middle elements are the 8s from different positions in the cross.\n\nAnother angle: the output's middle rows have the same number of elements as the horizontal line's length plus two (left and right vertical elements). For example, in example0, the horizontal line (4s) has 4 elements, so the output rows have 6 elements (4+2). But the test input's horizontal line has 5 elements (1s), so the output rows would have 7 elements. However, looking at the examples:\n\n- Example0: first output row has 6 elements (4+2)\n- Example1: first output row has 5 elements (3+2)\n- Example2: first output row has 6 elements (4+2)\n\nBut the test input's first horizontal line is 5 elements. So if the pattern is to add zeros on both ends, the first output row would be [0,1,1,1,1,1,0], which is 7 elements. However, in the training examples, the output rows vary in length. For example, example1's output rows are 5 elements each. But the test input's vertical lines (2 and4) are in columns5 and11. The horizontal lines (1s and 3s) are in columns6-10. The 8s are in columns2,3,5,6, etc. So combining these:\n\nIf the output rows are structured as left vertical element (2 from column5), followed by elements from the horizontal structures (like 8s) in the middle, then right vertical element (4 from column11). The number of middle elements would depend on the horizontal structure's width.\n\nIn the test input's 8s structures, let's look at row9: columns2,3,5,6 have 8s. Row10: columns2,4,5 have 8s. Row11: columns3,4,5,6 have 8s. Row12: column4 has an 8. Row13: columns2,3,5,6 have 8s. \n\nSo the middle elements for each output row would be the 8s from these rows. For example, output row1 (after the first) could be 2 (from column5), then 8,8,0,8,8 (from row9's columns2,3,5,6), then 4. But the columns for the 8s are varying, so how to arrange them.\n\nAlternatively, the middle elements are taken from the columns that have 8s in the lower part, but centered. For example, the 8s in row9 are columns2,3,5,6. So between columns2-6, but with a gap at 4. Maybe the output's middle elements are columns2,3,4,5,6, but with 0s where there are no 8s. So for row9: 8,8,0,8,8. Then the full row would be 2 (from column5, row1), followed by 8,8,0,8,8, then 4 (column11, row1), resulting in [2,8,8,0,8,8,4]. But that's seven elements. Then the first row would be [0,1,1,1,1,1,0], and the last row [0,3,3,3,3,3,0]. But the examples don't have varying row lengths. Wait, in the training examples, each output row has the same length. So this approach might not be correct.\n\nLet's re-examine the examples. All output rows in a given example have the same number of elements. For example0's output is 6 elements per row. Example1's is 5 elements per row. Example2's is 6 elements per row. So the output's row length is consistent within each example. Therefore, the test input's output should have rows of the same length.\n\nBut the horizontal line in the test input's row0 is 5 elements (columns6-10), so the first output row would be [0,1,1,1,1,1,0] (7 elements). Then, how would the other rows be structured to also have 7 elements? Or maybe the test input's output has rows of 6 elements, like example0 and example2. How?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line's length is adjusted to fit. For example, in example0's first input row with 4 elements (4s), the output row is 6 elements. So perhaps the horizontal line is centered with padding. If the test input's 1s are 5 elements, the output row would be 0, then the 5 1s, then 0, totaling 7 elements. But then the other rows would need to match this length.\n\nBut how? Let's think of the test input's output rows. The vertical lines are in columns5 and11 (2 and4), and the 8s are in columns2,3,5,6, etc. So the middle elements between columns5 and11 are columns5 to11, but that's 7 columns. So perhaps each output row is:\n\n[2, elements from columns5 to11 (7 columns), 4], but that would be 9 elements. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are left vertical element (2), followed by certain middle elements, then right vertical element (4). The middle elements could be the 8s from the lower rows, but arranged to fit a certain width.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are constructed by taking the left vertical element (2 from column5), then the middle elements from the lower 8s structure in columns around the vertical lines, then the right vertical element (4 from column11). For example, between columns5 and11, there are columns5 to11 (7 columns), but maybe the middle elements are columns6-10 (the same as the horizontal lines). But in example0, the middle elements include 8s from columns1 and4, which are outside the vertical lines.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the numbers in the output rows, sometimes there's a combination of different numbers. For example, in Example1's output row2: [6,6,8,4,4]. The 8 comes from the input's upper 8s. So perhaps the middle element is the highest non-zero number in that area.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are created by overlaying different layers from the input. The vertical lines form the left and right edges, the horizontal lines form the top and bottom, and the middle is filled with other structures.\n\nAnother possible approach: Each output row is a combination of the vertical elements (left and right) from one row and the horizontal elements from another row. For example, in example0's output row1: 2 and1 from row8, and the 8s from row1. Then row2: 2 and1 from row9, and 8s from row2, etc. This way, each output row combines vertical elements from one row and horizontal elements from another.\n\nIn the test input, the vertical elements (2 and4) are in rows1-5. The horizontal elements (8s) are in rows9-13. So output rows could be:\n\nRow0: [0,1,1,1,1,1,0] (from row0's 1s)\n\nRow1: [2,8,8,0,8,8,4] (vertical from row1, 8s from row9)\n\nRow2: [2,8,0,8,8,0,4] (vertical from row2, 8s from row10)\n\nRow3: [2,0,8,8,8,8,4] (vertical from row3, 8s from row11)\n\nRow4: [2,0,0,8,0,0,4] (vertical from row4, 8s from row12)\n\nRow5: [2,8,8,0,8,8,4] (vertical from row5, 8s from row13)\n\nRow6: [0,3,3,3,3,3,0] (from row6's 3s)\n\nBut this results in 7 elements per row, but the examples have varying lengths. However, the test input's output may need to have the same row length. Let's check the training examples again.\n\nExample0's output has 6 rows. The first row is 0 followed by four 4s and 0. The next four rows combine 2, 8s, and 1, and the last row is 0 followed by four 3s and 0. The middle rows have varying numbers of 8s and zeros, perhaps corresponding to different rows of the diamond.\n\nIn the test input's case, the 8s in rows9-13 form a pattern. For example, row9: 8,8,0,8,8; row10:8,0,8,8; row11:0,8,8,8,8; row12:0,0,8,0,0; row13:8,8,0,8,8. So each of these could be the middle elements. Then, each output row after the first would be:\n\nRow1: 2 (from row1) followed by row9's 8s (columns2,3,5,6), then 4 (from row1). But how to map the columns. Maybe the 8s are taken from the columns where they appear, but arranged between 2 and4. For example, row9's 8s are columns2,3,5,6. Between columns5 and11 (vertical lines), but this might not directly align. \n\nAlternatively, the middle elements are the 8s from the lower rows, regardless of their position, but centered between the vertical lines. For example, the test input's vertical lines are columns5 and11. The distance between them is 6 columns (5 to11 inclusive). The middle elements would be columns6-10, which is 5 elements. So each output row would be:\n\n[left vertical (2), middle 5 elements (from 8s structure), right vertical (4)]\n\nBut the middle 5 elements would need to be taken from the 8s in the lower rows. For example, in row9 of the input, the 8s are in columns2,3,5,6. But between columns5 and11, columns5-11 are 7 columns. So perhaps the middle elements are columns5-11's 8s, but the output row would be [2, 0,8,8,0,8,8,4]. But that's 8 elements. Not matching the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are built as follows: left vertical element (2), followed by the elements from the 8s structure in the lower part, but only the non-zero elements, then the right vertical element (4). But how to determine the order.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of another pattern. Notice that in the training examples, the output rows often have the same numbers in certain positions. For example, in example0's output:\n\nRow1: 2,8,0,0,8,1\n\nRow2: 2,0,8,0,1,1\n\nRow3: 2,2,8,8,1,1\n\nRow4: 2,0,3,0,8,1\n\nThese seem to form a kind of diamond shape with 8s and other numbers. Similarly, the test input's output might form a diamond with 8s.\n\nAnother observation: The output's middle rows form a diamond or hourglass shape. For example, in example0's output, the 8s form a diamond in rows1-4. The same for example2's output. The test input's 8s are arranged in a pattern that might form a diamond when processed.\n\nPutting this together, maybe the output is constructed by:\n\n1. Taking the first horizontal line (like 4s, 3s, 7s) and putting it as the first row, padded with zeros.\n\n2. Taking the last horizontal line (like 3s, 2s, 1s) and putting it as the last row, padded with zeros.\n\n3. The middle rows are formed by combining the vertical lines (left and right) with the diamond structure from the upper and lower parts.\n\nFor the test input:\n\n- First horizontal line is 1s \u2192 [0,1,1,1,1,1,0]\n\n- Last horizontal line is 3s \u2192 [0,3,3,3,3,3,0]\n\n- The middle rows combine 2 (left vertical) and4 (right vertical) with the 8s from the lower part arranged in a diamond.\n\nBut how to fit the 8s into a diamond shape. The lower part's 8s in rows9-13:\n\nRow9: 8,8,0,8,8\n\nRow10:8,0,8,8\n\nRow11:0,8,8,8,8\n\nRow12:0,0,8,0,0\n\nRow13:8,8,0,8,8\n\nThis looks like a diamond pattern. So the output's middle rows would be:\n\nRow1: 2,8,8,0,8,8,4\n\nRow2:2,8,0,8,0,8,4\n\nRow3:2,0,8,8,8,0,4\n\nRow4:2,0,0,8,0,0,4\n\nRow5:2,8,8,0,8,8,4\n\nBut this would make each row 7 elements. However, the training examples have rows of 5 or 6 elements. Maybe the test input's output rows are shorter, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are structured as follows:\n\nLeft element (2), followed by the 8s from the diamond rows, then right element (4). The diamond rows are centered, so perhaps each output row takes a section of the diamond. For example, the diamond in the lower part is:\n\nRow9: 8,8,0,8,8 \u2192 maybe becomes 8,8,0,8,8\n\nRow10:8,0,8,8 \u2192 maybe centered as 0,8,0,8,8,0\n\nRow11:0,8,8,8,8 \u2192 becomes 0,0,8,8,8,8,0\n\nWait, perhaps not. This is getting too vague. \n\nLet's look back at example0's input and output:\n\nInput's diamond is in rows1-4:\n\nRow1:0,8,0,0,8,0...\n\nRow2:0,0,8,0,8,0...\n\nRow3:0,8,8,8,8,0...\n\nRow4:0,0,8,0,8,0...\n\nThe output's middle rows (1-4) are:\n\n[2,8,0,0,8,1]\n\n[2,0,8,0,1,1]\n\n[2,2,8,8,1,1]\n\n[2,0,3,0,8,1]\n\nThe 8s in these rows seem to correspond to the input's rows1-4. For example, row1 of output has 8s in positions 1 and4, which are the same as input row1's 8s in columns1 and4. Output row2 has 8 in position2 (input row2's column2), etc. The diamond's structure is preserved, but the 2 and1 are added from the vertical lines.\n\nSo for the test input's lower 8s, which form a diamond-like structure in rows9-13, the output's middle rows would take the 8s from each of these rows and combine them with the vertical 2 and4. For example:\n\nRow9 of input has 8s in columns2,3,5,6. So output row1 would be 2 (from column5, row1) followed by 8,8,0,8,8 (from columns2,3,5,6, but how?), then 4 (from column11, row1). But the columns between 5 and11 are 6,7,8,9,10. Wait, maybe the output's middle elements are the 8s from the lower part's columns centered between the vertical lines.\n\nAlternatively, the middle elements are taken from the columns where the 8s appear in the lower rows, but relative to the vertical lines. For example, in row9 of the test input, the 8s are in columns2,3,5,6. But the vertical lines are in columns5 and11. The middle elements would be the 8s between these columns. But columns5 and6 are part of the vertical line's column (5 is where the 2s are). This complicates things.\n\nAnother possible approach: Each output row after the first combines the vertical elements (2 and4) with the 8s from the lower part. The 8s are arranged in a pattern that's compressed into the middle of the output row.\n\nFor example, in the test input's row9, the 8s are columns2,3,5,6. If we take these and place them in the middle of the output row, between 2 and4:\n\nOutput row1: 2,8,8,0,8,8,4 \u2192 but this is 7 elements. The examples have varying lengths, but perhaps the test output's rows are longer.\n\nAlternatively, the middle elements are trimmed to fit a certain length. For example, in example0's output, the middle elements are 4 elements (8s and zeros) between 2 and1. For the test input, maybe each middle row has 5 elements between 2 and4. So for row9's 8s, the middle elements would be columns2-6: 8,8,0,8,8. So output row1: 2,8,8,0,8,8,4 (7 elements). But example0's output rows are 6 elements. This doesn't match.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I'm spending, maybe I should try to see if there's a different pattern. Perhaps the output is a combination of the maximum values from each column in certain rows. For example, in example0's output row1, the 2 and1 are the max in their columns (from vertical lines), and the 8s are max from upper rows.\n\nBut that's speculative. Another idea: the output rows are formed by vertically stacking the horizontal layers and horizontally stacking the vertical layers. For example, the horizontal layers (4s, 8s diamond, 3s) are stacked vertically, and the vertical layers (2s and1s) are added to the left and right.\n\nIn example0's output:\n\n- First row: 4s layer.\n\n- Then rows combining 2s and1s with 8s.\n\n- Last row:3s layer.\n\nThe middle rows combine the vertical elements (2 and1) with the diamond's rows.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\n- First row: 1s layer.\n\n- Middle rows: combine 2s and4s with the 8s diamond from lower rows.\n\n- Last row:3s layer.\n\nThe middle rows would have:\n\nRow1: 2 from column5, 8s from row9's columns2,3,5,6, and4 from column11.\n\nBut how to arrange the 8s between 2 and4. Maybe each output row's middle elements are the 8s from a certain row in the lower part, placed in the center.\n\nAlternatively, each output row's middle elements are the 8s from the lower part, centered and trimmed to fit. For example, row9's 8s are columns2,3,5,6. Centered between 2 and6 would be columns2-6 (5 columns). So the middle elements would be 8,8,0,8,8. Then the output row would be [2,8,8,0,8,8,4], totaling 7 elements. But example0's output rows are 6 elements. Maybe the test input's output has 7 elements per row, but the examples vary.\n\nBut the examples have varying row lengths. For instance, example0 has 6, example1 has5, example2 has6. So perhaps the test input's output row length is determined by the horizontal line's length plus two. Since the first horizontal line is 5 elements (1s), output rows would be 7 elements. However, the other examples' first rows have 4 elements (example0), 3 elements (example1), etc., leading to 6,5 elements. This suggests that the pattern is not directly about the horizontal line's length plus two.\n\nAnother observation: In example0, the output rows between the first and last have 6 elements. The vertical elements are 2 and1 (left and right), and the middle four elements are from the diamond's rows. Similarly, example2's output has 6 elements per row, combining vertical elements (4 and6) with the 8s and 1s.\n\nSo perhaps the test input's output will have 6 elements per row. The first and last rows would be [0,1,1,1,1,1,0] (7 elements) and [0,3,3,3,3,3,0], but since this contradicts the examples, maybe the test input's horizontal lines are adjusted. Alternatively, the horizontal lines are padded or truncated to fit a certain length.\n\nAlternatively, the output's row length is determined by the maximum number of elements needed to represent the combined vertical and horizontal structures. For example, in example0, the vertical lines are at columns6 and11, so the distance is 5 columns (6 to11 is 6 columns?), but the output rows have 6 elements, which might be the left (column6), then four elements between, then right (column11). But this isn't clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn each example, the output starts with the first horizontal line (padded with zeros), ends with the last horizontal line (padded), and the middle rows combine the vertical elements with the upper/lower structures.\n\nFor the test input:\n\n- First output row: [0,1,1,1,1,1,0] (but maybe truncated to 6 elements \u2192 [0,1,1,1,1,0])\n\nBut example0's first row is [0,4,4,4,4,0], which is 6 elements for four 4s. The test input's first row has five 1s, but example0's output added two zeros. So perhaps the test input's first row is [0,1,1,1,1,1,0] (7 elements), but this contradicts the examples. Alternatively, the horizontal line is centered and padded to an even length. For five 1s, it's odd, so maybe padded to six elements by adding one zero: [0,1,1,1,1,1,0] \u2192 but 7 elements, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, example0's input horizontal line has four elements (even), padded to six with two zeros. The test input's five elements (odd) would need to be padded to six by adding one zero, but how? Maybe [0,1,1,1,1,0], but that's five elements. This is unclear.\n\nPerhaps the output rows are six elements long, as in example0 and example2. For the test input's first horizontal line (five 1s), the output would be [0,1,1,1,1,1], but this leaves out the trailing zero. Alternatively, centered with even padding: [1,1,1,1,1] \u2192 pad with one zero on each side \u2192 [0,1,1,1,1,1,0], but that's seven elements. \n\nAlternatively, the test input's output rows are six elements, taking the first five elements of the horizontal line and adding a zero. But this is a guess.\n\nAssuming the test input's output has six elements per row:\n\n- First row: [0,1,1,1,1,0]\n\n- Middle rows: combine 2 (column5), 8s from lower rows, and4 (column11). For example:\n\nRow1: [2,8,8,0,8,4]\n\nRow2: [2,8,0,8,8,4]\n\nRow3: [2,0,8,8,8,4]\n\nRow4: [2,0,0,8,0,4]\n\nRow5: [2,8,8,0,8,4]\n\n- Last row: [0,3,3,3,3,0]\n\nBut this is speculative. Alternatively, the middle rows might have 2 and4 as first and last elements, with the middle elements taken from the 8s in the lower rows. For example, row9's 8s in columns2,3,5,6 could be mapped to positions 2,3,5,6 in a 6-element row, with zeros elsewhere:\n\nRow1: [2,8,8,0,8,4]\n\nRow2: [2,8,0,8,8,4]\n\nRow3: [2,0,8,8,8,4]\n\nRow4: [2,0,0,8,0,4]\n\nRow5: [2,8,8,0,8,4]\n\nThis would fit six elements per row. The last row would be [0,3,3,3,3,0].\n\nThis matches the pattern in example0, where the middle rows combine vertical elements with the 8s structure. The test input's 8s in lower rows would thus form the middle elements between 2 and4.\n\nTherefore, the final output for the test input would be:\n\n[0,1,1,1,1,0]\n\n[2,8,8,0,8,4]\n\n[2,8,0,8,8,4]\n\n[2,0,8,8,8,4]\n\n[2,0,0,8,0,4]\n\n[2,8,8,0,8,4]\n\n[0,3,3,3,3,0]\n\nBut example0 has six output rows. The test input's output would have seven rows if we include all middle rows. However, example0's input has vertical lines in four rows (8-11), leading to four middle rows. The test input's vertical lines are in five rows (1-5), so five middle rows. So the total output would be first row, five middle rows, last row \u2192 seven rows. But example0 has six rows (first, four middle, last). So the test input's output would have seven rows, but examples vary.\n\nHowever, the training examples have varying numbers of output rows. Example0 has 6, example1 has5, example2 has6. So the test input's output might have six rows. Perhaps the middle rows are condensed. For example, the test input's vertical lines are in rows1-5 (five rows), but the output takes only four middle rows, combining some of them.\n\nAlternatively, the number of output rows is determined by the height of the 8s structure. For example, the test input's 8s are in five rows (9-13), so the output would have five middle rows. Plus first and last rows \u2192 seven rows. But examples have fewer.\n\nGiven that the test input's 8s are in rows9-13 (five rows), and the vertical lines are in rows1-5 (five rows), maybe each vertical line row corresponds to an 8s row. So the output has five middle rows. Therefore, the total output would be seven rows. But the examples don't have seven rows. Example0's output has six rows: first, four middle, last. Example1's output has five rows: first, three middle, last. So the number of middle rows varies.\n\nPerhaps the number of output rows is the number of rows in the 8s structure plus two (for the first and last rows). In the test input's case, the 8s structure is five rows (9-13), so output would have 5+2=7 rows.\n\nBut example0's 8s structure is four rows (1-4), and the output has six rows (4+2). This fits. Example1's 8s structure is three rows (rows2-4?), and the output has five rows (3+2). So the test input's output would have 5+2=7 rows.\n\nTherefore, the output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,1,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nRow1: [2,8,8,0,8,8,4]\n\nRow2: [2,8,0,8,8,0,4]\n\nRow3: [2,0,8,8,8,8,4]\n\nRow4: [2,0,0,8,0,0,4]\n\nRow5: [2,8,8,0,8,8,4]\n\nRow6: [0,3,3,3,3,3,0]\n\nBut how to make the rows have the same length as in the examples. Since each example's rows have the same length, this output would have seven elements per row, but the examples have 5 or 6. This inconsistency makes me think my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, the test input's output is structured similarly to example2. In example2's output, the first row is [0,7,7,7,7,0], then rows combining 4,6 vertical lines and 8s, then [0,1,1,1,1,0]. The middle rows have 6 elements.\n\nPerhaps the test input's output has six elements per row. The vertical elements are 2 and4, and the middle elements are the 8s from the lower part, arranged in four columns. For example:\n\nRow0: [0,1,1,1,1,0]\n\nRow1: [2,8,8,8,8,4]\n\nRow2: [2,8,0,0,8,4]\n\nRow3: [2,0,8,8,0,4]\n\nRow4: [2,8,8,8,8,4]\n\nRow5: [0,3,3,3,3,0]\n\nThis is six rows with six elements each, matching example0 and example2's structure. But I'm not sure if this aligns with the input's 8s pattern.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the complexity, I'll proceed with an answer that fits the pattern observed in the training examples, even if I'm not entirely confident.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input grids and output grids. The task is to see how the input is transformed into the output. Let me look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 16x15 grid, but the output is a 6x6 grid. Hmm, so the output is smaller. Maybe they're combining rows or columns? Let's look at the input rows. The first few rows in the input are all zeros except for some 8s forming a pattern. Then there's a section with 4s and 2s and 1s. The output starts with [0,4,4,4,4,0], which might correspond to the 4s in row 7 of the input. Then the next rows have 8s and numbers like 2 and 1. Wait, in the input, rows 8-11 have 2s and 1s on the edges. The output rows 2 and 3 have 8s and 2,1. Maybe each output row is combining elements from two input rows? Or perhaps taking non-zero elements from certain parts of the input.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has a 3, 6, 4, 2 pattern. The output starts with [0,3,3,3,0], which could be from the row with 3s. Then the next rows have 6 and 4, which are the numbers from the input's vertical lines. The output seems to capture the outer numbers first, then the inner ones. For instance, the output row [6,0,3,0,4] might be combining the 6 from the left, 3 from the middle, and 4 on the right. Then the next row combines 6 and 4 again with 8 (from the input's 8s in the upper part). So maybe the output is merging vertical and horizontal patterns, taking the maximum or summing in some way?\n\nExample 2's input has 7s, 4s, 6s, 1s, and 8s. The output starts with [0,7,7,7,7,0], which lines up with the 7s in row 1 of the input. Then the next rows have 4 and 6, which are the vertical lines in the input. Also, there's 8 in the output which comes from the lower part of the input where 8s are arranged in a cross-like shape. So maybe the output is combining the top and bottom structures. For example, the 7s and 1s form the top and bottom of the output, and the vertical lines (like 4 and 6) are merged with the 8s from the lower part.\n\nLooking at the test input now. The test input has 1s in the first row, then 2s and 4s in vertical lines, followed by 3s. Then there's a section with 8s arranged in a cross or diamond shape. The output should probably capture the outer layers (like the 1s and 3s) and merge the vertical 2s and 4s with the 8s from below.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern seems to involve taking the outermost non-zero numbers (like the 4s in example 0, 3s in example1, 7s and 1s in example2) and then merging the vertical lines (like the 2s and 4s) with the patterns from the lower part (8s). The output rows might be combining elements from different regions of the input, possibly the maximum value in overlapping areas or concatenating certain sections.\n\nFor the test input, the top has 1s (row 0) and the bottom has 3s (row6). Then there are vertical lines of 2s and 4s. The lower part has 8s arranged in a cross. So the output's first row might be the 1s from the top, then rows combining 2s and 4s with 8s. Let me try to map this.\n\nFirst output row: [0,1,1,1,1,1,0] but maybe trimmed. Wait in the examples, the first and last rows of output are the outermost non-zero elements. For example, in example0, the first output row is the 4s from the middle of the input. Wait, maybe the output captures the middle horizontal layers. Alternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by taking the first non-zero horizontal line (like the 4s in example0's row7) and then the vertical elements. Or maybe each output row is a combination of a horizontal band and vertical elements.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs' structure, the outputs have a certain symmetry. For instance, in example0's output, the first and last rows are the 4s and 3s. The middle rows combine 8s with 2s and 1s. The 8s in the input's upper part are combined with the vertical 2s and 1s from lower rows. So maybe the output is merging the upper and lower parts of the input.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is divided into two parts: upper and lower. The output combines the upper part's horizontal lines and the lower part's vertical lines. For example, in example0, the upper part has the 8s forming a cross, and the lower part has vertical lines (2s and 1s). The output seems to have the horizontal 4s (from the middle of the input) as the first and last rows, and in between, each row combines the upper 8s with the lower 2 and 1. But how exactly?\n\nLooking at the output rows for example0:\n\nRow0: [0,4,4,4,4,0] \u2013 corresponds to input row7 which is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,...]\n\nRow1: [2,8,0,0,8,1] \u2013 2 and 1 are from the vertical lines (input rows8-11, columns6 and 11). The 8s are from input rows1-4, columns1 and 4.\n\nSo maybe each output row after the first combines elements from the vertical lines (2 and 1) and the upper structure (8s). Similarly, in example1, the output rows combine the vertical 6 and 4 with the upper 8s and 3s.\n\nIn the test input, the vertical lines are 2s and 4s (columns5 and 11). The upper part has 1s and 3s as horizontal lines, and the lower part has 8s arranged in a cross. So perhaps the output will have the horizontal 1s and 3s as first and last rows, and in between, combine the vertical 2 and 4 with the 8s.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nFirst output row: [0,1,1,1,1,1,0] but the examples have 6 elements. Wait, example0's input rows are 16 elements, output rows 6 elements. So perhaps the output is a transformation where the first and last rows are the non-zero horizontal lines (like 1s and 3s here), and the middle rows combine the vertical lines (2 and 4) with the 8s from the lower part.\n\nIn the test input, the first row has 1s from index6 to 10. So the output first row might be [0,1,1,1,1,1,0], but the examples have the first row as the middle horizontal line. Wait, in example0, the first output row is the 4s from row7 of the input, which is in the middle. Similarly, example2's first output row is the 7s from row1. So maybe the first and last output rows correspond to the upper and lower horizontal lines in the input. Wait, example0's input has 4s in row7 (middle) and 3s in row12 (lower middle). The output starts with 4s and ends with 3s. So maybe the output's first row is the middle horizontal non-zero line (like 4s in example0), and the last row is another horizontal line (3s in example0).\n\nIn the test input, the first non-zero horizontal line is the 1s in row0, but the output examples don't start with the very first row. Wait, example0's first output row is row7 of the input. So perhaps the output's first and last rows are horizontal lines from the middle part of the input. Let me check:\n\nIn example0's input:\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,...] \u2192 output row0: [0,4,4,4,4,0]\n\nRow12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,...] \u2192 output row5: [0,3,3,3,3,0]\n\nSo the first and last output rows are the horizontal lines from the middle of the input (rows7 and 12). The middle output rows (rows1-4) are combining the vertical lines (2 and 1) with the upper 8s.\n\nIn example1, the first output row is [0,3,3,3,0], which comes from row6 of the input: [0,0,3,3,3,0...]. The last output row is [0,2,2,2,0], from row10: [0,0,2,2,2,0...]. The middle rows combine vertical lines (6 and4) with the upper 8s.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n1. Identify horizontal lines (sequences of same non-zero numbers) in the middle section of the input. The first and last output rows are these horizontal lines, trimmed to their non-zero parts and surrounded by zeros.\n\n2. For the middle output rows, combine elements from vertical lines (non-zero numbers in columns) and the upper part (like the 8s in example0 and example1). How exactly?\n\nLooking at example0's output row1: [2,8,0,0,8,1]. The 2 and 1 are from the vertical lines (columns6 and 11 in input rows8-11). The 8s are from columns1 and4 in input rows1-4.\n\nSo each middle output row is taking the vertical elements (2 and1) and the upper elements (8s) and combining them. Maybe each output row corresponds to a pair of input rows, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows might be formed by taking the vertical numbers (like 2 and1) and the numbers from the upper structure (like 8s) and placing them in the same row. For example, the 2 comes from the left vertical line (column5 in example1's input?), and the 1 from the right vertical line. Then the 8s from the upper structure are placed in between.\n\nIn the test input, the vertical lines are 2s in column5 and 4s in column11. The upper structure has the 1s in row0 and the 3s in row6. The lower part has 8s arranged in a cross pattern in rows9-13.\n\nSo the output's first row would be the 1s from row0, but in the examples, the first output row was from the middle. Wait, no. In example0, the first output row is from the middle of the input. Similarly, example1's first output row is from row6, which is the middle. So maybe the first and last output rows are the horizontal lines from the middle of the input, not the very top or bottom.\n\nIn the test input, the horizontal lines are 1s (row0) and 3s (row6). But maybe the relevant horizontal lines are in the lower part. Wait, the lower part of the test input has 8s arranged in rows 9-13. For example, row9 is [0,0,8,8,0,8,8,0,...], row10 [0,0,8,0,8,8,0,0,...], etc. But these form a cross or diamond shape. So maybe the horizontal lines for the output are from the middle of the input. Let's see:\n\nLooking at example0, the output's first row is from input row7 (4s), which is in the middle. Example1's first output row is from input row6 (3s), also middle. Example2's first output row is from input row1 (7s), which is near the top, but the last output row is input row6 (1s). So maybe the first and last output rows are the first and last horizontal lines encountered in the input, but not necessarily in the very top or bottom.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is the first horizontal non-zero line encountered when scanning the input from top to bottom, and the last output row is the last horizontal non-zero line. Then the middle rows are combinations of vertical lines and upper/lower structures.\n\nBut in the test input, the first horizontal line is the 1s in row0. The next horizontal line is the 3s in row6. Then the 8s in rows9-13 form a cross but not a horizontal line. So the output's first row might be the 1s and the last row the 3s, but in the examples, the outputs start and end with the middle horizontal lines. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first horizontal line (like the 1s in test input row0), the last horizontal line (3s in row6), and between them, combining vertical elements (2 and4) with the 8s from the lower part.\n\nWait, in example0, the output rows between first and last have elements from vertical lines (2 and1) and upper 8s. So for the test input, the middle rows of the output would combine the 2s and4s (vertical lines) with the 8s from the lower part. The first and last rows would be the horizontal lines (1s and3s).\n\nBut in example0, the first and last rows are 4s and3s, which are both in the middle of the input. So maybe the first and last output rows are horizontal lines that are between the vertical lines and the upper/lower structures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is built by taking the vertical lines (like columns with 2 and4) and intersecting them with the horizontal structures (like the 8s cross and the 1s and3s lines).\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's think of the outputs in the examples. For example0:\n\nThe output rows are:\n\n[0,4,4,4,4,0]\n\n[2,8,0,0,8,1]\n\n[2,0,8,0,1,1]\n\n[2,2,8,8,1,1]\n\n[2,0,3,0,8,1]\n\n[0,3,3,3,3,0]\n\nThe first and last rows correspond to horizontal lines of 4s and3s. The middle rows have 2 and1 at the edges and 8s and3s in the middle. The 2 and1 are from vertical lines. The 8s are from the cross in the upper part of the input. So each middle row of the output is combining the vertical elements (2 and1) with the horizontal elements (8s) from the cross. The positions of the 8s in the output's middle rows correspond to where they are in the cross. For example, in the second output row, the 8s are at positions1 and4, which matches the cross's positions in the input.\n\nIn the test input, the vertical lines are 2s in column5 and4s in column11. The cross of 8s is in the lower part. The horizontal lines are 1s in row0 and3s in row6.\n\nFollowing the pattern from example0, the first output row would be the horizontal line of 1s, but in example0 the first row is the middle 4s. Wait, no. Maybe the first and last output rows are horizontal lines that are between the vertical lines and the cross structures. For example, in test input, maybe the 1s and3s are the first and last output rows. Then the middle rows would combine the vertical 2 and4 with the 8s cross.\n\nSo the output might look like:\n\n[0,1,1,1,1,1,0] (trimmed to 6 elements?) Wait, but the examples have the same number of elements in each row. Let's check example0's input: the first output row is 6 elements, which is the length of the horizontal line (4 elements of 4s, plus zeros on either end). Similarly, the test input's first row has 1s from index6 to10 (5 elements). But the examples have the first row with 4 elements of 4s. So perhaps the output is centered, taking the non-zero part and adding zeros on either side to make the row length.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the same length as the number of vertical lines plus the cross elements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are constructed by taking the vertical elements (left and right) and the cross elements in between.\n\nFor the test input, the vertical lines are at columns5 (2s) and 11 (4s). The cross of 8s is in the lower part. So the middle rows would have 2 on the left, 4 on the right, and 8s in the middle where the cross is. The first row would be the 1s (row0) and the last row the 3s (row6). Let's see:\n\nFirst output row: [0,1,1,1,1,1,0] \u2192 but example0's first row has 4 non-zero elements. Maybe trimmed to 6 elements. So the test input's 1s are 5 elements, maybe padded to 6? But in example0, the first row is 4 non-zero with zeros on both ends. Maybe the test output's first row would be [0,1,1,1,1,1,0], but to match the example's 6 elements, perhaps it's [0,1,1,1,1,0]. Wait, but the test input's 1s are from index6 to10 (positions 6-10 inclusive, which is 5 elements). So maybe the first output row is [0,1,1,1,1,1,0] but cut to 6 elements. Alternatively, maybe the output rows have the same length as the number of columns in the vertical lines and cross elements.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example0's output, the first row has 6 elements. The input's horizontal line (4s) spans from column7 to10 (4 elements), so the output first row is [0,4,4,4,4,0], which is 6 elements. So for the test input's 1s, which are from column6 to10 (5 elements), the output first row would be [0,1,1,1,1,1,0], but this is 7 elements. Hmm, maybe the output is constructed by centering the non-zero elements and padding with zeros to match the required length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's rows are formed by taking the non-zero horizontal line and surrounding it with zeros, then trimming to the required length. For example0's first row: input row7's 4s are at positions7-10 (4 elements), so output is [0,4,4,4,4,0] (6 elements). For the test input's 1s in row0, columns6-10 (5 elements), the output first row would be [0,1,1,1,1,1,0], which is 7 elements. But the examples have 6 elements. This doesn't fit. So maybe the horizontal lines are those that are exactly four elements long, and thus padded to 6. But in example2's first output row is [0,7,7,7,7,0], which is six elements, matching the input's row1 where the 7s are four elements. So the pattern is that the horizontal line must be four elements, and padded with zeros. But the test input's 1s are five elements long. Hmm, conflicting. Maybe the horizontal lines are not exactly four elements, but any length, and the output row is formed by taking the non-zero elements, adding a zero at each end, and trimming to fit. For example, the test input's 1s are five elements, so output row would be [0,1,1,1,1,1,0], but trimmed to 6 elements. How? Maybe [0,1,1,1,1,0] by cutting off the last 1 and the trailing zero. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by combining the left vertical line, the cross elements, and the right vertical line. For example, in example0, the left vertical line is 2s (column6) and right is 1s (column11). The cross elements are 8s in columns1 and4. So each output row combines these elements. Let's see:\n\nRow1 of output example0: [2,8,0,0,8,1]\n\nSo the first element is the left vertical (2), then the cross's first 8 (column1), zeros in between, the cross's other 8 (column4), then the right vertical (1).\n\nBut in example0's input, the cross is in rows1-4, columns1 and4. So the cross has 8s at (row1, col1), (row2, col2), etc. Maybe the output rows for the cross are taking the positions of the 8s and combining them with the verticals.\n\nAlternatively, each row in the output corresponds to a row in the cross structure of the upper part, merged with the vertical lines from the lower part.\n\nThis is getting quite complicated. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nPossible steps for the transformation:\n\n1. Identify the horizontal lines in the input (rows with consecutive same non-zero numbers). These form the first and last rows of the output.\n\n2. Identify vertical lines (columns with consecutive same non-zero numbers). These provide the left and right elements in the middle output rows.\n\n3. Identify a cross or diamond-shaped structure (like the 8s in example0 and example1, and test input's 8s). These provide the middle elements in the output rows.\n\n4. Combine the vertical line numbers (left and right) with the cross numbers to form the middle output rows.\n\nFor example, in example0:\n\n- Horizontal lines: row7 (4s) and row12 (3s) \u2192 first and last output rows.\n\n- Vertical lines: column6 (2s) and column11 (1s).\n\n- Cross structure: 8s in rows1-4, forming a cross.\n\nThe middle output rows (1-4) combine the vertical numbers (2 and1) with the cross's 8s.\n\nLooking at output row1: [2,8,0,0,8,1]. The 2 is the left vertical (column6), the 1 is the right vertical (column11). The 8s are from the cross in columns1 and4. So positions 1 and4 in the output row are 8s.\n\nSimilarly, in example2's output rows, the middle rows combine vertical lines (4 and6) with cross 8s and 1s.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\n- Horizontal lines: row0 (1s) and row6 (3s). These would be the first and last output rows.\n\n- Vertical lines: column5 (2s) and column11 (4s).\n\n- Cross structure: the 8s in rows9-13. The cross seems to be arranged as follows:\n\nRow9: 8,8,0,8,8\n\nRow10:8,0,8,8,0\n\nRow11:0,8,8,8,8\n\nRow12:0,0,8,0,0\n\nRow13:8,8,0,8,8\n\nThis might form a diamond shape. The cross's elements would be in the middle positions of the output rows.\n\nSo the middle output rows would combine the vertical 2 (left) and 4 (right) with the cross's 8s in between.\n\nFor example, the first middle row after the horizontal 1s would be [2,8,0,0,8,4], then next rows would adjust based on the cross's structure.\n\nBut how exactly? Let's see.\n\nIn example0's cross (8s), the output rows for the cross are arranged such that each row of the cross corresponds to a row in the output. For example, row1 of the output corresponds to the first row of the cross (row1 of input), which has 8s at columns1 and4. So output row1 has 8s at positions1 and4.\n\nSimilarly, in the test input, the cross in rows9-13 would be mapped to the middle output rows. So for each row in the cross, we take the positions of 8s and place them in the output row between the left and right verticals.\n\nAssuming the cross in the test input's lower part has rows:\n\nRow9:8,8,0,8,8 \u2192 positions2,3,5,6 (assuming columns start at 0)\n\nRow10:8,0,8,8,0 \u2192 positions2,4,5\n\nRow11:0,8,8,8,8 \u2192 positions3,4,5,6\n\nRow12:0,0,8,0,0 \u2192 position4\n\nRow13:8,8,0,8,8 \u2192 positions2,3,5,6\n\nSo for each of these cross rows, the 8s are at certain positions. The output rows would have the left vertical (2) at position0, the right vertical (4) at position5, and the 8s in between.\n\nFor example, row9 of the cross would translate to an output row [2,8,8,8,8,4], but maybe with zeros where there are no 8s.\n\nWait, perhaps the output rows are structured as:\n\nLeft vertical (2), followed by the cross's elements, then right vertical (4). But how to arrange the cross's elements into the middle positions.\n\nAlternatively, the cross's elements are placed in the middle of the output row, between the left and right verticals.\n\nFor example, the first middle row (corresponding to row9 of the cross):\n\nThe 8s are at columns2,3,5,6. The output row would have 2 (left) and 4 (right), with the cross elements in between. But how to map the columns.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Maybe the cross's elements are centered and the output rows are formed by taking the left vertical, the cross's elements, and the right vertical. The cross's elements are condensed into the middle part of the output row.\n\nAlternatively, the cross's rows are compressed into a single row in the output, combining the positions of the 8s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output's middle rows are each a combination of the cross's row and the vertical lines, with the 8s placed in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, think of each output row as a combination of the vertical line elements (2 and4) and the cross's elements (8s). For example:\n\nFor each row in the cross structure of the input (rows9-13):\n\nTake the 8s from that row and place them in the middle of the output row, with 2 on the left and4 on the right.\n\nBut how to align them. For example, in row9 of the test input's cross:\n\nColumns2,3,5,6 are 8s. So the output row would have 2, followed by 8s at positions corresponding to these columns, then 4. But since the output row is shorter, maybe the 8s are compressed.\n\nAlternatively, the cross's elements are centered, and the output rows have the left and right verticals with the cross's elements in between.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output row's length is determined by the left and right verticals plus the cross's width.\n\nIn example0, the output rows have 6 elements. Left vertical (2), then cross elements (8s at positions1 and4), then right vertical (1). So the output row is [2,8,0,0,8,1].\n\nSimilarly, for the test input's cross rows:\n\nRow9 has 8s at columns2,3,5,6. So perhaps the output row would be [2,8,8,0,8,4]. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the example0's output rows:\n\nRow0: [0,4,4,4,4,0] \u2192 from horizontal line in input row7.\n\nRow1: [2,8,0,0,8,1] \u2192 left vertical (2), cross 8s (positions1 and4), right vertical (1).\n\nRow2: [2,0,8,0,1,1] \u2192 cross 8s at position2.\n\nRow3: [2,2,8,8,1,1] \u2192 cross 8s at positions2 and3.\n\nRow4: [2,0,3,0,8,1] \u2192 combines 3s (from input row12) and 8s.\n\nRow5: [0,3,3,3,3,0] \u2192 horizontal line from input row12.\n\nSo the middle rows are combining left and right verticals with cross elements, and possibly other horizontal lines.\n\nBut the pattern here seems that the cross elements in the input's upper part are being combined with the vertical lines from the lower part. The cross's rows are being mapped to the middle output rows, with the verticals added on the sides.\n\nIn example0's input, the cross is in rows1-4. Each of these rows contributes to the output rows1-4. For example, input row1 has 8s at columns1 and4 \u2192 output row1 has 8s at positions1 and4. Input row2 has 8s at columns2 \u2192 output row2 has 8 at position2. Input row3 has 8s at columns1-4 \u2192 output row3 has 8s at positions2 and3. Wait, no. Input row3 of example0 is [0,8,8,8,8,0...], so columns1-4 are 8s. Output row3 is [2,2,8,8,1,1]. So the 8s are in positions2 and3, which corresponds to the middle of the input's row3.\n\nHmm, perhaps the cross's elements are centered and condensed into the middle of the output rows. So for each row of the cross in the input, the output row takes the central part of the cross and combines it with the verticals.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are formed by overlaying the cross's rows with the vertical lines.\n\nFor the test input, the cross is in rows9-13. Let's consider each of these rows and how they might be combined with the vertical lines (2 and4).\n\nRow9: [0,0,8,8,0,8,8,0,...] \u2192 columns2,3,5,6 are 8s.\n\nRow10: [0,0,8,0,8,8,0,0,...] \u2192 columns2,4,5 are 8s.\n\nRow11: [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,...] \u2192 columns3,4,5,6 are 8s.\n\nRow12: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,...] \u2192 column4 is 8.\n\nRow13: [0,0,8,8,0,8,8,0,...] \u2192 columns2,3,5,6 are 8s.\n\nSo, the cross's rows have varying positions of 8s. The output rows would combine these with the verticals 2 and4.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow9 of cross \u2192 output row1: [2,8,8,8,8,4] \u2192 but need to check the length. The output rows in examples have 6 elements. So maybe each cross row's 8s are condensed into the middle 4 positions, with the verticals at the ends.\n\nFor row9: 8s at columns2,3,5,6. But in the output row, perhaps these are mapped to positions1-4. So 8s at positions1,2,4,5. But example0's output row1 has 8s at positions1 and4.\n\nAlternatively, the cross's elements are taken as the central part, and the verticals are added on the ends. For example, if the cross row has 8s in certain positions, the output row would have those 8s in the middle, with the verticals (2 and4) on the ends.\n\nSo for row9 of the test input's cross: the 8s are at columns2,3,5,6. The middle part between the verticals (columns5 and11) is columns5-11. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, the output row is constructed as follows:\n\nLeft vertical (2) \u2192 first element.\n\nThen, the cross elements from the current cross row, arranged in the middle.\n\nRight vertical (4) \u2192 last element.\n\nThe cross elements are arranged between them. For example, if the cross row has 8s in certain positions, those are placed between the left and right verticals.\n\nBut how to determine their positions.\n\nIn example0's output row1: [2,8,0,0,8,1]. The left vertical is 2, then two 8s separated by zeros, then the right vertical 1.\n\nThis corresponds to the cross row1 in example0's input, which has 8s at columns1 and4. So in the output row, the 8s are placed at positions1 and4 (if the output row has positions0-5). So 0:2, 1:8, 4:8, 5:1.\n\nSimilarly, in the test input's cross row9 (8s at columns2,3,5,6), perhaps in the output row, these are mapped to positions1,2,3,4. So the output row would be [2,8,8,8,8,4]. But this is 6 elements.\n\nBut example0's output row1 has two 8s, not four. So maybe the mapping is not direct. Perhaps the cross's elements are centered, and their positions in the output are adjusted accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, each output row corresponds to a row in the cross, and the 8s are placed in the same relative positions. For example, in example0's cross row1 (8s at columns1 and4), the output row has 8s at positions1 and4 (0-based indexing). The output row has length6, so positions0-5.\n\nSo for the test input's cross row9 (8s at columns2,3,5,6), which are positions2,3,5,6 in the input row. How to map to the output's positions. The output row has 6 elements (positions0-5). So the 8s would be at positions1,2,3,4 if we subtract 1 from the input column index. But columns2 and3 would be positions1 and2, columns5 and6 would be positions4 and5. But the output row has 6 positions (0-5). So 8s at positions1,2,4,5. Then the output row would be [2,8,8,0,8,4], but need to see how.\n\nAlternatively, the cross's columns are shifted to fit into the output row. For example, if the cross is centered at a certain column, the output row centers the 8s.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to look for the pattern in the examples and apply it to the test input.\n\nIn the examples:\n\n- The first output row is a horizontal line from the middle of the input, padded with zeros.\n\n- The last output row is another horizontal line from the lower middle.\n\n- The middle rows combine the vertical lines (left and right) with the cross's 8s.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nThe horizontal lines are row0 (1s) and row6 (3s). But in the examples, the first output row is from the middle. Maybe the test input's horizontal lines are row0 and row6, which are the first and last output rows.\n\nSo output row0: [0,1,1,1,1,1,0] \u2192 trimmed to 6 elements: [0,1,1,1,1,0].\n\nRow5: [0,3,3,3,3,0] (since the input's row6 has 3s from columns6-10, which is 5 elements. Trimmed to 4 elements and padded with zeros).\n\nThe middle rows would combine the vertical 2s and4s with the cross's 8s.\n\nLooking at the cross rows (9-13):\n\nRow9:8,8,0,8,8 \u2192 possible middle elements [8,8,8,8] \u2192 output row1: [2,8,8,8,8,4]\n\nRow10:8,0,8,8,0 \u2192 middle elements [8,8,8] \u2192 output row2: [2,0,8,8,8,4]\n\nRow11:0,8,8,8,8 \u2192 middle elements [8,8,8,8] \u2192 output row3: [2,8,8,8,8,4]\n\nRow12:0,0,8,0,0 \u2192 middle element [8] \u2192 output row4: [2,0,0,8,0,4]\n\nRow13:8,8,0,8,8 \u2192 middle elements [8,8,8,8] \u2192 but since we have row5 as the 3s, maybe row4 is [2,0,3,0,8,4], similar to example0's row4.\n\nBut this is just guessing. The key is to see how the verticals and cross elements are combined.\n\nAlternatively, the middle rows are constructed by taking the left vertical (2), then the cross elements from each row of the cross, and the right vertical (4). So:\n\nFor cross row9 (columns2-6):\n\nThe 8s are at columns2,3,5,6. The output row would have 2 at start, then 8s at positions corresponding to columns2-6 minus some offset, then 4. Since the output row has 6 elements, the positions would be:\n\n0:2\n\n1: column2 \u2192 8\n\n2: column3 \u21928\n\n3: column5 \u21928\n\n4: column6 \u21928\n\n5:4\n\nBut this would make [2,8,8,8,8,4]. However, example0's first middle row has zeros between the 8s. So perhaps the cross elements are placed in specific positions, not all consecutively.\n\nAlternatively, the cross elements are centered. For example, in example0's cross row1, the 8s are at columns1 and4, which are positions1 and4 in the output row. So for the test input's cross row9, which has 8s at columns2,3,5,6 (assuming 0-based), the output row would have 8s at positions1,2,4,5. So the output row would be [2,8,8,0,8,4]. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are built by taking the left vertical (2), then the cross elements in their original order, trimming or padding as needed, then the right vertical (4). For example:\n\nRow9 of cross has 8,8,0,8,8. So between the verticals: 8,8,0,8,8. Trimming to 4 elements (since the output row needs 6 elements: 2, [4 elements],4). So take the first four elements: 8,8,0,8 \u2192 [2,8,8,0,8,4].\n\nBut example0's row1 is [2,8,0,0,8,1], which has two 8s separated by zeros. So perhaps the cross elements are arranged with spacing. Alternatively, the cross's elements are arranged symmetrically.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll proceed to construct the output for the test input based on the patterns observed.\n\nFirst row: [0,1,1,1,1,1,0] \u2192 but examples have 6 elements. So perhaps trim to [0,1,1,1,1,0].\n\nLast row: [0,3,3,3,3,0].\n\nMiddle rows:\n\nCombining vertical 2 and 4 with cross's 8s.\n\nAssuming the cross's rows are mapped to the middle output rows:\n\nRow9: [2,8,8,8,8,4]\n\nRow10: [2,8,0,8,8,4]\n\nRow11: [2,0,8,8,8,4]\n\nRow12: [2,0,0,8,0,4]\n\nRow13: [2,8,8,0,8,4]\n\nBut need to check the number of rows. The examples have 6 output rows. The test input's output should have as many rows as the horizontal lines (2) plus the cross's rows (5). But example0 has 6 output rows, which is 2 horizontals +4 cross rows. So perhaps the cross's rows are condensed into 4 middle rows. For example, taking rows9,10,11,13 (omitting row12 and13). But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the first and last horizontal lines plus four middle rows combining the cross's main rows.\n\nGiven that example0 has 6 rows (2 horizontal +4 cross), the test input's output should also have 6 rows. The cross in the test input has 5 rows, but maybe the middle four are selected.\n\nAlternatively, the middle rows are the cross's rows, each combined with the verticals.\n\nSo, final guess for the test output:\n\n[0,1,1,1,1,0]\n\n[2,8,8,8,8,4]\n\n[2,8,0,8,8,4]\n\n[2,0,8,8,8,4]\n\n[2,8,8,0,8,4]\n\n[0,3,3,3,3,0]\n\nBut this needs to match the style of the examples. For instance, example0's middle rows have varying combinations. The key is to see if the cross's rows are mirrored or arranged symmetrically.\n\nAlternatively, the middle rows are constructed by taking the cross's rows and placing the 8s between the verticals, with zeros where there are no 8s.\n\nFor example, row9's 8s at columns2,3,5,6 \u2192 in output row1, between 2 and4: 8,8,0,8 \u2192 [2,8,8,0,8,4].\n\nBut example0's row1 is [2,8,0,0,8,1], which has 8s at positions1 and4.\n\nSo perhaps the cross's elements are placed symmetrically in the output row. For the test input's row9, which has 8s at columns2,3,5,6 (symmetric around column4), the output row would have 8s at positions1,2,3,4. But with the verticals at 0 and5.\n\nThis would give [2,8,8,8,8,4].\n\nSimilarly, row10 of the cross has 8s at columns2,4,5. So symmetric placement in output row2: [2,8,0,8,8,4].\n\nRow11 of the cross has 8s at3,4,5,6 \u2192 output row3: [2,0,8,8,8,4].\n\nRow13 of the cross has 8s at2,3,5,6 \u2192 output row4: [2,8,8,0,8,4].\n\nRow12 of the cross has an 8 at4 \u2192 output row4: [2,0,0,8,0,4].\n\nBut example0's output has a row combining 3s from the lower horizontal line. So perhaps the last middle row includes the lower horizontal line's elements.\n\nIn the test input, the lower horizontal line is the 3s in row6. So the last middle row before the final output row might include 3s.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following output:\n\n[0,1,1,1,1,0]\n\n[2,8,8,8,8,4]\n\n[2,8,0,8,8,4]\n\n[2,0,8,8,8,4]\n\n[2,8,8,0,8,4]\n\n[0,3,3,3,3,0]",
