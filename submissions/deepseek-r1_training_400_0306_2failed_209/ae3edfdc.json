        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a 15x15 grid with some numbers, and the output is another grid. The goal is to find how the input transforms into the output.\n\nFirst, let's look at Example 0. The input has a 3 in the first row at position 3 (0-indexed?), then in the fourth row, there's a 3, 2, and another 3. The output shows that around the 2, there are 3s above, below, left, and right. Similarly, in the row with the 7 and 1, the output has 7s around the 1. So maybe numbers like 3 or 7 are being placed around certain numbers (like 2 or 1) in the input.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 2 is in the fourth row (index 4?), and the output has 3s surrounding it. The 1 is in the 10th row (index 10?), and the output has 7s around it. So perhaps the numbers around the 2 and 1 in the input are replaced with the same number as the surrounding cells. Wait, but where do those numbers come from? In the input of Example 0, the 2 is at position (4,3) and in the output, the cells above, below, left, and right of that position are 3s. Looking at the input, there's a 3 in the same row as the 2 (position 8 in row 4). Hmm, maybe the 3s are taken from adjacent cells in the input. Wait, but in the input for Example 0, the 3 in row 0, column 3, and the 3 in row 9, column 3, but how do they relate to the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe when there's a 2 or a 1 in the input, the surrounding cells (up, down, left, right) in the output are set to the value that was adjacent to the 2 or 1 in the input. Or perhaps the 2 and 1 act as \"seeds\" and the surrounding cells are filled with the number that's present in the same row or column but at a distance. Let me check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has a 7 in row 0, column 3. Then in row 2, there's a 1. The output for row 2 has 7s around the 1. So maybe when a 1 is present, the cells adjacent to it in the output are set to the number that's present in the same column but in a different row. For instance, the 1 in Example 1 is in row 2, column 3. The input has a 7 in row 0, column 3 and another 7 in row 8, column 3. So the output places 7s around the 1. Similarly, in the same example, there's a 2 in row 10, column 11. The output has 3s around it. In the input, there's a 3 in row 10, column 5. So maybe the 3 is taken from the same row but earlier in the row? But how?\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the 2 is at (10,11), and the output has 3 to the left (10,10) and 3 below (11,11)? Wait, the output shows in row 10, columns 10 and 12 as 3 and 0, but maybe not. Let me look again. The output for Example 1's 2 is in row 10, column 11. The output rows 10 and 11 have [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0] and [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]. So around the 2 (row 10, col 11), the left cell is 3 (col 10), and the cell below (row 11, col 11) is 3. Where did those 3s come from? In the input, row 10 has a 3 at column 5. But how does that connect to the 2's position?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2 and 1 are centers, and the surrounding cells in the output are filled with numbers that are present in their respective rows or columns in the input. For example, in the case of the 1 in Example 0, there's a 7 in the same column but a few rows above. Wait, the input has a 7 in row 6, column 11. The output for the 1 in row 10, column 11 has 7s around it. Maybe the 7 from row 6 is being moved down to the cells adjacent to the 1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers (like 3, 7) are being \"attracted\" to the 2 and 1 positions. Maybe the 2 and 1 act as magnets, pulling the closest number from their row or column into their adjacent cells in the output.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has a 1 in row 6, column 10. The output has 7s above and below (row 6, column 9 becomes 7, and row 7, column 10 becomes 7). In the input, there's a 7 in row 6, column 1 and another 7 in row 14, column 10. So maybe the 7 from the same column (row 14, column 10) is used to place 7s around the 1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers adjacent to the 1 or 2 in the output are the numbers that are present in the same row or column as the 1/2 in the input, but the closest non-zero number in that row or column. For instance, in Example 0's 2 is in row 4, column 3. Looking at row 4 in the input, there's a 3 at column 0 and column 8. The output places 3s above and below (rows 3 and 5, column 3) and to the left and right (row 4, columns 2 and 4). So perhaps the 3s are taken from the same row. The 3 in row 4, column 0 is to the left of the 2. But in the output, the 3s are placed around the 2. Maybe the 2's adjacent cells in the output take the value of the first non-zero number in the same row or column of the 2 in the input.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 is in row 4. In that row, the numbers are 3, 0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3, etc. So the row has 3s at positions 0 and 8. The output has 3s around the 2. So perhaps the 3s from the same row are used to populate the adjacent cells around the 2.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 0's 1 is in row 10, column 11. The input row 10 has a 7 at column 5 and a 3 at column 11. Wait, no. The input row 10 in Example 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7]. So there's a 7 at column 5 and 14. The output around the 1 (row 10, column 11) has 7s at left (column 10) and right (column 12) in the same row? No, the output row 10 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,7,0,0]. So the 7s are left and right of the 1 in the same row. But in the input row 10, the 7s are at columns 5 and 14. So how does that happen? Maybe the 7s in the same row are the ones that are placed adjacent to the 1 in the output.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the 1 in row 10, column 11 has 7s to the left (column 10) and right (column 12). But in the input row 10, the 7s are at columns 5 and 14. So perhaps the 7s from the same row are the ones closest to the 1? But column 5 is far left. Alternatively, maybe the 7s are from the same column as the 1. Looking at column 11 in the input for Example 0: rows 6 and 14 have 7s. So column 11 has 7s in rows 6 and 14. The output places 7s in row 10, column 11's left and right. Wait, but those are in the same row. So maybe it's taking the value from the same row but the nearest non-zero. But in row 10, the 7 is at column 5 and 14. The 1 is at column 11. The nearest 7 is at column 14 (distance 3 to the right) and column 5 (distance 6 to the left). But the output places 7s in columns 10 and 12. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers around 1 and 2 in the output are the numbers that were in the same row or column as the 1 or 2 in the input. For instance, the 1 in row 10, column 11 of Example 0's input. The same row (row 10) has 7s at columns 5 and 14. The same column (column 11) has 7s in rows 6 and 14. Maybe the output takes the value from the same column. So the 7s in column 11 (rows 6 and 14) would influence the cells around the 1. But in the output, the 7s are in the same row as the 1, left and right. So perhaps the output for the 1's adjacent cells uses the numbers from the same column as the 1 in the input. The input's column 11 has 7s in rows 6 and 14. The output places 7s in the same column (11) but adjacent rows (9 and 11). Wait, in the output for Example 0, the 7s are in row 9, column 11 (no, looking at output for Example 0, the row 9 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0], and row 10 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,7,0,0], and row 11 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]. So the 7s are in rows 9, 10, and 11 of column 11. But the input's column 11 has 7s in rows 6 and 14. So maybe the 7s are being moved to surround the 1. But how?\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to look for another approach.\n\nAnother observation: in the outputs, the 2 and 1 are still present in the same positions. The surrounding cells (up, down, left, right) are filled with numbers that might be derived from other parts of the input. For example, in Example 0, the 2 is at (4,3). The output has 3s at (3,3), (5,3), (4,2), (4,4). The input for row 4 has 3s at columns 0 and 8. So maybe the 3s from row 4 are copied to the adjacent positions of the 2. Similarly, the 1 in row 10, column 11 has 7s around it. The input row 10 has 7s at columns 5 and 14. So maybe the 7s are being used to fill the adjacent cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 2 or 1 in the input acts as a center, and the adjacent cells in the output are filled with the maximum value present in their row or column. For instance, in Example 0's row 4, the maximum value is 3 (since there's a 3 and a 2). So the adjacent cells around the 2 are filled with 3. Similarly, in row 10 of the same example, the maximum value is 7, so the 1's adjacent cells are filled with 7. Let's check another example.\n\nExample 1's input has a 1 in row 2, column 3. The output has 7s around it. The input row 2 has a 7 in column 0 and 9. So the maximum value in that row is 7, so the 1's adjacent cells are filled with 7. The 2 in row 10, column 11: the input row 10 has a 3 in column 5 and a 2 in column 11. The maximum in that row is 3. So the adjacent cells are filled with 3. The output for that 2 has 3s to the left (column 10) and below (row 11, column 11). That seems to fit.\n\nExample 2's input has a 1 in row 6, column 10. The input row 6 has a 7 in column 1. The maximum in that row is 7. So the output around the 1 has 7s. The output shows 7s in row 6, column 9 and row 7, column 10. Wait, row 6 in the output is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,0,0,0,0], which has a 7 to the left of the 1. But the maximum in row 6 of the input is 7 (column 1 and 14). So the adjacent cells are filled with 7.\n\nAnother example in Example 2: the 2 is in row 11, column 6. The input row 11 has a 3 in column 14. The maximum in that row is 3, so the adjacent cells are filled with 3. The output shows 3s around the 2: row 11, column 6's adjacent cells. The output row 11 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but wait, the 2 is at column 6, so adjacent cells would be row 11, columns 5 and 7, and rows 10 and 12, column 6. But in the output, the 3 is at column 7. Hmm, this doesn't fit the previous pattern. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value used is the maximum in the entire grid, but that doesn't make sense. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2 is in row 11, column 6. The input has a 3 in row 11, column 14, but the output around the 2 has 3s. But the maximum in row 11 is 3. So the adjacent cells should have 3. But the output shows a 3 to the right (column 7) of the 2. However, in row 11, the output is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So only the right cell is 3. That's confusing. Maybe there's another rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the value is taken from the same column as the 2 or 1. For instance, in Example 0's 2 is in column 3. The input's column 3 has a 3 in row 0 and row 4. The maximum in that column is 3, so the adjacent cells around the 2 (in column 3) are filled with 3. Similarly, the 1 in column 11 of Example 0's input has 7s in column 11 (rows 6 and 14). So the adjacent cells around the 1 in column 11 are filled with 7.\n\nIn Example 1, the 1 is in column 3. The input's column 3 has a 7 in row 0 and a 7 in row 8. So the adjacent cells are filled with 7. The 2 is in column 11. The input's column 11 has a 2 in row 10. But the output uses 3s around it, which comes from row 10, column 5 (3). Wait, perhaps the maximum in the column for the 2's column is considered. The column of the 2 (column 11) in Example 1's input has 2 in row 10 and 3 in row 14 (from Test Input, no, wait, looking back at Example 1's input: the input for column 11 in Example 1: row 10 has 2, row 14 has 3. So the maximum in column 11 is 3. So the adjacent cells around the 2 are filled with 3. That fits with the output.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2's 2 in column 6. The input's column 6 has a 3 in row 0, 3 in row 14, and 2 in row 11. The maximum is 3, so the adjacent cells are filled with 3. But in the output, the 2 at (11,6) has a 3 to the right (column 7). But perhaps the adjacent cells are filled with the maximum of the column, but only in certain directions.\n\nWait, but in Example 2's output for the 2, the 3 is in the same row as the 2, next to it. Maybe the direction depends on where the maximum value is in the column. For example, if the maximum in the column is above the 2, then the cell above is filled; if it's below, then the cell below. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) of the 2 or 1 are filled with the maximum value from their respective row or column. For example, the cell above the 2 gets the max value of the 2's row, the cell below gets the max of the column, etc. But this seems too arbitrary.\n\nLet me try to summarize possible rules:\n\n- For each 2 or 1 in the input grid:\n   - Look at the row and column of that cell.\n   - The maximum value in the row is used to fill the left and right adjacent cells.\n   - The maximum value in the column is used to fill the top and bottom adjacent cells.\n   \nIn Example 0's 2 in row 4, column 3:\n   - Row 4's max is 3.\n   - Column 3's max is 3 (from input rows 0,4,9).\n   So all four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are filled with 3.\n\nIn Example 0's 1 in row 10, column 11:\n   - Row 10's max is 7.\n   - Column 11's max is 7 (from input rows 6,14).\n   So adjacent cells are filled with 7.\n\nIn Example 1's 1 in row 2, column 3:\n   - Row 2's max is 7 (from columns 0 and 9).\n   - Column 3's max is 7 (from rows 0,8).\n   So adjacent cells filled with 7.\n\nExample 1's 2 in row 10, column 11:\n   - Row 10's max is 3 (from column 5).\n   - Column 11's max is 3 (from row 14).\n   So adjacent cells filled with 3.\n\nExample 2's 1 in row 6, column 10:\n   - Row 6's max is 7 (from columns 1 and 14).\n   - Column 10's max is 7 (from row 14, column 10).\n   So adjacent cells filled with 7. The output shows 7 to the left (column 9) and 7 below (row 7, column 10), but maybe only up and down are from column, left and right from row.\n\nWait, in Example 2's 1, the output has a 7 to the left (same row, column 9) and a 7 below (row 7, column 10). So maybe left and right are determined by row's max, up and down by column's max. \n\nSo the rule would be:\n\nFor each cell with 1 or 2:\n\n- The left and right cells in the output are filled with the maximum value from the same row in the input.\n- The top and bottom cells in the output are filled with the maximum value from the same column in the input.\n- If the adjacent cell is already non-zero in the input, perhaps it's left as is? Or replaced?\n\nLooking at Example 0's 2 in row 4, column 3:\n\nRow 4's max is 3. So left (3,3) and right (4,4) are filled with 3.\n\nColumn 3's max is 3, so top (3,3) and bottom (5,3) filled with 3.\n\nIn the output, these cells are indeed 3.\n\nBut in the output for row 4, columns 2 and 4 (left and right of the 2) are 3 and 3. The top and bottom (row 3 and 5, column 3) are 3 and 3. All filled with 3.\n\nIn Example 0's 1 in row 10, column 11:\n\nRow 10's max is 7. So left (10,10) and right (10,12) filled with 7.\n\nColumn 11's max is 7. So top (9,11) and bottom (11,11) filled with 7.\n\nIn the output, these are indeed 7s.\n\nAnother example: Example 2's 2 in row 11, column 6:\n\nRow 11's input has a 2 and a 3 in column 14. The max in row 11's input is 3. So left and right cells (11,5 and 11,7) would be filled with 3. But in the output, row 11 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the right cell (11,7) is 3, but the left cell (11,5) remains 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Unless there's a different rule. Wait, the input for row 11 in Example 2 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]. So the max in row 11 is 3 (column 14). But the 3 is at column 14. So the left and right of the 2 (column 6) would be filled with 3. But the right cell (column 7) is filled with 3. The left cell (column 5) is 0. That doesn't match. Unless the rule is to take the first non-zero value in the row, not the max. Wait, in row 11, the first non-zero is 2 at column 6, then 3 at 14. So maybe it's the first non-zero value, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the row's max is taken, regardless of where it is. So row 11's max is 3, so left and right of the 2 are filled with 3. But why only the right cell? Maybe because the left cell is out of bounds or there's another rule. Wait, the 2 is in column 6, so left is column 5, right is column 7. In the output, column 7 is 3. But column 5 remains 0. So this doesn't fit the previous pattern.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern isn't simply taking the max of the row and column. So perhaps there's another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Look at how the numbers are moved. In Example 0, the 3 in row 0, column 3 is in the input. In the output, there's a 3 in row 3, column 3. So maybe the 3 is moved down to be adjacent to the 2. Similarly, the 3 in row 9, column 3 of the input moves up to row 3, column 3. Wait, no. In the output for Example 0, the 3 is in row 3, column 3, which is directly above the 2 in row 4. So perhaps the 3s that are in the same column as the 2 but above and below are moved to adjacent positions.\n\nBut in the input for Example 0, column 3 has 3s in rows 0,4 (the 2 is here), and 9. So the 3 in row 0 is moved down to row 3 (above the 2), and the 3 in row 9 is moved up to row 5 (below the 2). Wait, the output's row 3, column 3 is 3, and row 5, column 3 is 3. The input's row 4, column 3 is the 2.\n\nSo maybe the 3s in the same column as the 2 but in other rows are moved to the adjacent rows around the 2. Similarly, any 3s in the same row as the 2 (but other columns) are moved to adjacent columns around the 2.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's 2 is in row 4, column 3. The input has 3s in column 3 at rows 0 and 9. These are moved to rows 3 and 5 (adjacent rows) in the same column. Similarly, the 3s in the same row (row 4) at columns 0 and 8 are moved to columns 2 and 4 (adjacent columns) in the same row. So the output around the 2 has 3s from both the row and column.\n\nSimilarly, the 1 in row 10, column 11. The input has 7s in column 11 at rows 6 and 14. These are moved to rows 9 and 11 (adjacent to row 10) in the same column. The 7s in row 10 at columns 5 and 14 are moved to columns 10 and 12 (adjacent to column 11) in the same row. So the output around the 1 has 7s from both row and column.\n\nThis seems plausible. So the pattern is:\n\nFor each 1 or 2 in the input, look for non-zero numbers in the same row and column. Then, in the output, those numbers are placed in the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) of the 1 or 2. Specifically:\n\n- For the same column: non-zero numbers above and below the 1/2 are moved to the immediate adjacent rows (up and down).\n- For the same row: non-zero numbers to the left and right are moved to the immediate adjacent columns (left and right).\n\nWait, but how? Let's see. Take Example 0's 2 in row 4, column 3.\n\nIn the same column (column 3), the input has 3s in rows 0,4 (the 2), and 9. The non-zero numbers above the 2 are row 0, and below are row 9. So in the output, these are moved to rows 3 (up) and 5 (down) of column 3. So the 3 from row 0 is moved down to row 3, and the 3 from row 9 is moved up to row 5.\n\nIn the same row (row 4), the input has 3s at columns 0 and 8. These are moved to columns 2 (left) and 4 (right) of row 4. So the 3 from column 0 is moved right to column 2, and the 3 from column 8 is moved left to column 4?\n\nWait, but row 4's 3s are at columns 0 and 8. The 2 is at column 3. So the adjacent columns would be 2 and 4. So moving the 3 from column 0 (far left) to column 2 (two steps right), and the 3 from column 8 (far right) to column 4 (four steps left) doesn't make sense. Unless the rule is that for each non-zero in the same row, regardless of position, we add it to the adjacent cells of the 2/1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero values in the same row and column are used to fill the adjacent cells. For example, the cells to the left and right of the 2/1 are filled with the leftmost and rightmost non-zero values in the same row, and the cells above and below are filled with the topmost and bottommost non-zero values in the same column.\n\nIn Example 0's 2 (row 4, column 3):\n\nRow 4 has non-zero values at columns 0 (3), 3 (2), and 8 (3). The leftmost non-zero is 3 at column 0, rightmost is 3 at column 8. So in the output, the left adjacent cell (column 2) and right adjacent cell (column 4) are filled with 3 (leftmost and rightmost values). The column 3 has non-zero values at rows 0 (3),4 (2), and 9 (3). The topmost is 3 at row 0, bottommost is 3 at row 9. So the cells above (row 3) and below (row 5) are filled with 3. This matches the output.\n\nSimilarly, the 1 in row 10, column 11:\n\nRow 10 has non-zero values at columns 5 (7), 11 (1), and 14 (7). Leftmost is 7 at column 5, rightmost is 7 at column 14. So left adjacent (column 10) and right adjacent (column 12) are filled with 7. Column 11 has non-zero values at rows 6 (7),10 (1), and 14 (7). Topmost is 7 at row 6, bottommost is 7 at row 14. So cells above (row 9) and below (row 11) are filled with 7. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 1's 1 in row 2, column 3:\n\nRow 2 has non-zero values at columns 0 (7),3 (1), and 9 (7). Leftmost is 7, rightmost is 7. So left and right cells (columns 2 and 4) filled with 7. Column 3 has non-zero values at rows 0 (7),2 (1), and 8 (7). Topmost is 7 (row 0), bottommost is 7 (row 8). So cells above (row 1) and below (row 3) filled with 7. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 2's 1 in row 6, column 10:\n\nRow 6 has non-zero values at columns 1 (7),10 (1), and 14 (7). Leftmost is 7 at column 1, rightmost is 7 at column 14. So left adjacent (column 9) and right adjacent (column 11) filled with 7. Column 10 has non-zero values at row 6 (1), row 14 (7). Topmost is 1 (row 6), bottommost is 7 (row 14). So cells above (row 5) and below (row 7) filled with 7 (since bottommost is 7). Wait, but the output for this 1 is in row 6, column 10. The output has row 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,0,0,0,0]. So the left adjacent is 7 (column 9). The right adjacent (column 11) is 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, in Example 2's input, row 6 has 7 at column 1 and 14. So leftmost is 7 at column 1, rightmost is 7 at column 14. So left adjacent (column 9) is not 7. Maybe this pattern doesn't hold here. Or maybe there's an exception.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the left and right adjacent cells are filled with the leftmost and rightmost non-zero values in the row, but only if they are to the left or right of the 1/2. Wait, but in Example 2's row 6, the 1 is at column 10. The leftmost non-zero in the row is column 1 (7), which is to the left of the 1, and the rightmost is column 14 (7), which is to the right. But the output for row 6, column 9 is 7 (left adjacent) and column 11 is 0. So why is column 9 filled with 7?\n\nMaybe the left adjacent cell is filled with the closest non-zero to the left of the 1/2 in the same row, and the right adjacent cell is filled with the closest non-zero to the right of the 1/2 in the same row.\n\nIn Example 0's row 4, the 2 is at column 3. The closest non-zero to the left is column 0 (3), and to the right is column 8 (3). So left adjacent (column 2) and right adjacent (column 4) are filled with 3. But that's not the closest. The closest would be the first non-zero to the left and right. But in row 4 of Example 0, the 2 is at column 3, and there are no non-zero values between 0 and 3 (columns 0-3). So the leftmost non-zero is column 0, which is the closest to the left. Similarly, the rightmost is column 8. So the left adjacent cell gets the value from the closest left non-zero, and the right adjacent gets the closest right non-zero.\n\nIn Example 2's row 6, the 1 is at column 10. The closest non-zero to the left in the same row is column 1 (7), but that's far away. The next non-zero to the left of 10 would be none, since columns 0-9 have only column 1 and 5 (wait, no, in Example 2's input row 6 is [0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. So row 6 has 7 at column 1, 1 at column 10, and 7 at column 14. So the closest non-zero to the left of the 1 (column 10) is column 1 (7), but that's far. There's nothing in between. So perhaps the left adjacent cell (column 9) is filled with 7, which is the leftmost non-zero in the row (column 1's 7). But that's not adjacent. Alternatively, maybe if there are no non-zero values to the left or right, then adjacent cells are not filled. But in Example 2's output, the left adjacent cell (column 9) is filled with 7. That suggests that even if there are no non-zero values between the 1/2 and the edges, the leftmost and rightmost non-zero values are used.\n\nBut this would mean that for Example 2's 1 in row 6, the left adjacent cell (column 9) is filled with the leftmost non-zero in the row (column 1's 7), which is far away. This doesn't make sense. So perhaps this pattern isn't correct.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to apply the initial pattern to the test input and see if it fits.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\nRow 3: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\nRow 6: [7,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7]\nRow 12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nSo in the test input, there are:\n\n- A 3 in row 0, column 11.\n- A 3 in row 3, column 0 and a 2 in column 11.\n- A 1 in row 6, column 5, with 7s in columns 0 and 14.\n- A 3 in row 12, column 11.\n\nSo applying the pattern where for each 1 or 2, the adjacent cells are filled with the leftmost and rightmost non-zero from their row, and topmost and bottommost from their column.\n\nFor the 2 in row 3, column 11:\n\nRow 3 has non-zero at column 0 (3) and 11 (2). Leftmost is 3 (column 0), rightmost is 2 (column 11). So left adjacent (column 10) filled with 3, right adjacent (column 12) filled with 2. But since the cell itself is 2, maybe the rightmost non-zero excluding itself. Wait, the 2 is part of the row's non-zero. So perhaps leftmost is 3 (column 0), rightmost is 2 (column 11). But the right adjacent cell is column 12, which would be filled with 2. But in the output, maybe this 2 is not present. Alternatively, maybe the rightmost non-zero excluding the 2 itself. So row 3's non-zero entries are 3 (column 0) and 2 (column 11). So rightmost non-zero excluding 2 is none. So perhaps only the left adjacent is filled with 3.\n\nFor the column 11 (of the 2 in row 3), the non-zero entries are row 0 (3), row 3 (2), and row 12 (3). Topmost is 3 (row 0), bottommost is 3 (row 12). So the cells above (row 2) and below (row 4) are filled with 3.\n\nFor the 1 in row 6, column 5:\n\nRow 6 has non-zero entries at column 0 (7), 5 (1), and 14 (7). Leftmost is 7 (column 0), rightmost is 7 (column 14). So left adjacent (column 4) filled with 7, right adjacent (column 6) filled with 7.\n\nColumn 5 has non-zero entries at row 6 (1), and perhaps others. Let's check the input for column 5. The test input has 1 in row 6, column 5, and other rows have zeros. So topmost and bottommost for column 5 are only the 1 itself. So no other non-zero entries. So maybe the adjacent cells above and below are filled with nothing (remain 0).\n\nBut in the output, how should it look?\n\nPutting this together:\n\nFor the 2 in row 3, column 11:\n\n- Left adjacent (column 10): 3 (from row 3's leftmost non-zero)\n- Right adjacent (column 12): 2 (but since it's the 2 itself, maybe 0)\n- Top adjacent (row 2, column 11): 3 (from column's topmost)\n- Bottom adjacent (row 4, column 11): 3 (from column's bottommost)\n\nFor the 1 in row 6, column 5:\n\n- Left adjacent (column 4): 7\n- Right adjacent (column 6): 7\n- Top adjacent (row 5, column 5): 0 (no non-zero above)\n- Bottom adjacent (row 7, column 5): 0 (no non-zero below)\n\nBut according to the pattern from the examples, even if there's no non-zero in the column above or below, they would be filled with the topmost and bottommost. But in this case, the column only has the 1. So maybe the top and bottom are filled with 0. But that's not how the previous examples worked. In Example 0's column 11 for the 1, there were 7s above and below. So maybe when there are non-zero values in the column, they are used. Otherwise, if none, they remain 0.\n\nAdditionally, the test input has a 3 in row 12, column 11. So for that 3, if it's not a 1 or 2, it's not processed.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nOutput for the 2 in row 3, column 11:\n\n- Row 3, column 10 becomes 3 (from row's leftmost)\n- Row 3, column 12 becomes 0 (since row's rightmost is 2, but maybe not)\nWait, but the row's rightmost is the 2 itself, so maybe the right adjacent is 0.\n\nBut in previous examples, like Example 0's row 4, the rightmost non-zero (column 8's 3) was used for the right adjacent cell. So perhaps even if the rightmost is after the 2, it's used. But in the test input's row 3, the 2 is at column 11. The rightmost non-zero in the row is column 11 (the 2 itself), so perhaps there's no right adjacent non-zero, so the right adjacent cell is 0.\n\nBut the column's topmost is 3 (row 0), bottommost is 3 (row 12). So cells above (row 2, column 11) and below (row 4, column 11) are filled with 3.\n\nFor the 1 in row 6, column 5:\n\n- Left adjacent (column 4) filled with 7 (row's leftmost)\n- Right adjacent (column 6) filled with 7 (row's rightmost)\n- Top adjacent (row 5, column 5) filled with 0 (no non-zero above)\n- Bottom adjacent (row 7, column 5) filled with 0 (no non-zero below)\n\nSo the output for row 6 would have 7s in columns 4 and 6.\n\nAdditionally, the test input has a 3 in row 0, column 11 and row 12, column 11. These are in the same column as the 2 in row 3, column 11. So their presence affects the 2's adjacent cells.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe output grid would have:\n\nFor the 2 in row 3, column 11:\n\n- Row 2, column 11: 3\n- Row 4, column 11: 3\n- Row 3, column 10: 3\n- Row 3, column 12: 0 (since no right non-zero beyond the 2)\n\nFor the 1 in row 6, column 5:\n\n- Row 6, column 4: 7\n- Row 6, column 6: 7\n- Row 5, column 5: 0\n- Row 7, column 5: 0\n\nOther 3s in the input (row 0, 12) are not 1/2, so their cells remain unchanged unless affected by other transformations.\n\nSo the output for the test input would look like:\n\nRow 3: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [7,0,0,0,7,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7]\n\nBut wait, row 6 in the test input is [7,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7]. So in the output, columns 4 and 6 would be 7.\n\nAlso, the 7s in row 6's columns 0 and 14 are part of the input. But according to the pattern, they would remain as they are, since they are not 1 or 2. So the output row 6 would be [7,0,0,0,7,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7].\n\nBut in the training examples, other non-zero cells that are not 1 or 2 are not present in the output. For example, in Example 0's input, the 3s in row 0 and 9 are not present in the output. Instead, their values are moved to the cells around the 2 and 1. So perhaps the output grid is formed by only the transformations around the 1 and 2, and other non-zero cells are zeroed out.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input and output: the input has 3s in row 0, column 3; row 4, columns 0,3,8; row 6, column 11; row 9, column 3; row 10, columns 5 and 14; row 14, column 11. The output only has the transformed cells around the 2 and 1, and other cells are zero. So the pattern is that all original non-zero cells (except 1 and 2) are zeroed out, and the only non-zero cells are those generated by the transformation around 1 and 2.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each cell in the input that is a 1 or 2:\n\n   a. Look at the same row and find the leftmost and rightmost non-zero cells (excluding the 1/2 itself).\n\n   b. Look at the same column and find the topmost and bottommost non-zero cells (excluding the 1/2 itself).\n\n   c. In the output, set the left and right adjacent cells to the values of the leftmost and rightmost non-zero cells from the row.\n\n   d. Set the top and bottom adjacent cells to the values of the topmost and bottommost non-zero cells from the column.\n\n2. All other cells in the output are zero, except the 1 and 2 themselves.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nFor the 2 in row 3, column 11:\n\nRow 3's non-zero cells (excluding column 11) are column 0 (3). Leftmost is 3 (column 0). Rightmost is none (since column 11 is the 2 itself). So left adjacent (column 10) is set to 3. Right adjacent (column 12) is zero.\n\nColumn 11's non-zero cells (excluding row 3) are row 0 (3) and row 12 (3). Topmost is 3 (row 0), bottommost is 3 (row 12). So top adjacent (row 2, column 11) is 3. Bottom adjacent (row 4, column 11) is 3.\n\nFor the 1 in row 6, column 5:\n\nRow 6's non-zero cells (excluding column 5) are columns 0 (7) and 14 (7). Leftmost is 7 (column 0). Rightmost is 7 (column 14). So left adjacent (column 4) is 7. Right adjacent (column 6) is 7.\n\nColumn 5's non-zero cells (excluding row 6) are none. So top and bottom adjacent cells (row 5 and 7, column 5) remain 0.\n\nAdditionally, the 3 in row 0, column 11 and row 12, column 11 are non-1/2, so they are zeroed out in the output.\n\nThus, the output for the test input would have:\n\n- In row 2, column 11: 3\n- In row 3, column 10: 3\n- In row 4, column 11: 3\n- In row 6, columns 4 and 6: 7\n- The 2 remains at row 3, column 11\n- The 1 remains at row 6, column 5\n- All other cells are zero.\n\nNow, let's construct the output grid accordingly.\n\nThe test input's rows are 15 in total. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: all zeros except possibly influenced by transformations. But the 3 in row 0, column 11 is a non-1/2, so it becomes zero.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: has 3 at column 11.\n\nRow 3: has 3 at column 10, 2 at 11, and zeros elsewhere.\n\nRow 4: has 3 at column 11.\n\nRow 5: all zeros.\n\nRow 6: has 7 at columns 0,4,6,14 (but wait, according to the transformation, only columns 4 and 6 are set to 7, and the original 7s at columns 0 and 14 would be zeroed out. Because in the examples, the original non-1/2 cells are removed. So row 6 in the output would be [0,0,0,0,7,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 7: all zeros.\n\nRow 8: all zeros.\n\nRow 9: all zeros.\n\nRow 10: all zeros.\n\nRow 11: all zeros.\n\nRow 12: has 3 at column 11 in the input, but since it's not a 1 or 2, it's zeroed out.\n\nRow 13: all zeros.\n\nRow 14: all zeros.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nThe output should be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n[3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,7,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but row 3 in the output has the original 3 at column 0 from the input. But according to the pattern, all non-1/2 cells are zeroed out. However, in the transformation for the 2 in row 3, column 11, the left adjacent cell (column 10) is set to 3, and the row's leftmost non-zero (column 0) is 3. But the 3 in column 0 of row 3 is a non-1/2 cell, so it should be zeroed out. Wait, but in Example 0's input, the 3 in row 4, column 0 is part of the input and is zeroed out in the output. So in the test input's row 3, column 0 has a 3 in the input, but it's not a 1 or 2, so it should be zero in the output. Therefore, row 3 in the output should be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0]\n\nBecause the original 3 in column 0 is zeroed out. The 3 in column 10 comes from the transformation of the 2.\n\nSimilarly, in row 6, the original 7s in columns 0 and 14 are zeroed out, leaving only the 7s in columns 4 and 6.\n\nSo the correct output would have:\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,7,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nAnd all other rows as per the transformations.",

Let's start by looking at the training examples.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some numbers like 3, 2, 7, 1. The output seems to have those same numbers, but arranged differently. For instance, in the input's 4th row, there's a 3, 0, 0, 2, 0... and in the output's 4th row, it's 0,0,3,2,3. Hmm, so maybe the 3s are placed around the 2? Like surrounding it on either side? And in the same example, the 1 in the input is at row 10, column 12 (assuming 0-based indexing), and in the output, there's a 1 surrounded by 7s. So perhaps when there's a number, the adjacent cells get filled with a different number?\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has a 1 in row 2, column 3. The output has 7s around that 1. Similarly, in Example 0, the 2 is in the middle of 3s, and the 1 is surrounded by 7s. So maybe each number (like 2,1) has a certain value that is placed around them. Like 1 is surrounded by 7s, 2 by 3s, and 3 by something else? Wait, but in Example 0, the 3 in row 0, column 3 is in the input. The output's 3rd row has 3 in column 3, but then the 4th row has 3s around the 2. So maybe the 2 causes 3s to be placed around it. Similarly, the 1 in the input (like in Example 0's row 10, column 12) has 7s around it in the output.\n\nWait, let's check the positions. For the 2 in Example 0's input: row 4, column 3. In the output, row 4, columns 2,3,4 are 3,2,3. So the 2 is in the center, and the adjacent left and right cells (same row) are 3. Similarly, in the same example, the 1 in row 10, column 11 (input) becomes surrounded by 7s in the same row (columns 10 and 12) and the row above and below? Let me check. In the output for Example 0's 1, it's row 10, column 11 (1), with 7s at row 10, columns 10 and 12 (left and right), and perhaps row 9, column 11 and row 11, column 11? Wait, in the output, row 9 has 3s, but in the output row 10, the 1 is surrounded by 7s. Let me check the input of Example 0 again.\n\nWait, input row 10: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7]. The output row 10 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 1, 7, 0, 0]. So the 1 was at position 11 in input, and in output, it's at 11 with 7s at 10 and 12. Also, in output row 9, column 11 has 0, but row 10, columns 10 and 12 have 7s. So maybe the rule is that when there's a number N, you place another number around it in adjacent cells. For example, 1 is surrounded by 7s, 2 by 3s, 3 by maybe 0s or another number?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input. The input has a 1 in row 6, column 10. The output in row 6 has 7s in column 9 and 10? Wait, output row 6 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,0,0,0,0]. So the 1 is at column 10, and to the left (column 9) is 7, and the row below (row 7) column 10 is 7. So perhaps the 1 is surrounded by 7s in all four directions (up, down, left, right), but in this case, maybe only left and down? Hmm, maybe the direction varies, or perhaps it's a cross pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output for the 2: the 2 is at row 4, column 3. The output row 4 has 3s at columns 2, 3 (no, wait, the row is [0,0,3,2,3,0...], so columns 2,3,4: 3,2,3. So the 2 is flanked by 3s on left and right. But in the input, the 2 was at that position. So maybe the rule is that when a number X is present, you place Y around it in adjacent cells. For example, 1 \u2192 7s around it, 2 \u2192 3s around it, 3 \u2192 something else?\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in row 10, column 11. The output in row 10 has 2 at column 11, with 3 to the left (column 10) and 0 to the right. Wait, Example 1's output row 10 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0]. So the 2 is at column 11, with 3 to the left (column 10) and 0 to the right. Wait, that doesn't fit the previous pattern. Or maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the 2 is at row 10, column 11. The output shows that in row 10, column 11 is 2, and column 10 is 3, column 12 is 0. But perhaps there's more to it. Maybe the surrounding is in a different direction, like vertical. Let me check other parts of Example 1's output. The 1 in row 2, column 3 is surrounded by 7s in row 1, column 3 (7), row 2 columns 2 and 4 (7s), and row 3 column 3 (7). So maybe the 1s are surrounded by 7s in a cross pattern (up, down, left, right). Similarly, the 2 in Example 0 is flanked by 3s left and right. But then in Example 1, the 2 is flanked by a 3 to the left and nothing to the right. Hmm, maybe there's a different rule here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being moved. For example, in Example 0's input, the 3s in row 0 and row 9 of the input are in column 3, but in the output, those 3s are moved down or up. Wait, the input's row 0 has [0,0,0,3,0...], and in the output, row 3 has [0,0,0,3,0...]. So maybe the 3 is shifted down by 3 rows? But then other elements also shift. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different transformation.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each non-zero number, placing adjacent numbers based on the value. For instance, when there's a 1, place 7s around it (up, down, left, right). When there's a 2, place 3s around it. When there's a 3, maybe place 0s? Or perhaps another number. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2 is in row 4, column 3. The output in that row is 3,2,3. So left and right are 3s. Similarly, the 1 in row 10, column 11 has 7s left and right. But in Example 2's output, the 1 in row 6, column 10 has 7 to the left and below. Wait, maybe the direction varies, but the numbers are determined by the original number.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: for each number N in the input, place M in adjacent cells (left, right, up, down), where M depends on N. For example:\n\n- 1 \u2192 place 7s in adjacent cells\n- 2 \u2192 place 3s in adjacent cells\n- 3 \u2192 place 0s? Or maybe another number. Wait, looking at Example 0's input where there's a 3 in row 0, column 3. The output row 3 has a 3, but maybe that's part of the 2's transformation. So perhaps the 3s in the input are not generating anything, but when they are part of the output, they are part of the 2's surrounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s in the input are moved down or something. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input: the input has a 3 in row 0, column 6. The output has 3s in rows 10, 11, 12 around the 2. Wait, the input's row 11 has a 2 in column 6. The output row 10 has 3 in column 6, row 11 has 2 and 3 (columns 6 and 7?), and row 12 has 3 in column 6. So maybe the 2 is surrounded by 3s above, same row right, and below. But in this case, the 2 is in row 11, column 6 of the input. The output row 10 column 6 is 3, row 11 column 6 is 2, row 11 column 7 is 3, and row 12 column 6 is 3. So the 3s are placed above, to the right, and below. Hmm, that's a different pattern than previous examples.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe another approach: the output is formed by taking each non-zero cell in the input and creating a cross (up, down, left, right) of another number around it, overwriting existing cells. The number placed depends on the original number. For example:\n\n- If a cell has 1, place 7s in the cross directions.\n- If a cell has 2, place 3s in the cross directions.\n- If a cell has 3, maybe place something else, but in Example 0, the 3 in row 0, column 3 is in the input. The output has that 3 moved down to row 3, column 3, but that might be part of the 2's cross.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 2 is in row 4, column 3. The output around it has 3s to the left and right. So perhaps when there's a 2, place 3s to the left and right. And when there's a 1, place 7s up, down, left, right. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 1 is in row 10, column 11. The output has 7s to the left (column 10) and right (column 12) in the same row. But also, looking at the rows above and below. The output row 9, column 11 is 0, but row 11, column 11 is 0. So maybe only left and right? Or maybe it's that when placing, existing non-zero cells are overwritten.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each number N in the input is replaced by a cross of N's value minus 1 (but that doesn't fit 1 \u21927). Alternatively, 1 \u21927, 2\u21923, 3\u2192 something else.\n\nWait, 7 is 1 + 6, 3 is 2 +1. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 1 and 7 are paired, 2 and 3 are paired. So when you have a 1, you put 7s around it; when you have a 2, you put 3s around it. And when you have a 3, perhaps you put 0s (but that's not visible). But then why in Example 1's input, the 7 is in row 0, column 3. The output has 7s in row 1, column 3 and row 2, columns 2 and 4. So maybe the 7s are part of another transformation. But maybe the 7s are part of the 1's transformation.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are grouped: 1 and 7 are linked, 2 and 3 are linked, etc. So when a 1 is present, you place 7s around it, and when a 2 is present, you place 3s around it. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\n- The 2 at (4,3) causes 3s left and right (3,2,3).\n- The 1 at (10,11) causes 7s left and right (7,1,7).\n- The 7s in the input (e.g., row 6, column 11, and row 14, column 14) in the output, what happens? In output row 14, column 11 is 0. So maybe the 7s in the input don't generate anything. So the rule is only certain numbers (like 1,2) generate surrounding numbers, others are left as is or overwritten.\n\nSo the possible rule is: For each cell in the input, if the cell is 1, place 7s in adjacent cells (left, right, up, down). If the cell is 2, place 3s in adjacent cells. If the cell is 3, maybe place something else, but looking at the examples, maybe 3s are part of the 2's transformation. Wait, in Example 0's input, there's a 3 in row 0, column 3. The output row 3, column 3 has a 3. But perhaps that's because the original 3 is moved down by 3 rows. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe 3s in the input are transformed into something else. But in Example 0's input, there are 3s in row 4, column 0 and 8, but the output has 3s around the 2. Maybe the 3s in the input are part of the output's original positions, but when a 2 is present, the 3s are added around it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each non-zero number in the input is shifted down by a certain number of rows. For example, in Example 0's input, the 3 in row 0, column 3 is moved to row 3 in the output. The 3 in row 4, column 0 is moved to row 4, column 2. Hmm, but that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by moving each number down by its own value. For example, a 3 in the input moves down 3 rows. But checking Example 0's input: the 3 in row 0, column 3 would move to row 3 (0+3=3), which matches the output's row 3, column 3. The 3 in row 4, column 0 would move down 3 rows to row 7, but in the output, row 4 has a 3 in column 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's look at the test input and see if applying the possible rule would help.\n\nThe test input has:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,...,3 at column 11]\nRow 3: [3,0,...,2 at column 11]\nRow 6: [7,0,...,1 at column 5, 7 at column 14]\nRow 12: [0,0,...,3 at column 11]\n\nSo applying the rule where 1s generate 7s around them, 2s generate 3s, 3s generate... perhaps nothing. But let's see.\n\nIn the test input, the 1 is at row 6, column 5. So according to the pattern, we should place 7s around it (left, right, up, down). So in output row 6, columns 4,5,6 (left, same, right) and rows 5 and 7, column 5.\n\nBut the input row 6 has 7 in column 0 and 14, but those might be original 7s. The output should have 7s around the 1.\n\nThe 2 in the input is at row 3, column 11. So according to the pattern, we should place 3s around it (left, right, up, down). So in row 3, columns 10 and 12 (left and right), and rows 2 and 4, column 11.\n\nThe 3 in row 0, column 11 would generate... maybe nothing, but according to previous examples, 3s are generated by 2s. Wait, in Example 0, the 3 in row 0, column 3 is part of the input. The output row 3, column 3 has a 3. So perhaps 3s are moved down by 3 rows. Because row 0 + 3 = row 3. Similarly, in Example 2's input, there's a 3 in row 0, column 6. The output has a 3 in row 10, column 6. Wait, 0 + 3 = 3, but row 10 is way down. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe it's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number N is shifted down by N rows. So 3 shifts down 3 rows. Let's check Example 0's 3 in row 0, column 3: 0+3=3. Output row 3, column 3 has a 3. That matches. The 3 in row 4, column 0: 4+3=7, but the output row 4, column 2 has a 3, which doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are shifted vertically by their own value. For example, 3 moves down 3 rows. But the 3 in row 0 moves to row 3. The 3 in row 9 of Example 0's input would move to row 12. But the output of Example 0's row 9 has a 3 at column 3. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s in the output are generated by the 2s. So whenever a 2 is present, we place 3s around it. So the 2 in the test input at row 3, column 11 would have 3s left, right, up, down. Let's see:\n\nIn row 3, column 11: 2. So adjacent cells would be row 3, columns 10 (left) and 12 (right), row 2 and 4, column 11 (up and down). So these cells would be set to 3. But existing values would be overwritten. For example, the input's row 3, column 0 is 3, but the output may not retain that.\n\nSimilarly, the 1 in row 6, column 5 would generate 7s around it: row 6, columns 4 and 6; rows 5 and 7, column 5.\n\nNow, let's look at the test input's row 12, column 11: 3. If 3s are generated by something else, maybe that 3 is part of another transformation. But in Example 0, the output's 3s in row 3 are from the input's 3 in row 0. So perhaps 3s are moved down by 3 rows. So the 3 in test input row 0, column 11 would move to row 3, column 11. The 3 in row 12, column 11 would move to row 15, but since there are only 15 rows (0-14), that's out of bounds. So maybe that 3 in row 12 is moved down by 3 rows to row 15 (invalid), so it's not present. Alternatively, maybe the 3s in the input are shifted down by their own value (3 rows). So row 0 +3 =3, row 3's 3 would move to 6, row 12's 3 would move to 15, which is out of the grid.\n\nBut how does that fit with Example 0's input, where the 3 in row 0 moves to row 3, and in the output, there's a 3 in row 3. That seems to fit. Similarly, the 3 in row 9 of the input would move to row 12. But in Example 0's output, there's a 3 in row 9, column 3. Wait, that doesn't fit. So maybe the shifting is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the 3s in the input are not moved but are part of the output as is, unless overwritten by other transformations.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to apply the possible pattern to the test input step by step.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow 0: [...,3 at col 11]\nRow 3: [3,0,...,2 at col 11]\nRow 6: [7,0,...,1 at col5, 7 at col14]\nRow 12: [...,3 at col11]\n\nAssuming the transformations are:\n\n- For each 1, place 7s in left, right, up, down cells.\n- For each 2, place 3s in left, right, up, down cells.\n- For each 3, maybe no action, unless they are part of another transformation.\n\nSo let's process each non-zero cell in the input:\n\n1. The 3 in row 0, col11: If 3s are not generating anything, then it remains. But in Example 0, the 3 in row 0, col3 was moved to row3, col3. So maybe 3s are shifted down by 3 rows. So row0 +3 = row3. So this 3 would be placed in row3, col11. But in the input's row3, col11 is a 2. Would this overwrite the 2? Probably not. Wait, but in Example0's input, the 3 in row0, col3 is in output row3, col3. But in Example0's output row3, there's a 3. So maybe 3s are moved down by 3 rows, but if the target cell is non-zero, it's overwritten. But in Example0's input row4 has a 3 in col0. Moving down 3 rows would be row7, col0, but the output row4 has a 3 in col2, which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are left as is, but when a 2 is present, they are placed around it. So the 2 in row3, col11 would generate 3s around it. So the cells around it (left, right, up, down) become 3. Let's focus on that.\n\nSo for the 2 at (3,11):\n\n- Left: (3,10) \u2192 set to 3\n- Right: (3,12) \u2192 set to 3\n- Up: (2,11) \u2192 set to3\n- Down: (4,11) \u2192 set to3\n\nBut the original input at (3,11) is 2, so the output will have 2 there, and the adjacent cells as 3.\n\nFor the 1 at (6,5):\n\n- Left: (6,4) \u2192 7\n- Right: (6,6) \u21927\n- Up: (5,5) \u21927\n- Down: (7,5) \u21927\n\nSo those cells become 7.\n\nAlso, the 3 in row0, col11: if the rule is that 3s are moved down by 3 rows, then row0+3=3, col11. But in row3, col11, there's a 2. So maybe the 2 takes precedence and the 3 is not placed there. Or maybe the 3 is moved but the 2 overwrites it. So the output row3, col11 would be 2 (original) and the surrounding cells are 3s from the 2's transformation.\n\nThe 3 in row12, col11: moving down 3 rows would be row15, which is out of bounds, so it's ignored.\n\nThe 7s in row6, col0 and col14: since 7s don't generate anything (based on previous examples), they remain as is unless overwritten by other transformations. For example, row6, col0 is 7 in the input, so it stays unless another transformation writes there. But in this case, the 1's transformation at (6,5) doesn't affect col0. So the 7s in row6, col0 and 14 remain.\n\nNow, the test input's row12, col11 has a 3. If this 3 is moved down 3 rows, it would be row15, which is out of bounds. So it's ignored.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\n- The 2 in row3, col11 generates 3s in (3,10), (3,12), (2,11), (4,11).\n- The 1 in row6, col5 generates 7s in (6,4), (6,6), (5,5), (7,5).\n- The 3 in row0, col11 moves to row3, col11, but that cell is already occupied by the 2, so maybe it's not placed, or it's overwritten. But in Example0, the 3 in row0, col3 was moved to row3, col3, which didn't have any other number. So maybe the moved 3 is placed only if the target cell is 0. So in this case, row3, col11 is 2, so the moved 3 doesn't appear there. Hence, the 3 from row0, col11 would be in row3, col11 only if it's empty. But it's not, so it's not placed. So the output for row3, col11 remains 2 with surrounding 3s.\n\nAdditionally, the test input's row12, col11 has a 3. If we apply the same movement rule, moving down 3 rows (12+3=15, invalid), so it's ignored.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\n- Row3: [3,0,0,0,...] \u2192 original input row3 starts with 3. Then, due to the 2 at col11, the 3's movement and the 2's transformation. Wait, no. The input row3 is [3,0,0,...,2 at col11]. The moved 3 from row0, col11 would go to row3, col11, which has a 2, so the 3 isn't placed there. The 2's transformation adds 3s around it.\n\nSo row3 in output would have:\n\n- At col0: 3 (original input)\n- At col11: 2 (original)\n- At col10 and 12: 3s (from 2's transformation)\n- At row2 and 4, col11: 3s.\n\nBut wait, the output is a grid. So for the 2 at (3,11), the cells (3,10), (3,12), (2,11), (4,11) become 3.\n\nThen, the 3 in row3, col0 remains as is.\n\nNow, the 1 in row6, col5 would generate 7s at (6,4), (6,6), (5,5), (7,5).\n\nAdditionally, the input's row6 has 7s in col0 and 14. Those remain unless overwritten. The generated 7s are only around the 1.\n\nPutting this all together, the output rows would look like:\n\nRow0: All zeros except maybe the moved 3, but since it's moved to row3, which has a 2, it's not present. So row0 is all zeros.\n\nRow3: [3, 0, 0, ... 3 (col10), 2 (col11), 3 (col12), ...]\n\nRow6: [7,0,0,0,7 (col4),1 (col5),7 (col6), ...,7 (col14)]\n\nRow5: [0,0,...,7 in col5]\n\nRow7: [0,0,...,7 in col5]\n\nRows2 and4: At col11, 3s.\n\nNow, let's also check other possible elements. For example, the 3 in row3, col0 (original input) would remain as 3 unless modified by another transformation. Since there's no transformation affecting that cell, it stays.\n\nSo the output grid would have:\n\n- Row3: 3 in col0, 3s around col11 (due to the 2).\n- Row6: 7s around the 1, and original 7s in col0 and 14.\n- Rows5 and7: 7s in col5.\n\nThe test input's row12 has a 3 in col11. Moving down 3 rows is out of bounds, so it's not placed. So row12 in output would have the 3 from the input unless moved. But since moving it down is out of bounds, it's not present, and the original 3 in row12, col11 would either stay or be removed. Wait, according to the movement rule, maybe the 3s are moved, but if that's invalid, they are removed. So the 3 in row12, col11 would be moved to row15, which is not present, so it's removed. Hence, row12, col11 in the output is 0, unless another transformation affects it. The test input's row12, col11 has a 3, but according to the movement rule, it's gone. However, there's a 3 in the input's row12, col11. If the rule is to move down by 3 rows, then it's out of bounds, so the output would not have it. Therefore, row12 in the output is all zeros except for possible transformations from other numbers. But there are no numbers near row12 that would affect it, so it's 0.\n\nThe test input's row12, col11 has a 3. In the output, if the rule is to move it down 3 rows, it's gone. But maybe there's another 3 in the output. For example, if there's a 2 in row12, but there isn't. So the output's row12 would have the 3 only if it's generated by another transformation. Since there's no 2 in row12, it's not generated. So row12, col11 is 0.\n\nPutting all this together, the output should have:\n\n- Row3: [3, 0, ..., 3,2,3, ...] in columns 10,11,12.\n- Row6: [7, 0, 0, 0,7,1,7, ..., 0,7]\n- Rows5 and7, col5: 7s.\n- Rows2 and4, col11: 3s.\n\nNow, let's structure this into the 15x15 grid.\n\nBut the output should be formatted as the training examples. For example, in Example0's output, the 3s around the 2 are in the same row and adjacent columns, and the 7s around the 1 are in the same row and adjacent columns. So for the test input's 2 at row3, col11, the 3s would be in row3, columns10 and12, and rows2 and4, col11.\n\nSimilarly, the 1 at row6, col5 would have 7s at row6, col4 and6, and rows5 and7, col5.\n\nNow, putting this into the output:\n\nRow3: 3 in column0 (original input), then zeros until column10: 3, then 2, then 3. So:\n\n[3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,3,0,0]\n\nBut wait, the input row3 is [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]. So the transformation adds 3s in columns10 and12, and rows2 and4, column11.\n\nSo row3 in output becomes:\n\n[3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,3,0,0]\n\nRows2 and4, column11: 3s. So row2 is all zeros except column11:3.\n\nRow4, column11:3.\n\nFor the 1 in row6, col5:\n\nRow6: [7,0,0,0,7,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7]\n\nBecause original row6 has 7s in col0 and14. The 1's transformation adds 7s in col4,6, and rows5 and7, col5.\n\nSo row5, col5:7.\n\nRow7, col5:7.\n\nOther rows are mostly zeros unless affected by other transformations.\n\nAlso, the 3 from row0, col11 would move to row3, col11, but there's a 2 there, so it's not placed. Hence, row3, col0 is 3 (original input) and other transformations are from the 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the output should be:\n\nRows:\n\nRow0: all zeros.\n\nRow1: all zeros.\n\nRow2: [0,0,...,3 at col11, ...]\n\nRow3: [3,0,...,3,2,3,...]\n\nRow4: [0,0,...,3 at col11, ...]\n\nRow5: [0,0,...,7 at col5, ...]\n\nRow6: [7,0,0,0,7,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7]\n\nRow7: [0,0,...,7 at col5, ...]\n\nRows8-14: mostly zeros, except possibly for the 7s in row6, col14 and any other transformations.\n\nBut according to the test input, there's a 7 in row6, col14 (original input) which would remain as is.\n\nBut also, the 7 in row6, col14 is part of the input and not part of any transformation, so it stays.\n\nSo the final output would look like:\n\nFor example, row6 would be [7,0,0,0,7,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7]\n\nRow3 would be [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,...,3 at col11]\n\nRow4: [0,0,...,3 at col11]\n\nRow5: [0,0,...,7 at col5]\n\nRow7: [0,0,...,7 at col5]\n\nOther rows are zeros, except row6's 7s in col0 and14.\n\nNow, check the test input's row12 has a 3 in col11. According to the movement rule, it's moved to row15 (invalid), so it's omitted. Hence, row12 in output is all zeros, except if there's another transformation. The input's row12 has a 3 in col11, but no nearby numbers to generate transformations. So row12 would be all zeros.\n\nPutting all together, the output should be as described.",
