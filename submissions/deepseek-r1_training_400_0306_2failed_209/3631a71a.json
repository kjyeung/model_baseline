        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern in the given training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by looking at the examples provided to understand what transformation is happening from input to output.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input has several arrays, and the output seems to be a rearrangement. One thing I notice is that in the input, there are sequences with 9s (like [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9] in some rows). In the output, those 9s are replaced with other numbers. For instance, in the input's 6th row of Example 0, the output replaces the ending 9s with [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Wait, but looking more closely, maybe the 9s are being replaced with elements from earlier in the array. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 6th row ends with [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9], and in the output, it's replaced with [0,0,0,3,0,0,7,0]. Hmm. Let me check the corresponding input row. The input row is:\n[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\nThe output row is:\n[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0]\nSo the 9s at the end are replaced with [0,0,0,3,0,0,7,0]. Wait, looking at the input, maybe the part before the 9s is mirrored or reversed. Let me see: The input's part before the 9s is [0,0,0,7,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,8,0,0,8,0,4,0,0]. The output after the 9s is [0,0,0,3,0,0,7,0]. Hmm, maybe the 9s are replaced with the reverse of some part of the array. Let me check the positions. The 9s start at position 22 (0-indexed). The output from 22 onward is [0,0,0,3,0,0,7,0]. Let's see the part before the 9s. If we take the elements from 0 to 21, maybe take the reverse of a certain segment. Alternatively, maybe the 9s are replaced with the elements from the beginning of the row but shifted or transformed.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the 9s in the input are acting as placeholders, and the output replaces them with elements from other parts of the array. For example, in Example 0, the input rows with 9s in the output have those 9s replaced with numbers that are present elsewhere in the input. Let's check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. For instance, in the input's first row, there's a sequence [9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0] in the input. The output replaces those 9s with [3,0,8,3,0]. Wait, looking at the input row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The 9s at positions 21-25 are replaced with [3,0,8,3,0], which seems to be the reverse of [3,8,0,3,0] from the start of the array. Wait, the input starts with 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,0,3,0... So maybe the 9s are replaced with elements from the beginning of the array but mirrored or in reverse order.\n\nAnother observation: In the output, whenever there's a sequence of 9s in the input, they are replaced by a portion of the input array that's mirrored. For example, in Example 0, the first row with 9s is in the test input row 5 (assuming rows are 0-indexed). Let me check that again.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a sequence of 9s in the input array, those 9s are replaced by a copy of another part of the array, possibly the part before the 9s but reversed or mirrored. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has several rows with 9s. For instance, the first input row of Example 2 is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,8,8,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,0,8,8,0,0,5,0,0,0]. The output is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,8,8,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,8,8,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Here, the 9s are replaced with [0,4,4,4], which are the reverse of the preceding 4,4,4. So the 9s are replaced by the reverse of the numbers before them. Wait, the part before the 9s in the input is 0,0,0. Then the 9s are replaced by 0,4,4,4. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers after the 9s are mirrored. Let's see: After the 9s in the input, there's 0,8,8,0,0,5, etc. The output replaces the 9s with 0,4,4,4, which might be from the 4,4,4 earlier in the input. So maybe the 9s are replaced with a copy of a previous sequence, possibly mirrored.\n\nAnother example from Example 2: input row 3 is [0,0,1,1,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,3,8,0,0,9,9,9,9,0,4,4,0,4,0,0,1,1]. The output is [0,0,1,1,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,3,8,0,0,8,3,0,0,0,4,4,0,4,0,0,1,1]. Here, the 9s are replaced with 8,3,0,0. The part before the 9s includes 0,3,8,0,0. Maybe reversing that part? 0,0,8,3,0 reversed would be 0,3,8,0,0, but the replacement is 8,3,0,0. Hmm, not exactly. Alternatively, maybe taking the elements before the 9s and copying them in reverse, but maybe truncating to the length of the 9s sequence. The 9s are four elements, so taking the last four elements before the 9s: 0,3,8,0,0. The last four before 9s are 8,0,0, but there's a 3 there. Wait, maybe it's the 3,8,0,0. Reversed would be 0,0,8,3. Which matches the replacement 8,3,0,0? Not exactly. Maybe I need to look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the 9s in the input are acting as a mask, and the output is replacing them with the elements from the same position but in a different row. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the entire array is a palindrome, and the 9s are in the middle, but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at the examples again, the key seems to be that sequences of 9s in the input are replaced by a portion of the array from earlier, but mirrored. For example, in Example 0's first input row:\n\nInput row: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]\n\nOutput row: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe 9s are replaced with [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Looking at the beginning of the input array, it starts with [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The replacement here is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0], which is similar but the 5 is replaced with 1. Hmm, not sure. Wait, maybe the part before the 9s is from index 0 to 21, and the 9s are at 22-29. The output replaces 22-29 with [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Looking at the input's first part, maybe the elements at positions 8-15: 1,0,0,7,0,7,0,0. Reversed? 0,0,7,0,7,0,0,1. No. Or perhaps the elements after the 9s are mirrored. But in the output, after replacement, there's 0,1, etc. Maybe it's taking elements from the beginning and mirroring them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 9s are replaced with the reverse of the elements before them. Let's see:\n\nIn the input row, before the 9s (positions 0-21): [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0]. If we reverse this, it's [0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,0]. But the replacement is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach: looking at the entire array structure. The input and output arrays have the same length (30 elements), so it's a transformation within each row. The key seems to be handling the 9s. Let's check the third example as well.\n\nIn Example 3's input, looking at a row with 9s:\n\nInput row: [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 1, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput row is the same as the input. Wait, no, looking at Example 3's input and output, the first row is the same in input and output. But other rows have 9s replaced. For example, the input row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Output row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So the 9s are replaced with [3,0,8,3,0], which are the numbers 3, 8, 0, 3 from earlier in the input. The input starts with 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,0,3,0. So maybe the 9s are replaced by the first few elements of the array, but in reverse order. The elements before the 9s are 0,3,8,0,3,0. Wait, the 9s start at position 21. The elements from positions 0-5 are [0,0,0,0,0,0], positions 7-10 are [3,8,0,3]. So maybe taking elements 7-10: 3,8,0,3 and reversing them to 3,0,8,3, which matches the replacement [3,0,8,3,0] but with an extra 0. Hmm, perhaps appending a zero. So the 9s here are replaced with the reverse of a certain segment from the input.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern seems to be that whenever there's a sequence of 9s in the input, those 9s are replaced by a reversed copy of a preceding part of the array. The exact segment length and position might vary, but the key is reversing a certain part before the 9s and replacing the 9s with that reversed segment.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's look at the test input rows. Each row is a list of 30 numbers. We need to process each row, identify sequences of 9s, and replace them with the reversed copy of the preceding part before the 9s.\n\nFor example, the third row in the test input is:\n\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 6, 6, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nLooking for 9s. The sequence starts at positions 0-6 (seven 9s), then again at positions 20-24 (five 9s). The output should replace each consecutive 9s with the reversed part before them.\n\nFirst 9s from 0-6: the part before them is nothing (since they start at 0). Wait, but that can't be. Maybe the 9s at the beginning are left as is? Wait, looking back at the examples, in Example 0's input, some rows start with 9s. For example, row 8 in Example 0's input is [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]. The output for this row is [6,6,5,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,5]. Wait, the 9s in positions 0-6 and 22-29 are replaced. The output starts with [6,6,5,5,...], which might be taken from another part of the input. Maybe the entire row is being transformed in a way that the 9s are replaced by mirroring another part of the array. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire array is mirrored except for the 9s. Let me check the input and output for row 8 in Example 0.\n\nInput row 8: [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]\n\nOutput row 8: [6,6,5,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,5]\n\nSo the output starts with [6,6,5,5,0,1,...], which is the same as the first row of the output in Example 0. Wait, the first input row in Example 0 is:\n\nINPUT: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,5,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,5,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWhich becomes the first output row. The output row 8 in Example 0 seems to have the same starting numbers as the first row. So perhaps the rows are being reordered or mirrored in some way. But this complicates things. Maybe the transformation involves some kind of symmetry or reflection of the array, and the 9s are replaced with parts of the array reflected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the entire array is reversed, except for the 9s, which are replaced by the reversed part. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to find a simpler pattern. Let's focus on the 9s. The commonality across all examples is that sequences of 9s in the input are replaced with other numbers in the output. So the main transformation is replacing 9s with certain values. The question is: which values?\n\nLooking at Example 0's first row where 9s are replaced:\n\nInput row (from Example 0, fifth row):\n[0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n\nOutput row:\n[0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe 9s are replaced with [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Looking at the beginning of the input row, the first elements are [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The replacement starts with 0, then 1. The 1 comes from position 8 in the input (value 1). So perhaps the 9s are replaced with a section from the beginning of the row, but shifted or transformed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 9s are replaced with the reverse of the non-9 part of the row. Let's take the part before the 9s (positions 0-21):\n\n[0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0]\n\nReversing this would start with [0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,0]. Then taking the first 8 elements (since there are 8 9s to replace) would be [0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0], but the output replacement is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 9s are replaced by the mirror image of the part before them. For example, if the part before the 9s is symmetric, then the 9s are replaced with the other half. Or if the array is a palindrome except for the 9s.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,5,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,5,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput is the same as input. This suggests that rows without 9s remain unchanged. So the transformation is only applied to rows that have 9s.\n\nIn Example 0, the fifth input row (index 5) has 9s at the end. The output row replaces those 9s with [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Looking at the input row's elements before the 9s, there's a 1 at position 8. Maybe the 9s are replaced with the elements from the start of the array, but a certain section.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 9s are replaced with the elements from the start of the array, mirrored. For example, in the fifth input row of Example 0, the first 8 elements are [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Reversed, this would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0]. But the replacement is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Not matching. However, the 1 is at position 8 in the input. Maybe it's taking the elements from position 8 onwards, but only a few.\n\nWait, the input row has a 1 at position 8. The replacement starts with 0,1. So maybe it's taking elements from around position 8 and reversing them. The elements around 8 are 1,0,0,7,0,7, etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0], which corresponds to the first elements of the input row, but with a 1 inserted. Maybe the 1 comes from the position where the 9s start. The 9s start at position 22. The input row has at position 22 a 9, but the output replaces it with 0. So that's not it.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's look for another pattern. In Example 1's first input row:\n\nInput: [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,3,3,1,0,8,0,0,8,0,1,3,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput is the same as input. No 9s here, so no change.\n\nAnother input row in Example 1:\n\nInput row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,8,3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe 9s are replaced with [3,0,8,3,0]. Looking at the input elements before the 9s: positions 0-20. The elements are [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. The part before the 9s ends with 0. The replacement is [3,0,8,3,0]. Hmm. These values appear in the input at positions 7 (3), 8 (8), 9 (0), 10 (3), etc. So perhaps the 9s are replaced with elements from positions 7-11: [3,8,0,3,0]. Reversed, that would be [0,3,0,8,3]. But the replacement is [3,0,8,3,0]. Not exactly reversed. Alternatively, maybe it's taking the elements from positions 7-10 (3,8,0,3) and appending a 0. Then the replacement is [3,8,0,3,0]. But the actual replacement is [3,0,8,3,0]. Hmm. That's different. So maybe it's a mirror of a certain segment.\n\nWait, perhaps the segment before the 9s is reversed. For example, the elements before the 9s are up to position 20: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. If we reverse this entire segment, it would start with [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,8,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But the replacement is [3,0,8,3,0]. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe the part from position 7 to 10 (3,8,0,3) is reversed to 3,0,8,3 and then a 0 is added. That would give 3,0,8,3,0, which matches the replacement. Yes! So in this case, the 9s are replaced by the reverse of a specific segment before them. The segment length is the same as the number of 9s. The number of 9s here is 5 (positions 21-25). So the segment before the 9s, starting from position 7, which is 3,8,0,3,0. Taking the first 5 elements from that segment (3,8,0,3,0), reversing them gives 0,3,0,8,3. But the replacement is [3,0,8,3,0]. Hmm, not exactly. Wait, maybe the segment is 5 elements before the 9s. Let's see: The 9s start at position 21. The 5 elements before that are positions 16-20: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0] up to position 20. Wait, positions 16-20 are [0,0,0,0,1] (assuming 0-based). No, perhaps I need to count correctly. Let me recheck the input row.\n\nInput row (Example 1, second row):\n\nIndices 0-20: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nSo the elements before the 9s (positions 0-20) are:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nThe 9s start at position 21. The number of 9s is 5. So we need to take 5 elements from before the 9s. Let's take the last 5 elements before the 9s: positions 16-20: [0,0,0,0,1]. Reversing them gives [1,0,0,0,0]. But the replacement is [3,0,8,3,0]. That doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe the first 5 elements of the row: [0,0,0,0,0], reversed would be [0,0,0,0,0], but the replacement is [3,0,8,3,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 9s are replaced by the first occurrence of a non-zero number before them. But in this case, the first non-zero is 3 at position 7. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the 9s are replaced with the reverse of a certain segment that is symmetrically placed in the array. For example, if the array is symmetric except for the 9s, then replacing the 9s with the mirrored part.\n\nIn Example 0's row 5, the input is:\n\n[0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe replacement here is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. This looks like the mirror of the start of the array. The array starts with [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0], and the replacement ends with [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]. Wait, not quite. But the 1 is from position 8. Maybe the mirror is around the center of the array. Let's see: the array length is 30. The center is between 14 and 15. The replacement starts at position 22. The mirror of position 8 (which has 1) would be position 30-8-1=21, but position 21 is 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 9s are replaced with the elements from the beginning of the array, but mirrored. For example, the first 8 elements are [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0], reversed would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0]. But the replacement is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to find a general rule based on the examples. The common pattern seems to be that sequences of 9s in the input are replaced by the reverse of a preceding segment of the same length as the 9s. For example, in Example 1's second row, there are 5 9s. The replacement is [3,0,8,3,0], which is the reverse of the segment [0,3,8,3,0] (from positions 9-13, which are 0,3,0,0,1). Not exactly. Alternatively, maybe the segment is from the beginning of the array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 9s are replaced by the reverse of the non-9 elements in the row. Let's try this.\n\nIn Example 0's row 5, the non-9 elements are the first 22 elements. Reversing them gives [0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,0]. The replacement for 8 9s would be the first 8 elements of this reversed list: [0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0]. But the actual replacement is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 9s are replaced by the reverse of the non-9 part of the array, but only up to the length of the 9s. So for the first example row with 8 9s, the non-9 part is 22 elements. Reversing the entire non-9 part and taking the first 8 elements.\n\nBut this approach doesn't seem to fit the examples. \n\nLet me think of another way. In the test input, there are several rows with 9s. For example, the third test input row is:\n\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 0, 6, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 6, 0, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\nThis row starts with seven 9s. According to the pattern observed in examples, these 9s should be replaced by the reverse of a preceding segment. But since the 9s are at the beginning, there's nothing before them. So perhaps leading 9s are left as is, or maybe replaced with the reverse of the part after the 9s. Let's check the part after the 9s: [8,0,6,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,7,7,6,0,8,0,1,1,0,2]. Reversing this segment and taking the first seven elements: [2,0,1,1,0,8,0]. But the expected output for this row would need to replace the 9s with this reversed segment. However, in the examples, leading 9s are sometimes replaced (like in Example 0's row 8). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 9s are replaced by the reverse of the part that comes after them. For example, in the third test input row, the part after the 9s is [8,0,6,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,7,7,6,0,8,0,1,1,0,2]. Reversing this entire part would give [2,0,1,1,0,8,0,6,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,7,7,6,0,8]. Taking the first seven elements of this reversed list: [2,0,1,1,0,8,0]. So the replacement for the seven 9s would be [2,0,1,1,0,8,0]. \n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to be certain. Another approach is to look at the test input and see if the output can be generated by replacing each sequence of 9s with the reverse of the non-9 elements in that row.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Example 0's row 5, the 9s are replaced with [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0], which is the reverse of the part of the array before the 9s but with some elements. But this doesn't fit a clear pattern.\n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that sequences of 9s are replaced by the reverse of the part of the array before the 9s, taking the same number of elements as the number of 9s. Let's test this with the test input.\n\nTake the third test input row:\n\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 0, 6, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 6, 0, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\nThe first seven elements are 9s. The part after is [8,0,6,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,7,7,6,0,8,0,1,1,0,2]. If the 9s are to be replaced by the reverse of the part before them, but there's nothing before them. So perhaps in this case, the 9s are replaced by the reverse of the part after them. Taking the first seven elements after the 9s: [8,0,6,7,7,0,0]. Reversed: [0,0,7,7,6,0,8]. So the replacement would be [0,0,7,7,6,0,8]. \n\nThen the output for this row would start with [0,0,7,7,6,0,8] followed by the rest of the elements as in the input.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's see another example. \n\nAnother row in the test input:\n\n[9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,0,8,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,1,1]\n\nHere, there are seven 9s at the start and five 9s at positions 20-24. For the first seven 9s, replace them with reverse of the part after (since nothing is before). The part after the seven 9s starts with 6,0,8,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,6,6,9... So taking the first seven elements after the 9s: [6,0,8,0,0,6,6]. Reversed: [6,6,0,0,8,0,6]. So the replacement would be [6,6,0,0,8,0,6], followed by the rest of the row. \n\nFor the five 9s at positions 20-24, the part before them is up to position 19: [6,0,8,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,6,6]. Wait, the row is:\n\nIndices 0-6: 9s.\n\n7:6\n\n8:0\n\n9:8\n\n10:0\n\n11:0\n\n12:6\n\n13:6\n\n14:0\n\n15:0\n\n16:0\n\n17:0\n\n18:6\n\n19:6\n\n20-24:9s\n\nSo the part before the 9s at 20-24 is from 7-19: [6,0,8,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,6,6]. The number of 9s is 5. So take the last 5 elements before the 9s: [0,0,6,6]. Wait, positions 15-19: [0,0,0,0,6,6]. So the last five elements before the 9s are [0,0,0,6,6]. Reversed: [6,6,0,0,0]. Replace the five 9s with this. So the 9s at 20-24 become [6,6,0,0,0].\n\nThen the row would become:\n\n[6,6,0,0,8,0,6,6,0,8,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach for each row in the test input. For each sequence of 9s in a row, replace them with the reverse of the preceding non-9 elements of the same length. If there are not enough elements before, take what's available or pad with zeros. \n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nThe test input has multiple rows. Let's process each row:\n\nFirst test row:\n\n[8, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 6, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 7, 7, 0, 7]\n\nThis row has no 9s, so output is the same.\n\nSecond test row:\n\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 7, 1, 1, 3, 3, 6, 6, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 1, 1, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\nNo 9s, output same.\n\nThird test row:\n\n[9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,0,6,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,7,7,6,0,8,0,1,1,0,2]\n\nFirst seven elements are 9s. Replace with reverse of the next seven elements after the 9s (since nothing before). Next seven elements are [8,0,6,7,7,0,0]. Reversed: [0,0,7,7,6,0,8]. So the first seven elements become [0,0,7,7,6,0,8]. The rest of the row remains as is, but there are more 9s at positions 20-24 (five 9s). The part before these 9s is up to index 19: [0,0,0,7,7,6,0,8,0,1,1,0,2]. Wait, no. After replacing the first seven 9s, the row becomes:\n\n[0,0,7,7,6,0,8,8,0,6,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,1,1,0,2]\n\nNow, the 9s are at positions 20-24. The part before them is the elements up to index 19: [0,0,7,7,6,0,8,8,0,6,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0]. We need to take the last five elements before the 9s: [6,6,0,0,0]. Reversed: [0,0,0,6,6]. So replace the five 9s with [0,0,0,6,6]. The row becomes:\n\n[0,0,7,7,6,0,8,8,0,6,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,1,1,0,2]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. However, looking at the training examples, sometimes the replacement for 9s is taken from the beginning or a specific part of the array. This approach might not be accurate, but given time constraints, I'll proceed.\n\nContinuing this for all test rows, replacing 9s with reversed preceding segments of the same length.\n\nAfter processing all rows, the final output should follow this pattern. However, given the complexity and time, I'll provide the transformed rows based on this assumption.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Looking at the training examples, especially the first one, I notice that the input and output arrays have the same elements but maybe reordered in some way. Let me compare the input and output of Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the last few elements of the first array are [..., 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]. In the output, those are replaced with other numbers. Wait, actually looking closer, some of the 9s are replaced. For instance, in the input's sixth array, the end is [9,9,...], but in the output, those 9s are replaced with other values. Hmm, maybe the 9s are placeholders and being transformed based on nearby elements?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is about reversing parts of the array or mirroring. Let's check the first array of Example 0. Input starts with [0,0,0,...6,6,5,5...] and the output is the same. Wait, the input and output for the first array are identical. But other arrays in Example 0's input and output differ. For example, the sixth input array in Example 0 ends with [9,9,9,9...], but the output replaces those with [0,0,1...]. So maybe when there's a sequence of 9s, they are replaced by another part of the array?\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input and output. In the second input array, there's a part with [9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0], and in the output, those 9s are replaced with [3,0,8,3,0]. That seems like they're taking elements from earlier in the array. Maybe the 9s are acting as a mask and being replaced by elements from another part of the array, perhaps mirrored or shifted.\n\nAnother observation: the outputs often have sequences that mirror parts of the input. For example, in Example 0, the input's second array ends with [5,6,6,0,0,5,0,0,0], and the output's corresponding array ends with [5,6,6,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Wait, no, actually in Example 0's second input array, the output's end is [0,5,6,6,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Wait, maybe the 9s are being replaced by elements from the beginning or another section. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each array in the input is split into two halves, and the second half is reversed or transformed. For example, in Example 0's first input array, the output is the same, which might mean that when there are no 9s, nothing changes. But when there are 9s, they are replaced by elements from the first half. For instance, in Example 0's sixth input array: the input ends with nine 9s, and the output replaces them with [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Looking at the start of that array, the initial elements are [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,7,0,...]. Maybe the 9s are replaced by the first part of the array up to where the 9s start. Let's check the indices. \n\nWait, the sixth input array in Example 0 has 30 elements. The 9s start at position 22 (index 21 maybe?), and in the output, those positions are filled with [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Let's check the first elements of that array: positions 0-21. The elements before the 9s are [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0]. Then the output's end is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0], which seems like taking elements from the beginning. The first elements are 0,5,0,0... but the output's end is 0,1,0,0... Hmm, maybe the 9s are replaced with the elements from the start of the array but shifted or mirrored.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 9s are replaced by a reversed version of the non-9 part. For example, if the non-9 part is length N, then the 9s are replaced by the reverse of that part. Let me check. In Example 0, the sixth input array's non-9 part is up to index 21 (22 elements?), then the 9s start. The output's 9s are replaced with [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The first part of the array is [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0]. Reversing these might not get that. Alternatively, maybe the 9s are replaced by elements from the start of the array, but mirrored. For instance, the 8 elements after the 9s could be the first 8 elements reversed. The first 8 elements are [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0], reversed would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0]. The output is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0], which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the 9s are replaced by the elements that are in the same position in the array but from another row. For example, in Example 0, the sixth input array has 9s starting at position 22. The sixth output array has those positions filled with [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Looking at the first array's position 22, which is 5, but that might not relate. Alternatively, maybe the 9s are replaced by elements from the corresponding position in the first array. But that seems inconsistent.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. For instance, the first input array ends with [9,9,9,9,0,8,8,0,0,5,0,0,0], but the output replaces the 9s with [0,4,4,4,0,8,8...]. Wait, the input's first array's non-9 part is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,8,8,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,0,8,8,0,0,5,0,0,0]. The output for this array is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,8,8,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,8,8,0,0,5,0,0,0]. So the 9s at positions 17-20 (assuming 0-based) are replaced with 0,4,4,4. The original elements before the 9s are 0,0,0. Maybe the 9s are replaced by the elements that were before them, but modified. Like the 9s are replaced by the same elements as the ones before, but perhaps mirrored or duplicated. In this case, the 9s are replaced by 0,4,4,4, which could be the 4s from the earlier part (positions 10-13: 4,4,4,0). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 9s are acting as a sort of mirror. Maybe the elements after the 9s are a mirror of the elements before. Let me check. In Example 2's first input array, after replacing the 9s, the output becomes the same as the start. Wait, the first input array ends with 9s followed by 0,8,8..., and the output replaces the 9s with 0,4,4,4. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking for symmetry. For example, in Example 0's input, the first array is symmetric. Let me check. The first array is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,5,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,5,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The first half is up to index 14 (element 0), and the second half mirrors it. For example, positions 8-9 are 6,6, and positions 22-23 are 6,6. Similarly, positions 10-11 are 5,5, and 20-21 are 5,5. The middle part is 0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0. So the output is the same as the input here, which is symmetric. But other arrays in the input aren't symmetric, but their outputs are. For instance, in Example 0's second input array, the output's second array ends with 5,6,6,0,0,5, etc. So maybe the transformation is to make the array symmetric by mirroring the first half into the second half, but replacing 9s with the mirrored elements.\n\nBut how do the 9s fit in? Let's look at Example 1's first input array. The input starts with [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,3,3,1,0,8,0,0,8,0,1,3,3,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is the same. The second input array in Example 1 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0]. The output replaces the 9s with [3,0,8,3,0], which are the elements from positions 7-11 (3,8,0,3,0). So the 9s are replaced by elements from earlier in the array. So the pattern could be that sequences of 9s are replaced by a copy of elements from the beginning of the array, perhaps the same length as the 9s.\n\nTesting this hypothesis: In Example 0's sixth input array, the 9s start at position 22 (index 21) and continue for 8 elements. The output replaces them with [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0], which are the first 8 elements of the array: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But wait, the first 8 elements are 0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0. The output has 0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 9s are replaced by elements from the start of the array, but shifted by some amount. For Example 1's second input array, the 9s are replaced by [3,0,8,3,0]. The original array starts with [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,...]. The elements before the 9s are up to index 20: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. The 9s start at index 21. The output replaces the five 9s with [3,0,8,3,0]. Looking at the elements at positions 7,8,9,10,11: 3,8,0,3,0. So the 9s are replaced by the elements from positions 7-11. That's exactly the same as the elements right before the 9s. So in this case, the 9s are replaced by the preceding five elements.\n\nLet me check another example. In Example 2's first input array, the 9s start at position 17 (assuming 0-based) and are four 9s. The output replaces them with 0,4,4,4. Looking at the elements before the 9s: positions 16-19 are 0,0,0,9. Wait, no. The input array is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,8,8,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,0,8,8,0,0,5,0,0,0]. The 9s are at positions 17-20. The elements before that are positions 14-16: 0,0,0. But the output replaces the four 9s with 0,4,4,4. Hmm, maybe it's taking from earlier elements. The elements at positions 10-13 are 4,4,4,0. So taking those and truncating to four elements: 4,4,4,0. But the output is 0,4,4,4. Not matching. Or maybe reversed: 0,4,4,4. The elements before 9s include 0,0,0, then 9s. Maybe the replacement is 0 followed by the previous 3 elements? Not sure.\n\nAnother example: Example 3's input arrays. Let's take the first input array of Example 3. The input starts with [0,0,0,1,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,6,3,3,0,2,2,0,3,3,6,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,1,0]. The output is the same. Then in the sixth input array of Example 3, there are 9s at the end. The output replaces those 9s with elements from the start. For example, the input sixth array ends with [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9], and the output replaces them with [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0]. Wait, no. Wait the sixth input array in Example 3's input is [6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 7, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0]. The output is [6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 7, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0]. Here, the 9s at positions 9-11 are replaced with 2,7,7. Looking at the elements before the 9s: positions 0-8 are [6,0,0,0,6,0,2,0,0]. The replaced 9s are three in number, and replaced with 2,7,7. Wait, the elements after the 9s in the input are 1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,7,7,2, etc. Maybe the 9s are replaced by elements that come after them in the array? Or perhaps a mirror. Alternatively, in the output, the 9s are replaced with elements from earlier in the array. For example, the 2,7,7 could be from the elements at positions 6,7,8 (2,0,0). That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 9s are replaced by a copy of a segment from the same array, but not sure where. It's possible that the 9s are replaced by the elements from the same array but mirrored around the center. For instance, in Example 0's sixth input array, the 9s start at position 22. The array has 30 elements, so position 22 is towards the end. Mirroring around the center would mean that the elements after position 14 (middle) are mirrored. But the output replaces the 9s with elements from the start. Maybe the 9s are replaced by the elements from the beginning of the array, up to the same length as the number of 9s.\n\nAlternatively, the 9s are replaced by the elements that are mirrored from the left side. For example, in Example 1's second input array, the 9s are at positions 21-25 (five 9s), and the replacement is elements from positions 7-11 (3,8,0,3,0). So maybe the 9s are replaced by elements from the same array starting at position 7, length 5. That seems like a possible pattern.\n\nAnother example: Example 2's first input array has four 9s. The output replaces them with 0,4,4,4. The elements before the 9s are 0,0,0, then 9s. The 0,4,4,4 could be from positions 10-13 (4,4,4,0). Taking the first three elements (4,4,4) and prepending a 0? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 9s are replaced by the elements from the beginning of the array, but shifted by the position of the first 9. For example, in Example 1's second input array, the first 9 is at position 21. If we take elements starting from position 21 - some offset. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: The 9s in the input are replaced with a segment from the same array, but possibly mirrored. For instance, in Example 0's sixth input array, the 9s start at index 22 and go to 29 (8 elements). The output replaces them with [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Looking at the beginning of the array, the first 8 elements are [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output's replacement is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Where does the 1 come from? The 9th element is 1 (index 8). So maybe it's taking elements from the array before the 9s, but in a different order. For example, taking elements 8-15 (1,0,0,7,0,7,0,0) but reversed or something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 9s are replaced by a portion of the array that is not 9s, starting from the beginning, but the exact portion varies. It's possible that the 9s are replaced by the elements that appear earlier in the array, but the exact pattern depends on the position. For example, the number of 9s to replace is matched by taking the same number of elements from a certain position.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let me look for a different pattern. Another thing to notice is that in the training examples, the output arrays are permutations or transformations of the input arrays. For instance, in Example 0, the input and output arrays are the same except for the 9s. So the main pattern is that whenever there are 9s in the input array, they are replaced with other numbers, possibly taken from another part of the same array.\n\nSo the key is to identify where the 9s are and replace them with the elements from the start of the array, possibly in reverse order or some other transformation. For example, in Example 1's second input array, the 9s are replaced by elements from positions 7-11. So the replacement starts at position 7, takes 5 elements (same as the number of 9s). \n\nTesting this hypothesis with other examples: In Example 2's first input array, there are four 9s. The elements before the 9s are up to position 16 (element 0). So if we take four elements starting from position 12 (which is 4), then we get 4,4,4,0. The output replaces the 9s with 0,4,4,4. So it's the same elements but reversed. Because 4,4,4,0 reversed is 0,4,4,4. So the 9s are replaced by the reverse of a preceding segment of the same length.\n\nSo the pattern could be: For each sequence of 9s in the input array, replace them with the reverse of the preceding 'n' elements, where 'n' is the number of 9s in the sequence.\n\nLet's check this:\n\nIn Example 1's second input array, there are five 9s. The preceding five elements are positions 16-20: [1,0,0,0,0]. Reversed, that's [0,0,0,0,1]. But the output replaces the 9s with [3,0,8,3,0]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother possibility: The 9s are replaced by the elements from the start of the array, but mirrored. For example, in Example 0's sixth input array, the first 8 elements are [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The replacement for 8 9s is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 1 here is from index 8. So maybe the 9s are replaced by elements starting from the beginning, but with some offset. For example, starting from index 8 (element 1) for the first replacement, then 0,0, etc.\n\nAlternatively, the 9s are replaced by the elements from the array's non-9 part, but in reverse order. For instance, take all non-9 elements, reverse them, and replace the 9s with this reversed list. But that seems unlikely as the lengths would need to match.\n\nWait, in Example 0's sixth input array, the non-9 part is 22 elements, and the 9s are 8 elements. So reversing the 22 elements would give 22 elements, but we need 8 to replace the 9s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 9s are replaced by the first 'n' elements of the array, where 'n' is the number of 9s. For Example 0's sixth array, 8 9s are replaced by the first 8 elements: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But the output is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Let's try to think of another angle. Maybe the 9s are replaced by elements from the same array but from the corresponding positions in a different row. For example, in Example 0, each array is transformed into another array, possibly mirrored. But looking at the first and last arrays in Example 0's input and output, they are the same. The middle arrays seem to have their 9s replaced with elements from other parts. But how?\n\nAnother observation: In the training examples, the outputs are permutations of the input arrays, but with the 9s replaced. So the task is to find, for each array in the input, where the 9s are and replace them with specific elements from the same array. The key is determining which elements to use for replacement.\n\nLooking at Example 0's sixth input array again:\n\nInput: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]\nOutput: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe 9s start at position 22. The replacement elements are [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Looking at the array, the elements before the 9s are up to position 21: the elements are [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0]. The replacement starts with 0,1, which are the elements at positions 0 and 8. Then followed by zeros. So maybe the 9s are replaced by the first element, then the eighth element, then the rest zeros? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is the elements from the array before the 9s, but starting from the position where the first 9 is minus the number of 9s. For example, if there are 8 9s starting at position 22, then take elements from position 22-8=14 to 22-1=21. So positions 14-21: [0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0]. Reversed, this would be [0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0], which doesn't match the output [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nAlternatively, the number of 9s is N, and you take the first N elements after the last non-9 element. In Example 0's sixth array, after the 9s start, the last non-9 is at position 21 (element 0). The first N=8 elements after that are the 9s themselves, which doesn't help.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the test input provided. Let's look at the test input arrays to see if there are 9s and think about how to replace them.\n\nThe test input has several arrays with 9s. For example, the third array is [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,0,6,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,7,7,6,0,8,0,1,1,0,2]. The output for this would need to replace the 9s. How?\n\nIf the pattern is that 9s are replaced by elements from the same array's non-9 part, then in this array, the 9s are at the start (positions 0-6). So seven 9s. The non-9 part starts from position 7. The elements after the 9s are [8,0,6,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,7,7,6,0,8,0,1,1,0,2]. So replacing the seven 9s with the first seven elements after the 9s: [8,0,6,7,7,0,0]. But the output would then have these elements at the beginning. However, looking at the training examples, when 9s are in the middle, the replacement seems to take elements from before the 9s. So perhaps for leading 9s, the replacement is from after the 9s. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, when 9s are at the start, they are replaced by the elements that come after them. For example, in the third test array, the 9s are at the start, so replace them with the next seven elements: [8,0,6,7,7,0,0]. Then the remaining elements are [0,6,6,0,0,0,7,7,6,0,8,0,1,1,0,2]. But I'm not sure. This is getting too speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the possible patterns, I think the main rule is that whenever there are sequences of 9s in the input array, they are replaced by a copy of the elements from the start of the array, up to the number of 9s. For example, if there are 5 9s, take the first 5 elements of the array and replace the 9s with those elements. But looking back at Example 1's second input array, which has 5 9s replaced by [3,0,8,3,0], which are elements starting from position 7 (elements 3,8,0,3,0). So that doesn't fit. So maybe it's a different position.\n\nAlternatively, the 9s are replaced by a segment that starts from the first occurrence of a certain number before the 9s. This is unclear.\n\nAnother possibility: The 9s are replaced by a mirror of the non-9 part of the array. For example, the array is split into two parts: non-9 and 9s. The 9s are replaced by the reverse of the non-9 part. But that may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the entire array is mirrored, and the 9s are replaced by the mirrored elements. For example, if the array is length 30, the first 15 elements are mirrored in the second 15 elements, but 9s are replaced by their mirrored counterparts. Let's check Example 0's sixth input array. The first 15 elements are [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,7,0]. The mirrored part would be [0,7,0,7,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0]. But the output's replaced 9s are [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the problem statement, the output for each training example is a rearrangement of the input array's elements, with the 9s replaced by other numbers. The key is that the outputs are permutations of the inputs but with 9s replaced. Therefore, the total count of each number (excluding 9s) should remain the same. So for each array, the sum of non-9 elements in input should match the sum in output. Let's check Example 0's sixth input and output.\n\nInput sixth array: Count of 9s is 8. The output sixth array has no 9s, but adds some numbers. Wait, but the output's sum would be sum of input elements minus 8*9 plus the sum of the replacement elements. However, this might not hold, but considering that the replacement elements are taken from the same array, it could balance.\n\nAlternatively, the 9s are replaced by elements from elsewhere in the same array. For example, in Example 0's sixth input array, the 8 9s are replaced by [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0], which includes a 1 and seven 0s. The original array has a 1 at position 8. So perhaps the 9s are replaced by elements from the array, but not sure which.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and the possible patterns, I think the most consistent rule is that sequences of 9s in the input are replaced by elements from the beginning of the array, up to the number of 9s. For example, if there are 5 9s, take the first 5 elements of the array and use them to replace the 9s. Let's test this:\n\nExample 1's second input array has 5 9s. The first five elements of the array are [0,0,0,0,0]. But the replacement is [3,0,8,3,0]. Doesn't match. So this is incorrect.\n\nAlternative hypothesis: The 9s are replaced by the elements immediately preceding them. For example, in Example 1's second input array, the 9s are preceded by elements [0,0,0,0,1,0,0, ...]. So taking the last few elements before the 9s. Let's see: the 9s start at position 21. The elements before are positions 16-20: [1,0,0,0,0]. Reversed, it's [0,0,0,0,1]. But the replacement is [3,0,8,3,0], which doesn't match.\n\nAnother pattern: The replacement for 9s is the first occurrence of a certain pattern. For example, in Example 0's sixth array, the replacement starts with 0,1, which are the first two non-zero elements. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is the elements that form a symmetric counterpart. For instance, in Example 0's sixth array, the 9s are at the end. The replacement is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0], which mirrors the start of the array. The array starts with 0,5,0,0, etc. The replacement is 0,1,0,0... which may not mirror but could be part of a larger symmetry.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to proceed, I'll hypothesize that the 9s are replaced by the elements from the start of the array, up to the number of 9s, but shifted by the position where the 9s start. For example, if the 9s start at position 22 and there are 8 of them, take elements from position 0 to 7 (the first 8 elements) and place them in the 9s' positions. \n\nApplying this to Example 0's sixth array: The first 8 elements are [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 9s are replaced with these elements. But the output replacement is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0], which doesn't match. So this is not correct.\n\nFinal approach: Given the examples, the 9s are replaced by a specific segment from the array. For instance, in Example 0's sixth array, the replacement is [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0], which corresponds to elements at positions 0,8, and the rest zeros. Position 0 is 0, position 8 is 1, and the rest are zeros. Perhaps the replacement for 9s is taking elements at positions 0,8,16, etc., depending on the number of 9s. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following approach for the test input:\n\nLooking at the test input's third array:\n\n[9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,0,6,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,7,7,6,0,8,0,1,1,0,2]\n\nThe 9s are at the first seven positions. The output should replace these with the elements from the array after the 9s, possibly the next seven elements. So the first seven elements after the 9s are 8,0,6,7,7,0,0. Replacing the 9s with these would give the start of the array as [8,0,6,7,7,0,0], followed by the rest. But I need to check if this matches any training example pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is the reverse of the elements after the 9s. The elements after the 9s are [8,0,6,7,7,0,0]. Reversed, it's [0,0,7,7,6,0,8]. So the first seven elements would be replaced by this reversed segment.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to apply the pattern where sequences of 9s are replaced by the elements from the beginning of the array, but mirrored or copied in some way. For the test input, each array with 9s should have those replaced with elements from earlier in the array, possibly mirrored.\n\nApplying this to the test input's third array, which has seven 9s at the beginning, the replacement would be the first seven elements of the array after the 9s. But since the 9s are at the beginning, maybe the replacement is the first seven elements after the 9s. So the test input's third array starts with seven 9s, followed by 8,0,6,7,7,0,0, etc. Replacing the 9s with 8,0,6,7,7,0,0 would make the start of the array [8,0,6,7,7,0,0,8,0,6,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,...], but I need to check if that fits any pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement for leading 9s is the elements that come after them. So the third array in the test input would have the 9s replaced by the next seven elements, which are 8,0,6,7,7,0,0. So the output array starts with these elements, followed by the rest. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the pattern observed in Example 1's second input array, where the 9s are replaced by elements from a preceding section, and apply that to the test input.\n\nFor each sequence of 9s in the test input, I'll look for a preceding section of the same length and use those elements to replace the 9s.\n\nFor example, in the test input's third array: nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine,8,0,6,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,7,7,6,0,8,0,1,1,0,2.\n\nThere are seven 9s at the start. Looking for a preceding section of seven elements before the 9s. But since the 9s are at the start, there are no elements before them. So maybe in this case, the 9s are replaced by the elements that come after them. Taking the first seven elements after the 9s: 8,0,6,7,7,0,0. Replacing the seven 9s with these. Thus, the start of the output array becomes [8,0,6,7,7,0,0,8,0,6,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,...].\n\nBut without more examples, this is a guess. However, given the test input and the examples, the best guess is that sequences of 9s are replaced by elements from earlier in the array, possibly the same number of elements before the 9s. If there are no elements before (like leading 9s), then perhaps replace with elements from after the 9s.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with this approach and generate the output for the test input accordingly.",
