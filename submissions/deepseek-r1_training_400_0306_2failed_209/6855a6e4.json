        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input is transformed into the output. Let me start by analyzing each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some 5s and 2s arranged in specific rows. The output seems to have moved some of the 5s. For instance, in the input, the first two rows have a single 5 each in the fifth position. In the output, those 5s are moved down to rows 5 and 6, same column. Also, the 5s in the input's row 13 (third from the bottom) are moved up to row 9. The 2s structures (like the square) remain the same. So maybe the 5s are moving towards the center or being rearranged around the 2s structure?\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 5s on the sides of the structure made of 2s. The output moves those 5s inward. For example, the 5s in the seventh and eighth rows (the ones on the edges) in the input are now placed in the middle columns in the output. It looks like the 5s are being pulled towards the center of the 2s structure.\n\nExample 2's input has 5s around a 2s shape that's more horizontal. The output shifts those 5s into positions adjacent to the 2s. Like the 5s in the input's fifth and sixth rows are moved to form a cross or something around the 2s.\n\nPutting this together, maybe the rule is that 5s in the input are moved to positions that form a symmetrical pattern around the 2s structure. The 2s structures remain unchanged, and the 5s are either rotated, mirrored, or placed in specific positions relative to the 2s.\n\nLooking at the Test Input now. The 2s form a horizontal line in rows 3 and 11 (the long 2s lines) and rows 4 and 10 (the hollow squares). The 5s are arranged in a sort of arrow shape in the first two rows and at the bottom. The output should move these 5s around the 2s structure. \n\nIn the test input's first row, there's a sequence of 5s in columns 5-7. Maybe these get shifted down. The bottom row has 5s spread out. Perhaps the 5s are being placed symmetrically around the 2s structure. For example, the 5s in the first two rows might move into positions surrounding the 2s in rows 3-4 and 10-11. The single 5 in row 13 (third from bottom) might move to the center near the 2s. The bottom row's 5s could form a pattern around the lower part of the 2s structure.\n\nWait, in the training examples, the 5s are often moved to positions that are symmetrical relative to the 2s. For example, in Example 0, the 5s in the top and bottom are moved to the middle rows around the 2s. Similarly, in Example 1, the 5s on the edges are moved inward towards the center of the 2s structure. So perhaps the 5s are being \"attracted\" towards the center of the 2s shapes, filling in the spaces around them in a symmetrical way.\n\nLooking at the Test Input's 2s: the horizontal lines are in rows 3 and 11 (the 2s forming a long line) and rows 4 and 10 (the hollow squares). The 5s need to be arranged around these. The 5s in the first two rows and the bottom two rows might be shifted towards the 2s. For instance, the top 5s could form a vertical line through the middle of the 2s structure, and the bottom ones could form a horizontal line below.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are rotated 180 degrees around the center of the 2s structure. Let me check the training examples again. In Example 0, the 5s from the top and bottom are moved to the middle. The output's 5s in rows 5 and 6 (middle) and row 9 (which is near the original bottom 5s) suggest a reflection. So perhaps the 5s are mirrored vertically around the center of the grid.\n\nBut the Test Input's grid is 15 rows. The center row is row 7 (0-indexed). So maybe the 5s are mirrored vertically across the center. Let's test this with Example 0. The input's first row has a 5 at position 4. The output's row 5 has a 5 at the same position. If the center is row 7, then row 0's mirror is row 14. But in Example 0's output, the 5s from rows 0 and 1 are moved to rows 5 and 6. That's not a direct mirror. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: the 2s structures are static. The 5s are moved to the positions that are in the same relative position to the 2s. For example, if the 2s form a square, the 5s are placed around it in a symmetrical fashion.\n\nIn Example 0, the 5s that were above and below the square are moved to the middle of the grid, perhaps filling the space between the two 2s squares. Similarly, in the Test Input, the 5s might be placed around the 2s in a way that fills the empty spaces symmetrically.\n\nAnother observation: in the outputs, the 5s are placed in positions where they form their own shapes, possibly adjacent to the 2s. For instance, in Example 1's output, the 5s form a diamond shape in the middle.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the 5s are in a cross pattern. Maybe the 5s are moved to the nearest empty spaces adjacent to the 2s structures. Or perhaps they form a pattern that is symmetrical with respect to the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation might involve rotating the 5s around the 2s structure. For example, in Example 0, the 5s in the top are moved down, and the ones at the bottom are moved up, creating a sort of vertical mirror around the 2s structure.\n\nLooking at the Test Input, the top has a horizontal line of three 5s (positions 5-7 in row 0) and a sort of arrow shape in row 1. The bottom has a horizontal line of five 5s in row 14. The output should move these 5s into positions that are symmetric with respect to the 2s structures. Since the 2s in the Test Input are in rows 3,4,10,11 (the long lines and the squares), perhaps the 5s are moved to the center area around these 2s.\n\nFor instance, the 5s from the top (rows 0 and 1) could be moved down to rows around the upper 2s structures, and the ones from the bottom (rows 13 and 14) moved up to the lower parts. The single 5 in row 13 (column 6) might be moved to the center line, perhaps.\n\nLooking at the Test Input's structure, the 2s form two horizontal lines (rows 3 and 11) and two squares (rows 4 and 10). The 5s in the input are mostly in the top and bottom. The output might have the 5s arranged around these 2s structures, perhaps forming a diamond or cross pattern in the middle.\n\nAnother angle: in Example 0, the 5s from the top rows (0 and 1) are moved to rows 5 and 6, which are the middle rows of the grid. Similarly, the 5s from the bottom (row 13) are moved to row 9. The grid is 15 rows, so the middle is row 7. So row 0 and 14 are mirrored around row 7. But in Example 0, the 5s from row 0 and 1 are moved to rows 5 and 6 (which are 5 below row 0, and 5 below row 1?), which is not exactly a mirror. Maybe a vertical shift towards the center.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s are moved into the area between the two 2s structures. In Example 0, the 2s are in rows 3-4 and 10-11, so between them is rows 5-9. The 5s from the top and bottom are placed in rows 5-6 and 9, filling that middle area.\n\nIn the Test Input, the 2s structures are in rows 3-4 and 10-11. The middle area is rows 5-9. The input's 5s are in rows 0-1 and 13-14. The output should move those 5s into the middle area. For example, the three 5s in row 0 (columns 5-7) could be shifted down to rows 5-7, perhaps. The arrow-shaped 5s in row 1 (columns 4-8) might become a vertical line in the middle. The bottom's 5 in row 13 (column 6) might move up to row 7 (the center), and the row 14's five 5s could form a horizontal line in the lower middle.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s from the top and bottom are combined in the middle. For instance, the three 5s from row 0 (columns 5-7) might form a vertical line in column 6, rows 5-7. The 5s from row 1 (columns 4,5,7,8) could form a cross around that vertical line. The bottom 5s (row 14, columns 4-8) could form a horizontal line in row 9, columns 4-8. The single 5 in row 13, column 6 could stay there or move to the center.\n\nWait, looking back at Example 1's input and output: the 5s were originally on the edges (rows 6-9, columns 13-14) and in the output, they are moved into the middle columns (columns 5-7). So maybe the 5s are moved towards the center columns (columns 5-9) regardless of their original position. \n\nIn the Test Input's first two rows, the 5s are in columns 5-7 (row 0) and columns 4-8 (row 1). The bottom rows have 5s in column 6 (row 13) and columns 4-8 (row 14). If the pattern is to move 5s into the central columns (5-9?), but centered around the 2s structures. \n\nAlternatively, the 5s are rotated 180 degrees. Let's check. In Example 0, the top 5s are moved down. If the grid is flipped vertically, row 0 would become row 14, but in the output, the 5s from row 0 are in row 5. So that doesn't fit. Maybe a partial rotation or reflection.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s are moved to the positions that are symmetrical relative to the 2s structure. For example, if the 2s form a square, the 5s are placed around it. Let's see in Example 0: the square is in rows 3-4 and 10-11. The 5s are placed in rows 5-6 and 9, which are adjacent to the squares. Similarly, in the Test Input, the squares are in rows 3-4 and 10-11. The 5s from the top (rows 0-1) would be moved to rows 5-6, and the ones from the bottom (rows 13-14) to rows 8-9. \n\nAnother possibility is that the 5s are shifted down by a certain number of rows. In Example 0, the 5s in row 0 are moved to row 5 (shift +5), row 1 to row 6 (shift +5). The 5s in row 13 are moved to row 9 (shift -4). So the shifting isn't consistent. But perhaps the shift is such that 5s from the top are moved down to the middle, and from the bottom moved up to the middle, creating a symmetrical placement around the 2s.\n\nPutting this together for the Test Input: the 5s in the top rows (0 and 1) should be moved down to the middle rows (around 5-7), and the ones in the bottom (13 and 14) moved up to rows 7-9. The single 5 in row 13, column 6 might move to the center (row 7, column 6). The 5s in row 14, columns 4-8 could form a horizontal line in row 9, columns 4-8. The top's 5s (rows 0 and 1) would form vertical lines or another horizontal line in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s form a diamond shape around the 2s. Let's imagine the 2s are arranged in a vertical line. Then the 5s could form a diamond around them. But the Test Input's 2s are more spread out. \n\nAnother angle: in each example, the output's 5s are placed in positions that are adjacent to the 2s structures but not overlapping. The 5s form a kind of frame or border around the 2s. \n\nIn Example 0's output, the 5s are in rows 5-6 and 9, which are between the two 2s structures. Maybe the 5s fill the empty space between the 2s structures. \n\nSo for the Test Input, between the two 2s structures (rows 3-4 and 10-11), the middle area is rows 5-9. The 5s from the top and bottom are moved into this area. The Test Input's top has 5s in rows 0 and 1, and the bottom in 13 and 14. Moving them into rows 5-9.\n\nLooking at the Test Input's 5s:\n\nRow 0: [5,5,5] at positions 5-7.\n\nRow 1: [5,5,0,5,5] at positions 4,5,7,8.\n\nRow 13: [5] at position 6.\n\nRow 14: [5,5,5,5,5] at positions 4-8.\n\nSo if we move these into rows 5-9:\n\nThe row 0's 5s (positions 5-7) could shift down to row 5, same columns.\n\nRow 1's 5s (positions 4,5,7,8) could become a cross in row 6: positions 4,5,7,8.\n\nRow 14's 5s (positions 4-8) could move up to row 9, same columns.\n\nRow 13's single 5 (position 6) could move to row 8, position 6.\n\nThis would create layers of 5s between the two 2s structures.\n\nLet me check if this matches the training examples. In Example 0, the 5s from the top (rows 0 and 1) are moved to rows 5 and 6, which is exactly shifting down by 5 rows. The 5s from row 13 (original row 13) are moved to row 9, which is shifting up by 4 rows. So the shift varies, but the idea is to place them in the middle area between the 2s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the 5s on the edges are moved into the middle columns (columns 5-7) in the same rows. So perhaps the 5s are shifted towards the center columns and middle rows.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\nRow 0's 5s (5-7) \u2192 row 5, same columns.\n\nRow 1's 5s (4,5,7,8) \u2192 row 6, same columns.\n\nRow 14's 5s (4-8) \u2192 row 9, same columns.\n\nRow 13's 5 (6) \u2192 row 8, column 6.\n\nThis would create:\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut also need to check if other 5s are present. But in the Test Input, the only other 5s are in rows 0,1,13,14. The output would have the 5s in rows 5,6,8,9. \n\nBut looking at the training examples, sometimes the 5s are merged. For example, in Example 1's input, there are 5s in rows 7 and 8 (columns 13-14) and in the output they are moved to columns 5-7. So the movement is towards the center columns.\n\nSo perhaps the Test Input's 5s are moved from the edges to the center columns (around 4-8) and middle rows (5-9). Also, the single 5 in row 13 (column 6) would move to row 7 (center row), column 6.\n\nWait, the grid is 15 rows. The center row is row 7 (0-indexed). So moving row 13's 5 (row 13) to row 7 would be shifting up by 6 rows. But in Example 0, the row 13's 5 moved to row 9 (shift up by 4 rows). Hmm. Not sure. Maybe it's aligned with the 2s structure. In Example 0, the 2s are in rows 3-4 and 10-11. The middle of those is row 7. So moving the 5s to the middle area. For Test Input, the 2s are in rows 3-4 and 10-11, so the middle area is rows 5-9. So the 5s from top (0-1) and bottom (13-14) are moved into rows 5-9.\n\nSo in the Test Input's output, the 5s from row 0 (columns 5-7) would be in row 5, same columns. Row 1's 5s (columns 4,5,7,8) would be in row 6. Row 14's 5s (columns 4-8) would be in row 9. Row 13's 5 (column 6) would be in row 8, column 6.\n\nThis would create a vertical line of 5s in column 6 (rows 5,6,8,9) and horizontal lines in rows 5 (columns 5-7), row 6 (columns 4-8), row 9 (columns 4-8). But maybe overlapping.\n\nWait, row 5 would have 5s in 5-7, row 6 in 4,5,7,8. That could form a sort of cross. Then row 8 has a single 5 in column 6, and row 9 has a horizontal line from 4-8. That might form a diamond shape when combined.\n\nAlternatively, considering the movement as shifting top 5s down by 5 rows (row 0\u21925, row1\u21926) and bottom 5s up by 5 rows (row14\u21929, row13\u21928). Since 0+5=5, 1+5=6, 14-5=9, 13-5=8. That seems consistent. So:\n\nRow 0's 5s (columns 5-7) \u2192 row 5.\n\nRow 1's 5s (columns 4,5,7,8) \u2192 row 6.\n\nRow 13's 5 (column 6) \u2192 row 8 (13-5=8).\n\nRow14's 5s (columns4-8) \u2192 row9 (14-5=9).\n\nThis would create:\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis seems plausible. Now, checking the training examples to see if this shift applies. \n\nIn Example 0, the top rows (0 and 1) have 5s. In the output, they are in rows 5 and 6 (0+5=5, 1+5=6). The bottom row (13) has 5s moved to row9 (13-4=9, but 13-5=8). Wait, in Example 0's input, row13 has 5s. In output, row9 has them. 13-4=9. Hmm, maybe it's not a consistent shift. So perhaps the shift is 5 for top and 4 for bottom. Not sure. But in the Test Input, the shift of 5 for top and 5 for bottom would work, given that row14-5=9, which is the lower part of the middle area. \n\nAlternatively, the shift could be based on the position relative to the 2s structures. For instance, in Example 0, the 2s are in rows3-4 and 10-11. The middle between them is rows5-9. So moving the top 5s down to rows5-6 and the bottom 5s up to rows9.\n\nApplying that logic to the Test Input, which has 2s in rows3-4 and 10-11. The middle area is rows5-9. So moving the top 5s (rows0-1) down to rows5-6, and the bottom 5s (rows13-14) up to rows8-9.\n\nSo:\n\nRow0 \u2192 row5\n\nRow1 \u2192 row6\n\nRow13 \u2192 row8\n\nRow14 \u2192 row9\n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nSo the transformed Test Input would have 5s in rows5,6,8,9 with their respective columns. Let's see:\n\nRow5: Original row0's 5s at columns5-7 \u2192 row5, same columns.\n\nRow6: Original row1's 5s at columns4,5,7,8 \u2192 row6, same columns.\n\nRow8: Original row13's 5 at column6 \u2192 row8, column6.\n\nRow9: Original row14's 5s at columns4-8 \u2192 row9, same columns.\n\nThis would produce the following:\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,5,5,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nAnd the rest of the rows would be the same as the input except the original 5s are removed from rows0,1,13,14. The 2s structures remain unchanged.\n\nChecking the Test Input's structure, the 2s are in rows3,4,10,11. So the output's rows5-9 would have the 5s as described, while the 2s remain in their original rows.\n\nThis seems to fit the pattern observed in the training examples. Now, let's format the output accordingly.",
