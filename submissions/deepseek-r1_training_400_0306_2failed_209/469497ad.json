        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The goal is to figure out the transformation pattern from the input matrices to the output matrices in the training examples and then apply that to the test input. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the training examples to identify any common patterns. Let's start with Example 0. The input is a 5x5 matrix, and the output is a 10x10 matrix. So, the size seems to be doubling. Wait, 5x5 to 10x10? Let me check. Yes, each dimension is multiplied by 2. But maybe there's more to it than simple scaling.\n\nLooking at the content of Example 0's input and output. The input has a lot of 0s, 3s, and 8s. The output has 2s arranged in a diagonal pattern, then 8s in a block, then 3s. Let me see how the original positions map. For instance, the 8s in the input form a 2x2 block (positions (1,1) to (2,2)). In the output, this seems to expand into a 4x4 block (rows 2-5, columns 2-5). But wait, the output's 8s are in rows 2-5, columns 2-5, which is 4 rows and 4 columns. But the input's 8s are 2x2. So scaling each cell into a 2x2 block. So each cell in the input becomes a 2x2 block in the output. But the output matrix is 10x10, which is 5*2 in each dimension. So yes, each input cell is scaled up by a factor of 2. But then there's more. The 2s in the output form a diamond shape. How does that relate to the input?\n\nLooking at the input's first row [0,0,0,0,3], the output's first row starts with 2, then zeros, then 2 again, and ends with 3s. Wait, maybe the borders of the original matrix are being transformed into these diagonal 2s. The original input's corners might be the ones that generate the 2s. Wait, the original input's corners (0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4) in the input. But in the output, the 2s are placed in a diamond pattern. Hmm. Maybe the 2s are forming a border around the scaled-up matrix. Let's see. The 2s in the output for Example 0 are in the first and last two rows and columns, forming a diamond outline. Maybe each original 0 is being transformed into a diamond-shaped border when scaled up. Or perhaps the 0s in the input's outer regions are turned into a diamond pattern of 2s, while the non-zero numbers are expanded into blocks.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example, Example 1, the input is 5x5 again. The output is 15x15 (since the output for Example 1 has 15 rows and each row has 15 elements). Wait, wait, checking Example 1's output: the first row is a list of 15 elements, and there are 15 rows. So 5x5 input becomes 15x15 output. Wait, that's tripling the size. Wait, 5*3=15. So maybe the scaling factor depends on something else. Wait, but Example 0's input is 5x5, output is 10x10, which is doubling. Example 1's input is 5x5, output is 15x15. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again. Example 0's output has 10 rows. Each row in the output of Example 0 has 10 elements, so 10x10. The input is 5x5. So 5*2=10. Example 1's output is 15 rows, each with 15 elements, so 15x15. So 5*3=15. But the input is 5x5. So why the different scaling factors? That complicates things. So maybe the scaling factor isn't fixed but depends on some other aspect of the input.\n\nWait, looking at the test input. The test input is a 5x5 matrix. So perhaps each example's output size is determined by the input's elements. Let me check. Example 0's output is 10x10. The input has a 3 in the bottom row. The output has the last two rows filled with 3s. So maybe the scaling factor is determined by the maximum number in the input, but that doesn't fit. Example 0's max is 8 and 3. Wait, maybe the output rows are (original rows * 2) plus something. For example 0, original 5 rows, output 10 rows. 5*2=10. Example 1's output is 15 rows. 5*3=15. Example 2's input is 5x5, output is 20x20. Wait, Example 2's output has 20 rows. 5*4=20. So the scaling factor is increasing each time: 2, 3, 4. But why?\n\nLooking at the input elements. Example 0's input has 3 and 8. The output has 3s and 8s. Example 1's input has 4, 6, 7. The output has those numbers. Example 2 has 1,3,4,9. So maybe the scaling factor is based on the number of different non-zero elements. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, looking at the outputs, each non-zero block in the input is expanded into a larger block in the output. For example, in Example 0, the 8s in the input (a 2x2 block) become a 4x4 block in the output. Wait, 2x2 becomes 4x4, which is doubling each dimension. Similarly, the 3s in the last row of the input (5 elements) become two rows of 10 elements each (the last two rows of the output are all 3s). Wait, but 5 elements scaled by 2 would be 10, but the output rows are 10 elements. So maybe each row in the input is scaled vertically by 2 and horizontally by 2, but for some elements, but others have different scaling.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero element in the input is expanded into a square of size equal to their value. But that doesn't fit. For example, the 8s in Example 0's input are in 2x2 positions, and in the output, they become 4x4. So maybe each non-zero element's block is scaled by 2. But 3 is in the input's last row, and in the output, the last two rows (and the last column?) have 3s. Wait, maybe each non-zero number in the input is replaced by a square of size equal to the number. But 8 is a square of 4x4 (since 8/2=4?), but not sure. Alternatively, the scaling factors for different numbers vary. For example, in Example 0, the 3 in the last row is expanded into two rows (the last two) of 10 elements each. The 3 in the input's last row is repeated across the entire row in the output. Wait, the input's last row is [3,3,3,3,3]. The output's last two rows are all 3s. So each 3 in the input's row becomes two rows in the output, and each element is 3. So vertical scaling by 2. But horizontally, the 5 elements become 10, which is scaling by 2. So perhaps each cell is scaled by 2x2, but the non-zero cells are filled with their value, and zeros are transformed into some pattern (like the 2s forming a diamond).\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input has 0s in the first four rows except for the last element. The output's first eight rows have 2s arranged in a diamond pattern. Let me see: rows 0 and 7 of the output (assuming zero-based) start and end with 2. Then rows 1 and 6 have 2s further in. Then rows 2-5 have a block of 8s. The 2s form a diamond around the 8s. So perhaps the 0s in the input are transformed into a diamond-shaped border of 2s when scaled. But how does this relate to the original positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire input matrix is transformed by creating a border around each cell. For instance, each cell is expanded into a 2x2 block. Then, the 0s are replaced with a pattern where the borders of the expanded blocks are 2s. But that might not fit. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The input has 4s in the second and third rows. The output has 4s in a block of 6 rows (rows 3-8) and 6 columns (columns 0-5). So 6 rows and 6 columns. The original 4s are in two rows and two columns. So scaling by 3x3? Because 2 rows *3=6 rows. Similarly, the 7s in the first and second rows of the input's last column. In the output, the 7s are in the first three rows (0-2) of the last three columns (12-14). Wait, the input's last column has 7s in the first two rows and 6s in the next two. The output's last three columns (columns 12-14) have 7s in rows 0-8 and 6s in rows 9-11. So maybe each entry in the input's column is expanded into three rows. Wait, perhaps the scaling factors vary based on the value of the number. For example, 4 is expanded into 3 rows and 3 columns, 7 into 3 rows and 3 columns, etc. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number in the input is replaced by a square of size equal to the number. For instance, 8 becomes an 8x8 square, but that's not matching the examples. In Example 0, the 8s are in a 2x2 input block, which becomes a 4x4 output block. So 2x2 input becomes 4x4 output, which is doubling. But 8 is the value, and 8/2=4. Wait, maybe the size of the output block is half the value of the input number. But 8 becomes 4x4, 4 becomes 6x6 (in Example 1, 4s in input become 6 rows in output). Wait, no. In Example 1, the 4s are in two rows and two columns of the input. In the output, they occupy 6 rows (rows 3-8) and 6 columns (0-5). So 2*3=6. So scaling by 3. Similarly, the 7s in the input are in two rows, and in the output, they occupy 3 rows (0-2) in the last columns. So scaling factor of 3. So why scaling by 3 here? Maybe the scaling factor is determined by the sum of certain numbers or something else.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output dimensions: for Example 0, output is 10x10. The input's 3 is in the last row and column. The output's last two rows and last two columns are filled with 3s. So 5 input rows scaled by 2 gives 10 output rows. Similarly, Example 1's output is 15x15. 5*3=15. Example 2's output is 20x20. 5*4=20. So the scaling factors for the examples are 2,3,4. What's common in these examples? Let's see:\n\nExample 0: input has 3 and 8. The output scaling is 2. 3 and 8 sum to 11. Not sure.\n\nExample 1: input has 4,6,7. Sum is 17. Scaling 3. Hmm, not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the maximum value in the input. Example 0's max is 8. Example 1's max is 7. Example 2's max is 9. The scaling factors are 2,3,4. So 8\u21922, 7\u21923,9\u21924? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the scaling factor is the number of different non-zero elements. Example 0 has 3 and 8: 2 elements. Scaling factor 2. Example 1 has 4,6,7: 3 elements. Scaling 3. Example 2 has 1,3,4,9: 4 elements. Scaling 4. Oh! That makes sense. Because in Example 0, there are two distinct non-zero numbers (3 and 8), so scaling factor 2. In Example 1, three distinct numbers (4,6,7), scaling 3. Example 2 has four distinct numbers (1,3,4,9), scaling 4. Then the test input has numbers 0,6,8,1,7,9. Wait, the test input is:\n\n[0,6,6,0,8]\n[0,6,6,0,8]\n[0,0,0,0,1]\n[0,0,0,0,7]\n[8,8,1,7,9]\n\nThe non-zero numbers here are 6,8,1,7,9. That's five distinct numbers. So scaling factor would be 5. So the output should be 5*5=25 rows and columns. Wait, but the test input is 5x5, so if the scaling factor is 5, then output is 25x25. But that's a huge matrix. However, looking at the training examples, the scaling factor is the number of distinct non-zero elements. Let's verify:\n\nExample 0: non-zero elements are 3 and 8 \u2192 2 distinct \u2192 scaling 2 \u2192 output size 10x10 (5*2=10). Yes.\n\nExample 1: non-zero elements are 4,6,7 \u2192 3 \u2192 scaling 3 \u2192 output 15x15. Correct.\n\nExample 2: non-zero elements are 1,3,4,9 \u2192 4 \u2192 scaling 4 \u2192 output 20x20. Correct.\n\nSo for the test input, the distinct non-zero elements are 6,8,1,7,9 \u2192 five distinct numbers. So scaling factor 5. Output size 5*5=25 rows and columns. That seems to fit. Now, the next part is figuring out how each element is transformed into the output.\n\nLooking at the training examples, each non-zero element in the input is expanded into a square in the output. For example, in Example 0, the 3 in the last row and column becomes a 2x2 block (since scaling factor is 2) in the output. Wait, no. Let's think again. In Example 0, the input's last row is all 3s. In the output, the last two rows (each of 10 elements) are all 3s. So each 3 in the input's row becomes a row scaled vertically by 2. So each row in the input becomes scaling_factor rows in the output. Similarly, each column in the input becomes scaling_factor columns in the output. So the output is input_rows * scaling_factor rows and input_cols * scaling_factor columns.\n\nBut how are the values placed? For each cell (i,j) in the input, it's expanded into a block of size scaling_factor x scaling_factor in the output, filled with the input's value. But also, there's the diamond pattern of 2s in the 0 regions.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 8s in the input (positions (1,1) to (2,2)) are expanded into a 4x4 block (since scaling factor is 2). So each cell becomes 2x2. The 3s in the input's last row (each 3 in (4,0) to (4,4)) become 2x2 blocks in the output's last two rows and columns. Wait, the output's last two rows are all 3s, so each input row becomes two output rows. Each input column becomes two output columns. So for non-zero elements, their blocks are filled with their value, and 0s are filled with the diamond pattern of 2s.\n\nWait, but how does the diamond pattern form? For example, in Example 0, the 0s in the input's first four rows (except for the last element) are transformed into a diamond of 2s. The diamond seems to be a border around the expanded blocks of non-zero values. So perhaps the 0s in the input are transformed into a diamond-shaped border where the borders are made of 2s, and the inner parts are 0s. But how is the diamond positioned?\n\nAlternatively, the diamond pattern is created by placing 2s along the diagonals of the expanded matrix. For example, in Example 0's output, the first and last rows have 2s at the beginning and end. Then each subsequent row inward has the 2s moving closer to the center. This forms a diamond. The 8s are in the center of this diamond. So perhaps the 0 regions in the input are converted into a diamond-shaped frame of 2s, with the non-zero blocks placed inside.\n\nSo the transformation steps could be:\n\n1. Determine the scaling factor based on the number of distinct non-zero elements in the input. Scaling factor = number of distinct non-zero elements.\n\n2. Expand each input cell into a scaling_factor x scaling_factor block in the output. For non-zero cells, fill the block with the cell's value. For zero cells, create a diamond-shaped border of 2s, with 0s inside.\n\nBut how to determine the diamond's position and size. Let's look at Example 0 again. The input is 5x5, scaling factor 2, output 10x10. The diamond in the output is centered. The 8s are in the middle 4x4 block (rows 2-5, columns 2-5). The diamond of 2s surrounds this block. So the diamond is created by placing 2s along the lines where the distance from the center is a certain value. Alternatively, the diamond is formed by drawing lines diagonally and placing 2s along those lines.\n\nAlternatively, for each 0 in the input, when expanded into a scaling_factor x scaling_factor block, the border of this block is 2s, and the inner part is 0s. But in Example 0, the 0s in the input are expanded into 2x2 blocks. If the border is 2s, then each 0 in the input would become a 2x2 block with 2s around the edges and 0 in the center. But that's not what's happening in Example 0. Instead, the diamond pattern is a larger structure.\n\nAlternatively, the entire matrix is framed with a diamond made of 2s, and the non-zero elements are placed in their scaled-up blocks. So the diamond is a background pattern that's filled in around the non-zero blocks. For example, in Example 0, the non-zero blocks (8s and 3s) are placed over the diamond pattern of 2s and 0s. But how are the 2s and 0s arranged in the diamond?\n\nLooking at the first few rows of Example 0's output:\n\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3]\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 3]\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 3]\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3]\n\nThe 2s form a diamond shape around the central 8s. The diamond's outline is such that in the first row, the 2s are at positions 0 and 7 (assuming 0-based), then next row at 1 and 6, and so on until the middle rows where the 8s start. So this diamond is formed by placing 2s at positions (i, j) where |i - center_row| + |j - center_col| \u2264 some value. The center of the diamond is where the 8s are located.\n\nBut how does this relate to the input? The input's 8s are in a 2x2 block. In the output, they are in a 4x4 block (since scaling factor is 2). The diamond of 2s surrounds this block. So perhaps the diamond's size is determined by the scaling factor.\n\nAlternatively, the diamond is formed by expanding each 0 in the input into a diamond pattern of 2s and 0s. But this seems complex.\n\nAnother approach: The output is created by first expanding each input cell into a scaling_factor x scaling_factor block. For non-zero cells, fill the block with the value. For zero cells, fill the block with a diamond pattern of 2s on the borders and 0s inside. But how?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the scaling factor is 2, so each input cell becomes 2x2. For a zero cell, the corresponding 2x2 block in the output is filled with 2s in a diamond pattern. For example, the top-left zero in the input becomes a 2x2 block in the output. The first row of the output's first two cells are [2,0] and [0,2] perhaps. But looking at the actual Example 0 output, the first row starts with [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,...]. So the first 8 elements (columns 0-7) of the first row are 2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2. The next two columns are 3,3. So for the first input row's first four zeros (positions 0-3), each is scaled into 2x2 blocks. Let's see: input row 0 is [0,0,0,0,3]. The first four zeros would become 4 cells in the input (each 0 scaled to 2x2), but in the output, the first eight columns (scaling factor 2, 4 columns \u2192 8 columns) are part of the 0s. The output's first row for these columns is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. So perhaps for each zero cell in the input, when expanded into scaling_factor x scaling_factor blocks, they form part of a larger diamond pattern. \n\nAlternatively, the entire expanded matrix (after scaling) has a diamond pattern of 2s, and the non-zero blocks are overlaid on top. For instance, in Example 0, after expanding all input cells into 2x2 blocks (10x10), the diamond of 2s is drawn, and then the non-zero blocks (8s and 3s) are placed over their respective areas. \n\nSo the process could be:\n\n1. Determine the scaling factor (number of distinct non-zero elements in input).\n\n2. Create an output matrix of size (original rows * scaling factor) x (original columns * scaling factor).\n\n3. Fill the entire output matrix with a diamond pattern of 2s and 0s.\n\n4. Overwrite the areas corresponding to non-zero input cells with their respective values, expanded into scaling_factor x scaling_factor blocks.\n\nBut how is the diamond pattern generated? For Example 0's scaling factor 2, the diamond seems to have a certain width. Let's think of it as a diamond where the 2s are placed at positions where their distance from the center meets certain criteria.\n\nAlternatively, the diamond pattern is generated by creating a border that is scaling_factor layers thick. For example, in scaling factor 2, the diamond has two layers of 2s. But this is speculative.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps for Example 0:\n\nScaling factor is 2. The output is 10x10.\n\n- The diamond of 2s is formed by placing 2s along the diagonals at a certain distance. The first row has 2s at positions 0 and 7 (assuming 0-based), next row 1 and 6, etc. So the diamond's width increases until the middle rows (rows 2-5), which are filled with 8s. Then the 2s decrease again. So the diamond is symmetric.\n\n- The 8s are placed in the central 4x4 block, which corresponds to the input's 2x2 block of 8s scaled by 2.\n\n- The 3s are placed in the last two columns (scaling factor 2 for the input's last column, which has 3s in all rows except the first two). Wait, no. The input's last column (index 4) has 3s in rows 0-3 and 3 in row 4. So scaled by 2, each 3 in the input's last column becomes two columns in the output. So the last two columns of the output (columns 8-9) are filled with 3s. And the last two rows (rows 8-9) are also filled with 3s. So the input's last row (all 3s) becomes two rows in the output, filled with 3s.\n\nBut the output's last two rows are completely filled with 3s, not just the last two columns. So perhaps the input's last row (all 3s) is expanded into two rows in the output, each of 10 elements. Similarly, the last column of the input (which has 3s in the first four rows and 3 in the fifth) is expanded into two columns in the output. But the output's last two columns are 3s in all rows. So maybe the last row and column are treated differently. Or perhaps the entire last row and last column are filled with their respective values in the output.\n\nWait, the input's last row is [3,3,3,3,3]. So each cell in this row is a 3. When expanded by scaling factor 2, each 3 becomes a 2x2 block of 3s. So the last two rows of the output would be filled with 3s. Similarly, the last column of the input has 3s in the first four rows (rows 0-3) and a 3 in row 4. When scaled by 2, each becomes 2 columns. So columns 8-9 in the output are filled with 3s. But in the output, the last two columns (8-9) are 3s in all rows. That suggests that the entire last column of the input is filled with 3s, which isn't the case. Only row 4 in the input's last column is 3. Wait, no. The input's last column (index 4) has:\n\nRow 0: 3\n\nRow 1: 3\n\nRow 2: 3\n\nRow 3: 3\n\nRow 4:3\n\nSo all rows have 3 in the last column. So scaling factor 2, each 3 in the last column becomes two columns. So columns 8-9 in the output are filled with 3s for all rows. That makes sense.\n\nSo the process seems to be:\n\n- Each cell in the input is expanded into a scaling_factor x scaling_factor block in the output. For non-zero cells, fill the block with the cell's value. For zero cells, the block is part of the diamond pattern of 2s and 0s.\n\nBut how to create the diamond pattern. Looking at Example 0's output, the diamond of 2s is formed around the central blocks. It seems that the diamond is a frame that exists in the areas corresponding to the input's zero cells. So for each zero cell in the input, when expanded into a scaling_factor x scaling_factor block, the block is filled with 2s along its borders and 0s inside. Or perhaps the diamond is a larger structure that's drawn first, and then the non-zero blocks are placed on top.\n\nAlternatively, the diamond is created by checking the Manhattan distance from the center of the output matrix. For each position (i,j) in the output, if the Manhattan distance to the center is within a certain range, place a 2; otherwise, 0. But this may vary based on the scaling factor.\n\nAlternatively, the diamond is formed by creating a grid where for each row in the output, the 2s are placed at positions that are a certain distance from the center row and column. For Example 0, scaling factor 2:\n\nThe diamond's pattern in the output's first few rows:\n\nRow 0: 2 at positions 0 and 7 (0-based), rest 0.\n\nRow 1: 2 at 1 and 6.\n\nRow 2: 2 at 2 and 5 (but in Example 0's output, rows 2-5 have 8s instead). Wait, no. The 8s are in the central 4x4 block. So maybe the diamond is only present in the zero regions, and the non-zero blocks overwrite parts of the diamond.\n\nSo perhaps the diamond is a background layer, and the non-zero blocks are placed on top.\n\nPutting this all together, the steps are:\n\n1. Determine the scaling factor (number of distinct non-zero elements in the input).\n\n2. Create an output matrix of size (original rows * scaling_factor) x (original columns * scaling_factor).\n\n3. Fill the output matrix with a diamond pattern of 2s and 0s. The diamond is formed such that the 2s are placed along lines where the sum of the row and column distances from the center is less than or equal to a certain value.\n\n4. For each non-zero cell in the input, expand it into a scaling_factor x scaling_factor block in the output, filled with the cell's value, overwriting the diamond pattern in that region.\n\n5. Additionally, for the last row and last column of the input, expand their cells into the corresponding rows and columns in the output, filled with their values. \n\nWait, but in Example 0's output, the last two rows and last two columns are filled with 3s. The last row of the input is all 3s, and the last column is all 3s. So expanding each 3 in the last row into two rows (scaling factor 2) filled with 3s, and each 3 in the last column into two columns filled with 3s. But in the output, the last two rows are entirely 3s, not just the last two columns. So perhaps the entire last row and last column of the input are expanded to fill the corresponding output regions, overwriting the diamond pattern.\n\nBut how? For example, in Example 0, the last row of the input is all 3s. When expanded into two rows in the output (rows 8 and 9), each of these rows is filled with 3s, regardless of their position in the diamond. Similarly, the last column of the input is all 3s. When expanded into two columns (columns 8 and 9), all rows in these columns are filled with 3s. This overwrites the diamond's 2s and 0s in those regions.\n\nSo the complete steps are:\n\n1. Determine the scaling factor (s) as the number of distinct non-zero elements in the input.\n\n2. Create the output matrix of size (5*s) x (5*s).\n\n3. Fill the entire output matrix with a diamond pattern of 2s and 0s. The diamond is formed such that in each row, the 2s are placed at positions that form a diamond shape around the center of the matrix.\n\n4. For each cell in the input matrix:\n\n   a. If the cell is non-zero, expand it into an s x s block in the output, filled with the cell's value. This overwrites the diamond pattern in that block.\n\n   b. Additionally, if the cell is in the last row or last column of the input, expand it into the corresponding rows or columns of the output, filling those entire rows or columns with the cell's value. For example, if the cell is in the last row of the input, all s rows in the output corresponding to this input row are filled with the cell's value. Similarly for the last column.\n\nThis explains why in Example 0, the last two rows (output rows 8-9) are filled with 3s, and the last two columns (output columns 8-9) are filled with 3s. Because the last row and last column of the input are all 3s, their expanded regions overwrite the diamond pattern in those areas.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,6,6,0,8]\n[0,6,6,0,8]\n[0,0,0,0,1]\n[0,0,0,0,7]\n[8,8,1,7,9]\n\nDistinct non-zero elements: 6,8,1,7,9 \u2192 5 distinct. So scaling factor s=5. Output size is 5*5=25 rows and columns.\n\nFirst, create a 25x25 matrix filled with a diamond pattern of 2s and 0s. Then, overlay the non-zero elements as per the input.\n\nNext, expand each non-zero cell into a 5x5 block filled with its value. Also, the last row and last column of the input will have their entire corresponding output rows and columns filled with their values.\n\nLet's break down the test input:\n\nInput rows are 5. Each input row will be expanded into 5 rows in the output.\n\nThe input has non-zero elements:\n\nRow 0: 6,6,8 (columns 1,2,4)\n\nRow 1: 6,6,8 (columns 1,2,4)\n\nRow 2: 1 (column 4)\n\nRow 3:7 (column4)\n\nRow4:8,8,1,7,9 (columns 0,1,2,3,4)\n\nSo, the non-zero elements are 6,8,1,7,9. Each of these will be expanded into 5x5 blocks.\n\nFor example, the 6s in row 0, columns 1 and 2. Each 6 in the input will be a 5x5 block of 6s in the output. Similarly for other numbers.\n\nAdditionally, the last row (row4) of the input is [8,8,1,7,9]. Each cell in this row will cause the corresponding 5 rows in the output (rows 20-24) to be filled with their respective values. For example, the first cell (8) will fill columns 0-4 of rows 20-24 with 8s. The next cell (8) will fill columns 5-9 with 8s, etc. Similarly, the last column (column4) of the input has 8,8,1,7,9. Each cell in this column will cause the corresponding 5 columns in the output (columns 20-24) to be filled with their respective values, for all rows.\n\nBut wait, the scaling factor is 5, so each input cell becomes 5x5 in the output. The last row of the input becomes the last 5 rows of the output. Each cell in the last row of the input is expanded into 5 columns and 5 rows. So for example, input cell (4,0) (8) becomes a 5x5 block in the output's last 5 rows and first 5 columns. Similarly, cell (4,4) (9) becomes a 5x5 block in the output's last 5 rows and last 5 columns. \n\nBut also, because it's the last row, the entire corresponding rows in the output are filled with the cell's value. So the input's last row cells are expanded both as 5x5 blocks and fill the entire corresponding rows. Similarly, the last column's cells fill the entire corresponding columns.\n\nThis might lead to overlapping. For example, the cell (4,4) in the input is 9. In the output, it would expand into a 5x5 block at rows 20-24 and columns 20-24. Additionally, since it's in the last row and last column, rows 20-24 would be filled with 9s, and columns 20-24 would be filled with 9s. But this would overwrite any other values in those rows and columns. However, according to the examples, the last row and column's expansion takes precedence.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nThe diamond pattern is created first. Then, each non-zero cell is expanded into a 5x5 block. Then, the last row and last column's expansions overwrite any existing values in their respective areas.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nThe output will be a 25x25 matrix. Let's think about the structure:\n\n1. Diamond pattern of 2s and 0s as the background.\n\n2. Overlay the non-zero blocks:\n\n   a. The 6s in rows 0 and 1, columns 1 and 2. Each becomes a 5x5 block of 6s. For example, input row 0, column 1 (6) becomes output rows 0-4, columns 5-9 (since scaling factor is 5: each input column is 5 output columns). Wait, input column 1 would start at output column 5*1=5 to 5*2-1=9. So for input cell (0,1) (6), the output block is rows 0-4 (since input row 0 is output rows 0-4) and columns 5-9. Similarly, input cell (0,2) (6) is output columns 10-14. So two 5x5 blocks of 6s in rows 0-4 and columns 5-14.\n\n   b. The 8s in rows 0 and 1, column4. Each becomes a 5x5 block of 8s. Input column4 is output columns 20-24. So rows 0-4, columns 20-24 are 8s.\n\n   c. The 1 in row2, column4: output rows 10-14 (input row2), columns 20-24. Block of 1s.\n\n   d. The 7 in row3, column4: output rows 15-19, columns 20-24. Block of 7s.\n\n   e. The last row (input row4):\n\n      i. Cell (4,0): 8 \u2192 output rows 20-24, columns 0-4.\n\n      ii. Cell (4,1):8 \u2192 output rows 20-24, columns5-9.\n\n      iii. Cell (4,2):1 \u2192 rows 20-24, columns10-14. Block of 1s.\n\n      iv. Cell (4,3):7 \u2192 rows 20-24, columns15-19. Block of 7s.\n\n      v. Cell (4,4):9 \u2192 rows20-24, columns20-24. Block of 9s.\n\nAdditionally, because the last row and column are expanded to fill their output rows and columns:\n\n- The last row (input row4) will have all corresponding output rows (20-24) filled with their respective values. For example, row20-24 in the output will have columns 0-4 as 8s (from cell (4,0)), columns5-9 as 8s (from cell (4,1)), columns10-14 as 1s, etc. But since each cell in the last row is expanded into 5 columns, this would fill the entire row with the corresponding values. So each input cell in the last row expands to 5 columns, so row20-24 in the output will have their entire rows filled with the values from input row4. For example, row20 will have columns 0-4:8, 5-9:8, 10-14:1, 15-19:7, 20-24:9. Similarly for rows 21-24.\n\n- The last column (input column4) will have all corresponding output columns (20-24) filled with their respective values. Each input cell in column4 is expanded into 5 rows. For example, input row0, column4 (8) becomes output columns20-24, rows0-4 filled with 8s. Input row1, column4 (8) becomes rows5-9. Row2, column4 (1) \u2192 rows10-14. Row3, column4 (7) \u2192 rows15-19. Row4, column4 (9) \u2192 rows20-24. So columns20-24 will have:\n\nRows 0-4: 8s\n\nRows5-9: 8s\n\nRows10-14:1s\n\nRows15-19:7s\n\nRows20-24:9s\n\nNow, combining all these, the diamond pattern of 2s will be present in the background except where overwritten by the non-zero blocks and the last row/column expansions.\n\nFinally, the test input's output should be a 25x25 matrix with:\n\n- A diamond pattern of 2s and 0s.\n\n- Blocks of 6s, 8s, 1s,7s,9s as per the input's non-zero cells.\n\n- The last five rows filled with 8s,8s,1s,7s,9s in their respective columns.\n\n- The last five columns filled with 8s,8s,1s,7s,9s in their respective rows.\n\nPutting this into the required format, the output would be a list of lists, each inner list representing a row. Due to the size (25x25), it's impractical to write all elements here, but the pattern would follow:\n\n- The first 20 rows (input rows 0-3 scaled by 5) would have the diamond pattern with overlaid blocks.\n\n- The last 5 rows (input row4) would each have the values 8,8,1,7,9 each expanded into 5 columns.\n\n- The last 5 columns (input column4) would have 8s for the first 10 rows, then 1s, 7s, and finally 9s.\n\nBut given the examples, the output also includes the diamond pattern's 2s in the regions not overwritten by the non-zero blocks. However, due to the complexity of generating the exact diamond pattern, the key points are:\n\n- Each non-zero cell is expanded into a 5x5 block.\n\n- The last row and column are filled with their respective values across all rows and columns.\n\n- The diamond pattern of 2s is present elsewhere.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input, the final output should resemble the training examples but scaled to 25x25 with the appropriate values.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 5x5 grid, and the output is a much larger grid. Let's see how they transform.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a lot of 0s, some 8s forming a square in the middle, and 3s on the edges. The output is a 10x10 grid. The first thing I notice is that the output has a diamond-like pattern with 2s on the edges, then the 8s expanded into a bigger rectangle, and then 3s filling the right and bottom parts. The size increased from 5x5 to 10x10, which is double each dimension. But maybe there's more to it.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input is again 5x5. The output here is a 15x15 grid. The output has a structure where there's a diagonal of 2s spreading outwards, then a block of 4s, then 7s and 6s on the right and bottom. The output's rows and columns are tripled? Wait, 5x5 input becomes 15x15, which is 3 times each. Hmm, but Example 0's input 5x5 to 10x10 would be 2 times. So maybe the scaling factor varies? Or perhaps it's based on the number of distinct elements or their positions.\n\nWait, let's check the dimensions. Example 0 output is 10x10, which is 5*2. Example 1's output is 15x15 (5*3), Example 2's output is 20x20 (5*4). So each example's output size is 5 multiplied by some number. Wait, Example 0's input has 3s, 8s, etc. Maybe the scaling factor is determined by the maximum value in the input? Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the maximum value is 8. 8 divided by 4 (since 5x5 input) is 2. So 5*2=10. Hmm, but 8 divided by something else? Maybe the maximum value plus 1? Not sure. Example 1's max is 7. 7+3=10? Not matching. Example 2's max is 9. 9+11=20? No. Alternatively, maybe the scaling factor is determined by the number of rows in the output. For example, in Example 0, the output is 10 rows. The input's last row is [3,3,3,3,3], which is all 3s. So perhaps the output's rows are the sum of the last row's elements multiplied by something. Wait, that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, looking at how the output is structured. For Example 0, the output has a diamond made of 2s, then a block of 8s, then 3s. The 2s seem to form a border that's diagonally placed. The 8s in the input are expanded into a larger rectangle. Similarly, in Example 1, the 4s are expanded into a larger block, and the 7s and 6s are on the right and bottom. The 2s form a sort of diagonal pattern again.\n\nWait, maybe each number in the input grid is transformed into a block in the output grid. For instance, in Example 0, the 8s in the input form a 4x4 block (since in the input it's a 2x2 block of 8s, and in the output it's 4 rows of 8s). So the scaling for each element depends on the position. For the 8s in the input, they become a larger block. The 3s in the input's last column and row are expanded into the last two columns and two rows of the output. The 2s form a diamond shape, which might be related to the 0s in the input's borders.\n\nAnother observation: The output seems to have several sections. The upper part has the 2s forming a diamond, then a middle section with the expanded blocks (like the 8s, 4s, etc.), and then the right and bottom sections with the numbers from the input's last column and row, respectively. Also, the last element of the input (the bottom-right corner) becomes the bottom-right corner of the output, but scaled up.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input. The last row is [9,9,3,3,4]. The output's last four rows are filled with 9s, then 3s, then 4s. Each of these is expanded into a block. For example, the 9s in the input's first column (in the last row) become a block of four rows (since the output's last four rows have 9s in the first part). The 3s and 4s are similarly expanded.\n\nSo perhaps the input is transformed by expanding each cell into a block whose size depends on the cell's value. But how? Wait, in Example 0, the input's 8s are in the middle. The output's middle section has 4 rows of 8s (rows 2-5). The input's 8s are in rows 1-2 (0-based?), so maybe each cell's value determines the size of the block. Wait, 8 is the value. But in Example 0, the 8s are expanded into 4 rows. 8/2=4. Example 1's 4s are expanded into 6 rows (rows 3-8 in the output). 4*1.5=6? Not sure. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output grid's size is determined by the sum of the values in the last row or last column. For example, in Example 0's last row is 3+3+3+3+3=15. But the output has 10 rows. Doesn't fit. Example 1's last row sums to 7+7+6+6+6=32. Output has 15 rows. 32/15 isn't an integer. So that might not be it.\n\nWait, perhaps the output grid is a combination of expanding each input cell into a certain number of rows and columns. For instance, each input cell's value determines how many rows or columns it contributes to the output. Let's take Example 0's input cell at (1,1) (assuming 0-based), which is 8. In the output, there's a block of 8s that's 4 rows tall. Maybe each value is divided by 2. 8/2=4. Similarly, in Example 1, the 4s in the input (value 4) are expanded into 4 rows. 4/1=4. But in Example 1's output, the 4s are in rows 3-8, which is 6 rows. Hmm, that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value determines the number of columns or rows. For example, in Example 0, the 8s are in a 2x2 block. The output's 8s are in a 4x4 block (each input cell becomes 2x2). So 8 might correspond to scaling by 2. But the 3s in Example 0's last row are in 5 cells, and the output's last two rows are all 3s. So each 3 in the input's last row becomes 2 rows. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers in the input are split into different regions. For example, the 8s in Example 0 form a square in the input, which is then expanded into a larger square in the output, and the 3s form the border. The 2s might be forming a border around the 8s. Wait, the 2s in Example 0's output form a diamond shape. The positions of the 2s might correspond to the perimeter of a diamond, which could be related to the zeros in the input. The input's zeros might be transformed into the 2s in the output's diamond.\n\nBut how do the zeros in the input relate to the 2s in the output? Let's look at Example 0's input:\n\nInput rows:\n[0,0,0,0,3]\n[0,8,8,0,3]\n[0,8,8,0,3]\n[0,0,0,0,3]\n[3,3,3,3,3]\n\nThe output starts with a diamond made of 2s. The diamond's size in the output is larger. So maybe the zeros in the input are converted into a diamond pattern in the output, with 2s along the edges. Then the non-zero cells (like 8 and 3) are expanded into blocks. The 3s in the input's last column and last row are expanded into the rightmost and bottom parts of the output.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 3s are in the last two columns and last two rows. The input's last column has 3s in all rows except the last (which is all 3s). The output's rightmost two columns are all 3s, and the bottom two rows are all 3s. So perhaps each 3 in the input's last column or last row is expanded into two columns or rows. For example, a 3 in the last column becomes two columns in the output. The last row's 3s become two rows.\n\nSo putting this together, the transformation seems to involve:\n\n1. The zeros in the input are transformed into a diamond-shaped border made of 2s in the output. The size of the diamond depends on the size of the input's zero regions.\n\n2. The non-zero cells in the input (excluding the last row and column) are expanded into blocks. For example, an 8 in the input might expand into a 4x4 block of 8s. The expansion factor could be related to the cell's value.\n\n3. The last column and last row of the input are expanded into vertical and horizontal sections in the output. For example, each element in the last column (except the bottom-right corner) is expanded into a vertical block, and the last row (excluding the bottom-right corner) is expanded into a horizontal block. The bottom-right corner (like 3 in Example 0) is expanded into both vertical and horizontal blocks, which combine to form a larger square.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the bottom-right corner is 3. The output's bottom-right has two rows and two columns of 3s, but actually, it's two full rows and two full columns. So perhaps each element in the last column (excluding the last element) is expanded into a certain number of columns, and each element in the last row (excluding the last element) is expanded into a certain number of rows. The last element (bottom-right) is expanded into both rows and columns.\n\nBut how do we determine the expansion factors? For Example 0's last column (excluding the last element) has four 3s. Each 3 in the last column becomes two columns in the output. Similarly, the last row (excluding the last element) has four 3s, each becoming two rows. So the vertical expansion is determined by the elements in the last column, and the horizontal expansion by the elements in the last row.\n\nWait, but Example 0's output has 10 rows and 10 columns. The input is 5x5. So 5 original rows plus 5 added from expansion? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the last column (except the last one) contributes to the number of columns in the output. For example, in Example 0, the last column (before the bottom row) has elements [3,3,3,3], each being 3. So 4 elements, each 3. If each 3 contributes 2 columns, then 4 * 2 = 8 columns, but the output has 10 columns. Hmm, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe the number of columns in the output is the sum of the values in the last row (excluding the last element) plus the number of rows (since the input is square). For Example 0's last row is [3,3,3,3,3]. Excluding the last element, the sum is 3+3+3+3=12. Then 12 + 5 (input rows) =17, which doesn't match the 10 columns. So that's probably not.\n\nLooking back, let's take Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput size 5x5, output 10x10. So each dimension is doubled. But how is each element transformed?\n\nThe diamond pattern in the output's top part (first 8 rows) seems to have a structure where each 2 is placed in positions that form a diamond. For example, the first row of the output has 2 at the first and eighth positions. The second row has 2 at the second and seventh positions, etc. This suggests that the diamond's size is based on the original input's size. For a 5x5 input, the diamond spans 8 rows (since 5*2=10, but the diamond is in the first 8 rows). But how?\n\nAlternatively, the diamond is formed by creating concentric layers. For instance, in Example 0, the 2s are placed such that each layer has 2s spaced further apart. The number of layers might correspond to the input's size.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the Test Input and see if applying a pattern could help.\n\nTest Input:\n[0,6,6,0,8]\n[0,6,6,0,8]\n[0,0,0,0,1]\n[0,0,0,0,7]\n[8,8,1,7,9]\n\nFirst, the input is 5x5. So the output should be larger, perhaps following the same scaling as the examples. For example, if each example's output size is 5 multiplied by a factor. Let's check:\n\nExample 0: 5x5 input \u2192 10x10 output (factor 2)\nExample 1: 5x5 \u2192 15x15 (factor 3)\nExample 2: 5x5 \u2192 20x20 (factor 4)\nSo the factor seems to be increasing. Looking at the inputs:\n\nExample 0's last element (bottom-right) is 3. Output factor 2 (3-1=2? Not sure)\nExample 1's last element is 6. Output factor 3 (6/2=3)\nExample 2's last element is 4. Output factor 4 (4+0=4? Not sure. Wait, last element in Example 2's input is 9. 20/5=4. 9/ something equals 4? 9/2.25=4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factor is determined by the maximum value in the input. Example 0: max 8 \u2192 10 rows (8 + 2 =10?), but 8+2=10. Example 1: max 7 \u2192 15 rows (7*2+1=15? 7*2=14+1=15). Example 2: max 9 \u219220. 9*2+2=20. Hmm, this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the output size is (input size) multiplied by the maximum value divided by something. For Example 0: 5*(8/4)=10. 8/4=2, 5*2=10. Example 1: 5*(7/ (something)). 7/ (15/5)=7/3=2.333. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows in the output is the sum of the last column (excluding the bottom element) plus the sum of the last row (excluding the bottom element) plus the bottom-right element. For Example 0:\n\nLast column (excluding bottom 3): [3,3,3,3] sum 12. Last row (excluding bottom 3): [3,3,3,3] sum 12. Bottom-right 3. So 12+12+3=27. Not matching 10 rows.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the structure of the outputs:\n\nEach output has three main sections:\n\n1. A diamond or hourglass shape made of 2s, possibly derived from the zeros in the input.\n\n2. A central block derived from the non-zero, non-last-row/column elements of the input.\n\n3. A right section derived from the last column of the input (except the bottom element), and a bottom section derived from the last row (except the bottom element), and the bottom-right element expands into a square.\n\nFor example, in Example 0:\n\n- The diamond is made from the zeros in the input. The zeros form a cross in the input, which becomes a diamond in the output.\n\n- The 8s in the input become a block in the output's center.\n\n- The last column's 3s (except bottom) expand into the rightmost two columns, and the last row's 3s (except bottom) expand into the bottom two rows. The bottom-right 3 becomes the intersection of those two, forming a 2x2 block.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\n- The input has 4s and 7s,6s. The output has a central block of 4s, and the right section is 7s and 6s, and the bottom section is 7s and 6s. The diamond of 2s is also present.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n- For each cell in the input that is not in the last row or column:\n\n   - If the value is 0, it's part of the diamond structure in the output, represented by 2s.\n\n   - If the value is non-zero, it's expanded into a block of that number. The size of the block depends on the value. For example, 8 becomes a 4x4 block (since 8/2=4?), 4 becomes a 6x6 block (as in Example 1?), but I'm not sure.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has a cell with value 4, which in the output becomes a block of 6 rows (rows 3-8, inclusive). 6 rows. So 4 is expanded into 6 rows. How?\n\nWait, maybe the value indicates the number of rows or columns. For example, 8 in Example 0's cell becomes a 4x4 block. 8 divided by 2 is 4. So if the value is even, the block size is value/2. For odd values, perhaps (value+1)/2.\n\nBut in Example 1, the 4s are expanded into a block of 6 rows. 4 is not 6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the size of the block is determined by the sum of certain elements. For example, the 4s in Example 1's input are in the first two rows. The output's block of 4s spans 6 rows. Maybe each 4 in the input contributes 3 rows (since there are two rows of 4s, 2*3=6). So each 4 becomes 3 rows. But why 3?\n\nAlternatively, the expansion factor is determined by the value modulo something. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the positions in the input and how they map to the output.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 8s are in positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). In the output, the 8s are in rows 2-5 and columns 2-5 (assuming 0-based). Each input cell becomes a 2x2 block. So 8 becomes a 2x2 block, but scaled by 2. So perhaps each input cell is scaled by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. But then the input is 5x5, so output would be 10x10, which matches Example 0. Let's check:\n\nIf each input cell becomes a 2x2 block, then:\n\n- The 8s would form a 2x2 block in the input \u2192 4x4 in output.\n\n- The 3s in the last column (excluding the bottom) would each be 2x2, but since they're in the last column, they would be in the rightmost 2 columns. Similarly, the last row's 3s (excluding the bottom) would be in the bottom 2 rows.\n\n- The bottom-right 3 would be a 2x2 block in the bottom-right.\n\nThis seems to fit Example 0's output. The 3s in the last column (four cells) would each expand to two columns, but since there are four cells, 4*2 =8 columns, but the output has 10 columns. Wait, no, maybe the scaling is applied to the entire grid. Each cell becomes a 2x2 block, making the output 10x10. Then:\n\n- The 8s in the input's middle would form a 4x4 block.\n\n- The zeros (non-last row/column) would form the diamond structure, which is made of 2s. But why 2s instead of zeros? Maybe the 0s are replaced with a diamond of 2s, which is part of a different pattern.\n\nWait, but in the output, the 2s form a diamond that's larger than the input's zero regions. So perhaps the zeros are transformed into a diamond pattern of 2s, but the size of the diamond is determined by the input's size. For a 5x5 input, the diamond in the output has a certain radius.\n\nAlternatively, the diamond is created by taking the original zeros and expanding them with 2s around them.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's try to apply this scaling idea to the Test Input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRows:\n0,6,6,0,8\n\n0,6,6,0,8\n\n0,0,0,0,1\n\n0,0,0,0,7\n\n8,8,1,7,9\n\nAssuming each cell is scaled by 2 (like Example 0), the output would be 10x10. But in Example 1, the scaling was 3x. So maybe the scaling factor depends on the input's content. For example, the maximum value in the input is 9 (from the Test Input). If scaling factor is ceil(max_value / 4), then 9/4 is 2.25 \u2192 3. But Example 0's max is 8, which would be 2. So 8/4=2. So scaling factor could be max_value divided by 4, rounded up. So for Test Input max 9: 9/4=2.25 \u2192 3. So output size would be 5*3=15x15? But Example 2's max is 9, output size 20x20. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the scaling factor is determined by the bottom-right element. For Example 0, bottom-right is 3, output size 10. 3*3 +1=10. Not sure. Example 1's bottom-right is 6, output 15. 6*2 +3=15. Example 2's bottom-right is 4, output 20. 4*5=20. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's think of another way.\n\nLooking at the Test Input's last row: [8,8,1,7,9]. The last column (excluding the bottom-right 9) is [8,8,1,7]. The last row (excluding 9) is [8,8,1,7]. So each of these elements may expand into a certain number of columns or rows.\n\nFor example, the 8s in the last column (positions 0 and 1) would each expand into a number of columns. If each 8 expands into 2 columns, then 8*2=16 columns? No. But perhaps each element in the last column (except the bottom) contributes to the vertical expansion. Similarly, each element in the last row (except the rightmost) contributes to the horizontal expansion.\n\nFor the Test Input, the last column (excluding 9) is 8,8,1,7. The sum is 8+8+1+7=24. The last row (excluding 9) is 8,8,1,7. Sum is also 24. The output's columns and rows might be 24 + something. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, each element in the last column (except bottom) is the number of rows contributed to the output's right section. For example, in Example 0's last column (before bottom) is [3,3,3,3], sum 12. But Example 0's output has 10 columns. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs again, the rightmost part of the output corresponds to the last column of the input. For example, in Example 0, the last column of the input is [3,3,3,3,3]. The output's last two columns are filled with 3s, but not sure how.\n\nAlternatively, each element in the last column (except the bottom) becomes a vertical block of height equal to the element's value. Similarly, each element in the last row (except the rightmost) becomes a horizontal block of width equal to the element's value. The bottom-right element becomes a block of size value x value.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nLast column (excluding bottom) is four 3s. So vertical blocks would each be 3 rows tall. But the output's right section has two columns of 3s. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother thought: the output is a combination of three parts:\n\n1. The main body, which is a transformed version of the input's upper-left 4x4 matrix (excluding last row and column).\n\n2. The right section: vertical stripes based on the last column (excluding bottom).\n\n3. The bottom section: horizontal stripes based on the last row (excluding rightmost).\n\n4. The bottom-right corner: a square based on the bottom-right element.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- The main body is transformed into a diamond of 2s and a block of 8s.\n\n- The last column (excluding bottom) is four 3s. Each 3 becomes a vertical stripe of 2 columns (since 3/ something). The right section has two columns of 3s.\n\n- The last row (excluding rightmost) is four 3s. Each becomes two rows of 3s.\n\n- The bottom-right 3 becomes a 2x2 block of 3s.\n\nWait, maybe each element in the last column (excluding bottom) is split into two columns. So four elements * 2 = 8 columns. But in Example 0's output, the right section is two columns. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, each element in the last column (excluding bottom) contributes a number of columns equal to their value. For Example 0's last column (excluding bottom) is [3,3,3,3], so 3*4=12 columns. But the output has 10 columns. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the right section's width is the sum of the last column's elements (excluding bottom). For Example 0, sum is 12. But output is 10 columns. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in the output, the numbers from the last column and last row of the input are expanded into vertical and horizontal bands. For example, in Example 0, the last column's 3s are expanded into two vertical columns on the right, and the last row's 3s (excluding the last element) are expanded into two horizontal rows at the bottom. The bottom-right 3 is part of both and becomes a 2x2 block. The other elements in the input are transformed into a diamond and blocks.\n\nSo for the Test Input:\n\nThe last column (excluding the bottom 9) is [8,8,1,7]. Suppose each of these elements contributes to the vertical columns on the right. Similarly, the last row (excluding 9) is [8,8,1,7], contributing to the horizontal rows at the bottom.\n\nIf each element in the last column (excluding bottom) becomes a vertical stripe with width equal to the element's value divided by some factor. For Example 0, 3 becomes 2 columns (3/1.5=2). Example 1's last column (excluding bottom) has 7,7,6,6,6. Wait, no, in Example 1's input, the last column (excluding bottom) is [7,7,6,6]. The output's right section has 3 columns for 7 and 3 for 6. So 7+7+6+6=26. No, Example 1's output has 15 columns, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, each element in the last column contributes a number of columns equal to their value. But in Example 0's case, sum 3+3+3+3=12 columns, which doesn't fit. So this approach isn't working.\n\nMaybe the Test Input's output should have a diamond of 2s, then a central block of 6s (from the 6s in the input), then the right section with 8s, 1, 7s, and the bottom with 8s, 1, 7s, and the bottom-right 9 as a block.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll try to apply what I think might be the case based on Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput zeros become a diamond of 2s.\n\nNon-zero cells (except last row/column) are expanded into larger blocks. For example, 8 becomes a 4x4 block.\n\nLast column elements (3) become vertical stripes of 2 columns each.\n\nLast row elements (3) become horizontal stripes of 2 rows each.\n\nBottom-right 3 becomes a 2x2 block.\n\nApplying this to Test Input:\n\nThe input's zeros are in the first three rows and first and fourth columns. So the diamond would be formed around those. The non-zero cells in the input are 6s, 8s, 1,7, and 9.\n\nThe 6s in the input (positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2)) would expand into blocks. If each 6 is expanded into 3x3 blocks (since 6/2=3?), then four 6s would form a 6x6 block.\n\nThe 8s in the last column (rows 0 and 1) would become vertical stripes of 4 columns each (8/2=4?), leading to 8 columns for the 8s. The 1 in row 2's last column would be 0.5 columns (not possible), so maybe each value is divided by 2, so 1 becomes 0.5 rounded up to 1 column. Similarly, 7 becomes 3.5 rounded to 4 columns.\n\nSimilarly, the last row's 8s and 1,7 would expand into rows. 8 becomes 4 rows each, 1 becomes 0.5 rounded to 1 row, 7 becomes 3.5 rounded to 4 rows.\n\nThe bottom-right 9 would expand into a 4.5x4.5 block, rounded to 5x5.\n\nBut this is all very speculative. \n\nPutting this together, the Test Input's output would have:\n\n- A diamond of 2s in the upper part.\n\n- A central block of 6s (from the input's 6s).\n\n- Right section with vertical stripes: two 8s (each 4 columns), a 1 (1 column), and a 7 (4 columns), totaling 4+4+1+4=13 columns. But the input's last column (excluding 9) is four elements (8,8,1,7), so each contributes 4,4,1,4 columns \u2192 total 13. But the main body might have some columns as well.\n\n- Bottom section with horizontal stripes: two 8s (4 rows each), a 1 (1 row), and a 7 (4 rows), totaling 4+4+1+4=13 rows. \n\n- The bottom-right 9 would be a 5x5 block.\n\nThe total columns would be main body columns + right section columns. For example, main body from the diamond and 6s block, say 10 columns, plus 13 \u2192 23 columns. But this is just a guess.\n\nThis is getting too complex, and since I'm not seeing a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. The key elements seem to be:\n\n- Expanding non-zero cells into larger blocks, possibly scaled by their value.\n\n- Last column and row elements expanding into vertical and horizontal sections.\n\n- Diamond of 2s from zeros.\n\nBased on Example 0's output, where each 3 in the last column becomes two columns, perhaps each element in the last column (excluding the bottom) is multiplied by 2 to determine the number of columns. Similarly for the last row.\n\nTest Input's last column (excluding 9) is 8,8,1,7. If each multiplied by 2: 16,16,2,14 columns. That's way too large. So maybe each element is divided by a certain value. For example, 8 becomes 4 columns (8/2), 1 becomes 0.5 rounded to 1, 7 becomes 3.5 rounded to 4. So 4+4+1+4=13 columns. Similarly for rows.\n\nThen the total columns would be main body + 13. But the main body's size depends on the input's scaling. For example, if the main body is scaled by 2, then 5*2=10 columns. But 10 +13=23 columns, which doesn't fit any pattern from the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the total columns are determined by the sum of the last column's elements (excluding bottom). Test Input's sum is 8+8+1+7=24. So 24 columns? But Example 0's sum is 3+3+3+3=12, output columns 10. Doesn't match.\n\nThis is not working. Given the time I've spent, I'll try to mimic the structure of the examples for the Test Input.\n\nThe Test Input's last row is [8,8,1,7,9]. The last column is [8,8,1,7,9]. The bottom-right is 9.\n\nAssuming the output's right section has vertical stripes corresponding to the last column (excluding 9). Each element contributes a certain number of columns. For example:\n\n- 8 becomes 4 columns (8/2=4)\n\n- 8 becomes 4 columns\n\n- 1 becomes 1 column\n\n- 7 becomes 3.5 rounded to 4 columns\n\nTotal right columns: 4+4+1+4=13\n\nSimilarly, the bottom section (last row excluding 9) is 8,8,1,7. Each contributes rows:\n\n- 8\u21924 rows\n\n- 8\u21924 rows\n\n- 1\u21921 row\n\n-7\u21924 rows\n\nTotal bottom rows: 4+4+1+4=13\n\nThe diamond section would be from the input's zeros, forming a diamond of 2s. The central block would be the 6s expanded. The main body's rows and columns would be determined by the diamond's size and the 6s' expansion.\n\nAssuming the main body has 8 rows (like Example 0's diamond), plus the 13 bottom rows, total 21 rows. But the examples have output rows that are multiples of 5 (10,15,20). The Test Input's output might be 25 rows (5*5), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output's total size is (sum of last column elements excluding bottom) + (sum of last row elements excluding bottom) + bottom-right element. For Test Input: 8+8+1+7 +8+8+1+7 +9= 24+24+9=57. Not helpful.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to create an output structure based on the examples. Here's my best guess:\n\nThe Test Input's output will have:\n\n- A diamond of 2s in the upper part.\n\n- A block of 6s in the middle from the input's 6s.\n\n- The right section will have vertical stripes for 8,8,1,7 (from the last column), each scaled.\n\n- The bottom section will have horizontal stripes for 8,8,1,7 (from the last row), each scaled.\n\n- The bottom-right corner will have a block of 9s.\n\nThe exact scaling might be 2x for non-zero elements. So each 6 becomes a 2x2 block, each 8 becomes a 4x4 block, etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nAfter several attempts, I'll proceed to format the output as per the examples, with diamond 2s, blocks of numbers, and the right and bottom sections expanded.",
