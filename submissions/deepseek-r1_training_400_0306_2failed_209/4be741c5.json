        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the training examples and find out how the input arrays are transformed into the output. Then apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input: there are multiple arrays. The output is [4, 2, 8]. Let me check the first input array. The first array in Example 0 is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8]. The output lists 4, then 2, then 8. Noticing that in each input array, the numbers are grouped in sequences. Like the first array has a bunch of 4s, then 2s, then 8s. The output seems to list the numbers in the order they appear in the input array, but each only once. But wait, the output is [4, 2, 8], which are the distinct elements in the order they first appear in the input arrays. But looking at all the input arrays in Example 0, each array starts with 4s, then transitions to 2s, then to 8s. So maybe the output is the sequence of numbers in the order they appear when moving through all the input arrays. Wait, but all the input arrays in Example 0 have the same order: 4s followed by 2s followed by 8s, maybe varying in counts. So the output is taking the unique elements in the order they first appear across all arrays. But wait, each input array may have the same order, but the output is just the sequence of the unique numbers in the order they appear in each array. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input. The first few arrays are all 2s, then there's an array that starts with 2, then 8s, then 2s again, then 8s. Then the output is [2], [8], [5]. Wait, but how does that split into three separate lists? Oh, maybe each group of arrays that transition to a new number contributes to the output. For instance, in Example 1, the first few arrays are all 2s. Then the fourth array has 2,8,8,8,2,2,8. Then the next arrays are all 8s. Then the seventh array starts mixing 8 and 5, then 5s. So the output is the sequence of dominant numbers as they transition. So the output lists each new number that becomes the leading one in the arrays. Like the first group is all 2s, then transitions to 8s, then to 5s. So the output is [2], [8], [5]. Each new \"phase\" in the input arrays adds a new element to the output list.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the output is [6], [4], [2], [3]. Looking at the input arrays, the first array is all 6s, then the next start mixing 6 and 4, then arrays with 4s, then arrays with 4 and 2, then 2s, then 2 and 3, then 3s. So each major transition in the dominant numbers leads to a new element in the output list.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the output is the sequence of numbers that represent the \"stages\" of the input arrays. Each stage is when the arrays transition to a new number. The output lists each new number in the order they first become the leading element in the arrays.\n\nLooking at the test input. Let's see:\n\nThe test input has 14 arrays. Let's check each array's elements in order.\n\nFirst array: [3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,8,8] \u2192 starts with 3s, then 2s, then 1s, then 8s.\n\nSecond array: [3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,8,8,8] \u2192 starts with 3s, then 2s, then 1s, then 8s.\n\nThird array: [3,3,3,3,3,2,2,1,1,1,8,8,8,8] \u2192 3s, 2s, 1s, 8s.\n\nFourth array: [3,3,3,3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,8,8,8] \u2192 same as above.\n\nFifth array: [3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,8,8] \u2192 same.\n\nSixth array: [3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,8] \u2192 3s, 2s, 1s, 8.\n\nSeventh array: [3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,8,8] \u2192 3s, 2s, 1s, 8.\n\nEighth array: [3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,8,8,8] \u2192 same.\n\nNinth array: [3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,8,8] \u2192 same.\n\nTenth array: [3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,8,8] \u2192 3s, 2s, 1s, 8.\n\nEleventh array: [3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8] \u2192 same.\n\nTwelfth array: [3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,8,8] \u2192 same.\n\nThirteenth array: [3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,1,1,1,8,8] \u2192 3s, 2s, 1s, 8s.\n\nSo all the test input arrays start with 3s, then transition to 2s, then 1s, then 8s. So according to the pattern from the examples, the output should list the numbers in the order they appear as the leading elements in the arrays. Since all arrays start with 3, then next is 2, then 1, then 8. But wait, in the test input, each array has 3s first, then 2s, then 1s, then 8s. So the stages here are 3, then 2, then 1, then 8. So the output should list each of these in order, each in their own brackets. So the output would be [3], [2], [1], [8].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Looking at the training examples:\n\nIn Example 0, the input is multiple lists, and the output is [4, 2, 8]. Let's see what those numbers represent. Each input list has sequences of 4s, then 2s, then 8s. For instance, the first list starts with seven 4s, then seven 2s, then two 8s. The output seems to capture the distinct numbers in the order they first appear across the lists. But wait, all the lists have 4, then 2, then 8, so the output is those three numbers in order.\n\nExample 1's input has lists that start with 2s, then some 8s, then some 5s. The output is [2], [8], [5]. But wait, each output line is a single number. Maybe each line in the output represents the number that appears first in each row? Let me check. The first three lists are all 2s, so the output's first line is [2]. Then the next lists transition to 8s, so next output line is [8], and finally 5s. So the output lists the first element of each consecutive group of lists. So when the starting number changes, a new line is added to the output with that new number. So it's grouping consecutive input lists that start with the same number, and the output lists those starting numbers in order.\n\nWait, in Example 0, all input lists start with 4, then some transition to 4s followed by 2s, but maybe each list's first element is being tracked. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input lists, the first elements are all 4s. But looking at all the input lists, maybe each list starts with 4, then transitions to 2, then 8. But the output is [4,2,8]. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the output is the sequence of numbers that start each row, but only when they change. Wait, in Example 0, all the input lists start with 4. Then why is the output [4,2,8]? Wait, maybe each list is a row, and the output is the order of numbers that first appear in the entire sequence when moving from top to bottom. Or perhaps the output is the sequence of numbers that start each row, but in the order they first appear in the entire collection of lists. That doesn't fit because in Example 0, all rows start with 4. So that can't be it.\n\nAlternative approach: Looking at the outputs. Example 0's output is [4,2,8]. Let's look at the first input list: [4,4,...2,2...,8,8]. So the list transitions from 4s to 2s to 8s. The output lists these numbers in the order they appear in the list. Then, all the other input lists in Example 0 probably follow a similar structure where the elements transition from 4 to 2 to 8. So the output is capturing the order of the distinct elements in the first input list. Wait, but all the input lists in Example 0 might have the same sequence of numbers (4s, then 2s, then 8s) but varying counts. So the output is just listing the unique elements in the order they first appear in any of the input lists. But that's not exactly, since Example 1's output has three lines: [2], [8], [5]. So each line in the output corresponds to a group of input lists that start with the same number.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the first three lists start with 2, then the next few start with 8, then 5. So the output is each of those starting numbers in order. So the output is the distinct starting numbers of the input lists in the order they appear. So each time the starting number of the input lists changes, a new entry is added to the output. For Example 1, the first three lists start with 2, so output line is [2]. Then the next lists start with 8, so next output line [8]. Then the next start with 5, so [5]. Similarly, in Example 2, the first list starts with 6, then next with 6, then 6, then 4, then 4, etc. So the output would be [6], [4], [2], [3], each corresponding to the first elements of consecutive lists with the same starting number.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2:\n\nInput lists:\n\n1. [6,6,6...]\n2. [6,6,4...]\n3. [6,4,4...]\n4. [4,4,4...] (three times)\n5. [4,2,2...]\n6. [2,2,2...]\n7. [2,3,2...]\n8. [3,3,3...] (twice)\n\nSo the starting numbers are: 6,6,6,4,4,4,4,2,2,3,3. So groups:\n\n- First three lists start with 6 \u2192 output [6]\n- Next four start with 4 \u2192 [4]\n- Next two start with 2 \u2192 [2]\n- Then two with 3 \u2192 [3]\n\nWhich matches the output of Example 2: [6], [4], [2], [3].\n\nSimilarly, Example 1's input lists start with 2,2,2,2,8,8,8,5,5. So groups:\n\n- 2 (four times?), wait the input has 9 lists:\n\nList 0: starts with 2\nList 1: starts with 2\nList 2: starts with 2\nList 3: starts with 2 (but the list is [2,8,8...], so first element is 2)\nList 4: starts with 8\nList 5: starts with 8\nList 6: starts with 8\nList 7: starts with 5\nList 8: starts with 5\n\nSo the starting numbers are: 2,2,2,2,8,8,8,5,5. So groups:\n\n2 (four lists), 8 (three lists), 5 (two lists). So output is [2], [8], [5], each on a new line, matching the output.\n\nThen the pattern is: for the input lists, group consecutive lists that have the same first element. For each such group, output the first element in a list. The output is a list of these elements in the order they appear as starting elements of the groups.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nLooking at the test input lists, each starts with 3. Let's check:\n\nTest input lists:\n\nAll 14 lists start with 3. Let's check each first element:\n\nList 0: [3,3,3,...] \u2192 starts with 3\nList 1: [3,3,3,2...] \u2192 starts with 3\n...\nList 13: [3,3,3,3,3,3,2...] \u2192 starts with 3.\n\nSo all lists in the test input start with 3. Therefore, the entire group is consecutive with the same starting number 3. So the output should be [3].\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any variation. Let me go through each test input list's first element:\n\nTest Input:\n\nEach line starts with 3:\n\n1. [3,3,3,3,2...]\n2. [3,3,3,2...]\n3. [3,3,3,3,3...]\n4. [3,3,3,3,3...]\n5. [3,3,3,3,2...]\n6. [3,3,3,3,3...]\n7. [3,3,3,2...]\n8. [3,3,3,3...]\n9. [3,3,3,3...]\n10. [3,3,3,2...]\n11. [3,3,3,3...]\n12. [3,3,3,3...]\n13. [3,3,3,3...]\n\nYes, all start with 3. So the entire test input is a single group where the first element is 3. Therefore, the output should be [3].",
