        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input arrays into the output arrays based on the training examples. Then apply that to the test input. Let me look at each example carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a bunch of 8s and a few 0s and a 2. The output seems to have the 2s propagating diagonally down and to the right. Like, in row 5 (0-indexed maybe?), there's a 2. Then in row 6, there's 8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2... So the 2s are spreading out each row, moving one position to the right and down. So maybe the rule is that certain numbers (like 2) are moving down and to the right, creating a diagonal pattern. Also, the 0s might stay in place or maybe influence the movement.\n\nExample 1 has a 3 in the input. The output shows the 3 spreading upwards and creating a sort of diamond or pyramid shape. In the input, the 3 is in row 7, column 4. Then in the output, the rows below (rows 8 onwards) start having 3s spreading left and right. Like row 8 has 3,3,3 in columns 3-5. Then row 9 has 3,1,3, etc. So maybe when there's a number (like 3 here), it's creating a pattern that spreads outward in subsequent rows, each time moving further left and right, but decreasing in some way. Wait, in row 8, it's 3,3,3, then row 9 is 3,1,3, then row 10 is 3,3,3 again? Or maybe not. Let me check the output again. Oh, in example 1's output, after the row with 3, the next rows have increasing 3s but with 1s in between. Like row 8: [1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, ...], then row 9 has 1,3,1,3... Hmm, maybe it's a different pattern. Wait, looking at the output of example 1:\n\nThe 3 in row 7 (input) leads to row 8 having three 3s (positions 3,4,5?), then row 9 has 3 at position 1,3,5? Not sure. Maybe the 3 is expanding upwards, creating a kind of triangular pattern. But the exact mechanism isn't clear yet.\n\nExample 2's input has 4s and some 0s and an 8. The output shows the 8 spreading in some way. In the input, there's an 8 in row 4, column 11. The output has that 8 turning into 8,8 in columns 11-12, and some 8s appearing in other rows. Also, the 0s in rows 5 and 6 are preserved. Maybe the 8 is being replicated to the right and down? Or perhaps certain numbers are being copied to adjacent cells in subsequent rows. But the exact rule isn't obvious.\n\nLooking for a common pattern across all examples. Each example has a number (like 2, 3, 8) that's placed in the input, and in the output, that number is spreading in some directional way. For instance, in example 0, the 2 in row 5 column 6 leads to 2s appearing diagonally in each subsequent row. Similarly, in example 1, the 3 in row 7 column 4 leads to 3s spreading upwards and outwards. Example 2's 8 is perhaps replicating in a specific pattern.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the transformation is that each non-zero number (other than the background number, which is 8,1,4,3 in the examples) is moving down and to the right, creating a diagonal trail. Let's check example 0 again. The initial 2 is in row 5, column 6. In the output, the next row (6) has 2s at columns 6 and 8, then row 7 has 2s at 6 and 8 again but shifted? Wait, the output of example 0's rows after the input's 2:\n\nInput row 5 (0-indexed?): [8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8...]\n\nOutput row 6: [8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,8...]\n\nWait, row 6 in output: positions 5 and 7 are 2s. Then row 7: positions 6 and 8. Then row 8: 7 and 9. So each time, the 2s are moving to the right by one each row. So maybe each non-zero number (except the background number) is moving down and to the right each row. So for every cell that's not the background (like 8 in example 0, 1 in example 1, 4 in example 2), if there's a number, it moves down and right by one each step. But in example 1, the 3 in row 7, column 4 (assuming rows are 0-indexed) moves to row 8, columns 3,4,5? Wait, the output row 8 is [1,1,1,3,3,3,1...], which is columns 3-5. So maybe it's not moving down and right, but expanding in some way. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the pattern is that each number (other than the background) is generating a trail downwards and to the right, but each step the trail branches out. For example, in example 0, the 2 starts at row 5, column 6. Then each subsequent row, the 2 appears one step to the right and down. But in example 0's output, after row 5, row 6 has 2 at position 6, and then 8,2. Wait, maybe each time, the existing number moves down and right, and also splits into adjacent positions. Not sure.\n\nLooking at example 1 again: The input has a 3 in row 7, column 4 (assuming first row is 0). The output row 8 has three 3s in columns 3,4,5. Then row 9 has 3 at 1,3,5. Then row 10 has 3 at 0,2,4. So the 3s are spreading upwards and left/right each row. So the pattern might be that each number (non-background) creates a V-shape or expanding pattern upwards. But how does that fit with example 0, where the 2 is moving down and right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are moving in a certain direction based on their value. Like, 2 moves down-right, 3 moves up and expands, 8 moves in a different way. But that's more complicated.\n\nWait, let's look for the position of the non-background numbers in the input and how they appear in the output.\n\nIn example 0:\n\nThe input has a 2 in row 5, column 6 (assuming rows start at 0). The output shows in row 6, column 5 and 7 (since output row 6 is [8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,...]. Then row 7: columns 6 and 8. So each step, the 2 moves down one row and right one column. But then in row 8, it's 7 and 9. So each time, the 2 splits into two, moving right each time. Wait, but in the output of example 0, the 2 in row 5, column 6 becomes two 2s in row 6 (columns 5 and 7?), then each of those moves down and right again. So it's creating a diagonal line that splits into two each time. But how does that happen? Because in row 6, columns 5 and 7 have 2s, then row 7 has 6 and 8, etc. So each 2 in a row spawns a new 2 to the right and down. So maybe the rule is that each cell with a non-background number (not 8 in example 0) is copied down and to the right in the next row. But in the first example, the 2 is copied down and right, then the next row copies those again, leading to a spreading effect.\n\nBut in example 1, the 3 in row 7, column 4 (assuming rows start at 0) leads to in row 8, columns 3,4,5 having 3s. Then row 9 has 1,3,1,3,1... So perhaps the 3s are moving left and right as well as down. Or maybe expanding in all directions. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are moving upwards, not down. Because in example 1, the 3 is in row 7, and the next rows (8,9,10, etc.) are below it, but the 3s appear in higher rows. Wait no, in example 1's output, the rows after the input's 3 (row 7) are rows 8,9,10,11,12. The 3s start in row 8, then spread upward. Wait, the input has the 3 in row 7. Output row 8 is below row 7. So maybe the 3s are moving down, but their positions are expanding left and right. For example, row 8 has 3s in columns 3-5. Then row 9 has 3 in column 1,3,5. Then row 10 has 3 in columns 0,2,4. Then row 11 has 3 in columns 0 and 1. So it's like the 3s are spreading left and right as they move down. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-background number (like 3 in example 1) creates a pattern where each subsequent row shifts left and right, creating a diamond shape. For example, the 3 in row 7, column 4. The next row (8) has 3s at 3,4,5. Then row 9: 1,3,1,3,1... Wait, no, the actual row 9 in example1's output is [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, ...]. Hmm, perhaps the 3s are moving diagonally left-up and right-up, but the rows are arranged from top to bottom. So if the input has a 3 in a certain position, then in the next rows below it, the 3s spread outwards. For example, row 7 has a 3. Row 8 (the next row below) has three 3s around it. Then each subsequent row, the 3s spread further left and right, but perhaps with some decay (like changing to 1s after a certain point). Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the background number is the majority in the input. For example, in example 0, the background is 8. The 0s and 2 are non-background. In example 1, the background is 1, with 0 and 3. In example 2, background is 4, with 0 and 8. So perhaps the transformation is that any non-background number (i.e., not equal to the background value) propagates in some way. For each non-background cell, they create a trail downwards and possibly to the sides.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input has an 8 in row 4, column 11. The output in row 0, columns 11-14 have 8s. Wait, the first row of the output is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,4,8,8]. So the 8 in row 4, column 11 is now in row 0, columns 11-12, etc. That's a bit confusing. How does the 8 from row 4 end up in row 0? That would imply moving upwards, which contradicts the previous examples. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are being shifted upwards. But that might not fit. Or perhaps the numbers are being replicated in a certain direction based on their value. For example, 8s move upwards, 3s move diagonally, etc. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern involves gravity. Like, numbers fall down unless blocked. But in example 0, the 2 is in row 5, then in the output, the 2s are in lower rows. So maybe the 2 is falling down. But in the output, the 2s are in row 6, then 7, etc. So each 2 moves down one row each step. But in example 0's output, the 2s also move to the right. So maybe they're falling diagonally. Like, each non-background number moves down and to the right in each subsequent row.\n\nIn example 0's input, the 2 is at row 5, column 6. In the output, row 6 has 2 at column 5 and 7 (no, wait, looking at example 0's output row 6: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8] \u2014 wait no, the output of example 0's row 6 is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. Wait, no. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn example 0's input, the rows are from top to bottom. The 2 is in the fifth row (index 5 if starting at 0?), and the sixth element of that row (index 6). Then in the output, looking at the sixth row (the same as input's fifth row?), no. Wait, example 0's input has 12 rows. Output also has 12 rows. Let me recheck:\n\nInput for example 0 is:\n\nRow 0-2: all 8s.\n\nRow 3: 8,8,8,8,0,8...\n\nRow4:8,8,8,0,8,0...\n\nRow5:8,8,8,8,0,8,2,8...\n\nThen the output's row5 is the same as input row5. Then row6 in output has 8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2... So the 2 from row5, column6 is now in row6, column5 and7. Then row7 has 2 in 6 and8. So each time, the 2 is splitting into two positions: one to the left and one to the right, then moving down each time. Wait, the first 2 is at row5, col6. Next row (row6) has 2 at col5 and7. Then row7 has 2 at col6 and8. Then row8 has 7 and9. So the 2s are moving diagonally down and to the right and left alternately. Or perhaps each 2 in a row spawns two 2s in the next row, shifted left and right. But that's not exactly matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is moving down and to the right, but also the 0s are causing some effect. For example, the 0s in the input might be acting as \"seeds\" for the 2 to spread. But in example0's input, there are 0s in rows3-5, but the output's 2s start at row5 and spread down. So perhaps the 0s are part of the pattern. Maybe the 2 is following a path created by the 0s. For instance, in example0's input, the 0s form a kind of vertical line, and the 2 starts at the bottom of that line. Then the output shows the 2 moving down and to the right, following the 0 path. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at example2's input and output. The input has an 8 in row4, column11. The output's first few rows have 8s in columns 11-12 and other positions. So maybe the 8 is propagating upwards and to the right. Wait, in the output, row0 (the first row) has 8s in column11 and12. So the 8 from row4 in the input is now in row0. That suggests moving upwards, which contradicts previous examples. This makes me think that the direction of propagation depends on the value of the number. For example, 2 moves down-right, 3 moves up-left, 8 moves up. But this complicates the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the propagation direction is determined by the number's value modulo some base. But without more examples, this is hard to deduce.\n\nAnother approach: let's see if the output for each example is the input with some kind of cellular automaton applied. For example, each cell in the output depends on the cell above it or its neighbors. For example, in example0's output, the 2s form diagonal lines, which could be a result of each 2 moving down and right. So each row's cell is copied from the cell above and to the left. So for cell (i,j) in the output, it's equal to cell (i-1, j-1) if that was a non-background number. But in example0's input, the 2 is at (5,6). Then output row6 (i=6), j=5 would be from (5,4)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-background number in the input is the start of a diagonal line that extends down and to the right. So the 2 in example0 starts at (5,6), then in the next rows, it's at (6,7), (7,8), etc. But example0's output has 2s in (6,5 and7), which doesn't fit. So maybe it's not a straight diagonal.\n\nWait, in example0's output:\n\nRow5 (input's row5): [8,8,8,8,0,8,2,8...]\n\nOutput row6: [8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,8...]\n\nSo from row5's 2 at position6, row6 has 2s at positions5 and7. Then row7 has 2s at positions6 and8. So it's like the 2 is splitting into two each time, moving left and right, then those split again. But each split moves down a row. So the pattern is expanding like a binary tree. The first 2 splits into two, then each of those splits into two again, but shifted down.\n\nSo in example0's output, the 2 in row5, col6 leads to two 2s in row6, cols5 and7. Then each of those leads to two 2s in row7, cols4,6 and6,8. But in the example's output, row7 is [8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,8...]. So cols6 and8. Then row8 has 7 and9. So it's not splitting every time. Maybe each 2 in a row creates a new 2 to the left and right in the next row. But in row6, the two 2s are at5 and7. Then in row7, the 2s are at6 and8. So it's not left and right, but each 2 is moving down and to the right by one. Wait, the 2 at row6, col5 moves to row7, col6. The 2 at row6, col7 moves to row7, col8. Then each of those moves to the next row's right. So each 2 moves down and to the right by one. But how did the initial 2 split into two in row6?\n\nMaybe the rule is that each non-background number moves down and to the right by one, and also down and to the left by one. So creating two copies each time. That would explain the spreading. For example, the initial 2 in row5, col6 would generate two 2s in row6: col5 (left) and7 (right). Then each of those generates two more in row7: col4 and6 from the left, and6 and8 from the right. But in the example's output, row6 has 2s at5 and7. Row7 has 2s at6 and8. So maybe only the rightward movement is happening. Because row6's 5 and7 would move to 6 and8 in row7. So each 2 moves down and to the right by one. So the initial 2 at (5,6) moves to (6,7), but in the output, row6 has 2s at5 and7. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are moving down and to the right and also down and to the left. But in example0's output, only the rightward movement is visible. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think about the direction. If the number is moving down and to the right, then each row's 2 would be one position down and right. But example0's output shows multiple 2s in each subsequent row. So maybe each 2 creates a new 2 in the next row to the right and down, and also leaves a copy behind. But that would lead to more 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each non-background number \"falls\" diagonally down and to the right, and each subsequent row has the number shifted right by one. So, for example, a 2 in column6 of row5 would appear in column7 of row6, column8 of row7, etc. But in example0's output, the 2s appear in columns5 and7 of row6. That suggests a split into two directions: left and right. So each non-background number splits into two in the next row, one left and one right, then each of those splits again. This creates a V-shaped pattern.\n\nSo in example0, the initial 2 splits into left and right in row6 (5 and7). Then each of those splits into left and right in row7 (4 and6 for 5, and6 and8 for7). But in the output, row7 has 2s at6 and8. So maybe only the right splits are kept. Or perhaps there's a different rule. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are moving in a specific direction based on their value modulo 4, but that's a stretch.\n\nLet me look at example2's output. The input has an 8 in row4, column11. The output's first row (row0) has 8s in columns11 and12, etc. So the 8 is appearing higher up. So it's moving upwards. So maybe the direction depends on the number's value. For example, 2 moves down-right, 3 moves up-left, 8 moves up-right. But how to confirm this.\n\nIn example1's output, the 3 in row7, column4 leads to 3s in row8, columns3-5, then row9, columns1,3,5, etc. So each time, the 3s are moving left and right, but also down. So the direction could be that each 3 spreads left and right as it moves down, creating a diamond pattern. For example, each 3 in row i, column j, creates 3s in row i+1, j-1, j, j+1. But the background number is 1. So when a 3 is present, it propagates to adjacent cells below. But example1's output shows that after row7 (with a 3 in column4), row8 has 3s in 3-5, then row9 has 3s in 1,3,5. So each step, the leftmost and rightmost 3s in a row spawn new 3s further left and right in the next row. So it's expanding outward each row.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for each non-background number, in the next row, it spreads to the cell directly below, and to the left and right. But then each of those cells does the same. So this creates a diamond-shaped expansion. For example, a single non-background number would create a triangle of numbers expanding downward.\n\nBut in example0's output, the 2 starts in row5, column6. Then row6 has 2s in5 and7. Row7 has6 and8. So each step, the 2s are moving down and to the left and right. So maybe each non-background number spreads to the two adjacent cells (left and right) in the next row. This would create a V-shape. But in example0's output, the 2s are only moving right. Wait, in example0's output, the 2s are moving down and to the right each time. But the first step from row5 to6 has a left and right. Then from row6 to7, each of those moves right. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the direction depends on the number. For example, 2 moves to the right, 3 moves to the left and right, 8 moves upwards. But this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is determined by the number's parity. Even numbers move right, odd numbers move left. But 3 is odd and in example1, it's moving left and right. So that's not it.\n\nAnother observation: in example0's output, the 0s are present in the same positions as the input. So the 0s are fixed and don't change. The 2s are the ones moving. Similarly, in example1's input, the 0s are preserved, and the 3 moves. So the 0s are part of the background or static elements. So maybe the rule is that any number that is not the background number (like 8 in example0, 1 in example1, 4 in example2) and not 0 will propagate in some way. The 0s are part of the static structure.\n\nSo the transformation applies to numbers that are neither the background nor 0.\n\nNow, the test input's background is 3. The non-background numbers are 6 and 0. Wait, the test input has a 6 in row5, column3, and several 0s. So the 6 is a non-background number (since background is 3). The 0s are static. So according to the pattern, the 6 should propagate in some way.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe test input is a grid with mostly 3s, except:\n\nRow5: [3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow6: [3,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow7: [3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow8: [3,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nSo the non-background numbers are the 6 in row5, column3, and the 0s in rows6,7,8.\n\nThe 0s are static, so they will remain in place. The 6 should propagate according to the pattern. So the output should show the 6 propagating in some direction. Based on the previous examples, perhaps the 6 will propagate down and to the right, creating a diagonal.\n\nBut what's the pattern for propagation? Let's see:\n\nIn example0, the 2 (non-background) propagates down and to the right, creating a diagonal. Each step, the 2 moves down and to the right. So in row5, column6, then row6, column7, etc. But wait, the output of example0 shows the 2 splitting into two directions. So maybe the rule is that each non-background number splits into two in the next row, one to the left and one to the right, then each of those splits again. But in example0's output, the 2s only move to the right. Maybe the direction is based on the number's value modulo something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-background number moves down and to the right, and down and to the left, creating a V-shape. But in example0's output, only the right direction is taken. Or maybe the direction depends on the number's value. For example, even numbers move right, odd numbers move left. But in example1, 3 is odd and it moves both left and right. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the number's value indicates the direction. Like 2 moves right, 3 moves left and right, 8 moves up, etc. But this is speculation.\n\nIn example2, the 8 is in row4, column11. The output shows 8s appearing in higher rows (like row0). So maybe 8 moves upwards. So for the test input, the 6 would move in a direction based on its value. For example, 6 modulo 4 is 2, so moves like 2 (down-right). But I need to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is determined by the number itself. For example:\n\n- 2 moves down-right.\n\n- 3 moves down and spreads left and right.\n\n- 8 moves up-right.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn example1's output, the 3 in row7, column4 leads to 3s in row8, columns3-5 (spread left and right). Then row9, columns1,3,5 (spread further left and right). So each step, the 3s spread two cells left and right. So the number of 3s increases by two each row. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, each non-background number spreads to adjacent cells below, left, and right. But in example0, the 2 spreads down and right, but not left. So maybe the direction is down and right for even numbers and down and left for odd numbers. But in example1's 3 (odd), it spreads left and right. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers spread in all directions possible, but the background is blocking them. For example, in example0's 2, the background is 8. The 2 can only spread to cells that are background (8) or 0. But in example0, the 0s are static. So the 2 moves down and right into cells that are 8. But in example0's output, the 2s are placed where there were 8s in the input. So maybe the rule is that a non-background number can move into a background cell, replacing it, and then continue moving from there.\n\nBut in example0's output, the 2s are moving into the 8 cells. So the 2s are replacing the 8s as they propagate.\n\nSo for the test input, the 6 is a non-background number (since background is 3). So it should propagate into the 3 cells. The 0s are static.\n\nSo, how does the 6 propagate? Looking back at the examples:\n\n- In example0, the 2 propagates down and to the right each row, creating a diagonal line.\n\n- In example1, the 3 propagates downward, spreading left and right each row, creating a diamond shape.\n\n- In example2, the 8 propagates upward and to the right, creating a pattern in higher rows.\n\nThis suggests that the direction of propagation is determined by the number's value. For instance:\n\n- 2 (even): moves down-right.\n\n- 3 (odd): spreads left and right while moving down.\n\n- 8 (even): moves up-right.\n\nBut how to confirm this?\n\nAlternatively, the number's value modulo 4 determines direction:\n\n- 0: up\n\n- 1: right\n\n- 2: down\n\n- 3: left\n\nBut this is just a guess. Looking at example0's 2: 2 modulo4 is 2 \u2192 down. But the 2 is moving down and right. Example1's 3: 3 modulo4 is 3 \u2192 left, but the 3 is spreading left and right. Example2's 8: 8 modulo4 is 0 \u2192 up. Which aligns with the 8 moving up.\n\nIf this is the case, then for the test input's 6: 6 modulo4 is 2 \u2192 down. So perhaps 6 moves down. But in example0, 2 modulo4 is 2 \u2192 down, but the 2 moves down and right. So maybe the direction is down for even numbers, but the exact path depends on the number's value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number's value indicates the direction in terms of delta rows and columns. For example:\n\n- 2: down 1, right 1 each step.\n\n- 3: down 1, left 1 and right 1 each step.\n\n- 8: up 1, right 1 each step.\n\nBut this needs to fit the examples.\n\nFor example0's 2:\n\nStarts at row5, column6.\n\nEach step:\n\nRow increases by 1, column increases by 1.\n\nSo next positions are (6,7), (7,8), etc. But in the output, the 2s are at (6,5 and7), (7,6 and8), etc. So this doesn't align. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach: in example0's output, each 2 in a row generates two 2s in the next row: one to the left and one to the right. Then those each generate two in the next row, etc. But the output shows that each row has two 2s, each shifted one position right. So perhaps each 2 generates a single new 2 to the right each row.\n\nWait, in example0's output:\n\nRow5: 2 at col6.\n\nRow6: 2s at col5 and7.\n\nRow7: 2s at col6 and8.\n\nRow8: 2s at col7 and9.\n\nSo each row's 2s are moving to the right by one, and also shifting down. So for example, the 2 at col5 in row6 moves to col6 in row7. The 2 at col7 in row6 moves to col8 in row7. So each 2 is moving down and to the right by one each time. But how does the initial 2 in row5 generate two 2s in row6?\n\nAh, maybe the initial number generates two directions: one to the left and one to the right. But then each of those moves down and right. So the 2 in row5, col6 splits into row6, col5 (left) and7 (right). Then each of those in row6 move down and right to row7, col6 and8. Then those move to row8, col7 and9. So the left branch moves to the right each time, and the right branch also moves right. So the overall effect is two diagonal lines moving right and down.\n\nThis would explain the pattern in example0's output. Similarly, in example1's 3:\n\nThe 3 in row7, col4 splits into row8, col3,4,5 (left, center, right). Then each of those splits into row9, col1,3,5. Wait, no. In example1's output, row8 has 3s at3,4,5. Then row9 has 3s at1,3,5. So each 3 in row8's col3 generates a 3 in row9's col1 and3. The one in col4 generates 3 in col3 and5. The one in col5 generates 3 in col5 and7. But this doesn't fit exactly. \n\nAlternatively, the 3 spreads to the left and right each row, but the number of 3s increases by two each time. So row7: 1, row8:3, row9:5, etc. But the example1's output shows row8 has 3 3s, row9 has 3 3s (columns1,3,5), row10 has 3s in columns0,2,4, which is three again. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a general rule that fits all examples.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nAny non-background number (not equal to the background value and not 0) will propagate in the next row by moving down and to the right by (value) steps. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, each non-background number (other than 0) creates a diagonal line downwards and to the right, starting from its position, with each subsequent row having the number shifted one to the right and down.\n\nIn example0, the 2 is at row5, column6. So the next rows would have 2s at (6,7), (7,8), etc. But the output shows that in row6, the 2s are at 5 and7. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the number indicates how many steps to move. For example, 2 moves two cells down and right. But example0's 2 is moving one each step.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's look for another approach.\n\nPerhaps the output is the input with each non-background number replaced by a diagonal line of that number extending down and to the right. For example, each non-background number (like 2,3,8) creates a diagonal line in the output.\n\nIn example0's output, the 2 creates a diagonal from row5, col6 to the last row. But in the output, the 2s are in multiple columns each row. So it's not a single diagonal.\n\nWait, in example0's output, starting from row5's 2, the next row has two 2s, then two more each row. The distance between them increases. So it's forming a V-shape. But the V-shape's arms are moving down and to the right.\n\nSo maybe the rule is that each non-background number generates a V-shape spreading outwards each row. Each time, the number is placed to the left and right of the previous position, creating a wider V each row.\n\nFor example, the 2 in row5, col6:\n\n- row6: col5 and7\n\n- row7: col4,6,8 (but in the example, it's col6 and8)\n\nHmm, maybe it's only moving right each time. Like, each 2 in a row generates a new 2 to the right in the next row. So:\n\nRow5: col6 \u2192 row6: col7 \u2192 row7: col8, etc. But in example0's output, row6 has two 2s. So maybe the initial 2 generates two directions: left and right. \n\nThis is getting too vague. Let's think about the test input.\n\nThe test input has a 6 in row5, column3. The background is 3, so 6 is a non-background number. Based on the examples, the 6 should propagate in some pattern. \n\nIf we assume that each non-background number propagates down and to the right, creating a diagonal, then the 6 in row5, column3 would appear in row6, column4; row7, column5; etc. But there are 0s in row6, column4 and6. Since 0s are static, the 6 would not override them. So maybe the 6 propagates around the 0s.\n\nAlternatively, the 6 would propagate to the next rows, but where there are 3s (background), replacing them with 6s. The 0s would remain.\n\nSo the output for the test input would have the 6 moving down and to the right each row. For example:\n\nRow5, column3: 6\n\nRow6, column4: 6 (but the input has a 0 there, so maybe the 6 can't overwrite 0. So perhaps only moves into background cells (3s). So row6, column4 is 0, so the 6 can't go there. Then maybe it moves to the next available cell. So perhaps the 6 would move down and to the right, skipping the 0s.\n\nAlternatively, the propagation is only into background cells. So the non-background number (6) can only move into cells that are background (3). If the cell is occupied by a 0 or another number, it can't move there.\n\nSo in the test input, the 6 is at row5, column3. The cell below and to the right (row6, column4) is 0, so it can't move there. Then perhaps the 6 moves down and to the right as much as possible. Let's see:\n\nRow5, column3: 6.\n\nNext possible move is to row6, column4 (0, blocked). So maybe the 6 can't move there. Then what? Maybe it moves down and to the right past the 0. So row6, column5 is 3 (background), so the 6 could move there. But how does the direction work.\n\nAlternatively, the 6 can move down and to the right, but if that cell is blocked, it tries to move right or down. But this is getting into pathfinding, which seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, the non-background number spreads to all possible directions (down, left, right, etc.), but only into background cells. So the 6 would spread to adjacent cells in the next row that are 3s. But in example0, the 2 spreads to the left and right in the next row.\n\nBut in example0's input, the 2 is at row5, column6. The next row (row6), columns5 and7 are 8s (background), so the 2 can spread there. So in the output, those are replaced with 2s. Then in row7, the 2s spread to columns6 and8, which are 8s. And so on.\n\nSo the rule might be: For each cell (i,j) with a non-background number, in the output, check the cell below and to the left (i+1, j-1) and below and to the right (i+1, j+1). If those cells are background, replace them with the non-background number.\n\nThis would create a V-shape spreading downward.\n\nIn example0, the 2 in (5,6) would create 2s in (6,5) and (6,7). Then those 2s would create 2s in (7,4) and (7,6) for the left one, and (7,6) and (7,8) for the right one. But in example0's output, row7 has 2s at6 and8. So only the rightward spread is happening. So maybe the rule is to spread to the right only.\n\nAlternatively, the non-background number spreads to the cell directly below and to the right (i+1, j+1). So example0's 2 in (5,6) would move to (6,7), then (7,8), etc. But the output shows 2s in (6,5 and7), which contradicts this.\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the pattern is that each non-background number (except 0) spawns a new number to the right in the next row. So for each row, if there's a non-background number at (i,j), then in row i+1, j+1, place that number. So for example0's 2 at (5,6), row6 would have 2 at7, row7 at8, etc. But example0's output shows 2 at (6,5 and7). So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are moving down and to the left and right based on some rule, but the training examples are too few to find a clear pattern. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should look for a pattern that fits all examples and apply it to the test input.\n\nGiven that in example0, the 2 spawns two 2s in the next row, then those each spawn two more, but the example output shows them moving right. For the test input's 6, perhaps it would spawn two 6s in the next row, left and right, then those each spawn two more, creating a V-shape. But considering the 0s in the test input may block some positions.\n\nThe test input's 6 is in row5, column3. The next row (row6) has a 0 at column4 and6. So the 6 could spawn to column2 and4 in row6. But column4 is a 0, which is static. So only column2 in row6 would get a 6. Then row7 would have 6 at column1 and3 (from the 6 at row6, column2). But column3 in row7 is a 0 (from the test input's row7, column5 is 0, but row7, column3 is 3). Wait, the test input's row7 is [3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3...]. So column5 is 0, but column3 is 3. So the 6 from row6, column2 could spawn to row7, column1 and3. Column3 is background (3), so it can be replaced. Then in row8, the 6s would spread further.\n\nAlternatively, if the 6 spawns to the left and right each row, but avoiding 0s, the output would have a V-shape of 6s starting from row5, column3 and spreading left and right each row, but avoiding the 0s.\n\nBut how to format this into the output.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in example1's 3, the output shows the 3s spreading left and right each row, forming a diamond. So for the test input's 6, perhaps the 6 would spread in a similar way, but in the presence of 0s.\n\nBut the test input has 0s in rows6,7,8. So the 6's spread would have to avoid those positions.\n\nAlternatively, the 6 would move down and to the right, creating a diagonal, but the 0s would block some paths. For example, the 6 in row5, column3 would move to row6, column4 (which is 0), so it can't. So it moves to row6, column5 (which is 3). Then row7, column6 (which is0), can't. So move to row7, column7 (3), etc. But this requires checking each step.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the pattern that non-background numbers propagate down and to the right, creating a diagonal. For the test input, the 6 would start at row5, column3. Then each subsequent row, the 6 moves down and right. However, row6, column4 is 0 (blocked), so the 6 can't go there. So it might move to the next available cell. But without knowing the exact rule, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the propagation is not affected by the 0s. The 0s are part of the background and are treated like any other number. So the 6 would overwrite the 0s. But in example0, the 0s are preserved, so the non-background numbers can't overwrite 0s.\n\nGiven that, the 6 would propagate down and right, but only into background cells (3s). So the 6's path would be:\n\nRow5, column3 \u2192 row6, column4 (0, blocked) \u2192 can't go there. So maybe the 6 can't propagate further. But that would mean no output change, which doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the propagation is not blocked by 0s. The 0s are part of the input and output. So the 6 would overwrite the 0s. But in example0, the 0s are preserved. So this is not the case.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll make an educated guess based on example0 and example1.\n\nIn example0, the 2 propagates down and to the right, creating a diagonal. In example1, the 3 spreads outwards in a diamond. In example2, the 8 moves upwards. So maybe the direction is determined by the number's value:\n\n- Even numbers (like 2, 8) move down-right (2) or up-right (8).\n\n- Odd numbers (like 3) spread outwards in a diamond.\n\nFor the test input's 6 (even), it should move down-right. But the test input has a 6 in row5, column3. So:\n\nRow5, column3 \u2192 row6, column4 (0, blocked). So maybe it moves to row6, column5 (3, background), then row7, column6 (0, blocked), then row8, column7 (3). So the 6 would appear in row6, column5; row7, column7 (blocked by 0 in row7, column5?), etc.\n\nThis is unclear. Given the time, I'll proceed with the assumption that even numbers move down-right, and odd numbers spread out. So the test input's 6 (even) would move down-right, creating a diagonal of 6s. But the 0s in row6, column4 and row7, column5 may block this path. So the 6 may only appear in row6, column5 (if allowed).\n\nAlternatively, the 6's path would be:\n\nRow5:3,3,3,6,3...\n\nRow6:3,3,3,3,0,6...\n\nRow7:3,3,3,3,3,0,6...\n\nRow8:3,3,3,3,0,3,0,6...\n\nBut this is just a guess. Alternatively, the 6 would continue moving down-right, ignoring the 0s. So row6, column4 (0) would be replaced by 6, row7, column5 (0) replaced by6, etc. But this contradicts example0 where 0s are preserved.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll proceed with the pattern observed in example0 and example1 where non-background numbers propagate down and to the right, creating a diagonal. Applying this to the test input, the 6 would create a diagonal starting at row5, column3. Each subsequent row, the 6 would appear one column to the right and one row down. But if the path is blocked by 0s, the 6 may not appear there. However, based on example0, the 0s are preserved, so the 6 can't overwrite them. So the 6 would continue propagating down-right where possible.\n\nBut how to handle blocked paths. Maybe the 6 would skip the blocked cells and continue. So:\n\nRow5: column3 \u2192 row6: column4 (0, so skipped) \u2192 row6, column5 (3, allowed) \u2192 row7: column6 (0, skipped) \u2192 row7, column7 (3, allowed) \u2192 etc.\n\nSo the 6 would appear in row6, column5; row7, column7; row8, column9; etc.\n\nBut this is speculative. The final answer would need to show the 6 propagating in this manner.\n\nAfter considering all possibilities, the safest pattern to apply is that each non-background number (other than 0) propagates down and to the right, creating a diagonal line. Thus, the 6 in the test input would move down and right each row, resulting in 6s appearing in subsequent rows and columns. Given the test input's 0s, the 6 would bypass them when possible.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to figure out the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by carefully analyzing the examples provided.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 0. The input has a lot of 8s. The output seems to have added some 2s in a diagonal or stepped pattern. Let me look closer. The input has a 0 in the fourth row, fifth element. Then in the fifth row, there's 0, 8, 0. Then the sixth row has an 8, 0, 8, 2. The output's lower rows show 2s spreading out diagonally. Maybe the 2s are propagating downward and to the sides from the original 2? Wait, there's a 2 in the input's sixth row. Then in the output, the rows below have 2s arranged diagonally. So perhaps when there's a certain number (like 2 here), it starts a pattern where each subsequent row shifts the 2s to the right and left, creating a diagonal effect.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 3 in the seventh row, fifth element. The output shows that this 3 causes a spread of 3s in the rows below, creating a kind of triangle or diamond shape. The rows after the 3 start to form 3s in a pattern that expands and then contracts. For instance, row 8 has three 3s, then the next rows have 3s alternating, maybe like a wave spreading out from the initial 3.\n\nExample 2 is a bit more complex. The input has some 0s and an 8. The output shows that the 8 in the input's fifth row, twelfth element leads to some 8s and 4s in the output. The 8 seems to create a pattern where adjacent elements (like next columns) also become 8s, but only in certain rows. Also, the 0s might not change, but the 8 is propagating in some way. Maybe the rule involves numbers higher than the surrounding ones propagating downwards or to the sides?\n\nLooking for common elements across the examples, it seems that when a number (like 2, 3, 8) is present in the input, it creates a pattern where subsequent rows below it have that number spreading out. The mechanism might involve each such number acting as a seed, and in each subsequent row, the number is placed to the left and right of the position below the original, creating a diagonal spread. Also, the presence of 0s might indicate that they are fixed points or block the spread, as in example 0 where the 0s are in the same positions in the input and output.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 in the sixth row, seventh column (assuming rows are zero-indexed) leads to the next row having 2s at positions 5 and 7, then next row 6 and 8, and so on. So each time, the 2s are moving left and right by one each row down. Similarly, in Example 1, the 3 in the seventh row, fifth column leads to the next rows having 3s spreading out left and right each row. So perhaps the rule is that any number that is not 0 or the background number (like 8, 1, 4 in the examples) acts as a seed, and in each subsequent row, it generates instances of itself to the left and right, creating a V shape or diagonal lines.\n\nBut wait, the background numbers (like 8, 1, 4) in the input seem to stay the same unless affected by a seed. The seeds (like 2,3,8) start spreading. But how do they interact with existing numbers? For example, in Example 0, the original 8s remain unless a 2 propagates into their position. Similarly, in Example 2, the 8 in the input leads to 8s in the output, replacing some 4s.\n\nSo the pattern might be: For each number that is not 0 and not the background value (the majority value in the input), it starts a propagation where each subsequent row adds that number to the left and right positions below it, creating two new instances each row. This would form a diamond or V shape expanding downwards. The 0s might block this propagation, or perhaps they are ignored.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the initial 3 is in row 7 (if rows are 0-indexed). The output rows below it have 3s spreading. Let's count the rows. The input for Example 1 has 13 rows. The output's row 8 (assuming starting from 0) has 3,3,3. Then row 9: 3,1,3. Row 10: 3,3,3 again? Wait, the output for Example 1 shows:\n\nRow 8: 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, ... \nRow 9: 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, ...\nRow 10: 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, ...\nRow 11: 3, 1, 3, 1, ...\nRow 12: 3, 3, 1, ...\n\nHmm, maybe the 3s are spreading outward each row, creating a diamond pattern. Each step, the 3s are placed one position left and right from the previous positions. So from a single 3 in row 7, column 4 (assuming rows start at 0), the next row (8) has columns 3,4,5 as 3s. Then row 9 would have columns 2,4,6 (but in the example, row 9 is [1,1,3,1,3,1, ...], so columns 2 and 4 are 3). Then row 10: columns 1,3,5, etc. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me check the example's output:\n\nExample 1's output:\n\nAfter the initial 3 in row 7 (input's row 7, which is row index 7?), the output rows are:\n\nRow 8 (output): [1,1,1,1,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\nRow 9: [1,1,3,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\nRow 10: [1,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\nRow 11: [3,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\nRow 12: [3,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nSo row 8 has 3s in columns 4,5,6 (assuming 0-based). Then row 9 has 3s in 2,4. Row 10 has 1,3,3,3. Wait, this is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the 3 in row 7, column 4 (input) starts a pattern where each next row, the 3s spread out in a diamond shape. So the first row after (row 8) has 3s at positions 3,4,5 (columns). Then row 9 has 2,4,6. Row 10 has 1,3,5,7. But that doesn't exactly match. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are moving left and right, but each time, the leftmost and rightmost positions are added. So from a single 3, the next row has 3s to the left and right. Then the next row adds another layer. But perhaps in Example 1, the presence of 0s might interfere. Wait, the input in Example 1 has some 0s in rows 5 and 6. The 3 is in row 7, column 4. The output's row 8 (the next row) has three 3s starting at column 4. Maybe the 3s are propagating downward, and each step, they spread to adjacent cells, but the existing 0s or 1s determine if they can be replaced. But in the output, the 3s replace the 1s in their path.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is: For any non-zero number that is not the background value (the majority value in the input), when it appears in a row, it will generate two copies of itself in the next row, one to the left and one to the right. This creates a diamond or pyramid pattern expanding downward. The 0s are fixed and do not change. The background numbers (like 8,1,4 in the examples) are replaced by the propagating number if the propagation reaches their position.\n\nSo, in the test input, the background is 3s. The input has a 6 in row 5, column 3 (assuming rows are 0-indexed). Then in row 6, there are 0s at columns 4 and 6. Then row 7 has a 0 at column 5. And rows 8 has 0s again. So the 6 is the non-background number here (since the rest are 3s and 0s). According to the pattern, the 6 should start propagating downward, creating 6s in the rows below, each time spreading left and right. However, the 0s might block the propagation. Let's see.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nRow 5: [3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow 6: [3,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow 7: [3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow 8: [3,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n...\n\nThe 6 is in row 5, column 3. So according to the pattern, the next row (row 6) should have 6s at columns 2 and 4 (left and right of 3). But row 6's column 4 is a 0. So perhaps the 0 blocks the propagation. Therefore, in row 6, the 6 would try to create 6s at columns 2 and 4, but since column 4 is 0, it can't. So only column 2 would get a 6. But in the output, would that happen? Let me check the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2 in row 5 (input) leads to row 6 (output) having 2s at positions 5 and 7. Then row 7 has 6 and 8. So each step, the 2s are placed left and right. The presence of 0s in the input's row 4 and 5 don't block because they are in different positions. Wait, perhaps the 0s in the same column as the propagation path block. For example, in the test input, row 6, column 4 is 0. So if the 6 in row 5, column 3 propagates to column 2 and 4 in row 6. Column 4 is 0, so that spot remains 0. So only column 2 would become 6. But since the input's row 6, column 4 is 0, the output for row 6, column 4 would remain 0, but column 2 would be 6. Then, in row 7, the 6 in column 2 would propagate to columns 1 and 3. Column 3 in row 7 is 3 (background), so it would turn into 6. Then row 8 would have the 6s propagating further.\n\nBut wait, the test input's row 6 has 0s in columns 4 and 6. So the initial propagation from the 6 in row 5 would attempt to place 6s in columns 2 and 4. But column 4 is 0, so that 0 remains. Column 2 is 3 (background), so it changes to 6. So row 6 in the output would have a 6 in column 2. Then, in row 7, the 6 in column 2 would propagate to columns 1 and 3. Both of these are 3s, so they become 6s. Then row 8 would have columns 0, 2, 4 (since from column 1 and 3). But wait, let's step through this.\n\nRow 5: column 3 is 6.\nRow 6: columns 2 and 4 would be 6. But column 4 is 0 in the input, so output's column 4 remains 0. Only column 2 becomes 6.\nRow 6 output: [3,3,6,3,0,3,0,...]\n\nThen, row 6's 6 at column 2 would propagate to columns 1 and 3 in row 7.\nRow 7 input has column 5 as 0, but columns 1 and 3 are 3s. So in row 7 output, columns 1 and 3 become 6.\nRow 7 output: [3,6,3,6,3,0,3,...]\n\nThen, row 7's 6s at columns 1 and 3 would propagate to columns 0 and 2 (from column 1), and 2 and 4 (from column 3).\nSo in row 8, columns 0,2,4 would be 6s. But checking the input row 8, columns 4 is 0. So in row 8, column 4 would be 0 (from input) unless the propagation overwrites it. Wait, the input's row 8 has [3,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,...]. So column 4 is 0. The propagation from column 3 (which is now 6 in row 7) would try to set column 4 in row 8 to 6. But the input has 0 there. But in the training examples, like Example 0, the 0s in the input are preserved. So perhaps the 0s are fixed, and the propagation can't overwrite them. Therefore, in row 8, column 4 remains 0. So the propagation from column 3 would set column 2 and 4. Column 2 is 3 (background), so becomes 6. Column 4 is 0, so remains 0. Similarly, the propagation from column 1 (6 in row 7) would set columns 0 and 2. So row 8 would have columns 0 (from column 1's left) and 2 (from both column 1's right and column 3's left). So columns 0 and 2 become 6. Column 4 remains 0.\n\nContinuing this way, each row's 6s would propagate left and right, but any position with a 0 in the input remains 0.\n\nSo applying this to the test input, starting from the 6 in row 5, column 3. The output would have 6s propagating downward in a diamond pattern, but 0s in the input would block the propagation in those positions.\n\nNow, let's look at the test input's structure. The 6 is in row 5 (assuming the first row is 0), and the input's rows 6,7,8 have 0s that may interfere.\n\nThe test input's rows:\n\nRow 5: [3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow 6: [3,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow 7: [3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\nRow 8: [3,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n...\n\nThe 0s in row 6 (columns 4 and 6), row 7 (column 5), row 8 (columns 4 and 6).\n\nSo the 6 in row 5, column 3 would first affect row 6, columns 2 and 4. But column 4 is 0, so only column 2 becomes 6.\n\nRow 6 output: [3,3,6,3,0,3,0,3,...]\n\nThen row 6's column 2 (6) would propagate to row 7's columns 1 and 3. Both are 3s, so they become 6.\n\nRow 7 output: [3,6,3,6,3,0,3,3,...]\n\nThen row 7's columns 1 and 3 (6s) propagate to row 8's columns 0,2 (from column 1) and 2,4 (from column 3). So columns 0 and 2 would be 6s, but column 4 is 0 in the input. So:\n\nRow 8 output: [6,3,6,3,0,3,0,3,...]\n\nNext, row 8's columns 0 and 2 (6s) would propagate to row 9's columns -1 and 1 (but column -1 doesn't exist) from column 0, and columns 1 and 3 from column 2. So only column 1 and 3 become 6. But column 0 is at the edge, so maybe column 0's left is out of bounds. So row 9 would get 6s in columns 1 and 3.\n\nRow 9: [6,6,3,6,3,3,3,...]\n\nContinuing this, the 6s spread outward each row, creating a V shape. But whenever they hit a 0 in the input, those positions remain 0.\n\nAdditionally, the test input's row 8 has 0s in columns 4 and 6. But after propagation, those may get 6s only if the propagation path reaches there, but the input's 0s would block that.\n\nPutting it all together, the output for the test input would have 6s spreading down from the initial position in row 5, column 3, creating a diamond pattern that's modified by the 0s present in the input rows. Each subsequent row would have 6s to the left and right of the previous positions, except where there's a 0 in the input.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nThe initial 6 is in row 5, column 3.\n\nRow 5 output: same as input except the 6 remains.\n\nRow 6: columns 2 and 4 would be 6, but column 4 is 0, so row 6 becomes [3,3,6,3,0,3,0,...].\n\nRow 7: columns 1 and 3 (from row 6's 6 at column 2) become 6. So row 7 is [3,6,3,6,3,0,3,...].\n\nRow 8: from row 7's 6s at columns 1 and 3, propagate to columns 0,2 and 2,4. Columns 0 becomes 6, 2 becomes 6, but column 4 is 0. So row 8: [6,3,6,3,0,3,0, ...].\n\nRow 9: from row 8's 6s at 0 and 2. Column 0 propagates to -1 (invalid) and 1. Column 2 propagates to 1 and 3. So columns 1 and 3 become 6. So row 9: [6,6,3,6, ...].\n\nRow 10: from row 9's 6s at 1 and 3. Column 1 propagates to 0 and 2. Column 3 propagates to 2 and 4. So columns 0, 2,4. But row 10's input has no 0s in these positions. So row 10 becomes [6,3,6,3,6, ...].\n\nContinuing this pattern, each subsequent row would spread the 6s further left and right. However, the 0s in the input rows (like row 6, 8, etc.) remain 0 in the output.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the output rows after the initial seed show the propagation. So applying this to the test input, the output should have the 6s spreading downward in a diamond pattern, with the 0s blocking their positions.\n\nNow, translating this into the actual array outputs. The test input has 18 rows. The initial 6 is in row 5. The propagation would affect rows 6 to 17. Let's try to model this step by step.\n\nRow 5 (input):\n[3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 5 (output) remains the same, as the seed is there.\n\nRow 6 (input has 0s at columns 4 and 6):\n[3,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 6 output:\n[3,3,6,3,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 7 (input has 0 at column 5):\n[3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 7 output:\n[3,6,3,6,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 8 (input has 0s at 4 and 6):\n[3,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 8 output:\n[6,3,6,3,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 9 (input is all 3s except for 0s elsewhere):\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 9 output:\n[6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 10:\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 10 output:\n[6,3,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 11:\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 11 output:\n[3,6,3,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 12:\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 12 output:\n[6,3,6,3,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nAnd so on, each time the 6s spread further left and right, creating a V shape. However, since the input has no 0s beyond row 8 (except for rows 6,7,8), the propagation continues.\n\nBut wait, the test input has 18 rows. The initial seed is in row 5. The propagation would continue until the last row, so each row after 5 will have more 6s added based on the previous row's positions.\n\nNow, putting this into the output format, each row of the output is the same as the input except where the propagation occurs. The background 3s are replaced by 6s in the propagated positions.\n\nSo the final output for the test input would have the 6s spreading downward from row 5, creating a diamond shape, with 0s remaining in their original positions.\n\nThe final answer should follow the same structure as the training examples, showing each row as a list with the propagated 6s.",
