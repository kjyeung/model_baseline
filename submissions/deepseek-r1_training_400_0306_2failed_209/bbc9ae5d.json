        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is an array of numbers followed by zeros. The output seems to be multiple arrays where each subsequent array has one more of the initial non-zero elements.\n\nFor example, in Example 0, the input is [1,1,0,0,0,0]. The output starts with the same array, then adds a 1 in the third position, then another in the fourth. Wait, but the first output is the same as the input. Then the next line adds a 1 to the next position. So the number of steps might be determined by how many non-zero elements there are initially. Wait, in Example 0, the input has two 1s. The outputs have 2, then 3, then 4 elements. Wait, no, the output arrays have the first two as 1s, then each step adds one more 1. But the initial input in Example 0 is [1,1,0,0,0,0], so two non-zero elements. The outputs are three arrays where the first is the original, then adding one more 1 each time. The number of outputs seems to be equal to the number of non-zero elements. Wait, no: Example 0 has two non-zero elements, but the output has three lines. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nLooking at Example 1: Input is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output has four lines. The initial non-zero elements are just one (the first element is 2, the rest are 0). The outputs start with the original, then add 2s in the next positions. So the outputs are 1, 2, 3, 4 elements of 2s. Wait, input starts with [2,0,...], output lines are [2,0,...], then [2,2,0,...], then [2,2,2,0,...], then [2,2,2,2,0...]. So the number of output lines seems to be equal to the count of the first non-zero element's consecutive occurrences? Wait, in Example 0, the input starts with two 1s. The outputs are three lines, each adding one more 1. So initial count is 2, then outputs 2,3,4? So the number of output lines is initial count +1? Wait no: Example 0 has initial 2 1s, outputs have 3 lines. So 3 lines. 2+1=3. Example1 has initial 1 non-zero element (the 2), outputs 4 lines. So 1+3? Not sure. Wait, maybe the number of outputs is the initial count of the first element's consecutive same numbers. Let's check:\n\nExample 0: input starts with two 1s. Output has three lines. The outputs start with two 1s, then three, then four. So the outputs increase by one each time. The number of lines is 3. So maybe the number of lines is equal to the number of initial consecutive same elements. Wait, the initial consecutive elements are two (two 1s). Outputs have three lines. So 2+1=3. Maybe the number of output lines is the count of consecutive elements plus one minus... Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3: input is [8,8,8,8,0,0]. The outputs have three lines. The initial count of consecutive 8s is 4. The outputs are 4, 5, 6 8s. Wait, but three lines. So 4, then 5, then 6. So how many steps? The initial 4, and each step adds one until the array is filled. But in the output, the first line is the original, then each next line adds one more. So the number of lines is (length of the array) minus (number of trailing zeros) divided by the step? Or perhaps the number of lines is the number of consecutive non-zero elements in the input. Wait, in Example 0, the consecutive non-zero elements are two. The outputs are three lines. Example 3 has four consecutive 8s, outputs three lines. Wait, that doesn't fit. Wait example 3's output has three lines. Original has four 8s, then next lines add one each, so 4,5,6. But the array length is 6. So the last line is six 8s. So the number of lines is (array length) minus the original non-zero count plus 1? For example, in example 3, original non-zero is 4, array length 6. 6-4=2, plus 1 gives 3 lines. That matches. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 0: array length 6, original non-zero count 2. 6-2=4, plus 1 is 5, which doesn't match. Wait no. The outputs for Example 0 are three lines. So 6-2=4, not matching. Hmm. Maybe the number of lines is the number of non-zero elements in the input. Wait, in Example 1, input has one non-zero element (the 2), outputs have four lines. So that doesn't fit. Example 4: input is [7,0,0,0,0,0], so one non-zero. Outputs are three lines. So perhaps not.\n\nAnother approach: For each example, the outputs are generated by starting with the input array, then each subsequent array increases the number of the initial same elements by one until the array is filled. The number of outputs depends on how many steps it takes to fill the array from the initial count.\n\nWait in Example 0: input is [1,1,0,0,0,0]. The initial count is two 1s. The outputs are three lines: the first is the original, then the next adds one 1 (now three), then another (four). But the array is length 6. Wait, but in the third output line, it's [1,1,1,1,0,0], which only has four 1s. So they didn't fill the array. Hmm. Wait, maybe the number of outputs is equal to the initial number of non-zero elements. Example 0: two 1s, three outputs. No, that's 3. Example1 has one non-zero, outputs four. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the outputs are generated by taking the initial sequence of identical numbers and extending it by one in each step, until the entire array is filled. But in Example 0, initial two 1s. The outputs are adding one 1 each time until the array is filled with 1s. Wait, but in the third output line, it's four 1s. The array length is 6, so maybe they continue until the array is filled. But in Example0's output, there are three lines. So in each step, the number of 1s increases by one. Starting at two, then three, then four. But why stop at four? Because the array is of length 6. Hmm. So that would require 6-2=4 steps? But that's not matching.\n\nWait maybe the pattern is that the number of output lines is equal to the number of consecutive same elements in the input. Let's check:\n\nExample 0: input starts with two 1s. Output has three lines. So 2+1=3.\n\nExample1: input starts with one 2. Output has four lines. 1+3=4?\n\nHmm, not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at each example's input and output lines.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nInput is [1,1,0,0,0,0]. The outputs are three arrays. Each next array has one more 1 than the previous. The initial count is two, then three, then four. So the outputs are sequences where the number of 1s increases by one each time. The maximum number of 1s in the outputs is four. The array length is six, but the outputs stop at four 1s. So why? Maybe the number of outputs is equal to the initial count of the consecutive same elements. Wait, initial count is two. Outputs have three lines. So perhaps initial count +1? But then in Example1, initial count is one (the first element is 2, then zeros). Outputs have four lines. 1+3=4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example3: input is four 8s. Outputs have three lines. So 4,5,6 8s. The array length is six. So from 4 to 6, that's three steps (4,5,6). So the number of outputs is the array length minus the initial count plus 1. 6-4=2, 2+1=3. So that gives three lines. Let's check Example0: array length 6, initial count 2. 6-2=4, 4+1=5. But the outputs are three lines, so that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not it.\n\nWait maybe the number of outputs is the initial count. Example0: count 2, outputs 3. No. Example3: count 4, outputs 3. Not matching. Example1: count 1, outputs 4. Not.\n\nAlternatively, the number of outputs is equal to the initial count of the consecutive elements. So in Example0, two 1s, three outputs. Hmm, no. Maybe the initial count plus the number of trailing zeros divided by the count. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: All the outputs start with the input array. Then each subsequent line adds one more element of the same value as the initial elements. For example, in Example0, the first line is the input. Then next line, third element becomes 1. Then fourth. So each step increases the length of the initial run by one. The process continues until all zeros are filled. Wait, but in Example0's outputs, the last line is [1,1,1,1,0,0]. So after four 1s, but the array is length 6, so there are still two zeros. So why stop there?\n\nWait, looking at the outputs of the examples:\n\nExample0:\n\n[1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,0,0]\n\nSo three outputs. The initial run is 2, then adds one each time until it's 4. So the outputs are for runs of 2, 3, 4. So the number of outputs is 3. 4-2 +1=3? Because 4-2=2, 2+1=3. So the run increases from initial to initial + (number of outputs -1). Hmm.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nInput is [2,0,...]. The outputs are runs of 1,2,3,4. So four outputs, initial run 1, then 2,3,4. So the number of outputs is 4. How does that come?\n\nThe array length is 8. The initial run is 1. So maybe the maximum possible run is 8. But in the outputs, the runs go up to 4. So why?\n\nWait, the outputs in Example1 are:\n\n[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo four outputs. The runs are 1,2,3,4. So the number of outputs is 4. So how is 4 determined? The input starts with 1 element. The outputs add one each time until the run is 4. So why stop at 4? The array length is 8, so maybe the maximum run is 4. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the number of outputs is the initial run count plus 3. 1+3=4. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Looking for the maximum run length in the outputs.\n\nIn Example0, the maximum run is 4 (from initial 2). So 4-2=2 steps, so three outputs (including initial). In Example1, the maximum run is 4 (from initial 1). 4-1=3 steps, four outputs. Example3: initial run 4, max run 6. 6-4=2 steps, three outputs. Example4: input is [7,0,0,0,0,0]. Outputs are [7,0...], [7,7,0...], [7,7,7,0...]. So initial run 1, then 2, then 3. Three outputs. So 3 steps. The array length is 6, but max run is 3. So how's that determined?\n\nWait, perhaps the number of outputs is determined by the initial count of the consecutive elements. Like, if the input starts with N consecutive elements, then the outputs have N+1 steps. Wait, Example0: N=2, outputs 3 (2+1). Example1: N=1, outputs 4 (1+3). No. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of outputs is the same as the initial count. But Example0: 2 initial, 3 outputs. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs for each example:\n\nExample0: 3 outputs\n\nExample1:4\n\nExample2:5\n\nExample3:3\n\nExample4:3\n\nThe input for Example2 is [5,5,5,0,...]. The outputs are 5 lines. The initial count is 3. So 3,4,5,6,7. Wait, the first output is [5,5,5,0...], then next adds one more 5 each time. The outputs have 5 lines. Let's check:\n\nFirst line: 3 fives.\n\nSecond:4\n\nThird:5\n\nFourth:6\n\nFifth:7.\n\nBut the array has 10 elements. So the last line would have seven 5s followed by three zeros. But according to the output given in Example2, the last line is [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0]. So seven 5s. So the outputs are 5 lines. So from initial 3, each line adds one, up to seven. So steps: 3,4,5,6,7. That's five steps. So 7-3=4 steps, plus 1 equals 5 outputs.\n\nSo for Example2, initial run 3, max run 7. 7-3 +1=5 outputs. But how is 7 determined? Array length is 10. So maybe the initial run plus the number of trailing zeros. Let's see: initial run is 3, followed by 7 zeros. So initial run plus trailing zeros is 3+7=10. So the maximum run could be the sum of the initial run and the trailing zeros? Wait, no. Because 3+7=10, but the max run in the output is 7. So that doesn't add up. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum run is the initial run plus the number of trailing zeros. But in Example0: initial run 2, trailing zeros 4. So 2+4=6. But the max run in output is 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: The outputs are generated by adding one element to the initial run until the run is twice the initial count. Let's check:\n\nExample0: initial 2. Twice would be 4. So three outputs (2,3,4). Yes.\n\nExample1: initial 1. Twice would be 2. But outputs go up to 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: The outputs are such that the initial run increases by one each time until the entire array is filled with that number, but only up to a certain point. Wait, in Example3, the input is [8,8,8,8,0,0]. The array length is 6. The initial run is 4. The outputs have three lines: 4,5,6. So here, the run increases until it fills the array. So 4,5,6. So the number of outputs is 6-4=2 steps, plus the initial one. So 3 outputs. That makes sense.\n\nExample0: initial run 2, array length 6. So 6-2=4 steps. But the outputs only have 3 steps. So that doesn't fit. Wait, the outputs in Example0 are [2,3,4] elements. So 2, then 3, then4. That's three steps, but array length is 6. Why not go to 6?\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is to take the number of consecutive elements in the input and add as many steps as there are consecutive elements. For example, input has two consecutive elements (like Example0), then add two steps. So two consecutive elements gives three outputs (original, plus two more). So in Example0, three outputs. Let's check:\n\nExample0: two consecutive, three outputs.\n\nExample1: one consecutive, four outputs. So 1+3=4? Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of outputs is the number of consecutive elements in the input. Example0: two consecutive, three outputs. Not.\n\nAlternatively, the outputs are the initial run, then increasing by one each step until the run is the same as the first element's value. For example, in Example0, the first element is 1. So run increases to 1? No, that doesn't fit. Example1's first element is 2. Run increases to 2? But in Example1's outputs, the run goes up to 4. So that's not.\n\nAnother angle: All the outputs start with the same elements as the input. Then, each subsequent line adds one more of the same number as the initial elements until the number of elements equals the first number in the array. Wait, for Example0, first number is 1. The outputs go up to 4 elements. So that's not matching.\n\nWait in Example4, input is [7,0,0,0,0,0]. The outputs are three lines. The initial run is 1, then 2, then 3. So 3 outputs. The first element is 7, so maybe the run increases up to 7. But in this case, the array length is 6, so maximum run possible is 6. But the outputs stop at 3. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's try to find another pattern. Let's look at the number of outputs per example:\n\nExample0: 3 outputs\n\nExample1:4\n\nExample2:5\n\nExample3:3\n\nExample4:3\n\nWhat do the inputs have in common here?\n\nExample0 input: [1,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 2 leading 1s, then zeros.\n\nNumber of outputs:3 \u2192 which is 2+1=3.\n\nExample1 input: [2,0,...] \u2192 1 leading 2.\n\nOutputs:4 \u2192 1+3=4.\n\nExample2 input: [5,5,5,0...] \u21923 leading 5s.\n\nOutputs:5 \u21923+2=5.\n\nExample3 input:4 leading 8s. Outputs:3 \u21924-1=3.\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, the number of outputs is equal to the number of trailing zeros. Wait, in Example0, trailing zeros are 4. Outputs 3. Example1 has 7 trailing zeros. Outputs4. Not matching.\n\nAnother thought: The outputs represent the initial run expanding one by one, but the number of outputs is the original count of the initial run. So for Example0, count is 2, outputs 3. No.\n\nAlternatively, the outputs are generated by adding one element each time until the run length equals the value of the first element. For example, in Example0, first element is 1. So run length reaches 1. But the output has runs up to 4. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the outputs are generated by taking the initial run and creating a sequence where each next step adds one element until the number of elements in the run is equal to the original run plus the number of trailing zeros. For example, in Example0: original run 2, trailing zeros 4. 2+4=6. So run increases up to 6. But the output stops at 4. So that's not it.\n\nWait perhaps the pattern is to take the initial run and generate as many outputs as the initial run's value. For example, in Example0, initial run's value is 1 (the number), but outputs are three. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of outputs is the initial run's count plus one. For Example0:2+1=3. Example1:1+1=2. But outputs are4. No.\n\nAlternatively, the outputs are generated by expanding the initial run until it's the same as the first number. For example, in Example0: first number is 1. So initial run is 2. To reach 1? No. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let me try to look at another aspect. All the outputs have arrays where the non-zero part is expanding by one each time, starting from the initial input. The number of outputs seems to be determined by the length of the array minus the initial run length plus one.\n\nWait for Example0: array length 6, initial run 2. 6-2+1=5. But outputs are 3. Doesn't fit. Example1: array length 8, initial run1. 8-1+1=8. But outputs are4. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of outputs is the initial run's count. So for Example0:2 \u21923 outputs. No.\n\nWait, maybe the outputs are created by expanding the initial run until it reaches the sum of the initial run and the number of trailing zeros. For Example0: initial run 2, trailing zeros 4. 2+4=6. So expand until the run is 6. But the output stops at 4. So that's not.\n\nAlternative idea: The number of outputs is the number of trailing zeros plus one. For Example0: trailing zeros 4. 4+1=5. But outputs are3. No.\n\nWait looking at Example2: input has 3 leading 5s and 7 trailing zeros. Outputs are 5 lines. The initial run is 3, then each line adds one. The last output line has 7 5s. 3+4=7. So 4 steps, plus initial gives 5 outputs. So number of outputs is (7-3)+1=5. So 7 is the maximum run, which is the initial run plus the trailing zeros (3+7=10 elements in array). Wait, the array length is 10, initial run3, trailing zeros7. 3+7=10. The maximum run in outputs is 7, which is the initial run (3) plus the trailing zeros (7) minus 3 (since the trailing zeros are 7). Wait, 3+ (7-3) =7? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum run is the initial run plus the number of trailing zeros. But in Example0, initial run2, trailing zeros4. 2+4=6. The array length is6, so the maximum run possible is6. But the outputs stop at4. So why?\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nAnother approach: For each example, the outputs are the input array followed by arrays where the first occurrence of zero in the input is replaced by the initial number, then the next, and so on, for as many times as the initial number's count.\n\nWait, for example, Example0: initial two 1s. The first zero is the third element. So in the first output after the input, third element becomes 1. Then next output, fourth becomes 1. So how many times? That would be two times, but the example has three outputs including the input. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the number of outputs is the initial count plus the number of trailing zeros divided by something. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that each output line increases the number of initial elements by one until the number of elements reaches the value of the initial element multiplied by the count. For example, in Example0: initial elements are two 1s. 1*2=2. But the outputs go up to four 1s. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the initial number is the value, and the outputs expand until the count matches the value. For Example0: initial number 1, but output expands to four. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: The outputs are generated by adding one more element of the initial value each time, starting from the first zero after the initial run, and proceeding until the initial run's length is doubled. For Example0: initial run2. Double is4. So outputs three lines (original, 3,4). That matches. Example1: initial run1. Double is2. But outputs go up to4. So not. Example3: initial run4. Double is8, but the array length is6. So maximum possible is6. So outputs would be4,5,6. Which matches. Example4: initial run1. Double is2. But outputs go to3. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nSo maybe this pattern holds when the array is long enough. But in Example1, the array is length8, so doubling 1 would be2, but outputs go to4. So this idea is inconsistent.\n\nAt this point, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if there's a simple pattern. For each example, the outputs are the input array, then each next array has the same numbers as the input but with one more of the initial number added. The number of outputs depends on how many times you can add an element until you reach the array's length. Wait, for example, in Example0: input has two 1s. The array length is6. So you can add up to 4 more 1s (2+4=6). But in the outputs, they only add two more (up to4). So that's not the case.\n\nWait, looking at all examples:\n\nExample0: 2 initial, outputs up to 4.\n\nExample1:1 initial, up to4.\n\nExample2:3 initial, up to7.\n\nExample3:4 initial, up to6.\n\nExample4:1 initial, up to3.\n\nSo maybe the number of outputs is the initial count plus the number of trailing zeros divided by the initial count. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of outputs is the initial count plus one. For Example0, 2+1=3. Which matches. Example1:1+3=4. No. Not.\n\nAlternatively, the number of outputs is equal to the number of trailing zeros. Example0:4 trailing zeros. Outputs3. No.\n\nAnother Idea: Each output line increases the number of initial elements by one, starting from the initial count. The number of lines is equal to the number of trailing zeros in the input. For Example0: trailing zeros4. Outputs3. No. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the outputs as the input array, and then each subsequent array has the initial run extended by one element, until the initial run has been extended by a number of times equal to the initial count.\n\nExample0: initial count2. So extend twice. So the original (2), then +1 (3), +1 (4). So three outputs. Which matches.\n\nExample1: initial count1. Extend three times. So original (1), then +1 (2), +1 (3), +1 (4). Four outputs. Which matches.\n\nExample3: initial count4. Extend two times. Original (4), then 5, 6. Three outputs. Which matches.\n\nExample4: initial count1. Extend two times. Original (1), 2,3. Three outputs. Which matches.\n\nExample2: initial count3. Extend four times. So original (3),4,5,6,7. Five outputs. Which matches.\n\nYes! This seems to be the pattern. The number of outputs is equal to the initial count of the consecutive elements. Wait, no. Wait the number of extensions is equal to the initial count, so the total outputs are initial count +1. For Example0: initial count2. Extend two times, which gives 2+2=4 elements. Outputs: original (2), then 3,4. So three outputs. Which is initial count +1 (2+1=3). But for Example1: initial count1. Extend three times. So outputs:1,2,3,4. Which is 4 outputs. So initial count1 +3=4. But how to determine the number of extensions.\n\nAh! The number of extensions is equal to the initial count. For Example0: initial count2 \u2192 extend two times \u2192 outputs 3 (original plus two extensions). Example1: initial count1 \u2192 extend three times \u2192 outputs four (original plus three extensions). But why?\n\nWait, the pattern seems to be that the number of extensions (additional lines after the original input) is equal to the initial count. So the total outputs are initial count +1.\n\nBut looking at the examples:\n\nExample0: initial count2 \u2192 outputs3 \u2192 2+1=3.\n\nExample1: initial count1 \u2192 outputs4 \u2192 1+3=4. Not matching.\n\nWait this doesn't fit. So maybe the number of extensions is equal to the initial count. So the total outputs are extensions +1. For example:\n\nExample0: extensions=2 \u2192 outputs3 (2+1).\n\nExample1: extensions=3 \u2192 outputs4 (3+1).\n\nExample2: initial count3, outputs5 \u2192 extensions=4. 4+1=5.\n\nExample3: initial count4 \u2192 outputs3. So extensions=2 \u2192 2+1=3.\n\nExample4: initial count1 \u2192 outputs3 \u2192 extensions=2 \u2192 2+1=3.\n\nHmm, this seems inconsistent. So what determines the number of extensions?\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nExample0: initial count2 \u2192 extensions2 \u2192 outputs3.\n\nExample1: initial count1 \u2192 extensions3 \u2192 outputs4.\n\nExample2: initial count3 \u2192 extensions4 \u2192 outputs5.\n\nExample3: initial count4 \u2192 extensions2 \u2192 outputs3.\n\nExample4: initial count1 \u2192 extensions2 \u2192 outputs3.\n\nSo what's the pattern here for the number of extensions?\n\nLooking for a pattern between the initial count and the number of extensions:\n\nExample0: 2 \u21922.\n\nExample1:1 \u21923.\n\nExample2:3 \u21924.\n\nExample3:4 \u21922.\n\nExample4:1 \u21922.\n\nHmm. It's not obvious. But perhaps the number of extensions is the initial count's value. For example, in Example0, initial count2 \u2192 extensions2. Example2:3 \u21924. No, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of extensions is equal to the value of the elements. For Example0, elements are1 \u2192 extensions2. No. Example1: element is2 \u2192 extensions3. Hmm, 2+1=3. Example3: elements are8 \u2192 extensions2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother Idea: The number of extensions is determined by the number of trailing zeros. For example:\n\nExample0: trailing zeros4 \u2192 extensions2 (4/2=2).\n\nExample1: trailing zeros7 \u2192 extensions3 (7/2=3.5, rounded down).\n\nExample2: trailing zeros7 \u2192 extensions4 (7/1.75=4, but not sure).\n\nExample3: trailing zeros2 \u2192 extensions2 (2/1=2).\n\nExample4: trailing zeros5 \u2192 extensions2 (5/2.5=2).\n\nThis seems arbitrary. Not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the number of extensions is the minimum between the initial count and the number of trailing zeros. Example0: count2, trailing zeros4 \u2192 min(2,4)=2. Example1: count1, trailing7 \u2192 min(1,7)=1. But extensions are3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of extensions is the number of trailing zeros divided by the initial count. Example0:4/2=2 \u2192 extensions2. Example1:7/1=7 \u2192 extensions3. No. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. But based on the examples, the pattern seems to be that the number of outputs is equal to the initial count plus the number of trailing zeros divided by the initial count. Not sure.\n\nBut given that all examples show that each output line after the first adds one more element of the initial value, perhaps the rule is: take the input array, and for each output line, increase the number of consecutive initial elements by one, and the number of output lines is equal to the initial count plus one. But again, this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, the number of output lines is equal to the number of consecutive initial elements plus the number of trailing zeros. For Example0:2+4=6 \u2192 outputs3. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of output lines is the sum of the initial count and the value of the initial element. For Example0:2+1=3 \u2192 outputs3. Example1:1+2=3 \u2192 outputs4. No.\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Let's try to focus on the test input and see if I can apply what I observe.\n\nTest input is [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the initial run is three 1s. The array length is12. The trailing zeros are9.\n\nLooking at similar examples:\n\nExample2: input [5,5,5,0...], initial run3, outputs5 lines. So in that case, the outputs start with 3, then 4,5,6,7. So five lines. So the number of outputs is5. Which is initial run3 plus 2. Not sure.\n\nBut based on the examples, perhaps for the test input, the outputs would be:\n\nOriginal input: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThen each subsequent line adds one more 1. The number of outputs would be the initial count plus 2? For Example2, initial3, outputs5. So 3+2=5. For Example0, initial2, outputs3:2+1=3. Example1: initial1, outputs4:1+3=4. Hmm, this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the number of outputs is the initial count plus the number of trailing zeros divided by something. Example2: initial3, trailing7 zeros. 7/ something. 3+7=10, which is the array length. But outputs are5. Which is 3+ (7/1.4)=5. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the number of outputs is the initial count plus the trailing zeros divided by initial count. Example0: 4/2=2. 2+2=4. Outputs3. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of outputs is determined by the initial count multiplied by something. For Example0: 2 *1.5=3. Example1:1*4=4. Example2:3*1.666=5. Not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for the pattern in each example and see how the test input would fit.\n\nIn all examples, the outputs start with the input array, then each subsequent array increases the initial run by one element until the run has been extended by a certain number of steps. The number of steps seems to vary between examples. However, looking at the examples:\n\n- Example0: initial run 2 \u2192 outputs3 (steps of 2 increases: 2,3,4)\n- Example1: initial run1 \u2192 outputs4 (steps of3 increases:1,2,3,4)\n- Example2: initial run3 \u2192 outputs5 (steps of4 increases:3,4,5,6,7)\n- Example3: initial run4 \u2192 outputs3 (steps of2 increases:4,5,6)\n- Example4: initial run1 \u2192 outputs3 (steps of2 increases:1,2,3)\n\nSo the steps for each example are:\n\n- Example0: +2 \u2192 3 outputs\n- Example1: +3 \u21924 outputs\n- Example2: +4 \u21925 outputs\n- Example3: +2 \u21923 outputs\n- Example4: +2 \u21923 outputs\n\nThis is still inconsistent, but perhaps the steps are determined by the value of the initial element. For Example0: initial element1 \u2192 steps2. Example1: initial2 \u2192 steps3. Example2: initial5 \u2192 steps4. Example3: initial8 \u2192 steps2. Example4: initial7 \u2192 steps2. This doesn't seem to correlate.\n\nAlternatively, the steps are the value of the initial element. Example0:1 \u2192 steps2. No. Example1:2 \u2192 steps3. Maybe 2+1=3. Example3:8 \u2192 steps2. No.\n\nAlternatively, the steps are the number of trailing zeros divided by the initial count. For Example0:4/2=2. Steps2. Example1:7/1=7 \u2192 steps3. No.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the correct approach is to look for the following: the outputs are generated by adding one more element to the initial run until the number of elements in the run is equal to the sum of the initial run count and the value of the initial element.\n\nFor example:\n\nExample0: initial count2, value1. 2+1=3. So outputs until run reaches3. But the outputs go up to4. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1: initial count1, value2.1+2=3. So outputs until run3. But outputs go up to4.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother Idea: The number of outputs is the value of the initial element. Example0:1 \u21923 outputs. No.\n\nAlternatively, the value of the initial element plus the initial count. Example0:1+2=3. Which matches the three outputs. Example1:2+1=3. But outputs are4. No.\n\nHmm. Given the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for another pattern. Maybe the number of outputs is the initial count of consecutive elements plus one. For Example0:2+1=3. Example1:1+3=4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of outputs is determined by the first occurrence of zero. For example, in Example0, after the initial two 1s, the first zero is at index2. The number of outputs would be the array length minus the initial run. 6-2=4. But outputs are3. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of outputs is determined by the position of the first zero. For Example0, first zero at index2 (0-based). Outputs are3. 2+1=3. Example1: first zero at index1. Outputs4.1+3=4. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let's try to look at the test input.\n\nTest input is [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Initial run of three 1s, followed by nine zeros. Looking at similar examples:\n\nExample2: input [5,5,5,0...] with initial run3. Outputs are five lines, each adding one more 5. So original, then 4,5,6,7. Five lines. So initial run3, outputs5. So 3+2=5 steps. Hmm. How?\n\nExample2's array length is10. The initial run3, trailing zeros7. So how many steps? The outputs go up to7 5s, which is3+4=7. So the number of steps is4, which is trailing zeros7 minus initial run3? 7-3=4. Then 4+1=5 outputs. For the test input: trailing zeros9, initial run3. 9-3=6 steps. So outputs would be7 (3+6=9, but the array length is12. So initial run3, trailing zeros9. Adding 6 more 1s to the run. So outputs would be:\n\n[1,1,1,0,...]\n\n[1,1,1,1,0,...]\n\n...\n\nUntil the run is3+6=9. So the run becomes9, but array length is12. So 9+3 zeros. So the outputs would be from3 to9, each step adding one. So the number of outputs is9-3 +1=7. But according to Example2, initial run3, trailing zeros7, outputs5. Because7-3=4 steps plus the original. So 5 outputs. So applying this to the test case: trailing zeros9. 9-3=6 steps. So outputs6+1=7 lines.\n\nBut according to the examples:\n\nExample0: trailing zeros4, initial run2. 4-2=2 steps \u2192 outputs3. Which is correct.\n\nExample1: trailing zeros7, initial run1.7-1=6 steps \u2192 outputs7. But Example1 has4 outputs. So this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nHmm. This approach is inconsistent.\n\nAnother Idea: The number of outputs is equal to the number of trailing zeros divided by the initial run count, rounded down plus 1.\n\nExample0:4/2=2+1=3. Correct.\n\nExample1:7/1=7+1=8. But outputs4. Incorrect.\n\nExample2:7/3=2.333 \u21922+1=3. But outputs5. Incorrect.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAt this point, given that I'm stuck, I'll try to proceed with the test input. The test input is [1,1,1,0,...]. The initial run is3. Looking at Example2, which had initial run3 and outputs5 lines. The outputs added4 more 5s. So for the test input, perhaps the number of outputs is initial run3 plus2=5. Or similar.\n\nBut let's look at Example3: initial run4, outputs3. Which is4-1=3. So maybe it's the initial run minus1. But for Example0:3-1=2. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of outputs is the initial run. For Example0:2 \u21923 outputs. No.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. For the test input, which has an initial run of3 1s and trailing zeros9, the outputs would likely be the original array followed by adding one 1 each time until the run reaches6 or similar. Looking at Example2, which had initial run3 and outputs5 lines (3,4,5,6,7), the test input may follow a similar pattern. But since the array length is12, and the test input's trailing zeros are9, adding 9-3=6 steps would give a run of9. But that would require7 outputs (original plus6 steps). But according to Example2, initial run3 with trailing zeros7 gave5 outputs (3,4,5,6,7). So the number of outputs is5 for initial run3 and trailing zeros7 (7-3=4 steps).\n\nSo for the test input, trailing zeros9. 9-3=6 steps. So outputs would be initial run3 plus6 steps:3,4,5,6,7,8,9. That's7 outputs. But looking at the examples, this might not fit. For example, Example1: trailing zeros7, initial run1. 7-1=6 steps. But outputs are4. So maybe the number of steps is the initial run count. For example, in Example1, initial run1, steps3 (4 outputs). So steps= initial run+2.\n\nBut this is speculation. Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct answer for the test input is to generate outputs where the initial run of3 is increased by one each time for a total of5 outputs. For example:\n\n[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nBut how many lines? Looking at the examples, especially Example2, which had initial run3 and trailing zeros7, outputs5 lines. So for the test input, initial run3, trailing zeros9, perhaps outputs5 lines. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the number of outputs is the initial run count plus1. For example, initial run3 would have4 outputs. But Example2's initial run3 had5 outputs. Hmm.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the safest approach is to look at the examples and see that the number of output lines is equal to the initial run count plus 2. For Example0:2+1=3. Example2:3+2=5. Example1:1+3=4. Example3:4+ (-1)=3. This doesn't make sense.\n\nBut given the test input's initial run3, and looking at Example2 (initial3 \u2192 outputs5), perhaps the test input should have5 outputs. So the output would be:\n\n[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, Example2 had initial run3, outputs:\n\n[5,5,5,0...]\n\n[5,5,5,5,0...]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,0...]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,0...]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0...]\n\nSo five lines, each adding one 5 until there are7 5s. So initial3, added4 times. So total of5 outputs. So for test input, which has initial3, trailing9 zeros, perhaps the same pattern applies: add4 times. So outputs5 lines. The first line is the original, then four more lines adding one each. So the final line would have7 1s. But why7?\n\nExample2's trailing zeros7. initial3. So added4 times (3+4=7). So perhaps the number of outputs is initial count plus (number of trailing zeros - initial count) / 1? No. But in Example2, 7-3=4, so added4 times, leading to5 outputs.\n\nFor test input: trailing zeros9. 9-3=6. So added6 times. So outputs7 lines. But that would make the run3+6=9 1s. But the array length is12. So 9+3 zeros. So the output would be:\n\n[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,0,...]\n\n...\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0] (9 1s)\n\nBut according to Example2, this would be7 outputs. But the examples don't have such a case. So perhaps the number of outputs is the initial count plus the number of trailing zeros divided by the initial count. For example, in Example2,7/3=2.333, rounded down to2. So initial3 +2=5 outputs. For test input,9/3=3. So3+3=6 outputs. But that's just a guess.\n\nBut given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following approach based on Example2. For the test input with initial run3 and trailing zeros9, the number of outputs would be5. So:\n\nOriginal line.\n\nThen add one 1 each for four more lines, leading to:\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but that's7 1s. But why four additions?\n\nAlternatively, the number of outputs is the initial count plus 2. For initial3, 3+2=5 outputs. So five lines.\n\nYes, in Example2, initial3, outputs5. So test input would also have5 outputs.\n\nSo the test input's outputs would be:\n\n[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis matches the pattern of Example2, where initial run3 has5 outputs.",

The output starts with the same list, then adds a 1 in the next position, and another in the next. So the first list is original, then each next one adds a 1 until there's no more zeros maybe. Wait, the initial input has two 1s, then zeros. The outputs are three lists. The first is the original. The second adds a 1 in position 2 (third element), making three 1s. Then the third adds another 1 in position 3 (fourth element), making four 1s. Wait, but the original input has two 1s. So maybe the number of 1s increases by one each time until the count reaches the number of initial non-zero elements plus some number.\n\nWait, let's check another example. Example 1: Input [2,0,0,...]. The outputs start with the input, then add 2s. The first output is same as input (one 2), next has two 2s, then three, then four. So how many steps? The first example had input with two 1s, output lists with 2, then 3, then 4 ones. Wait, but the input starts with two 1s. Then each output adds one more 1 until the number of 1s is equal to the original count plus two? Wait, maybe not. Let me count.\n\nIn Example 0: input has two 1s. Outputs have 2, 3, 4 1s. Wait no. Wait the output lists are:\n\nOriginal: [1,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 two 1s.\n\nNext: [1,1,1,0,0,0] \u2192 three.\n\nThen next: four 1s. So from two to four, adding two steps. But why? The number of steps seems to be based on the initial count.\n\nWait, maybe the number of output lists is equal to the number of initial non-zero elements. Let's see.\n\nExample 0: initial non-zero elements are two (two 1s). The output has three lists. Hmm, no. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait Example 1: input [2,0,0,...]. The initial non-zero is one 2. Output has four lists. So one non-zero element gives four outputs? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of steps is determined by the number of zeros. Let's see. Example 0's input has four zeros. The outputs have three lists. Example 1's input has seven zeros. Output has four lists. Example 2's input starts with three 5s followed by seven zeros. Output has five lists. Example 3's input has four 8s and two zeros. Output has three lists. Example 4's input has one 7 and five zeros. Output has three lists.\n\nHmm. Let's see if the number of output lists is related to the number of initial non-zero elements. \n\nExample 0: 2 non-zero \u2192 3 outputs. Example 1: 1 \u21924 outputs. Example 2:3 \u21925 outputs. Example3:4\u21923 outputs. Example4:1\u21923. So that doesn't line up. Maybe another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs, each subsequent list increases the number of non-zero elements by one until the entire array is filled (or up to a certain point). Let's check:\n\nIn Example0, the original has two 1s, then each output adds one more. The original input has two 1s, next is three, then four. But the array length is six. So starting at two, then three, four. The outputs have three lists. The number of steps seems to be the initial count of non-zero elements. Wait, initial non-zero is two. Outputs have three lists. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that for each input, the output lists are generated by taking the initial non-zero elements, then adding one more of the same number (the first element?) each time until the number of non-zero elements is equal to the original count plus (original count -1). Wait, that might not fit. Let's see:\n\nExample0: original has two 1s. The outputs have 2,3,4. So adding two steps. The original count is 2, so steps would be 2. But the outputs have three lists. Hmm. Maybe the number of outputs is equal to the original count. Wait 2 \u21923 outputs. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of outputs is the original count of non-zero elements. For example, in Example0: two non-zero, three outputs. No. Example1: one non-zero, four outputs. So that doesn't fit.\n\nLooking at the outputs again, maybe each output adds a copy of the first element to the next position until the array is filled. For instance, in Example0, after the initial, they add 1s in the next positions. So the first output is the original. Then each next one appends a 1 (from the first element) to the next zero, replacing it. But the first element is 1, but in the input, the first two elements are 1. So maybe the pattern is to take the first block of identical numbers and expand them by one each step until the entire array is filled with that number?\n\nWait, let's check Example0:\n\nOriginal input: [1,1,0,0,0,0]. The outputs are:\n\n[1,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 original.\n\n[1,1,1,0,0,0] \u2192 added one 1 in third position.\n\n[1,1,1,1,0,0] \u2192 added another in fourth.\n\nSo each step adds a 1 to the next position. But how many steps? The outputs stop at three lists, but the array is length 6. So why three lists? Wait, the first output is the original. Then each subsequent list adds one more 1, so the number of steps is the number of positions after the initial block that can be filled. For example, in Example0, initial two 1s. Then the next positions are filled until the array is filled? No, because the outputs only go up to four 1s. Wait, the first example's outputs have three lists. The original is two 1s, then three, then four. So the number of steps is two, but three lists including the original.\n\nSo perhaps the number of output lists is equal to the count of the initial block. Example0: initial block of two 1s. Output lists: three. Hmm, two +1? Not sure.\n\nWait, Example1: input [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The initial block is one 2. The outputs have four lists: starting with one 2, then two, three, four. So four lists. So maybe the number of output lists is the initial block count plus two. 1 +3=4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of output lists is the number of elements in the initial non-zero block plus one. For example, in Example0, two 1s, outputs are three lists. So 2+1=3. Example1: initial block is one 2, outputs 4 lists. So 1+3=4. No, that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait looking at the output lists' lengths:\n\nFor each example, the number of output lists is equal to the number of non-zero elements in the input plus one. Wait:\n\nExample0: input has two 1s. Output has three lists. 2+1=3. That fits.\n\nExample1: input has one 2. Output has four lists. 1+3=4? No. Wait, maybe not. Or perhaps the number of lists is the original count plus the number of zeros divided by some factor. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the outputs represent the initial block growing by one element each time until the entire array is filled. But in Example0, the array is length 6. Original block is two. Then three, four, but why stop at four? Oh, because the outputs stop when the next addition would go beyond the array. Wait, no. Wait, the array is six elements. Let's see:\n\nOriginal: two 1s. Next is three, then four. Then next would be five, six. But in the outputs, they only show three steps. So why stop at four 1s?\n\nWait perhaps the number of steps is determined by the initial block's length. For example, if the initial block is N elements, then the output lists have N+1 elements. Wait, example0: N=2, outputs go up to 4 elements. That's N+2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of output lists is the initial count of non-zero elements. Example0 has two, but three outputs. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the outputs are generated by adding a copy of the first element to the next position until the number of non-zero elements is triple the original? Not matching examples.\n\nLooking at Example3:\n\nInput: [8,8,8,8,0,0]. Outputs have three lists. The original has four 8s. Outputs add one each time: 4,5,6. So three lists. So the number of lists is (6 -4) +1 =3. Which is the number of zeros plus one? The input has two zeros. So 2+1=3. Example3's zeros are 2, outputs have three lists. Example0's input has four zeros, outputs have three lists. Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, example0's input has four zeros. But the outputs have three lists. So 4 zeros would mean 4 steps? No.\n\nWait, let's see another approach. For each input, the outputs start with the original array, then each subsequent array adds the first element to the next position after the last non-zero element. The number of times this is done depends on the number of elements in the initial non-zero block.\n\nWait in Example0, initial non-zero block is two 1s. The outputs add a 1 in position 2 (third element), then position 3 (fourth element). So two steps. So the original array is included, so total three outputs. So the number of outputs is (number of initial non-zero elements) +1? Because 2 initial elements: three outputs. Example1: initial one element. Outputs four. So 1+3=4. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the outputs are generated by adding the first element to the next position until all the zeros are filled. For example, in Example0: four zeros. But the outputs only add two 1s. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe the number of outputs is the number of initial non-zero elements. Example0: two elements, three outputs. Not matching. Example1: one element, four outputs. No.\n\nAlternatively, the outputs are generated by taking the initial non-zero count, and adding one until the count is doubled. For example, in Example0: start with 2, then 3,4. So up to 4. Which is 2*2=4. So two steps. The outputs include the original, so three lists. So maybe the number of outputs is (initial count) +1. For example, 2+1=3. Example1: initial count 1, outputs 4. So 1+3=4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the outputs are generated by extending the initial block by one element each time until the entire array is filled. For example, in Example0, array length 6. Initial two 1s. Then three, four, five, six. But the outputs stop at four. So that's three steps. Not sure why.\n\nWait looking at Example3's input: [8,8,8,8,0,0]. Outputs are three lists. The original is four 8s. Then five, six. So three lists. The array length is six. So after four, adding two more gives six. So the number of steps is (array length - initial count). For Example3: 6-4=2 steps (plus original, total three outputs). In Example0: array length 6, initial count 2. 6-2=4. But outputs have three lists. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the steps are determined by the initial count. For example, the initial count N. Then, the number of outputs is N. For Example0: N=2, outputs 3. No. Example1: N=1, outputs 4. No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the outputs are generated by adding the first element to the next position until the number of elements added is equal to the initial count. For example, in Example0: initial two 1s. Add two more steps. So three outputs (original plus two). Example1: initial one 2, add three steps (four outputs). That would fit. So the number of outputs is initial count +1 (if original is step 0). Wait, for Example0: initial count is 2. So outputs are 2+1=3. Example1: 1+3=4. Hmm, maybe. Let's check:\n\nExample0: initial 2 \u2192 outputs 3. Correct.\n\nExample1: initial 1 \u2192 outputs 4. So 1 +3=4. Where does the 3 come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of outputs is the initial count plus the number of zeros. Wait Example0: initial count 2, zeros 4 \u2192 2+4=6. Outputs 3. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of outputs is the initial count plus the number of non-zero elements after the first block. But in the examples, all inputs start with a block of non-zero followed by zeros, so there are no non-zero after. So that's zero. So initial count +0 +1? For Example0: 2+0+1=3. That matches. Example1:1+0+1=2. But Example1's outputs have four lists. So no.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Let's look at the number of elements in each output list:\n\nIn Example0:\n\nOriginal has 2 non-zero.\n\nOutput1 has 3.\n\nOutput2 has4.\n\nSo each step adds one, starting from the original count.\n\nThe number of steps is (original count) steps. Because original count is 2, and steps are adding two more. But then outputs are original count + steps. But Example0 has 3 outputs (original plus two steps). So steps equal original count. So for original count N, the outputs are N+1 lists. For example:\n\nExample0: N=2 \u2192 3 outputs.\n\nExample1: N=1 \u2192 2 outputs. But in Example1, there are four outputs. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait in Example1's output, the initial count is 1. Then each step adds one until there are 4 2s. So four outputs. Original count 1, then 2,3,4. So three steps after original. So total outputs 4. So steps after original are 3. So 1+3=4. But why 3 steps?\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I need to look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs again, in each case, the outputs start with the input, then each subsequent line adds a copy of the first element to the next position until the number of elements added is equal to the original count. Wait, for example:\n\nExample0: original count 2. Then they add two more elements (third and fourth positions). So two steps, leading to three outputs. Example1: original count 1. Add three steps (each adding a 2), leading to four outputs. So steps after original is original count. But in Example0 steps after original are two (original count is 2). So that's 2 steps, leading to three outputs. Example1 steps after original are three (original count 1?), which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the steps are determined by the original count. For example, in Example0, original count is two. Then add two more elements. So outputs are original, then original+1, original+2. So three outputs. For Example1, original count is one. Add three elements (so three steps after original), leading to four outputs. So why three steps here?\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe another approach: look at the outputs and see how they are generated.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nInput: [1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutputs:\n\n[1,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 same as input.\n\nNext: [1,1,1,0,0,0] \u2192 add a 1 after the last 1.\n\nThen: [1,1,1,1,0,0] \u2192 add another 1 after the previous addition.\n\nSo each step adds a 1 to the next position. The number of steps seems to be the initial count of non-zero elements. Wait, initial count is two. So two steps after the original. So total three outputs. Yes. So for initial count N, outputs are N+1 steps. But in Example1:\n\nInput: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nInitial count is 1. So outputs should be 1+1=2? But there are four outputs. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, Example1's outputs have four lists. The original, then three more steps. But initial count is 1. So maybe N steps, where N is the initial count. For example, initial count 1, steps 3. So that's not consistent.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the number of outputs is equal to the number of non-zero elements in the input plus one. For Example0, two non-zero \u2192 three outputs. Example1, one \u2192 four outputs. Example2, three non-zero \u2192 five outputs. Example3, four \u2192 three outputs. Wait, no. Example3's input has four non-zero, but outputs are three. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of outputs is the length of the input minus the number of non-zero elements. For Example0, length 6 minus 2 non-zero is 4, but outputs are three. No.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe input has three 1s followed by nine zeros. The length is 12. According to the pattern observed, the outputs should start with the original list, then add a 1 in the next position each time. How many outputs? Let's see.\n\nIf we look at the examples, the number of outputs seems to correspond to the initial count of non-zero elements. For Example0: 2 non-zero \u2192 three outputs. Example1:1 \u2192 four. Example2:3 \u2192 five. Example3:4\u2192 three. Example4:1\u2192 three. Wait, no. That's inconsistent. So maybe the number of outputs is the initial count plus one. For example:\n\nExample0: 2 \u2192 3 (2+1).\n\nExample1:1 \u21924 (1+3). Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of outputs is the initial count plus two. Example0:2+1=3. Example1:1+3=4. Example2:3+2=5. Example3:4+(-1)=3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the difference between the initial count and the maximum count in the outputs:\n\nExample0: starts at 2, ends at 4. Difference 2. Number of outputs:3. So steps are 2. So steps equal to initial count.\n\nExample1: starts at1, ends at4. Difference3. Steps:3. So steps equal to initial count \u00d73? No.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum count in the outputs is the initial count multiplied by two. Example0: 2\u00d72=4. Correct. Example1:1\u00d74=4. Yes. Example2:3\u00d72=6. Wait in Example2, the input is three 5s. Outputs go up to 7 5s. Wait example2's input is [5,5,5,0,...], outputs have 3,4,5,6,7 5s. Original count is3. Max count is7. Which is 3+4=7. Not sure.\n\nWait in Example2, the outputs are:\n\nOriginal:3 5s.\n\nThen4,5,6,7.\n\nSo four steps after original. So total five outputs. Which is original count (3) +2 steps. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of outputs is the initial count of non-zero elements. For example, in Example0, 2 \u21923 outputs. No. Example2,3\u21925. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let me try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at all examples:\n\n- The output lists start with the original input.\n\n- Each subsequent list adds a copy of the first element (the first non-zero number) to the next position (after the existing non-zeros).\n\n- The number of output lists is equal to the number of non-zero elements in the input plus the number of zeros divided by the initial non-zero count. No, that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the number of output lists is determined by the number of non-zero elements in the input plus one. For example:\n\nExample0: 2 \u21923 (2+1).\n\nExample1:1 \u21922. But outputs are4. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of outputs is the number of non-zero elements in the input multiplied by something. For Example0:2 \u21923 (2\u00d71.5). Not helpful.\n\nAlternative approach: looking for the number of times you can add the element to the next position. For example, in Example0: original has two 1s. Then you can add a 1 to position2 (third element), then position3, etc. How many times? Until you reach the end of the array. Wait in Example0, the array is length6. Original has two 1s. Then adding one each time until the array is filled. That would take adding four 1s. But the output only adds two.\n\nWait, no. Example0's outputs are:\n\nOriginal: [1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nNext: [1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nThen: [1,1,1,1,0,0]\n\nSo the next step would be adding a 1 to position4 (fifth element), but that's not present. So they stopped after adding two. So why?\n\nMaybe the number of steps is determined by the initial count of non-zero elements. So initial count is N, steps are N. So in Example0: two steps, three outputs (original plus two steps). Example1: one step, but in Example1 the outputs are four lists. So original plus three steps. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the steps are determined by the number of zeros in the input divided by the initial non-zero count. For Example0: four zeros divided by two \u2192 two steps. Which fits. Example1: seven zeros divided by one \u2192 seven steps, but the outputs are four lists. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the steps are the initial non-zero count. Example0: two steps (two adds), leading to three outputs. Example1: one step. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's think about the number of elements added in each example:\n\nExample0 adds two 1s (from two to four).\n\nExample1 adds three 2s (from one to four).\n\nExample2 adds four 5s (from three to seven).\n\nExample3 adds two 8s (from four to six).\n\nExample4 adds two 7s (from one to three).\n\nWait, the number of added elements seems to be (initial count) +1. For example, Example1 added three (1+3=4). Example0: added two (2+2=4). Not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, the number of added elements is the initial count. Example0: 2 added. Example1:3 added. So initial count 1, added 3. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's look at the examples:\n\nExample0: input has two 1s. Outputs add two more 1s (third and fourth positions). So total four 1s.\n\nExample1: input has one 2. Outputs add three 2s (positions 2-4). Total four 2s.\n\nExample2: input has three 5s. Outputs add four more, totaling seven.\n\nExample3: input has four 8s. Outputs add two more, totaling six.\n\nExample4: input has one 7. Outputs add two 7s, totaling three.\n\nSo the total number of elements added is (initial count) multiplied by something. Let's see:\n\nExample0: initial 2 \u2192 added 2. 2\u00d71=2.\n\nExample1: initial1 \u2192 added3. 1\u00d73=3.\n\nExample2: initial3 \u2192 added4. 3\u00d71.33=4.\n\nExample3: initial4 \u2192 added2. 4\u00d70.5=2.\n\nExample4: initial1 \u2192 added2. 1\u00d72=2.\n\nNo clear pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, the number of added elements is equal to the number of zeros in the input divided by something. For example:\n\nExample0: 4 zeros. Added 2. 4/2=2.\n\nExample1:7 zeros. Added3. 7/2.333=3.\n\nExample2:7 zeros. Added4. 7/1.75=4.\n\nExample3:2 zeros. Added2. 2/1=2.\n\nExample4:5 zeros. Added2. 5/2.5=2.\n\nSo number of added elements is zeros divided by (something). It seems that in each case, the number of added elements is the number of zeros divided by the initial count. For example:\n\nExample0:4 zeros, initial count2 \u2192 4/2=2 added.\n\nExample1:7 zeros, initial count1 \u21927/1=7. But added3. No.\n\nSo that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of added elements is the initial count. But Example0's added 2, initial count 2. Example1 added3, initial count1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the key is that each output list extends the previous by adding one instance of the first element to the next available zero spot. The number of outputs is the number of such possible additions until you reach a certain point. Like, the number of additions is equal to the initial count of non-zero elements.\n\nWait in Example0, two non-zero elements. So you add two times, leading to three outputs (original plus two). In Example1, one non-zero element. Add three times, leading to four outputs. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of outputs is determined by the initial non-zero count plus the number of times you can add before the entire array is filled. For example:\n\nExample0's array has six elements. Initial two 1s. You can add four more to fill the array. But the outputs only add two. So why?\n\nMaybe the pattern is to add as many elements as the initial non-zero count. For example:\n\nExample0: initial two \u2192 add two, leading to three outputs. Example1: initial one \u2192 add three, leading to four. Example2: initial three \u2192 add four, leading to five. Example3: initial four \u2192 add two, leading to three. Example4: initial one \u2192 add two, leading to three.\n\nBut where does the number of additions come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of additions (steps) is the initial non-zero count. For Example0, initial two \u2192 two additions (three outputs). Example1, initial one \u2192 one addition (two outputs). But Example1's outputs have four lists. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the pattern is that each output list adds a copy of the first element to the next position, and the number of outputs is such that the final output list has the initial non-zero elements plus the same number again. For example:\n\nExample0: initial two 1s. Final output has four 1s (2\u00d72). So two additions. Three outputs.\n\nExample1: initial one 2. Final output has four 2s (1\u00d74). So three additions. Four outputs.\n\nExample2: initial three 5s. Final output has seven 5s (3 +4). So four additions. Five outputs.\n\nExample3: initial four 8s. Final output has six 8s (4 +2). So two additions. Three outputs.\n\nExample4: initial one 7. Final output has three 7s (1+2). So two additions. Three outputs.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the number of additions (steps) is the initial non-zero count. For example:\n\nExample0: initial count2 \u2192 two steps. Original plus two steps. Three outputs.\n\nExample1: initial count1 \u2192 three steps. Original plus three steps. Four outputs.\n\nWait, but how does initial count relate to the steps? In Example1, initial count is 1, steps are3. So 1 \u00d73=3 steps. Example0:2 \u21922 steps. 2 \u00d71=2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of steps is the initial non-zero count multiplied by something. For example, in Example0:2 steps, initial count2. 2\u00d71=2. Example1:3 steps, initial count1 \u00d73=3. Example2:4 steps, initial3 \u00d71.333=4. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the steps are determined by the number of zeros divided by the initial count. For example:\n\nExample0:4 zeros/2=2 steps.\n\nExample1:7 zeros/1=7 steps. But outputs have three steps. No.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's look at the outputs again:\n\nThe outputs start with the original. Then each next output adds one more of the first element to the next zero position. The number of outputs seems to be the initial count plus one. Wait:\n\nExample0: initial count2. Outputs three. 2+1=3. Correct.\n\nExample1: initial count1. Outputs four. 1+3=4. Not sure.\n\nExample2: initial count3. Outputs five.3+2=5.\n\nExample3: initial count4. Outputs three.4-1=3. Not sure.\n\nHmm. Another angle: the outputs create a sequence where the number of non-zero elements increases by one each step until the number of non-zero elements is double the initial count. For example:\n\nExample0: initial 2 \u21924. So two steps. Three outputs. Correct.\n\nExample1: initial1 \u21924. Three steps. Four outputs. Correct.\n\nExample2: initial3 \u21927. No, 3\u00d72=6, but the output goes to7. So not.\n\nExample3: initial4 \u21926. Not double. \n\nExample4: initial1 \u21923. Which is triple. Hmm.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAnother possibility: the number of outputs is the number of non-zero elements in the input plus the number of zeros divided by the number of non-zero elements. But this seems too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the number of outputs is the initial non-zero count plus the number of zeros divided by the initial non-zero count. For example:\n\nExample0: 2 + (4/2) =2+2=4. No.\n\nExample1:1 +7/1=8. No.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking at all examples, the outputs generate a series where each subsequent list increases the number of the first element by one until it reaches the length of the initial block plus the number of zeros. But that doesn't fit. For example, Example0: initial two 1s plus four zeros. So total six elements. The outputs go up to four 1s. Which is two more than the initial. So not sure.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the pattern is simply that each output adds one more instance of the first element to the next zero position, and the number of outputs is determined by the initial non-zero count plus the number of steps possible until the zeros are filled. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of outputs is always three, but the examples show otherwise. For example, Example0 has three outputs, Example1 four, Example2 five, Example3 three, Example4 three. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the number of outputs is the initial non-zero count plus one. For example:\n\nExample0:2+1=3. Correct.\n\nExample1:1+3=4. No.\n\nExample2:3+2=5. No.\n\nExample3:4-1=3. No.\n\nBut there's no clear pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of outputs is determined by the position where the initial non-zero elements end. For example, in Example0, the initial non-zero elements end at index 1 (since it's 0-based). The array length is6. So the number of possible additions is the array length minus the initial end index minus 1. For Example0:6-1-1=4. But outputs have three lists. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of outputs is the number of zeros divided by the initial non-zero count, rounded up. Example0:4/2=2 \u21922+1=3. Correct. Example1:7/1=7 \u21927+1=8. No.\n\nThis is really challenging. Perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let's try to see the pattern in the test input.\n\nTest input: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis has three 1s followed by nine zeros. So the initial count is three. Following the examples, the outputs should start with the original, then add a 1 each time. How many outputs?\n\nLooking at Example2, which had three 5s, the outputs were five lists. So original plus four steps. Let's see:\n\nExample2 input has three 5s. Outputs:\n\n[5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[5,5,5,5,0,...]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,0,...]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,0...]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0...]\n\nSo five outputs. Original plus four steps. So for initial count three, five outputs. So steps are four. So perhaps the number of outputs is initial count plus two. 3+2=5. For the test input, initial count three, so 3+2=5 outputs.\n\nSo the test input would have the original list, then add a 1 in the next position each time for four steps. So the outputs would be:\n\nOriginal: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nStep1: [1,1,1,1,0,...]\n\nStep2: [1,1,1,1,1,0,...]\n\nStep3: [1,1,1,1,1,1,0...]\n\nStep4: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0...]\n\nSo five outputs. But wait, the array length is twelve. After three 1s, adding four more would make seven 1s. The array has twelve positions. So adding four steps would result in seven 1s. But why stop at seven?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of outputs is initial count plus two. For test input, three plus two equals five outputs. So the outputs would be:\n\n[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,0,...]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,0...]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,0...]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0...]\n\nWhich is five outputs, each adding one 1. So the test input's output would have five lists. Let's check if that fits with the examples.\n\nExample2 had three initial 5s, which resulted in five outputs. So yes, initial count three \u21925 outputs.\n\nExample0: initial count two \u21923 outputs (2+1). Hmm, but earlier thought that it's initial count plus two, but that doesn't fit. Wait, no, example2 is initial count three, outputs five \u21923+2=5.\n\nExample1: initial count one \u2192 four outputs. So 1+3=4. No, but in this case, the pattern isn't consistent. So maybe there's another factor.\n\nAlternatively, for the test input, the number of outputs is initial count plus two. So 3+2=5.\n\nThus, the test input's output would have five lists, each adding a 1 until there are seven 1s.\n\nSo the outputs would be:\n\n[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis matches the pattern observed in the examples. For example, in Example2 with three initial 5s, there are five outputs. So applying this to the test input with three initial 1s, we would expect five output lists.",
