        "cot_1": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples. Let's start by looking at Example 0. \n\nThe input is a 16-element list, and the output is a 5-element list. Hmm, so maybe the output is derived by taking specific elements from the input. Let's check the positions. Let's look at the first input list in Example 0:\n\nInput: [2, 1, 2, 2, 6, 5, 5, 6, 6, 5, 5, 6, 2, 2, 1, 2]\nOutput: [5, 8, 8, 2, 5]\n\nWait, but the output for Example 0's first output is [5,8,8,2,5]. Let's check which input list in the example corresponds to this output. Wait, actually, the input in Example 0 is a 16x16 grid? Wait, looking again: the INPUT for Example 0 is multiple lists. Let me recheck. Oh right, the input is 16 lists, each of 16 elements. And the output is 5 lists each of 5 elements. So each output list is perhaps derived from the corresponding input grid.\n\nWait, the example 0 input is a list of 16 lists (each length 16), and the output is 5 lists (each length 5). So maybe the output is a central portion or some kind of extraction from the input grid.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. The first input list is [2,1,2,2,6,5,5,6,6,5,5,6,2,2,1,2]. The first output list is [5,8,8,2,5]. Wait, perhaps the output rows are taken from the middle of the input grid. Let's see: the input has 16 rows. The output has 5 rows, so maybe rows 6 to 10 or something like that. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the output is 5 lists. Let me look at the input lists. The input lists start from index 0 to 15. The output for Example 0 is 5 lists. Let's see which input rows they correspond to. Let's take the first output list [5,8,8,2,5]. Looking at the input lists, perhaps row 4 (index 4) of the input is [6,5,5,6,5,8,5,7,7,5,8,5,6,5,5,6]. The middle elements here are 8,5,7,7,5. Hmm, not matching. Wait the output's first element is 5. Maybe it's taking the center part of each row. For example, each input row is 16 elements. The output rows are 5 elements. So maybe taking elements 5 to 9 (inclusive) of each row. Let's check. For row 4 in Example 0's input, elements 5 to 9 are 8,5,7,7,5. But the first output list is [5,8,8,2,5]. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 5x5 grid taken from the center of the 16x16 input grid. Since 16 is even, perhaps the center is around rows 7-11 and columns 7-11. Let's check. For Example 0, the output has 5 rows. Let's see the input rows 6-10 (indices 5 to 9). Let's take row 5: [5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,5]. The middle elements of this row might be positions 6-10: 5,8,8,3,3. But the first output list in Example 0 is [5,8,8,2,5]. Hmm, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe looking at columns. Let's see the output of Example 0's first output row is [5,8,8,2,5]. Let's see if there's a column in the input that matches. For instance, in row 5, element 6 is 5, element 7 is 8, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the central 5x5 grid of the input. The 16x16 grid's center would be around the 8th row and 8th column (since 16/2=8). So rows 6-10 (indices 5-9) and columns 6-10 (indices 5-9). Let's check. For Example 0's first output row, which is [5,8,8,2,5]. Let's look at row 5 (index 5) of the input: [5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,5]. The elements from indices 5-9 are 8,5,8,8,3. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe the output is a 5x5 grid starting from row 5 to row 9 and column 5 to column 9. Let's check Example 0's output. The first output list is [5,8,8,2,5]. Let's take row 5 of the input (index 5) and columns 5-9. The elements are 8,5,8,8,3. The output's first list is [5,8,8,2,5]. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the fifth row (index 4) of the input? Let's check. The first output in Example 0 is [5,8,8,2,5]. Input row 4 is [6,5,5,6,5,8,5,7,7,5,8,5,6,5,5,6]. The middle elements here would be 5,7,7,5,8. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th rows of the input, and then take the 5th to 9th elements of each. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the output has 5 rows. Let's take the input rows 5 to 9 (indices 5-9). For each row, take elements 5-9 (indices 5-9). Let's see:\n\nRow 5 (index 5): [5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,5] \u2192 elements 5-9 are 8,5,8,8,3 \u2192 [8,5,8,8,3]\n\nBut the first output row is [5,8,8,2,5]. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe taking the 6th element of each row. Wait, maybe the output is a cross-section, like the middle row and middle column. For a 16x16 grid, the center would be around rows 7-8 and columns 7-8. But how to get a 5x5 output from that? Maybe it's a diamond shape or something else.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe output lists are:\n\n[5,8,8,2,5]\n\n[5,5,5,2,5]\n\n[8,8,7,2,2]\n\n[8,8,7,2,2]\n\n[5,5,5,2,5]\n\nLooking at the input for Example 0, maybe the output is the central 5 rows and 5 columns. Let's check. For example, the middle rows are 7,8,9,10,11 (assuming 0-based index). Let's take rows 6 to 10 (indices 5-9), but that's 5 rows. Then for each of those rows, take columns 6-10 (indices 5-9). Let's see:\n\nRow 5 (index 5): elements 5-9 are 8,5,8,8,3 \u2192 [8,5,8,8,3]\n\nRow 6: elements 5-9 of row 6 are 5,5,5,8,3 \u2192 [5,5,5,8,3]\n\nRow7: elements5-9 are 5,7,8,8,8 \u2192 [7,8,8,8,8]\n\nWait, but the output rows in Example0's first output are [5,8,8,2,5], which doesn't align with that. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternative approach: Look at the output for each example and see if there's a pattern in the numbers. For Example 0's output:\n\nThe first output list is [5,8,8,2,5]. Let's see where 5,8,8,2,5 might come from in the input. Looking at input row 5 (index5) in Example0: [5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,5]. The elements in positions 6-10: 5,8,8,3,3. No match. Wait, but maybe it's a diagonal. For instance, maybe the output is the central 5x5 matrix where each row is from a different part. Let's see. The middle of 16x16 is around (8,8). So maybe the output is a 5x5 grid centered at (8,8). So rows 6-10 and columns 6-10? Let's check:\n\nRow 6 (index6) of input is [5,5,5,2,5,5,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,5,5]. Columns 6-10 would be elements 5,5,8,8,3. So [5,5,8,8,3]. But the second output row in Example0 is [5,5,5,2,5], which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe the output is taking certain elements from each row, like the 5th element of each row. But the first output in Example0 is [5,8,8,2,5]. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the input lists for Example0's output, which are 5 rows. Let's check the input rows that are part of the output. For example, the first output row is [5,8,8,2,5]. Let's look at input rows 5-9 (assuming output is 5 rows). For example, input row5: [5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,5]. The elements at positions 4,5,6,7,8 are 8,8,5,8,8. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the central 5 elements of the central 5 rows. For example, in a 16x16 grid, the central rows are 7,8,9 (but 5 rows would be 6-10). Then, for each of those rows, take the central 5 elements (columns 6-10). Let's check:\n\nExample0's input row6 (index6): [5,5,5,2,5,5,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,5,5]. The central 5 elements would be positions 6-10: 5,8,8,3,3. The output's second row is [5,5,5,2,5], which doesn't match. \n\nWait this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's input and output, perhaps the output is a mirror or a reflection. For instance, the input is a symmetrical pattern, and the output is a section of it. Or perhaps the output is created by taking the difference between adjacent elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the output are the counts of certain digits in the input rows. But looking at Example0's first output row [5,8,8,2,5], it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformed version of a central part of the input. For example, each element in the output is the sum or product of certain elements in the input.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input and the training examples, perhaps the output is the middle 5 elements of the middle 5 rows. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's input, the output is 5 rows. Let's assume the middle rows are 6-10 (indices 5-9). Then for each of those rows, take the middle 5 elements. For a 16-element row, the middle 5 would be elements 6-10 (indices 5-9). Let's check:\n\nRow5: indices5-9: 8,5,8,8,3 \u2192 [8,5,8,8,3]\n\nRow6: indices5-9:5,5,5,8,3 \u2192 [5,5,5,8,3]\n\nRow7: indices5-9:7,8,8,8,8 \u2192 [7,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow8: same as row7.\n\nRow9: same as row6.\n\nBut Example0's output is:\n\n[5,8,8,2,5]\n\n[5,5,5,2,5]\n\n[8,8,7,2,2]\n\n[8,8,7,2,2]\n\n[5,5,5,2,5]\n\nThese don't match. So perhaps that's not the pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th elements from the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th rows. For Example0's output:\n\nTake rows 5-9 and columns 5-9. Let's check:\n\nRow5: elements5-9:8,5,8,8,3 \u2192 Output row0:5,8,8,2,5. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of certain positions. For example, the first element of each output row is the 5th element of the input row, the second is the 6th, etc. But in Example0's first output row, [5,8,8,2,5], let's see:\n\nLooking at row5 of input: [5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,5]. The 5th element (index4) is 8. But output starts with 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking elements from specific positions that form a cross. For example, the middle element and the ones around it in a cross shape. But a 5x5 output would require a larger cross.\n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output for each example. Let's take Example0's input and output:\n\nLooking at the first output list [5,8,8,2,5]. Let's search where these numbers appear in the input. For instance, the number 5 appears in many places. The number 8 is in the input rows 4,5,6, etc. For example, input row4: elements 5 is 8, row5 has 8 in position5 and 8 in position7. Hmm. But how does that form the output?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the fifth row of the input, reversed. Let's check:\n\nInput row4 (index4) is [6,5,5,6,5,8,5,7,7,5,8,5,6,5,5,6]. Reversed would be [6,5,5,6,5,8,5,7,7,5,8,5,6,5,5,6] reversed is [6,5,5,6,5,8,7,7,5,8,5,6,5,5,6,6]. Not matching the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the middle elements of each quadrant. But with 16x16, it's divided into four 8x8 quadrants, but how that would form a 5x5 output is unclear.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a 5x5 grid taken from the center of the input grid. For a 16x16 grid, the center would be from rows 6-10 and columns 6-10. Let's check for Example0:\n\nRow5 (index5) columns6-10 (indices5-9): 8,5,8,8,3 \u2192 [8,5,8,8,3]\n\nRow6: elements5-9:5,5,5,8,3 \u2192 [5,5,5,8,3]\n\nRow7: elements5-9:7,8,8,8,8 \u2192 [7,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow8: same as row7.\n\nRow9: same as row6.\n\nSo the 5x5 grid would be:\n\n[8,5,8,8,3]\n\n[5,5,5,8,3]\n\n[7,8,8,8,8]\n\n[7,8,8,8,8]\n\n[5,5,5,8,3]\n\nBut the output for Example0 is:\n\n[5,8,8,2,5]\n\n[5,5,5,2,5]\n\n[8,8,7,2,2]\n\n[8,8,7,2,2]\n\n[5,5,5,2,5]\n\nSo this doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is derived from certain columns in the input. For example, looking at the first output row of Example0: [5,8,8,2,5]. Let's check column5 in the input. Column indices are 0-15. For row5, column5 would be 8 (input row5: elements5 is 8). But the output's first element is 5, which may not be from column5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the diagonal elements of the central 5x5 grid. For example, take rows 5-9 and columns 5-9, then take the diagonal. But the output has 5 rows, each with 5 elements, which wouldn't fit a diagonal.\n\nWait, looking at the test input:\n\nTest input has 16 lists, each of 16 elements. The output should be 5 lists of 5 elements each, following the pattern from the training examples.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output for each training example and see if there's a common pattern.\n\nExample0's output has 5 lists. The first and fifth are [5,8,8,2,5] and [5,5,5,2,5]. The middle three rows are [8,8,7,2,2] and two of them.\n\nLooking at the input lists in Example0:\n\nRows 5-9 are:\n\n[5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,5] (row5)\n\n[5,5,5,2,5,5,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,5,5] (row6)\n\n[6,2,2,2,7,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,2,6] (row7)\n\n[6,2,2,2,7,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,2,6] (row8)\n\n[5,5,5,2,5,5,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,5,5] (row9)\n\nSo for row5, maybe the output is taking elements 4,5,6,7,8: 8,5,8,8,3 \u2192 but Example0's first output row is [5,8,8,2,5]. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a rotated or flipped version of the central part. For example, taking a 5x5 section and rotating it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the fifth element of each of the fifth to ninth rows. But for Example0's first output row, the fifth element of row5 is 8. The output's first element is 5. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived from the numbers that appear in the middle of the input. For instance, the input has a lot of 3s and 8s in certain rows. Looking at Example0's input rows 5-9, the 3s appear towards the end of each row. The output rows have 5,8,2, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the elements from the input where the row and column indices sum to a certain value. For example, in a 16x16 grid, the diagonal or anti-diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be formed by taking the fifth row (index4) and the elements from index5 to 9, then the sixth row, elements5-9, etc. But this doesn't align with the output.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as a 16x16 grid where each row is a ring around a center. Maybe the output is the central 5x5 grid. But in a 16x16 grid, the exact center is not clear. It would require even numbers, so maybe the central area is from row 6 to row 10 and column 6 to 10. Let's check for Example0:\n\nRow6 (index6) of input: [5,5,5,2,5,5,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,5,5]\n\nElements6-10: 5,8,8,3,3. But the output's second row is [5,5,5,2,5], which doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's output, the first and last rows are [5,8,8,2,5] and [5,5,5,2,5]. The middle rows are [8,8,7,2,2] repeated twice. Maybe these correspond to certain features in the input.\n\nLooking at row7 and row8 in the input for Example0: they are the same. Their elements are [6,2,2,2,7,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,2,6]. The middle elements here are 8,8,8,8,3 (indices5-9). But the output's third row is [8,8,7,2,2]. Hmm. Maybe taking elements 4-8:7,8,8,8,8. Which would be [7,8,8,8,8], but the output is [8,8,7,2,2]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the input grid in a specific pattern. For example, taking every third element from a certain row. But not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output rows are formed by taking the 5th element from the corresponding row, then the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th. Let's check Example0's first output row: [5,8,8,2,5]. If this corresponds to row5 of the input, then elements 4,5,6,7,8 are 8,5,8,8,3. Not matching. But the output starts with 5. Where is 5 in row5? The first element of row5 is 5, then 6,5,2,8, etc. So maybe it's elements 0,5,6,7,8? 5,5,8,8,3. Which would be [5,5,8,8,3]. Not matching the output [5,8,8,2,5].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are formed by taking elements from the input in a spiral or some other pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the test input provided. The test input has 16 lists. Let's look at the structure. For example, the first test input list is [5,5,2,5,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,5,2,5,5]. The middle elements might be important. Let's compare with the training examples.\n\nIn the training examples, the outputs seem to have numbers that appear in the input but in a condensed form. For example, in Example0's output, there are 5s, 8s, 2s. Looking at the input rows 5-9, these numbers are present in certain positions.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the central 5 elements of each of the central 5 rows. For example, for each row in the middle 5 rows, take the central 5 elements. For a 16-element row, the central 5 would be elements 6-10 (indices 5-9). Let's check Example0's row5: elements5-9 are 8,5,8,8,3. Output row0 is [5,8,8,2,5]. Doesn't match. So perhaps not.\n\nAnother approach: The output is a transformed version of the input, perhaps by some mathematical operation. For example, each element in the output is the sum of adjacent elements in the input. But this would require more calculation and may not fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first five elements of the middle five rows. But in Example0, row5's first five elements are [5,6,5,2,8], which doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the last five elements of the middle five rows. For Example0's row5, the last five elements are [3,3,3,3,6,5], but taking the last five would be [3,3,6,5], which isn't enough. Wait, no. Each row has 16 elements. Last five would be elements 11-15: for row5, elements11-15 are [3,3,3,3,6,5], wait no. Wait indices 11 to 15 are positions 11,12,13,14,15. For row5: [5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,5]. So elements11-15: 3,3,3,6,5. Which would be [3,3,3,6,5]. Not matching output.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the fifth element from each row in the middle five rows. For Example0's rows5-9, the fifth elements are:\n\nRow5: 8 (element4)\n\nRow6:5 (element4)\n\nRow7:7 (element4)\n\nRow8:7 (element4)\n\nRow9:5 (element4)\n\nBut the output's first element is 5, which doesn't fit. So this approach isn't working.\n\nLet me think differently. The output in Example0 has 5 lists, which might correspond to the middle 5 rows of the input. Looking at the input's rows5-9, the output might be a transformation where certain digits are extracted based on their frequency or position. For example, in row5, the numbers 5 and 8 are prominent. The output's first row starts with 5, which is the first element of row5.\n\nWait, row5 starts with 5. The output's first element is 5. The second element of the output's first row is 8, which is element5 of row5. Hmm, maybe it's taking elements 0,5,6,7,8 from row5. Let's see: elements0 is5,5 is8,6 is5,7 is8,8 is8. That would give [5,8,5,8,8], but the output is [5,8,8,2,5]. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the diagonal of the central 5x5 grid. For example, in rows5-9 and columns5-9, the diagonal elements. For row5, column5:8; row6, column6:5; row7, column7:8; row8, column8:8; row9, column9:3. That would give [8,5,8,8,3], which doesn't match the first output row [5,8,8,2,5]. So no.\n\nAnother idea: The output is the middle 5 elements of the middle 5 rows. For each row, take elements6-10 (indices5-9). Then, within those, take the middle 5 elements. But that's the same as taking elements5-9. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of specific columns from specific rows. For example, the first output row might be column5 from rows5-9. But that would give a vertical column. But the output is a list of 5 elements in a row. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the central 5 elements of each row in the middle 5 rows. For a row of 16 elements, the central 5 are elements6-10 (indices5-9). Let's check for Example0's row5: elements5-9 are 8,5,8,8,3. The output's first row is [5,8,8,2,5]. Not matching. But maybe there's a transformation applied, like reversing the order. Reversed, it would be [3,8,8,5,8], which still doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the elements from the input grid where the row and column indices are even or odd. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, look for the presence of the number 3 in the input. In Example0's input, rows5-9 have a lot of 3s towards the end. But the output doesn't have any 3s. So maybe the output is formed by taking elements before the 3s. For example, in row5 of Example0, elements5-9 are 8,5,8,8,3. So before the 3s, the elements are 8,5,8,8. But the output is [5,8,8,2,5]. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the output is the transpose of a certain section of the input. For example, taking columns 5-9 of rows5-9 and then transposing them. Let's see:\n\nFor Example0, columns5-9 of rows5-9:\n\nRow5:8,5,8,8,3\n\nRow6:5,5,5,8,3\n\nRow7:7,8,8,8,8\n\nRow8:7,8,8,8,8\n\nRow9:5,5,5,8,3\n\nTransposing this would make columns into rows:\n\nFirst transposed row:8,5,7,7,5 \u2192 which would be [8,5,7,7,5]\n\nSecond transposed row:5,5,8,8,5 \u2192 [5,5,8,8,5]\n\nThird:8,5,8,8,5 \u2192 [8,5,8,8,5]\n\nFourth:8,8,8,8,8 \u2192 [8,8,8,8,8]\n\nFifth:3,3,8,8,3 \u2192 [3,3,8,8,3]\n\nBut Example0's output is:\n\n[5,8,8,2,5]\n\n[5,5,5,2,5]\n\n[8,8,7,2,2]\n\n[8,8,7,2,2]\n\n[5,5,5,2,5]\n\nThis doesn't match the transposed section. So this isn't the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the middle 5 elements of each of the middle 5 rows, but with some transformation. For example, taking the maximum value in each row's middle section. But Example0's first output row is [5,8,8,2,5], which doesn't match the maximum of 8 in the first middle section.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Let me try to look for another angle.\n\nLooking at the test input, let's see if I can spot any patterns. The test input has 16 lists. Let's look at the middle rows, say rows 4 to 8 (indices 4-8). For example:\n\nRow4: [2,5,5,5,4,6,6,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,2]\n\nRow5: [5,5,2,2,6,6,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,5,5]\n\nRow6: [5,2,2,5,6,9,6,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,5]\n\nRow7: [5,2,5,5,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,2,5]\n\nRow8: Same as row7.\n\nLooking at these, the elements towards the end (indices 9-13) are 3,3,3,3,3 in many rows. The output might exclude these 3s. The output for the test input needs to be 5 lists of 5 elements each. Looking at the training examples, the outputs don't have 3s, even though the inputs have many 3s. So maybe the 3s are excluded, and the output is taken from the parts before the 3s.\n\nFor example, in Example0's row5: [5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,5]. The 3s start at element9. So the elements before that are 5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8. Taking the last five elements before the 3s:8,5,8,8. But that's only four elements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the five elements before the run of 3s. For example, in row5 of Example0's input, the 3s start at element9. So elements4-8:8,5,8,8,3. Wait, element8 is 3. So perhaps elements4-8 (inclusive) are 8,5,8,8,3. The output's first row is [5,8,8,2,5]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the elements before the 3s. In row5 of Example0, before the 3s (element9), elements0-8 are [5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8]. The last five elements here are8,5,8,8. Not enough.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's try to think differently.\n\nIn the training examples, the outputs are 5x5 grids. The test input's output should also be a 5x5 grid. Maybe the pattern is that the output is the central 5x5 grid of the input, but with some transformation applied, such as rotation or flipping.\n\nLooking at Example0's input, the central 5x5 would be rows6-10 and columns6-10. Let's check:\n\nRow6: elements6-10 (indices5-9):5,5,5,8,3 \u2192 [5,5,5,8,3]\n\nRow7: elements5-9:7,8,8,8,8 \u2192 [7,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow8: same as row7.\n\nRow9: same as row6.\n\nRow10: [5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8,5,8,8,2,5,6,5]. Elements5-9:8,5,8,8,5 \u2192 [8,5,8,8,5]\n\nSo the central 5x5 would be:\n\nRow6: [5,5,5,8,3]\n\nRow7: [7,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow8: [7,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow9: [5,5,5,8,3]\n\nRow10: [8,5,8,8,5]\n\nBut Example0's output is:\n\n[5,8,8,2,5]\n\n[5,5,5,2,5]\n\n[8,8,7,2,2]\n\n[8,8,7,2,2]\n\n[5,5,5,2,5]\n\nThis doesn't match. However, maybe the central 5x5 is rotated or flipped. For example, rotated 180 degrees. The original central part would look like:\n\n5 5 5 8 3\n\n7 8 8 8 8\n\n7 8 8 8 8\n\n5 5 5 8 3\n\n8 5 8 8 5\n\nRotated 180 degrees, it would be:\n\n5 8 8 5 8\n\n3 8 5 5 5 \n\n8 8 8 8 7 \n\n8 8 8 8 7 \n\n3 8 5 5 5 \n\nWhich still doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the central 5x5 grid but with each row reversed. For example, row6 reversed:3,8,5,5,5. This would be the first output row of Example0: [5,8,8,2,5] doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: The output is created by taking the fifth through ninth elements of the fifth through ninth rows and then flipping them vertically and horizontally. For example, transposing and then reversing. Let's see:\n\nOriginal central 5x5:\n\n5 5 5 8 3\n\n7 8 8 8 8 \n\n7 8 8 8 8 \n\n5 5 5 8 3 \n\n8 5 8 8 5 \n\nTransposing gives:\n\n5 7 7 5 8 \n\n5 8 8 5 5 \n\n5 8 8 5 8 \n\n8 8 8 8 8 \n\n3 8 8 3 5 \n\nThen flipping vertically:\n\n3 8 8 3 5 \n\n8 8 8 8 8 \n\n5 8 8 5 8 \n\n5 8 8 5 5 \n\n5 7 7 5 8 \n\nThis doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the central 5x5 grid after some transformation like adding 1 to each element. But in Example0's input row6, elements5-9 are 5,5,5,8,3. Adding 1 would give 6,6,6,9,4. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: Looking for the positions of certain numbers in the output. For example, in Example0's output, the number 2 appears in the fourth position of the first row. Looking at the input, where 2 appears. In row5, element3 is 2, element12 is 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the digits from the input that are in positions where the row and column indices are multiples of certain numbers. For example, every third row and column.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as representing a larger structure, and the output is a part of it. For example, the input could be a series of concentric squares, and the output is the innermost square. But without more examples, it's hard to confirm.\n\nWait, let's look at Example1's input and output to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nExample1's input is 16 lists of 16 elements each. The output is 5 lists of 5 elements each. The first output list is [8,7,7,2,2]. Let's look at the input rows for Example1. The middle rows might be rows6-10. Let's take row6 of Example1's input: [2,7,2,7,8,7,2,8,8,2,7,8,7,2,7,2]. The elements5-9 are7,2,8,8,2. The output's first row is [8,7,7,2,2]. Not matching. \n\nAlternatively, the output might be taking elements from the middle of the input. For Example1's output first row [8,7,7,2,2], perhaps these are elements from the input row7 and columns7-11. Let's check row7 of Example1's input: [2,2,7,1,7,7,8,2,2,8,7,7,1,7,2,2]. Elements7-11:2,2,8,7,7. So [2,2,8,7,7]. But the output is [8,7,7,2,2]. This is the reverse. So maybe reversed. Reversed would be [7,7,8,2,2], which is similar to the output's first element [8,7,7,2,2]. Not exactly, but close. Perhaps a rotation or shift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a mirror image of the central section. For example, the row is reversed. The input row7's elements7-11 are [2,2,8,7,7], reversed is [7,7,8,2,2], which matches the output's first row [8,7,7,2,2] except the first element is 8 instead of7. Hmm. Not matching exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking elements from a different position. For example, in row7 of Example1's input, elements6-10:8,2,2,8,7 \u2192 [8,2,2,8,7]. Which doesn't match the output.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's try to find a different strategy.\n\nMaybe the output is the central 5 elements of the middle 5 rows. For Example0, the middle 5 rows are 6-10 (indices5-9). For each of those rows, take the central 5 elements (positions6-10 inclusive). Let's check:\n\nRow5 (index5): elements6-10:5,8,8,3,3 \u2192 [5,8,8,3,3]\n\nRow6: elements6-10:5,8,8,3,3 \u2192 [5,8,8,3,3]\n\nRow7: elements6-10:8,8,8,3,3 \u2192 [8,8,8,3,3]\n\nRow8: same as row7.\n\nRow9: same as row6.\n\nBut Example0's output is different. So this isn't the pattern.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by the fifth element of each row in the middle five rows. For Example0's rows5-9, fifth elements are:\n\nRow5:8 (element4)\n\nRow6:5 (element4)\n\nRow7:7 (element4)\n\nRow8:7 (element4)\n\nRow9:5 (element4)\n\nThis would give [8,5,7,7,5]. The output's first row is [5,8,8,2,5]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the fifth element of each of the middle five rows, then the sixth, etc. For example, first output row is elements4 of rows5-9:8,5,7,7,5 \u2192 but Example0's first output row is [5,8,8,2,5]. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a diagonal from the middle. For example, in a 16x16 grid, the central 5x5 would have diagonals. For Example0, maybe the main diagonal of the central 5x5 section. Let's see:\n\nIf central 5x5 is rows5-9 and columns5-9:\n\nRow5, column5:8\n\nRow6, column6:5\n\nRow7, column7:8\n\nRow8, column8:8\n\nRow9, column9:3\n\nSo the diagonal is [8,5,8,8,3]. Which doesn't match Example0's output.\n\nAlternatively, the anti-diagonal: row5 column9:3, row6 column8:8, row7 column7:8, row8 column6:8, row9 column5:5. So [3,8,8,8,5]. Also doesn't match.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of the examples as images, where numbers represent colors. Maybe the output is a zoomed-in or cropped version of the input's center. But without visual data, it's hard to imagine.\n\nAnother approach: The output length is 5 lists, each with 5 elements. The input has 16 lists. So the output could be the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th lists (rows) from the input, and from each of those rows, take the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th elements (columns). Let's check for Example0:\n\nRows5-9 of input:\n\nRow5: elements5-9:8,5,8,8,3 \u2192 [8,5,8,8,3]\n\nRow6:5,5,5,8,3 \u2192 [5,5,5,8,3]\n\nRow7:7,8,8,8,8 \u2192 [7,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow8:7,8,8,8,8 \u2192 [7,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow9:5,5,5,8,3 \u2192 [5,5,5,8,3]\n\nBut the output for Example0 is:\n\n[5,8,8,2,5]\n\n[5,5,5,2,5]\n\n[8,8,7,2,2]\n\n[8,8,7,2,2]\n\n[5,5,5,2,5]\n\nNone of the rows match. However, perhaps there's a transformation applied to these values. For example, subtracting 3 from each element. But 8-3=5, which matches the first output element. Let's see:\n\nRow5 elements5-9:8-3=5,5-3=2,8-3=5,8-3=5,3-3=0 \u2192 [5,2,5,5,0]. Doesn't match the first output row [5,8,8,2,5].\n\nAlternatively, maybe taking the elements modulo some number. For example, modulo 5. 8%5=3, 5%5=0, etc. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first five elements of the middle five rows. For Example0's rows5-9:\n\nRow5:5,6,5,2,8 \u2192 [5,6,5,2,8]\n\nRow6:5,5,5,2,5 \u2192 [5,5,5,2,5]\n\nRow7:6,2,2,2,7 \u2192 [6,2,2,2,7]\n\nRow8:6,2,2,2,7 \u2192 [6,2,2,2,7]\n\nRow9:5,5,5,2,5 \u2192 [5,5,5,2,5]\n\nBut Example0's output is:\n\n[5,8,8,2,5]\n\n[5,5,5,2,5]\n\n[8,8,7,2,2]\n\n[8,8,7,2,2]\n\n[5,5,5,2,5]\n\nOnly row6 and row9 match the second output row. The other rows don't. So this isn't the pattern.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let's try to look for another pattern based on the test input.\n\nThe test input has the following rows:\n\nRow4: [2,5,5,5,4,6,6,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,2]\n\nRow5: [5,5,2,2,6,6,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,5,5]\n\nRow6: [5,2,2,5,6,9,6,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,5]\n\nRow7: [5,2,5,5,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,2,5]\n\nRow8: Same as row7.\n\nRow9: [5,2,2,5,6,9,6,9,9,6,9,6,5,2,2,5]\n\nRow10: [5,5,2,2,6,6,9,9,9,9,6,6,2,2,5,5]\n\nRow11: [2,5,5,5,4,6,6,9,9,6,6,4,5,5,5,2]\n\nAssuming the output is derived from the middle five rows (rows6-10) and their middle elements. For example, rows6-10 and columns6-10. Let's see:\n\nRow6: elements5-9 are9,6,9,3,3 \u2192 [9,6,9,3,3]\n\nRow7:9,9,9,9,3 \u2192 [9,9,9,9,3]\n\nRow8: same as row7.\n\nRow9:9,6,9,6,5 \u2192 [9,6,9,6,5]\n\nRow10:6,6,9,9,9 \u2192 [6,6,9,9,9]\n\nBut the expected output for the test input might be something like:\n\n[9,9,9,9,3]\n\n[9,9,9,9,3]\n\n[9,6,9,6,5]\n\n[6,6,9,9,9]\n\nBut this is just a guess. Looking back at the training examples, Example0's output had repeated rows. The test output might have similar patterns. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the middle five elements of each of the middle five rows. For each row in rows6-10 (test input), take elements6-10. Let's check:\n\nRow6: elements6-10:9,6,9,3,3 \u2192 [9,6,9,3,3]\n\nRow7: elements6-10:9,9,9,3,3 \u2192 [9,9,9,3,3]\n\nRow8: same as row7.\n\nRow9: elements6-10:9,6,9,6,5 \u2192 [9,6,9,6,5]\n\nRow10: elements6-10:9,9,9,9,6 \u2192 [9,9,9,9,6]\n\nBut the training examples' outputs don't have 3s, so this might not be correct. But the test input's output might need to exclude the 3s. So perhaps the elements before the 3s. For example, in row6 of test input, the 3s start at element8. So elements5-9 are6,9,6,9,3 \u2192 [6,9,6,9,3]. Taking elements before the 3 would give [6,9,6,9], which is four elements. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the first five elements after the initial sequence. For example, in row6 of test input, the elements after the initial 5,2,2,5,6,9,6,9 are 3s. So perhaps the output is the elements before the 3s. But this varies per row.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let's try to make an educated guess based on the training examples. \n\nIn Example0, the output lists have 5 elements each. The middle row of the output is [8,8,7,2,2], which appears twice. Looking at the input, perhaps this corresponds to the central rows which are identical (rows7 and 8). So maybe the output rows correspond to the middle rows of the input, and their elements are taken from certain positions.\n\nFor the test input, the middle rows are rows7 and 8 (indices7 and 8), which are identical: [5,2,5,5,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,2,5]. Perhaps the output's middle rows are derived from these. The elements before the 3s are9,9,9,9. But the output needs 5 elements.\n\nAlternatively, taking elements4-8 (9,9,9,9,3). But Example0's output has 2s and 7s which are not present here.\n\nAnother observation: In the training examples, the outputs have certain numbers that are present in the input but arranged differently. For example, Example0's output includes 5, 8, 2, 7. These numbers are present in the middle rows of the input. Maybe the output is a compression or a pattern formed by certain elements in the input.\n\nGiven that I'm running out of time and need to provide an answer, I'll make a guess based on the following:\n\nLooking at Example0's output, the first and last rows are similar to the second row. The middle three rows have higher numbers. The test input's middle rows (7 and 8) have many 9s and 5s. Perhaps the output for the test input is something like:\n\n[9,9,9,9,3]\n\n[9,9,9,9,3]\n\n[9,9,9,9,3]\n\n[9,9,9,9,3]\n\n[9,9,9,9,3]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs don't have repeated rows like this. Example0 has two identical middle rows. So perhaps the test output's middle rows are the same. Looking at the test input's rows7 and 8, which are identical. Maybe the output will have those elements. For example, elements4-8:9,9,9,9,3. But this is five elements. If the output is formed by taking elements4-8 of the middle rows (rows6-10):\n\nRow6: elements4-8:6,9,6,9,3 \u2192 [6,9,6,9,3]\n\nRow7: elements4-8:9,9,9,9,3 \u2192 [9,9,9,9,3]\n\nRow8: same as row7 \u2192 [9,9,9,9,3]\n\nRow9: elements4-8:6,9,6,9,9 \u2192 [6,9,6,9,9]\n\nRow10: elements4-8:6,6,9,9,9 \u2192 [6,6,9,9,9]\n\nBut how does this relate to the training examples? Example0's output includes elements like 5,8,2. The test input's output could be:\n\n[6,9,6,9,3]\n\n[9,9,9,9,3]\n\n[9,9,9,9,3]\n\n[6,9,6,9,9]\n\n[6,6,9,9,9]\n\nBut this doesn't match the structure of the training examples' outputs. \n\nAnother guess: The output is the central 5 elements of the middle 5 rows. For each row, elements6-10 (indices5-9). For the test input's rows6-10:\n\nRow6:5,2,2,5,6,9,6,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,5 \u2192 elements5-9:9,6,9,3,3 \u2192 [9,6,9,3,3]\n\nRow7:5,2,5,5,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,2,5 \u2192 elements5-9:9,9,9,9,3 \u2192 [9,9,9,9,3]\n\nRow8: same as row7 \u2192 [9,9,9,9,3]\n\nRow9:5,2,2,5,6,9,6,9,9,6,9,6,5,2,2,5 \u2192 elements5-9:9,6,9,9,6 \u2192 [9,6,9,9,6]\n\nRow10:5,5,2,2,6,6,9,9,9,9,6,6,2,2,5,5 \u2192 elements5-9:6,9,9,9,9 \u2192 [6,9,9,9,9]\n\nBut the output needs to be 5 lists of 5 elements each. This would give:\n\n[9,6,9,3,3]\n\n[9,9,9,9,3]\n\n[9,9,9,9,3]\n\n[9,6,9,9,6]\n\n[6,9,9,9,9]\n\nBut this doesn't align with the training examples' pattern. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll hazard a guess that the output is the central 5 elements of the middle 5 rows, and for the test input, that would be:\n\nFor rows6-10 (indices5-9), elements5-9:\n\nRow5 (index5):5,5,2,2,6 \u2192 elements5-9:2,6,6,9,3 \u2192 [6,6,9,9,3]\n\nWait, row5 of the test input is [5,5,2,2,6,6,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,5,5]. elements5-9:6,9,9,3,3 \u2192 [6,9,9,3,3]\n\nRow6: elements5-9:9,6,9,3,3 \u2192 [9,6,9,3,3]\n\nRow7: elements5-9:9,9,9,9,3 \u2192 [9,9,9,9,3]\n\nRow8: same as row7 \u2192 [9,9,9,9,3]\n\nRow9: elements5-9:9,6,9,9,6 \u2192 [9,6,9,9,6]\n\nSo the central 5x5 would be:\n\n[6,9,9,3,3]\n\n[9,6,9,3,3]\n\n[9,9,9,9,3]\n\n[9,9,9,9,3]\n\n[9,6,9,9,6]\n\nBut this still doesn't match the training examples' outputs. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the first five elements of each of the middle five rows. For test input:\n\nRow6:5,2,2,5,6 \u2192 [5,2,2,5,6]\n\nRow7:5,2,5,5,9 \u2192 [5,2,5,5,9]\n\nRow8: same as row7 \u2192 [5,2,5,5,9]\n\nRow9:5,2,2,5,6 \u2192 [5,2,2,5,6]\n\nRow10:5,5,2,2,6 \u2192 [5,5,2,2,6]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples either.\n\nGiven that I can't discern the exact pattern, I'll make an educated guess based on the structure of the training examples. In Example0's output, the middle rows have elements like 8,8,7,2,2, which might correspond to the central elements of the input rows. For the test input's middle rows (row7 and 8), the central elements are 9,9,9,9,3. But the output examples don't have 3s, so maybe the output is derived by taking elements before the 3s. For row7 of the test input, elements before the 3s are 9,9,9,9. To get five elements, maybe including the first 9 and four more from before the 3s. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and lack of progress, I'll proceed to provide an answer based on the assumption that the output is the central 5 elements of the middle 5 rows, reversed. For the test input, this would be:\n\nFor rows6-10 (indices5-9), elements5-9 reversed:\n\nRow5: [6,9,9,3,3] reversed \u2192 [3,3,9,9,6]\n\nRow6: [9,6,9,3,3] reversed \u2192 [3,3,9,6,9]\n\nRow7: [9,9,9,9,3] reversed \u2192 [3,9,9,9,9]\n\nRow8: same as row7 \u2192 [3,9,9,9,9]\n\nRow9: [9,6,9,9,6] reversed \u2192 [6,9,9,6,9]\n\nBut this doesn't match the training examples' structure. Therefore, my final guess is that the output is derived by taking elements from the middle of each row, possibly the elements before the run of 3s, and the test output would be:\n\n[6,6,9,9,3]\n\n[9,9,9,9,3]\n\n[9,9,9,9,3]\n\n[9,6,9,9,6]\n\n[6,6,9,9,9]\n\nBut this is purely a guess. However, based on the training examples, the output seems to have fewer 3s, so perhaps the 3s are ignored, and the output takes the five elements before the 3s. For example, in row5 of test input, the 3s start at element9. The five elements before that are elements4-8:6,6,9,9,3. But this includes a 3, which might be excluded. So taking elements4-8:6,6,9,9,3 \u2192 [6,6,9,9,3]. But the output examples have 3s in the last position, so maybe this is correct.\n\nBut this is not aligning with the training examples. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll go with the following output based on the assumption that the output is the middle 5 elements of the middle 5 rows, possibly excluding 3s or taking certain positions.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the input and output examples and determine the transformation that maps the input to the output. Then apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at the training examples:\n\nIn Example 0, the input is a 16-element list of lists (since each line is a list). The output is a list of five elements. Let's see. Maybe each output list is derived from a row in the input. But how?\n\nWait, the input in Example 0 has 16 rows (since each INPUT line is a row). The output has 5 elements. So maybe the output is a subset of the input rows? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the first input of Example 0, the first row is [2,1,2,2,6,5,5,6,6,5,5,6,2,2,1,2]. The output is [5,8,8,2,5], etc. Hmm. Not sure. Maybe the outputs are taken from the middle rows? For example, in Example 0, the output has 5 rows. The input has 16 rows. Let's see: the outputs might be rows 4 to 8. Wait:\n\nIn Example 0's input, rows 4 to 8 are:\n\n[6,5,5,6,5,8,5,7,7,5,8,5,6,5,5,6] \u2192 row 4\n\n[5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,5] \u2192 row5\n\n[5,5,5,2,5,5,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,5,5] \u2192 row6\n\n[6,2,2,2,7,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,2,6] \u2192 row7\n\n[6,2,2,2,7,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,2,6] \u2192 row8\n\nBut the output of Example 0 is:\n\n[5,8,8,2,5]\n\n[5,5,5,2,5]\n\n[8,8,7,2,2]\n\n[8,8,7,2,2]\n\n[5,5,5,2,5]\n\nWait, how do these correspond to the input rows? Let's look at the fifth input row (row5 in 0-based indexing, since the first is 0). The input row5 is [5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,5]. But the first output in example 0 is [5,8,8,2,5]. Hmm, maybe taking certain elements from the row. Let's check:\n\nLooking at row5: elements 0 is 5, element 4 is 8, element5 is 8, element3 is 2, element 15 is5. So 5,8,8,2,5. Which matches the first output line. Oh! So perhaps for each row in the output, it's taking the first element, then elements 4,5,3, and last element. Let me check this.\n\nWait, in example 0's output, the first line is [5,8,8,2,5]. The input row5 (index5) is [5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,5]. So first element is 5, then elements 4 and 5 are 8 and 8, element3 is 2, last element is5. So yes, that's 0th,4th,5th,3rd,15th indices. So positions 0,4,5,3,15.\n\nLet me check the next output line in example0: [5,5,5,2,5]. The next input row (row6) is [5,5,5,2,5,5,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,5,5]. So first element is5, elements4 and5 are5 and5, element3 is2, last element5. So output would be [5,5,5,2,5]. Which matches. Then row7: [6,2,2,2,7,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,2,6]. Applying the same: 6,7,8,2,6. But the output is [8,8,7,2,2]. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the output rows are not in the same order as the input rows. Alternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking specific columns from the input matrix. Let's think of the input as a 16x16 grid (since each row has 16 elements). Then the output is a 5x5 grid. So perhaps the output is a central 5x5 section of the input.\n\nBut the input in example0 has 16 rows. If we take the middle 5 rows (rows 5-9?), but that doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe the output is the 5 middle rows of the input, and then taking certain elements from those rows.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs in example0, the first element of each output line is 5,5,8,8,5. Let's check which rows those correspond to. The first output line is from input row5: 5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,5. Then the output is [5,8,8,2,5]. Wait, maybe taking the first element, then the 4th,5th,3rd, and last element. Let's see:\n\nRow5: elements 0 (5), 4 (8),5(8),3(2),15(5). So [5,8,8,2,5]. That works.\n\nRow6: elements 0(5),4(5),5(5),3(2),15(5) \u2192 [5,5,5,2,5]. Which matches the second output.\n\nRow7: elements 0(6),4(7),5(8),3(2),15(6). But the output is [8,8,7,2,2]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is formed by taking the middle 5 elements of each row. But each input row is 16 elements. The middle 5 would be positions 6-10? But the output in example0 first line is 5 elements. Let's check:\n\nRow5 of example0: elements 6-10 are 5,8,8,3,3. The output is [5,8,8,2,5]. So that doesn't match.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is formed by taking elements from certain positions in the input rows. For example, in example0, the outputs have 5 elements. Let's see for the first output line: [5,8,8,2,5]. The input row5 has elements:\n\nIndices 0:5, 4:8, 5:8, 3:2, 15:5. So those positions. So 0,4,5,3,15.\n\nWait, that gives 5,8,8,2,5. Which matches. Let's check the next output line: [5,5,5,2,5]. The input row6 has elements 0(5),4(5),5(5),3(2),15(5) \u2192 5,5,5,2,5. Which matches.\n\nThen row7: [6,2,2,2,7,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,2,6]. Applying the same: 0(6),4(7),5(8),3(2),15(6). So output would be [6,7,8,2,6], but the actual output is [8,8,7,2,2]. Hmm, not matching. So maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the rows selected are from the middle of the input. For example, in example0, the input has 16 rows. The output has 5 rows. So maybe rows 5 to 9 (0-based) of the input are selected. Let's check:\n\nExample0's output has 5 rows. The input rows 5-9 are:\n\nRow5: [5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,5]\n\nRow6: [5,5,5,2,5,5,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,5,5]\n\nRow7: [6,2,2,2,7,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,2,6]\n\nRow8: same as row7.\n\nRow9: [5,5,5,2,5,5,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,5,5]\n\nBut the output rows are:\n\n[5,8,8,2,5]\n\n[5,5,5,2,5]\n\n[8,8,7,2,2]\n\n[8,8,7,2,2]\n\n[5,5,5,2,5]\n\nWait, how do these correspond? For row5 in input, the output is [5,8,8,2,5]. Let's see the elements in row5:\n\nIndices 0:5, 4:8,5:8,3:2, 15:5 \u2192 same as before. So maybe for each selected row (rows5,6,7,8,9?), we take elements 0,4,5,3,15. Then, the output is made of these elements for each selected row.\n\nBut then row7's output would be [6,7,8,2,6], but the actual output for row7's corresponding line is [8,8,7,2,2]. That doesn't fit. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is generated by taking the 5th to 9th rows (inclusive) and then taking the 5th element from each of those rows. Wait, but each output row has 5 elements. Alternatively, maybe each output row is a column in the input. For example, the output is columns 5-9 of rows 5-9. But that's 5x5. Let's check.\n\nIn example0, input rows 5-9. Let's take columns 5-9 of each. For row5: columns5-9 are [8,5,8,8,3]. But the output for the first line is [5,8,8,2,5]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the center 5x5 grid. The input is 16x16, so the center rows would be 6-10 (0-based) and columns 6-10. Let's see. For example, row5 in the input (assuming rows are 0-15) and columns 6-10: in row5, columns6-10 are [5,8,8,3,3]. But the output's first line is [5,8,8,2,5]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's look for another pattern. Maybe the output is formed by the elements that are in the positions where the original elements are part of a certain pattern. For instance, in the input, the outputs might be elements that are part of a cross or a diamond shape.\n\nAlternatively, considering the test input's structure. Let's look at the test input's rows. For example, the test input has 16 rows, each of 16 elements. The outputs need to be 5 elements each, forming a 5-element list.\n\nWait, in the test input, looking at the middle rows:\n\nRows 4 to 8 (0-based) in the test input:\n\nRow4: [2,5,5,5,4,6,6,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,2]\n\nRow5: [5,5,2,2,6,6,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,5,5]\n\nRow6: [5,2,2,5,6,9,6,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,5]\n\nRow7: [5,2,5,5,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,2,5]\n\nRow8: same as row7.\n\nIf the pattern is similar to the training examples, maybe the output would take elements from these rows. For example, if in example0, the output rows are rows5-9, then in the test input, maybe the output is rows4-8, or 5-9.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs of the training examples:\n\nIn Example0, the output has 5 rows, each with 5 elements. Example1's output also has 5 rows of 5 elements. So the output is a 5x5 matrix. So perhaps the input is a 16x16 grid, and the output is a 5x5 grid taken from the center.\n\nBut how to confirm that. Let's check example0. The input is 16x16. The center would be around rows 6-10 (since 16 rows, the middle is 8, so maybe rows 5-9?), and columns 6-10.\n\nIn example0, input row5 (0-based) is [5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,5]. Columns6-10 would be [5,8,8,3,3]. But the first output row is [5,8,8,2,5], which doesn't match. So maybe not.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe each output row is formed by taking the 5 elements from the middle of each input row, but offset in some way. For example, for each input row, take elements 5 to 9 (0-based), which are 5 elements. Let's check in example0.\n\nRow5: elements5-9 are [8,5,8,8,3]. Output is [5,8,8,2,5]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. The examples have outputs that are 5 rows each. Each output row is 5 elements. Maybe each output row is formed by taking elements from specific positions in the input rows, perhaps positions that form a cross. For example, the middle element and the two adjacent. But how.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in the training examples, the outputs seem to be taking certain elements from the middle parts of the input.\n\nLooking at example0's output, the first line is [5,8,8,2,5]. Let me check the input row5 again: [5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,5]. The elements 0 (5), 4 (8),5 (8), 3 (2), and 15 (5). So that's first element, fourth, fifth, third, and last. That's 0,4,5,3,15. Let me check if that holds for the other rows.\n\nRow6: [5,5,5,2,5,5,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,5,5]. 0 is5,4 is5,5 is5,3 is2,15 is5. So [5,5,5,2,5], which matches the second output line.\n\nRow7: [6,2,2,2,7,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,2,6]. Elements 0(6),4(7),5(8),3(2),15(6). So output should be [6,7,8,2,6], but the third output line is [8,8,7,2,2]. Doesn't match. So maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nWait, maybe it's not the same positions for each row. Or maybe it's a different selection. Let's look at the third output line of example0: [8,8,7,2,2]. Looking at row7: [6,2,2,2,7,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,2,6]. Where do 8,8,7,2,2 come from? Let's see:\n\nRow7 elements:\n\nIndices 5:8,6:8,4:7,3:2, and 2:2. So that would be elements5,6,4,3,2. So [8,8,7,2,2]. Which matches the output. So for row7, the positions are 5,6,4,3,2.\n\nHmm. So for row5, the positions are 0,4,5,3,15. For row6:0,4,5,3,15. For row7:5,6,4,3,2. Wait, that's inconsistent. So maybe the selection depends on the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the output elements. For example, the first output line is [5,8,8,2,5]. Let's see if these numbers appear in the input row5. Yes: 5 at start, 8 at positions4 and5, 2 at position3, 5 at end. So the output is combining these elements. But why these particular positions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the first element, then the two elements after the middle, then the third element, then the last element. Wait, the input rows are 16 elements long. The middle would be around index7 and 8. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by elements from specific columns. For example, column0, column4, column5, column3, column15. Because in example0's first output line, that's what's happening. Let's check:\n\nIf columns are 0,4,5,3,15, then for each row in the input, taking those columns gives the output. Let's see for example0:\n\nRow5 (input row5) columns0:5,4:8,5:8,3:2,15:5 \u2192 [5,8,8,2,5]. Correct.\n\nRow6: columns0:5,4:5,5:5,3:2,15:5 \u2192 [5,5,5,2,5]. Correct.\n\nRow7: columns0:6,4:7,5:8,3:2,15:6 \u2192 [6,7,8,2,6]. But the output for row7 is [8,8,7,2,2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo perhaps this idea is incorrect. Unless the columns change for certain rows. But that complicates things.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is formed by taking the 5th row to the 9th row of the input and selecting certain elements from each of those rows.\n\nIn example0, the output has 5 rows. The input rows selected are rows5-9 (assuming 0-based), and for each of these rows, certain elements are selected. But how?\n\nLooking at the third output line in example0: [8,8,7,2,2]. Let's see which input row this comes from. The input row7 is [6,2,2,2,7,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,2,6]. So how do we get [8,8,7,2,2] from this row? Looking at elements5 and6 are 8 and8, element4 is7, elements3 is2, elements2 is2. So elements5,6,4,3,2: [8,8,7,2,2]. So positions5,6,4,3,2.\n\nSimilarly, row8 is same as row7, so the output would be the same.\n\nRow9: [5,5,5,2,5,5,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,5,5]. Applying the same positions (5,6,4,3,2): elements5 is5,6 is5,4 is5,3 is2,2 is5 \u2192 [5,5,5,2,5]. Which matches the fifth output line of example0.\n\nWait, this seems to work. So the pattern might be:\n\nFor rows5,6,7,8,9 of the input:\n\n- For row5 and row6: select elements0,4,5,3,15.\n\n- For rows7 and 8: select elements5,6,4,3,2.\n\n- For row9: back to elements0,4,5,3,15.\n\nBut why the difference? Maybe it's based on the row's position. For example, rows5 and6 (middle-upper), then rows7 and8 (middle), and row9 (middle-lower). But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the selection depends on the row's index. Let's check the indices.\n\nIn example0:\n\nRows5,6,7,8,9.\n\nFor rows5 and6 (indices5 and6):\n\nElements selected are0,4,5,3,15.\n\nFor rows7 and8 (indices7 and8):\n\nElements selected are5,6,4,3,2.\n\nFor row9 (index9):\n\nElements selected are0,4,5,3,15.\n\nHmm, this seems inconsistent. Maybe there's a different logic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the selection is based on the row's content. For example, in row5 and row6, there's a sequence of 3,3,3,3,3 starting at position9. Maybe the selection is based on the position where the number 3 appears.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the elements before the sequence of 3s and then some others. Let's see.\n\nIn example0's row5: [5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,5]. The sequence of 3s starts at position9. The elements before that are positions0-8. The output is elements0,4,5,3,15. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be taking the elements from the positions that are not part of the 3s. But this is vague.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at example0's output:\n\nThe first line is [5,8,8,2,5]. Notice that 5,8,8,2,5 corresponds to elements in row5: 0,4,5,3,15.\n\nThe second line is [5,5,5,2,5] from row6's elements0,4,5,3,15.\n\nThe third and fourth lines are [8,8,7,2,2] from rows7 and8's elements5,6,4,3,2.\n\nThe fifth line is [5,5,5,2,5] from row9's elements0,4,5,3,15.\n\nSo perhaps for even-numbered rows in the output (assuming output rows are 0-4), rows0,1,4 use elements0,4,5,3,15, and rows2 and3 use elements5,6,4,3,2.\n\nBut why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a diamond pattern. Let's imagine the input rows as a 16x16 grid, and the output is a diamond-shaped area. For example, the output rows correspond to the central rows, and the columns selected vary depending on the row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the elements that form a cross in the input grid. For instance, the center of the input is a cross shape, and each output row is a line of the cross.\n\nBut I need a different approach. Let's check example1's output to see if the same pattern holds.\n\nExample1's input has 16 rows. Let's look at the output for example1:\n\nOutput is:\n\n[8,7,7,2,2]\n\n[9,7,1,7,2]\n\n[2,2,7,2,7]\n\n[9,2,2,7,1]\n\n[2,2,7,8,7]\n\nLet's see if these come from rows5-9 of the input.\n\nInput rows5-9 of example1:\n\nRow5: [7,1,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,1,7]\n\nRow6: [2,7,2,7,8,7,2,8,8,2,7,8,7,2,7,2]\n\nRow7: [2,2,7,1,7,7,8,2,2,8,7,7,1,7,2,2]\n\nRow8: same as row7.\n\nRow9: [2,7,2,7,8,7,2,8,8,2,7,8,7,2,7,2]\n\nNow, let's check the output lines.\n\nFirst output line: [8,7,7,2,2]. Which row does this come from? Looking at row6: [2,7,2,7,8,7,2,8,8,2,7,8,7,2,7,2]. If the selection is elements4,5,3,7,8? Not sure. Alternatively, elements4 is8,5 is7,3 is7, 7 is8, 8 is8. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's using the same pattern as example0. For rows5-9:\n\nFor example, the first output line in example1 could be from row5: [7,1,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,1,7]. If we take elements0,4,5,3,15: 7,7,2,2,7. But the output is [8,7,7,2,2]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for row6 in example1, taking elements5,6,4,3,2:\n\nRow6 elements: indices5 is7,6 is2,4 is8,3 is7,2 is2. So [7,2,8,7,2]. Not matching output [8,7,7,2,2].\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In example0's output, the middle three rows are the same. The first and last row are the same. Maybe this indicates that the output is symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of certain elements from the input's center. For example, the first output line in example0 is formed by elements from row5, column4, row5, column5, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row corresponds to a diagonal in the input matrix. For example, the first output row is the main diagonal of the 5x5 center of the input. But this would require checking a lot of elements.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as a square, and the output is a smaller square taken from the center. For instance, a 5x5 grid from the center of the 16x16 input. Let's check:\n\nIn example0, the center of the input would be rows6-10 and columns6-10. So for example, row6's columns6-10: [5,8,8,3,3]. But the output's third line is [8,8,7,2,2], which doesn't match. So this approach may not work.\n\nAnother idea: The output rows in example0 have elements 5,8,8,2,5. Looking at the input row5, the number 8 appears at positions4,5,7,8. The number 5 appears at0,2,6,15. The number2 is at3. So maybe the output is taking the first occurrence of 5, then the two 8s, then the 2, then the last 5. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sequence of numbers from the input row that are between the 5th element and the 3s. For example, in row5 of example0: elements after the 5th (8) and before the 3s start (position9). So elements4-8:8,8,5,8,8. But the output is [5,8,8,2,5], which doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's try to look for another angle.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest input has 16 rows. The output should be 5 rows. Let's imagine that the pattern involves selecting certain rows from the input and then certain elements from those rows.\n\nFor example, in example0, the output is rows5-9. Let's assume that the test input's output is also rows5-9. But in example0, the output is rows5-9 (0-based). Let's see:\n\nTest input's row5: [5,5,2,2,6,6,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,5,5]\n\nRow6: [5,2,2,5,6,9,6,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,5]\n\nRow7: [5,2,5,5,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,2,5]\n\nRow8: same as row7.\n\nRow9: [5,2,2,5,6,9,6,9,9,6,9,6,5,2,2,5]\n\nIf the output is formed by taking elements0,4,5,3,15 from each of these rows:\n\nRow5: elements0(5),4(6),5(6),3(2),15(5) \u2192 [5,6,6,2,5]\n\nRow6: elements0(5),4(6),5(9),3(5),15(5) \u2192 [5,6,9,5,5]\n\nRow7: elements0(5),4(9),5(9),3(5),15(5) \u2192 [5,9,9,5,5]\n\nRow8: same as row7 \u2192 [5,9,9,5,5]\n\nRow9: elements0(5),4(6),5(9),3(5),15(5) \u2192 [5,6,9,5,5]\n\nBut the test input's expected output (based on training examples) is unknown. However, comparing this to the training examples, perhaps the output for the test case would be:\n\nLet's assume the same pattern as example0 and example1. For example, in example0's row5, the output is formed by elements0,4,5,3,15. For rows7 and8, elements5,6,4,3,2.\n\nIn the test input's rows5-9:\n\nRow5: [5,5,2,2,6,6,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,5,5]\n\nIf we take elements0,4,5,3,15 \u2192 5,6,6,2,5 \u2192 [5,6,6,2,5]\n\nRow6: [5,2,2,5,6,9,6,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,5]\n\nSame approach: 5,6,9,5,5 \u2192 [5,6,9,5,5]\n\nRow7: [5,2,5,5,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,2,5]\n\nElements0(5),4(9),5(9),3(5),15(5) \u2192 [5,9,9,5,5]\n\nRow8: same as row7 \u2192 [5,9,9,5,5]\n\nRow9: [5,2,2,5,6,9,6,9,9,6,9,6,5,2,2,5]\n\nElements0(5),4(6),5(9),3(5),15(5) \u2192 [5,6,9,5,5]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the training example outputs. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, for rows7 and8, maybe take elements5,6,4,3,2.\n\nFor test input row7: elements5(9),6(9),4(9),3(5),2(5) \u2192 [9,9,9,5,5]. But how does this fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the elements that are in positions where the number 3 appears in the input. For example, in example0's row5, the sequence of 3s starts at position9. Maybe the elements before the 3s are considered. But the output for row5 in example0 is [5,8,8,2,5], which includes elements before the 3s (positions0-8), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements are the non-3 elements in certain positions. For example, in example0's row5, the elements after the 3s are ignored. So taking elements0-8 (excluding 3s), but this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at the output elements, perhaps they are the unique numbers in each row that are not part of the trailing 3s. For example, in example0's row5: the trailing 3s start at position9, so elements0-8 are [5,6,5,2,8,8,5,8,8]. The output is [5,8,8,2,5]. Maybe selecting the first 5 elements after removing duplicates and excluding certain numbers. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first occurrence of each number in the row, but limited to 5 elements. But example0's row5 has 5 as the first element, then6, then5 again. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the numbers in the row that are not 3. But in example0's row5, the output is [5,8,8,2,5], which are the non-3 elements in the row but only taking five of them. But this is not systematic.\n\nAnother idea: The outputs in example0 and example1 have some recurring elements. For example, the first output line of example0 has elements5,8,8,2,5. The numbers 8 and 2 might be connected to their positions in the input. Maybe the output is formed by elements that are in the same position relative to a central point. For example, the center of the input is at (8,8), and the output elements are selected based on their distance from the center.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Perhaps the pattern is that for the middle five rows of the input (rows5-9), for each of these rows, take the elements that are in positions where there's a change from non-3 to 3. For example, in row5 of example0, the 3s start at position9. So before that, in position8, it's 8, then positions9-15 are3,3,3,3,3,6,5. So the elements before the 3s are up to position8. Then, perhaps take elements 4,5,3, and others.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input's row5: [5,5,2,2,6,6,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,5,5]. The 3s start at position8. So elements0-7 are5,5,2,2,6,6,9,9. Maybe the output is the first five elements of this: [5,5,2,2,6]. But the example0's output doesn't fit this pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In example0's output, the first and fifth elements of each output line are the same. For example, the first line is [5,8,8,2,5], last element5. The second line is [5,5,5,2,5], last element5. The third and fourth lines have last element2. The fifth line again 5. So perhaps the first and last elements are the same as the first and last elements of the input row.\n\nBut in example0's row5, first is5, last is5. Output's first and last are5 and5. For row7, first is6, last is6. But output's first element8, last element2. So this doesn't hold.\n\nAlternative idea: The output is the sequence of numbers in the input row that are between the first occurrence of 3 and the end, but this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking elements from the input rows that are in the same positions as the digits in the output. For example, in example0's output line1, the elements are5,8,8,2,5. In the input row5, these elements are at positions0,4,5,3,15. Maybe these positions correspond to the indices where those numbers appear in the output.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions in the input row that form a certain pattern. For example, the first element is the first element of the row, then the next two are the fifth and sixth elements, then the fourth, and then the last. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother angle: The number of elements in the output is5. So each output row has5 elements. The input rows have 16 elements. Perhaps the output is taking elements at positions 0, 4, 5, 3, and 15 (as per example0). Let's test this with example1.\n\nExample1's first output line is [8,7,7,2,2]. Let's check which row this comes from. If it's row5 of example1's input:\n\nRow5 of example1's input: [7,1,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,1,7]. Taking elements0,4,5,3,15:7,7,2,2,7. Output line is [8,7,7,2,2]. Doesn't match. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions are different for each example. For example, in example0, the positions are0,4,5,3,15. In example1, different positions. But this would make the pattern too variable.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's check the test input's middle rows and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nTest input's row4: [2,5,5,5,4,6,6,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,2]\n\nRow5: [5,5,2,2,6,6,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,5,5]\n\nRow6: [5,2,2,5,6,9,6,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,5]\n\nRow7: [5,2,5,5,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,2,5]\n\nRow8: same as row7.\n\nRow9: [5,2,2,5,6,9,6,9,9,6,9,6,5,2,2,5]\n\nRow10: [5,5,2,2,6,6,9,9,9,9,6,6,2,2,5,5]\n\nRow11: [2,5,5,5,4,6,6,9,9,6,6,4,5,5,5,2]\n\nRow12: [5,5,8,5,5,2,5,5,5,5,2,5,5,8,5,5]\n\nRow13: [2,2,5,8,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,8,5,2,2]\n\nRow14: [5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5]\n\nRow15: [5,5,2,5,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,5,2,5,5]\n\nAssuming the output is rows4-8 of the test input, then for each of these rows, we need to extract 5 elements. But how?\n\nIn example0 and example1, the outputs seem to be taking elements from the parts of the input rows that are not the trailing 3s. For example, in example0's row5, before the 3s start at position9, we have elements0-8. Maybe the output is taking elements from positions0,4,5,3, and the last element before the 3s start. For example, in example0's row5, the last element before the 3s is8 at position8. So elements0,4,5,3,8 \u2192 5,8,8,2,8. But the output is [5,8,8,2,5]. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the last element before the 3s is8 (position8), but the output's last element is5 (position15). This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be the first element, the two elements before the 3s start, then the third element, and the last element. For example, in example0's row5, the 3s start at position9. So elements0,7,8,3,15. Elements7 is8,8 is8. So [5,8,8,2,5], which matches.\n\nYes! Let's test this:\n\nFor example0's row5: 3s start at position9. So elements before are 0-8. Take elements0 (5), then positions7 (8),8 (8), then position3 (2), then last element15 (5). So [5,8,8,2,5]. Which matches.\n\nRow6 in example0: 3s start at position9. Elements0-8 are [5,5,5,2,5,5,5,8,8]. Taking elements0(5),7(8),8(8),3(2),15(5) \u2192 [5,8,8,2,5]. But the output for row6 is [5,5,5,2,5]. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, no. For row6 in example0: [5,5,5,2,5,5,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,5,5]. The 3s start at position9. The elements before are positions0-8: [5,5,5,2,5,5,5,8,8]. So elements0 is5,7 is8,8 is8,3 is2,15 is5. So output would be [5,8,8,2,5]. But the actual output for row6 is [5,5,5,2,5]. So this doesn't fit. Therefore, this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut this idea might work for some rows and not others. Perhaps the pattern is that for each row in the input, the output is the first element, the two elements before the start of the 3s, the third element, and the last element. But this seems too variable.\n\nAnother observation: In the training examples, the outputs often have elements that are repeated. For example, example0's output has 8,8,7,2,2. This suggests that there's a symmetry or repetition in the selected elements.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern based on the position of the first occurrence of the number3 in each row. For example, in example0's row5, the 3s start at position9. The elements before are 0-8. So taking elements0,4,5,3,8 (which are5,8,8,2,8). But output is [5,8,8,2,5], which doesn't match. So maybe taking elements0,4,5,3, and the last element before the 3s start (position8 is8). Then the output would be [5,8,8,2,8]. But the actual output is [5,8,8,2,5]. So the last element is the last element of the row, not the one before the 3s.\n\nThis approach doesn't hold.\n\nAt this point, I'm struggling to find a consistent pattern. Let me try to summarize what I know:\n\n- Each output row has5 elements.\n\n- The output rows are taken from the middle part of the input (rows5-9 in example0 and example1).\n\n- For each of these rows, certain elements are selected, possibly based on their position relative to other elements (like the start of 3s).\n\n- The elements selected seem to include the first element, then elements from the middle of the row, then the third element, and the last element.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make an educated guess based on the examples. In example0 and example1, the outputs seem to take elements from the middle rows of the input and pick elements0,4,5,3,15 for some rows, and elements5,6,4,3,2 for others. However, without a clear pattern, this is difficult. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the elements that are in the same position as the central 5x5 grid of the 16x16 input. For example, rows6-10 and columns6-10. But each output row has5 elements, which could correspond to these columns. Let's check example0:\n\nRow6 of input example0 is [5,5,5,2,5,5,5,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,5,5]. Columns6-10 are5,8,8,3,3. The output for row6 is [5,5,5,2,5], which doesn't match. So this is incorrect.\n\nFinal guess: The output is formed by taking rows5-9 of the input, and for each of these rows, taking the elements at positions0,4,5,3,15. Let's apply this to the test input.\n\nTest input's rows5-9:\n\nRow5: [5,5,2,2,6,6,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,5,5]\n\nElements0:5,4:6,5:6,3:2,15:5 \u2192 [5,6,6,2,5]\n\nRow6: [5,2,2,5,6,9,6,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,5]\n\nElements0:5,4:6,5:9,3:5,15:5 \u2192 [5,6,9,5,5]\n\nRow7: [5,2,5,5,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,2,5]\n\nElements0:5,4:9,5:9,3:5,15:5 \u2192 [5,9,9,5,5]\n\nRow8: same as row7 \u2192 [5,9,9,5,5]\n\nRow9: [5,2,2,5,6,9,6,9,9,6,9,6,5,2,2,5]\n\nElements0:5,4:6,5:9,3:5,15:5 \u2192 [5,6,9,5,5]\n\nBut the expected output might have different elements. For example, if the output for the test input is:\n\n[5,6,6,2,5]\n\n[5,6,9,5,5]\n\n[5,9,9,5,5]\n\n[5,9,9,5,5]\n\n[5,6,9,5,5]\n\nBut this doesn't match the structure of the training examples. Alternatively, maybe for rows7 and8, a different set of elements is chosen. For example, in example0's rows7 and8, elements5,6,4,3,2 are chosen. For test input's row7:\n\nRow7: [5,2,5,5,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,2,5]\n\nElements5:9,6:9,4:9,3:5,2:5 \u2192 [9,9,9,5,5]\n\nIf this is part of the output, but the training examples have varying patterns, it's hard to be certain.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think the best guess is that for each of the middle 5 rows (rows5-9) of the input, the output is formed by taking elements0,4,5,3,15. Applying this to the test input's rows5-9:\n\nRow5: [5,6,6,2,5]\n\nRow6: [5,6,9,5,5]\n\nRow7: [5,9,9,5,5]\n\nRow8: [5,9,9,5,5]\n\nRow9: [5,6,9,5,5]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the training examples' outputs. However, looking at example0's output, the third and fourth lines are [8,8,7,2,2]. These come from rows7 and8. Applying the same logic as before, perhaps for rows7 and8, elements5,6,4,3,2 are taken. Let's try this for test input's rows7 and8:\n\nRow7: elements5(9),6(9),4(9),3(5),2(5) \u2192 [9,9,9,5,5]\n\nRow8: same as row7 \u2192 [9,9,9,5,5]\n\nSo combining all:\n\nRow5: [5,6,6,2,5]\n\nRow6: [5,6,9,5,5]\n\nRow7: [9,9,9,5,5]\n\nRow8: [9,9,9,5,5]\n\nRow9: [5,6,9,5,5]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. However, based on the training examples, the output for the test case might look like:\n\n[5,6,6,2,5]\n\n[5,6,9,5,5]\n\n[9,9,9,5,5]\n\n[9,9,9,5,5]\n\n[5,6,9,5,5]\n\nBut this is a guess. Alternatively, the output might be similar to example0's output, where certain rows have different element selections. For example, rows5 and6 use elements0,4,5,3,15; rows7 and8 use elements5,6,4,3,2; row9 uses elements0,4,5,3,15.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow5: elements0,4,5,3,15 \u2192 [5,6,6,2,5]\n\nRow6: elements0,4,5,3,15 \u2192 [5,6,9,5,5]\n\nRow7: elements5,6,4,3,2 \u2192 [9,9,9,5,5]\n\nRow8: same as row7 \u2192 [9,9,9,5,5]\n\nRow9: elements0,4,5,3,15 \u2192 [5,6,9,5,5]\n\nThis would give the output as:\n\n[5,6,6,2,5]\n\n[5,6,9,5,5]\n\n[9,9,9,5,5]\n\n[9,9,9,5,5]\n\n[5,6,9,5,5]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, their outputs have varying structures. For instance, example0's third and fourth lines are [8,8,7,2,2], which might correspond to elements5,6,4,3,2. Applying this to the test input's row7 and8 gives [9,9,9,5,5], which could be plausible.\n\nThus, the final answer would be:\n\n[5,6,6,2,5]\n\n[5,6,9,5,5]\n\n[9,9,9,5,5]\n\n[9,9,9,5,5]\n\n[5,6,9,5,5]\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this answer.",
