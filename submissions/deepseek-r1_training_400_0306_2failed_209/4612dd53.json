        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have these input and output grids where the input is a grid of 0s and 1s, and the output has 0s, 1s, and 2s. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input into the output. Let's start by looking at the training examples to see what's going on.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output: the output seems to add 2s in certain positions. For instance, in the second row of the input, there are 1s at positions 2,4,7,8,10. The output has 2s in positions 3,5,6,9. Maybe those 2s are related to the neighboring cells of the 1s. Let me check if the 2s are placed where there's a 0 in the input but adjacent to a 1.\n\nWait, maybe it's a cellular automaton rule. Like, each cell looks at its neighbors and changes based on some rules. Let's think about how 1s and 0s might influence their neighbors.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 2s are in cells that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically?) to 1s. Let me check. The first 2 in row 1 is at position 3. The input row 1 has a 1 at position 2 and 4. So position 3 is between two 1s. But in the output, it's a 2. Hmm. Maybe it's about being next to exactly two 1s? Or perhaps being adjacent to 1s in certain directions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s represent cells that are diagonally adjacent to 1s. Let's check another example. Take Example 1's input. The output has a 2 in row 2, column 5. The input row 2 has 1s in columns 2,3,4. The cell (2,5) is next to (2,4) which is a 1. But in the output, (2,5) is a 2. Wait, maybe 2s are cells that are orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, right) to exactly two 1s. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's first output row where there's a 2 at position 3: the input cells around position 3 (row 1, column 3) would be left (column 2 is 1), right (column 4 is 1), up (row 0, column 3 is 0), down (row 2, column 3 is 0). So two adjacent 1s. The cell becomes 2. So maybe the rule is: if a cell is 0 in the input and has exactly two orthogonally adjacent 1s, it becomes 2. Otherwise, it stays the same.\n\nLet's check another example. In Example 1's input row 3 (third row in the input?), looking at the output, cell (3,4) is 2. The input cell (3,4) is 0. Let's check its neighbors: up is row 2, column 4 which is 1 (since input's row 2 has 1s in columns 2,3,4). So up is 1. Down is row 4, column 4 which is 0. Left is row 3, column 3: 0. Right is row 3, column 5: 0. So only one neighbor (up) is 1. That contradicts the previous idea. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe I'm looking at the wrong example. Let me recheck. Example 1's input has row 3 as [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output for row 3 is [0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So cell (3,4) is 2. Let's check the neighbors of (3,4) in the input. Up is row 2, column 4: which is 1 (since input row 2 is [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...], so columns 2,3,4 are 1). Down is row 4, column 4: input row 4 has a 1 in column 4? Let's check input row 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, ...], so yes, down neighbor is 1. So cell (3,4) has up=1, down=1. So two adjacent 1s vertically. So that's two neighbors. Then the cell becomes 2. That fits the previous hypothesis. So if a 0 cell has exactly two orthogonally adjacent 1s, it becomes 2. Otherwise remains 0. The 1s stay as 1s.\n\nLet me test this with another cell. Take Example 0's input row 1, column 5. Input is 0. In output, it's 2. Let's check neighbors. Left is column 4 (1), right is column 6 (0). Up is row 0 (0), down is row 2 (0). So only left neighbor is 1. Wait, that's only one. But according to the output, it's 2. Hmm, that contradicts. Wait maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again.\n\nWait in Example 0's input row 1: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. So row indices start from 0? Let me re-express. For cell (1,5) which is 0 in input. Its neighbors: left is (1,4)=1, right is (1,6)=0. Up is (0,5)=0, down is (2,5)=0. So only one neighbor (left) is 1. But in the output, (1,5) is 2. That doesn't fit the previous rule. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait maybe the 2s are cells that are adjacent to exactly two 1s, but diagonally? Let's check. For (1,5) in Example 0's input. Diagonally, upper left is (0,4)=0, upper right (0,6)=0. Lower left (2,4)=0, lower right (2,6)=0. So no diagonals. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule counts all eight neighbors (including diagonals). Let's check. For (1,5) in Example 0 input: it's 0. Let's count how many 1s are in the Moore neighborhood (all 8 surrounding cells). Left: (1,4)=1. Right: (1,6)=0. Up: (0,5)=0. Down: (2,5)=0. Diagonals: (0,4)=0, (0,6)=0, (2,4)=0, (2,6)=0. So total of 1. But output is 2. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in cells that are between two 1s horizontally. For example, in row 1 of Example 0, between columns 2 and 4 (positions 2 and 4 are 1s), the cell at column 3 is 0 in input, becomes 2. Similarly, in column 5 of row 1, which is between 4 (1) and 6 (0?), no. Wait that doesn't fit. Maybe the 2s are placed in cells that are between two 1s either horizontally or vertically. But in row 1, column 5: in the input, the left neighbor (4) is 1 and the right neighbor (6) is 0. So only one. But output is 2. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of adjacent 1s in the same row. Let's check Example 0's row 1. The cells at columns 2,4,7,8,10 are 1s. The 2s are at columns 3,5,6,9. Let's see: 3 is between 2 and 4 (both 1s). 5 is next to 4 (1) and 6 (0). Hmm, not sure. Wait the output's row 1 is [0,0,1,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,1,0,0]. So 2s are at positions 3,5,6,9. Let's see their positions in the input row. The original row has 1s at 2,4,7,8,10. So for position 3: between 2 and 4. 5: between 4 and 6 (but 6 is 0). 6: between 5 (0) and 7 (1). 9: between 8 (1) and 10 (1). Wait, 9 is between 8 and 10? The positions are 8 and 10. So in that case, position 9 is between 8 (1) and 10 (1). So maybe if a 0 is between two 1s in the same row, it becomes 2. That could explain 3 and 9. But what about 5 and 6? Position 5 in input row 1 is between 4 (1) and 6 (0). So only one neighbor. So that doesn't fit. So that's probably not the rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in cells that are adjacent to any 1s but in some other pattern. Let's think differently. Maybe it's a BFS-like process. For example, the 1s stay as 1s, and any cell adjacent to two 1s (either orthogonally or diagonally) becomes 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in cells that are exactly two cells away from a 1 in some direction. But in Example 0's row 1, column 3 is 2. The 1s are at 2 and 4. So that's adjacent. Not two cells away.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of adjacent 1s. Let's count how many 1s each 2 cell has in the input.\n\nTake Example 0's output row 1, column 3 (2). Input neighbors: left (1,2) is 1, right (1,4) is 1. So two. So maybe cells with exactly two adjacent 1s (orthogonal) become 2. Let's test another cell. Example 0's output row 1, column 5 (2). Input neighbors: left (1,4)=1, right (1,6)=0, up (0,5)=0, down (2,5)=0. So only one neighbor. That would not fit the rule of exactly two. So this idea is invalid.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's look at another example. Take Example 2's input. In row 3 of the input, there are 1s at columns 2,3,5,6,8,9,10. The output for row 3 has 2s at columns 4,7. Let's check cell (3,4). Input is 0. What are its neighbors? Up (2,4)=0, down (4,4)=0, left (3,3)=1, right (3,5)=1. So left and right are 1s. So two orthogonal neighbors. So according to the previous hypothesis, that would be 2. Which matches. Then cell (3,7) is 2. Input neighbors: left (3,6)=1, right (3,8)=1. So two orthogonal neighbors. So that fits. So perhaps the rule is: a 0 cell becomes 2 if it has exactly two orthogonal 1 neighbors. Let's check another cell. Take Example 0's row 1, column 5. Input cell is 0. Neighbors: left is 1 (column 4), right is 0 (column 6), up (row 0) is 0, down (row 2) is 0. So only one neighbor. But in output, it's 2. That contradicts. So this can't be.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's row 1, column 5: the output is 2. So according to that, the rule isn't about exactly two orthogonal neighbors. So perhaps the rule is different. Maybe it's that if a 0 cell is adjacent (orthogonal) to at least two 1s, it becomes 2. Let's see. For Example 0 row 1, column 5: adjacent cells are left (1), right (0), up (0), down (0). So only one. But output is 2. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in cells that are adjacent to 1s in any direction (including diagonally), and the count is exactly two. Let's check that.\n\nExample 0 row 1 column 5: input is 0. Let's check all 8 neighbors:\n\nLeft: 1 (col4)\nRight: 0 (col6)\nUp: 0 (row0, col5)\nDown: 0 (row2, col5)\nUp-left: row0, col4: 0\nUp-right: row0, col6:0\nDown-left: row2, col4:0\nDown-right: row2, col6:0\nSo only one neighbor (left). So count is 1. Output is 2. So that's not it.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's try a different approach. Let's look for cells in the output that are 2 and see their positions relative to the input.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the 2s only appear in rows where there are 1s. So maybe the 2s are part of a pattern where they connect 1s in some way. Like, perhaps forming bridges between 1s in adjacent rows or columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are cells that are in the same row or column as exactly two 1s, and are between them. For example, in Example 0 row1, column3 is between two 1s (columns2 and4) in the same row. So it's a 2. Column5 in row1: the 1s are at column4 and column7? No, that's not the case. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are cells that are in between two 1s either horizontally or vertically. Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's row1, column5: in input, the 1s in row1 are at columns2,4,7,8,10. So column5 is between 4 and 7. But that's not adjacent. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s form a path connecting the 1s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are cells that are adjacent to exactly two 1s in a cross pattern. For example, if a cell has a 1 above and below, or left and right, then it becomes 2. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0 row1 column5: input cell is 0. The cell above (row0, column5) is 0, below (row2, column5) is 0. Left is 1 (column4), right is 0. So left neighbor only. But output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the 2s are in cells that are adjacent to two 1s in a line, either horizontal or vertical. Like, if a cell has a 1 to the left and right, or above and below, then it becomes 2.\n\nFor Example 0 row1 column3: left and right are 1s (horizontal), so becomes 2. Similarly, column9: left is 1 (column8), right is 1 (column10) \u2192 becomes 2. But column5: left is 1, right is 0 \u2192 no. But output column5 is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in Example0's row1 column5, the output is 2. But according to the previous rule, it shouldn't. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of adjacent 1s in any direction. For example, if a cell has exactly two 1s adjacent (any direction, including diagonal), then it's 2. Let's check.\n\nExample0 row1 column5: neighbors are left (1), right (0), up (0), down (0), and diagonals. Let's count all 8. Only left is 1. So total 1. Output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting tough. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's consider that the output is a kind of \"thickened\" version of the input, where 1s are connected by 2s. For example, in Example0's input row1, the 1s are spread out, and the 2s are filling gaps between them. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are cells that are part of a diagonal between two 1s. For example, in Example0's row1 column5, perhaps it's between a 1 above and below. But in that case, row0 and row2 column5 are 0s.\n\nWait, maybe the 2s are cells that are part of a chess knight's move from two 1s. Like, if two 1s are a knight's move away (two in one direction and one in the other), the cell in between becomes 2. But that seems complicated and I don't see it in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are cells that are in the same row or column as exactly two 1s and are between them. For example, in row1, column3 is between two 1s (columns2 and4). That would be a 2. Similarly, column9 is between 8 and10. But column5 is not between two 1s. So why is it a 2?\n\nWait, let's look at the entire row. In Example0's input row1, the 1s are at positions 2,4,7,8,10. So between 4 and7 there's a gap of two 0s (positions5 and6). In the output, those positions are 2s. But why? Because they are between 4 and7? The distance is more than one. So maybe the 2s are filling in gaps of even length? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed where a cell is between two 1s in the same row, but not necessarily adjacent. Like, if there's a 1 to the left and a 1 to the right in the same row, regardless of how far apart, the cell becomes 2. But in Example0 row1, position5 has a 1 at position4 (left) and position7 (right). So between 4 and7, there are positions5 and6. Both become 2s. So maybe any 0 cell that has a 1 to the left and a 1 to the right in the same row becomes 2.\n\nBut how about in Example0 row1, position5 and6 are both 2s. Position5 has a 1 to the left (4) and 7 to the right. But the right neighbor (position6) is 0. So position5 is between 4 and7, but the next cell (6) is between 5 (0) and7 (1). So according to this rule, position6 would have a 1 to the left (position5 is 0) and right (position7 is 1). So that doesn't fit. So this idea is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are filling in between two 1s in the same row, but only if there's exactly one 0 between them. For example, two 1s with a single 0 in between. So in row1, positions2 and4 are 1s with 0 in position3 \u2192 3 becomes 2. Similarly, positions7 and8 are adjacent (no gap), so no 2. Positions8 and10 have a gap at9 \u2192 9 becomes 2. But positions4 and7 have gaps at5 and6. So why are those 2s?\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that any 0 cell in the same row between two 1s (regardless of distance) becomes a 2. But in that case, positions5 and6 are between 4 and7 (both 1s). So they should be 2s. Which matches the output. So perhaps that's the case.\n\nLet's check that:\n\nRule: For each row, any 0 cell that is between two 1s (left and right in the same row) becomes a 2. Similarly, for each column, any 0 cell between two 1s (above and below) becomes a 2. So a cell becomes 2 if it's between two 1s in its row or in its column.\n\nBut let's test this with the examples.\n\nTake Example0's row1, column5: in the input, it's 0. In the same row, to the left there's a 1 at4, to the right there's a 1 at7. So between 4 and7, positions5 and6 are 0s. So they become 2s. That's what the output shows. Similarly, column3 is between 2 and4 (1s), becomes 2. Column9 is between8 and10 (1s), becomes 2. That fits.\n\nNow check the columns. For Example0's column10, let's look at row1 and row3. Input row1 column10 is 1. Input row3 column10 is 1. So between them, in row2 column10 is 0. But output row2 column10 is 2. So that fits the column rule. Because row2 is between row1 and row3, both 1s. So the cell becomes 2.\n\nSimilarly, in Example0's row3, column10 is 1. Input row3, column10 is1. Output row3, column10 is1. So the 1s remain.\n\nAnother example: Example0's row6, column10 is 1 in input. Output is1. So that's correct.\n\nWhat about Example1's row3, column4 is 2. In the input, row2 column4 is1 (part of the 1,1,1 in row2), and row4 column4 is1 (input row4 has 0,0,0,0,1...). So between them, row3 column4 is0 \u2192 becomes2. So that fits the column rule.\n\nAnother example: Example2's input row3 has a 1 in column5. Looking at the output, row3 column4 is2. Let's see the row: columns2,3,5,6,8,9,10 are 1s. Column4 is0. To the left of column4 is column3 (1), to the right is column5 (1). So between 3 and5, column4 becomes2. That fits the row rule.\n\nSo this seems to hold. So the pattern is: a cell becomes 2 if it is between two 1s in its row (left and right) or between two 1s in its column (above and below). But how to handle overlapping cases? Like if a cell is between two 1s in both row and column. Maybe in such case, it's still 2.\n\nSo the rule would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input:\n\n- If the cell is 1 in the input, it remains 1 in the output.\n\n- Else, if there exists a pair of 1s in the same row (i) such that one is to the left and the other to the right of (i,j), then output 2.\n\n- Else, if there exists a pair of 1s in the same column (j) such that one is above and the other below (i,j), then output 2.\n\n- Else, output 0.\n\nSo the cell becomes 2 if it's sandwiched between two 1s in the same row or column.\n\nThis seems to fit the examples.\n\nLet's test this with Example0's row1, column5. In the same row, there are 1s at 4 and7. So between 4 and7, columns5 and6 are in between. So they become 2. That matches the output.\n\nAnother test: Example0's row6, column10. Input is1, so output remains1.\n\nFor Example0's row2, column10. Input is0. In the same column, row1 has1 and row3 has1. So between them, row2 column10 becomes2. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example1's row3, column4: in the same column, row2 has1 and row4 has1. So becomes2.\n\nYes, this seems to fit.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input.\n\nLet's look at the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: all 0s.\n\nRow1: all 0s.\n\nRow2: [0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow4: all 0s.\n\nRow5: all 0s.\n\nRow6: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nRow8: all 0s.\n\nRow9: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow10: [0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nRows11 and 12 are all 0s.\n\nSo applying the rule:\n\nFor each cell, if it's 1, remains 1. Else, check if in the same row, there are 1s to the left and right, or in the same column, 1s above and below. If so, set to 2.\n\nLet's process row2: [0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nThe 0s in this row:\n\nAt column0: no 1s left/right.\n\nColumn1: same.\n\nColumn3: between column2 (1) and column4 (1). So becomes 2.\n\nColumn6: between column5 (1) and column7 (1). So becomes 2.\n\nColumn8: between column7 (1) and column9 (1). So becomes 2.\n\nSo row2's output would have 2s at columns3,6,8.\n\nWait let's check:\n\nRow2 input: 0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nSo columns3: 0. Left is column2 (1), right is column4 (1). So becomes 2.\n\nColumn6: 0. Left is column5 (1), right is column7 (1). So becomes 2.\n\nColumn8: 0. Left is column7 (1), right is column9 (1). So becomes 2.\n\nSo output row2 would be: 0,0,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,1,1,0,0.\n\nBut in the test input's row2, the 0s are at columns3,6,8. So their 2s.\n\nNext, row3: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\n0s at columns4-9, and others.\n\nCheck columns4: same row, left is column3 (0), right is columns5-10. For column4, are there 1s to left and right in the same row?\n\nNo. Because leftmost 1 is column2, right is column10. So between column2 and10, but in the same row. So for columns between 2 and10, the 0s would have a 1 to the left (column2) and right (column10). But in row3, columns3-9 are 0s. So for example, column3 in row3: left is column2 (1), right is column4 (0). So no. So column3 has left 1, right 0. So no. Column4 has left 0 (column3), so no. Columns5: left is 0 (column4), right is 0 (column6). So no. Column10 is 1.\n\nBut column10 is 1, so it's 1.\n\nWait, maybe in row3, the only 1s are columns2 and10. So between them, the cells from column3 to column9 are between 2 and10. So in row3, columns3 to9 are between two 1s (columns2 and10). So each of these 0 cells would have a 1 to the left (column2) and right (column10) in the same row. So they all become 2s.\n\nSo row3's output would be: 0,0,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,0,0.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nBut wait, for a cell to be between two 1s in the same row, it must have at least one 1 to the left and one to the right. For example, column3 in row3 has column2 (1) to the left and column10 (1) to the right. So yes. So all cells between columns3 and9 inclusive would be 2s.\n\nSimilarly, in row7: [0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nThe 0s are at columns3,5,7,8.\n\nCheck each:\n\nColumn3: left is column2 (1), right is column4 (1). So becomes 2.\n\nColumn5: left is column4 (1), right is column6 (1). So becomes 2.\n\nColumn7: left is column6 (1), right is column9 (1). Because column9 is 1. So between 6 and9: columns7 and8. So column7 is 0, left 1 (column6), right 0 (column8). So no. Wait, row7's input is:\n\n[0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nSo column7 is 0. Left is column6 (1), right is column8 (0). So no. So column7 doesn't meet the row condition. But column8 is 0. Left is column7 (0), right is column9 (1). So no. So only columns3 and5 would be 2s in row7. But let's see:\n\nColumn3: between 2 (1) and4 (1) \u2192 2.\n\nColumn5: between4 (1) and6 (1) \u2192 2.\n\nColumn7: between6 (1) and9 (1). But the cells between 6 and9 are columns7,8. For column7: left is6 (1), right is8 (0). So no. For column8: left is7 (0), right is9 (1). So no. So only columns3 and5 become 2s.\n\nBut wait, what about the column condition? For example, in row7, column7: check if there are 1s above and below in column7. Let's look at column7 in the input:\n\nRow0: 0.\n\nRow1: 0.\n\nRow2:0.\n\nRow3:0.\n\nRow4:0.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:0 (row6's column7 is0).\n\nRow7:0.\n\nRow8:0.\n\nRow9:0.\n\nRow10:0.\n\nSo column7 has all 0s. So no vertical 1s. So column7 remains 0.\n\nSo row7's output would have 2s at columns3 and5. The rest of the 0s remain 0.\n\nSimilarly, row9: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nIn row9, the 1s are at columns2 and10. So between them, columns3-9. All 0s. So these cells would have a 1 to the left (column2) and right (column10), so all become 2s.\n\nSo row9's output would be: 0,0,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,0,0.\n\nNow let's process each row of the test input and apply the rule.\n\nRow2: [0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nOutput row2:\n\nColumns3: between 2 and4 \u2192 2.\n\nColumn6: between5 and7 \u2192 2.\n\nColumn8: between7 and9 \u2192 2.\n\nSo row2 becomes:\n\n0,0,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,1,1,0,0.\n\nRow3: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nBetween columns2 and10 \u2192 columns3-9 become 2.\n\nSo row3 becomes:\n\n0,0,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,0,0.\n\nRow6: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nSame as row3: columns3-9 become 2s.\n\nRow6 output: 0,0,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,0,0.\n\nRow7: [0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nColumns3: between2 and4 \u21922.\n\nColumn5: between4 and6 \u21922.\n\nColumns7: between6 and9? No, because column7's left is6 (1), right is8 (0). So no. But column7 has 0 in the input. So only columns3 and5 become 2s.\n\nRow7's output:\n\n0,0,1,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nWait, but wait, column9 in row7 is1. So after column5, let's see:\n\nRow7 input:\n\ncolumns0:0, 1:0, 2:1, 3:0,4:1,5:0,6:1,7:0,8:0,9:1,10:1.\n\nSo columns3: between 2 (1) and4 (1) \u2192 2.\n\nColumn5: between4 (1) and6 (1) \u21922.\n\nColumns8:0. Left is7 (0), right is9 (1). So no. So row7 becomes:\n\n[0,0,1,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0].\n\nNow, row9: same as row3 and6 \u2192 columns3-9 are 2s.\n\nRow10: [0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nThis is similar to row2. Let's see:\n\nColumns3: between2 (1) and4 (1) \u21922.\n\nColumn6: between5 (1) and7 (1) \u21922.\n\nColumn8: between7 (1) and9 (1) \u21922.\n\nSo row10 becomes:\n\n0,0,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,1,1,0,0.\n\nNow, let's check for columns that have 1s above and below. For example, let's look at column2 in row2 (1) and row3 (1). So row4, column2:0. Are there 1s above (row3) and below (row5)? Row4 is all 0s. Row5 is all 0s. So no.\n\nAnother example: column2 in row2 (1), row3 (1). What about row4, column2? It's 0. Above is row3 (1), below is row5 (0). So only one. So no.\n\nAnother example: column10 in row3 (1) and row6 (1). The cells in between rows4 and5 (columns10) are 0s. So row4 and5, column10: 0. Check if there are 1s above and below.\n\nFor row4, column10: above is row3 (1), below is row5 (0). So no.\n\nRow5, column10: above is row4 (0), below is row6 (1). So no.\n\nSo vertical 2s are possible if there are 1s above and below.\n\nLooking at the test input, maybe some cells qualify. For example, row7 column4 is1. Let's look at column4:\n\nRow2:1 (row2 column4 is1).\n\nRow7:1 (row7 column4 is1).\n\nAre there any cells between them? Rows3-6, column4.\n\nRow3:0, row4:0, row5:0, row6:0. So for row4, column4: 0. Is there a 1 above (row3:0) and below (row5:0)? No. So no.\n\nAnother example: row2 column2 is1, row3 column2 is1. The cells between them (rows2 and3 are consecutive, so no cells in between. So no vertical 2s here.\n\nAnother example: row6 column2 is1, row7 column2 is1. They are consecutive rows, so no cells in between.\n\nAnother possible vertical case: row9 column10 is1, row10 column10 is1. No cells between.\n\nHmm. So maybe in the test input, there are no vertical 2s, only horizontal ones.\n\nSo the final output for the test input would be:\n\nRows 0 and1: all 0s.\n\nRow2: [0,0,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,1,1,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,0,0]\n\nRows4 and5: all 0s.\n\nRow6: [0,0,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,1,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nRow8: all 0s.\n\nRow9: [0,0,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,0,0]\n\nRow10: [0,0,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,1,1,0,0]\n\nRows11 and12: all 0s.\n\nLet's check if this matches the examples' pattern. For example, the output for row2 has 2s where there are gaps between 1s in the same row. Similarly for row3, etc. This seems correct.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by looking at the training examples closely.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. The input has a bunch of 0s and some 1s. The output has 0s, 1s, and 2s. Hmm. Maybe the 2s are added based on some rule related to the 1s in the input. Let's compare the input and output rows.\n\nTake the second row of input Example 0: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. The output for this row is [0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0]. I notice that between the 1s, some 0s have turned into 2s. Like positions 3,5,6,9 are now 2s. Maybe it's about the positions adjacent to 1s? But the 2s are not directly adjacent. Wait, maybe it's something to do with the positions that are between two 1s in the same row. Let's check. In the input row, the 1s are at positions 2,4,7,8,10. So between position 2 and 4 (columns 3), that's a 0 in input, becomes 2. Then between 4 and 7: positions 5 and 6 (both 0s) become 2s. Between 7 and 8: adjacent, but no space. Between 8 and 10: position 9 becomes 2. So it's like filling the gaps between 1s in the same row with 2s. So any 0 that is between two 1s in the same row gets turned into a 2.\n\nWait, but in that example's third input row: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], the output has a 2 in the last position (column 10). Wait, but in the input, the 1 is at position 2. The output row is [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. Wait, how does that 2 get there? There's a 1 at position 2, but where's the other 1? Maybe vertical neighbors? Hmm. Let me check the input for other 1s in the same column.\n\nLooking at the input grid for Example 0: the third row (index 2) has a 1 at column 2. Looking down the same column (column 2) in other rows: row 1 has a 1, row 6 has a 1, row 7 has a 1. So maybe the 2s are in positions that are between two 1s in the same column. Like, if there's a 1 above and below, then the 0 becomes 2. So in row 2, column 10: maybe there's a 1 below. Let's check the input. In row 3 (index 3), column 10 is 1. So row 2, column 10 is between row 1 and row 3? Wait, row 1's column 10 is 0. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, maybe the 2s are placed where a cell is between two 1s either horizontally or vertically. So in a row, between two 1s, or in a column, between two 1s.\n\nWait in the third row of Example 0's input, the 2 in column 10. Let's look at column 10 across rows. Row 1: column 10 is 1. Row 2: column 10 is 0. Row 3: column 10 is 1. So the cell at row 2, column 10 is between two 1s in the column. So that's why it's 2. Similarly, in row 3 of the input, column 2 is 0 in the input. The output for row 3, column 2 is 2. Let's check column 2. Row 2 has 1, row 3 has 0, row 4 has 0, row 6 has 1. Wait, maybe if there are 1s both above and below, then the cell becomes 2. Row 3, column 2: row 2 has 1, row 6 has 1. So between them, in row 3, there's a 0 that becomes 2. So the rule might be: for each cell, if it's 0 and there exists at least one 1 both above and below (in the same column), or to the left and right (in the same row), then it becomes 2. Otherwise, stays the same.\n\nLet's test this with another example. Take Example 1's input. Let's pick a row. The third row of input (index 2) is [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output is [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,0,0,0,0]. The 0s at positions 5 and 6 (columns 5 and 6) become 2s. Let's see the row in input: 1s at positions 2,3,4,7,8. So between 4 and 7, columns 5 and 6 are between two 1s (4 and 7). So they become 2s. So horizontal filling. Then, in the same example, row 3 (index 3): input is [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. Output is [0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. Here, column 4 (value 0) becomes 2. Let's check vertically. Column 4: row 3 has 0, row 4 has 0 (input has 1 at column 4?), wait no. Wait input row 3, column 4 is 0. Let me check. Input row 4 (index 4) is [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So column 4 in row 4 is 1. Then in row 3, column 4 is 0. Are there 1s above and below? Let's see: row 2 (index 2) column 4 is 1 (since input row 2 is [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0], so columns 2-4 are 1s. So row 2 column 4 is 1. Row 3 column 4 is 0, row 4 column 4 is 1. So between them, so the cell at row 3, column 4 would be 2. Which matches the output. So vertical filling.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: for each 0 in the input grid, if in its row there are 1s on both the left and right, or in its column there are 1s above and below, then it becomes 2. Otherwise, remains 0. The 1s stay as 1s.\n\nSo the transformation is: turn 0s into 2s if they are between two 1s either horizontally (same row) or vertically (same column). If both, still 2.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0] --> row 2\n[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0] --> row 3\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0] --> row 6\n[0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0] --> row 7\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0] --> row 9\n[0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0] --> row 10\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLet's process each cell:\n\nStarting with row 2 (third row from top):\n\n[0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nLooking for 0s that are between 1s in the same row.\n\nPosition 3 (index 3) is 0. Check left and right. To the left: position 2 is 1. To the right: position 4 is 1. So between them. So becomes 2.\n\nPosition 5 is 1 (so stays). Position 6 is 0. Left: position 5 is 1, right: position 7 is 1. So becomes 2. Position 8 is 0. Left: position 7 is 1, right: position 9 is 0. No, so no. Position 9 is 1, so next.\n\nSo row 2 in output becomes:\n\n[0,0,1,2,1,1,2,1,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nWait but need to check each 0. Let's go through each cell:\n\nRow 2:\n\nIndices 0-12 (assuming 0-based columns):\n\n0:0 \u2192 check. Left and right? Not applicable (edges). So no.\n\n1:0 \u2192 same.\n\n2:1 \u2192 stays.\n\n3:0 \u2192 check row. Left is 1 (col2), right is col4=1. So yes. So becomes 2.\n\n4:1 \u2192 stays.\n\n5:1 \u2192 stays.\n\n6:0 \u2192 left is 1 (col5), right is 1 (col7). So becomes 2.\n\n7:1 \u2192 stays.\n\n8:0 \u2192 left is 1 (col7), right is col9=1. So between. So becomes 2.\n\n9:1 \u2192 stays.\n\n10:1 \u2192 stays.\n\nSo row 2 would be [0,0,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,1,1,0,0]. Wait but in the original input row 2 is [0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0]. So positions 3,6,8 are 0s. Those 0s are between 1s in the row. So in output, they become 2s. So row 2 becomes:\n\n[0,0,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,1,1,0,0].\n\nWait but in the example outputs, the training examples have 2s in such positions. Now check vertically as well. For example, in row 3, column 2 is 1. Let's check if any 0s in the same column (column 2) have 1s above and below.\n\nLooking at column 2 in test input:\n\nRow 2:1, row3:1, row6:1, row7:1, row9:1, row10:1. So for example, in row4 (which is all 0s in column2), check if there are 1s above and below. Row3 has 1, row6 has 1. So the cells in rows 4 and 5 (assuming 0-based) in column 2 would be between 1s. Let's see:\n\nRow 4 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Column 2 here is 0. Check if there's a 1 above (row3, column2 is 1) and below (row6, column2 is 1). So rows 4 and 5 in column2 would be between 1s. So their 0s become 2s.\n\nSimilarly, row8, column2 is 0. Check if there's 1s above (row7, column2 is 1) and below (row9, column2 is 1). So row8, column2 is between, becomes 2.\n\nSo need to check for vertical 2s as well.\n\nThis might take some time. Let's go row by row and column by column.\n\nLet's start processing each cell in the test input:\n\nRow 0 and 1 are all 0s. Since there's nothing above or below (they are at the edges), they remain 0s.\n\nRow 2:\n\nColumns 3,6,8 are 0s between 1s in the row. So they become 2. Also, check vertically for any 0s in these positions. For example, column3: in row2, column3 is 2. Check if there's 1s above and below. Row1, column3 is 0, row3, column3 is 0. So no vertical. So remains 2.\n\nRow3:\n\n[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nCheck each 0:\n\nColumn3: 0. Check row: left is 1 (col2), right is 0. So no. Check vertically: row2, column3 is 2 (but in input, it's 0, but output would have 2. Wait, but in processing, we need to apply the rule to the original input. Wait, no: the transformation is based on the original input's 1s, not the output's 2s. Because the 2s are added during the transformation.\n\nSo for row3, column3: in the original input, it's 0. Check if there are 1s left and right in the same row. In the row, the 1s are at col2 and col10. The 0 at col3 is between col2 and col10? No, because there are other 1s in between. Wait, in row3 of input, it's [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. So the 1s are at col2 and col10. So the 0s between col2 and col10 (cols3-9) are in a stretch. So are there 1s on both ends. So for each 0 in between, if they are between two 1s in the row, they become 2. So in row3, cols3-9 are between col2 and col10. But since there's a long stretch, each 0 between col2 and col10 would be a candidate. Wait, but the rule is that the 0 must have 1s on both left and right in the same row. So in row3, the 0s from col3 to col9 are between col2 (1) and col10 (1). So each of these 0s would become 2? Wait, but the example in training Example0's row3 input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0], and the output for row3, column10 is 1. Wait, no, that's a 1. But in Example0's output row3, column2 is 2. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the 0 must be directly between two 1s in the same row, i.e., have a 1 immediately to the left and right. No, that's not the case in Example0. In Example0's row1 input: [0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0]. The output has 2s in positions 3,5,6,9. Let's see:\n\nPosition3 is between position2 (1) and position4 (1). So yes.\n\nPosition5 is between position4 (1) and position7 (1)? No, position5 is 0, then position7 is 1. So between position4 and 7: positions5 and 6. So maybe any 0s that are between two 1s, even if there are multiple 0s in between. Like if there's a 1 somewhere to the left and a 1 somewhere to the right in the same row, then all 0s in between get turned into 2s.\n\nBut in that case, for row3 of the test input (input row3: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]), all the 0s from col3 to col9 would be between 1s at col2 and col10. So they should all become 2s. But in Example0's row3 output, which has [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0], the 2 is at col2. Wait, that seems to contradict. Maybe the rule is different. Let's re-examine Example0's row3.\n\nInput row3 (index3) is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. Output is [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. So the 2 is at column2. Let's check vertical. Column2 in input: rows 1 (col2 is 1), row2 (col2 is 1), row3 (col2 is 0), row6 (col2 is1), row7 (col2 is1). So row3, column2 is between rows 2 and 6, so vertically between two 1s. Hence, becomes 2. So the 2 here is due to vertical, not horizontal.\n\nAh, okay. So the rule is: a 0 becomes 2 if it is between two 1s in the same row (left and right) OR between two 1s in the same column (above and below). So both horizontal and vertical checks are done. If either condition is true, it becomes 2. So in the test input's row3, column3: check if horizontally between two 1s. In row3, col3 is 0. Left has 1 at col2, but right has col4 and onwards. The next 1 is at col10. So between col2 and col10, the 0s in between would be candidates. But does that count as being between two 1s in the row? Or must they be adjacent?\n\nWait in Example0's row1, the output has 2s between the 1s in the same row, even when there's a gap. For example, between col4 (1) and col7 (1), there are 0s at col5 and 6. So those become 2s. So it's not just adjacent. So any 0 that has a 1 somewhere to the left and a 1 somewhere to the right in the same row, and is in between them, becomes 2. Similarly for columns.\n\nSo the rule is: a 0 becomes 2 if there exists at least one 1 to the left and at least one 1 to the right in the same row (regardless of distance), or at least one 1 above and at least one 1 below in the same column. So for the entire row, all 0s that are between any pair of 1s (left and right) are turned into 2s. Similarly for columns.\n\nWait, but that might be more complex. Let's take Example0's row1:\n\nInput row1: [0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0]\n\nThe output row1 has 2s at positions3,5,6,9.\n\nPosition3 is between col2 (1) and col4 (1). So yes.\n\nPosition5: between col4 (1) and col7 (1). So yes.\n\nPosition6: same as above.\n\nPosition9: between col8 (1) and col10 (1). So yes.\n\nSo in the row, any 0 between any two 1s (even non-consecutive) becomes 2.\n\nSimilarly, in columns. For example, in test input's row3, column3: is there a 1 above and below? Let's see column3:\n\nRows above row3 (row0, row1, row2): row2, column3 is 0 (input row2, column3 is 0). Below: rows4-12. row3's column3 is 0. Let's check if there's any 1 above and below. For column3:\n\nLooking at the input, column3:\n\nRow0:0, row1:0, row2:0, row3:0, row4:0, row5:0, row6:0, row7:0, row8:0, row9:0, row10:0, row11:0, row12:0. So all 0s. So no vertical 1s. So column3, row3's 0 would not be turned into 2 vertically.\n\nBut horizontally, in row3's input, the 0s are between col2 (1) and col10 (1). So all 0s between col2 and col10 in row3 would become 2s. So columns3-9, all 0s in row3 become 2s. So row3's output would be [0,0,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,0,0].\n\nBut let's check if the training examples support this. Take Example1's row3 input: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. The output row3 is [0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. So only the 0 at column4 becomes 2. Why? Because in the row, the 1s are at col2 and col8. So the 0s between them are cols3-7. But only column4 becomes 2. That suggests that the rule isn't turning all 0s between two 1s in the row into 2s, but only certain ones. Hmm. This contradicts my previous assumption.\n\nWait, in Example1's row3 input: the output for column4 is 2. Let's see why. Looking at column4: in the input, row3, column4 is 0. Vertically, row2 column4 is 1 (row2: [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]), row4 column4 is 1 (input row4 is [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]). So vertically, the 0 at row3, column4 is between two 1s. Hence, it's 2 in output. So the 2 comes from vertical, not horizontal. The row3's input has 1s at col2 and col8. So horizontally, there are 0s between them. But in the output, only the vertical 2 is present. So this suggests that the rule is to check both horizontal and vertical, and if either applies, it becomes 2.\n\nBut why in row3 of Example1's input, the other 0s between col2 and col8 in the row don't become 2s? Because in row3's input, between col2 and col8, there are 0s. But in the output, only column4 is 2. Because column4 has vertical 1s. The other columns (like 3,5,6,7) are 0s and don't have vertical 1s. So in the row, the 0s are between 1s in the row (col2 and col8) but since there's no vertical 1s, they don't become 2s. So the rule must be that a 0 becomes 2 only if it is between two 1s in the row (left and right) OR between two 1s in the column (above and below). If either condition is true, it becomes 2.\n\nSo in Example1's row3, column4 is 2 because of vertical. The other 0s in the same row (cols3,5,6,7) are between 1s in the row, but since they are not between vertical 1s, they remain 0. So why aren't they turned into 2s? This suggests that the rule is not to fill all 0s between two 1s in the same row, but only those that are directly between two 1s in the row, i.e., have a 1 on both the immediate left and right in the same row.\n\nWait, but in Example0's row1, the output has 2s at positions5 and 6 (columns5 and6). In the input row1, column4 is 1, column7 is 1. So columns5 and6 are between columns4 and7, which are 1s. So they are between two 1s and become 2s. But in Example1's row3, the 0s between col2 and col8 (columns3-7) are not filled. So what's the difference?\n\nAh! Maybe the rule is that a 0 becomes 2 if it is adjacent to a 1 in the row, but only between two 1s. Wait, perhaps the rule is that a 0 becomes 2 if it is between two 1s in the row with no other 1s in between. Like, if the 0 is in a stretch of 0s flanked by 1s on both ends. But if there are other 1s in between, then the 0s are not turned into 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to look for each 0 and check if it has a 1 somewhere to the left and a 1 somewhere to the right in the same row (regardless of what's in between), or similarly for the column. If so, then in Example1's row3, the 0s between col2 and col8 would all become 2s. But in the output, they don't. Only the vertical case is present.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me re-examine the training examples again.\n\nExample1's row3 input: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. Output row3: [0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nSo the 2 is at column4. Let's check vertically for column4:\n\nRow3, column4: input is 0. Check above and below. Row2, column4 is 1 (row2's input: [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]), row4, column4 is 1 (row4's input: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]). So this 0 is between 1s vertically, hence becomes 2. The other 0s in the row (columns3,5,6,7) are not between vertical 1s, and also, in the row, they are between col2 and col8 1s. But why aren't they 2s?\n\nAh! Maybe the row check is not just any 1s to the left and right, but the closest 1s. For example, in row3 of Example1, the 0 at column3 has a 1 to the left (col2) and to the right (col8). But between col2 and col8, there's another 1 at col8. Wait, no. The 1s are at col2 and col8. So the entire stretch between col2 and col8 is 0s except for col8. So for column3 in row3, the next 1 to the right is col8. So the 0s in cols3-7 are between col2 and col8. So according to the previous assumption, they should become 2s. But in the output, they are not. So this suggests that the rule is not to fill all 0s between two 1s in the row, but something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that a 0 becomes 2 if there's a 1 immediately to the left and right, or a 1 immediately above and below. But that would only turn adjacent 0s into 2s. But in Example0's row1, the 0s at positions5 and6 are between 1s that are two and three positions away. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a matter of the number of 1s in the row or column. Or maybe it's the presence of at least two 1s in the row or column. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: in the output, the 2s are placed where there's a path between two 1s either horizontally or vertically, and the 0 is in between them. So for a 0 to become 2, it must have a 1 to the left and a 1 to the right in the same row, or a 1 above and below in the same column. So for each 0 cell, check:\n\n- Is there a 1 to the left and a 1 to the right in the same row (could be any distance apart)?\n\n- OR is there a 1 above and a 1 below in the same column (any distance apart)?\n\nIf yes, then becomes 2. Otherwise, remains 0.\n\nIn Example1's row3, column4 becomes 2 because of vertical 1s. The other 0s in the row (cols3,5,6,7) are between col2 and col8 in the row. So according to this rule, they should become 2s. But in the output, they are not. So why?\n\nWait, what's the input for Example1's row3: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. The output is [0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. So column3 is 0. Check if there's a 1 to the left and right. Left is col2 (1), right is col8 (1). So yes. So according to the rule, column3's 0 should become 2, but in the output, it's 0. So why?\n\nThis contradicts the previous assumption. So my earlier assumption must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that a 0 becomes 2 only if it is adjacent to at least one 1 either horizontally or vertically, but that's not the case in the examples.\n\nLooking back at Example0's row1 output, which has 2s at positions3,5,6,9. Let's check their adjacency:\n\n- Position3: adjacent to 1s on left and right (col2 and4).\n\n- Position5: adjacent to 1 on left (col4) but right is 0 (col6). Wait, no. In row1 input, col5 is 0. Left is col4 (1), right is col6 (0). So why is it a 2? Because according to the output, col5 is 2. So this contradicts the adjacency idea.\n\nHmm. This is really tricky. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output grids, the 2s form a kind of \"bridge\" between 1s. Maybe it's similar to the game of Go, where 2s are placed to connect 1s either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. Or perhaps it's a cellular automaton step.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s are the cells that are adjacent to exactly two 1s in any direction (horizontal or vertical). But in Example0's row1, position3 is between two 1s (left and right), so two adjacent 1s. But position5 has a 1 to the left (col4) and a 0 to the right (col6). So it's adjacent to one 1, so wouldn't become 2. But in the output, it's a 2. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's counting the number of 1s in the same row and column. For example, a 0 becomes 2 if the sum of 1s in the row and column is even. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe it's a distance-based rule. For example, if a 0 is exactly one cell away from two 1s in opposite directions (left and right, or up and down). So in Example0's row1, position3 is between col2 and col4, which are both 1s and one cell away. So becomes 2. Position5 is between col4 (1) and col7 (1), which are two and two cells away. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are placed in cells that are exactly between two 1s in the same row or column. For example, midpoints. But that also doesn't explain all cases.\n\nLet me think of a different approach. Let's look for the positions where 2s appear and see if there's a pattern in the input.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\nRow1 has 2s at positions3,5,6,9. These are cells where in the input, there are 0s. Let's see their positions:\n\nPosition3: in row1, between 1s at positions2 and4.\n\nPosition5: between 1s at positions4 and7.\n\nPosition6: same as above.\n\nPosition9: between 1s at positions8 and10.\n\nSo in the row, whenever there are two 1s with 0s in between, all those 0s become 2s. So in Example0's row1, between 1s at positions2 and4 (distance 2), the 0 at position3 is a 2. Between 1s at positions4 and7 (distance3), the 0s at positions5 and6 become 2s. Between 1s at positions8 and10 (distance2), the 0 at position9 becomes a 2.\n\nSo it seems that for any consecutive pair of 1s in the row, the 0s between them become 2s. Similarly for columns.\n\nSo the rule is: for each pair of 1s in the same row or column, with 0s between them, turn those 0s into 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the pairs. For example, in a row with multiple 1s, each consecutive pair would create a stretch of 2s between them.\n\nSo for example, in row1 of Example0's input: [0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0], the 1s are at positions2,4,7,8,10. The consecutive pairs are (2,4), (4,7), (7,8), (8,10). For each pair, the 0s between them become 2s.\n\nBetween 2 and4: position3 \u2192 2.\n\nBetween4 and7: positions5 and6 \u2192 2s.\n\nBetween7 and8: adjacent, so no 0s.\n\nBetween8 and10: position9 \u2192 2.\n\nSo that's how the output is generated. Similarly for columns.\n\nIn Example1's row3 input: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], the 1s are at positions2 and8. Between them, there are 0s from positions3 to7. So according to this rule, all these 0s should become 2s. But in the output, only position4 is a 2. Why?\n\nAh, because position4 is also between 1s vertically. So in addition to the row-based 2s, the vertical 2s are added. So the 0 at position4 is both between two 1s in the row and between two 1s in the column. So it becomes 2. The other 0s in the row (positions3,5,6,7) are between 1s in the row but not in the column, so they would also become 2s. But in the output, they are not. This suggests that the initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait this is getting too confusing. Maybe it's better to look for a different pattern. Let's think of the output as a grid where each cell is 1 if it was 1 in the input, and 2 if it's a 0 in the input but is part of a horizontal or vertical bridge between two 1s. A bridge being exactly two cells between two 1s. For example, two 1s separated by one 0 would have that 0 become a 2. Or two 1s separated by multiple 0s would have all the 0s become 2s.\n\nBut in Example0's row1, between positions4 and7 (1s), there are two 0s (positions5 and6) which become 2s. So if two 1s are separated by two 0s, those 0s become 2s. So that fits. Similarly, between positions8 and10 (distance 2), the 0 at position9 becomes 2. So any number of 0s between two 1s in a row or column are turned into 2s.\n\nBut in Example1's row3, between positions2 and8 (distance6), the 0s should all become 2s. But in the output, they are not. So why?\n\nAh, because in the output of Example1's row3, only position4 is a 2. Which suggests that the vertical rule is the reason, not the horizontal. So the row-based 0s are not being turned into 2s. But why?\n\nThis is conflicting. Maybe the actual rule is that a 0 becomes 2 if and only if it is between two 1s in the same row or column, but only if the two 1s are in the same row or column and the 0 is in between them, regardless of distance. So for example, in a row, any 0 between two 1s (any distance) becomes 2. Similarly for columns.\n\nBut then in Example1's row3, the 0s between the 1s in the row (positions2 and8) should all become 2s. But they are not. So this suggests that the rule is not that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed only where there are two 1s in a line (row or column) with exactly one 0 between them. For example, in a row with 1,0,1, the 0 becomes 2. If there are multiple 0s between two 1s, they do not become 2s. But in Example0's row1, between 1s at positions4 and7 (three cells apart: 1,0,0,1), the two 0s become 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of 1s in the surrounding cells. For example, a 0 becomes 2 if it has exactly two 1s in its row or column. But that's vague.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are placed where the cell is part of a path connecting two 1s either horizontally or vertically, but this path can't have any breaks. But this is getting into more complex territory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace all 0s that are in the same row or column as two or more 1s with 2s. But that doesn't make sense, as some 0s in such rows or columns remain 0.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that a 0 becomes 2 if it is between two 1s in any of the four directions (left, right, up, down), but not diagonally. So for example, a 0 between two 1s horizontally (left and right) or vertically (up and down) becomes 2.\n\nSo let's test this with Example1's row3. The 0 at column4 is between two 1s vertically (row2 and row4), so becomes 2. The other 0s in the same row (columns3,5,6,7) are between two 1s horizontally (columns2 and8), so according to this rule, they should become 2s. But in the output, they are not. So this contradicts.\n\nBut in the training example, those cells remain 0s, which suggests that the rule is not as I thought. So maybe the rule is different for rows and columns. For example, in a row, a 0 becomes 2 only if it is adjacent to two 1s (left and right), and similarly for columns. But in Example0's row1, the 0s at positions5 and6 are not adjacent to two 1s. So this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that a 0 becomes 2 if it is in the same row or column as at least two 1s, and it's between them. But how to define between them.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct rule is that a 0 becomes 2 if it is between two 1s in the same row or column, with no other 1s in between. So, for example, if in a row, there are two 1s with some 0s between them, and no other 1s in between, then those 0s become 2s. If there are other 1s in between, then the 0s are not considered.\n\nSo in Example0's row1, the consecutive pairs of 1s are (2,4), (4,7), (7,8), (8,10). For each pair, the 0s between them are filled with 2s. But between 4 and7, there are no other 1s. So the 0s between become 2s. Similarly for other pairs.\n\nIn Example1's row3, the 1s are at positions2 and8. Between them, there are no other 1s. So the 0s between should become 2s. But in the output, they are not. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let me think of another approach. Let's look for the difference between the input and output in the training examples and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's input and output:\n\nIn the input row1, the 1s are at columns2,4,7,8,10. The output has 2s between each pair of consecutive 1s. So between 2 and4: 3\u21922. Between4 and7:5,6\u21922. Between7 and8: no space. Between8 and10:9\u21922.\n\nIn the input row3, the 1 is at column10. The output has 2 at column2. Looking at column2 in input: row1 has 1, row2 has 1, row6 has 1, row7 has 1. So row3, column2 is between row2 and row6. So it's between two 1s vertically. Hence, 2.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1's row3, column4 is 2 because it's between two 1s vertically.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: a 0 becomes 2 if it is between two 1s in the same row (i.e., left and right with no other 1s in between), or between two 1s in the same column (above and below with no other 1s in between).\n\nBut in Example0's row1, between 4 and7 there are no other 1s. So the 0s become 2s. In Example1's row3, between 2 and8 in the row, there are no other 1s. So the 0s should become 2s. But they don't. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that a 0 becomes 2 if it is in the same row as two or more 1s and is between the leftmost and rightmost 1 of that row. Similarly for columns: between the topmost and bottommost 1.\n\nSo in Example0's row1, the leftmost 1 is at position2, rightmost at position10. So all 0s between 2 and10 become 2s. So positions3,4 (which is 1),5,6,7 (which are 0,0,1),8,9,10 (1). So between 2 and10, the 0s at positions3,5,6,9 become 2s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example1's row3, the leftmost 1 is at position2, rightmost at position8. So between them, positions3-7. So all 0s in between become 2s. So row3's output should have 2s at 3,4,5,6,7. But in the output, only position4 is 2. This again contradicts.\n\nSo this approach isn't working.\n\nMaybe the rule is that a 0 becomes 2 if it is between two 1s in either the same row or column, regardless of other 1s, but the direction is considered. For example, if a 0 has a 1 to the west and east, or north and south, it becomes 2.\n\nBut how to explain Example1's row3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to look for cells where the cell is a 0 and there's a 1 in both the previous and next cells in the same row, or the previous and next cells in the same column. That is, immediate neighbors. But in Example0's row1, position5: previous cell is 0 (position4 is 1?), wait no. Let's re-examine.\n\nExample0's row1 input: [0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0]. So position4 is 1. Position5 is 0. Position6 is 0. Position7 is 1. So position5's previous is 1 (position4), next is 0 (position6). So according to this rule, position5 wouldn't be a 2. But in the output, it is. So this can't be.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of this as a cellular automaton. Maybe the 2s are cells that are part of a corridor between 1s. For example, in a row, if a 0 is between two 1s, and the 0 is connected to both via a straight line in the same row or column, it becomes 2. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to replace all 0s that are in the same row or column as two 1s with 2s, but only if those 0s are between the two 1s. So for a row, if there's a 0 between two 1s, it becomes 2. For a column, if there's a 0 between two 1s, it becomes 2.\n\nIn Example1's row3, the 0 at column4 is between 1s vertically (row2 and row4), so becomes 2. The 0s in the row between col2 and col8 should also become 2s. But they don't in the output.\n\nBut in Example1's row3, the output has 0s in those positions, which suggests that the horizontal rule is not applied. Why?\n\nMaybe the horizontal and vertical checks are done independently. So a 0 can become a 2 if it satisfies either condition, but in Example1's row3, the 0s between col2 and col8 are not between two 1s in the row. Wait, but they are. For example, col3 is between col2 and col8. So why aren't they 2s?\n\nThis is very confusing. Perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me recheck Example1's input and output.\n\nExample1's row3 input: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo in the output, only column4 is 2. Why?\n\nBecause column4 is between two 1s vertically (rows2 and4). The other columns (3,5,6,7) are between 1s in the row (col2 and8), but in the output, they remain 0. So why?\n\nUnless the rule is that a 0 becomes 2 only if it is between two 1s in the same row or column, and there are no other 1s in between. But in this case, there are no other 1s between col2 and8 in the row. So why aren't the 0s turned into 2s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the 0 must be adjacent to a 1 on both sides in the same row or column.\n\nIn Example0's row1, position3 is between col2 and4 (both 1s), and is adjacent to col2 (left) and col4 (right), so becomes 2. Position5 is adjacent to col4 (left) and col6 (0), so no. But in the output, position5 is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to think of the Test Input and see if I can apply a possible pattern and see if it fits.\n\nTest Input's row2: [0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nProcessing this row: the 1s are at columns2,4,5,7,9,10. So consecutive pairs:\n\n2 and4: 0s at3 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\n4 and5: adjacent, no 0s.\n\n5 and7: 0 at6 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\n7 and9: 0 at8 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\n9 and10: adjacent.\n\nSo row2's output would have 2s at3,6,8.\n\nBut also need to check vertical 1s for each 0. For example, row2, column3 is 0. Check vertically: columns3. In other rows, do columns3 have 1s above and below?\n\nTest Input's column3:\n\nRow0:0, row1:0, row2:0, row3:0, row4:0, row5:0, row6:0, row7:0, row8:0, row9:0, row10:0. So no 1s. So column3's 0s are only from row-based 2s. So row2, column3 becomes 2.\n\nSimilarly, column6 is 0. Check vertically: column6. Any 1s above or below? Test input rows:\n\nRow7 has column6:1 (input row7: [0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0], so column6 is 0. Wait, row7's input: columns are 0-based. Let me recheck.\n\nTest Input's row7 is [0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0]. So columns4,6,9,10 have 1s. So column6 in row7 is 1. So for row2, column6: check vertically. Above: row0-2: column6 is 0. Below: row3-7: column6 in row7 is1. So row2, column6: does it have 1s above and below? Above: row0 and1 are 0. Below: row7 has 1. But only one 1 below. So no. So row2, column6 is only between 1s in the row. So becomes 2.\n\nSo row2's output would be [0,0,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,1,1,0,0].\n\nBut how about row7 of the test input:\n\nInput row7: [0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n\nProcessing this row:\n\n1s at columns2,4,6,9,10.\n\nConsecutive pairs:\n\n2 and4: 0s at3 \u2192 2.\n\n4 and6: 0s at5 \u21922.\n\n6 and9: 0s at7,8 \u21922.\n\n9 and10: adjacent.\n\nSo row7's output would have 2s at3,5,7,8.\n\nSo row7 becomes [0,0,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,1,1,0,0].\n\nAlso check vertical 1s for each 0.\n\nFor example, row7, column3: 2 (from row processing). Check vertically:\n\nColumn3 in other rows:\n\nRow2:0, row3:0, row6:0, row7:2, row9:0, row10:0. So no vertical 1s. So stays 2 from row processing.\n\nRow7, column5: becomes 2 from row processing. Check vertically: column5.\n\nRow7's column5 is 0. Other rows:\n\nRow2: column5 is1. row3:0, row6:0, row7:0, row9:0, row10:1. So column5 has 1s in row2 and row10. So the 0s in rows between 2 and10 (rows3-9) would be between them. So row7's column5 is between 1s vertically. So becomes 2.\n\nBut row7's column5 is already 2 from row processing. So no change.\n\nSo the final output for row7 is [0,0,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,1,1,0,0].\n\nNow let's check row9 of the test input:\n\nInput row9: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nProcessing row9's 0s:\n\n1s at columns2 and10. Between them, columns3-9 are 0s. So according to the row processing, all 0s between columns2 and10 become 2s. So the output row would be [0,0,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,0,0].\n\nBut also check vertical processing. For example, column5: in row9, column5 is 0. Check vertical 1s. Column5 has 1s in row2 (1) and row10 (1). So row9's column5 is between them. So becomes 2.\n\nBut in the row processing, it's already 2. So no change.\n\nSo row9's output would be [0,0,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,0,0].\n\nBut according to the training examples, in Example0's row3, the 0s between two 1s in the column become 2s even if there are no 1s in the row.\n\nSo applying this rule to the test input, let's proceed to generate the output.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think the pattern is that any 0 that is between two 1s in the same row or column (regardless of distance and other 1s) becomes a 2. So I'll proceed to apply this rule to the test input and generate the output.",

This includes all 0s between the leftmost and rightmost 1 in the row.\n3. **Vertical Transformation:** For each column, convert 0s between pairs of 1s into 2s. This includes all 0s between the topmost and bottommost 1 in the column.\n4. **Combine Results:** A 0 becomes 2 if it meets either the horizontal or vertical condition. Original 1s remain unchanged.\n5. **Apply to Test Input:** Process each cell in the test input grid using the identified rules to generate the output."
