        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each example has a list of input arrays and an output array. The output seems to be a list of numbers. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0, the input consists of multiple arrays. The output is [1,8] and [6,1]. Looking at the input arrays, I notice that the first part of the input arrays (before the 0s maybe?) have numbers 1 and 8. Then, after some zeros, there are 6s and 1s. The output pairs are [first number group, second number group]. Like the first part has 1s and 8s, so the first output is [1,8], then the next group has 6s and 1s, so [6,1]. So maybe the output is taking the two dominant numbers from each segment of the input arrays, ordered by their appearance?\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output is [4,8,3] and [1,2,8]. The input arrays start with 4s, then 8s, then 3s, followed by 1s, 2s, and 8s. The outputs are the distinct numbers in order of their appearance, but grouped. Wait, each input array is split into sections separated by zeros, and each section has a dominant number. Then the output lists those dominant numbers in order. For example, in the first part of Example 1's input, the arrays start with 4s, then 8s, then 3s. So the output is [4,8,3]. Then the next part of the input arrays have 1s, 2s, 8s, hence [1,2,8].\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the first part of the inputs have 2s and 7s, outputting [2,7], then 4s and 8s leading to [4,8], then 1s and 6s giving [1,6]. So the pattern is that each group of consecutive non-zero numbers (separated by zeros) in the input arrays is considered a \"segment\", and each segment's dominant number is taken. The output is the list of these dominant numbers in the order they appear across all input arrays. Also, if there's a zero-only array, maybe it's ignored.\n\nWait, but in the test input, there are multiple input arrays. Let's look at the test input. The test input has several arrays. Let me check the first few:\n\nThe first array is [3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,2,2,...]. So segments here are 3s, then another 3s after a zero, then 2s, then 4s. But according to the previous examples, maybe each input array is divided into groups separated by zeros, and each group's dominant number is taken. But how are the outputs structured?\n\nWait, looking back at the training examples, each training example's input is multiple arrays, and the output is a list of numbers. For instance, in Example 0, the output is two pairs: [1,8] and [6,1]. So maybe each array in the input contributes to part of the output. Let's see: the first group of arrays in Example 0's input all start with 1s and then 8s. The output is [1,8]. Then the next group of arrays start with 6s and then 1s, so the output is [6,1]. So perhaps each block of input arrays (before a zero array) is processed into a pair of the two dominant numbers in order.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, there's a zero array [0,0,0,...] that separates the first group of arrays (with 1s and 8s) from the second group (with 6s and 1s). Then the output is two entries: [1,8] and [6,1]. Similarly, in Example 1, the zero array is present, and the outputs are two triplets: [4,8,3] and [1,2,8]. So the pattern is: split the input arrays into groups separated by a zero array, then for each group, collect the dominant numbers from each array in the group, but wait, how?\n\nAlternatively, each input array is processed to extract a pair (or triplet) of numbers, and then all these are aggregated. But in the examples, each group of input arrays contributes to one output entry. For instance, in Example 0, the first set of arrays (before the zero array) have 1s followed by 8s. So each array in that group has 1s first, then 8s. The output for that group is [1,8]. Similarly, the next group of arrays (after the zero array) have 6s followed by 1s, so output [6,1].\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Split the input arrays into groups, separated by the all-zero array.\n\n2. For each group of arrays, look at each array in the group. Each array is divided into segments separated by zeros. The segments are consecutive non-zero elements. For each array, take the first number of each segment (or the dominant number in the segment, but maybe the first non-zero group and then the next).\n\nWait, in Example 0's first group of arrays, each array starts with 1s, then 8s. So each array contributes to the 1 and 8. Then the group's output is [1,8].\n\nSimilarly, the second group's arrays start with 6s, then 1s, leading to [6,1].\n\nSo for each array in the group, the non-zero segments are considered. Each segment's number is collected. Then, across all arrays in the group, the first two distinct numbers (in order of appearance) are taken for the output.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the first group's arrays have segments with 4s, 8s, and 3s. The output is [4,8,3]. So maybe each group of arrays has their segments' numbers, and the output is the unique numbers in the order they first appear across all arrays in the group.\n\nAlternatively, for each group of arrays, the output is the list of numbers that are the first elements of each segment in the arrays, ordered by their first occurrence.\n\nBut how to handle that. Let's take Example 0's first group:\n\nFirst array: [1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8]. The segments are 1s, then 1s, then 8s, then 8s. So the first segments are 1 and 8. Then in the next arrays of the same group, they also have 1 and 8 segments. So the output for the group is [1,8].\n\nSimilarly, the second group after the zero array has arrays starting with 6s and then 1s, so the output is [6,1].\n\nIn Example 1, the first group's arrays have 4, 8, 3. Then the second group after the zero array has 1,2,8.\n\nSo the output is the sequence of the first occurrence of each number in the order they appear in the group's segments.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Split the input arrays into groups separated by all-zero arrays.\n\n2. For each group:\n\n   a. For each array in the group, split into segments separated by zeros.\n\n   b. For each segment, note the number (all elements in the segment are the same? Or maybe the first element of the segment).\n\n   c. Collect all these numbers from all arrays in the group, maintaining the order of their first occurrence.\n\n   d. The output for the group is the list of these numbers in the order they first appeared.\n\nWait, but in the training examples, the outputs are lists of numbers, each corresponding to the group. So for the test input, we need to split the input into groups separated by all-zero arrays, process each group to collect the numbers of their segments in order of first appearance, and then output each group's list.\n\nNow, looking at the test input:\n\nThe test input starts with several arrays. Let's check for all-zero arrays. The fifth array is all zeros. Then the twentieth array is all zeros. So the groups are:\n\nGroup 1: arrays 0 to 4 (before the first zero array). Wait, no. The test input is a list of arrays. Let me list them:\n\nTest input arrays (assuming each line is an array):\n\n1. [3,3,3,0,...]\n2. [3,3,3,3,...]\n3. [0,3,0,0,3...]\n4. [3,0,3,3,...]\n5. [0,0,...] (all zeros)\n6. [1,1,1,1,0,1...]\n7. [1,1,1,0,1...]\n...\nThen at position 20: another all-zero array.\n\nThen after that, arrays starting with 7s, etc.\n\nSo the groups are:\n\nGroup 1: arrays 0-4 (array 5 is the first all-zero array)\n\nWait, no. The fifth array is index 4 (if we start from 0). Wait, the test input lists the arrays in order. Let's see:\n\nAfter the test input starts, the first array is:\n\n[3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nSecond array: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nThird array: [0,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nFourth array: [3,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nFifth array: [0,0,0,...] (all zeros)\n\nThen arrays 6 to 19 (assuming indexes 5 to 19 are the next arrays) until array 20, which is another all-zero array.\n\nThen arrays after array 20 (index 20) are [7,7,0,7,...], etc.\n\nSo the groups would be:\n\nGroup 1: arrays 0-4 (before the first all-zero array at index 4).\n\nGroup 2: arrays 5-19 (until the next all-zero array at index 20).\n\nGroup 3: arrays 21 to the end (since after index 20, the next array is index 21, which starts with 7s).\n\nWait, but array index 20 is the all-zero array, so the next group starts from array 21.\n\nSo for each group separated by all-zero arrays:\n\nGroup 1 (arrays 0-4):\n\nLooking at these arrays, let's process each array's segments.\n\nTake array 0: [3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nSegments are:\n\n3s (first four elements), then 3s after a zero, then 2s, then 4s, then 4s after a zero.\n\nSo segments: 3,3,2,4,4. But the output is supposed to collect unique numbers in order of first occurrence. So the first segments are 3, then 3 again (but same number), then 2, then 4. So the unique order is 3,2,4.\n\nWait, but maybe each array's first segment's number is taken, then next segments. Wait, perhaps the group's output is the ordered list of all the numbers that appear as the first element of each segment across all arrays in the group, but deduplicated in the order they first appear.\n\nBut how? Let's see in the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the first group's arrays have 1s followed by 8s. So each array in that group contributes 1 and 8. The output is [1,8]. So perhaps for each group, the output is the ordered list of the numbers that are the first elements of each segment in the arrays, but ordered as per their first occurrence across all arrays.\n\nBut let's process group 1 of the test input.\n\nGroup 1 (arrays 0-4):\n\nArray 0:\n\nSegments: 3 (positions 0-3), then after 0, 3 (positions 4-6), then 2 (positions 8-14), then 4 (positions 18-21), then 4 (positions 23-27). So segments' numbers are 3,3,2,4,4. The unique numbers in order are 3,2,4.\n\nArray 1:\n\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nSegments: 3 (0-6), then 2 (8-9), then 2 (11-14), then 4 (17-27). So numbers 3,2,2,4. Unique order: 3,2,4.\n\nArray 2:\n\n[0,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nSegments: 3 (positions 1), then 3 (4-5), then 2 (8-9), then 2 (12-14), then 4 (17-...). So numbers 3,3,2,2,4. Unique order: 3,2,4.\n\nArray 3:\n\n[3,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nSegments: 3 (0), then 3 (2-6), then 2 (8), then 2 (10-14), then 4 (19-...). Numbers:3,3,2,2,4. Unique order:3,2,4.\n\nArray 4: all zeros (so ignore?).\n\nSo combining all these arrays in group 1:\n\nThe first occurrence of each number in order: 3 comes first (from array 0's first segment), then 2 (from array 0's third segment), then 4 (from array 0's fourth segment). So the group's output would be [3,2,4].\n\nBut wait, looking at the training examples, the output for each group is the numbers in the order they first appear when processing all the arrays in the group. So perhaps even if in the same array, the first segments are processed first. For example, in group 1 of the test input, the first array's segments are 3,3,2,4,4. The unique numbers are 3,2,4. Then the next arrays in the group add to the order, but since 3,2,4 are already present, nothing changes. So the output for group 1 is [3,2,4].\n\nGroup 2: arrays 5-19 (since array 5 is the next after the first all-zero array, and the next all-zero array is array 20). Let's look at array 5:\n\nArray 5: [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0]\n\nSegments: 1s (0-4), 1 (6), 1 (8-9), 1 (12-14), 8 (16-18), 8 (20-24), 8 (26). So numbers:1,1,1,1,8,8,8. So unique order:1,8.\n\nArray 6: [1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,8,0]\n\nSegments: 1 (0-2), 1 (4), 1 (6), 1 (8-11), 1 (13-14), 8 (16-21), 8 (23), 8 (25-26). Numbers:1,8.\n\nSo unique order:1,8.\n\nArray 7: [1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8]\n\nSegments:1 (0), then 1 (2-6), then 1 (8-14), then 8 (16-22), 8 (24-27). Numbers:1,8.\n\nSo unique order:1,8.\n\nContinuing this, all the arrays in group 2 (arrays 5-19) have segments starting with 1 and 8. However, looking at array 5, there's also a segment after 8s, but maybe there's another number. Wait, array 5 has segments: 1,1,1,1,8,8,8. So all segments are 1 and 8. So the group's output for group 2 would be [1,8]. But wait, looking at the training examples, sometimes there are three numbers, like in Example 1. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, array 5's segments: first is 1s, then after a zero, another 1, then after zeros, another 1, then 8s, then 8s again. So in the group's processing, the first occurrence is 1, then 8. So output [1,8]. But let's check other arrays in group 2.\n\nLooking at array 6: starts with 1s, then 1 again, then 1, etc. So same pattern.\n\nBut maybe there's a third number in some arrays. For example, array 8:\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8]\n\nSegments:1,1,1,1,1,8,8. So numbers 1 and 8.\n\nWait, perhaps all the arrays in group 2 have only 1 and 8. Then the output would be [1,8]. But wait, maybe there's another number. Let's check array 19:\n\n[0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8]\n\nSegments:1 (position 1), 1 (3-6), 1 (8-10), 1 (12-13), 8 (16), 8 (18-22), 8 (25-27). So numbers 1,8.\n\nHmm. So group 2's output is [1,8].\n\nGroup 3: arrays 21 to the end (after the all-zero array at index 20). Let's look at array 21:\n\n[7,7,0,7,7,0,7,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,0,2,2]\n\nSegments:7,7,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2. So numbers 7,3,2.\n\nArray 22: [7,7,7,0,7,7,7,0,0,3,3,0,3,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0]\n\nSegments:7,7,3,3,3,2,2. So numbers 7,3,2.\n\nArray 23: [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nSegments:7,3,2. So numbers 7,3,2.\n\nSo the unique numbers in order are 7 (from array 21's first segment), then 3 (from array 21's fourth segment), then 2 (from array 21's seventh segment). So group 3's output is [7,3,2].\n\nBut the expected output for the test input would be each group's output in order. So the groups are:\n\nGroup 1: [3,2,4]\n\nGroup 2: [1,8]\n\nGroup 3: [7,3,2]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs are grouped per the input groups. For example, Example 0 has two outputs: [1,8] and [6,1], corresponding to the two groups after splitting by the zero array.\n\nSo for the test input, the output should be:\n\n[3,2,4]\n\n[1,8]\n\n[7,3,2]\n\nBut let me check the training examples again. In Example 2, the output is [2,7], [4,8], [1,6], which corresponds to three groups separated by zero arrays. Each group's output is the ordered first occurrence of the numbers in the segments.\n\nBut in group 3 of the test input, the output is [7,3,2]. But perhaps there's a mistake here. Let's re-examine.\n\nLooking at group 3 arrays (arrays 21-23):\n\nArray 21: segments are 7,7,7 (first segment is 7s), then 3s, then 2s. So numbers 7,3,2.\n\nArray 22: segments are 7s, then 3s, then 2s. So 7,3,2.\n\nArray 23: segments are 7s, then 3s, then 2s. So same order.\n\nSo the first occurrence in group 3 is 7, then 3, then 2. So the output should be [7,3,2].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the output for each group is the list of numbers in the order of their first occurrence in the segments across all arrays of the group.\n\nSo the final output for the test input would be:\n\n[3,2,4]\n\n[1,8]\n\n[7,3,2]\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the groups are [4,8,3] and [1,2,8], which are three elements each. So it's possible for a group to have more than two elements. So the test input's group 1 has three elements, group 2 two, group 3 three.\n\nBut let's verify if there's another group. The test input's group after the first zero array (array 4) is group 2: arrays 5-19. Then after array 20 (zero array), group 3 is arrays 21-23.\n\nSo the output should be three lines:\n\n[3,2,4]\n\n[1,8]\n\n[7,3,2]\n\nBut wait, the training examples have outputs that are in the same order as the groups. For example, Example 0's output is two lines, each corresponding to a group.\n\nSo the test output should be the outputs for each group, separated by newlines.\n\nThus, the final answer would be:\n\n[3,2,4]\n\n[1,8]\n\n[7,3,2]\n\nBut wait, looking back at the training examples, the outputs are given as lists separated by line breaks, but in the training examples, each group's output is a list. For instance, in Example 0, the output is:\n\n[1,8]\n\n[6,1]\n\nWhich corresponds to two groups. So the test output should follow the same pattern.\n\nSo in the test input, there are three groups (separated by two all-zero arrays), so three output lists.\n\nBut wait, the test input has two all-zero arrays. The first all-zero array is array 4 (index 4), then array 20 (index 20) is another all-zero array. So the groups are:\n\nGroup 1: arrays 0-4 (before first zero array)\n\nGroup 2: arrays 5-20 (after first zero array and before the next zero array at 20)\n\nWait, no. The first zero array is array 4. Then the next zero array is array 20. So group 2 is arrays 5-19 (since array 20 is the zero array that marks the end of group 2). Then group 3 is arrays 21-23 (after array 20).\n\nSo groups:\n\nGroup 1: arrays 0-4 (before first zero array)\n\nGroup 2: arrays 5-19 (between first and second zero arrays)\n\nGroup 3: arrays 21-23 (after second zero array)\n\nNow, group 2: arrays 5-19. Let's process them.\n\nFor example, array 5:\n\nSegments:1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0]\n\nSegments: 1s (0-4), 1 (6), 1 (8-9), 1 (12-14), 8 (16-18), 8 (20-24), 8 (26). So numbers 1,8.\n\nArray 6: segments are 1s, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8s, etc. So 1,8.\n\nArray 7: same.\n\nArray 8: [1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8]\n\nSegments:1,1,1,1,1,8,8. So 1,8.\n\nArray 9: [0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,8]\n\nSegments:1 (3-4), 1 (6), 1 (8), 1 (11-14), 8 (18-20), 8 (23-24), 8 (26-27). So 1,8.\n\nArray 10: [1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,8,0]\n\nSegments:1,1,1,1,8,8. So 1,8.\n\nArray 11: [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,8,8]\n\nSegments:1,1,1,8. So 1,8.\n\nArray 12: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8]\n\nSegments:1,1,8,8. So 1,8.\n\nArray 13: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nSegments:1,1,1,1,8. So 1,8.\n\nArray 14: [1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0]\n\nSegments:1,1,1,8. So 1,8.\n\nArray 15: [1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nSegments:1,1,1,1,8. So 1,8.\n\nArray 16: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,8,8]\n\nSegments:1,1,1,8. So 1,8.\n\nArray 17: [1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8]\n\nSegments:1,1,1,8. So 1,8.\n\nArray 18: [0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8]\n\nSegments:1,1,1,1,8. So 1,8.\n\nArray 19: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, array 19 is the all-zero array? Wait, no, array 20 is the all-zero array. So array 19 is not. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the test input lists the arrays in order. The arrays after array 4 (all-zero) are from array 5 to array 20. Then array 20 is all zeros. Then arrays 21-23.\n\nSo group 2 consists of arrays 5-19 (indexes 5 to 19 inclusive). Let's check array 19:\n\nArray 19: [0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8]\n\nSegments:1 (position 1), 1 (3-6), 1 (8-10), 1 (12-13), 8 (16), 8 (18-22), 8 (25-27). So numbers 1,8.\n\nSo all arrays in group 2 have segments starting with 1 and 8, in that order. So the group's output is [1,8].\n\nGroup 3 (arrays 21-23):\n\nArray 21: [7,7,0,7,7,0,7,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,0,2,2]\n\nSegments:7 (0-1), then 7 (3-4), 7 (6), 3 (8-9), 3 (12-14), 2 (16), 2 (18-21), 2 (23-24), 2 (26-27). So numbers in order:7,3,2.\n\nArray 22: [7,7,7,0,7,7,7,0,0,3,3,0,3,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0]\n\nSegments:7 (0-2), 7 (4-6), 3 (8-9), 3 (12), 2 (16-20), 2 (22-25). So numbers:7,3,2.\n\nArray 23: [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nSegments:7 (0-6), 3 (8-14), 2 (16-27). So numbers:7,3,2.\n\nThus, group 3's output is [7,3,2].\n\nPutting it all together, the output for the test input should be:\n\n[3,2,4]\n\n[1,8]\n\n[7,3,2]\n\nBut let me check if there's any mistake here.\n\nWait, in group 1, the first array's first segment is 3s, then another segment of 3s after a zero. So the segments are 3,3,2,4,4. The first time 3 appears, then again 3 (but already in the list), then 2 (new), then 4 (new). So the order is 3,2,4.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the first group's output is [3,2,4].\n\nThe second group's output is [1,8], as all arrays in that group contribute only 1 and 8 in order.\n\nThe third group's output is [7,3,2], as per their segments.\n\nSo the final answer should be three lines:\n\n[3,2,4]\n\n[1,8]\n\n[7,3,2]\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, the outputs don't have triple entries. For example, Example 1 has two groups with three numbers each. So the answer structure seems correct.\n\nThus, the final answer is as above.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input has multiple arrays, and the output is a list of pairs. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the input arrays have numbers like 1, 0, 8. The output is [1,8] and [6,1]. Hmm. Maybe each pair corresponds to a group of numbers in the input arrays. Like, maybe each array in the input is split into two parts: the first part has 1s and 0s, then 8s and 0s. The output pairs might be the first non-zero number in each part. Wait, let's check the first array of Example 0: [1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8]. The first part before 8s starts with 1s, then the second part is 8s. So the first element of the output is 1, and the second is 8. Then the next arrays in the example have 6 and 1. Looking at one of those arrays: [6,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0]. The first part is 6s and 0s, then the second part has 1s. So the output pairs are the dominant number in each part.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that each input array is divided into two segments. The first segment consists of the numbers before the first occurrence of a different non-zero number. Wait, but how do we split the array? Let me think again. Let's look at Example 0's output. The first part of each array seems to alternate between 1s and 0s, then switches to 8s. So maybe each array is split into two groups: the numbers before the first occurrence of 8, and then the 8s. But in some arrays, there's a transition from 6s to 1s, like in the later arrays of Example 0. So the output pairs are the first number in each group.\n\nWait, in the first example of Example 0, the output is [1,8]. The first part has 1s and 0s, but the first non-zero is 1. The second part starts with 8. Similarly, the next arrays in Example 0 have [6,1], where the first part is 6s and the second part is 1s.\n\nIn Example 1, the output is [4,8,3] and [1,2,8]. Looking at the input arrays, the first part has 4s and 0s, then 8s, then 3s. Then another group starts with 1s, 2s, then 8s. So the output is the first non-zero number in each of the three segments. Wait, but how are the segments divided? Let's take the first input array in Example 1: [4,4,4,4,4,0,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3]. So the first part is 4s, then 8s, then 3s. So the output is 4,8,3. Similarly, the next arrays have 1,2,8. So maybe the input arrays are divided into consecutive non-zero numbers (ignoring zeros), and the output is the numbers in the order of their first occurrence in each segment. But how exactly are the segments divided?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input array is divided into sequences separated by zeros. But in the first example of Example 0, the array starts with 1s, then 0s, then 1s again. Wait, but the first array in Example 0 is [1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8]. The output is [1,8]. So the first segment is 1s (including the 1s after the zeros?), and the second segment is 8s. Hmm. Maybe the first non-zero number in the array is the first element of the output, and then the next non-zero number that's different from the first becomes the second element. But in the first array, after the initial 1s, there are 0s, then more 1s, then 0s, then 8s. So maybe the output is the first non-zero number and the next non-zero number that comes after any zeros. So in that case, 1 and 8. Then in another array, like [6,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0], the first non-zero is 6, and the next after some zeros is 1, so output [6,1].\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's first input, the output is [4,8,3], which are the first non-zero numbers in each of three distinct groups. But how? The first array in Example1's input has 4s followed by 8s then 3s. So perhaps each time a new non-zero number appears after zeros, it's part of a new group. So the output is the sequence of distinct non-zero numbers in the order they first appear, ignoring zeros. But how about the zeros between them?\n\nWait, the input arrays in Example0's first example have multiple 1s and 8s. But maybe the output is formed by taking the first occurrence of a non-zero number, then the next non-zero number that is different after the first group. So the first group is the first run of non-zeros (even if interspersed with zeros?), followed by the next run.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each array is processed into groups where each group consists of a non-zero number and any subsequent zeros. For example, the first array in Example0 would have groups: [1,1,1,1], [0,0], [1,1], [0,0,0], [8,8,8,8,8], [0], [8,8,8]. Then, the output would be the numbers of the first two groups that are non-zero. Wait, but the output is [1,8]. The first non-zero group is 1, then after that, the next non-zero group is 8. So the output is the first and next non-zero group's numbers.\n\nIn the second example of Example0, the input arrays have 6s followed by 1s, so output [6,1]. So the output is the first and next distinct non-zero group numbers.\n\nIn Example1, the first output is [4,8,3], which are the first three distinct group numbers. Then the second part of the input has 1,2,8 as the groups.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each array in the input, split into groups where each group is a run of the same non-zero number (ignoring zeros in between?), then collect the first occurrence of each number in the order they appear. But wait, how are the groups split? For example, in the first array of Example0, after the initial 1s, there are 0s, then 1s again. But those 1s would be part of the same group as the first 1s if zeros are ignored. But the output is [1,8], implying that between the first 1s and the 8s, there's a transition. So perhaps zeros act as separators between groups. So each time a non-zero number is encountered after a zero (or sequence of zeros), it's considered a new group if it's a different number. But if the same number appears again after zeros, it's still part of the same group?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's take Example0's first array again: [1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8]. The zeros separate the 1s into two parts. But the output is [1,8], not [1,1,8]. So perhaps consecutive runs of the same number separated by zeros are considered the same group. Or perhaps the zeros are ignored when determining groups, so the first group is all 1s (including those after zeros) until a new non-zero number appears. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the groups are determined by the first occurrence of a number, and any subsequent occurrences of the same number (even after zeros) are considered part of the same group. But how does that split into the output? Maybe the output is the sequence of distinct non-zero numbers in the order they first appear in the array. Let's check.\n\nIn the first array of Example0, the distinct numbers in order are 1, 8. So output [1,8]. The second array in Example0's input is [1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. The distinct numbers are 1, 8. So output [1,8]. But then in the next array, [1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], the numbers are 1,8. So output [1,8]. Wait, but the outputs for Example0 are [1,8] and [6,1], which suggests that different arrays in the input contribute to different parts of the output. Wait, looking back at the training examples, each example's input is multiple arrays, and the output is multiple pairs. For example, Example0's input has 20 arrays, and the output has two pairs: [1,8] and [6,1]. So perhaps each array in the input is processed into a pair, and the output is all the unique pairs in the order they first appear.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's input, there are 20 arrays. The first 8 arrays (excluding the all-zero array) probably start with 1 and then 8. Then the next arrays start with 6 and then 1. So the output is the two unique pairs: [1,8] and [6,1]. Similarly, in Example1, the first group of arrays (before the all-zero) have 4,8,3. Then after the all-zero array, the next arrays have 1,2,8. So the output is [4,8,3] and [1,2,8]. Example2's output has three pairs: [2,7], [4,8], [1,6]. So each group of arrays (separated by the all-zero array) contributes a pair to the output.\n\nAh, this makes sense. So the input arrays are grouped into blocks separated by an all-zero array. Each block is a set of arrays, and for each block, the output is a pair (or triplet) of the first non-zero numbers in each segment of the arrays. But how exactly?\n\nWait, the all-zero array acts as a separator. In Example0's input, after the first 8 arrays, there's an all-zero array, then the next arrays start with 6 and 1. So the output is two pairs: one from the first block (before the all-zero) and one from the second block (after the all-zero). Similarly, in Example1, there's an all-zero array separating the first block (4,8,3) and the second block (1,2,8). In Example2, there are two all-zero arrays: the first after the 2 and 7 arrays, then another after the 4 and 8 arrays, leading to three blocks, hence three output pairs.\n\nSo the pattern is: split the input arrays into blocks separated by all-zero arrays. For each block, process each array to get a pair of numbers (the first non-zero number in the array and the next distinct non-zero number that follows after any zeros). Then, collect all unique such pairs from each block and output them in order.\n\nWait, but in Example0, the first block has multiple arrays, but all of them result in the same pair [1,8]. Then the second block (after all-zero) has arrays that result in [6,1]. So the output is each unique pair from each block.\n\nBut how exactly to get the pair from each array in the block. For each array, find the first two distinct non-zero numbers in the order they appear. For example, in an array like [1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8], the first non-zero is 1, then the next distinct non-zero is 8. So pair [1,8]. For an array like [6,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0], first non-zero is 6, then next is 1. So [6,1]. The same applies to other arrays. Then, within each block (group of arrays separated by all-zero), all arrays produce the same pair, so the output is just that pair once.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Split the input arrays into blocks separated by all-zero arrays.\n\n2. For each block, take each array in the block and extract the first two distinct non-zero numbers in the order they appear. (But if an array doesn't have two distinct non-zero numbers, maybe it's ignored or contributes a single-element pair? But in the training examples, all arrays in a block produce the same pair.)\n\n3. The output is the list of pairs from each block, where each pair is unique and appears once per block.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nThe test input has multiple arrays. Let's look for all-zero arrays to split the blocks.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nFirst array: [3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nSecond array: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nThird array: [0,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nFourth array: [3,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nFifth array: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 this is an all-zero array, so it's a separator.\n\nThen arrays 5 to 19 are next, then another all-zero array at position 19 (assuming 0-based index). Then after that, arrays 20 to 23.\n\nWait, the test input is presented as a list. Let me parse them:\n\nTest Input Arrays:\n\n1. [3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4]\n\n2. [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\n3. [0,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\n4. [3,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\n5. [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 separator.\n\n6. [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0]\n\n7. [1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,8,0]\n\n8. [1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8]\n\n... and so on until array 19.\n\nThen array 20: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 another separator.\n\nThen arrays 21, 22, 23: \n\n21. [7,7,0,7,7,0,7,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,0,2,2]\n\n22. [7,7,7,0,7,7,7,0,0,3,3,0,3,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0]\n\n23. [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nSo the test input has three blocks separated by two all-zero arrays. The first block is arrays 0-4 (assuming 0-based index) which are before the first all-zero array (array 4). The second block is arrays 5-19, then array 20 is another all-zero. The third block is arrays 21-23.\n\nNow, for each block, we need to determine the output pairs.\n\nFirst block (arrays 0-4): Each array starts with 3, then 2, then 4. Let's take array 0: [3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4]. The first non-zero is 3. Then after some zeros, the next distinct non-zero is 2. Then after zeros, next is 4. So the pair would be [3,2,4]. But wait, the output in Example1's first block is [4,8,3], a triplet. So when there are three distinct numbers in the order they first appear, the output is a triplet. So for this first block, the arrays have 3, 2, 4 in order. So the output for this block would be [3,2,4].\n\nWait, but let's check array 0. The array starts with 3s, then 0s, then 3s again (but same number). Then zeros, then 2s, then zeros, then 4s. So the first three distinct non-zero numbers are 3, 2, 4. So the output triplet would be [3,2,4]. Then array 1: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. First is 3, then 2, then 4. Similarly for arrays 2-4. So this block's output is [3,2,4].\n\nSecond block (arrays 5-19): These arrays start with 1s and then 8s. For example, array5: [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0]. First non-zero is 1, then after zeros, next is 8. So pair [1,8]. Let's check another array in this block. Array6: [1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,8,0]. First non-zero is 1, then 8. So same pair [1,8]. All arrays in this block would produce [1,8]. So the output for this block is [1,8].\n\nThird block (arrays 21-23): Array21: [7,7,0,7,7,0,7,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,0,2,2]. First non-zero is 7, then 3, then 2. So triplet [7,3,2]. But array22: [7,7,7,0,7,7,7,0,0,3,3,0,3,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0]. First is 7, then 3, then 2. Array23: [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]. First is 7, then 3, then 2. So the output for this block is [7,3,2].\n\nBut wait, in Example2's third block, the output was [1,6], which corresponds to arrays starting with 1s and then 6s. So the first two distinct numbers. So in the test input's third block, the first two distinct numbers are 7 and 3, then 2. But in the training examples, the outputs are pairs (like [2,7], [4,8], [1,6] in Example2). But Example1's output has triplets. So perhaps the output for a block is the sequence of all distinct non-zero numbers in the order they first appear in the arrays of the block, but grouped into pairs? Or perhaps the output is the first two distinct numbers in each array, and if the block's arrays all have the same first two, then output that pair. But this third block's arrays all have 7,3,2 as the first three distinct numbers. But the training examples sometimes have triplets (Example1's first output is [4,8,3]). So it's possible that the output is a list of the distinct numbers in the order they appear, regardless of how many.\n\nBut looking back at the training examples:\n\nExample0: Output has pairs [1,8] and [6,1].\n\nExample1: Output has [4,8,3] and [1,2,8].\n\nExample2: Output has pairs [2,7], [4,8], [1,6].\n\nSo the number of elements in each output part depends on how many distinct numbers are first appearing in each block. For example, in Example1's first block, the output is three elements, but in Example0's first block, it's two.\n\nThus, for the test input:\n\nFirst block: [3,2,4]\n\nSecond block: [1,8]\n\nThird block: [7,3,2]\n\nBut wait, the third block's arrays first have 7, then 3, then 2. So the output would be [7,3,2]. But in Example1's output, the first triplet is [4,8,3], which suggests that the order is based on the first occurrence in the entire block. Let me check array21 again. The first array in the third block (array21) is [7,7,0,7,7,0,7,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,0,2,2]. The first non-zero is 7, then after zeros, next non-zero is 3, then after zeros, next is 2. So the order is 7,3,2. Similarly for array22 and 23. So the third block's output should be [7,3,2].\n\nBut let's check if in the training examples, the output lists the order of first occurrence in the entire array. For example, in Example1's first block:\n\nInput arrays have 4, then 8, then 3. So output [4,8,3].\n\nSo the output lists the distinct numbers in the order they first appear in the arrays of the block.\n\nTherefore, the test input's output would be:\n\nFirst block: [3,2,4]\n\nSecond block: [1,8]\n\nThird block: [7,3,2]\n\nBut wait, let's check the order. For the first block's arrays:\n\nThe first array (array0) starts with 3, then 3s, then 2s, then 4s. So first three distinct numbers are 3,2,4.\n\nArray1: starts with 3, then 2, then 4. Same order.\n\nArray2: starts with 0, then 3, then 2, then 4. So first non-zero is 3, then 2, then 4.\n\nArray3: starts with 3, then 3s, then 2, then 4.\n\nSo all arrays in the first block contribute to the order 3\u21922\u21924.\n\nSecond block's arrays start with 1s and 8s, so order is 1\u21928.\n\nThird block's arrays start with 7, then 3, then 2. So order is 7\u21923\u21922.\n\nThus, the output should be:\n\n[3, 2, 4]\n\n[1, 8]\n\n[7, 3, 2]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, each output part has the same number of elements as the number of distinct non-zero numbers in the block. For example, Example1's first block has three distinct numbers (4,8,3) and outputs a triplet. The second block has three numbers (1,2,8) and outputs a triplet. But Example0's first block has two numbers (1,8), and the second block has two (6,1). Example2's first block has two (2,7), second block two (4,8), third block two (1,6). Wait, no. Example2's test input has three output pairs. Let me check again.\n\nExample2's input has:\n\nFirst block (before all-zero array): arrays with 2s and 7s. The output is [2,7].\n\nThen, after all-zero, the next block has arrays with 4s and 8s. Output [4,8].\n\nThen another all-zero array, then arrays with 1s and 6s. Output [1,6].\n\nSo each of those blocks has two distinct numbers, hence pairs. But in the test input's first and third blocks, there are three distinct numbers each. So their outputs would be triplets. However, looking at the training examples, Example1 has triplets. So the output can have pairs or triplets depending on the block.\n\nThus, the test input's output should be:\n\n[3,2,4]\n\n[1,8]\n\n[7,3,2]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the output is written as lists separated by newlines. For example, Example0's output is:\n\n[1,8]\n\n[6,1]\n\nSimilarly, Example1's output is:\n\n[4,8,3]\n\n[1,2,8]\n\nExample2's output:\n\n[2,7]\n\n[4,8]\n\n[1,6]\n\nSo, the test input's output should be three lines:\n\n[3,2,4]\n\n[1,8]\n\n[7,3,2]\n\nBut wait, looking at the third block's arrays. Let's take array21: [7,7,0,7,7,0,7,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,0,2,2]. The first non-zero is 7, then next is 3, then 2. So the triplet is 7,3,2. array22: [7,7,7,0,7,7,7,0,0,3,3,0,3,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0]. The first non-zero is 7, then 3, then 2. array23: [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]. First is 7, then 3, then 2. So the triplet is correct.\n\nSo the final output for the test input would be:\n\n[3, 2, 4]\n\n[1, 8]\n\n[7, 3, 2]\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the outputs for each block are lists of the distinct numbers in the order they first appeared, but in the test input, the third block's triplet is [7,3,2], but in array21, the numbers after 7 are 3 and then 2. So this order is preserved.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the final answer should be three lines, each representing the triplet or pair for each block.",
