        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I've got these training examples where the input is transformed into the output. My job is to see what's changing and apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input has a cluster of 3s and 1s in the middle, and 4s and 1s at the bottom. The output seems to expand those clusters. Like the 4s in rows 9 and 10 of the input become surrounded by more 4s in the output. Also, the 1s in the input become 1s in the output but the 4s around them expand. Maybe there's some kind of expansion or replication happening around non-zero numbers.\n\nExample 1: The input has an 8 in the second row and some 2 and 6 later. The output adds more 6s around the original 6, forming a cross maybe? Also, the 2 and 3 in row 12 expand into a 3x3 area. So maybe numbers spread outwards in certain directions, or create a cross pattern around themselves.\n\nExample 2: The input has a square of 8s and 4s. The output expands those into a larger square with surrounding 8s. Like the 8s and 4s are creating a border around themselves. So perhaps each number is creating a frame around their original position, expanding outward.\n\nExample 3: The input has a 3, 2, and some 8s and 4s. The output adds 3s around the original 3 and 2, and the 4s and 2s also spread. The 4s in the lower rows become a bigger block. It looks like numbers are expanding to form a sort of diamond or cross shape, maybe based on their value?\n\nPutting this together, maybe the rule is that each non-zero cell in the input causes certain adjacent cells to be filled with the same number in the output. The direction or pattern of expansion might depend on the value of the number. For example, some numbers might spread horizontally and vertically, forming a cross, while others form a square around them. Or maybe each number has a specific radius of expansion. Like, 3 might spread one cell in all directions, 4 might spread two cells, etc.\n\nLooking at Example 0 again: The 3s in the input form a cross in the output. The 4s in the input (row 9,10) become a larger block in the output. The 1s stay the same but are surrounded by 4s. So perhaps the transformation is creating a cross or plus shape around each non-zero cell. For instance, a cell with value N creates a cross of N in the output, extending N cells in each direction? Wait, in Example 0, the 3 in row 2, column 3 (assuming 0-based) might spread to adjacent cells. But the output has 3s in a cross pattern. Similarly, the 4s in the lower part of the input spread into a larger block.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is creating a border around clusters. Like, any cell adjacent to a non-zero cell in the input gets filled with the same number. But that might not explain all cases. For example, in Example 2, the input has 3 rows of 8s and 3 rows of 4s. The output adds surrounding 8s around them, creating a bigger square. So each group of numbers is surrounded by the same number, expanding outward by one layer. But in that example, the output has 8s around the original 8s, then 4s inside. Wait, the input has 8s in rows 7-9 (indices 7-9) and 4s in 10-12. The output in those areas has more 8s surrounding the original 8s and 4s, then a layer of 8s again. Maybe it's like each group is expanded by one cell in all directions, replacing zeros with the same number. But how does that apply to different examples?\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input and output: The 6 in the input is at position (row 7, column 11). The output has 6s in a cross around it. So maybe each number spreads in a cross shape (up, down, left, right) by a certain number of cells. The original 6 becomes the center, and the output adds cells in those directions. For example, a 6 might spread one cell in each direction. Similarly, the 8 in the input of Example 0 is in row 1, column 5 (if counting starts at 0). The output doesn't change that row, but in other examples, maybe the expansion is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero cell in the input creates a diamond-shaped region in the output. The size of the diamond depends on the cell's value. For instance, a cell with value N creates a diamond of radius N. But looking at the examples, that might not fit. In Example 0, the 3s form a cross that's 3 cells in some direction. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: Compare each input and output grid cell by cell. For each cell in the output, check if it's non-zero. Then see if that corresponds to any rule based on the input. For example, in Example 0's output, the 4s in rows 9 and 10 (input) have expanded to rows 9-10 and columns 5-8 (output), forming a larger block. The original 4s were in columns 5-6. So perhaps each 4 in the input creates a 2x2 block in the output. But in Example 2, the 4s in the input (rows 10-12, columns 9-11) become part of a larger 3x3 block surrounded by 8s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each non-zero cell in the input is the center of a certain shape in the output, and overlapping shapes are combined. For example, a cell with value 3 might create a 3x3 cross (like a plus sign) in the output. So, the original cell and the cells above, below, left, and right get set to 3. Then, if another cell's influence overlaps, their values might overwrite or combine.\n\nWait, let's take Example 3's input. The original 3 is at row 2, column 4 (0-based). In the output, there's a cross of 3s around it. So row 2, columns 3-5 have 3s. Then in row 1, column 5 (the original input had a 2 there?), maybe the 2's influence is different. The output in Example 3's input has a 3 next to the 2, but perhaps that's from another cell.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to find a pattern for each number. For example, in Example 0, the 3s in the input (rows 1-3, columns 2-4) become a cross in the output. The center 3s remain, and the surrounding cells are filled. The 1 in the middle (row 2, column 4) stays a 1, but around it are 3s. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each non-zero cell in the input causes the cells in the output that are a certain Manhattan distance away to become that number. For example, a cell with value N affects all cells at Manhattan distance less than or equal to N. So, a 3 would create a diamond shape of radius 3. But in Example 0, the 3 in row 1, column 3 (input) would create a diamond that includes cells up to 3 steps away. However, the output in Example 0's 3 area doesn't seem that large. Alternatively, perhaps the value determines the size of the cross. For example, value N means the cross extends N cells in each direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by applying a convolution or kernel that depends on the cell's value. For example, a 3 would apply a 3x3 kernel, setting neighboring cells to 3. But how does that explain the different patterns in the examples?\n\nAnother approach: Looking for symmetry. In Example 2's output, the 8s form a symmetrical square around the original 8s. Similarly, the 4s are in the center. It looks like each layer of numbers is expanded outward. Perhaps the output layers different numbers, with higher numbers overwriting lower ones? Or perhaps each number's expansion is based on its value, with higher values creating larger patterns.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as a kind of \"growth\" from each non-zero cell. For example, each cell grows in all directions by a number of steps equal to its value. So a cell with value 3 would spread 3 cells in all directions, replacing zeros. But when cells overlap, perhaps the highest value takes precedence, or the sum, but in the examples, overlapping areas seem to take the value of the originating cell.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the 4s in the lower part form a sort of larger rectangle. The original 4s are in two rows, columns 5-6. The output has rows 9-10 with 4s expanded to columns 3-8, and rows 11-12 with 4s in columns 5-6 again. That seems like the 4s have expanded horizontally and vertically. Maybe each 4 in the input causes a horizontal and vertical expansion of 4 cells? Or perhaps it's a certain number of cells based on the value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each non-zero cell in the input creates a diamond-shaped area around it in the output, where the size of the diamond is determined by the cell's value. For example, a cell with value N creates a diamond with radius N. Let's test this with Example 0. The 3 in row 1, column 3 would create a diamond of radius 3. But looking at the output, the 3s form a cross around it. Maybe the diamond is being cropped by the grid boundaries.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number's value determines how many layers it spreads. For example, a 3 spreads three layers outward. Each layer being a ring around the original cell. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output: The input has a 4 in row 9, column 6 (maybe). The output has a block of 4s expanding to the left. So maybe the 4s expand left and right by 2 cells each, creating a 5-cell wide block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero cell in the input causes the output to have a square around it. For example, a cell with value N creates an NxN square centered at the original cell. But that doesn't quite fit. For instance, a 3 would create a 3x3 square, but in Example 0, the 3s are in a cross pattern.\n\nHmm. Another angle: Perhaps the output is the result of each non-zero cell in the input \"activating\" certain surrounding cells. For example, if a cell has value k, then in the output, all cells that are at a distance less than k from it (in some metric) are set to k. This could be Manhattan distance, Euclidean, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by a cellular automaton step where each cell looks at its neighbors and propagates its value. But the examples show that the output cells are often larger expansions than just immediate neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern might involve flipping or mirroring parts of the grid. But the examples don't show symmetry in that way.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the 8s are in rows 7-9, columns 9-11. The output adds a layer of 8s around them, creating a larger block. So rows 7-9 become 7-9+1=7-10? Wait, the output's rows 7-9 have 8s expanding to columns 6-14, which is a much larger expansion. So the input's 3x3 block of 8s becomes a 3x9 block in the output. That doesn't fit a simple expansion. Maybe each 8 in the input is part of a larger pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a grid that's a certain multiple of the original. But the input and output grids in the examples are the same size. So scaling isn't the answer.\n\nLooking at the test input: It has 8s, 1s, 4s, 1s, then later some 1s and 2s, and 3s. Following the pattern from the examples, each of these clusters should expand in certain ways. For example, the 8s in rows 2-3, columns 4-5 might expand into a cross or a diamond. The 4s in row 3-5, columns 10-12 might expand into a larger block. The 1s and 2s at the bottom right (rows 7-10, columns 21-28) might form a cross or expand into their own patterns.\n\nPutting all this together, the pattern seems to be that each non-zero cell in the input causes certain adjacent cells in the output to take on the same value. The exact pattern of expansion varies based on the number, possibly as follows:\n\n- For numbers like 3, 8, 4, etc., the expansion is to create a cross (up, down, left, right) of length equal to the number's value. For example, a 3 would extend 3 cells in each direction.\n- Alternatively, the expansion could be a diamond shape where the number's value determines the radius.\n- In some cases, like Example 2, the expansion creates a larger block, which might be due to multiple adjacent cells expanding and overlapping.\n- The 1s in the examples don't seem to expand much; perhaps they only affect immediate neighbors.\n\nBut this is getting a bit vague. Let's try to formalize a possible rule based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: The 6 in the input (row 7, column 11) becomes a horizontal line of 6s in the output (row 7, columns 10-13), and a vertical line (rows 6-8, column 13). So maybe the 6 creates a cross: one cell to the left, right, up, and down, and possibly more based on the value. But 6's expansion here seems to be three cells in one direction. Wait, the output has 6s in row 7, columns 11-13, and row 7, column 10. Also, in rows 6-8, column 13. So it's a cross but maybe extended further in some directions. Alternatively, the expansion is in all four directions for a certain number of steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number indicates the number of cells to expand in each direction. For example, a 6 would expand 6 cells in each direction. But that's not feasible in Example 1's case, as the grid isn't large enough. Alternatively, the number is the length of the cross arms. For example, a 6 would have a cross of length 6 in each direction, but in Example 1's case, it's only extending 3 cells (columns 10-13 is 4 cells, but maybe the original cell is included).\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let's look for a different approach. Maybe each non-zero cell in the input is the center of a cross (horizontal and vertical lines) in the output, with the length of each arm being equal to the cell's value. So, for a cell with value N, the output will have a cross extending N cells up, down, left, and right from that cell. Overlapping crosses from different cells would combine, possibly overwriting each other based on order or value.\n\nTesting this hypothesis against the examples:\n\nExample 0: The 3 in the input (row 1, column 3) would create a cross extending 3 cells in each direction. That would mean from row 1-4 and column 3, and row 1, columns 0-6. But in the output, the 3s are in a cross shape around that cell. It seems to fit, but maybe the actual length is N cells, including the original. So a 3 would create a cross of 3 cells in each direction, including the center. So the total length is 2*3 +1 =7? But in the output for Example 0, the 3s are in a vertical line of 3 cells (rows 1-3, column 3) and a horizontal line of 3 cells (row 2, columns 1-5). Hmm, that's a cross with arms of length 2 (excluding the center). So maybe the arm length is the cell's value minus 1. For example, a 3 would have arms of 2 cells each way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell's value determines the number of layers around it. For example, a 3 would create three layers, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, think of the cell's value as the radius. For a cross shape, radius 1 would mean one cell in each direction. So a value of 3 would have a radius of 3, making the cross extend 3 cells in each direction. But in Example 0's output, the vertical line of 3s is 3 cells (rows 1-3), which is a radius of 1 (from row 2, column 3). Hmm, conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cell's value is the number of times to apply a spread. For example, each non-zero cell spreads its value to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) a number of times equal to its value. So a value of 3 would spread three times. But this would create a diamond-shaped area. However, in Example 0, the 3's spread seems to only affect adjacent cells once.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Let's try to see if there's a pattern in how the output cells are positioned relative to the input.\n\nTake Example 0's input row 9 and 10 with 4s. In the output, those 4s are surrounded by more 4s. For instance, row 9 in the input has 4s in columns 5-6. In the output, row 9 has 4s in columns 3-8, and rows 8-9 in columns 5-6. Wait, no. Looking at the output for Example 0:\n\nInput rows 9-10 (0-based?) have 4s in columns 5-6. The output has rows 9-10 with 4s in columns 3-8, and rows 7-8 and 11-12 with 4s in columns 5-6. So it's like a plus sign: the original 4s are extended horizontally and vertically. The horizontal extension is two cells to the left and right (from column 5-6 to 3-8), and vertically two cells up and down (from rows 9-10 to 7-10 and 9-12). But how does that relate to the value 4?\n\nWait, the value is 4, and the horizontal spread is 4 cells in each direction? Wait, from column 5-6, spreading 4 left and right would go from 5-4=1 to 6+4=10, but the output has columns 3-8. That's a spread of 3 to the left (5-3=2) and 2 to the right (6 to 8=2). Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the value 4 means the spread is 2 cells in each direction (4/2). But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output creates a cross where the horizontal and vertical arms are each of length equal to the cell's value. For example, a 4 would spread 4 cells left, right, up, and down. But in Example 0's 4s, the horizontal spread is from column 5-6 to 3-8, which is 3 cells left (5\u21923) and 2 cells right (6\u21928). That's a total of 5 cells horizontally. If the value is 4, maybe the arms are length 2 in each direction (4/2). But this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to apply a possible pattern to the test input.\n\nThe test input has:\n\nRow 3: 8, 1, 8 (columns 3-5, maybe) and 4s in columns 10-12 for rows 3-5. Then later, in rows 7-10, columns 21-28, there are 1s and 2s. Also, rows 10-11 have 1,1 and 3,3.\n\nAssuming the pattern is that each non-zero cell creates a horizontal and vertical line of its value in the output, extending a certain number of cells. For example, 8 would create lines extending 8 cells, but that's not feasible. Alternatively, each cell's value determines how many cells away to fill. For example, 8 might fill 8 cells in each direction, but that's not possible in the grid. So maybe the value is the number of cells to extend in each direction. For example, 8 extends 8 cells, but since the grid is limited, it fills up to the edge.\n\nAlternatively, the number indicates the length of the cross arms. For example, a cell with value 8 would have arms of length 8. But again, the grid isn't that big. So maybe the number is the number of layers. For example, 8 creates 8 layers around it.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are simply identifiers, and each number corresponds to a specific pattern. For example, 8 creates a 3x3 square, 4 creates a horizontal line, etc. But how to determine which number corresponds to which pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror or flip certain parts of the grid. For example, in Example 2's output, the 8s are mirrored around the original 8s. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. Looking at Example 0's output, the 4s in the lower part form a sort of H-shape: two horizontal lines and a vertical line connecting them. Similarly, the 3s form a cross. Example 2's output has the 8s forming a larger square around the original 8s and 4s.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that each non-zero cell in the input creates a cross (horizontal and vertical lines) of length equal to the cell's value. When multiple cells are adjacent, their crosses overlap, and the highest value or the sum is taken. Alternatively, the crosses are combined.\n\nIn the test input, the 8s in row 2-3, columns 4-5 might create crosses extending 8 cells each way. But since the grid is limited, it would fill to the edges. The 4s in rows 3-5, columns 10-12 would create crosses of length 4. The 1s and 2s in rows 7-10, columns 21-28 would create shorter crosses.\n\nFor example, the 4s would extend 4 cells in each direction. So the horizontal line would extend from column 10-12 to 10-4=6 to 12+4=16. But the input's 4s are in columns 10-12, rows 3-5. Their crosses would create horizontal lines from columns 6-16 and vertical lines from rows -1 (which is invalid) to 9. But since the grid has limited size, it would fill up to the edges. This might result in expanding the 4s to cover more columns and rows around them.\n\nSimilarly, the 2s in the lower right (columns 25-28) would extend crosses of length 2, creating horizontal and vertical lines around them.\n\nThe 3s in rows 12-13, column 6 would create crosses of length 3, possibly extending to cover surrounding cells.\n\nPutting this all together, the test output would have expanded areas around each non-zero cell in the input, forming crosses or other shapes based on their values. However, without a clear rule, this is speculative.\n\nGiven the examples, the safest bet is to assume that each non-zero cell creates a cross in the output (horizontal and vertical lines) extending a certain number of cells based on their value. The exact number might be the value itself, leading to longer arms for higher values. Applying this to the test input:\n\n- The 8s in rows 2-3, columns 4-5 would create long horizontal and vertical lines. But since 8 is a high number, they might extend to the edges of the grid.\n- The 4s in rows 3-5, columns 10-12 would create lines extending 4 cells in each direction, covering more area.\n- The 1s and 2s would create shorter crosses.\n- The 3s in rows 12-13, column 6 would extend 3 cells in each direction.\n\nBut how this looks in the output is unclear. Given the complexity, I'll proceed to format the output based on these assumptions, expanding each cell's value into a cross of length equal to the value.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to figure out the transformation pattern from the input to the output in the training examples and then apply it to the test input. Let me start by carefully examining each example to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\nThe input has some 3s and 4s. The output seems to expand those numbers into larger blocks. For instance, the 3 in the second row is surrounded by more 3s in the output. Similarly, the 4s in the lower rows spread out. Also, the 1s in the input's third row are retained, but the 4s around them in the output form a sort of diamond shape. Maybe there's a kernel or a shape being applied around each non-zero number.\n\nExample 1:\nHere, there's an 8 and a 2. In the output, the 8s form a vertical line, and the 6s spread around. The 2 and 3 in the lower part expand into a horizontal line. It looks like each number is being expanded into a cross shape or some directional pattern. The 8s become a vertical column, 6s a horizontal row, and the 2 and 3 form a horizontal line. So maybe each number has a specific direction (like up, down, left, right) and when transformed, they spread in that direction.\n\nExample 2:\nThe input has 8s and 4s arranged in blocks. The output shows those blocks expanding into larger squares. The 8s form a 3x3 square, then the 4s are in the center. It seems like the numbers are expanding outward, creating a larger square with the same number, but when they overlap, the higher number takes precedence. Or perhaps there's a dilation effect where each cell is replaced by a certain shape, like a 3x3 square, and the numbers are filled in.\n\nExample 3:\nThe input has 3s and 2s. In the output, the 3s form a small cross (maybe up, down, left, right), and the 4s spread into a horizontal line. The 2s and 4s in the lower part expand into horizontal lines. It seems like each number might have a specific direction or a way to spread. For example, the number 3 could spread upwards and downwards, while 4 spreads horizontally.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern might involve each non-zero number expanding in a certain direction or shape. For example, numbers could spread to adjacent cells in specific directions based on their value. Alternatively, each number might represent a direction (like 8 is up, 4 is left, 6 is right, 2 is down, etc.), and the output shows the area covered by those directions.\n\nWait, looking back at Example 0: The 3 in the input is surrounded by 3s forming a cross (up, down, left, right). The 4s in the lower part form a horizontal line. The 1s are retained. So maybe each number corresponds to a direction. For instance:\n- 3 could be vertical (up and down)\n- 4 could be horizontal (left and right)\n- 1 might stay the same, or perhaps act as a center.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 in the input expands vertically (like a column), and 6 (maybe right?) expands horizontally. The 2 and 3 form a horizontal line. Hmm, but 2 in some examples (like Example 3) seems to be part of a horizontal line. Maybe numbers have different directions assigned.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the transformation is similar to a cellular automaton where each non-zero cell spreads its value to neighboring cells according to specific rules. For example, each non-zero cell might spread to all adjacent cells (including diagonally?), creating a larger block. But in Example 2, the 8s form a 3x3 block. The input had three rows of 8s, and in the output, they expanded into 3x9 blocks. Wait, in Example 2's input, there are 3 rows of 8s in columns 9-11. The output has those expanded into 3 rows of 8s covering columns 6-14. So each 8 cell is creating a 3x3 square around it. Then, the 4s in the input (columns 9-11, rows 10-12) become a 3x3 square but replaced by 4s where possible. However, in the output, the 4s are in the center of the 8s' expansion. So perhaps the spread is a 3x3 square around each cell, and the highest number takes precedence.\n\nWait, in Example 2's output, the 8s form a large block, but the 4s are in the middle. The input's 8s are in rows 7-9, columns 9-11. The output's 8s are in rows 7-9, columns 6-14 (expanding 3 cells left and right). Then, the 4s in rows 10-12, columns 9-11 expand into 3x3, but the output shows them surrounded by 8s. So maybe the 8s are processed first, expanding into their 3x3 areas, then the 4s expand into their 3x3, but overlapping with 8's area. But since 4 is lower than 8, the 8s remain. Wait, but in Example 2's output, the 4s are in the center of the 8s. So the expansion is per cell, and when multiple expansions overlap, the higher number takes precedence. So each non-zero cell in the input generates a 3x3 square of the same number in the output, but if two expansions overlap, the higher number stays.\n\nBut let's check Example 0. The input has a 3 in row 2, column 3. The output has that 3 expanded into a cross (maybe a 3x3 cross without the corners). Wait, in the output, row 2, columns 2-4 are 3,3,3. Then row 1, column 3 is 3. Row 3, column 3 is 3. So that's a vertical line of 3s. But the original 3 was at row 2, column 3, and the output adds cells above and below. Then the 4s in the input (rows 9-10, columns 5-6) in the output become 4s spread to the left and right. Wait, in the input, the 4s are in rows 9-10, columns 5-6. The output shows in rows 9-10, columns 3-8 (so expanding two cells left and right). So maybe each non-zero cell spreads two cells in all directions (left, right, up, down), creating a cross of 5 cells (original plus two in each direction). But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is a diamond shape. For example, a cell with value N spreads to cells at a Manhattan distance of 1 or 2. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number represents a certain radius of expansion. For example, a 3 might spread 3 cells in a certain direction. Wait, but that might not fit.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output: The input has a 3 and 2 in row 2, columns 4 and 5. The output transforms the 3 into a vertical line (rows 1-3, column 5) and the 2 remains. Then, later in the input, there's a 4 and 2 in rows 7-10. The output has 4s spreading into horizontal lines. So maybe 3 is vertical spread, 4 is horizontal spread, 2 is something else. Maybe each number corresponds to a direction:\n\n- 3: vertical (up and down)\n- 4: horizontal (left and right)\n- 2: maybe diagonal?\nBut in Example 1, the 2 is part of a horizontal line. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are part of a directional code, where each digit represents a direction. For example:\n\n- 8 could be up\n- 2 could be down\n- 4 left\n- 6 right\n- 3 up and down\n- 1 is a center\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the cells that change from input to output. For each non-zero cell in the input, the output has a pattern around it. For instance, in Example 0, the 3 in the input (row 1, column 3) becomes a vertical line of 3s in the output (rows 0-3, column 3). Wait, no. Wait, in the input of Example 0, the 3 is in row 1 (0-based?), but the output has 3s in rows 1, 2, 3 (columns 3), forming a vertical line. Wait, maybe the expansion is two cells up and down. Let me check the rows:\n\nInput Example 0's input rows (assuming 0-based):\n\nRow 1 (second line) has a 3 at column 3.\n\nIn the output, the 3 is in rows 1, 2, 3 (columns 3), making a vertical line of three 3s. So the original 3 is in row 1, and it spreads down to rows 2 and 3? Similarly, the 4s in rows 9 and 10 (input) spread to columns 3-8, rows 9-10 in the output. So maybe each non-zero cell spreads two cells to the left and right, but vertically for some numbers and horizontally for others.\n\nAlternatively, the spread depends on the number. For example, 3 is vertical spread (two cells up and down), 4 is horizontal spread (two cells left and right), 8 is vertical spread, etc.\n\nIn Example 1's input, there's an 8 in row 1, column 5. The output shows a vertical line of 8s in column 5, rows 1-3. Similarly, the 6 in row 7, column 11 spreads to a horizontal line (columns 11-13, row 7). The 2 in row 2, column 2 becomes part of a horizontal line (columns 0-5? Not exactly. Wait, in the output, the 2 is in row 12, columns 5-7 (maybe).\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to find a pattern for each number:\n\nFor Example 0:\n\n- The 3 in row 1, column 3 becomes a vertical line (rows 1-3, column 3).\n- The 4s in rows 9-10, columns 5-6 become horizontal lines (columns 3-8 in rows 9-10).\n\nSo 3 is vertical, 4 is horizontal. Then, in the output, 3's are vertical lines, 4's are horizontal lines.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\n- The 8 in row 1, column 5 becomes a vertical line (column 5, rows 1-3).\n- The 6 in row 7, column 11 becomes a horizontal line (row 7, columns 11-13).\n- The 2 in row 12, column 5 becomes a horizontal line (row 12, columns 5-7).\n- The 3 in row 12, column 6 becomes a horizontal line (row 12, columns 5-8?).\n\nSo 8 is vertical, 6 is horizontal, 2 and 3 are horizontal.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\n- The 3 in row 2, column 5 (input) becomes a vertical line (rows 1-3, column 5).\n- The 4 in rows 9-10, columns 6-7 (input) becomes horizontal lines (columns 2-5 in rows 9-10).\n\nSo again, 3 is vertical, 4 is horizontal.\n\nSo maybe the rule is:\n\n- Numbers 3, 8 are vertical: they spread two cells up and down.\n- Numbers 4, 6, 2 are horizontal: they spread two cells left and right.\n- Number 1 remains as is.\n\nBut why in Example 1, the 2 and 3 are part of a horizontal line. The 2 in input is at row 2, column 2. The output has a horizontal line in row 12, columns 5-7 for 2. Wait, that might be a different context. Maybe the number's value determines the direction of spread. For example:\n\n- 2: right\n- 3: up\n- 4: left\n- 6: right\n- 8: down\n\nBut that seems inconsistent. Alternatively, the number represents the direction as per the numpad:\n\nOn a numpad, 8 is up, 2 is down, 4 is left, 6 is right. So:\n\n- 8: up\n- 2: down\n- 4: left\n- 6: right\n- 3: up-right\n- 1: down-left\nBut this might not fit. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the 3's spread vertically. If 3 is up-right, but in the example, the spread is vertical. Hmm. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers 3 and 8 are vertical, 4 and 6 are horizontal. So:\n\n- 3: vertical (up and down)\n- 8: vertical\n- 4: horizontal (left and right)\n- 6: horizontal\n- 2: maybe down, but in Example 1, the 2 is part of a horizontal spread. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the number's parity determines direction. Even numbers are horizontal (4,6,8), odd numbers are vertical (3,1). But in Example 0, 1 is part of the original and remains. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Each non-zero cell in the input creates a line or area in the output. The length of the line depends on the number. For example, a 3 creates a line of length 3 (original plus two more). But in Example 0, the 3 in row 1, column 3 becomes three cells vertically (rows 1,2,3), which is three cells. Similarly, the 4s in rows 9-10, columns 5-6 become four cells horizontally (columns 3-6?), but in the output, they are columns 3-8. Wait, that's six cells. Hmm. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, each number represents the number of cells to spread in each direction. For example, 3 means spread 3 cells in all directions. But that would create a larger area. In Example 0, the 3 in row 1, column 3 would spread 3 cells up, down, left, right. But the output shows a vertical line, not a square. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the number is the direction code, and the spread is in that direction. Like 8 is up, so the cell and two above. 4 is left, so the cell and two to the left. 6 is right, cell and two to the right. 2 is down, cell and two below. 3 could be up and down (two cells each way?), making a vertical line of five cells. But in Example 0, the 3 is in row 1 (assuming 0-based) and spreads to rows 1,2,3. That's three cells. So maybe it's spread one cell up and down. Then, 3 (for vertical) would spread one up and one down. So for a cell with number N, spread in direction(s) based on N, for a certain distance.\n\nIn Example 0's 3: spread up one and down one, making a vertical line of three cells.\n\nFor 4: spread left one and right one, making a horizontal line of three cells.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the 4s are spread more than that. Wait, the input has 4s in columns 5-6, rows 9-10. The output has them spread to columns 3-8 in rows 9-10, which is six columns. That's more than three cells. So maybe each 4 spreads two cells left and right. So, for example, 4 spreads two cells left and two right, making a horizontal line of five cells. But in the output, the 4s are from column 3 to 8 (six cells). Wait, that's six cells. Original 4s are in columns 5-6. If spread two left and two right, columns 3-8. That's six cells. So yes, two in each direction. So the spread is two cells in the direction determined by the number.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\nEach non-zero cell in the input spreads two cells in the direction corresponding to its number. For example:\n\n- 8: up (spread two cells above)\n- 2: down (two cells below)\n- 4: left (two cells to the left)\n- 6: right (two cells to the right)\n- 3: up and down (spread one up and one down, making three cells vertical)\nWait, but in Example 0, 3 is spread to three cells vertically. So perhaps 3 spreads one up and one down. Similarly, 1 might not spread.\n\nBut then how to explain Example 3's output. The input has a 3 in row 2, column 5 (assuming rows are 0-based). The output in Example 3's row 1 (0-based?) has a 3 in column 5. The original row 2's 3 is there, and row 3's 3. So three cells vertically. So that's one up and one down.\n\nSimilarly, the 4 in Example 3's input (rows 7-8, columns 6-7) in the output spread two cells left and right. So columns 4-9 (assuming original columns 6-7). So each 4 cell spreads two left and two right. Wait, the original 4 is in column 6. Spreading two left (6-2=4) and two right (6+2=8). So from 4 to 8. That's five cells (4,5,6,7,8). But in the output of Example 3, the 4s in rows 9-10 are spread into columns 2-5. Let's see:\n\nInput Example 3 has 4s in rows 7-8, columns 6-7. In the output, rows 9-10, columns 2-5. Wait, that's a different position. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the row indexing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number's direction is as per the numpad:\n\n- 8: up\n- 2: down\n- 4: left\n- 6: right\n- 3: up and right\n- 1: down and left\n- 7: up and left\n- 9: up and right\n\nBut this might complicate things. Alternatively, numbers 3 and 8 are vertical, 4 and 6 are horizontal, and others like 2 might be down.\n\nWait, but in Example 1's input, the 2 is part of a horizontal line in the output. Maybe the direction is not strictly per number but based on another factor.\n\nAlternatively, the number determines the length of the spread. For example, a 3 means spread three cells in a certain direction. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to apply the possible rule to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nLooking at the test input, there are several non-zero cells:\n\nRow 2: 8,8 at columns 4-5.\n\nRow 3: 8,1,8 at columns 3-5. Also, 4,4,4 starting at column 10, rows 3-5. And 1,1,1 at columns 13-15.\n\nRow 4: 8,8 at columns 3-4.\n\nRows 7-10, columns 22-25: 1s and 2s.\n\nRows 10-11, columns 6-7: 1s.\n\nRows 12-13, columns 6-7: 3s.\n\nAssuming the rule is that each number spreads two cells in their respective directions:\n\nFor 8: spread two cells up and down (vertical). So each 8 would create a vertical line of five cells (original + two up and two down).\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the 3 spread to three cells (original plus two). So maybe two cells in one direction for some numbers.\n\nAlternatively, for 8: spread two cells up. For 4: spread two cells left. For 2: spread two cells down. For 3: spread two cells right. Wait, but how does that fit with previous examples.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of each number as a direction code (like 8 is up, 4 is left, 6 is right, 2 is down). So when a cell has a number, it spreads in that direction for two cells.\n\nFor example, in Example 0, the 3 is vertical. Maybe 3 is up and down. So each 3 cell spreads two cells up and two down. But in Example 0's output, the 3 in row 1, column 3 spreads to row 1-3, column 3. That's three cells. So two cells down. But maybe it's two cells in the direction. For 8 (up), spread two cells up. For 3, maybe it's up and down, but only one cell each way.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to apply this to the test input.\n\nTest Input has 8s in rows 2-4, columns 4-5. Let's focus on the 8s first.\n\nIf 8 is up, then each 8 in the input would spread two cells up. But the original cell is in row 2 (assuming 0-based). Spreading two up would take it to rows 0-2. But the original 8 is in row 2, so spreading two up would be row 0 and 1. But in the input, the 8s are in row 2 and 3. Wait, maybe the rows are 0-based, so the first line is row 0.\n\nWait, in the test input:\n\nThe first line is row 0.\n\nRow 2 (third line) has 8,8 at columns 4-5.\n\nRow 3 (fourth line) has 8 at column 3 and 5 (with a 1 in column 4).\n\nRow 4 has 8,8 at columns 3-4.\n\nSo for each 8, which is direction up, the cell would spread two cells up.\n\nBut if an 8 is in row 3, column 3, spreading up two cells would affect rows 1, 2, 3 (the original cell and two up). So in the output, those cells would become 8.\n\nSimilarly, the 4s in row 3-5, columns 10-12 (input) are 4s. If 4 is left, each 4 would spread two cells to the left. So columns 8-12 for each 4.\n\nThe 1s in row 3-5, columns 13-15: 1 is maybe not spreading, so they remain.\n\nThen, in rows 7-10, columns 22-25: there are 1s and 2s. If 2 is down, then each 2 would spread two cells down. So from row 7, column 22-25, the 2s would spread to rows 7,8,9.\n\nRows 10-11, columns 6-7: 1s. No spread.\n\nRows 12-13, columns 6-7: 3s. If 3 is up and down, spread two cells in both directions. So rows 10-14, columns 6-7 for the 3s.\n\nPutting this together, the output would have:\n\nFor each 8 in the input, spread two up. So:\n\n- Row 2, columns 4-5 (8s) spread up to rows 0-2, columns 4-5. But wait, original row 2, spreading two up would be rows 0,1,2. So those cells become 8.\n\nRow 3, columns 3 and 5: 8s. Spread two up. So row 1-3 for column 3 and 5.\n\nRow 4, columns 3-4: 8s. Spread two up: rows 2-4.\n\nFor 4s in rows 3-5, columns 10-12: spread two left. Columns 8-12. So those rows 3-5, columns 8-12 would be 4s.\n\nThe 1s remain as is.\n\nFor 2s in rows 7-10, columns 26-29 (assuming columns 26-29 are the 2s in input rows 7-10): each 2 spreads two down. So rows 7-12 for those columns.\n\nThe 3s in rows 12-13, columns 6-7 spread two up and down. So rows 10-14, columns 6-7.\n\nBut need to check for overlapping and higher numbers. For example, if an 8 and a 4 overlap, the higher number (8) would take precedence.\n\nPutting this all together, the test output would have:\n\n- Vertical lines of 8s where the input 8s were, spreading two up.\n\n- Horizontal lines of 4s spreading two left from the input 4s.\n\n- Vertical lines of 3s spreading two up and down.\n\n- The 2s spreading two down.\n\nBut need to visualize this properly.\n\nHowever, given the complexity, perhaps the best way is to apply the rule where each non-zero cell spreads two cells in the direction corresponding to their number (8 up, 2 down, 4 left, 6 right, 3 up and down, etc.) and higher numbers override lower ones.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nThe 8s in the input will create vertical lines two cells up.\n\nThe 4s will create horizontal lines two cells left.\n\nThe 2s will create vertical lines two cells down.\n\nThe 3s will create vertical lines two cells up and down.\n\nThe 1s remain as is.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nIn rows 0-4, columns 3-5: 8s from the original 8s spreading up.\n\nThe 4s in rows 3-5, columns 10-12 would spread left to columns 8-12.\n\nThe 2s in rows 7-10, columns 26-29 will spread down to rows 9-11.\n\nThe 3s in rows 12-13, columns 6-7 will spread up and down to rows 10-14.\n\nAlso, the 1s in the input's row 3, column 4 and others may be overwritten by higher numbers.\n\nPutting it all together, the output would have various vertical and horizontal lines based on the spread directions.\n\nBut given the complexity, the final answer should look like the examples, with each number's spread forming lines in their respective directions, and overlapping areas taking the highest number.",
