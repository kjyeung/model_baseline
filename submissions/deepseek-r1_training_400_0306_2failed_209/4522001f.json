        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by carefully analyzing the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input is a 3x3 matrix:\n\n3 3 0\n3 2 0\n0 0 0\n\nThe output is a 9x9 matrix. Wait, how does a 3x3 input become a 9x9 output? Let me check the dimensions. 3x3 input leading to 9x9 output. Hmm, maybe each element in the input is expanded into a 3x3 block in the output? Let me see.\n\nThe output for Example 0 has 9 rows and 9 columns. Let's break it down. The input has elements 3, 3, 0 in the first row. The output's first four rows are [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0], repeated four times. Then the next four rows start with 0s and then 3s. Wait, maybe each number in the input is being scaled up by a factor of 3? But the output is 9x9, which is 3 times the original 3x3. Wait, 3x3 input to 9x9 output would mean each element is replaced by a 3x3 block. But in Example 0, the output has four rows of [3,3,3,3,0,...], which is 4 rows, then another four rows with 0s and 3s. Wait, maybe there's a different pattern here.\n\nLet me think again. Let's look at the input of Example 0. The input has a 3 at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and a 2 at (1,1). The output is a larger matrix where maybe each original number is replaced by a block based on the number's value. For example, the 3s and 2 in the input might determine the size or pattern of the blocks in the output.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 0, the first four rows have four 3s followed by five 0s. Then rows 4-7 (the fifth to eighth rows) start with four 0s, then four 3s, then a 0. The last row is all zeros. So the output seems to be divided into sections. Let me count. The output is 9x9, so perhaps each original row is expanded into three rows in the output, but with some transformation.\n\nWait, maybe each element in the input matrix is transformed into a 3x3 block in the output, but the transformation depends on the value of the element. Let's check. The input's (0,0) is 3. In the output, the top-left 3x3 block (but looking at the first few rows, maybe it's 3x3 but scaled up in some way). Alternatively, perhaps the numbers 0, 2, 3 in the input determine how many 3s or 0s are in the corresponding block in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value in the input cell indicates the number of times a certain pattern is repeated. For instance, a 3 might correspond to a 4x4 block (but 4 rows?), but that's conflicting because the output is 9x9. Let me try to see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row is [3,3,0]. The output's first four rows are all [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]. So four rows of 3s followed by 0s. Then the next four rows (rows 4-7) start with 0s, then 3s, then 0. The last row is all zeros. So perhaps each element in the input determines a 3x3 block in the output, but the way it's filled depends on the value.\n\nWait, the input has 3s, a 2, and 0s. Let's see: the first row of the input is [3,3,0]. The output's first four rows (0-3) have 4 3s followed by 5 0s. Then the next four rows (4-7) have 4 0s, then 4 3s, then 1 0. The last row (8) is all 0s. Hmm. So perhaps each element in the input is transformed into a 3x3 block in the output, but the number in the input cell determines how many rows and columns of 3s are present in that block. Wait, for example, the input cell (0,0) is 3. The corresponding block in the output's top-left is 4 rows and 4 columns of 3s. But how does 3 translate to 4? Maybe the value plus 1? Because 3 +1 =4. Then the 2 in the input (1,1) would become 3 rows and columns. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the center cell (1,1) is 2. The output's middle block (rows 4-7, columns 4-7) would be 3 rows of 3s. Wait, looking at the output, rows 4-7 (indices 4,5,6,7) and columns 4-7: each of these rows has 3,3,3,3 in positions 4-7 (but wait, in the output's rows 4-7, the 5th element is 3,3,3,3 followed by 0s. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me index the output rows and columns properly.\n\nFor Example 0's output:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0] (columns 0-8)\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: same\nRow 3: same\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0]\nRow 5: same as row 4\nRow 6: same\nRow 7: same\nRow 8: all zeros.\n\nSo each original cell is being transformed into a 3x3 block? Wait, 3x3 input becomes 9x9 output. So each input cell is 3x3 in the output. Let's see:\n\nOriginal cell (0,0) is 3. The corresponding output block is rows 0-2 and columns 0-2? But in the output, the first four rows are all 3s in the first four columns. Wait, that's 4 rows. Hmm, maybe each input cell is mapped to a 3x3 block, but with some expansion based on the value. Alternatively, maybe the input matrix is scaled up by a factor of 3, and each cell's value determines the pattern in the 3x3 block.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value in the input cell determines how many rows and columns in the output block are filled with 3s. For example, a value of 3 would result in 4 rows and 4 columns (since 3+1=4?), but how does that fit into a 9x9 grid.\n\nWait, the output is 9x9. So each input cell is a 3x3 block in the output. Let's split the output into 3x3 blocks. For Example 0, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 0\n\nRow 1:3 2 0\n\nRow 2:0 0 0\n\nThe output would then have 3x3 blocks, each of size 3x3. So the entire output is 9x9. Let me see how the output is structured.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe first four rows have 3s in the first four columns. Wait, but 4 columns would be beyond a 3x3 block. Hmm, maybe the blocks are overlapping or arranged differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input value determines the size of a square of 3s in the output. For example, a value of n in the input cell creates a square of 3s with side length n+1. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the first row of input has 3s. So 3+1=4. So a 4x4 square of 3s. But the output for Example 0's first four rows and four columns are filled with 3s. Then the next cell in the input (row 0, column 2) is 0, which would create a 1x1 (0+1) square of 0s? Not sure. Wait, but the output has 0s in those regions. Alternatively, maybe the value determines the size of the 3s square, and the rest is filled with 0s.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the first four rows are four 3s followed by five 0s, and these four rows repeat four times. Then in rows 4-7, it's 0s followed by four 3s. Wait, perhaps the input cell (i,j) affects the corresponding quadrant in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is used to create a larger grid where each number is replaced by a block whose size depends on the number. For example, a 3 in the input becomes a 4x4 block of 3s, a 2 becomes a 3x3 block, and a 0 becomes a 1x1 block (but that may not fit into the 9x9 grid). Wait, but 3x3 input with each cell as a 3x3 block would give 9x9 output. So each input cell's value determines what's in its 3x3 block in the output.\n\nSo for example, the input cell (0,0) is 3. The corresponding 3x3 block in the output could be all 3s. But looking at Example 0's output, the first three rows and columns are 3s? Wait, no. The first four rows of the output have 3s in the first four columns, but that's not 3x3. Hmm, perhaps that's not the pattern.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 1's input and output to see if that helps.\n\nExample 1's input is:\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 2 3\n\n0 3 3\n\nThe output is a 9x9 matrix. The first row is all zeros. Then rows 1-4 are [0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0], repeated four times. Then rows 5-8 have 0s followed by 3s. The last row is all zeros.\n\nWait, perhaps the value in the input cell determines the number of 3s in some direction. For example, in Example 1's input cell (1,2) is 3. The output has 3+1=4 rows or columns of 3s. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, the value in the input cell (i,j) determines the size of a square in the output. For example, a 3 would create a 4x4 square of 3s, and a 2 would create a 3x3 square. Then the position in the input determines where the square starts in the output.\n\nBut how? Let's see. For Example 0's input cell (0,0) is 3. Then in the output, a 4x4 square of 3s starts at (0,0). Then cell (0,1) is also 3, so another 4x4 square starting at (0,3) perhaps? Because 0+4=4, but in the output, the first four columns are 3s. Wait, maybe overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, the input is a 3x3 grid where each cell's value n creates a (n+1)x(n+1) square in the output. The positions of these squares are such that they start at (i*3, j*3) in the output, since each input cell is scaled by 3. Wait, but that would mean each input cell corresponds to a 3x3 block in the output. So, for example, input cell (0,0) would be the top-left 3x3 block of the output. Then, within that block, the value determines how much is filled with 3s. If the value is 3, then a (3+1)x(3+1) square, but since the block is only 3x3, maybe it's clipped. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the value indicates how many cells in the block are filled with 3s. For instance, a value of 3 in the input cell means that the 3x3 block has 3 rows filled with 3s. Let's check Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0, input cell (0,0) is 3. The corresponding 3x3 block in the output's top-left corner would have 3 rows of 3s. Looking at Example 0's output, the first four rows (0-3) are all 3s in the first four columns. Wait, but the first 3x3 block would be rows 0-2 and columns 0-2. But in the output, rows 0-3 have 3s in columns 0-3. That's four rows and four columns, which is more than 3x3. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's see the output matrices for both examples. In Example 0's output, the first four rows are filled with 3s in the first four columns. Then, starting at row 4, there's a 4x4 block of 3s shifted to columns 4-7. The last row is all zeros. Similarly, in Example 1's output, there are two main 4x4 blocks of 3s. One starts at row 1, column 1, and another starts at row 5, column 5. The rest are zeros. \n\nLooking at the input matrices:\n\nExample 0's input has 3s at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and 2 at (1,1). The output seems to have two 4x4 blocks of 3s. The first in the top-left quadrant, and another in the middle. Wait, perhaps each non-zero value in the input contributes a square in the output. For example, 3s create 4x4 blocks, and 2 creates a 3x3 block. But how are their positions determined?\n\nAlternatively, the input matrix is transformed into a larger matrix where each element is replicated in a certain way. For example, each row in the input is transformed into multiple rows in the output, possibly based on the value in that row. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the output matrices seem to have two large squares of 3s. For Example 0, the output has two 4x4 squares: one in the top-left (rows 0-3, columns 0-3) and another starting at row 4, column 4. But in the output, the second square is four rows (4-7) and four columns (4-7), filled with 3s, but the output rows 4-7 have 0s in the first four columns, then 3s. So maybe the squares are placed at certain positions, and their sizes depend on the input values.\n\nWait, maybe the input is a kind of adjacency matrix or represents some connectivity. For example, the 3s and 2s could represent distances or layers, and the output is expanding those into layers. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as a grid where each cell's value indicates the radius or extent of 3s spreading out from that position. For example, a 3 in the input means that in the output, a 3x3 area around that position is filled with 3s, but scaled up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is used to determine the number of times certain patterns are repeated. For example, each row in the input is expanded into three rows in the output, with elements repeated thrice. But looking at the output, the rows are longer than that.\n\nWait, let's count the output rows and columns. The output is 9x9. The input is 3x3. So each input element corresponds to a 3x3 block in the output. Let's map each input element to its corresponding output block.\n\nFor Example 0, input cell (0,0) is 3. The output's top-left 3x3 block (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) would be filled based on 3. But looking at the actual output, rows 0-3 (four rows) have 3s in columns 0-3 (four columns). So it's larger than 3x3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, each input cell's value n is converted into a (n+1)x(n+1) square in the output, placed at position (i*3, j*3). For example, input cell (0,0) with value 3 would create a 4x4 square starting at (0,0). But since each input cell is spaced every 3 rows and columns, this might cause overlapping. But in Example 0, the 4x4 squares from adjacent cells would overlap. However, the output shows distinct blocks. So perhaps the placement is such that each input cell's square starts at (i*3, j*3) and extends n+1 in both directions, but overlapping may occur.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the first 4 rows and columns are filled with 3s. If input cell (0,0) is 3, which would mean a 4x4 square starting at (0,0). Then input cell (0,1) is 3, which would start at (0,3) (since each input cell is 3 columns apart). But the output's first four rows have columns 0-3 filled with 3s. So if cell (0,0)'s square is 0-3 (rows and columns), and cell (0,1)'s square starts at column 3 (since 3*1=3?), then the squares would overlap. In the output, the first four columns are all 3s, which could be a merge of the squares from (0,0) and (0,1). But how?\n\nAlternatively, the input cell (i,j) is mapped to a square in the output starting at (i* (some number), j* (some number)). For example, each input cell is mapped to a 3x3 area in the output. So cell (0,0) covers rows 0-2 and columns 0-2. Then the value 3 in that cell determines how many rows and columns within that 3x3 block are filled with 3s. So if the value is 3, perhaps all 3 rows and columns are filled. But then in Example 0's cell (0,0), the 3x3 block would be all 3s. But looking at the output, the first four rows are all 3s in columns 0-3, which is outside of a 3x3 block. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nLet's try another approach. Let's look for the positions of the 3s in the output and see how they relate to the input.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 3s form two large squares: a 4x4 square at the top-left and another 4x4 square starting at row 4, column 4. The input has a 3 at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and a 2 at (1,1). The output's squares might be combining these. Perhaps the 3s in the input form a larger block when they are adjacent. For instance, if four 3s form a 2x2 block in the input, they create a larger block in the output. But in Example 0, the input has three 3s and a 2. The output has two 4x4 blocks. Maybe the 3s in the input are grouped in certain positions, leading to the output blocks.\n\nAlternatively, the input's non-zero elements are summed or their positions are used to determine the output's blocks. For example, the sum of the input elements (3+3+3+2+0s) is 11, but that might not be relevant.\n\nAnother thought: the output matrices resemble a larger version of the input, but with each element replaced by a block. But how? For instance, each input element n is replaced by a 3x3 block filled with n's. But in the examples, the output has 3s and 0s. Let's check. \n\nIf input cell is 3, replace it with a 3x3 block of 3s. If it's 2, replace with a 3x3 block of 2s. But the output in the examples doesn't have 2s. So that's not the case. The output only has 3s and 0s. So perhaps the input values are thresholded: if the value is >=2, it becomes 3, else 0. But Example 0's input has 2 in (1,1), and in the output, the corresponding area (rows 4-7, columns 4-7) has 3s. So that could be part of the pattern.\n\nBut then, how does the input translate to the output's structure? Let's imagine that each input cell is replaced by a 3x3 block, where if the input cell is >=2, the block is filled with 3s, otherwise 0s. But in Example 0, the input's (0,0) is 3, so a 3x3 block of 3s. Then (0,1) is 3, another block of 3s. (0,2) is 0, so 0s. Similarly for row 1: (1,0) is 3, so 3s; (1,1) is 2, so 3s; (1,2) is 0. So the output would be a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. Let's construct this.\n\nInput:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 0\n\nRow 1:3 2 0\n\nRow 2:0 0 0\n\nIf each cell is replaced by a 3x3 block of 3s (if value >=2) or 0s:\n\nThen the output would be:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 3 | 3 3 3 | 0 0 0\n\nRow 1: 3 3 3 | 3 3 3 | 0 0 0\n\nRow 2: 3 3 3 | 3 3 3 | 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 3 3 3 | 3 3 3 | 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 3 3 3 | 3 3 3 | 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 3 3 3 | 3 3 3 | 0 0 0\n\nWait, but the actual output for Example 0 is different. The actual output's first four rows have four 3s followed by five 0s. So the block approach isn't matching. Therefore, this is not the pattern.\n\nAnother angle: the output is created by expanding each row and column of the input. For example, each row in the input is repeated three times, and each element is repeated three times. But again, the output structure doesn't match.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output, the first four rows are identical, then the next four are identical, and the last row is all zeros. Each group of four rows corresponds to the input rows. For example, input row 0 has [3,3,0]. The output's first four rows correspond to this row. Input row 1 has [3,2,0], which is transformed into the next four rows. Input row 2 ([0,0,0]) becomes the last row (all zeros). But the output has nine rows, not three groups. Wait, four rows for input row 0, four for row 1, and one for row 2. That sums to 9 rows. Hmm, maybe each input row is expanded into (value +1) rows. Wait, but input row 0 sums to 3+3+0=6, which doesn't align. Alternatively, the maximum value in the row determines the number of rows. For example, row 0's max is 3, so 3+1=4 rows. Row 1's max is 3 (since 3 and 2 are present?), so also 4 rows. Row 2's max is 0, so 0+1=1 row. That totals 4+4+1=9 rows, which matches the output's row count. Similarly, columns might be determined by the max value in the column of the input.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input columns:\n\nColumn 0: 3,3,0 \u2192 max 3 \u2192 4 columns.\n\nColumn 1:3,2,0 \u2192 max 3 \u21924 columns.\n\nColumn 2:0,0,0 \u2192 max 0 \u21921 column.\n\nSo total columns would be 4+4+1=9, which matches the output's columns. So the pattern could be:\n\nFor each row in the input, the number of rows in the output is (max value in that row) +1.\n\nSimilarly, for each column in the input, the number of columns in the output is (max value in that column) +1.\n\nThen, the output matrix is formed by expanding each input cell (i,j) into a block of size (row_expansion) x (column_expansion), filled with 3s if the input cell's value is \u22652, otherwise 0s. Wait, but in Example 0, the output has 3s and 0s. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,0] \u2192 max is 3 \u2192 row expansion is 3+1=4 rows.\n\nRow 1: [3,2,0] \u2192 max is 3 \u2192 4 rows.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0] \u2192 max is 0 \u2192 1 row.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0: 3,3,0 \u2192 max 3 \u2192 column expansion 4.\n\nColumn 1:3,2,0 \u2192 max 3 \u21924.\n\nColumn 2:0,0,0 \u2192 max 0 \u21921.\n\nSo the output is structured as follows:\n\nEach cell (i,j) in the input is expanded into a block of (row_expansion_i) rows and (column_expansion_j) columns. The value in this block is 3 if the input cell's value is \u22652, else 0.\n\nLet's apply this to Example 0:\n\nInput cell (0,0) is 3 (\u22652). It's expanded into 4 rows (from row_expansion_i=4) and 4 columns (column_expansion_j=4). So a 4x4 block of 3s. \n\nInput cell (0,1) is 3 \u2192 4x4 block of 3s.\n\nInput cell (0,2) is 0 \u2192 4x1 block of 0s.\n\nSimilarly, row 0 in input contributes 4 rows in output. Each of these rows has:\n\n[ block (0,0):4 columns of 3s, block (0,1):4 columns of 3s, block (0,2):1 column of 0s ]\n\nSo each row in row 0's expansion would have 4+4+1=9 columns: 3s, 3s, 0s as per blocks.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the first four rows are [3,3,3,3, 0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, that's four 3s followed by five 0s. But according to the above pattern, cell (0,0) is a 4x4 block, cell (0,1) is 4x4, and cell (0,2) is 4x1. So for row 0's expansion, the columns would be 4 (from 0,0) +4 (0,1) +1 (0,2) =9. So each of the four rows in row 0's expansion would be 3s in the first 8 columns (4+4) and 0 in the last column? But in Example 0's output, the first four rows have four 3s and five 0s. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the columns expand.\n\nWait, column expansion is based on the input's column max. For example, column 0 has max 3 \u2192 4 columns. So each cell in column 0 of the input will be expanded into 4 columns in the output. Similarly, column 1: 4 columns, column 2: 1 column.\n\nSo for input cell (0,0) which is in column 0, it's expanded into 4 columns. So cell (0,0) is 3 \u2192 4 columns of 3s. Cell (0,1) is in column 1 \u2192 4 columns of 3s. Cell (0,2) is in column 2 \u2192 1 column of 0s.\n\nSo row 0 of the input is expanded into 4 rows (due to row expansion of 4). Each of these rows in the output has 4 (from column 0) +4 (column 1) +1 (column 2) =9 columns. So for each of the four rows in row 0's expansion, the columns are filled as 4 3s, 4 3s, 1 0 \u2192 total 9. But in Example 0's output, the first four rows have four 3s followed by five 0s, which suggests that the columns after the first four are zeros. So this contradicts the pattern I thought.\n\nWait, perhaps the column expansion is applied per-cell. For example, each cell's column expansion is determined by the input cell's value, not the column's max. That might make more sense.\n\nWait, let's re-examine. In Example 0's input, the output's first four rows have four 3s followed by five 0s. So maybe each cell's column expansion is determined by the cell's value. For example, a cell with value n is expanded into n+1 columns. So in Example 0, cell (0,0) is 3 \u2192 4 columns. Cell (0,1) is 3 \u21924 columns. Cell (0,2) is 0 \u21921 column. So the first row of the output's expansion would have 4+4+1=9 columns, filled with 3s for the first two cells and 0 for the third. But the output has four 3s followed by five 0s, which suggests that the first two cells (3 and 3) contribute four 3s each, totaling 8, but the output has four. So this doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the row and column expansion is determined by the cell's value. For example, a cell with value n is expanded into (n+1) rows and (n+1) columns. Then, the total rows would be the sum of (n+1) for each row in the input. Similarly for columns. Let's check Example 0.\n\nInput row 0: [3,3,0] \u2192 each cell's row contribution is 4,4,1. The maximum in the row is 4 (from the first two cells). But how to sum them? Or perhaps each cell's row expansion is the cell's value +1, and the total rows for the output is the sum of all row expansions. But Example 0's output has 9 rows. Sum of row expansions for input rows:\n\nRow 0: 3+1=4, 3+1=4, 0+1=1 \u2192 sum 4+4+1=9? No, but the output has 9 rows. Wait, maybe each input row's expansion is the maximum value in that row +1. For Example 0, row 0's max is 3 \u2192 4 rows. Row 1's max is 3 \u21924 rows. Row 2's max is 0 \u21921 row. Total 4+4+1=9 rows. Yes, that matches. For columns, each input column's expansion is the max value in that column +1. For Example 0:\n\nColumn 0: max 3 \u21924 columns.\n\nColumn 1: max 3 \u21924.\n\nColumn 2: max 0 \u21921.\n\nTotal columns:4+4+1=9. Which matches the output's columns.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- The output's row count is the sum of (max value of each input row +1).\n\n- The output's column count is the sum of (max value of each input column +1).\n\n- Each input cell (i,j) with value v is expanded into a block of (max_row_i +1) rows and (max_col_j +1) columns, where max_row_i is the maximum value in input row i, and max_col_j is the maximum value in input column j. The block is filled with 3s if v >=2, else 0s.\n\nWait, but this needs to be clarified. Let's test with Example 0.\n\nExample 0's input:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,0] \u2192 max_row_0 =3 \u2192 expands into 3+1=4 rows.\n\nRow 1: [3,2,0] \u2192 max_row_1=3 \u21924 rows.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0] \u2192 max_row_2=0 \u21921 row.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0:3,3,0 \u2192 max_col_0=3 \u21924 columns.\n\nColumn 1:3,2,0 \u2192 max_col_1=3 \u21924 columns.\n\nColumn 2:0,0,0 \u2192max_col_2=0 \u21921 column.\n\nEach cell (i,j) is expanded into a block of (max_row_i +1) rows and (max_col_j +1) columns. Wait, but max_row_i is the max of the input's row i. So for cell (0,0), which is in row 0 (max_row_0=3), the row expansion for this cell is 4 rows. The column expansion for cell (0,0) is max_col_j=3 (column 0's max is 3), so 4 columns. So the block for cell (0,0) is 4x4 filled with 3s (since value >=2).\n\nSimilarly, cell (0,1) is 3, which is in row 0 (4 rows) and column 1 (4 columns) \u2192 4x4 block of 3s.\n\nCell (0,2) is 0 \u2192 row expansion 4 rows, column expansion 1 \u2192 4x1 block of 0s.\n\nSo row 0 of the input contributes 4 rows in the output. Each of these rows is composed of the blocks from each cell in row 0 of the input. So:\n\nFor the four rows corresponding to input row 0, each row in the output will have:\n\n- 4 columns of 3s (from cell (0,0))\n\n- followed by 4 columns of 3s (from cell (0,1))\n\n- followed by 1 column of 0s (from cell (0,2)).\n\nSo each of these four rows would be: [3,3,3,3, 3,3,3,3, 0]\n\nWait, but that's 4+4+1=9 columns. But Example 0's output has rows like [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]. So the first four columns are 3s, then five 0s. That doesn't match. There's a discrepancy here. According to this pattern, the first 8 columns would be 3s and the last 0. But the example's output has four 3s followed by five 0s. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the row expansion and column expansion are based on the cell's own value, not the max of the row or column. For example, each cell with value v expands to (v+1) rows and (v+1) columns. Then, the output's dimensions would be the sum of (v+1) for each row and column. But this seems complicated. Let's check Example 0.\n\nExample 0's input is 3x3. If each cell (i,j) expands to (v+1) rows and columns:\n\nFor cell (0,0) v=3 \u21924x4.\n\nCell (0,1) v=3 \u21924x4.\n\nCell (0,2) v=0 \u21921x1.\n\nRow 0 would have the maximum row expansion of 4 (since cells (0,0) and (0,1) expand to 4 rows). So the total rows for the output would be sum of the max row expansions per input row.\n\nBut this seems complex. Let's try to apply this to Example 0.\n\nInput row 0: [3,3,0]. The row expansion for each cell is 4,4,1. So the row expansion for this input row is the maximum of 4,4,1 \u21924 rows.\n\nSimilarly, input row 1: [3,2,0] \u21924,3,1 \u21924 rows.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0] \u21921,1,1 \u21921 row.\n\nTotal output rows:4+4+1=9.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0:3,3,0 \u21924,4,1 \u2192max 4.\n\nColumn 1:3,2,0 \u21924,3,1 \u2192max 4.\n\nColumn 2:0,0,0 \u21921,1,1 \u2192max 1.\n\nTotal output columns:4+4+1=9.\n\nNow, each cell (i,j) expands to (v+1) rows and columns. Then, the output is constructed by tiling these blocks according to their row and column expansions.\n\nFor example, cell (0,0) is a 4x4 block of 3s.\n\nCell (0,1) is a 4x4 block of 3s.\n\nCell (0,2) is a 1x1 block of 0s.\n\nBut when arranging these blocks in the output, the row expansions are determined per-row (max of the cell's row expansions in that row), and similarly for columns. Then, each block is (v+1)x(v+1), but aligned in the output's grid.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the first four rows and four columns are filled with 3s. This would align with cell (0,0) and (0,1) blocks being 4x4. But how do they fit into the output? If each row's expansion is the max of the cell's row expansions in that row, and each column's expansion is the max of the cell's column expansions in that column, then the output's structure is formed by arranging the blocks accordingly.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to think differently. Looking at Example 1's input and output may help.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 2 3\n\n0 3 3\n\nThe output is 9x9. The first row is all zeros. Then rows 1-4 are [0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]. Rows 5-8 are [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3].\n\nSo the output has two 4x4 blocks of 3s. The first block starts at row 1, column 1. The second starts at row 5, column 5. \n\nLooking at the input:\n\nThe input has a 2 at (1,1) and 3s at (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). The output's blocks are at positions that could correspond to these cells. For instance, the first block (rows 1-4, columns 1-4) might correspond to input cell (1,1) with value 2. But it's a 4x4 block of 3s. The second block (rows 5-8, columns 5-8) could correspond to input cells with value 3. \n\nThis suggests that the value in the input cell determines the size of the block in the output. A value of 3 results in a 4x4 block, a value of 2 results in a 3x3 block. But in Example 1's output, the 2's block is 4x4. Hmm, so maybe the value is added by 1 to get the block size. So 3 \u21924x4, 2\u21923x3. But in Example 1's input, cell (1,1) is 2, so a 3x3 block. But in the output, there's a 4x4 block starting at row 1, column 1. That contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the value in the input cell determines the starting position of the block. For example, a value of n means the block starts at row n* something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the input cell's value indicates the number of layers or steps in the output. For instance, each non-zero cell in the input contributes a square of 3s in the output, with the side length being 2*v. But for v=3, that's 6, which doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's input, the cells with value 3 are at positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and the 2 is at (1,1). The output's blocks are in the top-left and middle, which might correspond to these positions scaled by 3. For example, input cell (0,0) would be at (0*3, 0*3) in the output, and the block size is based on the value.\n\nIf each input cell is scaled by 3, so cell (i,j) starts at (i*3, j*3) in the output. Then, the block's size is (value+1)x(value+1). So for example, input cell (0,0) with value 3 starts at (0,0) and is 4x4, covering rows 0-3 and columns 0-3. Input cell (0,1) with value 3 starts at (0,3) and is 4x4, covering rows 0-3, columns 3-6. These would overlap, but in the output, the first four rows have 3s in columns 0-3, then columns 4-7. This seems to align with Example 0's output.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the first four rows have 3s in columns 0-3, then columns 4-7 have 3s starting at row 4. That doesn't align with the idea of overlapping blocks. So perhaps the blocks are placed without overlapping. Maybe each cell's block is placed in a specific quadrant based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, each input cell's block is placed in the output such that the blocks from different cells do not overlap. For example, input cell (0,0) is placed in the top-left quadrant, cell (0,1) in the top-middle, etc. But the output's structure doesn't seem to support this.\n\nLet me try to apply this scaling idea to Example 1.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\nRow 0:0 0 0\n\nRow 1:0 2 3\n\nRow 2:0 3 3\n\nOutput: \n\nFirst row is all zeros. Then rows 1-4 have a block starting at column 1. Rows 5-8 have a block starting at column 5.\n\nIf input cell (1,1) is 2, scaled to (1*3,1*3) = (3,3) in the output. The block size is 2+1=3x3. So from row 3 to 5 (3 rows), columns 3 to 5. But in the output, the block starts at row 1, column 1, which is (0,0) scaled by 3 plus 1. Hmm, this doesn't align.\n\nAnother approach: the output is a 9x9 grid, and each input cell (i,j) is scaled to a 3x3 block starting at (3i, 3j) in the output. Then, within that 3x3 block, the number of 3s is determined by the input value. For example, a value of 3 means the entire 3x3 block is filled with 3s. A value of 2 means the first 2 rows and columns are filled with 3s. A value of 0 means all 0s.\n\nLet's test this for Example 0:\n\nInput cell (0,0) is 3 \u2192 entire 3x3 block (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) is 3s.\n\nInput cell (0,1) is 3 \u2192 block rows 0-2, columns 3-5 \u2192 3s.\n\nInput cell (0,2) is 0 \u2192 block rows 0-2, columns 6-8 \u2192 0s.\n\nInput cell (1,0) is 3 \u2192 block rows 3-5, columns 0-2 \u21923s.\n\nInput cell (1,1) is 2 \u2192 block rows 3-5, columns 3-5. Only the first 2 rows and columns filled with 3s. So rows 3-4 and columns 3-4 are 3s, the rest 0s.\n\nInput cell (1,2) is 0 \u2192 block rows 3-5, columns 6-8 \u21920s.\n\nInput cell (2,0) is 0 \u2192 block rows 6-8, columns 0-2 \u21920s.\n\nCell (2,1) \u21920 \u21920s.\n\nCell (2,2)\u21920 \u21920s.\n\nBut the actual output of Example 0 is different. The output's first four rows have 3s in the first four columns, which doesn't align with this 3x3 block approach. So this might not be the correct pattern.\n\nAt this point, I'm struggling to find the pattern. Let me recap the key observations from the examples:\n\n- The output is a 9x9 matrix for a 3x3 input.\n\n- The output consists of large blocks of 3s and 0s.\n\n- The position and size of the blocks seem to depend on the input values and their positions.\n\n- The number of rows and columns in the output is determined by the input's row and column maxima.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's output, the 3s are arranged in two 4x4 blocks. The positions of these blocks correspond to the input cells (0,0) and (1,1). The input cell (0,0) is 3, which could lead to a 4x4 block. The cell (1,1) is 2, leading to a 3x3 block, but in the output, it's a 4x4 block. Hmm, perhaps the value plus one determines the block size.\n\nWait, if a cell with value v produces a (v+1)x(v+1) block of 3s, then:\n\nExample 0's cell (0,0) is 3 \u21924x4 block.\n\nCell (1,1) is 2 \u21923x3 block.\n\nBut in the output, there are two 4x4 blocks, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the block size is (v+1) rows and (v+1) columns, but placed such that overlapping occurs.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the two 4x4 blocks are placed at positions that are not overlapping, suggesting that each block is placed in a different quadrant.\n\nAnother possibility: each input cell contributes a cross shape in the output, with the length determined by the cell's value. But I don't see how that would create the large blocks.\n\nAlternatively, the input cell's value determines the size of a square centered at a particular position in the output. For example, a value of 3 creates a 7x7 square centered in the output. But this is speculation.\n\nLet's think of the output as a larger matrix where each input cell's value determines the size of a square of 3s placed in the output. For example, a value of 3 would create a square of 3s with side length 4 (3+1), placed starting at position (i*3, j*3). But again, how this fits into the output's 9x9 grid.\n\nFor Example 0's input cell (0,0) with value 3: starts at (0,0), size 4x4. This would cover rows 0-3 and columns 0-3. Input cell (0,1) with value 3: starts at (0,3), size 4x4 \u2192 rows 0-3, columns 3-6. Overlapping with the previous block. But the output's first four rows have 3s in columns 0-3 and 4-7. Hmm, this may not align.\n\nAlternatively, the blocks are placed diagonally. For example, input cell (i,j) is placed at (i*4, j*4), leading to no overlap. But Example 0's output has blocks starting at row 0 and row 4, which are 4 rows apart. So cell (0,0) starts at 0, cell (1,1) starts at 4. So each cell's block is placed at (i*4, j*4). The size of the block is (v+1)x(v+1).\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nCell (0,0) is 3 \u21924x4 block at (0,0). Fills rows 0-3, columns 0-3.\n\nCell (1,1) is 2 \u21923x3 block at (4,4). Fills rows 4-6, columns 4-6. But the output's block starts at row 4, column 4, and is 4x4 (rows 4-7, columns 4-7). So this doesn't match.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the 3s form a larger square in the top-left and another in the middle. The input has 3s in the top-left and center. Maybe the output is created by expanding each input cell into a 3x3 block where each block's pattern is based on the cell's value.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the input cell is 3, the corresponding 3x3 block is filled with 3s.\n\n- If the input cell is 2, the center of the 3x3 block is filled with 3s.\n\n- If the input cell is 0, the block is filled with 0s.\n\nBut Example 0's input cell (1,1) is 2. Its corresponding block in the output would be a 3x3 block with the center filled. But looking at Example 0's output, the middle block (rows 4-7, columns 4-7) is 4x4 of 3s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: each input cell represents the radius of a diamond-shaped region in the output. For instance, a value of 3 creates a diamond with radius 3. But generating that in a 9x9 matrix is possible, but not sure how it fits the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a Kronecker product of the input matrix with a certain kernel. For example, each element is multiplied by a 3x3 kernel of 3s if the element is >=2, else 0s. The Kronecker product would expand each element into a 3x3 block. So for Example 0's input:\n\nThe Kronecker product would be:\n\n[3 3 0] \u2192 3*kernel, 3*kernel, 0*kernel\n\n[3 2 0] \u2192 3*kernel, 2*kernel, 0*kernel\n\n[0 0 0] \u2192 0*kernel, etc.\n\nIf the kernel is a 3x3 matrix of 1s, then the Kronecker product would give 3s where the input is 3, 2s where input is 2, etc. But the output examples only have 3s and 0s. So perhaps the kernel is 3s, and the input is thresholded: any value >=2 becomes 3, else 0. Then the Kronecker product would be:\n\nFor input cell 3 \u21923*3x3 block of 3s.\n\nInput cell 2 \u21923*3x3 block of 3s.\n\nInput cell 0 \u21920*3x3 block (all 0s).\n\nSo the output would be a 9x9 matrix where each non-zero input cell is replaced by a 3x3 block of 3s.\n\nBut let's check Example 0's input:\n\n3 3 0\n\n3 2 0\n\n0 0 0\n\nApplying this pattern, the output would have 3x3 blocks of 3s for each non-zero input cell. So for the first row of input:\n\n[3,3,0] \u2192 three 3x3 blocks: two blocks of 3s and one of 0s.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the first four rows are four 3s followed by five 0s. This doesn't match the 3x3 block idea.\n\nTherefore, this pattern is incorrect.\n\nLet's try to think of the output as a combination of expanding the input rows and columns based on their maximum values.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- Each row is expanded to (max_row_value +1) rows.\n\n- Each column is expanded to (max_column_value +1) columns.\n\nThe output is then filled such that for each cell (i,j) in the input, if the value is >=2, the corresponding expanded rows and columns in the output are filled with 3s; otherwise, 0s.\n\nFor Example 0:\n\nRows are expanded to 4,4,1.\n\nColumns are expanded to 4,4,1.\n\nSo the output has 9 rows and 9 columns.\n\nThe input's cell (0,0) is 3, which is >=2. Therefore, the corresponding expanded rows 0-3 and columns 0-3 are filled with 3s.\n\nCell (0,1) is 3 \u2192 rows 0-3, columns 4-7 (since the first column expansion is 4) \u2192 filled with 3s.\n\nCell (0,2) is 0 \u2192 rows 0-3, columns 8 \u2192 filled with 0s.\n\nCell (1,0) is 3 \u2192 rows 4-7, columns 0-3 \u2192 filled with 3s.\n\nCell (1,1) is 2 \u2192 rows 4-7, columns 4-7 \u2192 filled with 3s (since 2 >=2).\n\nCell (1,2) is 0 \u2192 rows 4-7, columns 8 \u2192 0s.\n\nCell (2,0) is 0 \u2192 row 8, columns 0-3 \u2192 0s.\n\nCell (2,1) is 0 \u2192 row 8, columns 4-7 \u2192 0s.\n\nCell (2,2) is 0 \u2192 row 8, column 8 \u21920.\n\nBut how does this filling work? For each cell (i,j) in the input, if value >=2, then all the rows and columns corresponding to that cell's expansion are filled with 3s.\n\nBut this would mean overlapping regions. For example, cell (0,0) and cell (0,1) are both 3, so their expanded columns overlap (since columns 0-3 and 4-7 are separate). So the output's first four rows would have 3s in columns 0-3 (from cell 0,0) and 4-7 (from cell 0,1), and 0s in column 8 (from cell 0,2).\n\nThis matches Example 0's output where the first four rows have four 3s followed by four 3s and then one 0. Wait, but Example 0's output first four rows are [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]. This discrepancy suggests this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, each cell (i,j) in the input contributes a rectangle in the output of size (row_expansion_i) x (column_expansion_j), filled with 3s if the cell's value >=2.\n\nSo row_expansion_i is max_row_i +1, where max_row_i is the maximum value in row i.\n\nSimilarly, column_expansion_j is max_col_j +1, where max_col_j is the maximum value in column j.\n\nSo for Example 0:\n\nEach input cell (i,j) is replaced by a block of size (4,4), (4,4), etc., based on the row and column maxima.\n\nFor cell (0,0):\n\nrow_expansion_0 =3+1=4.\n\ncolumn_expansion_0=3+1=4.\n\nSo a 4x4 block of 3s (since value is 3 >=2).\n\nCell (0,1):\n\nrow_expansion_0=4.\n\ncolumn_expansion_1=3+1=4.\n\n4x4 block of 3s.\n\nCell (0,2):\n\nrow_expansion_0=4.\n\ncolumn_expansion_2=0+1=1.\n\n4x1 block of 0s.\n\nSimilarly for other cells.\n\nThen, the output is constructed by concatenating these blocks row-wise and column-wise.\n\nSo, for each input row, the blocks are placed side by side in the output's columns, and each input row's blocks are stacked vertically in the output's rows.\n\nFor Example 0's input row 0:\n\n[3,3,0] \u2192 blocks are 4x4 (3s), 4x4 (3s), 4x1 (0s). These are placed side by side, forming a 4-row x (4+4+1=9) columns section in the output.\n\nSo the first four rows of the output would be:\n\nRows 0-3: 4 columns of 3s, 4 columns of 3s, 1 column of 0s. So each row in this section has 9 columns: 3s for the first 8, then 0. But Example 0's output for the first four rows has four 3s followed by five 0s. This doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, there must be a different pattern.\n\nLet me consider that each input cell contributes a square of 3s in the output, where the square's size is (value +1) x (value +1), and the squares are placed such that each cell's square starts at position (sum of previous row expansions, sum of previous column expansions).\n\nFor example, row expansions are determined by the max of each row. Column expansions by the max of each column.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should try to reverse-engineer the test input's expected output.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n[0, 3, 3]\n\n[0, 2, 3]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nLet's apply the pattern I think might be correct.\n\nFirst, for each row in the input, determine the row expansion (max value +1).\n\nRow 0: max is 3 \u2192 4 rows.\n\nRow 1: max is 3 \u21924 rows.\n\nRow 2: max is 0 \u21921 row.\n\nTotal rows:4+4+1=9.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0: max is 0 \u21921 column.\n\nColumn 1: max is3 \u21924 columns.\n\nColumn 2: max is3 \u21924 columns.\n\nTotal columns:1+4+4=9.\n\nNow, each cell (i,j) is expanded into a block of (row_expansion_i) rows and (column_expansion_j) columns. The block is filled with 3s if the input cell's value >=2, else 0s.\n\nSo let's process each cell:\n\nCell (0,0): value 0 \u2192 0 >=2? No. Block is 4 rows x1 column, filled with 0s.\n\nCell (0,1): value3 \u2192 >=2. Block is 4x4 filled with 3s.\n\nCell (0,2): value3 \u2192>=2. Block is 4x4 filled with 3s.\n\nRow 0's blocks: 4x1 (0s), 4x4 (3s), 4x4 (3s). When concatenated column-wise, this forms a 4-row x (1+4+4=9) columns. Each row in this section has: 0s in column 0, followed by 4 3s, then 4 3s. So each row would be [0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nCell (1,0): value 0 \u2192 block 4x1 (0s).\n\nCell (1,1): value 2 \u2192>=2. Block is 4x4 (3s).\n\nCell (1,2): value3 \u2192>=2. Block 4x4 (3s).\n\nRow 1's blocks: 4x1 (0s), 4x4 (3s), 4x4 (3s). Same as row 0's structure.\n\nRow 2's blocks: cell (2,0):0 \u21921x1 (0).\n\nCell (2,1):0 \u21921x4 (0s).\n\nCell (2,2):0 \u21921x4 (0s).\n\nSo row 2's section is 1-row x (1+4+4=9) columns: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nNow, combining all rows:\n\nRows 0-3 (from input row 0): each row is [0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nRows 4-7 (from input row 1): same as rows 0-3.\n\nRow 8 (from input row 2): all 0s.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] x4 rows (rows 0-3)\n\n[0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] x4 rows (rows 4-7)\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] x1 row (row 8)\n\nBut this doesn't match the structure of the training examples. For instance, Example 1's output has blocks in different positions. \n\nHowever, looking at the test input, the output according to this pattern would have two 4x4 blocks of 3s in columns 1-4 and 5-8, but the first column is all 0s. However, in the training examples, the outputs have more structured blocks. But according to this pattern, the test output would look like this:\n\nRow 0: [0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: same.\n\nRow 3: same.\n\nRow 4: same as row 0.\n\nRow 5: same.\n\nRow 6: same.\n\nRow 7: same.\n\nRow 8: all zeros.\n\nBut this doesn't align with the training examples. In Example 1, the output has blocks starting at different positions.\n\nThis suggests that my current hypothesis is incorrect. Perhaps the row and column expansions are determined differently. For example, row expansion is based on the cell's own value, not the row's max.\n\nAnother approach: For each input cell (i,j), the number of rows it contributes to the output is (value +1), and the number of columns is (value +1). Then, the output is constructed by placing these blocks in a grid, with each cell's block placed consecutively in rows and columns.\n\nFor example, input cell (0,0) with value 3 contributes 4 rows and 4 columns of 3s. The next cell (0,1) with value3 contributes 4 rows and 4 columns of 3s, placed next to the first block. This would make the first row of the output's rows 0-3 and columns 0-7 filled with 3s, and the last column (8) being 0 from cell (0,2). But this would require that the rows are accumulated based on the input row's cell values. However, this doesn't align with the examples.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the pattern where each input cell's value >=2 results in a block of 3s in the output, with the block size determined by the row and column expansions based on the max values in the input's rows and columns. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,3,3]\n\n[0,2,3]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\nRow expansions:\n\nRow 0: max 3 \u21924 rows.\n\nRow 1: max3 \u21924 rows.\n\nRow 2: max0 \u21921 row.\n\nColumn expansions:\n\nColumn 0: max0 \u21921 column.\n\nColumn 1: max3 \u21924 columns.\n\nColumn 2: max3 \u21924 columns.\n\nEach cell (i,j):\n\ncell (0,0):0 \u2192 4x1 block of 0s.\n\ncell (0,1):3 \u21924x4 block of 3s.\n\ncell (0,2):3 \u21924x4 block of 3s.\n\ncell (1,0):0 \u21924x1 block of 0s.\n\ncell (1,1):2 \u21924x4 block of 3s.\n\ncell (1,2):3 \u21924x4 block of 3s.\n\ncell (2,0):0 \u21921x1 block of 0.\n\ncell (2,1):0 \u21921x4 block of 0s.\n\ncell (2,2):0 \u21921x4 block of 0s.\n\nThe output will have:\n\nFor input row 0:\n\n4 rows, each consisting of:\n\n0s in column 0 (1 column), followed by 4 columns of 3s (from cell 0,1), followed by 4 columns of 3s (from cell 0,2).\n\nSo each row is [0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nFor input row 1:\n\n4 rows, each consisting of:\n\n0s in column 0, 4 columns of 3s (cell 1,1), 4 columns of 3s (cell 1,2).\n\nSame as row 0's rows.\n\nFor input row 2:\n\n1 row with:\n\n0 in column 0, 4 columns of 0s (cell 2,1), 4 columns of 0s (cell 2,2).\n\nSo the output is:\n\nRow 0-3: [0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 4-7: [0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut comparing this to the training examples, it doesn't match their structure. For example, Example 1's output has a different arrangement of blocks. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this pattern.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input 3x3 matrices into the output 9x9 matrices. Let's start by looking at the training examples to see what's going on.\n\nFirst, Example 0:\n\nInput:\n[3, 3, 0]\n[3, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput is a 9x9 matrix. Let's see how each input element maps to a block in the output. The output has 9 rows, which is 3 times the input's 3 rows. Similarly, each row in the output has 9 elements, which is 3 times the input's row length. So maybe each element in the input is expanded into a 3x3 block in the output.\n\nLooking at the first element of the input, which is 3. In the output, the first four rows are all [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]. So each 3 in the input becomes a 4x4 block of 3s followed by 5 zeros? Wait, no. Wait the output rows have 9 elements. Let me check again.\n\nWait the output for Example 0's first row is [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]. So the first four elements are 3s and then five 0s. Then the next three rows are the same. Then the next four rows start with 0s and then 3s. Wait, maybe each element in the input is being expanded into a 3x3 block, but the number of times the value is repeated depends on the input's position or value?\n\nWait, let's consider the input's structure. The input is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 9x9 grid. So each input cell becomes a 3x3 block in the output. But how?\n\nIn Example 0, the input's top-left cell is 3. In the output, the first four rows (rows 0-3) each start with four 3s followed by five 0s. Then rows 4-7 start with four 0s, then four 3s, then a 0. The last row is all 0s. Hmm, maybe the 3 in the input is split into a 4x4 block of 3s? Because 4x4 would take up 4 rows and 4 columns. Then the next element in the input row is 3 again, but perhaps overlapping or adjacent?\n\nWait, maybe each number in the input represents the size of a square block in the output. For example, if the input cell is 3, maybe that translates to a 3x3 block? But in Example 0, the input has 3 in [0][0] and [0][1], and the output seems to have a larger block. Wait, let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the first four rows have four 3s followed by 0s. Then the next four rows (4-7) start with 0s, then four 3s, then 0. The last row is all 0. Wait, perhaps each input cell is expanded into a square of size (n+1)x(n+1), where n is the input value. Because 3 would become 4x4. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first row is [3,3,0]. So the first two elements are 3 and 3, which would each become 4x4 blocks. But how are they arranged? The output's first four rows have four 3s followed by 0s. That suggests that the first 3 in the input's first row is a 4x4 block starting at (0,0), and the next 3 is another 4x4 block starting at (0,4)? Because 0+4=4. So the first 3 takes columns 0-3, the next 3 takes columns 4-7, and the third element 0 would take columns 8-8 (since 0+1=1, so 1x1? But 0 would be a single 0. So each input cell's value determines the size of a square in the output, placed next to each other.\n\nSo for the first row of the input [3,3,0], each cell is converted to a square of size (value+1)x(value+1). So 3 becomes 4x4, 0 becomes 1x1. Then arranging them horizontally, each next block starts after the previous. So the first 3 (4x4) would occupy columns 0-3, the next 3 another 4x4 at columns 4-7, and the 0 is a 1x1 at column 8. Similarly, vertically, each row of the input becomes a group of (value+1) rows in the output.\n\nWait, let's check Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0 of input: [3,3,0]. So each element in this row would generate (3+1)=4 rows in the output. But the output has 9 rows, which is 3*3=9. Wait, perhaps each input row is split into (value+1) rows, but that doesn't add up. Alternatively, each input row's elements generate blocks vertically as well. Maybe each cell in the input determines the vertical and horizontal expansion. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input cell (i,j) determines the size of a square in the output grid. For example, if the input cell is 3, then the output has a 3x3 square of 3s. But then in Example 0's output, there are larger blocks. Wait, perhaps the input cell's value determines how many times the value is repeated both in rows and columns. But in Example 0's output, the first four rows all start with four 3s. So maybe the value is repeated (value + 1) times. So 3 becomes 4 repetitions. So for each input cell, the value is repeated (value+1) times in both rows and columns.\n\nLet me test this. For Example 0's input:\n\nInput cell (0,0) is 3. So in the output, this would create a 4x4 block of 3s. Then input cell (0,1) is 3, which would create another 4x4 block next to it. Input cell (0,2) is 0, creating a 1x1 block. So the first row of the output would be the concatenation of these blocks. But since each input row is processed into a group of rows in the output, perhaps each input row's cells generate a set of rows in the output. For example, each input row becomes (max value in row +1) rows in the output? Or maybe each cell's value determines how many rows it contributes. Wait, maybe the input cell's value determines the number of rows and columns in the output for that cell. So for example, a cell with value n contributes (n+1) rows and (n+1) columns. Then the entire output is a tiling of these blocks.\n\nBut in Example 0, the input is 3x3, and the output is 9x9, which is 3x3 blocks each of size 3x3 (since 3*3=9). But that's not matching. Wait, perhaps each input cell's value is the size of the block. For example, a cell with value 3 would be a 3x3 block. Then, the output for the first input row [3,3,0] would be 3+3+0=6 columns. But the output has 9 columns. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe not that.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output again. The output has 9 rows and 9 columns. Let's see how each input cell maps to a part of the output. For instance, the first row of the input is [3,3,0]. The output's first four rows (0-3) are each starting with four 3s. Then comes four 0s. Then the fifth row starts with four 0s and then four 3s, etc. Wait, maybe the output is built by expanding each input cell into a (value + 1)x (sum of the row's values +1) or something. That seems unclear.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for the position of non-zero values in the output. In Example 0's output, the first four rows have four 3s followed by 0s, and the next four rows have 0s followed by four 3s. Wait, perhaps each input cell's value is replicated (value +1) times in both directions, but overlapping with adjacent cells. Or perhaps each input cell determines the width and height of a rectangle in the output, and the value is filled into that rectangle. For example, if an input cell has value n, then it creates a rectangle of size (n+1) x (n+1) filled with n's. But how are these arranged?\n\nLet's take Example 0's first row of input: [3,3,0]. Each cell's value is 3, 3, 0. So for the first cell (3), we would have a 4x4 block. The second cell (3) another 4x4, and the third (0) a 1x1 block. So horizontally, these would be placed next to each other. So the first 4 columns for the first cell, next 4 for the second, then 1 for the third. But 4+4+1=9 columns, which matches the output's 9 columns. Similarly, each input row is converted into (n+1) rows. So for the first input row, each cell's value is 3,3,0. The maximum value in the row is 3, so the number of rows generated would be (3+1)=4 rows. So the first input row contributes 4 rows to the output. Then the second input row is [3,2,0]. The max value here is 3 and 2, so the maximum is 3, so again 4 rows. The third input row is all 0s, so max 0, contributing 1 row. So 4+4+1=9 rows total, which matches the output's 9 rows. Wait, that seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each input row, the number of rows generated in the output is (max value in the row + 1). For each input cell in that row, the number of columns in the output is (cell value +1), and each cell's block is filled with the cell's value. Then, the blocks are arranged next to each other in the same row direction. However, each row in the input contributes (max value in the row +1) rows in the output. Wait, but how do the rows align?\n\nLet me try Example 0 again. Input row 0: [3,3,0], max is 3, so 4 rows. Each cell in this row contributes a block of (value +1) columns. So the first cell (3) contributes 4 columns of 3's. The second cell (3) also contributes 4 columns. Third cell (0) contributes 1 column. So the total is 4+4+1=9 columns. Then, for each of the 4 rows generated from this input row, the row in the output will have 4 3's, then 4 3's again? Wait no, in the output, the first four rows are [3,3,3,3, 0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, that doesn't fit. Because according to this, the first cell (3) would be 4 columns of 3's, the second cell (3) would be 4 columns of 3's, and the third cell (0) 1 column of 0's. So the output row would be 3's for 8 columns, then a 0. But in Example 0's output, the first four rows have four 3's followed by five 0's.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's see the first row of Example 0's output is [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]. So the first 4 are 3's, then 5 0's. How does this happen? The input row is [3,3,0]. So according to the cell values, each cell's block is (value+1) columns. So 3 \u21924, 3\u21924, 0\u21921. So total columns 4+4+1=9. So the first block is 4 columns of 3's, second block 4 columns of 3's, third block 1 column of 0's. So the row should be 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0. But the output has four 3's followed by five 0's. That's conflicting. So that suggests that my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So maybe the blocks are not being placed side by side. Then there's another pattern. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input, the output has a large 4x4 block of 3's in the top-left, then a 4x4 block of 3's shifted down and right. Wait, maybe the input cell's value determines the position of a square in the output. For example, the value n in cell (i,j) creates a square of size (n+1) starting at position (i*(n+1), j*(n+1))? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input cell's value represents the radius or some expansion factor. For example, a 3 could mean that the cell's value is spread out 3 units in all directions. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me look at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,2,3]\n[0,3,3]\n\nOutput:\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n[0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n[0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n[0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3]\n[0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3]\n[0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3]\n[0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3]\n\nThe output starts with a row of all 0's (from input row 0, which is all 0's). Then four rows (1-4) where the second element starts with 0 and then four 3's. Then four rows (5-8) where the fifth element starts with 0 and then four 3's. Wait, looking at the input's second row [0,2,3], the middle cell is 2 and the last is 3. The output's rows 1-4 (from input row 1) have 3's in positions 1-4, which could correspond to the cell (1,2) with value 3. Maybe the value in the input cell determines the size of a block, and the position shifts based on the cell's coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each input cell (i,j) with value n contributes a block of (n+1) x (n+1) starting at position (i*(n+1), j*(n+1)) in the output. But for Example 0, input cell (0,0) is 3, so (3+1)=4, so starts at (0,0), making a 4x4 block. Then cell (0,1) is also 3, starts at (0,4), making another 4x4. But in the output for Example 0, the first four rows have four 3's followed by four 0's and a 0. Wait, that would be 4 columns of 3's (0-3) and then 4 columns of 3's (4-7), then 1 column of 0. But in the output, after four 3's, there are five 0's. So that's 4+5=9. That doesn't match. So this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input cell's value determines the number of layers around it. For example, a value of 3 means that the cell's value is spread out 3 layers in all directions. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let's compare the input and output for Example 0:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 3,3,0\nRow 1:3,2,0\nRow 2:0,0,0\n\nOutput has a 4x4 block of 3's at the top-left, then a 4x4 block of 3's starting at column 4, row 4. Then the rest zeros. Wait, in the output, rows 0-3 are filled with four 3's and then zeros. Rows 4-7 have four 0's followed by four 3's and a 0. Row 8 is all zeros.\n\nThis seems like each input cell's value determines the distance from the top-left corner. Like, maybe the value is the number of steps from the corner, and the output is a larger grid where each cell's value is copied multiple times. Or perhaps it's a fractal pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a Kronecker product of the input matrix with a certain kernel. For example, each element is replaced by a 3x3 block. But in Example 0, the input is 3x3, output is 9x9, so that fits. Let's see. The Kronecker product (also known as tensor product) would multiply each element by a matrix. For example, if the kernel is a matrix K, then each element a_ij is replaced by a_ij * K. If the kernel is a 3x3 matrix of ones, then each element becomes a 3x3 block of itself. But the outputs in the examples are more complex than that. For instance, in Example 0, the first input row has 3,3,0. If each is a 3x3 block, the first row of the output would have three blocks: 3's, 3's, 0's. But the actual output's first row is four 3's followed by five 0's. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: Each input element is replaced by a square of size (value +1) x (value +1) filled with the value. Then, the output is formed by arranging these squares in a grid. But how are they arranged? For example, in Example 0's input, the first two elements are 3, so each becomes a 4x4 square. The third element is 0, which becomes a 1x1 square. So the first row of the input would generate a row of blocks: 4x4 (3's), 4x4 (3's), 1x1 (0). But arranging these horizontally would give 4+4+1=9 columns. Similarly, vertically, each row's height is determined by the maximum value in that row plus 1. For example, input row 0 has max value 3, so the height is 4. Input row 1 has max value 3, height 4. Input row 2 has max 0, height 1. Total rows 4+4+1=9. This seems to fit.\n\nSo here's the pattern:\n\n- For each row in the input, the height of that row in the output is (max value in the row + 1).\n\n- For each cell in the input row, the width of its block in the output is (cell value + 1).\n\n- Each cell's block is filled with the cell's value.\n\n- Blocks in the same input row are placed horizontally next to each other, and their widths add up to the total columns.\n\n- Each input row is stacked vertically, with their heights adding up to the total rows.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0:\n\nInput row 0: [3,3,0]. Max value is 3 \u2192 height 4. Each cell's width: 3+1=4, 3+1=4, 0+1=1. So the first row's output has four rows (height 4), each row being 4 (3's) +4 (3's) +1 (0) =9 columns. So each of the four rows would be 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0. But in the actual output for Example 0, the first four rows are [3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0], which is four 3's followed by five 0's. That's different. So this suggests the initial idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So why the discrepancy? In Example 0's output, the first four rows start with four 3's and then five 0's. But according to the previous logic, they should have eight 3's and one 0. That's not matching. So maybe the width is not (value +1), but something else.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output, the first four rows have four 3's, then five 0's. The four 3's could be from the first input cell (3), and the second input cell (3) might be overlapped or positioned differently. Alternatively, maybe each input cell's value determines the number of times it's replicated in both directions. For example, a cell with value n is replicated n+1 times to the right and n+1 times downward. But how?\n\nLet me think of each input cell as a starting point, and expanding to the right and downward by the value's number of times. For instance, a value of 3 would mean that the cell is replicated 3 times to the right and 3 times downward. So the block would be 4x4 (original cell plus three replications). Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first cell is 3. So it's replicated 3 times to the right and 3 times down. So starting at (0,0), expanding to (0,3) and (3,0). The block would be rows 0-3 and columns 0-3 filled with 3's. The next cell in input row 0 is also 3. So it starts at (0,4) (since the previous block ends at column 3), and expands to (0,7) and (3,7). So columns 4-7 filled with 3's. The third cell is 0, so it's just 0 at (0,8) and not replicated. Then for input row 1, which is [3,2,0], the first cell is 3, which starts at row 4 (since previous input row's block was 4 rows), expands to row 7. Columns 0-3 filled with 3's. The next cell is 2, so replicated 2 times: columns 4-6 (4,5,6) and rows 4-6. So rows 4-6 and columns 4-6 filled with 2's. The third cell is 0, so 0 at column 7. Then input row 2 is all zeros, so each cell is 0 at their positions. \n\nBut in Example 0's output, there are no 2's. So this approach might not be correct. Wait, but in the output of Example 0, there are 3's and 0's. So perhaps the 2 in the input is being replaced by 3's. Hmm, that's confusing. Looking at the input for Example 0's second row: [3,2,0]. The output's rows 4-7 have [0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0], etc. So the first four columns are 0's, then four 3's, then 0. So maybe the 2 in the input is not directly contributing. This suggests that the pattern is not based on replicating the cell's value but something else.\n\nAlternative idea: Each input cell's value indicates the size of a square block in the output, and the value of the block is determined by the input cell's value. However, overlapping blocks overwrite previous values. For example, a cell with value 3 creates a 3x3 block of 3's. But if another cell's block overlaps, it overwrites. But in Example 0's input, the cell (0,0) is 3, so a 3x3 block. Then cell (0,1) is 3, which would be next to it, but maybe the block size is larger. Wait, this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input cell's value determines the length of a cross shape in the output. For example, a value of 3 would create a cross with arms of length 3. But the output doesn't seem to have crosses.\n\nLet's take a step back. Let's look at the positions in the output where the non-zero values are present. For Example 0:\n\nThe non-zero values are in two 4x4 blocks of 3's. One in the top-left (rows 0-3, columns 0-3) and another in the middle (rows 4-7, columns 4-7). The last row is all zeros. The input for Example 0 has a 3 in (0,0), 3 in (0,1), 3 in (1,0), 2 in (1,1), and zeros elsewhere. So how do these positions relate to the output's blocks?\n\nThe top-left 4x4 block corresponds to input cell (0,0) and (0,1) which are both 3. The middle 4x4 block corresponds to input cell (1,0) (3) and (1,1) (2). But in the output, the middle block is filled with 3's, not 2's. So perhaps the value in the input cell is not the value used in the output but indicates something else.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the middle block is filled with 3's, but the input cell (1,1) is 2. So maybe the value in the output is determined by the input cell's row or column index. Or perhaps the output value is the sum of the input cell's row and column indices. But in Example 0's input cell (0,0) is 3, but the output block is 3's. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the output value is the same as the input value. But in Example 0's input cell (1,1) is 2, but the output has 3's. So that's not the case.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to find another approach.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput:\n[0,0,0]\n[0,2,3]\n[0,3,3]\n\nOutput has a large 4x4 block of 3's starting from row 1, column 1, and another 4x4 block starting from row 5, column 5. The input has 3's in positions (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). So maybe these positions in the input correspond to the blocks in the output.\n\nWait, in the output, the first block of 3's starts at row 1, column 1. The input cell (1,2) is 3. Maybe the input cell's row and column indices determine the starting position in the output. For example, input cell (i,j) with value n starts at row i*(n+1) and column j*(n+1). For Example 1's cell (1,2) with value 3: row 1*(3+1) =4, column 2*(3+1)=8. But in the output, the 3's start at row 1, column 1, which doesn't match. So this idea might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input cell's value determines the number of times it's replicated in both directions. For example, a value of 3 means the cell is replicated 3 times to the right and 3 times down. So the cell (0,0) in Example 0 (value 3) would create a 4x4 block (original plus 3 replications). But then the cell (0,1) in Example 0 is also 3, which would create another 4x4 block starting at column 1. But overlapping with the first block. But the output doesn't show overlapping. In Example 0's output, the first four rows have four 3's in columns 0-3, then 0's. So maybe the replication is not overlapping but adjacent. So each cell's block is placed next to each other without overlapping. But how?\n\nIn Example 0's input row 0: [3,3,0]. If each 3 is replicated 3 times to the right and down, then the first cell (0,0) would create a 4x4 block. The next cell (0,1) would start at column 4 (after the first block's columns 0-3), creating another 4x4 block. The third cell (0,2) is 0, so no replication. So the first row of the output would have four rows, each with 8 3's and one 0. But the actual output has four 3's and five 0's. So that's not matching. Hence, this approach is invalid.\n\nHmm. Let's consider that each input cell's value determines the size of a square in the output, but the value in the square is determined by the cell's position. For example, in Example 0, the input cell (0,0) is 3, which creates a 3x3 square of 0's. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: The output for Example 0 looks like a larger matrix where each 3 in the input is replaced by a 4x4 block of 3's, and each 2 is replaced by a 3x3 block of 3's. But the input's 2 is in cell (1,1), but in the output, the middle block is 3's. Wait, in Example 0's output, the middle block (rows 4-7, columns 4-7) is filled with 3's. The input cell (1,1) is 2. So that doesn't make sense. Unless the output uses the row and column indices to determine the value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value in the input cell is irrelevant, and the pattern is based on the position. But that's unlikely since the examples have different inputs and outputs.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is a matrix representing the positions of certain blocks in the output. For example, each non-zero value indicates the size of a square block in the output. The position of the block in the output is determined by the input cell's coordinates multiplied by some factor. For instance, each cell (i,j) in the input corresponds to a block in the output starting at (i*3, j*3), and the size is (value+1)x(value+1). Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's input cell (0,0) is 3. So block starts at (0*3=0, 0*3=0) and has size 4x4. So covers rows 0-3, columns 0-3. The next cell (0,1) is 3, starts at (0*3=0, 1*3=3), size 4x4: columns 3-6. Wait, but 0+4-1=3, so columns 0-3 for the first block, then next block would start at column 4. Wait, perhaps the starting position is (i*(block_size), j*(block_size)), but that would depend on the block size, which varies per cell. This complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, each cell in the input indicates the size of a square block placed at (i, j) in the output. But the output is larger. Not sure.\n\nMaybe the output is constructed by scaling each input cell into a 3x3 block, where each element in the block is the original value. But that would make the output 9x9, but the examples have varying patterns. For example, in Example 0's output, the first four rows have 3's, which isn't a 3x3 block.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is that each input cell is replaced by a 3x3 block of itself, but then neighboring blocks are merged if they have the same value. But Example 0's output has large blocks of 3's and 0's, which could be merged from smaller blocks. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a convolution of the input matrix with a kernel, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the sum of the values in the input and output.\n\nExample 0's input sum: 3+3+0 +3+2+0 +0+0+0= 3+3+3+2= 11.\n\nOutput sum: Each row has 4 3's for four rows \u2192 4*4=16 3's. Then four rows with four 3's each \u2192 4*4=16. Total 32 3's. 32*3=96. The rest are zeros. So sum is 96.\n\nExample 1's input sum: 0+0+0 +0+2+3 +0+3+3= 2+3+3+3= 11. Output sum: Rows 1-4 (4 rows) have 4 3's each \u2192 4*4=16. Rows 5-8 (4 rows) have 4 3's each \u219216. Total 32 3's. 32*3=96. Same as Example 0. Interesting. So both training examples have input sum 11 and output sum 96. The test input's sum is 0+3+3 +0+2+3 +0+0+0= 3+3+2+3= 11. So the output sum would likely be 96 as well. So the output is always 32 3's. Which suggests that the pattern is not dependent on the input values except their sum. But that's not possible because the input values are different between examples, yet the output has the same number of 3's. So this might indicate that the output is a fixed transformation where all non-zero input elements contribute 3's in the output, regardless of their actual value. But how?\n\nBut in the training examples, the input values include 2 and 3. In the outputs, all non-zero values are 3's. So perhaps, regardless of the input value (as long as it's non-zero), the output uses 3's. So the transformation is replacing each non-zero input cell with a 4x4 block of 3's and each zero with a 1x1 block of 0. Then arranging these blocks in the grid.\n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples?\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nRow 0: 3,3,0 \u2192 two 4x4 blocks of 3's and one 1x1 0. So columns 0-3 (3's), 4-7 (3's), 8 (0). Rows 0-3 (height 4, since max value in row is 3 \u2192 3+1=4 rows). So the first four rows are 3's for columns 0-3 and 4-7, then 0. So each row would be 8 3's and one 0. But in the actual output, the first four rows are four 3's followed by five 0's. So that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the blocks are arranged in a different way. For example, each non-zero input cell is replaced by a 4x4 block of 3's, but the positioning is such that each block is placed starting at (i*4, j*4) in the output. But since the output is 9x9, this would fit for cells (0,0) \u2192 (0,0) to (3,3), (0,1) \u2192 (0,4) to (3,7). Then the third cell (0,2) is 0, so a 0 at (0,8). But the first row of the output would be 3's from 0-3, 3's from 4-7, and 0 at 8. So the row would be 8 3's and one 0. But the actual output's first row is four 3's and five 0's. This inconsistency suggests this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: The output is a 9x9 grid where each 3x3 section corresponds to an input cell. For example, the input cell (i,j) is mapped to a 3x3 block in the output's (i*3, j*3) position. And the value of the block depends on the input cell's value. For instance, if the input cell is 3, the corresponding 3x3 block is filled with 3's. But Example 0's output is larger than 3x3 blocks. However, Example 0's input is 3x3, and the output is 9x9, so each input cell maps to a 3x3 output block.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the first four rows have four 3's. So perhaps each input cell's value determines how many rows and columns in the output are filled. For example, a cell with value 3 fills the next 3+1=4 rows and columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the value of each input cell determines how many layers of 3's are added around it. For example, a cell with value 3 would create a 3-layer thick border around its position. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, the input represents a kind of run-length encoding. For instance, each row in the input describes how many consecutive 3's are placed in the output. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet's look back at Example 0's output. The first four rows are four 3's followed by five 0's. The next four rows (4-7) are four 0's, four 3's, and one 0. The last row is all 0's. This seems like two diagonal 4x4 blocks of 3's. The first block is at the top-left, and the second is shifted down and to the right. The input's non-zero cells are in positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). The output's blocks might be combining these cells. For example, the top-left block combines cells (0,0) and (0,1), which are both 3's. The middle block combines (1,0) and (1,1), where (1,0) is 3 and (1,1) is 2. But the output's middle block is filled with 3's, so the 2 in the input is not reflected. This suggests that the output's value is determined by the sum or some other function of the input cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by replacing each input cell with a 3x3 block, where the center of the block is the input value, and the surrounding cells are filled with 3's. For example, a cell with value 2 becomes a 3x3 block with 2 in the center and 3's around. But in Example 0's output, there are no 2's. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of the output as a combination of expanding each input cell's value into a 3x3 block, but with certain rules.\n\nAnother observation: In both training examples, the output has two large 4x4 blocks of 3's placed in diagonal positions. The first training example's output has a block at the top-left and another at the middle-right. The second example's output has a block starting at row 1, column 1, and another starting at row 5, column 5. This suggests that each block is offset by 4 rows and columns from the previous. So maybe each non-zero input cell contributes a 4x4 block of 3's at a position determined by its coordinates multiplied by 4. For example, cell (i,j) in the input places a block starting at row i*4, column j*4. But in Example 0's input cell (0,0) would start at (0,0), (0,1) at (0,4), but the output's first four rows have blocks from (0,0) to (3,3) and (0,4) to (3,7), leading to overlapping rows. But in the output, the first four rows are filled with 3's for columns 0-3 and 4-7, but the actual output shows only the first four columns as 3's. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input cell's value is the distance from the block's position. For example, value 3 means the block is placed 3 units away. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the number of 3's in each output row. In Example 0's first four rows, each has four 3's. Rows 4-7 have four 3's starting at column 4. So each of these rows has four 3's. The total number of 3's is 4*4 (first block) + 4*4 (second block) = 32. Which matches the sum we calculated earlier. So each non-zero cell contributes 16 3's (4 rows * 4 columns). Since there are two non-zero cells contributing in Example 0's input? Wait, Example 0's input has four non-zero cells: 3,3,3,2. But the output's 3's are 32, which is 8 per cell (32 /4=8). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero cell contributes 16 3's. But Example 0 has 3's in input cells summing to 3+3+3+2=11. Output sum is 96 (32*3). 96 divided by 11 is not an integer. So that's not a direct relation.\n\nMaybe the key is that each input cell's value is replaced by 3 in the output, and the pattern is about the positions and sizes of the blocks. For example, each non-zero cell in the input creates a 4x4 block of 3's in the output. The position of the block depends on the cell's coordinates. For instance, cell (i,j) in the input creates a block starting at row i*4 and column j*4. But in Example 0, this would create blocks at (0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4). But the output's first block is from row 0-3 and column 0-3, which is 4x4. Then another block at (0,4) would be columns 4-7. So the first four rows would have two 4x4 blocks. But in the output, the first four rows have one 4x4 block and the next four rows have another. So this approach may not fit.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's input, the cells with value 3 are at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0). The cell (1,1) is 2. The output has two large blocks of 3's: the first covers rows 0-3 and columns 0-3 (from cell (0,0)), and another from rows 4-7 and columns 4-7 (from cell (1,1) which is 2, but somehow transformed into 3's. This doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the value in the input cell is ignored, and any non-zero cell becomes a 4x4 block of 3's. So regardless of the input value (as long as it's non-zero), it's replaced by 3's in a 4x4 block. Let's check this.\n\nExample 0's input has four non-zero cells: (0,0)=3, (0,1)=3, (1,0)=3, (1,1)=2. So four non-zero cells, each replaced by a 4x4 block of 3's. The output would have four 4x4 blocks. But in the output, there are two 4x4 blocks. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample 1's input has four non-zero cells: (1,2)=3, (2,1)=3, (2,2)=3, and (1,1)=2. So four non-zero cells, which would generate four 4x4 blocks. The output has two such blocks, so again discrepancy.\n\nThis suggests that the value of the input cell is not directly determining the output value. Instead, maybe the output value is determined by the number of non-zero cells in a certain region of the input. But I'm not sure.\n\nAfter extensive thinking and trying different approaches, the most plausible pattern I can discern is that each input cell's value n is replaced by a (n+1)x(n+1) block of 3's, regardless of the original value. Then, these blocks are arranged in a grid where each block's position is determined by its input cell's coordinates multiplied by the maximum value in the row and column. This is a bit vague, but given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this hypothesis.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n[0,3,3]\n[0,2,3]\n[0,0,0]\n\nFollowing the pattern from the training examples, each non-zero cell would create a block of 3's with size (value +1)x(value +1). Let's identify the non-zero cells:\n\n- (0,1) =3 \u2192 4x4 block\n- (0,2) =3 \u21924x4 block\n- (1,1)=2 \u21923x3 block (but in training examples, 2's were transformed into 3's)\n- (1,2)=3 \u21924x4 block\n\nBut in the training examples, even the 2 in the input resulted in a block of 3's. So perhaps all non-zero cells are replaced with 3's, and the size is (value +1) x (value +1).\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRow 0: [0,3,3]. The max value is 3 \u21924 rows. The two non-zero cells (3 and 3) contribute 4x4 blocks each. So columns 1-4 and 2-5 (but need to arrange them next to each other). Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, each input row's blocks are placed horizontally next to each other. For row 0 of the test input: cells 0,1,2. Cell 0 is 0 \u21921x1 block of 0. Cell 1 is3 \u21924x4 of 3. Cell 2 is3 \u21924x4 of3. So the total columns would be 1+4+4=9. Similarly, row 0's max value is3 \u21924 rows. So the first four rows of the output would have 0 followed by 4 columns of3 and 4 columns of3. But the output from training examples had each block placed adjacent, not overlapping. For example, in Example 1, the first block starts at column 1, then next at column 5. So perhaps each block starts after the previous one's columns.\n\nSo for test input row 0:\n\n- Cell (0,0)=0 \u21921 column of 0.\n- Cell (0,1)=3 \u21924 columns of3.\n- Cell (0,2)=3 \u21924 columns of3.\n\nSo the first four rows of the output would be: 0, followed by 4 3's, then 4 3's \u2192 [0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]. But the training examples show that when there are multiple non-zero cells in a row, their blocks are placed consecutively. But in Example 0's first row, the first two cells are3, so their blocks are placed next to each other. But in Example 0's output, the first four rows have four 3's followed by five 0's. Which suggests that the blocks are placed in different rows as well. \n\nAlternatively, the output is constructed by vertically stacking the expanded rows. Each input row contributes (max value +1) rows in the output. Within each such row, each input cell's value is replaced by (value +1) copies of 3 if the cell is non-zero, or 0 otherwise. \n\nFor the test input:\n\nRow 0: [0,3,3]. Max value 3 \u21924 rows. Each cell contributes:\n\n- 0 \u21921 copy of 0.\n- 3 \u21924 copies of3.\n- 3 \u21924 copies of3.\n\nSo each row in this group would be 0 followed by 4+4=8 3's. So the rows would be [0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3], repeated four times.\n\nRow 1: [0,2,3]. Max value 3 \u21924 rows. Cells:\n\n- 0 \u21921 copy of0.\n- 2 \u21923 copies of3.\n-3 \u21924 copies of3.\n\nEach row would be 0 followed by 3 3's and 4 3's \u2192 total 0+3+4=7 elements. But the output needs 9 columns. So this approach doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the pattern that each input cell's value n is replaced by a 4x4 block of 3's if n is 3, a 3x3 block of 3's if n is 2, and a 0 if n is 0. The blocks are arranged in a grid where each input cell's block starts at (i*4, j*4). This would fit Example 0's output. For cell (0,0) \u21924x4 block at (0,0). Cell (0,1) \u21924x4 at (0,4). Cell (1,0) \u21924x4 at (4,0). Cell (1,1) \u21923x3 block at (4,4). But in Example 0's output, the middle block is 4x4 of 3's. So this doesn't explain it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps all non-zero cells are replaced with 4x4 blocks of 3's, ignoring their actual value. For Example 0, the output would have four 4x4 blocks, but the output only has two. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to proceed, I'll consider that the pattern is that each non-zero input cell (i,j) creates a 4x4 block of 3's starting at row i*4 and column j*4. However, in Example 0, this would produce blocks for (0,0) and (0,1) which would overlap in rows 0-3. But the output has four 3's in the first four columns and then four 3's in columns 4-7 for rows 0-3. So perhaps the columns are placed next to each other, but the rows are determined by the input row's max value.\n\nFor the test input, applying this pattern:\n\nTest Input:\n[0,3,3]\n[0,2,3]\n[0,0,0]\n\nThe non-zero cells are (0,1)=3, (0,2)=3, (1,1)=2, (1,2)=3.\n\nAssuming all non-zero cells become 4x4 blocks of 3's:\n\n- (0,1) starts at row 0, column 4 \u2192 rows 0-3, columns 4-7.\n- (0,2) starts at row 0, column 8 \u2192 rows 0-3, columns 8-11 (but output is only 9 columns, so this is invalid).\n- So this can't be correct.\n\nAlternatively, each cell's block starts at (i*3, j*3), and is of size (n+1)x(n+1). So for test cell (0,1)=3: 4x4 block at (0*3, 1*3)=(0,3). So rows 0-3, columns 3-6.\n\nCell (0,2)=3: (0,6) \u2192 columns 6-9, but output has 9 columns. So columns 6-9 would be out of bounds. Hence, invalid.\n\nThis approach isn't working. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll look for a pattern where each input cell's value n is replaced by a 4x4 block of 3's if n>=2, and a 3x3 block if n=2, but this is not matching the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by expanding each input cell into a 3x3 block where the block is filled with the input value plus 0's. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAfter struggling, I think the correct pattern is that each input cell's value n is replaced by a (n+1)x(n+1) block filled with 3's, and zero otherwise. The blocks are arranged in the output grid such that each input cell's block starts at position (i*(n+1), j*(n+1)), but this is not matching the examples. \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by replacing each input cell with a 3x3 block filled with 3's if the cell is non-zero, and 0's otherwise. Then, the entire matrix is scaled by a factor of 3. But this also doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to the final answer based on the observation that each non-zero input cell contributes a 4x4 block of 3's, and zero contributes 1x1. The output's rows are determined by the input rows' max value. So for the test input:\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,3,3]. Max value 3 \u21924 rows. Cells: 0 (1 column), 3 (4 columns), 3 (4 columns). So each row in this group would be 0 followed by 4+4=8 3's. But output requires 9 columns. So 0, then 4 3's, then 4 3's, totaling 9 columns. So each of the four rows would be [0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nRow 1: [0,2,3]. Max value 3 \u21924 rows. Cells: 0 (1), 2 (3 columns), 3 (4 columns). So each row would be 0, followed by 3 3's, then 4 3's \u2192 0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3. Wait, 1+3+4=8, but need 9 columns. Maybe the 2 contributes 3 columns, and the 3 contributes 4, plus 0's 1, making 8. Hmm, this doesn't add up. Maybe there's a mistake in this approach.\n\nAlternatively, each non-zero cell contributes 4 columns of 3's, zeros contribute 1. So for test row 0: 1+4+4=9 columns. Each row would be 0, followed by four 3's, then four 3's. So [0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3].\n\nRow 1: max value 3 \u21924 rows. Cells: 0 (1), 2 (3 columns?), 3 (4). So 1+3+4=8. But need 9. So maybe the 2 contributes 3 columns, then 3 contributes 5? Not sure. But given the time, I'll proceed.\n\nFor the test input, the output would have:\n\nFirst four rows (from row 0 of input):\n\n[0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] repeated four times.\n\nNext four rows (from row 1 of input):\n\n[0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] (assuming the 2 is treated as 3), but this is uncertain.\n\nLast row (from row 2 of input) all zeros.\n\nBut comparing to training examples, perhaps the test input's output would have two blocks of 3's: one starting in row 0, column 1 (due to input cell (0,1)=3), and another starting in row 4, column 5 (due to input cell (1,2)=3). So the output would have:\n\nRows 0-3: 0 followed by four 3's, then four 3's.\n\nRows 4-7: zeros for the first four columns, then four 3's, then four 3's.\n\nRow 8: all zeros.\n\nBut this is a guess. However, looking back at the training examples, the outputs have the blocks placed diagonally. For example, in Example 1, the first block starts at row 1, column 1, and the second starts at row 5, column 5. So perhaps each input cell (i,j) with value n contributes a 4x4 block starting at row i*4 and column j*4. But in Example 1, cell (1,2) with value 3 would start at row 4, column 8. But the output's block starts at row 5, column 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time, I'll settle for the following answer based on the training examples' structure. The test input's output should have two 4x4 blocks of 3's, one starting in the second row and first column, and another starting in the fifth row and fifth column, with the rest zeros. The actual arrangement would mimic the training examples' diagonal blocks.",
