        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has various numbers like 8, 3, 4, 1, etc. The output seems to have some of these numbers moved or transformed. For instance, in the third row of the input, there's [0, 0, 3, 8, 1, 0,...], and in the output, the same row becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,...], but in another row (row 2) of the output, there's [0, 0, 8, 4, 8, 0,...]. It looks like maybe certain numbers are being shifted down or to the side. Maybe there's a direction involved, like gravity pulling numbers down or to the right?\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output in Example 1 shows that these 3s are transformed into a horizontal line. For example, the input's row 4 has [0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 0,...], and in the output, the 3s spread out to the right. The output's row 11 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2]. So maybe when there's a number (like 3) adjacent vertically, they turn into a horizontal line in the output, possibly forming a cross or expanding in a certain direction.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has an 8, 1, 8, 2, etc. The output seems to form a diamond or a plus shape around the 1 and 2. For example, the input's row 4 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 0,...], and the output's row 11 is [0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 0,...]. It looks like numbers adjacent to 1 and 2 are being replicated to form a pattern around them. Maybe numbers like 1 and 2 act as centers that spread their adjacent numbers in specific directions.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern might involve certain numbers (like 1, 2, 3, 4, 8) acting as attractors or centers, causing nearby numbers to cluster around them in specific directions. For instance, when a number like 3 is present, the output forms a horizontal line, while 1 and 2 might form diamond shapes. Also, numbers might be \"falling\" towards these centers, filling in zeros around them based on their positions.\n\nNow, looking at the test input. There are numbers like 5, 1, 2, 4. For example, in row 4, there's [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5,5,4,...]. Also, in row 6, there's 2,5,5,5. And in row 11, there's 4,5,1. The 1 and 2 here might act as centers. Following the pattern from the examples, maybe the 5s around the 1 and 2 would form horizontal or diamond-shaped patterns. For instance, around the 1 in row 4, perhaps the 5s would spread out horizontally or vertically. Similarly, the 2 in row 6 might have surrounding 5s arranged in a pattern.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Example 0, the output moved some numbers down. Maybe the transformation involves moving numbers towards the bottom or right if there's a specific number nearby. Also, zeros in the input might get filled with numbers from above or adjacent cells based on certain rules.\n\nTesting this idea: in the test input's row 4, the 1 is surrounded by 5s. If the 1 acts as a center, the output might form a cross or diamond of 5s around it. Similarly, the 2 in row 6 has 5s next to it. Maybe those 5s form a line. The 2 in row 9 (5,2) might cause the 5 to spread in some direction. Also, the 1 in row 15 (0,0,0,0,1,0...) might form a pattern around it.\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the numbers 8 and 3 were used, but here the test uses 5. So maybe the actual numbers don't matter as much as their positions relative to certain key numbers like 1 and 2, which might act as anchors. For example, when a 1 or 2 is present, the adjacent numbers (like 5 here) form a pattern around them.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the vertical 3s turned into horizontal in the output. So perhaps numbers adjacent to a certain key number (maybe 1 or 4) cause the numbers to shift direction. Or maybe the presence of a number (like 4 in Example 1's input row 4) affects how the 3s are transformed.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that certain numbers (like 1, 2, 3, 4, 8) act as \"sources\" that cause surrounding cells to be filled with a specific number in a specific direction. For instance, a 1 might cause the cells around it to be filled with 8s in a diamond shape, as in Example 0 and 2. Similarly, a 2 might cause a horizontal line. But in the test input, the numbers are 5 and 1, 2. So perhaps the 1 and 2 here are acting similarly, causing the 5s around them to form patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to rotate the clusters of numbers. For example, in Example 0, some clusters are moved down. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: compare the positions of non-zero elements in input and output. For instance, in Example 0's input row 3: [0,0,8,4,8,0...], in output row 2: [0,0,8,4,8,0...]. So that row moved up. Wait, no. The input's row 3 becomes output's row 2. Wait, no. Let me check again. The input in Example 0 has 14 rows, and the output also has 14 rows. Looking at the third input row (index 2): [0,0,3,8,1,0...], and in the output, row 2 is [0,0,0,0,0,0...], but row 9 becomes [0,0,1,8,0,0...]. Hmm, maybe the non-zero numbers are being shifted down or to the right, but only if certain conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any number adjacent (vertically or horizontally) to a 1 or 2 gets propagated in a certain direction. For example, in Example 0, the 8 near the 1 might spread. In Example 2, the 1 is surrounded by 8s, and the output forms a diamond. So maybe the rule is that for each 1 or 2, the adjacent cells (in cross shape) are filled with the number that's adjacent to them in the input.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input row 4, there's 1,8,8,8,2. The output row 11 becomes a diamond shape with 8s around the 1 and 2. So perhaps when a 1 or 2 is present, the surrounding cells (up, down, left, right, and maybe diagonals) get filled with the adjacent numbers. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 1 or 2 acts as a center, and the surrounding cells in a certain radius are filled with the same number as the center's adjacent cells. For instance, if a 1 is next to an 8, then the 8 is propagated in a cross shape around the 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being rotated or mirrored. For example, in Example 0's input row 2, the numbers 3,8,1 become in the output row 9: 1,8,0. But not sure.\n\nAnother angle: look for the positions of 1s and 2s in the input and see how they affect the output. In Example 0, there's a 1 in row 2 (input), and in the output, that 1 is in row 9. Also, in the output, around that 1, there are 8s. So maybe the 1 in the input causes the 8s to form around it in the output. But how?\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 1 in row 8 (third from the end) and a 2 in row 3. The output shows that the 1 in row 11 has 3s around it. So perhaps the 1 attracts the 3s to form a horizontal line.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, there's a 1 in row 8, column 5. The output's row 11 has [...,1,3,3,3,3,2]. So the 1 is followed by four 3s and then a 2. So maybe the 1 and 2 are connected by 3s in the output. But the input has a 1 in row 8 and a 2 in row 11. So the output connects them with a line of 3s.\n\nHmm, maybe the pattern is that between certain numbers (like 1 and 2), the cells in between are filled with another number (like 3 in Example 1). But that's just one example. Alternatively, numbers like 1 and 2 act as endpoints, and the numbers in between are filled based on adjacent numbers in the input.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the numbers in the input, perhaps the output is a convolution or some kind of cellular automaton step. For example, each cell in the output is determined by its neighbors in the input. For instance, if a cell in the input is a certain number, the output cell becomes a different number based on rules.\n\nBut given the training examples, it's challenging to find a consistent rule. Let's try to look for a common transformation.\n\nAnother approach: In Example 0, the input has a cluster of 8s and 4 in row 3. The output in row 2 has those 8 and 4 shifted up? Wait, the input row 3 (0-based index 2) is [0,0,3,8,1,0...], and the output row 2 is [0,0,0,0,0,0...], but row 3 of output is [0,0,0,0,0,0...]. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list the input rows and output rows for Example 0:\n\nInput rows (14 rows):\n\n0: all zeros\n1: [0,0,0,8,0,...]\n2: [0,0,3,8,1,0...]\n3: [0,0,8,4,8,0...]\n4: ... has 3 and 1\n...\nOutput rows (14 rows):\n\n0: zeros\n1: zeros\n2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,4,8,0]\n3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,8,8,1]\n...\nRow 9: [0,0,1,8,0,0...]\n\nSo in the output, the 8,4,8 from input row 3 (index 3) has moved up to row 2 (index 2) but shifted to the right? Or perhaps it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to rotate the grid 90 degrees and then apply some shifts. But that might not fit.\n\nAnother thought: the output could be a reflection of the input along a diagonal, but that might not align with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the sum or product of adjacent cells. But looking at Example 0's input row 3 (8,4,8) and output row 2 (8,4,8), maybe they are preserved but shifted. However, how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by moving certain numbers to the right or down, filling in zeros, but only if they are adjacent to certain other numbers. For example, in Example 0, the 8 in input row 1 moves down to output row 9. Wait, input row 1 has an 8 at column 3. Output row 9 has 8 in column 3. So maybe numbers move down if possible, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are moving to the bottom of the grid. For instance, in Example 0's input, the 8 in row 1 (column 3) is moved down to row 9 in the output. That's a shift of 8 rows down. But the grid is 14 rows, so row 1 +8 = row 9. Similarly, other numbers may be shifted down by 8 rows. But in Example 0's input row 2 has a 3,8,1 which in the output is in row 9 as 1,8. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are arranged in the output such that they form a symmetric pattern around certain axes. For example, in Example 2's output, the 1 and 2 are in the middle of a diamond shape. Maybe the output is a mirror or some symmetry of the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by expanding each number into a cross shape. For instance, a number 3 in the input becomes a horizontal line of 3s in the output. But in Example 1, vertical 3s become horizontal in the output. So maybe numbers are rotated 90 degrees. But then why?\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by a combination of moving numbers downward and to the right, filling in zeros as they move, but only if certain conditions are met. For example, if a number is below another number, it moves down, or if it's to the right, it moves right.\n\nBut without more examples, this is tricky. Let's try to see if there's a common pattern across all three examples.\n\nExample 0's input has a 3,8,1 in row 2. Output row 9 has 1,8. Example 0's output row 4 has 3,8,8,8,1. Maybe the 1 and 3 are connected via 8s. Similarly, Example 1's input has a vertical column of 3s, and the output has a horizontal line of 3s connected to the 1 and 2.\n\nExample 2's input has a horizontal line of 8s around a 1 and 2, and the output forms a diamond shape. So perhaps when numbers are adjacent to a 1 or 2, they form a cross or diamond around them.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: for each occurrence of 1 or 2 in the input, look at the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) and in the output, fill those directions with the numbers that were adjacent to the 1 or 2. For example, if a 1 has an 8 to its left, then in the output, the left, right, up, down cells around the 1 are filled with 8.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 1 (row 2, column 4) is next to an 8 (column 3) and a 3 (column 2). In the output, row 9 has [0,0,1,8,0,0...]. The 8 is to the right of the 1. Also, row 4 of the output has 3,8,8,8,1. So maybe the 1's adjacent numbers are spread out around it in the output.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers adjacent to 1s and 2s in the input are replicated in certain directions in the output. For example, if a 1 has an 8 to its left, then in the output, the 8 is placed to the left, right, up, and down of the 1.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the 1 is in row 9, column 2 (assuming 0-based index). The output row 9 is [0,0,1,8,0...], so the 8 is to the right. The output row 4 has 3,8,8,8,1. So maybe the 1's original left neighbor (3) and right neighbor (nothing, since input row 2 for 1 is at position 4, next is 0) but in the output, it's surrounded by 8s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1 and 2 act as centers, and their adjacent numbers in the input are mirrored in the output. For example, whatever is to the left of the 1 in the input becomes mirrored to the right, and vice versa. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 1 is in row 8 (third from the end) and column 4. The output's row 11 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,3,3,3,2], so the 1 is followed by four 3s and a 2. The input's 1 is part of a row [0,0,0,3,1,3,0...], so the 1 has a 3 to the left and right. In the output, the 1 is followed by four 3s and a 2, which was in the input's row 11 (input row 11 has a 2). So maybe the 1 and 2 are connected via 3s in the output, forming a bridge between them.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2's input, the 1 and 2 are in the same row, separated by 8s. The output forms a diamond around them. So perhaps the 1 and 2 are connected in a way that their adjacent numbers form a pattern between them.\n\nPutting this all together, maybe the rule is:\n\n1. Identify all 1s and 2s in the input.\n2. For each 1 or 2, look at their adjacent numbers (up, down, left, right) in the input.\n3. In the output, create a cross (horizontal and vertical lines) originating from the 1 or 2, filling those lines with the adjacent numbers found in the input.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's input, the 1 has an 8 to its left. So in the output, the 1 would have a horizontal line of 8s to the left and right. But in the output, the 1 is followed by an 8. Maybe vertical line?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers adjacent to 1s and 2s are replicated in all four directions (up, down, left, right) in the output.\n\nBut in Example 0, the 1 is next to an 8 (left) and a 0 (right). So the output might have 8s to the left and right. But in the output, the 1 in row 9 has an 8 to the right. Maybe only the non-zero adjacents are replicated.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each 1 and 2 is a cross shape (up, down, left, right) filled with the maximum adjacent number found in the input.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking each cluster around 1s and 2s and expanding them into crosses.\n\nIn the test input, there are several 1s and 2s. For example, row 4 has a 1 surrounded by 5s and a 4. Row 6 has a 2 next to 5s. Row 9 has a 2 next to 5. Row 11 has a 1 next to 4 and 5. Row 15 has a 1. Row 19 has a 1.\n\nFollowing the pattern, the output would need to create crosses around these 1s and 2s filled with their adjacent numbers. For example, the 1 in row 4 is surrounded by 5s and a 4. So in the output, there might be crosses of 5s and 4s around this 1. Similarly, the 2 in row 6 is next to 5s, so the output might have a cross of 5s around it.\n\nAdditionally, numbers not adjacent to 1s or 2s might be moved down or to the right, filling zeros, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the positions of the numbers in the output. In Example 0, the output seems to have numbers shifted downward. For example, the 8 in input row 1 (column 3) appears in output row 9 (column 3). That's 8 rows below. Similarly, other numbers might be shifted down by 8 rows. But the input has 14 rows, so shifting by 8 would wrap around, but in Example 0, row 1 +8 is row 9, which exists. However, this doesn't explain all transformations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of shifting certain rows down and creating patterns around 1s and 2s. But this is getting too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that 1s and 2s in the input act as centers, and their adjacent numbers in the input are spread into cross shapes (horizontal and vertical lines) in the output. For example, if a 1 has a 5 to its left in the input, then in the output, the 1's row and column will be filled with 5s in a cross shape.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nLooking at row 4 of the test input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5,5,4,0...]. The 1 is at column 6 (0-based?), with 5 to the left (column 5?), 5 to the right (columns 7 and 8), and 4 below (column 9). So the output might have a horizontal line of 5s through the 1 (left and right) and vertical line of 5s and 4s. But maybe the vertical line uses the number below, which is 4. So vertical could be 5 (up) and 4 (down), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output cross takes the maximum number adjacent to the 1. For example, the 1 is surrounded by 5s and a 4. So the cross would be filled with 5s (the highest number). So around the 1 in row 4, there would be a cross of 5s in all four directions.\n\nSimilarly, the 2 in row 6 (input row 6 is [0,0,0,0,0,2,5,5,5,0...]. The 2 is at column 5, with 5s to the right. So in the output, the 2 would have a horizontal line of 5s to the left and right, and vertical line using the numbers above and below. But since there's a 5 below, maybe vertical line is 5s.\n\nIn the test input's row 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,0...]. The 2 is next to 5 on the left. So the output would have a horizontal line of 5s to the left and right of the 2, and vertical line of 5s (assuming the 2 has a 5 above or below).\n\nRow 11 of the test input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,5,1,0...]. The 1 is at column 13, with 5 to the left and 4 two positions left. So maybe the cross around 1 would include 5s and 4s, but not sure.\n\nRow 15: [0,0,0,0,1,0...]. The 1 has no adjacent numbers, so maybe no cross forms.\n\nRow 19: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0...]. Again, 1 has no adjacents, so no cross.\n\nPutting this together, the output would have crosses of 5s around the 1s and 2s that are adjacent to 5s. For example, the 1 in row 4 would have a cross of 5s in all directions. The 2 in row 6 would have a horizontal line of 5s. The 2 in row 9 (5,2) would have a horizontal line of 5s to the left and right, and maybe vertical line if there's a number above or below.\n\nAdditionally, other numbers like 4 and 5 might form patterns. For example, the 4 in row 4 (column 10) is adjacent to 5s. Maybe this 4 causes a vertical line of 4s.\n\nBut this is speculative. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to construct the test output based on the hypothesis that 1s and 2s generate crosses of their adjacent numbers, and other numbers are shifted or moved in a certain way.\n\nAnother observation: in the test input's row 11, there's a 4,5,1. The 1 is next to 5 and 4. So the cross around the 1 might have 5 and 4. For example, to the left of 1 is 5, so the horizontal line would be 5s; above and below, it's 4 and something else. But without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, the cross takes the numbers from the direction they were in. For example, if the 1 has a 5 to the left, the cross extends left and right with 5s. If there's a 4 below, the cross extends up and down with 4s.\n\nSo in row 4's 1, which is surrounded by 5s on left, right, and up (since it's in a sequence of 5,1,5,5,4), maybe the cross would be horizontal 5s and vertical 5s and 4. But the 4 is below, so down is 4, up is 5 (from row 4's input, the 1 is in column 6. The row above (row 3) has a 5 in column 6? No, row 3 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0...]. So the cell above the 1 (row 4's column 6) is row 3's column 6, which is 0. So maybe only the existing numbers are considered.\n\nIn that case, for the 1 in row 4, the adjacent numbers are left (5), right (5,5), and down (4). So the cross would be horizontal: left and right filled with 5s; vertical: down filled with 4s. Up is 0, so no. So the output would have a horizontal line of 5s through the 1 and vertical line of 4s downward from the 1.\n\nBut how far do these lines extend? In the examples, sometimes they fill the entire row or column. For example, in Example 1's output, the 1 is followed by four 3s and a 2, suggesting the line extends until the next key number.\n\nAlternatively, the lines extend until they hit another number or the edge.\n\nIn the test input's row 4, the 1 is at column 6. To the left are 5s (columns 5,6?), maybe. The input row 4 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5,5,4,0...]. So the 1 is at column 6 (assuming 0-based), left is 5 (column 5?), right is 5 (column 7), then 5 (column 8), 4 (column 9). So the horizontal cross would extend left to column 5 and right to column 8, filled with 5s. The vertical cross would extend down (row 5, column 6 is 0; row 4's column 9 is 4, so maybe down from the 1 at column 6, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the vertical line is formed by the number below the 1. In row 4's input, the cell below the 1 (row 5, column 6) is 0. The cell two rows below (row 6, column 6) is 5. But maybe the vertical line is formed by the number directly below in the input. Since it's 0, maybe no vertical line.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Perhaps the safest way is to look for the most prominent features in the test input and replicate the pattern from the examples.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to draft an output where the 1s and 2s in the test input are surrounded by crosses of their adjacent numbers. For instance:\n\n- The 1 in row 4, surrounded by 5s and a 4, would have a horizontal line of 5s and a vertical line of 5 and 4.\n\nBut without a clear pattern from the examples, this is challenging. However, given that in Example 1, vertical 3s became horizontal in the output, perhaps the test input's horizontal 5s around 1s would become vertical, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, the output forms a diamond shape around 1s and 2s using the numbers adjacent to them. For example, the 1 in row 4's input has 5s on left, right, and up (row 3's column 6 is 0, so up is 0), and a 4 below. So the diamond would include 5s and 4.\n\nBut given the uncertainty, I'll proceed to construct the output for the test input based on the following assumptions:\n\n1. Each 1 or 2 in the input generates a cross (horizontal and vertical lines) in the output.\n2. The horizontal line uses the numbers to the left and right of the 1/2.\n3. The vertical line uses the numbers above and below the 1/2.\n4. If multiple numbers are adjacent, perhaps the furthest or the most prevalent is used.\n\nApplying this:\n\nTest input row 4: [...,5,1,5,5,4...]\n- 1 is at column 6.\n- Left: 5 (column 5)\n- Right: 5 (columns 7,8)\n- Below: 4 (column 9)\n- Above: 0 (column 6, row 3)\nSo horizontal line: fill columns 5-8 with 5s.\nVertical line: from row 4 down, fill with 4.\n\nThus, in the output, row 4 would have 5s from columns 5-8, and a 4 below.\n\nTest input row 6: [...,2,5,5,5...]\n- 2 is at column 5.\n- Right: 5s (columns 6-8)\n- Left: 0 (column 4)\n- Below: 0\n- Above: 0\nSo horizontal line to the right: 5s from column 6-8.\n\nTest input row 9: [...,5,2]\n- 2 at column 10.\n- Left:5 (column 9)\n- Right:0\n- Above:0\n- Below:0\nSo horizontal line to the left: 5s from column 9.\n\nTest input row 11: [...,4,5,1]\n- 1 at column 13.\n- Left:5 (column 12)\n- Right:0\n- Above:4 (column 11)\n- Below:0\nSo horizontal line to the left (5), vertical line above (4).\n\nRow 15: [...,1...] no adjacent numbers, so no cross.\n\nRow 19: [...,1...] no adjacent numbers.\n\nAdditionally, the 2 in row 6's input might generate a horizontal line of 5s to the right.\n\nPutting this all together, the output would have:\n\n- In row 4, a horizontal line of 5s around the 1 and a vertical line of 4s below.\n- In row 6, a horizontal line of 5s to the right of the 2.\n- In row 9, a horizontal line of 5s to the left of the 2.\n- In row 11, a horizontal line of 5s to the left of the 1 and vertical line of 4s above.\n\nBut how this translates into the actual output rows and columns depends on the exact positions.\n\nGiven the complexity and time, I'll proceed to generate an output that resembles the examples, with horizontal and vertical lines around 1s and 2s using the adjacent numbers.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, I need to solve this puzzle by figuring out the transformation pattern from the given training examples and then applying it to the test input. Let me start by carefully analyzing each example to identify the pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nIn the input, there are various numbers like 8, 3, 1, 4, etc. The output seems to have some of these numbers moved or transformed. For instance, in row 2 of the input, there's [0, 0, 3, 8, 1, 0...], and in the output row 2, it becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0...] and then later in row 10, there's [0, 8, 8, 4, 0...]. It looks like some numbers are being shifted downwards. But how?\n\nAnother thing I notice is that in Example 0's output, certain structures like the 8,4,8 sequence from the input's row 3 (third row from top) appear in the output's row 2 (third from the bottom). Wait, maybe there's a vertical flip? Let me check the positions.\n\nOriginal input rows (assuming each array is a row from top to bottom):\n\nRow 3 (third row) in input is [0, 0, 8, 4, 8, 0...]. In the output, this seems to be moved to row 2 when looking from the bottom. The output has 23 rows (since the input for example 0 has 14 rows, output also has 14 rows). Wait, example 0 input has 14 rows, output also 14. So flipping vertically? Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 3 (counting from 0) is [0, 0, 8, 4, 8, 0...]. The output's row 2 (from the top) has [0, 0, 8,4,8...] but in a different position. Hmm, maybe not a simple flip. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are moving to the bottom in some way.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns where certain numbers are grouped. For instance, in Example 1's input, there's a vertical line of 3s in the middle. The output in Example 1's last few rows shows those 3s arranged horizontally around the 1. So maybe it's a matter of rotating or reflecting the positions of certain clusters.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the middle section has a vertical column of 3s. In the output, those 3s form a horizontal line next to the 1. So perhaps when there's a number (like 3) surrounding a center (like 1), they rotate from vertical to horizontal. That suggests that certain patterns are being transformed from vertical to horizontal or vice versa.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 2's input, there's a horizontal line of 8s in the middle (row 4: 1,8,8,8,2,8). The output shows those 8s arranged vertically around the 1 and 2. So maybe the pattern is to rotate certain clusters 90 degrees. For example, a horizontal line becomes vertical, or vice versa.\n\nPutting this together, the transformation might involve rotating clusters of numbers around certain central elements. The central elements could be 1, 2, 4, etc. When a cluster is adjacent to a central number, the direction of the cluster is rotated. For example, a vertical line of 3s above a 1 becomes a horizontal line to the right of the 1.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Identify clusters of numbers (like 8s, 3s) adjacent to central elements (like 1, 2, 4).\n2. Rotate the direction of the cluster around the central element. For example, vertical becomes horizontal, or horizontal becomes vertical.\n3. Place the rotated cluster in the corresponding position relative to the central element.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nIn Example 0's input, row 7 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0...]. The output in row 10 has [0,8,8,4,0...]. Wait, maybe the 3 is replaced? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the central element is 1 or 4, and surrounding numbers are rotated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are moving towards the bottom. Looking at Example 0's input row 2: [0,0,3,8,1,0...], in the output, the 3,8,1 might be transformed into 8,4,8 in a lower row. Hmm, that's not obvious.\n\nAnother angle: in Example 1's output, the 3s that were vertical in the input are horizontal in the output. The central element is 1. So the vertical line of 3s above and below the 1 becomes a horizontal line to the right and left of the 1. So perhaps the cluster is rotated 90 degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise around the central element.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2's input, there's a horizontal line of 8s around 1 and 2, and in the output, they become vertical. So rotating 90 degrees.\n\nSo the general pattern might be that whenever there's a cluster of the same number (like 3s, 8s) arranged in a line (horizontal or vertical) adjacent to a central element (like 1, 2, 4), the cluster is rotated 90 degrees, changing the direction from horizontal to vertical or vice versa.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's look for clusters around central elements (1, 2, 4, 5?) in the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input rows:\n\nRow 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 5, 5, 4, 0...]. Here, there's a cluster of 5s around 1 and 4. Maybe this cluster is horizontal and needs to be rotated to vertical.\n\nRow 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0...]. There's a horizontal line of 5s next to 2.\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,0...]. 5 and 2 adjacent.\n\nRow 11: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,5,1,0...]. 4,5,1 in a row.\n\nRow 16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0...]. A 1 with a 4 in row 13, but not adjacent.\n\nRow 19: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0...]. A 1.\n\nRow 21: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0...]. A 2.\n\nSo for each of these clusters, the transformation would rotate them. For example, in row 4 of the test input: 5,1,5,5,4. The 5s are to the left and right of 1 and 4. If rotated 90 degrees, they might become vertical. Similarly, the horizontal 5s next to 2 in row 6 would become vertical.\n\nApplying this, the output would have vertical clusters where there were horizontal ones, and vice versa.\n\nLet's see the test input row 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 5, 5, 4, 0...]. The 5s are horizontal around 1 and 4. Rotating them vertically would place them below or above. But since there's a 4 next to the 5s, perhaps the 5s around 1 and 4 form a horizontal line, which would become vertical. So the 5s would stack vertically below 1 and 4.\n\nSimilarly, the cluster of 5s next to 2 in row 6 is horizontal. Rotating to vertical would place them below the 2.\n\nIn the output, these clusters would become vertical columns. So for row 4's cluster, after rotation, the 5s would be arranged vertically around the 1 and 4. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, the rotation direction needs to be determined. For example, a horizontal line to the right of a central number (like 1) would become a vertical line below. But this depends on the original orientation.\n\nThis is getting a bit complex, but perhaps the key is to rotate each linear cluster (horizontal or vertical) adjacent to a central element by 90 degrees, changing their direction.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nFor the horizontal cluster of 5s around 1 and 4 in row 4, after rotation, they should form a vertical column. So the 5s that were to the left and right of 1 and 4 would now be above and below them. However, since the original row 4 has 5,1,5,5,4 in positions 6-10 (assuming 0-based index), rotating this would place the 5s in vertical alignment. But how does the 4 factor in here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each linear segment (like a sequence of 5s adjacent to a 1) is rotated. For example, the 5s next to the 1 in row 4 (positions 6 and 8: 5, 1, 5,5,4) would form a horizontal line. Rotating this 90 degrees clockwise would place them vertically below the 1.\n\nBut perhaps the transformation is more about mirroring or flipping the positions. Another possibility is that the clusters are moved to the bottom of the grid, but that might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are shifted down as much as possible, similar to a gravity effect. But looking at the training examples, that doesn't seem to fit. For instance, in Example 0, the 8 in the third row moves to the 10th row in the output, which is further down. So maybe numbers fall down to the bottom, but there's more to it.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input row 3 is [0,0,8,4,8,0...], and in the output row 2 (third from the bottom), the same numbers appear. So perhaps the rows are reversed. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input has 14 rows. If reversed, row 0 becomes row 13, row 1 becomes row 12, etc. Let's check if the output rows are reversed. For example, the input row 3 (index 3) would become output row 10 (14-3-1=10). The output row 10 has [0,8,8,4,0...], which matches the input row 3's [0,0,8,4,8...] but arranged differently. So maybe not a simple reversal, but perhaps some other transformation.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are being shifted to the bottom of their respective columns. For example, each column is processed so that non-zero numbers fall to the bottom, maintaining order. But looking at Example 0's output, this doesn't seem to be the case. For example, in column 3 of the input example 0, there's an 8 in row 1, 3 in row 2, 8 in row 3, etc. In the output, these might stack at the bottom of the column. But looking at the output rows, the 8 in column 3 appears in row 10. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could involve moving all non-zero elements to the bottom rows while preserving their order. But in Example 1's input, there's a vertical line of 3s in the middle rows, and in the output, they are moved to the bottom rows. For instance, the output's row 11 (second to last) has the 3s arranged horizontally. So maybe non-zero elements are moved to the bottom, but arranged in a way that their original pattern is rotated or transformed.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let me look for another pattern.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the non-zero numbers are scattered, and in the output, they seem to form certain shapes. For instance, the output row 10 has 8,8,4 which in the input were in row 3. Maybe each non-zero number is moved down by a certain number of rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are moved down as far as possible until they hit another number or the bottom. For example, in a column, each non-zero number falls down, stacking on top of others. This is like a gravity effect. Let's test this hypothesis with Example 0.\n\nLooking at column 3 in Example 0's input:\n\nRow 1: 8\n\nRow 2: 3\n\nRow 3: 8\n\nRow 10: 4\n\nIf gravity is applied, the non-zero numbers in column 3 would stack at the bottom. So the 8 from row 1, 3 from row 2, 8 from row 3, and 4 from row 10 would all fall to the bottom of the column. But in the output column 3, there's a 8,8,4 in row 10 and 8 in row 3. So this doesn't fit. So gravity isn't the direct answer.\n\nAnother approach: looking for specific transformations where certain numbers (like 8,3,1) form cross shapes or other patterns. For example, in Example 0's output row 2 (third from bottom), there's 8,4,8. This could be a cross around the 4. But how does this relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are being mirrored or shifted in a specific direction. For example, shifting all elements to the right or left. But in Example 1's output, the vertical 3s become horizontal, which doesn't fit a simple shift.\n\nWait, another observation: in each example's output, the non-zero numbers are arranged in cross-like structures or horizontal/vertical lines around certain central numbers. For instance, in Example 1's output, row 11 has 1 surrounded by 3s horizontally, and row 12 has 3s vertically. So perhaps the transformation is creating a cross (horizontal and vertical) around certain central numbers.\n\nBut how does that happen from the input? In Example 1's input, the central 1 is in row 8 (index 8), and there's a vertical line of 3s above and below. The output creates a cross around the 1, with horizontal 3s on the same row and vertical 3s in the column. So maybe the input's vertical line is transformed into a horizontal line, and the existing horizontal elements (if any) into vertical.\n\nBut this is speculative. Let's think about the test input.\n\nIn the test input, there are several clusters. Let's take row 4: 5,1,5,5,4. This is a horizontal line of 5s around 1 and 4. If the pattern is to create a cross, the output would have a vertical line of 5s above and below the 1 and 4. Similarly, the horizontal 5s next to 2 in row 6 would become vertical 5s around 2.\n\nApplying this, the output would have vertical 5s in the columns corresponding to the positions where the horizontal clusters were. For example, in row 4's case, the 5s to the left and right of 1 and 4 would become 5s above and below them.\n\nSo for the test input row 4, after transformation, the 5s would form a vertical line through the 1 and 4. Similarly, the 5s around the 2 in row 6 would form a vertical line.\n\nLooking at the other examples, this seems plausible. For instance, in Example 2's input, the horizontal 8s around 1 and 2 become vertical in the output.\n\nSo the general pattern is: whenever there's a horizontal line of the same number adjacent to a central element (like 1,2,4), those numbers are rearranged into a vertical line passing through the central element. Similarly, if there's a vertical line, it becomes horizontal.\n\nThus, the transformation is to rotate the direction of the cluster (horizontal to vertical or vice versa) around the central element.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\n- Identify all horizontal clusters around central elements and rotate them to vertical.\n- Identify all vertical clusters and rotate them to horizontal.\n\nLet's go through the test input step by step.\n\nFirst, find all central elements (probably 1,2,4,5). But looking at the examples, central elements might be 1,2,4. In Example 0, the 4 is part of a structure. In Example 2, 1 and 2 are central.\n\nIn the test input, the central elements are 1 (rows 4, 11, 15, 19), 2 (rows 6,9,21), 4 (rows4, 11, 13, 16), and 5 (possibly part of clusters).\n\nFor each central element, check adjacent clusters.\n\nStarting with row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5,5,4,0...]. Here, the central elements are 1 and 4. The 5s are in positions 6,8,9 (assuming 0-based). So horizontally adjacent to 1 (position7) and 4 (position10). The cluster is horizontal. Rotate this to vertical. So, the 5s would be placed vertically around the 1 and 4. So in the output, in column7 (where 1 is), there would be 5s above and below. Similarly, for column10 (4), 5s above and below.\n\nBut how exactly? Let's see. The original horizontal cluster is 5,1,5,5,4. The 5s are to the left of 1 and right of 1 and 4. Rotating this 90 degrees clockwise would make the 5s below the 1 and 4. But since there are multiple central elements, this could get complex.\n\nAlternatively, each central element (1,4) would have their own vertical clusters. So the 5s adjacent to 1 would become vertical below and above 1. The 5 adjacent to 4 would become vertical above and below 4.\n\nBut perhaps the entire horizontal line of 5s around 1 and 4 becomes a vertical line. For example, the 5s in positions 6,7 (wait, no: original row4 has positions 6 as 5, position7 as 1, 8 as 5, 9 as5, 10 as4. So the 5s are at 6,8,9. So the 1 is between 5 and 5. The 4 is after the 5s. So when rotated, perhaps the 5s form a vertical column starting at the 1's position. So the vertical line would be in column7 (where 1 is), with 5 above and below. But maybe the 5s from positions6,8,9 are stacked vertically.\n\nThis is getting a bit unclear. Let's consider another example. In Example 1's input, the vertical 3s around the 1 become horizontal. So vertical to horizontal. So in the test input, horizontal clusters become vertical.\n\nSo for the test input's row4 cluster:\n\nOriginal horizontal 5s around 1 and 4. Rotate to vertical. So the 5s would form a vertical line in the columns where they were horizontally placed.\n\nBut how? The original row4 has 5,1,5,5,4. The 5s are at columns6,8,9. Rotating this cluster 90 degrees clockwise would mean the 5s are now in column7 (the position of 1) but in rows above and below. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the entire horizontal sequence of 5s around the 1 and 4 is converted into a vertical line in the same columns. For example, the 5s in columns6,8,9 become vertical in rows below the original row4.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to look for another approach.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output is generated by taking the input and for each cell, if it's non-zero and part of a horizontal line, rotate it to vertical and vice versa, then combine the results.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each example is generated by moving certain clusters to the bottom of the grid. For example, in Example0, the 3,8,1 in row2 moves down to row10. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a mirror of the input with some transformation. For example, flipping vertically and then applying some rotation.\n\nAt this point, given the time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn Example2's input, the horizontal line of 8s around 1 and 2 becomes vertical in the output. So the test input's row4 cluster of 5s around 1 and 4 would become vertical. Similarly, the row6 cluster of 5s around 2 would become vertical.\n\nSo applying this:\n\nFor row4's 5s: the horizontal line becomes vertical, so in column6 (original 5), column7 (1), columns8,9 (5s), and column10 (4). But this is a bit messy. Alternatively, the 5s adjacent to 1 become a vertical line through the 1's position.\n\nIn the test input's row4: positions6-10 are 5,1,5,5,4. Rotating this to vertical would create a vertical line in column7 (where 1 is) with 5s above and below. Also, the 5 in column6 and the 5s in 8,9 might form vertical lines. But how?\n\nAlternatively, each segment of the same number adjacent to a central element is rotated. For example, the 5s to the left of 1 (column6) and the 5s to the right of 1 (columns8,9) would form a vertical line through column7 (the 1's column). So the output would have 5s in row3, column7; row4, column7 (which is the 1), and row5, column7 (5), etc.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to draft an output based on rotating horizontal clusters to vertical around central elements.\n\nFor the test input:\n\n- Row4 has 5,1,5,5,4. Convert the horizontal 5s around 1 and 4 into vertical columns. So vertically, around the 1's position (row4, column7), there would be 5s above and below. Similarly, around the 4 (row4, column10), the 5s (from column9) would be vertically aligned.\n\n- Row6 has 2,5,5,5. The horizontal 5s after the 2 would become vertical below and above the 2.\n\n- Row9 has 5,2. The 5 would be vertical around the 2.\n\n- Row11 has 4,5,1. The 5 between 4 and 1 would become vertical.\n\n- Row15 has a 1; if there are adjacent numbers, they would be rotated.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, I'll have to approximate.\n\nApplying this, the test output would have vertical 5s in columns corresponding to where the horizontal clusters were, around the central elements.\n\nFor example, the 5s in row4, columns6,8,9 would become vertical in column7 (the 1's column) and column10 (the 4's column). Similarly, the 5s in row6, columns6-8 (5,5,5) would become vertical in column5 (the 2's column).\n\nThis would result in vertical lines of 5s in those columns around the central numbers.\n\nThe final answer should reflect these transformations, with the clusters rotated from horizontal to vertical (or vice versa) around the central elements.",
