        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the input and output pairs and figure out how the input is transformed into the output, then apply that to the test input. Let's start by analyzing the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input has a structure with some numbers (2, 4) arranged in a certain way. The output seems to mirror or reflect parts of the input. For instance, in the input's row 7 (0-indexed maybe?), there's a 4 in position 6 and 8. The output for that row has 4s mirrored around, maybe adding more 2s symmetrically. Similarly, other rows in the output have elements that look like they're mirrored both horizontally and vertically. Like, the original structure is in the middle, and the output adds reflections around it. \n\nIn Example 1, the input has a cluster of 8s and 3s. The output creates a symmetrical pattern by mirroring those clusters. The 8s in the input form a sort of triangle, and the output mirrors them to the left and right, creating a diamond shape. The 3s in the middle remain the same, but the 8s are mirrored. So the pattern here seems to involve reflecting the non-zero elements across the vertical axis, maybe both vertically and horizontally, creating a symmetrical image.\n\nExample 2 has some 8s and 1s. The input's 8s are in a vertical line, and the output reflects them. The 1s at the bottom form a sort of pattern that's then mirrored above them. It looks like the non-zero elements are being duplicated in a symmetrical way, maybe creating a four-way symmetry (mirroring both left-right and up-down).\n\nPutting this together, the pattern seems to involve taking the original input and creating a symmetrical version of it, possibly reflecting the non-zero elements across the vertical and horizontal axes. The output is a combination of the original input and its mirrored counterparts. So, each non-zero element is copied to its mirrored positions relative to the center of the grid. That way, the entire structure becomes symmetric both vertically and horizontally.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's look at the test input. The non-zero elements are 7s and 4s. Let's see where they are. \n\nRows 6 to 13 (assuming 0-based indexing) have the non-zero values. For example, in row 6, there are 7s at positions 5 and 7. In row 8, there's a 7 at position 5 and 7 again, plus a 4 at position 9. Then in row 9, there's a 4 at position 7 and 8, and another 4 at position 10. Row 10 has a 4 at position 8. Row 11 has 4s at 8 and 9. Rows 12 and 13 have a 4 at position 7.\n\nFollowing the pattern, we need to mirror these elements both horizontally and vertically. Let's see. For each non-zero element, we need to place copies in positions that are mirrored across the central vertical line and the central horizontal line of the grid.\n\nWait, but the grid in the test input is 15x15 (since there are 15 rows each with 15 elements). The center would be at row 7 (0-based) and column 7. So each element at (x, y) should be mirrored to (x, 14 - y) for vertical mirroring and (14 - x, y) for horizontal mirroring? Or perhaps the pattern is to mirror each quadrant. Alternatively, maybe the output is the original structure plus three mirrored copies, creating a symmetrical pattern in all four quadrants.\n\nLooking back at the training examples: in Example 0, the input's structure is in the lower middle, and the output mirrors it upwards and adds symmetrical parts. For instance, the original 4s are in the middle rows, and the output adds mirrored 2s around them. So perhaps the pattern is to take each cluster and mirror it across both axes, creating a symmetrical pattern in all four quadrants.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 4s are in rows 7 and 9. In the output, those 4s are mirrored upwards and downwards. For instance, row 7's 4s are at 6 and 8. The mirrored rows (like row 9 in the output) have 4s in mirrored positions. Also, the 2s from lower rows are mirrored in upper rows. So the output is the original structure plus its reflection across the vertical axis, and then those two parts are mirrored across the horizontal axis. So it's like creating a four-way symmetry.\n\nSo, for the test input, the 7s and 4s are in certain positions. We need to mirror them in all four quadrants. Let's map each non-zero element to its mirrored positions.\n\nFor example, take the 7 in row 6, column 5. The vertical mirror would be column (14 - 5) = 9 (since there are 15 columns, index 0-14). The horizontal mirror would be row (14 -6) = 8. Then the four positions would be (6,5), (6,9), (8,5), (8,9). Similarly, for the 7 in row 6, column 7, the mirrored positions would be (6,7), (6,7) since it's the center column (if 15 columns, the center is 7). Wait, no: for a 15-column grid, the center is at 7 (indices 0-14). So mirroring position (x, y) would be (x, 14 - y) and (14 - x, y), and (14 -x, 14 -y). So each element is mirrored in all four quadrants.\n\nSo for each non-zero element at (x, y), we place copies at (x, 14 - y), (14 - x, y), and (14 - x, 14 - y). But in the training examples, sometimes the mirrored positions are added even if they didn't exist in the original. So the output includes all four positions for each non-zero element.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0. Take the original row 7 (index 7) where there's 4 at column 6 and 8. The mirrored positions would be:\n\nOriginal: (7,6) and (7,8). Wait, but columns 6 and 8 are symmetric around column 7 (since 14 -6 =8). So (7,6) and (7,8) are mirrors of each other. Then, mirrored across the horizontal axis (row 14 -7=7, since there are 14 rows?), wait the input in example 0 has 14 rows (0-13). Wait, each example's input is a list of rows. Example 0's input has 14 rows (each row has 14 elements). So for Example 0, the center row would be between 6 and 7 (since 14 rows, 0-13). So vertical mirroring would be row 13 - x. So for a 14x14 grid, the vertical center is between rows 6 and 7, so row x's mirror is 13 -x. Similarly, columns are 14 elements, so column y's mirror is 13 -y.\n\nSo, for example, in Example 0's input, the 4 in row 7, column 6 would have mirrors at row 7, column 13-6=7? Wait, 13-6=7. So column 6 and 7 are symmetric? Wait, 14 columns (0-13). So the center is between columns 6 and 7. So mirroring column y would be 13 - y. So for column 6, mirror is 7. For column 7, mirror is 6. So in the input's row 7, column 6 and 8 are 4 and 4. Wait, that's already symmetric. But in the output, there's also 4 in row 9 (13-7=6?), but perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by reflecting the original pattern both vertically and horizontally, then combining. So the original pattern is in one quadrant, and the mirrored versions are in the other three quadrants. But looking at Example 0's output, the original input's structure is in the lower part, and the output adds the mirrored structure above. So perhaps it's a vertical mirror. But in the output, rows 10, 11, 12, 13 have elements that are mirrored from the input's rows 3-6. For example, input row 3 is [0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output row 3 is similar but with added 2s. Hmm, perhaps I need to look for a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a combination of the original input and its horizontal and vertical reflections. For instance, the output in Example 0 has the original input's elements plus their reflections. For example, the 2s in row 3 (input) are present, and there are additional 2s in mirrored positions. But it's not a straightforward mirror. Maybe the pattern is to take the original and add reflections along both axes, creating a symmetric output where each non-zero element is present in all four quadrants.\n\nAnother approach: in Example 0, the output's rows 3-6 and 10-13 seem to form a symmetric pattern. The original input's structure is in rows 3-9, and the output mirrors rows 3-6 into rows 10-13. For instance, row 3 in the input has 2s at columns 3 and 6. The output row 3 has 2s at 3, 6, 9, and 12 (since 3 and 6 mirrored would be 8 and 11, but perhaps the example uses a different mirroring). Wait, maybe each element is duplicated symmetrically in the output. For example, in Example 0's input row 3: columns 3 and 6 have 2s. The output row 3 has 2s at 3, 6, 9 (mirror of 3 would be 13-3=10?), perhaps not. Alternatively, the output for row 3 has 2s at 3,6,9, and 12, which are spaced 3 apart. Hmm, but 3 and 9 would sum to 12 (since 3 + 9 =12, but 14 columns, so 13-3=10). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that for each non-zero element in the input, the output places four copies of it: original position, mirrored horizontally, mirrored vertically, and mirrored both. For example, for a position (x,y), the output has elements at (x,y), (x, width-1 -y), (height-1 -x, y), (height-1 -x, width-1 -y).\n\nIn Example 0, the input is 14x14. So height and width are 14, indices 0-13. So for each element in (x,y), the mirrored positions would be (x,13-y), (13-x,y), (13-x,13-y). So, for example, if the input has a 2 at (3,3), the output would have 2s at (3,3), (3,10), (10,3), (10,10). Let's check Example 0's input. In row 3 (x=3), columns 3 and 6 have 2s. In the output, row 3 has 2s at 3,6,9,12. Wait, 13-3=10, so mirrored y would be 10. But 3 and 10 sum to 13. So for (3,3), mirrored positions would be (3,10), (10,3), (10,10). But in the output row 3, columns 3,6,9,12 have 2s. Maybe that's a different pattern. Wait, 3 and 9 are 6 apart, but 3+9=12, not 13. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by tiling the original input in a symmetrical manner. For example, the original pattern is placed in the center, and then mirrored left, right, up, and down. But that's a bit vague.\n\nLet's look at another example. In Example 2, the input has a 1 in row 9, columns 2 and 3. The output in row 9 has 1s at columns 2,3,7,8. Wait, columns 2 and 3 in a 12-column grid. The mirror would be 12-1 -y. So for a 12-column grid (indices 0-11), the mirror of column 2 is 9, and column 3 is 8. So original (9,2) and (9,3) would have mirrors at (9,9), (9,8). But the output row 9 in Example 2 has [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0], which is columns 2,3,7,8. So 2 and 3, 7 and 8. 2+8=10, 3+7=10. But 11-2=9, 11-3=8. So maybe the mirrored columns are 8 and 9. But in the output, columns 7 and 8 are 1s. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the original input plus its horizontal flip and vertical flip. So for each non-zero in (x,y), you add (x, mirrored y), (mirrored x, y), and (mirrored x, mirrored y). So each element is in four positions.\n\nIn the test input, which is 15x15 (rows 0-14, columns 0-14). The center is at (7,7). So for any element at (x,y), the mirrored positions would be (x, 14 - y), (14 - x, y), and (14 - x, 14 - y). So each element appears in four quadrants.\n\nSo, let's apply this to the test input. Let's look for non-zero elements:\n\nRow 6: columns 5 and 7 have 7s. So (6,5) and (6,7). Their mirrors would be:\n\nFor (6,5): (6,14-5=9), (14-6=8,5), (8,9).\n\nFor (6,7): (6,14-7=7) which is same as (6,7), (8,7), (8,7). Wait, because 14-6=8. So (6,7) mirrored vertically is (8,7), and mirrored horizontally is (6,7). So (6,7) would be mirrored to (8,7). But since 7 is the center column, mirrored horizontally is same column. So the 7 at (6,7) would be mirrored to (8,7). Similarly, the 7 at (8,5) would have mirrored positions (8,9), (6,5), (6,9). Wait, but the original 7s are at (6,5), (6,7), (8,5), (8,7) (since in row 8, column 5 and 7 are 7s). Wait, in the test input:\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns 5 and 7 have 7s.\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,4,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns 5,7,9 have 7,7,4.\n\nSo, the original 7s are at (6,5), (6,7), (8,5), (8,7). Let's mirror each of these.\n\nFor (6,5):\n\nMirror vertically: (14-6=8,5) \u2192 which is (8,5), which already has a 7.\n\nMirror horizontally: (6,14-5=9) \u2192 (6,9).\n\nMirror both: (8,9).\n\nSo adding 7s at (6,9) and (8,9). But in row 6, column 9 is 0 in input, so output should have 7 there. Similarly, row 8, column 9 is 4 in input, so maybe that's part of another element.\n\nWait, but in the input, row 8, column 9 has a 4, but we're mirroring the 7s. So the 4s would be handled separately.\n\nSo for each non-zero element, regardless of their value, we mirror them in all four quadrants. So the 7s would be mirrored, and the 4s would be mirrored as well.\n\nSo, let's take all non-zero elements in the test input:\n\n- Row 6: columns 5 (7), 7 (7)\n- Row 7: column 6 (7)\n- Row 8: columns 5 (7), 7 (7), 9 (4)\n- Row 9: columns 7 (4), 8 (4), 10 (4)\n- Row 10: column 8 (4)\n- Row 11: columns 8 (4), 9 (4)\n- Row 12: column 7 (4)\n- Row 13: column 7 (4)\n\nNow, for each of these positions, we need to mirror them across both axes. Let's take each coordinate and generate the four positions.\n\nFor example, take (6,5) with value 7:\n\nMirror vertically (y-axis): (6, 14-5=9) \u2192 (6,9)\n\nMirror horizontally (x-axis): (14-6=8,5) \u2192 (8,5)\n\nMirror both: (8,9)\n\nSo we place 7s at (6,5), (6,9), (8,5), (8,9).\n\nBut in the input, (8,5) already has a 7, so in the output, those positions would have 7s.\n\nSimilarly, the 7 at (6,7):\n\nMirror vertically: (6,14-7=7) \u2192 same as original (since 14-7=7 for column 7)\n\nMirror horizontally: (14-6=8,7) \u2192 (8,7)\n\nMirror both: (8,7) again.\n\nSo the 7s at (6,7) and (8,7) would be mirrored to each other. So in the output, these positions will remain 7s.\n\nNext, the 7 at (8,7) \u2192 same as above.\n\nNow, the 7 at (8,5) is mirrored to (8,9) and (6,5), etc.\n\nNow, let's handle the 4s:\n\nRow 8, column 9 (4):\n\nOriginal position (8,9).\n\nMirror vertically: (8,14-9=5) \u2192 (8,5) (already a 7, but since 4 is different, maybe this is an error, but according to the pattern, we should mirror regardless of existing values. Wait, but the pattern in the training examples seems to mirror the values. For instance, in Example 1, the 8s are mirrored even if overlapping with other numbers. So in the test input, mirroring the 4s would overwrite the 7s? Or is there a priority? Or perhaps the mirroring is additive. Hmm. Looking at Example 2, the output has 8s in mirrored positions, but the 1s are mirrored as well. So perhaps each number is mirrored independently, and if mirrored positions overlap, their values are kept. So for example, if a position is mirrored and the original has a different value, both are present. But in the input, each cell has only one value. Wait, in the output, each cell can only have one value, so if two different numbers are mirrored to the same cell, that would be a problem. But in the training examples, this doesn't happen. For instance, in Example 1, the input has 8s and 3s in separate regions, and their mirrors don't overlap. So in the test input, the 7s and 4s might be in different regions, so their mirrors won't overlap. Let's assume that the mirroring is done per number, so 4s are mirrored, and 7s are mirrored, and if their mirrored positions overlap, they would overwrite. But in the test input, perhaps the mirrors of 7s and 4s don't overlap. Let's check.\n\nFor the 4 at (8,9):\n\nMirror vertically: (8,14-9=5) \u2192 (8,5) which has a 7. So this would result in a conflict. But according to the training examples, maybe the numbers are not overwritten, but mirrored regardless. However, in Example 0, the 4s are mirrored, but their mirrored positions also have 4s. So maybe the mirrored cells have the same value as the original. So even if there's a conflict, the latest mirrored value is placed. But perhaps in the test input, the 4 at (8,9) would be mirrored to (8,5), which already has a 7. But according to the pattern, the mirroring takes precedence. So the 4 would be placed there, overwriting the 7. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the pattern is to mirror each value independently, and if there's a conflict, the original value is preserved. Or maybe the numbers are added as part of the pattern, but in the examples, the numbers don't overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to mirror each cluster of numbers, not individual cells. For instance, the entire shape of numbers is mirrored. For example, in Example 1, the cluster of 8s is mirrored to form a diamond. So the 8s are arranged in a certain way, and the mirroring creates a symmetrical structure.\n\nIn the test input, the 7s form a sort of cross or plus sign. The original 7s are in positions (6,5), (6,7), (8,5), (8,7), and (7,6). Wait, row 7 has a 7 at column 6. Let's process that.\n\nRow 7: column 6 (7). Mirror vertically: (7,14-6=8) \u2192 (7,8). Mirror horizontally: (14-7=7,6) \u2192 (7,6). So mirrored positions are (7,8) and (7,6). But (7,6) is original. So the 7 at (7,6) would have mirrors at (7,8), (7,6), (7,6) again. So output would have 7s at (7,6) and (7,8).\n\nThe 7s in row 8, columns 5,7,9: the 7 at (8,9) is part of the mirroring. Wait, no, row 8, column 9 has a 4. So row 8: [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]. So columns 5 and 7 are 7s, column 9 is 4.\n\nSo the 7s in row 8 are columns 5 and 7. Their mirrors would be:\n\nFor (8,5): mirrored to (8,9) and (6,5), (6,9). But (8,9) is a 4, so mirroring the 7 would overwrite it. But according to the pattern, perhaps each number's mirroring is done separately. So 7s are mirrored, then 4s are mirrored. So the 7's mirror would overwrite the 4's original position. But in the training examples, this doesn't happen. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are mirrored, and the 3s are in a different area. So maybe the mirroring is done per number type, but that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, the mirroring is done per cell, regardless of the value. So if a cell has a 7, it's mirrored, and if another cell has a 4, it's mirrored, and if their mirrors overlap, the last one processed would overwrite. But that's not likely. So perhaps the pattern is that each number is mirrored, and their mirrors are added to the output. So the output includes both the original and mirrored numbers, even if they overlap, but in practice, in the training examples, they don't overlap.\n\nBut this might be getting too complicated. Let's try to proceed step by step.\n\nLet's process each non-zero cell in the test input:\n\nFirst, process 7s:\n\n1. (6,5): 7\n   - Mirrors: (6,9), (8,5), (8,9)\n   - Add 7s to these positions.\n\n2. (6,7):7\n   - Mirrors: (6,7) (same), (8,7), (8,7)\n   - So adds 7 at (8,7).\n\n3. (7,6):7\n   - Mirrors: (7,8), (7,6) (same), (7,8), (7,6)\n   - Adds 7 at (7,8).\n\n4. (8,5):7\n   - Mirrors: (8,9), (6,5), (6,9)\n   - Adds 7s at (8,9), (6,5), (6,9). But (6,5) already processed.\n\n5. (8,7):7\n   - Mirrors: (8,7) (same), (6,7), (6,7)\n   - Adds 7 at (6,7).\n\nNow, process 4s:\n\n1. (8,9):4\n   - Mirrors: (8,5), (6,9), (6,5)\n   - Adds 4s at (8,5), (6,9), (6,5). But these positions have 7s from earlier. So would this overwrite? That's a problem. But according to the training examples, the mirroring seems to preserve the original structure. Maybe each value is mirrored, and overlapping positions take the value of the original. Or perhaps the mirroring is done in such a way that the original and mirrored values are the same. But in this case, the 4 at (8,9) is mirrored to (8,5), which already has a 7. This creates a conflict. So perhaps the pattern doesn't involve mirroring different numbers that overlap. Maybe the test input is designed such that the mirrored positions don't conflict. But looking at the test input, maybe the 4s and 7s are in different regions, so their mirrors don't overlap.\n\nWait, let's check the 4s:\n\nRow 8, column 9:4 \u2192 mirrors to (8,5), (6,9), (6,5). But (8,5) is a 7, (6,9) and (6,5) are 7s. So this would conflict. But perhaps this is a mistake in the test input, or maybe the mirroring is done per-number, and overlapping cells are merged. But since the training examples don't have overlapping numbers after mirroring, perhaps the test input is structured in a way that their mirrors don't conflict.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirroring is done only for each individual number. For example, 7s are mirrored, and 4s are mirrored, but not affecting each other. So in the output, each number's pattern is mirrored.\n\nThis seems complicated, but let's proceed.\n\nProcessing 4s:\n\n1. (8,9):4\n   - Mirrors: (8,5), (6,9), (6,5)\n   - Add 4s here. But these positions have 7s. So perhaps this is allowed, and the output will have a mix. But according to the training examples, the output values are consistent. For example, in Example 0, the 4s are mirrored, and the 2s are mirrored. There's no overlap between them. So perhaps in the test input, the 4s are mirrored in a way that their mirrored positions do not overlap with the 7s' mirrored positions.\n\nBut looking at the test input's 4s:\n\nRow 9 has 4s at columns 7,8,10.\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,4,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns 7,8,10 have 4s.\n\nRow 10: column 8 is 4.\n\nRow 11: columns 8 and 9 are 4s.\n\nRow 12: column 7 is 4.\n\nRow 13: column 7 is 4.\n\nLet's process each 4:\n\nFor (9,7):4 \u2192 mirrors to (9,7), (9,7) (same), (5,7), (5,7). Wait, no: (9,7) in a 15-row grid would have mirrored x as 14-9=5. So mirrors are (9,7) \u2192 mirrored vertically: (9,14-7=7 \u2192 same column). Mirrored horizontally: (5,7). And mirrored both: (5,7). So adds 4 at (5,7).\n\nSimilarly, (9,8):4 \u2192 mirrors to (9,6), (5,8), (5,6).\n\n(9,10):4 \u2192 mirrored y is 14-10=4. So mirrors are (9,4), (5,10), (5,4).\n\nRow 10, column 8: (10,8) \u2192 mirrors to (10,6), (4,8), (4,6).\n\nRow 11, columns 8 and 9: (11,8) \u2192 mirrors to (11,6), (3,8), (3,6). (11,9) \u2192 mirrors to (11,5), (3,9), (3,5).\n\nRow 12, column 7: (12,7) \u2192 mirrors to (12,7) (same), (2,7), (2,7).\n\nRow 13, column 7: (13,7) \u2192 mirrors to (13,7) (same), (1,7), (1,7).\n\nSo, after mirroring all 4s, their positions would be in various places. But some of these mirrored positions might overlap with the 7s' mirrored positions. For example, the 4 at (9,7) mirrors to (5,7), which might overlap with a 7's mirror.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Perhaps the correct approach is to mirror each non-zero cell to its four mirrored positions, and then in the output, each of these mirrored positions will have the same value as the original.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll proceed to apply the pattern as observed in the examples. For each non-zero element, create four copies in the output: original, mirrored left-right, mirrored up-down, and both. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFor each non-zero cell (x,y) in the input, the output will have:\n\n- (x,y)\n- (x, 14 - y)\n- (14 - x, y)\n- (14 - x, 14 - y)\n\nSo let's process each non-zero cell:\n\nProcessing 7s:\n\n1. (6,5):7\n   \u2192 (6,5), (6,9), (8,5), (8,9)\n2. (6,7):7\n   \u2192 (6,7), (6,7) (since 14-7=7), (8,7), (8,7)\n3. (7,6):7\n   \u2192 (7,6), (7,8), (7,6), (7,8)\n4. (8,5):7\n   \u2192 (8,5), (8,9), (6,5), (6,9)\n5. (8,7):7\n   \u2192 (8,7), (8,7), (6,7), (6,7)\n\nProcessing 4s:\n\n1. (8,9):4\n   \u2192 (8,9), (8,5), (6,9), (6,5)\n2. (9,7):4\n   \u2192 (9,7), (9,7), (5,7), (5,7)\n3. (9,8):4\n   \u2192 (9,8), (9,6), (5,8), (5,6)\n4. (9,10):4\n   \u2192 (9,10), (9,4), (5,10), (5,4)\n5. (10,8):4\n   \u2192 (10,8), (10,6), (4,8), (4,6)\n6. (11,8):4\n   \u2192 (11,8), (11,6), (3,8), (3,6)\n7. (11,9):4\n   \u2192 (11,9), (11,5), (3,9), (3,5)\n8. (12,7):4\n   \u2192 (12,7), (12,7), (2,7), (2,7)\n9. (13,7):4\n   \u2192 (13,7), (13,7), (1,7), (1,7)\n\nNow, let's compile all these positions:\n\nFor 7s:\n\n- (6,5), (6,9), (8,5), (8,9)\n- (6,7), (8,7)\n- (7,6), (7,8)\n- (8,5), (8,9), (6,5), (6,9) \u2192 duplicates\n- (8,7), (6,7)\n\nFor 4s:\n\n- (8,9), (8,5), (6,9), (6,5)\n- (9,7), (5,7)\n- (9,8), (9,6), (5,8), (5,6)\n- (9,10), (9,4), (5,10), (5,4)\n- (10,8), (10,6), (4,8), (4,6)\n- (11,8), (11,6), (3,8), (3,6)\n- (11,9), (11,5), (3,9), (3,5)\n- (12,7), (2,7)\n- (13,7), (1,7)\n\nBut there's overlap between 7s and 4s in positions like (8,5), (6,9), (6,5), etc. So for example, position (6,5) would have both 7 and 4, which is impossible. This suggests a problem. However, in the training examples, the output only has one number per cell, so perhaps when there's a conflict, the value from the original input is retained, or the last mirrored value takes precedence. But since the examples don't have such cases, it's unclear.\n\nBut perhaps the test input is designed such that the mirrored positions of 7s and 4s don't overlap. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the 7's mirrored positions:\n\n- (6,5), (6,9), (8,5), (8,9)\n- (6,7), (8,7)\n- (7,6), (7,8)\n\nAnd the 4's mirrored positions include:\n\n- (8,5), (6,9), (6,5) from (8,9)\n- (9,7), (5,7)\n- etc.\n\nSo there is overlap. For example, (8,5) is a 7 in the input, but the 4 at (8,9) is mirrored to (8,5). This would create a conflict. But in the training examples, there are no such overlaps, so perhaps the test input expects that we ignore this and mirror each number, leading to overwrites. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirroring is done per-number, meaning that for each number type, you mirror its positions. So 7s are mirrored, and 4s are mirrored, and they don't interfere. But the output would then have both 7s and 4s in their respective mirrored positions, even if overlapping. But since each cell can only have one value, this is impossible, so the pattern must avoid this. Thus, the test input must be designed so that the mirrored positions of different numbers don't overlap.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the 7s and 4s are mirrored in such a way that their mirrored positions don't overlap. Let's hope that's the case.\n\nNow, let's try to construct the output grid.\n\nThe output should have 15 rows, each with 15 elements. Initially filled with 0s, then we add the mirrored elements.\n\nFor 7s:\n\n- Add 7s at:\n\n(6,5), (6,9), (8,5), (8,9)\n\n(6,7), (8,7)\n\n(7,6), (7,8)\n\n(8,5), (8,9) are already covered.\n\nFor 4s:\n\n- Add 4s at:\n\n(8,9), (8,5), (6,9), (6,5) \u2192 but these positions have 7s, so this would overwrite. But according to the training examples, perhaps the output includes all mirrored values, even if conflicting. But this would lead to ambiguity. Since the training examples don't have this, perhaps the test input is designed such that this doesn't happen, and the 4s are mirrored in their own areas.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirroring is done in a way that the 4s are mirrored vertically and horizontally, but their mirrored positions are in different quadrants.\n\nLooking at the 4s in the input:\n\nRow 8, column 9:4 \u2192 mirrored to (8,5), (6,9), (6,5). But (8,5) is a 7. So this 4's mirroring would overwrite the 7. But this seems unlikely. Perhaps the test input has a mistake, or perhaps the pattern is different. Maybe only certain numbers are mirrored. Alternatively, maybe the mirroring is done only once, not for all four quadrants.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirroring is done vertically only or horizontally only.\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the training examples and see how the mirroring is done. For example, in Example 0, the input's 2s are in the lower half, and the output adds mirrored 2s in the upper half. The 4s are mirrored vertically. So it's a vertical mirror. In Example 1, the 8s are mirrored horizontally. So maybe the pattern is to mirror the input vertically and horizontally.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 4s are in rows 7 and 9. In the output, the 4s are mirrored in rows 7 and 9 (same rows), but also mirrored in other rows. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the original input plus its vertical and horizontal reflections. So the output is three times the original: original, vertical flip, horizontal flip, and diagonal flip. But this is a bit unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll proceed to apply the four-way mirroring to each non-zero cell, assuming that overlapping cells are handled by overwriting, and see what the output would look like.\n\nLet's construct the output step by step:\n\nInitialize a 15x15 grid of 0s.\n\nProcess each non-zero cell in the input:\n\nFor 7s:\n\n- (6,5):7 \u2192 set (6,5), (6,9), (8,5), (8,9) to 7.\n\n- (6,7):7 \u2192 set (6,7), (6,7), (8,7), (8,7) to 7.\n\n- (7,6):7 \u2192 set (7,6), (7,8), (7,6), (7,8) to 7.\n\n- (8,5):7 \u2192 set (8,5), (8,9), (6,5), (6,9) to 7.\n\n- (8,7):7 \u2192 set (8,7), (8,7), (6,7), (6,7) to 7.\n\nFor 4s:\n\n- (8,9):4 \u2192 set (8,9), (8,5), (6,9), (6,5) to 4. But these positions already have 7s. So this would overwrite them. But according to the examples, perhaps this is allowed. But in Example 0, the 4s are in mirrored positions without overlap. So this might be a problem.\n\nBut proceeding:\n\n- (9,7):4 \u2192 set (9,7), (9,7), (5,7), (5,7) to 4.\n\n- (9,8):4 \u2192 set (9,8), (9,6), (5,8), (5,6) to 4.\n\n- (9,10):4 \u2192 set (9,10), (9,4), (5,10), (5,4) to 4.\n\n- (10,8):4 \u2192 set (10,8), (10,6), (4,8), (4,6) to 4.\n\n- (11,8):4 \u2192 set (11,8), (11,6), (3,8), (3,6) to 4.\n\n- (11,9):4 \u2192 set (11,9), (11,5), (3,9), (3,5) to 4.\n\n- (12,7):4 \u2192 set (12,7), (12,7), (2,7), (2,7) to 4.\n\n- (13,7):4 \u2192 set (13,7), (13,7), (1,7), (1,7) to 4.\n\nAfter processing all these, the output grid will have 7s and 4s in their respective mirrored positions. However, there are conflicts where both 7 and 4 are supposed to be in the same cell. For example, cell (8,9) is set to 7 by the 7's mirroring and to 4 by the 4's mirroring. This is a problem. But perhaps in the test input's case, such conflicts don't exist. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the input's 4s and 7s, maybe their mirrors don't overlap. For example, the 4s are in rows 8 and below, while the 7s are in rows 6-8. Their mirrors might be in different areas. But in reality, there is overlap, as seen.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption about the pattern might be incorrect. Perhaps the mirroring is done differently. Maybe only a vertical or horizontal mirror, not both.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is the input's reflection across the vertical axis. For example, Example 0's input has structures that are mirrored left-right in the output. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input row 3: columns 3 and 6 have 2s. The output row 3 has 2s at columns 3,6,9,12. 9 is 3 + 6, 12 is 6 +6. This could be a horizontal reflection. For a 14-column grid, the vertical mirror would be column 13 - y. For example, column 3's mirror is 10, because 13-3=10. So in Example 0's output, row 3 has 2s at 3 and 10, but the output shows 2s at 3,6,9,12. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the output is created by taking the input and appending its horizontal and vertical reflections. For example, the original input is in the center, and then mirrored on all four sides. But this would create a larger grid, but the output in the examples has the same size as the input. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the input plus its horizontal and vertical reflections combined into the same grid. For example, each non-zero cell is mirrored across both axes, resulting in four copies. But then the grid size remains the same.\n\nBut how to handle the center cells. For even and odd sizes. The test input is 15x15, which is odd, so the center cell is (7,7). Mirroring a cell at (7,7) would remain the same.\n\nPerhaps the correct pattern is to mirror each non-zero element across both the vertical and horizontal axes, creating four copies (except for those on the axes, which create two copies). So for each cell (x,y), the output has copies at (x, y), (x, 14-y), (14-x, y), and (14-x, 14-y).\n\nApplying this to the test input's 7s and 4s would generate the output.\n\nNow, let's proceed to construct the output grid by applying this mirroring.\n\nAfter applying this, the output should have the following non-zero elements:\n\nFor 7s:\n\nOriginal positions and their mirrors:\n\n(6,5) \u2192 (6,5), (6,9), (8,5), (8,9)\n\n(6,7) \u2192 (6,7), (6,7), (8,7), (8,7) \u2192 same as original.\n\n(7,6) \u2192 (7,6), (7,8), (7,6), (7,8)\n\n(8,5) \u2192 (8,5), (8,9), (6,5), (6,9)\n\n(8,7) \u2192 (8,7), (8,7), (6,7), (6,7)\n\nFor 4s:\n\n(8,9) \u2192 (8,9), (8,5), (6,9), (6,5)\n\n(9,7) \u2192 (9,7), (9,7), (5,7), (5,7)\n\n(9,8) \u2192 (9,8), (9,6), (5,8), (5,6)\n\n(9,10) \u2192 (9,10), (9,4), (5,10), (5,4)\n\n(10,8) \u2192 (10,8), (10,6), (4,8), (4,6)\n\n(11,8) \u2192 (11,8), (11,6), (3,8), (3,6)\n\n(11,9) \u2192 (11,9), (11,5), (3,9), (3,5)\n\n(12,7) \u2192 (12,7), (12,7), (2,7), (2,7)\n\n(13,7) \u2192 (13,7), (13,7), (1,7), (1,7)\n\nNow, compiling all these positions and their values:\n\n7s at:\n\n- (6,5), (6,9), (8,5), (8,9)\n- (6,7), (8,7)\n- (7,6), (7,8)\n\n4s at:\n\n- (8,9), (8,5), (6,9), (6,5) \u2192 these positions also have 7s. Conflict.\n- (9,7), (5,7)\n- (9,8), (9,6), (5,8), (5,6)\n- (9,10), (9,4), (5,10), (5,4)\n- (10,8), (10,6), (4,8), (4,6)\n- (11,8), (11,6), (3,8), (3,6)\n- (11,9), (11,5), (3,9), (3,5)\n- (12,7), (2,7)\n- (13,7), (1,7)\n\nThe conflict in positions (6,5), (6,9), (8,5), (8,9) between 7s and 4s is problematic. But according to the training examples, perhaps the mirroring is done such that each number's pattern is mirrored without overlapping. So maybe the test input's 4s and 7s are arranged such that their mirrors don't conflict, but due to the input provided, they do. This suggests a mistake in my pattern assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirroring is done only vertically or horizontally. Let's consider vertical mirroring (left-right) only. For each non-zero cell (x,y), mirror to (x, 14-y).\n\nFor example, in Example 0, the 2s in row 3, columns 3 and 6 would be mirrored to columns 10 and 7 (since 13-3=10 and 13-6=7). But in Example 0's output, row 3 has 2s at columns 3,6,9,12. So this suggests that vertical mirroring isn't the only operation. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the initial assumption that each non-zero cell is mirrored to all four quadrants, and in case of conflict, the latest value (based on processing order) takes precedence. However, given the examples, this might not be the case, and perhaps the correct approach is to mirror each cell's value to all four quadrants, creating a symmetrical pattern.\n\nThus, the final output will have the mirrored positions filled with the respective values. For the test input, the output would have:\n\n- 7s in their original and mirrored positions.\n- 4s in their original and mirrored positions, possibly overwriting some 7s.\n\nBut since this leads to conflicts, and the examples don't have such cases, I must have made a mistake in the pattern.\n\nLooking back at Example 2's input and output:\n\nInput has 1s in rows 9-11. The output mirrors them upwards. For instance, the 1s in row 9 are mirrored to row 3 (assuming 0-based). The 1s in row 10 are mirrored to row 2, etc. So the pattern is vertical mirroring. The output includes the original and its vertical reflection. Similarly, in Example 1, the 8s are mirrored horizontally.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is to mirror the input vertically (up-down) and horizontally (left-right), creating a symmetrical pattern in all four quadrants. \n\nFor Example 0's input, the output is the original plus vertical and horizontal mirrors. So the original is in the lower middle, and the mirrors are above and to the sides.\n\nApplying this to the test input: the original structure is in the middle. Mirroring it vertically and horizontally would create copies in all four quadrants.\n\nTo do this, the input is split into quadrants, and each non-zero cell is mirrored to the other three quadrants.\n\nBut how to split the grid into quadrants when the size is odd. For a 15x15 grid, the center is at (7,7). So each cell (x,y) is mirrored to:\n\n- (x, 14 - y) \u2192 left-right mirror.\n- (14 - x, y) \u2192 up-down mirror.\n- (14 - x, 14 - y) \u2192 diagonal mirror.\n\nThus, each non-zero cell is mirrored to four positions unless it's on the center lines.\n\nApplying this to the test input's 7s and 4s:\n\nProcessing 7s:\n\nFor each 7 in (x,y), add 7 to:\n\n- (x, 14 - y)\n- (14 - x, y)\n- (14 - x, 14 - y)\n\nFor example, (6,5) \u2192 mirrors to (6,9), (8,5), (8,9).\n\n(6,7) \u2192 mirrors to (6,7) (same), (8,7), (8,7).\n\nSimilarly for other 7s.\n\nProcessing 4s:\n\nFor each 4 in (x,y), add 4 to:\n\n- (x, 14 - y)\n- (14 - x, y)\n- (14 - x, 14 - y)\n\nFor example, (8,9) \u2192 mirrors to (8,5), (6,9), (6,5).\n\n(9,7) \u2192 mirrors to (9,7), (5,7), (5,7).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, the output will have these mirrored positions. Even if there are overlaps, each cell will have the value from the last mirrored cell. But since the input is designed such that the 7s and 4s are in different areas, their mirrors may not overlap. \n\nAssuming this is the case, the output will have the mirrored 7s and 4s in their respective positions.\n\nNow, let's construct the output step by step.\n\nFirst, initialize a 15x15 grid of 0s.\n\nProcess each 7:\n\n1. (6,5) \u2192 add 7 to (6,5), (6,9), (8,5), (8,9).\n\n2. (6,7) \u2192 add 7 to (6,7), (6,7), (8,7), (8,7).\n\n3. (7,6) \u2192 add 7 to (7,6), (7,8), (7,6), (7,8).\n\n4. (8,5) \u2192 add 7 to (8,5), (8,9), (6,5), (6,9).\n\n5. (8,7) \u2192 add 7 to (8,7), (8,7), (6,7), (6,7).\n\nProcess each 4:\n\n1. (8,9) \u2192 add 4 to (8,9), (8,5), (6,9), (6,5).\n\n2. (9,7) \u2192 add 4 to (9,7), (9,7), (5,7), (5,7).\n\n3. (9,8) \u2192 add 4 to (9,8), (9,6), (5,8), (5,6).\n\n4. (9,10) \u2192 add 4 to (9,10), (9,4), (5,10), (5,4).\n\n5. (10,8) \u2192 add 4 to (10,8), (10,6), (4,8), (4,6).\n\n6. (11,8) \u2192 add 4 to (11,8), (11,6), (3,8), (3,6).\n\n7. (11,9) \u2192 add 4 to (11,9), (11,5), (3,9), (3,5).\n\n8. (12,7) \u2192 add 4 to (12,7), (12,7), (2,7), (2,7).\n\n9. (13,7) \u2192 add 4 to (13,7), (13,7), (1,7), (1,7).\n\nNow, note that some positions are overwritten. For example, (6,5) was set to 7 by the 7's mirroring, but the 4 at (8,9) also mirrors to (6,5), setting it to 4. Similarly for (6,9), (8,5), (8,9), etc. This suggests that in the output, these positions will have the value of the last processed element. But since the training examples don't have such overlaps, this indicates a problem with the pattern assumption.\n\nHowever, given the time constraints, I'll proceed to create the output with these positions, assuming that each mirrored cell is filled regardless of previous values.\n\nNow, let's assemble the output rows:\n\nStarting from row 0 to row 14.\n\nLooking for non-zero elements:\n\nRow 1:\n\n- (1,7) \u2192 4 (from 13,7 mirror)\n\nRow 2:\n\n- (2,7) \u21924 (from 12,7 mirror)\n\nRow 3:\n\n- (3,5), (3,6), (3,8), (3,9) \u21924 (from 11,9 and 11,8 mirrors)\n\nRow 4:\n\n- (4,6), (4,8) \u21924 (from 10,8 mirror)\n\nRow 5:\n\n- (5,4), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,10) \u21924 (from 9,10,9,8,9,7 mirrors)\n\nRow 6:\n\n- (6,5), (6,7), (6,9) \u21927 and 4 (from 7s and 4s)\n- (6,6) \u21924 (from 9,8 mirror:9,6 \u2192 row6, column6?)\n\nWait, (9,8) mirrors to (9,6) (since 14-8=6), which is in row9, column6. But that's a different row. So for (9,8) \u2192 mirrors to (9,6), (5,8), (5,6). So row9, column6 is 4.\n\nBut how does this affect row6? Not directly. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me list all non-zero positions:\n\n7s:\n\n- (6,5), (6,9), (8,5), (8,9)\n- (6,7), (8,7)\n- (7,6), (7,8)\n\n4s:\n\n- (1,7), (2,7)\n- (3,5), (3,6), (3,8), (3,9)\n- (4,6), (4,8)\n- (5,4), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,10)\n- (6,5), (6,9), (8,5), (8,9)\n- (9,4), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,10)\n- (10,6), (10,8)\n- (11,5), (11,6), (11,8), (11,9)\n- (12,7)\n- (13,7)\n\nBut many of these 4 positions overlap with 7s. For example, (6,5), (6,9), (8,5), (8,9) have both 7 and 4. This is conflicting. But according to the training examples, this shouldn't happen. So perhaps the initial pattern assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirroring is done for each number cluster, and the 4s are mirrored in their own cluster and the 7s in theirs, without overlapping.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the output will have the 7s mirrored in a diamond shape and the 4s mirrored in another pattern.\n\nBut without more time to analyze, I'll proceed to create the output as per the four-way mirroring, even with overlaps, and assume that the final answer is as follows.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples, then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by analyzing the examples one by one to identify the underlying rule.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input seems to have some numbers (2s and 4s) arranged in a certain way. The output has more numbers, and they are symmetrically placed. For instance, the 2s in the input are mirrored both horizontally and vertically in the output. The 4s in the input (like in row 7) are also mirrored. Wait, maybe the pattern involves reflecting the original elements across both the vertical and horizontal axes, creating a symmetrical pattern. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the original elements are around the middle rows. The output has those elements duplicated in a symmetrical way. For example, the row with [0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] becomes in the output [0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,2,0,0]. So it looks like each element is mirrored around the center. The original elements are in the first half, and the output mirrors them in the second half. Similarly, the 4s in row 7 of the input are mirrored in the output, creating a cross or diamond shape.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a triangle of 8s and some 3s. The output mirrors the 8s both on the left and right sides. The original 8s in the middle are surrounded by mirrored versions. The 3s in the middle are kept as is, but the 8s are expanded symmetrically. So the pattern here might be to take the original elements and mirror them in all four quadrants or symmetrically around the center.\n\nExample 2's input has an 8-shaped structure and a 1-shaped structure. The output mirrors the 1s both above and below the original position, creating a diamond-like pattern. The 8s in the middle are preserved, but the 1s are expanded into a symmetrical diamond. So the transformation here is creating a symmetrical reflection of the original elements, perhaps both vertically and horizontally, leading to a more complex, expanded structure.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern seems to involve creating a symmetrical version of the original elements. The output grids are larger (double the size?), but looking at the examples, the row counts don't exactly double. Wait, in Example 0, the input is 14x14, and the output is also 14x14. So maybe the symmetry is within the same grid dimensions. Hmm, maybe the original elements are mirrored around the vertical and horizontal midlines. Let's check the dimensions.\n\nIn Example 0, the input is 14 rows. The middle rows are around row 7 (0-based index 6.5). The output seems to have elements mirrored both left-right and up-down. So each element in the original is copied to positions mirrored across both axes. For example, if there's a 2 at position (3,3) in the input (assuming rows and columns start at 0), then it would also be placed at (3,10) (mirrored over vertical midline), and similarly mirrored vertically. But in the output, the 2s are appearing in positions that are symmetric around the center.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is to take each non-zero element and mirror it across both the vertical and horizontal center lines of the grid. So each non-zero cell is part of a symmetrical quartet in the output. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the row [0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (row 3, 0-based index 3). The vertical midline is between column 6 and 7 (since there are 14 columns). So the 2 at column 3 would be mirrored to column 10 (since 14-3-1=10). Similarly, the 2 at column 6 would be mirrored to column 7 (14-6-1=7). But in the output row 3, the elements are [0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,2,0,0]. So columns 3,6,8,11. Wait, 3 and 10 (since 14-3-1=10) would be columns 3 and 10. But in the output, the 2s are at 3,6,8,11. Hmm, maybe the mirroring is different. Alternatively, maybe each non-zero element is copied to three other positions: mirrored vertically, mirrored horizontally, and mirrored both. So for a cell (i,j), the mirrored cells would be (i, width-1-j), (height-1-i,j), and (height-1-i, width-1-j). That would create a cross or diamond symmetry.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output row 3: the original input has 2s at columns 3 and 6. The output has 2s at columns 3,6,8,11. For a 14-column grid, width is 14. So column 3's mirror is 14-1-3=10, which is column 10 (index 10, which is the 11th position). Similarly, column 6's mirror is 14-1-6=7. Wait, in the output row 3, there's a 2 at column 8 and 11. Wait, 8 is beyond 7. Maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grid is split into quadrants, and each non-zero element is replicated in all four quadrants. For example, if a non-zero is in the top-left quadrant, it's mirrored to the top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right. But how exactly?\n\nAnother approach: Let's compare the input and output of Example 0. The input has elements in certain positions, and the output seems to have those elements reflected both vertically and horizontally. For example, in the input's row 7 (0-based index 7), there's a 4 at column 6 and 8. In the output's row 7, the 4s are at columns 6 and 8 (original positions), and also mirrored in the lower rows. Wait, maybe the output is the input plus its mirror images in vertical and horizontal axes, creating a symmetrical pattern in all four quadrants.\n\nWait, the output in Example 0 has more rows than the input. Wait no, in Example 0, both input and output are 14 rows. Wait, the input has 14 rows and the output also has 14 rows. So the mirroring must be within the same grid size. For example, the original elements are mirrored both horizontally and vertically around the center.\n\nBut how exactly? Let's take a specific cell. Suppose there's a cell at (i,j) in the input. Then in the output, it would also appear at (i, width-1-j), (height-1-i, j), and (height-1-i, width-1-j). So each non-zero cell is copied to three other positions. That would explain the symmetry in the output.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0. Take the 2 in row 3, column 3 (0-based indices). The mirrored positions would be column 10 (14-1-3=10), row 10 (14-1-3=10). So the cell (3,3) would be mirrored to (3,10), (10,3), (10,10). Looking at the output of Example 0, row 3 (input row 3) has 2s at columns 3,6,8,11. Wait, maybe the original cell is at (3,3) and (3,6). Then their mirrors would be (3,10) and (3,7). Wait, 14-1-3=10, 14-1-6=7. So in output row 3, columns 3,6,7,10 would have 2s, but in the output row 3, columns 3,6,8,11. Hmm, that doesn't align. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mirroring is not across the entire grid but around a central point. For example, if the grid is even-sized, then the center is between rows and columns. So for a 14x14 grid, the center is between rows 6 and 7 (indices 6 and 7) and columns 6 and 7. So a cell (i,j) is mirrored to (13 - i, j) and (i, 13 -j), etc. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 3 (i=3), column 3 (j=3). The mirrored positions would be (13-3=10,3) and (3,13-3=10), and (10,10). So output rows 3 and 10 would have 2s at columns 3 and 10. Looking at Example 0's output, row 3 has 2s at 3,6,8,11. Hmm, this doesn't match. Maybe the mirroring is different. Alternatively, maybe it's a reflection along both axes, creating four copies.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is to take the original elements and create a symmetrical version by reflecting them across the vertical and horizontal midlines, but in a way that the original and mirrored elements are all present. So for each non-zero element in the input, the output has that element plus its mirror across the vertical midline, its mirror across the horizontal midline, and the mirror across both. So four copies in total if all mirrors are unique.\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose there's a 2 at (3,3) in the input. Then in the output, it would be at (3,3), (3,10) (mirror vertical), (10,3) (mirror horizontal), and (10,10) (mirror both). So in the output, these four positions would have 2s. Let's check Example 0's output row 3. In row 3, there are 2s at columns 3,6,8,11. Wait, column 3 and 10 (which is index 10, 11th position?) Maybe the columns are 0-based. Let's clarify.\n\nWait, in the input for Example 0, each row has 14 elements. So columns are 0-13. The vertical midline is between columns 6 and 7. So mirroring a position j would be 13 - j. For example, j=3 would mirror to 10 (13-3=10). Similarly, for rows, mirroring row i would be 13 - i. So input row 3 (i=3) would mirror to row 10 (13-3=10).\n\nIn Example 0's output, row 3 has 2s at columns 3,6,8,11. Wait, columns 3 and 10 (mirror) would be positions 3 and 10. But 3 and 10 are 7 positions apart. But in the output row 3, columns 3 and 6 (distance 3), 8 and 11 (distance 3). Hmm, perhaps there's another pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is creating a rotational symmetry. For example, rotating the original elements 180 degrees and combining with the original. But that might not explain all cases.\n\nLet's look at another example. Example 2's input has a 1 in row 9 (0-based) column 2 and 3, and in row 10 column 1 and 3, and row 11 column 2. The output for those rows has mirrored 1s above and below. For example, row 3 has 1 at column 2, row 9 has 1s, row 10 has 1s mirrored, etc. It seems like the output is creating a diamond shape by mirroring the original elements vertically and horizontally.\n\nWait, in Example 2's output, the 1s form a diamond shape. The original input's 1s are in rows 9,10,11. The output adds mirrored versions in rows 3,4,5 (earlier rows) and 9,10,11 (original) as well as perhaps rows 0-2. Wait, the output has 12 rows. Let me count: input has 12 rows (0-11), output also has 12 rows. So for each element in the input, it's mirrored both vertically (up-down) and horizontally (left-right), creating a symmetrical diamond.\n\nAnother possibility is that the pattern is to create a reflection of the original elements across the vertical axis and then across the horizontal axis, effectively creating a symmetrical pattern in all four quadrants.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a combination of the original elements and their reflections in all four directions. For example, each non-zero element is reflected left-right, up-down, and both, leading to four copies.\n\nBut let's take a concrete example from Example 0. The input row 7 (index 7) has [0,0,0,2,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]. The output row 7 is [0,0,0,2,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,2,0,0]. Wait, there's a 4 at column 6 and 8 (original positions) and a 2 at column 11. So perhaps the 2s from other parts are mirrored here. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLet me think of the overall approach. The output seems to have more elements than the input, arranged symmetrically. The key is to figure out how the input elements are being mirrored or expanded. Another angle: in each example, the output seems to be a symmetrical expansion of the input. For instance, in Example 1, the 8s in the input are surrounded by more 8s in the output, creating a diamond shape. Similarly, the 3s are in the center and remain there. So maybe the pattern is to take each non-zero element and create a symmetrical pattern around it, expanding in all directions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each non-zero element is the center of a cross or diamond, and the output places numbers in a diamond shape around each original element. For example, in Example 0, the 2s might form a diamond around their original positions.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, there's a 2 at row 3, column 3. The output has 2s around that position in a symmetrical way. For example, in row 3, columns 3,6,8,11. Maybe each 2 is generating a diamond pattern in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-zero element is part of a certain structure that's being replicated. For example, the number 2 forms a certain shape that is then mirrored, while 4s form a different shape.\n\nAnother observation: the output often has the same numbers as the input, but arranged in a symmetrical way. For instance, in Example 0, the 4s in the input are mirrored in the output. Similarly, in Example 1, the 8s are mirrored. The numbers themselves might dictate the direction or distance of the mirroring. For example, perhaps the number's value indicates how many times it's mirrored or the distance.\n\nAlternatively, the number itself isn't affecting the pattern; it's just that the positions of non-zero elements are being mirrored.\n\nLooking at Example 2's test input, which has 7s and 4s. The output should mirror those. The test input's 7s are in rows 6, 8. The 4s are in rows 8,9,10,11,12,13. So applying the same mirroring logic as the examples, we need to mirror these elements across both the vertical and horizontal axes.\n\nFor instance, a 7 at (row 6, column 5) would be mirrored to (row 6, column 9) (since 15 columns, so 14 -5 =9?), but let's check. The test input has 15 columns (since the test input rows are lists of 15 zeros). Wait, the test input has 15 elements per row. So the vertical midline is at column 7 (0-based index 7). So a cell at column j would mirror to 14 - j (since indices go 0-14). Similarly, rows are 15 rows (0-14), so a row i would mirror to 14 - i.\n\nSo for a 7 in row 6, column 5, its vertical mirror would be column 9 (14-5=9), and its horizontal mirror would be row 8 (14-6=8). Then the mirror of both would be (8,9). So four positions: (6,5), (6,9), (8,5), (8,9). Similarly, the 7 at row 6, column 7 would mirror to (6,7), (6,7) again (since 14-7=7), and mirrored rows would be 8, so (8,7). Wait, but the input has a 7 at row 6, column 7. Its mirrors would be (6,7) (same), (8,7), and (8,7). So duplicates. So the output would have 7s at (6,5), (6,9), (8,5), (8,9) from the original 7s, and also the 7 at (6,7) would have mirrors at (6,7), (8,7).\n\nSimilarly, the 4s in the test input: for example, the 4 in row 8, column 9. Its mirrors would be column 5 (14-9=5), row 6 (14-8=6). So (8,9) mirrors to (8,5), (6,9), and (6,5).\n\nSo applying this to the test input, each non-zero element is mirrored to three other positions (unless it's on the midline, in which case it's mirrored fewer times).\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that each non-zero element in the input is mirrored across the vertical and horizontal midlines, creating up to three additional copies in the output. This results in a symmetrical pattern in all four quadrants of the grid.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nOriginal elements:\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns 5 and 7 have 7s.\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column 6 has 7.\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,4,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns 5,7,9 have 7,7,4.\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,4,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns 7,8,10 have 4,4,4.\nRow 10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column 8 has 4.\nRow 11: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns 8,9 have 4.\nRow 12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column 7 has 4.\nRow 13: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column 7 has 4.\n\nEach of these non-zero elements needs to be mirrored across both vertical and horizontal midlines.\n\nFor example, the 7 at (6,5):\n\nVertical mirror: column 14-5=9 \u2192 (6,9)\nHorizontal mirror: row 14-6=8 \u2192 (8,5)\nBoth mirrors: (8,9)\nSo four positions: (6,5), (6,9), (8,5), (8,9).\n\nSimilarly, the 7 at (6,7):\n\nVertical mirror: 14-7=7 \u2192 same column.\nHorizontal mirror: row 8 \u2192 (8,7)\nSo positions: (6,7), (8,7).\n\nThe 7 in row 7, column 6:\n\nVertical mirror: 14-6=8 \u2192 (7,8)\nHorizontal mirror: row 14-7=7 \u2192 same row.\nSo positions: (7,6), (7,8).\n\nThe 7 in row 8, column5:\n\nMirrors to (6,5), (6,9), (8,9), but wait, original is (8,5). Wait, no: for (8,5), vertical mirror is 14-5=9 \u2192 column 9. Horizontal mirror is 14-8=6 \u2192 row 6. So mirrors are (8,9), (6,5), (6,9). So original (8,5) and three mirrors.\n\nSimilarly, the 4s:\n\nTake the 4 at row8, column9:\n\nVertical mirror: 14-9=5 \u2192 column5.\nHorizontal mirror: 14-8=6 \u2192 row6.\nSo mirrors: (8,5), (6,9), (6,5).\n\nSo each 4 will be mirrored similarly.\n\nNow, applying this to all non-zero elements in the test input:\n\nLet's go row by row and process each non-zero:\n\nRow 6:\n- (6,5) \u2192 7 \u2192 mirrors at (6,9), (8,5), (8,9)\n- (6,7) \u21927 \u2192 mirrors at (6,7) (same), (8,7)\n\nRow7:\n- (7,6) \u21927 \u2192 mirrors at (7,8), (7,6) (same row), (same column?)\n\nWait, row7, column6. Vertical mirror is 14-6=8 \u2192 column8. Horizontal mirror is 14-7=7 \u2192 row7. So mirrors are (7,8), (7,6) (original), and (7,6) again? No. Wait, horizontal mirror is row14-7=7 \u2192 same row. So the mirrors are vertical only. So (7,6) \u2192 (7,8). Then horizontal mirror is same row, so no change. So the mirrors are (7,6) and (7,8).\n\nRow8:\n- (8,5) \u21927 \u2192 mirrors at (8,9), (6,5), (6,9)\n- (8,7) \u21927 \u2192 mirrors at (8,7) (same column), (6,7)\n- (8,9) \u21924 \u2192 mirrors at (8,5), (6,9), (6,5)\n\nRow9:\n- (9,7) \u21924 \u2192 mirrors at (9,7) (same column?), no, column7's mirror is 14-7=7 \u2192 same. So vertical mirror is same column. Horizontal mirror is 14-9=5 \u2192 row5. So mirrors are (5,7), (9,7) (original), and (5,7) again? Wait, original (9,7) \u2192 vertical mirror is (9,7), horizontal mirror is (5,7), and both mirrors would be (5,7). So only two positions: (9,7) and (5,7).\n- (9,8) \u21924 \u2192 vertical mirror is 14-8=6 \u2192 (9,6). Horizontal mirror is 14-9=5 \u2192 row5. So mirrors: (5,6), (5,8), (9,6), (9,8).\nWait, original (9,8): vertical mirror is (9,6), horizontal mirror is (5,8), and both mirrors would be (5,6).\n- (9,10) \u21924 \u2192 vertical mirror is 14-10=4 \u2192 (9,4). Horizontal mirror is (5,10). So mirrors: (9,4), (5,10), (5,4).\n\nRow10:\n- (10,8) \u21924 \u2192 vertical mirror is 14-8=6 \u2192 (10,6). Horizontal mirror is 14-10=4 \u2192 row4. So mirrors: (4,6), (10,6), (4,8), (10,8).\n\nRow11:\n- (11,8) \u21924 \u2192 vertical mirror is 14-8=6 \u2192 (11,6). Horizontal mirror is 14-11=3 \u2192 row3. So mirrors: (3,6), (11,6), (3,8), (11,8).\n- (11,9) \u21924 \u2192 vertical mirror is 14-9=5 \u2192 (11,5). Horizontal mirror is 14-11=3 \u2192 row3. So mirrors: (3,5), (3,9), (11,5), (11,9).\n\nRow12:\n- (12,7) \u21924 \u2192 vertical mirror is 14-7=7 \u2192 same column. Horizontal mirror is 14-12=2 \u2192 row2. So mirrors: (2,7), (12,7).\n\nRow13:\n- (13,7) \u21924 \u2192 vertical mirror is same column. Horizontal mirror is 14-13=1 \u2192 row1. So mirrors: (1,7), (13,7).\n\nNow, compiling all these mirrored positions along with the original ones, and ensuring they are placed correctly.\n\nThis will result in a symmetrical grid where each non-zero element is reflected across both axes. For example, the 7s in the original input will create a diamond shape, and the 4s will form their own symmetrical patterns.\n\nThe final output will have the original elements plus their mirrored counterparts, creating a symmetrical pattern. Each non-zero in the input generates up to three additional elements in the output, leading to a more complex, symmetrical grid.",
