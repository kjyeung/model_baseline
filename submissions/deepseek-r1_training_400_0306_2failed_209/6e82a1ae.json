        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples. Let's start by looking at the examples closely.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. The input has 5s, and the output has numbers like 1, 2, 3. Hmm. Maybe each cluster of 5s is being labeled with a different number based on some criteria. But how?\n\nIn Example 0's output, the top-right cluster of 5s in the input (like rows 1, 2, 3) becomes 1s. Then the bottom part, like row 5, 6, 7 has 2s and 3s. Wait, maybe it's based on the region of the grid? Like the upper parts get 1, lower parts get 2 or 3? Not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the second example's input and output. In the input, there are clusters of 5s. In the output, different numbers replace them. For instance, in the output of Example 1, the upper clusters (like row 2) have 2 and 3, and the lower ones (row 8 and 9) have 1s. Hmm. Maybe the numbers are assigned based on vertical position? Like higher rows get higher numbers?\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the 5s are in various positions. The output replaces some with 1, 2, 3. For example, in row 0 of the input, there's a 5 in the last column. But in the output, row 6, 7, 8 (the ones starting with 5s) become 1s, and some others like in row 1 become 3 and 2. So perhaps the numbering is based on the vertical position, but inverted? Like the lower the cluster, the lower the number. Let me check the training examples again.\n\nTake Example 0: The output's 1s are in rows 1,2,3 (upper part), 2s and 3s are lower. Wait, in row 5 of the output, the last element is 2. Then rows 6,7,8 have 3, 3, and 2. So maybe it's not a simple vertical order. Maybe it's based on the order in which the clusters are encountered when scanning the grid in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers represent the order of clusters when processed from bottom to top. For instance, the bottom-most cluster gets 1, then the next up gets 2, etc. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the bottom part (rows 5-9) has 2,3,2. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me see the input clusters. The first input has clusters in upper-middle (rows 1-3), middle-right (row 5-7), and maybe a cluster in rows 7-8 (the 5s on the left). The output labels these as 1,2,3. Maybe the numbers correspond to the order in which clusters are encountered when scanning the grid from top to bottom, left to right. So the first cluster (topmost) is labeled 1, next 2, etc. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first cluster (from top) is the group in rows 1-3, columns 7-8. Then the next cluster is in row 5, column 9, then rows 6-7, columns 5-6 and 9. Then another cluster in row 8, column 4. The output labels these as 1,2,3,2. Hmm, that doesn't fit a simple sequence. Alternatively, perhaps each cluster is assigned a number based on their vertical position. For example, clusters in higher rows get higher numbers. Wait, in Example 2's output, the cluster in row 6-8 (the 5s) becomes 1, which is the lowest number. That cluster is at the bottom. The cluster in row 1-2 (columns 2-3) becomes 3 and 2. So maybe the numbering is from bottom to top. The bottommost cluster is 1, next up is 2, then 3, etc.\n\nLet's check Example 0's output. The bottom clusters: the ones in rows 5-7 (columns 9, then 5-6 and 9 again) are labeled 2 and 3. The upper cluster (rows 1-3) is labeled 1. That might not fit. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe each cluster is assigned a number based on the order they are encountered when scanning the grid from bottom to top, left to right. So starting from the bottom row, scan left to right, and each new cluster gets the next number.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the bottom rows (row 9, then row 8, etc.) might have clusters. Let's see:\n\nRow 9: ends with 5, but in the input, row 9 is [0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 5s are in positions 3-4. Then row 8 has a 5 in position 0. Wait, maybe the clusters are as follows. Let me outline the clusters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each contiguous group of 5s is a cluster. The numbers in the output are assigned in the order of the clusters from bottom to top. So the bottommost cluster is 1, then the next one up is 2, etc.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nIn row 9, there are two 5s at columns 3 and 4. That's a cluster. Then in row 8, there's a 5 in column 0 and column 4. Wait, but row 8's 5 in column 4 is next to row 9's 5s? No, row 8 is [0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0], so the 5s are at column 1 and 4. Row 9's 5s are at 3 and 4. So the 5 in column 4 of row 8 is adjacent (diagonally?) to row 9's 5s. So maybe they're part of the same cluster. Then perhaps that cluster is considered the bottommost.\n\nBut in the output, the cluster in row 9 and 8 would be labeled as 2 (from the output row 9: [0,0,0,2,2,0,...]). So maybe that's cluster 2. Then the next cluster up is cluster 3. Wait, perhaps the numbering is 1,2,3 based on the order when scanning from bottom up. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's output, the bottom clusters:\n\n- Row 5: [0,0,...,0,2] (single 2)\n- Row 6: [...,3,3,0,0,2]\n- Row 7: [3,0,...,0,2]\n- Row 8: [3,0,0,2,...]\n- Row 9: [0,0,0,2,2,...]\n\nSo perhaps the 2 and 3 in the lower part are part of different clusters. Let me check the input.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 0:\n\nRow 5: [0,...,0,5]\nRow 6: [0,...,5,5,0,0,5]\nRow 7: [5,0,...,0,5]\nRow 8: [5,0,0,5,0,...]\nRow 9: [0,...,5,5,...]\n\nWait, perhaps the 5s in row 5's last column (5,9) is part of a cluster that includes row 6's (9) and row 7's (9). Then that's a vertical line. But in row 6, there are also 5s in columns 5-6. So maybe two clusters in the lower part: one at columns 5-6 (rows 6-7?) and another in column 9 (rows 5-7). Then in the output, those clusters are labeled 2 and 3. Let's see:\n\nIn output Example 0:\n\nRow 5: last element is 2 (so part of cluster 2)\nRow 6: columns 5-6 are 3,3, and column 9 is 2\nRow7: column0 is3, column9 is2\nRow8: column0 is3, column4 is2\n\nSo maybe the cluster in column 9 (rows5-7) is labeled 2, and the cluster in rows6-8 (columns5-6, column0) is labeled3. Then the upper cluster (rows1-3, columns7-8) is labeled1.\n\nSo the order of labeling is: clusters are numbered starting from the bottom, and each new cluster gets the next number. So when scanning the grid from bottom to top, left to right, each time a new cluster is found, assign the next number. So the first cluster encountered (bottommost) would be 1, then next 2, etc.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the cluster in row9 (columns3-4) is labeled2. Then in row8, column0 and 4. The 5s in column4 of row8 and row9 would be connected, forming a cluster. Then in row8, column0's 5 is part of another cluster (maybe with row7's column0 5). Let's see input for example0:\n\nRow7: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5]\nRow8: [0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow9: [0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo row7's column0 is 0. Wait, row7's first element is 0, then 5 at column1. Wait, in input example0:\n\nRow7 (input): [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5]\n\nSo row7 has 5s at columns1 and 9. Row8 has 5s at columns1 and4. Row9 has 5s at columns3 and4. So perhaps the cluster in row9's 3-4 is part of a group that connects up. Let's see:\n\nRow9's 5s are at (row9,3) and (row9,4). Then row8 has a 5 at (row8,4), which is adjacent (above) to row9's (row9,4). So that's connected. Then row8's (row8,4) is connected to row9's (row9,4). So that's a cluster. Then row8's (row8,1) is another 5. That's adjacent to row7's (row7,1) which is a 5. So that forms a separate cluster. So there are two clusters in the lower part: one in rows8-9 (columns4) and 3-4, and another in rows7-8 (columns1). Then the cluster in row5-7's column9.\n\nSo in Example0's output, the numbers for these clusters are 2, 3, 1? Wait the output labels the column9 cluster as 2 (rows5-7, column9), the rows7-8 column1 as 3, and the upper cluster (rows1-3, columns7-8) as 1. So maybe the numbering is based on the order in which clusters are found when scanning from top to bottom, left to right. So first the upper cluster (rows1-3) is found, labeled 1. Then the next cluster when scanning down would be the column9 cluster (rows5-7), labeled 2. Then the row7-8 column1 cluster labeled3, then the row8-9 columns3-4 and 4 labeled2 again. Hmm, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are assigned based on the size of the cluster. But looking at the examples, the numbers don't correspond to the cluster sizes. For example, in Example0, the upper cluster (1) has 6 5s (rows1: two, row2: four, row3: two?), perhaps. The cluster labeled2 might have 3 cells (row5's last, row6's last, row7's last). The cluster labeled3 (rows6's 5-6, row7's column0, row8's column0) has 4 cells. So maybe not size-based.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers could represent the order in which clusters are discovered when scanning the grid in a certain way. For instance, left to right, top to bottom. So the first cluster found is labeled 1, the next 2, etc.\n\nIn Example0's input, the first cluster (when scanning top to bottom, left to right) is the upper-right one. Then the next cluster is the column9 in row5-7, then the left cluster in rows7-8, then the lower cluster in rows8-9. So the labels would be 1, 2, 3, 2? But the output for example0's lower cluster in rows8-9 is labeled2 again. That might suggest that different clusters can have the same label. But in the examples, each cluster has a unique label.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs again. In example0's output, the cluster in rows5-7 (column9) is labeled2, the cluster in rows6-8 (columns5-6 and 0) is labeled3, and the cluster in rows8-9 (columns3-4 and4) is labeled2. That can't be right, unless there's a different rule. Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the clusters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output numbers are based on the number of 5s in the cluster modulo some number. But that seems less likely.\n\nAnother approach: look at the input and output of each example and see how the 5s are replaced. Let's take example0:\n\nIn input example0, the 5s are replaced as follows:\n\n- The upper cluster (rows1-3, columns7-8 and 2-4) becomes 1s.\n- The lower cluster in column9 (rows5-7) becomes 2s.\n- The left cluster (rows6-8, columns5-6 and 0) becomes3s.\n- The cluster in rows8-9 (columns3-4 and4) becomes 2s again.\n\nWait, but how can two clusters have the same label? Maybe the labels are not unique. But in example0's output, there are clusters labeled 1,2,3, and another 2. That suggests that perhaps the labels are assigned based on some property other than unique cluster identification.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers represent regions based on vertical layers. Like, the top third is 1, middle third 2, bottom third 3, but that doesn't fit the examples. For example, in example2's output, the bottom cluster (rows6-8) is labeled1, which is the lowest number, which would be the bottom third. So maybe vertical layers, but inverted. The lower the cluster's position, the lower the number.\n\nWait, in example2's output, the cluster at the bottom (rows6-8) is labeled1, the cluster in the middle (row5, columns4-5) is labeled3, and the upper cluster (rows1-2) is labeled3 and 2. So that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the label is determined by the row of the topmost cell in the cluster. The higher the topmost cell, the higher the label. So in example0, the upper cluster's top row is row1 (the earliest), so labeled1. The cluster in column9 (rows5-7) starts at row5, so labeled2. The left cluster (rows6-8) starts at row6, labeled3. The cluster in rows8-9 starts at row8, which is lower than row5, so labeled2 again. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the label increments each time a new cluster is found when scanning the grid from bottom to top, left to right. So starting from the bottom row, scan each row left to right. When a 5 is found that hasn't been labeled yet, assign the next label. So the first cluster encountered (the bottommost) gets 1, next 2, etc.\n\nLet's test this with example2's input. The input has a cluster at rows6-8 (the 5s on the left). Scanning from the bottom row (row9) which is all zeros, then row8: [5,0,0,0,...]. So the first 5 encountered is row8, column0. Then check adjacent cells for cluster. This would form the first cluster (labeled1). Then moving up, row7: [5,5,0...] which is part of the same cluster. Row6: [5,...] which is also part of the same cluster. So this cluster is labeled1. Then next, in row5, there's a cluster at columns4-5. When scanning from bottom up, this cluster is found after the bottom cluster. So it gets labeled2. Then in row1-2, there's a cluster. When scanning from bottom up, this is found after the row5 cluster. So labeled3. Then in row0's column9 (if any), but in example2's input, row0 has a 5 in column9. But in example2's output, the output for row0's column9 is 0, but in row6, the 5 in column0 is labeled1. Wait, maybe that's part of the bottom cluster. So according to this logic, the bottom cluster is labeled1, then the middle cluster (row5) labeled2, upper cluster (row1-2) labeled3. Which matches example2's output. Let's check:\n\nIn example2's output, the bottom cluster (rows6-8) is labeled1. The cluster in row5 (columns4-5) is labeled3. Wait, that doesn't fit. Wait, example2's output row5 is [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0]. So the cluster in row5 (columns4-5) is labeled3. Then the cluster in rows1-2 (columns2-3 and 7-8) is labeled2 and3. Hmm. Maybe this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the labels are assigned based on the order of clusters encountered when scanning the grid from bottom to top, left to right. Let's try this with example0:\n\nStart at row9 (bottom), scan left to right. In example0's input, row9 has 5s at columns3 and4. This is a new cluster (cluster1). Then row8: columns1 and4. The 5 at column4 is adjacent to row9's column4, so part of cluster1. The 5 at column1 in row8 is a new cluster (cluster2). Row7: column1 and9. The column1 is adjacent to row8's column1 (cluster2), so part of it. Column9's 5 is a new cluster (cluster3). Row6: columns5,6, and9. Columns5-6 are new (cluster4), and column9 is part of cluster3. Row5: column9 (part of cluster3). Rows1-3: columns7-8, etc. So the clusters in example0 would be labeled in the order they were found: cluster1 (row9-8-...), cluster2 (row8's column1 and row7's column1), cluster3 (row7's column9, row6's column9, row5's column9), cluster4 (row6's columns5-6), and the upper cluster. Wait, but in the output of example0, the upper cluster is labeled1. This approach doesn't align.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Let's compare the input and output numbers in each cell.\n\nIn example0, the 5s in the upper cluster (rows1-3) become1. The 5s in the lower right (column9, rows5-7) become2. The 5s in the lower middle (columns5-6, row6-7) become3. The 5s in the lower left (row8, column0 and row7 column0?) become3. The 5s in row8-9 (columns3-4) become2.\n\nSo, maybe the label is determined by the direction from which the cluster is connected. For example, clusters connected to the bottom edge get label1, those connected to the right edge get label2, and others label3. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the labels correspond to the number of adjacent (including diagonal) 5s each cell has. But looking at example0's output, the cell in row1, column7 is 1, and in the input, it's 5. Its neighbors: row0, column7 is 0; row1, column6 is 0; row1, column8 is5; row2, column7 is5. So adjacent cells (including diagonally) would have some 5s. But the output is 1. Not sure how that would translate.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers indicate the distance from the bottom edge. For example, cells closer to the bottom are labeled1, then higher up labeled2, etc. Let's check example0:\n\nRow9 is the bottom row. The 5s in row9 are labeled2, so that doesn't fit. If bottom is 1, then row9 would be1. But in example0's output, row9's 5s are2.\n\nAnother idea: maybe each cluster is labeled based on the lowest row it occupies. For example, if a cluster has cells in the lowest row (row9), it's label1. If a cluster is higher up, the label increases. So in example0, the cluster in rows8-9 (columns3-4) would be label1 (since it's in row9), the cluster in rows5-7 (column9) would be label2 (since its lowest row is5?), but row5 is higher than row9. Wait, no. Maybe the highest row in the cluster. If the cluster's highest row is row5, then label is based on that. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers might represent the order in which clusters are discovered when scanning the grid in a certain order. Let's try to simulate this.\n\nAssume that the grid is scanned from bottom to top, left to right. Each time a new cluster is encountered (a 5 that hasn't been labeled yet), assign the next number starting from 1.\n\nLet's test this with example0:\n\nStart from row9 (bottom row), scan left to right. Columns3 and4 are5. Assign label1. Then move up to row8. Column1 and4: column4 is part of the existing cluster (row9,3-4 and row8,4). So it's already labeled. Column1 in row8 is new. Assign label2. Then row7: column1 is adjacent to row8, column1 (label2). Column9 in row7 is new: assign label3. Row6: columns5-6 are new: label4. Column9 is part of label3. Row5: column9 is part of label3. Then rows1-3: columns7-8, etc. Assign labels as they are found. But in the output of example0, the upper cluster is labeled1. So this approach doesn't explain it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the clusters are numbered in the order they appear when scanning the grid from top to bottom, left to right. So first clusters encountered in the upper part get labeled1, then next 2, etc.\n\nIn example0's input:\n\nRow0: all zeros. Row1: column7-8 are5. So this is the first cluster, label1. Then row2 has 5s in columns0-1 (no, in example0 input row2 is [0,5,5,0,...]. Wait, row1's columns7-8 are5. Row2's columns7-8 are5. So part of the same cluster. Then row3's columns2-3 are5. Wait, not sure. Maybe this cluster is the first, labeled1. Then next cluster in row5, column9: label2. Then in row6, columns5-6: label3. Then row7, column0: label4. Then row8, column0: part of row7's cluster. Then row8, column4: label5. But the output doesn't have 4 or5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the output numbers in the training examples. In example0, the numbers are 1,2,3. Example1 has 1,2,3. Example2 has 1,2,3. So the numbers are up to 3. So perhaps the numbers cycle through 1,2,3 based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers represent the layer of the cluster. Like, the first layer (outermost) is 1, next is2, etc. But how?\n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output cell by cell for each example. For example, in example0's input row1, columns7-8 are5. Output is1. row2, columns7-8:5 \u21921. row3, columns2-3:5 \u21921. row5, column9:5\u21922. row6, columns5-6:5\u21923. row6, column9:5\u21922. row7, column0:5\u21923. row7, column9:5\u21922. row8, column0:5\u21923. row8, column4:5\u21922. row9, columns3-4:5\u21922.\n\nLooking for a pattern here. Not sure. Maybe the output numbers are related to the position of the cell's cluster in a certain order. Alternatively, the number could be the count of certain neighboring conditions. Like, the number of adjacent 5s. But that seems not to fit.\n\nWait, let's look at example0's output. The clusters labeled1 are in the upper part. Clusters labeled2 and3 are in the lower part. The cluster labeled2 includes cells in rows5-7 (column9), rows8-9 (columns3-4). The cluster labeled3 includes cells in rows6-7 (columns5-6 and0). Maybe the labeling depends on whether the cluster is connected to the top, bottom, left, or right edges.\n\nAlternatively, the labels are based on the horizontal position. Clusters on the right side are labeled2, left labeled3, and others labeled1. But example0's upper cluster is on the right, labeled1. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: the output numbers represent the number of 5s in the cluster modulo 3 plus 1. For example, cluster with 2 cells \u21922 mod3+1=3. But example0's upper cluster has multiple 5s. Let's count:\n\nExample0's upper cluster (rows1-3):\n\nRow1: 2 5s.\nRow2: 2 5s (columns7-8) and 2 others (columns1-2). Wait, input row2: [0,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0]. So columns1-2 and7-8. So that's 4 cells. Then row3 has 2 5s (columns2-3). So total of 8 cells. 8 mod3 is 2, plus1 \u21923. But the output is labeled1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting tricky. Let's try another angle. Let's look for a rule that applies to all examples.\n\nIn example0's output, the clusters are labeled1,2,3. In example1's output, the labels are1,2,3. In example2, same. So each cluster is labeled with a number from1-3. The same number can appear in different clusters (like example0's cluster labeled2 appears in two different clusters). So the label isn't unique per cluster. So the label must be based on some property of the cluster's position.\n\nLooking at example0:\n\nCluster labeled1: upper part, middle-right.\nCluster labeled2: lower-right and lower-middle.\nCluster labeled3: lower-left.\n\nExample1:\n\nCluster labeled1: lower part.\nCluster labeled2: middle.\nCluster labeled3: upper-middle.\n\nExample2:\n\nCluster labeled1: bottom-left.\nCluster labeled2: upper-middle.\nCluster labeled3: middle.\n\nSo the labels don't seem to correspond to a fixed position. Maybe the labels are assigned based on the number of neighboring zeros in the input? Or perhaps the number of steps from the nearest edge.\n\nAlternatively, the label is determined by the sum of the x and y coordinates modulo 3. But example0's upper cluster has cells in rows1-3, columns7-8. So for row1, column7: 1+7=8 mod3 is 2, +1=3. But in output, it's1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, another thought: the numbers in the output could be based on the order of the clusters when sorted by their distance from the bottom. The closest cluster to the bottom gets1, next2, etc. Let's check example0's clusters.\n\nIn example0, the bottom-most cluster is in row9, columns3-4. Then row8, column4. So that cluster is at the bottom. So labeled1. Then the cluster in row8, column1 and row7, column1. That's higher up. So labeled2. Then the cluster in column9 (rows5-7). Label3. But in the output, these are labeled2 and3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the labels are based on the horizontal position. For example, clusters on the left third get1, middle third 2, right third3. But in example0's cluster labeled1 is on the right. So not.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the labels are assigned in a way that each cluster's label is determined by the number of clusters already assigned in that region. But this is vague.\n\nWait, let's look at the test input and see if applying a possible pattern would make sense.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5]\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5]\nRow2: [0,0,5,5,0,5,5,0,0,5]\nRow3: [0,5,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5]\nRow4: all zeros.\nRow5: all zeros.\nRow6: [5,0,...,0]\nRow7: [5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0]\nRow8: [5,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]\nRow9: all zeros.\n\nSo possible clusters:\n\n- Row0-3, column9: 5s in rows0,1,2,3 (column9). Connected vertically.\n- Row2, columns2-3: 5s.\n- Row2, columns5-6:5s.\n- Row3, columns1-2:5s and column6:5.\n- Row6, column0:5.\n- Row7, column0:5, columns3-4:5s, column7:5.\n- Row8, column0:5, column7:5.\n\nClusters:\n\nCluster1: rows0-3, column9. This is a vertical line in the far right.\n\nCluster2: row2, columns2-3 and row3, columns1-2. Connected via row3's columns1-2 to row2's 2-3.\n\nCluster3: row2, columns5-6. Connected to row3, column6 (5) \u2014 but row3's column6 is a 5. So this is a cluster: row2's 5-6, row3's column6. Are they connected? Diagonally adjacent. So maybe.\n\nCluster4: row6, column0 and row7, column0. Also row7, column0 and row8, column0.\n\nCluster5: row7, columns3-4 (5s) and perhaps others.\n\nCluster6: row7, column7 and row8, column7.\n\nSo how would these clusters be labeled based on the examples' patterns?\n\nAssuming that the labels are assigned based on the vertical position, with the lowest clusters getting higher numbers. Or perhaps the labels are assigned in the order of scanning from bottom to top, left to right.\n\nIn the test input, the bottom-most clusters are in rows6-8 (column0), row7's columns3-4, and row7's column7.\n\nIf we scan from bottom to top, left to right:\n\nRow9: all zeros. Row8: column0 (5) and7 (5). So first cluster is column0 in row8. Assign label1. Then column7 in row8: another cluster, label2. Then row7: column0 (already labeled1), columns3-4 (new cluster, label3), column7 (new, label4). Row6: column0 (part of label1). Row5-4: zeros. Row3: columns1-2 (5s) and column6 (5). Row2: columns2-3 and5-6. Row0-1: column9. But according to the examples, the labels are 1,2,3. So perhaps there's a cycle where after 3, it goes back to1.\n\nBut the examples only use up to3. So maybe labels are assigned in the order of discovery, but modulo3. So first cluster:1, second:2, third:3, fourth:1, etc.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nClusters discovered from bottom to top, left to right.\n\nRow8:\n\n- column0: new cluster \u2192 label1.\n- column7: new cluster \u2192 label2.\n\nRow7:\n\n- columns3-4: new \u2192 label3.\n- column7: new (but row8's column7 is label2, so maybe connected. Are row7's column7 and row8's column7 adjacent? Yes, diagonally. So part of the same cluster (label2). So column7 in row7 is part of label2.\n\nRow6:\n\n- column0: part of label1.\n\nRow5-4: zeros.\n\nRow3:\n\n- column1-2: new cluster \u2192 label1 (since after 3, it cycles to1).\n- column6: new \u2192 label2.\n\nRow2:\n\n- columns2-3: adjacent to row3's columns1-2 \u2192 part of label1.\n- columns5-6: adjacent to row3's column6 (label2) \u2192 part of label2.\n\nRow1-0:\n\n- column9: new cluster \u2192 label3.\n\nSo the clusters would have labels:\n\n- cluster1: rows8-7-6 column0 \u2192 label1.\n- cluster2: rows8-7 column7 \u2192 label2.\n- cluster3: row7 columns3-4 \u2192 label3.\n- cluster1 (cycle after3): row3 columns1-2 and row2 columns2-3 \u2192 label1.\n- cluster2: row3 column6 and row2 columns5-6 \u2192 label2.\n- cluster3: row0-3 column9 \u2192 label3.\n\nThen in the output:\n\nRow0-3's column9 would be labeled3.\n\nRow2's columns2-3 and row3's 1-2: label1.\n\nRow2's columns5-6 and row3's6: label2.\n\nRow7's columns3-4: label3.\n\nRow7-8's columns7: label2.\n\nRow6-8's column0: label1.\n\nSo let's see how that would look.\n\nTest input's output:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]\n\nRow2: [0,0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,3]\n\nRow3: [0,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,3]\n\nRow4-5: zeros.\n\nRow6: [1,0,...,0] \u2192 label1.\n\nRow7: [1,0,0,3,3,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow8: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow9: zeros.\n\nThis seems plausible. But comparing to the training examples, the numbers are assigned based on the order of discovery from bottom to top, left to right, cycling 1-3.\n\nIn example0's output, the first cluster (bottom-most) is labeled2. But according to this logic, it should be1. Hmm. Maybe my previous assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the labels are assigned based on the order of clusters when scanning from top to bottom, left to right, but then modulo3. For example, first cluster is1, second2, third3, fourth1, etc.\n\nBut in example0's input, the first cluster encountered when scanning from top is the upper cluster (rows1-3), which is labeled1. Then the next cluster (row5, column9) labeled2. Then row6, columns5-6 labeled3. Then row7, column0 labeled1. So this would cycle. But in example0's output, those clusters are labeled1,2,3,3,2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe another approach: look for the positions where 5s are replaced by 1,2,3. In example0's output, the upper cluster is 1, lower clusters are 2 and3. In example1's output, the lower clusters are1, middle 2, upper 3. In example2's output, bottom clusters are1, middle 3, upper 2 and3. Hmm. Not a clear pattern.\n\nWait, looking at example0's output, the numbers 1,2,3 seem to be assigned based on the vertical position. The higher clusters get lower numbers. For example, the upper cluster (highest) is1, then the middle cluster is2, the lower clusters are3 and2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers could be based on the distance from the top. But how?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the label is determined by the number of rows from the bottom to the top of the cluster. For example, if a cluster spans rows5-7, the distance from the bottom (row9) is row9 - row5 =4. So label could be (4 mod3) +1. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the label is the number of clusters found in the same vertical region. For example, clusters in the bottom third get labeled1, middle third2, upper third3. Let's check example0's output:\n\nThe upper cluster is labeled1 (upper third?), but example0's upper cluster is in rows1-3 (rows0-3 would be upper third of 10 rows). The middle third might be rows4-6, lower third7-9. So clusters in rows1-3 (upper third) labeled1. Clusters in rows5-7 (middle third) labeled2. Clusters in rows7-9 (lower third) labeled3. But in example0's output, the cluster in rows5-7 is labeled2, and the cluster in rows7-9 is labeled2 and3. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to think of what's common between the examples.\n\nEach output number is replacing a 5 in the input. The numbers are1,2,3. In each example, the clusters are replaced with these numbers, possibly based on their position. \n\nAnother possibility: the number represents the count of clusters encountered in a certain direction. For example, in example0's output, the upper cluster is the first when scanning left-right, top-bottom, so labeled1. The next cluster (column9) is2, then next is3, and so on, cycling.\n\nBut how to apply this to the test input. The test input has clusters:\n\n1. column0 in rows6-8.\n\n2. column7 in rows7-8.\n\n3. column9 in rows0-3.\n\n4. columns2-3 in rows2-3.\n\n5. columns5-6 in rows2-3.\n\n6. columns3-4 in row7.\n\nSo when scanning top to bottom, left to right:\n\nFirst cluster is column9 in rows0-3: label1.\n\nThen column2-3 in row2-3: label2.\n\nThen columns5-6 and3-6: label3.\n\nThen column0 in rows6-8: label1.\n\nThen column3-4 row7: label2.\n\nThen column7 rows7-8: label3.\n\nSo output would be:\n\nRow0-3, column9:1.\n\nRow2-3 columns2-3:2.\n\nRow2-3 columns5-6:3.\n\nRow6-8 column0:1.\n\nRow7 columns3-4:2.\n\nRow7-8 column7:3.\n\nBut in the training examples, the numbers don't seem to cycle. For instance, example0 has 1,2,3, but no cycling. So perhaps this is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are assigned based on the number of 5s in the cluster modulo3 plus1. Let's check example0's upper cluster: 8 cells. 8 mod3 is2, plus1 is3. But output is1. So no.\n\nAnother idea: The label corresponds to the number of connected edges each cell has. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each cluster is assigned a number based on the earliest occurrence of its shape. But this seems unlikely.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not found a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the assumption that clusters are labeled in the order they are encountered when scanning the grid from bottom to top, left to right, with labels cycling 1-3. For the test input, this would result in the bottom clusters getting labels1, next2, etc., cycling back after3.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nStart scanning from the bottom (row9) upwards, left to right.\n\nRow9: all zeros.\n\nRow8: column0 is5 \u2192 new cluster (label1). Column7 is5 \u2192 new cluster (label2).\n\nRow7: column0 is part of cluster1. Columns3-4: new (label3). Column7 is part of cluster2.\n\nRow6: column0 part of cluster1.\n\nRow5: zeros.\n\nRow4: zeros.\n\nRow3: column9 is5 \u2192 new cluster (label1, since after3, cycle back). Columns1-2:5 \u2192 new cluster (label2). Column6:5 \u2192 new cluster (label3).\n\nRow2: column9 part of cluster1. Columns2-3: adjacent to row3's columns1-2 (cluster2). Columns5-6: adjacent to row3's column6 (cluster3).\n\nRow1: column9 part of cluster1.\n\nRow0: column9 part of cluster1.\n\nSo labels:\n\nCluster1 (rows8-6 column0): label1.\n\nCluster2 (rows8-7 column7): label2.\n\nCluster3 (row7 columns3-4): label3.\n\nCluster4 (rows0-3 column9): label1.\n\nCluster5 (rows3-2 columns1-3): label2.\n\nCluster6 (rows3-2 columns5-6): label3.\n\nThen, when writing the output, each cell in these clusters is replaced with their respective labels.\n\nSo the test input's output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow2: [0,0,2,2,0,3,3,0,0,1]\n\nRow3: [0,2,2,0,0,0,3,0,0,1]\n\nRow4: all zeros.\n\nRow5: all zeros.\n\nRow6: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [1,0,0,3,3,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow8: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow9: all zeros.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the labeling might have a different order. For instance, in example2, the bottom cluster is labeled1. According to this logic, that's correct.\n\nSo this seems to fit. Therefore, the final answer would be as above.",

The question is, how are these numbers determined?\n\nLet's start by comparing example 0's input and output. In the input, there are regions of 5s. The output replaces these regions with 1s, 2s, 3s. Maybe each contiguous region of 5s is assigned a different number, but it's not just a single number per region. For instance, in example 0's output, there's a 1, then a 2, then a 3. How do they relate?\n\nLooking at the first input row in example 0's input, the 5s are arranged in certain positions. The output's numbers might be based on the number of adjacent 5s each cell has. Wait, but in the output, the same region might have different numbers. For example, in example 0's output, the top 5s are replaced by 1s, then lower ones by 2 and 3. Hmm, maybe the numbers indicate the order in which regions are processed, like a flood fill. Or perhaps the number represents the distance from a certain point.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the count of neighboring 5s. Let's check a cell in example 0. Take the cell in row 1, column 7 (assuming 0-indexed). In the input, it's 5. In output, it's 1. How many adjacent 5s does it have? Let's see:\n\nFor cell (1,7) in input:\n\nNeighbors would be up (0,7) which is 0, down (2,7) which is 5, left (1,6) is 0, right (1,8) is 5. So adjacent cells (including diagonals?) Wait, but in example 0's output, the 5s in row 1 are part of a group that's replaced by 1s. Then, in row 5, the last element is 5 in input, output is 2. Let's check that cell's neighbors.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers in the output represent how many 5s are in a connected region. For example, in example 0, the first group (around row 1-2, columns 7-8) has 4 cells (since in input rows 1,2, columns 7-8 are 5s). But the output uses 1s here. Then another group in row 5, column 9 (output 2), maybe that's a single 5? No, in input row 5, column 9 is 5. Then in output, row 5, column 9 is 2. But in the input, that 5 is connected to others in rows 6-8. Wait, maybe the numbers are based on layers or steps from the edge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output numbers represent the order in which regions are labeled, starting from the bottom. For example, in example 0's output, the lower region (rows 6-8, columns 5-6 and 9) are labeled 3 and 2. But I'm not sure. \n\nAnother angle: maybe each region is labeled with a number based on the number of 5s in that region. For example, the largest region gets 1, next 2, etc. But looking at example 0's output: the first group (1s) has 4 cells. Then the group with 2s (row 5,9; row 9,3-4; row 6,5-6) might be part of separate regions. Wait, perhaps the regions are labeled in the order they appear when scanning the grid from bottom to top, left to right. So the first region encountered gets 1, then 2, etc. Let's check.\n\nIn example 0's input, looking from the bottom up. The last row (row 9) has 5s at columns 3 and 4. In the output, those are 2. Then moving up, row 8 has a 5 at column 4 (output 2). Row 6 has 5s at 5-6 (output 3s), and rows 7-8 columns 9 (output 2). Wait, maybe the numbers are assigned based on the layer of the region. Like, if the region is on the edge, it's a certain number, but deeper layers get higher numbers. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are based on the number of neighboring 5s in the input. For example, a cell that has two adjacent 5s becomes 2, etc. Let me test this. Take example 0's input cell (2,7) which is 5. In output, it's 1. Let's count adjacent 5s. The cell (2,7) has neighbors:\n\nTop: (1,7) is 5.\n\nBottom: (3,7) is 0.\n\nLeft: (2,6) is 0.\n\nRight: (2,8) is 5.\n\nSo four adjacent cells (top, right, maybe diagonals?), but perhaps considering only orthogonal (up, down, left, right). So top and right are 5. So two neighbors. If the output is 1, that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output numbers represent the number of adjacent 5s in the input. So if a cell has two 5 neighbors, output 2. But in example 0's output, the 1s have how many neighbors? Let's check cell (1,7) in input: adjacent 5s are (1,8), (2,7). So two. But output is 1. That doesn't match.\n\nAnother possibility: the numbers represent the distance from the edge of the region. Like, cells on the perimeter are 1, next layer 2, etc. Let's see. For example, in the first group (1s in example 0's output), maybe those cells are on the edge. Let's look at the group in rows 1-2, columns 7-8. The cells (1,7), (1,8), (2,7), (2,8) are all 5s. In the output, all are 1. If it's the perimeter, maybe all are edge cells. But in that case, perhaps the center would have higher numbers. But here, the group is 2x2, so all cells are on the perimeter. Then maybe the next group (the 2s) would be a single cell? For example, row 5, column 9: in input, it's a 5. In output, 2. But that cell is adjacent to the 5s in row 6, column 9. So maybe it's part of a different region.\n\nWait, perhaps the regions are connected diagonally. Let me check how the regions are connected. In example 0's input:\n\nLooking at row 1, columns 7-8 are 5s. Then row 2, columns 7-8 are 5s. So that's a 2x2 square. So in output, all are 1. Then the next region is in row 3, columns 2-3: 5s. Output is 1s. Wait, no, the output for row 3, columns 2-3 is 1s. Then the output for row 5, column 9 is 2, and row 6, columns 5-6 are 3s. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are assigned based on the order in which regions are discovered when scanning the grid from top to bottom, left to right. So the first group encountered (row 1, columns 7-8) gets 1, the next (row 3, columns 2-3) gets 2, then row 5, column 9 (single cell?) gets 3. But in example 0's output, the numbers are 1, 2, 3. Let me check:\n\nWait in example 0's input:\n\n- The first group (top) is rows 1-2, columns 7-8: 5s. Output: 1s.\n\n- The next group is row 3, columns 2-3: 5s. Output: 1s. Wait, that's same number. Hmm. So that contradicts the idea of numbering regions in order. Unless the regions are merged somehow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers represent the layer in terms of connectedness. Like, the first group (1s) are connected to the top, the second (2s) connected to the bottom, etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet's look at example 1. The input has regions. The output numbers vary. For instance, in example 1's output, there's a group with 2s, then 3s, then 1s. Maybe the numbers are assigned based on the size of the region. The largest region gets 1, next 2, etc. Let's check:\n\nIn example 1's input, row 2 has a group of 3 5s (columns 1-3). Output for those is 2. Then in row 8, there's a group of 5s (columns 0-2, 6-8). Output is 1s. If the size of the region determines the number, the largest would be 1. Let's count the cells:\n\nRow 8's group: columns 0-2 (3 cells) and 6-8 (3 cells) connected? Maybe. So total 6 cells. The row 2's group is 3 cells. Then maybe 6 is the largest, so labeled 1. Then the next largest gets 2, etc. But in example 1's output, the 3s are in row 2, column 7. Let's check the size of that region. Row 2, column 7: 5. In output, it's 3. The adjacent cells: row 1, column 7 is 0. Row 3, column 7 is 5. So that's two cells. So perhaps the regions are ordered by size, but the numbers in the output are assigned in reverse. Or maybe the numbers are assigned based on the position of the region.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are based on the row number. Like, regions in lower rows get higher numbers. In example 0's output, the 3s are in row 6. The 1s are higher up. So perhaps lower regions have higher numbers. But example 1's output has 1s in row 8 (lower part) and 2s in row 2 (upper). So that could fit. So maybe regions are labeled based on their vertical position: the lower the region, the higher the number. So in example 0, the lowest region is row 6-8, which is 3. The next is row 5-9 (the 2s), and the upper regions are 1. That might fit.\n\nBut how to confirm. Let's look at example 2's input and output. The output has 3s in row 1, column 2 and row 5, columns 4-5. Then 2s in row 1, columns 6-7 and row 2, column 7. The 1s are in rows 6-8. So the lower regions (rows 6-8) have 1s, higher regions have higher numbers. So this contradicts the previous hypothesis. Because in example 2, lower regions are 1, middle regions are 2, upper are 3. So maybe it's the opposite: regions higher up get higher numbers. Wait, but in example 0, the 3s are in row 6, which is lower than the 1s in rows 1-3. So this is conflicting. So that theory might not hold.\n\nAlternative idea: The numbers in the output represent the number of connected regions that a particular cell is part of. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output numbers are based on the number of steps required to reach the edge of the grid. For example, if a cell is near the edge, it's labeled 1, deeper in gets higher numbers. Let's check example 0. The cell in row 1, column 7: it's near the top edge (row 1). So maybe labeled 1. Then deeper cells would be higher. But looking at row 6, columns 5-6: those are 5s in input. Output 3. Those cells are near the middle. So perhaps 3 steps from the edge. Let me see. Row 6 is middle of the grid. How far from the edge? From top edge (row 0) is 6 steps, from bottom edge (row 9) is 3 steps. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of each connected region of 5s as a separate object, and the output numbers are assigned in the order they are encountered when scanning the grid from the bottom to the top, left to right. So the first region found (starting from the bottom left) gets 1, the next gets 2, etc. Let's check example 0.\n\nIn example 0's input, the bottom-most 5s are in row 9, columns 3-4. Then moving up, row 8 has a 5 in column 4. Then row 6-8, columns 9. Let's see:\n\nLooking from the bottom up:\n\nRow 9 (last row) has 5s at columns 3-4. So the first region encountered (bottom-up scan) would be this. In output, those cells are 2. Hmm. Then row 8 has a 5 at column 4 (output 2). Then rows 6-7-8, columns 9: 5s. In output, those are 2 and 3. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbering is from top to bottom, left to right. The first region found gets 1, next 2, etc. In example 0's input, the first 5 is at row 1, column 7. That region is labeled 1. Then row 3, columns 2-3: labeled 1 again. Wait, but that's the same number. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each contiguous region is assigned a unique number, but the numbers start at 1 and increment each time a new region is found. For example, in example 0's input, the first region (top right) is 1, then the next region (middle) is 2, then another region is 3. But in example 0's output, there are 1, 2, and 3. Let's see:\n\nLooking at example 0's input, the regions of 5s:\n\n1. Rows 1-2, columns 7-8: a 2x2 block. Output: 1s.\n\n2. Row 3, columns 2-3: a 2-cell block. Output: 1s.\n\n3. Row 5, column 9: a single cell. Output: 2.\n\n4. Rows 6-7, columns 5-6: a 2x2 block. Output: 3s.\n\n5. Row 6-7-8, columns 9: a vertical line of 3 cells. Output: 2s.\n\nWait, but the single cell (row5, col9) is adjacent to row6, col9 (5), so maybe they are connected. So perhaps the regions are:\n\n- The top right (rows 1-2, cols7-8) and middle (row3, cols2-3) are two regions labeled 1.\n\nBut in the output, those are both labeled 1. Then the vertical line in rows 5-8, cols9 is another region labeled 2. The block in rows6-7, cols5-6 is labeled 3. So that would suggest that the regions are numbered in the order they are found, but how? Maybe when scanning left to right, top to bottom. So first region is top right (1), then middle left (2), then the vertical line (3), then the lower block (4). But the output uses numbers 1, 2, 3. So maybe the numbering is cyclic? Like after 3, it wraps around. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers indicate the number of connected components. For example, each time a new region is found, the number increments. But in example 0's output, there are three different numbers. So maybe three regions. Wait, but example 0's input has more than three regions. For example, the top right block, the middle left block, the vertical line in columns9, the lower block (rows6-7, cols5-6). That's four regions. But the output uses 1, 2, 3. So perhaps the numbers are not per region.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers represent the layer in terms of being enclosed. Like, if a region is enclosed by other 5s, it gets a higher number. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the test input and trying to apply the same pattern. Let's see:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [0,0,5,5,0,5,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow3: [0,5,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow4: all 0s.\n\nRow5: all 0s.\n\nRow6: [5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nRow8: [5,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nRow9: all 0s.\n\nLooking for regions of 5s:\n\n- The rightmost column (col9) has 5s in rows0-3. That's a vertical line of four cells. \n\n- Row2 has 5s at cols2-3 and 5-6.\n\n- Row3 has 5s at cols1-2 and 6.\n\n- Row6 has a 5 at col0.\n\n- Row7 has 5s at cols0, 3-4, 7.\n\n- Row8 has 5s at col0 and 7.\n\nSo the regions would be:\n\n1. The vertical line in col9, rows0-3. This is a connected region.\n\n2. The group in row2, cols2-3 and 5-6. Are these connected? If adjacency includes diagonal, then maybe. For example, row2, col3 (5) and row3, col1-2 (5s) might not connect. Let me see: row2, cols2-3 (5s), row3, cols1-2 (5s). These are diagonally adjacent. So that forms a larger region. Similarly, row2, cols5-6 (5s) and row3, col6 (5) are connected via row3, col6. So perhaps this is a single large region.\n\n3. The group in row6, col0; row7, col0; row8, col0: three cells in a vertical line.\n\n4. The group in row7, cols3-4 (5s).\n\n5. The group in row7, col7; row8, col7.\n\nSo possibly multiple regions. \n\nIf the output numbers are based on the order of scanning (like first encountered region gets 1, etc.), then the numbers in the output would reflect that. Let's imagine scanning from bottom to top, left to right. \n\nLooking at the test input's rows from bottom (row9) up:\n\nRow9: all 0s. \n\nRow8: 5 at 0 and 7.\n\nRow7: 5s at 0,3-4,7.\n\nRow6: 5 at 0.\n\nSo the leftmost column (0) has 5s in rows6-8. That's a vertical line. So this region would be encountered first when scanning bottom-up, left-right. So maybe labeled 1.\n\nThen the next region would be in row7, cols3-4. Then row7, col7 and row8, col7. Then the col9 vertical line. Then the other groups in rows2-3.\n\nSo if the numbers are assigned in that order, the leftmost vertical line (rows6-8, col0) would be 1. The group in row7, cols3-4: 2. The group in row7-8, col7: 3. The col9 vertical line: 4. The other groups in rows2-3: 5. But the outputs in the training examples don't go beyond 3. So perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are based on the number of \"branches\" or the shape of the region. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers in the output are determined by the number of neighboring 5s in the input, but with a twist. Like, if a cell has exactly two adjacent 5s, it's a 2, etc. But example 0's cell (2,7) has two adjacent 5s (top and right), but output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's look at example 0's output again. For the cells that were 5 in the input, their output numbers are:\n\n- 1s: in a 2x2 block (rows1-2, cols7-8). Each of these cells has two adjacent 5s (e.g., cell (1,7) has (1,8) and (2,7) as 5s). But output is 1.\n\n- 2s: for example, row5, col9: input 5, output 2. Adjacent 5s are (row6, col9). So one neighbor.\n\n- 3s: row6, cols5-6: input 5s. Each has two adjacent 5s (each other and row7, cols5-6?). Wait, in example0's input, row6 has 5s at cols5-6. Row7 has 5s at cols0 and 9. So those are separate. Wait, then row6, col5-6's adjacent 5s are each other. So each has one adjacent 5. But output is 3. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This approach isn't working.\n\nAnother thought: the output numbers might represent different \"generations\" in a cellular automaton, but I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers indicate the order in which the cells would be visited in a BFS starting from the bottom-left corner. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers in the output are the count of 5s in the same row and column. For example, for a cell at (i,j), count the number of 5s in row i plus column j, excluding itself. Then maybe modulo 3 or something. Let's check example0's cell (1,7). Input is 5. Row 1 has 5s at 7,8. So row count is 2. Column7 has 5s at 1,2. So column count is 2. Total 4. But output is 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output number is the sum of the 5s in the eight neighboring cells. Let's test this:\n\nFor example0's cell (1,7):\n\nNeighbors: up (0,7) is 0.\n\nDown (2,7) is 5.\n\nLeft (1,6) is 0.\n\nRight (1,8) is 5.\n\nDiagonally: (0,6)=0, (0,8)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,8)=5.\n\nSo sum is 5 (down) +5 (right) +5 (diagonal down-right) = 3. But output is 1. So if sum is 3, maybe 3 mod 3 =0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, sum is 3, and output is 3. But example0's output is 1 here. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are the count of live neighbors in a Game of Life scenario, but that also doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother idea: in the training examples, the output numbers are smaller than 4. Maybe the numbers represent the number of connected 5s in the same region. For example, in a region of 4 cells, each cell is labeled 1. But in example0's output, the 2s are part of a region of 3 cells (row5-7, col9). So each cell there is 2. Wait, the vertical line in col9, rows5-7: three cells. So each would be 3? But example0's output for those cells is 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are based on the number of adjacent 5s in the output. But that's circular.\n\nWait, looking at the example0's output:\n\nThe 1s form a 2x2 block. Each 1 has two adjacent 1s (like in a square). The 2s are a vertical line of three cells. Each has two adjacent 2s (except the ends). The 3s are a horizontal block of two cells. Each has one adjacent 3. So perhaps the numbers in the output represent the count of same-number neighbors in the output. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output number is one less than the number of adjacent 5s in the input. For example, if a cell has two adjacent 5s, output 1. If three, output 2. But in example0's cell (1,7) has two adjacent 5s (down and right) and output 1. That fits. Let's check another cell. In example0's output, the cell (6,5) is 3. In the input, how many adjacent 5s? Let's see:\n\nCell (6,5) in input is 5. Adjacent cells:\n\nUp: (5,5) is 0.\n\nDown: (7,5) is 0.\n\nLeft: (6,4) is 0.\n\nRight: (6,6) is 5.\n\nSo in input, adjacent 5s: 1. Then output would be 0, but the output is 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at example0's output, the numbers 1, 2, 3 seem to be assigned to different regions. The 1s are in two separate regions (top right and middle left), but both labeled 1. The 2s are in the vertical line and another part. The 3s are in a horizontal block. So maybe the numbering is based on the shape of the region. For example, blocks of 2x2 are labeled 1, lines of 3 cells labeled 2, and other shapes labeled 3. But example0's vertical line of 3 cells is labeled 2. The horizontal block of two cells is labeled 1. Another vertical line (rows5-7, col9) labeled 2. The horizontal block in row6, cols5-6 labeled 3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are based on the direction of the region. Like, horizontal lines are 1, vertical lines are 2, other shapes 3. But in example0, the 2x2 block is labeled 1. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output numbers are layers, like in an onion. The outermost layer of a region is 1, next layer 2, etc. For example, a 2x2 block has only one layer, all 1. A 3x3 block would have outer layer 1 and center 2. But in example0's input, the 2x2 block is labeled 1. The vertical line of three cells would have ends labeled 1 and the middle 2. But in example0's output, the vertical line in col9 (rows5-7) are all 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are assigned based on the minimum number of steps to reach a certain type of cell. For example, distance from the edge of the grid. But not sure.\n\nLet me think differently. The input has 5s and 0s. The output replaces 5s with numbers 1, 2, 3. The 0s remain 0. So the transformation is only applied to the 5s. What's special about 5 in the input? Maybe the numbers in the output are based on the positions of the 5s in the input grid. For example, the sum of the row and column indices modulo 3 plus 1. Let's check example0's cell (1,7): row+col=8. 8 mod 3 is 2. 2+1=3. But output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output number is the row index modulo 3 plus 1. For cell (1,7): 1 mod3=1, output 1+0=1. But in example0's output, row6, col5-6 are 3. 6 mod3=0. So 0+1=1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the test input. The vertical line in col9, rows0-3. If in the output, these cells are labeled 1. Then the group in rows6-8, col0 would be 2. The group in row7, cols3-4 is 3. The group in row2-3, cols2-3,5-6 is maybe 4. But since the training examples only use 1-3, perhaps the numbers cycle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are based on the distance from the bottom of the grid. For example, the lower the cell, the higher the number. Let's see:\n\nIn example0's output, the 3s are in row6. The 2s are in rows5-7,9. The 1s are in higher rows. So perhaps rows closer to the bottom get higher numbers. But example0's row9 (bottom) has 2s. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output numbers are assigned based on the number of 5s in the same column. For example, if a column has more 5s, then cells in that column get a higher number. For example0's column7 has 5s in rows1-2,7-8. So 5 cells. But output has 1s and 3s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers represent the number of 5s in the same row. For example, in example0's row1 has two 5s. Output is 1. Row3 has two 5s. Output is 1. Row5 has one 5. Output is 2. Row6 has two 5s. Output is 3. Row7 has two 5s. Output is 3 and 2. So not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the number in the output is determined by the number of 5s in the row and column. For example, row + column count of 5s. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are assigned based on the number of times the cell is part of a 2x2 block of 5s. For example, cells that are part of a 2x2 block get 1, others get higher numbers. Let's check example0's input. The 2x2 block at rows1-2, cols7-8: output 1. The vertical line in rows5-7, col9: not a 2x2 block, so output 2. The horizontal block at row6, cols5-6: not a 2x2, so output 3. That fits. Let's check example1's input. The group in row8-9, cols0-2: this is a 2x3 region. So cells in 2x2 blocks would get 1. The output for row8, cols0-2: 1s. The group in row2, cols1-3 (3 5s in a row): not a 2x2 block, so labeled 2. The vertical line in row2-3, col7: two cells, labeled 3. So that fits. Then example2's input: the group in rows6-8, col0-1: this is a vertical line. So labeled 1. The group in row5, cols4-5 (2x1): labeled 3. The group in row1-2, col2-7: some structure. The output labels these as 3 and 2. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nBut if this is the pattern, then in the test input:\n\n- The group in rows6-8, col0: vertical line (not 2x2), so labeled 2.\n\n- The group in row7, cols3-4 (2x1): labeled 3.\n\n- The vertical line in col9, rows0-3: labeled 2.\n\n- The group in row2-3, cols2-3 and 5-6: perhaps a 2x2 block (row2, cols2-3 and row3, cols1-2 may form a 2x2 block if connected diagonally). If yes, those cells would be labeled 1. Then other groups get higher numbers.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's try to apply this to the test input.\n\nTest input's groups:\n\n1. Leftmost vertical line (rows6-8, col0): three cells. Not a 2x2 block. So labeled 2.\n\n2. The vertical line in col9, rows0-3: four cells. Not a 2x2 block. Labeled 2 or higher.\n\n3. The group in row7, cols3-4: two adjacent horizontal 5s. Not a 2x2 block. Labeled 3.\n\n4. The group in row2, cols2-3 and 5-6. Are they part of a 2x2 block? row2, cols2-3 are two cells. row3, cols1-2 and 6. For example, row3, col1-2: 5s. So the cell at row2, col2 is adjacent diagonally to row3, col1. If diagonally connected, this might form a larger region. So perhaps the cell at row2, col2-3 and row3, col1-2 form a 2x2 block. If yes, then those cells are labeled 1.\n\nSimilarly, row2, cols5-6 and row3, col6 form a T-shape. Not a 2x2 block. So labeled higher.\n\nSo if the rule is: cells in a 2x2 block of 5s are labeled 1, others are labeled based on the order encountered (e.g., next region gets 2, then 3, cycling after 3), then the test input's output might be:\n\n- The 2x2 block at rows2-3, cols1-2, 2-3 gets 1.\n\n- The vertical line in col0 (rows6-8) gets 2.\n\n- The vertical line in col9 (rows0-3) gets 3.\n\n- The group in row7, cols3-4 gets 2 (since it's next region).\n\nBut this is speculative. The training examples show that regions not in a 2x2 block are labeled 2 or 3. \n\nLooking back at example0's input:\n\n- The first two regions (2x2 blocks) are labeled 1.\n\n- The vertical line (non-2x2) is labeled 2.\n\n- The horizontal block (non-2x2) is labeled 3.\n\nExample1's input:\n\n- The group in row8, cols0-2 (part of a larger region) includes 2x2 blocks. So labeled 1.\n\n- The group in row2, cols1-3 (three in a row) is labeled 2.\n\n- The vertical line in col7 is labeled3.\n\nExample2's input:\n\n- The group in rows6-8, col0-1 (vertical line) is labeled1.\n\n- The group in row5, cols4-5 (horizontal) is labeled3.\n\n- The group in row1-2, cols6-7 (vertical line) is labeled2.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is:\n\n- Any cell that is part of a 2x2 block of 5s is labeled 1.\n\n- Other regions are labeled in the order they are encountered during scanning (left to right, top to bottom), starting from 2. If a region is encountered and is not a 2x2 block, assign the next number. However, in example0's output, the first non-2x2 region is labeled 2, then next is 3.\n\nSo in test input:\n\n- The first 2x2 block is the group in rows2-3 and cols1-2 and 2-3. This is a 2x2 block if the cells are connected. For example, row2, col2-3 and row3, col1-2. So yes, this forms a 2x2 block. So these cells are labeled 1.\n\n- Next, the vertical line in col0 (rows6-8) is encountered. Labeled 2.\n\n- Then the vertical line in col9 (rows0-3) is encountered. Labeled3.\n\n- The group in row7, cols3-4 (horizontal) is next. Labeled1 again? But training examples don't reuse numbers. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, once the numbers go up to 3, they cycle back to 1. But example0 has three different numbers. Example1 also uses 1, 2, 3. So in test input, after 3, next regions would be labeled 1 again. But how to determine the order.\n\nAlternatively, regions that are 2x2 blocks are labeled 1. Other regions are labeled 2 or 3 based on their shape. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming, but I need to make a guess. Let's try to apply this 2x2 block idea to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nLooking for 2x2 blocks of 5s:\n\n- In row2-3, cols2-3 and 1-2: yes. For example, row2, col2-3 and row3, col1-2 form a 2x2 block. So these cells are labeled 1.\n\n- Row7, cols3-4: horizontal two 5s, but no vertical. So no 2x2 block.\n\n- Row2, cols5-6 and row3, col6: forms a T-shape, not a 2x2.\n\n- The vertical line in col0 (rows6-8): no 2x2.\n\n- The vertical line in col9 (rows0-3): no 2x2.\n\nSo only one 2x2 block. So those cells are labeled 1.\n\nThen the other regions are labeled in the order they are encountered. Let's scan the input from top to bottom, left to right.\n\nRegions in order:\n\n1. The vertical line in col9, rows0-3.\n\n2. The group in row2, cols5-6 and row3, col6.\n\n3. The vertical line in col0, rows6-8.\n\n4. The group in row7, cols3-4.\n\n5. The group in row7-8, col7.\n\nSo after the 2x2 block (labeled 1), the next region (vertical line in col9) is labeled 2. Then the group in row2 cols5-6 labeled3. Then the col0 group labeled 1 again? But in the training examples, numbers don't repeat. So maybe after 3, it wraps back to 2. Or perhaps the order is based on when the region is first encountered during the scan.\n\nAlternatively, the order is determined by the first cell of the region encountered during the scan. Let's simulate:\n\nScanning the test input from top to bottom, left to right:\n\nRow0: col9 is 5. This is the first cell of the vertical line in col9. So region 1 (but 2x2 is labeled1, so other regions start from 2).\n\nWait, the first region encountered is the col9 vertical line. But since it's not a 2x2 block, it's labeled 2. Then the next region is the 2x2 block (encountered when scanning row2, col2). This is part of a 2x2 block, so labeled 1. Then the vertical line in col0 (row6, col0) is encountered next. Labeled 3. Then the group in row7, cols3-4: labeled2. Then row7, col7: labeled3.\n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nIn example0's output, the first region encountered (top right) is a 2x2 block, labeled 1. Then next is another 2x2 block labeled1. Then other regions labeled2,3. So perhaps all 2x2 blocks are labeled1 regardless of order, and others are labeled in the order of first encounter, starting from2. So in test input, the 2x2 block is labeled1. The vertical line in col9 (first encountered region) is labeled2. The vertical line in col0 (next new region) is labeled3. The group in row7, cols3-4 is labeled2 again (but numbers don't repeat in training examples). So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, after 3, it cycles to 1 again. So the first non-2x2 region is 2, then 3, then 1. But in example0, there are three non-2x2 regions (vertical line in col9, horizontal in row6, and vertical line in row5). But example0's output labels them as 2,3, and 2 again. So not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the numbers in the output are assigned as follows:\n\n- All cells that are part of a 2x2 block of 5s in the input are labeled1.\n\n- Other regions are labeled based on their order of appearance during a top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan, starting with 2. However, if a region is encountered and not a 2x2 block, it gets the next available number (2, then3, then wrapping back to2, etc).\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nThe only 2x2 block is in rows2-3, cols2-3 and 1-2. So those cells are labeled1.\n\nNext, during the scan, the first non-2x2 region encountered is the vertical line in col9 (rows0-3). Labeled2.\n\nThen, the group in row2, cols5-6 and row3, col6. This forms a connected region (assuming diagonal adjacency). This is labeled3.\n\nThen, the vertical line in col0 (rows6-8). Labeled2 again (since after 3 comes2).\n\nThe group in row7, cols3-4. Labeled3.\n\nThe group in row7-8, col7. Labeled2.\n\nThus, the output would have:\n\n- 1s in the 2x2 block.\n\n- 2s in col9's vertical line, col0's vertical line, and row7-8's col7.\n\n- 3s in the other groups.\n\nBut this is speculative. Let's try to construct the test input's output.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [0,0,5,5,0,5,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow3: [0,5,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5]\n\nRow4: all 0s.\n\nRow5: all 0s.\n\nRow6: [5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nRow8: [5,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nRow9: all 0s.\n\nProcessing:\n\n1. The 2x2 block in rows2-3, cols1-2 and 2-3 (assuming connected via diagonal). So cells (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2) are labeled1.\n\n2. The vertical line in col9, rows0-3: labeled2.\n\n3. The group in row2-3, cols5-6 and 6: labeled3.\n\n4. The vertical line in col0, rows6-8: labeled2.\n\n5. The group in row7, cols3-4: labeled3.\n\n6. The group in row7-8, col7: labeled2.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow2: [0,0,1,1,0,3,3,0,0,2]\n\nRow3: [0,1,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,2]\n\nRow4: all 0s.\n\nRow5: all 0s.\n\nRow6: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [2,0,0,3,3,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow8: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow9: all 0s.\n\nThis seems to fit the pattern seen in the training examples, where different regions are labeled with increasing numbers starting from1 for 2x2 blocks. However, I'm not entirely confident. But given the time, this is the best guess.",
