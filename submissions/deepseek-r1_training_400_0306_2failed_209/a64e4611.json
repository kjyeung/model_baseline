        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples, and then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the input and output arrays are almost the same except for some positions where the value changes to 3. For instance, in the fifth input row of Example 0, the input starts with [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8], and the output changes the 0s starting from index 9 to 3s: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8]. So from index 9 to 15 (assuming 0-based), the 0s are replaced by 3s. Similarly, in other rows, there's a stretch of 3s inserted in the middle of the array. \n\nWait, looking closer, maybe it's not exactly the middle. Let me check the indices. The first example in Example 0's input has the output where the 3s start at index 9 (the 10th element) and continue for 7 elements. So positions 9-15 are replaced with 3s. But in some rows, like the 6th input row of Example 0, the output starts replacing at index 9 again. Hmm, maybe there's a fixed position where the replacement occurs. Let's check another example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input rows have 3s inserted starting at index 6. For example, the first input row of Example 1 is [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0], and the output becomes [1,1,1,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0]. So here, starting at index 6 (7th element), the next 7 elements are replaced with 3s. So the position varies between examples. Wait, but in Example 0, the replacement starts at index 9, and in Example 1, it's index 6. So maybe the start position depends on some condition in the input.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input. Let's take the first input row of Example 2: [0,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0]. The output starts replacing at index 8 (9th element) with 3s: [0,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0]. So here, positions 8-15 are replaced. Wait, but the replacement length here is 8 elements (indices 8-15 inclusive, 8 elements). In Example 0, the replacement was 7 elements (indices 9-15, 7 elements?), no, wait in Example 0's first output row, from index 9 to 15, that's 7 elements (since 15-9+1=7). But in Example 2, the replacement is 8 elements (indices 8-15). So there's inconsistency here. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me count again.\n\nIn Example 0, the fifth input row in the output starts with 0 at index 9 (the 10th position) and replaces 7 elements: indices 9,10,11,12,13,14,15. That's seven 3s. In Example 1's first row, the 3s start at index 6 (7th element) and go for 7 elements (indices 6-12?), but looking at the example output: [1,1,1,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,1,0,1,0,...]. So indices 6-12 (positions 7-13) are 3s. That's 7 elements. Example 2's first output row has 8 elements replaced: indices 8-15 (8 elements) with 3s. So the number of replaced elements varies between examples. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nWait, maybe the start index is determined by the first occurrence of a certain pattern in the input. Alternatively, perhaps the replacement starts after a certain number of non-zero elements. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement occurs starting from the 9th element (index 8) in some cases and others. Wait, in Example 0's fifth row, the replacement starts at index 9. But in Example 2's first row, it starts at index 8. Maybe the start position is determined by the first occurrence of a sequence of zeros. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the input rows where the replacement occurs. For Example 0's fifth input row:\n\nInput: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\nThe output replaces starting at index 9 (value 0) with 3s. The input before that has a 0 at index 8 (the 9th element). Then from index 9 to 15, there are a bunch of zeros. So perhaps the replacement starts when there's a run of zeros, but how long does the run need to be?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement starts after the first non-zero element. Let's see. For Example 0's fifth input row: the first part is [0,8,0,0,0,8,8,8,0], then from index 9 onwards, zeros. But the replacement starts at index 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to a block of 7 consecutive zeros starting from a certain position. Wait, but in Example 0's fifth output, the replaced elements are 7 3s. In Example 1's first output, 7 3s. In Example 2's first output, 8 3s. Hmm, this inconsistency is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement is applied to a specific segment of the array, regardless of the content. Let's check the length of the array. All input and output arrays have 30 elements. Let's see the positions where 3s are inserted.\n\nIn Example 0, fifth row: 3s start at index 9 (10th element) and go to index 15 (7 elements). In Example 1, first row: 3s start at index 6 (7th element) and go to index 12 (7 elements). In Example 2, first row: 3s start at index 8 (9th element) and go to index 15 (8 elements). So the start index varies.\n\nWait, perhaps the start index is determined by the position of the first 0 after a certain point. Let me look for a pattern in the start of the replacement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement starts at the index where the first 0 occurs after the first non-zero elements. For example, in Example 0's fifth input row, after some initial elements, there's a 0 at index 8, and then the replacement starts at index 9. Wait, index 8 is 0, and the replacement starts at index 9. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement starts at the 9th element (index 8) in some examples. But in Example 0's fifth row, it starts at index 9. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the input rows and see if the replacement is applied to a specific segment that has all zeros. For example, in Example 0's fifth input row, the elements from index 9 to 15 are all zeros. The output replaces those with 3s. But in other rows, like the sixth input row of Example 0, the input has zeros from index 9 onwards, and those are replaced by 3s. Wait, but in some cases, like the tenth input row of Example 0, the input is [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the output replaces indices 9-15 with 3s, but then continues with more 3s. Wait, in that row, the output is [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]. So here, starting at index 9, all the way to the end, but that's more than 7 elements. So perhaps the replacement starts at a certain index and replaces a block of 7 elements, but sometimes if there are more zeros, they are also replaced. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement starts at the index where the first 0 occurs after a certain point, and replaces the next 7 elements with 3s, regardless of their original value. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input row: the replacement starts at index 9 (element 0), and replaces 7 elements (indices 9-15) with 3s. The original elements there were all zeros. In Example 0's sixth input row, the replacement starts at index 9 (element 0) and replaces 7 elements with 3s. In Example 1's first input row, the replacement starts at index 6 (element 0) and replaces 7 elements. So the start index varies, but the number of elements replaced is 7, except in Example 2 where it's 8. Wait, Example 2's first output row has 8 3s. Let me check that again.\n\nExample 2's first input row:\n\nInput: [0,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [0,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nHere, indices 8-15 are replaced with 3s (8 elements). So that's 8 elements. So why the difference? Maybe the replacement is for a block of 8 elements in some cases and 7 in others. That complicates the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement starts at the first occurrence of a 0 after a certain number of elements and replaces the next 7 or 8 elements. But this inconsistency is confusing.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output, in the seventh input row (index 7), the input is [1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and the output is [1,1,1,0,1,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]. Here, the replacement starts at index 6 and replaces all elements from there onwards with 3s, not just 7. So this suggests that once the replacement starts, all subsequent elements are 3s, but that's conflicting with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement starts at a certain index and continues until the end of the array, but in some cases, the original values are preserved after a certain point. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compare the input and output for each row across all examples to find a common pattern.\n\nIn all training examples, the output seems to replace a consecutive block of elements with 3s. The position and length of this block vary between examples, but perhaps the block is determined by a certain condition in the input.\n\nLooking at Example 0's fifth row again:\n\nInput: [0,8,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nOutput: [0,8,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nSo after the 0 at index 8 (the ninth element), there are 7 zeros starting at index 9. These are replaced by 3s. Then after index 15, the 0 at index 16 remains. So maybe the replacement occurs when there's a consecutive sequence of zeros (or maybe any elements) of length 7, starting at a certain position.\n\nIn Example 1's first row, the replacement starts at index 6 (element 0) and replaces 7 elements. The input at that position has a 0 followed by 6 zeros (indices 6-12). So 7 zeros replaced by 3s.\n\nIn Example 2's first row, the replacement starts at index 8 (element 0) and replaces 8 elements (indices 8-15). The input has 8 zeros starting at index 8. So perhaps the length of the replacement block is the same as the number of consecutive zeros (or other value?) starting from a certain point.\n\nWait, in Example 0's fifth row, the replaced elements are 7 zeros. In Example 1's first row, 7 zeros. In Example 2's first row, 8 zeros. So the number of 3s corresponds to the number of zeros in that segment. But then why in Example 0's fifth row, the output has exactly 7 3s, which matches the input's 7 zeros from index 9-15. So the replacement is replacing a consecutive block of zeros of certain length with 3s. But how is the start position determined?\n\nAlternatively, the start position is determined by the first occurrence of a 0 after a certain number of elements. For example, in Example 0's fifth row, the 0 at index 8 (ninth element) is followed by 7 zeros starting at index 9. So the replacement starts at index 9 and replaces the next 7 zeros with 3s.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe the pattern is: find the first occurrence of a 0, then check the next consecutive zeros. If there are at least 7 consecutive zeros starting at that position, replace those 7 with 3s. If there are more than 7, replace the first 7. Or maybe replace all consecutive zeros starting from that position. But looking at the examples:\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input row, the zeros from index 9-15 (7 elements) are replaced with 3s. The next element (index 16) is 0, which remains 0. So it's exactly 7 replaced. So perhaps the replacement is for the first 7 consecutive zeros starting from a certain position.\n\nBut how to determine where that position is. Let's look for the start position.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth row, the replacement starts at index 9. Before that, the elements are [0,8,0,0,0,8,8,8,0]. The 0 at index 8 is the first 0 after a series of non-zeros. Maybe the replacement starts after a certain number of non-zero elements or after a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement starts at index 9 (position 10) in some examples and index 6 (position 7) in others. Maybe the start index is determined by the position of the first 0 after the first third of the array. The array has 30 elements. So the first third is up to index 9 (since 30/3=10 elements). Hmm, but Example 0's fifth row starts at index 9, which is the end of the first third. Example 1's first row starts at index 6, which is in the first third. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement starts after the first occurrence of a non-zero element followed by a 0. For example, in Example 0's fifth input row, the 8 at index 8 is followed by a 0 at index 9. Wait, no: in the input, the index 8 is 0. Wait, maybe the start is after the first occurrence of a non-zero followed by a zero. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input row: the elements before the replacement are [0,8,0,0,0,8,8,8,0]. The 8 is at index 7 (element 8), followed by a 0 at index 8. Then the replacement starts at index 9. So perhaps after a non-zero (8) followed by a zero (index 8), the next zeros (starting at index 9) are replaced.\n\nBut in Example 1's first input row: the elements are [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0]. The replacement starts at index 6 (element 7). The elements before that are [1,1,1,0,0,0]. The first non-zero after that is not obvious. Maybe it's the first 0 after the first few elements. Hmm, this approach isn't clear.\n\nAnother angle: In all examples, the replacement seems to start around the middle of the array. Let's count the start indices:\n\nExample 0's fifth row: starts at 9 (0-based)\nExample 1's first row: starts at 6\nExample 2's first row: starts at 8\n\nThese vary. So maybe the start index is determined by some other factor, like the position of the first 0 after the first non-zero element in the array.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement starts at the 9th position (index 8) in some cases and at other positions in others, depending on the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input provided, maybe the pattern is to replace a block of 7 elements starting at index 9 (the tenth element) with 3s. But in the training examples, this isn't consistent. For example, in Example 1's first row, the replacement starts at index 6. So that can't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement occurs after the first occurrence of a sequence of four zeros. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input row, after index 8 (0), there are 7 zeros starting at 9. So perhaps after a certain number of zeros, but that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement starts after the first occurrence of three consecutive zeros. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's fifth input row has [0,8,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,...]. The first three consecutive zeros are at indices 2,3,4 (0,0,0). But the replacement starts at index 9. So that doesn't align.\n\nHmm. Maybe the replacement starts after the first occurrence of a 0 that is preceded by a non-zero. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input row, the 0 at index 9 is preceded by a 0 at index 8 (which is part of a longer sequence). Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is applied to a specific segment of the array regardless of content. For example, in the test input, maybe the same positions are replaced with 3s. But in the training examples, the replaced positions vary, so that can't be it.\n\nWait, looking at the test input provided:\n\nThe test input has 30-element arrays. For example, the first test input row is:\n\n[0,4,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nIf the pattern is to replace elements starting from index 9 with 3s for a certain length, say 7 elements, then the output would be:\n\n[0,4,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, index 9 is the 10th element, which is 0 in the input. Let's check if that's the case.\n\nBut how to determine the length. In some examples, it's 7, others 8. So perhaps the length is the number of zeros in that segment. But in the test input's first row, from index 9 onwards: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0]. Wait, starting at index 9 (element 10), the elements are 0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0. So from index 9, the first six elements are zeros (indices 9-14: 0,0,0,0,0,0), then index 15 is 4. So if the replacement is for 7 elements starting at index 9, that would be indices 9-15. But in the input, there are only six zeros (9-14), followed by 4 at 15. So the replacement would change indices 9-15 to 3s. But the 15th element is 4, so in the output, it becomes 3. So the output would have 7 3s from index 9 to 15.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's fifth input row, this seems to be the case: the input had 7 zeros, replaced by 3s. In the test input's first row, the input has 6 zeros followed by a 4. So would the replacement still apply 7 elements, even if some are non-zero? Let's see the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth row, the replacement was 7 3s, all of which were zeros in the input. But in Example 1's seventh input row, the replacement starts at index 6 and replaces elements regardless of their original value. For example, in Example 1's seventh input row, the output has 3s starting at index 6, even though the input may have non-zeros there. Wait, no, looking at Example 1's seventh input row:\n\nInput: [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [0,1,0,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nHere, the replacement starts at index 6 (element 7), which is 0, and replaces all elements from there to the end with 3s. So in this case, it's not just replacing zeros but any elements. So the replacement isn't based on the content but the position.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is to replace a fixed segment of the array with 3s, regardless of the original values. But the position and length vary between examples. This makes it difficult to find a consistent rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement starts at the first occurrence of a zero after the seventh element. For example, in Example 0's fifth row, the first zero after index 7 (element 8) is at index 8. The replacement starts at index 9. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In all training examples, the output arrays have a block of 3s in the middle. The test input's arrays are similar in structure. The challenge is to determine where to place the 3s.\n\nLooking at the test input's first row:\n\n[0,4,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nIf the pattern is to replace 7 elements starting from index 9 (as in Example 0), then the output would be:\n\n[0,4,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nBut I need to verify this against the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement starts after the first occurrence of a non-zero element. For example, in the test input's first row, after the first 4s, there's a 0 at index 8. So maybe the replacement starts at index 9. That would align with some of the training examples.\n\nBut how to confirm. Let's look at Example 0's fifth row again. The input starts with 0, then 8, then zeros and eights. The replacement starts at index 9. The element before that (index 8) is 0. So perhaps the replacement starts after a certain number of elements, regardless of content.\n\nAnother approach: The replacement occurs at a fixed position in the array. For example, in Example 0, the replacement starts at index 9. In Example 1, at index 6. In Example 2, at index 8. These positions are different. So this suggests that there's no fixed position. But perhaps the position is determined by the value of the elements in the array. For example, the first occurrence of a certain number. But the arrays have different values (8, 1, 2, 4), so that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement starts after the first occurrence of a certain number of non-zero elements. For example, after three non-zeros, replace the next 7 elements with 3s. But this is too vague.\n\nWait, let's count the number of non-zero elements before the replacement starts in each example.\n\nExample 0's fifth row: input starts with 0,8,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,... So before index 9 (the start of replacement), there are 4 non-zero elements (8,8,8,8). Hmm, but why 4?\n\nExample 1's first row: the input starts with 1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,... The replacement starts at index 6. The non-zero elements before that are 1,1,1, and 1 at index 14. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of non-zero elements before the replacement starts is not consistent.\n\nThis is getting quite complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Let's look for a pattern in the examples where the output has 3s inserted, and see if the position of the 3s corresponds to a segment of consecutive zeros in the input.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth row, the input has a run of 7 zeros starting at index 9. Output replaces them with 3s.\n\nIn Example 0's sixth row, input has a run of 7 zeros starting at index 9.\n\nIn Example 1's first row, input has a run of 7 zeros starting at index 6.\n\nIn Example 2's first row, input has a run of 8 zeros starting at index 8.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: find the first run of at least 7 consecutive zeros in the input and replace them with 3s. If there are more than 7, replace the first 7. But in Example 2's first row, the run is 8 zeros, and the output replaces 8 of them. Hmm, but in other examples, the replacement is exactly 7.\n\nWait, in Example 0's fifth row, the input has 7 zeros, replaced by 7 3s. In Example 2's first row, 8 zeros replaced by 8 3s. So maybe the rule is to replace the entire run of consecutive zeros, but only if it's at least 7 in length. Otherwise, do nothing.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's seventh row, the input has a long run of zeros starting at index 6, and the output replaces them all with 3s. So perhaps any run of zeros of length >=7 is replaced with 3s, covering the entire run.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's tenth input row:\n\nInput: [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\nHere, the run of zeros starts at index 9 and continues to the end. The output replaces them all with 3s, even though the run is longer than 7. So the pattern might be: replace any consecutive zeros of length >=7 with 3s, starting from the beginning of the run, and continuing to the end of the run. But how to confirm.\n\nIn Example 1's seventh row, the input has a long run of zeros starting at index 6. The output replaces all of them with 3s. So the entire run is replaced.\n\nSo the rule could be: In each array, find the first run of consecutive zeros that is at least 7 elements long and replace all elements in that run with 3s. If there are multiple such runs, only the first one is replaced.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFor each row in the test input, we need to find the first run of 7 or more consecutive zeros and replace them with 3s.\n\nLet's take the first test input row:\n\n[0,4,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0]\n\nLooking for runs of 7 or more zeros. The zeros are at positions:\n\n- index 0: 0\n- index 3: 0\n- index 5: 0\n- indices 8-13: 0,0,0,0,0,0 (6 zeros)\n- indices 19-21: 0,0,0 (3)\n- index 23: 0\n- indices 27-29: 0,0,0\n\nThe longest run is 6 zeros (indices 8-13). Not 7. So no run of 7 or more zeros. Therefore, no replacement. But this contradicts the training examples where replacements were made even for exactly 7 zeros. Wait, but in the first test input row, the run is 6 zeros, which is less than 7, so no replacement. But in the training examples, some replacements were made for runs of exactly 7.\n\nBut looking back, in Example 0's fifth row, the run was 7 zeros (indices 9-15). So replaced. In the test input's first row, there's a run of 6 zeros. So no replacement. But according to the problem statement, the test input should follow the same pattern as the training examples. However, maybe the test input has a different scenario.\n\nWait, but looking at the other rows in the test input. Let's check the second test input row:\n\n[4,4,4,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,4,4]\n\nHere, the zeros start at index 3 (0), then index 4 (0), then indices 8-13 (0,0,0,0,0,0,0) \u2014 that's 7 zeros. So this run would be replaced with 3s.\n\nSimilarly, other rows in the test input may have runs of 7 or more zeros.\n\nSo the rule is: For each array, find the first occurrence of a run of 7 or more consecutive zeros. Replace all elements in that run with 3s. If no such run exists, leave the array unchanged.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFirst row: no run of 7 zeros. So no change.\n\nSecond row: run of 7 zeros (indices 8-14). Replace with 3s.\n\nThird row: let's check.\n\nThird test input row:\n\n[0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,4,0,0,4]\n\nLooking for runs of 7 zeros. The run from index 1-4: no, since 0,0,0,4. Then after that, at index 5-8: 0,0,0,0,4 (index 5-8: zeros at 5-7 (3 zeros)). Then index 9-10:4,4. Then indices 11-14:0,0,0,0 (4 zeros). Then 15:4. So the longest run is 4 zeros. So no replacement.\n\nFourth row:\n\n[4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4]\n\nLooking for runs: index 1-3: three zeros. Then index 8:4. index 9-13:0,0,0,0,0 (5 zeros). Then index 19-25:0,0,0,0,0,0,0 (7 zeros). So this run starts at index 19 and has 7 zeros. So replace them with 3s.\n\nSo the output for this row would have 3s from index 19-25.\n\nContinuing this way for each row in the test input.\n\nBut wait, looking at the training examples, in Example 0's tenth row, the entire tail is replaced because the run of zeros starts at index 9 and continues to the end (22 zeros), so all are replaced with 3s. So the rule is that any run of 7 or more zeros, even if longer, is replaced entirely with 3s.\n\nThus, the pattern is: in each array, replace the first sequence of seven or more consecutive zeros with 3s. If there is no such sequence, leave the array unchanged.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nLet's process each test input row:\n\n1. First test input row:\n[0,4,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0]\nThe longest run of zeros is 6 (indices 8-13). So no replacement. Output same as input.\n\n2. Second row:\n[4,4,4,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,4,4]\nRun of 7 zeros from indices 8-14 (elements 9-15). Replace with 3s.\n\n3. Third row:\n[0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,4,0,0,4]\nLongest run is 4 zeros. No replacement.\n\n4. Fourth row:\n[4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4]\nRun of 7 zeros from indices 19-25. Replace with 3s.\n\n5. Fifth row:\n[4,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,4,0]\nLooking for runs. For example, indices 7-13:0,0,4,0,0,0,0. Not consecutive. Or indices 9-15:0,0,0,0,0,0,0 (7 zeros). So replace indices 9-15 with 3s.\n\n6. Sixth row:\n[0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nLooking for runs. Indices 3-9:0,0,0,4,4,0. Not. Indices 10-14:0,0,0,0,4 (4 zeros). Indices 19-25:0,0,0,0,0,4,0 (5 zeros). Indices 25-29:0,0,0,0,0 (5 zeros). No run of 7. So no replacement.\n\n7. Seventh row:\n[4,0,4,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4]\nRun of 7 zeros? Let's see. Indices 5-8:0,0,4,0 (only 2 zeros). Indices 8-14:0,4,0,0,0,0,4 (zeros at 8, 10-13: 4 zeros). Indices 19-22:0,0,0,0 (4 zeros). No run of 7. No replacement.\n\n8. Eighth row:\n[0,4,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]\nLooking for runs. Indices 8-14:0,0,0,0,0,0,0 (7 zeros). Replace with 3s.\n\n9. Ninth row:\n[0,0,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0]\nRun of zeros: indices 9-14:0,0,0,0,0 (5 zeros). Then indices 20-25:0,0,0,0,0,0 (6 zeros). No 7. No replacement.\n\n10. Tenth row:\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nThis entire row is zeros. So run of 30 zeros. Replace all with 3s.\n\nBut wait, the training examples have some rows where all zeros are replaced. For example, Example 0's tenth row input had a long run of zeros starting at index 9, and the output replaced from index 9 onwards. But in this test row, the entire array is zeros, so the first run is the entire array. Replace the first 7 or more zeros. Since the entire array is zeros, replace all with 3s.\n\n11. Eleventh row:\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nSame as tenth row. Replace all with 3s.\n\n12. Twelfth row:\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nSame. Replace all with 3s.\n\n13. Thirteenth row:\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nSame. Replace all with 3s.\n\n14. Fourteenth row:\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nSame. Replace all with 3s.\n\n15. Fifteenth row:\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nSame. Replace all with 3s.\n\n16. Sixteenth row:\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nSame. Replace all with 3s.\n\n17. Seventeenth row:\n[0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,4,4]\nLooking for runs. For example, indices 0-5:0,4,0,0,0,0. Not. Indices 3-9:0,0,0,0,0,4,0. So run of 5 zeros. No replacement.\n\n18. Eighteenth row:\n[4,4,0,4,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,0]\nLooking for runs. Indices 5-10:0,0,4,0,0,0 (zeros at 5-6, 8-10: total of 5).

Nineteenth row:\n[0,0,4,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\nRun of zeros: indices 9-15:0,0,0,0,0,0,0 (7 zeros). Replace with 3s.\n\n20. Twentieth row:\n[0,4,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,0]\nRun of zeros: indices 6-13:0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 (8 zeros). Replace with 3s.\n\n21.

Twenty-second row:\n[4,0,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,4]\nRun of zeros: indices 5-11:0,0,0,4,0,0,0 (zeros at 5-7, 9-11: total of 6). No. Indices 13-19:0,0,4,4,0,0,0 (3 zeros). Indices 19-24:0,0,0,0,0,4 (5 zeros). No replacement.\n\n23. Twenty-third row:\n[4,0,4,4,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4]\nRun of zeros: indices 8-14:0,0,0,0,0,0,0 (7 zeros). Replace with 3s.\n\n24.

Indices 19-22:0,0,0,0 (4). No replacement.\n\n27. Twenty-seventh row:\n[0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0]\nRun of zeros: indices 5-9:0,0,0,0,4 (4).

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is that given a list of input arrays, we need to transform them into output arrays following the same pattern as the training examples. Let's look at the examples to find the rule.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input and output arrays are mostly the same, but in some rows, there's a sequence of 3s starting at a certain position. For instance, in the fifth input row of Example 0, the original input has a bunch of 0s starting from index 9. The output replaces those 0s with 3s from index 9 up to index 15, then back to 0. Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal input row 5 in Example 0:\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\nOutput row 5:\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\nSo from index 9 (which is the 10th element, since indexing starts at 0), there are seven 3s. Then index 16 is back to 0. Hmm. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input rows also have sequences replaced with 3s. For example, the first input row of Example 1:\n\nInput:\n[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nHere, starting at index 6 (7th element), seven 3s are inserted. Then index 13 is 0 again.\n\nWait, in both examples, the 3s start at a certain index and replace a block of consecutive elements. Let's see if there's a consistent starting index. Looking at the first example's fifth input row: the 3s start at index 9. In the second example's first row, they start at index 6. Hmm, maybe the position where the 3s start varies. So what determines where the 3s are placed?\n\nLooking at another row in Example 0. The sixth input row:\n\nInput:\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8]\n\nOutput:\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8]\n\nHere, the 3s start at index 9 again. So maybe the starting index is 9 in some cases, but in Example 1's first row, they start at index 6. Wait, maybe it's not a fixed index. Let's check the length of the arrays. All input and output arrays have 30 elements. So each array is of length 30.\n\nLooking for a pattern in the position where the 3s are inserted. Let's take the first example's fifth input row again. The original elements from index 9 to 15 (inclusive) are all 0s. The output replaces these with 3s. So maybe whenever there are seven consecutive 0s starting at a certain position, they are replaced by 3s. But how to determine where?\n\nWait, in Example 0, row 5: the original elements from index 9 to 15 (indices 9-15 inclusive) are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0. That's seven 0s. So they are replaced with seven 3s. Similarly, in Example 1's first row, the elements at indices 6-12 are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Seven 0s, replaced by 3s. \n\nAh! So the pattern is: in each array, starting from a certain index, if there are seven consecutive zeros, replace them with seven 3s. But how to determine the starting index? Because in some rows, like Example 0's row 10, the input has a longer sequence of zeros. Let me check:\n\nExample 0, row 10 input:\n\n[8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\nWait, here the 3s start at index 9 and continue till the end. But in the original input, from index 9 onwards, there are a lot of zeros. So the first seven zeros (indices 9-15) would be replaced by 3s, but the output shows that even beyond index 15, they are replaced. Hmm, that's conflicting with the previous idea. Wait, in the output of row 10, the 3s start at index 9 and continue to index 29. So 21 elements of 3s. So perhaps the rule is different here.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is to replace a block of seven zeros starting from the first occurrence after a certain position. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first few rows:\n\nIn row 0 of Example 0, the input is [8,8,0...] and the output is the same. So no replacement. Because maybe there's no seven consecutive 0s in the right place.\n\nRow 5 of Example 0: the input has seven 0s from index 9 to 15. So replaced by 3s.\n\nRow 6: input has seven 0s from index 9 to 15 again. Replaced by 3s.\n\nRow 10: the input starts with 8,0,8,8,0,0,8,8,0 followed by many 0s. The output replaces from index 9 onwards with 3s. But how many? The original zeros start at index 9. So maybe whenever there's a run of at least seven 0s starting at index 9, replace those seven with 3s, but in row 10, the entire rest of the array after index 9 is zeros, so they are replaced all the way. But the output for row 10 has 3s from index 9 to 29. That's more than seven. So maybe once seven zeros are found starting at index 9, replace the entire span of consecutive zeros (possibly longer than seven) with 3s? Or maybe the replacement is a fixed block of seven 3s, but if the original zeros are longer than seven, then the rest remain zeros. Wait, let's check.\n\nIn Example 0 row 5: input has seven 0s at 9-15. Output replaces them with 3s, and the next element is 0 (index 16). So in that case, exactly seven 3s.\n\nIn row 10 of Example 0: the input has zeros from index 9 onwards. The output has 3s from index 9 to 29. So all those positions are 3s. So perhaps the replacement is not limited to seven 3s, but starts at the first occurrence of seven consecutive 0s and replaces the entire block of consecutive 0s starting from index 9, regardless of length.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: find the first occurrence of seven consecutive 0s in the array. Once found, replace all consecutive 0s starting from the beginning of that seven with 3s. But in the first example's row 5, the seven 0s are followed by a non-zero, so only seven are replaced. In row 10, the seven are part of a longer run, so all consecutive 0s from index 9 onward are replaced with 3s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement starts at a fixed position. Let's check where the 3s start in each example.\n\nLooking at the first example's row 5: 3s start at index 9.\n\nRow 6: index 9.\n\nRow 7: index 9.\n\nRow 8: index 9.\n\nRow 9: index 9.\n\nRow 10: index 9.\n\nSo in all these cases, the 3s start at index 9. So the starting position is fixed at index 9, and the next seven elements are replaced with 3s. But in row 10 of example 0, the output has 3s starting at index 9 and continuing beyond seven. For example, the input row 10 has:\n\n[8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\nSo starting at index 9 (element 10th), they replace from 9 to 29. So all 22 elements from 9 to 29 (indices 9 to 29) are replaced with 3s, even though the original zeros start at 9 and go all the way. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: starting at index 9, replace the next seven elements with 3s, regardless of their original values. But in some cases, the original elements are zeros. For example, in row 5 of example 0, the seven elements starting at 9 are zeros. So they are replaced. But in other cases, if the elements are not zeros, maybe they are still replaced. Wait, let's check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1's first input row:\n\nInput:\n[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nOutput:\n[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nHere, the 3s start at index 6 (the 7th element), which is earlier than 9. So that contradicts the previous idea. So perhaps the starting index isn't fixed. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the position where the 3s start depends on the first occurrence of a 0 followed by six more 0s. Let's see. For Example 0's row 5, the input starts at index 9 with seven 0s. So replace them with 3s. In Example 1's first row, the first occurrence of seven consecutive 0s starts at index 6. So they replace from there. But in Example 0's row 10, the seven 0s start at index 9. So they start replacing from index 9, but the output continues beyond seven.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is to find the first run of seven 0s and replace them with 3s. But in some cases, the run is longer than seven, like in row 10 of Example 0, but the output replaces all the consecutive 0s with 3s once the seven are found. Wait, no. Because in row 10, after the seven 0s, there are more zeros, and all are replaced. So perhaps the rule is: once a run of seven or more 0s is found, replace the entire run (all consecutive 0s) with 3s, starting from the beginning of the run. But how does that fit with Example 0's row 5, where exactly seven 0s are replaced with seven 3s.\n\nBut in Example 1's first row, the run starts at index 6 (elements 6 to 12 are seven 0s). So they are replaced with 3s, but elements 13 and beyond may not be zeros. In the output, element 13 is 0, which was a 0 in the input. So it seems that only the first seven are replaced.\n\nWait, no. In Example 1's first row output, the 3s are from index 6 to 12 (7 elements). The next element at index 13 is 0, which matches the input. So that's exactly seven 3s. So perhaps the rule is to replace the first run of seven consecutive 0s with seven 3s. But in Example 0's row 10, the input has a run of 22 zeros starting at index 9. The output replaces all of them with 3s. But according to the previous logic, only seven should be replaced. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, in Example 0's row 10 input:\n\nOriginal input has from index 9 onwards all zeros. The output replaces from index 9 to the end with 3s. So that's 22 elements. So why in this case all are replaced?\n\nHmm. Let's check another example. Looking at Example 0's row 21:\n\nInput row 21:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nOutput row 21:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nSo here, the input starts with 17 zeros (indices 0-16), and the output replaces the first 16 elements with 3s, but element 16 is 0. Wait, but the input's first 17 elements are zeros. The output shows that elements 0-15 are 3s, and element 16 is 0. So that's 16 3s, which is more than seven. So this contradicts the previous idea.\n\nWait, but the output has 16 3s followed by 0. So the input had 17 zeros. So why only 16 replaced? Maybe there's a different pattern here. Alternatively, maybe the replacement starts at a certain index and replaces a certain number of elements regardless of their values.\n\nLooking at Example 0's row 21 input: the first 17 elements are 0. The output has 16 3s followed by 0. So that's 16 3s. But 16 is 8*2, which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done in blocks of seven starting from a certain index. But this is getting confusing.\n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output for each example and see where exactly the 3s are inserted. Let's look for the first occurrence where the output changes to 3s.\n\nIn Example 0's row 5:\n\nInput indices 9-15: 0s. Output: 3s. So seven 3s.\n\nRow 6: indices 9-15: 0s. Output: 3s.\n\nRow 7: indices 9-15: 0s. Output: 3s.\n\nRow 8: indices 9-15: 0s. Output: 3s.\n\nRow 9: indices 9-15: 0s. Output: 3s.\n\nRow 10: indices 9-15: 0s. Output: 3s. But in the output, after index 15, the elements are also 3s. Wait, no. Looking at row 10's output:\n\n[8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\nSo starting at index 9, all elements are 3s. The input has zeros from index 9 onwards. So perhaps when the first seven zeros at positions 9-15 are replaced with 3s, but then the code continues replacing all zeros from index 9 onwards. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: starting at index 9, replace the next seven elements with 3s, regardless of their original values. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0 row 5: indices 9-15 (seven elements) are 0s. Replaced with 3s.\n\nRow 6: same indices 9-15: 0s replaced with 3s.\n\nRow 10: indices 9-15 replaced with 3s, but also the rest of the elements (indices 16-29) are replaced with 3s. Wait, but why? The input for row 10 has zeros from index 9 onwards. If the rule is to replace seven elements starting at 9, why are the rest replaced?\n\nThis is confusing. Let's look for another pattern. All the outputs in the training examples have 3s inserted in certain positions, but how?\n\nAlternative idea: For each array, the 3s start at the 10th element (index 9) and span seven elements. So indices 9 to 15 inclusive are replaced with 3s. Let's check:\n\nExample 0 row 5: yes, indices 9-15 replaced.\n\nRow 6: same.\n\nRow 7: same.\n\nRow 8: same.\n\nRow 9: same.\n\nRow 10: Wait, no. In row 10's output, indices 9-29 are 3s. So that's beyond 15. So this contradicts the idea.\n\nBut maybe in some cases, after replacing indices 9-15, if there are more zeros, they are also replaced. Hmm. But how to explain that.\n\nLooking at Example 0 row 10's input: after index 15 (element 16), there are more zeros. But in the output, element 16 is 3 as well. So perhaps the replacement is not just seven elements, but continues as long as there are zeros. For example, after replacing indices 9-15 with 3s, if the next elements are zeros, they are also replaced. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement starts at index 9 and replaces all consecutive zeros starting from there with 3s, regardless of how many there are. So the trigger is the position index 9. If the element at index 9 is 0, replace it and all consecutive zeros starting from there with 3s. So in Example 0's row 5, index 9 is 0, and the next six elements (9-15) are also zeros. So they are replaced. In row 10, index 9 is 0, and all subsequent elements are zeros, so they are all replaced with 3s.\n\nBut in Example 1's first row, the 3s start at index 6, which would contradict this. Wait, but no. Wait, Example 1's first row output starts 3s at index 6. So this suggests that the trigger position varies. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the position where the 3s start is determined by the first occurrence of seven consecutive zeros. So wherever the first seven consecutive zeros start, replace them with 3s. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0 row 5: the first seven zeros start at index 9.\n\nExample 1 row 0: the first seven zeros start at index 6.\n\nExample 2 row 0: the first seven zeros start at index 8 (elements 8-14 are zeros). So in the output, they are replaced with 3s starting at index 8. Let's check:\n\nExample 2's first input row:\n\nInput: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWait, the input has zeros starting at index 8 (element 9th) to index 15 (element 16th). So eight zeros. The output has 3s from index 8 to 14 (seven elements), then index 15 is 3 as well? Wait, no, let me count:\n\nIndices 8-14: 7 elements (indices 8 to 14 inclusive). The output has 3s from 8 to 14, but index 15 is also 3. So that's eight 3s. But according to the input, indices 8-15 (inclusive) are zeros (8 elements). So perhaps the rule is to replace the first seven zeros in the run, but in this case, the output has eight 3s. So this theory may not hold.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a different approach.\n\nLooking at all three examples, the common pattern is that in each input array, a block of elements (of varying lengths) is replaced with 3s (or 3s and other numbers in other examples?), and the rest remain the same. The key is to determine where and how this replacement happens.\n\nAnother observation: in all training examples, the replacement block is always made of 3s, regardless of the original elements. So it's not dependent on the original value. For example, in Example 2's first input row, the elements replaced are zeros, but in other cases, maybe they could be other numbers. But in all training examples, the replaced elements are zeros. So perhaps the rule is to replace a block of zeros with 3s.\n\nBut how to determine the position and length of the block.\n\nLooking at Example 0's row 21: the input has a long run of zeros starting from index 0. The output has 3s from index 0 to 15, then 0 at index 16. The input's zeros start from 0 to 16, but the output replaced the first 16 elements with 3s. But 16 is 7*2 + 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement starts at the first occurrence of a 0 and replaces the next seven elements with 3s. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's row 5: first 0 is at index 2, but the replacement is at index 9. So this can't be.\n\nHmm. Another idea: maybe the replacement starts at index 9 (the tenth element) and replaces the next seven elements with 3s, regardless of their values. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's row 5, indices 9-15 are replaced with 3s. That matches.\n\nRow 6: same.\n\nRow 7: same.\n\nRow 8: same.\n\nRow 9: same.\n\nRow 10: indices 9-15 replaced, but the output shows all from 9 onward are 3s. So this contradicts, because if the rule is to replace seven elements, then only 9-15 would be 3s, but in row 10, the output has 3s beyond index 15. So this theory is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to replace the elements starting at index 9 with 3s until the end of the array. But that can't be, because in some rows, like row 5 of example 0, after index 15, there are non-3s. For example, row 5's output has index 16 as 0. So that's not replaced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is to replace a certain number of elements starting at index 9. For example, seven elements. But then in row 10 of example 0, they replaced more than seven. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAnother approach: look at the test input and see if we can apply the same pattern. The test input uses the number 4. Maybe the pattern is to replace a block of seven 0s with the number 3, but for the test input, perhaps replace with 4s? No, because in the training examples, the replacement is 3 regardless of the other numbers. Wait, but in the test input, the numbers are 0s and 4s. So maybe the rule is to replace a certain block of 0s with 3s (or maybe with a different number, but in the training examples, it's always 3).\n\nBut in the test input, the test arrays may need to have their 0s replaced with 3s in a similar way.\n\nWait, but in the training examples, the replacement is always 3, regardless of the other numbers in the array. For example, in Example 0, the arrays have 8 and 0, replaced with 3s. In Example 1, 1 and 0, replaced with 3s. In Example 2, 2 and 0, replaced with 3s. So the number used for replacement is always 3, regardless of the other numbers in the array.\n\nSo the pattern is: in each array, find a certain block of zeros and replace them with 3s.\n\nThe key is to find where that block is.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's row 0: no replacement. So there's no block of seven zeros.\n\nRow 5: replacement at indices 9-15 (7 zeros).\n\nRow 10: replacement starts at index 9 and continues to the end (but why? Because the zeros start at 9 and are more than seven? Or perhaps the entire array after index 9 is replaced? Or perhaps after index 9, all zeros are replaced, regardless of how many).\n\nAlternatively, the replacement starts at the first occurrence of seven consecutive zeros, and replaces the entire run of zeros (including any leading zeros before the seven, but that doesn't make sense). For example, if the seven consecutive zeros start at index 6, then replace from the start of that run. But in Example 0's row 10, the run starts at index 9, so replace from there.\n\nBut how to determine where the seven consecutive zeros are.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is always seven 3s starting at index 9. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's row 5, starting at 9, seven 3s.\n\nRow 6: same.\n\nRow 7: same.\n\nRow 8: same.\n\nRow 9: same.\n\nRow 10: the input has zeros from index 9 onwards. The output has 3s from 9 to 29. So 21 3s. But why? If the rule is to replace seven elements starting at 9, then only 9-15 should be 3s, but the output has more. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's row 10, the output is:\n\n[8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\nSo starting at index 9, all elements are 3s. The input at index 9 is 0. So maybe the rule is to replace all zeros from index 9 onwards with 3s, regardless of how many. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 0's row 5: after index 9, there are seven zeros. Output has 3s there. The next element is 0 (index 16), which remains 0. So this contradicts the theory.\n\nBut wait, in row 5's input, index 9 is 0, and the next elements are 0s up to index 15. Index 16 is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. So why wasn't that replaced? Because the rule is to replace only the first seven zeros starting at index 9. So indices 9-15 are replaced, and index 16 is not part of the seven, so left as 0.\n\nBut in row 10's input, the zeros start at index 9 and continue to the end. So the output replaces all of them. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Let's look for another pattern. \n\nIn the training examples, all the replacement blocks start at index 9. For Example 0, rows 5-10 start at 9. In Example 1, the first replacement starts at index 6. Example 2's first replacement starts at index 8. So no fixed position.\n\nAlternative idea: the replacement occurs at the first occurrence of a run of seven zeros, regardless of their position in the array. The entire run of zeros (not just seven) is replaced with 3s. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's row 5: seven zeros starting at 9. Replaced with 3s. The next element (index 16) is 0, which is not part of the run. So replaced only the seven.\n\nExample 0's row 10: run of 22 zeros starting at 9. Replaced all with 3s.\n\nExample 1's first row: run of seven zeros starting at 6. Replaced with 3s. The next element (index 13) is 0, which is not part of the run. So replaced seven.\n\nExample 2's first row: run of eight zeros starting at index 8. Replaced with seven 3s? No, in the output, indices 8-15 are 3s (eight elements). So replaced eight zeros with eight 3s. But according to the theory, we should replace the entire run. So in this case, the run is eight zeros. So replaced all eight with 3s. But the replacement is seven 3s. No. Wait, the output for Example 2's first row is:\n\n[0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo indices 8-15 are 3s (eight elements). The input had zeros from 8-15. So replaced eight zeros with eight 3s. So the theory that the entire run of zeros (of at least seven) is replaced with 3s holds here. \n\nSimilarly, in Example 0's row 10, the entire run of zeros from 9 to 29 is replaced with 3s.\n\nIn Example 1's first row: seven zeros from 6-12 replaced with 3s. The next element is 0, but since it's not part of the consecutive run, it's not replaced.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: in each array, find the first occurrence of a run of seven or more consecutive zeros. Replace all elements in that run with 3s. So even if the run is longer than seven, replace all. If there are multiple runs, only the first such run is replaced. If there are no runs of seven or more zeros, leave the array unchanged.\n\nLet's test this theory:\n\nExample 0's row 0: no run of seven zeros. So output is same as input.\n\nExample 0's row 5: first run of seven zeros starts at 9. Replaced with 3s.\n\nExample 0's row 10: first run starts at 9. Replaced with 3s.\n\nExample 1's first row: first run starts at 6. Replaced.\n\nExample 2's first row: first run starts at 8. Replaced.\n\nExample 0's row 21: input starts with 17 zeros. So the first run of seven starts at 0. But the output replaces the first 16 zeros with 3s, then has a 0. Wait, the input has 17 zeros. The output has 3s from 0 to 15 (16 elements) and 0 at 16. That's conflicting with the theory. Because the run is 17 zeros, so replacing the entire run would replace all 17 with 3s. But the output has 3s until index 15, then 0 at 16. So this contradicts the theory.\n\nSo this theory is not correct.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the replacement is to replace the first seven consecutive zeros found in the array, replacing them with 3s, regardless of their position. The rest of the array remains unchanged.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample 0's row 5: seven zeros at 9-15. Replaced with 3s.\n\nExample 0's row 21: input has 17 zeros. The first seven are at 0-6. So replaced with 3s. But the output for row 21 is:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nSo the first 16 elements are 3s. But according to the theory, only the first seven would be replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the length of the 3s sequences:\n\nIn Example 0's row 5: 7 3s.\n\nRow 6: 7.\n\nRow 7: 7.\n\nRow 8: 7.\n\nRow 9: 7.\n\nRow 10: 22.\n\nRow 21: 16.\n\nExample 1's first row:7.\n\nExample 2's first row:8.\n\nThere's no consistency in the number of 3s.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's row 21, the input has 17 zeros. The output has 16 3s followed by 0. So maybe the replacement is to replace the first 16 zeros. Why 16? Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In all the training examples, the 3s start at index 9 in the majority of the rows. So perhaps the replacement is to replace the elements from index 9 to 15 (seven elements) with 3s, regardless of their values. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's row 5: indices 9-15 replaced with 3s.\n\nRow 6: same.\n\nRow 7: same.\n\nRow 8: same.\n\nRow 9: same.\n\nRow 10: indices 9-15 replaced with 3s. But the output shows that indices 9-29 are 3s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample 0's row 10's input after replacement would have indices 9-15 as 3s, and the rest as 0s. But the output shows all as 3s. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the replacement starts at index 9 and replaces all elements from there to the end with 3s. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's row 5: index 9-29 replaced. But the output has 3s only up to index 15, then 0. So this is not the case.\n\nHmm. Let's try to think differently. Perhaps the replacement is to replace the 8th to 14th elements (indices 7-13) with 3s. But in Example 0's row 5, the replacement starts at index 9.\n\nWait, this is not leading anywhere. Let's try to find the pattern based on the test input.\n\nThe test input has a series of arrays. For example, the first test input array is:\n\n[0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLooking for a run of seven zeros. Are there any consecutive seven 0s in this array?\n\nLooking at the elements:\n\nIndices 8-14: 0,0,0,0,0,0,4. So from index 8 to 13 (six zeros), then index 14 is 4. So not seven.\n\nThe next possible run: indices 19-21: 0,0,0. Not enough.\n\nSo no seven zeros in a row. So according to the previous theory, no replacement. So the output would be the same as input. But wait, let's look at other test input arrays.\n\nAnother test input array:\n\n[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4]\n\nHere, indices 8-14: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Seven zeros. So this would be replaced with 3s. So the output for this array would have 3s from indices 8 to 14.\n\nBut according to the training examples, the replacement is 3s, regardless of the other numbers. So in this case, the first occurrence of seven consecutive zeros is at indices 8-14. So replaced with 3s. The rest of the array remains.\n\nAnother test array:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis has a run of 30 zeros. So replaced with 3s starting from the first seven, but according to the previous examples, the entire run would be replaced. So the output would be all 3s.\n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples?\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to replace the first run of seven consecutive zeros with 3s. So in this test array, the first seven would be replaced, and the rest remain zeros. But in Example 0's row 10, the entire run is replaced. So this contradicts.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let's try to find another angle. Looking at the position where the replacement starts in the training examples:\n\n- Example 0's rows 5-10: replacement starts at index 9.\n\n- Example 1's rows: replacement starts at index 6.\n\n- Example 2's rows: replacement starts at index 8.\n\nSo the starting index varies. What's common among these indices? \n\nLooking at the input arrays:\n\nIn Example 0's row 5, the elements before index 9 are non-zero. So perhaps the replacement starts at the first run of seven zeros after a certain point.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement starts at the first occurrence of a 0 that is followed by six more 0s. So the starting index is the first position where there are seven consecutive 0s, and the replacement is those seven 0s replaced by 3s.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 10, the replacement starts at index 9 and continues beyond seven, so this theory doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is to replace the first seven consecutive 0s with 3s, regardless of where they are in the array. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's row 5: seven 0s at 9-15 \u2192 replaced.\n\nExample 0's row 10: seven 0s at 9-15 \u2192 replaced, but the output shows more 3s. So this theory doesn't explain that.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is to replace all consecutive 0s starting from the first occurrence of seven 0s. So for example, if there's a run of 8 0s starting at index 8, replace all 8 with 3s. If there's a run of 20 zeros starting at index 9, replace all 20 with 3s.\n\nThis seems to fit the training examples:\n\nExample 0's row 5: seven zeros \u2192 replaced.\n\nExample 0's row 10: run of 22 zeros \u2192 replaced all.\n\nExample 1's row 0: run of seven zeros \u2192 replaced.\n\nExample 2's row 0: run of eight zeros \u2192 replaced all eight with 3s.\n\nExample 0's row 21: run of 17 zeros \u2192 replaced all 17. Wait, but the output has 16 3s followed by 0. How?\n\nInput row 21 of Example 0:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nOutput:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nSo the input has 17 zeros starting at index 0. The output replaces 16 zeros with 3s, then has a 0 at index 16. Why is that?\n\nIf the rule is to replace all consecutive zeros starting from the first occurrence of seven, then the entire run of 17 should be replaced. But here, only 16 are replaced. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut maybe there's a different rule. Perhaps the replacement starts at the first occurrence of seven zeros, but only replaces the first seven of them. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's row 21 input has 17 zeros. The first seven are at indices 0-6. So replace those with 3s. Then the remaining zeros are left. But the output shows indices 0-15 as 3s (16 elements). So this theory is incorrect.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's look for other patterns.\n\nAnother observation: In all training examples, the replaced elements are always in the middle part of the array. Perhaps the replacement is done after a certain number of elements. For example, after the first 8 elements. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's row 5: replacement starts at index 9.\n\nExample 1's row 0: replacement starts at index 6.\n\nExample 2's row 0: replacement starts at index 8.\n\nNo clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement starts at the first 0 after the eighth element. For example, in Example 0's row 5, the first 0 after index 8 is at index 9.\n\nIn Example 1's row 0: the first 0 after index 8 is at index 6. But index 6 is before 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The replacement starts at the ninth element (index 8) and replaces the next seven elements. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's row 5: index 8 is 0. Then replace indices 8-14. But in the output, replacement starts at 9.\n\nNo. Doesn't fit.\n\nPerhaps the replacement is based on a different trigger. Let's think of the 3s as a substitution for zeros in a specific window. For example, from index 9 to 15 (inclusive). So regardless of the values in those positions, replace them with 3s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's row 5, indices 9-15 are 0s. Replaced with 3s.\n\nRow 6: same.\n\nRow 7: same.\n\nRow 8: same.\n\nRow 9: same.\n\nRow 10: indices 9-15 replaced, but the output has 3s beyond. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nBut how to explain row 10's output. If the rule is to replace indices 9-15 with 3s, but the output has 3s beyond. That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is to replace from index 9 to the end of the array, but only if all elements from index 9 are zeros. But in Example 0's row 5, after index 15, there is a 0 at 16 which is not replaced.\n\nThis is not working. I need to find a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: In all training examples, the replacement with 3s occurs in the same positions where there were zeros in the input. So the 3s are replacing zeros. So perhaps the rule is to replace a specific block of zeros with 3s. But how to determine which block.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, the replaced blocks are always the first occurrence of seven consecutive zeros. Once found, those seven zeros are replaced with 3s. If there are more zeros after that, they remain unchanged. Let's verify:\n\nExample 0's row 5: seven zeros at 9-15 replaced.\n\nExample 0's row 10: seven zeros at 9-15 replaced. The input has more zeros beyond, but in the output, those are also replaced. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, no. In row 10's input, after index 15, there are zeros. But the output shows that those are replaced with 3s. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Let's try to look for another angle. The only commonality I can see is that the replacement is a sequence of 3s starting at a certain index, and the length varies. The only way this could make sense is if the replacement is to replace the first run of seven consecutive zeros with 3s, regardless of their position, and if the run is longer than seven, replace the entire run. \n\nBut in Example 0's row 21, the input has 17 consecutive zeros starting at 0. The output replaces 16 of them with 3s. Which doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is to replace the first seven zeros, not necessarily consecutive, starting from a certain index. But this is unlikely.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the 3s are inserted starting from the 10th element (index 9) for a certain number of elements. In the training examples, it's seven elements. But in Example 0's row 10, it's more. So perhaps the number of 3s is determined by the input. For example, the number of zeros from index 9 onwards. If there are at least seven zeros, replace them all with 3s. Otherwise, replace as many as possible.\n\nBut in row 5 of Example 0, there are seven zeros from index 9. Replaced.\n\nRow 10: 22 zeros from index 9. Replaced all.\n\nExample 1's first row: seven zeros from index 6. Replaced.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: in each array, find the first occurrence of a sequence of seven consecutive zeros. Replace all consecutive zeros in that sequence (including any beyond seven) with 3s. \n\nBut in Example 0's row 21, the first sequence of seven zeros starts at index 0. Replace all consecutive zeros (17) with 3s. But the output only has 16 3s. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the examples. But assuming the training examples are correct, there must be a pattern.\n\nLet me look at Example 0's row 21 again:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nOutput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nSo the first 16 elements are 3s. The input has 17 zeros. So the replacement stops at index 15. Why?\n\nMaybe the replacement is to replace the first 16 zeros. But why 16?\n\nThis is perplexing. I'm running out of ideas. Perhaps the pattern is that the replacement starts at the first occurrence of a 0 and continues until the next non-zero, but only if there are at least seven zeros. \n\nFor example, in Example 0's row 5, the zeros from 9-15 (seven) are replaced.\n\nIn row 10, the zeros start at 9 and go to the end, so replaced all.\n\nIn row 21, the zeros start at 0 and go to 16 (element 16 is 0), but there's a non-zero at 17 (8). So replace from 0 to 16. But why 16? Because 17 elements, but 16 replaced.\n\nI can't see a pattern here.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding the exact pattern, I'll proceed with the assumption that the replacement is to replace the first occurrence of seven consecutive zeros with 3s. If there are more than seven zeros in the run, replace all of them. So, for example, in a run of eight zeros, replace all eight with 3s.\n\nBased on this, for the test input:\n\nLooking at the first test input array:\n\n[0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLooking for a run of seven zeros. The run from index 8 to 13 (indices 8-13 inclusive) has six zeros. Index 14 is 4. So no seven zeros. Thus, no replacement. The output would be the same as input.\n\nAnother test input array:\n\n[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4]\n\nHere, indices 8-14 (0-based) are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Seven zeros. So replaced with 3s. So the output would have 3s from indices 8-14.\n\nAnother test array:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis has a run of 30 zeros. So replaced with 30 3s.\n\nBut according to the examples, like Example 0's row 10, the entire run is replaced.\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input:\n\nFor each array in the test input, find the first occurrence of seven consecutive zeros. Replace all consecutive zeros in that run with 3s. If no such run exists, leave as is.\n\nSo, in the test input, for each array, we need to check for any run of seven or more consecutive zeros. If found, replace all in that run with 3s. Otherwise, no change.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given test input arrays.\n\nFirst test array:\n\n[0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLooking for runs of seven zeros. The longest run of zeros is from index 8 to 13 (six zeros). So no replacement. Output is same as input.\n\nSecond test array:\n\n[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4]\n\nZeros from index 8 to 14 (inclusive) are seven. So replaced with 3s from 8-14.\n\nThird test array:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4]\n\nLooking for seven zeros. The run from index 4-7 is four zeros. Other runs: index 10-13 (four zeros). So no seven. No replacement.\n\nFourth test array:\n\n[4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4]\n\nRun of zeros from index 1-3 (three zeros). Then index 8:4. Index 9-12: four zeros. Index 19-24: six zeros. So no seven. No replacement.\n\nFifth test array:\n\n[4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0]\n\nRun from index 10-16: seven zeros (indices 10-16). So replace them with 3s.\n\nSixth test array:\n\n[0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLooking for seven zeros. Run from index 19-23: five zeros. Other runs: indices 10-13 (four). So no replacement.\n\nSeventh test array:\n\n[4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4]\n\nRun of zeros from index 4-5 (two), 8-9 (two), 10-13 (four), etc. No seven.\n\nEighth test array:\n\n[0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nRun from index 9-15: seven zeros. Replace with 3s.\n\nAnd so on for the rest.\n\nSo, the final answer would be to replace the first occurrence of seven consecutive zeros with 3s, covering the entire run of zeros (even if longer than seven). For each array in the test input, we check for such a run and replace it.\n\nThe test input has several arrays where this occurs. For each of those, the output will have 3s replacing the run. For others, no change.\n\nThe response should be the test input arrays with the appropriate replacements.",
