        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of three rows, each containing numbers. The output is another set of three rows, but transformed in some way. Let's start by comparing the inputs and outputs for each example to see what's happening.\n\nStarting with Example 0:\n\nInput rows:\n[0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]\n[0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n[0,2,1,1,0,0,0]\n[2,2,0,1,2,2,2]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nHmm. Let's look for changes. The output rows are shorter than the input. Maybe some elements are being combined or summed? Let's check the first input row. The input starts with 0,5, followed by a bunch of zeros. The output starts with 0,2,1,1, etc. Not sure. Let's see if adjacent elements are being added or something.\n\nWait, maybe it's about collapsing sequences. Like, when there's a 5 followed by certain numbers. Let me check. For example, in the first input row, the 5 is followed by zeros. The output for that row has a 2 and 1s. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe each 5 in the input affects the next elements. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input rows have 5s and 1, and the output rows have some 2s and 3s. Let's take the third input row of Example 1: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0]. The output is [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]. So here, the 5s might be turning into 2s, and the numbers after them into 1s? Like, a 5 in the input becomes a 2, and the next elements (maybe up to a certain point) become 1s. Then the 3s in the input might stay as 3s? Not sure.\n\nWait, the first 5 in the input's third row (position 1) becomes 2 in the output. Then the next elements (originally 0,0,0,0,0) become 1,1,1. Then there's another 5 at position 7 in the input, which becomes 3,3 in the output? But in the output, after that 5 (input) becomes 3,3. Hmm, maybe the 5s are acting as markers that influence the next elements, depending on their value. Or perhaps it's about the positions between 5s.\n\nAnother angle: maybe each 5 in a row indicates the start of a new segment, and the numbers between 5s are summed or transformed in a certain way. Let's look at Example 0's first input row: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So between the initial 0 and the 5, maybe the 5 is replaced by 2, and the following zeros are turned into 1s for a certain length. But how many 1s? The output here has two 1s after the 2.\n\nWait, maybe the 5 is replaced by 2, and the next two elements (the first two zeros after the 5) become 1s each. Then the rest are zeros. Let's check. The input row is length 9, output is length 7. So maybe the transformation reduces the length by two. Alternatively, each 5 creates a 2 and then the following elements are 1s up to a certain point.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's second input row, there's a 5 at index 3 and another at 6. The output row is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. The 5s in the input become 1 and 2? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe each 5 in a row is replaced by 2, and the next elements (until the next non-zero number) are replaced by 1s. But in the first input row of Example 0, after the 5, all are zeros. So maybe the 5 becomes 2, and the next two elements become 1s. Then the rest are truncated or turned to 0. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput row: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nSo starting from the 5 (position 1), replace 5 with 2. Then the next two zeros become 1,1. Then the rest (four zeros) become 0,0,0. Wait, but the original input after 5 has 8 elements (since the row is length 9), but the output after 2 is 1,1 followed by three 0s. Hmm. Maybe the length is adjusted by collapsing segments between 5s. Alternatively, perhaps the output is formed by replacing each 5 with 2 and each 1 with 0, and then merging adjacent similar numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers between 5s are being summed, but that doesn't seem to fit. For instance, in Example 0's second input row: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. The output is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. The 5 is followed by 1, then 0 and 5. The output has 1 where the 5 was, and then 2s. Maybe the 5 is replaced by 1, and the next elements until another 5 are modified. But in this case, after the first 5 (input index 3), the output becomes 1, then the next 5 (input index 6) becomes 2,2,2. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input:\n\nInput row 0: [0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\nOutput row 0: [0,1,1,2,2,0,2,2]\n\nSo the 5 is in position 2. The output after 1 (from input 1) is followed by 1, then 2,2. The 5 in the input seems to turn into 1 here. Wait, but maybe when a 5 is encountered, the next elements are transformed in a certain way. Alternatively, perhaps each 5 acts as a marker to split the row into segments, and each segment is processed by taking the sum or some other operation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are acting as a signal to change the value of subsequent elements. For instance, each time a 5 appears, the following elements (until the next 5) are converted to 1s, and the 5 itself is converted to 2. Let's check Example 0's first input row again:\n\nOriginal: 0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 output starts with 0,2,1,1,0... So after the 5 (converted to 2), the next two zeros become 1,1. Then the rest are zeros. So perhaps the number of 1s after a 5 depends on the number of elements until the next 5 or the end.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input first row, after the 5, there are seven zeros. The output has two 1s. So maybe it's a fixed number of elements after each 5. Alternatively, perhaps the number of 1s is the number of zeros following the 5 up to the next non-zero element. But in this case, all are zeros, so maybe the number is fixed as two.\n\nAlternatively, each 5 in the input row is replaced by a 2, and the next two elements (regardless of their value) are replaced by 1s, then the rest are truncated. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's first input row:\n\nOriginal length is 9. Output is 7. So each 5 reduces the length by 2. So maybe for each 5, the row is transformed by replacing 5 with 2 and the next two elements with 1s. So in the input, after the 5 (index 1), the next two elements (indices 2 and 3) are 0 and 0. These become 1 and 1. The rest (indices 4-8) are all 0, which would be 5 elements. But the output after the 1,1 is 0,0,0. So that's three elements. So maybe the remaining elements after processing the 5 are truncated or merged.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by processing each 5 and its subsequent elements. Let's try applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\nRow 1: [2,2,0,0,1,0,5,3,0,0,8]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLet's try processing row 0 according to the hypothesis that each 5 becomes a 2, followed by two 1s, and the subsequent elements are handled similarly. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row 0: 0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8\n\nProcessing each 5:\n\n- The first 5 (position 1) becomes 2, followed by two 1s (positions 2 and 3). But then position 3 is another 5. So perhaps overlapping processing? Or processing each 5 in sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps each 5 is replaced by 2, and the next two elements are replaced by 1s. If another 5 is encountered within those two elements, it would overwrite. Let's step through:\n\nOriginal: 0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8\n\nProcessing first 5 at index 1:\n\n- Replace 5 with 2. Next two elements (indices 2 and 3) become 1,1. So the row becomes:\n\n0,2,1,1,1,0,0,5,0,5,8\n\nWait, but index 3 was a 5. But according to this processing, it's being replaced by 1. Then, the next elements after that would be from index 4 onwards. But then there's a 1 at index 4, which is not a 5. Hmm, maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 5 is replaced by 2, and then the next two elements (even if they are 5s) are turned into 1s. Let's try:\n\nOriginal row 0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nProcessing first 5 (position 1):\n\nReplace with 2. Then next two elements (0 and 5) become 1 and 1. So now up to position 4:\n\n[0,2,1,1,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nBut now, the next element is index 4 (1). Then next 5 is at position 3 (originally 5, now replaced by 1?), which complicates things. Maybe the processing is done in passes, but that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each occurrence of 5 is replaced by 2, and the following two elements are set to 1, regardless of their original values. Then, the entire row is collapsed by removing any elements after those 1s until the next 5 or the end. But this seems unclear.\n\nLooking back at the outputs, in Example 0's first output row, after the initial 0,2,1,1, there are three zeros. The input had after the 5 (position 1) six zeros (positions 2-7). But the output after 1,1 has three zeros. So maybe each 5 and the next two elements are turned into 2,1,1, and then the rest of the elements are taken as-is but starting from position 4 in the original. But then the output length would be original length - 2. For example, original length 9 becomes 7. So 9 - 2*number_of_5s? Let's check. In Example 0's first input row, there's one 5. 9-2=7, which matches the output length.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 0: [0,0,0,5,1,5,0,0,0,0,0]. There are two 5s. Original length 11. 11-2*2=7, but the output length is 9. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So that theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output rows are shorter because certain elements are being merged. Let's look for another pattern. For example, the output might be the sum of consecutive elements between 5s, but I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input:\n\nRow 1 input: [2,2,2,0,5,8,8,0,0,0,0]\nOutput: [2,2,2,0,0,8,6,6,6]\n\nHmm. The 5 in the input is followed by 8,8. The output has 8, then 6,6,6. Wait, maybe when a 5 is followed by a number, that number is added to the 5's position. But not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 5 and the next elements are transformed in some way. For example, 5 followed by 8,8 becomes 0,8,6,6,6. So maybe the 5 is replaced by 0, and then the 8s are turned into 6s? But why 6?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 5 in a row causes the next elements to be decremented by 2. For instance, 8 becomes 6. But in Example 2, the input row 1 has 8,8 after the 5, which become 6,6,6. Wait, the output is 8, then three 6s. So maybe after a 5, the next element is kept, but the following elements are decremented. Or maybe the 5 is replaced by 0, and then the next elements are modified.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 5 as a marker that splits the row into sections, and each section is processed by some rule. For example, sections between 5s are summed, or the maximum is taken, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother observation: in the output rows, sometimes numbers like 2, 1, 3 appear where there were 5s in the input. For instance, in Example 1's third input row, the two 5s become 2 and 3 in the output. Wait, in Example 1's third output row, the first 5 in the input becomes 2, and the second 5 becomes 3? So maybe each 5 is replaced by a number that depends on its position or the surrounding elements.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s are replaced by 2, then the following elements are replaced by 1s until another 5 is encountered. But that doesn't explain all cases.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input row 0: [0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\n\nOutput row 0: [0,1,1,2,2,0,2,2]\n\nHere, the 5 is followed by a bunch of zeros and then 2s. The output after 1 (from input 1) becomes 1, then 2,2. So maybe the 5 is replaced by 1, and the following zeros are turned into 2s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each time a 5 is found, the next non-zero element is added to the current processing. For example, in Example 0's first input row, after the 5, there are all zeros, so maybe nothing is added. In the output, after the 2 (from 5), there are 1,1. Maybe the 2 is followed by two 1s as a default.\n\nAnother approach: look for the differences between input and output rows. For example, in Example 0's second input row:\n\nInput: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]\n\nOutput: [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]\n\nHere, the 5 at index 3 becomes 1, and the next 5 at index 6 becomes 2, with the following elements turning into 2s. So perhaps the first 5 is replaced by 1 and the next 5 by 2, and surrounding elements are altered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are replaced by the sum of the next two elements. For example, in Example 0's second input row, the first 5 is followed by 1 and 0. Sum is 1, so replace 5 with 1. The next 5 is followed by 2 and 2. Sum is 4, but output has 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps each 5 is replaced by the number of non-zero elements immediately following it. In Example 0's first input row, after the 5, there are seven zeros. So non-zero count is 0. But the output has 2 followed by 1s. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the 5 is replaced by the number of elements until the next 5 or end. For example, in Example 0's first input row, the next 5 is nowhere, so the count is 7. But output is 2. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find another pattern. Looking at the lengths of the input and output rows:\n\nExample 0:\nInput rows: 9,9,9 \u2192 Output rows: 7,7,7. So each row is shorter by 2.\nExample 1:\nInput lengths: 11,11,11 \u2192 Output lengths:9,9,9. So each row is shorter by 2.\nExample 2:\nInput lengths: 11,11,11 \u2192 Output lengths:9,9,9. So again, each row is shorter by 2.\nExample 3:\nInput lengths: 11,11,11 \u2192 Output lengths:8,8,8. Wait, that's a reduction of 3. Hmm. But previous examples have reduction of 2. Maybe the number of 5s in the row affects the output length. Let's check:\n\nExample 0 input row 0 has one 5. Output length is 7 (9-2=7). So maybe each 5 reduces the length by 2. But in Example 3's input row 0 has one 5. Original length 11, output 8. 11-3=8. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output length is the input length minus the number of 5s multiplied by 2. Example 0's first row: one 5 \u2192 9 - 2*1=7. Example 1's first row has two 5s \u2192 11 - 2*2=7. But the output length is 9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the length change isn't the key. Let's look at the positions of the 5s and their corresponding output changes.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by sliding a window over the input and applying some operation. For example, a window of size 3, where if the middle element is 5, then transform it and the surrounding elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are generated by iterating through the input row, and whenever a 5 is encountered, replace it with a 2 and the next two elements with 1s. Then, the rest of the elements are taken as-is, except when another 5 is encountered. Let's test this on Example 0's first input row:\n\nInput: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nProcessing:\n\nStart at index 0: 0, then 5. Replace 5 with 2. Next two elements (0 and 0) become 1 and 1. Now, the processed part is [0,2,1,1]. The remaining elements are from index 4 onwards: 0,0,0,0,0. These are taken as-is? But the output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0], which has 7 elements. The original had 9 elements. So after processing the 5 and next two, we take the remaining elements but truncate to fit. So perhaps after processing each 5 and two next elements, the remaining elements are taken but the total length is reduced by two for each 5.\n\nLet's check Example 1's third input row:\n\nInput: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0]\n\nOutput: [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]\n\nSo according to the hypothesis, each 5 is replaced by 2, next two elements become 1s. Let's process:\n\nOriginal: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0]\n\nFirst 5 at index 1: replace with 2. Next two elements (0 and 0) become 1 and 1. So now we have [0,2,1,1]. The remaining elements from index 3 onwards are 0,0,0,5,3,0,0. Wait, but we already processed up to index 3 (original index 3 was 0, which became 1). Then the next elements are index 4:0, index5:0, index6:0, index7:5, etc.\n\nWait, maybe after processing the first 5 (index 1), the next two elements (indices 2 and 3) are processed. Then we continue processing from index4. So the next elements are 0,0,0,5,3,0,0.\n\nThe output after the first 5 would be [0,2,1,1], then the next elements are 0,0,0,5,3,0,0. Now, there's another 5 at index7. Replace it with 2, next two elements (3 and 0) become 1 and 1. So the processed part becomes [0,2,1,1,0,0,0,2,1,1,0]. But the output is [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]. Hmm, this doesn't match. So maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after each 5, the next two elements are set to 1, regardless of their values. So in Example 1's third input row, after the first 5 (index1), the next two elements (indices2 and 3) become 1,1. Then, the following elements (indices4,5,6) are 0,0,0. Then the next 5 at index7 is replaced by 2, and the next two elements (3 and 0) become 1,1. So the output would be [0,2,1,1,0,0,0,2,1,1,0]. But the actual output is [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]. Hmm, not matching. So this approach may not be correct.\n\nLet's look at Example 2's input:\n\nRow 2 input: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,6,6]\n\nOutput row: [0,0,2,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nHmm. The input has 5 at indices2 and 8. The output starts with 0,0,2, then 8,8,8. So the first 5 becomes 2, and the next elements are 8s. But the input after the 5 at index2 is 0,0,0,0,0,5,6,6. The output after 2 has 8,8,8. How does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are replaced by 2, and then the next elements are transformed based on other rules. For example, the numbers after the 5 are added or something. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother angle: look at the output numbers and see if they relate to neighboring input numbers. For instance, in Example 0's second input row:\n\nInput: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]\n\nOutput: [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]\n\nThe 5s are replaced by 1 and 2. The first 5 is followed by 1, which in output is replaced by 1. The next 5 is followed by 2, which in output becomes 2. Maybe the value after the 5 becomes the replacement for the 5. So 5 followed by 1 \u2192 replace 5 with 1. 5 followed by 2 \u2192 replace 5 with 2. But what if the next element is zero? Let's check Example 0's first input row: 5 is followed by zeros. Output has 2. So that hypothesis doesn't hold. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is replaced by the sum of the next two elements. For Example 0's second input row, the first 5 is followed by 1 and 0. Sum is 1. So replaced by 1. The next 5 is followed by 2 and 2. Sum is 4, but the output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 5 is replaced by the sum of all elements until the next 5 or end. Example 0's first input row's 5 is followed by seven zeros. Sum is 0 \u2192 replaced by 2. No, that doesn't explain.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's think differently. Maybe the output is a transformed version of the input where each 5 is replaced by 2, and each number after a 5 until the next 5 or end is replaced by 1. For example:\n\nIn Example 0's first input row: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 0,2 followed by 1s for the next six elements. But the output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So only two 1s. So maybe it's limited to two 1s after each 5.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each 5 in the input, we replace it with 2, and the next two elements with 1s. Any remaining elements after that are kept as-is, but if another 5 is encountered, repeat the process.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample 0's first input row:\n\n[0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 0,2,1,1, then the remaining elements (0,0,0,0,0) become 0,0,0 (truncated to the original length - 2, so 9-2=7 elements). So output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. That fits.\n\nExample 0's second input row:\n\n[2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]\n\nFirst 5 at index3 \u2192 replace with 2? Or 1? Wait, output is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. So first 5 is replaced by 1, next two elements (1,0) become 2,2? No. Wait, perhaps the 5 is replaced by the value of the next element. So 5 followed by 1 becomes 1, then the next element is 0. So replace 5 with 1, then next two elements (1 and 0) become something. But the output here has 1 followed by 2,2.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's try applying the initial hypothesis to the test input.\n\nTest input row0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nAccording to the hypothesis where each 5 is replaced by 2 and next two elements by 1:\n\nProcessing each 5:\n\n- First 5 at index1 \u2192 replace with 2. Next two elements (0 and5) become 1,1. So we have [0,2,1,1].\n- Next 5 is at index3 (original input) but after processing first 5, the next elements were indexes2 and3 (0 and5), which are now 1 and1. So the next 5 in the input is at index3 (original), but after replacement, it's part of the 1s. So maybe we process the input in sequence, not overlapping. So the next 5 is at original index3. Let's process it:\n\nReplace with 2. Next two elements (1 and0) become 1,1. Now, we have [0,2,1,2,1,1].\n- Next 5 is at original index7. Replace with 2. Next two elements (0 and5) become 1,1. So we have [0,2,1,2,1,1,2,1,1].\n- Next 5 is at original index9. Replace with 2. Next two elements (8 and end) become 1,1. So adding those: [0,2,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,1]. But the original length is 11, output length should be 11 - 4*2=3? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the output length is original length minus 2 per 5. Test input row0 has four 5s. 11 - 2*4=3. But the output should have three elements. But looking at the training examples, the output rows vary in length. So this approach may not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row is formed by processing each 5 and the next two elements, replacing them with 2,1,1, and then the rest of the elements are appended. But overlapping would occur if 5s are close. Let's try the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nProcessing each 5 and next two:\n\nFirst 5 at index1: replace with 2, then 0 and5 \u2192 1,1. Now the row becomes [0,2,1,1,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]. But wait, the next 5 is at index3 (original input), which is now part of the processed segment (index3 was 5 in the original, but after replacement, it's 1). So maybe we process the input as a list, and once a 5 is processed, we skip the next two elements.\n\nAlternatively, process each 5 in order, stepping through the input:\n\nStart at index0: 0, then index1 is 5. Replace with 2. Take next two elements (indices2 and3) as 1,1. Now processed up to index4. The remaining input is indices4-10: 1,0,0,5,0,5,8.\n\nNext, check if any 5s are in the remaining input. At index4: 1, then index7 (original index7 is 5). So process index7: replace 5 with 2, take next two elements (indices8 and9) as 1,1. Now the row is [0,2,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,1,8]. Remaining elements: 8 (index10). The output is now length 11, which isn't shorter. But the training examples show shorter outputs. Hmm.\n\nThis approach isn't matching the training examples. Maybe another pattern is needed.\n\nLooking back at Example 1's third output row:\n\nInput: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0]\n\nOutput: [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]\n\nHere, the first 5 is replaced by 2, followed by three 1s. The second 5 is replaced by 3, followed by two 3s. How does that happen?\n\nMaybe the number of 1s after a 5 depends on the distance to the next 5. In the input, the first 5 is at index1, the next 5 is at index7. The distance is 6 elements. So maybe the number of 1s is the number of elements between the 5 and the next 5, divided by something. But 6 elements between them. Output has three 1s. Hmm. 6/2=3. Maybe that's it.\n\nSo for each 5 in the input, replace it with 2, then the next 'n' elements (where n is half the distance to the next 5) are replaced with 1s. If there is no next 5, then 'n' is the remaining elements.\n\nFor Example 0's first input row, the 5 is at index1, and there's no next 5. So the distance is 8 elements (from index1 to end). Half of 8 is 4, but the output has two 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 1s is the number of elements between the 5 and the next 5. In Example 1's third input row, between the two 5s (indices1 and7) there are 5 elements (indices2-6: 0,0,0,0,0). So five elements. Output has three 1s. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to think of the output as merging every three elements into one in some way. For example, each group of three elements is summed or averaged. But looking at Example 0's first input row:\n\n[0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nIf we group into three: [0,5,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]. Sum each group: 5, 0, 0. But the output starts with 0,2,1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum of each trio. 5,0,0. Still doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking elements from the input and modifying them based on their position relative to a 5. For instance, every element after a 5 is reduced by 1. But in Example 0's first input row, after the 5, all are zeros. Output after 2 is 1,1,0,0,0. So maybe each zero after 5 becomes 1 for the first two, then 0.\n\nBut then, in Example 1's third input row, after the first 5, there are five zeros, and the output has three 1s. So maybe the first three zeros after a 5 become 1s. But in Example 0's first output, after 5, two 1s. So inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, every time a 5 appears, the next two elements are set to 1. So for each 5, you write 2 followed by two 1s. Then the rest of the elements are appended as-is. But if another 5 is within those two elements, you handle it in sequence.\n\nLet's try this approach for the test input row0:\n\nInput: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst 5 at index1: replace with 2, next two (indices2 and3) become 1,1. Now, the processed part is [0,2,1,1].\n\nThe remaining elements are indices4-10:1,0,0,5,0,5,8.\n\nNext, look for 5s in the remaining elements. The next 5 is at index7 (original index7), which is now at position3 in the remaining elements (since we've processed up to index3). So in the remaining elements, the first element is 1 (index4), then 0,0,5 (index7), etc.\n\nReplace the 5 at index7 (original) with 2, next two elements (indices8 and9) become 1,1. Now, the processed part becomes [0,2,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,1].\n\nThe remaining elements after this are index10:8.\n\nSo the full output would be [0,2,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,1,8], but this is length 11, which doesn't match the training examples where outputs are shorter.\n\nBut according to Example 0's first row, after processing a 5, the output length is reduced by 2. So each 5 reduces the row length by 2. The test input row0 has four 5s, so original length 11 - 4*2 = 3. But the output would need to be 3 elements, which isn't likely. But in Example 1's first input row, which has two 5s, the output is length9 (original 11-2*2=7, but no). So this approach isn't correct.\n\nAnother observation: looking at Example 3's input row1:\n\nInput: [1,1,0,0,5,2,0,5,2,0,0]\n\nOutput: [1,1,0,0,2,2,2,0]\n\nHere, the 5 at index4 is replaced by 2, and the next elements (2,0,5) are turned into 2,2,2. Then the next 5 at index7 is replaced by 0? Or maybe the processing is different. \n\nAlternatively, each 5 is replaced by the value of the next non-zero element. For example, the first 5 in row1 of Example3 is followed by 2. So 5 becomes 2. The next 5 is followed by 2, so becomes 2. But in the output, after the first 5 is replaced by 2, the next elements are 2,2,2. So maybe the 5 is replaced by the next non-zero element, and that element's value is used to fill the next few positions.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe the pattern is that each 5 is replaced by the number of non-zero elements to its left in the same row, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the 5s are being replaced by the sum of the previous elements. \n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the result of applying a cellular automaton-like rule where each cell is updated based on its neighbors and certain conditions. For example, if a cell is 5, it becomes 2, and the next two cells become 1s.\n\nBut given the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I think the most consistent pattern across examples is that each 5 is replaced by 2, the next two elements are replaced by 1s, and any subsequent elements are retained but the row is truncated to the original length minus 2 for each 5. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nTest row0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nThere are four 5s. Each 5 reduces the length by 2, so 11 - 4*2 = 3. But that's too short. But looking at the training examples, the output lengths vary even with the same number of 5s, so maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by collapsing each 5 and the following two elements into three elements: 2,1,1. So for each 5, three elements are replaced by three new elements. So the total length remains the same. But that doesn't explain the shortening.\n\nWait, in Example 0's first input row, which has one 5, the output is 7 elements. The input is 9. 9 - 2 =7. So for each 5, the row is shortened by 2. So each 5 reduces the length by 2.\n\nIf the test input row0 has four 5s, the output length would be 11 - 2*4=3. But the training examples show that Example1, which has two 5s in the first row, output length is9 (11-2*2=7, but output length is9, so that's not possible.\n\nThis suggests that the length reduction isn't based on the number of 5s. \n\nAnother possibility is that the output length is the input length minus two, regardless of the number of 5s. For Example0's first row:9-2=7. Example1's first row:11-2=9. Example2's first row:11-2=9. Example3's first row:11-2=9. Wait, no. Example3's output row0 is length8. Original length11. 11-3=8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let's try to see if the output rows are formed by merging every two consecutive elements into one, summing them or something. For example, input length9 becomes7 by merging every two elements after the first. But Example0's first row input is [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Merging elements 0-1:0+5=5, then 0+0=0, 0+0=0, 0+0=0, 0+0=0. That doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the input and replacing each 5 with 2, then the next two elements with 1s, and then removing the two elements after each 5. For example, in Example0's first row:\n\nOriginal: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nReplace 5 with 2, then remove the next two elements (0,0). So the row becomes [0,2] followed by the remaining elements after those two: [0,0,0,0,0]. But the output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0], which is longer than this. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, when a 5 is encountered, insert 2,1,1 in its place, and remove the next two elements. So for each 5, three elements are added, but two are removed. Net gain of one element. But this would increase the length, which doesn't happen.\n\nThis is really tough. Given that I'm stuck, I'll try to hypothesize that each 5 is replaced by 2, and the next two elements are replaced by 1s. Then, the rest of the elements are left as-is, but the row is truncated to a certain length. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nProcessing each 5:\n\n- First 5 at index1: replace with 2, next two elements (0 and5) become 1,1. Now we have [0,2,1,1,1,0,0,5,0,5,8].\n- Next 5 is at index4 (original index3) in the new list? No, original input's next 5 is at index3. After processing the first 5, the elements after are 0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8. So the next 5 is at index3 (original index3). Replace it with 2, next two elements (1,0) become 1,1. Now the list is [0,2,1,1,2,1,1,0,5,0,5,8].\n- Next 5 is at index8 (original index7). Replace with 2, next two elements (0,5) become 1,1. Now list is [0,2,1,1,2,1,1,0,2,1,1,8].\n- Next 5 is at index10 (original index9). Replace with 2, next two elements (8) become 1,1 (assuming we pad with zeros if necessary). Now list is [0,2,1,1,2,1,1,0,2,1,1,2,1,1,8]. But this is longer than the original. \n\nThis doesn't match the training examples. So perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the competition setting, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the patterns I can observe.\n\nLooking at the test input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,1,0,5,3,0,0,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nFollowing the pattern from the examples, perhaps each 5 is replaced by 2, and the next two elements are 1s. Any subsequent elements are left as-is, but the row is shortened by two elements for each 5. \n\nFor row0, four 5s. Original length11. 11 -4*2=3. But that's too short. Alternatively, each 5 reduces the row by 2 elements. So output length would be 11 - 2*4=3. But examples don't support this. For example, Example1's first row has two 5s, output length9. 11-2*2=7, but output is9. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output length is the input length minus the number of 5s. For row0:11-4=7. Let's see:\n\nRow0 input has four 5s. Output length7. Let's process:\n\nReplace each 5 with 2, then remove one element after each 5. So for each 5, two elements (5 and next) are replaced by 2. That reduces length by 1 per 5. 11-4=7.\n\nBut not sure. Let's try:\n\nRow0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nReplace each 5 with 2 and remove the next element:\n\n- First 5 at index1: replace with 2, remove index2 (0). Result: [0,2,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n- Next 5 at index2: replace with 2, remove index3 (1). Result: [0,2,2,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n- Next 5 at index5: replace with2, remove index6 (0). Result: [0,2,2,0,0,2,5,8]\n- Next 5 at index6: replace with2, remove index7 (8). Result: [0,2,2,0,0,2,2]\n\nThis gives a length of7, which matches the hypothesis. The output row0 would be [0,2,2,0,0,2,2]. Does this fit any pattern from the examples?\n\nLooking at Example0's first output row: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. This doesn't fit the same pattern, as the processing here replaces 5 with 2 and removes next element, but in Example0's case, after the 5, two 0s are turned into 1s. So this approach might not be correct.\n\nAnother idea: each 5 and the following element are replaced by 2 and 1. So for each 5, two elements are replaced by 2 and 1. For example:\n\nRow0:\n\n0,5,0 \u2192 0,2,1\n\nThen 5,1 \u2192 2,1\n\nThen 5,0 \u2192 2,1\n\nThen 5,8 \u2192 2,1\n\nResulting in [0,2,1,2,1,0,0,2,1,2,1]. But length is11, not shorter. Not matching examples.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll make a guess based on the observation that in each output row, the number of 2s corresponds to the number of 5s in the input row. For instance, in Example0's first row, one 5 \u2192 two 2s. Example1's third row has two 5s \u2192 one 2 and two 3s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows have a 2 followed by 1s for each 5 in the input. For the test input row0, which has four 5s, the output might be [0,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,1]. But this is longer than the input. Not matching.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I think the best approach is to look for the output in the test input by trying to mimic the examples' transformation. For example, in the test input row0, there are multiple 5s. Perhaps each 5 is replaced by 2, the next elements are turned into 1s for a certain number, and the other elements are modified based on other rules.\n\nAfter struggling, I'll tentatively propose the following output based on the examples' patterns:\n\nFor each 5 in a row:\n\n- Replace the 5 with 2.\n- The next two elements are replaced with 1s.\n- Any elements after that are kept as-is, but the row is truncated to the original length minus 2 per 5.\n\nTest input row0 has four 5s. Original length11. 11 - 2*4=3. So output length3. But examples don't support this. \n\nAlternatively, the output row length is original length minus 2, regardless of the number of 5s. So for test input row0, length11 \u21929. Let's try:\n\nProcessing row0:\n\n[0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8] \u2192 replace each 5 with 2 and next two elements with 1s, then truncate to 9 elements.\n\nFirst 5: replace with 2, next two \u21921,1. Now [0,2,1,1,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8] \u2192 no, this isn't working.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess. Looking at Example1's output where a 5 is followed by a 1 and another 5, the output has 2, then 1s, then 3s. Maybe the numbers after 5 are replaced by their values minus something. \n\nAlternatively, the output might be the result of replacing each 5 with 2, and each number after a 5 (until the next 5) with 1. For example:\n\nTest row0:\n\n[0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nReplace each 5 with 2, and everything after until next 5 or end with 1.\n\nFirst 5 \u2192 2, then until next 5: 0,5 \u2192 but there's a 5 soon. So from first 5 at index1 to next 5 at index3, the elements are 0. Replace with 1,1. Then next 5 at index3 \u2192 2, then until next 5 (index7):1,0,0 \u2192 replace with 1,1,1. Then next 5 \u21922, until next 5 (index9):0 \u21921. Then 5 at index9 \u21922, until end:8 \u21921.\n\nSo output row0: [0,2,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,1]. But length is 10. Doesn't match training examples.\n\nGiven that I can't find a clear pattern, I'll look for the most consistent transformation across the examples and apply it to the test input. For example, in Example0's first row, the output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. The input has a 5 followed by zeros. The output starts with 0,2,1,1, then zeros. So perhaps each 5 is replaced by 2, next two elements by 1s, and the rest are zeros.\n\nApplying this to test row0:\n\nEach 5 is replaced by 2, next two elements by 1s. For four 5s:\n\n[0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8] \u2192 \n\nFirst 5 \u21922, next two (0,5) \u21921,1 \u2192 [0,2,1,1,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nSecond 5 \u21922 (at position3 of new list), next two (1,0) \u21921,1 \u2192 [0,2,1,2,1,1,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nThird 5 \u21922 (position7), next two (0,5) \u21921,1 \u2192 [0,2,1,2,1,1,0,2,1,1,8]\n\nFourth 5 \u21922 (position9 of new list), next two (1,8) \u21921,1 \u2192 [0,2,1,2,1,1,0,2,1,2,1,1]\n\nBut the output length is now 12, which is longer than the input. This doesn't match the training examples where outputs are shorter.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to make a guess based on the closest patterns I can find. For the test input:\n\nTest rows:\n\nRow0: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nRow1: [2,2,0,0,1,0,5,3,0,0,8]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nPossible output based on replacing each 5 with 2 and next two elements with 1s, and truncating the row:\n\nRow0 becomes [0,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,1] (length10). But examples show shorter outputs. Alternatively, after processing all 5s, truncate to original length minus 2 per 5. 11-8=3. Not sure.\n\nAnother guess:\n\nRow0 output: [0,2,1,2,1,0,2,1,0,2,8] \u2192 not sure.\n\nBut looking at Example3's output, which has multiple replacements, perhaps the output is formed by replacing each 5 with 2 and the next non-zero elements with 1s, then merging.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed to provide an output based on the closest pattern I can derive, even if uncertain.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these input and output lists. Each input is a list of three rows, and the output is also three rows but shorter. Let's look at the examples to see what's happening.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input rows have lengths 9, 9, 9, and the outputs are 7, 7, 7. So maybe each row is being shortened by two elements? Let me check the numbers.\n\nLooking at the first input row in Example 0: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Hmm, how does that happen? The original starts with 0,5, then a bunch of zeros. The output starts with 0,2,1,1. Not obvious.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation involves combining elements from the three rows. Because each output row might be derived from the three input rows. Let's check each position.\n\nTake the first output row in Example 0. Let's see the first elements from each input row:\n\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 2\nRow 3: 0\n\nThe output's first element is 0. So maybe adding them? 0+2+0=2, but the output is 0. Not that. Or maybe taking the maximum? Max(0,2,0) is 2, but output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at adjacent elements. For example, the output rows are shorter, so perhaps combining two elements from each input row into one in the output. Let's see: original length 9 becomes 7. So each output row is 2 elements shorter. How? Maybe combining pairs of elements and applying some operation.\n\nWait, in Example 0's first input row: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. The output is length 7. So maybe each output element is the sum or some combination of two input elements. But 9 input elements can't directly map to 7 output elements unless overlapping. Like a sliding window of two elements, stepping by one. For example, 0+5=5, 5+0=5, etc. But the output numbers here don't match that. Alternatively, maybe subtracting adjacent elements. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input row 0: 0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Let's take each pair and subtract the first from the second. So 5-0=5, 0-5=-5, 0-0=0, etc. But the output starts with 0,2,1,1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are derived from the input rows by some kind of collapse where non-zero elements are influencing neighboring positions. Let's look at the outputs in the examples. For instance, in Example 0's output first row: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. The second input row in the example is [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. The output's first row might be combining elements from the input rows. Maybe when a 5 is in the input, it affects the output in some way. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input rows:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,5,1,5,0,0,0,0,0] (length 11)\nRow2: [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3]\nRow3: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0]\n\nOutput rows are lengths 9,9,9. Let's look at the third output row: [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]. Hmm, maybe when there's a 5 in the input, it's converted to something. For example, in the third input row of Example 1, there are 5s at positions 1 and 7. The output third row has 2,1,1,1,3, etc. Maybe the 5s are acting as markers for certain operations.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps each output row is generated by taking the input rows and collapsing sequences of zeros, but that doesn't explain the numbers. Alternatively, maybe each position in the output is a combination of the three input rows' elements. For example, for each column in the input, some operation is done across the three rows to produce the output. But the output rows are shorter, so maybe overlapping columns.\n\nWait, the input has three rows of the same length. The output also has three rows, each of which is shorter by two elements. So maybe the output rows are formed by processing the input in some way that reduces the length by two. For example, merging the first two elements into one, then the next two, etc., but that would reduce the length by half if merged pairwise. Alternatively, maybe the output is the sum of each three consecutive elements? Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row: 0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. If we sum every three elements, we get (0+5+0)=5, (0+0+0)=0, (0+0+0)=0. But the output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0], which doesn't match. So that's probably not it.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is generated by looking at each position in the input and the positions to the left and right, applying a certain rule. For instance, for each element in the input row (excluding the first and last), sum the left and right elements and replace. But the output rows are shorter, not the same length.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the original rows and collapsing certain sequences. For example, in Example 0's output first row, the 2 and 1s might correspond to some pattern from the input rows. Let's check the first input row: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. The second input row is [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. So the 0 in the first output row's first position might come from the first input row's 0, but the 2 in the second position could be from the second input row's 2. Maybe the output is a combination of the three input rows, but shifted. For example, for each position i in the output, it's a combination of input rows' i+1 and i-1 positions. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is a result of some operation that involves adjacent elements in the input rows. For example, in the first output row of Example 0, the elements 0,2,1,1, etc. Looking at the input rows:\n\nAt position 1 (input row 1 has 5, input row 2 has 2, input row 3 has 0. The output row 1's second element is 2. Maybe taking the value from the second row when the first row has a 5. Because in Example 0, the first input row's second element is 5, and the second input row's first element is 2. So maybe when there's a 5 in a row, the output takes the value from the row below or above. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's third output row: [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]. The input third row has 5s at positions 1 and 7. The output has 2 followed by 1s. Maybe 5s in the input are replaced with a sequence of 1s, but how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output rows and see how they might relate to the input rows. For instance, in Example 0:\n\nOutput row 1: [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. This looks similar to the input's second row [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. Maybe the output row is the input's second row with some modifications. For example, the 5s in the input's second row become 1s in the output. The 5 at position 3 becomes 0, but in the output it's 0. Hmm. Or perhaps when a 5 is present in any of the input rows, it affects the output in some way.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input rows:\n\nFirst row: 0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\nSecond row: 2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2\nThird row: 0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n\nThe output rows are:\n\n[0,2,1,1,0,0,0]\n[2,2,0,1,2,2,2]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking at the second output row, which is similar to the second input row but with 5s replaced. For example, the input has 5 at positions 3 and 6. In the output, those positions become 1 and 2. Hmm, not sure. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput third row: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0]\nOutput third row: [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]\n\nHere, the 5s are at positions 1 and 7. In the output, after the first 0, there's a 2, then three 1s, then 3s. Maybe when a 5 is in a row, it's replaced by a sequence of 1s in the output, but how does the 2 come into play? Or maybe when a 5 is present in a row, the output takes values from the row below.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by collapsing the input rows where 5s act as separators or markers. For example, the regions between 5s are summed or counted. But how?\n\nAnother idea: The output rows might be the result of a convolution or some kind of sliding window that checks for the presence of 5s and modifies the values accordingly. For example, when a 5 is found in the input, it creates a certain pattern in the output.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input:\n\nThird row: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,6,6]\nOutput third row: [0,0,2,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nThe 5 in position 2 and 8. In the output, after the 5, there's a 2 followed by 8s. Maybe the 5 triggers taking the next elements from another row. Let's check the input rows. The third row's 5 is at position 2. The output has 2 here. The second input row at position 2 is 0. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a 5 is present in a row, the output for that position is the sum of the values from the other two rows. For instance, in Example 0's first row, position 1 is 5. The other two rows at that position are 2 (second row) and 0 (third row). 2+0=2, which is the second element in the first output row. Then, looking at the next elements, maybe the 5 in the first row affects subsequent positions. For example, in Example 0's first output row, after the initial 0, we have 2,1,1. Maybe the 5 in the first row's position 1 leads to taking values from the second row, and then decrementing. For example, the 2 is from the second row's position 0 (but the output's position 1). Not sure.\n\nWait, let's take Example 0's first output row [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. The first element is 0. The first input rows' first elements are 0, 2, 0. Maybe the output is taking the sum of the three input rows at each position, but that would be 0+2+0=2 for the first position. But the output is 0. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are the sum of the three input rows, but only in certain positions. For example, the output rows are two shorter, so maybe the sum is taken from the middle elements. But not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's output, the third row is all zeros. The third input row has a 5 in the middle. So how does that lead to zeros? Maybe if all elements in a column are zero except for a 5, it becomes zero in the output. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's third output row: [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]. The input third row has 5s at positions 1 and 7. The output starts with 0, then 2. Maybe the 5 in position 1 triggers taking the value from the second input row's position. Let's see: input row 2 at position 1 is 2 (since input row 2 is [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3], but the output row is third row's output. Wait, maybe each output row corresponds to a different input row. For example, output row 1 is processed from input row 2, output row 2 from input row 3, and output row 3 from input row 1. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is generated by processing the three input rows in a certain way. For instance, output row 1 is the sum of input rows 1 and 2, but again, not matching.\n\nLet me think of another angle. Maybe the numbers in the output are derived from the count of non-zero elements in the input rows. For example, in Example 0's output first row: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. The first input row has 0,5,0,... So the first element is 0, but the second input row has 2,2, etc. Maybe the output counts the number of non-zero elements in the three input rows for each position. But then the first output element would be 0 (since input rows 1,2,3 have 0,2,0: sum of non-zero is 1. But the output is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the elements from the three input rows, but with some transformation. For example, if any of the elements is 5, then some operation is done. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, input first row's second element is 5. The output's second element is 2. The second input row's first element is 2, third row's first is 0. Maybe when there's a 5 in a row, the output takes the value from the row below. For instance, in input row 1, position 1 has 5. Then, the output row 1's position 1 is 2 (from input row 2, position 0). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a 5 appears in any of the three input rows at a position, the output for that position (or nearby) is modified. For example, in Example 0's input, the first row has a 5 at position 1, the second row has 5s at positions 3 and 6, and the third row at position 4. The output's first row has 2 at position 1, 1 at 2 and 3. Maybe each 5 in the input causes the output to take values from adjacent positions in other rows.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to look for a different pattern. Perhaps the output rows are formed by replacing each 5 in the input with a certain number of 1s, and then merging adjacent numbers. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row has a 5. The output first row has 2, then two 1s. Maybe when a 5 is present, it's replaced by the sum of the adjacent elements from other rows. For example, input row 1's 5 is at position 1. The elements from row 2 and 3 at position 1 are 2 and 0. 2+0=2. Then maybe the next positions are decremented. So 2 becomes 1, then 1 again. So the 5 in row 1 causes 2,1,1 in the output. Let's check Example 1's third input row which has two 5s. The output third row starts with 0,2,1,1,1,3,3. The first 5 is at position 1. The row 2's position 1 is 2 (input row 2 is [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3]). So 2 from row 2's position 1. Then 1s follow. So perhaps each 5 is replaced by the value from the row below (row 2's position 1) and then 1s for the following positions. Then the next 5 in row 3's position 7 would take row 2's position 7, which is 0 (input row 2's position 7 is 0), but in the output third row, after the 1s, there's 3,3. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, when a 5 is encountered in a row, the output starts a sequence of numbers starting from the value from the row below, then decrements by 1 each step until 1. For example, in Example 0, the 5 in row 1, position 1 leads to taking row 2's value (2) and then 1,1. So 2,1,1. But why three elements? The output first row has those three elements starting at position 1. The input row 1 has a 5 followed by zeros, so maybe the 5 affects the next two positions as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5 acts as a marker to start a sequence where the next elements in the output are filled with the number from the row below, then each subsequent position decreases by 1 until it reaches 1. For example:\n\nIn Example 0, row1's 5 at position1 leads to:\n\nTake row2's position1 (2) \u2192 output position1 is 2.\n\nThen, output positions2 and 3 are 1 and 1 (decrementing).\n\nSimilarly, in Example1's third input row, the 5 at position1 leads to taking row2's position1 (2) \u2192 output position1 is 2, then 1,1,1.\n\nThen, the next 5 in position7 would take row2's position7, which is 0 (since input row2's position7 is 0 in Example1?), but looking at the output third row of Example1, after the three 1s, there's 3,3. So maybe not.\n\nWait, Example1's third input row has a 5 at position7. Input row2's position7 is 0. But the output third row's elements after the 1s are 3,3. Hmm, maybe it's taking from row3's next elements. Not sure.\n\nThis seems a bit too inconsistent. Let's look at another example. Example3's input:\n\nRow1: [0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\n\nOutput row1: [0,1,1,2,2,0,2,2]\n\nThe input row1 has a 5 at position2. Let's see the output. The output starts with 0,1, then 1. The row2's input is [1,1,0,0,5,2,0,5,2,0,0]. So maybe when there's a 5 in row1, position2, the output takes row2's position2 (which is 0) \u2192 but the output here is 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by a combination of the three input rows, but with each 5 acting as a trigger to take values from the row below. For example, if row1 has a 5 at position i, then the output row1's position i is taken from row2's position i-1 or i+1. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let's check the lengths. Each input row's length is 9, 11, 11, etc. The output rows are 7,9,9, etc. Wait, in Example0, input rows are 9 elements each, output 7. Example1: input 11, output 9. Example2: input 11, output 9. Example3: input 11, output 8. So the output length is input length minus 2 for Example0 and Example3, minus 2 for Example1 and 2. Wait, no. Example3's input rows are 11 elements and output is 8. 11-3=8. Hmm, not a consistent pattern. So maybe the output is formed by removing the first and last elements of the input row. But Example0's input row of 9 becomes output of 7. 9-2=7, which would require removing one element from each end. Let's check:\n\nExample0's input first row: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. If we remove first and last, we get [5,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. Doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are created by taking the input rows and merging every two elements into one. For example, 9 elements become 4 or 5. But in Example0, the output is 7 elements. 9 elements can't be split into 7 by merging two. Maybe overlapping pairs. For example, 9 elements can produce 8 pairs, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking the input rows and replacing certain elements. For example, whenever a 5 is found in the input, it's replaced with 1s or some sequence. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0's first input row, there's a 5. The output first row has a 2 followed by 1s. So maybe when a 5 is found in row1, the output for that position is taken from row2's previous position. In Example0, row1's 5 is at position1. Row2's position0 is 2, which becomes the output's position1. Then, the next positions are 1s. So 2, then 1, 1. That fits. Then, the next 5 in row2's position3 (value5) would be replaced by row3's position2 (0), but output row2's position3 is 1. Hmm, not sure.\n\nBut this could be part of the pattern: whenever a 5 appears in any row, the output for that position is the sum of the previous row's elements or something. Let me test this.\n\nIn Example0's row2 has a 5 at position3. The output row2's position3 is 1. The previous row (row1) position3 is 0. The next row (row3) position3 is 0. Summing those gives 0. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe taking the value from the row below. So row2's 5 is replaced by row3's value, which is 0. But output row2's position3 is 1, which doesn't match. So this isn't working.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by collapsing the input rows such that whenever there's a 5, it triggers a countdown from the value of the previous row's element. For example, in Example0's row1 has 5. The previous row (row2) at position0 is 2. So the countdown starts at 2, then 1,1. That would explain the output's [0,2,1,1,...]. But why 0 in the first position?\n\nAlternatively, when a 5 is present in any row at position i, the output for that column is the sum of the other two rows at i-1 and i+1. But this is too vague.\n\nLet me think of the outputs as being derived from the input rows with 5s acting as markers to spread some values. For example, in Example0's output first row: the 5 in the first input row's position1 causes the output to have 2,1,1. Maybe the 2 is taken from row2's position0, then decremented by 1 for the next two positions. So 2,1,1. Then, the output row is formed by replacing the 5 and adjacent zeros with these values. So the input [0,5,0,0,...] becomes [0,2,1,1,0,...]. This would require that a 5 in any input row is replaced by a sequence of numbers taken from adjacent rows, possibly the row below or above.\n\nIn Example1's third input row has a 5 at position1. The output third row starts with 0,2,1,1,1. The 2 might come from row2's position0 (which is 2). Then decrementing each step. So 2,1,1,1. Then the next 5 in position7 would take row2's position6, which is 0. So the output would have 0, then 3s from somewhere else. But how?\n\nThis pattern seems possible. So the rule could be:\n\nWhenever a 5 is present in any input row, look at the previous row (or the row above or below) to get a starting value, then fill the output with that value decremented by 1 for the next few positions. The number of positions filled might depend on how many zeros follow the 5.\n\nFor example, in Example0's first input row: 5 is followed by several zeros. So the output starts at the 5's position with the value from row2's previous position (row2's position0 is 2), then the next two positions are 1 and 1. Then, the output continues with zeros.\n\nBut how to determine how many positions to fill. For Example0's first input row, the 5 is followed by six zeros, but the output has 2,1,1. So three positions. Maybe the count is the number of zeros after the 5, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the count is fixed as three: start at the 5's position, and fill three positions with the value from row below's previous position, then decremented.\n\nThis is getting a bit more concrete. Let's test this hypothesis with Example1's third input row:\n\nInput row3: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0]\n\nThe output third row is [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]. The first 5 is at position1. The row above (row2) at position0 is 2. So output positions1,2,3,4 would be 2,1,1,1. But the output starts with 0 in position0, then 2 in position1. So maybe the 5's position in the input is output position1, and the next three positions are filled with 2,1,1,1. But in the output, it's 2,1,1,1. That's four positions. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the count is three: starting from the position after the 5, fill three positions. For Example0's first row, 5 is at position1. So output positions1,2,3: 2,1,1. Which matches.\n\nIn Example1's third input row, the first 5 is at position1. So output positions1,2,3,4: 2,1,1,1. But in the output, positions1-4 are 2,1,1,1. That's four positions. But according to the hypothesis, maybe three. This is conflicting.\n\nAnother example: Example2's third input row has 5s at positions2 and8. The output third row is [0,0,2,8,8,8,0,0,0]. The first 5 is at position2. The row above (row2) at position1 is 2 (input row2: [2,2,2,0,5,8,8,0,0,0,0]). So output position2 becomes 2, then positions3,4,5: 8,8,8. The 8s might be from the row below's elements. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 in the input row triggers taking the maximum value from the adjacent rows. For Example0's first 5 in row1: adjacent rows (row2 and row3) have values 2 and 0. The max is 2, which is the output's next value.\n\nBut in Example2's third input row, the 5 at position2: adjacent rows (row2 and row1) have values row2's position2 is 2, row1's position2 is 0. Max is 2, which matches the output's position2.\n\nThe next 5 in row3's position8: adjacent rows (row2's position8 is 0, row1's position8 is 0). Max is 0, but the output here is 0,0,0. But the output third row in Example2 has 8s after position2. Wait, maybe the 5 in row3's position8 is followed by 6,6. But how does that relate to the output?\n\nThis is getting really complex. Let me try to find a different pattern. Maybe the output is formed by collapsing the input rows such that each output row is the sum of the three input rows' elements, but with some adjustment when a 5 is present. For example, whenever a 5 is in any of the three input rows, that position in the output is replaced with a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are the result of a process where each 5 in the input rows \"activates\" a spread of values from the row below. For example, when a 5 is found in row i, it copies the value from row i+1 at that position, then decrements by 1 for each subsequent position until it hits 1. But how does this work across the examples?\n\nIn Example0's first input row has a 5 in row1, position1. The row below is row2, which has 2 at position1. So output row1's position1 becomes 2, then decrements by 1 for the next two positions: 1,1. That would explain the output [0,2,1,1,0,0,0].\n\nSimilarly, in Example1's third input row has a 5 in row3, position1. The row below would be row1 (since there are only three rows), but row1's position1 is 0. So output row3's position1 would be 0, but according to the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the row above instead. Row2's position1 is 2. So the output for row3's position1 would take row2's position1, which is 2. Then decrements for the next positions: 1,1,1. Which matches the output's [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0]. Then, the next 5 in row3's position7: row2's position7 is 0. So output position7 would be 0, but the output has 3,3. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Unless it's taking from another row.\n\nThis seems plausible for some parts but not others. Let's try applying this pattern to the Test Input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow1: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\nRow2: [2,2,0,0,1,0,5,3,0,0,8]\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nProcessing each 5 in the input rows:\n\nRow1 has 5s at positions1,3,7,9.\n\nFor each 5 in row1:\n\n- Position1: Look at row2's position1, which is 2. Output row1's position1 becomes 2. Then next two positions (2 and3) become 1 and 1. But the next 5 is at position3, which might override this.\n\nWait, the Test Input's row1 has 5s at positions1,3,7,9. Let's process each:\n\nAt position1 (row1): take row2's position1=2. So output row1's position1 is 2, next two positions (2 and3) are 1 and 1. But position3 is another 5. So when processing that, maybe the first 5's spread is interrupted by the next 5.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the rule is: for each 5 in any row, the output for that position is the value from the row below (row2) at the same position, and the next two positions are filled with 1 each.\n\nBut in Example0's first row's 5 at position1: row2's position1 is 2. Output is 2, then 1,1. That fits.\n\nExample1's third row's 5 at position1: row2's position1 is 2. Output third row's position1 is 2, then 1,1,1. Maybe for each 5, the next three positions are filled with decremented values. But how to determine how many steps.\n\nAlternatively, each 5 in the input causes three positions in the output: the original position and the next two. The value is taken from the row below's position, then decrement by 1 each step. So:\n\nFor a 5 in row i, position j:\n\noutput[i][j] = row_below[j]\noutput[i][j+1] = row_below[j] -1\noutput[i][j+2] = row_below[j] -2\n\nBut if row_below[j] is less than 2, then stop when it reaches 0.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample0's row1 has 5 at j=1. row_below is row2[j=1] = 2.\n\nSo output row1[j=1]=2, j+1=2 \u2192 1, j+2=3 \u21920. But in Example0's output row1, j=3 is 1. So this doesn't fit. Wait, but the output for row1 is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So at j=3, it's 1. So perhaps the decrement stops at 1.\n\nAnother possibility: for each 5 in the input, the output for the same position is the value from the row below, and the next two positions are 1s. For example:\n\n5 in row1, position1: output row1's position1=2 (row2's position1=2), positions2 and3=1,1.\n\nThis matches Example0's output row1.\n\nExample1's third row has a 5 at position1: row2's position1=2. So output row3's position1=2, positions2,3,4=1,1,1. Which matches the output [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0].\n\nThen, the next 5 in row3's position7: row2's position7=0. So output row3's position7=0, positions8,9= -1 (but that can't be). Since output can't have negative numbers, maybe it's capped at 0. But in the example's output, after the 3,3,0,0, it's different. Maybe this approach only works for certain cases.\n\nLet's try applying this to the Test Input.\n\nTest Input row1 has 5s at positions1,3,7,9.\n\nFor row1's 5 at position1:\n\n- row2's position1 is 2. So output row1's position1 is 2, positions2 and3 are 1,1.\n\nBut row1's position3 is also a 5. So for position3:\n\n- row2's position3 is 0. So output row1's position3 is 0, positions4 and5 are 0-1=-1 (but capped to 0 or 1?).\n\nBut since outputs don't have negative numbers, maybe they become 0. So positions4 and5 are 0.\n\nThen, position7 has 5:\n\n- row2's position7 is3. So output row1's position7 is3, positions8 and9 are 2,1.\n\nPosition9's 5: row2's position9 is0. So output row1's position9 is0, positions10 and11 (but the output is shorter, so perhaps this is truncated).\n\nBut the output rows are shorter than the input. So each 5 in the input adds three positions to the output? No, because in Example0, the input has 9 elements and output 7. So maybe the output is formed by replacing each 5 with three elements (2,1,1), which reduces the length. Wait, no. If each 5 is replaced by three elements, the output would be longer. But the output is shorter. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, when a 5 is processed, it and the next two elements are condensed into three elements. For example, for each 5 in the input, three elements in the input are processed into three in the output. But this might not fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll try to form the output based on the pattern that for each 5 in any row, the output takes the value from the row below at the same position and fills the next two positions with 1s. So, in the Test Input:\n\nRow1 has 5s at positions1,3,7,9.\n\nFor each 5:\n\n- position1: row2's position1=2 \u2192 output row1's positions1-3 become 2,1,1.\n- position3: row2's position3=0 \u2192 output row1's positions3-5 become 0,0,0 (since 0-1=-1, which may be capped to 0 or 1. But in Example0, the 0 in row2's position3 led to output row2's position3=1. So maybe the minimum is 0, but in Example0, row2's position3 is 5. So maybe when the row below's value is 5, it's replaced with 1. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too unclear. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the Test Input's rows:\n\nRow1: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\nRow2: [2,2,0,0,1,0,5,3,0,0,8]\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nAssuming that each 5 in a row causes the output to take values from the row below, and then fill with 1s. For example:\n\nRow1's 5 at position1: take row2's position1=2 \u2192 output starts with 0,2,1,1. But then the next 5 at position3 in row1 would take row2's position3=0 \u2192 output adds 0,1,1. Then, the 1 in row1's position4 is 1. Then, 5 at position7 in row1 takes row2's position7=3 \u2192 output adds 3,2,1. 5 at position9 takes row2's position9=0 \u2192 adds 0,0,0. But this would make the output longer than the input. So perhaps overlapping or overwriting.\n\nAlternatively, considering the output rows are shorter by two elements than the input, maybe each 5 and the next element are merged into one. For example, each 5 is replaced by a certain value, and the next element is dropped. But this is just a guess.\n\nAfter struggling, I think the pattern is that each 5 in a row is replaced by a sequence starting with the value from the row below at that position, followed by decrementing 1 until 1. Then, the output is formed by combining these sequences and the non-5 elements, which are left as is. Additionally, the output rows are shorter by two elements because each 5 and its surrounding elements are condensed.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\nRow1 has 5s at 1,3,7,9.\n\nFor each 5 in row1:\n\n- Position1: row2's position1 is 2 \u2192 output becomes 2,1,1 (replacing 5 and two zeros). So input [0,5,0, ...] becomes [0,2,1, ...].\n- Position3: row2's position3 is0 \u2192 0,0,0. So input [5,1,0] becomes 0,0,0. But this may overwrite the existing elements.\n- Position7: row2's position7 is3 \u21923,2,1.\n- Position9: row2's position9 is8 \u21928,7,6. But output rows are shorter, so maybe only three elements per 5.\n\nBut the output length for the test input is input length minus 2 (11 elements \u21929). So for row1, processing each 5 and merging two elements into three. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to generate the output based on the assumption that each 5 in a row is replaced by the value from the row below and the next two positions are filled with 1s. For the Test Input:\n\nRow1's output:\n\nOriginal row1: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8]\n\nProcessing 5s:\n\n- At index1: row2[1]=2 \u2192 output becomes 0,2,1,1.\n- Next 5 at index3: row2[3]=0 \u2192 insert 0,1,1. But the current output would be [0,2,1,1, 0,1,1].\n- Then 1 from input is kept.\n- Next 5 at index7: row2[7]=3 \u2192 insert 3,2,1.\n- 0 from input, then 5 at index9: row2[9]=0 \u2192 insert 0,0,0.\n- Finally, 8 from input.\n\nBut this would make the output longer. To fit the shorter length, perhaps the 8 is dropped. Alternatively, the output is formed by processing each 5 and replacing it with two elements (row_below's value and 1). But this is uncertain.\n\nGiven the examples, especially Example1's third output row, which has [0,2,1,1,1,3,3,0,0], where 5s in input row3 are replaced by sequences from row2's values. So for each 5 in row3, take row2's value and fill with decrementing 1s for three positions.\n\nIn Test Input's row3: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 5 is at position4. row2's position4 is1. So output for row3 would have 1, then 0,0,0 (decrementing). But the output row3's length should be 9 (11-2=9). So perhaps the output for row3 would be [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut this doesn't match the examples. Hmm.\n\nAfter much analysis, the closest pattern I can find is that each 5 in a row triggers taking the value from the row below and then filling the next few positions with 1s. The exact number of positions filled and how they're handled may vary, but based on the examples, here's my best guess for the Test Input's output:\n\nRow1: 0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8\n\nProcessing each 5:\n\n- position1: row2[1]=2 \u2192 2,1,1\n- position3: row2[3]=0 \u21920,0,0 (since 0-1 can't go below 0)\n- position7: row2[7]=3 \u21923,2,1\n- position9: row2[9]=0 \u21920,0,0\n\nSo the output row1 would be:\n\n[0,2,1, 0,0,0, 1,3,2, 0,0,0,8]\n\nBut this is longer than the input. Since the output rows are shorter by two elements, maybe overlapping or merging occurs. This is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll look for another approach. The output rows seem to have certain numbers that are from the input rows but transformed. For example, in Example0's output row2: [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. The input row2 has [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2]. The 5s are replaced by 1 and 2. Perhaps each 5 in a row is replaced by the value from the row below at that position. So for row2's 5 at position3, row3's position3 is0 \u2192 0. But output row2's position3 is1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, when a 5 is present in a row, the output for that position is the sum of the other two rows at that position.\n\nIn Example0's row1, position1: 5. Other rows at position1 are 2 (row2) and0 (row3). Sum is 2+0=2. Output row1's position1 is2.\n\nRow2's position3:5. Other rows at position3:0 (row1) and0 (row3). Sum 0+0=0. Output row2's position3 is1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output rows are the sum of the corresponding elements from the other two rows. For row1's output, sum of row2 and row3. Example0's row1 output: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. row2: [2,2,0,5,1,0,5,2,2], row3: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]. Sum of row2 and row3:\n\n[2+0=2, 2+0=2, 0+0=0,5+0=5,1+5=6,0+0=0,5+0=5,2+0=2,2+0=2]. This doesn't match the output.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll make a final guess based on the examples that the output is formed by collapsing the input rows such that each 5 in a row is replaced by the value from the row below at that position, and the next two positions are filled with 1s. The output row is then trimmed to two elements shorter than the input.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n\nRow1: [0,5,0,5,1,0,0,5,0,5,8] \u2192 output starts with 0, then for each 5:\n\n- 5 at position1 \u2192 row2[1]=2 \u2192 2,1,1. Then 5 at position3 \u2192 row2[3]=0 \u21920,0,0. Then 5 at position7 \u2192 row2[7]=3 \u21923,2,1. 5 at position9 \u2192 row2[9]=0 \u21920,0,0. The rest elements are 1,0,0,8.\n\nPutting this together with overlaps and truncating to 9 elements:\n\n[0,2,1,0,0,0,3,2,1]\n\nBut this is just a guess. The other rows would follow similar logic.\n\nRow2's input: [2,2,0,0,1,0,5,3,0,0,8]\n\nRow2's 5 at position6. So take row3's position6=0 \u21920, then 1,1. Other elements stay.\n\nRow3's input: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3's 5 at position4. Take row1's position4=1 \u21921,0,0.\n\nBut this is speculative. Based on the examples, I'll proceed to format the answer as per the training examples.",
