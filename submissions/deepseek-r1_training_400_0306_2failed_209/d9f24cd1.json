        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nFirst, let's look at Example 0. The input has a 5 in the 4th row, 7th column (indexing from 0 maybe?), another 5 in the 6th row, 3rd column, and the last row has 2s in positions 1,4,6. The output for Example 0 has a lot of 2s added in the second column. Wait, looking at the output rows, each row starts with 0, then 2, then some positions. But the original input's last row has 2s, so maybe the 2s in the output are related to propagating those upwards?\n\nWait, maybe the 2s in the bottom row are the source, and they spread upwards, but there's something with the 5s. Let me compare the input and output for example 0. The input has 5s at [3][6] and [5][2]. The output has 2s added in various positions. Let me check the output rows. For example, in the output, rows 0 to 2 all have a 2 in position 1, 4, 7? Wait the first output row is [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0]. So positions 1,4,7 have 2s. Similarly in the next rows. But where do these 2s come from? The input's last row is [0,2,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0]. So in the input's last row, positions 1,4,6 have 2s. But the output's first few rows have 2s in 1,4,7. So maybe each 2 in the original bottom row creates a vertical line upwards, but shifted somehow?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s act as obstacles or markers, and the 2s are moving upwards but when they hit a 5, they shift? Let's look at Example 0's input. The 5s are at (3,6) and (5,2). In the output, the rows above the 5s might have 2s shifted. For instance, in the output row 3 (input row 3), the 5 is at position 6, and the output has 2s in 1,4,7. So maybe the original 2s in the bottom row are moving up, and when they pass a 5, they shift to the right? Or maybe the 5s are causing the 2s to split or change direction.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: the 5s are at (3,5), (5,1), (6,8). The output's bottom row is [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0]. In the output, the 2s are in positions 1,4,7 again. But in the input's last row, the 2s are at 1,4,6. Wait, in the input's last row, position 6 is a 2, but in the output's last row, position 6 is 0 and 7 is 2. Hmm, that's confusing. Or maybe the 2s in the output are in positions 1,4,7 for the upper rows, but the bottom row's 2s are transformed. Wait in example 1's input, the last row is [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0], which in the output remains the same. But in example 0's input, the last row was [0,2,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0], and in the output, it's changed to [0,2,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0]. Wait no, the output's last row is same as input's last row for example 0. Wait no, in example 0's input, the last row's 2s are at 1,4,6. The output's last row is the same. But the other rows in the output have 2s at 1,4,7. So maybe the 2s from the bottom are moving up, but when they hit a 5, they shift right? Let me check.\n\nIn example 0's input, the 5 in row 3, column 6. In the output, row 3 has a 5 in column 6 and 2s in 1,4,7. So the original 2s from the bottom (columns 1,4,6) when moving up, perhaps when they reach a row with a 5 in their column, they move right by one? For instance, the 2 in column 6 (from the bottom row) would go up each row. When it hits row 3, which has a 5 in column 6, then the 2 would shift to column 7 in the rows above that. So the 2s in the upper rows are at 1,4,7, but in the bottom row, they were at 1,4,6. The 5 in row 3, column 6 caused the 2 from column 6 to shift to 7 in the rows above.\n\nSimilarly, in example 1's input, the 5 is in row 3, column 5. The output's upper rows have 2s at positions 2,4,7. Wait, the input's bottom row has 2s in columns 1,4,7. Wait the output's upper rows in example 1 have 2s in columns 2,4,7? Let me check. The output for example 1's first row is [0,0,2,0,2,0,0,2,0,0]. So columns 2,4,7. So the bottom row's 2s are at 1,4,7, but upper rows have 2s at 2,4,7. How did that happen? Maybe each 5 in a certain column causes a shift. Let's see: in example 1, the input's 5s are at (3,5), (5,1), (6,8). The output rows above the 5 in row 3, column 5 have 2s shifted. Let's see: the bottom row's 2s are at 1,4,7. When moving up, the 2 in column 1 (from bottom row) would move up. But there's a 5 in row 5, column 1. So when the 2 from column 1 goes up past row 5, maybe it shifts to column 2. Similarly, the 2 in column 7 would not be shifted unless there's a 5 in column 7. But in example 1's input, the 5 in row 6, column 8. So when the 2 in column 7 moves up, when it reaches row 6 with a 5 in column 8, which is next to it. But how does that affect it?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to model the pattern.\n\nHypothesis: The 2s in the bottom row propagate upwards. For each 2 in the bottom row's column, the 2 moves up each row until it hits a 5. When a 2 in column c moving up encounters a 5 in the same column (c) in a row above, the 2 shifts to column c+1 (right) for the rows above that 5.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n1. Start with the bottom row's 2s. For each 2 in the bottom row, track its column.\n2. Move up each row. For each row, if there's a 5 in column c, then any 2 that would be in column c from below would shift to c+1 in the rows above that 5.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0.\n\nInput Example 0's bottom row is row 9 (0-based?), columns 1,4,6 have 2s.\n\nFor the 2 in column 1: as it moves up, there are no 5s in column 1. So it stays in column 1 for all rows. Hence, in the output, all rows have 2 in column 1.\n\nFor the 2 in column 4: moving up. Are there any 5s in column 4? Let's check input. The 5s are in row 3, column 6 and row 5, column 2. So no 5s in column 4. So the 2 in column 4 stays in column 4 as it moves up. So all output rows have 2 in column 4.\n\nFor the 2 in column 6: moving up. The input has a 5 in row 3, column 6. So when the 2 in column 6 moves up to row 3, it encounters the 5. Therefore, in the rows above row 3 (rows 0,1,2), the 2 shifts to column 7. So in the output, rows 0-2 have 2 in column 7, and rows 3 and below have 2 in column 6 until the 5 is hit.\n\nWait, in the output of example 0:\n\nRow 3 has a 5 in column 6. The 2 in column 6 would be present in rows below row 3 (rows 4-9). But row 3's output is [0,2,0,0,2,0,5,2,0,0]. So in row 3, column 7 is also 2. How does that fit?\n\nHmm, maybe when a 2 moving up hits a 5 in the same column, then in the same row as the 5, the 2 is shifted to the right. Wait that might not fit. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: for each column c in the bottom row where there's a 2, we create a vertical line of 2s going up. However, if there's a 5 in column c in a higher row, then the vertical line shifts to column c+1 starting from that row upwards.\n\nFor example, in Example 0:\n\n- The bottom row's 2s are at columns 1,4,6.\n- For column 1: no 5s in any rows above. So vertical line remains at 1.\n- Column 4: no 5s. So vertical line at 4.\n- Column 6: there's a 5 in row 3, column 6. So from row 3 upwards, the 2s shift to column 7. So rows 0-2 have 2 in column 7, row 3 has 5 in 6 and 2 in 7, rows 4-8 have 2 in 6 (since below the 5 in row 3), but wait no, row 5 has a 5 in column 2. Wait that's another 5. How does that affect things.\n\nWait, maybe each 5 in a column affects only the 2s that are passing through that column. So the 5 in column 2 in row 5 (example 0's input) would affect any 2s moving up through column 2. But in example 0's bottom row, the 2s are in columns 1,4,6. So the 5 in column 2 doesn't interfere with those. So maybe only the 5 in column 6 (row 3) affects the 2 from column 6, causing it to shift right to column 7 from row 3 upwards.\n\nIn the output for example 0's row 5, which has a 5 in column 2, there's a 2 in column 2 (from the input), but the output row 5 is [0,2,5,0,2,0,2,0,0,0]. So the 5 is present, and there's a 2 in column 2. But according to the hypothesis, maybe the 5 in column 2 is not in the path of any 2s from the bottom (since the bottom 2s are in columns 1,4,6). So that 5 in column 2 doesn't affect the 2s' vertical lines. So the 5 in column 2 is just present, but the vertical lines are from 1,4,6. So the 2 in column 6 moves up until row 3, hits a 5, shifts to 7. Then rows 0-2 have 2 in 7, rows 3 and below have 2 in 6 (but row 3 has 5 in 6, so maybe in row 3, the 2 is shifted to 7 and the 5 is left as is).\n\nWait looking at example 0's output row 3: [0,2,0,0,2,0,5,2,0,0]. So column 6 is 5 (from input), and column 7 is 2. So the 2 in column 6 from the bottom row hits the 5 in row 3, so in row 3, the 2 is shifted to 7, and the 5 remains. Then, in rows above row 3 (rows 0-2), the 2 is in column 7. Rows below row 3 (rows 4-8) would have the 2 in column 6 again? Because the 5 is only in row 3. But in the output, rows 4-8 have 2 in column 6? Let's check example 0's output:\n\nRow 4: [0,2,0,0,2,0,2,2,0,0]. Wait, columns 6 and 7 are 2 and 2. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the shift is only above the 5. So in row 3, the 2 is shifted to 7, and all rows above have 7. Rows below (rows 4-9) have 6? But row 4's output has 2 in 6 and 7. How does that fit?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me check the second example.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the bottom row's 2s are in columns 1,4,7. The output's upper rows have 2s in columns 2,4,7. So the 2 from column 1 must have shifted to 2. Why?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, there's a 5 in row 5, column 1. So the 2 from column 1 in the bottom row (row 9) moves up to row 5, where there's a 5 in column 1. So the 2 shifts to column 2 starting from row 5 upwards. So rows 5 and above (rows 0-5) have 2 in column 2, and rows 6-9 (since the 5 is in row 5) have 2 in column 1? But in the output of example 1's row 6: [0,2,2,0,2,0,0,2,5,0]. So columns 1 and 2 have 2s. That suggests that maybe after shifting, the 2s are present in both columns? Or perhaps the shift is only for rows above the 5. Wait, if the 5 is in row 5, column 1, then the 2 moving up from column 1 in row 9 would be present in rows 9,8,7,6. When it reaches row 5, the 5 is there. So rows above row 5 (0-4) have the 2 shifted to column 2. Rows 5-9: the 2 is in column 1 up to row 5, but row 5 has a 5, so perhaps in row 5, the 2 is shifted. But in the output of example 1, row 5 is [0,5,2,0,2,0,0,2,0,0]. So column 1 is 5 (from input), and column 2 is 2. So the 2 from column 1 is shifted to 2 in row 5 and above. So rows 0-4 have 2 in column 2. Rows 5-9 have 2 in column 1, except row 5, which has a 5. Wait, but row 6's column 1 is 2, and column 2 is 2. That seems like maybe the shift is only for rows above the 5. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Each 2 in the bottom row propagates upward, but whenever a 5 is encountered in the same column, the 2's path shifts to the right (column +1) starting from the row of the 5 upward.\n\nSo for each 2 in the bottom row's column c:\n\n- Move up each row.\n- If in any row r, there's a 5 in column c, then for all rows above r (including r?), the 2 is placed in column c+1 instead of c.\n- If there are multiple 5s in the same column, the highest one (lowest row number) is considered.\n\nSo for example, in example 0's 2 at column 6:\n\n- The highest 5 in column 6 is row 3. So in row 3 and above, the 2 is in column 7.\n\nSo rows 0-2 have 2 in 7, rows 3-9 have 2 in 6? No, wait in example 0's output row 3, there's a 5 in column 6 and a 2 in column 7. So perhaps the 2 in column 6 would be in row 4 and below, but in row 3 and above, it's shifted.\n\nWait maybe the 5 in column 6 (row 3) blocks the 2's path. So from the bottom up to row 3, the 2 is in column 6. Then, starting from row 3 (including row 3?), the 2 is shifted to column 7.\n\nWait, in example 0's input, the 5 is at row 3, column 6. The 2 from column 6 in the bottom row (row 9) would move up to row 3. Since there's a 5 in row 3, column 6, the 2 shifts to column 7 starting from row 3 and above. So rows 0-2 have 2 in column 7, row 3 has 2 in column 7 (and the 5 remains in 6). Rows 4-9 have the 2 in column 6. But looking at example 0's output rows:\n\nRow 3: [0,2,0,0,2,0,5,2,0,0] \u2192 column 7 is 2.\n\nRow 4: [0,2,0,0,2,0,2,2,0,0] \u2192 columns 6 and 7 are 2 and 2. Hmm, that's not explained by the previous logic. Maybe the shift is applied even to rows below the 5?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of a 5 in column c causes all 2s moving upwards through c to shift to c+1 starting at the row of the 5 and all rows below. So in example 0's 5 in row 3, column 6: the 2s moving up from column 6 would be in column 6 until they reach row 3. Then, from row 3 downwards (including row 3), they shift to column 7. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the shift occurs above the 5. So rows above the 5 (with lower row numbers) have the shifted column.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFor each 2 in the bottom row's column c:\n\n- Start at the bottom and move up row by row.\n\n- For each row, check if there's a 5 in column c. If found, then from that row upwards (higher rows, lower indices?), the 2 is placed in column c+1.\n\nWait, but row numbers are ascending from top to bottom or bottom to top? In programming, usually rows are 0-based, top to bottom. So the bottom row is row 9.\n\nSo when moving up, you go from row 9 to row 8, etc.\n\nSo for a 2 in row 9, column c:\n\n- Check each row above (row 8, 7, ... 0) for a 5 in column c.\n\n- If a 5 is found in row r, then in row r-1 and above, the 2 is placed in column c+1.\n\nWait, maybe the way to think is:\n\nFor each 2 in the bottom row (row 9), track its column c. Then, moving upwards from row 9 to row 0:\n\n- For each row, check if there's a 5 in column c. The first 5 encountered (the one in the highest row number, i.e., closest to the bottom) causes the 2 to shift to column c+1 starting from that row upwards.\n\nFor example, in example 0:\n\n- 2 in column 6 (row 9). Moving up, check each row for a 5 in column 6. The first 5 is in row 3. So from row 3 upwards (rows 0-3), the 2 is in column 7. Rows 4-9 (below the 5) have the 2 in column 6.\n\nBut in example 0's output, row 3 has a 5 in column 6 and a 2 in column 7. Rows 4 and below have 2 in column 6. That matches. So rows 0-3: column 7, rows 4-9: column 6.\n\nBut then why in example 0's output, row 4 has [0,2,0,0,2,0,2,2,0,0]. So column 6 and 7 both have 2. That's not explained by the hypothesis. So maybe there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a 2 shifts to column c+1 due to a 5 in column c, that shifted 2 (now in c+1) can also be affected by other 5s in column c+1. For example, if there's a 5 in column 7, then the shifted 2 from column 6 to 7 would shift again to 8. But in example 0, there are no 5s in column 7. So the shifted 2 would stay in column 7.\n\nBut in example 0's output, row 4 has both 6 and 7 columns as 2. So perhaps the shift is applied only once, and the original 2 continues in column 6 below the 5. So the 2 in column 6 exists in rows 9 to 3, but from row 3 upwards, it's shifted to 7. So in row 3, the 2 is in 7. But then rows below row 3 (rows 4-9) have the 2 in 6. So row 4 would have 2 in 6, but in example 0's output, row 4 has 2 in 6 and 7. That contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shifted 2 is added to the new column, but the original 2 also remains. But that doesn't seem to fit the examples.\n\nWait in example 0's output row 4: [0,2,0,0,2,0,2,2,0,0]. Columns 6 and 7 have 2s. How does that happen? According to the previous hypothesis, the 2 in column 6 should be present in rows 4-9 (since the shift happens above row 3), and column 7 in rows 0-3. But row 4 has a 2 in both columns. That suggests that maybe there's a different behavior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a 5 is encountered, the 2 splits into two: one continues in the original column, and another shifts to the right. But that complicates things, and the examples don't show that. For example, in example 0's row 4, columns 6 and 7 have 2s. Maybe there's a 5 in column 6 in row 3, which causes the 2 to split into column 7. But why would row 4 have both?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are treated as part of the 2's path, and the 2 is placed in the same column as the 5, but the 5 takes precedence. So in the output, where there's a 5, the 2 is not placed. But the 2 shifts to the next column. For example, in row 3, column 6 has a 5, so the 2 is placed in column 7 instead. So for all rows above, the 2 is in 7. For rows below, the 2 is in 6. But in row 3, the 5 is present, and the 2 is in 7. In row 4, since there's no 5 in 6, the 2 is placed in 6. But why does row 4 in example 0's output have a 2 in 7 as well?\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe it's better to find another pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: The output grids have 2s in positions that are a combination of the original 2s in the bottom row and some shifted versions due to the 5s. Maybe the 5s act as mirrors or redirect the 2s in a certain direction.\n\nAnother idea: Each row in the output is generated by taking the input's row and adding 2s in certain positions. The added 2s are based on the bottom row's 2s, but adjusted for any 5s in their path.\n\nWait, in example 0's output, the 2s are in columns 1,4,7 in the upper rows, and the bottom row's 2s are 1,4,6. So the 7 column is new. The 5 in row 3, column 6 is probably causing the shift from 6 to 7.\n\nSimilarly, in example 1's output, the upper rows have 2s in columns 2,4,7. The bottom row's 2s are 1,4,7. So column 1 shifted to 2. The 5 in row 5, column 1 is causing that shift.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: For each 2 in the bottom row's column c, look up the grid for the first 5 in column c. When found, the 2 is shifted to column c+1 starting from that row upwards. The bottom row's 2s are retained, but the shifted versions are added above.\n\nBut how does this explain multiple 5s in the same column?\n\nFor example, if there's a 5 in row r and column c, and another 5 in row s (s < r) and column c+1, then the shifted 2 from c+1 would be shifted again to c+2. But the examples don't have this scenario.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nThe bottom row (row 9) is [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. So the 2s are in columns 1,4,8.\n\nNow, for each of these columns:\n\n- Column 1: Look up from row 9 to row 0 for the first 5 in column 1. The test input has a 5 in row 4, column 1. So for this 2, the 5 is in row 4. So from row 4 upwards (rows 0-4), the 2 shifts to column 2. Rows 5-9 have the 2 in column 1.\n\nBut wait, the 2 in column 1 is in the bottom row. Moving up, the first 5 in column 1 is row 4. So rows above row 4 (0-4) have the 2 shifted to 2. Rows 5-9 have the 2 in 1.\n\nBut the bottom row is row 9, which has the 2 in 1, so rows 9,8,7,6,5 have 2 in 1, then rows 4-0 have 2 in 2.\n\n- Column 4: Look for the first 5 in column 4. Test input has a 5 in row 6, column 4. So from row 6 upwards (rows 0-6), the 2 shifts to column 5. Rows 7-9 have 2 in 4.\n\n- Column 8: Look for the first 5 in column 8. The test input has a 5 in row 2, column 7. Wait, no. Let's check the test input rows:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0] \u2192 column 7.\n\nOther 5s:\n\nRow 4: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column 1.\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column 4.\n\nSo for column 8's 2 (bottom row, column 8), looking up for a 5 in column 8. There are no 5s in column 8. So the 2 in column 8 moves up unshifted. So all rows have 2 in column 8.\n\nBut wait, the bottom row's 2 is in column 8. So when moving up, there are no 5s in column 8, so all rows have 2 in column 8.\n\nBut let's verify:\n\nFor column 8's 2:\n\n- No 5s in column 8. So the 2 propagates upwards in column 8.\n\nSo for each row, the 2 in column 8 is present.\n\nNow, combining the shifts:\n\nFor column 1's 2: shifted to column 2 in rows 0-4, column 1 in rows 5-9.\n\nFor column 4's 2: shifted to column 5 in rows 0-6, column 4 in rows 7-9.\n\nFor column 8's 2: remains in column 8 for all rows.\n\nSo the output grid would have:\n\nIn each row:\n\n- For rows 0-4:\n\n   - Column 2 (from column 1's shift)\n\n   - Column 5 (from column 4's shift)\n\n   - Column 8 (original)\n\n- For rows 5-6:\n\n   - Column 1 (since row 5 is in 5-9? Wait, row 4 is the 5 in column 1. So row 5 is below row 4, so column 1's 2 is present here.\n\nWait, row 4 has the 5. So the shift applies to rows above row 4. So rows 0-4: shifted to column 2. Rows 5-9: original column 1.\n\nSimilarly, column 4's 5 is in row 6. So rows 0-6: shifted to column 5. Rows 7-9: original column 4.\n\nSo for rows 0-4:\n\nColumns 2,5,8.\n\nFor rows 5-6:\n\nColumns 1,5,8 (since column 1's 2 is now in column 1 (rows 5-9) and column 4's shifted to 5 (rows 0-6).\n\nFor rows 7-9:\n\nColumns 1,4,8.\n\nNow, let's construct each row:\n\nRow 0: 0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0 \u2192 [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0] \u2192 but need to check if any 5s are present. The test input's row 0 has all 0s. So the output row 0 should have 2s in columns 2,5,8.\n\nWait, but according to the shifts:\n\nFor row 0 (top row):\n\n- Column 2 (from column 1's shift)\n\n- Column 5 (from column 4's shift)\n\n- Column 8 (from column 8)\n\nSo row 0: [0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0].\n\nSimilarly, row 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: original input has a 5 in column 7. So in the output, column 7 has 5. But according to our shifts, the 2s are in columns 2,5,8. So row 2's output would be:\n\n[0,0,2,0,0,2,0,5,2,0].\n\nRow 3: input is all 0s except for any 5s. So output is [0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0].\n\nRow 4: input has a 5 in column 1. So output for row 4: 2s in columns 2,5,8, and 5 in column 1. But according to the shifts, row 4 is part of the shifted rows for column 1 (0-4 shifted to 2). So row 4's output would be [0,5,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0].\n\nRow 5: now, column 1's shift is inactive (rows 5-9 have column 1), column 4's shift is active (rows 0-6 shifted to 5). So row 5's 2s are in columns 1,5,8. Input row 5 is all 0s. So output row 5: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0].\n\nRow 6: input has a 5 in column 4. So output row 6: columns 1 (from column 1's shift in rows 5-9), 5 (from column 4's shift), 8. But the input's row 6 has a 5 in column 4. So the 5 would remain. So the output row 6 would be [0,2,0,0,5,2,0,0,2,0].\n\nRow 7: column 1,4,8. Since column 4's shift is inactive here (rows 7-9), so column 4. Input row 7 is all 0s. So output row 7: [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0].\n\nRow 8: same as row 7.\n\nRow 9: input is [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. Output remains the same as the input for the bottom row.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe test input's output would have:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,2,0,0,2,0,5,2,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,5,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,2,0,0,5,2,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nWait, but looking at the training examples, the outputs have 2s in the shifted positions but also retain the original 2s in the bottom row. Wait no, the bottom row in the training examples' outputs is the same as the input's bottom row, except for example 0 where the input's bottom row has 2s in 1,4,6 and the output's bottom row has 2s in 1,4,6. So the bottom row's 2s are retained.\n\nIn the test case, the bottom row's 2s are in 1,4,8. So the output's bottom row should remain the same.\n\nBut according to the shifts, row 9's 2s are in 1,4,8 as per the input.\n\nNow, let's check if the constructed output makes sense.\n\nRow 0:\n\n[0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0] \u2192 columns 2,5,8.\n\nRow 1: same.\n\nRow 2: has a 5 in column 7, so the output row 2 is [0,0,2,0,0,2,0,5,2,0].\n\nRow 4: has a 5 in column 1, so output is [0,5,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0].\n\nRow 6: has a 5 in column 4, so output is [0,2,0,0,5,2,0,0,2,0].\n\nYes, this seems to follow the pattern from the training examples. For example, in example 0's row 3, there's a 5 in column 6 and the 2 is shifted to 7. Similarly, the test input's row 4 has a 5 in column 1, so the 2 shifts to 2 in rows 0-4.\n\nTherefore, the final output should match this structure.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a 10x10 grid of numbers, mostly zeros with some 2s and 5s. The output also has a similar structure but with more 2s added. Let's start by comparing the input and output of the first example.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the last row has 2s at positions 1, 4, and 6. The output's last row also has those 2s, but the output has additional 2s in other rows. Wait, looking at the output rows, each row starts with 0, then 2, then some zeros, then 2 again. It seems like there's a pattern where 2s are inserted in certain columns across all rows. But how?\n\nMaybe the 5s in the input are acting as some kind of markers that influence where the 2s are placed. Let's check the positions of the 5s in Example 0. The input has a 5 in row 3, column 6 (assuming rows are 0-indexed from top), and another 5 in row 5, column 2. The output has those 5s in the same positions but also adds 2s around them. For instance, in row 3 of the output, the 5 is at column 6, and there's a 2 in column 7. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the second example, Example 1. The input's last row has 2s at columns 1,4,6. The output's last row remains the same, but other rows have added 2s. The 5s in the input are at row 3 column 5, row 5 column 1, and row 6 column 8. The output preserves those 5s and adds 2s in adjacent columns. Like in row 6 of the output, there's a 5 at column 8, and a 2 at column 9? Wait, no, the output's row 6 has 5 at column 8 and 2 at column 6 maybe?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being spread upwards from the bottom row. The original input's last row has 2s, and in the output, those columns get filled with 2s in higher rows. Let's check Example 0: the last row has 2s at columns 1,4,6. In the output, every row has 2s in those columns except where there's a 5. Wait, looking at the output rows, in each row, the 2s are at columns 1,4,6,7? No, maybe not. For example, the first output row in Example 0 is [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0]. So columns 1,4,7. Wait, but the input's last row in Example 0 was [0,2,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0]. So columns 1,4,6. But the output's first row has 2s at 1,4,7. So maybe the 2s from the bottom are shifted? Or perhaps the 5s are acting as pivots.\n\nAnother angle: the output might be filling all cells in certain columns with 2s, except where there's a 5. For example, in Example 0's output, the 2s are in columns 1,4,7 in the upper rows, but in the original input's last row, the 2s were in columns 1,4,6. Wait, that doesn't align. Maybe the columns where 2s are present in the last row of the input are the columns that get filled with 2s in all rows above, except where there's a 5. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the last row has 2s at columns 1,4,6. The output's first few rows have 2s in columns 1,4,7. Hmm, not matching. Maybe there's a shift based on the 5s. Alternatively, maybe each 5 in the input causes the 2s in the same row to shift to the right. Let's look at Example 0's input row 3 (the one with the 5 at column 6). The output row 3 has 2s at columns 1,4,7, and the 5 at column 6. So in that row, the 2s are in columns 1,4,7. The original last row's 2s were in 1,4,6. So maybe the presence of a 5 causes a shift in the 2s' positions in that row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s in each row are determined by the positions of the 5s in the rows below. Like, each 5 acts as a block, and the 2s flow upwards but are shifted by the 5s. For instance, in Example 0, the 5 in row 5 (input) might influence the rows above. Let me see. The 5 in row 5, column 2. In the output rows above this 5, the 2s might be shifted. But how exactly?\n\nAnother approach: Compare the input and output for each example. Let's take Example 0. The input has three 5s: in row 3, column 6 and row 5, column 2, and the last row has 2s at 1,4,6. The output has 2s added in columns 1,4,7 in most rows. For instance, the first three output rows have 2s at 1,4,7. Then in row 3 (which had the 5 at column 6), the 2s are at 1,4,7, but the 5 is at 6. The row below that (row 4) has 2s at 1,4,6,7? Wait, in the output of Example 0, row 4 is [0,2,0,0,2,0,2,2,0,0]. So columns 1,4,6,7. Hmm. Maybe when there's a 5 in a lower row, the 2s in the rows above are adjusted to avoid overlapping with the 5's position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are propagating upwards, but when there's a 5 in a column, the 2 in that column is shifted to the right. For example, in the last row of the input, the 2s are in columns 1,4,6. But in the output rows above, the 2s are in 1,4,7. So maybe the 5 in column 6 (from row 3) caused the 2 in column 6 to shift right to column 7 in the upper rows. But how does that work across different rows?\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input's last row has 2s at 1,4,6. The output's last row is the same, but other rows have 2s in different columns. For example, the first output row in Example 1 is [0,0,2,0,2,0,0,2,0,0]. So columns 2,4,7. The original 2s in the input's last row were 1,4,6. So here, 1 shifted to 2, 6 shifted to 7. Maybe the 5s in the input are causing the 2s in the same column to shift right by one in the rows above. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the 5 in row 3, column 6. The original 2s in the last row's column 6. In the output, in rows above the 5, the 2s in column 6 are shifted to column 7. So for rows above row 3 (which has the 5 in column 6), the 2s in column 6 are moved to 7. Similarly, in row 5, column 2 of the input (Example 0) has a 5. The original 2s in column 2 (but wait, the last row of input in Example 0 has 2s in column 1,4,6. So perhaps the 5s in any row cause the 2s in their column to shift right in the rows above?\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has 5s in row 3 column 5, row 5 column 1, and row 6 column 8. The output's first three rows have 2s in columns 2,4,7. The original last row had 2s in 1,4,6. So the 5 in row 5 column 1 (input) would affect the 2 in column 1. So in rows above that 5 (row 5), the 2s in column 1 would shift to column 2. Similarly, the 5 in row 3 column 5 would cause the 2s in column 5 to shift to column 6 in rows above. But the last row's 2s are 1,4,6, so shifting 1 to 2 (due to the 5 in column 1), 4 might shift if there's a 5 in column 4, but in Example 1's input, there's no 5 in column 4. Hmm, maybe I'm not seeing the pattern correctly.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the first row has 2s in columns 2,4,7. Original last row's 2s were 1,4,6. So 1\u21922, 4 remains, 6\u21927. So perhaps whenever there's a 5 in a column below a certain row, the 2 in that column shifts right. So each 5 in any column causes the 2s in that column (from the bottom up) to shift right starting from the row above the 5. So for each 5 in a column, all the rows above that 5 in the same column have their 2 shifted right by one. But how does that work with multiple 5s in the same column?\n\nAlternatively, the 2s from the bottom row's columns are propagated upwards, but whenever a 5 is encountered in a column, the 2 in that column for the rows above are shifted right. Let me see.\n\nTake Example 0's input. Last row has 2s at columns 1,4,6. The 5s are in column 2 (row5) and column6 (row3). So in the output, for any row above row5, the 2 in column2 (from the last row's 2s?) would shift to column3? But in Example 0's output, the 2s in column2 are only in row5 (the 5 is there) and maybe others. Wait, the output in Example0's row5 is [0,2,5,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. So here, the 5 is in column2, and the 2 is in column1 (no, wait, row5 in output is [0,2,5,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]? Wait no, looking at Example0's output:\n\nExample0's output rows:\n\nRow0: [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0]\nRow1: same as row0\nRow2: same\nRow3: [0,2,0,0,2,0,5,2,0,0]\nRow4: [0,2,0,0,2,0,2,2,0,0]\nRow5: [0,2,5,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-express the input and output of Example0.\n\nInput Example0:\n\nRow3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\nRow5: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nLast row (row9): [0,2,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nOutput Example0:\n\nEach row from 0 to 2 has [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0] \u2192 2s at 1,4,7.\n\nRow3: [0,2,0,0,2,0,5,2,0,0] \u2192 2s at 1,4,7, plus the 5 at 6.\n\nRow4: [0,2,0,0,2,0,2,2,0,0] \u2192 2s at 1,4,6,7.\n\nRow5: [0,2,5,0,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 2 at 1,4, and 5 at 2.\n\nRows6-8: [0,2,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0] \u2192 2s at 1,4,6.\n\nRow9 (same as input): [0,2,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nSo for the output rows above the 5 in row3, column6, the 2s that would be in column6 (from the last row's 2 in column6) are now in column7. For example, rows0-2 have 2 in column7 instead of 6. The row4 has both 6 and7 (maybe because it's between row3 and row5?), but I'm not sure.\n\nIn row5 of the input, there's a 5 in column2. In the output, row5 has a 2 in column1 and a 5 in column2. But the original last row's 2s included column1,4,6. So maybe the presence of the 5 in column2 causes the 2s in column1 (from the bottom) to shift to column2 in rows above. But in the output rows above row5 (like row4), the 2 is in column1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, row5's output has 2 in column1, but the rows above (row4) also have 2 in column1. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input act as markers, and the 2s are filled in all columns that are to the left of the 5s in their respective rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the 2s in the output as being in the same columns as the bottom row's 2s, except where a 5 exists in a higher row in the same column. When there's a 5 in a column in a higher row, the 2s in that column above the 5 are shifted right by one. So for each column that has a 5, all rows above that 5's row in that column have the 2 shifted right.\n\nLet's test this with Example0:\n\nLast row (row9) has 2s in columns1,4,6.\n\nIn the input:\n\n- Column6 has a 5 in row3.\n- Column2 has a5 in row5.\n\nSo, for column6: rows above row3 (rows0-3) would have the 2 shifted to column7.\n\nFor column2: rows above row5 (rows0-5) would have the 2 shifted to column3.\n\nBut wait, in the output, the 2s for column1 (original from last row) are still present. So maybe this applies per column. For each 5 in a column, the 2s in that column above the 5 are shifted right by 1. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0:\n\n- Column1 has no 5s. So the 2 in column1 remains in all rows.\n- Column4 has no 5s. So 2 remains.\n- Column6 has a5 in row3. So rows above row3 (rows0-3) have their 2s shifted to column7. But in the output rows0-2 have 2 in column7, and row3 has 2 in column7 as well (since it's the row with the 5 in column6). Then, row4 (which is below row3) would have 2 in column6 again. But in the output, row4 has 2 in column6 and 7. Hmm, maybe not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, the shift happens in all rows above the 5's row. So for column6, since the 5 is in row3, rows0-2 (which are above row3) have the 2 shifted to column7. Row3 itself has the 5 and a 2 in column7. Then, rows4-8 (below row3) can have the original 2 in column6? But in the output, row4 has 2 in column6 and 7. Maybe the shift is applied from the 5's row upwards, but rows below keep the original positions.\n\nBut how does that work with multiple 5s in the same column?\n\nLooking at Example1's input:\n\nLast row (row9) has 2s in columns1,4,6,7? Wait no, Example1's input last row is [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0]. So columns1,4,6,7? Wait no, indices are 0-based. Let me check again:\n\nThe input's last row (row9) is [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0]. So columns1,4,7.\n\nIn the output, the first few rows have 2s in columns2,4,7. So columns shifted from 1\u21922, 4\u21924, 7\u21927. So maybe the 5 in column1 (row5) causes the 2s in column1 to shift to column2 in rows above.\n\nIn Example1's input, there's a 5 in row5, column1. So for column1, rows0-5 would have the 2 shifted to column2. But the original 2 in column1 is in row9. So rows above row5 (rows0-5) would have their 2 shifted from 1\u21922. Rows6-8 would remain as per original? But in the output's row6, there's a 2 in column2. Hmm, perhaps the shift applies to all rows above the 5, regardless of their original position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 in a column creates a \"shift\" effect upwards. So whenever there's a 5 in a column, all the rows above it in that column will have their 2s (from the bottom) shifted right.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\n1. The last row's 2s define the initial columns where 2s should be in all rows.\n\n2. For each 5 in the input grid, in the same column, all rows above the 5's row have their 2 shifted right by 1. If shifting causes a conflict (e.g., overlapping with another shifted 2), perhaps they just overwrite.\n\n3. The 5s themselves remain in their positions in the output.\n\nLet's test this with Example0:\n\nOriginal columns with 2s (from last row): 1,4,6.\n\n5s in column6 (row3) and column2 (row5).\n\nFor column6's 5 in row3:\n\nAll rows above row3 (rows0-3) have their 2 in column6 shifted to 7.\n\nBut in the original columns, the 2s were in 1,4,6. So in rows0-3, the 2s would be in 1,4,7 (since 6\u21927). Then, rows4-8 (below row3) would have 2s in 1,4,6. But row5 has a 5 in column2. For that 5, rows0-5 would have the 2 in column2 shifted to 3. But original columns from the last row are 1,4,6. So column2 wasn't originally a 2. Wait, perhaps this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, the 5s in any column cause the original 2s (from the last row) in that column to shift right in all rows above the 5. For example, in Example0:\n\nOriginal 2s in columns1,4,6.\n\nA 5 in column6 (row3): So in rows0-3, the 2 in column6 is shifted to 7.\n\nA 5 in column2 (row5): But the original 2s are not in column2. So this 5 doesn't affect the 2s. Wait, but the output in Example0's row5 has a 5 in column2 and a 2 in column1. So maybe this 5 doesn't affect the 2s from the last row. But how?\n\nMaybe the 5s in columns that are not part of the original 2 columns (from last row) don't affect the shifting. Only 5s in columns where the last row has a 2 cause a shift.\n\nWait, in Example0's input, the last row has 2s in columns1,4,6. The 5 in column6 (row3) is in a column where the last row has a 2. So this 5 causes the 2s in column6, rows0-3, to shift to column7. The 5 in column2 (row5) is in a column that the last row does not have a 2. So this 5 doesn't affect the shifting.\n\nBut in Example1, the input's last row has 2s in columns1,4,7. The 5s are in column5 (row3), column1 (row5), and column8 (row6). So for the 5 in column1 (row5), since the last row has a 2 in column1, rows above row5 (rows0-5) have their 2 shifted to column2. The 5 in column5 (row3) is in a column not in the last row's 2s, so it doesn't affect shifting. The 5 in column8 (row6) is also not in a 2 column of the last row, so no shift.\n\nSo applying this rule:\n\n- For each 5 in a column that has a 2 in the last row's column, all rows above that 5's row in that column have their 2 shifted right by 1.\n\nLet's check Example0:\n\nOriginal 2 columns:1,4,6.\n\n5 in column6 (row3). So rows0-3 in column6 shift to 7. So in output, rows0-3 have 2s in 1,4,7. Rows4-9 (since row3 is the 5's row) have 2s in 1,4,6. But in the output, rows4 has 2s in 1,4,6,7. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Maybe the rows below the 5's row are unaffected. So rows4-8 would have the original 2s. But in Example0's output, row4 has 2s in 1,4,6,7. So there's a 2 in both 6 and 7. That might be due to another 5 in a lower row?\n\nWait, in Example0's input, there's a 5 in row5, column2. But column2 is not a 2 column in the last row, so it doesn't affect the shifting. But row5's output has a 2 in column1 and 4, and a 5 in column2. So maybe that's unrelated.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the 2s are generated by taking the last row's 2s and then for each 5 in the grid, the column of the 5 causes the 2s in that column to shift right starting from the row above.\n\nSo, for example, in Example0:\n\nOriginal 2 columns:1,4,6.\n\n5s in columns6 (row3) and 2 (row5).\n\nFor the 5 in column6, row3: in the rows above (0-3), the 2s in column6 are shifted to 7.\n\nFor the 5 in column2, row5: since column2 is not a 2 column in the last row, no shift.\n\nThus, the output's 2 columns would be:\n\n- For column1: no 5s, so 2 remains in all rows.\n\n- For column4: no 5s, 2 remains.\n\n- For column6: shifted to 7 in rows0-3, remains in rows4-9.\n\nBut in the output of Example0, rows0-3 have 2 in 7, rows4 and below have 2 in 6 and 7. Wait, row4 in Example0's output has 2 in 6 and 7. That might be because there's another 5 in a lower row. Or perhaps the shift is applied for each 5 in a column, and multiple shifts can occur.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 5 in a column causes a single shift right for all rows above it. So if a column has multiple 5s, the shifts would accumulate. For example, if there's a 5 in row3 and another in row5 of the same column, the rows above row3 would shift once, and rows above row5 would shift again. But this seems complicated.\n\nLet's look at the test input now. The test input's last row is [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. So columns1,4,8. The 5s are in row2 column7, row4 column1, and row6 column4.\n\nApplying the rule: for each 5 in a column that is one of the last row's 2 columns (1,4,8), check if the 5 is in those columns. The 5 in row4 column1: column1 is a 2 column. So rows above row4 (rows0-4) would have their 2s in column1 shifted to column2.\n\nThe 5 in row6 column4: column4 is a 2 column. So rows above row6 (rows0-6) would have their 2s in column4 shifted to column5.\n\nThe 5 in row2 column7: column7 is not a 2 column in the last row (last row's 2s are in 8, not 7), so no shift.\n\nSo the 2 columns after shifts:\n\n- Original columns1,4,8.\n\nShift for column1 (due to 5 in row4):\n\nRows0-4: column1\u21922.\n\nRows5-9: column1 remains.\n\nShift for column4 (due to 5 in row6):\n\nRows0-6: column4\u21925.\n\nRows7-9: column4 remains.\n\nShift for column8 (no 5s): no shift.\n\nSo the new 2 columns would be:\n\nFor rows0-4: columns2 (from 1),5 (from4),8.\n\nFor rows5-6: column1 (original),5 (from4),8.\n\nFor rows7-9: column1 (original),4 (original),8.\n\nWait, let's break it down:\n\nRow 0: above row4 and row6. So column1\u21922, column4\u21925. So 2s in 2,5,8.\n\nRow1: same as row0.\n\nRow2: same as row0, but there's a 5 in column7. So 2s in 2,5,8.\n\nRow3: same as row0.\n\nRow4: same as row0 (since row4 is the row with the 5 in column1). So 2s in 2,5,8.\n\nRow5: above row6. So column4\u21925. So 2s in 1,5,8.\n\nRow6: the row with 5 in column4. So rows above row6 (rows0-6) have column4 shifted to5. But row6 itself is not above, so row6's 2s would be 1,5,8.\n\nBut row6 in the test input has a 5 in column4. Wait, the test input's row6 is [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0]. So column4 has a5.\n\nSo according to the rule, for column4, rows0-6 would have their 2 shifted to5. But the original 2s are in columns1,4,8. So for column4, shifting to5 in rows0-6. So for rows0-6:\n\n- column1: shifted to2 (due to row4's 5 in column1).\n\n- column4: shifted to5 (due to row6's 5 in column4).\n\n- column8: no shift.\n\nThus, in rows0-6, the 2s are in columns2,5,8.\n\nFor rows7-9:\n\n- column1: original (no shift, since the 5 is in row4, and rows7-9 are below row4).\n\n- column4: original (no shift, since the 5 is in row6, and rows7-9 are below row6).\n\n- column8: original.\n\nSo rows7-9 have 2s in columns1,4,8.\n\nBut the last row (row9) in the test input is [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0], which is columns1,4,8. But according to the rule, it remains unchanged as it's the last row. However, in the output, the last row might be the same as the input's last row except where there's a5. Wait, in the training examples, the last row of input is part of the output. For example, in Example0's input, the last row is [0,2,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0], and in the output, it's the same. Similarly, Example1's last row in input and output are the same.\n\nSo in the test case, the last row would stay the same. The other rows are modified based on the 5s.\n\nSo applying this to the test input's rows:\n\nOriginal last row: columns1,4,8.\n\nFor each row from 0 to8:\n\n- For column1: if the row is above row4 (rows0-3), shift to column2.\n\n- For column4: if the row is above row6 (rows0-5), shift to column5.\n\n- Column8: no shifts.\n\nSo:\n\nRows0-3: 2s in columns2 (from1),5 (from4),8.\n\nRow4: since row4 is the row with the 5 in column1, rows0-4 (including row4) have column1 shifted to2. But row4's input has a5 in column1. So in row4's output, the column1 becomes 5, and column2 is 2. Also, column4 is shifted to5 if above row6. Since row4 is below row6? No, row4 is above row6, so column4 shifts to5. So row4's 2s would be in columns2,5,8, and the 5 in column1.\n\nRow5: same as rows0-3 for columns1 and4 (shifted to2 and5), so 2s in 2,5,8.\n\nRow6: column4 is shifted to5 (since row6 is the row with the 5 in column4. So rows0-6: column4\u21925. So row6's 2s are 2,5,8. But row6's input has a5 in column4. So in the output, column4 is 5, and column5 is 2.\n\nRows7-8: columns1,4,8. No shifts.\n\nNow, let's construct each row of the test input's output:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: same as row0.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nApplying the shifts:\n\nRow0: columns2,5,8 \u2192 [0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0] ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the 2s should be placed in columns2,5,8. So each element in those columns is 2. So:\n\nRow0 output: [0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0]\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the output rows have varying numbers of 2s. Let's check Example0's output rows. The first three rows have [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0], which is columns1,4,7. But according to our earlier analysis, the shifts would have caused the 2s to be in columns1,4,7. Wait, but according to our current rule for the test input, the shifts are based on 5s in certain columns.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way the shifting works is that for each 5 in a column, any 2 in that column (from the last row's columns) in the rows above the 5 are shifted right by one. So for the test input:\n\nLast row's 2 columns:1,4,8.\n\n5s in columns1 (row4),4 (row6), and7 (row2). But column7 is not a 2 column, so only 5s in columns1 and4 are relevant.\n\nSo for column1, 5 is in row4. So all rows above row4 (rows0-3) have their 2 in column1 shifted to2.\n\nFor column4, 5 is in row6. So all rows above row6 (rows0-5) have their 2 in column4 shifted to5.\n\nThus:\n\nFor rows0-3:\n\n- column1 \u21922\n\n- column4 \u21925\n\nSo 2s are in 2,5,8.\n\nFor rows4-5:\n\n- column1: row4 has 5 in column1. So rows4-5 are not above row4 (row4 is the same as the 5's row). So column1 remains 2 only if it's part of the original columns. Wait, no. The original 2 in column1 is in the last row. But according to the rule, rows above the 5's row have shifted. So rows4 and5 are not above row4, so column1's 2 is not shifted. However, column4 in rows0-5 (above row6) are shifted to5. So for rows4 and5:\n\n- column4 shifted to5.\n\n- column1 remains.\n\nSo rows4 and5 have 2s in columns1,5,8.\n\nRow4 has a5 in column1 (input), so in output, column1 is5, and column2 is2 (shifted from column1). Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me think again. The 5s in a column cause the 2s in that column (from the last row's columns) to shift right in the rows above the 5. So:\n\nFor column1, 5 in row4:\n\n- All rows above row4 (rows0-3) have their 2 shifted to column2.\n\n- Rows4-9 retain the original 2 in column1, except where there's a5.\n\nBut row4 has a5 in column1, so in the output, column1 is5, and the shifted 2 from column1 (now column2) would be there. But row4 is not above the 5's row (since it's the same row). So for row4:\n\n- The original 2 in column1 is shifted to column2 if the row is above the 5's row. Since row4 is the same as the 5's row, does it shift or not?\n\nAccording to the training examples, in Example0's row3 (where the 5 is in column6), the output row3 has 5 in column6 and 2 in column7. So perhaps in the row where the 5 is located, the 2 is shifted.\n\nBut in Example0's row5, which has a5 in column2, the output row5 has 5 in column2 and a2 in column1. Wait, but according to the rule, the 2 in column2 (from the last row) would be shifted to column3 in rows above. But in Example0's last row, column2 doesn't have a 2. So this is confusing.\n\nMaybe the 5s in any column cause the 2s in that column to shift right in all rows above, regardless of whether the column had a 2 in the last row. But then, for example, if a 5 is in a column that the last row doesn't have a 2, but there's a 2 in higher rows due to shifts from other columns, does that affect it?\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try applying the rule to the test input and see if the resulting output matches the training examples' pattern.\n\nTest input's last row: columns1,4,8.\n\n5s in columns1 (row4),4 (row6), and7 (row2).\n\nProcessing each column:\n\nColumn1:\n\n- 5 in row4. So rows0-3: 2s shifted to column2.\n\n- Rows4-9: 2s remain in column1, except row4 has a5.\n\nSo:\n\n- Rows0-3: column2 has 2.\n\n- Rows4: column1 is5, column2 is2 (from shift).\n\n- Rows5-9: column1 has 2 (from last row).\n\nColumn4:\n\n- 5 in row6. So rows0-5: 2s shifted to column5.\n\n- Rows6-9: 2s remain in column4, except row6 has a5.\n\nSo:\n\n- Rows0-5: column5 has 2.\n\n- Rows6: column4 is5, column5 is2 (from shift).\n\n- Rows7-9: column4 has 2.\n\nColumn8:\n\n- No 5s. So 2s remain in all rows.\n\nNow, let's construct each row:\n\nRow0: columns2 (from1),5 (from4),8 \u2192 [0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow1: same as row0.\n\nRow2: has a5 in column7. But columns2,5,8 \u2192 [0,0,2,0,0,2,0,5,2,0]\n\nRow3: same as row0.\n\nRow4: 5 in column1, so column1 is5. Shifted from column1 to2 (row4 is not above, but maybe since the 5 is in this row, the shift is applied. So column2 has 2. Column5 (shifted from4), and column8. \u2192 [0,5,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow5: columns1 (since row5 is not above row4's 5?), column5 (from4 shift), and8 \u2192 [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow6: 5 in column4. Shifted from4 to5. So columns1 (from last row's column1),5 (from4),8. But row6's column4 is5. \u2192 [0,2,0,0,5,2,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow7: columns1,4 (from original, since it's below row6),8 \u2192 [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow8: same as row7.\n\nRow9: same as input.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n[0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0] \u2192 row0\n\n[0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0] \u2192 row1\n\n[0,0,2,0,0,2,0,5,2,0] \u2192 row2\n\n[0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0] \u2192 row3\n\n[0,5,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0] \u2192 row4\n\n[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0] \u2192 row5\n\n[0,2,0,0,5,2,0,0,2,0] \u2192 row6\n\n[0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0] \u2192 row7\n\n[0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0] \u2192 row8\n\n[0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0] \u2192 row9 (same as input)\n\nWait, but looking at the training examples, the outputs often have multiple 2s per row. For example, in Example0's output, row0 has 2s in columns1,4,7. So our test output for row0 has 2s in 2,5,8, which seems different. Maybe there's a mistake in the shifting logic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shifts are cumulative. For example, if a column is shifted multiple times due to multiple 5s, but that seems unlikely given the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shifting is not per column but per cell. For each 5, it affects the cells above it by moving any 2 in that column to the right.\n\nBut given the time I've spent, perhaps I should look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in both training examples, the output rows have the same number of 2s as the last row's 2s, but their positions change based on the 5s. For instance, Example0's last row has three 2s. Each output row has three 2s, except those with 5s. So the total number of 2s per row is preserved, but their positions are adjusted based on 5s.\n\nPerhaps the 5s act as blockages, causing the 2s to flow upwards but being displaced to the right when a 5 is in the same column. So each 2 in the last row moves upwards, and if there's a 5 in their path (same column), they shift right.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nThe last row's 2s are in columns1,4,6.\n\n- The 2 in column1 moves up, no 5 in column1, so stays.\n\n- The 2 in column4 moves up, no 5 in column4, so stays.\n\n- The 2 in column6 moves up, but in row3 there's a5. So in row3, the 2 shifts to column7. Then continues up from there.\n\nSimilarly, in row5, there's a5 in column2, but the 2 in column2 wasn't present, so no shift.\n\nIn Example1's input, last row's 2s are in columns1,4,7.\n\n- The 2 in column1 moves up, but in row5 there's a5 in column1. So in rows above row5, the 2 shifts to column2.\n\n- The 2 in column4 moves up, no 5 in column4, so stays.\n\n- The 2 in column7 moves up, no 5 in column7, so stays.\n\nThis explains why in Example1's output, the 2s are in columns2,4,7 for rows above row5.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each 2 in the last row's columns, they propagate upwards. If they encounter a 5 in the same column, they shift right by one from that row upwards.\n\nSo for each column with a 2 in the last row:\n\n- Move up each row. If a 5 is encountered in that column, then from that row upwards, the 2 shifts to the next column (right by one).\n\nThus, the algorithm would be:\n\n1. For each column in the last row that has a 2, track upwards.\n\n2. For each such column, check if there's a 5 in any row above (lower row index) in that column.\n\n3. The highest (smallest row index) 5 in that column determines where the shift starts.\n\n4. From that 5's row upwards, the 2 shifts to the next column (right by one).\n\n5. If the shifted column also has a 5, it may cause another shift, but based on the training examples, it seems only one shift per original column.\n\nLet's apply this to the test input:\n\nTest input's last row has 2s in columns1,4,8.\n\nFor each of these columns:\n\nColumn1:\n\nCheck if there's any 5 in this column in rows above (rows0-8). Yes, there's a5 in row4.\n\nSo from row4 upwards (rows0-4), the 2 shifts to column2.\n\nColumn4:\n\nCheck for 5s in this column. There's a5 in row6.\n\nSo from row6 upwards (rows0-6), the 2 shifts to column5.\n\nColumn8:\n\nNo 5s in this column. So 2 remains in column8 for all rows.\n\nSo the resulting 2 positions per row:\n\nFor column1's 2:\n\n- Rows5-9: column1 (since the 5 is in row4, rows5-9 are below and not shifted).\n\n- Rows0-4: column2 (shifted from1).\n\nFor column4's 2:\n\n- Rows7-9: column4 (below row6's 5).\n\n- Rows0-6: column5 (shifted from4).\n\nFor column8's 2: all rows in column8.\n\nSo combining:\n\nEach row's 2s are:\n\nFor rows0-4:\n\n- column2 (from1), column5 (from4), column8.\n\nFor rows5-6:\n\n- column1 (from1, since they are below row4's 5), column5 (from4, since they are above row6's 5), column8.\n\nFor rows7-9:\n\n- column1, column4, column8.\n\nNow, let's construct each row:\n\nRow0: [0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow1: same as row0.\n\nRow2: same as row0, but with a5 in column7 \u2192 [0,0,2,0,0,2,0,5,2,0]\n\nRow3: same as row0.\n\nRow4: has a5 in column1. So column1 is5, column2 is2 (shifted), column5 is2 (shifted from4), column8 is2 \u2192 [0,5,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow5: column1 is2 (since below row4), column5 is2 (shifted from4), column8 is2 \u2192 [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow6: column5 is2 (shifted from4), and there's a5 in column4 \u2192 [0,2,0,0,5,2,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow7: column1,4,8 \u2192 [0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0]\n\nRow8: same as row7.\n\nRow9: same as input's last row.\n\nNow, comparing this to the training examples' output format:\n\nEach output row is a list of 10 elements, mostly zeros with 2s and 5s. The 5s are in the same positions as the input.\n\nThe test input's 5s are in row2 column7, row4 column1, row6 column4. So these should remain in the output.\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0]\n\nBut according to the training examples, the outputs have the 5s and the shifted 2s. Let's check if the constructed rows match.\n\nYes, the 5s are in their original positions, and the 2s are shifted according to the rules.\n\nThus, the final answer should be as follows:",
