        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these training examples where each input is a list of lists (arrays) of numbers, and the output is another list of lists. The key is to find out how the input arrays are transformed into the output arrays.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the input has 23 arrays, each of length 21. The output has 6 arrays, each of length 8. Hmm, so maybe the number of output arrays is less than the input. Let me check the other examples. Example 1 has 13 input arrays, and 5 output arrays. Example 2 has 17 input arrays and 8 output arrays. So the output arrays are fewer than the input. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps each output array is formed by combining certain elements from the input arrays. Let me look for a pattern in how elements are selected. Let's take Example 0's first input array:\n\n[3, 8, 8, 0, 3, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 0, 3, 8, 3, 8]\n\nThe corresponding output's first array is [0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]. Let's see if these numbers appear in the input array. The input has 0s at positions 3, 7, 9, 14, etc. The output starts with 0,0,8,0. Maybe it's taking elements from the end? Let's check the last few elements of the input array: ...0,3,8,3,8. The output ends with 3,3,3,3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays are formed by taking the elements that follow a certain number, like after a 2? Wait, looking at the inputs in Example 0, some arrays have a sequence of 2s. For example, the fourth input array in Example 0 is [5, 3, 0, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3]. The output for Example 0's fourth array is [5, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1]. Wait, but in the input array, after the long sequence of 2s, the elements are 1, 1, 0, 3, etc. Maybe the output is taking elements after a run of 2s? Let me check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1's seventh input array: [3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9]. The output for Example 1 is [3, 3, 0], [9, 3, 9], etc. Wait, the seventh input array has a run of 4s. Then after that comes 6, 0,0,0,9. Maybe the output is taking the elements after the run of a specific number (like 4 in this case) but how?\n\nIn Example 2's input, there are arrays with runs of 8s, like the third input array: [0,5,5,8,8,...,8,5,0,0]. The output includes arrays that might be taking elements after the 8s. For example, the third input array's output is [0,0,5,3,3,3,2,2,5,0]. Wait, after the 8s in the input, the elements are 5,3,3,3,2,2,5,0. That matches the start of the output. So maybe the pattern is: in each input array, find the longest consecutive sequence of a certain number (like 2,4,8), and take the elements after that sequence to form the output array. But how is the certain number determined?\n\nLooking at Example 0's fourth input array: [5,3,0,8,2,2,...,2,1,1,0,3,0,0,3]. The 2s are a long run. The output for this input array is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Wait, after the 2s in the input, the next elements are 1,1,0,3,0,0,3. The output starts with 5, which is before the 2s. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the outputs are formed by taking the elements that follow a run of a certain number, but the certain number varies per input array. For example, in Example 0's first input array, maybe the run is 8,8,0, but not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the Test Input. One of the input arrays is [8,0,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,2]. The output might need to take elements after the run of 3s. The elements after the 3s are 0,2. But the output arrays in the training examples are longer than that. So maybe it's not that.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the lengths. In Example 0, each input array is 21 elements, and the output arrays are 8 elements. 21 divided by 8 doesn't fit. But maybe each output array is formed from a specific position in the input arrays. For example, maybe the output arrays are the last n elements of each input array. Let's check. The first input array in Example 0 has 21 elements; output is 8 elements. Last 8 elements of input are [8,0,3,8,3,8]. Wait, no. The input is length 21, so last 8 would be positions 13 to 20: 1,8,8,0,3,8,3,8. The output is [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array is taking every third element or something. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input. The seventh input array is [3,6,4,4,4,4,4,6,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9]. The output includes [3,3,0]. Maybe the output is taking the elements after the run of 4s. The elements after 4s are 6,0,0,0,9... So 6,0,0, but the output is [3,3,0]. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the output arrays are formed by combining elements from multiple input arrays. For example, the output arrays might be the concatenation of the first elements of each input array. But in Example 0, there are 23 input arrays, and the output has 6 arrays. Not sure.\n\nWait, the number of output arrays in each example seems to be roughly the number of input arrays divided by 3 or 4. For example, 23 input arrays \u2192 6 outputs (23/4\u22486). 13 input \u21925 outputs (13/3\u22484.3, but 5). 17\u21928. Maybe each output array is formed from a group of 3 or 4 input arrays. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is selecting certain input arrays based on a criteria. Like, every fourth array in the input becomes part of the output. But Example 0 has 23 input arrays and 6 outputs. 23/6\u22483.8. Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array is formed by taking elements from the input arrays where a certain number (like 2,4,8) is present in a consecutive sequence. Let's check Example 0's fourth input array again. It has a long run of 2s, and the output for that array is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. The elements after the 2s in the input are 1,1,0,3,0,0,3. But the output starts with 5, which is before the 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the elements before the run of a certain number. Let's see. For Example 0's fourth input array: the run of 2s starts at position 4. The elements before that are 5,3,0,8. But the output starts with 5,1,3,0. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays are the elements that are between runs of a certain number. For instance, between two runs of 2s. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the Test Input. Let's see if there's a pattern in the input arrays. For example, the fifth input array is [1,0,8,3,2,0,8,1,1,1,0,1,0,3,0,0]. There's a 2 here. Maybe when there's a 2, the following elements are taken. But in Example 0, some arrays have 2s. Let me check Example 0's fourth input array again: the 2s are a long run. The output for that input array is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. The elements after the 2s are 1,1,0,3, etc. But the output starts with 5, which is before the 2s. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the elements that come before the first occurrence of a specific number. For example, in Example 0's fourth input array, maybe the output is the elements before the first 2. The input starts with 5,3,0,8, then 2. So elements before 2 are [5,3,0,8]. The output is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. That's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the elements after the first occurrence of a certain number. For example, after the first 2. But in the fourth input array of Example 0, after the first 2, there's a long run. The elements after the first 2 would be the rest of the 2s and then 1,1, etc. But the output for that array starts with 5, which is before the 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output is formed by taking elements around the positions where the input arrays have a specific number. For example, if the number 2 appears in an input array, take the elements around it. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are not part of the longest consecutive sequence in each input array. For instance, in Example 0's fourth input array, the longest sequence is 10 2s. The output could be the elements excluding those 2s. Let's check. The input array is [5,3,0,8,2,2,...,2,1,1,0,3,0,0,3]. If we remove the 10 2s, the remaining elements are [5,3,0,8,1,1,0,3,0,0,3]. The output for this array is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Hmm, not matching exactly. The output starts with 5, then 1,3,0. The input after removing 2s has 5,3,0,8, then 1,1, etc. So perhaps the output is the elements before and after the run of 2s. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the output is the elements before the run and the elements after the run concatenated. For the fourth input array in Example 0, before the 2s: [5,3,0,8], after the 2s: [1,1,0,3,0,0,3]. Concatenating them gives [5,3,0,8,1,1,0,3,0,0,3]. The output is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Not matching. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output arrays are formed by taking the first occurrence of a certain number and then the following numbers until another condition is met. Not sure.\n\nLooking back at Example 2, the third input array is [0,5,5,8,8,...,8,5,0,0]. The output array here is [0,0,5,3,3,3,2,2,5,0]. The elements after the 8s are 5,0,0. But the output starts with 0,0,5, etc. Hmm, not directly.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is taking the elements that follow the longest consecutive run of a certain number. For example, in each input array, find the longest run of a number (like 2, 4, 8, etc.) and take the elements after that run. Let's check this hypothesis.\n\nTake Example 0's fourth input array again. The longest run is 10 2s. The elements after are 1,1,0,3,0,0,3. But the output for this array is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Wait, that doesn't match. Unless the output includes elements before the run as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements before and after the longest run. But again, not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's seventh input array: [3,6,4,4,4,4,4,6,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9]. The longest run is 5 4s. The elements after are 6,0,0,0,9,... The output array for Example 1 includes [3,3,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Another approach: perhaps the outputs are the elements that are surrounded by zeros or something. For example, in Example 0's first input array, the output starts with 0,0,8,0. The input has 0s at positions 3,7,9, etc. Maybe the output is extracting sequences between zeros. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the outputs could be the result of some mathematical operation on the input elements, like summing adjacent pairs or differences. For example, the output elements might be the differences between consecutive elements. Let's check Example 0's first input array. The input is [3,8,8,0,3,8,8,0,8,0,3,1,1,1,8,8,0,3,8,3,8]. The output starts with [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]. If I take the differences: 3-8=-5, 8-8=0, 8-0=8, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is grouping numbers into pairs and applying a rule. For example, (3,8) becomes 0, (8,8) becomes 0, (0,3) becomes 8, etc. But this seems arbitrary without a clear pattern.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's output. One of the output arrays is [5,2,5,2,5,0,2,2,2,2]. Looking at the corresponding input array (the eighth one in Example 2's input):\n\n[5,0,5,8,0,5,2,5,0,0,0,0,3,3,8,0,0,5]\n\nAfter the 8 in position 3, there's 0,5,2,5,0,0,0,0,3,3,8,0,0,5. The output array is [5,2,5,2,5,0,2,2,2,2]. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output arrays are the elements from the input arrays where the index modulo a certain number equals a specific value. For example, taking every third element starting from a certain point. Let's see. In Example 0's first output array [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3], maybe the elements are from positions 3,7,9, etc. Let's check:\n\nInput array 0: positions 3 (0), 7 (0), 9 (0), 14 (8), etc. So 0,0,0,8,... Not matching the output [0,0,8,0,...]. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the outputs are the elements that are palindromic in some way. For instance, the output arrays might form a palindrome, but looking at Example 0's outputs, they don't seem to be palindromes.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the result of counting occurrences of certain numbers in the input arrays. But the outputs have varying numbers, not counts.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps each output array is formed by taking a certain number of elements from each input array. For example, taking the first and last element of each input array. But in Example 0, input arrays are 21 elements, output is 8 elements. So 21 elements can't be split into 8 elements per input array.\n\nWait, maybe the output arrays are formed by concatenating parts of multiple input arrays. For example, each output array is made by taking a slice from one input array. In Example 0, there are 23 input arrays and 6 outputs. So maybe every 3 or 4 input arrays contribute to one output array. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays are the transpose of the input matrix. For example, if the input is a matrix of 23 rows (each of length 21), the output is taking columns 0-7 (since output arrays are 8 elements long). But transposing would require that all input arrays are the same length. In Example 0, each input array is 21 elements, so transposing would create 21 output arrays of 23 elements each. But the output has 6 arrays of 8 elements. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of merging multiple input arrays by selecting elements where a certain number (like 2,4,8) appears. For example, in the Test Input, some arrays have runs of 3s. Like the fifth input array: [8,0,8,3,3,...,3,0,2]. Maybe the output is elements after the 3s. So after 10 3s, the elements are 0,2. But the output arrays in the training examples are longer than that. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's third input array: [0,5,5,8,8,...,8,5,0,0]. The output array is [0,0,5,3,3,3,2,2,5,0]. The elements after the run of 8s are 5,0,0. But the output starts with 0,0,5. The 5,0,0 are from the input after 8s. So maybe the output includes the elements from the end of the input array. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the elements from the input array starting at the first occurrence of a certain number. For example, in Example 0's fourth input array, the first 2 is at position 4. Taking elements starting from position 4: [2,2,...,2,1,1,0,3, etc.]. But the output for that array starts with 5, which is before position 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's try to look for other patterns. In Example 0's output arrays, the first output array is [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]. Looking at the input arrays, maybe this output is derived from the first input array. Let's see: the first input array ends with ...,3,8,3,8. But the output doesn't match that.\n\nWait, looking at the Test Input's fifth array: [1,0,8,3,2,0,8,1,1,1,0,1,0,3,0,0]. The number 2 is present here. In Example 0's input arrays, the presence of 2s seems to correlate with the output arrays. So maybe when an input array contains a 2, the output is formed by taking elements after the 2. For example, in the Test Input's fifth array, after the 2, the elements are 0,8,1,1,1,0,1,0,3,0,0. But the output arrays in the training examples vary in length. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are not part of the longest consecutive number in the input array. For instance, if the longest run is of 2s, then the output is the rest of the elements. Let's check Example 0's fourth input array again: the longest run is 10 2s. The rest of the elements are [5,3,0,8,1,1,0,3,0,0,3]. The output for this array is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. So 5 is the first element, then 1, which is part of the elements after the 2s. So maybe the output is combining elements before and after the run, but not the run itself. But how does it choose how many elements to take?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first element of the input array, followed by elements after the longest run. For Example 0's fourth input array, first element is 5, then after the 2s, the elements are 1,1,0,3, etc. But the output starts with 5,1,3,0. That could fit. Let's check another example.\n\nIn Example 2's third input array, the longest run is of 8s. The first element is 0, and after the 8s, we have 5,0,0. The corresponding output is [0,0,5,3,3,3,2,2,5,0]. Hmm, not sure. The first element is 0, then 0,5, etc. Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example 0's fourth output array [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1], maybe this is formed by taking the first element (5), then the elements after the longest run (1,1,0,3, etc.), but only taking some of them. For example, take first element, then every other element after the run. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the Test Input's fourth array: [8,0,8,3,3,...,3,0,2]. The longest run is of 10 3s. The elements after are 0,2. The output might need to take the first element (8) and then elements after the run (0,2), but that's only two elements. But training examples have output arrays of varying lengths, like 8,3,10 elements. This approach might not work.\n\nMaybe the output is the elements that are between runs of a certain number. For example, between runs of 2s. But in Example 0's fourth input array, there's a single run of 2s. So maybe not.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the output arrays are the result of counting occurrences of certain numbers in the input arrays. For example, if the input array has a run of 2s, the output could be the count of other numbers before or after. But the output arrays have numbers that appear in the input, so that's unlikely.\n\nWait, looking at the first output array in Example 0: [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]. The input arrays have 0s and 3s. Maybe the output is the counts of certain numbers. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output might be the elements that follow a specific pattern, like the number 3 followed by a 8, then taking the next elements. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to look for another pattern. In Example 0's output, each array is 8 elements long. The input arrays have varying lengths but in the examples, each input array is 21 elements long. Wait, Example 0's input has arrays of length 21, and the output arrays are 8 elements. 21 is 3*7, 8 is 2*4. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps each output array is formed by taking the elements from the input array starting from the first occurrence of a certain number and then taking the next 7 elements. For example, in Example 0's fourth input array, if the certain number is 1, then the first occurrence is at position 10 (element 1). Then take the next 7 elements: 1,0,3,0,0,3. But that's only 6 elements. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output array is formed by taking the elements from the input array starting from the position where a certain number occurs for the second time. But not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the Test Input's fifth array: [1,0,8,3,2,0,8,1,1,1,0,1,0,3,0,0]. If there's a 2 here, maybe the output starts after the 2. So elements after 2 are 0,8,1,1,1,0,1,0,3,0,0. But the output arrays in the training examples have varying lengths. So perhaps the output is the next n elements after the first occurrence of 2. But in Example 0, some input arrays don't have 2s. For instance, the first input array in Example 0 has no 2s, but its output is [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]. So that approach wouldn't work.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the outputs are the result of applying a Caesar cipher-like shift to the input elements, but that seems unlikely since the numbers vary widely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the cumulative sum modulo some number. For example, the first output array in Example 0 starts with 0,0,8, etc. Let's try summing the input elements modulo 9 or something. For Example 0's first input array, summing elements up to certain points. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays are the elements that are palindromes when read forward and backward within the input array. But Example 0's first output is [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3], which is not a palindrome.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to consider the possibility that each output array is derived from a specific input array by taking a subsequence. For example, the first output array in Example 0 is derived from the first input array. Let's check:\n\nInput array 0: [3,8,8,0,3,8,8,0,8,0,3,1,1,1,8,8,0,3,8,3,8]\n\nOutput array 0: [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]\n\nLooking for this sequence in the input. The input has 0s at positions 3,7,9, etc. The output starts with 0,0,8. Looking at the input, after position 3 (0), the next 0 is at position 7, then 9. So 0 at 3, next 0 at 7, then 8 at position 6 (8) or 8 at position 2 (but that's earlier). Hmm, not matching. \n\nWait, maybe the output is the unique elements in the input array, but ordered. For Example 0's first input array, unique elements are 0,1,3,8. Output is [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]. So 0s and 3s. Not exactly unique.\n\nAnother thought: the output arrays could be the result of run-length encoding. For example, taking the lengths of runs of certain numbers. For Example 0's fourth input array has a run of 10 2s. The output for that array is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. 10 in binary is 1010, but not sure how that connects.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array is formed by taking the digits of a number derived from the input array. For example, sum of elements converted to digits. But this seems complicated.\n\nLet me try to find a common element in all examples. For instance, in Example 0's input arrays, some have long runs of 2s. The output arrays for those input arrays are present. Similarly, in Example 1's inputs, some have runs of 4s. Example 2 has runs of 8s. The Test Input has runs of 3s and others.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is: for each input array, if there is a run of a certain number (like 2,4,8,3), then take the elements after that run and form the output array. If there are multiple runs, take the longest one.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example 0's fourth input array:\n\nInput: [5,3,0,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,0,3,0,0,3]\n\nLongest run is 10 2s. Elements after the run: 1,1,0,3,0,0,3. The output array for this input is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Wait, the output starts with 5 which is before the run. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the elements before the longest run. The elements before the 2s in this input are 5,3,0,8. But the output for this array is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Which doesn't match. So maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output arrays are formed by taking elements from the input arrays where the elements are not part of any run. For example, single elements or non-consecutive numbers. But in Example 0's fourth input array, after the 2s, there are 1,1 which is a run. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are part of runs of a certain length. For example, if a run has exactly two elements, take those. But the output arrays don't seem to follow this.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think differently. Maybe the output arrays are the result of some transformation applied to each input array independently. For example, each input array is transformed into an output array by a certain rule.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input array and output:\n\nInput: [3,8,8,0,3,8,8,0,8,0,3,1,1,1,8,8,0,3,8,3,8]\n\nOutput: [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]\n\nNotice that the output starts with 0s, which appear in the input. The output has four 3s at the end. The input has several 3s towards the end: positions 10, 17, 19. So maybe the output is the number of times certain numbers appear. But the output has 0s and 3s. Maybe counting the occurrences of 0s and 3s. Let's count:\n\nIn the input array, the number of 0s: positions 3,7,9, 16 \u2192 four 0s. Output starts with four 0s (0,0,8,0), which is three 0s. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the sequence of 0s and 3s in the input. The input has 0s at positions 3,7,9,16. 3s at positions 0,4,10,17,19. The output is [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]. Not sure how 8 comes into play here.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's output arrays, the fourth element is often a 3. For example, the first output array's fourth element is 3. The fourth output array's fourth element is 0. Not a strong pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays are constructed by taking the first occurrence of each number in the input array and then repeating them. For example, input has 3,8,0,1. Output is [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]. Maybe taking the order of first occurrences. But the input's first occurrences are 3,8,0,1. The output starts with 0s. Not matching.\n\nThis is really tough. Let's think about the Test Input. One of the input arrays is [8,0,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,2]. The longest run is of 10 3s. If the output is elements after this run, it would be [0,2]. But how to get a longer output array. Maybe this array's output would be [0,2], but in the training examples, output arrays are longer. Perhaps this array's output is combined with others.\n\nAlternatively, the Test Input has multiple arrays with runs of 3s, like the fourth and fifth arrays. Maybe the output is formed by combining elements from all arrays that have a run of a certain number, like 3s. For example, take elements after each run of 3s and concatenate them. But how?\n\nAlternatively, each output array corresponds to one input array, and the output is formed by taking the elements after the longest run in that input array, trimming or padding to a certain length. But the output arrays vary in length.\n\nExample 0's fourth input array has a run of 2s. The output for that array is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. The elements after the 2s are 1,1,0,3,0,0,3. If we take those, and then pad with elements from somewhere, but not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output arrays might be the elements that are in the same position as the maximum element in the input array. For example, if the maximum element is 8, then take elements at positions where the value is 8. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are not part of the longest run in the input array. For instance, in Example 0's fourth input array, the longest run is 10 2s. The rest of the elements are [5,3,0,8,1,1,0,3,0,0,3]. The output for this array is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Which seems to take some of those elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, take the first element, then the elements after the longest run, then some more elements. For example, take the first element (5), then the elements after the longest run (1,1,0,3), and repeat or something. But the output has 5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1. Hmm.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the first element of the input array, then the first element after the longest run, then the second element after, and so on until the output array is filled. For Example 0's fourth input array: first element is 5, then after the run, first element is 1, second is 1, third is 0, fourth is 3, etc. So output would be [5,1,1,0,3,0,0,3]. But the output is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Doesn't match.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's compare the input and output pairs more carefully.\n\nIn Example 0's first input and output:\n\nInput Array 0: [3,8,8,0,3,8,8,0,8,0,3,1,1,1,8,8,0,3,8,3,8]\n\nOutput Array 0: [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]\n\nLooking for the output elements in the input array:\n\n0 appears at positions 3,7,9,16.\n\n8 appears at positions 1,2,5,6,8,14,15,18,20.\n\n3 appears at positions 0,4,10,17,19.\n\nThe output has 0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3.\n\nSo maybe the output is taking the first four 0s, then the first four 3s. But the input has four 0s (positions 3,7,9,16). The first four 3s are at positions 0,4,10,17. But the output starts with 0,0,8,0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sequence of numbers after each 0. For example, after each 0 in the input, take the next number. Let's see:\n\nInput Array 0's 0s are at positions 3,7,9,16. The numbers after each 0 are:\n\nPosition 3: 3 (next is index 4: 3)\nPosition 7: 8 (index 8)\nPosition 9: 3 (index 10)\nPosition 16: 3 (index 17)\n\nSo the numbers after 0s are 3,8,3,3. But the output starts with 0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, take the numbers before each 0. For example, before each 0:\n\nPosition 3: previous is 8 (index 2)\nPosition 7: previous is 8 (index 6)\nPosition 9: previous is 8 (index 8)\nPosition 16: previous is 8 (index 15)\n\nSo 8,8,8,8. The output has 0,0,8,0. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: the output arrays in Example 0 have lengths that are multiples of 8. Maybe each output array is formed by taking the elements from the input array in reverse order, skipping certain elements. Let's check.\n\nInput Array 0 reversed is [8,3,8,3,0,8,8,1,1,1,3,0,8,0,8,8,3,0,8,8,3]. The output is [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]. Not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of applying a filter to the input array, like taking even numbers or odd numbers. But the output includes both even and odd numbers.\n\nAt this point, I'm not making progress. Let me look for another angle. The output arrays in Example 0 are:\n\n[0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]\n\n[1,0,0,0,3,0,3,1]\n\n[3,3,0,3,3,0,8,1]\n\n[3,3,5,1,0,3,0,0]\n\n[5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]\n\n[5,0,8,0,3,0,8,8]\n\nLooking for commonalities between these outputs. For example, the first elements are 0,1,3,3,5,5. Maybe these are the first elements of certain input arrays. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input array starts with 3. The first output array starts with 0. So that's different. Second input array starts with 3, second output array starts with 1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the first element of each output array is the last element of the corresponding input array. Example 0's first input array ends with 8. Output starts with 0. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the first element of the output is the number of times a certain number appears in the input array. For example, the first output array starts with 0, maybe the number of 0s in the input array. The first input array has four 0s, but the output starts with 0. So that's not it.\n\nAnother observation: The sixth output array in Example 0 is [5,0,8,0,3,0,8,8]. Looking at the corresponding input array (probably the sixth one in the input list):\n\nInput array 5: [8,0,0,8,2,1,0,0,0,3,0,3,1,2,0,0,0,8,0,1,0]\n\nOutput is [5,0,8,0,3,0,8,8]. Not sure how to connect these.\n\nWait, perhaps the output arrays are derived from certain rows in the input based on the presence of a specific number. For example, input arrays that contain a 2 contribute to the output. In Example 0, input arrays 3,4,5, etc., have 2s. The output has 6 arrays, and there are multiple input arrays with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array corresponds to an input array that contains a certain number, and the output is the elements from that input array after the first occurrence of that number. For example, input arrays with 2s have outputs formed by elements after the first 2. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's fourth input array has a first 2 at position 4. Elements after are 2s and then 1,1,0,3, etc. The output for this array is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. The first element of the output is 5, which is before the 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tough. Given the time I've spent and not finding a pattern, maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps the output arrays are formed by taking elements from the input arrays in a specific way, like taking the first element, then skipping some, then taking the next. For example, every fourth element starting from a certain index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are unique in some way, like the first occurrence of each number in the input array.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the sorted version of the input array, but that doesn't fit since the output arrays aren't sorted.\n\nAnother idea: The output arrays in Example 0 have elements that are the sum of adjacent pairs in the input array. For example, input array 0's first few elements are 3,8,8,0. Summing adjacent pairs: 11,16,8. Not matching the output [0,0,8,0...].\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the digits of a number formed by concatenating certain elements of the input array. For example, the first output array's elements could be formed from the digits of a larger number. But not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to discern the pattern. Given that the user expects a response in the format of the training examples, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nOne possible pattern is that each output array is formed by taking the elements that follow a run of a certain number in the input array, and the length of the output array is determined by the length of the run. For example, a run of 2s of length 10 in Example 0's fourth input array might result in taking the next 8 elements (since 10 is even, divided by 2 gives 5, but not sure). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output array length is determined by the number of different numbers in the input array. For example, if an input array has 4 unique numbers, the output has 8 elements. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll proceed to make an educated guess. Observing the Test Input, some arrays have runs of 3s (e.g., the fourth and fifth arrays). Perhaps the output arrays are formed by taking the elements after these runs. For example, the fourth input array in the Test Input is [8,0,8,3,3,...,3,0,2]. After the 10 3s, the elements are 0,2. So maybe the output for this array is [0,2]. But in the training examples, the outputs are longer. However, in Example 1's seventh input array, which has a run of 4s followed by 6,0,0,0,9, the output array is [3,3,0], which doesn't match. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output arrays are formed by taking the elements before the first occurrence of a 2 in the input array. For example, in Example 0's fourth input array, the first 2 is at position 4. Elements before are [5,3,0,8]. But the output is longer than that. \n\nGiven the time I've invested without success, I'll have to proceed with an educated guess. Based on the examples, perhaps the output arrays are formed by taking the elements after the first occurrence of a certain number (like 2,4, or 8), and taking the next n elements. For the Test Input, focusing on arrays with 3s and 8s, the output might be elements after those runs. However, without a clear pattern, I'll have to provide a guess based on the examples.\n\nGiven that in Example 0's outputs, the arrays have lengths of 8, and in the Test Input's input arrays, some have runs of 3s or 8s, perhaps the output arrays are formed by taking the elements after those runs. For example, the Test Input's fourth array has 10 3s, followed by 0,2. So the output might be [0,2]. But to match the training example format, perhaps multiple such sequences are combined. Since I'm not sure, I'll provide a sample output based on taking elements after runs of certain numbers.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the training examples and find out how the input arrays are transformed into the output arrays, then apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input has multiple arrays, and the output is a shorter array. Let's see what the output might be derived from. Let me check the first input array and the corresponding output.\n\nInput Example 0's first array: [3, 8, 8, 0, 3, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 0, 3, 8, 3, 8]\nOutput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\nHmm. Let me check if there's a common operation here. Maybe taking every nth element? The output length is 8, input is 21 elements. 21 divided by 8 is about 2.6, so maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's grouping elements. Let's see. If I split the input into groups of 3, but the output is 8 elements. Wait, 21 elements divided into groups of 3 would be 7 groups, which doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe taking the last few elements? Let's see. The input array has 21 elements, output 8. 21 minus 8 is 13, but that's not a clear pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the output arrays in Example 0: Each output array has 8 elements. Let's check if the input arrays in Example 0 have a certain structure. Each input array in Example 0 is 21 elements long. Maybe the output is constructed by taking elements from certain positions. Let's see:\n\nFor the first input array in Example 0, the output is [0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]. Let's look at the input array:\n\nOriginal input: [3, 8, 8, 0, 3, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 0, 3, 8, 3, 8]\n\nIf we look for sequences, maybe after a certain number. Wait, maybe the output is taking elements after the first occurrence of a certain number? For instance, maybe the output starts after the first 0. Let's check. The input starts with 3,8,8,0. The output starts with 0,0. Wait, the first 0 is at position 3 (0-based index 3). Then the next elements after that 0 would be 3,8,8,0,8,0,3,1... Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the elements that follow a 0 in the input. Let's check. For the first input array in Example 0, the 0s are at positions 3,7,9,14, etc. Let's see what follows each 0:\n\nAt index 3: next element is 3. But output starts with 0,0. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of times a certain digit occurs in segments. Alternatively, maybe the output is the sum or count of certain numbers in the input arrays.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input arrays are of length 16 each, and the outputs are of length 3. For instance, the first input array is [0,6,9,6,6,0,6,3,6,9,6,6,6,9,9,0], and the output is [3,3,0]. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is related to the elements between certain markers. For example, in Example 2, the input arrays have elements that include sequences like [8,8,8,8...] which might be a separator. Let's look at Example 2's first input array:\n\n[2,5,0,0,3,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,5,3,5]\n\nAnd the output is [0,0,5,3,3,3,2,2,5,0]. Wait, the input has 18 elements, output 10. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 2, some input arrays have sequences of 8s. For example, the third input array in Example 2 is [0,5,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,0,0]. The output for that example's input is [0,0,5,3,3,3,2,2,5,0]. Wait, maybe the 8s are acting as a separator, and the output is the elements between the first occurrence of 8s. Let's check. The third input array has a run of 8s starting at index 3. The elements before the 8s are 0,5,5. The elements after the 8s are 5,0,0. But the output here is [0,0,5,3,3,3,2,2,5,0] which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are not part of a consecutive run. For instance, in Example 0's first input, there are sequences like 8,8; 8,0; etc. Maybe the output is taking elements where the next element is different. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the output arrays have 3 elements each. Let's check the input arrays. For example, the first input array in Example 1 is [0,6,9,6,6,0,6,3,6,9,6,6,6,9,9,0]. The output is [3,3,0]. Wait, maybe the output is the sum or count of certain numbers. Let's see. The input array has 0s at positions 0,5,15. The 3s? There's a 3 at position 7. So sum isn't matching. Alternatively, the output could be the last three elements? The input array's last three are 9,9,0. But the output is [3,3,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is elements from the input array where their positions are determined by the value of a certain position. For example, maybe the first element of the output is the third element of the input array, etc. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother approach: let's check the length of the output arrays in relation to the input. For Example 0, each input array is 21 elements long, and the outputs are 8 elements. 21 divided by 8 is about 2.625. Maybe the output is taking every 3rd element, but 21 divided by 3 is 7. Not matching. Alternatively, the output length is 8, which is 21 minus 13. Not obvious.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input arrays, each is 21 elements. The output arrays are 6 outputs, each of 8 elements. Wait, but in the example, the output for Example 0 has 6 arrays, each of 8 elements. Wait, no. Looking back: Example 0's output is six arrays, each with 8 elements. The input has 23 arrays. Wait, maybe each output array corresponds to each input array. But in Example 0, the input lists have 23 arrays (each line in the input is an array?), but the output has 6 arrays. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the input is multiple arrays grouped together, and the output is a subset of those arrays processed. But I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the problem states that each example has an INPUT which is a list of input arrays and an OUTPUT which is a list of output arrays. For example, Example 0's INPUT is 23 arrays (each line is an array?), and the OUTPUT is 6 arrays. Similarly, Example 1's INPUT has 13 arrays and output 5. Example 2's INPUT has 17 arrays and output 8.\n\nBut the Test Input has 17 arrays, each of which is 16 elements. So the task is to process each input array into an output array following the pattern from the examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that in each input array, there's a long run of the same number (like 2,2,2,2 in some arrays in Example 0), and the output is taking the elements before and after that run. For example, in the fourth array of Example 0's input: [5,3,0,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,0,3,0,0,3], the output is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Let's see: the run of 2s is from index 4 to 13. The elements before the run are 5,3,0,8. The elements after are 1,1,0,3,0,0,3. The output is 8 elements. If the output is combining the elements before and after the run, but maybe only taking the first few and last few. The before part is 4 elements (5,3,0,8), the after part is 7 elements (1,1,0,3,0,0,3). If we take the first 4 from before and first 4 from after, but the output is 8 elements. That could fit. Let's check. The output for this input array is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Wait, the before elements are 5,3,0,8. After elements are 1,1,0,3,0,0,3. If we take the first element before (5), then the first element after (1), then second before (3) and second after (1), etc., but that would be interleaving. Let's see: 5 (before[0]), 1 (after[0]), 3 (before[1]), 1 (after[1]), 0 (before[2]), 0 (after[2]), 8 (before[3]), 3 (after[3]) \u2192 but the output is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1], which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements before the run and the elements after the run, concatenated. But the before elements are 5,3,0,8 (4 elements), after elements are 1,1,0,3,0,0,3 (7 elements). If we take the first 4 of after, then 4+4=8. So 5,3,0,8 followed by 1,1,0,3. But the output is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. No, that doesn't align. Wait, maybe the output is taking the first element before, then first after, then next before and next after. So 5,1,3,1,0,0,8,3 \u2192 which is 5,1,3,1,0,0,8,3. But the output is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe the run of 2s is replaced by a single element, and the output is the array without the run. But in this case, the original array has 21 elements. Removing the 10 2s would leave 11 elements, but the output is 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the run of a certain number (like the longest run) is considered a separator, and the output is the elements before and after. For example, in the fourth array of Example 0's input, the long run of 2s is the separator. So elements before: [5,3,0,8], elements after: [1,1,0,3,0,0,3]. The output is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Hmm, maybe taking the first element of the before and the first element of the after, alternately. So 5 (before[0]), 1 (after[0]), 3 (before[1]), 1 (after[1]), 0 (before[2]), 0 (after[2]), 8 (before[3]), 3 (after[3]). But that would give 5,1,3,1,0,0,8,3, which is not the same as the output [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother approach: let's check if the output arrays are derived from certain positions in the input arrays. For instance, in Example 0's first input array, the output is [0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]. Let's see the positions in the input array (indices 0-based):\n\nInput array: [3,8,8,0,3,8,8,0,8,0,3,1,1,1,8,8,0,3,8,3,8]\n\nLooking at the output elements:\n\n0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3.\n\nLooking at the input, the 0s are at indices 3,7,9,15. The 8s are at 1,2,5,6,8,14,15,19. Hmm.\n\nThe output starts with 0,0. Maybe the first two 0s from the input. Then 8,0: perhaps the next 8 and 0. Then 3,3,3,3: the next four 3s. Let's check:\n\nThe input array has 0s at indices 3,7,9,15. The first two are 3 and 7. Then the next 8 after 7 is at index 8 (value 8), then the 0 at 9. Then the 3s at indices 10, and then 17,18,19 (but 19 is 8), wait no. The 3s are at indices 0,10,17,19? Wait input array starts with 3, then index 10 is 3, then index 17 is 3, index 19 is 3. So three 3s. But the output has four 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are at even indices. But the input array length is 21, which is odd. Even indices would be 0,2,4... up to 20. Let's check:\n\nInput indices even: 0(3), 2(8),4(3),6(8),8(8),10(3),12(1),14(8),16(0),18(8),20(8). The elements are [3,8,3,8,8,3,1,8,0,8,8]. The output is [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the unique elements in the input array. But the input array has elements 0,1,3,8. The output has 0,8,3. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Let's look at another example. Example 1:\n\nInput arrays are of length 16. Output arrays are of length 3. Let's take the first input array of Example 1:\n\nInput: [0,6,9,6,6,0,6,3,6,9,6,6,6,9,9,0]\n\nOutput: [3,3,0]\n\nLooking at the input array, maybe the output is the elements that are unique or occur a certain number of times. For example, 3 occurs once. But output has 3,3,0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of certain groups. For example, 0+6+9=15, but output is 3. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is derived from looking at runs of the same number. For example, in Example 0's fourth input array, there's a run of 2s. The output for that array is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Let's see: the elements before the run are 5,3,0,8. The run is 2s. The elements after are 1,1,0,3,0,0,3. If the output is the first element of before (5), then the first element after (1), then the second element before (3), then the first element after (1 again?), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the first element before the run and the first elements after the run, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0, the output arrays are all 8 elements long. The inputs are 21 elements. 21-8=13. Maybe it's the last 8 elements? Let's check the first input array's last 8 elements: [8, 8, 0, 3, 8, 3, 8]. But that's 7 elements. Wait, the input array has 21 elements. Last 8 would be elements 13 to 20. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input array: positions 13-20 are [1,8,8,0,3,8,3,8]. The output is [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is formed by some kind of encoding of the input array. For example, run-length encoding. Let's check the first input array of Example 0:\n\nThe elements are: 3,8,8,0,3,8,8,0,8,0,3,1,1,1,8,8,0,3,8,3,8.\n\nRun-length encoding would be: (3,1), (8,2), (0,1), (3,1), (8,2), (0,1), (8,1), (0,1), (3,1), (1,3), (8,2), (0,1), (3,1), (8,1), (3,1), (8,1).\n\nBut the output is [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]. Not sure how that maps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the counts of certain numbers. For instance, in the first input array of Example 0, how many 0s, 8s, etc. Let's count:\n\nNumber of 0s: let's see. The input array has 0s at positions 3,7,9,15. So four 0s. 8s: multiple (positions 1,2,5,6,8,14,15,19,20). So nine 8s. 3s: positions 0,4,10,17,19. Five 3s. 1s: positions 11,12,13. Three 1s.\n\nBut the output starts with 0,0,8,0. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: looking at Example 2's third input array:\n\n[0,5,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,0,0]\n\nThe output for this is [0,0,5,3,3,3,2,2,5,0]. Hmm. The input array has a long run of 8s from index 3 to 14. The elements before are 0,5,5. The elements after are 5,0,0. So maybe the output is the elements before the run and after the run, concatenated. But before has 3 elements, after has 3. That would give 6 elements, but the output is 10. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is made by taking the elements before the run, the run's length, and the elements after. For example, the run of 12 8s. Then the output could be 0,5,5,12,5,0,0. But the output is longer. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the elements that are not part of the longest consecutive sequence. In Example 2's third input array, the longest run is 8s. So elements before and after: 0,5,5,5,0,0. But the output is longer than that.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let me think of another approach. Looking at the test input's arrays. Let's take one array from the test input and see what the output might be, based on the training examples.\n\nFor example, the fifth array in the test input is:\n\n[8, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2]\n\nLooking for a pattern here. There's a long run of 3s from index 3 to 13. So maybe the output is the elements before and after this run. Before: 8,0,8. After: 0,2. But the output needs to be 8 elements (like in Example 0's output), but the test input's output examples vary in length. Wait, no. In Example 0, the output arrays are 8 elements long. In Example 1, 3 elements. Example 2, 10 elements. So the output length varies. So perhaps the output is derived based on the input structure, like the number of elements before and after a long run.\n\nSo in this test array, the run of 3s is 11 elements (from index 3 to 13 inclusive). The elements before are [8,0,8], elements after are [0,2]. If the output is combining these, maybe taking the first two elements before and two after, but that's only 4 elements. Not enough. Alternatively, maybe the output is the elements before the run and after the run, but padded with something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the elements before the longest run concatenated with the elements after, but limited to a certain length. For instance, in the fifth test input array, before is 3 elements, after is 2. Maybe take all of them. So 8,0,8,0,2. That's 5 elements, but the output examples vary in length. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements before the longest run and the elements after, concatenated, and then truncated or padded to a certain length. But the output lengths vary, so perhaps the output is exactly the elements before and after the longest run.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's fourth input array:\n\nInput: [5,3,0,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,0,3,0,0,3]\n\nThe longest run is of 2s (10 elements). The elements before are [5,3,0,8], after are [1,1,0,3,0,0,3]. The output is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Which is 8 elements. Hmm, the elements before are 4, after are 7. So 4 + 7 = 11 elements, but output is 8. So perhaps the output is the first four elements from before and first four from after. 5,3,0,8 and 1,1,0,3. Combining gives 8 elements: 5,3,0,8,1,1,0,3. But the output is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's interleaving. Take first element from before and first from after, second from before and second from after, etc. So 5 (before[0]), 1 (after[0]), 3 (before[1]), 1 (after[1]), 0 (before[2]), 0 (after[2]), 8 (before[3]), 3 (after[3]). This would give [5,1,3,1,0,0,8,3], but the output is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the elements before the run followed by the elements after the run, but with some transformation. For example, taking the sum of consecutive pairs. But in the before elements: 5,3,0,8 \u2192 sum pairs (5+3=8, 0+8=8). After elements: 1+1=2, 0+3=3, 0+0=0, 3=3. But output is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first occurrence of each number in the input array. But in the input array, numbers are 5,3,0,8,2..., so the first occurrences are 5,3,0,8,2, but output is longer.\n\nHmm. Let's try another approach. Let's look for a common element in the input arrays that is a long run and see if the output is derived from that.\n\nIn Example 0's fourth input array, there's a long run of 2s. The output for that array is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. The elements before the run are [5,3,0,8], elements after are [1,1,0,3,0,0,3]. The output's first two elements are 5 and 1, which are the first elements of before and after. Then the next two elements are 3 and 0, which are the second elements of before (3) and after (1) \u2192 no. Wait, maybe it's taking the first element of before, then first of after, then second of before, second of after, etc. So 5 (before[0]), 1 (after[0]), 3 (before[1]), 1 (after[1]), 0 (before[2]), 0 (after[2]), 8 (before[3]), 3 (after[3]). So that would be [5,1,3,1,0,0,8,3], but the output is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Hmm, not matching. But maybe the output is taking elements before and after, but not exactly in that way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements that are not part of the longest run. For instance, in the fourth input array of Example 0, excluding the 2s, you get [5,3,0,8,1,1,0,3,0,0,3]. Which is 11 elements. But the output is 8. So maybe taking the first 8 elements of that. [5,3,0,8,1,1,0,3], which is 8 elements. But the output is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Not matching. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the elements at positions where the value changes. For example, in the first input array of Example 0: 3,8,8,0,3,8,8,0,8,0,3,1,1,1,8,8,0,3,8,3,8. The changes are at positions 0\u21921 (3\u21928), 2\u21923 (8\u21920), 3\u21924 (0\u21923), etc. But how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the differences between consecutive elements. For example, 8-3=5, 8-8=0, 0-8=-8, etc. But the output numbers are all between 0 and 8, so negative numbers might not fit.\n\nWait, in Example 0's first output array, the elements are 0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3. Let's see if these are the unique elements in the input. The input has 0,3,8,1. The output has 0,3,8. Not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the counts of specific numbers. For instance, the number of 0s, followed by 8s, then 3s, etc. In the first input array of Example 0, there are 4 zeros, 9 eights, 5 threes, 3 ones. But the output starts with 0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3. Not matching counts.\n\nHmm. Let's think of another angle. The Test Input has several arrays. Let's look at the first test input array:\n\n[0,0,0,8,1,1,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nThe output should be generated based on the pattern. Suppose there's a long run of 0s at the beginning. Let's see. The elements are [0,0,0,8,1,1,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8]. The longest run is the three 0s at the start. So elements after the run would be 8,1,1,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8. But maybe the output is taking the elements before and after the longest run. But the longest run is at the beginning, so there's no elements before. So output would be the elements after. But the output examples in training have varying lengths. For Example 0's fourth input array, the output was elements before and after the run. So perhaps the output is the elements before and after the longest run. If the longest run is in the beginning, then the elements after are taken. If the run is in the middle, elements before and after. If the run is at the end, elements before.\n\nSo in the first test input array, the longest run is three 0s. The elements after are [8,1,1,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8]. The output length varies. In Example 0's fourth array, the output length was 8, but the elements after were 7 elements. So perhaps we take the first few elements after the run. For example, the first 8 elements after the run. In this case, the after elements are 8,1,1,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8. Taking the first 8: [8,1,1,8,0,0,8,0]. So the output would be this array. But looking at Example 0's fourth input array, the after elements were 1,1,0,3,0,0,3. The output was [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. But the before elements were [5,3,0,8]. So perhaps the output is the combination of elements before and after the longest run, each truncated to 4 elements. So 4 before +4 after=8 elements. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's fourth input array:\n\nBefore run: [5,3,0,8] (4 elements)\n\nAfter run: [1,1,0,3,0,0,3]. Taking first 4 after elements: [1,1,0,3]\n\nCombined: [5,3,0,8,1,1,0,3], but the output is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nBut perhaps the output is taking the first element of before, then first of after, then second of before, second of after, etc. So for Example 0's fourth array:\n\nBefore: [5,3,0,8]\n\nAfter: [1,1,0,3,0,0,3]\n\nInterleaving first 4: 5,1,3,1,0,0,8,3 \u2192 but the output is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first four elements of the input array and the last four. Let's see for Example 0's fourth input array:\n\nFirst four: 5,3,0,8\n\nLast four: 0,0,3. Not enough, but maybe padded with something. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to find another pattern. Let's look at Example 2's first input array:\n\nInput: [2,5,0,0,3,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,5,3,5]\n\nOutput: [0,0,5,3,3,3,2,2,5,0]\n\nThe input array has elements, and the output is 10 elements. Maybe the output is the elements between the first and last occurrence of a certain number. For instance, if the first occurrence of 2 is at 0, and the last at 7. The elements between could be from 1 to 6: 5,0,0,3,0,0. But the output is longer. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the elements between two instances of 2. In the input array, 2 appears at index 0 and 7. The elements between are indexes 1-6: [5,0,0,3,0,0]. Output is [0,0,5,3,3,3,2,2,5,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Let me think of a different approach. Maybe the output is formed by grouping the input elements into pairs and summing them. For example, in Example 0's first input array:\n\n[3,8,8,0,3,8,8,0,8,0,3,1,1,1,8,8,0,3,8,3,8]\n\nGrouping into pairs:\n\n(3,8), (8,0), (3,8), (8,0), (8,0), (3,1), (1,1), (8,8), (0,3), (8,3), (8) (odd one out)\n\nSumming each pair: 11, 8, 11, 8, 8,4,2,16,3,11,8. But the output is [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the elements where their value is equal to their index modulo some number. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is the sequence of elements that are followed by a different value. For example, in the first input array of Example 0:\n\n3 is followed by 8 (different), so include 3.\n\n8 is followed by 8 (same), don't include.\n\n8 is followed by 0 (different), include 8.\n\n0 followed by 3 (different), include 0.\n\n3 followed by 8 (different), include 3.\n\n8 followed by 8 (same), don't include.\n\n8 followed by 0 (different), include 8.\n\n0 followed by 8 (different), include 0.\n\n8 followed by 0 (different), include 8.\n\n0 followed by 3 (different), include 0.\n\n3 followed by 1 (different), include 3.\n\n1 followed by 1 (same), don't include.\n\n1 followed by 1 (same), don't include.\n\n1 followed by 8 (different), include 1.\n\n8 followed by 8 (same), don't include.\n\n8 followed by 0 (different), include 8.\n\n0 followed by 3 (different), include 0.\n\n3 followed by 8 (different), include 3.\n\n8 followed by 3 (different), include 8.\n\n3 followed by 8 (different), include 3.\n\n8 (last element, maybe include).\n\nSo the sequence would be: 3,8,0,3,8,0,8,0,3,1,8,0,3,8,3,8. That's 16 elements. The output is 8 elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, taking every other element of that sequence. 3,0,8,8,3,8,3,8 \u2192 output is [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]. Not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to look for another pattern. In Example 0, the output arrays are all 8 elements. Let's see if there's a pattern in the outputs of Example 0:\n\nOutput Example 0:\n\n[0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 1]\n[3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 8, 1]\n[3, 3, 5, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n[5, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1]\n[5, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 8, 8]\n\nLooking at these outputs, they all have 8 elements. Maybe they are formed by taking the first occurrence of each digit, but I don't see a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output is the sequence of elements that are the same as the previous element. For example, in the first output array: [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]. The first 0 is followed by 0, then 8, then 0, etc. But how does this relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the first 8 elements of the input array after processing. For example, removing duplicates. But the input array's first elements are 3,8,8,0,3,8,8,0, etc. Removing consecutive duplicates would give 3,8,0,3,8,0,8,0,3,1,8,0,3,8,3,8. If we take the first 8, that's 3,8,0,3,8,0,8,0. But the output starts with 0,0. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the elements that are between two occurrences of a certain number. For example, between 0s. Let's look at the first input array of Example 0:\n\nThe 0s are at positions 3,7,9,15. The elements between 0 at 3 and 7 are 3,8,8. Between 7 and 9:8. Between 9 and 15:3,1,1,1,8,8. But the output starts with 0,0,8,0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the elements that follow a 0 in the input. For the first input array of Example 0, each time a 0 appears, take the next element. The 0s are at indices 3,7,9,15. Next elements are 3,8,0,3. But the output starts with 0,0,8,0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the elements that are before each 0. For example, before each 0 in the input array. The elements before the 0s are 8 (at index 2), 8 (index 6), 8 (index8), 8 (index14). So 8,8,8,8. But output has four 3s at the end. Not matching.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's consider that in each training example, the output arrays are formed by extracting certain elements from the input arrays. For example, in Example 2's first input array, the output is [0,0,5,3,3,3,2,2,5,0]. The input array is [2,5,0,0,3,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,5,3,5]. Let's see:\n\nLooking for the output elements in the input. The output starts with 0,0. The input has 0s at indices 2,3,5,6,8-13. The output's first two 0s could be from indices 2 and 3. Then 5: index 1. Then 3: index4. Then three 3s: but there's only one 3 at index4. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the elements of the input array but with certain transformations. For instance, adding adjacent elements. But in the first input array of Example 2, the first two elements are 2 and 5, sum 7. But output starts with 0. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is the digits of the sum of each row. But the sum of the first input array in Example 0 is 3+8+8+0+3+8+8+0+8+0+3+1+1+1+8+8+0+3+8+3+8. Let's compute that:\n\n3+8=11, +8=19, +0=19, +3=22, +8=30, +8=38, +0=38, +8=46, +0=46, +3=49, +1=50, +1=51, +1=52, +8=60, +8=68, +0=68, +3=71, +8=79, +3=82, +8=90. So sum is 90. The output is [0,0,8,0,3,3,3,3]. The digits of 90 are 9 and 0. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the sum modulo some number. 90 modulo 10 is 0. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. Let's try to think of the test input and see if I can find a pattern that fits.\n\nLooking at the fifth array in the test input:\n\n[8, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2]\n\nThis has a long run of 3s from index 3 to 13 (11 elements). The elements before are 8,0,8. The elements after are 0,2. If the output is the elements before and after the longest run, then the output would be [8,0,8,0,2]. But Example 0's fourth array had a similar situation and the output was [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1], which is longer. So maybe the output includes elements from before and after, but somehow repeated or transformed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements before and after, but each element is followed by the number of times it appears in the input array. For example, before the run:8 appears twice, 0 once. After:0 once, 2 once. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the elements before the longest run followed by the elements after, and then the length of the run. But the run length is 11. How would that fit?\n\nAlternatively, the output is the elements before and after, and the run length is inserted in between. So for the fifth test array, output would be [8,0,8,11,0,2]. But 11 isn't in the output examples, which only have digits 0-9.\n\nAlternatively, the run length modulo 10. 11 mod 10 is 1. So [8,0,8,1,0,2]. Still not matching any previous example's output.\n\nAnother approach: looking at Example 0's fourth input array's output: [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. The elements before the run of 2s are [5,3,0,8]. The elements after are [1,1,0,3,0,0,3]. The output has 8 elements. The elements before are 4 elements, after are 7. So maybe the output is the first four elements of the after array. But the after array's first four are [1,1,0,3], but the output starts with 5,1,3,0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the elements before the run concatenated with the elements after the run, and then the elements of the run are compressed into their count. But that's speculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the elements before the run, then the elements after, but each element is modified by adding the count of the run. For example, if the run is of length 10 (as in Example 0's fourth input array), then adding 10 to each element. But 5+10=15, which is not present in the output. So that's not it.\n\nThis is taking way too long and I'm not making progress. I need to make a guess based on the strongest pattern I can find.\n\nThe strongest pattern I can see is that in each input array, the output is formed by taking the elements before and after the longest run of the same number. For example, if there's a long run of 2s in Example 0's fourth input array, the output is elements before and after. The Test Input's fifth array has a long run of 3s, so the output would be the elements before ([8,0,8]) and after ([0,2]). But the output needs to be of a certain length. In Example 0's fourth array, the output was 8 elements, combining before and after. So maybe the output is the elements before and after the longest run, concatenated, and truncated or padded to a certain length. For the fifth test array, the before has 3 elements, after 2. So combining gives 5 elements. But the output examples vary in length. For instance, in Example 1's output, the arrays are 3 elements. In Example 2's output, they are 10 elements. So perhaps the length depends on the input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the elements before the longest run followed by the elements after, but only taking as many as needed to reach a certain length. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the elements that are not part of the longest consecutive run. For example, in the fifth test array, the run of 3s is 11 elements. The input has 16 elements. So the elements not in the run are 16-11=5 elements: [8,0,8,0,2]. But in Example 0's fourth input array, the run of 10 2s. The input has 21 elements. Elements not in the run:21-10=11 elements. The output for that array is 8 elements. So this doesn't directly align.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the elements before and after the longest run, each taken up to a certain number (like 4 elements each). For example, before the run: take first 4, after take first 4. If not enough, fill with something else. For the fifth test array, before has 3 elements, after has 2. So output would be 3+2=5 elements. But Example 0's fourth array had before 4, after 7. Output 8 elements. So maybe take 4 from before and 4 from after, totaling 8. For the fifth test array, before has 3 elements (8,0,8), after 2 (0,2). Then pad with something to make 4 each. Maybe the last elements of the input array. But this is speculation.\n\nBut in Example 0's fourth array, the output is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. The before elements are [5,3,0,8], after are [1,1,0,3,0,0,3]. Taking first 4 from before and first 4 from after would be [5,3,0,8,1,1,0,3], but the output is different. So this approach isn't working.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll make an educated guess based on the longest run. The output is the elements before and after the longest run, concatenated. So for each input array, find the longest consecutive run of a single number, then the output is the elements before that run followed by the elements after. If the longest run is at the beginning, output is the elements after. If it's at the end, output is the elements before. If there are multiple runs of the same maximum length, pick the first one.\n\nApplying this to the fifth test input array:\n\nInput: [8,0,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,2]\n\nLongest run is 3s (11 elements) from index 3 to 13. Elements before: [8,0,8]. Elements after: [0,2]. So output is [8,0,8,0,2]. But the training examples have outputs like in Example 0's fourth array, which had more elements. However, the output length varies, so this might be correct.\n\nBut looking at Example 0's fourth array, the elements before and after the run would be [5,3,0,8] and [1,1,0,3,0,0,3], which combined would be 4+7=11 elements. But the output is 8 elements. So this suggests that there's a maximum length for the output. Perhaps the output is the first N elements of the combined before and after. For example, N=8. So in Example 0's fourth array, the combined elements are 11, take first 8. For the fifth test array, combined is 5 elements, take all of them. So for the fifth test array, the output would be [8,0,8,0,2].\n\nBut the training examples in Example 0 have outputs that are 8 elements, even when the combined before and after is longer. So perhaps the output is always the first 8 elements of the combined before and after. If the combined length is less than 8, then it's padded with zeros or something else.\n\nBut in Example 0's fourth input array, the combined elements before and after would be 4+7=11. Take first 8: [5,3,0,8,1,1,0,3]. But the output is [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1]. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first half of before and first half of after. For example, take half of the before elements (rounded up) and half of the after elements (rounded up). For before elements of 4, take 2. After elements of 7, take 4. 2+4=6. Not 8.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent and the competition setting, I'll proceed with the assumption that the output is the elements before and after the longest run, concatenated, and then truncated to a certain length, which varies per example. For the test input arrays, I'll apply this pattern and see.\n\nFor example, the first test input array:\n\n[0,0,0,8,1,1,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8]\n\nThe longest run is the three 0s at the beginning. Elements after: [8,1,1,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8]. Output would be these elements. But how many? In Example 0's fourth array, the after elements were 7, but output was 8. So maybe pad with something. Alternatively, the output is the first 8 elements of the after part. So [8,1,1,8,0,0,8,0].\n\nBut the training examples don't show padding. For Example 0's fourth array, the after part was 7 elements. The output was [5,1,3,0,1,3,1,1], which is 8 elements. So perhaps there's a different pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the elements before the run followed by the elements after, but with each element transformed in some way, like modulo 10 or something. But I don't know.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the output is the elements before and after the longest run, concatenated, and take as many elements as needed to match the output length of the training examples for that test input. For example, the test input has 17 arrays, and the outputs in the training examples vary in length. So for each array in the test input, I'll identify the longest run, then take the elements before and after, concatenated, and present that as the output array.\n\nFor example, the fifth test input array:\n\n[8,0,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,2]\n\nLongest run of 3s. Before: [8,0,8], after: [0,2]. Output: [8,0,8,0,2].\n\nBut this is 5 elements, and the training examples have varying lengths, so this could be acceptable.\n\nAnother example: the fourth test input array:\n\n[8, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2]\n\nSame as fifth array. Output: [8,0,8,0,2].\n\nBut the fifth test array is:\n\n[1, 0, 8, 3, 2, 0, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nLongest run might be the three 1s at indices 7,8,9. So before: [1,0,8,3,2,0,8], after: [0,1,0,3,0,0]. So output would be the before and after concatenated. But this is 7 + 6 = 13 elements, but output examples vary.\n\nGiven that I can't find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with this approach and generate the outputs accordingly.",
