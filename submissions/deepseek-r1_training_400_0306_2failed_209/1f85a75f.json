        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The goal is to find the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by analyzing the training examples to understand the transformation from input to output.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input arrays, they are all length 30. The output is a list of three numbers. Let's check the first example's input and output:\n\nExample 0 Input has several arrays with elements 0, 1, 5, etc. The output is [3, 3, 0], [3,3,3], etc. Let's see if there's a connection between the input arrays and the output numbers.\n\nWait, maybe the output is derived by counting certain elements in the input arrays. Let's take the first input row in Example 0:\n\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput is [3,3,0]. Hmm. Let's think: maybe the numbers in the output represent counts of certain values. The input has 1s, 5s. Wait, the output numbers are 3,3,0. Maybe each output element is the count of a specific number in all the input arrays. Let's check.\n\nWait, Example 0's input is a list of 30 arrays (each of length 30). Wait, no\u2014wait, actually, looking back, in the problem statement, each example's input is a list of multiple arrays. For example, in Example 0, the input is a list of 20 arrays (each of length 30), and the output is a list of 5 arrays (each of length 3). Wait, no, looking at Example 0's input:\n\nThe INPUT section under Example 0 lists multiple arrays (each line is an array). Let's count them. There are 20 arrays in Example 0's input. The OUTPUT has 5 arrays. So the input is 20 arrays, each of length 30, and output is 5 arrays, each of length 3. Wait, but the problem says \"input and output pairs\", so each example's input is a list of arrays, and the output is another list of arrays. So for Example 0, the input is 20 arrays, each of length 30, and the output is 5 arrays of length 3. But how do the 20 input arrays map to the 5 output arrays? Maybe the input is split into groups, and each group is processed into an output array. Let's check how many input arrays per output array. 20 input arrays divided by 5 output arrays would be 4 input arrays per output. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0, the output has 5 arrays. So 20 input arrays / 5 output arrays = 4 input arrays per output. So perhaps each group of 4 input arrays is transformed into one output array of 3 elements. Let's check the first four input arrays of Example 0 and see if they correspond to the first output array [3,3,0].\n\nLooking at the first four input arrays:\n\n[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe output for the first group is [3,3,0]. What's common here? Let's look for patterns in these four arrays. Maybe each element in the output array corresponds to the count of a certain number across all positions in the four input arrays. For example, perhaps the first output number is the count of 3s in the input arrays. Wait, but looking at these four arrays, there are no 3s. So maybe it's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each of the four input arrays contributes to the output array. Maybe each output element is derived from certain positions in the input arrays. For instance, maybe each output array is formed by looking at three specific positions across each group of four input arrays and counting how many times a certain number appears in those positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output arrays are derived by looking at the counts of certain numbers in each column across the four input arrays. Since each input array is of length 30, perhaps each group of four input arrays is arranged as a 4x30 matrix, and the output is three numbers that represent some aggregation (like sum or count) of certain numbers in specific columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output array elements are counts of a specific number in each of the four input arrays. For example, the first output element could be the number of 1s across all four input arrays, the second the number of 5s, and the third another number. Let's check:\n\nFirst group of four input arrays:\n\nIn the first input array: 1 appears twice, 5 once.\nSecond input array: 5 once.\nThird input array: 5 once, 1 once.\nFourth input array: 5 twice, 1 once.\n\nTotal 1s: 2 + 0 +1 +1 =4? No, output is 3,3,0. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output elements are the counts of 3s, but there are no 3s in the input. So that's not it.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output arrays, the numbers are 3 and 0. The inputs have 1s, 5s, and in some arrays 3s (like the 11th input array in Example 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So in some input arrays, there are 3s. So maybe the output counts the number of times 3 appears in certain positions across the four input arrays in the group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is related to the presence of triplets. For example, in the first group of four input arrays, maybe each output element is the count of triple consecutive numbers in the input arrays. But looking at the first input array, there's a 1 followed by four 0s, then another 1, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output array corresponds to three counts: the number of times a certain number (like 1, 5, 3) appears in each of the four input arrays. But in the first group, the output is [3,3,0]. Let's see: maybe the first element counts the number of 1s across all four arrays. Let's compute:\n\nFirst array: 2 ones (positions 0 and 5)\nSecond array: 0\nThird array: 1 (position 26)\nFourth array: 1 (position 22)\nTotal 2+0+1+1=4. Not 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the count of 5s. Let's check:\n\nFirst array: 1 (position 22)\nSecond array: 1 (position 15)\nThird array: 1 (position 10)\nFourth array: two 5s (positions 8 and 15)\nTotal: 1+1+1+2=5. Not 3. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the output is [3,3,0]. So maybe the first two elements are counts of something else. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the output is based on the counts of specific numbers in specific positions. For example, perhaps each output array's elements correspond to the count of a certain number in a specific column across the four input arrays. For instance, if the output is [3,3,0], perhaps the first element is the count of 1s in position 0 across the four input arrays. Let's check:\n\nFirst array's position 0: 1\nSecond array's position 0: 0\nThird array's position 0: 0\nFourth array's position 0: 0\nTotal: 1. Not 3.\n\nHmm. Maybe a different approach. Let's look at the output arrays in Example 0. The outputs are all combinations of 3 and 0. Let's check the input arrays for the presence of 3. For example, in Example 0's input arrays, some of them have 3s. Let's look at the 11th input array in Example 0:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere, positions 17 and 18 are 3. Similarly, in other arrays like the 12th input:\n\n[5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nPositions 17, 18, 19 are 3s.\n\nSo maybe the output is related to the count of 3s in certain positions across the group of four input arrays. Let's take the first output [3,3,0]. Suppose each element in the output represents the number of times a consecutive triplet of 3s appears in the input arrays. For example, if an input array has three 3s in a row, that contributes to the output. Let's check:\n\nIn the first four input arrays of Example 0, there are no 3s. So that can't be. So that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output counts the number of times a certain number (like 5,1,3) appears in each of the four input arrays. Let's see for the first group:\n\nBut in the first group of four input arrays, 5 appears 1,1,1,2 times. So total 5. But the output is 3,3,0. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by looking at the sum of specific elements across the four input arrays. For example, each output element is the sum of a particular position across all four arrays. Let's take the first output element (3) and see if adding the first elements of the four input arrays gives 3. The first elements of the four input arrays are 1,0,0,0. Sum is 1. Not 3. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array corresponds to a certain row in the group of input arrays. For example, the first output array [3,3,0] could be derived from the first four input arrays, but how? Perhaps the 3s in the input arrays are counted in certain positions. Wait, in the 11th input array (which is part of Example 0's input), there are 3s. But the first group (arrays 0-3) don't have 3s, so how does the output get 3s?\n\nWait, perhaps the output arrays are derived from the entire input, but grouped differently. Let me check the number of input arrays and output arrays. Example 0 has 20 input arrays and 5 output arrays. 20 divided by 5 is 4, so each output array is based on 4 input arrays. Similarly, in Example 1, the input has 30 arrays and the output has 3 arrays. 30 divided by 3 is 10. Wait, that doesn't fit a consistent grouping. Hmm, maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array is derived from a single input array. But Example 0's input has 20 arrays and output 5, so 20/5=4. So each output array is based on 4 input arrays. Let's think of each output array as combining four input arrays in some way.\n\nLooking at the first output array in Example 0: [3,3,0]. Let's look at the four input arrays in the first group. Perhaps each of the output elements represents the number of times a certain pattern occurs in the four input arrays. For example, maybe the first element counts the number of times 1 appears in a certain position across the four arrays. Let's check for a specific position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the maximum value in certain positions. For example, the first element of the output is the maximum value found in position X across the four input arrays. But the output numbers are 3s and 0s, which don't appear in the first four input arrays, so that can't be.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the numbers are 3 and 0. But in the input arrays, the numbers are 0,1,5. Then, in some input arrays (like the 11th), there are 3s. So perhaps the output is derived from those input arrays that have 3s. But how does that fit into the grouping?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays are derived from the presence of 3s in the input arrays. For example, each output array corresponds to an input array that contains 3s, and the output is the count of 3s in consecutive triplets. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 11th array is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. It has two 3s. The corresponding output for that group (assuming groups of four) might be [0,3,3] (if the group includes this array and others with 3s). But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output arrays are the counts of consecutive triplets of a certain number in the entire input. But the input arrays are separate, so consecutive triplets across arrays don't make sense. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: the output arrays in Example 0 have elements that are 3 and 0. Maybe each element in the output array represents how many times a certain condition is met in the corresponding input group. For instance, each output array has three elements, which could correspond to three different conditions checked across the four input arrays.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output array is formed by taking three specific positions from each of the four input arrays and summing or counting occurrences. For example, in each group of four input arrays, select three positions (like positions 17, 18, 19) and count how many times 3 appears in those positions across all four arrays. Let's test this.\n\nTake the first group of four input arrays in Example 0. Let's check positions 17-19 in each:\n\nFirst input array: positions 17-19 are 0,0,0. No 3s.\nSecond input array: positions 17-19 are 0,0,0. No 3s.\nThird input array: positions 17-19 are 0,0,0. No 3s.\nFourth input array: positions 17-19 are 0,0,0. No 3s.\nSo that's zero 3s. But the output is [3,3,0], which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's positions where 3s appear in any of the input arrays in the group. But the first group has no 3s. So this approach isn't working.\n\nWait, maybe the output is not directly related to the numbers in the input but their indices or positions. For example, the output could be derived from the indices of non-zero elements. But this is unclear.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nExample 1's input arrays have numbers 0,2,4. The output arrays are [0,4,0], [4,4,4], [0,4,4]. The numbers in the output are 0 and 4, which might correspond to the number 4 appearing in the input. For instance, in the 10th input array of Example 1:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis array has three 4s. The corresponding output is [0,4,0], but how? Maybe the output counts the number of 4s in specific positions across the group.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the count of the number 4 in each of three specific positions across the four input arrays in a group. For example, if the group includes the 10th input array, which has 4s in positions 11,12,13, maybe the output elements sum those counts. But Example 1's output has elements up to 4, which could be the sum of 4s in a position across the group.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements are the maximum number of consecutive 4s in a particular region of the input arrays. For instance, the second output array in Example 1 is [4,4,4], which might correspond to a group where there are three consecutive 4s in three different positions.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to think of another approach.\n\nWait, the output arrays in both examples have three elements. The numbers in the output are related to the maximum value in the input arrays. In Example 0, the output elements are 3 and 0. The input arrays have 5s and 3s. In Example 1, the outputs are 4 and 0. The input arrays have 4s. So perhaps each element in the output array is the count of the maximum number present in a certain section of the input arrays.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the count of the highest number in each of three segments of the input arrays. For example, if the highest number in the input is 5 (Example 0) and 4 (Example 1), then the output counts how many times that number appears in three different regions of the input.\n\nBut in Example 0, the first output is [3,3,0], which sums to 6. If each output element is the count of 5 in a certain third of the input arrays (e.g., first ten elements, next ten, etc.), but the sum would have to be the total number of 5s. Let's check the first group of four input arrays in Example 0:\n\nFirst array: one 5 at position 22.\nSecond array: one 5 at position 15.\nThird array: one 5 at position 10.\nFourth array: two 5s at positions 8 and 15.\nTotal 5s: 5. But the output is [3,3,0], which sums to 6. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output counts the occurrences of the second-highest number. In Example 0, the numbers are 0,1,5,3. The second highest is 3. The output elements are 3 and 0. Let's check the first group of four input arrays. There are no 3s in the first four arrays. So output [3,3,0] would not make sense. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: Each output array corresponds to the count of triplets of a certain number in the input arrays. For instance, in Example 0, the output might count how many times three 5s appear in consecutive positions, but the input doesn't have that. Or how many times three 3s appear.\n\nLooking at the 11th input array in Example 0: positions 17,18 are 3s. That's two in a row, not three. The 12th input array has three 3s in positions 17-19. So in that array, there's a triplet of 3s. The output for the group containing this array would then have a count of 1 for that triplet. But in Example 0's output, there's [3,3,3], which would suggest three triplets, but perhaps each of the three elements in the output represents a different triplet (like first three positions, middle, last), but this is speculative.\n\nAnother angle: The output arrays have three elements. Maybe each element represents the count of a specific number in all the input arrays grouped into three sections. For example, the first element counts the number of 1s in the first ten elements of all input arrays in the group, the second counts 5s in the next ten, and the third counts 3s in the last ten. Let's check.\n\nFirst group of four input arrays in Example 0:\n\nFirst array:\n1s at positions 0,5 \u2192 count of 1s in first ten elements (positions 0-9): 2.\n5 at position 22 (third ten, positions 20-29). So third element would count 3s in positions 20-29. But there's a 5 here, not a 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output element is the count of a certain number in a specific third of each input array. For example, first third (positions 0-9), second (10-19), third (20-29). Let's see:\n\nFirst output array [3,3,0]. For the first group of four arrays:\n\nCount of 1s in first third (0-9) across all four arrays:\nArray1: positions 0 and 5 \u2192 2.\nArray2: none.\nArray3: none.\nArray4: none.\nTotal: 2. Not 3.\n\nCount of 5s in second third (10-19) across four arrays:\nArray1: no 5s in 10-19.\nArray2: position 15 \u2192 1.\nArray3: position 10 \u2192 1.\nArray4: positions 15 \u21921 and 8 (which is in first third) \u2192 no.\nTotal: 1+1+1=3. So second element is 3.\n\nThird third (20-29): 5s in array1 (position22), array2 (none), array3 (none), array4 (position22). So total 2. But output third element is 0. So this doesn't align.\n\nHmm. This approach seems inconsistent. Maybe the numbers being counted are different. Like, for Example 0, the output elements count 3s in each third.\n\nIn the first group of four arrays, there are no 3s. So the output would be [0,0,0], but the actual output is [3,3,0]. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output counts the number of input arrays in the group that have a certain feature. For example, each output element represents how many of the four input arrays have a particular characteristic. For instance, first element could be the number of arrays with at least one 1, the second with at least one 5, third with at least one 3. Let's check the first group:\n\nFirst array: has 1s and 5 \u2192 counts for elements 1 and 2.\nSecond array: has 5 \u2192 counts for element 2.\nThird array: has 5 and 1 \u2192 elements 1 and 2.\nFourth array: has 5 and 1 \u2192 elements 1 and 2.\nSo in the four arrays, how many have 1s: arrays 1,3,4 \u2192 3. How many have 5s: all four \u21924. How many have 3s: none. So output would be [3,4,0], but the actual output is [3,3,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nBut maybe it's the number of arrays that have exactly two instances of a certain number. For example, first element is the number of arrays with exactly two 1s, etc. Let's see:\n\nFirst array: two 1s \u2192 counts for element 1.\nSecond array: no 1s.\nThird array: one 1.\nFourth array: one 1.\nSo total for element 1: 1. Not 3.\n\nThis isn't working.\n\nAnother idea: The output elements are derived from summing certain numbers in the input arrays. For example, the first output element is the sum of all 1s in the group, the second the sum of 5s, third sum of 3s. For the first group:\n\n1s: 2+0+1+1=4.\n5s:1+1+1+2=5.\n3s:0.\nOutput would be [4,5,0], but actual output is [3,3,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're multiplied. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output arrays are formed by looking at three specific positions in each of the four input arrays and counting how many times a certain number appears. For example, for the first output array [3,3,0], perhaps in position X of the four input arrays, the number Y appears Z times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output elements are the counts of the numbers 3, 3, and 0 in a specific part of the input. But that's circular.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the result of applying a certain mathematical operation to the sum of each third of the input arrays. For example, sum the first ten elements, next ten, and last ten of each input array, then take modulo or something. Let's try this for the first input array of Example 0:\n\nFirst array sum of first ten elements (0-9): 1+0+0+0+0+1+0+0+0+0 = 2.\nSecond ten (10-19): all zeros except position 22 is in third ten.\nThird ten (20-29): 5 at position 22, others 0 \u2192 sum 5.\nBut the output is [3,3,0]. Not sure.\n\nThis approach isn't leading anywhere. Let's think differently. The output arrays in the training examples have elements that are all the same or a combination of the highest number in the input. For example, in Example 1, the outputs include 4, which is the highest number in the input (since there's 4 and 2). So maybe each element in the output array corresponds to the count of the highest number in a certain segment of the input arrays.\n\nIn Example 0, the highest number is 5, but the output elements are 3. So that doesn't fit. Wait, but in Example 0's input arrays, there are also 3s. Maybe the highest number in some of the input arrays is 5, and others have 3. So perhaps the output is related to the count of the maximum number in each group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output elements are the count of the number that appears most frequently in each of three segments of the input arrays. For example, split each input array into three parts (0-9, 10-19, 20-29), then for each part across the group, find the most frequent number and count how many times it appears.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's take the first group of four input arrays in Example 0 and split each into three segments.\n\nFor each of the four arrays:\n\nFirst array:\n0-9: [1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 numbers are 1 (twice), rest 0. Most frequent is 0, appearing 8 times. But how does this relate to the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each segment, count the occurrences of a certain number. For example, in the first segment (0-9) across all four arrays, count how many 1s are there. In the second segment (10-19), count how many 5s. In the third segment (20-29), count how many 3s.\n\nFirst segment (0-9) in the four arrays:\n\nArray1: two 1s.\nArray2: no 1s.\nArray3: no 1s.\nArray4: one 1 (position 8? Wait, array4's first ten elements are [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0], so 5 at position 8. So no 1s in first segment of array4.\nSo total 1s in first segment across four arrays: 2. But output first element is 3.\n\nNot matching. Let's try another approach. Perhaps the output arrays are based on the positions of certain numbers in the input arrays. For example, the first element of the output could be the number of input arrays in the group where the number 1 appears before position 10, the second element the number of arrays where 5 appears before position 20, etc. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output arrays are formed by looking for triplets of the same number in the input arrays. For example, if three consecutive elements in an input array are the same, that contributes to the output. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's first input array, there are sequences of zeros but no triplets of the same non-zero number. Similarly, in arrays with 3s, like the 11th array, there are two 3s in a row but not three. The 12th array has three 3s in a row (positions 17-19). So the output for the group containing this array would have [3,3,3], indicating three triplets. But how does that map to the output?\n\nAlternatively, each output element represents whether a triplet exists in a certain part of the input arrays. For example, the first element is 3 if there's a triplet in the first third, etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet's try to find another pattern. Looking at Example 0's output arrays:\n\n[3,3,0], [3,3,3], [3,0,3], [3,3,3], [0,3,3]\n\nThese all have 3s and 0s. The numbers 3 might indicate that three of the four input arrays in the group have a certain property. For example, each output element could correspond to the number of arrays in the group that have a specific number in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be a ternary representation, but that's unlikely.\n\nLet me look at the test input to see if there's a pattern there. The test input has arrays with numbers 0,1,3,8, etc. For example, the first test input array is [0,0,1,0,3,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The numbers here are 1,3,8. The output would likely involve counts of these numbers, perhaps in specific positions.\n\nWait, in the training examples, the output numbers seem to correspond to the highest number in the input divided by some factor. For example, in Example 0, the highest number is 5, but the output is 3. In Example 1, the highest is 4, and the output is 4. So maybe the output elements are the highest number minus 2? 5-2=3, 4-0=4. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the number of times the highest number in the input appears in each of three segments of the input arrays. For Example 0, the highest number is 5. Let's take the first group of four input arrays and count how many times 5 appears in each third:\n\nFirst third (0-9):\nArray1: no 5s.\nArray2: no.\nArray3: no.\nArray4: position8 \u2192 5.\nTotal:1.\n\nSecond third (10-19):\nArray1: no.\nArray2: position15 \u21925.\nArray3: position10 \u21925.\nArray4: position15\u21925.\nTotal:3.\n\nThird third (20-29):\nArray1: position22\u21925.\nArray2: no.\nArray3: no.\nArray4: position22\u21921 (not 5).\nTotal:1.\n\nSo output would be [1,3,1], but the actual output is [3,3,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the count of a specific number in three different regions of the input group. For Example 0's output [3,3,0], perhaps the first two elements count the number of 5s in two different regions, and the third counts 3s. Let's see:\n\nFirst group:\n\n5s in positions 0-9: array4 has one 5 (position8).\n5s in positions 10-19: array2 (15), array3 (10), array4 (15) \u2192 total 3.\n3s: none.\nSo output would be [1,3,0], but the actual is [3,3,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. This is getting frustrating. Let's think outside the box. Perhaps the output arrays are formed by looking at the indices where certain numbers appear and then applying a mathematical operation. For example, sum the indices where 5 appears and take modulo 3. But I don't see how that would lead to the outputs given.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be related to the number of times a certain number appears in the entire group, modulo some number. For instance, if there are 5 instances of 5 in a group, 5 mod 3 is 2, but the output has 3s.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be derived from the number of times a certain pattern appears. For example, if the input arrays have a 1 followed by a 5 in consecutive positions, that could contribute to the output. But checking the first group:\n\nArray1: 1 at position0, then zeros. No such pattern.\n\nAnother approach: Since the output arrays have three elements, perhaps they are derived from three different features of the input group. For example, first element is the count of 1s, second count of 5s, third count of 3s in the entire group. Let's check:\n\nFirst group of Example0:\n\n1s: 2 (array1) +0 (array2) +1 (array3) +1 (array4) =4.\n5s:1+1+1+2=5.\n3s:0.\nOutput is [3,3,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nBut maybe it's the count modulo something. 4 mod 4 is 0, 5 mod 4 is 1. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output elements are the counts of the numbers 1,5,3 in the entire group, but divided by some number. 4/1=4, 5/1=5, but output is 3. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: The output elements are the number of input arrays in the group that have a certain number in any position. For example, first element is how many arrays in the group have a 1, second how many have a 5, third how many have a 3.\n\nFirst group of Example0:\n\nNumber of arrays with 1: array1, array3, array4 \u21923.\nNumber with 5: array1, array2, array3, array4 \u21924.\nNumber with 3: 0.\nSo output would be [3,4,0], but actual output is [3,3,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nBut perhaps the second element counts how many arrays have at least two 5s. In the first group, only array4 has two 5s. So output would be [3,1,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output elements are the counts of certain numbers in specific positions across the group. For example, the first element is the count of 1s in position 0, the second count of 5s in position 15, and the third count of 3s in position 17. Let's check:\n\nFirst element (1s in position0):\narray1:1.\narray2:0.\narray3:0.\narray4:0.\nTotal:1. Output element is 3. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's try to think of another angle. The outputs in Example 0 are all 3s and 0s, which are the same as the numbers present in some input arrays. So perhaps the output arrays are related to the 3s in the input. But how?\n\nLooking at Example0's output arrays:\n\n[3,3,0], [3,3,3], [3,0,3], [3,3,3], [0,3,3]\n\nThese could represent how the 3s are arranged in the corresponding group of input arrays. For instance, each output element corresponds to the number of 3s in a certain part of the input group.\n\nLet's take the second output array [3,3,3]. This would suggest that in the corresponding group of four input arrays, each of the three parts (e.g., thirds) has three 3s. Looking for such a group in Example0's input:\n\nThe 12th input array in Example0 is [5,0,5,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]. This array has three 3s in positions 17-19. Suppose this array is part of a group that also has other arrays with 3s in other thirds. But this requires more detailed analysis.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays might represent the presence of 3s in certain columns across the group. For example, each output element corresponds to a column, and the value is 3 if there are three 3s in that column across the four input arrays. Let's consider the 12th input array which has three 3s in columns 17, 18, 19. If other arrays in the group also have 3s in these columns, the output could be [3,3,3] if each column has three 3s across the four arrays. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be a code based on the positions of 3s. For example, if in a group of four input arrays, the 3s are in certain positions, the output is derived from those positions. But without more examples, it's hard to discern.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern in the test input and see if I can find a clue.\n\nThe test input has numbers 0,1,3,8, and some 2s. The output will likely involve these numbers. For example, the output could be counts of 8s in certain regions, or combinations of numbers.\n\nAlternatively, considering the training examples, the output arrays have elements that are the same as the highest number minus 2 (Example0's highest is 5, output is 3; Example1's highest is 4, output is 4). But that doesn't fit for Example1.\n\nWait, in Example1's input, the highest number is 4. The output arrays have 4 and 0. So perhaps each output element is the count of 4s in a certain region. Let's check the first output array in Example1: [0,4,0]. If the corresponding group of input arrays has four 4s in the middle third, for example.\n\nLooking at the 10th input array in Example1:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis array has three 4s in positions 11-13. If this array is part of a group, and the output [0,4,0] corresponds to the count of 4s in the first, second, and third thirds. The 4s here are in the second third (positions 10-19: positions 11-13 are in the second third). So count of 4s in second third is 3, but output element is 4. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output counts the number of input arrays in the group that have a 4 in any position. For example, if the group has four arrays with 4s, then the output element would be 4. But in Example1's output [4,4,4], maybe all three elements are 4, indicating that in each of three segments, there are four 4s. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven that I'm not making progress, perhaps I should consider that each output array is formed by looking at three consecutive elements in the input arrays and counting the maximum value in those positions. For example, in each group of four input arrays, look at three consecutive positions, take the maximum value from each input array, and sum them. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output arrays are derived from the sum of the first three numbers, middle three, and last three of each input array in the group. But with four input arrays, this would require summing 12 numbers per segment, which doesn't align with the output numbers.\n\nAnother idea: The output arrays are formed by counting how many times a certain number appears in each of three specific columns across the group. For example, column 5, 10, and 15. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0's first group, the output is [3,3,0]. If we look at column 5 across the four arrays:\n\nArray1: position5 is 1.\nArray2: position5 is 0.\nArray3: position5 is 0.\nArray4: position5 is 0.\nSo count of 1s in column5: 1. Not 3.\n\nNot matching. Another column.\n\nAlternatively, columns 17, 18, 19. For the group that includes the 11th and 12th input arrays in Example0:\n\nThe 11th array has 3s in 17 and 18.\nThe 12th array has 3s in 17-19.\nOther arrays in the group may have 3s in these columns. So the output for that group would count the total 3s in these columns across the four input arrays. For example, if each column has 3s in three of the four arrays, the output would be [3,3,3].\n\nThis could be possible. Let's check:\n\nFor the output [3,3,3], the corresponding group would have four input arrays where each of the three columns (say 17, 18, 19) has 3s in three of the arrays. For example:\n\nArray1: 17,18,19 \u2192 3,3,3.\nArray2: 17,18,19 \u21923,3,3.\nArray3: 17,18,19 \u21923,3,3.\nArray4: 17,18,19 \u21920,0,0.\nThen, the count would be 3 in each column (three arrays have 3s). So output would be [3,3,3].\n\nThis matches the output. But I need to check if this is the case.\n\nLooking at Example0's input, the 12th array has 3s in 17-19. The 11th array has 3s in 17 and 18. Let's see if there's a group where three of the four arrays have 3s in columns 17, 18, 19. But without knowing the exact grouping, it's hard to say.\n\nAssuming the output arrays are generated by counting the number of 3s in three specific columns across four input arrays, then the output elements would be those counts. This could explain the [3,3,3] output if each column has three 3s.\n\nApplying this pattern to the test input: Look for three columns where the numbers 8 or 3 are frequent. The output would then be the counts of those numbers in those columns across groups of input arrays.\n\nBut the test input has numbers like 8 and 3. For example, looking at the first test input array:\n\n[0,0,1,0,3,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nPositions with numbers are 2 (1),4 (3),6 (8),19 (3),21 (8).\n\nAssuming the output is formed by selecting three columns (like positions 6, 19, 21) and counting the number of 8s,3s in each across the group. For example, if in a group of four input arrays, column6 has 8 appearing three times, column19 has 3 appearing three times, and column21 has 8 appearing three times, the output would be [3,3,3].\n\nBut without knowing the exact columns and groupings, it's challenging to generate the correct output. However, given the time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the training examples.\n\nIn both training examples, the output elements are the maximum number in the input or close to it. For Example0, the output is 3 (max input 5), and for Example1, output is 4 (max input 4). So perhaps each output element is the count of the maximum number in the input across three different segments.\n\nFor the test input, the maximum number is 8. So the output elements might be counts of 8s in three different segments of the input arrays. For example, each output element is the number of 8s in a third of the group of input arrays.\n\nHowever, since the test input has multiple arrays, I need to group them into sets of four (like Example0) or other sizes. For Example0, 20 input arrays become 5 outputs (4 per group). The test input has 30 arrays, which would become 30/4=7.5, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the test input might be grouped into 10 arrays per output (as in Example1's input of 30 arrays leading to 3 outputs). But this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output array corresponds to a single input array, and the elements are derived from three specific positions in that input array. For example, positions 5, 10, 15. But in the test input, this would mean 30 output arrays, but the test input has 30 arrays and the output format isn't clear.\n\nGiven the confusion and time constraints, I'll hazard a guess that the output is derived by counting the occurrences of the highest number in each of three segments of the input arrays. For the test input, the highest number is 8. So each output element counts how many 8s are in each third of the group of input arrays.\n\nFor example, in a group of four input arrays from the test input, count the number of 8s in the first ten elements (0-9), next ten (10-19), and last ten (20-29). The sum of 8s in each third would form the output array.\n\nLooking at the first few test input arrays:\n\nFirst array: positions6 and21 have 8.\nSecond array: positions2,8,17,28,29.\nThird array: positions20-22: 8,8,8.\nFourth array: positions2,8,15,29.\nEtc.\n\nIf each output array is derived from four input arrays, then summing 8s in each third:\n\nBut this is speculative. Another approach: Since the training examples' outputs are based on counts of 3 and 4, which are one less than the highest numbers in the input (5 and 4), perhaps the output is the highest number minus 2. For Example0, 5-2=3; Example1, 4-0=4. But this doesn't fit well. Alternatively, the output is the count of the highest number minus 2. But in Example0's first group, highest is 5, count of 5 is 5, 5-2=3. Which matches the output [3,3,0]. Maybe each output element is the count of the highest number in the group minus 2. But in Example1's first output [0,4,0], the highest is 4. Count of 4s in the group is, say, 4, 4-0=4. But the output has 4, which matches.\n\nSo perhaps the output elements are the count of the highest number in the group, but divided into three segments. For example, for each third of the input group, count the highest number's occurrences, then subtract 2 (or another value).\n\nFor the test input, the highest number is 8. So the output elements would be the count of 8s in each third minus something. But without knowing the exact transformation, it's hard. But given the training examples, let's assume each output element is the count of the highest number in each third of the group. For example, the first element is the count of 8s in the first third (0-9) of the group's arrays, the second in the middle third (10-19), and third in the last third (20-29).\n\nLet's take the first four test input arrays and count 8s in each third:\n\nFirst array:\n0-9: position6 \u2192 8.\n10-19: position19 \u21923.\n20-29: position21 \u21928.\nTotal 8s in first third:1, middle:0, last:1.\n\nSecond array:\n0-9: position2 \u21928.\n10-19: positions17,20,21 \u21928,8.\n20-29: position28 \u21920, 29 \u21920.\nSo first third:1, middle:2 (positions17 and 20?), wait, positions10-19: 17 is in 10-19. So second array's middle third has 8 at position17.\n\nThird array:\n20-22:8,8,8. So last third:3.\n\nFourth array:\n0-9: position2 \u21928.\n10-19: position15 \u21928.\n20-29: position29 \u21928.\n\nSo for the first four arrays:\n\nFirst third (0-9) 8 counts: array1 has 1, array2 has1, array3 has0, array4 has1. Total:3.\nMiddle third (10-19): array1 has0, array2 has1 (position17), array3 has0 (since 20 is beyond 19), array4 has1 (position15). Total:2.\nLast third (20-29): array1 has1, array2 has0, array3 has3, array4 has1. Total:5.\n\nSo the output for this group would be [3,2,5]. But the training examples have outputs like [3,3,3]. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output array is formed by taking the maximum count of the highest number in each third across the group. For example, in the first third, how many arrays have at least one 8. If three arrays have 8 in the first third, the output element is 3.\n\nFirst four test arrays:\n\nFirst third (0-9) 8s: arrays1,2,4 \u21923 arrays.\nMiddle third (10-19): arrays2,4 \u21922.\nLast third: arrays1,3,4 \u21923.\nSo output [3,2,3]. But training examples have 3s and 0s, so this might not fit.\n\nGiven that I'm not making progress, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the training examples. Since the output arrays in the training examples seem to count the number of times the second-highest number appears in certain regions, or the highest number minus a certain value, I'll assume that for the test input, the output arrays are formed by counting the number of 8s in three specific columns across groups of input arrays. For example, columns 6, 21, and another where 8s are common.\n\nLooking at the first test input array, there's an 8 at position6 and 21. The third array has 8s at 20-22. The seventh array has 8s at 22,26,27. If the output is formed by counting 8s in specific columns, like positions6,21, and another, the output might be [3,3,0], [3,3,3], etc.\n\nBut without knowing the exact columns, this is a shot in the dark. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nThe output arrays are formed by counting the occurrences of the highest number in three specific columns across each group of input arrays. For the test input, the highest number is 8. The output elements are the counts of 8s in three specific columns (like positions6, 20, and 21) across each group of four input arrays.\n\nBased on this, the final output might look something like:\n\n[3,3,3]\n[3,3,3]\n[3,3,0]\n etc.\n\nBut considering the training examples, the outputs have varying combinations of the highest number and zeros. Given the uncertainty, I'll provide an output similar to the training examples but adjusted for the test input's highest number, which is 8. However, since the training examples' outputs were based on lower numbers, maybe the test output uses a different pattern. \n\nAlternatively, the output might be counting the number of times the highest number appears in three different regions, possibly modulo 3. For example, 8 mod 5 is 3, so the output elements would be 3. But this is a stretch.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to conform to the format, I'll provide a best-guess answer based on the patterns observed.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out this puzzle. So, the task is to find the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples, and then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nLooking at the first example (Example 0), the input is a list of 30 elements each, and the output is a list of 3 elements. Similarly, Example 1 has input lists of 30 elements and outputs of 3 elements. So, the output is somehow derived from the input lists by condensing them into three numbers.\n\nLet me look at the details. In Example 0's input, there are multiple lists. The output is [3,3,0], [3,3,3], etc. Let me check if there's a common element in the input lists that leads to these outputs.\n\nWait, maybe each of the output numbers corresponds to a certain part of the input list. Since the input lists are 30 elements long, perhaps they are divided into three groups of 10 elements each. Then, maybe each output number is the count of a specific value in each group.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input list:\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIf we split this into three parts of 10 elements each:\nFirst 10: [1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] \u2192 count of 1s here is 2, but the output is 3. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number 5? Or another value. Let me check another example. Take the first output in Example 0: [3,3,0]. Let's look at the input lists. The first input list has a 1, then a 1, and a 5. But how does that lead to 3,3,0?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the occurrence of certain numbers in specific positions. For example, maybe the sum or count of a particular number in each third of the list.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input list again. Let's see the numbers present. There's 1 and 5. The output is [3,3,0]. Maybe the output counts the number of times a specific number appears in each third. For example, the first third (positions 0-9), second third (10-19), third third (20-29). Let's check:\n\nFirst third (0-9): 1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0 \u2192 count of 1s is 2. But the output first element is 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of a specific number, but the target number changes based on the example. For example, in Example 0, the outputs have 3s and 0s. Maybe the number being counted is 5 or 1. Let's check.\n\nIn the first input list of Example 0, the 5 is at position 22 (third third). The output is [3,3,0]. Hmm. If the third third has a 5, but the output third element is 0. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output numbers are the count of a certain digit in each of the three sections. Let's look at another example. Take Example 0's second input list:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSplit into thirds:\n0-9: all 0s except maybe position 15? Wait, positions 0-9 are the first 10 elements. Wait, the list has 30 elements, so 0-9, 10-19, 20-29.\n\nIn this second input list, the 5 is at position 15, which is in the second third (10-19). The output here is [3,3,3]. That's confusing. If the count of 5s in each third, but there's only one 5 here. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is related to the presence of certain numbers, like the maximum value in each third. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's first input list:\n\nFirst third (0-9): max is 1.\n\nSecond third (10-19): all 0s.\n\nThird third (20-29): max is 5.\n\nBut output is [3,3,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe it's something else. Let's check the second example (Example 1). The output is [0,4,0], [4,4,4], etc. The numbers 4 appear here. Looking at the inputs for Example 1, there are 2s and 4s. For example, in one of the input lists:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSplit into thirds:\n\nThird 10-19: 0s, third 20-29: 2. But the output here is [0,4,4]. Wait, the 4s are in positions 11-13 (so second third, 10-19). So the second third has three 4s, but the output's second element is 4. Maybe it's counting the number of 4s in each third. That could be. Let's check other examples.\n\nAnother input in Example 1:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSplit into thirds:\n\n0-9: 0s except a 2 at position 3 (first third). Second third (10-19): positions 10-19 have 4,4 at 12 and 13. Third third (20-29): 0s. So if we're counting 4s, the first third has 0, second has 2, third has 0. But the output here is [0,4,4], which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output counts the number of times a certain number appears in each third. For Example 0, maybe the number is 5 and 1. Let's check the first example's outputs. The output is [3,3,0], but in the first input list of Example 0, there are two 1s and one 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of a certain digit in each third. For instance, in Example 0, perhaps summing the 1s and 5s. Let's see:\n\nFirst input list in Example 0:\n\nFirst third (0-9): two 1s \u2192 sum 2.\n\nSecond third (10-19): all 0s.\n\nThird third (20-29): one 5 \u2192 sum 5.\n\nBut the output is [3,3,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of a certain pattern, like consecutive numbers. For example, in Example 1, the input has 4s grouped in threes, which could relate to the output 4s.\n\nWait, in Example 1's first input list, the output is [0,4,0]. The input has 2s and a 4 in the third part. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the presence of certain triplets. For example, in the input lists, when there's a triplet of the same number, that's counted in the output. But in Example 0's first input list, there's a 5 in position 22, but no triplets. The output is [3,3,0]. So that might not fit.\n\nAnother angle: the output lists have three elements, each possibly corresponding to a row or column in a 2D grid. But the input is a 1D list. Maybe the input represents a 2D structure. For example, 30 elements could be 5x6 grid, but not sure.\n\nWait, the input lists in the training examples have 30 elements each. The outputs have 3 elements. So maybe the input is split into 3 sections of 10 elements each, and each section is processed into one output element.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input:\n\nFirst 10 elements: [1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. The output's first element is 3. What's special here? Maybe counting the number of 1s and 5s. There are two 1s. 3 is not matching. Alternatively, sum of elements: 1+0+0+0+0+1=2. Still not 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of certain numbers in the section. Let's check the output in Example 0's first input: [3,3,0]. The third section has a 5. So maybe 3 represents the count of 5s? No, in the first section there are no 5s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output elements are the maximum number in each section. For Example 0's first input, first section max is 1, second is 0, third is 5. But output is [3,3,0]. So not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers in the output are related to the count of a specific digit. For example, in Example 0, the outputs are 3 and 0. Maybe 3 represents the count of 5s in each section. Let's check:\n\nFirst input in Example 0's first input list: third section (20-29) has a 5. So third element would be 1. But the output is [3,3,0]. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the count of a certain digit plus another. For example, in Example 0, maybe 1s and 5s are summed. Let's see:\n\nFirst section: two 1s \u2192 2. Second section: 0. Third section: one 5 \u2192 1. But output is 3,3,0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are the count of pairs of a certain number. For instance, in the first section of Example 0's first input, there are two 1s. But 2 doesn't become 3.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me look at Example 1's output. The outputs are 0,4,4 etc. In Example 1's input, there are 4s in some sections. For example, in the input list corresponding to output [0,4,0], the input has 4s in the second third. Let's see:\n\nFirst input list in Example 1:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSplit into thirds:\n\n0-9: all 0s.\n\n10-19: two 2s.\n\n20-29: one 2.\n\nSo the output is [0,4,0]. Hmm, not sure how that maps. But 4 is in the output. Wait, in another input list of Example 1, there's a part with 4,4,4. For example:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe second third (10-19) has three 4s. The output for this input is [0,4,4]. So the second element is 4, maybe because there are three 4s (but why 4 then?). Alternatively, the maximum value in that section is 4, which is mapped to the output. So maybe each output element is the maximum value in each third of the input list.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n\nFor Example 0's first input list:\n\nFirst third: max is 1 \u2192 output first element would be 1, but the output is 3. So that's not matching.\n\nFor Example 1's first input list:\n\nSecond third has max 2, third third has max 2. Output is [0,4,0], which doesn't match. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of each third modulo some number. For Example 0's first input:\n\nFirst third sum 2 \u2192 2 mod something? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for the output numbers in the input lists. In Example 0's first output [3,3,0], the numbers 3 and 0. Are there any 3s in the input lists? Looking at Example 0's inputs, in the 11th input list (the one with 3s):\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but how does that relate to the output? Maybe the output is derived from the count of a certain number, but the number changes per example. For instance, in Example 0, the outputs are 3s and 0s, and the input lists contain 3s in some of their elements. But in the first input list of Example 0, there are no 3s. So that might not be it.\n\nWait, maybe the output elements are derived from the number of times a certain digit appears in the entire input matrix. For example, in Example 0, the output lists have 3s, which could be the count of 5s or 1s. But the first input list has two 1s and one 5. The output is [3,3,0], which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is encoding the positions where certain numbers are found. For example, in the first output of Example 0, [3,3,0], maybe the 3s indicate that in the first two sections, there are 3 instances of a certain number. But again, not sure.\n\nLet me look at the test input. The test input has numbers like 1, 3, 8, etc. For example, one of the test input lists is:\n\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSplit into thirds (0-9, 10-19, 20-29):\n\n0-9: [0,0,1,0,3,0,8,0,0,0] \u2192 numbers present: 1,3,8.\n\n10-19: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,8] \u2192 numbers: 3,8.\n\n20-29: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 all zeros.\n\nBut how would this translate into an output? The output for the test would be three elements, each possibly based on each third.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the outputs in Example 0 are 3s and 0s, and in Example 1 are 4s and 0s. So maybe the output number is the highest digit present in each third. For example, in Example 1's first input list, the third third (20-29) has a 2, so the output third element is 0. Hmm, but 2 is higher than 0, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the output is the count of the highest digit in each third.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of a certain digit in each third. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4. If the input has 4s in a third, maybe the output is 4. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1's first input list, the output is [0,4,0]. The input's second third (10-19) has 2s. But there's an input list in Example 1 where the second third has three 4s, and the output for that is [0,4,4]. So maybe the output is the maximum value in each third. For example:\n\nFirst third: max is 0 \u2192 output 0.\n\nSecond third: max is 4 \u2192 output 4.\n\nThird third: max is 2 \u2192 output 4? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, the output here is [0,4,4]. The third third has a max of 2, but output is 4. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the count of the digit that appears most frequently in each third. For instance, in Example 1's input where there are three 4s in the second third, the count is 3, but the output is 4. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output numbers correspond to the digits that form a contiguous block of three in the input list. For example, in Example 0's inputs, maybe there are three 5s or 1s in a row, and the output counts that. But looking at the first input list of Example 0, there's a 5 alone, so that doesn't explain the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number of clusters of a certain digit in each third. But again, not sure.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's consider that each output list corresponds to multiple input lists. For example, in Example 0's output, there are 5 output lists, each with 3 elements. The input has 30 lists. Wait, no. Looking back, the input for each example is a list of lists. For Example 0, the input is a list of 30 lists (each of length 30?), and the output is a list of 5 lists. Wait, no, in the problem statement, each example's input is a list of lists, and the output is a single list. Wait, looking at Example 0:\n\nINPUT: \n\nA list of 30 lists (each of 30 elements) followed by OUTPUT: a list of 5 lists (each of 3 elements). Wait, but the problem statement says each example is an input and output pair. So each example's input is a list of lists (probably 30 lists each of 30 elements?), and the output is a list of lists. For example, Example 0's input has 30 rows (each 30 elements?), and the output is 5 rows of 3 elements each.\n\nBut the user's formatting may not be clear. Let me recheck.\n\nIn Example 0, the INPUT is a list of multiple lists. For instance, the first input list is:\n\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThen there are 30 such lists in the input? Because in the problem statement, the user says \"Below is a list of input and output pairs with a pattern. Your goal is to identify the pattern or transformation in the training examples that maps the input to the output.\"\n\nWait, perhaps each example's input is a list of lists (each of length 30), and the output is a list of lists (each of length 3). So for Example 0, there are 30 input lists, and 5 output lists. But how?\n\nAlternatively, each example's input is a list of several lines (maybe each line is a list of 30 elements), and the output is a list of several lines (each line is a list of 3 elements). For example, Example 0's input has 30 lines, and the output has 5 lines.\n\nBut this is unclear. The formatting in the user's message is a bit confusing. Let me try to re-examine the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nThere are multiple lines, each enclosed in square brackets, separated by line breaks. The input for Example 0 has 30 lists (each with 30 elements), and the output has 5 lists (each with 3 elements). So perhaps each output list is derived from a subset of the input lists. For example, each output list corresponds to 6 input lists (30 input lists divided into 5 groups of 6 each, leading to 5 output lists). But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, each output list is derived from processing each input list individually. For example, each input list of 30 elements is transformed into an output of 3 elements. But in Example 0, there are 30 input lists and 5 output lists. So that would mean each output list is derived from 6 input lists. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the key is to look for a pattern that, for each input list, transforms it into a triplet based on certain rules. For instance, each input list is processed into an output triplet. But in Example 0, there are 30 input lists and 5 output triplets, which doesn't fit unless multiple input lists are combined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output lists are derived from specific rows in the input. For example, the first output list in Example 0 corresponds to the first 6 input lists processed in some way. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element is derived from a specific column in the input lists. For example, the input has 30 columns (since each list has 30 elements), and the output lists are derived from the sum or count of certain values in those columns. For instance, for each column across all input lists, count how many times a certain number appears. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each output list has three elements, perhaps the input lists are divided into groups of 10 elements, and each group is processed to form one output element. For example, each input list of 30 elements is split into three groups of 10, and each group is transformed into a single number. Then, the output is a list of these triplets for each input list. But in Example 0's output, there are 5 triplets, which would suggest that the input has 5 lists, but looking back, the input for Example 0 has 30 lists. So this doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a formatting mistake. Let me check the actual data again.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nThe INPUT starts with a list, then another list, etc. Counting them:\n\nThere are 30 lists in the INPUT for Example 0. Then the OUTPUT has 5 lists. So the transformation is taking 30 input lists and producing 5 output lists. So each output list is derived from 6 input lists (30 / 5 = 6). So for Example 0, 6 input lists are combined to generate one output list of three elements. \n\nHow could that work? For example, each group of 6 input lists is processed into a triplet. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first output is [3,3,0]. Let's look at the first six input lists:\n\nInput 0: [1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0, ...]\nInput 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ...]\nInput 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5, ...]\nInput 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0, ...]\nInput 4: [0,0,0,5,1,0,0,0,5,0, ...]\nInput 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ...]\n\nLooking at these, maybe for each of the 6 input lists, we take certain elements and sum or count them. For example, count the number of 5s in each of the 6 lists. \n\nInput 0: has a 5 in position 22.\nInput 1: has a 5 in position 15.\nInput 2: has a 5 in position 10.\nInput 3: has 5s in positions 8 and 15.\nInput 4: has 5s in positions 3, 8, 15.\nInput 5: no 5s.\n\nSo total 5s across these 6 lists: 1 +1 +1 +2 +3 +0 = 8. But the output is [3,3,0]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each of the three positions in the output, we look at a specific position across the 6 input lists. For example, the first element of the output triplet is the count of a certain number in position 0 of each of the 6 input lists. \n\nInput 0's position 0: 1.\n\nInput 1's position 0: 0.\n\nInput 2's position 0: 0.\n\nInput 3's position 0: 0.\n\nInput 4's position 0: 0.\n\nInput 5's position 0: 0.\n\nCount of 1s in position 0: 1. But output's first element is 3. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the first elements of the six input lists: 1+0+0+0+0+0=1. Not 3.\n\nHmm. This is getting too complicated. Perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: in both training examples, the output numbers (3 and 4) are one higher than the maximum numbers in the input lists. For Example 0, the input has 5s and 3s, and output is 3s. For Example 1, input has 4s and 2s, output has 4s. So maybe the output numbers are the maximum value in the entire input matrix plus one, but that doesn't fit. Example 0's input has 5s, output is 3s. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output numbers are the count of a certain number in each of three regions of the input lists. For example, in Example 0, perhaps each output element is the number of times 5 appears in a certain group of 10 positions across all input lists. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's output is five lists. Each output list has three elements. Suppose each output list corresponds to a group of six input lists. For each output list, the three elements are the count of 5s in three different sections (each 10 elements) across those six input lists.\n\nFor example, the first output list [3,3,0] would be the count of 5s in the first, second, and third sections of the first six input lists.\n\nLet's compute that:\n\nFirst six input lists:\n\nInput 0: 5 at position 22 (third section).\n\nInput 1: 5 at position 15 (second section).\n\nInput 2: 5 at position 10 (second section).\n\nInput 3: 5s at positions 8 (first section?), 15 (second).\n\nInput 4: 5s at 3 (first section), 8 (first section), 15 (second section).\n\nInput 5: no 5s.\n\nSo for each input list, split into three sections (0-9, 10-19, 20-29).\n\nFirst section (0-9):\n\nInput 0: no 5s.\n\nInput 1: no 5s.\n\nInput 2: no 5s.\n\nInput 3: 5 at position 8 (first section).\n\nInput 4: 5 at position 3 and 8 (first section).\n\nInput 5: no 5s.\n\nTotal 5s in first sections: 1 (input 3) +2 (input4) =3. So first output element is 3.\n\nSecond section (10-19):\n\nInput 0: no 5s.\n\nInput 1: 5 at 15 (second section).\n\nInput 2: 5 at 10 (second section).\n\nInput 3: 5 at 15 (second section).\n\nInput 4: 5 at 15 (second section).\n\nInput 5: no 5s.\n\nCount for second sections: 1 (input1) +1 (input2) +1 (input3) +1 (input4) =4. But the output's second element is 3. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative idea: the output lists in Example 0 have elements 3 and 0, and the input lists contain 3s. Looking at input list 10 in Example 0:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis list has two 3s in positions 11 and 12 (second section). The output for this group might be [0,3,0], but I'm not sure which output list this belongs to.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output triplet is derived from a single input list. For example, each input list of 30 elements is transformed into a triplet. But in Example 0's input, there are 30 input lists, but the output has 5 triplets. So this would imply that 6 input lists are combined into one output triplet. \n\nBut how?\n\nAnother observation: the output numbers are all 3s and 0s in Example 0. The input lists have 5s, 1s, and 3s. Maybe each output element is the count of the number 3 in each third of the input lists. For example, the first output element is the count of 3s in the first third of all input lists in a group. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the count of the number of times a particular digit appears in specific positions across multiple input lists. For example, in Example 0, if the output is [3,3,0], maybe in the first third of six input lists, the number 3 appears three times in a certain position.\n\nThis seems too vague. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the positions of the output elements. For example, in Example 0's output, the first two elements are 3s and the third is 0. Maybe this corresponds to the presence of a certain pattern in the input lists.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the first, second, and third parts of each input list modulo 4 or something. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Let me try to think of the test input. The test input has numbers like 1, 3, 8. For example, one of the test input lists is:\n\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSplit into thirds:\n\n0-9: contains 1,3,8.\n\n10-19: contains 3,8.\n\n20-29: all zeros.\n\nIf the output is based on the maximum number in each third, the output would be [8, 8, 0]. But the training examples don't have outputs with numbers higher than 4. So maybe the output is the count of the highest number in each third. For this test list, the highest in first third is 8 (count 1), second third is 8 (count 1), third third is 0 (count 0). So output would be [1,1,0]. But the training examples don't follow this pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of each third modulo some number. For example, sum first third: 0+0+1+0+3+0+8+0+0+0 =12 \u2192 12 mod 4 is 0, but output elements in training examples are 3s and 4s.\n\nAnother idea: the output numbers are the count of a certain number in each third. For Example 0, perhaps counting the number of 5s, and for Example 1, counting the number of 4s. \n\nIn Example 0's first output [3,3,0], the first two sections have 3 instances of 5s. But looking at the first six input lists, the total 5s in first third (0-9) would be:\n\nInput 0: no 5s in first third.\n\nInput 1: no.\n\nInput 2: no.\n\nInput 3: 5 at position 8 (first third).\n\nInput 4: 5s at 3 and 8 (first third).\n\nInput 5: no.\n\nSo total 3 5s in first third \u2192 first output element 3.\n\nSecond third (10-19):\n\nInput 0: no 5s.\n\nInput 1: 5 at 15 (second third).\n\nInput 2: 5 at 10 (second third).\n\nInput 3: 5 at 15.\n\nInput 4: 5 at 15.\n\nInput 5: no.\n\nTotal 4 5s \u2192 output second element 3. Doesn't match.\n\nBut maybe it's the number of input lists in the group that have at least one 5 in the respective third. For example, in the first third:\n\nInput 3 has one 5.\n\nInput4 has two 5s.\n\nSo two input lists have 5s in first third. But output is 3. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, it's the sum of all 5s in the third across all six input lists. For first third:\n\nInput3 has one 5, input4 has two \u2192 total 3. So output first element 3.\n\nSecond third: input1, input2, input3, input4 have 5s \u2192 input1:1, input2:1, input3:1, input4:1 \u2192 total 4 \u2192 output second element 3. Doesn't match.\n\nBut maybe it's the count of input lists that have at least one 5 in the respective third. For example, in the first third:\n\nInput3 and input4 have 5s \u2192 count 2. Output is 3. No.\n\nThis is really perplexing. Let's try to look for another pattern. In Example 0's output, the elements are 3s and 0s. The input lists have 5s and 1s. In Example 1's output, the elements are 4s and 0s. The input lists have 2s and 4s. So the output number seems to be one higher than the highest number in the input. For Example 0, highest is 5 \u2192 output 3? No. For Example 1, highest is 4 \u2192 output 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output number is the number of different digits present in the section. For example, in Example 0's first third of the first six input lists, the digits present are 1, 3, 5. So three digits \u2192 output 3. For Example 1's first output triplet [0,4,0], maybe the second third has four different digits, but that's unlikely.\n\nAnother angle: the output numbers might represent the number of times a certain digit appears in a specific position across the input lists. For instance, in Example 0's output [3,3,0], the first two elements are 3, which could indicate that in the first two sections of the input lists, the digit 5 appears three times each, and 0 in the third. But earlier calculations didn't confirm this.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern that would lead to a plausible answer, even if I'm not entirely sure of the mechanism.\n\nThe test input has numbers like 1, 3, 8, 2. Let's assume that the output is based on the highest number in each third of each input list. For example, for a given input list, split into three sections, take the maximum of each, and then the output triplet is those maxima. But in the training examples, this doesn't fit. Alternatively, if the output triplet is the count of the highest number in each section.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of certain digits in each third. For example, in the test input, if there's an 8 in a section, that's the highest, and the output is 8. But the training examples don't support this.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the training outputs, each output list has three elements, which could be related to the numbers 3 and 4. Maybe the output is the count of a certain triplet in the input. For example, in Example 0, maybe three consecutive 5s or 1s. But I don't see such triplets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived from the count of a certain number in three specific positions. For example, positions 0, 10, and 20. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I'll have to make an educated guess. In Example 0, the output elements are all 3s and 0s. The input lists have 5s and 1s, and some 3s. In Example 1, outputs are 4s and 0s, with inputs having 4s. So perhaps the output is the count of the highest number in each third. For Example 0, the highest number is 5. But the output is 3. So maybe it's the count of the number that is one less than the highest. For example, highest is 5, so count 4. No.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the count of the second highest number. For Example 0, the second highest is 3. So count the number of 3s in each third. For the first six input lists in Example 0, there are no 3s except in input list 10 and 11. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven that in Example 1's output, the number 4 appears, and the input lists have 4s, perhaps the output is the count of the highest number in each third. For example, if a third has a 4, then the output is 4. But in Example 1's first input list, there are no 4s, but the output is [0,4,0]. So that's not.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to determine the exact pattern. However, given that the test input contains the number 8, which is higher than any in the training examples, and the outputs in the training examples use the highest number present (3 and 4), I'll guess that the output for the test input will have 8s. But in the training examples, the output numbers are not the highest input numbers. For example, Example 0's input has 5s and 3s, but the output is 3s. So maybe the output number is the highest number minus 2. 5-2=3, 4-0=4. So for the test input, which has 8s, the output would be 6. But the training examples don't follow this.\n\nAlternatively, the output number is the count of the most frequent number in each third. For example, in the first third of the test input lists, if 8 appears the most, then the output is the count. But without knowing how the training examples were processed, it's hard to apply.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the lack of progress, I'll have to make a guess based on the structure of the training examples. In Example 0, the output is 3 when there are multiple 5s or 3s. In Example 1, it's 4 when there are 4s. For the test input, which has 8s, the output might be the count of 8s in each third, or perhaps the output is based on the presence of 8s. However, without a clear pattern, I'll hazard a guess that each output triplet is the count of the number 8 in each third of the input lists. But this is just a guess.\n\nFor example, looking at the first test input list:\n\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSplit into thirds:\n\n0-9: 8 appears once.\n\n10-19: 8 appears once.\n\n20-29: no 8s.\n\nSo if the output is the count of 8s in each third, the output would be [1,1,0]. But the training examples don't align with this, so this is likely incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of the numbers in each third. For this test input list:\n\n0-9: 0+0+1+0+3+0+8+0+0+0 =12.\n\n10-19: 0+0+0+0+0+0+0+3+0+8=11.\n\n20-29: 0s. Sum 0.\n\nBut the output would be [12,11,0], which doesn't match the training examples.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll look for another pattern. In Example 0, the output lists are:\n\n[3,3,0]\n[3,3,3]\n[3,0,3]\n[3,3,3]\n[0,3,3]\n\nThese look like possible binary representations (if 3 is considered as 1 and 0 as 0), but that's a stretch. Alternatively, the numbers might represent something like the number of occurrences of certain digits in the input. \n\nAnother observation: the outputs in Example 0 and Example 1 have exactly three elements each, and each output list has a combination of the same numbers. This suggests that each output element might correspond to a different digit's count in each third of the input.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to make an educated guess that the output is derived by counting the occurrences of the highest digit in each third of the input lists. For the test input, the highest digit is 8. So for each third of each input list, count the number of 8s, and sum them across the input lists in groups. But without knowing how the groups are formed, this is speculative.\n\nAssuming that each output list corresponds to a group of six input lists (as there are 30 inputs and 5 outputs), and each element of the output is the count of the highest digit in each third of those six lists. For example, if the highest digit is 8, then count the 8s in each third across six input lists.\n\nFor the test input's first six lists:\n\nEach list has varying numbers of 8s. For example, the first list has 8s in the first and second thirds. The second list has 8s in the third third. \n\nBut this is pure guesswork. Given the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to provide a plausible answer based on the training examples' structure. Since the test input has 8s, maybe the output will have 8s or counts related to them. However, given that the training examples' outputs are 3 and 4, which are lower than the maximums in their inputs, perhaps the output is the count of a certain digit in each third. For the test input, maybe the counts of 8s. \n\nBut since I'm not sure, I'll have to make a guess. Based on the training examples, each output triplet has the same number repeated (like [3,3,3]) or a combination. For the test input, perhaps each triplet will be [8,8,0], but the outputs in the training examples don't follow this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the digits present in the input. For example, the test input has 8s, 3s, and 1s. If the output is the count of the digit 3 in each third, then for each input list's third, count the 3s and sum across groups. \n\nThis is all too uncertain. Given the time I've spent, I'll conclude that the pattern involves counting the number of occurrences of a certain digit (like 5 in Example 0 and 4 in Example 1) in each third of the input lists, grouped into sets of six lists, and the output elements are the counts of those digits. For the test input, the digit could be 8, leading to outputs like [count of 8s in first third, count in second, count in third]. \n\nGiven that the test input has multiple 8s, the output might look like:\n\n[3,3,0]\n[3,3,3]\netc.\n\nBut this is purely a guess. \n\nGiven the training examples and the structure of the outputs, I'll assume that the output is generated by counting the number of times the highest digit in each third appears across the input lists, grouped into sets of six. \n\nFor the test input, the highest digit is 8. So each output triplet would be the count of 8s in each third across six input lists. \n\nLooking at the first six test input lists:\n\nList 0: 8s in first and second thirds.\n\nList 1: 8s in third third.\n\nList 2: 8s in third third.\n\nList 3: 8 in first third.\n\nList 4: 8s in third third.\n\nList 5: 8 in third third.\n\nCounting for first third (0-9):\n\nList 0: 1.\n\nList 3: 1.\n\nOthers: 0.\n\nTotal: 2 \u2192 output first element 2.\n\nSecond third (10-19):\n\nList 0: 1.\n\nOthers: 0.\n\nTotal: 1 \u2192 output second element 1.\n\nThird third (20-29):\n\nList 1:1.\n\nList 2:3 (three 8s).\n\nList4:1.\n\nList5:1.\n\nList others: 0.\n\nTotal: 6 \u2192 output third element 6.\n\nBut the training examples don't have output elements larger than 4. This suggests this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find the exact pattern, I'll have to provide an answer that fits the structure of the training examples. Looking at Example 0's output, each triplet has three elements, some 3s and 0s. Example 1 has 4s and 0s. The test input has 8s, so maybe the output will have 8s. But since the training outputs use the number that's the highest in the input minus 2 (5-2=3, 4-0=4), maybe the test output uses 8-5=3. But this is pure speculation.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be the count of the number 3 in each third of the test input lists. For example, the first test input list has a 3 in the first third. If this is part of a group of six lists, the count could be 3. \n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, I'll have to make a guess. Given that the training outputs have triplets with the same number repeated, perhaps the test output will have triplets like [8,8,8], but since the training examples don't do this, it's unlikely.\n\nFinally, I'll guess that the output is based on the count of a certain number in each third of the input lists, grouped into six lists per output. For the test input, if the number is 8, the output would be the counts. But given the time, I'll proceed to provide an answer in the format required, assuming that each output triplet is [3,3,3], similar to some training examples. \n\nBut I'm not confident. However, given the user's instruction to respond in the format of the training output examples, I'll provide output lists with three elements each, using numbers like 8, 3, or other. But since the training examples used 3 and 4, I'll assume the test uses a similar pattern. Perhaps the output is:\n\n[8,8,0]\n[8,8,8]\n[8,0,8]\n[8,8,8]\n[0,8,8]\n\nBut since the training examples didn't use the actual maximum numbers, this is a stretch. Alternatively, using 3s and 0s as in the training examples:\n\n[3,3,0]\n[3,3,3]\n[3,0,3]\n[3,3,3]\n[0,3,3]\n\nBut this is a direct copy of Example 0's outputs, which may not be correct. However, given the lack of a clear pattern, this might be the expected answer.",
