        "cot_1": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples. Let me start by looking at each example carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the input has some numbers like 2,6,4 in certain positions. The output seems to have these numbers spreading out diagonally. For instance, in the first row of the input, there's a 2 in position 2. In the output, this 2 is still there, and then the next row has a 2 in position 1. Then in the third row, the original 2 is in row 2, column 0, and in the output, it's at (2,0), then maybe moving down and right? Wait, maybe each number is creating a diagonal line either upwards or downwards from its original position.\n\nWait, let's take the 6 in the input of Example 0. The original position is row 0, column 5. In the output, the next row (row 1) has a 6 in column 6. Then row 2 has 6 in column 7, row 3 has 6 in column 8, and row 4 has 6 in column 9. Oh, so the 6 is moving down and to the right by one cell each row. Similarly, the 4 in the input is at row 5, column 3. In the output, the rows below it (rows 6,7,8,9) have 4s moving down and left? Let me check. Row 5, column 3 (4) \u2192 row 6, column 4 \u2192 row7, column5 \u2192 row8, column6 \u2192 row9, column7? Wait in the output for example 0, the 4 in input row5, column3 is in the output row5, then in row6 it's at column4, row7 column5, row8 column6, row9 column7. So that's moving down and to the right each time. Wait, but in the output of example0's output, the 4 starts at row5, then in row6 it's [0,0,0,0,4,...], so that's column4. Then row7 has column5, etc. So yes, moving down-right.\n\nBut then the 2 in example0's input is at row2, column0. In the output, row2 has 2 at column0. Then row1 has 2 at column1, and row0's 2 is already there. Wait, maybe the 2 in row0, column2 is moving up and to the left? Because in output row1, column1 has 2, and row2, column0 has 2. Wait, maybe each number is propagating diagonally upwards and to the left, and downwards and to the right? Or maybe each number splits into two directions. Let's see:\n\nIn example0's input, the 2 at (0,2) (row 0, column2) in the input. In the output, row0 has it, then row1 column1, row2 column0. So that's moving down-left. Similarly, the 6 in row0, column5 in input. In output, row0:6 stays, row1 column6, row2 column7, etc. So that's moving down-right. The 4 in row5 column3: output row5 has 4, row6 column4, row7 column5, etc. So also down-right.\n\nWait, but the 4 in example0's input is in row5, column3. The output's row5 has 4 in column3, then row6 column4, row7 column5, etc. So that's moving down-right each step. But then the 2 in row2 column0 (input) in the output, in row1 column1 and row0 column2? Wait no, original input's row2 column0 has 2. In the output, the first row (row0) has 2 in column2, but the output row1 has 2 in column1, and row2 has 2 in column0. So maybe the original 2 is moving up-left each step. Because row2's 2 is moving up each row. So row2's 2 is at (2,0), then in row1 (column1), row0 (column2). So it's moving up and to the right? Wait, row2, column0 \u2192 row1, column1 \u2192 row0, column2. That's moving up and to the right, but the direction is up and right, but the initial position in row0 is in column2. Wait, perhaps each non-zero number propagates diagonally upwards and to the right, and also downwards and to the right. Or maybe each non-zero number creates a diagonal line both upwards and downwards. But in example0's output, the 6 in input row0, column5 is moving down-right. The 2 in input row0, column2 is moving down-left. Wait, maybe the direction depends on the original position? No, that's not likely.\n\nWait, let's look at example1. The input has a 9 at (0,0) and a 3 at (0,7). In the output, the 9 seems to be moving down-right. For example, row0:9 at (0,0), row1:9 at (1,1), row2:9 at (2,2), etc. The 3 at (0,7) moves down-right as well. Then the 8 in row2, column6 and 3 in row2, column9. Wait the 8 is in row2, column6. In the output, row3 has a 9 (from the 9 in row3 column3 of input?), but the 8 in input row2 column6 seems to spread. Let me check the output of example1. The output for example1 has in row2: 9, 0, 0, then 8 at column6. Then row3 has 9 and 8. So maybe the 8 from row2, column6 is moving down-left? Because row3 has 8 in column5, row4 column4, etc. So 8 is moving down-left. Similarly, the 7 in input row5 column5 (7) in example1's output moves down-left: row5 has 7, row6 column6, row7 column7, etc. Wait, no, example1's input has 7 at row5 column5. Output row5 has 7 in column5, then row6 has 7 in column6, row7 in column7, etc. Wait no, in example1's output, row5 is [0,0,0,8,0,7,0,0,0,0]. So the 7 is in column5. Then row6 has 7 in column6, row7 has 7 in column7, etc. So 7 is moving down-right. Similarly, the 8 in input row2 column6 (8) is in output row2, column6. Then row3 column5, row4 column4, etc. So 8 is moving down-left. Hmm, so numbers can move in different directions. How to determine the direction?\n\nLooking at example0 again: the 6 in input row0 column5 moves down-right. The 2 in row0 column2 moves down-left (since row1 column1, row2 column0). Wait, but the 2 in row0's input is at column2. So in the output, the 2 is in row0 column2, then row1 column1, row2 column0. So that's moving down-left. Then the 6 in row0 column5 moves down-right. So maybe even numbers go down-right and odd go down-left? But example1's 9 (odd?) in row0 column0 moves down-right. The 3 (odd) in row0 column7 moves down-right. The 8 (even) in row2 column6 moves down-left. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the value's position. For example, if the number is in a certain row or column, it moves in a certain direction. Alternatively, maybe each number propagates both upwards and downwards, but the examples don't show that. For example, in example0's output, the 6 only propagates down-right, and the 2 propagates down-left. So perhaps each number propagates in a single direction, which direction depends on something else.\n\nWait, looking at example2's input. The input has a 6 at row0 column3 and 8 at row0 column5. The output for 6: row0,3; row1,2; row2,1; row3,0. Then the 8 at row0 column5: in output, row0 column5, then row1 column6, row2 column7, etc. So 6 is moving down-left, 8 down-right. Then the 4 in row2 column2 (input) in example2's input: the output shows row2 has 4, then row3 column3, row4 column4, etc. So 4 is moving down-right. But in example0, the 4 in input row5 column3 moves down-right. So why in example2, the 6 is moving down-left?\n\nWait, perhaps the direction is determined by the original position. For example, numbers in even rows move down-right, odd rows down-left? Not sure. Let's check:\n\nExample0's 6 is in row0 (even) and moves down-right. The 2 in row0 (even) moves down-left. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the number's value. For example, even numbers move down-right, odd down-left. But in example0, 2 is even and moves down-left. 6 is even and moves down-right. So that contradicts. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction alternates based on the number's parity. For example, even numbers go down-right, odd numbers down-left. But in example0, 6 (even) goes down-right, 4 (even) goes down-right, 2 (even) goes down-left. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output grids, each number is part of a diagonal line starting from the input position. For example, in example0, the 6 starts at (0,5) and then each subsequent row, the 6 moves right by one (so direction is down-right). Similarly, the 2 in (0,2) moves left each row (down-left). Wait, how? Because row0's 2 is at (0,2), then row1's is at (1,1), row2 at (2,0). So each step down, moving left by 2. Wait, no, each row down, column decreases by 1. So direction is down-left.\n\nSo perhaps, the pattern is: each non-zero number in the input creates a diagonal line in the output, moving down and to the left if the number is even, and down and to the right if odd? Let's check examples.\n\nExample0's 2 is even. The diagonal is down-left. 6 is even, moving down-right? Wait no, 6 in example0 starts at (0,5) and in output rows, it's moving down-right (column increases by 1 each row). So that's down-right, but 6 is even. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all numbers move down-right, but some examples have other numbers. Wait example2's input has a 6 at (0,3). The output shows it moving down-left. Let's see:\n\nIn example2's input, the 6 is at row0 column3. The output for row1 has 6 at column2, row2 column1, row3 column0. So that's moving down-left. The 8 in row0 column5 moves down-right. So what's the difference between 6 and 8 here? 6 is even, 8 is even. So parity isn't the factor.\n\nLooking at example2's input: the 6 is at (0,3), 8 at (0,5). The 6's diagonal is moving down-left, while the 8 moves down-right. So perhaps the direction depends on the original column. For example, if the column is even, move left; if odd, move right? Let's check:\n\nIn example0's 6 is at column5 (odd), moving right. 2 at column2 (even), moving left. That fits. In example1's 9 is at column0 (even) moving right (since in example1's output, 9 moves down-right). Wait, no. In example1's input, the 9 is at (0,0). The output shows 9 moving down-right: row0 (0,0), row1 (1,1), row2 (2,2), etc. So column0 is even, direction is down-right. Hmm, this contradicts the previous idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the original row's parity. If the row is even, direction is down-right; if odd, down-left. But example0's 6 is in row0 (even), direction down-right. The 2 in row0 (even) direction down-left. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the number's value. For example, numbers greater than some value go right, others left. But 6 and 8 in example0 and 2 would be split.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction alternates per example. But that doesn't make sense. The pattern has to be consistent across all examples.\n\nWait, maybe the direction is determined by the original position's row and column. For example, if the sum of the row and column indices is even or odd. Let's check:\n\nExample0's 6 is at (0,5). 0+5=5 (odd). So direction down-right. 2 at (0,2): 0+2=2 (even). Direction down-left. That could be. Let's see:\n\nIf sum of (row + column) is even \u2192 down-left, else down-right.\n\nTest this hypothesis:\n\nExample0's 6: (0,5) sum 5 (odd) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\nExample0's 2: (0,2) sum 2 (even) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\nExample0's 4 in row5, column3: 5+3=8 (even) \u2192 down-left. Wait in example0's output, the 4 moves down-right. So that's a problem. Because 5+3=8 (even) would imply down-left, but the 4 moves down-right. Hmm. So that contradicts.\n\nAnother approach: look at the movement of numbers in the output.\n\nIn example0, the 2 in row0, column2 (input) \u2192 in output, row0:2, row1:2 (column1), row2:2 (column0). So direction is down-left. The 6 in row0, column5 \u2192 output rows have 6 moving down-right. The 4 in row5, column3 \u2192 moves down-right (row5,3 \u2192 row6,4 \u2192 row7,5, etc). So 5+3=8 (even) but direction is down-right. So sum even doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps each number creates a diagonal line going both down-left and down-right. But looking at example0's output for the 2: only down-left. The 6 only down-right. So perhaps each number only propagates in one direction. How is that direction chosen?\n\nWait, example1's input has 9 at (0,0). Output shows it moving down-right. The 3 at (0,7) moves down-right (row0,7 \u2192 row1,8 \u2192 row2,9). The 8 at (2,6) \u2192 moves down-left (row2,6 \u2192 row3,5 \u2192 row4,4 etc.). The 7 in input row5,5 \u2192 moves down-right (row5,5 \u2192 row6,6 \u2192 row7,7 etc.). So 8 is even, moves down-left. 7 is odd, moves down-right. 9 is odd, moves down-right. 3 is odd, moves down-right. So the direction for 8 (even) is down-left, while for others it's down-right. So maybe even numbers move down-left, odd numbers down-right?\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample0:\n\n- 2 (even) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n-6 (even) \u2192 down-right. No, that's a problem. 6 is even but moves down-right. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. So that's not the case. So perhaps the direction isn't determined by parity.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the movement direction based on some other property. For example, in example0, the 6 is in column5 (which is odd) and moves down-right. The 2 is in column2 (even) and moves down-left. The 4 in column3 (odd) moves down-right. So if column is even, move left; if odd, move right. Let's test this.\n\nExample0's 2 in column2 (even) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n6 in column5 (odd) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n4 in column3 (odd) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\nExample1's 9 in column0 (even) \u2192 down-right. But according to this rule, even column should move left. So this contradicts.\n\nExample1's 3 in column7 (odd) \u2192 down-right. Correct per rule.\n\nThe 8 in column6 (even) in example1's input (row2, column6) \u2192 even column, should move left. But in example1's output, the 8 moves down-left. For example, row2 column6, then row3 column5, row4 column4, etc. So yes, moving left. So that fits. The 7 in example1's input is in column5 (odd), so should move right. But in example1's output, the 7 in row5,5 moves down-right (row5,5 \u2192 row6,6 \u2192 row7,7 etc.), which fits.\n\nSo the rule could be: for each non-zero number, if the original column is even, the number propagates down-left (each step down, column decreases by 1). If the original column is odd, propagates down-right (each step down, column increases by 1).\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample0's 2 in column2 (even) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n6 in column5 (odd) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n4 in column3 (odd) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\nExample1's 9 in column0 (even) \u2192 down-left. But in example1's output, the 9 moves down-right. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, example1's 9 is at (0,0). Column0 is even. According to the rule, it should move down-left. But in the output, it moves down-right. So this is a problem.\n\nHmm. So the column parity rule doesn't hold here. Maybe there's another factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction is determined by whether the original position's row is even or odd. Let's see:\n\nIf original row is even \u2192 down-right; if odd \u2192 down-left.\n\nExample0's 6 is in row0 (even) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n2 in row0 (even) \u2192 down-right. But example0's 2 moves down-left. So no.\n\nAlternatively, row parity determines direction. For example, even rows \u2192 down-left; odd rows \u2192 down-right. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the start and end positions.\n\nFor example0's 2 at (0,2) in input. Output has 2 at (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So each step, row increases by 1, column decreases by 1. So direction is down-left.\n\nFor 6 at (0,5) in input. Output steps: (0,5), (1,6), (2,7), (3,8), (4,9). So each step, row increases by 1, column increases by 1. Direction down-right.\n\nFor 4 at (5,3) in input. Output steps: (5,3), (6,4), (7,5), (8,6), (9,7). Down-right.\n\nSo why is the 2 in example0 moving down-left, while the 6 and 4 move down-right?\n\nLooking at the input positions:\n\n2 is at (0,2). The 6 is at (0,5). The 4 is at (5,3).\n\nHmm. What's the difference between 2 and the others? The 2 is in row0, column2. The 6 is row0, column5. The 4 is row5, column3. No obvious pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps numbers in the first row (row0) move down-left, others down-right. But example0's 6 is also in row0 and moves down-right. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is determined by the number's value modulo something. For example, 2 mod 4 is 2, 6 mod4 is 2, 4 mod4 is 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's based on the sum of row and column. For example, if (row - column) is even, move down-right, else down-left.\n\nFor example0's 2 at (0,2): row - column = 0-2 = -2, even. So down-right. But in example0, it moves down-left. So no.\n\nAlternatively, (row + column) even/odd. For (0,2) sum 2, even \u2192 direction down-left. For (0,5) sum 5, odd \u2192 direction down-right. For (5,3) sum 8, even \u2192 direction down-right. But this doesn't fit. So sum even leads to down-left or down-right? For example0's 2 sum even, down-left. For 5+3=8 even, down-right. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe each number creates a diagonal that starts at the original position and extends down in both directions (left and right). But looking at the examples, the outputs only have numbers in one direction. For example, in example0's 2 only extends down-left, 6 down-right, 4 down-right. So maybe numbers are only extended in one direction. So how to determine which direction.\n\nLooking back at example2: 6 at (0,3) moves down-left. 8 at (0,5) moves down-right. What's the difference between columns3 and5? 3 is odd, 5 is odd. So the parity of the column is same. Why different directions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction alternates based on the row. For example, if the row is even, move down-left; if odd, down-right. But in example0's 6 in row0 (even) moves down-right.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's try to see if there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at example2's output:\n\nThe 6 starts at (0,3) and moves down-left each row: (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0).\n\nThe 8 starts at (0,5) and moves down-right: (0,5), (1,6), (2,7), etc.\n\nThe 4 in input at (2,2) moves down-right: (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), etc.\n\nSo why the 6 and 8 in example2's input, which are both even, move in different directions. The 6 is at (0,3), 8 at (0,5). So columns 3 and 5 are both odd. So no.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the direction depends on the original cell's position relative to the center of the grid. But the grid is 10x10, so center between 4.5. But that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the number's value. For example, numbers with values less than 5 move left, others right. But example0's 2 (less than 5) moves left, 6 (more than 5) moves right. 4 (less than5) moves right. So no.\n\nWait, example0's 4 is in row5, column3. Direction is down-right. 4 is less than5 but moves right. So that's not.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider the output as the input plus additional numbers along diagonals. For each non-zero number in the input, we add numbers in a diagonal line either to the bottom-left or bottom-right.\n\nThe key is to find what determines the direction for each number.\n\nLooking at example1's input:\n\n- 9 at (0,0) moves down-right: each row increases, column increases.\n\n- 3 at (0,7) moves down-right: row increases, column increases.\n\n- 8 at (2,6) moves down-left: row increases, column decreases.\n\n- 7 at (5,5) moves down-right.\n\nSo for the 9 and 3, the direction is down-right. The 8's direction is down-left. The 7's direction is down-right.\n\nWhat's the difference between 8 and the others?\n\nPerhaps the direction is based on the number's value. Let's see:\n\n9 is odd \u2192 down-right.\n\n3 is odd \u2192 down-right.\n\n8 is even \u2192 down-left.\n\n7 is odd \u2192 down-right.\n\nSo this fits: even numbers move down-left, odd numbers down-right.\n\nLet's check other examples.\n\nExample0:\n\n2 (even) \u2192 down-left.\n\n6 (even) \u2192 down-right. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\n4 (even) \u2192 down-right. Also a problem.\n\nSo this rule doesn't hold.\n\nWait, but example0's 6 is even and moves down-right. So that contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction is determined by the number's parity, but the opposite: even numbers move down-right, odd down-left. Let's see:\n\nExample1's 8 (even) \u2192 down-left. Contradicts.\n\nExample0's 2 (even) \u2192 down-left. Even would mean down-right. So no.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the number's position in the row. For instance, numbers in the first half of the row move left, second half move right. But example0's 2 is in column2 (row0, columns 0-9), first half (0-4.5). So column2 is first half. So move left. The 6 is in column5, second half. Move right. 4 in column3 (first half, move left). But example0's 4 moves right. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the direction is determined by whether the number is in an even or odd column. For even columns, move down-left; odd columns, down-right.\n\nExample0's 2 in column2 (even) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n6 in column5 (odd) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n4 in column3 (odd) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\nExample1's 9 in column0 (even) \u2192 down-left. But in example1's output, the 9 moves down-right. So this is a problem.\n\nHmm. So why is the 9 in example1's output moving down-right when it's in column0 (even)?\n\nThis suggests that the column parity rule is not the answer.\n\nAnother observation: Looking at example2's input and output.\n\nInput has 6 at (0,3) and 8 at (0,5). Both even columns (3 is odd, 5 is odd). Wait, but 3 is odd. So according to column parity, 6 is in odd column (3) \u2192 down-right. But in example2's output, the 6 moves down-left. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, example2's 6 is in column3 (odd) \u2192 according to the previous hypothesis, should move down-right. But in the output, it moves down-left. So this is a problem.\n\nThis suggests that the previous hypotheses are incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's try to see the general pattern.\n\nFor each non-zero number in the input, the output creates a diagonal line of that number starting at the input position and extending downward. The direction of the diagonal is either to the left or to the right.\n\nThe key is to determine the direction for each number.\n\nLooking at example1's 9 at (0,0). The output diagonal moves down-right. The 3 at (0,7) moves down-right. The 8 at (2,6) moves down-left. The 7 at (5,5) moves down-right.\n\nIn example2:\n\n6 at (0,3) moves down-left.\n\n8 at (0,5) moves down-right.\n\n4 at (2,2) moves down-right.\n\nSo why the difference between 6 and 8 in example2?\n\nThe only difference is their positions: 6 is in column3, 8 in column5. Maybe if the column is less than the row index, move left, otherwise right? Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the direction is determined by the sum of the row and column indices. If the sum is even, move down-left; if odd, move down-right.\n\nFor example0's 2 at (0,2): sum=2 (even) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n6 at (0,5): sum=5 (odd) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n4 at (5,3): sum=8 (even) \u2192 down-left. But in example0's output, 4 moves down-right. So this is wrong.\n\nSo this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the difference between the row and column. For example, (row - column) even or odd.\n\nFor example0's 2: 0-2=-2 (even) \u2192 down-left. 6: 0-5=-5 (odd) \u2192 down-right. 4:5-3=2 (even) \u2192 down-left. But in example0's output, 4 moves down-right. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting really frustrating. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nPerhaps each number creates a diagonal that starts at its position and moves down to the right if the number is on the left side of the grid and down to the left if on the right side. But how to define left and right.\n\nAlternatively, if the column is less than the midpoint (which is 4.5 for columns 0-9), then down-right; else down-left. For example:\n\nIn example0, 2 is in column2 (left of midpoint) \u2192 down-right. But in example0's output, 2 moves down-left. So no.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the direction is determined by the original number's value. For example, numbers greater than 5 move down-right, others down-left. Let's see:\n\nExample0's 2 (<=5) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n6 (>5) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n4 (<=5) \u2192 down-left. But in example0's output, 4 moves down-right. So no.\n\nExample2's 6 (>5) \u2192 down-left. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the direction is determined by the position of the number in the input grid. For example, numbers in the upper half of the grid move down-right, lower half down-left. But example0's 4 is in row5 (lower half) and moves down-right. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, numbers in the first five rows move down-right, others down-left. Example0's 4 is in row5 (borderline) \u2192 moves down-right. So maybe row <5 down-right, row >=5 down-left. But example0's 4 is in row5 and moves down-right, which would fit. Example2's 6 is in row0 (upper) and moves down-left. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the direction is determined by the number's position relative to the main diagonal (where row = column). For example, numbers above the main diagonal (column > row) move down-left, below (column < row) move down-right. Or something like that.\n\nFor example0's 2 at (0,2): column > row \u2192 moves down-left.\n\n6 at (0,5): column> row \u2192 moves down-left. But in example0's output, it moves down-right. So no.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, numbers on or above the main diagonal move down-left, others down-right. Not sure.\n\nWait, example0's 6 is at (0,5), which is above the main diagonal (row=0, column=5>0). If above main diagonal \u2192 move down-left, but in example0, it moves down-right. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the output of example0. The input has three non-zero numbers: 2,6,4. In the output, each of these numbers creates a diagonal line. For the 2, the line is from (0,2) down-left. For 6, down-right. For 4, down-right.\n\nExample1's 9 creates a down-right line. The 3 creates a down-right line. The 8 creates a down-left line. The 7 creates a down-right line.\n\nExample2's 6 creates a down-left line. 8 creates down-right. 4 creates down-right.\n\nWhat's the commonality between 8 in example2 and 6 in example0 that both are moving down-right. Wait no, 6 in example0 moves down-right. 8 in example2 moves down-right. 6 in example2 moves down-left. 8 in example1 moves down-left.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's think differently.\n\nPerhaps the direction is determined by the number's original position and the number's value. For example, if the number is even, it moves down-left if in an even row, down-right if in an odd row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the number itself. For example, even numbers move down-left, odd down-right. Let's check:\n\nExample0:\n\n2 (even) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n6 (even) \u2192 down-right. Incorrect.\n\nSo no.\n\nExample1:\n\n8 (even) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n7 (odd) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n3 (odd) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n9 (odd) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\nExample2:\n\n6 (even) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n8 (even) \u2192 down-right. Incorrect.\n\nSo this works for some but not all.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps even numbers move down-left if they are in even columns, else down-right. Let's see:\n\nExample0's 2 in column2 (even) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n6 in column5 (odd) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n4 in column3 (odd) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\nExample1's 8 in column6 (even) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n7 in column5 (odd) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n9 in column0 (even) \u2192 down-left. But example1's output shows 9 moving down-right. So this is a problem.\n\nHmm. So this works for example0 and example1's 8 and 7, but not the 9.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLet's consider that each non-zero number in the input is the start of a diagonal line in the output. The direction of the diagonal depends on the number's position relative to other numbers. For example, if a number is on the same row as another number, they might influence each other's direction. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number propagates in both directions (down-left and down-right), but in the examples, only one direction is visible due to grid boundaries. For example, maybe in example0's 2 at (0,2) can't propagate up, so it starts at row0 and goes down-left. But that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is determined by whether the number is in the left or right half of the grid. Columns 0-4: left half, down-left. Columns5-9: right half, down-right. Let's test:\n\nExample0's 2 is in column2 (left) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n6 in column5 (right) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n4 in column3 (left) \u2192 down-left. But in example0's output, 4 moves down-right. So no.\n\nExample2's 6 is in column3 (left) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n8 in column5 (right) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n4 in column2 (left) \u2192 down-left. But in example2's output, the 4 moves down-right. So no.\n\nSo this works for some but not all.\n\nAnother observation: In example0's input, the 4 is in row5, column3. The output has 4 moving down-right. In example2's input, the 4 is in row2, column2 and moves down-right. So maybe the direction is down-right for all numbers except those in the first row. But example1's 9 is in row0 and moves down-right. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is down-right for all numbers except those in certain columns. But this doesn't explain example0's 2.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let's try to see if there's any other pattern. Let's look at the output for example0's 2:\n\nInput row0, column2. Output rows 0,1,2 have 2 in columns 2,1,0. So each step, column decreases by 1. So the direction is down-left.\n\nExample1's 9 in row0, column0. Output rows 0,1,2,3: columns 0,1,2,3. So direction down-right.\n\nExample1's 8 in row2, column6. Output rows2,3,4,5: columns6,5,4,3. So direction down-left.\n\nExample1's 7 in row5, column5. Output rows5,6,7,8,9: columns5,6,7,8,9. Direction down-right.\n\nExample2's 6 in row0, column3. Output rows0,1,2,3: columns3,2,1,0. Direction down-left.\n\nExample2's 8 in row0, column5. Output rows0,1,2,3: columns5,6,7,8. Direction down-right.\n\nExample2's 4 in row2, column2. Output rows2,3,4,5: columns2,3,4,5. Direction down-right.\n\nSo the direction seems to be:\n\nIf the number is in an even row, then down-right?\n\nNo. example0's 2 is in row0 (even) but moves down-left.\n\nExample2's 6 is in row0 (even) and moves down-left.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is down-right if the column is greater than the row, and down-left if column is less than or equal to row.\n\nExample0's 2 is at (0,2) \u2192 column (2) > row (0) \u2192 down-right. But it moves down-left. So no.\n\nExample1's 9 at (0,0): column=row \u2192 down-left. But it moves down-right. No.\n\nThis isn't working.\n\nI think I need to find a different approach. Let's look for the pattern in the output grids.\n\nIn example0's output:\n\nThe original numbers are 2,6,4.\n\nEach of these numbers creates a diagonal line:\n\n- 2: from (0,2) down-left to (2,0).\n\n-6: from (0,5) down-right to (4,9).\n\n-4: from (5,3) down-right to (9,7).\n\nIn example1's output:\n\n-9: from (0,0) down-right to (3,3).\n\n-3: from (0,7) down-right to (2,9).\n\n-8: from (2,6) down-left to (5,3).\n\n-7: from (5,5) down-right to (9,9).\n\nIn example2's output:\n\n-6: from (0,3) down-left to (3,0).\n\n-8: from (0,5) down-right to (4,9).\n\n-4: from (2,2) down-right to (5,5).\n\nAnother observation: The diagonal line for each number extends until it hits the edge of the grid. So the length of the diagonal depends on the original position.\n\nBut how is the direction chosen? It seems arbitrary, but there's a pattern. \n\nLooking at example1's 8 at (2,6) which moves down-left. But why? Perhaps because there's another number (9) in its path if it moved down-right? No, example1's 9 is at (0,0) moving down-right. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction is chosen such that the diagonal line is as long as possible. For example, if moving down-right allows more steps before hitting the grid edge than down-left, then move down-right. Let's test:\n\nExample0's 2 at (0,2):\n\nMoving down-right: from (0,2) to (9,11) \u2192 but column 11 is outside, so only until column9. Steps: 7 steps (rows0-9). But moving down-left: from (0,2) to (2,0) \u2192 3 steps. But the output has 3 steps. So the direction chosen allows shorter path. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother possibility: The direction is chosen to avoid overlapping with other numbers. But this is not likely, as the input has numbers in certain positions, and the output appends new numbers.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the direction is down-right for all numbers except those in column 0, which move down-right. But example0's 2 is in column2 and moves down-left.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let's try to find another way.\n\nWait, looking at the test input. Let's see what numbers are present.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,9]\n\nRow1: 7 in column0.\n\nRow3: 3 in column3.\n\nRow4:6 in column0.\n\nRow5:4 in column9.\n\nRow7:6 in column3,7 in column6.\n\nRow9:4 in column5.\n\nSo the numbers are 3,7,3,6,4,6,7,4.\n\nNow, applying the pattern from examples:\n\nFor each number, create a diagonal line in a certain direction.\n\nAssuming the direction is down-right for odd numbers and down-left for even.\n\n3 is odd \u2192 down-right.\n\n7 is odd \u2192 down-right.\n\n3 is odd \u2192 down-right.\n\n6 is even \u2192 down-left.\n\n4 is even \u2192 down-left.\n\n6 even \u2192 down-left.\n\n7 odd \u2192 down-right.\n\n4 even \u2192 down-left.\n\nSo in the test input, let's see:\n\nRow0's 3 is at (0,6). Odd, so down-right. So next rows would have 3 at (1,7), (2,8), (3,9), then beyond.\n\nRow0's 9 is at (0,9). Even number (9 is odd), so down-right. Wait 9 is odd. So direction down-right. But (0,9) is the last column. So can't move right. So the line would be only the original 9.\n\nRow1's 7 is at (1,0). Odd, down-right. So next rows: (2,1), (3,2), etc.\n\nRow3's 3 is at (3,3). Odd, down-right. So (4,4), (5,5), etc.\n\nRow4's 6 is at (4,0). Even, down-left. But can't move left from column0. So line is only (4,0).\n\nRow5's4 is at (5,9). Even, down-left. So (6,8), (7,7), (8,6), (9,5).\n\nRow7's6 at (7,3). Even, down-left. So (8,2), (9,1).\n\nRow7's7 at (7,6). Odd, down-right. So (8,7), (9,8).\n\nRow9's4 at (9,5). Even, down-left. But row9 is the last row. So no extension.\n\nNow, let's construct the output based on these directions.\n\nLet's go step by step:\n\nOriginal input rows (test input):\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,9]\n\nRow1: [7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,3,0,0,9,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nNow, applying the directions:\n\nProcessing each number:\n\nRow0,6:3 (odd) \u2192 down-right.\n\nSo:\n\nRow0:3 at 6.\n\nRow1:7 at 7.\n\nRow2:3 at8.\n\nRow3:3 at9.\n\nRow4:3 would go to 10, which is invalid. So stops at row3.\n\nRow0,9:9 (odd) \u2192 down-right. But column9 is the last. So no extension.\n\nRow1,0:7 (odd) \u2192 down-right.\n\nRow1:7 at0.\n\nRow2:7 at1.\n\nRow3:7 at2.\n\nRow4:7 at3.\n\nRow5:7 at4.\n\nRow6:7 at5.\n\nRow7:7 at6.\n\nRow8:7 at7.\n\nRow9:7 at8.\n\nRow3,3:3 (odd) \u2192 down-right.\n\nRow3:3 at3.\n\nRow4:3 at4.\n\nRow5:3 at5.\n\nRow6:3 at6.\n\nRow7:3 at7.\n\nRow8:3 at8.\n\nRow9:3 at9.\n\nRow3,6:9 (odd) \u2192 down-right.\n\nRow3:9 at6.\n\nRow4:9 at7.\n\nRow5:9 at8.\n\nRow6:9 at9.\n\nRow7:9 would go to 10, invalid.\n\nRow4,0:6 (even) \u2192 down-left. But column0 can't go left. So only in row4,0.\n\nRow5,9:4 (even) \u2192 down-left.\n\nRow5:4 at9.\n\nRow6:4 at8.\n\nRow7:4 at7.\n\nRow8:4 at6.\n\nRow9:4 at5.\n\nRow7,3:6 (even) \u2192 down-left.\n\nRow7:6 at3.\n\nRow8:6 at2.\n\nRow9:6 at1.\n\nRow7,6:7 (odd) \u2192 down-right.\n\nRow7:7 at6.\n\nRow8:7 at7.\n\nRow9:7 at8.\n\nRow9,5:4 (even) \u2192 down-left.\n\nRow9:4 at5.\n\nNow, let's combine all these into the output grid.\n\nOriginal numbers remain, and new numbers are added.\n\nSo row0:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,9]\n\n row0 has 3 and 9.\n\nRow1:\n\n7 is original. Also, from row0's 3 down-right: row1,7.\n\nSo row1:7,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0.\n\nWait no. The 3 from row0,6 would propagate to row1,7.\n\nRow1's original is [7,0,...]. So the 7 is already there. Add 3 at column7.\n\nSo row1: [7,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: from row1's 7 down-right (7 is at column0). So row2:7 at1. Also, row0's 3 propagates to row2,8.\n\nSo row2: [0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow3: from row2's 7 at1 \u2192 7 at2. From row0's 3 \u2192 row3,9. Also, original 3 at3,6.\n\nSo row3: [0,0,7,3,0,0,9,0,0,3]\n\nRow4: from row3's 7 at2 \u21927 at3. From row0's 3 \u2192 row4,10 (invalid). From row3's 3 at3 \u21923 at4. From row3's 9 at6 \u21929 at7. Original 6 at0.\n\nSo row4: [6,0,0,7,3,0,0,9,0,0]\n\nRow5: from row4's 7 at3 \u21927 at4. From row3's 3 \u21923 at5. From row4's 9 at7 \u21929 at8. Original 4 at9.\n\nSo row5: [0,0,0,0,7,3,0,0,9,4]\n\nRow6: from row5's 7 at4 \u21927 at5. From row5's3 at5 \u21923 at6. From row5's9 at8 \u21929 at9. From row5's4 at9 \u21924 at8.\n\nSo row6: [0,0,0,0,0,7,3,0,4,9]\n\nRow7: from row6's7 at5 \u21927 at6. From row6's3 at6 \u21923 at7. From row6's4 at8 \u21924 at7. From row6's9 at9 \u21929 at10 (invalid). Original 6 at3,7 at6.\n\nSo row7: [0,0,0,6,0,0,7,4+3,0,0]\n\nWait, but 4 from row6,8 \u2192 row7,7. 3 from row6,6 \u2192 row7,7. So 7 and 4 and 3 at column7?\n\nBut according to the rules, multiple numbers could be in the same cell. But in the training examples, when numbers overlap, they might be summed or replaced. But in the training examples, in example0's output, the cells have only one number. So perhaps, when multiple numbers would be in the same cell, they are just placed there. But in the training examples, there's no case of overlapping numbers. So perhaps each number propagates in its own direction without overlapping.\n\nIn any case, I'll proceed.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow7's original 6 at3 and 7 at6.\n\nFrom row6's7 at5 \u21927 at6 (but already has 7). From row6's3 at6 \u21923 at7. From row6's4 at8 \u21924 at7. So row7: columns3=6,6=7,7=3+4 (but perhaps only one number is kept. The training examples don't show overlapping. So perhaps we only keep the original number. But this is unclear.\n\nThis is getting very complex. Given the time constraints, perhaps the pattern is that each non-zero number in the input creates a diagonal line in the output, moving down-right for numbers in even columns and down-left for odd columns. But example0's 6 is in column5 (odd) and moves down-right, which fits. Example1's 8 is in column6 (even) and moves down-left. So that fits. Example2's 6 is in column3 (odd) and moves down-left, which contradicts. So this is not correct.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll make a guess based on the majority of examples.\n\nIn most cases, even numbers move down-left and odd numbers down-right. But this is not consistent. However, let's proceed with this assumption for the test input.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nNumbers and their directions:\n\nRow0,6:3 (odd) \u2192 down-right.\n\nRow0,9:9 (odd) \u2192 down-right.\n\nRow1,0:7 (odd) \u2192 down-right.\n\nRow3,3:3 (odd) \u2192 down-right.\n\nRow3,6:9 (odd) \u2192 down-right.\n\nRow4,0:6 (even) \u2192 down-left.\n\nRow5,9:4 (even) \u2192 down-left.\n\nRow7,3:6 (even) \u2192 down-left.\n\nRow7,6:7 (odd) \u2192 down-right.\n\nRow9,5:4 (even) \u2192 down-left.\n\nNow, construct the output grid:\n\nStarting with the input as the base.\n\nRow0: 3 at6, 9 at9.\n\nRow1:7 at0, and 3 from row0's 3 at7.\n\nRow2:7 from row1's7 at1, and 3 from row0's3 at8.\n\nRow3:7 from row2's7 at2, original 3 at3, 9 at6, and 3 from row0's3 at9.\n\nRow4:7 from row3's7 at3, 3 from row3's3 at4, 9 from row3's9 at7, original6 at0.\n\nRow5:7 from row4's7 at4,3 from row4's3 at5,9 from row4's9 at8, original4 at9.\n\nRow6:7 from row5's7 at5,3 from row5's3 at6,9 from row5's9 at9,4 from row5's4 at8.\n\nRow7:7 from row6's7 at6,3 from row6's3 at7,4 from row6's4 at7 (conflict?), original6 at3 and7 at6.\n\nRow8:7 from row7's7 at7,6 from row7's6 at2, original nothing.\n\nRow9:7 from row8's7 at8,6 from row8's6 at1, original4 at5.\n\nBut this is very messy and likely incorrect. However, given the time, I'll proceed to format the answer based on the test input and the pattern observed in the examples, focusing on the direction of each number's propagation.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to figure out the transformation applied to the input matrices to get the output matrices in the training examples, and then apply the same pattern to the test input.\n\nLooking at the examples, each input is a 10x10 grid. The outputs have additional numbers filled in. Let's compare the input and output for each example to spot the pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some non-zero numbers: 2, 6, 4, etc. In the output, these numbers seem to spread diagonally. For instance, the 2 in the first row (third column) of the input is followed by a 2 in the next row, shifted one column to the left. Similarly, the 6 in the first row's sixth column leads to 6s moving down and to the left in subsequent rows. The same happens with the 4 in row 5, column 4 of the input\u2014it creates a diagonal line moving down-left in the output.\n\nExample 1 shows a similar pattern. The number 9 in the first row starts a diagonal that moves down and left. The 3 in the first row's eighth column also forms a diagonal going down-left. The 8 and 7 follow the same rule. So, it looks like any non-zero number in the input is part of a diagonal that starts at their position and continues downwards and to the left in each subsequent row.\n\nIn Example 2, the 6 in row 0, column 3 leads to a diagonal of 6s moving down-left. The 4 in row 2, column 2 creates a diagonal of 4s. The 8 in row 4, column 9 (but wait, how does that work? Maybe the direction is down-left, so from (4,9), moving down-left would go to (5,8), (6,7), etc. But looking at the output, maybe the direction is down and left, but perhaps wrapping around or a different rule. Hmm, in the input row 4 has 8 in column 9. In the output, row 4 ends with 8, and then row 5 has 4 in column 5. Wait, perhaps it's a different approach. Maybe each non-zero number in the input starts a diagonal that extends downwards and to the left, but only if the next position in that direction is zero. Or maybe the number propagates down and left, filling in those positions, replacing zeros but not overwriting existing numbers.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each non-zero number in the input, create a diagonal line moving down and to the left (row increases by 1, column decreases by 1 each step) until the end of the grid. Each subsequent cell in that diagonal gets the same number as the original. However, looking at the examples, sometimes other numbers are present. For example, in Example 0's output row 5 has a 4, which is part of the original input. So the diagonals don't interfere with existing non-zero numbers but fill the zeros along their path.\n\nSo the transformation rule is: For each cell (i,j) in the input that has a non-zero value, fill the cells (i+1,j-1), (i+2,j-2), ..., as long as the new cell is within the grid. If the cell in the path already has a non-zero number (from the input or another diagonal), leave it as is. So the original numbers are kept, and the diagonals are added.\n\nWait, but looking at Example 0's input row 5 column 3 is 4. In the output, starting from there, the 4 propagates down-left: rows 6 column 2, 7 column 1, 8 column 0? But in the output, row 6 column 4 is 0, but in the output example 0's output, row 5 has 4, then row6, column4? Wait, maybe I'm getting the direction wrong. Let me check.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 4 is at row 5, column 3 (0-based index). The output shows in row5: [0,0,0,4,0,...]. Then in row6, column4 is 4. Wait, that's moving down and to the right. Wait, no, row6's 4 is in column4, which is column3 +1. Hmm, that's the opposite of left. So maybe the direction is down and to the right?\n\nWait, that's conflicting with previous examples. Let me check Example 0 again. Let's list the input and output.\n\nOriginal input for Example 0:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,2,0,0,6,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,4,...]\n\nIn the output:\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]\n\nSo starting from row5, column3 (4), the next is row6, column4 (4), then row7, column5 (4), etc. So each step down increases the row by 1 and the column by 1. Wait, that's moving down and to the right. But in Example 0, the 2 in row0, column2 in the input leads to row1, column1 (2), then row2, column0 (2). So for 2, it's moving down-left. But for the 4, it's moving down-right. That contradicts.\n\nWait, this is confusing. How can different numbers have different directions? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's output:\n\nThe 2 in row0, column2: in row1, column1 (2), then row2, column0 (2). So each step is row+1, column-1. Direction is down-left.\n\nThe 6 in row0, column5: in row1, column6 (6), then row2, column7 (6), row3, column8 (6), row4, column9 (6). So here, direction is down-right (column increases by 1 each row). So the direction depends on the original number's position?\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. How would the direction be determined? Alternatively, maybe the direction alternates based on the number's parity or some other property. Or perhaps the direction is determined by some other factor.\n\nWait, the 2 in Example0's input is in row0, column2. In the output, the next 2 is row1, column1 (left), then row2, column0 (left). So down-left.\n\nThe 6 in row0, column5: in the output, next 6 is row1, column6 (right), then row2, column7 (right), etc. So down-right.\n\nSo same example has both down-left and down-right directions. How can that be? What determines the direction?\n\nLooking at the numbers: 2 and 6. Maybe even numbers go down-left and odd down-right? But 6 is even and it's going down-right. 2 is even and going down-left. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the original number's position. For example, numbers in the left half of the grid go down-right, and in the right half go down-left. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0, 2 is in column2 (0-based), which is in the left half (columns 0-4). But it's moving down-left. 6 is in column5 (right half) and moving down-right. So that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the original number's position: for each number, if it's in an even row, go down-left; if in odd row, down-right. But 2 is in row0 (even), and goes down-left. 6 is in row0 (even), but goes down-right. So that doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction alternates per number. For example, the first non-zero number in the grid (scanning left to right, top to bottom) starts moving down-right, the next down-left, etc. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction is determined by the number itself. For example, even numbers go down-left, odd down-right. But 6 is even and goes down-right. 2 is even and goes down-left. So that's not consistent.\n\nWait, maybe the direction is determined by the number's parity. For example, numbers that are multiples of 3 go down-right, others down-left. 6 is a multiple of 3 (6/3=2), so it goes down-right. 2 isn't, so down-left. Let's check example1:\n\nIn example1, the input has 9, 3, 8, 7. The 9 in row0, column0. In the output, it propagates down-right: row1, column1 (9), row2, column2 (9), etc. So 9 is a multiple of 3 (9/3=3), so direction down-right. The 3 in row0, column7. 3 is a multiple of 3, so direction down-right. Let's see: in output row0 has 3 at column7. Then row1, column8 (3). Then row2, column9 (3). That's correct. The 8 in row2, column6 of input (original input row2, column6 is 8). 8 isn't a multiple of 3. So it should go down-left. Let's see the output for 8: in input row2, column6 is 8. Output row3, column5 (8?), looking at example1's output:\n\nExample1's output:\n\nRow2: [0,0,9,0,0,0,8,0,0,3]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,9,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo 8 is in row3, column5. Then row4, column4: 8? Let's see row4 in output is [0,0,0,0,8,0...]. So yes. Then row5, column3 (8). Row6, column2 (7?), no. Wait, example1's output for 8 in row2, column6 (input). The output row3, column5 (8), row4, column4 (8), row5, column3 (8), row6, column2 (7?), but in the output, row6 has 7 in column6? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the 8 in row2, column6 (input) in example1 is part of a diagonal that goes down-left. So from row2, column6: next is row3, column5 (8), then row4, column4 (8), row5, column3 (8), etc. Yes, that's the case. So 8 is moving down-left, even though 8 isn't a multiple of 3. But earlier, 9 (multiple of 3) went down-right, 3 (multiple) down-right. Hmm, this breaks the previous idea. So perhaps the direction isn't based on the number's value.\n\nAlternative approach: look for the direction each number takes. For example, in Example0:\n\n- 2 in (0,2) goes down-left (rows 1,1; 2,0)\n- 6 in (0,5) goes down-right (rows 1,6; 2,7; 3,8; 4,9)\n- 4 in (5,3) goes down-right (rows 6,4;7,5;8,6;9,7)\n\nWait, but in example0's output, the 4 in row5, column3 is followed by 4 in row6, column4 (5+1=6, 3+1=4), then row7, column5, etc. So direction is down-right.\n\nBut the 2 in row0, column2 is followed by row1, column1 (down-left), then row2, column0 (down-left). So direction varies per number.\n\nWhat's the pattern here? How to determine for each number whether it propagates down-left or down-right?\n\nLooking at the input positions:\n\nFor example0:\n\n- 2 is in column2 of row0. The direction is down-left. Starting from (0,2), next (1,1), (2,0).\n\nBut 6 is in column5 of row0, and propagates down-right: (0,5) \u2192 (1,6), (2,7), (3,8), (4,9).\n\n4 is in row5, column3. Then propagates down-right: (5,3) \u2192 (6,4), (7,5), (8,6), (9,7).\n\nSo, perhaps the direction is determined based on the original column position. For even columns, down-left; for odd columns, down-right? Let's check:\n\n- 2 is in column2 (even), direction down-left. Correct.\n- 6 is in column5 (odd), direction down-right. Correct.\n- 4 is in column3 (odd), direction down-right. Correct.\n\nBut in example1:\n\n9 is in column0 (even) of row0. Its direction is down-right: (0,0) \u2192 (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), etc. So for even column, direction is down-right. But in example0, even column (2) had down-left. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm, so that theory is invalid.\n\nAlternative idea: the direction depends on whether the original number is in the left half or right half of the grid. Since the grid has 10 columns (0-9), left half is 0-4, right half is 5-9.\n\nIn example0:\n\n- 2 is in column2 (left half) \u2192 down-left.\n- 6 is column5 (right half) \u2192 down-right.\n- 4 is column3 (left half) \u2192 but in the output, 4 in row5, column3 propagates down-right, which would be right half. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the direction alternates based on whether the column is less than the row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the parity of the row. For even rows, numbers go down-right; odd rows, down-left. Let's check:\n\nIn example0:\n\n- 2 is in row0 (even). If even rows go down-right, but in this case, 2 goes down-left. So that's not.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's look at another example.\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,6,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nIn the output:\n\nRow0: same as input.\n\nRow1: [0,0,6,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,6,4,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow3: [6,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,8]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,9,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,9,0,0,4,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLet's track some numbers:\n\n- The 6 in row0, column3 (input). In the output, it's followed by row1, column2 (6), row2, column1 (6), row3, column0 (6). So direction is down-left (row increases, column decreases).\n\n- The 8 in row0, column5. In output, row1, column6 (8), row2, column7 (8), row3, column8 (8), row4, column9 (8). So down-right.\n\n- The 4 in row2, column2. Output: row3, column3 (4), row4, column4 (4), row5, column5 (4), etc. So down-right.\n\n- The 9 in row5, column4 (input). Output: row6, column5 (9?), no. Wait, row5's input is [0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]. In output, row5 is [0,0,0,0,9,4,0,0,0,0]. Then row6: [0,0,0,9,0,0,4,0,0,0]. So 9 is in row5, column4. Then row6, column3 (9), row7, column2 (9), row8, column1 (9), row9, column0 (9). So direction is down-left.\n\nWait, that's down-left. So 9 is in column4 (left half), and direction is down-left. But in example0, 6 was in column5 (right half), direction down-right. Hmm, maybe the rule is that numbers in even columns go down-left, odd columns go down-right. Let's check:\n\n- In example2, 6 is in row0, column3 (odd) \u2192 down-left. But according to the even/odd column idea, odd should be down-right. Contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is based on whether the column is less than 5 (left half) or >=5 (right half). So:\n\n- Numbers in columns 0-4 (left half) propagate down-left.\n\n- Numbers in columns 5-9 (right half) propagate down-right.\n\nLet's check example0:\n\n- 2 is in column2 (left) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n- 6 is in column5 (right) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n- 4 is in column3 (left) \u2192 down-right in example0's output. Wait, no. Wait in example0's output, the 4 in row5, column3 (left half) propagates down-right. But according to this rule, left half should down-left. But in example0's output, the 4 propagates down-right. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let's look at example1:\n\nIn example1, the 9 is in column0 (left). It propagates down-right: row0,0 \u2192 row1,1 \u2192 row2,2 \u2192 etc. So according to the left/right rule, left should go down-left, but this is going down-right. So the rule doesn't hold.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the direction is determined by the original number's position in such a way that if a number is in the upper half of the grid, it propagates down-right, and if in the lower half, down-left. But how to define upper and lower.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all numbers propagate down-right, but the example0's 2 is an exception. Wait, no, because in example0, the 2 is moving down-left, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the number's value. For example, numbers less than 5 go down-left, numbers >=5 go down-right. Let's check:\n\nExample0:\n\n2 (less than 5) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n6 (>=5) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n4 (less than 5) \u2192 in example0's output, the 4 propagates down-right. Contradicts.\n\nSo that theory is invalid.\n\nHmm. Let's take a step back. Looking for another pattern. In example0's output, each non-zero in the input has a diagonal in the output. For instance, 2 in (0,2) leads to 2 in (1,1), (2,0). Similarly, 6 in (0,5) leads to 6 in (1,6), (2,7), (3,8), (4,9). The 4 in (5,3) leads to 4 in (6,4), (7,5), (8,6), (9,7). So, for each number, starting at (i,j), the diagonal continues by adding 1 to row and adding 1 to column (down-right) OR adding 1 to row and subtracting 1 from column (down-left). So why the difference in direction?\n\nMaybe the direction depends on the initial position's row and column. For example, if j is even, down-left; if j is odd, down-right. Let's check:\n\nExample0's 2 at (0,2) \u2192 j=2 (even) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n6 at (0,5) \u2192 j=5 (odd) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n4 at (5,3) \u2192 j=3 (odd) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\nIn example1:\n\n9 at (0,0) \u2192 j=0 even \u2192 down-left. But in the output, it's propagating down-right. So this theory is invalid.\n\nWait, but in example1's output, the 9 starts at (0,0) and propagates to (1,1), (2,2), etc. That's down-right. So j=0 even, but direction is down-right. So this contradicts.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the direction is determined by the sum of the row and column indices. If even, down-left; if odd, down-right. Let's check:\n\nExample0's 2 at (0,2) \u2192 sum 0+2=2 (even) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n6 at (0,5) \u2192 sum 0+5=5 (odd) \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n4 at (5,3) \u2192 sum 5+3=8 (even) \u2192 down-left. But in example0's output, it's down-right. So invalid.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if the row index is even, down-right; else down-left. Let's check:\n\nExample0's 2 is in row0 (even) \u2192 down-right, but it's moving down-left. So no.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe the direction is not fixed for a given cell, but instead depends on some other factor. Let's look at all examples again.\n\nIn Example0's output, the diagonals for 2 and 6 are in opposite directions. For 2, down-left, for 6, down-right. The 4 is down-right.\n\nIn Example1, the 9 (from row0, column0) propagates down-right, 3 (row0, column7) down-right, 8 (row2, column6) down-left, 7 (row9, column9) down-right.\n\nWait, the 8 in example1's input is in row2, column6. In output, it propagates down-left. So row2 is even, column6 is even. So sum 8 even. But direction down-left.\n\nThe 7 in example1's input is in row9, column9. Sum 18 even. It propagates down-right (but since row9 is the last row, it can't go further. So the 7 remains in row9, column9).\n\nThis isn't helping.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the direction alternates between down-left and down-right for each subsequent number in the input. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the parity of the number's value. Even numbers go down-left, odd down-right. Let's check:\n\nExample0:\n\n2 (even) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n6 (even) \u2192 down-right. Incorrect.\n\nSo no.\n\nAlternatively, numbers that are multiples of 3 go down-right, others down-left. Let's see:\n\n6 is a multiple of 3 \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n3 in example1 is multiple of 3 \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n8 is not \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n7 is not \u2192 down-right. Wait, in example1's input, 7 is in row9, column9. Output: it stays there. So no propagation.\n\nBut in example1's output, the 7 in row9, column9 is part of a diagonal from row5, column5 (7 in input row5, column5 is 7. But no, example1's input for row5 is [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0]. So 7 is in row5, column5. In the output, it propagates down-right: row6, column6 (7), row7, column7 (7), row8, column8 (7), row9, column9 (7). So yes. So 7 is not a multiple of 3, but direction is down-right. So this theory is invalid.\n\nHmm. Maybe the direction is always down-right for all numbers. But why does the 2 in example0 go down-left?\n\nWait, perhaps the direction is determined by the row. For example, even rows propagate down-right, odd rows down-left. Let's check:\n\nExample0's 2 is in row0 (even) \u2192 down-right. But in example0, the 2 is moving down-left. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is down-right for all numbers except those in the first half of the grid. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction is down-left for numbers in the left side of the grid and down-right for the right. But how to define left and right.\n\nLet's think differently. Maybe each number in the input is the start of a diagonal that extends in both directions (down-left and down-right). But looking at the examples, that's not the case. Each number propagates in only one direction.\n\nWait, example0's 2 propagates down-left, and the 6 propagates down-right. So maybe the direction is chosen such that the diagonal can fit within the grid. For example, if the number is in a position where propagating down-left would go out of bounds, then it goes down-right. Or vice versa.\n\nFor example, the 2 in row0, column2. If it goes down-left, it can propagate two steps (rows1 and 2) before column becomes -1. But in the output, it propagates exactly two steps. The 6 in row0, column5: if it goes down-right, it can propagate four steps (columns6,7,8,9) until column9. So that's four steps. Which matches the output.\n\nSimilarly, the 4 in row5, column3. Propagating down-right, it can go to column6,7,8,9 (rows6,7,8,9). So four steps, which matches the output.\n\nSo the direction is determined by whether propagating in down-left or down-right allows the diagonal to fit within the grid. The algorithm chooses the direction that allows the longest possible diagonal. For example, 2 in (0,2): down-left would allow 2 steps (column2 \u21921,0), down-right would allow columns2\u21923,4,5,6,7,8,9 (7 steps). But in example0's output, the 2 propagates down-left. So that theory is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is always down-left for even rows and down-right for odd rows. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at the outputs:\n\nIn example0's output, the 2 and 6 from the input each start a diagonal, and the 4 from the input starts another diagonal. All diagonals are filled with the same number as the starting cell. Additionally, any existing zeros along the diagonal path are filled with the number, but existing non-zero numbers (from input or other diagonals) are left intact.\n\nSo the rule is: for each non-zero number in the input grid, propagate its value along the diagonal in a specific direction (either down-left or down-right), filling the cells with the same number, but not overwriting existing numbers. The key is to determine the direction for each cell.\n\nAfter struggling with the examples, I notice that in example0, the 2 is in row0, column2. The diagonal extends down-left (rows increase, columns decrease). The 6 is in row0, column5, and extends down-right (rows and columns increase). The 4 in row5, column3 extends down-right.\n\nIn example1, the 9 in row0, column0 extends down-right. The 3 in row0, column7 extends down-right. The 8 in row2, column6 extends down-left. The 7 in row5, column5 extends down-right.\n\nIn example2, the 6 in row0, column3 extends down-left. The 8 in row0, column5 extends down-right. The 4 in row2, column2 extends down-right. The 9 in row5, column4 extends down-left.\n\nHmm. It seems that the direction is determined by the column's position relative to the center. For example, columns 0-4 (left half) go down-left, columns5-9 (right half) go down-right. But in example0, the 4 is in column3 (left half), but it extends down-right. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is down-right for all numbers except those that are in the leftmost half of the grid. But example0's 2 is in column2 (left half), and goes down-left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction is chosen based on which direction allows the diagonal to reach the end of the grid. For example, the 2 in row0, column2: down-left would allow two steps before column becomes negative, down-right would allow 7 steps. But in the output, it's down-left. So this theory is not.\n\nAlternatively, the direction is down-right for all numbers. But why the 2 in example0 is down-left.\n\nWait, maybe the examples have different rules. Maybe each number's direction is determined by some other hidden rule, like the sum of their row and column indices modulo something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction is down-right for even numbers and down-left for odd numbers. But 2 is even and goes down-left. 6 is even and goes down-right. So no.\n\nAnother approach: let's see what's common between the directions chosen in the examples.\n\nIn example0, 2 (row0, column2) \u2192 down-left.\n\nIn example2, 6 in row0, column3 \u2192 down-left.\n\nWait, example2's input row0, column3 is 6. In output, row1, column2 is 6, row2, column1 is 6, row3, column0 is 6. So down-left.\n\nBut why is this direction chosen here?\n\nSimilarly, example2's row0, column5 (8) propagates down-right.\n\nHmm. Maybe the direction is down-left for columns 0-4 and down-right for columns5-9. Let's check:\n\nExample0:\n\n2 in column2 \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n6 in column5 \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n4 in column3 \u2192 down-right. But column3 is in 0-4, so should go down-left. Contradicts.\n\nExample2's 6 in column3 (0-4) \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\nThe 8 in column5 \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\nThe 4 in column2 (0-4) \u2192 down-right. Contradicts.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that this isn't the correct pattern.\n\nMaybe the direction is determined by the number's value. For example, if the number is divisible by 2 but not by 3, direction is down-left; if divisible by 3, down-right. Let's see:\n\nExample0's 2: not divisible by 3 \u2192 down-left. Correct.\n\n6: divisible by 3 \u2192 down-right. Correct.\n\n4: not divisible by 3 \u2192 down-left. But in example0, it's down-right. So incorrect.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck trying to find the direction rule. Maybe I should look for another pattern. \n\nAnother observation: in the output grids, each non-zero from the input is the start of a diagonal, and these diagonals overlap with other numbers. For example, in example1's output, the 9's diagonal overlaps with the 3's diagonal. The 8's diagonal is separate. The 7's diagonal is separate.\n\nWait, perhaps each number's diagonal is moving down and to the right (row+1, column+1), but when that would go out of bounds, it wraps around or stops. But example0's 2 is moving down-left, which contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is down-right for all numbers, but some examples show overlapping numbers from other diagonals. No, because in example0's 2 is moving down-left.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's look at the test input and see if applying any of the possible patterns helps.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 9]\n[7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n[6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLooking for non-zero entries in the input:\n\n- Row0: 3 at column6, 9 at column9.\n\n- Row1:7 at column0.\n\n- Row3:3 at column3, 9 at column6.\n\n- Row4:6 at column0.\n\n- Row5:4 at column9.\n\n- Row7:6 at column3,7 at column6.\n\n- Row9:4 at column5.\n\nSo for each of these, need to determine the direction of propagation.\n\nFor example, row0's 3 is at column6. If direction is down-right, then next would be row1, column7 (0 in input), then row2, column8, etc. But in the output examples, such as example0, numbers in column5 (right half) propagate down-right.\n\nSo perhaps 3 in column6 (right half) propagates down-right.\n\nSimilarly, 9 in column9 (rightmost) would propagate down-right, but since it's already at column9, it can't go further right. So the 9 in row0, column9 would stay as is.\n\nRow1's 7 at column0 (leftmost) would propagate down-left? But down-left would go to column -1, which is invalid. So perhaps it propagates down-right.\n\nRow3's 3 at column3 (left half) \u2192 down-left.\n\nRow3's 9 at column6 (right half) \u2192 down-right.\n\nRow4's 6 at column0 (left) \u2192 down-left, but column0 can't decrease further. So maybe down-right.\n\nRow5's 4 at column9 (right) \u2192 down-right, but column9 can't increase. So no propagation.\n\nRow7's 6 at column3 (left) \u2192 down-left.\n\nRow7's7 at column6 (right) \u2192 down-right.\n\nRow9's4 at column5 (right) \u2192 down-right.\n\nSo, applying this:\n\nLet's process each non-zero input:\n\n1. Row0, column6: 3 (right half) \u2192 down-right.\n\nPropagate 3 to row1,7; row2,8; row3,9. But row3's column9 in the input is 0, so filled with 3. But in the input row3, column6 has 9. So row3,9 would be 3, but row3's input also has 9 at column6. But 9's propagation is separate.\n\n2. Row0, column9:9 (right half) \u2192 down-right. But column9 can't increase, so no propagation.\n\n3. Row1, column0:7 (left) \u2192 down-left (column-1 invalid, so perhaps down-right instead. Or since column0 is left, down-right. For example1's row0, column0 9 propagated down-right. So for row1, column0's 7, down-right. So next rows: row2, column1 (7), row3, column2 (7), etc.\n\n4. Row3, column3:3 (left) \u2192 down-left. So row4, column2; row5, column1; row6, column0.\n\n5. Row3, column6:9 (right) \u2192 down-right. row4,7; row5,8; row6,9.\n\n6. Row4, column0:6 (left) \u2192 down-left. But column0 can't go left, so maybe down-right. For example, row5,1; row6,2; row7,3; etc.\n\n7. Row5, column9:4 (right) \u2192 down-right. column9 can't increase, so no propagation.\n\n8. Row7, column3:6 (left) \u2192 down-left. So row8,2; row9,1.\n\n9. Row7, column6:7 (right) \u2192 down-right. row8,7; row9,8.\n\n10. Row9, column5:4 (right) \u2192 down-right. row10 is beyond, so no.\n\nNow, let's try to build the output step by step.\n\nStart with the test input grid, then add the propagated numbers.\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,9]\n\nRow1: [7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,3,0,0,9,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nNow, processing each non-zero:\n\n1. Row0,6:3 (down-right):\n\n- Row1,7:3 (original is 0 \u2192 set to3.\n\n- Row2,8:3.\n\n- Row3,9:3. But row3's input has 9 at column6, but column9 is 0, so set to3.\n\n2. Row0,9:9 (no propagation).\n\n3. Row1,0:7 (down-right):\n\n- Row2,1:7.\n\n- Row3,2:7.\n\n- Row4,3:7.\n\n- Row5,4:7.\n\n- Row6,5:7.\n\n- Row7,6:7. But row7,6 is already 7 (input). So no change.\n\n- Continue to row8,7:7.\n\n- Row9,8:7.\n\n4. Row3,3:3 (down-left):\n\n- Row4,2:3.\n\n- Row5,1:3.\n\n- Row6,0:3.\n\n5. Row3,6:9 (down-right):\n\n- Row4,7:9.\n\n- Row5,8:9.\n\n- Row6,9:9. But row5's column9 is 4 (input) \u2192 remains 4. So row6,9 would be9 (if original is0).\n\n6. Row4,0:6 (down-right):\n\n- Row5,1:6.\n\n- Row6,2:6.\n\n- Row7,3:6. But row7,3 is already6 (input). So no change.\n\n- Row8,4:6.\n\n- Row9,5:6. But row9,5 is4 (input). So remains4.\n\n7. Row5,9:4 (no propagation).\n\n8. Row7,3:6 (down-left):\n\n- Row8,2:6.\n\n- Row9,1:6.\n\n9. Row7,6:7 (down-right):\n\n- Row8,7:7.\n\n- Row9,8:7.\n\n10. Row9,5:4 (down-right): no.\n\nNow, let's construct the output grid step by step.\n\nOriginal input as base, then add the propagated numbers:\n\nRow0 remains: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,9]\n\nRow1: [7,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,7,3,0,0,9,0,0,3]\n\nRow4: [6,0,3,0,0,0,0,9,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,3,0,0,7,0,0,0,9,4]\n\nRow6: [3,0,6,0,0,7,0,0,0,9]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,6,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,0]\n\nRow9: [6,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,7,0]\n\nWait, this is a possible output based on the directions assumed. But I'm not sure if this matches the pattern from the examples. Let's compare with the training examples.\n\nFor example, in Example0, the 6 in row0, column5 propagates down-right, adding 6 to row1,6; row2,7; etc. Similarly, the 3 in the test input's row0,6 would propagate down-right to row1,7; row2,8; row3,9.\n\nThe 7 in row1,0 would propagate down-right: row2,1; row3,2; etc.\n\nThe 3 in row3,3 would propagate down-left: row4,2; row5,1; row6,0.\n\nThe 9 in row3,6 would propagate down-right: row4,7; row5,8; row6,9.\n\nThe 6 in row4,0 propagates down-right: row5,1; row6,2; row7,3 (existing 6), etc.\n\nThe 6 in row7,3 propagates down-left: row8,2; row9,1.\n\nThe 7 in row7,6 propagates down-right: row8,7; row9,8.\n\nPutting this all together, the output grid would have these additions.\n\nBut need to ensure that existing numbers are not overwritten. For example, row3's column6 has 9 (input), and the propagation from row0's 3 adds 3 at row3,9.\n\nThis seems plausible. Now, let's format the final answer in the same style as the training examples.",
