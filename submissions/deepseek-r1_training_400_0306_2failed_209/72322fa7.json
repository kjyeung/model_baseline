        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a grid of numbers, and the output is another grid. My job is to find out how the input is transformed into the output and apply that to the test input.\n\nStarting with Example 0. Let's compare the input and output. The input has some 0s, 3, 8, 6, etc. The output seems to have some changes around those numbers. For instance, in the input, there's a 3 in the second row. In the output, the rows above and below the 3 have 1s around it. Wait, looking at row 0 in the input, it's all zeros, but in the output, row 0 has [...,1,0,1,...]. Maybe the 3 is acting as a center and adding 1s diagonally around it? Like creating a diamond pattern?\n\nIn Example 0's input, the row with 3 is [0,0,...,3,0...], and in the output, the rows above and below have 1s in positions adjacent to the 3. Similarly, looking at the 8s and 6s. For example, in the input's fourth row, there's 8,6,8. In the output, that row becomes the same, but the row below (row 5) has 8,6,8 shifted to the right, maybe expanding? Or perhaps it's mirroring or expanding in a certain way.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input row 5 has a 6 in position 19. The output row 5 has 8,6,8 in positions 18,19,20. So maybe when there's a 6, it's surrounded by 8s? Or maybe numbers are being replaced based on their neighbors.\n\nAnother example: Example 1. The input has a 4,8,4 in a row. In the output, that same row remains, but the row below (row 4) ends with 4,8,4. Also, in the input row 9, there's 4,0,4, which becomes 4,8,4 in the output. So maybe 4s with a 0 in between become 4,8,4. Similarly, 8s might be generated between 4s. \n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has a 3 in the fifth row, fourth column. The output adds 1s around it? Not sure. Wait, in Example 2's input, there's a row with 8,0,8 which becomes 8,2,8 in the output. Oh, so maybe if there's an 8 with a 0 in between, it's replaced with 2. Or maybe the 0 is replaced by a number based on adjacent numbers. Alternatively, maybe numbers are being \"mirrored\" or extended in certain directions.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each number in the input is replaced by a certain pattern. For example, 3 becomes a diamond of 1s around it. 8 might create 8s in adjacent cells. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, the 3 in the input is at position (1,13). The output has 1s in positions (0,12), (0,14), (2,12), (2,14). So a diamond shape around the 3, replacing zeros with 1s. Similarly, for the 6 in the input, which is in the middle of 8s. In the output, the 6 remains, but the 8s around it expand. Maybe each number has a certain \"radius\" of influence where they add their own numbers around them.\n\nIn Example 1, the 4,8,4 in the input remains the same in the output, but then there's a 4,8,4 added in row 4 at the end. Also, the row 9's 4,0,4 becomes 4,8,4. So replacing the 0 between 4s with 8.\n\nLooking at the test input, there's a 3,7,3 in the second row. Maybe the 7 is a new number. If 3 creates 1s around it, maybe 7 creates something else. Let's see what other numbers do. In Example 2, there's a 2 in the input. The output adds 8s around it. For instance, the input has a 2 in position (11,5), and in the output, the row 11 becomes 8,2,8. So 2 is surrounded by 8s. Similarly, 4 might generate 4s around it. \n\nSo maybe each number generates a certain pattern around itself, replacing zeros with lower numbers. Let's hypothesize:\n\n- 1: Maybe doesn't generate anything, but maybe is part of a diamond from a 3.\n- 3: Generates 1s in a diamond pattern around it.\n- 4: Generates 4s in adjacent cells?\nWait in Example 1, the 4s in row 9 (input) are 4,0,4. Output is 4,8,4. So perhaps when two 4s are adjacent (with a zero in between), they turn the zero into an 8. Or maybe 4s generate 8s between them. Alternatively, maybe 4s are part of a pattern that when they are next to each other, or spaced by one, they create 8s.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the transformation involves looking for numbers and creating a cross or diamond around them. For example, 3 adds 1s diagonally around it, 8 adds 8s adjacent, etc.\n\nLooking at the test input, there's a 7. Since 3 and 7 are present, maybe 7 is a higher number that creates a larger pattern. For example, 3 creates 1s in a diamond, 7 might create 3s or another number. Alternatively, 7 could be the sum of 3 and 4, and the pattern combines those.\n\nAlternatively, maybe numbers are being \"expanded\" into cross shapes. For example, a 3 could expand into a cross of 1s. Let's check Example 0 again. The 3 in input's row 1, column 13. Output adds 1s in positions (0,12), (0,14), (2,12), (2,14), which are diagonally adjacent. So a diamond shape. Then, the 6 in the input (row 4, column 6) is surrounded by 8s. The output row 4 has 8,6,8, which is the same as input. But row 5 in input has 8 in column 6, and in output, that row has 8,6,8 shifted to the right. Hmm, maybe when a 6 is present, it's part of a structure that extends. Alternatively, the 8s might be part of a diamond expansion.\n\nAnother thought: The patterns could be based on cellular automata rules, where each cell looks at its neighbors and changes based on certain rules. For example, if a cell has a number, it influences adjacent cells to become certain values.\n\nLet's try to list possible rules based on the examples:\n\n- When a 3 is present, add 1s diagonally around it (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).\n- When an 8 is present, add 8s in adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)?\nWait, in Example 0's input, there's an 8 in row 3, column 6. In the output, that 8 remains, but in the next row (row 4), there are 8s around it. So maybe 8s cause adjacent cells to become 8s if they are zero. But in the input row 4, the 8s are already present, so maybe the 8s expand in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 1's input: In row 3, the 4,8,4. In the output, row 4 has 4,8,4 added at the end. So maybe the 8 in the middle is causing the 4s to spread downward. But I'm not sure.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has an 8 in row 3, column 8 and 10. The output changes the 0 between them to 2. So 8 and 8 with a zero in between becomes 2? That might be a specific rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe certain combinations of numbers generate other numbers. For example, two 8s with a zero between them become a 2. In Example 2's input row 3, [8,0,8] becomes [8,2,8], so inserting a 2. Similarly, in Example 1, the 4,0,4 becomes 4,8,4. So inserting an 8 between 4s. So maybe the rule is: if two identical numbers (non-zero) are separated by a single zero, replace the zero with a number that's the average or sum, or a specific value. For example, two 4s with a 0 become 4,8,4. Two 8s with a 0 become 8,2,8. That seems possible.\n\nSo rule 1: If two identical non-zero numbers are separated by a single zero, replace the zero with a specific number. For example:\n\n- 4 and 4 with 0 in between \u2192 8\n- 8 and 8 with 0 in between \u2192 2\n- 3 and 3 with 0 \u2192 maybe another number, but not seen in examples.\n\nThen, another rule could be for individual numbers. For instance, a 3 adds 1s in diagonal positions. A 7, which is new in the test input, might have a different rule. Since 7 is not in the training examples, need to infer.\n\nBut the test input has a 3,7,3 in a row. According to the previous possible rule, if 3 and 3 are separated by a 7, maybe not applicable. But perhaps the 7 itself is part of a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, numbers could have \"levels\" where higher numbers affect more cells. For example, a 3 might add 1s in a 1-cell radius, a 7 might add something in a larger radius.\n\nAlternatively, numbers could be primes or have other properties, but that's unclear.\n\nLooking back at the test input, there's a line with 3,7,3. Maybe the 7 is between two 3s. If 3's pattern is to add 1s diagonally, maybe 7's pattern is different. But since there's no training data on 7, need to guess based on the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by expanding each number into a certain shape. For instance:\n\n- 3 becomes a diamond of 1s.\n- 8 becomes a cross of 8s.\n- 4 becomes a square or horizontal line of 4s.\n- 2 becomes surrounded by 8s.\n- 6 is in the middle of 8s.\n- 7, being new, might create a larger pattern.\n\nWait, in the test input's second row, there's 3,7,3. Let's see the output. If 3 generates 1s around it, and 7 does something else. Maybe 7 is a higher number that combines the patterns of 3 and 4? Or perhaps 7 generates a different number like 5 or 7s around it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a cross or plus shape around each number. For example:\n\n- 3 \u2192 1s in a cross (up, down, left, right)\n- 8 \u2192 8s in the cross directions\nBut looking at example 0, the 3 in row 1, column 13. The output adds 1s diagonally, not in cross directions. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. Example 0's 3 adds 1s diagonally. Example 2's 2 in input becomes 8,2,8. So 2 is flanked by 8s. Similarly, the test input's 7 could be flanked by something. Since 7 is new, maybe the pattern is that higher numbers are surrounded by lower ones. For example, 7 could be surrounded by 3s. Or maybe the numbers around 7 are derived by subtracting 4 (since 3 +4=7?), but this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, each number's pattern is determined by its value. For example, number N creates a cross or diamond of N-2 or something. But 3 would create 1s (3-2=1), 8 would create 6s (8-2=6), but in example 0, 8s are present in the output next to the 6. So maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for changes in the test input and see what might happen.\n\nTest input highlights:\n\nRow 1: [...,3,7,3,...]. How to handle 7? Maybe 7 is replaced by something, and the 3s around it generate their patterns.\n\nRow 7: [...,2,0,0]. Row 8: [...,2,4,2]. So perhaps the 4 in row 8, column 16 is part of a pattern. Maybe 4 generates 4s in adjacent cells?\n\nRow 10: 8 in column 1 and 7 in column 9. The 7 might generate something around it.\n\nRow 15: [...,2,0,2,0...], which might become 2,8,2 if following the pattern from example 2 (8 between 2s).\n\nRow 16: [...,4,0,0...]. Maybe 4 generates 8s around it.\n\nBut without training examples for 7 and 4, it's tricky. Maybe the rules are:\n\n- For any number N, replace zeros in adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, diagonals) with N-1 or something. But 3 would add 2s, but in example 0, 3 adds 1s. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, each number N creates a diamond pattern of 1s at a distance equal to N. For example, 3 adds 1s three cells away. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, in example 0, the 3 in row 1, column 13. The 1s in the output are at (0,12), (0,14), (2,12), (2,14). So one cell away diagonally. So distance of 1. So maybe each number N creates a diamond of 1s at distance 1. But then why 3? Maybe the number itself doesn't matter, but the pattern is fixed based on the number's presence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number creates a specific shape:\n\n- 3 \u2192 diamond of 1s\n- 8 \u2192 horizontal and vertical 8s\n- 4 \u2192 horizontal line of 4s\n- 2 \u2192 surrounded by 8s\n- 6 \u2192 surrounded by 8s (as in example 0)\n\nIn test input, the 7 could be a new number, but since there's no example, maybe it's treated as a 7, but how? Or perhaps 7 is a sum of 3 and 4, but again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 7 could generate a cross of 3s. For example, in the test input's row 1, the 3,7,3 could expand such that the 7 is replaced by something else, and the 3s generate their diamond patterns. But this is a guess.\n\nAnother idea: The transformation might be that each number in the input creates a \"structure\" around it in the output. For instance, 3 creates a diamond of 1s, 8 creates a cross of 8s, and so on. The key is to identify which number creates which structure.\n\nIn example 0:\n\n- The 3 in the input leads to 1s diagonally around it.\n- The 8 in row 3, column 6 leads to 8s in adjacent rows, like forming a vertical line. In the output row 3: [8,0...], row 4: [8,6,8], row5: [8,0...]. So maybe the 8s form a vertical line with 8s above and below. But in this case, row 3 has an 8, row4 has 8,6,8, and row5 has 8. So maybe 8s are part of a vertical structure.\n\nAlternatively, the 6 in row4 is between two 8s. So 6 could be in the middle of a horizontal line of 8s.\n\nAnother observation: In example 0's output, the 6 is surrounded by 8s. So 6 might be a center point that requires 8s around it. Like 6 is a special number that needs to be enclosed by 8s.\n\nIn example 2's input, there's an 8 in row 3, columns 8 and 10 (with a 0 in between). The output replaces the 0 with a 2. So two 8s with a 0 become 8,2,8.\n\nSimilarly, in example 1's input, two 4s with a 0 become 4,8,4.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: if two identical numbers (non-zero) are separated by a single zero, replace the zero with a specific number based on the original numbers. For example:\n\n- 4 and 4 \u2192 8 in between\n- 8 and 8 \u2192 2 in between\n- 3 and 3 \u2192 maybe 6 in between (but not seen in examples)\n- 7 and 7 \u2192 ?\n\nThis seems like a possible pattern.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nLooking for pairs of identical numbers separated by a single zero.\n\nFor instance, in row 1 of the test input: [3,7,3]. The 3s are separated by a 7, not a zero, so no change here.\n\nIn row 7: [...,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. No pairs here.\n\nRow 8: [...,2,4,2]. The 2s are separated by a 4, so no.\n\nRow 15: [...,0,2,0,2,0]. Here, two 2s separated by a zero. According to the pattern, two 2s with a zero between them would become 2, x, 2, where x depends on the number. But we haven't seen 2s in training. In example 2, a single 2 became surrounded by 8s, but that's different.\n\nWait in example 2's input, there's a 2 in row 1, column 16 (part of 8,2,8). In the output, it remains the same. But in another part, a single 2 in row 11, column5 becomes surrounded by 8s. So maybe a single 2 is flanked by 8s, but if two 2s are separated by a zero, maybe the zero becomes something else.\n\nAlternatively, in the test input's row 15: the two 2s are separated by a zero. If following the previous pattern, maybe the zero becomes 8. So 2,0,2 \u2192 2,8,2.\n\nRow 16: [...,4,0,0...]. If there's a 4 followed by zeros, maybe if there's another 4 after a zero, it would become 8. But here, it's 4 followed by two zeros and then a 0. Not sure.\n\nAnother part of the test input: row 10 has 8 and 7 separated by zeros. Not sure.\n\nThe test input also has a 7. Since 7 isn't present in the training examples, we need to infer. Maybe 7 follows a similar rule as other numbers. For example, two 7s with a zero would turn into 7, x,7. But since there's only one 7, maybe it generates a certain pattern around it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 7 is a combination of previous numbers. Like 3 +4=7. So maybe the 7's pattern is a combination of 3 and 4's patterns. But this is speculative.\n\nAnother approach: For each number in the input, look in all directions (up, down, left, right, diagonals) and add certain numbers based on the original. For example, the 3 adds 1s in the diagonal directions, the 8 adds 8s in the cross directions, etc.\n\nPutting this together, the steps to transform the input to output might be:\n\n1. For each cell in the input grid:\n   a. If the cell is non-zero, apply its specific pattern to the output grid.\n   b. Patterns are as follows:\n      - 3: Place 1s in the four diagonal cells (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).\n      - 8: Place 8s in the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n      - 4: Place 4s horizontally if there's a 4 next to a zero.\n      - 2: Place 8s adjacent to the 2.\n      - 6: Surrounded by 8s.\n      - 7: Unknown, but maybe generates a different pattern.\n\nBut how to handle overlapping patterns? For example, if two numbers' patterns affect the same cell.\n\nIn example 0, the 3's diagonals are set to 1, and other numbers like 8s are added elsewhere. So maybe higher numbers take precedence, or they are additive, but the examples show that zeros are replaced by the pattern numbers.\n\nBut in example 0's output, the 1s from the 3 are present even though there are other numbers nearby.\n\nAnother observation: The output seems to have the same structure as the input, but with additional numbers added around the existing ones. So perhaps each number in the input causes certain cells in the output to be filled with specific values, overwriting zeros but leaving existing numbers as they are.\n\nSo, applying this to the test input:\n\n- The 3,7,3 in row 1. Each 3 would generate 1s diagonally. The 7 might generate something else. For example, 7 could generate 3s in adjacent cells, or another pattern.\n\nBut since 7 isn't in the training data, this is a guess. Alternatively, maybe 7 is treated as a higher number that generates a larger diamond. For example, 3 generates 1s at distance 1, 7 generates 3s at distance 3? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 7 could be a new number that is left as is, but its neighboring cells are modified based on another rule. For example, in the test input's row 1, the 7 is between two 3s. The 3s generate their 1s diagonally, but the 7 might need to generate something else. Maybe 7 is surrounded by 3s, but that's just a guess.\n\nAnother part of the test input: row 8 has 2,4,2. Following the pattern from example 2, two 2s with a zero in between would become 2,8,2. But here, it's 2,4,2. So the 4 is in the middle. Since 4 is present, maybe the rule for 4 applies. For example, 4 generates 4s around it, but in this case, the 4 is between two 2s. Not sure.\n\nThe test input's row 16: 4,0,0... Maybe if there's a 4 followed by zeros, but no other 4s nearby, nothing changes. Unless the 4 generates 4s in adjacent cells. But in example 1, 4s generated 8s between them.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to codify the possible rules based on training examples and apply them to the test input.\n\nRules observed:\n\n1. Two identical numbers separated by a single zero are replaced with that number and a middle number:\n   - 4,0,4 \u2192 4,8,4\n   - 8,0,8 \u2192 8,2,8\n   - So for X,0,X \u2192 X,Y,X where Y depends on X. For X=4, Y=8; X=8, Y=2.\n\n2. Single numbers generate patterns around them:\n   - 3 generates 1s in the four diagonal cells.\n   - 2 generates 8s adjacent (left and right?), as in example 2 where 2 becomes 8,2,8.\n   - 6 is surrounded by 8s (as in example 0, input has 6 in middle of 8s, output same).\n\n3. When a number is in a certain position, it may cause expansion in adjacent rows. For example, in example 0, the 8 in row 3 leads to 8s below and above.\n\nBut how to apply these rules step by step.\n\nApplying to test input:\n\nFirst, process all pairs of identical numbers separated by a single zero.\n\nIn the test input:\n\n- Row 15: [...,0,2,0,2,0...]. The two 2s are separated by a zero. According to rule 1, if X=2, then Y would be ?. Not seen in training. But in example 2, 8,0,8 becomes 8,2,8. So for X=8, Y=2. Maybe for X=2, Y=8. So 2,0,2 \u2192 2,8,2. But this is a hypothesis.\n\nSimilarly, in row 16: [...,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0...]. No pairs here.\n\nRow 8: [...,2,4,2]. Not a pair separated by zero.\n\nRow 7: [...,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. No pairs.\n\nRow 10: [0,8,0,0,...0,7,0...]. No pairs.\n\nRow 1: [3,7,3]. Not a pair separated by zero.\n\nNow, looking for such pairs.\n\nNext, handle single numbers generating patterns.\n\nFor each non-zero cell:\n\n- 3s: Add 1s in diagonal cells.\n- 7s: Unknown. Maybe leave as is or apply another pattern.\n- 8s: Add 8s in adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n- 2s: Add 8s adjacent.\n- 4s: If part of a pair, add 8 between them. Otherwise, leave as is.\n- 6s: Surrounded by 8s.\n\nProcessing the test input:\n\nRow 1: 3,7,3.\n\nThe 3s will add 1s diagonally. For the first 3 (column 12), add 1s at (row0,11), (row0,13), (row2,11), (row2,13). For the second 3 (column14), add 1s at (row0,13), (row0,15), (row2,13), (row2,15). But these overlap at (row0,13) and (row2,13), which might sum or take maximum.\n\nRow 8: 2,4,2. The 2s would add 8s adjacent. For the first 2 (column16), add 8s left, right, up, down. But there's a 4 to the right. The second 2 (column18) would add 8s around. However, existing numbers might block.\n\nRow 10: 8 and 7. The 8 would add 8s around it. The 7 is unknown.\n\nRow 16: 4. If not part of a pair, may not change.\n\nRow 7: 2. Add 8s around.\n\nRow 8: 4. Possibly no change unless part of a pair.\n\nNow, applying these:\n\nFor the 3s in row1, columns12 and14:\n\n- 3 at (1,12): add 1s at (0,11), (0,13), (2,11), (2,13)\n- 3 at (1,14): add 1s at (0,13), (0,15), (2,13), (2,15)\n\nSo overlapping at (0,13) and (2,13). These cells would be 1s from both 3s.\n\nThe 7 in (1,13) is a new number. Since it's between two 3s, but we don't know its rule. Maybe it remains 7, and the 3s' 1s are added around it.\n\nFor the 2 in row7, column16:\n\n- Add 8s at (7,15), (7,17), (6,16), (8,16)\n\nBut in row8, column16 is 4. So the down direction from 2 would be (8,16), which is 4. So that 8 is not added there. So only left, right, and up (if zero).\n\nRow8 has 2,4,2 in columns16-18. The 2s here would add 8s around them.\n\nFor the 2 at (8,16):\n\n- Add 8s at (8,15), (8,17), (7,16), (9,16)\n\nBut (8,15) is 0, (8,17) is 0, (7,16) is 0, (9,16) is 0. So these would become 8s.\n\nSimilarly for the 2 at (8,18):\n\n- Add 8s at (8,17), (8,19) (but row length is 19, so 18 is last index?), (7,18), (9,18)\n\nAssuming the row is 0-indexed up to 18.\n\nThe 4 at (8,17) would remain 4, so the 8s from the 2s may overwrite zeros but not existing numbers.\n\nRow16: 4 at (16,5). If part of a pair, but no other 4s nearby. So no change.\n\nRow10: 8 at (10,1). Add 8s around it.\n\nRow10: 7 at (10,9). Unknown. Maybe leaves as is.\n\nRow15: two 2s separated by a zero. According to the earlier hypothesis, 2,0,2 \u2192 2,8,2.\n\nSo the zero between them becomes 8.\n\nRow16: 2 at (16,10) and (16,12). They are separated by a zero at (16,11). So 2,0,2 \u2192 2,8,2.\n\nPutting this all together, the output would have:\n\n- 1s around the 3s in row1.\n- 7 remains in row1, column13.\n- 8s added around the 2s in rows7,8, etc.\n- 2,8,2 patterns where zeros were between 2s.\n\nThis is a rough sketch, but applying these patterns to the test input would generate the output.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples, then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by analyzing the training examples to understand the transformation rules.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input has several rows with numbers like 3, 8, 6, 1, etc. The output seems to add or modify some elements. For instance, in the first row of the input, the 3 is in the middle, and in the output, there are 1s around it. Wait, looking at row 0 of input and output: the input's row 0 is all zeros, but the output's row 0 has [0,0,...,1,0,1,0...]. Hmm. Wait, maybe the pattern involves creating a diamond or cross shape around certain numbers.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the second row (index 1) has a 3 at position 13. In the output, the rows above and below (indices 0 and 2) have 1s flanking the position where 3 was. Like, in output row 0, around position 13 (the original 3's column), there's a 1 on either side. Similarly, in the input's row 4, there's 8,6,8. In the output, row 5 has an 8 added at position 19, and row 4's 8s are extended. Also, in row 10 of the input, there's a 3, and in the output, around it, there are 8s forming a diamond maybe?\n\nAnother thing to notice: in Example 1's input, there's a row with 4,8,4. The output seems to propagate these numbers. For example, the input row 3 has 4,8,4. In the output, row 4 (the next row) ends with 4,8,4. Similarly, the input's row 9 has 4,0,4,0..., and the output changes that to 4,8,4. Maybe the pattern is that certain numbers are generating adjacent numbers in specific directions or patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input, in row 1 there's 8,2,8. In the output, row 3, which originally had 8,0,8, becomes 8,2,8. Also, in the test input's row 7-9, there's a 2 and a 4 in a pattern. Maybe the transformation adds numbers around existing ones based on their value, creating some kind of cross or diamond structure.\n\nWait, let's think of each number as a center and surrounding cells get certain values. For example, a 3 might add 1s diagonally around it. Let's check Example 0's 3. The original 3 is in row 1, column 13. The output's row 0 has 1s in columns 12 and 14. So maybe a 3 generates 1s in the row above and below, diagonally adjacent? Similarly, a 7 in the test input might generate a different pattern.\n\nAnother approach: look at how numbers change. For example, in Example 0, the 6 in the input (row 4, column 6) remains a 6 in the output, but there are 8s around it. So perhaps higher numbers (like 6,7,8) act as centers, and lower numbers (1,2,3,4) might be generated around them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number in the input generates a specific pattern of numbers around it. For example, a 3 might create 1s in the cells diagonally adjacent in the rows above and below, a 4 creates 8s or something else. Let's check the examples to see.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 4,8,4 in row 3. The output's row 4 ends with 4,8,4. So maybe the 8 in the middle causes the same pattern to appear shifted down? Or perhaps the numbers are propagating downwards. Also, in the input's row 9, it's 4,0,4,0..., and the output becomes 4,8,4,0... So perhaps 4s generate an 8 between them when there's a zero in between. Like, adjacent 4s with a zero in between get an 8 in the middle. That could be a pattern.\n\nIn Example 2, the input row 1 has 8,2,8. The output in row 3 (originally 8,0,8) becomes 8,2,8. So maybe the 2 from row 1 is copied down to row 3. Or perhaps the 2 in the input is causing a certain pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are acting like \"seeds\" that create a certain structure. For example, a 3 creates a diamond of 1s around it. Let's check Example 0's 3. The input has 3 in row 1, column 13. The output's rows 0 and 2 have 1s in columns 12 and 14 (diagonal up and down). So maybe a 3 creates 1s in the positions (row-1, col-1) and (row-1, col+1), and similarly (row+1, col-1) and (row+1, col+1). So a cross in the diagonals.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2's input, there's a 2 in row 11, column 5. The output's row 11 has 8,2,8 around it. Wait, in the output, row 11 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 8, 0, ...]. So maybe a 2 generates 8s to its left and right in the same row? Or maybe it's part of a different pattern.\n\nAnother thing to note is the numbers in the output often form symmetrical patterns around the original number. For example, in Example 0's row 4, the 6 is surrounded by 8s. The 6 remains, and 8s are added around it. Maybe numbers like 6 and 7 are centers, and lower numbers form layers around them.\n\nLooking at the test input now. Let's see if we can apply the possible patterns. The test input has a 3,7,3 in row 1. So perhaps the 7 in the middle is a higher-level center. For example, in Example 0, a 3 created 1s around it. Maybe a 7 would generate 3s around it, and those 3s in turn generate 1s. But in the test input, the output might have 3s around the 7, but let's check.\n\nWait, in the test input's row 1: [0,0,...,3,7,3,0...]. So maybe the 7 is the center. If 3s generate 1s around them, and 7s generate 3s around them. So around the 7, in the output, there would be 3s in a diamond pattern. Then each 3 would generate 1s around them.\n\nAnother element in the test input is row 7-9: 2, then 2,4,2, then 2. So maybe the 4 in the center (row 8, column 16) generates something. In Example 1, a 4 in the input generated an 8 between them. So maybe when there are two 4s separated by a zero, they add an 8 in between. But here, the 4 is in the center, with 2s around. Maybe the 4 generates a cross of 8s around it.\n\nLooking at the test input's row 16: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,...]. The 4 is here. Maybe this 4 would generate 8s in adjacent positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number's value determines the radius or the pattern of numbers generated. For example:\n\n- 1s are generated by 3s.\n- 3s are generated by 7s.\n- 8s are generated by 6s or other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe numbers act as \"levels\", with higher numbers generating lower ones around them. For example, a 7 generates 3s around it, which in turn generate 1s.\n\nIn Example 0's input, there's a 6 surrounded by 8s. The output keeps the 6 and adds more 8s. So maybe 6s generate 8s in their vicinity. Then, 8s might generate other patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number in the input is a center of a certain cross or diamond shape, and the output is the sum of all such shapes. So each non-zero number in the input adds its pattern to the output, possibly overwriting existing values if there's an overlap.\n\nLet's try to model this. For each cell (i,j) in the input that has a value v, the output is generated by placing a certain pattern around (i,j) based on v. Then, overlapping patterns from multiple cells would add up, but since the examples don't show overlapping numbers (except possibly for 8s and others), maybe the patterns overwrite zeros but leave existing non-zero numbers as they are.\n\nSo, perhaps the rules are:\n\n- For a 1 in the input: no change, or maybe it's part of a pattern from a higher number.\n- For a 3: place 1s in the four diagonal positions (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j+1).\n- For a 7: place 3s in the four diagonal positions (like 3's pattern but with 3s instead of 1s).\n- For a 2: place 8s in adjacent left and right cells (same row).\n- For a 4: place 8s in adjacent top and bottom cells (same column).\n- For an 8: perhaps no change, or maybe part of a higher pattern.\n- For a 6: surrounded by 8s in a cross (up, down, left, right).\n\nWait, in Example 0's input row 4 has 8,6,8. The output's row 5 adds an 8 at position 19, but maybe that's from another cell. Alternatively, the 6 generates 8s in all four directions. So in row 4, column 6 (the 6), the output has 8s around it. Then, perhaps each 8 in the input could generate a pattern as well. For example, an 8 might generate 8s in the same row or column adjacent to it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers form layers. For example, 6 is the center, surrounded by 8s. Then, 8s might generate 1s further out, but that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are part of a cellular automaton, where certain configurations lead to specific outputs.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input row 3: [0,4,8,4,0...]. Output row 3 is the same. Output row 4 ends with 4,8,4. Also, the input's row 9 has [4,0,4,0...], which becomes [4,8,4,0...]. So when there are two 4s with a zero in between, they generate an 8 in between. So the rule could be: if two 4s are separated by a zero in the same row, replace the zero with an 8. Similarly, if two 4s are vertically aligned with a zero in between, maybe they generate an 8.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 3, the 4,8,4 remains the same in the output. Then, the row below (row 4) in the input has all zeros except the last element 8. The output row 4 ends with 4,8,4. So maybe the 4s in row 3 generate 4,8,4 in the row below, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 in row 3 (between the 4s) causes the 4s to propagate down. Like, each 4 in row 3 generates a 4 in row 4, and the 8 between them stays. But in the output row 4, the 4,8,4 is added at the end. Wait, the input row 4's original last element was 8, which in the output becomes 4,8,4. So maybe the 8 in the input (row 4, column 10) is replaced by 4,8,4. That doesn't fit the previous logic. Maybe the 8 is part of a different rule.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern for each number by looking at how they are transformed.\n\nIn Example 0, the 3 in row 1, column 13 leads to 1s in the diagonals. So 3 \u2192 1s diagonally around.\n\nIn Example 2's input, there's a 2 in row 11, column 5. The output has 8,2,8 in the same row. So 2 \u2192 8s on left and right.\n\nIn the same example, the input's row 1 has 8,2,8, which stays the same in the output. So maybe 2s between 8s are left as is.\n\nIn Example 2's output, the row 3 (originally 8,0,8) becomes 8,2,8. So the 2 is inserted between the 8s. How did that happen? Maybe when two 8s are separated by a zero, they generate a 2 in between. But that's just in that example. Or perhaps the 2 in row 11's input caused that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 in row 11's input generated the 8s around it in the output. But in the output, row 11 has 8,2,8. So maybe a 2 generates 8s on either side in the same row. But then, how does the 8,2,8 in row 1 of Example 2's input stay the same in the output? Because the 2 is already flanked by 8s. So the rule could be: a 2 generates 8s to the left and right if those positions are zero. But in the case where there are already 8s, they remain.\n\nSo, for a 2, check left and right in the same row. If those positions are zero, replace with 8. If they are already 8, leave as is. So in Example 2's input, the 2 in row 11, column 5 had zeros on left and right (since input row 11 is [0,0,0,0,0,2,0...], so in the output, it's replaced with 8,2,8. But in row 1, the 2 is already between 8s, so they stay.\n\nSimilarly, in the test input, there's a 2 in row 7, column 16. That would generate 8s left and right if those positions are zero. But looking at the test input's row 7: [0,...,0,2,0,0], so in the output, the 2 would become 8,2,8. But also, row 8 has 2,4,2. The 4 in row 8, column 16. How would that transform?\n\nLet's hypothesize the rules step by step:\n\n1. For each cell with value v in the input:\n   a. If v is 1: do nothing (they might be generated by other numbers).\n   b. If v is 2: place 8s to the left and right in the same row.\n   c. If v is 3: place 1s diagonally (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right).\n   d. If v is 4: place 8s above and below in the same column.\n   e. If v is 6: place 8s in all four adjacent directions (up, down, left, right).\n   f. If v is 7: place 3s in the same pattern as 3's 1s (diagonally).\n   g. If v is 8: maybe no action, or possibly part of a larger pattern (but in examples, 8s are often part of other patterns).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis against the examples.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 3 in row 1, column 13 generates 1s in (0,12), (0,14), (2,12), (2,14). Which matches the output.\n\nThe 6 in row 4, column 6 generates 8s in all four directions. The input row 4 has 8,6,8, so the 6 generates 8s around it, which are already present. Then, in the output row 5, column 19 has an 8. Maybe that's from another cell. Looking at row 5's input: it has an 8 at column 6 and a 6 at column 19? Wait, no. Wait the input row 5 is [0,...,0,8,0...] and then 0,6,0. Wait, maybe the 6 in row 10? Hmm, perhaps I need to re-examine.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 10 has a 3 in column 2. The output for row 10 has 8,6,8 around it. Wait, no. Wait the input row 10 is [0,0,3,0,0...]. The output row 10 is [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0...]. So perhaps the 6 in the input is generating 8s around it, but how does the 6 get there?\n\nWait, the input's row 4 is [0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0...]. The 6 is in column 6. So the 6 would generate 8s in all four directions. But the existing 8s are already present. So the output row 4 remains the same. Then, in row 5, the input has 8 at column 6 and 0 at column 19. Wait, maybe other numbers are affecting this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s in the input also generate their own patterns. For example, an 8 might generate 8s in the same row, expanding outward. Like in Example 1, the input has 4,8,4, and the output has the same in row 3, but row 4 ends with 4,8,4. So maybe the 8 in row 3, column 2 (assuming 0-based) generates 4s below it. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are part of a diamond pattern when combined with other numbers. For example, the 6 is surrounded by 8s, and each 8 might generate their own patterns. But this is getting too vague.\n\nLet's focus on the test input. The test input has a 7 in row 1, column 13 (since the row is [0,0,...,3,7,3,0...]. According to our hypothetical rule, a 7 would generate 3s in the four diagonal positions. So around (1,13), the diagonals would be (0,12), (0,14), (2,12), (2,14). But in the input's row 1, there are already 3s adjacent to the 7, so perhaps those 3s are part of the pattern generated by the 7. Then each of those 3s would generate their own 1s in their diagonals.\n\nAdditionally, in the test input's row 7-9, there's a 2 in row 7 column 16, then a 4 in row 8 column 16, and a 2 in row 9 column 16. According to the rules:\n\n- The 2 in row 7 would generate 8s to the left and right. So in row 7, columns 15 and 17 would become 8. But in the input, those positions are 0, so they become 8.\n\n- The 4 in row 8 column 16 would generate 8s above and below. So in row 7 column 16 and row 9 column 16. But row 7 column 16 is a 2 (input) and row 9 column 16 is a 2 (input). So perhaps the 4 would overwrite those? But in the example, when there's a 4 between 2s, maybe they don't get replaced. Alternatively, the 4 generates 8s in those positions regardless of existing values. But the existing 2s would then be replaced by 8s. But in the test input's output, we need to see what happens.\n\nWait, in the test input's row 8: [0,...,0,2,4,2,0...]. So the 4 is between two 2s. According to our rule, the 4 would generate 8s above and below. So in row 7 column 16 (which has a 2) would become 8, and row 9 column 16 (which has a 2) would become 8. But in the output, perhaps those 2s are replaced with 8s. Alternatively, maybe higher numbers take precedence. For example, if a cell is modified by multiple rules, the highest number stays. So if a 2 is generating 8s but a 4 is also generating an 8 in the same cell, the 8 would stay.\n\nBut this is speculative. Let's try to apply the rules step by step for the test input.\n\nTest input row 1: [3,7,3]. The 7 would generate 3s diagonally around it. So positions (0,12), (0,14), (2,12), (2,14). The existing 3s in the input are in positions (1,12) and (1,14). So the 7's generated 3s would be in (0,12), (0,14), (2,12), (2,14). Then each of those 3s would generate 1s in their diagonals. So each 3 at (0,12) would generate 1s at (-1,11), (-1,13), (1,11), (1,13). But row can't be negative, so maybe those are ignored. So 1s at (1,11) and (1,13) for the (0,12) 3. Wait, this is getting complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number's effect is to create a certain pattern in the output, and overlapping patterns are handled by overwriting zeros or adding values, but in the examples, the output cells don't have sums; they have specific numbers. So it's likely that each pattern overwrites the cells with their values, but existing non-zero cells are left as is.\n\nBut how to determine the priority when multiple patterns affect the same cell. For example, if a cell is affected by a 3 and a 7's pattern, which takes precedence? The examples don't show such conflicts, so maybe the patterns are designed not to overlap, or the highest number takes precedence.\n\nThis is getting quite involved. Let's try to proceed with the initial hypothesis and see if the test input's expected output can be generated.\n\nTest input's row 1: 3,7,3.\n\n- The 7 at (1,13) generates 3s at (0,12), (0,14), (2,12), (2,14).\n\n- Each of the existing 3s at (1,12) and (1,14) would generate 1s at (0,11), (0,13), (2,11), (2,13) for the left 3, and (0,13), (0,15), (2,13), (2,15) for the right 3. \n\nBut wait, the left 3 is at (1,12), so diagonals would be (0,11), (0,13), (2,11), (2,13). Similarly, the right 3 at (1,14) would generate (0,13), (0,15), (2,13), (2,15). So overlapping at (0,13) and (2,13). But perhaps those cells will have 1s from both, but since they're the same value, it's okay.\n\nSo in the output, row 0 would have 1s at columns 11, 13, 15. Row 2 would have 1s at columns 11, 13, 15. But the original input row 0 and 2 are all zeros, so they can be filled with these 1s.\n\nAdditionally, the 7-generated 3s at (0,12) and (0,14) would themselves generate 1s. For example, the 3 at (0,12) would generate 1s at (-1,11), (-1,13), (1,11), (1,13). But row -1 is invalid, so only (1,11) and (1,13). However, the original input's row 1, columns 11 and 13: column 11 is zero, column 13 is 7. So the 3-generated 1s would set (1,11) and (1,13) to 1. But (1,13) is the 7, which is non-zero, so it remains 7. So only (1,11) would be set to 1.\n\nSimilarly, the 3 at (0,14) would generate 1s at (1,13) and (1,15). Again, (1,13) is 7, so it stays. (1,15) is zero, so becomes 1.\n\nThis is getting very detailed. Perhaps the key is to apply each number's pattern in the output, overwriting zeros but leaving existing non-zeros as they are.\n\nNow, looking at the test input's row 8: [0,...,0,2,4,2,0...]. The 4 here would generate 8s above and below. So in row 7, column 16 and row 9, column 16. The input's row 7, column 16 is 2, row 9, column 16 is 2. So the 4's pattern would try to set those to 8. But since they are non-zero (2), they would remain 2. But wait, in Example 1, when there were 4s in the input with a zero in between, an 8 was generated. So perhaps the 4's pattern only affects cells that are zero, leaving existing numbers as they are.\n\nSo in the test input's case, the 4 in row 8, column 16 would generate 8s in row 7,16 and row 9,16 only if those cells are zero. Since they are 2, they remain 2. So no change there.\n\nThen, the 2s in row 7 and 9, column 16 would generate 8s to their left and right. For row 7, column 16: generate 8s at columns 15 and 17. Those cells are 0 in the input, so they become 8. For row 9, column 16: generate 8s at columns 15 and 17. Those are zeros, so they become 8.\n\nThen, the 2 in row 8, column 17 (wait, the input's row 8 has [...,2,4,2...], so column 16 is 4, columns 15 is 0, 16 is 4, 17 is 2. So row 8, column 17 is 2. That 2 would generate 8s at columns 16 and 18. Column 16 is 4, so remains. Column 18 is 0, becomes 8.\n\nBut this is getting quite involved. Perhaps the best way is to generate the output by applying each number's pattern, assuming that each non-zero in the input generates certain values in the output, overwriting zeros but leaving other numbers as they are.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nLet's process each non-zero cell in the test input:\n\nRow 1, columns 12,13,14: 3,7,3.\n\n- 3 at (1,12): generates 1s at (0,11), (0,13), (2,11), (2,13).\n- 7 at (1,13): generates 3s at (0,12), (0,14), (2,12), (2,14).\n- 3 at (1,14): generates 1s at (0,13), (0,15), (2,13), (2,15).\n\nRow 2, column 8: 8.\n\n- 8: according to our earlier rules, perhaps no action. Or maybe generates something else. Not sure. But in the examples, 8s were part of other patterns. For example, in Example 0, the 8s in the input generated more 8s. Maybe an 8 generates 8s in the same row left and right? Or in the same column up and down? Let's see.\n\nRow 3, column 3:4.\n\n- 4 generates 8s at (2,3) and (4,3).\n\nRow 6, columns 5 and 7:3.\n\n- Each 3 generates 1s diagonally. For (6,5): 1s at (5,4), (5,6), (7,4), (7,6).\n- For (6,7): 1s at (5,6), (5,8), (7,6), (7,8).\n\nRow 7, column 16:2.\n\n- Generates 8s at (7,15) and (7,17).\n\nRow 8, columns 15,16,17:2,4,2.\n\n- 2 at (8,15): generates 8s at (8,14) and (8,16). But (8,16) is 4, so only (8,14) becomes 8.\n- 4 at (8,16): generates 8s at (7,16) and (9,16). But (7,16) is 2, (9,16) is 2, so no change.\n- 2 at (8,17): generates 8s at (8,16) and (8,18). (8,16) is 4, so no change. (8,18) is 0, becomes 8.\n\nRow 9, column 16:2.\n\n- Generates 8s at (9,15) and (9,17).\n\nRow 10, column 1:8.\n\n- Maybe generates 8s to the left and right? If 8's rule is to generate 8s in the same row, then (10,0) and (10,2). But row 10's input has 8 at column 1, and 0s at 0 and 2. So output would have 8,8,8.\n\nRow 10, column 9:7.\n\n- Generates 3s diagonally: (9,8), (9,10), (11,8), (11,10).\n\nRow 15, column 10:2.\n\n- Generates 8s at (15,9) and (15,11).\n\nRow 16, columns 5:4, 10:2, 17:8.\n\n- 4 at (16,5): generates 8s at (15,5) and (17,5).\n- 2 at (16,10): generates 8s at (16,9) and (16,11).\n- 8 at (16,17): perhaps no action.\n\nRow 17, column 17:1.\n\n- Maybe no action.\n\nRow 18, column 17:8.\n\n- No action.\n\nNow, let's start building the output step by step. Starting with a copy of the input, then applying each pattern.\n\nBut perhaps the output is generated by only adding the patterns, not keeping the original numbers. Or maybe the original numbers remain, and the patterns are added around them.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the original numbers are usually preserved. For example, in Example 0's row 1, the 3 remains, and the output adds 1s around it. So the original number stays, and the generated numbers are added in the surrounding cells.\n\nSo, the process would be:\n\n- For each non-zero cell in the input, add the corresponding pattern around it.\n- The original cell's value remains unchanged.\n- If multiple patterns affect the same cell, the highest value takes precedence, or perhaps the latest one overwrites.\n\nBut the examples don't show overlapping, so perhaps each pattern is applied without conflict.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nStarting with the test input as the initial output, then applying the patterns:\n\nRow 1, columns 12 (3), 13 (7), 14 (3).\n\n- 3 at (1,12): add 1s at (0,11), (0,13), (2,11), (2,13).\n- 7 at (1,13): add 3s at (0,12), (0,14), (2,12), (2,14).\n- 3 at (1,14): add 1s at (0,13), (0,15), (2,13), (2,15).\n\nSo, in row 0:\n\n- columns 11: 1 (from 3 at 1,12)\n- column 12: 3 (from 7 at 1,13)\n- column 13: 1 (from 3 at 1,14) and possibly 3's other effect? Wait, the 7's pattern adds 3 at (0,12) and (0,14). The 3 at (1,14) adds 1 at (0,13) and (0,15).\n\nSo row 0 becomes:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but the test input's row 0 is initially all zeros. After applying the patterns:\n\n- (0,11): 1\n- (0,12): 3\n- (0,13): 1 (from 3 at 1,14)\n- (0,14): 3 (from 7 at 1,13)\n- (0,15): 1 (from 3 at 1,14)\n\nSo row 0 would have 1,3,1,3,1 at columns 11-15.\n\nRow 2:\n\n- (2,11): 1 (from 3 at 1,12)\n- (2,12): 3 (from 7 at 1,13)\n- (2,13): 1 (from 3 at 1,14)\n- (2,14): 3 (from 7 at 1,13)\n- (2,15): 1 (from 3 at 1,14)\n\nSo row 2 has these values added.\n\nNext, row 2's column 8 is 8. If 8's pattern is to generate 8s left and right, then columns 7 and 9 become 8. But original input row 2 has 8 at column 8, and zeros elsewhere. So output row 2 would have:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,1,3,1,3,1,0,...].\n\nBut wait, the 8's pattern might not be left-right. Maybe 8s are part of a different pattern. For example, in Example 0, 8s are part of a diamond around a 6. So perhaps the 8s themselves don't generate anything, but are part of patterns generated by other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 8s generate 8s in adjacent cells. For example, each 8 in the input generates 8s in the four directions. But in Example 0, the 8s around the 6 are already present, so they don't generate more 8s. But in the test input's row 2, column 8 has an 8. If it generates 8s up, down, left, right, then row 1 and 3, column 8 would get 8s. But row 3's column 8 is 0, so becomes 8, and row 1's column 8 is 0, becomes 8. So in row 1, column 8 would be 8. But the original row 1 has other values. But the 8 from row 2's pattern would overwrite zeros. So row 1, column 8 becomes 8.\n\nThis is getting very complex. Maybe the key is to process each number according to their rules and build the output step by step.\n\nBut without knowing all the exact rules, it's challenging. However, based on the examples, the patterns seem to involve placing numbers around the original in specific directions, depending on the value.\n\nFor the test input's 7, which is new compared to the training examples, we can infer that it generates 3s around it in a diamond pattern, and those 3s generate 1s.\n\nAnother element is the 4 in row 3, column 3. According to the hypothesis, it would generate 8s above and below. So in row 2 and 4, column 3. The input's row 2, column 3 is 0, row 4, column 3 is 0. So those become 8.\n\nRow 6's 3s at columns 5 and 7 generate 1s in their diagonals. For (6,5):\n\n- (5,4), (5,6), (7,4), (7,6) become 1.\n\nFor (6,7):\n\n- (5,6), (5,8), (7,6), (7,8) become 1.\n\nSo row 5's columns 4,6,8 become 1. Row 7's columns 4,6,8 become 1.\n\nRow 7's column 16 is 2, so generates 8s at 15 and 17.\n\nRow 8's 2 at column 15 generates 8s at 14 and 16. Column 16 is 4, so only 14 becomes 8. The 4 at column 16 generates 8s at row 7 and 9, column 16. But those are 2s, so no change. The 2 at column 17 generates 8s at 16 and 18. Column 16 is 4, so no change. Column 18 becomes 8.\n\nRow 9's column 16 is 2, generates 8s at 15 and 17.\n\nRow 10's column 1 is 8. If 8s generate 8s left and right, then columns 0 and 2 become 8.\n\nRow 10's column 9 is 7, generates 3s at (9,8), (9,10), (11,8), (11,10).\n\nRow 15's column 10 is 2, generates 8s at 9 and 11.\n\nRow 16's column 5 is 4, generates 8s at (15,5) and (17,5).\n\nRow 16's column 10 is 2, generates 8s at 9 and 11.\n\nRow 16's column 17 is 8, no action.\n\nRow 17's column 17 is 1, no action.\n\nRow 18's column 17 is 8, no action.\n\nPutting all this together, the output would have:\n\n- In row 0: 1s and 3s around the 7's area.\n- In row 2: 8s from the 8 in row 2, and 1s from the 3s.\n- In row 3: the 4 generates 8s above and below.\n- Many 8s generated from 2s and 4s in various rows.\n- The 7 in row 10, column 9 generates 3s around it, which then generate 1s.\n\nThis is a rough outline. Given the complexity, the final answer will need to reflect these patterns, but due to time constraints, I'll proceed to generate the output based on these observations.",
