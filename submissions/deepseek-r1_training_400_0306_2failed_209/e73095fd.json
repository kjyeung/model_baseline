        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern in the training examples that maps the input lists to the output lists, then apply that pattern to the given test input. Let me start by carefully analyzing the training examples to identify the transformation rule.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nIn the input rows, there are a lot of 5s and 0s. The output changes some of the 0s and 5s to 4s. Let me see where those 4s appear. For instance, in the second row of the input, the last element is 0, but in the output, it's 4. Wait, let me check each row to see exactly where the changes happen.\n\nIn Example 0's first input row:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]\nThe output is the same. So no changes here.\n\nSecond input row:\n[5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\nThe output changes the last element from 0 to 4. Let me check other positions. The 5s in positions 0,1,5,6,7,8,13,17 stay as 5. The 0 at position 18 becomes 4. Hmm, why?\n\nLooking at the next row in input:\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\nThe output changes the 0s at positions 0,6,7,18 to 4s. Wait, the first element was 0 and becomes 4. The sixth and seventh elements (0,0) become 4,4. The last element (0) becomes 4. So maybe it's related to surrounding elements?\n\nAnother observation: The 4s often replace certain 0s that are adjacent to 5s. For example, in the second example, let's look at the input where 0 is surrounded by 5s. Maybe it's when a 0 is enclosed by 5s on some sides? Or perhaps the 0s that are part of a 'corner' or a specific structure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input and output. In the input, there's a row like [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0...], and in the output, those middle 0s become 4s. Like, in the fifth row of input Example 1:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 4,4,4,5, 0, 0,0,5,0,0,5,4]\n\nSo the 0s in positions 4,5,6 become 4s. That looks like the 0s are between two 5s. Wait, the 5 is at positions 3 and 7. So the 0s between them (positions 4-6) are replaced by 4s. So maybe the rule is that any 0 that is between two 5s (either horizontally or vertically) gets replaced by 4?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s are replacing 0s that are part of a 'corridor' between 5s. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 0's third row input:\n[5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0,5,0,0,0,5,0]\nOutput: [5,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4]\n\nThe 0s at positions 6 and 7 become 4s. The original elements there were 0 and 0. Looking at their neighbors: position 5 is 5 (left), position 8 is 5 (right). So these 0s are between 5s on left and right. So maybe that's the pattern. So whenever a 0 is flanked by 5s on both the left and right in the same row, replace it with 4. Similarly, maybe vertically as well.\n\nWait, in Example 0's second row input: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0]. Output changes the first 0 to 4, the 0s at positions 6 and 7 to 4, and the last 0 to 4. Let's check the surrounding elements. The first 0 (position 0) is next to a 5 (position 1). But perhaps if it's on the edge, maybe adjacent to a 5 on one side and the boundary? But then why replace with 4? Hmm, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are used to replace 0s that are part of a 'border' around a region of 5s. Like, if a 0 is adjacent (either horizontally or vertically) to a 5, then it becomes 4. But in that case, almost all 0s next to 5s would be 4. But looking at the first example's first input row, all 0s except the ones around the 5s in the middle are still 0s. Wait, in the first example's first row, there's a 5 in position 13. The surrounding 0s are not converted to 4s. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the 4s are replacing 0s that are inside a certain structure made by 5s. Like, if a 0 is enclosed by 5s in a certain way. Let's think of the 5s forming a rectangle, and the 0s inside the rectangle are replaced by 4s. For example, in Example 1's fifth row input, there's a 5 at positions 3 and 7, forming a horizontal line, and the 0s between them become 4s. Similarly, if there's a vertical line of 5s with 0s between them, those 0s become 4s.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be replacing 0s that are in a cross shape between 5s. Let's check another part. For example, in Example 0's seventh row input:\n\nInput row: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5]\nOutput row: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,4,4,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nHere, the 0s at positions 12 and 13 are replaced by 4s. Looking at their neighbors: left is 5 (position 11), right is 5 (position 14). So they are between 5s horizontally. So maybe that's the rule: any 0 that is between two 5s in the same row, replace with 4. Similarly, if a 0 is between two 5s vertically (same column, above and below), replace with 4.\n\nWait, but how about vertical checks? Let me look for a case where a 0 is between 5s vertically.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input. Let's take the third row input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5]\nThe output changes the 0s in positions 12,13,14 (the 0s before 5,5) to 4s. Wait, in the output row, the input 0s at positions 12,13,14 (assuming 0-based index) are replaced by 4s. Let me check their vertical neighbors. Maybe the rows above and below have 5s in those columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of horizontal and vertical adjacency.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s are replacing 0s that are part of the \"interior\" of a structure made of 5s. For example, in a grid, if a region of 0s is surrounded by 5s on all four sides (like a closed loop), then the 0s inside become 4s. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nLooking back at Example 1's fifth row input: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]. The output changes the middle 0s (positions 4-6) to 4s. So those 0s are between two 5s in the same row. Similarly, in Example 0's second row, the last element is 0 and becomes 4. Let's check the elements around it. The previous element in that row is 5 (position 17), and the element in the row below (third row) at position 18 is 0. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the last element is at the end of a row and adjacent to a 5 in the same row. But in the input row, the elements before it are 5 and 0 (positions 17 and 18). Wait, the input row is:\n\n[5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nSo the last element is 0. In the output, it's 4. The element to the left is 5 (position 17). The element in the next row (third row) at position 18 is 0. So maybe it's not vertical. So maybe the rule is: a 0 becomes 4 if it is between two 5s in the same row. Like, if in the same row, a 0 is between 5s on the left and right. Let's test that.\n\nIn Example 0's third input row:\n\n[5,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0]\nOutput becomes [5,5,0,0,0,5,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4]\n\nSo positions 6 and 7 in the input row are 0,0. In the output, they are 4,4. Looking at their left and right neighbors in the row. Left neighbor (position 5) is 5. Right neighbor (position 8) is 5. So these 0s are between two 5s in the same row. So the 0s between 5 and 5 in the same row are replaced by 4. That seems to fit. Similarly, in the same row, the last element (position 18) was 0. Its left neighbor is 5 (position 17). The right neighbor is beyond the array. So maybe if a 0 is adjacent to a 5 on the left and there's a 5 somewhere to the right in the same row, but not necessarily adjacent. Hmm, that might not be the case.\n\nWait, in the third row of Example 0's input, the 0s at positions 6 and 7 are between 5s (position 5 and 8), so they are between two 5s in the same row. So those 0s become 4s. The last 0 (position 18) is adjacent to 5 on the left (position 17), but to the right there's nothing. So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a vertical structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s are replacing 0s that are in positions that are part of a 'path' between 5s. Maybe any 0 that is adjacent (either horizontally or vertically) to a 5, and also adjacent to another 5 in a different direction. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of the 4s as forming a sort of \"corridor\" between 5s. For instance, if a 0 is between two 5s in a line (either horizontal or vertical), then it becomes 4. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row input, the 0s between 5s in the same row become 4s. Similarly, in Example 0's seventh input row, the 0s in positions 12 and 13 (after the 5s) become 4s. Let's check their neighbors. In that row, input is [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5]. The 0s at positions 12 and 13 are between 5 (position 11) and 5 (position 14), so horizontally between two 5s, hence replaced by 4s.\n\nAnother example: In Example 2's input, let's look at the second row:\n\nInput: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0]\nOutput: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,4,5,0]\n\nThe 0s at positions 12,13,14 are replaced by 4s. In their row, they are between 5 (position 11) and 5 (position 15) in the same row. So again, between 5s horizontally. So this seems to hold.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2's fifth row input:\n\nInput: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0]\nOutput: [5,5,5,5,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nThe 0s at positions 4 and 5 are replaced by 4s. They are between 5 (position 3) and 5 (position 6) in the same row. So again, horizontal.\n\nNow, what about vertical cases? Let's look for a 0 that is between two 5s vertically (same column, above and below).\n\nTake Example 0's input row 1 (index 1):\n\nInput: [5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0]\nOutput: [5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4]\n\nThe last element (position 18) is 0 \u2192 4. Let's check the column 18 in the surrounding rows. The row above (row 0) has 5 at column 18 (input row 0 ends with 5,5). Wait, input row 0 is [0,0,...,5,0,0,0,5,5]. So column 18 is 5 (since the list is 0-based, the last element is index 18). Then row 1's column 18 is 0. The row below (row 2) has column 18 as 0. So maybe that's not vertical. Hmm, perhaps this is a different case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0 is adjacent to a 5 on the left (same row, position 17 is 5) and there's a 5 in the row below in the same column. Let me check. Row 1's column 18 is 0. Row 2's column 18 is 0. So maybe that's not the case. Hmm, perhaps this 0 is part of a horizontal sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that a 0 becomes 4 if it is adjacent to a 5 either on the left or right, and also adjacent to a 5 above or below. But that's getting more complicated.\n\nWait, let's think of the 4s as being placed in positions where they are between two 5s either horizontally or vertically. For example, a 0 that has a 5 to the left and right, or a 5 above and below.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's row 1's last element (position 18) is 0 \u2192 4. The element to the left is 5 (position 17). The element below (row 2, column 18) is 0. So maybe vertical adjacency isn't a factor here. But why is this 0 turned into 4? Because in the same row, it's after a 5 (position 17) and possibly there's a 5 in the next row? Let me check row 2's column 18: input is 0. So not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are replacing 0s that are in the same row as a 5 and are at the edge of a group of 0s. For example, the last 0 in a row that's preceded by a 5. Like, in row 1 of Example 0's input, after the 5 at position 17, there's a 0 which becomes 4. Maybe the rule is that any 0 that comes immediately after a 5 in the same row, and there's no other 5 after it, gets turned into 4? But that doesn't fit other examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s are used to represent the 'inner' 0s of a structure made by 5s. For example, if there's a rectangle of 5s, the 0s inside become 4s. But how do we determine the rectangle? Let's look at Example 1's sixth row input:\n\nInput row: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0]\nOutput row: [0,0,0,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4]\n\nThe 0s between the 5 at position 3 and 5 at position 7 become 4s. Then, the 0s in positions 4-6 are replaced. So this is a horizontal line of 5s at positions 3 and 7, and the 0s in between become 4s. So it's like when two 5s are in the same row, and there are 0s between them, replace those 0s with 4s. Similarly, if two 5s are in the same column with 0s between them, replace those 0s with 4s vertically.\n\nSo the rule could be: for any 0 in the grid, if there exists a 5 to both the left and right in the same row, or a 5 above and below in the same column, replace the 0 with 4. That could explain the horizontal cases we've seen. Let's check a vertical case.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input row 7:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5]\nOutput: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,4,4,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nIn this row, the 0s at positions 12 and 13 (now 4s) are between 5 (position 11) and 5 (position 14) horizontally. So that fits the horizontal rule.\n\nNow, looking for vertical cases. Let's check Example 2's third input row:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5]\n\nThe 0s at positions 12,13,14 are replaced by 4s. Let's check vertically. For position 12, check the rows above and below. The row above (row 2) has 5s in column 12? Let's see:\n\nRow 2 in Example 2's input: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nSo column 12 in row 2 is 0. The row below (row 4) in Example 2's input: [0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0]. So column 12 is 0. So vertically, there's no 5 above and below. However, in the same row (row 3), the 0s at 12,13,14 are between 5 (position 11) and 5 (position 15) horizontally. So again, horizontal.\n\nSo far, all examples seem to replace 0s that are between two 5s in the same row. What about vertical cases?\n\nLooking at the test input, perhaps there's a vertical case. For example, let's look at the test input row 3:\n\n[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n\nThis row is all 5s except the first two elements. So perhaps in another row, there's a 0 in the same column between two 5s vertically. Let's imagine that in another part of the test input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern only considers horizontal adjacency. But in some examples, perhaps there are vertical adjacents. Let's check Example 2's input row 10:\n\nInput row 10: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput row: [0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nWait, no, in the output for Example 2's row 10, the input is [0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0], and the output is the same. Hmm, but there's a 5 in row 10, column 10. Let me see if any 0s are between 5s vertically.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any 0 that is between two 5s in the same row or column is replaced by 4. Let's check a possible vertical case.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input row 5:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]\nOutput: [0,0,0,5,4,4,4,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,4]\n\nThe 0s between the 5s in the same row are replaced. Now, what about a column where a 0 is between two 5s vertically. For example, let's look at Example 0's input row 4:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5]\nOutput: [0,0,0,0,0,5,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5]\n\nIn row 4, positions 6 and 7 are 0,0 in input, which become 4,4. These are between 5 (position 5) and 5 (position 8) in the same row. So horizontal again.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is to replace 0s that are between two 5s horizontally. So any 0 in a row that has a 5 to the left and a 5 to the right (not necessarily adjacent) becomes a 4. But how to determine the range. For example, if there are multiple 5s, perhaps the 0s between the leftmost and rightmost 5 in the row are replaced.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's row 1 input:\n\n[5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nThe 0s from positions 2-4 (0,0,0) are between two 5s (positions 1 and 5). But in the output, they remain 0. Wait, this contradicts the previous hypothesis. Because in the input row 1, the 0s at positions 2-4 are between 5s (positions 1 and 5). But in the output, those 0s are not replaced. So why aren't they 4s?\n\nAh, this is a problem. So what's different about those 0s? Let me look at the output for row 1:\n\nOutput: [5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4]\n\nSo the 0s at positions 2-4 (0,0,0) remain 0. But the 0s at positions 6-7 (5,5,5,5 in the input row 1's positions 5-8 are 5,5,5,5). Wait, no, input row 1's elements 5-8 are 5,5,5,5. So those positions are 5s. Then the 0s at positions 2-4 are between 5s at positions 1 and 5 (which is a 5). So according to the previous hypothesis, they should be replaced by 4s, but they aren't. So that contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is more complex. So what's different between those 0s and the others that do get replaced?\n\nLooking at the input row 1, the 0s at positions 2-4 are between two 5s (positions 1 and 5), but they are not replaced. But in other rows, like Example 1's row 5, the 0s between two 5s are replaced. So why the difference?\n\nAh, maybe the rule is that 0s are replaced by 4s only if they are adjacent to 5s on both sides in the same row. For example, the 0 must have a 5 immediately to the left and right. But in Example 0's row 1, the 0s at positions 2-4 are between 5s but not adjacent. For example, position 2 has 5 at position 1 and 0 at position 2. The next 5 is at position 5. So there are two 0s between them. So if the rule requires that a 0 is directly between two 5s (i.e., has a 5 on both immediate left and right), then only single 0s or those adjacent would be replaced. But in Example 1's row 5:\n\nInput row 5 (Example 1): [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]\nOutput: [0,0,0,5,4,4,4,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,4]\n\nThe 0s between positions 4-6 (three 0s) are between two 5s (positions 3 and 7). So they are replaced by 4s. So the rule must allow for multiple 0s between two 5s in the same row, and replace all of them. So why in Example 0's row 1, the 0s between 5s are not replaced?\n\nWait, looking back at Example 0's row 1 input: [5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nThe 0s at positions 2-4 are between 5 at position 1 and 5 at position 5. So why aren't they replaced? Let's look at the output for this row. The output is [5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4]. So only the last 0 is replaced. Hmm. This complicates the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that 0s are replaced by 4s only when they are part of a group of 0s that are surrounded by 5s on both ends of the row, and there are at least two 5s in the row. But that doesn't explain the other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are replacing 0s that are part of a \"corner\" or a more complex structure. For example, if a 0 is part of a path that turns a corner. But this seems vague.\n\nAnother angle: in all examples, the output has 4s only in certain positions where the 0s are between 5s. But how to determine which 0s to replace.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is replacing 0s that are part of a \"plus\" sign made by 5s. For example, if a 0 is surrounded by 5s in a cross shape (up, down, left, right), then replace with 4. But this would require more 5s around.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 5s as forming a number 8, and the 4s as the inner parts. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s are replacing 0s that are enclosed by 5s on all four sides. But that would require 5s above, below, left, and right, which isn't the case in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s are being placed in positions where a 0 has at least two adjacent 5s, either horizontally or vertically. For example, if a 0 has a 5 to the left and right, or a 5 above and below, then it's replaced by 4. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's row 1, the last element (0) is replaced by 4. Its left neighbor is 5 (position 17), but the right neighbor is beyond the array. So that's only one 5 adjacent. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example 1's row 5, the 0s at positions 4-6 have a 5 to the left (position 3) and right (position 7). So they are between two 5s horizontally, so they become 4s. This fits.\n\nIn Example 0's row 2, the 0s at positions 6-7 are between two 5s (positions 5 and 8), so replaced by 4s. This fits.\n\nIn Example 0's row 3, the 0s at positions 6-7 are between two 5s (positions 5 and 8), so replaced by 4s.\n\nIn Example 0's row 1, the 0s at positions 2-4 are between two 5s (positions 1 and 5). So according to this rule, they should be replaced. But they aren't. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nWhat's different about those 0s? In row 1 of Example 0, the elements after position 5 are all 5s. So from position 5 to 8, it's 5,5,5,5. So the 0s at positions 2-4 are between two 5s (position 1 and 5), but there are more 5s to the right. So why aren't the 0s replaced? Maybe the rule is that the 0s must be between two 5s with no other 5s between them. But in row 1, the 0s are between 5 at position 1 and 5 at position 5, but positions 5-8 are 5s. So perhaps the left and right 5s must be the immediate next ones. For example, for a 0 to be between two 5s, there should be 5 on both immediate sides. But in row 1, position 2 is 0, left is 5 (position 1), right is 0 (position 3). So no 5 to the right. Hence, not replaced. Ah, that's it! The rule is: a 0 is replaced by 4 if, in the same row, it is between two 5s such that to the left and right of the 0 (immediately adjacent) are 5s. So for a 0 to be replaced, it must have a 5 immediately to the left and a 5 immediately to the right.\n\nWait, but in Example 1's row 5, the input is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]. The 0s at positions 4-6 are between 5s at positions 3 and 7. But between them, there are three 0s. So the immediate left of position 4 is 5 (position 3), and the immediate right of position 4 is 0 (position 5). So according to this hypothesis, only the 0s that are directly between two 5s (i.e., 5-0-5) would be replaced. But in this example, the 0s are replaced even though they are in between. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 0 in the same row that has a 5 somewhere to the left and a 5 somewhere to the right, regardless of distance. So all 0s between two 5s in the same row are replaced, regardless of whether there are other 5s in between.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 1, the 0s at positions 2-4 are between 5 at position 1 and 5 at position 5. So all 0s between them would be replaced. But in the output, they are not. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that 0s are replaced by 4s only if they are part of a contiguous block of 0s that is flanked by 5s on both ends in the same row. For example, if a sequence of 0s starts with a 5 on the left and ends with a 5 on the right, then all 0s in between are replaced by 4s.\n\nIn Example 1's row 5, the 0s between positions 3 (5) and 7 (5) are replaced. So the sequence 5,0,0,0,5 becomes 5,4,4,4,5.\n\nIn Example 0's row 1, the 0s between positions 1 (5) and 5 (5) would be positions 2-4 (three 0s). But in the output, they remain 0. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at Example 0's row 1 input:\n\nInput row 1: [5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nBetween position 1 (5) and position 5 (5), there are 0s at positions 2-4. But in the output, those are not replaced. So why?\n\nBut in the output for row 1, the only 4 is at position 18. So what's different about that 0? It's in position 18, left is 5 (position 17), and to the right is the end of the row.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at all examples, the 4s are replacing 0s that are in certain positions, possibly forming a specific pattern. For instance, in Example 0's output, the 4s form a kind of border around some 5s. Or maybe they are part of a diagonal pattern. Alternatively, the 4s could be representing the number of 5s surrounding a 0. For example, a 0 becomes 4 if it has exactly two adjacent 5s. But I need to check.\n\nFor instance, take a 0 that is between two 5s horizontally. In Example 1's row 5, the 0s in positions 4-6 have 5s to the left and right. Each of these 0s has a 5 to the left and right. So for each of those 0s, the number of adjacent 5s is two (left and right). So replaced by 4.\n\nIn Example 0's row 1's last element (position 18) is a 0. Its left neighbor is 5 (position 17), but no right neighbor (end of row). So only one adjacent 5. But in the output, it's replaced by 4. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are placed in positions where the 0 has exactly two adjacent 5s (either horizontally or vertically). But this would require checking neighbors. For example, a 0 with 5 on left and right (two neighbors) would be replaced. Or a 0 with 5 above and below. But in Example 0's row 1's last 0, it has only one neighbor (left 5), so it wouldn't qualify. Yet it's replaced.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's think of another approach: comparing the input and output for each example to see the transformation.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 4s are located where there are 0s in the input that are adjacent to 5s in certain ways. For example, in row 1's last element, the 0 is replaced with 4. Looking at the surrounding elements in the input:\n\nRow 1's last element is 0. The element to the left is 5 (position 17). The element below (row 2's same column) is 0. The element in row 0's same column is 5 (since row 0 ends with 0,5,5). So column 18 in row 0 is 5. So perhaps the 0 in row 1, column 18 is between 5s vertically (row 0 and row 2) in column 18? But row 2's column 18 is 0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the 0 in row 1, column 18 is adjacent to a 5 in the same row (left) and in the row above (row 0, column 18 is 5). So two 5s adjacent (left and above). Maybe this triggers the replacement.\n\nBut this is speculative. Let's look for a pattern that can explain all the examples.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the 4s appear in positions where the input 0 is part of a \"path\" of 5s. For example, in Example 0's row 7, the 0s between two 5s in the row are replaced by 4s, creating a path of 4s between the 5s. So the transformation is converting certain 0s into 4s to create a connected path of 4s between 5s.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s are replacing 0s that are part of a \"doorway\" between 5s. But this is vague.\n\nAnother possible approach: think of the input as representing a grid where 5s are walls, and 0s are empty spaces. The transformation is replacing certain 0s (like those that are dead-ends or part of a specific structure) with 4s. For example, dead-end paths might be replaced. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s could be part of a maze-like pattern where certain 0s are marked as part of a solution path. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, considering the numerical values: 4 is one less than 5. Maybe the rule is that a 0 is replaced by 4 if it is adjacent to a 5 in a certain direction. For example, if a 0 has a 5 to the east (right) or south (below), it becomes 4. But checking this:\n\nIn Example 1's row 5, the 0s at positions 4-6 are replaced by 4s. Each has a 5 to the west (position 3) and east (position 7). So both directions have 5s. So perhaps the 0 is between two 5s horizontally.\n\nBut again, in Example 0's row 1, the 0s between 5s are not replaced. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s are replacing 0s that are surrounded by 5s in a diamond shape. For example, 5s to the north, south, east, and west. But this isn't the case in the examples.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the pattern is that any 0 that is between two 5s in the same row, regardless of the number of intervening 0s, is replaced by 4. However, the example where this doesn't happen (Example 0's row 1) must have an explanation.\n\nWait, looking again at Example 0's row 1 input: [5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nThe 0s between position 1 (5) and position 5 (5) are positions 2-4. But these 0s are not replaced. However, in the same row, there are 5s at positions 5-8. So perhaps the rule is that the 0s must be between two 5s and there are no other 5s between the left and right 5s. For example, if there's a left 5 and a right 5 with only 0s in between, then those 0s become 4s. But if there are other 5s between them, then they are not replaced.\n\nIn Example 0's row 1, between position 1 and 5, there are 0s, but position 5 is a 5 followed by more 5s. So maybe the rule requires that the left and right 5s are the only 5s in that segment. For example, if you have a left 5, followed by some 0s, followed by a right 5, and no other 5s in between, then replace the 0s with 4s. But in Example 0's row 1, positions 1 is 5, positions 2-4 are 0s, position 5 is 5, and positions 5-8 are all 5s. So between the left 5 (position 1) and right 5 (position 5), there are 0s, but there are other 5s after position 5. So perhaps the rule is that the 0s must be between two 5s and there are no other 5s beyond the right 5 in that direction. This is getting too convoluted.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to identify that 4s are replacing 0s that are between two 5s in the same row, and to apply that rule to the test input.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nNo 0s between two 5s in the same row. So no changes.\n\nRow 1: same as row 0. No changes.\n\nRow 2: [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nThe 0s between positions 3-6 and 8-17. The 5 is at position 2 and 7. So between 5s in positions 2 and 7, there are 0s (positions 3-6). These should be replaced by 4s.\n\nSo the output row would be: [5,5,5,4,4,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, no. Wait, in row 2, the 5s are at positions 0,1,2 and 7. So the 0s from 3 to 6 are between the 5 at position 2 and 7. So these 0s should become 4s.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\nAll are 5s except the first two 0s. But these 0s are not between two 5s in the same row. So no change.\n\nRow 4: [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\nThe 0s at positions 3-6 are between 5s at position 2 and 7. So these 0s become 4s. Also, the 0s at positions 8-13 are not between 5s. The 5 at position 14 is further to the right. But between 7 and 14, there are 0s and other elements. So only positions 3-6 are replaced.\n\nSo output row 4 becomes: [5,5,5,4,4,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\nNo 0s between two 5s in the same row. So no changes.\n\nRow 6: same as row 5. No changes.\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0]\nThe 0 at position 13 is replaced by 5,5,5,5. So in row 7, the 0s between position 7 and 13. Wait, let me check. The 5 is at position 7. Then in the same row, after position 7, there's a 0 at position 8. Then later, at positions 13-16, there are 5s. So the 0s between position 7 and 13 are positions 8-12. These 0s are between a 5 (position 7) and 5 (position 13). So all these 0s would become 4s.\n\nSo the output row would be: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]\nThe 0s at positions 10-12 are between 5 at position 9 (end of the 5,5,5,5,5 sequence) and 5 at position 13. So these 0s become 4s. Also, the 0 at position 14 is between 5 at position 13 and 5 at position 16. But position 14's neighbors: left is 5 (13), right is 0 (15). So only left has 5, right is 0. So no. Only the 0s between 9 and 13 (positions 10-12) become 4s.\n\nSo output row 8 becomes: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,4,5,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow 9: [5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5]\nThe 0s at positions 6-8 and 14-15. The 0s at 6-8 are between 5 at position 5 and 9. So they become 4s. The 0s at 14-15 are between 5 at position 13 and 17. So 14-15 are between 5s. So they become 4s.\n\nSo row 9's output: [5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5]\n\nRow 10: [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]\nThe 0s in position 2-4 are between 5 at position 1 and 5 at position 5. So they become 4s. Also, the 0s in positions 6-8 are between 5 at position 5 and 9. So replaced by 4s. The 0s at positions 10-12 are between 5 at position 9 and 13. Replaced by 4s. The 0 at position 15 is between 5 at position 14 and 16. So replaced by 4.\n\nSo output row 10 becomes: [0,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow 11: [0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0]\nThe 0s at positions 2-4 are between 5 at position 1 and 5 at position 5. They become 4s. The 0s at positions 10-12 are between 5 at position 9 and 13. So replaced by 4s.\n\nSo output row 11: [0,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow 12: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nThe 0s between position 1 (5) and 7 (5) are positions 2-6. These become 4s. So output row 12: [0,5,4,4,4,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 13: [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nThe 0s at positions 3-6 are between 5 at position 2 and 7. Replaced by 4s. So output: [5,5,5,4,4,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 14: [5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nThe 0s at positions 3-6 are between 5 at position 2 and 7. So replaced by 4s. So output: [5,0,5,4,4,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 15: [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nSame as row 13. Output: [5,5,5,4,4,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input, the 0s between two 5s in the same row are replaced by 4s.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a list of lists (probably representing a grid) with 0s and 5s. The output also has 0s and 5s, but some of them are replaced with 4s. Let me compare the input and output rows to see where the 4s appear.\n\nStarting with Example 0. Let's look at the input and output rows. For instance, in the second input row of Example 0, the input is [5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], and the output is the same except the last element is 4. Wait, no. Wait, in the output, the original 5s are sometimes replaced with 4s. Let me see more carefully.\n\nLooking at the first input row of Example 0, the output is the same as the input. The second input row's output changes the last element from 0 to 4. Wait, no. Let me check. The input row is [5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0], and the output is [5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4]. Oh right, the last element changes from 0 to 4. Wait, no, the input's last element is 0, and output is 4. Hmm. But that's a 0 changing to 4. But in other parts, like in the third input row, some 0s become 4s. For example, the third input row in Example 0's input is [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0], and the output becomes [4,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,...]. So the first element changes from 0 to 4, and the sixth and seventh elements (0s) become 4s. So maybe it's about replacing certain 0s with 4s based on their position relative to 5s.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The fifth input row is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0], and the output is [0,0,0,5,4,4,4,5,...]. So the 0s between the 5s in positions 3 and 7 (assuming 0-based indexing) are replaced with 4s. So maybe whenever there's a 5 on both ends of a sequence of 0s, those 0s become 4s. But how? Let's see. In that row, the 5 is at index 3 and 7. The 0s at indices 4,5,6 become 4s. So maybe horizontal runs of 0s between two 5s are replaced with 4s. Or vertical? Or maybe any 0 that is adjacent to 5s in certain ways.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about creating a border. For example, 4s are used to fill areas that are enclosed by 5s. Maybe the 0s that are surrounded by 5s in some way become 4s. But in the first example's second row, the last element changes from 0 to 4. The previous element is a 5. Wait, maybe it's the 0s that are to the right of a 5 but followed by 5s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, the 4s are replacing 0s that are in the interior of a structure made by 5s. Like, if there's a closed shape made by 5s, the 0s inside become 4s. That's similar to flood fill. So the pattern might be that 0s that are completely enclosed by 5s (horizontally and vertically) are replaced with 4s. But how to check that.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the third input row: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0]. The output is [4,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,...]. So the first 0 is replaced with 4, the two 0s in the middle are replaced with 4s. Maybe those 0s are adjacent to 5s but in a certain position. Or perhaps it's a horizontal line where 0s are between two 5s. Wait, the first element is 0, followed by 5s. Then after the 5s, there are 0s. So maybe if a 0 is adjacent to a 5 on the left and right? Not exactly. Maybe in the first element's case, the 0 is between a non-5 (since it's the start) and 5s. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking for cells where the cell is 0 and has a 5 to the left and right in the same row. For example, in Example 1's fifth row input: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]. The output replaces the 0s between the two 5s (indices 3 and 7) with 4s. So the 0s at 4,5,6 become 4. So perhaps in a row, any 0s that are between two 5s (horizontally) get replaced. But how about vertically? Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 2's third input row, the input starts with [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0]. The output is [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,4,5,0]. The 0s between the 5 and 5 (since after the 0s there's a 5?) Wait, in that input row, after the 0s at positions 12-14, there's a 5 at 15. So the 0s are between a 5 (from the earlier part) and another 5. So they get replaced with 4s. So this seems to support the horizontal replacement.\n\nBut in Example 0's third row, the first 0 is replaced with 4, but there's a 5 to the right of it. Like the row is [0,5,5,...]. So the 0 is followed by 5s. So maybe any 0 that is adjacent (to the right) to a 5, but not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is replacing 0s that are to the right of a 5 in the same row and followed by another 5. Or perhaps the 0s are enclosed between 5s in the same row. Let's take the example from Example 1's fifth row. The input is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]. The output replaces the three 0s between the 5 at index 3 and 7 (positions 3 and 7) with 4s. So in the same row, between two 5s, the 0s become 4s. Similarly, in Example 0's third row, the two 0s in the middle (indices 6 and 7) are replaced with 4s. Looking at the input row, those 0s are between 5s. Let's check the input row: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,...]. So after the 0s (indices 6 and 7) there's a 5 again. So between 5 at index 5 and 8, there are 0s which become 4s.\n\nBut then in Example 0's second input row: [5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0], the output is [5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,4]. The last element changes from 0 to 4. Why? The previous elements are 5 at index 17 and the last element is 0. So perhaps there's a 5 to the left and the end of the row? Or maybe the 0 is at the end and preceded by a 5. Maybe the rule is that 0s that are at the end of the row and preceded by a 5 are replaced with 4. But in Example 0's second row's output, the last element is 4. So input was 0, output 4. The element before that is 5. So maybe 0s that are preceded by a 5 in the same row and are at the end of the row get replaced.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent with other examples. Let's check other instances. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the last element of the input is 0, but the output is 4. The input is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]. Output is [0,0,0,5,4,4,4,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,4]. So the last element is 0 to 4, but the previous element is 5. So maybe any 0 that is immediately after a 5 in the same row is replaced with 4. But that's not the case in other parts. Like in the third row of Example 0's input: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,...], the first 0 is followed by 5s. In the output, the first 0 becomes 4, but the 0s at positions 6 and 7 are also replaced. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s are replacing 0s that are adjacent (either left or right) to a 5. But in that case, many more 0s would be replaced. So maybe it's more specific.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 4s are replacing 0s that are part of a \"corridor\" between 5s. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the 0s between two 5s in the same row are replaced. But also, looking at vertical columns. Let me check another example.\n\nTake Example 2's fifth input row: [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0]. Output is [5,5,5,5,4,4,5,0,...]. So the 0s between 5s in positions 3 and 6 are replaced with 4s. So in the row, the 0s are between 5s. So perhaps, in a row, any consecutive 0s that are between two 5s (regardless of distance) are replaced with 4s. So the rule is: In each row, any sequence of 0s that starts and ends with a 5 in the same row is replaced with 4s.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's second row input: [5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0]. The output changes the last element to 4. Let's see. The row starts with 5,5, then 0s, then 5,5,5,5, then 0s, then 5, 0s, 5, and ends with 0. So the last 0 is preceded by 5. So according to the rule, if a 0 is preceded by 5 and is at the end of the row, maybe it's considered part of a sequence. But how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s are placed wherever a 0 is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a 5. But in that case, almost all 0s would be replaced. But in the output examples, only certain 0s are replaced. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe 4s are replacing 0s that are enclosed by 5s in a certain way, perhaps forming a rectangle. Let's look at Example 1's input. The fifth row has 5s at positions 3 and 7, and between them are 0s. Those are replaced with 4s. So if the 5s form the left and right borders, the 0s inside become 4s. But how to verify.\n\nIn Example 2's third row input: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0]. The output replaces the three 0s with 4s. So after the 5s, there's a 5 at position 15. So the 0s are between the 5 at position 11 and 15. But the 0s are followed by a 5. So perhaps any 0s that are between two 5s in the same row, regardless of distance, are replaced. So the rule is: For each row, every run of 0s that is flanked by 5s on both ends (in the same row) is replaced with 4s. Additionally, if a 0 is at the end of a row and is preceded by a 5, it's also replaced. But in Example 0's second row, the last element is 0 preceded by 5 (element 17 is 5, element 18 is 0). So in the output, that 0 becomes 4. But in the same example's first row, the output doesn't have any 4s. So maybe the first row's 0s are not between two 5s.\n\nWait, let's check the first row of Example 0's input: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5]. The output is the same. So the 0s in positions 0-13 are followed by a 5 at 13. Then there's a 0 at 14, which is between 5 at 13 and 5 at 17 and 18. But in the output, those 0s are not replaced. So why? Because the 0 at 14 is between two 5s (13 and 17) but maybe not directly adjacent. Or maybe the rule is that the 0s have to be directly between two 5s in the same row, like the 0s are sandwiched between two 5s. So if there's a 5 on both the left and right of a 0 in the same row, then it's replaced. But that would mean only individual 0s between two 5s. But in Example 1's fifth row, the 0s are between two 5s and are replaced even though there are multiple 0s. So the rule must be that any sequence of 0s in a row that starts with a 5 and ends with a 5, even if there are multiple 5s in between.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any 0 in a row that is after a 5 and before another 5 (i.e., between two 5s) is replaced with a 4, regardless of how many 5s are in between.\n\nBut in Example 0's third row input: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0]. The output replaces the first 0 with 4, the next two 0s with 4, and the last 0 with 4. The first 0 is preceded by nothing (start of the row) and followed by 5s. So according to that, the 0 is only after a 5 if there's a 5 to the left. Wait, no, the first element is 0, then 5. So the 0 is followed by 5. So maybe 0s that are followed by a 5 and preceded by a 5? That doesn't fit here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about horizontal runs of 0s that are enclosed by 5s. For example, in a row, if there's a run of 0s that starts and ends with a 5, then replace those 0s with 4s. But also, if a 0 is at the end of a row and preceded by a 5, replace it. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's second row, the last 0 is after a 5 (position 17 is 5, 18 is 0). So it's replaced with 4. But why? Because it's a 0 at the end of the row, preceded by a 5, and maybe there's no 5 after it, but the rule is that if a 0 is after a 5 and there's no 5 after, but it's at the end, then replace. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 0s that are in positions where there are 5s both before and after in the same row, but not necessarily immediately adjacent. So any 0 that is between two 5s in the same row, regardless of distance, becomes a 4.\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's third row. The input row starts with 0, then a lot of 5s, then two 0s, then 5s again. So the first 0 is before the 5s but not between two 5s. But in the output, it's replaced with 4. So that contradicts the previous idea.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that any 0 that is part of a horizontal or vertical line of 0s that is enclosed by 5s on both ends. For example, if there's a horizontal line of 0s between two 5s, those become 4s. Similarly, vertically, but how would that work.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's fifth row, the 0s between two 5s horizontally become 4s. In Example 2's fifth row, the 0s between 5s in the same row become 4s. But in Example 0's third row, the first 0 is replaced, but there's no 5 before it. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are replacing 0s that are to the right of a 5 in the same row, regardless of what comes after. But then in Example 0's second row, the last element is 0 and is after a 5, so it's replaced. But in the same row's earlier elements, there are 0s after 5s that are not replaced, like the 0s after the first 5,5. For example, in the input row [5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0], the 0s after the first two 5s are not replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are replacing 0s that are in regions where there are 5s both above and below. But this would require checking vertically. Let's see. For instance, in Example 1's fifth row, the 0s that become 4s are between two 5s in the same row. Maybe vertically, but in Example 0's third row, the first 0 is replaced with 4. Looking vertically, in that column, what's above and below? Not sure. Maybe that's too complicated.\n\nAnother idea: The 4s are replacing 0s that are adjacent to 5s but only in certain directions. For example, if a 0 has a 5 to the left and right (horizontally adjacent), it's replaced with 4. Let's check. In Example 1's fifth row, the 0s between 5s are adjacent to 5 on left and right. So replaced with 4. But in Example 0's third row's first element (0 replaced with 4), the 0 has a 5 to the right but not to the left. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, if a 0 has a 5 to the left and right in the same row (not necessarily adjacent), then replace with 4. So any 0 that is between two 5s in the same row. Let's test this. In Example 0's second row, the last element is 0. The previous element is 5. So no 5 after it, so not replaced. Wait, but in the output, it's replaced. Hmm. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that in each row, all 0s that are to the right of the first 5 are replaced with 4. But in Example 0's third row, the first 0 is followed by 5s. So the first 0 is to the left of the first 5 (which is at position 1). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are filling the 0s that are part of certain enclosed areas. For example, if a 0 is surrounded by 5s in all four directions (up, down, left, right), it becomes 4. But how to check that. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the 0s between two 5s horizontally are not surrounded by 5s vertically. So that wouldn't work.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me look for another pattern. The 4s in the output grids seem to form parts of what could be considered \"walls\" or maybe inner areas. For example, in Example 0's third row, the output has 4s where the input had 0s between 5s. This makes me think of a maze where the 5s are walls and the 0s are paths, and the 4s are indicating some kind of marking.\n\nWait, another approach: Looking at the outputs, the 4s seem to replace 0s that are in positions where they are adjacent to 5s but are part of certain structures. For example, in Example 0's second row, the last element is 0 followed by nothing (end of row), but in the output it's 4. The element before it is 5. So maybe the rule is that any 0 that is immediately after a 5 in the same row is replaced with 4. But then, in Example 0's third row, the first 0 is followed by a 5, so it's replaced. Similarly, the two 0s in positions 6 and 7 are followed by 5s (the next element is 5). Wait, in the third row input: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0]. The elements after the 0s at positions 6 and 7 are 5. So those 0s are followed by 5s. So according to this, those 0s are replaced with 4s. But the first 0 is followed by 5, so replaced. The last 0 is followed by nothing, but preceded by 5. So perhaps the rule is that any 0 that is preceded by a 5 or followed by a 5 in the same row is replaced with 4. But that would replace a lot of 0s.\n\nBut let's check Example 0's first input row: [0,0,...,5,0,0,0,5,5]. The output is same as input, no 4s. So in that row, the 5 is at position 13, followed by 0s and then 5s. But the 0s after the 5 (positions 14,15,16) are followed by 5s (positions 17 and 18 are 5). But those 0s are not replaced with 4s. So the previous idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace 0s that are between two 5s in the same row, regardless of other elements. For example, if a 0 is between two 5s, even if there are other 0s or 5s in between, then it's replaced. But how to define between.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps any 0 that has a 5 somewhere to the left and a 5 somewhere to the right in the same row is replaced with 4. Let's see. In Example 0's third row, the first 0 has 5s to the right but none to the left. So according to this, it wouldn't be replaced, but in the output it is replaced. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are replacing 0s that are adjacent to 5s in a certain direction, like to the right. For example, every 0 that is immediately to the right of a 5 is replaced with 4. Let's check. In Example 1's fifth row, the 0s after the 5 at position 3 are replaced. The 5 is at 3, and the next three 0s are replaced with 4. Then after the 5 at position 7, there's a 0 which is replaced. So yes, they are to the right of 5s. But in Example 0's second row, the last 0 is to the right of a 5 (position 17) and is replaced. So that fits. But what about Example 0's third row's first 0: it is followed by a 5 (position 1 is 5), so it's to the left of a 5. So if the rule is to replace 0s that are adjacent to 5s either left or right, then this would apply. But in Example 0's third row's first 0 is followed by a 5, so it's adjacent to the right. So replaced with 4. The two 0s in positions 6 and 7 are preceded by 5s (position 5 is 5) and followed by 5 (position 8). So they are between two 5s. So according to the adjacent rule, their right side is 5 (position 8), so they are replaced. But why are both replaced? If the rule is to replace any 0 that is to the left or right of a 5, then all 0s adjacent to 5s would be replaced. But in Example 0's second row, there are 0s after 5s that are not replaced. For example, after the first two 5s (positions 0 and 1), there are 0s (positions 2,3,4), which are to the right of 5s but are not replaced. So this contradicts the rule.\n\nHmm. This is getting tricky. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the 4s are replacing 0s that are part of certain shapes. For instance, if you look at the input grids, they might form letters or numbers, and the output is highlighting certain parts with 4s. But that's probably too vague.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input and output, the 4s seem to replace certain 0s that are near 5s. For example, in the third row of the input, the 0s are at the beginning and between two 5s. The output replaces those with 4s. So maybe the 4s are filling the 0s that are inside a structure formed by 5s. Like the 5s form a sort of loop or rectangle, and the 0s inside are filled with 4s. But how to determine that programmatically.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s are replacing 0s that are in regions that are enclosed by 5s on all four sides. But in Example 1's fifth row, the 0s are between two 5s horizontally, but not vertically enclosed. So that wouldn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, it's a combination of horizontal and vertical checks. For example, a 0 is replaced with 4 if it is between two 5s horizontally and also between two 5s vertically. But that would be very specific and perhaps not evident in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace every other 0 with 4 in certain conditions, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s are part of a path-following algorithm. Like, starting from the edges, any 0 that is reachable without crossing 5s is left as 0, and the 0s that are enclosed (not reachable from the edge) are replaced with 4s. This is similar to the \"surrounded regions\" problem in programming. Let's see. In Example 0's third row, the 0s are in the middle of 5s, so maybe they are enclosed. But in the input, it's a single row. So how to check vertical enclosure.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's fifth row, the 0s between the 5s are enclosed horizontally, but not vertically. But according to the output, they are replaced. So this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s are part of a digit or letter that is being transformed. For example, the input is a 5-shaped figure and the output adds 4s to form a different character. But this is speculative.\n\nLet me try to find a different angle. Let's compare the input and output for each example and see what changes.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput rows where 0s are replaced with 4s:\n\nRow 1 (index 1): last element changes from 0 to 4.\n\nRow 2 (index 2): first 0 becomes 4, the two 0s later become 4,4.\n\nRow 3 (index 3): 0s at positions 6 and 7 become 4,4.\n\nRow 4 (index 4): 0s at positions 6 and 7 become 4,4.\n\nRow 5 (index 5): 0s at 6 and 7 become 4,4.\n\nRow 6 (index 6): same as row 5.\n\nRow 7 (index 7): 0s at positions 6 and 7 become 4,4.\n\nOther rows have no changes.\n\nSo the common change is that in rows where there are 0s that are between 5s in certain positions, they become 4s. For example, in row 2 of Example 0's input, the 0s are between 5s in the same row. The first 0 is at the start, then followed by 5s, so perhaps the first 0 is replaced because it's after a 5 from the previous row? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider looking at the grid as a 2D array and check the neighboring cells for each 0.\n\nFor each 0 in the input, if it has a 5 to the left and right in the same row, replace with 4. Or if it has a 5 above and below in the same column, replace with 4.\n\nTesting this:\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row, the 0s between 5s (positions 3 and 7) are replaced. Each of those 0s has 5 to the left and right in the same row, so replaced with 4.\n\nIn Example 0's third row, the 0s are between 5s in the same row. So replaced.\n\nBut for the first 0 in row 2 of Example 0's input, it's followed by 5s but there's no 5 to the left. So according to this rule, it wouldn't be replaced, but it is replaced in the output. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is more complex. Perhaps the 0s are replaced with 4 if they are adjacent to a 5 in any direction, but only if they are not on the border of the grid. Or if they are part of a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s are replacing 0s that are part of a \"U\" shape of 5s. Like, if there are 5s on the left, right, and bottom, then the 0 is replaced. But this is hard to verify.\n\nAnother idea: The transformation involves replacing 0s that are part of a diagonal with 5s. But I don't see diagonal patterns in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s are part of a numbering system. For example, each time a 5 appears in a certain pattern, the following 0s are replaced with 4s. But this is vague.\n\nMaybe the key is to look at the positions where 0s are replaced with 4s and see if there's a common pattern in their indices.\n\nFor Example 0's row 2: input is [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0]. Output is [4,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,...]. So the first 0 (index 0) becomes 4. Then the two 0s at indices 6 and 7 become 4,4. The last 0 at index 18 becomes 4.\n\nSo in this row, the 0s are at the beginning, middle, and end. The beginning 0 is followed by 5s. The middle 0s are between 5s (positions 5 is 5, position 8 is 5). The last 0 is preceded by 5 (position 17 is 5).\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's output, the 4s are only present in certain rows and columns, suggesting that the replacement is done per row, not considering other rows.\n\nSo per row, the rule is: For each 0 in the row, if there is a 5 somewhere to the left and a 5 somewhere to the right of the 0 in the same row, then replace the 0 with 4. Additionally, if a 0 is at the end of the row and there is a 5 to the left, replace it with 4.\n\nLet's test this rule.\n\nIn Example 0's row 1 (index 1), the last element is 0. There's a 5 to the left (position 17), so replaced with 4.\n\nIn row 2 (index 2), the first 0: to the left there's no 5, to the right there are 5s. So according to the rule, not replaced. But in output, it is replaced. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. Another variation: Any 0 that has a 5 to the left in the same row, regardless of what's to the right. Or to the right.\n\nWait, in Example 0's row 2, the first 0 is followed by 5s. So maybe any 0 that is followed by a 5 in the same row is replaced.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 1, the 0s at positions 2,3,4 are followed by a 5 at position 5. But they are not replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, any 0 that is preceded by a 5 and followed by a 5 in the same row is replaced with 4.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row, the 0s between 5s are preceded and followed by 5s in the same row. So replaced.\n\nIn Example 0's row 2's first 0: not preceded by 5, but followed by 5. Not replaced according to this rule. But in output, it is replaced. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that any 0 that is either preceded by a 5 or followed by a 5 in the same row is replaced with 4. So even if only one side has a 5.\n\nIn Example 0's row 2's first 0: followed by 5, so replaced.\n\nIn row 1's last element: preceded by 5, so replaced.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row's 0s: preceded and followed by 5s, so replaced.\n\nIn Example 0's row 3: 0s at 6 and 7 are preceded by 5 (position 5 is 5) and followed by 5 (position 8 is 5). So replaced.\n\nThis seems to fit. Let's check other cases.\n\nIn Example 0's row 0: all 0s except for some 5s. The 0s after the 5 at position 13 are not replaced. For example, position 14 is 0, followed by 5 at 17 and 18. So according to the rule, position 14's 0 is followed by 5 (even if not immediately), so it should be replaced. But in the output, it's not. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the 0 must be immediately preceded or followed by a 5 in the same row.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's row 1: the last element is 0, immediately preceded by 5 (position 17). So replaced.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row: 0s between 5s are immediately preceded by 5 and followed by 5. So replaced.\n\nIn Example 0's row 2's first 0: followed by a 5 (position 1). So replaced.\n\nIn Example 0's row 2's 0s at positions 6 and 7: preceded by 5 (position 5 is 5) and followed by 5 (position 8 is 5). So replaced.\n\nIn Example 0's row 0: the 0 at position 14 is not immediately followed by 5. The next 5 is at position 17, which is three positions away. So according to the rule, it's not replaced, which matches the output.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the rule could be: Replace any 0 with 4 if it is immediately preceded by a 5 or immediately followed by a 5 in the same row. So, for each row, check each 0. If the previous element is 5 or the next element is 5, replace with 4.\n\nTesting this rule:\n\nExample 0's row 1: last element is 0. Previous element is 5. So replaced.\n\nExample 1's fifth row: 0s between 5s. Each 0 has previous element 5 (for the first 0 in the sequence) or next element 5 (for the last 0 in the sequence). Wait, no. The sequence is [5,0,0,0,5]. The middle 0s are between two 0s. So the first 0 in the sequence is preceded by 5 and followed by 0. The next 0 is preceded by 0 and followed by 0. The third 0 is preceded by 0 and followed by 5. So according to the rule, only the first and third 0s would be replaced. But in the output, all three are replaced with 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this rule would only replace the first and third 0s in the sequence. But in the output, all are replaced. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternative rule: Replace any 0 that is adjacent (previous or next) to a 5 in the same row. So even if there's a 5 in either direction, replace.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row's 0s between 5s: each 0 is between two 5s. The first 0 is preceded by 5, the next two are preceded by 0 and followed by 0, but the last 0 is followed by 5. So according to the adjacent rule, only the first and last 0s would be replaced. But in the output, all are replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's look at another example. Example 2's fifth row input is [5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0]. The output is [5,5,5,5,4,4,5,0,...]. So the 0s at positions 4 and 5 are replaced with 4s. The first 0 (position 4) is preceded by 5 (position 3) and followed by 0 (position 5). The second 0 (position 5) is preceded by 0 and followed by 5 (position 6). So according to the adjacent rule, position 4's 0 is replaced (preceded by 5), position 5's 0 is replaced (followed by 5). So replaced. So the output has 4s for both. Which matches.\n\nBut in Example 1's fifth row, the three 0s between the 5s would have the first 0 preceded by 5, the middle 0s preceded by 0 and followed by 0, and the last 0 followed by 5. So according to the adjacent rule, the first and last 0s would be replaced, but not the middle one. But in the output, all three are replaced. So this contradicts.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that any 0 that is part of a consecutive sequence of 0s that is flanked by 5s on both ends in the same row. So even if the 0s are in the middle of the sequence, as long as the entire sequence is between two 5s, all 0s are replaced. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the three 0s are between 5s, so all are replaced. In Example 2's fifth row, the two 0s are between 5s, so replaced. In Example 0's row 2, the first 0 is not between two 5s (only followed by 5s), but it's replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be: For each row, scan from left to right. Whenever a 5 is encountered, replace all 0s after it until another 5 is encountered. So in Example 1's fifth row, after the first 5 (position 3), the next three 0s are replaced until the next 5 (position 7). Also, if there's a 5 followed by 0s at the end of the row, replace those 0s.\n\nThis seems to fit. Let's test:\n\nExample 0's row 1: [5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0]. The first 5 is at 0. Then after that, there are 0s (positions 2-4) until the next 5 at position 5. So replace positions 2-4 with 4s. But in the output, these 0s are not replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in the output of Example 0's row 1, the only change is the last 0 to 4. So this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: The 4s are replacing 0s that are between two 5s in the same row, but not necessarily adjacent. So in a row, if there's a 5, then some 0s, then another 5, replace all 0s in between. Also, if a 5 is followed by 0s at the end of the row, replace those 0s.\n\nFor Example 0's row 1: [5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0].\n\nLooking for sequences between two 5s:\n\nFrom index 0 (5), then 5 at index 1. No 0s in between. Then 0s from 2-4, followed by 5 at 5. So replace 2-4 with 4s. But in the output, these are not replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut the output only replaces the last 0 (index 18) to 4. So perhaps the rule is to replace 0s that are after the last 5 in the row.\n\nWait, in Example 0's row 1, the last 0 is after the last 5 (position 17 is 5, then 18 is 0). So replace that 0. Similarly, in row 2's last 0, it's after the last 5 (position 17 is 5, then 18 is 0). So replaced.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row, the 0s between 5s are replaced. So this could be two rules: replace 0s between two 5s in the same row, and replace 0s after the last 5 in the row.\n\nThis might explain some of the replacements.\n\nExample 0's row 2: the first 0 is before any 5s, so not replaced. But according to the output, it is replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be to replace all 0s that are after the first 5 in the row and before the next 5, and also any 0s after the last 5 in the row.\n\nExample 0's row 1:\n\n5s are at positions 0,1,5-8,13,17,18. Between 5s:\n\n- Between 1 and 5: 0s at 2-4. According to the rule, replace with 4s. But in the output, they are not replaced.\n\nBut in the output, these 0s remain 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's try to think of the 4s as replacements for 0s that are part of horizontal \"tunnels\" between 5s. So whenever there's a 5 followed by some 0s and then another 5 in the same row, replace the 0s with 4s.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row: the 0s between the two 5s are replaced. In Example 0's row 2's middle 0s (positions 6 and 7) are between two 5s (positions 5 and 8), so replaced. The first 0 in row 2 is not between two 5s but is replaced. So why?\n\nLooking at the output for Example 0's row 2: the first 0 is replaced with 4, but there's no 5 before it. So the previous idea doesn't apply. So perhaps there's another condition.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's row 2's output: the first element is 4, which was a 0 in the input. The next elements are 5s. So perhaps the rule is that if a 0 is followed by a 5, it's replaced with 4. So the first 0 is followed by a 5 (position 1) and is replaced. The two 0s at positions 6 and 7 are each followed by a 5 (position 8). The last 0 is preceded by a 5 (position 17) and is replaced.\n\nSo the rule could be: For each 0 in a row, replace it with 4 if it is followed by a 5 or preceded by a 5.\n\nThis would explain:\n\n- Example 1's fifth row: the three 0s between 5s are preceded by a 5 (first 0), followed by a 5 (third 0), and the middle 0 has neither. Wait, but according to this rule, only the first and third 0s would be replaced. But in the output, all three are replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that if a 0 is in a position where either the previous or next element is a 5, then replace with 4.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row:\n\n- The three 0s are between two 5s. The first 0 is preceded by 5 and followed by 0. So only the first 0 is replaced. The second 0 is preceded and followed by 0. Not replaced. The third 0 is followed by 5 and preceded by 0. So only the third is replaced. But in the output, all three are replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the 4s are used to fill the 0s that are part of the same connected region as certain edges. Or perhaps the pattern is to replace every second 0 in a row with 4.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 4s added corresponds to the number of 5s in the row. For example, the more 5s in the row, the more 4s. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s are part of a shift in the grid. For example, shifting the 5s to the right and replacing the original positions with 4s. But this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's row 2 input: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,...]. Output is [4,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,...]. The 0s are replaced with 4s where they are adjacent to 5s, but only in certain directions. Maybe the 4s are replacing 0s that are either to the left or right of a 5, but not both.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s are replacing 0s that are part of a horizontal line between two 5s. For example, if two 5s are in the same row with 0s in between, replace those 0s with 4s. This would explain Example 1's fifth row, Example 0's row 2's middle 0s, and Example 2's fifth row. But what about the first 0 in Example 0's row 2 and the last 0 in Example 0's row 1.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is to replace 0s that are between two 5s in the same row, but also 0s that are after a 5 and are at the end of the row. So:\n\nFor each row:\n\n- For every pair of 5s, replace the 0s between them with 4s.\n\n- Also, replace any 0s that come after the last 5 in the row with 4s.\n\nThis could explain:\n\nIn Example 0's row 1: the last 0 is after the last 5 (position 17 is 5, position 18 is 0). So replaced with 4.\n\nIn Example 0's row 2: between the 5 at position 5 and 8, the 0s are replaced. Also, the 0s after the last 5 (position 17 and 18?) No, in row 2's output, the last element is 4, but the input's last element is 0. So maybe it's considered after the last 5.\n\nBut in row 2's input, the last element is 0. The 5s end at position 17. So the last 0 is after the last 5, so replaced.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row: the 0s between 5s are replaced, and the last 0 in the row (position 15) is replaced because it's after the last 5.\n\nThis seems to fit some cases but not all.\n\nFor Example 0's row 2's first 0: it's before the first 5, so not replaced according to this rule, but in the output it is replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm running out of ideas. Let me try to sum up:\n\nThe pattern seems to involve replacing certain 0s with 4s. The common thread in the training examples is that 0s which are in between two 5s in the same row, or at the end of a row after a 5, are replaced with 4s. Additionally, sometimes 0s at the beginning of a row before a 5 are replaced, as in Example 0's row 2. This suggests that the rule may be to replace 0s that are either between two 5s in the same row, or at the start/end of a row and adjacent to a 5.\n\nBut this isn't entirely consistent across all examples, especially the first 0 in Example 0's row 2.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that 4s are placed in positions where a 0 is present in the input and there's a 5 in the same position in the previous or next row. For example, vertical adjacency. But this would require checking other rows.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's row 2, the first 0 is replaced with 4. If in the row above (row 1), there's a 5 in the same column, then it's replaced. Looking at row 1's column 0: 5. So maybe this is why. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s are placed where there are 5s in the cell diagonally adjacent. But this is hard to verify without seeing all rows.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling to find the exact rule, perhaps the best approach is to generalize the pattern as replacing 0s that are between two 5s in the same row (including the start and end of the row if preceded or followed by a 5).\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nEach row in the test input needs to be processed by replacing 0s that are between two 5s in the same row, or at the start/end of a row with a 5 adjacent.\n\nLet's look at the test input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLooking for 0s between 5s or at start/end with adjacent 5s. The only 5 is at position 7. The 0s after position 7 are not followed by any 5 in this row. So according to the rule, no replacement. So output row remains the same.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSame as row 0. Output remains the same.\n\nRow 2: [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nIn this row, the 5s are at positions 0-2 and 7. The 0s between positions 3-6 are between 5s (positions 2 and 7). So replace these 0s with 4s. Also, after the 5 at position 7, there are 0s. So if we're replacing 0s after the last 5, those would be replaced. But according to the training examples, it's possible that only the 0s between 5s are replaced. So positions 3-6 are between 5s. So replace those 0s (positions 3-6) with 4s.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nThis row has 5s from position 2 onwards. The 0s are at positions 0 and 1. They are not between any 5s. So no replacement.\n\nRow 4: [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nLooking for 0s between 5s. The 5s are at positions 0-2, 7, and 14. The 0s between positions 3-6 (between 5 at 2 and 7) are replaced with 4s. Then after 5 at 7, there are 0s until position 13. Are there any 5s after 7 in this row? Yes, at 14. So 0s between 7 and 14 are positions 8-13. But in this row, the 0s from 8-13 are not between 5s (position 7 and 14 are 5s). So replace those 0s with 4s. But wait, between 7 and 14, positions 8-13 are 0s. So according to the rule, replace them. Also, the 0 at position 15 is between 5 at 14 and 16 (but 16 is 0). So no. So in row 4, the 0s from 3-6 and 8-13 are between 5s. So replace those with 4s. But the test output for row 4 would be [5,5,5,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,0,0,0].\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n5s at positions 7 and 14. The 0s between them (positions 8-13) are replaced with 4s. So the output row becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,0,0,0].\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nSame as row 5: 0s between 7 and 14 are replaced.\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0]\n\n5 at position 7, then 0s, then 5s at 13-16. The 0s between 7 and 13 are positions 8-12. Replace with 4s. So output row would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,0]. But the last 0 is not after any 5, so remains 0.\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]\n\nLooking for 0s between 5s. The 5s start at position 5-9, then 13, 16. The 0s between 9 and 13 are positions 10-12. So replace with 4s. Also, after 13, the 0 at position 14 is between 13 (5) and 15 (0), so no. So output row becomes [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,4,5,0,0,5,0].\n\nRow 9: [5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5]\n\nThe 0s between positions 6-8 are between 5s (position 5 and 9). So replace with 4s. The 0s at positions 14 and 15 are between 5 at 13 and 16. So replace them with 4s. So output row becomes [5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5].\n\nRow 10: [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0]\n\nLooking for 0s between 5s. The 5s are at positions 1,5,9,13,16. The 0s between 1 and 5 (positions 2-4) are replaced. The 0s between 5 and 9 (positions 6-8) are replaced. The 0s between 9 and 13 (positions 10-12) are replaced. The 0s after 13 (positions 14-15) are between 13 and 16 (5 at 13 and 16). So replace them. So output row becomes [0,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,4,4,5,0].\n\nRow 11: [0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,4,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0]\n\nAssuming there's a typo in the test input for row 11 (it has a 4 in the input which might be a mistake, but assuming it's correct). The 5s are at positions 1,5-7,9,13-16. The 0s between 1 and 5 (positions 2-4) are replaced. The 0s after 9 (positions 10-12) are between 9 and 13. So replace them. The 0 at position 17 is after 16 (5), so replaced. So output row becomes [0,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,4,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,4].\n\nRow 12: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe 5s are at positions 1 and 7. The 0s between them (positions 2-6) are replaced with 4s. So output row becomes [0,5,4,4,4,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 13: [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSimilar to row 2. The 0s between positions 3-6 (between 5s at 2 and 7) are replaced with 4s. So output becomes [5,5,5,4,4,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 14: [5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe 5s are at 0,2,7. The 0s between 0 and 2 (position 1) is replaced. Also, the 0s between 2 and 7 (positions 3-6) are replaced. So output becomes [5,4,5,4,4,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 15: [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSame as row 13: [5,5,5,4,4,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nPutting it all together, this would be the expected output based on the rule of replacing 0s between two 5s in the same row and after the last 5 in the row. But I'm not entirely confident. However, given the time constraints, this is the best pattern I can derive.",
