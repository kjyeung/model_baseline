        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. The problem is about transforming an input list of lists into an output list of lists. Let's look at the training examples to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 0: The input has several rows with numbers like 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, and so on. The output seems to have fewer rows. For instance, the input has 17 rows, and the output has 9. Hmm, so maybe there's a way rows are being merged or combined. Looking at the output rows, some of them have values that are combinations of the input rows. For example, in the input, there are two rows with [0,0,0,3,3,0...] and the output has those combined into one row with 3,3 and 2,2. Wait, no, actually in the output, the same rows are present but maybe shifted? Not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe it's about removing the first and last elements of each row. Looking at the input rows in Example 0, each row has 17 elements. The output rows have 14 elements. So 17 minus 3 equals 14? Wait, 17-3=14. Let's check. For instance, the first input row is [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0], which has 17 elements. The output row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4], which is 14 elements. So it looks like the first two and last element are removed. Wait, original row length is 17, output is 14. 17-3=14. Let's see: taking elements starting from index 2 to index -2 (exclusive). For the first input row, if we remove the first two zeros and the last zero, we get 4 followed by 13 zeros (but original row after first two is 4, then 12 zeros, then 4, 0. So after removing first two and last one, the 4 is at the start, then 12 elements (from index 2 to 15, since 17 elements, indices 0-16). Let me check: index 0 and 1 are removed (the first two 0s), then the last element (index 16) is removed. So the remaining elements are from index 2 to 15. How many elements is that? 15-2+1=14 elements. Yes. So that's part of the transformation: trimming each row by removing the first two and last element.\n\nBut looking at the output rows, that's not all. Because in Example 0's output, the first row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]. The original input's first row after trimming would be [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4] (since original is [0,0,4,0,0,0,...,4,0], trimming first two gives starting at 4, then up to before the last element, which is 0. So the trimmed row would end with 4? Wait, let me count. Original first input row has elements:\n\nIndices 0-16: 17 elements.\n\nOriginal row: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nAfter removing first two (indices 0 and 1) and last one (index 16), we take indices 2 to 15.\n\nIndices 2: 4, then 0s until index 15, which is the 4. So the trimmed row would be [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]. Wait, how many elements is that? Let's count:\n\nIndices 2 to 15: 14 elements. Original indices 2 is 4, index 15 is 4 (since original input row ends with ...,4,0], so index 15 is 4. So the trimmed row is [4,0,0,...,4]. But in the output, the first row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4], which is 14 elements. So that matches. So trimming the first two and last elements of each row.\n\nBut wait, looking at the output for Example 0, the output rows are shorter, but there are also fewer rows. The input has 17 rows, the output has 9. So maybe rows are also being merged or combined in some way. Let's see. How are the input rows transformed into output rows in terms of the number of rows?\n\nLooking at the input and output rows for Example 0:\n\nInput rows: 17 rows (indices 0-16).\n\nOutput rows: 9 rows. So perhaps merging pairs of rows, but not exactly. Let's check the rows:\n\nIn the input, rows 2 and 3 are [0,0,0,3,3,0,...], same for rows 6 and 7 (1s). In the output, these become single rows. So perhaps adjacent duplicate rows are merged by summing? Or perhaps combining them into one row by taking the maximum or some other operation.\n\nWait, in Example 0, input rows 2 and 3 are identical. The output rows 2 and 3 are the same as the input rows, but trimmed. So perhaps rows are grouped into pairs, and each pair is transformed into a single row. Let's see:\n\nInput has 17 rows. Output has 9. 17/2 is 8.5, so maybe the first row is kept as is, then groups of two? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe some rows are being removed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the central part of the input, but that doesn't fit. Let's check another example.\n\nExample 1's input has 17 rows (0-16), output has 7 rows. Wait, 17 rows input, output 7. So maybe the number of rows is being reduced by trimming. For example, in Example 0, input rows are 17, output 9. 17 - 8 =9? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the rows are being merged in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves taking the middle part of the input. Let's think of the input as a grid, and the output is a cropped version. But in Example 0, input is 17x17, output is 9x14. Wait, 17 rows and columns? Let me check the first example's input. Each row in the input is 17 elements. The output is 14 elements per row. So columns are being trimmed. For rows, the output has 9 rows. So input 17 rows, output 9. So that's 17 - 8=9. Maybe removing the first 4 and last 4 rows? Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input rows are 0-16. Output rows are 9. Let's count the input rows that become output. For example, the output's first row is the trimmed version of input row 0. Then the next output row is input row 1. Then output rows 2 and 3 correspond to input rows 2 and 3. But the output rows 4 and 5 are new. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by combining certain rows. For instance, in Example 0's output, rows 4 and 5 are [0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0] and the same again. Looking back at the input, perhaps rows 13,14,15 are merged. Input row 13: [0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Row 14: [0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Maybe combining these somehow. But the output rows 4 and 5 in the output of Example 0 have 1s arranged in a certain way. Hmm, maybe this is more complex than just trimming.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output is a kind of \"compression\" where consecutive identical rows are combined into a single row. But in Example 0, input rows 2 and 3 are identical and output rows 2 and 3 are the same. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for each example's input and output to see the transformation steps.\n\nExample 0's Input is a 17x17 grid. Output is 9x14. So both rows and columns are reduced. Columns are trimmed from 17 to 14 (removing first two and last one). Rows are trimmed from 17 to 9. How?\n\nLooking at the input rows and output rows:\n\nOutput rows for Example 0:\n\nRow 0: corresponds to input row 0 (trimmed columns).\n\nRow 1: input row 1 (trimmed columns, all zeros).\n\nRow 2 and 3: input rows 2 and 3 (same as output rows 2 and 3).\n\nThen output rows 4 and 5: perhaps input rows 6 and 7 (since they have 1s). Wait, input rows 6 and 7 have 1s in the middle, but output rows 4 and 5 have 1s arranged in a way that might be combining multiple input rows. Alternatively, maybe the output is taking certain rows and combining their values.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the output is a combination of the original grid after a certain transformation, such as a reflection or rotation. For example, maybe the output is a diamond shape taken from the input. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first and last elements (after trimming columns) and merging the middle rows in some pattern. For example, in Example 0's output, the first and last rows have 4s at the ends, which correspond to the input's first row's 4s after trimming. But in the input's first row, after trimming, the first element is 4 and the last is 4. So the output's first row is [4,0,...0,4].\n\nBut how are the middle rows generated? Let's take another example.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the output has 7 rows. The first output row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,4], which may correspond to the input rows 1 and 7, which have 4s. Then the next two rows correspond to input rows 2 and 3 (with 2s), then rows 4 and 5 (8s), etc. So perhaps the output is constructed by taking certain key rows from the input, trimming their columns, and combining them. But how are the rows selected?\n\nAlternatively, the number of output rows is roughly half the input rows, but not exactly. Example 0: 17 input to 9 output. 17 is an odd number, so (17-1)/2 +1=9. Maybe the output is every other row, starting from the middle. Wait, 17 rows: the middle row is 8 (0-based index 8). Then taking 4 rows above and 4 below, plus the middle row: 9 rows. Let's check Example 0's input rows. The middle row (index 8) is [0,0,4,0,...4,0]. In the output, this row is present as [4,0,...0,4], which is row 8 in the output. Then the output includes rows 0,1,2,3,6,7,8,13,14,15,16? No, the output has 9 rows. So perhaps it's taking the middle 9 rows. Let's count:\n\nInput rows 0-16 (17 rows). Middle row is 8. Taking 4 rows before and 4 after: rows 4 to 12? That's 9 rows. But in Example 0's output, the first row is input row 0's trimmed version. So that's not matching. So maybe that's not the approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output rows, maybe they are the rows that have non-zero elements. For Example 0's output, rows 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. But row 0 of the output is non-zero, but input row 0 has 4s. So maybe output rows are the ones that have non-zero elements after trimming. But in Example 0's input, row 1 is all zeros, and in the output, it's a row of zeros. But maybe the output is including all rows, but merging some. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is created by collapsing certain rows and columns. For example, in Example 0, the input has several pairs of identical rows, like rows 2 and 3, 6 and 7. The output rows for these pairs are the same as the input rows after trimming. So maybe when there are consecutive duplicate rows, they are kept as is. But how does that explain the number of rows in the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves mirroring the left and right parts of the grid. For instance, in Example 0's input, after trimming the columns, the middle part is mirrored. But looking at the output rows, they might have some symmetry.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's output, the rows with 1s (rows 4 and 5) have a pattern that seems to combine the values from the input's lower rows. For example, input rows 13 and 14 have 1s, and maybe they are combined into a wider pattern. Hmm, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of overlapping regions. For example, each output row is a combination of two input rows, but adding their values. Let's check. Take Example 0's output row 4: [0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]. Let's look at the input rows that might correspond. The input rows 13 and 14 are:\n\nRow 13: [0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nAfter trimming, row 13 becomes [1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the output row 4 starts with 0,1,1, etc. So maybe this is not a direct sum.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the output rows and see if they correspond to specific regions of the input. For example, maybe the output is a kind of \"compressed\" view where each output row represents a vertical slice of the input, combining adjacent rows. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves shifting the rows. For instance, in Example 0, the output rows 4 and 5 have 1s arranged in a pattern that might be from the lower part of the input. Let's check input row 13: after trimming, it's [1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but output row 4 starts with 0,1,1, etc. So maybe it's shifted left or right. Wait, the output row 4 starts with 0, then 1s. The input row 13's trimmed row starts with 1,1. So perhaps there's a shift, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero parts of the input and arranging them in a certain way. For example, the 4s at the beginning and end of the first output row correspond to the 4s in the input's first row. Then the 3s and 2s in the output correspond to the input's third and fourth rows. But how are they arranged?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a step-by-step transformation.\n\nStep 1: Trim each row by removing the first two and last elements. This reduces the column count by 3 (from 17 to 14 in Example 0, 18 to 14 in Example 1? Wait, in Example 1's input, each row has 18 elements. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first row has 18 elements. The output's first row has 7 elements. 18 - 3 =15? No, the output rows in Example 1 have 7 elements. Hmm, so maybe that idea is incorrect.\n\nWait, Example 1's output rows are of length 7. Let's check input row 1 in Example 1: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. If we remove the first two elements (0,0) and the last one (0), we get [4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which is 15 elements, but the output row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]. So that's 7 elements, not 15. So the previous approach of trimming first two and last one is incorrect. So maybe a different column transformation.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the examples. For Example 0, input rows are 17 elements, output is 14. 17-3=14. Example 1's input rows are 18 elements, output rows are 7 elements. 18-11=7. So that's inconsistent. So the trimming approach varies per example. That complicates things.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is generated by taking the non-zero elements from the input rows and surrounding them with zeros, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output rows:\n\nThe first output row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,4]. This matches the input rows 1 and 7, which have 4s at positions 2 and 8 (assuming 0-based indexing). But after trimming, perhaps the 4s are kept. But how does that lead to a row of 7 elements?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a central part of the input grid. For example, Example 0's input is 17x17, output is 9x14. The 9 rows could be the middle 9 rows, and 14 columns the middle 14 columns. Let's check:\n\nInput row length 17. Middle 14 columns would be columns 2 to 15 (0-based). So yes, trimming first two and last one. So columns are trimmed by removing the first two and last one. For rows, perhaps the middle 9 rows. For Example 0's input rows 0-16, the middle 9 rows would be rows 4 to 12 (inclusive). Let's check the output of Example 0. The first output row is [4,0,...4], which corresponds to input row 0. So that's not in the middle. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: The output rows are the input rows that have non-zero elements, after trimming. For example, in Example 0's input, rows 0,2,3,6,7,8,13,14, etc., but the output includes some of those. But this doesn't explain the exact pattern.\n\nAnother approach: Look for symmetry in the output. In Example 0's output, the first and last row are the same. Similarly, Example 1's output starts and ends with a row containing 4s. So maybe the output is symmetric. But how is that generated from the input?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a kind of reflection of the input. For example, combining rows from the top and bottom. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking certain layers or boundaries. For instance, the 4s in the first and last output rows of Example 0 are from the first and eighth input rows. But not sure.\n\nLet's look at the columns again. Example 0's output rows have 14 elements. Input rows have 17. Example 1's output rows have 7 elements, input rows have 18. 17-14=3, 18-7=11. That's a big difference. So maybe the column trimming is not consistent across examples. Therefore, the pattern must involve another transformation.\n\nAlternative idea: The output rows are formed by merging adjacent columns. For example, summing every two columns. Let's check Example 0:\n\nInput row 0 after trimming would be 14 columns. But output row 0 is 14 elements. So that can't be. So merging columns isn't the case.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output rows, each has 7 elements, and the input rows after trimming would have 15 elements (18-3=15). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the numbers in the output. In Example 0's output, the 4s are at the start and end of the first and last rows. The 3s and 2s are in the middle. Looking at the input, these numbers are present in certain positions, and the output seems to arrange them in a more compact form. Perhaps the output is a compressed version where consecutive identical numbers are merged. But the output rows don't seem to be run-length encoded.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a diamond-shaped pattern. For example, the 4s are at the corners, and other numbers form a diamond. But not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In the test input, the first and last rows have 4s at the start and end. So perhaps the output will retain those. The middle rows have 8s and 3s. Let's see how the training examples handle similar cases.\n\nIn Example 2's input, there are 2s, 1s, and 3s. The output combines them in certain ways, such as [0,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,0], which seems to merge the 2s and 1s from adjacent rows. So perhaps when there are adjacent blocks in different rows, they are merged in the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output might be combining horizontal and vertical blocks. For example, if two adjacent rows have overlapping non-zero regions, they are merged into a single row with the sum or maximum of the two.\n\nBut how to formalize this?\n\nIn Example 0's output, rows 4 and 5 are [0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]. Looking at the input rows 13,14,15, which have 1s arranged in a sort of cross. Maybe combining those rows into two rows that capture the horizontal and vertical parts.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a pattern in how the input rows are transformed into output rows.\n\nAnother observation: The output rows in Example 0 have the same number of rows as the number of distinct non-zero patterns in the input. For example, the two 3,3 rows become two rows in the output. The two 1,1 rows become two rows. The lower part's 1s are merged into two rows with more 1s.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are constructed by merging every two input rows into one output row. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's input has 17 rows. Output has 9. 17 rows would need to be paired, but 17 is odd. So perhaps the first row is kept, and then pairs are made. But 17 rows would become 1 + 8*2=17, which doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the same as the input rows, but with certain rows omitted. For example, in Example 0's input, rows 4,5,9,10, etc., which are all zeros, are omitted. But the output includes some zero rows. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the output as a kind of \"contour\" or outline of the input's non-zero regions. For example, taking the outer edges of the non-zero areas. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at Example 1's output, the first row has 4s at the start and end, which correspond to the input rows 1 and 7. The next two rows have 2s and 3s, which are from input rows 2-3 and 4-5. Then rows 4-5 of the output have 3s and 8s. The input rows 4-5 have 8s. Then the last row of the output is another 4s row. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the first occurrence of a non-zero row, then subsequent non-zero rows, but merging overlapping ones.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the result of some kind of cellular automaton step, where each output cell is derived from its neighbors in the input. For example, maybe each output cell is the sum of the surrounding cells in the input, but this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, the output is created by rotating or flipping the input. For example, a 90-degree rotation. But the input and output dimensions don't match. For Example 0, input is 17x17, output is 9x14. Rotating would swap rows and columns, but not the case here.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compare the input and output of each example more carefully.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput rows (selected):\n\nRow 0: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0] \u2192 Output row 0: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0] \u2192 Output row 2: [0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 Output row 4: [0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nWait, input row 6 and 7 have 1s in the middle. Output rows 4 and 5 have more 1s. How are they generated? Maybe combining multiple input rows. For example, input rows 6 and 7 have 1s in positions 7-8. Then, maybe the output's rows 4 and 5 are combining these with rows 13-14 which also have 1s. For example, input row 13 has 1s in positions 2-3 and 5-6. After trimming, these might become positions 0-1 and 3-4. Then, combining with rows 6-7's 1s (positions 7-8) to form a wider spread.\n\nThis seems like the output is a combination of multiple input rows, possibly overlapping them. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are the result of summing all input rows (after trimming), but that would result in a single row. Not the case.\n\nPerhaps the output is a specific layer of the input, such as the maximum values from each column across certain rows. For example, output row 4 in Example 0 has 1s spread out, which could be the maximum of multiple rows' 1s. But how to determine which rows.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should focus on the column trimming first, then row trimming, then look for merging of adjacent rows.\n\nFor the test input, each row has 18 elements. Let's see. The output rows would need to have a certain length. Looking at the training examples:\n\nExample 1's input rows are 18 elements, output rows are 7 elements. So perhaps the column trimming is removing the first 6 and last 5 elements, but that's 18-11=7. Let's check:\n\nTest input's first row: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]. If we remove first 6 and last 5 elements, we take elements 6 to 12 (inclusive), which is 7 elements. Let's see:\n\nOriginal elements 6-12 (indices 6-12): 0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So the output row would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the first row of the test input has 4 at the start and end. But according to Example 1's column trimming, the 4s are retained. So this approach might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are being divided into chunks. For example, in Example 1's input rows of 18 elements, the output rows have 7 elements. 18/7 is roughly 2.57. Not sure.\n\nAlternative idea: The output rows are formed by taking every other element after trimming. For Example 0, 17 elements trimmed to 14. Taking every other element would give 7 elements. But 14/2=7. So that fits Example 1's output rows (7 elements). Example 0's output rows are 14 elements, so that wouldn't work. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the numbers in the output:\n\nIn Example 0's output row 4: [0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]. The 1s are in two groups. This could be a combination of input rows 6,7 (which have 1s) and rows 13,14 (which have 1s). Maybe the output rows are merging these into a single pattern. So the output is a combination of different parts of the input, vertically.\n\nPerhaps the output is constructed by taking certain rows from the input and arranging them in a way that combines their non-zero elements, with some overlap. For example, the 1s from different rows are combined into a single row in the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a horizontal concatenation of certain vertical sections of the input. For example, the left and right parts of the input are combined.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nThe input has 19 rows (0-18). The output will likely have fewer rows, perhaps around 10. The columns will be trimmed. Looking at the training examples, the test input's rows have 18 elements. Example 1's input also has 18-element rows and output has 7-element rows, so perhaps the same column trimming applies: removing the first 6 and last 5 elements to get 7 elements. Let's check:\n\nTest input first row: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nIf we remove first 6 and last 5 elements: elements 6-12 (indices 6 to 12 inclusive), which are [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the first output row would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but this doesn't capture the 4s. Hmm, this can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the column trimming varies per example. For example, in Example 0, columns are trimmed by removing first two and last one. In Example 1, columns are trimmed by removing first 8 and last 3, resulting in 7 elements. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the column trimming is such that for each row, the first and last occurrence of a non-zero element determine the kept columns. For example, for each row, find the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements and keep those columns plus a certain margin. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the output columns are the middle section of the input columns. For Example 0, 17 columns: the middle 14. For Example 1, 18 columns: the middle 7. But how?\n\nGiven the time I've spent without a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. The test input's rows have 4s at the start and end. The middle rows have 8s and 3s. The output rows will likely have the 4s at the start and end, and the 8s and 3s merged into blocks. Perhaps the output rows are formed by trimming the columns and then merging adjacent rows that have non-zero elements.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows 2-5 (which have 8s and 3s), after trimming columns, these may form a block. Similarly, the lower rows have 8 and 3 and 1s. The output will likely have these merged into contiguous blocks.\n\nGiven the examples, especially Example 2 where input rows with 2s and 1s are merged into output rows with both, I think the output is formed by combining adjacent rows and columns, keeping the non-zero values. \n\nFor the test input, after trimming columns (possibly removing first two and last one), the rows with 8s and 3s would form four consecutive rows in the input. The output may merge these into two rows, each duplicated. Similarly, the lower rows with 8, 3, and 1s may be merged into a single row.\n\nBut without a precise pattern, this is guesswork. The safest approach is to mimic the examples' structure. For example, the output will start and end with rows having 4s at the ends. The middle rows will have blocks of 8s and 3s. The lower rows may have merged 1s and 3s.\n\nSo, applying this to the test input:\n\nThe first row of the test input is [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]. Trimming columns by removing first two and last one gives [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But the output should start and end with 4s, so perhaps this trimming is not the case. Alternatively, the 4s are retained by trimming differently. For example, removing only the first two and last one columns may retain the 4s. Let's see:\n\nOriginal first row: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]. Removing first two columns (4 and 0) gives [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]. Then removing the last one (4) gives [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. That removes the 4s, which is not desired. So maybe the trimming isn't applied here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are at positions that, after trimming, remain. For example, if trimming columns by removing the first 8 and last 8 columns, but that would leave 2 columns, which doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Given the time, I'll proceed with an assumption based on the training examples and generate an output that mirrors their structure, especially the placement of the 4s and the merging of similar blocks.",
