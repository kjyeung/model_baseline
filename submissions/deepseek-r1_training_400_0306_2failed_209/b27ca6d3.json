        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output ones in the training examples, and then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input has a bunch of 0s and some 2s. The output introduces 3s around some of the 2s. Let me see where the 3s are placed. \n\nIn the output of Example 0, the 3s form a sort of diamond or cross shape around the 2s. For instance, in the third row (index 2), there's a 2 at position 2. In the output, around that 2, there are 3s in positions 6, 7, 8 (same row) and in the rows above and below. Wait, maybe it's a Moore neighborhood? Like checking all eight surrounding cells. But the 3s here seem to be in a specific pattern. Let me check another 2. For example, in row 4 (index 4) of the input, there's a 2 at column 13. The output has 3s around it in a cross shape. Hmm. Maybe the 3s are placed in the cells adjacent (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) to the 2s, but only if those cells are 0 in the input. Because in the output, the 3s replace 0s that are next to 2s. But wait, in the first example, the 3s form a 3x3 square around some 2s. Like, for a 2, the surrounding cells become 3s. But maybe it's not all adjacent cells. Let me check the output again.\n\nTake the input row 2 in Example 0: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output row 2 becomes [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, ...]. So the 2 at position 2 (third column) has a 3 to the right (position 6) and left (position 6? Wait, maybe the 3s are in a cross shape around each 2. Wait, looking at the output, around each 2, there are 3s in a plus shape (up, down, left, right) and diagonals? Or maybe a diamond pattern. Alternatively, maybe the 3s are placed in cells that are one step away from the 2 in all directions. Let me count the positions. For the 2 in row 2, column 2 (0-based index?), the output has 3s in row 1, columns 6,7,8? Wait, maybe the 3s form a diamond pattern around each 2. Alternatively, it's a 3x3 square centered on the 2, replacing all 0s with 3s except the center (which is the 2). Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 1's input, there's a 2 in row 0, column 8 and 9. The output in row 0 has 3s around them. For example, in row 0, columns 7 becomes 3, 8 and 9 are 2s, then 10 becomes 3. So maybe the 3s are in the neighboring cells of each 2. So for each 2 in the input, all adjacent cells (including diagonally adjacent) that are 0 in the input are replaced with 3. Wait, but in Example 0's output, some cells that were 0 in the input are now 3, but perhaps overlapping when two 2s are close. Let me confirm.\n\nAnother angle: in the output, wherever a 3 appears, it's adjacent to a 2. So the transformation is to place 3s in all cells adjacent (including diagonally) to any 2, but only if those cells were 0 in the input. So for each cell in the input that is 0, if it has any neighboring 2 (within the 8 surrounding cells), then it becomes 3. But looking at Example 0's output, for the 2 in row 2, column 2 (0-based?), the cells around it in the output are 3s. Let's see. The original input's row 2 has a 2 at column 2. The output row 1 (the row above) has columns 6,7,8 as 3,3,3. Wait, that's a bit far. Wait, maybe the 3s are not adjacent. Hmm, maybe I need to look again. Wait, perhaps the 3s are placed in a cross shape, but with a distance. Alternatively, maybe the 3s are placed in a diamond pattern of radius 2. Let me check the positions.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the first row that has 3s is row 1 (second row if starting from 0), columns 6,7,8. The 2 in row 2 (third row) is at column 2 and 7. Wait, maybe the 3s are in a plus shape around the 2, but three cells in each direction. For example, the 2 in row 2, column 2: the output has 3s in row 1, columns 6,7,8. That's three cells to the right. Wait, that doesn't align. Maybe the 3s are placed in a certain pattern not directly adjacent. Alternatively, perhaps the 3s are placed in a diamond shape of radius 3. This is getting confusing. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first row has a 2 in column 8 and 9. The output row 0 has 3s starting at column 7 and 10. So maybe the 3s are placed in a cross around the 2s. Alternatively, maybe for each 2, the cells that are two steps away in each direction (up, down, left, right) become 3. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Moore neighborhood with a certain radius. Wait, maybe the 3s are placed in all cells that are in a 3x3 square centered on each 2, but only replacing 0s. Let's check. For example, in Example 0, row 2, column 2 (the 2), the 3x3 square around it would be from row 1-3, column 1-3. But in the output, row 1 has 3s starting at column 6,7,8. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternative approach: compare input and output for each example. Let's take Example 0:\n\nInput row 2 has a 2 at position 2 and 7. In the output, around these 2s, there are 3s. For the 2 at position 7 in row 2 (third row), the output row 1 has 3s at columns 6,7,8. Similarly, row 2's 7th column has 3s above and below. So maybe for each 2, the three cells to the left, the three cells to the right, and the three cells above and below form a cross? Like, a horizontal line of three 3s centered on the 2 and a vertical line of three 3s centered on the 2. So each 2 creates a cross of 3s, three cells in each direction (left, right, up, down), but not diagonally. Let me check.\n\nFor the 2 at row 2, column 7 in Example 0's input, the output has in row 1, columns 6,7,8 (3s), row 2's columns 6 and 8 (since the 2 is at 7, so left and right), and row 3's columns 6,7,8. So that's a cross: three cells above, three below, and left and right of the 2. That would make a plus shape with arms of length 3. Wait, but in that case, the cross would be 3 cells in each direction. But the 2 is at column 7. So columns 6,7,8 are the horizontal part. The rows above (row 1) and below (row 3) have 3s in columns 6,7,8. So that's a cross of 3x3. So for each 2, the output places 3s in a 3x3 square centered on the 2. But wait, the center cell is the 2 itself, so the surrounding 8 cells would be 3s. But in the example, it's a 3x3 square. Wait, for example, in row 2, column 7 (the 2), the 3x3 square would cover rows 1-3, columns 6-8. Looking at the output:\n\nRow 1: columns 6,7,8 \u2192 3s.\n\nRow 2: columns 6 and 8 (since 7 is the 2).\n\nRow 3: columns 6,7,8 \u2192 3s.\n\nSo yes, the 3x3 square around the 2 is filled with 3s, except the center which remains 2. But in this case, the original input's cells in that 3x3 square were 0s, so they become 3s. But if a cell is already a 2, it's left as is. For example, in row 2, column 7 is 2, and in row 3, column 7 of the input is 2. Wait, looking at Example 0's input row 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, ...]. So in row 3, column 7 is a 2. So in the output, when placing the 3x3 square around row 2, column 7's 2, the cell at row 3, column 7 is already a 2 (from the input), so it remains 2 instead of being replaced by 3. So the rule seems to be: for every cell that is a 2 in the input, replace all adjacent cells (including diagonally) within a 3x3 square (excluding the center) with 3, but only if they are 0 in the input. If they are already 2, they stay as 2.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each 2 in the input, turn all surrounding 8 cells into 3s if they are 0. But wait, in the example, the 3x3 square includes cells beyond immediate adjacency. Wait, maybe it's a Moore neighborhood of radius 1 (i.e., all cells around the 2 within one step). Let me confirm.\n\nIn Example 0's output row 4, there's a 2 at column 13. The output has 3s around it. Looking at the input row 4: the 2 is at column 13. The output row 4 has 3s in columns 6,7,8? Wait, no. Let me check the input and output again for Example 0.\n\nWait, input row 4 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Output row 4 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Wait, that's in columns 6,7,8. But the 2 is at column 13. Hmm, that's confusing. So the 2 is at column 13, but the 3s are in columns 6-8. That's a big distance. So my previous assumption must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the indexes. Let me check again. The input for Example 0 is:\n\nRow 2 (third row) input: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo the two 2s are at positions 2 and 7 (columns 3 and 8 if 1-based, but assuming 0-based, columns 2 and 7). The output row 2 is [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 3, 0, ...]. So around the 2 at column 7, the 3s are in column 6 and 8 (left and right) and the rows above and below have 3s in columns 6,7,8. So for that 2, the 3s form a cross shape. So rows 1, 2, and 3 (relative to the 2's row) and columns 6,7,8. Wait, maybe it's a vertical line of three cells (the same column) and a horizontal line of three cells (same row), forming a plus sign. So for each 2, the output adds 3s in the cells directly above, same, and below (vertical line of 3 cells) and left, same, right (horizontal line of 3 cells). But the same cell (the 2) remains 2. So the total is 3 vertical and 3 horizontal, overlapping at the center. So that's a cross of 3x3 cells. For example, the 2 at (row, column) = (2,7). Then, the output has:\n\n- row 1, columns 6,7,8: 3s\n\n- row 2, columns 6,7,8: but column 7 is the 2, so 3,2,3\n\n- row 3, columns 6,7,8: 3s\n\nSo that's a cross of 3x3. So the pattern is that for every 2 in the input, create a cross of 3x3 cells (vertical and horizontal) centered on the 2, turning all 0s into 3s. If there's overlap between crosses from different 2s, the 3s remain. Existing 2s are left as is.\n\nLet's check Example 1. For instance, in the input row 0, columns 8 and 9 are 2s. The output row 0 has 3s at columns 7, 8,9,10 (but columns 8 and 9 are 2s, so 3s are 7 and 10, but looking at the output: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,2,3,0,3,2,3,0]. So columns 7,10,13,14 become 3s. Wait, maybe this approach isn't working. Let's see. The input row 0 has 2s at 8 and 9. The output has 3s at 7 and 10 (left and right), but also at 13 and 14. Hmm, maybe there's another 2 influencing that. For example, the input row 0 has a 2 at column 13. Wait, no, input row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,2,0,0]. So columns 8,9,13 are 2s. So each of these 2s would create their own crosses. The 2 at column 8 would create a cross covering columns 7,8,9 and rows -1 (if possible?), but since it's the first row, maybe only the rows below. But the output for row 0, columns 7,8,9,10: 3 at 7, 2 at 8 and 9, 3 at 10. So that's the horizontal part of the cross (columns 7-10) for the 2s at 8 and 9. The vertical part would be rows -1 (which doesn't exist), row 0, and row 1. So row 0's vertical part is handled. For the 2 at column 13 in row 0, the cross would be columns 12,13,14 and rows -1,0,1. So in row 0, columns 12,13,14 would be 3s. The output for row 0's column 13 is 2 (original input), so the cross for that 2 would have 3s at 12 and 14. But in the output, row 0 has 3s at 13 (which is the 2) and 14? Wait, no. The output row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,2,3,0,3,2,3,0]. So column 12 is 3 (maybe due to the 2 at column 13?), column 13 is 2, column 14 is 3. That fits the cross: columns 12,13,14 (with 13 being 2) and rows 0 (since it's the same row) and rows -1 and 1. But row 1's column 13 would have 3s. \n\nSo the pattern is: for each 2 in the input, set a cross (horizontal and vertical) of three cells centered on the 2, replacing 0s with 3s. The cross spans three cells in each direction (left, right, up, down) from the 2, but within the bounds of the matrix. Any existing 2s in those positions remain. So overlapping crosses from multiple 2s will combine their 3s.\n\nSo the transformation steps would be:\n\n1. For each cell in the input matrix:\n   a. If the cell is a 2, then in the output matrix, leave it as 2.\n   b. Otherwise, check all cells in the input that are in a cross (3x3 cross centered on any 2). If the cell is part of any such cross and was 0 in the input, it becomes 3. Otherwise, it remains 0.\n\nAlternatively, for each 2 in the input, create a cross of 3s around it, overwriting 0s but leaving existing 2s.\n\nNow, applying this pattern to the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input, which is a 17-row matrix. Each 2 in the input should generate a cross of 3s around it. Let's identify all 2s in the test input and then mark the 3s accordingly.\n\nLet's list the positions of all 2s in the test input:\n\nRow 0: column 15 (value 2)\nRow 1: column 4\nRow 3: columns 13 and 15\nRow 4: columns 8 and 9\nRow 5: column 12\nRow 7: columns 2 and 3\nRow 8: column 14\nRow 9: columns 6 and 14\nRow 10: columns 0 and 7\nRow 11: columns 9 and 11\nRow 12: columns 2 and 4\nRow 13: columns 1,6,7,11,13\nRow 14: column 3 and 15\nRow 15: column 7\nRow 16: column 8\n\nNow, for each of these 2s, we need to mark a cross (3 cells left-right and 3 cells up-down) around them, converting 0s to 3s. Note that if a cell is part of multiple crosses (e.g., near two 2s), it remains 3.\n\nLet's go through each row of the test input and apply this transformation.\n\nFor example, starting with row 0, column 15 (the 2). The cross would cover:\n\n- Columns 14,15,16 (but row 0 has 16 columns, so 14 and 15 are valid; 16 is beyond, so only 14 and 15. Wait, original test input rows are of varying lengths. Wait, looking back, the test input rows:\n\nRow 0: 16 elements (0-based columns 0-15)\nRow 1: 16 elements\nRow 2: 16 elements\n... up to row 16: 16 elements.\n\nSo each row has 16 columns (indices 0-15). So for a 2 at column 15 in row 0:\n\nThe horizontal cross would be columns 14,15,16. But since columns go up to 15, columns 14 and 15. The vertical cross would be rows -1 (invalid), 0, and 1. So the vertical part is rows 0 and 1. So for each cell in this cross, if it's 0 in the input, it becomes 3.\n\nSo for row 0, column 15:\n\n- Horizontal: columns 14,15 \u2192 in row 0, columns 14 and 15. But column 15 is the 2, so only column 14 (0-based) becomes 3 if it was 0.\n\n- Vertical: rows 0 and 1, column 15. So row 0's column 15 is 2, row 1's column 15 is 0 (input row 1: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]). So row 1, column 15 was 0, becomes 3.\n\nSimilarly, for each 2, we need to mark their cross.\n\nThis is quite tedious, but let's try to process a few examples.\n\nAnother example: row 1, column 4 (2). The cross is:\n\nHorizontal: columns 3,4,5.\n\nVertical: rows 0,1,2, column 4.\n\nFor each of these cells, if they are 0 in the input, they become 3.\n\nSo in row 0, column 3,4,5: original input row 0 has 0s. So they become 3s.\n\nRow 1, columns 3,4,5: column 4 is 2, others are 0 \u2192 3s at 3 and 5.\n\nRow 2, columns 3,4,5: all 0s \u2192 become 3s.\n\nVertical part: rows 0,1,2, column 4. So row 0, column 4 becomes 3. Row 1, column 4 is 2. Row 2, column 4 becomes 3.\n\nSo combining, for this 2, the cross affects several cells.\n\nSimilarly, all other 2s need to be processed similarly.\n\nThe final output will have 3s in all the cells that are in the cross of any 2, and 2s remain where they were. All other cells remain 0.\n\nNow, applying this to the entire test input. Since manually doing all 17 rows is time-consuming, but the pattern is clear: for each 2, draw a cross of 3 cells in each direction (horizontal and vertical), replace 0s with 3s.\n\nThe answer will be the test input matrix with 3s added in the crosses around each 2.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists. Let's look at the training examples first.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has several rows with 0s and some 2s. The output adds 3s around some of the 2s. For instance, in the third row of the input, there's a 2 at position 2 and 7. In the output, around those positions, there are 3s forming a sort of cross or plus shape. Wait, looking closer: the row [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,...] becomes [0,0,2,0,0,0,3,2,3,...]. So around each 2, the adjacent cells (left, right, above, below?) become 3s? But in the same row, the 2 at position 7 (index 7 maybe) has 3s on either side. Also, the rows above and below have 3s in the same column. So maybe whenever there's a 2, the cells adjacent (up, down, left, right) become 3, but only if they are 0 in the input. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2s are in row 2 (third row) columns 2 and 7. In the output, around those positions, the cells to the left and right (if possible) and above and below get 3s. For example, the 2 in row 2, column 2: the row above (row 1) has 3s in columns 6,7,8. Wait, no. Wait in Example 0's output, the second row (index 1) is [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0...]. That's three 3s in columns 6,7,8. The original 2 is in row 2, column 7 (since index starts at 0?), so the row above (row 1) has 3s around column 7. Hmm maybe the 3s form a 3x3 square around each 2, except the center which is the 2. But wait, in the output for row 2, the 2 is at position 2 (original input) and in the output, the surrounding cells (left and right in the same row, and the rows above and below have 3s in the same column and adjacent columns). Wait maybe each 2 is surrounded by a cross of 3s, but not a square. For instance, for a 2 at (x,y), the cells (x-1,y), (x+1,y), (x,y-1), (x,y+1) become 3, but maybe also the diagonals? Or maybe a 3x3 block with the center being the 2 and the surrounding 8 cells turned to 3, but in the output examples, sometimes there's a cross.\n\nWait looking at Example 0's output, in row 1 (second row of output), columns 6,7,8 are 3s. The original 2s in row 2 and 3 (third and fourth rows) are in column 7. So for the 2 in row 2, column 7, the row above (row 1) has 3s in columns 6,7,8. Then, row 2's output has a 2 at column 7, and 3s on either side (columns 6 and 8). Row 3's output has 3s in columns 6,7,8. So that forms a cross? So maybe each 2 is surrounded by 3s in all eight neighboring cells, but only if those cells are 0 in the input. Wait, but in Example 0's input, the 2 in row 2 (third row) column 2. Let's see its output. The output row for that row is [0,0,2,0,0,0,3,2,3,0...]. So in the same row, the cells to the left and right of the 2 (columns 1 and 3?) Wait, no. Wait the 2 is at column 2 (third element), so in the output, columns 6 and 8 are 3s? Wait no, that seems inconsistent. Maybe I'm getting confused with the indices. Let's take the input and output of Example 0's third row (index 2):\n\nInput row 2: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput row 2: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo the 2 is at position 2 (third element). The output has 3 at positions 6 and 8. Wait, that's not adjacent. Hmm, maybe the pattern isn't directly adjacent. Wait, perhaps the 3s are placed in a diamond shape around each 2. Let me check the other 2s.\n\nAnother 2 is in input row 4 (index 4) column 13. The output row 4 has [..., 3,3,3, ...] around the 2. Wait the output row 4 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. So here, the 2 is in column 13. The 3s are in columns 6,7,8. That doesn't align. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the indices here. Maybe the 3s are not directly around the 2s. Alternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a cross (horizontal and vertical) of 3s around each 2, extending three cells in each direction. For example, in Example 0's output row 1, columns 6,7,8 are 3s. The 2 in row 2, column 7 (original input) has 3s in the row above (row 1) columns 6-8, same row columns 6 and 8, and row 3 columns 6-8. That forms a cross. Wait, maybe each 2 is the center of a plus sign of 3s, three cells in each direction. But in Example 0's row 2, the 2 at column 2 has in the same row 3s at columns 6 and 8? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to look at the positions more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are placed in a 3x3 square around each 2. For example, for each 2 in the input, the surrounding 8 cells (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) are set to 3. But in Example 0's output, the 2 at row 2, column 2 (0-based index 2) would have 3s in row 1 columns 1-3, row 2 columns 1 and 3, and row 3 columns 1-3. But in the output, row 2 has a 2 at column 2, and row 1 has 3s starting at column 6. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe the 3s are not around the 2s, but maybe the 3s form a pattern based on some other rule. Let's look at Example 1. The input has a row [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,2,0,0], and the output is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,2,3,0,3,2,3,0]. So around the 2s in columns 8 and 9 (the two 2s), the output has 3s in column 7, 10, 13, etc. Wait, the first 2 in column 8 (input) has a 3 in column 7 (before) and 10 (after), and the 2 in column 13 has a 3 before and after. So maybe for each consecutive 2, the adjacent 0s are turned into 3s. But the 3s are placed in the neighboring cells. For example, each 2 in the input is surrounded by 3s on left, right, top, and bottom.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a cellular automaton where 2s spread 3s in their neighborhood. Let's think of each 2 as a source, and any 0 cell adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a 2 becomes 3. But in Example 0's output, the 2 in row 2, column 2 (input) has 3s in row 1, columns 6-8, which doesn't align. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output. Let's take a specific row. For instance, in Example 1's input row 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,2,0,0]. The output row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,2,3,0,3,2,3,0]. So the 2s are at positions 8,9,13. The output adds 3s before and after each 2. So between the two 2s (positions 8 and 9), there's no 3. But after position 9, there's a 3 at 10. Before position 8 (position 7) there's a 3. Similarly, around the 2 at 13, there's a 3 before (12) and after (14). So maybe each 2 in the input causes the cells immediately to the left and right (if 0) to become 3. But in the same row, the 2 at 8 (input) has a 3 to the left (7) and the 2 at 9 has a 3 to the right (10). So adjacent left and right of each 2 becomes 3.\n\nBut also, in the output row 1 of Example 1, the input row 1 is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. The output is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,3,2,3,0]. The 2 is at position 0. In the output, the cells to the right (position 1?) are 0, so maybe that's not part of it. Wait, maybe the 3s are added not just left and right but also above and below. Let's check.\n\nLooking at the input and output of Example 1's row 0 and row 1. The input row 0 has 2s at 8,9,13. The output row 0 has 3s at 7,10,12,14. So for each 2, left and right get 3s. Then, in row 1, the output has 3s starting at position 7. The input row 1 has a 2 at position 0 (the first element) and at 13. The output row 1 has 3s from 7 to 10 (positions 7-10), which seems unrelated to the 2s in that row. Maybe this is due to 2s in adjacent rows. For example, the 2s in row 0's positions 8,9,13 could cause 3s in the cells below them (row 1's 8,9,13). But row 1's output has 3s in positions 7-10. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the 3s are added in a diamond pattern around each 2. For example, for each 2, the cells to the left, right, above, below, and diagonals are set to 3, but only if they are 0. But looking at the outputs, this might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a convolution where each 2 creates a 3x3 area around it. For instance, each 2 in the input causes the surrounding cells in a 3x3 square (including diagonals) to become 3s, unless there's already a 2. But in Example 0's output, the 2 at row 2, column 7 has 3s in row 1, columns 6-8; row 2, columns 6 and 8; and row 3, columns 6-8. That's a 3x3 cross. Wait, that's a cross shape of 3s around each 2. So for each 2, the cells in the same column (above and below) and the same row (left and right) are set to 3, forming a cross. But how far does this cross extend?\n\nIn Example 0's output row 2, the 2 at column 2 has 3s in the same row at columns 6 and 8. That's four positions away. That seems too far. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let's look at the input row 2: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,...]. The output row 2 is [0,0,2,0,0,0,3,2,3,0,...]. So the 2 is at index 2. The 3s are at index 6 and 8. Wait, that's four elements to the right. That's a distance of 4. That doesn't fit a cross pattern. Maybe this is a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are placed in a certain pattern that's not directly adjacent. Let me think of another angle. Perhaps the transformation adds 3s in the positions that are the sum of the indices where 2s are present. But that seems unclear. \n\nWait, maybe the 3s are added in a certain direction from each 2. For example, each 2 generates 3s to the left, right, up, down, but only for a certain number of steps. Like, three steps in each direction. But in Example 0's output row 1 (second row), the 3s are in columns 6,7,8. If the 2 in row 2, column 7 is the source, then in row 1 (above), columns 6,7,8 are 3s. That's a horizontal line of three 3s. Similarly, in row 2, the 3s are at 6 and 8 (left and right of the 2 at 7). And row 3 also has 3s at 6,7,8. So this forms a cross that's three cells in each direction. So each 2 creates a cross of 3s that is three cells in each direction (left, right, up, down). Let's check:\n\nFor the 2 in row 2, column 7:\n\n- Up: row 1, columns 6,7,8 \u2192 three 3s\n- Same row: columns 6 and 8 \u2192 two 3s (left and right)\n- Down: row 3, columns 6,7,8 \u2192 three 3s\nSo total 3+2+3=8 3s forming a cross. That seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's output row 0, the 2 at column 8 has 3s in columns 7 (left) and 10 (right) but also above and below. Wait, no. Looking at Example 1's output row 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,2,3,0,3,2,3,0]. The 2s are at 8,9. The 3s are at 7,10,12,14. The 3s at 7 and 10 could be left and right of the 2s at 8 and 9. But the 3s at 12 and 14 are around the 2 at 13. So for each 2, the left and right cells become 3, and the cells above and below (in the same column) become 3s three cells away? That doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe each 2 creates a cross of 3s in all four directions (up, down, left, right) but extending for a certain distance. Maybe three cells in each direction. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's input row 0, the 2 at column 8 would create 3s to the left (7), and to the right (9 is a 2, so maybe next is 10). Then, above and below. But since row 0 is the top, there's no row above. Below (row 1) at column 8 would be 3. Looking at row 1's output, column 8 is 3. So that fits. Similarly, the 2 at column 13 in row 0 would create 3s left (12), right (14), and below (row 1, column 13). In row 1's output, column 13 is 3. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each 2 in the input, set the cells to the left, right, above, and below (each direction) to 3, up to three cells away. Wait, but in Example 0, the cross extends three cells in each direction. For example, the 2 in row 2, column 7 (input) has 3s in row 1 (above), columns 6,7,8 (three cells), and row 3 (below), same columns. Also, same row, columns 6 and 8 (left and right). So it's a cross of three cells in each direction. \n\nSo the rule might be: for each 2 in the input, in the output, replace all 0s in the cross-shaped area around it (three cells up, three down, three left, three right, and the same for other directions) with 3s, but overlapping areas might overwrite. But how far? Let's see:\n\nIf the cross is three cells in each direction, then for each 2 at (x,y), the cells (x-3,y) to (x+3,y) horizontally and (x,y-3) to (x,y+3) vertically are set to 3, but only if they are within the bounds and originally 0. Wait, but in Example 0, the 2 at row 2, column 2 (third row, third column) would have a cross extending three cells in each direction. But the output for row 2, column 2's neighboring cells are 0,0,2,0,0, etc. So perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross is three cells in total, so left by one, same, right by one, up by one, same, down by one. Wait, but that would form a plus sign of 3s. For example, each 2 would have 3s in the cells immediately adjacent (up, down, left, right). Let's check Example 0 again. The 2 in row 2, column 7. If the adjacent cells (left, right, up, down) become 3, then in row 1, column 7 would be 3; row 3, column 7 would be 3; row 2, columns 6 and 8 would be 3. But in the output, row 2's columns 6 and 8 are 3, row 1's columns 6,7,8 are 3, and row 3's columns 6,7,8 are 3. So that's more than just adjacent cells. So perhaps the cross is three cells in length, meaning three cells in each direction. For example, left by three, right by three, etc. But that seems variable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s form a diamond shape around each 2. For example, Manhattan distance of 1 or 2. But this is getting confusing. \n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output for each 2 and see which cells turn to 3. Let's take Example 0's first 2 in row 2, column 2. The output for this row has 3s at columns 6 and 8. Wait, that's quite far. Maybe the distance isn't the same. Alternatively, perhaps the 3s are added in the same positions relative to the 2's position but scaled somehow. For example, mirroring? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are added in positions that are a certain multiple away. For example, the 2's column index multiplied by 3. But that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each 2 in the input creates a vertical line of three 3s above and below, and a horizontal line of three 3s to the left and right. For example, the 2 in row 2, column 7 in Example 0 creates a horizontal line in its row (columns 6,7,8) but the output shows 3,2,3. Wait, no, in row 2, the 2 is at column 7, and the output has 3 at 6 and 8. So that's two 3s horizontally. Then above (row 1), columns 6,7,8 are 3s. Below (row 3), columns 6,7,8 are 3s. So vertical lines of three 3s. And horizontally, the immediate left and right cells. So the pattern is for each 2, create a vertical line of three 3s centered on the 2's column, spanning three rows (above and below), and a horizontal line of three 3s centered on the 2's row, spanning three columns (left and right). But in row 2, the horizontal line is only two 3s (left and right of the 2). Wait, maybe the horizontal line is three cells including the 2. But the 2 remains, so it's the cell itself, but since it's a 2, the 3s are only on the left and right. \n\nThis is getting complex. Let's try to formalize:\n\nFor each 2 in the input at position (row, col):\n\n- In the same row, set the cells at col-1, col+1 to 3 (if within bounds and 0).\n- In the same column, set the cells at row-1, row, row+1 to 3 in the columns col-1, col, col+1 (forming a vertical cross). \n\nWait, no. Let's see the output of Example 0's 2 at row 2, col 7:\n\nOutput row 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0...]\nRow 2: [0,0,2,0,0,0,3,2,3,0...]\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0...]\n\nSo around the 2 at row 2, col 7, there's a 3x3 square in rows 1-3 and cols 6-8, except the center (row 2, col 7) which is the 2. So the 3s form a square around the 2, with the 2 in the center. That's a 3x3 grid of 3s surrounding each 2. But in the input, there's another 2 in row 3, col 7. Its 3x3 square would overlap with the first 2's, leading to merged 3s. \n\nIn Example 0, the input has two 2s in row 2 and 3, both at column 7. The output for rows 1-4, columns 6-8 show 3s. This would fit the 3x3 squares around each 2. \n\nSimilarly, the 2 in row 4, column 13: the output has 3s in row 4, columns 6-8, but wait, no. Wait row 4's output is [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. The 2 is at column 13. The 3s are at columns 6-8. That doesn't make sense. Unless there's another 2 nearby. So this contradicts the initial hypothesis. \n\nWait maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at Example 0's input row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. The output row 4 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. So the 2 is at column 13 (0-based), and the 3s are at columns 6-8. That's a long way from the 2. So this can't be part of the 3x3 square around the 2. So this suggests that the previous hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nHmm. Now I'm really confused. Let's think of another angle. Maybe the 3s are not related to the 2s in the same input. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at the inputs and outputs again.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first non-zero row is row 2: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0...]. The output for that row is [0,0,2,0,0,0,3,2,3,0...]. The 3s are at positions 6 and 8. The 2s are at 2 and 7. So for the 2 at position 2, the 3s are at 6 and 8? That's four positions to the right. That's a big jump. Maybe there's a numerical pattern here. For example, the position of the 3s is determined by some calculation based on the position of the 2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are added in a way that each 2 creates a specific shape, like a diamond or a square, but with a certain size. But how to determine where the 3s are placed. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the 3s are placed at positions that are the sum of the indices of the 2s. For example, in Example 0's row 2, the 2s are at columns 2 and 7. The 3s in that row are at 6 and 8. 2+7=9, but 6+8=14. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are placed at positions that are mirror images of the 2s. For example, the 2 at column 2 in a row of length 18 would have a mirror at column 15 (18-2-1=15?), but in Example 0's output row 2, there are 3s at 6 and 8, which are not mirrors. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are placed in a pattern that's the same across all examples. For instance, in Example 1's input row 0, the output has 3s at positions 7,10,12,14. The 2s are at 8,9,13. So for each 2, the 3 is to the left and right. For the 2 at 8: left (7) and right (9 is another 2, so perhaps right of 9 is 10. Similarly, for the 2 at 13: left (12) and right (14). That fits. So perhaps for each 2 in the input, the adjacent left and right cells (if 0) are turned into 3s. But also, for each 2, the cells in the row above and below, same column, and adjacent columns are turned into 3s. \n\nFor example, in Example 1's input row 0, the 2s at 8 and 9 (adjacent) lead to 3s at 7 (left of 8), 10 (right of 9), and in the row above (none, since it's the top row) and row below (row 1). In row 1's output, columns 7-10 are 3s. So maybe for each 2, we add a horizontal 3 on the left and right, and a vertical 3 in the column above and below, possibly spanning three cells. \n\nThis is getting too vague. Let's try to think of the transformation as adding 3s in a cross shape around each 2. The cross includes the cells to the left, right, above, and below, and possibly extending for a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, think of it as a cellular automaton where 2s spread 3s in all four directions (left, right, up, down) by a certain number of steps. Maybe each 2 generates 3s in all four directions until a non-zero cell is encountered. \n\nFor instance, in Example 0's row 2, the 2 at column 2. To the right, it would generate 3s until it hits the 2 at column 7. But in the output, there's a 3 at column 6 and 8. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe each 2 generates 3s in all directions up to a distance of 3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 3s corresponds to the number of 2s in adjacent rows. \n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output of both examples to find common transformations. \n\nIn both examples, the output introduces 3s in positions that are adjacent to 2s. For example, in Example 1's input row 0, the 2s are at 8,9,13. The output adds 3s at 7,10,12,14. So left of the first 2, right of the second 2, left of the third 2, and right of the third 2. So each 2 adds 3s to the left and right. Additionally, in the row below (row 1), columns 7-10 have 3s, which could be below the 2s in row 0. So maybe each 2 adds 3s to the left, right, and the three cells below (same columns and adjacent). \n\nWait, in Example 1's output row 1, the 3s are at 7-10. The 2s in row 0 are at 8,9,13. So columns 7-10 are below columns 7-10 of row 0. The 2s in row 0 are at 8,9,13. So perhaps below each 2 in row 0 (columns 8,9,13), in row 1, columns 7-10 and 12-14 are set to 3s. But that's not exactly matching. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each 2 in the input, the cells in the same row, three to the left and three to the right are set to 3s, and in the same column, three above and three below. But in Example 0's row 2, the 2 at column 7 has 3s three to the left (column 4?) but no, in the output, it's columns 6-8. \n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the positions of the 3s relative to the 2s. Let's take another example from Example 1's input and output.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 4: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,2]. Output row 4: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,3,2]. Wait, the input has 2s at columns 2, 10, 13, 15. The output adds a 3 at column 14. So for the 2 at column 13, the next cell to the right (14) is set to 3. But the 2 at column 15 (index 15) can't have a right neighbor. \n\nSo it seems that for each 2, the cell to the left and right are set to 3, provided they are within bounds and 0. Similarly, the cells above and below. For example, in Example 1's input row 4, the 2 at column 2 has no 3s around it in the output. Wait, in output row 4, the 2 at column 2 is still 2, but there are no 3s around it. This suggests that perhaps the 3s are only added for certain 2s, or there are other conditions. \n\nWait, in Example 1's input row 4: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,2]. The output is [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,3,2]. So the 2 at column 13 (0-based) has a 3 to the right (14), and the 2 at column 15 (15) has no 3 to the right (since it's the last element). The 2 at column 2 has no 3s around it. Why? Maybe because there's another 2 nearby? No, the input has a 2 at column 2, and the output doesn't add 3s around it. Hmm. \n\nThis inconsistency makes it harder to find the pattern. Maybe the 3s are added only when certain conditions are met, like the 2 is part of a cluster. Or perhaps the transformation is different. \n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's output, the 3s are added in a way that forms a kind of border around groups of 2s. For instance, the 2s in rows 2 and 3, column 7 are surrounded by 3s. But the 2 in row 4, column 13 is also surrounded by 3s. \n\nWait, in Example 0's input row 4, there's a 2 at column 13. The output row 4 has 3s in columns 6-8. That's not near column 13. This suggests that there's another 2 in the vicinity influencing those 3s. But there's no other 2 in row 4 except at 13. Unless the 3s are coming from a 2 in a neighboring row. Looking at row 3, which has a 2 at column 7. The output row 4 has 3s in columns 6-8, which are below row 3's 2 at column 7. So perhaps the 3s in row 4's columns 6-8 are from the 2 in row 3, column 7. So each 2 generates 3s in the row below, three cells centered on the same column. \n\nIn that case, the 2 in row 3, column 7 would create 3s in row 4, columns 6-8. Yes, that fits. So the pattern is that each 2 in row r, column c causes the following:\n\n- In the same row r: c-1, c+1 become 3.\n- In the row above r-1: c-1, c, c+1 become 3.\n- In the row below r+1: c-1, c, c+1 become 3.\n\nSo each 2 creates a cross of 3s in the same row (left and right) and the rows above and below (three cells centered on c).\n\nLet's test this with Example 0's input row 2, column 7:\n\n- Same row (r=2): c-1=6, c+1=8 \u2192 3s.\n- Row above (r=1): c-1=6, c=7, c+1=8 \u2192 3s.\n- Row below (r=3): same as row 1 \u2192 3s.\n\nThis matches the output.\n\nAnother 2 in input row 2, column 2:\n\n- Same row (r=2): c-1=1, c+1=3 \u2192 but in the output row 2, there's a 2 at c=2, and 0s at 1 and 3. So this doesn't fit. Hmm, why?\n\nWait, the output for row 2 in Example 0 is [0,0,2,0,0,0,3,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 3s are at 6 and 8, which are c=6 and 8. But according to the previous rule, the 2 at c=2 should have 3s at 1 and 3. But they are 0. So this rule doesn't hold for that 2. What's different about that 2?\n\nMaybe there's another factor. Let's look at other 2s. The 2 in row 12 of Example 0's input: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is the same as the input. No 3s added. So why isn't this 2 generating 3s around it? Because it's at the edge? Maybe the rule is different for 2s that are at the edges of the grid. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are only added for 2s that are in certain positions or have certain neighbors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are added only when a 2 has another 2 in the same column or row. But in Example 0, the 2 in row 2, column 7 is near another 2 in row 3, column 7. Maybe that's why the 3s are added there. But the 2 in row 2, column 2 has no nearby 2s, so no 3s are added. So the pattern might be that a 2 only generates 3s if there's another 2 adjacent to it in the same row or column. \n\nIn Example 0's input, the 2s in row 2 and 3, column 7 are vertically aligned. So they form a vertical pair. This might trigger the 3s around them. The 2 in row 4, column 13 is alone, but in the output, row 4 has 3s in columns 6-8. These 3s must be due to another 2. Looking back, the 2 in row 3, column 7 might be causing those 3s in row 4, columns 6-8. So each 2 creates 3s in the rows above and below, three cells wide. \n\nAlternatively, the rule is: for each 2, add 3s in the cells directly above, below, to the left, and right, and also the cells adjacent to those. \n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to approach this systematically. Let's compare the input and output for each 2 and see where the 3s are added.\n\nTake Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput rows with 2s:\n\nRow 2: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nRow 12: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 14: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nNow, the output for these rows:\n\nRow 2 output: [0,0,2,0,0,0,3,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3 output: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4 output: [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8 output: same as input.\n\nRow 12 output: same as input.\n\nRow 14 output: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]\n\nSo in the output, the 3s are added around the 2s in rows 2,3,4, but not around the 2s in rows 8,12,14. Why? \n\nLooking at the 2s in rows 2 and 3, column 7: these are vertically aligned. The 2 in row 4, column 13 is alone. But the output row 4 has 3s in columns 6-8, which must be due to another 2. Let's check row 3's 2 at column 7. The output for row 4 (below row 3) has 3s in columns 6-8. So the 2 in row 3, column 7 causes the row below (row 4) to have 3s in columns 6-8. That's three cells centered on column 7. So perhaps each 2 causes the rows above and below to have a three-cell-wide horizontal line of 3s centered on the 2's column. Additionally, the same row's left and right cells are set to 3. \n\nSo the rule could be:\n\nFor each 2 in row r, column c:\n\n1. In the same row (r), set c-1 and c+1 to 3, if possible.\n2. In the row above (r-1), set columns c-1, c, c+1 to 3, if possible.\n3. In the row below (r+1), set columns c-1, c, c+1 to 3, if possible.\n\nThis would explain the 3s in the examples. Let's test this with Example 0's row 2, column 7:\n\n1. Same row: columns 6 and 8 become 3.\n2. Row above (1): columns 6,7,8 become 3.\n3. Row below (3): columns 6,7,8 become 3.\n\nThis matches the output.\n\nAnother example: the 2 in row 3, column 7:\n\n1. Same row: columns 6 and 8 become 3.\n2. Row above (2): columns 6,7,8 become 3 (but row 2's columns 6 and 8 are already 3 from the previous 2).\n3. Row below (4): columns 6,7,8 become 3.\n\nThis explains why row 4's columns 6-8 are 3s even though the 2 is in row 4, column 13.\n\nSo the 2 in row 3, column 7 is responsible for the 3s in row 4's columns 6-8. \n\nNow, why doesn't the 2 in row 4, column 13 generate any 3s in the same row's columns 12 and 14, and the rows above and below?\n\nIn the output row 4, the 2 is at column 13. According to the rule:\n\n1. Same row: columns 12 and 14 should be 3. But in the output row 4, those columns are 0 and 0. So this doesn't happen. Why?\n\nAh, maybe because the rule applies only when the adjacent cells are 0. Let's check the input for row 4. The input row 4 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]. So columns 12 is 0 and 14 is 0. So according to the rule, they should be 3. But in the output, they remain 0. So this suggests that the rule is not being applied here. Why? \n\nMaybe there's an exception for 2s that are in certain positions. For example, if the 2 is at the edge of the grid, then the adjacent cells might not exist. But column 13 is not at the edge. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is different. Maybe the 3s are only added when there's another 2 adjacent in some way. For example, if a 2 has another 2 in the same row or column within a certain distance, then the 3s are added. \n\nIn Example 0's row 4, the 2 is alone. So no 3s are added. But this contradicts the previous examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are added only if the 2 is part of a vertical pair. For example, the 2s in rows 2 and 3, column 7 are vertically aligned, so they generate 3s around them. The 2 in row 4, column 13 is alone, so no 3s. But then why does the 2 in row 3, column 7 generate 3s in row 4, columns 6-8? That would require the 2 to be part of a vertical pair. \n\nThis is getting too inconsistent. Perhaps the correct rule is that 3s are added around every 2, but in some cases, the 3s are overwritten by other 2s. For example, if two 2s are close, their 3s might overlap. \n\nBut in Example 0's row 2, the 2 at column 2 has no 3s around it. Why? Because there's no other 2 nearby? Or because it's at the beginning of the row? \n\nAlternatively, the 3s are only added when there's a 2 in the same column in the previous or next row. So the 2 in row 2, column 7 has a 2 in row 3, same column, so 3s are added. But the 2 in row 2, column 2 has no such neighbor, so no 3s. \n\nThis might explain why some 2s generate 3s and others don't. But how to confirm this. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nRow 0 has 2s at columns 8,9,13.\n\nRow 4 has 2s at columns 2,10,13,15.\n\nIn the output, the 3s are added around these 2s. For example, row 0's 2 at 8 has a 3 at 7 and 10 (left and right of the pair 8 and 9). The 3s in row 1, columns 7-10 are likely due to the 2s in row 0. \n\nIf the rule is that 3s are added around 2s that have another 2 in the same row or column. For example, the 2s in row 0, columns 8 and 9 are adjacent in the same row, so 3s are added around them. \n\nSimilarly, the 2 in row 4, column 13 has a 2 in column 15 (same row), but they are two apart. So perhaps if two 2s are in the same row or column and within a certain distance, their 3s are added. \n\nBut this is getting too speculative. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that each 2 generates a vertical and horizontal cross of 3s. For each 2 in row r, column c:\n\n- In the same row, set c-1 and c+1 to 3.\n- In the row above (r-1), set c-1, c, c+1 to 3.\n- In the row below (r+1), set c-1, c, c+1 to 3.\n\nApplying this to the test input. Let's take the test input and apply this rule.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\nRow 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\nRow 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 7: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 8: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nRow 9: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nRow 10: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 11: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 12: [0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 13: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nRow 14: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\nRow 15: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 16: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNow, applying the rule to each 2:\n\nLet's process each row:\n\nRow 0 has a 2 at column 15 (last element).\n\n- Same row: columns 14 and 16. But since row 0 has 16 elements (0-15), column 16 is out of bounds. So only column 14 is set to 3.\n- Row above: row -1 (doesn't exist).\n- Row below: row 1. Set columns 14,15,16 (but 16 is out of bounds). So columns 14 and 15. But row 1's columns are 0-15. So columns 14 and 15. But row 1's input has no 2s yet. So output row 0 will have 3 at 14, and row 1's columns 14 and 15 become 3.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nRow 0 output: [0,...,0,3,2]\n\nRow 1's output: columns 14 and 15 are 3, but the input row 1 has a 2 at column 4. Let's process that.\n\nRow 1 has a 2 at column 4.\n\n- Same row: columns 3 and 5 become 3.\n- Row above (0): columns 3,4,5 become 3.\n- Row below (2): columns 3,4,5 become 3.\n\nSo row 0's columns 3-5 become 3.\n\nRow 1's columns 3,5 become 3.\n\nRow 2's columns 3-5 become 3.\n\nProceeding to row 3, which has 2s at columns 13 and 15.\n\nFor each 2 in row 3:\n\n2 at 13:\n\n- Same row: columns 12 and 14 become 3.\n- Row above (2): columns 12-14 become 3.\n- Row below (4): columns 12-14 become 3.\n\n2 at 15:\n\n- Same row: column 14 and 16 (out of bounds). Only column 14 becomes 3.\n- Row above (2): columns 14-16 (14 and 15).\n- Row below (4): columns 14-16 (14 and 15).\n\nSo row 3's output will have 3s at 12,14 (from 13) and 14 (from 15). The row above (row 2) columns 12-14 and 14-15 become 3. Row below (row 4) columns 12-14 and 14-15 become 3.\n\nBut row 4's input has 2s at 8 and 9. So when we process those, their 3s will be added as well.\n\nThis process is time-consuming, but I'll try to proceed step by step for each 2 in the test input.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to apply the rule to each 2 and generate the output.\n\nThe final answer will be structured as the examples, with each row transformed according to the rule.",
