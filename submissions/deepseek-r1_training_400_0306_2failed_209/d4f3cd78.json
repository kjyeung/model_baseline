        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, both inputs are 10x10 grids with 0s and 5s, and the outputs replace some 0s with 8s. Let me compare the input and output for each example to see where the 8s are added.\n\nStarting with Example 0: In the input, there's a structure made of 5s. The output adds 8s in the inner area. The original 5s form a sort of square or rectangle. The inner part (the 0s inside the 5s) becomes 8s. Wait, but in Example 0's input, the third row from the bottom (row 7) has 5s in a pattern like 5,5,5,0,5,5. Then in the output, that row becomes 5,5,5,8,5,5. Also, the bottom two rows have a single 8 in the sixth column. Hmm, maybe the 8s are filling in certain regions connected to the original 5 structure.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 0, the 8s are inside the 5s' rectangle. Like rows 3-6, columns 3-6 (assuming 0-based or 1-based indexing). Wait, the input's rows 2 and 7 (if rows start at 0) have 5s forming a horizontal line. The vertical lines are in columns 2 and 7. The inner part (columns 3-6, rows 3-6) are 0s which turn into 8s. Also, in the output, the bottom two rows (rows 8 and 9) have an 8 in column 5. That seems to be extending downward from where the 5 structure ends.\n\nExample 1's input is similar but inverted. The 5 structure is at the bottom. The output has 8s above the structure in column 5, going up, and then the inner part of the 5s are replaced with 8s again. So in the input, the 5s form a U-shape at the bottom. The output fills the inside with 8s and extends the 8s upward in column 5, creating a vertical line of 8s from the bottom structure up to the top.\n\nPutting this together, it looks like the pattern is that the 8s are filling the enclosed areas within the 5s and also extending downward or upward through certain columns. Wait, in Example 0's output, the 8s in column 5 (middle column) go down from row 7 to 9. In Example 1's output, the 8s in column 5 go up from the 5s structure (which is at the bottom) all the way up to the top rows. So maybe the 8s are filling the \"inside\" of the 5 structure and then extending along a central column either up or down depending on where the 5s are.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 8s are filling the regions that are enclosed by the 5s and then creating a vertical line in the middle. Let's check the positions. For Example 0, the original 5s form a sort of rectangle. The inside 0s are replaced by 8s, and then there's a vertical line of 8s going down the middle column (column 5) starting from the bottom of the 5 structure. In Example 0, the 5 structure's middle column is column 5, and the 8s extend down from row 7 to 9 in column 5. Similarly, in Example 1, the 5 structure is at the bottom, and the 8s extend upward from row 5 (the structure's top part) up to the top in column 5.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\n1. Identify the main structure made of 5s. This structure forms a kind of container (like a rectangle or U-shape).\n2. Replace all the 0s that are inside this structure with 8s. The inside is determined by being surrounded by 5s on all sides (like the inner area of a rectangle).\n3. Additionally, create a vertical line of 8s in the middle column (column 5) starting from the structure's position and extending to the edge of the grid. In Example 0, the structure is in the middle, and the line goes down. In Example 1, the structure is at the bottom, so the line goes up.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's input, the structure is a rectangle with a missing part in the middle of the bottom row. The output fills that missing part (row 7, column 5) with an 8 and continues the line down. Similarly, in Example 1, the structure is a U-shape at the bottom. The vertical line of 8s starts at the opening of the U and goes up.\n\nAnother approach: The 8s form a vertical line in column 5 (the sixth column, since index starts at 0?), starting from the position where the 5s create a \"gap\" in their structure. For example, in Example 0's input, the fifth row (row 7) has 5s except for column 5, which is 0. In the output, that 0 becomes 8, and the 8s continue down. In Example 1's input, the fifth row from the bottom (row 5) has 5s except column 5, which is 0. The output fills that with 8 and continues upward.\n\nSo maybe the algorithm is:\n\n- Find the position in the 5 structure where there's a 0 in column 5 (middle column) of the 5 structure's row. Replace that 0 with 8 and extend the 8s in column 5 towards the nearest edge (down or up).\n\nAdditionally, fill all the 0s that are enclosed by the 5 structure with 8s.\n\nTesting this with the examples:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the fifth column (index 5) in row 7 (assuming rows start at 0) is 0. So replacing that with 8 and extending down. Also, the inner 0s inside the 5 structure become 8s.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 5 structure's row 5 (if the input is from bottom to top, but in the input given, row 5 is the sixth row from the top) has a 0 in column 5. Replacing that with 8 and extending upward.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nLooking at the test input's structure. The 5s are in rows 2,3,4,6,7 (0-based). Let's see:\n\nRow 2: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0] \u2014 columns 2-6 are 5s except column 7 becomes 0.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2014 5s at columns 2 and 6.\n\nRow 4: same as row 3.\n\nRow 5: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2014 5 at column 2, then 0s.\n\nRow 6: [0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2014 5s at columns 2 and 6.\n\nRow 7: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0] \u2014 columns 2-6 are 5s.\n\nSo the 5s form a sort of irregular shape. The inner area would be where 0s are surrounded by 5s. For example, in rows 3 and 4, columns 3-5 are 0s between 5s. Similarly, row 6 has 0s between columns 3-5 if surrounded by 5s. But row 5 has a 5 at column 2, and the rest 0s. So maybe the inner area to fill is in rows 3,4,6 and columns 3-5. Also, in row 5, there's a 5 at column 2 but no closing 5 on the right, so maybe not enclosed.\n\nThen, the vertical line: looking for a 0 in column 5 (middle column) within the 5 structure. Let's check each row of the 5 structure:\n\nRow 2: column 5 is 5 (part of the 5s). So no.\n\nRow 3: column 5 is 0. So this might be the starting point. But wait, row 3 has 5 at column 2 and 6. So the 0s in columns 3-5 are enclosed between the 5s. In the output, these 0s would become 8s. Then, the vertical line in column 5 would start here and extend upwards or downwards?\n\nBut in the test input's 5 structure, the top part is row 2 (a horizontal line of 5s from column 2 to 6). Then rows 3,4,6 have 5s at columns 2 and 6. Row 5 has a 5 at column 2 but not at 6. So the structure is broken in row 5. Therefore, the enclosed area would be in rows 3,4,6, columns 3-5. Row 5's 0s are not enclosed because there's no 5 on column 6.\n\nSo replacing those enclosed 0s with 8s. Then, the vertical line in column 5. Let's see where the 0s in column 5 are. In the test input, column 5:\n\nRow 0: 0\n\nRow 1:0\n\nRow 2:5\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:5\n\nRows 8 and 9:0.\n\nSo in the 5 structure, the 0s in column 5 are in rows 3,4,5,6. But since the structure breaks in row5, maybe the vertical line starts from the first 0 in column5 that's part of the enclosed area. For example, in rows 3,4,6, the column5 0s are enclosed. But row5's column5 is 0 but not enclosed (since row5 has a 0 in column6). So perhaps the vertical line starts from row3's column5 (which is enclosed) and extends upwards and downwards as much as possible.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the vertical line starts at row7's column5 (which was 0 in input) and extends down to rows 8 and 9. In Example 1, the vertical line starts at row5's column5 (input 0) and extends up to rows 0-4.\n\nIn the test input, the first 0 in column5 that's part of the enclosed area would be rows3,4,6. But row7's column5 is 5 (part of the 5 structure). So perhaps the vertical line starts from row3's column5, which is an enclosed 0, and extends upwards and downwards where possible. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is created by following the column where the 5 structure has a gap. For example, in Example0's input, the structure's bottom row (row7) has a gap at column5. That's where the vertical line starts. Then in the test input, perhaps the gap is in row5's column5. Wait, in test input row5 is [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So column5 is 0, but there's no 5 on the right (column6 is 0). So maybe not part of the structure. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the lowest row in the structure where column5 is 0. Let's look at the test input's structure rows (rows2,3,4,6,7):\n\nRow2: columns2-6 are 5s. So column5 is 5.\n\nRow3: columns2 and 6 are 5. Column5 is 0.\n\nRow4: same as row3.\n\nRow6: columns2 and 6 are 5. Column5 is 0.\n\nRow7: columns2-6 are 5. Column5 is 5.\n\nSo the gaps in column5 are in rows3,4,6. But these are enclosed between 5s on left (column2) and right (column6) except for row5. But row5's column6 is 0, so the structure is broken there.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the vertical line is created in column5 from the highest row in the structure where column5 is 0, extending up, and from the lowest such row extending down. Or perhaps it's connected to the \"mouth\" of the 5 structure.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical line in column5 starts from the first 0 in column5 within the structure and extends to the edge. For example, in Example0, the vertical line starts at row7's column5 (originally 0) and extends down. In Example1, it starts at row5's column5 and extends up. So for the test input, perhaps the vertical line starts at row3's column5 (the first 0 in column5 within the structure) and extends upward and downward through column5. But how?\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the vertical line starts at row7, column5 (the original 0) and goes down to rows8 and9. In Example1's output, it starts at row5's column5 and goes up to rows0-4. So maybe the vertical line is created by extending in the direction where there are no 5s blocking. For Example0, the vertical line in column5 goes down from the gap in row7. For Example1, the line goes up from row5.\n\nIn the test input, the first occurrence of a 0 in column5 within the 5 structure is row3. Then, perhaps the vertical line would go upward from row3's column5. But rows0-2 in column5 are 0s (except row2 which is 5). So starting at row3, moving up: row2's column5 is 5, so can't go up. So maybe the line only extends downward. Let's see.\n\nTest input's column5: in rows3,4,5,6, the values are 0. Rows3 and4 are part of the structure (since columns2 and6 are 5s in those rows). So in the output, those 0s would become 8s. Then, the vertical line in column5 would start from row3's column5 (now 8) and extend down to rows4,5,6,7, etc., but row7's column5 is 5. So the line can go from row3 down to row6. But row5's column5 is 0 but not part of the structure (since column6 is 0 there). Hmm. Maybe the vertical line is allowed to pass through any 0s in column5 beyond the structure's boundary. For example, in Example0, the line goes down to the bottom two rows. In the test input, after the structure's rows, rows8 and9 are all 0s. So maybe the line continues down from row6's column5 (now 8) to rows7 (but row7's column5 is 5, so stop) and rows8,9. Wait, but row7's column5 is 5, so the line can't go past it. So perhaps the vertical line in column5 for the test input would start at row3, extend down to row6 (since those are part of the enclosed area), and then continue down through rows7 (but it's a 5), so stop. But rows8 and9 are 0s. Hmm, perhaps the line is allowed to go through all 0s in column5 below the first 8. Let me check the examples.\n\nIn Example0's output, the vertical line starts at row7, column5, then rows8 and9 have 8s. So it extends down past the structure. Similarly, in Example1's output, the vertical line starts at row5 and goes up to row0. So even if the 0s are outside the original structure, as long as they are in column5, they become 8s.\n\nSo the rule might be: for the vertical line in column5, all 0s in column5 starting from the first 8 (from the structure) and extending to the nearest edge (up or down). For example, in Example0, the first 8 in column5 is at row7, then extend down to the bottom. In Example1, the first 8 is at row5, then extend up to the top.\n\nSo applying this to the test input. The structure's first 8 in column5 would be row3 (since in input row3, column5 is 0 and part of the enclosed area). Then, the vertical line would extend upward and downward from there. But row2's column5 is 5 (part of the structure), so upward movement is blocked. Downward: rows3,4,5,6 in column5. Row5 is not part of the enclosed area (since column6 is 0 there), but maybe the line extends through all 0s in column5 starting from the initial 8. So from row3 to row6, those are enclosed (rows3,4,6 have 5s on both sides), but row5 is not. So the line would include row3,4,6. But row5 is not part of the structure. However, in the examples, the vertical line includes rows that were originally 0 in column5 even if they are outside the structure. For instance, in Example0, the line extends to rows8 and9 which were all 0s. So maybe the rule is: once the initial 8 is placed (the first 0 in column5 that is part of the enclosed area), then all 0s in column5 from that row to the edge (either top or bottom) are replaced with 8s.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nThe first 8 in column5 is row3. Then, in column5, starting from row3, replace all 0s below (downwards) until a non-zero is hit. Row7's column5 is 5 (part of the structure), so the line would go from row3 to row6. Then rows7 is blocked. But rows8 and9 are 0s, but since row7 is blocked, they wouldn't be part of the line. Alternatively, perhaps the line continues down past row7. Wait, in Example0's output, the line goes from row7 down to rows8 and9 even though row7 is part of the structure and has an 8 in column5. So maybe after replacing the initial 8, the vertical line in column5 extends to the edge (top or bottom) regardless of other structures.\n\nWait in Example0's output, rows8 and9 are 0s in the input. But in the output, they have 8s in column5. So the line continues past the structure's boundaries. So even if there are 0s beyond the structure, they get replaced with 8s in column5.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nThe vertical line in column5 would start at row3 (enclosed area) and extend downward to the bottom. So rows3,4,5,6,7 (but row7's column5 is 5 in input, but in output, maybe after replacing row3,4,6's 0s with 8s, and then continuing down, but row7's column5 is 5, so the line stops at row6. Then rows8 and9 are 0s but not part of the vertical line since there's a 5 in row7 blocking.\n\nWait, no. In Example0, the line starts at row7's column5 (input 0) and continues to rows8 and9. Even though those rows are outside the structure. So perhaps once the line starts, it extends all the way to the edge, regardless of other elements.\n\nSo for the test input, the line starts at row3's column5 (enclosed 0 becomes 8), then all 0s in column5 from row3 down to row9 would be replaced with 8s. Let's check:\n\nIn the test input's column5:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:5\n\nRow3:0 (enclosed, becomes 8)\n\nRow4:0 (enclosed, becomes 8)\n\nRow5:0 (not enclosed, but if the vertical line is all 0s in column5 from row3 down, then these would also become 8s)\n\nRow6:0 (enclosed, becomes 8)\n\nRow7:5 (remains 5)\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:0\n\nSo, according to this logic, the vertical line would be rows3-9 in column5, but row7 is 5. So only rows3-6 (enclosed) and rows5 (if allowed). But in the examples, the line extends even beyond the structure. For instance, in Example0, the line goes from row7 down to rows8-9. So perhaps after the initial 8 in column5, all 0s in that column below it are replaced with 8s, regardless of whether they are in the structure.\n\nSo in the test input, after replacing the enclosed 0s with 8s (rows3,4,6 in column5), then check all cells in column5 from row3 downwards. So rows3,4,5,6,7,8,9. But row7's column5 is 5, so it's not replaced. Rows5,8,9 are 0s, so they become 8s. So the vertical line in column5 would be rows3,4,5,6,8,9. But wait, row5's column5 is 0 but not enclosed. But according to the pattern from examples, the line includes all 0s in column5 from the starting point to the edge. So even if those 0s are not enclosed, they become 8s. So in the test input's output, column5 would have 8s in rows3,4,5,6,8,9. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nIn Example1, the vertical line starts at row5's column5 and extends upward to rows0-4. These rows were all 0s in the input and not part of the structure, but they became 8s. So yes, the vertical line replaces all 0s in column5 from the starting point to the edge.\n\nTherefore, in the test input:\n\n- Replace all enclosed 0s with 8s. Enclosed areas are where 0s are surrounded by 5s on left and right (columns2 and6 in rows3,4,6). Also, the vertical line in column5 from the starting 8 (row3's column5) down to the bottom (rows3-9, except row7 is 5).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Replace all 0s that are enclosed by 5s (horizontally) in each row. For example, rows3,4,6 where columns2 and6 are 5, so the 0s in between become 8s.\n\n2. In column5, starting from the first row where an 8 was placed (row3), replace all 0s below that row in column5 with 8s, continuing until the edge (row9).\n\nSo for the test input's column5:\n\n- Row3: 8\n\n- Row4:8\n\n- Row5:0 \u2192 becomes 8\n\n- Row6:8\n\n- Row7:5 \u2192 stays 5\n\n- Row8:0 \u2192 becomes 8\n\n- Row9:0 \u2192 becomes 8\n\nSo the vertical line in column5 would have 8s in rows3,4,5,6,8,9.\n\nNow applying this to the test input.\n\nLet's process each row:\n\nRow2 (original): [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0] \u2192 columns2-6 are 5s. No 0s to replace here. So output remains the same.\n\nRow3: [0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Columns3-5 are 0s between 5s. Replace with 8s \u2192 [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0].\n\nRow4: same as row3 \u2192 [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0].\n\nRow5: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Columns3-5 are 0s, but column6 is 0, so not enclosed. So only replace if part of vertical line. Since column5 is part of the vertical line, row5's column5 becomes 8. So row5 becomes [0,0,5,0,0,8,0,0,0,0].\n\nWait, but according to the vertical line rule, column5's 0s from row3 down are replaced. So row5's column5 becomes 8. So the entire row5 would be [0,0,5,0,0,8,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow6: [0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Columns3-5 are 0s between 5s \u2192 replaced with 8s \u2192 [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0]. Also, column5 is part of vertical line, but already replaced.\n\nRow7: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0]. Column5 is 5, so remains.\n\nRows8 and9: All 0s. Their column5 becomes 8s due to the vertical line.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nThe test input's output would look like:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row0, column5 becomes 8? Wait no. Wait in the vertical line processing, the line starts at row3. So only from row3 down. Row0 and1's column5 are 0s but not part of the vertical line. Wait, in Example1's output, the vertical line starts at row5 and goes up to rows0-4. So in that case, rows0-4's column5 are 8s. So the direction depends on where the starting point is. In the test input's case, the starting point is row3. So the vertical line would extend downward from row3 to row9, replacing all 0s in column5 from row3 to row9. So rows3,4,5,6,8,9's column5 are 8s. Row7's column5 is 5, so remains.\n\nSo the test output's rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column5 remains 0.\n\nRow1: same as row0.\n\nRow2: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0] \u2192 no change except vertical line.\n\nWait no, row2's column5 is 5, so it stays. The vertical line starts at row3. So row0 and1's column5 are 0, but not part of the vertical line.\n\nSo the final output rows would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,5,0,0,8,0,0,0,0] (column5 is 8)\n\nRow6: [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0] (column5 becomes 8)\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but in row5, the columns3-5 are 0,0,8. So column3 and4 are 0s, but they are not part of the enclosed area (since column6 is 0 in row5). So only column5 becomes 8 due to the vertical line. The other 0s in row5 remain 0.\n\nThis matches our earlier analysis. So the final output would have the enclosed areas filled with 8s (rows3,4,6), and column5 from row3 down to row9 (excluding row7) replaced with 8s.\n\nChecking if this matches the examples' patterns. Yes, in Example0, the enclosed area and vertical line. In Example1, the vertical line extends upward. The test case's vertical line extends downward.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, both inputs have a structure made of 5s, and the outputs replace some of the 0s with 8s. Let me see how exactly they do that.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 10x10 grid. The 5s form a sort of rectangle or maybe a frame. The output replaces the inner part of the 5 structure with 8s. Wait, in the input, rows 2 and 7 are 5s except the first two and last two zeros. Then rows 3-6 have 5s at the edges and 0s inside. The output for these rows changes those inner 0s to 8s. Also, looking at rows 8 and 9 in the output, there are 8s in the middle (position 5). Hmm, maybe that's where the 5s frame isn't enclosing that area anymore, so it extends downward?\n\nIn Example 1, the input's 5 structure is at the bottom. The output has a column of 8s in the middle (column 5) going up from the 5 structure. The 8s are placed where the 0s were adjacent to the 5s but in a vertical line. So perhaps the 8s are filling regions that are enclosed by 5s and possibly extending along a vertical or horizontal path?\n\nWait, maybe the 8s are filling areas that are enclosed by 5s and connected vertically or horizontally. Or maybe the 8s are filling the \"interior\" of the 5 structure. Let me visualize. In Example 0, the input's 5s form a sort of rectangular ring. The inner part of that ring is replaced by 8s. Then, in the output, rows 8 and 9 have 8s in column 5. That might be a vertical line extending down from the 5 structure. So perhaps the 8s fill the interior of the 5s and also any vertical or horizontal paths that are now open.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are added along certain directions. Let's check the outputs.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 8s are inside the 5 rectangle, but also, in rows 8 and 9, column 5, there's a vertical line of 8s. Looking at the input for Example 0, in row 7, the 5s are arranged as 5,5,5,5,8,5,5 (positions 2 to 7 in row 7). Wait, no, the input row 7 is [0,0,5,5,5,0,5,5,0,0], but the output changes the 0 in position 5 to 8. So maybe when there's a 0 that's surrounded by 5s in certain directions, it becomes an 8. Or perhaps the 8s are part of a path that's connected to the main 5 structure but extends in a particular direction.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 0s turn into 8s. For Example 0, the inner 4x4 area of the 5 rectangle becomes 8s, and then there's a vertical line of 8s extending down from the middle. In the input, the original 5s in row 7 (input) have a 0 at position 5 (0-based index?), which in the output becomes 8, and then below that, rows 8 and 9's position 5 become 8s. So maybe when there's a 0 that's directly below a 5 in the same column, and there's a path downward, those 0s become 8s. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are filling all the 0s that are enclosed by 5s. But in Example 0, the vertical line of 8s in column 5 in the last two rows isn't enclosed by 5s. So that's not it.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the 5 structure in row 7 (0-based index 7) is [0,0,5,5,5,0,5,5,0,0]. So the middle part (index 5) is 0. In the output, that becomes 8. Then, rows 8 and 9 have 8 in column 5. So maybe once a 0 is changed to 8, any 0s below it in the same column also become 8s. So it's like filling down from that point. So the initial 8 in row 7, column 5 propagates downward. But how was that initial 8 chosen?\n\nIn the input of Example 0, the 0 at (7,5) (row 7, column 5) is surrounded by 5s on left and right? Let's check the input row 7: [0,0,5,5,5,0,5,5,0,0]. So positions 2-4 are 5, position 5 is 0, then positions 6-7 are 5. So that 0 is between 5s. So maybe when a 0 is between 5s horizontally, it's replaced by 8. Then, any 0s below that in the same column are also replaced by 8.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the input's 5 structure is at the bottom. The output has a vertical line of 8s in column 5 going up. For example, in the input row 5 (0-based), the 5s are [0,0,5,5,5,0,5,5,0,0]. So position 5 is 0. In the output, this becomes 8, and then all the rows above (rows 0-4) have 8s in column 5. So again, the 0 in position 5 of row 5 becomes 8, and all the 0s above in the same column become 8s.\n\nSo the pattern might be: look for 0s that are in a horizontal line between 5s (i.e., surrounded by 5s on left and right in the same row), replace them with 8, and then fill all 0s in the same column above or below (depending on the position) with 8s.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 0 that's replaced is in row 7, column 5. Then rows 8 and 9 (below) in column 5 are 0s, which become 8s. In Example 1, the replaced 0 is in row 5, column 5, and then rows above (0-4) in column 5 are 0s turned to 8. So the direction depends on where the original 0 is in the structure. So maybe, whenever there's a 0 that is sandwiched horizontally between 5s in the same row, that 0 becomes 8, and then all 0s in that column (above or below) that are contiguous and reachable are also turned into 8s. So it's like a flood fill from the initial 8 position upwards or downwards.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. For each row, check if there's a 0 that is between two 5s in the same row. If yes, replace that 0 with 8.\n\n2. Then, for each such 8, check the cells above and below in the same column. If they are 0, replace them with 8, and continue this until there are no more 0s in that column direction.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, after the initial 8 at (7,5), the 8s propagate downward (rows 8 and 9, column 5). In Example 1, the initial 8 is at (5,5), and the 8s propagate upward (rows 0-4, column 5). So the direction of propagation depends on the location of the initial 8. Maybe if the initial 8 is in the upper part of the 5 structure, it propagates upward, and if in the lower part, downward? Or maybe it propagates in both directions, but in the examples, there are only 0s in one direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial 8 is part of the 5 structure's \"hole\" and then the 8s fill the entire column in the direction where there are 0s. For example, in Example 0, the initial 8 is in the bottom part of the 5 structure, so the 8s below are filled. In Example 1, the initial 8 is in the upper part of the 5 structure (since the 5s are at the bottom), so the 8s fill upward.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\n- Find all 0s in the grid that are horizontally between two 5s (i.e., in the same row, there are 5s on both the left and right of the 0). Replace those 0s with 8s.\n\n- Then, for each such 8, look in the column above and below. If there's a 0, replace it with 8, and continue until no more 0s are found in that column direction.\n\nSo for each initial 8 (from step 1), perform a vertical flood fill in both directions (up and down) to replace 0s with 8s.\n\nNow let's check if that works for the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nOriginal input has in row 7, columns 2-7: 5,5,5,0,5,5. The 0 at column 5 (index 5) is between 5s. So replaced with 8. Then, check the column 5 in rows below (8 and 9). Both are 0, so replace them with 8.\n\nIn row 3-6, the inner 0s are between 5s. For example, in row 3, columns 3-6 (assuming 0-based), the 5s are at the start and end, so the 0s in between are replaced by 8s. Then, for each of these 8s, check up and down. But in their columns, there are 0s above and below. Wait, but in Example 0's output, the 8s in rows 3-6 are in columns 3-6. For example, row 3 has 8s from column 3 to 6. So perhaps each of those 0s between 5s in a row is replaced by 8 and then flood-filled vertically.\n\nWait no, because in row 3, the input is [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]. So the 0s in columns 3-6 are between 5 at column 2 and column 7. So each of those 0s would be replaced by 8s. Then, for each of these 8s, we check their columns. For example, column 3: after replacing the 0 in row 3, column 3 to 8, then check above and below. But in Example 0's output, rows 3-6, columns 3-6 are 8s, and rows 8-9 column 5 is 8. So maybe the initial 8s in the inner part are surrounded by 5s on all sides, so vertical flood fill doesn't go beyond, but the one in row7, column5 allows filling down.\n\nHmm, maybe the vertical flood fill only happens for the 8s that are in the middle of a horizontal line between 5s. Like, for example, in the horizontal 0s that are between 5s in their row, those 0s become 8s and then flood fill up and down. So each such 0 that is between 5s in their row is replaced by 8, and then all 0s in their column (both up and down) are replaced by 8s until a non-zero is encountered.\n\nLet me test this logic with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1's input, row 5 is [0,0,5,5,5,0,5,5,0,0]. The 0 at column 5 is between 5s (columns 4 and 6). So it's replaced by 8. Then, in column 5, the 0s above (rows 0-4) are replaced by 8s. So the vertical flood fill goes up. Then, the 0s below (row6-9) in column5: row6 in input is [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0], so column5 is 0. But in the output, row6, column5 is 8. Wait, but according to the algorithm, once the initial 8 is placed at row5, column5, then we check up and down. Down would be row6, column5. If that's 0, replace it with 8, then check row7, etc. But in Example1's output, row6, column5 is 8. But in the input, row6's column5 is 0. So yes, the vertical flood fill would replace all 0s in column5 both up and down. But in Example1's output, the 8s in column5 go from row0 to row5 (including row5), and then row6-9. Wait no, the output for Example1 has 8s in column5 from row0 to row5 (rows 0-4 have 8 in column5, row5 has 8 in column5), and rows6-8 have 8s in column5 (since in row6, column5 is 8, etc. But in the output, row6, column5 is part of the 8s. So maybe the flood fill goes in both directions.\n\nWait in Example1, the initial 8 is in row5, column5. Then, the flood fill would check up (rows 4,3,2,1,0) and replace 0s with 8. Then check down (rows6,7,8,9). But in row6, the original 0 in column5 is replaced with 8, and similarly for rows7,8. But in Example1's output, the 5 structure in rows6-9: row6 has [0,0,5,8,8,8,8,5,0,0], so in column5, it's 8. So that's correct.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n1. For each cell in the grid, if the cell is 0 and there are 5s both to the left and right in the same row (i.e., the 0 is between two 5s horizontally), then replace that 0 with 8.\n\n2. For each such cell that was replaced with 8, perform a vertical flood fill: in the same column, replace all contiguous 0s above and below with 8s until a non-zero is encountered.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLooking for 0s between 5s horizontally.\n\nRow 2 (third row in the input, 0-based index 2): [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0]. So columns 2-6 are 5s. There are no 0s in between 5s here. So no 8s here.\n\nRow3: [0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Columns 2 and 6 are 5s. The 0s in columns3-5 are between them. So each of those 0s (columns3,4,5) are between 5s. So replace them with 8. Then, perform vertical flood fill for each of those columns (3,4,5).\n\nSimilarly, row4: [0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Same as row3. So columns3-5 0s become 8s.\n\nRow5: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Here, column2 is 5, but the 0s are from column3 to 6. But the right 5 is missing (since column6 is 0). So only columns3-5 are not between 5s. So no 8s here.\n\nRow6: [0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. Columns2 and6 are 5s. 0s in columns3-5 are between them. Replace with 8.\n\nRow7: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0]. All 5s in columns2-6. No 0s between 5s here.\n\nSo the initial 8s are in rows3,4,6, columns3-5.\n\nNow, for each of these 8s, perform vertical flood fill.\n\nTake column3. In row3, column3 becomes 8. Then check above and below:\n\n- Above: rows0,1,2. These are 0s. So replace them with 8s. But wait, the flood fill continues until a non-zero is encountered. So starting at row3, column3, which is 8. Then check row4 (already 8 from step1). Then row5, column3 is 0 in the input. So replace that with 8. Then row6, column3 is 0 (original input) but in the output, row6, column3 was replaced in step1 (since in row6, columns3-5 are replaced with 8). So in the flood fill from row3, column3, the column3 would have 8s from row3 down to row6. Then row7 is 5 (original input row7, column3 is 5). So flood fill stops there. For above, row3 is the first, so rows above (0-2) in column3 would be 0s, so replaced with 8s. Similarly for columns4 and5.\n\nSimilarly, for column3:\n\nOriginal after step1:\n\nRows3:8, row4:8, row6:8.\n\nBut during flood fill from row3, column3:\n\nUp: rows2,1,0. All 0s, so replaced with 8s.\n\nDown: row4 is already 8. Then row5, column3 is 0 (input). Replace with 8, then row6, column3 is 8 (from step1), then row7 is 5. So column3 in the output would have 8s from row0 to row6.\n\nSimilarly for column4 and5.\n\nLet's walk through each column where 8s were added in step1:\n\nColumns3,4,5 in rows3,4,6.\n\nFor column3:\n\nStep1: rows3,4,6 have 8s.\n\nFlood fill from each of these:\n\nStarting with row3, column3:\n\nUp: rows2,1,0. Replace 0s with 8s.\n\nDown: row4 (already 8), row5 (0 \u2192 8), row6 (8), row7 (5 \u2192 stop).\n\nSo column3 in output becomes 8 from row0 to row6.\n\nSimilarly for row4, column3: same as above.\n\nNow column4:\n\nIn step1, rows3,4,6 have 8s in column4.\n\nFlood fill from row3, column4:\n\nUp: rows2,1,0 (0s \u2192 8s).\n\nDown: row4 (8), row5 (0 \u2192 8), row6 (8), row7 (5 \u2192 stop).\n\nSo column4 in output is 8 from row0 to row6.\n\nSame for column5:\n\nStep1: rows3,4,6 have 8s in column5.\n\nFlood fill from row3, column5:\n\nUp: rows2,1,0 (0s \u2192 8s).\n\nDown: row4 (8), row5 (0 \u2192 8), row6 (8), row7 (5 \u2192 stop).\n\nSo column5 in output is 8 from row0 to row6.\n\nBut wait, in row5, column5 is 0 (input). So during the flood fill from row3, column5, we go down:\n\nrow3:8, row4:8, row5:0 \u2192 replace with 8. Then row6:8, row7:5. So column5's 8s go from row0 to row6.\n\nBut in the test input's row5, column6 is 0. Wait, the original row5 in the test input is [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So column5 is 0. So during the flood fill from step2, this becomes 8. So in the output, column5 in row5 is 8.\n\nAdditionally, the test input's row6, column5 is 0 in the input. But step1 replaces it with 8 because in row6, columns3-5 are between 5s (columns2 and6 are 5s). So row6, column5 is replaced with 8 in step1. Then during the flood fill, maybe it's redundant.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nThe output should have 8s in columns3,4,5 from rows0 to row6. And columns3,4,5 in rows3,4,6 have 8s, plus the flood fill adds 8s in rows0-2 and row5 for those columns.\n\nAdditionally, looking at row5, column5 (original input is 0), which is part of the flood fill from row3,4,6's column5.\n\nNow, let's consider the test input's row5: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 0s in columns3-6 are not between 5s (since column6 is 0). So step1 does not replace them. But during the flood fill from column5's step1 8s (rows3,4,6), the row5, column5 is 0, so replaced with 8.\n\nSo the columns3,4,5 in all rows from 0 to6 would be 8s.\n\nNow, let's check the rest:\n\nRow7 has 5s in columns2-6. So in column6, during flood fill from row3, column6 (but in step1, column6 wasn't replaced unless there's a 0 between 5s. Let's check: in row3, column6 is 5 (input), so no. So no.\n\nWhat about the vertical flood fill for column6?\n\nIn the test input, row3, column6 is 5, so no. But row6, column6 is 5. So maybe columns3-5 are the only ones with 8s.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nRows0-6, columns3-5 as 8s. Let's see:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]?\n\nWait, but the flood fill for column3 would start from row3 and go up to row0. So each of columns3,4,5 would have 8s from row0 to row6.\n\nNow, let's also check if there are other 0s that are between 5s. For example, row7, columns2-6 are 5s. Any 0s between them? No. So no 8s there.\n\nAnother possible point: in row5, column6. The input is 0. But in row5, the 5 is at column2. So no 5s around. So not replaced.\n\nNow, let's also check for vertical flood fill from any other 8s. For example, in row3, column3 is 8. The flood fill replaces column3's 0s above and below. Similarly for column4 and 5.\n\nSo the test input's output should have columns3-5 filled with 8s from row0 to row6. Rows3-6 also have 8s in those columns from step1 and flood fill.\n\nNow, let's construct the output step by step.\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow2: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0] \u2192 after step1: no change since there are no 0s between 5s here.\n\nRow3: [0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 step1 replaces columns3-5 with 8 \u2192 [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: same as row3 \u2192 [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 step1 doesn't change (no 0s between 5s), but during flood fill from columns3-5, columns3-5 in row5 become 8.\n\nRow6: [0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 step1 replaces columns3-5 with 8 \u2192 [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0]\n\nNow, after step1 and flood fill:\n\nFor columns3-5:\n\n- Row0: [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\n- Row1: [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\n- Row2: [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0] \u2192 original row2 had columns3-6 as 5s. Wait, but flood fill from column3 would replace row2's column3-5 (which were 5s?) No. Wait, original row2 is [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0]. So columns3-5 are 5s, not 0s. So during flood fill from row3's column3 (which is 8), the flood fill for column3 would start at row3 and go up to row0. But in row2, column3 is 5, so flood fill stops there. So the flood fill from row3, column3 (8) upward would replace rows0-2's column3-5. Wait, no: in the flood fill for column3, the process is:\n\nStart at row3, column3 (8). Then check up: row2, column3 is 5 (original input), so flood fill stops. So rows above row3 in column3 are not changed. Wait, this contradicts previous reasoning. Oh! I think I made a mistake earlier. The flood fill is only for the 0s. So when you replace a 0 with 8, you look up and down in that column, but only replace 0s. So if in the column above the initial 8, there are 0s, they are replaced. But if there's a non-zero (like 5), then the flood fill stops.\n\nSo for row3, column3 in the test input:\n\nAfter replacing the 0 with 8 in step1, during flood fill:\n\nCheck up (row2, column3). Original input has row2, column3 as 5. So flood fill stops. Check down (row4, column3 is 8 (from step1). Continue down to row5, column3 is 0 \u2192 replace with 8. Then row6, column3 is 8 (from step1). Then row7, column3 is 5 \u2192 stop.\n\nSo the flood fill in column3 would only replace row5's column3 to 8. Similarly for column4 and 5.\n\nWait, this changes everything. So the initial approach was wrong. So the correct process is:\n\nWhen you replace a 0 with 8 in step1, you flood fill up and down in the same column, replacing 0s with 8s until a non-zero is hit.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRow3, columns3-5 are 0s \u2192 replaced with 8s (step1).\n\nThen, for each of these 8s:\n\n- column3:\n\n   - up: row2, column3 is 5 \u2192 stop. So no changes above.\n\n   - down: row4 is already 8 (step1). row5, column3 is 0 \u2192 replace with 8. row6, column3 is 8 (step1). row7, column3 is 5 \u2192 stop.\n\nSo column3 in output:\n\nrows3-6 have 8s (from step1 and flood fill), and row5 is also 8.\n\nSimilarly for column4:\n\nrow3, column4 is 8 (step1). flood fill up: row2, column4 is 5 \u2192 stop. flood fill down: row4 (8), row5 (0 \u21928), row6 (8), row7 (5 \u2192 stop.\n\nSame for column5.\n\nSo columns3-5 in rows3-6 and row5 are 8s.\n\nAdditionally, row5, columns3-5 are 8s from flood fill.\n\nSo the rows after processing:\n\nRow0: remains all 0s except if any flood fill from columns3-5. But in this case, no, because flood fill upward from row3's columns3-5 would hit 5s in row2. So rows0-2 remain 0s except where other flood fills occur.\n\nWait, but wait:\n\nIn the test input, row3, column3 is 8. Flood fill up in column3: row2, column3 is 5 \u2192 stop. So rows0-2's column3 remains 0.\n\nSame for columns4 and5. So the flood fill from row3's columns3-5 doesn't reach rows0-2.\n\nSo the only 8s from flood fill are in row5, columns3-5.\n\nSo the final output would have:\n\nRow3: [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,5,8,8,8,0,0,0,0] \u2192 but wait, original row5 is [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. After flood fill from column3-5:\n\nIn step1, row5's columns3-5 are not replaced. But during flood fill from row3, columns3-5:\n\nrow5's columns3-5 are 0s, so replaced with 8s. So row5 becomes [0,0,5,8,8,8,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow6: [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0]\n\nRows0-2: remain as original, except columns3-5 in row3.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nThe output for the test input would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,5,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nRows8-9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but according to this, row5's column6 is 0. But in the flood fill from row3's columns3-5, column6 is not affected. However, looking back at the training examples, in Example0, there's an 8 in the middle column that propagates down. So maybe there's another part to the pattern.\n\nWait, in the test input, row7 is [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0]. Are there any 0s between 5s here? The row is 5,5,5,5,5, so no 0s. So no.\n\nBut what about row5's column6? In row5, column6 is 0, but it's not between 5s (since the right 5 is at column6 in row3, but row5's column6 is 0). So no.\n\nSo the output would have 8s in rows3-4 and6, columns3-5, plus row5's columns3-5. But according to the flood fill, row5's columns3-5 are 8s.\n\nBut let's look at the test input's row5: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. After processing, the 5 is in column2. The columns3-5 are 0s. During flood fill from row3's columns3-5, which are 8s, these 0s in row5's columns3-5 are replaced with 8s. So row5 becomes [0,0,5,8,8,8,0,0,0,0].\n\nSo the final output would look like this:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut wait, in row5, column6 is 0, which isn't part of the 8s. However, looking back at the training examples, there's another aspect. In Example0, the 8 in row7, column5 is due to being between 5s horizontally and then flooding down. In the test input, row7's columns2-6 are all 5s, so no 0s between them. So no 8s there.\n\nBut what about row6, column6? In the test input's row6, column6 is 5. So no 0s there.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the test input's row6, columns3-5 are replaced with 8s (step1), and the flood fill would have row5's columns3-5 as 8s. But row5's column6 is 0, which isn't part of any flood fill.\n\nSo the final output seems to match what I described. But does this match the training examples' patterns?\n\nIn the training examples, the 8s also propagate vertically from the initial positions. For example, in Example0, the 8 in row7, column5 leads to 8s in rows8-9. But according to the current logic, in the test input, there's no such position where a 0 is between 5s in a row and then flood fill down.\n\nIn the test input's row5, column6 is 0. But it's not between 5s. So no.\n\nSo the final output would have 8s only in columns3-5 of rows3-6 and row5, and no vertical lines extending beyond.\n\nBut let me re-examine the test input's row7. It is [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0]. The middle column (5) is part of the 5s. So no 0s there. So no 8s added in row7.\n\nThus, the final answer should be as constructed above.",
