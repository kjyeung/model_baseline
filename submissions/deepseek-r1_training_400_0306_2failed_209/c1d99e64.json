        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input list is transformed into an output list where some elements are changed to 2. Let me compare the input and output for each example.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is lists of 0s and 1s, and the output has some 2s. Let's take the first input list: [1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1]. The output changes the 9th element (index 8, since counting starts at 0) from 0 to 2. Wait, looking at the other lists in Example 0, like the next input [1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1], the output also has a 2 at position 8. Similarly, the third input's output has a 2 at position 8. So maybe the 9th element is always changed to 2? But wait, in the 9th input line of Example 0, which is all zeros, the output is all 2s. So that's different. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 9th input line is [0,0,0,...,0], and the output is all 2s. So maybe when all elements are the same (all 0s), they become 2s. But for the other lines, only a specific position is changed. Let's check the other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input lists have 8s and 0s. In the output, the fifth element (index 4) is changed to 2. For example, the first input [8,8,8,8,0,...] becomes [8,8,8,8,2,...]. The second input has a 0 at index 4, which becomes 2. The 9th input line in Example 1 is [0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8], output has 2 at index 4. But the last element in that line is 8, which is 0 in input. Wait, no, the input's index 4 is 0, which becomes 2, others are 0 or 8. And in the output, the element at index 4 is 2. Then, in the same example, there's a line where all elements are 8 except some 0s. Wait, but in the input, the fifth element (index 4) is 0, and in output it's 2. So maybe for each list in Example 1, the element at position 4 is changed to 2. But then the output also has another 2 in some positions. For instance, the first output line has 2 at index 4 and 10. Wait, let me check. First input line in Example 1's output is [8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,8,8]. So position 4 and 10 are 2. Wait, why?\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is replacing all 0s that are in certain positions. Let's see: in Example 0, the output changes the 9th element (index 8) to 2. But in the first example, the output changes the element at index 4 to 2. Then in Example 2, the outputs have 2 at index 1. For instance, the first input in Example 2 is [3,0,3,...], output is [3,2,3,...]. So index 1 is changed to 2. Also, in the third line of Example 2, which is all 0s, the output is all 2s. \n\nSo the pattern varies per example. But how? The examples are numbered 0, 1, 2. Let's see:\n\nExample 0: The output replaces the element at index 8 with 2. Also, if the entire list is all 0s, then all elements become 2.\n\nExample 1: The output replaces elements at index 4 and 10 with 2? Wait in the first output line, index 4 and 10 are 2. Wait the input for that line had 0s at those positions. So maybe in Example 1, every 0 that is in the positions where the index is divisible by some number is replaced with 2. Alternatively, maybe it's replacing every 0 that is in the fifth position (index 4) and the 11th (index 10) with 2.\n\nBut wait, looking at Example 1's input and output. Let's take the first input line:\n\nInput: [8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,8,8]\n\nOutput: [8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,8,8]\n\nSo the 0 at index 4 becomes 2, and the 0 at index 10 becomes 2, but the 0 at index 11 becomes 0. So why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe every 0 that is at a position where the index modulo 6 is 4? Because 4 and 10: 10-4=6. But 4 mod 6 is 4, 10 mod 6 is 4. So maybe indices where i mod 6 ==4 are replaced with 2. Let's check.\n\nIn the first example, for the first input, index 8 (which is 8 mod 6=2, which doesn't fit). Hmm, that's not matching. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the position where the replacement occurs depends on the example. For example 0, it's index 8. Example 1, index 4 and 10. Example 2, index 1.\n\nBut how is that determined? Maybe the position is determined by the example number. For example 0, the position is 8 (example 0 + 8 = 8?), example 1's positions are 4 and 10 (maybe example 1 * 6 -2=4?), not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the position is determined by the value in the input. For example, in Example 0, the input elements are 0 and 1. The output replaces the 9th element (index 8) with 2. In Example 1, the elements are 8 and 0, and the outputs have 2s at index 4 and 10. But why those indices?\n\nWait, looking back at the examples:\n\nIn Example 0, the output for each line (except the all-zero line) has a 2 at index 8. So for each line in example 0's input, the 9th element is changed to 2. Then the all-zero line is changed to all 2s.\n\nIn Example 1, each line's output has 2s at index 4 and 10. Let's check:\n\nTake the first input in Example 1: the original elements at index 4 and 10 are 0 and 0, and they become 2 and 2. The next input line's index 4 is 0, becomes 2. Index 10 is 0, becomes 2. Third line: index 4 is 0, becomes 2; index 10 is 0, becomes 2. Fourth line: index 4 is 0 \u2192 2, index 10 is 0 \u2192 2. Fifth line: index 4 \u2192 2, index 10 is 0 \u21922. Sixth line: index 4 is 0\u21922, index 10 is 0\u21922. Seventh line: index 4\u21920\u21922, index 10\u21920\u21922. Etc. So for Example 1, every 0 at positions 4 and 10 becomes 2. Also, the line in Example 1 that's all 8s except some 0s: the output has 2s at positions 4 and 10 if they were 0. For example, the input [0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8] becomes [0,8,0,8,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,8]. Wait, in the output, index 4 is 2 (input was 0), and index 10 is 2 (input was 0). So yes, any 0 at positions 4 or 10 becomes 2.\n\nBut why those positions? Maybe the positions are determined by the example number. Example 0: position 8. Example 1: positions 4 and 10. Example 2: position 1, and also when the entire list is 0s, it becomes all 2s.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the outputs have 2 at index 1. For instance, the first input line's index 1 is 0 \u2192 becomes 2. The second line's index 1 is 0 \u2192 2. The third line (all zeros) becomes all 2s. The fourth line's index 1 is 0 \u2192 2. So for Example 2, all 0s at index 1 are replaced with 2, and any line that's all 0s becomes all 2s.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each example, there's a specific set of indices where 0s are replaced with 2. The rest of the elements remain the same. Additionally, if the entire list is all 0s, it's replaced with all 2s.\n\nNow, looking at the test input. The test input's elements are 4 and 0. So the output should replace 0s in certain positions with 2, and all 0s lines become all 2s. But what are the positions here?\n\nThe examples were:\n\nExample 0: replace index 8.\n\nExample 1: replace indices 4 and 10.\n\nExample 2: replace index 1.\n\nHmm. Looking for a pattern in the example numbers and the indices replaced:\n\nExample 0: index 8.\n\nExample 1: indices 4 and 10.\n\nExample 2: index 1.\n\nWait, maybe the example number corresponds to the position in some way. For example, Example 0's index is 8, which is 8 (since 0-based). Example 1's indices are 4 and 10. But 4 and 10... Hmm, 4 is 1*4, 10 is 1*10? Not sure. Example 2's index is 1, which is 2*0 +1? Not sure. Maybe the positions are determined by 8 - example number* something. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions are determined by the example's number multiplied by a certain factor. For example:\n\nExample 0: 8 = 0 + 8.\n\nExample 1: 4 = 1*4, 10= 1*10.\n\nExample 2: 1=2*0.5. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions are based on the digits of the example number. For example, 0 is 8, 1 is 4 and 10 (but why?), 2 is 1. Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions are derived from the example's number in the training examples. For example, in Example 0, the position is 8 (the length of the input array minus something). Let's check the first input in Example 0: the input has 19 elements. 19-11=8? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each example, the positions where 0s are replaced are the positions where the index modulo some number equals a certain value. For Example 0, maybe index 8 (mod 9?), but 8 mod 9 is 8. Example 1: indices 4 and 10. 4 mod 6 is 4, 10 mod 6 is 4. So maybe mod 6, remainder 4. But 4 mod 6 is 4, 10 mod 6 is 4. So for Example 1, indices where i mod 6 =4 are replaced. For Example 0, maybe index 8 is i mod 9=8? Not sure.\n\nBut then how would this apply to the test case? The test input is not part of the examples, so we have to find a general rule.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: For each list, look for the first occurrence of 0, and replace it with 2. But that doesn't fit. For example, in Example 0's first input, the first 0 is at index 1, but the output replaces index 8. So that's not it.\n\nAnother possibility: the positions where 0s are replaced are the 9th element (index 8) for the first example (all 0s there?), but in the first example's input, the 9th element is 0, so it becomes 2. But in the second input of Example 0, the 9th element is 0 (input) and becomes 2. So that seems consistent. But in Example 1, why are two positions replaced?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions are determined by the length of the input. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0, the first input is 19 elements long. 19 elements, index 8 is the middle or something. 19//2 is 9.5, so index 9 is the middle. Not sure.\n\nExample 1's input lists have 14 elements. For example, the first input has 14 elements. The indices replaced are 4 and 10. 14-10=4. So maybe 4 and 10 are symmetric around the middle? The middle of 14 is index 6.5. 4 is 3.5 before, 10 is 3.5 after. So that could be a symmetry. So maybe the positions are mirrored around the middle.\n\nIn Example 2, the input lists are 15 elements long. The replaced index is 1. Why? Maybe because 15-1-1=13, but not sure.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent. So perhaps the pattern is that for each input list, the first occurrence of 0 is replaced with 2, and any subsequent 0s that are at positions which are multiples of the first 0's index plus some offset. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace the first 0 encountered in the list and then every nth 0 after that. But in Example 0, the first input has multiple 0s. The output has only one 2. So that can't be.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the test input. The test input's elements are 4 and 0. So we need to figure out which positions' 0s are replaced with 2. Let's look at the training examples to see if there's a pattern based on the numbers in the input.\n\nIn Example 0, the numbers are 0 and 1. The output replaces index 8's 0 with 2.\n\nIn Example 1, numbers are 0 and 8. Output replaces indices 4 and 10's 0s with 2.\n\nIn Example 2, numbers are 0 and 3. Output replaces index 1's 0s with 2.\n\nSo maybe the positions are determined by the non-zero number in the input. For example:\n\n- If the non-zero number is 1 (Example 0), then index 8 is replaced.\n- If the non-zero is 8 (Example 1), then indices 4 and 10 are replaced.\n- If the non-zero is 3 (Example 2), then index 1 is replaced.\n\nBut what's the relation between 1 and 8, 8 and 4/10, 3 and 1?\n\nHmm, maybe the positions are determined by the sum of the digits of the non-zero number. Wait, 1 is 1, sum is 1. 8 is 8, sum is 8. 3 is 3. That doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions are the non-zero number minus 1. For Example 0, non-zero is 1: 1-1=0. But replaced index is 8. Doesn't fit. Example 1, non-zero is 8: 8-1=7. Not 4 or 10.\n\nAlternatively, the positions could be based on the ASCII value of the non-zero number. But 1 is 49, 8 is 56, 3 is 51. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the positions are related to the example's index. For Example 0 (training example 0), the replaced index is 8. Example 1's replaced indices are 4 and 10. Example 2's replaced index is 1. If the example index is 0, replaced index is 8; example index 1, replaced indices are 4 and 10; example index 2, replaced index is 1. Maybe the replaced index is 8 - (example index * 4). For example, 8 -0*4=8. For example 1, 8 -1*4=4. Then, maybe for example 1, another position is added, like 4 +6=10. Then example 2 would be 8-2*4=0, but in example 2, the replaced index is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the example's index multiplied by some number. For example, 0: 8 = 0*... +8. 1: 4 and 10, which could be 1*4 and 1*10. 2: 1*1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions where 0s are replaced are the positions where the index modulo (non-zero number) equals a certain value. For Example 0, non-zero is 1. 8 mod 1 is 0. Not helpful. For Example 1, non-zero is 8. Let's see 4 mod 8=4, 10 mod8=2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced positions are the sum of the non-zero numbers in the list. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced positions are based on the first occurrence of the non-zero number. For example, in Example 0, the first element is 1, which is at index 0, but the replaced index is 8. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Looking for patterns in the test input. The test input's non-zero number is 4. So following the previous examples:\n\nExample 0: non-zero 1 \u2192 replaced index 8.\n\nExample 1: non-zero 8 \u2192 replaced indices 4 and 10.\n\nExample 2: non-zero 3 \u2192 replaced index 1.\n\nSo for non-zero 4, perhaps the replaced index is 2? Because 1\u21928, 8\u21924 and 10, 3\u21921. Maybe the replaced index is (non-zero number) divided by something. Like for 1: 8 = 1*8. 8: 4=8/2, 10=8+2. 3: 1=3-2. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the replaced index is 8 divided by the non-zero number. For example:\n\n1 \u2192 8/1=8.\n\n8 \u2192 8/2=4 and 8+2=10.\n\n3 \u2192 8/3 ~ 2.666, rounded to 1? Not really.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for non-zero number N, the replaced indices are 8, 8-N, 8+N. For example, N=1: 8. N=8: 8-8=0, 8+8=16. But in example 1, replaced indices are 4 and 10. 0 and 16 are not 4 and 10. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced indices are determined by the non-zero number minus 1. For N=1, 1-1=0, but replaced index is 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, think about the binary representation. 1 is 1, 8 is 1000, 3 is 11. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced indices are the digits of the non-zero number multiplied by something. For 8 (Example 1), 8 is a single digit, replaced indices 4 and 10. 8*0.5=4, 8+2=10. For 3 (Example 2), 3*0.333=1. So maybe replaced index is N/2 for even N, N// something. But 4 is even, so maybe 4/2=2. So for the test case, non-zero number is 4, replaced index would be 2? Or perhaps 4 and 2?\n\nLooking at the test input, let's see. The first line of the test input is [4,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,0,0]. If the pattern is to replace 0s at index 2 (if N=4), then in this list, index 2 is 4 (not 0), so no replacement. Hmm. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for N=4, the replaced indices are 8 - (4) =4? So index 4. Let's check the first line of the test input. At index 4, the value is 4, so no replacement. But there are 0s at indices 1,3,6,7, etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for N=4, the replaced indices are positions 8, like in Example 0. But the non-zero number was 1 there. So maybe that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced indices are calculated as (previous example replaced index) divided by 2. For example, example 0's replaced index 8. Example 1's replaced indices 4 and 10 (8/2=4, and 8+2=10). Example 2's replaced index 1 (4/4=1). So for N=4 (test case), maybe the replaced indices are 0.5, which is not possible. Not helpful.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look for another angle. In each example, the replaced positions are where 0s are changed to 2, and the rest are same. Also, if the entire list is 0s, replace all with 2.\n\nSo for the test input, which uses 4 and 0, we need to figure out which positions' 0s are replaced with 2. Looking at the examples:\n\nExample 0: non-zero 1 \u2192 replace index 8.\n\nExample 1: non-zero 8 \u2192 replace indices 4 and 10.\n\nExample 2: non-zero 3 \u2192 replace index 1.\n\nIs there a pattern between the non-zero number and the replaced indices?\n\nLet me list them:\n\nNon-zero | Replaced indices\n1 \u2192 8\n8 \u21924,10\n3 \u21921\n\nLooking for a pattern here. Maybe the replaced indices are (non-zero number -1) multiplied by something. For 1: 0 * 8 =0. No. For 8: 7* something =4 and 10. Not obvious. For 3: 2*0.5=1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replaced index is 8 / non-zero. 8/1=8. 8/8=1. But 8/3=2.666. Doesn't fit the example 2's index 1. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced index is the non-zero number's position in some list. For example, 1 is the first number, 8 is the eighth, 3 is third. But how would that relate to the replaced indices. For example, 1 \u2192 8, 8 \u21924 and 10 (but eighth position in what?), 3\u21921. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the non-zero number's digits added. For 8: 8 \u21928, so maybe 4 and 10 (8-4=4, 8+2=10). For 3: 3-2=1. For 1: 1+7=8. But this is just random guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced indices are the ones where the index is equal to the non-zero number minus 1. For example, 1-1=0 \u2192 index 0. But in example 0, replaced index is 8. So no.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the key is that in each example, the replaced indices are those where the index is equal to the number of letters in the word of the non-zero number. For example:\n\n- The non-zero number is 1, which is spelled \"one\" (3 letters). So replaced index is 3-1=2? Not matching example 0's 8.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Look at the sum of the non-zero numbers. For example, in example 0, non-zero is 1, and the replaced index is 8. 1*8=8. Example 1, non-zero is 8, replaced indices 4 and 10. 8*0.5=4, 8+2=10. Example 2, non-zero 3, replaced index 1. 3*0.333=1. So maybe for the test case's non-zero number 4, the replaced indices could be 2 (4*0.5) and 6 (4+2). But this is just a guess. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the test input's first line:\n\nInput: [4,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,0,0]\n\nIf we replace 0s at indices 2 and 6, but index 2 in this list is 4 (non-zero), so no. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that the replaced indices are the number of the example multiplied by something. But the test case is not part of the examples. So perhaps the pattern is that the replaced index is (the non-zero number's square root) or something. For example, 8 is 2^3, 3 is prime, 1 is 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the non-zero number's index in a list of primes. 1 is not a prime. 3 is the second prime (2,3), 8 is not a prime. So not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced indices are the non-zero number's factors. For 8, factors are 1,2,4,8. Not matching example 1's indices 4 and 10. \n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to see if there's another pattern. In each example, the replaced indices are the same across all input lines of that example. For example, in Example 0, all input lines have their 9th element (index 8) replaced with 2. In Example 1, all input lines have indices 4 and 10 replaced. In Example 2, index 1.\n\nSo the key is to determine, for the test input, which indices to replace. Since the test input uses 4 as the non-zero number, we need to find what indices are used for 4 based on the previous examples.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nNon-zero | Replaced indices\n1 \u2192 8\n8 \u21924,10\n3 \u21921\n\nLooking for a pattern between 1,8,3 and their replaced indices. Maybe the replaced indices are the digits of some function of the non-zero number. For example, 1 \u21928 (1+7=8), 8\u21924 and 10 (8-4=4, 8+2=10), 3 \u21921 (3-2=1). So perhaps for 4, it's 4+3=7 and 4-3=1, so indices 1 and 7. Or 4*2=8 and 4+6=10. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced indices are calculated as (non-zero number) multiplied by 2. For 1, 1*8=8. For 8, 8*0.5=4, 8*1.25=10. For 3, 3*0.333=1. Not making sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced indices are the sum of the digits of the non-zero number and some other number. For example, 1's sum is 1 \u21928? No.\n\nAlternatively, think of the non-zero number as the example's identifier. For example, example 0 uses 1 and 0. Maybe the replaced index is the example's number plus 8. Example 0: 0+8=8. Example 1:1+3=4, 1+9=10. Example 2:2-1=1. But why these numbers? Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, think of the replaced indices as positions related to the non-zero number in binary. For example, 1 in binary is 1, 8 is 1000, 3 is 11. But how to get the replaced indices from that. 1's binary is 1 \u2192 index 8 (binary 1000). 8's binary is 1000 \u2192 indices 4 (100) and 10 (1010). 3's binary is 11 \u2192 index 1 (1). That seems possible.\n\nSo for non-zero number 4, which is 100 in binary. The binary representation is 100. Then perhaps the replaced indices are 4 (100) and 8 (1000). But in example 0, 1 is 1 in binary and replaced index is 8 (1000). Example 1, 8 is 1000 in binary, replaced indices 4 (100) and 10 (1010). Example 2, 3 is 11 in binary, replaced index 1 (1). So for 4 (100), maybe the replaced indices are 4 (100) and 8 (1000) or other numbers derived from binary shifts.\n\nBut how does that fit? Let's see:\n\nNon-zero | Binary | Replaced indices\n1 \u2192 1 \u2192 8 (1000)\n8 \u2192 1000 \u21924 (100), 10 (1010)\n3 \u2192 11 \u21921 (1)\n4 \u2192 100 \u21924 (100), 8 (1000),  etc.\n\nSo for 4, maybe the replaced indices are 4 and 8.\n\nLooking at the test input's first line: [4,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,0,0]. The 0s are at indices 1,3,6,7,12,18,21,23,24. If the replaced indices are 4 and 8:\n\nIndex 4: value is 4, so no change. Index 8: value is 4, no change. So those positions are not 0. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced indices are the positions that are 1 in the binary representation of the non-zero number. For example, 1 is 1 \u2192 binary 1 \u2192 position 0 (but example 0's replaced index is 8). So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced indices are the positions where the binary digit is 1, but reversed. For example, 1 in binary is 1 (1 bit), so reversed positions (like index 0), but example 0 uses index 8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced indices are the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation plus one. For example, non-zero 8 is 1000, which has 3 trailing zeros \u2192 3+1=4. Which matches example 1's index 4. But example 1 has another index 10. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: For each non-zero number N, the replaced indices are N's factors. 8's factors are 1,2,4,8. But example 1's replaced indices are 4 and 10. 4 is a factor, 10 is not. 3's factors are 1,3. Example 2's replaced index is 1. So maybe the replaced indices are the factors of N. For N=4, factors are 1,2,4. So replaced indices could be 1,2,4.\n\nBut how to confirm this. Let's see:\n\nIn the test input's first line, the 0s are at indices 1,3,6,7, etc. If we replace 0s at indices 1,2,4. But in this line, index 2 is 4 (non-zero), so no replacement. Index 1 is 0 \u2192 replaced. Index 4 is 4 \u2192 no. So the replaced indices would be 1. But example 2 uses index 1 for N=3. So perhaps for N=4, the replaced index is 2 (since 4's factor is 2).\n\nBut this is speculative. It's possible that the pattern is that for each non-zero number N, the replaced indices are the factors of N (excluding N itself) plus some offset. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replaced indices are determined by the non-zero number's value modulo the example's number. But I don't see how.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for another angle. Let's consider the total number of 2s in the output for each example:\n\nIn Example 0, except for the all-zero line, each output has exactly one 2 (at index 8). The all-zero line has all 2s.\n\nIn Example 1, each output has two 2s (indices 4 and 10).\n\nIn Example 2, each output has one 2 (index 1), except the all-zero line which has all 2s.\n\nSo for the test input, which uses 4 as the non-zero number, maybe the number of 2s per line is two. So perhaps replaced indices are 2 and 8 (since 4 is 2 squared, 2 and 8). But how to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 2s is equal to the number of letters in the word of the non-zero number. For example, 1 (\"one\") has 3 letters \u2192 but example 0 has 1 two. No. 8 (\"eight\") has 5 letters \u2192 example 1 has two 2s. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the test input, since the non-zero number is 4, which is even, the replaced indices are even numbers. For example, indices 0,2,4, etc. But in example 1, non-zero 8 (even) has indices 4 and 10 (even). Example 0's index 8 is even. Example 2's index 1 is odd. So that pattern is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replaced indices are (non-zero number) divided by 2. For N=4, 4/2=2. So replaced index 2. Let's check the test input's first line. Index 2 is 4 \u2192 no replacement. But there are 0s elsewhere. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the training examples, the replaced indices are 8,4,10,1. These are all positions where the index is one less than a multiple of certain numbers. For example, 8+1=9=3^2, 4+1=5 (prime), 10+1=11 (prime), 1+1=2 (prime). But this is a stretch and not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the replaced indices as corresponding to the letters in the alphabet. For example, 1 \u2192 A (index 0?), 8 \u2192 H (index 7?), but example 0's replaced index is 8. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replaced indices are determined by the number of vowels in the spelling of the non-zero number. For example, \"one\" has two vowels, \"eight\" has two vowels, \"three\" has two vowels. But example 0's replaced index is 8, which is 8 vowels? No.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe the pattern is that for each example, the replaced indices are the ones where the index is equal to the example number multiplied by a certain factor. For example:\n\nExample 0: index 8 = 0* something +8.\n\nExample 1: indices 4=1*4, 10=1*10.\n\nExample 2: index 1=2*0.5.\n\nBut this is not consistent.\n\nAnother approach: Notice that in the first example, the replaced indices are 8. The second example's indices are 4 and 10. The third example's indices are 1. These are all 8, 4, 10, 1. If you write these numbers in sequence: 8,4,10,1. Perhaps these are the ASCII values for certain characters. 8 is backspace, 4 is EOT, 10 is new line, 1 is SOH. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 8 is the number of letters in \"example\", but that's not relevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of letters in the word of the non-zero number. For example, \"one\" (3 letters), \"eight\" (5 letters), \"three\" (5 letters). Not matching the replaced indices.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the digits of the example's index. Example 0: sum 0 \u2192 replaced index 8. Example 1: sum 1 \u2192 replaced indices 4 and 10. Example 2: sum 2 \u2192 replaced index 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replaced index is the product of the example's index and a certain number. For example, example 0: 0 * something +8=8. Example 1:1*4=4, 1*10=10. Example 2:2*0.5=1. Not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm not making progress, I'll make a guess based on the previous examples. The test input's non-zero number is 4. In Example 1, when the non-zero was 8 (which is 4*2), the replaced indices were 4 and 10. If we look for a pattern, perhaps for 4 (which is half of 8), the replaced indices are half of 4 and 10, which would be 2 and 5. But 2 and 5. Or maybe 4/2=2 and 10/2=5. So replaced indices 2 and 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for 4, the replaced indices are 8/2=4 and 4*2=8. So indices 4 and 8.\n\nLooking at the test input's first line: [4,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,0,0].\n\nIf we replace 0s at indices 4 and 8. Index 4 is 4 (no replacement), index 8 is 4 (no replacement). So that's no change, which doesn't help. But there are 0s at other indices. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for 4, the replaced indices are 2 and 6 (since 4+2=6). Let's check the first line's index 6: value is 0. So replacing it with 2. And index 2: value is 4, so no. So only index 6. But in the first line, there are multiple 0s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced indices are 4 and 8 for non-zero 4, but since those positions are 4 in the input, nothing changes, which would mean that the test output for the first line would have 0s replaced only if they're at positions 4 and 8, but in the first line, those positions are 4 and 8, which are 4s. So no replacement. But there are 0s elsewhere. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother possibility: The test case's non-zero number is 4, and the replaced indices are 8 - (4) =4. So index 4. But again, index 4 is 4 in the first line.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the test input's lines that are all 0s and replace them with all 2s. Then, for other lines, replace the 0s at certain indices.\n\nLooking at the test input, there are lines like [0,0,0,...,0] which should become all 2s. For other lines, perhaps the replaced indices are determined by the non-zero number 4. \n\nIn the examples, the replaced indices seem to be 8 for non-zero 1, 4 and 10 for non-zero 8, and 1 for non-zero 3. If we look for a pattern between the non-zero number and the replaced indices:\n\n- 1 \u2192 8 (1 +7)\n- 8 \u21924 (8/2) and 10 (8 +2)\n- 3 \u21921 (3-2)\n\nFor non-zero 4, maybe replaced indices are 4/2=2 and 4+2=6.\n\nSo for each 0 in the test input at indices 2 and 6, replace them with 2.\n\nLet's check the first line of the test input:\n\n[4,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,0,0]\n\nIndices 2 and 6:\n\nIndex 2: 4 \u2192 no change.\n\nIndex 6: 0 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nSo in the output, the 0 at index 6 is replaced with 2. But there are other 0s. So this would only change index 6.\n\nBut the training examples have multiple replaced indices. For example, example 1 replaced two indices per line. So for non-zero 4, perhaps there are two replaced indices. If indices 2 and 6, then:\n\nTest input's first line: index 6 is 0 \u2192 2. Any other 0s at 2? No. So output would have 2 at index 6. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to confirm. Looking at Example 2, non-zero 3, replaced index 1. So perhaps for even non-zero numbers, replaced indices are even, and for odd, odd. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for even non-zero numbers like 4, the replaced indices are even, and for odd, odd. Example 0: non-zero 1 (odd), replaced index 8 (even). Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced indices are (non-zero number) divided by 2 and (non-zero number) multiplied by 2. For non-zero 4: 4/2=2, 4*2=8. So indices 2 and 8.\n\nIn the first line of the test input, index 2 is 4 \u2192 no change. Index 8 is 4 \u2192 no change. So no replacements. But there are 0s elsewhere. This doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, perhaps the best guess is that for the test input, the replaced indices are the same as the example number's replaced indices. But since the test input isn't part of the examples, this approach won't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replaced index is determined by the non-zero number's position in the examples. For example, 1 is the first non-zero number (example 0), replaced index 8. 8 is the second (example 1), replaced indices 4 and 10. 3 is third (example 2), replaced index 1. So for 4 (new non-zero), perhaps replaced indices are 0 and 2 (the fourth example). But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replaced index is the non-zero number minus 1. For 4-1=3. So replaced index 3. Let's check the first line. Index 3 is 0 \u2192 becomes 2. So the first line's output would have a 2 at index 3. But what about other lines. For example, the second line of the test input:\n\n[4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,0,0]\n\nIf replaced index is 3, then index 3 is 0 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nBut this is speculative. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nGiven that the time is limited, I'll make a guess based on the previous examples. The test input's non-zero number is 4, and in the examples, the replaced indices for 1,8,3 are 8,4,10,1. Perhaps for 4, the replaced indices are 2 (since 4 is 2 squared). So every 0 at index 2 is replaced with 2. Additionally, if the entire list is 0s, replaced with all 2s.\n\nLooking at the test input's first line, the 0s are at indices 1,3,6,7,12,18,21,23,24. None are at index 2. So no replacement. But this would mean no 2s in the output, except for the all-zero lines.\n\nAlternatively, for non-zero 4, the replaced indices are 4 and 8. But in the test input's first line, those indices are 4 and 8, which are 4 and 4 \u2192 no replacement.\n\nThis is not working. I think I'm stuck and need to make a educated guess based on the examples. Since the test input uses 4, and in example 1 (non-zero 8), the replaced indices are 4 and 10. Maybe for 4, the replaced indices are 2 and 5 (half of 4 and 10). \n\nAlternatively, considering that example 0's replaced index is 8, example 1's 4 and 10, example 2's 1, the replaced indices seem to be decreasing as the example number increases. So perhaps for the test input's non-zero 4, the replaced indices are 2 and 6. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, I'll have to proceed with a possible answer. Given that in Example 0, the replaced index is 8, Example 1's indices are 4 and 10 (which are 8-4=4, 8+2=10), and Example 2's index 1 (4-3=1), perhaps for 4, the replaced indices are 8-4=4 and 8+4=12. So indices 4 and 12. \n\nLooking at the first line of the test input, index 4 is 4 (no change), index 12 is 0 \u2192 becomes 2. So the output would have a 2 at index 12. But there are other 0s. \n\nAnother line in the test input: [0,0,0,...0] would become all 2s.\n\nBut since this is taking too long and I need to provide an answer, I'll assume that for the test input, the replaced indices are 4 and 12. Therefore, in each line of the test input, any 0s at indices 4 and 12 are replaced with 2, and all 0s lines become all 2s.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples and then apply that pattern to the test input. Let me start by looking at the examples provided to see if I can spot any obvious changes.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input lists consist of 0s and 1s, and the output lists have some 2s introduced. Looking at the first input list:\n\nInput: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nOutput: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nI notice that the 9th element (index 8, since lists are zero-based) changes from 0 to 2. Let me check the other examples. In the second input of Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nOutput: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nAgain, the 9th element (index 8) is changed to 2. The same pattern holds for all other input-output pairs in Example 0. Except for the 9th input list, which was all zeros. The output for that one is all 2s. So, in that case, every element is 2. Wait, looking at that input: [0,0,...0], output is all 2s. So maybe the rule is: if the entire list is zeros, replace all with 2. Otherwise, replace the 9th element (index 8) with 2, and leave others as is? Let me check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input lists have 8s and 0s. The outputs have 2s inserted. Let's take the first input in Example 1:\n\nInput: [8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,8,8]\nOutput: [8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,8,8]\n\nHere, the 5th element (index 4) and the 11th (index 10) are replaced with 2. Wait, in the input, index 4 is 0, and in output it's 2. Similarly, index 10 was 0 and becomes 2. Hmm, but wait in the output, index 4 is 2. So maybe the rule is different here. Let me compare all inputs and outputs in Example 1.\n\nLooking at the first input's output: positions 4 and 10 are 2. Original inputs had 0s there. But in the second input of Example 1:\n\nInput: [0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8]\nOutput: [0,8,0,0,2,0,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8]\n\nHere, the 5th element (index 4) was 0 and becomes 2. The 11th element (index 10) was 0 and becomes 2. Similarly, in other inputs, wherever there's a 0 at index 4 or 10, it becomes 2. Wait, but in the third input of Example 1:\n\nInput: [8,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,8,8]\nOutput: [8,8,0,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,8,8]\n\nAgain, index 4 and 10 (values 0) become 2. So the pattern here seems to be that in each list, the 5th and 11th elements (indices 4 and 10) are replaced with 2 if they were 0. Wait, but in Example 0, the 9th element (index 8) was replaced. So perhaps each example has a different position where 0s are replaced with 2. Or maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the test input in Example 0, the 9th element (index 8) is replaced with 2. But in Example 1, the positions are 4 and 10. Hmm. Let's check the lengths of the lists. In Example 0, each input list has 19 elements. The 9th element is index 8. But in Example 1, the lists have 14 elements. The outputs in Example 1 have 2s at index 4 and 10. Let's see: 14 elements, so indexes 0-13. So positions 5 and 11 (if counting from 1) are index 4 and 10. Maybe the pattern is that in each list, the middle element(s) are replaced. Wait, but 19 elements would have a middle at index 9. But in Example 0, the replacement is at index 8. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions where 0s are replaced with 2 are determined by the length of the list. Let's calculate:\n\nIn Example 0, each list has 19 elements. The output replaces the 9th element (index 8). 19 elements: so if it's the middle index, 19//2=9 (index 9). But in the output, index 8 is replaced. Wait, perhaps the position is determined by the length of the list. Let's check:\n\nFor Example 0: list length 19. The replaced index is 8. Let's see 19-1=18 (max index). 18/2=9. So maybe it's (length-1)/2. For 19 elements, (19-1)/2=9. But index 8 is being replaced, which is 9-1. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, let's check the other examples. In Example 1, each list has 14 elements. So length 14. The replaced positions are 4 and 10. Let's see: 14-1=13. So midpoints could be at 6.5, so indices 6 and 7. But in the output, 4 and 10 are replaced. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the number of positions where 0s are replaced with 2 is related to the list's length. For example, in Example 0, 19 elements: maybe every 0 at position (length-1) - i or something. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that in each list, the first occurrence of 0 is replaced with 2, and if the entire list is all 0s, then replace all with 2. Wait, let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's first input, the input has a 0 at index 8 (the first 0 is at index 1, but the replaced 0 is at index 8. So that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the 9th element (index 8) is always replaced. For Example 0's input lists, regardless of the value, that position is set to 2. Let me check:\n\nFirst input of Example 0: original at index 8 is 0 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nSecond input of Example 0: index 8 is 0 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nThird input: index 8 is 0 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nFourth input: index 8 is 0 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nFifth input: index 8 is 0 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nSixth input: index 8 is 0 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nSeventh input: index 8 is 0 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nEighth input: index 8 is 0 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nThen the ninth input is all zeros \u2192 output is all 2s.\n\nTenth input: index 8 is 0 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nEleventh input: index 8 is 0 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nTwelfth input: index 8 is 0 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nSo in all non-all-zero lists, the 9th element (index 8) is replaced with 2. The all-zero list becomes all 2s. So for lists of length 19, the rule is replace the 9th element (index 8) with 2, unless all elements are 0, in which case replace all with 2.\n\nNow looking at Example 1: the lists are of length 14. Let's see the first input:\n\nInput: [8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,8,8]\n\nOutput: [8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,8,8]\n\nHere, the 5th and 11th elements (indices 4 and 10) are replaced with 2. The input had 0s at those positions. Let's check the other inputs in Example 1:\n\nSecond input in Example 1:\n\nInput: [0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8]\n\nOutput: [0,8,0,0,2,0,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8]\n\nAgain, indices 4 and 10 (originally 0s) become 2. Third input:\n\nInput: [8,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,8,8]\n\nOutput: [8,8,0,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,8,8]\n\nSame pattern. So for lists of length 14, the positions 4 and 10 (indices 4 and 10) are replaced with 2. The all-zero list in Example 0 becomes all 2s, but in Example 1, there's no all-zero input. But in Example 2, let's check.\n\nIn Example 2, the input lists have elements 3 and 0. The output lists have 2s. Let's take the first input:\n\nInput: [3,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3]\n\nOutput: [3,2,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3]\n\nHere, index 1 (0) becomes 2. Another input:\n\nThird input in Example 2 is all zeros, and output is all 2s.\n\nAnother input in Example 2:\n\nInput: [3,0,3,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nOutput: [3,2,3,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,0,0,3,0]\n\nAgain, index 1 (0) becomes 2. So for Example 2, lists of length 15 have the second element (index 1) replaced with 2. The all-zero list becomes all 2s.\n\nSo putting this together, the pattern seems to be:\n\n- For each input list, if all elements are 0, replace all with 2.\n\n- Otherwise, replace the element at a specific index with 2. The specific index depends on the length of the list.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nIn Example 0, list length 19: replace index 8.\n\nIn Example 1, list length 14: replace indices 4 and 10.\n\nIn Example 2, list length 15: replace index 1.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem to follow a single pattern. So perhaps the position depends on the list length in a certain way.\n\nLet me check the list lengths and the replaced indices:\n\nExample 0: length 19 \u2192 index 8.\n\n19-1=18. Half of 18 is 9. So index 9? But they replaced index 8. Hmm.\n\nExample 1: length 14 \u2192 indices 4 and 10. 14 elements, indices 0-13. 13/2=6.5. So middle indices are 6 and 7. But in the example, they replaced indices 4 and 10. Not sure.\n\nExample 2: length 15 \u2192 index 1. 15-1=14. 14/2=7, so index 7. But replaced index 1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the position is the (length of the list - 1) divided by 2. For Example 0, (19-1)/2=9. But replaced index 8. Not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the position is determined by the number of elements. For example, in Example 0 (19 elements), perhaps the 9th element (index 8) is the middle. For 19 elements, the middle is at position 9 (index 8 if zero-based). Wait, 19 elements: 0 to 18. The middle is the 9th element (index 9?), wait no. Let's see: the middle of 19 elements is the 10th element (indices 0-18, so 10th element is index 9). But in Example 0, index 8 was replaced. Hmm. That doesn't fit. Maybe it's the 9th element (index 8) regardless. But why in Example 1, the replaced indices are 4 and 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's replacing every occurrence of 0 at specific positions. But in Example 0, only index 8 is replaced. In Example 1, indices 4 and 10. In Example 2, index 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the positions are determined by the first and last occurrence of 0. But that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's first input:\n\nOriginal list: [8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,8,8]\n\nThe replaced positions are indices 4 and 10. Both were 0. So maybe in lists with multiple 0s, replace certain positions. But in Example 0, even if there are other 0s, only index 8 is replaced. For example, in the first input of Example 0, there are multiple 0s, but only index 8 becomes 2.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for each list, replace the 0 at a specific position (depending on the list's length) with 2. If that specific position is already non-zero, leave it as is. Except for all-zero lists, which are replaced entirely.\n\nSo how to determine the position based on the list's length.\n\nLooking at the three examples:\n\nExample 0: list length 19 \u2192 index 8.\n\nExample 1: list length 14 \u2192 indices 4 and 10.\n\nExample 2: list length 15 \u2192 index 1.\n\nHmm. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Let's calculate for each length:\n\nFor 19: index 8. 19-11=8. 11 is the first example number. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the index is (length - 3)/2. For 19: (19-3)/2 = 8. That gives index 8.\n\nFor Example 1, length 14: (14-3)/2=5.5, which is not integer. Doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, index = length - 11. For 19: 19-11=8. For 14: 14-11=3. Doesn't fit Example 1's indices 4 and 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the 8th index for 19 elements, which is (19-1)/2 - 0.5? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the index is determined by taking the length modulo some number. For example, 19 mod 11 =8. 14 mod 10=4. But 14 mod 10 is 4, but in Example 1, they replaced indices 4 and 10. Hmm.\n\nWait, 10 is 14 mod 4? 14 mod 4= 2. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for even-length lists, replace two indices, and for odd-length, replace one. Example 0 has odd length (19), replaced one index. Example 1 has even length (14), replaced two indices. Example 2 has odd length (15), replaced one index. That makes sense. So perhaps for even-length lists, replace the (n/2 -1) and (n/2 +1) indices? Or something like that.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample 0: length 19 (odd). Middle index is (19-1)/2=9. So index 9. But in the output, index 8 is replaced. So maybe it's the middle index minus 1. 9-1=8. So replaced index 8.\n\nExample 1: length 14 (even). Middle indices are 6 and 7 (since 14/2=7, so indices 6 and 7). But the replaced indices are 4 and 10. So 4 and 10. Hmm, 4 is 6-2, 10 is 7+3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for even-length lists, perhaps the indices are (length/2 -3) and (length/2 +3). For 14: 14/2=7. 7-3=4, 7+3=10. Yes! So indices 4 and 10. That matches Example 1's replaced positions.\n\nFor Example 0 (odd length 19): middle index is 9 (since (19-1)/2=9). So replaced index would be 9-1=8. That fits.\n\nExample 2: length 15 (odd). Middle index is (15-1)/2=7. So replaced index would be 7-6=1? Not sure. Or middle index minus 6: 7-6=1. That fits. Because in Example 2, the replaced index is 1.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n- For a list of odd length n: replace the element at position (middle index) - k, where k is some value. For Example 0, k=1. For Example 2, k=6.\n\nBut that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe for odd lengths, the replaced index is middle index minus (length modulo something). Let's see:\n\nExample 0: length 19. Middle index 9. 19 mod 10=9. 9-1=8.\n\nExample 2: length 15. Middle index 7. 15 mod 8=7. 7-6=1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replaced index is (length of the list) divided by 2, rounded down, minus some number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replaced index is determined by the following formula:\n\nFor even-length lists: replaced indices are (length/2 -3) and (length/2 +3 -1) ?\n\nWait, for even length 14: length/2=7. 7-3=4, 7+3-1=9. But in Example 1, replaced indices are 4 and 10. Hmm, 7+3=10. Oh, yes. So 7-3=4 and 7+3=10. So for even-length lists, replaced indices are (middle -3) and (middle +3), where middle is length/2.\n\nFor odd-length lists, the replaced index is (middle -3), where middle is (length-1)/2.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample 0: length 19. middle is (19-1)/2=9. 9-3=6. No, in Example 0, the replaced index is 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe it's (middle index) - 1 for odd lengths. For Example 0's middle index 9, 9-1=8. Which matches. For Example 2's middle index 7 (15-1=14/2=7), 7-6=1. So that doesn't fit. Wait, but Example 2's replaced index is 1. So this doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for odd lengths, the replaced index is (length modulo 10). For Example 0: 19 mod 10=9. But index 8 was replaced. 9-1=8. Example 2: 15 mod 10=5. 5-4=1. Maybe. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replaced index is determined by the example number. Wait, the examples are labeled Example 0, Example 1, Example 2. In Example 0, replaced index 8 (for length 19). 0+8=8. Not sure. Example 1, replaced indices 4 and 10 (for length 14). 1+3=4, 1+9=10. Not sure.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's think differently. Let's look at the test input and see if we can find a pattern based on the examples.\n\nThe test input lists vary in length. Let's check the first list in the test input:\n\n[4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nThis has 25 elements. So length 25. Following the pattern from the examples:\n\nFor odd-length lists, replace a specific index. For even-length, replace two.\n\nBut according to the previous examples, for odd lengths:\n\nExample 0 (19 elements): replaced index 8.\n\nExample 2 (15 elements): replaced index 1.\n\nSo perhaps for a 25-element list, the replaced index would be 8? Or another index.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replaced index is the (length -1) // 2 -1. For 25, (25-1)/2=12. 12-1=11. So index 11.\n\nBut that's just a guess. Let's look at the test input and see.\n\nWait, perhaps the replaced index is the same as the example number's position. For instance, the training examples have three examples, each with a different replaced position. But the test input is separate, so we need to find a general rule.\n\nAnother approach: looking at all examples:\n\nFor each example, the replaced positions are:\n\nExample 0:\n\nLength 19 \u2192 index 8.\n\nExample 1:\n\nLength 14 \u2192 indices 4 and 10.\n\nExample 2:\n\nLength 15 \u2192 index 1.\n\nBut why those indices?\n\nWait, let's look at the elements at those positions in the input. In Example 0, index 8 is 0 in all non-all-zero lists. In Example 1, indices 4 and 10 are 0 in the input. So the transformation replaces 0s at those specific positions with 2. So the pattern might be: for each list, replace every 0 at a specific position (or positions) with 2, and if the entire list is 0s, replace all with 2.\n\nThe positions to replace are determined by the list's length.\n\nIn Example 0 (length 19): replace index 8.\n\nIn Example 1 (length 14): replace indices 4 and 10.\n\nIn Example 2 (length 15): replace index 1.\n\nHmm. What's special about these indices?\n\nFor length 19: 19 is a prime number. 19-11=8.\n\nFor length 14: 14 is even. 14/2=7. 7-3=4 and 7+3=10.\n\nAh! That seems to fit. For even-length lists, replaced indices are middle index (length/2) minus 3 and plus 3. For example:\n\nExample 1, length 14: middle indices are 6 and 7 (since even). But 14/2=7. So middle is at index 6 and 7. So 7-3=4 and 7+3=10. Those are the replaced indices.\n\nFor odd-length lists:\n\nExample 0, length 19: middle index is 9. 9-1=8. So replaced index 8.\n\nExample 2, length 15: middle index is 7. 7-6=1. Wait, 7-6=1. Not sure why subtract 6. Alternatively, maybe for odd-length lists, the replaced index is (middle index) minus (some function of the length). For example, 19 is a prime number, but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, for odd-length lists, the replaced index is the middle index minus 1. For Example 0's middle index 9, 9-1=8. For Example 2's middle index 7, 7-6=1. Hmm, that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for odd-length lists, the replaced index is the middle index minus (length modulo 10). For Example 0: length 19, mod 10 is 9. Middle index 9. 9-9=0. No. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replaced index is determined by a certain pattern. For Example 0, 19 elements: index 8. Which is the 9th element. Why 9? 19-10=9. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replaced positions are chosen based on the example's number. But that doesn't make sense for the test input.\n\nLet's try to find a formula that works for all examples.\n\nFor even-length lists:\n\nReplaced indices = middle -3 and middle +3. For example, in Example 1 (length 14, middle at 7), 7-3=4 and 7+3=10.\n\nFor odd-length lists:\n\nReplaced index = middle - (some number). For Example 0 (middle 9), replaced 8 \u2192 9-1=8. For Example 2 (middle 7), replaced 1 \u2192 7-6=1.\n\nHmm, not a clear pattern. Maybe for odd-length lists, replaced index is middle - (length // 10). For Example 0, 19//10=1 \u2192 9-1=8. For Example 2, 15//10=1 \u2192 7-1=6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for odd-length lists, replaced index is middle - (number of letters in the word \"example\" or something). Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: look for the test input lists. The first test input list has length 25 (odd). If the replaced index is middle -1. Middle index is (25-1)/2=12. So 12-1=11. So replace index 11.\n\nOriginal list:\n\n[4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nIndex 11 is 4. But in the input, index 11 is 4. So if the replaced index is 11, but the original value is 4 (not 0), then it would stay 4. But in the examples, only 0s at specific positions are replaced. So perhaps for odd-length lists, the replaced index is middle -1. For length 25, middle index 12. Replaced index 12-1=11. But the value there is 4. So no change. But maybe in some other list, index 11 is 0. Let's check other test input lists.\n\nAnother test input list:\n\n[0,0,...0], which should become all 2s.\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,0,0]\n\nThis is length 25. Middle index 12. Replaced index 11. If index 11 is 4, no change. But perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replaced index for odd-length lists is the middle index. For example, in Example 0, middle index 9. But in the output, index 8 is replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's recap:\n\nTraining examples:\n\n- Example 0: lists of length 19, replace index 8 (which is the 9th element) with 2 if it's 0.\n\n- Example 1: lists of length 14, replace indices 4 and 10 with 2 if they are 0.\n\n- Example 2: lists of length 15, replace index 1 with 2 if it's 0.\n\n- All-zero lists become all 2s.\n\nThe question is, what determines the replaced index based on the list length.\n\nAlternative approach: for each example, the replaced index is the example number multiplied by some factor. Example 0: replaced index 8. Example 1: indices 4 and 10 (example 1, 4+6=10). Example 2: index 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replaced indices are determined by the digits of pi or some other sequence. But that's unlikely.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the test input. The first test input list is length 25. If the pattern for even and odd lengths is similar to the examples:\n\nFor even-length lists: replaced indices are middle \u00b13.\n\nFor odd-length lists: replaced index is middle -1.\n\nLet's check:\n\nFor odd-length 25: middle index (25-1)/2=12. Middle index 12. Replaced index 12-1=11. So index 11. Let's look at the first test input list:\n\nIndexes 0-24.\n\nIndex 11 in the first test input list is 4 (original element), so if the rule is to replace 0s at index 11 with 2, but this element is 4, then it remains 4. So no change there. But perhaps there's another 0 at index 11 in other test lists.\n\nLooking at another test list:\n\n[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nThis has length 25. Index 11 is 4 (element is 4), so no change. But if the replaced index is different, like index 8 or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replaced index for odd-length lists is determined by the length modulo something. For example:\n\nlength 19 \u2192 19 mod 10=9 \u2192 index 9-1=8.\n\nlength 15 \u2192 15 mod 10=5 \u2192 index 5-4=1.\n\nBut why subtract 4?\n\nAlternatively, the replaced index is (length -1) // 2 - k, where k is a certain value.\n\nFor length 19: (19-1)/2=9 \u2192 9-1=8.\n\nFor length 15: (15-1)/2=7 \u21927-6=1.\n\nBut why subtract 1 for 19 and 6 for 15? Not clear.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the replaced index is the same as the example's number. Example 0 \u2192 index 0, but no. Example 0 has index 8. Example 1 has indices 4 and 10 (example number 1). Not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced positions are determined by the number of letters in the word representing the example's number. Like \"zero\" has four letters, but example 0's index is 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replaced positions are the digits of the example's number multiplied by the list length. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's think differently. Maybe the pattern is that for each list, the position to replace is determined by the sum of the elements. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replaced positions are those where the element is 0 and its position is divisible by a certain number. For Example 0, index 8: 8 is divisible by 8. For Example 1, indices 4 and 10: 4 is divisible by 4, 10 is divisible by 5. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the positions are prime numbers. 8 is not prime. 4 and 10 are not primes. 1 is not a prime.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the test input's first list. The input is:\n\n[4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nLength 25. The output should have 2 in certain positions. Based on the examples, maybe the replaced index is 8 (for length 19), but that's different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced index is the first occurrence of 0. But in the first test list, the first 0 is at index 1. But in the examples, the replaced index wasn't necessarily the first 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced index is the last occurrence of 0. In the first test list, the last 0 is at index 24. But replacing that would make sense? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of zeros in the list determines the replaced positions. But not sure.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the replaced positions are those where the index is one less than a multiple of 5. For Example 0, index 8 is 9-1=8 (9 is a multiple of 9). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the replaced indices in the examples:\n\nExample 0: 8 \u2192 8+1=9, which is 9th element.\n\nExample 1: 4 and 10 \u2192 5th and 11th elements. 5 and 11 are primes.\n\nExample 2: 1 \u2192 2nd element. 2 is a prime.\n\nBut why would this be the case?\n\nIf that's the pattern, for the test input's first list (length 25), the replaced indices would be primes. 25th element's primes up to 25 are 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23. So perhaps replace indices 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 16, 18, 22 (since indices are zero-based). But this seems too many and not matching the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced index is the second prime number's position. For length 25, the second prime is 3 (indices 0-24: primes are 2,3,5,...) \u2192 index 2. But in Example 0, replaced index 8, which is not a prime.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, perhaps I should try to find the pattern by assuming that for each list, the position to replace is determined by the length of the list as follows:\n\n- For even-length lists: replace indices (length/2 -3) and (length/2 +3 -1). For length 14: 14/2=7 \u2192 7-3=4, 7+3=10.\n\n- For odd-length lists: replace index (length-1)/2 -1. For length 19: (19-1)/2=9 \u2192 9-1=8. For length 15: (15-1)/2=7 \u21927-6=1. Wait, why 7-6=1? That doesn't fit. But maybe for odd-length lists, it's (length-1)/2 - (length mod 5). For 19: 19 mod 5=4. 9-4=5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, for odd-length lists, replaced index is (length-1)/2 - (number of vowels in the word \"example\"). Not helpful.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to hypothesize that for even-length lists, the replaced indices are middle \u00b13, and for odd-length lists, replaced index is middle-1.\n\nLet's apply this to the test input lists.\n\nFirst test list: length 25 (odd). Middle index is (25-1)/2=12. So replaced index is 12-1=11. Check the element at index 11: it's 4. So if the element was 0, replace with 2. But it's 4, so no change. So the output for this list would be the same as input, except if there's a 0 at index 11. Let's check another test list.\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis is all zeros. According to the pattern, replace all with 2s.\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nLength 25. Middle index 12. Replaced index 11. Element at 11 is 4 \u2192 no change. But if there are other 0s at index 11 in other lists, those would be replaced.\n\nWait, perhaps in the test input, some lists have 0s at the calculated positions. For example, a list of length 25, if the replaced index is 11, and there's a 0 there, then it becomes 2. Otherwise, remains as is.\n\nLooking at another test list:\n\n[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nIndex 11 is 4. No change.\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4]\n\nLength 25. Index 11 is 4. No change.\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nIndex 11 is 4. No change.\n\nHmm. It seems like few test lists have 0s at the calculated replaced positions, so the output might have few 2s. But in the training examples, even if the replaced position wasn't 0, it was left as is. For example, in Example 2, some inputs had 3 at index 1, so it remained 3 in the output.\n\nBut the test input's first list has a 0 at index 8? Let me check the first test input list:\n\nIndices 0-24:\n\n0:4, 1:0, 2:4, 3:0, 4:4, 5:4, 6:0,7:0,8:4,9:4,10:4,11:4,12:0,13:4,14:4,15:4,16:4,17:4,18:0,19:4,20:4,21:0,22:4,23:0,24:0.\n\nIndex 11 is 4. So no change. But perhaps the replaced index for length 25 is different. Maybe for odd-length lists, the replaced index is (length-1)/2 -3. For length 25: 12-3=9. Index 9. In the first test list, index 9 is 4. No change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for odd-length lists, replaced index is (length-1)/2 -4. 12-4=8. Index 8 is 4 \u2192 no change.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Perhaps I need to consider that the pattern is not based on the list's length, but rather the positions of 0s in the list. For example, replace the 0s at positions that are multiples of a certain number. \n\nIn Example 0, index 8 (which is 8) is a multiple of 8.\n\nIn Example 1, indices 4 and 10: 4 is a multiple of 4, 10 is a multiple of 5. \n\nIn Example 2, index 1 is not a multiple of any particular number. \n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced positions are those where the index is one less than a multiple of a certain number. For Example 0, index 8 is 9-1=9, which is a multiple of 3. Example 1, index 4 is 5-1=5 (prime), 10 is 11-1=10 (not sure). Not helpful.\n\nGiven that I can't find a clear mathematical pattern, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the following:\n\nIn each example, the replaced positions are those that are the 9th, 5th and 11th, or 2nd elements. This might correspond to the digits in the example number.\n\nExample 0: 9th element (digit 0 is 0, and 9th element is index 8).\n\nExample 1: 5th and 11th elements (digits 1, but not sure).\n\nExample 2: 2nd element (digit 2 in example number 2).\n\nSo for the test input, perhaps the example number is 3 (but there's no example 3), but the test input is separate. So perhaps the pattern is:\n\nReplace the (example number + 8)th element. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the replaced positions are the same as the example number's digit. For example, in Example 0, replace index 0+8=8. Example 1, replace indices 1+3=4 and 1+9=10. Example 2, replace index 2-1=1.\n\nBut this is a stretch.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think the correct pattern is:\n\nFor each list, if all elements are 0 \u2192 replace all with 2.\n\nOtherwise, replace the 0 at a specific position with 2. The specific position is determined as follows:\n\n- For lists with odd length: replace the ( (length -1)/2 -1 )th index.\n\n- For even length: replace the (length/2 -3) and (length/2 +3) indices.\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample 0: length 19 (odd). (19-1)/2=9. 9-1=8. Correct.\n\nExample 1: length 14 (even). 14/2=7. 7-3=4, 7+3=10. Correct.\n\nExample 2: length 15 (odd). (15-1)/2=7. 7-1=6. But in Example 2, the replaced index is 1. So this doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, Example 2's replaced index is 1. So maybe for some reason, the formula is (length -1)/2 -6 for length 15. 7-6=1. That works for Example 2, but why subtract 6?\n\nAlternatively, the formula could be (length of the list) minus 14. For Example 0: 19-14=5. Not matching index 8. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replaced index is (example number * something). For Example 0 (0), index 8. Example 1 (1), indices 4 and 10. Example 2 (2), index 1.\n\nBut there's no obvious relation.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed to the test input and apply the pattern I observed in the examples, which is:\n\nFor each list:\n\n- If all elements are 0 \u2192 replace with all 2s.\n\n- Else, replace 0s at certain positions with 2. The positions depend on the list's length.\n\nLooking at the test input lists, I need to determine which positions to replace. Since the test input's lists vary in length, I need to compute the replaced indices based on their length.\n\nFor example, take the first test input list with length 25 (odd). According to the pattern in Example 0 (odd length), the replaced index is (length-1)/2 -1 = (25-1)/2 -1 =12-1=11. So replace index 11. Let's check the element at index 11 in this list: it's 4. So no change. So the output would have 2 only if that index is 0.\n\nAnother test list with all zeros would become all 2s.\n\nAnother test list with even length, say 24, would have replaced indices at (24/2 -3) =9 and (24/2 +3)=15. So indices 9 and 15. Replace 0s there with 2.\n\nBut I need to apply this to each list in the test input.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact pattern for each length, this is guesswork. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for even-length lists, replaced indices are middle-3 and middle+3, and for odd-length lists, replaced index is middle-1.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nLet's process each test list:\n\nFirst test list:\n\n[4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nLength 25 (odd). Middle index 12. Replaced index 12-1=11. Element at 11 is 4 \u2192 no change. So output is the same as input except for any 0 at index 11. But in this list, index 11 is 4. So output remains the same. But wait, the first example's all-zero list becomes all 2s. Any other lists with all zeros would be replaced.\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[0,0,...0] (length 25) \u2192 all 2s.\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,0,0]\n\nLength 25. Replaced index 11 is 4 \u2192 no change.\n\nAnother list:\n\n[4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0]\n\nLength 25. Index 11 is 4 \u2192 no change.\n\nAnother list:\n\n[4,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4]\n\nLength 25. Index 11 is 4 \u2192 no change.\n\nAnother list:\n\n[4,4,4,0,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,4]\n\nLength 25. Index 11 is 4 \u2192 no change.\n\nSo, for most lists, the replaced index doesn't have a 0, so no change. The only lists that would change are those with a 0 at the calculated replaced index or all zeros.\n\nLooking at the test input, there are a few all-zero lists. For example, the third test input list is all zeros:\n\n[0,0,...,0] \u2192 becomes all 2s.\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[0,0,...,0] (again) \u2192 all 2s.\n\nAnother list:\n\n[4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,0,0]\n\nIndex 6 is 0. But according to the hypothesis, only index 11 is replaced. So no change here.\n\nGiven this, the final answer for the test input would be to replace the all-zero lists with all 2s, and for other lists, replace 0s at specific indices (based on their length) with 2. However, since most test lists don't have 0s at those positions, the output would be the same as input except for the all-zero lists and any lists where the specific index has a 0.\n\nBut I need to determine the correct replaced indices for each list in the test input.\n\nGiven that I can't find a solid pattern and time is limited, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each list, the replaced index is the middle index minus 1 for odd lengths, and middle \u00b13 for even lengths. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFor example, one of the test lists has even length:\n\nLooking for even-length lists in the test input:\n\nFourth test list:\n\n[4,4,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4]\n\nLength 25 (odd). No.\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[4,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]\n\nLength 25 (odd).\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4]\n\nLength 25 (odd).\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4]\n\nLength 25 (odd).\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[4,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4]\n\nLength 25 (odd).\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4,0,4]\n\nLength 25 (odd).\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[0,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,0,4,4,0]\n\nLength 25 (odd).\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[0,4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4]\n\nLength 25 (odd).\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[4,4,4,0,4,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0]\n\nLength 25 (odd).\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[4,4,0,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4]\n\nLength 25 (odd).\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[0,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,0,4,4,4]\n\nLength 25 (odd).\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[4,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,0,4,4,0]\n\nLength 25 (odd).\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[4,0,4,0,4,4,0,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,0,4,4,0,0,4,0]\n\nLength 25 (odd).\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[4,4,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,4,4]\n\nLength 25 (odd).\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[4,0,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,4]\n\nLength 25 (odd).\n\nAll test lists seem to be odd-length. So according to the hypothesis, each list's middle-1 index is replaced. For length 25, that's index 11. So any 0 at index 11 becomes 2. But none of the test lists have a 0 at index 11. Except for the all-zero lists, which are already handled.\n\nThus, the outputs for the test input would mostly be the same as the inputs, except for the all-zero lists, which become all 2s.\n\nBut according to the examples, the replaced indices are not always the middle index. For example, Example 2 had a replaced index of 1, which is not near the middle. So there must be a different pattern.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think the correct answer is to replace the 0 at the position that is the length of the list minus 11. For example:\n\nFor length 19: 19-11=8 \u2192 index 8.\n\nFor length 14: 14-11=3 \u2192 index 3, but in Example 1, indices 4 and 10 are replaced. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, length -10:\n\n19-10=9 \u2192 index 9-1=8.\n\n14-10=4 \u2192 index 4 and 10.\n\n15-10=5 \u2192 index 5-4=1.\n\nThis fits the examples:\n\nExample 0: 19-10=9 \u2192 9-1=8.\n\nExample 1:14-10=4 \u2192 index 4 and 4+6=10.\n\nExample 2:15-10=5 \u21925-4=1.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the pattern could be:\n\nFor each list, replace the 0 at index (length -10) and for even-length lists, also index (length -10)+6.\n\nBut why +6? Not sure.\n\nBut in Example 1: length 14. 14-10=4. Replace index 4 and 4+6=10.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nFor Example 0: length 19. 19-10=9 \u2192 replaced index 9-1=8. But why subtract 1? Not sure.\n\nExample 2: length 15.15-10=5 \u21925-4=1. Where does the 4 come from?\n\nThis pattern is not clear. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the replaced indices are determined by length -10 for even and odd lengths.\n\nFor even-length lists: replace indices (length-10) and (length-10 +6).\n\nFor odd-length lists: replace index (length-10 -1).\n\nBut let's test:\n\nExample 0: length 19 (odd). 19-10=9 \u21929-1=8. Correct.\n\nExample 1: even. 14-10=4. 4+6=10. Correct.\n\nExample 2: odd.15-10=5 \u21925-1=4. But in Example 2, replaced index is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThus, this pattern is incorrect.\n\nFinal approach: Given that I cannot determine the exact pattern, but the examples show that replaced positions are specific to each example's list length and possibly the example's number, I'll assume that the test input follows the same pattern as the examples. Since the test input's first example has 4s and 0s, and the training examples replaced 0s at specific positions with 2, the test outputs should replace 0s at similar positions (based on list length) with 2. For all-zero lists, replace all with 2.\n\nGiven this, the final answer will have the same lists as the test input, with 0s at specific positions replaced by 2. For even-length lists, indices (length/2 -3) and (length/2 +3). For odd-length lists, index (length-1)/2 -1.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nThe test input has lists of varying lengths, but most are 25 elements (odd). For 25 elements, the replaced index is (25-1)/2 -1 =12-1=11. So check index 11 for each list. If it's 0, replace with 2. Otherwise, no change.\n\nFor example:\n\nTest list:\n\n[4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nIndex 11 is 4 \u2192 no change.\n\nAnother list:\n\n[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nIndex 11 is 4 \u2192 no change.\n\nAnother list:\n\n[0, 0, ..., 0] \u2192 all 2s.\n\nAnother list:\n\n[4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0]\n\nIndex 11 is 4 \u2192 no change.\n\nAnother list:\n\n[4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4]\n\nIndex 11 is 4 \u2192 no change.\n\nThus, the only changes in the test output are the all-zero lists being replaced with all 2s. All other lists remain the same except if they have a 0 at index 11. However, none of the test lists (except the all-zero ones) have a 0 at index 11. \n\nBut according to the examples, there are other cases where non-middle indices are replaced. For example, Example 2's lists have index 1 replaced. If that's the case, then perhaps for the test input's lists of length 25, the replaced index is 1. But why?\n\nThis is confusing. Given the time I have, I'll proceed to write the final answer based on the all-zero lists and possibly any lists with 0 at index 8 (if that's the replaced index). But since I can't confirm, I'll assume that the pattern is to replace the 0 at index 8 for odd-length lists. For length 25, index 8. Let's check the first test list:\n\nIndex 8 is 4. No change. Another list:\n\n[4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\n\nIndex 8 is 0 \u2192 replaced with 2.\n\nBut this is speculation. Without knowing the exact pattern, it's impossible to provide an accurate answer. However, based on the examples, the correct approach seems to be replacing specific indices with 2 if they are 0. For the test input, following the examples' pattern, the answer would have 2s in specific positions, especially in all-zero lists.\n\nAfter this extensive analysis, the correct answer likely involves replacing specific indices with 2 based on the list's length and whether the entire list is zeros. Applying this to the test input, especially converting all-zero lists to all 2s and other lists replacing 0s at certain positions (like index 8 for length 19), but given the test input's varying lengths, the correct outputs would be the test input lists with 0s at specific indices replaced by 2 and all-zero lists replaced with 2s.",
