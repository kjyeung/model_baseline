        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is about transforming an input grid of numbers into an output grid, and all the examples involve replacing the number 5 with either 1 or 2. Let me look at the training examples to see how they're doing that.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the input has 5s arranged in certain positions, and the output replaces some 5s with 1s and others with 2s. For instance, in the third row, the three 5s become 2s. Then, in the seventh row, there's a 5 that becomes a 1. So maybe the transformation depends on the position of the 5s relative to each other or their neighbors.\n\nIn Example 1, similar replacements happen. The 5s in the second row (like at [1][1], [1][2]) become 2s, and some others become 1s. The output here seems to have 2s where there are larger clusters of 5s. Wait, maybe the number of adjacent 5s determines whether it's a 1 or 2. Let's check.\n\nFor example, in Example 0's input, the third row's 5s are part of a 3x2 block. The output there is 2s. Then the seventh and eighth rows have 5s that are maybe in a different configuration. Perhaps it's about whether the 5 is part of a horizontal or vertical group. Wait, the 5s in the third row are horizontal, and they become 2s. The ones in the lower part (like row 7, column 1-2) are vertical and become 1s? Hmm, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's input and output. The first row has three 5s on the left and three on the right. The output turns the left into 1s and the right into 2s. Maybe the left side is one cluster and the right another. But how to differentiate them?\n\nWait, perhaps the direction of the connections. Maybe 2 represents horizontal connections and 1 represents vertical. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0, the third row has three 5s in a row (horizontal), which become 2s. Then the seventh row has two 5s stacked vertically (rows 7 and 8, columns 1-2), which become 1s. So that seems to fit. Similarly, in Example 1, the first row's 5s in the second row (positions [1][1-2]) are horizontal and become 2s, but the ones in the seventh row (positions [6][5-6] maybe) are horizontal and become 2s again. Wait, but in Example 1's output, the first row's 5 is replaced by 1, but maybe that's a single 5. Hmm, perhaps the rule is that 5s are replaced by 2 if they are part of a horizontal group (at least two adjacent horizontally), and 1 if part of a vertical group. But wait, in Example 0's input, the group in rows 3-4, columns 3-5 is a 2x3 block. So in that case, the horizontal adjacent 5s would be in the same row. So in the output, those become 2s, even though they are in two rows. So maybe it's per-cell: if a cell has a 5 and is part of a horizontal group (i.e., has a 5 to the left or right), then it becomes 2. If it's part of a vertical group (has a 5 above or below), then it becomes 1. But how to handle cells that are part of both? Like in a 2x2 block.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input. The first row has three 5s on the left. Each of those has horizontal neighbors, so they become 1s? Wait, no, the output here is [1,1,1,0,...], so they are 1s. Wait, but according to the previous idea, horizontal would be 2. Hmm, maybe I need to re-examine.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the first row's leftmost 5s are part of a horizontal group (they are in a row). The output for those is 1. But that contradicts the earlier idea. So maybe the direction is different. Alternatively, maybe the output alternates between 1 and 2 based on some other criteria, like their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers 1 and 2 represent different regions. For example, each contiguous region of 5s is assigned a number, either 1 or 2, based on some rule. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, there are two regions of 5s. The first is the 3x2 block in rows 2-3, columns 2-4. The second is the lower part: a 2x2 in rows 5-6, columns 6-7, then another group in row 7, columns 1-2, and row 8, columns 1-3. Wait, but in the output, the upper 3x2 block becomes 2s, and the lower groups become 2s and 1s. Hmm, that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parity of the region. Like, the first region is 2, the next is 1, and so on. But in Example 0, the output has regions: the upper 3x2 (2s), then a 2x2 (rows 5-6, cols 6-7) which becomes 2s, then the vertical ones in rows 7-8, cols 1-2 become 1s. So maybe the first region is 2, second is 2, third is 1. That doesn't fit a simple parity.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the number depends on the orientation of the group. If the group is wider than it is tall (horizontal), it's 2; if taller than wide (vertical), it's 1. For example, in Example 0, the upper 3x2 group (rows 2-3, cols 2-4) is 3 columns wide and 2 rows tall. So width > height, so 2. The group in rows 5-6, columns 6-7 is 2x2, so same, maybe 2. The vertical group in rows 7-8, columns 1-2 (height 2, width 2, so same) but the output is 1. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, the vertical group in Example 0's input is in rows 7-8, columns 1-2. The output here is 1s. But the group's height is 2 and width is 2. Maybe when the group is connected vertically (i.e., cells stacked vertically), it's 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction of the connection. If a cell is connected to another cell to the left or right, it's part of a horizontal group (2). If connected above or below, vertical group (1). But cells can be part of both. For example, in a 2x2 block, each cell is connected both horizontally and vertically. So which takes precedence?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input. The first row has three 5s in a row (horizontal), which become 1s. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous idea. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the first row is [5,5,5,0,...]. The output is [1,1,1,...]. According to the previous idea, horizontal groups would be 2, but here it's 1. So that's a contradiction.\n\nHmm, maybe the numbers 1 and 2 are determined by the layer or the order in which the regions are processed. Like the first region encountered is 1, the next is 2, and alternates. But how to define the order. Maybe left to right, top to bottom.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first 5s encountered are the 3x2 block. Assign them 2. Then the next group is the lower ones. Let's see: the next group is maybe in row 5, col 6-7. Assign 2. Then the vertical group in rows 7-8, cols 1-2. Assign 1. Hmm, but why 2 first? Maybe the regions are ordered by their position. Like the upper regions are 2, lower regions 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number depends on the distance from the edges. For example, regions closer to the left or top are 1, others 2. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output again. The first three 5s in the first row become 1s, while the three at the end become 2s. Maybe the left part is 1 and the right part is 2. But why? They are separate regions, so each region is assigned a different number. So the first region (leftmost) is 1, next region (rightmost) is 2. So regions are assigned 1 and 2 based on their order of occurrence.\n\nIn Example 0, the first region is the 3x2 block, assigned 2. Then the next group (lower) is also assigned 2. Then the vertical group is 1. That doesn't fit the order idea. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the test input and see if applying a certain rule would generate the expected output. But without knowing the answer, this is tricky.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe test input is a 10x10 grid. Let's see the 5s:\n\nRow 0: 5s at positions 1,2 and 6,7.\n\nRow 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: 5s in columns 0-3, and 5 and 6.\n\nRow 4: 5s at 1,2 and 7.\n\nRow 5: 5s at 1-4 (columns 1-4) and 7.\n\nRow 6: 5 at column 7.\n\nRow 7: 5 at column 7.\n\nRow 8: 5s in columns 1-5.\n\nSo the regions:\n\n- The first two rows have two horizontal groups each (positions 1-2 and 6-7). These might be part of the same region if connected. But rows 0 and 1: in row 0, columns 1-2 are 5s. Row 1, same. Are they connected vertically? So that's a 2x2 block. So this would be a vertical group? Or a 2x2 square.\n\n- Row 2 has a group of 5s from columns 0-3 (four in a row) and another at columns 5-6.\n\n- Row 4 has 5s at 1-2 and 7. Row 5 has 5s at 1-4 and 7. So maybe the 1-4 in row5 connects to row4's 1-2?\n\nWait, let's outline each region.\n\nFirst region: rows 0-1, columns 1-2. It's a 2x2 block. Also, rows 0-1, columns 6-7: another 2x2 block. Are these connected? No, separated by zeros. So two separate regions.\n\nSecond region: row 2, columns 0-3 (four 5s in a row). Then, row 2, column 5-6: two 5s.\n\nThen row 4: columns 1-2, and column7.\n\nRow5: columns1-4 (four 5s) and column7.\n\nRow8: columns1-5 (five 5s in a row).\n\nHmm, but how these connect. For example, row4's 1-2 (5s) might connect to row5's 1-4. So that's a vertical connection. So the 5s in row4, 1-2 and row5, 1-4 form a region that's L-shaped. Similarly, row5's column7 5 connects to row4's column7. Then rows6-7's column7 5s would connect vertically.\n\nSo possible regions:\n\n1. Rows0-1, cols1-2: 2x2 block.\n\n2. Rows0-1, cols6-7: 2x2 block.\n\n3. Row2, cols0-3: horizontal line of 4.\n\n4. Row2, cols5-6: horizontal line of 2.\n\n5. Rows4-5, cols1-2 and 1-4: maybe a larger region.\n\nWait, row4 has 5s at 1-2 and 7. Row5 has 5s at 1-4 and 7. So row4's 1-2 are connected to row5's 1-4, making a larger region. Similarly, column7 in rows4-5 might connect to rows6-7's column7.\n\nAnother approach: look at each cell and see if it's part of a horizontal or vertical group.\n\nIn the training examples, when a 5 is part of a horizontal group (has left/right neighbors), it becomes 2. If part of vertical (up/down neighbors), becomes 1. But if both, perhaps which takes priority.\n\nIn Example 0's row7, column1-2: 5s in rows7 and 8, column1. So vertical connection. So becomes 1. Similarly, in row5-6, column6-7: horizontal, so 2.\n\nBut in Example2, the first row's 5s are all horizontal, but they become 1s. That contradicts the initial idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output number depends on the number of connected directions. Like, if a cell is connected horizontally, it's 2; if vertically, 1. If both, maybe 2 takes priority, or 1. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 2, the first row's 5s are connected horizontally. They become 1s, which would contradict. So that's not it.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the numbers 1 and 2 represent different \"generations\" of the regions. For example, the first time a region is encountered (left to right, top to bottom), it's assigned 1, next 2, then back to 1, etc. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first 5s are in rows2-3, cols2-4. That's the first region. Assign 2. Then the next region is in rows5-6, cols6-7. Assign 2 again. Then the vertical group in rows7-8, cols1-2. Assign 1. Hmm, that doesn't fit a simple alternation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe regions are alternately colored 1 and 2 like a checkerboard. But it's unclear.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output numbers, in Example 0, the output has 2s where the 5s formed blocks of 3x2 (rows2-3) and 2x2 (rows5-6). The 1s are in vertical pairs. So perhaps 2 is for larger groups, 1 for smaller? But in Example1, some 2s are small clusters. For example, in Example1's output, the first row's 5 is replaced by 1, but in the second row, the 5s are 2s. Maybe the number of adjacent 5s determines it. If a 5 has more horizontal neighbors, it's 2. More vertical, it's 1.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the direction in which the group is connected. If a group is primarily horizontal (like a horizontal line), then 2. If vertical, then 1. For example, a horizontal line of 5s becomes 2s. A vertical line becomes 1s. But how to handle more complex shapes.\n\nWait, in Example2's input, the first row is three 5s in a horizontal line. The output is 1s. That would contradict the horizontal=2 idea. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value depends on the position in the grid. Like, even rows or columns get 1, others 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers 1 and 2 could represent different layers. For example, overlapping groups where horizontal is 2 and vertical is 1. But how to handle overlapping.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe 5s are replaced by 1 if they are part of a vertical edge and 2 if part of a horizontal edge. But not sure.\n\nLooking back at the test input. Let's see if applying a certain pattern would work. For instance, if horizontal groups (left-right connected) are 2, vertical (up-down) are 1.\n\nIn the test input:\n\n- The first two rows have two 2x2 blocks (cols1-2 and cols6-7). Each of these is a 2x2 square. So each cell is connected both horizontally and vertically. So which do we choose? If horizontal takes precedence, then 2. If vertical, 1. But in Example0's similar 2x2 block in rows5-6, cols6-7, the output was 2. So perhaps horizontal takes precedence.\n\nSo in the test input's first two rows, cols1-2 and 6-7 would be 2s. Then row2 has a horizontal line of four 5s (cols0-3) which would be 2s. The next group in row2, cols5-6 (horizontal) would be 2s. Then row4's cols1-2 (vertical connection to row5's cols1-4) would be vertical. So row4's 1-2 and row5's 1-4 form a vertical connection. So that would be 1s. Row5's cols1-4 are horizontal, but connected vertically to row4's 1-2. So maybe this is a vertical group. Then row5's col7 is connected to row4's col7, so vertical (1). Then row6-7's col7 is vertical (1s). Row8's cols1-5 is a horizontal line, so 2s.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nRow0: [0,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow2: [2,2,2,2,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut let's check the training examples to see if this aligns.\n\nIn Example1's output, the first row has a single 5 at the end replaced by 1. The second row's 5s are replaced by 2s. But those are part of a horizontal group, so 2. The group in row6-7 (cols5-6) in the test input would be horizontal, so 2.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe another way to approach is to look for the output numbers 1 and 2 and see if they correspond to the number of adjacent 5s in a certain direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 5s are replaced by 1 if they are on an even row (0-based) and 2 if odd, or something like that. But in Example0's row2 (0-based row 2 is even), but the output is 2. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement depends on the sum of the coordinates. For example, (row + column) even or odd. But Example0's row2, column2 (5 becomes 2): 2+2=4 even. So 2. row7, column1: 7+1=8 even. Output is 1. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output numbers are based on whether the cell is in a horizontal or vertical \"run\". A horizontal run is a consecutive sequence in a row, vertical in a column. So each horizontal run becomes 2, vertical run becomes 1. But for cells that are part of both, perhaps horizontal takes precedence.\n\nIn Example0's input, the group in rows2-3, columns2-4 is a horizontal run in each row. So each row's 5s are horizontal, so they become 2. The vertical group in rows7-8, columns1-2 is a vertical run, so they become 1. The group in rows5-6, columns6-7: row5 has a horizontal pair, row6 has a horizontal triplet. So they become 2s.\n\nIn Example2's first row, the horizontal run becomes 1s. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe this approach is not correct.\n\nWait, in Example2's input, the first row's left three 5s are part of a horizontal run. The output is 1. But according to the previous idea, it should be 2. So perhaps this is not the case.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe 1 represents vertical connections and 2 horizontal, but the direction is determined by the majority in the region. For example, if the region is more horizontal (longer in rows), it's 2; if more vertical, 1.\n\nIn Example0's upper region (3x2) is wider (columns 3 vs rows 2), so 2. The vertical group (2 rows tall, 2 columns wide) is same, but perhaps the shape is more vertical. So 1.\n\nIn Example2's first row's left three 5s are a horizontal line, so 2. But the output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Maybe looking for another pattern. For example, in Example0's output, the 2s form horizontal lines, and 1s form vertical lines. Let me check:\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\n- Rows2-3, columns2-4: 2s, horizontal.\n\n- Rows5-6, columns6-7: 2s, horizontal in each row.\n\n- Rows7-8, columns1-3: 1s, vertical.\n\nYes, so maybe horizontal clusters are 2, vertical clusters are 1.\n\nBut in Example2's first row, the horizontal cluster is 1. Contradiction. Unless there's another factor.\n\nWait, looking at Example2's output:\n\nThe first three 5s in row0 are replaced by 1s. But they are horizontal. So that's a contradiction. So maybe there's a different rule.\n\nAlternative approach: The replacement number alternates between 1 and 2 for each contiguous region, starting with 1. Or perhaps the parity of the region's position. For example, first region is 1, second is 2, third is 1, etc.\n\nIn Example0's input, the first region is the upper 3x2 block. If that's the first region, output is 2. So maybe starting with 2. Then the next region (lower 2x2) would be 2 again. Then the vertical region would be 1. That doesn't follow a clear alternating pattern.\n\nIn Example1's input, the first region (row0, col8) is a single 5. Output is 1. The next region (row1, cols1-2) is 2. Then row2, cols0-3: 2. Row4-5's regions: 1. So the pattern is not clear.\n\nHmm. Maybe the replacement is based on whether the region is connected to the top or left edges. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 5s in the region modulo 2. If even, 2; if odd, 1. But Example0's upper region has 6 5s (even), becomes 2. Lower regions: the 2x2 has 4 (even), becomes 2. Vertical group has 4 (even), becomes 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Looking for how the 5s are replaced in the examples. In Example0:\n\nInput 5 becomes output 2 in rows2-3, cols2-4 (horizontal blocks).\n\nInput 5 becomes 1 in rows7-8, cols1-2 (vertical).\n\nIn Example1:\n\nRow1, cols1-2: 5s become 2 (horizontal).\n\nRow6, cols5-6: 5s become 2 (horizontal).\n\nRows7-8, cols1-2: 5s become 1 (vertical).\n\nRow0, col8: 5 becomes 1 (single).\n\nIn Example2:\n\nRow0, cols0-2: 5s become 1 (horizontal).\n\nRow0, cols7-9: 5s become 2 (horizontal).\n\nRow1, cols0-3: 5s become 2 (horizontal?), but output is 1.\n\nWait, no. Example2's row0 input is [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5], output [1,1,1,0,...,2,2,2]. So the left three 5s are 1, right three are 2.\n\nSo the same row has two regions of 5s, one replaced with 1 and the other with 2. So it's not per-row, but per-region.\n\nSo perhaps each contiguous region of 5s is assigned either 1 or 2 based on its orientation. But how to determine that.\n\nIn Example2's left region of row0: horizontal, becomes 1. Right region: horizontal, becomes 2. So orientation is not the factor. Then what?\n\nMaybe the position relative to other regions. If a region is to the left of another, it's 1, else 2. But in Example0, the upper region is to the left of others but becomes 2.\n\nAlternatively, the number depends on whether the region is connected to the left or right half of the grid. Example2's left region is in the left half (cols0-2), becomes 1. Right region (cols7-9) becomes 2. That could be possible.\n\nIn Example0, the upper region is in the middle, cols2-4. Maybe middle regions are 2, left regions are 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the regions are alternately colored 1 and 2 based on their leftmost position. The first region (leftmost) is 1, next is 2, etc.\n\nIn Example0's input, the upper region starts at column2. The next region starts at column6. So first region is 2, second is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nIn Example2's input, leftmost region is cols0-2 (assigned 1), next is cols7-9 (assigned 2). Then the next regions are perhaps cols0-3 in row2, assigned 2. So maybe leftmost regions are 1, others 2. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number 1 is assigned to regions that are connected to the top edge, and 2 to others. But in Example0, the upper region is connected to row2 (not top), and becomes 2.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the key is to look for the direction of the connection when the region is first encountered.\n\nLet me try to outline the regions in each example and see what numbers they are assigned.\n\nExample0 input regions:\n\n1. 3x2 block at rows2-3, cols2-4. Output: 2.\n\n2. 2x2 block at rows5-6, cols6-7. Output: 2.\n\n3. Vertical 2x2 block at rows7-8, cols1-2. Output:1.\n\n4. A small group in row8, cols3-5? Or maybe part of another region.\n\nExample1 input regions:\n\n1. Single 5 at row0, col8. Output:1.\n\n2. 2x2 block row1, cols1-2. Output:2.\n\n3. Row2, cols0-3: 4 5s. Output:2.\n\n4. Row4, cols2-5:4 5s. Output:1.\n\n5. Row5, col8: 5. Output:1.\n\n6. Row6-7, cols5-6: 2x2 block. Output:2.\n\n7. Rows7-8, cols1-2: 2x2 vertical. Output:1.\n\nExample2's input regions:\n\n1. Left three 5s row0, cols0-2. Output:1.\n\n2. Right three 5s row0, cols7-9. Output:2.\n\n3. Row1, cols0-3: 4 5s. Output:2.\n\n4. Row2, cols2-3: maybe part of row1's region.\n\n5. Row4, cols2-5: 4 5s. Output:1.\n\n6. Row5, col8:5. Output:1.\n\n7. Row6-7, cols5-6: 2x2. Output:2.\n\n8. Row8, cols1-4:4 5s. Output:1.\n\nHmm, in Example1, the first region is a single 5 (output 1). Next region is a horizontal group (output 2). Next is a larger horizontal group (output 2). Then a horizontal group (output1). So it's alternating 1,2,2,1, etc. Not clear.\n\nIn Example2, regions alternate 1,2,2,1, etc. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number depends on the number of 5s in the region. If the region has an even number of 5s, it's 2; if odd, 1.\n\nExample0's first region:6 5s (even) \u2192 2. Second region:4 \u2192 2. Third region: 4 \u2192 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample1's first region:1 (odd) \u2192 1. Second region:2 (even) \u21922. Third:4 (even) \u21922. Fourth:4 \u21921. Hmm, no.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the replacement is based on the minimum number of steps required to reach the nearest edge. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers 1 and 2 represent different types of shapes. For example, 1 for vertical lines, 2 for horizontal lines. But in Example2, the first three 5s are horizontal but replaced with 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nPerhaps the key is to look for the direction in which the region is longest. For example, if a region's width is greater than its height, it's 2; else, 1.\n\nExample0's first region: width 3, height 2. Width > height \u2192 2. Second region: 2x2 \u2192 same. But output is 2. Third region: 2x2 (height and width equal). Output is 1. So maybe if width >= height \u21922, else 1. But for equal, perhaps it's considered vertical (1).\n\nExample2's first region: width 3, height 1. Width>height \u21922. But output is 1. So contradicts.\n\nThis is frustrating. Maybe I'm missing something obvious.\n\nAnother approach: Look at the output numbers and see if they correspond to the number of adjacent 5s in a certain direction. For example, count the number of horizontal neighbors (left and right) and vertical neighbors (up and down). If the sum of horizontal neighbors is greater than vertical, it's 2; else, 1.\n\nFor Example0's row2, col2 (5 has left and right neighbors, so horizontal sum 2. Vertical: up and down. In row2, the cell above is 0, below is 5 (from row3). So vertical sum 1. So horizontal sum > vertical \u2192 2. That fits.\n\nFor row7, col1: 5. Horizontal neighbors: left is 0 (row7, col0 is 0?), right is 5 (col2). So horizontal sum 1. Vertical: above (row6, col1 is 0?), below (row8, col1 is 5). Vertical sum 1. So equal. Maybe in this case, vertical takes precedence. So output 1.\n\nBut how to handle cells with equal sums. Maybe in such cases, it's vertical.\n\nExample2's first row, col0: 5. Right neighbors are 5,5. Left none. So horizontal sum 2. Vertical: row1, col0 is 5. So vertical sum 1. So horizontal sum > \u21922. But output is 1. Contradiction.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Maybe the pattern is not based on neighbors but on the entire region's shape. For example, all regions that are horizontal lines (single row) are 2, and vertical lines (single column) are 1. Other shapes like L-shapes are determined by their main orientation.\n\nBut in Example0, the upper region is two rows of horizontal 5s. So each row is a horizontal line, hence 2. The vertical group is two columns of 5s in rows7-8, so vertical lines \u21921.\n\nIn Example2's first row, the left three 5s are a horizontal line \u2192 should be 2. But output is 1. Contradicts.\n\nHmm. Maybe the regions are classified based on whether they form a straight line (horizontal or vertical). If they do, then 2 for horizontal, 1 for vertical. Otherwise, something else. But the first row of Example2's left three are a straight horizontal line but become 1. So not.\n\nAlternatively, the regions are labeled based on their position in the grid. For instance, the first region encountered when scanning left to right, top to bottom is 1, next 2, and so on, alternating.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nScan order: first 5 is at row2, col2. The upper region is the first, labeled 2. Then next region is the lower 2x2, labeled 2 again. Then the vertical group, labeled 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nExample1:\n\nFirst region is row0, col8 (single 5) \u21921. Next is row1, col1-2 \u21922. Then row2, col0-3 \u21922. Then row4, col2-5 \u21921. So alternating 1,2,2,1. Not sure.\n\nExample2:\n\nFirst region row0, col0-2 \u21921. Next row0, col7-9 \u21922. Then row1, col0-3 \u21922. Then row4, col2-5 \u21921. So alternates 1,2,2,1. Hmm, perhaps every new region alternates. But in Example0, the first two regions are 2, which breaks the pattern.\n\nThis is really challenging. Perhaps I need to consider that the replacement numbers 1 and 2 are arbitrary and the actual pattern is something else. But the fact that in Example0, some 5s become 1 and others 2 suggests there's a systematic way.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the number 1 represents regions that are connected to the bottom of the grid, and 2 to the top. But no, in Example0, the vertical group is at the bottom and becomes 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number is determined by the row parity. Even rows (0-based) become 1, odd rows 2. But in Example0's row2 (even) becomes 2, which contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are assigned based on the column's parity. For example, even columns (0-based) are 1, odd are 2. But in Example0's row2, col2 (even) becomes 2.\n\nThis is really tricky. I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently.\n\nLooking at Example0's output, every 5 in the input is replaced by either 1 or 2. So the transformation is replacing 5s with either 1 or 2 based on some condition.\n\nLet's look at the positions of the 5s in the input and the output:\n\nExample0 input:\n\nRow2, cols2-4: 5s \u2192 output 2.\n\nRow3, cols2-4: 5s \u2192 2.\n\nRow5, cols6-7: 5s \u21922.\n\nRow6, cols6-8: 5s \u21922.\n\nRow7, cols1-2:5s \u21921.\n\nRow8, cols1-3:5s \u21921.\n\nSo in the input, the 5s in rows2-3 (upper part) are replaced by 2. Lower parts (rows7-8) by 1.\n\nExample1 input:\n\nRow0, col8:5 \u21921.\n\nRow1, cols1-2:5s \u21922.\n\nRow2, cols0-3:5s \u21922.\n\nRow4, cols2-5:5s \u21921.\n\nRow6, cols5-6:5s \u21922.\n\nRow7-8, cols1-2:5s \u21921.\n\nExample2:\n\nRow0, cols0-2:5s \u21921.\n\nRow0, cols7-9:5s \u21922.\n\nRow1, cols0-3:5s \u21922.\n\nRow4, cols2-5:5s \u21921.\n\nRow8, cols1-4:5s \u21921.\n\nSo in Example2, left regions are 1, right regions are 2. Maybe the regions are split between left and right halves of the grid. If a region is in the left half (cols0-4), it's 1; right half (cols5-9) it's 2. Let's check.\n\nExample0:\n\nUpper region is cols2-4 (left half), becomes 2. So no.\n\nExample1:\n\nRow0, col8 (right half) becomes 1. So no.\n\nHmm. Not working.\n\nAlternatively, the leftmost region is 1, next 2, etc. But in Example2, the leftmost is 1, then the rightmost is 2, then row1's left region is 2. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The numbers 1 and 2 might represent different layers based on how the regions are connected. For example, regions that are connected via diagonal or not. But I can't see how that applies.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the replacement number is determined by whether the 5 is part of a \"corner\" in a larger shape. But I can't see a clear pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as representing different \"depths\" or layers. For example, the first layer (closer to the top) is 2, deeper layers are 1. But in Example0's upper region is 2, lower is 1. That fits. In Example1's row1-2's regions are 2, lower regions are 1. Yes. Example2's left region (row0) is 1, but it's upper. So maybe the opposite.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output number is 2 if the 5 is part of a group that touches the top or bottom edge, and 1 otherwise. But in Example0's upper region is near the top, but not touching the edge. Output is 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Maybe I need to look for the simplest possible pattern that fits all examples. Let's think: all 5s are replaced by 1 or 2. The key is to determine which.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe test input has several regions. Let's try to apply the possible patterns.\n\nFor example, if horizontal groups are 2, vertical are 1:\n\nTest input's first two rows have 2x2 blocks (cols1-2 and cols6-7). These are squares, so both horizontal and vertical. Maybe the direction of the majority of connections. Since each cell has both, maybe default to 2. So these would become 2.\n\nRow2's cols0-3: horizontal line \u21922.\n\nRow2's cols5-6: horizontal \u21922.\n\nRow4's cols1-2 and row5's cols1-4: this is a vertical connection. For example, row4's 1-2 connected to row5's 1-4. This forms a T-shape. So the vertical part (rows4-5, cols1-2) would be 1, and the horizontal part (row5's 3-4) would be 2. But this is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, each cell is part of a vertical or horizontal group based on its individual connections. For example, a cell with a neighbor to the left or right becomes 2; else if neighbor above or below, becomes 1.\n\nIn the test input's first two rows, cols1-2 and 6-7:\n\nEach cell in cols1-2 has neighbors to the left/right (horizontal), so 2. Similarly for cols6-7.\n\nRow2's cols0-3: each has horizontal neighbors \u21922.\n\nRow4's cols1-2: each has a neighbor below (row5's cols1-4) \u2192 vertical \u21921. But row5's cols1-4 have horizontal neighbors \u21922. So row4's cols1-2 would be 1, row5's 1-4 would be 2.\n\nRow5's col7: has neighbor above (row4) \u2192 vertical \u21921. Row6's col7: has neighbor below (row7) \u2192 vertical \u21921.\n\nRow8's cols1-5: horizontal \u21922.\n\nApplying this, the output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,0,0]\n\nRow1: same as row0.\n\nRow2: [2,2,2,2,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,2,2,2,2,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis seems plausible and matches some of the training examples. For example, in Example0's vertical group (rows7-8, cols1-2), each cell has a vertical neighbor, so becomes 1. The horizontal groups become 2. Similarly, in Example1's row1, cols1-2 are horizontal \u21922. Row6's cols5-6 are horizontal \u21922. \n\nBut in Example2's first row, the left three 5s are horizontal \u2192 should be 2, but output is 1. Contradiction. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the rule is the opposite: vertical groups are 2, horizontal are 1. But Example0's horizontal groups are 2. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that if a 5 has any horizontal neighbors, it becomes 2; else, if vertical, 1. Even if it has both.\n\nIn Example0's upper 3x2 block, each 5 has horizontal and vertical neighbors. But they become 2. So horizontal takes precedence. The vertical group has horizontal neighbors (each cell in cols1-2 has a neighbor to the left/right?), but in rows7-8, cols1-2: row7's col1-2 are horizontal neighbors, but output is 1. Contradicts.\n\nThis is really challenging. At this point, I think the best approach is to hypothesize that the replacement is based on horizontal groups being 2 and vertical groups being 1, and apply that to the test input, even if there's a contradiction with Example2. Because otherwise, I can't proceed.\n\nApplying that to the test input:\n\n- All horizontal groups (left/right connected) become 2.\n\n- Vertical groups (up/down connected) become 1.\n\nIn the test input's first two rows, cols1-2 and 6-7 are 2x2 squares. Each cell has both horizontal and vertical neighbors. According to the rule, horizontal takes precedence, so 2.\n\nRow2's cols0-3: horizontal \u21922.\n\nRow2's cols5-6: horizontal \u21922.\n\nRow4's cols1-2: connected to row5's cols1-4. Vertical connection. So becomes 1.\n\nRow5's cols1-4: horizontal \u21922.\n\nRow5's col7: connected to row4's col7 (vertical) \u21921.\n\nRow6-7's col7: vertical \u21921.\n\nRow8's cols1-5: horizontal \u21922.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[0,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,0,0]\n\n[0,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,0,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,2,2,2,2,0,0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n\n[0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut how does this compare to the training examples? For Example2's first row, which has three horizontal 5s, according to this rule, they should be 2, but the output is 1. So this must be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, there's another pattern. \n\nPerhaps the numbers 1 and 2 alternate based on the region's location in the grid. For example, if the region's top-left cell is in an even column, it's 1; odd column, 2. \n\nIn Example0's upper region starts at column2 (even), so 2. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the first region is 2, the next is 1, and so on. But in Example0, the first two regions are 2, then 1. So perhaps the first region is 2, second 2, third 1. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the correct answer is to replace every 5 with 1 if it's part of a vertical group and 2 if part of a horizontal group, and in cases where both are present, prioritize horizontal.\n\nBased on that, the test input's output would be as I hypothesized earlier. Even if Example2 contradicts, perhaps there's an exception in that case, but for the test input, this pattern works.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples. Let's start by looking closely at the examples provided.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has 5s in certain positions, and the output replaces those with 1s and 2s. Let me compare the input and output cell by cell. \n\nLooking at the third row of input in Example 0: [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0]. The output for this row is [0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 5s here became 2s. Then in the seventh row of input, there's a [0,5,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0], and the output is [0,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]. Here, the two 5s at positions 1 and 2 turned into 1s, and the single 5 at position 6 became a 2. Hmm, so maybe the number of adjacent 5s determines whether it's a 1 or 2?\n\nWait, but how? Let me check another part. In Example 0's eighth row input: [0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0], output is [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Those three 5s became 1s. But in the sixth row input of Example 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0] becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0]. So two 5s here became 2s. So perhaps the value depends on the number of adjacent cells? Or maybe the shape of the 5s cluster?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers represent the number of adjacent 5s each cell has. But let's test that. For example, in the first 5 in Example 0's third row (third cell), adjacent cells: up is 0, down is 5 (fourth row), left is 0, right is 5. So maybe counting how many 5s are adjacent? Wait, but that cell is part of a 3x2 block. Let's see: the cell at (2,2) (assuming 0-based) is 5. Its neighbors would be (2,1)=0, (2,3)=5, (1,2)=0, (3,2)=5. So two adjacent 5s. But in the output, it's 2. Hmm, maybe the output is the count of adjacent 5s, but that doesn't match. For the cell (2,2), adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and diagonals?) Or maybe orthogonal neighbors only.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is indicating regions where the 5s form certain shapes. Like 1 for vertical blocks and 2 for horizontal? But looking at Example 0's output: in row 7, there's a vertical pair (1s) and in row 6, horizontal (2s). Wait, in row 6 input, the 5s are in positions 6 and 7, which are adjacent horizontally. The output here is 2. In row 7, input has 5s at positions 1 and 2 (vertical?), but in the output they are 1s. Wait, the input in row 7 is [0,5,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0], so positions 1 and 2 are 5s. Are those adjacent vertically? Wait, row 7, columns 1 and 2. So in the same row, adjacent horizontally. So why are they 1s in the output? That contradicts the idea that horizontal is 2. Maybe another approach.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has various 5s. In the output, some become 1, others 2. Let's look at the second row: input is [0,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,0], output is [0,2,2,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. The first two 5s became 2, the next three became 1. What's different about those groups? The first two 5s are adjacent horizontally (positions 1 and 2), and the next three are a horizontal line (positions 6,7,8). Wait, but in output they are 1s. Hmm. Maybe the direction isn't the factor here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the size of the connected component. For example, in Example 0, the 3x2 block of 5s in the middle is converted to 2s. But wait, in the output of Example 0, the 3x2 becomes 2s. Then in the other clusters, like the two 5s in row 5, they become 2s. The three 5s in row 7 and 8 become 1s. So perhaps the number of adjacent 5s in a certain direction. \n\nWait, perhaps the output is 1 for vertical clusters and 2 for horizontal. Let's test this. In Example 0, the third and fourth rows have a 3x2 block. Wait, but those 5s form a rectangle. How does that fit? Maybe if a cluster is taller vertically, it's 1, else 2. Alternatively, maybe it's the orientation of the cluster. For example, a vertical line (like two cells stacked vertically) would be 1, and a horizontal line (two cells side by side) would be 2. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's seventh row input: [0,5,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. The two 5s here are in columns 1 and 2 of row 7. So adjacent horizontally. The output here is [0,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]. The first two are 1s, and the single 5 becomes a 2. Wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the output is determined by the number of cells in the connected component. For example, 1 for vertical and 2 for horizontal, but how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output numbers: maybe 1 represents vertical \"blocks\" (like a 2x1 or more in vertical direction), and 2 represents horizontal blocks (like 1x2 or more in horizontal direction). So for a group of 5s that form a vertical line, they become 1s, and horizontal lines become 2s. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the third and fourth rows have 3x2 blocks. Wait, but those are more like rectangles. For example, rows 2 and 3 (third and fourth rows) have 5s in columns 2,3,4. So each of those rows has three 5s, and two rows. So this is a 3x2 block. How does this translate to output? The output for this block is 2s. Hmm. So maybe 2 is for horizontal blocks. But that's a 3x2, which is not a line. So perhaps it's not just lines. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input: in the second row, [5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0] becomes [2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,1,0]. So a horizontal line of four 5s becomes 2s, and the single 5 at the end becomes 1. But that single 5 is adjacent to another 5 in the row above? Let me check the first row of input in Example 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0]. The output is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]. So the single 5 becomes 1. So maybe isolated 5s become 1, but in other cases, like horizontal lines, they become 2. But how about vertical lines?\n\nIn Example 1's seventh row input: [0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0], output is [0,1,1,0,0,2,2,0,0,0]. So the first two 5s are vertical? Let's see. Row 7, columns 1 and 2: input has 5,5. Are these part of a vertical line? Let's check row 6: row 6 input is [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0], which becomes [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0]. So those 5s in row 6, columns 5 and 6 are horizontal, output 2. But in row 7, the first two 5s (columns 1 and 2) are adjacent vertically. Wait, because in row 8, the input is [0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0], so same as row 7. So the 5s in column 1 and 2 of rows 7 and 8 form a vertical 2x2 block. In the output, rows 7 and 8 have 1s for those positions. So vertical clusters become 1, horizontal become 2. That makes sense. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each cell in the input that is a 5, in the output, if the 5 is part of a vertical cluster (i.e., connected vertically with other 5s), it becomes 1. If it's part of a horizontal cluster (connected horizontally), it becomes 2. If a 5 is isolated (no adjacent 5s), perhaps it's 1? Or maybe depends on the direction of the cluster.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's seventh row input: [0,5,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. The first two 5s are horizontal (same row, adjacent columns). But in the output, they become 1s. But according to the previous logic, horizontal clusters should be 2. So that contradicts. Hmm. So maybe the direction is determined by the majority of the cluster. Like if a cluster is taller than it is wide, it's vertical (1), else horizontal (2). Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's seventh row, the two 5s are horizontal. So their cluster is 1 row high and 2 columns wide. So width > height \u2192 horizontal (2). But the output is 1 here. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the orientation of the individual cell's connections. Like, if a cell has a 5 above or below, it's vertical (1), if left or right, horizontal (2). But in the case of a cell that has both, perhaps a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe the output for a 5 cell is 1 if it is part of a vertical line (i.e., connected vertically) and 2 if part of a horizontal line. But how to handle cells that are part of both, like in a cross shape.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's third and fourth rows. The 3x2 block. Each cell in this block has neighbors both to the right and below. So for those, perhaps they are part of a horizontal group (since they form a horizontal line in their row) and thus become 2. That's consistent with their output being 2. \n\nIn Example 1's second row input: [5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0]. The first four 5s are horizontal, so output is 2. The last 5 is isolated (in that row) but in the row above (first row), the last column is 5. So perhaps that's part of a vertical line. So the output for that 5 is 1. So that's consistent.\n\nNow, in Example 0's seventh row input, the two horizontal 5s (positions 1 and 2) become 1. But according to the previous logic, they are horizontal and should be 2. So maybe there's another factor. Wait, looking at the entire cluster in Example 0's input. The 5s in rows 7 and 8 (assuming rows are 0-indexed). Let's see:\n\nRow 7: [0,5,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo in row 7, columns 1 and 2 are 5s. In row 8, columns 1,2,3 are 5s. So the cluster here is a kind of T-shape. So the cell at (7,1) has a 5 below it (8,1). So vertically connected. So maybe each cell is checked for vertical connections. If a cell has a 5 above or below, it's considered part of a vertical cluster (1), otherwise part of a horizontal cluster (2).\n\nSo in the case of the two 5s in row 7, columns 1 and 2. For cell (7,1): it has a 5 below it (8,1). So vertical \u2192 1. For cell (7,2): has a 5 below (8,2) \u2192 vertical \u2192 1. So they become 1s. The 5 in row 7, column 6 (position 6) is alone in that row, but maybe it's connected vertically? Let's check row 6: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0]. So row 6 has 5s at columns 5,6,7. Row 7's column 6 has a 5. So cell (7,6) is part of a vertical line? Because row 6, column 6 is 5. So cell (7,6) has a 5 above (row 6, column 6). So that 5 is part of a vertical line (rows 6 and 7, column 6) \u2192 output is 2? Wait, but in the output for Example 0's row 7, column 6 is 2. So cell (7,6) becomes 2, which is horizontal. Hmm, conflicting.\n\nWait, cell (7,6) in input has 5. Let's see:\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]\n\nSo in row 6, columns 6 and 7 are 5s. Row 7, column 6 is 5, but in row 7, column 6's neighbors are: left (5 in column 5?), but in row 7, column 5 is 0. So in row 7, column 6 is a single 5, but connected to row 6's column 6. So vertical connection. So why does it become 2? Because in output, it's 2. So this contradicts the previous idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the primary direction of the cluster. For example, if the cluster is more vertical (height > width), then 1; if more horizontal (width > height), then 2. For a cluster that's square, maybe 2? Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 0's 3x2 block (rows 2 and 3, columns 2-4). The height is 2, width 3. So width > height \u2192 horizontal cluster \u2192 output 2. That matches the output. \n\nIn Example 0's seventh row, the 5s in columns 1 and 2 (row 7) are part of a cluster that spans rows 7 and 8. Let's see the cluster's dimensions. The cluster in rows 7 and 8, columns 1-3. The height is 2 rows, width is 3 columns (since in row 8, columns 1-3). So width 3, height 2 \u2192 width > height \u2192 horizontal cluster \u2192 output 2? But in the output, they are 1s. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. This approach isn't working. Let's think differently. Maybe the output numbers represent the count of adjacent 5s in a certain direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each 5 is replaced by the number of its connected neighbors in a particular direction, like right and down. Wait, but how?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output again. The third row's 5s become 2s. Let's see if those 5s are in a horizontal line. Yes. So each 5 in that line has two neighbors (left and right). But why 2? Or maybe the number of adjacent cells in the same cluster, but that's not directly the case.\n\nAnother angle: looking at Example 2's input and output. For example, the first row input is [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5], output [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]. The first three 5s became 1s, and the last three became 2s. So the first three are a horizontal line of three, output 1s. The last three are also a horizontal line, output 2s. That's confusing. Wait, but in the output, maybe the first three 5s are part of a vertical structure? Looking at row 0, columns 0-2: 5s. Row 1, columns 0:0, but row 1 has 5s in columns 1 and 2. So maybe that's connected vertically? Row 0's column 1 is 5, row 1's column 1 is 5. So that's vertical. So perhaps the first three 5s in row 0 are part of a vertical structure, hence 1s, and the last three are part of a horizontal structure, hence 2s.\n\nBut how to determine that. Let's look at the entire cluster. The first three 5s in row 0 are connected to the 5s in row 1, columns 1 and 2. So the cluster is a sort of L-shape. But how does that translate to 1s and 2s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each 5 is replaced by 1 if it has a 5 above or below, and 2 if it has a 5 to the left or right. So vertical neighbors \u2192 1, horizontal \u2192 2. If a cell has both, maybe 1 takes priority? Let's check.\n\nTake Example 0's seventh row, column 1 (5). The cell below it (row 8, column 1) is 5. So vertical neighbor \u2192 1. The cell to the right (column 2) is 5. So horizontal neighbor. But since vertical exists, it's 1. That matches the output (1). \n\nIn row 7, column 6 (5). The cell above (row 6, column 6) is 5. So vertical neighbor \u2192 1? But output is 2. Wait, this contradicts. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait, row 6, column 6: input is 5. Its output is 2. Let's see. The cell in row 6, column 6: in input, it's part of a horizontal line (columns 5-7). So neighbors to the left and right. So according to the previous idea, horizontal \u2192 2. But the cell below it (row 7, column 6) is 5. So vertical neighbor as well. So if both, perhaps the cell's value is determined by both directions. But the output is 2. Maybe the horizontal direction takes precedence.\n\nAlternatively, the cell is considered to be part of a horizontal cluster if there's at least one horizontal neighbor, regardless of vertical. But then for cells that are part of both, how to decide. Maybe if any horizontal neighbor exists, it's 2, else 1.\n\nBut in row 7, column 6 (5), the cell has a vertical neighbor above (row 6, column 6 is 5), but no horizontal neighbors in row 7. So it's only vertical \u2192 1. But in the output, it's 2. So that contradicts.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of another approach. Perhaps the output is determined by the presence of a vertical or horizontal \"stroke\" in the cell. For example, a vertical line (cells stacked vertically) become 1, horizontal line (cells in same row) become 2. Even if part of a larger block, each cell is determined by the direction of the line it's part of. But how to define that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the minimal enclosing rectangle of the cluster. If the cluster's width is greater than height, it's horizontal (2), else vertical (1). For example:\n\nIn Example 0's 3x2 block (rows 2-3, columns 2-4). The width is 3, height 2. So width > height \u2192 horizontal \u2192 2.\n\nIn Example 0's seventh and eighth rows, columns 1-3. Width is 3 (columns), height 2 (rows). Width > height \u2192 horizontal \u2192 2. But in the output, those cells are 1s and 1s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output may alternate between 1 and 2 based on some other factor. For example, the parity of the cluster's size or position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a count of the number of 5s in a certain direction. For example, each cell becomes the count of consecutive 5s to the left and right (for horizontal) or above and below (for vertical). But how to apply that.\n\nLooking at Example 0's third row: [0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is 2s. If the count of consecutive 5s horizontally is 3, maybe each cell in that run gets a 2. But why 2? Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is 1 for vertical connections and 2 for horizontal, but each cell can belong to multiple clusters, but the highest priority is given to vertical. So if a cell is part of both a vertical and horizontal cluster, it's considered vertical (1). But I need to see examples.\n\nIn Example 2's input first row: [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5]. Output is [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]. The first three 5s are connected to row 1's 5s in columns 1 and 2, forming a vertical connection. So they are 1s. The last three 5s are part of a horizontal line, so 2s. \n\nIn row 1 of Example 2's input: [0,5,5,0,5,5,0,5,0,0]. Output [0,1,1,0,1,1,0,2,0,0]. The 5s in columns 1 and 2 are part of a vertical group (row 0's columns 1 and 2 are 5s?), but row 0's columns 1 and 2 are 5s (from first row input). So cell (1,1) is connected to cell (0,1) which is 5. So vertical \u2192 1. Similarly, cells (1,4) and (1,5) are 5s. Their row above (row 0, columns 4 and 5 are 0). So no vertical connection. But they are horizontal \u2192 2? But output is 1. Wait, no. The output for cells (1,4) and (1,5) are 1 and 1. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to look for another pattern. Let's check if the output numbers are related to the number of neighboring 5s in a certain direction.\n\nIn Example 0, row 2, cell 2 (5) becomes 2. Neighbors: same row cells 3 and 4 (5s), rows 1 and 3. Row 1, cell 2 is 0. Row 3, cell 2 is 5. So one vertical neighbor (below). So maybe the output is 1 + number of vertical neighbors. But 1+1=2. So that cell becomes 2. For a cell with no vertical neighbors, output is 1. For two vertical neighbors, output is 3? But I don't see that in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 1 if the cell has at least one vertical neighbor, 2 if it has horizontal neighbors but no vertical. So:\n\n- Cell with vertical neighbor (above or below) \u2192 1.\n- Cell with horizontal neighbor (left or right) but no vertical \u2192 2.\n- Cell with both \u2192 1 (vertical takes priority).\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample 0's row 2, cell 2: has a vertical neighbor below (row 3, cell 2). So output 1. But in the output, it's 2. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nIf the cell has any vertical neighbor (above or below), output 1.\n\nIf not, but has horizontal neighbor, output 2.\n\nIf no neighbors, output 1 (as in isolated cells).\n\nWait, Example 0's row 2, cell 2 (5) has a vertical neighbor (row 3, cell 2). So output 1. But the output is 2. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This isn't working. Maybe the pattern is different. Let's try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nThe two 5s in row 7, columns 1 and 2 become 1s. The 5 in row 7, column 6 becomes 2. \n\nLooking at their neighboring 5s:\n\nFor row 7, column 1 (5): neighbors are row 7, column 2 (5) (horizontal), and row 8, column 1 (5) (vertical). So both vertical and horizontal. Output is 1. \n\nFor row 7, column 6 (5): neighbors are row 6, column 6 (5) (vertical), and row 7, column 5 (0) and column 7 (0). So only vertical. Output is 2. That contradicts the previous idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 1 if the cell has a vertical neighbor below it, and 2 if it has a horizontal neighbor to the right. Let's test:\n\nRow 7, column 1 (5): has vertical neighbor below (row 8, column 1). So 1.\n\nRow 7, column 2 (5): vertical neighbor below (row 8, column 2). So 1.\n\nRow 7, column 6 (5): vertical neighbor above (row 6, column 6). So 1? But output is 2.\n\nHmm, no. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: Each 5 is replaced by the number of consecutive 5s in the horizontal direction, capped at 2. But in Example 0's row 2, three 5s \u2192 each would be 3, but output is 2. So capped at 2. Similarly, a single 5 becomes 1. But then in Example 0's row 6, two 5s \u2192 each becomes 2. That matches. In row 7, two horizontal 5s \u2192 2 each. But in the output, they are 1s. So this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the number of connected 5s in the horizontal direction, but the output is 1 for vertical and 2 for horizontal. \n\nWait, perhaps the output is 2 if the cell is part of a horizontal run of two or more, and 1 otherwise. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's row 2 has a horizontal run of three \u2192 all become 2. Which matches.\n\nExample 0's row 7, columns 1 and 2: horizontal run of two \u2192 output 2. But in the output, they are 1. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if a cell is part of a vertical run (two or more vertically connected), output 1. Otherwise, if part of horizontal run, output 2. So:\n\nIn Example 0's row 7, columns 1 and 2 are part of a vertical run (with row 8's columns 1 and 2). So output 1. The horizontal run in row 6 (columns 6 and 7) are part of a horizontal run \u2192 output 2. That seems to fit.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Any cell that is part of a vertical run (two or more cells stacked vertically) becomes 1.\n- Any other cell that is part of a horizontal run becomes 2.\n- Isolated 5s (no vertical or horizontal runs) become 1.\n\nBut then in Example 1's first row, the last column is 5. Isolated. So output 1. Which matches.\n\nIn Example 0's row 7, column 6: is there a vertical run? Cell (7,6) has a 5 above (row 6, column 6). So a vertical run of two \u2192 output 1. But in the output, it's 2. So this is a problem.\n\nWait, cell (7,6) in Example 0's input is 5. Cell (6,6) is 5 (part of row 6's horizontal run). So there's a vertical run of two (rows 6 and 7, column 6). According to the rule, this should be 1, but the output is 2. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. This suggests the rule is more complex. Maybe vertical runs are only considered if they are two or more cells in height. For example, if a cell has a cell above and/or below, then it's part of a vertical run and becomes 1. Else, if part of horizontal run, becomes 2.\n\nBut in cell (7,6) of Example 0, it's part of a vertical run (two cells). So should be 1. But the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is challenging. Let's try another approach. Maybe the output is based on the position of the cell within the cluster. For example, in vertical clusters, the top cell is 1, the bottom cells are 1. In horizontal clusters, leftmost is 2, etc. But I don't see how this applies in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the number of 5s in the same row or column. For example, a row with multiple 5s becomes 2, a column with multiple 5s becomes 1.\n\nLooking at Example 0's row 2, which has three 5s. So output 2. Column 2 in rows 2 and 3 has 5s. So output 1. But the output for row 2, column 2 is 2, not 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nPerhaps the output is a combination of both. For example, if a cell is in a row with other 5s, it's 2; if in a column with other 5s, it's 1. But then how to prioritize if both are true.\n\nIn Example 0's row 7, column 1: the cell is in a row with other 5s (column 2) and in a column with other 5s (row 8). So both, which takes priority? Output is 1. So perhaps column takes priority. So if a cell is part of a column with at least one other 5, output 1. Otherwise, if part of a row with others, output 2.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample 0's row 2, column 2: part of column 2 (has 5s in rows 2 and 3), so output 1. But output is 2. So no.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output is the sum of the vertical and horizontal adjacency counts, with 1 for vertical and 2 for horizontal. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the shape of the cluster. For example, every time there's a new cluster, assign 1 or 2 in a certain way, but that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output numbers: in Example 0, the first cluster (rows 2-3, columns 2-4) are 2s. The cluster in rows 6-7 columns 6-7 are 2s. The cluster in rows 7-8, columns 1-3 are 1s. The cluster in rows 8, columns 1-3 are 1s. So maybe clusters are alternately labeled 1 and 2 based on some order. But how to determine the order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 1 for clusters that are connected vertically to another cluster, and 2 otherwise. But I don't see a clear pattern.\n\nAt this point, perhaps I should try to manually process the test input and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]\n[0,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]\n[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n[0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n[0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nLet's try to apply the possible pattern where vertical clusters become 1 and horizontal 2.\n\nLooking at the first two rows of test input:\n\nRow 0: [0,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]\n\nThe 5s in columns 1-2 and 6-7 for both rows. These form vertical pairs between rows 0 and 1. So each of these cells is part of a vertical cluster (two rows high). So according to earlier hypothesis, these would become 1s. The 5s in columns 6-7 also form a vertical cluster between rows 0 and 1. So these would be 1s. But let's see what happened in Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1's first row, the last column is 5. It's in row 0, column 8. The row above (none) and below (row 1, column 8 is 5). So it's part of a vertical cluster. Output is 1. Which fits.\n\nIn the test input, the first two rows' 5s are in vertical clusters. So output should be 1s. The 5s in columns 6-7 of rows 0 and 1 would become 1s. \n\nNow, row 2 of test input: [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,0,0,0]. The first four 5s form a horizontal line. The next two are horizontal (columns 5-6). So according to the pattern, these would become 2s. \n\nRow 4: [0,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]. The 5s in columns 1-2 are part of a vertical cluster (rows 4 and 5). So 1s. The 5 in column 7 is part of a vertical cluster (rows 4-7). So output 1.\n\nRow 5: [0,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0]. The 5s in columns 1-4 form a horizontal line \u2192 2s. Column 7's 5 is part of vertical cluster \u2192 1.\n\nRow 8: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0]. The 5s in columns 1-5 are horizontal \u2192 2s.\n\nPutting this together, the output should have 1s for vertical clusters and 2s for horizontal.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow 0 and 1's columns 1-2 and 6-7 are vertical clusters \u2192 1s.\n\nRow 2's first four columns are horizontal \u2192 2s. Columns 5-6 (5s) are horizontal \u2192 2s.\n\nRow 4's columns 1-2: vertical \u2192 1s. Column 7: vertical (rows 4-7) \u2192 1.\n\nRow 5's columns 1-4: horizontal \u2192 2s. Column 7: vertical \u2192 1.\n\nRows 6 and 7's column 7: vertical \u2192 1.\n\nRow 8's columns 1-5: horizontal \u2192 2s.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\nRow 0: [0,1,1,0,0,0,2,2,0,0] \u2192 Wait, no. Because rows 0 and 1's columns 6-7 are vertical between rows 0 and 1. So they should be 1s. So row 0, columns 6 and 7: 1s.\n\nBut row 2, columns 6-7 are 5s. Wait, the test input's row 2 is [5,5,5,5,0,5,5,0,0,0]. So columns 5 and 6 are 5s. So horizontal \u2192 2s.\n\nWait, putting it all together for each cell:\n\nLet's process each cell in the test input:\n\nRow 0:\n\nColumns 1-2: 5s. Since in rows 0 and 1, vertical cluster \u2192 1s.\n\nColumns 6-7: 5s. Also in rows 0 and 1 \u2192 vertical \u2192 1s.\n\nSo row 0's output: [0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0].\n\nRow 1's output: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2:\n\nColumns 0-3: 5s (horizontal) \u2192 2s.\n\nColumn 5-6: 5s (horizontal) \u2192 2s.\n\nSo output row: [2,2,2,2,0,2,2,0,0,0].\n\nRow 3: all zeros \u2192 same.\n\nRow 4:\n\nColumns 1-2: vertical with row 5's columns 1-2. So rows 4 and 5's columns 1-2 have 5s. So vertical \u2192 1s.\n\nColumn 7: 5. It's part of a vertical cluster in rows 4,5,6,7 \u2192 1.\n\nRow 4 output: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0].\n\nRow 5:\n\nColumns 1-4: horizontal \u2192 2s.\n\nColumn 7: vertical \u2192 1.\n\nOutput: [0,2,2,2,2,0,0,1,0,0].\n\nRow 6:\n\nColumn 7: vertical (rows 4-7) \u2192 1.\n\nOutput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0].\n\nRow 7:\n\nColumn 7: vertical \u2192 1.\n\nOutput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0].\n\nRow 8:\n\nColumns 1-5: horizontal \u2192 2s.\n\nOutput: [0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow 9: all zeros.\n\nBut wait, comparing this to the training examples, especially Example 1 and Example 2, there are cases where vertical clusters have 1s and horizontal have 2s. However, in the test input, the first two rows' 5s in columns 1-2 and 6-7 are vertical between rows 0 and 1, so they should be 1s. The 5s in row 2 are horizontal, so 2s.\n\nBut in Example 1's first row, the 5s in columns 1-2 are part of a vertical cluster (rows 0 and 1 in Example 1's input). Wait, looking back at Example 1's input:\n\nExample 1's input row 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,0]\n\nRow 2: [5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nSo the 5s in row 1, columns 1-2 are connected to row 2, columns 0-3. So they are part of a larger cluster. The output for these cells is 2. Which contradicts the previous pattern. So maybe there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 1 for vertical clusters that are exactly two cells tall, and 2 for others. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAfter struggling with various hypotheses, I think the correct pattern is that each 5 cell is replaced by 1 if it's part of a vertical cluster (two or more cells stacked vertically), and 2 if it's part of a horizontal cluster (two or more cells in a row), with vertical taking priority. Isolated cells (no vertical or horizontal neighbors) become 1.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow 0, columns 1 and 2: part of a vertical cluster (rows 0 and 1), so 1.\n\nColumns 6 and 7: part of vertical cluster (rows 0 and 1), so 1.\n\nRow 2, columns 0-3: horizontal cluster \u2192 2.\n\nColumns 5-6: horizontal \u2192 2.\n\nRow 4, columns 1-2: vertical cluster (rows 4 and 5) \u2192 1.\n\nColumn 7: vertical cluster (rows 4-7) \u2192 1.\n\nRow 5, columns 1-4: horizontal \u2192 2.\n\nRow 8, columns 1-5: horizontal \u2192 2.\n\nThus, the output should be:\n\n[0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n[0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0]\n[2,2,2,2,0,2,2,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n[0,2,2,2,2,0,0,1,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n[0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut wait, in Example 1's row 1, the first two 5s are part of a vertical cluster with row 2's 5s. So why do they become 2 in the output? Maybe the pattern is different. For example, if a cluster has both vertical and horizontal parts, it's considered a horizontal cluster if the width is larger than height. Otherwise vertical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 1 for vertical clusters and 2 for horizontal, but a cell can only belong to one type. This is getting too time-consuming, and I need to provide an answer. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the pattern that vertical clusters become 1 and horizontal become 2, and apply it to the test input as above.",
