        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output matrices in the training examples and then apply that pattern to the test input. Let me start by carefully examining the training examples to identify any consistent changes between the input and output.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the input and output are mostly the same except for certain rows. For instance, in row 12 of the input (0-indexed?), the input has [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, ...], and the output changes that row to include 1s and another 4. Specifically, the output row 12 becomes [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,...]. Similarly, in row 13 of the input, which has 4s at positions 11 and 13, the output adds 1s around them, turning into [0,...,1,4,1,4,1,...]. This pattern of inserting 1s around 4s seems to be a key part of the transformation.\n\nIn Example 1, similar changes occur. For instance, in the input's row 13, there's a 4 in the output row, and the output adds 1s around it. The rows that have 4s in the input get transformed by surrounding those 4s with 1s. Also, the 4s themselves remain, but they're now part of a block of 1s and 4s. It looks like whenever there's a 4, the surrounding cells (maybe in a certain pattern) are converted to 1s, forming a cross or a plus shape around the 4. Wait, looking at Example 0's row 12, the 4 is at position 4, and the output has a horizontal line of 1s from positions 10 to 14. Maybe the pattern is that whenever a 4 is present, a horizontal line of 1s is added around it, or perhaps a cross.\n\nWait, looking more closely at Example 0's output row 12: input row 12 has a 4 at position 4, and the output row 12 has a sequence of 1s starting at position 10. That seems a bit far. Alternatively, perhaps the transformation is adding a horizontal line of 1s (length 5) centered around each 4. Let's check the positions. In Example 0's output row 12, the 4 is at index 4, and the 1s are from index 10 to 14. That's a bit far. Hmm, maybe not directly adjacent. Wait, maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's output, rows 12-16 (0-indexed) have a block of 1s and 4s. The input for those rows had 4s in certain positions, and the output seems to create a 5-cell horizontal line (like 1s) with possible 4s in the middle. For instance, output row 12 has [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,...]. The 1s are a horizontal line starting at position 10. The 4 in the input is at position 4. Wait, that's not adjacent. Maybe there's a different connection here.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is that whenever a 4 is present in a certain row, a horizontal line of 1s (length 5) is added somewhere else in that row. But how to determine where? Alternatively, maybe the 4s in the input are acting as markers to generate a certain pattern of 1s and 4s in the output. Alternatively, maybe the output is adding a cross around each 4. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 3's input, row 8 has [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and the output row 4 (maybe a typo in the example) shows [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,...]. Wait, maybe the 4 in row 8's input triggers the addition of 1s in row 4's output. That's possible, but how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input, which has several rows with sequences of 1s and 4s. For example, the first three rows of the test input have sequences like [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,...], which might be transformed by adding 4s in certain positions. Wait, in the training examples, the output seems to have 4s either retained from the input or introduced in certain positions, and 1s forming blocks around them. Maybe the pattern is that wherever there's a 4 in the input, in the output, a 3x3 cross (or similar) of 1s is placed around it, and existing 1s are left as is. Or perhaps 4s are part of a larger structure made of 1s.\n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output matrices for each example and see where the changes occur. Let's take Example 0. The input and output are the same except for rows 12-16. Let's look at row 12: input has a 4 at position 4 (0-based). The output row 12 has 1s from position 10 to 14 (indices 10-14). But that's a stretch. Maybe the 4's position in the input corresponds to a horizontal line of 1s in the same row but shifted. Alternatively, maybe the presence of 4s in a column triggers adding 1s in certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the same as the input, except that whenever a 4 is present in a column, a horizontal bar of 1s is added in the same row, but that doesn't fit Example 0's row 12. Alternatively, maybe each 4 in the input generates a horizontal line of five 1s centered around it. But in Example 0's row 12, the 4 is at position 4, and the 1s start at position 10. That's not centered. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the 1s are added in the same row but in a specific pattern relative to the 4. For instance, in Example 3's input, the first row has a 4 at position 2. The output's first row has 1s around it: [0,1,4,1,1,1,0,...]. So it's like replacing the 4 with a 1, but keeping the 4 and adding 1s around it. Wait, no. The input row 0 in Example 3 is [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output row 0 is [0,1,4,1,1,1,0,...]. So the 4 is at position 2. The output has 1s in positions 1,3,4,5. That's a pattern where the 4 is surrounded by 1s on the left, right, and two to the right. Wait, maybe it's a horizontal line of 5 cells with the 4 in the center. Let's see: the 4 is at position 2. The 1s are at positions 1,3,4,5. Wait, that's not exactly five. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the 4 is part of a block of 1s and 4s arranged in a cross shape.\n\nWait, perhaps whenever a 4 is present in the input, the output places a 3x3 cross (like a plus sign) of 1s around it, but in some cases, the 4 is at the center. For example, in Example 3's first output row, the 4 is at position 2, and the cells to the left (position 1), right (position 3), and further right (positions 4 and 5) are 1s. That doesn't form a perfect cross. Alternatively, maybe it's a horizontal line of 5 cells: the 4 is in the third position, and there are two 1s to the left and two to the right. So positions 0-4: but in Example 3's output row 0, the 1s are at positions 1,3,4,5. So that's not exactly a centered 5-cell line. Maybe the pattern varies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s in the input are part of regions that are expanded into larger blocks of 1s and 4s in the output. For instance, in Example 3's input row 8, there's a sequence of 1s and 4s. The output row 8 has more 1s and 4s arranged around them. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me try to find a general rule. Looking at the changes from input to output in the training examples, it seems that certain rows are modified by adding blocks of 1s and sometimes 4s. The key seems to be that whenever there's a 4 in a column, the output introduces a horizontal bar of 1s (and possibly 4s) in that column's vicinity. Alternatively, the 4s might act as centers for certain patterns.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0's output, rows 12-16 have a structure where 1s form horizontal lines with 4s embedded. For instance, row 12 has 1s from index 10-14, with the original 4 at index 4. But how does that connect? Maybe the 4 in row 12's input (index 4) is being used to generate a horizontal line of 1s starting at index 10. That seems arbitrary. Perhaps there's a vertical component. For example, the 4 in row 12's input is in column 4. Then, in the output, columns around 4 have 1s added in certain rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that whenever a 4 is present in a row, a horizontal sequence of 1s is placed in the same row, with the 4 possibly in the middle. For example, in Example 3's input row 0, there's a 4 at column 2. The output row 0 has 1s in columns 1,3,4,5 and the 4 remains at column 2. That forms a pattern like 1,4,1,1,1. So a 4 followed by 1s to the right and one to the left. Maybe the rule is that each 4 in the input is replaced with a sequence of 1s and 4 such that the 4 is surrounded by 1s on both sides and extends for a certain length.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn Example 3's input row 0: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, ...] becomes [0,1,4,1,1,1, ...]. So the 4 is followed by three 1s to the right and one to the left. So the pattern here is that a 4 in the input is converted into a block of 1s surrounding it. The 4 is at position 2. The output has 1s at 1,3,4,5. So left of the 4 is 1, then 4, then three 1s to the right. That's a total of five cells: 1,4,1,1,1. So perhaps the rule is that each 4 in the input generates a 5-cell horizontal block where the 4 is the second cell, followed by three 1s, and preceded by one 1. But this seems to vary.\n\nLooking at Example 0's row 12 input: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,...]. Here, the 4 is at position 4, and the 1s start at position 10. That's a distance of 6 cells. That doesn't fit the previous pattern. So maybe there's another rule here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4 in the input is part of a vertical line, and the output adds horizontal lines at certain positions. For example, in Example 0's input row 12, there's a 4 in column 4. In the output, starting from row 12, there are 1s in columns 10-14. Maybe columns 10-14 in row 12 correspond to the 4's column in some way. But I'm not seeing the connection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves adding horizontal lines of 1s and 4s in the output wherever there are 4s in the input, but offset by a certain number of rows or columns. For example, a 4 in column x of row y in the input might lead to a horizontal line starting at column x + 6 in row y. But this seems arbitrary without more examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output adds a 5-cell horizontal block of 1s wherever there's a 4 in the input, but placed at a certain offset. For Example 0's row 12, the 4 is at column 4, and the 1s are at columns 10-14. That's a difference of 6 columns. In Example 3's row 0, the 4 is at column 2, and the 1s start at column 1 (but that's left, so maybe the offset isn't fixed). This approach might not hold.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the test input. The first three rows have sequences of 1s. For instance, row 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,...]. The output for this might involve adding 4s in certain positions. Maybe the pattern is that horizontal lines of 1s in the input are converted into cross-shaped patterns with 4s in the center. For example, a row of five 1s in the input becomes a row with 1s and a 4 in the middle. Let's check the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input row 8: [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], output row 4 (maybe row 4 in the output?) has [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,...]. Not sure. Alternatively, in Example 0's input row 1: [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,...], output is the same. So rows with 1s and 4s are preserved. But in Example 0's row 12, the input has a 4 and the output adds 1s elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that whenever a 4 is present in a column, the corresponding column in the output gets a horizontal line of 1s in the same row. For example, if a 4 is in column x, then in the output row, columns x-2 to x+2 are set to 1, with the 4 remaining. But checking Example 3's input row 0, which has a 4 in column 2, the output has 1s in columns 1,3,4,5. That's not exactly x-2 to x+2 (columns 0-4). But maybe it's a different range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output inserts a 5-cell block of 1s in the same row where a 4 is present, but shifted. For instance, in Example 0's row 12, the 4 is in column 4, and the 1s start at column 10. That's a shift of 6 columns. But why 6? It's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s in the input are part of a larger grid that's transformed into a cross or other shape in the output. For instance, each 4 in the input is the center of a 3x3 cross in the output. But looking at Example 3's output row 0: the 4 is at column 2, and the 1s are to the left and right. Maybe it's a horizontal line of 5 cells (the 4 in the center). But in that row, the cells are 0,1,4,1,1,1. That's 4 in the third position (index 2), and 1s to the left and right. So perhaps a horizontal line of 5 cells with 4 in the center. But the line is not exactly 5 cells long. Or maybe it's variable-length.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that each 4 in the input is replaced with a horizontal sequence of 1s, with the 4 itself remaining in the center. So for example, a 4 in column x would result in 1s in x-2, x-1, x+1, x+2, and the 4 at x. That would form a 5-cell horizontal line with 4 in the center. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 3's input row 0, the 4 is at column 2. Applying this rule, the output should have 1s at columns 0,1,3,4 and 4 at 2. But the output is [0,1,4,1,1,1, ...]. So columns 1,3,4,5 have 1s. That doesn't fit. Maybe the rule is different. Perhaps it's a 3-cell line: 1,4,1. But in Example 3's row 0, the output has 1,4,1,1,1. So more to the right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4 acts as a seed for generating a specific pattern of 1s and 4s. For example, each 4 in the input generates a horizontal line of 1s of length 5, with the 4 at a specific position within that line. But in Example 0's row 12, the 4 is at column 4, and the 1s start at column 10. That's a separation of 6 columns. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to create a 5-cell horizontal block of 1s in the same row, but shifted a certain number of columns relative to the 4's position. For instance, if a 4 is present in column x, then the output adds a block of 1s starting at column x + 6. But why 6? It might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output adds a horizontal line of 1s and 4s wherever there's a 4 in the input, but in a way that these lines overlap with existing 1s. For example, in rows that already have 1s in the input, the output adds 4s in certain positions. But this is speculative.\n\nWait, looking back at Example 0's output row 12, the 1s are in columns 10-14, forming a horizontal line of 5 1s. The input row 12 has a 4 in column 4. Perhaps the 4's column is multiplied by 2 to get the starting column of the 1s (4*2=8, but the 1s start at 10). Not quite. Or 4+6=10. So maybe the offset is 6 columns. Then, for any 4 in column x, a horizontal line of 1s is added starting at x+6. But why?\n\nThis seems arbitrary. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's check other examples. In Example 3's input row 0, the 4 is at column 2. In the output, the 1s start at column 1. 2-1=1, so not a fixed offset. \n\nAlternatively, the number of 1s added depends on the position of the 4. For example, the 4's column modulo something. This is getting too vague.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps the 4s in the input are used to generate cross-shaped patterns in the output. For each 4 in the input, a cross (horizontal and vertical lines) of 1s is created around it. But looking at the examples, this doesn't seem to fit. For instance, in Example 0's row 12 input has a 4 at column 4. The output row 12 has a horizontal line of 1s starting at column 10, but no vertical lines. So maybe only horizontal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s in the input are part of a larger grid that's being transformed into a grid where each 4 is part of a horizontal bar of 1s and 4s. For example, a 4 in the input could become the center of a 5-cell horizontal block in the output, with 1s surrounding it. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 3's input row 0: 4 at column 2 \u2192 output row 0: 1,4,1,1,1. That's 5 cells, with the 4 in the second position. So it's a horizontal bar starting at column 1, length 5, with the 4 in the middle.\n\nIn Example 0's input row 12: 4 at column 4 \u2192 output row 12 has 1s from column 10-14 (5 cells). So the 4 is not in the center. Wait, that's conflicting. Unless there's a different rule for certain cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal bar is placed at a fixed distance from the 4. But why in Example 3 it's adjacent and in Example 0 it's six columns away?\n\nThis is perplexing. Maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a 4 in the input, the output adds a horizontal block of 1s and 4s in the same row, but the position depends on other factors. Alternatively, maybe the 4s are part of a cellular automaton-like rule where surrounding cells are turned into 1s.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the test input's first few rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,...] \u2013 five 1s in a row.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,1,4,1,1,1,0,...] \u2013 has a 4 in column 5 and in column 10.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,...] \u2013 five 1s.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,4,1,4,1,0,...] \u2013 4s in columns 6, 10, and 12.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,...] \u2013 4 in column 3 and five 1s.\n\nIn the training examples, the output often replaces sequences of 1s with patterns that include 4s. For example, in Example 0's output row 12, the 1s are added where there were none in the input. But wait, in Example 3's input row 8, there's a 4 and in the output row 8, there's a horizontal line of 1s. So perhaps the 4s are used to generate horizontal lines of 1s in the same row, and existing 1s are left as-is. But then why in the test input's first row, which has five 1s, would the output change?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is twofold: \n\n1. Any existing 4 in the input remains in the same position in the output.\n2. For each 4 in the input, a horizontal bar of 1s is added to the output in the same row, centered around the 4's column. For example, a 4 at column x would result in a 5-cell horizontal bar from x-2 to x+2, converting those cells to 1s (except the 4's position).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with Example 3's first row. Input has a 4 at column 2. The output has 1s in columns 1,3,4,5. According to the rule, the bar should be from 0 to 4 (columns 0,1,2,3,4). But the output has 1s at 1,3,4,5. The 4 is at 2, and the 1s are at 1,3,4,5. This doesn't fit the hypothesis. Alternatively, maybe the bar is 5 cells starting at the 4's column. So 4 is the first cell, then four 1s. But that would give 4,1,1,1,1. But in the example, it's 1,4,1,1,1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bar is placed to the right of the 4. For example, a 4 at column x generates 1s from x to x+4. In Example 3's row 0, x=2, so 2 to 6. But the output has 1s from 1 to 5. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the differences between input and output in each example.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- Rows 12-16 in the input have 4s scattered. The output adds horizontal bars of 1s in those rows. For example, row 12 in the output has a bar of 1s starting at column 10.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\n- Rows 13-17 in the output have horizontal bars of 1s and 4s where the input had 4s in certain columns.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\n- The first three rows of the input have 4s, and the output adds horizontal bars with 1s and 4s around them.\n\nThis suggests that the presence of a 4 in a column leads to the addition of a horizontal bar of 1s (and possibly 4s) in the same row, but shifted. The exact positioning is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each 4 in the input, the output places a horizontal bar of five 1s in the same row, with the 4 at the center. So, for a 4 at column x, the output sets columns x-2, x-1, x, x+1, x+2 to 1, except x remains 4. Let's check this:\n\nExample 3's input row 0 has a 4 at column 2. The output row 0 has [0,1,4,1,1,1, ...]. So columns 0-5 would be 0,1,4,1,1,1. That's five cells (columns 1-5), with the 4 at column 2. This fits the hypothesis: columns 0,1,2,3,4 would be x-2=0, x-1=1, x=2, x+1=3, x+2=4. But the output has 1s at columns 1,3,4,5. So column 5 is also 1. Hmm, that's not matching. So maybe the bar is longer. Or maybe it's a different rule.\n\nAnother example: Example 0's row 12 input has a 4 at column 4. The output row 12 has a bar of 1s from column 10-14. If the bar is five cells long, that's 10-14 (5 cells). So perhaps the 4's column is multiplied by 2 plus 2 (4*2 +2=10). That would make the bar start at column 10. But why this formula?\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let's look for the number of changes. For instance, in Example 0, the output introduces 1s in rows where there are 4s in the input, but not in the same columns. Maybe the 4s are part of a larger structure that spans multiple rows and columns.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is the same as the input, but for each 4 in the input, a certain pattern (like a horizontal line of 1s) is added at a fixed distance below or above. For example, a 4 in row r, column c causes a horizontal line of 1s in row r + k, columns c to c+4. But this also doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could involve mirroring or shifting the 4s to generate patterns. For instance, a 4 in column c leads to a horizontal line in the same row but mirrored around a certain axis. But I don't see a clear axis.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let's consider that the output adds horizontal blocks of 1s and 4s wherever there are 4s in the input, possibly in the same row but shifted. For example, each 4 in the input generates a 5-cell block of 1s in the same row, starting 6 columns to the right. This would explain Example 0's row 12. Similarly, in Example 3's row 0, the 4 at column 2 generates a block starting at column 8 (2+6=8), but in the output, it's at columns 1-5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4's column index determines the starting position of the 1s block using a certain formula, like (c * 2) + 2. For example, c=4 \u2192 (4*2)+2=10. Which matches Example 0's row 12. For Example 3's row 0, c=2: (2*2)+2=6. But the 1s start at column 1. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: the output's added 1s are in the same row but in columns that are multiples of 5. For example, in Example 0's row 12, the 1s start at column 10 (which is 5*2). In Example 3's row 0, the 1s start at column 1 (not a multiple of 5). So that doesn't help.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let's try to find another angle. Maybe the output is generated by some kind of convolution or kernel applied to the input. For instance, each cell in the output is determined by looking at the surrounding cells in the input. For example, if a cell in the input is a 4, then in the output, the cells to the left and right become 1s. But how far?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 4 with a 1 and placing a 4 in the center of a horizontal line of 1s. For example, if there's a 4 in column x, the output sets x-2 to x+2 to 1s, with x remaining as 4. But as seen in Example 3, this isn't the case. The 4 is at column 2, and the output has 1s at columns 1,3,4,5, but not 0 or 2+2=4. Wait, column 4 is part of the 1s. But why 5?\n\nAnother observation: in the test input, rows 0-4 have sequences of 1s and 4s. For example, row 0 has five 1s, row 1 has a 4 in column 5 and 10, and the 1s in columns 9-13. Maybe the output for row 0 would have those 1s replaced with a pattern that includes 4s in the middle. For example, the five 1s in row 0 could become 1,1,4,1,1, with the 4 in the center. That would fit with some of the training examples where 1s are replaced with 4s in the center. Let's check.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input row 1 has [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,...], and the output row 1 is the same. But in Example 3's input row 8 has 1s and the output adds 4s. So maybe the rule is that a horizontal sequence of five 1s in the input is replaced with 1,1,4,1,1. But in Example 0's input row 1, the five 1s remain unchanged. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of a 4 in the same column as a block of 1s in the input causes the center of that block to become a 4 in the output. For example, in the test input's row 0, there are five 1s in columns 9-13. If there's a 4 in one of those columns in another row, the center (column 11) becomes a 4. But in the test input, row 1 has a 4 in column 5 and 10. So perhaps the 4 in column 10 affects the row below or above.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the training examples.\n\nIn Example 3's input row 0, the 4 at column 2 leads to a horizontal bar of 1s with the 4 in the middle. So the output is 1,4,1,1,1. Perhaps the rule is that each 4 in the input generates a horizontal bar of 1s starting one cell to the left and extending four cells to the right, replacing existing cells. \n\nSimilarly, in Example 0's row 12, the 4 is at column 4, and the output adds 1s from column 10-14. Maybe the distance is determined by the column index: 4 * 2 + 2 =10. So 4*2 is 8, plus 2 is 10. That fits. For Example 3's row 0, the 4 is at column 2: 2*2 +2=6. But the output starts at column 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output adds a horizontal bar of 1s six columns to the right of each 4. So 4 in column x \u2192 bar starts at x+6. For Example 0's row 12, 4+6=10. Fits. For Example 3's row 0, 2+6=8, but the bar starts at column 1. Doesn't fit. So this is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the correct pattern is that for each 4 in the input, a horizontal bar of five 1s is added in the same row, starting six columns to the right. But this only fits Example 0.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll hypothesize that the pattern involves adding a horizontal bar of five 1s six columns to the right of each 4 in the input. Applying this to the test input:\n\nLooking at the test input's row 1, there's a 4 at column 5. Adding a bar starting at 5+6=11. So columns 11-15 would be 1s. The existing columns 9-13 have 1s and 4s. So perhaps the output will have 1s added there. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the test input's row 1 has a 4 at column 5 and 10. Adding bars six columns to the right would start at 11 and 16. But the output may have 1s in those regions.\n\nBut given the uncertainty, perhaps the correct approach is to look at the training examples and replicate the pattern of adding 1s around the 4s in the same row, possibly in a horizontal bar of five cells with the 4 in the center. For the test input's row 0, which has five 1s, perhaps the output keeps them as is. For rows with 4s, add 1s around them.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed to generate the test output by adding horizontal bars of 1s around the 4s in the same row. For example, each 4 in the input leads to a horizontal bar of five 1s centered on the 4 in the output. Existing 1s are left as is. This would mean replacing the 4 with a 4 and surrounding it with 1s.\n\nIn the test input's row 1, there's a 4 at column 5. So the output would have 1s at columns 3-7 (assuming a 5-cell bar), but column 5 remains 4. Similarly, another 4 at column 10 would add 1s from 8-12. Existing 1s in columns 9-13 may overlap.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,...] \u2192 remains the same.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,1,4,1,1,1,0,...] \u2192 The 4 at column 5 would create 1s from columns 3-7 (positions 3,4,5,6,7). The existing 4 at column 5 would stay. So columns 3 and 4 become 1, column 5 is 4, columns 6 and 7 become 1. Also, the 4 at column 10 would create 1s from 8-12. Existing 1s at 9-13 would overlap. So columns 8-12 would be 1s, with column 10 being 4. So row 1's output would be [0,0,0,1,1,4,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,1,0,...].\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,...] \u2192 remains the same.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,4,1,4,1,0,...] \u2192 4s at columns 6,10,12. Each would generate a 5-cell bar. For column 6: bars at 4-8 \u2192 1s. For 10: 8-12. For 12: 10-14. So overlapping regions would have 1s and 4s.\n\nThis approach seems to align with some training examples. For example, Example 3's input row 0 has a 4 at column 2, which in the output becomes 1s around it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer would involve adding such horizontal bars around each 4 in the test input.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I notice that the input and output matrices are mostly the same, but there are some changes where certain numbers are replaced. Let's compare the input and output for each example.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some 4s scattered around, and in the output, there are new 1s added around some of the 4s. For instance, in row 12 of the input, there's a 4, and in the output, that row now has a sequence of 1s around it. Similarly, row 13 in the input has some 4s, and the output adds 1s around them, forming a cross or a diamond shape.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has some 4s, and the output again introduces 1s around them. For example, in the input's row 6, there's a 4, and the output's row 6 has 1s around it. The same pattern follows in other rows where 4s are present. It seems like whenever there's a 4, the surrounding cells (up, down, left, right, and maybe diagonals) are turned into 1s if they are 0 in the input.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a cluster of 4s and 1s. In the output, around the 4s, there are 1s added. For example, in the third row, there's a 4, and the output adds 1s around it. Also, existing 1s might form a structure where 4s are centered, and the 1s create a sort of diamond or cross shape around them.\n\nExample 3 shows a similar pattern. The input has 4s and some 1s. The output adds more 1s around the 4s. For example, the first row in the input has a 4, and the output adds 1s adjacent to it, forming a small diamond shape. Also, existing 1s are expanded around the 4s.\n\nPutting this together, it looks like the transformation rule is: for every 4 in the input, replace the surrounding cells (immediate neighbors, possibly including diagonals) with 1s, but only if those cells were originally 0. Existing 1s and other numbers remain the same unless a 4 is adjacent, in which case they might be part of the diamond shape around the 4. The 4s themselves stay in place, but their neighboring 0s become 1s.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's look at each row and see where the 4s are. For each 4, check its neighboring cells. If they are 0, change them to 1. Let's process each row step by step.\n\nLooking at the test input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2013 No 4s here, so no change.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2013 There's a 4 at position 5 and 10. For the 4 at 5, the neighbors (positions 4,6, and the row above and below) need to be checked. Similarly for the 4 at 10. The existing 1s around them might stay, but adjacent 0s become 1s. So around position 5 (row 1, column 5), the cells to the left (4) is 0, so becomes 1. The right (6) is 0 \u2192 1. The row above (row 0, columns 4,5,6) \u2013 row 0's column 5 is 0 \u2192 1. The row below (row 2, column 5) is 0 \u2192 1. Similarly, for the 4 at column 10 in row 1, check neighbors. The existing cells around it are 1s and a 4. So any adjacent 0s would become 1s.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2013 No 4s here.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2013 4s at column 6, 10, 12. For each 4, check neighbors. For example, the 4 at column 6 in row 3: neighbors above (row 2, column 6 is 0 \u2192 1), below (row 4, column 6 is 0 \u2192 1), left (column 5) is 0 \u2192 1, right (column 7) is 0 \u2192 1. Similarly for other 4s.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2013 4 at column 3. Neighbors: left (2) 0 \u2192 1, right (4) 0 \u2192 1, up (row3, column3) 0 \u21921, down (row5, column3) 0 \u21921.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2013 4 at column14. Neighbors: left (13) 0 \u21921, right (15) 0 \u21921, up (row4,14) 0 \u21921, down (row6,14) 0 \u21921.\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2013 4 at column10. Neighbors: up (row7,10) 0 \u21921, down (row9,10) 0 \u21921, left (9) 0 \u21921, right (11) 0 \u21921.\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0] \u2013 4s at column5 and 19. For column5: neighbors left (4) 0 \u21921, right (6) 0 \u21921, up (row8,5) 0 \u21921, down (row10,5) 0 \u21921. For 4 at 19: neighbors left (18) 0 \u21921, right (20) 0 \u21921, up (row8,19) 0 \u21921, down (row10,19) 0 \u21921.\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2013 4s at column8 and13. For column8: neighbors left (7) 0 \u21921, right (9) 0 \u21921, up (row9,8) 0 \u21921, down (row11,8) 0 \u21921. For 13: neighbors left (12) 0 \u21921, right (14) 0 \u21921, up (row9,13) 0 \u21921, down (row11,13) 0 \u21921.\n\nRow11: [0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0] \u2013 4s at columns3,5,18. Each of these will have their neighbors turned to 1s where possible.\n\nRow16: [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0] \u2013 4s at 0,7,18. Their neighbors will get 1s.\n\nRow20: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2013 4s at 6 and 8. Neighbors around them.\n\nRow21: [0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2013 4s at 1 and 6. Their neighbors.\n\nSo applying this, each 4 in the test input will have their immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) converted to 1s if those cells are 0. Let's check each occurrence and modify accordingly.\n\nFor example, in row 1, the 4 at column5: the cells around it in the same row are columns4 and6, which are 0s. So those become 1. The cell above (row0, column5) is 0 \u21921, and below (row2, column5) is 0 \u21921. So row0, column5 becomes 1. Row1, columns4 and6 become 1. Row2, column5 becomes 1.\n\nSimilarly, the 4 in row1, column10: existing cells around it are 1s (left is 1, right is 1), so those remain. The cell above (row0,10) is 1, so no change. The cell below (row2,10) is 1. So no changes here.\n\nIn row3, the 4 at column6: left is column5 (0 \u21921), right is column7 (0 \u21921). Up (row2,6 is 0 \u21921), down (row4,6 is 0 \u21921). So those cells become 1.\n\nProceeding like this for all 4s. Now, let's reconstruct the output step by step.",
