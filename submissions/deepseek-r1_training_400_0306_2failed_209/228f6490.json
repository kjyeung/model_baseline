        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input matrices into the output ones based on the training examples. Let me start by looking closely at each example to see what's changing.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has numbers like 7, 5, 6, 8. The output seems to modify some regions. For instance, in the third row, the [0,5,0,0,5,5,0,6,6,0] becomes [0,5,8,8,5,5,0,0,0,0]. So the 6s turned to 0s and the 0s inside the 5 structure became 8s. Similarly, in the eighth row, the 8s become 0s, and some 0s near 5s turn into 6s. Maybe it's about filling enclosed areas with a different number, replacing certain digits when they form a closed shape?\n\nLooking at Example 1. The input has 5s, 9s, 3s, etc. In the output, the 9s in the second row are replaced with 0s, and the 3s in the first row's inner part (where there were 0s) are filled with 3s. Similarly, in the seventh row, the 0s around the 5 become 9s. Hmm, maybe it's about detecting enclosed regions (like the outline of a number, say 5) and replacing the inner 0s with another number. Or perhaps replacing the surrounding numbers when they form a border.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 6s and 8s in the input are replaced with 0s in the output, but in the third and fourth rows, the 0s inside the 5s are replaced with 8s. So maybe when there's a closed loop of a certain number (like 5s forming a border), the 0s inside are filled with another number. But how is the fill number determined?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has regions of 2s, 4s, etc. The output replaces some 0s with 8s and 2s. For example, in the second row of input, [2,2,2,0,5,0,0,0,5,5] becomes [0,0,0,0,5,8,8,8,5,5]. The 2s in the first rows are turned into 0s, and the 0s inside the 5 structure are filled with 8s. Similarly, in the seventh row, the 0s between 5s are filled with 2s. So perhaps the fill number is determined by the number that's surrounding the enclosed area. Like, if a 5 forms a closed loop around 0s, those 0s are filled with another number, maybe from the surrounding or adjacent numbers. Wait, in example 0, the 8s inside the 5s: the 8s in the input are elsewhere, but in the output, the filled number is 8. But where does the 8 come from? Maybe the fill number is the number that's adjacent to the enclosing structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a number that's present elsewhere in the matrix but not part of the enclosing structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that when a number (like 5) forms a closed loop (like a rectangle or a border), the 0s inside that loop are replaced with another number. The replacement number could be the number that is adjacent to the loop's exterior. For example, in example 0, the 5s form a loop, and the 0s inside are filled with 8. Wait, in the input of example 0, the 8s are in rows 8 and 9. Maybe the replacement number is determined by the number that's outside the loop. Let me check.\n\nIn example 0, the filled 8s in rows 2 and 3. The surrounding 5s form a sort of U-shape. The 8s in the input are in rows 8 and 9. Maybe when the loop is closed, the 0s inside are filled with the number that's adjacent to the loop in a certain direction. Hmm, this is getting a bit vague.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where numbers change from input to output. For example, in Example 0's input row 2: [0,5,0,0,5,5,0,6,6,0]. The output row 2 is [0,5,8,8,5,5,0,0,0,0]. So the two 0s between the 5s are filled with 8. Then the 6s in column 7-8 are replaced with 0s. Similarly, in row 8 of the input, there are 8s which become 0s in the output. So maybe the 6s and 8s in the input are being \"erased\" (replaced with 0) unless they are part of a filled region. Wait, but in the output, the filled regions (the 8s) are new. So perhaps the process is: for each enclosed area of 0s surrounded by a certain number, fill it with another number, and then remove some existing numbers (like 6s and 8s) that are not part of the main structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves two steps: first, filling enclosed regions of 0s with a certain number, and then replacing some other numbers (like 6 or 8) with 0s. But how to determine which number to use for filling?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The first row is [5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0], which becomes the same in the output. The second row input is [5,0,0,0,5,0,9,9,9,9], output is [5,3,3,3,5,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 0s between the 5s are filled with 3. Where does the 3 come from? The input has 3s in row 5 (3,3,3,0...). So maybe the fill number is taken from adjacent cells outside the enclosed area. For example, the 3s are adjacent to the 5s in some way. But in example 0's filled 8s, the 8s were present in other parts of the input. Maybe the fill number is a number that is present in the input but not part of the enclosing structure. Like, the 5s form the border, and the fill number is a number that's adjacent to the border but not part of it. For example, in Example 1's second row, the 5s in columns 0 and 4. The 3s are filled in the 0s between them. Looking at the input's row 5, there are 3s. But how would that connect? Maybe the fill number is the number that is adjacent to the enclosing structure's outer edge.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fill number is determined by looking at the surrounding cells. In Example 0's filled 8s: the area that's filled with 8 is surrounded by 5s. But in the input, the 8s are present in the lower rows. Maybe the fill number is the number that's present in the same row or column as the enclosed area but outside. For example, in row 2 and 3 of Example 0's input, the enclosed 0s are filled with 8. The 8s in the input are in rows 8 and 9, columns 1-2. That's not adjacent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the filled number is the same as the number in the adjacent cells outside the enclosing structure. For example, in Example 0's filled 8s: the 5s form the border. The cells adjacent to the enclosed area (but outside the border) might have 0s. So that doesn't explain the 8. Maybe the filled number is the minimum or maximum number in the input matrix. But in example 0, numbers include 0,5,6,7,8. The filled number is 8, which is the highest. But in Example 1, the filled number is 3, which is not the highest. So that's not consistent.\n\nAnother angle: in Example 0's input, the filled 0s (now 8) are in a region that's surrounded by 5s. Maybe the algorithm is to find all enclosed regions (contiguous 0s completely surrounded by a single number) and replace them with the number that is adjacent to that region's border. Wait, but the border is 5, so adjacent cells outside the border would be 0s (since it's enclosed by 5s). So that can't be. Alternatively, the fill number could be the number that's present in the cells adjacent to the enclosing structure but on the outside. But if the enclosing structure is surrounded by 5s, then the outside would be other numbers. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the fill number is determined by the number that's outside the enclosing structure. For example, in Example 0's row 2, the 0s are enclosed by 5s. But outside the 5s, there are 0s. So that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the fill number is the number that's adjacent to the enclosing structure's perimeter. For example, if the enclosing structure is made of 5s, and adjacent to those 5s are another number, but that seems not to be the case here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the filled number is a new number that's the sum or some function of the surrounding. But that's unclear.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output. The input's first two rows have 2s. The output's first row becomes all 0s except the 5s. The second row's 2s are turned into 0s, and the 0s inside the 5s are filled with 8s. Then, in the seventh row of the input, there are 0s between 5s which are filled with 2s in the output. So maybe the fill number depends on the surrounding numbers outside the enclosing structure. For instance, in the first filled case (row 2 of example 2 input), the 0s are surrounded by 5s. The filled number is 8. Where is 8 present in the input? In row 8 and 9, columns 6-8. Not adjacent. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's based on layers. For example, the outermost regions are filled first with a certain number, and inner regions with others. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for the numbers that are removed (replaced with 0) in the output. In Example 0, the 6s and 8s in the input are replaced with 0s. In Example 1, the 9s and some 3s are replaced. In Example 2, 2s and 8s are replaced. So perhaps any number that's not part of a contiguous block (like along the edges) is replaced with 0. But how to determine which numbers get replaced.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers that are replaced are those that form small clusters or are not part of the main structures. For example, in Example 0's input, the 6s are in row 2, columns 7-8. In the output, they are replaced with 0. The 8s in row 8-9 are replaced with 0, but the filled 8s in the middle remain. So maybe certain numbers are being replaced unless they are part of a filled area. Or maybe the numbers are replaced if they are adjacent to 0s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves two steps: (1) fill enclosed regions of 0s with a certain number, and (2) remove certain numbers (like 6, 8, 9, etc.) by replacing them with 0. The fill number might be determined by the number that is present in the input but not part of the enclosing structure, perhaps the next available number in the matrix.\n\nBut how to determine the fill number. Looking at Example 0: the enclosed area is filled with 8. The 8s in the input are in rows 8 and 9. Maybe the fill number is the lowest number present in the input that is not part of the enclosing structure. In Example 0, the enclosing number is 5, and other numbers are 0,6,7,8. The lowest is 6, but the fill number is 8. That doesn't fit. Maybe the fill number is the highest available number. In Example 0, 8 is the highest (excluding 7 and 5). Example 1's filled number is 3. The input has 3,5,6,9. The highest is 9, but filled number is 3. So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother possibility: the fill number is the same as the number that's adjacent to the enclosing structure. For example, if the enclosing structure is made of 5s, and the fill number is the number that is adjacent to the 5s in the input. But in Example 0's row 2, the enclosed 0s are surrounded by 5s. The adjacent cells outside the 5s would be 0s. So that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the fill number is the number that's adjacent to the enclosing structure's other side, like in the row or column. For example, if the 5s form a border, maybe the fill number is found by looking at the first non-zero number in a certain direction from the enclosed area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fill number is derived from the enclosing number. Like 5 \u2192 5+3=8 (but why 3?), 5\u21923? Example 0 has 5 filled with 8, Example 1 has 5 filled with 3, Example 2 has 5 filled with 8 and 2. That doesn't follow a clear pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the filled 3s are in the region enclosed by 5s. In the input, there's a 3 in row 5. Maybe the fill number is the first non-zero number encountered when moving outward from the enclosing structure. For example, in the second row of Example 1's input, the enclosed 0s are surrounded by 5s. If we move upwards from that row, the first non-zero is 5. If we move downwards, the next rows have 0s, then 3s. So maybe the fill number is the first non-zero number found in a specific direction (like up, then left, etc.), but this seems too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the fill number is the number that appears in the same position in the input but in a different layer. Not sure.\n\nLet me look for another pattern. In Example 0's output, the 8s in the filled area correspond to the 8s in the input's lower rows being erased. So maybe the filled number is the same as the number that is being erased elsewhere. For example, in Example 0, the 8s in the input's lower rows are turned to 0s, and the filled region uses 8. So it's like moving the 8s from one place to another. Similarly, in Example 1, the 3s in the input's fifth row are replaced with 0s (or not?), and the filled area uses 3. Wait, in Example 1's input, row 5 is [3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,0,0]. The output for row 5 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0]. So the 3s are replaced with 0, but the filled area in row 2 uses 3. So it's like the 3s are moved from row 5 to the filled area. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the filled number is the same as the number that is being erased in other parts of the matrix. For example, in Example 0, the 8s are erased from rows 8-9 and filled in rows 2-3. In Example 1, the 3s are erased from row 5 and filled in row 2. In Example 2, the 2s in the first rows are erased and filled in row 7. So maybe the pattern is: for each number that is being erased (turned to 0) elsewhere in the matrix, use that number to fill the enclosed regions. So the algorithm could be:\n\n1. Identify all enclosed regions of 0s surrounded by a single number (like 5).\n2. Find a number in the input matrix that is present in non-enclosed areas (like scattered 8s, 3s, 2s) and replace those with 0.\n3. Use that number to fill the enclosed regions.\n\nSo the process is: find numbers that are isolated (not part of the main structures), erase them (replace with 0), and use their value to fill the enclosed regions.\n\nIn Example 0, the 8s in rows 8-9 are erased (become 0), and their value (8) is used to fill the enclosed regions in rows 2-3. Similarly, the 6s in row 2 are erased and their value (6) is used to fill the enclosed regions in row 8 (the 0s near 5s become 6s). Wait, in Example 0's output, the row 8's output is [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,6,6,5]. So the 0s are filled with 6, which was present in row 2 of the input. But the 6s in row 2's input are erased (0s). So perhaps the number used to fill is taken from the same region where it's being erased. Or maybe the algorithm identifies certain numbers (like those forming small clusters) to be the fill numbers.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n- For each number in the input that is part of a small cluster (like the 8s and 6s in example 0), replace them with 0 in the output, and use their value to fill any enclosed regions in the matrix.\n\nBut how are the enclosed regions determined, and which number is used for filling which region.\n\nAlternatively, the enclosed regions are filled with the number that is being erased from the input. So, in example 0, the 8s are erased from rows 8-9 and used to fill the enclosed regions in rows 2-3. The 6s are erased from row 2 and used to fill the enclosed region in row 8.\n\nBut how does the algorithm decide which erased number to use for which enclosed region? Maybe it's based on proximity or order. For example, the first enclosed region found is filled with the first erased number.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to formalize the steps based on the examples.\n\nTake Example 1:\n\nInput has 9s in row 1-2, columns 6-9. These 9s are erased (replaced with 0s in the output). The filled region in row 7-8 is filled with 9s. So the 9s are erased from one place and used to fill another enclosed region.\n\nSimilarly, the 3s in row 5 are erased and used to fill the enclosed regions in row 1-2.\n\nSo the pattern might be:\n\n1. Identify all clusters of numbers (other than 0) that are not part of the main structure (like not the surrounding borders). These clusters are replaced with 0.\n\n2. For each enclosed region of 0s surrounded by a border of a particular number (like 5), fill it with the number from one of the erased clusters.\n\nBut how to decide which erased number to use for which enclosed region.\n\nAlternatively, the number used to fill an enclosed region is the same as a number that was present in the input but erased, and the choice is based on the enclosing border's number. Like, maybe the filled number is determined by the enclosing number modulo something, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the fill number is the smallest number present in the input that is not part of the enclosing structure. For example, in Example 0, the enclosing number is 5. Other numbers are 7, 6, 8. The smallest is 6, but the fill number is 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,2]\n\nRow 1: [2,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,5,5,0,5,5,4,4,4]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,2]\n\nRow 5: [7,7,7,0,0,2,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow 8: [0,2,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5]\n\nRow 9: [2,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nLooking for enclosed regions. For example, in row 1, the 5s are at positions 2 and 6. Between them, 0s. So maybe that's an enclosed region between 5s. In row 8, there's 5 at position 3 and 7-9. The 0s between them (positions 4-6) are enclosed by 5s. So those might be filled with a number.\n\nIn the training examples, the filled regions were enclosed by 5s and filled with numbers like 8, 3, 2, etc. Based on the previous examples, perhaps the numbers used for filling are those present in the input but in other parts. For example, in the test input, there are 2s, 4s, 7s. Let's see where they are.\n\nIn row 0, there's a 2 at the end. Row 1 has a 2 at the start. Row 5 has 2s at positions 5 and 7. Row 8 has a 2 at position 1. Row 9 has a 2 at position 0.\n\nSo perhaps the 2s in the input will be erased (replaced with 0) and their value used to fill enclosed regions. For example, the enclosed regions in row 1 (between 5s) might be filled with 2. Similarly, the enclosed regions in row 8 could be filled with 2 or another number.\n\nLooking back at Example 2, the 2s in the input's first rows were replaced with 0, and the enclosed regions in the lower part were filled with 2s. So maybe the same applies here.\n\nAnother possibility: each enclosed region surrounded by a certain number (like 5) is filled with the number that appears in the input but is not part of the enclosing structure. For example, if the enclosed area is surrounded by 5s, and the input has 2s, 4s, 7s, then the fill number is determined by which of those is present in the vicinity.\n\nAlternatively, the fill number is the number that is present in the input's row or column where the enclosed region is located. For instance, in the test input's row 1, the enclosed region is between 5s at columns 2 and 6. The row has a 2 in column 0. Maybe the fill number is 2.\n\nBut how to confirm.\n\nLooking at the test input's row 8: [0,2,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5]. The 0s between columns 3 and 7 (positions 4-6) are enclosed by 5s. So this region might be filled with a number. If the 2 in column 1 is erased and used to fill this area, that would be 2.\n\nIn the test input's row 5, there are 7s and 2s. The 7s are in the first three columns. Maybe those 7s are replaced with 0, and the 2s in row 5 are replaced with 0, then their values are used to fill enclosed regions.\n\nAlternatively, in the test input, the 7s form a cluster in rows 5 and 6. Perhaps these are replaced with 0, and their value (7) is used to fill some enclosed regions.\n\nBut in Example 0, the 7s were present in the first and eighth rows of the input. In the output, they remained. So maybe 7 is part of the main structure and not erased. So perhaps certain numbers are considered part of the main structure and not erased. The fill numbers are those that are part of smaller clusters.\n\nSo the process could be:\n\n- Identify clusters of numbers that are not connected to the main structure (like the borders) and replace them with 0. The numbers from these clusters are used to fill enclosed regions surrounded by the main structure's numbers.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the 3s in row 5 are a cluster that's replaced with 0, and the enclosed regions are filled with 3.\n\nIn the test input, the 2s appear in multiple places. The 2 in row 0, column 9; row 1, column 0; row 5, columns 5 and 7; row 8, column 1; row 9, column 0. Some of these might be considered small clusters. For example, the 2 in row 0 is isolated. The two 2s in row 5 are near each other. These clusters could be replaced with 0, and their value (2) used to fill enclosed regions surrounded by 5s.\n\nSimilarly, the 4s in row 2 (columns 7-9) might form a cluster that is replaced with 0, and their value (4) used to fill another region. Or maybe the 4s are part of a larger structure.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to see how the test input would transform.\n\nLooking at the test input's row 1: [2,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. The 5s at columns 2 and 6. The 0s between them (columns 3-5) are enclosed by 5s. If this region is filled with 2 (since the 2 in column 0 is part of a cluster that's erased), then the output for row 1 would be [0,0,5,2,2,2,5,0,0,0].\n\nRow 8: [0,2,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5]. The 0s between columns 3 and 7 (positions 4-6) are enclosed by 5s. Filled with 2: [0,0,0,5,2,2,2,5,5,5].\n\nThe 2s in the input would be replaced with 0, and their value used to fill these regions.\n\nThe 7s in rows 5 and 6. Row 5: [7,7,7,0,0,2,0,2,0,0]. If 7s are erased (replaced with 0), and perhaps their value used to fill another enclosed region. But where? Looking for enclosed regions surrounded by 7s. Not present. But maybe the 7s are part of a main structure and not erased. In Example 0, 7s are present in the input and remain in the output. So perhaps 7 is part of the main structure and not erased.\n\nThe 4s in row 2 (columns 7-9) are a cluster. If they are replaced with 0, maybe their value (4) is used to fill an enclosed region. Looking for regions surrounded by other numbers. For example, in row 7, all are 5s except the first three columns. Maybe an enclosed region surrounded by 5s.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's try to construct the output step by step.\n\nFirst, identify which numbers are to be erased (replaced with 0) based on the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the 6s and 8s (small clusters) are erased. In Example 1, the 9s and 3s are erased. In Example 2, the 2s and 8s are erased.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that numbers that are not part of large contiguous blocks are erased. For example, in Example 0, the 6s are a small cluster. The 8s are also a cluster. So these are erased. The filled areas use the erased numbers' values.\n\nSo in the test input:\n\n- The 2s are present in multiple small clusters. For example, row 0 has a single 2. Row 1 has a 2. Row 5 has two 2s. Row 8 has a 2. Row 9 has a 2. These might all be considered small clusters and thus erased. The value 2 would be used to fill enclosed regions.\n\n- The 4s in row 2, columns 7-9: three 4s. If this is a small cluster, they would be erased. Their value 4 would be used to fill an enclosed region.\n\n- The 7s in rows 5-6: row 5 has three 7s, row 6 has one. If this is considered a cluster, perhaps they are erased. But in Example 0, 7s remained. Maybe 7s are part of a main structure. In the test input, the 7s are in rows 5-6, which may form a larger structure (like a horizontal line), but they are not connected to other 7s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, any number that is adjacent to a 0 or part of a small cluster is erased.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to apply the pattern to the test input.\n\nAssuming that all 2s in the input are small clusters and thus replaced with 0. Then, any enclosed regions surrounded by 5s would be filled with 2.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow 1: [2,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 erase the 2, then fill the enclosed 0s between the 5s (columns 3-5) with 2 \u2192 becomes [0,0,5,2,2,2,5,0,0,0].\n\nRow 8: [0,2,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5] \u2192 erase 2, fill the enclosed 0s (columns 4-6) with 2 \u2192 becomes [0,0,0,5,2,2,2,5,5,5].\n\nRow 9: [2,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5] \u2192 erase the 2 \u2192 [0,0,0,5,...].\n\nRow 5: [7,7,7,0,0,2,0,2,0,0] \u2192 erase the 2s \u2192 [7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nThe 4s in row 2 (columns 7-9) are a cluster of three. Perhaps they are erased and replaced with 0. Then, any enclosed regions surrounded by other numbers would be filled with 4. But where? Looking at row 2: [0,0,5,5,0,5,5,4,4,4] \u2192 after erasing 4s, becomes [0,0,5,5,0,5,5,0,0,0]. Is there an enclosed region here? The 0 in column 4 is between 5s. So that might be filled with 4. But the 4s were erased, so maybe it's filled with 4. But according to the pattern, since the 4s are erased, their value is used for filling. So the 0 in column 4 would become 4. But how?\n\nBut in row 2, the 0 at column 4 is between two 5s. So it's an enclosed region. If filled with 4, the row becomes [0,0,5,5,4,5,5,0,0,0].\n\nSimilarly, in row 3: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0]. Are there enclosed regions? The 0s at columns 0-1 and 7-9. These are not enclosed by 5s. So no filling there.\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]. All 5s except first three columns. No enclosed regions.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,2]. The 2 is erased, and the 0s at columns 0-1 and 7-8. Not enclosed.\n\nRow 0: [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,2]. The 2 is erased. The 0s at the start and end are not enclosed by 5s. So no filling.\n\nRow 5: after erasing 2s and 7s, becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, but in Example 0, the 7s were not erased. So perhaps 7s are part of the main structure. Let's re-examine Example 0's input. The first row has 7s at the end, and they remain in the output. So maybe 7s are considered part of the main structure and not erased. So in the test input, the 7s in rows 5-6 may remain. But in Example 0's input, the 7s are in rows 0, 8-9. In the output, they remain. So the 7s are not erased. So in the test input, the 7s in rows 5 and 6 would remain, and their clusters are not erased. So the 7s in row 5 (three in a row) and row 6 (one) might be part of a larger structure and thus not erased.\n\nBut in row 5 of the test input, the 7s are followed by 0s and 2s. So they might form a horizontal line, but not connected to other 7s. If they are considered a main structure, they remain. Otherwise, they are erased. But this is unclear.\n\nAssuming that the 7s are not erased, the row 5 would become [7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But in the output examples, sometimes numbers like 7 are kept. So perhaps the 7s remain, and the 2s in row 5 are erased.\n\nNow, the filled regions would be:\n\n- Row 1, columns 3-5 filled with 2.\n\n- Row 8, columns 4-6 filled with 2.\n\n- Row 2, column 4 filled with 4 (since the 4s are erased and their value used).\n\nBut how to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, the 4s in row 2 are erased, and any enclosed regions surrounded by 5s are filled with 4. For example, row 2's column 4 is a single 0 between 5s. So filled with 4.\n\nSimilarly, row 5's 0s between the 7s and 2s? Not sure. The 0s in row 5, columns 3-4 and 5-9. Not enclosed by any number.\n\nPutting it all together, the test input's output would have:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,5,2,2,2,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,5,5,4,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,5,2,2,2,5,5,5]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nThe other rows would have their 2s and 4s replaced with 0s. The 7s remain. The 0s in row 5's columns 3-4 are not enclosed, so remain 0. The 0s in row 6 remain 0.\n\nSo the output for the test input would look like:\n\n[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n[7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5]\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. Let me compare with the training examples.\n\nIn Example 2's output, the filled regions surrounded by 5s are filled with 8 and 2. For example, in row 1 of the output, [0,0,0,0,5,8,8,8,5,5]. The 8 comes from the erased 8s in the input. So maybe in the test input, the 4s are erased and their value is used to fill enclosed regions. So row 2's column 4 0 is filled with 4.\n\nThe 2s are erased and used to fill the enclosed regions in rows 1 and 8.\n\nThis seems plausible. So the final output would replace all 2s and 4s with 0, and fill the enclosed regions surrounded by 5s with 2 and 4 respectively.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in the training examples, filled regions are contiguous and surrounded by the same number. For example, in Example 0, the filled 8s are in a 2x2 block. In the test input's row 1, the enclosed region is three 0s between two 5s. So they would be filled with 2.\n\nSo putting it all together, the output should be as I outlined earlier.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a 10x10 grid of numbers, and the output is another grid. My job is to see how the input is transformed into the output and apply that to the test input.\n\nFirst, let's look at Example 0. The input has numbers like 7, 5, 6, 8. The output changes some of those. For instance, in the third row of Example 0's input, there's a 6 in columns 7 and 8, but in the output, those become 0s, and in row 8, the 8s turn into 0s, but a 6 appears. So maybe it's replacing certain numbers based on their position or surrounding?\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has 9s in some rows, and in the output, those 9s are replaced with 0s except in rows 7 and 8 where they become 9s again. Wait, no. Wait, in the input, the second row has 9s, and in the output, those are replaced with 0s. But in rows 7 and 8 of the output, there's 9s again. Hmm. Maybe it's about enclosed areas? Like, if a number is surrounded by another number, it gets replaced?\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each number in the input is being replaced by a different number based on some rule. But looking at Example 0, the 5s mostly stay the same, but some 6s and 8s are replaced. Wait, in Example 0's input, the third row has 6s in columns 7 and 8. In the output, those are 0s. Then in row 8, the 8s become 0s, but a 6 appears in columns 7 and 8. So maybe there's some swapping or moving happening.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves filling in certain regions. For example, in Example 0's input, the third row had 5, 0, 0, 5, 5. In the output, those 0s turned into 8s. Similarly, in Example 1, the second row had 0s inside 5s that became 3s. So maybe when a number is part of a \"border\" and there's a zero inside, it's filled with another number.\n\nWait, maybe it's similar to a flood fill. For instance, in Example 1, the 5s form a sort of border, and the 0s inside are filled with 3s. Similarly, in Example 0, the 5s form a structure, and the 0s inside are filled with 8s. Then, the 6s and 8s in the input might be replaced by the fill number if they are inside a different structure.\n\nBut how does this determine which number to use for filling? Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the third row is part of a 5 structure. The 0s inside (positions [2][2], [2][3], etc.) are filled with 8 in the output. The 8 in the input is at rows 8 and 9, columns 1 and 2, which in the output become 0s. Wait, perhaps the 8 in the input is being used as the fill number for another area. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing certain regions (like holes) with the number that's adjacent. For example, in Example 1, the 9s in the input (rows 1 and 2) are replaced by 3s and 5s, but in the output, the 9s are only present in the lower rows. Maybe the numbers that are \"inside\" a larger structure are replaced by the number of the surrounding structure. So, the fill number is the same as the surrounding border.\n\nSo, for each enclosed area (a group of 0s surrounded by a single number), replace those 0s with the surrounding number. Wait, but in Example 0's third row, the 0s are replaced with 8, but the surrounding number is 5. So that contradicts that idea.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input, the third row has 0s between 5s. The output replaces those with 8. So maybe the fill number is different. Perhaps the fill number is determined by another part of the grid. For example, maybe the 8s in the input (rows 8 and 9) are being used as the fill number for the 0s in the 5 structure. Then, in the output, the 8s in their original position are turned into 0s, but the 0s inside the 5s are turned into 8s. So, the fill number is taken from another part of the grid, perhaps the first occurrence of that number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being shifted or moved. Like in Example 0, the 8s in the input are moved to fill the holes in the 5 structure, and the original 8s become 0. Similarly, the 6s in the input are moved to a different location.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the 6s are moved from row 2, columns 7-8 to row 8, columns 7-8. The original 8s in rows 8-9 are gone, replaced with 0s. The 8s are now in the filled area of the 5 structure. So maybe the 8s and 6s are swapping places. But how to determine which numbers are swapped?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fill number is the next number in some sequence. Like, if there's a 5 structure, the fill is 6, but in Example 0, the fill is 8. That doesn't fit.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has 9s in rows 1 and 2. The output replaces those with 0s, but in rows 7 and 8, the 9s are present. Wait, no. Wait in the input of Example 1, the 9s are in rows 1 and 2, columns 6-9. In the output, those 9s are replaced by 0s, but in rows 7 and 8, columns 4-7, there's 9s. How does that happen? Looking at the input's rows 7 and 8, there's a 5 structure. The 9s in the output's rows 7-8 might be filling holes in the 5 structure. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers that are filled into the holes are taken from other regions in the grid. For example, in Example 0, the 8s from rows 8-9 are moved into the holes of the 5 structure, and the 6s are moved down. Similarly, in Example 1, the 3s from the lower rows (rows 5-6) are moved into the 5 structure's holes, and the 9s are moved into another area.\n\nBut how to identify which number is used for filling? Let's look at Example 2's input and output. In the input's first two rows, there's 2s. In the output, those 2s are replaced with 0s, but in rows 7-8, columns 1-3, there's 2s. So maybe the numbers are being moved to fill the holes. So, the original 2s are moved to a different location where there's a hole, and the original location becomes 0.\n\nAlternatively, each number in the grid (except 0) is a \"border\" of a shape, and the 0s inside are filled with another number. The filling number seems to be a number that's present elsewhere in the grid. For example, in Example 0, the 8s are present in the input's lower rows, and those 8s are used to fill the holes in the 5 structure. Then, the original 8s are turned into 0s. Similarly, the 6s in the input's third row are turned into 0s, but appear in row 8. So perhaps the fill number is determined by the position where the original number was located, and after filling, the original number's position is cleared.\n\nThis seems complex. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, identify regions of 0s that are enclosed by a single number. For example, in Example 0, the 5 structure in row 2, columns 2-3 are 0s surrounded by 5s. Those 0s are filled with 8. Where does the 8 come from? In the input, there are 8s in rows 8-9. So maybe the fill number is the number that's present in the bottom part of the grid. Then, those 8s are removed from their original positions and placed into the filled areas.\n\nIn Example 1, the 5 structure in row 1 has 0s (columns 2-4) which are filled with 3. The 3s are present in row 5 of the input. So perhaps the fill number is taken from another part of the grid, perhaps the first occurrence of a certain number below or above.\n\nAlternatively, the fill number is the same as the number in the adjacent cell. But in Example 0, the filled 8s are surrounded by 5s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the fill number is determined by the next number in a sequence. For example, 5 is followed by 6, but in Example 0, 5 is filled with 8. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Let's compare input and output for each example to see the changes.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the third row has [0,5,0,0,5,5,0,6,6,0]. Output becomes [0,5,8,8,5,5,0,0,0,0]. So the 0s inside the 5s (positions 2 and 3) are filled with 8. The 6s (positions 7 and 8) become 0. Then, in row 8 of the input, which had [0,8,8,0,0,5,5,0,0,5], the output is [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,6,6,5]. So the 8s are replaced with 0s, and 6s are added there. So it seems like the 8s from the lower part are moved to fill the holes in the upper 5 structure, and the 6s from the upper part are moved to fill the lower holes.\n\nWait, maybe there's a swapping of numbers between regions. The 6s and 8s are moving to fill each other's regions.\n\nIn Example 1, the 9s in the upper part are replaced with 0s, and in the lower part, 9s appear. So perhaps the 9s from the top are moved to the lower part where there's a hole in the 5 structure. Similarly, the 3s in the input (row 5) are moved into the 5 structure's holes in the upper part.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For each enclosed area (hole) in a structure made of a certain number, fill that hole with a different number that exists elsewhere in the grid, and remove that number from its original position.\n\nSo the process could be:\n\n1. Identify all enclosed regions (holes) in the grid. A hole is a group of 0s completely surrounded by a single non-zero number (like 5).\n\n2. For each such hole, find a number in the grid that is not part of the enclosing number. This number is used to fill the hole.\n\n3. Replace the hole's 0s with this found number.\n\n4. Remove all occurrences of that number from their original positions, replacing them with 0.\n\nBut how to determine which number is chosen to fill the hole?\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nThe hole in the 5 structure (third row) is filled with 8. The original 8s are in rows 8-9, which become 0s in the output. So the 8 is taken from the lower part and used to fill the hole.\n\nIn Example 1, the hole in the upper 5 structure (row 1) is filled with 3. The 3s are present in row 5 of the input, and in the output, those 3s are gone (row 5 becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0]). So the 3s are moved to fill the hole and their original positions are set to 0.\n\nIn Example 2, the hole in the 5 structure (row 1, columns 5-7) is filled with 8. The 8s in the input are in row 8, columns 6-8. In the output, those 8s are replaced with 0s. So again, the 8s are moved to fill the hole.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each enclosed hole in a structure (surrounded by a single non-zero number X), find the smallest (or earliest occurring) number Y that exists elsewhere in the grid. Replace the hole with Y, and replace all instances of Y in the grid with 0.\n\nAlternatively, the number Y is the one that is present in the grid but not part of the enclosing structure. The first occurrence of Y in the grid is taken, and all Ys are removed and used to fill the holes.\n\nBut how is Y chosen? Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0, the hole is filled with 8. The original 8s are in rows 8-9, columns 1-2. So the 8 is taken from there. The 6s are in row 2, columns 7-8. But in the output, those 6s are moved to row 8, columns 7-8. So perhaps each hole is filled with a number from another part of the grid, and the original positions of that number are cleared.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the hole is filled with 8. The original 8s are in rows 8-9. In the output, those 8s are gone, and instead, the hole is filled with 8. So it's like the 8s are moved from their original position to fill the hole. Similarly, the 6s in row 2 are moved to row 8.\n\nThis suggests that numbers are being moved from their original positions to fill holes, and their original spots become 0.\n\nBut how to determine which number is moved where?\n\nAnother observation: In Example 0, the 8s are in the lower left (rows 8-9, columns 1-2). The hole they fill is in the middle of the 5 structure (rows 2-3, columns 2-3). The 6s are in row 2, columns 7-8, and in the output, they are in row 8, columns 7-8. So it's like the 8 and 6 are swapped in their positions. The 8 fills the hole, and the 6 moves down to where the 8 was.\n\nBut this swapping might not hold for other examples. Let's check Example 1:\n\nIn Example 1, the 3s in row 5 are moved to the hole in row 1. The original 3s (row 5, columns 0-2) become 0s. The hole is filled with 3. But then, the 9s in the input (rows 1-2, columns 6-9) become 0s, but in the output, there are 9s in rows 7-8, columns 4-7. So the 9s from the top are moved to a new hole in the lower 5 structure. So here, the 3s and 9s are moved into different holes.\n\nSo maybe each hole is filled by a number that's present in the input grid, and the original positions of that number are replaced with 0. The number chosen to fill the hole is the one that is closest to the hole or in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers used to fill the holes are the ones that are in the same row or column as the hole. But in Example 0, the hole is in row 2, and the 8s are in row 8. That's not close.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are used in the order of their value. For example, the smallest available number is used to fill the hole. But in Example 0, 8 is larger than 6, but it's used first. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the first hole encountered (in row-major order) is filled with the first available number (also in row-major order). Let's see:\n\nExample 0's first hole is in row 2, columns 2-3. The first non-5, non-zero numbers in the grid are 7, 0, etc. But the 8 is found later. So maybe the numbers are taken from the grid in order, and the first such number that isn't part of the enclosing structure is used.\n\nAlternatively, for each hole, look for numbers in the grid that are not part of the enclosing structure. Then use the smallest such number to fill the hole, and replace all instances of that number with 0.\n\nIn Example 0, the hole is enclosed by 5. The numbers present in the grid are 7,5,6,8,0. So the numbers not part of 5 are 7,6,8. The smallest is 6. But the hole is filled with 8, so this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's try another approach. Let's see for each example which numbers are used to fill the holes and what their original positions are.\n\nExample 0:\n\nHoles filled with 8 and 6.\n\nOriginal 8s are in rows 8-9, columns 1-2. Original 6s are in row 2, columns 7-8 and row 3, column 6.\n\nIn output, the 8s are moved to fill the hole in rows 2-3, columns 2-3. The original 8 positions are 0. The 6s are moved to rows 8-9, columns 7-8.\n\nSo the 8 and 6 swapped positions.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHoles filled with 3 and 9.\n\nOriginal 3s are in row 5, columns 0-2. Original 9s are in rows 1-2, columns 6-9.\n\nIn output, 3s fill the hole in row 1-2, columns 2-4. Original 3 positions are 0. The 9s are moved to rows 7-8, columns 4-7. Original 9 positions are 0.\n\nSo again, the 3 and 9 swapped positions.\n\nExample 2:\n\nHoles filled with 8 and 2.\n\nOriginal 8s in row 8, columns 6-8. Original 2s in rows 0-1, columns 0-2.\n\nIn output, the 8s fill the hole in row 1-2, columns 5-7. The original 8 positions are 0. The 2s are moved to rows 7-8, columns 1-3. Original 2 positions are 0.\n\nAgain, a swap between 8 and 2.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each hole in the input grid, the number used to fill it is a different number that exists elsewhere in the grid, and the positions of that number are set to 0. Moreover, the holes and the numbers being moved are paired in a way that the numbers are swapped between their original positions and the holes.\n\nBut how are the pairs determined? It seems like the first hole (in row-major order) is filled with the first number (in row-major order) that isn't part of the enclosing structure. Then, the next hole is filled with the next available number, etc.\n\nFor example, in Example 0, the first hole (row 2, columns 2-3) is filled with 8, which is the first non-5 number encountered in the grid (excluding the enclosing 5s). But in the input, the 8s are in lower rows. Maybe the numbers are chosen based on their position in the grid, like the first occurrence of a number not part of the enclosing structure.\n\nAlternatively, the holes are filled with the numbers that are located in the same relative position as the hole. But this is vague.\n\nAnother approach: Each hole is filled with a number that is present in the input grid, and the original positions of that number are cleared (set to 0). The numbers used to fill the holes are those that are not part of the enclosing structure. The filling starts from the top-left hole, and the numbers are taken in the order they appear in the grid (row-major), skipping numbers that are part of the enclosing structure.\n\nLet's check Example 0:\n\nHoles are in rows 2-3 (enclosed by 5). The numbers not part of 5 are 7,6,8. The first such number in row-major order is 7 (appears in row 0, columns 0,8,9). But the hole is filled with 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample 1: Hole in row 1, columns 2-4 (enclosed by 5). Numbers not part of 5 are 9,3,6. The first such number is 9 (row 1, column 6). But the hole is filled with 3. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the numbers used to fill the holes are the ones that are in the same region as the hole. For example, the hole is in a certain area, and the fill number is the number from another region.\n\nAlternatively, each number in the grid (other than 0) represents a shape, and the holes in each shape are filled with numbers from other shapes. The fill numbers are chosen based on their adjacency or proximity.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers used to fill the holes are those that are in the same row or column as the hole, but not part of the enclosing structure.\n\nIn Example 0, the hole is in row 2. The 8 is in row 8. Not the same. The 6 is in row 2. So perhaps the hole is filled with a number from the same row. But in this case, the 6 is in the same row but not used to fill the hole (it's filled with 8). So that's not it.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to see if there's a different approach.\n\nLooking at the output grids, the numbers that are filled into the holes seem to be the same as the numbers that were present in the input but in different positions, and those original positions are set to 0. It looks like the numbers are being \"moved\" into the holes.\n\nSo, the process could be:\n\n1. Identify all enclosed regions (holes) in the input.\n\n2. For each hole, select a number from the input that is not part of the enclosing structure of that hole.\n\n3. Replace the hole's 0s with that number.\n\n4. Set all occurrences of that number in the original grid to 0.\n\nThe selection of which number to use might be based on the order in which they appear in the grid (row-major), taking the first number encountered that isn't part of the enclosing structure.\n\nFor example, in Example 0:\n\nFirst hole is in row 2, columns 2-3 (enclosed by 5). The first non-5 number in the grid is 7 (row 0), then 0s, then 5s. The next non-5 number is 6 (row 2, column 7), then 8 (row 8). But the hole is filled with 8, which is the first occurrence of a number not part of the enclosing structure. Wait, 7 is not part of the 5 structure. But why is 8 chosen instead of 7?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are selected in the order of their value. For example, the smallest number first. But in Example 0, 6 is smaller than 8, but 8 is used. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are selected based on their proximity to the hole. But in Example 0, the 8 is far from the hole.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are taken from the input in the order they appear (row-major), and the first such number that is not part of the enclosing structure is used.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nThe numbers in row-major order are:\n\nRow 0: 7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n\nRow 1: 0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 2: 0,5,0,0,5,5,0,6,6,0\n\nRow 3: 0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 4: 0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 5: 0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,7,0\n\nRow 6: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 7: 0,0,0,0,7,5,5,5,5,5\n\nRow 8: 0,8,8,0,0,5,5,0,0,5\n\nRow 9: 0,8,8,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n\nSo the first non-5 numbers encountered after the hole are 7 (row 0), then 6 (row 2, column 7), then 8 (row 8). But the hole is filled with 8. So why 8?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are chosen from the bottom up. For example, the first non-5 number encountered when scanning from the bottom. Or perhaps the fill number is the last such number in the grid.\n\nIn Example 0, the 8 is the last non-5 number in the grid. And the hole is filled with 8. In Example 1, the hole is filled with 3, which is in row 5, which is earlier than the 9s which are in row 1-2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the fill number is the first number encountered after the hole's position in row-major order. For example, in Example 0's hole at row 2, column 2-3. After that position, the next non-5 numbers are 6 in row 2, column 7. So why is 8 chosen?\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the numbers 7, 5 remain in the same positions as the input. The 6 and 8 are moved. Similarly, in Example 1, the 5s, 6s, and 3s are moved. So perhaps the numbers that are in the same \"shape\" as their own structure are kept, while numbers that are isolated or in certain positions are moved to fill the holes.\n\nAlternatively, the fill numbers are those that are adjacent to the enclosing structure. For example, if a hole is surrounded by 5s, and there's a 8 adjacent to the 5s, the 8 is used. But in Example 0, the 8 is not adjacent to the hole.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output's filled numbers are present in the input, but their original positions are replaced with 0. So the fill number is taken from another part of the grid and moved to the hole. So the process is:\n\n1. Find all holes (enclosed 0 regions).\n\n2. For each hole, select a number Y that exists in the input (not part of the hole's enclosing structure).\n\n3. Replace the hole's 0s with Y.\n\n4. Replace all instances of Y in the input with 0.\n\nThe selection of Y could be based on the first occurrence of a number that is not part of the enclosing structure.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nExample 0:\n\nHole is enclosed by 5. Possible Y candidates are 7, 6, 8.\n\nThe first occurrence of non-5 numbers in row-major order:\n\nRow 0: 7, then 0s. So Y could be 7. But in the output, the hole is filled with 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Y is the first occurrence of a number that is not part of the enclosing structure and is not adjacent to other numbers of the same value. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, Y is the number that has the fewest occurrences in the input, but that's also not clear.\n\nAlternatively, Y is chosen based on the position of the hole. For example, if the hole is in the top half of the grid, Y is taken from the bottom half, and vice versa.\n\nExample 0's hole is in row 2 (top half), Y is 8 which is in the bottom half (rows 8-9). Example 1's hole is in row 1 (top), Y is 3 which is in row 5 (middle), and another hole filled with 9 in the lower part. Example 2's hole is in row 1 (top), filled with 8 from row 8 (bottom). So this seems consistent. The Y is taken from the opposite part of the grid.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\nFor each hole in the grid:\n\n- If the hole is in the top half (rows 0-4), use a number from the bottom half (rows 5-9).\n\n- If the hole is in the bottom half, use a number from the top half.\n\nThen, replace all instances of that number with 0.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample 0's hole is in row 2 (top), filled with 8 from rows 8-9 (bottom). Correct.\n\nExample 1's hole in row 1 (top) filled with 3 from row 5 (bottom half). Correct.\n\nAnother hole in Example 1's output is in row 7-8 (bottom), filled with 9 from rows 1-2 (top). So yes, the Y is taken from the opposite half.\n\nExample 2's hole in row 1 (top) filled with 8 from row 8 (bottom). Correct. Another hole in row 7 (bottom) filled with 2 from row 0-1 (top). Yes.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each enclosed hole:\n\n- Determine if it's in the top half (rows 0-4) or bottom half (5-9).\n\n- Select a number Y from the opposite half of the grid. This number must not be part of the enclosing structure of the hole.\n\n- Replace the hole's 0s with Y.\n\n- Replace all instances of Y in the input grid with 0.\n\nNow, how is Y chosen among multiple candidates in the opposite half? It could be the first occurrence (row-major) of a number in the opposite half that is not part of the enclosing structure.\n\nLet's verify with Example 0:\n\nHole in row 2 (top half). Opposite half is rows 5-9.\n\nLooking for the first number in rows 5-9 that is not 5 (since the hole is enclosed by 5).\n\nRow 5: 0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,7,0 \u2192 numbers are 0,5,7. 7 is not 5.\n\nRow 6: all 0s.\n\nRow 7: 0,0,0,0,7,5,5,5,5,5 \u2192 7.\n\nRow 8: 0,8,8,0,0,5,5,0,0,5 \u2192 8.\n\nRow 9: 0,8,8,0,0,5,5,5,5,5 \u2192 8.\n\nSo the first non-5 number in the opposite half is 7 in row 5. But in the output, the hole is filled with 8. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe the enclosing structure's number is ignored when choosing Y. For Example 0's hole, enclosed by 5. So Y must be a number not equal to 5.\n\nIn the opposite half (rows 5-9):\n\nRow 5 has 7 in column 8. Row 7 has 7 in column 4. Row 8 has 8. So the first occurrence of a non-5 number in the opposite half is row 5, column 8 (7). But in the output, the hole is filled with 8. So this approach doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the selection of Y is based on the first occurrence of a number in the opposite half that is not part of the enclosing structure and has the same value as another number in the grid that can fill the hole.\n\nAlternatively, Y is the first number encountered in the opposite half, regardless of the enclosing structure, but not part of the enclosing structure.\n\nBut in Example 0, the first non-5 number in the opposite half is 7 (row 5). But the hole is filled with 8. So why is 7 not chosen?\n\nWait, perhaps the Y is chosen based on the size of the hole. For example, the largest number in the opposite half is used.\n\nBut in Example 0, the opposite half has 7, 8. 8 is larger than 7, so 8 is chosen.\n\nExample 1's opposite half for the hole in row 1 (top) is rows 5-9. The numbers in the opposite half include 3,6,5,9. The first non-5 number is 3 (row 5, columns 0-2). So Y is 3, which is used to fill the hole.\n\nAnother hole in Example 1's output is in rows 7-8 (bottom half), so Y is taken from the top half. The top half has 5,9,3. The hole is enclosed by 5, so Y must be non-5. The first non-5 number in the top half is 9 (row 1). So filled with 9.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nSo the rule could be:\n\nFor a hole in the top half (rows 0-4), use the first non-enclosing number found in row-major order in the bottom half (rows 5-9). Replace all instances of that number with 0.\n\nFor a hole in the bottom half (rows 5-9), use the first non-enclosing number found in row-major order in the top half (rows 0-4).\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample 0:\n\nHole in row 2 (top half). Opposite half is rows 5-9.\n\nLooking for first non-5 number in row-major order in bottom half.\n\nRow 5: columns 0-9. The first non-5 numbers are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0. So 7 in column 8. But the hole is filled with 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. The bottom half starts from row 5.\n\nRow 5: [0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,7,0]. The first non-5 number is 0, but we need a non-zero number. So the first non-5 and non-zero number in row-major order is 7 in row 5, column 8. Then, row 7 has 7 in column 4, but row 8 has 8 in column 1. So in row-major order of the bottom half:\n\nRow 5, columns 0-9:\n\n0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,7,0 \u2192 non-zero and non-5 is 7 (position 5,8).\n\nRow 6: all 0s.\n\nRow 7: 0,0,0,0,7,5,5,5,5,5 \u2192 7 at column 4.\n\nRow 8: 0,8,8,0,0,5,5,0,0,5 \u2192 8 at column 1.\n\nSo the first non-5 and non-zero number in the bottom half is 7 (row 5, column 8). But in the output, the hole is filled with 8. So why is 7 not used?\n\nThis contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are chosen based on their value, preferring higher numbers. But in Example 0, 8 is higher than 7, and it's chosen.\n\nBut in Example 1, the hole in the top is filled with 3, which is lower than 9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are chosen based on the first occurrence of a number in the opposite half that can form a contiguous block in the hole. For example, the 8 in Example 0's bottom half is a contiguous block, and the hole is also a block of size 2x2. So maybe the size of the number's block is matched to the hole's size. In Example 0, the hole is 2x2, and the 8's block is 2x2 (rows 8-9, columns 1-2). So the 8 is chosen because its block size matches the hole's size.\n\nIn Example 1, the hole in the top is 3x1 (row 1, columns 2-4) but filled with 3, which in the input is a block of 3 in row 5. The hole in the bottom is filled with 9s which are a block of 4 in the input. The hole in the bottom is enclosed by 5 and is 4x2. So the size matches.\n\nExample 2's hole in row 1 is filled with 8, which in the input is a block of 3 (row 8, columns 6-8). The hole size is 3x1. Not sure. But the 8's original block is 3, and the hole is 3.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is:\n\nFor each hole, find a number in the opposite half that has a contiguous block size equal to the hole's size, and use that number to fill the hole. Replace all instances of that number with 0.\n\nBut this requires knowing the size of each hole and matching it to a number's block size. This could be possible.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample 0's hole in row 2-3, columns 2-3: a 2x2 hole. The 8s in the bottom are a 2x2 block (rows 8-9, columns 1-2). So matching size. Hence, 8 is chosen.\n\nExample 1's hole in row 1, columns 2-4: a 3 cells in a row. The 3s in row 5 are a block of 3 (columns 0-2). So size matches. Hence, 3 is chosen.\n\nAnother hole in Example 1's output is in rows 7-8, columns 4-7: a 2x4 block. The 9s in the input are a 2x4 block in rows 1-2, columns 6-9. So size matches. Hence, 9 is chosen.\n\nExample 2's hole in row 1-2, columns 5-7: a 3x2 area. The 8s in row 8, columns 6-8: a 1x3 block. Not exactly matching, but maybe the closest.\n\nAlternatively, the hole's size is not considered, but the number's block in the opposite half must have the same shape as the hole. This seems complicated.\n\nBut this approach explains why in Example 0 the 8 is chosen, and the 7 is not. The 7's block is single cells here and there, while the 8's block is 2x2, matching the hole.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\nFor each hole in the grid:\n\n1. Determine if it's in the top or bottom half.\n\n2. In the opposite half, find the first contiguous block of a number (not part of the enclosing structure) that has the same dimensions as the hole.\n\n3. Fill the hole with that number.\n\n4. Replace all instances of that number with 0.\n\nThis seems to fit the examples.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2]\n\nRow 1: [2, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 2: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4]\n\nRow 3: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 4: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2]\n\nRow 5: [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nRow 6: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 7: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n\nRow 8: [0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]\n\nRow 9: [2, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n\nFirst, identify the holes.\n\nLooking for enclosed 0s surrounded by a single number.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow 1, columns 3-5: 0s enclosed by 5. Let's check:\n\nIn row 1, columns 2 is 5, column 6 is 5. The rows above and below:\n\nRow 0, columns 3-5 are 5s. Row 2, columns 3-5: 5, 0, 5. So this area may not be fully enclosed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a vertical hole. Let's check:\n\nRow 1, columns 3-5: 0,0,0. They are surrounded by 5s on the left (column 2), right (column 6), top (row 0 columns 3-5 are 5), but the bottom (row 2 columns 3-5) is 5, 0,5. So the bottom isn't fully enclosed. So maybe this is not a hole.\n\nAnother possible hole: row 4, column 9 is 2. Not sure.\n\nLooking at row 2, columns 4: 0. Surrounded by 5s?\n\nRow 2, column 3 is 5, column 5 is 5. Row 1, column 4 is 0. So not enclosed.\n\nAnother possible hole in row 8, columns 5-7: 0,0,0. Surrounded by 5s.\n\nIn row 8, columns 4 is 0, but the surrounding rows and columns:\n\nRow 7, columns 5-7 are 5s. Row 9, columns 5-7 are 5s. Column 4 is 0 (row 8), column 8 is 5. So the zeros in row 8, columns 5-7 are surrounded by 5s on the top, bottom, and right, but the left is 0. So not enclosed.\n\nHmm. It's tricky to identify the holes. Let's try to look for enclosed 0s.\n\nAlternatively, look for regions of 0s that are completely surrounded by a single non-zero number.\n\nLooking at row 1, columns 3-5: 0,0,0. Surrounded by 5s on left (column 2), right (column 6), and top (row 0 columns 3-5 are 5), but the bottom (row 2, columns 3-5) is 5, 0,5. So the bottom has a 0 in column 4, so not fully enclosed by 5s. Hence, not a hole.\n\nAnother possible hole: row 4, columns 7-9: 0,0,2. Surrounded by 5s? Row 4, columns 2-6 are 5s. Column 7 is 0, columns 8-9 are 0 and 2. Not enclosed.\n\nAnother area: row 8, columns 5-7: 0,0,0. Surrounded by 5s on top (row 7, columns 5-7 are 5), bottom (row 9, columns 5-7 are 5), left (row 8, column 4 is 0), right (row 8, column 8 is 5). Not enclosed on the left.\n\nAnother possible hole: row 5, columns 3-4: 0,0. Surrounded by 7s in row 5, columns 0-2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, row 6, columns 3-6: 0s. Surrounded by 0s. Not enclosed.\n\nMaybe the test input's holes are:\n\nIn row 0-4 (top half):\n\nLooking for enclosed 0s. Perhaps in row 1, columns 1 and 8-9. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, look for a structure similar to the training examples. For example, in the test input, the 5s form a large structure in the top half. There's a possible hole in row 1, columns 3-5: three 0s. But again, not fully enclosed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the holes are in the bottom half. For example, row 8, columns 1-3: 2 and 0s. But not enclosed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test input's holes are:\n\nIn the bottom half (rows 5-9):\n\nRow 5: [7,7,7,0,0,2,0,2,0,0]. Columns 3-4: 0,0. Enclosed by 7s and 2s? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, row 5's 0s in columns 3-4 are between 7s and 2s. Not enclosed.\n\nIt's possible that the test input's holes are similar to the examples, requiring filling with numbers from the opposite half.\n\nAssuming there's a hole in the top half filled with a number from the bottom half, and vice versa.\n\nLooking at the test input, possible candidates:\n\nTop half (rows 0-4):\n\nRow 1, columns 3-5: three 0s. Maybe enclosed by 5s if the bottom is closed. Let's check row 2. Row 2, columns 3-5: 5,0,5. So in row 2, column 4 is 0. So the 0s in row 1, columns 3-5 are not fully enclosed.\n\nAnother possible hole: row 4, columns 7-8: 0,0. Surrounded by 5s on left (columns 2-6), but the right and bottom may not be.\n\nBottom half (rows 5-9):\n\nRow 5: columns 3-4 are 0s. Not enclosed.\n\nRow 8, columns 5-7: 0s. Surrounded by 5s on top (row 7), bottom (row 9), and right (column 8 is 5), but left (column 4 is 0). So not enclosed.\n\nRow 6, columns 1: 7. Not a hole.\n\nPerhaps the test input's holes are not obvious, but based on the examples, there must be some holes to fill.\n\nAlternatively, the test input has holes similar to Example 0 and Example 2, where the 5 structure has internal 0s.\n\nLooking at row 1, columns 3-5: 0,0,0. Surrounded by 5s on left (column 2), right (column 6), top (row 0 columns 3-5 are 5), but bottom (row 2 columns 3-5: 5,0,5). So only the middle column (4) has a 0 in row 2. So this area is not fully enclosed.\n\nAnother possible hole: row 2, column 4 is 0. Surrounded by 5s on all sides. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: column 4 is 0. So not enclosed.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to look for the same patterns as the examples.\n\nIn the training examples, the holes were enclosed by 5s and filled with numbers from the opposite half. Looking at the test input, the 5s are prevalent in rows 0-4 and 7-9.\n\nPossible holes in the 5 structures:\n\nIn row 1, columns 3-5: 0s. But as mentioned, not fully enclosed.\n\nIn row 8, columns 5-7: 0s. Surrounded by 5s on top (row 7), bottom (row 9), and right (column 8), but left is row 8, column 4 (0).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a hole in row 8's 5 structure. Row 8, columns 5-7: 0s. Surrounded by 5s in row 7 and 9, but not on the left and right.\n\nThis is getting too ambiguous. Perhaps I should proceed with the pattern observed earlier: holes are filled with numbers from the opposite half, and those numbers are replaced with 0.\n\nAssuming the test input has holes in the top and bottom halves:\n\nFor example, in the top half (rows 0-4), a hole is filled with a number from the bottom half (rows 5-9).\n\nLooking at the bottom half of the test input:\n\nRows 5-9:\n\nRow 5: 7,7,7,0,0,2,0,2,0,0.\n\nRow 6: 0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nRow 7: 0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5.\n\nRow 8: 0,2,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5.\n\nRow 9: 2,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5.\n\nThe non-5 numbers in the bottom half are 7, 2, 0.\n\nPossible candidates are 7 and 2.\n\nAssuming there's a hole in the top half (e.g., row 0-4), filled with 7 or 2 from the bottom.\n\nIf the hole is filled with 7, then all 7s in the bottom (rows 5-6) become 0.\n\nAlternatively, if filled with 2, then all 2s in the bottom (row 5, 8,9) become 0.\n\nSimilarly, for holes in the bottom half, numbers from the top half would be used.\n\nLooking at the test input's top half (rows 0-4):\n\nPossible holes. For example, row 0, columns 0-1 and 7-8: 0s. Are they enclosed? Row 0 has 5s starting from column 2. So maybe the 0s in columns 0-1 and 7-8 are part of the background, not enclosed.\n\nAlternatively, in row 4, columns 7-8: 0s. Surrounded by 5s on the left and right? Not sure.\n\nIt's possible that the test input has a hole in row 1, columns 3-5. Even though it's not fully enclosed, perhaps the pattern considers it as a hole. If that's filled with a number from the bottom half, say 7.\n\nThen, all 7s in the bottom half (rows 5-6) would become 0.\n\nSimilarly, another hole in the bottom half filled with a number from the top, like 2.\n\nThe test input's top half has 2s in row 0 (column 9), row 1 (column 0), row 4 (column 9).\n\nSo if a hole in the bottom half is filled with 2, then all 2s in the top would become 0.\n\nThis could explain the changes in the output.\n\nBut this is speculative. Let's try to construct the output based on this pattern.\n\nAssuming there are two holes:\n\n1. A hole in the top half (rows 0-4) filled with 7 from the bottom half.\n\n2. A hole in the bottom half filled with 2 from the top half.\n\nThe steps would be:\n\nFor the top hole:\n\n- Fill with 7 from the bottom (rows 5-6). Replace all 7s in the bottom half with 0.\n\nFor the bottom hole:\n\n- Fill with 2 from the top half. Replace all 2s in the top half with 0.\n\nBut how do the holes look?\n\nAssuming the hole in the top is row 1, columns 3-5 (0,0,0) filled with 7. Then, all 7s in the bottom (rows 5-6) become 0.\n\nThe hole in the bottom could be row 8, columns 5-7 (0,0,0) filled with 2. Then, all 2s in the top (rows 0,1,4) become 0.\n\nLet's see how this would look:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow 0: 0, 0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,2 \u2192 after replacing 2 with 0: 0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0.\n\nRow 1: 2,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0 \u2192 replace 2 with 0: 0,0,5,7,7,7,5,0,0,0.\n\nRow 2: 0,0,5,5,0,5,5,4,4,4 \u2192 no change (not part of 2 or 7 replacement).\n\nRow 3: 0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0 \u2192 no change.\n\nRow 4: 0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,2 \u2192 replace 2 with 0: 0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0.\n\nRow 5: 7,7,7,0,0,2,0,2,0,0 \u2192 replace 7 with 0: 0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0.\n\nRow 6: 0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 replace 7 with 0: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nRow 7: 0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5 \u2192 no change.\n\nRow 8: 0,2,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5 \u2192 replace 2 with 0 and fill the hole with 2: 0,0,0,5,2,2,2,5,5,5.\n\nRow 9: 2,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5 \u2192 replace 2 with 0: 0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this aligns with the examples' structure. The filled holes in the top and bottom would have the corresponding numbers.\n\nBut this is a guess. The actual answer might differ.\n\nAnother approach: Looking for the numbers that are present in the test input and could be used for filling.\n\nIn the bottom half (rows 5-9), the numbers are 7,2,5,0.\n\nIn the top half, numbers are 5,2,4,0.\n\nAssuming a hole in the top filled with 7 from the bottom, and a hole in the bottom filled with 2 from the top.\n\nThen:\n\n- All 7s in the bottom become 0.\n\n- All 2s in the top become 0.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nRow 0: 0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0 (since original 2 is replaced).\n\nRow 1: 0,0,5,7,7,7,5,0,0,0 (filled hole with 7).\n\nRow 5: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 (original 7s and 2s replaced).\n\nRow 8: 0,0,0,5,2,2,2,5,5,5 (filled hole with 2).\n\nBut this is just a guess. The actual answer requires applying the pattern observed in the training examples.\n\nAfter this extensive analysis, the final answer would involve:\n\nFor each hole in the test input, fill it with a number from the opposite half, then replace all instances of that number in the original grid with 0.\n\nBased on the examples, the test input's output should have certain numbers replaced. For instance, the 2s in the top half might be moved to fill a hole in the bottom, and the 7s from the bottom moved to fill a hole in the top.",
