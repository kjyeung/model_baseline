        "cot_1": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the given input grids into the output lists. Let me look at the training examples to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has several numbers like 4, 6, 8, and 3. The output is [4,6,8] repeated five times. Hmm. Let me check where those numbers are in the grid. The 8s are in the first few rows on the right side. The 4s form a vertical line in the middle, and the 6s are in a horizontal line lower down. Maybe the output is collecting certain numbers from the input based on some criteria.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output is [9,4]. The 9s are in the lower left, and the 4s are on the right. In the input grid, these numbers might be part of specific structures. Example 2's output is [2], and the 2s are in a horizontal line. Example 3 outputs [8], which is a vertical line. Example 4's output is [2,3], which are a horizontal and a vertical line. Example 5 outputs [1,4,8], which are all vertical lines. \n\nWait a second. Let me check the shapes. For instance, in Example 0, the 4 is vertical (like a column), 6 is horizontal (a row), and 8 is vertical. The output lists them in some order. But the outputs in each example seem to list numbers that form either horizontal or vertical lines. But how are they ordered?\n\nLooking at the outputs. Example 0's output is [4,6,8]. The 4 is a vertical line (three cells), 6 is a horizontal line (two cells?), and 8 is a vertical line. Maybe the numbers are those that form either horizontal or vertical lines (i.e., contiguous in a row or column). Then, the output lists them in the order of their positions from top to bottom or left to right?\n\nWait, perhaps the output lists all the numbers that form \"blocks\" (contiguous same numbers in a straight line, either horizontal or vertical) in the input grid, ordered based on their positions. Then, the output is a list of these numbers, each line being the same list repeated as many times as the length of the longest block or something. Wait, but the outputs in the examples vary in the number of lines. For example, in Example 0, the output has 5 lines. Looking at the input grid, maybe the output lines correspond to the number of rows that have the maximum count of blocks? Or perhaps the output lines are the number of times the maximum length of the blocks.\n\nWait, let's take Example 0. The output has 5 lines of [4,6,8]. Let's see the blocks. The 4 is a vertical line in column 2, spanning rows 2-5 (4 cells). The 6 is a horizontal line in row 3 and 5, maybe two cells each? Or maybe row 3 has a horizontal 6,6 and row 5 has 6,6 as well. Wait, maybe each block is a contiguous same-number in a straight line. Then, each such block is considered. Then, the output lists the numbers of those blocks, ordered perhaps by their starting position (from top to bottom, left to right), and the number of lines in the output corresponds to the maximum length of the blocks. For example, if the longest block has length 5, then the output has 5 lines, each line being the same list of numbers. \n\nLooking at Example 0's input:\n\nThe 8's are in rows 1, 2, 3. Let's see row 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8]. That's three 8's in a row (horizontal block). The 4's in column 2 (rows 2-5?), but looking at the rows:\n\nRow 2: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8] \u2013 a single 4.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,4,0,0,6,6,0,0,8] \u2013 4 in column 2, then 6,6 in columns 5-6.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,4,4,0,0,6,0,0,8] \u2013 4,4 in columns 2-3, then 6 in column 6.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider contiguous same numbers in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical). For each contiguous block (horizontal or vertical), note the number and the length. Then collect all the numbers, sort them in some order (maybe by the position of their starting cell: topmost then leftmost for horizontal, leftmost then topmost for vertical?), and the number of output lines is the maximum length of any of those blocks. Then each line of the output is the list of the numbers of the blocks, ordered, and repeated for the maximum length lines.\n\nSo, for example, in Example 0, the blocks are:\n\n- The 8's in row 1, columns 7-9 (three 8s, horizontal) \u2192 length 3.\n\n- The 4's in column 2, rows 2-5 (four 4s, vertical) \u2192 length 4.\n\n- The 6's in row 3, columns 5-6 (two 6s, horizontal), and row 4, column 6 (maybe a single 6?), but maybe there's another 6 in row 5, columns 5-6 (two 6s). Wait, maybe each contiguous horizontal or vertical line counts as a block. So in row 3, columns 5-6: two 6s. Then in row 5, columns 5-6: two 6s. Are those separate blocks? Or are they considered as part of the same block if they are adjacent vertically? No, because they're in different rows. So each horizontal block is in the same row, contiguous. Each vertical block is in the same column, contiguous.\n\nSo in Example 0, the blocks would be:\n\n1. Row 1, columns 7-9: 8 (length 3, horizontal)\n\n2. Column 2, rows 2-5: 4 (length 4, vertical)\n\n3. Row 3, columns 5-6: 6 (length 2, horizontal)\n\n4. Row 4, columns 2-3: 4 (length 2, horizontal?) Wait, but column 2, rows 2-5: that's a vertical block of 4. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the input grid for Example 0:\n\nRow 2: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8] \u2192 the 4 is at column 2, row 2.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,4,0,0,6,6,0,0,8] \u2192 column 2 (row 3) has 4. Then, row 3 has 6,6 in columns 5-6.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,4,4,0,0,6,0,0,8] \u2192 columns 2-3 (row 4) have 4,4. Then column 6 has a 6.\n\nRow 5: [0,0,4,0,0,6,6,0,0,0] \u2192 column 2 (row 5) has a 4. Then columns 5-6 (row 5) have 6,6.\n\nSo, for vertical blocks:\n\nThe 4 in column 2, rows 2-5: that's four consecutive 4s (rows 2,3,4,5 in column 2). So vertical block of length 4.\n\nThe 8s in column 8 (rows 1,2,3,4). Let's see:\n\nRow 1: column 8 is 8? The first row's columns are 0-based. Wait, looking at Example 0 input:\n\nRow 1 (second line) is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8]. So columns 7,8,9 (assuming 0-based) are 8s. So that's a horizontal block of 3 in row 1.\n\nThen row 2's column 9 (last element) is 8. Row 3's column 9 is 8. Row 4's column 9 is 8. So that's a vertical block of 4 (rows 1-4, column 9?), but wait row 1's column 9 is 8, but rows 2,3,4's column 9 is 8? Let me check:\n\nRow 1 (second line): [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8] \u2192 columns 7,8,9 are 8. So row 1, columns 7-9: 8,8,8 (horizontal block of 3).\n\nRow 2: [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8] \u2192 column 9 is 8 (row 2).\n\nRow 3: [0,0,4,0,0,6,6,0,0,8] \u2192 column 9 is 8 (row 3).\n\nRow 4: [0,0,4,4,0,0,6,0,0,8] \u2192 column 9 is 8 (row4).\n\nSo from rows 1 to 4, column 9 has 8 in each row. That's a vertical block of 4. So vertical block of 8, length 4.\n\nWait, but row 1's column 9 is 8, row 2's column 9 is 8, etc. So that's column 9, rows 1-4 (assuming rows are 0-based or 1-based? The examples may use 0-based rows. Let's assume the input is given as rows 0-9 (since each is a list of 10 elements). So row 0 is first line.\n\nWait, the first example in Example 0 is:\n\nINPUT:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row 0\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8] \u2192 row 1\n\n[0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8] \u2192 row 2\n\n[0,0,4,0,0,6,6,0,0,8] \u2192 row3\n\n[0,0,4,4,0,0,6,0,0,8] \u2192 row4\n\nSo in row1 (second line), columns 7,8,9 are 8. Then, rows 2,3,4 in column9 (which is the 10th column, index 9) are 8. So column9 has 8 in rows1,2,3,4. That's four 8s in a vertical line. So vertical block of 4.\n\nThen the 6s:\n\nIn row3 (third line of input), columns5-6 (indices5 and6) are 6,6 \u2192 horizontal block of 2.\n\nIn row5 (fifth line of input): [0,0,4,0,0,6,6,0,0,0] \u2192 columns5-6 are 6,6 \u2192 horizontal block of 2.\n\nSo in that case, the 6 blocks are two separate horizontal blocks each of length 2.\n\nBut the output for Example 0 is [4,6,8] repeated five times. How does that fit?\n\nIf the output is collecting all the numbers of the blocks, sorted by some order, and the number of lines in the output is the maximum length of any block. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0:\n\nBlocks:\n\n- 4 (vertical, length4)\n\n- 6 (horizontal, row3, length2)\n\n- 6 (horizontal, row5, length2)\n\n- 8 (vertical, column9, length4)\n\nWait, but why are there two 6s but the output lists 6 once? Because the output lists the numbers of each unique block? Or maybe it's grouping same numbers. No, in example0's output, [4,6,8], each number appears once. So perhaps the numbers are collected from each distinct block, regardless of how many times they appear, but ordered in a certain way. Or perhaps if there are multiple blocks with the same number, they are merged.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the numbers that form the longest blocks. But in Example0, the longest blocks are 4 (length4), 8 (length4), and 6 (length2 each). But the output includes 6. So that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output lists all the numbers present in the blocks, sorted in ascending order. But example0's output is [4,6,8], which is in order. Example1's output is [9,4], which is 4 comes after 9, which is not ascending. So that can't be.\n\nAnother approach: the order in the output list is determined by the position of the block's starting cell. For horizontal blocks, the starting cell is the leftmost, then topmost. For vertical blocks, the starting cell is the topmost, then leftmost. Then, the blocks are ordered first by their starting row, then by starting column. Then, their numbers are listed in that order.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nThe vertical 4 in column2 starts at row2 (assuming 0-based rows). The horizontal 8 in row1 starts at column7. The vertical 8 in column9 starts at row1. The horizontal 6 in row3 starts at column5, and the horizontal 6 in row5 starts at column5.\n\nWait, maybe all the blocks are considered, and their numbers are listed in the order of their starting positions. But the output lists [4,6,8]. Let's see:\n\nVertical 4 (column2) starts at row2, column2. So first occurrence is row2.\n\nHorizontal 8 in row1 starts at column7.\n\nVertical 8 in column9 starts at row1.\n\nHorizontal 6 in row3 starts at column5.\n\nHorizontal 6 in row5 starts at column5.\n\nSo the earliest starting row would be row1 for the horizontal 8 (columns7-9) and the vertical 8 (column9, rows1-4). Then the vertical4 starts at row2. Then the 6s start at row3 and row5.\n\nSo ordering by starting row:\n\n- row1: horizontal 8 (columns7-9) and vertical8 (column9, rows1-4). Which comes first? The horizontal block starts at row1, column7. The vertical block starts at row1, column9. So horizontal comes before vertical in the same row, as columns are left to right.\n\nThen, the vertical4 starts at row2, column2.\n\nThen horizontal6 at row3, column5.\n\nThen another horizontal6 at row5, column5.\n\nSo the numbers in order would be 8 (from horizontal), 8 (vertical), 4,6,6. But the output lists [4,6,8], so that approach may not be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical blocks are considered before horizontal blocks when in the same row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output lists the numbers of all blocks, sorted by the maximum length of their blocks, and then by their starting positions. But example0 has 4 and 8 with length4, which are the longest. 6 has length2. So why are they included?\n\nWait, the output in example0 is [4,6,8], which has three elements. The input has:\n\n- vertical4 (length4)\n\n- vertical8 (length4)\n\n- two horizontal6s (each length2)\n\nSo perhaps the numbers are collected from all blocks, and duplicates are removed, then ordered by some criteria. But why are 4,6,8 in that order?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output lists the numbers of each block, sorted by the length of the block in descending order, and then by their starting positions. So the longest blocks come first. For example, 4 (length4) and 8 (length4) are first. Then 6 (length2). But the output lists 4,6,8. So maybe within same length, they are ordered by starting position. The vertical4 starts at row2, column2. The vertical8 starts at row1, column9. So the vertical4 starts earlier in rows, so comes before. Then the 6s are next. But why is 6 listed once? Because all the 6 blocks are considered as separate but same number? Or perhaps the number is listed once per unique number, but ordered by their first occurrence. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is listing all the numbers present in any block, sorted by their numeric value. But example0's output is 4,6,8 which is ascending. Example1's output is [9,4], which is descending. So that's conflicting. Example5's output is [1,4,8], which is ascending. Example4's output is [2,3], ascending. Example3's output is [8]. Example2's output is [2]. So the order is not numeric. Hmm.\n\nSo perhaps the order is based on the position of the blocks. Let's take example5's output [1,4,8]. The blocks in example5:\n\nLooking at the input:\n\nRow2: 1 in column1.\n\nRow3: 1 in column1.\n\nRow4: 1 in column1. So that's a vertical block of 3 (rows2,3,4 in column1). Number 1.\n\nThen, row5 and 6 have 4s in column3. So row5: [0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns3-4 (0-based) have 4,4. That's a horizontal block of 2 (row5, columns3-4). Number4.\n\nRow3: columns7-9 have 8,8,8 (horizontal block in row3, columns7-9). Number8.\n\nSo the blocks are:\n\n1. Vertical 1 (column1, rows2-4) \u2192 length3.\n\n2. Horizontal 4 (row5, columns3-4) \u2192 length2.\n\n3. Horizontal 8 (row3, columns7-9) \u2192 length3.\n\nSo the output is [1,4,8]. The order could be based on the starting positions. The 1's vertical block starts at row2, column1. The 4's horizontal block starts at row5, column3. The 8's horizontal block starts at row3, column7. So ordering by the starting row first. 1 starts at row2 (earliest), then 8 at row3, then 4 at row5. So the order would be [1,8,4], but the output is [1,4,8]. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, ordering by the starting column. 1 starts at column1 (earliest), then 4 at column3, then8 at column7. So the order would be [1,4,8], which matches the output. So the blocks are ordered by their starting column (leftmost first), and within the same column, by the starting row (topmost first). For horizontal blocks, the starting column is the leftmost of the block. For vertical blocks, the starting column is the column. So in example5, the vertical 1 is in column1, so comes first. Then the horizontal4 starts at column3. Then the horizontal8 starts at column7. So the order is 1,4,8. That fits the output.\n\nIn example0, the blocks are:\n\n- vertical4 (column2, starts row2), \n\n- horizontal8 (row1, column7), \n\n- vertical8 (column9, starts row1), \n\n- horizontal6 (row3, column5), \n\n- horizontal6 (row5, column5).\n\nSo the blocks' starting columns are 2,7,9,5,5. So sorted by starting column:\n\n2 (vertical4), 5 (horizontal6 row3), 5 (horizontal6 row5), 7 (horizontal8),9 (vertical8).\n\nBut the output is [4,6,8]. So perhaps the vertical4 (column2) comes first, then the horizontal6 (column5), then horizontal8 (column7), then vertical8 (column9). But how are the two 6 blocks handled? They are both starting at column5, but different rows. So first the one in row3 (earlier row) comes before row5. So the order would be vertical4 (column2), horizontal6 (row3, column5), horizontal6 (row5, column5), horizontal8 (row1, column7), vertical8 (column9). But the output lists 6 once. So maybe if there are multiple blocks with the same number, they are merged, but how? Or maybe the output lists all the numbers, even if they are repeated. But in example0's output, [4,6,8], 6 is present once. But there are two 6 blocks. So perhaps if there are multiple blocks with the same number, they are grouped and listed once, but ordered based on the first occurrence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is listing all distinct numbers present in any block, ordered by the first occurrence of their block's starting column and row. So in example0, the first block is vertical4 (column2), then the next is horizontal6 (row3, column5), then horizontal8 (row1, column7). The vertical8 (column9) starts later. But the output has [4,6,8]. So perhaps the vertical8 (column9) is considered after the horizontal8 (column7). Wait, but the horizontal8 is in row1, column7. The vertical8 starts in row1, column9. So the horizontal8's starting column is 7, which comes before column9, so it's first. Then the vertical8 would be next. But the output only lists 8 once. So maybe the numbers are unique, and ordered by the first occurrence of their number in any block.\n\nIn example0, the first occurrence is 4 (vertical4), then 6 (horizontal6 in row3), then 8 (horizontal8 in row1). So the order is [4,6,8], which matches the output. The vertical8 in column9 is the same number 8, but it's the first occurrence of 8 in the horizontal block. So even if there are multiple blocks with the same number, they are merged into one entry, ordered by the earliest occurrence of that number.\n\nSo the steps seem to be:\n\n1. Identify all contiguous horizontal or vertical blocks (same number, contiguous in row or column).\n\n2. For each block, note its number and starting position (column, row).\n\n3. Collect all unique numbers from these blocks.\n\n4. Order these unique numbers based on the earliest occurrence of their block's starting position (leftmost column first, then topmost row in case of same column).\n\n5. The output is a list of these numbers in that order, repeated as many times as the maximum length of any block. Each line is the same list.\n\nFor example, in example0:\n\nThe blocks are:\n\n- vertical4 (column2, starts at row2) \u2192 number4, starts column2, row2.\n\n- horizontal8 (row1, columns7-9) \u2192 number8, starts column7, row1.\n\n- vertical8 (column9, starts row1) \u2192 number8, starts column9, row1.\n\n- horizontal6 (row3, columns5-6) \u2192 number6, starts column5, row3.\n\n- horizontal6 (row5, columns5-6) \u2192 number6, starts column5, row5.\n\nSo the unique numbers are 4,6,8.\n\nFor ordering:\n\nThe earliest occurrence is:\n\n4 starts at column2 (earliest column), so first.\n\nNext is 6: first occurrence is column5, row3.\n\nThen 8: first occurrence is column7, row1 (from the horizontal8 block).\n\nSo the order is [4,6,8].\n\nThe maximum block length is 4 (vertical4 and vertical8). So the output has 4 lines? Wait, example0's output has 5 lines. Wait, example0's output is 5 lines of [4,6,8]. Hmm. That contradicts. Because the vertical4 and vertical8 are length4. Why 5 lines?\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the block lengths. Let's recheck:\n\nvertical4 in column2 starts at row2 (input row index2) and spans rows2,3,4,5. Because in row2 (index2), column2 is 4. Then row3, column2 is 4. Row4, column2 is 4. Row5, column2 is 4. So four rows. So length4.\n\nThe vertical8 in column9 starts at row1 (input row1) and spans rows1,2,3,4. Four rows. So length4.\n\nhorizontal8 in row1 (columns7-9) is three cells. Length3.\n\nhorizontal6 in row3 (columns5-6) \u2192 length2.\n\nhorizontal6 in row5 (columns5-6) \u2192 length2.\n\nSo the maximum block length is4. But example0's output has 5 lines. That's conflicting.\n\nHmm. So that approach may not work. So maybe the maximum block length is not the determining factor for the number of lines.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nExample0's output has 5 lines. Let's check the maximum block length in example0: 4. So why 5 lines? Wait, maybe the number of lines is the maximum number of blocks any single row or column has? Or perhaps the sum of the lengths of the blocks. Or maybe it's the maximum between the maximum vertical length and maximum horizontal length. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of lines is determined by the maximum row or column index of the blocks. But example0's output has 5 lines. Not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the number of lines in each output and compare with the input.\n\nExample0: output has5 lines. Looking at the input, the vertical8 in column9 runs from row1 to row4 (4 cells). The vertical4 in column2 runs from row2 to row5 (4 cells). The horizontal8 in row1 is 3 cells. The 6s are two cells each.\n\nBut why 5 lines? Not sure. Maybe the number of lines is the maximum of all the block lengths. But 4 is the maximum here. So example0's output has5 lines. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of output lines is the maximum between the vertical and horizontal block lengths. For example, in example0, the vertical blocks have length4, the horizontal blocks have length3. But output lines are5. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of lines is the maximum number of blocks in any row or column. Or perhaps it's the maximum number of blocks for a particular number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of lines is the sum of the lengths of all blocks. But that would be 4 (vertical4) +3 (horizontal8) +4 (vertical8) +2+2=15, but example0's output is5 lines. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of lines corresponds to the number of rows in the input that contain any block. Let's see example0's input rows:\n\nRow1: has horizontal8 (3 cells).\n\nRow2: vertical4.\n\nRow3: vertical4, horizontal6.\n\nRow4: vertical4, vertical8.\n\nRow5: vertical4, horizontal6.\n\nRows6-9: maybe no blocks. So 5 rows (rows1-5) contain blocks. So the output has5 lines. Which matches example0's output of5 lines. That seems plausible.\n\nExample1's output has9 lines. Looking at the input grid for example1:\n\nThe blocks are 9s and4s. Let's check which rows have blocks. For example, the 9s form a vertical block in column1, rows3-8. So rows3-8: that's6 rows. The4s are in rows0-4 (but need to check). Wait, the input for example1 is:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4] \u2192 row0.\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4] \u2192 row1.\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4] \u2192 row2.\n\nRow3: [0,9,0,0,0,6,0,0,4,4] \u2192 9 in column1, and 4s in columns8-9.\n\nRow4: [0,9,9,0,0,6,0,0,0,4] \u2192 9s in columns1-2.\n\nRow5: [9,9,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0] \u2192 9s in columns0-1.\n\nRow6: [0,9,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0] \u21929 in column1.\n\nRow7: [0,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u21929s in columns1-2.\n\nRow8: [0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u21929 in column1.\n\nRow9: all zeros.\n\nThe blocks for 9 are:\n\n- vertical blocks? Let's see:\n\nLooking at column1:\n\nRow3:9.\n\nRow4:9.\n\nRow5:9 (column1 in row5 is part of a horizontal block in columns0-1).\n\nRow6:9.\n\nRow7:9.\n\nRow8:9.\n\nBut maybe they form a vertical block in column1, rows3-8 (6 rows). So vertical block of9, length6.\n\nThe 4s:\n\nIn row0, columns7-9:4,4,4 \u2192 horizontal block of3.\n\nRow1, columns7 and9:4 and4 (separated by 0), so not contiguous. So two single 4s.\n\nRow2, column9:4.\n\nRow3, columns8-9:4,4 \u2192 horizontal block of2.\n\nRow4, column9:4.\n\nSo the 4 blocks are:\n\n- row0, columns7-9: length3.\n\n- row3, columns8-9: length2.\n\n- others are single.\n\nSo the rows that contain any block are:\n\nrow0 (4s), row1 (4s?), row2 (4 in column9?), row3 (9 and4), row4 (9 and4), row5 (9 and6s), row6 (9), row7 (9), row8 (9), row9: no.\n\nWait, row1 has a 4 in column7 and9, but not contiguous. So those are single 4s, not blocks. So they are not considered as blocks. So the rows with blocks are:\n\nrow0 (4 block), row3,4,5,6,7,8 (9 blocks), row5 also has 6s. So rows0,3,4,5,6,7,8: total 7 rows. But example1's output has9 lines. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: the number of lines in the output is equal to the maximum number of blocks present in any single row or column. For example, in example0, which row has the most blocks? Let's see:\n\nRow3 in example0: has vertical4, horizontal6. So two blocks. Other rows have 1 or 0. So maximum is2. But the output has5 lines. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the number of lines is the sum of the lengths of all blocks. But in example0, sum is4+3+4+2+2=15. But output is5 lines. Not matching.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the number of lines in the output is the maximum value among the numbers in the output list. For example, example0's output is [4,6,8], maximum is8. Output has5 lines. But 8\u22605. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of lines is determined by the number of blocks. In example0, there are5 blocks (vertical4, horizontal8, vertical8, two horizontal6). Output has5 lines. That matches. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1's output has9 lines. How many blocks are there in example1's input?\n\nBlocks for 9:\n\n- vertical block in column1, rows3-8 (6 cells \u2192 length6).\n\n- horizontal blocks in row4 (columns1-2: 9,9 \u2192 length2).\n\n- row5 (columns0-1:9,9 \u2192 length2).\n\n- row7 (columns1-2:9,9 \u2192 length2).\n\nSo total blocks for 9: 1 vertical (length6) and 3 horizontal (each length2).\n\nBlocks for4:\n\n- row0 (columns7-9:4,4,4 \u2192 length3).\n\n- row3 (columns8-9:4,4 \u2192 length2).\n\n- row4 (column9:4 \u2192 single, not a block).\n\nSo blocks for4: 2 (length3 and length2).\n\nOther blocks:6 in row3 (column5:6?), but row3 has a 6 in column5 and 6 in column6? Let's see example1's input row3: [0,9,0,0,0,6,0,0,4,4]. So columns5 is6, column6 is0. So no. Row4 has6 in column5. Row5 has6 in columns4-6:6,6,6 (columns4,5,6). So horizontal block of3 in row5. So block for6: length3.\n\nSo total blocks:\n\nFor9: 4 blocks (1 vertical, 3 horizontal).\n\nFor4: 2 blocks.\n\nFor6: 1 block.\n\nTotal blocks:4+2+1=7. But example1's output has9 lines. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the number of lines is the sum of all block lengths. For example0's sum is4+3+4+2+2=15, but output lines are5. So no.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the outputs and see if the number of lines corresponds to the maximum vertical or horizontal block's length.\n\nExample0: output lines5. The vertical8 is length4, vertical4 is4, horizontal8 is3. Max is4. So not.\n\nExample1's output has9 lines. The vertical9 block is6, so max is6. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample2's output has5 lines. The block for2 is horizontal in row1 (columns5-6?), length2. So output lines5. Not matching.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck on the number of lines. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the output for each example is a list of lists. The number of lines in the output seems to correspond to the maximum number of contiguous same digits in any row or column. But example0's output has5 lines. Let's check the input's maximum contiguous digits:\n\nIn example0:\n\n- vertical4 has4.\n\n- vertical8 has4.\n\n- horizontal8 has3.\n\nSo maximum is4. Output has5 lines. So that's not it.\n\nExample1's output has9 lines. The vertical9 block is6. So again, 6 vs9 lines.\n\nExample2's output has5 lines. The 2's block is length2. So 2 vs5 lines.\n\nNo. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: the number of lines in the output is the number of rows in the input that have at least one block. For example0:\n\nRows with blocks:\n\nRow1 (8s), row2 (4), row3 (4 and6), row4 (4 and6), row5 (4 and6), row7 (3s), row8 (3s). Wait, example0's input has rows0-9. Let's recheck:\n\nRow0: all zeros.\n\nRow1: 8s.\n\nRow2:4.\n\nRow3:4 and6.\n\nRow4:4 and6.\n\nRow5:4 and6.\n\nRow6: zeros.\n\nRow7:3s.\n\nRow8:3s.\n\nRow9: zeros.\n\nSo rows with blocks are1,2,3,4,5,7,8. Total7 rows. But example0's output has5 lines. So no.\n\nAlternative approach: maybe the number of output lines is determined by the maximum number of blocks in any single row or column. For example0, row3 has two blocks (4 and6). Other rows have one or zero. So maximum is2. Output lines5. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of output lines is the maximum number of digits in the output list. For example0, output list has3 elements. But output has5 lines. No.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's take another approach. Let's focus on the Test Input and see what the answer would be, based on the patterns.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0] \u2192 row0.\n\n[0,0,5,0,0,0,0,1,1,1] \u2192 row1.\n\n[0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row2.\n\n[0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row3.\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row4.\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0] \u2192 row5.\n\n[8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row6.\n\n[8,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row7.\n\n[8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row8.\n\n[0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 row9.\n\nLooking for blocks:\n\nVertical and horizontal contiguous same numbers.\n\nRow0: 1 in column8 \u2192 single, not a block.\n\nRow1: 5 in column2, and 1s in columns7-9 (three 1s \u2192 horizontal block of3).\n\nRow2:5,5 in columns1-2 \u2192 horizontal block of2.\n\nRow3:5 in column2 \u2192 single.\n\nRow5:9,9 in columns5-6 \u2192 horizontal block of2.\n\nRow6:8 in column0 \u2192 single.\n\nRow7:8 in column0 (but row7:8,0,0,2,2...). Wait, rows6,7,8: column0. Row6 has8, row7 has8, row8 has8. So vertical block of3 in column0, rows6-8.\n\nRow7:2,2 in columns3-4 \u2192 horizontal block of2.\n\nRow8:2 in column3 \u2192 single.\n\nRow9:2 in column3 \u2192 single.\n\nSo the blocks are:\n\n- Horizontal1 in row1, columns7-9 (length3).\n\n- Horizontal5 in row2, columns1-2 (length2).\n\n- Vertical5: row1,2,3 in column2. Row1 has5 in column2 (row1, column2). Row2 has5 in columns1-2. Wait, row2 is [0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So columns1 and2 are 5,5. So row2's 5s are horizontal. So vertical blocks for5: column2, row1 (single), row2 (5 in column2 is part of a horizontal block, so not part of a vertical block. Because in row1, column2 is5. Row2, column2 is5 (part of a horizontal block). So vertical block for5 would be row1,2,3: column2. Let's check row3's column2:5. So row1, column2:5; row2, column2:5 (part of horizontal block); row3, column2:5. So contiguous vertically? Yes. So vertical block of3 (rows1-3, column2).\n\n- Horizontal9 in row5, columns5-6 (length2).\n\n- Vertical8 in column0, rows6-8 (length3).\n\n- Horizontal2 in row7, columns3-4 (length2).\n\n- Vertical2: row7,8,9 in column3. Row7 has2 in columns3-4 (horizontal block), row8 has2 in column3 (row8's column3 is2), row9 has2 in column3. So vertical block of3 (rows7-9, column3).\n\nSo blocks are:\n\n1. Horizontal1 in row1 (columns7-9) \u2192 length3.\n\n2. Horizontal5 in row2 (columns1-2) \u2192 length2.\n\n3. Vertical5 in column2 (rows1-3) \u2192 length3.\n\n4. Horizontal9 in row5 (columns5-6) \u2192 length2.\n\n5. Vertical8 in column0 (rows6-8) \u2192 length3.\n\n6. Horizontal2 in row7 (columns3-4) \u2192 length2.\n\n7. Vertical2 in column3 (rows7-9) \u2192 length3.\n\nSo the unique numbers are 1,5,9,8,2.\n\nNow, order these based on their starting positions. The starting column for each block:\n\n1. Horizontal1: row1, column7.\n\n2. Horizontal5: row2, column1.\n\n3. Vertical5: column2, row1.\n\n4. Horizontal9: row5, column5.\n\n5. Vertical8: column0, row6.\n\n6. Horizontal2: row7, column3.\n\n7. Vertical2: column3, row7.\n\nThe starting positions sorted by column (leftmost first):\n\nVertical8 in column0 (starts row6).\n\nHorizontal5 in row2, column1 (column1).\n\nVertical5 in column2 (column2).\n\nHorizontal1 in column7 (column7).\n\nHorizontal9 in column5 (column5).\n\nHorizontal2 in column3 (column3).\n\nVertical2 in column3 (column3).\n\nWait, the order of columns is 0 <1 <2 <3 <5 <7.\n\nSo the blocks ordered by column:\n\nVertical8 (col0) \u2192 number8.\n\nHorizontal5 (col1) \u2192 number5.\n\nVertical5 (col2) \u2192 number5.\n\nHorizontal2 (col3) \u2192 number2.\n\nVertical2 (col3) \u2192 number2.\n\nHorizontal9 (col5) \u2192 number9.\n\nHorizontal1 (col7) \u2192 number1.\n\nNow, within the same column, order by row (earlier row first). For example, in column3, the horizontal2 starts in row7, and the vertical2 starts in row7. So which comes first? For horizontal blocks, starting row is row7. For vertical blocks, starting row is row7. So which comes first? The horizontal block starts at row7, column3. The vertical block starts at row7, column3. So perhaps the horizontal block comes first.\n\nBut according to the pattern observed in example5, vertical blocks are considered after horizontal blocks in the same column. Wait, in example5, the horizontal4 and vertical1 and horizontal8. The order was vertical1 (column1) first, then horizontal4 (column3), then horizontal8 (column7). So for vertical blocks, they are ordered by their column. But for blocks with the same column, vertical and horizontal blocks are ordered by their starting row.\n\nAlternatively, for the same column, vertical blocks and horizontal blocks are ordered by their starting row. So in column3, the horizontal2 in row7 comes before the vertical2 in row7 (same row). But how to compare when they start in the same row and column?\n\nAlternatively, the order is: all vertical blocks first in the column, then horizontal blocks. Or vice versa.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to apply the same logic as example5.\n\nIn example5, the order was based on the earliest occurrence (by column) of the block's starting position. For vertical blocks, their starting column is their own column, and starting row is the first row of the vertical block. For horizontal blocks, their starting column is the leftmost column of the block, and starting row is their own row.\n\nIn the test input, the blocks are:\n\nVertical8 (column0, row6-8) \u2192 starts at row6, column0.\n\nHorizontal5 (row2, columns1-2) \u2192 starts at row2, column1.\n\nVertical5 (column2, rows1-3) \u2192 starts at row1, column2.\n\nHorizontal1 (row1, columns7-9) \u2192 starts at row1, column7.\n\nHorizontal9 (row5, columns5-6) \u2192 starts at row5, column5.\n\nHorizontal2 (row7, columns3-4) \u2192 starts at row7, column3.\n\nVertical2 (column3, rows7-9) \u2192 starts at row7, column3.\n\nSo the order of starting positions (column first, then row):\n\nVertical8 (0,6).\n\nHorizontal5 (1,2).\n\nVertical5 (2,1).\n\nHorizontal1 (7,1).\n\nHorizontal9 (5,5).\n\nHorizontal2 (3,7).\n\nVertical2 (3,7).\n\nWait, columns are ordered 0,1,2,3,5,7.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Vertical8 (0,6) \u21928.\n\n2. Horizontal5 (1,2) \u21925.\n\n3. Vertical5 (2,1) \u21925.\n\n4. Horizontal9 (5,5) \u21929.\n\n5. Horizontal1 (7,1) \u21921.\n\n6. Horizontal2 (3,7) \u21922.\n\n7. Vertical2 (3,7) \u21922.\n\nBut this skips column3. Wait, columns are ordered 0,1,2,3,5,7. So after column2 comes column3. So horizontal2 (3,7) and vertical2 (3,7) should come after column2.\n\nSo the correct order would be:\n\nVertical8 (0,6).\n\nHorizontal5 (1,2).\n\nVertical5 (2,1).\n\nHorizontal2 (3,7).\n\nVertical2 (3,7).\n\nHorizontal9 (5,5).\n\nHorizontal1 (7,1).\n\nBut how are blocks in the same column ordered? For example, column3 has horizontal2 and vertical2, both starting at row7.\n\nFor blocks in the same column, vertical and horizontal, we need to order by their starting row. But both start at row7. Then, perhaps the horizontal comes first.\n\nSo the order would be:\n\n1. Vertical8 (column0, row6).\n\n2. Horizontal5 (column1, row2).\n\n3. Vertical5 (column2, row1).\n\n4. Horizontal2 (column3, row7).\n\n5. Vertical2 (column3, row7).\n\n6. Horizontal9 (column5, row5).\n\n7. Horizontal1 (column7, row1).\n\nNow, the unique numbers are 8,5,2,9,1. But wait, the vertical5 and horizontal5 are both 5, so merged. Similarly, horizontal2 and vertical2 are 2, merged. So the unique numbers are 8,5,2,9,1.\n\nOrdered based on the first occurrence of each number:\n\n- 8 (from vertical8).\n\n-5 (first from horizontal5 or vertical5? The first occurrence of5 is horizontal5 (column1, row2) or vertical5 (column2, row1).\n\nVertical5 starts at column2, row1 (earlier row than horizontal5's row2). So the first occurrence of5 is vertical5 (column2, row1). So the order of numbers would be:\n\n8 (first),5 (vertical5 comes before horizontal5?), then2,9,1.\n\nWait, but the first occurrence of5 is in horizontal5 (row2, column1) which is in column1, which comes before column2 of vertical5. So the first occurrence of5 is the horizontal5 in column1. So the order would be:\n\n8 (column0), horizontal5 (column1), vertical5 (column2), horizontal2 (column3), vertical2 (column3), horizontal9 (column5), horizontal1 (column7). So the numbers are:\n\n8 (from vertical8).\n\n5 (from horizontal5).\n\n5 (from vertical5).\n\n2 (from horizontal2).\n\n2 (from vertical2).\n\n9 (from horizontal9).\n\n1 (from horizontal1).\n\nBut the output lists unique numbers. So the unique numbers are 8,5,2,9,1. Ordered based on their first occurrence:\n\nFirst is8 (vertical8, column0).\n\nNext is5: first occurrence is horizontal5 (column1, row2).\n\nThen vertical5 is also5, but since it's the same number, it's merged.\n\nThen2: first occurrence is horizontal2 (column3, row7).\n\nThen9: first occurrence is horizontal9 (column5, row5).\n\nThen1: first occurrence is horizontal1 (column7, row1).\n\nSo the ordered list is [8,5,2,9,1].\n\nBut wait, let's check example5's output. In example5, the numbers were [1,4,8], ordered based on their starting columns. 1 (column1),4 (column3),8 (column7). So the order is by the first occurrence's column.\n\nSo in the test case, the numbers are:\n\n8 (column0),5 (column1),2 (column3),9 (column5),1 (column7).\n\nSo ordered by their first occurrence's columns: 0,1,3,5,7. So the numbers would be [8,5,2,9,1].\n\nBut the output lines need to be repeated as many times as the maximum block length. Let's see the blocks' lengths:\n\nVertical8:3.\n\nHorizontal5:2.\n\nVertical5:3.\n\nHorizontal9:2.\n\nHorizontal1:3.\n\nHorizontal2:2.\n\nVertical2:3.\n\nSo the maximum length is3 (several blocks have length3).\n\nSo the output would have3 lines. Each line is [8,5,2,9,1], repeated3 times.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, for example0, the maximum block length was4 (vertical4 and vertical8), and the output has5 lines. So this approach is inconsistent.\n\nWait, example0's output has5 lines. What's the maximum block length there?\n\nvertical4:4, vertical8:4. So max4. But output has5 lines. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the number of lines is not directly related to the block lengths. \n\nAlternative idea: the number of lines in the output is the number of rows in the input that contain at least one block. For the test input:\n\nBlocks are present in rows1,2,5,6,7,8,9. But let's see:\n\nVertical8 is in rows6,7,8.\n\nHorizontal1 in row1.\n\nHorizontal5 in row2.\n\nVertical5 in rows1,2,3.\n\nHorizontal9 in row5.\n\nHorizontal2 in row7.\n\nVertical2 in rows7,8,9.\n\nSo rows containing blocks are1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9. That's8 rows. But the output would have lines equal to this number. But the training examples don't support this either. For example, example0's output has5 lines, but the rows with blocks are1,2,3,4,5,7,8:7 rows. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe the number of lines is the maximum number of overlapping blocks in any single row or column.\n\nAlternatively, the number of lines is the number of rows in the input. But example0's input has10 rows, output5 lines. Not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: the number of output lines is the number of unique numbers in the output list. For example0, 3 unique numbers \u21923 lines. But example0's output has5 lines, so no.\n\nAlternatively, the number of lines is the sum of the digits in the output list. But example0's sum is4+6+8=18. Output lines5. No.\n\nAt this point, perhaps I should focus on the order of the numbers in the output and the number of lines as per the test input. Let's proceed.\n\nIn the test input, the unique numbers are8,5,2,9,1. Ordered by their first occurrence's column:\n\n8 (column0),5 (column1),2 (column3),9 (column5),1 (column7). So the list is [8,5,2,9,1].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, sometimes the order is not strictly by columns. For example, example5's output is [1,4,8]. 1 is in column1,4 in column3,8 in column7. So ordered by columns. So that fits.\n\nExample4's output is [2,3]. 2's first occurrence is in column1, row4 (vertical?), and3 in column5, row2. So2 comes before3, which fits columns1 <5.\n\nExample1's output is [9,4]. 9 is in column1, row3.4's first occurrence is column7, row0. So9's first occurrence is column1,4's is column7. So ordered by columns, 9 (1) comes before4 (7), which matches the output [9,4].\n\nSo the order is based on the first occurrence's column of the block. If multiple blocks have the same number, the earliest occurrence (by column) is considered.\n\nSo in the test input, the numbers are ordered as:\n\n8 (column0),5 (column1),2 (column3),9 (column5),1 (column7).\n\nSo the output list is [8,5,2,9,1].\n\nNow, the number of lines. The training examples' output lines vary. Let's see:\n\nIn example0, the output lines are5. The maximum block length is4.\n\nIn example1, output lines9. The maximum block length is6 (vertical9).\n\nIn example2, output lines5. The block length is2.\n\nIn example3, output lines3. The block length is3 (vertical8).\n\nIn example4, output lines3. The maximum block length is2 (both2 and3).\n\nExample5's output has3 lines. The maximum block lengths are3 (1 and8), and2 (4).\n\nThis suggests that the number of lines in the output corresponds to the maximum block length in the input. Let's check:\n\nExample0: max block length4 \u2192 output5 lines. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of lines is the maximum block length among the blocks whose numbers are in the output list. For example0:\n\nThe output numbers are4,6,8. Their blocks:\n\n4's block length4.\n\n6's block lengths2.\n\n8's block lengths3 and4.\n\nThe maximum among these is4. So output lines4. But example0's output has5 lines. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the number of lines is the sum of the lengths of the blocks for each number in the output list. For example0:\n\n4: length4.\n\n6: 2+2=4.\n\n8:3+4=7.\n\nSum:4+4+7=15. But output lines5. No.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the order of the numbers based on the columns and assume the number of lines is the maximum block length among the output numbers.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nThe blocks in the output list are8,5,2,9,1.\n\nTheir lengths:\n\n8:3.\n\n5:3 (vertical5).\n\n2:3 (vertical2).\n\n9:2.\n\n1:3.\n\nMaximum length is3. So output lines3.\n\nBut looking at example0, the max length is4 but output lines5. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of lines is the number of rows in the input that contain the first occurrence of each number in the output list. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of lines is the number of rows in the input that have any block. For example0's input, rows1,2,3,4,5,7,8. So7 rows, but output lines5. Doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the number of lines is the maximum length of any block in the input, regardless of whether it's included in the output. For example0, the vertical8 (column9) is length4. So output lines4. But example0's output has5 lines. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of lines is the sum of the lengths of the blocks for the numbers in the output list. For example0,4+6+8's blocks:4 (4) +2 (6) +4 (8) =10. Output lines5. No.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the difficulty, I'll proceed with the assumption that the output list is the unique numbers ordered by their first occurrence's column, and the number of lines is the maximum block length among the output numbers.\n\nFor the test input, the output list is [8,5,2,9,1], and the maximum block length is3. So the output would be three lines of this list.\n\nBut looking at the training examples:\n\nExample0's output has5 lines. The maximum block length among4,6,8 is4 (4 and8). So why 5 lines? I'm not sure. Maybe the number of lines is the sum of the lengths of all the blocks for the output numbers. For example0,4 (4) + 6 (2+2) +8 (3+4) =4+4+7=15. But output lines5. No.\n\nAlternative approach: the number of lines in the output is the number of distinct block lengths present in the output numbers. For example0's output numbers have lengths4,2,3,4 \u2192 distinct lengths are2,3,4 \u21923 distinct. Output lines5. No.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to accept that I can't determine the exact pattern for the number of lines, but based on the examples, the test input's output should be the list [5,8,2,9,1] or [8,5,2,9,1], repeated a certain number of times. \n\nLooking at the test input's blocks, the vertical2 has length3, vertical5 has3, vertical8 has3, and horizontal1 has3. So the maximum length is3. So the output would have3 lines.\n\nBut in example5, the maximum block length is3 (1 and8), and the output has3 lines. So that fits.\n\nIn example0, the maximum block length is4, but output has5 lines. This contradicts. Hmm.\n\nWait, example3's output has3 lines, and the maximum block length is3 (vertical8). So this fits.\n\nExample4's output has3 lines. The maximum block length is2 (2 and3). So it doesn't fit.\n\nSo this pattern is not consistent.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the order of the numbers based on their first occurrence's column and the number of lines equal to the maximum block length among the output numbers.\n\nFor the test input, the maximum block length is3 (8,5,2,1).\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[8,5,2,9,1]\n\n[8,5,2,9,1]\n\n[8,5,2,9,1]\n\nBut I need to check the training examples for how they handle duplicate numbers in blocks. For example, example0 has two 6 blocks but lists6 once. So the output lists unique numbers ordered by first occurrence.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output lines are equal to the maximum number of blocks per row. For example, in the test input, row7 has two blocks (horizontal2 and vertical2). So maximum is2. So output lines2. But example0's output has5 lines, which may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of lines is determined by the longest contiguous block's length. For the test input, it's3. So output lines3.\n\nSo the final answer would be three lines of [8,5,2,9,1].\n\nBut looking at the test input's vertical2 block (length3), vertical5 (3), vertical8 (3), horizontal1 (3). So maximum3. So output has3 lines.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n[5, 8, 2, 9, 1]\n\n[5, 8, 2, 9, 1]\n\n[5, 8, 2, 9, 1]\n\nWait, but earlier analysis said the order is [8,5,2,9,1]. Let me double-check.\n\nThe first occurrence columns:\n\n8's vertical block starts at column0.\n\nhorizontal5 starts at column1.\n\nvertical5 starts at column2.\n\nhorizontal2 starts at column3.\n\nvertical2 starts at column3.\n\nhorizontal9 starts at column5.\n\nhorizontal1 starts at column7.\n\nSo ordered by columns:0,1,2,3,5,7.\n\nSo the numbers are8,5,2,9,1. The vertical5 starts at column2, but the horizontal5 is in column1. So 5 comes from the horizontal5 in column1 first. So the order is:\n\n8 (column0),5 (column1),2 (column3),9 (column5),1 (column7).\n\nThus, the list is [8,5,2,9,1].\n\nSo the output would be three lines:\n\n[8,5,2,9,1]\n\n[8,5,2,9,1]\n\n[8,5,2,9,1]\n\nBut let me check example5's test case. Example5's output is [1,4,8], which are ordered by columns1 (vertical1),3 (horizontal4),7 (horizontal8). So the order is correct.\n\nThus, the test input's output should be three lines of [8,5,2,9,1].",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the input grids and their corresponding outputs, then apply that pattern to the test input. \n\nLooking at the training examples, each input is a 10x10 grid of numbers, and the output is a list of numbers repeated in several lines. Let's start by analyzing the examples to see what's common between the input and output.\n\nStarting with Example 0: The output is [4, 6, 8] repeated five times. Looking at the input grid, there are numbers 4, 6, 8, and 3. But why are 4,6,8 chosen? Let's check their positions. The 4s form a vertical line in the middle-left area. The 6s are in the middle-right, and 8 is on the right side. The 3s are at the bottom. Maybe the output numbers are those that are part of certain shapes or connected regions. But why are 4,6,8 selected and 3 excluded? Wait, in the output, it's ordered 4,6,8. Maybe they are ordered from left to right based on their positions in the grid? Let me check another example.\n\nExample 1's output is [9,4]. The input has 9s on the left and 4s on the right. The 6s are present but not in the output. So maybe the numbers in the output are those that are part of the largest connected regions or maybe the ones that are in specific rows or columns. Alternatively, perhaps the output lists numbers in the order of their vertical positions from top to bottom. Wait, in Example 0: 4 is in row 2-5, 6 in row 3-5, 8 in rows 1-3 and 4. Maybe the output lists numbers that are present in the most consecutive rows? Not sure. Let's check another example.\n\nExample 2's output is [2]. The input has 7, 2, 1, 3. The 2s are in rows 1-3. The output is [2]. Maybe the output numbers are those that form horizontal lines? Or maybe they're the rightmost numbers. In example 2, the 1s are all on the right, but the output is 2. Hmm. Or maybe the numbers that are present in the middle columns. Alternatively, perhaps the output lists numbers that are part of the bottommost layer? Not sure.\n\nExample 3's output is [8]. The input has 8,6,4. The 8 is in rows 3-5, 6 in 4-5. The output is [8]. Maybe the highest number? 8 is higher than 6 and 4. But example 0 has 8,6,4 in the output, which are all present, but 3 is lower. So maybe numbers are ordered from highest to lowest. Let's check example 4's output: [2,3]. The numbers are 2 and 3. 3 is higher than 2, but the output is [2,3]. Wait, that contradicts the highest first. So that's not it. So example 4's output has 2 and 3. The input has 3s in row 2-3, and 2s in rows 4-5. So maybe the order is based on which starts higher. 3 starts in row 2, 2 starts in row 4, so 3 would come before 2. But the output is [2,3]. Hmm. That's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are ordered based on their horizontal position. Let's see. In example 0, the 4 is on column 2-3, 6 on column 5-6, 8 on column 7-9. So left to right, 4 comes first, then 6, then 8. Which matches the output order. In example 1, the 9 is on the left (columns 1-3), and 4 on the right (columns 7-9), so output is [9,4]. Example 2's output is [2]. The 2 is in columns 5-7. The 1 is in column 9, but not in the output. So maybe the numbers in the output are those that form vertical or horizontal lines of certain lengths. Wait, in example 0, the 4s form a vertical line, 6s a horizontal line, and 8s a vertical line. But maybe the output is the numbers that are present in the middle rows. Let me check the outputs' lengths. For example 0, the output has 5 lines. The input has the 4,6,8 spanning rows 2-5, which might correspond to the output's 5 lines. Similarly, example 1's output has 9 lines, and the 9s are present in rows 3-8, which is 6 rows, but the output has 9 lines. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, the output lists the numbers in a certain order, and the number of lines in the output corresponds to the maximum number of rows any of the numbers spans. For example 0: 4 spans rows 2-5 (4 rows?), but the output has 5 lines. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the number of lines in the output is the maximum count of how many rows a particular number appears. Let me check example 0: 4 appears in rows 2-5 (4 rows), 6 in rows 3-5 (3 rows), 8 in rows 1-3 (3 rows). The output has 5 lines, which is more than any of these. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output lines correspond to the number of contiguous rows each number spans. For example, in example 0, 4 is in rows 2-5 (4 rows), 6 in 3-5 (3), 8 in 1-3 (3). The output has 5 lines. Not matching. Maybe the output lines are the same as the maximum height of any of the numbers. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at example 3's output: [8] repeated 3 times. The 8 in the input is present in rows 3-5 (3 rows), so the output has 3 lines. That matches. Example 4's output has 3 lines. The input's 2 is in rows 4-5 (2 rows), 3 in rows 2-3 (2 rows). But output lines are 3. Hmm, maybe not. Example 5's output has 3 lines. The numbers 1 is in rows 2-4 (3 rows), 4 in 5-6 (2), 8 in rows 3 (maybe). Wait, example 5's input: 8 is in row 3. So perhaps that's one row. So maybe the output lines are the maximum of the spans. But 1 spans 3 rows, so output lines are 3. That matches. So maybe the output lines are the maximum number of consecutive rows any of the output numbers occupies. So in example 0, the 4 spans 4 rows (2-5?), but the output is 5 lines. Wait, maybe not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output lines are the number of rows that contain any of the output numbers. For example, in example 0: the numbers 4,6,8 are present in rows 1-5 (since 8 is in row 1, 4 in 2-5, 6 in 3-5). So rows 1-5: 5 rows, so output has 5 lines. That matches. Example 1's output has 9 lines. Let's see: 9 is in rows 3-8 (6 rows?), and 4 is in rows 0 (assuming rows are 0-based) like input row 0, 3,4,5. Wait, looking at example 1's input:\n\nRow 0: 4,4,4 in columns 7-9.\n\nRow 3: 4 in column 9.\n\nRow 4: 4 in column 9.\n\nRow 5: 4 in column 9.\n\nSo 4 is in rows 0,3,4,5. 9 is in rows 3-7. So the combined rows where either 9 or 4 is present are rows 0,3,4,5,6,7. That's 6 rows, but the output has 9 lines. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of output lines is the maximum number of rows covered by any of the output numbers. For example, in example 1, 9 is present in rows 3-8 (6 rows?), and 4 in rows 0-5. Wait, example 1's input has 9 in rows 3,4,5,6,7. So 5 rows. 4 is in row 0,3,4,5. So maximum is 5 rows for 9. But the output has 9 lines. Hmm, not matching.\n\nThis approach might not be the right way. Let's try another angle. Looking at the outputs, each line in the output is a list of numbers. The same list repeated multiple times. So for example, in example 0, the output is [4,6,8] five times. So the main thing is to determine which numbers are included and in what order, and how many lines are generated.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the numbers in the output are those that form \"blocks\" that are contiguous and have a certain size. For instance, maybe each number in the output is part of a connected region (adjacent horizontally or vertically) and the size is at least a certain number. But how to determine which numbers are selected.\n\nLooking at example 0: the 4's form a vertical line of four cells. The 6's form a horizontal line of three cells. The 8's are in a vertical line of three cells. The 3's are two cells. So maybe numbers that have regions of size 3 or more. 4: 4 cells, 6: 3, 8:3. 3: 2. So 3 is excluded, others included. Example 1: 9's region is larger (multiple cells), and 4's maybe some as well. Example 2: 2's region is several cells. So output is 2. So perhaps the numbers in the output are those that have connected regions (adjacent cells) of size 3 or more. Let's check example 3: the 8's region is three cells in a vertical line. So output is [8]. 6's region is two cells, 4's is two. So that fits. Example 4: 3's region is three cells (rows 2-3), 2's is three cells. So output is [2,3]. Example 5: 1's region is three cells (rows 2-4, column 1), 4's is three cells (rows 5-6), 8's is three cells (row 3, column 7-9). So output is [1,4,8]. So the pattern seems to be: collect all numbers that have connected regions (adjacent cells, including diagonally?) with at least 3 cells. Then order them from left to right based on their leftmost occurrence. Wait, example 0's 4 starts at column 2, 6 at column 5, 8 at column 7. So ordered left to right. Example 1's 9 is left (columns 1), 4 is right (columns 7-9). Example 4's 2 starts in column 1, 3 in column 5. Wait, in example 4, the 3 is in column 5 and 6 (rows 2-3), and 2 is in column 1 (rows 4-5). So leftmost for 2 is column 1, 3 is column 5. So output order is [2,3], which is left to right. So yes, the order is left to right based on the leftmost column of each connected region.\n\nThen, for each such number, after collecting all numbers with regions of at least 3 cells, order them left to right. Then, the number of lines in the output is equal to the maximum height (number of rows) covered by any of these regions. For example, in example 0: 4 spans 4 rows (rows 2-5), 6 spans 3 rows (3-5), 8 spans 3 rows (1-3). The maximum is 4 rows, but the output has 5 lines. Wait, rows are 0-based. Let's count:\n\nIn example 0, input is 10 rows (0-9). Let's see:\n\n4 is in rows 2,3,4,5 (rows 2-5: 4 rows). 6 in rows 3,4,5. 8 in rows 1,2,3. So maximum is 4 rows (4). But the output has 5 lines. Hmm, this doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the number of lines is the number of rows covered by the union of all the regions. For example, in example 0, the regions are in rows 1-5 (since 8 is in 1-3, 4 in 2-5, 6 in 3-5). So rows 1-5: 5 rows. Hence 5 lines. Example 1's output has 9 lines, which suggests that the union of rows covered by the regions is 9 rows. Let me check example 1's input. The regions are 9 and 4. 9's rows: rows 3-7 (5 rows). 4's rows: rows 0,3,4,5 (4 rows). The union would be rows 0,3-7. That's 0,3,4,5,6,7: 6 rows. But the output has 9 lines. That doesn't match. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the number of lines in the output is the maximum vertical span (number of rows) of any single region. For example, example 0: 4's vertical span is 4 rows (rows 2-5), so 4 rows. But output has 5 lines. Hmm. Not sure. Maybe another approach.\n\nLooking at example 3's output: 3 lines. The 8's region is rows 3-5 (3 rows). So output lines are 3. Example 4's output is 3 lines. The 2's region is rows 4-5 (2 rows), 3's region rows 2-3 (2 rows). Max is 2, but output has 3 lines. Hmm, no. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output lines are determined by the number of regions. But example 0 has three regions but 5 lines. So no. \n\nAnother angle: the output is the list of numbers in the order of their leftmost occurrence, and each line in the output represents a \"layer\" where each number is present. For example, in example 0, the 4,6,8 regions start at different rows and extend. The output lines are the same list repeated for each row where any of the numbers is present. So in example 0, the regions are present from row 1 to row 5 (since 8 starts at row 1, 4 ends at row5, etc.), so 5 lines. Each line lists the numbers in left-to-right order. So the output lines correspond to the number of rows that any of the regions occupy. So the total rows covered by the union of all regions. For example 0: rows 1-5 (5 rows). So output has 5 lines. Example 1's regions 9 and 4. 9 spans rows 3-7 (5 rows), 4 spans rows 0,3-5. The union would be rows 0,3-7. That's 0,3,4,5,6,7: 6 rows. But the output has 9 lines. So this doesn't fit. \n\nWait, maybe the output lines are the number of rows in the input grid. Wait, the input is 10x10, but the output lines vary. For example, example 0's output is 5 lines, example 1's is 9 lines. The test input is 10 rows. So perhaps the output lines are the number of rows in the input that have at least one cell from any of the regions. Let's check example 0. The regions are in rows 1,2,3,4,5 (since 8 is in row1, and 4 and 6 in 2-5). So 5 rows. So output lines are 5. That fits. Example 1: regions 9 and 4. Rows where they appear: 0 (4), 3,4,5,6,7 (9), and 3,4,5 (4). So rows 0,3,4,5,6,7. That's 6 rows. But output has 9 lines. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output lines correspond to the number of rows in the input where any of the numbers in the output list appears. For example, in example 1, 9 appears in rows 3-8 (rows 3,4,5,6,7,8?), but the input has 10 rows. But output has 9 lines. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to approach it step by step. \n\nThe key is that each example's output is a list of numbers ordered in a certain way, and each output line is the same list repeated for a certain number of times. The numbers in the output seem to be those that form contiguous regions (connected cells) of size at least 3. The order is left to right based on the leftmost column of their regions. Then, the number of lines in the output is the maximum vertical span (number of rows) of any of these regions.\n\nWait, let's check example 0: 4's vertical span is 4 rows (2-5), 6's is 3 (3-5), 8's is 3 (1-3). The maximum is 4, so output has 4 lines. But example 0's output is 5 lines. Hmm. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of lines equals the vertical span of the union of all regions. For example, the earliest row a region starts and the latest row a region ends. In example 0, regions start at row1 (8) and end at row5 (4 and 6). So rows 1-5: 5 rows, hence 5 lines. That fits. Example 1's regions: 9 starts at row3 and ends at row7 (assuming rows are 0-based), 4 starts at row0 and ends at row5. So the union spans rows 0-7: 8 rows. But the output has 9 lines. Wait, example 1's output has 9 lines, which would imply that the union spans rows 0-8 (9 rows), but the input for example1's last row (row9) is all zeros. So maybe there's a miscalculation here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of lines is the vertical span of the regions plus one. For example, example0's span is 5 rows (1-5), which would be 5 lines, which matches. Example1's union of rows is 0-7 (8 rows), so 8 lines. But the output has 9 lines. Hmm. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: the number of lines in the output is the maximum between the vertical spans of the regions. For example, in example1, the 9's vertical span is 5 rows (3-7: 5 rows), and 4's is 4 rows (0,3-5: but maybe 0 is one row, then 3-5 is three rows. So total of 4 rows. Max is 5, so output lines would be 5. But example1's output has 9 lines. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's look for another pattern. \n\nIn example3, the output is three lines of [8]. The input's 8 is in rows3-5 (three rows). So number of lines equals the vertical span of the region. That fits. Example4's output is three lines. The 2's region is in rows4-5 (two rows), 3's region is rows2-3 (two rows). The maximum is two, but output has three lines. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number of lines in the output is the number of rows in the input that contain any of the output numbers. For example, in example3: 8 appears in rows3,4,5. So three rows. Output is three lines. Example4's output has three lines. The numbers 2 and3 appear in rows2,3,4,5. So four rows. But output is three lines. Not matching. \n\nAlternatively, the output lines are determined by the maximum vertical length (number of rows) of any individual region. For example, in example0, the 4's region spans four rows (2-5), 6's three, 8's three. So output lines are four, but example0 has five lines. Doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the output lines are determined by the total number of rows in the input. But examples have varying lines.\n\nWait, example5's output has three lines. The input's numbers are 1,4,8. The 1 is in rows2-4 (three rows), 4 in rows5-6 (two), 8 in row3 (one). So the maximum is three rows. Output has three lines. So that fits. So maybe the number of lines is the maximum vertical span (number of rows) of any individual region in the output. Let's check other examples:\n\nExample0: 4's region spans 4 rows (rows2-5). So output should have 4 lines, but the output is 5 lines. Hmm. Not matching. \n\nBut wait, maybe the vertical span is calculated as the number of rows the region covers. For example, in example0, the 4's region is in rows 2,3,4,5: four rows. So the output lines would be four. But the example output has five lines. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical span includes gaps. For example, if a region is in rows 1,3,5, then the vertical span is 5 rows. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical span is the difference between the first and last row a region appears in. For example, in example0, 4's first row is 2 and last is 5. So 5-2 +1 =4 rows. So output lines would be 4, but example0's output is 5. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's maybe focus on which numbers are selected and their order first, then figure out the lines.\n\nNumbers are selected based on their connected regions having at least three cells. Ordered left to right by their leftmost occurrence. Then, the number of lines is the maximum vertical span (last row - first row +1) of any of these regions.\n\nExample0: 4's span is 4 rows (2-5), 6's is 3 (3-5), 8's is 3 (1-3). Max is 4, so output lines 4. But example0's output has 5. So no.\n\nHmm. Maybe the number of lines is the number of rows in the input starting from the first occurrence of any selected number to the last. For example, in example0, the first selected number's first row is 1 (8) and last is 5 (4). So rows 1-5: 5 rows. Hence 5 lines. That fits. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1: Selected numbers are 9 and4. The first occurrence is row0 (4) and last occurrence row7 (9). Rows0-7: 8 rows. But output is 9 lines. So that would be 8 rows (0-7) but 9 lines. So not matching. Unless the rows are 1-based. Let's try that.\n\nIf the rows are 1-based (i.e., first row is 1), then in example0, the first occurrence is row1 (8) and last is row5 (4). 5 rows, so 5 lines. Fits. In example1, first occurrence row1 (4), last row8 (9). 8-1 +1 = 8 rows. But output is 9 lines. Hmm. So if rows are 0-based, but the count is from first to last inclusive. For example, in example1: first row 0 (4), last row7 (9). 7-0 +1 =8 rows. Output has 9 lines. So doesn't fit. But example1's output has 9 lines. How?\n\nMaybe the number of lines is the maximum number of rows any of the selected numbers occupies. For example, example1's 9 is in rows3-7 (5 rows), 4 in rows0,3-5 (4 rows). Max is 5. But output has 9 lines. Not matching.\n\nI think I'm stuck on the number of lines. Let's put that aside and focus on the numbers and their order. For the test input, the numbers that form regions of at least three cells:\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0] \u2192 1 in column8. But alone.\n\nRow1: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,1,1,1] \u2192 5 in column2. 1s in columns7-9.\n\nRow2: [0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 5s in columns1-2.\n\nRow3: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u21925 in column2.\n\nRow4: all zeros.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0] \u21929s in columns5-6.\n\nRow6: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u21928 in column0.\n\nRow7: [8,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0] \u21928 in column0. 2s in columns3-4.\n\nRow8: [8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u21928 in column0. 2 in column3.\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u21922 in column3.\n\nNow, let's look for connected regions of size >=3.\n\nFirst, the 5s: in row1, column2. Then row2, columns1-2 (two cells). Row3, column2. So connected regions: row1-3. So 3 cells (row1: one, row2: two, row3: one). Total of four cells. So yes, 5's region has size 4. So 5 is included.\n\nNext, the 1s: row1, columns7-9 (three cells), row0, column8. Are they connected? In row0, column8 is a single 1. In row1, columns7-9 are 1s. These are adjacent vertically (row0 to row1, column8). So the 1 in row0 is adjacent to the 1 in row1, column8. So the entire region for 1 is four cells. So size 4. So 1 is included.\n\nThe 9s: row5, columns5-6 (two cells). Size 2. So no.\n\n8s: row6, column0; row7, column0; row8, column0. Three cells vertically connected. Size 3. So included.\n\n2s: row7, columns3-4 (two cells); row8, column3; row9, column3. So row7: two cells, row8: one, row9: one. Connected vertically. Total of four cells. So yes, 2's region has size >=3.\n\nSo the numbers to include are 5,1,8,2. Wait, but wait: 5's region is size 4, 1's size 4, 8's size 3, 2's size 4. So all four numbers. But let's check the order based on leftmost occurrence.\n\nLeftmost for each:\n\n5's leftmost is column1 (row2, column1).\n\n1's leftmost is column7 (row1, column7).\n\n8's leftmost is column0 (row6).\n\n2's leftmost is column3 (row7).\n\nSo order from left to right: 8 (column0),5 (column1), 2 (column3), 1 (column7). So the output list should be [8,5,2,1]. But let's check the training examples for order.\n\nExample5's output is [1,4,8]. Let's see their leftmost columns. 1 is in column1, 4 in column3, 8 in column7. So ordered left to right. So yes. So the order is leftmost column of the region.\n\nThus, in the test case:\n\n8's region leftmost is column0.\n\n5's region leftmost is column1.\n\n2's region leftmost is column3.\n\n1's region leftmost is column7.\n\nSo the order should be [8,5,2,1].\n\nNow, how many lines in the output? The vertical span of each region:\n\n8: rows6-8 (3 rows).\n\n5: rows1-3 (3 rows).\n\n2: rows7-9 (3 rows).\n\n1: rows0-1 (2 rows).\n\nThe vertical spans are 3,3,3,2. So the maximum is 3. But according to some training examples, the output lines are determined by the maximum vertical span. Example3's output has 3 lines for a 3-row region. So in this case, the output would have 3 lines. But in example0, the maximum vertical span was 4 rows, and the output had 5 lines. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, example0's regions were:\n\n8: rows1-3 (3 rows).\n\n4: rows2-5 (4 rows).\n\n6: rows3-5 (3 rows).\n\nSo the vertical span of the regions is 4 rows (for4). But the output has 5 lines. So how does that fit?\n\nWait, perhaps the vertical span is calculated as the number of rows covered by each region, and the total output lines are the maximum of these spans. For example0, the 4's span is 4 rows (rows2-5), so output lines are 4. But example0's output is 5 lines. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output lines are the number of rows from the earliest start row to the latest end row of any region. For example, in example0: earliest start row is 1 (8), latest end row is5 (4). So 5 rows. Hence 5 lines. For the test case, earliest start is row0 (1), and latest end is row9 (2). So rows0-9: 10 rows. But that's unlikely. Let's see:\n\nIn the test case, the regions are:\n\n8: rows6-8 (3 rows).\n\n5: rows1-3 (3 rows).\n\n2: rows7-9 (3 rows).\n\n1: rows0-1 (2 rows).\n\nEarliest start row is 0 (1's region), latest end row is9 (2's region). So rows0-9: 10 rows. So output would have 10 lines. But the training examples don't have that. For example, example0's earliest start is row1 and end row5: 5 rows, output 5 lines. Example1's earliest start is row0, end row7: 8 rows. Output lines are9. Hmm, doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output lines are the number of rows in the input where any of the regions is present. So in the test case, the regions are present in rows0,1,2,3,6,7,8,9. That's 8 rows. So output would have 8 lines. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering the test case, the vertical spans of the regions are:\n\n8: 3 rows (6-8)\n\n5:3 rows (1-3)\n\n2:3 rows (7-9)\n\n1:2 rows (0-1)\n\nThe maximum is3. So the output lines would be3. So each line would be [8,5,2,1], repeated three times. But let's check the training examples.\n\nExample3's output is three lines. The region's vertical span is3 rows. So yes. Example5's output is three lines, which matches the maximum vertical span of 3 (1's region). So this seems plausible.\n\nBut in example0, the maximum vertical span is4 (4's region), output has5 lines. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, example0's output has5 lines, which matches the number of rows from the earliest start (row1) to latest end (row5): rows1-5 inclusive is5 rows. So for test case, earliest start is row0 (1's region), latest end is row9 (2's region). So 10 rows. Output would have10 lines. But that's not possible. Because the test output examples have varying numbers of lines, but the test input's output needs to be in the same format as the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of lines in the output is the maximum number of contiguous rows covered by any of the regions. For example, the 8's region is contiguous rows6-8 (3 rows). 5's is rows1-3 (3). 2's is rows7-9 (3). 1's is rows0-1 (2). So maximum contiguous is3. So output lines3. Each line is [8,5,2,1]. So three lines.\n\nBut example0's output has5 lines. The regions there have non-contiguous rows? No. 8's region is rows1-3, 4's rows2-5, 6's rows3-5. The union of rows1-5. So 5 rows. So the output lines are5. So maybe the output lines are the total number of rows covered by all regions, from the earliest to the latest, inclusive. So for test case: earliest row0, latest row9. 10 rows. But example0's earliest row1, latest row5: 5 rows. Output5 lines. That would fit.\n\nBut in example1, earliest row0, latest row7. 8 rows. Output9 lines. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps the output lines are the count of rows from earliest to latest plus1. No.\n\nAlternatively, the output lines are the difference between the latest row and earliest row plus1. For example0:5-1+1=5. Which matches. For example1:7-0+1=8, but output is9. Not matching. \n\nBut in the test case, earliest row0, latest row9. 9-0+1=10. So output would be10 lines. But the training examples don't follow this. For example3: earliest row3, latest row5. 5-3+1=3. Output3 lines. Yes. Example5: earliest row2 (1's region), latest row6 (4's region). 6-2+1=5. But output is3 lines. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given that time is limited, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the numbers and order, and for the number of lines, take the maximum vertical span of any region. For the test case, each region has a vertical span of3 rows. So output would have three lines of [8,5,2,1].\n\nBut let's look back at the training examples to see if this makes sense. Example5's output has3 lines. The regions for 1 are3 rows, 4 are2 rows, 8 is1 row. So max is3. Output has3 lines. Yes. Example3's output has3 lines. Region spans3 rows. Yes. Example4's output has3 lines. The regions for 2 and3 each span2 rows, but output is3. So no. So this approach might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of lines is the sum of the vertical spans of all regions. But example0's sum would be 3+4+3=10. Output is5 lines. No.\n\nPerhaps the number of lines is the number of rows in the largest individual region's vertical span. For example0, 4's region is4 rows. Output5 lines. So no.\n\nGiven that time is pressing, perhaps the correct answer is to list the numbers ordered left to right based on their regions' leftmost columns, and the number of lines is the maximum vertical span of any region. For the test case:\n\nRegions:\n\n8: vertical span3 rows.\n\n5:3 rows.\n\n2:3 rows.\n\n1:2 rows.\n\nMax is3. So three lines.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n[8,5,2,1]\n\n[8,5,2,1]\n\n[8,5,2,1]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs are ordered left to right. So this seems possible.\n\nBut let's check example5's output:\n\nRegions 1,4,8.\n\nLeftmost columns:\n\n1: column1.\n\n4: column3.\n\n8: column7.\n\nOrder is [1,4,8]. Output is three lines. Which matches their maximum vertical span (3 rows for1). So yes.\n\nSo applying that logic to the test case, the output would have three lines of [8,5,2,1].\n\nBut wait, in the test case, the leftmost regions are:\n\n8 is column0.\n\n5 is column1.\n\n2 is column3.\n\n1 is column7.\n\nSo the order is [8,5,2,1]. \n\nThus, the output would be three lines of that list.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, each output line is the same list, repeated. So for example0, five lines of [4,6,8]. So for the test case, three lines of [8,5,2,1].",
