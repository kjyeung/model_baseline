        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a 10x10 grid, and the output is another 10x10 grid. The numbers in the grids are mostly 0s, with some 2s, 5s. The goal is to see how the input transforms into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. Let's compare the input and output. The input has a 5 in the first row at position 3 (0-based index 3). In the output, that 5 seems to have moved down two rows. Like in row 0, column 3 becomes 0 in the output, and in row 2, column 3, there's a 5. Wait, but looking at the output for Example 0, the 5 in the input's first row (row 0) moves to row 2 in the output. But also, there's another 5 in the fourth row (row 3) at column 8 in the input. In the output, that 5 is now in row 3, column 5. Hmm, maybe it's moving down and to the right? Wait, maybe there's a direction here. Alternatively, maybe the 5s are moving down by certain steps unless there's a 2x2 block in the way.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the fourth row (row 3) has a 2,2 block starting at column 3. Then in the output, that 5 from row 3, column 8 is now in row 3, column 5. Wait, perhaps the 5s are moving to the right until they hit something. Or maybe the 5s are moving in a specific direction and when they encounter a 2x2 block, they wrap around or change direction?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the 5s in the input and where they end up in the output. Let's list all the 5s in each example's input and see their positions in the output.\n\nFor Example 0 Input:\n- Row 0, column 3 (value 5)\n- Row 3, column 8 (value 5)\n- Row 7, column 7 (value 5)\n\nIn the Output:\n- The row 0, column 3 5 is now at row 2, column 3 (so two rows down)\n- The row 3, column 8 5 is now at row 3, column 5 (so three columns left)\n- The row 7, column 7 5 is not present in the output. Wait, in the input of Example 0, there's a 5 in row 7, column 7. But the output has a 5 in row 5, column 5. Wait, maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nWait in Example 0's input, the 5s are at:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,5,0,...]\nRow 3: [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,5,0]\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nOutput for Example 0:\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,5,...]\nRow 3: [...,5 at column5? Let me see. The third row of output is [0,0,0,2,2,5,0,...], so 5 is at column5.\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,5,...]\nSo, the original 5 in row3, column8 (input) moves to row3, column5 in output. That's a left shift by 3. The 5 in row7, column7 (input) moves to row5, column5? Because output row5 has a 5 in column5. Wait, how does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all 5s are moving diagonally down and left. Let's see:\n\nRow 0, column3 \u2192 row2, column3: moved down 2, same column. That's not diagonal.\n\nRow3, column8 \u2192 row3, column5: same row, moved left 3.\n\nRow7, column7 \u2192 row5, column5: moved up 2, left 2. Hmm, that's a diagonal movement. Maybe the movement direction depends on something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being moved to the next available position in a certain direction, but blocked by 2x2 blocks.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output.\n\nExample 1 Input 5s:\n\nRow0, column8 (5)\nRow3, column1 (5)\nRow6, column9 (5)\nRow8, column5 (5)\n\nOutput:\n\nRow1, column7 (5)\nRow3, column4 (5)\nRow4, columns5 and 7 (5s)\nSo the input 5s are moving in different directions. For instance, the row0, column8 5 in input moves to row1, column7 (down 1, left1). The row3, column1 5 in input moves to row3, column4 (same row, right3). The row6, column9 5 moves to row4, column5 (up2, left4). The row8, column5 5 in input moves to row4, column7 (up4, right2). This seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are moving towards the nearest 2x2 block. Let's see. The 2x2 blocks in the input might influence the movement of the 5s.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2x2 block is in rows3 and4, columns3 and4. The 5 in row0, column3 moves down to row2, column3. Maybe moving down until it's adjacent to the 2x2 block. The 5 in row3, column8 is moving left to column5, which is next to the 2x2 block's right side. Wait, the 2x2 block ends at column4 (since it starts at 3, two elements). So column5 is next to the block. Similarly, the 5 in row7, column7 moves up and left to row5, column5, which might be near the 2x2 block.\n\nIn Example1, the 2x2 blocks are in rows2 and3, columns5 and6. The input has a 5 in row0, column8. The output moves it to row1, column7. Maybe moving towards the 2x2 block. The distance would be row0 to row2 (difference 2), column8 to column5 (difference 3). So moving down 1 and left1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are moving towards the center of the grid. The center is around row4.5, column4.5. Let's see:\n\nIn Example0, input row0, column3 (5) is at row0. Moving down to row2. That's closer to center. The original position is row0, moving towards center (row4.5). Similarly, the 5 in row7, column7 would move towards the center. Moving up to row5 (from7 to5) and left from7 to5. So that's moving towards center.\n\nIn Example1, input row0, column8: moving down1 and left1 to row1, column7. Closer to center. The 5 in row3, column1 moves right3 to column4. Closer to center column. The 5 in row6, column9 (far right) moves up2, left4 to row4, column5. Closer to center. The 5 in row8, column5 moves up4 (row4) and right2 (column7). Hmm, but row4, column7 is not exactly the center. Maybe it's moving in steps towards the center.\n\nIf that's the case, each 5 moves one step towards the center. Wait, but in Example0's first 5: row0 to row2. That's two steps down. Maybe each 5 moves two steps towards the center each time. Let's check:\n\nCenter is at (4.5,4.5). For a 5 at (row, col):\n\nDirection towards center would be: move vertically and horizontally towards center. So, if row <4.5, move down; if row>4.5, move up. Similarly for columns: if column <4.5, move right; else move left.\n\nFor Example0's first 5: row0, column3. row0 <4.5 \u2192 move down. How much? Maybe moving 2 steps down. So row0+2= row2. Column3: 3 <4.5 \u2192 move right. 3+2=5. But in output, column3 remains 3. Wait, in the output, the 5 is at row2, column3. So maybe only moving vertically, not horizontally? Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 5 moves in a diagonal direction towards the center. For example, moving diagonally down-right if it's in the top-left quadrant, etc. But in Example0's row0, column3 5 is in the top part. To move towards center, it would move down. Column3 is left of center, so move right. So combined, down and right. But in the output, it moved down two rows but same column. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are moving in a specific direction based on their original position. For example, all 5s move down and to the right, but if blocked by a 2x2 block, they adjust. Let's look at Example0's input. The 5 in row0, column3 moves down to row2, column3. If moving down and right, maybe two steps down. But why same column? Maybe the horizontal movement is blocked by the 2x2 block. The 2x2 block is in rows3-4, columns3-4. So the 5 in row0, column3 is moving down. If moving down two steps, it would be at row2, column3. Then, perhaps the next step would be to the right, but the block is in row3. Maybe it stops before hitting the block.\n\nBut how about the other 5 in row3, column8? It moves left to column5. Maybe that's moving left towards the center. Column8 is far right. So moving left to column5 (three steps). The 2x2 block is in columns3-4. So moving to column5 would be adjacent to the block's right side. Maybe the 5s are moving towards the nearest 2x2 block and then stopping next to them.\n\nIn Example0's input, there are two 2x2 blocks: one in row3-4, columns3-4. So the 5 in row0, column3 moves down towards the block. The 5 in row3, column8 moves left towards the same block. The 5 in row7, column7 moves up and left towards the same block.\n\nIn the output, the 5s are placed adjacent to the 2x2 blocks. For example, the 5 from row0, column3 ends up in row2, column3, which is two rows above the block. Wait, the block starts at row3. So row2 is adjacent to the block's top. The 5 in row3, column8 moves to column5, which is to the right of the block (block ends at column4). So column5 is adjacent. The 5 in row7, column7 moves to row5, column5, which is adjacent to the block's bottom and right.\n\nHmm, maybe the 5s are moving towards the nearest 2x2 block and stopping at the nearest possible cell adjacent to the block. But how is \"nearest\" determined? Let's see.\n\nIn Example1's input, there's a 2x2 block in rows2-3, columns5-6. The 5s in input:\n\nRow0, column8 (5): the nearest block is in rows2-3, columns5-6. The distance is (0-2.5)=2.5 rows down, and 8-5.5=2.5 columns left. So the direction is down and left. So moving towards that block. In output, this 5 moves to row1, column7. That's one step down and one left. Maybe only moving a certain number of steps.\n\nAnother 5 in input of Example1 is row3, column1. The block is at columns5-6, so column1 is to the left. So the nearest block is in columns5-6. So the 5 would move right towards the block. In output, this 5 moves to row3, column4. Which is right next to the block (columns5-6 are the block, so column4 is adjacent to the left of the block).\n\nAnother 5 in input is row6, column9. The block is at rows2-3. So the 5 is below the block. So moving up towards the block. Column9 is right of the block (columns5-6). So moving left towards the block. The output for this 5 is row4, column5. So up 2 rows (from6 to4) and left4 columns (from9 to5). That's adjacent to the block's bottom (row4 is next to row3) and left (column5 is next to column5 of the block's left edge, which starts at 5).\n\nAnother 5 in input is row8, column5. The block is at rows2-3, columns5-6. So the 5 is below and in line with the block's columns. Moving up towards the block. The output for this 5 is row4, column7. So up4 rows (from8 to4) and right2 columns (from5 to7). Hmm, column7 is adjacent to the block's right (columns5-6 end at 6, so 7 is next). But row4 is two rows below the block (which is rows2-3). So perhaps this 5 is moving towards the block but ends up adjacent to the right side of the block's column.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe each 5 is moving towards the nearest 2x2 block, moving in a straight line towards it, and stops at the nearest possible position adjacent to the block. The direction could be calculated by moving towards the block's center.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are moving to the cell that's diagonally adjacent to the 2x2 block in the direction of their original position. For example, if the 5 is to the north of the block, it moves down to the row above the block. If it's to the east, moves left to the column next to the block, etc.\n\nBut there can be multiple 2x2 blocks. Wait, in the examples, each input has exactly one 2x2 block. Let me check:\n\nIn Example0's input, the 2x2 blocks are in rows3-4, columns3-4 (the first one) and maybe another in rows3-4, columns3-4 again. Wait, looking at input rows3 and4:\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,5,0]\nRow4: [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo that's a 2x2 block at (3,3) to (4,4). Then in Example0's input, the other 2x2 block? No, maybe only one. So each input has one 2x2 block. So the 5s are moving towards that block.\n\nSo the rule might be: for each 5 in the input, move it towards the 2x2 block and place it adjacent to the block in the direction from which the 5 came. For example, if the 5 is to the north of the block, place it one cell north of the block. If it's northeast, place it in the northeast adjacent cell, etc.\n\nLet's test this with Example0.\n\nIn Example0's input, the 2x2 block is centered around rows3.5, columns3.5. The 5s are at:\n\n- (0,3): north of the block. So the output places it at (2,3), which is two cells north of the block. Wait, the block starts at row3. So adjacent north would be row2. But the output places it at row2, which is adjacent. So why not row2, column3? Because the block's north edge is row3. So adjacent is row2. So moving the 5 from row0 to row2, directly north of the block.\n\nAnother 5 is at (3,8): east of the block. The block's columns are 3-4. So the 5 is in column8, east. The adjacent cell to the east of the block would be column5 (since block ends at column4). Wait, the block is columns3 and4. So east adjacent is column5. The output places the 5 at (3,5). So it's moved to the east adjacent of the block, same row as the block. So maybe the 5 is moved along the same row to the east side of the block.\n\nThird 5 is at (7,7): southeast of the block. The block is at rows3-4, columns3-4. The 5 is in row7, column7. So moving towards the block, but the nearest edge is the south edge of the block (row4). So adjacent south would be row5. But the output places this 5 at row5, column5. So perhaps it's moved diagonally to the southeast adjacent cell of the block. Wait, the block's southeast adjacent cell would be row5, column5 (since the block ends at row4 and column4). So that's one step south and east from the block's bottom-right corner. So maybe the 5 is moved to that position.\n\nIn Example1's input, the 2x2 block is at rows2-3, columns5-6. Let's check the 5s:\n\nRow0, column8: east of the block. So moving towards the block. The adjacent east side would be column7, but the block's east edge is column6. So adjacent east is column7. But in the output, this 5 is placed at row1, column7. So one step west and down from the original position. Hmm, maybe it's moved to the southwest adjacent of the block? The block's northeast corner is row2, column6. So southwest adjacent would be row3, column5. But that's part of the block. Wait, no. Alternatively, the 5 is coming from northeast (row0, column8), so the direction towards the block would be southwest. So the adjacent cell would be north of the block's east side. Maybe not. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are moving in such a way that their final position is the closest possible cell adjacent to the 2x2 block, considering the direction they came from. For each 5, the direction towards the block's center is determined, and they are placed in the nearest cell adjacent to the block in that direction.\n\nFor example, in Example0's (0,3) 5: the block's center is (3.5,3.5). The direction from the 5 to the block is south. So the closest adjacent cell to the block in the south direction is row3, column3.5 (but that's the block itself). Maybe instead, the 5 is placed on the side of the block that's closest to its original position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are moving towards the block's center and are placed in the first adjacent cell along that path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 5 is moved to the closest possible position adjacent to the 2x2 block, but not overlapping with it. The movement could be vector-based. For example, for a 5 at position (x,y), compute the vector towards the block's center (dx, dy), then move in that direction until reaching an adjacent cell.\n\nBut how is this computed? Let's take Example0's (0,3) 5. The block's center is (3.5, 3.5). The vector from (0,3) to (3.5,3.5) is (3.5, 0.5). So the direction is mostly down. The 5 is moved down until it reaches row2, which is adjacent to the block's top (row3). So moved 2 rows down, same column.\n\nAnother 5 in Example0 is at (3,8). Vector to block's center (3.5,3.5) is (0.5, -4.5). So direction is left. The 5 is moved left until column5, which is adjacent to the block's right (column4 +1 =5). So moved 3 columns left.\n\nThe third 5 in Example0 is at (7,7). Vector to block's center is (-3.5, -3.5). So direction is up and left. Moving in that direction, it reaches row5, column5, which is adjacent to the block's bottom-right (row4, column4). So from (7,7) to (5,5), moving 2 up and left, which brings it to the adjacent cell.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1:\n\nBlock is at rows2-3, columns5-6 (center at 2.5,5.5).\n\n5 at (0,8): vector to center is (2.5, -2.5). So direction is down and left. Moving in that direction, the closest adjacent cell would be row1, column7 (down1, left1), which is adjacent to the block's east side (columns6, but column7 is east of the block). Wait, but the block's east edge is column6. So adjacent east is column7. But the 5 is placed at row1, column7. So that's north of the block's east edge. So maybe it's placed one cell north and east of the block's northeast corner. Not sure.\n\nBut in the output for Example1, this 5 moves to row1, column7. The block's northeast corner is row2, column6. So moving one up and one right from there would be row1, column7. That's adjacent to the northeast of the block.\n\nAnother 5 in Example1's input is at (3,1). Vector to block's center (2.5,5.5) is (-0.5, 4.5). So direction is up and right. The closest adjacent cell would be row3, column5 (right side of the block). But the output has this 5 at row3, column4, which is left of the block. Hmm, maybe moving towards the block's left edge. The block's left edge is column5. So moving from column1 to column4 (4 steps right) would get to column5's left adjacent cell (column4). So the 5 is placed at row3, column4, which is adjacent to the left of the block.\n\nThe 5 at (6,9) in input moves to row4, column5. Vector to block's center is (2.5-6= -3.5,5.5-9= -3.5). So direction is up and left. The closest adjacent cell would be row4, column5. Which is one row below the block's bottom (row3) and column5 is the block's left edge. So adjacent to the block's bottom-left.\n\nThe 5 at (8,5) moves to row4, column7. Vector to block's center (2.5,5.5) is (-5.5, 0.5). So direction is up and right. Moving up 4 rows (from8 to4) and right 2 columns (5 to7). Column7 is adjacent to the block's right (columns6). So row4, column7 is adjacent to the block's right side, four rows below the block. Wait, no. The block is in rows2-3, so row4 is one row below the block. So the 5 is placed adjacent to the block's south side, right edge.\n\nThis seems to be the pattern. Each 5 is moved to the closest cell adjacent to the 2x2 block, along the direction from their original position to the block's center. The movement seems to be such that each 5 is placed in the nearest adjacent cell to the block, possibly in the direction of their original position.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // Row0\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]  // Row1\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // Row2\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // Row3\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // Row4\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // Row5\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]  // Row6\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // Row7\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // Row8\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // Row9\n\nFirst, identify the 2x2 block. Looking for consecutive 2s in adjacent rows and columns. The rows6 and7 have 2,2 in columns2 and3. So the 2x2 block is at rows6-7, columns2-3. The center of this block is at row6.5, column2.5.\n\nNow, each 5 in the input must be moved to the adjacent cell of this block in the direction from their original position to the block's center.\n\nLet's list all the 5s:\n\nRow0, column2 (5)\nRow1, column8 (5)\nRow6, column7 (5)\nRow9, column2 (5)\n\nNow, for each of these 5s, determine the direction towards the block's center (row6.5, column2.5).\n\n1. Row0, column2 (5):\n   - The block is at row6.5, column2.5.\n   - Vector from (0,2) to (6.5,2.5): down 6.5 rows, right 0.5 columns.\n   - Direction is mostly down, slightly right.\n   - The closest adjacent cell to the block in this direction would be above the block? Or south. Wait, the block's top edge is row6. So from row0, moving down towards row6.5. The adjacent cell to the block in the south direction would be row8, but the block is rows6-7. So the adjacent cells are row5 (north), row8 (south), column1 (west), column4 (east), etc.\n\nWait, the block is rows6-7 (so rows6 and7) and columns2-3 (columns2 and3). So the adjacent cells are:\n\n- North: row5, columns2-3.\n- South: row8, columns2-3.\n- West: rows6-7, column1.\n- East: rows6-7, column4.\n- Also, the four diagonals: e.g., row5, column1 (northwest), etc.\n\nBut the 5 at row0, column2 is north of the block. The direction to the block's center is straight down. So the closest adjacent cell would be the northern adjacent of the block. The block's north edge is row6, so the northern adjacent cell is row5, columns2-3. But since the block is 2x2, the northern adjacent cells would be row5, columns2 and3. So the 5 from row0, column2 would be placed at row5, column2 or3, whichever is closer.\n\nBut the original position is column2. So moving down from row0 to row5, same column. But row5, column2 is adjacent north of the block's column2. So placing the 5 at row5, column2.\n\nBut wait, the block's northern adjacent cells are row5, columns2 and3. The 5's original column is2, so placing it at row5, column2.\n\nAnother 5: Row1, column8. The block is at row6.5, column2.5. Vector from (1,8) to (6.5,2.5) is (5.5 rows down, -5.5 columns left). So direction is southwest. The closest adjacent cell to the block in this direction would be the northeast of the block's southwest adjacent. Wait, perhaps moving towards the southwest direction would reach the west or south side of the block. Let me think. The block's south edge is row7. The west edge is column2. So moving southwest from (1,8) would go towards the block's southwest corner (row7, column2). The adjacent cell to the block's southwest would be row7, column1 (west) or row8, column2 (south). But the movement is southwest. So the nearest adjacent cell would be row7, column2 (which is part of the block) so the adjacent cell would be south (row8, column2) or west (row7, column1). Alternatively, perhaps the 5 is placed at the nearest adjacent cell in the direction of the vector. Since the vector is southwest, the nearest cell would be the west side of the block. So column1, rows6-7. But in the output of Example0 and1, sometimes the 5s are placed in diagonal adjacents. Alternatively, maybe this 5 is moved to row6, column4 (east of the block) if moving diagonally. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at other examples. In Example0's 5 at row0, column3 moved down to row2, column3 (north adjacent). In Example1's 5 at row0, column8 moved to row1, column7 (southwest adjacent to the block). So maybe in this case, the 5 at row1, column8 would move southwest towards the block's center. The block is at row6.5, column2.5. So from row1, column8, moving southwest would go down and left. The nearest adjacent cell to the block in that direction is row7, column2 (southwest corner of the block). But since the block is at columns2-3, the southwest adjacent would be row7, column1 (west) or row8, column2 (south). Alternatively, the 5 could be placed at row7, column1 or row8, column2. Or maybe row6, column2 (northwest adjacent). But according to the training examples, maybe it's placed in a diagonal adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is moved to the southwest adjacent cell of the block. For example, the block's southwest adjacent cell is row7, column1 (west) or row8, column2 (south). But which one? Perhaps the movement is such that the 5 moves as much as possible along the direction vector. The direction vector is (5.5, -5.5), which is a slope of -1. So the path is along the line y = -x + c. The 5 would move along this line until it reaches the block's adjacent cell.\n\nBut calculating that path: starting at (1,8), moving southwest until hitting the block's adjacent cell. The first cell along that line would be (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2). At (7,2), that's adjacent to the block's west side (column2 is part of the block). So the adjacent cell would be row7, column1 (west). So placing the 5 at (7,1). But wait, the block is at row7, column2-3. So row7, column1 is west adjacent. Alternatively, perhaps the 5 is placed at (7,2), which is part of the block. No, the block is columns2-3. So row7, column2 is part of the block. So the adjacent cell would be column1. So the 5 would be placed at row7, column1. But looking at the training examples, maybe this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5 moves to the nearest available adjacent cell. The distance from (1,8) to the block's various adjacent cells:\n\n- North: row5, columns2-3: distance is sqrt((5-1)^2 + (2-8)^2) = sqrt(16 + 36) = sqrt(52) \u22487.21\n- South: row8, columns2-3: distance sqrt((8-1)^2 + (2-8)^2) = sqrt(49+36)=sqrt(85)\u22489.21\n- West: rows6-7, column1: distance sqrt((6-1)^2 + (1-8)^2)=sqrt(25+49)=sqrt(74)\u22488.6\n- East: rows6-7, column4: sqrt((6-1)^2 + (4-8)^2)=sqrt(25+16)=sqrt(41)\u22486.4\n- Northeast: row5, column4: sqrt((5-1)^2 + (4-8)^2)=sqrt(16+16)=sqrt(32)\u22485.66\n- Southwest: row7, column1: sqrt((7-1)^2 + (1-8)^2)=sqrt(36+49)=sqrt(85)\u22489.21\n\nThe closest adjacent cell is the east side (column4). Wait, but direction is southwest. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5 is moved to the east adjacent of the block, which is column4. For example, in Example1's input, the 5 at row0, column8 was moved to row1, column7 (which is east adjacent of the block's east side). But in that example, the block was in columns5-6, so east adjacent is column7. So maybe the 5 is moved to the east adjacent cell. For the current test case, the block's east adjacent is column4. So the 5 at row1, column8 would move to row6, column4 (east of the block). But row6 is part of the block. So the east adjacent would be row6, column4. So placing the 5 there.\n\nBut in Example1, the 5 at row0, column8 moved to row1, column7 (which is east adjacent of the block's east edge). So perhaps this pattern holds. So in the test input, the 5 at row1, column8 (far east) would move west towards the block's east side. The block's east side is column3, so the east adjacent is column4. So moving the 5 from row1, column8 to row6 or7, column4. But the direction is southwest. Hmm, this is getting too ambiguous.\n\nLet's try to proceed step by step.\n\nFor the test input's 2x2 block (rows6-7, columns2-3):\n\nEach 5 needs to be placed adjacent to this block. The 5s are at:\n\n1. Row0, column2: north of the block.\n   - The block's north adjacent cells are row5, columns2-3.\n   - The 5 is in column2, so moving down to row5, column2.\n\n2. Row1, column8: east and above the block.\n   - The block's east adjacent cells are columns4 in rows6-7.\n   - The 5 is far east, so moving west towards the block's east side.\n   - May move to row6, column4 or row7, column4.\n\n3. Row6, column7: east of the block (same row as the block's top row).\n   - The block's east adjacent is column4. So moving west from column7 to column4.\n   - But this 5 is in row6, column7. The block is in columns2-3. So east adjacent is column4. So moving to row6, column4.\n\n4. Row9, column2: south of the block.\n   - The block's south adjacent cells are row8, columns2-3.\n   - The 5 is in row9, column2. Moving north to row8, column2.\n\nNow, applying this:\n\n- Row0, column2 \u2192 row5, column2\n- Row1, column8 \u2192 row6, column4 or row7, column4. Let's see in training examples. In Example0, a 5 in row3, column8 moved to column5 (east adjacent) of the block. In Example1, a 5 at row0, column8 moved to row1, column7. So perhaps for this test case, the 5 at row1, column8 would move to the east adjacent of the block, which is column4. But since the block is rows6-7, column4. So perhaps moving to row6, column4.\n\n- Row6, column7: same row as the block. The block is in columns2-3, so column7 is east. Moving west to the block's east adjacent (column4). So row6, column4.\n\n- Row9, column2: moving north to row8, column2.\n\nBut wait, in Example0's input, the 5 at row7, column7 (south of the block) moved to row5, column5. Hmm, but in that case, the block was in rows3-4. The 5 was in row7, column7. So moved to row5, column5 (adjacent to the south of the block's east side). So perhaps the movement isn't directly north/south but towards the block's center.\n\nIn the test case's row9, column2: the vector from (9,2) to (6.5,2.5) is (-2.5 rows, 0.5 columns). So direction is up and slight right. The adjacent cell would be south of the block. The block's south edge is row7. So the south adjacent cell is row8, columns2-3. The 5 is in column2, so placing it at row8, column2.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nThe transformed grid would have 5s at:\n\n- Row5, column2\n- Row6, column4\n- Row6, column4 (from row6, column7)\n- Row8, column2 (from row9, column2)\n\nWait, but the row6, column7 5 is another 5. Let's reevaluate. The 5 in row6, column7 is part of the input. The block is in rows6-7, columns2-3. So this 5 is in the same row as the block's top row (row6), column7 (east of the block's columns). So the direction to the block's center (row6.5, column2.5) is down0.5 rows and left4.5 columns. So moving left towards the block. The adjacent cell would be the east side of the block (column4). So placing it at row6, column4.\n\nAnother 5 in row6, column7: so moving left to column4. So this 5 would be at row6, column4.\n\nThe 5 in row9, column2: moving north to row8, column2.\n\nSo the output should have 5s at:\n\nRow5, column2 (from row0, column2)\nRow6, column4 (from row6, column7 and possibly row1, column8)\nRow8, column2 (from row9, column2)\nAnd what about row1, column8?\n\nFor row1, column8: the direction is towards row6.5, column2.5. So moving southwest. The adjacent cell could be row7, column2 (block's west edge). But row7, column2 is part of the block. So adjacent west is column1. So row7, column1.\n\nBut in Example1, the 5 at row6, column9 (input) was moved to row4, column5. Which is diagonally adjacent to the block's southeast. So perhaps the 5 from row1, column8 in the test input would be moved to row7, column1.\n\nBut this is getting too ambiguous. Let's look at the training examples to see if there's a pattern in how the 5s are moved.\n\nIn Example0:\n\nInput 5s:\n\n- Row0, column3 \u2192 output row2, column3 (two down)\n- Row3, column8 \u2192 output row3, column5 (three left)\n- Row7, column7 \u2192 output row5, column5 (two up, two left)\n\nIn Example1:\n\n- Row0, column8 \u2192 output row1, column7 (down1, left1)\n- Row3, column1 \u2192 output row3, column4 (right3)\n- Row6, column9 \u2192 output row4, column5 (up2, left4)\n- Row8, column5 \u2192 output row4, column7 (up4, right2)\n\nObserving these, the movement seems to be that each 5 moves a number of steps such that it ends up adjacent to the block. The steps depend on the distance to the block. For example, the 5 at row0, column3 in Example0 moves down 2 steps to row2, column3 (adjacent north of the block). The 5 at row3, column8 moves left 3 steps to column5 (adjacent east of the block's right edge).\n\nIn the test input, for the 5 at row1, column8:\n\nThe block's center is row6.5, column2.5. The distance is (6.5-1) =5.5 rows down and (2.5-8)= -5.5 columns. So the direction is down and left. The nearest adjacent cell in that direction would be row7, column2 (but that's part of the block), so perhaps move to row7, column1 (west adjacent). Or row8, column2 (south adjacent). Alternatively, since the direction is diagonal, maybe the 5 moves to row7, column3 (south of the block's east side). But that's part of the block.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the 5 is in row1, column8, which is far to the east. The block's east adjacent is column4. So moving west from column8 to column4, which is 4 steps. But how many rows down? The block is at row6.5. So row1 to row6.5 is 5.5 steps. Maybe moving down 5 rows and left 4 columns: row1 +5 = row6, column8-4=4. So row6, column4. That would place the 5 at row6, column4, which is east adjacent to the block (column4 is east of the block's column3).\n\nIn Example1's input, the 5 at row6, column9 (far east) moved to row4, column5 (up2, left4). So similar pattern.\n\nSo for row1, column8 in test input: moving down (6.5-1=5.5 rows) and left (8-2.5=5.5 columns) towards the block. But since we can't have fractions, perhaps move 5 rows down and 5 columns left: row1+5=6, column8-5=3. But column3 is part of the block. So adjacent to east side (column4).\n\nAlternatively, move 5 rows down (row6) and left 5 columns (column3). But column3 is part of the block. So place at column4 (east adjacent). So row6, column4.\n\nThis matches with the previous 5 from row6, column7 moving to row6, column4. So two 5s in the same cell? But looking at the training examples, each input 5 is moved to a unique cell. So perhaps in the test input, the 5 at row6, column7 and row1, column8 would both move to row6, column4, but that would result in two 5s in the same cell. But in Example0's output, there are multiple 5s in different positions. So maybe overlapping is allowed.\n\nBut in the training examples, the output doesn't have overlapping 5s. So perhaps each 5 is moved to a unique cell adjacent to the block. So perhaps the 5 at row1, column8 is moved to a different adjacent cell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 at row1, column8 is moved to row7, column4 (east adjacent of the block's south side). Or row7, column4. \n\nAlternatively, considering the direction vector (down5.5, left5.5), the 5 could move down5 and left5 to reach row6, column3. But column3 is part of the block. So move to column4.\n\nSo row1+5=6, column8-5=3 \u2192 row6, column3. But column3 is part of the block. So move to column4. So row6, column4.\n\nThus, the 5 from row1, column8 would be at row6, column4. The 5 from row6, column7 would also move to row6, column4. So they would overlap. But in training examples, overlapping is not observed. So perhaps this is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Each 5 is moved to the closest adjacent cell to the block, in the direction of their original position.\n\nFor the 5 at row1, column8:\n\nThe closest adjacent cells are:\n\n- East: row6, column4 (distance sqrt((6-1)^2 + (4-8)^2)=sqrt(25+16)=sqrt(41)\u22486.4)\n- South: row8, column2 (distance sqrt(7^2 +6^2)=sqrt(85)\u22489.21)\n- West: row6, column1 (sqrt(5^2+7^2)=sqrt(74)\u22488.6)\n- North: row5, column2 (sqrt(4^2 +6^2)=sqrt(52)\u22487.21)\n\nThe closest is east adjacent (row6, column4). So the 5 moves there.\n\nThe 5 at row6, column7 is in the same row as the block's top row. The direction to the block's center is left. So moving left to column4 (east adjacent of the block). So row6, column4.\n\nBut this would result in two 5s at the same cell. However, in Example0's output, there are multiple 5s in different positions. So maybe overlapping is allowed. But in the training examples, outputs don't have overlapping 5s. Example0's output has three 5s in different positions. So perhaps in the test case, the two 5s from row1, column8 and row6, column7 would both end up at row6, column4. But that's not allowed, so maybe there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 5 is moved to the closest available adjacent cell, and if multiple 5s target the same cell, they are placed in the nearest possible cells. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5 from row6, column7 (which is part of the block's row) is moved west to the block's east adjacent. So row6, column4. The 5 from row1, column8 is moved to row7, column4 (south of the block's east adjacent).\n\nBut this is just guessing. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the best possible answer based on the patterns observed.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe transformed test input should have 5s at:\n\n- Row5, column2 (from row0, column2)\n- Row6, column4 (from row1, column8 and row6, column7)\n- Row8, column2 (from row9, column2)\n\nBut since two 5s are moving to row6, column4, perhaps one of them is placed elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the 5 from row6, column7 is moved to row6, column4, and the 5 from row1, column8 is moved to another cell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5 from row1, column8 is moved to row7, column4 (south of the block's east adjacent).\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to be certain. Given the training examples, I'll proceed with the following output:\n\nTest output:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // Row5, column2\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // Row6, column4\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // Row8, column2\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAdditionally, the 5 from row1, column8 would move to another adjacent cell. For example, row7, column4:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // Row7, column4\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut this would require adding two more 5s. However, the training examples only have one 5 per cell. So perhaps the 5 from row1, column8 moves to row7, column4, and the 5 from row6, column7 moves to row6, column4. Then, the output would have three 5s:\n\nRow5, column2\n\nRow6, column4\n\nRow7, column4\n\nRow8, column2\n\nBut that's four 5s. However, the input has four 5s. So this is possible.\n\nBut looking back at the training examples, in Example0's output, there are three 5s. In Example1's output, there are three 5s. So the number of 5s remains the same as the input.\n\nThus, in the test input, four 5s should be present in the output. The challenge is to determine their positions.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with the following answer based on the pattern observed.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have these grids with numbers 0, 2, and 5. The input and output in the training examples show some transformation. Let me look at the examples closely.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has some 5s and 2s. The output seems to have moved some of those 5s. Let's compare the input and output for each row.\n\nIn the input's first row, there's a 5 at position 3 (0-based index). In the output, the 5 is now in the third row (index 2) at position 0, but wait, no. Let me check again. Oh, looking at the output's third row (index 2), the 5 is at position 3. Hmm, maybe it moved down? Wait, the original 5 in the input's first row (row 0) is at column 3. In the output, it's in row 2, column 3. So that's moving down two rows. But why?\n\nWait, another 5 in the input's fourth row (row 3) at column 8. In the output, that's now at row 3, column 5. So that's moving to the left. And another 5 in row 7, column 7. In the output, it's in row 5, column 5. Hmm, maybe there's a pattern where the 5s are moving in a certain direction based on their position relative to the 2x2 blocks of 2s.\n\nLooking at the first example's input: There's a 2x2 block in row 3 and 4, columns 3 and 4. The 5 in row 0, column 3 is above this block. In the output, that 5 moves down two rows to row 2, same column. Then the 5 in row 3, column 8 (to the right of the 2x2 block) moves left into the same row as the 2x2 block, next to it. The 5 in row 7, column 7 moves up two rows to row 5, column 5. So maybe the 5s are moving towards or around the 2x2 blocks?\n\nWait, in the output of example 0, the 5s are placed next to the 2x2 blocks. The original 5 in row 0, column 3 (above the 2x2) moves down to row 2, column 3 (still same column, two rows down). The 5 in row 3, column 8 (to the right of the 2x2) moves left to row 3, column 5 (same row as the 2x2's end). The 5 in row 7, column7 moves up to row5, column5. Maybe the 5s are being positioned diagonally relative to the 2x2 blocks?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are moving in the direction that the 2x2 blocks are \"pushing\" them. Like, if a 5 is adjacent to a 2x2 block, it's moved in a certain direction. Let's check example 1.\n\nIn example 1's input, there's a 2x2 block in rows 2 and 3, columns 5 and 6. The 5 in row 0, column8 (top right) might be moving. The output shows a 5 at row 1, column7. So that's moving left and down. The 5 in row3, column1 (left of the 2x2?) moves to row3, column4 (right of the 2x2?), inserting into the same row but shifted. Another 5 in row6, column9 (bottom right) maybe moves up, but in the output, there's a 5 in row4, column5 and row4, column7. Also, a 5 in row8, column5 in the input moves to row4, column5. So maybe 5s are moving towards the 2x2 blocks and placed adjacent?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being moved to the next available position in a certain direction when they are in the same row or column as a 2x2 block. Let's think about the movement direction.\n\nLooking at example 0's input again: The 5 in row0, column3 (top) is above a 2x2 block starting at row3. But in the output, this 5 is moved down to row2, column3. Wait, the 2x2 is in rows 3 and 4. So maybe the 5s above the 2x2 are moved down to the row just above the block? Because row3 is the start of the block, so row2 is just above. Similarly, the 5 in row7, column7 (input) is moved up to row5, column5. But why row5? Maybe there's a different 2x2 block affecting that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all 5s are being moved to the closest possible position adjacent to a 2x2 block. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 2x2 blocks are acting as \"attractors\" and the 5s are moving towards them in a certain direction. For example, 5s above a 2x2 block move down to the row just above, those to the right move left into the same column as the block's end, etc.\n\nIn example 0, the first 5 is above the 2x2 block (rows3-4, columns3-4). The 5 is moved down to row2 (same column). Then another 5 is in row3, column8 (to the right of the block), which moves left to column5, same row. The third 5 in row7, column7 moves up to row5, column5. Maybe that's related to another 2x2 block? Wait, in the input of example0, there's another 2x2 block? No, the input's other rows have zeros. Wait, the input of example0 has two 2x2 blocks? Let me check again. No, in the input, row3 and row4 have 2s in columns3-4. So one 2x2 block. The 5 in row7, column7 is not near any 2x2 block. But in the output, it's moved to row5, column5. Maybe that's a diagonal move towards the center? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are being shifted in a spiral or some specific direction. Alternatively, the 5s are moving down, left, or up based on their original position relative to the 2x2 blocks.\n\nIn example1, the 2x2 block is in rows2-3, columns5-6. The input has a 5 at row0, column8 (top right). The output places it at row1, column7. So moving down and left. Another 5 in row3, column1 (left side of the 2x2 block) moves to row3, column4 (right before the block's columns). The 5 in row6, column9 (bottom right) in the input moves to row4, column5 and 7? Or maybe another 5 in row8, column5 moves to row4, column5. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 5 is being moved in a certain direction (like down, left, up, right) based on their position relative to the 2x2 blocks. For instance:\n\n- If a 5 is above a 2x2 block, move down until it's just above the block.\n- If to the right, move left into the block's column.\n- If below, move up into the same column.\n- If to the left, move right into the block's column.\n\nBut how to determine which block affects which 5? Maybe the nearest 2x2 block?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are moving towards the center of the grid. But that might not fit.\n\nWait, let's look for another pattern. The output in example0 has 5s in positions that are adjacent to the 2x2 blocks. For example, the 2x2 block in rows3-4, columns3-4. In the output, there's a 5 in row3, column5 (same row, next to the block), another in row5, column5 (below?), but maybe that's from a different 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being placed in the same row or column as the 2x2 blocks but shifted. For example, the 5 in row0, column3 moves to row2, column3 (same column, two rows down), which is two rows above the 2x2 block's starting row. The 5 in row3, column8 moves to row3, column5 (same row, left three positions), which is adjacent to the 2x2 block's end (columns3-4, so column5 is next). The 5 in row7, column7 moves to row5, column5, which is two rows up and two columns left. Maybe that's moving towards the center of the grid?\n\nAlternatively, considering that 5s are moving in a specific direction (like all moving down, left, etc.), but that doesn't fit both examples.\n\nWait, in example1's output, the 5 in the input's row8, column5 (which is below the 2x2 block in rows2-3, columns5-6) moves up to row4, column5. So that's four rows up. The 5 in row6, column9 (input) becomes row4, column7. So moving up two rows and left two columns. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are moving to the nearest edge of the 2x2 block. For example, if a 5 is above a block, it moves down to the top edge's row. If to the right, moves left to the right edge's column. If below, moves up to the bottom edge's row. If to the left, moves right to the left edge's column.\n\nIn example0's input, the 5 in row0, column3 is above the 2x2 block which starts at row3. The top edge of the block is row3. So the 5 moves to row2 (just above the block). The 5 in row3, column8 is to the right of the block (which ends at column4). So the right edge is column4. So moving left to column5 (which is adjacent to column4). Wait, column8 to 5? That's three positions left, but the block ends at column4. So column5 is adjacent to the block's end. So perhaps that's correct.\n\nThe 5 in row7, column7 in the input: maybe there's another 2x2 block? But there isn't. Wait, the input's row7, column7 is 5. The output moves it to row5, column5. Maybe that's moving towards the center of the grid, which is at row4.5, column4.5. So from row7 to row5 (up two), column7 to 5 (left two). That's a diagonal movement towards the center.\n\nIn example1, the 5 in row0, column8 (input) moves to row1, column7 (down one, left one). Another 5 in row3, column1 (input) moves to row3, column4 (right three). The 2x2 block is in columns5-6. So column4 is adjacent to the block's left. So moving right to column4.\n\nThe 5 in row6, column9 (input) moves to row4, column7 (output row4, column7). So moving up two, left two. The center of the grid is row4.5, column4.5, so moving towards center again.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that each 5 in the input moves towards the center of the grid, but if there's a 2x2 block, they are placed adjacent to the block. Alternatively, the 5s are moving towards the center, and their movement is adjusted if they are near a 2x2 block.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all 5s move diagonally towards the center (row4.5, column4.5), moving one step up and left, or down and right, depending on their original position. Let's check:\n\nIn example0's input, the 5 in row0, column3 (top) would move towards the center. The center is around row4.5, so moving down. Column3 is left of center (4.5), so moving right. But in the output, it moves down two rows to row2, same column. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This approach isn't working. Let's try a different angle.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the 2x2 blocks remain in the same positions. So the transformation only affects the 5s. The 5s are moving, and the 2x2 blocks stay.\n\nSo the key is how the 5s are being transformed relative to the 2x2 blocks.\n\nAnother observation: In example0's output, the 5s are placed either adjacent to the 2x2 blocks or in positions that form a diagonal. For example:\n\n- The 2x2 block is in rows3-4, columns3-4. The 5 in row3, column5 (output) is to the right of the block. The 5 in row2, column3 is above. The 5 in row5, column5 is below and to the right.\n\nIn example1's output:\n\n- The 2x2 block is in rows2-3, columns5-6. The 5s are at row1, column7 (upper right), row3, column4 (left), row4, column5 and 7 (below and right).\n\nWait, maybe the 5s are being placed in all four directions around the 2x2 blocks. Like one above, one to the right, one below, one to the left. But the number of 5s varies. Example0's input has three 5s, output has three. Example1's input has four 5s, output has four.\n\nBut in example1's input, there's a 5 in row8, column5. In the output, it's moved to row4, column5. That's directly above, but in the same column. The 2x2 block is in columns5-6. So perhaps the 5 is placed in the same column as the block, but a certain number of rows above or below.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 5 is moving to a position that's diagonally adjacent to a 2x2 block. For instance, in example0, the 5 in row0, column3 is above the block and moves to row2, column3 (same column, two rows down). The 5 in row3, column8 is to the right of the block and moves left to column5 (same row as the block's row). The 5 in row7, column7 moves to row5, column5, which could be diagonally two steps up and left towards the block.\n\nBut how to determine the direction and distance?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 5 moves to the nearest position adjacent to a 2x2 block. For example, if a 5 is not adjacent to a block, it moves towards the nearest block's edge.\n\nBut this would require checking the distance. Let's see:\n\nIn example0, the 5 at (0,3) is three rows above the block's top (row3). It moves down to row2, which is one row above the block. So the distance reduces by two rows. The column stays the same.\n\nThe 5 at (3,8) is in the same row as the block (row3), but column8. The block ends at column4, so it's four columns to the right. It moves left to column5, which is adjacent to the block's end (column4). So moving left three columns.\n\nThe 5 at (7,7) is not near any block. In the output, it's at (5,5). Perhaps this is moving towards the center or another block that isn't present. But there's no other block, so maybe there's another rule here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a 5 is not near any 2x2 block, it moves towards the center of the grid. The center is around row4.5, column4.5. So from (7,7), moving towards center would be up and left. From row7 to row5 (two steps up), column7 to 5 (two left). That matches.\n\nIn example1, the 5 at (0,8) moves to (1,7), which is down one, left one. (0,8) is far from any block (the block is at rows2-3, columns5-6). So moving towards the center: from row0 to row1 (down), column8 to7 (left). Similarly, the 5 at (6,9) moves to (4,7) (up two, left two). The 5 at (8,5) moves to (4,5) (up four rows, same column). That's moving towards the center. But why same column? Because column5 is the center column.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the rule is: 5s that are adjacent to a 2x2 block are moved to a position adjacent to the block. 5s that are not adjacent are moved towards the center of the grid, either in a straight line or diagonally.\n\nBut how to determine which direction they move. For example, in example1's input, the 5 at (3,1) is to the left of the block in columns5-6. It moves to column4 in the same row. So moving right three columns to get to column4, which is adjacent to the block's left edge (column5). So that's moving towards the block.\n\nThe 5 at (8,5) is in column5, same as the block's column5. But rows8 is far below. So it moves up to row4, which is closer to the center.\n\nSo combining these observations:\n\n- For each 5, check if it's near a 2x2 block. If yes, move it to an adjacent position relative to the block (left, right, above, below).\n- If not near a block, move towards the center of the grid.\n\nBut how to define \"near\"? Maybe within certain rows or columns. Alternatively, if the 5 is in the same row or column as a 2x2 block, but not adjacent, then move towards it. Otherwise, move towards the center.\n\nAlternatively, for any 5, the movement depends on the nearest 2x2 block. For example:\n\n- If the 5 is in the same column as a block's column range and above the block, move down to the row just above the block.\n- If to the right of the block's column range and in the same row as the block's row, move left to the column just after the block's end.\n- If below the block's row range and same column, move up to the row just below the block.\n- If to the left of the block's column range and same row, move right to the column just before the block's start.\n- If no block in the same row or column, move towards the center.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's see if this applies to the examples.\n\nExample0's input:\n\n5 at (0,3). The block is in rows3-4, columns3-4. So the 5 is in column3, which is part of the block's columns. It's above the block (row0 < row3). So move down to row just above the block (row3-1 = row2). So (2,3). Which matches the output.\n\n5 at (3,8). The block is in row3, columns3-4. The 5 is in row3, column8. So same row as the block. The block's columns are 3-4, so the 5 is to the right. So move left to column5 (block's end is column4, so adjacent column is 5? Wait, block ends at 4, so adjacent column would be 5. But moving from column8 to 5 would be a big jump. But in the output, it's moved to column5. So perhaps moving to the first column after the block's end. But that's column5. So moving from 8 to 5? That doesn't fit. Unless the movement is based on some other rule.\n\nWait, maybe the 5 in row3, column8 (same row as block) is moved left until it's adjacent to the block's right edge. The block's right edge is column4. So adjacent would be column5. So moving from column8 to column5. So left three steps. But why three? Not sure. Maybe the movement is to the nearest position adjacent to the block in that row. So moving to column5.\n\nIn example1's input, the 5 at (3,1) is in the same row as the block (rows2-3). The block is in columns5-6. So the 5 is to the left. So moving right to column4 (adjacent to the block's left edge, which is column5). So from column1 to column4. That's three steps right. So why? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a 5 is in the same row or column as a block, but not adjacent, it moves directly to the edge of the block. For example, if in the same row and to the right of the block, move left to the block's right edge +1.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary. Let's see.\n\nAnother approach: For each 5 in the input, the output's position is determined by the following steps:\n\n1. Find all 2x2 blocks in the input.\n2. For each 5, check if there's a 2x2 block in the same row or column.\n3. If in the same row, move the 5 to the nearest column adjacent to the block.\n4. If in the same column, move the 5 to the nearest row adjacent to the block.\n5. If not in the same row or column, move the 5 towards the center of the grid.\n\nLet's test this with example0:\n\n5 at (0,3). There's a block in column3-4 (rows3-4). So same column as the block's columns. So this 5 is in column3. The block's rows start at 3, so the nearest row adjacent to the block would be row2 (above). So move down from row0 to row2. Column stays 3. Which matches the output.\n\nAnother 5 at (3,8). Same row as the block (row3). The block's columns are 3-4. So the 5 is in column8, same row. Move to column5 (adjacent to the block's end, column4). So column4+1=5. So move to column5. Which matches the output.\n\nThird 5 at (7,7). There's no block in row7 or column7. So move towards center. Center is (4.5,4.5). From (7,7), moving up and left. So row7-2=5, column7-2=5. (5,5), which matches the output.\n\nThat seems to fit.\n\nNow example1:\n\nInput 5 at (0,8). There's a block in rows2-3, columns5-6. The 5 is in row0, column8. So same column as the block's columns (5-6)? No, column8 is outside. So not same row or column. So move towards center. From (0,8), center is (4.5,4.5). Moving down and left. So maybe move to (1,7). Which is what's in the output.\n\nAnother 5 at (3,1). Block in rows2-3, columns5-6. The 5 is in row3, column1. Same row as the block. The block's columns are5-6. So the 5 is in column1, same row. Move to column4 (adjacent to the block's left edge, which is column5-1=4). So move to column4. In the output, it's at (3,4). Yes.\n\nAnother 5 at (6,9). No block in row6 or column9. So move towards center. From (6,9), center is (4.5,4.5). So up two rows to row4, left five columns to 4.5. But the output has it at (4,5) and (4,7). Wait, in example1's output, there's a 5 at row4, column5 and row4, column7. How does that fit?\n\nWait, let's check example1's input again. The input has a 5 at row6, column9. The output has a 5 at row4, column7. So from (6,9) to (4,7). That's moving up two and left two. Towards the center. Makes sense.\n\nAnother 5 in input row8, column5. There's a block in columns5-6. So the 5 is in column5, same as the block's columns. The block is in rows2-3. The 5 is in row8, which is below the block. So move up to row4 (adjacent to the block's rows, which end at row3. So adjacent row would be row4). So from row8 to row4. Column stays 5. Which matches the output's row4, column5.\n\nYes, this seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\nFor each 5 in the input:\n\n- If there's a 2x2 block in the same row or column:\n\n   - If same row: move the 5 to the column adjacent to the block's nearest edge (left or right).\n\n   - If same column: move the 5 to the row adjacent to the block's nearest edge (top or bottom).\n\n- If not in the same row or column, move the 5 two steps towards the center (up/down and left/right as needed).\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nLet's list the 5s and their positions:\n\nRow0, column2: 5.\n\nRow1, column8:5.\n\nRow6, column7:5.\n\nRow9, column2:5.\n\nNow, check for 2x2 blocks. Looking at the test input:\n\nRow6 and 7, columns2-3: 2s. So there's a 2x2 block at rows6-7, columns2-3.\n\nOther rows are all zeros. So that's the only block.\n\nNow, for each 5:\n\n1. Row0, column2 (5):\n\n   Check if it's in the same row or column as any block.\n\n   The block is in rows6-7, columns2-3.\n\n   This 5 is in column2, which is part of the block's columns (2-3). So same column as the block's columns.\n\n   The block starts at row6. The 5 is in row0, which is above.\n\n   So move the 5 to the row adjacent to the block's top edge. The block's top row is 6, so adjacent row above is 5. So move from row0 to row5, column stays 2.\n\n   But wait, the same column: the block is in columns2-3. So the 5 is in column2, which is part of the block. Wait, no. The block is in columns2-3 (positions 2 and 3). So the 5 is in column2, same column as the block. So same column.\n\n   So the 5 is in column2, which is the block's starting column. So the nearest edge for rows is the block's top row (6). The adjacent row above is 5. So move to row5, column2.\n\n   But wait, the 5 is in column2, which is part of the block. So maybe moving to the row just above the block (row5).\n\n2. Row1, column8 (5):\n\n   Check if in same row or column as the block. Block is rows6-7, columns2-3.\n\n   No same row (row1 vs 6-7) or column (8 vs 2-3). So move towards center.\n\n   Current position (1,8). Center is (4.5,4.5). Moving down and left. So down 3 rows (to row4), left 3 columns (to column5). But the movement is two steps towards the center. Wait, earlier examples moved two steps. Like from (7,7) to (5,5): two steps up and left.\n\n   So from (1,8), moving two steps towards center. Each step would be: down one row, left one column.\n\n   Step1: (2,7)\n\n   Step2: (3,6)\n\n   So final position (3,6). But let's check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe moving two rows down and two columns left: from (1,8) to (3,6).\n\n3. Row6, column7 (5):\n\n   Check same row or column as block. Block is rows6-7, columns2-3.\n\n   The 5 is in row6, same as block's row. Column7 is not part of block's columns (2-3). So same row as block.\n\n   So move to the column adjacent to the block's nearest edge. The block's columns are 2-3. The 5 is in column7, which is to the right of the block. So move left to column4 (block's end is column3, so adjacent column is 4). So from column7 to column4. Same row6.\n\n   So new position (6,4).\n\n4. Row9, column2 (5):\n\n   Check same row or column as block. Column2 is part of block's columns (2-3). So same column.\n\n   The 5 is in row9, which is below the block's bottom row (7). So move up to row8 (adjacent row below the block's bottom is row8). So from row9 to row8, same column2.\n\n   But wait, the block's rows are6-7. The adjacent row below would be row8. So the 5 moves from row9 to row8, column2.\n\n   But in previous examples, when a 5 was in same column as block and below, it was moved to row adjacent to the block's bottom. For example, in example1's 5 at (8,5) moved to (4,5), which was adjacent to the block's row (rows2-3). Wait, but in that case, the block was in rows2-3, and the 5 was in row8, same column. The movement was to row4, which is not adjacent. Hmm. So maybe my previous understanding is incorrect.\n\n   Wait, in example1's input, the 5 at (8,5) is in the same column as the block's column5-6. So same column. The block's rows are2-3. So the 5 is in row8, which is below. So adjacent row would be row4? That doesn't make sense. Wait, the block is in rows2-3, so the row below is row4. So moving to row4. So in example1's case, from row8 to row4. That's a jump of four rows. So perhaps when the 5 is in the same column as the block, but far away, it moves to the adjacent row (above or below the block) regardless of distance.\n\n   So in the test case, the 5 is in row9, column2 (same column as the block's column2). The block is in rows6-7. So adjacent row below the block is row8. So move the 5 from row9 to row8, column2.\n\nSo applying these transformations:\n\nThe test input's 5s would be:\n\n1. (0,2) \u2192 (5,2)\n\n2. (1,8) \u2192 (3,6)\n\n3. (6,7) \u2192 (6,4)\n\n4. (9,2) \u2192 (8,2)\n\nNow, we need to check if these positions are possible. Let's also check if any of the new positions are overlapping with existing non-zero numbers. For example, the 2x2 block is in rows6-7, columns2-3. So the new positions (6,4) is okay, as long as it's not overlapping.\n\nNow, building the output grid:\n\nStart with all zeros. Then:\n\n- Place 5 at (5,2)\n\n- Place 5 at (3,6)\n\n- Place 5 at (6,4)\n\n- Place 5 at (8,2)\n\nBut wait, the test input also has a 5 in row9, column2. According to the rule, it's moved to row8, column2.\n\nBut let's make sure the steps are correct.\n\nNow, let's write out the output grid based on these positions.\n\nThe output grid would have:\n\nRow5, column2: 5.\n\nRow3, column6:5.\n\nRow6, column4:5.\n\nRow8, column2:5.\n\nAdditionally, the 2x2 block remains in rows6-7, columns2-3.\n\nNow, let's check if these positions collide with the block. The block is in rows6-7, columns2-3. The 5 in row6, column4 is adjacent to the block's right edge (column3+1=4). So that's correct.\n\nThe 5 in row5, column2 is above the block (row6), same column. That's correct.\n\nThe 5 in row3, column6 is in a different area. The 5 in row8, column2 is below the block.\n\nSo the final output should reflect these positions.\n\nNow, let's format the output as per the examples.\n\nEach row is a list of 10 elements, 0s except where 5s are placed and the existing 2x2 block.\n\nSo the output rows would be:\n\nRow0: all 0s.\n\nRow1: all 0s.\n\nRow2: all 0s.\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] \u2192 column6.\n\nRow4: all 0s.\n\nRow5: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column2.\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column4. Also, the block starts here (columns2-3 are 2s). So row6 should have 2s in columns2-3, and a 5 in column4.\n\nWait, the block in rows6-7, columns2-3 is part of the input and remains. So the output must include the 2x2 block in those positions.\n\nSo row6: [0,0,2,2,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, original input's row6 is [0,0,2,2,0,0,0,5,0,0]. So the 2s are already there, and the 5 in column7. The output's row6 after transformation would have the 5 moved to column4. So row6 in output would be [0,0,2,2,5,0,0,0,0,0], and row7 would remain [0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nWait, the 2x2 block is in rows6 and7, columns2 and3. So in the output, those remain as 2s.\n\nSo, for row6, the input's 5 at column7 is moved to column4. So row6 becomes:\n\n[0,0,2,2,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7 remains with 2s in columns2-3, and no 5s here.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nLet's construct each row:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,0,2,2,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (from row9, column2 moving to row8, column2)\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, the test input's row9 has a 5 at column2. According to the pattern, it's moved to row8, column2. So row8, column2 becomes 5. So row8 would be [0,0,5,0,...], and row9 becomes all zeros.\n\nBut wait, the test input's row6 and7 already have the 2x2 block. So in the output, those rows remain as such except for the 5 in row6, column4.\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,2,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but the 5 from row1, column8 (test input) is moving to (3,6). So row3, column6 is 5.\n\nThe 5 from row0, column2 moves to row5, column2.\n\nThe 5 from row6, column7 moves to row6, column4.\n\nThe 5 from row9, column2 moves to row8, column2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final output should have the 5s in those positions and the 2x2 block in rows6-7, columns2-3.",
