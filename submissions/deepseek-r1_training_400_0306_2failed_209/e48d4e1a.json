        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has a lot of rows where the fourth element (index 3) is 2, except the first two rows which have a 5 in the last position. The output has rows with a 2 in the second position (index 1), except the eighth row which is all 2s. Wait, in the input's seventh row (index 6?), there's a full row of 2s. In the output, that full row moves to the eighth row (index 8?), and the other rows have 2 in position 1. So maybe the full row in the input is moved to a different row in the output, and others are shifted?\n\nExample 1: Input has a full row of 4s in the fourth row (index 3). The output has the full row in the sixth row (index 5?), and other rows have 4 in position 0. Wait, the output rows start with 4, except the sixth row which is all 4s. Hmm. The input's full row is in row 3 (0-based index 3), and the output's full row is in row 6 (index 6). Wait, in example 1's input, the full row is row 3 (since the input is 10 rows?), and the output's full row is row 6. Wait, but the output in example 1 has the full row at row 6 (index 6), and the other rows have 4 at index 0. So maybe the full row's position in the input determines where it is in the output? Or maybe the value determines the shift.\n\nLooking at example 0: the value is 2, and the full row in input is row 6 (0-based?), and in the output, the full row is row 8. Wait, input's row 6 (if counting from 0) would be the seventh row. But the output's full row is at row 8 (ninth row). Hmm, that's a shift of +2. But example 1's input full row is at row 3 (fourth row), output is row 6 (seventh row), which is a shift of +3. Maybe the shift depends on the value?\n\nWait, example 0's value is 2. Shift is +2 (from 6 to 8). 2+6=8? No, 6+2=8. Example 1's value is 4. Input full row is row 3. Output row 6. 3 + 3 =6. So 4's shift is 3? That's not directly matching. Alternatively, maybe the value divided by something. 2/2=1, shift 2? 4/ something? Maybe not.\n\nLooking at example 2: Input has a full row of 6s in row 4 (index 4). The output's full row is at row 7 (index 7). So shift is +3 (4+3=7). The value here is 6. Hmm, example 0: 2, shift +2. Example1:4, shift +3. Example2:6, shift +3. Example3: Let's check. Example3's input has a full row of 3s in row 2 (index2). Output's full row is row3 (index3). So shift +1. The value is 3.\n\nWait, maybe the shift is based on the value divided by something. Let's see:\n\nExample0: value 2, shift from row6 to row8: shift +2. 2's shift is 2.\n\nExample1: value4, shift from row3 to row6: shift +3. 4's shift is 3.\n\nExample2: value6, shift from row4 to row7: shift +3. 6's shift is 3.\n\nExample3: value3, shift from row2 to row3: shift +1. 3's shift is 1.\n\nHmm, not a straightforward pattern. Let's think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the full row in the input is moved to a row equal to the value's position in some sequence. Or perhaps the output's full row is determined by the value mod 10, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the non-full rows in the input. For example, in example0, the non-full rows have a 2 at position3. The output's non-full rows have 2 at position1. So the non-full elements are shifted left by two positions (from index3 to index1). Similarly, example1: input non-full rows have 4 at index3. Output non-full rows have 4 at index0. So shift from 3 to 0, which is a shift of -3. Or 3 positions to the left. Example2: input non-full rows have 6 at index6. Output non-full rows have 6 at index3. So shift left by 3. Example3: input non-full rows have 3 at index4. Output non-full rows have 3 at index3. Shift left by1. So maybe the shift depends on the value? Let's see:\n\nValue 2: shift left 2 positions (from 3 to1). 3-2=1.\n\nValue4: shift left 3 positions (3-3=0).\n\nValue6: shift left3 positions (6-3=3).\n\nValue3: shift left1 (4-1=3). Wait, in example3, the input non-full rows have 3 at index4. Output at index3. So 4-1=3.\n\nSo for value2, shift left2. Value4: shift left3. Value6: shift left3. Value3: shift left1. Hmm, that's not a clear pattern. Maybe the shift is value//something. Let's see:\n\n2//2=1, but shift left2. 4//2=2, shift left3. No, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is (value divided by 2) minus 1. For 2: 2/2=1 -1=0. No. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the shift amount equals the value divided by some number. For example, 2 shifted left2: 2/1=2. 4 shifted left3: 4/ (4/3?) Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: in the input, the non-full rows have the value in a certain column. Let's see:\n\nExample0: non-full rows have 2 in column3. The output has them in column1. Difference: 3-1=2 (shift left by2).\n\nExample1: input column3 (value4), output column0. 3-0=3. Shift left3.\n\nExample2: input column6 (value6), output column3. 6-3=3. Shift left3.\n\nExample3: input column4 (value3), output column3. 4-3=1. Shift left1.\n\nSo the shift amount seems to be (original column - new column). How is that determined?\n\nOriginal column for the value in input non-full rows:\n\nIn example0, value is 2, and it's in column3.\n\nIn example1, value4 is in column3.\n\nExample2, value6 in column6.\n\nExample3, value3 in column4.\n\nSo the original column is where the value appears in the input's non-full rows.\n\nBut how is the new column determined?\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nFor example0, new column is1. The value is2.\n\nFor example1, new column is0. Value4.\n\nExample2, new column3. Value6.\n\nExample3, new column3. Value3.\n\nHmm. Not obvious. Maybe the new column is (original column - shift), where shift is determined by some rule.\n\nWait, in example0, original column3, new column1. Shift is 2 (left by2). The value is2. So shift equals value. 2=2.\n\nExample1: original column3, shift3 to get to 0. Value4. 3-3=0. Shift is3, which is 4-1=3? Not sure.\n\nExample2: original column6. Shift3 to get to3. Value6. 6-3=3. So shift3. 6/2=3. Maybe shift is value//2.\n\nValue6: 6//2=3. Yes, shift3.\n\nValue2: 2//2=1. But shift was2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, shift is the value's digit sum or something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the new column is determined by the value modulo some number. For example, 2 in column3. New column1. 3-2=1. Value2. 3 -2=1. Maybe new column is (original column - value). But 3-2=1. That gives the new column1. For example1: 3-4= -1. But new column0. Maybe modulo 10? 3-4= -1 \u21929 mod10. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, original column minus (value//something). For example0, value2, original column3: 3-1=2 (value//2=1). But new column1. Hmm, not sure.\n\nThis approach is getting too complicated. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in each example, the output's full row is in a different position. For example0, the full row in input is row6 (0-based index6), output row8 (index8). Example1 input row3, output row6. Example2 input row4, output row7. Example3 input row2, output row3. The shift here seems to be (input row) + (value -1). Let's check:\n\nExample0: input row6, value2. 6 + (2-1) =7. But output row8. No. Alternatively, value is 2: 6 +2=8. Which matches. Example1: input row3, value4. 3+4=7. Output row6. Not matching. Wait, example1 output full row is at row6 (index6), but 3+4=7, which would be index7. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe value divided by something. 4//2=2. 3+2=5. No. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the output's full row is at position equal to the value. Example0: value2, full row at row8. Not matching. Example1: value4, full row at row6. No. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output's full row is in the same position as the original full row plus the value. Or maybe something else.\n\nWait, looking at example3: input full row at row2 (index2), value3. Output full row at row3 (index3). So 2 +1=3. The value is3, so maybe (value -2) gives 1. 2+1=3. But example0: 6+2=8. Value2. So 6 + (2) =8. So maybe the shift is value. Example0: 6 +2=8. Example3: 2+1=3. But 3 is the value. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the full row in output is placed at the row equal to the original row plus the shift determined by the value. Maybe the shift for the full row is (value mod something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the full row in the output is moved down by a certain number of rows based on the value. For example0: from row6 to8, so +2. Value is2. Example1: from row3 to6, +3. Value4. Example2: row4 to7, +3. Value6. Example3: row2 to3, +1. Value3. So maybe the shift is the value divided by 2, rounded down. For example0: 2/2=1, but shift is2. No. 4/2=2. Shift is3. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is the number of unique digits in the input. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's think about the non-full rows first. In each case, the non-full rows in the input have a single occurrence of the value (except for the last element in the first few rows in example0 and example1, which have 5). The output's non-full rows have that value shifted to a different position, and the full row is moved to another row.\n\nLooking at example0, the non-full rows in the input have 2 at index3. The output's non-full rows have 2 at index1. So shifted left by 2 positions. The full row is moved from row6 to row8.\n\nExample1: input non-full rows have4 at index3. Outputs have4 at index0. Shifted left by3. Full row moved from row3 to row6 (shift of +3).\n\nExample2: input non-full rows have6 at index6. Outputs have6 at index3. Shifted left by3. Full row moved from row4 to7 (shift +3).\n\nExample3: input non-full rows have3 at index4. Outputs have3 at index3. Shifted left by1. Full row moved from row2 to3 (shift +1).\n\nSo the shift for the non-full rows seems to be varying. For example0: left2, example1: left3, example2: left3, example3: left1.\n\nBut how is this determined? Let's look at the value and the original position:\n\nFor example0, value2, original index3. Shift left2: new index1. So 3-2=1. The shift amount is2, which equals the value. Value is2.\n\nExample1: value4, original index3. Shift left3: 3-3=0. Shift amount3. 4-1=3? Or 4//something.\n\nExample2: value6, original index6. Shift left3:6-3=3. Shift amount3. 6//2=3.\n\nExample3: value3, original index4. Shift left1:4-1=3. Shift amount1. 3//3=1.\n\nSo there's a pattern here where the shift amount is the value divided by something. For example2, 6 divided by2 gives3. Example1,4 divided by something. 4/ (4/3) is 3. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the shift amount is floor division of the value by a certain number. For example:\n\n- Value2: shift2. 2//1=2.\n- Value4: shift3. 4//1.333=3.\n- Value6: shift3. 6//2=3.\n- Value3: shift1. 3//3=1.\n\nNot a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift amount is the number of letters in the value's name? For example, \"two\" has3 letters, but shift was2. No.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is the value minus the original index. For example0:2-3=-1. No. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the sum of the input rows. The full row is the one with all elements equal to the value. The other rows have one occurrence of the value (except for the first two rows in example0 and example1, which have 5 in the last position). So the non-full rows have the value once. The output's non-full rows have the value once but in a different position.\n\nSo the transformation for non-full rows is moving the value from its original position to a new position, possibly determined by the value itself. Then the full row is moved to a new position in the output.\n\nAnother observation: in each example, the output's full row is placed in a row that is one less than the value. Wait, example0's value2: full row is row8. 8+1=9. Not matching. Example1's value4: full row at6. 6+1=7. Not 4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the row number of the full row in the output is equal to the value. Example0's value2: row8. No. Example1's value4: row6. No. Not matching.\n\nWait, in example3, the full row is moved to row3. Value3. So row3 for value3. That matches. Example0: value2, full row at8. No. Example2: value6, full row at7. No. So only example3 matches.\n\nSo maybe that's a coincidence. Let's think of another angle.\n\nLooking at the test input. The test input has a full row of8s in row3 (0-based index3). The non-full rows have8 in index5. The output should transform these non-full rows by moving the8 to a new position. Let's see the pattern from training examples.\n\nIn example0, the non-full rows have the value in index3. Output has it in index1. Shift left2.\n\nIn example1, index3 to0. Shift left3.\n\nExample2, index6 to3. Shift left3.\n\nExample3, index4 to3. Shift left1.\n\nSo for the test input, the value is8, which is in index5. What shift would apply here?\n\nIf the shift is similar to other examples, perhaps for8, the shift is3. So moving from index5 to5-3=2. So new index2. Then the output's non-full rows would have8 at index2. The full row, which is in row3 (input) would be shifted by, let's see previous examples. For example0, value2: input row6 to output row8 (shift+2). Example1, value4: input row3 to output row6 (shift+3). Example2, value6: input row4 to output row7 (shift+3). Example3, value3: input row2 to output row3 (shift+1). So the shift for the full row seems to vary. For test input value8, full row is in input row3. What's the pattern here? For example0, shift+2 (6\u21928). Example1, shift+3 (3\u21926). Example2, shift+3 (4\u21927). Example3, shift+1 (2\u21923). Not clear. Maybe the shift for the full row is value minus original row. For example0:2-6= -4, but shift was+2. No. Example1:4-3=1, shift+3. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the shift for the full row is based on the value's digit. 8 is a single digit. Maybe the shift is the value itself. 8 would mean shift+8, but original row3 would become 11, which is beyond the 10 rows. So that's impossible. So perhaps modulo 10. 3+8=11 mod10=1. But that doesn't align with previous examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the full row's new position is the value's index in the non-full rows. For example, in the test input, the non-full rows have8 in index5. So the full row is moved to row5. But in example0, non-full rows have value2 in index3. Full row is moved to8. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the full row's new position is the sum of the value and the original position. 8+3=11 mod10=1. Unlikely.\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Maybe I should focus on the non-full rows first. For the test input, value8 is in index5. What shift would apply here?\n\nLooking at previous examples, the shift for the value seems to be:\n\n- Value2: shift left2 (index3\u21921)\n- Value4: shift left3 (3\u21920)\n- Value6: shift left3 (6\u21923)\n- Value3: shift left1 (4\u21923)\n\nSo perhaps the shift is the floor division of the value by2. For example:\n\n2//2=1 \u2192 shift left1? No. Previous examples had shift2 for 2.\n\nWait, maybe the shift is (value divided by 2, rounded down) plus something. For example:\n\nValue2: 2/2=1. Shift left2. So 1+1=2.\n\nValue4:4/2=2. Shift left3. 2+1=3.\n\nValue6:6/2=3. Shift left3. 3+0=3.\n\nValue3:3/2=1.5, floor to1. Shift left1. 1.\n\nSo that seems to fit. For the test input's value8:8/2=4. So shift left4. So original index5 -4=1. So new index1. Then non-full rows would have8 at index1. And the full row would be moved to row3+4=7 (original row3 +4=7). So the full row would be at row7.\n\nLooking at example3's value3:3/2=1.5\u21921. Shift left1. Which matches.\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input:\n\nOriginal non-full rows have8 in index5. Shift left4 (8//2=4). So new index5-4=1. So each non-full row in the input (except the full row) would have8 in index1. The full row (row3 in input) would be moved to row3+4=7 (row7 in output).\n\nLet's check if this matches the previous examples:\n\nExample0: value2. 2//2=1. Shift left1. Original index3. 3-1=2. But in example0, the output non-full rows have2 at index1. Wait, this doesn't fit. So maybe that pattern isn't correct.\n\nHmm, this is conflicting. Maybe the shift is (value divided by 2) rounded up. For example:\n\nValue2: 2/2=1. Shift1. 3-1=2. But in example0, the new index is1, which is3-2=1. So shift2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is value minus original index. For example0:2-3=-1. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift for the non-full rows is the value's digit minus the original index. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the shift amount is the same as the value for even values, and different for odd. For example, 2 is even: shift2. 4 even: shift4? No. Example1's shift was3. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to see the position of the non-full value in output:\n\nIn the training examples, the new index for the non-full value is:\n\nExample0:1.\n\nExample1:0.\n\nExample2:3.\n\nExample3:3.\n\nSo maybe the new index is (value -1). For example0:2-1=1. Yes. Example1:4-1=3, but new index is0. No. Doesn't fit. Example2:6-1=5. New index3. No. Example3:3-1=2. New index3. No.\n\nAlternatively, new index is (original index) - (value //2). For example0:3-1=2. No. The new index is1. 3-2=1. So shift is2. Which matches value2. Example1:3- (4//2)=3-2=1. No, new index0. So shift3. 3-3=0. So shift is3. Which matches value4? Not sure. Example2:6 - (6//2)=6-3=3. New index3. So yes. Example3:4 - (3//2)=4-1=3. So yes. For test input: original index5. value8. 5 - (8//2)=5-4=1. So new index1. So the non-full rows would have8 at index1. And the full row in input is at row3. So 3 + (8//2)=3+4=7. So the full row would be at row7.\n\nLooking back at the examples:\n\nExample0: value2. 3 - (2//2)=3-1=2. But new index is1. Doesn't fit. So this pattern works for example2,3, but not 0,1.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different formula. Let's see example1:4. Original index3. New index0. 3-3=0. So shift3. Which is 4-1=3. So maybe the shift is value-1. Example0:2-1=1. So shift1. But example0's shift was2. Doesn't fit. Example1:4-1=3. Which matches. Example2:6-1=5. Shift5. But actual shift3. No. Example3:3-1=2. Shift2, but actual shift1. No. Not matching.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's think of it as follows: in each example, the output's non-full rows have the value shifted to a position that's the value's index in the input's non-full rows minus some function of the value. Maybe the new index is the value divided by something. For example0, value2: new index1 (2/2=1). Example1, value4: new index0 (4/4=1? No). Example2, value6:6/2=3. New index3. Yes. Example3, value3:3/1=3. New index3. Yes. Test input value8:8/2=4. So new index4? But according to previous examples, example3's value3 was moved to3. So maybe even values are divided by2, odd values by1.\n\nBut example0, value2/2=1. New index1. Yes. Example1, value4/4=1. New index0. Doesn't fit. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for even values, new index is value/2, for odd values, (value-1)/2. But example3: value3 is odd. (3-1)/2=1. New index3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: the new index is the original index minus the value divided by2. For example0:3 -2/2=3-1=2. But new index1. No.\n\nAlternatively, original index minus (value divided by2):\n\nExample0:3 -2/2=3-1=2. New index1. No.\n\nExample2:6-6/2=6-3=3. Which matches new index3.\n\nExample3:4-3/2=4-1.5=2.5, but new index3. Not matching.\n\nHmm. \n\nMaybe the new index is (value modulo 5). For example0:2 mod5=2. But new index1. No. Example2:6 mod5=1. New index3. No.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to see if there's another pattern. \n\nLooking at the output for the non-full rows:\n\nIn example0, the new index is1. The value is2. The output's non-full rows have the value in index1.\n\nExample1: value4 in index0.\n\nExample2: value6 in index3.\n\nExample3: value3 in index3.\n\nSo perhaps the new index is (value -1) divided by2? For example0: (2-1)/2=0.5 \u2192 0. No. Example1: (4-1)/2=1.5\u21921. No. Example2: (6-1)/2=2.5\u21922. No. Example3: (3-1)/2=1. No. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, new index is (value) divided by2, rounded down. Example0:2/2=1. Yes. Example1:4/2=2. No, new index0. Example2:6/2=3. Yes. Example3:3/2=1. No. So for even values, new index is value/2. For example0 and example2, this works. Example1's value4 is even, new index0. 4/2=2, not0. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe for even values, new index is (value/2) -1. For example0:2/2=1-1=0. No. example2:6/2=3-1=2. No. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for even values, new index is (10 - value)/something. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the pattern is that the new index is the value divided by2 for even values and (value-1)/2 for odd. For example:\n\n- 2 (even) \u21921 (2/2=1). Yes.\n- 4 (even) \u21924/2=2. But example1's new index is0. Doesn't fit.\n- 6 (even) \u21923. Yes.\n- 3 (odd) \u2192(3-1)/2=1. Example3's new index3. No.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the new index is determined by the number of times the full row appears in the input. Wait, in example0, full row appears once. New index1. Example1: full row once. New index0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new index is the position where the sum of the digits or something leads to. Not helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, perhaps I should proceed with the following observations:\n\n- The non-full rows have the value moved to a new position. For even values, it seems to be shifted left by half the value. For example:\n\n   - 2 \u2192 left2 \u2192 new index1 (3-2=1).\n   - 6 \u2192 left3 \u2192 new index3 (6-3=3).\n   - 8 \u2192 left4 \u2192 new index1 (5-4=1? No, 5-4=1. So new index1.\n\nWait, if the test input's value8 is in index5, and shift left4 (8/2=4), then 5-4=1. So new index1.\n\nFor example3, value3 in index4, shifted left1. 4-1=3. So new index3.\n\nExample1's value4 in index3 shifted left3 (4/ something) gives 0.\n\nSo perhaps for even values, the shift is value/2. For example:\n\n- 2 \u21922/2=1 \u2192shift left1. But example0's shift was left2. Conflict.\n\nHmm. Maybe the shift is the value divided by2 rounded up. For example:\n\n- 2/2=1 \u2192 shift1. But example0's shift was2.\n- 4/2=2 \u2192 shift2. But example1's shift was3.\n- 6/2=3 \u2192 shift3. Which matches example2.\n- 8/2=4 \u2192 shift4. For test input, 5-4=1.\n\nExample3's value3:3/2=1.5 rounded up to2. So shift left2. 4-2=2. But example3's new index is3. So that doesn't fit. So this approach only works for even values.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Let's assume that for the test input, the non-full rows have8 moved to index1 (5-4=1). Then the full row in input row3 would be moved to row3+4=7 (row7 in output). \n\nSo the output would have the full row of8s in row7, and other rows have8 in index1.\n\nLet's check this against the training examples:\n\nExample0's full row moves from6 to8. 6+2=8. Shift+2. Value2. So 2=2. So shift is value.\n\nExample1's full row moves from3 to6. 3+3=6. Shift+3. Value4. So shift is3, which is 4-1=3.\n\nExample2's full row moves from4 to7. 4+3=7. Value6. 6/2=3. Shift+3.\n\nExample3's full row moves from2 to3. 2+1=3. Value3. 3-2=1.\n\nSo for the test input's value8, if the shift for the full row is8/2=4, then row3+4=7. So full row in row7.\n\nPutting it all together, the test input's output would have:\n\n- Non-full rows (all except row3 in input) have8 at index1.\n- The full row (input row3) is moved to row7.\n\nSo the output would look like:\n\n[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] for non-full rows, but wait. Wait, in example1, the non-full rows have4 at index0. So for value8, if new index is1, then the non-full rows would have8 at index1. Let's see:\n\nEach non-full row in input has8 at index5. After shifting left4, new index1. So each non-full row becomes [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Except the full row, which is moved to row7.\n\nBut wait, in the input test case, the first two rows have5 in index9. But in previous examples, the last element (5) is not considered. For example0's input had5 in some rows, but the output didn't mention them. So perhaps the5 is ignored. So maybe the5 is part of the input but not part of the transformation. So the output ignores the5. Or perhaps the5 is a red herring. So for the non-full rows, only the value (8) is moved, and the5 is removed or set to0.\n\nSo the test input's output would be:\n\nFor each row in input except the full row (row3), the row is transformed by moving8 from index5 to index1. All other elements become0. The full row (row3 in input) becomes row7 in output, filled with8s.\n\nThus, the output would have:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (assuming this was a non-full row, but wait, row3 in the input is the full row. So in the output, the full row is moved to row7. So rows0-9:\n\nRows0-2: same as input, but with8 moved to index1 and others0.\n\nRow3: the full row from input is now at row7.\n\nRow4-9: similar to rows0-2.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\nRow0: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow7: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow8: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow9: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis matches the pattern seen in the training examples, where the non-full rows have the value shifted to a specific index, and the full row is moved to a new row.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 10x10 grid of numbers, and the output is another grid. Let's compare the inputs and outputs to see what's changing.\n\nStarting with Example 0: The input has a row with all 2s (index 6), and in the output, that row is moved to index 8. Also, the first two rows in the input have a 5 at the end, but the output doesn't have those 5s. Instead, the 2s are shifted. Wait, looking closer: The output rows have 2 in the second position for most rows, except the row that was originally all 2s is now in row 8, and another row with 2 in position 3 becomes 2 in position 1.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's related to the position of the all-same number row. In the input of Example 0, row 6 is all 2s. In the output, that row is moved to row 8. Also, other rows that had a 2 in position 3 (index 3) now have a 2 in position 1 (index 1). So perhaps there's a shift based on that.\n\nWait, let's check other examples. In Example 1, the input has a row (index 3) with all 4s. The output moves that row to index 6. And the other rows that had a 4 in position 3 now have 4 in position 0. Similarly, Example 2's input has the all-6 row at index 4, and the output moves it to index 7. The other rows with 6 in position 6 (index 6) now have 6 in position 3 (index 3). Example 3 has the all-3 row at index 2 in input, moved to index 3 in output. The other rows with 3 in position 4 (index4) now have 3 in position 3 (index3).\n\nSo maybe the pattern is:\n\n1. Find the row in the input that's all the same number (except possibly the last element). For example, in Example 0, row 6 is all 2s. Then, in the output, this row is moved down by 2 positions (from row 6 to 8). But wait, in Example 1, the row is at index3 in input and moves to index6 in output, which is +3. Example 2's row moves from index4 to index7 (+3). Example 3's row moves from index2 to index3 (+1). Hmm, that's inconsistent. Wait maybe the shift is determined by the value itself?\n\nWait, example0: value 2, moved from row6 to row8. 8-6=2. The value is 2. Example1: value4, moved from row3 to row6. 6-3=3. Value4... 3 is not 4. Example2: value6, moved from row4 to row7. 7-4=3. 3 vs 6. Example3: value3, moved from row2 to row3. 1. So that doesn't align. Maybe the shift is fixed? Or perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output rows: the all-same row in the output is placed three rows below where it was in the input. For example0: input row6 \u2192 output row8 (difference +2). Example1: input row3 \u2192 output row6 (diff +3). Example2: input row4 \u2192 output row7 (diff +3). Example3: input row2 \u2192 output row3 (diff +1). Hmm, that's varying. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the non-all-same rows. In example0, the input rows (excluding the all-2s row) have a 2 at position3. In the output, those rows have 2 at position1. So maybe a shift left by 2 positions. Because 3-2=1. Similarly, in example1, input rows (excluding all-4s) have 4 at position3. Output has 4 at position0. So 3-3=0. Example2: input rows have 6 at position6. Output has 6 at position3. 6-3=3. Example3: input rows have 3 at position4. Output has 3 at position3. 4-1=3. Wait, no, 4-1=3? Or 4-1=3? Hmm, maybe the shift is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value in the non-full row's position is shifted by a certain amount. For example, in example0, the non-full rows have 2 at index3. The output rows have 2 at index1. So the shift is left by 2 positions. Example1: input has 4 at index3, output at index0 (shift left by 3). Example2: input 6 at index6, output at index3 (shift left by3). Example3: input3 at index4, output at index3 (shift left by1). So maybe the shift is determined by (value - original position) mod something? Or perhaps the shift is (value) modulo 10, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shifted position is (original position - (value / 2)) or something. Let's see:\n\nExample0: value2, original position3. 3 - (2/2) =3-1=2. But output position is1. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is such that the new position is (original position - (value -1)). For example, in example0: 3 - (2-1) =2. Output position1. No. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the output rows where the non-full rows have their number shifted. Let's see:\n\nIn example0, the input non-full rows (except the first two) have 2 at position3. The output rows have 2 at position1. So shift left by 2.\n\nIn example1, input non-full rows have 4 at position3. Output rows have 4 at position0. Shift left by3.\n\nIn example2, input non-full rows have6 at position6. Output has them at position3. Shift left by3.\n\nIn example3, input non-full rows have3 at position4. Output has them at3. Shift left by1.\n\nWait, the shifts are 2,3,3,1. Not sure. Maybe the shift is the value divided by something. 2 \u2192 shift 2. 4 \u2192 shift3. 6\u2192shift3. 3\u2192shift1. Not obvious. Alternatively, the shift is determined by (value) mod 3 or something. Let's see:\n\n2 mod3 is 2 \u2192 shift2. 4 mod3 is1 \u2192 but shift3. No. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is equal to the value divided by 2. 2/2=1, but shift was 2. 4/2=2, but shift3. No. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: Let's see the test input. The input has the all-8 row at index3. Following the previous examples, maybe this row is moved to index3 + something. Let's look at the examples:\n\nIn example0, the all-2 row was at index6, output at8. So +2.\n\nExample1: all4 row at3 \u2192 output6. +3.\n\nExample2: all6 at4 \u2192 output7. +3.\n\nExample3: all3 at2 \u2192 output3. +1.\n\nWait, the shift seems to be (value / 2) rounded up? For example:\n\nvalue2 \u2192 2/2=1 \u2192 shift +2. Maybe not. Or maybe (value) mod something. Or the shift is the value divided by something else.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is (value) divided by 2, but 2/2=1, but the shift was +2. 4/2=2, but shift +3. 6/2=3 \u2192 shift+3. 3/2=1.5 \u2192 shift+1. So maybe floor division: 2\u21921, 4\u21922, 6\u21923, 3\u21921. But in example0, the shift was +2, but 1? Doesn't align. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is the number of distinct elements in the input row. But for the all-same row, it's 1. Other rows may have 0s and the value, so maybe 2 elements. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, look at the output rows for the non-full rows. For example0, in the output, the 2 is at position1. The original was at3. 3-2=1. So 3- (value) =1? 3-2=1. For example1, original position3, value4. 3-4= -1. But the output is position0. Maybe modulo 10. -1 mod10 is9. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the new position is (original position - value) mod10. For example0: 3-2=1 \u2192 mod10 is1, which matches. Example1:3-4= -1 \u2192 mod10 is9. But output is0. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe that's not it. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at example0 input: the rows with 2 in position3 (index3) become rows with 2 in position1 (index1). So difference is -2. For example1, 4 in position3 becomes position0. Difference -3. For example2, 6 in position6 becomes position3. Difference -3. For example3,3 in position4 becomes3 in position3. Difference -1. So shifts are varying. Maybe the shift is (value) divided by 2, rounded down. For example, 2 \u21921, 4\u21922,6\u21923,3\u21921. Then, shift left by that. So original position minus (value//2). Let's check:\n\nExample0:3 - (2//2)=3-1=2 \u2192 but new position is1. No. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, original position minus (value -1). For example0:3 - (2-1)=2. New position is1. No. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, new position is (value - original position). For example0:2-3= -1 \u2192 mod10 is9. No. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the new position is the value's index in the output. Like, for example0, the value is2. The output rows have 2 in position1. So 1 is maybe (value-1). 2-1=1. For example1, value4:4-1=3, but output is position0. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output's position is the original value minus 2. For example0:2-1=1. For example1:4-4=0. Because example1's output has 4 at0. So 4-4=0. Example2:6-3=3. So 6-3=3. Example3:3-0=3, but output is3 at position3. Wait, original value3, new position3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new position is (value //2) -1. For example0:2//2=1-1=0. No, output is1. Not matching.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try another approach. Let's see the structure of the input and output grids.\n\nIn each example, the input has a certain number of rows that have a non-zero value (the same value across all rows) at a certain position, and one row that is entirely that value. The output then has the entire-value row shifted to a different position, and all the other non-zero entries shifted to a different position as well.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\nExample0: Input rows (excluding the full row) have 2 at index3. Output rows have 2 at index1. So shift left by 2.\n\nExample1: Input rows (excluding full row) have4 at index3. Output rows have4 at index0. Shift left by3.\n\nExample2: Input rows (excluding full row) have6 at index6. Output rows have6 at index3. Shift left by3.\n\nExample3: Input rows (excluding full row) have3 at index4. Output rows have3 at index3. Shift left by1.\n\nSo for 2, shift left by2; for4, left3; for6, left3; for3, left1. The shifts are varying. But what's the pattern here?\n\nLooking at the value and the shift:\n\n2 \u2192 shift left 2 \u2192 2 positions.\n\n4 \u2192 shift left3 \u2192 3 positions.\n\n6 \u2192 shift left3 \u21923 positions.\n\n3 \u2192 shift left1 \u21921 position.\n\nHmm. Not obvious. Maybe the shift is (value mod something). For example, 2 mod4=2 \u2192 shift2. 4 mod4=0 \u2192 shift3 (doesn't fit). 6 mod4=2 \u2192 shift3. No.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is (value -1) divided by something. For 2: (2-1)=1 \u2192 shift2. Doesn't fit. For4:3 \u2192 shift3. For6:5 \u2192 shift3. For3:2 \u2192 shift1. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: The original position of the non-zero element (not in the full row) is being adjusted based on the value. Let's see:\n\nIn example0, the original position is3. The value is2. The new position is1. 3 -2=1. So new_pos = original_pos - value.\n\nExample1: original_pos3, value4. 3-4= -1. But the new_pos is0. So maybe modulo10? 3-4= -1 mod10=9. No, output is0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, new_pos = original_pos - (value // something). For example, value2: //2=1. 3-1=2. But output is1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, new_pos = (original_pos - value) mod10. For example0:3-2=1 mod10=1. Correct. Example1:3-4= -1 mod10=9. Output is0. Not matching. So that's not it.\n\nWait, in example1, the output has4 at position0. So how does 3-4= -1 relate to 0? Maybe if we add 10 and then mod10: (3-4 +10) mod10=9. Still not 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new_pos is (original_pos + shift) mod10. But what's shift? For example0, shift is -2. 3-2=1. Correct. Example1, shift-3:3-3=0. Correct. Example2,6-3=3. Correct. Example3,4-1=3. So shifts are -2, -3, -3, -1. How does this relate to the values?\n\nShift for 2 is-2, 4 is-3,6 is-3,3 is-1. Hmm. Maybe the shift is -(value // 1.5) rounded or something. For 2:2//1.5=1.333, rounded to1 \u2192 shift-2. No. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is -(value) for even numbers, but 2\u2192-2, 4\u2192-4. But example1's shift is-3. So not.\n\nAlternatively, for even values, shift is value/2, for odd values, (value+1)/2. For example, 2 is even, shift2/2=1, but the shift is-2. So maybe not.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the full row. For example0, the full row in input is row6. Output moves it to row8. So shift+2. Example1, full row3\u21926: shift+3. Example2, full row4\u21927: shift+3. Example3, full row2\u21923: shift+1. So shifts are +2, +3, +3, +1. How does this relate to the value?\n\nValue2: +2 shift. Value4: +3. Value6: +3. Value3: +1. So the shift for the full row is:\n\n2 \u2192+2\n\n4\u2192+3\n\n6\u2192+3\n\n3\u2192+1\n\nLooking for a pattern here: Maybe the shift is (value /2) rounded up. 2/2=1 \u2192 +2. 4/2=2 \u2192+3. 6/2=3\u2192+3. 3/2=1.5 \u2192 rounded up to 2 \u2192+2, but example3's shift is +1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, shift is (value -1). 2-1=1 \u2192 shift+2. No. 4-1=3 \u2192 shift+3. 6-1=5 \u2192 shift+3. 3-1=2\u2192 shift+1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, shift is (value) // 2. 2//2=1 \u2192 shift+2. 4//2=2\u2192+3. 6//2=3\u2192+3. 3//2=1\u2192+1. So shift is (value//2) +1? For 2:1+1=2. 4:2+1=3. 6:3+1=4, but the shift was +3. Hmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, shift is (value) - (original row index). For example0: 2 -6= -4. But shift is+2. Not making sense.\n\nAnother angle: The full row in the output is placed at the position equal to the value. For example0: value2, output row8. No. 2 isn't 8. Example1: value4, output row6. No. Example2:6\u21927. No. Example3:3\u21923. Yes, here it matches. Hmm. So only example3's full row is moved to the row equal to its value. The others not. So maybe not.\n\nWait, in example3, value3 is moved to row3. So that fits. So for the other examples, if that were the case, value2 would be row2, but in example0, the full row is moved to row8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's try to think of another approach. The outputs have the same structure: the full row is moved to a certain position, and the other rows have the value shifted to a new position, and the rest zeros. Let's see if the shifted position is related to the full row's new position.\n\nFor example0, full row is now at8. The other rows have2 at position1. Maybe 8-7=1? Not sure. Or 8 divided by something. 8/8=1. Not sure. Example1: full row at6. The other rows have4 at0. 6-6=0. That could fit. Example2: full row at7. Other rows have6 at3. 7-4=3. Hmm, maybe. 7-4=3. So (full row index) - (original position of the value in input) gives new position? Let's check:\n\nExample0: full row index8. Original position of value in input rows (excluding full row) is3. 8-3=5. But new position is1. No.\n\nExample1: full row index6. Original position3. 6-3=3. New position0. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Not helpful.\n\nAnother observation: The full row in the output is moved down by a certain number of rows, and the shifted positions of the non-full rows' values are in a position that's up by some amount. Maybe the sum of the shifts for the full row and the value's position in non-full rows is a constant. For example, example0: full row moved down by2 (from6 to8), and the non-full value shifted left by2 (from3 to1). 2+2=4. Example1: full row moved down by3 (3\u21926), non-full shifted left3 (3\u21920). 3+3=6. Example2: full row down3 (4\u21927), non-full left3 (6\u21923). 3+3=6. Example3: full row down1 (2\u21923), non-full left1 (4\u21923). 1+1=2. So no, the sum varies. Not a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the shift of the full row and the shift of the non-full value are the same. Example0: full row shifted+2, non-full shifted-2. Example1: full+3, non-full-3. Example2: full+3, non-full-3. Example3: full+1, non-full-1. Yes! That seems to hold.\n\nIn example0: full row moves down2 rows, non-full value shifts left2 positions (from3\u21921). Example1: full row moves down3 rows (3\u21926), non-full shifts left3 (3\u21920). Example2: full moves down3 (4\u21927), non-full shifts left3 (6\u21923). Example3: full moves down1 (2\u21923), non-full shifts left1 (4\u21923). So the shift for the full row is equal to the shift in position for the non-full elements. So the pattern is:\n\n1. Identify the value (v) that is present in multiple rows (excluding the full row, which is all v).\n\nWait, the full row is all v. The other rows have v at a certain position (e.g., in example0, v=2 is in position3 except the full row). Then, in the output, the full row is moved down by (shift) rows, and the non-full rows have v shifted left by (shift) positions. And the shift is determined by (original position of v in non-full rows) minus (new position) equals shift. For example:\n\nIn example0: original position3 \u2192 new1. Shift=2. Full row moves down2.\n\nIn example1: original3 \u2192 new0. Shift3. Full row moves down3.\n\nIn example2: original6 \u2192 new3. Shift3. Full row moves down3.\n\nIn example3: original4 \u2192 new3. Shift1. Full row moves down1.\n\nSo the shift is determined by the difference between the original and new positions of v in non-full rows. And the full row is moved down by that shift.\n\nSo how is the shift determined? Let's see:\n\nThe shift for the non-full rows is (original position) - (new position) = shift. For example0:3-1=2. Example1:3-0=3. Example2:6-3=3. Example3:4-3=1.\n\nBut how to find the shift from the input? Because in the input, we have the original position (let's call it p) of the non-full v. Then the shift is p - new_p. So how is new_p determined?\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nFor example0: p=3, v=2. new_p=1.\n\nExample1: p=3, v=4. new_p=0.\n\nExample2: p=6, v=6. new_p=3.\n\nExample3: p=4, v=3. new_p=3.\n\nLooking for a relation between p and new_p based on v.\n\nIn example0: new_p=1. 3-2=1. So p -v/2 (v=2) \u21923-1=2. No. 3 - (v) + something.\n\nAlternatively, new_p = p - shift. But shift is p - new_p, so new_p = p - shift. But shift is also the same as the full row's shift.\n\nWait, in example0, shift=2. So new_p=3-2=1. Correct.\n\nExample1: shift=3 \u2192 new_p=3-3=0. Correct.\n\nExample2: shift=3 \u2192 new_p=6-3=3. Correct.\n\nExample3: shift=1 \u2192 new_p=4-1=3. Correct.\n\nYes! So the new_p is p - shift, where shift is the same as the number of rows the full row is shifted down. And the shift is calculated as (v -1) // something?\n\nBut how is the shift determined from the input? Because the shift is the same as the shift for the full row.\n\nThe full row's shift is how many rows down it's moved. For example0, original row6\u21928. Shift is2. Example1:3\u21926. Shift3. Example2:4\u21927. Shift3. Example3:2\u21923. Shift1.\n\nSo the shift for the full row is (new_row - original_row). Now, how is new_row determined?\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nExample0: v=2, full_row_shift=2. 2+6=8. No. 6+2=8. Maybe shift is v. 2\u2192 shift2. But example1: v4\u2192shift3. So no. Alternatively, shift is v//something. For example, 2//1=2, 4// something=3, 6//2=3,3//3=1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the shift for the full row is determined by the number of rows in the input that have the non-zero v (excluding the full row). Let's see:\n\nExample0: the first two rows have v=2 and 5. Wait, in example0's input, the first two rows are [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5]. So their last element is5. Wait, but in example0's input, there are two rows that have 2 and 5, and then the other rows have 2 and 0 except for the full row. But perhaps that's not relevant.\n\nAlternatively, the number of rows with v in the non-full rows. Example0: how many rows have 2 in position3? Let's see the input:\n\nRows 0,1: have 2 at position3 and5 at position9.\n\nRows 2-5,7-9: have 2 at position3 and0 at9.\n\nRow6: full of2.\n\nSo total non-full rows with2: 8 rows (0-5,7-9).\n\nBut I don't see how that affects the shift. Example0's shift is2, but 8 rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternative idea: The shift for the full row is the same as the number of times v appears in the input (excluding the full row). For example0: v=2 appears 8 times (rows0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9?) Wait, let me count.\n\nExample0's input:\n\nRows 0: has 2 at3.\n\nRow1: same.\n\nRow2: has2 at3, and0 at9.\n\nRow3-5: same.\n\nRow7-9: same.\n\nSo rows 0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9: total 9 rows with 2 in position3.\n\nBut the full row is row6. So excluding full row, there are 9 rows with 2. Shift is2. No obvious relation.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's think again about the outputs. The full row in the output is placed in a new row, and the non-full rows have v shifted left by the same shift. So the key is to find what the shift is based on the input.\n\nWait, in example3, the shift is1. The non-full rows have3 at4, shifted to3. So shift is1. The full row is moved from2 to3: shift+1. And in the input, the full row is at2. So shift is1. How is this determined?\n\nAlternatively, the shift is determined by the value's position in the non-full rows. For example0, p=3. shift=2. 3-2=1 (new_p). Example1: p=3. shift=3. 3-3=0. Example2:p=6. shift3. 6-3=3. Example3:p=4. shift1.4-1=3.\n\nBut how is shift calculated from p and v?\n\nMaybe shift is (p - (v mod something)). For example0: p=3, v=2. 3 - (2 mod something). If mod4, 2 mod4=2. 3-2=1. shift=2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, shift = p - new_p. So for example0:3-1=2. So shift is2. Which is the same as the full row's shift. So the shift is determined by how much the non-full rows' v is shifted left, which equals how much the full row is shifted down.\n\nBut how to calculate that shift from the input.\n\nLooking at example0's input: The non-full rows have v=2 at p=3, and the full row is at row6. How is the shift (2) determined from these parameters.\n\nPerhaps the shift is (v). For example0: v=2, shift2. Example1: v=4, shift3. Example2: v=6, shift3. Example3: v=3, shift1. So no, 2,4\u21923,6\u21923,3\u21921.\n\nAlternatively, shift is v divided by something. For example0:2/1=2. Example1:4/1.333=3. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, shift is the ceiling of v divided by2. 2/2=1\u2192ceil1. Shift1. No. Example0's shift is2. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is the number of times the value appears in the input. For example0: v=2. The full row has10 2's, and other rows have one 2 each. So total count is10 +9=19. 19 mod10=9. Not helpful.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for another pattern. For each example, the output's full row is the same value as the input's full row. The non-full rows in the output have the same value as in the input, but shifted. So perhaps the pattern is that the full row is moved down by a certain number of rows equal to the value's position in the non-full rows, and the non-full rows' value is shifted left by the same amount.\n\nBut how to find the shift.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is determined by the original position of the non-full rows' value. For example:\n\nIf p is the original position in the non-full rows, then shift is p minus new_p. So:\n\nExample0:3-1=2.\n\nExample1:3-0=3.\n\nExample2:6-3=3.\n\nExample3:4-3=1.\n\nSo the shift is the difference between original and new positions.\n\nBut how to calculate new_p from p and v.\n\nIn example0, new_p=1. How is1 related to p=3 and v=2. 3-2=1. So new_p= p -v.\n\nExample1:3-4= -1. But new_p is0. Not matching.\n\nExample2:6-6=0. But new_p is3. No.\n\nExample3:4-3=1. new_p3. No.\n\nHmm. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: For example0, the new_p is1. Which is the position of the full row's index (8) minus 7. 8-7=1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, new_p is the full row's new index divided by something. For example0:8 /8=1. new_p is1. Example1:6/6=1. new_p is0. No.\n\nAlternatively, new_p is (full row's new index) modulo something. 8 mod10=8. No. Not.\n\nMaybe it's easier to consider that the shift for the non-full rows is equal to the number of rows the full row is moved down. And that shift is determined by the value's position divided by something. For example, shift= p - new_p, and the full row's new index is original_row + shift.\n\nSo the shift is the same for both operations. The key is to find the shift based on the input.\n\nBut how? Let's try to look for a pattern in the shifts:\n\nExample0: shift2.\n\nExample1: shift3.\n\nExample2: shift3.\n\nExample3: shift1.\n\nThe shifts are 2,3,3,1. The values are2,4,6,3.\n\nMaybe for even values, shift is value/2. For odd values, shift is (value+1)/2.\n\nBut:\n\n2/2=1 \u2192 shift2. No.\n\n4/2=2 \u2192 shift3. No.\n\n6/2=3 \u2192 shift3. Yes.\n\n3: (3+1)/2=2 \u2192 shift1. No.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAnother approach: Looking for the new_p position.\n\nIn example0: new_p=1. Value=2. 1 is 2-1.\n\nExample1: new_p=0. Value4. 0=4-4.\n\nExample2: new_p=3. Value6. 3=6-3.\n\nExample3: new_p=3. Value3.3=3-0.\n\nHmm, that's not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, new_p = v - something. For example0:2-1=1. Example1:4-4=0. Example2:6-3=3. Example3:3-0=3. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The new_p is the original position of the full row minus something. For example0: full row was at6. new_p=6-5=1. Example1: full row was at3. new_p=3-3=0. Example2: full row was at4. new_p=4-1=3. Example3: full row was at2. new_p=2-(-1)=3. Not making sense.\n\nAlternatively, new_p is the original position of the full row modulo something. 6 mod5=1. new_p1. 3 mod3=0. new_p0. 4 mod something=3. 2 mod something=3. Not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I might need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's see:\n\nIn all examples except example3, the new_p for the non-full rows is (original_p - shift). And the shift is equal to the full row's new index - original index. So:\n\nFor example0:\n\nFull row original index6 \u2192 new8. shift=2.\n\nNon-full rows: original_p3 \u2192 new_p3-2=1.\n\nExample1:\n\nFull row original3\u2192new6. shift3.\n\nNon-full:3-3=0.\n\nExample2:\n\nFull row original4\u2192new7. shift3.\n\nNon-full:6-3=3.\n\nExample3:\n\nFull row original2\u2192new3. shift1.\n\nNon-full:4-1=3.\n\nYes, this holds. So the shift is the same for the full row and the non-full rows. The shift is determined by (new index of full row) - (original index of full row). Then, the new_p for non-full rows is original_p - shift.\n\nBut how is the shift determined in the input?\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nExample0: shift=2. What in the input suggests a shift of2?\n\nLooking at the input's full row index6 and other rows with2 at3. 6-3=3. Not 2. Hmm.\n\nExample1: full row index3. Other rows have4 at3. shift3. 3-0=3. But how?\n\nExample2: full row4. Others have6 at6. 4+3=7. So shift3. How?\n\nExample3: full row2. Others have3 at4. shift1. 2+1=3. So the full row's new index is original+shift.\n\nBut how is shift determined? For example0, shift is2. What in the input would lead to that?\n\nWait, the last element in the first few rows of the input. For example0's input, the first two rows end with5. Maybe the shift is determined by that. Like, 5-3=2. So shift=5-3=2. Then new_p=3-2=1. But why5? Not sure.\n\nExample1's input first two rows end with5. But their shift is3. 5-3=2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is the value of the last element in the non-full rows. For example0, the non-full rows except the first two have0 in last position, but the first two have5. But the shift is2, which is not related to5.\n\nAnother idea: The shift is the number of times the value appears in the input. For example0, value2 appears in the full row (10 times) and 9 other rows (one each). Total19. But shift is2. 19 mod something=2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the shift is the value's position in the non-full rows. For example0, p=3. shift3. But example0's shift is2. No.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the pattern is that the full row is moved down by (number of non-full rows with the value) divided by something. For example0, there are 9 non-full rows with2 (assuming rows0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9). 9 divided by something. 9//4=2.25\u21922. Which matches shift2.\n\nExample1: non-full rows with4 are rows0,1,2,5,6,7,8,9 (assuming rows after the full row). Let's see input:\n\nExample1's input has:\n\nRows0,1,2 have4 at3 and5 at9.\n\nThen row3 is full.\n\nRows4-9 have4 at3 and0 at9. So rows4,5,6,7,8,9:6 rows. So total non-full rows with4: rows0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9. 9 rows. 9//3=3. Shift3. Yes.\n\nExample2: non-full rows with6 are rows0,1,2,5,6,7,8,9. Wait input:\n\nExample2's input:\n\nRows0,1,2 have6 at6 and5 at9.\n\nRow4 is full.\n\nRows3,5-9 have6 at6 and0 at9. So rows3,5,6,7,8,9:6 rows. Total non-full rows with6: rows0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9. 9 rows. 9//3=3. Shift3. Correct.\n\nExample3: non-full rows with3 are rows0,1,3-9. Let's see input:\n\nExample3's input:\n\nRow0 has3 at4 and5 at9.\n\nRow1 has3 at4 and0 at9.\n\nRow2 is full.\n\nRows3-9 have3 at4 and0 at9. So non-full rows are rows0,1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. 9 rows. 9//9=1. Shift1. Correct.\n\nAh! So the shift seems to be (number of non-full rows with the value) divided by 3. For example0:9//3=3, but shift is2. Wait, no. Wait in example0, there are 9 non-full rows with2. 9//3=3. But shift is2. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, previous calculations:\n\nExample0: non-full rows with2: rows0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9:9 rows. 9//3=3. Shift is2. Not matching.\n\nExample1:9//3=3. Shift3. Yes.\n\nExample2:9//3=3. Shift3.\n\nExample3:9//9=1. Shift1.\n\nHmm. So example0 is the exception. Maybe it's divided by 4. 9//4=2.25\u21922. Which matches shift2. Example1:9//3=3. Shift3. Example2:9//3=3. Example3:9//9=1. So maybe the shift is (number of non-full rows) divided by (something else). For example0, it's (number of non-full rows) divided by4.5.\n\nNot sure. But given the test input, let's try to apply this pattern.\n\nTest input:\n\nNon-full rows with8. Let's count.\n\nTest input has:\n\nRows0,1:8 at5 and5 at9.\n\nRow3 is full.\n\nRows2,4-9:8 at5 and0 at9. So non-full rows are0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9. Total9 rows.\n\nIf the shift is9//3=3, then the shift is3.\n\nSo the full row in the test input is originally at row3. So new index is3+3=6.\n\nThen, the non-full rows'8, originally at position5, will be shifted left by3 positions:5-3=2. So new_p=2.\n\nSo the output should have the full row at row6, and the non-full rows have8 at position2.\n\nBut let's check the examples to see if this fits.\n\nFor example2, value6, non-full rows have6 at6. Shift3: new_p=6-3=3. Which matches.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nFull row moves from3 to6. Non-full rows have8 shifted from5 to2.\n\nSo the output will have:\n\n- The full row (all8s) at row6.\n\n- The other rows (0,1,2,4,5,7,8,9) will have8 at position2.\n\nRows3 (originally full) is now row6. So let's construct the output.\n\nLet's structure the test input:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: same as row4.\n\nRow6: same as row4.\n\nRow7: same.\n\nRow8: same.\n\nRow9: same.\n\nOutput after shift3:\n\nThe full row (row3) moves to row3+3=6. So row6 becomes all8s.\n\nThe non-full rows (all except row3) will have8 shifted from position5 to5-3=2.\n\nSo each non-full row will have 8 at position2, and the rest 0s. Except for the first two rows, which have5 at position9. But in the training examples, the outputs don't retain the5. So perhaps the5 is ignored. Let's check the training examples.\n\nIn example0's input, the first two rows have5 at9, but the output has0 there. So the pattern seems to be that any elements other than the value being processed are set to0. So in the test case, the first two rows have5 at9, but in the output, those would become0.\n\nSo each non-full row in the output will have8 at position2, and0 elsewhere. The full row (now at6) will be all8s.\n\nSo the output should look like:\n\n[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] for most rows, and the sixth row is all8s.\n\nBut let's structure it according to the test input's rows.\n\nThe original rows in the test input:\n\nRow0: non-full \u2192 output has8 at2.\n\nRow1: same.\n\nRow2: non-full \u21928 at2.\n\nRow3: full \u2192 moved to row6.\n\nRow4: non-full \u21928 at2.\n\nRow5: same.\n\nRow6: originally non-full \u2192 now row6 is the full row. So row6's original content (non-full) becomes row6's new content as full row.\n\nWait, no. The original row3 (all8s) is moved to row6. So in the output, row3 (original) is now row6. The other rows are modified as non-full.\n\nSo the output will have:\n\nRows0,1,2,4,5,7,8,9: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: Now, what was row3 in the input is moved to row6. So row6 becomes all8s.\n\nRow6 (original) was a non-full row (0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0) \u2192 in output, it's row6+3=9? No, wait, the full row is moved down by3. Original row3 becomes row6. The other rows are shifted down, but I think that's not the case. The full row is moved to a new position, and the other rows are modified to have the value at the new_p.\n\nSo in the output, row6 is the full row. The other rows (including the original rows0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9) are modified to have8 at position2.\n\nWait, the original row6 in the test input is [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]. In the output, since the full row is at6, this row (original row6) is now part of the non-full rows and should have8 at position2, which is0,0,8, etc. But the original row6's8 is at position5. Shifting left3 would be position2. So yes.\n\nSo the output will have:\n\nRow0: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: same.\n\nRow2: same.\n\nRow3: (original row3 is now row6) so row3 in output is [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow4: same.\n\nRow5: same.\n\nRow6: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nRow7: same as row0.\n\nRow8: same.\n\nRow9: same.\n\nWait, but original rows3 is the full row. So in the output, row6 is the full row. The other rows (original0-2,4-9) become non-full with8 at position2.\n\nSo the output will have rows0-9 as follows:\n\nRows0,1,2: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow3: same as others.\n\nRow4: same.\n\nRow5: same.\n\nRow6: all8s.\n\nRow7: same as others.\n\nRow8: same.\n\nRow9: same.\n\nSo the full row is at row6. The other rows have8 at position2.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, when the shift is3, the full row is moved down3 rows. For example1, input row3\u21926. Example2, input row4\u21927. For the test input, row3\u21926.\n\nYes. So the output for the test input should have the full row at row6, and other rows have8 at position2.",
