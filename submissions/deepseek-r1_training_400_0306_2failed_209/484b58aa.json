        "cot_1": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern here based on the training examples. Let's look at the first example. The input and output lists look almost the same except for some zeros in the input. For example, in Example 0, the input has sequences like [5,4,5,6,1,2,5,4,5,6,1,2,...] and the output is the same but without the zeros. Wait, looking closer, the input lists have some zeros, like in the fourth input list: [2,1,2,3,4,5,0,0,2,3,4,5,...]. The output for that is the same list but the zeros are replaced with the original numbers that were there before. So maybe the pattern is that wherever there's a sequence of zeros in the input, those zeros are replaced by the original numbers from the non-zero parts of the sequence.\n\nLet me check another example. In Example 1, the first input has a list starting with [0,0,0,0,5,7,...], and the output starts with [3,7,1,2,5,7,...]. Wait, how does that relate? Maybe the zeros are being replaced by elements from earlier in the sequence. Or perhaps the zeros are removed by shifting the subsequent elements to fill the gaps? Hmm, looking at Example 1's first input and output:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,5,7,5,4,2,1,2,2,5,3,2,7,1,2,3,6,2,6,2,1,2,5,2,5,5]\nOutput: [3,7,1,2,5,7,5,4,2,1,2,2,5,3,2,7,1,2,3,6,2,6,2,1,2,5,2,5,5]\n\nThe output starts with 3,7,1,2 instead of zeros. So the zeros are replaced by specific numbers. Maybe the zeros in the input are placeholders that need to be filled in with elements from a certain part of the list. Alternatively, maybe the entire list is part of a cycle, and the zeros are parts that are interrupted and need to be filled to continue the cycle.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input lists have sequences with zeros, like [1,6,1,8,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,4,...], and the output replaces those zeros with the continuation of the pattern. For instance, the input's fifth element has zeros, and the output replaces them with the numbers that continue the sequence (like 1,4,1,6, etc.). So the pattern seems to be that whenever there's a run of zeros in the input, those are replaced by the correct sequence that continues the pattern before the zeros.\n\nSo the general rule might be: in each input list, replace any consecutive zeros with the corresponding elements from the original sequence (without zeros), effectively restoring the original pattern that was interrupted by the zeros.\n\nIn the test input, there are several lists with zeros. For example, the first test input list is [8,1,2,6,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,2,5,1,2,9,...]. The zeros here are four in a row. The original pattern before the zeros is 8,1,2,6,1,2, and after the zeros, it continues with 1,2,5,1,2,9... So perhaps the zeros should be replaced by the continuation of the pattern. But how to determine what that continuation is?\n\nWait, looking at the training examples, the outputs seem to have the same structure but without zeros, and the numbers form a repeating cycle. For example, in Example 0, the outputs are cyclical sequences without interruptions. So the input lists have some zeros where the pattern is broken, and the output fixes that by replacing the zeros with the correct numbers from the cycle.\n\nSo the approach would be to identify the underlying repeating pattern in each list and replace the zeros with the appropriate elements from that pattern. But how to find the pattern for each list in the test input?\n\nLooking at the test input, let's take the first list:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nThe zeros are at positions 6-9. Before the zeros, the sequence is 8,1,2,6,1,2. After the zeros, it's 1,2,5,1,2,9,... Maybe the pattern here is a cycle of 8,1,2,6,1,2, then something else. Wait, after the zeros, there's 1,2,5,1,2,9, which could be part of a different cycle. Alternatively, maybe the entire list is a repetition of a certain sequence, and the zeros are breaks that need to be filled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros in the input lists are replacing parts of a longer repeating sequence, and the output is to restore that sequence by replacing the zeros with the correct numbers.\n\nLooking at the training examples, in Example 0, the output lists are the same as the input lists but with the zeros replaced by the correct numbers. For instance, in the fourth input list of Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 0, 0, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 5]\n\nThe output for that is:\n\n[1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 5]\n\nSo the zeros at positions 6-7 are replaced by 1,2. That suggests that the repeating pattern here is [1,2,5,4,5,6], and the zeros are interrupting that. Therefore, replacing the zeros with the continuation of the pattern.\n\nSo the rule is: for each input list, identify the repeating pattern and fill in the zeros with the appropriate elements from the pattern to continue it.\n\nApplying this to the test input. Let's take the first test input list:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nLooking for the pattern before and after the zeros. Before the zeros (positions 0-5): 8,1,2,6,1,2. After the zeros (positions 10-): 1,2,5,1,2,9, etc. Wait, maybe the pattern is longer. Let's see if there's a cycle.\n\nBut perhaps each list in the test input has its own pattern. For example, the first list might have a pattern that cycles through 8,1,2,6,1,2, then 1,2,5,1,2,9... but that seems inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is split into segments. Alternatively, the zeros are parts that have been replaced and need to be filled with the correct elements from the original sequence.\n\nAlternatively, the input lists are corrupted versions of the output lists, where some elements are replaced by zeros, and the output lists are the original sequences without the zeros. So the task is to restore the original sequence by replacing the zeros.\n\nBut how to know what the original sequence is? It's possible that the output is just the input with all zeros replaced by the correct numbers based on some repeating pattern.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, in Example 0, the outputs are the same as the inputs but with the zeros replaced. For instance, in the sixth input list of Example 0:\n\nInput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 5, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 1]\n\nThe corresponding output is:\n\n[5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1]\n\nHere, the zeros are replaced by elements of the repeating pattern. For example, the initial [5,0,0,0,0,2] becomes [5,4,5,6,1,2], which is part of the repeating sequence 5,4,5,6,1,2.\n\nSo the zeros in the input are parts of the original sequence that have been replaced, and the output is restoring them by inserting the missing elements based on the pattern.\n\nTherefore, the task is to identify the underlying repeating pattern for each list and replace the zeros with the correct elements from that pattern.\n\nFor the test input, each list has its own pattern, and we need to figure out what that pattern is.\n\nLet's take the first test input list:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nLooking at the elements before the zeros (positions 0-5): 8,1,2,6,1,2. After the zeros (positions 10-13): 1,2,5,1,2,9, etc. Let's see if there's a cycle here.\n\nIf the pattern is 8,1,2,6,1,2 followed by 1,2,5,1,2,9, then repeats. But that's not a consistent cycle. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is longer. Alternatively, the zeros need to be replaced by the continuation of the pattern that was before the zeros.\n\nWait, in the training examples, the zeros are filled with the next elements in the cycle. For example, if the pattern is [5,4,5,6,1,2], and there are zeros after 5, they become 4,5,6,1, etc.\n\nSo in the test input's first list, after 8,1,2,6,1,2, the zeros (four of them) need to be replaced by the next elements in the pattern. But what's the pattern here?\n\nLooking at the elements after the zeros: 1,2,5,1,2,9. Hmm, maybe the pattern is 8,1,2,6,1,2 followed by 1,2,5,1,2,9, but that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, perhaps the entire list is constructed by a cycle that alternates between different sequences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern for each list is the same as another list in the test input. For example, the first list in the test input starts with 8,1,2,6,1,2, which also appears later in the list. After the zeros, it continues with 1,2,5,1,2,9, etc. Maybe the pattern is a combination of these numbers.\n\nAlternatively, the approach is to look for a repeating subsequence. Let's check if the elements after the zeros match any previous part of the list.\n\nIn the first test list:\n\nAfter the zeros, we have 1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,8,1,2,6,1,2,2,1,2,3,1.\n\nLooking for a possible cycle here. The sequence 1,2,5,1,2,9 repeats? Or maybe 1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,8,1,2,6... which seems similar to the start of the list. The start was 8,1,2,6,1,2. Then after the zeros, it's 1,2,5,1,2,9, then later 8,1,2,6,1,2 again. Maybe the pattern is a longer cycle that includes these numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros in each list are to be replaced by the same numbers that appear in the same positions in another part of the list. For example, in the first list, the zeros are at positions 6-9. Looking elsewhere in the list, after position 10, there's 1,2,5,1,2,9. Maybe the pattern here is that after 8,1,2,6,1,2, the next elements are 1,2,5,1,2,9, then 8,1,2,6, etc., forming a larger cycle. So the zeros would be replaced by 1,2,5,1 (assuming the four zeros need to be filled with these numbers). Let's check:\n\nOriginal input sequence up to zeros: 8,1,2,6,1,2, [zeros], then 1,2,5,1,2,9... So inserting 1,2,5,1 into the zeros would make the sequence 8,1,2,6,1,2,1,2,5,1, followed by the existing 1,2,5,1,2,9. That might create a repetition. But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern before the zeros is 8,1,2,6,1,2, and after the zeros is 1,2,5,1,2,9. So the zeros are interrupting the transition between two parts of the pattern. Maybe the correct elements to replace the zeros are part of the original sequence that was replaced by zeros. For example, if the zeros are four in number, perhaps they should be filled with 5,1,2,9 to continue the pattern. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, looking for repeating subsequences in the test input lists. Let's take another test input list:\n\nThe second test input list is:\n\n[1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 9, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8]\n\nHere, there are zeros at positions 6-9 and 14-16. Let's see if there's a pattern. Before the first set of zeros: 1,8,2,1,5,9. After the zeros: 8,9,1,5. Then zeros again, then 9, etc. Maybe the pattern here is 1,8,2,1,5,9 followed by 8,9,1,5,9, etc. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros in the test input are in the same positions as in the training examples, and the pattern is similar. For example, in the training examples, zeros are replaced by the continuation of the repeating sequence.\n\nBut this requires figuring out the repeating sequence for each list in the test input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the outputs for the test input are the same as the inputs but with all zeros removed and the sequence adjusted to maintain the pattern. But in the training examples, the output lengths are the same as the input lengths. So it's not removing zeros but replacing them.\n\nAnother approach: Look for the outputs in the training examples. For example, in Example 0, the output lists are the same as the input lists but with zeros replaced by the correct numbers from a repeating cycle. So the pattern is that each list in the input has a repeating sequence, and the zeros are breaks in that sequence which need to be filled in.\n\nThus, for the test input lists, we need to identify the repeating pattern for each list and replace the zeros with the appropriate elements.\n\nLet's take the first test input list again:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nLooking for a repeating pattern. Let's see:\n\nThe elements after the zeros are 1,2,5,1,2,9. Then after that comes 1,2,8,1,2,6. Wait, perhaps the pattern is alternating between sequences starting with 8,1,2,6,1,2 and 1,2,5,1,2,9, and then 8,1,2,6, etc. But that's not a consistent cycle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire sequence is a longer pattern. For example:\n\n8,1,2,6,1,2,1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,8,1,2,6,1,2,2,1,2,3,1.\n\nBut this is not obviously repeating. Alternatively, the sequence might consist of multiple shorter patterns concatenated.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the non-zero parts, perhaps the zeros should be filled with the continuation of the sequence that was before the zeros. For example, before the zeros, it's 8,1,2,6,1,2. Then the zeros are four elements. If the pattern is 8,1,2,6,1,2 followed by 1,2,5,1, then the zeros would be replaced by 1,2,5,1. But after the zeros, the existing elements are 1,2,5,1, so that would mean inserting the same elements. That might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros are replaced by the elements that follow the same pattern as the surrounding elements. For example, if before the zeros it's 8,1,2,6,1,2, then after the zeros, it's 1,2,5,1,2,9. Maybe the zeros should be filled with elements that transition from the previous sequence to the next.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of another approach. In the training examples, the output is the same as the input but with zeros replaced by the correct elements based on a repeating pattern. So for the test input, each list's zeros must be replaced by elements that continue the pattern established in that list.\n\nFor example, in the third training example (Example 2), the input has zeros in certain positions, and the output fills them to continue the 1,2,1,4,1,6,1,8 pattern. So the zeros are filled with the next numbers in that sequence.\n\nApplying this to the test input, perhaps each list has its own underlying pattern. For example, the first test list might have a pattern that starts with 8,1,2,6,1,2 and then continues with 1,2,5,1,2,9, etc. But without knowing the exact pattern, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the test input lists are part of the same pattern as the training examples. For instance, looking at the first test input list: [8,1,2,6,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,8,1,2,6,1,2,2,1,2,3,1]. Maybe the zeros are replacing the sequence 1,2,5,1, which appears after the zeros. But then inserting those into the zeros would duplicate them. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that after 8,1,2,6,1,2 comes 1,2,5,1,2,9, so the zeros (four of them) should be filled with 1,2,5,1. Let's try that:\n\nOriginal input with zeros at positions 6-9: [8,1,2,6,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,2,5,1,2,9,...]. Replacing zeros with 1,2,5,1 would make the sequence:\n\n[8,1,2,6,1,2,1,2,5,1,1,2,5,1,2,9,...]. But then after the zeros, the next elements are 1,2,5,1,2,9. That would lead to duplicate 1,2,5,1. But maybe that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros are replaced by the next part of the cycle. For example, if the cycle is 8,1,2,6,1,2 followed by 1,2,5,1,2,9, then 8,1,2,6,1,2, then 1,2,5,1,2,9, etc. So inserting 1,2,5,1 into the four zeros would make the sequence:\n\n8,1,2,6,1,2,1,2,5,1,1,2,5,1,2,9...\n\nBut then after the inserted 1,2,5,1, the next elements are 1,2,5,1, which might be a repeat. This seems possible.\n\nBut how to verify this? Looking at the output of the training examples, the pattern repeats correctly after the zeros. So perhaps in the test input, the zeros are replaced by the continuation of the pattern that was established before the zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each list in the test input has a repeating pattern that includes the elements before and after the zeros. For example, in the first test list:\n\nBefore zeros: 8,1,2,6,1,2\n\nAfter zeros: 1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,8,1,2,6,1,2,2,1,2,3,1\n\nSo maybe the pattern is 8,1,2,6,1,2 followed by 1,2,5,1,2,9, then 1,2,8,1,2,6, etc. But this seems arbitrary. Alternatively, perhaps the pattern is that after 8,1,2,6,1,2 comes 1,2,5,1,2,9, and then 1,2,8,1,2,6, creating a longer cycle. But without more data, it's hard to be certain.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed under the assumption that each list in the test input has a repeating pattern, and the zeros are to be replaced by the continuation of the pattern that was present before the zeros.\n\nFor example, in the first test list, the zeros are at positions 6-9. The elements before the zeros are 8,1,2,6,1,2. If this is part of a repeating cycle, then after 6 elements, the next elements would repeat. So if the cycle is 6 elements (8,1,2,6,1,2), then the next elements would be 8,1,2,6,1,2 again. But the zeros are four elements, so replacing them with 8,1,2,6 would fit. However, after the zeros, the elements are 1,2,5,1, which doesn't match that. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is longer. For example, 8,1,2,6,1,2,1,2,5,1,2,9, which is 12 elements. Then the cycle repeats. But without clear repetition, this is speculative.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the position of the zeros in the test input and see if the numbers around them suggest a pattern. For example, in the first test list, after the zeros, there's 1,2,5,1,2,9, which might suggest that the zeros should be filled with 5,1,2,9. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the test input lists are designed such that the output is the same as the input but with all zeros replaced by the next number in the sequence. But how to determine the next number?\n\nGiven that all the training examples show that the output is the input with zeros replaced by the correct elements to maintain a repeating pattern, I think the correct approach is to replace the zeros with the elements that continue the repeating sequence for each list.\n\nBut to apply this, I need to determine the repeating pattern for each test list. Since time is limited, perhaps the best approach is to replace the zeros with the sequence that comes after them. For example, in the first test list, the zeros are followed by 1,2,5,1, so maybe the zeros are replaced by those numbers. But that would duplicate them. Alternatively, the zeros are replaced by the sequence that comes before them. For example, 8,1,2,6,1,2 is followed by zeros, so maybe the pattern repeats from the beginning, making the zeros replaced by 8,1,2,6. But after the zeros, the sequence is 1,2,5, which doesn't match.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Given that the training examples have outputs that are the same as the inputs but with zeros replaced to continue the pattern, and since the test input is structured similarly, the answer likely requires replacing each run of zeros with the elements that should be there based on the repeating pattern.\n\nIn the absence of a clear pattern, but based on the training examples, the answer is likely each test input list with the zeros replaced by the appropriate elements from their respective patterns. For the purpose of this exercise, I'll assume that the output for each test input list is the same as the input but with the zeros replaced to continue the pattern observed in the non-zero parts of the list.\n\nFor example, in the first test input list:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nAssuming the zeros are replaced by the next elements in the pattern, which after 8,1,2,6,1,2 would be 1,2,5,1 (since after the zeros it's 1,2,5,1), but this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that after 8,1,2,6,1,2 comes 1,2,5,1,2,9, and then 8,1,2,6, etc. So the four zeros would be replaced by 1,2,5,1.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of numbers, and the output seems to be modifying those inputs in some way. Let me start by comparing the input and output of each example to see what's changing.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input lists have some sequences with zeros, like [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 5, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 1]. The corresponding output list in Example 0's output doesn't have those zeros. For instance, the output is [5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, ...], so it looks like the zeros in the input are being replaced by the original numbers from the sequence. So maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a sequence of zeros in the input, they are replaced by the numbers that would come next in the original repeating sequence.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has some parts with zeros, like [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 5, 4, ...], and the output removes those leading zeros and shifts the sequence. Wait, no\u2014the output for that line in Example 1 is [3, 7, 1, 2, 5, 7, 5, 4, ...]. So maybe the zeros are being replaced by elements from a previous part of the sequence. Hmm. Or perhaps the zeros are being filled in by the correct continuation of the pattern. For example, the input might have a broken sequence, and the output fixes it by continuing the correct sequence without the zeros.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has sequences like [1, 6, 1, 8, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, ...], and the output replaces those zeros with the correct sequence. The original pattern in Example 2 seems to be alternating between 1 and even numbers (like 2,4,6,8) in a repeating fashion. So when the input has zeros, the output fills them with the correct continuation.\n\nSo the general pattern seems to be that the input lists have certain sections replaced with zeros, and the output restores those sections by continuing the original sequence from before the zeros. So the task is to identify the underlying repeating sequence in each list and replace the zeros with the appropriate numbers to continue that sequence.\n\nNow, looking at the test input. Let's take the first line of the test input:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nHere, there's a section of four zeros. Let's look at the sequence before the zeros: 8,1,2,6,1,2. Then after the zeros, it's 1,2,5,1,2,9... Hmm. Wait, maybe each list has its own repeating pattern. For example, maybe the original sequence before the zeros is 8,1,2,6,1,2, and the next part should continue that pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at other lines in the test input, maybe each line follows a certain cycle. For instance, in the first test line, after the zeros, there's 1,2,5... Maybe the sequence before the zeros was 8,1,2,6,1,2 and after the zeros, it's continuing as 1,2,5... but that doesn't immediately make sense. Alternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced by the next elements in the sequence that was established before the zeros.\n\nWait, let's think about how the training examples handled zeros. For instance, in Example 0, one of the input lines is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 5, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2], and the output line is [2,3,4,5,2,1,2,3,4,5,2,1,2,3,4,5,2,1,2,3,4,5,2,1,2,3,4,5,2]. So the zeros in the input are replaced by the correct elements. Let's check: the input starts with 2, then four zeros, then 1. The output starts with 2,3,4,5,2,1... So the zeros were replaced by 3,4,5,2. So the original sequence before the zeros was 2, then the zeros are filled with 3,4,5,2, and then 1 follows. So it's like the sequence is repeating a cycle, and when zeros appear, they're replaced by the next elements in the cycle.\n\nSo in the training examples, the pattern is that each input list has certain elements replaced by zeros, and the output is the list with those zeros replaced by the correct elements of the original sequence. The key is to figure out what the original sequence is for each list and fill in the zeros accordingly.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Each line in the test input has zeros that need to be replaced. Let's take the first test input line:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nThe part before the zeros is 8,1,2,6,1,2. Then after four zeros, it's 1,2,5, etc. Let's see if there's a repeating pattern here. Let's look at the elements after the zeros: 1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,8,1,2,6,1,2,2,1,2,3,1. Hmm. Maybe the sequence cycles through certain numbers. Let's check if there's a pattern before and after the zeros.\n\nLooking at the elements before the zeros: 8,1,2,6,1,2. Then after the zeros: 1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,8,1,2,6,... So maybe the sequence after the zeros continues the pattern. Let's see: 8,1,2,6,1,2 \u2014 maybe the next elements would be something like 3,4, etc., but in the output, after the zeros, it's 1,2,5. That might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the original sequence is 8,1,2,6,1,2 followed by 5,1,2,9, etc., and the zeros are replaced by those next elements. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each list has a certain cycle, and the zeros are interrupting that cycle. For example, if the cycle is 8,1,2,6,1,2, then after that, the next part would be 5,1,2,9, etc. So the four zeros would be replaced by 5,1,2,9. But looking at the input after zeros, the next elements are 1,2,5, which may not match. Wait, maybe the zeros are in the middle of the cycle, and the correct continuation is inserted. So in the input, the part before the zeros is 8,1,2,6,1,2. The zeros are four in number. The output would replace those zeros with the next four elements in the cycle, which might be 5,1,2,9. Then the part after the zeros in the input is 1,2,5... which would not match. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the original sequence is a repetition of a certain sub-sequence. Let's look for repeating patterns. For example, in the test input's first line, after the zeros, there's 1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,8,1,2,6, etc. So maybe each segment is something like [X,1,2,Y], where X and Y change. For example, 8,1,2,6, then 1,2,5,1, then 2,9,1,2, then 8,1,2,6 again. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are part of a larger structure, like each group starts with a higher number followed by 1,2, then another number. For example: 8,1,2,6; 1,2,5; 1,2,9; 8,1,2,6 again. It's possible that the zeros are in the middle of such a group and need to be filled with the missing numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each list in the test input is a corrupted version of a repeating sequence, and the zeros need to be replaced by the correct elements. The challenge is to figure out what the original sequence is for each list, then fill in the zeros accordingly.\n\nLet's take another approach. Looking at the test input lines, they seem to have similar structures. For example, the first line has 8,1,2,6,1,2 followed by zeros, then 1,2,5, etc. Another line is [1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 9, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8]. Here, there are zeros in multiple places. The output would need to replace those zeros with the correct sequence elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that whenever there are consecutive zeros, they are replaced by a specific subsequence. For example, in Example 0, some zeros are replaced by the continuation of the prior elements. So if the input has a block of zeros, we look at the elements before the zeros to determine the next elements in the sequence and replace the zeros with those.\n\nAnother observation: In the training examples, the output lists are the same as some of the input lists but with the zeros replaced. For example, in Example 0, the first input line is the same as the output line. That's because there are no zeros in the first input line. The other input lines have zeros, and the output lines replace them with the correct numbers.\n\nSo the key is to identify the underlying sequence for each list and replace any zeros with the correct numbers from the sequence.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's take the first line of the test input again:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nLooking at the elements before the zeros (positions 0-5): 8,1,2,6,1,2. Then there are four zeros (positions 6-9). After that, positions 10-13 are 1,2,5,1. Let's see if there's a pattern. The sequence before the zeros is 8,1,2,6,1,2. Let's see if after the zeros, the sequence continues as 1,2,5,1,2,9, etc. Maybe the pattern is that each \"block\" is something like X,1,2,Y, where X and Y are numbers. For example:\n\n8,1,2,6 \u2192 X=8, Y=6\nThen 1,2,5 \u2192 X=1, Y=5?\nBut then 1,2,9 \u2192 X=1, Y=9? That doesn't fit a clear numerical progression. Alternatively, maybe the sequence is built by alternating higher numbers with 1,2 pairs. For example:\n\n8,1,2,6 \u2192 followed by 1,2,5 \u2192 then 1,2,9 \u2192 then 8,1,2,6 again. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the numbers after 1,2 are incrementing by 4 each time: 6, then 5 (no, that's a decrease), then 9 (increase). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros in the first line should be replaced with 5,1,2,9. Let's see: the input's zeros are at positions 6-9. If the original sequence before the zeros is 8,1,2,6,1,2, then perhaps the next elements are 5,1,2,9. Replacing the four zeros with those would make the sequence continue as 8,1,2,6,1,2,5,1,2,9, then 1,2, etc. But in the input after the zeros, the next elements are 1,2,5. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that after 8,1,2,6,1,2 comes 5,1,2,9, then 1,2,8, etc. So replacing the four zeros with 5,1,2,9 would make the sequence continue correctly. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input part before zeros: 8,1,2,6,1,2\nReplace zeros with 5,1,2,9 \u2192 so after that, the next elements are 1,2,5, which matches the input's 1,2,5. Wait, but then after inserting 5,1,2,9, the next elements would be 1,2,5, which is part of the inserted sequence. But the input's next elements after zeros are 1,2,5. So inserting 5,1,2,9 would mean that after the zeros, we have 5,1,2,9 followed by 1,2,5. That doesn't make sense. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the zeros are replacing a part of the sequence, and the correct sequence is a repetition of a certain cycle. Let's look for repeating patterns in the test input. For example, the first line has 8,1,2,6,1,2 followed by zeros. Then after the zeros, there's 1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,8,1,2,6, etc. So perhaps the sequence is 8,1,2,6,1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,8, etc. But then the zeros are replacing 5,1,2,9. Let's check if that's the case.\n\nIf the input's zeros are at positions 6-9, replacing them with 5,1,2,9 would make the sequence:\n\n8,1,2,6,1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,5,1,2,9, etc. But then the part after the inserted elements (positions 10-13) in the input are 1,2,5,1. So that would fit if after inserting 5,1,2,9, the next elements are 1,2,5, which is the case here. But why would the inserted elements be 5,1,2,9? Because the original sequence is 8,1,2,6, then 1,2,5, then 1,2,9, then 1,2,8, etc. So each block is X,1,2,Y where X and Y are numbers. For example:\n\n8,1,2,6 \u2192 then 1,2,5 \u2192 then 1,2,9 \u2192 then 8,1,2,6 again? But that seems arbitrary. Maybe the pattern isn't clear, but the key is that the zeros need to be filled with the correct continuation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequences in the test input are similar to the training examples. For example, the training examples had sequences that repeated every certain number of elements. Let's see in Example 0, the first line of input and output is [5,4,5,6,1,2,5,4,5,6,1,2,...], which repeats every 6 elements: 5,4,5,6,1,2. So the zeros in other lines of input in Example 0 are replaced with the continuation of this 6-element cycle.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the first input line is [5,4,2,1,2,2,5,3,2,7,1,2,3,6,2,6,2,1,2,5,2,5,5,7,1,2,2,4,3], and the output's first line is the same. The second input line starts with four zeros followed by 5,7,5,4, etc., and the output replaces those zeros with 3,7,1,2, etc. So it's a different cycle.\n\nTherefore, each list in the input has its own repeating cycle, and the zeros are parts of the cycle that need to be filled in. The challenge is to determine the cycle for each list and replace the zeros accordingly.\n\nIn the test input, each line may have its own cycle. Let's take the first line:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nWe need to find the cycle here. Let's look for a repeating pattern. The elements after the zeros are 1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,8,1,2,6,1,2,2,1,2,3,1. Hmm. Let's see if there's a pattern of numbers increasing by 4 or something. For example, 8, 6, 5, 9, 8, 6, 2, 3... Not obvious. Alternatively, maybe the cycle is 8,1,2,6,1,2 followed by 5,1,2,9, then 8,1,2,6 again. So the zeros are replacing the 5,1,2,9 part. If that's the case, then the four zeros would be replaced by 5,1,2,9. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input before zeros: 8,1,2,6,1,2. Then zeros. After replacement, it would be 8,1,2,6,1,2,5,1,2,9. Then the next elements are 1,2,5, which would fit if the cycle continues with 1,2,5. But wait, that doesn't form a repeating cycle. Maybe the cycle length is longer. Alternatively, maybe the cycle is 8,1,2,6,1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,8, etc., but that's not a fixed cycle length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each line in the test input is part of a larger structure where the numbers are grouped into sequences that repeat. For instance, looking at other lines in the test input, such as:\n\n[5, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 5, 8]\n\nHere, there are zeros in two places. The part before the first set of zeros is 5,3,1,8,2,1. Then after four zeros, it's 8,1,8,9. Then three zeros, then 1. If the cycle here is 5,3,1,8,2,1,8,1,8,9, etc., but it's unclear.\n\nThis is getting a bit tricky. Another approach: look at the positions of the zeros and see if the surrounding numbers can help determine the correct sequence.\n\nTaking the first test line again: the zeros start at position 6. The elements before are 8,1,2,6,1,2. The elements after are 1,2,5,1,2,9, etc. Let's see if the sequence after the zeros is a continuation. If after 8,1,2,6,1,2, the next elements would be 5,1,2,9, then 1,2,8, etc. So replacing the four zeros with 5,1,2,9 would make the sequence flow as 8,1,2,6,1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,5,1,2,9... but that doesn't seem to match the following elements which are 1,2,5,1,2,9. So inserting 5,1,2,9 would fit. So maybe the four zeros are replaced by 5,1,2,9.\n\nSimilarly, in another part of the same line, after inserting those, the next part would be 1,2,5, etc., which is part of the sequence.\n\nAnother example: the fourth line of the test input is [5,1,2,9,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,2,2,1,0,0,0,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,8,1,2,6,1]. Here, there are four zeros at positions 6-9. Before them: 5,1,2,9,1,2. After: 1,2,2,1, then three zeros. So perhaps the four zeros should be replaced with 8,1,2,6, following the pattern seen earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each list in the test input follows a certain pattern where the zeros are replaced by elements from a previous part of the sequence. For example, in the training examples, the zeros were replaced by the continuation of the sequence. So for the test input, we need to find for each list the correct continuation of the sequence before the zeros, then replace the zeros with those elements.\n\nThis requires analyzing each list individually to find their underlying pattern. Let's try with the first test line again:\n\nOriginal sequence up to zeros: 8,1,2,6,1,2.\n\nWhat's next? Let's look at the elements after the zeros. After the four zeros, the sequence continues with 1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,8,1,2,6, etc. So after 8,1,2,6,1,2 comes 1,2,5,1,2,9, etc. But that seems inconsistent. Maybe the pattern is that after 8,1,2,6 comes 1,2,5, then 1,2,9, then 1,2,8, creating a loop. So the zeros would be replaced by 1,2,5,1. But that's four elements. But the zeros are four in number, so replacing them with 1,2,5,1 would fit. Then the sequence after would start with 2,9, etc. But in the input after the zeros, we have 1,2,5,1,2,9. So inserting 1,2,5,1 into the zeros would make the sequence 8,1,2,6,1,2,1,2,5,1, followed by 1,2,5,1,2,9. That doesn't make sense because there's a repetition of 1,2,5,1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that after 8,1,2,6,1,2 comes 5,1,2,9, then 8,1,2,6 again. So the four zeros are replaced by 5,1,2,9, which would make the sequence: 8,1,2,6,1,2,5,1,2,9, then 1,2,5... Wait, but after inserting 5,1,2,9, the next elements are 1,2,5. That suggests that after 9 comes 1,2,5, which would be part of the next cycle. So maybe the pattern is 8,1,2,6,1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,5,... but I'm not sure. It's getting a bit unclear.\n\nAnother approach: look for repeating triplets. For example, in the first line after the zeros: 1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,8,1,2,6, etc. Each triplet is 1,2,X where X increases: 5,9,8,6. Maybe this X is decreasing? 5,9,8,6\u2014doesn't make a clear pattern. Or perhaps it's following a different order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the X values are 6,5,9,8,6, etc., which doesn't form a clear numerical pattern. But perhaps the sequence is designed to repeat certain key numbers. For example, 8,6,5,9,8,6, etc. Not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to assume that each block of zeros should be replaced by the continuation of the sequence that was present before the zeros. For example, in the first line, the sequence before zeros is 8,1,2,6,1,2. So what comes next? If the pattern is 8,1,2,6,1,2 repeating, then after 6,1,2 comes 8 again. But that's not what's after the zeros. Alternatively, maybe the sequence after the zeros is part of the same cycle. But it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the entire test input, maybe the zeros are replaced with the elements from the first part of the sequence. For example, in the first line, after the zeros, the sequence continues with 1,2,5, etc., which might be part of a different segment. However, without a clear pattern, this is challenging.\n\nAnother observation: in the training examples, the output lists often repeat a certain pattern without any zeros. For example, in Example 0, the output lists are the same as the first input list but with the zeros replaced by the correct numbers. So maybe the test input's output should similarly be the lists with all zeros replaced by the correct numbers, following the pattern established in each list.\n\nBut how to find that pattern for each list? Let's take the first test line again. Let's look at the non-zero parts. The line starts with 8,1,2,6,1,2, then four zeros, then 1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,8,1,2,6,1,2,2,1,2,3,1. So perhaps the correct sequence is 8,1,2,6,1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,8,1,2,6,1,2,2,1,2,3,1. But where do the 5,1,2,9 come from? It's possible that the zeros are replacing those elements, and the output would just include them. Wait, but in the input, after the zeros, there's 1,2,5, which suggests that the zeros are replaced by 5,1,2,9, but that's four elements, and the zeros are four in number. Then the next part after the zeros starts with 1,2,5, which would fit if the zeros were replaced by 5,1,2,9. But then the next elements after that would be 1,2,9, which is part of the sequence. So maybe inserting 5,1,2,9 into the zeros would make the sequence correct.\n\nSo for the first test line, the output would be:\n\n[8,1,2,6,1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,8,1,2,6,1,2,2,1,2,3,1]\n\nBut wait, the input after the zeros is 1,2,5, which would now be after inserting 5,1,2,9. So the sequence would be 8,1,2,6,1,2,5,1,2,9, followed by 1,2,5, etc. That creates a duplication of 5,1,2,9 and 1,2,5, which doesn't make sense. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are in the middle of a sequence that should continue. For example, the sequence is 8,1,2,6,1,2, followed by 5,1,2,9, then 1,2,8, etc. So replacing the four zeros with 5,1,2,9 would make the sequence correct.\n\nBut then the input's part after the zeros is 1,2,5, which would come after 9. So the full sequence would be 8,1,2,6,1,2,5,1,2,9,1,2,5,1,2,9, etc. That seems possible. But why does 5 appear again? Maybe the cycle is longer than we thought.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to assume that each block of zeros is replaced by the next elements in the sequence that was established before the zeros. For example, if a sequence starts with A, B, C, and then has zeros, replace them with D, E, F, etc., continuing the pattern.\n\nIn the first test line, the sequence before zeros is 8,1,2,6,1,2. The next elements after that in the input are 1,2,5. So perhaps the correct continuation after 8,1,2,6,1,2 is 5,1,2,9, replacing the four zeros. Then the input's 1,2,5 would be part of the next cycle.\n\nBut this is speculative. Given the time, I'll proceed with this approach and generate the output by replacing each block of zeros with the next elements in the sequence that was present before the zeros. For example, in the first line, replace the four zeros with 5,1,2,9. Then the output becomes:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nBut this is a guess. Let's check if this pattern holds for other lines. For example, the second line of the test input:\n\n[1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 9, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8]\n\nHere, there are two blocks of zeros. The first block is four zeros after 1,8,2,1,5,9. Then after the zeros, it's 8,9,1,5, etc. Maybe the four zeros are replaced by 8,9,1,5. Then the next block of three zeros after 1,5 would be replaced by 9,1,8. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is 1,8,2,1,5,9 followed by 8,9,1,5, etc., so replacing the zeros with those. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the need to generate an answer, I'll proceed to generate the output by replacing each block of zeros with the sequence that continues the pattern from before the zeros. For example, in the first line, after 8,1,2,6,1,2 comes 5,1,2,9. Then the output line would have those numbers instead of zeros. Similarly, other zeros in other lines would be replaced by their respective continuations.",
