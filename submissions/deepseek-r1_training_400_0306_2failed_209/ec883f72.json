        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a grid of numbers, and the output modifies certain cells. Let's start with Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the bottom two rows are all zeros. The output adds a 3 and another 3 diagonally in those rows. Like, in the fifth row, there's a 3 in the fifth position, and the sixth row has a 3 in the sixth position. Maybe they're placed in the corners of some structure?\n\nExample 1's input has a lot of 8s and 6. The output adds 6s in positions that look like they're forming a diagonal. The fourth row has a 6 in the second column and sixth in the last column. The fifth row starts with a 6. Hmm, maybe the numbers are being placed in a diagonal pattern starting from certain points in the original grid.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a structure of 4s and 2s. The output adds 2s in the upper rows, again diagonally. The fourth row ends with a 2, then the fifth row starts with 2 and ends with 2. It seems like the numbers are being added in a diagonal fashion, possibly starting from the bottom of existing structures.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 5s and 4s. The output adds 4s in a diagonal line going up from the fifth row. The first few rows now have 4s placed diagonally from the bottom left upwards. So maybe the pattern is that for each \"block\" of a certain number, we add new numbers in a diagonal direction above them?\n\nPutting this together, the pattern might be that for each contiguous block of numbers in the input, a certain number (maybe the same as the block's number or related) is added diagonally above the block. The new numbers are placed in a diagonal line, either starting from the corners or along the edges of the original block.\n\nLooking at the test input. The input has a structure with 3s and 4s. Let's see where the blocks are. The first four rows have columns with 3s and 4s. The fifth row has a row of 3s. Then lots of zeros below. \n\nIn the test input, the 3s are in columns 4 (index 4) and 9 (index 9) of the first four rows. Then, the fifth row is a horizontal line of 3s. The 4s are in columns 6 and 7 (indices 6 and 7) of the first three rows. \n\nFollowing the pattern from the examples, maybe we need to add 3s and 4s in a diagonal direction above their respective blocks. For the 4s, since they form a vertical block in the first few rows (columns 6 and 7), maybe the diagonal would go upwards and to the right? Or maybe the 3s, which are in a horizontal line in the fifth row, would have diagonals going upwards.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 9s form a cross shape. The output added 3s in the lower rows. Hmm. Maybe the new numbers are placed at a distance from the original blocks. For example, the 3s are added two rows below the original 9 block. But in Example 1, the 6s are added a few rows above the 8 structure. Wait, in Example 1, the 8s are in the upper part, and the 6s are added below. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 8s are in rows 0,1,2, and columns 2 and 6. The 6 is at (0,4). The output adds 6s in row 3, column 1 and 7, and row 4, column 0. It seems like the 6s are forming a diagonal line moving down and left. So maybe the added numbers are moving in a diagonal direction starting from the original number's position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the \"depth\" of zeros around the blocks. For example, in Example 0, the 3s are added at the bottom, possibly where there's a gap. Or perhaps the pattern is that each number is \"mirrored\" in some diagonal direction outside of its original block.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the added numbers are placed in the first available positions along a diagonal path starting from the original block's edge. For example, in Example 0, the 3s are added in the lower rows, perhaps one step down and right from the bottom of the 9s. Wait, the 9s are in the fourth row. The added 3s are in row 4 and 5. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for the numbers added in the output and see their relation to the input. For example, in Example 0, the output adds 3s. The input has 3s in the first two rows. So maybe the 3s in the output are related to the existing 3s. But they are added in a diagonal way. The existing 3s are in the first two rows, columns 0 and 1. The new 3s are in row 4, column 4 and row 5, column 5. That's a diagonal from (4,4) to (5,5). But how is that connected to the original 3s? Maybe the 3s are being extended diagonally from the end of their original block. The original 3s stop at row 1. Then, new 3s are added further down, but spaced out. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the added numbers are placed in a way that forms a diamond or some geometric shape. For example, in Example 3, the added 4s form a diagonal line from the bottom left upwards. The original 4s are in columns 0-3 of rows 7-11. The added 4s are in rows 0-5, columns 6-10 (but spaced diagonally). Wait, in the output of Example 3, the first few rows have 4s placed in a diagonal pattern moving up from the fifth row. For instance, row 5 (index 5) has a 5 in column 5. Then the 4s start at row 5, column 6 (no, the fifth row in Example 3's output is the 5s and the sixth row starts with 5). Hmm, perhaps the added 4s are placed in the upper part, starting from the right side of the 5s' block and moving up diagonally to the left. Wait, the 5s in Example 3's input are in the fifth row (index 5), columns 0-5. The output adds 4s starting from row 0, column 10, then row 1 column 9, etc. So each 4 is moving left and up. The 4s are being placed in a diagonal line that's moving upwards and to the left, starting from the end of the 5s' row. That might be the pattern.\n\nSo, perhaps the pattern is: for each horizontal line of numbers (like the 5s in Example 3), we add a diagonal line of another number (4 in this case) starting from the end of that horizontal line and moving upwards and to the left. Similarly, in Example 1, the 6s form a diagonal line that starts from the existing 6 (in row 0, column 4) and moves down and to the left. So, the 6 in row 0, column 4 leads to a diagonal of 6s in row 3 column 1, row 4 column 0, etc. That seems like a diagonal moving down-left from the original 6.\n\nIn Example 2, the original 2s are in rows 7 and 8, columns 3-4. The output adds 2s in rows 3 and 4, columns 8 and 8, and row 4 column 0. Wait, maybe not. Let me check again. In the output of Example 2, row 3 has a 2 in column 8, row 4 has 2 in column 0 and 8. It's possible that these 2s are placed diagonally upwards from the existing 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the added numbers might be forming a diamond shape around the original blocks. For example, in Example 0, the 3s are added two rows below the original 3s, but forming a diagonal. Maybe the distance between the original block and the new numbers increases as you go down the examples.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let's try to find a common rule.\n\nLooking at all examples:\n\n- Each output adds new numbers (same or different) in a diagonal pattern.\n- The positions of the added numbers seem to be determined by the original blocks' positions.\n- The added numbers are placed in a diagonal line that starts at the edge of the original block and extends outward.\n\nFor instance, in Example 0, the original 3s are in the top-left. The added 3s are diagonally placed in the lower rows. In Example 1, the original 6 is in row 0, column 4. The added 6s are in a diagonal line moving down-left from there. In Example 3, the original 4s are in the lower-left. The added 4s are in a diagonal line moving up-right starting from the end of the 5s' row.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: For each horizontal block of numbers, add a diagonal line of the same number (or a related number) starting from the end of the block and moving in a specific direction (like up-left, down-left, etc.). The direction and the number used may depend on the original block's number.\n\nBut how to determine the direction and the number to use?\n\nIn Example 0, the original 3s are in the first two rows. The added 3s are in a diagonal line starting from the fifth row. Maybe the direction is down-right. Wait, the added 3s are in positions (4,4) and (5,5), which is a diagonal. The original 3s are in rows 0-1, columns 0-1. The added 3s are two rows below and shifted right. That might be a diagonal step of +4 rows and +4 columns. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new numbers are placed at the first available position along a diagonal path that starts from the original block's bottom-right corner. For example, in Example 0, the original 3s are in rows 0-1, columns 0-1. The bottom-right is (1,1). The next possible positions down and right would be (2,2), but that's zero. But in the output, the added 3s are at (4,4) and (5,5). So maybe after skipping some rows, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new numbers are placed in the first available positions along a diagonal path that starts from the original block's edge and moves outward. For example, in Example 1, the original 6 is at (0,4). The next positions in a down-left direction (row+1, column-1) would be (1,3), which is zero. Then (2,2) which is 8. So maybe not. But in the output, the 6s are added at (3,1) and (4,0). So the diagonal from (0,4) to (3,1) and (4,0) is a direction of down and left, but steps of 3 rows and 3 columns difference. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of steps is determined by the value of the original number. For example, 6 in Example 1: 6 divided by 2 is 3 steps? So starting from (0,4), moving down 3 and left 3 would land at (3,1). Then another step down 1 and left 1 to (4,0). But that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the distance could be the same as the number's value. For example, 6: moving 6 steps in some direction? But in Example 1, the 6 is placed 3 rows down and 3 columns left from the original 6. 3 is half of 6. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think differently. Maybe each number in the input has a corresponding \"mirror\" in the output, placed diagonally at a certain distance. The direction and distance could be determined by the number's value. For example, 3s are mirrored at a distance of 2 rows and columns down-right. 6s are mirrored 3 rows down and left.\n\nBut how to verify this with the examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the original 3s are at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). The added 3s are at (4,4) and (5,5). The distance is 4 rows down and 4 columns right. So 3 is the original number, and 4 steps away. Not sure.\n\nIn Example 1, the original 6 is at (0,4). The added 6s are at (3,1) and (4,0). The distance is 3 rows down and 3 columns left. So 6 divided by 2 is 3. Maybe the step is value divided by 2. But 3 is not divisible by 2. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: look for the new numbers and see if they match any existing numbers in the input. For example, in Example 0, the added numbers are 3s, which are present in the original input. In Example 1, the added numbers are 6s, which are present in the original input. Example 2 adds 2s, which are present. Example 3 adds 4s, which are present. So, the added numbers are the same as some existing numbers in the input.\n\nSo the rule might be: For each occurrence of a number in the input, place another instance of that number in a diagonal position relative to it. But how to determine where.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being placed in such a way that they form a diamond or another shape. For example, in Example 0, the original 9s form a cross. The added 3s are two rows below the 9s. But the 3s in the output are not near the 9s. So perhaps the 3s are added based on their own original positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the added numbers are placed in the first available diagonal positions starting from the bottom of the grid, moving upwards. For example, in Example 0, the added 3s are at the bottom of the grid. In Example 1, the added 6s are in the middle rows. Maybe the direction varies.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's look at the test input. The test input has 3s and 4s. Let's see:\n\nRows 0-3 have 3s in column 4 and 9. Then, row 4 has a full line of 3s from column 4 to 9. The 4s are in columns 6 and 7 of rows 0-2.\n\nFollowing the pattern from the examples, perhaps the 3s need to be placed in a diagonal direction from their original positions. For example, the horizontal line of 3s in row 4 could have a diagonal line added downwards. Wait, but in the training examples, when there's a horizontal line, like the 5s in Example 3's input (row 5), the added numbers go upwards and to the left. So maybe the test input's row 4 of 3s would have added 3s moving up-left diagonally. But in the output examples, the direction varies. For example, in Example 1, the added 6s go down-left. In Example 3, the added 4s go up-left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each horizontal line of a number, we add a diagonal line of the same number moving up and to the left. For the vertical blocks, like the 4s in Example 3's input (columns 6 and 7 in rows 0-2), maybe they add a diagonal line moving up-right or something.\n\nIn the test input's case, the 3s in row 4 form a horizontal line. If we follow Example 3's pattern, the added 3s would form a diagonal line moving up-left. So starting from the end of the horizontal line (column 9 in row 4), we would add 3s in row 3 column 8, row 2 column 7, etc. But the test input's output needs to show where these would be placed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for horizontal lines, the diagonal is added upwards and to the right. Let's see. In Example 3, the 5s are in row 5, columns 0-5. The added 4s start from row 5, column 6 (but the output's first added 4 is in row 0, column 10). Wait, in Example 3's output, the added 4s start from the fifth row (the same as the 5s' row) and go upwards diagonally to the right. Wait, the added 4s are in rows 0-5, columns 6-10, moving up and right. So row 5 has a 4 at column 6? No, looking back:\n\nExample 3's output:\n\nRow 0: ...4,0\n\nRow 1: ...4,0,0\n\nRow 2: ...4,0,0,0\n\nRow 3: ...0,4,0,...\n\nRow 4: 0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0...\n\nRow 5: 5s and then zeros.\n\nSo the added 4s start from row 5, column 6 and go up diagonally to the left? Wait, no. Looking at the positions:\n\nRow 0: [..., 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nRow 1: [..., 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nRow 2: [..., 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 3: [..., 0, 4, 0, ...]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0...]\n\nRow 5: [5s...]\n\nWait, maybe the added 4s form a diagonal from (4,6) up to (0,10). Because row 4 has a 4 at column 6, row 3 has a 4 at column 7, row 2 at column 8, row 1 at 9, row 0 at 10. No, because in row 4, column 6 is 4. Then row 3, column 7 is 4. Row 2 column 8, etc. That would form a diagonal going up and right. So starting from row 4, column 6, each step up and to the right. So perhaps in the test input, the 4s are in columns 6 and 7, rows 0-2. Maybe a diagonal is added starting from the top of that block. For example, from row 0, column 7, add 4s in a diagonal going up-right. But in the test input's case, the 4s are in rows 0-2, columns 6-7. The added 4s could start from the top-right of that block (row 0, column 7) and go up-right. So row -1 would be out of bounds, but maybe they go down instead. Alternatively, maybe the direction is down-right. For example, in the test input, the 4s are in rows 0-2, columns 6-7. Adding 4s diagonally down-right would place them in rows 3,4,5... and columns 8,9... But the test input has zeros in those areas.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for vertical blocks (like the 4s in the test input's columns 6-7, rows 0-2), the added numbers are placed in a diagonal line starting from the bottom of the block and moving down-right. So from row 2, column 7, add 4s at (3,8), (4,9), etc. But the test input's rows 3-11 are mostly zeros. So adding 4s there might be possible.\n\nBut the test input's output needs to have these changes. Let's imagine:\n\nThe original 4s are in rows 0-2, columns 6-7. The added 4s would start from the bottom of that block, which is row 2, column 7, and proceed diagonally down-right. So row 3 column 8, row 4 column 9, row 5 column 10, etc. Let's see how many rows are there. The test input has 12 rows (0-11). So adding 4s in row 3 column 8, row 4 column 9, row 5 column 10, row 6 column 11. But the output may not go beyond the grid. So in row 3 column 8 (which is index 8), and so on.\n\nSimilarly, the horizontal line of 3s in row 4 columns 4-9. Following the pattern from Example 3, where the 5s' diagonal went up-right, perhaps the 3s here would add a diagonal line starting from the end of the horizontal line. The horizontal line ends at column 9. So starting from row 4 column 9, moving up-right would be row 3 column 10, row 2 column 11, but since there are only 12 columns (indices 0-11), column 11 is the last. But maybe it's up-left instead. If the direction is up-left, starting from row 4 column 9, then row 3 column 8, row 2 column 7, etc. But the existing 3s are in row 4 columns 4-9. If the diagonal is up-left, then row 3 column 8 would be part of that. But in the test input's row 3, column 8 is zero, so that's possible.\n\nBut how to decide which direction to go? In Example 3, the 5s' diagonal went up-right, but the added numbers were 4s, not 5s. So maybe the direction and the number depend on the original number. Alternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the number's parity or some other property.\n\nAlternatively, the number added is the same as the original, and the direction is determined by the number's value modulo something. For example, even numbers go one direction, odd another. But 3 is odd, 4 is even. \n\nAlternatively, the direction is based on the number itself. For example, 3 could be down-right, 4 up-left. But how to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, for each block of numbers, the added numbers are placed in a diagonal line that starts from the farthest end of the block and moves outward. For example, in the test input's 3s in row 4, columns 4-9. The farthest end is column 9. So start there and move diagonally up-right. But the grid has 12 columns, so row 4 column 9: up-right would be row 3 column 10, row 2 column 11. But those positions are zeros. So adding 3s there.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4s in columns 6-7, rows 0-2. The farthest end is row 2, column 7. So moving down-right from there: row 3 column 8, row 4 column 9, etc.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nFor the horizontal line of 3s in row 4 columns 4-9, add a diagonal line of 3s starting from (4,9) and moving up-right. So:\n\nRow 4, column 9 (original)\nRow 3, column 10\nRow 2, column 11\nRow 1, column 12 (which is out of bounds, so stop).\n\nBut since the grid has 12 columns (indices 0-11), column 10 and 11 are valid. So in row 3, column 10 would be added a 3. Row 2, column 11 added a 3.\n\nFor the vertical block of 4s in columns 6-7, rows 0-2. The farthest end is row 2, column 7. Add a diagonal line down-right:\n\nRow 3, column 8\nRow 4, column 9\nRow 5, column 10\nRow 6, column 11\nRow 7, column 12 (invalid)\nSo up to row 6, column 11.\n\nAdditionally, the test input's first four rows have 3s in column 4 and 9. For example, row 0 has 3 at column 4 and 9. Maybe these individual 3s also generate diagonal additions. But in the examples, when there's a single number (like the 6 in Example 1), the added numbers form a diagonal from it. So for each 3 in the first four rows (columns 4 and 9), perhaps adding a diagonal line.\n\nFor instance, in row 0 column 4 (3), perhaps adding a diagonal down-left. So row 1 column 3, row 2 column 2, row 3 column 1, row 4 column 0. But the existing values in those positions are zeros. So adding 3s there.\n\nSimilarly, the 3 in row 0 column 9. A diagonal down-left from there would be row 1 column 8, row 2 column 7, etc. But row 2 column 7 is part of the 4s block, so maybe those positions are skipped.\n\nBut the examples show that existing numbers are replaced only if they are zero. Or maybe the added numbers are placed in the first available zeros along the diagonal path.\n\nPutting this all together, the test input's output would have:\n\n- For the horizontal 3s in row 4: added 3s at (3,10), (2,11)\n- For the vertical 4s: added 4s at (3,8), (4,9), (5,10), (6,11)\n- For the individual 3s in columns 4 and 9 of rows 0-3: added 3s along their respective diagonals.\n\nWait, but looking at the training examples, the added numbers are only for certain blocks, not every single occurrence. For example, in Example 0, the original 3s are in the first two rows, but the added 3s are in the fifth and sixth rows. So maybe only certain blocks trigger the addition.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern might be to add a diagonal line for each \"edge\" of a contiguous block. For example, if a block has a horizontal edge, add a diagonal line from its end. If it has a vertical edge, add a diagonal line from its bottom.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to try to apply the pattern observed in the examples to the test input.\n\nBased on the training examples, here's a possible approach:\n\nFor each contiguous block of numbers in the input, identify the \"end\" points (like the end of a horizontal line or the bottom of a vertical line). Then, add a diagonal line of the same number starting from that end point and moving in a specific direction (like down-left for even numbers, up-right for odd, or something else).\n\nAlternatively, the direction might be determined by the number's value modulo something. For example, 3 (mod 4) is 3, which could be a certain direction.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, perhaps the best is to look for the most plausible application based on the examples.\n\nIn the test input, the most significant blocks are:\n\n- The vertical line of 3s in the first four rows (columns 4 and 9) \u2013 but wait, looking at the test input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,3,0,4,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: same.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nSo the 3s are in columns 4 and 9 for rows 0-3. So each row has two 3s. Then row 4 has a horizontal line of 3s from column 4 to 9.\n\nThe 4s are in columns 6 and 7 of rows 0-2.\n\nSo for the horizontal line of 3s in row 4, perhaps we need to add a diagonal line of 3s moving up and to the left. For example, starting from column 9, row 4, moving up-left:\n\nRow 4, column 9 \u2192 row 3, column 8 \u2192 row 2, column 7 \u2192 row 1, column 6 \u2192 row 0, column 5.\n\nBut in row 4, column 9 is a 3. The next position up-left is row 3, column 8. Which is zero. So adding a 3 there. Then row 2, column 7 (which is part of the 4s block, so maybe no). Or perhaps the added numbers are placed even if the positions are non-zero. But in the training examples, the added numbers seem to be placed in zeros.\n\nIn Example 1, the added 6s are placed in zeros. So perhaps the same applies here.\n\nSo for the horizontal line of 3s in row 4:\n\n- Starting from row 4, column 9 (3), move up-left to row 3 column 8 (0) \u2192 add 3.\n- Then row 2 column 7 (4 in test input, so can't add 3 here. Stop.\nSo only one added 3 at (3,8).\n\nAlternatively, if moving up-right:\n\nRow 4, column 9 \u2192 row 3, column 10 \u2192 row 2, column 11.\n\nThose positions are zeros, so add 3s there.\n\nSo added 3s at (3,10) and (2,11).\n\nFor the vertical 4s in columns 6-7, rows 0-2:\n\nThe bottom of this block is row 2, columns 6-7. So perhaps add a diagonal line down-right. For example, row 3, column 8 \u2192 row 4, column 9 \u2192 row 5, column 10 \u2192 row 6, column 11. All zeros, so add 4s there.\n\nSo in row 3, column 8 (0) \u2192 4.\nRow 4, column 9 (3) \u2192 can't replace, so maybe skip.\nWait, no, in the test input, row 4, column 9 is 3, so can't add 4 there. So the diagonal would start from row 2, column 7 \u2192 row 3, column 8 (4 added), row 4 column 9 (3, so stop). So only one 4 added at (3,8).\n\nAlternatively, if the direction is down-right from row 2, column 6 (left end of the 4s block):\n\nRow 3, column 7 \u2192 which is 0? But the original 4s are in columns 6-7. Row 3, column 7 is 0. Adding 4 there.\n\nThen row 4, column 8 (0) \u2192 4. Row 5, column 9 (3) \u2192 stop.\n\nHmm, but this doesn't align with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical block adds a diagonal line of 4s moving down-right from their bottom-right corner (row 2, column 7). So:\n\nRow 3, column 8 \u2192 4\nRow 4, column 9 \u2192 3 (existing, so stop)\nSo only one 4 added.\n\nBut in Example 3, the 4s are added in a long diagonal. So perhaps multiple steps are allowed.\n\nBut in the test input, row 3, column 8 is zero. So adding a 4 there. Then row 4 column 9 is 3, which is a different number, so no. Row 5 column 10 is zero. But since the vertical 4s are in columns 6-7, maybe the diagonal is moving to the right each step. So from row 2, column 7 \u2192 row 3, column 8 \u2192 row 4, column 9 \u2192 row 5, column 10 \u2192 row 6, column 11. So adding 4s in those positions where possible.\n\nBut row 4 column 9 is a 3, so it's skipped. So added 4s at (3,8), (5,10), (6,11).\n\nNow, looking at the other 3s in rows 0-3, columns 4 and 9. For example, row 0, column 4 and 9. Maybe each of these 3s adds a diagonal line.\n\nFor row 0, column 4 (3):\n\n- If the direction is down-left, then row 1 column 3 \u2192 row 2 column 2 \u2192 row 3 column 1 \u2192 row 4 column 0.\n\nThese positions are zeros, so add 3s there.\n\nSimilarly, row 0, column 9 (3):\n\n- Down-left: row 1 column 8 \u2192 row 2 column 7 \u2192 which is part of the 4s block. So add 3 at row 1 column 8, row 2 column 7 (existing 4, so stop). So only row 1, column 8 added.\n\nFor row 1's 3s in column 4 and 9:\n\n- row 1, column 4: down-left \u2192 row 2 column 3 \u2192 row 3 column 2 \u2192 row 4 column 1 \u2192 etc.\n- row 1, column 9: down-left \u2192 row 2 column 8 \u2192 row 3 column 7 \u2192 row 4 column 6 \u2192 etc.\n\nBut row 3 column 7 is zero. So add 3s there.\n\nThis could get very complicated, but the examples show that the additions are not overlapping and are placed in a diagonal pattern. However, in the training examples, the additions are minimal. So maybe only certain blocks trigger additions. For instance, the horizontal line of 3s in row 4, and the vertical 4s in columns 6-7.\n\nPutting it all together, the possible additions are:\n\n- For the horizontal 3s in row 4: added 3s in (3,10), (2,11).\n- For the vertical 4s: added 4s in (3,8), (4,9) (but 4,9 is 3, so skip), (5,10), (6,11).\n- For the individual 3s in columns 4 and 9 of rows 0-3: added 3s in diagonal positions.\n\nBut this is speculative. Looking back at the training examples, Example 1's input has a 6 in (0,4), and the output adds 6s in (3,1) and (4,0). That's a diagonal down-left. So maybe each 6 adds a diagonal line moving down-left, three steps. So 6/2=3 steps.\n\nIf we apply that logic to the 3s in the test input:\n\nEach 3 in columns 4 and 9 of rows 0-3 would add a diagonal line moving down-left, with steps equal to 3/ something. For example, 3/ something. Maybe 3 steps. For row 0, column 4 (3), moving down-left 3 steps: row 0+3=3, column 4-3=1 \u2192 (3,1). Add 3 there. Similarly, for row 0, column 9: 3 steps down-left: row 3, column 9-3=6 \u2192 (3,6). But (3,6) is zero in the input.\n\nSo added 3s at (3,1) and (3,6).\n\nBut how does this fit with the other examples.\n\nAlternatively, for each 3, add a diagonal step of 3 rows down and 3 columns left. But row 0 column 4 \u2192 row 3 column 1. Which is zero. Add 3 there. Then row 3 column 1 is added a 3.\n\nSimilarly, row 0 column 9 \u2192 row 3 column 6. Which is zero. Add 3 there.\n\nRow 1 column 4 \u2192 row 4 column 1. Which is zero. Add 3.\n\nRow 1 column 9 \u2192 row 4 column 6. Which is zero. Add 3.\n\nRow 2 column 4 \u2192 row 5 column 1. Add 3.\n\nRow 2 column 9 \u2192 row 5 column 6. Add 3.\n\nRow 3 column 4 \u2192 row 6 column 1. Add 3.\n\nRow 3 column 9 \u2192 row 6 column 6. Add 3.\n\nBut this would add a lot of 3s. But looking at the examples, in Example 1, only the original 6 in row 0 column 4 adds 6s in (3,1) and (4,0). Wait, how does that fit. The original 6 is in (0,4). If steps are 3 down and left, that would be (3,1). Then another step down and left to (4,0). So two steps: 3 and 1 steps.\n\nSo maybe the number of steps is equal to the number's value divided by 2. 6/2=3 steps. Then 3/2=1.5 steps, but since we can't have half steps, maybe it rounds down. So 3/2=1 step.\n\nSo for each number, the added steps are number divided by 2. For 3: 1 step down-left. So from (0,4), move 1 step down-left to (1,3). But in Example 0, the added 3s are 3 steps down-right. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach is leading me in circles. Given the time, perhaps the best is to look for the test input's output based on the most plausible pattern from the examples.\n\nAssuming that for each horizontal line of a number, we add a diagonal line of the same number starting from the end of the line and moving up-right. And for vertical lines, add a diagonal line down-right from the bottom end.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\n- The horizontal line of 3s in row 4, columns 4-9. The end is at (4,9). Add 3s up-right: row 3 column 10, row 2 column 11. Both positions are zeros.\n\n- The vertical line of 4s in columns 6-7, rows 0-2. The bottom end is (2,7). Add 4s down-right: row 3 column 8, row 4 column 9 (3 here, so skip), row 5 column 10, row 6 column 11.\n\nAdditionally, for the individual 3s in columns 4 and 9 of rows 0-3, maybe each adds a 3 in a diagonal down-left. For example:\n\n- Row 0 column 4: down-left to (3,1) (0+3,4-3=1). Add 3.\n\n- Row 0 column 9: down-left to (3,6). Add 3.\n\n- Row 1 column 4: down-left to (4,1). Add 3.\n\n- Row 1 column 9: down-left to (4,6). Add 3.\n\n- Row 2 column 4: down-left to (5,1). Add 3.\n\n- Row 2 column 9: down-left to (5,6). Add 3.\n\n- Row 3 column 4: down-left to (6,1). Add 3.\n\n- Row 3 column 9: down-left to (6,6). Add 3.\n\nBut this would add a lot of 3s, but in the examples, the additions are more conservative. For example, in Example 0, the original 3s are in the first two rows, but the added 3s are only two. So perhaps only the main blocks are considered, not individual cells.\n\nAlternatively, only the horizontal and vertical blocks add diagonals, not individual cells.\n\nSo, focusing on the horizontal and vertical blocks:\n\nThe horizontal 3s in row 4 would add 3s at (3,10) and (2,11).\n\nThe vertical 4s would add 4s at (3,8), (5,10), (6,11).\n\nThen, the test input's output would have these changes. Let's write out the rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,3,0,4,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow 1: same as input.\n\nRow 2: same as input, but column 11 becomes 3.\n\nRow 3: column 8 becomes 4, column 10 becomes 3.\n\nRow 4: column 9 is 3 (existing), no change.\n\nRow 5: column 10 becomes 4.\n\nRow 6: column 11 becomes 4.\n\nOther rows remain zeros.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's output, the added numbers are placed in lower rows. For instance, the 6s are added in row 3 and 4. So in the test input's case, the added 3s and 4s would be in rows 2-6.\n\nBut the test input's output needs to follow the format. Based on this, the final answer would modify the lower rows (rows 5-6) and some middle rows (rows 2-3) with 3s and 4s.\n\nPutting this together, the test output would look like:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,3,0,4,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow 1: same.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,3,0,4,4,0,3,0,3] (column 11 is 3)\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,4,3,3,0] (column 8 is 4, column 10 is 3)\n\nRow 4: unchanged except column 9 is already 3.\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]\n\nRows 7-11: all zeros.\n\nBut this is just a guess. The actual pattern may be different, but given the time, this is the best I can do.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids in the training examples. Let me go through each example one by one and see if I can spot any similarities or rules.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a 6x6 grid. The output seems to have some new numbers added towards the bottom. The original rows are mostly the same except the last two rows. Looking at the output's fourth row (index 4), there's a 3 added in position 4, and the last row has a 3 in position 5. Maybe there's something related to moving or adding numbers based on certain positions. \n\nLooking at the non-zero numbers in the input. The 3s and 9s form some kind of structure. Maybe the output is adding numbers below these structures. For instance, the 9s form a cross in the middle. The added 3s are diagonally placed two rows below the main structure. Hmm, maybe when there's a solid block of numbers, like the 9s in the fourth row, we add numbers diagonally below them after a certain number of rows.\n\nExample 1's input is an 8x8 grid. The output has 6s added in specific positions. The original input has a lot of 8s forming a sort of horizontal line in the third row. The output adds a 6 in the fourth row, position 1 and 7. Then another 6 in the fifth row, position 0. It looks like these 6s are placed below the 8s structure but in a staggered way. Maybe each non-zero block in the input causes certain numbers to be added diagonally downwards, maybe after a gap of one or two rows. The number added seems to be the same as a neighboring number. In Example 1, the 6 in the input's first row might be the source for the added 6s.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 4s forming a rectangle and 2s inside. The output adds 2s in the upper part. The added 2s start at row 3 (from the bottom?) and form a diagonal going up and left. The original 2s are in rows 7 and 8. The added 2s are in rows 3 and 4 of the output. So perhaps the 2s are propagating upwards in a diagonal pattern. The number of added elements might correspond to the size of the original structure. Also, the value added is the same as the original number (like 2 here).\n\nExample 3's input is a 12x12 grid. The output adds 4s in the upper rows. The original 4s are in rows 7-11. The added 4s start from row 0, position 10, then row 1 position 9, etc., forming a diagonal going up and left. The 5s are in rows 5 and 6, but the added numbers here are 4s. Wait, the 4s are part of the input's lower rows. So maybe the added numbers are propagating upwards diagonally from the topmost part of the 4 structure. The 4s in the input start at row 7, so the output adds 4s in rows 0-5, but in a diagonal way. The pattern here seems to be that for each solid block of a number, you add that number in a diagonal line upwards and to the left, starting a few rows above the original block.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern might be: For each contiguous block of a number (like 9s, 8s, 4s, 2s, etc.), you add that number in a diagonal pattern above the block, starting a certain number of rows away. The direction could be upwards and to the left, and the number of steps depends on the position of the original block.\n\nLooking at the test input. The test input has a grid with 3s and 4s. The 3s are arranged in a vertical line in columns 4 and 9, and then a horizontal line in row 4. The 4s are in columns 6 and 7 of the first few rows. \n\nIf the pattern is to add numbers diagonally upwards and to the left from the top of the original block, then for the 3s, perhaps we need to place 3s in a diagonal above their structure. The original 3s in rows 0-4 (since row 4 has a horizontal line of 3s). The top of the 3 structure is row 0, so maybe adding 3s starting from a higher row. Wait, in the examples, the added numbers are placed below the original in Example 0, but above in Example 3. Hmm, maybe it depends on the structure's position.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the 4s start at row 7. The added 4s are in rows 0-5, moving upwards each row and to the left. So each added 4 is one row above and one column left. Starting from row 5, column 5 (the 5s in row 5) but that example's added numbers are 4s. Wait, maybe the diagonal starts from the top of the original block and propagates upwards and left. So for the 4s in Example 3, which start at row 7, the added 4s start at row 5 (since the output's first added 4 is in row 0, column 10, but that's part of the upper rows. Wait, maybe I need to calculate the distance from the original block.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the added numbers are placed a certain distance above the original structure. For example, in Example 0, the 9s are in row 3 (0-based). The added 3s are in rows 4 and 5. Wait, that's below. But in Example 3, the 5s are in row 5, and the added 4s start at row 0. Hmm, maybe the direction depends on the number. Or perhaps there's another factor.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the first occurrence of a number in a column and then creating a diagonal upwards. For instance, in Example 3, the 4s are in columns 0-3 starting from row 7. The added 4s start from row 0's column 10, moving left each row. Maybe the diagonal starts from the top right of the grid and moves left and down, but how does that relate to the original structure?\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that for each column in the original grid that has a certain number, we add that number in a diagonal pattern starting from the top of the grid, moving down and to the left. Let me check the examples again.\n\nIn Example 0, the 9s are in columns 3 of rows 0-3. The output adds 3s in the lower rows. Wait, maybe the numbers added are the same as the number from the original block but placed in a diagonal starting from the top of the structure. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each contiguous block of a number in the input is mirrored or extended in some diagonal direction. For example, in Example 0, the 3s are in the first two rows. The output adds 3s two rows below, diagonally. Similarly, the 9s in the middle might have 9s added, but in this case, they added 3s. Wait, that might not make sense. Maybe the added number is the same as the original number. But in Example 0, the added numbers are 3s, but the original structure has 9s. Wait, that's confusing. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the first two rows have 3s. The output adds two 3s in the fifth and sixth rows, positions 4 and 5. Maybe they are placed diagonally two rows below the original 3s. The original 3s are in rows 0 and 1. The added 3s are in rows 4 and 5. So perhaps each original block of a number leads to placing that number two rows below, but shifted to the right. But why 3s? The original 3s are at the start, and the added ones are at positions 4 and 5. That might not align. Alternatively, the 9s in the input form a cross. The output adds 3s in positions that are a certain distance from the 9s. But why 3s here?\n\nWait, maybe the number added is the same as the number in the original block. But in Example 0, the added numbers are 3s. The original 3s are in rows 0 and 1. The output adds two 3s in rows 4 and 5. So maybe after a gap of three rows (since rows 0 and 1 to 4 and 5 is a gap of three rows), the 3s are added diagonally. Similarly, the 9s don't seem to have numbers added. Maybe the pattern is that each number in the original grid, when part of a contiguous block, is added diagonally downwards after a certain number of rows. \n\nIn Example 1, the 8s form a horizontal line in row 2. The output adds 6s in rows 3 and 4. The 6 in the input is in row 0, column 4. The added 6s are in row 3 column 1 and 7, and row 4 column 0. This seems like the 6 from the input is being placed in a diagonal pattern moving left and down. For example, starting from (0,4), moving down and left: (3,1) and (4,0). But the original 6 is in (0,4). The added 6s are further down and left. So perhaps each number in the input is placed again in a diagonal line starting from their original position and moving down and left. But why the specific positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the number of rows below the original number. For Example 0's 3s, the added 3s are three rows below. For Example 1's 6, it's three rows below. But the positions vary. Maybe the displacement is based on the number's value. 3 would mean three steps down and right? But in Example 0, the 3 is added three rows down and shifted right. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the displacement could be such that each number is placed in the same column but a certain number of rows below. But in Example 0, the original 3s are in columns 0-1. The added 3s are in columns 4 and 5, which doesn't match.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the number of non-zero elements in each row. In Example 0's input, rows 0 and 1 have two 3s each. The output adds 3s in rows 4 and 5. Maybe the count of non-zero elements in a row determines where new numbers are placed. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2: the input has a 4 structure. The output adds 2s above. The original 2s are in rows 7 and 8. The added 2s are in row 3 (index 3) and 4. So maybe the distance is four rows above. The added 2s are placed diagonally upwards and to the left. For each 2 in the original, a 2 is placed four rows up and shifted left?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of added elements corresponds to the height of the original structure. For instance, the 4s in Example 2's input form a 4x4 block. The added 2s form a diagonal of length two, but that might not align.\n\nAnother thought: the added numbers are forming a diagonal pattern that starts from the upper right corner of the original structure. For Example 3, the original 4s are in the lower left. The added 4s form a diagonal going up and to the right. Wait, in Example 3's output, the added 4s start at row 0, column 10, then row 1 column 9, etc., up to row 4 column 6. So it's a diagonal from (0,10) to (4,6), each step down and left. That's a diagonal going down and left. But how does that relate to the original 4s? The original 4s are in columns 0-3 of rows 7-11. The added 4s start in row 0, column 10. Maybe the number of rows above the original structure determines where the diagonal starts. Like, the top of the original 4s is row 7, so the diagonal starts in row 7 - 7 = 0? Maybe the distance is the row index of the top of the structure subtracted from the total rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each number, you create a diagonal line of that number starting from the top right of the grid, moving down and left, but only if there's a corresponding structure in the original. For example, in Example 3, the 4s in the lower left cause 4s to be added along a diagonal from top right to bottom left.\n\nBut this seems a bit vague. Let me try to find a common rule across all examples.\n\nIn all examples, the output has new numbers added in a diagonal pattern. The value of the new numbers matches one of the numbers present in the input. The diagonal starts from a certain point and moves in a particular direction. The direction seems to vary: in Example 3 it's up and left, in Example 0 it's down and right, in Example 1 it's down and left. Wait, maybe the direction depends on the number's position. For instance, numbers on the left side of the grid are mirrored to the right in a diagonal, and numbers on the right are mirrored to the left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the added numbers are placed in positions that mirror the original structure across some axis. For example, mirroring horizontally and then shifting down. But looking at Example 0, the original 3s are in the top-left. The added 3s are in the bottom, shifted to the right. So perhaps mirrored across the vertical axis and then shifted down.\n\nAnother possibility is that the added numbers are placed such that each original number's position (i,j) is mapped to (n-1 - i + k, j + k) for some k, but this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, considering the sum of indices. For example, in Example 3's added 4s: row 0 column 10 (sum 10), row 1 column 9 (sum 10), row 2 column 8 (sum 10), etc. The sum of row and column is constant. So for a 12x12 grid, the diagonal where i + j = 10. So each added 4 is along that diagonal. But why 10? The original 4s are in columns 0-3, rows 7-11. The sum for those would be i + j ranges from 7+0=7 up to 11+3=14. But the added 4s are along i + j = 10. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal for the added numbers in Example 3 is i + j = 10. Let's check for other examples. In Example 1's output, the added 6s are at (3,1) and (4,0). Sums are 4 and 4. So sum 4. Original 6 is at (0,4), sum 4. So maybe the added numbers are placed along the same diagonal sum as the original. The 6 in the input is at (0,4) sum 4. The added 6s are at (3,1) sum 4 and (4,0) sum 4. That matches. So maybe the rule is: for each number in the input, place additional copies of that number along the diagonal where i - j is constant (or i + j is constant). Wait, in Example 0's input, the original 3s are in positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). The added 3s are at (4,4) and (5,5). For those, the difference i - j is 0. The original 3s have i - j of 0, -1, 1, 0. Not sure. But the added 3s are along i = j starting from 4.\n\nAlternatively, for each number, after the original block, the number is placed along a diagonal that starts at a certain point and moves down and right. In Example 0, the added 3s form a diagonal from (4,4) to (5,5). The original 3s are in the first two rows. So maybe the added numbers are placed starting three rows below the original and forming a diagonal.\n\nIn Example 1, the original 6 is at (0,4). The added 6s are at (3,1) and (4,0). So three rows below, three columns left, then four rows below, four columns left. That's a diagonal moving down and left. So maybe for each number, you create a diagonal starting three rows below and moving left by the same amount. But why three?\n\nAlternatively, the displacement is related to the number's value. For example, 6 in Example 1: the displacement is 3 (since 6 divided by 2 is 3?), leading to adding 3 rows down and 3 columns left. But in Example 0, the 3s are added three rows down and shifted right. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a common theme across all examples:\n\n- The added numbers form diagonal lines.\n- The value of the added numbers corresponds to a value in the input.\n- The direction of the diagonal varies, but seems to be determined by the position of the original number or block.\n\nAnother approach: For each number in the input, when it's part of a contiguous block (like a line or rectangle), we add a diagonal line of that number in a specific direction. The direction is either up-left, down-left, etc., based on the block's position.\n\nFor example, in Example 3, the 4s are in the lower left. The added 4s form a diagonal going up and to the right (or the added numbers start from the top right and move down-left). This could be a mirroring across the main diagonal. For Example 3's input, the 4s are on the left, so the added 4s are on the right.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the original 6 is in column 4 of row 0, and the added 6s are on the left side, moving down. Maybe the added numbers are mirrored across the vertical center line. For an 8x8 grid, column 4 is the center. So mirroring 4 would be column 3, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the added numbers are placed in positions that are mirrored across the center of the grid. For Example 0, a 6x6 grid. The original 3s are in columns 0-1. The added 3s are in columns 4-5, which are the mirrored columns (since 5 is 6-1 -1 = 4, maybe). So mirroring columns. But rows: original rows 0-1, added in 4-5. Rows mirrored: 6-1 -0=5, 6-1-1=4. So rows 0-1 mirrored would be rows 5-4. So the added 3s are in rows 4-5, columns 4-5. That's possible.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for each contiguous block in the input, mirror it across the center of the grid both vertically and horizontally. So for a grid of size N x N, the mirrored position of (i,j) is (N-1 -i, N-1 -j). Let's check Example 0.\n\nOriginal 3s are at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). The mirrored positions would be (5,5), (5,4), (4,5), (4,4). But the output's added 3s are at (4,4) and (5,5). So perhaps only some of the mirrored positions are filled. Maybe for each corner of the original block, place a mirrored number. Not sure.\n\nExample 0's output has two 3s added. So maybe for each corner of the original block, a mirrored one is added. Original has four corners, but output has two. Hmm. This might not fit.\n\nAnother angle: the added numbers form a diagonal that's a certain distance from the original structure. For instance, in Example 3, the added 4s form a diagonal that's 7 rows above the original 4s (since original is in row 7, added starts at row 0). But 7 rows above would be row 0. Then, each subsequent row steps down and left. So perhaps the distance is determined by the number's value. But 4 in Example 3 would mean 4 rows up, but the original is in row 7, added starts at row 0. 7 - 0 =7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of added elements corresponds to the number of rows or columns in the original block. For example, in Example 3, the 4s are in 5 rows (rows 7-11). The added 4s are in 5 rows (0-4). So perhaps the same number of rows, but mirrored.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Maybe I should look for a pattern in how the new numbers are placed relative to the original ones.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nOriginal 3s are in rows 0-1, columns 0-1.\n\nAdded 3s in rows 4-5, columns 4-5. So each original (i,j) is transformed to (i+4, j+4). But 0+4=4, 1+4=5. So yes, that fits. But why 4? Maybe the grid size is 6, so 6/2 =3. So 3 rows below? Not sure.\n\nExample 1's added 6s: Original 6 is at (0,4). Added at (3,1) and (4,0). The difference in rows is 3 and 4. Columns difference is -3 and -4. So rows increase by 3 and 4, columns decrease by 3 and 4. But why?\n\nExample 3's added 4s: Original 4s start at row 7. Added 4s start at row 0. So row difference is -7. Columns start at 0-3, added columns 10,9,8,... So columns difference is +10. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the added numbers form a diagonal that starts from the top-right corner of the grid, and the number of steps is determined by the original number's position. For example, in Example 3, the first added 4 is at (0,10). The original 4s are in column 0. So 10 is the last column index (11-1=10 for 12 columns). So perhaps the added numbers start at the top right and move down-left for each occurrence of the number in the original grid.\n\nBut how to determine which numbers are added? Maybe each number present in the grid has its own diagonal added in the upper part of the grid, starting from the top right and moving down-left. The length of the diagonal corresponds to the number's value or the size of its block.\n\nAlternatively, the diagonal added numbers are the same as the number's value, and their positions are such that their row plus column equals a certain value. For example, in Example 0's added 3s, (4,4) sum 8, (5,5) sum 10. Doesn't match. In Example 1's added 6s, (3,1) sum 4, (4,0) sum 4. The original 6 is at (0,4) sum 4. So same sum. Ah, this seems consistent. So for each number, the added positions have the same i + j as the original number. \n\nLet's check:\n\nExample 0: Original 3s are at positions (0,0) sum 0, (0,1) sum 1, (1,0) sum 1, (1,1) sum 2. The added 3s are at (4,4) sum 8 and (5,5) sum 10. That doesn't match. So that theory is incorrect.\n\nExample 1: Original 6 is at (0,4) sum 4. Added 6s are at (3,1) sum 4 and (4,0) sum 4. This fits. So perhaps for each number in the input, new instances are added such that i + j remains the same. But why in Example 0 this doesn't hold? Unless the added numbers are for different original numbers.\n\nWait, in Example 0's output, the added 3s are at (4,4) and (5,5). The sum for (4,4) is 8, (5,5) is 10. The original 3s are in positions with sums 0,1,2. Not matching. So perhaps this only applies to certain examples.\n\nIn Example 3's output, the added 4s start at (0,10) sum 10, (1,9) sum 10, etc. So sum is 10 for all added 4s. The original 4s are in rows 7-11, columns 0-3. Their sums range from 7 to 14. So the added 4s have a fixed sum of 10, which might not relate to the original positions. Unless the sum is based on the number's value. For example, 4: 10 = 4 + 6, but not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the added numbers are placed in previously zero positions. So the transformation doesn't overwrite existing non-zero elements.\n\nNow, looking at the test input. Let's see:\n\nThe test input is a 12x12 grid. The first four rows have 3s in column 4 and 9. Then, row 4 has a horizontal line of 3s from column 4 to 9. There are 4s in columns 6 and 7 of rows 0-3. The rest are zeros.\n\nFollowing the pattern from the examples, perhaps we need to add 3s and 4s in diagonal positions above or below their original structures.\n\nFor the 3s: in rows 0-4. The horizontal line is in row 4. Maybe the added 3s are placed in a diagonal starting from row 4 plus some offset. For example, in Example 0, the added 3s were two rows below. Here, maybe adding 3s three rows below row 4, which would be row 7, but the test input's rows 5-11 are zeros. Let's look. The test input's rows 5-11 are all zeros. So maybe adding 3s in rows 7-11, but how?\n\nAlternatively, considering the original 3s form a vertical line in columns 4 and 9 of rows 0-3, and a horizontal line in row 4. The added 3s might form a diagonal starting from the end of the horizontal line. The horizontal line ends at column 9 in row 4. Adding a diagonal of 3s moving down and right from there. For example, row 5, column 10; row 6, column 11. But the test output's rows are 12x12, so column indices go up to 11. However, the original test input's row 4 has columns 4-9 as 3s. Maybe the added 3s are placed diagonally down and to the right, starting from (4,9). So in row 5, column 10; row 6, column 11. But those are zeros in the input. The output would have 3s there. But according to the examples, like Example 0's added 3s are two rows below, perhaps for this test case, the 3s are added starting two rows below row 4. So rows 6 and 7. But I'm not sure.\n\nFor the 4s in columns 6 and 7, rows 0-3. The original 4s form a vertical line. Looking at Example 3, where 4s were in lower rows, the added 4s were in upper rows in a diagonal. So perhaps for these 4s, the added numbers would be in a diagonal upwards and to the left. For example, starting from the top of the 4s (row 0, columns 6-7), adding 4s in rows 0-3, but that's already occupied. Alternatively, moving upwards, but the grid only has rows up to 11. Or maybe the added 4s are in higher rows than the original, but the original are already in the top rows. Alternatively, moving diagonally down and left.\n\nBut this is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to apply the pattern from Example 3 to the test case's 4s.\n\nIn Example 3, the 4s were in rows 7-11, columns 0-3. The added 4s were in rows 0-4, columns 10-6 (decreasing). So the diagonal starts at row 0, column 10 and moves down-left. For the test case's 4s in rows 0-3, columns 6-7, the added 4s would be in a diagonal starting from row 0's column 6-7 and moving down-left. But since the original 4s are already in the top rows, where would they be added? Maybe shifted to the left and down. But the grid has 12 rows, so maybe the added 4s start from row 0, columns 6-7 and move down-left each row. For example:\n\nRow 0: 6,7 (original)\nRow 1: 5,6 (added)\nRow 2: 4,5 (added)\nEtc. But this might not fit. Alternatively, like Example 3, the added numbers form a diagonal starting from the top right of the grid. For the test input's 4s, which are in the top middle, the added 4s might form a diagonal towards the bottom left.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of the test input's 4s as being in columns 6-7 of rows 0-3. Perhaps the added 4s would be placed in a diagonal starting from (0,6) and moving down-right, but how many steps? Or maybe they form a diagonal that starts from a certain position based on the number's value. For example, 4 would mean 4 steps.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Example 3, the added 4s formed a diagonal where i + j = 10. For the test input's 4s, maybe i + j is 10 as well. Let's see: rows 0-3, columns 6-7. For row 0, column 6: sum 6. Column 7: sum 7. For added 4s to have sum 10, they would be at (4,6), (3,7), etc. But that's in the original 3's area. Alternatively, the sum might be different.\n\nAlternatively, the added numbers are placed in a diagonal such that their positions are determined by the formula: for each original number at (i,j), added numbers are placed at (k, l) where k = i + number and l = j - number. For example, 3 would mean 3 down and 3 left. But let's check:\n\nExample 1's original 6 is at (0,4). number is 6. So k = 0 +6=6, l=4-6= -2. That's out of bounds. But the added 6s are at (3,1) and (4,0). So maybe 6/2=3, so 3 down and 3 left. 0+3=3, 4-3=1. That's (3,1). Then 4+0=4, 0=0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of steps is the number's value divided by some factor. For example, 6 becomes 3 steps. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for the following:\n\nIn the training examples, the added numbers are placed in diagonals that seem to originate from the original numbers and extend in a particular direction, often moving down and left or up and right, with the exact direction depending on the example.\n\nIn the test input, the 3s form a vertical line in columns 4 and 9 of rows 0-3, and a horizontal line in row 4. The 4s are in columns 6-7 of rows 0-3.\n\nApplying the pattern from the examples, especially Example 3, where the added numbers formed a diagonal in the upper rows moving left, I would expect the 4s in the test input to have added 4s in a diagonal starting from the top right. For example, the first added 4 would be in row 0, column 11 (but the test input's row 0 has 4s up to column 7). Alternatively, the added 4s could form a diagonal moving down and to the right from the original 4s. For example, from (0,6) down to (11,17), but that's out of bounds.\n\nAlternatively, the added 3s would be placed in a diagonal below the horizontal line in row 4. For example, in rows 5-11, columns 4+ steps and 9+ steps. So row 5, columns 5 and 10; row 6, 6 and 11; etc. But since the grid is 12x12, columns 11 are allowed. But the test output needs to have those positions filled with 3s.\n\nSimilarly, the 4s in rows 0-3, columns 6-7 could have added 4s in a diagonal moving down and left. For example, row 4, columns 5-6; row 5, 4-5; etc., forming a diagonal.\n\nLooking at the training examples' outputs, the added numbers often form a diagonal that starts from the original structure and extends in a direction. For the test input:\n\n- The 3s in row 4 (columns 4-9) could have added 3s in rows 5 and 6, columns 5 and 10, 6 and 11, etc. But in the test input, the output needs to reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, following Example 0's pattern, where the added 3s are placed in rows that are two rows below the original 3s' structure. The original 3s in row 4 (the horizontal line) would have added 3s two rows below (row 6 and 7), shifted to the right. For example, row 6, column 6 and 7; row 7, column 7 and 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Example 0, the 3s were added in a diagonal pattern two rows below their original position. So for the test input's 3s in row 4, the added 3s would be in row 6, column 5 and 10, then row 7, column 6 and 11. But this might not fit the pattern.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, but based on the training examples, the added numbers seem to form diagonal lines of the same value, placed a certain distance away from the original structures, either upwards or downwards. \n\nFor the test input's 3s and 4s, perhaps the 3s are added in a diagonal below the horizontal line (row 4), and the 4s are added in a diagonal above their vertical structure.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nThe 3s in row 4, columns 4-9. Added 3s could be in rows 5-11, columns increasing by 1 each row. For example, row 5, column 5; row 6, 6; etc. But the test input's original rows 5-11 are all zeros, so this is possible.\n\nThe 4s in rows 0-3, columns 6-7. Added 4s could be in a diagonal going upwards and to the left. But since they are already in the top rows, perhaps they are added in the upper part of the grid. For example, starting from row 0, columns 6-7, then row -1, which is invalid. So maybe the 4s are added in a diagonal downwards and to the left. For example, row 4, column 5; row 5, column 4; etc.\n\nBut how to determine the exact positions? Given that time is limited, perhaps the best approach is to try to identify that the pattern involves adding diagonal lines of the same numbers as the original, starting from certain points and moving in a specific direction. For the test case, the output will have added 3s and 4s in diagonal patterns.\n\nLooking at the training examples, the number added is the same as the original number, and the diagonal direction is such that for numbers in the lower part of the grid, the added numbers are in the upper part (Example 3), and for numbers in the upper part, the added numbers are in the lower part (Example 0). So maybe it's a reflection across the middle row.\n\nFor the test input's 3s in row 4 (middle of the 12-row grid?), the added 3s would be mirrored below. For a 12-row grid, middle row is between 5 and 6. Row 4 is above, so the mirror would be row 7. So row 4's 3s would be mirrored to row 7. Then, the diagonal would continue from there. For example, the original 3s in row 4 are columns 4-9. The mirrored row would be row 7 (since 12-1 -4=7). So in row 7, columns 4-9, but those are zeros in the input. The output would have 3s there. Then, perhaps the diagonal continues with 3s in row 8, columns 5-10; row 9, columns 6-11. But since the grid is 12x12, columns 11 are allowed. However, in the test input's rows 5-11 are all zeros, so this could be.\n\nFor the 4s in rows 0-3, the mirror would be rows 11-8. So adding 4s in rows 8-11, columns 6-7. But the input's rows 8-11 are zeros. The output could have 4s in those positions. But the training examples added numbers in a diagonal, not a direct mirror. Maybe instead, the added numbers form a diagonal from the mirrored position.\n\nAlternatively, the added numbers for the 4s would be placed in a diagonal moving down and left from their original position. For example, row 0, columns 6-7: added in row 1, columns 5-6; row 2, columns 4-5; etc. But this would overlap with existing 3s and 4s. But according to the examples, added numbers are placed in zeros.\n\nAlternatively, the added numbers are placed in a diagonal starting from the top-right corner of the grid. For the 4s, this would mean starting at row 0, column 11 and moving down-left. So (0,11), (1,10), (2,9), etc. Each step down and left. The value would be 4. But the original 4s are in columns 6-7. This may not relate directly.\n\nConsidering Example 3's added 4s formed a diagonal in the upper rows, perhaps for the test case's 4s, which are in the upper rows, the added 4s would be in the lower rows. For example, starting from row 8, column 6 and moving down-left. So row 8, column 6; row 9, column 5; row 10, column 4; row 11, column 3. But why those positions?\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on the patterns observed.\n\nThe test input's 3s are in row 4 (columns 4-9). Following Example 0's pattern, where the added 3s were two rows below, perhaps the added 3s here are in rows 5 and 6. For example, in row 5, column 5 and 10; row 6, column 6 and 11. Then, row 7, column 7 (but since the original row 4 ends at column 9, maybe the diagonal continues with 3s in row 5 column 5, row 6 column 6, etc., until column 11.\n\nFor the 4s in rows 0-3, columns 6-7. Following Example 3's pattern, where the added 4s were in a diagonal starting from the top right, perhaps here the added 4s start from row 0, column 11 and move down-left. So:\n\nRow 0: column 11 \u2192 4\nRow 1: column 10 \u2192 4\nRow 2: column 9 \u2192 4\nRow 3: column 8 \u2192 4\nRow 4: column 7 \u2192 4 (but original 3s are here)\nRow 5: column 6 \u2192 4\nRow 6: column 5 \u2192 4\nRow 7: column 4 \u2192 4\nRow 8: column 3 \u2192 4\nRow 9: column 2 \u2192 4\nRow 10: column 1 \u21924\nRow 11: column 0 \u21924\n\nBut this would overwrite existing 3s in row 4, column 7. However, according to the training examples, added numbers are placed in zeros. So where the added 4s and 3s would overlap with existing non-zero numbers, they are skipped.\n\nAlternatively, the added 4s start from a different point. For example, in Example 3, the added 4s started from row 0, column 10. The test input's 4s are in columns 6-7. So perhaps the added 4s start from row 0, column (12-1 -6)=5, which is 5. But not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to produce an answer, I'll proceed to write the output based on the following assumptions:\n\n- For the 3s in row 4, columns 4-9, the added 3s form a diagonal starting two rows below, shifting right each row. So row 5, column 5; row 6, column 6; row 7, column 7; etc., up to column 11.\n\n- For the 4s in rows 0-3, columns 6-7, the added 4s form a diagonal starting from the top right of the grid and moving down-left. So row 0, column 11; row 1, column 10; row 2, column 9; row 3, column 8; row 4, column 7; but row 4, column 7 has a 3, so it's skipped. Then row 5, column 6; which is zero. Etc.\n\nApplying this, the output would have:\n\nFor 3s:\nRow 5: column 5\nRow 6: column 6\nRow 7: column 7\nRow 8: column 8\nRow 9: column 9\nRow 10: column 10\nRow 11: column 11\n\nBut the original 3s in row 4 are columns 4-9. So the added 3s would start from column 5 in row 5, incrementing each row. This would create a diagonal of 3s from (5,5) to (11,11).\n\nFor 4s:\nRow 0: column 11\nRow 1: column 10\nRow 2: column 9\nRow 3: column 8\nRow 5: column 6\nRow 6: column 5\nRow 7: column 4\nRow 8: column 3\nRow 9: column 2\nRow 10: column 1\nRow 11: column 0\n\nBut row 4, column 7 has a 3, so it's skipped. So in row 5, column 6 is added a 4. This would create a diagonal of 4s from (0,11) to (11,0), but with some positions skipped.\n\nCombining these, the output would have the original input's rows, with added 3s and 4s in the lower and upper parts, respectively.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, sometimes the added numbers are placed in specific positions, not the entire diagonal. For example, Example 0 added two 3s. So maybe the number of added numbers corresponds to the size of the original block.\n\nThe original 3s in the test input form a larger structure, so the added 3s and 4s would be more extensive.\n\nGiven the complexity, the final answer is likely to have added 3s in a diagonal descending from row 5 to row 11, columns 5 to 11, and added 4s in a diagonal from row 0, column 11 down to row 11, column 0, but only where zeros exist.\n\nSo, applying this to the test input, the output would have the original rows plus these added numbers.",
