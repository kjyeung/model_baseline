        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a list of lists (probably a 9x9 grid) with 0s and 5s, and the output seems to replace some 5s with 1s and 2s. Let me check each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has rows where some positions have 5s. The output replaces those 5s with 1s and 2s. For instance, in the second row of input, there's a 5 at position 2 (third element), and the output has a 1 there. Similarly, in the last few rows, the last element in the output is 2. So maybe the 1s are the first occurrence of 5 in each column, and 2s are subsequent ones? Let's check the columns.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input. Let's check the columns where 5s occur. For column 2 (index 2), the first 5 is in row 1 (input's second row), so in output, it's 1. Then in the next rows, same column, the 5s are replaced with 1s. Wait, no, in the third row of input, column 2 is 5 again, but output still has 1. Hmm, maybe it's counting the number of times 5 appears in the column up to that row. Wait, but in example 0's output, the last column (index 8) has a 2 in the 6th row. Let's check the input: in column 8, the first 5 is in row 6 (input's 7th row, since rows start from 0?), and then it's 5 in rows 7 and 8. So output has 2s there. So maybe 1 is the first occurrence in the column, and 2s are subsequent.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, column 2 has 5s starting from row 1 (second row) all the way down. But in the output, all those positions are 1s except the last few rows where another column has 2s. Wait, maybe it's per column. So for each column, the first occurrence of 5 is replaced by 1, and the second occurrence (and onwards) by 2. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 0's column 2, the 5s start at row 1 and continue all the way. In the output, all those are 1s except maybe the first one. Wait, no, in the output, row 1 (second row) has 1, then all subsequent rows in column 2 have 1. So that doesn't fit the idea of first being 1, others 2. Hmm. Wait maybe the 1s are for the first occurrence in the entire column. So column 2 in Example 0 has 5s from row 1 to 8. The first 5 in column 2 is row 1, so all subsequent 5s in that column would be 2? But in the output, they are all 1. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe it's the first occurrence in each row? No, because in example 0's input row 6 (index 6), there are multiple 5s. The output has 1 in column 2 and 2 in column 8. So maybe each row's first 5 is 1, and others are 2. But looking at input row 6: [5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5]. The output is [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]. So the first 5 is in position 0, but the output has 0. Wait, that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s represent the first occurrence of 5 in the column when viewed from the bottom up. Let's think. For example, in column 8 of example 0, the first occurrence (from bottom) is row 6 (assuming rows are ordered from top to bottom). Wait, rows are listed from top to bottom. If you look from the bottom up, the first occurrence in column 8 is row 8 (the bottom row) has 5. But the output in row 6 (original input row 6) has 2. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's counting the number of 5s in the column up to that row, and if it's the first, mark 1; second, 2, etc. But in example 0's column 2, all the 5s in the output are 1. If the count increases, why are they all 1? That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at example 1's output. In column 4 (index 4), all the 5s in the input are replaced by 1s in the output. But in column 2 (index 2), the first 5 appears in row 7 (input row 7), and the output is 2. Wait, example 1's input:\n\nIn example 1's input, the first 5 in column 2 is in row 7 (input row 7: [5, 0, 5, ...]). The output for that row in column 2 is 2. But the output for column 4 (index 4) in all rows where 5 is present is 1. So why is column 2's first occurrence 2?\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that each column's first occurrence (from the top) of 5 is replaced by 1, and any subsequent 5s in the same column are replaced by 2. Let's check example 0:\n\nIn example 0, column 2 (index 2) has 5s starting from row 1. So the first occurrence is row 1, replaced by 1. All subsequent rows in column 2 are also 5s, but in the output, they are all 1. So that can't be. Because if it's first occurrence 1, others 2, then after row 1, all column 2's entries should be 2. But in example 0's output, they are 1.\n\nHmm, that's conflicting. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAlternative approach: maybe the output is marking the first occurrence of a 5 in each column from the bottom. Let me check example 0's column 8. The input has 5s starting from row 6. The output has 2s in row 6,7,8. Wait, but the first occurrence from the bottom would be row 8. So maybe the last occurrence in the column is 1, and others are 2. Wait, in example 0's column 8, the first 5 is in row 6 (from top), but the output in row 6 is 2. Wait, maybe the opposite: the bottom-most 5 in the column is 2, others are 1? No, example 0's column 8 has 5s in rows 6,7,8. Output rows 6-8 have 2 in column 8. So if the bottom-most is 2, but all are 2, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is counting the number of 5s in the column from the top up to that row. So for each cell, if it's the first 5 in the column when scanning from top to bottom, it becomes 1. Any 5 after that in the same column becomes 2. Let's check example 0:\n\nIn example 0's column 2, the first 5 is row 1. So output row 1 is 1. Then in row 2, same column, 5 is present again. According to the rule, it's the second occurrence, so should be 2. But in the output, row 2's column 2 is 1. So that doesn't fit. So that's not correct.\n\nWait maybe the count is per column, but starting from the bottom. For each cell in the column, count how many 5s are below it (including itself). So if it's the first in the column (from bottom), maybe. Let's take example 0's column 8. The 5s are in rows 6,7,8. From the bottom (row 8), the first occurrence is row 8. So in row 8, count is 1, so 1. Then row 7 has 5, count is 2 (row 7 and 8), so 2. Row 6 has 3, but output is 2. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of 5s in the column up to and including that row. So if a cell is a 5 and it's the first in its column (from top), then 1. If there's another 5 below it, then 2. Wait, perhaps for each 5 in a column, if there's a 5 below it, then it's 2; otherwise 1. Let's test this.\n\nExample 0's column 8:\n\nRows 6,7,8 have 5s. So for row 6, since there are 5s below it (rows 7 and 8), it becomes 2. For row 7, there's a 5 in row 8, so 2. For row 8, no 5 below, so 1. But in the output, rows 6-8 column 8 have 2,2,2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's something else. Let's look at the outputs again.\n\nIn Example 0's output, the 2s appear only in column 8 in the last three rows. The input for those rows has 5s in column 8. So maybe the 2s are when there's a 5 in that position and also in the same column in the row below. Let's check:\n\nTake row 6 of example 0's input: column 8 is 5. The row below (row 7) also has 5 in column 8. So in output row 6, column 8 is 2. Similarly, row 7's column 8 has 5 and row 8's column 8 has 5. So row 7 and 8's column 8 would be 2. But row 8's column 8 is 5 and there is no row below, so perhaps it's 1. But in the output, it's 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are for the cells where the same column in the next row is also 5. So for example, in row 6, column 8 is 5, and row 7, column 8 is 5. So row 6's column 8 becomes 2. Then row 7's column 8 is 5 and row 8's column 8 is 5, so row 7 becomes 2. Row 8's column 8 is 5, no row below, so maybe 1, but output is 2. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, looking at example 1's output. In row 7, column 2 is 2. Looking at the input, row 7 has 5 in column 2. The row below (row 8) also has 5 in column 2. So maybe that's why it's 2. Similarly, row 8's column 2 has 5, but there's no row below, so perhaps it's 1. But in the output, it's 2. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 1 is when the cell is 5 and there's a 5 above it (in the same column). Let's test example 0's column 8. Row 6 is 5. Are there any 5s above it? No. So according to this, row 6's column 8 would be 1. But in output, it's 2. So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output 1 represents a 5 that is the first in its row (left to right), and 2 represents other 5s in the same row. Let's check example 0's input row 6: [5, 0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5]. The output is [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2]. So the first 5 in the row is at index 0, but output is 0. So that doesn't fit. Maybe the first 5 in the row from the right? The first 5 from the right is index 8, which is 2 in output. But other 5s are replaced with 1 in index 2. So maybe the rightmost 5 is 2, others are 1. For example, in row 6, the 5s are at 0,2,4,6,8. The rightmost is 8, which is 2. The others are 1. But in the output, only index 2 is 1 and 8 is 2. The others are 0. So maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, but the output for row 6 in example 0 is [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2]. So only two 5s are converted to 1 and 2. The other 5s (positions 0,4,6) are 0. So perhaps the pattern is not per row.\n\nLet me think differently. Looking at both examples:\n\nIn Example 0, the output 1s are in column 2, and the 2s in column 8. In the input, column 2 has 5s starting from row 1 and continues, and column 8 starts at row 6. The output has 1s in column 2 (all rows where input has 5s) except for the first few rows. Wait, no. In the output, rows 1 through 8 (except row 0) have 1 in column 2, but in the input, row 0 has 0 in column 2. So the first row with 5 in column 2 is row 1. So output row 1 has 1. Then rows 2-8 also have 5s, but their outputs are 1 as well. So maybe column 2 has 1s for all 5s, and column 8's 5s are 2s. So perhaps the rule is that the first occurrence (from top) of any column's 5 is 1, and columns that have multiple 5s have their subsequent 5s as 2. But that doesn't explain why column 8's first occurrence (row 6) is 2 in the output. Wait, in example 0, column 8's first 5 is in row 6. The output for that row's column 8 is 2. That contradicts the idea that first occurrence is 1.\n\nSimilarly, in example 1, column 4 has 5s from row 0. All output 5s in column 4 are 1. So first occurrence is 1, and others are 1. So that's different. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the 1s are the first occurrence in each column from the top, and 2s are the first occurrence in each column from the bottom. Let's see:\n\nIn example 0's column 8, the first occurrence from top is row 6. The first from bottom is row 8. So perhaps the top's first is 1, and the bottom's first is 2. But the output for row 6's column 8 is 2, not 1. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are the first time a column has a 5 when moving from top to bottom, and 2s are the first time a column has a 5 when moving from bottom to top. Let's check example 1's column 2. The first 5 from top is row 7 (input row 7, which is the 8th row if zero-indexed). The first from bottom is row 8. The output for column 2 in row 7 is 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s represent columns where the 5 is the first in its row (left to right), and 2s are other positions. But in example 0's row 6, the first 5 is at index 0, which in output is 0. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is marking the first occurrence of a 5 in each row (left to right) as 1, and the last occurrence in the row as 2. Let's check example 0's row 6 input: [5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5]. The first 5 is at index 0, the last at 8. Output is [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2]. So perhaps in the output, the first occurrence (leftmost) 5 in the row is replaced with 1, and the last occurrence (rightmost) with 2, and any others are 0. Let's see:\n\nIn example 0's row 1 input: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Output is [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The only 5 is at index 2, which is both first and last. So in output, it's 1. But since it's the only one, maybe 1 is for first, and if there are more than one, the last is 2.\n\nIn example 0's row 6, the first 5 is index 0, but output is 0. Wait, that contradicts. Because according to this idea, the first 5 should be 1. But in the output, the first 5 in row 6 is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's look at example 1's output. In row 7, column 2 is 2 and column 4 is 1. The input row 7 is [5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,0]. The output is [0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0]. So here, the first 5 in the row is column 0, but output is 0. The next 5 is column 2, which is 2, and column 4 is 1. So this seems to contradict any row-based pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the 1s and 2s are related to the number of consecutive 5s in the column up to that point. Like, if a cell is part of a vertical run of 5s. Let's check example 0's column 2: all 5s from row 1 onwards. So each 5 is part of a consecutive run. But the output for all those is 1, so that's not explaining the 2s.\n\nWait, looking at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 5 at index 7.\n\nRow 2: 5s at index 3 and 7.\n\nRow 3: same as row 2.\n\nRow 4: 5s at 3,5,7.\n\nRow 5: same as row 4.\n\nRow 6: same.\n\nRow 7: same.\n\nRow 8: 5s at 1,3,5,7.\n\nSo applying the pattern from training examples, what would the output be?\n\nIf the pattern is that for each column, the first occurrence of 5 (from top) is 1, and any subsequent 5s are 2.\n\nLet's test this for example 0:\n\nColumn 2: first 5 is row 1 \u2192 1. All following 5s in column 2 (rows 2-8) are 1. But according to this rule, they should be 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample 1's column 4: all 5s are replaced by 1. So first occurrence is row 0, then all others are 1, which would not fit the previous rule.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output counts the number of 5s in each column, and 1 indicates there's at least one 5 below it, and 2 indicates it's the last one. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 1 if the cell is 5 and the cell directly below is also 5, otherwise 0. But in example 0's row 6, column 8 is 5 and row 7 has 5, so output 2. Wait, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if the cell is 5 and the cell below is not 5, then 1; if the cell below is 5, then 2.\n\nWait, for example 0's column 8:\n\nRow 6: 5, row 7: 5 \u2192 output is 2.\n\nRow 7: 5, row 8:5 \u2192 output 2.\n\nRow 8: 5, no cell below \u2192 output 2. But according to the rule, it would be 1.\n\nHmm. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 1 for the first time a column has a 5, and 2 for when there's a 5 in that column and also in the column to the right. Or something involving neighboring columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the 1s represent the highest occurrence of 5 in each column (the topmost 5), and 2s are any 5s below that. Let's check example 0:\n\nColumn 2's topmost 5 is row 1. Output is 1. All other 5s in column 2 are 1. So no, that doesn't fit. Example 0's column 8: topmost 5 is row 6. Output is 2, which contradicts.\n\nExample 1's column 4: topmost 5 is row 0. All outputs are 1, which fits if 1 is the topmost. Column 2's topmost 5 is row 7. Output is 2, which doesn't fit.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at the outputs, in example 0, the 1s are in column 2 and 2s in column 8. In example 1, the 1s are in column 4 and 2s in column 2. So perhaps the pattern is that each input grid has certain columns where the 5s are converted to 1s and others to 2s. But what determines which column becomes which?\n\nIn example 0, column 2 is converted to 1s and column 8 to 2s. In example 1, column 4 is 1s and column 2 is 2s. So perhaps the columns where the first occurrence of 5 is higher up are 1s, and others are 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the 1s and 2s indicate different columns. For instance, in example 0, maybe the leftmost column with 5s is 2 (index 2), and the rightmost is 8 (index 8). So 1s are in the leftmost, 2s in the rightmost. Similarly, example 1: the leftmost column with 5s is column 4 (since in example 1's input, the first row has 5 in column 4). Wait no, example 1's first row has 5 in column 4. The first row of example 1's input is [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]. So column 4 is the first occurrence of 5 in the entire grid (leftmost column with 5). Then, another column that starts appearing later (like column 6 and column 2) would have their 5s marked as 2. But in example 1, column 2's first 5 is in row 7. So perhaps the leftmost column with 5s in the entire grid is marked as 1s, and any subsequent columns (right to left) have 2s. But example 1's output has column 4 as 1s, and column 2 (which is to the left of column 4) as 2s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the columns are ordered from left to right, and the first column (leftmost) with a 5 in any row is marked as 1s, and the next columns with 5s are marked as 2s. Let's see:\n\nExample 0's input: the first column with a 5 is column 2 (row 1). Then, column 0 appears in row 3. So maybe column 2 is 1s, column 0 is 2s. But in example 0's output, column 0's 5s are 0. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the first occurrence of a 5 in the entire grid (leftmost, topmost) determines the 1 column, and other columns are 2. But in example 0, the first 5 is at row 1, column 2. All 5s in column 2 are 1. Other columns (0,6,4,8) have 5s marked as 0 or 2. For example, column 0's 5s are 0 in output. Column 8's are 2. So perhaps the first column to have a 5 in the grid is marked as 1, and other columns are 2 if they have 5s. But example 1's first 5 is column 4 (row 0), so all 5s in column 4 are 1. The next columns with 5s, like column 6 and column 2, their 5s are 2.\n\nWait, example 1's input has 5s in columns 4, 0,6,2. The first column to have a 5 is column 4. So in the output, column 4's 5s are 1. Other columns (0,6,2) have their 5s converted to 2 if they are in certain positions. But in example 1's output, column 0's 5s are 0. So perhaps only columns that have their first 5 after the initial column (4) are marked as 2. For example, column 2's first 5 is in row 7 (input row 7). So maybe columns that first appear after the initial column are marked as 2s. But in example 1, column 0's first 5 is in row 2 (input row 2, which is after row 0). So why is column 0's output 0? Because maybe only the first column to have a 5 is marked as 1, and others are marked as 2 if they are part of a different pattern.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find another angle.\n\nIn both training examples, the output has 1s in one column and 2s in another. For example 0, it's column 2 and 8. For example 1, column 4 and 2. What's common between those columns? Let's see their positions.\n\nColumn 2 and 8 in example 0: 2 is index 2, 8 is index 8 (the last). In example 1, column 4 (middle) and 2. So maybe the 1s are in columns that are the first to reach a certain height, or something related to the rows where they appear.\n\nAnother observation: in example 0's output, the 2s are in column 8, which is the rightmost column. In example 1's output, the 2s are in column 2, which is to the left. So perhaps the 1s and 2s are the leftmost and rightmost columns that have 5s in any row. But in example 0, the leftmost column with 5 is column 2, rightmost is 8. So 1s in column 2, 2s in 8. In example 1, leftmost column with 5 is 0 (row 2 has 5 in column 0), but the output's 2s are in column 2. Wait, example 1's input has 5 in column 0 starting at row 2, but output has 0s there. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is marking the 5s that form a vertical line. For example, if there's a vertical stack of 5s in a column, the top one is 1 and the rest are 2. But example 0's column 2 has all 5s from row 1 to 8. The output for all those is 1. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the opposite: the bottommost 5 in a column is 2, and the others are 1. For example, in example 0's column 8, the bottom three rows (6,7,8) have 5s, output is 2. But the row 6 is 2 even though it's not the bottom. So that's not.\n\nHmm. Maybe the key is to look for the pattern in the outputs. For each input row, the output has 0s except for one or two 1s and 2s. It seems like each output row has at most one 1 and one 2, sometimes none. \n\nIn example 0's output rows 6-8, there's a 1 in column 2 and a 2 in column 8. So for those rows, there are two non-zero elements. The input rows have multiple 5s, but output only marks two of them. \n\nIn example 1's output, rows 7-8 have a 2 in column 2 and a 1 in column 4. The input for those rows has 5s in columns 0,2,4, etc. So again, the output only marks two positions.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is that each row in the output marks the first and last columns (in the entire grid?) that have 5s. For example, in example 0, the first column with 5s is column 2, and the last is column 8. So in each row, if there's a 5 in column 2, mark as 1; if in column 8, mark as 2. Other 5s are ignored. \n\nSimilarly, in example 1, the first column with 5s is column 4 (since the first row has a 5 there), and the last column with 5s is column 2 (since in the test input, the last column that gets a 5 is column 2 in row 7). So in example 1's output, column 4 is 1 and column 2 is 2. \n\nSo the pattern might be: for the entire grid, identify the leftmost column that has at least one 5 (call it left_col) and the rightmost column that has at least one 5 (call it right_col). Then, in each row of the output, replace any 5 in left_col with 1, any 5 in right_col with 2, and all other 5s with 0.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n\nExample 0's input has left_col as 2 (since column 2 is the first column with a 5 in row 1). The rightmost column with a 5 is 8 (column 8 in row 6). So in each row of the output, 5s in column 2 become 1, 5s in column 8 become 2, others 0. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 1's input: the first column with a 5 is column 4 (row 0). The rightmost column with a 5 is column 2 (since in row 7, column 2 has 5). Wait, in example 1's input, the rightmost 5 in the entire grid is in column 6 (row 3-6) and column 2 (row 7-8). So the rightmost column is 6 until row 7, where column 2 has 5. But columns are numbered 0-8, so column 6 is to the right of column 2. So why in example 1's output is the right_col 2?\n\nWait, in example 1's input, the rightmost column with a 5 is column 6 (appearing in rows 3-6), and column 7 has 5 in row 8. Wait, example 1's input row 8 is [5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,0]. So the rightmost 5 here is column 6. Wait, no. Let's check each row:\n\nIn example 1's input:\n\nRow 0: 5 at column 4.\n\nRow 1: 5 at 4.\n\nRow 2: 5 at 0 and 4.\n\nRow 3: 5 at 0,4,6.\n\nRow 4: same.\n\nRow 5: same.\n\nRow 6: same.\n\nRow 7: 5 at 0,2,4,6.\n\nRow 8: 5 at 0,2,4,6.\n\nSo the rightmost column with a 5 in the entire grid is column 6. But in example 1's output, the right_col is column 6? But in the output, row 7 has a 2 in column 2, not column 6. So this theory must be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the right_col is the rightmost column that appears in the last row of the input. For example, in example 1's last row (row 8), the 5s are in columns 0,2,4,6. The rightmost is column 6. So why is the output's right_col column 2?\n\nHmm, this is conflicting. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the left_col and right_col are determined for each row individually. For each row, the leftmost 5 is replaced with 1, rightmost with 2. Other 5s are 0.\n\nLet's test this with example 0's row 6:\n\nInput row 6: [5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5]. The leftmost 5 is column 0, rightmost is column 8. Output row 6: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2]. So this doesn't fit. According to the theory, leftmost would be 0 (output 1), rightmost 8 (output 2), but in the output, the 1 is at column 2 and 2 at 8. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first and last occurrence of 5 in each row, but only the first and last in the entire grid. For example, the first column where any row has a 5 is the left_col, and the last column where any row has a 5 is the right_col. Then, in each row, any 5 in left_col becomes 1, any in right_col becomes 2, others 0.\n\nExample 0's left_col is 2, right_col is 8. So row 6's 5 in column 2 is 1, column 8 is 2. The others are 0. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 1's left_col is 4 (first occurrence in row 0), right_col is 6 (since in example 1's input, the rightmost column with 5 is 6 in rows 3-8). But example 1's output has 2 in column 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. But in example 1's output, the 2 is in column 2. But in example 1's input, the rightmost column with a 5 is 6. So why is the output's right_col 2? This doesn't fit. So this theory is invalid.\n\nWait, looking back at example 1's output, the 2s are in column 2 starting at row 7. In the input, column 2 has 5s starting at row 7. So perhaps the right_col is determined as the last column to have a 5 in the entire grid. For example, in example 1, the last column to get a 5 (i.e., the rightmost column that is first introduced in the lowest row) is column 2. Because in row 7 and 8, column 2 has 5s. But column 6 also has 5s in those rows. So column 6 is to the right of column 2, so that would be the right_col. But the output has 2 in column 2. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nTest Input rows:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 5 at 7.\n\nRow 2: 5s at 3 and7.\n\nRow 3: same as 2.\n\nRow 4: 5s at 3,5,7.\n\nRow 5-7: same as 4.\n\nRow 8: 5s at 1,3,5,7.\n\nSo, according to the pattern from examples, what would the output be?\n\nIn example 0 and 1, the output's 1s and 2s are in the first and last columns where 5s appear in the entire grid. For example 0, left_col=2 (first column with 5), right_col=8. For example 1, left_col=4 (first column with 5 in row 0), right_col=2 (last column to get a 5 in row7).\n\nWait, in example 1, the first column with a 5 is 4, and the last column to have a 5 introduced is 2. But how is 2 the last column introduced? Because in example 1's input, column 2's first 5 is in row7, which is after rows where columns 0,4,6 have 5s. So the last column to be introduced is 2.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n- left_col is the first column (leftmost) that has a 5 in the entire grid.\n\n- right_col is the last column (rightmost) that has a 5 introduced in the grid (i.e., the highest row where a new column gets a 5 for the first time).\n\nSo, in example 0:\n\n- left_col is 2 (first 5 in row1).\n\n- right_col is 8 (first 5 in row6).\n\nIn example 1:\n\n- left_col is 4 (first 5 in row0).\n\n- right_col is 2 (first 5 in row7).\n\nSo, for the output, any 5 in left_col becomes 1, any 5 in right_col becomes 2, others 0.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nExample 0's row6:\n\nInput has 5 in columns 0,2,4,6,8. left_col=2 (1), right_col=8 (2). So output is [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2]. Which matches.\n\nExample 1's row7:\n\nInput has 5 in columns0,2,4,6. left_col=4 (1), right_col=2 (2). So output is [0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0]. Which matches.\n\nSo this seems to fit.\n\nNow applying this pattern to the test input.\n\nTest input's first column with a 5:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow0: no 5s.\n\nRow1: 5 at 7.\n\nRow2: 5s at3,7.\n\nRow3: same.\n\nRow4: 5s at3,5,7.\n\nRow5-7: same.\n\nRow8:5s at1,3,5,7.\n\nSo the first column to have a 5 is column7 (row1). Then, row2 introduces column3. So earlier than column7. Wait, row1 has 5 in column7. Row2's 5s are in 3 and7. So column3 is introduced in row2, which is after row1. So the first column to have a 5 is column7 (row1). Then column3 (row2). Then column5 (row4). Then column1 (row8).\n\nSo left_col is 7? But that's the first column with a 5. But according to the previous examples, left_col is the leftmost column with a 5. Column7 is not the leftmost. Wait, but in the test input, the first 5 appears in column7 (row1). The next 5s are in column3 (row2), which is to the left of column7. So the leftmost column with a 5 is column3 (row2), but the first 5 in the grid is in column7 (row1). Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, the left_col is supposed to be the leftmost column in the entire grid that contains a 5. So in the test input, the earliest 5 is in row1, column7. Then row2 introduces column3 (which is to the left of7). So the leftmost column with a 5 is column3 (since 3 <7). Even though it was introduced later. So the left_col is 3, since it's the leftmost column that has any 5 in the grid.\n\nBut wait, the leftmost column with any 5 is the minimum column index where a 5 occurs. So in the test input, the columns with 5s are 1,3,5,7. The leftmost is column1 (row8), but wait, row8 is the last row, and column1 is the earliest. Or wait, columns with 5s in the test input:\n\nRow1:7.\n\nRow2:3,7.\n\nRow3:3,7.\n\nRow4:3,5,7.\n\nRow5: same.\n\nRow6: same.\n\nRow7: same.\n\nRow8:1,3,5,7.\n\nSo the columns with 5s are 1,3,5,7. The leftmost is column1 (appears in row8), but column3 appears in row2. So column3 is left of7, so the leftmost column is3, since 3 is the smallest column index with a 5 in any row.\n\nAh, so left_col is3.\n\nThe right_col is the last column to get a 5 introduced. In the test input:\n\nThe columns are introduced as follows:\n\nRow1:7.\n\nRow2:3.\n\nRow4:5.\n\nRow8:1.\n\nSo the last column to be introduced is column1 (row8). So right_col is1.\n\nBut according to the previous examples, the right_col is the column that was introduced last (highest row where a new column gets a 5 for the first time). So in test input, column1 is introduced in row8. So right_col is1.\n\nThus, in the output, all 5s in column3 (left_col) would be replaced with1, and 5s in column1 (right_col) replaced with2. Other 5s become0.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nTest input's row8 has 5 in column1. So output would be 2 there. Column3 has 5s in rows2-8. So their output would be1. Column7 has 5s in rows1-8, but output would be0.\n\nLet's see how this would look.\n\nFor example, row1: input has5 at7. Since left_col is3 and right_col is1, which are not present here. So output would be0. But according to the pattern, any 5 in left_col (3) is1, right_col (1) is2. But row1's 5 is in7, which is neither. So output is0. Which matches the expected pattern.\n\nRow2:5s at3 and7. left_col is3, so 3 becomes1. 7 is0. So output row2: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut in the training examples, the outputs often have only one 1 and/or one 2 per row. So for row2, output would be [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow3: same as row2.\n\nRow4:5s at3,5,7. 3 is1, others 0.\n\nRow5-7: same as row4.\n\nRow8:5s at1,3,5,7. 3 is1,1 is2. So output row8 would be [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut according to the pattern, left_col is3 (1) and right_col is1 (2). So the output for row8 would have 1 in column3 and 2 in column1.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs for example0 and example1 have their 1s and 2s in separate columns. So this seems plausible.\n\nBut according to this, the test input's output would have in each row:\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (since no 5 in left_col or right_col).\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow3: same as row2.\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nRow5-7: same as row4.\n\nRow8: [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nBut let's check if this aligns with the training examples.\n\nIn example0, the left_col is2 and right_col is8. So in any row with 5 in column2, output is1. Any row with 5 in column8, output is2. Other 5s are0.\n\nIn the test input, according to this pattern, the output would have 1s in column3 and 2s in column1.\n\nBut let's verify this with the test input's row8: input is [0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0]. The 5s are at1,3,5,7. So output would have 2 at1 (right_col), 1 at3 (left_col), and 0s elsewhere.\n\nSo output row8: [0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nSimilarly, row4:5s at3,5,7. Output would be [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nThis seems to fit the pattern observed in the training examples.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should replace all 5s in column3 (left_col) with1, 5s in column1 (right_col) with2, and others with0.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input numbers (which are mostly 0s and some 5s) get transformed into the output numbers (0s, 1s, and 2s).\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has rows with 5s in certain positions. The output has 1s in the same positions where 5s start to appear, and then 2s in the last row's last element. Wait, looking closer:\n\nIn the input of Example 0, the first row is all zeros. The output is the same. The second row has a 5 at position 2 (third element). The output has a 1 there. Then in the third input row, there are two 5s at positions 2 and 6. The output has 1s at those positions? Wait no, in the output for Example 0's third row, the output is [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, so only the first occurrence of 5 in the column becomes 1, and maybe later ones become 2?\n\nWait, let's look at the output for Example 0. The output rows have 1s where the first occurrence of 5 in each column is, perhaps. Then, in the last few rows, the last column (position 8) has 2s. Let's check the input for that. The last three rows of the input have a 5 in position 8. So in the output, those become 2s. So maybe the first time a 5 appears in a column, it's 1, and subsequent times in the same column are 0, except maybe if it's a different row? Wait, maybe the pattern is that in each column, the first occurrence (from top to bottom) of 5 is replaced by 1. Then, if there's a 5 in that column below the first one, maybe they stay 0. But in Example 0's output, in the rows after the first occurrence, the 5s are replaced by 0 except for the last column. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput row 1 (second row) has a 5 in position 2. Output row 1 has 1 there. Then input row 2 has 5s in positions 2 and 6. Output row 2 has 1 in position 2, but 0 in position 6. So why is that? Because the first occurrence in column 2 is row 1, so in row 2, column 2 is 5 again, but in output it's 1 again. Wait, no, output row 2 has [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So column 2 in output has 1 in rows 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8? Let me check the input columns.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is indicating the first time a 5 appears in each column. But in Example 0, column 2 (third position) has 5s starting from row 1 and continues all the way down. The output for column 2 has 1s in all those rows. So that can't be. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the output for Example 0. The outputs have 1s in column 2 (third element) for all rows where there's a 5 in the input except for the first row. Wait, no. Let's list the input and output for column 2:\n\nInput column 2 (third element of each row):\n\nRow 0: 0\n\nRow 1:5\n\nRow2:5\n\nRow3:5\n\nRow4:5\n\nRow5:5\n\nRow6:5\n\nRow7:5\n\nRow8:5\n\nOutput column 2:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:1\n\nRow7:1\n\nRow8:1\n\nSo for column 2, every time there's a 5, it's replaced by 1. But then, in the output, other columns have different behavior. For example, column 6 (7th position) in Example 0 input starts at row2 with a 5. In output row2, column6 is 0. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, column6 (index 6) has 5s starting from row2. Let's check the output for column6:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0 (input has 5 here, output is 0)\n\nRow3:5 in input, output is 0.\n\nSimilarly, column8 in input starts having 5s from row6 onwards, and in the output, those are 2s. So for column8, the first occurrence is row6, which in output becomes 2. But in row7 and 8, they also become 2. So why is that?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output for column8:\n\nRows 6,7,8 have 2s. So maybe if a column's first 5 is in a certain row, then all 5s in that column below are replaced with 2. But in column2, all 5s are replaced with 1, even the first occurrence.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is: For each column, if there is at least one 5 in that column, then the first occurrence of 5 is replaced by 1. If the column has 5s in consecutive rows from the first occurrence down to the bottom, then any 5s after the first are replaced by 0, except for the last occurrence in the column. Or maybe it's the first and last occurrences?\n\nWait, looking at Example 1. Let's take column4 (index4). The input has 5s in all rows except row0. The output for column4 is 1 in all those rows except the last two. Wait, no. In Example1's input, column4 (5th element) has 5s from row0 and row1. Wait, no:\n\nLooking at Example1's input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow1: same as row0.\n\nRow2:5 in first position, but column4 (index4) is 5.\n\nRow3: same column4 is5.\n\nSo all rows from 0 to 8 in column4 have 5s. But the output for column4 is all 1s except rows7 and8? Wait, no. The output for Example1 is:\n\n[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo column4 (index4) in output is 1 in all rows except rows7 and8, but in those rows, the 1 remains. Wait, no, rows7 and8 of column4 in output are still 1. Because in row7 and8 of the input, column4 is5, and output is1. So the 5 in column4 is always 1 in output. So that's different from Example0's column8.\n\nIn Example0's column8, first 5 is in row6, output is2, and subsequent rows (7 and8) also have 2. So why is column8 in Example0 different?\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that in each column, the first occurrence of 5 is replaced by 1, except if the column has 5s all the way to the bottom, then the first occurrence is 1, and the last occurrence is 2. Or maybe the first and last occurrence in a column.\n\nIn Example0's column8: the 5s start at row6 and continue to row8. So first occurrence is row6. Output is2. Then rows7 and8 also have 2. So maybe for columns where 5s start from some row and go all the way to the bottom, the first occurrence is 2, and the rest are 2 as well. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number depends on how many \"blocks\" of 5s there are in the column. For example, if a column has a single continuous block of 5s starting from some row down to the bottom, then the first occurrence is replaced by 1, and the last occurrence (if it's the bottom) is replaced by 2. Wait, but in Example0's column8, the first occurrence is row6, and the last is row8, which is the bottom. So in the output, row6 is2, rows7 and8 are2. But why not 1 and then 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 5s in the column. If the column has all 5s from some point to the end, then the first occurrence is replaced by 1, and the last occurrence (the bottom) by 2. But how does that fit?\n\nIn Example0's column2, all rows from1 to8 have 5s. But the output is all 1s. So that contradicts the idea. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 1 for the first 5 in the column and 2 for the last 5 in the column. But in Example0's column2, the first 5 is row1, last is row8, but all are 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 1 for the first occurrence of a 5 in a column, and 2 for any 5 that is in a row that's the same as the previous row's 5. Wait, not sure.\n\nLet's look at Example1. In the input, column2 (third element) has 5s starting at row7 and 8. The output has 2s there. So why 2s? Maybe because those 5s are the first in their column but in a different context. Wait, in Example1's column2, the first 5 is in row7 and 8. So the output is 2. So perhaps when a column's 5 starts at a certain row and continues to the bottom, the first occurrence is 2. But why in Example0's column8, the first occurrence is row6, and it's 2. But in Example1's column4, which has 5s all the way from row0 to row8, the output is all 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs, each output row has at most one 1 and possibly a 2. For example, in Example0's output, each row has a 1 in column2 and a 2 in column8 in the last three rows. So maybe each row's 1 and 2 correspond to certain positions where the input 5s are.\n\nAnother idea: the 1s and 2s in the output correspond to the leftmost and rightmost 5s in each row. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's input row6: [5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5]. The leftmost 5 is position0, rightmost is8. But the output is [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2]. So in the output, position2 is1, position8 is2. Hmm, that doesn't match the leftmost and rightmost.\n\nWait, in the output, for row6, position2 is1 and position8 is2. In the input row6, positions0,2,4,6,8 are5. So maybe it's not leftmost and rightmost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are in the earliest column (leftmost) where a 5 appears in that row, and the 2s are in the latest (rightmost). Let's check:\n\nIn Example0's input row6: columns0,2,4,6,8 have5. The earliest is0, but the output has1 in column2. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the 1s and 2s are counting the number of 5s in certain positions. For example, 1 represents a single 5 in the column, and 2 represents multiple 5s. But in Example0's column8, there are three 5s (rows6-8) and they are all 2s. But in column2, there are eight 5s (rows1-8), but all are 1s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the row's position relative to the first and last occurrence of 5 in each column. For example, if a cell is the first occurrence in its column, it's 1; if it's the last occurrence, it's 2; otherwise 0. Let's test that.\n\nIn Example0's column2: first occurrence is row1, last is row8. So any cell in column2 from row1 to8 would be 1 if it's the first, 0 otherwise. But the output for column2 has all 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the first occurrence of 5 in the entire grid (not per column) is 1, and the last occurrence is 2. But in Example0's input, the first 5 is in row1, column2, and the last 5 is row8, column8. But the output has 1s and 2s in other places.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 5 in the input is replaced with a number that increments each time it appears in a certain way. For example, the first 5 in the entire grid (row1, column2) becomes 1, then the next 5s become 2, etc. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nLet me try another angle. Let's compare each input and output row for the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example0's input and output rows:\n\nInput row1: [0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 Output row1: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nInput row2: [0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0] \u2192 Output row2: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the second 5 in row2 (column6) becomes 0. So why?\n\nIn the output, only the first 5 in the row becomes 1, and others become 0, unless there's a 2. But in row6 of Example0's output, there's a 1 in column2 and a 2 in column8. So maybe there's a rule that if a row has multiple 5s, the leftmost is 1 and the rightmost is 2. Let's check:\n\nIn row6 of Example0's input, the 5s are at 0,2,4,6,8. The leftmost is0, but output has1 at2 and 2 at8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the leftmost 5 in the row that is part of a vertical sequence (continuous in the column) becomes 1, and the rightmost such 5 becomes 2. Let's see.\n\nIn Example0's column2: all rows from1 to8 have 5. So it's a vertical block from row1 to8. The first in this block (row1) is1, and the rest in the column are1? But that's not the case. Wait, in the output, all rows from1 to8 have1 in column2. So maybe any 5 that is part of a vertical block (connected) is marked as1. But then why in column8, which starts at row6, the output is2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are for 5s that are the first in their respective columns, and 2s are for 5s that are the first in their columns and also the first in their rows. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at Example1's output. The output has 2s in column2 (third element) in rows7 and8. Let's check the input for those rows. In row7 and8, column2 has 5s. But in the input, column2's first occurrence is in row7. So why is that a 2 instead of a1? Because in Example1's output, column2's first occurrence is row7, which is mapped to 2.\n\nSo maybe there's a different rule here. Let's think of the output as follows: in each row, replace each 5 with a number that depends on its position in the column. For example, the first 5 in the column is replaced with1, and the last 5 in the column (if it's not the first) is replaced with2. All others are0. Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's column8:\n\nFirst 5 is row6, last is row8. So row6 would be1, rows7 and8 would be0. But in the output, all three are2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first occurrence of 5 in a column is1, and if the column's 5s start from that first occurrence and continue to the bottom, then the last occurrence (the bottom one) is2. So in column8 of Example0, first is row6, and last is row8. So row6 is1, row8 is2, and row7 is0? But in output, all three are2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe any 5 that is the first in the column is1, and any 5 that is the first in the row (leftmost) is1, and the rightmost 5 in the row is2, but that seems complicated.\n\nWait, looking at Example1's input row7 and8. Input row7: [5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,0]. Output row7: [0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0]. The 5s are in columns0,2,4,6. The output has 2 in column2 and1 in4. So why column4 here is1? Because in column4, the first 5 is in row0. So every time there's a 5 in column4, it's replaced by1. But why in row7, column2's 5 is replaced by2. Because in column2, the first 5 is row7. So maybe first occurrence in column is1, but here it's2. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm, maybe the pattern is that the output 1s are in the same positions as the 5s in the first row that has a 5 in each column. For any subsequent 5s in the same column, they are replaced with 0 unless they are the last in the column (bottom row), which is replaced with2. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example0, column2: the first 5 is in row1. So all rows from1 to8 in column2 would have1. But the output has1 in all those rows, which matches. For column6 in Example0: first5 is row2. So row2 would have1, but in output row2, column6 is0. So this doesn't fit. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAnother idea: The output counts the number of times a 5 has appeared in the same column up to that row. So, for each cell, if it's a5, look at how many 5s are in that column from the top down to that row. If it's the first, output1; if it's the second, output2; etc. But in Example0's column2, all the 5s would be counted as1, which fits the output. In column8 of Example0, each 5 in rows6-8 would be 1, 2, 3. But the output is2 in all. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the count of the number of times the column has a5 up to and including the current row. So for column2 in Example0, every row after row1 would have1, but the output shows all 1s, which would match. For column8, row6 is1, row7 is2, row8 is3. But the output is2 in all three. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Maybe the output is indicating the number of 5s in the same row, but that's not the case. For example, in Example0's row6 input has five 5s, output has two non-zero elements (1 and2). So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, the non-zero elements are always 1 and 2. In each row, there's at most one 1 and one 2. So perhaps each row has one 1 and possibly one 2.\n\nIn Example0's output, rows6-8 have a1 and a2. For example, row6 has1 in column2 and2 in column8.\n\nIn Example1's output, rows7 and8 have2 in column2 and1 in column4.\n\nSo maybe the 1 and2 represent the first and last occurrence of 5 in the row. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0's row6 input: 5s at positions0,2,4,6,8. The first is0, last is8. Output has1 at2 and2 at8. Doesn't match.\n\nIn Example1's row7 input: 5s at0,2,4,6. First is0, last is6. Output has2 at2 and1 at4. Doesn't match.\n\nSo that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for vertical and horizontal patterns. Perhaps the output is marking the highest 5 in each column as1, and the lowest as2. For example, in column2 of Example0, the highest is row1, so all rows in column2 are1. The lowest is row8, which would be2. But the output for column2 is all1. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are the highest occurrence of a5 in the column, and the 2s are the lowest. But in Example0's column8, the highest is row6 and lowest is row8, which in output are both2. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that each 5 in the input is replaced by 1 if it's the first in its row, and 2 if it's the last in its row. But in Example0's row6, the first 5 is at position0, but the output has1 at position2. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is transforming each 5 into a value based on how many columns to the left and right have 5s in the same row. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is creating a path. For example, the 1s and2s form a path from the top to the bottom. Looking at Example0's output, the1 in column2 is present in all rows, which would form a vertical line. Then, in the last three rows, there's a2 in column8. But how does that form a path?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s represent the main vertical line and 2s are branches. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input represent a structure like a tree, and the output is numbering nodes. But that's too vague.\n\nWait, looking at Example1's output. The 1s are in column4 (position4) for most rows, and then in rows7 and8, column2 (position2) becomes2. So maybe the 1s are in a column where all rows have 5s starting from the top, and 2s are in columns where the 5s start later.\n\nWait, in Example1's column4, the input has 5s from row0 to row8. The output has 1s in all those rows. But column2's 5s start at row7 and8. Output has2 in those positions. So perhaps, if a column has 5s starting from the top (earlier rows), it's 1. If the column has 5s starting later, it's2. But in Example0's column8, the 5s start at row6, which is not the top, so it's2. But in Example0's column2, the 5s start at row1 (not the top row0), but they are all1. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is the number of steps down from the first occurrence in the column. For example, first occurrence is1, then each subsequent is incremented. But in Example0's column2, all are1. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is1 for the first occurrence in the column and2 for the first occurrence in the row. But in Example0's row6, the first occurrence in the row is position0, but output has1 at position2.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of the output as a binary matrix with two types of markers: 1 and2. The 1s are in certain columns and rows, and 2s in others. What's common between the 1s and 2s across the examples.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for columns in the output that have 1s and/or 2s.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\nColumns with 1s: column2 (all rows from1 to8), and column8 (rows6-8 are2).\n\nIn the input, column2 has 5s from row1 onward, and column8 has5s from row6 onward.\n\nIn the output, column2 is all1s except row0. Column8 is2s in rows6-8.\n\nIn Example1's output:\n\nColumns with 1s: column4 (all rows0-8, except rows7-8 have1 as well?), and column2 (rows7-8 have2).\n\nIn the input, column4 has5s from row0 onward. Column2 has5s starting at row7 and8.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is:\n\nFor each column in the input:\n\n- If the column has a 5 in the first row (row0), then all 5s in that column are replaced with1.\n\n- If the column's first 5 is not in row0, then replace the first occurrence with1 and the rest with0, unless the column's 5s start from some row and continue to the bottom, in which case the first is1 and the last is2.\n\nWait, in Example0's column8, the first5 is row6. Since it's not in row0, but the 5s continue to the bottom (rows6-8), so first is row6 (1), last is row8 (2). So the output would have1 in row6 and2 in row8, but rows7 would be0. But in the output, rows6-8 have2. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if a column's 5s start from a certain row and continue to the bottom, then the first occurrence is1 and all subsequent are2. So for column8 in Example0: row6 is1, rows7 and8 are2. But in the output, all three are2. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is such that the first time a column has a5 in any row, it's1. Then, for any subsequent rows in that column, if there's a5, it's2. But in Example0's column2, the first occurrence is row1 (1), and the rest would be2. But output has all1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is generated by looking at each row and marking the earliest column with a5 that hasn't been marked before in previous rows. For example, the first time a5 appears in a column, it's1. Subsequent appearances in the same column are2. Let's test this.\n\nExample0:\n\nRow1: column2 is first time, so1.\n\nRow2: column2 is already marked, but column6 is new. So row2's column6 would be1. But in output, row2's column6 is0. So no.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, each column can be marked once. The first time any column appears with a5 in the entire grid, it's1. Later rows in that column are2. But in Example0's column2, all rows after row1 would be2, but output has1s. So no.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to look for another pattern. Let's compare the input and output for each example.\n\nExample0:\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: all zeros \u2192 output same.\n\nRow1: 5 at column2 \u2192 output1 there.\n\nRow2:5 at column2 and6 \u2192 output1 at column2, others 0.\n\nRow3:5 at0,2,6 \u2192 output1 at2.\n\nRow4: same as row3 \u2192 output same.\n\nRow5:5 at0,2,4,6 \u2192 output1 at2.\n\nRow6:5 at0,2,4,6,8 \u2192 output1 at2, 2 at8.\n\nRow7: same as row6 \u2192 output1 at2, 2 at8.\n\nRow8: same \u2192 output same.\n\nSo the output in each row only has 1 at column2, except when there's a new 5 in the rightmost position (column8) starting from row6, which is marked as2.\n\nSimilarly, in Example1:\n\nInput has 5s in column4 starting from row0, and others.\n\nOutput in column4 is1 for all rows, except rows7 and8 have2 in column2.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that for each row, the leftmost 5 in the lowest possible column (or highest index?) is marked as2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in Example0, column2 is the earliest column (leftmost) that has 5s. So all those are marked as1. Then, in later rows, a new column (column8) appears, which is the rightmost, so marked as2.\n\nIn Example1, column4 is the leftmost column with 5s (since it starts at row0), so marked as1. Then, in later rows, column2 (which is to the left of column4) starts having5s. But output in column2 is2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Another approach: perhaps the output is the binary representation of the columns, where 1 represents a column that has a 5 in the current row and also in the previous row, and 2 represents a column that has a 5 in the current row but not in the previous row. Or something like that.\n\nFor example, in Example0's row1, column2 has5. Since previous row (row0) doesn't have a5, it's 2. But output is1. So no.\n\nAlternatively, 1 represents a column that has a5 in the current row and the column is \"active\" (like part of a vertical block), and 2 represents a new isolated 5. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is counting the number of continuous vertical 5s in each column. For example, each time a5 is part of a vertical streak, it's1, and if it's the start of a new vertical streak, it's2. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output may represent the height of the 5s in each column. For example, the number of 5s in each column up to that row. But in Example0's column2, the count would be row1:1, row2:2, etc., but output is all1s.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let me try to look for any other possible pattern.\n\nLooking at Example0's output:\n\nThe 1s are in column2 for rows1-8, and 2s in column8 for rows6-8.\n\nIn the input, column2's 5s start from row1 and continue down. Column8's 5s start at row6 and continue down. So maybe the output is marking columns where the 5s form a continuous block from their first occurrence to the bottom. If a column's 5s start at row N and go to the bottom (row8), then the output for that column is 1 in the first occurrence and 2 in all subsequent rows. Wait, in column8 of Example0, first is row6. Output has2 in row6,7,8. So perhaps when a column's 5s start at any row and continue to the bottom, all 5s in that column are replaced with2. But then why column2 in Example0 is all1s. Because in column2, the 5s start at row1 and continue to the bottom. But output is1s. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if a column's 5s start from row0, then they are1, else they are2. But column2 in Example0 starts from row1, but output is1. So that's not it.\n\nMaybe the output is determined by the row index. For example, if the row number is even, 5s become1; if odd, 2. But that's not matching the examples.\n\nAnother thought: The output may be the result of some kind of cellular automaton where each cell looks at its neighbors. But given the examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of two patterns: one for the leftmost column with 5s and another for the rightmost.\n\nIn Example0's input, the leftmost 5 in each row is column0 in rows3-8, but the output's leftmost 1 is column2. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is marking the first occurrence of a5 in the entire grid (column2 in Example0) as1, and any new columns that start appearing later (like column8 in Example0) as2. So, in Example0, column2 is the first column with 5s, so all its 5s are1. Later columns that have 5s (like column6, 4, etc.) are ignored except for the last column (column8), which is marked as2. But in Example0's input, column6 has5s starting from row2, but the output doesn't mark them. So this theory doesn't hold.\n\nIn Example1, the first column with 5s is column4 (rows0 and1), and then column0 in row2. The output for column4 is all1s. Later, column2 starts having5s in rows7 and8, which are marked as2.\n\nSo perhaps the first column to have a5 (earliest column) is marked with1s, and later columns (those that appear later in the grid) are marked with2s when their 5s appear.\n\nBut how to determine the order of columns appearing? In Example0, the first column with a5 is column2 (row1), then column0 (row3), column6 (row2), column4 (row5), column8 (row6). The output marks column2 as1 and column8 as2. Other columns like0,4,6 have5s but output is0. So perhaps the first and last columns to have 5s are marked as1 and2 respectively. In Example0, column2 is first and column8 is last. In Example1, column4 is first and column2 is last. So in Example1's output, column4 is1 and column2 is2.\n\nThat seems to fit the examples. Let's check:\n\nExample0: columns with5s are0,2,4,6,8. First column to have a5 is2 (row1). Last column to have a5 added is8 (row6). So in output, column2 is1 wherever it has5, and column8 is2 wherever it has5. Other columns'5s are0.\n\nIn Example0's output:\n\n- Column2 has1 in all rows where there's a5 (rows1-8).\n\n- Column8 has2 in rows6-8.\n\n- Other columns (0,4,6) have5s in input but are0 in output.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nColumns with5s are0,4,6,2. First column is4 (row0). Last column is2 (rows7-8). So output column4 is1 wherever it has5, and column2 is2 in rows7-8.\n\nIn Example1's output:\n\n- Column4 has1 in all rows where there's a5 (rows0-8).\n\n- Column2 has2 in rows7-8.\n\nOther columns (0,6) have5s but output is0.\n\nSo this pattern seems to fit. The rule would be: identify the earliest column (smallest index) where a5 appears first in the grid, and the latest column (largest index) where a5 appears last in the grid. Then, in the output, replace all 5s in the earliest column with1 and all 5s in the latest column with2. All other5s are replaced with0.\n\nLet's verify this with the examples.\n\nFor Example0:\n\nThe earliest column with a5 is column2 (appears first in row1). The latest column is8 (appears first in row6). So in output:\n\n- Every5 in column2 becomes1.\n\n- Every5 in column8 becomes2.\n\n- Other5s become0.\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nFor Example1:\n\nThe earliest column is4 (appears in row0). The latest column is2 (appears in row7). So in output:\n\n- Every5 in column4 becomes1.\n\n- Every5 in column2 becomes2.\n\nOther5s become0. Which matches Example1's output.\n\nSo the pattern is: find the earliest column (smallest index) where the first 5 appears in the grid (earliest row), and the latest column (largest index) where the first 5 appears in the grid. Replace all 5s in the earliest column with1, 5s in the latest column with2, and all others with0.\n\nWait, but in Example1, the latest column is2, which is not the largest index. Because column4 has index4, which is larger than2. But column2 is the latest column to have its first5 appear. So maybe the latest column is the one whose first occurrence of5 is the latest in the grid.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nFor each column, note the first row where a5 appears. The earliest column is the one with the smallest index that has the earliest first occurrence. If there's a tie in the earliest row, the column with the smallest index is chosen.\n\nThe latest column is the one with the largest index that has the earliest first occurrence. Wait, no. Maybe the latest column is the one with the largest index among all columns that have a5, and their first occurrence is after other columns.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let's re-express the steps:\n\n1. For each column in the input grid, determine the first row (earliest row) where a5 appears. If a column has no5s, ignore it.\n\n2. Among all columns that have at least one5, find the column with the smallest index that has the earliest first occurrence of5. This column's5s are replaced with1.\n\n3. Among all columns that have at least one5, find the column with the largest index that has the latest first occurrence of5. This column's5s are replaced with2.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample0:\n\nColumns with5s:0,2,4,6,8.\n\nFirst occurrences:\n\n- Column0: row3.\n\n- Column2: row1.\n\n- Column4: row5.\n\n- Column6: row2.\n\n- Column8: row6.\n\nEarliest column is column2 (first5 at row1), which is the earliest. So replace all its5s with1.\n\nLatest first occurrence: the latest column to have its first5 is column8 (row6). So replace all its5s with2.\n\nOther columns are0.\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nExample1:\n\nColumns with5s:0,4,6,2.\n\nFirst occurrences:\n\n- Column0: row2.\n\n- Column4: row0.\n\n- Column6: row3.\n\n- Column2: row7.\n\nEarliest column is column4 (row0). Replace all5s with1.\n\nLatest first occurrence is column2 (row7). So replace all5s in column2 with2.\n\nOther columns are0. Which matches the output.\n\nYes, this fits. So the pattern is:\n\nFor the entire grid:\n\n- Find all columns that have at least one5.\n\n- For each such column, find the first row where the5 appears.\n\n- The earliest column (smallest index) with the earliest first row is chosen. All5s in that column are replaced with1.\n\n- The latest column (largest index) with the latest first row (i.e., the column whose first5 appears furthest down) is chosen. All5s in that column are replaced with2.\n\n- All other5s are replaced with0.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\nRows:\n\n0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\n2: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0]\n\n3: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0]\n\n4: [0,0,0,5,0,5,0,5,0]\n\n5: [0,0,0,5,0,5,0,5,0]\n\n6: [0,0,0,5,0,5,0,5,0]\n\n7: [0,0,0,5,0,5,0,5,0]\n\n8: [0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0]\n\nFirst, identify all columns with at least one5.\n\nColumns3,5,7, and column1 (row8 has5 in column1).\n\nWait, let's list all columns (indices0-8):\n\nColumn0: only row8 has5? No, row8 is [0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0], which is column1,3,5,7. So column0 is all0 except row8 has0.\n\nWait, let's re-express the test input row by row, with columns 0 to8:\n\nRow0: all zeros.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0] \u2192 column7 has5.\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0] \u2192 columns3 and7.\n\nRow3: same as row2.\n\nRow4: columns3,5,7.\n\nRow5: same as row4.\n\nRow6: same.\n\nRow7: same.\n\nRow8: columns1,3,5,7.\n\nSo columns with5s are1,3,5,7.\n\nNow find the first occurrence of5 in each:\n\nColumn1: first5 at row8.\n\nColumn3: first5 at row1? Wait row1 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0]. Column3 is index3, which is0. So column3's first5 is row2. Because row2 has5 in column3.\n\nWait, let's go step by step:\n\nFor each column:\n\nColumn0: no5s.\n\nColumn1: first5 in row8.\n\nColumn2: no5s.\n\nColumn3: first5 in row2.\n\nColumn4: no5s.\n\nColumn5: first5 in row4.\n\nColumn6: no5s.\n\nColumn7: first5 in row1.\n\nColumn8: no5s.\n\nSo the columns with5s and their first occurrences:\n\n- Column1: row8.\n\n- Column3: row2.\n\n- Column5: row4.\n\n- Column7: row1.\n\nNow, among these columns, which is the earliest column (smallest index) with the earliest first row?\n\nThe earliest columns are column1 (index1), column3 (index3), column5 (index5), column7 (index7).\n\nThe earliest first row is column7 (row1), then column3 (row2), column5 (row4), column1 (row8).\n\nSo the earliest column with the earliest first occurrence is column7 (since it has the earliest first row (row1), and its index is7. But wait, the rule was:\n\nThe earliest column is the smallest index among those with the earliest first row.\n\nWait, the earliest first row is row1 (column7). Are there any other columns with first occurrence in row1? Only column7. So the earliest column with earliest first row is column7. But column7's index is7, which is the largest among the columns with5s. So that's conflicting with the previous examples.\n\nWait, no. The earliest column is determined by the smallest index, but first occurrence row. So for example, if two columns have first occurrence in the same row, the one with smaller index is chosen.\n\nIn the test case:\n\nColumns with first occurrences:\n\n- column7: row1.\n\n- column3: row2.\n\n- column5: row4.\n\n- column1: row8.\n\nSo the earliest first occurrence is row1 (column7). So column7 is the earliest column with the earliest first occurrence. So all5s in column7 would be replaced with1.\n\nThe latest column with the latest first occurrence is column1 (row8, which is the latest first occurrence), and it's the largest index among columns with5s? Wait, columns with5s are1,3,5,7. The largest index is7 (column7), but column7's first occurrence is row1. The latest first occurrence is column1 (row8). Among the columns with the latest first occurrence (row8), the largest index is1, but column1's index is1, which is the smallest. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nThe latest first occurrence is row8 (column1). Among columns that have first occurrence in row8, only column1. So the latest column (largest index) among those with latest first occurrence is column1. So all5s in column1 would be replaced with2.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nIn every row where there's a5 in column7 (rows1-8 except row0 and row8?), wait:\n\nLet's check column7's 5s:\n\nRows1-7: column7 has5 in rows1,2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nRow8: column7 has5.\n\nSo all rows from1 to8, column7 has5 except row0.\n\nSo in the output, all these 5s would become1.\n\nThe latest column is column1, whose first occurrence is row8. So in row8's column1, the5 would become2. Other occurrences in column1 (only row8) would be2.\n\nOther columns (3,5) would have their5s replaced with0.\n\nSo the output for each row would be:\n\nRow0: all0.\n\nRow1: column7 is1.\n\nRow2: column7 is1 and column3 is0.\n\nRow3: same as row2.\n\nRow4: column7 is1, column3 and5 are0.\n\nRow5: same as row4.\n\nRow6: same.\n\nRow7: same.\n\nRow8: column1 is2, column3,5,7 are0.\n\nBut wait, let's apply this:\n\nFor each row:\n\nReplace all5s in column7 with1.\n\nReplace all5s in column1 with2.\n\nOthers are0.\n\nBut column3,5,7: column7's5s are replaced with1. Column1's5s (only in row8) are2. Columns3 and5's5s are0.\n\nSo the output rows would be:\n\nRow0: all0.\n\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nRow3: same as row2.\n\nRow4: same as row2 (since column3 and5 are0).\n\nWait, but row4's input has5s in columns3,5,7. So output would have1 in column7, others0.\n\nYes.\n\nRow5: same.\n\nRow6: same.\n\nRow7: same.\n\nRow8: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nWait, but row8's input has5s in columns1,3,5,7. According to the pattern, column7 becomes1, column1 becomes2, others0.\n\nSo row8's output would be [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0].\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs have a single1 and a possible2. For example, in Example0's output, row6 has1 and2. So the test output should have1 in column7 and2 in column1 for row8.\n\nBut according to the pattern, the output for row8 would have2 in column1 and1 in column7. So the row8 output would be [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0].\n\nSo the final output would look like:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\n[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n\nBut let's check if this matches the pattern. According to the training examples, the earliest column (smallest index) with earliest first5 is chosen. In the test case, the earliest first5 is column7 (row1). So all5s in column7 become1. The latest column with latest first5 is column1 (row8). So its5 becomes2. All other5s in columns3 and5 become0.\n\nThis seems correct. So the output should be as above.",
