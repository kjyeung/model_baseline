        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a grid of numbers (mostly 0s, some 8s and 2s), and the output seems to modify these grids in some way. Let's start by analyzing the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has a row with all 8s (sixth row) and a couple of 2s in the third and tenth rows. The output adds more 2s and 8s in a certain pattern. For instance, around the 2 in row 2, there are now 2s in rows 3 and 4 of the same column. Also, the row of 8s now has some 2s in the middle, and there's a horizontal line of 8s in row 5 and 7. So maybe the 2s are being propagated downward or creating some vertical lines, and the 8s are expanding into a cross or diamond shape?\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has columns of 8s at positions 3 and 14. The output creates a diamond-like structure around the 2 in the middle. The row with the 2 (row 4) now has a lot of 2s between the 8s. Also, the 8 columns expand into a diamond pattern around them. So perhaps when there's a 2 in a row that's adjacent to 8s, it spreads 2s horizontally or vertically, and the 8s form a diamond shape?\n\nIn Example 2, the input has two rows of 8s. The output adds 2s in vertical lines where there were 2s in the input and creates diamond patterns around the 8 rows. The 8 rows in the output have 2s in the middle, and surrounding 8s form a cross or diamond. So maybe the 8s are turning into a diamond pattern where each 8 in the input row becomes the center of a cross of 8s, and any 2s near them influence the pattern?\n\nPutting this together, here's what I think happens:\n\n1. For rows that are entirely 8s (like a solid line), in the output, each 8 in that row becomes the center of a cross (horizontal and vertical 8s) but with possible 2s in the middle. Also, the rows above and below might get some 8s forming a diamond shape.\n\n2. The 2s in the input seem to create vertical lines of 2s downward. For example, in Example 0, the 2 in row 2 column 2 creates 2s in the same column in the next two rows. Similarly, the 2 in row 10 column 8 creates a vertical line in the output.\n\n3. When there's a 2 near 8s, like in Example 1's row 4, the 2s spread horizontally between the 8 columns, and the 8s form a diamond around them.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nThe test input has several rows with 8s in column 4 and 12. Also, there are a couple of 2s in rows 1 (column 15), row 2 (column 1), row 8 (column 8), and row 14 (column 16). \n\nFirst, the rows with 8s at positions 4 and 12. These might form diamond patterns. For example, each 8 in those columns should create a cross around them. Also, any 2s near these 8s would spread. \n\nLooking at row 8, which has a 2 at column 8. This might cause a vertical line of 2s below or above. Also, since there are 8s in columns 4 and 12 in that row, perhaps the 8s form a diamond around them, inserting 2s in between.\n\nAnother 2 is in row 1, column 15. So that might create a vertical line of 2s downward from there.\n\nSo the output should have vertical lines of 2s where the input 2s are, and the 8s in columns 4 and 12 would form diamond patterns with crosses of 8s and possibly 2s in between.\n\nFor example, in the rows where there's an 8 in column 4 and 12, like row 0, maybe around those positions, the output has 8s forming a diamond. Also, the 2s in the input would have vertical lines of 2s below them.\n\nLooking at the test input's row 1: there's a 2 at column 15. So in the output, rows 1, 2, 3, etc., in column 15 would have 2s. Similarly, row 8's 2 at column 8 would create a vertical line. The 2 in row 14, column 16 might also create a vertical line upwards or downwards.\n\nAdditionally, the 8s in columns 4 and 12 in each row would form a diamond pattern. For instance, each 8 in those columns would have 8s above, below, left, and right, but maybe only if they are in a solid line. Wait, in the training examples, the rows that are entirely 8s turn into a cross with 2s in the middle. So perhaps in the test input, the 8s in columns 4 and 12 (which are in multiple rows) would form crosses. But since they are not contiguous rows of 8s, maybe the pattern is different. Wait, the test input has 8s in columns 4 and 12 in multiple rows, but each row has 8s only in those two columns. So maybe each of those 8s becomes the center of a diamond or cross.\n\nBut looking back at Example 1, the 8 columns are at 3 and 14, and the output creates a diamond pattern around them. So maybe when there's an 8 in a column, but not the entire row, the diamond forms around each 8. But in Example 1, the output had a horizontal spread of 8s between the two columns. So in the test case, each 8 in columns 4 and 12 would form a diamond, and the 2s would form vertical lines.\n\nPutting all this together, the output would have vertical 2 lines under each input 2. The 8s in columns 4 and 12 would form diamond patterns. Also, between the 8s in columns 4 and 12, there might be 2s when there's a 2 in that row. For example, in row 1, there's a 2 at column 15. So maybe that's separate. But in rows where a 2 is between the two 8 columns, like row 8, the 2 could form a horizontal line between the 8s.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to see the exact rules.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has a row of all 8s. The output turns that row into 8s with 2s in the middle. The row above and below that have 8s arranged in a horizontal line. So maybe for any row that's entirely 8s, it's transformed into a cross: the original row has 8s with 2s in certain positions, and the adjacent rows have horizontal lines of 8s, creating a diamond shape.\n\nBut in the test input, there's no entire row of 8s. Instead, there are columns with 8s in multiple rows. So maybe each 8 in the input is the center of a cross (horizontal and vertical 8s) in the output. But in Example 1, the 8 columns (3 and 14) in the input have the output creating a diamond pattern around them. So when there's a vertical line of 8s (like columns 3 and 14 in Example 1), then in the output, those columns expand into a diamond shape with 8s and 2s.\n\nIn the test input, the 8s are in columns 4 and 12 across multiple rows, but not the entire column. For example, every row has 8s in columns 4 and 12. Wait, looking at the test input's first row: [0,0,0,0,8,0,...8,0...]. So columns 4 and 12 have 8s in all rows. So perhaps these are vertical lines of 8s. So for each vertical line of 8s, the output would create a diamond pattern around them. Also, any 2s near these 8s would be part of that pattern.\n\nAdditionally, each 2 in the input creates a vertical line of 2s downward. For example, in Example 0, the 2 in row 2, column 2 leads to 2s in the same column in rows 3 and 4. Similarly, in the test input, the 2 in row 1, column 15 would create 2s in rows 2, 3, etc., in column 15. But let's check the test input's rows. For example, row 1 has a 2 at column 15. So in the output, rows 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., column 15 would have 2s until another 8 or the end. But in the test input, row 1's 2 is at column 15, which is between the 8s at columns 4 and 12? Wait, columns 4 and 12 are positions in each row. Wait, the test input's first row has 8 at index 4 and 12 (assuming 0-based indexing). So columns 4 and 12 have 8s in all rows. So the vertical lines of 8s are columns 4 and 12. So in the output, these columns would form diamond patterns. The 2s in the input would create vertical lines. So row 8 has a 2 at column 8. That's between columns 4 and 12. So perhaps between those 8 columns, the 2s form horizontal lines.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, which has vertical 8 columns (3 and 14) and a 2 in row 4, column 8. The output creates a horizontal line of 2s between the 8 columns. So maybe when a 2 is between two vertical 8 columns, it creates a horizontal line of 2s. Similarly, in the test input, the 2s in row 8 (column 8) would create a horizontal line between columns 4 and 12.\n\nPutting this all together, the test output should:\n\n- For each vertical line of 8s (columns 4 and 12), create a diamond pattern. So around each 8 in these columns, there might be 8s in adjacent rows and columns, forming a diamond.\n\n- For 2s in the input, create vertical lines downward. But if the 2 is between the two vertical 8 columns, also create a horizontal line of 2s connecting the two 8 columns.\n\n- Additionally, in rows where there's a 2 between two 8 columns, the 2s spread horizontally between them.\n\nSo in the test input's row 8, column 8 has a 2. This is between columns 4 and 12. So in the output, that row would have 2s from column 4 to 12. But also, the vertical 8 columns would have diamond patterns around them. Similarly, the 2 in row 14, column 16 is outside the 8 columns, so maybe it just creates a vertical line downward.\n\nLet me try to sketch the output step by step.\n\nFirst, process the vertical 8 columns (4 and 12). For each 8 in these columns, create a cross (up, down, left, right) of 8s. Wait, but in Example 1, the 8 columns expanded into diamonds. For example, in the output of Example 1, the 8 columns at 3 and 14 in the input have the output rows 3 and 5 showing 8s forming a diamond. So when there's a vertical line of 8s (same column in multiple rows), the output creates a diamond pattern by adding 8s around them. For each 8 in the column, maybe add 8s in the adjacent rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, the diamond is formed by expanding each 8 into a 3x3 cross. For example, each 8 in the input is the center of a cross (up, down, left, right), but if multiple 8s are in a vertical line, this might form a diamond pattern when combined.\n\nAnother approach: For every 8 in the input, the output places an 8 in the same position, and also 8s to the left, right, above, and below. But if adjacent 8s would overlap, they form a larger structure. However, looking at the examples, this isn't exactly what happens. In Example 0, the entire row of 8s in input becomes a row with 8s and 2s, with adjacent rows having horizontal 8s. So perhaps it's more about the entire rows or columns of 8s, not individual 8s.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the input row 6 is all 8s. The output for that row is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], but with 2s inserted in positions 2 and 8. Wait, looking at the output example 0's sixth row (input was all 8s), the output row is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], but in positions 2 and 8 there are 2s. Wait, no: looking at the actual output for Example 0:\n\nThe output's sixth row is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8] (same as input). Wait no, wait the example 0's input sixth row is all 8s, and the output's sixth row is [8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. Oh, right! So the all-8s row in the input becomes a row where the third and ninth positions are 2s. Also, the rows above and below (rows 5 and 7) have 8s in a pattern like 0,8,8,8,0 etc. So maybe when there's a full row of 8s, the output replaces certain positions with 2s and adds adjacent rows with horizontal 8s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s in the output are generated based on the 2s in the input. For example, in Example 0's input, there are 2s in row 2 and 10. The output has vertical lines of 2s below them. So each 2 in the input creates a vertical line of 2s in the same column, continuing downward until they hit an 8 or the edge.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has a 2 in row 4, column 8. The output for that row has a horizontal line of 2s between columns 4 and 14 (which are the 8 columns). So maybe when a 2 is between two vertical 8 columns, it creates a horizontal line of 2s between them. Additionally, vertical lines of 2s below and above.\n\nPutting all this together, here's a possible set of rules:\n\n1. For every 2 in the input:\n   a. Create a vertical line of 2s downward from that position, stopping when another 2 or 8 is encountered or the end of the grid.\n   b. If the 2 is between two vertical 8 columns (like columns 4 and 12 in the test input), create a horizontal line of 2s between those columns in the same row.\n\n2. For every vertical line of 8 columns (like columns 4 and 12 in the test input):\n   a. In each row where there's an 8 in that column, create a horizontal line of 8s in that row, centered at the 8 column.\n   b. Additionally, create vertical lines of 8s above and below each 8 in the column to form a diamond pattern.\n\nWait, but how to determine which columns are considered vertical lines. In the test input, columns 4 and 12 have 8s in every row. So perhaps any column that has 8s in all rows is considered a vertical line, and those are the ones that generate the diamond patterns.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\n- Columns 4 and 12 are vertical lines of 8s. For each of these columns:\n   a. In each row, the 8 in column 4 would create a horizontal line of 8s in that row, spanning left and right. But in the examples, the horizontal lines are limited. For example, in Example 1, the horizontal lines are three 8s around each 8 in the column. So perhaps each 8 in the vertical column creates a horizontal line of three 8s (left, center, right) in its row. Similarly, vertical lines above and below. But how does this create a diamond?\n\nAlternatively, for each 8 in a vertical column, create a cross (left, right, above, below) of 8s, leading to a diamond when combined with adjacent rows.\n\nBut this needs to be checked against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the vertical 8 columns (3 and 14) have in row 4 a diamond pattern. The row 4 of the output is [0,0,8,2,8,2,...], indicating that between columns 3 and 14, there's a spread of 2s. But I'm getting stuck. Maybe the key is that whenever there's a vertical 8 column and a 2 in between them, the 2s spread horizontally between the 8 columns in that row. And for the vertical 8 columns themselves, they expand into diamonds by adding 8s around them.\n\nAlternatively, the 8 columns form a diamond by having each 8 in the column generate a 3x3 cross, and the 2s in between spread horizontally between the 8 columns.\n\nThis is getting a bit too vague. Let's look at the test input again.\n\nThe test input has 8s in columns 4 and 12 in every row. So each row has two 8s. For example, row 0: 8 at 4 and 12. Row 1: same, etc.\n\nIn the output, each of these 8s would generate some pattern. For instance, perhaps each 8 in column 4 would have 8s to the left, right, above, and below. But if they are in every row, this would create a solid block. However, in Example 1's input, the vertical 8 columns are not in every row, but in the output, they form a diamond. So maybe when a column has consecutive 8s, they form a diamond pattern.\n\nAlternatively, it's the horizontal line of 8s that trigger the diamond pattern, but the test input's 8s are in vertical columns.\n\nThis is tricky. Perhaps I should look for common transformations in the outputs:\n\n- 2s in the input create vertical lines of 2s downward.\n- 8s in a row create horizontal expansions into a diamond with 2s in the center.\n- Vertical columns of 8s expand into vertical diamonds.\n\nAlternatively, whenever there's a 2 in a row that has 8s, the 2s spread between the 8s.\n\nIn Example 1's input, row 4 has a 2 between the 8s in columns 3 and 14. In the output, that row has 2s between those columns. So maybe the rule is: if a row contains both 8s and a 2, then between the leftmost and rightmost 8 in that row, replace all with 2s, except the 8s at the ends. But in Example 1's row 4 input, there are 8s in columns 3 and 14, and a 2 in column 8. The output has 8s in columns 3 and 14, and 2s between them. So perhaps between the 8s, all positions become 2s. So in that case, the 8s act as boundaries, and the 2s fill the space between them.\n\nSo applying that rule to the test input's row 8, which has 8s at 4 and 12, and a 2 at 8. The output would have 8s at 4 and 12, and 2s from 4 to 12 in that row.\n\nSimilarly, row 14 has a 2 at column 16. But in that row, the 8s are at 4 and 12, so the 2 is outside (12 < 16). So no filling between 8s. Thus, only the vertical line of 2s downward.\n\nSo for any row that has 8s and a 2, if the 2 is between the leftmost and rightmost 8 in that row, then replace all cells between those 8s (inclusive) with 2s, except the 8s themselves? Or turn the 8s into 2s as well?\n\nWait, in Example 1's output row 4, the 8s at columns 3 and 14 are still 8s, and the cells between them are 2s. So the 8s act as endpoints, and the between cells are 2s. So the rule is: for any row that has at least two 8s and a 2, the cells between the leftmost and rightmost 8 become 2s, and the 8s remain.\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nIn row 8, which has 8s at columns 4 and 12, and a 2 at column 8. The leftmost 8 is at 4, rightmost at 12. So between them (columns 4 to 12), all cells become 2s, except the 8s at 4 and 12. So the output row 8 would have 8 at 4, then 2s from 5 to 11, 8 at 12, and the rest as per other rules.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1's output row 4, between columns 3 and 14, the cells are 2s except columns 3 and 14. So the output for row 4 is [0,0,8,2,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,2,8,0,0]. So between 3 and 14, the cells alternate between 8 and 2. Wait, no. Looking at Example 1's output row 4: it's [0,0,8,2,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,2,8,0,0]. So columns 2:8, 4:8, 13:8, 15:8. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, Example 1's input row 4 has 8s at columns 3 and 14. The output row 4 has:\n\n0, 0, 8, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 2, 8, 0, 0.\n\nWait, columns 2 is 8, column 4 is 8, column 13 is 8, column 15 is 8. So perhaps the leftmost 8 in input row 4 is column 3, but in output row 4, columns 2 and 4 are 8s, creating a diamond. So maybe the rule isn't simply filling between leftmost and rightmost 8s but expanding the 8s into a diamond pattern and then filling between them with 2s.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the correct approach is:\n\nFor each 8 in the input, create a cross (left, right, up, down) of 8s. For each 2 in the input, create a vertical line downward. Additionally, if a 2 is in the same row as two 8s, create a horizontal line of 2s between those 8s.\n\nSo, in the test input:\n\n- For each 8 in columns 4 and 12, add 8s to the left, right, above, and below. So each 8 would create a cross. But since they are in columns 4 and 12 for every row, this would generate a lot of 8s. For example, a row's 8 at column 4 would have 8s at 3 and 5, and the row above and below would have 8s at column 4. But since all rows have 8s at column 4, the crosses would overlap, creating vertical lines.\n\n- For each 2 in the input, create a vertical line downward. So the 2 in row 1, column 15 would have 2s in rows 2,3,4,... in column 15 until the end or another 8. The 2 in row 8, column 8 would create a vertical line downward. The 2 in row 14, column 16 would create a vertical line downward.\n\n- For rows where a 2 is present between two 8s in the same row (like row 8's 2 at column 8 between 4 and 12), create a horizontal line of 2s from 4 to 12.\n\nBut this might not exactly match the examples. Let's check Example 0 again. The input has a full row of 8s. In the output, that row has 2s inserted in positions 2 and 8 (assuming 0-based). Also, the rows above and below have horizontal 8s. So perhaps when there's a full row of 8s, it's modified by replacing certain positions with 2s and adding horizontal 8s in adjacent rows.\n\nAlternatively, the full row of 8s becomes a row where every third position is a 2, and the rows above and below have 8s in a pattern. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to draft the output based on the following assumptions:\n\n1. Each 2 in the input creates a vertical line of 2s downward.\n2. Each 8 in the input creates a cross of 8s (left, right, above, below).\n3. When a 2 is in the same row as two 8s, it creates a horizontal line of 2s between those 8s.\n\nApplying these to the test input:\n\n- For the vertical lines of 8s in columns 4 and 12, each 8 in these columns will create a cross. So, for example, row 0, column 4's 8 will have 8s at (0,3), (0,5), (-1,4) (but that's out of bounds), and (1,4). Since all rows have 8s in these columns, the crosses would overlap, creating solid vertical lines at columns 3,4,5 and 11,12,13, etc. But the actual output might have the 8s forming diamond patterns around these columns.\n\n- The 2 in row 1, column 15 will create a vertical line downward. Similarly, the 2 in row 8, column 8 will create a vertical line downward and, since it's between columns 4 and 12, a horizontal line from 4 to 12 in that row.\n\n- The 2 in row 14, column 16 will create a vertical line downward.\n\nSo, the final output would have:\n\n- For each row with 8s in columns 4 and 12, expanded into a diamond pattern (adjacent cells turned into 8s).\n\n- Vertical lines of 2s under each input 2.\n\n- Horizontal lines of 2s in rows where a 2 is between two 8s.\n\nBut this is still a bit vague, and without knowing the exact rules, it's hard to be precise. However, based on the examples, the output should have vertical 2 lines, diamonds around the 8 columns, and horizontal 2 lines where 2s are between 8s.\n\nFor example, in row 8 of the test input's output, there should be 2s from column 4 to 12, with 8s at the ends. Similarly, the vertical 8 columns would have diamonds around them.\n\nGiven that, I'll try to generate the test output based on these assumptions.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by analyzing the training examples one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input has a row of 8s and a couple of 2s. The output seems to add more 2s and 8s around the original positions. The 2s in the input are in rows 2 and 10. In the output, those 2s are extended downwards and there's a horizontal line of 8s with 2s in the middle. Maybe there's a cross shape being formed around the 2s, but only where there are 8s nearby?\n\nIn Example 1, the input has vertical lines of 8s and a single 2 in the middle. The output creates a diamond or cross pattern around that 2. The 8s form a sort of cross around the 2, and the 2s are surrounded by 8s. The vertical 8s in the input become part of a diamond shape in the output. Also, the 2 in the input row 4 gets a horizontal line of 2s, maybe extending in some direction.\n\nExample 2 is similar. The input has 8s in certain rows and 2s in others. The output shows that 2s are extended vertically and the 8s form horizontal bars around them. There's a horizontal line of 8s with 2s in the middle, and the 2s are stacked vertically in their original columns.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern might involve two steps. First, any 2 in the input is extended vertically in its column, creating a vertical line of 2s. Then, for rows that are entirely 8s (like a full horizontal line of 8s in the input), those rows in the output have a cross with 2 in the center and 8s around. Additionally, when a 2 is present in a column that's adjacent to 8s, it forms some kind of diamond or cross pattern with 8s and 2s.\n\nWait, let's check the rows. For example, in Example 0's input, the 7th row (0-indexed?) is all 8s. In the output, that row becomes a sequence of 8s with a 2 in the middle. Similarly, in Example 1's input, there's a vertical line of 8s, and in the output, the middle row (row 4) where the 2 is has a horizontal line of 2s flanked by 8s. So maybe the pattern is that when there's a 2 in a column, you create vertical lines of 2s in that column. And for any row in the input that's entirely 8s, in the output, those rows are transformed into a pattern where there's a 2 in the center of a horizontal line of 8s. Also, when a 2 is present near 8s, maybe it creates a cross.\n\nAnother observation: in the test input, there are vertical 8s in column 4 and column 12 (since every row has an 8 at index 4 and 12, except maybe some). Also, there are a couple of 2s in rows 1 and 14 (0-indexed). So applying the pattern, the 2s would extend vertically in their columns. For the rows that are not all 8s but have 8s in certain positions, maybe they form horizontal crosses around the 2s.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1 again: the input has vertical 8s in columns 3 and 14 (assuming 0-based). The output creates a diamond pattern around the 2. The 2 is in row 4, column 8. The output around that row has 8s forming a horizontal line with a 2 in the middle. Similarly, in Example 0, the row of 8s in the input becomes a row with 8s and a 2 in the middle in the output.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: For any row in the input that is entirely 8s, in the output, that row becomes a row where 8s are present except for the center position, which is a 2. But wait, in Example 0's input, the row with all 8s becomes a row with 8s and a 2 in the middle. The output's row 6 (input row 6) is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8] in input, and in output it's [8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. Wait, that's two 2s. Hmm, maybe that's because there are two 2s in the input columns. Let me check: in Example 0's input, there's a 2 in row 2 column 2 and row 10 column 8. So when the row of 8s is processed, maybe each 2's column in that row is replaced with a 2. So if the original row is all 8s, in the output row, any column that had a 2 in the original input (anywhere in the column) would have a 2 in that position of the row. Wait, but in the output of Example 0's row 6, the 2s are at positions 2 and 8. The original input's 2s are in column 2 (row 2) and column 8 (row 10). So the output row 6 (which was all 8s in input) now has 2s in columns 2 and 8, surrounded by 8s. So the rule seems to be: for any row in the input that is entirely 8s, in the output, that row will have 2s in the same columns where 2s were present in any other rows of the input, and the rest remain 8s. Additionally, the 2s in the original input columns are extended vertically. So for example, in Example 0, the 2 in row 2 column 2 creates a vertical line of 2s in column 2 from row 2 down to row 4. Similarly, the 2 in row 10 column 8 creates a vertical line from row 8 to 10 in column 8.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. For each 2 in the input, create a vertical line of 2s in that column, from the original position upwards and downwards until blocked by non-zero values or the edges. Wait, looking at Example 0's input, the original 2 in row 2 column 2. In the output, rows 2,3,4 in column 2 are 2. So maybe the vertical line extends down three rows. Or maybe the vertical line extends until the next non-zero (which in the input, there's 0s, so perhaps the 2s are extended downward as much as possible). But in Example 0, the 2 in row 10 column 8 has output rows 8,9,10 in column 8 as 2. So maybe the vertical lines are extended three rows down and three up? Or maybe it's a certain length. Alternatively, the vertical lines are extended until they hit the nearest 8 row. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the vertical 2s are extended until the row of 8s. For example, in Example 0, the 2 in row 2 column 2 is extended down to row 4, and the row 6 is all 8s. So maybe the 2s are extended down until the 8 row. Then, the 8 row is transformed as per the rules. Then the 2 in row 10 column 8 is extended up to row 8. So the vertical lines are extended until they reach the 8 rows. Then, in the 8 rows, the 2s are placed in the columns where the original 2s were.\n\nSo, steps might be:\n\n- For each 2 in the input, create a vertical line of 2s from that position upwards and downwards until a row that is all 8s (or the edge of the grid). Then, in the rows that were all 8s in the input, replace the 8s in the columns that have a 2 in any row (from the original input) with 2s, and leave the rest as 8s. Also, maybe create horizontal lines of 8s around the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 rows in the input are transformed into rows where each column that has a 2 in any row (original input) becomes a 2, and the rest remain 8s. So for example, in Example 0, the input has two 2s in columns 2 and 8. So in the output, the row that was all 8s (row 6) now has 2s in columns 2 and 8. The other columns remain 8. But in the output for row 6, it's [8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8]. So yes, exactly. So the rule for rows that are all 8s in the input is to replace any column that had a 2 in any row of the input with a 2, and keep the rest as 8s.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the input has a row of 8s (but the input rows have 8s in columns 3 and 14, but not all 8s). Wait, in Example 1's input, each row has 8s in columns 3 and 14, but other positions are 0. So those rows are not all 8s. However, in the output, rows 3 and 5 (assuming 0-based) have 8s arranged in a horizontal pattern around the 2. So perhaps when there's a 2 in a row, the 8s in adjacent rows form a diamond or cross pattern. Alternatively, maybe the 2s are expanded horizontally and vertically, but only if there are 8s around.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the steps based on the examples:\n\n1. Vertical expansion of 2s: Each 2 in the input is extended vertically (up and down) in its column, creating a vertical line of 2s. The length of the extension might be until the next non-zero (non-8?) row. For example, in Example 0, the 2 in row 2 column 2 is extended down to row 4. But in the input, rows below are 0s. So maybe the vertical extension is three cells down? Because the output has rows 2,3,4 as 2s. Similarly, the 2 in row 10 column 8 is extended up to row 8,9,10. So three cells? That seems like a possible pattern.\n\n2. For rows that are entirely 8s in the input: Replace the columns where any 2 exists in the input with 2s. So if in the input there's a 2 in column 5, then in the all-8 rows of the input, column 5 becomes 2, and others remain 8.\n\n3. Additionally, around the vertical lines of 2s, maybe there are horizontal 8s added. For example, in Example 0's output row 5, there are 8s around the 2s. Looking at row 5 in the output of Example 0: [0,8,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]. So maybe for each vertical line of 2s, there's a horizontal bar of 8s three cells wide centered on the 2's column. But why in row 5? Because row 5 is adjacent to the all-8s row (row 6 in input). So maybe when a vertical line of 2s is near an all-8 row, horizontal bars are added.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal bars are added in the rows adjacent to the all-8 rows. For example, in Example 0, the all-8 row is row 6 (input). The output's row 5 and 7 have horizontal 8s around the 2s. So perhaps, for each all-8 row in the input, the rows immediately above and below in the output get horizontal 8s around the 2 columns.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complex, but let's try applying this to the test input.\n\nThe test input has 8s in columns 4 and 12 in each row. Wait, looking at the test input rows:\n\nFirst row: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo columns 4 and 12 have 8s. The 2s are in row 1 (column 15), row 2 (column 1), row 8 (column 8), and row 14 (column 16). Wait, let's index from 0. The test input's rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns 4 and 12 have 8.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0] \u2192 column 4, 12, 15.\n\nRow 2: [0,2,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column 1,4,12.\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 column 4,8,12.\n\nRow 14: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,2,0,0] \u2192 column 4,12,16.\n\nSo the 2s are in columns 1,15,8,16. Each of these columns in the input has 2s in different rows.\n\nFirst step: For each 2 in the input, create vertical lines in their columns. Let's see:\n\n- The 2 in row 1 column 15 (0-based?) \u2192 if columns are 0-based, then column 15 is index 15. So in column 15, the 2 is in row 1. So the vertical line would extend up to row 0 (if possible) and down. But according to the examples, maybe the vertical lines are extended three cells. So from row 1, extending up one and down two. Wait, in Example 0, the 2 in row 2 was extended down to rows 3 and 4. So three cells total. So perhaps each 2 is extended two cells below and one above? Or maybe three cells in total. Let's see Example 0: original row 2 \u2192 output rows 2,3,4. That's three rows. So maybe each 2 is extended to cover three rows, centered on the original. Wait, row 2 is the original, and then rows 2,3,4. So two rows below. Similarly, the 2 in row 10 becomes rows 8,9,10. So maybe the 2 is extended up two rows and down two? Wait, row 10 to 8,9,10 would be three rows. So maybe each 2 creates a vertical line of three cells, starting at the original and extending downward. Or perhaps upward and downward as much as possible. It's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 2 is extended as far as possible downwards until they hit a non-zero cell. In Example 0, the 2 in row 2 column 2 is in a column where rows below are all 0s except for row 6 (all 8s). So the vertical line extends down to row 4 (three rows) before hitting the all-8 row. Then, the all-8 row (row 6) has 2s in columns where there were original 2s.\n\nBut how does this apply to other examples? Let's check Example 1. The input has a 2 in row 4 column 8. The output has a vertical line of 2s in column 8 starting at row 4. But in the output, rows 4,5,6 (maybe) have 2s? Wait, in Example 1's output, row 4 has [0,0,8,2,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,2,8,0,0]. The 2s in column 8 (index 8) are in row 4? Wait, maybe it's not just vertical lines, but also horizontal.\n\nThis is getting a bit too complicated. Let's try to focus on the test input.\n\nIn the test input, the 8s are present in columns 4 and 12 in every row. So those columns are vertical lines of 8s. The 2s are in columns 1 (row 2), 15 (row 1), 8 (row 8), and 16 (row 14). So applying the pattern:\n\n1. Each 2 in the input will create a vertical line of 2s in their respective columns. For example, the 2 in row 2 column 1 will have 2s in column 1, rows 0,1,2,3,4? Or maybe three rows. It's unclear. The examples show varying lengths. But in Example 0, the vertical line was three rows long. So perhaps each 2 is extended two rows below and one above? Or three rows in total.\n\nAssuming three rows, the 2 in row 1 column 15 would extend to rows 0,1,2. The 2 in row 2 column 1 would extend to rows 1,2,3. The 2 in row 8 column 8 would extend to rows 7,8,9. The 2 in row 14 column 16 would extend to rows 13,14,15.\n\n2. For the rows that are all 8s in the input. Wait, in the test input, none of the rows are entirely 8s. All rows have 8s in columns 4 and 12, but other columns are 0. So the 8s are not in full rows. Therefore, maybe the pattern for rows with 8s is different. Alternatively, the vertical 8s (columns 4 and 12) are treated as part of a structure. For example, in Example 1, the vertical 8s (columns 3 and 14) in the input are used to form cross patterns around the 2s.\n\nIn the test input, the vertical 8s in columns 4 and 12 might form horizontal crosses around the 2s. For example, each 2 in the input (columns 1,15,8,16) would have horizontal 8s added in their row, centered on their column, and possibly vertical 8s.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical 8s in columns 4 and 12 are part of the structure that affects how the 2s are transformed. For example, when a 2 is present in a column adjacent to these 8s, a cross of 8s is formed around the 2.\n\nBut this is getting speculative. Maybe the key is to look at the existing examples and see how they handle vertical 8s and 2s.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has vertical 8s (columns 3 and 14) and a 2 in column 8. The output forms a diamond pattern around the 2 with 8s and 2s. So the 2 is in the middle of a horizontal line of 2s flanked by 8s, and the vertical 8s form part of the diamond.\n\nIn the test input, the vertical 8s are in columns 4 and 12. The 2s are in columns 1,8,15,16. So perhaps for each 2, a horizontal cross of 8s is added in their row, and the vertical line of 2s is extended. Additionally, in the rows where the vertical 8s are present, they form a pattern with the 2s.\n\nBut perhaps the main transformation is:\n\n- For each 2 in the input, extend vertically in their column to form a vertical line of three 2s (original plus two below).\n\n- For any row in the input that contains a vertical 8 (like columns 4 and 12 in the test input), in the output, around each 2 in that row, create horizontal 8s.\n\nAlternatively, when a vertical 8 column is adjacent to a 2, create a cross of 8s around the 2.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each 2, create a vertical line of 2s in their column, and create horizontal 8s in the same row as the original 2. For example, in Example 0's output, row 2 (original 2) has a horizontal 8s around it. But no, row 2 in Example 0's output is [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the horizontal 8s are added in the rows adjacent to the vertical 2 lines, forming a cross. For instance, in Example 0's output, rows 5 and 7 have horizontal 8s around the 2s from the vertical lines. So for each vertical 2 line, the rows above and below the line have horizontal 8s centered on the 2's column.\n\nIn the test input, for each vertical line of 2s, we would add horizontal 8s in the adjacent rows. For example, the 2 in row 2 column 1 creates a vertical line in column 1. The rows adjacent to this line (rows 1,2,3) would have horizontal 8s around column 1. But since the vertical 8s are in columns 4 and 12, maybe those interact.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Let's try to focus on the test input and see what the expected output might look like.\n\nGiven the test input's vertical 8s in columns 4 and 12, and 2s in columns 1,15,8,16.\n\nFollowing Example 1's pattern, where a vertical 8 column and a 2 in another column leads to a diamond pattern. For each 2 in the test input:\n\n- The 2 in row 1 column 15: might form a horizontal line of 2s and 8s in that row. For example, in the output, row 1 would have 8s in columns 13,14,15,16,17 (centered on 15) and 2s elsewhere.\n\nWait, but in Example 1's output, the 2 in row 4 column 8 is surrounded by 8s in a diamond pattern. So perhaps each 2 in the test input's row would have a horizontal cross of 8s around them, and the vertical 2s are extended.\n\nAlternatively, the output for each row with a 2 would have a horizontal line of 8s centered on the 2's column. For example, the 2 in row 1 column 15 would have 8s in columns 13-17 (forming a horizontal line of 8s with a 2 in the center). But in Example 1's output, the 2 in row 4 is part of a horizontal line of 2s and 8s. So maybe when there are multiple 2s in a row, their patterns merge.\n\nThis is really tricky. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis:\n\nThe pattern involves:\n\n1. For each 2 in the input, create a vertical line of 2s in that column, three cells long (original + two below).\n\n2. In any row that has a 2, create a horizontal line of 8s centered on that 2's column, three cells wide (so the 2 is in the center of three 8s).\n\n3. For any row in the input that is a vertical line of 8s (like columns 4 and 12 in the test input), in the output, those columns remain 8s, and intersecting with the horizontal 8s from the 2s.\n\nBut this may not fit all examples, but given the time, I'll proceed with applying this to the test input.\n\nApplying to the test input:\n\n- Each 2 in the input is extended vertically three cells. For example, the 2 in row 1 column 15 (assuming rows are 0-indexed) would extend down to rows 2 and 3. But looking at the output examples, maybe the extension is three cells including the original. So row 1's 2 in column 15 would create 2s in rows 1,2,3 in column 15.\n\nSimilarly, the 2 in row 2 column 1 would create 2s in rows 2,3,4 in column 1.\n\nThe 2 in row 8 column 8 would create 2s in rows 8,9,10.\n\nThe 2 in row 14 column 16 would create 2s in rows 14,15,16.\n\nThen, for each row that has a 2 (original or extended), create a horizontal line of 8s around the 2. For example, in row 1 column 15, there would be 8s in columns 13-17, with 15 as a 2. But wait, in the original input, there are 8s in columns 4 and 12. So perhaps the horizontal 8s merge with those.\n\nThis is getting too ambiguous. Given the examples, perhaps the final answer should have vertical 2s in the columns where the input has 2s, extended three cells. Then, the rows that were all 8s in the input (which in the test input there are none) but since the test input has vertical 8s in columns 4 and 12, maybe those are treated as part of a structure where the horizontal lines are added around the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, the answer would involve expanding each 2 into a vertical line and adding horizontal 8s around them.\n\nBut given the time, I'll draft an output based on the following steps:\n\n1. For each 2 in the input, extend vertically three cells (original and two below).\n\n2. In the rows that have vertical extensions of 2s, add horizontal 8s around each 2.\n\n3. The existing 8s in columns 4 and 12 remain 8s.\n\nFor example, in row 1 column 15 (now a 2), add 8s in columns 14 and 16. In row 2 column 1 (2), add 8s in columns 0 and 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, for each 2 in a row, replace the cells to the left and right with 8s, creating a horizontal bar of 8s centered on the 2.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the 2 in row 4 column 8 has 8s on either side. So in the output row 4, the 2 is flanked by 8s, and there's a line of 2s extending horizontally. Hmm.\n\nIn any case, I'll proceed to create an output where the 2s are extended vertically, and horizontal 8s are added around them. The existing 8s in columns 4 and 12 remain.\n\nFor the test input's row 1 (original 2 in column 15), after extending vertically, there's a 2 in column 15 for rows 1,2,3. In each of those rows, columns 14 and 16 become 8s. Similarly, for row 2 column 1, extend vertically to rows 2,3,4, and add 8s in columns 0 and 2.\n\nBut this might not cover all cases. Given the complexity, the final answer would have vertical lines of 2s and horizontal 8s around them, while preserving the existing vertical 8s in columns 4 and 12.\n\nHere's an attempt:\n\nFor each 2 in the input:\n\n- Extend vertically three cells (original and two below).\n\n- In each of those rows, add 8s to the left and right of the 2.\n\nAdditionally, for the vertical 8 columns (4 and 12), they remain 8s.\n\nSo for the 2 in row 1 column 15:\n\n- Rows 1,2,3 in column 15 become 2.\n\n- In each of these rows, columns 14 and 16 become 8.\n\nFor the 2 in row 2 column 1:\n\n- Rows 2,3,4 column 1 become 2.\n\n- In each of these rows, columns 0 and 2 become 8.\n\nFor the 2 in row 8 column 8:\n\n- Rows 8,9,10 column 8 become 2.\n\n- In each of these rows, columns 7 and 9 become 8.\n\nFor the 2 in row 14 column 16:\n\n- Rows 14,15,16 column 16 become 2.\n\n- In each of these rows, columns 15 and 17 become 8.\n\nAdditionally, the existing 8s in columns 4 and 12 are preserved.\n\nPutting this together, the output would have the vertical 2 lines with horizontal 8s around them, and the vertical 8s in columns 4 and 12.\n\nNow, let's see the test input's row 1:\n\nOriginal: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0]\n\nAfter processing:\n\nColumn 15 (original 2) becomes 2 in rows 1,2,3.\n\nIn row 1:\n\n- Column 15 is 2.\n\n- Columns 14 and 16 become 8.\n\n- Existing 8s in columns 4 and 12 remain.\n\nSo row 1 becomes: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,2,8,0,0]\n\nSimilarly, row 2:\n\nOriginal column 1 has a 2. Processed as:\n\n- Column 1 becomes 2 in rows 2,3,4.\n\n- In row 2, columns 0 and 2 become 8.\n\nBut row 2's original data: [0,2,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nProcessed:\n\nColumns 0 and 2 become 8, column 1 becomes 2 (already is), and columns 4 and 12 remain 8.\n\nSo row 2 becomes: [8,2,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but in the example outputs, sometimes the 8s are added in a horizontal line. For instance, in Example 0's output row 5, it's [0,8,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0]. This suggests that around each 2's column, three 8s are added (left, center, right), but center is the 2. Wait, no. In that row, the 2 is not present; instead, the 8s are added where the vertical 2s are. So perhaps for each vertical 2 column, in certain rows, a horizontal bar of three 8s is added, centered on the 2's column.\n\nIn Example 0's output row 5, the vertical 2s are in columns 2 and 8. So the horizontal 8s are in columns 1-3 and 7-9. So three 8s around each 2 column.\n\nThus, the rule might be: for each vertical 2 column, in the rows adjacent to the all-8 rows (from the input), add a horizontal bar of three 8s centered on the 2's column.\n\nBut in the test input, there are no all-8 rows. So this part might not apply. Therefore, maybe the horizontal bars are added in the same rows where the vertical 2s are.\n\nAlternatively, the horizontal 8s are added in the same rows as the original 2s.\n\nBut given time constraints, I'll proceed with generating the output based on vertical 2s and horizontal 8s around them, along with existing 8s.\n\nThe final answer would look like this for each row:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,2,8,0,0\n\nRow 2: 8,2,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 8: 0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 14: 0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,2,8\n\nBut I'm not confident. Given the time, I'll provide the answer in the required format, matching the training examples' style.",
