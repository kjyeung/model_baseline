        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a 10x10 grid of numbers, and the output seems to be a modified version of that grid. The goal is to see how the input gets transformed into the output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. Let's compare the input and output. The first three rows in the input have numbers like 1s, 5, 0s, and 7s. The output for those rows changes some of the 7s to 5s. For instance, in the fifth row (0-indexed as row 5?), the input has 6,6 in the middle. The output changes those to 5,5. Similarly, in the sixth and seventh rows, the 6s become 5s. Also, the 8s in the input's last rows remain the same in the output.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the output changes the 6s and 7s in certain positions to 5s. But the 7s in the upper part (like row 0, column 7) stay as 7, but in rows 6 and 7, the 7s become 5s. Hmm, maybe it's related to the position of the numbers relative to other elements. Or maybe there's a replacement happening based on certain regions.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input has a 9 in the bottom part (row 7 and 8). The output changes those 9s to 5s. Also, in Example 0, the 6s and 7s in the lower part became 5s, while the upper 7s remained. So maybe there's a vertical component here. Like numbers below a certain row get replaced with 5, or perhaps any numbers that are part of a certain shape or connected region.\n\nWait, looking at the first example's input and output, the 7s in the lower left (rows 6 and 7) remain as 7s, but the 9 in row 7, column 8 becomes 5. Wait, maybe it's not just vertical. Maybe any number that is in a \"branch\" or connected to a central structure? Or perhaps numbers that are part of a certain cluster.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the largest number in the grid. Wait, in Example 0, the input has 1,5,7,6,8. The output changes 6 and 7 to 5. The largest number in the input is 8, but that remains. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: in Example 0, the output changes the 6 and 7 in the lower part to 5. Similarly, in Example 1, the 9 becomes 5, and in Example 2, the 1s in the upper right become 5. So maybe numbers that are part of certain regions (like the lower parts) get replaced with 5. But how to determine which regions?\n\nWait, maybe the 5s are central, and other numbers adjacent to them are getting replaced. Let's look at the structure. In all examples, there's a central 5 in a cross shape. For example, in Example 0's input, the fourth row is all 5s. Then, other numbers around it. The output seems to replace some numbers with 5. Maybe any numbers that are part of a \"branch\" that's connected to the central 5 cross?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that any number that is part of a shape that's adjacent to the central cross (the 5s) gets replaced by 5. Let's check. In Example 0, the lower part has 6s and 7s. The 6s are in a horizontal line, and the 7s are in a vertical line. But in the output, those 6s become 5s, and the 7s in that area become 5s. Maybe those shapes are considered part of the cross's extensions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the depth from the central cross. The central cross is the 5s. Any numbers that are in regions connected via non-zero paths to the central cross are turned into 5s. Let's see. In Example 0's input, the 6s and 7s in the lower part are connected? Let me visualize the input grid.\n\nExample 0's input:\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [7,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0]\n\nWait, the 6s are in row 5 (columns 5,6), row6 (columns 6,7), row7 (column7). So the 6s form a kind of diagonal line. The 7s in row6 are columns 0,1,2 and row7 column2. So they form a vertical line. But in the output, these 6s and 7s are replaced by 5. How are they connected to the central cross?\n\nThe central cross in example 0 is rows 0-3, perhaps. The central cross is the 5s in row3 (all 5s). Then, rows 0,1,2 have 5s in column3. So the cross is vertical along column3 and horizontal in row3.\n\nThe 6s are in rows5-7. How are they connected to the cross? Maybe not directly. So perhaps the replacement is based on some other criteria.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the numbers that are replaced. In Example 0, the numbers 6 and 7 in the lower part are replaced by 5. In Example 1, the 9 is replaced by 5. In Example 2, the 1s (original in input) are replaced by 5s. So the numbers being replaced are varying (6,7,9,1) but all turn into 5. So it's not a fixed number replacement. So the question is, what determines which numbers get replaced by 5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number that is the highest in the grid (excluding 5 and 0) gets replaced by 5. Let's check. In Example 0, the input has numbers 1,5,6,7,8. The highest is 8, but it's not replaced. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: the numbers being replaced are those that form certain shapes. Like, the 6s and 7s in Example 0 form a kind of cross shape (like a T maybe?), and then are replaced by 5. But in the output, their shape remains the same, but their numbers change to 5. So perhaps the pattern is to replace certain numbers that form a specific pattern with 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace all instances of the second-highest number in the grid with 5. Let's see. In Example 0, numbers are 1,5,6,7,8. The highest is 8, next is 7. The 7s are replaced in some areas but not all. For example, in row 0, column7 is 7 and it remains. So that might not fit.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has numbers 4,5,1,3,6. The output changes the 1s to 5s. The 1s are in row0, column7, row1 columns6-8. So those 1s are replaced by 5s. What's special about them? They form a sort of horizontal line. But how is that determined?\n\nWait, maybe the numbers that are part of a group (contiguous cells with the same number) that is adjacent to the central 5 cross are replaced by 5. Let's check. In Example 0, the central cross is the 5s in row3 and column3. The 7s in row6 and 7 might not be adjacent. The 6s are in rows5-7, but perhaps adjacent via proximity. Alternatively, maybe groups that are connected through adjacent cells (including diagonally) to the central cross. Hmm, but the 6s in example 0's input are in row5, which is two rows below row3. Not directly adjacent. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternative approach: compare the input and output for each example and see exactly which cells changed. Then find the pattern in those changes.\n\nExample 0 changes:\n\nIn row5, columns5 and6: 6 \u21925.\n\nRow6, columns0-2 (7\u21925?), columns6 and7 (6\u21925).\n\nRow7, column2 (7\u21925), column7 (6\u21925).\n\nWait no, in the input of example0:\n\nOriginal row5: [0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row5: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nOriginal row6: [7,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,0]\n\nOutput row6: [7,7,7,0,0,0,5,5,0,0] \u2192 wait no, original row6 has 7s in columns0-2 and 6-7. The output row6 shows 7s in columns0-2 and 5 in 6-7. Wait, looking at the input and output:\n\nWait, in example0's input:\n\nRow6: [7,7,7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\nOutput row6: [7,7,7, 0, 0, 0,5,5,0,0]\n\nSo the 6s in row6 columns6-7 are changed to 5. But the 7s in columns0-2 remain 7.\n\nSo in example0, the 6s are replaced by 5s, but the 7s in row6 and 7 are also changed? Wait, in row7 of input: [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0]. Output row7: [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]. So the 7 in column2 stays, but the 6 in column7 is changed to 5. Hmm. So why are those 6s changed but some 7s not?\n\nWait maybe there's a different logic. Let's look at example1:\n\nIn the input, the 9 in row7 column8 is changed to 5 in the output. The 9 is part of a group in row8 (9,9) and row7. But how does that relate to the central cross? The central cross here is the 5s in row3 and column3. The 9s are far from that. So perhaps it's not about proximity.\n\nLooking at example2's changes: the 1s in row0 column7 and row1 columns6-8 are changed to 5. The central cross is again the 5s in row3 and column3. The 1s are in the upper right. How are they connected?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the numbers that are in the same row or column as the central 5 cross. But in example0, the 5s are in column3 and row3. The 6s in rows5-7, columns5-7. Not in the same row or column.\n\nWait, perhaps the central cross is the row3 and column3. Any number that is in a cell that is part of a group that is connected via a path of the same number to the cross's row or column. For example, if a group is touching the cross's row or column through same numbers. But in example0, the 6s are not connected to the cross. The cross is in column3 and row3. The 6s are in columns5-7, rows5-7. Not connected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers that are part of a certain shape, like a T-shape, or cross shape, are replaced. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look at the output. In each example, the output has more 5s than the input, except perhaps the central cross. So the transformation adds 5s by replacing other numbers. The question is: which numbers are replaced, and why.\n\nLooking at example0's output, the 6s and some 7s are replaced. In example1's output, the 9 is replaced. In example2's output, the 1s are replaced. So each example is replacing different numbers with 5. But why?\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the numbers that form a \"branch\" off the main cross. The main cross is the row3 and column3 of 5s. Any other numbers that are adjacent to this cross (possibly in a plus shape) get replaced. Wait, but in example0, the 7s in row0, column7 are not adjacent to the cross but are part of the output. So maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, looking at the first example's input and output: the 9s are in row7-8 columns8-9. The output changes them to 5. But why? How are they connected to the cross. They are far away. Maybe it's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each example has a specific number that is being replaced with 5. For example0, replacing 6 and 7. For example1, replacing 9. For example2, replacing 1. But that seems arbitrary. Unless there's a rule like \"replace the largest number except 5 and 8\". Let's check. In example0: numbers are 1,5,6,7,8. The largest is 8 (not replaced), next is 7 and 6 (replaced). So maybe replacing the second highest. But in example1, numbers are 3,4,5,7,8,9. The highest is9, which is replaced. So that fits. Example2 has numbers 1,3,4,5,6, etc. The highest is6, but in the output, the 1s are replaced. So that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: look at the positions of the replaced numbers. In example0, the replaced numbers (6s and some 7s) are in rows5-7, columns5-7. The central cross is rows0-3. So maybe the lower half of the grid has certain replacements. But example1's replaced 9 is in the lower right. Example2's replaced 1s are in upper right. So perhaps it's not a positional thing.\n\nAlternatively, think of the central cross as a plus shape (row3 is all 5s, and column3 has 5s in rows0-3). Then, any group that is connected to this cross through other numbers, perhaps in a certain direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers to replace are those that are part of a cluster (contiguous same numbers) that is not the central cross. The largest cluster (by cell count) remains, and others are replaced by 5. Wait, but in example0, the central cross is the largest. The 6s and 7s are smaller clusters, which are replaced. In example1, the 9 cluster is replaced. In example2, the 1 cluster is replaced. So perhaps the clusters that are not part of the central cross and are of a certain size get replaced by 5. But how to determine which ones.\n\nAlternatively, the clusters that are in the same row or column as the central cross. For example, in example0's input, the 6s are in column5-7, which are not column3. But the 7s are in column0-2 and 7. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of each example as having a central cross of 5s, and then other clusters. The output replaces clusters that are adjacent in some way. Like, if a cluster is adjacent to the cross, it's replaced. But in example0, the 6s and 7s are not adjacent. Alternatively, the cross is in the center, and any cluster that is positioned like a mirror image across the cross gets replaced. For example, if the cross is at the center (row3, column3), then clusters in the lower half might be mirrored in some way and replaced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is based on the number of cells in the cluster. For example, in example0, the 6 cluster has 5 cells (rows5-7, columns5-7: 6s in row5:2, row6:2, row7:1?), total of 5 cells. The 7 cluster in example0's input has 4 cells (row6:3, row7:1). Maybe clusters with a certain size are replaced. But example1's 9 cluster is 2 cells, which is small. Example2's 1 cluster is 5 cells. So not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in example0's output, the replaced 6s and 7s are in the lower part. The output's 5s form a sort of cross extending into those areas. Similarly, in example1's output, the 5 replaces the 9s in the lower right. In example2's output, the 5s are in the upper right. So maybe the output is expanding the 5 cross into those areas.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to replace any cluster that is in a row or column that intersects the central cross. For example, the central cross is row3 and column3. Any cluster that has elements in row3 or column3 (but not part of the central cross) gets replaced by 5. But in example0, the central cross is row3 (all 5s) and column3 (rows0-3). So any cluster in row3 or column3 would already be part of the cross. So that doesn't explain the changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace all clusters except the central cross and the largest cluster. But in example0, the central cross is the largest. The replaced clusters are smaller.\n\nAlternatively, the output is mirroring the input's clusters across the central cross and replacing them with 5s. For example, in example0's input, there's a cluster of 1s in the upper left. In the output, those remain. The cluster of 7s and 6s in the lower part are mirrored or transformed into 5s. But I'm not sure how the mirroring would work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that any number that is part of a cluster (contiguous same numbers) that is not connected to the central cross is replaced by 5. But in example0, the 1s are connected to the cross. Let me check. The 1s in example0 are in the upper left. The central cross's column3 has 5s in rows0-3. The 1s are in row0-2, column0-2, which are adjacent to the 5s in column3. So maybe they're connected via adjacency. So perhaps the clusters that are connected to the central cross are kept, and others are replaced. But in example0, the 6s and 7s are not connected to the cross, so they're replaced. In example1, the 9s are not connected, so replaced. In example2, the 1s are not connected, so replaced. That seems plausible.\n\nSo the pattern could be: All clusters (groups of connected same numbers) that are not connected to the central cross (row3 and column3) are replaced by 5. But wait, the central cross is the 5s in row3 and column3. So any cluster connected to this cross would include the 5s. But other clusters (like 1s, 6s, etc.) that are not connected to the cross would be replaced by 5.\n\nWait, in example0's input, the 1s are in rows0-2, columns0-2. The central cross's column3 has 5s. Are the 1s connected to the 5s? They are adjacent in row0, column3 (which is 5 in row0, column3). So the 1s in row0, columns0-2 are adjacent to the 5 in column3. So that would mean the 1s are connected to the cross. So they are not replaced. Similarly, the 7s in the upper part (row0, column7) is adjacent to 5? No, row0, column3 is 5, but column7 is far. So the 7s in row0-2, column7 are not connected to the cross, so they remain. Wait but in example0's output, those 7s remain. So according to this hypothesis, only clusters not connected to the cross are replaced. But in example0, the 6s and 7s in the lower part are not connected to the cross, so they are replaced by 5. That fits. Similarly, example1's 9s are not connected to the cross, replaced by5. Example2's 1s are not connected to the cross, replaced by5. So this seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern is: All clusters (contiguous regions of the same number) that are not connected (via orthogonal adjacency) to the central cross of 5s (row3 and column3) are replaced by 5. Clusters connected to the cross remain.\n\nBut how to determine connectedness. Let's check example0's 1s. The 1s are in row0, columns0-1 and row1, columns1-2, etc. The 5s are in column3. In row0, column3 is 5. The 1 in row0, column0 is adjacent (left) to column1, which is 1, which is adjacent to column2, which is 0. So the 1s in row0 are at columns0-1. Are they connected to column3's 5? The 1s in row0, columns0-1 are adjacent to the 5 in row0, column3 via left? No, they are two columns away. So they are not connected. Wait, but in example0's input, the first row is [1,1,0,5,...], so row0, columns0 and1 are 1s, column3 is 5. So the 1s are separated by a 0. So they are not adjacent to the 5. Therefore, according to the hypothesis, the 1s should be replaced. But in example0's output, the 1s are not replaced. So that contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nHmm, so maybe my previous idea is wrong. Let me re-examine example0. In the input, the 1s are in the upper left, and the 5s are in the middle. The 1s are not adjacent to the 5s. So according to the hypothesis, they would be replaced. But in the output, they remain. So that's a problem.\n\nSo maybe the connectedness is not the criterion. Let's think again.\n\nAlternative idea: The central cross is the 5s in row3 and column3. Any clusters that are within the same quadrant as the cross are kept, and others are replaced. But the quadrants are not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe clusters that are vertically or horizontally aligned with the cross are kept. For example, the 1s in example0 are in the upper left, which is not aligned with the cross's position. But how to define alignment.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers that are in the same row or column as the central cross are kept. But in example0, the 1s are in row0, which is the same row as the cross's row0 (column3). So the 1s are in row0, but not in column3. So maybe the row is part of the cross's row, so the 1s are kept. Similarly, the 7s in row0, column7 are in the same row as the cross's row0, so they are kept. The 6s in row5 are in a different row, not part of the cross's rows (rows0-3?), so they are replaced.\n\nWait, the central cross's rows are row3 (all 5s), and column3 (rows0-3). So rows0-3 have 5s in column3. So any clusters in rows0-3 would be kept, and others replaced? But in example0, the 1s are in rows0-2, which are part of the rows0-3. So they are kept. The 7s in row6 are outside of rows0-3, so their cluster is replaced. The 6s are in row5-7, which are outside, so replaced. The 8s are in rows8-9, which are outside, but in example0's output, the 8s remain. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nHmm. So example0's 8s are in rows8-9, which are outside the cross's rows0-3. According to this idea, they should be replaced. But they are not. So that's a problem.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for what is common among the replaced numbers in all examples.\n\nIn example0, replaced numbers are 6 and 7 (but not all of them). Wait, in example0's input, the 6s are in rows5-7, and they are replaced by 5. The 7s in row6 and 7 are part of a cluster that's replaced. The 7s in rows0-2 (upper part) are not replaced. So why?\n\nWait, looking at example0's input:\n\nThe 7s in row0, column7: 7 is present here. In the output, it's still 7.\n\nIn row1, columns6-8 are 7s. Output: 7s remain.\n\nRow2, column7: 7 in input, output remains.\n\nBut in row6, columns0-2 are 7s. Output: they remain.\n\nRow7, column2:7 in input, output remains.\n\nWait, then which 7s are replaced? Looking back, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nExample0's input and output:\n\nInput row6: [7,7,7, 0, 0, 0, 6,6,0,0]\n\nOutput row6: [7,7,7, 0, 0, 0,5,5,0,0]\n\nSo the 7s in row6 are kept, but the 6s are replaced. So the 6s are replaced, but 7s in the same row are not. So why?\n\nThis suggests that the replacement is not about the cluster's position but about the number itself. For example, in example0, the 6s and some 7s are replaced. Wait, but example0's output has 7s in row6. So perhaps the replacement is only for certain numbers, regardless of their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for numbers that form a certain pattern. For example, if a number is part of a T-shape or a vertical/horizontal line of certain length.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers that are in the same row or column as the cross, but not part of the cross itself, are replaced. But in example0, the 6s are in row5, which is not part of the cross's rows. The 7s in row6 are not part of the cross's rows.\n\nAlternatively, think of the central cross as the main structure, and any other structures that are similar in shape to the cross are replaced. But the cross is row3 (all 5s) and column3 (rows0-3). So other crosses would be similar. For example, in example0's input, the 7s in row6, columns0-2 form a horizontal line of 3, which could be part of a cross. But they are not replaced. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: the numbers that are replaced are those that are in a row or column that intersects the central cross but are not part of it. For example, in example0, row0 has a 5 in column3. The 1s in row0 are in columns0-1. They are in the same row as the cross's row0 but not part of the cross. But they are not replaced. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers that are in the same row or column as the central cross and are adjacent to it are replaced. For example, in row0, columns adjacent to column3 (columns2 and4) could be replaced, but in example0's row0, columns0-1 are 1s, column3 is 5, others are 0. So not applicable.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has the same structure as the input, but certain numbers are replaced with 5. The replaced numbers seem to form their own clusters. For example0: 6s and some 7s; example1: 9s; example2:1s. The pattern might be that the cluster with the smallest number (excluding 0) is replaced by 5. Let's check:\n\nExample0 input numbers: 1,5,6,7,8. Smallest is 1, but the 1s are not replaced. 6 is next, and they are replaced. But example1 has 3,4,5,7,8,9. The smallest is3, but 3 is not replaced. 9 is the largest, and it's replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: the number of occurrences. The least frequent non-zero number (excluding 5) is replaced. In example0, 1 appears 4 times, 6 appears 5 times, 7 appears 6 times, 8 appears 3 times. So the least frequent is8 (3 times), but it's not replaced. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the number that is present in the most clusters. But this also doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to replace the largest cluster (by cell count) that is not the central cross. Let's check:\n\nIn example0, the central cross is 4 rows (row3 has 10 cells, but in example0's input, row3 is all 5s. Column3 has 4 cells (rows0-3). So the central cross has 10 (row3) + 3 (column3 rows0-2) - 1 (overlap at row3, column3) = 12 cells. Other clusters: 1s (maybe 4 cells), 6s (5 cells), 7s (6 cells?), 8s (3 cells). The largest cluster is the 7s with 6 cells. But in example0's output, the 6s and 7s in the lower part are replaced. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, the clusters that are furthest from the central cross are replaced. But measuring distance is tricky.\n\nAnother Idea: After looking closely at the examples, perhaps the transformation is to replace all instances of a certain number with 5, where that number is chosen based on its position relative to the central cross. For example, the number that is in the cell that is diagonally opposite to the central cross's position. But the central cross is in row3, column3. Diagonally opposite cells would vary based on grid size.\n\nAlternatively, the number in the fourth row (index 4) and fourth column (index 4) is replaced. But in example0's input, row4 is all zeros. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the number that is in the lowest row of the grid (row9) is the one to replace. But in example0's input, row9 has 8s. They remain in the output. So that's not it.\n\nWait, let's look at the Test Input and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 0,5,0,0,0,6,0,0]\n\n[2,2,2,5,0,0,0,6,6,0]\n\n[0,0,2,5,0,0,0,6,0,0]\n\n[5,5,5,5,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0]\n\n[8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\n[8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,7,7,7,0,4,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]\n\nCentral cross is row3 (all 5s) and column3 (rows0-3). So the central cross is as usual.\n\nNow, in the output of previous examples, certain clusters are replaced by 5. In this test input, what's likely to be replaced?\n\nLooking for clusters not connected to the central cross.\n\nThe 2s are in rows1-2, columns0-2. Are they connected to the cross? The cross's column3 in row1-2 is 5. So the 2s are in column0-2, row1-2. Are they adjacent to column3 (which is 5 in those rows)? In row1, column3 is 5, which is adjacent to column2. So the 2s in column2 are adjacent to 5. So the 2 cluster is connected to the cross, so they are not replaced.\n\nThe 6s in row0-2, columns7-8. In row0, column3 is 5. The 6s are in column7, which is four columns away. So not connected. So the 6 cluster (rows0-2, columns7-8) is not connected to the cross. So according to previous hypothesis, they should be replaced by 5.\n\nThe 3s are in rows4-5, column5-6. Are they connected to the cross? The central cross is column3, rows0-3. The 3s are in row4-5, which are below row3. Not adjacent. So the 3 cluster is not connected and should be replaced by5.\n\nThe 8s are in rows6-7, columns0-2. Not connected to cross. Should be replaced by5.\n\nThe 4s are in rows6-8, column8. Not connected to cross. Replaced by5.\n\nThe 7s are in rows8-9, columns4-6. Not connected. Replaced by5.\n\nBut in previous examples, only some clusters are replaced. For example, in example0, the 6s and 7s (lower part) are replaced. The upper 7s are not. So perhaps the clusters that are in certain positions (like lower part) are replaced. But how to determine which ones.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is to replace the rightmost cluster. For example, in example0, the rightmost cluster is the 6s and 7s in the lower right. In example1, the rightmost cluster is the 9s in the lower right. In example2, the rightmost cluster is the 1s in the upper right. All replaced with5.\n\nIn the test input, the rightmost clusters are the 6s (columns7-8), 3s (column5-6), 4s (column8), and 7s (columns4-6). The rightmost would be the 4s in column8 and 6s in column7-8. So perhaps the rightmost cluster is replaced with5. But example0's replaced cluster was in columns5-7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the cluster that is furthest to the right is replaced with5. In example0, the replaced clusters are the 6s and 7s in columns5-7. In example1, the 9s are in column8-9. In example2, the 1s are in column7-8. So rightmost cluster. So the pattern is: replace the rightmost cluster (the cluster with the highest column number) with5.\n\nSo applying this to the test input. The clusters are:\n\n- 2s in columns0-2.\n\n- 6s in columns7-8.\n\n- 3s in columns5-6.\n\n- 8s in columns0-2.\n\n- 4s in column8.\n\n- 7s in columns4-6.\n\nThe rightmost cluster is the 4s in column8 (rows6-8). So replacing them with5. Also the 6s in columns7-8. Are they the rightmost? The 6s are in columns7-8, rows0-2. The 4s are in column8, rows6-8. So the 4s are the farthest right. So according to this hypothesis, the 4s would be replaced with5. Also the 6s? Because their cluster is in column7-8.\n\nIn the training examples:\n\nExample0's rightmost cluster was the 6s in columns5-7 and 7s in column7. So replaced with5.\n\nExample1's rightmost cluster was 9s in column8-9. Replaced with5.\n\nExample2's rightmost cluster was 1s in column7-8. Replaced with5.\n\nSo according to this pattern, the rightmost cluster (highest column numbers) in the input is replaced with5. So in the test input, the rightmost clusters are the 4s in column8 and the 6s in columns7-8. Which one is furthest right? The 4s are in column8, which is the same as the 6s' column8. But the 6s are in columns7-8. The 4s are in column8. So the 4s are the furthest right, so their cluster is replaced with5.\n\nBut also, the 6s are in columns7-8. So their cluster is in column7-8. Which is also far right. So perhaps both clusters are replaced. But in previous examples, only one cluster was replaced. For example, in example0, the 6s and 7s in lower right were replaced. But according to this hypothesis, perhaps only the rightmost cluster is replaced.\n\nBut in the test input, there are multiple clusters in the same rightmost column. For example, the 6s in column7-8 (rows0-2), and the 4s in column8 (rows6-8). Which is the rightmost? Both are in column8. The 4s are in column8, rows6-8. The 6s are in columns7-8, rows0-2. So the 4s are in column8, which is the highest. But how to determine if they are considered as separate clusters or part of the same. Since they are separate (not connected), each is its own cluster. So the rightmost clusters would be all clusters in column8, but since they are separate, the largest one? Or the southernmost?\n\nAlternatively, the rightmost cluster (highest column) is the one in the lowest row. For example, in the test input, the 4s are in column8, rows6-8. The 6s are in column8, rows0-2. The 4s are in lower rows, so their cluster is the rightmost and lowest. So according to some priority (rightmost, then lowest), the 4s would be replaced. But in example0, the replaced cluster was in lower rows. Maybe the rule is to replace the rightmost and lowest cluster.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's look at the training examples again.\n\nExample0: The replaced cluster is in columns5-7, rows5-7. The rightmost in that area. The cluster is the 6s and 7s. But the rightmost cluster would be the 7s in columns7. But perhaps in example0, the replaced cluster is the 6s and 7s in the lower part. So maybe the rightmost cluster in the lower half of the grid.\n\nExample1: The replaced cluster is in columns8-9, rows7-8. Rightmost and lower.\n\nExample2: The replaced cluster is in columns7-8, rows0-1. Rightmost upper.\n\nSo the pattern isn't clear. However, all replaced clusters are the rightmost in their respective grids. So the pattern is to replace the rightmost cluster (the one with the highest column number) with 5.\n\nIn the test input, the rightmost clusters are the 4s in column8 and the 6s in columns7-8. Since the 4s are in column8 (highest), their cluster is the rightmost. So replace 4s with5.\n\nAdditionally, the 6s are in columns7-8. But since column8 is higher than 7, the 4s' cluster is the rightmost. So only the 4s would be replaced.\n\nLooking at the test input's clusters:\n\nThe 4s are in rows6-8, column8. In the input, those are three cells. Replaced with5.\n\nThe 6s are in rows0-2, columns7-8. Not replaced.\n\nThe 3s are in rows4-5, columns5-6. Replaced?\n\nWait, but according to the training examples, only the rightmost cluster is replaced. So in example0, the 6s and 7s (rightmost) are replaced. In example1, the 9s (rightmost) are replaced. In example2, the 1s (rightmost) are replaced.\n\nSo in the test input, the rightmost cluster is the 4s in column8, so they should be replaced with5.\n\nOther clusters like the 3s (columns5-6), 7s (columns4-6), 8s (columns0-2), and 6s (columns7-8) are not the rightmost, so they remain.\n\nBut wait, the 6s are in column7-8, which is rightmost except for column8. The 6s in columns7-8 are part of columns7-8, but the 4s are in column8, which is the highest. So the 4s' cluster is the rightmost.\n\nSo the output for the test input should replace all 4s with5.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe 4s are in row6, column8: 4.\n\nRow7, column8:4.\n\nRow8, column8:4.\n\nSo replacing those with5.\n\nOther clusters remain.\n\nSo the test output would have those 4s changed to5.\n\nBut let's check the other examples. For instance, example0's output replaced multiple clusters (6s and 7s) in the lower part. So perhaps there's more to the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace the rightmost and uppermost cluster. Or the first rightmost cluster encountered.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the rightmost cluster is replaced with5.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nThe rightmost cluster is the 4s in column8. Replacing them with5.\n\nOther clusters remain.\n\nSo the output for the test input would have 5s where the 4s were.\n\nLooking at the test input's rows:\n\nRow6: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nRow7: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,7,7,7,0,4,0]\n\nIn the output, these 4s would become5.\n\nAlso, the 3s are in rows4-6, column5-6. Not the rightmost, so they remain 3s.\n\nThe 6s in rows0-2, columns7-8 are not the rightmost (the 4s are), so they remain 6s.\n\nThe 7s in rows8-9, columns4-6 are not the rightmost, so they remain 7s.\n\nThe 8s in rows6-7, columns0-2 are not the rightmost, so they remain 8s.\n\nThe 2s in rows1-2, columns0-2 are not the rightmost, so remain 2s.\n\nSo the final output would have the 4s replaced with5.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern in the training examples that transforms the input into the output, and then apply that to the test input. Let's start by carefully analyzing the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0 first. The input and output are mostly the same, except for some changes. For instance, in the input's sixth row (index 5), there's [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], which in the output becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]. Similarly, the next row in the input has 7s and 6s that turn into 5s. So, the 6 and 7 in those positions are replaced with 5. Wait, but why 5? Let me check the original input. The original input has a 5 in the fourth column of the first three rows, and the fourth row is all 5s. Maybe there's a connection here.\n\nIn Example 1, the output changes some 9s to 5s. In the input's row 7 (index 7), the 9 in position [7][8] becomes 5, and the next row's 9s become 5s. So again, a number (9) is being replaced by 5. But why 5? Looking at the input, the fourth row has a 5 in the fourth column. Maybe the central 5 in the grid is the key here. The fourth row (index 3) in all examples seems to have all 5s. Like in Example 0, row 3 is all 5s. Similarly in Example 1, row 3 is all 5s. And in Example 2's input, row 3 is also all 5s. So maybe the 5s in row 3 are significant.\n\nThe pattern might be that any number that is part of a group (like clusters of the same number) that is not connected to the central 5 (which is the fourth row, all 5s) gets replaced by 5. Wait, but in Example 0, the 6 and 7 in the lower part are being replaced by 5. How are they connected? Let me check their positions. In Example 0's input, the 6 is in row 5 (index 5), columns 5 and 6. The 7s are in rows 6 and 7. These are in the lower part, maybe not connected to the central 5s. But how are they determined to be replaced?\n\nAlternatively, maybe any number that is part of a shape (like a cluster) that is not adjacent to the central 5s (row 3) is changed to 5. Let me check Example 0's 6 cluster. The 6s in row 5 are [5,5] and [5,6]. Then in row 6, columns 6 and 7 are 6. So the 6s form a sort of L-shape. Are they adjacent to the 5s in row 3? Row 3 is all 5s. The 6s are several rows below, maybe not directly connected. So maybe those clusters not connected to the central 5s are replaced by 5.\n\nIn Example 1, the 7s in row 6 (columns 2-4) are replaced? Wait, in the output of Example 1, the 7s in row 6 remain 7. But the 9s in rows 7 and 8 are replaced by 5. So perhaps clusters that are not adjacent to the central 5 are turned into 5. The 9s are in the bottom right. The central 5s are in row 3, so those 9s are not connected. So they get changed to 5. Similarly, in Example 2, the 1s in row 0 and 1 are replaced with 5s. Wait, in Example 2's input, the original 1s are in row 0 and 1, column 7-9. Then in the output, those become 5. The central 5 is row 3. So those 1s are not connected, so they become 5.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: any cluster of numbers (connected regions of the same number) that are not connected to the central 5s (row 3) are changed to 5. Connectedness here probably means adjacent (including diagonally or just orthogonally? Let's check the examples).\n\nIn Example 0, the 6 and 7 clusters are replaced. Let's see if they are connected to the central 5. The central 5s are in row 3. The 6 cluster is in row 5, which is two rows below. Are they connected via any path? The 5s in row 3 are in columns 0-3. The 6 cluster is in row 5, columns 5-6. So no direct connection. Similarly, the 7 cluster in rows 0-2, column 7. The central 5s are in row 3. So the 7s in row 0-2 are in column 7. The 5s in row 3 are columns 0-3. So no connection. So these clusters are replaced by 5.\n\nIn Example 1, the 9 cluster in rows 7-8, column 8-9. The central 5s are row 3. So no connection. Thus replaced by 5.\n\nIn Example 2, the original 1 cluster in rows 0-1, columns 7-9. The central 5s are row 3. Not connected. So replaced by 5.\n\nSo the rule is: any contiguous region (cluster) of the same number that is not connected to the central 5s (row 3, which is all 5s) is changed to 5. The connection is probably via adjacent cells (orthogonal or diagonal), but let's verify.\n\nHow are clusters connected? Let's see in Example 0, the central 5s are in row 3. The 5s in the first three rows (row 0-2, column 3) are connected to row 3 via row 3's 5s. For example, in row 0, column 3 is 5, which is adjacent to row 1, column 3 (5 in input?), wait wait, in Example 0's input, the first three rows have 5 in column 3. For example, row 0: [1,1,0,5,...], row 1: [0,1,1,5,...], row 2: [0,0,1,5,...]. Then row 3 is all 5s. So the 5 in row 0, column 3 is adjacent to row 1's 5 in column 3, and that connects down to row 3. So those 5s are part of the central cluster. So any 5s that are connected to the central row 3's 5s remain as 5. Other numbers' clusters that are not connected are changed to 5.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's output, some 5s are present in the upper part. For example, in the input's row 0-2, column 3 is 5. Those are connected to the central 5s, so they stay. But the 6s and 7s in the input are not connected to the central 5s, so they become 5 in the output.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each cell, if it's part of a connected region (cluster) that is not connected to the central 5s (row 3, columns 0-9 all 5s), then replace that region's number with 5. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nNow, in the test input, we need to identify which clusters are connected to the central 5s. The central 5s are in row 3, which is all 5s. So any 5 in the input that is connected to row 3's 5s remains 5. Other clusters (like the 2s, 3s, 6s, 8s, 7s, 4s) need to be checked if they are connected.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,6,0,0] \u2013 the 5 in column 3 is connected to row 1's 5? Let's see. The input's row 1: [2,2,2,5,...]. So the 5 in row 0, column 3 is connected to row 1's column 3 (5), which connects down to row 3's 5s. So that 5 is part of the central cluster.\n\nIn row 3, all 5s. So any 5 connected via adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, maybe diagonally) to row 3's 5s would remain. Let's check other numbers.\n\nFor example, the 2s in row 1 and 2: [2,2,2,5,...] and [0,0,2,5,...]. The 2s are in columns 0-2 of rows 1 and 2. Are these connected to the central 5s? The 5 in row 1, column 3 is part of the central cluster. The 2s are in the same row but adjacent to the 5. Wait, but the 2s are in row 1, columns 0-2. The 5 is in column 3. Are they adjacent? Yes, in row 1, column 2 is 2, column 3 is 5. So the 2 cluster is adjacent to the central 5 cluster. So according to the pattern, would that 2 cluster be replaced? But in the training examples, the clusters not connected were replaced. So if a cluster is adjacent to the central 5 cluster, it's connected and remains. If not, it's replaced.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 6 cluster was not adjacent to the 5 cluster. So in the test input, the 2 cluster is adjacent to the 5 cluster (since in row 1, column 3 is 5 and column 2 is 2). So the 2 cluster is adjacent. Therefore, they would not be replaced. So they stay as 2.\n\nThen, what about the 6s in row 0, column 7 and row 1, columns 7-8. Let's see. The 6s are in row 0, column 7 (6), row 1 columns 7-8 (6 and 6), row 2 column 7 (6). These form a cluster. Are they connected to the central 5s? The central 5s are in row 3. The 6 cluster is in rows 0-2, columns 7-8. The central 5s are in row 3, columns 0-9. So the 6 cluster is not adjacent to the 5 cluster. Because row 3's 5s are in all columns, but the 6 cluster is in rows 0-2, columns 7-8. The closest 5s would be in row 3, columns 7-8. The 6 in row 2, column 7 is adjacent (down) to row 3, column 7's 5. So the 6 cluster is adjacent to the 5 cluster. Therefore, the 6s are connected and should not be replaced.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the 7 cluster in rows 0-2, column 7. The 5 cluster is in row 3. The 7s are in row 0, column 7. The 5s are in row 3, column 7. Are they connected? Let's see: in Example 0's input, the 7 in row 0, column 7 is in row 0. Then row 3 has 5 in column 7. So between them are rows 1 and 2. Row 1, column 7 is 7 (input row 1: [0,1,1,5,0,0,7,7,7,0]). Row 2, column 7 is 7. So the 7 cluster is in rows 0-2, column 7. The 5 cluster is in row 3. So the 7s are adjacent to the 5s. For example, row 2's 7 in column 7 is directly above row 3's 5 in column 7. So they are adjacent (vertically). So in Example 0, the 7 cluster is adjacent to the central 5 cluster, but in the output, the 7s are changed to 5. Wait, that contradicts the previous idea.\n\nWait in Example 0's input, the 7s are in rows 0-2, column 7. The 5s are in row 3, column 0-9. So in row 3, column 7 is 5. The 7 in row 2, column 7 is directly above the 5 in row 3, column 7. So they are adjacent (vertically). So the 7 cluster is connected to the 5 cluster, but in the output, those 7s are changed to 5. Wait that's conflicting. Because according to the previous logic, if the cluster is connected to the central 5s, it's left as is. But in Example 0's output, the 7s in the input's rows 0-2 are replaced with 5 in the output. Wait no, looking back at Example 0's input and output:\n\nExample 0's input for the first three rows:\n\nInput:\nRow0: [1,1,0,5,0,0,0,7,0,0]\nRow1: [0,1,1,5,0,0,7,7,7,0]\nRow2: [0,0,1,5,0,0,0,7,0,0]\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\nRow0: [1,1,0,5,0,0,0,7,0,0]\nRow1: [0,1,1,5,0,0,7,7,7,0]\nRow2: [0,0,1,5,0,0,0,7,0,0]\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, in the output, the 7s are still present. Oh wait, no, looking again at the output for Example 0:\n\nWait, the output's sixth row (index 5) is [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0], which was originally 6. But the 7s in the first three rows are still present. So the 7 cluster in rows 0-2, column7-8 is connected to the central 5s (since row3, column7 is 0 in the input. Wait, wait, wait. In Example 0's input, row3 is [5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So columns 0-3 are 5, columns 4-9 are 0. So the 5s in row3 are only in columns 0-3. Oh! So in Example 0, the central 5 cluster is row3, columns 0-3. So the 7 cluster in column7 is not adjacent to the central 5 cluster. Because the 5s are in columns 0-3 of row3. The 7 cluster is in column7 of rows 0-2. So they are not adjacent. Therefore, the 7 cluster is not connected to the central 5 cluster, hence replaced with 5 in the output. Wait, but in the output of Example 0, the 7s in rows 0-2, column7 are still present. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nOriginal input for Example 0:\n\nINPUT: \nRow0: [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]\nRow1: [0, 1, 1, 5, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]\nRow2: [0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]\nRow3: [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n...\nOUTPUT: same as input for these rows. Wait, the output for rows 0-3 in Example0 is the same as input. The changes are in rows 5,6,7:\n\nInput row5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [7,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,0] becomes [7,7,7,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0] becomes [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nAh, I see. So the 6s in rows 5-7 are replaced with 5s. The 7s in row6 and 7 are part of the same cluster. Wait, but the 7s in row0-2 are still present. Why aren't those 7s replaced? Because perhaps the central 5 cluster is not row3, but a different part. Wait, maybe the central 5 cluster is the entire row3 (all 5s). But in Example0's input, row3 has 5s only in columns 0-3. So maybe the central cluster is the entire row3, but in this case, row3 is not all 5s. Wait, looking at the input for Example0:\n\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So columns 0-3 are 5, and the rest 0. So the central 5 cluster is columns 0-3 of row3. So any cluster connected to that part would remain, others are replaced.\n\nSo in Example0, the 7s in rows0-2, column7 are not connected to the central 5 cluster (columns 0-3 of row3). The 6s in rows5-7, columns5-7 are also not connected. So those clusters are replaced with 5. The 7s in rows6-7 (like row6's 7s) are part of a cluster that's adjacent to the central 5 cluster? No, because row6's 7s are in columns0-2. The central 5 cluster is in row3, columns0-3. So row6's 7s are columns0-2, which are in row6, which is three rows below row3. Are there any connecting 5s? The row3's 5s are in columns0-3. The 7s in row6 are in columns0-2. Are there any 5s between row3 and row6? Looking at row4: all zeros. Row5: all zeros except columns5-6. So the 7s in row6 are not connected to the central 5 cluster, hence they are replaced with 5. Wait, but in Example0's output, the 7s in rows6-7 (rows6: [7,7,7,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]) \u2013 wait, in the input, row6's 7s are columns0-2. In the output, they remain as 7. But in the input, row6 also has 6s in columns6-7, which become 5s. So why are the 7s in row6 not replaced?\n\nAh, this suggests that the pattern is not just about being connected to the central 5 cluster, but perhaps something else. Let me re-examine Example0's input and output.\n\nIn Example0's input, the 7s in row0-2, column7 are part of a cluster. Are they connected to any 5s? The 5s in row0-2 are in column3. For example, in row0, column3 is 5. So the 5 in row0, column3 is part of the central 5 cluster (row3, columns0-3). So perhaps the 5s in row0-3 form a connected region. Let me see:\n\nRow0's column3 is 5, row1's column3 is 5, row2's column3 is 5, row3's columns0-3 are 5. So these 5s are connected vertically and in row3's columns0-3. So the 5 cluster includes these cells. Now, the 7s in rows0-2, column7 are not connected to any 5s. So they form their own cluster, which is not connected to the central 5 cluster. But in the output, they are not replaced. Wait, but according to the output, these 7s remain. So why aren't they replaced?\n\nThis is conflicting. Because according to the previous examples, the clusters not connected to the central 5 are replaced. But in Example0, the 7s in rows0-2, column7 are not connected to the central 5 cluster, yet they remain.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the pattern isn't as straightforward as replacing all clusters not connected to the central 5. So perhaps I need to re-examine the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example0's input and output:\n\nIn the input, the 7s in rows0-2, column7 are present. In the output, they are still present. However, the 7s in row6 (columns0-2) are replaced with 5. Wait, no: in the input of Example0, row6 is [7,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,0], and the output is [7,7,7,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]. So the 7s in row6 are kept, but the 6s in columns6-7 are replaced with 5.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let's list all changes in Example0:\n\nInput rows (only the ones that change):\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0] \u2192 Output: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [7,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,0] \u2192 [7,7,7,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]\n\nRow7: [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nSo the 6s are replaced with 5s. The 7s in row6 and row7 (the one in row7, column2) are kept as 7.\n\nSo why are these 7s kept? Let's check if they are part of the central 5 cluster.\n\nThe 7s in row6, columns0-2: are they connected to the central 5 cluster? The central 5 cluster is row3, columns0-3. The 7s in row6, columns0-2. To connect to the central 5 cluster, there must be a path of adjacent 5s. Let's see:\n\nBetween row3 and row6, rows4 and 5 are all zeros (except row5's 6s, which are replaced). So no 5s. So the 7s in row6 are not connected to the central 5 cluster. So why aren't they replaced? But they are kept as 7. This contradicts the initial hypothesis.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not based on connection to the central 5 cluster. So what's the actual pattern here?\n\nLooking at the other training examples.\n\nIn Example1's input, the 9s in rows7-8, columns8-9 are replaced with 5. The central 5s are in row3. The 9 cluster is not connected to the 5s. The 7s in row6, columns2-4 remain as 7. Are they connected? The 7s are in row6. The central 5s are row3. No connection, but they remain. So why are some clusters replaced and others not?\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that clusters are replaced if they are below a certain row. For example, in Example0, the 6 and 7 clusters in rows5-7 are replaced, but the upper 7s are not. But in Example0, the upper 7s are in rows0-2. In Example1, the 9s are in rows7-8, which are lower. Maybe the clusters in the lower half are replaced with 5s. But how to define lower half?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the central row (row3) is a separator. Any cluster in rows below row3 (rows4-9) that are not connected to the central 5s are replaced with 5. Clusters above row3 (rows0-2) are not replaced. But in Example0, the upper 7s are in rows0-2. So they would not be replaced, which matches the output. The 6 and 7 in rows5-7 are replaced. Wait, but in Example0, the 7s in row6 are kept. Wait, no: in row6 of Example0's output, the 7s are kept. So this contradicts that hypothesis.\n\nHmm. Let's look for another pattern. Let's check the numbers that are replaced. In Example0, the 6 and 7 in rows5-7 are replaced. The 6s become 5, and the 7 in row7 becomes 5. Wait, row6's 7s are kept. So why is that? Let me check row6's input and output again.\n\nInput row6: [7,7,7,0,0,0,6,6,0,0]\n\nOutput row6: [7,7,7,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]\n\nSo the 7s are kept, the 6s are replaced with 5. So it's the 6 cluster that's replaced, but the 7s in the same row are kept. So the replacement depends on the number's cluster, not the location.\n\nBut why are the 6s replaced but not the 7s in the same row? Because the 6 cluster is not connected to the central 5 cluster, but the 7 cluster is connected to the central 5 cluster? How?\n\nThe 7s in row6, columns0-2. Are they connected to the central 5s? The central 5s are in row3, columns0-3. Let's see if there's a path. Between row3 and row6: rows4-5 are zeros except for the 6s in row5, which are replaced. So no path. So the 7s in row6 are not connected to the central 5s, but they are not replaced. So this breaks the previous pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the numbers that are replaced are those that are not present in the central row (row3). The central row has 5s. So any number that is not 5 and forms a cluster not connected to the central 5s is replaced with 5. But in Example0, the 6 and 7 are not 5 and their clusters are not connected. But the 7s in row6 are kept. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers (like 6, 7, 9) with 5, but this is arbitrary. But looking at the examples:\n\nExample0: 6 and 7 are replaced with 5 in certain clusters.\n\nExample1: 9 is replaced with 5.\n\nExample2: 1 is replaced with5.\n\nSo the replaced numbers vary. So it's not a fixed number.\n\nAnother idea: the numbers that are replaced are the ones that form clusters that are surrounded by 0s and are not connected to the central 5s. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, the output seems to have the same structure as the input, but certain clusters are replaced with 5. The clusters replaced are those that are islands not connected to the central 5s. But in Example0, the 7s in row6 are not connected to the central 5s but are kept. So why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any cluster of a number that is not present in the central row (row3) is replaced with 5. Since the central row in all examples has only 5s (except row3 in Example0's input, which has 5s in columns0-3 and 0s elsewhere), then any cluster of numbers other than 5 are replaced if they are not present in the central row. But in Example0, the central row has 5s. So any number not 5 would be replaced. But in Example0's input, there are 1s, 5s, 6s,7s,8s. The 6s and 7s are replaced, but the 1s and 8s are not. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, in Example0's output, the 1s in rows0-2 are kept. So the 1s are not in the central row (row3). So why aren't they replaced?\n\nThis suggests that the pattern isn't based on whether the number exists in the central row.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the positions of the clusters that are replaced.\n\nIn Example0, the 6s are in the lower part (rows5-7) and are replaced. The 7s in the lower part (row6-7) are replaced. But the 7s in the upper part (rows0-2) are kept.\n\nIn Example1, the 9s in the lower part (rows7-8) are replaced.\n\nIn Example2, the 1s in the upper part (rows0-1) are replaced.\n\nSo it's not strictly about lower or upper part.\n\nHmm. This is getting tricky. Let's think of another approach. Perhaps the pattern is to replace every other cluster with 5, starting from the bottom or top. Or maybe the first cluster encountered is replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of clusters: replace the largest cluster not connected to the central 5s.\n\nBut in Example0, the replaced 6 and 7 clusters may be smaller than the 8 cluster, which is not replaced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to replace clusters that are \"floating\" and not anchored to the central 5s.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is to replace any cluster that is not part of the central 5's connected region. So for each cell, if it's part of a cluster that is connected to the central 5s (row3), it remains; otherwise, it's replaced with 5.\n\nBut in Example0's input, the 1s in rows0-2, columns0-2 are not connected to the central 5s. Are they replaced? In the output, they are kept. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, Example0's output keeps the 1s and 5s in the upper rows. So why are the 1s not replaced? Because they are connected to the central 5s? How?\n\nThe 1s in row0-2 are adjacent to the 5s in column3. For example, in row0, the 1s are in columns0-1, and the 5 is in column3. Are they connected via adjacent cells? The 1s in row0, column0-1 are adjacent to the 5 in column3 via row0's column2 (0), so no. So the 1 cluster is not connected to the central 5 cluster. But they are not replaced. So this pattern is invalid.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find another approach. Perhaps the pattern is that any cluster that is connected to the bottom row (row9) is replaced. No, in Example0, the 8s in rows8-9 are not replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the clusters that are in the same row or column as the central 5s are kept, others replaced. No, because in Example0, the 1s are not in the same row or column as the central 5s.\n\nAnother idea: the central 5s form a cross or a certain shape, and clusters touching that shape are kept. Or perhaps the central 5s form a \"+\" shape, and clusters touching the arms of the \"+\" are kept.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all clusters except those that are part of the central 5s and any clusters directly connected to them. But in Example0, the 1s are not connected but are kept.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the difference between input and output in the examples.\n\nIn Example0, the only changes are the 6 and 7 clusters in rows5-7. Let's check their positions. The 6s are in rows5-7, columns5-7. The 7s in rows6-7, columns0-2. The central 5s are in row3, columns0-3. So these clusters are not connected to the central 5s. But why are only those replaced?\n\nSimilarly, in Example1, the 9s in rows7-8 are replaced. The central 5s are row3. So the 9 cluster is not connected. So replaced.\n\nIn Example2, the 1s in rows0-1, column7 are replaced with 5. Those are not connected to the central 5s. So replaced.\n\nSo why are these clusters replaced and others not?\n\nLooking at Example0, the 1s in rows0-2, columns0-2 are not replaced. But they are not connected to the central 5s. So why?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any cluster that is adjacent to the central 5 cluster is kept. But the 1s are not adjacent. So why are they kept?\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that clusters are replaced if they are completely surrounded by zeros, but that's not the case.\n\nAnother possibility: the replacement happens to clusters that are not part of a \"digit\" shape. Like, perhaps the puzzle is about forming numbers, and certain digits are replaced. But this seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to replace any cluster that is surrounded by zeros on all four sides, but again, this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is to replace clusters that are not connected to the central 5 cluster and are located in certain quadrants. For example, the right side or left side.\n\nIn Example0, the replaced clusters are on the right and left. The 6s are on the right, and the 7s on the left. But why are some replaced and others not?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to clusters that are in the same row or column as the central 5s but not connected. This doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's try to look for a different approach. Maybe the pattern is that any cluster that is not part of the largest cluster (or the central cluster) is replaced with 5. But how to determine the largest.\n\nAlternatively, the central 5 cluster is the largest, and other clusters are replaced. But the 8 cluster in Example0's rows8-9 is not replaced. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's try to find another angle. Let's compare the input and output for each example and see what's changed.\n\nIn Example0, the changes are:\n\n- In row5, columns5-6: 6 \u2192 5.\n\n- In row6, columns6-7: 6 \u2192 5.\n\n- In row7, column7:6 \u21925.\n\nAdditionally, in row7, column2:7 \u21925. Wait, no. Let's check row7's input and output:\n\nInput row7: [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0]\n\nOutput row7: [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nSo only the 6 is replaced with 5, the 7 remains.\n\nSo the replaced clusters are the 6s in rows5-7 and the 7 in row6 (but the 7s in row6 are kept as 7). Wait, no. In row6's input, the 7s are columns0-2 and remain 7. The 6s in columns6-7 are replaced.\n\nSo in Example0, the replaced clusters are the 6s and the 7 in row7, column2 (but it's not a cluster? Or maybe it's part of a larger cluster). Wait, row6's 7s are columns0-2. Row7's 7 is column2. So that's part of the same cluster. So the 7 cluster is from row6, columns0-2 and row7, column2. So why is only row7's 7 replaced? No, in the output, row7's 7 is kept as 7, but the 6 is replaced. So the 7 in row7, column2 is part of the 7 cluster that is connected to the 7s in row6. But in the output, they are kept as 7.\n\nThis suggests that the 6 clusters are replaced, but the 7 clusters are not. So perhaps the rule is to replace clusters of certain numbers. But in Example0, 6 and 7 are replaced. Example1, 9 is replaced. Example2, 1 is replaced. So the replaced numbers are 6,7,9,1. No obvious pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, the replaced numbers are those that are not present in the central 5 cluster. But the central 5 cluster has 5s. So any number other than 5 may be replaced if not connected. But in Example0, the 1s, 7s, and 8s are not 5 but are not replaced. So this isn't the case.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by replacing all occurrences of the digit that appears in the fourth row (row3) with 5. But in the fourth row, the digits are all 5. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to replace any cluster that is not part of the central 5 cluster and is not adjacent to the edges of the grid. But in Example0, the 6 cluster is near the middle, but replaced.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to see if there's a numerical pattern. For example, the sum of the numbers in the cluster, or their position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to replace the cluster with the number that is the row index of the central cluster (row3 is 5?), but that's not clear.\n\nWait, all the replaced clusters in the examples are replaced with 5. The central row (row3) is all 5s (or part of it). So maybe the rule is to replace clusters not connected to the central 5s with 5.\n\nBut then why are some clusters not connected to the central 5s not replaced?\n\nFor example, in Example0's input, the 7s in rows0-2, column7 are not connected to the central 5s. But they are not replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in Example0's output, those 7s are still present. So why are they not replaced? That's a problem for the hypothesis.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the replacement happens only to clusters that are in the same row or column as the central 5s. But the 6s in Example0 are in rows5-7, columns5-7. The central 5s are in row3, columns0-3. So they are in different columns. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe clusters that are connected to the bottom of the grid are replaced. But in Example0, the 8 cluster in rows8-9 is not replaced.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to think of another approach. Let's look at the numbers that are replaced in the examples and their positions:\n\nIn Example0:\n\n- The 6 cluster (rows5-7, columns5-7) \u2192 replaced with 5.\n\n- The 7 cluster in row7, column7 (part of the 6 cluster?) No, the 7s are in row6 and row7, column2 and column7. Maybe not. It's unclear.\n\nIn Example1:\n\n- The 9 cluster (rows7-8, column8-9) \u2192 replaced with 5.\n\nIn Example2:\n\n- The 1 cluster (rows0-1, column7-9) \u2192 replaced with 5.\n\nSo in all cases, the replaced clusters are not connected to the central 5 cluster. However, in Example0, the 7s in rows0-2, column7 are not connected to the central 5s but are not replaced. So why?\n\nWait, maybe the central 5 cluster is not just row3, but the entire 5 cluster. In Example0, the 5s in row3 are only in columns0-3. So the central 5 cluster is row3's 5s. The 5s in rows0-2, column3 are connected to row3's 5s. So those 5s are part of the central cluster. The 7s in rows0-2, column7 are not connected. But they are not replaced. So why?\n\nAh, maybe the rule is that any cluster that is not connected to the central 5 cluster and is not adjacent to the edge of the grid is replaced. For example, in Example0's 6 cluster is in the middle, not adjacent to the edges. The 7 cluster in rows0-2, column7 is adjacent to the right edge. So they are not replaced. But this is just a guess.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample0's replaced 6 cluster is in the middle, not touching edges. The 7 cluster in row6 is touching the left edge. But those 7s are not replaced. So this hypothesis doesn't hold.\n\nAnother possibility: clusters that are surrounded by zeros are replaced. But the 6 cluster in Example0 is surrounded by zeros except for the 7 cluster nearby.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to replace clusters that are in the same row as the central 5 cluster but not connected. But the central 5 cluster is in row3. The 6 cluster is in row5-7.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to look for another angle.\n\nLooking at the examples, the central row (row3) is all 5s or part 5s. In all examples, row3 has 5s. The output changes certain clusters to 5. So maybe the rule is that any cluster that is connected to the central 5s remains, and others are replaced with 5.\n\nBut in Example0, the 7s in rows0-2, column7 are not connected to the central 5s but are not replaced. So this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is that clusters that are connected to the central 5s via their own number's path are kept. For example, if a cluster of 7s is connected to the central 5s via a path of 7s, but that's not possible since the central 5s are 5s.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to replace all clusters except those that form a certain shape. For example, in Example0, the 1s form a diagonal shape.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is to replace clusters that are made of even numbers, but in Example0, 6 and 7 (6 is even, 7 odd). Example1: 9 (odd). Example2: 1 (odd). So that's not it.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that any cluster of a number that is not present in the same position in the central row (row3) is replaced. For example, in Example0's row3 has 5s in columns0-3. So any cluster in columns0-3 may be kept. But this doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the clusters that are in columns that have 5s in row3 are kept. In Example0, row3's 5s are in columns0-3. So clusters in columns0-3 are kept. The 1s in Example0's input are in columns0-2, so they are in columns0-3, hence kept. The 7s in column7 are not in columns0-3, so replaced. But in Example0's input, the 7s in column7 are not replaced. So this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: the pattern is to replace clusters that are in columns to the right of the central 5 cluster. For example, in Example0, the central 5s are in columns0-3. So any cluster in columns4-9 may be replaced. The 6 and 7 clusters are in columns5-7, so replaced. The 8 cluster is in columns4-7 of rows8-9. But in Example0's output, the 8s are not replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, clusters that are in the same columns as the central 5s are kept. The 1s in Example0 are in columns0-2, which are part of the central 5's columns (0-3). So they are kept. The 7s in column7 are not, so replaced. But in Example0's output, the 7s are not replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern there that matches the examples.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,6,0,0]\nRow1: [2,2,2,5,0,0,0,6,6,0]\nRow2: [0,0,2,5,0,0,0,6,0,0]\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,0,3,0,0,0,0]\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0]\nRow6: [8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\nRow7: [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,7,7,7,0,4,0]\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]\n\nCentral row is row3: all 5s in columns0-3, and 0s elsewhere except column5 has 3.\n\nAccording to the previous examples, any cluster not connected to the central 5s should be replaced with 5.\n\nSo in the test input:\n\nClusters to check:\n\n- The 2 cluster in rows1-2, columns0-2. This is adjacent to the 5 in column3 of rows1-2. So connected to the central 5s. So not replaced.\n\n- The 6 cluster in rows0-2, columns7-8. Are they connected to the central 5s? The 6s are in column7, rows0-2. The central 5s are in column3. Are there any path connecting them? No. So this cluster is not connected and should be replaced with 5.\n\n- The 3 cluster in rows3-5, columns5-6. This is adjacent to the central 5s (row3's column5 is 3). So the 3s are in row3, column5. Are they connected to the central 5s (row3, columns0-3). No. So the 3 cluster is not connected to the central 5s. So replaced with 5.\n\n- The 8 cluster in rows6-7, columns0-2. Are they connected to the central 5s? The central 5s are in row3, columns0-3. The 8 cluster is in row6-7, columns0-2. Are there any 5s between row3 and row6? No. So not connected. Replaced with 5.\n\n- The 4 cluster in rows6-8, column8. Connected to central 5s? No. So replaced with 5.\n\n- The 7 cluster in rows8-9, columns4-6. Connected to central 5s? No. So replaced with 5.\n\nApplying this, the test output would have:\n\n- 6s in rows0-2, columns7-8 \u2192 5.\n\n- 3s in rows3-5, columns5-6 \u21925.\n\n- 8s in rows6-7, columns0-2 \u21925.\n\n- 4s in rows6-8, column8 \u21925.\n\n- 7s in rows8-9, columns4-6 \u21925.\n\nLet's check what the expected output would be.\n\nFor example, row0's 6s in column7 would become 5. So row0: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nRow1's 6s in columns7-8 become 5: [2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nRow2's 6 in column7 becomes 5: [0,0,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nRow3: The 3 in column5 becomes 5? Wait, row3's input is [5,5,5,5,0,3,0,0,0,0]. The 3 in column5 is part of the 3 cluster. So in the output, this would become 5. So row3 becomes [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0]. But wait, row3's 3 is in column5, which is not part of the central 5 cluster. So the 3 in row3 is part of the 3 cluster. So in the output, the 3s would be replaced with 5.\n\nSimilarly, row4's 3 in column5 becomes 5.\n\nRow5's 3s become 5s: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow6's 8s become 5: [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow7's 8 becomes 5: [5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow8's 7s become 5: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow9's 7 becomes 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nBut let's check the training examples to see if this aligns. In Example0, the 6s in rows5-7 were replaced. But the central 5s in row3 were not changed. So in the test input, the 3 in row3, column5 would be replaced with 5.\n\nSo applying this, the test output would be:\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nRow1: [2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,5,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,2,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nRow6: [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow7: [5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0]\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,0]\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]\n\nBut in the training examples, the central row's 5s were not altered. For example, in Example0's input, row3 was [5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0], and output was the same. So in the test input, row3's 3 would be replaced with 5. But the other 5s in row3 are already 5. So row3 becomes [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0].\n\nHowever, looking back at the training examples, when the central row has non-5 elements, like in Example1's input, row3 is [5,5,5,5,0,0,4,0,0,0]. The output's row3 is [5,5,5,5,0,0,4,0,0,0]. So the 4 in row3 is not replaced. This suggests that even if a cluster is in row3, if it's not part of the central 5 cluster, it's replaced. But in Example1's input, row3 has a 4 in column6. But in the output, it remains 4. So this contradicts the previous hypothesis.\n\nThis indicates that the central row's non-5 elements are not replaced. So the replacement only happens to clusters not in row3. So in the test input, row3's 3 would remain 3? But according to the previous examples, the 3 cluster is not connected to the central 5s. So it should be replaced. But in Example1's input, row3 has a 4 in column6 which is not replaced. So this suggests that the central row's elements are not replaced, even if they're not part of the central 5 cluster.\n\nSo for the test input, row3's 3 is part of the 3 cluster, which is not connected to the central 5s. But since it's in row3, it's not replaced. This complicates things.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: clusters not connected to the central 5s and not in row3 are replaced with 5. Clusters in row3 are left as is.\n\nSo in the test input, the 3 cluster in rows3-5, columns5-6. The 3 in row3 is not replaced because it's in row3, but the 3s in rows4-5 are replaced. But this contradicts Example1, where in the input row3 has a 4 in column6, and it remains in the output.\n\nSo in Example1's input, row3: [5,5,5,5,0,0,4,0,0,0]. Output row3: same. So the 4 in row3 is not replaced. So the rule is that any cluster not in row3 and not connected to the central 5s are replaced. Clusters in row3 are kept.\n\nSo in the test input, the 3 in row3 is kept, but the 3s in rows4-5 are replaced. So row3's 3 remains 3, but rows4-5's 3s become 5.\n\nBut this complicates the replacement logic. The 3 cluster is split into row3's 3 and rows4-5's 3s. But since row3's 3 is not part of the central 5 cluster, but it's in row3, it remains. The other 3s are not in row3 and not connected to central 5s, so replaced.\n\nThis aligns with Example1's handling of the 4 in row3.\n\nSo applying this, the test input's 3 in row3, column5 remains 3. The 3s in rows4-5 become 5.\n\nSo the output for the test input would have:\n\nRow3: [5,5,5,5,0,3,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0]\n\nThe other changes are:\n\n- The 6 cluster in rows0-2, columns7-8 \u21925.\n\n- The 8 cluster in rows6-7, columns0-2 \u21925.\n\n- The 4 cluster in rows6-8, column8 \u21925.\n\n- The 7 cluster in rows8-9, columns4-6 \u21925.\n\nSo putting this together, the test output should be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut I need to verify this against the training examples' patterns.\n\nExample0's output left the 7s in row0-2 as they were, even though they were not connected to the central 5s. So why were they not replaced? Because they are in rows0-2, not below row3. The replacement seems to apply only to clusters in rows below the central row (row3).\n\nWait, in Example0, the replaced clusters are in rows5-7. Example1's replaced cluster is in rows7-8. Example2's replaced cluster is in rows0-1 (upper part). So the pattern is not restricted to upper or lower.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that clusters not connected to the central 5s (excluding those in row3) are replaced with 5. So the test input's clusters not connected to the central 5s would be replaced.",
