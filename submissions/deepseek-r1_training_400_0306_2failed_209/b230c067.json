        "cot_1": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has 8s arranged in certain shapes, and the output replaces them with 1s and 2s. Let me compare the input and output rows.\n\nLooking at the input's second row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8]. The output becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2]. So those 8s turned into 2s. Then in the third row of input: [0,8,8,8,8,0,0,8,0,8]. The output here is [0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,0,2]. So the first group of 8s (four in a line?) became 1s, and the next 8s became 2s. Hmm, maybe the 8s are being categorized into different groups, maybe based on their shape or position.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 0's input, the 8s form two distinct shapes. The upper part looks like a square or rectangle, and the lower part another shape. The output replaces them with 1s and 2s. Maybe the transformation is identifying different connected regions of 8s and assigning numbers in the order they are encountered, but why 1 and 2 here?\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input, there's a group of 8s that becomes 1s and another group that becomes 2s. For instance, the first group in row 1 and 2 (like a 'U' shape maybe) becomes 1s, and the group starting at row 5 (the two 8s) becomes 2s. So perhaps the regions are numbered based on their order of appearance from top to bottom, left to right. So the first encountered region (when scanning the grid row by row) becomes 1, the next becomes 2, etc. But in the output, sometimes it's 1 and 2. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first 8s appear in the second row, starting at position 7 (index 7). Then, the third row has 8s starting at position 1. Wait, but in the output, those are 1s. So maybe the first connected region is 1, the next is 2. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0 input:\n\nRow 1 (second row) has 8s at positions 7,8,9. Then row 2 (third row) has 8s starting at position 1. So these are two separate regions. Then in the output, row 1's 8s become 2, and the ones starting at row 2 become 1. That contradicts the idea of order. Hmm, maybe the numbering is based on the order in which the regions are first encountered. Wait, row 1 comes before row 2. If the first 8s are in row 1 (second row), but in the output, they are 2. But row 2's 8s are 1 in the output. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the regions are being labeled based on their size. For example, larger regions are labeled 1 and smaller 2? Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input: The upper 8s (in rows 1-4) form a larger structure, perhaps a square with a hole. Let's count the number of 8s. The first region (the one labeled 1 in output) seems to have more cells. Let me count:\n\nLooking at Example 0's output rows:\n\nIn the output, the 1s form a square-like shape. For example, rows 2,3,4 have 1s. Let's count the 1s:\n\nRow 2 (output) has 1s at positions 1-4 (four 1s).\nRow 3 has 1 at position 1 and 4.\nRow 4 has 1s at positions 1-4 again. So total 4 + 2 +4 = 10 1s? Maybe. The 2s are in row 1, parts of row2-3. Let's count 2s: row1 has three 2s, row2 has two 2s, row3 has three 2s, row7-10 have 1s again? Wait no. In Example 0's output, the lower part (rows 7-10) have 1s again. So maybe each connected component is assigned a unique number, but why are some 1 and others 2?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers 1 and 2 represent different shapes. For example, solid squares (or rectangles) vs. other shapes. Or maybe the transformation is replacing the 8s with 1 if they form a square with a hole (like a ring), and 2 otherwise.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nThe 1s in the output correspond to a ring shape. For example, row2 input has 8,8,8,8. But the output for row2 is 1s. Wait, but row3 input has 8,0,0,8, so maybe it's a ring structure. So perhaps regions that form hollow squares are labeled 1, and filled squares are 2? Or maybe the other way around.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are for the regions that have exactly four neighbors (i.e., cross-shaped) but that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number indicates the number of adjacent 8s in the original input. Wait, but that would vary per cell. The output in the examples has entire regions replaced by 1 or 2, so it's per region, not per cell.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is to replace all 8s with a number indicating how many separate regions they are part of, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, let's look at the third example, Example 2. In the input, the first 8s are in row1 (positions 1-3) forming a horizontal line, which in the output becomes 1s. Then in row5, the input has [8,8,0,0...], which in the output becomes 2s. Then in row6, there's [8,8,0,8,8,8,0...], which becomes 2s and 1s. Wait, the output for row6 is [2,2,0,1,1,1,0...]. Hmm, so maybe the regions are being colored alternately as 1 and 2 based on their position or order of discovery.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers alternate based on the order in which regions are encountered. The first region found is 1, the next 2, the next 1 again, etc. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nThe first 8s are in row1 (second row), positions 7-9. Then the next 8s are in row2, positions 1-4. So if the first region is labeled 2 and the next 1, that contradicts. But in the output, the first 8s in row1 are labeled 2, and the ones starting in row2 are 1. So maybe the labeling starts at 2 and then 1? That seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the labeling depends on the vertical position: regions higher up are 2, lower ones 1? But in Example 2, the first region (row1) becomes 1, and the next (row5) becomes 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the 1s and 2s correspond to different types of shapes. For example, closed loops (like a ring) become 1s, while solid blocks become 2s. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the upper region (labeled 1 in the output) seems to form a ring. Let's see:\n\nRow2: 8s at 1-4.\nRow3: 8 at 1, 4, and others?\nWait, row2 input is [0,8,8,8,8,0,0,8,0,8]. So positions 1-4 are 8s, then 8 at 7,9. Then row3: [0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,8,8]. So positions 1,4,7-9. Hmm, not sure if that's a ring. Maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, maybe the 1s are regions that have at least one cell with four 8 neighbors (like a cross), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are based on the size of the regions. For example, larger regions are 1, smaller ones 2. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's input:\n\nThe upper regions (labeled 1 in output) have more cells than the lower regions (labeled 2). Wait, no. The upper region labeled 1 in output has cells in rows 2,3,4. Let's count:\n\nRow2: positions 1-4, 7,9: 6 cells.\nRow3: positions 1,4,7,8,9: 5 cells.\nRow4: positions 1-4: 4 cells. So total 6+5+4=15 cells. The lower region in row7-10 (output 1) has cells. Let's see: rows7,8,9. Row7: positions5-8: four 8s. Row8: positions5-8: 8 at 5, 8 at 7,8,9 (maybe). Wait, the input for row7 in Example0 is [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0]. So positions5-8 are 8s. Row8: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0]. So positions5 and 8 are 8. Row9: positions5-8 are 8s again. So row7: four 8s. Row8: two 8s. Row9: four 8s. So total 4+2+4=10. So the upper region (15 cells) is labeled 1, and the lower (10) is also labeled 1. But in the output, the lower region is labeled 1 again, but in the first example, there are two regions labeled 1 and 2. Wait, no. Looking back at Example0's output:\n\nThe output has regions labeled 1 and 2. The upper part (rows1-4) has 2s in row1 and parts of rows2-3. The 1s are in rows2-4. Then the lower part (rows7-10) has 1s again. So there are multiple regions labeled 1. That suggests that the labeling is not based on size, but perhaps the order of regions. Maybe the first region encountered is labeled 1, the next 2, the next 1 again, etc.\n\nBut in Example0's input, the first 8s are in row1 (positions7-9). Then row2 has 8s starting at position1. So if the order is row-wise, left to right, then the first 8 is row1, position7. Then the next is row2, position1. So the first region (row1's 8s) is labeled 2, and the next (row2's) labeled 1. That doesn't fit a simple alternating order. So maybe the labeling isn't based on order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s represent regions that are connected in a certain way, like 4-directionally, and 2s are connected 8-directionally. Wait, but that's a stretch. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the input and output of Example0 and Example1, perhaps the output is replacing 8s with 1 if the region is a 4-connected cross shape, and 2 otherwise. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers represent the number of \"holes\" in the region. For example, a solid square has 0 holes (labeled 2), and a square ring has 1 hole (labeled 1). Let's check.\n\nIn Example0's upper region (labeled 1 in output), the input's rows 2-4 form a structure. Let me visualize:\n\nRow2 (input): 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 8 0 8\nRow3: 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 8 8\nRow4: 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the upper region (rows2-4) has a shape that might be a cross or something else. Maybe it's a ring. For example, in row3, there's 8 at position1 and 4, but 0 in between. So maybe it's a ring. If that's the case, then the region has a hole, so labeled 1. The other regions (like the lower one in rows7-10) may also form a ring. Wait, looking at rows7-9:\n\nRow7 input: 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0\nRow8: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 8 0\nRow9: 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0\n\nSo this forms a ring: the center cell (position7 in row8) is 0. So the region is a ring, hence has a hole. So labeled 1. Then the upper region in Example0's input (labeled 1) has a hole. The regions labeled 2 in Example0 are the ones in row1 (positions7-9) which is a horizontal line of 3 8s. That's a solid line with no hole. So perhaps regions with holes are labeled 1, and solid (no holes) are labeled 2.\n\nLet's check Example1's input and output.\n\nIn Example1's output, the first region is labeled 2 (positions7-10 in row1). Let's see if that region has a hole. The input row1 has 8s in positions7-10. Let's check the surrounding rows. Row2: [0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,8,8]. So maybe the region is connected downwards. But in row2, positions7-8 are 0, so the row1's 8s are a separate region. If that's the case, then it's a solid line (no hole), so labeled 2. Then the next region (row2-4's 8s) would have a hole. Let's see:\n\nRow2 input: 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8\nRow3: 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8\nRow4: 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n\nHmm, this region might be a solid block. For example, row2's 8s start at position1 (but no, row2's positions are 1-4, then 8-9). Wait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nRow2 input: [0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,8,8]. So positions1-4 (8s) and 8-9 (8s). Wait, that would make two separate regions? But in the output, these are labeled as 1 and 2. So maybe in the input, the region is split. Alternatively, maybe the entire structure is connected. Wait, in row2, positions1-4 are 8s, then in row3, positions3-4 are 8s, but row3's positions1-2 are 0. So maybe it's a solid shape without a hole, hence labeled 2. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the regions are classified based on their minimal bounding rectangle. If the region fills the entire rectangle, it's labeled 2; if it has empty spaces (holes), labeled 1. So for example, a rectangle filled with 8s is 2, and a ring (with empty inside) is 1.\n\nIn Example0's upper region labeled 1: If that's a ring, then the minimal bounding rectangle is 4x3 (assuming rows2-4 and columns1-4). But the actual 8s form a ring, so the rectangle isn't filled, hence labeled 1. The lower region labeled 1 also forms a ring (with a hole in row8), so it's 1. The region in row1 (positions7-9) is a solid line, so minimal rectangle is 3x1, filled, hence labeled 2. That fits.\n\nIn Example1's output:\n\nRow1's 8s are a solid line (positions7-10), labeled 2. Then row2's positions1-4 form a solid line (4x1?), which in output is labeled 1. Wait, but that contradicts. Hmm. Maybe the rule is different. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the output numbers. In Example0, the regions labeled 1 are those that form a shape where a cell has exactly two diagonal neighbors. Or maybe regions that are connected diagonally. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers might represent the layer of the region. The outermost regions are 2, and inner ones are 1. But I'm not sure how that applies.\n\nAlternatively, think of the numbers as toggling between 1 and 2 each time a new region is found. For instance, the first region found (when scanning top to bottom, left to right) is labeled 1, the next 2, then 1 again, etc. Let's check this.\n\nIn Example0's input:\n\nThe first 8s are in row1 (second row), positions7-9. Then the next 8 is in row2, position1. So first region (positions7-9 in row1) is labeled 2. Second region (positions1-4 in row2) is labeled 1. Then the next region (positions7,9 in row2) is part of the first region (row1's region), so same label. Then the lower regions in rows7-9: when scanning, the first region in row7 would be found after the earlier ones, so labeled 1 again (since after 2 comes 1). But in the output, those are labeled 1. Hmm, maybe the order is to scan left to right, top to bottom, and each time a new region is found, the label alternates between 1 and 2. But in that case, the first region (row1, positions7-9) would be labeled 1, next (row2, positions1-4) labeled 2, and so on. But in the output, the first region is labeled 2. So maybe the initial label is 2, then alternates. Like, first region 2, next 1, next 2, etc. Let's check:\n\nIn Example0:\n\n- First region: row1, positions7-9 (3 cells) \u2192 label 2.\n\n- Next region: row2, positions1-4 \u2192 label 1.\n\n- Then the regions in row2, positions7,9 \u2192 part of the first region (if connected), but maybe not. If they are connected, then same label. But in the output, those cells are labeled 2, which suggests they are part of the first region (label 2). So maybe those are connected via row1's region. How?\n\nWait, in row1 (input) the cells are positions7-9. Then in row2, positions7 and 9 are 8s. So if they are connected diagonally, then they are part of the same region. But in standard flood fill, regions are connected via 4-directional (up, down, left, right), not diagonal. So if it's 4-connected, then row1's region (positions7-9) is not connected to row2's positions7 and 9, since there's no vertical or horizontal connection. Therefore, row2's positions7 and 9 are separate regions. But in the output, they are labeled 2, same as row1's region. So perhaps the labeling considers diagonal connections. That's possible. Let's check.\n\nIf the regions are 8-connected (including diagonals), then row1's 8 at position7 (row1, col7) is adjacent to row2's col7 cell (which is 8). So connected diagonally? If so, then they are part of the same region. So the entire structure would be one region. But in the output, those 8s in row2's positions7 and 9 are labeled 2, same as row1's. So maybe that's the case.\n\nBut then, in Example0's input, the region in row2, positions1-4 is a separate region (labeled 1). So first region (row1) is 2, then next (row2) is 1. So alternating labels. Then, in row7, the 8s are in positions5-8. This is a new region. Since previous label was 1, next would be 2. But in the output, they are labeled 1. So that breaks the alternation.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the labels are assigned based on the parity of the region's size. For example, even-sized regions are 2, odd-sized are 1. But in Example0's first region (3 cells), which is labeled 2. That's even. No, 3 is odd. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the labels 1 and 2 alternate based on the region's position, like left side vs right side. For example, regions on the left are 1, right are 2. But in Example0's upper region is on the left (columns1-4) and labeled 1, while the right regions are 2. That fits. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example1's input, the upper regions are on the right (positions7-10) labeled 2, and the left ones (positions1-4) labeled 1. That also fits. In Example2's input, the first region is on the left (positions1-3) labeled 1, then the next region is on the left (row5) labeled 2. Wait, but row5's region is on the left, but labeled 2. So that contradicts. So maybe not.\n\nAnother idea: look for the number of 8s in each region. If a region has even number of 8s, label it 2; if odd, label 1. Let's check Example0's first region (row1's 3 cells) \u2192 3 (odd), labeled 2. No. Example0's next region (row2-4) has many cells, maybe even count \u2192 labeled 1. Doesn't fit. So not likely.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let's see the test input and see if applying a certain pattern would fit.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,8,0]\n[0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0]\n[0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n[0,8,8,8,0,0,8,8,8,8]\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0]\n\nLooking for regions of 8s:\n\nRow1 (second row): 8s at positions1-2 and 6-8 (indices 1,2 and 6,7,8). But wait, row1 is [0,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,8,0]. So positions 1,2 (8s), then positions6-8 (8s). So two separate regions here? Or connected via diagonal?\n\nIf regions are 8-connected:\n\nRow1's 8s at positions1-2 and 6-8. Are they connected? There's a gap between 2 and 6. No, so two separate regions. Then row2 has 8 at position2 and 8. Let's see:\n\nRow2: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0]. So 8s at positions2 and 8. Are these connected to any previous regions? Position2 in row2 is adjacent to row1's position2 (8). So that's connected (since vertically adjacent). So row1's positions1-2 and row2's position2 are part of the same region.\n\nRow3 has 8 at position1 and 7. Position1 is adjacent to row2's position1 (0) and row3's position1 is 8. So not connected to previous regions. Position7: row3's position7 is 8, but row2's position7 is 0. So new region.\n\nRow4 has 8s at position1 and 7. Position1 is adjacent to row3's position1 (8), so connected. Position7: adjacent to row3's position7 (0), so new region.\n\nRow4's position1 is connected to row3's position1 (8) \u2192 same region. So this region starts at row3's position1.\n\nRow5: 8s at positions1-3,7-10. So positions1-3 (connected to row4's position1 (8) \u2192 same region. Positions7-10: adjacent to row4's position7 (8) \u2192 same region as row3's position7 and row4's position7. So in row5, these two parts are connected via row4's position7?\n\nWait, row4's position7 is 8. Row5's position7 is 8. So vertically connected. So row3's position7 (8) \u2192 row4's position7 (8) \u2192 row5's position7 (8). So that's a vertical line. So those form a connected region.\n\nSo the regions in the test input are:\n\n1. The left region: starts at row1's positions1-2, connected to row2's position2, row3's position2 (no, row2's position2 is 8, row3's position2 is 0). Wait, row1's positions1-2 (8,8), row2's position2 (8), row3's position2 (0). So row1's 8s are connected to row2's position2 (8), but row3's position2 is 0. So the left region is row1's positions1-2, row2's position2, and row4's position1, row5's positions1-3.\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\nRow1: positions1-2 are 8.\n\nRow2: position2 is 8 (connected to row1's position2 via vertical).\n\nRow3: position2 is 0. So the left region is row1's 1-2, row2's 2.\n\nRow3: position3 is 8 (row3's position3 is 8?), no. Row3's input is [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]. Wait, position2 is 8. So row3's position2 is 8. Wait, no. Wait the second row in the test input is index1 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? The input lists are 0-based probably.)\n\nWait, the test input's rows are:\n\nRow0: [0s...]\n\nRow1: [0,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,8,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0]\n\nRow3: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]\n\nRow4: [0,8,8,8,0,0,8,8,8,8]\n\nSo row1's positions are 1 and 2 (8s), row2's position2 is 8.\n\nSo row1's (1,2) and row2's (2) are connected (vertically), forming a region. Then row3's position1 is 8. Is that connected to row2's position2? Diagonally. So if the regions are 8-connected (including diagonally), then row3's position1 is connected to row2's position2. So yes. Then this region extends to row3's position1, row4's position1, and row5's positions1-3.\n\nSo this left region is connected via diagonal and vertical, forming a larger shape.\n\nThen the right regions: row1's positions6-8 (8s), row2's position8 (8), row3's position7 (8), row4's position7 (8), row5's positions7-10 (8s), row6's positions3-5 (8s?), wait row6's input is [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0], so positions3-5 (if 0-based, indexes 3,4,5) are 8s. Then row7 has position5 (8), row8 has position4 (8), row9 has positions3-6 (8s).\n\nSo these form another connected region if considering diagonal connections.\n\nAssuming the regions are 8-connected, then the left and right regions are separate.\n\nNow, applying the pattern from training examples, which regions are labeled 1 and which 2?\n\nIn the training examples, regions that are rings (with holes) are labeled 1, solid regions are labeled 2. Let's see if the test input's regions are rings or solid.\n\nLeft region (connected via diagonal and vertical):\n\n- row1: 8,8.\n\n- row2: 8 at position2.\n\n- row3: 8 at position1.\n\n- row4: 8 at position1.\n\n- row5: 8,8,8 in positions1-3.\n\nThis seems to form a sort of diagonal line with some thickness, but it's hard to see if it's a ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a solid region. For example, it's a path that meanders down, possibly forming a loop. But I don't see a hole. So if it's solid, labeled 2.\n\nThe right region:\n\nStarting from row1's positions6-8, connected to row2's position8, row3's position7, row4's position7, row5's positions7-10. Then row6's positions3-5 (8s), row7's position5 (8), row8's position4 (8), row9's positions3-6 (8s).\n\nThis right region may form a more complex shape. Let's see:\n\nrow1: positions6-8 (three 8s).\n\nrow2: position8 (8).\n\nrow3: position7 (8).\n\nrow4: position7 (8).\n\nrow5: positions7-10 (four 8s).\n\nrow6: positions3-5 (three 8s).\n\nrow7: position5 (8).\n\nrow8: position4 (8).\n\nrow9: positions3-6 (four 8s).\n\nThis seems to form a sort of spiral or interconnected lines. It's unclear if there's a hole. For example, the 8s in row6 (positions3-5) are connected to row5's positions7-10 via row5's position7 (8) and row6's position3 (8). But how? If regions are 8-connected, then row5's position7 (8) is adjacent to row6's position3 (8) diagonally. So yes.\n\nThis entire structure might form a solid region with no holes, hence labeled 2. Or perhaps there's a hole. But without seeing the exact shape, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test input's right region forms a ring. For example, the 8s in row9 form a horizontal line, and perhaps there's a hole in the center. Looking at row9's input: [0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0]. So positions3-6 are 8s. Row8: [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. So position4 is 8. Row7: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]. Position5 is 8. So perhaps these form a diagonal line. Not sure.\n\nIf the regions are labeled based on having holes or not, and in the test input, the left region is solid (no hole) \u2192 labeled 2, and the right region is solid \u2192 labeled 2, but then there might be other regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another region. For example, row6's positions3-5 (8s), connected to row7's position5, row8's position4, row9's positions3-6. This might form a separate region. If it's connected to the earlier right region, then it's part of the same. But if not, perhaps another region.\n\nBut according to the training examples, the output uses 1 and 2. So in the test input, perhaps there are two main regions: one labeled 1 and another 2.\n\nBut without a clear pattern from the training examples, this is challenging.\n\nLet me look back at Example2's input and output. In Example2's input, there are two regions: one in the upper part (labeled 1) and one in the lower part (labeled 2). The upper region's shape is a square with a hole (like the letter 'U'), and the lower region is a solid block. So solid blocks are labeled 2, hollow ones 1. But in Example0's output, the lower region is also hollow (ring) and labeled 1. So maybe hollow regions are 1, solid are 2.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nLeft region: possibly a diagonal line, which is a solid region (no holes) \u2192 labeled 2.\n\nRight region: perhaps has a hole. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the right region in the test input, perhaps there's a hole. For example, in row5: positions7-10 are 8s. row6: positions3-5 are 8s. row7: position5 is 8. row8: position4 is 8. row9: positions3-6 are 8s. This might form a sort of loop. For instance, the 8s form a path that loops around a central 0. Let's see:\n\nIn row9: positions3-6 are 8s. Row8: position4 is 8. Row7: position5 is 8. Row6: positions3-5 are 8s. So this forms a sort of diamond shape. If there's a 0 in the center, then it's a ring. For example, row7's position4 is 0 (row7's input: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0]), so position5 is 8, but position4 is 0. So the 8s form a path around the center (position4 in row7). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the right region in the test input has no holes, thus labeled 2, and the left region has a hole and is labeled 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's try to see if the left region in the test input has a hole. The left region's path is:\n\nRow1: positions1-2.\n\nRow2: position2.\n\nRow3: position1.\n\nRow4: position1.\n\nRow5: positions1-3.\n\nThis seems to form a sort of diagonal line. No hole there. So labeled 2.\n\nThe right region: maybe in row5's positions7-10, which are 8s. Then row6's positions3-5 are 8s. These may form a connected region. If there's a 0 in the middle, like row6's position4 is 8 (since row6 is [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]), positions3-5 are all 8s. So solid line. No hole. So labeled 2.\n\nBut then, where is the region labeled 1? Maybe there's another region. For example, the 8s in row3's position7 (8), row4's position7 (8), row5's positions7-10. This could form a vertical line. No hole. So labeled 2.\n\nWait, but according to the training examples, there are regions labeled 1 and 2. In the test input, if all regions are solid, they should be labeled 2. But the training examples have both 1 and 2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing the pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: look at the outputs. Each output is a transformation of the input where 8s are replaced with 1s or 2s. The key is to find what determines 1 vs 2.\n\nAnother observation: in Example0's output, the regions labeled 1 are those that are connected but not connected to the top or bottom edges. Or maybe it's based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 1s are regions that are surrounded by 0s on all four sides (unlikely, since that's rare).\n\nAlternatively, the number indicates the number of 8s in the region modulo 2. So even count \u2192 2, odd \u2192 1. But in Example0's first region (3 cells, odd) labeled 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are assigned based on the order in which the regions are encountered. The first region is 1, the second 2, etc. But in Example0, the first region (row1's 8s) is labeled 2, the next (row2's 8s) labeled 1, which would imply alternating.\n\nWait, perhaps the regions are alternately labeled starting with 2. For example, first region 2, next 1, next 2, etc. Let's check:\n\nExample0:\n\nRegion1 (row1's 8s): labeled 2.\n\nRegion2 (row2's 8s): labeled 1.\n\nRegion3 (lower part's 8s): labeled 1. But this is third region, which would be 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample1:\n\nRegion1 (row1's 8s): labeled 2.\n\nRegion2 (row2's 8s): labeled 1.\n\nRegion3 (rows6-8's 8s): labeled 1. Again, third region labeled 1. So the pattern isn't clear.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output uses 1 for regions that are connected to the left edge and 2 for those connected to the right edge. But in Example0's first region (row1's 8s) are on the right edge, labeled 2. The next region (row2's left 8s) are connected to the left edge (row2's position1 is 8), so labeled 1. That fits. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample1's first region (row1's 8s) are on the right edge (positions7-10) \u2192 labeled 2. Next region (row2's positions1-4) connected to left edge \u2192 labeled 1. Then row6's 8s (positions3-6) are connected to left edge? No, they start at position3. But in the output, they are labeled 1. Hmm, not sure.\n\nExample2's first region (row1's 8s) are connected to left edge (positions1-3) \u2192 labeled 1. The next region (row5's 8s) starts at position0 (if 0-based) \u2192 connected to left edge, but labeled 2. So that contradicts.\n\nThis approach might not work.\n\nBack to the original examples. Let's compare the input and output cells.\n\nIn Example0's input, the 8s in the upper left (row2-4) form a shape that in the output becomes 1s. The shape looks like a ring. The region in row1 (right side) is a horizontal line, which becomes 2s. So maybe rings are 1, lines are 2.\n\nExample1's input has a horizontal line (row1's 8s) \u2192 2s, and other shapes. For instance, row2-4's 8s form a sort of L-shape \u2192 labeled 1. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the shape's width and height. For example, regions that are at least two cells wide and tall are 1, others are 2.\n\nIn Example0's upper left region is 4 cells wide and 3 tall \u2192 labeled 1. The row1's region is 3 cells wide and 1 tall \u2192 labeled 2. That fits.\n\nExample1's row1's region is 4 cells wide and 1 tall \u2192 labeled 2. The row2-4's region is 4 cells wide (in row2) but not sure about height. If it's 3 rows tall, then labeled 1. This could fit.\n\nExample2's row1-2's region is 3 cells wide and 2 tall \u2192 labeled 1. Row5-7's region is 2 cells wide and 2 tall \u2192 labeled 2. So this fits.\n\nSo the pattern could be: regions with both width and height >= 2 are labeled 1, others (lines or single-cell) labeled 2.\n\nTesting this with the examples:\n\nExample0:\n\n- Upper left region: width 4, height 3 \u2192 1.\n\n- Row1's region: width 3, height 1 \u2192 2.\n\n- Lower region: width 4, height 3 \u2192 1.\n\nBut the lower region in Example0's output is labeled 1, which fits.\n\nExample1:\n\n- Row1's region: width 4, height 1 \u2192 2.\n\n- Row2-4's region: let's see. Row2's positions1-4: width 4, but how many rows? It spans rows2-4 (3 rows), so height 3. So labeled 1.\n\n- Row6-8's region: in Example1's input, the lower regions are in rows6-8. For example, row6's 8s are positions3-6 (width 4, height 1?), but they might be connected to row7 and row8's 8s. So height 3, width 4 \u2192 labeled 1.\n\nBut in the output, these are labeled 1. So this fits.\n\nExample2:\n\n- Upper region in rows1-2: width 3, height 2 \u2192 labeled 1.\n\n- Lower region in rows5-7: width 2 (row5's 8s are two), but how? The lower region in row5 is two 8s (positions0-1), then row6's 8s at positions0-1 and 3-5. So this region's width and height could be larger. But in the output, this region is labeled 2. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm, perhaps not.\n\nAnother angle: in the outputs, the 1s form closed loops or rectangles, while 2s are lines or other shapes. For example, in Example0's output, the 1s form a rectangle with a hole (like a ring), while the 2s are lines. In Example1's output, the 1s form a larger connected region, possibly a rectangle, and the 2s are lines.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of the test input again. The left region is a diagonal line, which would be a line (labeled 2), and the right region might form a more complex shape. If the right region is a solid rectangle, it's labeled 2. If it's a ring, labeled 1.\n\nBut I can't be sure. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the pattern is that each region is alternately labeled starting from 1, but considering 8-connected regions. So the first region encountered (scanning top to bottom, left to right) is 1, next 2, etc.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nThe first 8 is in row1, position1. This starts a region. The next 8 is row1, position2. Then in row2, position2. Then row3, position1. Then row4, position1. Then row5, positions1-3. This entire region is the first encountered, labeled 1.\n\nThe next region is in row1, positions6-8. Then row2's position8. Then row3's position7. Then row4's position7. Then row5's positions7-10. Then row6's positions3-5. Then row7's position5. Then row8's position4. Then row9's positions3-6. This is the second region, labeled 2.\n\nSo the output would have the left region as 1 and the right as 2.\n\nLooking at the training examples, this fits Example0 and Example1. For example, in Example0, the first region (row1's 8s) is labeled 2, which would be the second region if the first is the one starting in row2. But this contradicts. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is based on the leftmost then topmost cell. The earliest region in row1, position1 is first, labeled 1. Then the next region in row1, position6 is second, labeled 2.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nLeft region (starting at row1, position1) \u2192 1.\n\nRight region (starting at row1, position6) \u2192 2.\n\nOther regions are part of these two.\n\nThus, in the test input's output, the left 8s are 1, and the right 8s are 2.\n\nLooking at the training examples, this would fit. For example, in Example0's input, the first region is row1, position7 \u2192 earliest is row1, position7. The next region is row2, position1. So row2, position1 is earlier than row1, position7 in the scanning order (row-wise, left to right). Wait, no. Because row1 is scanned before row2. So in Example0's input, the first 8 is at row1, position7. Then row2's position1 comes later in the scan. So the first region would be row1's 8s, labeled 1. But in the output, it's labeled 2. So this contradicts.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given time constraints, perhaps the pattern is that each connected region of 8s is alternately labeled 1 and 2 based on the order they are encountered, with the first region being 1, the second 2, third 1, etc. But in Example0's output, the first region is labeled 2. So perhaps it's the opposite: first region 2, then 1, etc.\n\nAlternatively, the labeling starts at 2 and alternates. So first region 2, second 1, third 2, etc.\n\nIn Example0's input, the first region encountered (row1's 8s) is labeled 2. The second region (row2's 8s) is labeled 1. The third region (lower part) is labeled 1 again, which contradicts. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the regions are labeled 1 if they are on the left half of the grid and 2 if on the right. But Example0's upper left region is labeled 1, which is on the left. The lower region is on the right but labeled 1, which contradicts.\n\nAnother Idea: The transformation counts the number of 8s in each connected region and labels them with 1 if the count is even and 2 if odd. But in Example0's first region (row1's 8s) has 3 cells (odd) \u2192 labeled 2. Second region has 15 cells (odd) \u2192 labeled 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, 1 for even count, 2 for odd. But in Example0's second region (15 cells, odd) \u2192 labeled 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nPerhaps the labels are based on the parity of the region's starting column. For example, regions starting in an even column (0-based) are 2, odd are 1. In Example0's first region starts at column7 (0-based), which is odd \u2192 labeled 2. Second region starts at column1 (odd) \u2192 labeled 1. Fits. Third region starts at column5 (even) \u2192 labeled 2, but in the output it's labeled 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to proceed with the test input. Assume that each connected region is alternately labeled starting with 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers 1 and 2 represent the type of connection. For example, regions connected via 4-directional are 1, and those connected via 8-directional are 2. But I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 8s with 1s if the cell has an even number of adjacent 8s, and 2s if odd. But this would vary per cell, but in the examples, entire regions are labeled with the same number. So this is unlikely.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output's 1s and 2s correspond to the input's 8s being part of a letter-like shape. For example, 'O' shapes are 1, 'I' shapes are 2. But this is too vague.\n\nIn the test input, the left region might form a 'Z' shape, and the right region a spiral. But this doesn't help.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess that the pattern is labeling regions alternately as 1 and 2 based on the order they are encountered during a row-wise scan. The first region is 1, next 2, etc. But in Example0's first region is labeled 2, so maybe it's the reverse.\n\nAlternatively, the first region encountered is labeled 2, next 1, and so on. Let's check:\n\nExample0's first region (row1's 8s) \u2192 labeled 2.\n\nSecond region (row2's 8s) \u2192 labeled 1.\n\nThird region (lower part) \u2192 labeled 1 again? No. Maybe the lower region is part of the second region.\n\nIn the test input, the first region is the left 8s, labeled 2. The next is the right 8s, labeled 1. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the regions are labeled based on their horizontal position: left regions are 1, right regions are 2.\n\nIn the test input:\n\nLeft region \u2192 1.\n\nRight region \u2192 2.\n\nWhich matches Example0 and Example1. Example0's left region is 1, right region 2. Example1's left region is 1, right region 2. Example2's left regions are 1 and 2 (possibly based on order).\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nLeft region (left side) \u2192 1.\n\nRight region (right side) \u2192 2.\n\nThus, the output would have the left 8s replaced with 1, right with 2.\n\nBut looking at the test input's rows:\n\nRow1: 8s on left (positions1-2) and right (6-8).\n\nRow2: left (position2), right (position8).\n\nRow3: left (position1), right (position7).\n\nRow4: left (position1), right (position7-10).\n\nRow5: left (positions1-3), right (7-10).\n\nRow6: right (positions3-5).\n\nRow7: right (position5).\n\nRow8: right (position4).\n\nRow9: right (positions3-6).\n\nSo the left region is on the left side of the grid, and the right region is on the right.\n\nThus, replacing left 8s with 1 and right with 2.\n\nBut in Example2, the first region is on the left (labeled 1), the next is also on the left (row5, positions0-1), labeled 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe in that case, the first region is left \u2192 1, next region also left but labeled 2 because it's a separate region. So the left-right rule isn't absolute, but based on the region's position.\n\nAlternatively, split the grid into vertical halves. Left half (columns 0-4) labeled 1, right half (5-9) labeled 2. Let's check Example0:\n\nLeft half (columns0-4) have regions labeled 1, right half 2. This fits Example0.\n\nExample1: left regions labeled 1, right labeled 2. Fits.\n\nExample2: left regions labeled 1 and 2. Doesn't fit. So this can't be.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the regions are labeled 1 if they are on the left side of the grid when first encountered, and 2 if on the right. But again, Example2's second region is on the left but labeled 2.\n\nI think I've exhausted most possibilities. Given the training examples and the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the assumption that the pattern is to label each connected region of 8s alternately starting with 2 for the first region, then 1, then 2, etc. \n\nIn the test input, the first region encountered (row1, position1) is labeled 2. The next region (row1, position6) is labeled 1. Other regions are part of these two if connected.\n\nBut considering the test input's right region is connected (8-connected), it would be a single region. So the left region is labeled 2, the right region labeled 1. But according to the training examples, the left regions are labeled 1. So this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the labeling is based on whether the region is connected to the top or bottom. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll make a best guess based on the training examples. In the training examples, regions that form rings (hollow) are labeled 1, solid regions labeled 2. Applying this to the test input:\n\nLeft region is a solid diagonal line \u2192 labeled 2.\n\nRight region may form a ring (hole in the middle) \u2192 labeled 1.\n\nThus, the output would have the right region as 1 and left as 2. But I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, the test input's right region is solid \u2192 labeled 2. Left region is solid \u2192 labeled 2. But then where are the 1s?\n\nAnother possibility: the test input's left region is a ring. Let's check. The left region's path is:\n\nRow1: 8,8.\n\nRow2: 8.\n\nRow3: 8.\n\nRow4: 8.\n\nRow5: 8,8,8.\n\nIf this forms a loop, then there's a hole. For example, maybe the cells in row3, position2 and row4, position2 are 0, forming a hole. But looking at the input:\n\nRow3's input: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]. So position2 is 0. Row4's input: [0,8,8,8,0,0,8,8,8,8]. So row4's position2 is 8. So maybe the left region has no hole. Thus, labeled 2.\n\nThe right region's row6: [0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]. positions3-5 are 8s. Row7: position5 is 8. Row8: position4 is 8. Row9: positions3-6 are 8s. So this forms a sort of diamond shape. If there's a 0 in the center, like position4 in row7, then it's a ring. So labeled 1.\n\nThus, the right region is labeled 1, left labeled 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the test input's output would have the left regions as 2 and right as 1.\n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples?\n\nExample0's upper left region is a ring \u2192 labeled 1. The right region is a line \u2192 labeled 2. Lower region is a ring \u2192 labeled 1.\n\nExample1's left regions are solid \u2192 labeled 1. Right regions are solid \u2192 labeled 2.\n\nHmm, this is conflicting. I think I'm stuck, but I have to provide an answer.\n\nBased on the training examples, it seems that regions which are more complex (like rings) are labeled 1, and simpler (lines) labeled 2. Thus, in the test input, the right region's complex shape may be labeled 1, left's line labeled 2.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a 10x10 grid with 0s and 8s, and the output has 0s, 1s, and 2s. The goal is to map the 8s in the input to 1s and 2s in the output based on some rule.\n\nFirst, let's look at Example 0. In the input, there are regions of 8s. The output replaces some of these 8s with 1s and others with 2s. Hmm. Maybe it's based on the position of the 8s. Let me check the shapes. For instance, the first group in the input's second row ends up as 2s. The output's first 1s form a square or a rectangle. Wait, maybe it's about the direction or orientation of the 8s.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is distinguishing between horizontal and vertical groups of 8s. Like, horizontal lines become 2s and vertical or other shapes become 1s. Let me check. In Example 0, the first big block in row 2 is four 8s horizontally. Wait, no, looking at row 2 of the input (0,8,8,8,8,0...), the output for those is 1s. But in the same example, the rightmost part (row 1, columns 7-9) are 8s which become 2s. That group is three 8s in a horizontal line. Hmm, so maybe horizontal lines of 3 or more become 2s, and other shapes (like squares or vertical) become 1s.\n\nWait, in Example 0's row 1, the 8s are three in a row, so 2s. The next group in row 2 is four 8s in a row (horizontal?), but they become 1s. Wait, no, maybe I need to check the entire structure. Maybe the numbers 1 and 2 represent different types of connected regions. Like, perhaps the 1s are regions that form a square or a certain shape, and 2s are straight lines. Or maybe based on the direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about whether the 8s are part of a horizontal or vertical line. Let's see in Example 0:\n\nIn the output, the 2s are in horizontal lines. For example, the top right part in the input is three 8s in a row, which become 2s. Then the other 8s that form a square-like structure (maybe a 2x2 or larger) become 1s. So maybe horizontal lines of 8s become 2s, and other contiguous blocks become 1s.\n\nLet's check Example 1. The input has a horizontal line of four 8s in row 2 (columns 6-9), which in the output becomes 2s. Then in row 3, there's a vertical line of two 8s (columns 3-4?), but in the input they are part of a horizontal group. Wait, maybe the output's 1s are for any connected regions except horizontal lines. Or perhaps 1s are for vertical lines, but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait in Example 2's input, the first group in row 1 is three 8s horizontal, which become 1s. Wait, that contradicts the previous idea. So maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me look again.\n\nExample 2's input has [8,8,0,0...] in row 5 (input) which becomes 2,2 in the output. Then in row 6, the 8s form a horizontal line of three (columns 3-5?), which becomes 1s. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAnother approach: look for the numbers 1 and 2 in the outputs. Perhaps 1 represents regions that are more like squares or have a certain thickness, and 2 represents single-line (horizontal or vertical) structures.\n\nWait in Example 0's input, the region in rows 2-4, columns 1-4 (the 8s) form a sort of square or thicker block. The output for those is 1s. The horizontal lines (like in row 1) become 2s. Similarly, in Example 1, the regions that are more blocky (like the ones in row 2-4 columns 3-5) become 1s, while the horizontal lines (like row 1's 8s) become 2s. So maybe the rule is: if the 8s form a horizontal line of 3 or more, they become 2s. All other contiguous 8 regions become 1s. But wait, in Example 2's row 6, there's a horizontal line of three 8s (columns 3-5?), which becomes 1s. That contradicts that idea.\n\nWait, let's check Example 2's input and output. Test input row 6: [8,8,0,8,8,8,0...]. The output is [2,2,0,1,1,1,0...]. So the first two 8s become 2s (horizontal), then the next three 8s become 1s. Hmm, but the three 8s are horizontal. So that's conflicting. Maybe there's another factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the layer or the order in which regions are processed. Like, first process horizontal lines and mark them as 2s, then the remaining regions as 1s. But in Example 2's row 6, the first two 8s are adjacent and horizontal, marked as 2s. Then the next three 8s (columns 3-5) are a horizontal line, but in output they are 1s. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the direction of the line. For instance, horizontal lines (left-right) are 2s, vertical lines (up-down) are 1s. Let's see. In Example 0's row 2, the 8s are horizontal (4 in a row) but they become 1s. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: look for how the 8s are connected. Maybe regions that are connected only horizontally (like a single row) are 2s, and regions that have multiple rows (like a 2x2 block or larger) are 1s. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the 8s in row 1 (columns 7-9) are three in a row, no other 8s above or below. So they become 2s. The region in rows 2-4, columns 1-4 is a larger block with multiple rows. So those become 1s. Similarly, in Example 1, the horizontal line in row 1 is a single row, becomes 2s. The block in rows 2-4 (like columns 3-5) spans multiple rows, so they become 1s. That makes sense. Then in Example 2, the first two 8s in row 5 are horizontal, no vertical connection, so 2s. The next three in row 6 (columns 3-5) are horizontal, but maybe they are part of a larger vertical structure? Wait, in row 7 of Example 2's input, column 4 is 8. So the row 6's columns 3-5 (8,8,8) are connected to row 7's column 4 (8), forming a cross or T-shape. So that's a multi-row structure, hence becomes 1s. That fits. So the rule could be: if a group of 8s is a single horizontal line (no vertical connection), mark as 2. All other connected regions (those that have vertical connections or are not single-row lines) become 1s.\n\nTesting this with Example 2:\n\n- Row 1: 8,8,8 (horizontal, single row) \u2192 1s. Wait, but according to the output, it's 1s. Wait, that contradicts the hypothesis. Because in Example 2's output, row 1 is [0,1,1,1,0,...], which are three 8s in input. According to the previous idea, that's a single row, so should be 2s. But in the output, they are 1s. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, row 1 is [0,8,8,8,0,...], and in the output, those are 1s. So according to the previous idea, this would be a horizontal line, so 2s, but output is 1s. So that hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the numbers 1 and 2 are assigned based on the order in which regions are encountered. Like, the first connected region is 1, the next is 2, and so on. But in Example 0's output, there are both 1 and 2 regions. Let's check the input for the order. The first 8s in input (row 1) are three 8s. Then the next is the large block in rows 2-4. So if it's order-based, the first region (row 1) would be 1, but in the output, it's 2. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the 1s are for regions that are considered \"filled\" (like solid shapes) and 2s are for lines (either horizontal or vertical). For example, if a group of 8s has any cells with 8s in all four directions (like a 2x2 block), then it's considered filled and becomes 1s. Otherwise, if it's a straight line (horizontal or vertical), it becomes 2s. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 0's large block (rows 2-4, columns 1-4), there are cells that are surrounded on all sides, so this is a filled region \u2192 1s. The row 1's 8s are a single line \u2192 2s. Similarly, in Example 2's row 5: two 8s (input) are in a horizontal line with no vertical connections \u2192 2s. The three 8s in row 6 (columns 3-5) form a horizontal line connected to an 8 in row 7 (column 4), forming a T-shape. Since it's not a straight line (has a vertical connection), it's considered filled \u2192 1s. That makes sense.\n\nSo the rule could be: Any contiguous group of 8s that forms a straight horizontal or vertical line (without any branching) becomes 2s. All other contiguous groups (those with branches, L-shapes, etc.) become 1s. How to determine if a group is a straight line?\n\nAnother approach: For each connected region of 8s, check if all the cells are aligned in a single row (horizontal line) or a single column (vertical line). If yes \u2192 2. Otherwise \u2192 1.\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample 0:\n\n- Row 1's 8s: three in a horizontal line. All in same row \u2192 2s. Output is 2s. Correct.\n\n- Rows 2-4's 8s: form a shape that's not a straight line (it's a block). So 1s. Correct.\n\n- The lower part (rows 7-9) has a horizontal line of four 8s (row 7), then in row 8, the 8s are in columns 6 and 9, which is not a straight line. Wait, input rows 7-9:\n\nInput row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0]\n\nSo the group here is like a U-shape? So it's not a straight line \u2192 1s. Output for these is 1s. Correct.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput row 1 has four 8s in a horizontal line \u2192 2s. Correct.\n\nThe next group (rows 2-4) has a vertical structure. For example, row 2 has 8s in columns 0 (maybe typo in indexes?), wait the input for Example 1 is:\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8] \u2192 four 8s in a horizontal line \u2192 2s. Output row 1: 2s. Correct.\n\nRow 2: [0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,8,8] \u2192 the first four 8s in row 2 are a horizontal line, but connected to row 3's 8s. Row 3: [0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,8,8]. The 8s in columns 3-4 (row 2 and 3) form a vertical line. So the group includes both horizontal and vertical parts \u2192 not straight line \u2192 1s. Output rows 2-3: 1s. Correct.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput row 1: 8,8,8 in a horizontal line. But in the output, they are 1s. Wait, according to the rule, this should be a straight horizontal line \u2192 2s. But output is 1s. So this is a problem. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So maybe the rule is different. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: [0,8,8,8,0,...] \u2192 three 8s horizontal. Output: [0,1,1,1,0,...]. So they are 1s. According to previous idea, this should be 2s. So that's conflicting. So my previous idea is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the numbers 1 and 2 alternate based on the parity of the group's position. For example, the first group encountered is 1, the next is 2, etc. But in Example 0, there are two groups: the top-right 8s (output 2) and the larger block (output 1). So if the first group is 1, but in output it's 2. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in Example 0's input, the first group (row 1, columns 7-9) comes before the large block. So if the order is based on left-to-right, top-to-bottom scanning, the first group would be 1, but in output it's 2. So that's not.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the 1s represent regions that are \"enclosed\" or have a certain property, like being surrounded by zeros. But in Example 0's large block, it's connected to the edge. Not sure.\n\nLooking for another pattern. Let's look at the output's 1s and 2s. Maybe 1s represent the first occurrence of a region in each row or column. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the number of cells in each region. But in Example 0, the top-right group (3 cells) is 2s. The larger block (many cells) is 1s. Example 2's first group (3 cells) is 1s. So that's not.\n\nWait, perhaps the 2s are for horizontal lines, and 1s for vertical lines. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's input, the top-right 8s are horizontal \u2192 2s. Correct. The larger block includes vertical parts \u2192 1s. Correct. Example 1's input row 1 is horizontal \u2192 2s. Correct. Example 2's input row 1 is horizontal, but output is 1s. That's conflicting. So no.\n\nAnother angle: Let's consider the orientation of the first line in the group. For example, if a group starts with a horizontal line, it's 2; if vertical, 1. But I need to see.\n\nExample 2's input row 1: horizontal line \u2192 should be 2. Output is 1. So that's not.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe it's the other way around. Vertical lines become 1, horizontal become 2. But in Example 0, the horizontal lines are 2. But in Example 2's row 1, the horizontal line becomes 1. Confusion again.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the 2s are in regions where the 8s are in the same row and have no 8s above or below them. Like, isolated horizontal lines. Whereas 1s are regions that have 8s in multiple rows. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's top-right group (row 1, columns 7-9) are three 8s. No 8s in row 0 or row 2 in those columns. So isolated horizontal line \u2192 2s. Correct.\n\nThe large block (rows 2-4) has 8s in multiple rows \u2192 1s. Correct.\n\nIn Example 2's input row 1: three 8s in a row. What's above and below? Row 0: zeros. Row 2: [0,8,0,8,0...]. So row 2, column 1 is 8, which is below row 1's column 2 (8). So they are connected. So this group is part of a larger structure. So even though the row 1's 8s are horizontal, they are connected to 8s below, forming a vertical connection. So that's why they are 1s. Ah, that might be it!\n\nSo the rule is: For each connected region of 8s, if the entire region is a single horizontal line (all in the same row and no 8s vertically adjacent), then it becomes 2s. Otherwise, the region becomes 1s.\n\nBut how to check for vertical adjacency. Wait, a connected region includes all 8s connected via any direction (including diagonal?), but in these examples, the regions are connected orthogonally (up, down, left, right). So if a horizontal line of 8s has any 8s above or below them in the same region, then it's part of a non-horizontal group. So in Example 2's row 1, the three 8s are connected to the 8 in row 2, column 2 (assuming the 8s are connected vertically). Wait, let's look.\n\nIn Example 2's input:\n\nRow 1: columns 1-3 are 8s. Row 2: columns 1-3: 8,0,8. So row 2, column 1 is 8 (connected to row 1, column 1). So the entire region includes row 1's 8s and row 2's column 1 and 3. So this region is not a single horizontal line, so it's 1s. Hence, in output, they are 1s. That fits.\n\nAnother example: Example 2's row 5 has [8,8,0,0...]. These are two 8s in a row. Are they connected to any others below? Row 6, column 0-1: 8,8. So yes. So row 5's 8s are connected to row 6's 8s. So this group is not a single horizontal line \u2192 becomes 2s? Wait, no. In the output, row 5's 8s become 2s. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait in Example 2's input, rows 5-7 have:\n\nRow 5: [8,8,0,0,0,0...]\n\nRow 6: [8,8,0,8,8,8,0...]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,8,0,8,0...]\n\nSo the 8s in row 5 (columns 0-1) are connected to row 6's columns 0-1. Then in row 6, columns 3-5 are 8s. So the entire region is connected through row 6's columns 0-1 and 3-5. Wait, no, unless there's a diagonal connection. But assuming connection is only up, down, left, right.\n\nRow 5's 8s (0-1) are connected to row 6's 0-1, which are connected to row 6's 3-5 8s via left/right? No. So maybe there are two separate regions. Wait, in row 5, columns 0-1: 8,8. Row 6, columns 0-1: 8,8. That's connected vertically. Then row 6's columns 3-5: 8,8,8. Are those connected to any other 8s? In row 7, column 4 is 8. So row 6's column 4 is 8, connected to row 7's column 4. So those are part of a different region. So row 5's 8s (0-1) and row 6's 0-1 are one region. Row 6's 3-5 and row 7's 4 are another region.\n\nIn the output, row 5's 8s are mapped to 2s. Row 6's columns 0-1 are 2s (output row 6: [2,2,0,1,1,1,0...]). So the first region (rows 5-6, columns 0-1) is a vertical line (two rows of two 8s). So according to the rule, this is not a horizontal single line. So why is it 2s? Hmm, this breaks the previous hypothesis.\n\nWait, in the output, row 5's 8s are 2s. But according to the input, they are part of a vertical region. So that's conflicting. Maybe the rule is different. Perhaps any region that contains a horizontal line of 3 or more 8s is 2, else 1. But in Example 0's row 1, three 8s \u2192 2s. Example 1's row 1 has four \u2192 2s. Example 2's row 1 has three \u2192 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if a region has any horizontal line of three or more 8s, it's 2s. Otherwise 1s. Let's check.\n\nExample 0's top-right region (3 8s) \u2192 2s. Correct.\n\nExample 1's row 1 (four 8s) \u2192 2s. Correct.\n\nExample 2's row 1 (three 8s) \u2192 but output is 1s. So this is conflicting. So that's not the rule.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input row 1's 8s are three in a row, but they are connected to other 8s below (row 2's column 1 and 3). So the entire region includes more than a horizontal line, hence it's 1s. So even if there's a horizontal line of three, if it's part of a larger region that isn't just a horizontal line, it becomes 1s. So the rule is: if the entire region is a single horizontal line (no 8s above or below in the same region), then 2s; otherwise, 1s.\n\nBut how to determine if a region is entirely a horizontal line. So for example, the top-right region in Example 0 is a single horizontal line with no 8s above or below. So it's 2s.\n\nIn Example 2's row 5-6: the region in columns 0-1 is two rows of 8s (vertical), so not a single horizontal line \u2192 becomes 2s? But in the output, they are 2s. Hmm, but according to the rule, they should be 1s. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, in Example 2's output, the region in row 5-6, columns 0-1 are 2s. But this is a vertical line. So my previous rule doesn't apply. What's different here? Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 2s represent regions that are horizontal lines of length >=2, and 1s are other shapes. But in Example 0's row 7 has a horizontal line of four 8s (output 1s), which would be 2s according to this rule, but they are 1s. So no.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the key is to look at the test input and see what needs to be transformed.\n\nTest input:\n\nLooking at the test input, let's see where the 8s are:\n\nRow 1: 8,8 in columns 1-2, then 8,8,8 in columns 6-8 (but the row is [0,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,8,0]).\n\nRow 2: 8 in column 2, then 8 in column 8.\n\nRow 3: 8 in column 1 and 7.\n\nRow 4: 8,8,8 in columns 1-3, then 8,8,8,8 in columns 6-9.\n\nRow 6: 8,8,8 in columns 4-6.\n\nRow 7: 8 in column 5.\n\nRow 8: 8 in column 4.\n\nRow 9: 8,8,8,8 in columns 3-6.\n\nNow, trying to apply the pattern from training examples.\n\nLooking for regions that are horizontal lines. For example:\n\nRow 1's 8s: columns 1-2 are two 8s. Then columns 6-8 are three 8s. Are these part of larger regions?\n\nThe 8s in row 1, columns 1-2: check if they connect to any 8s below. Row 2's column 2 is 8. So they are connected. So this region is part of a vertical line. So they would become 1s.\n\nRow 1, columns 6-8: three 8s. Check if they connect to any 8s below. Row 2's column 8 is 8. So yes. So this region is part of a larger structure (not a single horizontal line) \u2192 1s.\n\nRow 4: columns 1-3 (8,8,8). Check if connected to anything above or below. Row 3's column 1 is 8. So yes. So this is part of a larger region \u2192 1s. Columns 6-9: four 8s in a row. Check if connected below. Row 5 is all zeros, row 6's columns 6-9 are zeros. So this is a horizontal line in row 4. Are there any 8s above? Row 3's column 7 is 8. So connected. So this is part of a larger structure. So 1s.\n\nRow 6: columns 4-6 (8,8,8). Check if connected. Row 5 is zeros. Row 7's column 5 is 8. So this region is connected vertically \u2192 becomes 1s.\n\nRow 7's 8 is in column 5. Connected to row 6's column 5 (8) and row 8's column 4 (8) maybe via diagonal? But assuming orthogonal connections only. So row 7's 8 is connected to row 6's column 5 (8). So this is part of a vertical line \u2192 1s.\n\nRow 8's 8 in column 4: connected to row 9's column 4 (which is part of a horizontal line of four 8s). So row 9's 8s (columns 3-6) are a horizontal line. Check if connected above. Row 8's column 4 is 8. So connected \u2192 part of a larger structure \u2192 1s.\n\nSo in the test input, most regions are connected vertically or in shapes that aren't purely horizontal lines. Are there any regions that are purely horizontal with no connections above or below?\n\nLooking at row 4's columns 6-9: four 8s. Check row 3's columns 6-9: zeros. Row 5's columns 6-9: zeros. So this is a horizontal line with no vertical connections. So according to the previous rule, this should be 2s.\n\nBut wait, row 4's columns 6-9 is connected to the 8 in column 7 of row 3? Let's check:\n\nRow 3: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]. So column 7 is 8. Row 4's column 7 is 8. So these are connected. So row 4's 8s in columns 6-9 are connected to row 3's column 7. So this region is not a pure horizontal line. So becomes 1s.\n\nThe only possible pure horizontal line in the test input is row 9's columns 3-6: four 8s. Check if they are connected to anything above. Row 8's column 4 is 8. So yes. So this region is connected to row 8's 8. So becomes 1s.\n\nWait, so are there any regions in the test input that are pure horizontal lines with no vertical connections?\n\nPerhaps row 6's columns 4-6 (8,8,8). Row 5 is zeros, row 7's column 5 is 8. So connected. So no.\n\nAnother possibility: row 1's columns 6-8 (8,8,8). Check if connected to any 8s below. Row 2's column 8 is 8. So yes. So connected. So no.\n\nHmm. So according to the previous pattern, there are no regions in the test input that are pure horizontal lines. So all regions become 1s. But that can't be, because in the training examples, some regions are 2s. But looking at the test input's output examples, there are both 1s and 2s. Wait, no, the test input may have some regions that are horizontal lines. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the region in row 4's columns 6-9 (four 8s) is connected to row 3's column 7. So the entire region includes row 3's column 7 and row 4's columns 6-9. This is a T-shape. So becomes 1s.\n\nIn the test input's row 9: columns 3-6 are four 8s. Check if connected to anything above. Row 8's column 4 is 8. So yes. So part of a larger region \u2192 1s.\n\nAre there any isolated horizontal lines in the test input? Let's look again.\n\nRow 4's columns 1-3: 8,8,8. Check above: row 3's column 1 is 8. So connected. So part of a larger region \u2192 1s.\n\nRow 1's columns 1-2: 8,8. Connected to row 2's column 2. So part of a larger region \u2192 1s.\n\nRow 1's columns 6-8: 8,8,8. Connected to row 2's column 8. So part of a larger region \u2192 1s.\n\nRow 7's column 5: connected to row 6's column 5. So part of a vertical line \u2192 1s.\n\nRow 8's column 4: connected to row 9's column 4. So part of a vertical line \u2192 1s.\n\nSo according to this, all regions in the test input are connected vertically or form non-horizontal shapes, so all would become 1s. But that contradicts the training examples where some regions are 2s. What am I missing?\n\nWait, perhaps there's another rule. For example, regions that are exactly three in a row horizontally become 2s, others become 1s. But in Example 0, the top-right 8s are three \u2192 2s. Example 2's row 1's three 8s \u2192 1s. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that if a region contains exactly three 8s in a horizontal line, it's 2s, else 1s. But that doesn't fit.\n\nLooking at the test input again. Row 4's columns 6-9 have four 8s in a horizontal line. If the rule is that any horizontal line of three or more becomes 2s, then these would be 2s. But according to the previous analysis, they are connected to row 3's column 7's 8, making the entire region not a pure horizontal line. But maybe the presence of any horizontal segment of three or more 8s makes the entire region 2s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire region is a horizontal line, but with other connected parts. But how to determine.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe the correct approach is to look for the pattern where each contiguous region of 8s is replaced with 1s if it's not a horizontal line, and 2s if it is. But considering that in Example 2's row 1, the horizontal line is part of a larger region, but becomes 1s, it's possible that the rule is that if the entire region is a horizontal line (no vertical connections), then 2s; otherwise, 1s.\n\nIn the test input, the only possible candidate for a 2 is maybe row 4's columns 6-9. But if that's connected to row 3's column 7, then it's part of a larger region and becomes 1s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that horizontal lines of any length are 2s, and other shapes are 1s. But in Example 0's row 7's horizontal line of four 8s becomes 1s. Which contradicts that.\n\nWait, in Example 0's row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0]. Output is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]. So horizontal line becomes 1s. So the rule is not about horizontal lines.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the outputs again for another pattern. For example, the outputs have 0s, 1s, and 2s. But all the input's 0s remain 0. The 8s are replaced with 1 or 2.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the 1s are the perimeter of the region, and 2s are the interior. But looking at Example 0's output, the large block is filled with 1s. Not perimeters.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s are for regions that are connected to the left or right edge of the grid, while 2s are for regions in the middle. But in Example 0's row 1's 8s are on the right edge (columns 7-9), and they become 2s. So that's not.\n\nWait, perhaps the 2s are for regions that are in the upper half of the grid and 1s for lower. But in Example 0's lower regions (rows 7-9) are 1s. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, the 2s often appear in the upper part of the grid. Example 0's row 1, Example 1's row 1. But Example 2's 2s are in row 5 and 6. So not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number alternates between 1 and 2 based on the region's position. First region 1, second region 2, etc. But in Example 0, the output has two regions: 2 and 1, which would imply first region is 2. Maybe the regions are ordered from top to bottom, left to right, and numbered 1 and 2 alternately. So first region is 2, second is 1, third is 2, etc. Let's check:\n\nExample 0 has two regions. First (top-right) is 2, second (large block) is 1. Then the lower regions (rows 7-9) are part of the third region, which would be 2. But in the output, they are 1s. So no.\n\nExample 1 has multiple regions. First (row 1) is 2, next (rows 2-4) is 1, then (rows 6-8) is 1 again. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's try to think differently. Maybe the 1s and 2s are based on the parity of the sum of coordinates of the region's cells. No, seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s and 2s represent different layers, with 1s being the first layer and 2s overlapping. But the outputs don't show overlapping.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's input and output, perhaps the 1s and 2s are based on the number of adjacent 8s. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the transformation is counting the number of cells in each region modulo something. But Example 0's top-right region has 3 cells \u2192 2. The large block has 14 cells (rows 2-4: each row has 4, then 2, then 4 \u2192 4+4+4? Wait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers 1 and 2 are assigned based on whether the region is adjacent to the top edge. But Example 0's top-right region is adjacent to the top edge (row 1) but output is 2. The large block is in row 2-4, not top edge \u2192 1. But Example 2's row 1's region is top edge and output is 1.\n\nThis isn't leading anywhere.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that regions that are to the right side of the grid are 2s, others are 1s. In Example 0, the top-right region is on the right \u2192 2. The large block is on the left \u2192 1. In Example 1, the first region is on the right \u2192 2. Other regions are left \u2192 1. Example 2's row 5's region is on the left \u2192 2. But in Example 2's output, the row 5's 8s are 2s. But the row 6's region (left) is also 2s. So this might fit. Then the test input's regions on the right would be 2s.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n- Row 1's columns 6-8: right side. If right regions are 2s, then this would be 2s. But according to previous analysis, these are connected to row 2's column 8's 8, which is part of a larger region. So perhaps the entire region would be 2 if it's on the right.\n\nBut in Example 2's row 5's region (left side) is 2s, so that contradicts.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in the outputs, whenever there's a horizontal line of 8s in the input that is isolated (not connected to other regions vertically), it becomes 2s. Otherwise, 1s. So in the test input, the only isolated horizontal line might be row 4's columns 6-9. Let me check if they are connected vertically.\n\nRow 4's columns 6-9 are 8s. Row 3's column 7 is 8. So they are connected. Hence, part of a larger region \u2192 1s.\n\nBut if there's no such isolated horizontal line in the test input, then all regions would be 1s. But in the training examples, some regions are 2s, so the test input must have some 2s.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the test input's row 9: 8,8,8,8 in columns 3-6. Are these connected to anything above? Row 8's column 4 is 8. So yes. So this is part of a larger region \u2192 1s.\n\nRow 6's columns 4-6: 8,8,8. Connected to row 7's column 5 \u2192 1s.\n\nThe only candidate for 2s would be if there's a horizontal line not connected vertically. Perhaps row 4's columns 6-9 are connected to row 3's column 7's 8. So the region is formed as follows:\n\nRow 3's column 7: 8.\n\nRow 4's columns 6-9: 8,8,8,8.\n\nSo these are connected. Hence, the region is not a horizontal line \u2192 1s.\n\nSo according to this, the test input's output would have all regions as 1s. But in the training examples, some are 2s. But this can't be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the first occurrence of a horizontal line in each row is 2, and others are 1s. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should proceed to make an educated guess based on the closest patterns observed.\n\nIn the training examples, isolated horizontal lines (not connected vertically) become 2s. All other regions become 1s.\n\nIn the test input, the regions that are horizontal lines and not connected vertically would be:\n\nRow 4's columns 6-9: four 8s. Check if connected to any 8s above or below. Row 3's column 7 is 8 (connected to row 4's column 7), so yes. So this is part of a larger region \u2192 1s.\n\nRow 9's columns 3-6: four 8s. Connected to row 8's column 4. So part of a larger region \u2192 1s.\n\nRow 6's columns 4-6: three 8s. Connected to row 7's column 5 \u2192 1s.\n\nSo perhaps the test input has no regions that are isolated horizontal lines. But this would mean all regions become 1s. But this is unlikely given the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test input has some regions that are horizontal lines and thus become 2s. For example, row 1's columns 6-8 (three 8s) are connected to row 2's column 8's 8, so not isolated. Row 4's columns 1-3 (three 8s) connected to row 3's column 1 \u2192 1s.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. I might have to make a best-guess answer based on the available examples. Given the time I've spent and the need to proceed, I'll assume that the pattern is: regions that are horizontal lines (regardless of connections) become 2s, others become 1s. But this would conflict with some examples, but perhaps that's the intended pattern.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow 1's columns 6-8: three 8s \u2192 2s.\n\nRow 4's columns 6-9: four 8s \u2192 2s.\n\nRow 6's columns 4-6: three 8s \u2192 2s.\n\nRow 9's columns 3-6: four 8s \u2192 2s.\n\nOther regions become 1s.\n\nBut according to the training examples, in Example 0, the horizontal line of three becomes 2s. Example 2's row 6's horizontal line of three becomes 1s. So this approach is inconsistent.\n\nAnother possibility: the pattern is that regions are replaced with 1s if they contain a 2x2 block of 8s, and 2s otherwise. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's large block has 2x2 regions \u2192 1s. The top-right horizontal line (no 2x2) \u2192 2s. Correct.\n\nExample 1's row 1: no 2x2 \u2192 2s. Other regions have 2x2? Let's see: rows 2-4's region has 8s in rows 2-3, columns 3-4 \u2192 2x2 \u2192 1s. Correct.\n\nExample 2's row 6: columns 3-5 (three 8s) \u2192 no 2x2. But output is 1s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not quite.\n\nAfter struggling for a long time, I think the correct pattern is that regions which are horizontal lines (connected horizontally and not vertically) become 2s. All other regions become 1s. But I need to apply this to the test input.\n\nIn the test input, the only possible horizontal line not connected vertically is row 4's columns 6-9. But row 3's column 7 is 8. So connected \u2192 1s. Row 9's columns 3-6 are connected to row 8's column 4 \u2192 1s. So perhaps there are no 2s in the output, but this is unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, in Example 2, the first two 8s in row 5 are connected to row 6's 8s. So that's a vertical connection, but in the output, they are 2s. This contradicts the previous idea.\n\nAt this point, I'm not confident but will proceed to create an answer based on the following pattern:\n\nRegions that are horizontal lines (even if part of a larger region) become 2s, other regions become 1s. But this is not perfect.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nRow 1's columns 6-8: three 8s \u2192 2s.\n\nRow 4's columns 6-9: four 8s \u2192 2s.\n\nRow 6's columns 4-6: three 8s \u2192 2s.\n\nRow 9's columns 3-6: four 8s \u2192 2s.\n\nOther regions become 1s.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, this might not fit. For example, Example 2's row 6's horizontal three 8s are part of a larger region and become 1s. So this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative conclusion: The pattern is to replace all 8s with 1s and 2s where 2s represent regions that are single-row horizontal lines (regardless of length), and 1s are other regions. But in Example 2's row 1's three 8s are part of a multi-row region but become 1s. So this is conflicting.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed to write the output based on the most plausible pattern I can find, even if I'm not fully confident.",
