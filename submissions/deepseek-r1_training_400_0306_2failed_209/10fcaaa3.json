        "cot_1": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the training examples and find how the input is transformed into the output, then apply that to the test input. Let's start by analyzing each example one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 0: The input has two rows. The first row is [0,0,0,0], and the second is [0,5,0,0]. The output has four rows, each twice the length. The first output row is [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0], which looks like inserting 8s and 0s alternately. The second row is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0], which seems like duplicating the original row and inserting 0s. Then the third row is the same as the first, and the fourth is the same as the second. So maybe the pattern is duplicating each row with some modification and interleaving with another pattern.\n\nExample 1's input has three rows. The output has six rows. The first output row is [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0], which seems like the original first row [0,0,6,0] duplicated but with some elements inserted. The second output row is all 8s. Then the third row is [0,6,0,8,...], which might be a combination of the input rows. Hmm, maybe there's a vertical expansion as well as horizontal. Also, the number 6 appears in certain positions, and 8s are filling in between.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is 5 rows. The output is 10 rows. Some rows in the output have 8s arranged in a pattern, and the original numbers (4s) are duplicated in certain positions. The output rows also alternate between patterns with 8s and the original numbers. Maybe each input row is transformed into multiple rows in the output, possibly mirroring or repeating with inserted 8s and 0s.\n\nExample 3's input has four rows. The output has eight rows. The first output row is similar to Example 0's pattern: 8s and 0s alternating. Then the second row is the original row duplicated with 0s. This repeats. It looks like each input row is converted into two output rows: one with the 8-0 pattern and another with the original elements duplicated and spaced with 0s. Then maybe the entire input is processed in a way that the number of output rows is double the input rows. But in Example 0, input rows are 2, output rows are 4. Example 1: input 3, output 6. Example 3: input 4, output 8. So that seems to fit. But Example 2's input has 5 rows, output 10. So yes, each row is transformed into two rows. But wait, in some examples like Example 1, the output has more rows than just double. Wait, example 1's input is 3 rows, output is 6 rows, which is 2x. Example 2's input is 5 rows, output is 10 rows. So that seems consistent. So the first part of the pattern is that each input row is transformed into two output rows. Then, the content of those rows depends on the original row.\n\nLooking at the content: For the first output row generated from an input row, maybe it's inserting 8s between the elements. For example, in Example 0, the input row [0,0,0,0] becomes [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. So each element is followed by an 8 and 0? Wait, the original is four elements, and the output row is eight elements. So each original element is replaced by two elements. Let's see: For the first input row of Example 0: each 0 becomes 8 and 0. So 0 \u2192 8,0. Then the next 0 \u21928,0, etc. So the first row would be [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. Then the second input row [0,5,0,0] becomes [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. Wait, that's not the same. Instead, it's like duplicating the original row but inserting something. Let's see: original [0,5,0,0] becomes [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. So the original is split into two copies of the original elements but with some overlap. Wait, the output row is the original elements followed by the same elements again. But in between, maybe there's a 0 added. Wait, original [0,5,0,0] is length 4. Output is length 8. So 4 elements \u2192 8 elements. So it's duplicated. So [0,5,0,0] becomes [0,5,0,0, 0,5,0,0]. But in the output, it's [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. Wait, that's the same as the original duplicated. So perhaps the first transformed row is inserting 8s and 0s, and the second transformed row is duplicating the original elements, adding 0s, or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first transformed row is an 8-0 pattern, and the second transformed row is the original elements followed by the same elements again but with some modification. For example, in Example 0's second row, input [0,5,0,0] \u2192 output [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. So it's the original row followed by [0,5,0,0], but the second part is shifted or has 0s in between? Not exactly. Let's see: the output is [0,5,0,0, 0,5,0,0]. So it's the original row concatenated with the same row. But that's just duplicating the row. But the 5 in the original appears twice in the output. So for each input row, the first transformed row is inserting 8 and 0 between each element, and the second transformed row is duplicating the original row elements (so each element appears twice). But wait, for example in Example 3's input row [0,2,0,0], the output's second row is [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0], which is the original row followed by [0,2,0,0]. So that's duplicating the original row but inserting some 0s in between?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first transformed row is inserting 8s and 0s, and the second transformed row is the original row elements interleaved with 0s. Wait, in Example 0's second input row, the second output row is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. If the original row is [0,5,0,0], then when duplicated, it would be [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. So the original elements are duplicated but with a 0 inserted between the two copies. Wait, the original is 4 elements. The output is 8 elements. So original elements followed by original elements again. So [0,5,0,0] becomes [0,5,0,0, 0,5,0,0]. So the 5 is present in the second position and the sixth position. So that's exactly duplicating the original row. So for each input row, the first transformed row is inserting 8 and 0 between each element (or replacing each element with 8 and 0), and the second transformed row is duplicating the original row (so each element is repeated once). But wait, in Example 0's first input row [0,0,0,0], the first transformed row is [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. So each 0 is replaced with 8 and 0. So 0 \u21928,0. Then the next 0 \u21928,0, etc. So that's expanding each element into two elements. Then for the second transformed row, perhaps the original row is duplicated. So each element is present twice. So 0 becomes 0,0. But in Example 0's second input row, the output is [0,5,0,0, 0,5,0,0]. So the 5 is present twice. So that's like taking the original row and appending another copy of the same row. So the total length doubles.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- Generate two rows in the output:\n\n   a. The first row replaces each element with 8 and 0. So if the original element is x, it becomes 8, 0. But wait, looking at Example 0's first input row [0,0,0,0], the first output row is [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. So each 0 is replaced by 8 and 0. So 0 \u21928,0.\n\n   b. The second row duplicates each element. So each element x becomes x, x. Wait, but in Example 0's second row, the input is [0,5,0,0], the second output row is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. Wait, that's not exactly duplicating each element. Wait, the original row is [0,5,0,0]. The output row is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. So if we split this into two parts, the first four elements are [0,5,0,0] (original), and the next four are [0,5,0,0]. So it's the original row followed by the same row. So it's concatenating the original row with itself. So the total length doubles. So if the original row is length n, the output row is length 2n. So that's the second transformed row.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the input row [0,5,0,0] becomes [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. Wait, the second part is [0,5,0,0] again. So that's exactly duplicating the original row. So the second row for each input row is the original row concatenated with itself. Then the first transformed row is replacing each element with 8 and 0.\n\nBut let's check other examples to confirm.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input. The first input row is [0,0,6,0]. The first output row is [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. So according to the second transformed row's rule, this would be the original row concatenated with itself. But [0,0,6,0] concatenated with [0,0,6,0] would be [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. Which matches the first output row. But according to the previous idea, the first transformed row should be replacing each element with 8 and 0. But in Example 1's output, the first row is [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0], which is the duplicated row, and the second row is all 8s. Wait, this seems different. Hmm, perhaps my initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the output has more rows than just 2 times the input. Wait, input has 3 rows, output has 6 rows. So each input row is transformed into two output rows. Let's look:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,6,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,6,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0] \u2192 this seems like input row 0 duplicated (original followed by original). But maybe it's the second transformed row (the duplicated one) for row 0. Then the next row (row 1 of output) is all 8s. Wait, that doesn't fit the previous pattern. So maybe there's a different pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation alternates between inserting 8s and duplicating rows, but with some additional rules when there are non-zero elements.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the second row is all 8s. That doesn't fit the previous idea. So maybe the pattern isn't as straightforward as applying two transformations per input row. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n0: [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0] \u2192 which is the first input row followed by [0,0,6,0] but with some changes. Wait, the original first input row is [0,0,6,0]. The output row is [0,0,6,0, 0,0,6,0]. So it's the same as the input row duplicated. Then the next output row (row 1) is all 8s. Then row 2 is [0,6,0,8, 0,6,0,8]. Hmm, this seems like a mix of input rows. Maybe the transformation involves interleaving rows with 8s and some copies of the input rows. This is getting complicated. Let's try to find another approach.\n\nAnother approach: Look for patterns in the output. For instance, the number 8 appears frequently. Maybe 8s are filling in new positions created by expanding the grid. The original input is a 2D grid, and the output is a larger grid. Let's consider that the output is created by expanding each cell into a 2x2 block. But how?\n\nIf each cell is expanded into 2x2, then each input row becomes two output rows, and each element in the input becomes two elements in the output. But the arrangement could vary. For example, a cell with value x could become:\n\n[x, something]\n\n[something, something]\n\nBut looking at Example 0's first input row [0,0,0,0], the first output row is [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. If each 0 is expanded into a 2x2 block where the top-left is 8 and the rest are 0s. Then, when expanded, each row would become two rows. For example, the first input row [0,0,0,0] would become:\n\nRow 1: 8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0 (each 0 \u2192 8 and 0 in the first row of the 2x2 block)\n\nRow 2: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 (the second row of the 2x2 blocks, all 0s)\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the first two rows are:\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\n[0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nWait, but the second input row is [0,5,0,0]. So maybe the 5 is part of the expansion. So perhaps when the original cell is non-zero, it's placed in the second row of the 2x2 block, and the first row has 8 and 0. For example, in the input row [0,5,0,0], each cell becomes:\n\nFor the first cell (0):\n\nRow 1: 8,0\n\nRow 2: 0,0\n\nFor the second cell (5):\n\nRow 1: 8,0\n\nRow 2: 5,0\n\nWait, but the output for this row is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. So the first row of the output for this input row is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by mirroring the input in some way. For example, each row is duplicated and interlaced with 8s. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 0's output:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,5,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: 8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0 (length 8)\n\nRow 1: 0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0 (length 8)\n\nRow 2: same as row 0\n\nRow 3: same as row 1\n\nSo the output is doubling the number of rows by repeating each input row twice, but each row is transformed. Wait, no: original has 2 rows, output has 4. So each input row is transformed into two output rows, but then the output repeats the transformed rows again. So maybe each input row's transformed pair is repeated once. But this isn't the case in other examples. For example, Example 3's input has 4 rows, output has 8 rows. So each input row becomes two output rows, and that's it. So perhaps the pattern is that each input row is transformed into two output rows: one with the 8-0 pattern, and another with the original elements duplicated. Then, the entire output is the concatenation of these transformed rows.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 6 rows. Input has 3 rows, so 3*2=6 rows. Let's see:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,6,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,6,0,0]\n\nSo transformed rows would be:\n\nFor row 0: first transformed row would be inserting 8s and 0s. So replacing each element with 8,0. So [8,0,8,0, 8,0,8,0]. Second transformed row would be duplicating the original row: [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0].\n\nBut looking at Example 1's output:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0] \u2192 which is the duplicated row (second transformed row of input row 0).\n\nRow 1: all 8s \u2192 this doesn't fit. So perhaps this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first transformed row is the duplicated row, and the second transformed row is the 8s and 0s. But in Example 0, the first output row is the 8-0 pattern, then the second row is the duplicated row. So maybe the order is reversed. For each input row, the first output row is the 8-0 pattern, and the second is the duplicated row. Then, for example, in Example 0, input has two rows. Each becomes two output rows, so total four.\n\nBut in Example 1, input has three rows, transformed into six. Let's see:\n\nInput row 0: [0,0,6,0]\n\nTransformed row a: 8-0 pattern \u2192 [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nTransformed row b: duplicated \u2192 [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]\n\nSimilarly for other rows. Then, the output rows would be the a and b rows for each input row. Let's check Example 1's output:\n\nLooking at the output rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0] \u2192 which matches row b for input row 0.\n\nRow 1: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8] \u2192 this is all 8s. So this doesn't fit either a or b for input row 1. Because input row 1 is [0,0,0,0]. Its a row would be [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0], and b row would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But the output row 1 is all 8s. So that doesn't align. Hmm, so maybe the pattern is more complex.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the positions of non-zero numbers. For example, in Example 0's input, the 5 is in position (1,1). In the output, the 5 appears in positions (1,1) and (1,5). So it's duplicated with an offset of 4. Since the output row is twice the length, the duplication occurs every four elements. So perhaps when the input has a non-zero element, it's duplicated in the output row in the original position and the same position plus the original length. For example, input length 4: positions 0,1,2,3. Output length 8: positions 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. So the original 1st position becomes positions 1 and 5. So for input row [0,5,0,0], the output row would have 5s at positions 1 and 5. Which matches Example 0's second output row [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0].\n\nSo the duplicated non-zero elements are placed in the original position and the position plus half the output row length. So for a row of length n, the output row is length 2n. Each non-zero element at position i is placed at i and i + n. For example, in Example 0's second output row, the 5 is at position 1 and 5 (1+4=5). So the output row is created by taking the original elements and placing them at their original positions and positions +n, while filling the rest with 0s.\n\nBut the first output row for each input row seems to have 8s alternating with 0s. Like for input row [0,0,0,0], the first output row is [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. So alternating 8 and 0. Which suggests that for each element in the input, the first output row has 8 followed by 0. So each element is replaced by 8,0. Then, the second output row is the original elements duplicated in their positions and positions +n, with 0s elsewhere.\n\nSo the transformation for each input row is two output rows:\n\n- Row A: Replace each element with 8, 0. So the original element's value is irrelevant here. All elements are replaced with 8 and 0.\n\n- Row B: For each non-zero element in the original row, place them at their original position and original position + n (where n is the original row length). Fill the rest with 0s.\n\nThen, the output for the entire input is the concatenation of these pairs (Row A and Row B) for each input row.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nExample 0:\n\nInput row 0: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow A: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow B: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (since all elements are 0, duplication doesn't add anything)\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the first two rows are:\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\n[0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nWait, that's row B from input row 1. So perhaps the input rows are processed one after another, each generating two output rows. So input row 0 generates Row A and Row B (which is all 0s), then input row 1 generates its own Row A and Row B. But in Example 0's output, the first two rows are for input row 0 (Row A) and input row 1 (Row B). But that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the two output rows per input row are stacked. For example, input row 0's Row A and Row B, then input row 1's Row A and Row B. But in Example 0's output:\n\nOutput rows:\n\n0: Row A of input row 0\n\n1: Row B of input row 1\n\n2: Row A of input row 0 again?\n\n3: Row B of input row 1 again.\n\nHmm, no. The output is repeating the transformed rows. So this approach may not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by first transforming each input row into Row A and Row B, then for each transformed Row A and Row B, we repeat them once. For example, in Example 0, input row 0 becomes Row A and Row B (all 0s), then input row 1 becomes Row A and Row B. But the output is:\n\nRow 0: Row A of input row 0\n\nRow 1: Row B of input row 1\n\nRow 2: Row A of input row 0\n\nRow 3: Row B of input row 1\n\nSo this would require that each input row's transformed rows are interleaved with other rows. But this is getting too convoluted. Let's look at another example.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] \u2192 Row A of input row 0\n\nRow 1: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] \u2192 Row B of input row 1\n\nRow 2: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] \u2192 Row A of input row 0 again\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 Row B of input row 2 or 3?\n\nWait, input row 2 and 3 are all zeros. So their Row B would be all zeros. So output row 3 is Row B of input row 3?\n\nBut the output has eight rows, which is 4 input rows \u00d7 2. So each input row is transformed into two rows. Let's see:\n\nInput row 0 \u2192 Row A: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0], Row B: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nInput row 1 \u2192 Row A: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0], Row B: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0]\n\nInput row 2 \u2192 Row A: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0], Row B: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nInput row 3 \u2192 Row A: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0], Row B: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nBut the output rows are:\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] (Row A of input 0)\n\n[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] (Row B of input 1)\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] (Row A of input 0 again?)\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (Row B of input 2)\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] (Row A of input 0 again?)\n\n[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] (Row B of input 1 again)\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] (Row A of input 0 again?)\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (Row B of input 3?)\n\nThis doesn't align with the input rows. So maybe the pattern isn't simply transforming each input row into two output rows.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for vertical patterns. For example, the output rows may be arranged in a way that mirrors the input rows vertically. For instance, in Example 0, the input has two rows. The output has four rows, which are two copies of the transformed input rows. So first transformed row of input 0, then transformed row of input 1, then transformed row of input 0 again, then transformed row of input 1 again. So the output is repeating the transformed input rows twice. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by expanding each cell into a 2x2 block where:\n\n- The top-left cell is 8 if the original cell is 0.\n\n- The top-right cell is 0.\n\n- The bottom-left cell is 0 if the original cell is non-zero.\n\n- The bottom-right cell is the original value.\n\nWait, not sure. Let's take Example 0's input cell (1,1) which is 5. Expanding this into 2x2:\n\nTop-left: 8 (since original is 0?), but cell (1,1) in input is 5. Wait, maybe if the original cell is non-zero, the 2x2 block has that value in the bottom-right and 8s elsewhere. For example:\n\nIf cell x is non-zero:\n\n8 x\n\n8 x\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the second row is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. So the 5 appears in the second row's positions 1 and 5. If each cell is expanded into two rows and two columns, then perhaps the non-zero value is placed in the second row of the 2x2 block, and the first row has 8 and 0.\n\nAlternatively, think of each input row being converted into two output rows, and each element into two columns. So for each input element, you generate two columns. For example:\n\nIf the input element is 0, then in the first output row, you have 8 and 0. In the second output row, 0 and 0.\n\nIf the input element is non-zero (e.g., 5), then in the first output row, 0 and 0. In the second output row, 5 and 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's second input row [0,5,0,0], the output row is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. The second output row for this input row would be [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0], which suggests that the 5 is duplicated in the same position and shifted by the length of the row. So for a row of length 4, the 5 at position 1 is duplicated at position 1 and 5 (1+4).\n\nSo for non-zero elements, in their corresponding output row (row B), they are placed at positions i and i + n (original row length), and others are 0. For zeros in the input, the output row A is 8 and 0 for each element. But how to explain the other examples.\n\nThis seems to align with Example 0's output. Let's check Example 1.\n\nExample 1's input row 0: [0,0,6,0]\n\nRow B would be [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0] (6 at positions 2 and 6 (2+4=6)). Which matches the first output row.\n\nThe second input row is [0,0,0,0], so row B would be all zeros. But the second output row in Example 1 is all 8s. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm. So maybe the row A (first transformed row) is generated differently. If the input element is 0, row A is 8 and 0. If non-zero, row A is 0 and 8? Or something else.\n\nWait, Example 1's input row 2 is [0,6,0,0]. Its row B would be [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0]. The third output row in Example 1 is [0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8]. This has 8s in positions 3 and 7. Which doesn't fit the previous pattern. So perhaps the row A for this input row has 8s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, the row A and row B for each input row depend on the presence of non-zero elements. For example, if an input row has a non-zero element, then row A is filled with 8s in certain positions. But this is getting too vague.\n\nLet's look for another pattern. The 8s seem to form a border or a checkerboard pattern. In Example 0's first output row, 8 and 0 alternate. In Example 1's second output row, all 8s. In Example 3's output, certain rows have alternating 8s and 0s. Maybe the 8s are part of a background pattern that is generated around the non-zero elements.\n\nAnother observation: The number of rows in the output is double the number of rows in the input. For example:\n\nExample 0: 2 input rows \u2192 4 output rows.\n\nExample 1: 3 input rows \u2192 6 output rows.\n\nExample 2: 5 input rows \u2192 10 output rows.\n\nExample 3: 4 input rows \u2192 8 output rows.\n\nSo each input row corresponds to two output rows. So the vertical dimension is doubled. Similarly, the horizontal dimension is doubled, as each input row of length n becomes output rows of length 2n.\n\nSo the transformation involves scaling the input grid by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. How is each cell scaled?\n\nIf each cell in the input is scaled to a 2x2 block in the output, then:\n\nFor a cell x:\n\n- If x is zero, the 2x2 block is filled with 8s and 0s in a certain pattern.\n\n- If x is non-zero, the 2x2 block has x in certain positions and 0s elsewhere.\n\nFor example, in Example 0, the 5 is in position (1,1). In the output, this becomes two rows. The output row for this cell would have 5 in the second row's first column of the 2x2 block. But this is just speculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe non-zero elements are placed in the even or odd rows and columns. Let's take Example 0's output:\n\nThe second output row is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. The 5s are in positions 1 and 5. These are even indices (if starting at 0), but 1 is odd. Wait, positions are 0-based. So 1 is the second position. 1 mod 2 is 1. 5 mod 4 (since original row length is 4) is 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, non-zero elements are duplicated in the output at positions (2i, 2j) and (2i+1, 2j+1), but this is just a guess.\n\nPerhaps the key is that non-zero elements are placed in specific positions when expanded, and zeros are replaced with 8s and 0s in a checkerboard pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the 8s are forming a background pattern, and the non-zero elements are overlaid on top of this pattern. For example, the first transformed row for each input row is a checkerboard of 8 and 0, and the second transformed row has the non-zero elements duplicated and filled with 0s otherwise.\n\nBut this is still unclear. Let's try to think of the test input and see if applying a possible pattern gives the expected output.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,3,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,0,0,0]\n\nSo six input rows. According to the pattern of doubling the rows, the output should have 12 rows.\n\nEach input row is transformed into two output rows. Let's assume that for each input row, the first output row is the 8-0 alternating pattern, and the second output row is the duplicated row with non-zero elements placed at their original position and original + length.\n\nFor example, input row 0: [0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow A: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow B: [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0] (duplicating the original row's non-zero elements. Original length 5, so positions 1 and 1+5=6. So 3 is at 1 and 6. The rest are zeros.)\n\nSimilarly, input row 5: [0,3,0,0,0]. Row B would have 3s at positions 1 and 6.\n\nBut in the test input, there are three rows with 3s: rows 0, 3, and 5. Their transformed Row B would have 3s at positions 1 and 6 for each of those rows.\n\nBut let's see what the output would look like.\n\nApplying the pattern:\n\nFor each input row, generate two output rows:\n\nRow A: Each element replaced with 8,0. So for a row of length 5, Row A would be 10 elements, 8 followed by 0 repeated.\n\nRow B: Each non-zero element is placed at i and i+5 (original length is 5).\n\nSo for input row 0: [0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow B: [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nSimilarly, input row 3: [0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow B: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0] (3 at positions 3 and 8 (3+5=8).\n\nInput row 5: same as row 0.\n\nSo the output would have 12 rows, each of length 10.\n\nBut the output from the training examples sometimes has additional 8s. For example, Example 1's output has rows with all 8s. So perhaps there's more to the pattern. Maybe when there are non-zero elements in adjacent rows, additional 8s are inserted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformed rows are interleaved with additional rows filled with 8s. For example, in Example 1's output, between the transformed rows of input rows, there are rows of all 8s.\n\nBut this makes the pattern more complex.\n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis: each input row becomes two output rows, where Row A is 8 and 0 alternating, and Row B is the duplicated non-zero elements at positions i and i+n. Let's try to apply this to the test input.\n\nTest input has 6 rows. So output should be 12 rows.\n\nFor each input row:\n\nRow A: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] (length 10)\n\nRow B: For each non-zero element in input row, place them at positions i and i+5.\n\nLet's process each input row:\n\nRow 0: [0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow A: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow B: [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow A: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow B: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSame as row 1.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,3,0]\n\nRow A: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow B: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSame as row 1.\n\nRow 5: [0,3,0,0,0]\n\nSame as row 0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow 0: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 10: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow 11: [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, the outputs often have more 8s and some rows with 8s in different patterns. For example, in Example 1's output, there's a row of all 8s. According to our current pattern, that would correspond to an input row of all zeros. But in Example 1's input, there is a row of all zeros, and its Row A would be [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0], not all 8s. So our pattern is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that the 8s are part of a background grid that's overlaid with the non-zero elements. So the output grid is filled with 8s in a certain pattern, and the non-zero elements from the input are placed in specific positions. For example, each non-zero element in the input is placed in the output at positions (2i, 2j), and the surrounding cells are 8s. But this is a common pattern in image scaling.\n\nFor instance, in Example 0's input cell (1,1) with 5 would be placed at (2,2) in the output, and the surrounding cells would be 8s. But this would require that each cell is expanded into a 2x2 block. Let's see:\n\nIf each cell (i,j) in the input becomes a 2x2 block in the output:\n\noutput_row = 2i\n\noutput_col = 2j\n\nThen, for a cell x:\n\noutput_block would be:\n\n[x, 8]\n\n[8, 8]\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's check Example 0's input:\n\nInput row 1: [0,5,0,0]\n\nSo cell (1,1) is 5. The output for this row would be two rows. For the first row of the block (output row 2i), and columns 2j:\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother possibility: The output is generated by inserting a new row of 8s between each input row and then expanding the columns by inserting 8s as well. But not sure.\n\nAt this point, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis and see if the test input's expected output matches.",

        "cot_2": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is transformed into an output with more rows and columns. Let's start by examining the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has two rows: [0,0,0,0] and [0,5,0,0]. The output is four rows, each of length 8. The first output row is [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0], then [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0], then repeats the first two rows again. So it looks like the output is doubling the columns by mirroring each row, then adding some rows. Wait, but the original input rows are [0,0,0,0] and [0,5,0,0], and the output rows seem to be each original row concatenated with itself. For example, [0,5,0,0] becomes [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. So the columns are doubled by repeating the row. But then there are additional rows. Also, the first row of the input becomes the first row of the output, but then there's another row with 8s and 0s. Wait, the first input row is all zeros, but the output has a row starting with 8 and alternating 0s. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe each input row is transformed into multiple output rows. Let me look again. The input has two rows, and the output has four rows. The output seems to alternate between the original row (possibly duplicated) and new rows with 8s. For example, in Example 0, the output rows are:\n\nRow 1: 8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0 \u2192 this is a pattern of 8 and 0 alternating, but perhaps based on the original input row. The original first input row is all zeros. Maybe inserting 8s between them? But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by interleaving new rows between the input rows. Let's check the second example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has three rows: [0,0,6,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,6,0,0]. The output has six rows. Let's see the output:\n\nFirst row: [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0] \u2192 seems like the first input row is duplicated and concatenated, but with some elements added? Wait, original is [0,0,6,0], duplicated would be [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0], which matches. So each input row is duplicated in columns by doubling the elements. Then the next row is all 8s. Then the third row is [0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8], which combines the third input row with some 8s. Hmm. Maybe there's a pattern where each input row is expanded into two output rows: one being the original row duplicated, and another being a transformed version with 8s. But it's not straightforward.\n\nLooking at the outputs, 8s seem to appear in certain positions. Maybe it's related to the positions of non-zero numbers in the input. For example, in Example 0, the 5 is in the second row, second column. In the output, the 5s are duplicated in the same position in the duplicated columns, and the other rows have 8s in alternating positions.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is constructed by mirroring the input both horizontally and vertically, inserting 8s in certain places. For instance, each input row is mirrored to double the columns, then the rows are mirrored with some transformations. Let's check Example 0:\n\nInput rows after mirroring (doubling columns) would be:\n\nFirst row [0,0,0,0] becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but in the output, it's [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. So that's not just mirroring. Maybe inserting 8s between the original elements. For a row of four elements, inserting 0s and 8s alternately? Wait, the first output row in Example 0 is [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. If the original row is four elements, maybe each element is replaced by 8 followed by the original element. So for [0,0,0,0], replacing each 0 with 8 and 0, giving [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. Then the next row is [0,5,0,0] transformed into [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0] by duplicating the row. Then the pattern repeats those two rows again. So the output is doubling the rows as well. So for Example 0, the input has two rows. The output has four rows, which is two times the original. Each input row is transformed into two output rows: one with 8s and 0s alternating, and the original row duplicated. Wait, no. Because in the output, the first row is the transformed row (8s and 0s), the second is the original duplicated. Then repeat. So for two input rows, each becomes two output rows, leading to four output rows. But in Example 0, the output is four rows, which is two times the input's two rows. But how are the transformed rows generated?\n\nWait, perhaps the transformed rows are generated by inserting 8s between the original elements. For example, if the original row has n elements, the transformed row has 2n elements where each original element is followed by 8 or vice versa. Let me check. In Example 0, the first input row is [0,0,0,0]. The transformed row is [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. So each original element (0) is replaced by 8 and 0. So 0 becomes 8,0. Then the original row is duplicated in columns (so [0,5,0,0] becomes [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]). Then the transformed rows (with 8s) and the duplicated rows alternate. Also, the output rows are twice the length of the input rows. So the process is: each input row is duplicated in columns (so each element is followed by a copy?), but perhaps the transformation depends on the original elements. Wait, but in Example 0's second row, the 5 is duplicated in the same position in both halves. So [0,5,0,0] becomes [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. So the row is mirrored, but the 5 appears in the second and sixth positions (since original position 1 (0-indexed) is mirrored). Wait, original row has four elements. When duplicated, positions 0-3 become 0-3 and 4-7 (mirroring). But the 5 is at index 1 in the original, so duplicated at index 1 and 1+4=5? So that's why it's at positions 1 and 5 in the output row. So the column duplication is simply appending the same row again. So each input row is turned into a row of double the length by appending itself. Then, between these duplicated rows, there are rows filled with 8s and 0s in some pattern.\n\nBut in Example 0's output, the first row is all 8s and 0s, then the second row is the duplicated row. Then the third row is the 8s/0s again, then the fourth row is the duplicated row again. Wait, but the input has two rows, and the output has four rows. So each input row is generating two output rows: one transformed (with 8s) and one duplicated. Wait, but the first input row [0,0,0,0] becomes the first output row [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0], then the second output row is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. Then the third output row is [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] again, and the fourth is the second input row duplicated again. So each input row is generating two rows in the output: transformed and duplicated. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by alternating between a \"border\" row (with 8s) and the original rows duplicated. But the transformed rows aren't all 8s. Wait in Example 0's output, the first and third rows are the same, which is the transformed row. The second and fourth rows are the duplicated original rows. So for each input row, perhaps the output adds a transformed row followed by the duplicated original row. But in Example 0, the first input row (all zeros) becomes the transformed row, and the second input row (with 5) becomes the duplicated row. Then the pattern repeats. So maybe each input row is followed by a transformed row. Wait, but in Example 0, there are two input rows, leading to four output rows. So each input row produces two output rows: transformed and duplicated. But how?\n\nAnother angle: looking at Example 1's input. The input has three rows. The output has six rows. So 3 input rows \u2192 6 output rows. So each input row generates two output rows. Let's see:\n\nInput row 0: [0,0,6,0] \u2192 Output row 0: [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0] (duplicated). Output row 1: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8] (all 8s). Then input row 1: [0,0,0,0] \u2192 Output row 2: [0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8], but wait, that doesn't fit. Or maybe the pattern is more complex. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by inserting transformed rows between the original rows. For instance, each original row is followed by a transformed row. But how? The transformed rows in Example 1 include rows with 8s and others. Maybe the transformation depends on the presence of non-zero elements. For example, when a non-zero element is present in the input row, it affects the placement of 8s in the transformed rows.\n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of layers. The outputs might be expanding the input grid by inserting 8s around the non-zero elements. But how?\n\nAnother thought: in the output, the non-zero numbers from the input are duplicated in the duplicated rows. For example, in Example 0, the 5 is duplicated in the same positions in the duplicated rows. So maybe the output is a kind of tiling where each original cell is expanded into a 2x2 block. But how?\n\nWait, for a cell in the input, in the output, each cell could be represented as a 2x2 block. For example, if the input is 2x4, the output is 4x8, which is 2x2 blocks for each original cell. Then, each original cell's value is placed in the top-left of the 2x2 block, and 8s are filled around them. But looking at Example 0: the input cell with 5 is in (1,1). In the output, the 5 is in row 1, column 1 and 5 (since the duplicated row is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. So that's two copies of the original row. So each row is duplicated in columns, which suggests that each element is placed in two positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is created by mirroring the input grid both horizontally and vertically, with certain transformations. For example, each original row is mirrored to create the doubled columns, and then rows are mirrored with added 8s.\n\nWait, let's take Example 0's input:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,5,0,0]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nSo, the original rows are each duplicated twice. But the first and third output rows are the transformed ones. So the pattern is that for each input row, we create two output rows: one transformed with 8s and 0s alternating, and one that duplicates the original row's elements in the columns. But how is the transformed row generated?\n\nLooking at the transformed row in Example 0: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. This could be generated by inserting 8 and 0 alternately, but the original row is all zeros. Maybe the transformed row is generated as 8s in even positions and 0s in odd, but that's just a guess. Let's check another example.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has a row [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], which is all 8s. So maybe when the original row is all zeros, the transformed row is all 8s. Wait, no. In Example 0, the original row is all zeros, and the transformed row is alternating 8 and 0. So that theory is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformed row is created by replacing each 0 in the original row with 8 and 0 alternately. For example, each 0 becomes 8 followed by 0. So if the original row is [0,0,0,0], replacing each 0 with [8,0], the transformed row becomes [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0], which matches Example 0. Then, for a row with a non-zero element, like [0,5,0,0], the transformed row would have 8 in even positions, but how? Wait, in Example 0's second row, the transformed row is the same as the first transformed row. But the original row has a 5. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 3. The input is four rows. The output has eight rows. The first output row is [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0], which again is the same pattern as Example 0's transformed row. The second output row is [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0], which is the original row duplicated. Then it repeats. So in this case, each input row is generating two output rows: the transformed (8s and 0s) and the duplicated row. So the pattern seems to be: for each input row, output two rows. The first row is generated by inserting 8 and 0 alternately for each original element (each 0 becomes 8 and 0, and non-zero elements are kept as is?), and the second row is the original row duplicated (each element appears twice in a row).\n\nWait, let's test this hypothesis. For Example 0's first input row [0,0,0,0], the transformed row would be each 0 replaced by 8 and 0. So each 0 becomes 8 and 0, leading to [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. Then the duplicated row would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the output row is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. Wait, that's not matching. So maybe the duplicated row is the original row concatenated with itself. So [0,5,0,0] becomes [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0], which is appending the same row again. But why is the 5 duplicated? Because when you concatenate the row, the 5 is in the same position in the first half and the second half. So for the duplicated row, each element is present in the first half and the second half. So the duplicated row is the original row followed by the same row again.\n\nBut then, the transformed row is generated by replacing each element in the original row with 8 followed by 0. Wait, but in Example 1, the third input row is [0,6,0,0], which becomes [0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8] in the output. Wait, that's not following the pattern. Let's see. The original row is [0,6,0,0]. If we replace each element with 8 and 0, it would be [8,0,6,0,8,0,0,0], but that doesn't match. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformed rows are generated by some pattern that involves placing 8s in the even indices and the original elements in the odd indices. For example, in Example 0's first transformed row: 8,0,8,0... which would be even indices (0,2,4,6) as 8, odd as 0. But the original row was all zeros. How does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, the transformed row is a checkerboard pattern of 8s and 0s. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output dimensions. For the input examples:\n\nExample 0: Input is 2x4 \u2192 Output is 4x8.\n\nExample 1: Input is 3x4 \u2192 Output is 6x8.\n\nExample 2: Input is 5x3 \u2192 Output is 10x6.\n\nExample 3: Input is 4x4 \u2192 Output is 8x8.\n\nSo the output has twice the number of rows and columns as the input. Wait:\n\nWait, Example 0 input is 2 rows, 4 columns. Output is 4 rows (2x2) and 8 columns (4x2). Similarly, Example 1's input is 3 rows \u2192 output 6 rows (3x2), columns 4 \u21928 (4x2). Example 2's input is 5 rows \u2192 output 10 rows (5x2), 3 columns \u21926 (3x2). Example 3's input is 4 rows \u21928 rows (4x2), columns 4\u21928 (4x2). So the output dimensions are 2x the input dimensions. So each input element is mapped to a 2x2 block in the output.\n\nSo, the output is a 2x scaling of the input. Now, how each 2x2 block is filled depends on the input value. For example, if the input cell is non-zero, perhaps the 2x2 block duplicates that value in certain positions. If the input cell is zero, the 2x2 block is filled with 8s and 0s in a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input row (all zeros), each 0 becomes a 2x2 block. The output row for these blocks is [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0], which suggests that each 0 is replaced by 8 and 0 alternately. Wait, but the output row has two elements per original cell. For example, each 0 in the input becomes 8 and 0 in the output. So each cell is replaced by two elements: 8 and 0. Then the next row in the same block is 0 and 0? Or maybe each cell is a 2x2 block, but in rows, it's spread out.\n\nWait, perhaps each input cell becomes a 2x2 block in the output. For example, a cell with value 0 becomes:\n\n8 0\n\n0 8\n\nBut when arranged in rows, this would translate to:\n\nFirst row of the block: 8 0 8 0 ...\n\nSecond row: 0 8 0 8 ...\n\nBut looking at Example 0's output, the first row is [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0], and the third row is the same. The second row is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. So the input cell with 5 is in the second row. So perhaps the 5's block is:\n\n0 5\n\n5 0\n\nWhich when duplicated gives [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0] for the row. Wait, but the output row for the 5's row is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0], which is the original row followed by itself again. So each cell is duplicated twice in the same row, leading to the row being doubled in columns.\n\nBut then, the transformed rows (with 8s) are generated by some other pattern. For example, in Example 0's first row (all zeros), the transformed rows are [8,0,8,0...], which could be each cell's block as 8 in the first position and 0 in the second. Then, when arranged in rows, the first row of the block is 8 0, and the second row is 0 8. But in the output, the first transformed row is [8,0,8,0...], and the third row is the same. So that suggests that each input row is generating two output rows. The first output row is the top part of each 2x2 block, and the second output row is the bottom part. Then, each input row is generating two output rows. So for Example 0's input, which has two rows, the output has four rows.\n\nBut how to determine what's in each part of the block. For a zero input cell, the block could be:\n\n8 0\n\n0 8\n\nSo the first output row from this block is 8 and 0, and the second output row is 0 and 8. For a non-zero input cell, the block could be:\n\nvalue 0\n\n0 value\n\nSo for example, input 5 would be:\n\n5 0\n\n0 5\n\nWhich would, when duplicated in rows, create [5,0,5,0...] and [0,5,0,5...]. But in Example 0's output, the row with 5 is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. So perhaps this is not the case. Alternatively, maybe the non-zero value is duplicated in both positions of the block. For example:\n\nvalue value\n\nvalue value\n\nWhich when transformed would give the same value in each position of the block. But in Example 0's output, the row with 5 is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0], which suggests that the 5 is only in the second and sixth positions (original and duplicated). Wait, the input row is [0,5,0,0], which when duplicated becomes [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. So the 5 is present in the second and sixth positions. So the duplicated row is just the original row followed by the same row again. So the columns are doubled by duplicating each element next to itself. But how does that fit with the 2x scaling?\n\nAlternatively, when the input is scaled by 2x in columns, each element is placed twice in a row. For example, [0,5,0,0] becomes [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0], which is doubling the row by repeating each element once. But why the 5 is in the second and sixth positions? Because the original row is four elements, so when duplicated, it's 8 elements. The 5 is in position 1 (0-based) in the original, so in the duplicated row, positions 1 and 5 (1 +4) would have 5.\n\nSo columns are doubled by appending the same row again. So each row in the input is duplicated in columns. Then, the rows are also duplicated, but with some transformed rows in between.\n\nBut how are the transformed rows generated? Looking at Example 0's transformed row [8,0,8,0...], which is 8 followed by 0 repeated. This pattern could be generated by replacing each element in the original row with 8 and 0. But the original elements are zeros. So perhaps for zeros, the transformed row alternates 8 and 0, but for non-zero elements, the transformed row has the non-zero element followed by 0 or 8?\n\nBut in Example 1, the third output row is [0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8]. The input row here is [0,6,0,0]. So when transformed, each element is replaced by itself followed by 8 if it's non-zero, and 0 otherwise. So for the 6, it becomes 6 followed by 8. For zeros, it's 0 followed by 0. So the transformed row would be [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0], but in the example, it's [0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the non-zero elements are replaced with their value and 8. So 6 becomes 6,8. So the transformed row would be [0,6,8,0,0,6,8,0]. But the example's third row is [0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8]. So perhaps even positions are original elements, and odd positions are 8 if the previous element was non-zero, or 0 otherwise.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find another pattern. The 8s seem to appear in positions where there's a zero in the original input, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the transformed rows are created by inserting 8s between the original elements. For example, each element is followed by an 8. But in Example 0's first transformed row, it's [8,0,8,0...], which is 8 followed by 0. So perhaps inserting 8 between elements and setting the original elements to 0. Wait, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the positions of non-zero elements in the input and output. For Example 0, the input has a 5 at row 1, column 1 (0-based). The output has 5s at row 1, columns 1 and 5 (original and duplicated). Similarly, in Example 1, the input has 6s at row 0 column 2 and row 2 column 1. The output has 6s at row 0 columns 2 and 6, row 2 columns 1 and 5, etc. So the non-zero elements are duplicated in the same row, but mirrored in the duplicated columns.\n\nSo the main pattern seems to be that each row is duplicated in columns (appended to itself), and then between these rows, transformed rows with 8s and 0s are inserted. But how are those transformed rows generated?\n\nLooking at the number of output rows, each input row results in two output rows. For example, Example 0 has 2 input rows \u2192 4 output rows. Example 1 has 3 input rows \u21926 output rows. Example 3 has 4 input rows \u21928 output rows. So each input row is generating two output rows. So the first output row is transformed, the second is duplicated. \n\nSo for each input row:\n\n- Output row 2i: transformed version of input row i.\n\n- Output row 2i+1: duplicated version of input row i.\n\nThe transformed version seems to be created by inserting 8s and 0s. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput row 0 (all zeros) \u2192 transformed row is [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0].\n\nInput row 1 ([0,5,0,0]) \u2192 transformed row is [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] again? No, wait in Example 0's output, row 0 and 2 are the same transformed rows, which are [8,0,8,0...]. So that suggests that the transformed row is the same for all rows, but that doesn't make sense. Because in Example 1, the transformed rows vary.\n\nAlternative idea: the transformed row is the same for all input rows, but that's not the case. For Example 3, the transformed rows are the same as Example 0's. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the transformed row is generated based on the parity of the input row index. For even input rows, transformed row is one pattern, for odd rows, another. But this doesn't hold across examples.\n\nAnother angle: let's look at the rows with 8s. For example, in Example 1's output, there's a row of all 8s. The input row that corresponds to this is the second row of the input, which is all zeros. So maybe when an input row is all zeros, the transformed row is all 8s. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's first input row is all zeros, transformed row is [8,0,8,0...], not all 8s. So that theory is incorrect.\n\nExample 1's second input row is all zeros, and the corresponding transformed row (row 1 of output) is all 8s. So this fits. But the first input row of Example 1 is not all zeros, and its transformed row is [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. Wait, no. The first output row is [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0], which is the duplicated row. The second output row is all 8s. So the transformed row (row 1) corresponds to the input row 0? Or perhaps the transformed rows alternate between the two patterns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformed rows are generated by applying a checkerboard pattern of 8s and 0s, but when the input row has non-zero elements, their positions influence the 8s. For example, the presence of a non-zero element causes the 8s to be placed in certain positions.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to find a concrete pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,4,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0]\n\n[4,0,0]\n\nOutput has 10 rows and 6 columns.\n\nFor example, the third output row is [0,8,8,0,8,0], which seems to have 8s in certain positions.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern. Perhaps I need to look for how the output rows are arranged.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output rows alternate between transformed rows (with 8s and 0s) and duplicated rows (original row followed by itself). For instance:\n\nExample 0:\n\nTransformed row: [8,0,8,0...]\n\nDuplicated row: [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]\n\nRepeats.\n\nExample 1:\n\nFirst row: duplicated row.\n\nSecond row: all 8s.\n\nThird row: transformed row.\n\nFourth row: duplicated row.\n\nFifth row: all 8s.\n\nSixth row: duplicated row.\n\nSo not a simple alternating pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the transformed rows are generated by a combination of the input rows and their neighboring rows. For example, combining the current row and the next row to generate transformed rows. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a combination of the original grid and a new grid with 8s, interleaved. For example, each original row is followed by a row of 8s, but this isn't consistent across examples.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the positions of the 8s in the transformed rows. In Example 0's transformed rows, 8s are at even indices (0, 2, 4, 6). In Example 3's transformed rows, same pattern. In Example 1, there's a row with all 8s. So perhaps the transformed rows are generated by some alternating pattern depending on the row's parity or content.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that the output is generated by first doubling each row's columns by appending a copy of the row, then inserting new rows between them that have 8s in certain positions.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- For each row in the input, create a new row by appending the row to itself (duplicate columns).\n\n- Then, insert a new row before or after each duplicated row, filled with 8s and 0s based on some pattern.\n\nBut in Example 0, the duplicated rows are [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0], and the transformed rows are [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. So the transformed row is different from the duplicated row. Maybe the transformed row is generated by replacing all non-zero elements in the original row with 0 and inserting 8s.\n\nAlternatively, the transformed row is generated by a bitwise operation or some other mathematical transformation of the original row's elements.\n\nAlternatively, the transformed row is generated by taking the original row and inserting 8s between each element. For example, for each element in the original row, insert an 8. So [0,0,0,0] becomes [0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8], but in Example 0's transformed row, it's [8,0,8,0...]. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: the transformed rows are generated by taking the original row and replacing each element with 8 if the element is zero, and the original value if not. But in Example 0's first transformed row, it's [8,0,8,0...], which would require alternating 8 and 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the transformed rows are generated by a pattern that alternates 8 and the original element. For example, for each element in the original row, output 8 followed by the element. So for [0,0,0,0], it would be [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. For [0,5,0,0], it would be [8,0,5,0,8,0,0,0], but this doesn't match the output. So maybe this is the case for the transformed rows when the input row is all zeros. But how to handle non-zero elements.\n\nAlternatively, the transformed row is generated by inserting 8s between the elements of the original row, but then placing 0s elsewhere. But this is unclear.\n\nAfter struggling with this, perhaps I should focus on the test input and see if applying the pattern I think I see works.\n\nTest input:\n\n[0,3,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,3,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,3,0,0,0]\n\nSo it's 6 rows, 5 columns. According to the pattern observed, each row will be duplicated in columns (so each becomes 10 elements), and for each input row, there will be two output rows: one transformed and one duplicated. So the output should have 12 rows (6 input rows \u00d7 2) and 10 columns (5 \u00d7 2).\n\nLet's check the duplicated rows first. Each input row will be duplicated by appending itself. For example, the first input row [0,3,0,0,0] becomes [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]. Wait, no. If the original row is duplicated by appending the same row, then [0,3,0,0,0] becomes [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]. But looking at Example 0's duplicated row: [0,5,0,0] becomes [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. So each element is duplicated. Wait, no. It's the entire row appended to itself. So for row [0,5,0,0], duplicated becomes [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]. Which is appending the same row again. So for the first test input row [0,3,0,0,0], duplicated would be [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]. So columns are doubled by appending the row.\n\nThen, the transformed rows for each input row. The transformed rows seem to be generated by replacing each element in the original row with 8 followed by 0 if the original element is zero. For non-zero elements, perhaps they are followed by 0. For example, if the input is [0,3,0,0,0], the transformed row would be [8,0,3,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, for each zero in the input, insert 8 and 0, and for each non-zero, insert the value and 0. So [0,3,0,0,0] becomes [8,0,3,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. Let's see if this matches any of the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input row [0,0,6,0] becomes transformed row [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]. Which is the duplicated row, not the transformed. The transformed row in Example 1's output is all 8s. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the transformed row is generated by placing 8s in the even positions and the original elements in the odd positions, but only if the original element is non-zero. So for the first test input row [0,3,0,0,0], the transformed row would have 8s in even indices and 3 in index 1. So:\n\n0: 8 (even), 0: index 0 \u21928\n\n1: 3 \u2192 index 1 \u21923\n\n2: 0 \u2192 index 2 \u21928\n\n3: 0 \u2192 index 3 \u21920\n\n4: 0 \u2192 index 4 \u21928\n\nThen duplicated for the entire row. So the transformed row would be [8,3,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]. But I'm not sure if this is the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the transformed row is generated by placing 8s in the even positions of the output row, and the original elements in the odd positions, but only if the original element is non-zero. So for example, the first input row [0,3,0,0,0], which has length 5, would become a transformed row of length 10. The even indices (0,2,4,6,8) are filled with 8, and the odd indices (1,3,5,7,9) are filled with the original elements. But since the original row is 5 elements, perhaps the odd indices are filled with the original elements in sequence. So:\n\nOriginal row: [0,3,0,0,0]\n\nTransformed row even indices (0,2,4,6,8): 8,8,8,8,8\n\nTransformed row odd indices (1,3,5,7,9): 0,3,0,0,0\n\nSo the transformed row would be [8,0,8,3,8,0,8,0,8,0]. This matches a pattern seen in Example 1's third output row [0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8], where 6 is in the odd indices. \n\nIn Example 1's third input row is [0,6,0,0], which after transformation becomes [0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8]. Let's see:\n\nEven indices (0,2,4,6) would be 0,0,0,0 (original elements 0,6,0,0), but the transformed row has 8s in some even positions. Wait, this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformed row is created by placing 8s in even positions and the original elements in odd positions, but shifted. For example, each original element is placed in the next even position. This is getting too vague.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the pattern that each input row is followed by a transformed row where 8s are inserted in even positions and the original elements are in odd positions. For non-zero elements, they are placed in the odd positions, and even positions are 8s. For zeros, the even positions are 8s and odd positions are 0s. \n\nSo for the first test input row [0,3,0,0,0], the transformed row would be:\n\nEven positions (0,2,4,6,8) \u21928s\n\nOdd positions (1,3,5,7,9) \u21920,3,0,0,0\n\nThus: [8,0,8,3,8,0,8,0,8,0].\n\nThen the duplicated row would be [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nRepeating this for each input row.\n\nBut let's check if this matches the training examples. For Example 0's first input row [0,0,0,0], transformed row would be [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0], which matches. The duplicated row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but in Example 0's output, the duplicated row is [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0], which is from the second input row. So the pattern is that each input row generates two output rows: transformed and duplicated.\n\nThus, for the test input:\n\nEach input row will generate two output rows: transformed and duplicated.\n\nThe transformed row is created by placing 8s in even indices and the original elements in odd indices. For example, for an input row of [0,3,0,0,0], the transformed row would be [8,0,8,3,8,0,8,0,8,0].\n\nThe duplicated row is the input row followed by itself, so [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0].\n\nSo applying this to the test input:\n\nTest input has 6 rows. Each will generate two output rows, so 12 output rows.\n\nLet's process each input row:\n\nRow 0: [0,3,0,0,0]\n\nTransformed: [8,0,8,3,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nDuplicated: [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nTransformed: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nDuplicated: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nTransformed: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nDuplicated: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,3,0]\n\nTransformed: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,3,8,0]\n\nDuplicated: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nTransformed: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nDuplicated: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,3,0,0,0]\n\nTransformed: [8,0,8,3,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nDuplicated: [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nPutting it all together, the output would be:\n\n[8,0,8,3,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\n[0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,3,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,8,3,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\n[0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, sometimes there are additional rows with 8s inserted. For example, Example 1 has rows with all 8s. So perhaps my pattern is missing something.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, there's a row of all 8s. That row corresponds to the second input row, which is all zeros. So perhaps when an input row is all zeros, the transformed row is all 8s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's first input row is all zeros, transformed row is [8,0,8,0...]. But according to this theory, it should be all 8s. Which it's not. So that theory is incorrect.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3's output, there are rows with all zeros. For example, the fourth output row is all zeros. This corresponds to the third input row, which is all zeros. So perhaps when an input row is all zeros, the transformed row is all 8s and the duplicated row is all zeros. But in Example 3, the third input row is [0,0,0,0], and the output rows for it are:\n\nTransformed: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nDuplicated: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo yes, the transformed row is [8,0,8,0...], not all 8s. So the theory is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the correct pattern is that each input row generates two output rows: the first is a transformed row where each zero is replaced by 8 and 0, and non-zero elements are replaced by themselves and 0. For example, 0 \u21928,0; 5\u21925,0. So the transformed row for [0,5,0,0] would be [8,5,8,0,8,0,8,0], but this doesn't match Example 0's output. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the transformed row is created by replacing each zero with 8 and each non-zero element with 0. But that doesn't fit either.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity of the examples, I think the most consistent pattern is that each input row is followed by a transformed row where even indices are 8s and odd indices are the original elements. This seems to match Example 0 and Example 3's transformed rows. For example, in Example 0's first input row [0,0,0,0], the transformed row is [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0], which fits this pattern (even indices 8, odd indices 0). For the second input row [0,5,0,0], the transformed row would be [8,0,8,5,8,0,8,0], but the actual transformed row in Example 0's output is the same as the first row. This doesn't fit. So perhaps this pattern only applies to rows with all zeros.\n\nAlternatively, the transformed row for a row with non-zero elements is generated by placing 8s in even indices and the original elements in the odd indices. For example, in the second input row of Example 0, [0,5,0,0], the transformed row would be [8,0,8,5,8,0,8,0], but this isn't present in the output. Instead, the transformed row is the same as the first row, which is [8,0,8,0...]. So this suggests that the transformed rows are not dependent on the input row's elements except for their zeros. So perhaps the transformed row is generated by placing 8s in even indices and 0s in odd indices, regardless of the input row. \n\nBut then, how does Example 1's third output row [0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8] fit this pattern? This seems to have 6s and 8s in odd indices. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Given the time, I'll proceed with the initial pattern I identified: each input row is followed by a transformed row with 8s in even indices and 0s in odd, and the duplicated row is the input row appended to itself. \n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nEach input row generates two output rows. The transformed row has 8s in even indices and 0s in odd. The duplicated row is the input row followed by itself.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRow 0: [0,3,0,0,0]\n\nTransformed: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nDuplicated: [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nTransformed: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nDuplicated: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nTransformed: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nDuplicated: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,3,0]\n\nTransformed: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nDuplicated: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nTransformed: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nDuplicated: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,3,0,0,0]\n\nTransformed: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nDuplicated: [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nSo the output rows would be:\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\n[0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0]\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\n[0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nBut looking at the training examples, such as Example 3, which has non-zero elements, the transformed rows are alternating 8 and 0, and the duplicated rows have the non-zero elements duplicated. This seems to fit. However, in Example 1, there are rows with non-zero elements in the transformed rows, which suggests that my current approach is missing something. But given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this pattern and adjust based on the test input.",
